[whistle blowing] [crowd cheering] [insects humming] [door creaking] - Cornelius? Oh! Oh, my God! Oh! I prayed for this so hard, and I wasn't sure it was gonna happen. Oh, this is a joyous day. Let me look at you. Where's your face? And you smell a little bit like a caribou. And you're skinny. I'm gonna give you some food, okay? Have you seen your brother? He's out there. He's out in the barn. He's painting. Oh, my God. It's so good to have you home. It is so good to have you home. - Jesus Christ. So where were you? - Doesn't matter. - Matters to me. I mean, you just up and left. Didn't say good-bye. Where'd you go? - Amos, you got to slow down, man. - You planning to stay? - There. Now, this is a very special occasion. It has been a great many years since the Rawlings brothers have sat down at this table. So I don't want to hear any of this, "I'm not hungry," "I ate before," "I'm too busy." We're gonna eat this meat, okay? And let me just say, let me be the first to tell you that it is a pleasure to have you back at this table, Corny. - Don't call me that. - I'm sorry. It is a pleasure to have you back at this table, Con. And would it be asking too much for you to tell us where you've been for the past 18 years? - Yes. - Okay, now, I think that is just selfish, because we have been worried sick about you, and I have a sinking feeling that you haven't thought about us even once since you've been gone. Is that true? - Keep it up, Ezra, and he's gonna leave again, okay? You're gonna be stuck here with your pots and your pans and your aprons and all your fucking bullshit. - Why-why do I even do this? Why do I do this for you guys? You guys-you don't respect me. - Because you're fucked in the head. You need therapy, my friend. You're mentally ill. - You're the one out there in the barn painting people cutting their wee-wees off and eating doo-doo. - That just helps me from fucking killing myself. - This is not-this is bes- [door slamming] Is he leaving? Is he gone again? - You are such a fucking cunt. You okay? Con? Come back inside. [footsteps approaching] [knocking at door] - Boys? Why don't you put on clothes and come to church with Wilbur and I? I know you can hear me, Amos. - Do I ever go to church? Ever? I never go to church, okay? Just let us sleep. - Okay. But we are gonna go by the creek at Laughing Gap. We're gonna have a picnic there today, okay? I want no complaining, and it's a command performance. All right? - Okay. - All right. Now, good morning, gentlemen. - Jesus Christ. - Well, I just want to say that I feel very lucky to have my boys out here, 'cause I know you think picnics are stupid, and they're just for lovebirds. But they're not. A picnic is a glorious activity, and it's for absolutely everyone. And it's gonna be beautiful. - Well, the fellowship group from the church went on on a picnic last weekend. - Yes, they did, Wilbur. You brought a bunny home from that, didn't you? - Mm-hmm. Lops. - I'm fucking tired as shit. - Well, Amos, if you're tired, you should go to bed when I say. I'm thinking about reinstating the lights out rule. Oh, look! Oh, let's go here. Oh, this is a glamorous spot. I'm gonna put the blanket right here. Mm. Wilbur, bring me that basket, sweetheart. I have got delicious things. I brought apples, and I baked a pie, and we have wine. We have wine. Oh, that's the spirit, Amos. Get right in there. When you give me the finger, Amos, you have one finger at me and four at yourself. Oh, I think this is beautiful. Look at him. He looks like a little fish. - Connie, come in the water. It feels really good. - [laughs] Well, that's one way of doing it. Would you like an apple, Wilbur? - Oh, yes. - I want you to drink the most of this wine, because when you get drunk, you're a sweetheart. When they get drunk, they're mean. - Well, I-I really don't even like to drink, except when you- you make me drink. - Here comes the choo-choo. Wilbur, why don't you give me that basket? - Oh. - Boys, it's such a nice night, I think I'm gonna grill out. You get washed up, and I'm gonna get the grill going, okay? Thank you, Amos. - You want to get in the shower first? - No. - You want to take one together? - No. - Remember when we used to take baths together when we were little? - No. - You don't remember that? Remember the time you cut your hand on the soap dish and the bathtub filled up with blood? Hey. What, did it erase your mind, the last fucking 15 years? No? You happy to be home? You miss Mom and Dad? - Coming home  Coming home  Nevermore to roam  Open wide Thine arms of love  Lord, I'm coming home  I've wasted many precious years  [electronic beeping] Hey, Con. Connie. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Connie. Where you going? - For a walk. - You're coming back. - If I don't get arrested. - And we shot it, and it hit a car. I thought the car was gonna explode. And this year, I had this little firework thing that had a little guy on a parachute. It was made of plastic, and it blowed up. But it got stuck on the tree. And then I had this other one that was like a rocket, and I taped a little paper guy to it, and he, like, burned up, 'cause I couldn't see him, where the rocket landed. But all I found where the rocket landed was a piece of plastic that was the top. And then we had this other one that was about, like, this big, and it spun around. And it starts-and it explodes. - Oh, man, it's hot outside. - Yeah, it is. - Do you want to play me in tennis? - We're already playing. - Do you want to play for $50? - Do you have $50? - Does this look like $50? - Yeah. - I'm gonna need to borrow his racket. - Sure. - Ah. - Hey, what the fuck? Hey, what are you doing with my nozzle? Hey! Do you work here? - [breathing deeply] [urine splashing] [toilet flushing] - Get up. [thunder crashing] - Hey, Con. You know, I used to sit out in the rain like this with Daddy. He'd drink whiskey. I'd drink lemonade. You weren't born yet. Amos, what are you doing way over there? Come on over. Have a beer with your brothers. I'd be lying if I told you I understood that boy. But I love him. [thunder rumbling] [rain pounding] [birds chirping] [knocking at door] Come in. Oh, hey, Wilbur. - Uh, hey, Ezra. - Hey, there. All right, have a seat, sweetheart. You know I don't like- - But look what I got here. - Okay, have a seat, sweetheart. I don't like people standing around my kitchen. - Right here? - Yes. What you got? - Um, it's a VHS camcorder. And I dug it up outside. And, um, well, um, I made a movie on it. - You did? - Yeah. And I thought, um- I thought you might like to see it. Um, it's pretty neat. It's just a- - Well, okay. Well, I'll take a look at it. - How these things work, uh, you- you just have to look right here. - Look right in there? - Yeah, look in there and press the Play button. And, uh, I think it should be- it should be on the part that... What do you think? - Wilbur, you made this movie? - Yeah. - This is exceptional. This is- - Well, I wouldn't called it exceptional. I mean- - Oh, I would. - It's just a- - This is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life. I had no idea you were this talent- this is inc- Wilbur. - Well, you haven't seen that much of it, Ezra. - Oh, my Lord. Where-I- this is done. We're gonna have an art show. We're gonna show this to the world. I'm gonna-we're gonna get the church basement. We're gonna invite all those fine folk over there in. I'm gonna make popcorn. I'm gonna serve lemonade. [Daniel Boone's Beautiful Sunday]  - Sunday morning, up with a lark  I think I'll take a walk  - I feel kind of dead. Don't you feel kind of like you're like walking dead? This isn't blood. This is love jam, and it's what connects the two lovers. I think it's very romantic. Who's in your bedroom normally at night? I call this one Breakfast, because it's the most important meal of the day. And we have some snacks over there too if you guys want to help yourself. - Beautiful Sunday  This is my, my, my beautiful day  When you say, say, say  - Well, good evening, everybody. Welcome to the art party. I hope that you've enjoyed Amos's paintings. Amos has informed me that his paintings are not for sale, which is a shame. I hope this might change. But secondly, and last but not least, the beautiful video stylings of Wilbur Cunningham. Wilbur, would you come up and say a few words before that? Wilbur, you're a genius. Come up here for a second. Wilbur Cunningham, ladies and gentlemen. [applause] - Thanks for coming to the fellowship hall to see the video I made. I found this video player in our yard the other day, and I made a video in a part of the yard that is really nice during that time of the day. And the leaves look really nice during that time of the day. - That's very nice, Wilbur. Very nice, very nice. All right, ladies and gentlemen. - Play the video. Come on. - Quiet, Amos. [birds chirping] - This video reflects the wildness of the jungle. Your mind can go anywhere when you're looking at things with an open eye. When I have my eyes open, I see all kinds of things out there, even small things, and bigger things too. And some things are looming, looming right over you. Hey, Amos. I have one more cookie here if you want it. - No. - Did you like the video? - I don't know anything about video. Did you enjoy doing it? - Mm-hmm. - Well, keep going, man. Keep doing what you're doing. - Well, I really like to play guitar. I've been playing your guitar, if that's okay. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's fine. [strange bubbling] [door clicking] - Oh, my God! [screaming] Oh, my God. It never ends. - What? - The filth. - I think the septic tank threw up. There's shit everywhere in the bathroom. - Really? Check it out. I've been doing that a lot lately. - You're drawing pictures with shit in 'em? - Yeah, that, too, but just drawing things in general that are happening. Like I drew pictures of you, and then you came home. - Draw us winning the lottery. - That's a good idea. - That is a pretty dress, Savannah. You know, sometimes I think you dress too prettily. Aren't you afraid that some guy is gonna come up and touch you? I mean, not that you're a slut or anything. What we got to do is get you some sweatpants. Oh. Ah! Ugh. Ugh. [laughs] [van engine humming] - Can I come in? - Do you plumb? No. You just sit there and make sure you don't set anybody's loins on fire. - Thank you for coming on such short notice. - You're quite welcome. - Thank you. I have some cookies in the oven if you want a little snack before you start. It's still kind of a mess in there. - Oh, that's okay. - Would you like some cookies, sweetheart? Does your daughter like cookies? - She's not my daughter. - Well, let me- let me show you, okay? - Okay. - And this is- I'm a little embarrassed. This is really- it's quite a mess. - Don't worry. You're not gonna show me anything I haven't seen. - All right, well, right this way. - I'm the Rooster. - Hi. - Hey. - Is that your kitten? - I'm taking care of her for a little while. - What's her name? - What's your name? - Savannah. - Maybe we'll call her Savannah. Do you like that? - Okay. Can I hold her? - 'Course. - Here, little kitty. Hi, baby. She's cute. - She's hungry. - Are you hungry? Hmm? - Listen, I'm gonna have to come back tomorrow. You think you can deal without flushing for a day or so? - Oh, we have plenty of places to go. - Okay, good. Savannah? Savannah! [whistle blowing] [metal clatters] Savannah? - I have to go. Bye. - I appreciate you coming, Rooster. - My pleasure. Where have you been? Where have you been? - I was looking at the land. - "I was looking at the land." Does it meet with your approval? Get in the van. - When can I expect you tomorrow? - I'd say about 12:00. - Good-bye, sweetheart. [engine revving] [whistle tweeting] [crowd cheering and chanting] - Plumber came by today. - So what? - It was Coach Rippington. You remember him. The Red Rooster? Yeah, he's a plumber now, apparently. He was with some little girl. - If he was with a girl, it wasn't Coach Rippington. - Oh, Amos, that's love- that's very, very nice. It's different from your other work. It looks like a comic strip. I like it. - Life is like a comic. Every panel represents a block of time. And over the course of someone's life, those panels come together to tell a story. Now, most people think they can write their own story. They made big plans. They have big expectations. But every now and then, someone shows up and changes everything. - Well, I like it very much. - You were so great at football, Connie. You could've played college. Could've gone pro. Remember that 70-yard touchdown you scored against Hendersonville? You catched that pass, and then you fucking spun around like a little ballerina. Fucking went left, went right. Fucking juked those two players. Fucking Rawlings has the football, fucking barrels over the linebackers. He's in the clear. He's at the 40, the 30, the 20, the 10, touchdown, fucking 15, Cornelius Rawlings. Fucking crowd was going fucking nuts. I was on the sidelines. I was fucking bawling. I was so proud of you. You were the artist, not me. Remember that time during practice when all those fucking football players surrounded me, and they were taunting me, calling me sissy and fucking pussy and queer? And you came to fucking defend me? I mean, I'm the older brother. I was supposed to defend you. The only reason I went out for the football team to begin with is because I wanted to be close to you. I know I sucked. Remember that little fucking water boy, Chuckie Jones, the little fucking faggot? God, I wanted to suck him off so badly. Coach Rippington. He never put me in once. I didn't give a shit. You know, sometimes I wish I was gay. - Why? - You know, artists are supposed to be open-minded, right? I mean, they're supposed to be experimental, open to anything, willing to try anything. I think I always had the potential to be gay. Think it's too late for me, though. It's too repressed. You know? Because of Dad. Dad was a homophobe. What was the name of that hot dog stand we used to go to? Remember the one that closed down when we were little? What was the name of that place? - Gary's Footlongs. - Gary's Footlongs, yeah. Dad took me to that place one time. And there were two people sitting in front of us, and one of them had pink spiked hair, and the other one had earrings. And Dad turned to me, and he said, "Look at those two goddamn faggots." Then he asked me. He said, "Amos, are you a goddamn faggot?" And I was terrified. I said, "No, Daddy. No, I'm not a goddamn faggot." And he slapped me in the face. He said, "Don't you ever curse in front of me, boy." I hated that goddamn son of a bitch. I miss Mommy. Don't you miss Mommy? You know, I thought about killing myself so many times. But I didn't because I knew you'd come home. Why'd you leave us? - Blood in the water  Mud on the ground  Skulls in the forest  Evil is all around  Smother the demons  Smother the demons  both: Smother the demons  Smother the demons  [together] Smother the demons  Smother the demons  Smother the demons  - Smother the demons  [knocking at door] - Savannah. - Hey, it's all right. Hey, it's all right. - Who's this guy? Who is he? - He look like a caveman junkie to me. - Do you want to play Horse? - Horse? - Horse? - For $50? - $50? Do you got $50? - You got $50? - I have $50. - Horse? We can play one-on-one. - Play you one-on-one for $50? - Play one-on-one, $50. - Okay. Should I shoot for it? - I'll just let you have ball first. swish! - Ooh. - Boy can shoot. Whoa. - He won't make another one. - Oh, yeah? [rim rattles] - Whoa. - Eat him up, baby. - It's time to play now. Shit! - Whoa. Damn! - Mike, he killing you. - Where you learn that from? [laughter] [coughing and retching] [groaning] - Yeah. Nice and comfortable. Nice, cozy princess. - No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! Amos, there is a very serious development afoot. What are you doing? - I'm thinking. - I am missing my very important last piece to my very important puzzle that is very important to me. Have you seen it? - Uh, yeah, I think I have seen it, actually. Is this it? - No, that is not it, and you know it isn't. I swear to you, Amos, if you have anything to do with this, you are going to be very, very sorry. - It's pretty important to you. - Yes, it is extremely important to me. - I took it, okay? I was just trying to get your goat. And I'm sorry, Ezra. Okay? - Amos. You are on my last nerve. Do you understand that? My last one. I could spit hornets, I'm so mad. You are going to sleep in that tire, and Wilbur's going to come inside. And you are never going to see a roof over your head again. Is that perfectly clear? - You're the reason Mom killed herself. - What? You take it back! - Get off of me. - You take it back, and you get your ass right in that fucking house before I rip it in half. You hear me? You hear me? - Get off of me! - Oh, the plumber's here. - You see what's going on here? These people are crazy as shithouse rats. You stay in this van. You understand me? You don't get out of this van. What the hell does this smiley want? What? - Double or nothing? - Are you sure about that? It's $500. - Just throw the can. - So it's just the four of us now. It's the two boys and Wilbur, who takes care of the maintenance. Our parents are long gone. We don't even farm anymore. - Yeah. - The government pays us not to farm, so we don't. - [laughing] Yeah, I figured you guys were a bunch of freeloaders. [tinkling music]  - What's that? - I think it's a music box. - It's pretty. - It is. Do you want it? - No. He'd never let me. - Who? - The Red Rooster. - Well, listen, you should take it. It's a present. You have to take a present. [saw whirring] - Hey. Hey! - Ah! - Ah. You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You are? - Mm-hmm. - What are you doing over here? I mean- - I'm just working on stuff. What do you want? - Have you seen a little girl around, a little girl? - I saw one by the van earlier. - Yeah, well, that must be the one I'm looking for. Have you seen her down here? - She's not in here. - Oh, well, okay. Boy. - Wow, look at all this. [whistling] A screaming tree. [laughs] That's very-God, that's pretty cool, spooky. How much you want for that screaming tree? - It's not for sale. - Well, I'd give you $10 for it right now. Take a check? - You don't remember me, do you? - I don't think so. - Coach? You were a football coach, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, I was on your team years ago. - Oh. - My name's Amos Rawlings. I wasn't very good. My brother Cornelius was on the team too. He was great. You liked him a lot. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Savannah! [sweet music]  What are you doing? What are you doing? - He wants me to have this. - So have it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's get in the truck. - And this is why we keep walking, 'cause if we don't, no one else will. both: And why were we chosen? - Because we were. - Well, I think this Red Rooster is doing a fabulous job. He's a little gruff, but I think he's a professional. - I think he sucks. - Why do you always do this? Why the both of you? Why always so angry and negative? Do you not know how unattractive that is? - As always, Ezra, you have no idea what's going on. You're clueless, as always. - Yeah, that is true. And do you know why? Because neither of you ever tell me anything. - Ask him. Ask Cornelius. The Red Rooster, Coach Rippington, they're the same person. He was our football coach. I know why you left now. It was the game against Highbrighton. You dropped the ball. Big deal. It was third game in the season. It didn't mean anything. I waited for you after the game. Coach called you in the office. I waited a long time. That's when he did it, right? - What's he talking about, Connie? What did he do to you? What did he do to you? [knocking at door] - Can I help you? [door slams] - I think the better question is, can I help you? That's right. This house is unclean. - No. No, I-I clean this house every day. - You clean the house? - Every day. - So I guess you didn't see the snakes on the floor then, or the 3-inch invisible rat in the snake's mouth, or the ten dimensions of hell up underneath it. - We've-we've had plumbing problems under the house. - Excuse me? May I sit down? - Amos, get up. - Who the hell is this guy? - Get up, Amos. - Now, I want somebody to tell me what's making my skin crawl in this house. - Tell him, Connie. Tell him. - The Red Rooster. - The Red Rooster? - Coach Rippington. - He's a plumber. - He's not a plumber. - He's not a plumber. The Lord wants us to discombobulate this rooster by crossing his wires and humbling the evil out of him. Now, I sense he remembers not what he has done, which is why we must massage him into a confusion with mysterious words and phrases. We will lure him back to this house tonight to purge both him and you of this evil which courses through your veins, my brothers. - How you gonna do that? - What time is it? You have a telephone? - Yes. [phone ringing] - Hello? - Yeah, is this, uh- Is this Red Rooster plumbing? I thought a plumber was supposed to unclog pipes. But it says here that you clog 'em. Do you get a little cock-a-doodle on your doo-doo? - Who is this? [phone ringing] God damn it. Hello? - You ever been force-fed a cheeseburger by your mama sitting next to a man with half a body? Let me tell you. There's a before that experience and an after it. And I guess you're talking to a after it. - Who was that? - Hush. - Now, you need to perpetrate a prank call of your own and get him over here right now. [phone ringing] - All right, that's it. Listen to me, you son of a bitch. You better quiet down. You got that? Or I'm gonna come over there and quiet you down. - Red Rippington? - Who's this? - This is Ezra Rawlings. You've been working out here this week. I'm fine. How are you? Look, I don't know what you did, but one of the pipes you've installed, I think it's burst or something. I mean, we have a hell of a flood out here. Uh-huh. I understand that, and I'm willing to pay you overtime if you come here right now. I mean, this is a serious flood, sir. Uh-huh. I appreciate it. Bye-bye. - Hallelujah, gentlemen. - God damn it. - What? - I go to go back to that shithole farm. They've flooded it. They must have been messing around with something. - Can I come with you? - No. You stay here. - But it's scary here. - It's much scarier there. - Not if I'm with you. - Well, okay. Get your sweatpants on. We'll go. Hey! Where you going? God damn it. [sighs] [knocking at door] Hello? [pounding at door] Hello? [muffled groaning] [knocking at door] - Oh, hey, Savannah. Uh, come on in. - What are you reading? - Oh, it's a old Indian fable I found in the house. I think Cornelius is in here. - I like the pictures. - Yeah. They're really ornate. - Do you want to look at the stars with me? - Yeah. It's a nice, cool night out. I'd love to. - Come on. You see any constellations? [flames roaring] - What did you do to him? What did you do to him? You fuck. - "I will be his God, and he shall be my son. "But as for the cowardly and the unbelieving "and the abominable and murderers "and fornicators and sorcerers "and idolaters and all liars, "their portion shall be in the pool that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death." - What are we gonna do with him? - We're gonna fuckin' kill him. - It's time. Let's take this man out of here. - The day of miracles has come. - [muffled screaming] - Where's Ezra? - All right. Now, I know you gonna crucify this son of a bitch and all, but I want you to know that this is what I like from now on. And this is what I'm gonna wear from now on. - Well, that's exactly why we're gonna start with you, Mama. You are not their mother. - I am their mother. I am such a good mother. You tell this man that I am a good mother. - Get down on your knees. You are not their mother. - Yes, I am! - You are not. You are your mother's son. You are your brother's brother. You cannot protect them. You cannot save them from the past. - No, no, no, no, no. Protect them. That's all I want to do. That's all I want to do. - Then protect me. - Shut up. - You're not our mother, Ezra. - [speaking in tongues] Oh, yes, I sense a demon of fear that is paralyzing you, my son. There's something evil inside of you. - There is. - What is it? - A monster. - It's not a monster. It's you. You are not evil. The evil is your inability to accept what's inside of you. - [screaming] I accept him. - This night, this time, we shall be redeemed. You have been wronged. But you are strong. I want you to listen to me, and you listen good. You are not damaged goods. You are good. Now say it with me. You are not damaged goods. You are good. You are not damaged goods. You are good. I want you to say it. Say it! - I am not damaged goods. I am good. [together] I am not damaged goods. I am good. - Say it. I cast you into the fire, oh, demon of sodomy. - I am not damaged goods. I am good. - Demon of hell. - I am not damaged goods! I am good! I am not damaged goods! I am good! - Oh, I sense it, Lord! Oh, oh! I cast you into the fire! - Thank you. - Are you ready to get right with God? You want to get on the same page with the Lord, boy? - Yeah. - I didn't hear you. - Yes. - Say it again. Are you really sorry? - Yes, I'm sorry. - But you've been living in hell for some time, haven't you? - Yes, I have. But it only- I only did it one time. - You did it one time? What about that sweet little girl you're so abusive to? Huh? - I swear to God. I never touched her. I got her out of a bad situation. Y'all been making up all this shit. I love Savannah. I love her like my mama loved me. [sobbing] Throw me in that damn fire. - Now you listen to me. We're gonna untie you now so that you can perform your final act of penance. All right, now stand up. Red Rippington, chop down that ungodly tree. - [coughs] [grunting] [crowd cheering] [cheering growing louder] [cheering growing louder] [insects humming] [rooster crows in distance] [melancholy acoustic guitar music]  - Sing a song. - Oh, okay. I will knock in all the doorways  I will visit all the houses  I will always be down the road  - As my footsteps go around them  Fellow passers will not see me  Splashing in the muddy puddles  And it all came from long ago  It was a long time ago, long time ago  And it all came from long ago  It was a long time ago, long time ago  And it all came from long ago  Fearful connivers making promises to buyers  Who were leasing out the houses on the road  And it all came from long ago  It was a long time ago, long time ago  It was a long time ago, long time ago  Pharisees were similar  Just calculating criminals  It was a long time ago  And it all came from long ago  I will knock in all the doorways  I will visit all the houses  I will always be down the road  As my footsteps go around them  Fellow passers will not see me  Splashing in the muddy puddles  And it all came from long ago
