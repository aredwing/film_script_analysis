Toes the rubber, starts his wind-up and delivers a fastball low and outside. Just missed the corner for ball two. Looks like he's a little bit uncomfortable with his rotator. Still having trouble with that shoulder. Certainly seems to have trouble finding the plate that's for sure. Come on. He's already walked four batters. It appears that's going to be all as Leonard is going to be pulled by manager Frank... Sometimes I think the day he made my daddy God wasn't thinking straight. She's coming home today. She's coming home? Uh-huh. How come? They've done all they can for her for now. What's romantic fever, Aunt Nadine? What? What Mama has... romantic fever. It's not "romantic fever. " It's rheumatic fever. What is it? It's a heart thing. She's had it since she was your age. I thought you knew that. I thought it was "romantic. " What are you doing? Waiting. Mama's with her. We can't go in yet. Hi, Ellen. Well, can I go in? No. Well, move over. If I was my mother, I'd stay right here in the hospital... folks patting your head and bringing you fruit baskets. I would stay right here. You don't look to me like you should be leaving here. You look like the dickens. I'm okay. The doctor told me you need plenty of bed rest and no exertions. Now, I want... I want you to come home with me. What for? The same reason as always... to live. What about Ellen? My offer is the same as always, too. You expect me to go and live with you and leave her with him? Well, she's his daughter. She's my daughter, too. Trash begets trash. It don't matter who he sires it on. I'm too tired for this, Mama. It's the last time I make the offer. Well, that'll be a relief. Thanks, honey. Oh! Looks like Charlotte turned her down again. You don't have to come in. Are you sure? I'm fine. We'll call you later. Okay. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye. It's off the wall, inside corner... Hey. Hey. How you doing? Not too bad. Well, you're just in time for lunch. What we having? I had to cook for my own self the whole time you was gone. Maybe you can lie down a bit first. I'm fine, honey. Let's go see what we got, huh? This place is a mess since you been gone. It needs a good cleaning-up. I can't stand being in a mess. It reminds me of when I was a kid. I tried to keep it cleaned up. I know. I could see that when I first came in. Well, you ought to teach her how to do it right. What are you looking at? Why don't you eat? I don't have an appetite. What was it you turned your mama down about? What, honey? At the hospital. Aunt Betsy said you turned your mama down about something. You can tell she was real ticked off. Well, she wanted me to come and live with her. Well, why don't we... you and me? We'd be much better off over there. Can't. But why not? She's got that humongous house and you wouldn't have to be cooking or cleaning or whatnot. Are you okay? I'm just catching my breath. I don't think you should've turned her down, Mama. Had to, hon. Always had to. How come? Oh, 'cause... she won't take you in, too. I don't like you knowing that. Why won't she take me in, too? She thinks you're more your daddy's daughter than mine and she has an intense dislike of your daddy. I think you know that. She's sure got it wrong about me and him. If you wasn't here, I'd run away. You know you're my favorite person in the whole world. You know that? You're my favorite person, too. You're smart and you're strong and you can get along no matter what happens. I absolutely know that. You remember I told you that, won't you? Mm-hmm. Hey. Mmm. Here. You want anything else? No, thank you, hon. I'll read you something, okay? From the Bible? Mm-hmm. My favorite part. You want to hear my favorite part? Sure do. "To everything there is a season "and a time to every purpose under the heaven. "A time to be born and a time to die "a time to plant "and a time to pluck up that which is planted "a time to kill and a time to heal "a time to break down and a time to build up "a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance. " I think I'll just have myself a little nap. You sure you don't want nothing else? No, thank you, hon. I'm fine. I'll stay here with you. Just for a little while, I'll stay here with you. I hate it so when people say they're fine. You know they're not and they know it, too. Why's all the lights out? How's a man supposed to see in the pitch dark? Come on, get up. Other people got to get in here, too. I'll sleep where I want to. Get up. You can go sleep in your truck. I sleep where I want to! I sleep where I want to! Mama, get back in the bed. Mama. Shh. It's okay. Shh. Shh, Mama. Shh. The first day of every month my daddy's brother Rudolph would bring some cash money in an envelope and I would make sure I would get it before my daddy did. I figured out what I needed and I took it. You got the lights and the gas to be paid up, food and extras. And I'd let him have the rest. Mama? Mama? Mama? I should have taken better care of her. I should have just put my foot down and said "Look here, Mama, you can't be doing "all this cooking and cleaning up and what-not. You have to be in bed getting rested like Aunt Betsy said. " I should have put my foot down. I think that'll be on my mind for quite a long time. Mama, I have to go. Not now, sweetie. Can't we stop? Hold it, pumpkin, all right? "... Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life... " My baby. "Earth to earth "ashes to ashes, dust to dust "in sure and certain hope of the resurrection "to eternal life through our lord Jesus Christ "who shall change our mortal body "that it may be like "unto his glorious body "according to the mighty work whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself. " Oh, you rotten piece of trash! You're the one who should be in that box you scum! Why is it that somebody like my daughter dies and you don't?! You took off and ruined her! Ruined her life! Broke her heart! Scarred her soul! May God in his wisdom strike you dead If somebody else don't do it for us first! Seemed to me she might have got hold on her natural meanness for her own daughter's funeral at least. I guess she hated my daddy more than she loved my mama. It didn't seem proper to me. I think at a funeral everybody should love everybody else. Starletta, wait up. Bye. Bye. My mama says your mama passed on. Uh-huh. That's why you wasn't at school? Uh-huh. My mama said to say she's real sorry and she hopes she'll come by soon to say it her own self. Okay. You're going to have to catch up on your homework. How you doing? Fine. What's in the box? Just some beads And things. My Mama used to let me play with that. She won't be letting you play with it anymore. You tell your daddy the message is plain and simple. Now get it right. You listening?! You tell him that I'd rather some tramp had my Charlotte's things than any of you bunch that drink and carry on like trash. I'm sorry, hon. Hi, honey! Hi. I just stopped by to see how you getting along. Is your daddy here? He's not home much anymore. Where is he? I don't know. Sometimes he comes home to sleep but I think all he's doing now is drinking and sleeping. What you doing? Playing catalog. What's that? First I pick out a little family and then house stuff and clothes. Sleepwear and fancy jackets for the man and pantsuits and I outfit everybody... the mom and the dad and the kids. The kids are cute. Next, they get some camping equipment and a waffle iron and bedroom suits and some toys. And the daddy who works in a factory and the mama... she works at a bank. They like to dress up after work. And I also find the best values. That's real clever. How you doing for food? Okay. You eating regular? Sure. What are you eating? Frozen stuff from the store in tin things. TV dinners?! I guess. How are you fixed for money? Uncle Rudolph's still bringing it. He is? Not as much as before, though. Why is he giving us the money anyway? It's not Rudolph giving you the money. I thought you knew that. How am I supposed to know? Nobody tells me anything. Who is? Your grandma. She's the one that's been giving us all the money? For your mother. Mama's dead. Well, I guess she just... doesn't have it in her heart to starve a child, despite her feelings. Don't tell her I told you that. It's supposed to be a secret. Well, how could I tell her? She hasn't hardly said two words in a row to me in my whole life. Well, she never been too good about children even her own. Except for your mother, Charlotte. She was her favorite. The sun never set on Charlotte. Which one of these hats do you think looks better on her? This one or... or this one? We got to do something. Like what? I don't know. Something. She can't be on her own over there with that drunk, eating TV dinners. It's Charlotte's fault for marrying him in the first place. That's water and bridges, Nadine. We're talking about now. Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why not? He's her father. He needs a stepstool to look a worm in the eye. He's still her father. She should be with real family. Why don't you take her? Me? Might do you good to have a kid around. Why would you say that knowing how I feel about children? If I wanted a kid, I would have gotten married. Besides, if I took her I'd have to deal with Mama all the time. The less I do with Mama, the better. Why can't you take her? No. Dora hates her. My nerves couldn't stand it. Also, she makes me nervous. I guess I know what you mean. She can be weird sometimes. She reminds me of Charlotte sometimes when Charlotte was her age. You were always jealous of Charlotte. Oh, look who's talking. Let's not get into it. Water and bridges. Big smile now. Good! Do you believe in Santa Claus? Sure I do. You? Uh-uh. I'm glad I don't. Like my daddy says "Wish in one hand and spit in the other. See which one gets filled up first. " I won't be going spitting in my hand. That's disgusting. My mama said she believed in Santa Claus lots longer than I did. I think she wanted me to believe in him longer. But that was in the old days when she was little. Things change. I think you're missing something not believing in Santa Claus. I'm going to believe in him as long as I can. Then you got a good wishing hand. You want to see what I got for your Mama and daddy? See? Ooh! It's pretty. What's it for? Putting spoons in. I believe my mom's got one of them. Well, now she's got two. Hey, boy, hey! A merry Christmas! It is Christmas Day, isn't it? Why, of course. I knew I hadn't missed it! All the spirits have done it all in one night! It couldn't be like it used to be with Mama but it's a long time till next Christmas. Maybe things will turn around by then. Well, would you look here at this? Always use one of these. Keeps your spoons from dripping on the stove. I figured maybe you can use one. Never can have enough of these. Well, it looks to me like we got one more present here. Says... "To Ellen, from Santa. " I think this child here is the only one we know called "Ellen. " Ain't that right? Right as rain. For me? You have been a good girl, right? What is it? Well, open it up, child. Open it up! Open it up! Oh, it's a sweater! It sure is. Can I put it on? I'd like to put it on right now if that's okay. Put it right on. Color's pretty, Mama, ain't it? Oh, it just suits her perfect. Couldn't be prettier. I was sort of in need of a sweater. I have to go pretty soon. Got to get home. Your daddy home tonight? Haven't seen hide nor hair of Daddy in two or three days. Well, why don't you stay here? What are you gonna when you get back? I'll stay busy. You come on back here whenever you want to. If your daddy ain't home when you get there you come right on back over here, you hear? You come right on back. To stay? How do you mean, honey? To stay, all the time, here. Yeah. Why would you want to stay here all the time, sweetheart? I like it much better here now that my mom's not home anymore. You got to be missing your mama real bad. We know that. Honey, we would take you in in a minute if we could. Why can't you? Don't you like me enough? 'Course we like you. We're very fond, Ellen. You know that. It's okay if you don't. No hard feelings. Truth of it is, we wouldn't be allowed to take you in permanent. Allowed by who? Other folks. What other folks? Who'd care? There's folks that just wouldn't tolerate it. Well, why the heck not? 'Cause we're different colors, you and us. But that don't matter anymore. We got integration. Not altogether, honey. Not altogether. But it wouldn't be anybody's business but us. There's those would make it their business and that's just the way of it. Now you're welcome to come here and visit us anytime you please but that other part... Well, it ain't in the cards just yet. Now y'all finish your food so we can get some of that sweet potato pie. "To everything there is a season "and a time to every purpose under the heaven. "A time to be born and a time to die; "a time to plant "and a time to pluck up that which is planted; "a time to kill and a time to heal; "a time to break down and a time to build up; "a time to weep and a time to laugh; "a time to mourn... and a time to dance. " This one's for you. This one's for your lowlife brother. May he choke on it. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Now, who told you you could do that? Who told you you could do it? Nobody told me. I had to. Oh, you had to. You had to steal my money. I wasn't stealing. Stuff had to be paid. They shut down the electric last month. Don't you remember? Get in the closet. Get in there! Get in there! I pay the bills around here! Any bills to be paid, I pay them! You understand that?! I'm the man of this house! I didn't hit you. You hear me? I didn't hit you. Remember that. In the dark I gathered my head and all that spinning and flying out from me and wondered. Oh, you have to wonder what this world's come to. Hello. This is Ellen. I-I'm fine. How are you? I was wondering if I-I could come stay with you. Okay. What do you want to do this weekend? Well, do you still have that fancy bathtub with the thing in it? The Jacuzzi? I guess. Must be neat to have a bath in that. You want to take a bath in my Jacuzzi? You got it. Just make yourself right at home. Then we'll go shopping. What happened to your face? I fell. Having fun? Uh-huh. We're going to have a lovely day tomorrow and then I'll take you back after supper. Take me back where? Home. Home? After supper tomorrow. I asked if I could come and stay with you and you said fine. And I got all the stuff I brought back in your bedroom closet. Oh, hon, I meant you could stay for the weekend and then go back home. Really? What did you think I meant? That I could come and stay with you. Well, sorry about that misunderstanding. Me, too. Little more clay slip, Jocelyn. These are looking great, you guys. Try a little more color right in there why don't you? Which color? Surprise me. Wow. What happened to your face, Ellen? I fell. Let me see. It's okay. We only want to help you, Ellen. You understand that, don't you? We know things have been a bit difficult for you since your mother passed on. We just want to do whatever we can to help you through this difficult time. You can tell us the truth, Ellen. You don't have to be frightened. You remember last winter when the lady from Social Services came by to talk to your dad? No. Well, she did. We understand you've been having some difficulties at home. Now, did you really fall down the stairs? My daddy did it. But I'm used to it. Don't everyone get in an uproar about it. Do you have somewhere you could spend the night, hon? Well, I live in a house just like everyone else. No, Ellen, not your house. Let's get someone to come pick you up after school and I'll take care of getting your things from your house. Who do you know to call? Do you have any aunts or uncles, say? I already wore out my welcome. Can I have a word, gentlemen? Okay, hon, it's settled. We've decided what to do with you. Home sweet home, kiddo. What about my daddy? We'll take care of that. Don't you worry, okay? He probably won't miss me for about a month, anyways. Miss Hammond, I presume. This is my husband, Ellen. Roy, say hello to Ellen Hammond. Hello, Ellen Hammond. Hi. Two's company, three's a joy. Come in. Come in, come in, come in, come in. This is the guest room. So here's what's happening. Social Services is going to talk to your dad tomorrow. You know what Social Services is? They take care of folks who need taking care of. Right. Then I'm going to go over to your house with one of them and we're going to get your stuff and bring it over here. You can make a list of anything you especially want any of your stuff, and we'll get it. Well, I could go with you. It'd be lots quicker. No, uh-uh. It'll take some time to work things out but everything's going to be fine, okay? Just... go with the flow. Bathroom's downstairs. So when you're ready why don't you come down and help me fix dinner? What's he doing out there? Drying lettuce. You're not from around here, are you? We're from Connecticut. We always liked the South. So when we finished college we decided to settle down here and have a family. I used to be a flower child. You know what a flower child is? A kid with flowers. Not exactly. Close, though. But now I have to be low-key so I can hold a steady job. Oh, boy, when I was young, kiddo I wanted to save the world. What from? Well... From people like your father. You mean there's more like him? Lots more. Too many. My Aunt Nadine says my daddy was a mistake for a person. Right on, Aunt Nadine. So, you have a birthday coming up. Boy, I forgot. How'd you know? Your school records. I looked it up. What do you have in mind by way of a celebration? What would you do if you was me? Were me. Were me. How about a party? The only girl good enough to invite is Starletta. Starletta wouldn't be a party by herself. We'll find out. Hey, do you like gardening? We have a vegetable garden. I used to help my mama. She liked to work in the garden in the morning when it was cool. She... She would pull up the weeds and put them in little piles along the rows and my job was to pick up the piles and dispose of them. When the beans were grown, ready to pick she'd let me help pick them. She'd give me an example of a good bean to hold up in one hand while I picked with the other. If I wasn't sure about a particular bean if it was at the right stage for picking I could just hold up my example of a good bean and know. It took a long time to pick that way. My Mama always hummed in the garden. That was when I was little. What's a flower child? I didn't have a birthday last year. How come? My mama was too sick. Okay, have a look-see. What am I looking at? You're looking at euglena. It's my favorite. I think it might make a nice name for a girl. Euglena. I might keep it in mind if I ever get a baby girl. I also have diatoms on a slide and one of a paramecium but euglena's my favorite. Come and get it, birthday girl. Thank you, guys. Starletta, hold on. Cake, balloons. Thank you. Bye. Bye, darling. I'm real pleased you looked up my birthday. Me, too. Watch out, you dummy! # The Tennessee Waltz. # Ellen! What in the world? Ellen! Ellen! Ellen Hammond! You better get out here right now! You better get on out here! Ellen, you better get out here right now! You don't want me coming in there. Call the police. You all get back to your desks. Back to your desks right now. Ellen? Do you know this person? He's my daddy. You get your little britches out here right now before I count to three or you're going to rue the day! One... two... Daddy, go home! You're getting everyone in an uproar. Go home. Three! Hey! Hey, I'm counting here! I said three. Get out here! Oh, you're asking for it now. You're asking for it! Hey, I just want my kid out of there. Ain't nobody going to stop me, all right? Mr. Hammond, please. I will get my little baby girl out, all right? Mr. Hammond, please. Please, nothing. That's my baby girl in there. You understand? I'm going to get her out. I can take care of her. Hey! I got money. I got money. I understand, sir... That's a public school. My girl is in a public school. You want some of me?! Want a piece of me?! Oh, my. Get your damned hands off of me! They stole my little girl! She's in for it now. You ain't got the right! They stole my little girl! I'm her father! Hey! They stole my little girl! That's my little girl! Here. You're sure there isn't going to be any problem? That would be very unlikely. I don't want there to be any problems. It would be very unlikely. Who believes it? The authorities... the legal authorities. They generally believe that children should be with their families when it's at all feasible. Well, if we were walking down the street everybody would think we was a family. We think so, too. This is such a bummer. They going to send me back to my daddy? No. Not your daddy. Well, who, then? Your Honor, I just want you to know... I'm not really interested... He has no right to say anything... Would you...? Would you please sit down? They just want to take her... Sir, sit down! They talked mainly above my head and usually, I can jump in and hang on to what people are saying but I felt so dazey in my head that not a word made sense. Then the judge who was up in the box he talked right to me for the first time. Ellen, honey I have grandchildren of my own... six of them, to be exact... and if any solitary one of them was ever in a, in a difficult situation and needed caring in a special way because of that situation I wouldn't hesitate for one minute to clasp him or her to my bosom and cherish and protect him or her. The family is the cornerstone of society and when it begins to crumble we are bound to rush in with mortar and bricks and whatever else there is to hand to shore it up. I know that you're old enough and clever enough to understand and I'll say it again: The family is the cornerstone of society. Do I get a chance to say something? No, you don't. Now, hold it right there, please. But, Judge... Just hold, please. What could she possibly have to say, Judge? This matter has been concluded as far as I can see. Can't we please find out what's on her mind? After all she is the bone of contention here! And I think it's only fair that she gets to put her two cents in. Now you speak right up, honey. All that stuff you've been saying about the family and the cornerstone of society? I heard about that in school but if you don't mind me saying as families you've got us mixed up with a different bunch of folks. Judge... Shh! Ever since my mama died things have been like she used to say sometimes: "Up in the air. " When I asked her what was going to happen about one thing or another, she'd often say "Well, that's up in the air just at this moment. " Well, then, along came Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs and they just pulled me right down from all that floating. Judge, I protest! Mrs. Nelson. Please! I can't figure out why my mama's mama wants me. She don't even like me. I don't even remember her looking at me nice in my whole life though I don't know why. Have we had enough of this? Have we? Mrs. Nelson, justice for all in my court. Please. Justice for all! Plus, it beats me why a person can't live with whoever they like best and who likes them best so I'm just hoping you'll let me. I guess that's all my two cents. Kid's got a mouth on her, ain't she? Honey... Ellen. I surely do appreciate your giving us your side of the story, and you may be even right about a couple of things here and there but the fact of the matter is that when it comes to family blood is blood and the law is the law. When you grow up, you'll understand and I surely hope you'll thank me for it. My ruling stands. This hearing is concluded. That's okay. I'd rather go to reform school or get on a chain gang than go stay with her. So would we. She makes a knot in me just thinking about her face. We'll have visits. I wouldn't count on letting her visit if I was you. Were you. Were you. When does school start again? Well, it just ended and I sure am looking forward to the summer at your house. I asked you when school starts. I do not need the commentary. If I'd have known then all I know about her now I would have jumped out of that big car moving and hightailed it. It's big. Good thing, too. You won't be under my feet every minute of the day. Show her where she's staying. Maybe some of her mama will rub off on her staying in that room. Yes, ma'am. How you doing, Miss Ellen? Remember me? We done met before. I'm Mavis. Taking my mama's clothes. That's me. Come on along, then. This place is heaps fancier than the one you was living in. Does anyone else live here? Just your grandma... till you, now. I ain't much to fill it up. Need a lot more like you to fill up this place. Don't you live here? Lord, no, child. Me and Alvin got our place out back. Who's Alvin? Alvin's my husband. Drives your grandma's car. Here you go. Oh! Used to be your mama's room. You knew my mama? Since she was about like you are now. And this was her bedroom? Sure was. Not a lot of changes, neither. Not since the night she run off. Run off where? To be with your daddy... 'fore he was your daddy of course. Yeah, I know Miss Charlotte good as I know myself. I never knowed nobody sweet like your mama. Smart as a whip, too. She was? Lord, yes. Maybe you're smart like her since you were her little girl. I don't know. Yep, your mama was her mama's favorite of the bunch and you know, the others didn't care for that... not Miss Nadine, Miss Betsy Not even Mr. Robert. Who's he? Mr. Robert? That was your grandma's boy. He passed a long time ago. Throwed off a horse at the age of 16. Between me and you and the fence post I'd say your grandma went peculiar the night Miss Charlotte run off and since she passed... rest her soul... well, I'd call her downright touched your grandma. Don't you go telling her I said that. Lord, child. You look just like your mama. Got them beautiful eyes. Why don't you go wash up a bit then come on down to the kitchen and I'll introduce you to Rosaleen. Rosaleen does the cooking I do the taking care. Reverend, how is your missus? Much better. Thanks for asking. I'm so glad. Good morning, Miss Ellen. Good morning. You go sit down and give this baby to me. Aw... Here we go. We're going to sit down. Yes. We're going to sit down. Things are going to be okay. Stop that. Aw, yeah, girl. You'll be fine. Yes, you are. You're going to be fine. Absolutely, my little honey bun. You'll be having your dinner in here on Sundays. The other days, you'll eat in the kitchen with the help. You hear me? Uh-huh. "Uh-huh"? That's trash talk. Say, "yes, ma'am. " Yes, ma'am. And in case you have it in your mind that you'll be lazing around here like the Queen of Sheba, get it right out. Idle hands do the devil's mischief. Don't you break that. Why aren't you eating? I'm not awful hungry just at present. Oh. I hate picky eaters. We'll need to work you up an appetite. Am I going to be working? Oh, you bet. Am I going to get paid? "Paid"?! You're getting your room and board. Huh! You're a greedy one, aren't you? What will I be working at? She didn't pay me a cent but I kept figuring up how much I was worth by the hour. You being real careful, child. She hasn't broken a thing yet in these couple of weeks. Don't bear thinking about it if she did. Can I make a telephone call? You're not to be calling far. I don't know anybody far. Who you calling, sweetheart? Just a friend of mine. I'd say you better be doing it while your grandmama's not home. I'd say that's the way. Hello? It's me... Ellen. Oh, it's so good to hear your voice. How you doing, sweetie? I was wondering if you want to visit my mama. What do you mean, hon? Well, it would have to be Thursday this one coming. It'll be the first year since she's passed. Thursday is when her mama gets her hair fixed so she won't know. I don't think your grandmother would mind you going to visit your mother, hon. Don't count on it. There ain't much she doesn't mind. Isn't much. Isn't much. Can we get some flowers to put down? There it is, over there. I would have loved to have known your mom. She would have been real fond of you. I'm going to take a little walk. Why don't you hang out here for a while? I think the two of you would have gotten along real good. Maybe you're looking down on me and feeling fairly okay about me being her friend but she ain't anything like you. She could never be my mama like you. But Julia, she'd be my... first second choice if you know what I mean. But don't you worry about me being with your mama. I'm going to manage it one way or another. And like you used to say, "Nothing's forever" Though it does seem like it sometimes. I'm doing okay in school. Don't worry, okay? He's been put away for a long time your trash of a father. Beat a man to death fighting in a tavern. They threw the book at him. As long as they threw away the key after they threw the book. Pass. One, no trump. Pass. That's 700 points for our side. You want to play another? Excuse me, ma'am. There's somebody here to see you. Who? Mr. Rudolph, ma'am. Excuse me, ladies. Hannah? Oh... Oh, thank you. Mm-hmm. What the devil do you want? Our business is concluded. Yes, ma'am. I understand. I just come by to drop something off. What? Uh, something for Ellen. What?! Her... Bill's medal. What are you talking about? The medal he got in 'Nam... Vietnam. Bill was a veteran, you know. And should have come back in a box. Not walking to torment my daughter some more till the day she died. Well, with the house up for sale I've been over there cleaning up some and that's how I come across it... the medal. I thought it'd be nice for Ellen to have it... Her daddy's Purple Heart. Get out of my house. Get out! Y-Yes, ma'am. I'll just leave that right there. That's for you, Ellen. Well, we need to make up. Have another one here. Thank you, honey. I hope nobody's peeked a look at my cards. What in the dickens is that woman doing? She didn't have to do that. # O perfect love # # All human thought transcending # # Lowly, we kneel # # In prayer before thy throne # # That theirs may be # # The love which knows no ending # # Whom thou for-er-more doth join # # In one. # Please be seated. Please listen as I read Chapter four, Verse five... Who's that lady? What lady? That one there with all the kids. What do you care? I was just wondering. She looked like a real special mama. I bet she was the perfect one for all those kids. She was like someone having a nice dream and they turn out to be real. Ma'am? Ma'am? Mavis! Mavis! Don't know what happened, ma'am, but we got her into bed though. Mavis is seeing to her right now. Well, did you call a doctor? Sure did... same doctor was here when she had the flu last winter. Says he's on his way over. She still alive? What's happened? Your mama has suffered a stroke. Shouldn't she be in the hospital? Certainly. Have you made arrangements? She wouldn't let me. Wouldn't let you put her in a hospital? Adamant refusal was her response to my repeated suggestion. Says hospitals are where you die. How bad off is she? It was a relatively mild incident. Can we see her? I've given her a sedative. I'll leave a couple of prescriptions. Fill them as soon as possible. Give them to me. I'll go get them at the drugstore. I'll be back in the morning. Prevail on her to be hospitalized if you can. What a bummer. Well, isn't this a mess? It could have been worse, I guess. I-It didn't kill her. I've heard of people with strokes... they'd rather be dead. Not to mention the people who have to take care of them. The timing's rotten. My trip... New Orleans... I'm leaving Monday. Do you think you might want to think about canceling that, Betsy? Let's see how it goes. He said it was mild. Probably one of us should move in here for a while. Who did you have in mind? What about you? Uh-uh. Well, I'm not doing it. A nurse, then... around the clock. Fine. There's no refund on the airfare. I wonder if she made a will. She'd better have. Maybe you should call the lawyer. You helped him, didn't you? Helped who? What? Your daddy, that lowlife. Helped him how? To kill my Charlotte. I never did. There. You best take better care of me than you did your mama. Can I ask you a question? Like what? Well, I know you hated my daddy. But what about me? Can't you see I'm not like him? All I know is, when I look at your face, I see that trash and everything he did to my Charlotte. But I didn't do anything. You set up there in that house like the world owed you a living and you left her to die. Then someone comes to my house and tells me that they found you all laid up next to her like a little idiot. That lowlife never got what was coming to him but I swear... you will never stop paying for your part. Heigh-ho. I've got you now. Sometimes I was scared that she was right about me not taking better care of my mama. So I tried the best I could to take of her figuring maybe Jesus would give me a break when it came my time to pass. Aunt Nadine? This is Ellen. She's passed. Well, at least you didn't die and lay up in the house all alone no one to hear you stop breathing. I think everyone should have someone there to know when they stop being alive. So here I am. You'll look nice when they come, pretty as a picture. I don't want a soul to say that I didn't do my part... to the fullest. Later on I reminded Jesus that I did lots better for my grandma than I did for my mama. I hoped he'd give that some thought and help me find somebody good who could love me. If you do I'll run away! Now calm down, honeypie. Calm yourself down. How could you do that to me? Well, because somebody has to. I hate her! Oh, now listen... I'm not too crazy about her myself. Oh, but if there was any other solution I'd jump at it, believe you me. But the judge says we have to take her... and we're stuck with it, baby. I think that room's going to do you fine... don't you, Ellen? Uh-huh. Though I'm getting real weary of packing and unpacking my stuff in so many places. Is that bag everything you have? All my worldly possessions. Just stay out of my room, is all. Well, why shouldn't I? We have to pick you up a few more things... some clothes. Would you like that? I'm growing out of stuff. Maybe some of Dora's dresses might fit you that she doesn't wear anymore. She's not wearing my clothes. Well, there's some things that you don't wear anymore, pumpkin. I don't care if I wear them or not. She's not wearing any of my clothes. Well, who wants to wear your old clothes anyways? Girls, girls. We'll go shopping next week. You'll need new things for school anyway which, need I remind you starts again the week after next. Who wants to be reminded of that? Well, I kind of favor school. You would. Smarty-pants. Well, you could turn me loose in the store with some money and I could get exactly what I have to have. We'll see. Come and get it. Is that my imagination or are your hands shaking the teensiest little bit? They've been doing that now and again of late. Wonder what that could be? Are you feeling nervy? Could you please pass me the bread? Stay out of my room. How many doughnuts did it take? You got new jeans. They're cool. Where you at now? At my Aunt Nadine's. She's Sora Banning's mother. She stay there, too? Certainly. It's her house. Poor you. She told me to stay out of her room... so I went right in the first chance I got when they were gone. I rambled through that room top to bottom. Romance books in the back of her underwear drawer. You name it. She ain't got a secret from me. Her mama would be shocked at the stuff I came across. Hi. Hi. Isn't the first day of school just about the worst day of the year? You can say that again. How you doing, Starletta? How are you, Miss Hobbs? I'm very well, thank you. Ellen, stay after class for sec, okay? Okay. ll right. So then what did he say? Honey, you don't want to know. We're talking nightmare. Okay, everybody, smocks in the basket. Don't forget to bring in autumn leaves tomorrow. Ellen, I'll see you after school, okay? Bye. So, Que pasa? What? It's Spanish. It means "What's happening?" What's happening... Que pasa? Okay. How's it going? Well, Dora hates my guts. What's your Aunt Nadine like? She wouldn't be anyone's first pick for a mama if you had your pick. She got me some new clothes. This is new. Cool. Ugh. Um... I found the most beautiful dress I ever saw. And it was just with the ordinary dresses and I said, "This is the dress for me. " And the price was right. And it's like... it's just the kind of dress you catch someone's eye with. And when I put it on and I looked in the mirror I just said "Lord, I could just fall right in love with myself. " I have something to tell you. Roy and I are going away. Well, where to? Atlanta, Georgia. An old friend of ours from college has a terrific job for Roy. So, we're going to go. And we're going to have a baby. You are? Yeah. Around next spring. Well, if it's a girl baby, Euglena's a good name. We'll put it on the list. I wish you weren't going. We'll write to you. Will you write back? Boy, are we going to miss you. Thanks for wanting to keep me that time. You're a keeper. Hello, Mrs. Abigail. Hello, Reverend. Do you know that lady? What lady? Her with all the girls. It's a foster family. A foster family? Mama says she'll take in anything from crippled orphans to stray cats. Oldest girl has a baby out of wedlock. Take them in where? In her house, stupid. You know where she lives? In a big blue house by the school the little kids go to. Why? Just wondering. I'm trying to figure out how to get a new mama. Can't get a new mama. Only got one mama and your one's dead. I think maybe you can get a new one if you figure it out right. I was a bit confused. Then I figured out the way it must be. It must be that the foster family lived in it but somebody named Montford owned it. And then I knew I'd got it right. Hi. Are you looking for somebody, darlin'? No, ma'am. Just riding around hither and yon. You see what I mean? It's most curious. When did this start? Last week sometime. She does it on everything she turns in. Have you asked her about it? No. I try to be careful about her. She's had a hard time, this child. Her family dying off right and left. You know, I never once seen her smile. How has she progressed socially since last term, would you say? Same as ever, as far as I can tell. The only child she seems at all close to is that colored girl, Starletta Douglas. Emotionally isolated... insecure as to her social skills... traumatic home environment. You're the doctor. So how are you today, Ellen? Fine. I understand from Mrs. Cudahy and some of your other teachers that you still don't seem to be making any progress in the social way. I don't want to be social. I might after I get my own business straight. What business is that? Personal stuff. I think he liked it when I wasn't too friendly... because if everyone was friendly and sweet he wouldn't have a job. I understand from your teachers that you've taken to signing your papers differently. Did you realize that? Well, sure I realized it. You've been signing "Foster" as your last name. You do realize that? Well, I guess I know my last name, all right. Uh-huh, okay... Then tell me your name. Ellen Foster. But that isn't your last name. Your name is Hammond. Hmm? Ellen Hammond. Would you like to talk about it? About what? About why you're using that name. You see, Ellen... sometimes children such as yourself who've experienced a high degree of distress tend to have identity problems. It's not uncommon for such a child to pretend he's... She's somebody else, you see? So what matters is that you open up and talk to me. Get that pain out of Ellen Hammond and she won't have to be Ellen Foster. Hmm? Tell me what you're thinking. It's okay. It may not be the name God or my mama gave me but that's my name now. My old family kind of wore the other one out. And I figured I could start practicing my new name of my new family for when they are my new family. Foster. It's a clean, fresh name. I notice your hands are trembling a bit. Are you frightened, Ellen? No. I used to be scared but I'm getting to be not so scared anymore. See, Ellen, the problem isn't in the name. The problem is why you think you need a new name. Well, I just told you. You're the one who's mixed up. Well, why don't we discuss it some more next week. I don't plan on discussing anything with you next week or any other time. Excuse me. So long. Oh, yes! Sweet pumpkin, that's a perfect place for that one. It's pulling down the branch? So what? Ellen, what would you like for Christmas by way of a present? Well, you already got me all that stuff and clothes and all. But it's Christmas! Everybody in this house gets a present don't they, pumpkin? Well, I could use a handypack of white paper. Oh! Writing paper? No. The painting kind? I only got four sheets left. Is that all? It's all I can think of right now. Oh. How you doing with that tinsel, sweetie? Good. Oh! It's sweet. Perfect. All that mattered was that this time would be different from last year. And what with Christmas spirit I figure maybe they'll both get to like me after all... though you have to be careful with dreaming like that especially with people you don't know good. I'm going to make them a present. What you going to make? I'm going to make them a picture for them to hang on the wall. Miss Hobbs always said you were real good at picture painting. It has to be a picture of something friendly they'd like. Maybe some cats or a bunch of flowers. I don't think they'd care for one of my experiment pictures or a brooding ocean. A what? Well, that's where the ocean looks real strong and beautiful and sad all at the same time. They wouldn't like it 'cause it looks so evil when you first look at it. They would miss the point. I paint a lot of brooding oceans. And I can paint cats a heap easier than brooding oceans anyways. So, they get fuzzy cats. King me. Let me see how you're doing there, sweetie. Oh, you're the Christmas angel. Look how perfect that is. Um, I want to give you my present tonight instead of waiting for tomorrow, okay? Oh! Well, that'd be very nice, Ellen. You bet. So, what do you think? Uh... Well, Ellen, that's really nice. Did you trace it? No, I didn't trace it. I painted it my own self for you and your mama to hang anywhere you see fit. Why, it's awful sweet of you, honey. We'll hang that up first thing in the morning. What's wrong with right now? Well, that picture needs a frame, honey. A picture as pretty as that calls for a nice frame. I already got some nice frames I made out of colored paper. You can pick the one you like best. We can assemble the whole business tonight. We going to put some old tacky paper frame on our wall? Oh, Dora, be nice. This is so cute! It's not supposed to be cute. She's lying, Mama. I bet she traced those cats. No, I did not trace them. I painted them my own self and you're just too stupid and selfish and fat to appreciate a present made special for you instead of spending a fortune on something out of the store! How dare you speak to my Dora in that manner! You need a good spanking. Touch me, I'll kill you. I had enough getting beat up from my own daddy. Don't you dare kill my Mama! You killed your own mama and my grandma. I want you out of here. Do you hear me?! I didn't want you to begin with and neither did Betsy; nobody wants you. I'll call that judge first thing in the morning right in his own home, Christmas or no Christmas and get you out of my house. Mama, there's butter in my hair. Oh, baby, I'm so sorry. You won't have to be calling any judges. # Joy to the world! # # The Lord has come # # Let earth receive her king # # Let every heart prepare him room... # Hi, pookie... hi... # And heaven and nature sing # # And heaven and heaven and nature sing # # Joy to the world! # # The Savior reigns # # Let men their songs employ # # While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains # # Repeat the sounding joy... # Yes? Is Mrs. Foster home? You must have the wrong house. Nobody named Foster lives here. Isn't this the Foster family house? Oh, well, yeah, we're the foster family but her name is Montford. It says it right on the mailbox. Didn't you see the mailbox? I guess I had it figured out wrong. Is she home? What's this? Somebody looking for you. # What child is this... # Are you looking for me? Why don't you come on in out of the cold for starters? What's your name? Ellen. Are you lost, honey? No, ma'am. And you're looking for me? Mm-hmm. You look a bit familiar. Have I seen you someplace before? Maybe at church. And I was outside your house one time. Yes, now I remember. Well, why don't you take your coat off and tell me what's happening? "Que pasa?" Who taught you that? A friend of mine. Oh, my, what a pretty dress! I wanted to look good. You like hot chocolate? I'm very fond of hot chocolate. My mama used to say that hot chocolate's one of the most comforting things in life... on-on a cold day. Tell me, honey, have you run away from home? No, but I need a place to stay. What do you think about me staying here? Are you sure you didn't run away? I bet your mama and daddy are pretty worried about you right now. My mama's dead and my daddy's in jail and I've been thrown out of my aunt's house. She showed me the door. I see. And how did you know to come here? I seen you in church, you and your girls and I asked Dora who you were and she told me... that's my cousin... and I figured since you already got some girls my size you might be able to squeeze me in, too. I see. Well, I usually have children referred to me by the court. I never had a situation like this. Well, I got something to help you make up your mind. Really? It's $166 there. You can count it. I saved it up from when before my daddy was in jail. Various sources here and there. Julia and Roy gave me an allowance. They've gone off now. They're friends of mine. I want to pay you this money so we can keep this all on the up and up. That way, you and me can be even. You get the money and I can stay here till I graduate from high school. How does that sound to you? Look, you put this back in your pocket. No deal, huh? Tell you what I'm going to do. I have to get lots more information about this situation and first thing in the morning I'm going to call County Social Services and see if we can't get the ball rolling. I can't promise you anything. That's okay. I'm used to it. It's okay, honey. You're safe here. Nobody else put up a fight to get me. Surprise, surprise. There've been more than plenty of days when my new mama has put my hands in hers and said if we relax and breathe slow together I could slow down shaking. And it always works. Every day, I try to feel a little better about all that went on when I was little. I will eventually get it straightened out in my head. I came a long way to get here. That will always amaze me.
