I don't know I'm not sure I have to think about it Perhaps we should wait for the other parachutists to arrive No We can't take the risk We have to do it the day he leaves for Berlin It might be the only chance we get Have you thought what they will do if you succeed in killing him? We have our orders People who gave you those orders are safe in London They don't have to suffer what that are priceless Think what they will do to this country The world would come down on our heads It's a chance we have to take My God they send us children Do you imagine we didn't think about assassinating Heydrich?

Something we've been thinking about for some time He rises at 7 AM Breakfast, bathes and he's dressed by his vallet 7:45 precisely, he usually says goodbye to his daughter, gets into his Mercedez, which is driven by a Chauffeur Glen When the car proceeds down the drive he's escorted by armed troop carrier one jeep and an armered car The convoy traveles very slowly at about 40 miles per hour The first part of the journey is through the country side Tree lined roads and small villages, along order of specially constructed to take him into Prague He enters the out skirt of the Prague at this point here Proceeds around the bended Vulsavitcha junction And then enters Harry Channy castle at 8:05 AM precisely And he's been doing the samething every day without fail It never varies What do you think Jan? There's only one place Here We kill him there as he comes around Vulsavitcha junction But he's heavily guarded all the time He slows down You are gonna stand there? Pointing your guns a few feet from Heydrich, in full view of his escort? We'll never get away with it It's the only place It's suicide Run! Alright, you two! Pick him up, put him in the back of the bakers land Come on! Be careful Easy, easy Vlavika hospital quickly I said it was impossible we should never even have tried It's on the radio he's still alive They are offering reward of ten million crowns It jammed I had him!

The furior's own sergeons are comming Keep him alive untill then But if blood poisoning sets in? Oh father of mercy We pray to thee for thy servant Reinhard Heydrich We remember now who lord his qualities of his leadership his sense of service the inspiration he has been to all the people And we pray that he may long continue to lead to serve and to inspire Amen It is only these two?

We'll give him... 12 hours? Now state secretary Frank salutes He has vowed to root out the criminals who are responsible for this crime Anyone who assisted them or fail to give information will be executed They and their families until justice is done Now it is the turn of proud Heydrich Her face failed to kneel and kiss the flag She steps back as the six officers take up their positions either side of the gun carriage The coffin is raised the command is given Escort comes to attention and the sad prosecution makes its way towards the train Karel I never lost you for anything have I? Don't go now please? No I wouldn't I won't ever leave you Where he would be laid to rest in presence of the furior Liditz Liditz? When he came from the office of the acting rights protector In the course of the search for the murderers of Heydrich it was found that the population of village of Liditz approximately 20 kilometers northwest of Prague had helped and cooperated with the perpetraters of this crime Accordingly a detachment of SS division Prikcks Barugie commanded by SS Overstune Van Furior Max Roshnov was dispatched for Liditz at dawn All the man have been shot, women deported to concentration camps, the children sent to appropriate houses for re-education All the buildings of this village have been destroyed and the name of the village removed from the land register The village of Liditz has seized to exist And it's name will never again appear on any map Come I'll take you to the others Father, I want to confess I confess father to murder Mass murder The people of Liditz I am responsible How were you responsible? I killed Heydrich What happened to Liditz is because of that You are wrong By that crackening, I am just as responsible Simply for harboring you here No, but at war... War is the greatest evil In war, no man could hold himself responsible for the sins of his enemy But Father I can't help I feel it I'll give you a penance if it's penance you want Anything father anything Learn to forgive your enemy Pray for them Jan Pray for them and for the souls of the departed I forgive you in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost, Amen Hi, Josef Hello - Hello, Josef - Hi Isn't Curda with you?
