All passengers holding tickets for flight 1 243... may now proceed to gate 50-B.. Come on. Put me in with the cargo. Sir, the 10:00 to Costa Rica is booked, but I can get you out in the morning. Not if I'm dead, you can't. Thankyou for nothing. Hey, watch it. Who does he think he is, somebody important?. - Sir, you forgot your keys. - Keep 'em. I need a vacation... real bad. Hey, watch it! I hope you're happy. Sir?. I think it's time you came back to work, Dr. Dopler. Hey, Zak! Let's take a look at another example. Say Amy is out for a leisurely drive in her VW bug... and along comes Eddie in his Ferrari. Hey, come on, that could happen. Totally. So, you're doing 20. Eddie's doing 220. -What does he look like when he goes by?. -I don't know.Just a blur, I guess. Exactly. And if he was going fast enough, you wouldn't see him at all. From Eddie's point ofview, you would look as ifyou were standing still. And that is a basic example... of Einstein's theory ofwhat, Eddie?. Highway safety. Relativity. Relativity. - Didn't do your reading assignment?. - That's a funny story. See, science is a discipline. This department has trained some of the best minds in the world. But nobody ever gets there by just coasting along. I don't mean to sound like your father, but I take pride in my students. I want to see them succeed. That means doing the work, being persistent and... not looking for the quick-fix, easy way out. We'll finish up Einstein when I get back from the applied science congress. In the meantime, you guys have a couple days off... to prepare foryour midterm. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, Zak. This is a rare honor. Come on, I visit you at work every now and then. But careful analysis reveals it's usually because you need something. That's crazy. Can you co-sign for my car?. I got the down payment together. There's a few cars I liked at Benson's, and their lot stays open until 9:00. Hold on a second. Hey, Jer. Where's my stipend on the NASA consultation?. - We finished that job three months ago. - Working on it. So maybe we can get there around 7:00?. Dr. Gibbs, your batch is up on the mainframe. It's some pretty wild stuff. - I'll be down in a minute. - What are you working on?. Last weekend an old student sent me a project he's working on with QT Labs. You remember Earl Dopler. One of the best students to ever pass through here. That freak who used to come over and eat a lot of potato salad?. He isn't a freak. Eccentric, maybe. Anyway, the word on this project is very hush-hush. Let's just say that, hypothetically speaking... it were possible to accelerate your molecular structure... until the rest of the world seemed as if it were standing still. - Cool. - It's called hypertime. Imagine being able to perform delicate surgery between the beats of a heart. This technology is going to revolutionize medicine, science, travel. Speaking of travel, a car would be really nice. So, did you download those consumer reports?. I was gonna do that before you got home, but-- -Dad, you already blew me off last week. -No, I was in a meeting with the dean. Of course that's never happened before, right?. I want you to do your homework on this. Let's see those safety reports. - And we'll talk about it at home. - Does that mean we can go tonight?. It means we'll talk about it when I get home. Good enough. Yes! It's very safe and a great father-son activity. Dude, you made all this just by selling junk on your computer?. Well, one man's junk is another man's down payment, Meeker. - Start thinking outside the box, man. - What box?. The box you're in that keeps you from seeing that this $5-an-hour job blows. Dude, I ain't gonna be here forever. Check it out. Bam! Plur 1 02. DJ contest tomorrow night. I'm signed up. "Underground dance par-tay." Yeah, that's very "funk-fliggety" ofyou. Dude, I been practicin'. Sneaked away from the study hall. Worked the turntables in the tech room. - Who is that?. - Hey, dude, where you been?. That's Francesca, the new girl from Venezuela. She goes to our school?. That's gotta be good for attendance. Tell me about it. She has PE when I'm in Marching Band. I get smacked every time the trombones turn to look at her. - This is perfect. - What?. Foreign girl in a foreign land, man. She's all lonely and vulnerable. I read about this in Cosmo. I gotta go talk to her. Oh, no, you're gonna get faced. I'm not gonna get faced, man. Come on. Watch and learn. Okay. You're gonna get faced. Excuse me. Do you have the time?. I mean, you go to my school, right?. I couldn't say. What school is yours?. Jefferson. My friend watches you in PE. I mean... you're new, right?. Yes. Well, I'm Zak... and I thought-- I know it can be kinda lonely when you first move to a new town. I thought maybe you needed somebody to show you around. I see. It's so very hard for me. I try to be brave, exploring the town all by myself, when all I really want... is to be giving my love to the very first bozo who wants to know the time. I read Cosmo too. Right. Okay, well, I'll see you in school then. Okay?. Hey, you did good, man. I think she likes you. Are you watching this?. He was so cute, and now he's all, "I'm a gangsta, yo." Yeah, I was in earlier about the Mustang. You still have it, right?. Cool. I will be there later tonight with the down payment. Okay. Thankyou. - What are you doing?. - This way it's more like homemade. I want us to have a nice dinner tonight before your dad goes to his conference. - He's taking me to buy a car tonight. - After dinner. Mom, can I have some money?. Did you do your chores?. Have I told you lately how much I respect and admire you?. Buy a car, give money to Satan. You're so lucky you're an only child. Hey, Mom says we can go after dinner... which is cool because they're open till 9:00, so we should still make it. - Make what?. - The car lot. They've got a Mustang convertible. I'm gonna trick it out with a V-8. ConsumerReports rated it a best buy-- good reliability, decent gas mileage... and pretty good crash test scores for a convertible. Okay, so what else have you compared it to?. Nothing. That's the car I want. You're not gonna prove your case by ignoring all the other data. It's not a clinical trial, Dad. If something's right, you gotta close your eyes, grit your teeth and hang on. No, you gotta step back, weigh the options and make a calculated choice. I want you to do your homework on this. If the Mustang is the caryou want when I get back, that's the car we'll get. It's not gonna be there when you get back.Just come look at it tonight. When I get back. I gotta go over Dopler's project tonight. - You haven't heard from him in a week. - Yes, but I promised to get to it. That's what this is about, isn't it?. This isn't about looking at other cars. - What are you talking about?. - Nothing! You always have time foryour students and never foryour own kids. Now he's concerned about me. Hey, I asked you to come to this conference. - Who was it who said he was too busy?. - The Congress of Applied Science?. - There's fun for the whole family. - Stop it. Sit! Eat. Kelly, get off the phone. - Okay. - Come on, you guys. Some of history's greatest peace treaties have been signed... over green beans and beef Stroganoff. I'm not hungry. - Zak, I promise I'll take you-- - Tell it to Dopler. I don't know how you work in all this mess. Honey, I was gonna fix that foryou. I bought a new toaster a year ago. Yeah, yeah, I know. I don't wanna leave with something like this between Zak and me either. It's just-- He's got so much potential and, yeah, right now he can skate by... but it's gonna catch up to him. Maybe. But he's finding his own way, George. Just because it isn't your way doesn't mean that he's lost. Okay, let me put this back together and I'll go up and make peace. Okay. Don't forget. You know how you get down here. No, no, I promise. Two minutes, hon. Come in. - Wanna talk about anything before I go?. - No, I'm good. This is... my itinerary... and my hotel, in case you need to get in touch with me. Thanks. Have fun with your science friends. What?. We'll work it out when I get back. Mr. Gates, I don't make policy, but I do enforce it. So they're shutting me down. Hey, you knew it was a black ops contract. The administration found out about it. They want it to go away. Well, you need to make them understand the significance ofwhat we're doing. Look, Gates, I supported you on this as long as I could... but they've got a point. What if one of the Saddams of the world gets his hands on this stuff?. The fact is, he can waltz right through an entire army... plant an A-bomb in the president's bathtub... and all our smart bombs and satellites would be useless to stop him. I'm not even finished building it... and they have me selling it on the black market?. Mr. Gates... the NSA expect your research, your equipment... the whole shooting match crated and ready for pickup on Monday. And if I'm not ready?. We're taking it whetheryou're ready or not. Restricted access requested. Please step forward for retinal scan. Have a nice day, Henry Gates. You all ri ght?. Yes. Why?. - How's he doing?. - Seems okay. But he wrote that a half hour ago. How dramatic. And charming. All right. Bring him down. Hello, Dr. Dopler. How are things in hypertime?. "How are things in hypertime"?. Look at me. I've been in here a week. - It's like I've aged 20 years. - At least 20. Maybe more. Why don't you just kill me now?. I was hoping that wouldn't be necessary. Besides, it's your own fault. Ifyou'd solved the aging glitch in the original design... we wouldn't have had to bring you back to build this. The molecular stabilizer should reverse the aging effects in hypertime... but I'm having a little trouble with the program and-- Earl, the NSAwants all our toys in three days. Well, they're their toys, right?. They don't know the watches workyet, and I don't intend to turn them over. Besides, how can I enjoy the power of hypertime... if every time I use it I end up looking old?. Like you. I want this fixed in 48 hours. Dude, that is impossible. Well, then I guess I will have to kill you. Wait, wait, wait. Maybe I could do it faster. I mean, I'm still waiting on some data from a friend. A friend?. Well, no, I mean-- I can trust this guy. He's on the outside, but he's cool. He's my college professor. If anybody can crack the math on this, it's him. What data did you send him?. Well, actually, I-- I sent him a watch. You idiot! I want that watch back. Mom! Zak's pants knocked over Dad's stuff! Dad was gonna fix this for me so I could sell it. Figures. When your father's old and gray... you're gonna regret not having a better relationship with him. There's plenty of time for that. Where are you guys going?. I made breakfast! Oh, no, that's it. Get off the bike. Hey, "Freaker," you trippin' on some bad lunch meat?. I hearyou signed up for the spin-off tonight. Ditmar, lay off. Yo, yo, yo, I ain't on him, all right?. Listen up here, buddy. Tonight it's just gonna be me and you on stage. You aren't gonna have your little sister backing you up. What was that?. 'Cause all I hear is a crowd going, "Go, Meeker! Go, Meeker!' This guy's hot, man! I need to cool him off! Later, jerk-wad. Let's go. I'm Dit-O. I'm spinning at Underground tonight. Wanna come?. - You won't leave me hanging tonight?. - No, dude, I'll be there. Relax. He probably blows anyway, man. I gotta go do something about this. Oh, what's the matter?. No habla ingles? No, it's so very hard for me. But I try to watch and learn. - Oh, I'm sure you do. - Like this! Later, jerk-wad. All right, make a hole, boys. Yo, I got a hole for ya. That's a perfectly good trash can. Don't be throwing students at it. Come on, both ofyou. You okay?. Yeah, I'm okay. - Move it. - He started it! I don't care who started it. You finished it. I didn't need any help. I wasn't-- I wasn't-- I was looking for my buddy's retainer in the garbage. These band freaks always, you know-- Right. Very nice. Now, ifyou'll excuse me-- Okay, well, since I have you here... I'd just like to apologize for being such a loseryesterday. - Only yesterday?. - No, every day. Hey, I'll apologize for global warming ifyou'll give me another chance. A cup of coffee after school. Come on. I'm sorry, I have plans. - Okay, how about afteryour plans?. - I have more plans. Would it be such a stretch for some ofyour plans to include me?. All right. I guess we all deserve a second chance. Here's my address. The only thing is, I have to baby-sit my brother and sister... but you can come by around 4:00. Okay. Yeah, 4:00. Yeah-- I mean, yeah, that's probably okay, I think. - Okay, so I'll see you then. - Great. I thought maybe we could spend some time by the pool while the sun's still nice. Yeah, works for me. Catch some rays. Great. There's another rake over there. Rake?. Right. Right. When I said "second chance"... I was thinking dinner and a movie or a cup of coffee. I told you I had plans, and you asked if they could include you. I did, didn't I?. - Yes, you did. - Yeah. Look at it this way. You go to a movie, you can't have a conversation. You go out for coffee, there's always a lull. This way when there's a lull, at least my leaves get raked. Yeah, well, are you gonna do the whole thing by hand?. Yeah. My father says it develops self-discipline. That's what people always say when they want you to do stuff for free. I got a better idea. Stop that! Stop! You're supposed to be helping. - Sorry. - Silly. So where did you move after that?. When I was 1 5, we left Caracas to go to London. Just when I was making friends, we got transferred here. Wow, you've lived everywhere. My dad took us to Legoland once. Had the Taj Mahal and the Eiffel Tower. Don't feel bad. At least you have a place to call home. Yeah, I guess, but it must be pretty cool being a consul's daughter. That makes you, like, royalty, doesn't it?. Right. I'm waited on hand and foot. I would like to catch the dog that does this. I was gonna make us iced cappuccinos. Cappuccino?. We don't have to paint the house or wash the car first?. No! Here, here, I'll do that. I'll finish up out here and you start on the caffeine. - Really?. - Yeah. Great. Maybe we'll still have time for a swim. - Yeah?. - What time is it?. I don't know. No, I do. Hold on. It's... 16:57. Whatever that is. Right. I'll be right back. A little coffee, a little swim. That's what I'm talking about. Whoa. Go! Go! Get outta here! You big rat! Come on! Seriously, don't make me kickyour ass. Whoa. Hey, Francesca. I think I found your troublemaker. Whateveryou guys are throwing away, it gave this guy a heart attack. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Oh, boy. Get him out! Help! Get him out! I'm sorry. I am sorry. I swear he was dead. What is wrong with you?. We were having such a good time. - You can't work alone for two seconds! - I was out there for a half hour! Half an hour?. I just walked in here. "Hypertime exposure." That's weird. Maybe you should just go. - We were gonna go swimming. - Swimming?. You want swimming?. I'll give you swimming. No way. No... way. Wow, you have nice skin. This is weird. How did you do that?. I have no idea. Look, I don't know what you're up to, but out you go. Come on, out. Come on. Out. Let's go. Out. Wait, wait. Something weird is going on. - You and your rat, that's what's weird. - No, I'm not trying to freakyou out. I just pushed this button. That's what I'm saying. So... you did this?. I think it was the watch. My dad consults on these super-secret projects... and I think this is one of them. So, your watch stops time?. No. Look. It's moving. Wow. Wow. "QT"?. That's where Dopler works. This must be the thing my dad is helping him with. He said something about it accelerating your molecules so fast... the rest of the world would seem like it was standing still. I don't think time has stopped. I thinkwe're just moving really fast. He said it was theoretical. I had no idea he'd actually built the thing. Look at this. - Why did I speed up and not my brother?. - I don't know. Let's find out. It's about time. Did I leave you in hypertime?. I'm sorry. I guess for this to work we have to be touching each other. Sooner or later all guys say that. Now what?. Well... with such awesome power... comes awesome responsibility. At least that's what my dad would say. But he's not here, is he?. Where do we start?. There's that woman who's always giving me parking tickets. Look at her. She writes them before the meter even expires. She has offended my sense of justice. Needs something more. Yeah. Whoa, perfect. Come on. Looks like we got our own little Picasso here. Well, he's about to enter his blue period. Nice nose ring. That's Meeker's bike he's stealing. Oh, I don't believe this. This guy promised me that he'd hold this car for 24 hours. Well, it's just not right to break a promise. Shall we?. Make it so, Number One. - What?. We have Star Trek in Venezuela. - Do it. Dude, wait up! Don't leave me like this! Help! All right?. DJ Swamp! What's the deal, DJ?. Come on! All right?. The people have decided, baby! DJ Swamp is the winner of this round! Let's keep this thing goin'! Let's get to our next two DJs! First up, we got DJ Dit-O! Boo! We also got DJ Meeker! - Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! - Where is he?. All right, Dit-O, it's your time to shine, baby! Let's do this! Yeah! What's up, Meek?. Are you ready?. You suck! That's weak! He really is not very smooth, is he?. No way! I can't take this anymore. He needs so much help. Here, stand him up first. Okay. What are we doing?. A little dance lesson. First off, let's give him a little attitude. Get one arm while I grab the other and pull him. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! This is wrong. This is absolutely wrong. No, it's Swan Lake. Go, Meeker! Go, Meeker! Go, Meeker! - How's your head?. - I thought I was gonna wet my pants! - How's your head?. - I thought I was gonna wet my pants! This hypertime thing is so trippy. I knew it wasn't me doing the moving, but I couldn't feel you guys moving me. Actually, I thinkyour boy Dit-O did wet his pants. Zak, your watch is off the hook! What we gonna do next?. Hey, let's dress Coach Wells up like Britney Spears. Oh, man! Why not?. - Didn't you say you have to get home?. - Hey, forget that. Forget that! Leslie Miller has a slumber party tonight. You know she got that pool, and the girls get naked. Or we could go to Vegas! Go to Vegas! Genius, hey! We're not going anywhere. My dad finds out I took the watch, I'm gonna be grounded forever. So-- Man! It's right up here. You gotta be kidding me. Oh, all right, fine. I can take a hint. You sure you don't want me to come with you?. I got this plan-- Okay, man! See you Monday, Meeker. - Good night. - Yeah, okay. Y'all have fun makin' out. Watch this. Oh, yeah, that's funny, Zak. That's real funny. You're abusing your powers! I'm gonna call the Super Friends on you! Oh, it's on now! I'm gonna get you for this! - So-- - So-- That didn't turn out so bad after all, Mr. Second Chance Man. Yeah, well, the way I figure it... ifyou make a bad first impression, things can only get better from there. Right, and you take the prize on both counts. I'd better go. - Now?. - Yeah?. At midnight my father blinks the porch light... and I turn back into a pumpkin. Yeah, I should probably go too. Although midnight could be a pretty long time off. Stop that. What, do you think that magic watch is gonna get you a kiss?. I just wanted to spend more time with you. You don't need magic. What?. I wanted to kiss you. Sweet dreams, Mr. Second Chance Man. I had fun. Shut up! Shut up! Who are you?. What do you people want?. - Duh! They want to kill you, man. - Why?. What did I do?. Because you showed up, and you've got something that's not supposed to exist. Now grab those wires under the dash. Go, go, go, go! Okay, now bite the green one. Okay, that's not it. Okay, strip the red wire with your teeth and touch it to the steering column. Come on! Hurry up, man! Just bite it! Okay, go. Hurry, man, they're coming! Go! Come on! You're gonna have to drive! Go, go, go! - He's in the van! - Come on! Whoa, man! You are gonna get us killed. - This is not as easy as it looks. - Yeah, I know, but-- Whoa! - Who are those guys?. - You don't want to know. - What were they shooting at me?. - Liquid nitrogen. It's a quick and dirty comedown from hypertime. The cold slows your molecular activity. Probably faster to gnaw off my hand. So, is it me or are they trying to kill you too?. Yeah, they're probably up for a two-fer at this point. Hang on! All right. Whoa. - Give me the watch. - No! - Give me the watch! - Or what?. You'll adjust me to death?. "Adjust me to death." That's great. Give me the watch! - You crazy lunatic! - "Crazy lunatic"?. That's redundant. Give me that! Come on! Hey, dude! Whateveryou do, don't get it wet! So strange. Seems fine... although his vitals are elevated. Oh, here he comes. How you doing, Sleeping Beauty?. You okay?. You all right?. - Where'd you get the van, kid?. - Not now. Let him breathe. - Mom. - Zak! Is he okay?. He'll be fine. It was just a mild concussion. - How you feeling?. - Okay, I think. - Good. So you can stand trial. - What?. Hello! You stole a van and crashed it. Can I have his room while he's in jail?. Please?. - You almost got killed on that joyride. - Honey, you had us so worried. I don't know what got into him. He's a good kid. Really. Cool! This doesn't have to go on his record, does it?. No, you don't understand. I was in hypertime with these guys, and they were after my watch. It's a molecular accelerator. Here. Oh, man. It's broken. - They're gonna kill me. - Who?. - These guys! They were in our house. - What?. You couldn't see 'em. They were invisible. - Oh, yeah, right. - Here you go, sir. I said creamer, you twit. - Is he gonna be okay?. - I can't stay here. Nurse. Thankyou. Oh, crap. Come here. - Oh, he's so faking it. - Yeah. Yeah. I am faking it. I'm sorry I stole the van. I would love to tell you all about it, but first I have to pee. Come on, come on. What are you doing?. I can't go unless there's some noise. Come on. - Get some coffee. - Let's go! I don't want to hear any excuses. Just get back here. I've got something I want delivered to our contact at the FBI. A little publicity should help flush out Dopler and the kid. Because we can't kill what we can't find. But without Dopler, how do you finish the molecular stabilizer?. Who needs the student... when the teacher is so close at hand?. Hot Skates. Junior Associate Meeker speaking. I need to borrowyour mom's car. What's going on?. The cops are looking for you. Just turn around slowly. B.e cool. You don't want to be seen with me right now. Okay, go home and get the keys to your mom's Subaru. What?. Are you crazy?. Somebody is trying to kill me over this watch, and it doesn't even work now. Okay, dude, but you don't need a Subaru. What you need is the police. I just came from the police. Look at me. They weren't as helpful as you'd think. I need to go to Kingston to find my dad. He might know who these people are. Dude, that's a six-hour drive, man. I gotta go. Budget cuts. Okay, Mr. Invisible, where are you?. That's nice. What are you doing in there?. Did you break into my house just to pee?. No, actually... to use the phone too. What are you wearing?. I know this sounds weird... and it's the last thing you want to hear from a guy after one date, but... the cops are looking for me everywhere and I've got no place else to go. I need to borrow some clothes and money for a bus. I promise I'll pay you back. - Okay?. - You are freaking me out. - What is going on?. - It's a long story. The less you know, the better. Things with the watch have gotten really twisted. I gotta get to Kingston and find my dad, because they could be after him too. Who is after who?. What is happening?. I don't know who they are. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here. Wait. Slow down. Come over here and just relax. I'm glad that you came. I am. But ifwe're gonna be friends, you have to tell me what is happening. I told my brother I was getting the car washed, so bring it back clean. Okay. I can't thankyou enough. - Call me when you find him?. - Yeah. What are you doing?. You raked my leaves. I can't let you go alone. He's been calling all day. This is the first chance I've had to check my messages. George, listen, calm down. The police want you to stay there in case Zak calls again. If he shows up here I'll let you know. If he's giving you any trouble, I can talk to him. Fine. I just feel helpless, sitting here waiting. Welcome to the club! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I've been everywhere trying to track him down, and we couldn't reach you. All right, let's go overyour list. Hi. I need the room number for Dr. George Gibbs. He's here with the convention. And you are?. In a hurry. Yeah. Let me see what I can do. I never should have left with something like this between us. - Did he try to explain his behavior?. - Not really. I mean, he rambled on a bit when he came to, but-- Oh, wait. He said something about his watch being a molecular accelerator or something. Molecular accelerator?. Downstairs, on the shelf above my desk, there's a box with a watch in it. - See if it's still there, will you?. - What's going on?. Just check the box, okay?. Just a minute. - Are we there?. - Yeah. You know, I usually don't like to meet a boy's father this soon... but for you-- Do you think while we're there you can tell him taking the watch was your idea?. - Dr. Gibbs?. - Yeah. My name is Henry Gates. I'm with QT Laboratories. I believe we have a mutual friend, Earl Dopler. - He tells me you're an expert on-- - Whatever this is about... it's gonna have to wait, 'cause I'm in the middle of something very important. You certainly are. Dad?. No payments for 12 months. Don't wait. The fire we reported at the old fire hall... - is still burning out of control. - Front desk. - How may I help you, Dr. Gibbs?. - Hi. - Did I check out yet?. - Not that I know of, sir. Did I change rooms?. No. Dr. Gibbs, is everything all right?. And in othernews, it seemed like a simplejoyride in a stolen van... until the FB.I linked the teenage suspect to the theft... oftop-secret government research by this man-- Dr. Earl Dopler of QT Laboratories. That's not Dopler. Dopler is one of my dad's students. - He's a hippie with long hair. - Dr. Dopler is considered... armed and extremely dangerous. Well, at least they didn't mention your name. Ifyou should see him or Zak Gibbs... please contact your local police department-- Okay. Okay. I'm officially freaked out now. We can call my dad. He knows people from the consulate. - I know he can help. - I'm not putting your family at risk. It's bad enough I got you involved. Hey, macho man, I got me involved. But maybe I should just call them to let them know I'm okay. What's this yo-yo doing?. Hey! You're blocking us in! What's he doing?. Let me out of here! Help! Are you okay?. You know, the first date was nice. This one, not so much. What was that?. I don't know. Just stay cool. Hi. How are you?. Ready to give me that watch?. All right, that's fine. You know what I don't like?. Gettin' kicked in the head! That is subpar. - I didn't know you knew karate. - I don't. That was ballet. Next time, kick harder! Up, up, up. All right, little dude... hand it over. And don't even think about touching that dial. Okay, okay. What did you do with my dad?. - I know you're a spy. It's on the news. - That's not true. I love my country. Now, give me the watch so I can go to Costa Rica. And no funny business, okay?. Or your hottie here gets it. Okay, okay. Okay, here. First chance I get, I'm kicking you right between the eyes. That's it. Come to Papa. I am so out of here. - Dude, you got it wet. - It's actually not-- Limber. Bravo. All right, ifyou're Dopler, then prove it. Your mom's name is Jenny. Your sister is Kelly. You were born in May. What else do you wanna know?. This is messed up, Dopler. - This is really messed up. - How do you think I feel?. I think he's lying. Do you want me to kick him again?. Yeah, all right. If the watch makes you age, then how come we haven't gotten older?. - You weren't in hypertime long enough. - What makes you think... that Gates has my dad locked up in hypertime?. Because they took him to replace me. And there's no other way to finish the molecular stabilizer... before the feds shut him down. Look, Zak, I'm sorry, okay?. This is freaking me out too. But your dad taught me everything I know. I mean, your dad is like a father to me. Right. Which is why you're in such a hurry to get to Costa Rica. Hey, no fair. When I sent your dad the watch... I had no idea that Gates was gonna bogart everything from the feds. There's gotta be something we can do to get him out of there, right?. - "We"?. - Yeah, we. Since you and my dad are so close, I thought maybe you'd like to help. Well-- I mean, I didn't say that we were that close. Oh. Okay. Fine. Then I can drop you off at QT. I'm sure Gates would love to have you back. Now, can you fix this?. Yeah. But we're gonna need some stuff you can't get at Radio Shack. You heard the man. Let's go shopping. Hey there. Day passes for the expo hall are $1 4, please. I don't have any money. Do you?. You can't ask your hostage for money. - Hi. - Hello. - How are you?. - Good. How are you doing?. - Actually, I need some help, okay?. - Hi. - Let me askyou something. - What can we do foryou?. - What is this, exactly?. - That is an airbrush gun. Airbrush gun. Wow. - You're into precision items, huh?. - Yeah. - Yeah?. - Cool. - What does this do?. - It's for airbrushing cars and walls. - Painting. - Very cute. What is that over there?. That's an industrial-strength hot-glue gun. - Hot-glue gun. Wow. - It's a hot seller. Well, Dexter, you guys have been both so helpful. - Thankyou very much. - Thankyou. - Bye. - See ya. - Mama. - Don't get many of those. All right. We just need someplace quiet to go to work for a while. While you're at it, can you make that thing go any faster?. What is it with you wacky kids today?. It's like nothing's ever fast enough. Oh, great. We're out of gas. - I guess I'm gonna have to go get-- - I'll get it. Keep an eye on him?. He's amazing, isn't he?. Do you know him?. Yeah, I've seen him around. The side entrance is too obvious. We'll never get in that way. - I still can't believe he drew this. - Sorry it's so rough. I didn't have my protractor. Okay. There's gotta be another entrance. Let's just step back and look at our options. You're starting to sound like your dad. "Let's step back, look at our options." Shut up. I'm nothing like him. Oh, come on. I meant it as a compliment. You don't have to blow your RAM. Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. What's this?. What's under here?. Is that like a sewer?. - Ventilation, but close. - Can we get in that way?. Sure, ifyou don't mind getting Ginsu-ed by the intake fan. - Give me the new watch. - Here. There we go. And-- Now, check this out. All that technology... incognito. Huh?. Let me do that like that. - And I'll take that. Thankyou. - Fine. You don't even give a dude time to admire his work. It's unbelievable. What are you doing?. I can sell that on eBay. Zak, come in through the back door. I came as soon as I could after you called. Come on. Hey, Meeker, you the man. How's this gonna work again?. Gates is gonna have guards in hypertime. We're gonna need to bring 'em down to real time. These babies ought to do it. You take the paint out... I put the frozen nitrogen in... and voila. N2O to go. Come on, come on, come on. All right. This is it. Just past here are the ducts into the building. Let's go. Come on, Earl. Here's the map. This is as far as I go. - We had a deal. - Look, man, I'm scared. Okay?. Ifyou went through what I've been through... this place would give you the willies too. I can't go in there, Zak man. - He was like a father to you, right?. - Hey, that's low. And ifyou hadn't taken the watch to begin with, he wouldn't be in there. What are you talking about?. You put my whole family at risk... when you sent him that watch. "Oh, I didn't know it was a weapon, man. I thought it was for science, dude-man, Zak man." - That's the truth. - The truth is that man in there... gave his life to students like you. He treated you like a son. Now he needs something and it's too much foryou?. You know what?. I am his son, and I'm going in there. Unauthorized hypertime. Unauthorized hypertime. Hypertime security response required on level three. Come on! Manson, check security levels four and five. Anderson, check the stairs. I can hold these guys off. Go get your dad. Security breach, level four. I'll see you at the fan in five minutes. Seal offall exit terminals. You, freeze! Get off that bike! Unauthorized hypertime, storage level three. Have a nice day, Ralph Sekada. Thanks, Ralph. Hello, Zachary. I really want to thank you for bringing this back. Let's go down to real time. Dad?. Dad! He's down here. We're just about to find out whether he's as brilliant... as everyone says that he is. He must be very fond ofyou. I couldn't get him to do a damn thing until I threatened to kill you. Dad. You okay?. - You swore you'd leave him out of this. - Don't blame me. He's here on his own. Maybe you forgot to give him his allowance. - You came here?. - What was I supposed to do?. Oh, Zak, no, no. I was only cooperating with them so that they'd leave you alone. - I couldn't leave you here to die. - So you had to come join me?. - What?. - Oh, Zak. You're always saying that I only show up when I need something. Now I'm trying to help you, you don't even appreciate it?. Putting your life in the hands of terrorists is not what I had in mind. What is it with you?. It's a good thing I'm your son instead of one ofyour precious students. - Then you'd be really disappointed. - What are you talking about?. Would you two just stop it?. Sheesh. You really are a lot alike. Who's your friend?. Francesca. From school. No wonderyou wanted a car. Restricted access requested at northwest wing. - What is it?. - Agent Moore, sir. Happy Monday, Mr. Gates. Do you have some things for me? I'm sorry for the inconvenience... but I'm gonna have to ask you to come back. This isn't the prom, Gates. The agency is serious about this. Why don't you do us both a favor and drop the games?. You can't come in. Gentlemen, start your engines. Yes! We're gonna get out of here. Everything's gonna be okay. I wouldn't be so sure. Change of plans, people. We're gonna test the molecular stabilizer... while we're actually in hypertime. Warning. Clean room hypertime engaged. - What's happening?. - He's taking us all into hypertime. Three minutes and counting! Once he's finished with that thing, he's not gonna need us anymore. They're gonna kill us, aren't they?. There's got to be another way out of here. Zak, this place is sealed tight as a drum. What's this?. They've been experimenting with hydrogen. Hydrogen. They turn them on from tanks out there in the lab. But-- Zak?. Zak, you're gonna blow us up. - Not us. Them. - Zak. Zak, stop! Come on! Let us out! I'm sorry for being so caught up in my work. It was never because I care more about my students. Sir, we got a problem. We can't get in. The access code to the molecular stabilizer has been changed. Very clever, Dr. Gibbs. You changed the access code. B.ut I thought we had an agreement. I let your son live ifyou cooperate. Well, it's time to renegotiate. He and the girl go free, then you get your access code. Fine. Get those kids out of there, then bring that old man to me. Zak, what are you doing?. Finishing what I came here to do. Come here. - Gates tookyour watch. - Gates took a watch. He'd probably get $1 0 for it on eBay. I switched them in the elevator. Zak, you can't accelerate when you're already in hypertime. - It could kill you. - We don't have a choice. - No, Zak! - We don't have any choice. Unbelievable. Your molecules are moving so fast, your hand went right through the table. Are you okay?. I have no idea. Here we go. Sir, we got a problem in there. The kid is doing something freaky. Well, bring him down! You know what to do. Hi. Mr. Gates! Come on. Let's get out of here. Zak. Your plan worked. Let's get out of here. - Say good night, little man. - No! Good night, little man. Yeah. It hurts, doesn't it?. Thankyou. I'll take that, thankyou. So what do you have in mind for our next date?. Dopler, next time you need help with your math homework, don't call me. Dr. G. Did you ever get this little anti-aging gizmo working?. 'Cause I don't wanna stay like this forever. Forget about it. I never got a chance to test it. Oh, thank God you're okay. - What happened?. - It's okay. I'm just a little more distinguished, that's all. Where's Zak?. He'll be here in a minute. He had to make a stop. - What?. - No, no. He's just fine. - Daddy! Daddy! - Oh, honey, it's so good to see you. There he is. Oh, Zak! Oh, thank God you're okay. - You must be Francesca. - Hi. Hey, creepy. Nice ride. I hearyou're a big hero now. Well, I wouldn't say hero, but-- Look, I'm not gonna be nice all day, so enjoy it. - Hey, who's that?. - Actually, honey... there's something I forgot to tell you on the phone. We had a little problem at the lab. I guess we're gonna have some company for a while?. Oh, hey, Mrs. G. How's it hangin'?. - Dopler?. - Hello, gorgeous. Over. Over. More. More. Hit it. Let's see what this thing can do. Yeah! Buckle up! Wait! Wait!
