This is Miss Alice! - Come, I will take you to villa. - Thank you. - Are you still in mourning, Don Vincenzo ? - It's an illusion. If you see someone in mourning, leave them alone. If you have any questions, ask. - You are priceless... - Yout are going to rest well here... How much longer with the luggage? - No change since 1944. - Only we've changed. Do you remember me? Of course, you are the first Russian I ever met in my life. - We go to Serenella Villa. - Let's go ! You can lead a normal life here. If you need something call the tavern, here's the number. I'm owner's daughter godfather. I'll call back immediately. Thank you, Don Vincenzo. I can handle the rest with my son and my wife. I'll be here more relaxed. - I have to send a telegram. - Give me a text, I will send it. No, thank you. I will take this opportunity and shave my beard. See my cousin, Alfio. He's excellent barber. I will be back soon. This arrived for you. It was in an envelope addressed to me. I apologize! I was told that I could receive correspondence that way. I'm at your service. You can trust Don Vincenzo. What a beauty... Wait for me! Ciao, Ciro. Hotel Excelsior, Rome It's an honor... ...that I can shave a real American. - Very good. - Sir... one moment... ... the moisturizer. From selected herbs We do it ourselves, it is famous... Phone call for you ! Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Fred. - Where is the phone? - Over there. - Hello! - Rome on line. - Hello! - Sorry, no one answers. Could you check if this is a number of Rosa Moniconi? One moment, please. Bunico, bring wine and bread ! No answer. Thank you. - How much do I owe you? - Five liras. Thank you. Can I talk to you ? Of course, I confirmed the office in Rome that I'll get there tomorrow. Don Vincenzo... I want to come early tomorrow morning. Do not worry, I will deal with it. Thank you. Forgive me that I came so late! Duccio was very sleepy. Alice said he was a little nervous because their journey. I am excited ! When I saw you without your beard, I felt uneasy. As if everything came back when we first met. When we went back in Italy I felt the same. Where did get this picture ? It was in the book, I haven't seen it before. My God, how different you were ! It's been three years! I remember who was this man. A girl's boyfriend. I was sent there to pay for a box of penicillin. You are also different. When I was in Italy, it was a war... Everything seemed beautiful. - Everything ? - Yes ! - And our love ? - Also. Even our love. Now we are back in Italy. Please ! Mama... Diomira... What mother. Captain! Fred.... Come in ! You seen? I told you that I return to Rome. - Is Rosa home? - Asleep, as always! Come in. Mr. Alfredo, my friend. The captain, was a friend of Rosa, in time of war. She told me about you. Are you still in the army Captain ? Now I work for UNESCO. I am here for artistic values. Take it to Rosa, surprise her. She's in one of those rooms. - Do you remember which way ? - I'll find it with my eyes closed. - With your permission. - A true gentleman! Fred.... ! Fred... honey. Coffee. I came directly from America. I came to you before I did anything else ! You haven't changed, Fred. What do you say, Fred? If you knew how often I thought about you. It's for you. I love you, Fred. I love you. This is amazing. This is beautiful. This is beautiful! I have to do a tour of Tuscany. - Do you want to come with me? - Of course, darling. I am ready! Take it. Buy a suitcase, dress... Anything you need for a few weeks. Buy what you want. If we need something, we can buy it on the road. Dear Ciro, thank you ! When I write to you, I see your face. When I feel that I can not touch it, kiss it. Did you think about me, I feel guilty towards you. It's been more than three years since we saw each other. I remember how little time we spent together. Fuck you... ! - Remember that there are also others. - Wait, I'm already here. Hurry. I think you need a smoke. - Thank you. - My name is Ciro. Thank you, Ciro. How many times I thought about your hands? Hands that gave me so much pleasure... Goodbye. - Who is this? - I don't know, some Italian. He looks suspicious. - It is prohibited to unauthorized persons to enter the hospital. - He was allowed to enter. Must be from supplies. Why he didn't put the stuff outside? Alice, you better bring Duccio inside, it started to rain. Coming immediately, Mrs. Jennifer. Can you wait, Don Vincenzo? I want to quickly finish my letter.. I am at your service. Bye now. I can not wait when we meet. Give me chocolate... I will show you my ornaments... This is the Dionysus with Venus. He is a happy God. - And she gives love. - It is not right to use that word. So let's call it eroticism. It's also a component of love. - There are in agreement. - Yes, Jennifer, it is a love without sin... Romans were not shy. - It was a a brothel ? - Yes, Colonel, a luxury brothel... Reserved for American officials. I'm going to the jeep for another film. Do not listen to this idiot. .. How nice to see you again. I know you like this kind of art. I find it rather obscene. - Are you single ? - No! - I thought you came to see me. I'm crazy that I talk to him again. - No! - Why? Our destiny was to meet again, and you want to go! - I love you ! - Ciro! Now what? - Where are you hiding? - Ciro... Good-bye ! Come, Ciro ! We must go ? - Goodbye! - Come on, let's go! Later that day, I thought only of you. I was sure that you would see me, and it gave me hope. I wanted to laugh at what I wrote. You were part of me! I had no one until then. And you... you know... - Good luck ! - Cheers! - Why Fred did not come? - His battalion remained in the north. But you, are you waiting for Fred ? He said he's waiting for me. He was in the hospital, injured during the landing. - It's so romantic! - Did he mention anything about marriage? The military does not want you to marry him after the first kiss ? Let's go ! Hey Jennifer, look. - Your Italian is here. - My Italian ? - Yes... waiter. - It's not him. Then I can say it is just another nice Italian. I knew that none of us, had intercourse with Italian. It was almost like relationship with a black. The idea that the my Italian could be taboo... I wanted more, and I tried to deny... This is a special olive, I'm sure you'll try. - Taste it. - No, thank you. - Do it for me. - Go away. - Please go away. - Why? They look at me, what a shame. Who is so ashamed? You or me? Don't be ridiculous. - I love you! - You don't know me. - Do you think you need to know? - Enough nonsense! I want to marry you. It was a shock to me. This was against my principles. My God. The door is open. I slammed them after I walked in. I'm not so sure. The lock is broken. I wanted... I wanted to leave. To leave him. You didn't tell me your name. Do not ask. - Where are we going? - There, up! I want to take a picture of the monastery. It is beautiful, I like it. Are you crazy ? Piece of junk! That's what I need! Damn! No water... - There is no water in the radiator. - And what then... Then, then.... - If we'll not fill it with water, we're stuck! - Where's the water? - Where is the water? You are really funny. Of course I am. What about your radiator... You're kidding, but I think that can do! A little urine, enough to get us to the first house. - Do you want me to leave? - Why - Look at you. - Stop Rosa. Pisss, pissss.... ! You see, I can not pee. This is all your fault! Give it to me, I will help you. Look. You can watch. I'm done. Well, I think that should be enough? I have to be careful. You are great! So, if I believe it's true? This is salty water ! It cost me my hat. Churches... 500 years old art... ... were full of acts. Images of Adam and Eve... Images of Saint Sebastian... Images of Magdalene... Before all eyes. Sensual and provocative as you. Stop joking about the saints. I liked you more when you had your beard. Were you wounded during the war? Many believe in it. And I let them believe that. It is usefull to be like Russian soldier. Cossacs... Revolution. Me, as well as the Italians... We have hoarseness because of women. I would like to be like these women. Why you are not coming Ciro? Did you receive my letter? Isn't a crime to give up those days, which can be wonderful? Many times I was afraid, if you want to see me again. That's punishment for my mistake. Oh, Ciro. If I could live again a certain moment of my life. Only with you I felt really happy ... - Come closer. - No, because the boat is rocking... - Do what I say. - Well... Wait. Is it here? Yes, stop! - Wait for me until I get back. - I'll be waiting for you all my life. Ciro... when I saw our room... Walls, the floor, bed... The same bedding, wardrobe, mirror... Curtains with flowers... Everything was like before! Al the memories came back... Do you remember the night, When you walk through the window. I was angry, it caused unbearable pain of waiting. Professor called this twice. He said he will call again. - I think that's him. - Yes. Is that you, Fred? Do not worry, you can stay. Duccio feels good. No, don't worry. - Good-bye, darling. - Goodbye. I'll call you when the time will allow... I was able to talk to Arthur, he agreed to extend the trip if necessary. Who is this unrelenting Arthur? Does he have a wife? Eat, tonight you must be satisfied! - But I'm no longer hungry! - Not quantity counts but only quality. In America... Size does matter! In America, of course, there is a mania of sizes. - Who are you laughing at? - To the gentleman behind you. - Is everything all right? - Lovely! - Steak was delicious, like in Rome. - It's a merit of meat. It's true, it's a matter of quality. I was sure they you'd appreciate a good steak. Nice to meet you. - Gaston de Coligne. - Parsons. We represent UNESCO for Italian artistic values. Very interesting. I have a villa on a hill, which you should see. - Please, be my guests tonight. - Thank you, but we still have much to do. What a shame. - You look like a nymph! - What is a nymph? In ancient mythology, nymphs were nature's personification. You are a nymph of the forest. A nymph of nature, the mountains. Instead of taking the pictures of ruins, take pictures of me? - You could sell pictures in America. - This is an idea! Very materialistic. I'm telling you, I think it's a wonderful idea. If you want to photograph nymph Rosalia, you have to pay! - Am I beautiful? - Yes! As beautiful as paradise! Do you know who called me that ? Diomira, my mother. And men called me as well, when I was little. She was so jealous! Is Alfredo your father? No... Alfredo took my virginity. What's the matter with you, have you been enchanted? The love letter I wrote ten days ago. You don't give a sign of life. Ciro, why don't you answer? Why? This morning I was in our room in the Mortensen guesthouse. The view of our bed sparked wild desires. Ciro, why you let me suffer? I go mad thinking that for two days and two nights you were everything to me... Now I know that you are the only man I ever loved. The only one... It's me, Don Vincenzo ! I brought a loaf of bread straight from the oven. I brought goat cheese to eat with the bread. It's bad for my cholesterol, and I do not want to waste it. You can eat without worries. Thank you, please tell Mrs. Mortensen, that today I do not need anything. - Do not worry! - Thank you! It's you. Why did you touch me? I was unable to resist, I like to touch you. If we were husband and wife, you could touch me anytime you want. Wake up in the middle of the night... Reache out and find... - Darling. My love. - Wait. First, tell me you love me. If I didn't love you, do you think we'd have done all this? Slowly. Very slowly. Slowly... You have to feel... Now, stop. Don't think about anything. Sit down. No...no! Why, Ciro ? Why, why, why... ? You must tell me that you can't live without me. I can not, can not live without you ! That's good. You can start again. - Do you feel me? - I feel you. - I can no longer resist, Ciro! - Wait. Don't finish. We have to do it together. Yes, I'll wait. Tell me when you're ready. Now, Jennifer ! Now.... ! My darling...! I love you...! Come back, Ciro! Then ask me again ! I beg you, I can no longer live without you. Do you have a different answer to what I've asked you in Naples? What do you mean ? I said, I would like to be with you. Ciro, don't be stupid. Do you think I'm crazy? I want us to be together ! First, we should wait until the end of the war. I want to be with you... First, finish eating oysters! You were right, Ciro. I should marry you, to be with you. Please forgive me, because I couldn't do it then. Now I am willing to do everything! I swear, everything! They are moments when I feel, that my job is not important! Some people ask me, why I'm doing it? It turns out that everything is important. Do you believe me? In any case, I like life! - Slow down. Look! - What is it? A dance... ! Stop ! I want to dance. I'm tired, I have done so much work. I have to be... - If you do not want to go, I go alone. - Don't you... - Oh, what? - Nothing. - Do you want a drink? - No, I want to dance! - When did he appear and what for? - I don't know. - Bourbon, scotch and a beer ! - Immediately, sir ! Now you dance with me ! - I dance with who I want! - Hey, don't just cut in! - Come on ! - I'll show you! Look here ! They'll kill him! Leave him alone, he is an American ! Go and help him, Jack ! Enough! Get out of both of you! An American, get out of here! Go back to American ! And you... who are you to give the orders? What do you want? I like you. Good... ! - This country is shit! They cut my tires. - Thanks God I have my jeep. We helped the Americans during the war. They were nice guys to do business, but fools with the women. - What do you mean? - Nothing ! - Say what you want, I do not care. - Listen, American! It was a good time for business. I bought materials left after the war. Aircraft engines, scrap metal, weapon. Is not hard to make a good deal. Why not to start a business together ? It is better to forget about women, otherwise you get nothing. Like Clark Gable, who danced with her. He was the best in the business. Soon, he went bankrupt. You understand, that times have changed. Remember that you can make money. Even if you are not a hero. You understand what I mean, americano ? You must take advantage of this situation before the situation takes advantage of you. No one took advantage of me ! Of course, handsome, you know what you're doing. But do not be offended if I tell you something. There comes a time in which a whore is only a whore. - Mrs. Jennifer ! - Yes. Duccio is not feeling well. What is wrong with you? Where does it hurt? Duccio. My baby. He has a temperature. Prepare some wet towels. Faster, faster! We need a doctor. I'll call Don Vincenzo. Duccio, my dear. Don't cry ! Is this Normani Restaurant in Villa Serenella? It's Mrs. Jennifer. I need to talk to Don Vincenzo. My God! Send me a taxi, hurry up, please! Tell Don Vincenzo I will meet him at the market, near the church. Thank you so much. Goodbye! They are all at the church, it's a holiday. I called the taxi, I will bring the doctor. Don Vincenzo, Duccio is sick. We need a doctor ! He's in the church with the others. Look, there he is. Ciro.... ! Jennifer ! What a surprise! What are you doing here? Stella, Lietta, come here. This is Jennifer, a friend from the war. This is Stella, a royal dignitary. What a coincidence. We have to celebrate. With pleasure. I'm Lietta, Stella's secretary. Ah, yes! She was my secretary. She's now secretary of Ciro. Let's all go to the restaurant Marin. There have the best oysters. Beautiful, I'm crazy about oysters! Let's go! - I would like to... - What? - Why didn't you answer the letter? - What letter? I haven't received a letter. Nor did I know that you came. - That's why I sent a letter to the Hotel Excelsior. Ah... Hotel Excelsior... - The reception said that you would be there. I've waited for two weeks. Day and night. You were here and you didn't even try to see me. What are you saying, Jennifer? I came with them long time ago. Please Ciro, I wants us to be together tonight. - Are you crazy? How can I do that? - Are you with them? - What's wrong with you? - Nothing! I can explain. It's Stella's show, where I work. Listen, Miss. Jennifer. - Ciro is a stinking shit! He is a a playboy, surrounded by a lot of women. - What are you talking about? - But he is nice, isn't he? - Ms. Jennifer, do you see that he does not deny? - Can you shut up? A gigalo! Lietta, why the hell are you laughing at? Let's go. They pay you, don't they? Who do you think I am? - I'll see you tomorrow. - Tonight, please. - I must leave you for little while. - I'll be waiting in Villa Serenella. - But not earlier then in few hours. - Swear that you will come. I swear. Jennifer... believe me I want very much. Here is what I will do. I'll leave you my watch. This is a promise. And what do you want me to do? It is all I have. I'll take it just to have the pleasure to give it back to you. - These were beautiful times. - When? The day we met, you hair waved back and forth... and that girl that we met... Her name was Jennifer, right? Who was that man? Your lover? Yes, yes... my lover. What is this, damn laundry? We have to go back to Rome. You soiled my pajamas, and now I have to wash it. Didn't you say you have extended the mission? Do you like to be a housewife? Don't be afraid that I want to marry you. It is better that way. I thought you had created a story. - Yes? What kind of story? - Our story. - Why would I do that? - A woman needs a story. - What about the men? - No, for them, it's not worth the effort... Poor Fred. That guy from jeep was right. Times have changed but whore is a whore and nothing more. - I'm going out to make a phone call. - That's good! Bravo, bravo! Go to call me Arthur! But it could be a story... It's nothing serious, just a slight abdominal pain. But you did right to call me. I'm sorry, I lost it and I panicked. When I arrived, Duccio already felt better. - Must be hungry. - Come on, Don Vincenzo. Let Mommy stay with her exquisite champion. - I will lead, thank you for coming. - After you, please. You need to sleep... So... Now you have to sleep. One moment, please. It's for you, sir.. Hello... Jennifer. How are you? Hello... Jennifer, I can not hear you. We are all right. Duccio had a slight pain in the abdomen. How does his belly feel now? He is fine now, maybe the weather is better here. The keys. I feel a little guilty for you and Duccio. I shouldn't have left you alone. My trip is almost done, I'm coming back to Rome. - When are you coming back? - Tomorrow. Can you hear me, Jennifer? Are you still there ? Yes. I love you, Jennifer. - Duccio needs me? - I'll see you in Rome. Of course. Goodbye, Fred. Goodbye. Do you remember Rome? Rosa's home? Did you like it to be there with me ? Remember? One day when I came, you disappeared. Gone, got married... It was sad, Jennifer. I just could not accept that, Jennifer. But you needed me... And I you. Ciro.... ! I want to go to America, Jennifer. You and me in America. I will carry you in my arms. He is some supplier... supplier... supplier... ... My name is Ciro... Ciro... Ciro. This is an innocent love... love... love... I assure you Jennifer, your Italian is nice... nice... nice... Do as I say... I say... I say... He's a pimp. ... Shitty playboy... playboy... playboy... He is maintained by other women... women... women... What would you like I have to be... be... be...? Enough! Daddy loves you. What's going on? Duccio, what a beautiful boy. You are still pale. Do you like it? Alice. Take him to his room. Bye, bye. You look different with you hair up... I fixed my hair before we left. It's as if I saw your neck for the first time. I have an appetite for your body. Answer, I am sure it's for you. I am not expecting any phone call. You ? Hello. I know where are your letters. I'm sorry, I do not understand. Who do you want to talk to? The letters from Ciro. Who's this? I think you have the wrong number. I will repeat, you have the wrong number. This person is not here. Hello, hello! Who is this? Who was it, why did they hang up? - What is they wanted? - I do not know, it was a mistake. Was it a man or a woman ? A woman, spoke Italian. I could not understand what she said. Of course it was some idiot having fun and making jokes. Of course. I'm sorry, Fred. I still worry about Duccio? He needs a lot of things. I'll see if everything is in order. Well, I'll go to the office and prepare a report on monuments. See you later. Hello, is this reception? Can you tell me how to exchange the traveler's cheques? Many thanks. See you in half an hour. Thank you. Jennifer... I want to talk to you. Come in, I thought that you would come. - Thank you. What do you want? I'm listening. So... What do you want? Or maybe I should ask, how much do you want? Who, me? Why would I want to keep him? How much do you want for the letters? - That's why you came here! You said on the phone that you know where they are. Of course I know. The Hotel Excelsior, where you send them. Did Ciro tell you about it? Yes, Ciro, Ciro! He gave you this address, so he could laugh at you. I was trying to tell you on the phone, but you gave me to Fred. Why are you afraid of? That I know the truth? You think Fred knews? To tell you the truth! Who do you think I am? And you, who you think you are? Rosa... Rosa... Take them! Give as a gift to your husband. He was in such a hurry to get back to you, that left them in the bed, where we made love. - You and Fred? - Yes, me and Fred! Now go. I have a man who waits for me... Good morning. Good morning... - Fred... What are you doing here? - Jennifer, let me explain. Not here, please! Come on, let's go from here. I do not know where you want to go. Let's just leave this place. - Are you ready to order? - Yes. - Pizza. - Margherita, Capriciosa, Napolitano...? - Napolitana. What do you want? - The same. - With cheese... - Yes, thank you. - Stop crying. Let me explain. - Don't say anything. Please, stop. Jennifer... - Now, there is a free table! - Yes, carry me. - Perhaps it will be a success. - And if not? I've tried so many times! Now, take me in your arms ! - You are light, aren't you? - Certainly. - Are you comfortable? - Yes, thank you. I spotted you with lipstick. - Jennifer. Occupied. Jennifer. Jennifer ! I loved another one, I had another one before I fall in love with you. While you were with Rosa... I came across him and I had him again! Why do not you call me a whore? Was it that man on the photograph? He was sitting between me and Rosa when we met that evening. His name is Ciro. - Did you meet him today? - No... Today I was at Rosa's because she knew, where are the letters that I wrote. And that was the blackmail. - Blackmail of Rosa? - Yes. The letters that have never reached Ciro are still at the Excelsior. He told me to send them there. - How do you know? - Rosa told me. Ciro was never there. Gave me this address to make fun of me. Italians do not understand anything. Not Italians. I know Rosa well. I am not innocent. You were excited about the thought that Ciro brought me to that house. Rosa and her mother rented rooms by the hour. A large room, with big photos. With a mirror above their head. - We made love in the same bed. - Rosa told me almost the same. What did you say to Rosa? - I'm leaving you. - Leaving me? What do you mean? So I decided. Will leave today, Fred. Hello. Car 9 and 11. Is Professor coming? He has something to do. Look. I got everything. Let's go. Train will leave immediately, Please take your seats in the cars. I was at the Hotel Excelsior. I was unable to get them without guidance. Rosa was fair. Want to read them? Do you want I told you about me and Rosie? I do not want Fred. This story is about us... - Are you excited? - My head explodes... You know what? Love is the meeting of two fantasies. - Is that what Rosa told you? - No, that's what I told her! I believe that love means freedom. - Ciro told you that? - No, I said that. The same thing. - Don't move. Do you feel me? - I feel you. Let us leave our legacy on this train! Let's try ! I expect that when you will not be able to stop, then you tell me. I say "I love you" . And I will respond: "I love you, too, Fred". Courtesy of YAFI! JAGA BKS
