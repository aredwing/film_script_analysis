This ceremony is a prelude... to the great festival of Ong- Bak... that will commence here in seven days... and which is heldjust once... every 24 years. It marks the auspicious completion of two cycles. - May peace and prosperity reign in our community. Where's the Buddha amulet? The bust shows sign of wear, the head's slightly chipped. Hardly perfect condition! 200,000 baht is a good price! Why won't you sell it? Name your price! Don, it's not for sale! I've come all the way from Bangkok! I took time off work! I never told you I'd sell it! I'm keeping it for my son, Humlae! For when he is ordained as a monk! When you decide to sell, call me! Forget it! I don't have a telephone! I'll give you my address! When you decide to sell, write me! Grounded feet! Crocodile tail! Elephant face! Hanuman's ring! Bolting horse! The ogre's sword! The fall of Hera! Soldiers marching! Mad elephant!

Cliff shaking! Sticky water! Throwing the spear! Breaking the sword! Raising the body! Horse replacing bird! I have taught you the art of Muay Thai! Now I ask you never to use it! - Is that clear? - Yes, master! Good! You're wondering why! Aren't you? In his youth, your master learned the ancient art of Muay Thai! Under the great master Kru Dam! He was impatient to try out his skills! In a rope fistfight, he killed his opponent! Overcome with guilt, he decided to become a monk! Muay Thai is dangerous! He doesn't want you fooling around with it! Is it clear now? If you're still not convinced! Go a few rounds with me, Ting! Uncle! Huh? Hey, you vandals! What are you doing? Move it! That scumbag Don! Severed the head of Ong-Bak! He also stole the poor box, master. Don is a bastard! If we can't recover Ong- Bak's head... our village is doomed! Calm down. We'll find a way! To bring the Buddha's head back before the great ceremony. But who will bring it back? I'll bring it back! I know where Don lives! The fate of the whole village! Lies in your hands! This sacred amulet contains Ninpat herbs! My grandfather told me it belonged to Kru Dam! Keep it close to your heart! Here's Don's address! And please give this letter to Humlae!

Everybody... give what you can! For the journey! BANGKOK  Shit, I lost!  Come here! Who'd you pick to race? We lost by miles! It was a fair race! Win some, lose some! You're being a bad loser! You put up a girl against me? -  - So I'm a girl! So what? Do you know who you're talking to? Shame you don't race as fast as you talk! Screw you!  -  - Here's 10,000! The rest's security on your debts! I pay you interest every month and it's not due yet! Give me some so I can bet! - Take it or leave it! - I guess it's better than nothing! Hey, give me those! You got cash! You can leave the tabs for my boys! You guys can score what you need anytime, anywhere! Why you wanna take mine? It's too strong for these pussies, anyway! Hand it over, okay? Shithead! There you are at last, George. Where's my share? Quick! I'm in a hurry! That asshole Peng got wise to our scam! He kept all the money! What? If this is a joke it's not funny! Look! Check out my face! You think I did that myself? Hands off, I just got beat up! Your bad luck! How could he tell? Forget it! You got 200 baht? Hold on! Pay up first, borrow later! You always take your share of the dough! But never your share of the beatings! You're the one who messed up! I messed up, smarty-pants? Peng has given me three days to pay up... or he'll come after me. Humlae! It is you, isn't it? Greetings! Is he a friend of yours? What do you mean? He's talking to you! You know this hillbilly? Don't you remember me? Ting from Nong Pradu! Yeah, right! I don't know you! I don't know you! Got that, sucker? I remember you! You're Humlae! What kind of a name is that? Dumbest name I ever heard! Clear out before I kick your ass! Go easy, Humlae- George, I mean! You are such a pain in the ass, sister! Get out of here! - What was the name of your village? - Nong Pradu! Right, I'll leave the Nong Pradu boys to it! You must have lots to talk about! He shows up and you take off! Go then! But leave me some dough! Buy yourself a Band-Aid! See ya, Humlae! As for you, country boy, go back where you came from! Humlae, your dad gave me a letter for you! I don't know you! Scram! This is my room! Forget about earlier! Close the door or it'll be swarming with mosquitoes! I was out of line! Sorry! You know, our village is in big trouble! Don and his men stole Ong-Bak's head! Your dad told me to come and find you! So we could get it back! - I have Don's address here! - Save it for later! Here, dump your gear and go take a shower! Go on! Come on, it'll do you good! Through here! - Then can we- - Later! Here's a towel! I'll even turn on the light for you! Soap's on the left, toothpaste on the right. And don'tjerk off all over the floor. Hi, is that you, Muay? Meet me at the Khaosan Road fight club. Still time to place a bet on Ali? All of it! Where's the amulet? Their pigheaded chief refused to sell! So I took Ong-Bak's head instead, boss! He's the village deity, boss! They revere him! You wasted your time! It's a lousy lump of stone! You're such a jerk! Get this rock out of my sight! Before I really get mad! Your boys keep letting you down, huh? And now Pearl Harbour's! Going to get the kamikaze treatment from my boy Ali! You seem very sure of that! If you think your guy can win it, up the stakes! I have no limit! Call me whenever, babe! Next fight, if you're still game! Maybe you'd like to up the stakes! The winner, Pearl Harbour! Bastard! Pearl have won three men! - Shit!

Yup, we can wave good-bye to Ting! I'll give you 10 to 1! But perhaps you'd better not risk it! Okay, let's up the ante to one million! I'm in! I don't want to fight! I just want my cash! No sweat, kid, leave it to me! Fight! We've got a new champion tonight- - What's your name? - Ting from Nong Pradu! Ting, the Pradu Legend! Prize for the winner! No, I just want my money back! What an idiot! Why didn't you take the dough, lunkhead? If you want to fight again, let me know! You're good, you can beat anyone! I see us getting very rich! I don't box for money! What got into you, stealing the villagers' money? Not stealing, investing! When we're rich, I'll help you find Ong-Bak! - Really? - You bet! Here's Don's address! Can you take me? Hold on to it, I'll take you later! Meantime, lend me some! I'll pay you back when I win! Then I'll take you! Trust me! Okay, get lost! I asked you nicely, damn it! About the loan you asked for to set up a business... I can't help you... because of the drought in the village. Worse than that, Don stole Ong- Bak's head. I want you to help Ting to get it back... to change our fortune. Numskulls! The well's nearly dry! What will we do for water? Please, God, help them find Ong-Bak! How's business? You got your losing face on? - Hi, Lao! - Hi, George! Where you been all this time? - Working with friends! - I'm short of staff!

You should be home looking after the kids! - What are you staring at, asshole? - Get out! And get the dye out of your hair! Don't copy off me! Let's see your money! If you lose don't blame me! Double nine! Deal me in! - You got money? - 3,000 baht! Enough for you? Let her play, if she wants to lose! We'll clean her out! Double eight! Rake in the dough, George. Wait! I have double nine! Pay up! - The house has a six. Shit. - I have a nine! - Triple eight! - Nine points for me! What's happening with the cards? She's on a hot streak! Shejust got lucky, that's all, boss. I got a nine! - Eight points again! - Nine points again! Fuck! I win again! Pay up! Eight for me! Nine for me again! You lose! Leave your cards on the table! I want to see if the chick's cheating! She got nine points 15 times! And I lost every round! If you get a nine this time! It means you're definitely cheating! You little devil! Let's see! I've got eight again! If you get nine points, you'd better watch out! Y'see, boss, she got four points. - Look! - I don't believe it! She has hidden cards! I'll search her! Calm down. I'll handle it.

I'll take you to find Ong-Bak! Will you box for me just once more? Listen to me! You saw the trouble I was in! If I don't pay up, I'm dead! Help me! Fight once more! Last time! Please- Lay off him! So don't help me! Screw your stupid village! Sending one guy against a whole gang... to recover Ong-Bak? Crazy! If Ong-Bak's so great, why's he headless? He's just a bit of rock! Ting!
