The Tricolour must have been flown on the Red Fort. But today its colours ... ... are painting the hearts of two nations in a single colour ... ... the colour of peace. And this is because of two friends whose friendship ... ... even borders could not wipe out. Their friendship has existed since ... ... they weren't Chaudhary Vikramjeet Singh ... ... and Pathan Liyaqat Ali Khan to each other ... ... but Vicky and Lucky. Oye, my dear friend! Vicky sir and Lucky sir. Greetings. - One from Amritsar and the other from Lahore. Tell us the secret of this friendship. Cricket! Cricket? See, what happened was that we picked up the bat together ... ... learnt bowling ... ... and also started 'fielding' with the girls together. But in 1947, such a pitch was laid. .. ... that the one hour journey between Lahore and Amritsar ... ... took 40 years to complete. But these two nations ... ... lndia and Pakistan ... ... are the sons of only one mother. They're just lying with their backs to each other. So, as soon as the border opened we thought... ... that lndia and Pakistan's independence celebrations ... ... why don't we celebrate together? So cricket has, once again, brought us together. One year on the 14th of August ... ... Pakistan's lndependence Day. And another year on the 15th of August ... ... lndia's lndependence Day. Yes, one year in Pakistan and the next year in lndia. For this Aman Cup, our teams play a cricket match. Aman Cup? Yes, madam. For the last 8 years this cup has been the pride of Lahore! Oye, let it be. lt seems that these Amritsar folks have developed ... ... a special love for losing. Oye, you son-of-a-Lucky! lf in today's match we don't make their team un-lucky ... ... then my name isn't Vikramjeet Singh! Come on boys! Come on boys! So as you've just seen ... ... though the name is Aman (peace) Cup ... ... the spirit is no less than in a war! To Amritsar's Jagdev Kallan ground ... ... we welcome all you cricket lovers. This Aman Cup match is being played between ... ... Vikramjeet Singh's lndian Tigers ... ... and Liyaqat Ali Khan's Pakistani Champs. The match will begin in just a few moments from now. Today, for the first time, this Aman Cup match ... ... will not be a 50 overs match ... ... but a 20 overs match instead. You will recall that in the past 8 years ... ... Vikramjeet Singh's lndian Tigers have been defeated in all matches. Come on lndian Tigers, buck up! Well done, well done, Pakistani Champs! Here, take this. Here, eat some sweets. Here. Oh no, oye no. Hey eat it, eat it. - Leave it, man! Hey, eat some. After losing, there should be something ... ... left in the stomach. Exactly like the last time, once again ... ... the Pakistani Champs have won the toss ... ... and decided to bat first. Oye, lndia's lads! Tear them apart - Go for it! Kuljit Singh, of the lndian Tigers ... ... will start the bowling. The captain of the Pakistani Champs, Ali Ansari ... ... stands ready to face him. The first ball of the match. Over the wicket ... ... and Ali Ansari has sent the ball flying to the boundary for four runs! Oye! What a shot! What an impressive start by Ali Ansari! Short paced delivery ... ... and crossing the boundary for four runs! Moving on to the front foot, he has driven it for another four! Beautiful shot. What an impressive and courageous display of batting! Pakistani Champs have completed 100 runs ... ... without losing a wicket. Well done, well done boys, come on! Another fantastic shot! The lndian Tigers are not getting a single opportunity ... ... to stop these batsmen. ln the face of such an amazing batting display by the Pakistani Champs ... ... the lndian Tigers' bowling has, once again, been disappointing. The last ball of the Pakistani innings ... ... another six! At the end of 20 overs, the Pakistani Champs have scored 1 78 runs. The lndian Tigers' openers, Jeetu and Khosla ... ... are walking towards the pitch. Oye, Jeetu, Sir. 1 79 runs is a big target. Think carefully and play. Okay, Sir? Hey, who's this? - Don't know, man! This Khosla doesn't know his own off-stump ... ... how will he know me? You talk too much ... now go. Jeetu, Sir. Don't pull the ball. Previously, it was while pulling that you got out! Okay? Now you go. All the best! Fine? Come on boys, come on, come on! Pakistani fast bowler, Yunus, has begun his run-up. Jeetu has hit it into the air ... ... and he's out! A very easy catch. Out! Out! Wow! Pakistani Champs get their first wicket. A bad start for the lndian Tigers. Come on, lndia. Go, lndia! He has hit it high in the direction of mid-off ... ... and Khosla is out. Oh, shucks! And that's out! lndian Tigers have lost another wicket. Their score is just 7 runs for the loss of 3 wickets. Next delivery by Ali Ansari ... ... and the batsman became confused. He has given a simple catch! Oh, well done! Get out! Oye, Ali Ansari, you're the captain and cursing! Well done! All the spectators are disappointed. What, Vicky my friend? What's happened now? lt's all over. We've won. He's played it gently towards the off-side ... ... and what's this? There's no time to take a run ... ... but Pukhraj has started running. He's still too far from the crease. Will he be able to take the run? But the stumps have been hit ... ... and after a huge appeal, the umpire has raised his finger. Congratulations captain, well done! Thank you, Sir! Friends! Lahore's pride is once again heading to Lahore! Oye, my dear friend! Why are you standing there with a swollen face? Losing and winning is just an excuse ... ... to relive all our old memories. Right? No sir, l don't agree. Losing and winning are never an excuse. Losing is losing and winning is winning! You're right, Ali Ansari. Losing is losing and winning is winning. l'm tired of losing. Here ... take ... leg spin. Oye, do you all want to do any work-shirk or not? Veera! When will this cricket demon get off your head? Huh? Uncle ... ... yesterday if l had been on the pitch ... ... by God, l swear ... ... our town would have won the match! You wait and see, this time l'll play for our town ... ... and the next time ... ... straight ... l'll open for lndia. Hmmm ... Come back to Earth, Veera. With such tiny eyes, don't see such big dreams. They'll bring you nothing but pain. Uncle, l have a dream and so l exist. Without it l am nothing. Oye, Chamkile. - Yeah? Bowl to me. - Hand me the umbrella! Oye, Veera, today l'm definitely going to get you out! Until now, no such boy has been born ... ... who can get me out! Come on, man! Thanks, man! Hey guys, l'm going to catch up with you later. Yeah? Right. Bye. D.R.C. rules, man! D.R.C. rules, man! Hello! Yup? Alright ... yup. l'll be there by the next flight. Thank you. Mom? Mom, are you sure you won't come ... ... to lndia with me? No, Rohan. Your Dad doesn't want me ... ... it's you he needs. You know that. But Mom, my Dad ... ... is also related to you, right? Anyway, don't worry. He'll be fine. l won't let anything happen to him. Okay, now leave quickly ... ... or you'll miss the plane. Love you, son. Love you, mom. Ladies and gentlemen.

Come home, come. - No, Dad ... l'm ... ... l'm catching the next flight and going back because ... ... this is not right, Dad! Hey buddy, you've come after 10 years.

Just another one of his silly jokes. Yeah ... l'll tell you when l get back. l'll come back soon. Love you. Bye. She still worries about me? Come on, Dad. Mom always remembers you ... ... but the fault was yours. After your marriage, if she wasn't happy living in lndia ... ... you would take her to England. You promised her that, right? But you broke your promise. lt wasn't written on stamp paper! This country is mine. lts people are mine. England's cold has turned Yamini's heart cold too. Dad, the way lndia is your country, in that way ... ... England is Mom's country, right? And ... you know that she tried her best to adjust out here. But what did you do? You lied to her and today you lied to me. Right? Hey ... hey! What? No, man! ln your England, cars must also be breaking down, right? Dad. l didn't say anything. l'm fine. Oh very good! l'll stop this vehicle. Hey, stop for a minute. One minute, stop please. Hello sir ... what happened? Nothing sir. My car is sulking. Dad ... ... this junk heap! Hey! What did you call a junk heap? Dad. There's no way l'm going in ... ... this junk heap. This looks like a marriage truck! No sir, this is our Best Friend Dance Company truck. You English?

Hey listen, me ... me not English ... ... me lndian! You not lndian! You not live lndia! Yeah, yeah ... l not live lndia. But l love lndia! Live there, love here! No, no. This my lndia ... Okay, Sir? Handle with care! Hey, listen, Miss lndia! Today lndians all over the world making the lndia the proud ... ... so why are you thinking the so small? Very bad, Buffalo Girl! Oye, donkey, you're the buffalo! So is your whole family! Myself, Veera Kaur! Hey ... Veera Kaur!

All your manners ... ... have you left them buried in the Queen of England's crown? Huh? lf my shoulder had been dislocated, then? So, for the rest of your life, just like the Statue of Liberty ... ... you're going to keep standing like that? No! Going to dig you a grave in the Taj Mahal! Have you even heard of the Taj Mahal? - No! Or are you as clueless as the buffalo? Dad ... are we there yet? Here, Mr. Chamkila. Stop here, Sir, stop here. Mr. Chamkila. - Yes, Sir? l really enjoyed talking to you! Me also, Sir. Rohan, son, come ... we're home. Thank you, Sir, thank you! Hey, Buffalo Girl ... ... bye. The name's Rohan, by the way. Nice to meet you too! Rude foreigner jerk! Dad, since when have you been playing these matches? You've never spoken about them. For many years. l thought that the day l win ... ... the first person l'd give the good news to would be you. But ... ... it seems that now this dream will never be fulfilled. ls that why you've called me here, Dad? That's why you lied to me? What do you want from me, Dad? l want this dream of mine ... ... to be fulfilled by you. You can't be serious, Dad! ln England, every cricket county wants me to play for them ... ... and you want me to stay here with you? Dad, like this ... ... leaving England, leaving Mom ... ... l can't live here. lt's impossible! - lmpossible, why? Your cricket county season is over. ln 15 years, for the first time, l'm asking for 6 months from you. l hope your mother ... ... can give your 6 months to me. That Dad ... who for 15 years ... ... kept aside only 1 month in each year for his son ... ... for him, doesn't 6 months seem like a lot, Dad? Get your math right, Dad! Yes, son. What should l do? A father's heart doesn't know maths. l had forgotten that ... ... in this father's share ... ... there's only a 30-day bonus. And l had also forgotten that ... ... that in cricket, you are now a very big player ... ... and your first coach ... ... very small. lt's your mother's phone call. Hi, Ma. Ma, not one week ... ... l'll come back in 6 months. Yes, Ma, l know what l'm doing, yeah. No, no it's not Dad. This is my decision. Don't worry, Ma. l'll call you later, yeah? Yeah, love you. Bye. Dad, your happiness ... ... your ways ... ... your life ... ... have always come before us. And today too, for us you come first. Everything else comes after. l'm ready, Dad. l'll lead your team. But the team will be mine ... ... and the terms will be mine. Thank you. Where's the team? What happened? lt's a simple question. Where's the team? We're right in front of you. Can't you see? Pukhraj, right? This looks like a team to you? l can only see some unfit players. For me, there's no team here, Pukhraj. l've come here to make my own team. A team in whose dictionary the word defeat does not exist. From among you whoever is selected ... - Select? Hey man, what is the need for selection ... ... when the team is ready? Oye, pretty boy! Do you know who l am? Delhi Ranji teams' fast bowler. You'll do our selection? lt's only because your Pop asked, that we are wasting 6 months of ours. The name is Chaudhary Vikramjeet Singh. Forget selection. lt's only because of him that l'm tolerating you. ln 6 months, the amount that you will earn here ... ... you can't earn that much in 6 years. So don't give me that crap, alright? Coz l'm not Dad ... ... and don't ever forget that. 20 minutes ... everybody warmed up on the field. Let's go, guys. Let's play some cricket. Oye, front foot ... defence.

Oh buddy, even l made a mistake, actually. l wentto the dressing room to look for you and ... And? What?! What are you saying?! You don't know Veera! She's a very touch-me-not type of girl. ln last year's election, she wasn't allowed to vote ... ... immediately, she sat dangling her feet off the well.

Sir, you go. ln this huge crowd ... ... where will we look for Veera? Why? Are we searching for the Kohinoor diamond? We're looking out for your sister. She must be around somewhere. Only if a sister exists, can she be found! What? Uh ... oh, me mean ... Sister? Sweet sister? Where are you? Are you looking for your sister ... ... or for a dog? You are the daughter of Chuchak and Malki, Heer! And l, a young man from Takht Hazara! Be it the waters of the River Chenab ... ... or some worshipper or saint ... l am your Ranjha.

Until now, l've never said sorry to any girl, alright! You're the first girl. And that too, the kind of girl ... ... who is pretending to be lndian! Right? Foreign boy, this is lndia. Here, you can't break someone's heart ... ... then use Sellotape to fix it! Alright. Cool. l too am the son of a Punjabi father! l've come to say sorry ... ... so l will say sorry before l leave! On your Best Friend stage ... ... in your performance style! Don't play this tune, Ranjha! Don't play it! You've already robbed me of my sleep at night ... ... and now you want to steal my daytime peace? What?! Oye, Ranjha one ... and Heer's two? Oh, Ranjha. Think and understand what Heer is saying ... ... and play your tune! How did Hollywood turn into Bollywood? Huh? How did it? What tune will this Ranjha play?! Applause! Oye buddy, you go play it, go! Ranjha! ln big, big countries such small, small things ... ... keep happening, Senorita! Sorry pal! Oh, Heer! Speak your dialogue! What is this senorita-senorita? Oye, Heer! Oye ,donkey! lt was your command ... ... that l did not heed. l am guilty ... ... l didn't fulfil your wish. Any sentence you pass ... ... will be accepted by me. This difficulty of mine ... ... only then will it vanish. Why did you hit me with a sling-shot? lt is bad manners. The next time, before you hit a girl ... ... think twice. Who has the time to think of someone else? l can only be this audacious with you! Why? What am l to you? O, Heer, now forgive your Ranjha! Thank you, buddy! Silence! lt happens, it happens ... foreign boy! ln friendship, there's no sorry, no thank you! Continue guys. First slip in. What's up? Veera hasn't brought flatbread today? No, Sir ... ... she won't come today. Okay ... ... did she say anything about me? No ... ... why would she say anything about you? No, just like that. Fine. Say hi to her from me. - Hi? Oye, Khosla. Oh-ho! Shane Warne has also never bowled a googly like that! Sachin, Sir, l'm getting hit-wicket ... help! Left shoulder on the off-side ... ... head over the ball, yeah? What is it? Sir, now the practice can't continue. Why? Are you taking an early retirement? Lord Rama, your River Ganges has turned muddy! Look over there! Oh God, Soniya man! Oh God, Soniya man! Sir ... ... Soniya ma'am is so sexy, no? Yours and her pairing ... ... will be hotter than Shahrukh and Kajol. Right? Yes, but she won't make hot, hot, flatbread filled with potato, no? Sir, you are taking the wrong lane. ln any case, with fried flatbread ... ... the lanes of the heart develop a traffic jam! What do they call it? Cal ... co-las-traul? But she won't hurl big, fat, heavy duty ... ... Punjabi abuses either, no? She will, Sir, she will. Should l go and ask her? - Oye, oye, oye! Stay right here. Understood? You?! Soniya ma'am, myself very, very sorry. lt's okay. Soniya ma'am ... ... this milk and cream are meant to go into the stomach. So why are you rubbing it on yourself? This isn't milk! lt's sun-tan cream. Cold-cream me knowing. What is this sun-tan cream? Anyway, whatever it is. You do know how to make flatbread? Yes? Flatbread? No. Why? So learn fast, fast. Or else, you'll be left applying this petrol rubbish ... ... while Rohan sir will get on his motorcycle ... ... asking someone else to sit behind him ... ... and he'll go, went, gone! Holy cow! So what should l do? Hmmm. Stop putting this cream-shreem. True beauty comes from the heart. Not from some cream. Not Miss Universe ... ... become Miss lndia. Be a little more traditional. Oh! - Oh! Rohan! Rohan! Hey, Soniya. Today, Soniya will show you Punjab in her own style. Yeah. Rohan, son, if you search a population of 1 billion ... ... even then, you won't find a tourist guide like her. So, Soniya, looking at you, l'm thinking ... ... that l too, should go along with you to see Punjab. What do you say? Good, good, good! l like it, l like it! l'm sure you also like it! Look Rohan, all these are my fields. Aren't they beautiful, just like l am? What fields are these? Uh ... l told you, these are my fields! No, Rohan is asking ... ... which crop has been planted in these fields? Crop ... l think ... uh ... Looks like the decision on the type of crop is still pending! Very funny! Oh, oh Sir! Greetings! Greetings! Greetings, child. Hey, Buffalo Girl! What are these people doing? Silly old-fashioned women! They're worshipping their husbands! They need any excuse ... ... to turn their husbands into God. Sometimes, for their long life ... ... and sometimes for one more son ... ... their prayers never end! Seriously! Today, when these farmers sow the first wheat plant ... ... their wives, without eating or drinking anything ... ... will bring it to life with their prayers. So tomorrow, when the tendrils burst out ... ... and the crop sprouts ... ... not one mouth in this country goes hungry! Soniya ma'am, it's not their own ... ... but your long life they're thinking of! The day these wo-man stop praying ... ... that day, the fair skin of wo-man like you will turn blue! Oye, now she'll start. Three cheers, child! Today you've put these English in their place! l feel that you ... ... could impart the importance of the smell of this earth ... ... to my son.

Oye, Veera! - Hmmm? You've done wonders! You're looking exactly like Katrina Kaif! Today, foreign boy will be clean and bowled! Oye, oye! Oye maybe, maybe l'll be the one to get hit-wicket!

Mention not, Sir ... ... l wanting you to see that ... ... our lndia also very modern. And whenever your heart desires ... ... can change in a flash and become your 'Made in England'. But lndia is lndia ... ... and Veera is Veera. Both special ... ... both different from the rest ... ... both one and only. Both don't need to change for anyone. To understand them both ... ... to love them both ... ... the others must change. Right! You couldn't tell me this earlier. Needlessly, 3 hours of effort were wasted ... ... in selecting this witch's dress. The more you try to get away The closer it gets lt steals your heart away Because in this land, love is the only god Because in this land, love is the only god ln cold, cold pudding ... ... dunk hot, hot sweets ... ... and then eat! And then wow..!! Wow..!! You know, Veera ... ...you've made my life very jokey. Jokey? - Yup. From my childhood till now l was leading my life in confusion. Grew up in London with my English friends ... ... so l tried to be English too. When l stayed with Mom ... ... l missed my Dad. When l visited Dad ... l missed my Mom. My whole life ... l was never completely happy. But after meeting you ... ... l realised that ... ... life is not meant to be lived so seriously ... ... nor with so much confusion. Life is meant to be lived the way Veera lives it. Laughing, playing, dancing. On the tip of one's toes! And after coming to my 'land that's like a sweet embrace', l found out ... ... that even if l go really far away from lndia ... ... lndia is never far from me. So then ... ... move over disco-goers ... ... now we're playing a country beat! Because whatever happens ... ... l am my Punjabi father's Punjabi son ... ... who may befriend a lot of English girls ... ... but his girlfriend ... ... will be a Punjabi girl like Veera. What? Yes, you. l've fallen in love with you, Buffalo-girl. Because you make my life very jokey. Oye, Veera! - Chamkila! Oye! Veera! Tomorrow morning, when you get late in leaving for Lahore ... ... then you'll blame-shame Veera! Yes, but ... ... at least tell me, yes or no? You return after winning the match tomorrow ... ... and then see ... ... the style in which Veera says yes! Oh yeah! l think l'm going to die! Oye, boy! Oye! Wow, wow, wow! What's going on, buddy? What's going on? Hey, you've come all dressed up. Why? Happy to be losing? Rohan, ask him ... ... when the fair women of Lahore ... ... place the crown of victory on my head ... ... will his pace-maker jump out of his thumping heart? You people solve your problems on your own. We have a match to win. Why, Ansari l'm right, aren't l? Rohan, Sir ... ... to win a match ... ... we have to check with you ... ... we're not in such a pathetic state yet! But after losing 9 matches ... ... one's faith in winning does tend to lessen! Why ... l'm right, aren't l? You'll receive the answer to that on the pitch, Ansari. Shall we, Dad? Come, come, let's go. l, Shonali Nagrani, welcome you all from Lahore. This historic match will begin in the evening, on the 14th of August ... ... but it will end in the lap of 15th August! lt's a day and night match, guys. Yes, Aman Cup's first day-nighter! And guys, please excuse my Urdu. What can l do? The environment here is like that! That was a funny joke, right? Oye, buddy! Build your strength, build your strength. You're going to lose just like before. Hey, we won't lose that easily! Sister-in-law! Good day to you, brother. Good day, good day, good day! Welcome, welcome, welcome! - Thank you. Please take a seat. Yes. Sister-in-law! l'll fetch some saffron tea for you. Okay. Thank you. Buddy! Hi. - Hi. Sit. You've become very weak. lt looks like you don't take care of your health. How many things can l pay attention to? But you're looking nice. No. l've put on weight. Yamini. l know that you have come here for your son ... ... but my heart wants to believe that, maybe, you've come for me. That has always been your problem. You ... ... only want to believe what your heart tells you. Anyway, don't worry. Don't worry about me. This was the only right l had remaining ... ... worrying about you. lf you retire that too ... ... then these bones will rust. l have never retired you. The captain of the lndian Tigers, Rohan Singh ... ... is leading his team on to the field. - Come on boys! Let's go! Buck up! Let's go! Today's Aman Cup match will ... ... once again, be a very entertaining competition. You can see the enthusiasm of the spectators. The spirit of the lndian Tigers' captain is unbreakable. Standing at the starting point of his run-up ... Rohan ... ... to bowl his first ball. Here he comes running. Quite a long run-up. Right arm, over the wicket. Oh wow! Pakistan Champs - zero for one! Captain of the Pakistani Champs, Ali Ansari ... ... is walking towards the crease. His belief in himself is at a peak ... ... because for the last few years, the Pakistani Champs ... ... have been winning the Aman Cup. Jeetu, catch it! Oye, wow, wow! So after 4 overs, the Pakistani Champs' score is ... ...1 7 runs with 1 wicket lost. And Jeetu has dived and taken a splendid catch. Pakistani Champs have lost another wicket. No, no, no! Howzzat?! Rohan's next delivery. The batsman has been deceived ... ... and there's an appeal for leg-before-wicket. The umpire has raised his finger ... ... and lndian Tigers get another wicket! Seeing the performance of the lndian Tigers ... ... the spirit of their supporters must have lifted. Guys, guys, guys! Listen up, listen up, listen up! 10 overs to go. We're going really well. We have to get them out under 100! Alright? Okay? Let's go! Alright! Alright! Let's go! At the half-way mark, the score of the Pakistani Champs ... ... stands at 46 runs for the loss of 5 wickets. Oye, get off! Oye! Oye, 10-10 of those louts have climbed on top of Veera. Hey, road-rollers, get off her! Someone lift me up! Alright boys! Let's go! Let's go! Let's do this! Let's finish this! Come on, come on. Balbir! Balbir, left. Go to the right. Veer! Veer! Ball. You did great, Veer Pratap Singh! Sir, coming! Sir, ball. What happened, Sir? Myself, Veer Pratap Singh. Right and left hand batsman. Which hand should l bat with? l'm Veer's sister! Veer is my brother! Ball? Give me the ball! Why isn't anyone handing me the ball, man? No ball! - And that's a no-ball. Rohan's left foot was way outside the crease ... ... and the Pakistani Champs get an extra run. Captain Rohan's next ball. Beautiful shot by Ali Ansari! The ball has gone past the fielder for 4 runs! Where's the ball? Another 4 runs! lt seems like Ali Ansari has suddenly woken up ... ... and taken a firm decision ... ... that he will not lose to the lndian Tigers! He's lofted it ... ... and the Pakistani Champs get 6 runs. Mid-off! Move to mid-off ... now! Catch it! - This time, Ali Ansari has pulled the ball ... ... and there could be a chance for a catch. Balbir has leapt up to take the catch ... ... but the ball has gone past for 4 runs. And with that, Ali Ansari has completed a century. Last ball of the innings ... ... straight towards Veer Pratap Singh. Will he be able to catch the ball..? But no ... the ball grazed past his fingers ... ... and fell outside the boundary line. Another 6 runs for the Pakistani Champs. Fielding by the lndian Tigers has been very weak. He should have taken that catch ... ... but Veer Pratap Singh failed to do so. So at the end, after 20 overs, the score stands at ... ... 213 runs for the loss of 6 wickets. lt seems that in the last 10 overs the lndian Tigers ... ... have gifted the match to the Pakistani Champs! The team that was struggling to make 100 runs ... ... has managed to set a difficult target of 214 runs! The same old story. Extremely disappointing! Rohan ... Didn't l make myself clear? This is the men's dressing room. Girls not allowed! Give me a chance to explain. - Shut up! Just ... shut ... up! l couldn't even imagine that you are such a good actress ... ... or should l say actor? You shouldn't be in your village theatre company ... ... you should be acting in a film. There, at least, you won't have to put on a show about being an lndian girl! You really are a world class batsman! You can do just about anything for runs! But you forgot ... ... that it wasn't some pitch ... ... but my heart that you stamped upon! Rohan, l didn't know ... l didn't ... - Why? Why did you do this to me? Why? The dream ... yours. Fake love ... yours. So why am l hurting? Why? You don't have an answer, right? Now in this team, not 1 1 ... ... but 10 players will play Dad. Khosla, pad up. You'll open with me. Why? Where's Veer? Why? Can't anything happen around here without Veer? Veer won't play! Rohan buddy, it's a huge score. We are depending on your and Veer's opening partnership! Who's the captain? Who's the captain? You or me? Whoever has any problems in this team can leave right now. l don't need anybody! Do you understand? To win, the lndian Tigers will have to make 214 runs. The required run rate is 10.7 runs per over. The captain of the lndian Tigers, Rohan Singh ... ... is taking his guard to start the innings ... ... and the ball will be bowled by ... ... the captain of the Pakistani Champs, Ali Ansari. First ball. Outside the off-stump ... ... and Rohan has driven it beautifully for 4 runs. Come on lndian Tigers ... come on. Oye, oye Chamkila! - Yes! Where's Veera? She's the one who opens the batting. Oye, where is she? And this time he's bowled a yorker to the batsman ... ... who couldn't even play the ball. Another blow for the lndian Tigers. Samir, catch it! He's given an easy catch to the fielder. lndian Tigers have lost their second wicket. Very good! Come on! They've made only 8 runs. Beautifully played by Rohan ... ... and that's 4 runs! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Brother ... fielding! No, no, no, no! Wait! Wait! Go back! Go back! Howzzat! Howzzat! Catch Mohsin! Howzzat! Buddy. lt seems that your players ... ... are in quite a hurry to return to lndia! The umpire has asked for the drinks to be brought on field. l'll just be back. The required run-rate is now 15.18. Rohan. Excuse me. Buddy, you're also really weird! Why don't you stop me? l've grown so old and yet ... ... like a child, l insist on things! l don't understand, Dad. What's there to understand? These dreams, this winning ... ... it's all madness, buddy! Some dreams are never fulfilled! Even if we lose this match ... ... what's the most that can happen? And it's due to this match that your mother has come here. l took advantage of the situation ... ... and flirted a little with her. And the amazing thing is, she didn't mind! Don't lose heart, buddy. You came here, that's the biggest thing for me. And you tried to fulfill my dream of winning this match ... ... that's an added bonus for me! Your coach will never ask anything of you again! Not my coach ... ... but my Dad can ask, right? l told you, Dad ... ... even today, you come first for us ... ... and everything else after. The match isn't over yet, Dad. This dream of yours is meant to be fulfilled ... ... and your best player is still ... ... in the team. Tell your player to get ready. Thank you. Child ... ... now both our dreams are the same. Don't waste any more time. Go and make our dreams come true! This isn't mine ... ... it's Rohan's decision. So forget your worries, show some heart And shout out hadippa! So forget your worries, show some heart And shout out hadippa! Short paced delivery. He's lifted it into the air towards the fielder ... ... and he's dived and caught a brilliant catch! The Pakistani Champs are now on the threshold of victory ... ... and it's impossible for the lndian Tigers to win this match. 165 runs in 10 overs ... ... and only 1 wicket remains. Now only a miracle can save the lndian Tigers! Oh, come on! Come on! Don't believe for one second ... ... that l'm doing this for you! l'm doing it for my Mom and Dad ... ... who, for the first time today, are sitting together in the stands! You used me to fulfill your dream. Today, l'm using you to fulfill mine. lt's simple. l know that you're not doing this for me ... ....but l am doing all this only for you. There is only one God. His name is the Truth. He is the Creator. He is without fear. He is without hatred. He never dies. He is beyond births and deaths. He is self-illuminated. He is realised through the grace of the True Guru. Repeat his name. He was True in the primal beginning. He has always been True. He is also True now. Nanak says he will be true forever. So forget your worries, show some heart And shout out hadippa! So forget your worries, show some heart And shout out hadippa! So forget your worries, show some heart And shout out hadippa! So forget your worries, show some heart And shout out hadippa! And with that, captain Rohan Singh has completed his century. What an amazing display of batting! The match is just an excuse. The idea is to wipe out all the differences ... ... whether it's done by crossing over borders ... ... or over chairs! Right, buddy? Come on! Only 13 balls ... ... and the lndian Tigers require 28 runs to win. Will they be able to grab victory today? Veer Pratap Singh has cut the ball ... Come on, ball, ball, ball! ... and started running to get a single. Oh! Veer Pratap Singh has fallen while taking the run! lt looks like he's hurt his arm. Medical! Oh Sir, how will he play? His arm is broken now! l've only broken my arm. l haven't lost my life! l'll play! All the best Veer! Go for it! Only 2 overs left and lndian Tigers need 27 runs. Well done brother, well done! 1 1 balls, 27 runs. Oh God! Veer Pratap Singh is looking disturbed. lt seems like his injury is making it difficult for him to play. 10 balls and 27 runs are still required. Very good brother, very good! Keep it up! Well done, well done! Well done brother, well done! Maintain this line! With every ball, the pressure on the lndian Tigers is mounting. Only 9 balls remaining and 27 runs required. Yes, yes, yes. Go, go, go! ... and running, he has taken a single. 8 balls and 26 runs remaining. Beautiful shot! Amazing timing by Rohan! Yes! Yes! lt's the last ball ... ... so we'll have to take a run. Aatif, you also come closer. Not one single should be given. Yes. No, no, no, no! Back, back, back! Veer Pratap Singh was nearly run out. No run was taken. Shit! 20 runs are required with only 1 over remaining. This is the last wicket remaining for the lndian Tigers ... ... and looking at the state that Veer Pratap Singh is in ... ... captain Rohan Singh is aware ... ... that the responsibility is now entirely his. The tension is building. Veer Pratap Singh is standing ready with his spirit intact. The last over will be bowled by captain Ali Ansari. Yes, yes, yes! Go, go, go! And suddenly, both the batsmen had the opportunity to run a single. And Rohan has lofted that over the wicket-keeper. That wasn't a copy-book shot ... ... but it has gone over the boundary for 4 runs. 15 runs required and only 4 balls remain. The pressure is immense, for both the teams. And it's a 6! With these 6 runs, lndian Tigers have completed 200 runs. 3 balls and 9 runs remaining. Yes! Go, go, go, go! l want two. Come on! No, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait. This time, the lndian Tigers will have to be satisfied with a single. That means, Veer Pratap Singh will have to face the next ball ... ... and he is finding it difficult to play. You've always said ... that you're a world class batsman. Show them today. Catch it! Veer Pratap Singh has sent the ball flying over the fielder ... ... and the ball is speeding towards the boundary for 4! What great batting! All the spectators are amazed at the shot he just played! Come on! Come on! Come on! Her entire life she's been devoted to you! Today, make her dream come true! Come on! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Keep going! Keep going! Come on, boys! So forget your worries, show some heart And shout out hadippa! One more, Veer! One more, one more! So forget your worries, show some heart And shout out hadippa! How is that, umpire?! Not out.

Setting everybody right at Tihar Jail ... ... is Kiran Bedi. Forget the jail. While running her country ... ... what stone did lndira Gandhi leave unturned? She fought like a man She was the Queen of Jhansi. But she was a woman, right? Nobody told them no entry for women. So if there was no discrimination there ... ... then why here? Whilst this discrimination remains ... ... in every other lane, a Veera will become a Veer!
