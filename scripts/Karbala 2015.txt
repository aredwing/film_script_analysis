Watch it! Throw it back! What's this? Anger... OK. Did you read the chapter about relaxation yet? There is this sentence in it: Relax in the shower. We went to the chaplain and asked if he read that? And if he did, whether he accepts it and how are we supposed to do it? And the chaplain says: Son, I didn't read it because I swapped it with a raghead for a skin mag!" - The chaplain said that? - Yes. You can ask when we land. Hey, maybe something from Arabian Nights?" ls something up? Ashura. Galica! Couldn't get enough sand? Why so pale Captain? The clab? - Did you bring the clear booze for Easter? - Colored. Take care of the loading. - Kisses from my old lady. - Where? Wherever you want. Private Kamil Grad. Assigned to recon company as medic... Go see Corporal Malericzuk, help him with the loading. Fine, fine, you can report when you buy me a round tonight. Load this on the truck. Waszczuk, aren't you going to say Hi to your brother'? What the fuck is he doing here? Mother will say I convinced him to come. - They didn't send the night vision goggles. - But ifs calm' Dickheads. Whafs with the photos? They can sell it on eBay. - Galica, you still owe me. - Fuck, four'? - Five. - Here's five. Next time I meet one with a camera, I'll make him a deal. Deal on what? You fill out a report and sell il before the contingent changes. This crap is not worth sending back. Hey, you're not going to rat on us, are you? You don't have a cousin in CID? Looked like you a little, snooping around here. Hey. So it's true? He's family, look at that mug! You know, when Fabisiak was coming back from Chad, about family. So, he's back from Chad, wants to surprise the wife, comes home at night. Sneaks into the bedroom and sees four feet sticking out from under the blankets. Two male and two female. Grabs a barstool and starts fucking beating on them. Beats them till he's tired. Walks out and in the hallway, his wife says: did you meet the in-laws, Dear'? Family, man! Nine oblock! Go, hit it! Contact 11 o'clock! Get out! Galica, get out! Can you make it? - Can? see anything! - Get out! - They're on the other fucking side... - Take position on the right.

Contact at 11! We got one wounded in Fourthfl One from SecondDGa/ica. Galica is dead. Was there a situation like this in the Army? Charges of cowardice? It's a precedent. Like our presence in Iraq. Captain, we know in general what happened today. We're waiting for your report. Your report will serve as a basis for investigating the case, of the soldier assigned to your company as medic, Private... Kamil Grad. Captain? The circumstances were... difficult. They were firing from a number of directions. But it was possible to carry out the order. The medic was taking fire and he should have carried out the order. Do not speak for me, Lieutenant. The report will be ready by tomorrow, General. Captain! You're my immediate superior, I'd like to know... The medios insubordination, according to you, should not be mentioned, right? It won't bring Galica back to life. Ijust want you to know that in your place I would have issued the same order. Your situation assessment was accurate. Would you get the wounded out at that moment? The commander gives the order and the soldiers are to obey it. We can't have pansies watching our backs. They have to be eliminated. And people need to know about it. So now, theyTe making up for this holiday. Fuck, Easter will be fucked. Farid, why didn't you buy it? I know you're forbidden, but we aren't. So, how do you like Guantanamo? Everybody likes to look when they come here for the first time. Private, go report to the Chief! Yes, Sir. At the request of Captain Kalicki, the prosecution will accuse you of not aiding a wounded man and of refusal to obey an order. How much time can I do for that? Not aiding is article 166 of the Penal Code up to 3 years of imprisonment. Plus refusing to obey an order - article 343 of the Penal Code, up to 5 years. Pl83$8 write YOUF statement. I request to testify in the presence of my superiors, I am entitled to that, right? I will not be made into a scapegoat. You can put yourtestimony in writing. There's a recommendation that you do not return to base with the other soldiers but remain here. Just don't treat this as if it was jail, please. Day before, there was shooting, yesterday was the funeral. Today is a break. How is the painting coming? So, just pay for it. Don't worry about it, that's why l'm here. Ifs cheaper over here. Gosia. It cost 35 dollars to build the bomb that blew up 10 Yanks yesterday. NO, I'm not trying to scare you but you're whining about the price of some frigging paint and that is completely unimportant. YES. That's how I see it, but I'm not whining. Fine, well, tell the kids that... No, don't tell them anything. OK, see you. Bye. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10... Fuck! Fuck! OK, shut it, let him concentrate. - Sergeant, may I ask for the ball back? - You call your brother Sergeant? Ask me by name, I have a name, don't I? Man, I have a name. Well? Sergeant, may l'. Ask for the ball back? This is the Army, not a circus. Fuck! - You can't even stick up for yourself. - Fuck off! Wanna say something? Fucking ball... Why are you fucking with him like that? We had a different deal. He wasn't supposed to come. Leave her alone! - Don't have any. - Give me one. Whafs with the parade? Big Brother has business. What, is something up? No idea. Fuck that, we've got to catch some sleep then. Let's go with the boards. Give me another one. I need another one still. And wrap it with tape all around. Stop cutting, stop! Stop here. Ours or ragheads? Ragheads I think. Dismount to secure positions. Roien, Tiny, you're with me. Fuck, check it out. Get out of here, now! Lieutenant, make the shift change then report. Hi. - Bulgarians here? - Yeah, they showed up an hour ago. Their commandefs name is... - I can't remember but it ends in -ov. - All their names end in - ov. - How many ragheads on duty? - About ten stayed. Is it calm? Calm? Calm like in Karbala. These Bulgarians are special ops. They gave you commandos for body guards. - We'll see you tomorrow in Lima. - So long. Not too long ago, I could talk with you in Russian. But, in the end, it doesn't matter. Big Brothers code still stands. Only the Brother has changed. Officially, for 72 hours. And unofficially? Captain, Sir'? Some son of fight downstairs. Captain, he jumped Malehczuk and started a brawl. OK, enough. Corporal Malericzuk, what happened? Lieutenant Sobariski, to your duties. And you go back to your cell. Want them to lynch you? Why me and not orderly Malericzuk? The order to aid the wounded was not for him? Did anybody even ask him why he did nothing then? There was nothing we could do. You want them to escort you by force? Captain, until I leave, please allow me to do my duties as per my contract. Last night I saw the local policemen run away. That officer, that one, he saw it too. You're going to need all hands. Give me a chance, please. Farid. Waszczuk. Escort the Private to Lima. Great, its starting already. Look at them. What do we do? Should we take them on? Orwhat? - Drive slowly. - They know they can fuck with us. But until they start shooting, all we can do is smile at them. Keep going- OK, get moving. Enjoy Iraq, Private, you're getting transferred to HQ in Babylon tomorrow. Can't see much from behind the walls there. So there won't be many heroic tales at dinner for you. - One hero at home is plenty, huh? - Fuck! Guys come here because they have mortgages. Heroism... Fucking 9l0W~ You're all fucked up in the head. I don't know what you're talking about, Sergeant. When you call Mother, you tell her how your brother looked out for you. Fucking loser. You think that when we tell you this is not a beach, we mean fashion? Private Minta thinks so. Get up. Show us your arms. It's nice and even here. In the field, you will tear up your arms. Thafs why we wear BDUs, not t-shins. Lieutenant, thafs enough. Walk the positions upstairs, l'll stay here. Yes, Sir. Get yourself fixed up. What are they doing? How do you like the Middle East, gentlemen? There is a guy in the street behind you with a boom box. He's got our frequency and is listening in at the checkpoints. Go back a block, tum left, then right and go around. But be cool. No hurry. Take him out discretely and then haul ass to Juliet. - But our orders are to go to Lima. - You might not make it. Juliet is in the city and the Yanks are nearby so it's relatively calm. Good luck. Reverse slowly. Clear! Cover us. Let's go. Tum this shit on, Roien! Coyote 4, changeover in 15, whats your situation? It's quiet, empty. Whafs for dinner at Lima? What? Learning Polish? - Waszczuk, pick him up! - I got him. And where the fuck is he going? Waszczuk!

Stay calm! - Open fire? - Do not open fire without orders! We'll send our contact to the other side to check the status of our missing. D0 you think theyTe still alive? You either make money on a soldier or you use him as a living shield. So either we negotiate their release or the other side will bring them to you as shields. Take care, Captain. Keep your heads down! Get down! Sobahski!!! Don't open fire without orders! Fire! Fire on the pickup! Fire on the pickup! RPG! Come with me! They're retreating! - Fox 06, this is Fox 04. - Fox 06, over. They're pulling back. The square is clear. I see that. Over. No casualties. At daybreak, the enemy retreated. Enemy casualties? Between a dozen and a few dozen killed. Fox 06 thank you. You will be relieved as ordered. General... Sir. We request to join the company. Volunteer. But you just got back.

Dina, serve the meal' You don't have to, thank you. The city's been brought under control, but the infidels are holding on in City Hall. Let them withdraw and you will get City Hall in your hands. You don't understand. We must seize City Hall together with the defenders and punish them as an example Therefore I am talking to you. You should get them and help our people free themselves. To that defended fortress? Wonder how? Don't wonder, find some way. In the end, you were with them. They trust you. We also trust you. Your family is safe. That is also some kind of wonder, don't you thing? We must help our brothers in City Hall, so that they could help us from the inside. So if City Hall does not surrender this night, we will come lo ask you for help. Good girl. Good bye. Captain, will they relieve us tomorrow? If they don't, they'll take us out by helicopter.
