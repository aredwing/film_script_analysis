That is why I solemnly declare that our party will undertake drastic measures so that we can finally oVercome the desperate situation you are in. Because you are the ones that work and the ones that pay taxes in order to sustain us - the rulers, the government, the army, and even the king himself. This means you are the masters and we are your servants. The people needs servants, not masters. The taxman's coming. Asparuh Kanchov! - Yes, sir! Have you received tax notices? Why haven't you paid? A writ of execution has been issued against you for delinquent taxes. And another one on behalf of Kuno Benov. You borrowed money from him and did not pay back. I'm taking your cow. Bring it out! Go away. Don't come close. Purko! - Get off! Purko! Please, Purko! Empty the house then. You haVe a wife and kids, too. Put it off. Don't do it, please! GiVe us some more time. But if you don't pay by St. Demetrius I'll take everything you haVe. I'll strip you naked. Bay Linko! - What is it? Nothing, nothing. Have you brought an egg? - No. Do you want a drink? - No, not now. Bay Linko, I was just... It's nothing much... I'd like to start some kind of trade if you would become my partner. Who? - You. What kind of trade? - Well... The profit will be handsome but I need you. How much? About 500 or 600 leva. You have yourself a deal. But you have to pay me back your old debts. Are you praying for your debts, Purko? Pray, child. Prayers help. I need it badly, that's why. What else an I do? You don't need it. I'll give it back when I get back on my feet. What are you doing here? Where did you get the money for the eggs? Damn pestilence! - Button up a bit. Do you know how much the price of eggs will rise? The citizens haVe gone crazy drinking yolks. The paper said that in America everybody's eating eggs. Easy! Whose turn is it? - 30 eggs. Don't break the eggs! How many do you want? Wait, please! How many do you want? Keep your calm. There is enough for everybody. Here you are, sir! Take it easy. Sir, please! - I just want 10 eggs. Keep your calm. 100 eggs?! Damn pestilence! What? No! Get out! Get out this minute! Don't do that!

Semiautomatic ragcutter. I'Ve patented it even in America. I hardly manage producing them - One, two, three, a rag. Once more, more rags. I produce traditional rag-carpets.

Could the food be flowing out the rear? Take it out for inspection. - Go in if you dare. Go on! I say we discontinue the inspection of the incident. This animal may look like a pig but it is a suspicious character of a type unknown around here. It is a pig. But it grows as big as an elephant. Then feed it. Don't let it scare the Village again.

Oh, the American girl. - That's right. You should have said so. Just a moment! Hey! - Don't you... Hello! Are you going to bed? I brought the money for America. Oh, yes! Oops! Cheers! - Oh, yes!

I haVe serious doubts about this. Why worry? He is paying, isn't he? - You're right. Cheers! - Cheers! Hot meatballs. Please, haVe some! You put too much bread in the mince. Be careful! There is a lot. Or you won't sell food in the pub. Isn't that right, Mr. Kanchov? And what about the wine? You dilute it with water all the year round. And you think we don't feel the difference. It's not true, Mr. Kanchov. That's pure grape wine. I even sell it at a disadvantage. What can I say, Bay Linko! Cheers! That's life for you! Give us a speech! Give us a speech! Dear co-villagers! Today our dear guest is Mr. Kanchov. He is our new member of parliament who will now give a speech. Bravo! - We want a speech! Dear... Victims... Our party... Drastic measures! The roads. Taxes... The monuments... The government... And the soldiers. Motherland Bulgaria. The king. The wine. You are the masters. The people needs servants, not masters. Is that you, Purko? Kuno, you are looking for trouble. And be more careful with the people that work for you. Be careful in what respect? Pay them regularly and let them go home when the sun sets in the evening. Wait! - Don't do this! Battle has begun. Hearts are beating fast. Here at arm's length are our enemies at last. Courage's what we need now, courage's what we need. We are slaves no more. Today we're breaking free. Mr. Kanchov! Mr. Kanchov, the day has broken. Mr. Kanchov, the bill. I haven't ordered anything. It was you who... - What do you mean you didn't order? You're dressed as a king but you have no money. I never said I had. You said you were a gentleman. Take this off. Strip, I said! I'll show you. Strip!
