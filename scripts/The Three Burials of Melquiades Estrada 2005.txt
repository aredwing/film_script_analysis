Come over here, Sparky. lt's a good thing you can do something else. l think my horse needs water. Where'd you come from? Coahuila. What are you doing in Texas? Looking for work. What kind of work? l'm just a cowboy. Hey, Perkins. Here's the stuff that your friend had on him. -You know who they are? -That's his wife and kids. -Any idea how to get ahold of them? -Well, they live in... ...Mexico. Can l keep this? Yeah, l guess for a while. We're gonna have to do an autopsy on him. When you get through, l want you to give Melquiades to me. -Hell, l can't do that. Are you crazy? -No. l'm not. Gotta go. -All right, see you tonight. -Come back early, though. l get real bored here. Haven't you made friends with the neighbors?

The deceased died of a gunshot wound of an AR-1 5 .223 bullet. Entered 2 inches left of the sternum between the fourth and fifth rib. lmpact caused a lung to burst. Severe hemorrhaging. Took 1 5, 20 minutes to die. l would estimate he died seven days ago. The trajectory indicates that the shot was fired from 300 yards away. He was gunned down. Listen, bud, we need to bury him now. Refrigeration in this dump is broke, and l gotta be in El Paso tomorrow. -Okay, bury him. -l need to notify his relatives. He ain't got any. Two-one-seven, clear. Three-five-nine, clear.

Alto, goddamn it! Run, run, Mariana! Take her. Stay down, bitch! Stay down. -How many got away? -Three. Well, somebody's gotta pick strawberries. You were way overboard there, boy. No, sir. Fuck it.

He's a good Mexican. Pete, you been cooped up in here for two days. You need to get outside and do something. What's that to you? Brought you some jerky. l found these shells... ...out there where Mel's goats was on the loose. They was about 300 yards up the hill. They might mean something. You ladies fine?

A little bit. -No way. -I saw you together-- -You're my red-hot mama. -She's pretty. She's prettier than me. She's free and happy and has red hair. -Stop it. -I'm not stupid, Johnny. I've got eyes. She'll wreck your life and mine and hers. That's what will happen. This is ridiculous. You're throwing your life away, Johnny. Don't do it. Please don't do it. I need you. I love you. Please. You see, right there. That's exactly what I'm talking about. It's always the same. Always the same. Oh, Johnny. What's happening to us? We used to be so happy. Don't you remember when we were living in River Valley? Yes, doll. I remember River Valley. We were happy then. And we'll be happy again. I know it. Please, don't cry. There will always be a River Valley for us. I hope so, Johnny. I hope so. Thanks. You're getting to be a regular customer around here. Well, l don't have a lot to do right now. Let's go. Come on.

Always the same round? AR-1 5, .223 standard. Why? l was just curious. l always use the .30-30 myself. Lever action. Open sight. -Don't know what you're missing. -Eminem. That's all he listens to. Hello. Shit. Fuck. Fuck. How do we register him? Write down ''Melquiades.'' Melquiades what? Where's he from? Mexico. Maybe Coahuila. Cincinnati"s real pretty in the springtime. -There's lots of malls. -l bet you miss it. We're glad to be here. You know, wherever the job takes us. But this is different. Yeah. We were both real popular in high school. Now it just seems like we don't know anybody anymore. Well, living out here takes some getting used to, l guess. Yeah. l guess it does. lt must seem real different. Do you know where, like, the mall's at in Odessa? Sure. lt's easy to find. Hey, man. You okay? No. This working hours? Well, we're about to close. You need to investigate them Border Patrols that use the .223. Want me to investigate the Kennedy assassination while l'm at it? Before you bitch, find out what that fucker was involved with. Melquiades wasn't involved with nothing. By the way, we already buried him. l told you to notify me. lt seemed like you'd at least... ...notify me. You're not his family. l don't have to notify you. He was a wetback. -You like him? -lt's the best horse l ever saw. Take him, he's yours. Really, take him. But it's your horse. Mine, yours.... What's the difference? He's got ''Pete'' branded in his brain. No, he cost you a lot. Shit, don't even get off of him. Hey, Bob, how long we been married? Twelve. Hell, l don't know. What day is it? Relax. But the Border Patrol is everywhere. -lt's fine, man, don't worry. -Where are you going? Where do you think? To get the girls. Hurry up. Could l see some photo lD, sir? Girls, this is Melquiades. -Lou Ann. -Oh, Lou Ann. -Nice to meet you. -You work with Pete, right? -That's the one from the cafe, right? -Yes, genius. -But she's married. -So's the other one. Oh, shit. That's y'all right down there, 205. l gotta be back in two hours. Wanna watch TV? Watch television? Want to? l'm sorry. Music. Okay. Wanna dance? -You're not coming? -No, l'll wait here. -You've always liked the mall. -l'll wait. But l don't wanna hurry, l wanna shop. l will wait for you here. Don't smoke. l love this song. Crazy bitches.... l understand you people. Believe you me, l do. And we are not loca. No way. -Shit, what time is it? -6:20. Fuck. Bob's gonna kill me. -When am l gonna see you again? -l can't next week. -Sheriff's turn? -Stop it. You know how things are. -All right, no problem. -Hey, don't mix things up. You're the one l love, darling, only one. -Belmont's something else. -What about old Bob? That's different. Bob's my husband. You understand, right? -Bye, Pete. -Bye. Let's go. Hey, man. You okay? You bueno? You bueno? -How you doing, Sam? -Just fine. -Morning. -Morning. l need to talk to you about that dead Mexican y'all found. What about it? -l'd rather talk outside. -All right. lt's our new officer, Mike Norton. Yeah. Little prick. Apparently, he was out there on the Boracho Peak, okay? Shots were fired. And he returned. There was only two of them out there. Mike Norton, new kid from Cincinnati, and that wetback. Shots were fired? Who fired at who? He fired at him first. Now, l don't want any shit. -What are you doing here? -l need to talk to you. What about? -Belmont came by the caf today. -So what? Border Patrol by the name of Gomez came looking. So what? Gomez told him who killed that Mexican. Don't fool with me, girl. Hell, no. He told Belmont a Border Patrol killed him in a shootout. -Did he say his name? -Yeah. A guy named Mike Norton. -You heard him say that? -Said his name, like, three times. -What are they gonna do with him? -They didn't say. -What's wrong with you? Goddamn! -Arrest him. -Who do you think you are? -That fellow who killed Melquiades. -Who would that be? -That Border Patrolman, Mike Norton. -With what evidence? -You know damn well who killed Mel. l don't know a goddamn thing. You know damn well who killed Melquiades. You ain't gonna arrest him, are you? You better get out of here before l throw your ass in jail. You ain't gonna arrest him. Who is it? l'm here for Patrolman Norton. Captain Gomez sent me. Yeah, just a sec. You scream again, l'll kill you. Put your hands over your head. You got any handcuffs? -Yeah. ln my uniform belt. -Get them handcuffs in that uniform. Bring them back in here and keep quiet. Do what he says, Lou Ann. Put that uniform on and then them handcuffs. You tell her what you did? What did he do? He killed Melquiades Estrada. You need to try to relax. Might get cold. There we go. Now, if you call the police, l'm gonna have to kill him, darling. There's rain coming now through Cincinnati. We could be looking at heavy rain through the day on Friday... ...so flash flooding will be a huge concern in the tri-state area. Get out. You gonna kill me? Get out. Dig him up. -Who? -Melquiades Estrada... ...you stupid, gringo, son of a bitch. You killed him, now dig him up. Today's storm that swept Ohio... ...sent dozens of vehicles sliding on the roadways... ...forced hundreds of stores and businesses to close. Good news here is no one was seriously injured. Get him out. Get out. Get around here. Take him in the house. Sit him on that bed. Turn that light on. Sit down at this table. ln that chair. Melquiades lived here. That was his bed. Kept his clothes right over there. That was his plate. And that was his cup. Drink it. No. Drink from that cup. These was his work clothes. Put them work clothes on. Then put them dress clothes on Melquiades. The oldest is Elizabeth. She must be fourteen. And Yesenia is probably twelve. And this little guy is Aaron. He's going to be a damn good cowboy. And this is Evelia. Evelia Camargo, my wife. How long since you've seen them? About five years. Promise me one thing, Pete. lf l die over here... ...carry me back to my family... ...and bury me in my hometown. l don't want to be buried on this side among all the fucking billboards. l'll die before you will, l'm older. Promise me. We're here, right? Go down to Ojinaga and head south. Then turn east and follow the sierra until you come to Coahuila. Then you'll come to a town called El Toston. Between El Toston and El Nacimiento... ...there's a little place named Jimenez. lt's my home. Ask for Evelia, my wife, and explain things to her. l'll just throw you in the trash. You take me back to Jimenez, Pete. You promised. Come here. Sit down in that chair. l'll take them boots. Oh, shit! All right. Let's go. Oh, fuck. You fucker. What did he leave that uniform there for? Tell us he's crazy. What time did we find this guy's wife? About 9:00 this morning. Goddamn crazy son of a bitch, Pete Perkins. What do you think? l think the son of a bitch is crazy. Right now they should be somewhere here headed for Mexico. What about that heat-seeking radar y'all got? -lt don't work. -They found four steers... ...in a canyon on the Cross Bar diamond this morning at about 3:00. -What about rangers? -Told them we had it covered. Be over by today. Know what l mean? There's 1 000 ways he can go. That son of a bitch... ...is so fucking nuts he might head to Canada. We'll start with the Llano Largo... ...the Sierra Diablo and the Arroyo Negro. Where y'all going? The rest of the United States, l reckon. Due what? We'll head southeast over to Alarid Canyon. Where are we going? There's nowhere to go, man! We're not going up there, are we? Shit. Well, hell. This is Frank Belmont. What are you doing? l'm at work. Am I gonna see you today? Yeah, all right. Same time, same place? -Yeah, l guess. -Good. Stop at the store and pick up a pack of Kotex. Shit! Get out. Get out. Shit, shit, shit! What am l doing here? Well, it's our duty, sir. Shut up. Where are you going? He stinks, man. l can't sleep. Get back over there where you was at. Hey. Hey, you. My name's Pete. Well, Pete... ...the ants are eating your friend. Fucker. Goddamn! All right. Get down and don't try nothing. Who's there? l don't speak Spanish. What do you want? We're friends. Wanted some water for our horses. Well, help yourself, then. l like listening to this Mexican radio station. l can't understand anything... ...but l like the way Spanish sounds, don't you? Yes, sir. Sounds all right. Smells like something dead around here. l killed a deer a couple days ago. lt's starting to turn. Yeah? Well, you better throw it away. lt's rotten. l wanna keep the hide. You got any salt l could use to cure it? No, son. l barely got enough salt to put on the dinner table. You got any alcohol or anything like that? l got a jug of antifreeze. Would that work? Suck on this hose. Them ants won't eat him anymore after this. You're crazy. You're totally fucking crazy, man. Y'all come and eat! Let us pray. Dear Lord... ...we thank you for this meal... ...and for bringing me these friends and our daily bread... ...and all the animals and all the beast in the field. Amen. You live alone? l've got a son that comes and sees me every month and brings me food. But it's been six months since he was here. What do you live on? l got some things stored away. Thank you. -l'd like to ask you a favor. -Anything you want. l wanted to ask you... ...if you can shoot me. My son ain't coming back. Oh, he'll come back. No, he told me he had cancer. And he told me to go back to town with him. But l don't wanna go, because l've always lived here. Well, we can't do it. l don't wanna offend God by killing myself. lt's a problem. We don't wanna offend God either. lt would be the best thing to do. You're good people. You need to go ahead and shoot me. You know, l'm innocent actually. l didn't mean to kill your friend, man. He shot at me, all right? And l swear to God, really, if l could.... You let me go and l promise-- l swear. l promise l will not press charges. Where's that son of a bitch at? l don't know.

Fucking motherfuck! Shit! Help! Help! Help! -Good afternoon, sir. -How do you do? Sir, have you seen anyone coming through this area... ...or in this general area on horseback? Like, maybe two men? Horseback? Maybe with a couple pack horses or mules? l ain't seen anybody in 30 years. All right. l am sorry, sir. Have you heard anyone come this way in the past few days or hours? Are y'all cops? No, sir, we're actually with the Border Patrol. Ain't no Mexicans come through here. We're not looking for Mexicans. -No one come through. -Are you sure? Hell, no, l'm not sure. But l don't think so. Okay. Do you need anything? No. All right, we're moving out. This way, hurry up! Watch out. That's a rattlesnake. He's not gonna bite anybody. A dead guy! He's still breathing. -l think that snake bit him. -He sure did. -ls he a gringo? -He looks too fucked up to be a gringo. Has he got money? l think it's too late.
