Do you know where mom has gone? Do you know? Come over here. Did you miss us? We have been in school. He should be named something. I run a finger down the page - - Then you say stop. And it's not allowed to peek. - Are you going to say stop or what? - Stop ... What does it say? Ulla. He can't be named that. No, you don't want to be named that, do you? Jette Kp. Heide. Mette Helming. - But he's a boy. - Let's try again. - Say stop, goddammit. - Okay, stop. This is a good name. Look here. - That's very good. - We'll take it. In the Father - - And the Holy Spirit's ... spirit. - You say that? - Yes, now keep your mouth shut. We'll do it right. Like in a church. Where is ... Where is my vermouth? You have taken it, right? You also took my fags, right? Nick, give me my vermouth. You drank it all. - What? - You drank it all. Look, she pissed on the floor again. She is so disgusting. Nick? - Do you think he is sick? - No, he just needs sleep. Do you want some food? I've made something for you. Are you sleeping? Wake up ... Wake up. Wake up. Wake up, dammit. Wake up. Wake up! No! No! No! Hi, Nick. Nick, it's Sophie.. I made coffee. Nick ... What the fuck ... - What is it? - Just get in here. He had spiky hair. He was so sweet. I want a lot of children. You can't even look after the one you have. - Relax. Of course I can. - Do you ever see him? Relax. You don't need to be so angry all the time. - Don't you need a haircut? - Knock it off. Do you want me to get you to relax? Don't you want to lie down? You can lie here. - You are welcome to sleep here. - No thank you. - You never want to sleep here. - See you. - Hello . - Hide and seek - Hello... - Who is it? Hello? - No, not you again. What do you want? - You are noisy. You've stayed at this hostel for five months, right? - So what? - We are nice to each other here. - I am asking you something very simple. - You do not ask me anything. Goodbye. Huttelihut. I have asked you to turn down, so I can sleep. - Right? - Yes. Turn off the radio, and do not trample around as if you own the place. It's Sofie. - What happened to your hand? - Get out. Leave me alone. Do you understand? Hey ... Hey, Nick. Come here. - Ivan? - Please help me. Damn, man. What happened? I just looked at their car. And accidentally touched it. And then they totally freaked out. Fuck, it hurts, man. Shall I come and look at your car again, huh? Are you an idiot or what? You can get some more, if you want, man! Listen... Do you want more beatings? - No thanks. - Then shut up. What happened to you, man? Have you become a punching bag, or what? - You collect bottles? - This is my bag! What the hell are you doing, man? Come on, let's kill them! Ivan, they are gone. What the hell are you doing? Let's kill them. Come on Nick, let's kill them. I'll kill you! Stop them! I was at this hospital in Hvidovre. They didn't understand a damn thing, man. - They just gave me pills. - Pills for what?. It was like, I have not seen my father for ten years. He is still in Serbia. I've been waiting for him. So I tell them: "Don't talk about my father." Then everything goes wrong, man. And then they threw me out. - What about your mother? - My mother? My mother died. We buried her three weeks ago. Was your brother there? Yes, of course. I thought you were in jail. - Were you released, or ...? - Of course I was released. - Okay. - I came out three months ago. Have you seen my sister? No. What were you in for? What happened? - I don't remember. - You don't want to remember. My sister threw you out, and for a whole week you went berserk. You beat up someone. - Eat, I have to go. - Calm down, Nick. Want to hear something weird? I couldn't taste salt for a whole week. No matter what. I drank a lot. Then there was this guy. A complete random. I knocked him down. Hard. Do you still have that A? Ana. She doesn't want to see me anymore. My own sister. - Why not? - It's a little blurry ... Sometimes I get so ... What do you mean it's blurry? She was asleep at my mother's home. So I though I'd lay down beside her. Like when we were kids, right? And then I ... You know ... - Fuck it. - Did you touch her? No. ... I didn't mean to. - That's sick, Ivan. - I know. I think about it all the time. - Have you ever had sex with a girl? - I have fucked many. Not really. I get sad, when you talk about that. I'm sorry. I try to think of something else. So don't start it. I try to think about cars. I look at cars to think about anything else. Some big, wet tits - - And a butt that rubs my belly. - And sperm on her face. - Okay, fine. I get mad. I also think about things that aren't normal. Ivan, calm down. I get it. - Now, don't start crying, alright? - I don't. - I've missed you like crazy, Nick. You were like a big brother to me. - How long has it been? Two years? - I have no idea. - I think it's two years ago. - Is it? Come here, Nick. I've missed you. You should sit in my kitchen with my sister, eating crackers. - Do you remember? - Yes ... I know what we need to do. - Good evening. Welcome. - Thanks. My friend lvan needs a suck 'n fuck. Sorry. Sorry ... I bought a sweater for you. Hey, Ivan. Put it on. I followed a girl once. I wasn't going to do anything to her, Nick. Ivan. What then? I just followed her. So she went into this building, and I slipped in before the door closed. I just wanted to walk past her. Past her hair. Just smell her, you know. Just when I'm about to pass by her, she turns around and looks at me. Then she begins to scream and scream - - And I can't handle it. So she got one on the head, man. And then I run down the stairs. Away. I wasn't going to do anything to her, Nick. I just wanted to ... ... sense her. - What's up? - He's staring at my lady's ass. - You are drooling over her, man. - If she didn't want people to look, then ... - Then what? - Then she wouldn't act that way. - Mind your own business, cheese doodle! - She's standing there with that ass ... What are you playing at, man? No, stop! - Let's go. - What are you doing, man!? Idiots! What the hell is going on, man? - What's happening? - It's not me. It's Sophie. Because according to child psychologists at the municipality - - it is important that children have contact with their biological mother. Bent! Put your shoes on, dammit. You can wear shoes, just don't to stomp around. - Hey, what's going on here? - Hey, Nick. This is my son. This is Nick. - Say your name. - I don't want to. Well, his name is Tobias. How did you get hold of him? Mom, I'm hungry. We'll leave soon. Then you'll get some food. Just play some more. - Is dad coming soon? - No, he comes little later. I'm leaving. See you. Bye. - Who is it? - It's me. - What is it? - Can you help us? - With what? - Can he stay with you for two minutes? There has been a misunderstanding. The police are here. - And? - I'll come back. It's just two minutes. Sit down. Here is a little messy, but ... Did she just pick you up or ..? No, he's not. Just take it easy. It'll be over soon. I don't know. He is in kindergarten, I assume. Do you want to go home to your father? I can walk by myself. Hi. This is Tobias. I think it's him, you guys are looking for. Come, we'll go in here, darling. You know what ...? Stop it That hurt! Let go of him. Now! Do you hear? Release him! You have dialed - - 23 52 01 44 Please leave a message. Hi, this is your big brother. I would like to get hold of you. Hi, Nick. Are you drunk? Haven't you slept yet? Are you sleeping? Yes. - Explain to me again what we are doing. - I want you to see her, Nick. Whose car is it? - If it's another girl you've followed ... - Calm down. Wait and see. It's Ana. It's her birthday. Ana took a pregnancy test - - and it was positive. I said I wanted to have it. But that was apparently the wrong thing to say - - Because she left me. She got an abortion. That was it. Fuck, that's a long time ago. Do you want to have children? With her I wanted everything, man. I think you would be good at taking care of a baby. Here you go. Thank you. Then she took a magazine and began beating her. - Then she ran out. - That's so far out! She didn't come back out, but ... She was just little fatty. - So you were glad? - Yes. Do you think I'm cute? Just tell me if there is anything you want me to do. - Want to touch my breasts? - Yes. Should I just ...? Yes. Let me help you. Do you want me to help you? Have you never tried it before, Ivan? It's okay. It's pretty sweet. You can touch further down, as well. - Can you tell that I'm wet? - Yes. I'll leave for 10 minutes. Hello. I want my brother's address. I have a phone number. Who are you? I'm looking for my brother. He lives here. There's no one home. He hasn't been home for a few weeks. I hope nothing happened. He was so sweet, your brother. And that sweet little Martin. - Is something wrong? - No, no, I ... I've never seen where he lives. I've removed the ads. So no one can tell that he isn't home. If you see him, tell him to call me. - If he shows up, okay? - Okay. Thanks. Ivan! Hi, Nick. - What are you doing? - Nick? You must stay out here. It's not so good in there. What the hell are you talking about? Stop ... No, stop, Nick! What's going on? - Ivan! - It was just because ... Suddenly she began to scream. I wanted her to stop. Ivan! I can't do this anymore. - Hey, honey. - Hi, Dad. What are you drawing? Me and mom. And me in a Zorro costume. - Are you ready to go home? - Two seconds. Now. - Did we forget lunch again? - Yes. Sorry. - Then let's go buy some food, okay? - Yea. Dad, I want toast. Okay, toast. But something healthy, too, okay? - Do you want to steer the cart? - Yes. Here's flour and browning. - Is there anything else you need? - No thanks. - I owe you. - It doesn't matter. Keep it. - Are you doing your homework? - No, I am drawing. - I'm still in kindergarten. - Oh yes. Can you look after him a bit? I have to go to the toilet. Thanks for the information. You are good at that. More colors. Then it would be really good. What about a green Yes, and what about a man there? Now you just watch. That doesn't look like a space rocket. - It took a while. - Yes, okay. Want some food? No thanks. I 'm leaving. - Thanks for the help, Vrle. - Okay. They say that you pick him up too late, and he seems tired and aggressive. He doesn't sleeps well at the moment. He is thinking of his mother. Martin's mother was run over two years ago. Both you and Martin's mother were substance abusers? - Have you started taking drugs again? - No, not at all. - You don't seem to feel good. - Oh ... Okay. - I think it's the flu ... - I don't think you understand the seriousness. We have begun a process - - Which may end with a placement of your boy. It will be assessed if you are able to take care of him. Okay. - Shall we say that's it? - Yes. And regarding cash assistance ... Just forget it. It's okay. You can get three days' advance. Just one more thing. I don't care about anything else other than my boy, okay? - Dad, I'm hungry. - Okay. Sit straight and watch a little television, okay? Dad has to go to the toilet. I want something to eat now, Dad. Okay, I'll make you something. It's okay. Just go to the bathroom. Okay. Sit here. Take off your jacket. I'll be back in a minute. Okay. Come here. Let's sleep in daddy's bed. You can't lie on the floor, okay? Come, Martin. - What is it? - Come. Yes, okay. What? - Look ... Zorro. - Yes! Good, huh? Fuck! Hello? Who? Yes, that's my mother. How is she? Okay ... Okay. What time did she die? Yes, try. I don't know how to get hold of him but you can try. Yes. Yes, fine. You're welcome. - Honey, you'll have to go in by yourself. - What are you doing? Dad is busy. Go now. - You're picking me up, right? - Of course I'll pick you up you. I always pick you up. Now go. Martin, take this. Here. Yes. Martin, your father is here. Hi, Dad. I'll go find Martin's clothes. - It is a drawing for grandma's coffin. - Come. Look at it. Come on, Martin.

You can eat some from Hjalte's again. - No. - Yes. - Yes, Martin. - No! No, I won't eat his food! - You fucking have to! - No! I don't want to anymore! Martin ... Come on. Come here. Calm down now. - Let me go! Stop! - Come here. - Stop. - Calm down. Easy. Come on. Come here. I know. I know. I know. I know, sweetheart. I'll think of something, okay? - Hello. /I - It's home help. It's not the day, for my home help. Lizzy Holm? Then it's today. Hello. I'm about to make lunch. Want some food? No thanks. Are not you hungry? Do you want some to go? What are you doing? - You are insured. - You can't take my stuff. Do not take my wedding rings! - Where is your money? - I have no money. I have none. - Where is your money? - I have no money. Tell me where the money is Otherwise I'll break your legs - - and leave you. Put it there. Good. - Hey, Nick. - Hello. It's my older brother, Nick. Can't you say hello? - Hello.

And you get to walk out the door. - And we don't see each other again. - Can't you just count them here? Easy. I know the money is there. No one's trying to cheat you. People are just nervous if there's a lot of money around. It doesn't look good. And you'll only sell in the city, right? - You have a little boy? - Yes. Why are you doing this? - To make some money. - For your boy? And then you get caught. What happens then? I won't get caught. Elias and Kalle, don't run on the stairs. Hi, Martin. - Is that your father? - Yes. - Mona. I am the new intern. - Hey, Mona. Nice to meet you. This is the sheet with participants for our colony. - Is Martin going? - To the colony? We have sent some letters. - Maybe we sent them to his mother? - Martin has no mother. So I usually get the letters. But I haven't seen them. - She was run over by a road hog. - I'm sorry. We are doing very well on our own. Right, Martin? - Do you want to go to the colony? - Yes, if I'm allowed. Obviously you are going. Right? Sure, I am! - Yes, he'll go. He would like that. - Good. See you. Bye, bye. Bye, Martin. - Who is it? - Wait a minute. - Hello. - We are going to play hide and seek! Hello. Who is it? Hello? I don't know. Hi. Take care of yourself. Be good. Give me a hug. Off you go. Are you excited, Martin? Me too. You can look after me. You can sit next to Malthe. I'll call you every night and say goodnight. Bye, Martin. See you. - Dope. - What do you have? - Very good dope. - Shut up, what do you have? - White Thai. - Don't know it. Is it good? Okay. 200. Come on, man. The same as yesterday. Damn. Stop a minute. I've 400. I have 400 for you. Is it good stuff? You're new here, right? Take it easy, man. If it's decent, I'll come again. The Ghanaians are too insane. - Okay. See you. - Yea, fuck off. - Got dope? - How much? You can't stand by Central Station. They only sell pills there. You need to go further down the street. If you want to sell. You really have the goods, man. Where are you from? Around. - Are you nervous? - What for? It's not like you hear a click on the phone. They aren't that stupid. You get that burning sensation in the back of your neck - - When you walk in the street. That's the one you should listen to. It is as if someone is following you. But you can't feel it if you are fucking nervous all the time. It's really good dope. Where does it come from? You ask too much. I'm going now. - Wait a minute. - I'm leaving. - If you follow me I'll beat you. - Relax, man. I'm an old school teacher, man. I'm no cop. You are all worked up. You need to get someone to sell for you. You're bad at it. - He's helping with the cooking. - Okay. Martin, your father is on the phone. Here he comes. - Hello, darling. - I found some amber. - It's white, but it's amber. - Okay. - We're eating now, Dad. - Okay ... - You hang up first. - No, you do. - Okay, we do it at the same time. - Okay. I'll count to three. One, two, three ... Carsten. - Jimmy says you can sell. - Yes, yes - And you're not bullshitting? - No, I don't bullshit. If you have good dope, I can sell a few grams a day. You cover the losses. - If you screw me over ... - I don't. - There are ten packages here. - Okay. If it's full of money later, we have a deal. - At two o'clock. Not a minute later. - I'll be on time. - Get lost. - Bye, Carsten. He has been an addict since he was 14. He knows the game. He knows how he to sell, and where to sell from. And he's fast. He'll make you and your son rich so you can travel around the world. Dammit, don't you want that? So say thanks to Old Yellow instead of being angry. Yes, yes. Thanks, Yellow. Thank you. Whatever. See you. - Kindergarten, it is Mona. - Hey, is Martin there? He is playing soccer - - So you'll have to talk to me. That's okay, isn't it? Fine. You'll remember to teach Martin how to ride a bike, right? - What should we teach him? - How to ride a bicycle. That's now a problem. But let's talk a little first. Okay. We eat in a minute. Tomorrow I will teach you to ride a bike. I don't want to. I'll fall for sure. Of course, you want to. I'll take tomorrow off and teach you. Mona will also be there. So she can help you. Is she your girlfriend? Mona? No ... Would it be okay if she were? I don't know. You know what? You start school next summer. No, I won't. I will only go to kindergarten. - Why don't you want go to school? - I just don't. You have to go to school some time. Come here. Look, it's not dangerous. And I'll go with you the first day. I'd rather learn how to ride a bike. I don't want to go to school without you. Okay. Off you go. - I dreamt about mom yesterday. - What did she say? Not much. Do you know where she told me that we were expecting you? - At the zoo. - At the monkeys' cage. At the monkeys' cage, yes. I can feel her looking down at us. And smiles. I feel it too. I love you, honey. I love you. Money first. Why do I need to say it. For 500 - Hello. - Hey, you old bag. How is it going up there? It's crazy down here. - Should we get a beer afterwards? - Yes. / I - We'll talk in an hour. - Alright. And Yellow? Thank you. - Hello. - Run! Run as fast as you can! Carsten is a snitch, man. Get rid of everything and run! Hello. My name is Ulrik Hansen I am your defence counsellor. I'm in a hurry, so we'll have to keep it short. You haven't told the police anything yet? What happened? You are supposed to have strangled her? With that? Is anyone I need to contact for you? We'll meet again soon, Nikolaj - - And then we'll have someone look at that hand. We're here to talk to you about Martin. You have been allowed to call him. He is doing okay under the circumstances. I know it can be difficult to talk to him - - But it's best for Martin, if he knows where his father is. He should know that you're okay. Do you want to talk to him? Yes. Hello. Martin? It's Dad. - Hello, darling. - Hello. How are you? - I don't know. - Where are you? On a farm. Dad, when can I see you again? I don't know. It'll probably take some time. - Are they treating you well? - They have rabbits. Rabbits? Really? I miss you. I miss you too, honey. But it'll be okay. Martin? Are you there? Don't cry, honey. I can't help it. - Is there anyone who can comfort you? - Yes, but they are eating. - Just go and eat, okay? - Should I just go? Of course. I think about you, my big boy. Bye. - Are you hanging up? - No. - You hang up. - No, you do. Okay. I count to three. Then we'll hang up together, okay? One, two, three ... Bye. Hey! Brother? Nick! - You look like shit. - So do you. - How long have you been here? - Three weeks. Where's Martin? I don't know where he is. - I've been thinking about you. - You too. I wanted to have a proper talk with you. Or just see you more. I tried to call. I don't think it was our fault that time. You were a good big brother. You did what you could. And I did what I could. What's going on? Are you alright? - I get off here, Nick. - What? - It's about time. - What? What did you say? Brother? - Take care of yourself. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute, man. What happens to Martin? Brother! Let me talk to him! Brother! Fuck! Let me outta here! Let me out! Hey! Brother! - Is Nikolaj Torp here? - Yes, just go inside. Nikolaj, how are you? I have some juice for you. How are you? I can still feel my hand. It's all a bit strange. I don't know what you are doing. The doctor can testify that your hand was useless at the time of the murder. And two hands were definitely used. I don't know who you're hiding - - But you shouldn't take the blame for a crime you did not commit. Is there anything you need? Yes, I would like to see my brother. I saw him at recreation a few days ago. He is also in jail? I was not aware. Wait a minute. I'm going to make a call. What? Your brother is dead. They found him yesterday morning in the bathroom. It was suicide. You have to tell me the story. Okay. Hi, Nick. Hi, Ana. What happened to your hand? I removed your tattoo. - You have a kid. - Yes. Alexander. - Cool. - He can only cry and sleep. It can be hard with a little one, crying all the time. Have you seen Ivan? If you see him, tell him to stay away. What happened? Just tell him. I have to go now. It was good seeing you. Take care. - Hi, Martin. - Hey, Nick. How are you? I don't know. No. I don't know either. What happened to your hand? It fell off. - But I'll get by, don't you think? - Yea. D'you want to accompany me? Okay. - Hello. - Hello. - Hi, Martin. - Sit down here. I would like to sit with him. I am Martin's uncle. Can he sit with me? Come. Let's sit here. - We were sitting here the last time, too. - What? - I was sitting here the last time with my dad. - That's right, yes. Afterwards, I'll tell you why your name is Martin. He also has one. What? Dad also has one, so we can find each other. - You say that? - Yes, now keep your mouth shut. We'll do it right. Like in a church. Are you ready? In the Father - - - And the Holy Spirit's ... ... spirit. We dub you today ... ... Martin. Yea. In the Holy Spirit - - your name is now ... Martin.
