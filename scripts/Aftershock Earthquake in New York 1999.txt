The yanks are in baltimore this evening for a three-game series With the orioles And the mets travel to los angeles To begin the first of four in dodger stadium. Turning to the weather Under blue skies, we'll have a high of 65 degrees Dropping down to a low of 48 overnight in manhattan. Currently, it's 52 degrees at central park 54 at jfk and 51 degrees in newark. As for the traffic, the f.D.R. And the westside highway Are moving well with only light congestion so far. The manhattan bridge is also in good shape With the williamsburg and the brooklyn Experiencing some moderate delays. The holland tunnel is still jammed As a result of the surrounding construction So you're better off taking the g.W. Or the lincoln tunnel. The b.Q.E. And the bronx are, as usual, a nightmare. Alternate side of the street parking rules are in effect And buses and subways are running with only minor delays. Wcbs time is now 6:54. Now for the headlines: The war of words between mayor bruce lincoln And fire chief thomas ahearn escalated yesterday When ahearn submitted his formal resignation. Asked for comment The mayor said he would take time To consider ahearn's early departure But hoped discussion of issues could now continue "without disruptive elements impeding progress." The developers of a westside high rise... What's the matter? I think low rider doesn't feel good. He doesn't want to eat. Try this. Oh, danny, no, no. Huh... What is it?

Originally los angeles. Ah. Let me guess. You got tired of all those palm trees. Well, it's a long story... Keep the change. Stop. One would think that by the time you'd been accepted By the new york city ballet You would understand that art requires discipline. Miss agostini, there are many others Waiting in the wings who would love to be in your shoes. Understood? Shall we continue? I'll make summary remarks, then we'll just have to see. You all right? Anything I can get for you? You've done a great job, miss lincoln. I know you've done everything you can. Joshua... There is still time for a last-minute plea bargain. Involuntary manslaughter. We could negotiate for time served. No, miss lincoln. We haven't come this far To admit to something I did not do. There's a risk. What you're doing... Well, if it's a risk to tell the truth Then that's what we have to do. Now's not the time To start doubting ourselves. I trust you. Okay. ( music playing ) Danny, would you turn that down? All right, saute the mushrooms, add onions and herbs And melt butter. Danny! Please turn it down! Thank you. All right, reduce one cup of wine. Do I have a cup? ( rumbling ) Danny! What is it?! What happened? I-I don't know. I thought we were having an earthquake. Chill out, mom. We don't live in l.A. Anymore. ( rumbling and rattling ) Man ( whistles ): Taxi! Taxi! In other news, manhattanites experienced A series of small earthquakes today Measuring from 2.5 to 3.0 on the richter scale. There were no reports of damage or... ( knocking ) Seismologists say the tremors were centered In the battery park... Hey, roberto, what's up? Diane, you've got to get out now. There's a gas leak. The fire department's here. Now! Excuse me. We're headed entirely in the wrong direction. ( heavy accent ): Do you think? Yeah. Gracie mansion, that's behind us. That's a good start. But we're going uptown. Up! Please, not to worry. I'm not worried. It's just that we're going to be driving an awfully long time If this is how... I have a confession. I don't know where this crazy mansion is. Gracie. Gracie mansion. All right. Whatever you call it. I don't know where it is. I don't know where anything is. I should never have taken up this line of work. Complete mistake. Okay. My mistake. Okay, okay. Hang on a minute. I should sit back there. You should drive. How about this? You drive And I'm going to tell you how to get there, okay? Okay. ( sirens wailing ) Company 51. You must be bruce summerlin. That's right. Chief ahearn. Oh, I know who you are, sir. Man: Hey, chief... We're hanging in there with you. You put the mayor back in his place. No, don't hang in there too tight. It's one thing to fight city hall It's another thing to win. Doesn't matter. You're taking care of your own. Sir, I've got a gas line rupture Somewhere in this building. Probably in the basement. Yeah. 100-year-old lines, they blow from time to time. Where are you? We've got the building evacuated But we're still waiting for utility To shut down gas and electric. Yeah. Well, it's chilly out. Most of the windows are closed. You've metered the explosive limits? We're smack in the middle of it. Best we could do considering our response time. Gas is pretty strong. You'd better deploy ventilation equipment. Well, yes, but without con ed Killing electric at the pole We're risking an explosion. I don't want to get my men hurt. Nobody wants your men to get hurt. But somebody's got to make a decision soon. Okay. Let's deploy this equipment and air this thing out. O'leary, get that fan installed. Nickerson, mcauley, you two go in. Let's open every window in the place. Man: Get back! Get back! Are you all right? Are you all right? Now, breathe easy. Just breathe easy. Oh, my god. Hank, I'm so sorry. This never should have happened. The building was empty. We should have waited For con ed to cut off the power. It was a bad call. It was the right call, summerlin. With all due respect You've been sitting behind a desk for a long time. I admire what you're doing for the department But you should keep your fire fighting to city hall. Hey! Get those lines over here! Cabbie: Is it your home? Evie: It belongs to the city. The mayor lives here. The mayor? You know the mayor? A little. I'm his daughter. No! Well, this is very something. I will introduce myself. Nicholai karvoskya. Evie lincoln. Nice to meet you. How long you been in the city? Three months. Three long months. Don't worry. It only gets better. See ya. ( horn beeping loudly ) It's about time you got here. Nice to see you, too. I like this. Well, let's say it shows off the best and hides the rest. Which is most of me by now. Grandma... Man: Now here's a sight For sore eyes. My two favorite women in the whole world. Always the politician. You're right, mom. You're right. Aren't mothers Always right? Ladies and gentlemen, mrs. Lincoln, my mother. ( applause ) And ms. Lincoln, my lovely daughter. ( applause ) And dinner is served. Shall we, ladies? Daddy. Evie, I understand you have an upcoming meeting With bickerton, craig and coleman. How do you know about that? I was in law review with bickerton. He called me. Daddy... This has to be on my own merits. If he's looking for city contracts... Take it easy. Take it easy. Stop selling yourself short. Last time I looked, you were the star Of the public defenders' office. Just not sure if I want to work there. Maybe... I'm not ready. Nonsense. Big paycheck, big office... You deserve the opportunity. Look at your track record. It's not just about winning. It's not? Well, of course not. That only matters in elections. Seriously now, this bingham case... It's a long shot. I'm going to have to win it in the closing. Then it's a good yardstick. I think this is why I don't call you As often as I would like to. Well, sometimes you need to hear what I say. I'll make a deal with you. Win the bingham case, take the interview. Mom. You've worked hard enough for it, eva. Deal. Deal. That's a deal. Give it up. All right. That's my girl. ( phone ringing ) Hello? Dori: Hi. Hi. I just wanted to talk to you. What's up? You're going to think I'm crazy Um, but I think I felt A tremor today. Oh, dori, don't we have enough to worry about? Why are you always so quick to get angry? I'm not angry. I just don't know what to do anymore. Your every waking moment is now devoted To protecting danny from some kind of disaster And when there isn't one, you create it. It's like an obsession. You're wrong. Danny is healed. He will never be the same. And you won't let him. And this isn't about danny. It's about you. Dori, it's been two years. What are you saying? You still feel responsible for an accident. Dori? Take my hand, grandma. Why are you always trying to treat me Like I'm some antique? You know, grandma There are buildings with doormen and elevators. And people to chew my food, too, I suppose. No, eva, this is where my life is Always has been and always will be. I am not moving. Grandma. I worry about you. You're not getting any younger And besides, home is where you make it. Lawyer talk. You haven't lived long enough To know what home is. It takes family, friends and time, baby. Good night. Stubborn! Love you... ( door creaking open ) ( sirens wailing ) You haven't said a word All morning. Anything wrong? No. School going all right? Fine. Except for the fact that everyone looks at me Like I'm an alien, but... Okay... It has been in the paper Every morning for a week. Dad, how could you let it get like this? Christine, there wasn't really much I could do about it. If the mayor is so stupid Then why is it that you had to quit? It's too complicated to explain. You don't want to know. Yeah, I do! Okay. The mayor has made decisions That I think hurt the department. He's rerouted money And now we're short on equipment and training And that is dangerous For everybody. Honey, I didn't mean for it to go public. It just got away. I'll find a different job. But you used to love your job. I mean, now all you do is fight with people And it's ever since you and mom split up. Now that's not true! It's... It's true that the divorce has been difficult But it just... Just got away. ( door closing ) You know, dad... It's not everybody who quits their job Just to insult the mayor. Yeah. I showed him, didn't I? Yeah, wham, right in your own kisser. Hey. Who would have known an alien could be so beautiful? Bye, dad. Evie: The murder of madeline bingham A helpless invalid Shocks and appalls us deeply. Our reaction is to lash out and take revenge. But our duty is to do justice. The prosecution has illustrated nothing but The weakest case of circumstantial evidence. I ask you to examine it. You will find no facts can be forged against joshua bingham. In a few moments, you're going to go back to that jury room And I don't know what's going to happen. I do know the room is small, windowless... Has one door that will be closed. Imagine it gets locked And you're in there for the rest of your life... Because we think you might have done something wrong. You're talking about a man's life. There is no room for any doubt. No one truly knows what happened in that room. Joshua bingham is a good and innocent man. Hey, I was thinking... I'm not busy today. Maybe I could stop and get that pele video you wanted. What do you think? Yeah, sure. Danny... Don't be so enthusiastic. Dad said he'd pick it up on his way home. Oh, okay. Is something wrong with you and dad? No, danny. Your dad and I are having some tough times But we still love each other And we're just adjusting to the big move and everything. What do you mean by "everything," mom? Danny! Don't want to be late! Morning, danny. Mrs. Thorell. How are things at home? Fine, thanks. And for you? Fine, thanks. ( truck rumbling ) ( church bells ringing ) Man: You're crazy! Oh, no. I'm not crazy. I'm mad. What did I ever do to you? You lied. Wait a minute. I think you're a little confused, noname. You're not doing anything to me You're doing it to yourself. And take that thing off your head in here! Yo, I'm telling you You've got me mixed up with somebody else. You're getting all over my nerves now. 'cause that sure don't sound like the me I know. Well, you just keep kidding yourself, hear? Wait. Yo, I'm telling you you've got this all wrong. Yes, I got this all wrong. You came in here last week Begging for a job. Playing on everybody's sympathy. You got me so sucked in I made a plea for you to the pastor. "he's a nice young man," I said "from the neighborhood. Just trying to make a little pocket change." You really think he's going to remember who the hell I am? I do. I loaned you $20. I didn't take no job! Listen, you asked for the job. You got the job. Now, do the job. A man is only as good as his word. Look, my word is good enough on the street. Now hear my word. If you ever try to get over on me In front of my pastor You will be the sorriest young man That ever lived. Now sweep. Has the jury reached a verdict? Man 1: We have, your honor. Judge: What say you? Man 1: We find the defendant, joshua theo bingham Not guilty. ( doorbell tinkling ) ( chuckling ) Hi, baby. Hi, dad. Nice suit, that's new. How can you tell? I can tell. You are such a creature of habit. You get the same thing every time. Uh, maybe I should order you something else? Oh, actually, I don't have time. How's ballet? It's fine. Choreographer's still picking on me. And of course you don't deserve it. Absolutely not. Honey, you have talent and opportunity. If you don't want to work at a job Why don't you work on dancing? Yes, sir. So, the usual? Oh, I hate when you say that. If history serves You'll have an incredible story For why this is necessary. You're making fun of me. No, I'm not. This is my favorite part of this whole ritual of ours. Now, come on. I'm waiting. My apartment building blew up. What?! Yeah, it did. Gas leak, boom! Oh, diane, your life is complete chaos. I know it must seem that way From your ordered and organized life. But it's not that crazy. ( tears paper ) All right. Thanks. I'll be staying at a friend's. I'll let you know the number. Why don't you stay with us? Because then we wouldn't meet For these lovely little lunches. ( chuckles ) All right. Here's cab fare. If you see your mother, spare her the details. She'd only worry. And take care of yourself. I promise. All right, honey. Bye-bye. You're my hero. Love you. Hey... Hey! Get in. Where to? 88th and fifth, please. Is that a map? Yes, but no problem. I know the way. Big streets, no problem. ( inhales ) ( exhales ) New york air never tasted this good. They say the best things in life are free. Well, all I know is I wouldn't be here Without you, miss lincoln. They believed in you, joshua. I don't know what to do to thank you And I don't want this to sound Out of line or anything But could I buy you lunch? Thanks. But I have an appointment already. A big law firm wants to offer me a job. This may be my last case as a public defender. Big changes. Yes. And the question is, do I want them? Are you afraid to get what you want? Maybe. Don't be. Don't let anything stand in your way. If there's something good out there for you, take it. What happened to my mild-mannered accountant? ( sighs ) I just want you to get everything that you want. You deserve it. Thank you. Take care. Okay. Cheers. Dostrovya. ( phone ringing ) Hello? Woman: Daddy! Hey, evie. What a pleasant surprise. I'm making good on our agreement. I only have a minute But I wanted you to know I'm taking that meeting. Congratulations. How does it feel to be moving up in the world? I have to admit, it feels pretty good. Mind you, I didn't say I'm taking the job. I just want to be sure. Sir? Jerry palnick. Hey, evie, I'm sorry to cut this short. I just got another call. I have to take it. Can I call you back? Well, I have to go on the subway, anyway. Maybe later? Okay, sweetheart. Listen, be yourself at that meeting. Tell me all about it later. Okay. I'll call you tonight. Okay. I'm heading uptown, do you care to join me? Lead the way. ( labored breathing ) ( weakly ): Thanks for coming. Oh, yeah. Wish there was something I could do. I'm sorry. It's just... Bad luck. Yeah. ( apparatus rattling ) May I take that for you, miss? Thank you. Except for a slight limp, my son recovered completely. Dori's consulted every specialist in new york But, uh, there's nothing more they can do. I am sorry. Don't be. My son is amazing. He wanted to be a soccer player Play in the olympics. But he's decided he's going to be the coach. Was she driving? Yes. She was blind-sided on the passenger's side. Guy ran a red. Was she hurt? No. But it hasn't been the same between us since then.

( yelling ) Look out! ( car horn blaring ) ( tires screeching ) ( ceramic shattering ) ( people shouting ) ( metal screeching ) ( people screaming and shouting ) Do you read me?!

( gasping and gagging ) ( passengers screaming ) ( metal squealing ) Come on, get up! Hey! Hey! Come on! Get up! Get up, come on! Come on, get up! Come on! You're cut. It's all right, I think. Is it over? ( screaming ) We're still alive. ( gasping and coughing ) Come on, come on, come on. There you go. There you go. There you go. Low ride... Low rider! Low rider! Come here, sweetie.

You hold on, daddy. I'm... I'm so... So glad we... We saw each other today. I'm glad. Daddy, don't talk like that. Who do I call when everything goes haywire, huh? Diane... I'm so proud of you. ( laughing weakly ) Oh, dad... I brought a dancer into the world... A beautiful dancer. ( coughing ) ( choking ) Help! ( loud rumbling ) I'm sorry. No! Do not be shocked by what I do, please. Diane: What are you doing? Oh, no, don't. Just leave him alone! Get your hands off of my dad! In an hour, your father's shoes will Be gone, his coat-- whatever he has. Gone! All of it.

I think he's dying! Let me see. ( wailing continues ) No... No! No, no, no! No!! Shh, okay. Backup lights came on. ( woman crying ) ( knocking on door ) ( woman screams ) Hello? ( radio static ) Joshua: Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello? He's alive. There's nothing to be done. No, no, we have to try to help him. Joshua: The man is practically dead, evie. How do you know? The way he's breathing. What? Evie, we need to focus. We don't know what we're up against But we do know we need to try to save ourselves And to waste energy on a dead man Would just be foolish. Okay? Don't worry. We're going to be all right. What if it's a nuclear explosion? Or maybe a bomb or terrorists. We'll soon find out. ( crying softly ) Let's get you out of here. Here we go. Mom! You got her? Ahearn? Get the paramedic equipment And get out there in the streets on foot. We have people down everywhere. Yes, sir. Got a radio? Right here, sir. Who's out there? C.B.S are going strong, sir. Those guys are on batteries. Ham radios from outlying areas still have power. Got a guy in queens says they've taken a hard hit. Central? One police plaza? Anything? No word yet. This is chief ahearn, fire station 15, what's your 20? Dispatcher: Chief ahearn I'm in the borough communication center, mid queens. I can't raise central dispatch in manhattan But I am in touch with a helicopter overhead. All right, patch me in. This is fire chief ahearn. Do you read? I read you. This is jillian parnell, reporter for wcbs television. Ahearn: Jillian, are you airborne? Roger that. We're airborne. We just watched the whole damn city shake apart. I'm downtown. Where are you? Right now we are flying southwest Over the manhattan bridge or what's left of it. I cannot believe what's happened down there. Oh, my god. Look at the brooklyn bridge. Cables have torn loose. I mean, they're-they're all over the roadway. The cars are just piling up right now. Jillian, I need you. You're my eyes up there. Now calmly tell me what you see. I don't even know where to begin. Jillian, just keep talking. The better you describe what you see down there The better we can respond. All right. Right now, we are swinging north over downtown. I see the twin towers. They look good. They're both still standing. Empire state building looks good. Chrysler building looks like it's okay But some of these buildings have just lost their skins. I mean, I mean, they've just fallen off. Ahearn, are you still with me? Uh, yes, I'm here. Have you been over upper westside? We made a pass earlier. Grant high? Honestly, I can't tell you that. I mean, there was so much... I don't know. Do you want us to go up there? No, no. I want you to turn around. I want you to fly over one police plaza And tell me what you see. Roger that. Ahearn: Dispatch? Man: Yes, sir? Uh... One police plaza Should be implementing their disaster plan. Have you picked up any transmission On the emergency frequencies? Negative. Not a word. Ahearn, you read me? Ahearn: All right, jillian, go ahead. I am flying over one police plaza now. It is destroyed... Completely destroyed. City hall? City hall looks like somebody dropped a bomb on it. Chopper pilot Do you read me? Loud and clear. I want you to set down in the parking lot Next to station 15 And look for me. Yes, sir, but you better pull some strings. I can lose my license for a stunt like this. Ahearn: Don't worry. I'm tight with the mayor. ( patrons murmuring ) What's going on? Arteries to and from the city are completely devastated. The streets appear to be nearly impassable, blocked by debris. Brick facades have tumbled Into a lethal storm. Many of the older buildings Have just simply collapsed or pancaked. We have to assume That there are many, many people trapped among the ruins. Our information will become clearer... I got to go. Excuse me, folks. We ask for your prayers... Prayers for those who are still alive. Nice landing. Welcome aboard, chief. Where to? Central park. Try sheep's meadow first. ( footsteps ) ( moaning softly ) Church would have paid you. You owe me two hours' wages. You had a job. If you worked, you would have gotten paid. I got to eat. Besides, look around. Ain't much of a church left to sweep. Damn! ( chuckling ) You're following me. No. Yes, but not like that. Look, I appreciate it. You seem like a very sweet guy But I don't need you to follow me. I'm going to be fine. But I help you find your mother. I don't want your help. Go on! I mean, you must have somebody Of your own to worry about. They're probably looking for you right now. No one looks for me. I got to go. Bye. Oh, god. ( woman crying and yelling ) What are you doing here? What do you want? I remember map. I help you get there. 88 and 5th. Why do you care? I save your life. You save mine. I lost my earring. ( loud bang ) Oh! My daddy gave it to me. ( sobbing ) I remember times like this from before. To survive is good, but it is not enough. You understand what I say? You want me to go? I don't even know your name! Nicholai karvoskya! Could you spell that? ( sobbing ) K-a-r-v-o... I'll teach you how to spell it. ( laughs ) Oh, my god. Look at grant. My daughter's somewhere in there. Take me down. I don't have kids, okay? I'm not going to pretend to know how you feel. My kid's down there. I know! But from what I've seen You might be the only person who knows what to do... For everybody. Okay, central park. See if we can find the mayor. ( electricity snapping ) They never had a chance. Listen to me, everyone. We can't worry about the people In the rest of the train. There's nothing we can do. They're all dead. We have to check for survivors. There's nobody but us. ( banging ) Help! Let's go get 'em. ( laughing ) Hey! Hey, what are you doing, guys? You're just making it worse! Chill, lady. What you think You're doing, huh? Think you're a cop or something? All right, take what you want, okay? ( glass breaking ) What are you doing? You cannot stop this. I'm sorry. I don't mean to... People become like animals. They take and they don't care if they hurt you for it. And we just let them? For somebody's jewelry? What are you, crazy? To stay alive, in one piece. That is what is important. Maybe you're okay doing nothing But I'm not. Okay. Can you imagine what I feel? I travel across world to america And now I must think the same way I did Where I had to run for my life? ( glass breaking ) I just think it's wrong. Me, too. Good luck. I can't get this to work. Try this quick-start menu card. Man: We don't know yet. Look, con ed is working on the grid But it's safe to say over 90% is down. You're breaking up! I can't hear you! Here's a disaster plan in from gracie mansion. Have you got anything that can run it? Okay, okay! Up and running! Any word from emergency management yet? Emergency service units are on the way With briefcase satellite hook ups. Man: We've got three transmitters up and running. That's a start. Joseph, check with the f.C.C. About radio transmission. Make sure we work on the appropriate frequencies. Where's mark ross from emergency management? Well, somebody find him. We're going to need him. ( garbled radio transmissions ) ( helicopter whirring ) Mayor. Are you aware Of the damage at one police plaza? I am. You and I have a dilemma. You're the ranking officer of both fire and police. But I have your resignation on what's left of my desk. Consider it withdrawn. Should we put aside our personal differences? This situation doesn't allow for personal differences, mayor. Agreed. Until further notice, I have not accepted your resignation. By tomorrow night This place will be running amok with feds, fema The army, navy, you name it But right now the city is on its own So we've got to hold the fort. Streets are blocked. Engine companies can't get through. But we can get crews through on foot To pry people out. Contact public works. Locate earth-moving equipment. We have to clear major highways and streets. We barely have communications. If we don't clear the streets We don't deploy search and rescue. You got that? All right. You heard him. Let's do it. Your family all right? My daughter may be under grant high. Yours? My mother is missing And my daughter is somewhere down in the damn subway. Okay, here we go. Bert, be careful! We got you. Nice and slow. Thank you. Okay, let's move out. Hey! Who put you in charge? Well, I don't want to stay here and die. Do any of you? My vote is we move on and find some way out of this. He's probably right. Pretty cold, though. You going to be all right? Yeah, I think. Are you okay? Yeah. I thought once we quit gambling that, you know... ...Our luck would change, huh? We should have taken the bus like I said. Hello? Is anybody here? Yes. I don't know where to begin. Everything is broken. I lost my contacts and I can't see a thing. If I could just find my glasses Then maybe I could find my shoes. Come on in. The elevators don't work and the stairs are dark. I think we're marooned up here. I have an extra flashlight With batteries. You can have that. Thank you. What is it you're doing? This is earthquake survival stuff. You're from california. Yeah. I've been here about a year. It's really just, you know, essential stuff. And you should have these band-aids for your feet. I'm alice. Dori. These are size six. Will that help? Uh, that's close enough. I'm not going to complain. You're going to need socks, too. Thank you. You are so organized. What do you do? I used to be an interior designer. Really? I love what you did with the place. You should stay inside. There are bound to be aftershocks And the debris and the glass from the buildings Will fall into the streets. But you're leaving. I have a son. I have to find him. Of course. Doing something is better than doing nothing. I have a little dog. His name is low rider. If you find him, would you take care of him? He's hiding, or... Or he got out or something. Thank you. Wait! I can't go back in my place. I have to come with you. I can't stay here alone. I don't think that's possible Given my general state of anxiety. Please! Okay. ( creaking sounds ) ( water dripping ) Anybody there? Hello? Help! Please turn around, sir. No one proceeds unless on official business. I've got official business. My family's in the city. I'm sorry, sir. No civilians past this blockade. How am I supposed to get back to manhattan? There's a 90-mile-wide perimeter Around indian point nuclear facility. We're awaiting word on whether to evacuate the entire area. Manhattan is off-limits to any and all civilian traffic. You're saying there's no way to... ( honking ) I'm sorry, sir. But if I were you I might try some fishing. Thank you. Five alarm in chelsea from a break in the gas line. That would be companies 11 and 27. They can't travel, either. Even if the streets were clear There's no water pressure. Hmm... Utilities, give me an update. Uh... We expect to have the gas supply to the city Shut down and depressurized In two hours. Okay. Water pressure's down in too many grids. There's a break in the main line We need to find it. Patch me through to companies 11 and 27. Yes, sir. And give me a phone that works. Okay, as far as we know Incidents of looting and mayhem are sporadic. Yeah, well, that'll change. Trying to get a reading on how many beat cops There are on the island. And we're checking to see if queens is in any position To give us a d.S.U. Truck. I don't know how We're going to get it here. Well, you'd better think of something. This is company 11, go ahead. Okay, hand carry if you have to. 11, I want you to roll hose down 8th avenue All the way down to west 14th. 27, link up. Go all the way west Until you can draft from the hudson. Roger that. I need a fire boat. Pier 59, chelsea. Mayor, I need those streets cleared. You heard the chief, logistics. Henry, I want the bulldozers From all the construction sites in new york city On the street within an hour. Mayor, white house on the satellite phone. Mayor lincoln. My mom is not going to be able to cope with this. We will find your mother. Yeah, but... How do I tell her about my dad? You will find a way when the time comes. Who are you? Me? I am nicholai. I know. Diane, it could be long time to find drinking water. Better save. How long is long? Don't know. I'm sorry. You're right. I wasn't thinking. Ladies and gentlemen Washington just declared us a federal disaster. Fema, urban search and rescue teams Will be arriving at floyd bennett field in brooklyn And taken by helicopter to manhattan. Let the tv crews know Where they'll be landing. Whoa, wait a minute here. I got damn near 16,000 men out there. Now that's not counting your local emergency units Struggling with this thing right now Fema shows up and suddenly it's a photo op? You're out of line. Let me guess. This stuff replays around election time, right? For all we know, ahearn There'll be no city to hold an election. My point exactly. I'm calling for cameras Because the footage might give people hope. Hope! Because they see the entire country Mobilizing to help us. Elizabeth. Elizabeth, you all right? Yeah, as well as can be expected, I guess. Thank you. Take this. Thanks. No, I'm fine, thanks. How's mark ross? He, uh... Mark didn't make it, sir. Okay, okay, um... Look, you're going to have to take over emergency management. Yes, sir. This is chief ahearn, from the fire department. Pleased to meet you. Elizabeth perez. She's going to be director of emergency management. Elizabeth... I have every confidence in you. Thank you, sir. Sorry to see you under these circumstances. Would you like some water? Yes, please. From what I see out there We've got a lot of improvising to do. All right, let's prioritize. Okay. Injured-- Major hospitals will be on back-up generator With enough fuel for 48 hours. But there are-- thanks-- Lots of people lined up around the blocks already. Are there any streets clear yet? One trunk down each side of manhattan. Good. Um... Let's set up an outdoor infirmary Right here in the park. We can pull medical supplies from the nearby hospitals We can buses. We can get military vehicles to shuttle the victims. It'll be easier to dispense food rations, too. We've got to let fema medical assistant teams Know where we are. Oh, yeah. We've got to have a priority on potable water. Is there a curfew? Tonight, nightfall. Well, we've got to have access to a stadium. And we've got to, uh... Get as many refrigerated trucks as we can find. For the dead. Careful here. Watch yourself. ( loud rumbling ) What's that? I don't know. ( screaming ) Come on. We have to keep going. We've got to keep going. We just got a report of a 50-foot water geyser. Crew's on its way to cap it. That would be a trunk line right off the main. Exactly, uh... We're talking hundreds of thousands of gallons of water. And that's the only place it showed up. So, where's it all going? Right down... Into the subway. This station's been hit pretty bad. Doesn't look like there's any way out of here. There's got to be a staircase along here somewhere. No, it looks like they're all blocked. I'm really cold. What are we going to do? It'll be all right. We have to keep moving. Find an emergency exit. Another station. Something. ( gasping ) Man 2: This is supply airlift 3-7 About to leave area one right now. It looks pretty busy. Over. Volunteer team 31, south unit, please report to first aid. There's one more. No, I can't move it. Lincoln: Every time I come here There are more and more casualties. Well, at least we're getting them in. Sir, we have reports of flooding In the metropolitan museum. Joseph, look around you. People first, property second! Yes, sir. Joseph, have it cordoned off. And I want e.T.A.S for the national guard And para-rescue squad. Mayor, the governor's office Says the national guard's been delayed. Why, for god's sakes? Apparently, indian point nuclear facility felt the quake. They're assessing damages. If it's compromised They'll have their hands full Cordoning off half the state. I'll take care of that. Mr. Mayor, we can now transmit On a broad spectrum of frequencies. All right. The first priority is elizabeth perez And emergency management. Then begin broadcasting all available options For medical treatment and shelter for tonight. Any word yet on distribution of radios? Red cross has them at a staging area in new jersey. What good is radio transmission if nobody can hear it? Get them ferried over here and distributed! All right, people! I want updates, shelter, food, ops, logistics Medical infrastructure, 15 minutes, right here! Perez: We'll have medical collection points At every six-block interval. Who's talking to port authority? Yeah. We have well over 100 buses Earmarked for medical transportation. We're finding drivers, but the remaining problem Is the street. We'll worry about the streets being cleared. Just get those buses ready to roll. Okay. All right. Well, then let's move on to the armories. We're halfway between prince and eighth. Shouldn't be more than 20 minutes to get to eighth. I don't know. How can you be sure? I'm sure. But you can go back if you want. No. All right. You have any more questions? No. Great. Let's go! Oh! Hey. You all right? Uh-huh. Your friend is... Certainly enthusiastic. He's my client. Oh. So what is it you do? Public defender. Really? What kind of cases... What do you do? Account exec, bell atlantic. So, evie... Do you come here often? Oh, yeah, allen. All the time, all the time. ( chuckling ) Joshua: Hey, allen?! Want to see something that's really funny? Allen: Oh, my god. I'm not going to die in this stinking tunnel! I'm not going to die! Anthony: Take it easy! Take it easy! Please, you're going to hurt yourself! I don't care! Anthony: We all want to get out of here But we got to keep it together. You're not helping this. Bert: He's right. If anybody gets injured It's going to slow us all down. Nobody knows what they're doing! Following each other around in the dark... Joshua: Shut up! Would you please just shut up! I am doing my best To get us out! You're screaming at me like this is all my fault! Hey, buddy, it's okay. We all appreciate you leading the group. Who asked you? Nobody! Exactly! You been sticking your nose in everyone's business Ever since we got off the train. Joshua, what are you doing? As a young girl I was always Very self-conscious about wearing my glasses. I think I gave new meaning To the term "blind date." ( chuckles ) Funny enough It was my tempestuous relationship With my glasses that initiated my career. Come on, come on! Still not working? No. Oh, danny must be so scared. ( helicopter approaching ) How old is danny? He's nine. You know, I bet his teachers Are taking good care of him Right now as we speak. Yeah, but he's disabled. All the more reason why they'll look out for him. No, you don't understand. He's disabled because of me. ( sobbing ) I was driving... And I tried to pass And I was going too fast. And the truck, it just came out of nowhere. And there was nothing I could do. Now when I look at my son Any time he looks at me I feel like he's afraid to be with me. Hey. Dori... I need people to trust me, too So I know something about what you're feeling. I know I can't take your feeling away But I want you to know that From the moment I met you I trusted you And I felt safer. You did? ( laughing ) really? Are you kidding? I mean, the city is literally crumbling around us And you've still got it in you To take me with you. Woman ( on p.A system ): We will take you to a medical collection point for treatment. Please board this vehicle if you need medical assistance. We will take you to a medical collection point for treatment. Please board this vehicle if you need medical assistance. Alice... Thank you. Thank you, dori. Now go and find your son. Okay. Take care. Hey, what do you do, anyway? I'm a psychiatrist. ( laughing ) A psychiatrist and an interior designer? Boy, have we got our work cut out for us now, huh? First of the fema urban search and rescue teams Is lifting off from stewart air force base En route to manhattan. They want a destination. Man ( over walkie-talkie ): 10-4. Uh, we copy that. We're going to get supply seven To report to eight, four. Over. Grant high. Nicholai, are you sure about this? Yes, very sure. Well, I'm not. It's only one more floor. It's dangerous. I must go. Please, don't. Yes, of course. You wait here. I'll be right back. No. It's crazy. Don't go in. Oh... Used to be nice. Not much, but just beginning. Yeah. Why don't you get what you need. Let's get out of here. Yes. Is this a diploma? Yes. Moscow university. Mathematics. Here. Is that everything? Yes. Except for this. You sure? Yes. Sure. We go. Good-bye, room. Thank you. You should rest. I'm fine. Nora... If anyone shouldn't be doing this, it's you. ( grunts ) Hey, hey. I can get my hand through this opening. Let me see. ( water trickling ) What's the matter? It's wet. Oh, boy. Can I get a light up here? There's water up here. It's seeping down through the rocks. Linda: What does that mean? It means the water's above us. ( water rushing ) ( screaming ) Move! ( all yelling ) Yo, help! Help! Help! Can somebody hear me? Help! Earthquakes. Man, california stuff. Ah, damn! Out of all the ways I thought I might die Man, stabbed, shot, but never trapped Starving to death in a stupid church. There's a sandwich and a piece of fruit In that bag you took the money out of. I thought you were... Asleep. Asleep... With all that racket you've been making? You want some? No. I lost my appetite. Well, I'm not that hungry either. Damn, why they don't come looking for us? They don't know we're here. Gonna die 'cause you wanted me to sweep the floor. Noname. What's your real name? Real name? Come on. Where are your folks? You don't have no folks, do you? Damn. You talk too much. I was a nurse once. It always saddened me to see a newborn babe With no one But a total stranger to welcome him to this world. A person's name is supposed to glow With the love in which it's given. Nobody around then, nobody around now. I'm still here. We're in this mess together. Don't you know that? I don't know what god has in mind But it's sure something. God sure has something in mind. ( garbled radio transmissions ) Hey, lady! Get out of there! ( shrieking ): My baby! Fema! Am I glad to see you guys! I'm summerlin, engine company 51. Looks like you could use a hand here. We've got some preliminary shoring set in place But we've gone in as deep as we can without help. Well, if we can't give these people some answers At least we can give them some hope. Well, let's do it. May I have your attention? May I have your attention, please? My name is bruce ramsey. I'm the task force leader For this fema urban search and rescue team. We'll be deploying specially trained dogs Fiber-optic video cameras and infrared sensors. We'll do everything within our power To get your loved ones Out from underneath this mess. If your child is in here, we will find them. Now, please, please... Be patient and stay back so we can do our jobs. Ma'am? Ma'am! Curfew's been ordered. You have to get off the street. I got to get to my son's school. I've been walking all afternoon, please. Board the bus. It'll take you to a collection point Where you'll be safe. Maybe your son's there. No, you don't understand. I need to find my son now. I haven't got a choice! Orders are "everyone off the street until dawn." But what if he's out here on the street? Then hopefully, ma'am, somebody will find him. Hello! I'm looking for somebody who owns a boat. Kind of late for sightseeing. Actually, I, uh... Radio said they don't want no more people Going to manhattan. They got enough problems over there. I have a wife and child there. I don't envy you that. Look, if you don't own a boat Maybe you know somebody who does. Probably got coast guard patrolling all over. I'll pay whatever it takes, okay? When's this trip supposed to happen? Now. Ain't gonna get anywhere just sitting there. Go... Go... Go... That's good! This way, sir. Sorry, ma'am-- step to the shelter, please. Man: Once inside, please proceed to a registration table. If you have not already done so Please register at a registration table. Officer: Relax a second, okay? Officer... My son, he's nine And I don't know where he is. Yes, ma'am; it's easy to lose somebody In a place this big. No, he's not here-- he wasn't even With me during the quake. Where was he when you last saw him? He was at his school. And I think maybe he's still there. Now, I know that there's a curfew. Sorry, ma'am; can't go on the street Till 7:00 tomorrow morning. You can't bring that dog in here! No, he's a little boy. If I don't find him... I don't know... See that table over there? They've got a list of kids looking for their folks. Now, with a little luck Maybe he's already on it. Man: Transport, pick up at 8-5, please. What about you? Russian blood is very thick. Karvoskya, what's in the box? Uh... You don't have to tell me. No, no, I show you. This is my family. My mother... Father... Two brothers. Oh, you look just like your brothers. Like twins, only three. Where are they all now? My... Parents' Wedding rings. My brothers'. One each. Little brother's flight jacket. ( quietly ): What happened? In russia... There were many crises. Like this, only different. I'm sorry... I feel... I didn't know. It is the past. I miss my dad. I miss my mom. Everything I know could be gone. We will find her. Help her in her grief. I grew up two blocks from the guggenheim. My mother and I would visit once a month or so And then I got older and we quit going. I got too busy. What a shame. Do not think about these things. You count on your life going a certain way, you know? And then all of a sudden it isn't like that at all. Of all the things I could've imagined for my life I never would have dreamt of this. Maybe there is some good in having nothing. I got nothing to give but what I have inside And I have never had to say, "what a shame." Go to sleep. ( muffled conversation ) Man over p.A.: ...Please remove your vehicles from area six after you... Well, it's not exactly tavern on the green. Nothing a bottle of good red couldn't help, huh? Okay, what have we got? Well, um, we're barely keeping up with what's needed, sir. The problem of rodents spreading disease-- It's bound to increase The longer we're without sanitation. Not to mention bodies Decomposing in places that we can't get into. Ahearn: Some of the fires are still out of control. We're rerouting to build up pressure in the affected areas But I think we're going to gain from now on. Man: Priority message from fema, ms. Perez. I'll be right back. This is patched in from the state department. He insists on talking to you. Mayor lincoln. Listen to me. I've got thousands of new york citizens Trapped under what were once their homes and offices Not to mention thousands of kids Under the wreckage of their schools! The u.N... Yes, the ambassador... Yes, I understand. Priorities? Priorities are mine To call, sir. And that I will continue to do Until they haul me out of here feet first! Man! Everyone thinks their crapola Is most important. I don't know. Maybe it's unavoidable. You know, we all get caught up in our roles. Renegade fire chief versus big city boss mayor. I called you things And I never even knew who you were. I believe you called me An opportunistic con artist. I regret that now. I called you a moron. Said you didn't know The difference between fire and smoke-- Among other things that didn't get printed. That statement reflected more on me than on you. The job does get in the way sometimes. My wife's been dead over a decade. But I can still see her face in my daughter's. If anyone's kept me human, it's been her. You were right about me, ahearn. I'm a politician. By nature an opportunistic con artist. But it was my family who raised the bar. Set the standards for me to live by. I may be left with very little when this is all over. But I thank them that I can sleep at night. You and me, we fought Over money... Pride. Damn, I wish we could have done better. We will. Man: Chief ahearn! Search and rescue teams at grant high. They've found some survivors. Well, what are you waiting for? It's freezing. Well, at least the water's stopped rising. We'll be out of here soon. Come on, nora, let's keep moving. I can't go on. I have to sit down. Help him. He has a heart condition. All right. You got her? He hasn't been feeling so well lately. It'll be okay. I've been trying to get him to see the doctor. Hey, buddy, how you doing? Come on. Just a little farther. All right, buddy? Here we go. All right. Here you go. Thanks, man. Okay, here. I got you. Nora: Thank you. Bert, hold on to me. All right, take my hand. Come on! Reach up! Don't touch me! Never touch me. I got to go. I've got to find my mom. I got to go. They won't let you out until morning. I go get us some water... Okay? ( car honking ) I.D. Woman: Thomas! Thomas! I haven't see her. I'm scared. What if she's under all that? I'll find out what I can. You just stay here. Hold on to her, will you? My daughter... Uh, christina ahearn... Is she on that list? She's not on my d-mort list for the deceased, sir. But there's still some kids trapped inside. ( loud rumbling ) You can't go in there! My daughter's in there! ( screaming ): No! ( loud rumbling ) ( screaming ) Diane! Diane! Diane! Diane! Man: Don't panic. Proceed in an orderly fashion. Please, calm down, people. ( garbled radio transmission ) ( coughing ) I want everybody up for a head count, now. When can we go back in? Have to wait for engineering's okay. My daughter might be in there. It's not going to do anybody any good, sir, if we all get killed. Hold on. I need your gear. Take care of them. Sir... That's not a good idea, sir. What's your call, captain summerlin? The structure hasn't pancaked any more Since the main quake. But I've got to wait for engineering To sign off before I send anyone else in. I'm not asking anyone to go with me. Chief, you can't go in there alone. It's too dangerous. I'll take you in. Everyone else, hold on till engineering gets here. Man: Yes, sir. Come on. I never did introduce myself. I'm sam thorell. George. I want to thank you, george. You're doing a lot for a total stranger. A crisis like this makes people come together. Sort of too bad it takes that. But here we are. Man: ...Surrounding waters around the city Until further notice. I would like to pay you. Don't worry about it. Well, thanks again. ( coughing ) Oh god, please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up. Miss emily. All right. Yes. It is all right. Because it's my time. No, no. It's not your time. Noname, do you know what it is To go through life invisible? Nobody sees you. Nobody knows your name. Come... Come closer. I want to tell you something I've never shared with anyone before. Come. Come closer. My first child... A boy... Died three days after birth. Such a short time on this earth. And yet, I think about him Every day of my life. I wonder what he might have been Had he been able To hang on to the gift of life. I named him clayton. If... If you would carry his name It would give me... Peace. Clayton. God has a reason For everything he does, clayton. A damn miracle is what we need. We had to pick our way, inch by inch Shoring up as we go. The infrared and videocams Have helped. So have the dogs. We have a pretty good idea Of where the survivors are. ( beams creaking ) ( loud rumbling ) Okay, let's go. We got nearly 50 kids out of the gym And even more out of what was left of the cafeteria But these classrooms... A lot of kids didn't make it. We got most of this equipment Through a breakaway in the wall. Some in pieces and then reassembled. More down this way. We've got three kids in here. Two boys and a girl. They got spunk though. They're hanging in. Roger, james, chrissy! Chrissy? Where? They're right in here. Behind that rubble. Christine? Daddy? Yes. Christy, where are you? I'm here. Keep talking. Christy: I'm over here. Ahearn: We're here to help you. Please, daddy. Honey, we're coming, baby. We're here to help you. Honey, we're coming. We're coming. Just hang in there, we're coming. ( dogs barking ) Hey, lady, stop. Wait. Ma'am. Ma'am, you're in the wrong place. This is a hazmat zone. There's a cyanide spill. You're lucky you didn't get that far. There's a curfew. Let us escort you to a safe place... Ma'am, please, it's for your own safety! Ma'am! A few more of these air bags And we'll inflate 'em You should be able to shimmy through. You guys, you still with us? Christy: Yeah. Boy: We tried to leave But couldn't find the door. What's your name, son? Roger, sir. Roger parkinson. My leg sure hurts. We're working on getting you out of here. We'll get you out as fast as we can. Christine's never mentioned your name before. Roger: I'm a jock. She doesn't hang out with jocks, right? I always told her brains over brawn. Roger: Thanks a lot. You a football player? No, wrestling. Varsity. What kind of wrestler are you Getting pinned down in a place like this? Christy: Will you guys please shut up? Please? She's weak. Christine? Yeah? Roger? You keeping an eye on everything in there? Roger: James isn't moving. Speak up, son. James isn't moving, sir. Hey, take it easy there, son. Listen, we're going to get you out. We've just got to take it one step at a time. You understand? Roger, you all right? Are you all right, son? Yeah. But I don't think she's awake anymore. Christine? I don't think so. We've got to get in there now. ( hissing ) Ready? Yeah. Let's go. Okay. We're coming, baby. Go. This structure's lost even more integrity With the aftershock. To hell with it. All my people are accounted for. So I say we go in anyway. I wouldn't recommend it. Here's the deal. Engineering says this structure's Ready to fall anytime. So we go in on a volunteer basis, folks. With no questions asked either way. Okay. All right, here we go. Probe gun. Here's the probe. Okay. Okay. Daddy? We'll get you out of here real soon Any second now, okay? Yeah, I promise. We'll get you out of here any second now, honey. Just try and think about what it's going to be like When you get out there. You're going to be looking at the moon. Is it night? Yeah, baby. It's night out. How you doing? You got to get us out of here, daddy. Give me a three footer. Here we go. Here we go. Hey, we need to shore up the roof Right over there. Man: Hey, get that oxygen over here! Okay. ( groaning ) Chrissy, it's me. We're going to get you out, baby. Daddy... We're going to get you out. Man: Hey, buddy, give me your hand. Give me your hand. You're going to be okay. We got you. ( crying ) It's all right. ( moaning loudly ) You're there, you're there! Pull out! Pull him out! Go! Baby... Leg's crushed. He's in shock! Woman: No time for a splint. Get him out. One, two, three!

Let's go to the paddles. Clear! Still nothing. Raising to 300. Clear! ( long beep ) Sorry, folks. She's gone. I was... With her. She knew that. Chief, I'll make sure she doesn't get lost in all this. I'll take care of it. ( rumbling and creaking ) Wait. Wait a minute. I'm going to get you out of here, miss emily! I will. I promise. So what did he do? He was charged with murdering his wife. Disabled wife. Disabled? Confined to a wheelchair. Did he do it? He was acquitted. Oh, man. Two pills? Doctor said to double my dose. When? About three weeks ago. Three weeks ago? Bert... Had you known him for long? Not very long. But it was pretty special, you know? I got a daughter about your age. She just had her first kid. That's cool. How does it feel to be a grandpa? Okay, enough rest. Can we, uh, can we please go? Go where? We've been up and down so many tunnels We couldn't even find our way back. We could be out by now If you all would just get up off your butts. Hey, you don't have to be rude. There are places we'd rather be. Great. Let's go. ( shrieks ) Nora! She's hurt. Nora, you okay? Stay still. ( nora crying ) Why does this keep happening to me? Why does this keep happening to me, huh? All these little weak, weak, weak little people around me Trying to pull me down! Who do you think you are? The guy who'll get you out of here So you better do what I say. Hey! Joshua, back off! Oh, my god. Pretty bad, huh? Well, at least the sun came up.

What are we going to do? You're going to have to wait over there With the rest of the parents. That's my son up there. I'm not going anywhere Until you tell me what it is You are going to do. The whole building's like a shattered eggshell. The facade is actually holding it up. It's ready to come down And I don't want to be the one to help it. We can't get a ladder truck in So we tried the helicopter-- You saw what happened. The wash from the blades Nearly toppled the entire structure. We have to figure out a way To make a climb. A climb? The stairwells have all been destroyed So we need to go up the outside. There's an exposed beam right there. Throw a lead line over that And run a static line. I don't think that's safe. I'll do it. I don't think so. I-I can do it. I'm an expert rock climber. It's out of the question. I've climbed el capitan, half dome... Mount mckinley in January. I know what I'm doing And I'm half the weight of any of you. Ma'am, please! You go up, you'll bring the building down And kill my son, and I won't let that happen. I need to use your climbing equipment. I'll need some estriers Some ascenders and some bieners. Lady, I'm in charge here And I'm telling you I can't let you go. And I need a rope gun! Heads up! Here it comes! Attach a static line. Haul it in and tie it off. Make the daisy chain a little shorter. Okay. Thanks. And hand me the estrier. You sure you're up for this? Yeah, I'm sure. Mr. Devlin?

But we need the bed. The young man who came in with her He's in the hall. She was my mother. She was a tough lady. I didn't think she was gonna die. I want to, uh... I want to thank you For everything you tried to do. What did I try to do? I couldn't get out. I couldn't climb out a window. I couldn't get up the stairs. All I did was sit there and let her die. Um... I don't even know your name. My name is clayton. Clayton. It's nice to meet you, clayton. Where is she? Diane... It's from my mom-- "I'm okay, I've gone to amy's I'll wait for you and diane there." She's gone to my aunt amy's. She's okay. She's all right. This is good. Nicholai, thank you. Thank you.

He was no help anyway. Is that a reason for you to try to kill him? What?! Your wife... She was no help either, right? Wait a second. Just wait a second. You yourself said, counselor No one really knows what happened in that room. I was wrong. I know. I know exactly what happened in that room. Did choking her make you feel strong, joshua? Yes, it did. She was sucking the life out of me, evie. No matter what I did, she always wanted more. She was so weak. Exactly. So, really... It was her own fault. Her fault? I bet that was her last thought. Why are you so angry? You won the trial. And I'm going to have to live with that. Not necessarily, evie. Evie... Evie, wait! Evie! ( panting ) ( yelling and grunting ) Damn it! Stop!

How you doing, buddy? I was looking for you at the apartment. Thought I'd lost everything. Oh, god. Not everything. Not everything. Call me back. Can I, uh... Can I talk to you a minute?

You might be able to talk to him. I'll give it a try. This is jillian parnell Over the aircraft carrier, uss intrepid. Dignitaries and reporters have assembled here today At the intrepid To hear national, state and civic leaders Commemorate the first anniversary Of the tragic new york city earthquake. As devastating as this catastrophe has been A remarkable fact has emerged From the rubble of this disaster. New yorkers, so often characterized As cold and uncaring Have joined together in dramatic numbers To rebuild their city. Ahearn: A year ago today In the early hours after the earthquake I found myself working side by side with a man Who I'd already come to see as my political foe, my enemy. Then after the earthquake I watched him suffer his losses along with mine. I watched him persevere for this city Through his pain and anguish And I realized that he was no more or less than I-- Just a man like me-- Trying to save what was left of his home. That enemy became my friend And I am very proud to introduce to you my friend The mayor of the city of new york Bruce lincoln. ( applause ) I speak to all of you who have chosen to stay here And I must say that it is fitting That we are on our feet once again, standing together. We stand side by side, rebuilding brick by brick The greatest city in the world! Much will never be replaced. And there's an empty spot in everyone's heart for all those Who can never be seen, felt or held close ever again. But we must seize the opportunity To rebuild ourselves as well. For we can lay a new And unshakable foundation only in our hearts. We are poised now together Not unlike the immigrants of past and present Who sought refuge here Armed with little more Than the hope and the will to make a new life And make a new life we will. ( applause ) Your father would be so proud of you. Go back. They love you like I love you. Nobody loves me like you love me, nicholai!
