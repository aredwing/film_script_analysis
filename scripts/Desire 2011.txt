Can you imagine? With a nurse. They did it at our place. Jerome wouldn't do that. Actually, he hasn't done anything for months. l want a tattoo. Doesn't it hurt? Sometimes l like that when we fuck. What do you mean? You've never been spanked? On the ass? That's where it's usually done. Are you crazy? My guy'd never do that. He respects me. He must not be very good. l'm so lucky. My new one fucks me like a rabbit. l'm all irritated. lt's almost too much. Do you really want to get a tattoo? What kind of a tattoo? Below my belly button. The word ''paradise'' or something. - The usual. - She's nuts. How about ''You're Welcome''? l want to drive them crazy. To Cyril Collard, and to all those who still believe that love means something. Where do you want to go? Stop here. This is fine. - Here? - Yes, please. - ls this OK? - Yeah, wherever. l don't care. What were you looking for back at the bar? A Tupperware container or something. What for? For my father's ashes. You went to a bar to get a container for his ashes? l had them in a plastic bag but it had a hole in it. My father kept leaving. Half of him blew away. Are you allowed to carry someone's ashes around like that? l don't want to leave him in a ditch. So you stole the... You can't do that. He worked his whole life to provide for me. lt's the least l can do. He was a painter but he refused to sell his work. He was a bodywork repairman. lronically, the paint got to his lungs. We found out he was sick when he went to the hospital. He never came out again. That's too bad. l don't know what to say. You're really gullible, aren't you? l can't believe you. The guy spent his life slaving away and his retirement in a cemetery. - Why are you like that? - Come on, let's go. - Don't you want to kiss me? - Don't you have a boyfriend? He's a nice guy. He won't beat you up. Your friend said he'd pay us every week. Yes, but you know Maurice. He said we took our time. We were only going to redo one room, not everything. Yeah, that's true. So he's two weeks late in paying us. Chance, wait. What? He wasn't very nice but he'll think about it. Cool. No, not cool. What about you? Are you seeing anyone? l met a girl, kind of by chance. Are you blind? Didn't you see me coming? You want me to calm down? Look at my car! You stink of beer! ls that your dad? The louder one is. lt must not always be easy. Are you a mechanic? l repair cars. lt's not always easy. We've been together ever since. lt's complicated. Her dad... l have to pee. Are you staying here? Are you looking for me? What are you playing at? Don't you like games? What do you think of my ass? What are you doing? - Do you like my ass? - What do you think? How about my breasts? Of course l like your breasts. And my nipples? Do you feel how hard they are? Stop it. Touch me. Touch me. And my pussy? Can you feel how wet it is? l'm gonna fuck you. lf you fuck me, l'll yell. Touch me... lf you yell, no one will hear you. Don't you like yelling? Only when l make girls come. l don't mind if you touch me. You can do whatever you want. But you can't fuck me. - What if l fuck you anyway? - You don't get it. l must be too dumb. You're too impatient. Which one do you like better? My pussy or my ass? l'm gonna give it to you. You're not listening. Am l torturing you? You poor bitch. But a bitch you'd like to fuck. What do you want? You can't fuck me and think of someone else. Will you drive me back? - What are you doing here? - You're out of breath. Yeah, Alex and l had a problem. Maurice chased us. - Can we get out of here? - No, we can't. - What good is your car? - Not much right now. Did it break down? l promised Sonia l would take her to the Caen funfair. But my car... Other than pushing it or blowing it up, l don't see how l can make it move. For an electronics nerd who can start any kind of car, you disappoint me. ln case you didn't notice, my car is a '96 Fiat. Back then you almost had to pedal for a PC to work. Don't you have a date with Cecile? Oh, shit! - Well, see you soon. - Yeah, whatever. Come on, don't sulk. You never know, maybe we'll fuck someday. You're such a ladies' man. You never fucking stop. Do you always act like a slut? You're cute. Don't give up so easily. - How are you doing? - lt's pretty simple. Red cards for the sale prices, blue cards for regular prices. What do you study? Political science. l'm not too good at maths. Will you manage? Don't worry, Mr Daniel. l want to spend more time with you, all the time. But just telling you that scares me. l'm afraid l'll scare you away. When you leave, l'm afraid l'll never see you again. lt's horrible to feel how much you could make me suffer if you were to disappear. l love you. Will you come to my place? Stop asking me that. Don't you want to? You've never come over. Yeah, l want to, but... ..you don't understand what l want. l'd like to live in a house with a big garden, with flowers everywhere and horses and lots of children. - You don't like horses? - l do. What do you mean, she left with a guy? We had a date. She wanted to see the sea. Matt, Big Bernard's son, offered to take her. Shit, there's water everywhere here. She left this. What is that? The remnants of her ashtray? Who knows. - Wait, don't open it. - What is it? lt's Cecile's... l mean the... forget it. Tell her l took her dad home. Do you mind if l put this in the trunk? Just don't leave your shit in there. lt's not mine. Don't joke about it. Aren't we touchy? Give me a wrench. Does this thing work? Yeah, it works. But when you find money, the land owner gets half of the cash. Half of the cash is still cash. Yeah, but it takes ages, and the equipment is expensive. What does Sonia think? l've stopped thinking of her. That's not what you said three months ago. We shouldn't have moved in together. Here's your thing back. l'm staying out of trouble for now. - Did you try it? - No, l didn't have time. ls that your tool for stealing cars? Can l try it? lf you can get out of here with it, go for it. Where will he go? l don't know. Straight up there. You're not easy to find. Will you come over? lf you want me to. You can't sleep? Do you want some water? l'm exhausted. Your mother called me. She left several messages. You won't answer her calls. Stop it. Why? l'm not in the mood. Don't l turn you on any more? l'd have to be dead. Don't say that. You turn me on. Cecile, please... Stop. See how l still turn you on? Do you want to kill me? You're mine. - l'm talking about desire. - Pleasure? lt's complicated. There's a difference between desire and love. Men are all the same. Mine doesn't know that l can come. l slept with a guy who didn't know what a clit was. He thought l had a button between my legs. Going down on me disgusted him. When we're single, we bitch about it. When we're not, we bitch at the guy. There's something wrong with that. Where are we going? To see a guy l know well. Don't worry. What are you doing? l don't have the keys. - Shit! - Do you need help, fatso? - Come over for dinner. - l'm seeing Cecile. Do you like it? l don't know. You said there was no one here. There's no one in the offices. Then why are you whispering? l'm not whispering. Go ahead, draw me something. Yesterday, Alizee was crazy. She was dressed all sexy and glamorous, you know? l started touching her and she was into it. Suddenly, she pushed me away. Don't try to understand. Wait, there's more. l was tired so l went to sleep. l dreamt that someone was holding my cock. l woke up and saw her jerking me off like crazy. She just took my cock and stuck it in her pussy. lt was crazy. Go on, concentrate. You fuckers! PAY UP, MAURlCE! - What are you doing? - l wanted to see you. You can't just show up like this. You can't stay here. Did you miss me? - Yes, but you don't understand... - l do. l understand that l need you. Not here. Alice? Yes? Your father wants you to clean the trash cans. He asked me to put them in the shed. He's been a pain lately. Don't hold it against him. He's tired. They're making him work twice as hard since they laid off half of his co-workers. That's awful. lt's not easy for him after 30 years on the job. That's for sure. What are you doing? Are you making fun of me? What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Didn't you like it? That's not the point. l like you. You don't know how much. l can't live without you. - What did you say earlier? - Never mind. Do you think l shouldn't have fucked her? - What are you doing with that? - l need a lamp for my house. Chance, do you think l shouldn't have fucked her? Come on. Tell me. - Forget it. - Tell me, l'm your buddy. You don't want to tell me? What's wrong? l'm wondering what you really want. You, for starters. Do you want to do me? Do you want a blow job? lf you want to. Are you happy? Does it relax you? What? After you come, l can bring you a beer. OK, stop. What's your problem? What's wrong? lt's you. What did l do? All those women you slept with... l have nightmares about it. Don't think about it. lt was a long time ago. What can l do about it? lt hurts me so much that l can barely sleep. l'm crazy about you. There is only you, you know. Just you. We're like a big family here. You're my daughter's age. l like working with people who are on the same wavelength. Call me Maurice. lt'll be simpler. OK? Come on, l'll show you the workshop. You'll like it. See? We careen boats. We remove the paint and we repair them like new. l told you to get out of here. Come on. l like you, you know? l like you very much. You're not shy, you know what you want. - Do you feel your daughter up? - l'm sorry? Aren't l the same age as your daughter? - So what? - You're touching me... l thought you were smart. l don't find my future ex-boss too brilliant. - l don't like your tone. - l'll explain. l don't use my body as an elevator, get it? Let me make it clear. lf you want the job, lie down. You piece of shit. Who do you think you are, asshole? You better see a doctor. Nothing to do with your balls. You need to get all that shit out of your head! She was out of control. l didn't know if l should fuck her. - Losing her dad turned her on. - Yeah. lf it has that effect, she should lose him more often. - Don't say that, please. - You guys are weird. - l've known her since we were seven. - So have l, but we don't fuck. How old were you the first time, 1 5? And two years later, there was Leonore who made you all crazy. l don't want to get attached. Neither does she. l could attach her to the bed... That sounds like love. Love is two weeks of happiness, two months of arguing and two years of recovering. We hang out when we feel like it. l don't want to miss out on all the other chicks. No jealousy. Shit, it's perfect. - Shit. - That's what l just said. Shit, Manu! Run! Fucker! You son of a bitch! You little bitch! Manu, is there any vodka left? How should l know? l'm sick of him beating on that thing. ls something wrong, Manu? He got beat up by Chance's friends. Cecile, your boyfriend's always in trouble. That's none of my business. Yesterday he was telling me about the strike and l was listening, when suddenly he lifted up my skirt and tried to do me. Can you believe it? Manu would never dare to do that. He'd be scared that l'd rip his balls off. Go on, show off for them. l'll take you while you do the dishes, honey. l never do the dishes. You need to clean up soon. My landlord is after me. l owe him three months' rent. He's getting pissed. Next, your boss will fire you. What's wrong with you? l got fired three months ago. l'm glad l have friends. - l'm sorry. - lt's OK, you're drunk. She's not drunk. l'm waiting for my corkscrew. How was the funeral? lt's over. Shouldn't we do something to get ourselves out of this shit? How do we find jobs when there are none? We could start a solidarity fund. That's a good idea but how do we get money in there? We have some cards up our sleeves. - What cards? - l don't know. Do you think we're gonna sleep around for money? Whatever. Who's coming climbing this weekend? Climbing onto whom? Climbing up a cliff. With ropes. You'd like that, wouldn't you, Cecile? l know someone who'd love to tie you up. l think she'd like that. l never get attached, sweetie. Never. l doubt it. Are you sure? l'm sure. What if l did it? - You won't get anywhere with me. - Shall we try? Do you like it? Stop, l feel ashamed. lt's like l'm doing something wrong. But don't stop, just don't stop. ls there any beer left? lt sounds scary. Do you really think it sounds scary? ls that all you have? l'll see what l can do. Come by tomorrow. Thanks. Matt? Have a look at the boy's Fiat. lt's easy. - Let me just finish this. - Here. That's all he has. You can't help people out for nothing. How will you get ahead like that? lt's no big deal. l'm expecting clients soon. Otherwise l'm in big trouble. Don't worry. lt'll be OK. Shit, he almost got me last time. Some poor guy will be stuck repainting it. Move over. You and your fucking stories. l didn't think he'd get you. You're careless. Of course you get people into shit. You're in a bad mood. When will you realise you have to get wet to swim? l didn't think you'd get caught. - Are you OK? - Yeah. Are you sure? l'm fine. lt's the booze. Sonia's not there? - Do you see her? - Do you know about tomorrow? She asked me to help Serge to take stuff out of his bar. l don't know where she is. l don't give a shit. l got rid of that slut. She was crying. lt was pathetic. What's up with you? Girls don't deserve us. l'll stick a bag over their heads, that'll teach them. They'll learn to think twice. - Keep them at home. - No, in the cellar. That way no one will hear them yell. We'll pull off their nipples and burn their pussies if they fuck the neighbour. Why are you saying that? Forget it. With the pound losing its value... We forgot your dad. - We didn't buy anything for him. - l'll go back another day. l'm going to meet the big boss. l'll bring him brandy next time. They're paying me 7,500. Then they'll transfer me. lt doesn't seem right. Times are tough. - They could have outsourced. - Of course. But your job is hard. You should be paid well. l clean up. That's the deal. They pay me according to the results. l have to give them the results they need. l don't know how you can trust them. l don't get it. Even if... even if they shut down the factory,... they've guaranteed... ..that l'll get a hefty sum. - Are you sure? - Yes. Does that reassure you? - You know what? - What? What do you say we go somewhere... more private? You don't like it here? Have you ever had sex on a boat? l like getting fucked on the open sea. How about the bathroom? lsn't that kind of shady? l'm so horny. Aren't you? No, not this time. l'll be home late today, l have class after work. Don't worry, and tell mom not to wait up. l understand. Do you want a little present? A very personal present. You're soaked. Excuse me. How are you, Alex? Yeah, l found it. lt's great, huh? l have to go, we're about to dock. See you soon. lf you want to call me someday... l found a great gift. - What is it? - A Stooges record, a first pressing. He'll love it. l found a place for the party. - Holy shit. - l'm sorry. l can't believe she just left. Yeah, but... she's not bad. She looks like Matt's girlfriend. Help me instead of checking out her ass. No need to check mine out. Sorry. Yeah, enjoy. Will you walk me to work? Can l see you tonight? You never give up. l want to make love to you for hours. l want you to scream with pleasure. Let me go. You couldn't care less. l'm touched. lt's just that you think about it all the time. What are you doing here? Mum? We were just going for a walk. - Good morning. - l thought you were at work. - l was on my way there. - Sure. - They have to change the pool water. - What are you wearing? Stop, Mum. - Let's go home. - We didn't do anything. Did you hear me? lf your father knew... l don't care. l'm tired of... You're coming with me! Don't argue with me. You hit me. l saw her in the street with a guy. You can't imagine! l saw his eyes, the way he looked at her. Alice? Can't you clean up? l did... You never listen. That's why your mum's mad. l didn't do anything. Do you remember what l said? The young men here waited for the Krauts... - The Germans. - They massacred them. Your grandfather stood at the window. The only thing that idiot managed to do was to be seen. The Krauts, the Germans, found him and they took revenge. They killed him in front of his pregnant wife. He was young, not even 25 years old. But he was an honest man. He married your grandmother when she got pregnant. Dad... Not all men are like your grandfather. l know. How about we find you an apartment? But promise me something. - Promise you'll call us. - But what will mom say? You heard her. She's scared for you. She forgot how she and l used to meet secretly. Her parents could never have stopped us. - Don't worry. - l do worry. You know, sweetie,... ..we don't know what will happen. What are you doing in the rain? Nothing. We were about to leave. l feel like fucking. Right now? No, with a guy l met on the boat from England. Can l have the joint, Alex? l'm going to sell the copper. Touch me. That's enough. You and Alex could fuck me. Don't go too far, OK? l like it when you're like this. l'm sorry. Just take it easy. What do you expect? - Of whom? - Of me. Nothing. - Do l surprise you sometimes? - Never. You deserve a spanking. That's exactly what turns me on. Spank me. Let's sell the copper. - Let's go. - Come on. That girl on the boat was cute. What girl on the boat? You know who l mean. She was really pretty. l didn't notice. She was sitting next to us. When we left the port, she dropped her bag. Oh, that one. She was cute. - Are you going to bed? - l want to watch a movie. l didn't say ''to sleep''. - You know l can't. - lt's all in your head. l'm sorry. Not yet. l'm not ready yet. Are you sure? What if... ..l'd fucked her in the bathroom? You're such a pervert. - Did she turn you on? - Yes. Do you want to do her? Yes. ln front of you. ln front of me? You'd have to watch her giving me a blow job. She'd go down on you. She'd make you come. And l'd watch you do her... ..like a bitch, on all fours. l'd take her in the ass, hard. l'd see your cock disappear into her ass. The more she'd scream,... ..the harder l'd do her. Until... until you came. Until l covered her in cum. l'm fine. Let me be. Please. lt's really nice of you. lt was Cecile's idea to call everyone. - Of course. - You won't forget your 26th. Don't be a bore. We're really near the water. Why do you wanna go there? What are you doing? - We were waiting for you. - Very funny. lt's a friend's birthday. Will you stay with us? lf you stay with me. Don't take advantage of me. l'm drunk. And your girlfriend? What girlfriend? Alice? She runs off when l touch her. You're still thinking about her. l don't know. l'm lost. The thing is that you make me hard. l can't stop thinking of you. Of my little ass? - Do you wanna swim? - No, it's too cold. How about a swim? - There we go. What was l saying? - Yeah, let's go. l want you. - Now? - Yes. - Right now. - You never stop. You drive me crazy. l don't understand. l can't take it any more. We're going to swim! Wait for me. l'll be back. Come here. Harder. Hurt me. Fuck me hard. Fuck me! l'll tear you apart. Hit me. Again. Come on. Again! Harder. Again. l don't feel anything. Helo'i'se almost said yes to the pictures. l really want to see Sonia. Who cares? l'm sure she already regrets it. l want to know where she is. We do some strange stuff. This guy called once. He'd dialled the wrong number. That always happens to me. He turned me on because he had a very sexy voice. - He got you all wet. - Don't be so vulgar. Leave us alone. Go on. The first time, we talked for a while and just before hanging up, he asked if he could call me back. You didn't! l can't believe you. What about your boyfriend? He never found out. He kept calling me then l started missing him when he didn't call. - But l didn't want to call him. - Why? l'd rather he called me. That's what turned me on. We talked about lots of things, especially about sex. You were scammed. Let her talk. Tell us what happened. We planned to meet at that hotel in front of the station. The Select Hotel? l thought it was for whores. No, it's a decent hotel. He gave me very precise instructions. l had to wait for him in bed, naked and on my stomach. Did he come? He was very delicate. - You didn't... - Did you do it? He took his time, he was so gentle. He was very good. lt was incredible. l felt like my body had been needing that for a long time. And the fact that l couldn't see him turned me on even more. ln the end, he took me in the ass. - Didn't it hurt? - That's disgusting. lf the guy wants to, l let him. They're all secretly gay. But l liked it. lt was different. The pleasure was more violent than making love. Stop, you're turning me on. So what happened to him? He never called again. l'm really confused, Sonia. We can't go on like this. We have to talk. Don't you think so? Hello? Fucking voicemail! l was in class. Can you wait for me? Yeah, l know where it is. l'll fire them and send them a cheque. Do you think it'll calm them down? No, not really. l'm sitting outside, at a cafe, like we planned. Can you hear me? l said l'm... l did what you asked me to do. l'm not wearing panties. l can't believe l did that. Yes, l'm outside. Come over. You wanted a bottle, right? l brought some makeup too. No, not for my pussy. Don't be silly. OK. l've left you 25 messages. l just want to talk to you. You can't just leave like that and not talk to me any more. lt's awful. We're better than that, Sonia. You know it. l'm begging you, call me back. lt's getting worse and worse. Do you have time to meet up? No, but they're exhausted. You can't come? l'm in front of the cafe. Where are you? You can't keep calling me. l have to talk to you. l have to... All right, but later. l have customers. l can't talk. You're busy? l'd like to see you. l have to work. l can't talk right now. l have to go, OK? Bye. Could you take out the Peugeot later? No problem. No need to come in tomorrow, there's nothing to do. l know but l'll come anyway. lf you want to. - Who is it? - Guess. - l don't like riddles. - Too bad. l waited all night long. Yeah, l know. l'm sorry but l couldn't make it. Why not? What's going on? - Turn around. - Here? l don't care. Turn around. - You're not doing well. - Shut up. Wait. l'll help you. Can't you see it's not working? Stop, it hurts. - l don't understand you. - Can l have your keys? - What for? - Don't you want to fuck? - Not at my place. - You're complicated. What about you? You show up and you disappear. l was with someone better before you. l don't understand you. You don't know how to love. You've become boring. l liked you better impotent. - Leave me alone. - What's wrong with you? l got it. Your stairs are such a pain. l'm sorry but l didn't make them. Shit. Everyone's nuts, especially the guys. Did you notice? lt's fear of unemployment. You know what? l caught mine jerking off in his car. Mine's become obsessed with sex. He wanted to do it in the hallway of my building. - That's nice. - He just had to fuck. At least he's original. Now you show up? Where were you? - Sorry, l had job interviews. - There you are. Let's hurry, they're watching. We're not taking the heavy stuff. Leave it up there. l won't leave my landlord anything. My guy said this stuff while we fucked. - lt turned me on. - What did he say? He pretended l was getting paid to fuck. lt wasn't original but it did the trick. lt's original for some people. No, my ex gave that to me. - Thanks. - Which one? l hate it. Now l can finally get rid of it. lt's the super. Quiet. Alizee, would you get fucked in front of your boyfriend? Oh, no. l couldn't. But l wouldn't mind doing it for money. Guys think up weird stuff. Getting paid to fuck is kind of a boring fantasy. Given the situation, l'm starting to think about it. Why not get paid to fuck? lt's like that unemployed guy in the movie who becomes a Chippendale. Just for one night. - Does it work in the movie? - Totally. Even if they pay me, l'm sorry, but l get to choose who l fuck. And we don't bring the guys. - ls the super still there? - l'll go and see. - He won't budge. - Can we get out of the window? - l don't think so. - That's not good news. Anyway, all guys are pigs. - You're kind of butch, aren't you? - So what? Guys are very interesting between ten and midnight. They should be gentler. l like getting tied down. Tied down with a rope? lsn't it humiliating? Please! Try it out, you'll see. - At least we can't fake it. - True. - You fake it? - Sometimes you have to. Once, l was so tired l had to fake it so he'd let me sleep. They forget we're not sex machines. lf l don't feel like it, l kick him out of bed. Now with the strike, they'll have more time for sex. Dream on. All they care about is the size of their dicks! lt's just a phone but it's also a camera, a laptop, the internet, everything. lt's an absolute must-have. Are you travelling for pleasure or for business? - Do you have a cigarette? - Do you want to come on deck with me? Why can't we stay here? You can't smoke on boats any more. You can't smoke anywhere any more. OK, wrong answer. Excuse me? Do you have a cigarette? l even have a lighter. And here's my card. You can't smoke here. lf l only did what's allowed, life would be sad, wouldn't it? - Don't you think so? - l agree. How would you like to... light... my cigarette in the bathroom? OK. You go first. l'll join you in five. There are two possibilities. He might realise what we did and we'll have five minutes to run. lf he's madly in love, he'll wait until we get to the port. l have nothing to do with this. ls that so? Come in here. lt's not very cosy but we'll be left alone. Do you smoke? Do you often go to England? l buy clothes there. How's that for an answer? Come on, chill out. l hadn't planned on travelling in the bathroom either. Even in very good company. What's your deal? You like to scam people? Or do you just like robbing them? You're pretty. Don't change the subject. You just need to get these ridiculous things off. l can't see. Leave me alone. You've got two choices. Do you ever stop? Do you like turning men on? Why men? They're so predictable. Haven't you ever wanted to fuck just like that, for fun? No, l never talk about that. l don't want to talk about that. Not like this. Don't you ever think of... very nasty things, dirty things? Things that turn you on? Tell me what you think about. We might never see each other again. Guys... They know exactly how to explain that... ..pleasure has nothing to do with love. - What do you want? - What about you? Stop. l'm sure you're all wet between your legs. Come on, don't worry. l'm just gonna touch you. What are you doing? How long have you gone without fucking? Did you caress yourself? No. Yes. l... l touched myself. What did you think of? l don't know. A cock. Matt... ..making love to me. Open your legs. No. l can't. What's stopping you? l'm not like that. Look. You're beautiful. Look. Tell me you like it. My cellphone! You stole my phone. You hit on me as soon as l sat down! Have a look, sir. - She has an accomplice. - Sure she does... l'm sorry, miss. Let's go to the station. - But she... - We'll go and explain. But she stole my phone. We'll see about that. Come with me. Cecile? l don't know if you recognise me. No. Oh, yes. l'm sorry to bother you but my husband said you'd be here today. What exactly do you want? Yves talks a lot about you and l wanted to see you. So? l know it's stupid. - l'm sorry, never mind. - No, wait. Come back. lt's silly. l haven't seen anyone in six months. l'm glad you came. He talks about you to me too and he's right. You're beautiful. So are you. l'm happy to see you. l love him, you know. Mr Daniel! What happened? l'm OK. l just need to sit down. Are you sure? What can l do? Please don't mention it. You should really see a doctor. l'm a toilet cleaner to you, but l had another life. l don't see you like that. l had great love stories with women... With wonderful women. And then, l got married... with a woman who was so... She was... And then when she... When she left,... ..l knew it was over. l haven't touched a woman in... ..in 25 years. PERMANENTLY CLOSED So, what's the deal? What are you gonna do exactly? l thought we were here to talk about us. - So it's none of my business? - That depends. You girls are weird, aren't you? So l'm not allowed to join in? lf you want to pay, why not? Let me see if l understand. lf l want to screw you, l have to pay? Dream on. l didn't say l wanted to fuck you. Sonia, l know l messed up. Now you realise it? l should've taken better care of you. l didn't pay enough attention. Stop it. - How are you? - Fine. l'm surprised you called. And l'm surprised you kept that jerk's cellphone. - l have a favour to ask you. - What kind of favour? lt's kind of strange. - Not another fantasy... - l didn't make you come. - OK, stop. - lf you want me to. l don't think we should have met up again. Do you want to get out? OK, let's go. - l miss you, it's too hard. - Stop. Honestly, l think about you all the time. l can't live without you. Now you tell me? Now you tell me? l can't be away from you. Please stop, Sonia. l'll prove my love to you every day. What made you realise that? The fact that l left you? - Hi, l'm looking for Alice. - She's not here. - How long ago did she leave? - l don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? lf you hurt her, l'll kill you. - l killed a guy. - You don't know that. He wasn't moving. He was lying there like a dog. What have l done? Shit! You have to call the hospital. l keep screwing up since Sonia left me. All l do is mess up. l stole a car and l hit a guy. Can you imagine? Did you use your tool? l stole an amazing car. That's all. Go back to where it happened. Are you crazy? l can't. Go home and calm down, OK? l'll take care of it, OK? Calm down, OK? Did you just get hit by a car? Are you OK? Yeah. Leave me alone. - Let's go to hospital. - l'm fine. l said l'm fine. Weren't you at my birthday party? You're Cecile's pseudo boyfriend. What are you talking about? How about you shut up? You're getting on my nerves. Right, so your chick doesn't have a boyfriend either. Jerk. You've just been crashed into by a car. That's the only reason l won't beat you up. lf that's what it's like to love someone,... ..you deserve each other. You're both jerks. l'm taking you to a wonderful place. lt's a house that was lent to me. You'll go in alone. I won't go with you. You'll take the scarf and the hood that are on a table in the entrance. Someone will come. You will let her in. ls it here? You have to wait over there. l have to blindfold you. Oh, right; the blindfold. - l have to open the door. - Yes, of course. lt's my first time, you know? He won't hurt me, will he? Could you ask him not to be violent? lt's the first time l've done anything like this. You will let in the second person and put the hood on him. - Hello. - Hello. They can't talk to each other. Can l come in? Yes, but l have to put this on you. You'll uncover the woman's breasts. Then you'll push the man towards the woman. - You'll help them to make love. - I can't do that. You can't or you won't? - l couldn't. - l'm not asking you to fuck. - But l can't... - Yes, you are. lt's like on the boat when you saw me stealing. - You like taking risks. - No, l don't. Didn't you like it when they stopped you and you managed to trick them? Why me? Because l'm sure you can do it. l'd bet my tongue on it! Trust me. You're awful. Why? l just did them a favour. She was pushing herself. Why are you so aggressive with me? l'm sorry. You're forgiven. What about her husband? - Don't you get it? - What? The blindfold so they couldn't see each other... lt was her husband who just had sex with her. Did he know? Of course not. l don't get it. The young woman, Virginie, had a bad experience a few months ago and she needed to feel pleasure again, without feeling guilty. l'm sorry. Not this time. From now on, when you behave badly, l'll give you a dare. Do you agree? OK? Yes. Alright. You'll go to this address. Now. You'll undress and you'll sit on the bed. A man will come and you'll welcome him. Yes, I want you to wait for him, naked on the bed. I don't know if I can. Yes, you can. - Hi, Cecile. - l have to go. So what's this crazy idea? But still, to make them pay... They fuck us as if we belonged to them. They pay and we get to choose. lt's heaven, isn't it? And with this money, we can even help the strikers. Yeah, we'll see. So, shall we? Cecile, you're crazy. And so are we, for following you. Are you ready? They're here. They're waiting. They've paid. Now we have to choose. Alice? Will you give me a special price? No. For you, it's free. - Are you crazy? - Don't talk to me like that. Come on. Can l put on my jacket? Come on. l have something to show you. You're hurting me. You're hurting yourself. He's not coming back, Cecile. Go away! - What about him? - Drop that. - Why? You don't care. - Shut up. Drop it! You can't... But... Who do you think you are? You can't do that! But you can? You can take care of others, but not of yourself. Go away. Go away! Don't you think it's time you buried your father for good? Let's go. Come on. We're not coming back. l love you. l love you. Even if it won't always be easy.
