STUNNER: The reason I wanted to join the SEALs was for missions like this. The dream of getting this call. VIVIAN: As it happened that night, the President was due to give a speech. White House Correspondents' Dinner. A room full of journalists. The fact is, only a handful of his aides knew that just before the event... the President had authorized the raid. PRESIDENT OBAMA: All right, everybody, please have a seat. [applause] My fellow Americans... [cheering] it is wonderful to be here... at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. What a week. STUNNER: We done hundreds of missions like this. Dead-of-the-night type raids. What was different was the target. SETH MEYERS: It's such an honor performing for those of you here tonight, as well as the handful of people watching at home on C-SPAN. People think Bin Laden is hiding in the Hindu Kush, but did you know that every day from four to five, he hosts a show on C-SPAN? [laughter and applause] CHERRY: In this world, you don't get to live free without working for it. You got to earn it every day. And...that day we did. MAN: It's good to see you. "Talk" may be the wrong word. Can you imagine being tied down and your skin peeled off? Did you know you have three layers of skin? So it can take a while. It will make your time here seem like heaven. I expect you will end up dying. Their torture chambers are state-of-the-art. And your wife and children. They will go, too. MAN: What can I do? MAN: Give me something to chew on. I need to show the guys with the keys that you are worth keeping around. And there are 25 million green reasons for you to help us find the man we want. MAN: I have nothing. [sighs] MAN: I know. That's why I'm letting the Saudis borrow you. [sniffs] I wish it could end up better for you. But at least now you can take comfort in the fact that this is definitely going to end. You're on your own. MAN: What have you got? MAN: Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti MAN: The courier? MAN: Let's find him. MAN: Understood. MAN: Now. PRESIDENT OBAMA: If we have actual intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf will not act, we will. SENATOR McCAIN: Teddy Roosevelt used to say, "Talk softly, but carry a big stick." Senator Obama likes to talk loudly. PRESIDENT OBAMA: We will kill Bin Laden, we will crush Al-Qaeda. That has to be our biggest national security priority. [horns honking] VIVIAN: The phone call that we traced tied the courier back in with Al-Qaeda. We immediately put two assets on the ground in Peshawar. ANALYST: Pan to the left. Your other left. Got it. And watch the profanity. I understand Pashto. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] ANALYST: On your left, talking right now. That's our man. WASEEM: It's okay. There he is. He's coming out. Let's go! MALIK: Hold this. ANALYST: We've got a good signal. Don't blow your cover. WASEEM: Keep the distance. You have caught him. MAN: Target is heading due east. WASEEM: Give him some space. [horns honking] WASEEM: Get up here. Take this way. ANALYST: There he is. You're coming up behind him. MAN: Stay on course. ANALYST: I'm getting some interference. Keep your eyes on him. WASEEM: We have got him. We have got a visual. MAN: Target is approaching Karakoram Highway. Target is leaving Peshawar. ANALYST: Do you still have him? We're trying to get eyes on you. WASEEM: Yeah. We have still got him. The boy is headed to Abbottabad. MALIK: Are you sure? WASEEM: Yes. WASEEM: He's going off the road. [horn honking] ANALYST: We've got eyes back on him. WASEEM: So do we. ANALYST: Good work, gentlemen. We'll take it from here. MAN: Mr. President, this is the first time we've had eyes on the courier. We know he used to be a courier for Al-Qaeda. We have no confirmation they are still in contact, but we know the place is built like a fortress. REPORTER: The pace of American operations keeps going up from week to week. Night raids up six-fold, air strikes nearly doubled. The American troop surge in Afghanistan is part of what an aide to Petraeus calls "squeezing down on the Taliban like a giant anaconda." SOLDIER: Come on, let's move, Cherry. This gear ain't gettin' any lighter. MAN: SEAL Team Six, this mission should be simple. Transporting two Taliban operatives back to Khandahar Base. Pick-up within 10 mikes. Get in and get out. SOLDIER: Let's go, Mule. Keep that pace up. CHERRY: Growing up... it's pretty much just me and my mom. Eh... As a kid in junior high, I got stuffed in trash cans all the time. And then there was this one year I decided that wasn't gonna happen anymore. I started doing the beatin'. So now, here I am. I'm fightin' at the highest level of the United States of America. It was like... the SEALs were waiting for me, and I'd been waitin' for them. STUNNER: Exile 2 1, Exile 2 1, this is Wild Eagle Niner. Can I get a sit rep on that bird? Over. STUNNER: I joined because I felt I had a duty to my country, a country that I love. And there was really no other choice for me. TECH: Wild Eagle Niner Reaper 6 says Reaper 12 is inbound, TOT 50. Keep your ears open as they should be pushing Budweiser in 4 or 5 mikes. How copy? STUNNER: Hard copy, Exile 2 1. Out. CHERRY: What's up? STUNNER: Just keep movin'. Move up. TECH: Pick-up should be right over the next ridge, boys. TECH: Wild Eagle Niner, be advised you have four persons approaching you. Looks like LNs. No weapons observed. Over. STUNNER: See, I copy four likely LNs. No weapons observed. STUNNER: D-Punch? I want you to take Trench and check it out. D-PUNCH: Yeah, I got it. I got it. D-PUNCH: Hands up! Hands up! Hold up here. Take it easy, buddy. D-PUNCH: Sit down! Down! Sit down! MAN: Easy, easy. STUNNER: What's going on up there? D-PUNCH: They're wanting to have a female come up and do the pat-down. D-PUNCH: Maybe you can go ahead and send Cherry on up. CHERRY: Screw you, D-Bag. STUNNER: Let's go! We've got to move! TRENCH: Where's the fire? STUNNER: Get down! TECH: Captain Marshall, situation. STUNNER: We got a man hit! STUNNER: On the top ridge on the left! CHERRY: Stunner, are you hit? STUNNER: No, I'm good! STUNNER: Exile 2 1. Wild Eagle Niner. We've taken fire. At least one shooter. Can you give us info on his position? TECH: Exile 2 1, that's negative. I'm not seeing anything. Aaaah! STUNNER: Cherry, flank left! Move! Move! [yelling] STUNNER: You all right? MULE: No, man! I'm shot! STUNNER: One down. SOLDIER: Aaah! CHERRY: Surprise! All clears up here. STUNNER: Copy that. TRENCH: All clear. STUNNER: Exile 2 1, any more hostiles? TECH: Negative, Wild Eagle. No hostiles in view. STUNNER: We're all clear. Let's push the LNs through and get the hell out of here, all right? [D-Punch speaking foreign language] Let's go, guys. Come on. Move it out. Hold up! I need to finish searching. STUNNER: D, forget about it. Let's go! We got to move. STUNNER: Oh, D! D? D? STUNNER: You know, we're trained to live by the rules of engagement. Don't cause reckless harm. Don't use women, children, or old people for cover. And don't strap 50 pounds of explosives to your chest. But as team leader, I know if we give up on the moral code that our country believes in, then we're no better than them. CHERRY: My problem is very simple. It's with the rules. We got rules, the other side don't. MAN: Oh. VIVIAN: Okay, let's see. Good. Good, good, good. [speaking foreign language] WOMAN: Um, you're Malik? WASEEM: He is. I'm Waseem. WOMAN: Hi. Come, I'll take you inside. My family has owned the building for five years. And we take very good care of it. No pets allowed. And most of the residents are families. So, please, keep your parties quiet. WASEEM: No parties for us. WOMAN: Please come. This comes semi-furnished. We have television. There's no AC, but we can provide you with a cooler. There's 24 hours running water, most of the time. It's one bedroom. So you men will be sharing the bedroom? WASEEM: Hmm. Do you have any two-bedrooms? WOMAN: I'm afraid not. [sighs] This is a very peaceful neighborhood. Very quiet. Safe and very quiet. WASEEM: Quiet is good. VIVIAN: Come on, let me see the view. MALIK: That place looks like it's got some serious security. WOMAN: That house was built a few years ago by a wealthy Pashtun businessman. Strict Purdah family. Very quiet. They don't bother anyone. VIVIAN: Okay. That works. WASEEM: How is that, Malik? MALIK: A little to the right! A little to the right! WASEEM: Right! Yeah? WASEEM: Good! Lock it! Yeah. MALIK: Perfect. WASEEM: How is this, Malik? MALIK: Yeah! WASEEM: Is it okay? MALIK: A little left. Left. WASEEM: Left? MALIK: Yeah. WASEEM: How is the view? Good? MALIK: It's good. WASEEM: The first one is this. Is it okay? [indistinct talking] VIVIAN: I just need one more minute of your time. I really think it would be in our best interest to focus on what we were talking about. GUIDRY: You're going to tell me what's in my best interest? VIVIAN: Things got heated in there. GUIDRY: You got a lot of passion. We're on the same team, but time is not a luxury that we have. And that hour you just took back there at the end is an hour that I'll never get back. Decisions like this are never as simple as they seem. Hunches and educated guesses will never take the place of real actionable intelligence. VIVIAN: My obsession with catching him started on 9-11. The idea of him just kind of got deeper in my head. I don't know, I guess gradually you could say he... took over my life. I understand our current culture is risk adverse. But I think if you just look at the field data, I'm sure you'd agree that there's more to support this hypothesis than any unsubstantiated cave theories. GUIDRY: Christian thinks he's dead. VIVIAN: He's not dead. GUIDRY: Come on. Keep it coming. Spit it out. VIVIAN: There is a good possibility that by the time we've gathered enough data to validate a static final say, something will leak. He will be long gone and it will be Tora Bora all over again. I believe that if there's even the slightest possibility of his being in there, then we should-- GUIDRY: We should what? VIVIAN: Bomb the [bleep] out of it...sir. GUIDRY: You understand that people will want proof? They'll want to see the body. And a DNA match. Or conspiracy theories will abound. And if we drop a bomb on our ostensible allies in the war on terror, we run the risk of nuclear retaliation on someone, probably India or Israel. We also run the risk of destroying any and all evidence of his ever having been there. Let's reconvene at 0600. We're gonna need a back-up plan. Maybe two. VIVIAN: My college roommate lost her father and her brother in the South Tower. It was awful. And then we go into Afghanistan, and we have Osama holed up in Tora Bora, and we let him go. We had him and we let him go. I didn't wanna be part of the team that let him get away again. REPORTER: Twin car bombs exploded outside the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. REPORTER: ...bombing at the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, claiming the lives of 17 U.S. soldiers. REPORTER: The biggest attack ever on U.S. soil. REPORTER: ...that Osama Bin Laden is behind the attack. REPORTER: Tragedy in paradise as a bomb rips through a resort in Bali. REPORTER: 10 separate bombs ripped through commuter trains and railway platforms. REPORTER: ...hundreds of emergency vehicles... REPORTER: Al-Qaeda is the group being credited for terrorism in the city of London today. CHERRY: So... I finally got to buy my mom a house up the road from mine. It wasn't much to look at, but... that was the best damn day of my life. When she walked through that door, and.... just that smile, you know. And, um, you know, when we come home from deployment, most of the men, they got wife, kids to go to. And me, I just, I keep it simple. You know, it's my mom, my bike... a few girls every now and then. [chuckles] But, you know... even though we go away from each other for a few days, it's, um... we're still a team, you know. The issues that we had out on the field, they're still there. WOMAN: All righty, boys. What else can I get you? CHERRY: I'll have another one of these. WOMAN: All right. TRENCH: Mmmm. Chocolate moon cake. Yeah. WOMAN: You got it. TRENCH: Any y'all wanna share? MULE: No thanks. I'm not a big chocolate guy. TRENCH: Oh, no, no. Correction. A big chocolate guy is exactly what you are. CHERRY: The other night me and Trench were at this bar, right? And this pack of Frog Hogs comes marching in. You remember that? TRENCH: Yeah. CHERRY: And I just kept thinking to myself, "Damn. I feel sorry for the poor guy who's got to pick a wife out of that bunch of buns." I'd have to drink two six packs and put a gun to my head just to go home at night. And then I think, "Man, if I was Mule, I'd be ready to kill myself. MULE: Well, you ain't me. So leave me out of this [bleep]. CHERRY: Sorry, man. How is little Jaclynn? What is she, four or five now? MULE: My kid has nothing to do with this conversation. CHERRY: Okay. All right! We'll switch it to Stunner. Stunner, how is married life treating you, huh? STUNNER: What are you askin'? CHERRY: Just, you know? How is everything on the home front? It's all good? STUNNER: Why would you like to know? You writin' a book, maybe? CHERRY: You got to realize how good you got it. Team leader at 31. Wonder kid flying up the command chain. Why don't you just relax? STUNNER: I'm relaxed. I'm always relaxed. I'm just getting tired of you runnin' your mouth all the time. CHERRY: I get tired of explaining how we let a little old lady blow up D-Punch. MULE: Hey, Skipper. What's up? LT. COMMANDER: Square things up here. Meet me outside. CHERRY: Y'all leave a good tip. LT. COMMANDER: We're still the alert squadron. And I just got word that we're being placed under operational controls of the Agency's Special Activities Division for this op, at Admiral McRaven's personal direction. I don't know the target yet. Whatever it is, it's important to someone. So say goodbye to your wives and kids, your girlfriends, your Harleys, your pets, whatever. Load off you guys at 04. Looks like we may have the opportunity to get payback for D-Punch sooner than we expected. Hopefully you guys have had enough time to get your heads straight. Okay? ALL: Okay. WASEEM: Wait. Hold on a second. MALIK: What? WASEEM: Never mind. It was nothing. VIVIAN: Morning, sir. Vivian Hollins, Senior Counterintelligence Threat Analyst. I was at CTC during Operation Anaconda. Your recon on that mission saved hundreds of lives. If you hadn't taken out that SAM position, it would have been a blood bath. LT. COMMANDER: That was a credit to the men. GUIDRY: We had a ghost detainee, a known Al-Qaeda courier lead us to the suspected location of a high-value target. And the DCI wants us to put an immediate action plan in place. We've opened the file and started the planning cycle. The HVT is in a walled compound. The main building is surrounded by 12-foot walls, two gated and guarded entry points. No telephone lines, no Internet. Trash is incinerated. Kids are home-schooled. STUNNER: How many kids? GUIDRY: 13, maybe 14. LT. COMMANDER: It's a goddamn Madrassa. There are at least seven armed military age males in the compound. GUIDRY: This structure here on top of the main building looks like it could have been designed as a station for some sort of antiaircraft equipment. And intelligence indicates that the target has access to Stinger missiles. LT. COMMANDER: And there are reports that there are 2,000 pounds of C4 in this main structure, rigged to a light switch. GUIDRY: NRO has a dedicated satellite watching the compound. Since this began, analysts have, on several occasions, recognized the man who appears taller than the rest. Proportional shadow measurements put his height at 6'5". He doesn't seem to participate in daily chores. He just kind of walks around. We've nicknamed him "The Pacer." We've got boots on the ground trying to verify his identity. LT. COMMANDER: Is this a permissive or non-permissive environment? GUIDRY: Non permissive. STUNNER: Capture or kill? LT. COMMANDER: Well, it's a CIA Special Activities mission. GUIDRY: We are comfortable with either outcome. We've narrowed it down to three options. Our job is to present all three to the President so he can make the most informed decision possible. The first option is a joint raid with the host nation. However, there is no way of knowing if the target is in league with the host government. So this operation runs the real risk of his being tipped off. LT. COMMANDER: Option two: helicopter assault. That's where we come in. STUNNER: And how are we in, sir? LT. COMMANDER: DF160. Night Stalkers will handle transport. GUIDRY: We all remember Eagle Claw, 1980 failed mission to rescue hostages in Iran. Poor planning led to two downed aircraft and eight dead. TRENCH: What about tunneling under? It would be a lot quieter than bringing in two birds into a rural environment. GUIDRY: The compound was built in a flood basin. Water table's too high to tunnel. Third and final option is to simply level the compound with a JDAM. With this option comes the added complication of collateral damage and the inability to verify that he was ever there. LT. COMMANDER: But you're still not sure if the target's in there. You're still not one hundred percent. GUIDRY: A hundred percent's hard to come by these days. Stacy. J.J. May I have a word in my office? LT. COMMANDER: About what? GUIDRY: In my office. Have a seat, please. LT. COMMANDER: No, thank you. GUIDRY: I'm sure I don't have to tell you how delicate this mission is... how professional errors can be compounded by secrecy and concealment. However, in my opinion, you are the exception. LT. COMMANDER: I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. GUIDRY: I'm saying that you are the type of man whose judgment I shouldn't have to question or second guess. And this file doesn't say any differently. However, there is one page that is cause for concern. LT. COMMANDER: Which is? GUIDRY: Your wife. But I would expect that you won't let the past cloud your decision making or lead you to put your team into any unnecessary danger. LT. COMMANDER: It's a job. I'm not interested in punishment or revenge. I care about mission success. Getting my men home safely. GUIDRY: So do I. Good luck. [indistinct cheering and yelling] LT. COMMANDER: All right, lovers! Break it up! Break it up! Sauce, you've got a visitor. SAUCE: Hey! Come here. LT. COMMANDER: She's on our team now. Take her through the drills, okay? Just know there's 2,340 other dogs that would love to take her place. You got that, people? You got that? TEAM: Yes, sir! LT. COMMANDER: You think you're so important? You put your finger in a bucket of water, you pull it out, you see how fast that hole fills up. Every one of us is replaceable, including me. CHERRY: If you ain't been out on a mission with us, you ain't trained with us... you can't know how we are. You can't know how we communicate. All right? You just don't. You take Stunner, right? He's a team leader, hell of a soldier. And that just, uh... [chuckles] That don't mean I'm not gonna set his ass straight if, you know, I feel like he needs it. So, no, when lives are at stake, you got no business hidin' behind protocol. You know. STUNNER: You got something to say to me? CHERRY: What? STUNNER: You got something to say to me? CHERRY: I don't think so. Not with a gun in your hand. STUNNER: You know, if you think you should be team leader, you should run off to the CO and make your case. CHERRY: I think you're a good leader. I just don't think you have what it takes to fight this enemy and win. This ain't the Boy Scouts. If D Punch were here, he'd say the same thing. All right. LT. COMMANDER: What are you doin'? Really? If you boys can't reconcile this right here, right now, I need to know right now! CHERRY: We're good. STUNNER: We're good. LT. COMMANDER: Good. You better be. Get out of here. You, stay. What's the deal, huh? You used to be a regular Billy Bad Ass out there, huh? Now you're the weakest link. You're supposed to be the leader of this team, huh? This cannot be in here right now! You need to be right up here! We lose men, good men, but you got to focus. I know why I'm here. And you got to figure out why you're here. And if you can't, then you've got to get the hell out of here... and go home. PRESIDENT OBAMA: There are a lot of things that could go wrong. There are a lot of moving parts here. I'm sending those guys in, and Murphy's law applies and something happens... can we still get our guys out? SAUCE: Seek! PRESIDENT OBAMA: They don't know what they're gonna find there. They don't know if the building is rigged. They don't know if there are explosives that are triggered by a particular door opening. So huge risks that these guys are taking. SOLDIER: Stand up! SOLDIER: One! LT. COMMANDER: Go, go! Move, move, move! Open door! Two on the left! Two on the right! [barking] Two down! Two down! Open door! Next room! Next room! Let's go! Let's go! Down! Down! Get down now! LT. COMMANDER: Okay. Got ya. Got ya. Who shot this woman? Who shot this woman? CHERRY: Uh...my bad! LT. COMMANDER: We get our guy and leave dead women and kids, this mission is a failure. CHERRY: Yes, sir! LT. COMMANDER: Okay, people, back to one. We gotta keep running this thing till we get it right. Watch the hands! Watch the hands! You don't see a gun, you don't see a weapon, you don't shoot! Understood? Let's go! CHRISTIAN: Yo! I'm goin' on a coffee run. VIVIAN: Yes, please. CHRISTIAN: How do you take it? Cold and black with a shot of heroin? Ooh, maybe I'll just bring you a syringe filled with espresso. Rim the cup with Demerol and Valium. VIVIAN: What? CHRISTIAN: What, what? VIVIAN: That's it. That's it. CHRISTIAN: That's how you want your coffee? VIVIAN: No, no, no. No, no, no. That's it. CHRISTIAN: What's it? VIVIAN: The syringe. I'm thinking we do a vaccination drive door-to-door. But instead of disposing the needles, we send them to our lab for analysis. So if we can get a doctor inside, get a Bin Laden kid to participate, get a familial match. Remember when Bin Laden's sister died a few years back? Stateside Mass General? The body was subpoenaed so if and when Bin Laden was caught we'd have a DNA profile to identify him with. What do you think? MAN: Are you serious? Is this a real question? MALIK: It is. MAN: I want Osama Bin Laden captured as much as anybody else. And I know... I know the people of Pakistan do not support Al Qaeda. Well, who has the time? 99 out of a hundred are just happy making two square meals a day, fighting their own demons of poverty, hunger. And I know the consequences for myself and my family. If what I'm about to do is discovered, I'd get killed. WASEEM: Here, stand up. Stand up for a while. Good. It's recording. That's good. Do you have anything in your pocket? It's gonna be fine. You've got the full force and faith of the United States government backing you. MAN: Yes, today. What about tomorrow? [knocking] VIVIAN: Come on. Come on. Get in. [indistinct talking, knocking] WASEEM: How is the transmission? MALIK: It's working. Go, go, go! VIVIAN: Get Guidry. Now. It was an idea. You know, "Let's do a vaccination drive." And then all of a sudden, the live feed is running, and I realize that I'm putting someone's life in danger. GUIDRY: What do you got? VIVIAN: We're in. GUIDRY: Yes, we are. VIVIAN: Pan around. Come on. Let me see the whole place. Christian, do you recognize any of these people? CHRISTIAN: No. VIVIAN: Who's that? GUIDRY: I don't know. [yelling in foreign language] [yelling in foreign language] GUIDRY: Let's get voice analysis. I want every one of these faces I.D.'d. One of these kids must be a Bin Laden. Good work, Hollins. MULE: Come on, man. Come on out here. SAUCE: Oh, look at that! MULE: There we go! MULE: Oh! There it is! Put it down! That was savvy! SAUCE: A bazooka! MULE: That was savvy. That was savvy. Come on. Ugh. Aaaah! STUNNER: All right, all right. Turn that off. MULE: Wait...hold up, man! Hold up! STUNNER: Hit the racks. Get some rest. MULE: Hold on, man! STUNNER: And 3, 2, 1! MULE: Oh, come on, man! Damn! TRENCH: I had next! STUNNER: All right. You got next tomorrow. Let's go! STUNNER: Rank meant nothing to me. Nothing. But it killed Cherry that I was team leader. You know, he doesn't like to take orders from anyone, let alone someone younger than him. CHERRY: He thinks I'm a hot headed redneck, which I am. I think he's a surfer boy, which he is. And, uh... takes all types. [breathing rapidly] TRENCH: Hey, Stunner? STUNNER: Yeah? TRENCH: It's him, isn't it? STUNNER: I don't know. TRENCH: Well, who else could it be? MULE: Could be Al Zawahiri. TRENCH: Nah. No, no, no, no. It's Osama. We're gonna be the team that takes out Osama. STUNNER: Don't worry about who it is, all right? Just worry about completin' the mission and gettin' home safe. TRENCH: I'd like to be the one that puts one right in between the eyes, you know? The $25 million bounty buys a lot of diapers, huh, Mule? MULE: Whole lotta diapers. TRENCH: Oh, yeah. STUNNER: There won't be a bounty. All right? Even if it is Osama. You can't talk about it with anyone...ever. [rock music playing faintly] CHRISTIAN: Okay. Let's say he's not dead. Let's say Osama is in there with his 27 wives, his 108 kids, and his 7 favorite goats. Do we think there is any chance that the Pakis don't know that he's in there? VIVIAN: Of course they know he's there! It's a military town. It's a half mile from the gate of the Kakul Military Academy. CHRISTIAN: Okay. So what are we gonna do when the Pakistani police show up? VIVIAN: We have assets on the ground that tell them it's an authorized operation. The police tell their commander, who tells their commander. And by the time it's worked its way up and down the chain of command, it's Christmas again, and we're back in Afghanistan. CHRISTIAN: Okay. How about their F-16s? We just shoot them down? VIVIAN: We sold them their F-16s. We have on-site video surveillance. They scramble, we move out. CHRISTIAN: How 'bout when they launch their nukes? VIVIAN: It's not gonna happen. CHRISTIAN: Really? You're just so positive about that. VIVIAN: I am, actually. GUIDRY: Christian, what do you suggest that we do? CHRISTIAN: I suggest we get a B-2. We launch a few dozen JDAMs into the compound. Done. VIVIAN: Oh, sorry. Okay. Let's just take it back. So then...you do think he's in there? CHRISTIAN: No. No, no, no, no. I think he's dead. But if we're gonna go down this path, don't put our best Special Ops in an impossible situation just 'cause you think he might be in there. We killed Khalid Habib with a missile. How do we know this isn't a trap? PRESIDENT OBAMA: We're going into the sovereign territory of another country. If it turns out that it's a wealthy prince from Dubai who's in this compound, and we've sent Special Forces in, we've got problems. MULE: The year before I enlisted, I was living in Brooklyn. And there was this party on this roof of my friend's building. Well, I got hammered at this party. TRENCH: I've seen you get hammered. MULE: And I was passed out on the roof, sittin' in this lawn chair, facin' the city. The very next morning, as soon as I opened my eyes, that's when the first plane hit. I thought I was still dreamin'. From across the river, I had a front-row seat to the whole damn thing. TRENCH: I was in BUD/S. Second or third week, I think. I don't know. One day they yanked everyone to the side, and they made an announcement. "We're going to war." What followed was... three days of... [chuckles] Three days of the worst ass-kicking you can ever imagine. 34 quit that weren't quitters. [chuckles] MULE: Not 35? TRENCH: Whoo-wee! I guess 34's my lucky number. MULE: I guess it is. LT. COMMANDER: Gentlemen, we're gonna do some shooting. And we're gonna do more shooting. And we're gonna be shooting some more! Start at fifteen! Stop at three! Two double taps with the rifle. Transition to pistol. Fire or failure. As always, gentlemen, big-boy rules apply. BABY: Nnnyaahh! MULE: Oh, what's up, man? Hey, little man! TRENCH: I can hear you, but I can't see you. WOMAN: Okay, hold on. Let me figure this out. TRENCH: Oh, come on! I showed you how to do it. WOMAN: Hello! CHERRY: Hey, Mama. WOMAN: Hi, babe. It's so good to see you. SAUCE: Hey! WOMAN: Hey, Billy. SAUCE: Hey, sis. Hey, bro. TRENCH: Don't keep me waiting. I haven't seen you in a while. Oh! There she goes! WOMAN: So, what are you up to? TRENCH: Aw, you know. Just getting ready. Getting ready. TRENCH: Pull away! Open opposing doors! WOMAN: He got up at five, so he's... He's tired. BABY: Da-da, I love you. MULE: I love you. Can you see me? TRENCH: You knew I was gonna call you, and you have on your cleaning sweats? WOMAN: I have something else on... TRENCH: Oh, you do? Oh! What was that? What do you got? Oh! Let me see. WOMAN: You need to beg. TRENCH: I need to beg? MULE: Hey, Pop! You had on the space glasses. DAD: We might need a spaceship if you keep clowning me. TRENCH: Open opposing doors! STUNNER: Spread out! Clear, clear, clear! WOMAN: I love seeing you, but, you know, you really need to cut your hair. I'm gonna cut your hair for you. CHERRY: They like me to look like the bad guys over here, so I get to grow it any way I want. SAUCE: You know, just doing a lot of training. WOMAN: You look bigger already. SAUCE: They've been working me out a lot lately. MAN: Ain't nothing wrong with working like a dog. It makes you appreciate the good things in life. TRENCH: Close door right! SAUCE: Breach! TRENCH: Oh, yes. GIRLFRIEND: You like? TRENCH: I love. MAN: When you coming home? TRENCH: Three! Two! One! Execute! MULE: I'll be home soon. I can't really tell you much about what we're doing, but we're doing a lot of training. Uh, a lot of shootin', and, um... you know, we'll be home soon. WOMAN: Okay. Are you staying safe? Being careful? CHERRY: I got the best men in the military backin' me up. It's not gonna be a problem. WOMAN: Thank you for what you're doing. All my friends thank you for what you're doing. SAUCE: Well, thank you, guys. We appreciate that. That's nice to hear. LT. COMMANDER: Nice. WOMAN: I really want you to take care of yourself. CHERRY: Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. TRENCH: That's what I miss. MAN: Hang tough and mind your details, and if nothing else, keep an eye on your six so that nothing happens to you on the dark side. Look after the best part. MULE: Yes, sir. SAUCE: Tell everybody I miss 'em and I love them, and I can't wait to call you guys again. MAN: You take care. MULE: All right. I love you, Pop. GIRLFRIEND: I miss you, babe. Get back, okay? TRENCH: Okay. BABY: Bye! MULE: Bye, baby. WOMAN: I love you. BABY: Bye. Bye. TRENCH: Bye-bye. WOMAN: Bye. STUNNER: You know, in our world, we really have two families. You have your actual family and your teammates. I mean, we're gone 300 days a year. Truth is, we live for it. We're always wanting that call. WASEEM: I'll drive this time. TECHNICIAN: That could be Bin Laden's wife. Don't lose 'em. Let's see if we can get a match. MALIK: Easy, easy. Maintain distance. TECHNICIAN: We've got an eye on you. MALIK: Slow down. Slow. Slow down. Slow, slow, slow. Wait. Stop, stop, stop. WASEEM: You stay with the women. I'll stay with the car. TECHNICIAN: Try to get a closer shot. We need a positive I.D. WASEEM: Malik is following two women on foot. I am following the car. TECHNICIAN: I see you both. We need to see the eyes to get FRS to work. Try to get a little closer. WASEEM: Get aside... you old man! Get aside! [siren] Hello. The police are on my tail. What should I do? TECHNICIAN: Where's your gun? WASEEM: It's in the car. Are you connecting? TECHNICIAN: She is complying. We'll take care of it. TECHNICIAN: Stay calm. Avoid confrontation. VIVIAN: Yeah? TECHNICIAN: One of our assets was just stopped by the Pakistani police. VIVIAN: Get Munter and Pasha moving. I don't care what you do. Just don't let our guys get swept up. WASEEM: This is my license, sir. And this is just for... I have a passion for photography. [speaking foreign language] WASEEM: That was close. Thank you. GUIDRY: Just get him on the phone. I don't care what he's doing. Just get him--we already know. VIVIAN: We need to get a green light. Now! GUIDRY: I'll call you back. VIVIAN: Being obsessed with a target is like having a one-way affair. It's, um...it's secret, and you can't stop thinking about him, but you're always alone. The only question is... how it'll end. PANETTA: Continue your interrogation of the data to see if you can disprove the theory that he's there. GUIDRY: We have two agents whose cover was likely blown. PANETTA: I thought we took care of it. GUIDRY: We don't know. We don't know what the fallout is. We have sources at ISI. But Al-Qaeda also has sources there. Jeez. You'd think two billion a year would buy you a little more allegiance, but we don't know who's working for us and sleeping with them. The longer this goes on, the greater the chance of a leak. That's the bottom line. PANETTA: Across the river, they still think this is a circumstantial case. GUIDRY: Well, it is a circumstantial case, but it's a strong circumstantial case. We now know that ISI is watching the compound. We know that they're protecting him or they have him under house arrest, or whatever. In either case, that's why our operatives were followed. PANETTA: They may be protecting someone. We just don't know who that someone is. VIVIAN: Um, sorry. He's a... he's a 6'5" bearded guy, doesn't use the phone, doesn't use the Internet, doesn't leave the compound surrounded by a 12-foot wall, has a known Al Qaeda courier. So I think we actually do know who he is. PANETTA: Who is that speaking? VIVIAN: Vivian Hollins, Mr. Panetta. Senior Counterintelligence Threat Analyst. PANETTA: Well, Miss Hollins, the President of the United States is gonna be staking his presidency on this call. No one will ever know your name if it turns out badly. [dial tone] GUIDRY: That went well. VIVIAN: If you do not have the go-ahead from the Oval Office, it's irrelevant. Anything you've done, anything you know is irrelevant at that moment, and so that is one of the most frustrating parts about what I do. PRESIDENT OBAMA: At the end of the day, we cannot say definitively that Bin Laden is there. Sending in choppers and actually putting our guys on the ground entails some greater risks than some other options. But it's important for us to be able to say that we definitely got the guy. GUIDRY: We're a go. LT. COMMANDER: Stunner? We're on for tonight. Tell the team. LT. COMMANDER: All right, people, listen up. We are officially executing Operation Neptune Spear. The HVT is Osama Bin Laden. Code name will be Geronimo. TRENCH: What did I tell you, man? I am clairvoyant. LT. COMMANDER: Latest intel tonight is there are at least 30 people in the compound. Many of them women and children. Your job is to secure and segregate non-hostiles. I cannot stress this enough! You must be able to discern shooters from non-combatants. As for the primary target, the preference is no detainees. FBI and CIA will be on hand to assist with chain of custody. F-15 Strike Eagles will be on station. There will be two Chinooks no more than ten mikes out in case we get in trouble with the natives. Apaches will provide gunship support. JSTARS will jam Pakistani radar. If it gets rough, we fight our way out. Rangers are sitting right across the border to help out. As always, we go in sterile. If you get killed, you're stupid. If you get captured, you've gotta get killed first. Make sure your Smart Packs are back here. SEAL Team Orange will ride with Stalker One. SEAL Team Green, Stalker Two. Our enemy here is Al-Qaeda. It's no secret they are not afraid to die. Neither are we. [indistinct talking on radio] LT. COMMANDER: Tonight... we know why we are here. We know who we are. Tonight we fight for something truly greater than ourselves. Tonight we ride. [knocking] MALIK: Who is it? WASEEM: I don't know. [knocking] [knocking] WASEEM: Who is it? MAN: We're here for Geronimo. WASEEM: What? MAN: A game play from Minnesota is coming over later. Good news. We're going hot. Kill the lights, please. TECHNICIAN: JSTARS will begin jamming in one mike. Strike Eagles are airborne. Strike Eagles have reached their ceiling. PILOT: Departing friendly airspace. Here goes. PILOT: Roger that. PILOT: You gonna fire up, boys? PILOT: Zebra in two mikes. Dim your lights. PILOT: Roger, that's not gonna work. [indistinct talking between pilots] COMMANDER: Check the target. Three mikes. Good luck. [dogs barking in distance] [speaking in foreign language] [dogs barking] JSOC COMMANDER: Single uniform, right side courtyard, not armed. STUNNER: We started losing elevation at about 500 feet. CHERRY: The motor starts straining, and then you realize it's not straining; it's just actually not getting any lift. PILOT: Stalker One has lost tail rudder. JSOC COMMANDER: Stalker One, report. Are you hit? CHERRY: You see the ground rushing up at you. MULE: Brace! Brace! TECHNICIAN: Stalker One is down. Stalker One is down. GUIDRY: Eagle Claw all over again. Son of a bitch! JSOC COMMANDER: Stalker Two, use alternate LD. JSOC COMMANDER: Stalker One, report. LT. COMMANDER: Stalker One on ground. SOLDIER: Go, go, go! LT. COMMANDER: We have a chopper down in the courtyard. We have prepared for this and will now be amending the mission. STUNNER: Get to the wall! Everybody line up. MULE: In position. STUNNER: Trench! TRENCH: Break! Return. LT. COMMANDER: Hold position! Three, two, one... execute! LT. COMMANDER: Come on, go, go, go! [indistinct yelling] [baby crying] [barking] Go, go, go, go! Top floor! Top floor! TECHNICIAN: Pakistani assets are outside the compound on crowd control. MALIK: Put the lights up! Put the lights up, please! TECHNICIAN: JSTARS reports Pakistani police chatter. STUNNER: Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire! I need eyes on that target. We don't know who else is in that room! [crying and screaming] STUNNER: Open and close the doors! TECHNICIAN: Paki jets are still grounded. STUNNER: Closed door right. TRENCH: Open door! Open door! TRENCH: Unknowns coming out! Unknowns coming out! MULE: Come on out! [speaking foreign language] [crying] [speaking foreign language] SAUCE: Unknowns coming out. Come out, come out. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. [crying] TECHNICIAN: Paki police are Oscar Tango Mike. [men talking in foreign language] [siren] SOLDIER: Breach! SOLDIER: One. Fire! MAN: What happened? WASEEM: What happened? Even I don't know. MALIK: That's because you make 20 rupees a day. Call Superintendent Mohammad Rafique and ask him. He will fill you in. TECHNICIAN: Pakistani jets are scrambling. SOLDIER: Curtain! SOLDIER: Hold! SOLDIER: Come out now! Let me see your hands! Let me see your hands! [speaking foreign language] SOLDIER: Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Clear! Clear! MULE: Hands! Hands! Let me see your hands! SOLDIER: Moving up! SOLDIER: Unknowns coming out! TECHNICIAN: Pakistani jets are airborne. GUIDRY: Where's our DoD Rep? TECHNICIAN: Eagles en route to intercept. STUNNER: Khalid. Khalid. SOLDIER: Khalid is down! Closed door left! [dog barking] [man speaking foreign language] TECHNICIAN: Pakistani jets are closing in. JSOC COMMANDER: Pakistani jet, return to base or you will be engaged. Pakistani jet, return to base or you will be engaged. Pakistani jets are breaking away. Pakistani jets are breaking away. Pakistani jets are returning to their airbase. [yelling] TRENCH: Closed door left! MULE: Closed door right! LT. COMMANDER: Get down! Get down! Get down! LT. COMMANDER: For God and country, Geronimo is KIA. [weak laughter] CHRISTIAN: Oh, my God! PRESIDENT OBAMA: Tonight I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al-Qaeda, and a terrorist who's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. STUNNER: Gather everything up. Take what you can carry, boys. Come on, let's go. We're outta here in five. Trench, we need to blow this bird. We're not leaving them behind. PRESIDENT OBAMA: After a fire fight, they killed Osama Bin Laden and and took custody of his body. LT. COMMANDER: Get that medic over here. Pull that DNA sample. PANETTA: Give your team my congratulations. GUIDRY: I will. PANETTA: Is Miss Hollins there? GUIDRY: As a matter of fact, she is. PANETTA: Let me have a word with her. GUIDRY: It's for you. VIVIAN: Hello? PANETTA: Miss Hollins, this is Leon Panetta. VIVIAN: Hello, Mr. Panetta. PANETTA: Good work. You called this a long time ago. VIVIAN: Oh. I appreciate it. It's been a long journey. PANETTA: Yes, it has. And you've been a big part of it. VIVIAN: Thank you, so much. PANETTA: Thank you. VIVIAN: There aren't many moments in life when you get to realize that everything you've sacrificed for a goal was worth it. Because that goal is so much... is so much bigger and so much more important than... than any individual. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Tonight we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counter-terrorism professionals who worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome. The American people do not see their work, nor know their names, but tonight, they feel the result. We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation, for they exemplify the professionalism, patriotism, and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country. And they are part of a generation that has borne the heaviest share of the burden since that September day. As a country, we will never tolerate our security being threatened, nor stand idly by when our people have been killed. We will be relentless in defense of our citizens. We will be true to the values that make us who we are. And on nights like this one, we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to Al-Qaeda's terror, justice has been done. STUNNER: You know, looking into everyone's eyes, you could see that none of this had sunk in yet. But then you remember the thousands of people across the world who sacrificed to get us here. CHERRY: It was Skipper who took them two women to the ground. If they'd had a suicide vest, he was gonna take the blast himself... to protect us. STUNNER: You know, a lot of people had their doubts... If he was there... If we could pull it off... And the fact is that he was and we did. [cheering] CHERRY: It's a good day to be a SEAL. It's... it's a good day to be an American. [cheering] THE END
