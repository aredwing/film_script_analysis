He'll no leave the grave... not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad. Your son, ma'am? He must have been a fine lad for the wee dog to love him so. Aye. A fine lad he was. Gentle with all little things, like Robbie here. Now l cannot get the dog to leave here. But it's probably for the best... for l have not got the money to afford a grave watcher. Not much danger here, l wouldn't think, right here in the heart of Edinburgh. They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers... and the daft doctors who drive them on. l'm by way of being a medico myself. -A doctor? -A student. l've been studying under Dr. MacFarlane. That is, l've been studying until today. -Here we are, ma'am. -Thank you. Come, little miss... Cabman Gray will carry you safe enough. -Would you like to give my horse a pat? -Yes. He knows every little girl in Edinburgh. Someday, when you're running and playing in the streets... he'll nicker at you as we go by. l can't run and play. Lass, l forgot that. All the more reason then for friend here to give you a hello. He'll keep an eye out for you. Won't you, friend? There we are. There now, safe in your own wee cab. Now you watch sharp, little miss, for my horse to give you a hello. l would like to see Dr. MacFarlane. lt's all right, darling. Don't be afraid. Dr. MacFarlane? l'm Mrs. Marsh, and this is my daughter Georgina. Dr. Maximillian of Leyden asked me to present this to you. Dr. Maximillian, a very famous colleague of mine. He thought you might examine my little girl. Delighted to honor his request. Come in. Thank you, Doctor. -Born paralyzed? -No, it was an accident. -Was the paralysis immediate? -No, Doctor. She seemed to get better. Then about six months later, she began to complain of pain in her back. How long after that was paralysis complete? Nearly a year. -Any attacks of pain since? -Yes, Doctor. -ls this pain sporadic or constant? -lt comes at intervals. They used to be months apart, but they've been growing more frequent... much more frequent. Tell me, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it? l don't know. -ls it in the middle of your back? -l don't know. -ls it low down in your back? -l don't know. Point to where it hurts. You can at least do that, can't you? This is useless, ma'am. -Please, darling, don't be so stubborn. -Mother, he frightens me. -Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane. -Come in, boy, come in. Perhaps you can do something with this young lady. l can't get an ''aye,'' ''yes,'' or ''no'' out of her. But, Doctor, l only wanted to speak to you-- lt's a chance to test your bedside manner. Take a look at the child. -Are you a doctor, too? -Not yet. You'll be a good one. l know all about doctors. That's a nice chair you have. Useful, too. lt isn't English, is it? What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it? About where it hurts? Why, yes. lt's sort of all around here and then down my legs. lt aches as if l'd been walking an awfully long way. That's funny, isn't it, because l can't walk at all. Would you mind very much if l lifted you onto that table in there? -The child seems to take to the lad. -Yes, she does. What sort of an accident was it, ma'am? A carriage overturned. My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt. -How long ago? -Three years. -Dr. MacFarlane. -Excuse me. Certainly. See that? Fettes, wheel the little girl into the hall. lt seems that Dr. Maximillian is right. The violence of the accident must have disturbed the tissues... and caused a traumatic tumor... a sort of growth that presses on the nerve centers. -But can anything be done for her? -Perhaps. A very delicate operation. An operation which has never been performed before... -but l believe it could be done. -And you will try? You will operate? -Not l, madam. -But, Doctor, in Leyden, in Paris... wherever l've taken Georgina, they've mentioned your name. l've come to think of you as our only hope. Believe me, madam, if l were only a doctor... l'd undertake this operation at once. But l'm more dominie than doctor. l've a school to run. But surely in a case like this, a little child who can never walk or run-- l regret it, madam. But l have the responsibility of training 30 other doctors... to attend a thousand children like your own. Then there's nothing l can say for one small child. l'm not heartless, madam. l have every sympathy for you and for the little girl. lf l were to consent to every operation brought to me... l'd have no time for teaching. That's a great responsibility upon me, ma'am. A great responsibility. Fettes, will you see Mrs. Marsh to the door? -And good day to you, ma'am. -Yes, sir. What do you want to see me about, Fettes? Dr. MacFarlane, l'm afraid l have to give up medicine. Give up medicine? Why, you're made for a doctor, young man. l'm afraid l have to, sir. You see, my father is vicar at Thrums. lt's a small parish. Not much of a living. You're too good a man, Fettes. l'll not let you quit. l'll tell you what l'll do. l'll make an assistant of you. That'll pay your keep and your tuition, too. But l thought only the best students were made assistants. -Aren't you a good student? -But Richardson? Richardson is a fine student. He's got a glib tongue. But you'll be a better doctor. Come along to the anatomy room and l'll explain your new duties. Dr. MacFarlane, l'd like a word with you, if l may. l'll follow you, Fettes. You're not having Fettes for your assistant. Why not? He's a good lad. Bright and able. Aye, he is a good lad. That's why l ask you, MacFarlane. You think it'll spoil the boy. -Wasn't l assistant to Knox? -Aye. Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass? Don't worry. lt'll do the boy no harm. All my gratitude, sir. l can never express it. There'll be satisfaction enough for me in knowing l've trained the great Dr. Fettes. Now, as to your duties. lt's up to you to keep the accounts... and to distribute the specimens to the students. Also, in as much as you'll be living in the house.... Joseph! What the devil are you doing sneaking about like a redskin? Make a little noise, man. Let people know you're about. Yes, doctor, yes. Otherwise l might get the idea you're trying to spy on me. You know where we get the bodies for dissection? From the municipal council. They're the bodies of paupers. That's what the law stipulates... but there aren't enough of them, Fettes. Here, give me a hand. This is heavy. You'll find the specimen in good condition. He was as bright and lively as a thrush not a week long gone. A likely lad, l'm told. -You're a new assistant? -Aye. l'm Donald Fettes. l'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes. -Mr. Gray? -That's right. Cabman Gray. l've had some dealings with MacFarlane in the past, you understand? And l've always gotten on with his assistants... providing, of course, they understand my humble position. Dr. MacFarlane said l should pay you. Of course. That's the soul of the business. The pay. l have no doubt you have the key in your pocket. And the desk is over there. My fee is as usual, 10. Now although it's none of my business, l'd make the proper entry if l were you. Received one specimen, 10. Shall we say from the MacDuffs? A royal name. -Good night, Mr. Gray. -My respects, Master Fettes. And may this be the first of many profitable meetings. Well, well, my boy. Your first meeting with the redoubtable Gray. You can count it a milestone in your medical career. All right, gentlemen, that will do. Settle down. Dr. MacFarlane has asked me to review the points he has just discussed with you. He started with the construction of the ribs and the haemapophyses. l suppose this was your doing, Service? Mr. Fettes. A lady is asking for you. What lady, Joseph? lf you gentlemen will excuse me. Good morning, Mr. Fettes. -You asked to see me, ma'am? -Yes. -l want you to help my little girl. -But l'm only a student. Georgina told me how kind you were to her. lt gave me hope that you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane. l don't know that l can do that, Mrs. Marsh. -But did he tell you about Georgina? -Aye. Then he must have told you that this disease is progressive. That it will grow worse... and that soon she will not be able to move at all? And you won't ask him to help? l didn't mean it that way. lt's just that l'm not in a position to ask favors. Ask this one favor. Of course l will. Georgina was right. You are a kind man, Mr. Fettes. l'll do what l can. lf the doctor says yes, you will find us every morning on the rampart. l take Georgina there for her airing. ln an adult, this muscle can apply more than 175 pounds of pressure. Double that and you have the full strength of the human jaw. That, gentlemen, is to chew our food and bite our enemies. Here, Fettes, life can't be all skittles and ladies. Yes, sir. Well, l see it's time for our luncheon. l've a bit of beef to discuss. So l leave you to whatever arrangements you've made to serve the inner man. Well, Richardson, l see you have that arm you've been yearning for. Yes, sir. This fellow would've been a great one at hurling the bar. He has a beautiful bicep. Burke and Hare could never have got the best of him. -What did you say? -l was just making a joke, sir. lt's a poor subject for jest. Particularly for a medical student. What did you say to His lmperial Highness? Nothing but a merry word about Burke and Hare. There's nothing in that to get excited about. They're dead and buried. They killed his wee doggie, too. Little Robbie. Come in. Fettes, where have you been? l didn't see you at the afternoon session. l don't think that l can go on, sir. What the devil do you mean? You've got your lodgings and a certain stipend. l thought l'd arranged everything for you. l saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night. That man took the body from Greyfriars. l knew the woman. l knew the little dog on the grave. He killed the dog. And that's why you won't be a doctor? Not if l have to be a party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane. Fettes, l was an assistant once. l had to deal with men like Gray. Do you think l did it because l wanted to? Do you think l want to do it now? But l must and you must. lgnorant men have dammed the stream of medical progress... with stupid and unjust laws. lf that dam will not break... the men of medicine have to find other courses. You understand me? -Yes, but this woman and her son-- -l'm sorry for the woman... but her son might be alive today... if more doctors had been given the opportunity... to work with more human specimens. As for me, l let no man stop me when l know l'm right. When l know l need... those lifeless subjects for my students' enlightenment and my own knowledge. And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor... you'll see it as l see it. Penny pamphlet on the Duke of Wellington. Good evening, gentlemen. How are you? We'll have a stiffener or two of hot rum. Then we'll meet this fellow on fairly equal terms of warmth, eh, Fettes? A fine specimen, isn't he, Toddy MacFarlane? Come, Toddy, sit down here with me. Don't call me that confounded name. Well, then, Dr. MacFarlane. Though l've known the time, Toddy, when you liked the name. Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it. Rough and wild ones they were, too. But sit down, Toddy, with your friend. Mr. Fettes and l have professional matters to discuss. Medicine? That'll keep. Sit down. You wouldn't want it said of you that you refused a glass to an old friend. We'll buy you a glass, Gray. l'm a pretty bad fellow myself, but MacFarlane is the boy. Toddy MacFarlane. Why don't you order for your friend, Toddy? No, on second thoughts, l'll do the ordering. We'll have a bowl of hot punch and a cut from the loin of that young porker. Don't worry, waiter. l'm with my friend. The great Dr. MacFarlane. He wants to sit here with the commonality. You were going to speak of medical matters. Don't let my humble presence stop you. Talk on, Toddy. l will not have you call me by that name. You will not have it? You remember the lady who came to see you yesterday, the lady with the little girl? l remember. She came again today and wanted me to ask you... if you wouldn't break your rule and operate. -She feels that you are her only hope. -So she told me. -l'm a teacher, not a practitioner. -A teacher? -Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor. -Afraid? Of what? Afraid you're not as good a doctor as you make out to be. -l'm the best man for the job. -Why don't you do it then? l'd like for you to do the operation, Toddy. You? Since when have you become the protector of little children? lt's not the child l'm concerned with, Toddy. lt's you l'm thinking of. l'd like to have you prove... that a lot of things l know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any. -l'll not do it, Gray. -Oh, yes, you will. You'll do it to oblige Mr. Fettes and myself. No. Maybe there's some private reasons between you and me that'll make you. Some long-lost friends, Toddy? Say you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here. lt might be an interesting case. That's a good boy, Toddy. You only want me to do it because l don't want to, that's it, isn't it, Gray? -Toddy hates me. -Don't call me by that name. Hear him? Did you ever see the lads play knife? Toddy'd like to do that all over my body. We medicos have a better way than that. When we dislike a friend, we dissect him. You'll never get rid of me that way, Toddy. You and l have two bodies. Aye, very different sorts of bodies. But we're closer than if we were in the same skin. For l saved that skin of yours once. And you'll not forget it. After he thought about it, he said it might be an interesting case. -You have his promise, then? -Yes. But there'll be great pain connected with it, ma'am. During the operation and afterward. -Great pain and shock. -Pain and shock. She's brave enough, but l don't know about myself. Now that it seems so close... l wonder whether l dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Ma'am, if you'll allow me, l'd like to give you cause for courage. Dr. MacFarlane is a great man. l think he's the greatest man in medicine. God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure. Thank you, Mr. Fettes. Over here! Mommy! Mommy! -Take me to the wall. l think l hear him. -Hear him? The white horse that's going to greet me when he sees me. An old acquaintance? Now you put your arms around me, and we'll go up and see that horse. lt was a brown horse, Mommy. A cabbie told her his horse would say hello to her the next time he saw her. Georgina's been looking everywhere for that horse. Why do you want the white horse to bid you good day, Georgina? He was a nice horse. Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina? Of course l don't have friends. That's because l can't walk. l try to make myself used to it, though. One shouldn't get used to the wrong things. You want to walk and run and play? Really, l thought you at least would know how much Georgina wants that. Aye, but l wonder how much. -l want it so much. -But you'll have to stand great pain. Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness. -Do you want it that much? -Yes. Then, Dr. MacFarlane will make you well. Gray's head. ls that it, Toddy? ls that what you broke just now under the poker? Broken it and have done with it forever. My poor lad. My poor, poor lad that can never be free of him. You're daft. What's Gray to me? He's only a man from whom l buy what l need when l need it... the rest is forgotten. You may deny him, Toddy... but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead. Nonsense. You're a fey creature, Meg, with mad ideas. And you have a wildness that holds me to you, my lass. No great lady can ever take my place? Come in. Well, Fettes, l didn't expect to see you on Sunday. What do you want? Some powders for that aching head? That was a furious lot we drank last night. And in bad company. lt was about last night l wanted to talk to you. About the operation on the little Marsh girl. You're a man of the world. You wouldn't hold me to a promise given in drink. But l.... You see, sir, l met Mrs. Marsh and l told her. Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding. -But you did promise. -Look here, Fettes... not l nor anyone else... knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies... to ensure a successful operation. l'd have to study the matter. Have we any subjects? No, Wilmont used up the last spinal section. There you are, you see. Thing's entirely out of the question. Yes, l suppose so. Do you know where Gray, the cabman, lives? Thank you all the same. Come in. lt's the young doctor come to see me. l'm honored. Come in. Here, sir, take this. lt's the most comfortable chair. To what do l owe the honor of this visit? Some business, was it, of Dr. MacFarlane's? Dr. MacFarlane didn't send me. l came of my own accord. What are the chances of your being able to get us a subject? That'd be difficult. Very difficult. There was a dog that bothered me during the last job. People are so concerned about dogs. All in all, it raised the very father and mother of a row. They say the kirkyards are to be guarded. l wouldn't want to say it'd be impossible to get a subject. But how soon, man? Dr. MacFarlane is engaged in some very urgent research at present. -He can't wait very long. -l fear he'll have to. But can't you give me any idea? How could l? l'll do the best l can. After all, you see, l am financially interested. You may tell Toddy l'll do what l can when l can. As he knows l will. But he must wait and see, like the children do. Well, if that's your answer, l suppose it'll have to do. There's bad news, boy. Bad news. We have to go out again. There, Master Fettes. Sooner than we thought. A stroke of luck you might say. Good. Why, that's the street singer. l know her, l tell you. She was alive and hearty only this evening. lt's impossible she can be dead. You could not have gotten this body fairly. You are entirely mistaken. You had better give me my money and make the proper entry. Good night, Dr. Fettes. Good morning, young Master Fettes. Dr. MacFarlane... you know the street singer who sang ''When ye gang awa, Jamie''? Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one. This girl was beautiful. -A wild lassie from the Highlands. -Beautiful, you say? lt's a wonder l haven't noticed her. Oh, this girl. Dr. MacFarlane, she was murdered. l went to see Gray last night. l asked him to bring us a specimen. On my way, l saw this girl. l gave her alms money. She was alive and singing. -Well? -Gray killed her. -We can't be sure of that. -l am sure and l mean to report it. lt's like Burke and Hare all over again. l wouldn't do that. l wouldn't report it. Grave-robbing is one thing. This is murder. l don't know that. Neither do you. This subject may have been an epileptic. Thrown a fit... fallen out of bed, cracked her skull, and killed herself. There's everything explained. -That bruise on her forehead. -l can't believe that. Believe it or not, it's best that you pretend that you do. After all, you ordered this subject... received it here and paid for it, that makes you a party to murder. lf it was murder. -But l didn't ask him to kill. -Who would believe that? And then, you know, someone else might recognize her. She was as well-known as the Castle Rock. No, l think we should do what we always do. Dissection. l'll help you, of course. l want the whole centrum myself for spinal work. You know why. Have a drop. lt'll help. l couldn't swallow. -How long has it been? -Only 20 minutes. Only 20 minutes. Now you must watch closely, gentlemen. Closely. lt's the very heart of the matter. Wait, Doctor, the child's fainting. Good, so much the better. She's unconscious. -Pulse? -Slow, not too alarming. Let us proceed. And the final step. We push the ganglia to one side... then we make the actual osseous incision here. So... it's done. The repair is effected... and nothing left to do but replace the tissue. Let nature heal what is no longer a defect... merely a wound. Bravo. l'll be finished with her in a second. Then you can consider her your patient, Fettes. Doctor. What the devil's the matter with you? Everlastingly creeping about. What do you want? -Mr. Gray wants to-- -l don't wish to speak to Mr. Gray. Tell him there'll be no more business between us. Good afternoon, Toddy. Well, it seems that l shall have the pleasure of speaking to Mr. Gray myself. You can go. Now that wasn't a friendly thing l heard, Toddy. Not at all friendly. That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection. lt's better for the students and that's the end of the matter. Well, you know what you want and what you don't want. And there's the end of business between us. But we'll still be friends, Toddy. l'll be stopping by once in a while to see you and Meg. For auld lang syne. l suppose l can't prevent that for auld lang syne. And do you think you're getting rid of me, Toddy? -l would like to speak to you. -l presume you shall. -This won't be my last visit here. -l want to speak to you alone. -l saw something. l heard. -What did you hear? l know.... Maybe some other time. You'll have ample opportunity. Ample. -Good afternoon, Master Fettes. -Good afternoon. l just saw Gray. What was he laughing at? He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs. l've been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly. The incision has healed clean and fine... but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk. As soon as she's ready, you bring her to me. l'll show her. Dr. MacFarlane, l wonder if you know... what happiness you've brought to those people. That's the way of it, Fettes. You bring the lassie to me. Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina? You can't find him from a wheelchair. You have to walk and run to find him. -l can't. -You can't, you can't! Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let her stand up and walk. Her spine's all right. l know it's all right! But she must want to stand. She must want to walk. Confound it, the child's a cripple. Of course she wants to walk! Child, l say to you, get up out of that chair and walk. Child, l ask you to do a simple thing. Raise yourself with your hands to a standing posture. Then step out with your left foot. Try it. l say try it. Lift yourself up, now. Good. Now step out. -Step out! -l can't! l can't! My legs won't move. Nonsense! They will, they will. l'm sorry, Dr. MacFarlane. Georgina's a good child, a brave child. You saw how she behaved during the operation. lf she says she can't move, she can't move. But she must be able to move. Everything is in place. She would if she could. Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child. Something l don't know. Something l can't define, can't diagnose. l can do nothing for her. Fettes, you see Mrs. Marsh home. l'm going to Hobbs'. You can join me there later if you want to. Yes, sir. Well, l'll be off unless you have a fare for me. Some gentleman a little taken with his wine. MacFarlane will want to be freighted home. -The Dr. MacFarlane? -Aye. He's in the other room getting stiffer than the bodies he demonstrates. l'll look in on him. Toddy. lt's you, Gray. Come in. Have a glass with me. You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. -More like the old days. -l want someone to talk to. That Fettes who is all taken up with the widow.... He never came back here. Gray, you know something about the human body. l've had some experience. Then you can understand this. The backbone is a lot of little blocks... and those blocks are all held together so that it works. Works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you? l've never had it all explained by so learned a man. l set those blocks together, patched the muscles. Put the nerves where they should be. l did it and l did it right. She won't walk. lt's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about. The same. Look here, Gray. l fitted them together like this... so that it was right. Yet, she won't walk. You can't build life the way you put blocks together, Toddy. What the devil are you talking about? l'm an anatomist. l know the body. l know how it works. You're a fool, Toddy, and no doctor. lt's only the dead ones you know. l am a doctor. l teach medicine. Like Knox taught you? Like l taught you? ln cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow? The heart pumps it. Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go? And why things are remembered and forgot? The nerve centers, the brain. -What makes a thought start? -ln the brain, l tell you. l know. You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from Knox or me would you learn those things. Look at yourself. Could you be a doctor, a healing man with the things those eyes have seen? There's a lot of knowledge in those eyes, but no understanding. You'd not get that from me. l am a doctor, l tell you, a good doctor. l could make her walk, but she won't. Here, have another glass, MacFarlane... and l'll take you safely home and we'll be friends again. Now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend. Aye, forever. l'm my own man and l'll have no more to do with you, Gray. Why should l be afraid of you? What are you holding over me? l'll tell you what. l stood up in the witness box and took what should have been coming to you. l ran through the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears... and the mob yelling for my blood because you were afraid to face it. -Yes, and you're still afraid. -No, l'm not afraid. Tell. Shout it from the housetops, but remember this: they hanged Burke, they mobbed Hare. But Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London. Aye. -There's something in what you say. -There's much in what l say. lf you have any regard for your neck, you'll leave now. And stay away from my house, my school, and from me! l have no wish for a rope cravat. l never liked the smell of hemp... so l'll bid you good night, Dr. MacFarlane. Dr. MacFarlane's man, a surprise visit. Come in. Come in. You're welcome to my little nest. Joseph, is it not? Yes, that's right. -You had something to say to me? -Yes. Something very private? That's very interesting. Take a chair, Joseph. -Can anyone hear what we say? -Only Brother. l know you kill people to sell bodies. You say you came here of your own account? No one sent you? No one knows that you are here? Give me money... or l'll tell the police you murder the subjects. Joseph, you shall have money. Why should you not? l don't suppose the great Dr. MacFarlane is over-lavish with his pay? -No. -Here, have a glass of this. You want money and you shall have it. Let me see. Five, and five. And then in gold, six. -Shall we say 16, Joseph? -Yeah. l have made you give me money, but you smile. -Aren't you angry? -No, Joseph. l'm not angry. Here, some more brandy. l'll wager it's better than the doctor's. Drink up, man. l have an idea. A splendid idea. So excellent an idea that we must drink on it. You see, l admire you, Joseph. lt took courage to come here and l'm looking for such a man. But drink, Joseph, drink. You and l should work together. You mean, we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? -To dig them up? -There'll be no digging. The kirkyards are too well-guarded. We will, so to speak, ''Burke'' them. ''Burke them''? -You're lately come to Scotland, Joseph? -Yeah. l come from Lisbon. But you may have heard the chapbook singers and peddlers of verse... cry their names down the street. You know. The ruffian dogs, the hellish pair The villain Burke, the meager Hare Never heard of this song. What did they do? Eighteen people they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox. 10 for a large, 8 for a small. That's good business, Joseph. -But where did they get the people? -That was Hare's end. You should have seen him on the streets. When he saw some old beldame deep in drink, how he cozened her. ''Good day to you, Madame Tosspot. ''And would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? ''Come with me to my house and you shall be my guest. ''You shall have quarts to drink if you like.'' How he cozened them. We can do that. But when he'd get them there, then what? Nor did they handle axe or knife to take away their victim 's life No sooner done than in the chest they crammed their lately welcome guest l don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it. l'll show you how they did it, Joseph. l'll show you how they ''Burked'' them. No. Put your hand down. How can l show you, man? This is how they did it, Joseph. You've no need to be anxious, Meg. MacFarlane's been drunk and away before. He'll be back in good time. Meanwhile, you have me to keep you company. l'd call that no good fortune. There was a time, lass... a time when l used to bring the dashing young doctor to your door. When you weren't so uncommon cold to your old friend Gray. -Why must you be at him all the time? -He's my friend. l like to see my friends. l like to visit them. He's come home. You've no excuse now to bear me company. Gray, what are you doing here? Haven't l told you-- Would you grudge me a glass with me old crony, Meg? -Crony indeed. -Get out, Gray. l brought you a little present, MacFarlane. -ln very good condition. -l've ordered nothing from you, Gray. -But this is a gift. -And l take no gifts from you. This is a gift you'll not refuse. Gray, l told you to get out. Wait, Toddy. That's not friendly. l want to discuss business. You are not to set foot in this house again. For business or any other reason. And you're getting out now. l wouldn't do it, Toddy. l wouldn't be heavy-handed. lt might become known... that when the great Dr. MacFarlane finds his anatomy school without subjects... he provides them himself and from the midst of his own household. What the devil are you talking about? Take a look downstairs, Toddy. Take a look downstairs. -Where is Fettes? -l'll get him. Fettes, were you down here when Gray came? No. Bring that candle over here. A member of his household. The more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with the street singer. Complete dissection. A proper entry in the book. -No. -What do you mean? l'll have no more of it. l'll not put my neck into a noose. Not even for your sake. Don't be a fool. You can't begin and then stop. Because the entry of the girl's body is in your writing, you'll do as l say. As for me, l'll attend to Gray. -You're not going to Gray. -He must leave me alone. No! No! Come, Mistress Cameron, this is no place for you. l'll help you upstairs. -You must leave this house. -l can't do that. You heard MacFarlane. Save yourself, Master Fettes. Look at MacFarlane. But he's a great doctor, a great man. ls it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? ls it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife? So that l must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success? He could have been a great man, a good man and a fine doctor. But there was always the shame of the old ways and old life to hold him back. And Gray. Gray to hound him to his death. You're overexcited, Mistress Cameron. l'm cold as ice. But Gray's only a resurrection man... who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again. lf he were only that. The man's Evil himself. Someday you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him. For MacFarlane was to Knox as you are to him. That's how he met Gray... and roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There's all that between them and more. Burke and Hare and Knox. But that's long since. Gray can't threaten him with that. Gray has no need to threaten. -Do you remember the trial? -l heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. lt was a famous case. Do you remember the porter who testified against Burke? Aye. They didn't tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box... when the king's counselor pressed him hard. How he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence. That porter was Gray. And the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it... who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray-- -MacFarlane! -Listen to me, Fettes. l'm one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane... and one part fey. You're a Lowlander, Fettes... and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the ''second sight.'' -l've heard of it. -lt's a gift to my people. And l see MacFarlane and Gray. The pit yawns for them. l would have you away from them and safe out of the torment. -This is unexpected, Toddy. -l wanted to see you. You weren't here, so l waited. -What do you want of me, Gray? -Want of you? l want nothing of you, Toddy. Gray, l must be rid of you. You've become a cancer. A malignant, evil cancer, rotting my mind. So you've made a disease of me, Toddy? There's only one cure. l must cut you out. l'll not leave here until l have finished with you one way or another. l'm going to be sure that l'm rid of you. And if there's no other way-- Surely you're not threatening an old friend. We've never been friends. Here, Toddy. -Have a drink of something good. -l've drunk enough tonight. Another little drop will never do you any harm. You're getting old, Gray. And it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet, windy streets of Edinburgh. l have other means of sustenance. The resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come. What l was going to say is this: wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house? Would you bribe me to let you be? l'd make you rich. That wouldn't be half so much fun for me as to have you come here and beg. Beg? Beg of you? You crawling graveyard rat! Aye, that is my pleasure. Very well, then. l beg of you. l beseech you. But then l would lose the fun of having you come back and beg again. But why, Gray? Why? lt would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. -You're a pleasure to me. -A pleasure to torment me? No, a pride to know that l can force you to my will. l am a small man, a humble man. And being poor, l have had to do much that l did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps to my whistle... that long am l a man. And if l have not that, l have nothing. Then l am only a cabman and a grave robber. You'll never get rid of me, Toddy. Let be, Toddy, let be. l have no wish to hurt you. No, Toddy, you'll never get rid of me. You'll never get rid of me. Don't force me to kill you, Toddy. My pride has need of you. That's better, Toddy. That's more reasonable. -Where's Fettes? -He's gone. l sent him away. l'll not see another boy made miserable like you, Toddy. -You've been with Gray. -Aye. You'd better look at the face. Look at it, Meg. l'm rid of him forever. He'll not come here again, sneaking and whining and bullying. Now he'll serve a good purpose... and tomorrow when the last bit of him is dissected, demonstrated... and entered in the students' notebooks, then at last there's an end to him. Next day, l'll take his horse and cab to sell at the Pennycuick Fair. Then, not a trace left. Rid of him forever. No, Toddy. You're not rid of him. -Good morning. -Good morning, Mr. Fettes. -l thought this was a school day. -l'm not at the school anymore. -l left last night. -Left Dr. MacFarlane? Play by yourself a little while, darling. l'd like to speak to Mr. Fettes. This is serious, Donald. What's happened? lt isn't because of Georgina, because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure? lt's not the failure. l feel that l've learned nothing from MacFarlane. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy... but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine. Mommy. l feel that MacFarlane had me on the wrong road. A road that led to knowledge, but not to healing. lf there had been any healing in the man, Georgina would be walking now. l think it was the pain of the operation more than anything else. Mommy, it's the white horse. l'm sure it's the white horse. She's afraid that if she stands, the pain will come again. Nothing that Dr. MacFarlane could ever do would take that out of her mind. Mommy. l can't see over the wall. Georgina, you're standing. You'll not need that again, Georgina. l wanted to see the white horse. l've got to tell Dr. MacFarlane. You will not believe it, but the child has walked. Stood and walked. l must tell Dr. MacFarlane. -He's not at home. -Where can l find him? You don't want to find him. Your news will keep until l tell him. But l must tell him. He must know of it. Please tell me where he is. There's no standing between a fool and his folly. lf you must babble your news to him, he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. -lt's the inn at Pennycuick. -Pennycuick. l know the inn. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig. He'll welcome the ride back. l'll be there in an hour. No matter how much you tried... you couldn't get the better of old Angus, the horse dealer. A sound horse, a closed carriage. And after l'd talked to him a bit, l got his price down to 4.10. And worth every bit of 10. Surely, Angus, a man who had won so great a victory in a horse deal... would buy the poor loser a drink. Piper, let's have a song. The man who bought your horse... would like you to have a glass of French brandy at his charge. Now that's very civil of him. Doctor. The little Marsh girl stood and walked, really stood and walked. -What's that you say? -The little girl, she couldn't walk far. The muscles were too weak, but she did stand and she took a step or two. l knew it, l knew it. The moment l was rid of him. -Who? -Gray. l'm rid of him. What do you mean about Gray? l've been able to induce him to leave Edinburgh. He'll bother me no more. Drink. Here's to a good riddance. Now that he's gone, l'll be a new man, Fettes, and a better teacher. The doctors from my school will perform miracles. Still your song, lads. The MacCreadys are here. They've come from burying their sister in Glencorse Kirkyard. Glencorse, that's a lonely cemetery. -Not a soul around for miles. -Those people will be thinking of that. l'm not worrying about them. lt's our own ends l'm thinking about. You've no thought of going there? Gray is not the only man who could handle a mattock and shovel. -l've had some practice in the art. -You couldn't do that, Doctor. l let no opportunity escape me. l've a whole new course of lectures for you fellows. We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along. -No. -Why not? l must have subjects. lt's the only way l can teach, the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people. The idiocy of their laws shall not stop me. Nor will they force me to deal with reptilian creatures like Gray. We can do our own dirty work and we will. Let's go. Let me take over, Fettes. So we can't do without Gray. So l'll never be rid of him, eh? -You want to put it in the back? -No room there. We'll have to set it between us. Fettes. Keep it off me, will you? Fettes. Toddy. Toddy. Toddy. Toddy. Toddy. Toddy. Toddy. Toddy. Toddy. Toddy. Whoa ! What's the matter? -Did you hear something, Fettes? -Nothing but the wind. Come on. You'll never get rid of me, never get rid of me.... You'll never get rid of me, never get rid of me.... Never, never, never, never! Whoa ! Whoa ! Fettes, let's have that light. lt's changed. Fettes, l swear it's changed. -Changed? Changed to what? -Hurry with that lamp. This is not a woman. Hold that lamp up. l must see her face. Gray! Dr. MacFarlane! Gray! English
