I can only say that our soldiers... - Any casualties? - Why the shooting? Was it an assassination? One of them protected me with his body. - Is he wounded? - Did he survive? Thanks to him, I'm here now. - Are you all right? Will you make a statement? Please do not film the unloading. We have a few wounded but their lives aren't in danger. Our soldiers showed extraordinary heroism. If they're only wounded why are they covered? They are special forces. Their faces are never shown. I was standing there, five meters away from them. The guy who took this picture suddenly fell down... and a Jeep with a machine gun came around the corner... so we started to shoot. Later we learned that none of the refugees had been killed... and that woman gave me this pot out of gratitude. Oh, it's only a rib. - Broken? - It doesn't hurt. Yes? I remember. No, nothing like that. Of course I do. I shave everyday. I'm telling you that you... can't do this legally. I don't want it to be legal. I just want it to look that way. Hey buddy, where to? Where do you think you're going? He has an appointment. What's that on your head? - My hairdresser was drunk. - John, show him out. You won't find anybody better for this job! Four years in the special forces! He protected people with his own body! He's had some problems, but everybody drinks from time to time. He drinks everyday, you can see it in his eyes. How could you bring me such trash? It shows a lack of respect. Can I have a drink before I go? Give him a beer and throw him out. - I don't have a gun. - Good, you'd only hurt yourself. Wait. Stop shooting, for God's sake. What an idiot! I heard you. We had a deal, didn't we? To guard me means to show up before they kill me, right? The car wouldn't start. You should have told me. I would've bought you a new one. See if he's still alive. I think he's dead. The son of a bitch is asleep. I'm taking him home. He'll puke all over the car, boss. Where am I going to find a lawyer as good as you? You'd like one like that, wouldn't you? What is she doing here? She wanted to go dancing. Here, in this whore-house? This place is good for thugs, thieves, and corrupt cops. You were supposed to guard her, not take her out dancing. I figured if she wanted to dance, better to do it near you. Starting tomorrow you're the new gardener. Get out of here. What stinks? You puked in the car and I had to clean it up. Leave us alone. Can you tell me why you debased yourself like this? I had some family problems. I can help you out. I can call the doctor to give you an Antabuse implant... or I can put half a liter of vodka into your IV. Put in a liter. Christ, Doctor, at least give me an anesthetic! Go and call Sara. If I tell her, she won't listen. Why don't you go, darling? Go call the boys for dinner. This is the man who'll be driving you to school. Couldn't I drive someone else? I'll never shoot a cop in uniform. Sure. What about undercover cops? Why is he alone? Because I'm good, pal. Boss, talk to him. Buy him something big, better make it a shotgun. - What the hell for? - Because it's big. Give me a break Leon. We're both in this for the money. - But I'm not staff. - That's why I earn more. I want two legal guns, a Colt and a Beretta. The doctors won't let me drink vodka or eat fatty food... but they allow me to drink wine. Did you know that the French have... the fewest heart attacks? - The house is poorly guarded. - I'm not a connoisseur. I just know that you drink red wine with steak. The best wine I've ever drunk was Bulgarian Sophia... right after the Chernobyl explosion. - Don't worry about a heart attack. - That's enough! Somebody'll come here and kill you. What happens in this house is none of your business. I have some problems right now, but I'll manage. All I want you to do is drive my daughter to school... bring her back... and go home. She's in good hands here. Do you understand? So if she's hurt on this side of the fence, you won't blame me? - Exactly. - But you'll feel a little sorry. What if, for example, something happens to her... when she has one leg on this side of the gate... and the other on the street? Do you really want me to lose my temper? Just trying to determine the scope of my responsibilities. I just wanted to pour you some. It's a very good school. I need someone who'll make sure that all she does is study. I don't want her to know that she's threatened. Is she threatened? When she was born, I was sorry she wasn't a son. Ten years later I was happy she was not a boy. Nobody killed women then. But now times have changed... and a few of my competitors don't have sons anymore. You don't trust those thugs of yours, do you? You need an outsider. But I'm a drunk. I'll get drunk and shoot her myself. The doctor assured me that if you drink a glass of vodka, you'll die. Besides you're the only guy who's not doing this for money. Really? You're doing this for yourself. You won't let her get hurt, whatever the cost... that's why I hired you. I asked you not to get out of the car every time. I can open the door myself. If you keep smoking in the car, I'll die of lung cancer. The girls say I have either a bodyguard or a lover. - I'm just a driver. - You scare my boyfriends. The one from the Chicago Bulls isn't afraid of me, is he? He'll be playing in the NBA, you'll see. If he paints himself with shoe polish. Let's get something straight. I already did, with your father. You're just like the other bastards that work for him! Did you think I wasn't? Stop, I want to get out! - Yes, I understand. - I didn't know you could read. I burn them in the fireplace. Some drunk set fire to the trailer. We can go back. - Do you have anything to drink? - No. Just a driver, huh? Put this on. We're not leaving here until you put on the jacket. - It'll wrinkle my jacket. - So take it off. All right. Enough of this. I want to leave. I'll call the neighbors. Help! Help! Fire! They've heard worse things. I don't know why you're here. I swear on my mother's gray head, it was just a cigarette butt. There are lots of hoodlums around... Go home. Do you have to smoke so much? The car stinks. I have a nerve-racking job. Isn't he overdoing it a little? I understand he's afraid... but he'll end up telling us to lock the girl in a safe. Do I protect her or not? Make up your minds. But she doesn't want protection. She says you're weird. If I was normal, I wouldn't be here. Then maybe he can drive and I'll protect her? Go and tell Sara's mother to bring her here. I told him to call you because I got information... that they're trying to get to me by using my daughter. I don't think it's true but I won't risk it. I've been trying to come to an agreement with them. I'm hoping we'll make peace in the next few days My dear, I'd like us together to think about what we should do now. Simple, hire a tutor and pull her out of school. What?! I have a few problems right now, darling, but... I'll try to resolve them and you'll be able to go back to school. No way, the boys have a game tomorrow. If they win, there'll be a dance. If you want to keep me home, put bulletproof glass in the windows. They're already bulletproof. Put these earphones on. You want me to wear them during the game? If you don't stick them in your ears, you won't go to the dance. Maybe I ought to put on a bulletproof jacket too? Yes, but then you wouldn't be able to dance. So you'll have to stay close in case someone tries to kill me. Yes. Do you want to go in the girls dressing room with me? Time out! Cezar, come here, now! Go back to the car and drive around the school. I told you that you only needed to be a driver. You were right. One, two, three. I'm freezing out here. There are bandits and thieves all around me... They're about to rape me... I hope. You can listen in the car. My bodyguards have disappeared; I'm sure my dad'll fire them. Want to dance with me? I'm not a good dancer but I wanted to tell you something... - What? - I don't know where to start. But I can learn to dance if you want me to. Then come see me when you learn how. Hey baby, come on, sing along. - Is it my fault that my father... - No. Leave. Christ, you wrecked the car. Get her out of here. I love you... I think. Ow, the rib hurts. The rib, the arm, and there's some buckshot in your ass. But the doctor said you'd be up and about in two days. I hate doctors. They say cirrhosis of the liver will kill me, but I feel worse... since I stopped drinking. - You'd better stay in bed. - Mind if I take a piss? Wait, I'll help you. - You want to hold it? - I'll help you find it. Tell Jozef that I need protection - and don't let her come near me. I'm sorry. Not only will you soon lose your pay but you'll have to buy me a bottle for bringing you out alive. I would've left you. Me too, but Sara got hysterical. She started screaming that you did this for her. I had to put you in the back seat and clean up that fat slob you shot in the street. You were lucky he was aiming at your back, and not your head... because at that distance, he would've blown your head off. He was aiming at the head... Sara's. Remember when we shot The Sausage? He was really heavy too. The boss caught him in front of a butcher shop. I remember how his guts spilled all over the pavement... and how Jozef put his cigarette out in them! That's enough. I was seventeen and I remember it as if it were yesterday. I dream about it every night. Really. In color, or in black and white? How did Sara get the car keys? I'll go and check on the lawn. Aren't you worried that one of your gravediggers has the hots for her? No one dares touch her. They know I'd kill them. Besides I've got you. No, no, I'm leaving tomorrow. Haven't you ever seen a sleeping bodyguard? You can't go away. Sure I can. Please. You can't leave me alone. Why not? I'll never do anything stupid. I'll only listen to you... I'll do whatever you tell me to, just please don't go. Take off your clothes. I was kidding, go away. But you won't leave? Promise that you won't leave and then I'll go. You were supposed to do what I say. What are you doing here, dear? Promise me that you'll always protect me. Darling, call Sara. I want to show her off. Gentlemen! My daughter attends the best private school. She's going to study law in America and when she comes back... the smartest guys will be fighting to have her working for them. But I won't let her go. I'll make her my right hand in my legal business. Gentlemen... My daughter! Let me give you a hug, sweetheart. Let's drink to her health. Her father's true pride and joy. Is that why you tried to have me killed? Oh, honey, that's not true. Your sources are misinformed. I admire young people who say what they think. When they go to university, they'll learn to lie. Drive! What are you waiting for? You're a dead man... I'm begging you! Don't shoot! You're dead, and I decide when it happens. Not today, OK? If you even think about hurting the girl I'll find you and kill you. Nothing will stop me. Do you understand? - Yes. - No you don't. If the girl falls down and breaks her leg... - you're dead. If she gets pneumonia, then I'll kill you. You can shoot everybody in this country, but she is sacred. - All right. - No, not all right. I'll also kill your wife, your sister and her children... and then I'll cut your mother's throat; I know where she lives. My mother hasn't done anything to hurt you. The driver's in the trunk. You sons of bitches! Is that the way Jozef makes peace? I'm not working for Jozef. I'm working for her. If I see you here again, you'll be singing in the opera. Anybody want any party favors? They're free today. What did you say? With these it's easier to screw a girl... you dance better, you're not afraid of the teacher! I want some. - Take a big hit, it's faster. - I'm scared. Then go see your girlfriend, or go see a priest if you don't have one. - What are you doing? - After this he'll be even more scared. Somebody call an ambulance! They're aspirins with vitamin C. I've got pockets full of them since I had to go on the wagon. God bless you. He already has. You know that even a little sip will kill you. I want two Johnnie Walkers, two Ballantines, four Napoleons and twenty beers. - I want to go to your place. - You like it that much? I could call my father and tell him I'll be home late. Ask your father to buy it for you. Then you can come anytime you want. - But it'll be expensive. - I'll be your woman. Where are the fish? You're the kind that looks but doesn't touch, eh? A test of your willpower. How can you walk with this on? I've gotten used to it. Let me stay. Why are you sitting there like the little match girl? I'm going to stay here. I'll ask your father to take you out of school. A woman knows who her man is. You're not a woman. But you'll make a woman out of me. - Get dressed. - I am dressed. You can throw me out, but I'll come back tomorrow. You don't have to make love to me just let me stay. I'm throwing you out. I love you. I didn't know it was so easy. I'll be with you forever. I know I'll have your children. Look, the mob there is civilized, not like here. Here, he sells drugs in front of his own daughter's school. I don't control dealers. I'll put the word out that if they sell drugs in front of school... I'll shove enough drugs up their ass to give them constipation. - Do you believe me? - Yes, I do. Drugs are for idiots. Who forces them to buy? Do I put a gun to their heads? When you were a child did you take drugs? No, but you weren't in town then. I have a Russian test today. Are you worried? No. Heads or tails? Heads. - Don't you regret burning them? - I don't have any hot water. Have you read them all? Yes, a long time ago. Now I like the cinema better. Was it good for you? It's because it was my first time. I want you to do it again. To lay on me and to be inside me. I want to feel what a woman feels when making love with her man. I'm not your man. It didn't hurt at all. Not even for a moment. My mother told me that if you love the man you do it with it doesn't hurt at all the first time. And I love you. You just think you do. Love is something that doesn't really exist. It's something that makes mercy disappear. It's like building a house and burning everything all around it. Love is listening at the door to hear if those are her shoes squeaking on the stairs. Love is when you whisper baby to a woman forty years old, when you watch her eating even though you can't swallow a thing... and when you can't fall asleep until you touch her. Love is when you're standing under a tree together and you wish it would fall over so you'd have to protect her. And when somebody wants to hurt her, you shield her with your body? No, then it's just a job. You can't keep skipping school. Let's do it again. Stop it. I'm not sure I had an orgasm. You did. I have this book... "How to have regular orgasms until you're ninety. " I just don't know why they call it a guide for lonely women. What's so funny? You know what? What? Throw that book away. You only had four hours of lessons today, I checked... Haven't you heard about extracurricular activities? I have a chance to get an award for the best grades this year. I went to the Zacheta gallery with Leon and I have a speech to give tomorrow. One of my girlfriends, said that Matejko was a famous Polish basketball player. Thanks, son. It's none of your business. Do you think my lover will like this? I really don't know. May I try it on? You let her get away with that? Want to see? My hands have to be free. So how much longer, doctor? That long? I feel that this implant is going to fall out. Are you sure? I think it's stopped working. No, I feel it instinctively. All right, I won't worry. There's no reason to worry, is there? Thank you. Which one do you like better? Neither, they both make you look older. How about this? You look better in the red one. The one with holes. Come over here for a minute. What for? I don't deserve to be treated so impolitely. Look, so young, and she has to fuck that dirty Italian. As I remember it, she fell in love with him... Yeah, sure! The punk found her in a pasture and bought her like a goat. Christ, I'm really glad that we live in Poland... I could take anything except somebody doing that to my daughter, I'd go crazy! She's my only child, you know? We know. Listen I trust you. If you see that something's wrong, that some punk is hanging around her, let me know, all right? There is a guy hanging around her. A big guy. Couldn't you take her out of that school? She could learn the same things here. Will a tutor give her a diploma? Please, I won't be able to keep an eye on her there. Try to understand, Sara has to finish school. I need it, and so does she. I once told her that I'd give her a wonderful husband. Do you know what she told me? "That's obvious, Daddy". And that's why I love her. She's at a difficult age now but we'll work it out together. You'll help us, won't you? Do I draw well? These drawings are staying here. If I ever take them away I won't come back to you... but that won't happen because I believe in relationships - that last a lifetime. - Whose lifetime? Even elephants love each other for years... and scientists have proven that whales... - Do I look like a whale? - Your fishes do it, too! But in water! We're not going to raise baby fish... Matejko's last exhibition... was at the Zacheta Gallery in 1921. I didn't know that. Then you'd better learn. Then I better go to school. Will you tell me if you love me... even a little? I can't give you my coat. And you can't hug me, can you? Now you can't hold me even though five minutes ago... you burned my school book because you didn't want me to freeze. And now, out here and nearly to the car, you can't warm me? Great soup, darling. I was just telling Leon that nobody cooks as well as you do. That's true. Great soup. The last time I ate soup like this was in the Golan Heights in 1980. Darling, do you know what's going on with our daughter? Nothing, I just feel sick. - Maybe you have indigestion? - I feel like vomiting because I'm pregnant. A great joke for Sunday dinner. I can't seem to finish this house. Yesterday I got rid of ten workers. Did you bury them in the garden? No, I just fired them. You think she's fallen in love? With whom? With you. She'd have to call you Daddy, or Uncle. You're like a piece of antique furniture to her. Do you know that next year I'll be more legal than President Kwasniewski? You mean you'll get your Masters'? And I'll need a business partner... Don't make me laugh. Someone who's not in the business, who's absolutely honest and whom I can trust. A friend. I'm going home. Wait! I haven't finished. Find somebody else to take my place. Why not put some fish in here? We'd have something alive... Everything has to end sometime. No. We love each other. I love you. Then you have a problem. Please... Why do you hurt me? - How was the test? - Fine. For you. How do you know I like them? I know a lot. I know everything about you. I know how tall you are, how much you weigh, what your shoe size is, and your bra... - I even know when you have your period. - Did you go through my things? - No way. You prefer him to drive because he's more handsome. More handsome? And a little intelligent, huh? He took you to an exhibition of Matejko's paintings... But you're more subtle. - Really? - Yes. That was supposed to be a joke. I'd like to go somewhere. No, Jozef won't let us. We can go back home and ask him and I'm sure he'll let us go. OK. And this Leon, he's a psychopath, you know. I heard he accidentally killed his own daughter. Hey! Where? Dad... He's been waiting for you, listening at the door when anyone went up the stairs. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. Well, you've seen me. I miss you. See this? What? Gray hair. Can I touch it? Why can't a forty-year-old man love a sixteen-year-old girl? And why can't a man in his sixties love a twelve-year-old girl? Dad, stick to the fish. I've already told you, you don't have to love me. All I have to do is sleep with you? I wasn't so lucky when I was your age. Shut up, dad! - We'll live with your father? - You'll think of something. Beat it. Get lost. Either you're not my son, or you have your mother's brains. What were you doing there? And what about you? I was just walking down the street. There's a Picasso gallery there, he's a painter, you know. But I could've driven you there. I asked him but he said that daddy wouldn't allow it. That's not true. It was a brown Pontiac Fiero. It'll be easy to find. Sara, excuse us for a moment. But this is my room. You have to come back; we need you. Will you? It's all because of that kid. This basketball player keeps hanging around her. Give me a break Cezar, go get some sleep. - But at school... - You idiot! This is the second time you've lost the car keys! But Sara took them. I want you to find out who tried to run her over. I have to know who the target is before we start shooting. Don't you want to talk first? I guess not. It's a shame you don't have a big bathtub in here... one we could both get into. There was a Jacuzzi here once. Your wife took it? I drank it away. She didn't take anything. She had a lover fifteen years younger then me. She used to fuck him when I was away. Now I know that I was doing penance for you... just in the wrong order. Did you catch them? No, my wife couldn't decide whether to leave me, so she was very careful. So I helped her. I left my gun on the table and one of my daughters picked it up... Quiet... I don't want to know any more. I've already accepted that it was an accident. You could call it an accident. I know you don't want to talk about it. Why not? Today it seems very funny to me. Funny? My daughter took a gun and shot my wife's poodle, her favorite one. By accident. My wife couldn't stand it. That horny little you know who... had lots of money and took her to Switzerland. I begged her to come back but she said I'd always remind her of the poodle's brains all over the wall. Have the girls written to you? No, I think they prefer their new daddy. Don't say that. Now you clean this place up and I'll cook dinner. Where did you learn to cook like this? Out in the world. Two of our cooks were killed. Will you teach me? What for? I like cooking. And we'd like to be alone, OK? - Where's the photographer? - It's self-service today. Are we going to do it... here? With all those people right outside? What are we going to do then? Take pictures. And now like this. Get dressed right now. Jesus, where's the rest of the class? They told us to see it on our own. We've found the Pontiac. It belongs to your friend's father. Your basketball team captain. The punk hasn't been in school for the past week. Didn't I tell you? He's broken-hearted. When will you be home? Late, I still have some lessons and French. At least put your dress on the right way. What's sort of damn fad is this, wearing everything inside out? Your pictures. You have pictures? Show me, all right? No, not all right. Why not? Fine, but I'm sorry you won't. Here you are, it's an even 1800000? Great! Almost like yours! When did you have your last period? Quieter... Was it when you didn't want to make love... and broke a vase filled with ice-cream over my head? You weren't yourself then... just like a real woman. I see you're really wound up. Did your mother ever tell you, you know, how to avoid having children and such things? What things? You have to think about it if you don't want to get pregnant. But I want to have children... All right, but how to have them when you want them, and not have any that aren't wanted. Let me explain. You can make love everyday until the sixth day before ovulation, and you can't do it for three days after ovulation. After that you can, but it's not certain because the sperm can still be viable. Do you feel good? You know what? I'll draw it for you. It's a very good method, the Church supports it. Why don't we order something else? Oh, I forgot the most important thing. To find out when you ovulate. You have to use a thermometer. Fuck your yellow mother. There are a lot of things you don't know about me. But I know perfectly well when I ovulate. Really? Thank God, because I still don't understand it at all. I have to tell you something. Well... Chinese food is the best in the world! What? Careful, I'm good at this. Go through the kitchen to the back door. I'm staying with you. I'm not planning to stay here. Move it! Can I go back for my bag? - I arranged it all. - What? I asked my friend to pretend that he wanted to run me over. He said he still loved me. - Fuck, they'll kill him. - They'll see he's just a kid. Don't you dare call him. What's his address? 10 Bzowa street. I want you to come back. I'm at home. They said he was hit by a car. It could've been an accident. I didn't know this was how it is. I didn't want to know. One day in Bosnia I was protecting an old man. Two guys wanted to kill him. One guy hit me and the bullet broke my rib. He had an old pistol, so I was lucky. The other guy was shooting at us with a Kalashnikov and my friend wasn't lucky because the bullet pierced his bulletproof jacket. - What happened to them? - Who? The guys who wanted to kill you. They didn't want to kill us. We were just standing in their way. You protected that man with your body, didn't you? Yes, I was blind drunk. You do stuff like that all the time. You told me the story to make me understand, didn't you? Did something made you sick? You're doing this for money. That's your job, huh? They pay you a lot. What difference does it make? - Did you warn him yesterday? - No. You're just like them. You decide who lives or dies. Come to my father's place at 1:00 p. m. Tomorrow. We're flying to Paris in the evening. Why are you taking those drawings? There are still a few great guys left in the world and if you look hard, then in a few years, you'll find somebody as witty, intelligent and charming as I am... and he'll be younger. Forcet that he'll be worse in bed. Sex isn't all that important. No. Why? I'm sixteen. I have to grow up. Don't be so grown up, all right? I'm not grown up and that's why I'm going be alone now. When my father was your age he burned a German tank! I love you but I don't want my child to have a father like that. Come tomorrow, OK? Red - pregnancy, green - nothing, pink - who knows. Will you drive me to school today? What about Leon? He's not coming. - I finish at three. - I'll be here earlier. It's fifteen minutes fast. Why don't you help me? Where are you two going? To Africa. Professor Bartezi has a research base there. I was there on a scholarship, remember, Dad? Sure I do, and I bet he remembers when you ran off to hunt poachers. - Felt sorry for the elephants, huh? - No. I'm a racist and I didn't like the Masai. We'll send for you, Dad. We'll go to Zaire and you'll catch fish the likes of which the world has never seen. Nothing doing, son. She's not coming. She'll come; she loves me. I'd like to be as lucky in life as you are. Not the fish! Dad! Jesus! Leon! Come out, now, or your old man gets another dose of buckshot, hear me?! I'm coming out! Hold it! First the gun, then you! Dad. Dad! Call an ambulance. Tell me it's only trick photography. You think you can't love a sixteen-year-old? How could you have been such a son of a bitch? That's what I can't figure. That's because you don't go to the movies enough. It happens all the time in films. Call, hear me? He's still alive! Just don't tell us you'll kill us for this. I'll kill you for this. Dig! We're very sorry but your daughter didn't want us to bring her here. She jumped us and then hit the wall with her head. She went nuts... look at this. Thank you. You liked shielding her with your body? Did she scream, or just talk? She never mentioned you. Give it a rest! The boss just told us to beat the shit out of him Let me go. Are you nuts? Now we'll have to bury him. Let the taxpayers bury him. How could you? What? How could you be so irresponsible? Tell me what this bastard did to turn your head around? Nothing, it was me who wanted it. You wanted him... to... I begged him on my knees to fuck me, if that's what you mean, and when he did, I wanted more. We did it every day. Sometimes we stayed in bed for days! Stop it! I love him, Dad! She's pregnant. I've changed my mind, kill him. Well, you know... He saved my life and I saved his, once. Now I want him dead! I think we've already killed him. You think? Everything will be fine, dear, your father will get over it and... Take the money from the safe and go to the Canary Islands. Mom... I don't want to see you here for the next two weeks! You'll marry her. I'm a Catholic. I can only marry a virgin. I'd rather keep cutting the grass in front of the house. If that's what you want. Call the doctor. They didn't find him, did they? You did the dumbest thing you could have. The only consolation is that it may be the last time. That's not funny. I'm not saying you didn't kill him, but you shouldn't have killed his father. Now it's personal. Find him. He'll show up himself, faster then you think. You should have that looked at. It's a birthmark. I wanted to know if my father was brought here. Your father is dead. I'm sorry. The surgeon who operated on him will be here soon. Please wait. Hello, sweetheart. Please don't do this to me. You'll thank me for this someday. Is it over? She kicked me in the nose. Either I have normal work conditions or I say goodbye. So put her to sleep! No, she has a weak heart. It could hurt her. Oh Jesus! Exactly. - Where's the son of a bitch who's guarding the gate? - Send someone No, he's not that stupid. Make sure Jozef doesn't leave the house until... Don't do it, I'm a cop. You're not wearing a uniform. If you kill a cop, they'll hunt you all over the world. That's exactly where I'm going. Maybe you're not pregnant? I just said I was because I wanted to upset my father. You probably don't know it, but I studied psychology too. You don't know how to lie. You're too late! I saw the doctor scraping your whore! - What did you come here for? - For my woman. She's in the room where she spilled the soup on you. - Did I make it in time? - Yes! - Jesus, you're drunk. - Yep. I told you the house was poorly guarded. Move out of the way, dear. This gun shoots a wide pattern. I once got 7 ducks with one shot. You ordered them to hurt me, Dad. You said yourself that you don't forgive harm done to the family. Give me a break, that's what Italians say in low- budget movies about the mob. I do not forgive. I'm a gangster's daughter and it's in my blood. I wanted to save your life, your career. I wanted to save your youth, for you to remain a little girl. No one stays a little girl around you. Besides, you killed my man's father. Let's get out of here. Sara... come back here right now. I don't know if I'll find a job. I'm lazy and get bored quickly. I don't mind. I think I'm a drunk. I'll drink everyday and enjoy it. If that's what you like. I can't show my feelings and I rarely buy flowers for girls... - actually, never. - That's OK. I hurt the people who mean the most to me. I'm patient. Excuse us for bothering you, but we got a call that shots were heard in the neighborhood. It's a quiet area, no one has fired a gun here since the war. - What do you have in this bag? - Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Great joke. Excuse me once again, and have a nice walk. Forget it, it no longer concerns us. Do you really have two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in the bag. Actually, it's four hundred thousand. Would you like to have a fish farm in Africa? I'd like it if you didn't have to shield people with your body. What did you say? Open your eyes. I've seen guys survive worse wounds. Listen! Wait! No, you can't fucking die. Don't die, hear me? Don't do this to me! We'll go to Africa and we'll raise fish. Do you know how much Germans pay for one fish? Forty marks! Child, we'll have a child. You have to live, understand? What have I done so bad that you're going to leave me alone? You know I can't live without you! If you leave me now, I'll kill myself, do you hear me? And if you wake up now I'll be with you forever! I'll be with you until the day I die. If you like, I'll count to three and you'll open your eyes. One, two... I love you, my little girl. Did they really have to kill me before you could tell me that? It's the same one. Third time in the same rib! I think I'll have it removed. Get up or we'll miss the plane. Don't worry, I'll always protect you. If you want a lover I'll do anything you want. And if you want another kind of love I'll wear a different mask. If you want a partner, take my hand... if you want to hit me in anger, here I am. I'm your man. If you want a boxer, I'll step into every ring. And if you want a doctor, I'll examine every inch. If you want a father for your child... or only want to walk with me across the sand... I'm your man. The moon's too bright, the chain's too tight. The beast won't go to sleep. I've made so many promises... that I couldn't keep... I could beg on my knees for you to come back, to no avail... I could crawl to you, baby, and grovel at your feet... Rip your heart and tear your sheets, I'm begging you... I'm your man. I'm yours, little girl. I'm yours, all yours. I'm your man.
