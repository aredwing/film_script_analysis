Give me your requirements. Tomorrow for a conference in Mumbai... ...our delegate is coming from Rajasthan. We need escorts for him. You know, like a personal secretary. I will forward you the number of our agency's escorts. Her name is Jia Rao. You can give her the details of your guest. Hello! - Is this Jia Rao? We got your number from Alfa agency. Yes, Jia Rao speaking. Look, I am calling from Legacy chain of international hotels. We need an escort for our guest... ...who is coming from Rajasthan tomorrow. Sure, but there is a problem. I don't know Rajasthani. That should be okay. Okay. You message me the name of the guest and the flight details. I will reach the airport to receive him. Can't you sleep? I can't sleep on the floor. And if I see somebody walking over me... ...then how will I feel? What's the matter? Your boyfriend's message, so late in the night? Read this! Boyfriend's message! Mr. Vikram Aditya Singh Shishodiya! How many men are they? Flight KF 903 from Jaipur at 8:45 am. Are you going as an escort? - Yes! And we are going for dinner tomorrow night. What about that? Shall we go after 2 days? This guest will return to Rajasthan by then! Okay! Thanks! Do me a favour! Please! Give this chart book and papers to Kanchi! And tell her that I will come for tuitions 2 days later! Okay, my multi-tasking friend! Thanks! Oh! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Come on! Mr. Vikram Singh! Welcome to Mumbai! Looking for me? Were you expecting someone else? No, I... actually I was told that the guest is from Rajasthan. Right. I am from Rajasthan. Born and brought up there. It means... I don't know Rajasthan. - No. Like I don't know those who walk with an empty trolley. Oh! O my God! How silly of me! I mean... Hey! What's wrong with you? - Sorry! May I take your bag, sir? - It's okay. I will take care of it. Today's schedule. Breakfast after checking in. Conference at 11! Nariman Point at 4! Got that? - Yes! By the way this trend of escort is quite new here. Yes. You people don't face any security problems? At times you meet difficult people. I go out all prepared. For instance... if somebody misbehaved then this pepper spray. Straight in their eyes. If this didn't work, then I have a backup. Chilli powder! If I still face any danger, then this knife. - Are you serious? And then... my revolver. - Is that loaded? Dummy! - I am impressed! Thank you! By the way you made a mistake... ...by telling me all this. Now I know everything. I know you are not like that. Want to bet? I lost. Thank you! Hello! - Hello! Mr. Vikram Singh Shishodiya! We have a booking! Sure! Yes, Malini. I had called. Some urgent work. My folder... on my computer... all the photographs in the folder... ...mail me all of that. Yes, I will need it for the presentation. You know which folder I am talking about. Yes, all the jpeg, mail me all of that. Go to folder A. Yes, that's the one. Yes? - What are you doing here? I am taking a bath. - Yes, but why are you taking a bath here? So where else shall I take a bath? Go and take a bath in your room. - This is my room! Look, this is our room! As you can see... - Excuse me! Can I see that please? - Yeah! Sorry. Sorry, you can take a bath. This is just the serial number. The room number is written here. Princess suite. Let's go. Yes, I will talk. Just tell Mahajan to be in touch with me. Just one minute. Can you get me a meal of white omelette... ...some bacon, sausages, some orange juice... ...and cheese. Don't forget the cheese. Yeah, Malini. I will call you as soon as it's over. Okay. Will you get it? Yes, I will get it. But what, sir? Breakfast! Oh! I am sorry, sir. I thought you were talking on the phone. Enjoy your breakfast. I am sorry, sir! I think those who trained you to be an escort... ...they have taught you only to say sorry. Because you don't know anything else. You don't know how to find the hotel room. And you don't know how to serve breakfast. And you don't remember that you have to... ...remind me about the I am so sorry, sir! Home away from home. Legacy chain of international hotels. Shallu! - Yes, Jia darling. Tell me. You were talking about dinner today. Let's go. We will go. Will you be able to come? I think I will reach home within half an hour. I have lost my job. What are you saying, Jia? I will come home and tell you. Okay. You decide where you want to go. Okay. Okay! Okay, fine. Bye. Thank you. I didn't want to tell you downstairs... ...in front of everybody. But I know. You are intelligent. You know what I want to tell you. I know. I have lost my job. I hope you don't mind my saying this... ...but being an escort is not your cup of tea. It's a different kind of confidence. I am not saying that you are not confident. Its just that... they are different kind of girls. You know what I mean. You are right. It's not my cup of tea. These High heels. I don't wear all these things. But I have to wear it. Because this was the only secured job. But you are right. I made a mistake. No excuses. Why don't you pursue your studies? Tell your parents to support you. They would have supported me completely. They would have sent any amount of money I wanted. But there is a small problem. Their currency doesn't work here. Why? Where do they live? In heaven. - I am sorry. I give tuitions. So there is no problem that if I lost my job then... But thanks for the advice. Goodbye. Excuse me. I have not asked you to leave. Oh! But obviously sir, I don't know my work. So why will you stop me? To give you a few tips on your secured job. So that next time when you are an escort... ...you don't lose your job. I will be your escort for a day. And you be my guest. After a day's training, I am sure that... ...your job will become permanently secured. Shall we begin? Well ma'am, what's your schedule for today? You have to reach Nariman Point at 4 o'clock. Not me... you have to reach at 4 o'clock. And it's late. So shall we go? How about some chocolates on the way? Sure! Let's go. - Thank you. Come on. After you. You are giving me too much attention. Then I am doing fine. The guest should always feel that... ...the escort is giving him full attention. Please, now stop it! When guest says that then the escort should double his efforts. Here we are! Sir, flowers! - Yes. Take this. Keep it. - Thanks. Thank you. Here. For you. Shall I put it? No, I will wear it later. - Oh! Okay! If I asked you something, you won't mind? The guest can ask the escort anything. He won't mind. Are you flirting with me? Are you still upset with me? I met Anamika for the first time here. Anamika? - My wife! Oh! You are a married man. I was. She died. I am so sorry. So... how was I as an escort? A big failure. What? It's true! Neither can you accompany me! Nor can I accompany you! So tomorrow... what about tomorrow? What do you mean? I mean... will we meet or not? There should be a reason to meet. If there is no reason then find an excuse. - Like what? Think at night and tell me. Okay. So... did you think of something? No. I went to sleep. I bet you didn't sleep at all. Not at all. Am I right? You don't want to answer me. Fine. Now I want to answer those questions... ...which you want to ask... but... you can't ask. Did you sleep at night? - No, Jia. I couldn't sleep. Why? Well, obviously, I was thinking about you the whole night. Oh, really. What were you thinking about me? Well, I thought of the excuse for meeting. Oh! Seriously? - What's the excuse? Will you marry me? Are you ready to get married? Beloved! Darling! I search for you everywhere. My blossoming heart. My blossoming heart. My blossoming heart. To endure the pain of separation. It's difficult to stay away. Come and meet me. My blossoming heart. My blossoming heart. My blossoming heart. In the craving of fervour. You dwell in my feelings. My heart is immersed in your thoughts. You have made me crazy. I thought of you. I loved you. I asked for you. I got you. I have won you. My blossoming heart. My blossoming heart. My blossoming heart. Beloved! Darling! I search for you everywhere. My blossoming heart. My blossoming heart. My blossoming heart. My blossoming heart. My blossoming heart. In two days nobody asks for a kiss. And he directly proposed you for marriage. Jia, I think something is fishy. Maybe you don't understand... That's not so! I... Ask her! She has experience! It has happened twice with her! These people only talk of marriage. Then they sleep with you and walk away. Right? Come on, let's take his interview. No. No. I will do whatever is to be done. What is to do? Go and tell him, sorry. Refuse him. What will you say? So Jia... welcome to my city! Have you ever come here before? I had thought someday I will surely visit Rajasthan. But I will come here this way... I had never imagined that. I am happy. Sir! Let it be! He is mad! This road goes straight. But there is another route. I have never taken it before. But today I want to take it with you for the first time. Here it is. My beloved. My beloved. My beloved. Welcome to my city. Welcome to my city. Gajner. Our home. Oh my... So huge! ...beloved. So make a small home here. Welcome to my city. Come. Carefully. Good evening, sir. Good evening, ma'am. Good evening, Mahajan. Sir... today you came by the lake route? Nothing. Wanted to try it once. - Okay. Jia, Mr. Mahajan! Gajner's old manager. This is Jia. - Hello! Hello! - How do you do? Come, Jia. Sir! Ma'am is an official guest or personal? Very personal. Well, Jia! The resort which I was talking about... ...it will be built here. What do you think? - Good evening, Mr. Vikram. Malini! Welcome back! Thank you, Malini. Jia, she is Malini. She is everything to Gajner. She is responsible for making this place an international resort. You have returned with such a guest whom you can't tell... ...that we have been friends for the past 25 years. Of course! I grew up in front of her! Just kidding! Actually Jia, we grew up together in Gajner. Jia? Well, I am really bad with introductions. Why don't you guess? Alright! Let me guess! A new interior designer for Gajner? Fantastic! How did you guess? Please meet my wife Jia. What? How can you do that? Why? I mean is this the way to get married? No joy and no celebration in Gajner! I have got married once that way too, Malini. Welcome back, sir. Good evening, ma'am! How are you, Narayan? - Fine, sir. It's your grace! Thank you! Here! - Thank you! Cheers to my wife! Oh! - Sorry! Never mind! It's okay! - But I do! You did what you had to do. It's my turn now. Mahajan! - Yes! - Its time to celebrate! Welcome to my city. Dance! Dance! Dance! Come! Come! Dance! Dance! Dance! Come! Come! Dance! Dance! Dance! Come! Come! He has come! He has come! He has come! He has come! He has come! He has come! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! So what do you think of Gajner? My entire hostel can fit here. - Hostel? YWCA! In Mumbai, I lived in YWCA! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! My bangles felt coy. My bracelet felt nervous. My bangles felt coy... - This is your first marriage, right? ...My bracelet felt nervous. - Yes. It's Vikram sir's second marriage. - I know. Maybe you don't know that there is... ...so much difference between his first and second one. My heart is beating fast. My heart! My heart! My heart! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Come! Come! Come! Come! My veil is covered with stars. My skirt is embellished with gems. Kohl adorns my eyes. My friends have dressed me up! My friends have dressed me up! They did it! They did it! They did it! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! That's the west wing. There Mr. Vikram Aditya Singh... ...and his wife Mrs. Shishodiya used to live. Nobody lives there after her death. And now nobody is permitted to go there. Dance! Dance! Dance! You can surely love him a bit less... but be more loyal to him. Today is the day of union. I am craving. My trembling body is fragrant. Youth is young. Lovingly in his arms, beloved... Lovingly in his arms, beloved... Took me! Took me! Took me! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! He has come! He has come! He has come! He has come! He has come! He has come! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Dance! Dance! Dance! Come! Come! Are you happy? - No. Why? Everything feels like a dream. So will you love me in your dream? No. I will love you less... ...and I will be loyal more. 'I will love you less and I will be loyal more.' I don't know what happened to him. He left suddenly. Where is the way to exit? You go to your room. But Vikram... - He won't come tonight. But what did I do? I want to talk to him that... When he leaves in anger then nobody is permitted to go to him. I am not nobody. Even Mrs. Shishodiya was not allowed. Your room is there. Good night! Good morning, Jia. Vikram! - I am really angry with my staff. Nobody told my Jia that in Gajner people sleep on the bed. And not on the chair. Even in the hostel I would sleep on the bed. And not on the chair. But I don't know why last night... ...you got angry with me and you left. And I... I am sorry. I am really sorry about last night. Let it be. Are you angry with me? Anyway! I have an important business meeting to attend. You have your breakfast and start your day. And in the evening Vishaka Devi... ...and her husband are coming to meet you. Oh! How funny is that? After marriage I am telling you that... ...the only other person in my life is my elder sister Vishaka. And her husband Shekhar Rajput. Shekhar is the police chief. He is not as capable as he thinks. They will have dinner here. So will you take care of it please? And now that we have got married... ...consider this house as your own. Love you! Excuse me, ma'am! What are you doing? - I... Narayan! You please sit there. No, please keep this plate here. You sit there. Come. Sit. Excuse me! Narayan! Narayan! Ma'am was serving her own breakfast! Had Malini found out, she would have fired us. Ma'am! - Yes! Narayan! He will serve you breakfast every morning! Okay. - Ma'am, what would you like to have for breakfast? Sausages, bacon with white butter toast. Fish with honey and olive. Ma'am, if you want to begin with salad... ...then we have Italian salad and Russian salad... ...with all kind of toppings. If you would like to begin with Indian breakfast... ...then we have three kinds of idlis and porridges. We have 5 varieties of eggs. Scrambled, milk omelette, tomato omelette... ...half fried and boiled. And in drinks, ma'am, soup, juice, milkshakes... ...coffee, piping hot tea. - And of course desserts. What would you like to have for breakfast, ma'am? Toast and coffee... please. I think the order is clear, Narayan. Serve her. There you are, ma'am! This is today's newspaper. - Thank you. Did you enjoy the breakfast? - Yes, it was very nice. If there was any dearth, then let me know. As such a large spread is available in the marriage party. All thanks to Mrs. Shishodiya. Here there was always an ambience of party. - Is that so? In India maybe you are the only person who doesn't know... ...about these parties. Twice a year. For such parties even page 3 was... ...not enough to print the snaps of this party. Come. Let me show you. The party was held here. Celebrities from all over the world who were... ...Mrs. Shishodiya's personal guests used to be here. All the guests would be in mask. So that we couldn't know who had come and with whom. So that there is no controversy. Singing, dancing, commotion. Drinks, eateries. For many nights. Gajner used to feel alive when Mrs. Shishodiya was there. Would you like to sit in the hall or library? Anywhere. After her breakfast Mrs. Shishodiya... ...used to begin her day with the library. Giving instructions to staff, all the social phone calls... ...appointments... Where is the library? Hello! - Mrs. Shishodiya! I am sorry. Mrs. Shishodiya is no more. Ma'am! It was the chef's call from the kitchen! Oh! - He wanted to ask about this evening's dinner menu. I am sure you know that some guests are coming in the evening. You tell me. I will inform in the kitchen. Whatever is normally cooked for dinners. The same menu. Mrs. Shishodiya was very particular. Which guest likes what, what should be... ...the meal combination and... Do one thing. If Mrs. Shishodiya had been there... ...then what would she have chosen for these guests... ...you choose that. As you please, ma'am! Nobody is there to receive us. - Now don't start this! Welcome, Mr. And Mrs. Rajput. How are you, Mahajan? - Very well. Thank you. It doesn't look like there has been a second marriage. So what? Marriage is done for yourself and not for others. There you are, Malini. Hello, Shekhar! Hello, Vishaka. Hi, how are you? How is Vikram? You know, he has... No matter how many times he marries, he will remain the same. Guests have come and he is not at home. Am I right, Malini? Well, who can escape from a policeman's eyes? He will be here soon. Till then we will go and sit in the lounge? Actually it's all right. We will manage. Thank you so much. We will manage. I had told you not to bring me here. A sister is not a guest in her brother's house, Shekhar. Mahajan, where is Vikram's wife? Introduce her. Sure. This way please. Jia! - Yes! Why are you standing here like a thief? They have come to meet you. Go and meet them. Yeah! Please! Thank you, Mahajan. What did you say was her name? Jia! Jia Rao! I have not heard of this name before. Excuse me, sir. I will arrange for some tea and biscuit. Please make yourself comfortable. Thank you. Now please don't form your opinion before meeting her. I have formed an opinion. Look at her attitude. It's been so long since we came. And she has still not come to meet us. Good evening, Mr. Rajput! Hi! - Hi! - Vishaka! So you are Jia! - It's a pleasure meeting you! Same here! I hope you people are comfortable here. Its okay! Please have a seat! - Yes! I am so sorry to keep you waiting. Good evening, ma'am! - Good evening! Good evening, sir! Your tea! You're not as Vikram had described you to be. What had you expected? Just that you won't be so young in age. But Jia, you are really nice the way you are. You are so sweet. Are you happy, Jia? - A lot. With Vikram too? Yes. Actually everything happened so suddenly! That... I had never thought that in a moment... ...life could change so drastically. Just keep one thing in mind. If you have a cousin, then don't invite him to Gajner. Please! You know what? I will leave you both alone. My talks are not as bad as she thinks. After marriage I understood that policemen talk less... ...and they accuse more. Actually Jia, Shekhar is very possessive about Anamika. He considered her as his younger sister. The way Malini can't hear a word against Vikram... ...the same is with Shekhar. I understand. But when I came to know that Vikram has got married again... ...you can't guess how happy I was. I get a feeling that you both will be really happy with each other. Thanks. Sweetheart, your brother is here! If he saw me here alone, then he won't even... ...be able to bring a formal smile on his face. I thought we were invited here for dinner. That's what are we doing. Mourning. Usually people are so silent in someone's mourning. Some people here don't know how to talk. That's why no topic is being discussed. Why are you so conscious regarding Jia? How will she learn if we don't talk? Vikram, why don't you bring Jia home someday? Don't wait for an invitation. Life is not so long to keep waiting for invitations. Do you know how to play polo, Jia? Polo! No, but... - Then how will you spend time in Gajner? I will, I mean... - I understand. You must be spending a lot of time... ...because you don't have anything to do. Gajner's staff has trained Anamika so well... ...as if she is a automatic machine. You don't even need to press the button. Jia is a very good artist. Maybe you can start painting again. That's nice. Let's see, how good a painter you are. If you want to paint a symbolic painting of Gajner... ...then what would you draw? Symbolic. Front elevation of the palace... with a turban on top. I don't think so. A palace amidst the dessert. Try again. Gajner's reflection in the lake. You still haven't understood Gajner completely. If you want to draw Gajner in one symbol... ...then that symbol is Anamika. That was really mean Shekar. What did I say? You very well know what you said and what you have done! Please go and bring him back. One drink for me too. You didn't hear or you aren't interested in talking. I am not interested in anything that brings... ...that tragedy called Anamika back in my present. Why are you accusing me for it? You think about Anamika everyday yourself. Cheers. What I do with Anamika's memories and what not... ...that's my lookout. But if you talk about Anamika in front of that poor Jia... Jia! She will always be a deprived soul. Forget me, everything in Gajner... ...marks Anamika's presence. Whether you see her or not. Anamika is present in Gajner. You are a police officer, so be that. Don't try to be a judge and pass judgement. Anamika is dead. And now my wife's name is Jia. You are my sister's husband, that's why I tolerated it. But just today. You are my wife's brother, that's why I kept quiet then... ...and now too. But don't be under any delusion that... ...I don't know the truth behind Anamika's death. Thanks for the drink. Sometimes Vikram does get angry. But then, life hasn't been fair to him. And you know. Everything that happened between him and Anamika that... What had happened? Can we leave? Oh! God he's getting impatient. If you want to make your marriage successful... ...then don't wander into knowing what happened. What you don't know, is good for you. Take care, good night. Will you come now? Sorry for all this. - It's alright. Sorry. Jia! Jia! Sorry. Sorry, I am late. No more sorry. Shall we go somewhere far away from this sorry? Seems like it might rain. Narayan! A raincoat for the madam. Where are we going? Coming closer to each other. I know I am a difficult husband. But I will try to be easy. Do you know riding? - Yes, of course. That's good. Then today I will show you Gajner. Come here! Come here! Isn't she a beauty! Just remember one thing. Don't go that way. You got to control her and ride her well. Why not go that way? - Because I said so, okay. Come, come, come. Come on, beauty. Jia! Jia! Jia! Jia, don't go that way! Jia! She's there. She's somewhere around. I will find her! I will! Then there will be a storm again! And once again she will be back in Gajner with a bang! You said you knew horse-riding. Do you know how dangerous it is? I am sorry, Vikram. But how long will I say that I don't know this... ...I don't know that. I couldn't even be a good escort. I don't want to lose you, Vikram. I want to be your life. Please be a bit patient with me. It's my fault, Jia. We shouldn't have come to Gajner after marriage. This place can't see me happy. I am sorry. Forgive me. I hope you aren't angry with me. Come on, let's go. Stop crying. Stop crying. Otherwise the people of Gajner will think that... ...something is... you know what I mean. Come on, let's go. Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning, Mr. Mahajan. Mr. Mahajan, do you have matches? Yes. But I am sorry, I don't have cigarette. After Mrs. Shishodiya's demise no one smokes here. No, even I don't smoke but it's a bit cold today... ...so I thought I would light up the fireplace. - Sure. Thanks. Give me some work, too. Trust me, I know these things very well. There is such a lot of difference between you... ...and Mrs. Shishodiya. Like? No, no, I was just saying it. Even I know a bit. The biggest difference is that she was very beautiful. Isn't it? Everything about her was beautiful. Her dress, her hairstyle, appearance. Everything was a piece of art. But... But? A person can marry the most beautiful person in the world. But it is not easy to maintain relationships. What has happened to you? What's with the new hairstyle? Earlier it was just hair, there wasn't any style. What was the need to do all this? You like all this, isn't it? If I liked all this, then why would I have liked you? My Jia is lost somewhere in all this. I am extremely sorry, sir. If the matter wouldn't have been serious... ...then I would have never disturbed you. Ms. Malini is firing Mahesh and Hanumant from their jobs. They have been working with us for the past 10 years. What happened? There was an expensive vase in the library of Mrs. Shishodiya. And it's missing, that's why she... Ask Malini to talk to me. Right away, sir. Jia, now you should handle these matters. If that vase has been misplaced or... It's not been misplaced. And nor has anyone stolen it. Then? It's right there, in the drawer. But broken. I am sorry Vikram, actually I broke the vase... ...and I was scared so I hid it there. Who were you scared of? For God's sake. Jia, all of this belongs to you. Whether you break it or set it on fire. The only person who should mind is me. Stop behaving like a caretaker. You are prince Vikram Aditya Singh Shishodiya's wife. So start behaving like my wife. I can never be like that Mrs. Shishodiya. Which Mrs. Shishodiya? Like the Mrs. Shishodiya Gajner was used to. Whoever comes to meet me, they just come... ...to compare me with Anamika. Am I beautiful like Anamika? Am I a social figure or not. Do I have a class or not. What kind of clothes do I wear? That's all what people say. Is she as good as her? Maybe that's why you married me. Because I am a simple inexperienced middle-class girl. And no one can gossip about me. Like the way everyone would talk about Anamika. What gossip? What have you heard about Anamika? No, that... I meant to say that... What was the need to indulge yourself in all that? After coming to Gajner you... you are not the same Jia. Just look at you, what you have become. It's not going to work out. We can never be happy. Sorry. If you think we cannot stay happy together... ...then I will go back. But I can't see a reason why we can't be happy. We are happy with this marriage. I am happy! You are happy! Believe me, we both are very happy. Fine! I agree if you say so. We are happy. What did you tell Jia about Anamika? Take a seat, I will get tea for you. First answer my question! I didn't tell Jia anything about Anamika! Shekar hasn't discussed about Anamika, too. Then who? You Vikram. You don't want to leave Anamika yourself. Why did you get married? So that you can forget Anamika. But atleast try doing that. Or is it that you like being sad thinking about Anamika. I am giving Gajner a last chance. If I am not happy, then I will sell everything... ...and go far away from here. Vikram! Vikram are you going somewhere? - Mumbai! Then I too... - I don't need an escort. But... - Please Jia, I have forced you for the marriage. And now it's important that we stay apart for 2-3 days and think. Why do I get angry like this? And why do I get angry on you like this? You will get a break, too. Take care! Look Vikram, stay angry with me but be with me. Scold me, but be with me. Don't talk to me but be with me, Vikram. Vikram, I don't have anyone else in Gajner... ...except for you. - Jia, please. Vikram. - Try to understand, please. Babulal. - Vikram. Come on. Love can drown a person. Love can drown a person. Love. Love. The heart desires love. Life is useless without beloved. These moments of eagerness are so sweet. Moments of eagerness. Love. Love. The heart desires... Iove. There is silence reflecting on your lips. I never saw such an attitude of yours. As you raised your eyes and looked at me. I was floored. I was floored. Simplicity. Simplicity. The heart desires simplicity. Mr. Mahajan, is there someone in the west wing. No! No one goes there. Are you sure? Excuse me madam, it's restricted to go there. Ma'am! Ms. Jia, what are you doing here? I was a bit confused about the way. Actually I was looking for my room. You have come in the opposite direction. This is the west wing. By the way, I always knew that the west wing... ...always fascinated you. You wanted to see it. It is not like that. - It's absolutely natural. You should have told me... ...I would have made all the arrangements. Actually we are fortunate that Mr. Vikram Aditya is not here. But, now that you have come here... ...then you can fulfil your desire. Come, let me show you. This was Anamika's dressing area. She would adorn herself here. And this is Anamika's wardrobe. If we display her clothes, then trust me... ...this can beat any fashion boutique in the country. A flirt had once told Anamika in the party... ...that clothes are not as soft as they become... ...when you wear them. That flirt was right. Touch this. Can a cloth be so soft and cosy? Feel it. Go on feel it. Tell me, how does it feel? And this! Vikram Aditya and Anamika's bed. In a drunken state Mr. Vikram Aditya once told me... ...that he knows a woman whose desires increase... ...with every passing night. Except for me, no one else knew... ...that he was talking about Anamika. Why don't you do one thing? Until Mr. Vikram doesn't return... ...why don't you stay here. Feel those days, that happiness. Anamika. She is asleep on this bed. Wear her clothes. Sit there and adorn yourself. I promise you, I won't tell anyone. 'Mrs. Shishodiya's norms are followed here.' 'Even after her death, everything here... ...runs as per her orders.' I've not permitted you to come here! Now please leave! That's not fair, Malini! You are telling your guest to leave. I know the difference between Gajner's guests and enemies. So you too mind my coming here? I mind everything which Vikram minds. Please leave, Sanjay. Before somebody sees us here. But I can see that somebody is surreptitiously watching us. So she is Vikram's new wife. Don't cross your limits, Sanjay. Without crossing limits, you can't meet beautiful things! Hi! I am Sanjay! Anamika's favourite cousin! Hi. Jia Rao. Right? - Yes. You must have heard about me. Sorry. I don't know you. Nobody praises me in Gajner. Only Anamika used to talk about me. If Vikram Aditya returned then it will be really bad for us! Fine, Jia. I will leave. And we will meet soon. I am afraid that you have recently got married. And Vikram left you alone. I too am alone. See you around, Jia. Bye. Please do me a favour, Jia. When Vikram returns, please don't... ...tell him that Sanjay had come here. He will kill Sanjay. He is not so bad that he will kill somebody. He is not bad. His anger is bad. And that anger can kill anybody. Yes. Malini, did he say when will he return? He should be back by this evening. It's raining so heavily. Yes, it has never rained so heavily before. In fact it doesn't rain at this time of the year. It's not a good sign. Not a good sign? Meaning? Look, it's so dark at daytime. You stay in your room. If you need anything, then call me. Okay. Hello! Hello, Vikram. Jia, listen. Hi. Is it raining there? Yes, it's been raining for the past 3 hours. Its 6 o'clock. And it feels like it's midnight. You are returning today, aren't you, Vikram? I can't say. The flight is not departing. I don't know what's happening. Meaning you are not returning today too! Hello! Vikram! Vikram! I feel very strange here, Vikram! If possible then please return by tonight! Hello! Jia! Hello, Jia! Hello! Hello! Malini! Malini! Malini! Malini! What happened? - I saw her! I saw here in the courtyard! - Whom? Anamika! Believe me, Malini! I am speaking the truth! I know that you are speaking the truth. But not you... she has seen you. You shouldn't have gone to the west wing. It's not good. Maybe she is not happy with Vikram Aditya's second marriage. But Anamika died in an accident. There are certain deaths in which a person dies... ...but still lives on. What kind of death? Just relax. Don't think about this. Tonight you stay with me. Come. You will be safe here. Let's go. Rana! Did you know Anamika? I am her guide. I have given her a tour of this desert. She too would bring breakfast for me everyday... for sure. What happened to her? How did she die? No! She didn't die! Nothing has happened to her! She is alive! She has only gone somewhere. Where? Where did she go? She had a fight with sir. Sir shouldn't have done that. Sir almost killed her. I am scared of Ioneliness. Come and embrace me. Now my heart is afraid of things. Don't go away from my sight. Come and sing a love song of loyalty. You are love. Solace. Solace. My heart desires solace. So? You learnt horse riding. What else can I do here alone? Even I was alone there. You are alone here, too. And you left me so that you could decide... ...what to do with our relationship. I have decided. I have decided, Jia. I want to come closer to you. 'Sir almost killed her.' I understand I have been really unfair to you. Forgive me. I just want us to be happy. Me too, sweetheart. Me too. I missed this beautiful hand. I missed this beautiful forehead. I missed this lovely cheek. This cheek too. I missed this lovely neck of yours. I saw her. Who? Anamika. The more I try to forget her... ...the more you bring her between us. You are obsessed with her. Maybe because I don't know much about Anamika. And whenever I try to find out then... ...instead of telling me, people hide things. What do you want to know about her? - The truth. If I had known the truth... then I would have... ...told you without you asking me. Anamika's truth died with her. I am sorry, Vikram. I promise I won't talk about things which I shouldn't talk. But I will liberate you, myself and... ...Gajner from those memories. And I have an idea. Everybody talks about the parties which were given in Gajner. The celebration, the commotion. Let's have those parties again, Vikram. Vikram! You didn't answer me! So you want to begin the same things in Gajner. Again those things will happen... ...which used to happen in those parties. To liberate us from those memories... ...you are reviving those memories. So you too want to start those parties in Gajner. I didn't say that. These things were discussed in my absence. It feels as if Anamika has returned as Jia. Darkness runs away from light. You will be happy only when Gajner will be happy. That liveliness was for somebody else. What did I get in those parties? You know that! The problem is your point of view. Had I been in your place... ...I would have accepted Jia's suggestion. I think this will look very pretty. Malini! This wouldn't have been possible without you. My pleasure. I used to dress up Mrs. Shishodiya for these parties. Today Vikram won't be able to take his eyes off you. Excuse me. Malini, the mask's sample. And here is you mask. Mask! This is the norm of this masquerade party. All the guests are hidden behind masks. And you have to find your lover... ...meaning your husband and then dance with him. It's said that the one whose love is true... ...they find their love hidden behind the mask. I told you. You will come to me. How dare you! Hey! What's the big deal? Let go of my hand! Come on, we were just dancing! Don't touch me! I just wanted to celebrate! Celebrate my foot! What are you doing here? Get out of here! Vikram! Vikram! Vikram, stop it! How dare you touch her! - Vikram! - Vikram! She was Anamika! - Vikram! Today you met Jia! - Stop it! I said stop it! Vikram! - Let go! Stop it! - Let go of me! Stop it! You are disgusting! Come on! We are leaving! Let's go! Come on! - Come! Come on, Vishaka! You will be sorry for this, Vikram! Don't stop me! Don't surrender! Don't stop me! Don't surrender! Don't stop me! Don't surrender! Don't stop me! Don't surrender! You dwell in my eyes. You dwell in my heart. You dwell in my dreams. My heart thinks. My heart wants. My heart asks for... Company. My heart wants... Company. My heart asks for... Company. Your company. Company. Your company. Don't stop me! Don't surrender! Don't stop me! Don't surrender! The ambience is crazy. The moment too is lovely. The season is pleasant. Why do you torment me? There is a storm in my heart. My desires are aroused. I crave for you. Why do you torment me? There is craving. There is merriment too. This separation is difficult. Why do you torment me? You dwell in my eyes. You dwell in my feelings. You dwell in my heart. My heart thinks. My heart wants. My heart asks for. Company. My heart wants. Company. My heart asks for. Company. Your company. Company. Your company. Yes! You are here in the west wing. Now I will be seen here, Malini. From today, this will be my bedroom. Did you ask Vikram Aditya? Vikram says that as far as Gajner's affairs are concerned... ...I don't have to ask anything from anybody. I am giving you a task, Malini. It should be done by tomorrow. What? Anamika's personal belongings... ...especially on which A is embossed... ...shift it to the out house. I don't want to see those things in Gajner. You mean to say all of Mrs. Shishodiya's things... I am Mrs. Shishodiya, Malini. Anamika will be called Anamika. In Gajner, I am Mrs. Shishodiya. Yes... Mrs. Shishodiya. You know, I always used to find... ...Rajasthan a very secluded place. But now I find it very romantic. This all the heart's doing, Jia. Is the wind blowing too hard or is this too the heart's doing? You are right. I think a storm is approaching. Jia! Jia, get out! Quick! Quick! Down! Just get down! I told you! A storm will arrive! And it will bring many things along! Vikram, sir has called you for inquiry. Come. What was the truth of... ...Anamika and your relationship? You know that I know. There was so much rancour for Anamika in your heart. You know that I know. Anamika's death was not an accident. You know that I know. Only one man had the motive for this murder. Mr. Vikram Singh Shishodiya. Will you confess killing Anamika? Or shall I make you do it? I know my hatred... killed Anamika. But why is this being called murder? Post-mortem report. A heavy blow on the head. Here. In the middle. It happens when the head is hit with a heavy weapon. Case of a broken skull. Shekhar! You have arrested Vikram! You think he has killed Anamika? If you want to question your husband... ...then sit at home and wait for his return. Here only I ask questions. Excuse me. But... Go from here Jia. Tell me where. I thought I have started to understand you. Whatever you know about me, I am all that. What you don't know, that's Anamika. Mumbai's most interesting and fascinating celebrity... ...Anamika Shroff. She came to Gajner on my invitation. And stayed back forever. The society would always gossip... ...that who would Anamika Shroff marry. They got their answer. We first expressed our love in the dessert. And Anamika made her first promise in that dessert, too. I will love you a bit less, but be loyal to you more. But she turned out to be disloyal. Her friends soon started invading Gajner. A new party in every three months. She turned Gajner into a night club. In the beginning even I would enjoy it. But, behind all those activities... ...rumours started building up. Anamika would be paired with many different people. Especially with that Sanjay... ...who was supposed to be his cousin. Malini and I would helplessly listen to all these news. Then one day, after the party. I couldn't tolerate it anymore. Look Vikram, you are misunderstanding. There is nothing between Sanjay and me. I can see what the relation is, and also hear it. You understand? Fine, then I will prove it. And then you will feel ashamed. I felt ashamed. Not of the accusation, but for the relation... ...between Anamika and me. Where is Anamika? I asked where is Anamika? Actually, she has gone to Karni palace to talk to Sanjay. Hello! - Give the phone to Anamika. Phone for you. She had come again, to explain everything. That was our last meeting. Please spare me and Gajner! We don't want you anymore. And before you turn this place into a whorehouse, leave! And get the hell out of my life. Mrs. Shishodiya! Mrs. Shishodiya! Please stop. There is a storm brewing up! And a dessert storm is very bad! Please stop! Mr. Vikram it's dangerous, please stop her. Let her die, I don't care. The storm was getting intense. A little while later Malini called and said that... ...Anamika's jeep was found in the dessert upside down But she was missing. The police searched for her a lot... ...but she couldn't be found. She went missing in the dessert in that sandstorm. I want all of Vikram's conversation on record. Every word. - Yes. I'll just be back. - Yes. I am coming. But the police say that you murdered Anamika. Do you believe me or not? I want to believe you, Vikram. Believe me. I want to believe every word you said. Hello ma'am, do you feel that he has murdered Anamika? Ma'am, please tell us. Ma'am! Ma'am! It's alright Mrs. Shidhodiya, it's alright. It's alright. Just relax. Go home, I will handle this. Go home. Okay. Go home, go. Ma'am. Excuse me! Excuse me! Don't worry, the decision will be given in your favour. I am the witness. The day Anamika disappeared you were in Gajner. I had gone after her, to stop her. And then I called you from that same phone. Hello Mr. Vikram. The car is stuck up ahead. There is no trace of Anamika. I can't see here anywhere. What can the law do? My testimony will save you. I know that you are innocent. I am only worried about Jia. She is so innocent that she thinks all this is true. I am afraid that she might do something. I think I need to be with her. You take care. Anamika! Anamika! Anamika! So you think Malini's testimony will save you. You were listening to our conversation. The police have to do their duty. By the way, don't be too dependant on Malini's testimony... ...because the court won't accept it. Why? Because I will decide which testimony reaches the court! Was there anyone else in your life before Anamika? No. After Jia? No. What are you doing? The line of love is situated here. And there are three lines in your hand. What do you mean to say? Come with me. Come. I still love Mr. Vikram. I love him more than anybody could've ever loved him. Anamika. Don't you dare take that name here? I am Mrs. Shishodiya. I don't believe this. You never believed me. You always thought I hated you. But that's not true. It's just the way I am. You are educated and still believe in ghosts. You wanted to know the truth, isn't it? Gajner's biggest truth is that Malini loves Vikram. I have lived all my life for Vikram. Anamika and your love can't even be compared to my love. Anamika didn't have any affair. For her Sanjay was just a cousin. But I allured Sanjay and proved her characterless. Yes, Vikram. You are in Sanjay's room. Or is this my misunderstanding, too. And that day, the storm rose so that justice can be done... ...with my love. Mr. Vikram! Mr. Vikram! The car is stuck up ahead. There is no trace of Anamika. I can't see her anywhere. 'Anamika lost to my love and died.' 'I thought now Vikram will understand my love.' If that's so, then why didn't you ever tell Vikram... ...that you loved him. - Why, couldn't he see it? He should have felt it. But now he will. Because tonight you will die too. People will think that, Jia also believed... ...that Vikram has murdered Anamika. And she committed suicide. So goodbye Jia. From today, I will be Mrs. Shishodiya. Malini, please don't do it! Malini! Malini, stop this madness Malini! Help! Malini! Malini! What's that? O my God, Gajner! Shekar Rajput here. Send the fire brigade at the Gajner palace. Immediately! Jia! Jia! Jia! Are you okay? You okay? Okay Jia! Mr. Vikram, she did what I was afraid off. Jia tried to set the west wing on fire and commit suicide. Malini, I know you have started this fire. I even know that you have killed Anamika. I know everything, Malini. What you don't know is that how much I love you. You could never see my love, Vikram. Malini! Get out of there. Malini, get out from there. If you can save me, then save me. Malini just stop this stupidity and get out of there. Get out of there. Malini! Malini! Malini! Malini! Vikram, take care of Jia. I will take care of this. From there, quickly! Come on! Love! Love! Love! Love! Love! Love! Love! Everyone needs it. Love! Love! Love! Love! Love! Love! Love! Everyone needs it. Immersed in my eyes. Your beautiful face has immersed in my eyes. My beloved, I find you very attractive. My beloved, I find you very attractive. How do I express to you my sweetheart? I have lost my heart to you. I have lost my heart to you. You are my insanity. I fallen in love with you, I have! Love cannot be controlled by anyone. No one can bind the hearts. No matter what one tries to oppose. No matter what one tries to oppose. I have lost my heart to you. Love cannot be controlled by anyone. No one can bind the hearts. Love cannot be controlled by anyone. No one can bind the hearts.
