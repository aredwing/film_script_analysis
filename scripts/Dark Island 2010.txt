You were in the military, do they? Where did you serve? She talking only when necessary. The perfect girl, is not it? - And you, Miss Miller, what about you? - The doctor Miller. It is our healer. Recently, we lost contact with our patrol. Base they were here, Meyer on the island... ...35 miles to the west. This island has become a primary testiralite Altracorpa. What is tested? Their camp is located here communications are disrupted. The whole area the no-fly zone... ...And radio links are blurred, in the best case. The island is covered with a thick layer lia... ...But there's almost no animals. Our mission is search and rescue. ProeIjati island and find those missing. If that fails, the task is to pick up any info... ...To explain what happened. - Alene, you are responsible for it. - Expires? It's a little dark sides, you agree? I wish we go survive.

Primeuje up. Aspirin. I get headaches often. You want some? About two miles from the landing places are. Hey, Ray. Where is the concierge? - Not so fast, trekovac. Want to help us out with her own business? Here we make camp. Alene, you and Dr Miller set their areas of operation. Rachel and I'll go first Mielovog to camp. We remain in communication. Here you go... When you should be. What is it? Why do you expect tribal drums now? - Do not touch! - It looks fresh. - 2, maybe 3 days old. - Is it oil? Better question is... Who is this done? These are the scarecrows. And already something of intimidation. This is a warning. - What would the "no animals"? - The birds are coming through the wind. Looks like organic decay, but I have never seen anything like this. When you put things can do a few tests. - It's not a bird, Ray. - Alena, stay here. Help Dr Miller on everything. - So you go back? - Yes, before it gets dark. Your boss has my number. Well, I guess I'll see you when I see you. Yes... I hope you'll find your team. Hey, can you help me with this? No it, Ray. Stay here! Wait! Do not leave me here itself! Stop! Kane! That's our man. MIEE... - It's me, Raymond. - You! I know you! What's wrong with him? MIEE... just calm down. We have come to the rescue... - We must go! There it is! - Do not move. Here is... Everywhere! We have to leave the island. MIEE, what is it there? What happened here? I killed a lot of birds. But there were not enough. It's okay. With us. - We need to go to this island. - It's OK MIEE, we'll go. But first we must find out what happened. It is a doctor, can you help. You're not listening. Leads me to this island, now! Vile! - Blank said. - I have not finished. That's it. Let's go back to the boat. We must take him to hospital. All we want you to know as soon as I calm down. But now, all you have to take from this island. You are all my responsibility. We have not yet found his partner Walsh. Dead. He's dead. All dead. Well... go! Sophie... You're not a captain on the island. This is my mission. We remain where we are. You want maybe to vote? Maybe she's right, Ray. I can take care of MIEE and here. Trying to understand... Well... Sophie... Alene Take MIEE back to camp. Rachel and I'll continue searching. Villas, I'd like to stay. This is your team, obviously that is not mine. I'll be on board until you need them. You'll all die! - There could prei trees. - Line ravens... You must be joking! Where is your ship ovece? Damn, what we do now? We must find him! Maybe... maybe in the bay. We could swim to it. We will not swim anywhere. We would not have withstood the twenty minutes in the icy waters. Well sir! What is the hell was that thing? What they did on this island, and what we actually do here? Well. Be honest, we stuck here? Can we use your satellite phone to send a call for help? Yes, now razmiija reasonable. - Let it switched on. - If anyone catches a signal. The no-fly zone are! No one listens to the conversation has over the radio here. In Mievom camp There transmit. Is directly linked to Altracorpom. I'm not right back there. Falls. - Here we are safe. - We can go in the morning. - Zavriemo search... - Your search is over! You saw what it did your man. I am sure that neither his partner did not have much more luck. There are a lot of important information that we have to pick up. Especially now. So what do you want to do? To sit and we wait The boat fishing? We have a schedule of 48 hrs. No one would not suspect anything, at least 36 hrs. See... if we can turn on the transmit... ...Spasilaki team will come here for about 20 minutes. When we look at the situation, it seems to me that we do not have much choice. Still nothing. Do not. Says nothing. Just sitting there. It may not be manifested kroy inorganic matter. Sand. Sand is a dead zone. Can not prei beach. Or water. Therefore, it is like to Miel leave the island. Captured here. Just like me. Pretty good, right? It seems quite complicated for doctor. Well... I knew exactly what to pack so I packed everything. Yes, women usually make it. So... Clarify me. Do you know what are they doing here? Not quite. Some kind of biological research. Ray is worried that the team neime infected, so... Rachel understand... It is like a razor. But you, why did you bring? Jingo! Just have nice properties. Yes, that's what I, at least you get what you see. Maybe you do not like, but at least is honest. But all of this... And Ray... I'm not sure. Add to paranoid traits. - At least a traitor is not entered in the list. I? You're wanted to leave us all here! - "Call me when you need it"; - I was there when I needed you, did I? Forget it, ma'am... Doctor. I have not signed up for this shit. I also dream about the future disappears this family. Listen Villas, you have to pull together. This is a profession we have chosen. You were his superiors. It was your responsibility. This is not the first time that I lost a man. And they will not be the last. It seems that things gledas's different since you got these lines on the shoulder. - Published by're Briggs. - Who brought everyone else! You were not allowed to bring us into this situation! We did not have any information, no support... Watch what you are saying, soldier! It seems to me that you're happy because you progressed on the list. Well congratulations... Sergeant. No matter is that one of your people returns home in the ark. It could be worse. I could be your mother's front door. You can thank me on it. Do not enter. Find his own transportation. Reje! What happened? - It was all around him. - Get away. Ray, what was it? I'm really sorry. We are not even supposed to come here. There was no possibility to know what's in the woods. This is not true. Raymond! What is it, reje? What is going on here? All this is a setup. Rachel and I work for Altracorp. At least not anymore. So what do we do it here reje? I worked in biological research in Altracorpu, renewable energies. I am a scientist. Funding we abolished when they find deeper pockets. They took my work... ...And use it for things that I did not want uestvovati. Biochemical weapons is much better of the virus. And is it there? Some kind of biochemical weapons? I do not know what it is! I'm not sure even that Altracorp know. Something went wrong with their tests there. Miel gave me some information recent months. I knew something was wrong. I had no idea... - And we're dragged into it! - I had to get back at MIEE. You saw why! See, whatever it is there... That thing... ...Nesreni the case. Consequence of the enterprise in bad faith. And now you know. I'm sorry. And what can we do? Beach is not safe and do not have no way to defend ourselves. We need information Mieve how would we know we are against What for... ...First we need weapons. If the organic... ...In any way... ...Then he will not appreciate this. Not at all. Come on! Accelerate it! - Do you work? - I do not know. No antenna. We do not need. Povezaemo it with Vilovo satellite phone. We have it. Rachel, you and Will you return to the beach. Run it engine. Prepare it. - I want to stay with the radio. - I need you for the PC. Stay here. I found it! - Do what you need. - I do. - What is it? - Nothing. Continue to walk. Let's see if that works. Goal! - Find test 48th - I know, I know... If you watch this video... ...Test 48, did not go according to plan. Here, Vanguard 1, Do not come here. I repeat: Do not come! Miel. I suppose you this message never arrived. Can we go now? I have to stop. We must not stop. We have to move! Come on! I'll overtake you. L'll these ice from the refrigerator. 'll Be right back. Rachel! What's happening? Well, if you do that? It would be good to have the original... Forget the torch, let's go! Where are they? Where the hell! Rachel! Where is she? Where is it? Where the hell? Something happened to her... - What happened? - Is infected! Let me go! Hey man, There was nothing I could do. Reje is infected. Some sort of weapon. Dispersed. In order... Now we can defend ourselves. Poeu Mielovim to work on files. I'll see what I can piece down. There it is. Part of the miracle... Somewhere. Iskoristie her to come here. We must be vigilant. Do you think it's gonna be okay? I was guilty of this. Have you all taken? Should be sufficient to think to work for Altracop. Were there any problems with the provision? Nothing that I could not fix it. What files? Did you take them? Miel had done his part. You have a lot of reading ahead. Go take a shower. This is... This is an SOS. Please check and reply. Reception. Wait. This is a call for help. Called at intervals. Just keep an open channel to hear if someone replies. Be there and listen. This is an SOS. Please reply. Please. Have you solved the mystery? Seems to have worked on Altracorp new kind of biological weapons. On a live weapon. And this one that destroys all other living creature. So the goal and the infection spreads Cells like a virus. The infection is supposed to be reserved isotope which... ...Is similar to that found in rasprivau. Good soldiers can be move freely... ...Bad soldiers, become black and sticky. - It is obvious that something went wrong. - Very. Disease has not only infected Cells, completely took over. It'll be a living is like hives in which All Cells are working together... ...This disease is the same principle. But just as it fulfills its purpose.. ...Which is it? To infect and destroy? That is expanding continuously; That's about it to. - What kind of doctor are you? I am a toxicologist. Specialist I for reverse engineering. It is pretty specific to the field of for a rescue mission. And you are in this from the beginning, right? See, I did not know what happened here. We have not told you about your safety, We know you'll stay with us. And when I saw how you reacted Rejevu the story last night... ...I just did not want to just think about me. - And Allen? - We knew the same as Ray. To test something Altracorp horrible here. Something that must be stopped. These are experiments that are not allowed to continue. Someone has to take on that responsibility. See how much it cost. I tried to protest. To do something. But instead I... released. They did so in order take my research. ...To do this. I'm sorry I dragged you into this Villa. But do not blame her. I am the job. And God knows that I paid a high price... ...But I have to finish this. Now more than ever. I must not let this thing beat. You know, Captain Ahab said the same thing. You know how to take care of yourself, It is pretty and you're good at it, Villas... ...But as you are in a broader perspective? Did you used to be sacrificed because of little something for what you knew was right? This is called purpose. Something you believe. Something to fight, regardless of price... ...Because you know that this is the right thing to be done. I believe that we're doing the right thing. Do you believe that you did the right thing by telling me this information? Yes, sir. - But the mission was successful, right? - Not for my men, sir. Your people? You think people sergeant Cutter. Its mission, his decision. Whatever the motives that had, In your miIjenju... ...Will remain just that. Your miIjenje. Success is measured in this world the two things. Through perseverance and dedication. Are you devoted razogu, rows? Do you think that doing the right thing? There. We found the reason. Sergeant Kater has released its people by you sent them... That's enough! Faces I have a dilemma soldier. Your word against your word superior officers. Yes, Sergeant Kater was already here... He explained his work... ...And your reckless disregard his orders! I will not tolerate disloyalty! Neither the army, nor our purpose. As of this moment is dismissed, the soldiers. The decision is effective immediately. Do not say anything because What for are you going to repent, my son... I want to be the Next helicopter here! Do you understand me? You go... civilian. What about crows? With coffee? Completely collapsed. Dead. In order to reverse the process I need a live specimen. I doubt that this thing will want to cooperate. Maybe a little something to testiralitu we could use. We must try something. Rachel is still there. It is not Rachel. Now a part of it. Infected. As Miel. But not dead. Exactly! If infected, and if the live... ...I might have with the help of her blood could create a serum. It could work. Miel said all the chemical elements... ...And I could use the pollen from rasprivaa one that you have found. What do you need from me, reje? Let us go and we find Rachel. There is somewhere. Watching us. I know. Keep walking. That's it. I made a similar device based on their designs. This is an underground station. Injects a toxin into the center of the island. Should we reverse the process if we use the serum. Then keep scrolling. There you go. There is no one around to we share with them. Do you see anything? Still nothing Rachel! Ray will not come. I have it! Holds it firmly! Sorry about that. Postaviemo machine drain. Right back up before dawn. Call us through this if you manage to make a serum. I did it! Functions. - You serious? - I think. I used her natural antibodies doskoim to infect... ...Using a similar chemical mixture that of a gun... Molecular... irrelevant. It was successful in small doses. We need a bigger sample. Throw it on the enemy and hope that will not expand. Does not sound like a smart idea brilliant minds. We plan a way of control. A similar spray from that weapon. Soldiers would take a pill, a bookmark... ...Which would then developed resistance the infection. - How is it changed? - Everything has changed for the worse. Ready. Hurry! I know... I try! Rachel? O God! What the hell? What happened? - This thing... - How do you feel? Are you okay? I do not know. Why am I tied? - I do not believe it! - Works! It's quick, but you returned to normal. You need water. Alene, she does it. - I need to call Ray. - It is? Thank goodness. - I'm sure you this is surprising. - What are you doing? And now we are alone. I have to admit Doctor, impressed I. I did not think you'll succeed. And now... Give me the rest... We both know that this is not the whole sample. You think I'm stupid? Let's... the tent. To take it all. Take... Or do you want me to ask? I have other plans, but... This can be useful. - You're pushed boat. - I'm guilty of this. I could not allow anyone to go here before I finish. I even saved the life of Rey, I really needed it to complete its mission. Why? I have to finish their testing. Latest invention, the control group. - Keep them at bay - You were not in danger. No. I was just a good actor. Now you just need one more thing to do. Should I put my sample in Rejevu gadget. He came to my turn to infect. Sorry for this doctor. Nothing personally, All this is just a job. Is that what you think it is? Potpredsednie, I know that your time is valuable... ...Because I'll be brief. Doctor Raymond Hua I was just contacted in connection with one mission.. Ray is planning a trip to the island Meyer. Wants to shake up things a bit. This is not good for you sir potpredsednie Vesler? I want to help, but require protection Altracorpa. No doubt you want the money. It would be very nice of you. May undermine its operation from the inside... ...And can provide you what you want. What I want to? Allen is a radio set in the dead zone. He now works. Someone will soon appear. In this case, we'll begin. Thank you. What for? No one has saved his life so far. - And how was it? - It was very nice! Here SES 1, we receive a call for help on this channel. - Here we are! - Hello! Here, Dr Sophie Miller. Can you hear me? - Loud and clear Dr Miller. Thank God! Signal are read your site Alfa 9th In the forbidden zone are. Prepare for evacuation. Arrive in 20 minutes. Reception. We have them. Wait! We do not have too much time To start the test. Are you kidding? Tell that to the guys when they come. They will not understand. We need to do now. But they come in 20 minutes Ray. Then do not waste time anymore. Ray, spasie us. His struggle to carry Altracorpa, to the media... ...Tell them what happened here. You do not have to take the chance your life... To take the chance? Look what I've been lost. Nothing will not to mean if you do not finish what I started! What we've begun. I can not afford to reje they have done. Stop! It's your fault... Do not leave Rachel... - Is The vial! - There is something much worse. Going to testiralite. But the soldiers come in 15 minutes! Sophie, wait back here. The team is coming very quickly. Go to Allen. Villas... ...I could use your help. Yes, it is always the case. Listen... Let's go. This way, we're going. You end launch and stop Allen. And you? I'm going to play around with the locals. Hey, Rorak! I'm here! Run! It is almost Alene! Not yet... It's over! Not until I tell you! You should know something about the persistence of Ray. But one should know when to quit. Back to work. Provide the beach! Faster, faster! Check the tent! Tent was empty. Contact in 12 hours. Go! I'm sorry Ray. 're Just late. What did you do? Something the release here. Something much stronger than what they thought... ...And now it's mine! You can not control it. Come with me. Come with me! I feel better. What's happening? I do not know. Come on. Where the serum? With Allen. Run! My move. We go from here? Alfa time, What's your status? Command, Alpha team leader here. Saved as we move back. Air support may take. Again, air support can go! Alfa understand, start with Clay. Air support is coming. The boat enters the! All you all right? Here they are! We still have not finished here. Where is Sophie? I told you. Good. Very well. Talk with her... Same as with you. Story? Does this so called? Tell me again why I can not let from here? Why I am here a prisoner? It is very pesimistian view. And you call me that? A detainee in the fight. Uestvovali you are in a very unusual event. We have to take precautions. I told you everything. I am not infected. Does not work like that! Look at us as enemies. I do not blame you for that. If I were in your place, as I thought! Someone watching us? Yes, it is always the case. In whatever you believe, And do you believe... ...We are not the enemy. Then why are my hands tied? And where is Sophie! I want to see it. The victims in this life must always submitted, Mr. Kane. For the greater good. Do you ask me to join you? Are you kidding? I will not do it! Can you hear me there? I will not be part of this! I will not be part of this! You've been... So there are no side effects? None. Are you sure about this? There are no side effects. Mr. Kane has already infected 72 hours and shows no adverse effects. It is completely healthy. I did not ask on the subject of testing. I asked you about the infection. Test 49 was a complete success. Congratulations, doctor.
