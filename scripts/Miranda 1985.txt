People will think I'm a cheap whore, right? Go on, do it again. Would you let me play the man, Berto? I love you, Miranda. I love you. You are not the only one. The old man again, right? Sure, he loves me too. Look, pretty nice ring. Get rid of it, you hear? You're crazy? It's mine. - You are a... - Say it, go on. It gets me all excited. Slut! Whore! Bitch! Why don't we live together, Miranda? Do you think that if I were a man and you were someone I dig that I would want to live with you? And besides there's Gino. But you know very well your husband is lost. I don't think so. They only said he was missing. They might be right. Stop the car! Are you out of your mind? We don't want any trouble. I'm starving. Bring me a little wine and some cheese, Tony. So there you are. I was worried. Sit down, have a drink. Hey, is something wrong? I thought you'd sleep here together. I never brought anyone here for anything like that. Besides, I don't have to answer to anyone. Including you. Here's this weeks' money. What am I going to do about all the bills this month? I've got a pretty good idea. You? What do you mean? I know a guy who'd buy that ring. But I can't sell it. If I do ... then what do I tell the consul? I'd make sure that the guy gives you a copy of that one that looks just the same. Well... sell to him... but fast, eh? Before the consul notices it's gone. Is Leda in yet? No. All right. Make sure to clear all the tables and lock up. No one's gonna show up in this weather. Tony! What do you like most in a woman? Tell me. Generosity. In other words, I should take you to bed. Good idea. Stop right there! I only wanted to give you the money. Now you've turned chicken? Hypocrite. You should never mix sex and money. I think they go very well together. Not for me. I'm only an employee. And so what? Well, I'm waiting for my orders. Go on, very, very funny. Good night, boss. Pleasant dreams. Jack's been killed. It's terrible. I'm never gonna see him anymore. They never gave him a chance, they just shot him down. Near the river bank. Look, how about us taking a trip to Rimini, just you and me? You've got to forget about Jack and you will a lot sooner than you think. You'll feel guilty that you've forgotten, I know. But that's life, Leda. And you are the one who has to go on living. It makes no sense to suffer. I know, I don't want to suffer. But I can't stop crying I'm so unhappy I want to bawl. This may not console you but in everyone's life there are lots of broken lines and maybe a straight line, if you're lucky. I'm still stuck with broken lines. But still I go on looking for the guy who's right for me hoping he'll straighten me out. There, there. Why don't you smile, Leda? Look out there, even the sky's trying to smile. It's hardly snowing anymore. Maybe winter's finally over. I finished working at the Ferrara Fair at 2 AM It took all night to peddle here. Can't wait to hit the sack. I think it's about time you bought a motor scooter. First I'll buy a wife and then I'll buy a motor scooter. Come on, who'd wanna marry you? You're too black. Drink your coffee and go straight up to sleep. I'll put your bike away for you. Here comes the boss. I'm with the team working on the gas pipeline. I'm American. We'll be here for about 5 or 6 months. Got any rooms to rent? I got four, but two are already occupied. Let me have the two that aren't. Would you like to have a look at them? I'll take your word for it. Thank you, madam. Miranda. And you? Norman. Here, boss. The consul asked me to give you this. Ciao, Miranda. Well, thanks! THIS AFTERNOON AT THE USUAL PLACE There's something for you in my pocket. Your hand's like a man who's very old and still a baby too. I admire the way fish make love. They leave a stream of semen behind them in the current without even coupling with their mate. Anonymous, mute... Like your hand in me now. Why don't you go away with me? I've nearly completed my term of exile. They're bound to give me amnesty soon. I'm very old and rich, isn't that guarantee enough? Baby, it's your skin I like best, it's tired. I adore your white hairs. It's all like a second opportunity for you, darling. Now I could change that. Come inside me, Carlo. Tell me why you never do, please. I'm afraid you might get pregnant. It's ridiculous at my age, don't you think? Afraid for me or of being a father? You don't have to worry, darling. Is Tony aware that we come here? Of course. I always tell him who I'm with. I might have known, women are all the same. The necklace you gave me looks pretty, doesn't it? I'll buy a hundred for you. I'll give you anything you like, my family has money. In Naples, I have a palace just waiting for us. I lived there with my wife 'til she died. Anonymous, mute... The fish are better. - I've grown jealous, you know. - Of Berto? You seem to forget you told me you like the idea of us two making love. 'The Body can admit other partners the heart never' . What does that mean? It's my heart that cannot bear your having lovers. My balls don't care. I like it better when you talk French to me. It reminds me of the Sacred Heart nuns when I went to school. In other countries, everybody speaks a little bit of French, particularly the whores. Tony, more wine! Leda! Okay, okay! Is the meat ready? Hold on, I can't serve it raw. I'd call that "well-done". What was that, Tony? I said your dress looks very nice. You think so? - Oh, yes and how, it shows off all that nice flesh. - What does it show off? I meant that it looks nice and fresh and not hot and stuffy. I'll bet it turns you on. - A paradise of erotic beauty. - Now you're a poet too. Oh, all it takes is a bit of nerve and anybody can be a poet. Marvellous, how did I end up trusting him? I love meat and women! Especially fleshy women! Another one! What are you waiting for! This card wins. This card loses. This card wins. This card loses. This one's the winner, this one's the loser... Are you gonna screw me again? You never know. Luck's blind, as they say. This one wins and this one loses. This one loses, this one loses. This one loses... Which do you choose? Bravo. Now I play. Are you ready, Mr. Consul? This card wins, this one loses. This one loses, this one wins. This card wins, this card loses. Keep watching. Once again. Which is the winner? This one. I'm sorry, Mr. Consul, you lose. That's all right. Luck's fickle like a woman, which is why it likes young men. So if she's a woman, I imagine she'd like any old man who paid for her. These two friends of mine will take the other room. They're French, they're studying music in Parma. Juliette, Gabrielle. You don't mind do you, Miranda? Why don't you ask your friends to give us a song then? She can't sing... And do you sing? I sing and dance. Ciao, Italo. Enchanted, Miss Juliette. My name is Carlo, I worked in France. - Oh, in the mines? - No! As a diplomat. I'll leave him to you. Ok, don't worry. I'll see that they're well-taken care. Thanks, Miranda. Marvellous that you say my name so nicely. Is this a party or something? A dead man is paying for our drinks. - A dead man? - Iride. He left us 10.000 lire to celebrate after his funeral. Great. Let's celebrate then, ok? Cheers! What do you think? It looks like a battleship. Thank you. I might make the letters bigger. Bigger than they are now? Berto transports anything anywhere. Come on, come on, get in. - Where are we going? - I wanna show the depo. Who was that guy with the two girls? Norman? A technician with the gasline team. He's American, you know. He's a son of a bitch. Why is that? He had no right to call you Miranda. - But Americans always do that. - Italians don't! I wanted to show you the work they've done on the garage. Look. That's where our house will be, right there. Selling watches? That one's for you. Put it on. Oh, Berto. Darling. Just a minute. There's something I want you to see. Come on. Where did you get all this stuff? I got it all with 50% off from that furniture company I work for. And look what else I've got? I delivered truckloads of these to Bologna. I don't think they'll miss the case I stole for us. Cheers. Stop it, would you, that tickles. I want to marry you, Miranda. I want to marry you... Do you know that men with socks on really turn me off, especially when they're wearing boxer shorts? And besides didn't you tell me you love me because with me you had freedom? I must have a woman who will stand behind me. Well, look around! Where do you think I am? Pretty funny, except when I make love I do it front! You know I'm never going to marry you. You'll marry the old man, huh! Or maybe you fell in love with your American friend. How can I make love to someone who doesn't understand the woman he says he's in love with? - Women are all alike! - And you're useless! No! I'm sorry! You made me angry. You don't even know how to get angry! I like your arse Berto, that's all! Put it in the closet for all I care! No, Miranda don't go! Please, come back! The proprietor has had a breakdown! Go on, Gabrielle, give your seat to Miranda. Why does it have to be me? He'll take you back in the truck. Oh, shit! Goodbye, Gabrielle. Goodbye. See you later! Goodbye. Who the hell does she think she is! Bitch. There's hundreds like her and better. Right, and here's one. And all of them piss the same way. Beautiful... I want to amuse myself Let's go Baby com'on. Do you want a little? Sure. What's that? It's Turkish gum. Makes you high. I want some too. Here they are! I really like women who get wet right away. No, no, it's only sweat. Besides I have to pee. - Want me to leave? - Why are you ashamed? Is it true that where you're from they don't kiss girls here? Who taught you to drive me crazy like you do? I learn fast on my own. Com'on, kiss me. No, not here. You know where I mean! Do men always do what you want? What about Norman? Do you like him? He's handsome. A bit strange though. Strange, how? It's hard to say. He's different. Italo would like us to go to Africa together. Africa? Yeah. His folks are in Somalia. He wants to live there, work selling new trucks for Berto. And you? I don't know. I miss Jack. We were so in love. And I was in love with Gino. It's nice to love only one man. - One at a time. - No, one forever. - But I guess you were right. - About what? Love. You do forget. And life goes on. I like new men in my life. It's not true that all men are alike, you know? Did you and Italo go to bed yet? Before he sleeps with me he insists I say I'm in love with him. I wish you had, 'cause I'm dying to know if black eyes are good or not! Do you think Tony has a girl? - He does okay in Ferrara. - Did he tell you that? He never mentions it. But Italo told me he's famous in every whore house in Ferrara. He's famous? Whore's like him a lot. It appears he can give any old hag a great time... No! That's incredible isn't it! Not our Tony! He's got something but it's hard to tell just what it is. What, what is? He's got... Well, I don't know what he's got. You and I ought to go to a whore house too! - What! I mean it. There ought to be whore houses also for ladies. Tell me, doing it in bed... do you like it? Why don't you? I get more worked up doing it in the country or in a car, in the movies. In bed, I can come only by squeezing my legs together. Well, then let the guys spread. Just as long as you both agree on it. There are men who say that a lot of girls are frigid. That's stupid, no girl is frigid, they don't exist. Only guys who don't know how to do it. For example, that one. With the robe on? - I can see him nude! - Nude, no! Sure, look at all those hairs going down his belly all the way to his donger. His is timid look. It's all shrivelled up. He's got no arse at all! I think all men should be looked at arse first. Right, it gives you the whole picture. Look at that one! There's a bummer. A professor. Lawyer! A mechanic. A Queer! Wanna Dance? We don't understand. We are French. Do you speak English? Wanna dance? We have a car too. Okay, just one dance but that's all. Our husbands are very jealous. - Good evening, boss. - Hi. Did they tire you out in Ferrara? Not in the least. Would you like to see? Were they pretty? I'm not complaining. Is that the way you get them excited, those bitches? You bet, I know plenty of ways to get them going. Think there should be whore houses for women just the same as for men, don't you think so? Eh, Tony? There are plenty of very good places where men come and go as they please and a woman like you can take her pick. Like this inn, for example, big boy... Oh, I wouldn't even imagine... It's up to you... Stop right there. But why should I stop if the others don't? Stop I said! But look Miranda ... - Don't forget you're an employee here! - And you're my boss. Bravo. You've managed to keep your thoughts together no thanks to all those whores you satisfied. Stop it now, Tony, you're finished, you hear. I only wanted to give you the cash for the ring I sold. That's what I like about you. You're useful, I can rely on you. Oh, and the copy, have you got it yet? There is no copy. One of my lady friends bought the ring. Dirty bastard, you put my nice ring on one of your whore's hands. Well, look what I sold it for. Count it. She paid twice as much as any one else would've. She gave me a lot. Gave you a lot, huh? Cash or trade? Cash, of course. You know nobody looks at me, right boss? It's all for you anyhow. It's enough, I hope, to pay whatever new bills I get. For as long as I'm away. Where? Don't I have the right to go away? Yeah, you're the boss. You can do whatever you want. You approve, do you? I depend on you, Tony. The inn is in your hands. Don't worry, I'll look after your interests for you. You're a guy who knows what he's doing. Why, don't you? Do you like it? - It makes me cry a little. - Well, there's nothing wrong with that. Sit down. How'd you like an ice-cream. Another One! More drills shipped, they were unloaded this morning. Work's finished. Well? No! Norman, Norman, no! Come here! Come! Go on! Let's fuck. Hey you, leave that dog alone. I'm a civil servant and you're interfering with the law. How much for the dog? Not a penny! I have my dignity as official dog catcher, you know. Here's dollars, American dollars. You can have them. Oh, he's cute. Go away. Go on, go away! Please, go away! Don't you know how lucky you've been today. Hey, the war's over. Slow the jeep down, will you. You're a 'mascalzona'. Go on say it again. Ma-scal-zo-na! Ma-scal-zo-na! Hey, would you watch that! You some kind of nut? But... Yes! This spot is where the Nazi's got me. April 13th 1944. It was here where the Scar is. It was night, I was lucky. There were only a few, they were afraid to come down. I spent the whole night looking up at those two trees. Grass, blood, money and shit. A monument. C'mon, let's go. I want something to drink, then I want you. Let's stop at the first village. I'm starving. I'm goin' to eat. It's there. Right between the legs of the ballerina. There This is it. This is what moves the world. Right between the thighs of all women. Tender clouds, I wanna die there. Miranda! Yes you're right. Get over here. We will cross the river and will rest in the shade of the trees. I wanna die... Not in the jerry. I want to die, I want to die in a wave. I wanna die on top of you, Miranda. On top of you. Norman, Oh, my love. I want your thigh. Darling, come on. A hole here... I wanna make a hole in you and take you in that hole. Yeah, do it. You can do it if you want. Just me, mine, forever. Yours. Oh, baby. Miranda, baby. Oh, darling... Norman? You hear me, darling? Please, Norman. Wine, wine! Long live Bacchus and love! Both console us. One passes through our lips to our heads and the other from our eyes to our hearts. So I drink this wine, with my eyes and then I do the same as you. Just a minute, quiet please, everyone. I shall miss you all a great deal. I asked for my old post in Damascus. That's where I started my career. So at long last they put you back on the road. Yes, the purge is finally over, my exile has come to an end and you might say I'm back in the government's good graces. Long live the Consul Carlo! It was very nice of you to invite us all here. So now you're gonna leave us? - Wanna dance with me? - I would be delighted -Leda? -I'm ready. Wanna dance, honey? What kind of music is that, Tony? Play one of those records that I brought, will ya? This one, okay? - That's the one I'm on, go right ahead. - But I can't, Leda. - Sure you can. No, Miranda, ask somebody else. Ah. Carlo, come. - Isn't he wonderful? - He's American. A great guy. It's worth it, It's worth it, Leda! Until the end I never stopped hoping that one day you might reconsider. I can't Carlo. You know that. I can't help it. But I still feel bound to Gino. I can't get him out of my heart. Liar, you know there's no possibility of him ever returning. But besides it was you who said that nothing mattered except this. I didn't know you that well then. Hey, Carlo! What are you trying to say? Just that now other things mean a lot more to me. At this moment there's one and only one thing. Miranda, Miranda! Why do you always avoid me? Avoid? I'm here holding you, can't you feel it, Carlo? You've got such lovely thighs. I dream about them. About your aroma. Your impudent eyes. That's what I like to hear. Pretend I'm not Miranda. That I'm another woman. Someone young and fresh and completely devoted to you. No-one else interests me. Juliette, for example. Did you see her? She's looking for someone to settle down with. I've seen her all naked. Close your eyes and think about her. Her thighs, her hand. Imagine it's Juliette's caresses... You, - No you! - Me! Do you know what I've done, Carlo? I even sold the ring you bought me to pay some bills. Yes, yes. That's one more reason for loving you. It's a downpour. Come on, please. You've pissed me off! That's a rotten son of a bitch! No! Not the phonograph, no! Stop fighting! Calm yourselves! Oh, stop it! About time there was some rain. Sing, go on, sing. Stop fighting! Oh, stop it! Norman! Norman! Norman, Norman! That son of a bitch started it! He did? Yes and it's your fault! Can't any of you see it's raining? Let's go! Everyone back home. C'mon. - I only wanted to separate them. - Calm down. Come on, move it. Small Fight! "Listed as missing must be presumed dead." Don't go, Gino, don't go. Quedatela. Take it, I leave it to you, it's yours. Turn around. I don't believe you never done that before. I don't care what you believe. Gino, tell me I didn't hurt you. No, you were great. What are you thinking? Nothing, just laughing. What was your husband like? othing at all like you! You just like to switch around? Why not? You like one man because he's got something special, then you find something else in another. What have I got? Your smell. I'm crazy about it. Let's go away together! Go where? Far, to where everyone's different. They're not all the same here. You, for example. I'm only passing through. I take what I find that's all. And I made myself easy to find. Miranda, ask me for anything. Keep me running all night long, okay? What are you thinking about? Not a thing! I feel the music in the air! I can feel it too! Sure you can work here. We've got a room for you. Right, dad? Get me a grappa. Is anyone upstairs? Only Leda, no one else came home last night. They're completely through with the gas line. Even Norman gave up his room. That's because he was all alone. Juliette went with the Consul and Gabrielle with Berto. Looks like we'll be all alone, uh? Well, there'll be lots of others, you'll see. Not today. Put the closed sign up, will you? Tell Leda we don't need her today. And you get all clean and after come and see me and we'll talk a little. And stop drinking. Well, I'm celebrating. I don't have to work today. You didn't have to bring coffee. It wasn't necessary. Well, I could leave it here. But if it's not necessary... we could forget about it. Get under the covers. Stop right there. I'd like us to be married. Wait, I haven't tested you. Let's not forget I haven't either. Well, I'd like to begin by discussing some business matters. Business and bed. I'm giving you the choice. We can be married or you can be a peasant again. And if I marry you, what am I then? Part owner of the inn, alright! But 'Gino's' what this place is called. Well, put a sign up calling it 'Miranda's'. Everybody'll be delighted. The men will, I know that. Well, so what? If I marry I suppose... well then what? You can begin by learning to love me and stop calling me "Boss". It's mine, Tony. Yeah, it's yours. No, what I mean is that it's mine. - Look. - Oh my God! Oh, please, Miranda! I can't stand it anymore! Do you still want to discuss finances? Tony! Oh, Tony! Tony, what are you doing? I am going to keep them forever. It's beautiful! Carlo and Juliette from Naples, you simply showered me with gifts! Have you had any news from the American? Norman's just not the sort to go back to the same place. In person, with a letter or anything. Italo and I are going to get married in Africa. I don't know what kind of a ceremony they have there. And now off we all go to Bologna. I've reserved at "Le due torri". Oh Berto! That's wonderful! Thank you! I've rented the car from an earl in Mirandola, any complaints? Hurry! C'mon, get in. Wait a minute, Berto. Where's Miranda gone? Where's she going? You know, her first husband died during the war. Hurry up! - Goodbye! - Get in, everyone's waiting for you. Goodbye! Goodbye! Good luck. Have a good journey! Bye, bye! It's wonderful to get into a bed with new sheets and a new cover. But I'd rather look at you. What do you want to look at? Everything! Light the fire if you want to see more. Jumps right up. What's so funny? Don't you get it? You're terrible, you know that! Here. You finish it. Lie down. I beg you Miranda, please! Warmer, and warmer ... That's not bad. A paradise of erotic beauty, huh? I beg you, Miranda. I beg you. I beg you, I beg you, I beg you! I beg you! Is that all you can say? This is the second time you've begged me. It's funny, I wonder if someday I'll have to beg you. I like your natural colour hair better.
