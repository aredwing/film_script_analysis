Haven't had a wink all night. How come? I picked up a brilliant babe last night. Just when I thought she was mine she slammed the door into my face. Since that moment I've had a hard on strong like a fortress. Wouldn't fall. Like a defense line around Sarajevo. That's tough. It's not healthy to have a hard on like that. I can't help it. I see her everywhere. Even on the wall we need to paint I see her. I can't see a thing. How can you say that? Enough of that - Let's work. Still hot. Pour some water over it. It wouldn't do. I tried to put some ice but it melted. Common! I can't. I'm stuck. It hurts. Should I call an Ambulance? Call whoever you want, just help me! They are across the street. They will come in a minute. If you keep on talking, they won't be here in an hour. Hallo? Emergency? My friend got stuck. He's got his thing in the wall and can't get it out. No, he is not bleeding. We are in the white house across the street, painting the garage. Please, hurry! Thanks. They are coming. You do the talking. I get embarrassed with strangers. THE RHYTHM OF LIFE OK. You keep quiet. I'll deal with it. Thanks. - You are a true friend. Here they are. - Fast, aren't they? What the hell is this? Hello. We thought someone got hurt at the construction site. My friend got stuck, he can not get it out. We tried everything. These fuckers will cause my death. Is he a piece of work or what? Can you help him? We need to paint this. I am going to retire in two hours. How about a beer? Yes, please. - Yes, please. Why did this trouble have to happen today? You know, a nutcase like this one almost made me quit my job a short while before my retirement. He used to get stuck everywhere. But not in the wall. Let me tell you that story... Up the hill, by the graveyard there is a famous restaurant with the sign: "NO ENTRY FOR POLITICIANS". Good evening! Look at her! She looks like Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn was invented by American Administration so that President can screw around. They invented the likes of them as well to screw the whole world. Get out! Get out! I do not want to see you here ever again! I do not welcome politicians in my restaurant nor do I welcome talking about politics. Get out! Sorry! We got carried away. You can get carried away somewhere else. Get out! Dearest, let us grab a bite! My empress. - Love birds... Mammy's beautiful girl. Come! Have dinner with us. I am not a child any more. Don't bug me. You are always going to be our child. Fine, then your child should buy some new cloths. No problem, but first a bite. Bye. "Today is my lucky day- fertile day, fertile day!" Wait a minute! We need to talk. Later. Not later. Now! It's important. This is more important. No! Now. If you are good now I will tell you a story later on. What? What is going on? She is coming! Down! - What? Get down! The temperature is ideal now. Let me first finish this car. It can wait. I can't. - Let's go to the bedroom. I want you here and now. Wait! I am dirty. I should take a shower first. I want you just like that. Majo, h-h-hi. - Hi, Nedim. I w-wou-would like t-to ask you so-some-something. Some other time. I am tired now. N-no p-pro-problem. Hi, there. Good morning. I'm Maja. And you? I'm Medlin Albright. Got some money? What for? I want to eat. For sure? I swear on my bread. How did you get your name? - After Madeleine Albright, of course. Come with me to eat. Good morning. - Morning, dear. Can I get some coffee? Who is the young lady? - Madeleine Albright. I see now why she looks so familiar. What would you like to drink? - A cup of coffee for me, too. Isn't it a little early for you to have coffee? No, it isn't. It is a morning. Of course, coffee is the best in the morning. Coming right up. What is wrong? You look upset. I am just tired. Sure? Everything OK? You worry too much. - I have to. Tell me frankly, when was the last time you had a decent meal? All you have are 2 liters of water in the morning, half a banana for lunch and after 6 o'clock you eat nothing. I have lived quite a life but have never met a hungry... - But happy person. Coffee with milk for Medlin and black coffee for you... But you should first eat something. Could I once have my coffee without you mentioning the food? But you must eat. Mammy, please... - I know. I can eat! Well honey, this is for us and happiness that awaits us. This is so nice. - Of course it is. I never tried... - You will try it all with Muharem. Now you are mine and should never worry about anything, You hear me? Now, look! You do it like this, and then like that... Now, you do it! Bravo! I will make you the happiest woman alive. You will be happy and you will know nothing else but happiness. You know? Muharem has something else for you. What is this? A napkin. - This, what is this? Muharem... I hope your answer is a "Yes". I planned our wedding. I feel like I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming... Here are the sausages. - I'm going to bed. Don't go anywhere. Aunt Uma is coming. You know how much she wants to see you. So we are going to hear more stories about witchcraft and magic. Is there anything real in her life? That is how she is but she is the family. It is so nice to see you all together. Good to see you, Daut. - Come on, sit down! You always know when the love of your life is about to come! Didn't you say you would take a few days off? I don't know where to go. I feel the best here. When is she coming? You have no idea, do you? - I don't, I swear. Let him be. He comes for a drink and you bug him. I was just saying how nice it is that they have been divorced for 12 years but Uma and he love each other more than many married couples ever would. Isn't it so? Pour us a drink. - Let him be. I only say the truth. - I am used to his teasing. Cheers, lover-boy! I could do this everyday! Then comeback tomorrow! Stop it, Muharem. Stop it! Muho, what is this?! Why? I want you so badly! You should not have... We could've gone to your place. Honey, with all the money we've got, we may go wherever we want. We shall go to our apartment, but after the wedding. Stop it! Why should I? Maja was a real beauty. I wonder what she saw in him. He is a crook, thief, smuggler of cars... You wouldn't believe how sexy she was! All his other girlfriends were lovely too. I stayed under that stupid car like an idiot. Why is this happening to me? Why? Calm down! What do you mean? Do you love me at all? I don't understand how can you humiliate me like this? When we met I was married, it didn't bother you then. What do you want me do to? Leave my wife? No way! That's it? - That's it! You, women, think that you are the center of the world! If you can't take this as fun, we can stop seeing each other. We definitely could! And we will. It's a promise! Emotionless bastard! Reseller of stolen cars! How could I be so blind? Moron! You will get over it. It will be OK. You' re a good person and can always find someone nice. What's wrong with you? Nobody died. Excuse me, I thought you were not feeling well! Why? It's not as though I was running a marathon. I only broke up with Damir. I am furious! He should've not treated me the way he did. M-m-majo I w-w-would like t-to ask y-you s-so-some-something? Not now! Later! N-no pro-problem. Bye. It's almost ready. No one makes grilled meat like you do. It's all about the balance... getting it right... ... and cooking time. I keep saying: the right balance is what life is all about. Isn't it, Daut? - No, it isn't. Only with love the balance doesn't matter. You talk wisely. Let's have a toast. The girls are coming. I am off. My little girl! Come here! Auntie, you never change. Let us eat now! - Thanks but I really can't. An inevitable topic in this house is always food. Damned be those who treat it with no respect. Stop fooling around! Food means life. It means high cholesterol, diabetes, digestion problems... You are telling me prisoners in concentration camps are tortured by being forced to eat and not to starve. Enough, you two! Who wants to eat, shall do so. It is crucial that we get together. So? - So, what? Isn't there a handsome someone ready to buy a ring? Why would I need a ring? To hurt me when my hands get swollen? There must be someone. Is something worrying you? You should talk to me. No, auntie. Where did you get that? You know that I see it all. Enough, you two! She will get married when the time comes. Why aren't you so liberal when it comes to food? Uncle Salih, you really need to lose some weight. No way. I eat what I want. You'd better be careful with your diets! Let's go while they are enjoying their food. What's the deal with Salih, Maja... that restaurant and food...? Bear with me. I will explain it all. In life all things are connected, the point is in the balance. There is a cause and consequence to everything. If you listen carefully and bear with me, at the end you will see it's all about balance. Here it is. You should sit next to me. My ex... ... and the future... - We shall see about that. What is it in those men that makes us suffer? We are more subtle. In chromosomes we are more beautiful and more attractive. He is not going to get away that easily. My body is more tempting than a hairy one of man. How come we reach orgasm only when they slobber over us with their sweaty bodies? Our skin is softer. Feel it! One never knows if it is a day or night in here. I thought you might want to eat something. This was really good. You are right. It is time for Maja to get married. When did you start thinking of your princess getting married? It doesn't matter when? From now! What's got into you now? - What's wrong with you? It is time for her to get married, to have a family. What is wrong with that? Nothing is wrong. Nothing... But you've never mentioned it before. It was not the right time. Now it is. Excuse me, could you come for a second? Good afternoon. How can I help you? Hello, do you have venison? We do serve it, Sir. Is it fresh or frozen? How does it look like? Bad, it looks extremely bad. What do you mean? Well see, she was first hunted down by dogs. Afterwards, hunters shot her with a bullet. Wounded... ... she tried to get away, but then the dogs caught up with her, the hunters slaughtered her and butchered her skin. I bought one leg and the ribs. So, now you think for yourself how bad she is... Bad, really bad. What should it look like after all? Where have you been? Everyone let me down but I was hoping I would see you. How about something to eat? - OK, boss. That's my girl. Uma let me introduce you to our Medlin Albright. This is Uma. - Glad to meet you. So am I. What grade are you at? None. - What do you mean? Don't you go to school? No. I have a job. Give me your hand! What sort of a job? Well, I beg on the streets. I have to. Who told you that? You have to go to school. None of us go to school; neither Hilary, Clinton ... nor Monica. Your hands are so cold. Daut, is the meal for our girl ready? It is coming. I've never seen such a nice wedding procession. Such great cars were never seen here... Would do anything for my Hana. - Hush now! You probably find it awkward arriving to Sarajevo in a van, but I wanted to make a statement entering Olovo, do it with a style. I could've hired drivers. No big deal. But, it is better this way, more family oriented and friendly. - You are right. I asked some friends to wash the cars before we leave for the City Hall... It is not right to arrive there in dirty cars. You can rest here for a second. Give me half an hour... even less. Where did you find these imbeciles? Every time one imbecile dies, two new ones are born. Money? - Everything OK? They drove the cars away and never suspected anything. Even if anyone did, it's too late. Let's go! Tell me what's bothering you? What time is it? Get up, we need to talk. - Can't it wait? There is no time. Life is too short to spend it sleeping. What's so important? - You are. Who is he and what happened? What happened? You know that I see everything. I read that the trouble is caused by a man. My dear auntie. Don't worry! All I want is to help you. They are not coming. Look what time it is. So, he is a married man. We can ruin that marriage and bring him back to you. No, I want him to suffer. - Suffer? How much? A lot. I want him never to find joy again but to feel only pain. Are you sure, my dear child? Yes, I am. Come here. A gentleman - you said? A charlatan! I knew it from the moment I saw him. He embarrassed me in front of my whole family. How to face them now? - Something has happened to him. What could've happened to him? My God. Let's go. With all those cars, one could have had a flat tire! Get up! Let's go! Let's wait a few more minutes! - Get up, I said! What did I do wrong?! Don't worry! He will get what he deserves. You'll be mine! I will be yours if you don't kill me. Now you will see what Lajla knows. You are an intellectual? Aren't you? No intellect needed here! Get up! It hurts! I can't! It hurts! Take it out! It is killing me! Wait! Stop it! Hallo, Emergency? Remember when we saw him for the very first time? How can I forget? I cursed that day thousands of times. When someone is ill, that is one thing. But this... ... he got a hard on and we had to carry him around. Even worse, we had to carry two persons. The stretcher almost broke down, my back as well. I was so embarrassed I could not wait to put him in the vehicle and finish with it. I thought it was an accident, but no. Where is Maja? Did she eat? No, she is in her room with Uma. What are they doing? - I have no idea. Get them. Dinner is ready. Salih asked you to join us for dinner. What are you doing? - Nothing. Making the setting right to better enjoy aunt's stories. Since when do you like her stories? They are interesting. I am hungry. Let's eat. Common, while they are still hot. I want some. We've got talking and I lost a track of time. I feel like I've not eaten at all. So, are you finally going to buy a TV set? I miss 20 episodes of my favorite soap opera every time I visit you. We are the only family in the 21st century without a TV set. As though only politicians are shown on TV. I don't want to see them anywhere, let alone TV. They tricked me once... and never again. I was waiting for you. That's it? I'm tired. Please, don't! - Just relax. What's this? Wait, wait! It hurts! We didn't have a decent break, we barely left him... when the phone rang again. It is an emergency! My wife and I got stuck! No, not in the elevator. With one another. Hurry up! It is an emergency! Address? Defenders of Sarajevo #7. Now everything will return to normal. Is this moron ever going to score without us having to... ... know about it? God only knows what he's got between his legs! It's the second blond today. It's again up to us to carry him around. Give him that and let's finish with him. Stay put! I will ask Maja to come down. You will taste my specialty, the mixed grilled meat for four. You were in the concentration camp? True but I survived it. I was abroad. Nice. I mean smart. Here is my dear daughter. When she gets married daddy will take care of everything. Very good, very good. - Dad?! Cheers! - Cheers! It's not my fault. It just happened. Sometimes it does. I am not saying it's your fault or anyone else's. It's better if we stopped seeing each other. That's all. I am off now. I am off now! Such a nice young man! Nothing wrong with him. Well brought up... Leave her alone. Why are you pushing her to get married? It's high time she got married. He was so nice. Besides, he is a man. What do you say about a cake? Why not! You are my darling! Hi, Nedim. I-is M-Maja home? Yes, she is. Still asleep but she will come soon. Sit down. Something to drink? O-ok. C-co-coffee, p-please. In a second. A stronger drink, perhaps? I w-wan-wanted to ask Ma-Maja s-some- so-something... All right, I'll make some coffee. - Ok. Maja, wake up! Nedim is waiting for you in the restaurant. Nedim, who? What does he want? Have no idea. He is in the restaurant waiting for you. Come! I sa-said it aaa-ll, op-penly to h-his fa-face. I said it a-all. This poor gentle boy, seems to be from another planet. He looks so unreal, because of his kindness and wandering around grave yards. What are you looking at? Nothing. Nedim was waiting for Maja all morning long... While you were drinking. No, we were just talking. I was keeping him company. I wonder what you were talking about... I have no idea. He speaks like a politician. Can't understand a thing. What? Wi-will you m-ma-marry me? What are they doing? - Nedim is offering a ring to Maja. Do you think that marriage is a joke? Nedim is leaving. She pushed him away. G-good... ...- Bye Why didn't she explain it to him kindly? Are you Serif's children? - Yes, we are. Where is he? Will you ask him to come out? Daddy! I am Serif. You are? - Yes, I am. Listen, we need to talk. OK? - OK. What is it? Nothing. Tell me. He'll certainly stop thinking of women for a while. Where is Lajla? I don't know. For some reason she's been avoiding me lately. Good for you. I know she likes Damir. Then let her see what a harsh intercourse is. Everything seems so sad and empty. Relationships and friendships. It is all based on pure interest. That's the way it goes. Did you see what papa did to our bathroom? I am not sure that such a relationship and love exist anywhere else. - And it's getting stronger. Here is coffee. - The bathroom is finished. There you are. - Thank you. Everything is done according to your sketches. Let me then pay you and we're all happy: me with your work, you with your payment. Count it. - It is OK. This is the first time I did something like that. Good afternoon! No sound, only motion! Free choice for everyone. - Right! We lived a happy life together. Nowadays, the youth hardly knows how to love. Do you remember our wedding? I do. You know how much I've loved you? Now it is a hundred times more. Not a hundred - a thousand times more. If I could only put in words how much I love you? I know my dear, I know. It doesn't matter. Good evening, my ladies. I will be your waiter tonight. Bring us everything and some home-made brandy for me. I'd like to order as well: some grilled vegetables and a glass of red wine. You know what I need. Good evening! I am laying in bed next to Daut but my eyes are wide opened. At that very moment I felt like I was laying next to my brother. I thought to myself it's become too much of a habit. That is how the two of us got divorced. I wonder who showed them the way? Just what we need - the medics coming to our street. It might be something serious. Remember when we carried him by the restaurant? Yes, and that vehabi walking behind us in his slippers. And that madman of ours dressed like a women, got into action. Someone is being carried away. Aunt, that's Damir. Didn't I tell you that he will get what he deserves? What are you two whispering? Hush, now! Nothing Mammy, nothing. I remember that poor women below him weeping in pain, all those people around the fences staring. I wanted to castrate him. That was all I could think of, I swear. Hello there! Why don't you join us for a drink? My dear Fatir, it's all about temptation. Thank you for your kind words. Are you sure you don't want some? No, thank you. It is a sin. I really do not know what to say. My late grandfather used to say all sins come out of a mouth not within. You said you wanted him to suffer. His desire makes him suffer. To your health. We can call his clinch also the "mixed meat" But this is for two persons only. Without aunt's intervention, we would've not carried that maniac around. Frankly, he deserved it. It was good that someone got to him as well. No! Don't! I have some cars to take care of. Stop. Stop it! - What's wrong with you? I'm scared. I'm tense. I'm not ready yet. Look, the Ambulances and stuff, it's all so humiliating. I don't want you to go through that all over again. Don't worry. Everything will be OK Please, I can't. I am not ready. I promise you, everything will be fine. I wish I could prepare mixed meat for four, gather the four of us around the table and eat. - What four? The family - you, me, Maja and a husband of hers. You'd better start making it for two persons. No way. The recipe is for four, so four it is. Look who is coming! Everything is as we agreed. All kids are going to school. You see that good will can do miracles. I can't be late. - Wait a second! Here is some pocket money for the pupil. Give me your hand. Goodbye! - Goodbye! You know, everyone has a right to a decent life, children and adults alike. It is not fair that some children have it all, while others haven't got even a hope. Finally, it is not fair that I spend my last working day pulling a maniac out of the wall. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. How can I help you? I need, you know... - Vibrators? Penises with the strip on. I'd suggest something like this; silicon with adjustable panties Hard enough? - It is. That's what I need. Here is a rabbit bunny, it is trendy - this piece rotates this one vibrates. Look at this, panties included and adjustable. There is also a silicon one... vibrating with slips. Hard enough? - Yes. You have this one with slips. That will be enough. - This one, adjustable. Wrap all of these for me, please. With all that, you get a special cream for longer and harder erection, free of charge. No, thank you. Just a little bit more, a little bit more. Stop! Don't move! Stop right here! For God's sake what's that? Reconnaissance! The phone rung. It's him again. He gave us the address, we got there... surprise... He vanished. What has become of that man? He is now trying to trap us. Where is Maja? - She is asleep. Would you, please, wake her up? Let her sleep. You know she never eats breakfast. I would like to have her with us. What's wrong, my darling? What is it, my love? Maja!! I envy you. You're gonna retire. I deserve it. I really do. I've seen enough of other people's misery. Far too much! Didn't I tell you how bad it is when the Ambulance finds its way to the street. - Hush! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Please, go away from me. Honey, let me help you. - I need no help from you. Just get away from me! Come to get a shower! I need nothing! If I stink get out. Leave me alone! Maja went to talk with the doctor. She will be back in a minute. It will be all right. Everything will be fine. What happened? Everything will be fine. I know. What is the diagnosis? Get me off of this machine. Book a grave lot and buy a coffin! Coffee, anyone? I thought you already finished. Don't worry, Madame. We'll take care of it. What do you mean by that? I certainly don't intend to demolish this wall. Madame got confused. You are so beautiful. You are not going to leave without me. My princess, you are not going to be sad. Imagine if we never met... But we did and we will never grow apart. Dinner is ready. - Great. I'm going to get them. No, I don't want to go. Is he heavy? I had enough. This fucker will make me quit, I swear. I do not understand that woman's mind. She suffers because of him. I don't know what's on her mind, but he something else! I'm happy. This is the way it should be. Who else could follow the recipe so well but your own child? That other child must get the necessary education, too. The Medlin Albright - illiterate? It can't be. To have a kid with no education in 21st century would be a shame. This makes me happy too. My own child ate all the food. My dear butterfly, let's go to our bedroom. You are not leaving without me. What happened to the madman? Bear with us. We'll tell you all about it. His brain got to the size of a pill. A pill can cure but no one had any use of his brain. It is a lucky day, fertile day, fertile day. They are dead! It is a lucky day, fertile day, fertile day. What a love story! If you haven't seen this you haven't seen it all. It is easy to die. That is the easiest thing to do. What about us? What are we going to do? I did not expect this from you. But so be it, so be it... Don't, Daut! It is easy to lose pride, as they both used to say. Let's go home, child! He had enough. - Yes, he did. So? Tell me! Cute, handsome, the best. When are you going to get a new job? This one is too risky. It is risky but it pays well. You don't expect me to apply for a job with the Employment Agency at this age? I want to hear more? - Cute, handsome, the best... Come in. Come in. Aunt and I can't eat all that food by ourselves. I am not offering a cruise tour to you. It is only dinner. What are we going to do with Leka? With whom? - Him. As far as I am concerned I am officially retired. Are you? Congratulations. I know what we should do. THE END
