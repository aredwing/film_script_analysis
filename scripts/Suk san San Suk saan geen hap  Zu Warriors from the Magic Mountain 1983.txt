Mount Zu was of great military strategic importance in ancient China. As such, it was constantly in a state ofwar, regardless of reign and dynasty. But in Chinese legends and folklore, Mount Zu was also a place of mystique. For it harbored numerous exotic peaks and old temples from which many legends were born. This was where our story, "Zu, Warriors from the Magic Mountain" began. It was in the 5th century, China has been suffering from decades of civil wars and unrest. Get me the scout immediately! Scout Ti Ming-Chi reporting to 1st and Where are the Yellow Troops now? Reporting to 1st Commander. The Yellow Troops have been defeated and fled in disarray. They have now made it down to San-Chang Creek. That's wonderful! We'll take to the waters to finish our attack. soldiers ofthe Yellow Troops are already wounded and in disarray. Moreover, any attack will hurt the many civilians along San-Chang Creek. Then we will go after them on land. You may lead the way. I want not a soul to be spared! Yes, Commander! The land route meanders and is too dangerous. Ti Ming-Chi, lead the way by water! Let's go by the water. No way. The waters take too long and will give the enemy an opportunity to retreat. We'd better go by land! Nonsense! Go by water! Go by land. By water! Ti, whose orders do you obey? I obey both your orders. That's insubordination! I'll kill you! Then I will obey neither one of your orders! That's worse! Kill him! Kill him! My two Commanders, that's not what I meant! Stop! I am not the enemy! Kill...Kill... A boat? Get me across the river. I can't. Why not? The sword behind me says no. Move aside! - West Zu soldier? - East Zu soldier? West Zu soldier, this is not a battlefield. You're right. Then put away your sword. You put away yours first. No. You first! After you! Gentlemen, no need to fight over this. I'll count to three, and you'll both put away your swords. Ready...Set... Hey, I thought you said we're not going to fight! Four generations of my ancestors were killed by East Zu soldiers. I have to avenge their deaths. So? Your soldiers killed five generations of my ancestors! How should I figure those lives?/ Fine. Let the sword do us justice. Fine. I'm not afraid ofyou. I'll slash you... I'll Block... I slash... Block... I slash, slash, slash... I block, block, block... I slash, slash... I block... Bad news for you. My reinforcements are here. How do you know they're yours? May be they're mine. That's easy enough. Just take a look at the color ofthe arrow. Get one and see for yourself. They're really my reinforcements. How could you know? You didn't even get an arrow in here. No need. I could tell by my touch. You don't believe me? Take a look yourself. You take a look first. They're for neither one of us. They're yellow! Front or rear ofthe boat? Rear! Get them out ofthe water! Yes! Don't you worry. I'm tired from fighting all these years. I won't fight you anymore. I'm leaving. I won't fight... I said I won't fight you anymore... Your water bottle! It is my water bottle! Are you all right? You are so big, but such a timid cat! Hey, we just met. I didn't know ifyou're a good or bad guy. By the way, where are you from? I'm from the village on the left side of Nan-An. Really? We're practically neighbors! I'm from the village on the right! No wonder your face looked so familiar. You're not such a bad guy! We're both good men. We're just dressed in different colors. That's the crux of our problem. The country is so divided. We can chat so nicely here. But ifwe were on the battlefield... Charge... Not again! Charge! Charge! This sure is a colorful battle! Forget about the colors. Let's pretend to fight. No one will notice! Are you for real? Just fake it! Don't fight so hard! Should we carry on? You watch the front, I mind the back. First chance we get, we slip away. Let's get going then! Stop showing off. Let's go! Ouch! Why did you hit me so hard? Nice reaction! Chubby, I'm over here! Don't worry! Let me help you! Three against one. We're on the same side. Get him! Get him! Six against three... Get them! Nine against six! All of us against him! Charge... Run! Let's pretend we're dead! Just let them fight it out. Wonder when they'll be through? Not too long, I hope. You guys are pretending too? Oh, it's the Yellows again! There's still the Red and the Blue. Don't let them get away. Go after them! You go on ahead. I'll divert them here. No way. We're friends! I can't leave you here like this! One alive is better than two dead! Run! No! Go! Who pushed you off? Mommy! Help! Swordsman! My Savior! Please don't go so soon. You have something to say to me? Swordsman, you must know the world is plagued with war and destruction. With your remarkable kung-fu and abilities, you must rescue us from this plight. Wars and unrest are perpetual throughout the history of men. But the troubles were all caused by men who kill each other and have no respect for human lives whatsoever. Woe onto them! There's nothing you or I can change. You should go into seclusion in the mountains while you can still tell right from wrong. Please do not give up, Master. If everyone can give their best, peace will come. So you're lecturing me now! But I'm afraid this is just not your time. Ifyou do not leave now, you will become one ofthem! Swordsman! Swordsman! Swordsman! Swordsman! Swordsman! All legendary swordsmen come and go in mysterious ways. He's testing me now. Fine. I'll wait for him right here. I've finally waited for you to show! That was a very foolish thing to do in a hell like this. This is so danger here. Hell will be waiting for you. Hell? That's why all the skulls are here! This must have been a battleground. No. All the skulls bear the sign ofthe Evil Disciples. To train their evil sorcery, the Evil Disciples needed bones of virgins. These children were the sacrifice. Bones of virgins? Now you know why I wanted you to get out of here. Is it because I'm still a virgin? Thank God! You're wrong. It doesn't matter whether you are or not. The Evil Disciples will not let you live. Besides, no one will believe you're a virgin anyway! So, why were you waiting for me? I want to be your student. I've always been a loner. Then change your bad habit as oftoday! Teacher...Teacher...Teacher! I'm not your teacher. Ifyou teach me how to fight, I will help the meek and fight the bad. I will not take you as my student. Teacher...Teacher... Keep calling me and I'll vanish. All right. I'll shut up. Please come out! It's the Blood crows! Unsheathe! Stars shine in seventh heavens. The moon lights up the earth. Evil...Evil... Calm yourself. They're on our side. Hsiao-Yu of Kun-Lun. Ting-Yin of Nan-Hai. Ting-Yin. Abbott Hsiao-Yu. So your name is Ting! It's none ofyour business! It's been ten years! Did Long Brows ask you to come too? Monk, he asked me to lend you a hand. Just a couple of Blood crows had you rattled. How can you handle the Blood Demon? Damn you. Praise Buddha! The Blood Demon is increasingly out of control. It's best that we team up. What do you say, Monk? My mission is to save all humanity. The Evil Disciples have been carrying on their evil deeds out ofthe Old Temple. For three years, my dumb student and I have tried to track them down. We never thought we'd run into you here. It seems to me there are more than a few ofthem lurking here. What do you think we should do? Don't ask. My motto is we may share a table but I work alone. You are on your own. Monk, you haven't changed a bit! Just stay out of my way! Yi-Chen! Teacher! Virgin Boy! Master Ting. Let's go into the Old Temple. Okay. Into the Old Temple! Who's that monk? He's a most impulsive man. Hey, my friend... Virgin Boy! Are you calling me? Would you like to get a glimpse inside? Yes. Yi-Chen, come here! Yes, Teacher! Get away, Bookworm! I can't take care ofyou too! You watch out for yourself. Vegetarians have no strength. Damn you! Praise Buddha! Teacher. Be careful! Come on. The Evil Disciples welcome their valuable guests. Hey, how did you get over here? That's nothing. Just watch the show. Monk, you shouldn't have come down here. It's very dangerous. You don't have to say that. I would've helped you anyway. Who dares to trespass the Evil Disciple's alter? Who else but the most bold and daring! We are here today to destroy the root of all evil! Who are these characters? They're the bad guys, we're the good guys. Understand? To those who destroy evil, We kill! To the righteous who shun evil, We kill! To those who save humanity, We kill! To all against us, We kill! Is there anyone they spare? To those who obey us, we spare! Monk, do you think you can talk your way out of a fight today? You'd better save your energy to do battle later. That's right, Bookworm. I'll let you die in one piece! Water! Use water to put it out! That's too much! I can't take it! Monk, do you need a hand? Sheathe! Sheathe! Hey! What are you waiting for? Our years of hard work have proven to be futile! It was all my fault, Abbott. If I hadn't... Don't feel bad, young man. That's right. It's a blessing that you're still alive. Monk, when will I be blessed to see you again? No blessing for you! Let's not meet again. If it weren't for you, the evil doers wouldn't have gotten away! Don't talking nonsense. Fine! lfthat's the way you feel North, South, East, West. Pick a direction. Yin is strong today. I will head north. Then I will head south. Good! From this day on, may our paths never cross again!! Praise Buddha! Yi Chen! Yes! Let's go! Take care, Soldier. I'll see you around. Swordsman...Swordsman... Swordsman! He has vanished again. Never bothered to hear a word I said. I urged you to save the world and you disappeared without a trace! What's the use of knowing kung-fu? You are all cowards! No wonder evil and calamity have taken over the world! You said men have brought it upon themselves, but you are responsible too! I'll take charge then. I don't need any ofyou. I will manage all on my own! Don't ever come back again!! You're back! We said we'd never meet again! Why have our paths crossed? You said you were heading north and me heading south! Why did you change direction? Stop the nonsense! He's sucked away our weapons. Do something! What is happening? I'm not sure. But all these years, I've never seen my Teacher so nervous. What's going on out there? Unsheathe! Monk! Teacher! Sheathe! Let's go! Hey, Monk. We never worked together and the first time we do, it's a disaster! Just don't talk! What are you doing? I'm transfusing energy into you! This is no time for practical jokes! Jokes? I don't find it funny at all! Yi-Chen, your teacher is losing his mind! Don't let him do it! Yi-Chen! Teacher! Tell him to stop! Master Ting. Your teacher's condition is critical. I must do this to save him! Teacher! Are you disobeying your Teacher? Master Ting! Stop this nonsense! Stand guard with this young brother outside! Holler ifyou see anything! Ting, you fool! Blood Demon will take this opportunity to attack us! Yi-Chen! Go outside! Come back! Go outside! Come back! Go outside!! Where did Yi-Chen go? You'd better not show yourself! Someone came to my rescue again? That's impossible. How did these get stuck to me? What are these? Who are you? I am Long Brows, founder ofthe Ou-Mei Clan! Founder of Ou-Mei Clan, what are you doing here? I wouldn't have missed this for the world! Are you a good guy or bad? Good, of course! Do bad guys wear white? Look closer! Don't pull my beard! What do I do? I said not to pull my beard! Now what? D-o-n'-t touch!! Hey, kid. Are you calling me? Of course. Pick two rocks. Bigger ones! Follow me. Throw only when I tell you. You so-called righteous ones are vulnerable and weak. You've left an opening for me, the Blood Demon. This Monk has been poisoned by my venom. Within ten days, the venom will travel to his heart. And then he'll become the Blood Demon's double. Just remember. Evil is deadlier than righteous. What is that? His soul's exodus. Exodus? What do you mean? Even though I have destroyed his body. His soul still lives. He uses virgin skulls to protect himself and waits for the chance to resurrect. Grab my feet! Even my Sky Mirror cannot destroy his soul. We're in trouble this time. Who can control him then? For now, my Sky Mirror can subdue him. But when the Big Dipper begins to shift in 49 days, my Sky Mirror will lose its shine and will be rendered powerless. What will happen then? Then it'll be up to you. Me? Yes! Who else? It's time for the next generation to take over. Ou-Mei had two exceptional swords, Purple and Green, known as the Twin Swords. took them to Cave Beyond to study. Only these two swords can destroy the Blood Demon's soul. How do you get to Cave Beyond? It is on Heaven's Blade Peak. You must go now. Once the exodus takes place, then nothing in this world will be able to stop the Blood Demon. Did you hear me? What about you? Don't be silly. I have to stay to control him. Now go! What are you waiting for? Teacher! Kun-Lun's 18th generation disciple, Yi-Chen. Kneel down! You are now the 18th Chief ofthe Kun-Lun Clan! Take the order. These are the Chief's beads. Yi Chen! Remember, as Chief, you are responsible for the entire Clan. And for bringing glory to Kun-Lun! Teacher, don't do it! Don't mind me! How can I be the Chief like this? Where's the rock? Teacher! You think you can just kill yourself? I will find someone to cure you! I don't want you to! I want to! I don't want you to! Shut up! Who were you talking to just now? I am the Chief, l... I'm sorry, Teacher. I didn't mean to. I'll restring it. The world is in more disarray than I thought. I had originally asked you to save us mortals. Now I really can't tell who is saving who. Today is the first day ofthe 49 days. Let me get this Monk cured first. Then I'll go after the Twin Swords before time runs out. What is it? Fish. It's great down there! Really? Still trying to run? Darn it. You bad fish! It's charged! Soldier, I've got the fish here! Little Monk. What? Have you ever had fish? I was once a monk for a few days. I was told that eating cooked fish is not considered killing. Want some? Are you sure? Positive! Master Ting. That's not Master Ting! That's the Blood Demon's double! Where's that sword? Right behind you! Which one is real and which is the double? He's turned into a woman! Sheathe! Evil is omnipresent. Be careful! Yes. What is that? It's a fish. I was just about to free it. Have mercy on all living things! We'd better get going to the Fort. Good thing he didn't know the fish was cooked! Take it back. You may all leave. I cannot cure this Monk. You didn't even diagnose him. How do you know you cannot cure him? Only the Countess can cure him. Countess? We didn't know you have a Countess. The Countess has been in seclusion for years. She'll not come out and cure him, unless... Unless what? Unless he is sent by Fate. Our Fort Flame burns once everyday, sometimes long, sometimes short. During this period oftime, if she comes out, the Countess will heal anyone who comes for help. The Flame is about to burn out and the Countess has not shown yet. Looks like it is fate that the Monk does not get treated. Then what happens to my Teacher? The Fort has its rules. Now that we're here, we must abide by its rules. I, Ting-Yin, will sustain the flame even if it takes all the forces out of my body! I thought we had agreed to trust everything to fate! Yes, that's why I'm trying to stop you from creating ill fate! Hey, there's that witch! We've been trapped! Soldier...Soldier...Soldier! Master Ting. Don'tjust call every woman you see a witch! No, Master Ting. What do you mean "no"? She really looked like the witch we saw! You are witch. That was evil disguised as the Countess. You've been fooled. Now you stand guard. I have to bring his veins into unison. Bring his veins into unison? That's like teaching him how to fight! He has you to thank for that. Teacher...Teacher. Master Ting. Not a sound! I'm transfusing energy into you. Any mishap, both our veins will be shot and we'll die. What should I do? Concentrate and let your will guide you. That's no way to treat a monk! I've turned into a super man! Why are you doing this? Don't you want to save this monk? Are you cold? Very. How can we get passed these girls to get inside? Hey! What are you staring at? What a temper! It doesn't look like they'll let us through. I wonder ifthere is another entrance. I'm sure there is one in here! Let's look for it! Hey! What are you doing? Nothing. We just need to use the toilet, sister. Can we? You can't! Strangers may not wander around in the Fort! That's all right. We'll just do it right here. Don't you dare! No? I dare you! All right. You said it! You think that will scare me? You are too much! Better not tell my Teacher! Hsiao-Yu! The healing has exhausted the Countess and she needs her rest. The monk's venom has been dissolved. The two ofyou should leave the Fort. Please. Soldier, there's a hole ahead. Just get in. What kind of hole is this? Help! Help! Wake up! Are you dead? Where am l? Can't you swim? No, I can't swim. Flying swords!! You bitches! See all you want then! There goes that one too! I'm going to take you to your teachers. To show them how you're giving your Clan a bad name! I beg you. Please don't tell my Teacher. You win some, you lose some. There's nothing to be afraid of! If Teacher finds out I pulled at her pants, I will be in big trouble! Pulling her pants is no big deal! What? What now? Please don't be mad. I'll do whatever it takes to make it up to you. Just don't make this any bigger than it is. Fine. Then slap each other until my nerves are calmed. Then my nerves will not be calm! Haven't you heard that a man would rather be killed than insulted? Then I'll bring you to see your teachers. Fine with me. They're not my teachers anyway. No, no! Soldier, why don't you just slap me? I don't hit my buddies. Don't consider me your buddy. Just do it. I won't do it. Then I'll slap myself. Have a little backbone! How can you be Chief of a Clan? I was planning to give that up anyway. Block! Good thing I still have a few tricks up my sleeves. The Flame died. It is fate that we should part. Until we meet again, Countess. If it is fate that we should part, why should we meet again? If it is fate that we should part, then why did you come out to see me? I didn't come out to see you. No? Did you come out to fight me then? Ting-Yin, you are right. You must pay for the other day when you took advantage of me. Took advantage? Have you lost your mind from over exhaustion? The other day you fainted, and I tried to help you! You tell me ifthat was taking advantage ofyou. I... You tell me! Ting, you're too arrogant. I must teach you a lesson. Just two moves? That doesn't make for much of a lesson! I know you have important business to tend to. I'll let you go. Really? I'll save three moves for your return. Ifyou can wait, I will return. Good. Let's make a pledge! Yi-Chen...Yi-Chen... That's fine. You will stay to take care ofyour teacher then. You can come out now. I knew you'd follow me. You're not even armed. What do you do if something happens? You have two swords. You can give me one! I've been saving this sword for my student. Teacher! Don't misunderstand me. I'm not taking students yet. But I can let you borrow this sword for now. Take it. I guess it's better than nothing. Master Ting! Oh no, someone is in trouble! Master Ting, Master Ting! Does my face look terrible? No, not too bad. I've tried to slow the poison from spreading, but I can't control it much longer. Let's get you back to the Fort right away. Ti Ming-Chi, are you still anxious/to be my student? Bow to me three times and you'll be my student. This sword will belong to you forever! Do you obey your teacher's orders? Yes. I want you to promise me one thing. Ifwe don't make it to the Fort within three days, kill me. Did you hear me? Kill me! Kill, kill, kill! Kill... He... Oh, you got poisoned too? Hurry! Go ask the Countess to come out and save him! Abbot, whether the Countess comes out will depend on his fate. She abides by the rule ofthe Flame. Rule? Yes, Teacher. It was the same when we brought you here. Quiet! You're a Kun-Lun traitor. It is not your place to talk. The Flame? That's right. Then hurry up...hurry...hurry. Countess! How can a monk be so contemptuous? You are at the Fort, not at your own Kun-Lun Mountain! Get the Countess now or you will be sorry! Try anything and YOU will be sorry! You women have nothing else better to do than to hide here and make up these ridiculous rules. You were the reason I became a Monk! I'm wasting my breath! You! Come out ifyou have any guts at all! Otherwise stay in there forever, stupid old maid! Hsiao-Yu! We are guests here. We must not impose. I had promised the Countess that I would be back. I just didn't know it would be under these circumstances. Teacher. Student. Teacher. You are now a Nan-Hai student. You must do your duty according to the Nan-Hai Principles. "To destroy evil, even your dearest must not be spared." Do it now! Quick! To hell with fate and rules and principles! We're letting a man die because of a flame! To hell with your flame! You all have lost your minds. I won't do it! I won't kill!! Get out of my way... Get your hand off of me! It's about time! Chi Wu-Shuang. Countess. We try our best and leave the rest to fate. Do you understand? Countess, you... Just let what's meant to happen, happen. What is wrong? The Countess already used up her energy when healing you. Now to heal your friend, she is endangering her own life. Ting-Yin, I've used up my energy on your friend. Now I am too weak to help you. Ifthat is the way, then so be it. Countess, please kill me. I do plan to. I understand. "I sacrifice my life with no regrets" "We will meet again in another world" I've injured the Countess. Help her, quick! Teacher! Master Ting! Are you all right? Teacher! Master Ting! Ting-Yin! Teacher! Teacher! See, see how badly you've beaten him! All right, who makes decisions here? No one? Then I'll do it. From now on, I will be responsible for him. Let go of me! What are you doing? Do you really want to kill him? I said I'm responsible for him. Let me go! Let me go! Let go... Let go of me... You get down first. We'll figure something else. Let go of me! Do you really want him dead? Get lost, you stupid Monk! You'll have to kill me first! Countess. You must all go now. I've to break the lce Mirror and freeze this place. Countess! How will you get out then? Don't let Ting-Yin get out. Don't worry about me. Just go. Why didn't you kill him? Get out ofthe Fort now! Get out ofthe Fort now! Why? Why? Countess! It's too late! Teacher...Teacher... It's all your fault. Ifyou hadn't brought Ting-Yin here, my Teacher would be fine. You'd better get my Teacher out! You get my Teacher out! The Fort is freezing over. What are you two still doing here? It's none ofyour business! There's blood! You can't keep me here! What's happening? We'll be buried alive! We better get out! This is the only way out. Here! I've tried this hole before. I almost drowned. I'm not doing it again! You two go on ahead. I'm not going! Just drag him with us! No... No. I'll drown! Help! What's the matter? I've never left the Fort in my life. Where shall I go now? I don't know what to tell you. For men, the world is their domain. But you are a girl. And all you do is scream and cry. Perhaps you should become a nun. Life may be a little bland, but it'll fit you fine. What? Can't you just shut up? I'm not good with words, but that's how I see it. What do you want? Yi-Chen, remember Long Brows asked us to go to Heaven's Blade Peak to find Li l-Chi and the Twin Swords. We have only half a month left. Ifwe don't hurry, it will be doomsday for all when the Blood Demon egresses. We couldn't even save those in the Fort. How can we save anyone else? I was originally a soldier from West Zu, but life for a soldier was unbearable. I had hoped that someone would save us from self-destruction. Then I ran into our teachers and thought they were the ones to save us. But the so-called righteous argued endlessly and refused to unite. The Twin Swords have yet to be found, and I have already lost my Teacher. My teacher, like yours, cares only about his own clan. They talked about exorcising the demons and saving the world, but they're just a bowl of loose sand. Ifwe follow in their footsteps, we won't even be able to save ourselves. You're right. The Blood Demon got his way because my Teacher and Master Ting refused to work together. We cannot be like them. Where shall we go from here? We'll go to Heaven's Blade Peak immediately! Heaven's Blade Peak? This place is huge! We have two days left. How do we find Li l-Chi? Yes. You two are really dumb! Use your mouths! Our mouths! Lady Li l-Chi! Run! Use our mouths! That was a stupid idea! Look over there! There's an entrance down there! Heaven's Blade is fearless and shuns the world! What are you all doing here? Is he Li l-Chi? Don't be foolish. Li is a woman. You have not answered my question. Where are your manners? Did you know you almost stepped into Evil Territoryjust now? This is the border between Good and Evil. Border? By the way, who chained you here, Old Man? Nonsense! I'm not Old Man! I'm Heaven's Blade! No one in the world can chain down Heaven's Blade! I chained myself here. Why did you chain yourself at the entrance to the Evil Territory? Old Man! Stay away! I can take care of myself! From the beginning oftime, the Heavens and Earth were one. But the Gods and Devils were always at war. Never-ending wars. I have been here for over a century, trying to understand the logic ofthis. But instead, I was invaded by the Evil Force. My strength is depleting fast. That is why I had to chain myself down. There is an evil force lurking in the universe. Because of an equally strong righteous force, it stays in the Evil Territory. This evil force is the basis of all self destruction. Although it stays in the Evil Territory, it masterminds all evil wars and disasters on earth. There will never be peace in the world as long as the Evil Force exists. It is unfortunate that I'm old and can merely stand guard here. If any evil is able to get into the Evil Territory and unite with the Evil Force, the consequences will be too frightening to even ponder. Is there no one who can destroy his Evil Force? The Righteous Force is weakening. Even Li l-Chi and the Twin Swords may not be able to succeed. Li l-Chi? Where is she? Since this is the border between the Good and Evil, the gods have their bases here too. She is in the Cave Beyond to your right. We've finally found her! It is too late! Too late? ls she dead? Of course not. She will outlive all ofyou. What I meant was I did not realize my strength has deteriorated so much. It is only now that I detected a stranger's presence. Teacher! Evil comes from the heart. Gods come from devils. Good and evil are one and the same. May the Evil Force live forever. He wants to get into the Evil Territory! You will have to get passed me, Heaven's Blade, first. I hurt my nose! Let's stop him! Chi Hsi Sword? That's right. Chi-Hsi Sword is a righteous sword, a sword I once knew. The sword is the same, but you have changed. Repent! You are too naive! Naive or not, I must give it a try! The world is already full of evil. I'll not let you into the Evil Territory! You obviously don't know your limits! You still insist? Soldier!! Young man, you have a great potential. Don't worry. I'm here. Heaven's Blade, your strength is almost all gone. You'd better save what's left of your ragged body to live a few more years. My ragged body? The battle between good and evil is a battle ofwills. Wills? Your dying will is no match for my rising strength and power! Are you all right? The magnetic force is very strong over here. Stay away! Get out of here now before it's too late! Soldier...Hold on, don't let go! Soldier...Soldier! Soldier! Watch out! Yi-Chen! Yi-Chen, what are you doing? I've always been a coward. I'm not fit to be the Chief. Here are the beads ofthe Chief. Please return them to Kun-Lun for me. Then what about you? Soldier is now inside. There's still a chance to get him out. I'll go with you! Don't be silly. Ifwe both can't get out, then who will find the Twin Swords? I'll wait for you here! Don't wait. If I make it out alive, I'll look for you. If I don't, there's no use in waiting. Don't hesitate anymore. Go now! Ifwe both die, we're no good for anyone! Go...Go! What are you still waiting for? Soldier! Hurry and save the boy before he's sucked into the Evil Territory! Yi-Chen! Soldier! Grab the beads. Grab it! Soldier, don't worry. We're safe now. But how do we get out of here? I'll use my last breath to send you out. Hold fast onto the chain. Heaven's Blade sacrificed his life for us. Soldier. Soldier...Come out ofthere. I don't know how to swim. I can't save you! Soldier! Soldier... Soldier... Soldier, we got out ofthe Evil Territory. We're safe now. Soldier are you alright? Soldier...Wake up! Soldier... Answer me! The Purple Sword? The Green Sword? Soldier, did you see that? It's the Twin Swords! Look! And there's someone over there! Li l-Chi? That's me. Hooray! We've... We've found Li l-Chi! Hey, what's happened to you? You too! Lady Li. I know all about Long Brows. You two have come this far. Heroes are born in every generation. The two ofyou will be the next owners ofthe Twin Swords. Thank you, Lady Li. The Twin Swords were cast out of stones from heaven and earth, the universe. They absorbed centuries of Universal Force. The swords are employed by men. And men are controlled by their hearts. When these forces unite, the Swords are invincible. But the two swords must not touch one another or destruction will take place. The swordsman may die and the world may be completely devastated. But the Twin Swords are also most powerful when they unite. So it's damned ifyou do and damned ifyou don't. This is part ofthe puzzle I have failed to solve. I wonder if Long Brows has deciphered it! Long Brows. they have found the Twin Swords! Wow! Why am I sharing Li l-Chi's thoughts? Long Brows, when can the Twin Swords touch one another? It is only safe for the two swords to touch each other when the two swordsmen share the same mind. The Big Dipper is shifting and my Sky Mirror will soon lose its power. What does it mean by sharing the same mind? It is when two act in unison. They think and talk simultaneously. The swords are employed by men and the men are controlled by their minds. When the minds are in unison, the two swords become one. So two minds in unison is the key? Heaven and Earth become one Universe? Purple Sword as Heaven, Green Sword as Earth. Purple and Green unite. Heaven and Earth in unison. Lady Li... Lady Li... Teacher. The two ofyou don't have to worry. Did you do this? No... It's me. I have united the three of us into one. Are we still men? Of course. You don't have to worry. To unite Heaven and Earth, you two must be in unison. You can achieve this through my essence. It is time for me to pass the baton to the next generation. The Big Dipper will soon begin to shift. Set off immediately to kill the Blood Demon and rescue Long Brows. Yes, Teacher. Listen up, soldiers of East Zu! This time we won't let you get away. We want you all dead. Soldiers ofWest Zu. Last time we lured you to San-Chang Creek. But you cowards never showed up! Oh no, the stars have started shifting! Stop fighting! Take a look above you! Did you hear me? West Zu, we'll fight you to the end! Where is our Commander? How do we do battle without a Commander? Your Commanders are up here! How did the Commanders get up there? The devil is coming! You must get out before it is too late! What is the girl talking about? Look over there! Be careful not to get sucked in! Yi-Chen, what kind ofwitchcraft is this? Quickly, follow me! Let's follow our Commander. We can't keep up. They're flying too fast! It's Ting-Yin! He's trying to stop us! I know. Oh no, he has our swords locked in! Yi-Chen, watch out! Soldier! You cannot fight with Evil! Yi-Chen! Why is it dark all of a sudden? The Blood Demon absorbs the rays. Hold on! I won't let you egress. There will be no eclipse! What is going on? Man, you are crushing me! I'm being crushed myself! Why aren't the Twin Swords here yet? Don't push me! It's not me. It's an earthquake! Don't fall offthe cliff! Hold on. I can't hold on. I can't even stand! Don't push me! Hold on to one another and you won't all fall off! Hold on! otherwise you will fall down. You guys are too heavy down there. Don't pull my leg. Don't let him lock our swords! I know. Let's turn our swords into shields! You cannot fight Evil! Soldier...Soldier, where are you? Yi-Chen, I'm over here! Yi-Chen, are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine too. I can't see Ting-Yin, but he must be somewhere between us. To win, we must ambush him from both sides. I don't even know where you are, how do we fight? Our minds are in unison. We'll find each other. Really? Time is running out. Unite the Twin words! Okay! Trying to unite? Yi-Chen, he's trying to exhaust our energies. Ifyou try to unite the Twin Swords, your minds must be in unison. Otherwise, as the swords touch, both you and the swords will be destroyed. Don't be distracted at the last critical moment! Concentrate! Unite the swords now! I can't hold it much longer! Yi-Chen, you got distracted and almost destroyed the swords. Soldier, I understand. Let's do it now! Right! We're blocked again! The Doomsday ofthe Righteous has arrived! I can't do this anymore. It's over! The Blood Demon egresses! I don't want to see this! Ting-Yin, you have fallen too deep. There is nothing either one of us can do. We shall be together in another world. It's a fine line between good and evil. The Countess sacrificed herself for the sake ofthe world. That is admirable indeed! Quick, unite now! This time you're really finished! What's that? Something's flying! It's three people! Greetings to Long Brows. The world really belongs to the next generation! Here I go. Chubby, even though we are apart, our minds are together. I hope by the time I give you back this water bottle, all minds are in unison, all wars have ended, and the world is at peace. Then everyone will live happily ever after.
