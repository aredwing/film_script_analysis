Does it surprise you? When you said you'd think about it, I supposed it to be a polite refusal. I long since don't do commisioned works. It's odd that you remembered exactly me. You could've easily got someone from ??? All of this is uncongenial to me. I remember your early works. Such stylistics seem appropriate here. Your work will bring joy and solace to homeless people who ?????. And this plot is appropriate here. Don't explain why exactly do you need Annunciation. I don't care. Pardon me, Father. Anyway, your proposal is something. You see I'm here. But I don't do anything if I'm not interested. I am taking your commission, Father. By the way, not so bad a flowers grow in your gardens. I think that's what I need. Her name is Vita. If I understand correctly, you want to paint her. Father, I really need a sitter. I hope she will agree to sit for me. Vita would hardly refuse to me. Moreover, matter is good. So you'll send her to me? I don't see any other model. Well...I have no objections. Though, I don't really see Vita in this character... You are no painter! You will see what I have noticed in her. Well, what are we doing in evening? I don't know yet. There are much homework today. Let's reserve a table at the bar. They play good country music there. We could dance without getting deaf. Vita! You know, wait a little for me. I will be free in a moment. Right? Let me introduce you. Albert, the painter. Master wants to paint you. Me? Yes. He needs you for Virgin Mary. I hope your work will adorn sanctuary on Ascension Day. I am expecting you in my studio. Tomorrow. Vita, I've got books for you. You can study in my room. Can I come in? I am probably too early. You're right on time. Your name is Vita? Yes. Have a look around. Model has to feel herself at home during work, not peek about. Let girl pour us wine. Look by the mirror. Glasses are also there. Have some yourself. Don't listen to her, Vita. Virgin Mary must be pure, not lecherous. Here you go. Step away! That's dangerous! Better have a look at my works. And remeber - here you can do only what I allow you to do. What is that? What has frightened you? They are devouring each other. Be careful. He was bittnen by she-spider. Bite of she-spider is no more dangerous than that of a woman. Albert, we're leaving. Well? What do you say? That's how I worked in youth. Rubbish! But I like them a lot. Sit down! And now listen... From now on you're at my mercy. Everybody, who comes in here, belongs to me. You will be listening only to me. From now on you are bound the be with me forever. Haven't I scared you? That's nice. Keep in mind, girlie... you don't need to be afraid of anything here. But, bloody hell, what is this hairdo? Can Virgin Mary really have such hairdo? Wonderful... You will be like I see you. But [you must] know our looks are deceptive. They hide the soul. And soul is great mystery. We strive to unravel soul of somebody else and protect our own...from external evil. There are only you and me... this space...and what's in store for us... Back! In your place! I'm scared. I already told you: don't be afraid of anything. Don't be afraid of me. Let me go! Don't be scared... Let me go! No! Let me go! Our looks are deceptive. They hide the soul. And soul is great mystery. Great mystery... I'm speaking. You must return. You belong to me until the work is finished. Vita! I hear you are home. Come to dinner! Where were you so long? With girls. In caffe. Is that true? Who did call you just now? Vita? Why are you keeping silent? What does all this mean? What is happening with you? You don't want to talk to me? Vita? Daughter... We have always understood each other. There are just two of us. Do you know what I have dreamt many times? That...there are three of us. Understand? Yes. There are three of us. And all this repeated with every dream. But who was the third? He's always hiding his eyes. I can not make him out. Vita! What happened to your lips? Answer me. I just...I guess I'm not a kid. I'm speaking. It's me. ...you? Good evening, Mrs. ???? Your call... ...don't talk like that. You know how I feel about your daugher. I am grateful for that. Something is going on with her. ...believe me, it's normal in her age... Believe me, Vita will soon get over this. But if it upsets you so much, I will talk to her tomorrow. Thank you. Is there somehting else troubling you? I didn't tell you everything, Father. Dear God... I protected her so. Is it really all in vain? Calm down. I think your fears are exaggerated. Your daughter is a good christian and I am sure.... .....remember yourself in her age. Trust me... Vita! Vita! Vita! What's going on? Vita, open up! Vita, what's up with you? What was that noise? What did frighten you? Can I help you? I don't need anybody's help, Father. I don't need anybody's help, Father. I don't need anybody's help... I don't need anybody's help... Bear it. Enough. What a strange thing. It's all on acount of your nerves. What is this? That was a spider, mom. What are you twaddling, girlie? I have never heard of spiders biting like that. Nonsense. I am telling you - a spider. You are scaring me, girl. Can I come in? I was just passing by and decided to have a look at the light. Passing by? My light is too far away from your temple, so there's no need for slyness, Father. Well, if you've showed me the honours... Coffee? Yes, with pleasure. Yea...once you saw the world differently. World is changing. We, too. You are mingling causes with consequences, Albert. We are changing and we are deforming the world. And not in the best way. It does not concern you, Father. Each one of us has some guilt. Well, let's drop the subject. To be honest, I wanted to talk to you about Vita. I could not grasp what's up with her. Now much has become clear to me. In short words - I am bound to withdraw my commission. Vita won't be sitting for you anymore. Are you sure? Farewell. Dear friend... I'm listening. How is your work progressing? Your models.... [incomprehensible] ...Vita belongs to me until the work is done. Mom! Mom! Don't worry. Follow my hand. Up. Down. Left. Alright. With what did your fears begin? Close your eyes. Relax yourself. Remember what did you see. I saw a spider. Giant spider. He... Clear. Close your eyes once more. What is in your left hand now? Wait... A star. From glass. Now we will put a star in right hand, too. Are you holding it tight? - I am. Now look. Nothing. So it happens. Now go into that room and undress yourself. Let's have a look at that rash. I don't understand. Yesterday there were strange spots. Real bite. There were no spots yesterday. That's practically no more than a suggestion. Daughter suggested her frights into you. What should we do then, doctor? It would be good for her to change surroundings. To take a rest in nature's lap for a week. Vitochka, you'll visit aunt Magda, live with them on the island... Alright. Vita...Vita! Vita! It's your stop. Vita? Welcome. Yuris. Yes. Aunt Magda wrote that there appeared suddnely a husband and grownup son Yuris in her life. I didn't know you were like this... Like what? Well...cheerful. Pleasant. Everyone in our kin is like that. Both my mom and aunt Magda. You sure? Of course. Welcome. Cool! This is my limo. The thing is almost antique. I restored it myself. It's the most reliable means of transportation. Vitochka... At last. I began to get worried. Jimmy, they're our own people! Jimmy? But you're uncle Aivars? The very same. It's so nice here. I'm glad I came. Well then, welcome... Oh, uncle Aivars... Better simply Aivars. Well, how are you? Is everything fine at home? Yes. Give Vita some rest. You will have time for everything. Yuris, accompany our guest. Shall we go? What a niece you have! It took me whole year to put this room in order. Really? You know, Yuris, I can live anyplace. I'd be glad if you stayed here. It is really nice in here. If it gets cold, we can light the fire. We settle in the castle only during summers and give our little house to renovators. Soon here will be a museum. Is that a walkman? Yes. So that you wouldn't get bored. But the records are old. Oh, if I knew I had taken mine... Well, listen to mine. I'll get some water. Alright. I will change my clothes. Yuris... What's up? It appeared to me...some shadows on the wall... Oh, that...that's just games of light. Peculiarity of man who built this castle. Optical effects. Like shadow theatre? Something of that sort. When I was sick as a child, father enterntained me showing various things on the wall. For example, this. Well, all of that is nonsense. Do you want to look at our island from above? With knobs on! Let's go. Were to? Here? No. That is my room. I will show it to you later. And what is in here? Abandoned ??? You shouldn't go in there. I shouldn't? Right. Nobody should. Oh, how high! Well, from here one can see almost whole island. Once these lands belonged to archbishop, there were some villages, forge, even a fleet. In which side the sea is? There. Behind the trees. You can't see it from here. Yuris, who is that? That's chief executioner of our palace. He's deaf-mute. Tell me the truth. He looked so wildly at me. You know...you'd better not meet him. Anyway, keep away from this place. What's in here? Entrance to the tower. How dark... Are you afraid? I'm not afraid of anything. Jimmy? Calm down. Let's go. Good morning! Is everybody already up? And long since had breakfast. Sit down. Why are you standing? How was your sleep? I don't even remember! It's simply marvelous here. Yuris promised to show me everything here is. What's here to look at? Threes, rocks, well, the sea. Thanks. I don't know when we'll be back. Yuris... Yuris? Yuris! You scared me! But you said you were not afraid of anything... Forgive me. Do you have ghosts here? I don't know. There haven't been any. Maybe there is now. Honestly, Yuris, there must be. At least one. Alright, I'll tell you a secret. There showed up a ghost: pleasant, ginger and horribly tricky... So observable? Sure. I can even tell what are you thinking about. Or I shouldn't? Better not. Should I tell the legend of our castle? Go on. More accurately, about that abandoned room you shouldn't go in. Baron's young daugher once lived in it... Jimmy, let's go swimming! Aivars... What? What are you doing here? I...got so scared. Don't be afraid of anybody here. Okay. You have a nice bathhouse here. Do you like to take steam-baths? I don't know. What a shame that I am an old man, otherwise I'd show you... Aivars, who's an old man? I wouln't tell you are father of Yuris. You are young. Be careful, Vita, I could believe you. When will you stoke it? When? [I could do it] even tomorrow. Cool! It's just we have this custom for men... It's probably boring here for you, city lady. No, what are you saying. Rural life... On the contrary... Aivars, it looks like there's a polecat visiting our henhouse. Something has bitten off hen's head. Yuris, you should set a trap. It must be somewhere there. Hello. You were told! What did I do so wrong? For Christ's sake! Hallo! Good day, Father. This is Magda. Vita is staying with us... Yes. Is something wrong? I think you should come here. Well...thank you... What happened? Vita... What happened with you? Where's Jimmy? I don't know. I think he ran to the woods. Weird. Vanished into thin air. There... Here you are. Jimmy. Where does so much of this filth come from? ??????? What's up with you? Let's leave. I'd like to know what's going on here. Are you having insomnia, too? It's real cave in here. I brought your walkman. You want to listen to some music? Put it down. I...didn't know you smoked. I didn't know many things about you either. What are you talking about? Nothing. You are so funny now. Why? I didn't come to argue with you. Why then? Just don't think that I... There is somebody in that room. I hear steps. I'm probably a yellow-bely after all. Right? Okay. Let's have a look. Just keep quiet. Good morning! Hello! Are you stoking the bathhouse? So it will be possible to bath soon? In the evening. So long? Rocks must heat up. I will have a look at what's up there. Okay? Just don't fall. Yuris, will you be stoking till the very evening? If you don't stoke, you can't take a steam-bath. I will steal you for a moment anyway. It turns out the world really is small. What a nice surprise, Father! You're flattering me, mister painter. Our encounter is hardly a pleasure for you. Let's presume it. So what? As far as I understand a guardian angel for my model has come. Listen, leave the girl alone! You will get her back only when my intention will be fulfilled. Either you leave immediately, or I am taking Vita away this very day. Don't you concede I could be in love with my model? Albert, love doesn't think evil. Both evil and good are threads in a spiderweb. Curious. Untie them and there's neither good, nor evil. I won't allow you to tempt fragile soul. Are you ready to fight me, Father? Do you still believe the man whom you commisioned is standing in front of you? I believe in Creator of this world... There is nothing definite in His world, all is unsettled and uncertain. In the game of light and shadow it is easy [to take false for real] How's bathhouse today? - Good. Dinner's on the table. Don't wait for me and Vita. Is that steam-bathing? How should it be done? Lie down. I will show you. Enough? Probaly. Well, do you like rural bath-house? It's good. Do you hear footsteps? Don't dream. Okay, I'm going. I will stay some while. Alright, just don't be long. Anyway, cramp the door so that wind wouldn't blow it open. Alrigh! Let her go! Vita, run! Shall we go? Wait.
