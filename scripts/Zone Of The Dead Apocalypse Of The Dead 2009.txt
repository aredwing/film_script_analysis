About an hour ago two workmen digging the foundations for the IT Center found four bodies in a very advanced state of decomposition... It seems that the site the workmen were digging at was an old Turkish graveyard. Those skeletons are three hundred years old. Apparently they died from the plague. Thas why they're covered in lime. But thas not the interesting part... The bodies are not sufficiently Decomposed for their age. Let me show you... One of the men cut himself on the skeleton's ribs. An ordinary cut, or so it seemed... But then, by the time the medical staff arrived he was already dead. From the plague!? We still don't know. I want all the skeletons vacuum-sealed, as well as this body here. I'll inform you later about where to send them. And keep quiet on this. Not a word. So you weren't sent to the exercise? I guess they had to leave someone in the city, grandpa. I ain't your gandpa, sonny. C'mon gandpa, relax. They called from the Chemistry department, they'll be here in a couple of minutes... Can't wait... Umm excuse me, can I just ask you... The train from Romania... is running late, isn't it? It just passed through... You didn't see? What do you mean... passed through? The trains are not stopping today... You know - this big military exercise, and- You didn't see the sign at the entrance? I have to make a phonecall... Cell phones aren't working... because of this military exercise. Come this way... I'll let you use a phone. Watch out... The tanker's on is way. The station's closed and... Here... use this phone... The exercises our army is carrying out in cooperation with the NATO forces during this night are planned to Dial nine first. Continue into the morning, with a demonstration of techniques for release of hostages from the hands of terrorist groups Hey, fellas, is ilegal to cross the tracks, is dangerous... Where you headed? No worries, bro... This stupid exercise took so long, we figured... Why wait for morning when we can have a little fun before the MP finds us... An' we wanted to... show our... American friend how we party here in Serbia... Here comes the spook... Agent Milius. Thas him? Prisoner 611... Thas your man. Why is he in a solitary confinement? Has he caused any problems? Thas the way it is. Well get him ready. You're leaving! I hear you. I said you're leaving! I said - I can hear you! Don't move! So they've sent such sweet things to get me? You're not gonna shoot me... There are enforced police troops outside this building. Do you really think you can run away? It was just my way to say thanks... for their hospitality. Still nothing? I have to call my wife, She's gonna wait the whole night at the station, and I won't turn up... She'll call the police... Women... they always assume the worst... Cmon fellas, move along! Don't you "move along" to me, You know which unit I am in? And this is an American citizen here! I always shit my pants when I see you, scientist people. Whas this? Where's the security? Don't you go complaining to me... You want to spend the night at the station... Yo, don't you threaten me, you know who I am? Do you know who I am? Whoa, easy... Wassa matter, chicken? Where's your courage now? Stop joking! Give the gun back! Thas loaded! Masks! Help! Somebody help me! Help! The GPS is definitely not working. Thats because of military exercises... Probably... We should probably... Since the GPS is down, just use this map. You ok? Yes. So... We're here... in Vrsac... We just take this road That leads through Pancevo right into Belgrade. Concentrate... They're late... Agent Reyes is never late... Reyes!? I thought we were going to be accompanied by some local cop... No. Mortimer Reyes. Upon direct request from Headquarters. You don't know who he is? He's a living legend... Hes from Texas. Ex-CIA. Crossed over into Interpol twenty years ago, when he married and took residence in Serbia. I brought you breakfast. You mean dinner. No, I mean sarma. Everything is packed. We'll have to eat out of that. We have almost five minutes to eat everything... Dig in. When does the van come for the stuff? In the morning. The Interpol asked for the two us, Morty... Yes... One more case before I retire... and it all finishes before twelve noon... I can't be late, I wanna get out of here on time. You've pulled this thing All together perfectly? Yes, of course... All planned... The shrink down at the station calls me a Control Freak. Dra, so many... years... So many... memories... I'm sorry that you're leaving... Everything here reminds me of her. I know. I understand. We've been through so much together... Now is time to say goodbye... Somebody, pick up the phone... The poison's gone... I was very worried about you. You know, everybody outside is colapsed. The phone lines are still down, I can't get the ambulance, I can't get the police... I don't get you, Jan... You're being paid by CNN to cover a story about the most polluted city in Europe... And instead of that you're getting drunk at this party... I sobered right up when I saw smoke from the balcony It was coming from the station. Lets go, handsome. Hey, where are you goin'? I'm taking Jan to the station. I'll be back soon. Can I come with you, please? Pleeeease... this place just really... sucks. Alright, just... don't talk too much. Sure. What are you doing outside? You know you shouldn't leave... your cell until the demons inside you leave. The door was open. There was noone. You'd better go back. I've been attacked by a man... Sister, is this the DAY? Blessed is he who readeth and heareth the words of this prophecy and keepeth those things which are written in it. For the time is at hand. For the great day of their wrath is come. And who shall be able to stand? You're late. No, you're early. Your name? Petrovic, Sir. Petrovic? All right, Petrovic... We're on time, aren't we? Of course, Sir. Thas what I thought. Mina Millius. Is really nice to meet you. I've read your file... Is incredible... I'm impressed. But the most interesting parts arent in the file. This is Inspector Belic. Inspector Belic... Call me Dragan. Dragon? No, just Dragan. This assignment is simple. All we have to do is escort the prisoner to Belgrade; from there we'll transport him by plane to London. I know. I've been checking the route whole day, but the GPS hasn't been working... We expected that, didn't we? Everything is fine. If there ever was an easy assignment this is it. Well be done in a couple of hours. Of course, sir... Relax. This is your operation, we're here only as supervisors. Thas what makes me nervous. You've met agent Petrovic. Yes, I met Petrovic. Agent Bottin. Agent Savini is in the van. All right. Mina, come... You'll be fine. All right, les go. Mister President, I was looking for you in your office. I'm here. These place. Brings me peace, relaxes me. Everything is running according to plan. Colonel Ironside stated that, I quote: In the first two days of the military maneuvres, the Serbian Army has demonstrated capacities and capabilities equal to those of modern military powers worldwide;' Thas good. I'm expecting a visit. The Chief of Bureau. Really? At this hour? I haven't received anything from Protocol, and- Informal conversation. An honest chat between old acquaintances. I suppose that such conversations. Aren't bound by constraints of time, or place... So, first time in the field? It shows that much, huh? Not quite. I read your file too. You come highly recommended by the Academy. With a lap-top in my hands I'm unstoppable. But with a gun... we'll see. Mina... You wanna to know something, I"ve been on this job for over 20 years. In all that time, I"ve only had to take my gun out of the holster twice. Just twice. And both of those times on assignments with me... I'm your jinx, Mortimer... Dre, if you say third time's the charm, you will have eaten your last bowl of sarma! Who's the prisoner? And why are we moving him in the dead of night? Actually, the file is very unclear. Agent Reyes, you know anything more about the prisoner? That data is strictly classified. Your task is merely to get him to London, alive and well, and we're here to help you. Petrovic? You've been quiet since we started off? Maybe I just don't like the fact that the mission is being run by a green rookie! Are we there? We're not there... it just choked. Stupid YUGO! We don't have gas, or what? No... I don't know. Is just dead. What happend? These guys left the party also... Jan... Finally! How far is that station? Can we walk there? Jan... look... Save me! Jesus saves! Run! They've gone mad! Everyone thought I was mad... I wasn't allowed to leave the cell but now... Now! We have to run. Run!? This is how end of days begins, this is the beginning of Armageddon! Cut off the serpens head And the body will die. Save me! Get me out of here. Please, take me with you. Start the car, start the car! Come on! The key. Everybody out! You! Stay away. I'm not one of them. This is a nightmare. I shouldn't take those mushrooms in the kitchen. Mr. President, The Chief of Bureau is here. I thought that at this time of night you'd be sleeping. I didn't think you'd respond to my call tonight. Really? How could I refuse? After all, you are the President. Tell me, Operation Black Smoke? What is it? Black Smoke is an operation Which has been running for decades. Twenty or so years ago, we encountered a very unusual phenomenon near the industrial zone in Pancevo, on the bones of ancient plague victims... What!? It turned out that the plague Virus develops an interesting trait when soaked in sufficient quantities of ammonia and benzene. I'm not a chemist so I cannot give you a precise explanation... Essentially - it brings Dead cells to life! Our Services had great benefits from those chemicals. Civil wars in Africa, the Middle East conflicts... we were supplying for everyone. Cancel the whole thing at once! Is too late. Two hours ago we have lost contact with the train that was transporting it. It seems there have been an accident... The chemical was released into the atmosphere... We must... we must evacuate the city! Certainly not. Tomorrow morning when the NATO exercises are over, our special forces will cover up the incident, using the Chernobyl template. And the inhabitants of Pancevo? Collateral damage. Welcome to Pancevo. Why are you closing the window? Because of the stench. They don't even need a Welcome board. When it starts to stink, you know you're in Pancevo. And so, on the most routine of missions you get to pass through the most toxic city in all of Europe. Not quite what you expected? Wanna hear the funny part? People say that in these parts- Damn... He's dead. Mina, tell Savini to wait for us at the next set of lights. Yes, Sir! Petrovic, contact the local police. Yes, Sir! Mortimer? Yes? Look... Please don't let this be - third time's the charm. Mina, stay in the car. The lap top really isn't doing me much good right now. Watch the perimeter. Petrovic, have you reached the locals? No response. Just static. Mina, call Savini Tell them to get back here right now. Yes Sir. You hear that? I hear it... Thas close enough Agent Reyes, Savini and Bottin aren't answering Mina, get back in the car, now, move it! Morty, les go!!! Morty! Les move! Move! Mina? I'm fine, I'm fine... Les go! Petrovic, try reaching anyone, You understand? Anyone! Local police, school croosing guard, I don't give a damn who. Find somebody! - Yes Sir. Agent Savini! Agent Bottin! Bottin! Savini's dead, Dra. Agent Reyes, what about the prisoner? The van is out of commission. We'll have to transfer him to our car. I have a clear line of fire! I've found Bottin. Agent Reyes, are you ok? I'm fine... Dra! We have to get out of here. Right now! Hey, we've run into some unforeseen circumstances and we'll have to transfer you to another vehicle. Don't do anything stupid, alright? He's heard you. Open it! Aim for the head. What? I said, aim for the heads. He's right. He's not moving. Alright, les go! So you've started without me? Get down! Easy now, easy. We'll just get to the car and then we move on. Move on? Looks like the end of the line to me. They're all over the place. What happened to them? We need to move faster. I'd love to, but these new shoes give me a terrible blister. Is this some sort of war? War of the Worlds. What should we do, Mortimer? I think we should find a local police station or something. Establish communication links and wait for back-up. The closest police station is nearby, behind the park. Petrovic, get back into the car and start the engine! Move! Move! Move! C'mon! This one seems agile... A primary victim. Where'd he go? Shoot him in the head. Shut up! Shut your mouth! I said shoot him in the head! Shut up!! Want him to become like those two we left back there? Petrovic! Do you hear me? Petrovic's gone. Petrovic! Adios, Petrovic... Mina, watch him! The tire is flat. We'll have to walk. The Station is that way, behind the park. Is not far. Mortimer, release him. What? Release him! Fast! Mina. We've hardly met, and already so intimate. And how about we just lave you here? Agent Millius! How you feel about that? You should have come in a cheerleader uniform. Mina... Why don't you give me a gun or something? My aim is very good. I'll bet. The building is right there. Get her off me! Get her off me! Eat this! Give me back my gun. Give her back her weapon. Thas my thanks? Thanks. Now give me back my gun. Did He bite you? Now you become like one of them. Feel free to pretend you don't see whas going on. We have no time for this. Pull one more stunt like That and I'll mess up that ironic smile of yours for good. Les go! Go, Dra! It seems like we missed the party. You alright? Lines are dead. Can you contact the base in Belgrade by the network? Yes, the system doesn't look like is damaged. But there's no power. So we'll have to find a generator somewhere... We'll do. The wound has gone numb, hasn't it? The speed of the transformation depends on the severity of the bite. And how do you know all that? Les say I just have a great instinct. We'll find some sort of first aid kit. Here's something. Where did everybody go? Probably out handling the riots. Eaten, infected, or probably both. You speak only when spoken to, clear? Or what? You gonna ruin my smile? You can bet your life on it! How'd you feel? Like crap. Inspector Belic and I will check the rest of the premises. If he moves, kill him. They've stopped banging. Do you really think they quit? No... Crap... To meet like this. OK, don't move and shut your mouth. They took everything. Theres no ammo too. This is bad. I've got two more clips. You? One. We'll have to economize. Detention. FREEZE!! You are sane! And you, are you sane? Anyone hurt? No, we're all fine, but the gentleman behind the bars He asked us to lock him in. Sir... I'm a professor... Les go. Today... I used to work at the library... Now... is all gone... All those books... the knowlege of dead civilisations... Everything will be fine, Sir. We're with the police. I'm going to open the door. We're going back. We'll find a place where we will be safe. My wife. I didn't manage to tell her not to wait for me. C'mon. Les go. More survivors. Great. I am agent Milius. Was he any trouble? If he had been he wouldn't still be sitting there. Pay no attention. She just can't resist my boyish charm. When I got away from the station. I ran into some weird soldier. He was shouting how armageddon is coming and how he's been preparing for years It looks as he was right. Rats from the trash! I'll send you back to whence you came. Now les see, this Prophet of the Lord which tool shall he reach for next... The flaming strength of the Lord!! His Will be done... The generator room is down this corridor. I have to wash this. No water for me? I saved your life, back there in the park. I was hoping for a bit more recognition. I said thank you. I can't believe that my camera fell just like that. I can't believe that in The middle of this horror you're thinking about your camera. This is probably the worst thing that ever happened since the begining of civilized world! And I'm a part of it and I don't have a cam! Is't that shit just great? What is it now? Are you angree? Well no, never mind. I'm worried about Jovana. Why do you worry about me? Somehow you showed certain promise at the very beginning. But it doesn't take too long to see through it. Fear. You smell of fear. Well you smell of sweat. So, this is your first case? Hell of an initiation, huh? Look, just keep quiet, I'll get you glass of water. I've been quiet for too long. Illegally imprisoned without a shred of proof. And now as I'm going through this city suddenly this crap? What are you playing at? You want me to believe that you're so important someone stage this whole thing out of spite towards you? No. I am just a stranger in a strange land. Been that all my life. You talk too much. What... crap... The jerk... was right... How do you feel? The bite hurts. And the whole left side, all numb. We have to get to the generator, Dra. Put that bandage back and les go. I appreciate the fact that you're trying to get my mind off of this, and all, But, Morty, I won't be going with you... I thought you quit that. I tried. But is all That keeps me sane. Haunts you again? More than ever. More than ever, Dra... I'm so sorry. We"ll talk about this later, this is not the time, Draa. I know... C'mon... Is he ok? Why don't you find a rope and tie him down. He hasn't got far to go. One more word out of you and... - Mina! Listen, people, if he's been infected why don't we shoot him right now? Shoot him! Enough! I didn't see that one coming. Agent Reyes, what are you doing? We have to re-start the generator. Belic's injuries are too severe. If I take you, I've no one to look after him. This way I watch him. I thought cops had better things to do than to become heroes. Currently, currently nothing better occurs to me. This ain't the wild wild west. Why don't you take a look outside. Mina, watch Belic. He's getting worse. You know what to do if he starts turning into... No, agent Reyes, I... This is a direct order, agent Millius. And we always obey orders. Yes, sir! Alright, les go! You, follow me. I'm just a reporter... I'm not interested. Get up! As soon as we go down, look this door, understand? OK. It looks deserted. Are you sure the generator Is down there? I saw the blueprints of the building. OK, here goes. So whas to stop me shooting you right in the back and get the hell out of here? You're not stupid. You know that together we got better chances of lasting through the night. In situations like this one, you're just slowing me down. OK then. If you try anything, I'll kill you and not by a bullet to the brain, but straight through your heart, so you can come back like one of these things outside. The man is an artist. Art has nothing to do with it. I just don't like you! Cat. What? Is always a cat. Siamese? The brain. If the brain is intact, the infected is not destroyed. How do you know all that? Chernobyl, 1986. Really? And you were there then? How old were you, five? Not me. My father... Les find the damned generator and get the hell out of here. Thanks. How are you feeling? Never better. Why don't I get you some water? Listen. You're just starting out in this job. Please just don't talk, relax. Just one thing. This job can possess a man, it can become an obsession don't let it happen to you what happened to Reyes. What happened to Reyes? A stuppid accident that ruined his life. The stupid obsession that made him go away on that day instead of taking his wife. She went by herself by train and sliped She fell onto the train tracks... Don't let this job obsess you so much don't let it control your life. Don't let it destroy A bullet to the head now. Please, Mina, please. A bullet, Mina, please. I'm sorry. Is getting hot here... Quiet... Here it is... You see this one. Is The only main switch. Is gonna turn all on automatically. Les try this way. Nothing happened. What are you doin'? Sometimes you've just got to give it a kick. I see. It seems some of your collegues had the same idea. Behind it is the street. Quickly. Back! Move! Only three clips left! We go for the door, we don't care about the rest of them. Clear? Move it!! Well you're free now! You owe me one. Open the door!! Open the god damn door! Open the door, or I'll shoot through it! There are loads of them. We are going to die!! We are going to die! - Get the chair! Leave it! Leave it! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. He was... You did what you had to do. Ok? Understand? Hold the door! We need to check the network. Put me through to Colonel Ironside. Now. The system is functional, But the external link doesn't work. Is almost as if is been shut down by central. At least we've got cable. Thats just TV Pancevo. Wait, wait, hold on. This is live. Look!! Did you see that? In that park I kissed for the first time And hell and death were cast into the pool of fire. This is the second death. Don't! Can you operate the machinery? Is time we announced to the world whas happening out there, you understand? This is no good... Why don't you put a Cartoon Channel or something? Look... C'mon old man, how hard can it be? Lucifer invented those demonic machines so that everyone can use them! Thas him. That lunatic. You know, Jan, when all this ends you should make an interview with him... I don't think I'll come back here ever again. Brothers and sisters... Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath! In those days, men shall seek death and shall not find it. And they shall desire to die and death shall fly from them. Could you please turn it down? And I saw a city chained in concrete and iron, and I saw a city lapped by dark waters. And I saw a way to repent ourselves! A way to destroy the old serpent. To redeem our sins against a planet that we have turned into our plaything! To pay for the filth and toxic stench with which we have filled our seas and oceans, the jungles and forests we have slain through our haughty carelesness and gross neglect... Please turn it down a bit. You kill the serpent in the head! Fire at their heads! Blow apart their heads! Is the only way! Let me OUT! Stop her! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Calm down, calm down! They've breached it! We have to get back! Everyone get out of here. Get back into the other room! What a bad trip Go!! Go!! We've held them back. But we have a minute or two at most. Jovana... Les move. Here's the way out! This window leads out into a side street. I've checked, there aren't any of them out here! Professor? You go... Professor, if you stay... I know, but you heard the man. The end of the world is coming. Our civilisation... Les go!! We've been wathcing its decline for decades and now the end is upon us and is all our own fault, our own fault. Your wife. She's still waiting for you. My wife? But she's dead. She died ten days ago. I somehow forgot. I somehow forgot. Agent Reyes, c'mon! Once again, professor. Are you coming with us? There are far more horrifying Things than what is happening to us now. To die, and come back. This loathsome wandering... to us now. To die, and come back. This loathsome wandering... without ever having known what it is to love and be loved. Is dawn already. Is dawn already. It looks safe here. So, what"s the plan? I think the only smart thing Is to try to reach the river, steal a boat and reach Belgrade. Wait, people. Maybe we should find some shopping mall? It would be too hard to secure, and, believe me - they would get in anyway! And, believe me - they would get in anyway! I think the river's a better plan. Beats a shopping mall, definitely. Agent Reyes, what about your weapon? I have nothing. Mina, how many shots left in yours? What ever is left in the clip. Three maybe. You? Empty! Empty! We have enough time to get out of the city before the authorities contain the outbreak. How do you mean? I mean Chernobyl. I mean Chernobyl. The nuclear catastrophe was a conscious decision. It was the only way to stop the contagion. What do you mean? You were there? My father used to work at the plant... The primary victims killed by the gas come back to life. Secondary victims, slain by the primary ones, also spread Secondary victims, slain by the primary ones, also spread the infection further... And your father? Died. Twice. The river is there. We're close. Look at them. Thas so weird. As if they're all sleeping. You're the expert. What gives? No idea. This never happened at Chernobyl. No idea. This never happened at Chernobyl. They didn't let it go for long enough. Maybe they're trying to get warm. Maybe is too cold when you're dead. Whatever it is, that river is our only ticket out of here. What now, sheriff? Quiet. Quiet. I'm thinking... Quiet. Quiet. I'm thinking... Ok... This is what we do... I'm going down there. If they stay still, perfect. If they rise, I'll try to lure them to the wagon. If they rise, I'll try to lure them to the wagon. As soon as the infected come after me run to the river! Run as if hell itself is chasing you. Clear? I don't think I'm gonna Like this plan... You don't want me along? You don't want me along? This is agent Milius's first field case. It would be a shame if she were not to complete it successfully, wouldn't it? Ok... here goes... When I was a little boy, There use to be this crazy man That use to run through the Neighbourhood and rat and rave. He would say weird things. One of the things he used to say That ticks in my mind every time I look at this. That ticks in my mind every time I look at this. He would say - Hell is going to overflow and the dead will rise forever! Crazy old man? Here goes... He stopped... Oh, shit! Wait for my signal. Thas our breach! C'mon, go! C'mon, les go! OK. We gotta go faster! You guys, get down to the river! Start the engine and wait! I am going to get Reyes! Start the engine and wait! I am going to get Reyes! Disobeying a direct order? C'mon. Go... And miss all that fun? Les go! Les go! Undo the ropes! I'll get the engine starting, so we don't waste any time. C'mon! Jan? Help me up. I ain't waiting for nobody! Smells like the End of Days! Come to me, children of darkness, the time of Redemption is nigh! The time of Redemption is nigh! He's the only chance we have! This way! I've plenty of weapons for all! Let us drive this filth back to whence it emerged! I'm going after Reyes! I'm going after Reyes! We'll both go! Catch!! Die you zombie bastard! These guy's mighty quick. Primary victim... You disobeyed a direct order? I found the instructions unclear. Which part of run and don't stop" did you find lacking in clarity? All of it! The Prisoner? Finish your mission! Yes, Sir! We're going live in five, four, three, two... Citizens of Serbia, a few hours ago I have been informed Citizens of Serbia, a few hours ago I have been informed about the incident in Pancevo. Dangerous, toxic chemicals have been released into the air and have poisoned a large number of inhabitants. Our elite military and police units, in cooperation with our NATO allies, have set up a quarantine zone cooperation with our NATO allies, have set up a quarantine zone perimeter around the entire municipality of Pancevo, and have commenced two hours ago to evacuate surviving citizens. Also. I promise that I will have this incident thoroughly investigated and that I will use all my power and influence to discover which government agencies have been working against the public interest, and to bring all those directly against the public interest, and to bring all those directly responsible before the face of justice. Thank you. Thank you... Mr. President, the Chief of Bureau is asking to see you. Of course. Of course. I heard your speech. I expect to see your resignation. I thought you would be smarter than that. No one can protect you now. Certainly not your NATO friends. No one can protect you now. Certainly not your NATO friends. They're not friends. Merely a necessary evil. I will not rest until all of you are brought to justice. So, you've got two guns, and I have a sword. Who's got better fighting chances? Well, I've got two empty guns. And doubt you're gonna come with me willingly. You know, I keep saying, what a shame that we meet under these circumstances. What a shame that we meet under these circumstances. What a shame I'm Out of ammo. Looks like the first field assignment has to remain uncompleted. Maybe one day we'll meet again. I doubt it. Mina, the prisoner? He got away? Yes. He just disappeared. Of course. Doesn't really matter. My first field assignment was a complete disaster. I'll tell you about it sometime. You certenly have proven your skills with a gun? I guess so. Mina, good job. Thank you, sir. By the way... Honestly, who was the prisoner? Nobody special. And He shall raise with his hands the Sword of Vengeance. The Flaming Blade of the Lors Retribution. And his eyes were as a flame of fire. And he had a name written, which no man knoweth but himself. Damn Serbia.
