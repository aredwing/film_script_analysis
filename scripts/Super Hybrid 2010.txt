Yes, I'm working on it. See you tomorrow. Before you become a millionaire, would be kind enough to organize this pile of crap? The insurance does not cover any missing file during registration, and I will not take the blame. Enough with this talk routine, I understand. Yes? And why has not done so far? You know, I pray that he receives service supervisor at the Imperial. Be careful what you wish for. I have to see an ophthalmologist. The idiot does not know like parking?

I think I lost my necklace, with a medallion, you see? No, sorry, but I can use my skills. Okay, I think I left here yesterday. Hector, where the hell are you? It seems that he will stay here tonight. Hector! Yes, a big improvement. Hector! Hector! Where are you? Hector! Where are you? Hector, come on, all are looking for you. Cute, got me. You can turn off the headlights now. Hector... Come on, wake up, man. -What are you doing, man? Hector-I'm looking for. But Hector is not there. In-car has nothing. -Maybe next time. Just go back. This is the car came this morning? I do not know, ask Hector. Go to the grocery store will not hurt your back. Mary, why does not care about level 3? Well, I gotta go. I ask, but... yes. No, I love you. -I love you too, not that cool? Do not have a lot around here. -Just a second. What I said about using the phone? Okay, I gotta go, bye. You know I can sue you harassment, right? And you know there are rules? Secretaries only have I think it took longer, then will have to do a retreatment. Hey! Level 3? What the hell is going on here? Hey! When you see Hector, have him here immediately. Yes, of course. Listen, I can work David's car tonight? Sure, honey, what you do during your range is your problem. I'm serious. Rides to the sunset and dispatch. -I mean, your sweetheart. -Right. Listen, we have much work to do until morning. All these cars need be removed and cleaned for paint next week. Start by taking inventory with what's left on level 3. -Fast. Yes, sir. -Fast. Yes, sir. As well do not know what kind of car is it? Take a look... Okay, but I must warn you, the last car that could not identify model and year I was 15, was a Coupe Custom 1940. Thank you. That's what I thought. And Tilda told me that there is something very strange about this car. For one thing, Bobby. Enough with this business of her aunt. I'm not old enough to be his aunt. -But you are my aunt. -It does not matter. For those who want to know, 're just cousins, right? -Understood. -What about us? She told us, I obey. There's something in the painting. There seems to metal. It's not fiberglass. Strange. Has no connection. Look. It is a compound. I suppose it's factory. I think it's a 76 or 77. The lines are perfect. -Must be a mistake. Well-thought. I think not. -This is what I said. Yes, it's almost like... Like what? It is as if to show this model for someone and build a copy, but is like making memory because it is... is almost identical to look closely. Who would do something like that? Al, where is Hector? Yes, I would pursue it. -Yes. -I will. -Goodbye, friend. It's still warm. Can not be. They brought him this morning. Nothing? Til? It's not like any engine I have ever heard. It's more like... a hearing... I open to you. -Open the hood? Yes, I will try. -Got it? -Apparently not. Nothing. Okay, you know what? We will bring a ramp here. Let's take it to level 2, suspend it and look better. Al, wait. We are forgetting Hector. -E, Al .. -I can get it for you. -I will take it. No, no, guys. Go up, right? We met there. Do not start again. Okay. Al! Hey, Til, come look at it. What? You changed the car? -No. How so "no"? He just... They just move. Okay, very funny. Let's take it back before that Ray has a tantrum. Al! -Tilda, open, open! -Come on! Al! -Tilda! Help! Al! Help! Help! Al! -Get me out! -I take it, I'll take it! Al! Tilda! Al! Help! Help! Stay here. Help! Help! Hey! Let's see, raise your hands those who think that Hector and Al .. were killed by a car cannibal? -I am not crazy, Ray -You think I'm stupid? Or Al, and Hector... eaten? Come on, guys, probably are in this together. I'm not crazy! Ray, there was something very strange about it. This is the part where the crime looks like it could have attacked and devoured a man, Pointdexter. I want to look at this damn vehicle. Whatever it is. Ray... wait... -Shut up, Tilda! Al-Hector, come here! Ray, do not... listen to me. I did not hear it? Finally something that makes sense. Ray, you need believe me! -Til... Til, no. -Gordy... Tell me this has nothing to do with Lake Forest. -What are you talking about? -Nothing. -Nothing, Sgt. -Talk to me, Gordy. Look, it's complicated, okay? Come on, out with. She had a hard time, okay? First school year. She had to give up. He had panic attacks on people who persecuted him. This explains angry responses. Hey! I'm not crazy. Okay, where is it? Now. What did you do with the car? What the hell was that? Al? Hector? Get out now before I explode inside. One hears the car engine? Because I do not hear the car engine. Ray! Ray Ray, get away from there. Get away now! Tilda, just because you have problems with cars does not mean that we have. Looks like another car. Gordy, get a crowbar toolbox. Let's open the damn hood. Do you think this is a good idea, Ray? Ray! Ray! Just listen. What the hell was that? Okay, Gordy. Go ahead. Go to the stairs. Now! Move! Now! Go! -Tilda! Come on, jump! Hop! Get up! Come on, get up! What the hell are we doing here? -Monsters, how do I know? -God, you were right. Take a medal. How many? -A. He turns. What? Say it again. Changes. It's like a change of form. As one of those robots from space? I do not know where it comes from. Did you see under the hood, I mean... -This thing is not a machine... -It's alive! Where it came from and what the heck does in my garage? I think that's what he does. What? -I studied these things in school, and marine biology was a species of squid. Petrus or Innoculatus something. I mean... may look other things, like a shell, a stone or a piece of coral. A fish comes and goes swimming. She wants to be nice and stay in a hidden place. And then he goes and is... eaten. Yes, as a kind camouflaged giant squid. It looks more like an insectoid. I have no idea... perhaps is a kind of hybrid. Thanks for the scientific analysis, Newton, but... who cares? I think that has been evolving millions of years ago. Ray .. what are you doing? Can is imitating a cave or a mouse on the side of the road. Car may be the ultimate form have taken. Cars can move, not have to wait to eat, they can... they can be true hunters. Is that what you are? A hunter? Take it from me! Hey, hey, it's going away! Nobody saw one of these before, right? How do I know? How will we know if Area 51 does not have an army of them? And if you get one? This is not a their trophy hunts. -That thing killed two people. Hey, do not know that, right? We do not know what happened to Hector. Let's stick to the facts, right? We need help. Let's call the district. Hello, officer? Yes, yes, we are in a garage and have a little problem. It's one of those Pentacocus inoculated or whatever it is, is loose, e. .. well... Oops, the line went dead. Let's say there are the corpse of Hector, under no circumstances will believe us. Is death row or asylum. We can support each other, right? It's a super story, right? A great story. I bet we can get $ 250,000 for it... -This is more than 60 000 each. -50 Thousand. With Maria. Yes, 50 thousand with Maria. -What are you talking about? Let's get this sucker. Who does not want to participate go to the office and help Mary with the crossword. What is the word "eight letters" to "loser"? -This is bullshit! -Working together... -We can get it. -The elevator shaft. We may suspend the elevator car, the well is almost 4 meters deep if forced to go there jailed. Yeah, right. Okay, first thing... let's lock level 2. We will block the ramp here. Let's make a barricade. The hold-here. -Bobby, this is crazy. -It can work. -Gordy! Oh, shit. If that does not stop I'll have another idea, Til. That's it, baby, come on! Come on, come on! Hey, listen. Someone has to stay here to look at the car while we do the barricade. Do you think Bobby can? -I will do that. -That's my girl. Keep an eye on it and ensure do not go up the ramp and replace. This fence can not hold a golf cart. I'll get another one. Keep your eyes open. Mary! Mary! What, Tilda? Mary, call the district asked to send some police immediately. And why do you want I do this? Maria, seriously, this is an emergency! Okay. What kind of emergency? Damn it, Mary. I'm serious. Tilda, we are under terrorist attack? Your hair is on fire? An alien landed on the roof? Mary... -What is. Just so you know. I expected this type nonsense of the guys, but... you, of all others? Mary! Mary! You see, I told you. Damn! Doors... are closed. Please do not. Hey, Tilda, we can do it. -No. If you want to go, all right, I understand. Do not stay here just for me. Fast, the elevator was up. I told we meet down there. We must do whatever it is, enter the elevator shaft. Right. What happened to you? I know what happened to Al All right, Bobby. Come on! That's teamwork. I need you. You can help Gordy to make a barricade. You know, Ray? The main gate is closed. It is to keep addicts away. You will not easy to get rid of this, Ray Jesus! -The fun has not started yet. -This is not funny, Gordy! Come on, you know this is wrong! My God, Tilda. I'll tell you what I know. There are some things Ray learned from the army. There are leaders and followers. And I'm not a leader. Ray is an idiot, okay? Are you going to put us in danger. -Yes... maybe. Why? To hunt this monster? We are mechanical, Gordy, no X-Men, we can not do that. Listen, if things get strange, I'll cover you. We should go. You coming? Hey! Where are you guys? Hello? Bobby... Bobby, be careful! We did it! It's stuck! What's happening? Guys! Hey! That's me! Bobby! Come on! Hey! Hey, it's me! Hey! Somebody help me! Everyone-up now! What the hell is happening? He was behind the Mary! Help! Mary! Mary! Come on out! Come on out! Mary! Come on! -Hold on tight! Hold on tight! -In what? Out of my way! Who is driving that thing? -No! Stop! You'll kill us! Damn! Come! Come, you little shit! Die! -Gordy! -Go down the stairs! Come on! Gordy! Gordy! What was that? -It was a good man. Courageous. -Shut up. Hey! Ray! Ray! Ray! Where's the key? The key? The key is on my desk. -Serve! -Oh, no! Will it help? How long emergency lights? If the batteries were changed as they should, but I do not think the batteries were changed... ever. Okay. So we need to get out of here now! No way out, Bobby. What are you talking about? What the hell? Al did the close and weld two days ago. To prevent break-ins and keep addicts off. Welding an emergency exit? It is an emergency exit, Ray! I did not know we would be arrested here with a killer car! You're so stupid! Come on! Help! Look, we are shaken with what happened. I understand, but I still think we should stick to the plan. -We have a plan? Do not we have more. Yeah, let's take the sucker. -No! -Tilda, I know how you feel. -I will kill him. Can someone tell me what is happening here? You're bleeding. If it can bleed may die. Tilda, you've seen what survived, not be so easy. That's why we have go fast. And if someone comes? The next turn comes only Monday morning not survive this time. Messerschmitt KR200, Citroen 2CV prototype, Mercedes Smart. which are small enough to fit the stairs. All I need is one. Mary. Mary. I'll get us out of here. Trust me, okay? 'Now, listen... -I hear my ass! With all due respect, who put you in charge? Nobody. I'm not. Nobody is in charge. But I'm sure someone is in charge. We are doing this together. Okay? Like it or not, you are not commanding a platoon. Is managing a garage, right? Checking cars preparing schedules. You're not a leader, Ray You're just a bully. It hurts. We still have light. The ramp from Level 3 is blocked, this means we can work there. Come on. Hey, Tilda!? If you are not in charge, as we all are following you? Hey, Ray, if you want to help come with us, Otherwise, stay where you are. -Here. -So why us? Mary, Help the Bobby to put the chain on the ramp. This is how to stop a bull with a chain. You know. You're the hunter. Or purchased their trophies on E-bay. System to warn. Construction is behind schedule. Do you really think this will do any good? I feel better already. Okay. We may not have energy, but while batteries resist We can do more of that. More of that? Why? Ever heard of trap Burmese for tigers? I have. It is a den with sharpened stakes at the bottom, covered to look like that is the floors. Yes, we have seen Discovery Channel. Quick, let's go. Quick! Yeah, come on. Push, is inside.
