The movie you're about to watch "Les Liaisons rotiques", is just a plagiary from the novel "Spring's Suicides", written by our famous French writer Raymond Marlot. This is nothing but a pure product of the triumphantyen made by the Japanese, that nation of hard-working ants, solely for a Japanese audience. Don't get fooled by the fact that the story is set in Paris. Paris is just the setting of the film. I'm convinced the Cannes Festival organisers will refuse to select such a stupid work. Japan is Europe's enemy. I strongly advise all the audience to leave this theatre immediately. President Mitterand is in tears. Long live France, long live France, glory to France, good-bye. What are you damn Japs doing here? That's why I told you we should buy a Japanese car. - How are you? - Good, and you? Two coffee with milk. As usual? Thank you. JAPANESE TOUR GUIDE AND DETECTIVE Alright, I'll be right there. Madam, is it time to wave that flag again? We don't have a choice. This is the only job available right now. That's because of your stupid sign outside. We wouldn't survive without it. You should appreciate me more. Here we are, the Eiffel Tower. Please stay together. Watch your step, please. This way. Everyone, please stay in line. Stay in line please. This way. Hello, Kishin Shimoyama Detective Office. Good day. An investigation? Here, Kishin. - I'm Okuyama, the one who called. - Please come in. Chief is tied up at the moment. Would you wait please? Chief, the client is here. Remember now, act self-important. I see. You believe someone slept with your mistress, and you want me to find some evidence to prove it. Excuse me, how much is this worth to you? No further, we'll do it. Excuse me, this way. Take care. Let me handle this. I'm the bookkeeper. This is payback for your meals, remember? And this is for the rent, water, utilities, books... This is for you. Wait a minute... You said we could go to the disco. Hi, Sandra. - Long time no see, Rie. - I've been busy. Your date? - No, he's my uncle. - Hello, I'm Jon. - Reserve a dance for me later? - Alright. That's terrible, calling me your "uncle. " Would you rather be my "boyfriend?" - Would you like a drink? - Drink? The usual? - I'd like to see a menu. - Okay. By yourself? I'm alone too, and a bit bored. Kishin... Kishin... Wake up! Your breakfast is ready. Come over. Alright. Don't be lazy. It's rare for you to be working. - Don't forget the camera and microphone. - I know. - Some more? - A little bit. If something happens, I'll be at the office all day. I know. Whenever I see a good looking woman, I always imagine... ...her naked, getting out of a bath. - Good day. Is the boss in? - He's not here yet. Sorry, Sir, this is a woman's gym. Not for men, sorry. No men allowed. Good afternoon, Sir. Miss Loren is here. Do not trash the Paris streets. Damn Japs have no manners... - Good afternoon, Sir. Can I help you? - Yes. Coffee with milk. Nice looking tattoo. I know. You don't need to tell me. Fuck you. Leave me the fuck alone. Damn you to hell. What language is that? Moroccan. You speak French, right? Me? I'm not very good at it because I'm Japanese. What a fucking nuisance. This guy is a goddamn jerk. Leave me. Leave me the fuck alone. Do you speak Esperanto? Speak English? What is going on here? Is she fooling around with this old guy too? This mansion is known as the Bourgeoisie Social Club. High society Japanese are spending their money here. It's been a long time. Since I've been gone, you've become more beautiful. Oh, come on now. Hey, the couple who just came in... Do they come here often? Just recently. But they're real party people. Are they outrageous? Especially that woman. What's the matter? Can I use your phone? You forgot the microphone? I reminded you this morning. Where are you right now? - Here. - I'm sorry. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? Two coffee with milk. We've got the evidence. We'll give him the photos and the tape, and pick up the rest of the money. But he wasn't her only lover. Cool. But I can't believe she's really that kind of woman. From her voice, I think she's a passionate woman. You're blinded by pretty women. I think it's Okuyama's fault. You need to make a report to him. But if she's having many affairs, we could charge more. I've decided. I'm going to drop the case. Kishin, do you have feelings for that... She smiled at me, then she winked. When? While I was peeping at her. What are you saying? That woman knew I was spying on her. So you're saying she did everything on purpose? I don't know. That's just your imagination. I don't think so. She smiled atme. That's weird. But we can't afford to drop this job. I will solve the mystery. With your help, of course. The woman winked at the detective hired by her boyfriend. Do you understand what's on her mind? I'm trying to figure it out. I got it. The woman realized you were a detective on her tail. She doesn't want you to disclose her infidelity, so she tried to flirt with you. That could be the right answer. It must be. So now we can expect her counter-offer. Counter-offer? Yes. We'll do business with whoever gives the better offer. You are lucky. You seem to have fallen into a great situation. What should I do? Keep doing what you're doing, and we'll wait until their next move. Yes. Sounds good. Very good. I've been waiting for you. Come in. What took you so long? No, don't say anything. I have something to ask you. I want to talk about something too. You think I'm just a slut, but those are the orders from Okuyama. Okuyama's real business is blackmail. He makes me sleep with rich guys, then he leeches their money away. Could you get hard evidence of his crimes forme? I started working as his secretary. One day he made me sleep with him. I was desperately poor. When I realized how evil he was, it was too late. He used me as atreat for his business associates. I've allowed myself to live like this since then. I knew you were following me. I hoped you were the one who would rescue me. Why me? Because I like you. I can't believe you. I don't blame you. It's a difficult story to believe. But I... I like you. I want you to take me with you. Please take me. If the two of us... go away... We could blackmail him. I could feel my brain shut down. But my heart was telling me, "don't leave this woman. " - Hello. - Hello. - Could you give me the usual? - Of course. Our investigation is going very well. Join me? Well... Where do you buy those kind of clothes? These? The Second Hand Boutique. Second hand? Let's go to a dress shop. Dress? I'm changing right now. Try these. This would match my jeans. Hello, are you alone? Yes. One coffee with milk. Of course. Where are we going? Fashion show. Oh? Which one? I don't know. Thank you very much. Hi there. Where have you been all this time? Who were you with? Do you care? With Mr. Okuyama. What did you say? He said anyone who doesn't pay attention to a pretty girl is stupid. Did Okuyama also buy your dress? These too. What are you doing? It was a wonderful night. He was a true gentleman. What kind of gentleman? He's an asshole. Why? Did you learn something? I need to discuss it. With which one? Explain it to me. How come I have to explain everything to you? What's with the attitude? I have my own way of dealing with things. You're acting stupid. Didn't I say I'd be the one contacting you? This is rather important. We found evidence of an affair. We have photos, and an audio tape. Well done. Give me everything you've got. How much are you willing to pay? How much? I know this evidence is not going directly to you, but you plan to share it with her lovers. What are you trying to say? Some people call it... blackmail. Stop screwing around. Well... It's just as easy for me to contact the otherside. I guess they'd be willing to pay ten times what you gave me. Besides, there are multiple players. How much do you want? Well... tonight, seven o'clock, here. Good afternoon. Oh, haven't seen you in a while. How's your business doing? It's okay. That's good. - Can I sit here? - Sure. Good afternoon. Would you like some coffee, or green tea? Coffee. So what brings you here? Would you run a check on this guy? - Tamio Okuyama. - Yes. Do you know him? A little bit. Mr. Nagishi, do you know him? I don't know him personally. But he got a lot of publicity recently in Japan, involved in a He was behind it all. He operates a real estate front... ...selling mansions between European and Japanese clients. Miss Rie, are you associated with him? Not really. Not at all. If you are, it's alright. But be careful. The rumor is... he embezzled the money, and the government and yakuza are after him. This is no place to be playing detective. Loren... I set up a transaction for tonight. Colt 45... How did you get this? Please be careful of Okuyama. If something happened to you... If the transaction goes well, let's go to Spain. I'll be waiting for you. The boss is waiting for you... Where are the photos and tape? Put it right there. Money first. The money is already on the table. You should've only done what I asked you to do. Did it go well? Some complications. What happened? I shot Okuyama. Did you kill him? Yes. I'm going to the police. Police? I'll go alone. This has nothing to do with you. Okuyama is dead. You can go away and be happy. Not quite. Son of a bitch! This was planned from the beginning. He deserved to die. Did anyone see you? A guy at the reception desk. Okuyama's stooge. - He was Japanese. - Probably Tanaka. I'm going back to see what's happening there. Don't do anything stupid. JAPANESE REAL ESTATE AGEN SHOT AND KILLED The funeral service was held today. An ugly affair with a closed casket. Sooner or later they'll catch me. Tanaka disappeared. - Why would he do that? - I don't know. Do you have any regrets? No. I was a bad woman to involve you in this mess. I have no regrets. If we had money... If we could use Okuyama's money... I could leave with you, and live happily everafter. Loren... I have photos and tape. Stay here. Will you be okay by yourself? Things will work out better this time. Good evening, Sir. Can I see Mr. Nemoto? May I ask your name? I have a delicate matter to discuss with him about Loren. Hold on for a moment, please. Mr. Nemoto? A gentleman wants to talk to you about Loren. Okay. Certainly. Please take the stairs, turn left, in the back. Stop it. Would you like to buy it from me? Stop it. Are you crazy? That's way too much. I don't think you have the cash. An accomplice. You bitch! Don't say bad things about her! Whore! This way. There's a secret passage. Why?! I couldn't help it. I was concerned about you. Plus he insulted me. I didn't know what I was doing. What are we supposed to do now? Let's go see the owner of Sports Gym. We can make a sting against him. No, we can't. We need to get money, so we can go to Spain. You don't have to do that. Trust me. It's my responsibility. Let's dance. I'm not in the mood. Want to tell us what's wrong? No. Good to see you. Two coffee... no, one with milk. Enter. Excuse me. You want to discuss something? Have a seat. Excuse me for not taking off my coat. And what did you want? About the gym... What? I heard a vicious rumor. Just tell me what. I heard a rumor that Mr. Hanada... ...was having sexual relations with club members... whether they were single or married. I'm ashamed of being Japanese if this rumor is true. - And what's wrong with it? - What? Is something wrong with enjoying sex with a woman? Well, the rumor creates bad word of mouth among women. You might have problems at the gym. Are you kidding? They only hope it's true. There's nothing else tosay. You better leave. Send someone in. No, I didn't mean to offend... Sorry to disappoint you... But you can't get money from me. You need me? He's ready to leave. Show him the way out. Not necessary. I already know the way out. I'm not a big fan of violence. Can't you read the no parking sign? What's wrong with you? I'm sorry. Leave here immediately. Yes, right away. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I messed up. That's alright. You should sleep. I'd prefer to... Where are you going? To see Hanada. I know how to deal with him. No. You can't argue with him. Don't worry. I know how to handle him. No way. If you really want to go, I'm coming with you. Ok, I'll leave it to you. Loren... Loren! Kishin! We need money. There's one more guy Okuyama was going to blackmail. He works for a stock exchange company. He lives alone. We'll do it for our future. Good afternoon. How are you? This time, my detective partner disappeared. Disappeared? I checked everywhere he usually goes. Maybe he found a girl. You aren't taking me seriously. I'm sorry. Look at this. It's our newspaper. Right here. Don't you think it looks like my partner? If you say so. Don't you think... We both know he's too much of a goofball for this. I hope you're right. What would you like me to do? Would you check some things for me? Thoroughly. Just as we planned? When I think about her having sex with that guy... I know it's part of the plan, but it's ripping my heart out. Loren! I'm here to help you. Loren... What's really going on here? Mr. Negishi? I can't think clearly. I understand. Thank you. The evidence relating to the four victims was found in the burnt car. Do you understand? You killed four people. The police will be here soon. It's not true. I only killed Okuyama. Please explain to me. I need to hear it. I told everything to Rie. That's the whole story. What can I... Negishi did some research on the brothel where we shot the photos. Apparently it's a secret club there in Bois de Boulogne. The four victims would meet there for private S&M parties. Loren was used as a pet for their games. Real Estate broker Okuyama... Art broker Nemoto... Sports gym boss Hanada... Stock broker Shiga... They are the group who embezzled 200 million dollars... ...from the Japanese banks, using fake collateral. - 200 million? - In cash. But they are all dead. One by one. What does that mean? Unless we catch the woman... You have no way out. Loren! Loren! You're the one who set everything up. You tried to kill Kishin. Who is your partner? Who? Tell us! Tell us who! Loren... Forgive me, Kishin. Please, Loren, tell us. Who is it? Loren. Okuyama. Okuyama? He is still alive. The dead body... his face was destroyed. I identified the dead body as Okuyama. But why? He wanted to disappear, to avoid the police investigation... ...with all the money in his hands. Okuyama... Let's be on the same team. What? I think we would work well together... With a lot of money. You're crazy. That didn't work? Well how about you? Didn't work either. Kishin... I told you we should buy a French car.
