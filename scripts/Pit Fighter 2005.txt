Fight! No! No! No! No! Come on! Yeah! Come on! Get him! Get him! Yeah, Yanqui! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! La cara! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! The winner!El Yanqui! He cannot be beaten! El Yanqui! Yanqui! Yanqui! Get him out! Yanqui! Manolo! Another win, huh? Keep the crowd happy. - Don't spend it all at once. - Did you count it yourself? All right. Let's go! Five years, fiighter. Five years, you made a lot of people a lot of money. Shh! You know who. Hey, that's yours. You earned it. Okay? Yeah! Good man. Adios! Adios! You know, he and I are brothers. Oh, shit! Nathan. Nathan. You're shot up pretty bad, old friend. Save your strength, all right? Marianne! Marianne! You hang in there, all right? Come on! Get him up! Get him in the truck! I may have done you a serious injustice, senor. Where am I? In my line of work, it pays to be able to assess a man's material worth. His fiiscal prowess. Only I can decide whether I work for money or for glory. - I can't breathe. - I'm not cheap. The Marietta wouldn't expect me to work for nothing, so they will have to pay. However, I owe them a considerable amount, so this will simply go against my debenture. A drop of mouse piss in a sizable ocean of excrement. You'll do about fine. Just try not to breathe deep. The stitches on your chest will fissure your tissue. You'll owe the Marietta for my service. That's the ironic injustice of all this. Is she dead? You're the sole survivor, as far as I know... and you're looking at the only surgeon in this whole flea-bitten province. They'll bring me back in a week, get your stitches out before they rot. Infection'll kill you deader than a 45 down here. I don't understand what you're saying. Como? Eso es un guero maricon. You seem to be recovering. How does what's left of your head feel? I don't remember who I am. What am I doing here? Well, your existence has been simplifiied then. He says you're working La Marietta... and that could entail any manner of thing. You owe them a substantial amount. I hope your trade is a lucrative one. The Marietta? You suffered massive cranial trauma, a serious concussion, extensive tissue damage. not to mention the loss of a fiist-sized portion of your brain matter. It's reasonable to expect that may have caused a mild amnesiac situation. I daresay you will regain certain memories. Don't expect it to happen overnight, however. - I've lost my memory! - They're dangerous people! Please don't ask me about them! I have a family I'd like to see again someday, so don't make the mistake! of thinking that because I'm an American, I'm any more your friend than they are! Why, I would sell you out in a gnat's heartbeat if I thought it would buy me some credit! Actions, smells, sounds, like certain familiar tunes on the radio! um, uh, an intimate face can sometimes act like the key! to the metaphysical door your mind has closed! Who did this to me, Doc? Time to remove your stitches! You'll have to stop talking! It will hurt! May I suggest you take a shot of this? I don't drink. You remembered that! We get caught with this load, we all go down! They'd be more suspicious if someone who looks like you gets involved. - How do I look,Jack? - Like nothing I've ever seen before! This could be trickier than we anticipated! I don't know! I don't see you have a lot of options, kid! They run these mule teams, shouldering bundles of weed! up into Arizona, New Mexico, but it's dangerous work, and it pays shit! That is, if you don't end up in la tumba del mojado. The wetback's grave! And you just pay the interest on the loan, basically! I recommend a trade, if you've got one! And if you don't, fiind one! Or else- Come on! Let's get out of here! All these sweaty men make me nervous, man! Come on! Hey, maybe I can fiight! No! Uh-uh-uh-uh! You see these guys? They're hard-core cage fiighters! They will eat you for breakfast! And in case you haven't noticed, your skin is just a few shades lighter than everybody else! Okay? You stand out like a diamond on a goat's ass! Don't even think about it! This feels familiar! Yeah, well, so will the hospital! Do you understand? - Come on! - Find me some gloves! Whoa! Your stitches haven't even healed, okay? Your skull is being held together by bailing wire! Think about it! This is not your game! Now, I suggest we get out before you die! - Whoa! - Whoa! Can I make money doing this? Yeah, maybe! This suit is 20 years old! Why do you try so hard? Because I'm an Indian, you know? I couldn't go to their schools! My home where I grew up had a straw roof! Just a couple of drops in the sea of life's injustices, fiighter! Well, you ever wanna know what God thinks about money! you look at those to whom he gives it to! Wish me luck, eh? This guy's, uh- no girls, no, uh, drinking... no gambling, nothing. He donates all his pocket money to the priests at the church! And he gives all his free time! He helps out, you know? And in return, he gets a cot and free meals! He'd make a dream fiighter! Carlos, cabron, chasing women is a form of higher education! I have little faith in men that don't! Yes! Si. Si. Yes, right! But, uh- But, see, but he's from el otro lado. You know? I mean, who knows what his real problem is, you know? Uh, but,you know, nobody's beat him yet. He's disciplined. He'd be perfect for your stable, jefe. Are you implying that I may turn a profiit? He has a theory- este loco- about not humiliating the opponent! Uh, he allows them to punch him, you know! and pummel him and show off and show their stuff, you know! for rounds and rounds, and then suddenly- flat! He knocks 'em out cold! Pero si, and then he's happy! that he hasn't made them, you know, lose face! I mean, it's- it's the perfect showmanship! He'll be very popular! You'll make a fortune! And you know how they feel about the gringos in la tierra blanca! Right? Three months, cabron. We show a profiit in three months! or you owe the interest of his debt! For the time wasted! Understand? Si. Si. Gracias. Three months, cabron. This gringo had a valuable talent before! A real valuable talent! You are sure this gringo doesn't remember anything? No! Nada, nada, nada. Okay! You know that guy will screw us if he's got a chance, boss! He's a snake! I don't like him! Carlitos, that man is hungry! And hungry men always have their uses! Remember that! It's not a friendly crowd, okay? They're gonna try to intimidate you, 'cause they know it's your fiirst fiight! But you just do the way you do in the gym, you'll be okay! Coming to us all the way from Esperanza, Mexico! undefeated in 14 matches- Well, they haven't seen your color yet! You ready to start, all right? Zambista! Go! Known only as El Yanqui! !Yanqui! Are you ready? Are you ready? !Yanqui!Yanqui! !Yanqui!Yanqui! Hit him! You have to hit him, or else we're headed for the minus pool! We're both screwed! You understand? He's the champion! Gotta let him have his time out of respect! - I'll beat him with dignity! - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! - Well, fiirst you gotta hit him, my friend! Hit him! Yanqui! Yanqui! Yanqui! !Yanqui!Yanqui! Listen to me! Hey, you, listen! I took a chance on you, okay? I put everything into you! The whole church thing, the Virgin Mary and everything! And I fell for it like a sucker? Is that your game? Third round defeat is acceptable! What? What are you talking about? For a champion! Okay! Okay! All right! All right! !Yanqui!Yanqui!Yanqui! !Yanqui!Yanqui!Yanqui! What's goin'on? - And we have a new winner! - Yes! Yes! !Yanqui!Yanqui! Let's hear it for Yanqui! - Let's go! - Yanqui, our new winner! Yanqui! Marianne. You know, when we fiirst met! I was trying to fiigure out, like, four different ways to kill you! and make it look like it wasn't my fault! Yeah! I don't know what stopped me! I guess I, uh- guess I never actually killed a gringo! We're partners, Manolo! Cabron, you were my punishment! You were my penance! Yeah! Turned out to be my savior! Saved my life! Gave me a reason for being! It's hot, man! It's hot! Well- Well, chico, you must've loved that woman a lot, man! I talk to her every day! About what? About my day, my life! - Boxing? - Everything. She knows everything. Yeah, well! Mira. Eh, you know, I was thinking! uh, that's great! I know you put some money aside, 'cause I never see you spend any! Which is smart! You're a smart boy! I was thinking, you know, you could move on, you know? You know, and live a little, you know? I know that she'll tell me when it's time to leave! She's a strong woman! You know that? - She's- - I mean, she was a strong woman. But that strength lives on! It lives on in me! - You understand, right? - Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm! Yeah! Yeah! Uh, yeah, well, okay! Um, tienes hambre. I'm gonna go warm up the truck, okay? Uh, tienes hambre, eh? My people are like this dust! We start in the mountains, come down! with the rivers, riding in trucks, on the wind! Itinerant as the Santa Ana! Fighter, there's no great advantage! in knowing what your past is! See, I know mine, and I'll tell you! my old man, his pa, was a tequilero. He used to smuggle wine, Havana wine! up San Ysidro, the devil's backbone! So, naturally, he went into the family business! Cocaina contrabando. Cocaine! You know cocaine? And then heroin from Tepatitlan! My grandpa was gunned down! outside the town of Badriaguato! To the criminal class! without whom there would be no heroes! Los criminales. Jack? Jack Severino! They told me you'd been buried in the jungle outside of Agualilla! It's me. It's Nathan. Senor, this man is the Yanqui. He is a well-known fiighter! Around here, anyway! I know you! Yeah, you work for the Marietta, Veneno's company! I got no issue with you. Tierra Caliente? Michocan? It was me who scraped you off the road for Veneno! Jack, I drove 70 miles with the smell of your blood going rotten on my hands, man. - Sorry, man! - Senor, you are in error! I know your face! I know it well! 'Cause when the fiists were flying, or even the bullets... I've stood back-to-back with you! I've been soaked to the skin with rain, sweat and blood! I've smelled death on a spring afternoon. I've defeated the hands of an enemy that doesn't know Christ! Yours is a face with only one side. So help me,Jack! that I might be struck down where I stand if I lie! but I would die for you, my brother. Your place isn't with this panhandling gutter trash! Whatever misfortunes overcome you, you call me, all right? I'm at the Ambassador Hotel for the next two days! I saw your new shoes. New seda shirt, Manolo. You're looking good! Now, the more successful you become, the less you can trust those around you! You never won anything before, did you? I never believed in anything! - Do you like Cuban cigars? - Sure! Gracias,jefe. He's going to win his next fiight? I know where my money's going! Hey, he asked you a question. I never noticed you before, Manolo! It's always the quiet ones. Are you ambitious? Don't answer that! If you had said no, then I'd be really suspicious. I like boxing. Isn't there a fiighter that you're supposed to be training? Uh, it's his, uh, day off. You know, Sunday. Go! Take the day off with him! Did you go to church? Go to church. Do something. Go, go. What? What the fuck is wrong? Giving that peasant one of your best cigars? That lowlife! Look at the way he dresses! Mira, Carlitos. I'm going to tell you a story! I remember this crusty old fuck, Paulino, from the mountains! He had to have been He ran a mule packed of dope every day through my village for three years! until someone squealed to the federales. Now, what nobody knew! was that Paulino was a real motherfucker! He took a large snort of cocaine! drank a whole bottle of wine and prepared an ambush! Killed every soldier in the squad! and then hunts down the squealing fuck who set him up! What I'm trying to tell you! what I'm trying to make you understand is that this only comes to show! that you must never, never judge a man by his appearance! You got a point there, jefe. End of my speech! I've seen her! She's alive! Everything is gonna come together for me! Hey, loco! I'm coming in! Good morning! 5:00 a!m! You want coffee? Come on! Wakey, wakey. Eggs and bakey. Yanqui, Yanqui, it's been fiive years! She could have moved on, you know? She thought you were dead! That doesn't matter! I know she's coming! Hey, we gotta pick up the pace here, will ya? Come on! Come on! Sprint! You know, my grandmother could read the future! My mother too! They made a living at it! I will, too, when I get too old and ugly for this work! I can read your face! Your hands! Turn them over! Let me see! You have deep lines! That's good! Some luck, and then- - They say nothing! It's all fiine! - So what's my fortune? There's nothing there! Meeting you! was the best thing that ever happened to me! They're treating us like we're sons of the family! Do you understand? They love us! - That's good! - Yeah! Listen! I understand them though! I know what they're about! They're animals, you know? Never forget that! They're not like you! They don't feel any empathy with their opponent! They'll kill mercilessly without hesitation! We ever cross them, they'll bury us! Just- Those are the rules down here, you know? That's why they survived for so long! But right now I'm in! You're in! Life is good! Hmm? It's damn good! Yeah. Then we should be careful not to cross them! - Right? - Yeah! You want a girl? Hmm? The one over there? She's a three-way hen! - You know what that means? - No, thanks! Yeah, well- You are a good influence on me! You know that? Yeah, you are! But you're not gonna fiind any peace by avoiding life! Come on! Let's get outta here! I think I might not have been the best of men! I'm changed now! I'm not like that anymore! I envy you,Jack! You've no memories! Yeah, but I have no peace, Father! Today is the day! Try to appreciate it! I've tried to win with grace to channel my anger! I knock 'em out as quickly as possible! So you feel justifiied in the eyes of the Almighty? I don't know, Father! Look, be heroic, my son! Because out of heroism lies faith! in the worth of heroes! Do you think that when Castro dies and the U!S! moves back into Cuba! do you think that the quality of the tobacco will change? I don't know, jefe! Eh, I never smoked a cigar! They make me ill, remember? I hear that El Julio is wanting to do a mano a mano! I hear that he's back from Spain and he wants to wrestle back his crown! - in front of his hometown! - Verdad! If it happens, it will be quite a corrida. Yeah! Do you follow the bulls? Eh, ahem, when I was, uh, younger! It was a young, uh, bull. I can't remember their names. Your boy's lined up to fiight El Diablo again. - Tonight! - Si! No, tomorrow night. Tomorrow night. - Okay, tomorrow night! - Yeah. I want him to lose the fiight! No!?Como? Nobody's betting against him anymore. Every time he fiights we take a loss! The guy has already become a legend, a pinche baliente! Pero,jefe- Better we could load it on a particular round maybe! I could take him to the tenth round maybe! He can drag it out! - And it would be spectacular. - Not if he wins! But the people, they put their money- They bet on El Yanqui. They bet on him! That is not your problem! Okay, okay, okay, okay! Tomorrow night he goes down! Bottom line! Okay, I'll tell him, all right? Did somebody hear me say that I was fiinished? Sit down! Okay, here's the deal, cabron. If he doesn't go down! then you are going to be replaced by a coach! that understands what this business is all about! Do you fully comprehend me when I say the word "replaced'"? R-E-P-laced. No, I- Like when I say I am going to replace my big dog! I shot him twice behind the ear! and I threw it in a bonfiire made out of car tires soaked in diesel! Two day later I go back, I hose the whole area down... not even a fucking little stain! Okay, now I'm fiinished! Now I'm fiinished, and you're gonna stay here sitting like a fucker! Get the fuck out ofhere, vago! Don't take it personal! I'll act it up and play it out! And we'll be fiine. Just remember, don't bet any money on me tomorrow! Wh-What? You- I don't understand you. You're full- You're- It's okay. When I lose the fiight tomorrow... my career is over! It's a sign. A sign? You still think she's coming, huh? Of course I do! Well, okay! Get yourself together! - Yeah! - Let's go. Okay! There's a precept in Castilian culture! which believes that the true measure of a man! is gauged by those who are benefiitted by his actions! If I go by that, you are the greatest man I ever met! You need to travel more, Father! Promise me, my friend, that you won't do anything impulsive! Don't worry! Someone put a huge bet on that Brazilian! so now the odds are way off! All these people coming down here tonight,just to bet on you. I mean, little kids using their pocket money and shit like that! So what are you gonna do? My neighbor sold his cattle today just to raise a stake. They shouldn't gamble! Tonight will be a lesson! Oh, yeah! Make me sick! It's over! Hey, wave her off! Ask him not to bet! You can't do that! These are normal people, okay? They bet! They're not bad people! Look at them. Jesus, they couldn't watch their friends lose their life savings! And what are you thinking? I'm telling you, you win, you win this fiight! within an hour all bets will be off on you! Marietta will lose his shirt! Well, Marietta will blame me! You have to get yourself a new manager! My conscience is clear! Diablo Calvera! Okay, you do what you want! You're supposed to lose! Just go down! I want him to lose the fiight! Everybody's coming down here to bet on you! Every time he fiights, we take a loss! You can't do that! These are normal people! Promise me, my friend, you won't do anything impulsive! I think it's time to leave! Listen! I can sleep well tonight, if I live through the night! - All right! Come on! - I don't know what happened! I snapped! Yeah! - We better go! - Marianne! - No, where you going? Wait! - Marianne! Oh, oh, okay! He went that way! Fuck him! Dios mio! This is bad! This is really bad! That way! Kill him! Kill that son of a bitch! You got me? Just get him! You come with me! I don't know who you are, but I know you stood between me and Marianne! - What are you doing here with her? - No! I should have killed you when I had the chance,Jack! Come on! Listen, listen, listen! Listen to me! Listen to me. Listen. I don't know what your problem is here, okay? I don't care. But if you don't move, we're both gonna die. Do you understand me? - Okay? - We don't have time for this! Follow us! - Go, go, go! - Follow us! Get off the street! Pour him a shot,Jack. You really don't remember anything? I'll have a slug of that angel's tea! Just you and me, laughing! And him, shooting at me! I always was a lousy shot! I came down on a university placement, teaching! Got involved with the antigovernment factions and the guerrilla movement! - Marianne became passionate about their cause- - Nice tattoo,Jack! And persuaded me to leave my lecturing job! We decided to do something. We became freedom fiighters. Every man should do his bit for the revolution! This could be trickier than we anticipated! What kind of, uh, armament are you carrying,Jack, if you don't mind me asking? I don't mind you asking me, Harry. !45s!Just plain old!45s! - Plain old engraved.45s, eh? - That's right. - What are you packing, Harry? - It's a nine! It was recommended to me by a friend in Botswana! I'll, uh, I'll draw you for a look,Jack! Sure. Be careful! It's loaded. My nine holds more bullets than both of yours put together! From my experience, the gunfiight is about the one left standing when it's over! You shoot fiirst, you shoot fast... and you always shoot to kill! You never leave your opponent the chance to prove himself. Gunfiighting's not a sport, Harry! That's, uh, that's lovely,Jack! Thank you very much! I'm, uh, I'm going to retire to bed, okay? You coming, dear? I'm just gonna fiinish my drink! Good night,Jack! Didn't mean to show him off like that! He's just not used to this! He usually lectures at a university on social issues and reform! So you're doing this for the improvement of mankind, huh? That's what we planned, yeah! Think giving guns to the rebels is gonna help them? Who says we're giving them guns? No one! You know,you're very different than Harry. I bet you this was all your idea, wasn't it? You're making a lot of assumptions tonight,Jack! Do you really wanna leave? In this world, there's no code of honor! just survival of the fiittest! Never trust anyone! Or believe anybody! When St! Peter stands in front of you, just you and him! never form a tie! Harry, how did you hide those guns from police? What guns? In the chassis or in the crates! How did you do it? I don't know what you're talking about. Fine! I'll fiind out anyway! What's this? You're not a good judge of character, Harry! You're not taking those trucks to Tuxtla! - What? - Stay right here. I'll get those guns anyway! You're screwing us,Jack! Marianne! You're coming with me! We're leaving Harry here! You called these people in on us! We trusted you with our lives,Jack! I trusted you with everything! Good, then you're both staying here! I'm taking the trucks! - Do something, Harry! - What can I do? Oh, my God! Come on! I want these guns found now! Get them! Strip the truck! Get them! Strip the truck! Harry! It's okay. It's okay. Jesus,Jack, what happened to you? Marianne! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No. Harry. -?Esta muerto? -?Quien es el? ?Quien es el? ?Esta muerto? There's no guns here, is there? It's just food and medical supplies, right? Been a while since I've seen a white woman shot up the way you are! What a waste! We took a risk and lost everything. Like she said, we lost everything. Our positions, everything we worked for! We decided to help those people! - Why did you return? - We robbed the fiight! Took us fiive years to plan it, but we fiinally got back what belongs to us. The house money? Every penny of it goes to the guerrilla cause,Jack. We'll fiinally sleep at night! You won't live through the night! Hey, that's why they called for reinforcements. Fighter, I can't be around these people! Let's go! I mean, dancing the wire monkey's for corrido singers... not people who want to live! We could be in Ixtapa by morning! Manolo, go and tell the Marietta where their money is! - That should set you straight! - That's how it is, huh? Get out of here! Go and live! You know... you're the only brother I've ever known, cabron. I will be less without you! It was nice while it lasted,J ack! You changed to a!45, Harry! That's smart! You know it was my love for you that allowed me to survive! I loved you in the purest way for fiive years! You should leave now! Don't take the interstate! Use the Pan Americana Highway. And don't look back! Get outta here! Go! Go! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! !Espera!Espera! Hey, don't shoot! Don't shoot! No! Look! Hey! Manolo! Where you going? My friends, uh- My name is, uh, Manuel Cesar Carrillo! And there's not a man here... who has the right to watch me beg for my life! These bastards are in there! Jefe, The outrageous stupidity and plain ignorance of a person! that thinks they can come and steal from me in my own town! - and get away from it! -!Vamos! That deserves something special! No one is to fiire a fucking shot until I say so! Do you understand? I want the cafe surrounded! I want the cafe surrounded now! Hey, man, do you have a copy? Do you have that as a Polaroid? Oye, cabron. This is your opportunity! I trust you know what to do! Are they still in there? I saw them coming in! There's movement inside! You must never show them your weak side, cabron. What are you doing here, fiighter? Your money is inside! The Yankee thiefs? Too bad! Why are you here, fiighter? I'm here for you, jefe. There is no money inside, is there? The bitch with one eye! Her name is Marianne! Que dice? Esta loco. He's a boxer, boss. Let's get the money. Jack Severino. For seven years, he was the last resort! His was the number you called when you absolutely had to kill a man! For $7,000, he would execute anyone! They said he had no heart! That he slaughtered women and children too! Can you believe that shit, Carlitos? But you did better than most,Jack. You lived twice! Now, do you think I can let someone get away with this shit? From here to Nuevo Laredo! there is not a truck stop or cantina that I don't have a piece of! Every mota-breathing barrio bandit that ever had a dream of being anyone! will be searching for them. While I breathe! they don't stand a cholo's chance in Vegas, cabron. - They are dead,Jack. - I won't let you touch them! Well, it has to be this way, pinche fiighter cabron. Espidida. Ah, you remembered! What more triumphant an end can there be... than to be raked by the fiiery rash of a hundred marksmen's cartridges? Blistered where I stand like bleeding shredded hamburger. If I could only choose.
