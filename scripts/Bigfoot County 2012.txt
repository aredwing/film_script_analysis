My plan is to place the emergency call of this man, try to interview to him and to the people, and then we'll see what happens. So-Good ... to contact you called Emergency 4. 5 00: 02: 38.559 - 00: 02: 42.688 you'd have to get someone I told you who he is. And then, if he told you where to go, then you acampar?as.

Siskiyou County, where we will go, they have seen than anywhere else in the world. The most recent report, that says a Bigfoot He attacked a dog, It is the first aggressive sighting known of Bigfoot. So it's aggressive. It is the first time that has passed in the history of Bigfoot. Usually they are pretty ... Boring. They try to avoid contact with humans, just stay away, but that's why I was intrigued, I was thrilled to want to do this. I was not planning, I was lucky with the sighting I was that guy. The most important folk legend US is the Bigfoot. It existed for over 200 years and thousands of people around the world They say they have seen. I do not think that so many people lying about it. But no other name? - Something like ... - Sasquatch. It is called Sasquatch in Canada, Bigfoot in United States and Europe is the Yeti or Abominable Snowman. - Then it's white. - Yes, it is white. Bigfoot is black and Sasquatch is coffee. Here we go to the race. - Is not that. - Racist. - Let's make history. - Yes. - Remember that. - History. If you can shoot something ... - And live. - And live. Just do not say that. We will live. But if you can film something so'd show in the history books and that would be sensational. It is exciting Why pursue. - Yes Fabulous.. - I'm ready. Then the camera only we will follow. L.A. AIRPOR It is in good shape. That does not sound good. Does it bother me because it's right in my face? Thanks, Stephon. My grandmother used them when I was a kid, He said to bring good luck. Your grandmother used leagues? My favorite color is black. Have you always used ...? There are superstitious people. Read Information card located in the pocket the seat in front of you. Be sure to turn the functions your phone ... - And Bluetooth- - Enough. They can not be used in flight. We are super excited. We just landed. Not bad flight on a plane La Bamba. She happy to sleep on your back. Yes. It's going to wake up when we see Bigfoot ... At about wine, to carry me. Or we know to call, who die I wait to see. Sure, go ahead. I'm very excited. Let's get to the carousel. We did this trip to shoot the man. It is the main reason why we came, and perhaps to give a walk in the woods. But as I said before was coming and it turns out that this gentleman He saw Big Foot, so that will ... it is a best documentary. If you are not do the best you can, but if it is I think I can do something special, so ... Uh ... How strange. You do not have your cell phone service? No. Insurance? Try again, maybe ... What try again? No, no service. No service. You have a bar? - What company are you? - Nothing. Is that the statue? - Damn, films that, man. - Look. I f?lmalo. You have to shoot it. - Fuck. - We got off? Yes, Let's get off to film that. Siskiyou County! We Arrived! - Here we are. - We did it. Finally we are here! Yes. You have to shake hands. Shake hands the Bigfoot himself. Hi, Mom! We are living our dreams big. I will ask marriage eggs under Bigfoot. - What do you want? - Water. Good. And you? Whatever ... Something to eat. Some dried meat. - Good. - I do not give jerky. No more jerky. A deodorant. Why? You do not like that smell? No! That stuff sucks. It was an accident. I suck, I'm tired of smell. What is this town sucks. Yes, I can not even ... How are you? They got lost? - No. - Not at all. What do you do with that camera? Filming ... It's a nice place. Why not turn off? It does not work. Up windows, please. Heaven. What happens to those people? Yes, that was balls. Very good. Did you see his appearance? What about your teeth? The truth did not see his appearance, because I could not see past his black teeth. They stared us to leave. And they smelled as if they had not bathed in 6 months or more. - I'm not exaggerating. - OMG! And he is CREATING his shirt, yuck. - Neither the look. - Let's go. CAMP ARROYO OF MOOSE Look, not even note we approach. I'll be surprised. Friend, here are two. That's great. Well, this is our charming cottage. Plane will go. You should not see, because I am the future brother. Are you sleeping again? Shy! Really? It is dormid?sima. It has been a long journey, but we have to ... go to town to walk, maybe talk to some people. I want to ask who is the man called emergencies. - Do me a favor. - Which? I know you will not, but when interviewing people We not insist on something I can make them angry. - I know you will not, but ... - How am I going to insist? I know you and I know you will say "Big Foot". "Have you seen Bigfoot?" Maybe these people do not want ... These people are very direct, That's for sure. Do you think something like could exist in this area? Well ... There ... There are noises in the forest not explained. I ... I've heard them and heard others talk about them. Some of these noises ... They are very rare. You can not explain that ... At least we we can not explain, and it is something that we live here in remote areas. The sun sets at 8:00 and 8:30. 7:00 or 7:30, if you're in the woods, you're screwed. It's dark and you're not going to walk from side to side. If you grab the night there, better sit and stay where you are. You do not want to walk around there. Did you miss people in those woods? Not that I know of. If they were lost, perhaps grabbed the drug cartel. What's with that? Mexican planting pot. You do not want to run into them, You may not return. Are there people who sows speck here? What do you people do here? 2. 3. 4 00: 12: 03.665 - 00: 12: 07.336 It is the main source of income the Siskiyou County. I heard marijuana plant here. Yes. How do you know where that is in the forest? You'll walk. You should go for a walk, and if you see a plantation ... you long there, because otherwise they could kill with one stone. What do you think could eat one Bigfoot? Goats are tasty. Also the chicken. I came for a couple of months I saw the news ... and a guy said a Bigfoot he had halved his dog. - Really? - It was in this county. - In this county? - Yes, so I came. Have you heard anything about that? No, I had never heard. He halved his dog. People tell me that has dogs trained to hunt bears and stuff. Out, and suddenly the dogs run to get into the van or under it and begin to whine. They hear screams, someone They throw stones and all that. It seems that dogs do not feel comfortable with those things and there must be a reason for it. I do not see it. I see a cougar so. Or a bear. A Bigfoot? I say ... you know. If something happens around here ... anyone here know before in fact happen, man. So it is. And it was probably a cougar which halved the dog. He said it was Bigfoot. What are you smoking? I want. Nape heard a Bigfoot attack ... to animals or humans ... in my life. How does this story make you feel? - If true. - I think that's a lie. I do not believe that Bigfoot He had halved that dog. Do you know who it was, or something about that story? I ... I do not wanna talk about it. - A jar. - Look! Land of Bigfoot. I think I need coffee after this trip. Coffee, quickly. Uuuuu, Bigfoot. It's scary. A glass of Earth Bigfoot. - My tequila. - You have to buy it. - I could put my tequila in my coffee. - Good idea. I want to find a man it is supposed to be called emergencies, saying Bigfoot He split his dog. Have you heard anything about that? I asked him 10 or 15 people and nobody knew what were we talking about. I know who could do that. - Not seriously? - Yes. I think it's here passing this curve. What do you think? If we look, what will you say? I do not know if he is that man. First of all I will start talking with the, being friendly. I felt a blow to the head. - No we attract more- - Was ...? I did not do that. No we attract more attention than necessary. - Is the? - I think so. I'll see if he is. - Stay here. - Agree. It does not look very happy, friend. I do not know if I should do that. - Shit. - Stephon! I think you should go for it. I am not under the car. Heaven. Heavens! - Stephon, get in the car. - Get in the car! Wait, guys. it's okay. He was a little ... He thought I was in the press and he was removed from the roll, - But there's no problem. - He had an ax. He's fine, I gave her space and all that. No anger. It will not do anything. Hi, whats up friend? Hello. He's my ... He is my brother Davee, and his girlfriend, Shy. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm Travis. How are you, Travis? Come on. Just I wanted to make that they are not in the press. - Everything is fine. - We are not of the press, I promise. Where I can put this? Where you go to be more comfortable. Hence there is a stone. A concrete block. You want to sit? Yes. Is that OK? - Yes. - Well, I ... I filmed. . Stay you here. Faith is powerful. Religions sometimes not ... you get them all. 3. 4. 5 00: 18: 04.818 - 00: 18: 08.072 There are, you know, the perfect shoe. But when you find it, you accept and are part of it, and it takes and makes you a better person. I've seen it. I have witnessed his strength, of its power. His eyes the bottom of my soul. How were your eyes? Large, red ... I looked directly. I was there. He looked into my eyes when I was praying, trying to find a signal. He turned and walked away. Theo gave chase. We follow, we follow and we follow. They must have been several miles. And we got a runner, Y ... the ... The dog continued. I stopped, I could not follow ... and I told Theo: "Come, come, come back." Theo finally ran back as if frightened And ... We were here ... some days after, and returned, he loaded the dog and he broke it in two. - Oh Lord. - What he halved? To the half. In front of me, she broke in half. They can not go. It is haunted. They can not go. There's something about that corridor. When you get to that road ... it is ... In the region the Marble Mountains. ?Bigfoot is in those mountains? Yes. I'd love to go into the woods with you, be there one day ... to see what happens and how is this area. I had never been here, so I do not know where to go. You've been here five years, and obviously knows the area better than me. Come tomorrow. Really? - Come tomorrow. - Perfect. - With pleasure. - Go away. I think they're crap. But as you want, I came to support you. ?"Nonsense"? What do you mean, fuck? Let her brother. - That came ... - I understand. - To talk to this guy. - I already know it. Leave her in the car, fuck. Leave her in the car! it's okay. It's just ... I do not want to push me in religion. How do we talk about ...? - A dog and Bigfoot a- - Would you shut the door? Before I change my mind. Suddenly we are in a Bible school. Do not exploit, stay out of religion. Well, since you are so friends and I have understood which it is a documentary- You know why we came. You told me apoyabas. That's right, a thousand percent, and we both agree. Know that this type it would be something different. "Something different" is one thing. Demented is another. He left with an ax in his hand. Did you see around you? Did you see? Some had axes 8 different sizes. I saw machetes, hammers ... Hey, he lives in a forest. People live differently here. - I think ... - With all those animals? I think there are rare sacrifices there. I think you need to calm down and we have to sleep. It has been a long journey. The three ... we are tired. Tomorrow will be a new damn day, we will see the type and see what happens. Shit. Dammit. Fuck. What are you doing? - Dammit! - What are you doing? What the hell are you doing? - What are you doing? - I thought I heard something. Just kidding? It's 5:00 in the morning, 4:00, 3:00 in the morning. You scared me, dammit! Go to sleep. go to sleep ... please have a heavy day tomorrow. For the love of God. Ven. We must rise. Awake. Already we made us one hours later. She is old, I swear. We are in the forest and you want to fix the hair. Already you list, my love? I can not stand being late and she knows it. - It is unprofessional. - You know what? ?Dont professional? - It is. - I told you to wake me up at 9:30. - At least you could ... - I had to repack. Whatever. - How are you? - Good. Sorry I'm late. Well, it's not a good start. It's my fault. - Women. - Yes. Let's pray for a moment. - Bow your heads. - Good heavens. Nods. You want ...

"And Jabaz called the God of Israel, saying: 'You really bless me and you agrandar?s my territory, May your hand be with me and protect me from evil to not cause pain. ' And God granted him what he requested. " The Father, the Son ... Holy water. Ceo I ... you're good. - Well, let's go. - Amen. What the fuck do, eh? Fuck. Sorry. She will be a problem.

Do you like poetry? - It does to me. - Yes. - Definitely. - Travis, be good for my documentary. Otherwise, we would be walking alone. It would be good to read a couple of things in the path before reaching the place which we spoke. I got this for years. - My poem. - A poem? Everyone should have a poem. It is ... Is the Bible? No. Only I keep it there. It is called "Live my life". "I live my life in increasing orbits Moving on the things of the world. We may never reach the ultimate but that will be my attempt. I have gone round about God And around of the ancient towers. I've been around for a thousand years and still I do not know if I'm a storm, a hawk or a beautiful song. " It was written in 1899. Who wrote it? - What is this? - This? It's to mark our way not to lose. He read it in a book. Do they read fairy tales? Hansel and Gretel "?

Why can question our methods ...? But when I question, my brother and my girlfriend bother me for having questioned? I just want to learn ... Do not judge ... because the rod that midas you will be measured. It sounds good. - What does it mean? - Means that no judge. Who's in charge here? You. Shut up. You had to mess with your damn righteousness. The Lord is in His holy temple. The Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes behold, His gaze examines humankind.
