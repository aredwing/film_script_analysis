Bye! - Do not offend my friends. - Bye, Fatso! Over! She told you already. Wait for me. No! - Suzanne. - Yes? Throw this away. I will give it to Dad later. Let's play "Yes or No". - Do you like Grandpa? - Grandpa Jerzy? Not really. He stinks. His mouth stinks! Easy with Grandpa Jerzy. We must go to the hospital right now. When you're old, your teeth rot. It is true. All old people stink. - You? - That's enough. Did you find the answer? Here's a clue: They eat Sauerkraut. Which is the capital? The capital is... - Look it up. - I'll ask the teacher. No, look it up. Why? To see if you know how. It is interesting. A message. Can I press it? Sure, go ahead. Hello, it's Irene. II'm calling to ask you to dinner. How about next Friday, if you can... I'd like it very much. Call me. I kiss the three of you. Make the table. The food is ready. Clean up your stuff. And you, no rollerskates in the house. They are for outside. - Haven't I told you? - Yes. - Why do you keep doing it? - I don't know. We didn't eat today at school. Why? We played and no-one looked for us. So we missed lunch. What's all this? The truth. Were you left alone, the two of you, at the schoolyard? Nobody saw you? We played with the older children. And they had already eaten. So... Maria, did you not eat, too? I don't remember. - You don't remember if you ate? - No. Now, look, Maria... What's wrong with your brain? Did you eat or no? Maria, reply. Were you at the cantine or no? I don't know. You're kidding me? Did you eat or no? I don't know. What's on your mind? What's your game? What's your problem? Hello, you have called the Merevskys. Please leave your message. Good afternoon, this is lrene. Well... Hi. She's a Cheerleader. Hi! Do you see my skirt? - I made it myself. - It looks cheap. Did it go well? - I'll take your bag. - Thanks. - With sausage? - No, that one is mine. Yours is the one with ham. - Did you butter Suzanne's? - Yes. Plenty of butter for you. Thanks, dad! You're really generous. We have to make you fat. Not with half a slice of ham... What makes your ass shake? It's love! What do you find under your blouse? It's love! Why did you marry wearing jeans? It's gross. - It's not. - They are his best jeans. It was mom's idea. - Did she ask you to wear them? - Yes. Everybody congatulated me about how I looked. - I'll make your wedding dress. - My wedding dress? - Stop it. - A cheap one! Dad, she has to pay a fine for this. Do you see them Suzanne? Good looking guys at 2 o' clock. Take your pick. The one with the white shirt? Hello guys! Are you going bowling? No, we're going to the bar. Are you coming? Not so good! - Ask Suzanne? - I brought the drinks. And I brought everything else. It's always the same. She will clean up. That's enough, Maria. - ''That's enough, Maria!'' - You will clean up. I do not need a parrott. Be good. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Please excuse me for keeping you waiting. Thank you for coming immediately. I could have called you, but it's better face to face. So... I have talked about it a lot with Suzanne. And she wanted me to be the one to tell you. Well... I will be straightforward. There is no other way. Your daughter is pregnant. She is more than 3 months pregnant. Do you understand? - Do you understand, sir? - Yes. She must visit a gynecologist immediately. She told me she has none. I can recommend someone, if you want. Why are you keeping it? I feel like it. - Hi dad. - Hi. - Did you have a nice trip? - Yes. - Where is Suzanne? - She's inside. Go in. - Hi! - Beer made me the man I am! How sexy! - Did you wear those for me? - You wish! Hi. Glad to see you. My sister made me up. You don't look like your sister.

The door! I will drive. Help! Woman at the wheel! I won't destroy your car. Have you got your driver's lisence with you? - What? - Nothing. I haven't got one yet. Are you kidding? This car has cost me a year's salaries! I still pay for it. Stop! Slow down... What are you doing? It's not a bumper car! Stop! Go lighter on the pedal. You'll break it! Don't worry.

I can't. Hey, what are you doing here? Hey beautiful! A kiss? How are you? I called you at work, but I didn't find you. Do you plan to stay for long? I don't know. What about your job? I took a leave without pay. Really... Charlie, watch out, you'll drop her stuff. Don't worry. No problem. Can you take care of him this afternnon? I have something to do. Hi Nick. Hi Julien. - How are you? - Fine. - What can I bring you? - A coffee, please. How are you? It took you quite a while. Don't forget to lock up, please. - Good night. - Good night. - Are you alone? - Yeah. - Are you hungry? - A little. I'll fix us something to eat. Did we wake you up last night? Yes. How's things at work? We have a lot to do. Are your bosses okay? The usual. Did she talk to you about my situation? A little. My family lives up North. I can't return there. I have no-one here. I save the money I make at the races. You don't mind that Suzanne quit her job for you? I didn't ask her to. She made her own choice. You know your sister. When she gets an idea... Suzanne is the best thing that has happened to me. I will never let her down. I love her. Hey you. Suzanne cares a lot about you. She keeps telling me stories. Drink. What stories? All the things you took upon yourself. She says you are brave. Do you think so? Yes... - I had to see you. - Yeah? Is everything okay? Not really. What is it? Nothing serious. I have to leave for a little while. Later we'll find a small apartment. What have you done? I can't tell you, it'll bring you bad luck. I'll tell you when it's over. I don't want you to leave. You see that? Look... That's you and me. For how long will you be gone? I don't know. Why don't you know? It's not up to me to decide. It's up to whom to decide? Look, Suzanne, I don't want to go either. Then don't go. - Hi! - Hi! Thanks. Here, dad. You woke up early. You live the big life. What am I to say to the boss? Can you stop daydreaming for a moment? There's Charlie, there's school... You have nothing to say? You always cover your sister's stupidities. Is it that guy you go out with? Hold on, I haven't finished. I haven't finished. Where are you going? - Tell me where. - To bed. Come back here, I have not finished! -Come here! - Stop it! I've had it! I can't take it any more! - You're coming with me! - You're crazy! I'm not crazy! I won't let you. It's that simple. Pack your stuff by the end of the week. On Sunday, you come home. Monday, you go back to work. Sorry. We woke you up. I was afraid you'd be gone. - That's really nice of you. I am very sorry. - It's okay. Room 38, please. For Charlie. Do not worry. Yeah, the young couple. Oh, yeah? When? Okay. Thank you. - Where to? - Orleans. - Come in. I'll get you close to it. - Thanks. Can I ask your age? I am 25. Why are you going to Orleans in the middle of the week? There's a Sound System during the weekend. It's music. You started early. Three days to go to Orleans... What's your job? This and that. Have you ever seen her? No. Your daughter? Her name is Suzanne. When did you last see her? It's almost been a year. No, I've never seen her. Keep it, I have others. Photocopies. - Hi. - Hi. Did you have a nice trip? Train packed? Yeah. They say my absences upset him. This month... I have seen the social worker twice. These psychologists drive him crazy. I'm sure of it. You two spent many nights alone. You weren't afraid. You knew, if there was a problem... We were two. And also there were Andre and Sylvie. It's not the same. ''Mmh! I want... to taste this apple, says Pierre.'' Hey, you read well! You have made progress. Aren't you tired? - Can I sleep with you, dad? - You are too old now. Watch out, my back! - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Sweet dreams. To the left. How many in each cell? One? - And how is she? - She is nice. I will be the one... to represent you in court. How many years am I facing? Too soon to say. It depends on the trial procedure. Your criminal record is clear. Have you ever been on trial? Never. This is positive. I also... ...contacted your family. They are fine. I don't think your dad will come right now to see you. He is a bit angry, if I may say so. He needs time, to adapt to the news. But you can count on your sister. She can't wait to see you. I asked for visiting rights. We will soon know... And my son, Charlie? Charlie is fine. He does no longer live with your father. He has been given to an adoptive family. By court order. Your father was absent too often. - Because of his job. - What? What's going on with Charlie? For the time being, he is with an adoptive family, because... he couldn't stay with your father. He is fine, the family is taking good care of him. Do not worry. You will be able to see hime again... Excuse me. I am sorry. Everything will be fine, do not worry. Morel against Merevsky, Case Number 2005-18-26.
