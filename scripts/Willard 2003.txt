What were you doing down there? You, uh, said there were rats. Well, did you see them? Well...there aren't any rats. There are. All our neighbors moving away... and all these new people remodelling the houses. They're stirring up rats. Well...have you been to the basement? No. You know I can't. I know they're there. I can smell them. All my life I could smell mice. Smell...mice? And hear them. Don't you hear them down there? It's--it's just the wind. There aren't any rats. Come in here. Hmm? Come in here. I'm sorry I've been such a bad mother to you. Well, you've--you've been a... Well, you are... a wonderful mother. It's my fault your life was wasted. Willard. What an awful name--Willard. Maybe if you had a stronger name... that Frank Martin wouldn't push you around... or maybe you'd have found a girlfriend... if you had a more handsome name-- Mark or Kyle or... Clark. Willard, from now on, your name's Clark. Good night, Clark. Pardon me. That you? Sorry. They told me to sit here. Willard, he wants to see you. Oh. Well, um... Ms. Leach, it seems that someone... this girl, is sitting at my desk. Maybe that's why he wants to see you. OK. Hey. Pay attention. Yeah? Who's that at your desk out there, Willard? I--I don't know her. Sit. Who did you say that was at your desk out there, Willard? I--l--I don't know her. Well, you should know, because it's your fault she's there. You've fallen at least a week behind... processing the purchase orders. You know, when that happens, Willard... everything comes to a standstill-- my salespeople up on the floor... shipping, receiving, inventory. Everybody's standing around... with their thumbs up their asses... because you have allowed the purchase orders... to bottleneck at your desk. Your father built this company, Willard. Hell, your family name is still out there... on the side of the building-- "Martin Stiles Manufacturing." Ah, hell, it just seems to me like... that alone would make you take... a little more pride in your work. Well, l... Oh, my mother is sick. I see. So, it's your mother's fault that you've fallen behind? Willard, I'm an old friend of the family. Hell, I've known your mother since before you were born. She's a fine lady, and she deserves to be kept comfortable. Your dad was like a father to me. And I promised him that I would always... Look after you and your mother... and as long as she was alive, you'd have a job right here. And in keeping with that promise... I must insist that you find... a good rest-care facility for mom. We can't afford that. But, hell, I guess you could always sell the house. Here's an idea--I'd tear it down and build apartments on it. I'm sorry, Mr. Martin. I'll--I'll--I'll... I'll catch up. I'll stay late. Oh, yeah. You would love that, wouldn't you, Willard? Suck up on more overtime than it even costs me for a temp. You'll catch up, all right, asshole... and you'll catch up on your own damn time! There's one thing that you will never understand, Willard-- business is a rat race. Promise or no promise, I will not allow myself... to be devoured by all of those other rats because of you! Clark! What is it? What is it? Shh, shh, shh. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Here we go. What was all that noise? Rats? No. A bird got stuck in the house somehow, and I let it out. It's all right now, so go back to bed. What are you doing in there? I'm going potty. You've been in there a long time. I'm not feeling well, mom. Is it loose or hard? I'm OK. I'm OK. So just--just go to bed. Let me see. I'm still your mother. Clark! Clark! You should be in bed. You're feverish. I get afraid, Clark. Your father was in that bathroom late that night. Yes, I know. I'm never going to do anything like that. What is that on your hand? It's--it's soap. It's cooking oil. Oh, Willard, you're too old for that. When will you find yourself a girl? Well, other than getting caught in the trap... you seem pretty--pretty smart. You should be called... Socrates. What do you think? Yeah? All right. Socrates. Whoa. Like it in here? Oh. Where are you going? Bye, Socrates. Say hello to your family. You're reunited with your brother and sister and mom. Look. Look, everybody. Food. Food for everybody. There you go. Very good. Bye. Socrates... I will never let anyone harm you ever. I promise. I promise. I promise. Martin, I have to cover your damn car every day. "Cover my car. Cover my car." Ugh! Do you like my new S-55, Willard? My new car. My new Mercedes. I saw you drooling over it. Oh. Uh, yes, Mr. Martin. It's... Do you know why I have that car? I'm driving that 350-horsepower, V-8 masterpiece... for you and your fellow employees. You see, buyers feel a sense of security... when they can see proof... that they're dealing with a successful man. So, when I whip into that parking lot behind the wheel... of my brand-new Mercedes AMG-class... they'll buy from us over the slob in the Jaguar S-type. Do you know why I can afford to plunk down 90,000 bucks... for that little edge over the competition, Willard? Because I'm a successful man! Because I have never been late for work a day in my life! Because when I come to work, I don't show up... in one of my dead father's cheap suits! Because I have never given my boss such grief. Maybe it wouldn't hurt you to find out what pleases me! Are you OK? Hi, Socrates. It's been a bad day. Tear it, Socrates. All right... you teach them. They listen to you, Socrates. Tear it. Tear it. Tear it up. Jeez. You're big. Big Ben. Do you know him, Socrates? Ben, this looks like the beginning... of a beautiful friendship. Tear it. Tear it. Tear it. OK, everybody, that was really good. Speed. Speed. Very good. Rope...up. Tear it. You go down there. Go on now. Down. Down. Tear it. In. Still. Out. One week! You've been late for so many hours... that it equals an entire week! Mr. Martin, l--I'm sorry. I want my week back. I've discussed it with counsel. I may not be able to fire you, Willard... but, by God, it is well within my rights to administer... physical disciplinary reprimand! I know that you must be tired of this excuse... but what can I do? My mother is sick. You don't give a shit about your mother! If you did, you'd show up for work on time... because now look what's happened. You're out a week's pay. Oh, you don't like that. Then quit. Act like a man for once in your life and just quit! You're a slimy, pukey piece of shit! You wouldn't make a pimple on my grandmother's tush! Willard. In. In. No! Ben, no. If you get in, nobody else will be able to fit. In. Be careful, stupid. We're not making a bed here. All available units, please respond immediately. Out. Door. Tear it. Tires. Tear it. Ben, I told you to stay. You--you won't fit. What the hell is that? You left the washer in the garage... running again, didn't you? In! In! Come on. Come on. Anybody out there? Is someone out there in the garage? Oh, shit! Look at that! Somebody got in here and slashed my tires! Damn! Who's out here? Yeah, you better run! You don't mess with a man's brand-new car like that! Run, and you'll only die tired! You better run faster... because if I catch you, you are dead meat! Quiet! Go home! Do you want to see what's in the bags... you stupid little dog? The look on his face. Imagine, all four of his tires. Do you know what a set of those tires run? Insurance will cover it. But insurance won't cover how pissed off he's gonna be. Hey, what's up? Someone broke into Martin's garage last night... slashed his tires and peed on the floor! Morning, Cat. You look very nice today. Wow. Someone--someone urinated on the floor? No, no, no. You know, what happened-- when Martin goes in his garage... and sees his tires, he pissed his pants... and blamed it on the guy that did it. Do you think that's funny, Fox? Ahem. Good morning, Mr. Martin. Is everything OK? No, everything is not OK. How would you like it if some maniac... invaded the privacy of your home... and scared the dog shit out of your wife... and then you had to lose an entire night's sleep... because you're dealing with the cops? Knowing that that perverted sicko has control... over you and your family's peace of mind? For Jesus and Christ, for how long? How long will it last? No, I'm not all right! This morning, I rode the subway. Well, Mr. Fox, how would you like that? No, sir, I wouldn't like that at all. I didn't think you would. Barbara, I need a foot massage. Oh, that's so good. That's so good. Foods. Foods. We, um... we're running out of room. I'm very sorry about this... but I can't--I can't feed you anymore. I can't afford it. You're going to have to find a new place to live. Go find somewhere more comfortable. I wish that they didn't have to... but all good things must come to an end. Follow Ben. He will find a new place for you. He will take care of you. Won't you, Ben? You're the leader... after Socrates. Good night, Ben. You're not going anywhere, Socrates. You'll always be with me. I hate everyone but you. Let's go to bed. Ben, I told you. You can't come upstairs. Now, it's only Socrates, not you. Oh, Socrates. Aah! Don't touch me! You're getting rid of me. Mom, l--I love you. I heard you! "All good things must come to an end." No, l--I love you more than anything in the world. You don't love me! You won't feed me! I hate you! You need to go to the hospital. What if mom sees you? No. Mom? Mom? Off. Off. Off. Off. Off. Off. Off. Down! Down! In the basement! Down! Down! Down! In the basement! Down! You think you're funny? You think you're smart? Socrates, he's smart. He knows that they're going to have to come... and they're going to have to take her away... and then they'll come, and they'll take me away... and then they'll come, and they'll take you away! Hi. She's my mother. I love her. And I'll miss her. I already miss her. But, Socrates... if you ever died, l... You're the only friend that I've ever had. Well... at least you're with father again. I have a friend. See? He wants to say good-bye to you. Say good-bye, Socrates. That's good. Willard. In. Willard, are you all right? Yeah. I didn't mean to upset you. You didn't have to come here. Well, we didn't hear from you... and I wanted to make sure that you were OK. Uh, and I want to let you know that... you have a friend. Willard Stiles, I am Joseph Carter. I'm an attorney with Montgomery and Glitt... the trustees of your mother's estate. I've been trying to reach you, but you don't answer the phone. May I have a moment with Willard, please? Do you mind if I check on you after work... and make sure that you're OK? Oh, l--thanks. That's OK. I'll be OK, Cat. Willard, I have some news... I don't know if you're aware of or prepared for. Your parents had been living off an account... they had originally set up for your future. It was intended to be yours upon their passing. However, your father's death left debts... that even Mr. Martin's buyout did not completely relieve. In fact, there remains pending litigation... on some unsettled debts. Well... it's--it's still my house. Your mother refinanced the house... after your father's death. -ln fact, we still owe-- -"We"? It's my house. We can declare bankruptcy. We can sell the house. -It's my house! -Yes, of course. You grew up there. It's your home. -But it's the bank's house. -It's my house! There's no need for a single man... to be living in such a large house, Willard. Sell it. Why do I have to pay for what things my parents did? The money can help you start over. "Start over"? I'm almost done! Willard, look. You have no choice-- If I have no choice, why did you even come here? Why did you even bother telling me? Do you get off on telling people... that they have no control over their lives? That I have no money, no home, and it's not even my fault? Willard, this is not the time nor place. Now, you think about it. Then, please, you have to contact me. This is the only chance you have... to take control of your own life. Thank you. Socrates. Ben! Willard, it's Cathryn. Answer the door. I saw you walk in. -Oh, hi. -Hi. I'm just on my way out. I have some stuff that I have to do at the cemetery. Oh, well, this might not be the best time, Willard... but please don't take this the wrong way. You looked so lonely at your mother's service... and I remember how devastated I was... you know, when my mother died. And the only thing that helped me through... was...her mother. This is Scully. She'll make a great friend, and she'll keep you company. Oh. I don't know what to say. I... I can't accept Scully. See? She likes you. Well... Why don't you hold her? Just take her. Just hold her. Really, I can't. I'm sorry. -Just take her. -OK. Well... I'm really late, and... Do you think it's OK if I just put her inside? -Sure. She's potty-trained. -Oh, good. Good. Socrates. It's OK. It's OK. I wasn't... really trying to hurt him. I know. You're trying to keep the peace... but he has to learn... I am the boss. It's back to work, Socrates. Ben, out. OK, Ben... just because Socrates says it's OK. Here we go. Here we go. Am I reading this correctly? "Mr. Stiles, it is our regret to inform you... "your position has been terminated. "Enclosed please find two weeks' severance. "Your service is appreciated. "Frank Martin." He's firing you. But I thought he couldn't fire you. Willard. Hey. Hey! This whole thing is just one big misunderstanding. I'll make it up to you, though. I'm gonna take you to the Jets-Dolphins game. -How does that sound? -What? Feels like this office could use a little holiday cheer. Cathryn, go dig out the Christmas decorations. They're in the back storeroom. The key's in Willard's desk somewhere. Talk it over with Rosie and let me know. I'll be right here at the office working late tonight. Christmas bonus time, you know. Mrs. Leach, found the keys... but you can dig out your own holiday cheer... and then you can shove it up your ass with a big ho-ho-ho. -I quit. -Bye-bye. How could you? What part of "You're fired" don't you understand? -My father! -ls dead. Been dead. And now your mama's dead, too. He started this company! It's my family's company! No. My company. Been my company... and I don't want you around it anymore. Why in the hell are you even still here? You hate it here. I hate you being here. You're going nowhere here. Mommy and daddy are dead. Get over it and get on with your life. The terms of your purchase contract-- they strictly state that you are not allowed to-- Sue me. Get you a goddamn lawyer and sue me. You'll win. Go down today and hire yourself a $250-an-hour lawyer. Sue me. My $400-an-hour lawyer... will tie it up in the courts until I die. So, what? 10, 15, 20 years from now, you'll win. You know I cannot afford that! You know that! Need money? Make me an offer on the house. Don't give me that face, Willard. I buy the house, you have money. You can go buy yourself a very nice clean used car... move someplace where you'll be happy... get a job, a girlfriend. Jeez, you'll be so damn happy you won't want to sue me. All right... I'll sell you the house. But, please, please, please let me keep my job! Please! Please let me keep my job. Please. What in the hell is going on now? A rat! A rat in here! Oh! It's a rat! Oh, my God! Rat! Look out! There's a white rat... and it is the size of a dog--I mean, huge dog. Over there, behind the Christmas lights. See him? Where? I don't see any mouse. No. Up there, you idiot. Up there! I think your wild-ass imagination... is kind of getting away with you. He's up higher. There he is. No! Walt, this is Mickey. I'm coming to join you. Yeah. What's the matter, tiger? Can't take a little blood? Ha ha ha ha! Finders keepers. Nice work, Mr. Martin. Yeah, good one, sir. He expects me to clean that up? I'll do it. Thanks. What could I do? What could I do? What could I do? What could I do? What could I do? What could I do? What could I do? What can I do? What can we do? In. In. That's it. We can't fit any more. The rest of you are going to have to wait here. Ben and I will be back later. Right, Ben? Oh, Jesus. Ooh...I like that. Ooh, look at you. Oh, my God. Look at all the rats. Yes. Look at the rats. We've come to see you. We? They'll do anything I tell them. Well, then tell them to get the fuck out of my office! Sit down. Now, you listen to me, Willard. Sit down! What the hell's wrong with you? Mr. Martin, you stole this business from my father. It killed him, and it killed my mother. And now you're trying to kill me. No. That's-- You never let me alone for a minute. You made a fool of me in front of everybody. And now you're trying to take my house. You made me hate myself. I thought a lot about it... hating myself. Well, right now... at this moment... I like myself. You killed Socrates! Who the hell is Socrates? He was the only friend... I ever had! What's the matter, tiger? Afraid of a little blood? Tear him up. Good-bye, Ben. Food. Food. -I think I hear footsteps. -Yeah. -Let's look around back. -OK. Willard? It's Cathryn. I've been calling you all day. Did you hear? Martin's dead. They called from the office. The details are weird. All kinds of rumors... that he was murdered or attacked by animals. I'm hungry. Could we get something to eat? Right now? Let me get my coat. Just a second. Could I use the restroom? Cathryn? In here. Sorry. I had to go so bad, and you flew off somewhere. We need to go. Shit. I must have run over something. -There he is. -You sure that's him? Yeah. Get in the car. I'll call triple-A. I've got a cell phone. Mr. Stiles, police. Open the door, please, sir. Can you please tell me what this is about? Willard! Open the door, Willard! I want to help you! Willard! Willard! Open the door, Willard! Let me in! What's going on in there? I hear him going around back. Stiles. Stiles! I'm sorry, Ben. I... I'm sorry that I left you. I got scared... and so l--I came back here. It's all over, Ben. You can live anywhere. You can go anywhere. I have nowhere. Who's he talking to? There was nothing that I could do about Socrates. But...we got him back. We got Mr. Martin back together. This guy's nuts. We should just call Bellevue. It's all over, Ben. So just...go! Go away! Whoa! It's not just Bellevue. We've got to call the health department exterminators. You see that? Oh, man. Let's go. Do you want some food? I'll give you some food, Ben. I'll give you all the food that I have... if you'll just go away. Do you want food? No. No, no, Ben. It's food. It's just food. Whatever food is in the bag is yours. Ah! That's it for you, Ben! I hate you! I loved Socrates, but I hate you! I'm not setting foot in there. There's, like, a thousand rats. Ma'am, you want to get eaten alive? Martin. If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator. Cathryn, help! Help! Cathryn! Cathryn. Ben. I thought we were friends. Food's here. Food. Look, Stiles, you've got to eat. You might be out of your mind, but your body's staying here. Eat. Come on. We got some nice chicken... some mashed potatoes... got a sourdough roll. Hey, look. We got a piece of cheese. That's what the mice eat, isn't it? OK, rat boy. Look, I'm gonna leave it here. You can do whatever you want with it. Hi. Shh. I know you're hungry, but we have to wait. Our time will come. Let's not let them know that you've come back to me. We have to sit here... and wait-- wait... quietly. Quiet as a mouse.
