I can go from here. - Sis! - Sis! - Come with me. - I'll carry this for you. Thanks. Head Mother! Soo-ah is here! - Hi. - Put these on. That's not a toy. Give it to me. Now, go back in and get ready for your talent show. Yes! Hungry? Hold on. I'll go check on dinner. Take your time. I wanna look around the place. Okay, then. I'll call you when it's ready. Hey! KIM Dong-hyun! Come here! Catch me if you can! Why you! You're in big trouble. Okay! L give up! This is called, UItra-cane. Things that canes can't detect... This warns you by vibrations. Press this and it'll vibrate stronger for close things... ...and weaker for things further away. - Feel it? - It's great. I'm sure it'll come in handy when you go back to school. Did you already go? What did they say? You can't? An impairment in the heart is the real problem. Not being able to see is nothing. Daughter! Cheer up! I'm fine. Did you ask me to come for this? Well... The boys stopped by today. Who? They're having another show in memory of Dong-hyun. That's why you told me to come? They're hoping you'd come this year. I'd like that, too. If it's cuz of that, I can't take this. No, this has nothing to do with the boys. How can I go there? They lost a friend cuz of me. That wasn't your fauIt! It was an accident. Of course it was my fauIt! I handcuffed him! Soo-ah! Soo-ah! iKIM DONG-HYUN Sis! Are you okay? I'm fine. I can get up by myself. Wait! I'll drive you. No. I can go by myself. Don't go around by yourself at night. To me... ...night and day are the same. Don't follow me! If you do, I'll never come again. I called for a ride from Ilsan. Is the driver on his way? There are many reservations cuz of the rain. Sorry, it'll take a couple of hours. I see. Thank you. Answer call. Hello? Where are you? Mom will come get... Slide and select option. Where are you headed? - Jingwan-dong, Seoul. - Thank you. Thank you. Are you visually impaired? Yes. I damaged my retina in an accident. Sorry to hear that. - Is this a deluxe taxi? - What? The seat feels like real leather. If it is, I don't have enough for the fare. It's okay. I'll charge you regular fare. Thank you. Are you cold? Would you like the heater on more? Thank you. Was there a man on before me? Why? I smell sterilizer. He probably works in a hospital. How do you know? Women wear make-up, so it's hard to tell. But men carry the smell of their workplace. And they don't wear perfume much. Let me air it out. It's raining! Don't open it! I'm sorry. See, you got wet. Hold on. Dry yourself. And have some of this. - It's coffee. - Ok. Do you want it opened? It's okay. I'll drink it later. Give it to me. I'll open it. I can do it. No, I'll open it for you. It's okay, really. I'll do it. Give it to me! Was it an accident? What did you hit? It's nothing. Just a dog. - A dong? - Yes. It's nothing. Don't worry and get in. How big was it that the front window cracked? It's a dog, really. Let's go. Wait. What are you doing? It's raining. Get in! What are you doing? Come on! Get in! Let me go! Get in, now! - Give me your ID. - I did! - It happened while in a cab? - Yes. Did you see the taxi? No, I didn't see it. What time was the accident? About 11:40 or so. Shouldn't the area be inspected? It was definitely a hit-and-run. But the driver said he hit a dog. I heard a woman's moan. Dogs moan, too. She wouldn't make things up. Yes, of course. Then, at least... secure the scene. Can't you do anything right? Captain! It slopes down. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Please, don't kill me. MIN Soo-ah I know. I got punished for leaving you alone. I'm sorry. There. Okay! Okay! I won't do it again. What's wrong? Seul-ki? What is it? Who is it? Who is it? It's the police. Open the door, ma'am. Are you Ms. MIN Soo-ah? Yes, I am. - She can't see. - Let's take her to the station. Is there a problem? You reported a case last night, right? Someone went missing in the area. Her name's LEE Min-ju. Come with us to the station. Man! Why me of all people? Stop yappin'. She can't see! How can she tell if the cab hit a dog or a person! Just take the case. Making me take flop cases! You brought me here for this? Hey, Busan man! Stop it. You're dang noisy. Eat up, folks. Just make up a report, then send her off, fool! But, Captain! This is bonkers! Miss? State your name. I was asked that three times. Oh, it's right here. I was just assigned to the case. So, can we go on with it? I'm on it, Miss. Name... - Ms. Min Soo-ah. - Yes. You witnessed a hit-and... Ah... I mean... - You feIt a hit-and-run? - Yes. Address, please. Jingwan-dong, Seoul. How'd she know he hit a person? If it was a dog, it would've just bounced off the front. Your hearing is great. The rest of your address? Hana Apartment #205 Well then... We're done. Was I brought here just to be asked about my name and address? If something comes up, I'll be in touch. What if... I wasn't blind? What would you ask? Well, I would ask things like... Did you see the car? The plate number? How old did the driver look? Early to mid-forties and around 176cm in height. With a stocky physique. You're in the late thirties, right? Yes... How'd you know? And you're around 170cm? Slim physique? Damn! Can you see me? I can tell the height from the voice... the physique by the reverberation, and age by intuition. People think I'm in the forties or fifties. I can know many things though I can't see. Like the fact you ate black bean noodles for lunch. Then... Let's try this. Tell me everything you heard. You were riding in a deluxe cab when an accident occurred. But the driver said he hit a dog? L heard the car body and taxi cap breaking. It can't be a dog. The area of the impact was too big. The victim was placed in the trunk. So, he Lied and said it's a dog, cuz you can't see? Right. He wanted to get rid of the evidence. Wait. I think a man who practices medicine was on before me. Did the driver say that? No. As soon as I got on... It smelled like sterilizer. Anything else you remember? The driver was probably left-handed. Left-handed? His watch was on his right hand. People usually put watches on the weaker hand. That's right! Start by looking for left-handed, deluxe taxi drivers. LOOKING FOR A HIT-AND-RUN WITNESS REWARD FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE ARRES What's this? DELUXE TAXI It's so cold, isn't it? Yes, it is. Cigarette? By the way... Anyone here works around Ilsan? - Ilsan? - KIM does. - KIM! - Why? You go to Ilsan often. - Ilsan? - Yeah. Just on the weekends. Ilsan's a jackpot on weekends with nightclubs and concerts. Hold on. Wait here. Inspector CHO Hee-bong speaking. What? You're a witness? Really? Ilsan on the night of February 11th? Do you remember the make of the car? What? I'm telling you! It wasn't a cab! I'll say it again. There ain't no way it was a cab! I was in it. Of course I'd know. You don't know shit. Kid talks with such class. How ignorant! What? I wasn't talking about you. It's the bastard who sold a video phone to a blind person. Look. Visually impaired people know more than you think. I can tell if the car I was in was a taxi or not. So, what you're saying is... There's no way it was a cab? No way in hell. Think carefully. It was raining and dark, you could've seen wrong. No way! I saw it clearly with these eyes! It was a foreign car! Then, why don't you know the make of the car? Look, Mister. Are you a foreigner? You're not making sense. Just answer the question. Anyway, it wasn't a domestic car. This is bonkers! Let's say you're right. Then, why didn't you report it? Why didn't you, when you clearly saw it? Yeah, kid! He put her in the car. I thought he'd go to the hospital. Where in the car? The backseat. I was in the backseat. The victim was put in the trunk. Tell the truth. To be honest... I didn't see everything. Is it cuz of the reward money? What? Hey, kid! Did you see it? You didn't, did you! What the hell! Come here! Why you little! - Come here! - Get away! Get out! Let me go! How dare you come here and talk shi... - I mean lie! - Let go! Why you! Oh, hi! You're Soo-ah, right? I'm Mi-hyun. Hi, Mi-hyun. You work here? No, I'm on patrol. I stopped by for something. Let go! She didn't even see it! But I saw with my own eyes! Really! Damn it! Come here, you! Damn kid. Damn kid just took up our time. I thought it was weird. The way you gave your statement was good. - Please... - Keep studying. You'd do well in the monitoring team. A blind cop? I can't even see the culprit. You've got a lot to learn. Some cops chase culprits without knowing their faces. And some culprits run knowing the cops' faces. So, we're pretty much the same. Question is, who gives more heart! Crime occurs between people all around us. So, if you give all you got, anything's possible! I strongly believe that! Whoa, that was pretty good. CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY Come with us. You're drunk. - Let go! - Let her go. Seul-ki! Answer call. Hello? Hello? I'm Listening. Hello? Hello? Yes? No, it's okay. It's urgent? No problem. I'll be right there. After February 11th... Were any deluxe taxis repaired? No major accidents. - What about that? - Just a dent like this. - That one? - That's in for an oil change. Call me when a cab comes to fix the front. Yes, sir. Soo-ah? Take this. It's a voice recorder. Do you hear it? Had your front bumper fixed? No. It's not him. Have you worked around Ilsan, recently? - No. - Wait! Know anyone who had the front bumper fixed? Nope! Sorry. Hungry? Here. It's a red bean bun. There's none for you. Bang! Bang! It's not him. It takes 20 years to qualify as a deluxe cab driver. If he's in his 40s, it must be less than 5 years. Right. Someone scratched past my parked cab. That's why L got it fixed. Why'd you fix the on-board record box? The tachometer? The union told us to, Long ago. It's not him. He was the last one today. His voice wasn't hoarse. But this man probably has lung problems. You know things like that? A little. Then, what about me? I don't sense it from you. But you should quit smoking. Take that, bastards! You seem lost in thought. I was thinking about that kid. I can't get him off my mind. Forget it. There are tons of kids like that. But... How'd you know I smoked? I didn't smoke in front of you on purpose. How do you think? By the sound of my voice? I can smell it. Caught red handed. It smells like a factory in here. You should cut down. But this is a new car. It's raining! Don't open it! Did I startle you? That's cuz it's a hatchback. A hatchback? Yes. It's a type of car. The backseat and trunk on regular cars are separated. But this is wide open. With the lower wind drag, it rattles if you open a window. That sound's cuz of the car's type? You catch on quick. That taxi made this sound, too. What? It must be a hatchback. There are no hatchback cabs. L was in it. Of course I'd know. It's not a cab! It was a foreign car! Here. Good work. - Goodnight, then. - Bye. What are you doing? I just got off work. No new bike, man. The reward's not happening. What? The hell I know! Know what they said to me? That I came just for the money. Shit. The kid's still on the phone. Go look at the placard. I totaled it! Then, I'll demand proof, like they did. It was definitely a foreign car. If I knew that car, I would told 'em. Forget it. I'm hanging up. Later! Damn! The person you have called cannot be reached... The kid's not answering on purpose. Shit. It's cold! You go out! He doesn't even take out the damn garbage. I'll try calling him, then. It's 01065573002. If he doesn't answer, let's go to his house. I heard he lives alone around here. Honey! Help! What's happening? There's an ambulance. Someone must be hurt. Wait! That's him! - It's Gi-sub! - What? Wait! Hold on! I'm a cop. What happened to him? He was down with his head bleeding. Are you his guardian? Yes. Come with us. Soo-ah, let's go! - Doctor? - Yes? Is his head okay? Luckily, there's no hemorrhage. The thicker this white line is the better the bone density. He has a very thick skull. It's very rare. No fractures, either. Pretty amazing. You should watch what he eats though. He has severe nutrient deficiency symptoms. Nutrient deficiency? His treatments are done. You can take him home when he wakes up. Thank you. Sure. - Take care. - Bye. You should've seen the x-ray. That kid's got a stone helmet in his head. But, if it wasn't a cab... Why'd he let you on? He offered me coffee. - In a bottle... - What? He practically forced me to drink it. Why're you telling me that now! I didn't think it was strange. I thought it was a deluxe cab. Soo-ah, wait here for a sec. Captain! It's Hee-bong. After a thorough analysis on this case... The culprit hit LEE Min-ju with his foreign car. Then, he put her in the trunk and ran off. And he gave coffee to the victims. I think there's some connection to the abduction cases - these days... - Damn! Don't investigate on speculations. Write a novel why don't ya? And why bring in other cases to this one! If you offer coffee, you're a kidnapper? Then, everyone at Starbucks is a kidnapper? There's no proof he added something to it! - But, sir! - Captain? The Chief wants a progress report. Okay. But, Captain! Wait! I get ya. But investigate it more. That's why they put you on this case. Agent Busan Gull. Squawk! You can do it, man! - Let's go. - Yes, sir. Captain! Clean up, will ya? This is bonkers! I saw it with my own eyes! I'm serious! Sis! You sure someone doesn't want revenge on ya? Of course not! Why do you keep treatin' me like a bad kid! Then, why would someone try to smash your head? Some guy walks past and thinks let's break that kid's skull! Is that it? I'm dying to know why he chased me and hit me more! Fine then. That's that. You vandalized the placard, didn't you? What are you talking about? Got proof that I did it? I told you it wasn't a cab. Can't you investigate right? Are you out of your mind? Are you okay? Don't touch me! You lame... Show some respect! She took care of you all night! Whatever. After looking at me like crap and insisting it's a cab. Why worry about me now? Shit. Where're ya going? Can't I go to the bathroom? What are you saying? Soo-ah. Ms. MIN? You're doing great. It was crazy from the start. A blind witness... Look. Cases are filled with crazy things. Nothing makes sense these days! I think it'll be best for me to stop here. Damn! We know it wasn't a cab. We'll go from there! I'm sorry. This is bonkers! Looking good! - The uniform Looks great. - You said it. That's my sister! Congratulations sis! I'm reporting from police academy admission ceremony. - Ms. MIN Soo-ah? - Yes? Your comments, please? L promise to become a great police officer! - Go Soo-ah! - Yeah! Say something, Mom. Ok. I'll be a great police officer's mom! And I'll be a great police officer's brother! I'm god damn handsome! L kept my words, so... Answer call. Hello? Hello? MIN Soo-ah? Yes. Who's speaking? How's the kid doing? What? I don't under... Not finishing your sentence? - What do you want? - What do you think? - If you turn yourself in now... - Then what? As an extenuating circumstance, your sentence will become less. What good will that do? Will the dead bitch come back to life? Listen. Turn yourself in. If you don't, you'll live in fear all your life. Hello? Crazy bitch. You're the scared one, not me. You can't see me. But I'm watching you! Fact is... You can't see me. But I can see you. It's not the first time you killed someone, is it! Could be the Last though. If you and that kid stay quiet. Don't pull anything. Or I'll kill you. Hello? Hello? Calling Inspector CHO. Soo-Ah Seul-ki? Seul-ki! Why'd you bring me this to wear? That's my favorite jacket. Shouldn't you stay here longer? Forget it. I can't stand it. - Where's my battery? - Right. The hell? Stay there until Inspector CHO comes? Soo-ah. Thinks she can tell me what to do? Gi-sub! Are you here? She's looking for you. - He's here. Hey! Wait, Gi-sub! - Listen to me. - Let go! What's with you! Just stay here till Inspector CHO comes, please? Why should I! You'll be in danger. That man's... I think it's more dangerous to be with you. I'm not joking. He's after you! Think of me as a sister and listen. Damn... I don't have a lame sister! Let go! I'm out of this case! So, don't come looking for me. Hey, isn't that the girl? The one with the dog? Life's such a bore. Let's go for drinks. At this hour? Where are you going! - Come back! - Next is the last train! Hello? Don't say anything. Just Listen! Gi-sub? Shit! L said, just Listen! I'll call back on video phone. Put your earphones on. What's going on? Just do it! Listen carefully. I think that bastard's on the train. So, show me the area around you. Wait! Go back Left. He's sitting in front of you. The train's pretty much empty. So, get off at the next stop. TRAIN HAS LEF THE PREVIOUS STATION This stop is Sam-song. The doors are on your right. Opening screen doors. Closing screen doors. Shit! No one's there. Act normal and walk slowly. Call for help, now! There's someone up front! Walk quietly. Hello? Hello? What's going on? Hello? Say something! Hello? Do you hear me? Say something! Hello? Seul-ki! Run! Hello? Hello? I won't hang up. Talk when you can, okay? - Gi-sub! - I'm here! - Which way? - Go left! Go right! Go left! Start running! Keep running till I say stop! What's happening? Seul-ki! Seul-ki! Seul-ki! Hurry! Get up! Seul-ki! Listen to me! Seul-ki! Follow me! Wait! Stop! Go back a little. Go right. Yes, there! Keep running! There's an elevator right beside you. Hello? Hello! Damn dog! Oh god! Is she dead? It's Propofol. Propofol? It's a short-acting sedation agent. Long-term use can lead to addiction. It's not something that anyone can get, right? Of course. Only hospitals are allowed to carry it. Hospitals? As soon as L got on, it smelled Like sterilizer. Do many places use this? All hospitals. But mostly private hospitals or clinics use it more. Like which ones? Plastic surgeons, dermatologists and OB-GYN Seul-ki! She's awake. Ms. MIN? Are you okay? Where am I? The hospital. Where's Seul-ki? My guide dog was with me. Actually... Soo-ah! Calm down. - Inspector CHO? - Yes. Where's Seul-ki? Did you see her? We found her, but... She's gone. Far away... Seul-ki... Seul-ki... Seul-ki... Seul-ki... Police station. We're doing our best to find her. You! Get a list of suspects ready. You! Find out about the Propofol! Captain? We found out CHOI Jung-yeon's last call was to MIN Soo-ah. Okay. Go break the news to her family. Yes, sir. We believe she's been abducted. Are you okay? How long till the composite? By tomorrow at the latest, sir. Why's it taking so long? How's it going? I knew I could count on you. - Need anything? - No, sir! Lighten up. That's the car! Captain! - What is it? - It's Peugeot. They should have a list of the buyers. Soo-ah! Don't worry and just leave it to us. We found the make of the car. We'll get him soon. I'll call you if I need to ask anything. Okay. Inspector? Can I go home now? Why? Want your head smashed again? It's not that. Stay with Soo-ah till we catch the culprit. Inspector KIM will stay with you. So, don't pull anything. - Got it? - Okay! Stop watching TV on the job, will ya! - Keep them safe. - Don't worry.
