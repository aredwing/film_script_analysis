In the Name of the Father... ... and the Son... and the Holy Spirit... Amen. This is the blood of Christ, which he gave for our sins. Body of Christ. Body of Christ. Hi. At the end of the way, there will be a light. And the light is me. Here. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. That's good. Give me the gun. Get him out. Here. The girl came to collect the family's payment a few times now. Mm hmm. Normally the mother does that. And the last time she came, she looked bad. I mean, really bad actually. The payments are only for the kids and the mother. Where is the father? Right? She's an investigator. She believes something happened to that girl, you know, on the farm. Investigator? You mean like the law? Is there something I should know about? How do I know? In the Name of the Father... ...and the Son... and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Come on. Corre. I'll find you, okay? Go hide. Hide. Get out of the way. - What the fuck, don't worry! - No! What? Relax. Get up. Get up. Run! It's okay.
