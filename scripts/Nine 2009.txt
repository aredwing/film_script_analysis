You kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera, Your film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it, But then it dies again, buried in film cans. Mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room... a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when finally an audience sits in the dark if you're lucky, very lucky, and sometimes I've been lucky the dream flickers back to life again. That's why I'm secretive. So, what's your favorite pasta? Finally, a serious question. "NINE" Transcribed by: anreith [inSanos] lostmaniac [inSanos] Cinecitta Film Studios Rome 1965 Good luck, Maestro. Maestro, maestro, maestro. Maestro Contini How do you begin? How do you begin this thing? Page one, page one, page one... Page nothing. - Guido, you're here. - Buongiorno, Dante. I've been looking for you all over the place. The set's coming along, eh? - How are you? - Bene, grazie, bene. My God you look terrible. Better go to makeup. Forgot you've got a press conference? - He has no tie. - Yes, makeup and wardrobe. - Signor Contini, Im Fausto. - He's counting cost. The bank wants him here. - Signor Contini. - Dont speak to him, I speak to him. Okay. I have some questions for Signor Contini. You all have questions for Signor Contini. Yes, but please. I think it's customary for there to be an approved script and budget before filming commence. - Is he going to follow us? - It's not my intention to be difficult, I'm a huge admirer of Maestro Contini's movies your early films are... everybody loves them. And I consider it a great honor for me to be here. But nonetheless, I need a script and a budget - Where do you want your messages? - On my desk. - There's no room on your desk. - Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo so. Ciao, Paula. Get me a cigarette. We will never be ready to shoot in ten days. Jaconelli... - What? Not ready? - Ascolta me. Be careful what you say. He's a spy from the bank. He's not exactly from the bank. You have actors waiting for you in your office. You have auditions all morning. You should see what I found. I found two sisters... I need a cigarette. He needs a shirt and a tie, Lilli. Answer the question and I will give you a coffee Answer another, and I will give you a cigarette. - Actually need an Aspirin. - Calm down. Directing a movie is a very overrated job, we all know it. You just have to say yes or no. What else? Nothing. "Should this be Red?" Yes. "Green?" No "More extras?" Yes "More lipstick?" No Yes. No. Yes. No. That's right: That's directing. It doesn't seem to make any difference what the answer is. So, please, Guido, yes or no. Do you want costumes in this film? - Yes. - You see? Simple. Might I know what period the movie is in? Soon. You know I dont allow producers in here. Two minutes Guido. Hes gone. Have you written a word of the script? No. Are you in a panic? Yes. Is Luisa going with you to the Press Conference? No. Nobody. Dante and his spy. You need to shave. You look terrible. Why is there no fire escape in here? What if somebody needed to escape? I can't face these reporters. I have nothing to say. You'll be fine. Youre a world class liar, darling. Go out there and lie for Italy. Lie for Italia. What the hell is wrong with me? I can't sleep, I can't think, I can't write. I can't breathe. My heart is racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you flowers, I know. I will come to the cemetery at the weekend. You should have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma. Could have visited you every week. Don't look at me like that. Oh, Guido, Guido. This is your Rome, Guido. The world sees Rome the way you invented it. Your films did that. - I miss you. - I miss you too. We are just waiting for the arrival of Contini any moment now Could this film put the Maestro back on top? And here he is! Thank you for coming. Silenzio, per favore. Thank you, thank you. Guido Contini's long time producer, is about to speak I just want to say a few words from my heart. I am humbled and thrilled to announce that I'm producing Guido Contini's next film: "Italia" which will star once again Contini's longtime inspiration the international film star, Claudia Jenssen. We start shooting in ten days time in Cinecitta That makes it one week from Monday. Thank you, Maestro, thank you very much. This is our ninth film together. Guido Contini. Thanks for coming, everybody. - Maestro Contini. - Yes? Grazie. Your new film is called Italia. Big title. Actually it's my shortest title yet. - But hardly a modest one. - Films are not modest. They cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people. They should have grand titles. And might you tell the press what the film is about? Why? I still don't know what my last film was about. That was the problem. Nobody else did. Of course I can tell you what my film is about I can tell you the story, I can tell you.... who I am going to cast, the music I want to use, I can tell you everything. But I won't. I'm afraid that what I say might leak to the press. Our next film will be exactly as it sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit of Italy. Italy as a myth, as a woman, Italy as a dream. - Is this true? - Sounds fantastic. Can't wait to see it. Do you consider pornography art? - Signor Contini. - Stephanie. Could you tell the fashionable women of America who your favorite designer is? I'm less interested in wrapping than what might be inside. Signor Contini, you are a man of the world, yes? Educated in Britain, a home in Biarritz. With Italia is it fair to say that youve come home for good? It's been a long time since you made a movie with your wife Do you plan on casting her in this new film? I told Luisa that when we got married I would never again make love to my leading lady. But she hasn't worked at all since working with you. But why are you being so tight-lipped about this film? Its a serious question. Whats the big deal? I would like to be here. You want me to be serious in a press conference? I would like to be there. I thought I was the clown in this circus. I would like to be everywhere at once I know thats a contradiction in terms Artists do their best work before they're famous. Now you're famous. Without wishing to be negative, your last two films, they were... Flops? Your word, flops. And it's a problem especially when My body's nearing fifty, as my mind is nearing... ten. I'm just asking if you're nervous. You seem nervous. - Excuse me? - What I'm asking, Maestro, is have you run out of things to say? I can hardly stay up, and I can't get to sleep. And I dont want to wake tomorrow morning at the bottom of some heap. But why take it so seriously? After all, there's nothing at stake here, only me. I want to be young. I want to be old. I would like to be wise before my time and yet be foolish and brash and bold. I would like the universe to get down on its knees and say: "Guido, whatever you please. It's okay even if it's impossible, we'll arrange it." That's all that I want. That's all that I want. I was wondering if you think there's a limit to what you can show in a movie. What would you like to see, that I haven't already shown you? I am lusting for more Should I settle for less? I ask you: What's a good thing for if not for taking it to excess? One limitation I dearly regret. There's one of me I've ever met. If you have any questions about... I would like to have another me to travel along with myself I would even like to be able to sing a duet with myself I would like to be here sing along with myself in a song To be there walking down a lane now Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere That's a contradiction in terms. I want to be here, with a counter here melody in the here, top of the morning to you Guido. Guido! Guido! Guido. Me, me, me. I want to be Proust or the marquis de Sade. I would like to be Christ, Mohammed, Buddha But not have to believe in God, and you know I mean it with all of my heart. It's the end if something important doesn't start I want to be young, but I have to be old What I want is a tale of sound and fury, that some idiot went and told. I would like the universe to get down on its knees and say: "Guido, whatever you please. It's okay even if its ridiculous, we'll arrange it." So arrange it. Arrange it. That's all that I want. Guido, Guido, Guido! Guido, Guido, Guido! Contini, Contini, Contini Guido! Bellavista Spa Hotel Anzio, Italy - I need a room. - Of course. - A suite. - Yes. With a view of the sea, balcony. Something with air. All of our suites have air. - Let me just look for you. - I come from Milano. - I understand. - On business. I'm a business man. Busy busy busy. Would Maestro Contini prefer to register under a pseudonym? Please. - Signor Milano? - Why not. Needless to say, I love your films. Guilty pleasure. Those early films. Not the flops. I need to see a doctor. Do you know one who's discreet? I'd like to see him today in my room, now, if possible. Consider it done. Please. And I need to place a call. To my wife. Here. You can take the call at the lobby phone over there. - Luisa? tesoro... - There you are. Is everybody mad at me? Well I'm mad at you. Where are you? I had to escape from the press conference. Oh, I heard. Dramatic. Don't tease me. I'm sick, Luisa. You're making a film. You make a film, you get sick. It's what happens. No but this time I'm really sick. Are you by yourself? Yes, of course I'm by myself. Then shall I come? - Yes, thats why I'm calling. Please come, straight away. That would be wonderful. Okay. Great. Marvelous. I don't know where you are. I don't know. Some spa. I just kept driving. I can't come if I dont know where you are. Actually, its hardly worth it. I'll be back in a day or two. Yeah... Yes, it's hardly worth it. I do wish you were here. Get some rest. Take the waters. Sleep. Then come back here and make a good movie. I love you. Get better. Your doctor is on his way. This number. If a woman answers, put it through to my room. - Otherwise... - Wrong number. What? - Dottore. - Si? What is she whispering? Is it about my blood pressure? - Is it serious? Am I dying? - Stress, exhaustion, your liver, your heart, your kidneys, They are all very cross with you, Signore. - Open wide. - Ahhhh. But you've come to the right place. There are a dozen mineral springs around the town. The Roman emperors came here for the waters. Pronto. I was lazing about my bedroom when you called and an idea occurred to me I thought you might be... wondering about. Guido. It's a very important call, doctor. I have to take it. - Private call. - As you wish. Who's not wearing any clothes? Im not, my darling. Whose afraid to kiss your toes? I'm not. Your mama dear is blowing into your ear so you'll get it loud and clear I need you to squeeze me here and here and here Dottore, his pulse, it's racing. - Is something wrong? - What? Yes, yes, it's about my film. It's from the Vatican. Go ahead, Monsignore. Of course I'm listening. cootchie cootchie cootchie coo I've got a plan for what I'm gonna do to you So hot you're gonna steam and scream, and vibrate like a string I'm plucking. Kiss your fevered little brow pinch your cheeks 'til you say "Ow" And I can hardly wait to show you how, Guido! Who won't care if you come to me tired and overworked? I wont! Bambino. Who knows the therapy to beat what you can get from me? I don't! But this will have to be enough for now Guido! Ciao. I love you, Guido. Guido! Ciao! - Carla - I'm so happy to see you! I missed you so much. - Are you happy I'm here? - Of course. But very happy or just a little happy? Very happy! What's wrong? You look very tired! Carla, all those bags for one weekend? Yes. Belavista is a very fashionable place. You know I stayed there with my parents. During the war. Carla, there's something I have to tell you. Look. They found out who I am at the hotel. - No. - Yes, it's horrible. Obviously we don't want to be followed by the press, I found the most charming pensione for you, right here, it's charming. Here at the station? Close the curtains, it's too light in here. - Perfect. Go to the corridor. - What? Yes. Count to ten, turn back in, pretend you're in the wrong room and I'm a complete stranger. I love your games. - I'm here on business. - Okay. - Wait, wait, your face. - What about it? Get your makeup. I had a nightmare last night. We went into that little ally behind Piazza Navona Where I bought you that scarf, remember? - The same your wife bought - Don't move, Carla. When you wear it I never know if it's hers or mine. So we were there on the ground, naked, kissing. We didn't care. And then my husband arrived and killed us both. With a shovel. Poor Luigi. He would never do that. He's so sweet. He speaks Latin. He knows all the roman emperors. Good for him. Perhaps there is a job for him in the movie. Why not? You could work well together. Beautiful. When you come in I want you to be my little savage. - Yes. - Go, go. You think I'm one of your actresses? Oh! Madonna! I'll pretend to be asleep. What if I really found the wrong room? Would you be jealous? Would you do such a thing? Who knows? What happened? It was the woman from the hotel. She wanted to give me towels. - Come here. - Okay. - What? - You are a stranger. - I don't know you. - Just come here. Be savage. Show me. Excuse me. I've got the wrong room. Yes you have. And I don't have the faintest idea who you are. Page one. Page one, page one, page one. The figure emerges from the darkness, like a goddess. She's Claudia, his muse. She takes the mans face and kisses him. And with that gesture he's suddenly inspired to write something... profound. Mother of God, give me a sign. - Excuse me, father. - Buongiorno. - His Excellency, the Cardinal... - Signor Contini! I'm a big fan! I would very much like to speak to the cardinal Is Claudia Jensen with you? - No. - Pity. His Excellency is a big admirer of Signorina Jenssen. Im in need of some guidance, some pointers... Do you think you can find a signed photograph of Signorina Jenssen? - For His Excellency? - Si. - I'm sure it would be possible. - Truly? What a pleasure. Arrivederci, Maestro. Guido! Guidino! I'm not going to ask how you find me. Please, it's my job. A producer needs to know where his director is at all times. Even to know the pensione where his mistress is staying. - Oh my God. - I understand, Guido. Rome is absolutely unbearable. The pressure. - It's not good. - Really, you understand? Of course I understand. Absolutely. You're not going to drag me back? You're a genius and genius must be served. Thank you my old friend. Where are we going? You can't be in Rome? Okay. Rome will come to you. It's a fantastic place for you to focus. Everyone is here to help the movie. Everyone is here because they love you, Guido. Look, with the flower and the grass and with the arches of the empire. Roman empire. You remember Donatella? - Ciao. - Ciao. - Donatella, you tested her. - I was very nervous He probably doesn't remember. I was quite nervous. No, I remember you. We all enjoyed you, so to speak. Maestro! Claudia's agent. Did she like the script? No, no no no. Impossibile. Are you telling me she didn't get the script? Pierpaulo! Claudia didn't get the script! Send her another one, for Christ sake. Send her two! - Yes, I'm sorry. - Cretino! Right now. Yes, that's what I say. People just don't realize she's an actress as well as a star. I know Dante's dying to talk to you. A dolpo. Ciao! Lombardo. What are we doing here? I'm happy. I brought my swimsuit. It was Luisa's birthday yesterday. What? No! Oh please God, no. I spoke with her yesterday, she didn't even mention it. - Give me a cigarette. - What's that? - What's that? - It's for Claudia. For which scene? I don't know which scene, until I've seen the script. But she always likes something like this, - Or you do. - Looks like Folies Bergere, It's wrong. Italian women don't wear those things. Don't knock the Folies Bergere. It brings back happy memories, that's where I... learned my art. All those sequins, all those feathers. And you're wrong. You put Claudia in one of these for that nightclub scene in "Natura Morta". Why do people love that film? Oh, Guido. Don't, that's death. Every time we have to start again. I'm trying to find it. You wont find it with your head jammed halfway up your arse. Ashtray. You were saying my head is jammed up my arse. Halfway. I don't know. Why not dream up something entertaining? Something with music. With dancing. God knows we could use a little "joie de vivre". Le Cinema today is in a crisis. The directors are so existentialistes. The movies are not worth their entrance prices If no one sings a love song when he's kissed. Love cannot be love without "Le Singing", A string, a clarinet a saxophone. Take a lesson from this old Parisienne and the finest entertainment she has known. Folies Bergere What a showing of color, costume and dancing. Not a moment in life could be more entrancing. Than an evening you spend aux Folies Bergere. Folies Bergere. Not a soul in the world could be in despair when he is glancing at the fabulous stage des Folies Bergere FOLIES BERGERE LA MUSIQUE, LA DANSE, LE SON, LA LUMIERE! LES PETITS JOLIES SEINS DES BELLES BOUQUETIERES SUR LA BELLE PASSARELLE DES FOLIES BEREGERE, PAS DE MYSTERE LE SPECTACLE EST TOUT A FAIT DECOUVERT. "ET PAS TROP CHER" VIENS CE SOIR AVEC MOI AUX FOLIES BERGERE. Bon soir, bon soir, bon soir. Je suis la vedette des Folies Bergere. Vedette, it means "star". Let me tell you: Last night I looked down at this table in the chairs you are sitting in now and what do I see? A priest! And next to him? Mon Dieu. Guido? Guido Contini? What are you doing here at the Folies Bergere? You naughty boy! You're only nine years old! But I'm glad you've come. Would you like to join me on stage? Yes, come! Come, come, come! Feeling better? There's no room for hopelessness here, is there, Guido? We must explain something to our young Guido. What do we want? Laughter! What do we want? Love! What do we want? Dreams! Let us not forget, Guido, mon cher, that is our privilege: To entertain! Folies Bergere The music, the lights and the laughter. The answer to what you are after. Each night at the Folies Bergere. Folies Bergere By the heavens above you will swear there's nothing rarer. Than the Folies Bergere. Folies Bergere The stage overflowing and giving a musical reason for living each night at the Folies Bergere. Folies Bergere To your modern ideas I compare one derriere at the Folies Bergere The answer to what you are after The music, the lights and the laughter of the Follies Berger! The Cardinal is right this way. Your Eminence, Signor Contini is here. I like Charlie Chaplin. Me too. A genius. What can I do for you? - Do you believe in God? - Signor Contini, please. No, no, it's an honest question. - Yes, I believe in God. - So do I. Are you a catholic? Yes, very much so. Not as much as I would like to be. Not as much as you would like me to be, Im sure, but certainly yes, I'm trying. - Try harder. - Yes, I will. Your Eminence... I'm not happy, I'm searching for something. I feel a sense of misery, of despair... I saw your films. Not the flops, the others, the good ones. But you think people need to see so much sex? It's not necessary. We can all imagine. Excuse me. My films are what I imagine. Then your imagination has no moral training. How do you train the imagination? Imagination is God's garden. Dont let the Devil play in it. Teach our Italian women to be wives, not whores. Don't make us look at filth and debauchery. Make us proud to be Italian. Pesaro Italy 1926 Guido! The money, the money. - Let's go. - Guido, go! Saraghina. Saraghina! So you little Italian devils... You want to know about love? Saraghina will tell you. If you want to make a woman happy You rely on what you were born with. Because it is in your blood. Be Italian. Be Italian. Take a chance and try to steal a fiery kiss. Be Italian. Be Italian. When you hold me, don't just hold me but hold this! Please be gentle, sentimental, go ahead and try to give my cheek a pat. But be daring and uncaring. When you pinch me try to pinch me where there's fat! Be a singer, be a lover. Pick the flower now before the chance is past. Be Italian Be Italian. Live today as if it may become your last! Be a singer, Be a lover. Pick the flower now before the chance is past. Be Italian. Be Italian. Live today as if it may become your last. Guido! I'm ashamed of you, Guido. Mamma, what did I do? Bring him here. That savage is the devil. God will punish you for your sins now and forever. What? - What? - I can't breathe. Guido, don't die on me. Can you imagine. Poor Luigi! It would kill him. If I die it would kill your husband? No, that's not what I meant, Guidino. No. - Where are you going? - I have to go to work. Carla, I can't breathe! - Let me come with you. - It's impossible. - Why? - Because it's impossible! - Please! - Why is it impossible? Look at your producer. He's married, he brings his girlfriend to work and nobody cares. Guido, everybody knows about me. Why, why won't you let me near you? For the very same reason you dont want me to die on top of you. It's not fair to your husband. - It's not fair to my wife! - You're playing with me. You're twisting everything. Please let me come with you. I'll be here, waiting for you, with my legs open. DIMMI QUANDO TU VERRAI DIMMI QUANDO QUANDO QUANDO Let's say there were ten sequences, each one set in a different period, but played by the same cast. Something light and hectic, like Mozart would do it, like Figaro. - Like the circus. - Claudia will be amazing. - Sounds like a masterpiece. - He hasn't written a word. A screenplay is first of all a map. That's a map. Let's try to dig for something else. Maybe a group of people digging, in the desert. Luisa? Is that his wife? I can't believe you came. The jungle drums said it was an emergency. The jungle drums exaggerated just a tiny bit. Not entirely. You haven't been sleeping. I was dying, until just now. Come. Don't think I forgot your birthday. When you get home, the house will be full of flowers. - Am I already going home? - I hope not. Happy Birthday, my darling. - Here she is. At last. - Buona Sera. Magnificent. - You know Donatella? - I do now. - Thank you for calling. - You're saving the movie. Give him a good idea for God's sake. Let's drink a toast to Luisa's birthday. - Happy Birthday! - It was Monday. - Happy Birthday! - Thank you. Happy Birthday. - Maestro. - Ah, Don Mario. Excuse me, darling, this is Don Mario. This is my wife, Luisa. - A pleasure, Signora. - Sit down, won't you? - Please. Please. - Thanks. Buona Sera. I was telling your husband how much I admire his movies. Publicly, the church condemns them. We have to. But we all love them. Last year we did our own version of your "Il Vicolo" at the Christmas Party. - That I'd pay to see. - Luisa was in that film. She was the best thing in the movie. It's true. It was your first part. Of course. You are Luisa Acari. Oh my Lord! I was. You can't stop being somebody. Can't you? Well there's a good catholic wife for you, Guido. That's what they do: Sacrifice. Still, Signora Contini... it must be a very exciting life for you. My husband makes movies To make them he lives a kind of dream. In which his actions aren't always what they seem. He may be on to some unique romantic theme. Some men run banks. Some rule the world. Some earn their living baking bread. My husband he goes a little crazy making movies instead. My husband spins fantasies. He lives them then gives them to you all. Like Michelangelo he paints his private dome. But can't distinguish what's his work and what's his home. Some men sell stocks. Some men punch clocks. Some leap where others fear to tread. My husband as author and director makes up stories in his head. Guido Contini, Luisa Contini, Number one genius and number one fan. Guido Contini, Luisa Contini, Passionate woman in love with this man. Long ago. Many years ago. Once we two were Guido Contini, Luisa his lover, actress with dreams and a life of her own. Then we had no end of world to discover, Singing together all night on the phone. Long ago. Someone else ago. Signorina Acari, per favore. Provino numero uno. Luisa Acari. Your name is Italian. My father is Italian. My mother is French. What have you done before? I've waited. Waited for this? Waited tables. And, of course, I studied theater and mime in Paris. But mostly waited tables. - Thank you. - For what? Thank you for what I'm looking at. Keep running. Long ago Someone else ago How he needs me so And he'll be the last to know it My husband makes movies to make them he makes himself obsessed He works for weeks on end without a bit of rest No other way can he achieve his level best. Some men read books, some shine their shoes. Some retire early, some stay up to dream and muse My husband only rarely comes to bed My husband makes movies instead My husband makes movies Excuse me, I suddenly feel very tired. What happened? Luisa? I'm staggered by my own stupidity. I could vomit! Luisa, please tell me, what happened? You open your mouth and a lie comes out. What lie? Why am I surprised? It's like breathing to you. Guido. I was hungry. I'm tired of eating alone! There are plenty of restaurants. I wanted to see the hotel. I told you I came here with my parents when I was little. I didn't come to disturb you. You certainly managed to. Why didn't you tell me Luisa was going to be here? I didn't know she was here. She just turned up. Well she could have warned you. The only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me. A taxi please, for the Signora. Right away. Carla, you have to wait outside. Will you wait with me? I'm in the middle of a working dinner with my colleagues. So why do I have to wait outside? I'll find someone to escort you home. Signora... would you rather wait inside? I'm going to walk. Please tell my friend I had to leave. Apparently she's staying in some grotesque pensione next to the station. Luisa? If I'd invited her here, she'd be staying in the hotel, wouldn't she? Think about it. I didn't even know you were coming. - Very plausible. - Because it's true. You told me it was finished. It is, she was worried about me, she came to see if I was alright, which is stupid but not a crime and hardly a mortal sin. What? What are you laughing about? Nothing. If you could see yourself. I couldn't live with it. The absurdity of being you. The effort of having to hide and lie and cheat It's exhausting. No wonder you've got no script. You're too busy inventing your own life. It's finished. It's finished. It wasn't before but it is now. Bla bla bla bla bla! - Vodka. - I'll have one of those. Due. Hi, Guido Contini. Stephanie, from Vogue. - Remember me? - Yes, I remember very well. Stephanina from Vogue. So, coincidence. You being here and me being here. Amazing. May I take a cigarette? Quite the performance at the press conference, the vanishing act. Oh, no, please. My treat. Please. - Grazie. - Prego. - I've seen all your movies. - Yeah? Like a million times. They're the only movies that tell the truth about the modern world. What truth is that? Death of religion. Sexual revolution. I don't think religion is dead. And what exactly is the sexual revolution? That we can talk about later. You have such style. I always think that. That's the other thing I love about your movies. Style. Every frame is like a postcard. - Okay. - It's great. You care as much about the suit as the man wearing it. It's the Italian man in you: pays for the drinks, undresses you with his eyes. - I hate that man. - No! Style is the new content. It's what my readers love. They want to dress like Claudia Jenssen. Undress like Claudia Jenssen. They want to ride on a Vespa down the Via Veneto They want to live in an Italian movie. I love the black and white I love the play of light The way Contini puts his image through a prism. I feel my body chill gives me a special thrill each time I see that Guido Neo-Realism. I love the dark and handsome guys with their skinny little ties dressing mod' looking out of sight Love to watch 'em as they cruise with their pointy leather shoes wearin' shades in the middle of the night. Whatever Guido does he makes me smile He is the essence of Italian style I love the glamorously Latin world that only Guido can portray! Contini's cinema Italiano! I love his cinema Italiano! He makes me feel with cinema Italiano My life is real with cinema Italiano He is the king of cinema Italiano Those scenes I love to see from Guidos "POV" There's no one else with his unique director's vision. His angles wide and tight each moment feels so right defines Italian style by only his decision! I love the speedy little cars the hip coffee bars the sleek women in positano Guido's the ultimate "Uomo Romano"! Cause it is cinema Italiano I love his cinema Italiano Guido! Guido! Guido! Dark and handsome guys skinny little ties shades in the middle of the night. Speedy little cars, hip coffee bars sleek women in positano! ECCO IL RE DEL CINEMA ITALIANO QUESTO O E IL CINEMA ITALIANO NELLA MIA ANIMA NELLA MIA ANIMA NELLA MIA ANIMA CINEMA ITALIANO BIANCO-NERO BIANCO-NERO BIANCO-NERO NERO NERO CINEEEMAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ITALIAAAAAAAAAAAANOOO NELLA MIA ANIMA CINEMA ITALIANO NELLA MIA ANIMA CINEMA ITALIANO CONTINIS CINEMA ITALIANO! I love you, Luisa. Can we please try to be close again? Pronto. Is the doctor still with her? Yeah, he's in there. He's waiting for you. This way. - You came. - I'm here. Signor Contini. Come back. She took five or six pills. Enough to make herself very sick. I understand she's your mistress. This is a sordid business. You movie people... I supposed you don't consider yourself bound by morality. Guido? Dove corri? Where are you running to? Thank you. I'm going to stay with her now. If you need us for anything just call, okay? Fransesca, andiamo. Grazie. - I should call your husband. - No, he'll take me home. What have you done to yourself? - I'm not worth dying for, Carla. - Don't be angry with me. Everything I do, I just want you to love me. When you're not here with me, I'm still here. When you're in your life, making your movies, dancing with your wife, I'm still here. You should rest. We'll talk about everything in the morning. Don't leave me. Rest. Rest, cara mia... Caro, caro mio. GUARDA LA LUNA CHE BRILLA LASSU How the moon glows as it smiles over you. When you're dreaming blissfully Dreaming, flying free. My husband thinks I'm clever. It's a strange thing because I'm not. Well, you know that. I spend too much time in my little brain thinking about you. Where you are, what you're doing, what you dream of. Oh dream of your youth when I'm still by your side Dream of your manhood pray I'm there to guide you And when you grow old how my love still will shine Always remember my son you will always be mine Yes, mine. GUIDO SAI CHE TI VOGLIO BENE, FIGLIOLO MIO, Guido, do you think that so many will love you as I do. Guarda la luna, she hangs in the sky Beaming her blessing to make you and I know that this one good night kiss will keep all your life perfect like this. Hold on to me, Mama. Don't let me wake from this. Excuse me. - Is she okay? - Yes - I'd like to take her home. - Of course. I'm sorry. She loves you. You know that, don't you? She's my wife. Darling? - We're going back to Rome. - Where's Luisa? She's gone. She's had it with you. Quite frankly, so have I. You dragged the whole crew up here and disappeared. I can't protect you anymore. Claudia is in Rome. Makeup tests starts today. Remember? - I can't - You must. Don't sit down. - I need help. - You've had help. You've seen the doctors, you've seen the priests, - You've taken the cure. - I'm not cured. That's enough. The movie calls. Your star has landed. Fausto, take his things, please. Guido, andiamo! - I need more time. - Forget the script. Claudia's here now. She will inspire you to do what you do best. Write with your camera. Maestro. The screen tests are back from the lab. - Will you watch them now? - Tonight. We'll watch everything tonight and make some decisions. Design meeting? Production meeting? Tonight. Claudia says: where are you? She's in fine form. Feisty. She asked if she could read my script as she didn't have one. I said I didn't quite have mine. - Pronto. - Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up. I want you to be with me in the screening room tonight. I want to talk to you about the casting, the script. Everything. Otherwise, I won't be able to start... I won't know what I'm thinking. Maestro. Are you there, Luisa? Go on. I'm not asking you to let me come home. I just want you to come to the screen test tonight. Not for me, but for the movie. You always have. You always do. Silence please. - Se gira. - And we are rolling. Could you turn to the right please, Claudia? Yes. I can turn to my right. And, can you turn to the left? I can turn to my left. Now just one slow turn for us. Okay, one slow turn. Belissima. Brava. Cut. We've got it. Next costume, please. Has anybody got a script? Script missing. Handsome reward... Lost: one script title "Italia". Can't make a film without it. So interesting to do hair and makeup for a part when you don't know what the part is. I'm going back to my hotel now. Please, just a couple of more costumes... I'm going back to my hotel, my darling. And when there is a script I will read it, and then we can take it from there. I love the costumes, Lilli. They are beautiful. - Ciao, Bello. - That's fair. - Claudia! - That's fair. - Fair? - I'll be back. - You've got dailies, Guido. - I'll be right back. You've got meetings! You look ravishing. You're not seeing me, you're seeing Lilli's wigs and makeup, I'm somewhere hidden underneath. It's good to see you. Im assuming that's code for: "there's no script" Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed with a script? Talk to the people who love you in our films. They're not interested in my script! They're interested in the way you turn your head, the way the camera looks past you to the moon, the way you smile a little as you cry, the way you really do blush for the camera. How?! Who even knows, but... whatever else it is it's not my script. So Lilli says I'm playing a million different parts. Not a million. You're the muses, the incredible women who made Italy what it is today. A country run by men, themselves run by women, whether they know it or not. So I am women behind the great men. The great women, in a way, yes. You have this man in the story, and he's... wants to take hold of everything, devour everything. He can't let anything go, or he doesn't want to. And he changes direction every day because he's lost, he's dying, bleeding to death. And these muses they fall in love with the man? Exactly. - They fall in love with him. - I'd rather be the man. - What? - I'd rather be the man. In a very unusual way, one time I needed you. In a very unusual way, you were my friend. Maybe it lasted a day Maybe it lasted an hour. But somehow it will never end. These women, who come off their pedestals for a kiss. - They're just fantasies. - No, you misunder... In a very unusual way I think I'm in love with you. In a very unusual way, I want to cry. Something inside me goes weak, Something inside me surrenders, and you're the reason why. You're the reason why. You dont know what you do to me, you don't have a clue. You can't tell what it's like to be me looking at you. It scares me so that I can hardly speak. She's his inspiration. I can't keep playing that part. I fall in love with you every time. When there's a camera between us. No. It's not a real person, Guido. And this man you describe, He doesn't know how to love. In a very unusual way, I owe what I am to you There was a time once we were on location, some terrible hotel. You were in the room directly above me. I could hear you walking about. And all through the night I wanted to rush up the stairs and hammer on your door until you opened. And why didn't you? I don't know. Special to me in my life, since the first day that I met you. How could I ever forget you, once you had touched my soul. In a very unusual way you've made me whole Maybe you should have knocked. Maybe you should've knocked me right off the pedestal. I can't do this anymore. This is me. And you have a wife who loves you. I'll miss you. Wrong girl. Great work Lilli. Wonderful costume. Thank you. And the hair, makeup. Fantastic. - She has a beautiful profile. - Two great profiles. - She's a goddess. - And the back isn't too bad. She came directly from Venus. Beautiful. Yeah. Fantastic. Guido? Really nice. Who's next? - Actresses. - Lets see the actresses. If we like her, we have to call her agent right away. - Everybody wants her right now. - Well they can keep her. - Now go and sit down. - She's a very funny actress. Shes peculiar. You dont like her Guido? My name is Ilaria. - I like her. - Who asked you? Mind your business. - Thanks. - Thank you. Grazie. - Donatella Valentini. - Valentini. Go and look at yourself in the mirror. Whatever you feel like doing is fine. Just walk, normally, you don't have to bounce around. Forget that I'm here, there's no one else in the room. She's nice. To the person you would most like to call. Darling. First you have to dial the numbers. - She's natural. - Even better. She's a bit nervous here. What do you say, Guido? Donatella is nice, huh? - Who's this? - Giovanni. - Would you start by... - He said he wanted a blond. - Hi. Im Alessia - Giovanni. - From the North. - Where exactly? - Padula. - Padula. - She's too tall. - Yeah, very tall. Bye She's very beautiful. Very nice. - It's not the point. - Guido wants the blonde. It's just what I like. Permettere Thank you. Thank you for looking like this. Perfect. - She's beautiful. - She's too beautiful. I think we are happy with Donatella. - Donatella is better, isnt she? - Sure. Well, great. Anyway, fantastic day. But we have to go home. We have a very very busy day tomorrow. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Okay, well done. It meant so much to us all that you came. What did you think? Did you like anybody? Luisa? You want my love? Take it all. You want to watch it all come off? Take it all. Come on now, show me how, you take it all. - Thank you. - What for? Thank you for reminding me I'm not special. You don't even see what you do, do you? Even the moments I think are ours, it's just you... working to get what you want. You want my glove? Are you enthralled? You want to see it slip away and watch it fall? Oh, we know its your show, so take it all. What are you talking about? The screen test? You have to understand, this is nothing. This is what I do, I direct. It's my job. And this is our life. You think to create is to forgive yourself in public. Fine. But dont think I can forgive you in private, because I can't. Ever. So go ahead. Take it all. You want my soul? Take it all! It's time to leave, if I'm to live. Because I have no more, there's nothing left to give. I watch you rise. I watch you fall. While I am standing with my back against the wall. Now it's your turn to finally learn. You had the world, you had your fling, you wanted more than everything. You got your wish, you got your prize, now take it right between your thighs. You grabbed for everything my friend but dont you see that in the end there will be nothing! You're just an appetite. And if you'd stop being greedy you'd die. You take everything. And I'm empty. You know, I'm glad I came. I can see now it's hopeless. What have I done? What have I done, Luisa? I can't make this movie. There's no way that I'll begin it. I can't bear to see the cameras roll. Problem is the subject, there's no pleasant way to treat it. The problem is the authors lost control. How I wish it didn't have to be so, but we cut the losses starting now. Strike the set and keep it for some sideshow. Tell the cast and crew that they can all go. Find another genius, I can't be one or become one, I can't even tell how I'd begin. Help, Luisa, help me. Help me Mamma, help me someone. Here's a place where I have never been. Guido out in space with no direction, Guido at a loss for more to say. Guido with no intervening actors, Guido at the mercy of detractors, Guido here with no one else but... Nothing holds together, nothing makes a better sense now impossible to grasp or understand. How can I go on to watch the whole of my existence end up being nothing that I planned? Have I lost myself and all I wished for? Has my life become a mindless game? Guido, I can't stand the name of Guido. Guido, for God's sake, who is this Guido? Guido here with no one else but Guido... I destroyed everything, Mamma. I destroyed everything. I just... You make one wrong turn and then because of that after it all the turns are wrong. And you are so far from where you wanted to be and you're lost. And then you're lost. No one can help you find your way. It's up to you, Guido. Up to you. Nobody else. Old friends, I have to come clean with you. There is no movie. I can't pretend anymore. We have to stop. I'm sorry. Anguillara, Italy I'm glad she's acting again. I made her costumes for the play. - She's funny. - She seems so happy. I didn't want to interfere. Is she with anybody, Lilli? Guido. She's my friend. I'm not her mother. I dont know, I expect so. Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me you're gonna let me cut your hair and get rid of that awful beard. I like to get about without everyone pointing at me. And where are you getting about? Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be able to walk. Are you seeing anybody? - No! No. Sounds exciting. Walking around and not seeing anyone, growing a beard. I might come up here and join you. Don't tease me, Lilli. My heart is... I just miss her. I should have "idiot" tattooed on my forehead. Luisa certainly thinks so. Does she? Did she really say that? Stop. I'm not going to act as a postman between you both. Come back to Rome. Make a movie. Go to work. No. Never. I spent this time trying to learn something. to not be the person that forgets about everybody else. The person who never grew up. You're such a dope, arent you? Making movies wasn't your problem. You were the problem. Don't stop being a child. You'll never make another movie. No one wants that, specially Luisa. Guido... there probably isn't a single person passing by who hasn't been touched in some way by one of your movies. That's your gift, that's what you've been given. Use it. Just use it with some grace for Christ sake. The only movie I could make now... I don't know. Would be about a man trying to win back his wife. Sounds perfect. The costumes might not be so bad too. We're ready to begin! I can't remember how you do this. You'll remember. Maestro. Bonjourno. I don't want to say too much. The first way we kill our film is by talking about it. But this scene is about reconciliation. And within the scene I would like you to try to find your way to begin that journey back towards each other. Presto! Presto! Take your places! Andiamo! Andiamo! We start from the beginning each time, and I feel today as if I'm starting from the beginning. Well just keep asking each other questions and dont look to me for the answers. - Okay? - We will try our best. Maestro, should I call final checks? Yes. Yes, please. I'd like to try... Makeup, please! Final checks! Could you... Silencio per favore! Silence please! Gyriamo. E alora motore! "WORKING TITLE NINE" Slate. Action. I love the black and white I love the play of light The way Contini puts his image through a prism. I feel my body chill gives me a special thrill each time I see that Guido Neo-Realism. I love the dark and handsome guys with their skinny little ties dressing mod' looking out of sight Love to watch 'em as they cruise with their pointy leather shoes wearin' shades in the middle of the night. Whatever Guido does he makes me smile He is the essence of Italian style I love the glamorously Latin world that only Guido can portray! Contini's cinema Italiano! I love his cinema Italiano! He makes me feel with cinema Italiano My life is real with cinema Italiano He is the king of cinema Italiano Those scenes I love to see from Guidos "POV" There's no one else with his unique director's vision.
