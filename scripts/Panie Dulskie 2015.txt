A large, old apartment on the second floor. Paintings on the walls, an older gentleman who never speaks shuffling cards. Where do I remember this from? I don't know. You remembered about your mother. Where do you know him from? Leave him alone Mom, let him sleep. He's Swiss. Well-mannered. A professor. Flowers like in a Boznanska painting. So many nights under-slept Murky and unkempt. Tight from the smoke.. You're too easy on them, too easy. They've all gone to seed on you. You lack character. Sure, it's true, I'll never be like you. You always destroyed everyone, killed everyone, even my beloved brother Zbyszko, you were able to destroy him too. Zbyszko and his rebellions, his demonstrations - all senseless. - He also lacked character. - Of course, only you had character. Hanka? Bled out and died and Zbyszko - disappeared never to be heard from again. So I should have let him have a baby with the maid? To get married to the maid? All I see is a sea of blood. - A sea of blood. - Stop torturing me. It's cold in here. Couldn't Gabby light the stoves? - She's not dressed yet. - Not dressed? The maid's not dressed?! Unthinkable before the war. They brought the coal. I told you so many time not to read in the bathroom. You could supervise the coal delivery instead. They always cheat on the weight, always. That's because all the scales are off. In all of Poland. If you're so smart, then you fix them. The Party will fix them. They probably thought I couldn't hear them Mom and Grandma. I was fixing my bow in the mirror and they were arguing, not paying attention to me. And in their memory Hanka and the whole room smeared with blood. Whose blood? What do you mean whose blood? That poor Hanka's. - What Hanka? - Hush. - You're talking crazy today. - Not now. We're listening. "The head screamed 'Look! Look me in the eyes!'" And the major wanted to sleep. So many nights under slept Murky and unkempt. Tight from the smoke... 'Take him away!' - he told the escort and slumbered. Sleep Major, dawn is near, don't you see the moon took first watch. "Sixth year of Security vigilance, guarding land wrested from the lords." Well? - What did the poet have in mind? - Not so loud, Gabby... - The dimwit won't understand anything. - Did you like it Grandma? Learning poetry shapes character and memory. Sleep well, Gabby? Why shouldn't I sleep well? - Walk the girls to school then. - What are they, blind? Good luck. Zbiggie... Hey there, sisters. I'm broke. Did Mom give you cash for donuts and orangeade? Are Mom and Dad home? Gabby's home, if that's what you want to know. Gabby is studying. - That's not what we pay her for. - Get out of here! Come on fellas, get it loaded! Your horse took a shit. It'll get picked up. Zbiggy and Gabby the maid were quite the pair. Surprisingly, Grandma allowed it. She knew all about it. She knew about their affair and didn't protest. Maybe she had a change of heart. Times changed, the government, the truth. And as you can see, my mother still lives here. - Hey there, Sis. - Hello. Zbiggie, why did you lug the bike upstairs? This is the newest Nishiki, can't leave it down there. I read you're making a movie? About the family? That's what movies are about these days Gabby. About yourself or family, honest. About servants' rooms and informant fathers. You know, all the dirty laundry. That's just perfect since Zbiggie has just decided to run for office. Great, so finally, you decided to run. You're clean. The Dulskis were never activists. Always sat out. Didn't sign the Volklist, didn't fight in the underground... Found out about the Holocaust from a movie... Exactly right. Never joined the Party or Solidarity either. Ideal candidates. Nobody would say that in my Canton. - And who is he? - A Psychiatry professor. We met at the festival in Locarno. His name is Dulsk and he has the same dreams that I have. Do you practice Joga? That's just great Gabby, really. Get off that bike Zbiggie, I mean it, or you'll give me the spins. Have a seat, everyone. Hanka, what's this? Ls that how I taught you to light the stove? Good Lord! You bumpkin! Damnation... Zbyszko... Oh Lord... Girls! Get up! Time for school. Please, get up, now, move it! Felician! On your feet! You hear me? Get a move on! You're going to be late! Hanka! Move, out of my way! I'll show you how. There. What's that look for? I would like to ask Madame that from the first, I will leave your service. Hanka! Don't you dare! Who paid for you?! I found someone to take my place. The city's messed up your head! I won't have it! You all will drive me to my grave! When they send me to Karlsbad you won't manage without me! - You'll die here like flies! - The priest said to leave. What priest? Who do you answer to? Me, or some priest? Who do you serve? The priest or me? Go get the rolls! Immediately! Good Lord. Felician, Felician, you'll be late for the office. Get going already! You hear me?! Get moving! Oh dear Lord, go. Just don't use the hot water. Use only cold water. Build character. Don't you sass me! Jesus! Hanka, did you know that Zbyszko was out all night? He wouldn't. Stop it, Hanka feels bad enough as it is. It's not like that, Miss. Breakfast time. My dear friend, what is my name? Your name, Sir, is Zbyszko Dulski. Unfortunately. My love, let's be off! Your horse took a shit. Thank you, Sir. - Good day. - Good day. - Can I be of assistance, perhaps? - No, thank you. I would, however, let myself be invited for tea. Do you need yet another scandal in the building? I know of no scandal. Then you shall find out. Have a good day. Her husband is cheating on her. With the maid. She's just now found out about it, poor thing. Oh, Jesus. We do not speak the Lord's name in this house, in vain, of course. Leave me alone, Sir, I'm working. You instantly turn ugly whenever you get snooty. And the sluts that you're coming back from - are they prettier? No. What? I told your mother that I want to quit. Oh, and Mommy ordered you to stay, didn't she? She's a Dulski after all. Always the same terrible Mommy. - The priest told me to leave. - The priest. So pray for me will you, Hanka? Pray for me. Here? In a burgher's house, the living room is the chapel, isn't it? Get to it. Madame will be right back. She won't. The caretaker might steal a shovelful of coal. Oh Jesus! Good morning. Oh, good morning! And where are you off to? My fianc is coming to pick me up on his motorcycle. Is that right? With a sidecar. That bumpkin. He may be a bumpkin, but he's got a motorcycle. So that's why you got up so early. I have a day off today. Your mother gave me time off. Because you told her you've got training. Because I do. In the bushes. By the river. Fine, do what you like. But there's a new movie tonight. You could watch it. - What movie? - "Chapaev..." Really? Let's scram! Excuse me, pardon me. Hey, don't push!... Get back. Get in line! So, this is who I look like? I already told you that you're prettier than her. Come on. What are you doing here, Dad? Well, you know, working... You should have told me. Step over here with me, can't do it in front of people. Alone or with a woman? Well, you know, alone... Here Dad, go to the movies. There... - So are you a ticket scalper Son? - I'm no scalper, I'm an employee. Of the cultural department. Dad went to the movies? What did you see? Silence... This doesn't concern you. Go to your room. Your aunt went to the cinema and died. It's true. My older sister got the Spanish flu in the cinema. - And Grandma is tired. - No I'm not. I'm not tired. I've never been tired. And Felician never left the house without my permission. And you? The whole family traipses around the city Lord knows where. And Felician went for walks right here, around this table. And I had my eye on him. You've let yourself go. Maybe I have but it's you, Mother, who has blood on her hands. What blood? Whose blood? What do you mean whose blood? You know very well whose blood. You're lucky you didn't go to prison. Show me your hands Grandma! You see? Well? Is that how we talk in front of the children? About things like that? When elders speak, children listen! Don't sass! Even Felician didn't talk back to me! Exactly! When the SS asked him for his papers, he said nothing to him either! And it ended with a bribe to the Gestapo. Dear God, I could have bought a fur coat with that money. A Persian lamb coat. He did not answer the agent downstairs either! Good evening. I'm here for the fitting. He's cheating on me, the bastard. Who? My husband. Goes to see that slut at number 20 on the second floor. Nah, that's not possible. Not possible? I know he is. You're not going to poison yourself with matches, right? It's such a petty poison. If it doesn't work, it'll be a hoot. Mrs. Dulski, who said I wanted to kill myself? I will kill him, that son of a whore. You only live once. And? How do I look? Splendid. Now you can go to the ministry ball. Right. But will I have anyone to go with? I ordered Auntie Vienna coffee. Thank you darling, thank you. - Today, Auntie picks up the bill. - Me? For silence. Do you mean Zbyszko? He might actually join the socialists. You don't say, the Dulskis are not activists, ever. I shouldn't have had children. I would travel from spa to spa. No worries about anything, not a care in the world... I shouldn't have had children. That's why my husband and I don't get involved. - But you go to the theatre instead. - Auntie also went. You left after the first act. Where did you go, not home I presume. I will pay since I invited you. Is that the sculptor over there? Yes, that's him. With her. You know, the one you rent the flat to. I'll raise her rent, by ten. - That's too little. - You think? Of course. She's got money. Easily earned... Here he is, the other admirer, see? They don't like each other him and the sculptor. He just threw his spring water in his face! What a scandal... scandal... in a public place? - Like Zbyszko and Hanka. - Where? What? That tramp... I'll throw her out immediately! Big mistake. Who is going to keep Zbyszko home? I'm leaving. I don't want them to question me as a witness. Auntie! You didn't pay for the coffee! What are you doing out with Hanka? I like her. I thought you had better taste. Funny. If I were you I would go after a more... solid relationship... There are so many married women... my God. Thanks a lot. I have enough trouble at home. Besides, I don't want a husband to come by and blow my head off. Like this guy here did to his competition. The one from the third floor? From first floor. Husband forgot himself with the maid. Elegant or not, he forgot himself and she found out... What's going on in my building? Poor woman tried to kill herself... Because of her husband. - Was she successful? - They'll save her. She tried to poison herself with matches. Didn't even know how to do that. Hysteria. Mommy is turning into Zbyszko. Horrible, truly horrible. Hanka, are the girls back from boarding school? Can't you see us Mom? Get to your lessons. Change into your house clothes. The dance lesson is cancelled, you can practice your scales. What happened Mom? Stop asking questions and remember: Modesty is a girl's greatest treasure. Hanka, follow me to the bedroom. My head is splitting. I'm sorry for everything. An ambulance... ambulance at my building. Hanka... there will be a scandal for all the papers. Accidents happen. In our village, the steam engine pulled in Mr. Golubiew... Listen, I will raise your salary, you hear? By a tenner. There. But Zbyszko is to stay home. But how can we do that Madame? Must I explain to you how to do that? We have four walls, we have the ceiling for that, understand? So that we can wash our dirty laundry in house. So nobody knows. I don't want another scandal, hear? In my building, I don't want another scandal. Hanka! Hanka? Why did that lady want to kill herself? Because of love. Nobody heard anything! Radio! Girls! Put away your books so they don't think we read. That Rodakowski has to go too. Mom, over there! Not a peep! Like Felician? Like Felician! You intend to hang this up? It was up once before, when Stalin died. - You have another opportunity today. - And what's that? You didn't hear anything? You're standing around as if you heard something. What, the neighbor's dress needs altered? Did it not fit right at the ball? At what fucking ball? Well, she was going to the ball with her husband. And how do you know that? Because when I was fitting her dress, she was so happy about the ball. And where were you yesterday evening? I was at the movies. Saw "Chapaev..." I also saw "Chapaev..." And I also saw "Chapaev..." And Grandma? Grandma has never been to the movies. So, how about it gentlemen? Three tickets for "Chapaev"? You have them? - I'm the projectionist. - Ls it worth seeing? Sir, it's the leading accomplishment of Soviet cinematography. And the political officer character; A masterpiece. So hand them over. So you say you heard nothing? Did you hear anything now? Very good. You heard nothing, you saw nothing. Shut your mouths and keep them shut. Or we'll be back. "And Grandma is to go see "Chapaev" too. The security agent who shot her security agent husband came back in '58 and lived here a few more years. People said she had blood on her hands. I remember her saying: I'm proud I have blood on my hands. One fewer agent at least. My mother also said that to Grandma. What did you do to that poor Hanka, Mom? You have blood on your hands. Hey Gabby, Mela, Hela off to school! Walk them! Stand up straight! And don't gossip! Home is like a well! Remember that for the rest of your lives! Wojtek! To the office or they'll dock your pay for tardiness! And Grandma and Zbiggie - to the movies! Keep Grandma there for a few showings so she doesn't forget anything. I will not go to the cinema. What?! Mom, you trying to start a counterrevolution here? Did you hear what the security agent said? To the cinema, now! Screw what the security agent said! I won't go to the cinema! The Dulskis never joined anything! You will go, Mom, and you will memorize every frame of the film. Wojtek, Zbiggie! Take Grandma out! Grandma, do you want us to wind up in Siberia? Mom, what is a frame? You'll find out when you grow up. And how did you like it, Mom? I am "Chapaev..." From that moment on, Grandma started to go to the movies with enthusiasm. Mostly to watch Soviet movies, since there were mostly those. Sometimes she would take me with her despite Mother's protests. I found out what a frame was very quickly. Make your film about the downfall of Communism. Switzerland is waiting for such a film from Poland. Maybe Switzerland. The downfall of Communism. I won't get an Oscar for that! What, should I ponder street vendors selling from cots? Or the destruction of the Dzierzynski monument? That's just kitsch! Now, other things are important. What's closest. I feel it. Now, you have to be as intimate as possible. About yourself, your families. About your abortions, masturbations. For example, if my father had molested me. That would be a great subject these days. Or my brother. About family secrets and dramas. What's so dramatic in my family? My sister moved to Australia and so what? She wasn't dying of cancer. But cancer? It's such a great subject. Very filmable. What about Hanka? What do you think? It feels like she's around here somewhere. Because Hanka is a great subject. A family crime. Hidden, committed... So dark, sexual... No, no, no. I don't like sex... My friend is making a movie about how she had vagina reduction surgery. - And now she likes sex? - No. You've got to wear shoes at the wedding. Right, a wedding. You kill me. You like this work, Hanka, you do. - You're such a pig. - Why am I a pig? - Because you shouldn't talk about it. - Don't talk about it... When they caught Golubiew with the alderman's wife, the whole village knew, but nobody talked about it. Didn't talk about it, didn't talk about it... Come here you, come... Sit in Mother's place... Tell me, is it nice to sit there? You know it... And what do you feel? That I could slam my fist on the table. So do it!... Come on, do it! No more traipsing around the city! Now play something for me! Something happy! Now... Nice, don't you think? Your strap came loose. Hanka, tie the strap in the slipper. Aniela, look at her. Hanka, you're pale as a ghost. - You're only imagining it Miss. - I'm not imagining anything. What? Can't wait to go out? To the caf? Here's your share. Spendthrift. Let go of me. - What's wrong with you? - I don't know, I don't feel so well. Maybe you caught something from Hanka? Caught what? Who caught something? From who? Let me see. You're staying home. Come, we're leaving. Don't look in the mirror so much or you just might see the Devil. I got him from you, Mother. I'll break this umbrella over your head if you talk to me this way. Good. Now shoes. Let's go. What? Well? I think someone is holding me prisoner. Something is choking me. I don't know what to call it. You'll grow out of it. But I like this... melancholy, Brother. The real Dulski nature will come out of you one day. Why do you make fun of everything? Because soon everything will go to Hell anyway. The world will end and... finito. But don't worry. Hanka, it's a mismatch but it will be alright. And who would marry me now? What do you mean? Zbyszko would. Zbyszko? What are you two doing here? You're the only good in this house. Good evening. Good evening. - You won't tell Mom that I was smoking? - Never. That's good... - Want one? - No. Tell me. Zbyszko is in love with Hanka. What an ass... Oh well, it happens. Mother will not permit this marriage. - Besides, nobody will want Hanka anyway. - And why is that? That's what Hanka said. She said that? I never lie. But you do spy. By accident. No spying- No peeping. Eyes closed. As if nothing was going on. Why are you so pale? I have a toothache. There's something in the air... So tell me, what are you sniffing around here for? How should I put it, Auntie? I've seen you on the streets lately. - Should I walk on the roofs? - You've dyed your hair red... Have you ever seen a decent woman with dyed hair? Red hair? That's a bit much. I don't talk about you, Auntie. - Go ahead, go right ahead and talk. - I better not. But do go on, don't hold back. I'll tell you since you insist, Auntie. - My house is respected on the streets. - Not for long. What are you alluding to? I'll explain if you invite me to the christening, Auntie. What is this silliness? Felician and I gave that folly up long ago. But I'm not saying that you will be the mother, Auntie. You will be a grandmother. Of all the...! Hanka! Do not smoke cigars in here! The curtains will need to be washed! Hanka! Do you hear me? Open the door! Tell me! Ls this true? - Tell me! - Yes. - You're not lying?! - No. - In front of the priest? Tell me! - It's the truth. As God is your witness?! As God is my witness! Then start packing! I will pay you until the first, then out! You hear me?! How tactful of you, Mother. Tactful? Tactful? I'm to be tactful?! How dare you speak of tact? You caused this scandal in the family home, and now we must pack and go to Nakgczw! - This is my business. - Your business? Insolence! Insolence! - To have a nobody throw this in my face! - And this nobody, would that be me? Your mother new all about Hanka from the beginning and accepted it? - For what purpose? - To keep you in the house. So that you stop running around. Hanka even got a raise out of it. Hanka got a raise because she was good at her work. That is just like Mother. - She is lying! - Me? Never! And do you know what I shall do now, Mother? I will marry Hanka! Why not. My gall bladder will burst in a moment. Felician, Felician! Do something. You're his father! Curse him! Hanka, drop those things. You're staying. For good. - I will never allow this! - That's what you think, Mother. God! God! What will I say when people ask about my daughter-in-law's family home? You can say that she comes from a hut. Felician! I beg you! I beg you! Say something! For once in your life! Something! Say something! Damn you all to Hell! Now! Immediately!... All of you! And a few generations after you! I curse you! Yes! I curse all of you! I can't take it, I can't take... Hush... Get up, get up. Why all this humiliation. Sit down Mother. It's going to be my way. You hear me, Mom? It's going to be my way. We'll all get down in this mud together. Sit down Hanka, sit next to Mother. This is your place now, you hear? Sit, don't move. Open the door, Auntie and say that both Dulski ladies are entertaining in the living room. Oh God... Please don't turn me out, Madam, I will never try to poison myself. OUT!!! Grandfather Felician cursed all of them for a few generations. I lived in a toxic family... Grandmother was toxic, Mother... I'm toxic too. You live out a few generations past in such a family. Memories, dreams, nightmares... It's like a second reality for me. To live the lives of a few generations... I'm envious. Don't be. I was always the one to hand out gifts on Christmas Eve. Well... Mela... Presents. Grandma. Oh, thank you very much... Thank you Santa. "Film in the Soviet Union". Thank you very much. There is a chapter on Chapaev. I expect there is. Dad. Oh my, it's so big. - Well? What do you think? - How cool... Mother. Thank you. Gabby. Wow, look. Look... what a sweet girl I was. How beautiful. You'll put it on when we go to the opera. Whatever... we'll go to the circus. Try it on. Let's see if it fits you. Try it. I'm very curious myself. Try it on. And now Hela and me. De Amicis's Heart. Would have preferred De Amicis's penis. And I got a camera. Then you can take a picture of me naked. It's too tight. I can't get it on. That's impossible. I've never been wrong. Let's go. As per tradition, - let's sing a Christmas carol. - Just sing quietly girls. What is it? Don't you know the words? We do, we do... We just don't want the neighbors to hear. Our Gabby got wider bosom by three centimeters, hips maybe even four. Well, well... Women sometimes put on weight. Especially in winter. You're so stupid. Women put on weight when they're pregnant. And Gabby is pregnant with our Zbiggie. Oh God, God... My God, my gall bladder will burst. You idiot. This is a true Christmas gift. She is from the people. Understand? From the people... I just hope she will want to marry him. Our Zbiggie is not the best candidate. God is born, all might is shaken He the Heaven's King lies naked. Fire freezes, brightness darkens He the Limitless takes limit, Born disdained yet worship given Mortal, yet the Lord eternal. The Word made flesh to Dwell among us. This is how Hanka's story could have ended. What do you know? Twenty thousand... Twenty thousand. What about Hanka? Hanka... Hanka... Hanka practically did not leave the servant's room... And he's not in prison? You will also have to pay a bribe, Auntie. You and your thief's cunning. - Is that what you think, Auntie? - I wouldn't trust you to hold a coin even. I can fix it so that your problem goes away, Auntie. - Really? - Yes. - For sure? - For sure. You see? I told you everything will be alright. Felician, leave us. Go to your room. Sit down... Close the door over there. - Tea? - Yes please. Was Zbyszko here? He was. - Did he agree? - He did. So, you are pleased, Auntie. Pleased about what? Hanka wants a thousand... In gold. The nerve. - And? Will you pay, Auntie? - What else can I do? She's threatening with lawsuits, alimony... - My gall bladder will burst in a moment. - So, see you tomorrow at the hospital. Yes, see you, see you. You're saving on the electric again, Auntie? Oh Jesus... One day, Mother came home with a woman I didn't know. She was shod, ugly and had two small cases with her. She went into Hanka's room... That's it... That's it. I don't know how long I stayed in bed... I woke up when it was dark... And then, my brother Zbyszko disappeared and never came back. Maybe that explains why I have no children. Bullshit! You just want to make a career out of the family scandal. This is about the ability to tell the truth. If I had cancer, I could make a work of art out of the chemotherapy treatment. My cancer is my family in which cannibalism was practiced. I had my entire insides devoured. What you're talking about is simple exhibitionism. Actually, exhibitionism is a great moral achievement of recent years. Only thanks to that do we have truth in our lives. You are more of a hypocrite than your grandmother ever was. Make a movie about your hypocrisy. And you don't have children because you have a revulsion to sex. Don't you worry, I'm sure your beloved son Zbiggie will win the election. - He's got excellent ratings. - And this is the daughter I had Mr. Swiss! You tell me, you are the Professor, how can you dream of a hallway which you've never seen before, huh? Everything happens for a reason... Dream is reality, reality is a lie, a lie is the truth. And so on. Who knows... Only I know... Only I know... I know, how two suitcases. Klara is aware of everything. She's the best in the city. The price is 300. A wedding would cost me less. If you need anything, Auntie, I'll be in the lounge above the cafe. - Why do you need two cases? - What if there are twins? Good day. And? She took the bait. I get five thousand. But this will kill her. Do you want to back out? She should sleep now. Hanka is covered in blood, the bed is covered in blood. The floor, the sheets. What have you done? Whatever have you done? I did what I was hired to do. Klara, go home immediately. It's all covered in blood. Everything. The bed... everything. It's going to spread. It'll spread to the carpet. Hanka's parents need to be paid off. - And Zbyszko, he might come back. - To the bank. We must hurry to the bank. Twenty two thousand. - Twenty two. - Twenty will suffice. Thank God. What's the emergency? A little sudden business? Yes. Must hurry. Thank you. Here, take it. And now, Auntie should go to the park and sit on a bench. Then, slowly walk home. Hanka will already be gone. Nobody will sue you, everything will be taken care of. I don't know how to thank you. Maybe you could sell us one of the flats, Auntie. Never. I run a respectable building. You may not be able to pay it off and now I have to make back what was taken from me. Go to your room. Nothing here for you. You're a hypocrite. What do you think? Where did that come from? From the floor here? From the servant's room? Nobody knows anything. The big silent treatment, right? Yes. That's my story. And him? He came to me. When he went to lie down in the servant's room, it all became clear to me. What? He is the son of Hanka and Zbyszko. - What? - He was born in Vienna, he is your uncle. Well if he's alive, then my movie is fucked. The called me "runt", I never knew why... But if you always knew the truth, why did you tell Grandma that she had Hanka's blood on her hands? Because only then I had her in my power. Not many people know anything about the hereditary soul. That's why it's so difficult to believe that man has two souls. When a person lives 50 years, only one pan of him exists half a century Melanie, because the second... because the second may be a million years old.
