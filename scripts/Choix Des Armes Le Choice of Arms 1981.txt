Kilarney January 10th - "Dear sir last year you and your wife saw my stud farm; at the time it was not for sale. Today, I'm forced.. to sell it, if you're still interested, please" etc, etc. That house! To the right. Too isolated. Just right for a hideout. No, we'll be spotted right away You have something else? Not for now. Get down! What's this shit? - Shut up and don't move! Just wait now, I'm unarmed And Ricky? He knows. Ricky is your long ... Wait! I will tell you when ... Wait ... Serge! Just a little longer... What do I do? - Wait ... Now! Oh, shit! Why? Serge... Serge! Serge... Serge... Oh my God! Serge... Serge! Mickey, we have to go right away. We'll have more information about the... We're just off for the day, We'll be back this evening. All right. Are you Durieux? Yes why? - You must come with me. What? - Serge is over there. Serge? Where? Come through the back. Well Roland, you might have knocked. You're brother had an accident. - Again? What is it this time? He got killed. He fucked off again, right? Well, I heard that Serge Oliver was busting out. A young punk told me. And you ran straight to my brother to tell him? Well, he kept talking about that guy Serge so... Okay, okay. After all that time... Bravo, let's hope everyone stays quiet. The Doctor is coming. Thanks Noel. And Nicole? She's okay, she'll be out for awhile. I didn't know where to go. Sorry I came here. His friend squealed on us to Sylvain Constantini. I am not interested. I know, but Sylvain is dead. If his brother knows I'm here, then it will all start over. You know what his brother is doing? Real estate. Listen, Serge. I'm going to take care of you. Stay here as long as you want. Want to go aboard with your friend? I can help you, but the all the rest doesn't concern me. I'll get you some blankets. He's scared shitless, no? Shut up. You don't know who Noel was! Constantini... Sylvain Constantini. It takes me back 20 years. Two months from retirement. Hi Raymond. You must know. No, know what? I'll call you in 3 hours. That was the doctor, what's going on? Serge is here. Shit. Where's the other one? Are you out of your mind? I'm doing nothing wrong. Swell horses! You must not be seen. Come back inside and stay there! No, I'm fed up, fed up. I'll take care of your car. Come, I'll take you back. By force? I'd like to see that. Okay, you choose, you stay inside or you leave and shut your trap and never come back here. You think you scare me? If it's that way, I'll go to Paris for a spell. How could you trust that guy? - Serge is dying. Hello yes, Serge just passed away. No bullshit, don't hang up. I'm Mickey, let me talk to Noel. But I just spoke to him. He must help me leave, he promised me this morning. No, no, you can see me, but I'm coming to see him. Yes, I'm coming to see him, what's the matter with you? Why are you all so scared? If he doesn't help me you're in deep shit. You have to go. - I'm coming with you, You shouldn't. - You need me, I must come. You're ok? - Yeah. He's here already. You see we had to hurry. Gentlemen, I heard the radio I know why you're here and I have nothing to say. You wanted to see me? Well you've seen me. Now please leave. Goodbye gentlemen. Impressive that Durieux? We are too polite with these people. Wait. Don't move! Let me go! I'll start here. There's brains up there. He betrayed me, the bastard, tipped the pigs off. The jerk, bastard, the son of a bitch. What possessed you? I arrested three, like him, once. Durieux, we are going to search your house now. Henriette, please show these people in. Thank you. Come. We'll find nothing. Why say that! Hello Lilianne, where is Fernand? He's not inside, come back tomorrow. At least you could take off your shoes. It's better when the mare keeps us awake. I shall I meet you at Orly. I must go see Constantini. I can't help it, sorry. You're hurting my feelings. Me, involved with such scum? I know nothing about my brother that asshole. He got mixed up with these punks and their shady deals. Do you think a man in my position can get involved with this scum? Or with a jerk like Mickey? I hope that Serge is not dragging you into this again. I dropped my brother, you and I, we're different. Yeah, even if at one time we were rivals. No, Noel, I don't know who tipped off my brother. I can't help you find, Mickey. Sorry. Know what? You make me sick. Mickey...Mickey! Shit. What are you doing here? Just resting. Knocked out again, last night? And you're quite healthy. Go, leave. Wait, wait, calm down. Wait? Do you know where Ricky might be? I said you should leave. Are you listening? What happens to all the guys when they leave? What then? Go to hell, Mickey! Do you realize what's going on? Let me see. - Well? Leave. Now. Shit, please, leave. Are you are afraid, I'll talk. And what, you turn you in? Don't be ashamed, I'll stay with other people. Everyone makes me sick. Knock-out in the first round! What are you doing here? Who are you? What do you want? It's for her. Look where you're going! Fuck all gang members! Sorry, I didn't see you I didn't mean it. Dany... Mickey... Here's our youngest, look what we have here. She's my litte peewee, look who is here. Notice him? Look. Great, she's started to cry. We'll set a place up for you with the kids. For the groceries. Marc? Simon? Tonio? Ricky? I haven't seen them for ages. Last time was at your match. You were a star, remember? Stop or I'll break you. - Ok, I'm broken. Did you get your set? - No, not yet. You want a set? What? You mean a real one? With gold sticks if you want. Come on. Come. Careful or I'll shoot you. You shouldn't have ratted to the cops!. So I want money for my troubles, it's normal. Get out of here! I think it just fair..no? Let me go... Let me go! Get out of here! Jacques, you okay? - Call a doctor, quick! I'm sorry Jacques, really. No harm done, it's nothing. I'll be back you pricks! I'll be back and I'll kill you all! Watch your asses! No gun permit, of course. "I wanted to catch the driver who was speeding," Is that right? Good evening, Mr. Durieux. You must be in contact with Serge Olivier. Anyway, no gun permit, a runaway car in a crowd. It's enough to throw you in jail. You're going to set me free immediately. What? I said you will let me go. In '52 your stupidity caused a double murder on Rue Pasteur. Stop it, Durieux! Please! In '55... - Stop it! You all know very well that I'm blameless. I know, Bonnardot, but not everyone will buy it. I don't know what's going on between you, Serge Olivier and Mickey. You going back to your old ways? That's OK, I'll get you, the three of you! Nicole, you must go to a hotel for a few days. No, no way. - Please, Nicole. You can't stay here, he's coming back. And you? What do you want me to do? I can't sit here and do nothing. I can't wait for this nutter day and night. I don't have a choice. We have to leave Durieux free. He'll look for his old contacts eventually. So we'll sit and wait. Yeah, once again the informers will do our jobs. Well? Bonnardot, it's been 30 years of success. You choose, you're free. Well, I'm leaving. Wait, I'll see you out. Nicole! Nicole, don't be that way - What way? You want me to go, I obey, that's all. Well Grangier, we won't be away that long, goodbye. Goodbye, Mr. Durieux. Sorry, but it's the first time we're apart, so, it hurts Nicole, my darling, I love you so much. Mr. Durieux, sorry. I just saw the mare and she is restless Let me go and see what's wrong. Go, I'll take care of her. Noel, you must go. Go quickly and come back quickly. I think she's okay, just cranky. Well, don't leave her alone. You can count on me. Hurry up fatso. - Go fuck yourself. Here. Thank you. Look at you, moneyman. Oh shit. Come on fatso, lets go in. - Go fuck yourself. Come on, meathead, you go first. Hands off you asshole. You don't scare me, you jerk! Jerk. I see your gun... think that scares me? Do something, you shithead. Don't just stand there. Raoul! Grab your rifle and come here quick. Now you run you cowards. Fucking bitches! Come on.. No Raoul, no, don't give in. Stop it, stop it! They're asshole, jerks! - Shut her up or I'll shoot. I told you, quiet. She's not listening! Quiet or you're going to get it cunt! Alright, go! Go ahead, leave. It's suffiicient, but it might not be in the house before midnight. You can go to bed. She's all we have. We let Durieux slip. You go to bed. There it is. Okay, stop it now. Already here? Too bad... Bye honey, see you soon. - You're coming? No we can't, goodnight. - Goodnight. "Constantini = Bitch, see you soon, Mickey" No. 2 ... the third to the left ... Here he is, on the avenue. No. Take the parallel to the right. Stop ... We have arrived. I know him, Roland Davout. Drugs for school kids. Illegal aliens, the works. Don't worry, I'll find him. Get out! Listen to me, find Mickey for me. You high or what? Understand what I say, punk? You have to find Mickey. Stop it. Hey you... - What! You shut up. You're ok? Stop! Stop! Hi, Davout... Stop. Leave me alone! Come with me, friend. What are you stupid? Let him stay! Let him stay, I said. Don't move. Go back inside. This is not important. Go! When Mickey escaped, you ratted on him? For that? Now you don't know where he is. They'll hit you until you find out. And you? Me too, I want to find Mickey. They have food. The cupboards are filled with preserves. The car in the garage is full of gas. No one knows this house, not even my wife. Andrew can you stay with him? - No problem. Goodbye, Noel -Thanks, Andre. You sure you won't need me? No thanks. Well... You'll need this. Call me. Would you like something to drink? I need a hit. Or I won't talk. Thanks a lot. What is your name? Ricky. Mickey is your friend? He's my best friend. Then tommorrow, you'll tell me everything. I don't know where Mickey is. Alright. Was he in your gang before? A gang is always there when you need help. You always go back to it, whether you like it or not. The first time, it was here. One day they had a falling out with Bebert, there. Bebert wanted to become a chief. His thing was stealing weapons. And Mickey? Oh, he didn't care. He was already boxing. He even trained at night and he would punch hard.. Six victories in a row, in one day. Then one night, he had his first K.O. in the fifth round. I go to the locker room. He seemed okay. He was getting dressed. He says he has to make a call. I've never seen him again. That's his photo. After he stopped fighting, the gang was never the same. Some were working, some were ...still in the joint. It's hard when a gang disbands. Do these move? - Yes. Well? - Yes, quite. Enough? On the 17th floor. But Jose lives with his folks. I don't think Mickey would show up there. Are you going to mess with them? Oh please stop sulking. It's nice, you like it? Are you her father? You son of a bitch Son of a bitch. Here's where we played soccer. Here turn right.. Why the hell are you still here? Will you get out of here, or you'll see. Get out of here. You little creep. Those bastards! Look what they built here. A parking lot. Fuck! Mickey was the goalie. Was he good? Played with all his soul. Such passion. Provided you don't hit the corners. Worthless. Whistled all the time. I still don't know why he did that. Sounds strange, but that's Mickey. I think I'm beginning to understand him. Even all his hopes and dreams? Can't know those. What makes you so sure? Beginning to understand you as well. Is Raoul here? Did he take the car? When you steal a car, you have to change the license plate! Dany was living here, but I don't know which door. What's his last name? I forget. Would you know it if you saw it written? Here he is. I don't see it here. ...but I'm not sure. Let's keep going. Here he comes. Hello, Grangier? Yes, how are you? Any calls? And the mare? She's very restless? Since when? Okay, I'll be there soon. Hello, Inspector Bonnardot, Nicole Durieux speaking. I want you to stop having me followed. Well, you two figure it out. Listen ... talk to him. It's for you, come. Come. It's for you. Hello, Inspector Savin speaking. Well I was asked to do it. Yes, it was him. Well, I thought... Okay, I'll stop. Okay. I'm putting him with Davout, they belong together. No, don't. As you wish. Well, you can't be seen here. So stay in the car, while we look for Dany. If he's there, we'll bring Mickey back to you. I'm getting out of this. I don't want to go through with this. You want us to handle this? - No, it's not worth it. You're wrong, you'll see when he causes larger problems. Let's at least scare him. -No, let's not. It will only excite him more. Well, you're the boss. In this case you must do things differently. I know Durieux already asked for help. And to whom. Nicole Durieux was seen on the way to the farm. I'm going, it's my job. So go, stay up all night. I don't care. You seem to enjoy it. Where is he? Tell me where he is! I don't know. No, stand up. Please wait, not right now, I can't. He's a bastard and I'm going to kill him. Kill him. Stop it. You're nuts, he didn't do anything to you. Oh yea? Prowling around my kid? What do you want with us? - How did he find her? What? - No one knows about her. I don't know. Explain, instead of screaming. I'm going to turn off the heat. Hello, I'd like to speak to Nicole Durieux, please. When was that? Thanks. Hello. Yes, Noel, wait. Hello, Nicole? It's me. I have your wife and I mean business. You hear me? I understand. Wait she's there? With you? All I have to do is shoot. No, wait, Mickey. Wait. Look at her. What is she wearing? She is beautiful, isn't she? I'm madly in love with her. What's this he is saying? Without her, I'm lost. If you hurt her, I'm gone. Mickey. Totally gone... For the past two days, I've wanted to get you. I've seen lots of places. Even where you used to play soccer. Now, I feel I know you. You know why I called my wife? To tell her I was quitting, to tell her she was right. There are other ways than shooting at each other. Listen, I'm far away, but am coming as soon as possible. So you decide. Will you wait for me? I'll be right there. What did he say? - Nothing, nonsense. That's Noel at 12 in Marseille. Noel, keep the keys. No, it's not necessary. - Go. No, I've never seen her before. All of a sudden I had to have her. But jail is not that bad. And the baby's mother? She commited suicide 3 months ago. I'm not to blame, I barely knew her. I fucked her one night and only that one night. Then she told me I knocked her up. But I had other things to do at the time. I never saw her again. She never told anyone that I was the father. That why...how did Noel find her? How old is she? I saw the car. The mare is not well. I'll take care of it. Go on home. You won't need me? No, thanks. I know her well. Also there was a call for you from Ireland. You must call. Thank you. Good night. That mare kept us awake many a night. If she's sick, let's go and see her. Easy...easy. What's the matter? This time she'll need a vet. Let's call him. He lives 10 minutes from here. So what? You must hide... Okay then, all right. Police! Don't move! I thought it was you. It's your fault. It's all your fault. Who are you? What's going on? I'm sorry, let me say... I said freeze, he started shooting. She came out, I'm sorry. You're letting him go? I have no charges against him. - But, he's a witness! Witness to what? His wife's death. It's you... You and your methods. We all could have been working together, safely. Don't worry, I'll take the blame and early retirement. So it's your turn to play. No no, hush, hush. We're going for a drive, you'll see At night it's beautiful and everyone is asleep. And we're up, and we can go as fast as we like. You'll see. You're going to catch cold. You're right. It's nice. Come ... What is this? Wait, I have to put her to bed. We need money as soon as possible, this is Durieux we're talking about. - What? Now? Yes.. Come on, you piece of shit! What about dogs? We do not even have sugar. We would need sugar, some sugar. I have a better idea. Take the wheel and leave the engine running. Understand? Get in! "Will the military? After failure its government ... " "... just watch the neighbourhood tour and public buildings. " "Only the good will of the citizens ..." "... will emerge from this crisis." "If they had waited a week ..." "... to clean the streets ..." "... armed elements ..." Mickey just tried to rob a bank. "In neighbourhoods riddled, bombed houses ... " "... in the deserted streets, crowded Glass and rubble ... " "... will require weeks to return to live there. " According to witnesses, Durieux picked him up. Durieux. Why? "In accepting the cease-fire might be able to know ... " "... who was responsible of the massacre ... " "... since after 2 months of fighting there were nearly 800 dead. " "... this time will not be easy to forget that ..." Durieux, why? Maybe because he's already done this from '42 to '44. During the war and then on his own afterwards. Tell me what your informers told you. Who asked for help Durieux? Get the hell out of here! Help me, you bastard! Help me to find him! Help me! Help me ... Hey! Hey! Wait! The lesson is not finished yet. What Durieux did, others did too. But they never stopped. Andre Dalby ... Jean Mucchielli ... Sure, that means nothing to you, but to me, yes. Durieux went to see them ... ... as I knew he would. Thanks to my methods. I even know something else: Jean Mucchielli has a house near Paris that no one knows. Hurts like hell. What the hell are you doing with me here? If I only knew. What did you do to my wound? Did you wash your hands first? Go ahead, keep talking nonsense. You're right ... I'm fed up...sick! How did you know I had a daughter? I didn't know. I knew where you hid out, nothing more. I saw you with Ricky. In front of her house. I don't know what you're talking about. My God! That's why I went back to your house, otherwise I would have never gone there. Why didn't you tell me on the phone? I do not know, I was afraid for her. Then you talked to me. You told me to wait so I did. I only wanted to wait, do you understand? Then there was the police who started shooting. Okay, go ahead ... More ... Now tell me it's not your fault. Tell me. And this? Is this not your fault? And you? You're innocent, perhaps? There is a car in the garage. Get out of here. Oh yeah, that's it, leave. I'm better off alone. I'm better off alone. Go on, get out of here! Oh shit. Get out, Duroix! There're here! Stop, it for heaven's sake! Stop! Don't shoot anymore! Stop! That's an order! Aim well, this well be your last bullet. Get up! Up! Up! I'm taking him. Let me go. You drive. Shut the door. Go! Call the station. Have you killed anyone before my wife? No. .. Stop. Get out. Get out. Walk. These five shots will always ring in your head. Who is it? -Mucchielli. Hello. Are you ready? - Yes. We must be in Le Havre at 8 o'clock. We have plenty of time. What is your name? Karine.
