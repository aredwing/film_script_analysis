"An officer was found "in his drawers, handcuffed to the jungle gym, in his own handcuffs." Yup. But you see, that was a diversion, okay? So my fellow officers could move in with the least amount of resistance. - Back at you. - Yeah. It seems you often use that exact same tactic. I'm gonna do whatever I have to do to make the arrest. I mean, I don't care if I have to use chewing-gum wrapper, to slip past intricate alarm systems, to bust up a stolen car ring. - That's what I'm gonna do. - Bullshit. - That's what you are. - When was your last collar? My last collar was... - When was your last collar? - Guys! Guys! - Tonight is the big night, right? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Tonight is. Yes, it is. Tonight, I make my Ashley an honest woman. You mean, now she can finally tell how funny-looking you are. Sorry. What is with y'all? You're supposed to be happy for a brother. We are, man. I mean, I am. We are happy for you. We're just sad for her. Suck my dick. Anyway, dawg, so where you gonna propose at? You know what I mean? You gonna take her to the beach... Check it out, write it down. Wait until sunset, propose when the sun is like over the horizon, you know what I mean? It's romantic and it's quiet and it's just like you and her. You know what I mean? The sand and all that beautiful... - Dude. - Sorry. Sorry, I was just reminiscing. That's how I proposed to my second wife. She was a fat-ass, though. She looked nothing like Ashley. That's a fine piece of ass. Bang it on me. You got one more time. One more time. But seriously, I got a proposal that's so hot, I'm about to sweep this woman right off her feet. Are you okay? These are for you. - You look wonderful. - Thank you. - What are you doing? - I'm doing the right thing. We've known each other for about a year now, Ashley, I can't imagine my life before you, and I definitely don't want to imagine my life without you. You complete me, baby. I'm just kidding. I was watching cable last night. I knew I'd get you with that one. No, but seriously, seriously. I love you with all my heart. Oh, my God! Will you marry me? Oh, my God. Come on now, girl, before I get rheumatism in my knee. Yes. Yes. Yes. - Oh, my gosh. - I like to make her sweat it out. Oh, baby, it's so beautiful. Come here. Can I get something to drink for you two? Yes. We'll take a bottle of Les Paymoo Strang Franais, I don't believe we carry that... He's kidding. Just bring us your best champagne. Yeah. Strang. Oh, my gosh, we have so much planning to do. Where are we gonna have it? What am I gonna wear? Who's gonna be our planner? Oh, babe, babe, babe. Calm down, okay? Calm down. We've got plenty of time to plan. I need to know, are you ready for tomorrow? Yes. Yeah. Our train leaves for LA tomorrow at 12:00. Cool. I can't wait to break the news to your parents. Wait till they meet me. Yeah. Your champagne. Now, this is how a man should be introduced to your family. Do you know, you gotta hide this until we announce it, though. Right. Right. Yeah. Hey, you think we should do it on Thanksgiving? We'll just have to find the appropriate time. Well, you're right. You're right. We should just let it happen naturally. Baby, even if you don't click with my family, will you still love me? Of course. I mean, of course. Hey, remember this: love conquers all. And I love you. I love you. But you know deep down inside I'm gonna click with your family. - Do I? - I mean, come on, look at me. What family could resist these boyish good looks? - Okay. - I mean, seriously, look at me, okay. I can borrow a cup of sugar from any white family on this block. You know this. You are so stupid. - Let's go. - Let's go. Mama. Hey, Daddy. Well, it's so nice to meet you, baby. Ashley, you didn't tell me he was this fine. Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you. Yeah, well, I told my daughter about putting my business out in the streets. Have to remember never to fold under questioning. - Daddy. - Jake. Would you leave that boy alone? I was just having a little fun with him. Come on, boy, put your bags in. You guys put your bags in the back of the trunk. Girl, I like what you did with your hair. That's mine. Duck hunting. Oh, that's what I figured. Yeah. Go on, put your bags in there. I was holding those for my boy, back home. We were... You wanna... Wanna just help me with this, so we can... You know what? You're good. Okay, there we go. All right, you can get in the car now. So, Mike, what do you do for a living, son? Daddy, don't start. Ashley, baby, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I have the right to know what the nigga that's popping my daughter's coochie does for a living. So, son, what is it that you do for a living? I'm a cop. What? Ashley, you didn't tell me this motherfucker was a pig. I don't think it mattered anymore. Jake, come on now, that was many years ago. Wait, wait, wait, what was years ago? Jake did some time in the joint for attempted murder of a police officer. That's all. It wasn't no motherfucking attempted murder. It was self-defense. - Daddy... - I don't want to hear it, Ashley. Whatever is said or done while you and this sell-out are around, it stays right here. You understand me? You got that, pig? - Huh? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. - We're gonna talk. - Shit. So, welcome to our humble home, Michael. Oh, yeah. This is nice. This is nice. This reminds me of my grandmama's house. - You making fun of my decorations, boy? - Oh, no, it's not even like... It's okay, young blood. It's okay. But just remember, the struggle continues. You want something? Soda pop? Beer? Doughnut? - You just go ahead and get comfortable. - Is this Italian? Yeah, just... - It's smooth, you know. - It's cool. Just glide into it. So, Ashley, how's work, baby? It's going really good. I just got a raise. - Oh, that's wonderful, baby. - Yeah, that's great, baby. So, Mike, how's work? - Kill any niggas lately? - Jake. I'm just asking him a couple of questions. No, I can't say I have. - I'm curious, Mike. - Jake. Baby, let me just talk to the young man. Why would a black man in America wanna be a cop? I mean, you couldn't think of nothing better to do? Maybe be a doctor, a lawyer or maybe even a gangster rapper. I mean, at least they make more money than a sleazy-assed pig. Daddy. All right. All right. All right. It's gonna take me a minute to get used to this pig shit. Anyway, Michael, what are your intentions for my beautiful daughter right here? Well, actually, Ashley and I, we've been seeing each other for quite some time. Oh, what's bubblating, family? I was with y'all all day, okay? - Hey, June Bug. - Hey, June Bug. Hiya, sis, how're you doing? Looking all good, like a video girl, like you've been sprouting up and everything. Hey, June Bug. So, what you home for, Thanksgrubbing or something? Yeah. How Diego treating my bitch? You still love me there and everything? It's fine. Who this nigga? My boyfriend, Michael. How're you doing, June... Anyway, Mom, my stomach killing me. You know, I ain't ate in like three days. That's what jail do to a brother in the drab house, keeping me starving. I'm going to the kitchen, no, you ain't gotta follow me or nothing. I'll be right back. Hold on, June Bug. Don't be sticking your fingers in my pots. I'm not done yet. Come here, boy. Don't let me have to break your fingers off. So, Mike, you were saying. Yeah, like I was saying, you know, Ashley and I, we've been seeing each other for quite some time, we actually have a little something we'd like to share with you guys. Hey, nigga, we gotta ride. We gotta go to the stizzore. Mom ain't got enough flizzour and the stizzore closes in an izzour, so you gotta ride with me right now. Can't be riding around here by myself, playa. You know what I'm saying? They out to get me. I won't be the only target. Let's go. - I'm tired. - Just go. Go on, Michael. Go on. June Bug gonna show you around. Jesus Christ, Ashley. Where did you find that sorry motherfucker from? It's crazy out here, man. Right there. That's where we making our kids fight the shit. You got kids? Hell, no, I look like making my kids fight? Oh, that's where the big homie got shot. Shot 17 times in the face. Took them all, too, like a champ. - They call him Bullet Head. - Yeah, with the bullets, that makes sense. Oh, snap. That's the old rock house, right there. I used to get my serve on in that motherfucker, pushing big weight. - You, right there? - Yeah. - Big weight, huh? - Yeah. - You did? - Me, man.

I don't trust no nigga that don't smoke. What, you a cop or something? Hell, no. No, I'm good. You're good? You ain't good till you hit this. - What do you coughing for? - I got asthma. - What kind of fool don't smoke? - You know, I... Me. - Me. - I don't trust you, man. Who this fool right here? Now you stay leaned up, in case the bullets scatter over there. - What's going on? What's going on? - Fool thinks he can just roll up on me? - No, I'm planning to put in work. - Relax, man. Whoa!

I dedicated 30 years of my life to the Movement. Fighting oppression at the hands of a cold-blooded, ruthless oppressor. You understand? Back in the day, I was a high-ranking soldier in the Party. You understand? And I didn't raise my daughter to be with the very motherfucker that I used to fight with on the streets. Who murdered and killed a lot of my comrades in the line of duty. But I want you to know, that I will kill you before I let you be with my daughter. You understand? Hey, guys, come and eat. Come on, let's eat. I think we're having pork chops. Come on.

Before I pop another cap up in your ass. Big son of a bitch. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine, he started choking me by surprise, I... Not you, asshole. I'm talking to my daughter. You all right, baby? I'm fine, Daddy. I'm fine. And you're supposed to be a goddamn cop. The shit I do for your love. You hungry? So, your dad really wanted you to marry this Malik guy? Yeah. I mean, his dad and my dad, they were both in the Party together. And it kind of seemed like the perfect match, you know? - Up until he robbed that bank. - What? Yeah, he's been in jail for the past five years. - How much time did he get? - Quadruple life. And this is the man your dad wanted you to marry? Yeah. I love you, Ashley. But I ain't robbing no banks for your ass or your daddy's approval. Ashley. Don't forget where you are, young lady. Now, this thing came in the mail for you today. - What is it? - Some kind of tape. Didn't have a return address on it. Why not pop it in and see what's on it? Come on, baby, break this up right here, let's make a little space. I can never get comfortable on this couch. Where'd that come from? They don't even serve corn in here. Look, baby, it's Malik. Hey, baby. It's Malik. Daddy, do we have to watch this? How come you block all my calls at every residence you move to? Ashley, let's just watch it and see what he has to say, it might be something really nice. And return all my letters. Unread. I just thought maybe you want to holler at a nigga. Thanks to this new videogram program, put together by Governor Schwarze-nigger, I'm able to send you this small visual massage. Just for you. They say it helps keep us grounded in reality. You probably wondering why I sent you this. 'Cause you got a big old, fat, juicy ass, girl, and the motherfucking titties. Them motherfuckers float over my head every night when I'm dreaming. Plus, Daddy just wanna make sure his baby girl all right. Me? I'm cool, you know what I'm saying? Long as there ain't no crooked cop trying to assassinate me. Getting shanked by a nigga. Motherfucker trying to... You know, inmates sodomize a motherfucker, treat me like I'm some kind of fairytale shit. You know what I'm saying? Or a motherfucker get some food poisoning, with all that bullshit they serving down there. Still trying to figure out how the fuck I get corn in my shit, and they ain't even had that motherfucking shit in here. Other than that, prison's been a positive, positive experience. I never told you what went wrong with the "alleged" bank robbery. You know, it wasn't the "alleged" bank robbery that got me quadruple life, no. It was the amount of explosives and arsenic they found at the crib. They tried to charge me with a terrorist act. I ain't no motherfucking terrorist! I don't fit the motherfucking description, George Bush, boy! Anyway, I just opened up 'cause, I guess it's my institutionalized way of saying I'm sorry. You knows, what we had, baby, was special. You remember that time, your high school prom, when I came to pick you up? And everybody like, "Who the fuck this old dude? "You know, coming to grab a little shorty," right? Like I was some kind of child molester or some shit. You know what I'm saying? Remember I bust caps in the air, and all them little bitches ran? All right, I took you down to the Bonaventure. And I taught you how to do it tiger-style. I will never forget that shit, and I know you won't, either. Power of duct tape. Girl, there ain't a day go by in this motherfucker I don't think about you. You know what I'm saying? When I'm shanking the shit out of a motherfucker, I'm thinking about you, girl. Yeah, when I'm squirting the motherfucker with lighter fluid all between that motherfucker's cell, and I drop that match on that bitch... I'm thinking about you, girl. When I'm in this motherfucking cell, by myself late at night. You know what I'm saying? You know, I'm not really by myself, 'cause I got my bitches, you know what I'm saying? I got my motherfucker... Petroleum jelly. $1.99. Commissary. They got deals up in this bitch. And I start beating up on the defendant. Guilty, guilty, guilty. I'm thinking about you, girl. Daddy, please shut this off. Guard, get in here. He's doing it again. Guard? Oh, man, what the fuck you want? Every time a nigga try to get a jack session here, here come your tight-suit-wearing motherfucking ass. - Put your hands up against the wall. - Fuck, no. Put your hands down, where the hell you going? Nigga, you gonna jack it off for me? - Get down on... - Pull the... What the fuck you looking at, you bubble-eyed bastard? Cover's on the side of the couch, Keystone Kop. And, Ashley, I think it's about time you made your way upstairs to go to bed. Tiger-style. Whatever. Michael? Baby. - What are you doing here? - What do you think? - What about your daddy? - What about him? I'm a big girl now. Big girls do big people things. Baby. - Really, we should... - Should what? - We should keep this PG-13. - Okay. - Baby, be gentle. - I will. That's it. Wake it up, asshole. It's breakfast. You might want to put that thing away. 'Cause we don't want no hard dicks at the breakfast table. - Good morning, baby. - Good morning, baby. Good morning. Okay, Michael, this is my grandma and grandpa. Oh, great, okay, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins. No, baby, this is my mama's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Brown. Yeah, and you get that shit right. Very nice to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Brown. - Glad to meet you, too, son. - Very nice to meet you, Patrick. You'll have to excuse her, she's a little senile. - What? - No, no. It's okay, it's okay. He's a nice young man. Too bad you couldn't have met a nice young man. Now I've said something to you before about that shit. Don't come over here and start no shit with me. - Not today, please, Papa. - Come on, Papa, it's Thanksgiving. You need to shut up. Your man ain't about shit, either. Your daddy about to get his old light-skinned ass whooped. - That's what's gonna down... - Paul will beat you like... Hey, hey! Can't we just be civil for five minutes? This is Michael's first visit with us. You want the young man to think we a bunch of lunatics? We is. Yeah, you're right. What is it you do for a living, Mike? Somebody pass me the bacon. I'm a police officer. - As in, "cop"? - Yes. - Might be nice to have a cop in the family. - Wonderful. - Really? - Yeah, really. Yeah. I've got a couple of moving violations, maybe you could kind of... We can talk about that later, you know, 'cause I don't do that for everybody. - Yeah, he doesn't really do that. - It's really not... You know, we can talk about that later. Good morning, y'all, what's up, what's up? Good morning. Hey, June Bug! Have a look at all the senior sexy in here. - What's that I smell? - Nothing. Bullshit! That's reefer I smell. You've been smoking reefer without your granddad again? No, Grandpa, you know I wouldn't do that to you. I saved you some. - Some of that biblical-type mind... - Hey, hey, hey. Careful what you say now. You know, we got the cops in here. Babylon is in the house. Five-O. - Morning. - Morning, neez. Kind of uncomfortable with me sitting this close, ain't it? Shoulder to shoulder. You're used to me being in the back seat, locked up, handcuffed. Do something now. Do something now! Anyway, before I was so cop-fully interrupted... Later on, at the dinner we's having tonight, the Thanksgiving one. Right, I was gonna announce my engagement to Lupe, my mail-order bride, I got her over there from like Monte... Like one of them old... She's like from places where they don't... You know, where they be speaking other than what I say. Like I say this, and they say something else. Unfortunately, before we had a chance to... Consummate. - What, Mama? The word you told me... - Consummate. Before we got a chance to get together, she ran off with Hector, the gardener. - That dirty bitch. - Mama. Talking about she was more comfortable with him, you know, she says, you know, she's all happy and stuff now probably. Keeping it pimping like Daddy. That's what I'm gonna do. Keep it pimping like Daddy from now on. I ain't... All that love shit... Like you said, Daddy, after the motherfucking... "Ten years, fuck the bitch," remember that? Daddy was like, "After 10 years, what the fuck I need her for? "Your mama barely got by," you remember you was me telling me about that. You were like, "She was cool, but it wasn't the way..." You remember? Hey, you know, Ashley and I, we kind of have an announcement of our own. - We've been dating for quite some time. - You know what? I'm done eating. Yeah, I'm tired, too, man. I'm feeling sleepy right now. Grandpa, you wanna go do that? - I'm tired. - Yeah, let's go do that. I'm right behind you. Don't you all just drop the dishes in the sink, rinse them off first, okay? We know, we know, Mama, we know. I don't believe we've met. We'll be right back with Dark Wolf, part of our Thanksgiving Day horror marathon. Well, this is some marathon. Yeah. Excuse me. Would you help me with a little something in the back? I'd be happy to. Oh, pussy, that's it. Oh, it's sure on, Daddy! You gonna give me some head, too? - Did your grandma... - Don't ask. Yeah, you know, everybody was out there waiting for the goddamn turkey, I burned the whole goddamn turkey. It had the stuffing and the plastic all stuck up inside the goddamn thing. Oh, my Lord! Why'd you bring that shit up right now? I thought my daddy was never gonna leave you alone about that one, boy. Yeah, well, he hasn't, he brought it up earlier. Which brings me to my next point. You see the way in which my father treats you? - Yeah, I see that. - You don't like it, do you? Never have. Where you going with this, baby? You're treating Michael the same way, Jake. - No, it ain't the same. - Yes, it is. No, it ain't. Goddamn it, it ain't. Now, that boy's a stinking-ass cop, and you know how I feel about cops. Oh, come on, now. You need to get over that. You know, you are much too old to still be stuck in all that revolutionary, seize-the-time black power crap. Now, I know damn well this ain't coming from the same woman who used to march side by side with me and had the big-ass afro, the pick with the fist on it, and that damn dashiki, I know you not talking no shit. Well, if you haven't noticed, I moved on, brother. You know, I joined the work force. What's that got to do with the struggle, baby? It's a different world today, Jake. You got everybody wanting to be a thug instead of a man. You ought to be glad she not walking up in here with some gang-banger named Poop Dog, with his pants hanging half off his ass. Well, baby, ain't nothing wrong with that, that's the way they wear their pants today, - that's the style. - Oh, please. Please, if we'd have had it your way, she'd have ended up married to that damn Malik, then what? She'd be his ninth baby mama by now. She'd be raising the child all by herself, while he's stuck in the joint doing life. - Quadruple life. - Exactly. You know, you ought to be glad she walked up in here with a man got a job, who seem to be about something. Jake, baby, you know, you keep this up, all you gonna do is push Ashley further and further away from the both of us. Better not nobody say nothing about my potatoe salad, okay? Took me three days to make this, I don't wanna hear no, "Who made the potatoe salad?" Or it's gonna be on. Okay, okay. Yeah, so, Ashley, what's up with you and Michael? I mean, y'all talking marriage, babies, or what? - Maybe. - Well, I think he's a very nice young man. - I think he's a keeper. - I think so, too. I just get so upset that Daddy and him aren't getting along, you know? Sweetie-pie, you can't be with who your daddy like. Girl, I can't think of one boyfriend I had that Daddy did like. The last one I had that he liked was Malik. - Now that ought to tell you something. - Right. Is that boy still locked up? - Four life sentences. I think so. - Oh, goodness! Baby, you know when your mama and daddy first got together, I thought your daddy was a real piece of shit, but she up and married him anyway. - Thank you, Mama. - You're welcome, baby. You know what, baby? As long as he hitting that spot like he's supposed to, you know everything is all right. Where your daddy at? Mr. Brown? Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown. Go, go, go! Ain't this part a bitch? The boy did fumble the ball on the one yard line. How in the hell do you drop the ball on the one yard line? - Damn. - Boy. I done told you about cussing in other people's houses. Get your little ass out of here. I wonder where the hell he get that shit from. Probably from you, you ignorant ass. - Keep talking, wheelchair bitch. - And what, punk? And I'm gonna whoop off on your old senior citizen ass like your step-daddy should have, you son of a bitch. You freckle-faced bitch. Hey, y'all come on now, it's Thanksgiving. Get this pussy out of my face. You better give thanks that I don't whoop off on your old, ancient, last-supper ass. - Baby. - Any time, junior. - Okay. - Any time! Grandpa. Damn. Dinner's ready, y'all. Y'all think y'all can stop fighting long enough so we can eat? I'll let him slide that long. Come on, go, go, go. I'm going to take the batteries out of your pacemaker and hide your wheelchair. Take this battery, bitch. Scott Stevens open in the wide out... Oh, and it's a completed pass to Stevens! Right on his fingertips. Good game. Approaching the red zone. And it looks like it's going to be a real ballgame today, folks. Let's bless the table. All right. Y'all weren't gonna say no grace without me, right? June Bug, sit your crazy ass down. Let's bless our table. Bow our heads. Dear heavenly Father, thank you for yet another Thanksgiving together. Thank you for my entire family, as well as our new extended family member, Michael. We thank you for this food, and we pray that the hands that prepared it are blessed. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen, daughter. - Amen. Let's grub, let's grub! Get back into hearing amen and all that stuff. And whatever come after "A" and "men..." June Bug, get your fingers out the turkey. In front of people, don't do it? - What's wrong with you? - Everything. These candy yams look delicious. Yes. My mama made them. They are so good. Thank you, baby. Aren't you gonna try some of my honey-roasted ham? - I'm afraid I don't eat pork, ma'am. - Don't eat pork? A black man that don't eat pork is a traitor to his race. Don't be rude, boy. Go on and eat some of the ham. The ham is good. Got cloves in it. Yeah, just try a little taste. Yeah, eat up. Go on, just take a tiny little piece. All right, just for you. Just a little piece. Just a little piece. There you go. Baby, that ain't enough to even get a good taste. Come on and try this ham. Come on. - Yes, shove it in his mouth. - Yeah. - Chew, nigga. - All right. Get used to that. Chew. Don't be bullshitting with it. It's good. It's real good. Good. Anybody else want some ham? - No. - No, thank you, Mom. No. I can't do it now. - No. - No, thank you. - Love you, Grandma. - Give that to the guest. - Lil' Ray, that's enough. - But that's all I want. You better eat all of them vegetables up or your stomach be hurting and you'll be backed up. Potatoe salad. Now that's my favorite right here. Who made the potatoe salad? This motherfucker... - Oh, shit. - Oh. Why, huh? Why, nigga? You don't walk into a fast-food restaurant and ask who's on fries, do you? Do you waddle up into Roscoe's and ask who's filling the motherfucking waffles? Huh? No, no, no, you don't. So why does it matter who made the damn potatoe salad? - It don't really matter. - Exactly my point. Now, scoop some up on your punk-ass plate and shut the fuck up. Now! - Scooping. Scooping. - Scoop it, nigga. - Scoop, nigga. - Eat it all, look at him. - Scoop right here. - There you go. - He didn't mean it, Mookie. - Another scoop. That's two scoops. You know he didn't mean it. There's nothing wrong with your potatoe salad. Yeah. Your potatoe salad is dry. - Yeah, it like the desert. - That's right. It is not dry. I just didn't have enough mayonnaise last year. That's right. What about the year before last? All right. All right, dear. I mean, what about that nasty ham that Grandma makes? What? - I thought it was good. - Shut up. - Shut your ass up. - Shut up. You about to get your ass whipped, boy. Since we're speaking of nasty, what about this nasty-ass raw turkey we be eating every year? - You better watch your damn mouth. - That's turkey? You know what, son of a bitch? I'm gonna tell you one goddamn thing. I didn't want you at this goddamn Thanksgiving dinner. Yeah, this turkey is good. This is a good goddamn turkey. It ain't nothing wrong with this turkey. The turkey is just rare. Rare, my ass. The turkey is raw. - It's raw every goddamn year. - Fuck you. Last year, you cooked up the damn plastic bag with the giblets still inside the goddamn turkey. And the plastic bag was raw. You say another fucking word, I'll carve that hat right off your goddamn head. - The shit is raw and bad. - You raw, motherfucker. Your ass is raw. That's why I have to drink this messed-up punch, to wash the shit down. You said you liked my punch, Papa. They gonna be cracking in here the way I like it. - No, I ain't taking no ass-whooping. - What the fuck you gonna do? Take the goddamn carver and just carve his black ass up. Ray Ray, rip his ass. That ain't your son, no way. That ain't... Get him, Grandpa! Let him have it, Grandpa! Bring your bags. I'm getting out of this ragged motherfucker as soon as I can. Never forgiving that fool. I don't need it... Come on, get the hell out. I don't give a goddamn. If we wanted to be treated like this, we could have gone to the local shelter, and had dinner with the homeless and the underprivileged. Well, you know what, you son of a bitch? Next time you can do that shit. Stop it, Jake. I don't like your goddamn father, he don't like me. That ain't the point. These are my parents. Mama, Daddy, please stay. I'm sorry. What's she sorry about? She is sorry because she allowed her family to be so rude to her mother and her father. Who's her mother and father? Do we know them? - Jesus Christ, she's crazy... - Mama. Stop it. Come on, baby, let's get the hell on out of here. That'll be a good goddamn idea. - Come on, Daddy. - We'll see you again. All right. We'll have you back for Christmas. Where we gonna have Thanksgiving dinner? - Mama. - Come on, Mama. - Come back Christmas, Mama. - Okay. - Take your ragged-ass hat with you. - Oh, stop! - Take that shit... - Jake. I'm tired of it. It took me three damn days to make that damn potatoe salad. You would think for once I wouldn't have to hear, "Who made the potatoe salad?" - It was good. It was good. - I know. Y'all, I'm sorry I acted the way I did, but your albino-possessed-ass daddy - can French kiss my ass. - I'm with you. I'm with you. Hey, Ray Ray, you be good. Holler back at me now. Well, there goes Thanksgiving. I told you when I seen that little boy, the little motherfucker was going to be trouble. It wasn't his fault, Daddy. Yeah, whatever. God! There's plenty of food left if y'all still hungry. Thanks, Mom. June... You have the right to remain motherfucking silent. Anything the fuck you say, can and will be used against your ass in the streets I'm motherfucking with. - This is all my fault. - No, it's not. Believe it or not, this kind of thing happens all the time. Thanks, but that really doesn't make me feel much better. Well, we're leaving tomorrow. Everything will be fine when we get home. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about making the engagement announcement? - It's gonna have to wait. - Ashley. Look, I'm sorry, but... Sorry, we'll just have to talk about it on the train tomorrow, okay? Try to get some sleep. Frank, yeah, what's up, man? Yeah, this is Mike. I know I haven't talked to you since the academy, I know. And I missed your wedding and your son's circumcision. Yeah, I know all that, okay, but that's not important. This is important. I need a big favor. All right, baby. - Jake. - Take your shirt off, will you? - Take your shirt off. - No. - Baby, you're sweating my hair. - Come on now. Frank. Frank, is that you? - Is that you? - Yeah. Yeah. You didn't tell me this place was this far in the hood. Man, there's dogs out there. Pit bulls. Look, man, are you sure these people don't have guns? Yeah, they do, but don't worry about that, though. - What? - No, no. Trust me, trust me. How come you didn't wear the brown makeup like I told you? Ain't nobody gonna believe a white guy would try to rob this house. - They didn't have any at the 99 cent store. - Cheap ass. Besides, people'll just think I'm looking for crystal meth. Whatever. Come on. Come on. You're a fool. Come on. - Come on. Help me move this coffee table. - Okay. This is where I'm gonna whoop you at, right here in this area. Sounds good to me. Yeah. All right. Cool. Cool. All right. Let's change positions. - Let's be... 'Cause... - Good idea. Good idea. They'll see me when they come down. They'll see me. - Yeah, good thinking. - All right. - Here we go. - All right. Now we gonna do this just like we used to do at the academy. Nothing different. Stay loose. All right. You ready? All right, ready? Go. Santa Claus? - Who's that, baby? - I don't know. Come up in this motherfucker? I don't think so. Good. Right where I left it. Come on! Go to sleep. Go to sleep. I got this. I got this. I got this. Teach you to fuck with the Jenkins, motherfucker. Michael. How could you do this? I thought we were friends. Oh, God. I have no idea how he knew my name. Really? Wait. Wait a minute. Do you know him, Michael? No. Well, kind of. What the fuck do you mean, "Kind of," young blood? Yeah, what do you mean, Michael? Michael, please tell me you didn't have anything to do with this. Hell, no. Look, I just figured if... I figured if I staged a burglary, and saved the day, your dad would like me. Then we could tell him we're getting married. Married? Hell, no. I would never allow my daughter to marry a motherfucker like you. You put my family in jeopardy with this nonsense you're bringing into my house. Look, sir... Tell the paramedics to come back. They forgot somebody. How could you do this, Michael? Somebody could have got killed. Baby, I just wanted your family to accept me. You said we would be together whether you clicked with my parents or not. I didn't care whether they liked you or not, but now, I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't be together. - No, Ashley, Ashley, don't... - Wait, wait. Wait. Just get your shit and get out. I am truly disappointed. Baby, we're about to hit rush hour traffic. We got to go. Come on. Tell me, Daddy, why did you hate Michael so much? - 'Cause the boy's a pig, Ashley. - I mean, other than that. What was so wrong with him? He's a punk. The boy is soft. I can't believe you can't see that. - Is that it? - Yeah, I mean, what else is there? Me being happy. And that makes you happy? Staged robberies in my house makes you happy? No. Me being with Michael makes me happy. I love everything about him. His laugh, his personality, everything. But he's a pig, Ashley. And you know how I feel about... Daddy, it's not the '60s anymore. God! Decent black men, proud black men can be police officers. Well, I don't know anything about that, Ashley, okay? Isn't civil rights and equal opportunity what you guys were fighting for in the first place? Yeah. Yeah, well, I'll say Michael is a shining example of just that. A proud black man who wants to marry a black woman, who just happens to be a police officer. Daddy, if that's not an example of freedom, then I don't know what is. Ashley, baby, we gotta go. We're running out of time. Let's go. Hey, Mike. Hey, man, I'm sorry to hear about you and Ashley, you know. It's all right. So, she is single now. Sorry, tough break. Mike, you know how we do? Take it one day at a time. You know what I'm saying? Keep your head up... Yeah, you know, I got divorced a couple of years ago. - Dude, it was rough. - Really? Yeah, but they say the fourth one's the toughest. You're just on your first, you know... Keep your head up, dude. Fight the power. Mike, let me get him out of here. Listen, take care of yourself, talk to me, give me a call, whatever. You're good. I appreciate that. - Cool? - Yeah. - You're sure? - You're good. - Let's go. - She looks great. Come on, White. Damn. Hey, young blood. How you doing? What are you doing here? I thought you hated me. Is there somewhere that we can talk in private around here? Yeah, yeah. You know, we could... Right here. Have a seat, son. Now, I came down here to rap with you for a second, 'cause I didn't like what went down back at the house. - Listen, Mr. Jenkins, I didn't... - Let me finish, son. Let me finish. Now, to say that me and the pigs... I mean, law enforcement, have an unstable history is an understatement. Not only was there the alleged attempted murder of a police officer, but it's the fact that the pigs... I'm sorry, the cops, along with the Federal Government, plotted to take my party down. They infiltrated my organization and caused dissension among the ranks, turning a lot of us into snitches, dope fiends, pimps and hoodlums. They would have you to believe that my party was a gang. We wasn't no gang. We had all kinds of beautiful programs for the people in the community. We had after-school programs, we had free breakfast for the kids, we registered our people to vote. All we were trying to do was protect our community. Thanks. And my feeling for police officers runs real deep. But I came here to tell you that my feelings for my daughter run even deeper. I see the way that she loves you and I don't want to lose my baby girl. So I came here to tell you that I would be happy to have you as a son-in-law. As long as you don't stage no more fake robberies in my goddamn house. No more "Keystone Kop," "Shaft" shit, you know? All right, I won't fuck with you about that no more. I don't have to eat pork, do I? Well, you know, I was always conflicted about the pork issue when I was in the Party. I mean, pork ain't never killed nobody. Okay, no pork. Hey, look, I just want to say I'm sorry for being so hard on you. No, that... No, it's... That's right. That's good enough right there. That's about all I can handle. Now fall back, now. Fall back. - Okay, no. - All right. - Who's in there? - The interrogation room. Hey, Daddy. Why don't you and him do your own little thing? Love conquers all, right? Yeah, baby, yeah. - Chill that metro shit! - Love conquers all. So, there it is. I finally got my wish. Me and Ashley were married in a small, quaint garden in South Central, and we lived happily ever after. That is until Christmas at the Jenkins'. Due to some counseling, a good time and a few cartons of cigarettes, I'm able to correspond with you once again. Now, I just wanted to call and congratulate you on your nuptials. You know, with whatever mock-ass nigga you about to marry. Now, I ain't hating, you know, I'm congratulating. But you know what fucks with me? Is the fact that you'll probably never be able to see that motherfucking slithering cobra. You know how that helmet gets fatter than a motherfucking fat-rat. You know what I'm saying? You'll never be able to see the creepy clingy, the bull's blow, the rat-a-tat-tat. No, but on the real, you know, congratulations on y'all little wedding and shit. You know, I ain't no hating. Congratulating like a motherfucker. There's enough pussy to go around. Pussy everywhere. I know there's about 235 bitches out there right now free to fuck since I'm locked the fuck up. Plus that little half a bitch, that midget, you know what I'm saying? Like to toss her around. But you was my favorite girl. Yeah. Bonaventure. Bonaventure. Hey, on a real, though, that little mock-ass nigga you're with and shit, you know, y'all coming out of that motherfucking church, you know, and they start throwing rice, I hope that shit is rocks, bitch! You know what I'm saying? Fuck you, the priest, your mama, all them motherfuckers sitting there, whoever watching this bitch. All y'all is some punk motherfuckers. Yeah. G-up! Kiss my motherfucking ass, bitch. "You may now kiss the bride," bitch. He kissing my dick, tell that nigga that. What's that nigga's name? Write me back, baby. Write me back. Thinking about you, always.
