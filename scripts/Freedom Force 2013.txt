This is not fiction, it's all real. This is actually happening to me and my new friends. The tall guy there. His name is Aristotle. And of course, she's Nicole. Oh, and that's profiterole and his dog Houston. [ALL SCREAMING] Yeah, so maybe I am screaming my head off. After all, before today I'd much rather just read about adventures than find myself smack in the middle of one. You see, no ones a bigger Sci-Fi fan than me. But even I never imagined I'd be going into some of my favorite stories of all time on a secret mission called "operation freedom force." [THUNDERCLAP] [EVIL LAUGHTER] Master, things are about to go very wrong for that wretched writer Jules Verne. They'll never know. Hmm. I understand. Mm. Yes, of course. Here's to us and all those who are left. [CHUCKLES] Hmm. [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] [COUGHING] Oh! Oh. Ugh. [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] Ooh! Go away! Bad moth. [WOMAN] When we got married, you promised me I would be the new queen. I meant it as a term of endearment. France has not had a queen since Marie Antoinette. This is starting to give me a headache! Imagine how Marie Antoinette must have felt at the end. Ugh! Well, I guess you just don't love me anymore now that you're so busy being the president. Of course I do! What if I put you in charge of something really important? I'm listening. You'll run international literacy day. We're honoring Jules Verne. Frances most famous author. Hmm. Will there be press? Yes, a lot. A film contract? Uh, most likely, yes. Paparazzi? Magazine covers? I can see the headlines now. "Jules Verne. "The father of science fiction, honored by Carol. Frances very own queen of reading." So I will be queen. Still think I don't love you. Snookie Wookie? Oh, Jacques. My Tushie Whooshie. Hey! Let's hold the event at the Louvre and get rid of that ugly glass pyramid that's in front of it. That could be a possibility. We would have to consult the, uh... oh! You are magnificent, my darling husband. And that is why I adore you. Mwah. And with a little luck. I will be on the cover of all the magazines next week! Ciao ciao, now. Ugh! Where's my champagne? With all of his most famous stories mixed up. Jules Verne will be disgraced. [EVIL LAUGHTER] Let's see if "five weeks in a balloon" makes sense without its main character. [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] Oh, no! Lions! Hurry up. [GROWLS] Get us higher. [TOGETHER] Whoa! [GASPS] Dr. Ferguson! Dr. Ferguson... not right now, Joe. But doctor, this journey, it is costing you an arm and a leg. Tell me about it. I mean it quite literally, sir. You are missing an arm and a leg. Oh, Ferguson. You're disappearing! Look! Impossible! And also very inconvenient right now. [ALL GASPING] This is very weird. I knew from the start this was a perfectly terrible idea. Crossing Africa in a hot-air balloon. It's about as insane as someone trying to travel around the world in 80 days. [TOGETHER] Whoa! If you're a religious man, Joe. Now's the time to pray. [JOE] Oh, dear. Next on my hit list. "20,000 leagues under the sea." [EVIL LAUGH] Talk to me, Aronnax. What say the nautilus' sensors? [ARONNAX] Captain Nemo, something is happening to the submarine. Our controls are... [RADIO STATIC] [NEMO] Ugh! Nautilus, come in! Nautilus! [MAN] What's up with the fish? They're afraid of something. [NEMO] Nautilus, do you read me? Come in, nautilus. We've lost contact with the submarine. Wait, I see something. Watch out! It's behind you! [GASPS] Stay back, I'll handle this. [GRUNTS] [MAN] No, captain Nemo! It's suicide! What have you done with my ship, monster? I am the Aveng... wait, let's talk about this. Aah! [MAN] Divers, prepare to attack. On my count. Three... two... one. Go! [MAN #2] It's useless. The creature is too big. [MAN #1] Fall back, men! Fall back! [GRUNTS] [ROARS] All right, you slimy beast. [LAUGHS] I've got you right where I want you. This is for the nautilus! Aah! How about I mess things up from the earth to the moon! [EVIL LAUGH] Gentlemen, good news. After much research. We have finally come to the unmistakable conclusion that we Americans now have the ability. For the first time. To assemble a kind of giant bullet which will carry a crew of humans inside of it, and will actually be able to make the journey to the... [GASPS] Who are you? Gentlemen, please forgive my dropping in unannounced. I am Nemo. Captain and inventor of the underwater vessel the nautilus. Are you a member of our gun club? Have you paid your dues? I know not of what you speak. This is an outrage! You cannot be here, this meeting is exclusively for members only. Not only that. We're in the process of changing history here. And you dare to interrupt? How despicable! Believe me, I did not arrive here on my own volition. But do tell, by chance have you seen a giant octopus? And finally, I'll mix in plots and characters and finally, I'll mix in plots and characters from Verne's own imagination that he never even finished. His stories will be complete gibberish and utter nonsense. Incomprehensible! [LAUGHS SNORTS] Pick up the pace. Normalverbraucher. The flying train has arrived and you're going to make us miss it! Ah. Are you sure the inspector has not tracked us here? I can't be concerned with him now. We must get the suitcase to the volcano before the eclipse. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] Normalverbraucher? Normalverbraucher! Where are you? Where did you go? We're not going to make the train, Normalverbraucher! Normalverbraucher! Normalverbraucher! [PASCAL] Who the heck is Normalverbraucher? This is all wrong! Nemo is missing. There's no one flying the balloon. And the nautilus is gone! Oh la la! All of Jules Verne's stories have gone completely cockamamie cuckoo. Monsieur minister. This is a calamity! An absolute calamity! Ugh, Pascal, what could it possibly be this time? [GASPS] There's no submarine? What happened to all of these stories?!! Ah, what a disaster. What are we going to do now? Je ne sais pas. Ooh la la. Oh la la la la la. I'll have to advise the president that he needs to cancel the Jules Verne event, and then you and I must go to see the Professor. Oh, no no no no no. Oui oui. Oh, no. Oh, oui. Please, no. Oui! What? Absolutely not. Don't you realize how important the Jules Verne event is? Chateau, you're fired if you don't get this mess straightened out! [CELL PHONE RINGS] [CAROL] Hello. Hi, lovey. Hi. How is my snuggly. Wuggly pookie bear? Sweetie, about my big event yes? I need a bigger budget... Well... more money to make it more spectacular, let's not forget about all my wardrobe changes as well! Just hold on a second, honey. And I was thinking about going down... Chateau, you better fix this mess, or else. [PASCAL] But, minister Chateau, please. With all due respect. Je ne sais pas if it is a good idea for us to go and ask the Professor for his help! Pascal, there's no one who knows more about science fiction than he does. Oui! But, the Professor is also totally crazy! Completement fou! Oh, please. Who isn't crazy these days? Last time I saw him. He got angry and tried to transform me into a dog! It was an absolute nightmare! You made him angry? He's already a mad scientist. Don't make him madder! Now you tell me. Anyway, he doesn't understand the difference between science and science-fiction. He's completely nuts! Yes, that's true. I guess you could say he's a little unbalanced. But he is a genius and probably the only one who can figure this out. Even to this day, I still bark whenever I see a squirrel. And forget about what I do when I'm near a fire hydrant. I know precisely what happened! Someone has found the Imaginasium and used it to sabotage these stories. I invented it years ago. But the government shut the project down. As you can see. It really works. Woo-hoo-hoo! Imagination is a force that never dies. It's possible to manipulate someone else's figments. With the Imaginasium. You can do it! Hm, so what is your suggestion, Professor? Do you really think it might be possible to put the stories back into their original state? Well, I might have a solution, but first I need Pascal's help with an experiment I've been working on. I knew this was going to happen. And you can forget it! No! [STRUGGLING SOUNDS] I'm shocked that the electricity in his body is not flowing to the light bulb on his head. Yeah, that is unusual. Maybe there's not enough current? In regards to your problem, Chateau. Something sparked an idea! Could it be the smell of my burning flesh that sparked it!?! J'ai mal la tete. Please, Pascal! Do not interrupt the Professor. [STRUGGLING SOUNDS] We have only 48 hours to reverse the changes to the figments of Jules Verne's imagination. Or else they'll be permanently etched into history that way. Drastic times call for drastic measures. So I propose sending someone inside. And then what? You see, Jules Verne was way ahead of his time. He secretly hid in each of his stories one of his most incredible inventions. This amazing advancement is a breakthrough of truly revolutionary technology! Don't tell me don't tell me! Okay, I know. I'm going to guess that he invented the Internet! No. Was it the nose-hair trimmer? No. [CHATEAU] I can't feel my legs. Chicken nuggets? No! I give up. Shutting down and starting up again. [STRUGGLING SOUNDS] Oh. See? Jules Verne invented the reset button! Shut down and start up. Oh, yeah, I see! And how exactly does this help us? It's simple! All you have to do is go inside. Somewhere in each story is a hidden restart button that you push. And back it goes! So the stories will reset to their normal form. And the problem is solved! Exactly! [PASCAL] Aah! But a crucial mission like this requires that you put together a most exceptional team. [ALPHA LEADER] Alpha squad, we are on standby for operation freedom force. Do not engage targets until final orders from the president himself [COPILOT] Understood. All units stand by. Yes, I know it sounds unbelievable. Monsieur president. But it's our only hope. Okay, now that has got to be the craziest thing I've ever heard in my whole life. Which is saying a lot since I do work in politics. I have to admit it does sound farfetched. Alright, I have one word for you guys... reset button. I'm pretty sure that's two words. Whatever, semantics! Point is. In very much the same way you might reboot a computer. Or restart a video game from the beginning. We can reset all the stories to the way they were. And just how will you get inside the stories, huh? With a little something I have found called "the Imaginasium!" The Imaginasium. It's one-of-a-kind. And, despite Vaneelo's doubts, I am sure it actually works. Our technicians are fine-tuning it as we speak. [THINKING] I'm going to have to do something about this. Hm I have a special-ops force in the air right now awaiting your go-ahead to procure the elite team we need to execute my brilliant plan that I guarantee will save the day! Sounds impossible. Well our scientists in the agency of impossible affairs didn't seem to think so. As a matter of fact. They have already altered another literary classic! [LAUGHS] There's room at the asylum you know. I know. [LAUGHS] I sometimes love my job too much. Especially when I can present to you the imagination of William Shakespeare. Using the Imaginasium we have altered, slightly, a couple of his creations. So very subtly, so that even the most die-hard fans of Shakespeare will not complain. No, no, no, no, I guarantee you that! Please, see for yourself. "TV or not TV. That is the question." Chateau, this is amazing! [CHUCKLES] Thanks. So, today every single edition of "Hamlet" in every single part of the world now has the line changed. "To be or not to be" is history!! It really says that in all the Hamlet books in the world? Yes, that's what I'm telling you! Of course, we have 48 hours to reverse it. I mean we're not completely off! We'll use the very same technology to restore Jules Verne's stories to the way they were. For the first time today I have some hope that my marriage is going to be saved after all, and I won't have to sleep in the limo. Oh, it's good for the country and all that, don't get me wrong. But after all, a happy wife is a happy life! Chateau, you'll be awarded the legion of honor if you manage to pull this off before my wife's event. But if you fail, then it's straight to the guillotine. [GASPS] Another brilliant French invention! So is it safe to say you are approving the plan? Operation freedom force is a full go! [MAN] Alpha Squad, this is Eiffel nine. [MAN] Alpha Squad, this is Eiffel Nine. You have clearance to proceed. Over. Copy that uh, sir, what exactly is operation freedom force, sir? That code name is designed to hide the true nature of the mission... even from us. Roger that this is as top secret as it gets, major. Good luck. [GASPS] [BOY] Look who it is! Mr. Bookworm himself and just guess what he's doing. Reading a book for a change! Yeah. He thinks he's so smart. As if reading makes you smart! I've never read a book in my life, and look at me! If he wants to learn so badly, I'll be happy to teach him a lesson! And it'll be a lesson he'll never forget! [EVIL CHUCKLING] Uh oh! Time to hit the road! Mon chocolate goes right to my hips. [SHOUTS] Maniacs! You can't run from us. Aah! [LAUGHTER] Ha ha! We got you now. You little Bookworm. Huh, why don't you get off your knees and take it like a man. No, please! Pick on someone your own size! [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Huh? [GASPS] Bullying is not cool. Let's see. If I route the primary source file through a binary output modifier. And compile it without parsing the static variables. Then my matrix extensions should replicate in the closed loop system through the proxy server. Ha! Oh, yeah. [SHOUTING] [MECHANICAL WHIRRING] Whoa! Ugh! [MAN] Raid two, this is Alpha control. Report in. What is happening down there? Raid two, can you hear me? What is your current position? Sir, my current position is an arabesque. I can't speak for the others, but now I am doing a flying brise into a pirouette with a double plie. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Aristotle Renaud. Step away from the keyboard. Wow! Cool a uh-7o black navajo! Please help. How come nobody wants to be friends with me? I wish I could just figure it out. [FARTS] [DOG WHINES, BARKS] Oh, right. That's why. I can't help it if I'm a little gassy some of the time. Okay, so maybe I'm a lot gassy all the time. Houston, are you all right? [GASPS] Hey! Son, you're coming with... ugh! What is that stench? [GROANS] Oh-ho! We need a biohazard team in here! It's a stink-bomb! The worst smell I've ever smelled my entire life. I want to cut my nose off my face. And my face off my neck. Losing muscle control. Abort the mission. Every... man... For... himself. We are under attack. I repeat. We are under attack. The enemy is silent. But deadly. Can't breathe. Tell mommy I love her. Ugh. [FILTERED BREATHING] A gas mask? Finally! Someone who can be my friend! [MAN ON TV] Take your stance. Ready. Fight! [TECHNO] Hiya! [GRUNTS] Roundhouse. Good. Target spotted. Double roundhouse. Combo move! Bonus score. Perfect! [MAN OVER WALKIE] Alpha six and nine, move in. [SWAT GUY] Copy that. Miss, you're coming with us. Ugh! Ugh! Stand down! I told you to stand down! Tell me who you are! What do you want? Special forces! Top secret mission. Direct orders from the president. Mm. Why didn't you say so? Is everyone ready to go? Oh, no, no, no, no. Not yet. We're still missing Nicole. Ah, here she is now! Welcome! Welcome one and all! You have been specially selected to help make history as part of operation freedom force! This mission is ultra-classified as super quadruple hush-hush extreme... oh! [CLEARS THROAT] Uh, please excuse the little outburst of our subordinate. That is my assistant Pascal. Now, as you know, one of our greatest national heroes is the man they call the father of science fiction, the writer Jules Verne. But just yesterday, we discovered a tragic situation and a most perplexing problem. [GROWLS] It seems that some of his classic stories have become somewhat. Uh, mixed up. That sounds terrible, but how are we supposed to help? I'm glad you asked! Believe it or not. We have an amazing invention. A machine like nothing you've ever seen! With this technology we can insert you kids right into the imagination of Jules Verne! The Imaginasium! The plan is for you to go into the stories. And help us revert them back to their original state. So how come you picked us? Partly because you are all 12 years old, the age at which Verne had just started writing. And the many figments of his creativity were developing. Right! And using the same age wavelengths we can more easily teleport you straight into his imagination. Cool! Wow! The other reason you were all chosen is that each of you represents a side of Jules Verne's personality. That way when we teleport you. We don't have to worry about any of you being rejected. Aristotle, you represent his genius and the love he had for technology. And Peter, we know you've read all his books. You embody Verne's passion for great literature. Huh. Nicole, you represent love. You just happen to be a direct descendent of Jules Verne's first love Caroline Dezaunay. Despite being first cousins, he was crazy in love with her. He was just plain crazy to be in love with his cousin. Yuck! That was very common back then. Huh? She must have been very beautiful. Like you. Huh? I was in love with my cousin once too! I remember that whenever I saw her face my heart filled with joy. She haunts me to this day with her beautiful, bald head and her soft skin. And the way her diaper filled the room with a smell that... ooh! What about me? What part of Jules Verne do I represent? Ah! My assistant, Pascal, will explain that to you. Oui! I mean, no! No, no. Moi? Oui, oui, my friend. No, no, no, no, uh-uh. Ugh! You are giving me a migraine! Tell him! No, no, no, it's your place. I wouldn't know the right way to say it! Look. Jules Verne had serious gas problems. So you represent that. [FARTS] [ARISTOTLE] Profiterole! Oh, very serious. Now for the fun part. You will soon be teleporting into different stories that take place anywhere from 100 to 150 years ago. You are wearing special electro-synthesizer suits that, with the touch of a button, allow you to change your appearance into the perfect disguise. So no matter in what location or situation you find yourself, no one will suspect a thing. Observe. [SUIT BEEPS] Ha! Wow! Awesome! Cool! [BARKS] [SUIT BEEPS] Ta-da! Whoa! [SUIT BEEPS] Voila! [LAUGHTER] Well, shall I show you some more then, hm? No I think you've shown us enough. Momma always said just because you can wear something doesn't mean you should! Now, it's time for you guys to start practicing with your own suits. So you can get ready for the mission! [CHEERS] [BARKS] Yeah! [GIGGLING] Uh, now don't take this the wrong way. But don't you think that's maybe a little bit too much? So you mean you don't like what I'm wearing? Uh no, no, no, no! I think you look beautiful dressed like that. I was referring to... yes, of course. You're probably right. I am a little overdressed. I'll have to show them more skin! If that bikini gets any smaller. I'm not sure if my approval ratings are going to go up or down. [CAROL] Yoo-hoo! Wardrobe. [COMPUTER ALERT] Diagnostics program complete. [TOGETHER] Whoa! Restoring services. Awesome! Yay! Yes! All systems online. The time has come! I present to you the Imaginasium. The gateway to imagination! It's even cooler than I thought. Incredible. Revolutionary! Look at that technology! Wait until I blog about this! Actually. Operation freedom force is classified top-secret. And even we can't tell anyone about it. Your roles in this affair must remain off-the-record until I publish my autobiography "the genius of Chateau!" I can't believe it's really happening!! This is awesome! We're actually going into the imagination of Jules Verne! It won't be dangerous, right? [EXPLOSION] Aah! Aye! [CLEARS THROAT] It's an extremely safe machine that has passed almost all of the most strictest of security tests. There's nothing to worry about. Really. It's a silly formality. But I will need you to review this accident release form and then sign here. As tall as you are torpedo. Tell me one thing. Why is everything over your head? Don't answer that. It's rhetorical. I'm putting a virus into the Imaginasium to try to shut it down. But if that doesn't work. Then you will go into the stories to stop those kids. [GRUNTS] But boss. How am I gonna be able to get into Julie Verner's imagination? I'm pretty sure that I don't represent any part of his personality, and I sure ain't 12 years old. [SIGHS] Your brain stopped working when you were 12, so that's why this will work. Oh yeah! I knew you'd know. You're a genius! Well, some would say genius. I prefer mastermind. [EVIL LAUGH] [CHOKING] [SIZZLES] Oh, nothing to worry about. Just a simple controlled test of our system of fuses. Testing the extinguisher now. Testing, testing... good! [SIGHS] Ha! So, everything seems to be in order. Which story is gonna be first? You won't believe it. You're going into "from the earth to the moon." Oh yeah! I've always wanted to fly in a rocket. I read this book. They build a giant Cannon to launch the spaceship. Like a cannonball? Wow! And as I recall. You don't know what happens because it ends in a cliffhanger. I know what happens. You kids will push the restart button to reboot the story. And then you will be teleported into the next adventure. How will we find the restart buttons? Ah, yes. That is Avery good question, Nicole, but a small detail. We are hoping that once you are inside the story. Our guidance system will get you very close. Doesn't sound like much of a plan, does it Houston? [LAUGHS] No need to worry at all. We will be watching your every move on our screens. And you will be able to hear us in your ears the entire time. Okay, so launch us already. Wow. Get set to go! [COMPUTER ALERT] Launch sequence initiated. Porting power to zypher drives. Accessing Jules Verne database. Figment algorithms calculated. Mapping transport coordinates. Hey! What's going on? Relax, everything is proceeding just as planned! [COMPUTER ALERT] Warning. Are you sure? System anomaly virus detected. Abort override initiated. Access violation. I really don't like the looks of this. Whoa. This is weird. Aah! Control procedures compromised. And I definitely don't like this! Stay calm everybody. I think this is something that is supposed to happen. Don't worry about a thing. We're right on schedule. I'm not worried about a thing so you shouldn't worry either. Just relax, and breathe, breathe, breathe, br... alert failure in secondary teleport protocol. [SCREAMING CONTINUES] Pascal, the kids are in danger! We need to shut this down right now! Warning. Excess energy buildup. System overload imminent. Power capacity reached. Help, get me out of here! It's gone out of control! System failure in 20 seconds. Whoa! System failure in 15 seconds. System failure... I'm going to override the software. It's your only hope! Nine, eight, seven, six, five... [ALL SCREAMING] [GROANING] Hey! Watch where you're touching! Get your hands off me! Sorry about that, Nicole. It was an accident. My eyes are still adjusting to the dark. This looks like it's some sort of spaceship. It actually worked. We're really inside the story! So what happens now? According to the book. The Cannon blasts the ship off using gunpowder. [GASPS] [MAN] There's someone in the projectile. Those guys are all from different stories! Hurry! Let's close the porthole so they can't get in! Who are these intruders? They look like they're from another planet. [PETER] Better getaway. It's about to take off! [ENGINES STARTING] Run! [SCREAMING] I hope the restart button is somewhere in here. [PASCAL OVER INTERCOM] [CLEARS THROAT] Is this thing on? Can you hear me? Welcome aboard to the on-time departure of our inaugural flight of Pascal airlines with non-stop service to the moon! Stop joking around, Pascal, we have a mission to complete! Yes, about that I have some good news and bad news. You see, the restart button is very close by. That's the good news... And, its also the bad news, I'm afraid. What do you mean? What I'm saying is that the restart button is on the rocket the outside of the rocket huh? Ha! Ah. Why didn't you tell us that when we were back on earth, Pascal? Ah, excuse moi, but I was a little busy myself getting rid of the software virus that overloaded the system and almost destroyed everything. I thought the Imaginasium was a safe and completely tested machine. We said it was safe. We never said it was completely tested. Temperature outside is negative 292! Whoever can stand the cold best should go. That'd probably be the person who's very athletic. Someone not very chubby- profiterole, you're carrying more layers than the rest of us. You're the best candidate. Houston, we have a problem. [GASPS] [ARISTOTLE OVER WALKIE] Profiterole, hang on. It looks like we're entering an asteroid field. [SHOUTING] Think I'm ready to go home now, please! Aah! It's too dangerous. I'm going out to help him. I'll go with you! [SHOUTS] [GRUNTS] The hatch is broken. [GASPS] Profiterole has fallen off! Help! Oh no, don't leave me! Wait! Oh, please, help! We have to save profiterole! We're comin' back for you! Please don't go! More power! Here! Hang in there, profiterole! Closer! [PASCAL] You are losing power! We're completely out of gas. [PROFITEROLE] What do you mean. You're out of gas? No! [GASPS] No! I don't believe this. You can do it. Come on profiterole. Keep going! Stay strong. [BARKS] I'm never out of gas! [FARTS] [GASPS] Ugh. [FARTS] [CHEERS] Hey you guys. I don't see the button anywhere. It must be there! Don't you see anything out there that reads "reset?" No, but there's something here that reads "adventure star tours." Yeah, "adventure star tours!" Hm. Ah... Aah! We're being pulled into a giant asteroid. We're going to crash! [SCREAMS] Listen up, everyone. I figured it out. Profiterole, find the letter "r" in "adventure." It's the beginning of the word "restart!" And, then along with "star" and the "t" in "tours," it spells out "restart!" I see it! Now push the button! Hurry! Get ready! I pushed the button, but nothing happened! [GASPS] This is getting too close! Whoa! Now we're in the story "five weeks in a balloon!" Now how did they get here? Where is the doctor? We'll explain if you keep us from crashing into that rock. [SCREAMING] Let me steer! I have a video game just like this! [JOE] Looks like we've got company! [GASPS] [GROWLS] [NICOLE] Why are those lions chasing us? [PETER] I don't know. This doesn't happen in the real story. Must be part of the mix-up. [GASPS] [GROWLS] [NICOLE] Whoa! Hey! I thought you said you had a video game like this! [ARISTOTLE] Yeah, but I didn't say I was good at it! [SCREAMING] [BARKING] [PROFITEROLE] Houston, no! Hiya! I got you. Aah! Brace yourselves! [PETER] Can't you get this thing any higher? [KENNEDY] Yes. We're way too low. We should find something to cut loose! [PROFITEROLE] Did I hear someone say, "cut loose?" Well then I'm your man! [FARTS] Take that! [ARISTOTLE] The lions are throwing us off balance! [PETER] We're spinning out of control. [NICOLE] Hang on, everyone. [JOE] We are almost touching ground! [GASPS] Those lions are relentless. We have got to gain altitude! It's now or never! I'm trying. But the wheel is stuck! [PROFITEROLE] Why couldn't Jules Verne just imagine soft, cuddly pussy cats instead? [NICOLE] We were almost their dinner. [PETER] We can help bring doctor Ferguson back, I promise. Please trust us and lower your weapons so we can all work together. You had better be telling us the truth! Where do you want us to take you? [PASCAL OVER EARPIECE] To the temple of Onoffon. He's sayin' we should go to the temple of Onoffon. In the village of the Munchi Munchi tribe. [LAUGHS] The Munchi Munchi! That's the name of the tribe that we're supposed to go see. Why do you think they call themselves that? It's an onomatopoeia. Oh, so they're Japanese! No, it means the word and the sound are the same. Like the buzz of a bee, or the tick-took of a clock. So like the word burp. [CHUCKLES] Check it. [BURPS] Profiterole! "Munchi Munchi" is the sound this tribe makes while they're eating. Which means that there's Avery good chance that they're cannibals. That's cool. Everyone has the right to be what they wanna be when they grow up, right? Cannibalism is not a profession. Unfortunately it means they eat people, like us! They eat their enemies. Profiterole. You might be the main course on the Munchi-Munchi's menu. Knock it off. There's an equal chance that the Munchi-Munchi are vegetarians. Don't be so sure! If they are cannibals. They will likely go after the one of us who is most meaty and tender. [FARTS] Profiterole! [JOE] Oh, for the love of Vishnu! Excuse me. I think I'm gonna be sick. Blech! That's bloody awful! Ugh. I do finally believe that the four of you are indeed from another realm entirely. There's nothing in our world that stinks like that! Ooh. Profiterole, drop the anchor onto something soft. [ELEPHANT TRUMPETS] Uh oh. Well, it was something soft anyway. Steady. You're all mine. No! Elephants are an endangered species! Are you out of your mind? If we don't stop this beast. It's going to cause us to crash! But we caused this situation, not him. You have no right to shoot down an innocent animal. Gotta do something, Nicole! If this balloon bursts. We won't make it to the temple of Onoffon! Ok! I'm going down. Using a gun is never a good way to solve a problem. Nicole! Nicole, why are you all the way over here? I... I wanted to be alone. Oh, I'm sorry. You were really brave back there. The elephant needed me. Nowadays we get so wrapped up in our own problems that we forget to take care of each other. Guess what. Not everyone forgets! You are really so sweet. I mean the fruit is sweet. I mean the gesture is... [NERVOUS LAUGHTER] Your gesture is so sweet, Peter. I really like talking to you, Nicole. I really like talking to you too. Hmm. Torpedo, find an observation site. Go look for the lair of some animal. When they're asleep, destroy their balloon, and that will be the end of their expedition! Okay boss, I can do that. But I got one question. Just, what the heck is a lair? Oh, you big brainless fool! Go find a hole, an orifice. A burrow, whatever! Hey Aristotle. You gotta eat something. This shish kabob stuff is the greatest thing ever! Not right now. I'm mapping out our route for tomorrow. Well your loss is my gain. And boy do I mean gain! I could chow down on this all night long. 'Cause it's the perfect blend of sweet and salty and tangy and spicy. [GULPS] It's got all the flavors I love. Hey Joe, what do you call this delicious thing you made? It's so good! It's an old family recipe. Worms on a stick. [GULPS] Did you say worms? Yes, and I add my secret blend of spiders, ants, and insects to make it finger-licking good. How could you possibly do something like that to me? You know I have a nervous stomach. And an irritable colon. And chronic diarrhea. Part-time constipation. An inflated esophagus. And ridiculous gas! Better hide in my lair. You can't serve me worms. It compromises my entire system. That's why I'm in this story! [LOUD DEFECATION] Aah! Oh no, not again! Aah! [LOUD DEFECATION] [ELEPHANT TRUMPETS] [SIGHS] Oh! [SIGHS] [GIGGLES] [HOOFS TRAMPLING] [HORSE WHINNIES] [GRUNTING] Oh! What was that? Ah, marauders! Gotta get a move on Ellie. Faster! We have to catch up with Nicole and get her back into the balloon. Yes, but that's easier said than done. This balloon is much too heavy. We'll never get enough speed to catch her before they do. Charge! Yah! Lets get them! We've gotta do something! They're getting closer! Come on, help me lighten up our load! Hyah-ah-oh! Smarts! [GRUNTS, SIGHS] Hey! And yah! Yah. And what about this clock? Now you won't be late! They are still coming, and we have nothing left to throw. [BARKS] Houston! Wha... oh, hey! Flying dog! Ooh... wha? How? [CHATTERING IN FRUSTRATION] [BARKING, GROWLING] Huh! Go on without me! That way you'll be lighter! I'll just convert my suit into a flying one! Profiterole! Stop, don't jump! These suits aren't able to fly! Now you tell me! Uh... hee... [GIGGLES] Aah. [MEN CHATTERING] [HORSES WHINNYING] Nicole! Peter? Give me your hands. Hurry! Ehh! [GROANING] [SIGHS] [ALSO SIGHS] We've got to go on with the mission. That almost gave a heart attack! I knew they'd get through that okay. But me, in my case. I'm not so sure. Poor profiterole. Do you think he's okay? He'll be all right. I've got to hand it to him, he's one tough. Brave little guy. Pascal? Pascal! Can you see profiterole? [PASCAL] We only have one camera. It's true. Parliament would only approve ze budget that allows us the one camera. Politicians. Of course. There is only one way for you to help profiterole. You must hit restart in this story, and then join up with him in the next one. Well, it looks like we are on the right route. There's the Dezmontoza river. I saw that on my map. In the tree of giant snakes! [WHIMPERING, SIGHING] [NATIVES CHANTING, DRUMMING] So, what about the Munchi-Munchi? I've got an idea. When the moon goes behind the clouds. We'll descend from above and make the Munchi-Munchi believe that we are lunar gods. Who must enter the temple of Onoffon. In order to make the moon reappear. You just came up with that? I read a lot. So I have a pretty active imagination. Munchi Munchi. I sure hope you can't understand me. "Ring around the rosey. Pocket full of posies. "Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar? Onoffon, Onoffon, Onoffon!" What do you know? It actually worked! Once we enter the temple, that's hopefully when Dr. Ferguson will return. So you two should wait in the balloon. But if the moon reappears. You'd better be on your way. [JOE] What about you? It was nice to meet you. But it's time for us to go. [NATIVES MUTTERING] [JOE] Either those three are incredibly courageous. Or they're completely crazy! [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] [ROARING, LAUGHING] Torpedo, they're entering the temple. Go finish them off! [CHATEAU] Who is that muscle-bound maniac? [PASCAL] He's definitely not part of the story, that's for sure. I don't get it! How do they enter the imagination? I'm getting a lot on him. Intruder, I've got you now! Aah! What is that octopus doing here? From the looks of things, whatever he wants! This is all wrong! You have to send it back! [SCREAMS] Oh, no! We have got to get out of here, now! Hurry, quick! [SCREAMS] [COMPUTER] Total system failure. All services offline. Good-bye. This is a disaster! [SOBBING] It's okay, boss. Right now, the most important thing we can do is to focus on the positive side of all of this! Here are the facts, Pascal. We have lost the children. And without the Imaginasium, they can never return! And, I'm going to lose my job tomorrow, after the president's wife is humiliated, because we couldn't fix Jules Verne's stories! And now, there's a giant octopus running amok! [GROWLS] Tell me, Pascal. What is the positive side of all this? You have to calm down. Let me see. Missing children. Furious first lady. Crazy stories. Octopus... of course... aha! I know the positive side. Do you realize that the price for fresh. Sushi-grade octopus is over 12 Euros per pound? And our octopus has got to be at least 35,000 pounds. That's over 400,000 Euros! Assuming the euro doesn't collapse before we sell the entire carcass... but just in case, maybe we sell it to the Japanese and insist on getting paid in yen! [FATIGUED CHEERS] [MUTTERING] [ARISTOTLE] Peter, you realize if the moon breaks through the clouds, we're dead meat. Did you have to say "meat"? Look at that inscription. "On," "off," "on." Onoffon! Duh! It's so obvious now. Jules Verne was pointing us to the restart button the whole time... there you are. Uhh... Aah! Aah! Go, Nicole! [GROANS] You can do it! Aw! [GROWLS] Huh? Nothing's happening! On, off, on. That's it! Pull the lever down again! Look. Look! [MUNCHI MUNCHI MUMBLING] [WARRIORS GRUMBLING] Oh! [CHATTERING] [TARZAN YELL] Nobody messes with the friends of the great profit... aah... ungh. Aah! [MENACING GROWLS] Guys, do you feel that? The restart button. It must have a delay mechanism in it before it activates! It's the portal! We're saved! [BABBLING] Why is it taking so long to teleport? The other parts of the story must be resetting first. [TALKING LOUDLY IN NATIVE LANGUAGE] Aah! Get ready to go! Come on, Houston! Hang on tight, Nicole. We'll get through this. No! Where do you think you're going? Come back here! Come back! I'll get you... uh! [ANXIOUS YELLING] Na, na... [ROARS] [SCREAMS] Why? Why? S'il vous plait, boss. Please don't make me go! Ze Professor. He is a sadistic lunatic. And I have half a mind to drive us right over this cliff rather than spend another minute with him! I agree. You have only half a mind. What? Come on! You still can't be mad at me about the octopus. It was your fault, after all, moi? Because I've warned you before that that stinky cologne you wear causes my eyes to tear... which is probably the reason why I hit the wrong button! So there! Well, if there's a solution to this catastrophe, the Professor will know it. Hey-y! You're just in time. I need your help with a dilemma. Which of these two items came first? Was it the cork. Or the corkscrew? Corkscrew. Hein? Corks, of course. Hein? It was the cork! Obviously. I disagree, it was the corkscrew! Minister Chateau, please! Why would someone need to invent a corkscrew if there were no corks that needed to be pulled from the bottle? And why would someone plug up a bottle with a cork. If there was no corkscrew to open it with! [SQUEAKS] The cork! The corkscrew! The cork! The corkscrew! The most perplexing puzzle. And it's even more important than the chicken and the egg conundrum. Because what if the chicken needs a drink in order to lay the egg? Have you seen profiterole or Peter? I can't find them anywhere. I guess they landed on a different side of the boat. I wonder what story this is? Don't know. But if anyone would, it's Peter. Because he's read all of Jules Verne's books. I sure wish he was here right now. Nicole, are you and he... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He's my heart. No! ...By heart. I mean... he really knows these stories by heart. And that's very helpful. My valet, Normalverbraucher, just disappeared! Reliable help is difficult to find. I have to catch the flying train to rendezvous with capt. Nemo and his nautilus submarine. But now, Nemo has vanished! So, we're in a mixed-up version of 20,000 leagues under the sea! But how can the story exist without its main character? Don't know. But that's what we're here to fix with the restart button. You thought you could escape from me? Run! No! [GRUNTS] [PUNCH LANDING, GRUNTING] Ohh! [GASPING] Huh? [SADISTIC CHUCKLING] Yah! Oh! [LAUGHING] [YELLING] [NICOLE SCREAMS] Very interesting. Hmm. Yes, very interesting! So what do you think, Professor? Here's what I think... Very interesting. Yes, we get that! So, do you have a solution to our very interesting problem. Or not? Which problem? Ah, the kids! Ze kids! We have to find away to get the kids back, Professor! Oh! I have so much going on, it's hard to keep track of it all. Now, let's start from the beginning. Was it the cork or the corkscrew? Aah! The kids, Professor. Oh, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I think I have an idea that just might work. [BOTH SIGHING] It was about the time I invented the yell phone... which is like a cell phone, except you have to shout into it. Never really took off. I don't know why! But that has nothing to do with this. Oh! Now, before the Imaginasium. I made a prototype! I'm not sure if it still works. But like I always say, you have to have an open mind. As long as your brains don't fall out. Because that can get very messy. Follow me! [MANIACAL LAUGHING] Ohh! This isn't funny. You crazy freak! Enough is enough! Please, if you've got any shred of humanity. You just have to let us go! Oh, okay. No-o! [TALKING THROUGH BUBBLES] [SMOTHERING] This is awesome! I can't believe we're under water! Whoa! It's the lost city of Atlantis! This must be how Jules Verne imagined it. And, guess what? Whoo-hoo-hoo! With the air pressure down here, I don't feel the least bit gassy. Hmm.Aah! [WHIMPERING] Lucky for us these suits turn invisible. Hey! Do you know where everyone else is? Huh? Aristotle! Nicole! Yeah, that's right. That's exactly who I'm talking about. No! What I'm saying is, they're right behind you! I'm behind them too. One hundred percent. No matter what. I've got their back! Just like you're behind me. And I'm behind you. Sink or swim! Take a look! Aah! [WHIMPERS] Ya know, when I said "sink or swim," I meant it metaphorically. I'm "sharkophobic." It runs in my... those are my friends. We're going in. [TRYING TO BREATHE] [BUBBLING] Mm. Mm. Ahh... Aristotle! Nicole! Hang in there! I hope we're not too late. Activate their diver suits. Okay, guys. Now you can breathe! Profiterole. You take Aristotle, and I'll grab Nicole... Wha'? Peter! It's the shark! Watch out! I'll try to stop it. Ohh... oh! Profiterole! Help me! I'm on my way! Uh... Get away from my friend! [SCREAMS] Why do I have a bad feeling about this? I need to borrow your brain. It's the closest thing that I have to a 12-year-old child. No offense. So tell me, which one of Jules Verne's stories do you want to check first? Je ne sais pas! How am I supposed to know where those kids have gone? I'm a man of science. I need facts and figures. So feed me some data. When we last saw the kids. There were at the temple of Onoffon. Okay, so let's start with 5 weeks in a balloon. Now we're cookin'! [GASPING, MOANING] Is this going to hurt? It shouldn't. I'm at a pretty safe distance. [SCREAMING] Voila! Oh, ho, ho, ho! We're using Pascal's cerebrum as our projector. Fortunately, Pascal's brain is relatively empty. [PROFESSOR] Yes. There's almost zero interference with the signal. Hmm. Nothing! Professor, are you sure this crazy thing is working properly? Sure? The only thing for sure is, I'm 100% positive you can never be absolutely certain! Just switch to another story, okay? Ahh... Normalverbraucher? A flying train? Why would anyone think of using that? It's preposterous! I agree, but since we are able to see this story on the projector, that means the kids must be somewhere later inside. Yeah, yeah. Fast forward, Professor. Voila! We have success. There they all are! I'll slow it down to real time. Please, Nicole. Nicole, please. Talk to me! Wake up, talk to me! Aristotle! Come on, wake up! I know you wouldn't want to miss this amazing underwater city! This is all my fault! I should have swam faster. Nicole! Nicole!! Aristotle? There's a million gadgets here that you'd love. It's amazing! Come on! Snap out of it! [BARKING] Where am I? Where's Nicole? Nicole, Nicole! Come on, you can't give up! She tried to fight him. To save me. There are so many things I have to tell you. Like how you make me feel. Well, you better start talking. 'Cause there's no time like the present. Nicole! I don't believe it! [CHUCKLES] [CHATEAU] Ah, yes. Young love. Vive l'amour. Chateau! We had an also tiny minor technical glitch that took us off-line for a while, but we are once again able to see you. We've got a problem. There's someone else in these stories. He's following us everywhere, and he's trying to stop us. I'm pretty sure our shark friend took care of that situation. Then I suggest you turn your attention back to completing the mission! But because we are not fully functional. You must somehow locate the reset button on your own! Okay. If we separate, we can search that much faster. Not a good idea. I heard an alert earlier. They're out there patrolling for intruders. So now what? You guys should stay here where it seems safe. Nobody knows Jules Verne's imagination as well as I do. I'll find that reset button. Bravest Bookworm I ever met. And he's sweet, too. [GRUNTING] Now this looks promising. There's a whole bunch of buttons. One of 'em's gotta be it. Those darn prunes. I'm gonna have to go again. You know you got no-one to blame but yourself, right? [YAWNS] Since Jules Verne was a visionary, maybe I should be thinking outside the box. Hmm. Control... alt... Delete. That's it! Those are the keys that reboot every modern computer. I just got to push all three... aah! Ughh. Yi! [SNORES] [SCREAMS] No! [SNORES] [GRUNTS] [GROANING] Oh, come on. Get off of me! Got a word of advice for you. I'd recommend you avoid going down to level 5 for a while, if you know what I mean. [CHUCKLES] Oh! Mm. It's an intruder! Ah... huh... Wh-what'd you say? I was just resting my eyes. Keep a watch on it. I'm calling security. He's not goin' nowhere! Yaah! [SHOUTS] Bye! He did it! He found the button! [SCREAMING] [CHILDREN YELL] [STARTLED YELL] Whoa! Whoo-hoo! I couldn't be more proud. Hooray! You're home. [GROWLING] [PEOPLE SCREAMING] All of the stories have gone back to normal. Operation freedom force worked thanks to your bravery and ingenuity. You are all heroes! Real heroes! Hold on. There is still the small matter of the giant octopus that is bearing down on Paris even as we speak. It should hit downtown just as the curtain goes up to celebrate Jules Verne day! It's ironic that a monster from Verne's own imagination is now ruining his name! It's not ironic, it's perfect! Even better than me mixing up that hack's miserable stories. Why that... why, you... so, you are the saboteur? You are putting our brotherhood at risk. How could you expect me to allow this abomination? So, yeah, that's right. It's me! What kind of brotherhood, huh? What's it about? Nice try, but never in a million years would I tell you our precious secrets. Oh, no! Not even under intense torture would I reveal that the grand leader of our brotherhood... Is a famous rap artist whose name sounds exactly like a delicious. Candy-coated chocolate treat. Until the end of my days, I will always protect the secret identity of king Emm... phht! Ha? Who's "king Emp"? Hmm. So what you are saying is you are following the commands of a big rap star who does not like science fiction? No! You could never understand, because you haven't been initiated. This is a conspiracy! They want to have us disappear. Who do they want to have disappear? The leftys! [ALL] The leftys? Yes, yes, yes! All of those geniuses... DaVinci, Napoleon, Chaplin, Beethoven... Seinfeld, Oprah Winfrey, king Em... [STIFLING] All! All of them. Left-handed. All. Can you hold for one minute? This is giving me a headache, and I thought Oprah was a righty. And H.G. Wells, a lefty, is the true father of science fiction. And not Jules Verne. Verne wrote his books before Wells was even born! Whatever! My path became clear when the president called Meinto his office to say Vaneelo, I want you to be my right-hand man. Now can you see the atrocity I have to bear? You are crazy, you know that? Get some help. So I conceived the plan to destroy Jules Verne and Whoo-hoo! Let H.G. Wells take his rightful place. I know a very good doctor. Don't anyone move! I receive direct orders from the king. Yes, master. Yes, master. And now, he's just talking to his hand. He's totally loco! [BARKS] Hey, guess what? I'm left-handed too. Seriously? Well then. You completely understand. A hundred percent, for sure! [NICOLE] We're on the same team. Let's shake on it. Hmm. [SQUEEZES TIGHT] Oh! Hey, cool down! Please, drive faster. We have to get to Paris before it's too late. Assuming the city's still standing! Teleporting the octopus back into the story is our only hope! In addition to my long-standing hopes for world peace. Sushi ice cream and a spice girls' reunion tour. ["LA MARSEILLAISE"] Ladies and gentlemen. This standing ovation for me is really unexpected and humbling. I am honored. But I'm here today to pay tribute to a great writer. Jules Verne. With a song that I wrote just for him. [MELODY FROM "CARMEN'] oh, he was Jules Verne you know his name science fiction's how he made his fame [LE PRESIDENT] Dear? Don't you think it would be wise to maybe save your voice? [SIGHS] Oh, good idea, sweetie. Look! We're here. ["LA MARSEILLAISE" AS DISCO] [PAPARAZZI SHOUTING QUESTIONS] [REPORTER] It's a giant octopus. Mr. president. What is happening? [SCREAMING] Uh, so it appears the animatronic part of our presentation is already under way, and quite realistic! Keep it moving. Keep it moving. This is not a drill. The target is armed and dangerous. Eight arms! Mission control. This is squadron leader. We're at Mach 5. Over Paris airspace in t-1 minute. Oh! There it is! Aah! That is one angry octopus! It's destroying all the billboards with captain Nemo on them! Let's change to our diving suits. Maybe it will chase after us, and we can lead 'em right out of town! [BARKING] [GROWLING] Excuse-moi, monsieur president. Hello, minister Chateau. I congratulate you on the magnificent animation on this octopus... it's a truly impressive example of the talents of our robotic industry. Monsieur president, we really need to talk... now! I know you've been wanting a raise, Chateau. Let's discuss that later. [LOUD RUMBLING] Jets! Chateau. You're a genius! [PROFESSOR] They called in the military. Conventional weapons won't work on a figment of imagination. [ROARING] Aah! Stop! He quit following us to chase those jets! [WHIMPERING] Pascal! [WHIMPERING] He makes a nice hood ornament. Don't you think? [SCREAMING] [GROWLING] Its not interested in these diving suits anymore. Let's switch back. [KID SCREAMS, OCTOPUS GROWLS] Please, someone help me. Please! [SCREAMS] Huh... thank you. [GROWLS] Waiter, I ordered some octopus over an hour ago. And I still haven't been served! If you were expecting a tip from me, forget about it! Uh... aah! A giant octopus! Yes, yes, yes, yes. It better be a giant one! [WHIMPERS] [GROWLS] Go get it! Yaah! [GROWLS] Whoa! Look at that guy! I'd better go help him. Vroom. [SCREAMING] [ROARING] The octopus is in the 9th Arrondissement area is evacuated. Deploy all forces. [MOANING] You... you saved my life. I don't know how to thank you. I'm gonna change my name to yours. That's what I'll do. So what is it? Profiterole. You got a middle name, kid? Uh, no. How about your dog's name, then? Come on, get in! 'Cause it's showtime. [MAN] It's a giant octopus! [MAN 2] Beat it you big squid! Aah! Why don't you pick on someone your own size? Help me, please! Huh. Gotta put trash in its place. Thank you, Peter! Sorry about the bullying! Yike! Ground support. Take your positions. SWAT two, standing by. Time to hit the gas. It's just a figure of speech, profiterole. Ooh! [GASPS] [OCTOPUS ROARING] We have missile lock-on. It's cornered! Let's get in there. Fire! [SCREAMS] If this doesn't work. We're doomed. Aah... Here we go! [SCREAMING] What is that? Hold your fire! [SCREAMING] [GASPS] Aah! O-oh...! Oh! Aah! Oh! Ah... What the... oh, yeah! Yes! Whoo-hoo! All right, yes! We did it! Yes! Aha! Whoo! Oh, yeah! Houston! Yea! Oh-ho, yeah! Ha, ha. Ohh! Yeah, ha-ha! [LAUGHING] Oh. [COUGHS] [WHISTLING] Squad three. Returning to base. [VANEELO] Uh... change of plans, pilot. Circle back. And destroy the city! That can't be right. Did you say "right"? You're one of them! There he is, grab him! It's a conspiracy, I tell you! [PETER] So there you have it. That's pretty much our story. With an ending even better than any Jules Verne ever wrote. Because in this story. Guess who got the girl? After operation freedom force, the four of us went on to do some really amazing things. Yeah! Huh. Aristotle invents an Imaginasium app and becomes a high-tech billionaire! Encore, encore. [LAUGHING] Ooh! [PROFITEROLE] Attaboy, Houston! You're moonwalking! Profiterole forms the gas appreciation society. He doesn't date much. Nicole becomes a martial arts star! And an animal rights activist! Ahh. Whee! Ooh-hoo. Aha! And me? Well, I go on to write dozens of books and movies, just like this one. All's well that ends well. Oh, everything's magnifique. You know, in politics, it doesn't matter what you do. It's what people think you did. [LAUGHS] Or, in this case. What they think I did! [PIANO] Started out in chapter one. A story just begun we were lookin' to have some fun and then we'd be done moving into chapter two by then I already knew couldn't get through a day without you, now n I'm learnin' to keep those pages turnin' 'cause this hearts a-yearnin' and my love is burning for my storybook love took me by surprise won't ever recover from that look in your eyes and I hope this romance goes on forever don't care how it ends as long as we're together you're my storybook storybook love storybook love I'd need a lot of chapter three fall my friends could see I had never been so happy and you're the key jump ahead to chapter five I'm feeling so alive and to think the stars used to mind in chapter nine now I'm learning to keep those pages turning 'cause this hearts a-yearnin' and my love is burnin' for my storybook love took me by surprise won't ever recover from that look in your eyes and I hope this romance goes on forever don't care how it ends as long as we're together you're my storybook.
