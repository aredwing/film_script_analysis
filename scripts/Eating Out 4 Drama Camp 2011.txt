Time for your leadership once empty. And your boyfriend then? - They must find yourself a plumber. Oops ... Slides that do not like? - It stimulates. It is expensive, but it is so good for my hair. Wait ... it burns. - Should I stop? Do not stop. It will burn, but I am almost done. You, bastard. Do not stop, or I get blue balls. Honey, this is not what it seems. This does not. Kill me now do not. I'll be ready. I'm ... And ... cut! Brilliant. Well, that's for sure. Now we can certainly take on theater camp. For a hetero make very gay movies. No matter if the characters gay. Genre genre. And if I did this with women, then I was a sexist. The females look like gay men that I use. Then we've come this far. I look like the butt of Ricky Martin. - There is much more blood is needed. You were great, honey. - No, you. No ... you. Vomitus Maximus. "Vomitus Maximus. So I sounded not at all. - "So I sounded not at all '. Whether the characters are gay. Genre genre. On the stage camp! That we may all inside! On the stage camp! GAY-CIDAAL! I have no sense, Casey. You never sense. I had a very bad dream. Alright. I will take care of myself. Do you mind if I foul you back? Because of you I feel like Demi Moore. Honey, I'm all possible dirty things with you. I'm not as been wet since Reagan was shot. Remember that you do not get enough? Let me in, little pig. Godverdehomo's! - Aunt Helen, who is that? This is Andy. I found him in the Myface. You mean fixed 'Facebook'. - Who was talking about the Internet? Sorry, lady, I do not like penises. Andy ... Damn. Were you this morning not to that stage bullshit ... stuff left? Did you do it in my room? My room is full of embarrassing old lady stuff. Aunt Helen! - It really would not be the first time. Bah ... - Shit, we're too late. Exposed ... exposed. Have fun. And no 'bear trekking. You mean 'barebacking' / i. And we do not. - Okay. Hurry back here with that tight ass. Mommy is hungry. Okay, Grandma is hungry. Excuse ... Do you know how much that bag cost? Hey, I'll give you a hand? This is worse than Sex & The City 2 / i. Yes, sequels are never good. Maybe this ... I have already tried. - Okay ... There you go. You are a genius. I'm Lily. - Jason. Is that all? Baggage. - Oh, yes ... that's all. Well, since it is richer than a truck with immigrants. Here you go. - Wait! We have luggage! We have lubricant is required. We need something this tie. Here ... Use this. - Holy teenage werewolf! So ... That stuck. Indeed. Everyone belt? Damn, my belt is broken. Here is another one. I do not mind changing, though. I have previously sat next to Casey. So we already know each other. I'm Benji. As the dog. I'm Zack. As Efron, but with K. God, do it now but you. I'm Casey. As the boyfriend. O. .. God. I did not ... Jesus, will there really be no one not gay? I am heterosexual. So do I. - Really? Really? - Yes, I'm heterosexual. Never judge a book to his haircut. I'm Genevieve. That is French. That you can not pronounce fixed. So call me Jenna ... Vieve. Does anyone know the way? Welcome to Dick Dickey's Drama Camp! So you're the parasite. - The what? Susselman Penny, the little vampire a full scholarship, internship included. Stage? - Yes. You did not think you would succeed with a little talent and guts, huh? No, but I had the word 'stage' not seen in the scholarship application. It was a stage' application. Okay. - I have never received such help. I paid my bills by former cancer patients to detect ... with unpaid hospital bills. I sold my hair, my blood ... my seed ... Everything to get enough money together waged to Dick Dickey's Theatre Camp to build. So you're ready to make hard to fly? I see every experience, good or bad, as a life-enriching opportunity. Of course. - What are my obligations? The dishes, toilets, vomit and shit patrol ... Anything anyone else wants to do. I do this all with a smile. You're really annoying. You know, right? Okay, the berths. Make sure everyone is checked and finished at 15:00. How do I ... - End scene. I can not believe the boys should. I thought the theater camp something broader in mind was. Talk to the leadership. - I will definitely do. I just wanted to help. I know. Sorry, it's ... I'm tired of the ever to explain. Going to the bathroom seems to have been a political statement. Sometimes I just want quiet can shit, you know? I can not shit on a public toilet. This will be a long summer for you. Are you my roommate? - Tentative. - Cool, mixed rooms. I'm Lily. I am Beau. And what's your name? - Casey. Wow, Casey, you're the nicest red I have ever seen. Thanks, but ... I'm blonde. Anyway, you're super. You take the middle bed but. Unbelievable I have two hetero roommates. That's so European. - There is nothing European about straight. If you want to talk about chicks and guns and football, ... I can understand that, though. I am straight, not stupid. In 't seem dead vaginas brain cells. It's not because you're gay, you need to belittle women. Sorry, I did not ... I'm going to see Casey. Why do you say everybody that you're heterosexual? Because I am. Come on ... Ray Charles could see even you stared at his ass. When I heard that they were a couple, I regret that I was so flirted with him. So I said I was straight, the strip in order to make easier. So keep your hetero occur? To everyone? The whole time? I had not yet about it. But why not? This is still a theater camp? That is the ultimate acting exercise. That's actually a very good idea. Yes ... It always says that actors who openly gay, not heterosexual play. But ... with me as a director ... I ... We ... what can really show. I'm your director. Like Scorsese and DiCaprio. Or Whoopi Goldberg and the director Sister Act 2 / i. If she goes undercover as a nun to a school to save. Yes, something not. How does that actually between you and Lily? I have no idea. You know they ... in a transition phase? - Oh, so yes. Well, we're going this summer probably a lot to learn. You must be pleased that we have in other Rooms sleep. - Why do you say that? You had yourself 's see drool about Benji, "as the dog. You drool as much about 'm He does not like me, that does not count. He allowed nothing, he is heterosexual. Well, yes ... The things remain never long straight in your neighborhood. Would he be curious? Try a little less eager to sound. Casey, though he was gay, there would be nothing happen. I would never deceive you. But you would like to. - I am only 'n man. I am only human, but I do not want to fuck other guys. Turn this're not always around. Casey, is that guy bothering you? Who the hell are you? - The guy who you fight like that is going to get. It's all right. Beau ... Zack. Room mate ... boyfriend. O. .. sorry. I will come back later? I was just leaving. I think you you very quickly also start to feel human. Is there anyone so happy that he can call you his friend? He had to treat you like a prince. Damn, there's nothing in here to fuck me. You are never actors. That they told me and Donnie Kendall. It was career day in the first year. They said, "but Word fireman or policeman. Something realistic and useful. " Donnie Kendall listened to their good advice. He gave up his dream and became a cop. Last month I went at his memorial service. He was shot in his face. Well ... not everyone here will become a star. Or open his own theater camp. But this I can say: If you give up your dreams ... even if you end up not with your face full of metal ... you can just as well be dead. You owe it to yourself to to try. Okay, I do not like sycophancy. I'm just a serious actress. - I will be the judge. In two weeks ... will at this stage ... 'Annual Dick Dickey's Theatre Camp Scene Competition 'place. Your assignment is a scene Shakespeare to choose ... and a modern twist to it. For example, Othello with a talk show on the Oprah channel. Or, for example The Tempest / i located somewhere in the space. Also on the Oprah channel. Let your imagination run wild. This year the group wins the greatest show brings ... a holiday with all the trimmings ... generously offered by appointment, in the Triangle Inn in Palm Springs. Because in the real world actors earn prizes. This holiday is mine. One more thing: I do not tolerate sexual misconduct in this camp. Who caught his or her how-ha openly ... 're out. Without refund. I have not had sex 7.5 years. And I'm only become a better artist. End scene. How do you and your boyfriend keep going without sex? This is nowadays not so often anymore. O. .. - Yes. I knew it. What a dick. Pardon? God, you chased me the creeps. That I often hear. Who is the dick? - My boyfriend. What are you doing? My tuition money. Well, why do you date with a dick? I think because I'm like. Why do you love him? Because ... Never mind. What? - I wanted to say: because I've done so much trouble for him to get more. But that does not make sense, huh? Well when you get to Dr. Phil or something. Perhaps you no longer love. But ... - Penny, there is someone puked in the urinal! Make it clean! I'm on my way. Shit hit the fan. You know him? Shit ... How to get there anyway. Go back a gay-erotic scene directing for the match? 'Weather' is a gay erotic scene? Jason has a strange obsession for sexy gay men. I love eroticism in general. But you do not find girls for free do nude scenes. But gay men ... that are naturally sluts. You're not even a bit gay? Yes ... Pipe me otherwise agreed to see how big my dick it is. Pipe but yourself. - Once, my friend. Ever. This is where straight people are talking about. Shut up. Do you like your mouth shut. Look what they have given me. - Be well but happy. I could also share a room those annoying Genevieve. Oh, you mean that "Je ne vah-vah-java. Yes, I would rather put a knife into my face. Dickie kicks are not happy. Did you know that: "I do not like sycophancy." "I do not like sex. I therefore so sociable. " Creepy. Does it bother you if I sleep naked? You say not much, but if you say something ... Bothers me not. Dress it out. Only if I sleep well. Well, good night. Certainly. Good morning, Dick Dickey's theater campers. It's five o'clock in the morning. Time to get up and start acting. The first classes begin over 30 minutes. Are you tired? Then if your character is not. Grab a latte and drag you through. Well, I have a very loose throat. This is important to act a good role to get ... if you know what I mean. Just kidding. The only thing you get if someone from the casting sucks ... A trip to the hospital. If that worked, would Brittany Murphy and I sit across. Brittany Murphy is dead. Really? That is hilarious. That girl could pipes. She was just ... the lullenfluisteraar. Okay, everyone is looking for a partner throat. How are you with the dick? He sits beside me. Where? Hi, Tiffani. - Here I am Mrs. Tiffani von der Sloot. Hi, handsome. What? Do you have a new boyfriend? - He is heterosexual. I am heterosexual. - Well, here are my tits. Do you look him straight? I do not know. I've always been a wallflower. Hey, muthafucka! Place your hands on your throat. Sorry. - Certainly. Now, everyone ... This is the last I of Betty White have learned. Are not they beautiful? You know that really weeds? Makes them less beautiful? You want something? Yes ... I hold auditions for my scene. I make a variation on The Taming of the Shrew / i and ... I would love to have you the role of Kate. Why? No idea, I think you have talent. And why do you think? Well, I think you're beautiful ... and I love your personality. Then you ask a girl out on a date, ... not to audition for you to do. I did not offend. No ... I do have an audition. O. .. super. Boys are so stupid. I can not believe Benji straight. He can not his eyes off of Zack. Why would you still occur as heterosexual? Neil Patrick has yet to all changed? Beware. - What? Poison ivy. - O. .. Thank you. Nature is so creepy. Are you not afraid here? Do you think there is a handsome vampire and take me? Your fingers or a psychopath who spends and shit down your throat. Did you hear that? - Try not to scare me. No, I mean it. O. .. shit. - It is determined only a bird. A very large bird. Duck. There is someone. If someone sees us ... - Then I reckon with 'm off. You mean you 'than to kill? There is someone. Halt! Hands up! Throw us not look! - He had not sat in my mouth. It does not count. 'To be or not. That is the question. " "... To suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. " "Or to put arms in ... against a sea of ??trouble. " "And by opposition to terminate them. To die ... " "To die, to sleep. Nothing more. " "And by sleep ..." - "... To say we end the headache." "And a thousand natural shocks." "That flesh is heir to ..." "It's a crowning achievement ..." "... Who piously desired." "To die, to sleep. To sleep, to dream possible. " Hi ... director. You realize that a man was who auditioned for a woman's role? Are you here for the role of brill who gets hit? What I believe to have seen, is an actor who passed the audition. Are you serious? You do The Taming of the Shrew / i. With all the sexism in it, ... are you one of the few good female roles ... do not give a man in a dress? - Genevieve that is inappropriate. I am a transsexual woman, no man. And I do not need a man for my mind. As much as I detest sex too ... there is nothing I love more than the soft caress of a kusscne. As an actor you need it with anyone can do or anything ... at any time. That's a secret that I Hollywood learned on the Internet. A volunteer? I kiss you, Dick. O. .. no, thank you. VIM: Front in the middle. Now we need a volunteer for this ... pretty girl to kiss. Benji ... Benji! Oh, Benjamin ... you? I think I have a cold. I would not give you my bacteria. - Does not matter, I have so much already. O. .. okay. Someone else? Okay, enough! We get it. Okay, all choose a partner. Put you in two rows, facing each other. Lean your partner. Stare into their eyes. And ... Stop! Everyone in this row a person moves to the left. That is your real kuspartner. And ... kiss! Okay, Benji and Lily, that's good. Okay, Penny, with the tongue, please. Surrender. Oh, this girl really go on, eh? Okay, no fidgeting, Genevieve. I had always to think of cold sores. Why did not kiss her Benji? - Yes, a true heterosexual would not prefer to. I once made a scientific study read. To see if someone is gay, let him handsome to look at naked men. And then look to see if he gets a stiff. Is there a study? - Yes. Hurry, ass pimple! No, you can not make. What is not? You can see a boy's shoes or preferably while he wants. Really? - How beautiful the shoes, under the better. Help me straight. Sorry, I thought you was going on. Everything okay? - Yes, thank you. If you want I am going to sleep with someone. I am a real whore. - Yes, you can see on your face. I knew it! What was that? He stood still with me in the chalk. Penny, that was so stupid. And? - I do not know if his dick was big because he had a stiff ... or because he just has a big dick. How hard was he? Normal ... - If a baseball bat? Or like a big candy bacon? No idea, somewhere in between. But perhaps it was his iPhone or a shoe ... A shoe? When did you last touched a dick? That was my first. What? Congratulations, we apparently a gay kusscne do, comrade. I saw that too just. Ever's kissed a boy? How bad can that be? Frankly, boys often not good cushion. But I do. So ... hold on tight. You did the best audition. I know. So I see you tomorrow at the rehearsals? - Sure. I got the part anyway for the sake of my acting, eh? Yes, purely professional, nothing else. O. .. See you tomorrow, okay? Absolutely. I know Jason from home. He is a top best kid. Probably. - Why do you do Gina George as against him? He's cute and he likes you. Why does he not just from me? He's just nervous. - You do not understand. If a boy likes me, is that a fetish or he is confused ... and thinks he might be with a boy wants and that's not me. It rarely occurs they just like me. I do not know how that is. But I know how guys are. When I recently met Zack, I did for someone else. Zack And then this guy out. And I I sucked him and went out with Zack's ex. Eventually I told Zack so that I actually liked. Maybe Jason just the same. You're a strange guy. You're welcome, anyway. - Yes, thank you for casting me. You mean, thank you to you to cast in a hot scene with Zack. Those guys have problems in their relationship. I want nothing to do with it. That is why this is so perfect. You may have Zack ... without any obligations. Have us therefore cast? I cast you because I want to win. The tension between you is worth an Oscar. What are you doing? Expressions practice. Do you do it. I will plan everything for tomorrow. Is not this delicious? What's better than a whole summer acting? Sex, or at least masturbation. I have not once had the chance. Have you already seen nice girls, Comrade? "Comrade"? Guys say that? In gay porn, maybe. Whether in the South. I never thought much raised by heterosexuals. Yet not since I am out of the closet. Why not? I do not know ... I think I feel better among gay men. It's like I'm back in high school, but now I'm popular. Between heterosexuals and I feel again quite the kneusje. The high school is long ago. What I feel old now. You and me both, pal. I'm just practicing my text with Casey. I'm not getting much chance to be alone with you. Yes, the camp keeps us doing well. Maybe ... Maybe we can not do this. - Well, I would not be kicked out. Lights out in fifteen minutes! / i Shall we practice together tomorrow? Benji and I have our first rehearsal, but I see you in class by Dickie. Sounds great. Is it safe? Why did not you say that you sat there? I was at the clothes. Plus ... I was curious. Well, what is your opinion? Well, your relationship is as the third season of Gossip Girl / i. It was cool, but not anymore. Just make an end. - I know ... I am currently ... Well, I hope it that he belongs. I'm so bad. - Only inside. Okay, in this scene ... Lily plays Kate, confident women who does not want to marry. But your father wants you to link to Petruchio, ... played by Zack. But in my custom version ... you realize that Petruchio actually gay. And he is infatuated with his friend Hortencio, played by Benji. You secretly hope that they have something in get for your marriage ... and if your father's desire impossible. Okay? Yes, there is a lot of kissing. Shall we practice today that pillow? No, we wait a bit longer. I want the voltage is built up, so that ... The explosion shows when it finally is. Agreement? Okay ... Well, we start with the top Zack and Lily. "Good morning, Kate, because that is your name, I hear. " "They call me Katherine who speak of me. " I think that there is indeed going to be kissed. You have no idea Jason directs how such a thing. Here is much more to do than just cushion. The musical theater is back. Everyone is now fan of Glee. This would not be without drama camp a course on musical numbers. The theory goes like this: One person is under the spell of the song. And the rest of the group thereon knows in play, can dance well, ... and so on. Let's see how that works in real life. Zack, VIM. Front in the middle! I'm not such a good singer. That's the beauty of Auto-Tune / i. Theatre is more than learning words, more than bees, birds and bears. 'Tis ever deeper to passion 't first hour. Is the piece in the final phase, then we dive under in ecstasy. All emotions ignite in the highest fire. Passion and reaction, that scene is unprecedented. Shake Shakespeare, but what is on, here you get to see. Play but with the camera as a Drama Queen / i. The whole night! Maybe it does not look out, So get dressed but not yet. Unless you do it does to the public excitement. The screen is on fire. That Drama Queen / i can some of it. But forgets drama than after your final bow. Passion and reaction, that scene is unprecedented. Shake Shakespeare, but what is on, here you get to see. Play but with the camera as a Drama Queen / i. The whole night! That felt so rehearsed. 'Crowns I have in my bag and home goods. And so I pull abroad to see the world. " "Petruchio, I wish you no artful, horrified woman. For in you is my deepest treasure. The jewel of my life be exercised by you. " Text ... "Between friends as we few words are enough. " You should really learn to text. Even I know him already from the head. "Now we have come so far, I continue to approach you have a fun time. " This I know: "I want you, I know you and I will marry you. " And then I kiss Benji. - I'm Casey. I know, but he is Benji. - No, he's Hortencio, played by Benji. Sorry. I get it, you like him. His name is sewn into his underwear. You do not be jealous. How do you know? I'm not jealous. I had it expected, but I'm not. Why are you so dramatically? - I wonder how different it would be ... if he is gay. Today will be sunny with 100% chance of drama. / i The contest is fast approaching. And remember: Okay, class. Today is all about "An animal to be". People say that I am good at. And I mean not only acting like an animal. I mean really a beast. A lion ... A goose ... You absolutely must see the world through the eyes of the animal. Okay? What is this? A jellyfish ... Good? Well ... Casey, choose an animal for Benji. The endangered starling of Rarotonga. A ossenpikker. A cockroach. My wife and I can these animals not stand. Benji, show me your poop ... kerlak. Bold cockroach! Difficult ... At the rehearsal tonight will he really stand for monkey. I thought you cared nothing. - Right. Yet, laughing. I have another idea. - Penny, no! Do not be so ... - Penny! Genevieve wants you as the herpes virus. Boe. Slightly exaggerated. Choose you one animal for Casey. A chicken. 'N Chicken ... Sometimes you have to stoop the happiness to pick. Shit! Oh, God. Hold on, you, pervert. Oh, Benji ... What's happening to me? Are you with someone? Why do you ask? For your character. To see if we are somewhere on to build. Why? Well, your character is an inveterate bachelor. And if you're with someone, can I have him might help forget and replace ... by the idea of ??... a possible ... I'm single. - O. .. Oh, my God. What happened? According to the nurse, it is poison ivy. How did you come in contact poison ivy? And still naked? No, I have not touched nature. It looks very painful. - My whole body looks like a circumcision wound. But we need to practice. The game ... Look at me. I can not. Rehearse without me. Use only Casey. No. - You know all my text. Teach me the rest tomorrow. But ... - Okay. We are going to begin. I have the podium reserved. Sean Penn would have rehearsed. "Petruchio, I wish you no artful, horrified woman. For in you is my deepest treasure. The jewel of my life be exercised by you. " "Between friends as we few words are enough. " "Now we have come so far ... I continue to approach you have a fun time. " "I want you, I know you and I will marry you. " Great. Petruchio, ... lean forward and kiss Hortencio. As if it was your first kiss ever. Are you serious? Yes, yes, Casey. Go for it. Ho ... You're as good as a girl. Clear. Hey, leukerd, and then our scene? Yes ... Zack I will be replaced. Penny, what do you do? - Do not enter! But we need to talk. Zack is in poisonous ivy cases and could not rehearse. Then he did not kiss Benji? No, but I do. What? - May I come in? No, to go along with you to Zack. Are you serious? - Absolutely. "Come, come, you wasp. I think you're too angry. " "If I am a wasp, take heed to my angel. " "My remedy is to pull that off." "O. .. if the idiot m can find. " "Who knows not where a wasp its sting is there? In his tail. - In his tongue. " "Whose tongue? - Yours, if you will tails about it. And so farewell. " "What? With my tongue in your tail? " "With your tongue Hortencio's tail, what would you really like. " "What are you saying?" "Kiss me. Let me see what you love in you. " And then you kiss me. You have to kiss me. I have not come to you. Lily ... Why is everyone leaving today? I'll talk to her. Everything okay? - Why do guys play such stupid games? Because we do not hurt to be done. But it's okay to hurt others. Why do you do if you're heterosexual? He has a boyfriend. I did not make annoying. Yet it is. Where is the old-fashioned romance gone? You know, with the dogs and spaghetti? "Between friends as we few words are enough. " And then I ... Benji the stage and says: "Now we have come so far, I continue to approach you have a fun time. " "I want you, I know you and I will marry you. " Have you kissed? - Yes. Really? How was that? I mean, what movements? You're doing this. Imagine that I am. And then you ... O. .. sorry, I'll come back. We practiced the scene but. - We were just in the pillow. We were not really ... I thought I was your first boy would , but Casey was for me. Why do you do the scene not's with Zack? Really? - Really? Really. Your face looks better already. - From the nurse may I kiss again. Promo. "Petruchio, ... I wish you no artful, horrified woman. For in you is my deepest treasure. The jewel of my life be exercised by you. " "Between friends as we few words are enough. " "Now we have come so far ... I continue to approach you have a fun time. " "I want you, I know you and I will marry you. " I ... - You were very good. Really super. I just go 's sleep. That scene is fantastic. You're a good kisser. In contrast, until the last straight I was with. Zack, I must tell you something. I'm so sorry the poison ivy. - My God, was that you? I must break with him. - What? Why? Zack dumps me because he is too nice. But he's completely fallen for another. And he does not do anything with out of respect for me. But Benji is probably not gay. He had a third leg, when we kissed. But that's not the point. I'm not the one for Zack. And maybe Benji. Or someone else. And he misses it, because he feels guilty towards me. Or maybe I miss the true though. That itches? I feel like Lindsay Lohans pussy. Where do you have lied about? Benji Is it your real name? I wanted you to know. But I did not ruin your relationship. Come on, I do flirt 's. But I look as someone who is cheating? No. I also wanted to protect myself down. I'm really crazy about you. You know what's the worst? I thought I finally had a bond with a heteroatom. I thought my problems had finally overcome, but ... I am still fearful that gay boy. That you are not. What do you know them off? Get up, my dear Dick Latvian. / i Congratulations, you have the last weekend of the camp met. / i There are many more Dicks than I expected. How fun! / I How are your results? The worst is over, but my face will there be some look like Adam Lambert. Jason is there perhaps something on the scene. In those 15 minutes rehearsal still remains to us? He has probably three alternative ready versions. Tonight ... - Zack, I think that we have to separate. What? - Do you mind? Sure you do. - Really? Maybe not. But you'll like much. And I think you behind Benji to have to go. - What? There is something between you and ... that you should investigate further. But you hate him. I hated him only because you are so well suited to each other and ... we do not. He lied that he's straight. Because he likes you, right? - That does not make it okay. I did myself as a very different person to be you can get. Good point. What should I tell him? I think it's all okay, but I ga not his dick in your mouth. You will manage something. Okay, this is the dress rehearsal. So we do the scene, I give you my last instructions. And that's all. So, Lily, remember: you must aggressively are to get what you want. "Come, come, you wasp. I think you're too angry. " "If I am a wasp, take heed to my angel. " This is our last day here. Do you like me now or what? Sorry, Lily. What? - You heard me, Jason. We continue with the scene. If you want to ask me out, then do it. Stop with your excuses to me ever encounter. Can you love me now or am I crazy? Are you confused because I transeksueel am? Be Well 's honest. What about now? - I do not know, okay? Lily, wait! Hold on. I hate guys who play games. Now let's rehearse. - Okay, from your text. "Petruchio, I wish you no artful, horrified woman. For in you is my deepest treasure. The jewel of my life be exercised by you. " "Between friends as we few words are enough. " Especially when it comes to lies. Sorry. "Now we have come so far ... I continue to approach you have a fun time. " "I want you, I know you and I will marry you. " Fantastic. They kiss not. A real kiss. Come on. Which is a voltage ... Better. Another. Good, Benji. Put his shirt open. Pretend I'm not here. We are all for In this scene. Zack, Benji's shirt pulling. But that is not in the ... - Do it now. And keep kissing each other. This is intense. He loves hardcore gay scenes. Benji, climb on top of Zack and rub your crotch against his. Keep kissing each other. Zack, let your finger to slide his ass. Nice and slow. About his sex line. Along his hips. Where the pants and the skin touch each other. Put your finger behind his belt now. A bit. Feel the heat that it ascends. Go there now for all. Get inside now and grab his cock. Benji, you do the same. Benji, pull your pants. Completely. More passion, guys. It should really look like. Your dreams here already your whole life. You never thought this would happen, but it happens. It's better than you ever dreamed of. I'm almost there. - I. I love theater. Yes, go for it. What is this geseks? We practice our scene. It is Shakespeare. Say it, Jason. When Shakespeare was nobody ready. Lily ... I'm sorry. You're right, I played a game. I like you like, very much. I did not know what that meant for myself. But now. You have helped me something about myself. I learned that I was not liberated as I thought. And so I am perhaps have lost a wonderful person. Lily, please ... I have something for you. Jason Williams straight to my office. / i Okay, strange, that's me ... Listen, Lily, I hope you still want to talk with me. What happened? I accepted you in my drama camp ... because I thought your film elegantly showing how sex leads to murder. But this ... I had no social value found in these frauds. Your scene is from the race. We must do something. They are out thrown and it is my fault. I do not know where you're talking about, but I have an idea. Weird, huh? Penny, look's to those results. None of us is good at ideas. Trust me. This is going to work. At the last moment there is a disqualification. / i The 'Annual Dick Dickey's Theatre Camp Scene Competition 'will be continued.

Seven and a half. I also measures 7.5 ". Slap. Oh, my God. - This is hotter than Twincest / i. Jesus, you really have a great talent. You're as crazy as the Black Swan. Otherwise you would never dare to do. That makes it no less idiotic, and now we lie out of the race. Did you really not think I was to the microphone? No. But not immediately. - I knew it. God, I'm so crazy like a door. That was all the way ranked. I can not hear you, I have your dick in my mouth. What? O. .. O God! Oh, yes ... This feels so good! Say my name, Dickey. - Oh, yes ... What is your name? Conor. - Oh, Conrad. Oh, Conrad. Oh, yes, lick my balls. - It's Conor / i C.O.N.O.R. Look at facebook. Casey! Guys, come out. Oh, yes ... Not my ass, I'm shitting. / i Wow ...

Jason Williams is here? I ... I had a speech prepared. About a boy was shot in his face. It's actually much tastier than it sounds ... but you know what? let's just look. "O Romeo, Romeo ... Where thou art, Romeo? " "Thou forsaken my text messages and refuses my calls. "If you renounce my love, I never use a BlackBerry. " "Juliette has blocked me on facebook. " "The more I afzie, the more resentment he gets. " "He married me to let me starve? " - Where were you? Your scene is back in the game, just as she was. I do not even ... - No, you were right. Sex is so important between people. Bla, bla, bla ... Does not matter. Have you seen what nonsense is this? - No, but ... End scene. Whatever you did Dickey caught when you ... You must now do, but even more so. And Lily? I can not find her. I think she wants to know nothing more of me. The show must go on. / i Lily ... - I have to change clothes. And these are the real 'Merry Housewives of Windsor. How dull. - Yes ... Shall we make it official and go on a date? You're only five minutes ago dumped. I want no second choice. And I do not with a guy who acts as if he's straight, but ... that does not mean that nothing is between us. And with my new breast implants I live down happily. Boe ... Hey, you turn Drama Queens / i. "Good morning, Kate, because that is your name, I hear. " "They call me Katherine who speak of me. " "Come, come, you wasp. I think you're too angry. " "If I am a wasp, take heed. " "Where should I be careful?" "Beware of games." "Because if you begin thus, You can not go back. " Not again. Listen, I know who I am and I know who I am not. And that makes me happy, because some never come back. Do you? Dare to follow your heart? "Well, Kate, to whom do you speak these words? " Against him. "I'm sorry, I have this situation never seen before. " What situation? "A situation where ..." A situation where a girl told me that she did not want me. It broke my heart. Absolutely.

You're right. It does not matter how far we have come. Only how we feel when we are together. I'm sorry I lied to you. "Between friends as we ..." his apology unnecessary. "Now we have come this far ..." you give me another chance? "I want you, I know you and I will marry you. " Do it, do it ... That is intense. O. .. Well, it's OK if you're single / i are?
