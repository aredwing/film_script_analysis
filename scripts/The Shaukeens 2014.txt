"It's your grace.." "..that pulled me out of the darkness." "It's your grace.." "..that changed me completely." Sheila, you? What's this? You r g race. MY grace? Nice poster, isn't it? This film will release next week. But right now, you're here to watch Shaukeens(Romantic at heart)" ..so let's focus on that. Delhi, a fun-loving city. Frankly speaking, this city has.. ..more twists and turns than my films. You'll find romance, but at someone's tomb. Drama, at temples. Comedy, at some memorial service. And fights are common on streets. And what makes this city so fun-loving.. ..are the men. Take them for instance. Lali, KD and Pinky. They've all turned 60.. ..but their nature hasn't changed. The sight of a girl.. ..still makes their tail wag. The reason behind their condition" ..is their loneliness. Lali. There's a serious dearth of hair and fun in their lives. Technically speaking, he has a big family. A shoe-store at Connaught Place. And respect in the society. But still lonely at heart. You'll ask why. His wife has turned religious.. ..and distanced herself from married life. Due to which Lali has been showing.. ..a strong interest in fashion. Lali's younger sister, Chanchal. Poor girl got divorced a week after her marriage. And son.. He's a real sample. He deliberately gets pictures taken" ..for posters at his father's shop.. Mom, my milk. And thinks he's a model. Anyway, Lali is not interested in his son. But he's very interested in women. Fed up of the austerity in his house.. ..Lali's found some sanctity at his store. Frontier Boot House for Men.. ..is now Ladies Shoe House. And finally Lali's life has become a bit colorful. "There is no relief from this pain." "Are you a lover or a butcher?" Similarly, his friend Pinky.. ..is dealing with an utterly boring life. Harishankar Goyal. His life is more like an unfulfilled dream. He had to take care of his father's business at a young age.. ..and couldn't complete his education. As soon as he was old enough his father got him married. So no girlfriends. He had kids right after marriage. So no fun with the missus. When his sons grew up.. ..he thought he'll go globetrotting with his wife. But his wife went to the heavenly abode instead. By the way, Mr. Goyal is the richest amongst his three friends. He's the king of Catch Spices at Chandni Chowk. Two sons and their wives. In fact, he's even a grandpa now. But he's unhappy. And so he's got a grumpy nature. But recently he's seen a ray of hope. Hi. Excuse me. "When there is love in the world." "Wonder why this heart asks for more?" An Angel has descended right opposite to him. Angie! I guess Pinky's in love with this masseuse. But there's one problem. 'English.' Frankly, Pinkly loves girls that speak English. And Angie speaks only English. But he doesn't know English. So how can they talk? I guess this love-story will always be incomplete. I feel sad. But not for the next one. Kamal Dheer Sharma, aka..KD. He's the real image of Delhi's passion. He's rich, stylish, overly-connected. ..and a big gloat. And why not. He's a bachelor after all. He's 60, but his attitude is not a day over 30. It's still really easy for him.. ..to befriend females. Pinky considers him as his love and sex guru. But the truth is.. "that sex is miles away from his life. But still..he runs an NGO for widows. He's like an angel for these helpless women. But for KD, this is an opportunity to prepare for the real thing. KD tries these tricks outside too. Because in this ambiance.. ..he can only be benevolent, not a lover. We've heard that in his younger days.. ..KD was in love with someone. "Why to get stuck at one place?" Later she got married.. ..and KD decided never to get married. This is just a rumor. I don't guarantee this story's true. You must be wondering why Akshay Kumar.. ..that's me, is so interested in three old perverts of Delhi? Take a look for yourself. What's wrong, uncle? She's like your daughter. Forget it.. - No, dear. You don't know these old men. They come here to get in the mood. Stop talking rubbish. You've been doing dirty things behind the bush.. ..and blaming me of being ill-mannered. Do you see that? Such shameless kids these days. Stop all this. Or I'll have you thrown out of the park. Hey old man.. Gentleman. Gentleman. Stay in your limit! Gentlemen..please don't fight. They are sorry. You can continue. You can please carry on. They are sorry. Okay, let's go. He was misbehaving. Why did you have to apologize? - Yes. We weren't the ones behind the bushes. - Right. I would've ruined that boy's career.. ..even before it took off. Do you know who I am? I don't know about you. But I know who I am. How embarrassing was that cheap behavior of yours. What cheap, embarrassing behavior? What did we do? - Not us, you. Why did you have to peak in the bushes? If that boy hadn't interfered" ..he would be sitting on her lap. Don't be so ridiculous, Lali. lam ridiculous. I am the Secretary of the Shopkeeper's Committee of our area. We can't act so cheaply in the open. Try to be discreet. Mr. Lalwani, how are you sir? Hello, Mr. Sehgal. It's been a long time since you've been to my shop. I definitely will, sir. When is the committee meeting? Next Friday..Friday the 13th. Give my regards to Mrs. Sehgal. Okay. - Okay, see you. See. People respect me a lot. Not like you two. Lali, you're overdoing it now. Look, Pinky. Abuses and name-calling may be common in Chandni Chowk. But not here. This is an educated society. Get that? Why do you stress so much on education for everything? I've got an Audi. So what? - Enough, stop this. Stop fighting amongst yourselves. Don't waste a Sunday. So what's the plan? Tell us. The plan's right ahead. Come on. On the right. On the right. - I did. 2..3..and bend! 2..3..and up! What a sight? I can say she's married. I don't think so. - 200%. But you know.. Married girls don't satisfy me anymore. Look to your left, foreigners. Ogling secretly is no more fun. What are you doing? Put on your spectacles. ..or else people will know what we're staring at. How long will we just watch? Take my advice, let's get some action tonight. Action. - What? There he goes again. Let him speak, Lali. What do you mean action? Escort service. Girls will come home. No, it's not safe. It's absolutely safe, Lali. This is Delhi. You can get everything with just a call. Lali, you backed out the last time as well. Let's try it once. We might get lucky. - Only boys do such things. We're respectable people. What if someone spots us at the hotel? And these days they make MMS clips. Who's talking about hotel? My idea, my risk! The action will take place at my farm house. Where the hell are they? Did you give them the right address? - 200% I don't have a good feeling about this. Let's cancel this. - No.. Here come the girls. My babies.. Come on. Come on. They are old. You said it's a bachelor's party. Not a bachelor's party" ..l said the party is bachelor. Look What if they get a heart attack? Kid, its short work. Do it, please. Dude, they're real old. Who are you calling old? Come on, turn the car around. Come on. - Who are you calling old? Stop the car. Hey.. Who are you calling old? Cheap girl. You call us strong men, old. KD. Vicky. The DCP of Janakpuri is my buddy. I'll shut down yourjoints. Calling me old. I won't spare that pimp. He doesn't know who I am. Cool down. A cassata for him. KD, your planning is never any good. You weren't in the mood at first. Then you were. Then you lost it. As the girls left, so did my mood. This is the worst Sunday of my life. We did not do anything and the rascals called us old. Pinky.. - Forget it. Sunday isn't over yet. It is. - Look around. Take a look. That girl gestured towards me.. ..and turned towards that tree. We just flopped badly a minute ago. Your name should be KLPD, not KD. Lali, by God, I am not lying. What do you want to do? - Come on. No! Come on. For the sake of our friendship, let's go. We'll have to talk to her first. lam an expert in talking to girls. Have trust. Come on. But..what will you say? Hello. There are three of us. And we even have a car. We live close-by. Darling. - Yes. I'll just call you back. Three oldies are trying to get fresh with me. I'll set them straight first. What were you saying? - Who weren't flirting? Police! Police! - We were just leaving.. Where are you going? Dear! Dear! Please forgive us! Dear. Don't touch me. - Calm down! Calm down, for God's sake. ! You- Pay me? For what? Who do you think I am? It was a mistake. Police! Police! - What's wrong, madam? Why are you hugging this old man? Inspector, these three old men were harassing me. And this one.. He was saying obscene things. Inspector, take them to the police station. Make them lie down on ice slabs and beat them. He's like your father, dear. You shouldn't say such things. Again.. - Hold on. Don't you own a shoe-store at CP. Yes. Shoe-store. Beat him with his own shoes. Madam, calm down. Listen up, everyone will have to come to the police station. - No. Hari Singh, get these old men in the van. Madam, you may leave. Come on. Inspector, there was a bit of misunderstanding. I only asked her.. ..whether we can drop her home. She was all alone. Its late night. He's absolutely right. We're respectable people. You know me. It was all a mistake, forgive us. Mistake? Forgive you? But..what pill did you all take" "that made you so pervert at this age? You're right. We'll stay in control. Lali. Pinky. We've to work on this. - Yes. You must be just a few years older than my father. These things don't suit you. Point noted, son. Bless you. How much do you have? Check it. Must be around 10.. - ls that all? Do you take credit card? Are you crazy? Come on, get lost. And listen, I've a free advice for you. If you're all feeling so erotic" ..then, there's nothing you can do here. Go to some foreign country. These things are legal out there. Do you know any place where it's all legal? Bangkok. You can find 50 girls at every 500 meters. All like those. Are you sure? - 200% Delhi's no longer safe for us. Take my advice, let's get out of here. To the capital of debauchery. Bangkok. Bunty. Rim. Bring my food. Quickly. Right away, father. Come on fast. Lucky, get my pajama. Blue or white. Bring the blue one. But..the blue one's wet. Get the blue one. Heat the lentil little more. Or he'll get furious. And I've to talk to him about Mauritius. It's wet. Father, I told you the blue one's wet. Get the white one. Yes. Where's my food? Father" You know Bhanu..our distributer in Mauritius. He's invited us to Mauritius. He'll pay all the expenses. If we could go to Mauritius for a week. Go ahead. And anyway, I am going on a holiday with KD and Lali. To Bangkok. Bangkok? Bangkok? Father, Bangkok? What happened? Father's going to Bangkok. What? Bangkok, at this age? What's wrong with it? There's a Buddhist Temple. Dense forests. Also one-tusk elephants. But, father..you can see those" ..in Ram Nagar and Corbett too. And Ranchi's full of Buddhist temples. But why Bangkok? And father, everyone will laugh at us. Everyone knows what goes on at Bangkok. But we didn't know. Now that I do, we won't go. O kaY- It needs more salt! Brother, how's KD? KD? He's still the same. Jolly. He hasn't come home for a long time. Has he gone out? He's still in the city for now. But going out next week. Where? On a holiday, with Pinky and me. Bangkok. What? You three are going to Bangkok. Who's going to Bangkok? - Your father. O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! Listen" Dad, you? - Why? What happened? What is there? It's heaven for those who are starving. Starving? Starving for what? You got to be kidding me. Dad, what will we say.. ..if anyone asks where you are. Bangkok? You don't need to lie. What's so special about it? We're going to see the one-tusk elephant" ..and Buddhist temples. ls there anything else? Trip to Bangkok means characterless certificate. Correct. O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! What are you doing? Brother, if you're going to Bangkok take sister-in-law along. Dad, I'll sue you. Why does a 60 year old man need to go to Bangkok? I've never been there, how can you? Stop that. O Lord! O Lord! I was going with my friends.. ..because the tickets were cheap. I am not anymore. HaPPY- Disgusting. Embarrassing. Disappointing. What's wrong? What is he saying? He's getting furious in English. Obnoxious. You're a bachelor. We've a family. We need to consider few things. Why did you get married, and have kids? It's futile to make any plans with you two. Your spices have made our life hell. Bollywood heart-throb Akshay Kumar.. ..was shooting at Film City" ..when a big horde of girls charged at him. Akshay was there to shoot an ad for Dollar Vests. But the situation got out of hand.. ..and he had to leave halfway through the shoot. During this time, Akshay's foot. ..was caught in the door of his car. After which he bashed up his bodyguard. The film stars are the ones who really live it up. We're nothing compared to them. Akshay's next film's shooting location will be Mauritius. ..where he'll spend a long time. Then I'll have to tell Bunty. He's going there with daughter-in-law. For a week. Mauritius. Hold on. Bunty. -Yes. Your Bunty? - Yes. You see, we export raw spices to Mauritius. And our distributer has sent two invitations. I mean, for Bunty and his wife. He can even send three. Yes.. Touch! Touch! Cheers. - Cheers. Bu nty. Lucky. Papa, dinner is served. Papa, white or blue? Leave that, sit. Sit here. Bunty, tell Bhanu in Mauritius. ..to send three invites, instead of two. No, father. Sonu's still too young. And there's no point in taking him along. He'll spend the week with his uncle and aunt. I wasn't talking about Sonu. KD, me and Lali are going to Mauritius not Ritu and you. And us? You can go to Ram Nagar and Jim Corbett National Park. And you can even visit Ranchi on your way back. It's filled with Buddhist temples. What? - Yes. Go and tell him. - Yes. Father, blue or white? You pack the bag. Yes. - Go. "Romantic at heart."

But..will the girl stay with us? No, she won't. - Then? Just like we're out on a holiday.. ..so is that girl. But the house will be all ours. What's the point then? If the girl isn't there" Whether the girl's there or not.. ..but her scent will still be there. What good's that? Are you done already? "When the bangles clinker.." "..and the anklets tinkle."

You don't expect me to go naked. Stupid. Don't just stand there, get ready. Should I take the Shilajeet? Hello. What's that? - Underwear. You expect me to wear pajamas to the beach? Didn't you bring swimming trunks? No, those nylon trunks make me itchy. I'll disown him in public. Hey" You knew we were going to Mauritius.
