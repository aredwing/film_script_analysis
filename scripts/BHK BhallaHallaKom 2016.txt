Lot of people flock to this city in search of their dreams. Only few can fulfill them. Actually, your success depends on your efforts and your bad intentions. Err, I mean your good intentions. I can't say about others but this is what I believe in. Before passing away my mom gave me a lot. Like honesty, hard work, self respect etc. etc. And my dad gave me two-step brothers. But I don't hold any grudge against anyone neither my dad nor GOD. Everyone is happy where ever they are. And I am happy and content away from everyone in this city. I think such things keep happening in life. Ladies first. Thanks. - Your welcome! Hi sir! You're seven minutes late gentleman. Seven minutes eighteen seconds sir. Actually sir.. my watch stopped working. When ones time is not favorable.. ..even the watch can stop working right on the day of the interview. You are right sir. Sit! Tea? - No thanks sir! Oooh... I am Sorry. Thank you. I must say you have a great sense of humor. Pardonl! Boom, M.A, in political science. ..then business management. ..seven jobs in two years and finally jobless. Well no one can dare to take his career so | ight | y.. ...unless he has a sense of humor like yours. Sir, I have a request from you. Could you please go through my resume once again? I don't think I've mentioned anywhere thatl like being insulted. Perhaps you do like quitting jobs, right? No sir, actually I just resigned from three jobs. Other two didn't like me so they chucked me out. Regarding the 6th job, well we mutually hated each other. And the last one, we were pretty much happy with each other.. ..but the company crashed. So you never managed.. ..to find any reason to stick to the jobs you left yourself. May be not. So how can you assure me.. ..that you won't find an excuse to leave this job as well. Don't you think sir that things can be the other way round. Or we both might start disliking each other. And what if your company crashes a... Pooja was telling me that you work in stocks. Yes I still do the same and in a loss of 2 lac Rs. Look here young man.. ...there is no harm in considering yourself smart and intelligent. ..but we ought to achieve something with this intelligence in life. I've worked very hard to reach here. Gracias 5. One of India's top financial company. It took me 30 odd years to make Gracias 5 number one company in India. And you are taunting someone of being a loser who is not even 30 yet. I don't care if you are a loser even after thirty years from now. But I am worried about my daughter. And I can say without hesitation that after meeting you.. .. | am even more worried now. How much will you charge to leave my daughter alone? What? Well sir.. this is the dialogue which all fathers say.. ..be it a film or real life. So lets come to the bottom line sir. Ok Mr. Dha | | a.. - Bhalla. Hmm? - Yes. Pawan Bhalla. Ya ya whatever Bhalla-Dhalla... it all sounds the same. So lets get to the main point Mr Bha | | a.. ..my daughter spends at least Rs. 50000 a month. She has a car, a house and she has bank balance. Sir... And she has mother as well. Get yourself an apartment of your own by 13th in this city.. ..Pooja will be yours forever. In just two days? lam talking about next month's 13th Mr. Bhalla. Kindly note down the date.. ..or Lakhani's son is coming from U.S.A on 14th.. ..and returning back on 21st. I'll arrange engagement and the wedding in that one weeks time.. ..and Pooja will be leaving with him to U.S.A... ..and then I wonder how will you manage to calculate your loss. You are asking me to buy an apartment of my own in just one month.. ..and that too in a city like Mumbai. Do you really think it's possible? Everything is possible for you Mr. Bhalla. I've full faith in you. A sharp witted man.. ..with experience of 7 jobs in two years can do wonders. lam sure owning an apartment in one month is no big deal for you. And listen. ..my advice is that please don't consider this task as some job.. ...or I am afraid you are going to quit this one as well. Don't worry Mr Badlani, it won't happen.. ..whether its your wish or your fear. "I've no idea.." "..which path to follow to breath." "I've forgotten everything without you." "Please come and teach me how to live." Please give him at least one chance. What if it was your dad's company. ...would you have still felt uncomfortable? Now you are twisting things around. "Please enter in my life through my heart." "Please come for me sometime." "Please come." "Please come my love." "My bangles have stopped tinkling without you." Now how much we should wait for him.. ..he reached nowhere in his career even in five years. I don't understand now is our wedding and my job connected.. ..every thing is going on smoothly in my share market thing. And things can get a little bumpy in life. Ever since you left college life has been bumpy for you. ...and I feel that I don't exist in your scheme of things. "My life's void can't be filled without you." There is some problem with your Pawan Dhalla. Bhalla! Dad has been forcing me to get married. "Please come." "Please come." Please join dad's company. It was very tough to convince him. I don't want to lose you baby. "Please come my love." "Please come my love." Mr. Khanna! - Good evening Mr. Chintan. Sorry... I... No, no, Mr Khanna, why are you getting confused? It's your apartment. Oh rea | | y!! I was running short of sugar so I came here to get some. I hope you have got it. - Yes, yes. Thank you Mr Khanna. Lovely Bhai (Brother). Where were you Bhai? We were missing you. Oh actually my wife was not letting me go. She gave me this t-shirt to wear and said "This is the best for me." And you...how many times do I need to tell you.. ..that don't ever let Chintan come here. Yes, Bhai. - "Yes, Bhai." How come you are not seen in the gym these days? And hey what's wrong with him? lam going to quote a poem. Oh yes, Bhai please do. "When a father is getting worried.. ..coz his daughter is crossing the marriageable age." "He damn cares about anything Whether its said by ruffian or sage." "Then who the hell are you and me." Wow lovely Bhai that's awesome. - I just rhymed the thought. Excellentl! Hey Gagan just look at your friend he can't even handle one girl.. ..and now look at me, I keep everyone happy. I've told my wife that I'll be back home soon.. ..but won't go early. because. ..one can't enjoy the same dish every day. Hey you guys remember it. Phone call. - Shhhhhhhhh. Yes sweetheart. Have you reached for that meeting of yours? Yes sweetheart, I reached long back. I'll be back home in 1 or 2 hours. - Ok then I'll wait for you. Oh no no no please don't wait for me. I might get a little late. - Why? No, no, no, I won't be late. I'll be home soon. Ok bye. - I love you. I love you. I love you. You ought to do all this if you are a family man. Everyone does it. Be it Manmohan or Chunnilal. I can understand you saying " | love you" to your wife.. ..but I fail to understand why are you so bloody scared of her. How dare you? Bhai actually what he meant was. ..why do every time your wife call, you get so nervous? Bhai, I apologies if I've annoyed you. I am also totally sorry Bhai. Come here. Well I am not nervous or scared of her. It's just that she is my lucky charm. Lady luck, lady luck. I was a broke before getting married to her. But after marriage.. ..it's her father's business, which I am running. I am king now. Got it? She is here. Ok you guys leave now. I'll meet you tomorrow. Pa rty is over. Move. - No in mood to go. I said leave now. See you tomorrow. Move, move. Move, move. Actually Mr. Khanna, I need some sugar. My wife is making a sweet pudding.. ..more the sugar better the pudding tastes. Jugnu, please give him some sugar. - Yes Bhai. I am so sorry for the inconvenience lam causing you Mr. Khanna. Oh no no! On the contrary you are bearing all the inconvenience Mr. Secretary.. ..that every time you have to walk all the way for such tiny things. You do one thing.. ...please note down our phone number.. ..and whenever you need anything just send the message. ...we'll happily deliver it at your doorstep. Give him the whole box. Here is your sugar. Pudding will be ready in some time. Please I insist you taste that. Oh no no! Thank you so much. No we are fine. Actually what I was saying... - Thank you. Good night. Good Night. - Good Night. Bloody bastard! - Bloody bastard! Hey listen brother. Let me make this clear to you guys as well.. ...lets not mix up business and friendship. ..make sure both of you clear all the due payments as soon as possible. Yes Bhai, we'll clear all the dues. Hang on a minute I think he is here again. Lovely Bhai (brother)? - Oh please don't call me brother.. ...call me only Lovely, Lovely Khanna. Pinto Bhai has sent me. Please come in. You have arrived at the right address. Please come in and you guys leave now. I'll meet to tomorrow. Do you love me or not? Ofcourse, I love you. Then why did you upset papa? Can't you keep quite Pawan? Same, I told him the same thing but he got pissed. Gagan, Will you please keep quite? - Ok. See Pooja... - What do you want me to see.. ..what do you want me to listen? I've been trying my level best to make your good impression in front of dad. ..and you've been spoiling everything by throwing an attitude. Just think before you speak Pooja. If I can compromise my self-respect and go there.. ..what makes you think I would be inclined to throw an attitude. I think it's been your dad's childhood dream to be able to insult me one day! Why would my dad insult you! What could be his problem with you? Why? His daughter has chosen a man who is apparently way below his standard.. ..isn't that a big enough problem? Okay, okay! So that is the end of the matter. There is no point discussing this chapter. You haven't done anything nor has dad.. ..so who is left to be questioned? Me? It's me who has insulted both of you! Right? There is a limit to everything Pooja! Even I have had plans for our marriage and future. ..and I want them to materialize. ..but not at the cost of my self-respect. He was just hell-bent at proving in interview. ..that quitting jobs is my second nature and I like losing. Your dad cheated me on the name of interview. He doesn't want us to get married. What rubbish is this? Get an apartment of my own in just a month. It's not a joke to get an apartment in just one month. Don't you think it's joke or what. You are absolutely right. Papa fooled you today.. ..and you know what I am a fool past five years. ...believing that you can do anything for me. Actually... you know what Pawan, the thing is.. ..you both are right and justified in your own ways. The problem is with me. lam at fault because I am born to a rich father. And I am at fault because lam in love with you. No Pooja please baby don't cry. Please don't worry. See, everything will be alright. See we will get married in the court quietly and peacefully. I will handle everything baby. No one will get to know. Very good. Very good. So this was only left. ...involving court, police, lawyers. De-fame in the society. So what the hell you want me to do. Do you want me to rob for making house? Steal? ls this what what you want? Did I say this? Did I say this to you Pawan? Should I make some tea for you guys? Baby, baby, baby. Pooja! Pooja! Pooja! - Don't touch me. Let me go. Dude you go and see an astrologer. lam telling you... Oh please I don't believe in all this. My dear Consulting an astrologer can only help you to get out of this mess. Oh please save these filthy tricks for someone else. If you really want to help me, give me an idea to get out of this. Actually one thing can surely be done bro. What? No...but first I need you to promise me something. What is it? I don't want you to get all touchy about your self-respect. Oh come on now shoot it. - No, no, no, no, no way. You ought to promise me first. Ok done. Now tell me. You should crack a fake deal.. ..and get some one e | se's apartment transferred to your name. That's a crappy idea. Actually... it's not a bad idea. Yes sweetheart tell me. - Have you reached office? Oh yes. I did long back. Why? Something important? Why? Can't I call you without anything important? No, no, no... It's not that honey. You can call anytime. I was asking just like that. Tell me Neelu. Make sure you are back by 9 pm. Then I'll tell you something important. Sweetheart I will be back by 8:45 pm. My dear Neelu. Ok bye darling I love you. - Hmm love you. Brother Let me handle. - He's here. ls it really hot or it's just me who is feeling hot. Yes Bhai, it's damn hot today. Bhai, drink it quickly or it'll get flat. Okay. Wow brother, what a beautiful painting! You are truly a great artist. Ok tell me now what is it? Actually Lovely Bhai.. ..we have come up with a new plan for business. So we thought to discuss it with you. Ya ya sure go ahead and discuss. Start business, make money... ..and give me back my money. That's exactly what we were also thinking lovely Bhai. Yes Bhai. - Please have a look at this. What is this? Please just go ahead and have a look at it. See I am a professionaL. .. | read people's faces and not such crap. Tell me clearly what is all this about? Lovely Bhai, actually we are thinking of opening a such restaurant. ..in which every item will be 50-100 rupees lesser than every restaurant. But by doing this we won't be compromising on quality. Yes Bhai, everything would be so inexpensive. ..that the people will prefer eating in our restaurant instead of their homes. We have already asked at least 500 people.. ..they have confirmed that they will eat in our restaurant. Yes Bhai and it is going to be first hotel in Asia.. ..where people are going queue up to eat. Correct. This is our business plan Lovely Bhai. Ok tell one something? - What is it Bhai? Did you ever fall from the stairs in your childhood? No! "No! Did any of your teachers hit you or knocked you on your head? No, not at all, never. Or a leather ball had hit your head while playing cricket? No Bhai never ever. - No Bhai. But why are you asking all this? Actually I really want to know.. ..how can such pathetic ideas come to your brain and why? Bhai why are you saying this? What is wrong with our idea? Wrong? I know you guys inside out. If you are left naked on a road.. You can't even manage to buy an underwear for yourself. How on earth you'll open a restaurant? Who the hell will give you money forthat? Bhai we have a brilliant scheme to sort that out. ..and we'll be able to open the restaurant in no time. Trust on us. We can do it. Ok then do it. If you guys are so confident then open it. It's your idea, your restaurant. I said all this since you asked me what I felt about it. okay...so tell me when are you opening it? Tell me the date? - Well. ..net month he is getting married.. ..then after 6 - 7 months we'll open it. Won't we? - Of course yes. His marriage plans are already in deep shit. How can you dream about getting help from there? No no please don't worry about that Bhai. I'll manage everything on that front. - Okay. We just need your blessings. No, no, no, no way, no blessings for you guys now. He already owes me 75 thousand and you owe me 80 thousand. No Bhai we don't want your money. - Then? Bhai you do know everything about case. Yes I do. so? So... I was thinking that... Bhai you transfer your Kandiva | i's apartment to his name. Only in papers Bhai. Only in papers. Whose idea is this? His! He was the one to come up with this idea. His brain is sharper then mine. Shut you up buggers. lam the only one you find to make fool. I've been helping you in the past. ..that doesn't mean that you will make a fool out of me. Get the hell out of here. Listen Bhai, you are getting us all wrong. I am getting everything crystal clear. God has blessed me with sharp brain too. And I know you guys inside out. Don't you dare to think about my Kandivali flat. I'll throw you guys from the terrace of the same apartment. Just the get the hell out of here bloody buggers. We also have come from decent respectable families. Shut up and get out. Let's go. - Move, move. And listen make sure you clear all your debts as soon as possible. Yes Bhai. - Yes Bhai. Let's go. Bloody frauds. Tell me how is it? It's very nice. Have it first and then tell us. You know Moti has specially made it for you. Oh really! Wow! Let me taste it. Wonderful Moti. I told you sister, he really cooks well. It's fantastic. You are a very good cook. Ok sweetheart, what was that important thing.. ..for which you have called me in the morning? Actually they had to give up their home so that a road could be built.. ..so from now on both of them will stay here permanently. In fact you should give him some work in your office. He will get the hang of every thing with in no time. Moti is pretty smart. - He is very smart. Of course he is smart that's why he has come straight here. What? Errrr... I mean they both will be staying here, right? Of course, they will stay here for few days. ..and then they will shift in our Kandiva | i's flat. ..any which ways its lying vacant only. What are you doing brother? I'm trying to find a small trace of shame on your face. It's nowhere visible. You've insulted us both with your bogus idea.. .. | am just wondering if you are feeling a little ashamed. I wish I could put a statutory warning on all alcohol bottles. "DONT GIVE BOGUS ADVICE YOUR FRIENDS AFTER DRINKING" You dumbhead. Can't you call before coming? I am sorry brother in law. - What sorry? Cant you inform beforehand? - What happened? I am so sorry brother in law. - Sorry, sorry, sorry. What happened? Sweetheart we can't give them that Kahdivali flat.. ..because it is already been sold out. Sold out? - Yes. When? - Today. Today itself I got the deal locked. But what was the need to do that? Actually I was running short of some money for a new project. ..so I decided to sell it off. why are you looking at me like this? You are not lying? Are you? Why are you saying so sweetheart? You know I am telling you the truth.. ..and you know it very well how much I love Moti. We don't have any one apart from him whom we can call our own. Are you still suspecting me? I swear over Moti's head that flat is SOLD OUT. Why are you not believing me? I got the advance money from Mr. Bhalla this morning. Bhalla? - Err... Mr. and Mrs. Bhalla. These are the people who have bought our flat. Very nice and well to do people. Let me make a call to them right now right here in front of you. They consider me as an elder brother. Hello. - Yes Bhai. Yes Mr. Bhalla... - Yes Bhai. Speak. Please get the balance amount by tomorrow. Okay. Let's finish this off. - Okay Bhai. Okay. She stays in this same building. Do you want me to get into trouble? Ladies first. How sweat! Thanks. Bhai, all these cheques are for 10 thousand each.. ..we haven't mentioned any date yet.. ...we will inform you as soon as we arrange for the money. ..and then you can withdraw. - And how soon will this happen? Very soon Bhai. - Pretty soon Bhai See pals. ..whatever happened with you guys yesterday. ..after you guys left I felt bad about that. .. | shouldn't have spoken to you guys like that. Yes Bhai. - Come again? Yes brother. - What do you mean by yes? When I am realising it on my own.. ..do you think it's required for you to open your silly mouth? Sorry Bhai. So finally all said and done... ..you guys are my friends. ..if I wouldn't help you in problem then who else. So.. I are ready. Really. Thanks you so much Lovely Bhai. - But, but, but... I want a partnership in your restaurant thing with you guys. It's a solid idea I must say, very solid idea. What do you say? Ok... done Bhai. Great. Let's get started. Now this will be fun. Ok Mr. Makkar. Please have this Bhai. - Tell us what how to proceed. Well Mr. Lovely, technically speaking. ...we need all the papers to be formed under Mr. Sheila's name.. ..since his marriage is a problem. My marriage isn't a problem Mr. Makkar. I am in love.. ..and that's the reason I am getting married. ..but unfortunately people are creating problems. Yes... thats the reason why we are here, isn't it Lovely Bhai? Bhai, I am planning to make papers in such a way.. ..that we can usurp Mr. Dha | | a's ancestral dhaba for your safety. No no my safety lies within Mr. Bhalla. What? Safety... lies within me? We | | ... | mean we'll go technically about it.. ...but papers need to be under Mr. and Mrs. Sheila's name only. Okay. But I am not yet married Lovely Bhai. I know that very well. But as they say that if girlfriend's life is on stake... ..her lover will never dare to cross the line of control. Bravo!! Mr. Lovely. Wow Lovely brother. - Okay. Okay I got the drift. But here is request Mr. Makkan. ...please make sure the papers are full proof and solid. What the crap is this! Makkad.. Makkad.. ..it's ourjob. What are you saying? - Listen Mr. Bha | | a.. ...I've been working with Mr. Lovely past twenty years now. lam not a novice. Oh okay, okay, okay. Sorry, sorry Mr. Makkad. Thank you. Thank you Bhai. Thank you so much. Oh forget thanking. How on earth are you going to explain Bad | ani.. ..about this sudden wealth and property? Bhai share market can take person from rags to riches. But you will have to vacate the flat after 10 days of your marriage. Bhai share market can bring you from riches to rags too. You are bloody shrewd, Bhalla. I hope you've not done anything wrong, have you? Oh come on Poop. ..your dad is such a good human being. lam sure you can learn much more from him then just being a sceptic. Please Pawan, I am not doubting you. I am just... - Listen baby listen, listen to me. Pooja, we tend to invest in relationships. Only when we foresee a bright future in them.. ..but share market runs on the reverse principle. It's most lucrative to invest when share market is in loss. ..and Khatana uncle was wise enough to understand this trick. So he bought shares through me.. which were running on loss at that point of time.. ..and this deal has given me huge money. That's it. Thats's all baby. Okay. lam sorry baby. - It's, its okay. Papa will be so happy to know all this. Errrr... no... please don't. Don't tell your dad about it. - Why? Let me get the possession first. I want to give him a surprise. lam sure he will be ecstatic by getting this news. I don't believe this. So I want to see his face when he receives this news. Please take your time to read it sir.. ..as you can see Pooja is owner of this property. What a beautiful thought. Now we need to look into our wedding preparations. ..on | y 10 days are left. You are the best. I love you baby. Please ask Mr. Lakhani to look for some one else for his son. I love you too baby. Sir please let me know if you need any kind of help from my side. There is no difference between a son and a son in law these days. Moti.. - Yes, sister. Your brother in law can't even dare to se | | .. ..a waste bottle without my permission. lam wondering how has he sold off a 2 crore apartment. That's what. You have given lot of freedom to brother in law. He is a small kid who needs to be controlled. I mean he is not that smart and intelligent businessman like you. Am I right Panna? - Yes. Deal for the flat got fixed overnight. And no one got a clue. Any way how does it matter to me. Bhalla! You can go and stay at your mom's place. Hello. I will manage to get refuge anywhere. Either here or somewhere else. If not somewhere else then here only. Mr. La | wani.. - Yes Mr. Badlani. I want know if Mr. Pawan Bha | | a.. ..is the actual owner of this property or not? Please handle this case with utmost secrecy. As this matter is connected with my daughter's well being and her future. And you belong to similar community. ..you know very well that the information leak can spoil our image. Sister, I am not your real brother. I think that's the reason why brother in law is treating me like this. Had I been a real brother? You are my cousin but more than my real brother. Mr. Badlani, looks like papers are pretty strong. Even before, 2g and Adarsh had strong papers. ..but ultimately they were all proven as a hoax. You both are not going anywhere. You both will stay in my Kandiva | i's flat. But that is already sold out. This is what your brother in law is claiming. Then? How will we get to know about it? You are talking to Lalwani brothers & Associates Mr. Badlani. We know where the problem is? What do you mean? I mean you go and find out what is the truth behind this entire. Find out if he is lying? - Me. Sister... he is very good at doing such things. I never watch any detective series with him sitting next to me on TV. He predicts the murderer in the very first scene. Panna be quite. If what I am doubting is proven right. .. | am going to his take his case left right and centre. I want results within a week. We don't need one week to solve this case Mr. Badlani. Our agent Tony D'costa will crack it in 4 days. Tony? Winters have bought snow storms. ..nothing is left anywhere in the fields or gardens. except for crows and naked trees. Rosy enough. Now stop it your acting. This time I will make a full proof plan. Where were her Licenses kept? Must be in her bag. Yes Tony tell me. Yes Babbu Bhai.. - Yes. 6,3,9 for Mumbai Laxmi and 5 and 8 Mumbai gold.. ..send hundred-hundred for all. Oh God... you'll always play with the wrong number. Bet on reverse of 5, Zero.. it repeats very now and then. Okay do one thing. Add zero of 100 Rs. and send me the tickets. Tell me how much will you clear from the balance? Babbu Bhai, you're always anxious. Once I win.. ..you will be the first person with whom I will clear all my debts. I swear by mother Mary. Do you think theses clothes are enough? lam not going to spend my whole life here, these are enough. Hello sir. Okay, you push the button. Lift is here. It's done sir, give me 100 Rs. Your whistle could put me into problem you fool. Thank you. The one in blue t-shirt is Mr Bhalla. - Okay. Two. Five. Six. Seven. Daddy. Who was it? Forget it. Come let's go. But I heard someone was screaming. Papa! who is it? Oh my God! Now you people have starting begging on doorsteps. But look at you, You're too dressed up for begging.. ..no one is going to give you anything like this. Because every one is not as smart as Chintan who can read faces. Anyway now that you have come all the way to beg.. ..stay here, I'll get you something. Oh please don't sing. You guys have no music sense. Hey uncle you speak a lot. I need first-aid. Let's start the task. Hail James Bond 007 Moti. Where has he gone? You beggars have so much attitude these days. You don't even have the patience to wait at one door. Come here take this. Go and have this with your whole family. Enjoy it's taste fullest. And don't dare to come this side again.. ..or I will call the cops to put you behind the bars, understand? Ok now leave from here immediately. Move now. Get out from here. Hello, hello, hello, hello. One! Give it to me. Who the hell are you? Hey watch your tone. Hello, Answer me. Hello. No no Lovely Bhai, issue is.. ..actually one imbecile was calling again and again. ..so I took you for him by mistake. So now you can't make out the difference between an imbecile and me. Oh yes, you guys have got the apartment ..so who would be bigger imbecile than me. - You are getting me all wrong. Then what's the matter. You bastards, this apartment ownership is getting in your head. Actually I couldn't able to see your name and number properly.. ..on phone's screen Bhai, it wasn't my fault. Get an eye check up done if you can't see numbers. Lovely Bhai one minute. Please brother handle him. - Hey you talk to him. Where the hell are you Dhalla? Pick up the phone, Hello, hello. - Hello. He is right Bhai. Actually we were getting crank calls for sometime. ..so he got confused and thought this call must have been from the same guy. Ok 0k... listen to me. One of my 'PIECE' (Hooker) is coming to meet me... ..ask her to wait for me. Do offer her tea. - Yes Bhai. I am on my way, will be reaching any minute now. OK BhaL ne. And listen tell that bugger friend of yours not to drool over her, got it? OK Bhai, I Will 'tell him. Or I will cancel his partnership in the restaurant. OK Bhai, I Will 'tell him.

See Mr. Bhalla and Dha | | a.. ..no work is big or small. Work is work. Good thinking. Very good thinking. By the way what do you guys do for a living? We are... - Nothing special. Actually we are working on a new business plan these days. Yes. Right, right. Hey get me some lemon soda. Fried breakfast has taken a toll on my digestion. Yes Bhai. What is all this? Are you blind? Can't you see these are sarees. But why are you carrying so many sarees with you? I sell them. So this is your side business. - No, no, this is my main business. Okay, okay, this is very good. It means... When will Lovely Bhai come? - He'll reach any minute now. By the way considering your age you should not be interested in 'brothers'.

Hey where are you going? Let me help her find way to the washroom. Lovely Bhai, when did I get married? I had to say that for your own safety. My wife suspects this deal to be fake.. ..so she had hired a detective to investigate. ..and the detective is keeping a watch on us from outside. Detective? - Who is it? There is one bloody bastard. You guys do one thing, pick all this stuff and go out. ..and you two go out and take a walk have some tea and refreshments. ...meanwhile I'll get done with this saree girl. Jugnu where is my lemon soda? Lovely Bhai, are you seriously finding her attractive? I mean what's wrong with you taste? - What do you mean? I mean she was herself telling me that she works three shifts a day. Bhai, a man like you deserves new piece, you deserve a hot virgin chick. But pinto was telling me that she is new to all this.. ...and it's her first day. Oh Jugnu, a baker will always say that his bread is fresh.. ..so will the pimp about his. But pinto.. - Oh he is lying. He is making a fool of you. Ok let me help you with some numbers of pimps. They'll provide you with some hotties. Hey Jugnu. -Yes Bhai. Open the door. - Yes Bhai. Yes? ls this Lovely Bhai Khanna's residence? Yes it is. Tell me. Mr. Pinto has sent me. Yes he lives here, please come in. Thank you. Who is Lovely Bhai among of you? You? One minute one minute. Where are you going? You have knocked on the correct address. And hey what is this? I never knew that you also take service from Pinto. No, no, no, no Bhai. -Then what? Actually her face resembles a friend of mine.. ..so I thought she is the same. - Okay. Isn't it Gagan? - Yes. But it's not her right? - Yes Bhai. Now everything is crystal clear. No confusion left. She is sales girl and not your PIECE (hooker). So I think we should let her go and you can make this one stay instead. No, no, no, no way. lam not going to let her go. You were telling me lot about her colourful past sometime back. Errr... I was saying that because... Yes Bhai, he is right. She is not this kinda girl. Well, okay. Come on, sit here. Now you guys leave with your stuff. Leave immediately. - Lovely Bhai, just listen to... Hey get me a lemon soda. - Yes Bhai. Here is another quote.. "Lovers have only one business.." "..to love and to leave, to love and to leave" WOW! Hang on guys, hang on. -What happened? Why was this sales girl asking for Lovely Bhai? What? Was she asking about me? Yes. - Then she is also here for me. If pinto sent this girl then whose that sales girl? Open it up, let's check her bag. Hey what are you doing guys? It's ladies purse, bad manners. One minute Lovely Bhai please. Come on... check it. Take everything out. Lalwani brothers and associates. Investigation officer. Rosy D'costa. I've taken everything in my stride with my acting skills. ...full realistic acting. You don't worry. But sir, isn't it possible that Mr. Bad | ani's daughter.. ..has secretly married with Mr. Bha | | a.. ..and she is also involved in this fraud, isn't it sir? Rosy, Rosy, Rosy. - Yes sir. Had it been the case. ..then there was no need for Bhalla to get into so much trouble. ..this flat issue would not have been there. Bhalla wouldn't make all this nuisance. You have a point sir. So now just concentrate on this point. Ok sir, ok sir, sir one more thing. Hey what the hell is going on? Who is she? Bhai, she is not your piece, this one is. Then who is she? - Detective Detective? - Yes. But why have you called this detective here? No no... we haven't called her. She has been sent by Pooja's dad. I don't think so... rather I think she is working for Neelam bhabi. Don't you remember, Lovely Bhai was telling.. ..that Neelam bhabi has hired a detective to investigate. But why was she mentioning Bad | ani's name? Isn't it possible that Badlani and Neelam bhabi are going around? Hey whats cooking between you guys? Tell me clearly. Be specific. Actually Bhai, specific thing is that Badlani is suspecting us.. ..and the girl inside washroom is sent by him to investigate. Oh gosh, Bhai, you made me trapped. ..because you've called me a married man in front of her. That's okay. No big deal. Marriage is in itself a trap only. ..weather its after or before. Hey she is back. - Come on come on come on. This girl is big problem now. Neither ask her to go immediately nor welcome her. Hey are you in your bedroom... sit properly. Don't make such kind of face. Hey lets put everything back in her back. Put it back, put it back. Put it back, Open it. - Now how much should I open? Lovely Bhai, you don't put your nose. - Do it fast, open it. Do it fast, open it, do it fast, put it, it's done, leave now. Yourself? She is... No, no, let me guess. Let me guess. Mrs... Mrs... Mrs. Pawan Bhalla? No I am Rani... and Mr. pinto has sent me. Mr. Pinto? Pinto is lovely Bhai's brother in law. Meet Mrs. Lovely Khanna. Actually she got mad at Lovely Bhai and left to other's place out of anger. So her brother Mr. pinto intervened and asked her to cool down. ..and dart a fresh. lam sorry Lovely Bhai. - I am too sorry Lovely Bhai. lam sorry Lovely Bhai. - It's okay. It's okay. I had to hide it from you that she is coming back today. But this is your flat right? Of course it is mine. No doubt about that. Actually since Mrs. lovely left him.. ..so Lovely Bhai was feeling lonely at his place. ..so he decide to come and stay with me. Don't you want to buy her a saree? It'll make her happy. Of course, of course, why not? But first we want her to make some tea for all of us. Sister in law, it's been so long we hadn't had tea of your hands. Please make some tea for us.

I don't want my decent neighbour to come knocking at my door as a customer. How much money will I get? Whatever you charge per night we'll give a bit a more then that. I charge on hourly bases, not on day night bases, got it? Shut your mouth if you want Rosy in your life. Hello! - Who is this? Hey this is my phone. Hello, baby. Who picked the phone? Where are you?

Yes, tell me one thing.. ..why did you let this Chintan fellow come inside.. ..haven't I warned you against it? Oh Bhai, this Chintan rings the door bell and then just evaporates. He barged in this time because he wanted to boil the milk. But why was he consoling me and saying me very sad-very sad.. ..everything will be all right. What have you guys told him? He was asking about your where abouts Bhai. So Gagan lied to him that you have gone for your brother in law's funeral. Chintan is a big fool. OK dude, come on now. You also wear your goggles and leave. Yes please leave now. - Come on come on move out of here. Hey stop it. He is the one you've lied about, my brother in law. And tell me where is she? Who? The one for whom I bought a saree.. ...well it's time for her to pay back for that favour. Bhai, we have no idea regarding her where abouts. Then why were you asking for her address? We wanted it for you Lovely Bhai. Oh really? For me? Yes. We went to take your money back from her. Yes, yes. So? We asked her to either pay back the money or give the saree. And then?
