Well, neither is the salad and that's your department. -Yeah, you said. -No. -You did. Yes, you did. -God! You look good. Really? Hey, wait. Now, you know what the doctor said. -I do? -Yes. No fooling around when it's high risk. We have to keep everything very still. Yes. So, it's only a problem if you come. Right? Doctor's orders. Nate, the salad, please. I beg. -Hey! -What? Pushing that pouch out. Am not. Are too. Salad? Look at you! You're barely showing, but you got the glow! -You think? -Absolutely. You are just radiating "mom." Emily? -Hi, Risa. -Hello. Hi. This is Brittany, my best friend. Risa's Nate's new art dealer. Pleased to meet you. Maybe I should put some shoes on. Not on my account, honey. These potatoes are fucking awesome. Yeah, they're fucking awesome. Nate did those. I said they'd be better with bacon, but he's one of them vegetarians. -That's right. -Bacon. I wish you'd lay off that bacon, girl. Everything's better with bacon. It's God's gift to mankind. -You gotta love the pig. -Hurl. What about the baby? You're gonna raise it vegetarian or not? I think what you mean is, "Whose side is she gonna be on?" It's a little girl! We just found out. I'm gonna start buying pink things, immediately. -I'm not gonna be able to help myself. -No pink. We have a rule. -But to answer your question. -Yeah? She's gonna be raised as an omnivore. -Right. -Like her mother. Until she turns 16, rebels against her mother, and starts running around the house with her pants off screaming, "Meat is murder!" He's already turning you against me. All right. A little toast. To baby girls and bacon. -I had to add that. -Look me in my eye... I don't feel very good. So, Emily, tell me about your clothing designs. Where would I have seen them? Well, with the baby, things have been busy so, I've stopped for now. -She does beautiful work. -Yes, she does. I own, like, five of her dresses. -Yes. -I'm wearing one tonight. Excuse me, I have to go throw up. Morning sickness. Comes noon and night, too. That's another reason not to get pregnant. I don't think you're going to get pregnant any time soon. What was that? Emily? Nate! Nate! Nate! There's scarring. I'll never be able to... Mrs. Weaver, so glad you decided to come take a look. Call me Emily. Well, the Weavers built this house in 1813. Although, over the years, improvements have been made, the original foundation is still here. Stayed in your family, the Weavers, until 1910. Well... I'm gonna wait out here, if you don't mind. It's a little motel-esque, but it's not bad. Well... So, what do you think? It's pretty. It's very green. It's really isolated. We could get lonely. No, we could have people out here. Impress them with our homemade jams. That's the spirit. I saw a building out there. I can use it for my studio. I think I could be happy here. Where do you want the table? By this wall. You know what, I'm sorry, maybe over there. Perfect. Thank you. -I'll take care of that. -Okay. There's a few more like this in the van. -All right. -Thanks. Mic check. Mic check. Microphone check. One, two. One, two. Mission, this is ground control. We got an APB for Emily Weaver. Come back. You're such a dork. It works. That's amazing. Where are you? Bedroom. Well, my studio is perfect. Get out here. Ten-four, good buddy. I'll be right down. Hey, how's it looking? Great! But it's upside down. It is perfect, isn't it? It's great. It's really great. We have to keep an eye on those guys. They're hanging your paintings upside down. Well, we'll hang 'em right side up. Do you know where the black one is? No. Look at this. Look at all this. Look at those fields. Look at that house. That house is ours. I'm ready for a country life. Really? Are you? -Hey. -Hey. What... Are you... I thought I might start back up again and just see how it goes. Unless you wanted to use the room for something else. No. Are you kidding me? I think it's great. It's wonderful. The glass is loose. Okay. We'll put it on the list. Where does this go? We haven't looked at that since our last move. -Basement time. -No. I'll go through it. To the basement. Nate! Don't do that. Sorry. -You okay? -I'm fine. -You sure? You don't look okay. -I'm fine! It's their wedding announcement. "William Nathaniel Weaver and Mary Elizabeth Perkins-Weaver. "February 2, 1846." They have the same anniversary we do. Hey, this thing has a false bottom. Give me a hand. Maybe we can get it out. My inheritance might be in here. What is it? I think they're daguerreotypes. It's like this has gotta be them, don't you think? -William and Mary Weaver. -Yeah. I think he was my great, great, great, great... He was born a long time ago but he was my uncle. He kind of looks like you. Come on. Guy looks like he's got a stick all the way up his ass. No, l... Well, he looks like you with a stick up your ass. You are so sweet to me. Look at that. Didn't these pictures take forever? She was probably standing there for about five minutes. I think she was cold. You look good in there. You bought a tree. Wanted to bring some new life here. I understand. Looks good. You know, we never decided on a name. I always liked Ruth. So did l. Are you still happy about all this? Yeah, I am. I like the quiet. I was thinking I don't even think I'm gonna miss the public library or afternoons at the MoMA. Well, that's good 'cause I got your MoMA right here, baby. Stop. You think we should? Yeah, I do. Do you? I'm a little scared that I'm, you know, damaged. You're perfect. Wait. Come here. What? I love you. Are you okay? I'm okay. Are you sure? Yeah. Damn. Nate! Tree's attacking your pipes. See, tree roots are drawn to water, and old pipes like these aren't watertight. Roots just bust 'em right open. See? Don't worry. We'll get you clear and running again. It's like they say, "A flush is better than a full house." Sorry, plumber joke. -So, how much is this gonna cost us? -You see right there? The pipes are gone. What was that? -I don't know. -Get back there. See all that corrosion? Odds are, whoever did this is long gone. I wouldn't worry about 'em coming back. Odds? You're not sure? Well, we won't know for sure till we send them out for forensic testing. Who could it be? It's hard to say. There might be a missing persons report in the archive, but I wouldn't bet on it. Emily, great to see you. -You too. Come on in. -ls Nate ready? Almost. Thanks for picking him up. No problem. We have a lot to go over on the way down. There you are. -Hello. -Hi. All right, shall we go? -I'm ready when you are. -Okay. Last chance to change your mind. No, you have fun checking out galleries. Go get 'em. -Love you. -I love you too. Bye, Emily. Bye. Hello? Hello! Hello? Hello? -Sorry. -No. No, it's okay. I didn't hear you come in. I don't get many visitors. So, how can I help you? Well, l... My name's Emily. Emily Weaver. And my husband and l, -we just moved... -You're the one who found the skeleton. News travels fast. Sure it does. Small town. Right. So... Sorry. Here. -Coffee? -Sure. Thank you. Good. So, I bet you're anxious to find out who was buried under your house. Exactly. Me too. I have to confess, your house has always fascinated me. Tell me, are you a "Weaver" Weaver? Are you related to the Weavers who built the house? Yes. Actually, my husband is, but... What do you know about my house? It has a dark history. There's just so much. For example? Well, in 1827, Jeremiah Weaver shot himself, Mary Weaver disappeared in the mid-1800s. I think we found some of her things, in my basement. -Really? -Really. I'd love to see those. So then, fast forward to the turn of the century. The notorious H. H. Holmes stayed in the general area. I... The World's Fair killer. He confessed to killing 27 people. Only nine bodies were ever found, though. But he was in my house? Well, we can't prove that he wasn't. Then in 1921, Ezra Thayer was. He murdered his wife, Colette. And you're saying all of this happened in my house? But don't worry. Nothing bad has happened there since 1960s. It was a school then, you know. The headmistress fell, or was pushed, from a second-story window to her death. So, according to your research, that body could have come from anywhere from four to five of horrible deaths on the property? No, no. No, I'm sure there are more. And when we get a date on those bones, then we can start to figure something out. It won't be a mystery for long. Hello? Nate? Generally, when people faint, we only explore the hauntings angle after we've removed some other options. I know it's not real. I know it was a dream. -lt just seemed very real. -Mrs. Weaver, everyone in this town knows that last week you found a body underneath your house. If that is not a good reason to have a nightmare, I don't know what is. I don't think you fainted at all. What I think you experienced was a simple case of sleepwalking. It can often be accompanied by vivid dreams. Did you sleepwalk as a child? No. Well, when we see it in adults, it's usually in reaction to stress. How've you been? Since the miscarriage? How's the depression? Well, l... I mean, the meds help. It's just... My husband, Nate, he brought us out here so I would get better. So we could forget, you know, it's... I thought it was a good idea to leave the city, but I'm not sure if it is. Listen, it could be many things. Let's run some tests, and get some answers. Okay. No. What's wrong? It's sick. Yeah. No. Look, I gotta call you back, all right? You okay? I don't like sleeping alone. You work late last night? Yeah. And it's about to get real busy out here. I just set the date for my show. Good. Where? Risa wants to go with the gallery on Bleecker Street. I like that one. Anybody call for me? No. Wait a second, yeah. The sheriff called. They've identified the bones at the lab. They're about 150 years old and they belong to an adult female. Really? So now what? I don't know. That's it. Case closed. But 150 years old. That's when William and Mary lived here. Mary disappeared. It could be her. Yeah. That's a possibility. Did you tell the sheriff? No. Nate! What's he gonna do? Go and arrest a guy? That's probably Risa. Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Weaver. Click over if she beeps in. Hi. You're sure? But... Okay. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Who was that? That was the doctor. He said the reason for all the stress, and the nightmares and the sleepwalking is because I'm pregnant. You don't seem happy. Of course I am. You don't look like it. No, no. It's just so unexpected. It's a lot to take in. But I thought that you couldn't. I guess they were wrong. Nate, I'm pregnant. Honey, it's great. Really. What... Nate? Nate? Nate? Nate. What's up? Have you been in the house the whole time? Yeah. I was downstairs. Who... Who what? Nothing. I... Are you coming to bed soon? Yeah. Yeah, just give me a few minutes to finish up. Okay, hurry. I really want you with me. Nate, are you almost done? Are you coming soon? Nate? I brought you coffee. You okay? I tried buzzing you last night. I can't see it? Not yet. It's something different I'm experimenting with. It's a... It's a surprise. Okay. You want some breakfast? I'll just scrounge something up before I crash. We have our doctor's appointment today at 3:.00. Can you handle that? Handle it? I've gotta work. I mean, there is a baby on the way. -Yeah, Nate, I'd really like you there. -It's just routine, right? It's routine. So, there's a problem, you just call me. Hey. How was your appointment? It was fine. I should've gone with you. I'm sorry. I am happy, you know? Are you? Of course I am. Did he have any idea how it happened? I guess there wasn't as much scarring as they thought, and apparently I have a very regenerative uterus. That's interesting. Super uterus. We should give it a cape and a mask. This is real, Nate. I know. I know. So, what else did the doctor say? It's a high-risk pregnancy. He wants me on partial bed rest, he wants me to stay off my feet, avoid travel, -avoid stress. -All right. Okay. That's doable. It's gonna be hard on you. You're gonna have to do a lot of everything. I'll take care of it. I promise. All you have to do is rest. Your wish is my command. Hey, I just got an e-mail from Filipe. He was wondering if there's anything he should bring to our party. Nate, you try staying in bed all the time. It's very boring. Lonely. Okay, well, you have to cancel that. I only have three weeks till my show, and there's no way you can get this house ready for a party. Brittany's coming a day early. You don't have to do anything. Like I would ask you to. Wait. What's that supposed to mean? I can't stand being alone in this house. I need my friends around. What you need is to take care of yourself. You have another chance, Emily. Don't ruin it. Me? We have been given another chance. Us. -Hi. -Oh, my God! -You look wonderful. -I'm so glad... -Great house. -Thank you. I'm glad you guys made it. -Love the dress. -Thanks. Are you designing again? Not really. -Looks like it. -Anyway, I'm gonna mingle. Thank you. -Hi. -Hey. -How are you? -Good to see you. -You too. -Looking good. Thank you. He's fine. He's single. -Really? -Yeah. -He's mine. -Go get him. Emily, the house is amazing. Thanks. Well, we have a lot to do to really make it us still. Where's Nate? In the studio. He's really focused on the show. I gotta take a look at that. Well, he's a little bit private about it right now. I haven't even seen it. He's not letting me. -Well, there he is. -Hey. Nate. -Hi. -Hey. -Never thought you'd get out of there. -I know. I'm sorry. -How's it going? -Good. So, you're gonna show me the new work, right? Maybe. I mean, have you seen the rest of the house yet? -No, not yet. -Okay. Well, I'll give you the two-cent tour. Lauren and Scott are in the other room. All right. Just take a little while. -Okay. -Okay? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. -Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. If you need to get that cleaned, -I know the perfect place for it. -Stop. I'll take care of it. -Are you sure? -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm so sorry. Mrs. Weaver. Mrs. Weaver. The house looks lovely. -Thank you. -And I brought you some materials. I found some more material. I'm so sorry. I have to... I spilled. Of course, of course, of course. And I did and I found it... Wow. Look at this. 1875 and... Something wrong? Wine. I spilt wine on my dress. I have to change. That's too bad. It's so pretty. Can l? I've just always wanted to see your designs. -Yeah. -Thanks. I was actually gonna ask you something. What were you thinking when you helped her plan all this? We both want her to be happy, Nate. That's all this was about. Yeah? Yeah. She's a little fragile right now. She's always fragile! Nate. I'm sorry. I'm just going through a really... We've got her stabilized now. Mr. Weaver, I'm gonna need statements from you and your wife. Please. We can just come down tomorrow. Of course. Good night, sir. You okay? Yeah. I wish we had fixed that window. Emily, there's something you're not telling me. I just... Never mind. No, no, no. Come on. It's me. Sometimes I think I see things. Ghosts. I know it's my imagination. I mean, I know that. I don't want you to think that I don't know that. What? It's probably what? Stress? Yeah, stress. Probably. Or maybe you did see something. When you're pregnant, you're really sensitive, and you pick up things like a radio antenna, like all sorts of signals. -Right. -Yeah. What if the baby can feel my thoughts? What if it knows that I think it's gonna die? No, no, sweetie. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay, all right? Why don't you go get some rest? I've got to get back to the city. Call me later. Okay. Okay. Nate? It was supposed to be a surprise. Look, you need your rest. Will you please go back to bed? Okay? Are you going to try it or not? It's good. I got it on the first shot. If you wanted to eat rabbit, you could have bought it in town. In town? We live off the land. We? I'm not the one who shot it. You're a hypocrite. You eat meat all the time. What is it that you think they do in slaughter houses? You gotta kill them somehow. I didn't just blast its brains across the backyard. It's a beautiful night. I'm gonna throw up. It's not the meat. That's it, blame the child. Nate! I saw her! -She was right there on the couch! -Okay, okay. Mary Weaver was right there! You had a nightmare. You dreamed about her before. She was on the couch! Look, you need to go and lay down, okay? I need to get back to work! We have to go! We can't stay here. -Of course we can! -We can't. Please! Look, this is just... It's just your hormones reacting. Don't dismiss me like that! Please. You're getting worked up for no reason at all, okay? Go back in and lay down, all right? I have to go back to work. I have to work! What you do is your business. Fuck you. No, no. No. Hey, honey, are you okay? I'm so sorry. I didn't mean... Earlier, I... I should never have gotten that upset. What I said before, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Thank you. So, can you feel it yet? Feel what? The baby. Can you feel it move yet? I would never hurt you, Mary. What are you talking about? Who you talking to? What are you doing here? I thought you were in the guest house. Yeah, well. I'm not. -I have to go down to the city. -Now? Yeah, now! Risa is dead. -When? -I don't know. I just got the word. And her fucking assistant Timothy's handling the show, and he's a fucking idiot. I'm so sorry. -When are you coming back? -I don't know. Maybe today, maybe two. And I don't need all these questions from you right now. I really don't. But, Nate, I can't take care of myself. I need help and l... Really? Is it really that hard? I mean, you can lie down, you can walk to the bathroom, you can get a glass of water, get some food, right? Maybe? Good. You're not helpless. I'll be back in a couple days. What would you like today, peppermint or chamomile? Shit! What do you want? Mary Weaver. Michelle Williams, in the 1950s, vanished. In 1921, Ezra Thayer murdered his wife, Colette. The headmistress fell from the second-story window to her death. It's Emily. Nate left me here, and there's all these things going on, and I don't know what to do. Slow down. Where's Nate? He went to the city for a couple of days, but after he left... He's here in New York? Yeah, but I found Mary Weaver's journal, and all the dates match. And the journal has everything. The day they moved in is the day we moved in. William Weaver went away on the same day. They found out they were pregnant on the same day. -They all died on the same day. -Who died? All of them. All the women who got pregnant in this house. It's the house. It changes people. It's changing Nate. He's different now. It's a cycle and it keeps repeating. Emily, just wait for me. I'm on my way. But all the wives who got pregnant, their husbands killed them, and if Nate comes back, he's gonna kill me. I tried to leave and it wouldn't let me. I tried and it hurt so much. -Honey? -I'm scared. Honey, I need you to listen, okay? Okay. Okay. Are you hurt? No. Good. I want you to go in the living room and wait for me. -Okay. -Just stay there. -Okay. Okay. -And I'll be there in a couple of hours. But what if Nate comes back? He won't. You said he left for a few days, right? Wait for me. I'm coming to get you. Okay. I'll be right here. Gun. Gun. Mary, come here! Mary? Mary? Hello? Please, my name is Emily Weaver. I'm at 342... Hello? Emily? Mary. Mary. Mary. Get away from me! Mary, come here! Mary, don't move! I'm not Mary! You're coming inside! No! Baby?
