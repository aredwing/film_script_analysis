You can see the golden sunrise from over here.. WWWo So beautiful. She looks so homely. I like her a lot too. You can give your life just to get a girl. Idiots! You don't have to give your life for her. Just get her anklet. What? Same dream again? Why do you keep thinking about it? Some stranger decided to jump in, and died. We don't even know why he jumped in. Do you know him? Or did you ask him to jump? Just let it go. At least he only jumped once. You stress yourself thinking about it everyday. If you get tensed up for small things like this,.. ..you will only ruin your studies, do you understand? Shruti?! -I'm coming. I am leaving now. Don't just sit there. It's late. Quickly get ready and leave. Geeta! Do not be late. That's him! Hit him. Who do you think you are messing with? Hey! Let's go. So much happened, and he is still teaching. Hey, who is she? Her name is Geeta. Very homely girl. Her mother is a teacher, very strict upbringing. Many people in our college have tried, but to no success. Even if you tried, it will be a waste. What I meant was, you can give it a try. She will definitely fall for your personality. Hey, bring the bike over. They bumped into each other! -Their books must have fallen? Yes, it has fallen down. - Now, he will apologise to her. Sorry! He has apologised to her! Now he will pick her books up. - Yes, but is leaving. He won't. After two steps, he will turn around in slow motion. It's happening just as you said. How did you know? How many times have I watched this scene in the movies? If he bumped into her today, he will stand up for her to others. Hey! - Arjun! Let him go. He didn't know she was your girl. It's a misunderstanding. Please go.We are sorry. Hey! - Sit down, brother! Please. Don't you know who he is? He is MP Devanayagan's son. Whatever he say's will take place in this college. Excuse me! Excuse me! Why did you hit him? He disturbed me. Why should it bother you? Who are you? Why are you getting involved in my problems unnecessarily? You bumped into me yesterday. You fought for me today. Tomorrow, you will invite me to a restaurant. These kind of cheap tactics won't work with me. I don't like it. -Yes, you're right. We shall meet in a restaurant tomorrow. You will come. Hello? -9 o'clock. What? - Coffee date. Excuse me? Why didn't you come yesterday? -Why should I? I love you. I am in love with you. You must love me in return. It should happen in the next ..I will jump from the college rooftop. Shruti, do you think he will really jump? He will definitely jump. What makes you so sure? I know him. He will not listen to anyone. For you, he is capable of jumping. As it is, you are still upset for a stranger... ..who commited suicide for you. Assuming he also commits suicide for you.. ..you will never forgive yourself lifelong. Listen to me, don't think too hard. It's just ''I love you'', just say the words. Isn't there another way? - No. Is this all there is to love? Qkay dear, bye. Qkay dear, bye. It's your first day of college. Call me if you have a problem. Bye. Please Arjun, get down! Say it Geeta, please? Geeta come on, do something. I love you! Hi! - Bye, Arjun. Come on. Bye. Hey!What is this? Stones? Hey, who are you? - Your friend. Friend? What is your name? Quarter? Is there such a name? Who would use such a name? Qh Kutti? Sweet name! Kutti, when shall we meet? - Evening, in Mayajal. Competition is tough this time, but definitely we will win! Sorry brother! I'm having practical now, otherwise.. .. I'd follow you to the airport. - It's okay. Hello? Hey! No, I am going to Delhi. Leaving now. Party? You always want a party. Ok, cool, after I come back. Nothing. I love you. Hello? I love you. Hey!Wait!Who is he? Do you know him? How dare he declare his love to you in front of me?! Hey! Stop! Do you know him? Who is he? Hey, come here fast! - Hey Arjun? You haven't left? Someone,just told Geeta he loves her, in front of me! Who? where? how? I must have all his details immediately! Let it go! I'll take care of it. You are late for your flight. I must know now! - Listen to me, let's go.Take him. Who is this new guy? Go and find out everything about him. ''I love you'' in front of me? Kutti? Friend, I am ready. Throw the stone. If any of this 3 stones fall in, my love will succeed. Qtherwise... - All the best! It's okay. Second try. Just missed. Friend, another shot. Last try. Let's cancel this game. We shall start over again. Again? Did he tell you when Arjun was by your side? Yes, I was so stunned. I didn't know what to do. Maybe he didn't know. - Didn't know? He did it on purpose. How does he look? Good looking? Why don't you introduce him to me? I'm bored. Can you be quiet? He had better not appear in front of me again. Hi, I am fine. - Qh my god! I love you. Is this a joke? - No, I am very serious. Do you know who was by my side yesterday? I know! Arjun. You love him. And I love you. So simple. So you are doing all this on purpose? Just because you love him, doesn't mean I can't love you... ..that's not love, right? - Right, Kutti. Why me? That's not important.What is in the heart is more important. What are you trying to say? I am not asking you to love me. Just feel my love. Just be happy someone loves you. - I don't like all this. And I hate you. Where is he? - He must have gotten into trouble. Success! Do you know what Geeta told me? What did Geeta tell you? Geeta saw me... - She saw you? ..and said she hates me. -What? It means she does not like you. I know. But at least hate is better than no emotions, right? You must be in her heart for her to love or hate you. So it means, I am in her heart. - He has ruined everything. My dearest Geeta.. ..you are the reason I have become what I am today. You crept into my unsuspecting heart.. ..and made me present a rose to you that first time. Now you made me write this letter. I wonder what else will you make me do? Now and then, try to feel the love I have for you. Please be wary of the friends around you... Signed, Kutti. - Qkay, let's get serious. Tomorrow morning, we shall give Kutti a warning, okay? What? Arrogance? You think there is no one to question you? If you see a pretty girl, you just can't resist giving her a letter? Of course! Or did you think we would give you instead? Do you think your love alone is enough? Doesn't she need to feel the same way? No Shruti, you don't understand. If I love you, and ask for your love in return, it's business not love. If your love is true... - Excuse me, love itself is true. There is no true or untrue love. Your question itself is wrong. Next? You say you are in love. Its personal.Why do you express it and not keep it to yourself? Tell me again? You said it was within your right to love Geeta, without her love.. Tthen why express it instead of keeping it to yourself? I could not contain my love for Geeta, it just overflowed. I am very expressive. I express my feelings openly. Why do you love Geeta knowing Arjun already loves her? Do you like Shah Rukh Khan? - I like him a lot. Do you like him? - I like him too. I'm sorry. She likes him, hence, you should not like him. Are you clapping for me? Thank you. Have you loved anyone before? - No. You have no right to ask questions. Please sit. Girls, any other questions? - No. Stop wasting time with these questions. Fall in love.. .And there won't be doubts, okay? - Okay. Shruti, this is only for you. Take it. Bye. Hey, he gave Shruti a letter! - Read it aloud, Shruti! To my unbeloved Shruti, From the first day I met you, I begin to dislike you.. You are the true meaning of the word hate, Every moment I do not see you, I am at peace. Please do not accidently come to Spencer Plaze this evening. ...Signed with true hatred, Kutti. Idiot! Hi! Did you feel my love? Didn't you feel it just a little bit? Geeta! Out! Did he send you out? - Are you happy? What do you want? I just wanted to know if you felt my love? No! - Not even a little? No! How can you be so unfeeling? Has love become so cheap? Look here, you are so.. - Smart? Each time I see you... - See me? I get so angry!What do you think of yourself? Cockroach! You are frightened of a non-existent cockroach. So, why can't you feel my love which is real? I feel the same for the cockroach and you. I hate you! So, you enjoy hating me? - I enjoy it a lot. So why do you say it with an angry face? Say it with a smile. I hate you. - But I love you. I can't stand his lecture. What a torture! Do you think you can pass this time? Will you show me your answers this time? - I will try. Then I will definitely pass. - Shruti, Indraman is looking for you. You haven't submitted your notes? Go quickly. Qh dear, I forgot. I'll be back shortly. - Hurry up. Hi! How are you Geeta? Where are you going? Just have coffee with me. You need a break from studies once awhile. You can continue hating me over coffee... Qr if you are afraid you might feel something else..it's okay, bye. Geeta! -Hi! Don't disturb her. She is hating me. You carry on. Did you just laugh? -No! I did not! You did. I saw you laugh. -Yes, I laughed. So what? So are you beginning to feel my love? What are you babbling about? My mistake for having coffee with you. You hate me.Why not do it wholeheartedly? Why laugh? Qkay, please pay for this coffee. I am leaving now. Were you born, and made? Why are you torturing me? There are so many girls around. Why did you choose me to love? Why do I love her not you? Do you have any issues? Are you mad? Hello! Why do I love her not you? Do you have any issues? What? Hello! Why do I love her not you? Do you have any issues? I asked everyone, but no response. You have to feel my love. If you do feel it, I will surely come in your dream at night. Geeta! Geeta! Hi! Hi! -Hi! What was his name? -Kutti! Kutti. New admission. An orphan. Has an apartment in Ashok Nagar. He's so outrageous. Arjun, all the girls are after him. Quick as lightning and a sweet talker. When he speaks, it makes sense. If you think back, you will get confused. -Yes, he's strong. Get's what he wants. We tried to fight him. He didn't hurt us, but broke everything else. Even then, I think he said something.. -Try to recall when you're alone! We should be cautious. He is after Geeta. If we don't do something, you might lose her. Hey!Where is Kutti? Where is he? Boss! I am here. Yes boss, where have you been? The last I saw you was when I proposed to Geeta. Didn't I tell you he was strong? -Is this what you came for? I'm Arjun! You must have heard about me? You're new. Don't let me see you near Geeta again. I'll kill you. Boss! Just a minute.We can fight, but before that, I'm curious. Do you love Geeta? -Wait! wait. Hey, He loves Geeta. That's why we are backing him up. Does Geeta love you in return? -Wait! wait. Silly question! Didn't you hear her scream her love for him that day? Qkay, so it's settled then. -Hey, wait! Come back! Look, don't anger me. You had better erase Geeta from your heart. No, I won't agree to this. Did I ask why you love her? Same way, you should not ask me why I love her. Its personal. I can love anyone I choose. Why are you so worried? Afraid I'll win her? Don't you trust your love? Is your love that weak? You seem to have many doubts. Qkay, If you admit you don't trust your love.. ..I promise to leave Geeta this instance. Hey! Arjun trusts his love. Qkay Boss, if your love is strong... ..no one including me can come in between both of you. But if it was weak, not just me, even he could come in between. How can you call a love that is not love, true love? Didn't I warn you? Why did you bring these sticks with you? To play? Look, if you decide to hit me, it means you don't trust your love. Admit you don't trust your love, I'll leave this college now. Why do keep saying you will leave this college? Stop saying that. You shall remain here. You carry on loving. What are you saying? -Why are you worried? Trust me! Hey, you stay here. Let's see what you can do. Arjun has faith his love is strong. Qkay. So you should be able to accept anything I do good naturedly. But, if you decide to hit me.. -Why are you repeating it again? Do whatever you want. We will not get angry. You can't do anything! Do you know where Arjun stands? He is the king of this college. Ignore him, he is insignificant. Don't you trust me? Let's go. Arjun! -What? Are you going to the library? Yes, why do you care? -Hey, shut up. Tell Geeta, I will meet her this evening. -Arjun, I'll handle him. Leave him. I repeat, Arjun has faith in his love. -Okay, go. Hello? Yes? I am coming now. Krishna! Krishna! -Arjun called you. Shruti just called me. Geeta is unwell. Let's go and visit her. Yes, let's go. Can't tolerate his lecture. You wait here, I'll go and see her. -Go, but give us money first. Boss! Was he born, or handmade? Boss, did you hear? Geeta is unwell. Let's go visit her. Why boss? You have no faith? -Confidence! Why boss? You want to buy fruits for Geeta? Why such formalities between us? Will Geeta love you only if you buy her all this? I didn't know there were so many problems in your love life. Brother, give us a dozen apples. -No! Not necessary. Apples cancelled. Hey Geeta, your lovers are here. Kutti! Kutti! Kutti has won! Hi Geeta! -Hi! What happened to you? Look, she looks so weak. I am here now, so don't worry. You rest for few days. I will collect your lecture notes. Why do you keep standing when you're not well? Here, sit. Did I overdo it? -No! I didn't. So sit down. Call yourself lovers. Didn't it occur to you to buy her fruits at least? I bought fruits, Shruti! This is a competition boss! -Are you trying to cheat? What is there to cheat in this? wanted to buy fruits. You can't blame me, for you not buying fruits. Don't you have brains to think? I can't be telling you what to do. Come on girls, let's go outside. Give them some privacy. Useless girl, don't keep it to yourself. Give some to Geeta. You think I have nothing better to do? Are you happy now? This is all because of you. If you had warned him in the beginning... ..things wouldn't have come this far. Having coffee with him, talking to him.. ..you could have avoided all this, right? I can't even do anything. If I try to do something... ..he tortures me by saying I don't trust my love. It is driving me crazy. He makes a fool of me everyday! Why do you need his friendship? You had better avoid him. Don't irritate me. Ready! This time, it's serious. My love will succeed, if either one of these stones falls in. Wait! One minute, I'll be right back. Kutti!Wait! This spot, perfect! Qkay, let's have it this way. -How? Either way, you are not going to drop the stone into the cup. Now, if the stone falls outside the cup, you love will succeed. This sounds even better. Hurray! The stone fell in the cup! Qh dear, it fell into the cup. Why are you staring at me? Kutti, don't. I am your friend. Let me go, everyone is looking. Let me go. Don't hit me. What am I supposed to do? You want it to fall in, it doesn't. You don't want it to fall in, it does. Friend, love is the same. When you want it, you won't have it. When you don't expect it, you will get it. Really? -Yes. You could have just hit me. I'm sorry friend. Qkay, let's watch a movie. -Let's eat first. Stop! When Arjun is not around, I am your boss. What are you staring at? She is mine. Catch it! My girl! Can't you see? Idiot! In a student's life, this is normal. It happens. Today is Geeta, my lovers birthday. Please wish her, signed. Kutti. So sweet. How long must we wait. Hurry up and cut the cake. Who knows where he is now? -If kept long, the cake will spoil. By the time you cut, it will be your next birthday. Are you going to cut? Qr shall I cut? Hey what happen? There's no electricity. Happy birthday to you. -Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Geeta, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday! Wow, nice gift! -What an excellent idea. Superb.Wow! -Look! Nice gift. Thanks! -Yes! Cut the cake. -Take the knife, and cut. What happened brother? How did the birthday party go? Arjun, sit down. -You, come here. What happened? -What do you think happened? Why didn't you come for the birthday party? Do you know how long I waited for you? Why? As if your party was ruined because I didn't come? Those closest to you were there with a gift. Closest to me? Oh, you meant Kutti? It is not what you think. Look, this is his gift. What is this? He has given your photo to win over your girl? He has done the complete opposite? We should not underestimate him. You didn't expect this right? Now tell me, is he good or bad? If he really wants to break us up, why give me such a gift? Arjun, stop suspecting him unnecessarily. He likes me. He just wants to be friendly. That's all. Nothing else. Really. He is a very nice guy. Yes, I am really a very nice guy! What is he doing? Today, your photo makes her happy, so I gave yours. Tomorrow, if my photo makes her happy, I'll give her mine. It's not about who's photo. It's what makes her happy. Didn't I tell you? Boss, do you smoke? It is bad for health. You must exercise, drink juice, and stay healthy. I like Geeta, and she likes you. So I like you too. So, you must take care of yourself. Bye! Why is he advising you? Arjun, I don't know how to handle him. I know what to do. Let's not resort to fighting. Let's be rational. We still have one week for that tender, don't we? Mani, please ask Muthu to come. We'll ask him to handle this. If Muthu can't resolve this, I'll decide what to do next. Qkay sir. Come Arjun, have you eaten? Why? You seem disturbed? What happened? Any problems in college? Mani! Ask Muthu to come quickly! There's a problem in college. Go check it out. Settle the tender issue as well. Geeta is really playing it safe. She already has a backup. Geeta, that was a smart move. Don't worry about anything.. ..just make sure you play it safe. How was the first stage? How did you feel? Hi! Why did you do that? Do you think I am a call girl? I am not that type of a girl! It's my mistake! For not avoiding you at the beginning. What do you think in your heart? That you can do as you please? You think no one will question you? There is a limit to everything. You have crossed your limit. The whole college thinks cheaply of me now. You have violated my self respect on that notice board. What wrong did I do to you? Now I understand you very well. You are psychotic! You will do anything to get me. That alone will never happen! There is no place in my heart for you. Ever. I don't know what happened until now. But listen to me carefully, I only love Arjun. No one forced me. I will prove to you that my love is true. The only problem I have in life is you. Only you. I hate you. I really hate you. I just hate you! I am your problem, you will be happier without me.. ..okay, I will leave you alone. I will never appear in your life again. I hate this hospital, signed, Kutti. Who is this guy? -Don't know, but interesting. This hospital has cured me of the pain caused by love. That's why I don't like this hospital. I hate this hospital. Hi, I am Malini. -Hi! So, when shall we meet? Hey Geeta, come on, let's dance. Hey, come on. -No, Arjun! No, Arjun! Arjun! No! Krishna! Arrange for a tour immediately. That's a great idea. If what should happen, takes place. ..she will automatically come after you. Since we are going, how about going somewhere cool, like Kashmir? It might be too expensive? Geeta is heading here. Hi. I heard you pushed Arjun yesterday? Yes, never trust the quiet girls. Why did he behave that way? -Why? What wrong did I do? Was it wrong that I tried to kiss you? Aren't you my lover? Are you really in love with me? I know. She does not love me. She is only pretending to love me. She is definitely going to make a fool of me one day. Why are you talking this way, Arjun? -How else should I talk? Stop fighting you two! You will make Kutti's words come true. Yes.We don't like you both fighting. That's why we have decided to organize a tour. Tour? Yes, to bring lovers closer. -Its the best way to bring couples close. Why suddenly? -This sudden plan is called a tour. I am not coming. Krishna, call the coach. -Why do you want to invite him? Tell the coach, I am not going to participate in the race this year. Arjun!Wait! -Geeta!This is all your fault. Why are you doing this? Don't you want Arjun to win? If he wins this, he will represent the state next, go and call him back! Go, go and call him. -Quickly go and call him. Arjun, why don't you want to participate in this race? Why don't you want to join the tour? What has the tour got to do with the race? Both are important to me. You want me to join the tour, right? Qkay, you win this race, and I willjoin the tour. Arjun! Arjun! Kutti! Kutti! Cancel the tour? Tour okay! And this year athletic champion is Kutti! Give him a big hand. You left saying you will never see Geeta again? That was....just.... -So, you are going to meet Geeta? I won't disturb Geeta. I don't want to cause any more problems. So, have you forgotten Geeta? Forget? Fool! Aren't you ashamed? Is this why you come to college? How dare you say 'I love you'? Mind your business! Why? Qne sided love? You should not fret! Qne sided love is a beautiful feeling by itself. When we love, it means, we give out love. The person we love, receives that love.We just have to wait. Those who have a heart, will give it. Those who don't have a heart, will accept it. That's all. Kutti! Your love will succeed! I am jumping for joy, why are you so silent? No, I didn't have anything in mind when I threw that stone. What? -I am sorry, friend. Do you know how happy I was? Why couldn't you have made a wish? It's okay. Next time, make a wish, and then throw the stone. Great idea! The great race champion, Kutti, is drenched in beer. Isn't there anyone here to feel for him? Hey, do feel for him? -No. How about you? -I feel the beer is wasted on him. He feels sorry he couldn't even taste a drop of beer. She feels for him. It's as if the whole college feels for him. How is that? If the stone falls in, your love will succeed? You may win the race, but not in love. You will always be one sided love, Kutti. Understood? Sir is very quiet? Silence doesn't suit you, Kutti. Say something, come on. No boss. I won't disturb you anymore. Why boss? Don't say that. If you don't disturb me, I will be very disturbed. Come on, say something. Boss, how many times has Geeta said she loves you? Qnly once. She has told me she hates me a 1 000 times. Which is bigger? 1 or 1 000? Boss, you have only made her feel one time. I have made her feel 1000 times. In that case, the feeling she has for me is stronger than yours. I have never seen a party like this before. -Take only one glass! Nice to meet you sir! -Hello. Your father seems to be in a nice mood. Tell him about Geeta and get his blessing. You never know what Kutti might do next. Don't delay. Go. Greetings. -Welcome!Welcome! Why the formalities? -You are used to accepting favors. You seem to have gained weight after becoming a minister? All with god's blessing. -How are you uncle? How are you my dear? -I am fine, uncle. You have arranged a grand party. -All hard earned money. Hi! -Hi! Mani, get a table for sir, and attend to all his needs. Arjun, go! -Geeta, come. Father? -Yes, what is it Arjun. My friends. -Greetings, uncle. Hello. -And, this is Geeta... ...She is my.. -You and Geeta like each other. And you want to marry. Why are you shy, Arjun? Keep it up. Dear friends, thanks for being here today.. There's a good news to share... ..my son will be getting married soon. The bride, is none other than my good friend's daughter, Malini. Mother! -Geeta!What happened? You don't need my advice. Some people go to college, just to pass time. It is fun for them, but for us, our future depends on it. When making a decision, a boy may think only once. But a girl, should to think many times. That is because, if the boy makes a wrong choice.. ..it will only affect him. But for a girl, it will affect all those around her. We don't need all this. You mean everything to me. You. Your happiness.This is the reason I'm still alive. If anything should happen to you.. ..okay..let it go. Don't think about it. I don't like this wedding, father. -I don't really care. I have given them my word. That's important. I am not willing to give up an opportunity like this. Father, Malini is not a good girl. -It doesn't matter. I can't. I can't do this. That girl has wrapped you around her finger. Father! Quickly bring the medicine. Quickly bring it here. Don't think you can get what you want by shedding your blood. My decision is final. Understood? Aunty, please don't be sad. My uncle Kutti is there for you. He really loves you. Once he even.. -Hey, don't. Keep quiet. If you agree, we can have the wedding today. And the engagement? -We can have that tomorrow, okay? Okay! -Can you all stop this? Something has happened! Everything is broken. Arjun's father sent thugs to warn her. They broke everything. Come, you must be really happy now. Everything happened just as you wished for. I have lost. Have you come here to gloat? I won't let you lose. I will be back in 1 0 minutes. We will parade the elephants. Why such a grand engagement? Greetings! I'm Kutty I'm Geetha's lover. We must fulfill our lover's wishes. Geeta likes your son and I'm here to take him with me. I'm busy now.We'll talk later. He's busy now, call later. Bye! You are a kid. You don't know about me. Don't create havoc at this function. Leave now. He already said don't create any havoc at this function. Uncle, you carry on with the function.. ..I am only taking Arjun with me. Where is Arjun? - He's upstairs. Your father's men will be here any moment. You only have 5 minutes. Quickly decide what are you going to do. Do you know what are you doing? Yes I do. Just as she's important to me.. ..her wishes are also important to me. What's all this? Hands off me. Go! Aren't you ashamed for being slapped by a woman? Why are you still there? It's almost time for the wedding. I want my son here immediately. Kill them and bring Arjun back. Stop the car! -What? Stop the car! - Ok! Hey, continue driving. What happened? Are they here? No boss! Why must we wait for them? They can easily catch us then. Why? Are you tensed? We are athletes and it's like a warm up for us. You pushed me down at the college race that day. I struggled but still kept running. Won't you change? Why are you still torturing us? Won't you understand what we are saying? Are you happy to see others tensed? What's wrong with you? Why do you keep doing all these silly things? You made us run all the way here and blabber all the time. What's your problem? Geetha said she's hungry, give this to her. I know. You mind your own business. She's hungry and yet you are smoking.. .. you call yourself her lover? I'll give it to her if you can't. Hey! -What? Give it to me. -Why? I'll give her myself. No! I'll do it myself. Are you going to give it to me or not? This is what I told you earlier. Qkay! You give it to her. Geetha! You must be very hungry. Please eat this. - I don't want. You have not eaten since morning. Eat this now. I rejected when he offered me this.. .. and now he passed it to you? She even rejected your offer? Your seat near the bathroom is confirmed. Go settle down there. - Sir! Punch Paramasivam! -Where's my seat? You don't have a seat. -How come they are seated? That's because they never asked me. How's my punch line? I'll reverse the train if anyone tries to make me tensed. To all the passengers in this train.. .. you can still travel without a ticket, but must have.. .. a punch line in your dialogue. Qnly then people will remember us. Sir, don't you remember me? No! - It's ok then. Silence please! Why are you laughing? There's no punch line in his dialogue, why did you laugh? I was bored, that's why. So you'll laugh if you are bored? Give me your ticket. Why did you throw my ticket? The train will stop at the next station.. .. you can ran along the railway track to collect it. This is how a punch line should be. Biscuit? Biscuit? What's your name? - Kaveri! Your hometown? -Also Kaveri. Both are same, there's no punch. Ticket? Where's your ticket? Why are you asking me for a ticket? Don't you remember me? - No! I'm the one who met you earlier. He's trying to cheat me. What's your name? - Kutty! How small are you? - It's my name. What are you doing? I am in love. Punch dialoge? - A little bit. Who's that girl? - She's my lover. Who's this guy then? - He's her lover! Reverse! Coffee! Coffee! Boss!They are here. Go away! It's true they are here. Are you trying to pull my legs again? You better leave. Go search them. Come in! You wondered if your love will succeed or fail? No boss! It was your love. I still had doubts about your love. Just out of curiosity,.. ..did you run away because you love Geetha.. .. or because you don't like Malini. You are crossing your limit. - Please don't boss. Be careful boss! Come on! Hit me. You pretended as if you were helping to unite us.. .. and now you are hitting me. Enough, whatever you did for us. This is our love, let us handle it. Please, you can go now.Thanks! Geetha, you decide whether you want him or me. Your father only wants you. She is mine. Muthu, let her go. Brother, why are you threatening our Arjun? Leave this place. Arjun! Arjun! Geetha! Where is Arjun? Arjun! Arjun! Arjun! What happened, Geetha? Are you sad because Arjun left you alone? He wrote a letter saying that he's the cause of all the problems. ..he has gone to convince his father.. .. and return to take you back, until then, you take care. You don't believe me? My dearest Geetha. I'm sorry for leaving without telling you. I can't bear to see u suffer like this. Pity him. He must have been so sad when writing this. Why did you do it? Don't you have brains? She's sick and sleeping. That is why I'm awake, looking after her. But you tried to disturb her sleep. How dare you? You escaped because Geetha is a nice person. If it was anyone else, they would have stepped on you. Nonsense! Don't you know how to behave towards a guest? Arjun is far better than you. Do you know how nice Geeta is? Because he threatened to jump.. .. she decided to accept him. I'm telling you all these because I'm so expressive. Stop! How dare you? I'm talking to you but you just ignore me. You are awake! Everything is because of you. Sorry! You have changed? -What? You don't get angry with me nowadays. You haven't scolded me this whole day, you have really changed. I haven't changed. Just admit it. You have changed. I did not! I haven't changed. You haven't changed? - Yes! Qk! Shall I check if you've changed or not? - How? Let's switch characters for 5 minutes. What do you mean? It means, you are Kutty and I'm Geetha. Qk, good idea. - Is it good? Qk! Let's start. I Love You. Hello! I Love You. But I hate you. I hate such personalities. I love you so much. Then just keep it in your heart. Why say it out loud? You know something? I'm very expressive. I have so much of love for you. I hate to see your face. I Love You. Won't you change? Don't you understand when I tell you once? Are you mad? Why are you disturbing me? It's always the same feeling. I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! Geetha! He's so innocent. I'm not sure if his mother left money for him.. .. but before she died, she left him an abundance of love. He's so proud that no one has received as much love as he has. Innocent boy. He only knows how to give. He doesn't keep anything for himself. I was worried that he'll be alone forever. The Lord sent you to him. I'm happy after seeing you with him. What did you ask the Lord? You asked for Arjun to be back soon? In two or three days time.. No, he'll be back in 1 week. -You wrote that letter right? She caught me! Please talk! I'm asking you. What else are you hiding from me? Who are you and what do you want? Why do you love me so much? You used to blabber all the time. Talk to me now! This is the right time to talk. You always asked me to feel your love a little.. ..now you made me fall for you. Even my late father wouldn't have done this for me. I used to wonder about love. Qnly now I realise the real meaning of love. Why didn't I meet you earlier? Why didn't I fall in love with you? I'm sure you both are angry with me. It's understandable. I didn't know the meaning of love. For me, I could get any girl I wanted. I grew up that way. Because I didn't want you to get her.. .. I wanted her for myself. Qnly now I realise the real meaning of love. You are the reason I realised it. You were prepared to sacrifice your life for us. How are we going to pay you back? Even though you knew Geeta didn't love you.. .. you still wanted the best for her. That's when I realised I've never done anything for her. That's why I wanted to convince my father.. .. and take her back as a princess. So I left without informing you both. Geeta, please forgive me. I caused a lot of heartache for you. It's common that all the parents are against love. It's not because we hate love. We just want the best for our children. But after seeing Arjun's love for you.. .. I realised that he can't live without you. Arjun is my life, but you are his life. Who am I to come in between you both? There shouldn't be any politics in love. It's very shameful. I agree whole heartedly to your marriage. Kutti.. I like you very much. He left his lover with you for one week. It shows that he trusts you more than himself. To be honest, as far as this marriage is concerned.. ..you play a very important role. Shall we go? Problems solved. Thank you sir. Geetha, you are happy right? Let's go! She got scared. It's a minister's son's wedding.. ..but there are no beautiful girls. Everyone looks as horrible as you. Let's look over here. - Hey, you! You! - How are you? What are you looking at? Keep this over there. Take it. Someone is calling me. What happened? Has he changed sides? Uncle, call for you. What are you doing here, Sruthi? Go and help Geetha upstairs. Cry. At least cry now. I want to see you cry. Stop pretending. Everything is over. Don't think you are smart by pretending to be happy. Geetha! Can I talk to you for awhile? - Let's go. My love is about to end shortly, but before that. All this while, I thought love is only about giving. For the first time, I feel like asking. Can I ask you a question? At any point, did you feel what I felt? Don't you have even a little bit of feelings for me? You thought I would take everything so lightly. I'm also human, and I can get hurt too. If I remain here, after you. You believed everything I said? Crazy girl. She believed what I said. Look at your face.. Wish you a happy married life. Aunty, wish you a happy married life. It's yours. You lost it in Kanyakumari. Do you remember? Kavitha, it's times. Go and bring Geeta. Qk aunty. Geeta! I only want Kutti. End - [Team TST]
