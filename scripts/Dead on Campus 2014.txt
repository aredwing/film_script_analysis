No. Come have a drink with me! - You know I don't drink. - It's never too late to start. You've got college to think about. - I've got sleep to think about. - Come on! Summer's almost over.

It's the opposite of OK. - I didn't mean to, she just... - What, she assaulted you? Do you want me to call the cops? - Look, it just happened, all right? - Why did you even want to be with me? - I've never dated a smart girl before, only hot ones. - Good God! - I didn't mean to, I... Can you just... - Thanks. - I always got your back. (Alexa): That's her. - Are you sure she's the right girl? She is perfect. She is pretty. - Ms. Natalie Kellison is just the right bait to catch our little fish. - Oh, I thought you were going to call? Sorry, battery died... again. Oh. You need a new phone. I need a new life. - You, uh, wanna talk about it? (sighing) - Hey, Natalie. - Didn't realize it was a date night. - No, no, we were just, uh... - I really don't need to know. Nat... (crying quietly) - (Nikki): Did Billy call you yet? - My phone's dead. Hopefully, so is he. - Dude, that kid was training wheels. You're going to be getting so much action in college. Ivy League action. - Hey, guys are the last thing on my mind right now. I just want to get out of this town. I feel. So, how's the old man taking it, you leaving and all? - He'll be fine. He's got his girlfriend. - Jenny seems cool. Why you gotta be hating on her all the time? - I don't know, she's just... ...Not your mom? I miss her so much. I know. - She'd be so stoked to see you right now, following in her footsteps. Speaking of which... Check this out. - Dude, I don't read Latin. - Dude, it's Greek. Delta Psi Beta. - A sorority? - Only the most prestigious one in the country. - Why would you wanna hang out with a bunch of whack-ass prepster girls? My mom was a Delta Psi. - Still... - I mean, my mom used to say that her sorority sisters were closer to her an her own family. - Going away, I'm going away It's been good being home but I'm moving on (mouthing) And I know that it's been So long Yeah, I've got this fear but I can't face it here Oh, this time I won't look back I won't look back - Check the glove box. Sweet! Awesome... - I got myself one too so we can do that video chat thing. ...If you want. - Maybe. - If you're not too cool. - Thanks, Dad! (cheering) Charming. This is it, huh? This is it! Oh, leave it, Dad, I'll do it later. So, who's your roommate? - Her name's Sophia. We Skyped. She seems chill. I'll be fine, Dad. I know you will. Your mom would be so damn proud. You think? - She loved this school. Really loved the sorority. - Thanks, Dad - for everything. - No speeches. - Your restraint is admirable. - Call me, OK? I mean, when you have time? On the new phone. Going away, I'm going away It's been good being home But I'm moving on And I know that it's been so long All right. Yeah, I've got this fear but I can't face it here Oh, this time I won't look back I won't look back - How can you be sure he'll go for her? - A little program I acquired. It's the same algorithms they use on those dating sites. Here, look. They are both into electronic music, hiking... - Doesn't necessarily mean love connection. They've both lost parents. - That'll help. - I know. - Roomie! - Hey! Sophia... (laughing) - Ahh! - OK... - Oh, is this your mom? - Yeah, it is... Oh, she's beautiful. You almost kind of look alike. - Oh, uh, thanks... - OK, let's go check out the real estate! - You don't wanna unpack first? - Later. There are boys out there. Eco club? Please! - Do you have an objection to cleaning up the planet? - Hey, I recycle. - They're cute. - Omega Mu frat boys. We can do better. - What's wrong with a fraternity? I mean, I'm pledging a sorority. - Me too! - Which one? - Delta Psi. - Me too! - Really? - Why are you so surprised? - You just don't strike me as the type. - Well, what type? - You know... Super status-conscious, over- privileged rich girl. Like me! (laughing) - Well, I'm a legacy. Same. My sister was Delta Psi. My mom. - Huh. Guess they must look at those roommate surveys after all. - OK, so what was wrong with the frat boys? - It's all about which fraternity. Omega Mu is strictly business class. Got it. It's true, they are. - (Sophia): Ahh... It's beautiful. - OK, this is one of the oldest buildings in the city. I'm talking Founding Fathers old. Cool, I guess. Come on! Let's go. Hi... Hi! I'm Sophia. This dress feels weird. - It looks stunning on you. I'm so glad it fit. - I think the last time I wore one was my confirmation. I think I was 12. - You're Catholic? My mom was. She's not anymore? She, actually, um... ...passed away. - Oh, my God... How long ago? I was in tenth grade. - Good evening, ladies. I'm Leanna, head of the rush committee. - Sophia Davis. - Monica's little sister? - Guilty. - And... you are? Natalie Kellison. - Natalie's an architecture major. Very talented. - Really? My parents have a Frank Lloyd Wright home. Oh, wow! That's impressive. I mean, I'm more of an I.M. Pei gal, but... Well... Have fun. Well, she hates me! - (Sophia): Don't be silly. You're charming. Awkward charming, but still. Thanks. - There's the girl we really need to impress. Alexa Cooper, sorority president Her father's a congressman. - Well, I mean, should we go talk to her? You never approach Alexa! OK? She approaches you. Mm-hmm... Oh, hi. - Alexa Cooper. - I know. I mean, I... Sorry. I'm Natalie. Natalie Kellison. Freshman. School of Architecture. 2200 on your SATs. - 2160... - Well, I was rounding. But either way, rather impressive. - I'm good at taking tests. - We'll have to see about that. - What else do you know about me? - Everything! Everything to do with your application, that is. I make it a point to review legacies personally, and your mother was a remarkable woman. Successful architect, charity fundraiser... Big shoes to fill. - Yeah, they are. - Enjoy the rest of your evening. Thanks. That was weird... - Natalie, you've made it to the next round. Tomorrow night, midnight. OK, girls Time to get down to our couture bad selves - Ouch! - Aw, it's perfect! Try it on. - I couldn't afford to rent a dress like this. - Don't worry about it. Today's little shopping excursion is on me. - No, I couldn't. - To be precise, it's on my evil ex-stepfather. He hurt my mom so bad, he's still paying for it. - OK... - Super cute. You look amazing! - Yeah? - Oh, my God! You have to wear that. - You think? - Yes. - (Alexa): This sorority is our family. That you are standing here today means that we see something in you. A certain potential. Few have it, and even fewer are able to realize it. In order to become one of our sisters, you will have to prove to us you have what it takes to realize that potential. As you stand here in the darkness, look deep into your heart, into your soul, and ask yourself: Do I have what it takes? I took you to the edge I told you to get undressed And you did Because I told you And I held you until morning With nothing In between us We are not strangers anymore I took you deep inside A candle of your light Sit down. Your time has come. Are you ready to face your challenge? Uh... Yours is a quest, for you and you alone. You may not share these details with anyone. Not your friends, not your family. No one. Do you so swear? Uh, yeah, I... - You say, "I swear. " - I swear. - Now, open it and read it aloud. "I, Natalie Kellison, will... " Read it. - "I, Natalie Kellison, will seduce a young man of the sorority's choosing. " - I don't think I can do... - Silence. You do not speak, you do not ask questions. You have until noon tomorrow to accept this quest. Do so, and you become one of our sisters. Don't... ...and you'll live forever in obscurity. (Sophia): Come on. Spill. - They said not to tell anyone. - Mm. Anyone outside of the sorority. - They want me to seduce someone. - Oh, that's so much better than mine. - I don't know if I can do it. - Of course you can. Who's the guy? Or is it a girl? - It's a guy, but I don't know who it is yet. - Doesn't matter. Guys are all the same. Little smile, little skin, boom! You're in. - I don't know, it's just not really my style. Besides, I don't know how far they want me to go. Nat, hello! This is college. You're bound to have some random hook-ups, this one just gets you the golden ticket. - Ready for your future to begin? Sumner Williams. Sophomore, varsity track team. Here, I'm sending it to you. - Ugh... My ex was a jock. - You don't have to marry him. What exactly do I have to do? - Get him to notice you, get him to go out with you, and then... - And then what? - Take him back to your room and rock his world. - So you're saying I have to sleep with him? - We're Delta Psi, not the Bunny Ranch. You do whatever you want, just make sure he's into you. - Are we good? - We're good. Here's his class schedule. He'll be getting out of econ soon. Go get him, little sister. (phone ringing) - Well, look at you, all 21st-century! - Can you see me OK? - Yeah, Dad. What's up? - Oh, no, nothing, I just had to try this out. Pretty cool, right? - It's cool. - I got Jenny one too, but she's not too crazy about this whole video thing. - Yeah, well, the picture isn't always flattering. - Nat... You know, someday you're going to have to give her a chance. Hey, look, Dad, I gotta go. - I'll see you soon. - Bye. Uh, excuse me... - Can you help me? I'm looking for the Bregman Building. Breg... Bregman, that's across campus. So you go past the admin building, you turn left, walk for about 30, 40 yards, and it'll be... - You know, I'm really bad with directions, do you think you could show me? - I've got a class... - Please? I'd really appreciate it. - Yeah... Yeah, I can... This way. Thanks. - (Natalie): How do you like school? (Sumner): It's all right. - What's your major? - Mechanical engineering. - Really? I'm in architecture. Got something in common already. - I'm actually more into the industrial applications of things, so... Anyway, that's Bregman up there, I've really gotta go. I'm sorry. - Uh, wait. I didn't even get your name. - Sumner. I'm... - Well, thanks, Sumner. I'd have been lost without you. But hey, can I make it up to you? Maybe we can go out to coffee or something? Uh, sure... - Why don't you put your number in here? OK... - Ah, this'll do the trick! - That'll turn a trick. Isn't that the idea? - Thanks for offering, but I think I'll just go with my own stuff. - OK. Um... Well, you have to at least let me do your makeup. Oh, um... - You never go into battle without war paint. - Ugh... I don't know if I can go through with this. - Look, it's not like they're gonna be in the room watching, OK? Just get the guy back here, and do as much as you feel comfortable doing. - None of this feels comfortable. Just have fun, OK? - (Sumner): I like to hike a lot. No way! I love hiking. You look different. I don't usually wear makeup. Hmm. You should. You look good. Not that you didn't look good before, it's just, what I'm... I get it. Thanks. - So, do you have any brothers or sisters? No, just me. You? Yeah, sister. Danielle. She actually works at the school. She's a career counsellor. Good person to know. - I wouldn't be going here if it weren't for her. - I get a big break on tuition. - Yeah, must be nice. So she's older? She's 12 years older. - That's a pretty big gap. Why'd your folks wait so long? I don't know. You never asked them? - They, um... They died when I was pretty young. It was a car accident. Oh... I'm so sorry. - Yeah, uh... Danielle pretty much raised me. - So this is you. - You don't live in the dorms? No, with my sister. - This... This was fun. - We should do it again. Yeah, OK. Yeah. ...Good night. Uh... 'Night. Good night. You call that seduction? What? It was a first date. - Ugh, God. It was like watching Lady and the Tramp. - You were watching? - Of course we were watching! The Delta Psis are fierce. We get what we want, and we get it when we want it. You're going to have to show us more. A lot more. - What do you want me to do? - Whatever you have to do to make him want you. Need you. Lose sleep over you. You have one more chance to prove yourself. One. So, you actually like the guy? - I mean, I didn't expect to, but... Yeah, I kinda do. Is he into you? - I mean, there were moments I thought so, but then... I don't know. - Look, you don't exactly have the luxury of a long courtship, here. OK? You need to close the deal. - Well, I'm not just going to jump into bed with him. I mean, even if I could. - You can, and you should. Or at least some major making out. You need to show these girls what you're made of. What am I made of? - Nat, you're, like, one of the coolest chicks I've ever met, and I roll with some pretty cool peeps. - I just can't imagine my mom doing anything like this. She was so... respectable. She was also young. - I guess... - You know, it'd be a shame if I had to join without you. - You got in? - Delta Psi forever! (Sophia laughing) - Hey. - Hi, little bro. - How you doin'? - How was your date? - Good enough to get me another one tonight. Look at you! - Yeah... I hate to ask again, but... - No, no, it's no problem. - Thank you. Thank you so much. I will pay you back. Yeah, I know you will. Have fun. - I will try to have fun. Have a good day. - OK, bye! - The first time we met, we both had the feeling This could be it This could be for all time Now with regret I can't see the reason Just why I'm not yours And you still aren't mine Yes, I've been waiting for you for all of my life So lucky that you are here And you've been waiting for me for all of your life Our only mistake is the fear Oh... - Hey... What are you doing here? - I'm so sorry. Sophia gave me her key. It's midnight movie night at Delta Psi and she was on dessert duty. May I? Sure. - Brownies... - Double chocolate fudge. - I love fudge. - Who doesn't? - Here, have another. - Oh, thank you! - Oh, I'm good. - You sure? Chocolate's a total turn-on. Well... You two have fun. (muttering) - Whoa... Did you see that? - See what? - Oh, my God, they're everywhere. Oh, my God! - What? - Get off! Get off! - What are you... What's wrong? - Hey there, stud! (all laughing) - (sister #1): Sit down. - (sister #2): Have a seat. (Sumner babbling) (distorted voices) What are you guys doing? What's happening here? - (sister): Where are you going, princess? (Leanna): You sexy beast! - Stop it! What the hell is wrong with you? - That is no way to talk to your sisters. Sumner! Sumner! (door shutting) His car's still there... - (Nat): Leave him alone! - (sister): All right, shut up. (door opening) - Natalie, you have to see this. - I've seen enough. - You have to admit, it's pretty funny. - It's pretty messed up, is what it is. This'll go viral, for sure. - You know what I think I might do? Edit a little bit, add some music... The brownies. - You put something in the brownies. - She only did what she was asked to do. Just like you. - If I had known... - Forget about him. Now that you're with us, you have your pick of the hottest guy on campus. Congratulations, Natalie Kellison. You are officially a sister of the Delta Psi Betas. (applauding) (sister): Go, girl! - I didn't know what they had planned, I swear. - I thought the brownies were just for us to party. Some party. - Come on, Natalie. Cheer up. You're a Delta Psi now. Is it the guy? Is that what's bothering you? It doesn't bother you? Look, when my sister rushed, she had to run naked across the football field during the game. It's all just stupid fun. (distorted ringing) (phone ringing) - Hi, you've reached Sumner, leave a message. (tires screeching) (horn blaring) I'm gonna make you disappear My anger's growing Gonna wait until the time comes for pain The end is coming now All I really want is just to be Another girl Pretending to be nice So dangerous inside And I won't stop - All she really wants is just to be Another girl Pretending to be nice So dangerous inside And I won't stop This is the end Natalie! It's Sumner... - What about him? - There was an accident. He's dead. - What? How? - His car went off the road. - He didn't have his car. I saw him leave without it. - He must have come back. - Are you sure? - The cops are just here talking to the dean. He was already dead when they found him. Oh, my God! - (Alexa): Natalie, I'm sorry about Sumner. - (Natalie): I still can't believe it. - It was supposed to be a harmless prank. I never imagined things could go this wrong. - You should have. - Yeah, you're right. Of course. Look, I'm sick about it. - Why did you even do it? - I don't know. It's just... It was stupid. Look, I hate to have to bring this up right now, but it's important that our stories are straight. "Stories"? - If anyone asks, we were all at the house last night. - Why would I lie? - As sisters, it's important that we protect each other. - I didn't even know what you guys were doing! - But you were the only one calling or texting him. - Are you threatening me? - What? No! No, of course not. But if this gets out, I can't promise you that the other girls won't blame you to protect themselves. As far as anyone else is concerned, this was an accident. A tragic accident. But if it becomes anything more than that, we all have a lot to lose. Yeah, that's... That's him. My parents... My parents, um... - (police officer): These are your brother's personal effects. The, uh... The coroner's report indicated that he had high levels of THC and MDMA in his bloodstream. That's weed and ecstasy. - Do you know where he might have gotten these drugs? - Sumner ran long distance. He never touched drugs. Danny... Almost everyone tries it once in a while. - No, you... You don't understand. He always played everything so safe. I was trying to get him to come out of his shell. Well... Maybe he did. - No. Not like that. - Look... Drugs are a big problem on campus, even with all the ivy on the walls. If you hear anything, please give me a call. Yeah, we will. Thanks. I'm sorry for your loss. - (Alexa): There are times in a sorority where you're called upon to make sacrifices. I'm afraid this is one of those times. What do you want me to do? I'm sorry, Maddy, but I'm going to have to ask you to move out of the house. - You've gotta be kidding. Why me? - Well, ours is not to reason why. Caitlin will be joining you as well. I found a great 2-bedroom apartment right outside of campus. The truck will be here in one hour. - This is ridiculous! I'm not moving! - Excuse me? - I've done a lot for the sorority. I've earned living here. - We've done a lot for you, too. Or did you forget about that little sex tape that we managed to squash before it circulated all over campus? - I mean... It'd be a shame if it resurfaced. - You wouldn't. - Please. There's nothing I wouldn't do for the Delta Psis. Absolutely nothing. - There you are! I've been calling you. I'm not feeling very social. - Alexa texted us, she's got good news. Come on! Get dressed. Hey! - Hello, hello! - Hey! - So, I know we didn't get off to the best start, but a couple of the rooms have just become available, and I nominated you both to get them. - I thought you had to be at least a junior to get in here. - Seniors, mostly, and even then there's a waiting list. So why us? Well, I figured that it must be hard living in the dorms, after everything that's happened. You both have shown such great poise in dealing with it all. - The vote was unanimous. You can move in today! - But we had to sign a lease at the dorms. - Oh, I spoke to the Dean of Housing. The Delta Psis do have some pull around here. - Oh, that can go in my room. - Yes. (Alexa): See? Told you. Everything's under control. - Guess you got a little more than even. - Yeah, I feel bad for Sumner, but... That bitch got what she deserved. - (Aiden): You should take some time off work. I need to keep busy. Is there anything I can... ...do for you? You know, the funeral... No. I'll handle it. I just want something small. - I just wish there was something I could do to help. You already have. - Feels like home, doesn't it? - It's beautiful. - I know. - I trust you're finding everything to your liking? - It's beautiful. - Yeah, it is. - Well, you guys should start getting ready. - For what? - Hello! Only the biggest party of the year! We co-host with the Alpha Rhos. - No way! They have, like, some of the hottest guys on campus. - Oh, they do indeed. - I think I'm just gonna lay low. - Getting out's gonna be good for you. I have a car coming here at 8:00. You guys can ride with me. Get to know each other a little better. Let's go, Nat! It's party time! (loud dance music playing) - That girl... - What? - I don't know why I didn't think. Sumner was out with that girl that night. Natalie. Here she is. So you think it's her? - I'm sure as hell gonna find out. Mm-hmm. Danny... Why don't you call the police and let them handle it? - You saw how the police reacted after I told them about Sumner. - Mm-hmm. - To them, he's just another statistic. - Hi, this is Danielle Williams, Sumner's sister. Could you please call me back? I'm sorry, Danny. He's with Mom and Dad now. - Hey, party girl! How's it going? Pretty rough. - You know you shouldn't have gone. - No-one saw me. How did you know I was there? - Sophia told me. She's worried about you. We all are. She called me. - Who called you? - Sumner's sister. - Did you speak to her? - No, I didn't, I can't... - No, you have to, or else it's going to look suspicious. - What am I supposed to tell her? - As little as possible. Say that you were helping him with his homework or something. - We didn't have any classes together. - Look, you'll... You'll think of something. The most important thing right now is that if she asks about the night that he died, we stick to the same story, OK? - And if she doesn't believe me? - It doesn't matter what she believes. I mean, we have a house full of sisters to back us up. - Don't you feel guilty at all? Of course I do. Look, if I could take it back, I would. But I can't. None of us can. - The best thing that we can do right now is move on. (phone ringing) Hello? Who is this? - Hi, uh, this is Natalie. You called me? - Uh, yeah, thank you for calling me back, um... How well did you know Sumner? ...Not very. I mean, we met at the bookstore once, he asked for my number, that was pretty much it. But you went out with him? Uh, no, I didn't. - But he said he was starting to see someone, and there are a bunch of calls between you two on his phone. - Yeah, he called me a few times. im II asn't interested. - Why did you give him your number? I didn't want to be rude. - So you have no idea where he was the night he died? - I'm sorry, I wish I could help. Natalie! I'm Danielle Williams. I was hoping that we could finish our conversation. - Uh, how did you find me? - I work here. - I already told you everything. - How about a coffee? - OK. You were seeing my brother. - No. I mean, I already told you... - But you guys talked that night. He used his credit card for dinner. Over $100. You think if I show your picture around the restaurant, someone might remember you? OK, we had dinner. Why did you lie? I don't know. I didn't want to get involved. We only went out twice. What did you do after dinner? - Nothing, I mean, he just dropped me off. What time? - Maybe 8:00, 8:30... - Really? That's early for a date. - I had class in the morning, so... - It wasn't that long ago I was a freshman here. I know the scene. Parties. Party favours. - What are you trying to say? - Maybe you and Sumner wanted to heighten the experience? A little weed, little ecstasy... - No, I don't do drugs. Well, neither did Sumner. Somehow he managed to do a bunch. Enough to get him killed. - Well, he didn't do anything that I saw. What did you do after that? - Just hung out at the sorority. - Which sorority? Delta Psi Beta. - Oh, you're a Delta Psi? - Listen, I really have to go. - Was Alexa there? - Sorry? - Alexa Cooper. She's the president. - I really have to go. I'm really sorry about your brother. Well, I did what you told me. I lied. - Good. I knew you had it in you. Then she tracked me down! I mean, she caught me off guard... - OK, calm down. What did you say to her, exactly? - Nothing. I mean, I told her Sumner and I had dinner once, but that I spent the rest of the night here. - Good. Good, then we have nothing to worry about. - Well, I'm pretty sure she didn't believe me. - I told you, it doesn't matter. - She asked about you. - She did? - When I brought up Delta Psi. That's sweet of her. - You two know each other? - We've crossed paths. - Wait, is she the reason... - Forget about her. This is about you. Here. - What is this? - Greta Cummings. The architect. You have heard of her, right? - Yeah, of course, she's cutting-edge. Well, she's also an alum, and there's a summer internship coming up at her firm, and she wants to see you for it. - Me? - Yeah. This is how it works, girl. You are one of us, now. And a membership, it does come with its privileges. - (Danielle): She knows what happened. I know she does. - You're on shaky ground, here, Danny. Using university records, interrogating a student... - Do you think I care about my job right now? - I think you should. - This has something to dwith Alexa Cooper. Wanna bring me up to speed? - Alexa Cooper, it's Harrison Cooper's daughter. What, the congressman? - Yeah, that's him! She is daddy's little girl in all the worst ways. - You really don't like this girl. - I make it a point not to get personal with my students, but this one... She was up for a big internship last summer, and it was between her and another girl and I recommended the other girl, who was better qualified, by the way. And they listened to me. - Let me guess, Daddy didn't approve? - No, no, I didn't hear from him, but I heard from her. She called me every name under the sun, threatened to sue me, get me fired, you name it. - So you think she drugged Sumner to get to you? I wouldn't put it past her. - Greta Cummings. - Natalie Kellison. - Is that your portfolio? - Yeah. I really love your work. I mean, the way you find beauty in asymmetrical design... - You've done your research. That's good. Delta Psi sees potential in you. So do I. - Wow, thanks. - Yes, well... How badly do you want to be an architect? - Very. It's all I've ever wanted. - Well, if that's true, there may be a place for you here. - Are you serious? - Work harder than everyone else, be fearless in your design and come see me in the spring. I will, thank you. - Alexa. - Ms. Williams! - Can I speak to you? - Of course. I'll catch you guys later. - Small world, isn't it? - How so? - One of your new pledges was out with my brother, the night that he died. - Was she? - You're too smart to play dumb. - Not smart enough for you to recommend me. It was you. - My father pulled a lot of strings to get me that opportunity, and you just cut them. - Gutless little bitch! - Excuse me? - You killed him! - I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. - You disappointed your daddy, and you killed my brother. - I'm sorry for your loss, but you are way out of line here. - How can you... You killed him. You need help. I'm going down Can't see the light There's no turning back I'm losing my mind Thank you. - Doctor Niroc. You wanted to see me. - Have a seat. - OK. - First, allow me to offer my sincerest condolences for the loss of your brother. - Oh... Thank you. I got the flowers that you sent. They were beautiful. - You've been with us almost 10 years now. - Yes, sir. - I trust you understand the various fiduciary duties we have as a university. - Of course. - Someery wealthy, very influential people have entrusted us, not only with the higher education of their children, but often with substantial endowments. This is about Alexa, isn't it? - I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you, but we can't have a member of our staff accosting students on campus. - She's responsible for my brother's death. - And we certainly cannot make unsupported allegations. I get it. Money talks. - This isn't a matter of money. It's a matter of proper conduct. As one of the most esteemed schools in the country, we must hold ourselves to the highest of standards. (footsteps) (knocking on door) - Come in. - Hey, what's up? - Natalie left. - What do you mean, she left? - Someone saw her leaving earlier. She had a bag packed. - Dad? I didn't see your truck out there. - Natalie. - Where's my dad? - There was an emergency at one of his buildings. We were right in the middle of Chinatown. - I'm going to go grab some food. - We made lasagna, let me heat some up for you. Your father does nothing but rave about you, you know. He couldn't be more proud. He exaggerates. I doubt that. I know we haven't talked much, but I want you to know that I care about your father very much. He's the... kindest, sweetest, most honest man I've ever met. The way he talks about you, your passion, your integrity... I would never do anything to hurt him, or you. Never. I'm gonna go... - No... I mean, you don't have to. He'd want you to stay. (TV playing) Dad? Hey. Got any hot chocolate? Yeah, come on. So I take it you two talked. Yeah. She's all right, I guess. - I know, I'm just glad you think so too. - I'm happy to see you and all, but what are you doing here? - I just needed to clear my head. There's this boy I met... Uh-oh. Boy trouble already? He... died. What happened? - There was an accident. A car accident. - Wait, I think I read about this in the paper. Kid ran varsity track. You knew him? Not very well, but yeah. - Said there were drugs involved. That's what I heard. - I'm afraid you're going to see a lot of that in college. - Yeah, I saw a lot of that in high school. How long can you stay? - Just 'til tomorrow, I have class in the afternoon. I'll drive you. Thanks, Dad. So... that's the whole story. (Nikki): Ok, well... Like, say you do the right thing and tell the truth. What's the worst case scenario? Some of the girls blame me. I get expelled, maybe even go to jail. Well, if you weren't involved, then there's no evidence that you were, right? - We were out that night. I mean, he called me. And I already lied about knowing him. - Well, you can't be the only one with a conscience. Like, can't you get one of the other girls to back you? - No. I mean, they're all either too loyal or too scared. I never should have gone along with the whole thing. - And you never should have pledged to that stupid sorority. But you're not responsible for this kid's death. - It's just all the stories my mom used to tell me about Delta Psi, and how they supported each other and helped each other... These bitches have twisted it all around. So... What do we do about this? Well, dj vu. I know, right? - Nat, I get the feeling there's something you're not telling me. It's complicated. Anything I can do? - No. - Is there anything you can do? - That's where it gets complicated. - Well, when things get complicated, I like to simplify them. I wish it were that easy. I didn't say it was easy. You know, doing the right thing rarely ever is. - How did you know it was about doing the right thing? - 'Cause I know you, and I know that look on your face. Just like your mom used to get. Look, just know that whatever you do, I'll be there for you. Thanks, Dad. (cell phone ringing) - Hello? Can we talk? Sure. - Then I guess he must have gone back to his car, and by then, I mean, there was nothing I could do. And you really didn't know what Alexa was up to? I never would have been a part of something like that on purpose, even if I hated the guy - and I liked Sumner, I really did. - And you're going to tell this all to the police? - I will, but I think it might be better if I can find someone else to back me up. - Those girls will never do it. - There's one that might. (cell phone ringing) - (Leanna): They're meeting again. Doesn't look good. - I see. Yeah, we're going to have to put an end to this. Should we prepare the package? - Yeah, I'll let you know when they're ready. (Leanna hanging up) You can't go to the police. - I have to. We have to! - No way. - You said yourself, you didn't know what they had planned. - No one's going to believe me. Or you. OK? These bitches mean business. - So do I. - Look... When I was making the brownies, Alexa had her camera. She'll make it look like you and I set up Sumner together. - Unbelievable. - It's what she does. Gets dirt on people and then uses it as leverage to get whatever she wants. - Well, I'm sorry, but I have to do this. - I really thought we were friends. - Orange jacket, burgundy bag. That's her. - Natalie Kellison? - Yes? - We need to search you. - Search me for what? Hand over the bag, please. Raise your arms for me, please. What's going on? What are those? - You tell us. It's not mine. Stop, it's not mine. Stop! - (officer): Save your stories for the police. - (student): Don't tase me, dude! (students laughing) Dad? - Case number 14539-2, Natalie Jean Kellison, possession of controlled substances. - (Solomon): Your honour, if I may... Bryce Solomon, attorney for Ms. Kellison. - You're the public defender? - God, no. I represent Delta Psi Beta. - Trial date will be January 24, bail is set at $50,000. - Your honour, please, I... - You'll get your chance to speak at trial, young lady. Next case. - Thanks so much for bailing me out. I didn't. He did. - Actually, Alexa Cooper paid your bail. - Why would she do that? She's the reason I'm here in the first place. - This is perhaps not the best place to discuss the details of your case. Spend some time with your family. We'll talk soon. - (Natalie): Great. Now, on top of everything else, I'm suspended for the rest of the semester. - The school has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to drugs. - Whatever happened to being innocent until proven guilty? - Uh, that's our law. The university has its own. - You know, I still don't understand why Alexa would bail Natalie out. - (Aiden): Plausible deniability. Makes her look legit. - You keep quiet, the lawyer gets you off. - Gets her off how? - Bryce Solomon is a master of technicalities. The guy's got a flawless record. - (Danielle): Natalie doesn't play along, he loses his first case in years and she goes to jail. Either way, Alexa is above reproach. - You know, there must be one of these other girls who's willing to stand up to her. - She surrounds herself with people she can control. - Sophia told me she has dirt on everyone, holds it over their heads. - I've heard that too, I just thought it was urban legend. ...So she would have kept it. - She would have kept what? - The memory card. She was filming Sumner and all the girls when they were messing with him. She was going to put it on the internet before... Before he died. - I see where you're going with this. Does she incriminate herself? - No, she was holding the camera, but the other girls do. - Yeah, but you can't just break into her room to get it. - Well, she wouldn't keep it in her room, she has girls in and out of there all the time. She doesn't even lock her doors. - If she does keep this kind of dirt on people, she must have accumulated quite a collection. - Her father's house! She's there at least once a month. - Well, you sure as hell can't break into a congressman's home. - Well, I won't have to. I was invited. Alexa's birthday party. She has it there every year. - This is crazy. If that lawyer can get you off, I'll hire another one who can do the same. You can go back to school, get on with your life and forget all about this sorority. - It's not just about these charges, Dad. Someone needs to stand up to this girl. I need to. For Sumner. For myself. - I'm not gonna lie and say I approve. But I'd probably do the same damn thing. Be careful. - (mouthing): Thank you. (knocking on door) Alexa? - My, you have had quite a weekend. - Um... Yeah, I just wanted to thank you for bailing me out. - Hey, no problem, it's what we do. - I also just wanted to apologize. I mean, I was about to make a big mistake. Were you? - Let's just say, I've had a bit of a wake-up call. - And... you're awake now? - Wide awake. Good. It's good to have you back. - All right, then. - See you later. - Oh... Hey. - Hey. Look... I'm really sorry. It's OK. Just... I just feel like I got you into this whole mess. Don't worry about it. We're good. We're all good. So, luckily for us, the congressman is a shameless self-promoter. He was featured in Architecture Monthly. There are 7 bedrooms, 2 on the main floor and 5 upstairs, including the master suite. - How do you know that? - I just extrapolated the data. There were also some photos I used from the magazine for reference. - That is amazing! - That's Natalie - amazing. - So, I'm going to make sure Alexa is occupied, while my lovely assistant Nikki finds out which room is hers. - I already know which room is hers. - How? - Easy. The one with the biggest closet. - How are you going to get in in the first place? I mean, you don't really look like a sorority girl. - I'll take that as a compliment. - The party's being catered, so Nikki's gonna pose as one of the waiters. - Sadly, as an aspiring musician, I've had plenty of experience. - How does that work? Wouldn't they have to hire you? - These gigs are freelance. There are always, sort of, people coming in and out. - OK, what about security? Her dad's a congressman. It's bound to be pretty tight. - Well, it normally is, but her parents are out of town for the weekend, so she has the place all to herself. - Her parents are out of town on her birthday? I know, right? - What if she has a safe or something like that? I'll crack it. Just kidding! We'd be screwed. - Thank you, girls, for doing this. - Someone needs to bring this bitch down. - What she said. - You really think she's come around? - So it would appear. - I still don't trust her. - Like my daddy's fond of saying, you don't trust people. Own them. (dance music playing) (camera shutters clicking) - Oh, my... The invitation said no gifts! - We can take them back. - Oh, shut up! Put them over there and make yourselves at home. Champagne, ladies? - Yeah! - You ready? - Ready to put this tray down. You know I hate seafood. You're a rock star. Hey, girl... (Natalie): Hey! - (slurring words): You know what? You really are the best. (cell phone dinging) Sisters! - I'll be right back. Uh, Alexa! - I'll be right back, I'm just going to freshen up a little. - I saw a guy and a girl heading into one of the bedrooms down the hall... - Oh, it's cool. - Uh, she looked pretty wasted. Like she was gonna hurl. - OK, that's not cool. I hate when that happens. (cell phone ringing) - Hey. - OK, you have to hurry, she's gonna be upstairs in a minute. - OK, there's a locked jewellery box in her closet, it's the only place left to look. - Can you get it open? - If I had some tools, maybe. - Never mind, just get out of there. - There was no one in the bedroom. - Oh! She must have been too drunk to, you know... - Ha ha! Yeah, hate when that happens. - Oh! What are you doing up here? - I was just looking for the bathroom. Oh, we have 11 bathrooms, but the one for the help is right downstairs. - Oh... My bad. - No worries. - Hey. - Sure you looked everywhere?... OK. - Everywhere... except for that jewellery box. - Ahem... We're not paying you to bother the guests. Oh... She's not bothering me. - Yes, well, she still has a job to do, so if you don't mind... OK... - Hey! Just where do you think you're going? Um... Girl problems. Trust me, you don't want to know the details. My grandmother's jewels. Beautiful, aren't they? I knew something was up. You gave in a little too willingly. Tell me, what is it that you're hoping to find, hmm? Wait, let me guess. Drugs? No... The video? Of course! 'Cause the video would prove your little story, wouldn't it? - It's not a story! A guy is dead because of you! This is getting boring. You really think that I would be stupid enough to keep something like that? - That's what you do, isn't it? Keep dirt on people? - I thought you were smarter than the rest of them. Guess I was wrong. - What are you talking about? - I don't need to "keep dirt", as you call it. I just make people believe I have it. - But Sophia, I mean... - Sophia is a needy little bitch that would sell crack to her mother just so she could be popular. All of these girls; weak, entitled, pitiful. The reason why they join a sorority in the first place is to fill some sad, miserable little hole in their heart. But you can relate to that, can't you? Right? Mommy's little girl. Go to hell! - But I have to give it to you, though. You have some cojones, coming in here, going all Ocean's 11. - You know what? I don't care what happens to me, I'm going to tell the truth. To the police, to the university, to anyone who will listen to me. - No one is going to listen, not without proof. - How do you live with yourself? - When I was younger, I used to spend a lot of time in this room. Any time my dad would fight with my mom, or his second wife, or his third. I would come in here, and just lose myself in all my beautiful clothes. - Oh, I'm supposed to feel sorry for you, now? - But the most important thing I learned, I learned right here in this room: I'm the only person in the world that gives a damn about me. - You're pathetic. If you don't mind, I have a party to attend to. Can you find your way out? Silly me. Of course you can. You found your way in. Ugh... - (Nikki): Natalie! Hold up! - Let's just get out of here. - Just hang on. Come on. - What? (music stops) - Yo, how y'all feelin'? (all cheering) I got a little something special for you guys, a birthday surprise for your girl Alexa. (cheering and applauding) You ready? Hit it. - (over loudspeakers): - I don't need to "keep dirt", as you call it. I just make people believe I have it. - But Sophia, I mean... - Sophia is a needy little bitch that would sell crack to her mother just so she could be popular. All of these girls... (crowd murmuring) ...weak, entitled, pitiful. The reason why they join a sorority in the first place is to fill some sad, miserable little hole in their heart. But you can relate to that, can't you? Right? Mommy's little girl. - Go to hell! - But I have to give it to you, though. You have some cojones, coming in here, going all Ocean's 11. You know what? I don't care what happens to me, I'm going to tell the truth. To the police, to the university, to anyone who will listen to me. - No one is going to listen, not without proof. - How do you live with yourself? (Niroc): Natalie Kellison; upon review of your testimony and the testimony of so many of your sorority sisters, it is the decision of this committee that you be reinstated immediately. Thank you. - What about Alexa? What happens to her? - Ms. Cooper has elected to withdraw her enrolment in the university. She's also resigned as the president of Delta Psi Beta. We will watch your back So you can start Walking again - Compliments to the chef. Dinner looks amazing. - Yeah, it does. A toast: to the things we've lost and the things we've found. - That's great. - To family. - To family. - (all): Cheers.
