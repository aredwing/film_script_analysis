Uptown express, okay! - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. Hey, you! Come back here. Sorry about your bike. Come back here! Cam. Cam. You want your check or not? Sorry. Lonnie, I need more runs. Cam, I'm happy to help you out, but you need a bike first, man. Got a friend that can loan you one? Hey... keep your head up. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! - What? - Where you been hiding? Whatcha got there, Cam? - Nothing. - Nothing? Okay, so what? You forget about us or what? No, no, no, I didn't... I didn't forget. I just... I didn't have it. I just got that. Okay. Well, what else you got? - Come on. - Come on, man. Are you serious? I am serious. - What is that, $9.00? - Yeah, $9.00, probably. - Where's all your money going, man? - To you guys! You came to us for a loan, right, Cam? You accepted our terms. 1500. - On the first of each month, every month. - I know. I know. I know. I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry I missed a payment. It won't happen again. No, it won't. Now. Sign this please. Jerry, I owe somebody rent. Don't you wanna... And what, you think I'm doing this for fun? - No, I c... - This is my job, Cam, okay? I got a boss just like you got a boss. Now just sign it, okay? This is the second time you've been late. And... that makes us... What's that make us? - Nervous. - Nervous. See? - Yeah. - Hu is nervous. So, you owe us $15,000. And just don't miss another payment. I won't. - Don't miss another payment. - I know. - You good, buddy? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm good. Okay. Where's your bike? I... I hit a pothole. It looks like you got bigger problems. Let's get in here. All right. When are we gonna go for a ride? Car's still broken, buddy. I haven't had time to work on it. And I don't have the money or the parts I need. Maybe you ought to sell it. - Yeah, maybe. - Joey? All right, you're good to go. - Thanks a lot, Cam. - You're welcome. I told you to give Cam his space. - Chill-lax, Mom. It's all gravy. - Chill-lax? - Sorry about that. - Don't worry about it. He's a good kid. Hey, Ang. Can I talk to you for a second? I'm gonna be a little late on the rent this month. I'm sorry. I'll get it to you as soon as I can. I know you're good for it, but I'm having a tough month. - Try your best, please, Cam? - I know. I will. Thank you. - Yeah? - You coming in today or not? What are you... what are you talking about? Do you not remember? What do you want me to do with your new bike, then? What new bike? The one your girlfriend dropped off for you this morning. I don't have a girlfriend. - Hey! - What do you want? - To... to say thank you. - For what? What do you mean for what? For the bike you got me. You're welcome. Do you... How did you learn how to do parkour? What, did I say it wrong? - I gotta go. - Wait, what's your name? - Do you ride? - No. A bike's a ball and chain. Oh, yeah? All right. Well, you know, anybody can... hop up and climb this thing. I'd like to see that. All right. You got it. Maybe you should stick to the bike. Screw it. I'm Cam. Nikki. You want to show me something else? - You gotta learn how to see. - I can see just fine. If you want to vault the car, don't look at the car, look where the car isn't. Okay. Whoa, hey! How did you get over there? Nice to meet you, Cam. Who are you? - What are you doing here, Dylan? - I'm just looking out for you, Nicks. So what, you're just spying on me the whole time? - You working out alone? - So what? So you gotta be careful. That's all I'm saying. You gotta stay off my ass, Dyl. Who is this guy? He's nobody. Haven't seen you around. - I haven't been around. - Where'd you find him? He found me. You following her? No, no. Just saw her in the park. You know this is dangerous stuff. You get hurt if you don't know what you're doing. Let's bounce. Wonderful. Well, some of this stuff is kinda beat up, but... I'll give you 450. Look, my rent's $550. Can you go there? One, two, three, four, five, fifty. Thanks. Thanks a lot. How much for the muscle car, kid? It was my Dad's. - I'm gonna have to hold onto it. - Too bad, nice car. Hey, Cam! - You saw that, mom? - Yeah, I did, baby. Come on... Joey! It's not much to look at, but... okay. Better watch the potholes this time, all right? Hey, buddy. Looks like somebody's been practicing. - You should come work out with us. - I never see you guys around. We're a tight group. We like to keep to ourselves. Loujaine floating terminal in Brooklyn. You know it? No. Pier 62. Gowanus Bay. I'll see you at dawn. All right. Hey, guys. I'm Dylan. This is Tate, Jax. - How's it going? - Cam. - What's up? - This is my sister Nikki. We already met. This is awesome. What are we supposed to do? Try and keep up. Holy shit! He's dead, dude. Hey, there. You must be Cam. Dylan tells me you're new to parkour. He also said you're pretty good. Might have to... work on this jump though. I'm Miller. Pick a fight with gravity before you're ready, you tend to get a beating. I don't know what I'm doing. That's the great thing about parkour, my friend. There are no rules. You all right? I'm good. Just trying to keep up. Cam. Is that short for Camaro? Shut... You have a learning disability, dude. Excuse him. - Where you from? - Queens. - Play any sports in high school? - Nah, I barely went. I tried baseball once, did some martial arts. Yeah, I wasn't much of a jock in high school either. Look at you. Hello. Where'd you do your time? It's okay. You're not the only one in here with a record. - Abbot House. Hillside. - Juvi. Yeah. Did six months in Otisville a couple years ago. Oh, shit, what for? B & E. Boosting cars. Just bullshit stuff. You ever go in hard? Pull some hold ups? No. I didn't want to go that way. Right. So, what'd you do for money? I'm a bike messenger. Fifty points for the bike messenger. What do you guys deliver? Documents. Just business stuff. At least, that's what they tell you. I don't know. I mean, they hand me a package, I drop it off. - Sure, but it could be anything, right? - I guess. You never look inside the bag? No. Never? - No. Why would I do that? - Just curiosity. - It's none of my business. - But you're the one carrying the package. Look, as long as after I drop it off they pay me my money, I don't really care what's inside the bag. So what do you guys do? We do whatever we can not to get caught. That looks like fun. They are no limits, my friend. Only plateaus. Plateaus? You've got to constantly push past what you think you can do or you stay stuck. I like that one. What else you got? Well, how about this? This whole thing, parkour, free running, tracing... whatever you want to call it, is just a state of mind. Now the real obstacles are not out there. They're in your head. Okay? I don't know. Those obstacles look pretty real to me. Well, you're gonna have to start seeing 'em differently. Got it. So look where the car isn't. Exactly. - So... how's that new bike treating you? - It's good. Thanks again. - Where is it? - I... left it at home today. Liar. Somebody clipped it. I didn't want to say anything. It's all good. I get it. You're one of those kind of people. What kind of people is that? Can't hang on to anything nice. I guess I haven't had enough practice. Don't worry about it. I should've known better. I mean... Next time I'll just take my wallet and burn it. Hey, Niks! Let's go! You guys all work together? See you around, Cam. Good to meet you, Cam. Don't let these guys get you in trouble. Oh, shit! Excuse me, is Jerry here? Back there? Okay. - Excuse me, Sir. Is Jerry here? - You just missed him. - Do you know when he'll be back? - When he returns. Okay. Hey! - What are you doing? - Hey, Cam. You didn't tell us you had such a sweet ride, man. I have your cash, right here! Here. - There you go, take it. - All right, man. We're taking five grand off your tab for the car, but you got one month to get us the rest, all right? How am I supposed to get 10 grand in a month, Jerry?! - Not my problem, Cam. - Jerry, cut me some slack, come on. You still don't understand how this works, do you? If you don't pay, we don't shoot you. You got one month, Cam. - Go inside the house, Joey. Now. - Joey. Hey, Angie, I'm sorry. Your friends gave Joey a ride home from school today, Cam. Those assholes brought my son home from school. I don't know what you're involved in, and I don't want to know. Stay away from us. I mean it. Hey, look who's here. - Hey, what's up, buddy? - Are you okay? I want in. You are in. We don't just let anybody train with us. No, I'm talking about work. Whatever you guys got going on I want in on it. What's your problem? What do you guys think, I'm a narc or something? Come on. Hey, Dylan. I need to talk to Miller. Hook me up. No, it's a bad idea. Why, you know something I don't? We're in the transport business, Cam. We move valuables. People hire us to make obstacles go away, change hands, land on someone else. The difference is I provide assurances that other people can't. I guarantee the work. You want some evidence to disappear? We can take of that for you. It's a profession. We're not thrill seekers who pull any score that comes along. The key is speed and silence. In and out, fast and quiet. We do our research. Plan every move. Work as a team. Everyone knows their job. Documents, chemicals, technology. Anything. We don't take sides. Now I got just two rules. The first is, if you get in trouble, I'm your first call. The second, you stay out of Chinatown. - Even if you're not on a job. - Why is that? I'm inviting you to sit down at the dinner table. Show me you know how to be a good guest. Nice work. Dyl! Turn around! - Hold on! Don't move! - I'm not. - Shut up! Shut up! - I'm not moving! Who do you work for? I said, who do you work for? - Answer his question! - No one! What's in the bag? Tell me what's in the bag! - I don't know what's in the bag. - Give it to me! - No! - Give it to me! Give me the bag! You tell me what's in that bag! You tell me what's in that bag or I'm gonna blow your brains out right now! - I swear to God! What is in the bag! - I just carry the bag! Good work, Cam. What... what's going on? You pulled some serious moves out there, pal. - Dude, we heard about the bus. That was sick! - And you, sir, you were hauling ass! Hey, it's all right, buddy. We just had to make sure you had our backs. You're family now. What do you think? I think you're a bunch of assholes. Especially you. - Hey. - Hey. Where you taking me? All right. - Where are the others? - They're busy. Well... you want to grab a coffee or something? This isn't a date. I didn't... I didn't mean it like a date. Let's just get this done, okay? So how long have you been working for Miller? - A few years. - Did you grow up in the city? No. Where'd you learn how to do parkour? Here. - You still live with Dylan? - Okay, enough with the questions, okay? - I'm just trying to make conversation. - Yeah, but you wanted to be in. Guess what? You're in. There's nothing left to discuss. - What's your deal? - My deal? - Yeah, what's your deal? - I don't have a deal. - Then why are you acting like this? - There is no deal. Acting like what? I don't know. I just thought we could... I didn't ask you to come find me. Really? You sure about that? You did give me that bike... I'm gonna tell Miller you can work on your own next time. You don't need a babysitter. Okay. - This the new guy? - Yeah. Good luck, new guy. Dylan. Jax. Nikki. Tate. Employee of the month, Cam. Angie? What are you doing here, Cam? I'm working. I know. I brought your rent money. I don't care what you brought. I told you to leave us alone, right? Angie... Angie, please. Hey, hey. Please take it. Okay? It'll hold you over until you find somebody else to move in. This is too much. What kind of trouble are you in? My mom got sick after she lost her job. So I borrowed some money off the street to try and help her keep the house. It wasn't enough. So the bank foreclosed on her a week before she died. You got a good heart, Cam, but you got to be careful. Further you go down the wrong road, the harder it gets to find your way back. I gotta get back to work. Wait, one sec. One sec. Can you give this to Joey? You don't have to tell him it's from me. I'm sorry for everything. I really am. I won't bother you guys again, I promise. Hey. What do you think, man? Factory paint, marine grey. 14 inch rally wheels. You got something for us? That's not even two grand here, man. I need 10. Give me a few more weeks I'll get it to you. - Well, that's past the deadline, Cam. - I was hoping we could renegotiate. Look, I got a new job. You can raise the vig if you want to... You're still acting like I'm the boss, Cam. I'm not, all right? Chen is the boss. The money you owe me, I own Chen! You put me in a tight spot here, Cam. Now I don't want to see anything happen to your friend and her little boy, but... you don't make this right, it will. Those are the rules. Two weeks, Cam. 10 grand. Yeah? We're going out tonight. Want to come? - Work? - More like play. Can I get a water? Hey, what happened here? - This? - Yeah. - I biffed a wall trick. - Oh, how's the wall? Check this out. Got it on a broken rail. That's nothing man. Check this out. Razor wire. Dylan, why don't you show them what happened right here? - Is that from a curb? - Nah. It was a older lady. He loves the cougar's. Yeah. She was a nice girl. She was Chinese. She was real smart. I met her on the subway. Whatever, whatever. I see her walking down the street one night with this guy. I assume it must be her cousin or something. So I go up to her, I give her a big hug and a kiss. And she freaks out. Like she's never seen me before. Goes totally ape shit. Turns out her cuz' was her husband. Yeah, husband, mixed-martial artist. Bad news for the lady killer. Is that why we can't cut though Chinatown? No, that's all Miller, man. He's got bad blood with the gangs there. - What, the Tongs? - Yeah. Yeah, some business went south. He had to cut a deal, promise to stay away. - You know, Nikki's got some cute marks. - Hey, hey. I don't know what he's talking about. It's not happening. - If I show you, I'd have to kill ya. - He said it. There she is! The future Mrs. Jackson Smith. Right there. - Oh, yeah? - That's gonna be my future ex-wife. Yeah, we're gonna move to the countryside. Make lots of sweet ginger babies every night of the week. - Oh, that's a terrible visual! - Then rest of our lives. I know, you're jealous. You guys know nothing about women. Hey. Hey, hey. What happened? Nothing. It's just stuffy as hell in there. That's all. Do you wanna... do you wanna get out of here? You want to go somewhere else? - Not right now. No, I can't. - Hey, what's wrong with you? Nikki, what are you afraid of? Hey, guys. Sorry I missed the fun. I had some business to take care of. Yeah. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, Cam. If you need anything at all, call me. All right? - All right? - Yeah. Coming back in? No, I'm tired. I'm... gonna hit it. Hey. What are you doing here? Wanted to talk to you. How did you find me? Why are you living on the roof? Why didn't you tell me you were with Miller? Dylan got into some trouble. And Miller made it go away. So your brother pimped you out to the boss. - Sounds pretty simple to me. - Miller doesn't own me. Is that right? Why are you here? What's the point? I should have told you. It's my fault, but... - Cam you wouldn't even be here if I... - So you want me to quit? - You can still walk. - Is that what you want? I don't want you to owe Miller like we do! Do you want me to go? No... I heard once tattoo's are like scars that you wear on the outside to show the pain that's on the inside. Is that true? I don't know. Why don't you have any? 'Cause I don't want anyone to know. I owe people money, Nikki. And as soon as I pay them off... I'm gone. And this moment was brought to you by the sounds of summer in New York City. Yeah, we're in a over-crowded prison. - I don't really mind it. - No? No. I mean, before I left Florida, I'd never even seen a town bigger than 500 people. Well, you're lucky, 'cause all I've ever seen is this jungle. You've never been outside the city? No. I mean, I don't count my jail time. I tried to leave. When? After my mom died. When she passed away, I found out that... she had my dad's old car. And she never told me while she was alive, 'cause she was afraid if I found out I'd sell it to try and help her out. So... she kept it a secret. She wrote me a letter. She said she wanted me to fix it up, get it running again. Just hop in and drive. Somewhere... I don't know where, far away. California maybe. That was the plan. Well, where's the car now? The... - the bank took it. - The bank? I guess I'm just one of those people who can never hold onto anything nice. I'll agree with that. Where you been, baby? I went for a walk. Anything wrong? No. Nothing, you know I just... get nervous before the big jobs. That's all. Sure that's all? You seem kind of distant. Yeah. Like you're somewhere else. No. Right here, James. I don't know what I'd do without you. You know that? I'm just tired. I gotta go to bed. Sure. He's getting better. Nikki and I were living on the streets when we found parkour. We got hooked. It was like being kids again. The whole city is our playground. Is that where you met Miller? Yeah. Miller raised us. Taught us everything we knew, got us off the streets. We'd be nowhere without him. Yeah, Nikki said that she got you out of some sort of trouble or something. - Nikki said that? - Yeah. What'd she tell you, exactly? I mean, nothing specifically. Just... that you got in some sort of trouble. And he made it go away. But she really cares about you. She doesn't want to see you get hurt. Are you in some sort of trouble, Cam? 'Cause if you are, and Miller finds out, it's not just you. That's trouble for all of us. And he always finds out. No. I'm all good. Good. I got the last one. Unit 17 code... All clear, good job. That's how we do it! - Wait. - I'll catch up with you later? Sure. Talk later. What do you mean? Where's our money? Payday is next week, Cam, same as usual. - Okay, when's the next gig happening? - Soon. Hey, you did a good job. Get some rest. You don't understand. I need that money. Do we have a problem? No. No. No problem. I've got a big job coming up next week. It's worth 15, 20 grand each at least. Does that work for you guys? - Sweet. Sounds good. - Yeah. How about you, Cam? Work for you? Yeah, that works. Good. You look just like your dad. Yeah, I get that a lot. It's a nice... constant reminder of the amazing father he was. Well, if it's any consolation, my dad wasn't exactly a real winner either. Sometimes it's better not to know. Yeah. You're just going to leave, aren't you? You should come with me. - Yeah, right. - Why "yeah, right"? - I can't. - Why not? It's complicated. Well... I'm not going anywhere without wheels. Hold on to this for me. Thank you. Nice spot. I can see all the way into the future from up here. Yeah, what happened to staying in the moment? You're a good student, Cam. Now you're moving beyond what you've been taught. Beyond the rules, but outside there's a natural order to things. You know, there can be only one alpha for every pack. And that my friend, I learned the hard way. A long time ago. In the back of a Chinese restaurant, trying to beg for my life with a gun in my mouth. Is there something you need to tell me, Cam? There's nothing. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. You should get some plants up here. Liven this place up a bit. Pickup tomorrow at 9:30. Hey, guys. Where's Nikki? Gave her the day off. Two minutes. You'll be needing this. Wait, we're going in strong? I told you it was big, my friend. - You're gonna get a cut. - Twenty grand each. Maybe more. I didn't sign up for this. Okay, it's up here on the corner. We're doing a bank? Old bank. New money. BTK bought it. - BTK? - Vietnamese bangers. This is their laundromat. They keep a big stack, couple hundred K. - How do you know all this? - That's my job. How we getting in this thing? The front door. What? You're risking a lot here, man. Tell your man to make this look good. Okay, game time. Who's got my piece? You're carrying the package. You'll be all right. We've done this before. We don't even shoot these things. Be safe, kids, stay out of trouble. Masks! Hand off the gun! Toss him the gun! Toss him the gun! You deaf? Toss him the gun! You don't like to listen? Get on the ground! You think this is funny? You think this is a game? Get on the ground! You deaf? Get on the floor! We got to get moving, guys! What... what's the combination?! Answer him! Tell me how we get inside! You think this is funny?! Tell me what the combo is! What, is everybody deaf and dumb here? Answer his question! What's the combination?! I don't have it. Is there another way in? Yo, come on! I can get in. - What the hell are you doing? - I can't see shit with this thing! - We got to move, guys! - There's nothing. It's empty! - With nothing! - Check again! - Where's the money?! - I don't know, dude. I don't know. - What are you laughing at, big guy?! - They picked it up early. But he wouldn't have known that. Would you? Would you? - Dude, let's just go! - You're dead. Back up! Where you going, little bitch? Go! Go! Go! You better run! Come on! Come on! Come on! Back! Back! Back! Come on! Come on! Freeze! Stay down! Put your hands up where I can see them, now! Stay right there, get down! How about your dead buddy, Does he got a name? I don't know, might be nice to let his family know where to pick up his remains. He doesn't have any family. What the hell did you do to get half the BTK to chase your little asses down the street? Look, if you had anything real to charge me with you wouldn't be asking. The Feds would like a word with you. Have fun, kid. - Miller? - No sudden moves, okay? - What are you doing? - I'm James Hatcher. I'm with the DEA. You thought jumping a 20-foot gap, five stories up was a rush? - What the hell are you talking about? - Just breathe for me, Cam, okay? We don't have much time. Hey, where's Dylan and Tate? They're in the van on the way home. They should be hitting the tunnel by now. - Do they know about this? - Cam, they all know. How the hell do you think I ran this circus? Miller's a man on the ground, shipping and receiving, HR, transpo. Hatcher's upstairs... due diligence, client relations, new business. Neither one of them gets much sleep, but they work well together. You got to be kidding me. I've been working for a dirty Fed this whole time? Yeah, or a clean criminal. Depends on your point of view. What about Jax? Look, I got bad intel on this one, okay, and Jax is gone. But that's the past. All we have is the moment. And right now, in this moment, New York P.D. thinks you're one of my CI's. That means you get to walk out of here with me, right now, under my protection. Yeah, so they can find my body in a dumpster tomorrow morning? No, thank you! Cam, I'm not going to hurt you. I need your help. The cops are rousting the whole gang. Sooner or later someone is going to talk themselves out of trouble and that will lead back to me. It's time for me to cash out. Is this your "one last score" speech? Save it. It's my exit plan. But I cannot do it without your help. If you want me, I need my 10 grand, today. Right now. - Then we'll talk. - That's not going to happen. Fine. Then I'm not helping you. All right? I'm out. The thing is, Cam, it's not just about you anymore, is it? Because you became part of a family, so you have to think about the welfare of others. Where is she? I don't want Nikki mixed up in this anymore. So you and I are going to finish this. Hey! Why didn't you tell me? - I told you to get out. - You played me from the start. - No. - The bike, that was all bullshit? - No. - This has been a set-up the whole time? - Cam, I swear it. That was all me! - Yeah, right! I felt bad for wrecking you out. I wanted to get you a new one. I didn't think all of this was going to happen. Well, then, what did you think? - You wanted in, Cam. - No. I wanted you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. I did! But I... I couldn't. Why not? - Because of Dylan. - What do you mean because of Dylan? What did Dylan do that's so bad that you couldn't tell me this whole time? He... You know, Dylan is your older brother, Nikki. You don't need to babysit him. You can let him deal with his own problems. Somebody did something to me, okay. Back in Florida. Some scumbag came into my bedroom late at night. He started touching me. Dylan walked in and he beat him into a coma. The cops came after us. They chased us all the way over here. And then I met Miller. And Miller made it all go away. Dylan was there that night to protect me. And now it's my job to protect him. Cam, I was scared to tell you anything else, because... Because I didn't want you to go. Look... if I can get us a clean exit tomorrow... will you come with me? Miller's not going to let us just walk away. Do you wanna leave Miller or not, Nikki? I told you what could happen to Dylan, to us, if anything ever went wrong. Do you remember? - Yeah. - What? Yes! I'm getting us out of this life. And we're going to start over. Just you and me this time. Okay? Where we going? The guys and I got a plane to catch when we're done. We'll drop you on the way to the airport. After you get your 10 grand, of course. Here. Put these on. Let's go. Nikki and Tate will lookout while we make the pickup, okay. - Where are we? - Safe house. Russians keep their VIP's here, they stash other stuff too. - Well, what do you need me for? - It's a two-man job. - Why can't Dylan go in... - Dylan's watching our exit. How are we getting in? Through the skylight? Copy that. - What's inside there? - New plateau, my friend. It's not loaded. You want me to go in unarmed? I'm going in with you. It's you and me together this time. All right? You're really down with this, Dylan? How about you just do your job, all right? Hey, get your head in it, Cam. Right now. We're doing this for Nikki. Remember? - Pull over. - Why? 'Cause I gotta take a piss. Tate! Come on! - I can't. - What? Come on, Nikki. Everybody knows about you and Cam. - Stop the van, Tate. - No. - Pull over! - Just shut up already! Pull the fuck over! Once you're inside, just do everything I say. I've got this all worked out. Sure landing. On three. Ready? One, two, three. Be quiet! Don't move! Don't move! Sit! Sit down! - What's going on! - Watch them! Don't move! What's the exit plan?! This is the exit plan, Cam. - Dylan, what are you doing! - Don't... don't move! Do it! He's got the diamonds! - Dylan... Dylan, put the gun down! - Don't move! All units, 10-10. Shots fired at 231 West 23rd. Repeat, shots fired. - DEA, I'm taking your car! - No! Nikki! Nikki, are you okay?! Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm okay. - Okay. Come on, come on, come on. Come on! This way! No, no, no! I'm done! Move away, Nikki, I don't want to hurt you! I'm not going to ask you again, baby. Move away. Agent Hatcher. - Chen? - James... Okay, listen. I can explain. There's been a mistake. There has. You made it. Yeah, I believe it was rule number two. Stay out of Chinatown. - You son a bitch! - Watch your language. You're in Chen's house now. I told you long time ago to keep your business out of my neighborhood. And I did, Chen, I did. But this is personal. So is this. You've been making too much trouble for too many of my friends. Okay. Chen, listen to me... There is a boat leaving for Macau in two hours. Mr. Hu will make sure you're on it. Time to close you out. You're dead, both of you. You're dead. But enough about him. You have something for me? If I were you, I'd seriously consider leaving town. Congratulations. Your debt is clear. That's it? We're all done. Wait. What about our deal? - Where to? - Let's just drive.
