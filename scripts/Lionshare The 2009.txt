That's... yeah... totally. l mean if you would have been wearing a pop collar l would have been out of here, also. Eva.. But, yeah, that's the extent of my internet dating...dating. Eva.. You're a filmmaker, yes? Sory, l was tying to remember your profile. Nick.. l ty to make films. Basically, l have been working on this one thing for like two years Nick.. and l'm like totally stuck with it though so l am all like stressed and cranky about it. Eva.. What's it about? You so don't want to talk about it. Nick.. Aside from that, much less stressful project l'm working on is this music video for my friend's band. Eva.. Cool. Nick.. Yeah. Nick.. Okay. Here's my stock question.. What kind of music do you like? Nick.. What? Eva.. That is so lame. That's lamer than... Nick.. You just asked me what l do. Eva.. You made fun of me for ''what do you do.'' How is... so lame. Nick.. l didn't make fun of you that much. Eva.. Eva, wherever l am. Two? Do l have two? Nick.. One. Eva.. One? Whatever, l get a point for that. Nick.. Whatever. Eva.. Anyway... l could start listing bands but you're not going to know any of them. Nick.. What? How do you know that? Nick.. l might know more about bands thank you've like... Eva.. It's just a hard way to answer a question. It's a stupid question. Nick.. Okay... Nick.. What's the last thing you listened to? Eva.. Ohhh...okay...have you ever heard of this band 'applecury'? Nick.. Yeah, totally. Eva.. Really? Nick.. No, l totally haven't. Eva.. Oh my god l would have been so excited, they're so good. Nick.. Sory. Eva.. So applecury... Eva.....you just broke my hearrt. l was like ''Oh my god he's heard of them.'' Nick.. No but now there's this opporrtunity for you to share that with someone. Eva.. Absolutely. They're like a...what do you call it... Eva.. Actually, are you on The Lionshare? Or have you heard of it? Nick.. The Lionshare? No, l'm not on it and l haven't heard of it; both those things. Eva.. Well it's like a bit torrent site, you download like movies and music and stuff. Nick.. Yeah, l know what you're talking about. Eva.. You have to be invited though. So if you give me your e-mail l could invite you. Nick.. Oh, that's tricky. l don't know if l want to do that. Eva.. Why? Nick.. l don't know if we're at that level yet. Where l could just give you my e-mail. Eva.. Fine. Nick.. l'm kidding... Eva.. Then you'll never hear about applecury again. Nick.. Nick, my name. O, as in the letter. Eva.. Got it. Nick.. And rette, like nick-o-rette, like the gum. R-E-T-T-E. Eva.. Why the gum? Nick.. l don't know, l like gum. Eva.. So, l'm going to going to send you my last invite Eva.. and you have to download applecury. Nick.. l will. l will, why wouldn't l do that? That's why l was like ''Oh l want to check that out.'' Eva.. Well, what if you forget who they are? Nick.. Okay. Eva.. applecury is the name of the band. Sory does that hurrt? Nick.. No, it tickles a little bit. Is there anything else you want to put down there? Eva.. Favorite color? Nick.. Yeah, l mean, just write your whole profile so l can look at it whenever l want. Nick.. Okay, cool. Eva.. Awesome. Nick.. Thanks. Eva.. So, how long have you known you wanted to be a filmmaker? Eva.. l'm just curious because like l still don't know what l want to do. Nick.. Totally yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nick.. l don't know, ummm... Nick.. We had my dad's big clunky VHS camera. Like it was bigger than us. l feel like evey family had these. Eva.. Yeah we totally did. Nick.. And we decided to re-make Ghostbusters. Eva.. Cool. Nick.. Yeah, it was totally awesome. Nick.. It was weird because all my friends were really into the whole pretending and Nick.. being in the movie thing but l like really enjoyed being behind the camera. Eva.. Uh-huh. Nick.. And that was something l knew l liked more than what they were doing so l always ended up being there. Eva.. That's so awesome. Nick.. l guess. l mean, yeah. Eva.....l've never seen Ghostbusters. Nick.. What? Really? Eva.. Yeah. l mean, like, there's plenty of things l haven't seen but l've not seen Ghostbusters. Nick.. And Ghostbusters is one of them? Nick.. All right. That...l can't...all right. That needs to be rectified immediately. Like now. Eva.. l think l'd rather see your version of Ghostbusters. Nick.. This is -- this is -- this is way bigger than just me. Eva.. It was a carrtoon though too, right? Nick.. Yeah it was a carrtoon, but you haven't seen the movie? Nick.. We need to watch Ghostbusters right now. Like, for real. l don't know. Eva.. There is a Blockbuster on the way to my house. Nick.. Is there? Eva.. Just throwing it out there. Nick.. They might in fact have a copy of Ghostbusters that we could then watch at your house. Nick.. And...they don't have it. Eva.. Seriously? Nick.. Seriously. Eva.. Where are you even looking? Nick.. They have it, but... Eva.. Ohhh and it was the Collector's Series too. Should we ask? Maybe they have it like in the back. Nick.. Yeah. Eva.. Do they have a back or... Nick.. l mean, they might have it in the front. Nick.. l don't know maybe they have it at like... l don't know.

No yeah, you don't remember when l was a contestant on the show? Nick.. Yeah, can't believe l didn't remember that. Matty..

So l starrted watching Project Wunway. Matty.. Project WUNway. Project RUN...way. Matty.. l starrted watching Project RUNway. Matty.. But yeah, she has all these shows she needs to watch so l watch them. Matty.. l mean it's like, l have no shows l need to watch. Nick.. l'm like the complete opposite of that. l'm even worse than her l need to watch Nick.. pretty much everything. Not necessarily Project Runway, but you know what l mean. Matty.. Yeah it's true, l mean, l did get into Lost because of you. Nick.. Yeah. Matty.. That's what happens to me, l get into shows because of other people. Nick..

But if you go over here it looks like it's dripping blood. Girl.. Oh... Matty.. l wonder who goes about that. Is it sorrt of like some guy who owns the place Matty.. has his friends decorate it or is it just people do it and then... Girl.. So l recently starrted Netti-Potting... Matty.. l think you're too caught up in the content, you know? Matty.. l mean like eveybody that people think did totally original stuff was just ripping on someone else. You know? Nick.. That's true. Matty.. l mean Kurrt Cobain said when he made ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' Matty.. He was basically tying to make a really good Pixies song. Nick.. Right, yeah. Totally. l never heard that but l can see that. Nick.. l'm sure like when The Pixies were making their songs they were like Nick.. ''Oh let's make a really great Talking Heads song.'' Matty.. They had that flyer out for their bassist and it was like someone that has Matty.. the influences of Peter Paul & May and Husker Du. And that's how the bassist joined the band. Nick.. The Pixies? Matty.. Yeah. Nick.. That's crazy. Isn't the bassist the girl? Matty.. Uh-huh. Kim Deal. Nick.. That's crazy. Bracey.. l don't know a Marty pUppy what's a Marrty-puppy? Bracey..

He wanted to go see, you know the new Bond movie? But... Matty.....he kind of blew me off the first time. So, when he wanted to go see it again, l blew him off and l kind of feel like a dick about it. Jane.. Why? Matty.. l don't know. l mean, it's kind of like this old tradition -- l can't find the thing, by the way, for this. l'm looking for my thing. Jane.. This is your house. Jane.. You're not...well, you are a dick, but you're not being a dick right now. Matty.. You sure? Jane.. Yes. You're not a dick. Matty.. Thanks. Jane.. You're welcome. Matty.. You should put a little more.

Yeah. l mean, it gives you -- it definitely gives you a sense of purpose. Nick.. Right. That's what you're paying for. Jane.. Yeah, eXactly. My thousands of dollars... Jane.. But yeah like, l have to pay like over $700 in textbooks. Jane.. Where -- l don't have $700 for textbooks. Nick.. Right. Because you already gave them like thousands of dollars... Jane.. Right, l already gave them my soul, l signed that away. Nick.. Yeah, right. Jane.. It didn't cover textbooks though. Nick.. That's ridiculous, you're already paying them to like, spend that time to give you all that information. Jane.. l know, it's like... Nick.. The education, that's what you're paying for. Jane.. Right, eXactly, it's like, give me the fucking books, Jane.....you owe me that, and then l will Iearn. Nick.. Yeah. Jane.. Yeah, it's really backwards. Nick.. It's ass-backwards. Jane.. It is ass-backwards. But l don't like to think about that on the weekends. This is my relaxing time. This is Jane time. Nick.. This is Jane time, okay. Jane.. Yes. This is my Jane time. Nick..

Nick.. Yeah, totally. The Matt signal. l get those all the time. Jane.. Right, yeah. Nick.. He's like, ''l have this song that l want to put out on YouTube and MySpace and stuff just to get more stuff out there...'' Nick.. and so he was like, ''Oh, you know, if you could video...'' So l was like, ''All right, yeah, sure. Of course.'' Jane.. That's cool. Nick.. Yeah l guess, l haven't really like worked on it all. Like l have like no ideas for it whatsoever, but... Jane.. l mean, l'm sure you're gonna think of something. Nick.. Hopefully. Jane.. Like, l've always thought your stuff was really awesome. Nick.. Oh, well thanks. Sure. Jane.. Yeah no like when we were in school l was always really really impressed. Nick.. Okay, yeah, sure. l -- l'm like, ''Oh, great,'' l can't like... Jane.. l mean, you know that though. You know that. Nick.. You know... l don't know. You know how it is, like, with me. l'm just like, ''Ahhh l don't know.'' Matty.. Food's ready kids. Nick.. What the fuck? Jane.. Too much. Too much. Too much. Nick..

You do that shit all the time. Matty.. Yeah, well, l mean, it's usuallyjust stupid shit, l can't just will it out of nowhere... Matty.....when it's something imporrtant, you know? For you it would be imporrtant. Jane.. l'm skeptical. Jane.. Are you mad at me? Matty.. A little bit. Jane.. Why? Matty.. You said my cum tastes funny. Jane.. Bear fact. Matty.. Fuck you. Bear fucking fact... Nick.. You guys really got to stop with that or l'm going to kill myself. Jane.. Aww. ''You guys have to stop doing that before l kill myself.'' Matty.. Fuck this. We're gonna do a blind taste test. Nick, l want you to beat off into a cup and we'll do a Pepsi challenge. See what she says. Nick.. Uhh, l kind of already did that, so... l was waiting for you to ask. Matty.. Oh, really? Nick.. Yeah. l mean it's been here for awhile though...

Matty.. We've been roommates for a long time, it's only been a matter of time. Jane.. l don't even know what that means. Matty.. It means-- Nick.. --we've been doing these taste tests for a long time. Matty.. That's eXactly what it means. Jane.. That was the one thing l was hoping it didn't mean. Jane.. Hey. What are you doing out here? Nick.. Uhh, l didn't really want to, you know, smoke in the aparrtment while you were there. Jane.. Really? Nick.. Yeah. Jane.. That's so sweet. Nick.. Yeah, l guess. l don't know. Yeah, that's me. Jane.. That is you. Jane.. Can you, like, drink out here? Is that okay or is it like public consumption or something? Nick.. What? What do you mean? Jane.. l don't know, that sounds stupid, l don't know. Like, can you do that? Jane.. What was that? Nick.. l just got dive-bombed by a moth or something. Jane.. Monster? Nick.. Actually that looks like a monster bee. Nick.. It's night-time, you're not supposed to be here. Nick.. Oh my god it's right there. Jane.. Oh jesus. Nick.. All right hold on. Jane.. This is really not giving you points in the masculinity deparrtment right now. Jane.. Don't step on it! Nick.. Oh, no. l'd rather have it like stab me. Jane.. l'm going to go get my drink, l'll be right back. Nick.. Sure. Jane.. Okay. Nick.. That was quick. Jane.. That's much better. Nick.. Sure. Jane.. Are my teeth stained? Nick..

Those things can do eveyrything. Eva.. Blow dy your hair with it. Nick.. Blow dy your hair...cheese grater... Nick.....snow shoes... Matty.. Evey time l ty to get out, they pull me back in. Fredo! Fredo! Eva.. What is that from? Matty.. It's from The Godfathers. It's one of those moving pictures. You know, like that sexy one. Bracey.. Two seniors for Sarica Jessica Parker's ''Sexy Town'' please. Matty.. l work at a movie theater, and you ever notice when old people come in Matty.. theyjust never remember the title of the movie they want to see? Eva.. Mm-hmm. Matty.. Well, l've kind of whittled it down to a couple of basic rules. Matty.. First off, if the word ''the'' is in front of a title, theyjust totally omit it. Or they add it if it isn't there. Matty.. They also do this thing where they pluralize and de-pluralize movies. Matty.. So ''Transformers'' ends up becoming like Matty.. ''Five seniors for 'The Transformer'.'' You know? ''And a pickle.'' Bracey.. ''l Transform.'' Matty.. ''l Transform.'' Matty.. This woman come in once and she was like ''Give me three seniors for 'Failure to Launch'.'' Matty.. And there's no movie even close to that title on the marquee. Matty.. Oh, l fucked it up. Nick.. You said 'Failure to Launch'... Nick.....and that's what it was. Matty.. It was 'Failure to Launch'. Matty.. Yeah. She asked for 'Full Throttle', l'm sory. But she was like Matty.. ''Yeah give me one for 'Full Throttle'.'' So she went from 'Failure to Launch' to 'Full Throttle' somehow. Matty.. l don't know how. Eva.. They both have to do with, like, flying. Bracey.. Throttling....you like throttling. Matty.. Dude. Matty.. All right, so give me a title, l'll give you an eXample. Name a movie. Eva.. Okay, umm... Eva.....Ghostbusters. Bracey.. Two seniors for... 'The Great Ghost Bust'. Eva.. That's breaking the rules. You're not following the rules. Matty.. Once you know the rules you can do whatever you want, you know? Matty.. It's like jazz. You have a foundation and you just keep going from there. Bracey.. You feel your way through it. Eva.. That's awesome. They totally do that. Matty.. Yeah it's true. Eva.. It's like -- what's that thing you say? It's like a total -- it's like a polar bear fact. Bracey.. That's cute. Nick.. Shut up. Nick.. It's Bear Fact. Eva.. Bear fact. Nick.. Yeah. Nick.. You can't have that joke; that's my joke. It's not yours. Bracey.. All right... Matty.. l think that was myjoke anyway. Bracey.. l kind of thought it was a communal thing. Matty.. Hey baby boy. Matty.. Coffee's up if you want it. Nick.. Thanks. Matty.. l see you had a long night last night. Nick.. Yeah, it was pretty long. Matty.. Yeah. What'd you think of Bracey's new girlfriend? Nick.. She's nice. Matty.. Yeah. Slammin' body. Matty.. Hey did you happen to download Lost? Matty.. You're my man with the hook-ups SOn. Nick.. Fuck. Matty.. What? Matty.. This site has been closed for... Fuck. That sucks. Nick.. Yeah...you just knew it was going to end this way though. Matty.. Well, come on man, we'll make our own. We'll call it The Bear Share. Nick.. Bear's don't share. Matty.. Sure they do. Nick.. No they don't. They don't share. Matty.. Yes they do...all right, well what do they do? Lions share... Nick.. They mate. Bears mate. Matty.. Bears mate? Okay... Nick.. l'm not a bear anymore. Matty.. You're always a bear, man. Matty.. Well let's see, lions share, bear...facts. We got tiger...beats? Matty.. Hey. l just wrote you a song.
