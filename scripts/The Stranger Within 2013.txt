I'm not asking you as your agent. Ooh. Well, then, I feel great. Um, the baby's fine and Robert's busy and... Good. You starting to show yet? I don't know. You tell me. Ha-ha-ha. What are we doing here? You got any parts for a fat lady? Ha, ha. What's the deal? What, I need a reason to see you? Well, you did bring me out of rehearsals on opening night. It better be good. No. Don't. Michael. No, it's, uh... Never mind. Michael. No, it's nothing. It's nothing. Good luck tonight. He was just acting really weird is all. Emily, the guy has had a crush on you since he got you your first movie in high school. Jealous? Right. Focus on your outfit, would you? Oh, the shrink is jealous. You like this dress? No. Heh. What about... this one? Not really. What about... this one? Yeah? Mm. You like that better? A little bit. - You look great. - Thank you. - Were you nervous? - I was. I was nervous at the beginning especially, but then I kind of got into a groove and it... That's great. Yeah. Mm. Mm. So, so proud of you, kiddo. Thank you. Hey, did Michael ever turn up? No. No, he didn't, and he's never missed a premiere before, so I think I'm gonna give him a call. Be right back. Okay. Hi, this is Michael, I'm not in. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you. Hi, Michael, it's me. Um... Call me when you get the chance. I'm hoping you're all right. Okay. Bye. Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, but it's for my daughter. She's such a fan of yours. And she's got cancer. Oh, I'm sorry. Of course. Thank you. Here you go. Thank you so much. It's my pleasure. It's a patient. Could you hold a moment? Thank you. I'm so sorry. Okay, but I'm taking the car, and you owe me. Big time. Get out of here. Love you. Hi, this is Michael, I'm not in. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. What's going on with you? It's not like you to not show up. Anyway, for what's it's worth, I missed you this evening. Bye. Sophie? I know about Sophie. And I'm gonna punish you for it. All clear. Moving to Section 3. No sign of the perp. We got a visual on the coffin. We learned it was an anonymous tip that led investigators to an industrial complex where acclaimed Hollywood actress Emily Moore was found in a coffin. Police say that she is suffering from severe shock. Her kidnapper is still at large. I spent five days in a body bag. The things that he did to me... I thought I was gonna die. I just... I just wanna have a normal life. I just want to get a movie and have some focus. I understand, Emily. As your therapist, I believe you need time to process everything you've been through. You avoid talking about the baby. About losing it. You need a break before we go into that? Yeah. I'm so sorry I'm late, I was with a patient. Mm. I'm glad you're here. Me too, babe. I booked the tickets. We're off to Spain. You're so cute when you're sleeping. Oh, I was having a nightmare. The usual? Mm. Yeah. I don't know why I keep having it. Post-traumatic. Okay, doctor. But I'm not one of your patients. Are you sure no one knows we're here? What if he finds us? There's no record of us even coming to the island. The house belongs to friends of friends. I haven't even met them. Don't worry, baby, you're safe. Well, the house is beautiful. Pretty cool, huh? Wait till you see the inside. After you. So, what do you think? It's beautiful. Told you so. Honey. I just wanted to say that, um, I know I've been way too focused on work lately, and I'm really excited to spend some time with you here alone. Thanks, babe. Mm. I think I'm gonna go exploring. Okay, sounds great. I'll catch up with you. I'm gonna grab the other bags. Mm. Wow. Incredible, huh? We used to have a cliff like this where I grew up. You never told me that. I tortured my parents by threatening to jump. A teenager's way of getting attention. I guess. Sometimes I wish I had. Then you'd be dead. Then you would have had a proper wife. My life would be very boring. I just wanna be normal again. You'll get there, kiddo. I promise. We came out here as husband and wife for a nice vacation. I don't wanna be a case study here is what... Oh. I'm not turning it into some case study. I just need to get ahold of myself, you know? I survived. End of story. Well, that's... That's great. What? What's wrong? You... I saw someone. Are you okay? I saw someone. Robert. There's nobody out there. It's okay. I'm seeing things that aren't there. Listen to me, what you're experiencing right now is perfectly normal for someone who's been through something like this. Healing is a process, it takes time. You're doing great. You promise? Absolutely. Trust me, okay? There's no desperate fan out there. Except me, of course. I don't think he was a fan. Robert. In the kitchen. Preparing your dinner. You sleep okay? What's wrong? I heard the baby in... In my dream. Emmy. I dream about him all the time. Me too. I'm so sorry I lost him. It wasn't your fault. Do you, um... You want something to help you relax? Are you sure that's a good idea? Yeah. Just a little something to help take the edge off. Okay? I love you. I love you more. Robert. Robert, wake up. I think there's someone outside. It's fine, baby, it's those, um, doors downstairs. It's okay. Robert! Robert! You have to help me. Robert! No! Listen to me. Sleep okay? Who was she? It was, uh, some backpacker. She was hiking with her boyfriend and there was an accident. What kind of an accident? He fell from a cliff. Oh, my God. Is he okay? She tried to help him, but unfortunately, he didn't make it. Well, what about her? She all right? Physically, yes, but emotionally, she's pretty shook up. What about the family? Have you contacted them? That's complicated. I'm not even sure if she has one. Huh. Right. Here we go again. This... There's not even a hospital on this island, okay? I'm concerned she could be suicidal. Yeah. She could be dangerous. How do you know she's telling the truth? I spent the entire night with the authorities. She's telling the truth, trust me. I think you should put her on the next boat out. I'm a psychiatrist. You know what that means. So now this is our problem. Emily, be reasonable. She's in a foreign country, her boyfriend dies, she runs into some fellow Americans and we tell her to fuck off? How long is she staying, Robert? What would you like me to tell her? "My wife's not well. Go somewhere else to kill yourself"? You couldn't even spare a couple weeks to be with me? Her boyfriend was killed last night. That may be. I will not refuse a human being in need. You know that. Actually... you're doing a pretty good job just now. That's perfect. I'll tell her to leave. So you'll pick her up in an hour? Okay. That works. All right, thanks. Bye. Baby, one of the things I love about you is your integrity. Let's help her out. You're sure? I'll have her out of here in no time, I promise. It'll be nice to have some life around here. Let's get her back on her feet. I am, actually. Sorry. How are you doing? Devastated. I... I can't believe he's gone. This has been such a nightmare. I'm just glad that you're here and you're willing to help me. Well... let's get you some clothes. If it's not too much trouble? Don't be silly. What about this one? Yeah, it'll look nice. Okay. By the way, I've seen all your movies. Heh, heh. I'm a huge fan, for real. Thanks. That looks good. It's a little baggy. Ha-ha-ha. Oh, you have such great taste, Emily. Really cool stuff. I think that one's gonna look really good. We'll be right down. Okay. Yeah. That one looks really cute. Heh, heh. Okay, I'm decent now, you can come in. Hey, Sarah. Could you, uh...? Mind waiting downstairs? I'll be right there. Sure. Thank you. You okay? Yeah, she's a sweetheart. So go work your magic, mister. Go. It's a good apple. Heh, heh. Worlds apart And I feel That we're running out Of love While we are here Soft-spoken Goodbye 'Cause nothing is real Nothing is real So Michael's on the mainland for a film festival, and we are gonna have coffee. Another film festival? Ha-ha-ha. Yup. Guy gets around. Did you, uh, call for the boat? I'll take you down. No, I think I can do it. I'm proud of you, kiddo. - Robert! - What? Robert, there's someone under the bed. There's someone under the bed. Okay, okay. Look. Look. Okay. Okay. Please be careful. Okay. There's nobody down there, babe. Hey, smile. How could you? What do you mean? Patrick just broke up with me on the phone. Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Why are you sorry, huh? I know it was you. We didn't mean to. You're my best friend. It just happened. Nothing just happens. It's all about you, isn't it? It's all about you. No. I'm sorry. It's all about you. How could you? You're a liability, Emily. You tried to go back to work after the incident and you weren't ready. People are afraid to book you now. You walked away from that play. It was theater. I couldn't stand how everybody was looking at me after everything that happened. You're an actress. I wanna do movies. What about that comedy I got you? You turned it down. It was a crappy supporting role. I had to play a mom. You're not 17 anymore. Oh, I realize that. You know, this girl showed up at our house the other day. Her boyfriend fell off a cliff and died. It was awful. Jesus Christ. I know. There's never a boring moment around you. Robert's at home right now taking care of her. I bet he is. Michael. She's 19. You don't feel threatened? Should I? Tsk. It is so nice here. How do you feel? Alone, I guess, without John. How about your parents? I'd rather not talk about that. What's your next project? Oh, I think I'm gonna work in the herb garden a little. It's lovely. Ha-ha-ha. I meant as an actress. I know. Is it hard to get jobs now? I mean, like, after your breakdown? I'm sorry, I didn't... It's okay. You can't be out of the game for too long. But it hasn't really affected me, as an actress. I'd love to be an actress. Yeah? I got offered a part recently, a comedy, but I turned it down. The lead? No. But I'm glad to see you're feeling better. Did they ever find out who he was? They're still looking. Some mentally disturbed person. What was he like? You know, I never really saw his face. Hm. Allan, it's Emily. Emily Moore. Heh. Hi. Yeah, I know it's been a while. No, no, I'm fine. I'm great. Heh. Yeah. Yeah, no, I was calling about the screenplay. The comedy. I know I turned it down, um, at first. But I also know I was your first choice. Hi, it's Emily. Uh... To talk to Peter. Pete. It's Emily. What happened to your voice? Oh, you're at a party. Really? What kind of party? Oh, right. Well, no, I was calling about the TV show. Well, I don't give a shit whether you gave it to someone else. Okay. Thank you. Hi, it's Emily Moore. Actually... I have the wrong number. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I didn't... I didn't mean to startle you like that. Give us a minute, okay? Relax. Okay, baby? I saw the... the girl from underneath the bed. I think it was Sophie. We talked about this. Sophie's dead. Remember? I stole her boyfriend. You know, I don't wanna be here anymore. Listen to me. You came here to relax and heal, right? To go back to the States with the phones ringing and all the Hollywood bullshit, it would just defeat the purpose. I mean, right when you're making so much progress. Plus, we've got Sarah. Sarah? Yeah. It's time to send her home. Baby... you know we can't do that. Really? Keys. Just calm down. Sarah is fine. There's plenty of food. We're leaving. Take a breath, would you? Is it important to you that I stay? Of course it's important to me. Why? Because we've come all this way, and quite frankly, you have to stop running from your problems. You just wanna stay so you and Sarah can... Sarah and I... Whoa. Sarah and I can what? Huh? Listen, just do me a favor, let's go back inside the house. No. What would you like me to do, then? Call Michael. Michael? Yes. You're serious? Yes. I want him here. Call Michael. She's doing great. Yeah, she's, you know, just having a tough day. Yeah. I just think she would love to see you. You can come? Oh, that's great, Michael. Perfect. All right, see you then. Oh, sorry. It's okay. I just have to pee. I'm sorry I butted in yesterday and asked about your abduction. It's all right. No, it's not. I don't know why I did that. It's just that you're such a nice couple. You think? You have everything. Gorgeous husband who loves you... great career... perfect body... the house. Sometimes I just feel so ugly. Oh, Sarah. I hate my boobs. I mean... look at them. They're so small. I... I think they're fine. You sure? You're right. They're too small. Michael, you came. I'm Michael, Emily's guardian angel. You must be Sarah? Nice to meet you. I'm so happy you're here. Excuse me. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Let me show you around. I know it seems a little silly, but do you think you could stay a little? You know, a couple of days? Heh, heh. I'm here. There's something strange about Sarah. She lost her boyfriend, she's young, needs someone to talk to, I guess. Oh, I know that she wants more than therapy. All right. I'm gonna have to rearrange a few appointments. Can you do that a little later? You know what? I am actually gonna turn this thing off for once. It's not just her. Michael... I'm seeing things. Really weird things. Well... that's what you get for smoking all that weed. Oh, that was lovely. Well, ahem, Sarah... why are you here? I think you know why, Michael. Hm? She recently experienced a traumatic loss. Her boyfriend died and she's trying to work through it. And you chose to open your heart to a complete stranger? That's how therapy works, Michael. Well, it's... quite a coincidence, wouldn't you say? How's that? That she, uh, would knock on your door out here in the middle of nowhere. Well, there aren't very many doors to knock on, so as a psychiatrist, I'm thrilled that she found us. Oh, I bet you are. And I am so glad that Emily and Robert let me into their house. I don't know what I would've done if they hadn't. Are you rich? Oh, dear. Uh... Wow. Didn't you know? Robert is a kept man. Here we go. Actually, Emmy's parents were quite wealthy, yes. So Emily was spoiled rotten. Actually, I was not spoiled rotten. I... I thought you made your money from acting. That came later. I did that to prove a point. Emily ran away from home at about your age to become an actress. She inherited later. The movie roles didn't really matter. Yeah, but I make my own money. Honey, your dad was a multimillionaire. Really? Well, it's a slight exaggeration. She even supported Dr. Bob back when he was in school. What do you think? Robert was a good investment here? Absolutely. Thank you, Sarah. So do you get all the money if Emily dies? Actually, her family's money is tied up in a charitable foundation. Yeah. Otherwise, I would have been dead by now. You did not just say that. Oh. Do you guys wanna go swimming? Robert? Did you hear that? Oh, I think I'll do the dishes. I'm not going swimming. Come on, honey. So are you guys coming? Heh. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Ooh! Oh, it's cold. I think I'll pass. Chicken. Enjoy. Can you unzip me? Sure. Whoo! Come on in. The water feels great. I think she has a crush on him, and I think he's flattered by it. But I don't think it's anything more than that. Yeah. You're probably right. I'm not exactly thrilled by it. Whoo! Hey. Come on. Ha, ha. Hello, gorgeous. Don't. Don't what? Nothing. Are you jealous? I saw the way you looked at her when she undressed. How come you never look at me that way? Are you kidding? You want her. No, I don't. Why not? Because she's my patient. Otherwise you would. I'm married to a beautiful actress who men have lusted for for years. You know what? Give me my little moment here, okay? Now you finally know what it feels like. I just feel so ugly. I know. Poor baby. You're old and ugly and nobody loves you anymore. Baby. You're not funny. Really? Yeah. Then why are you smiling? Hm? Come to bed, darling. I think I'll finish the dishes. Wanna join? Good morning. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Where is everyone? They went to the mainland. Robert wanted to get some food, and I think Michael had to go back to L.A. I'm testing my personality. Wanna join? Is my husband good to talk to? Very good. My old shrink was old and fat. Heh. So it's pretty nice with someone like Robert. "On a scale from 1 to 10, how jealous are you?" Pardon me? It's the first question. Oh. Ha, ha. Um... I really don't know. I've been wondering... Yeah? How's Robert in bed? Uh... That's really none of my business. You're probably not steaming up the bedroom windows anyway. Heh. What do you mean? Nothing. No, you meant something. No, I... I just thought that maybe you might not feel sexy when you... What, Sarah? When you've been to the loony bin. So are you and Robert like... forever and ever? Yeah, that's the idea. You think that's his idea too? I am back from the mainland with all of your favorite goodies. Don't move. I'm about to prepare the most insane meal for you two. I got all the ingredients for your favorite, puttanesca. Wait, wait. We should do this together. Like a cooking threesome. What do you say, babe? She thinks we're not fucking. Where'd she get that? I have no idea. What have you been telling her? Honey, she's a total stranger. I would never tell her something like that. Are you sick of me? I love you. Well, if that's the truth, then she goes. Either she leaves or I leave, Robert! Okay, okay. She's not your responsibility. Technically, no. But we let her in. I felt an obligation to try and help her. Okay? If you're uncomfortable with it, I'll work something out. Good. What you don't understand about Sarah is she has no filter. She has no concept of what hurts people. Well, that makes two of you. She's been through a lot, okay? I thought you, of all people, would understand. Oh, I do understand. I just can't deal with her right now. Fine. I'll make some calls, I'll have a colleague take care of her when she gets back. Perfect. Emily, I'll go now. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry and I didn't mean anything by it. I know, Sarah. Take care of yourself. And let us know when you get home safely. You ready? So you don't wanna talk about your father? No. Why not? Because it really hurts. That's why we're here. Let's talk about that. It doesn't matter. Well, you said, um, earlier, that you wanted to die. Why is that? Because I'm a girl. If you were a boy, how would that make things different? I would have killed him. Why would you wanna kill your father? Because he's fucking me. You wanna take a break? No. Okay. Um... How about your boyfriend? He didn't know. Why is that? If I told anyone, my father would have killed me. Was your boyfriend aware of the fact that you were pregnant? I couldn't tell him because I knew it wasn't his. Was your father aware of the pregnancy? Yeah. How did he respond? He was pleased. Can you believe it? He said, "Now we can finally be a family again." I see. After you, um, terminated the pregnancy, what happened then? I can't... Take your time. First he broke my jaw. Then when I was laying on the floor, he ripped my clothes off and raped me again. Let's stop there, okay? That's nice work, Sarah. That's session one. Sarah Hallman, March 3rd, 2011, 2:14 p.m. This is really horrible stuff she went through. I thought it was just the accident. Do you realize what an ethical breach it is for you to be listening to those sessions? How much trouble I can get in? Why didn't you say anything? You didn't seem to care. Well, maybe if you told me, I wouldn't have wanted her out. It's a little late for that now, isn't it? How was she... when she left? Great. Let down by yet another person she trusted. It's exactly what she needed. Where do you think she's going? I don't know. Back to Daddy. Sarah's mother died when she was 9. She has no siblings, cousins, no grandparents. She never went to school after 8th grade, so she doesn't even have friends. Just her father. I'm going for a walk. I need to get some air. I think this is definitely a surprise twist in the first episode of this new season. Hey. What are you watching? - -Kill me if I spoil any of it for you. Some young starlet. You think I'm pretty? No. I think you're fucking hot. You just wanna get laid. Hey. My mom called today. Ah, your mother hates me. No, she doesn't, actually. She asked how we're doing. How are we doing, doctor? Hello? Yeah. Hello? This is Robert Moore, yes. Who is it? Oh, I'm sorry? Oh, my God. Oh, no. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. Who was that? Sarah's dead. What? They found her in her seat on the plane. She, uh, overdosed on tranquilizers. Oh, my God. They found my name in her cell phone. It was the last number that she dialed. It's my fault. First he broke my jaw. Then when I was laying on the floor, he ripped my clothes off and raped me again. First he broke my jaw. Then when I was laying on the floor, he ripped my clothes off and raped me again. First he broke my jaw. Then when I was laying on the floor, he ripped my clothes off and raped me again. Everyone around me dies. Robert? Yes? You're not gonna leave me, are you? Of course not. I'm not going anywhere. Are you sure? I'm sure. Hey. Let me get you something to help you relax, okay? Okay. Help me! Please! Robert, please let me in! Help! Help! Help! First he broke my jaw. Then when I was laying on the floor, he ripped my clothes off and raped me again. Sarah? Sarah, is that you? It's us. No. Will you comfort him when he's dead? We'll come back for you. No! No! Robert! Robert, they're gonna kill you! Emily? Robert! Robert! What's going on? What's wrong? They're back. They're back, and they're gonna kill us. Emily, calm down. Calm down. They locked me up. Who? Sarah and Sophie. Emily, listen to me, when someone has been subjected to extreme trauma... I'm telling the truth! So Sarah and Sophie are back? Where are they? Hm? There were footprints. There were muddy footprints. In here? Yes. Where? They were right here. This is happening. Honey, there's only a lock on the inside of the door. No. No, that's impossible. Baby, the door opened as soon as I grabbed it. There she is. I swear she was there, Robert. I know. Baby, I know. No, you don't know. You really don't. Listen to me. Let's get some sleep, okay? Go to bed? Right? It was her, Robert. I swear. What the hell is going on? Hey. Lie down. You okay? No. I'm just so scared. There's no reason to be scared. I'll protect you. Hey, scoot over. You really don't get it, do you? Close your eyes. Close them! Either you do it yourself, or I'll do it for you. No, Michael, no. She's not getting better. In fact, she's having a very, very tough time. The whole place is turned upside down. I don't know. I've gotta go. Emily. She'll never leave us alone. Dead people just don't come back. She sat on top of me with a huge fucking knife! No, okay? There's only one person who could be responsible for all these things. You understand? You think it's me. Why? You wanted Sarah and Sophie to come back to punish you, but they can't. You're doing this to yourself. That's ridiculous. They're not the ones that have to let go of us, honey. You have to let go of them. I didn't trash the house, and I didn't write a message to myself. Look at your hands. I wanna leave this island. Okay. Now. Let's go. Can you call and get a boat? Yeah. Right. Shit, my battery's dead. Where's my charger? Wait. Did you hear that? What? Someone's here. Emily. Enough, okay? Enough already! We're trapped in this place. No, we're not. Look out! Oh! It's time for your medicine, Emily. Aah! Emily. Emily, darling. Where's Robert? One thing at a time. What do you want? Oh, I think you know. I wanna go back to the house. Not so fast, Emily. I wrote a suicide note, and I really think that you should hear it. "Dear Robert, I am so tired. I just can't do this anymore. I know you love me and it's so wonderful when we are together. But I just can't understand why you didn't keep your promise to me." What promise? That you would leave your wife. You're insane. Robert thought so too. Unfortunately, he was a little too slow to figure it out. Where is he? Did you kill him? He used me and then he left me. If I can't have him... You fucking psycho! You're the one who's seeing ghosts, honey. He's mine. You're dead. Thank God you're all right. I thought you were dead. I'm so sorry I ever let her in, baby. I never, ever thought it would come to this. Who was she? A former student of mine who became an assistant for a while. What? Wait, she was telling the truth? It was meant to be harmless role-play. I was developing a new treatment, a radical therapy that was designed to help you get better. Harmless? Sarah is dead, Robert. I thought by mirroring your trauma with Sarah's claims of abuse that I could somehow encourage your mind to develop a firmer grasp of reality. It didn't work. You regressed. No, Robert, you've regressed. You're a fucking monster. She just tried to kill me. This is what I'm talking about, baby. You still can't seem to differentiate between what's real and what's not. We both know that you attacked that girl. Was it because you were jealous? You want my money. What are you talking about? I thought you loved me. I do love you, baby. That's the hard part. I just can't live with you anymore. You'll never get away with this. Really? You just killed a young, beautiful woman, and your prints are all over her. It was self-defense. I think we're gonna have you committed again. I'm calling the police. So why do you think she killed her? Simple act of jealous rage, I suppose. She thought that, uh... Sarah and I were having an affair and that Sarah was gonna try to hurt or kill her in some attempt to try to replace her. It's textbook schizophrenia. That would be my preliminary diagnosis, definitely. Schizophrenia. Today, 34-year-old actress Emily Moore was found guilty of first-degree murder. The jury chose not to take into account Emily Moore's claim that she was somehow set up by her husband, the renowned psychiatrist Robert Moore. Her sentence will be determined at a court hearing next week.
