Our cut is still the same. Fng 10,000 rupees! Can we get anything in 10,000? - No. I think they've taken the Punjab police for granted. There's no regard for lavv and order here.

Tommy Singh's arrest is the latest development... in the drug crisis that has been plaguing Punjab for the last few years... And we have with us eminent politician IVIP - i\/Ir. ivlaninder Brar Instead of taking concrete steps to tackle the drug menace... Why is the government going for soft targets like Tommy Singh. People like Tommy Singh - they are the ones who are encouraging drug addiction in our society with their music, with their choice of lifestyle. Look at the kind of videos they are making. I think the youth of Punjab deserves a better role model than Tommy Singh. Bloody phoney! -The mi k's come to a boil. Turn off the stove! - Please understand this. Breakfast! Drop Balli off to college. He's still asleep. Good morning to you also! Phagvvara's boy transformed from Punjab's Gabru to a menace to society. Greetings. Greetings, son. You ready?

No, madam. The boys must have forced him. My Balli isn't the kind. Have you seen his hands? His veins are turning blue, thanks to the needles. "My boy is not like that, it's the others!" Madam... Madam... Sorry, madam. I had no idea. I was just checking, madam... Will he be able to give it up? It is up to him. And his environment. At such high dependence, a person loses comprehension. He is my younger brother. Dad left me to raise him. After he's discharged, bring him to my clinic. Ivlaqbool road, opposite Rajju's mansion. We'll do our best. Okay? Hello. Stuff... Do you want stuff? Wrong number. - Three kilos of heroin. I will not call again. Hovv much? Three thousand. Write down the address. Just a second. Birdbrain!

And now you sing songs here? Aren't you ashamed! She was not giving us money. We needed to have our fi. What else could we do. Tales of a /one/y night, Lone in a daze, Nobody in sight Don I turn back to look Don I turn back to look Faces lurking around the brook. Fear stings like a venomous snake Distant dreams grin at my fate. Look what just crept up from behind Fear of the unknown Turning me blind. Keep an eye, Tread with caution Eerie faces, beaming so often. Fear stings like a venomous snake Distant dreams grin at my fate. Fear stings like a venomous snake Distant dreams grin at my fate. The world is shrinking into a dot I can't breathe, I m left to rot. Draw me a few lines, I beg of you. Let me snort happiness, I beg of you. Alcohol fades ih comparison to its high. I see god in my veins When I shoot up and fly. My veins throbbing with desire Just one inhale, and I'll retire I feel empty, I feel lone/y. I am agitated, I can't go on. My body is trembling, My soul on fire Death is crooning, Feels like my pyre My gul/et is dry as a bone Life is leaving me One breath at a time. When will this misery end When will I end? I run and hide From nobody but myself. I think she is the same girl... Faster! Bro, why is she running into the fields? Kuku, stop her, sister fr! What is she doing? Yes, sir. - Run... run!

Hold her down. e me a FS! "After a vvhole week..." "Tommy Singh was finally released from prison today." "While agreeing to his bail, the court has specified..." "that his celebrity status shouldn't warrant any eniency." Move aside. - Tommy, who is the GABRU? - Where has the GABRU gone? - Where has Tommy, the GABRU gone? At least let me get inside. Move. A single person takes to drugs. But, it affects the entire family. Initially, drugs are taken for pleasure. Later, drugs become their life goal. - Open the door, I beg you! Love, friends, family, career, education... Nothing remains! What do I do with you? Leave him, Sartaj. Let him go, son. Let him go. Leave him. I'm away from home all day. Hovv do I know what's happening here? You all shou d've taken care of him. Everything that is beautiful within the person, his adorations in life, drugs finishes off everything. I am not reciting hearsay. I have seen it with my own eyes. Sign here. Mother, I want to go home. Don't worry, son. Just a little longer. Shyam, take him to the ward. Go with them, kiddo. - Thank you, Doctor. Let's go, my dear. Thank you, Madam. Now it's all up to you. Thank you. Wait a moment. - Yes? Net time, don't come here in your uniform. Vvhy? What were you saying the other day? You weren't aware of what was happening with your brother? Have any idea what's happening in Jashanpura? In Amritsar? In Tarn Taran? In all of Punjab? Do you have any idea? You're an Assistant Inspector, right? Which department? What is the matter, madam? Why are you talking to me like this? What's your 'cut' for not having an idea? Ten thousand a week, isn't it? Then why have you got him here? Take him to a private clinic in Delhi. What is it, Madam? Because I am silent... What will you say? It doesn't bother you to ruin a generation. But when it comes to your brother, it hurts? Madam... This is what he's addicted to. A combination of Pheniramine and buprenorphine. You must've seen this bottle somewhere. Or do you have no idea about this too? They are two separate drugs... that should only be sold with prescription. But thanks to you, the producers are combining these drugs... and sellers are openly selling them by the name of Chaancf, in every chemist shop. For a mere 5O rupees. The price of your brother's life! It's my turn tonight. Let them go, baby. Let them go. All good? Do you want to do her? She looks good. Let go. I need to buy a phone, sir. - Buy it net time.

Don't mention anything to anyone. Hurry UP- There is a system. And everyone has to follow it. I can handle him being beaten up. But hovv can you damage his truck? It is Pehelvvan's truck! Pehelwan is a Member of Parliament. Yet he pays our cut. Doesn't he? He can have both of us suspended. Brother, I want to go home. Go home. Take care of Balli. Go. Whatsapp me if there is a problem. - Make it quick. There's a lot to finish. - No Issues. - Everything is in control. - No, no. It's okay. - Hey, boss is here. - Come. Have some tea. [Vote for Rajveer Singh! Vote for barbelll] You are not my mother But an enemy. You've sent me to exile too soon. Hello, baby. Baby... Look here! Look here! Smile please... It's nice. You look pretty. Tell me if you need anything. Anything for you. We've spoilt you. She is quite petite. She looked okay on the phone. New phone? Yes, sir. I bought it for 8000 rupees. Eight thousand! You aren't worth it. New phone! She won't bite, right? No, sir. She's well trained now. Hey, Tommy. My darling child! Do one thing... Just make one hit number! Just one monster hit song! And then there is that anti-drug concert. It's the best step for our image. Will help the case too. Public will know that our Tommy is no more into drugs. He's clean now. Told you it's not happening. Told you! Uncle... I think our bro here can probably do with some inspiration. &is te r fx Your 'inspiration' sent my boy to jail. Novv, if you even mention it... - I am sorry, uncle. I want to go to London. I want to go to London! I have to go to London. You shut up! Killed your mother! I want to go to London! Going to London, fs! Open the door, Monty. I say open the door. - Please, sir. Please, sir. Stop. Please don't. - I'll shoot! No... no! - Move away. Bro, what are you doing? - Get out of my way. I'll shoot. - No... no! Son... Son, the court will decide if you can go or not. You only do your concert. I don't want to do the concert. I want to go. Please let me go, uncle. Sister fr! You'll shoot me? Me? I made you a star. Your father had abandoned you, sister fr!. - I want to go, uncle. I got your younger sister married, fr! - I want to go... And you'll shoot me? Shoot me! Let me go. Shoot... shoot! - Call your mom in the morning. Get up Kiddo. Get up, child. Easy! - No! Have the medicine. Have. You'll feel better. - I won't! It isn't bitter. Very good! They're luring voters with drugs this election, not alcohol or blankets. Trucks are loaded with this stuff. Godowns are getting filled. It's a well organised operation. Party workers will be distributing them in every village. I will drag Pehelwan by his balls to jail. I will either lose my job or I will get shot. You decide if you want to take it to the media. It may get difficult to hush the matter later. Might get your name on all the front pages too! Fighting from within the system... and shouting slogans from the sidelines... You'll realise the difference with this case, madam. Hey listen... hello! What's the point in arresting Pehelwan alone? What? There is a Pehelwan sitting in every district. So? Pehelwan is just a dealer of these drugs. The manufacturers are the ones to be arrested. Find out about their factory. Raid them. Madam, have you seen my uniform? Hovv many stars do I have? One star. What does one star mean? D. .G.? Commissioner? I am only an Assistant. You said that this stuff is being made to lure voters. So there must be a political connection. There is no political connection. This is politics! The sermons that you give on TV about narco politics. This is it. So many IVIPs are dealers themselves. We can shout from the rooftops, no one will listen to us. Election Commission. Elections will take place in a month. Right now, the Commission is powerful in the state. Add media pressure to that, they'll be forced to take action. But everything has to be done before the elections. I am sorry about yesterday. Hang on. I just want to talk to you. Sir, I am just a driver. From the factory to the godown, and godovvn to the factory. I don't know about these games. Your factory is in Barotivvala near the Himachal border, isn't it? Come, let's take a ride. No, sir. I will lose myjob. I came from my village just to earn a living. I have to arrange for my sister's wedding, too. Fk Off! I've been snooping around the factory for four days, madam. Inside out. Took lot of pics too. From outside, the factory appears to be shut for long. Just some guards outside. Work happens in the morning shift. 9 AIVI through 7 PM. Covertly. I searched everywhere but I found nothing. Looked into the workshop, too. Inspected the machines. I saw some oil bottles there but no names on them. No factory signboard either. We won't get information about the owners from here. These are the chemicals used to make this drug. Ethanol, Hydrochloric Acid, Methyl, Paraben, Ivlaleic Acid, Opium. They aren't easy to procure. Some are imported... and some are controlled. Like Opium. Only two places in India where opium is legally manufactured... Neemuch and Ghazipur. Detailed paper work is required to source opium from there... with thorough inspection. Any random company can't procure from there. It is issued to licensed pharmaceutical companies only. Novv, if they are procuring such large amounts of opium... it means either a pharma company or its employee is supplying them illegally. And they are doing all the paper work behind a bogus company. If we find out the name of this company and its owner we'll understand the entire political nexus, Sana]. That's it. Their game will be over. I'm slow in these matters. I barely made it past college. I've been at it since four days. Whatever I could find, I have. You can take someone's help. Whose help can I take? If anyone in the department finds out... Think, Sana]. Think of something. Are you bloody mad? Only you know this chemical business. Are you out of your mind? No way! We will go after the shift is over. Ecept for two watchmen, nobody is going to be there. We don't have to go today. Maybe after a couple of days. This is not my job, Sana]. I am a doctor. A lady at that. All the men in Punjab are drugged out, madam. Now it's up to the ladies. You have saved Ba i's life. I won't let anything happen to you. Careful! Where is Tommy's Diet Coke? I had the Diet Coke kept. Where is the Diet Coke? - Where is the Diet Coke, sister fr!? Get the Diet Coke. This should have been put first. Careful. Get it fast. Son, it happens. It was cocaine's withdrawal symptom Love you... Hug me as vvell, daddy. Hovv are you? -A okay? Do you want a dose? - No. Our man's shooting up at the back. Go join. I have a bad stomach. Okay then. They've put us on a double shift. They think we are dogs. Why don't you say something? There's no point to it. Who cares about us? Tommy! Tommy! Move aside. There was an election rally at Jashanpura, organised by Ivlaninder Bran... He addressed over thousand people... He raised the issue of drugs ruining the youth... He appealed to the people, asking their support in this issue. I want to tell the youth of Punjab... that this whole fight, this vvar on drugs, is above all, an individual war. We're with you in this war. We are here to support you. I appeal to the the youth of Punjab, to fight it back! My dear young ones, march on! We are with you. My dear young ones, march on! We are with you. Hey, Kaka, Lucky, Sonu! Get up all of you! She's running away. Found anything? Look at this. They want to ruin all of Punjab. What are they on to? There is nothing here, Sana]. Let's look over there. Come on. Let's get going. Wasn't it a day off today? - Sir, the Ghazipur goods are here. Sartaj, I think this is the consignment This is what we were looking for. Do you have a safety pin? Come out as soon as I call you. Okay? 9K8)- Don't vvorry. I am here. -Be careful. - Watch it, it's heavy. - Keep it here. - Hurry. - Get that here. - Faster. - Move it. Easy. . . - I got it... [Opium and Alkaloids] - Move it. Good job. Brother, please take over. What happened? What's with the power? I think the power has gone out. Even I know that. The power has not gone. There are lights outside. Only our factory is blacked out. I think the fuse must have blown. Why are you standing here and talking about it? Do something. Come on. - Come. Check if there's a lose connection. Turn the damn generator on! Just find some help. Everything is okay here... Did you find anything? No. Everything is okay here. Turn the damn generator on! This damn power cut! Thank God, the power's back on. Everybody back to work. What was the problem? The fuse was down. Come on hurry up. Come on. Sana]. .. Sana], come on. Leave it. I'll ride. Sit tight. Stop! Tommy, try the blonde look. It will suit you. GABRU, The Great! My hero... The crowd is in a crazy mood. Rock the show! Daddy, relax! You're adding to the pressure. What is your problem? We're just talking. None of your business. I can't do this. Ricky, enough already! You want to turn him into Lady Gaga? Funny, eh? Get lost. I will thrash you. Brother, I understand. If there's no fuel in the car, will it run? Never. And our car is a Range Rover. When you drive a Range Rover, you need more fuel. Fuel. Now you tell me, who's the GABRU? Say it! Get ready quickly. I am out of here. And yeah, I love you, too! Where is it? Can I say something, madam? Go on. ... Sana]. .. I want to take you on a date. Sana]. .. Will you come to a coffee shop with me? Sana]? Madam... I've never seen a lady like you. You are surrounded by filth. Yet, you are absolutely clean. Dignity. Okay. Now get up. You sitting too far away, madam. Do you know? What hit me the most... Life's worst tragedy, Madam, To lose someone you love, And not being able to do anything about it. Father had passed away. If my brother had too... That day, you didn't save him, but me instead. Sana], look at me. Look at me. Now show me your tongue. Martyr Sartaj Singh. Nothing is going to happen to Balli. Nothing. Are you sure? Promise. Brave warrior-madam, Preet Sahni! Commander, drugs on war. Not drugs on war, vvar on drugs. And I am no hero. I am only trying. There are two wars going on in Punjab. The one you and I are fighting against people like Pehelvvan, against the system. That is easy. The real vvar on drugs... is the one that people like Balli are fighting. With themselves.
