Do you agree? Good boy. This collar... is a symbol of your soul. When I place this collar around your neck, you'll seize to be human. You'll become Bonnie. Obidient, careful, Bonnie. Do you think you can do this time without screwing up my new shoes? For your sake, I hope so. Wait! Go. O my God! What have you done here, Bonnie? You have spilled water all over my new shoes. Every time I buy a pair of new shoes, you ruin them. Come On. Fetch it. Good boy. Lick it up. Lick it up, I said. Not the ankle, Bonnie. The shoe. Good. Am I gonna be one of them when I get older? Could be worse. You might become a social worker. Do you have a license? Uh, a learners. - Oh, that's a license. Come on! I can only drive with someone who has a license. Do you have one? Of course, I do. But they took it away. Marlene, Charlie. Charlie, Marlene. I don't think I can drive Marlene. What are we looking at? Nothing yet. We're waiting. Can you speak to people who aren't living anymore? Just start talking. They are all around. I don't know what to say. Who is it? My dad. When did it happen? Three and a half weeks ago. Charlie... I think it was my fault. - No Come here. Close your eyes. Can you see him? Kind of. I see him. What do you want to ask him? I want to know if he's mad at me. So... you should ask him. He won't talk to me. He will. He'll... he'll make a sign. What kind of sign? Be patient. You'll see it. Do you know one of these kids? Let's go. Do you need anything else? No. I might get back to work. - Don't. Let's do the thing. And the second one down. And the bottom one. You're so beautiful. Well, your test has come back. It's negative. We've had good reports from your safety officer. And now all seems to be relaxed with you, so things are looking up. Our recommendation is that we set a date to reinstate custody. Thank you. Hey, Maggie. Where are you? I had a drink problem. I met some guy, who got me into it, in Paris. And then, we moved here and... I can't leave. Why can't you leave? I was looking after him. A kid. He was my responsibility. But I used to get fucked up every morning at 10 on the door, so ... One day I came out of the room and he was gone ... I kept looking everywhere but I couldn't find him. So ... He had gone out, on the street and he was ... hit by a motorbike. And he was lying on the road and he kept saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry." Like if it was his fault. It was my fault. Right after I took an overdose. What I hoped was going to be an overdose. What happened to the kid and his mom? I was the mom, Charlie. The kid was mine. I can't touch him. I undress myself. This is what do first, when I get upset. I come here to calm down. It's not working on me. Well ... there is a plan B. Here. So you see this? Like that. - Okay. If you want... - No, no, this is better. This is working. Are you kidding me! -Ha ha! Look at the lil kids. Come on, let's go. Fuck! I can't face him. Take me somewhere. Grab my hand. - Yeah, I feel like I'm 16 again. Fuck! Sorry! Ssshhh...My mom's in the next room. Okay, just wait here. I'll go deal with her. Do not touch anything. I won't, sir. Trying to burn the house down? - Charlie... Can't do it... - It won't work. I know I'm embarassing. I can't do this anymore. I told you not to touch anything. - Your mother's in great shape, huh? Is that your father? - Can you not touch that! A cowboy, eh? Ssshhh... -Cowboy! Give it to me. - No, no, come on. You... are out of control. Just stay. Stay. Hey. - Hey. Chin chin. Come here. You don't want up here, do you? No. I'm just gonna... try something little bit... comfortable. What are you doing? Nothing. Just a... - Nothing? What's behind your back? Nothing. Just a pair of shorts. And ... In the other hand? Open. Oh my god! No, come on. I'm not having sex with you. - I... I know, I know. Okay. - It's just... I just thought you... It was in case you thought you are going to. In ca...Ha Ha! How did he die? He hanged himself in the garage. I found him. Don't blame yourself. Kiss me and make it better? No, you're not going to trick me. Do you wanna come away with me? There's a place where all women hang around with younger guys. Older women, younger guys, by. - Cougarville. Come on, we'd look normal there. - I don't think we'd ever look normal. I love you, Maggie. Kate. Kate! Hey ... - I don't have time for this right now. I've been meaning to drop around, and see if you might need any kind of help. Yeah, look, I don't need anything... - I'm really sorry, huh? Me too. Without touching me. Like this? Now... The other one. What did you just do? Touched you. - Yes. I'm sorry, mistress. - So what do we do now? Everything. Please, mistress. Your safe word is 'mercy'. Do you think you'll ever be able to stop touching me? No, mistress. - Why not? Because I just have to. Yes. But why? Because I love you. - Of Course. You love me. But you know the rules, don't you? You must be punished, for touching me. Do you like it? Alright. Maggie, that's enough. Mercy! Hello. Who is this? Who is this? I'm Charlie's mama?. Mrs. Boyd. Hello? If you don't leave him alone, If you don't get him out of your life, I am going to come back here and destroy you. You'll wish you'd never met him. Do you hear me? You know, he's a 16 year-old boy. What do you want with a boy? I'm glad you came over today, Charlie. Because I wanted face to face to say goodbye to you. What's wrong? - It's over. Why now? - We have gone too far. Maggie, come back. Where are you going? We don't have to stop. It's going great. I'd rather kill myself than lose you. That's what I'll do. Don't blackmail me. I won't take that shit anymore. Not from you, not from anyone. Maggie, just wait. - Go away. Maggie, wait. Maggie. Mistress, may I come inside? Hey, Maggie, what ... What's going on, huh? Fuck! Maggie! Maggie! Fuck you! Hey, look, mistress! Your fucking chairs are in the fucking pool, huh? Now your fucking umbrella's in the fucking pool. huh? Fucking, huh? Do you think I'm gonna get that out for you? No fucking way! Hey, come down here. Come down here now. I know you're up there. Huh? Maggie! Maggie! Fine. Don't come down here. You fucking bitch. Fuck you, Maggie! So... This is our last cup of tea, right? After this you come over here, to the couch. You undress me. You Kiss Me. You touch me. We make love. Express to me all those feelings you say you have. And then afterwards you'll say goodbye. And you never come back here. Is that clear? Yes, mistress. No. It's between you and me now. No more mistress. So, come here. I want to do it. Why is all the pool furniture are in the pool? Sit down. I'm not giving you anymore. What are you talking about? - It's over. What about our plan? Our plan. Over. Come on. - Yeah, come on. Get up. Get up. Don't touch me! Get up! - No. Hey, what are you doing? You're hurting her. You have no idea what deal she made to me. Come on! - No, fuck, get out! Maggie! - Get away. I'll kill you. Get out of my life, both of you. Get out! Thank you so much for coming. Do it right now. Uh, Charlie. Charlie, this is Alice. She needs to talk to you about your friend. Hello, Charlie. I'm Alice. Are you awake? Charlie, I have to ask you some questions. Did you have a relationship with your friend? I take that as a yes. What kind of relationship? "None of your business" kind of relationship. Charlie, I hate to ask you, but was it a sexual relationship? I'm 16. Meaning... - Meaning fuck off! Hey. I want you to come and sit down. Sit. Just take whatever you like. That's your father. Just before he left England. You know, love is not easy, Charlie. It is complicated. It's messy. And it hurts. Hurts like hell, but that doesn't mean you stop. So I want you to take... everything you need. Because I want you to go. Because... I can't live with someone who hates me. But when you come back ... I will be here. Because I have always been here. Come on, Charlie. He is gone. It hurts so much. - I know. I know. It's gonna be alright. Ssshhh... Look, okay? Hi. Hello. Is everything alright, because ... - Yeah, I'm alright. So you're going somewhere? I've come back to get the rest of it. You'll be great. Whoever gets you, is gonna be very lucky. I think we should say goodbye. I'll call you. Don't answer. I'll beg you to call me. Don't. I will pass you in the street. Ignore me. I'll tell someone that I love them but it won't be you. Thank you, Maggie. Welcome. That was his favorite. Might get this one, when I get older. Is that okay? Yeah... I think it is. Come on, mate. Subtitle created by: TANEEM
