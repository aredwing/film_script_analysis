Well, at least you'd save on the rent money. Hey, do you wanna see my apartment? I can give you a tour through the computer. - What do you mean? - Okay. Watch. Hold on. - All right so, this is my living room. - Oh, nice. - And then this is my balcony right here. - It makes it nice and bright. Yeah. All right. And then this is my dining area... - Okay. - ...Slash dancing area. - It's big! - Yeah. - This is my kitchen here. - Nice. Even though you'll never use it. Hey, I can cook a little bit. Oh, your mom's worried you're gonna starve to death. Yeah, well, I'm not going to. - Wait, Emma, you're frozen. - Can you see me? Heh, heh, you should see your face. Okay, okay. - Is it good? - There. You're back. - All right, this is the bedroom over here. - Mm. Nice. - It's still, like, super messy. - You and your mom did good. I know. Oh, wait, I wanna show you one more thing. Hold on one second. What's up there? This is like a little storage unit... or it could be used for really small peep... - Hey. - Hey, hey. - Why are you out of breath? - Oh. Just doing a little ballet. Just messing around. - Oh, you're gonna start dancing again? - I am so bad. Oh, stop. So, what did you do today? Unpacked the whole day. I didn't even go outside once. Dude, stop being a homebody and go out. Go explore, you weirdo. I know. But I have to get settled first. You know me and my OCD. - How was last night? - Well, I ran into Alex at the wrecker. - Ugh. - Yep, he was drunk. He kept saying how you need to get off your high horse... and blah, blah, the usual cra... Here we go. The next stop is Essex. Holy crap. Holy crap. Holy crap. Holy crap. Whoo! Okay, I've always wanted to walk across this, and here I am. Per capita GDP is about 7500. That's very low given the amount that it exports. Now, compared to the GDP of the U.S., which exports a... it could add trillions. I think it's 2.7 trillion to the world economy, and most of that growth... - Emma, right? - Yeah. Your thoughts on economic extraction, very interest... - ...emerging markets, right? - Yeah. - Are you a night person too? - Kind of. I like to do most of my work when the sun isn't out. Mm. Yeah, especially in the city. So many distractions. - Heh. - Um... - Do you mind if I...? - No. Yeah, sit. - Cool. I'm Michael, by the way. - Emma. - Are you from New York or...? - No, I'm actually from the midwest. - Oh. - Wisconsin. - Cool. Good cheese. - Ha. - Yeah. - What? Nothing. It's just that's what everybody always says. - They talk about the cheese. - Ah. What about you? Where are you from? Oh, I'm from Westchester. It's about an hour north of the city. But I live here now though. - I just moved here, so... - Oh, okay. - Yeah, like a week ago. Yeah. - Wow. Jeez, you have so much to see, and do and to eat. I should make you a list or something. - Yeah, yeah, that'd be totally awesome. - Cool. Or I could... you know, I could take you for a cup of coffee sometime. I know a lot of really good coffee shops around here. And what if I don't like coffee? - Then I can take you to a cheese shop. - Ha. Nice. Mm. How about sometime this week? - Yeah. Sure. - Cool. Well, I'll text you. What's your number? - 608-473-4127. - Great. Hello? Hello? Alex, I swear to God, if this is you... Player one. Select your match. Italy. France. England. England. Strong serve. Advantage server. - I got your text. I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. I couldn't get out of bed. Way too hungover. - Oh, God. - I almost didn't go to class. It was actually nice to wander around by myself. Except some guy yelled at me for stopping in the middle of the sidewalk. I forgot that was a thing here. Oh, that's not a joke. People are not playing. Oh, my God, this guy again. This is literally the fifth day in a row he's texted me... and I've ignored him every time. - Is that every guy's dream? - Yes. Thank you. Would you like to speak with him? Because that's how I'm feeling it. But, I don't know, I found the one guy who doesn't want that. - Wait, do you have a person? - No. I mean, I did. I was seeing someone back home, but, uh, we broke up. I just feel like I needed a fresh start here. Yeah. Well, you picked the right place. - We'll see. - Yeah. Ugh. Speak of the devil, it's Alex, my ex. Yeah, he's been texting me. He never really took the breakup so well. Do you like empanada? Almost here. Oh... Whoa. This is huge for New York. Yeah, well, I mean, it's kind of a trade-off. I live so far from everything. - He's really cute. - I know, right? He came up to me in the library out of nowhere. I knew what he was doing, but he was pretty funny. Let's see his other photos. - He has an adorable smile, right? - Yes, I'm sure that's what she thinks too. Poor thing. - Oh. And her too. - Oh, my God. - Oh. And her. - Nicole. I'm sorry. I don't I know if I should hang out with him. - I don't know if I'm ready to date yet. - What? - You said you wanted a fresh start. - I do. Well, then you should absolutely hang out with him. Hey, do you want English breakfast, Earl grey or chamomile? Um... I'll take Earl grey. Oh, I'm serious. I have no idea. Just started playing out of nowhere. Too much porn, girl. That's what you get. No, but come on, seriously. What was that? I don't know. You should take it to that tech place by school. They'll look at it. They'll probably look at it for free, you're cute. - Ugh. So annoying. - You know. - Anything else? - No, just the pad kee mao, please. - Okay. What's your address? - It's 854 Wilson Avenue, apartment 4A. - Should be dropped off in half an hour. - Thank you. It's 854 Wilson Avenue, apartment 4A. - Should be dropped off in half an hour. - Thank you. Okay, so have the egg ready. - Okay. - Now, go back to the pot... and make sure you still have the whirlpool. Okay, then I'm just gonna put it in, right? You're gonna slide it in carefully in the center of the whirlpool. - That's the only tricky part. - Okay. You know, so it, like, nestles in there. Careful. - Ugh. It broke again. - You're hilarious. You go from not cooking at all to making really fancy eggs. Well, you make it look so easy. I mean, Mom, seriously, mine looks like egg drop soup. Do you see that? Yes, I can. But don't worry about it, you'll get it. And have a little patience. - I'm just gonna make sunny side up. - Okay. - So you're feeling okay out there? - Yeah. No, I feel great. I mean, it's been a bit lonely at times... but I don't know, I guess I can focus on myself. Um, and he asked me out for coffee so... - Where did you meet him? - We're in the same class at school. Okay. What's so funny? Because you're just, like, overthinking everything. Let's not get into this agai... When seeing how sustaining the stimulus could increase the challenges when trying to normalize monetary policy. It can also lead to financial instability and expose open ec... - Yes, yes, I did. - Ha-ha-ha. - I think I'm gonna switch to coffee. - Coffee? I thought you didn't like coffee. Well, I don't love it, but I need something stronger. - Do you want another cappuccino? - I'll get it. No, no. Let me. You got the last one. All right. Thanks. - Hi, can I have two cappuccinos? - Yeah, I'll bring it over. - He's gonna bring it over. - Thanks. So I'm going to this dance party thing on the lower east side tonight... - if you wanna come with. - Oh, that sounds fun. But I have plans. If your plans fall through or if you change your mind... I'm a pretty good dancer, so... Wow, that was amazing. They were just so small. Yeah, I know. - Such small movements. - In Ireland, it's a techno... - In Ireland? - It's an underground Irelish sect. - Irelish. - Yeah. It's English and Irish together. Oh, that's great. Oh, my gosh. And they wear electronic kilts and stuff. - That sounds really weird, but that's... - Yeah, but it's cool. - You should definitely check it out. - So you like to wear skirts? - They're not skirts. - They look like skirts. They're electronic dance blankets. - Dance blankets? Okay. - Yeah. Nice move. Keep it up. - Hello? - I'm looking for Ms. Taylor. - Emma Taylor, right? - Yeah. Here you go. I just need you to sign here. - Thanks, have a good one. - Thank you. No. You didn't sign up for anything? Sometimes they send stuff from orientation, welcome gifts or whatever. No, I mean, there's nothing else in the box. There is no letter, no pamphlet, nothing. Am I crazy? - Well, it's a free razor. - Yeah. Watch me get billed in a couple weeks. I have to take a picture of this. This is so funny. You need to get that hat. Okay, you're gonna put on this hat. Here's what my grandmother would take. - Is that good? - Oh, so good. - Room temperature. - Scale of one to 10. - 7.3. 8.3. - 7.3? - 8.3. - See? Now you can go like this. Can you see my mouth... Beginner. Interme... Nice work. Keep it up. Hello? - Hello? - Hey. Alex? Yeah, what, did you forget my voice already? Why are you calling me from a blocked number? Because you don't answer my calls. All I wanna do is say hi, see how New York is. Okay. I told you I needed space. Oh, what, I'm smothering you again? You are unbelievable. You act like I'm the bad guy. You're the one who was seeing other people. For the last time, Alex, I wasn't seeing anyone. And we were on a break. Okay, whatever. I'm over it. I'm just calling to see how everything's going. Alex, we can't keep doing this. We can't keep talking like this. I can't even call you to say hi? So were we nothing then? Like we never happened? Look, we've been over this before. I just need to focus on myself right now. And maybe somewhere down the line we can be friends... but for now I just really need my space. So you move to New York and just forget everything else? Okay, fine. I'll just fucking forget you too. Have a nice fucking life, Emma. So mature. - How's Dad? Is he around? - No. He'll be back on Friday. - Oh, right. He's in Chicago, right? - Yeah, for the conference. But... oh, honey, you're breaking up. How about you? Feel like a New Yorker? I'm doing so good. It's so amazing here. I feel like I have a whole new sense of freedom. Oh, and I hung out with that guy, Michael, yesterday. We went all over New York. But we didn't do, like, touristy stuff, so it was really nice. You sound great, Em. So happy to see you like this. It's like the old Emma. Listen, I know I said you might not be ready for this... and things were a little tense with us when you left, but I was wrong. I'm sorry about all that. I am proud of you. Oh, Mom. I wanna hug you right now. I know, me... I wanna hug you right now. Hug you right now. Hug you... hug you right now. Stop doing that. You're insane. I can't. Oh, my God. Alex, what are you doing? Happy birthday, Emma. It's Emma's birthday. It's my birthday too. All right. I just got home, so I'll call you later, okay? - Wait, all your photos are gone? - No, not all of them. Just certain ones. I mean, ones with me and Alex, and Michael, and I don't know what else. - Does Alex have your password? - No. And he would never do something like this. I don't know. - Are you in my photo albums? - Yeah. - They're not in there, right? - No. Maybe their server got messed up or something. You're sure no one else has your password? No. I'm really careful about that stuff. - Wait. They just got back to me. - What'd they say? Oh, God. I have to change all of my passwords now. But you know what? I think I can make an exception for you. - Just don't tell anyone. Okay? - Okay. I really appreciate it. This thing is, like, my life. Oh, my God. Of course. Let's see. Is there anything else? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna need the administrative password... and your social security number, and that was just a dumb joke. - I don't know why I said that. - Okay. I'm just... yeah, but I'm gonna need definitely the password. Yeah, yeah. Hold on. Let me just write it down. - Oh, I'm Greg, by the way. - Oh, yeah. Hi, I'm Emma. - Emma, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - And thank you again so much. - Oh, yeah. It's no problem. - Should I close that? - Oh, yeah. If you want to. Okay. And it was only, like, certain photos that were gone. What was it, then? I don't know. My laptop was fine though. There's no viruses or anything... so I just have to be extra careful with my passwords now. That's super sketchy. I'm changing my passwords too. - Okay. I'm here. I'll see you later. - Have fun. Yeah, definitely. And with all the grants and everything, it should be pretty easy to get a job. I don't know, it's just super fascinating. I mean, so much is gonna change in the next 10 to 20 years. - Yeah. Also, robots. - Ha-ha-ha. Yes. Robots. Mm-hm. That's my roommate. He's pretty hilarious. You should meet him. Kent? Kent, come in here. He probably has his headphones in. Ah! Ha-ha-ha. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I didn't realize that you had company. - You're an asshole. - You should've seen your face, though. It was so sweet. I'm sorry. I'm Kent. I'm Michael's roommate. - Emma. Nice to meet you. - Not cool. Oh, come on, chill out. Oh, do you guys go to school together? - Yeah, we're in the same class. - Oh, economicals. Cool. Very cool. - Do you go to school? - No, I'm a bartender. I actually bartend a few blocks away. You should come in. Free shots on me. You can come too. Oh, thank you. That's the first time you're hooking me up. That's so nice. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Yeah. It's right back there. By the way, I'm going out of town for a few days... so you have the place to yourself. - Dude, what? Who is she? - That's the chick I told you about, man. Oh, my God. Tell me you got in there. I'm not. You barging in like a douche bag doesn't exactly help set the mood. She's so fucking hot. Please get in there. Okay, she's gonna hear you. Chill out. Would you please leave? Okay. Okay. But you know where the penis goes, right? - The penis goes in your mouth. - The vagina. It goes in your mouth. Yeah, I do know. - You need so much help. - I appreciate that. I'm probably gonna listen. You guys have been hanging out a lot. I know. I keep telling myself I can't fall into something. I can't fall into something. - Maybe just fall into his bed then. - Oh, gosh. No, I want to. It's just, I don't know, I feel like I should wait. Might be a little bit too soon after my ex. But Michael is awesome, right? And he's so cute. And he's really funny. God, again. I keep getting these weird text messages. - From who? - I don't know. - They're all from a blocked number. - What does it say? It says, "you never told me how you were doing." I mean, I get weird texts too sometimes... from people who are, like, dialing the wrong number. That's it, that's it, that's it! Bye bye birdie, he got in four. Sound on for the home team.

Hi, this is Patrick from financial services. Message skipped. Next message. Hey, Em. It's Mom. Give me a call when you can. I'm planning Thanksgiving... and I forget what days you have off. Love you, bye. Oh, my gosh. He's so cute. I've wanted a cat for so long. - You should get one. - Been thinking about it. I had two amazing cats growing up. Winkle and Oreo. Winkle? - Love, 15. - Your noises are really distracting. I'm sorry. Oh, oh. Stop. Eh. You sound like you're gonna throw up. I am. Hah! - Stop your noises. - Strong rally. Does the more forceful I do it make it more forceful? - No. - I don't wanna throw my shoulder... - Game, set, match. - Again. Once again. I'm the best. - Not fair. - I won again. I think maybe we should slow down. I don't want to, but I just... - I think that we should. - Yeah. Totally. There's no need to rush things. Cute. My dad got it for me when I was little. It reminds me of home. Hello? Hello? Finding your location. You're near eighth street and university place. We are looking for someone to lead it, a grad student. And I thought of you right away. Now, it's a great opportunity, but do not feel obligated. But if it's something that might interest you... I could recommend you to the department. Wow. Wow, thank you. I'm so flattered. No pressure. If you need some time to think about it, that's fine. - Take your time. - No. Yeah, I'm definitely interested. I just wanna make sure that I have the proper time. Yeah, good. So how are you settling in? I think he was flirting with me. - No way. - No, I'm serious. He kept telling me to call him Chris. - Is he cute? How old is he? - Nicole, come on, he's like 50. I mean, it sounds like an easy A. Well, maybe I should introduce you to him. Maybe you should. I have a thing for older men. - Shit, I gotta run. Talk to you later, okay? - All right. Bye. You've got to be kidding me. - Hey. - Hey, girl. I'm so glad that you called, I was just... I'm living with Michael right now and he just sent me porn. Whoa, kinky. No, awkward. He just sent it to me out of nowhere. Yeah, that's a little weird. - He just told me that I make him nervous. - What? What does he mean? I don't even know how to respond to this. I mean, I'm just saying, "that's nice of you to say." Where's he going with all this? - What the hell? - What? What now? "I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time." What is this guy's deal? - Wait, he just sent me another link. - Here we go. Okay, this is getting super weird. He just sent me a video of me from high school. Really? This guy's all over the place. Holy shit, I totally forgot about this. My mom posted this, like, forever ago. Why did he send it to you? - I don't know. - How weird. - I just asked him how he found it. - Can't wait to hear this. - "You can get anything on the Internet." - Whoa, okay, creeper alert. What is he doing? Why were you sending me weird shit? Wait, wait, wait, what? I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not even online. Okay, are you serious? Is this a joke? It's not funny, I was just talking to you. Okay, first of all, calm down. I haven't touched my computer all night, so I don't know what's going on. - Well, then who was it, Michael? - I don't know. Are you sure it came from my e-mail? Yes, the one that we always talk on. Okay, hold on, I'm checking now. It wasn't from me, so... Someone got into my account. What? No. No, this person knew stuff about me. - Whatever, this is so weird, I gotta go. - Hold on, wait, hold on. Didn't you get hacked a few days ago? What if someone hacked into my account... like, to fuck with you or something? I don't know. - I gotta go. - Really? What, you don't believe me... Hey. Can we talk? Yeah, no, now's not really a good time. You know, I changed my password and everything on my computer. I might actually get a new one. So... Yeah, yeah, that's good. Look, I'm not trying to blow you off, it's just this whole situation is scaring me... and there's just a few things I have to figure out, okay? Yeah, totally. All right. Yo, Felipe, hold up. Hey. Be careful about who you meet out there. You really think it's some rando? I don't know. I changed my privacy settings on everything. I'm gonna change my number when my new phone gets here. I'm not giving it out to anyone. I mean, don't take this the wrong way, but you kind of jump into things fast. - Yeah. - And Michael could just be another Alex. I know, but now I feel like I can't trust anyone. Did you make sure your bank account is okay? Yeah, it's fine. I called and told them to flag my account for any weird activity... and I'm gonna install this antivirus program thing that I bought. - Fifty dollars down the drain. - That sucks. Please enter your password. You have one new voice message. First voice message. Emma, it's Chris Williams. Haven't heard from you in a while. Not sure if you got the e-mails I sent you... but your fellowship interview got bumped to tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. I'd get there a lit... Message erased. End of new messages. I just don't know why they're doing it. Is there anyone you pissed off back home? I don't think so. No, and if I did piss someone off, why can't they just say it? Why are they hiding behind all this bullshit? Who the hell knows? Let's just have fun tonight, okay? - We need to get our drink on. - Yeah, I need to clear my head. I don't know why I've been talking about this. Exactly. How does this look? Hot. Okay, you ready? Can you take a picture of us? - You girls want a picture? - Yeah. All right, say "gorgeous." - Wait, it's not working. - Let me see. Let me put my number in first, it's the least I can do. Give me the phone. I don't want your number. Just so you have it, you know. You can call me anytime. And done. - Do not tell me this works on other girls. - I won't. Okay, well, we'll call you later so you have our number too. Oh, I just deleted your number. Weird. - Oh, my God. - Let's go. Let's eat something. I guess we're on our way, but we can probably... - I want a muffin. - Mm. A muffin. I have it all over me. This cab is moving. - Now it's like an old lady. - It's moving. I'll make you look fucking fabulous. I'm gonna do a song for everybody, but... Your laugh is killing me right now. Fuck. Two rings, you let down, got that? One ring up, two rings down. - One for up, two for down. - Beautiful. Glad I got through fifth grade... so I can understand these very, very complicated procedures. He's not very used to lions. Good-for-nothings. How about you, my little friend? Nicole, I just got home and my door wasn't locked. I never do that. Should I call the cops? Wait, hold on. Maybe you left it unlocked in a rush or something? I don't think so. Shit, I don't remember. - Where are you now? - I'm outside. Okay, take a deep breath. You wanna just pop your head in? - I'll stay on the phone. - Okay. - Everything all right? - Yeah. - Everything looks fine. - Okay, that's good. - You all right? - I don't know. Okay, I'm just gonna check the rest of the apartment. Okay. God, I probably just left it unlocked. Does anything feel weird in there? I'm not sure, I'm still looking around. Do you want me to just come over? You sound kind of freaked out, I feel like I could help. Hold on one second. - Just stay with me, okay? - Okay. Emma? Emma? Emma, are you there? Emma! - Hey, sorry, I dropped my phone. - Holy fucking Christ. Everything's fine, nothing's missing. You scared the fucking shit out of me. I'm probably just crazy. I just... I've been so stressed out lately. Crazy easy, really rich and nice. Just brush it on, good to go. Second one we're gonna make, whole-grain mustard, some sage... and a little bit of rice wine vinegar. Again, maybe one part: Mustard, one part honey. A teaspoon, tablespoon of rice wi... Hey. What are you doing here? I mean, how'd you get up here? Someone let me in, but I brought you something. - Is that a cat? - Is this a cat, what? No. Maybe. God, I don't believe you. - I know it seems crazy... - Yeah, it is crazy. Well, I thought you could use some company, you know... something to help take your mind off of things. They said you could take a day or two with him... and see if you guys are a good fit. His name is Clover. Clover, I want you to meet Emma. Yeah. This is your new roommate. - Clover, come here. Come here. - Come here. Clover. Come here, bud. Oh, he's using the restroom. Potty trained. He's using the bathroom. Make sure to put the seat up when you're done. Or down. - Down. You train them so fast. - I know. I'm the cat whisperer. - You think you're really clever, don't you? - What? Me? No. Okay, what am I supposed to do? I'm not supposed to be paranoid? No, I completely get it. Honestly, I do. You know, I actually got you something else. I was hoping maybe you could go to the ballet with me. Thank you. Get it, Clover. Come here. Hey. Hey, Emma, look, I don't want you to get freaked out... but I just got a threat. - Wait, what? - An e-mail. I think it's the same person that's been harassing you. Michael, what do you mean? It's from my own e-mail, which is crazy because I just changed the password. It says, "do not talk to her again. You are nothing, you are nobody. You do not know what I'm capable of." Um... I'm gonna call the police. There's nobody you can think of that might be inclined... to do something like this? - Maybe an ex-boyfriend? - No. That's the problem, it's been anonymous this whole time. Okay. There's a number you can call to get a copy of the report. Let us know if anything else happens. That's it? There's not much we can do. A crime wasn't committed. There's no aggravated harassment. If it escalates, you can call us again. Look, my friend Michael has been threatened. Ma'am, I'm sorry. I understand your frustration, but this isn't a credible threat. We get calls like this all the time. We can't pursue every one of them. I just don't feel safe. It's probably some 14-year-old shithead in South Dakota... who has nothing better to do. I wouldn't let it freak you out too much. I mean, it's weird, but... He decided to mess with me randomly? I mean, how did they get my number? Someone banged on my door in the middle of the night, remember? I am so paranoid now. I just feel like some freak is gonna grab me wherever I go. Oh, honey, it's definitely creepy... but who knows if that's the same person, right? I mean, the banging on the door thing, that could be an accident... or some drunk idiot maybe? I know you're freaked out, I get it. Thank you so much for everything. That's what I do. And if anything else happens, I'm gonna go out there and kick their ass. All right, I just got home, so I'll talk to you later, okay? - Don't forget. - All right. Clover? Hey there, you got Michael. Leave a message. Hi, Michael, please call me as soon as you can. Oh, honey, the cat was from the shelter. It could have been sick. Who knows? He was fine when I left him. He was running around, he was eating. I just... I don't understand. He could have choked on something, that's not your fault. God, why is all this happening to me? - What do you mean, "all this"? - What's going on? Emma, is something else going on? No, no, I'm fine. No, I don't think you're fine, Emma. I can tell when something's wrong. - Is it school? - Come on, Emma. Look, I didn't wanna tell you guys because I don't wanna worry you. - What? - I think that someone's been stalking me. - Stalking? What? - What? What do you mean? I've been getting calls and e-mails, and my friend Michael was threatened. - Threatened? - What do you mean, threatened? Emma! Why didn't you tell us this? Because I thought that... I don't know, I thought that I could figure this out on my own. - Honey. - I just... - I didn't want you guys to worry about me. - We're flying out there. We'll find you a new place to move. We're gonna talk to the po... Hey there, you got Michael, leave a message. - We're flying out there. - We'll find you a new place to move. No. God, this all came out of nowhere. It's like a nightmare. - We're flying out there. - Michael threatened. - Emma. - I don't understand. - What am I supposed to do? - Move. Do not talk to her again, you do not know what I'm capable of. I think that I need to move. I just feel like some freak. Some freak. I know it's you, you fucking freak. - Hello? - Alex, have you been fucking with me? - Do not lie to me. - What? What are you talking about? Have you been hacking my shit or prank-calling me? Hacking your what? Get over yourself, Emma. First you tell me to leave you alone... and now you accuse me of some bullshit? Like, what? Alex, please just tell me the truth. Are you serious right now? The world doesn't revolve around you, okay? - Never mind. I'm sorry that I called. - Whatever, Emma. - Hey. - Hey, you all right? Um, I'm at the coffee shop. I just... I couldn't stay in my apartment, I just felt trapped. So I guess I'll meet you at your place later? Yeah, I can't get out of here until 10 now, though. Computer system's all messed up. Everyone's freaking out. Are you gonna be okay? I don't know. I just feel like someone's watching me. Don't worry about it. Nothing's gonna happen with all those people around. I'll just meet you at your place tonight, then we can cab it to my apartment. Okay, I'll let you get back to work. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Hey, sweetie, you okay? I'm just so frustrated. I'm trying to do my work but I just... I can't concentrate. Just don't worry about your work tonight, just try to relax. Nicole's still coming over, right? Yeah? What about Michael, have you talked to him yet? No. I haven't heard from him, so I'm getting kind of worried. Oh, honey, listen, I'm gonna be there tomorrow. We are gonna talk to the police, we are gonna go to campus security... and we're gonna find you a new place to live. We're gonna find a place with a doorman, okay? Yeah. I've already started looking at a few apartments, so... Oh, Emma, what happened? - Mom, I don't know what... - Emma? - I don't know what just happened. - Honey, it's probably just a fuse that blew. - Oh, my God. - Emma, you're scaring me. Emma. I can't... honey, I can't see you now. What is that? - Okay, I'm calling 911. - Leave me alone! - Oh, my God! - Leave me the fuck alone! - Emma! Emma, no! - No! Please, my daughter is being attacked. What are you doing to her? No, she's not here, she's in New York. Please help her! Get the fuck away from her! She's not here, I'm just... I'm on the computer. Oh, my God! Please help me! He's hurting her! Get the fuck away from her! Emma! Where's the address? I can't find the fucking address! I can't find the address. I can't find it, I can't find it. Please, don't hurt her! Don't hurt my baby! She's 23 years old. It's Emma, my baby girl. Who the fuck are you? What are you doing to her? Oh, my God! I have it, I have it, I have it. It's 8... 8... 854 Wilson Avenue, apartment 4A... in New York. In Brooklyn, New York. Please hurry, it's my baby. Please hurry. Where are you? The police are on their way. Please don't hurt her! Emma, the police are coming. She didn't do anything. Emma, please, talk to mommy. Talk to mommy, please. Please. I beg you. Emma? Emma? Oh, my God! Emma? Please! Please don't hurt her!
