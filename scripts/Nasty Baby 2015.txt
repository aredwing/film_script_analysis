Yeah, I live in Soho still. I have not been out here in a very, very long time. I had an old friend that lived out... - Wow! - Welcome. This is home. Wow. It's a jungle! I know, right? It's my boyfriend's obsession. He gets one every other day. Yeah, you want some coffee, water? Uh, water. Water would be great. - Oh... - Here. Nice yard. Thank you. This is my cat, Sula. - I'm a little allergic... - Oh, sorry. No, no, no. It's okay. Sula... So, yeah, now, like, this is where I live and work. Mm. - I don't really... - Jennifer. Oh, yeah. - Jennifer... - You're a fan? No. Come on, it's a joke. She looks so beige. - She is beige. - Right? She looks like bread. Mm. Uh, yes, and I was telling you, like, I feel that I don't need that much space anymore, so... God! But space, Freddy. Look what you can do with space. There you are. And where are you going? What are you doing going into video? - It's not like... - What is this? No, but it's not like an extreme decision, like that. I just, like, when you told me about this group show, it just felt, kind of like a great opportunity to explore... Why? Tell me. Tell me why is Dirty Baby right for identity and heritage? - Why? How? - It's... it's Nasty Baby. Nasty Baby. Oh, that's much better. - It's better, right? - It's much better. Yeah. It's more catchy, but I feel that, yeah, like... So, I've been trying to, uh, make a baby with my best friend, uh, for the last six months. And so, since we start, I've been obsessed with the idea that eventually there's gonna be a creature that resembles me, - and is made out of my genes. - Oof! And like, it's so... It's such a selfish act to just keep on making babies when there are so many that you can adopt... - But you want it. - But now I want to. - You want it! - Now I want to. And then I feel so guilty about it, that I feel that I need to pay a price. And the price is to go through the embarrassment of me portraying a three-month-old baby... - I love that one. - Yeah, so these are pictures of me when I was a baby. - That's you? - When I was a nasty baby. - Oh, look at you. - Yeah, like, go back to this time, you know, and portraying this sort of, like, gross cuteness. Tell me if... if we were to... if you were done, and we were pulling up tomorrow to load in at this show, what am I seeing? - So, I'll be fully naked - Oh! - against a black background. - Oh, okay. - A black infinite background - Okay, okay. performing... I can show you. It's really embarrassing. - Please. I would love it. - But, yeah, it's part of... Should I... Do you wanna get ready, or...? No, no, no. No, I'm not gonna get naked now. - Okay. - But I'll show you how it is. - I'm ready. - Okay, I'm ready too. You're never ready for this... - Okay, so... - Oh. Basically... Okay, imagine if black infinite background no music at all, super raw. And then, on video, doing something like this... Ooh... Put your left hand up. Left hand. - How you doing? - Fine. How's your camel toe hanging? It's good. How's your loose butthole? You got it. There's no place... Here. This one's so easy. Yes! Oh, my God! - You're almost there. - - Yeah! Wait! I have to touch it. I have to touch it. You guys had a... I'm so proud of you. I'm so... Be careful. Mom, look. Mom! Shit. I'm getting better now. I had this meeting with this gallery, and I promise this is what I showed him at my place. I was, like, rolling around like a disgusting baby. - Funny, right? - It's funny. I just got an e-mail from my doctor. Your sperm count is lower than we thought. - So... - Oh, no. It's not gonna work. It's kind of why it hasn't been working. Aw, I know. I'm sorry. - It sucks. - No, it's... - I'm sorry I wasted your time. - You didn't waste my time. We tried, like, five months with my lousy semen. Are you kidding? It's not lousy, it's just not... - Low. - It's just low. So, yeah. So, now we just have to try to figure out the next step, - because time is kind of... - What is the next step though? I don't know, your brother? I'm just kidding. - Chino? - I'm kidding. - That's gross, man. - 'Cause he's young, maybe... Yeah, amazing cum. Um... What about Mo? Yeah, Mo is... It's always been an option. - Yeah. - I mean, like, he knows. - Yeah, I think. - He's waiting for the results, too. - So, you'll talk to him? - Yeah, I'll talk to him. Today? - Today? Yeah. - Yeah. I just wanna get it done, you know. I wanna, like, keep moving. Yeah, I'll talk to him. You wanna, like, try for the next time you're ovulating? Yeah, why not? Ooh, boy. I'm gonna go change. Should we, like, leave? - Yeah, let's go. - Okay. I can't get out. - What do you mean? - I can't get out. - What do you mean? - Oh, my gosh! Freddy, please help me! Oh, sorry, no, I was just kidding. - I know. - Oh, baby, I'm sorry. I know. It's... it's okay. I don't wanna cry over it. It just, like... So, basically Polly said that, uh, if you could, uh... if you could decide soon whether, uh, you wanna be the next sperm donor... How... how soon? Um, I don't know. She said tonight, but she didn't mean... - She said tonight? - Tonight that I ask you, not that we tell her. Whatever, it's like... I think she wants to do it before the next ovulation period, which is within two weeks. - Is that crazy? - Well... I mean, is this... Why are you feeling so hesitant? I don't feel hesitant. It's not... I'm not... I'm not against it. I just don't wanna... It'd be so amazing if you could, man. Some people can't. - I have to think about it. - Mm-hmm. - But... - And I will tell her maybe - Tell her to... - before she ovulates again? Tell her that she will ovulate again. - She will. - Eventually. - Eventually. It's not... - I know, I know. - Yo... - Hey, Mo. What's going on? How are you, buddy? May I ask you how much the three ivies in the front are? Those are 25. Twenty-five, all three of them? The one in the end? Oh. Uh, it's so painful. It's so painful. Look at them, dude. - I've been one of those couples. - Really? - Yeah. - The complaining about food... No, no. Just like the awkward dinner thing The super silently. Never bring me here again. Oh, no. I wanna rescue that poor woman, dude. Dude, this plant is heavy. Why am I carrying it? You're so strong. Thank you, baby. You got it. - Hey, Richard. - - Oh, help is here. Let us do it.

I don't wanna even get into it. He bullshitted me out of a dollar. Just now? Yes, just when I parked. He pretended to be helping me, and that was all bullshit. If you help me get the apples out of the vehicle, I will give you a wonderful libation when we get inside. - Can I just put these here? - Of course. Anywhere you can get them. I appreciate your help. - Freddy! - Go inside, go inside. - Where'd you go? - I was lugging the bags. Babe, your plant. I'm going to make us gin and tonic. One-one. "Mayor of Adelphi Street"? Yes.

I don't think you guys understand, like... It's not the putting it in, it's the disappointment every month. Like, getting the rejection, saying that it's negative every fucking month. It's, like, I just... I don't know. I came here tonight, and I thought this was gonna work. And your sperm tested so well, and I was so excited. And I was like, "Okay, finally, we're fucking doing it." It's not a decision to be made lightly. - I know. Well, then... - You know, it's my life too. It affects my life too. Yours isn't working. I'm sorry, it's just not. No, that I know. And it's not just like, "Oh, let's keep trying. Oh, let's keep trying." This is... I don't have, like, a lot of time. - I understand, Polly... - No, you don't understand. - No, I do. I'm sorry. - No, you don't, Freddy. - Actually, you don't. - Hey. All right, I'm sorry. I'm just gonna go. Good night. Polly, Polly. Polly. You like that lamp, right? Um, yeah. Excuse me. No. You threw it out, Polly. Oh, no, I didn't... I didn't throw it out. I just couldn't carry it... I picked it up off the street. Don't lie. No need to lie. Sorry. - Why you gonna lie, Polly? - Calm down, please. I'm just... - You're making me feel uncomfortable. - You're a pretty girl, Polly. Why you be hanging out with them faggots? - Master Bishop. - Oh, here comes one now. Why do you keep invading this young lady's space? - Shut up, you old faggot. - - Stop it. You're always crossing boundaries. - The old-school faggot. - People have boundaries. Run along. Bye-bye. Good night, Polly. - Bye. - Good night. I'm sorry about that.

Get the fuck out of here. - Is he here or not? - No, he's not here! Go! - Freddy, let's go. - Oh, my God. There are more people. They're staring at us. Whoo! - Oh, good job. - What is that? - What the hell? - Oh! No, this is a fucking festival. It's the best... Ugh! Stink bombs. Yeah! Where the fuck did you get this from? He's like, "I have 25 cents." - I'll get a stink bomb. - What do I get? Guys, make sure you use the napkins. Make sure you use the napkins. No, because it'll get everywhere. On the hand. Yeah, coming out of his belly. - It's like a horse... - You don't want... No, no, no. Don't light that. Don't light that. Don't smoke. It's bad for your sperm. - Polly, give him a break. - It's my birthday. - Is it bad for your sperm? - Yeah, it is, but maybe tomorrow. It's my sperm's birthday too. A knight. Okay... Oh, dude! Why don't we go throw the stink bombs to the Bishop's eden. Stop that. Why don't we go throw the stink bombs to The Bishop's place? Come on. Mo, you into it? I'll totally go. This is revenge. We're doing this for you. - For real. - Shh. Shut up. Fuck. - Shh! - Come on. Let's enjoy the revenge. There's nothing to enjoy. Come on, don't lie. You like this idea. This is gonna be crazy. Is he putting it inside? One, two... Oh, my God. What the fuck! Hell, no! Oh, my gosh. That's a kid. There's a kid inside. Oh, my God. Freddy... All of you, shut up! There's a fucking kid. That is not cool. What the hell did you do? Oh, my God! This is fucked up. Yeah, it's kind of not that funny. No, it's not funny. I'm leaving. I don't like this. Wait. Are you really leaving? I don't wanna hear. I don't like this. Good night. Guys come on, let's get out of here. - Hey, guys. What's up? - - Hey. - Hey, man. - How was it? Not so good. Why were you throwing that stink bomb that... Hey, guys. You can stay. Like, for real, stay. We're gonna go to bed, but just stay. Hang out. - No, no, no. - No, for real. - I mean it. I mean it. - - Okay. - Can you sing something... - Uh, sure. Here now, like this. - Fucked it up. - I fucked it up. Well, you start it. Do you know how to start it? No, I haven't done it in years... Oh, yes. Yeah. I can do that. I can get that. Babe, what are you doing? Hey, come back! - What the fuck is your problem! - Hey! Back off! Go away! - Uh-huh. - Hey! What the fuck is your problem? Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's going on? He stopped me from cleaning the streets. No, he harassed my friend sexually last night. - Argh! - Wait, wait, wait. What're you talking about, sexually harassed? I just saw him with the leaf blower. What is he sexually harassing? He harassed my friend last night. - I didn't harass nobody! - - Yes, you did. Bishop, take a minute. Take a minute. You know me. Take a minute, take a minute. Chill out, chill out. What's going on? This man sexually harassed our friend last night. She was walking to our apartment, and he grabbed her. - Negro! - Okay, Bishop. Bishop. Okay, now take a minute, all right? Hold on. Hold on for a sec. What else is going on? Why did you take the leaf blower from him? The leaf blowing is, like, every morning. I call 3-1-1. It's not legal before 8:00 a.m. Nobody cares about that. It's noise. He's assaulting people on the street. - Okay... - Those fucking bitches threw a fucking bomb in my apartment! - Oh, yes, you fucking did! - - Terrorists! - Did you hear me? - Osama bin Laden! Yes, I did hear you ma'am. Calm down. It's not a bomb. It was a stink bomb. It's a joke thing. Okay, first of all, I don't wanna hear anymore about bombs. I don't want you to be blowing their sleep, Lord Bishop. Now, take a walk. Go now. Go down the street. Go on. Take your girlfriend with you. - There's a fucking kid in there. - I know that. Go on with him. - That's okay for him to get in your face like that? - No, it's not. - You watch him. - You all know he's not dealing - with the whole deck, right? - You ought to arrest him. - He just threatened you with... - Listen, he's... he's crazy. Everybody knows he's crazy, right? So even if you try to press charges, all they're gonna do is put him in some crazy house, and they're gonna let him out in a couple of days. But listen to me. That house where he's staying at is gonna be sold in a few days, all right? And he's gonna be out of here. And there's nothing you can do about it, 'cause his mom is a judge. - What's this... - Oh, Judge Judy. - We don't need any sarcasm. - Yeah, right. So your mommy's a judge, and then you can be a criminal? Okay, sir. I'm just bringing up a point. He's up on De Kalb all the time attacking people. - This happens every week. - It's all the time. Something needs to be done. One thing is that he's crazy. He's crazy, put him in a... He's gonna be okay. I'm gonna talk to him. - Yeah, thank you. - - Thank you, officer. I'd say every five hours. - Five hours? - Yeah, pour a little bit. The cactus as well? Like, every plant is the same one? No, the cactus, you don't need to do anything to the cactus. Chino, the second one is "C," right? "C"? Ah, the second one, yeah. - And then you go to E minor. - Okay. Come on! So what is this again? You don't have to worry about that. Do me a favor. When you get about 50 miles out, give me a call to tell me everything's all right. - You're not having any problems. - I will. Okay. - All right. - See you. - Safe journey to all of you. - Bye. - Have a good time. - - Thanks for the ride, Richard. My ex-boyfriend, like he wanted to go to my country house and they wouldn't allow me because the neighbors were not cool with it. - Are you serious? - Yeah. And then I got into a huge fight and then I'm like, "Listen, when you think of me and my boyfriend, you just go like this." Cock, ass hole. Cock, ass hole. And my Mom said, "Oh, my God. He knows." - You said that to your Mom? - Yeah. I went like this in front to of her. Your Mom did not say he knows. No, she did not say he knows, but... They were amused. He knows. Okay, I don't want you guys to think this is weird. But I brought my kit with me. Because I'm ovulating today. - You're ovulating again? - Yes. Not again. You always say again like I'm ovulating everyday. You're like a chicken or something. Can I listen to some music? - Yeah, play that song. - This is the song that I'm learning. Hi, mommy. How are you? I'm fine. Hey, everybody! They're here. Oh, my gosh. They're here. - Hi. - Hi. - Jeremiah. - Hi, hi. Polly. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Hello! Good to see you. Oh, Jeremiah. How are you? Good to see you, man. - Good to see you again. - Good to see you. Oh, my God. Look at you. - Baby, you're good? - Yeah. This is Freddy. It's a pleasure. Freddy. Nice to meet you, finally. Oh, this looks great. - Oops! Sorry. I'm sorry. - That's good. There. Just put the potatoes right here, sweetie. Aw. Then we all ran because we didn't want to be beaten. And then we hid in the woods and then we actually got lost in the woods. Yeah and I went crazy. Are you still close with your cousins? You still talk to them? Yeah, I talked to Howard. My cousin's like one of my best friends ever. And if the timing of this works out, it would be so nice to have... Because you're due very soon, you know. They could grow up together. They'll be the same age. It would be so nice. - Yeah. - I like that idea. - You know. - Well, I mean you guys are in New York, so it's gonna be a little bit hard to, like get 'em together. - Yeah, but... - It wouldn't be that hard. We could come. I have cousins that don't live right there. We make time. Yeah, we can come here. How often do you come, Mo? Come on. I'm here now. I come often here. If I had a kid and you had a kid, we would come. We would make the trip. If I had a kid? I'm having this kid. Mine is not a mystery. Okay, if I had a kid. - Mine is coming. - Our children will be playing. It sounds so nice. You don't look so excited. I'm excited. What? Do I not look excited? No. I just... Okay. Well, you guys are trying it out in a different way, you know. Maybe there's a reason it hasn't happened yet. - That's all. That's all I'm saying. - Babe. What? Babe, what? Don't babe me. What is... What does that mean? I mean, like... - I don't know what I mean. I don't know. - What do you mean by it? - I think you do know what you mean. - You do know what you mean. I mean, how like how is this thing gonna work? How you guys gonna... Maybe this is really... Maybe this is really normal in New York. - But... - Why can't you just be supportive? I have been nothing but supportive. But this isn't... This isn't one of your little like, schemes, like you moving off to the big city and you know deciding you're gay and... I mean this is a kid. You're bringing a child into the world. I think you should put a little bit more thought... Yeah, they're thinking of bringing a child into a world with three parents that love that child. I can assure you, a mom and a dad does not create that all the time. I mean, I've seen situations where kids have a mom and a dad and then mom's an alcoholic or dad that beats up the mom... Nobody is talking about... I'm talking about that though. I'm just saying... My point is that there's no normal situation at all. Reggie, don't go. I guess what we're trying to say is that not... You need a mom and a dad but you need a loving mom or a loving dad. - Yeah, that's all I was saying. - - It's more about how we are. Stability. That's... Mo's voice, again. - Make a wish for a baby. - A baby. - And then as a consequence I was pissed off. - Oh, my gosh. Just a annoyed little child. Look, you're just holding a pair of sunglasses. You're so adorable, your face. Mo, look at you there with a dog! Look at your white boots. I know. - Oh, my God. I can't take it. - That's my favorite. No. I want one. I want one that's half of that and half of me. Oh, we want it. Oh. - Come on now, put it in. - Come on, do it. Do it. Mo, you're so cute and sweet. Mo, we would make such beautiful little friendly creatures. All right, let's do it. Really? - Yeah, let's do it. - Like right now? - Yeah, right now. - Like I go get my kit right now? Yeah, do it. - Are you serious? - Go get it. - Go get it. - Oh, my God. Before he changes his mind. Before I change every single part of my mind. Gross. Oh, my gosh! Let me get you started. Dude, she's so excited. Are you serious, you wanna do it? - Yeah. - Don't fucking get cold feet now. Did you already start? - It's... It already happened. You missed it. - No! Just rub yourself against that wet spot and... Okay, babe. It's all good. Okay. Listen, this is very serious. You know what this means. Yes. And don't contaminate the specimen. Okay, hold it. Easy, easy, easy. - You're good. - Yeah. It's warm. Ew. Polly, just do it. You need help? Let me help you. - Do you want to hold my legs up? - Yeah. Hold on, one second. - Yeah, lift me up here. - - Wait. Okay, we have to think positive thoughts. And tell the sperm to go right to the egg. Yeah. Babe, show her the picture with you and the dog. That one. Oh, my God. Wait, wait. Hold it up. Oh, shit. Goodnight, kid. - Goodnight, Ceci. - - Goodnight. Good vibes, you guys. Good job, babe. Thank you. - Mm. Thank you so much. - Oh, thank you for being here. - Come to New York, you promise? - We will, I promise. - And cross your fingers for... - Yeah. Fingers are crossed over, and the prayers are up. Okay. Thank you. Bye, nice to meet you. Thank you so much for everything. Come to New York. Bye, sweetie. - Take good care of yourself. - I will. Bye. Bye, bye. - Can I make a left here? - - Yeah. - Have a good night. - - Good night. - Bye. - - Bye. Okay, bye. You can go. I'm good. - Me too. Go. - Okay. Oh, what the fuck? - What the fuck is that? - - Is that human shit? - Someone took a shit on our stairs. - Oh, smells like it, dude. Under fucking light. How bad is that? - Oh, it's so humiliating. - I swear. - I'm just going to bed. - I wish I could. I feel unclean. Babe. - Leaving for the gallery. - Huh. Okay. Good luck at the gallery. Here we go. - Hi, excuse me? - Hello. Hi. Are you guys set up? Yeah, we have a meeting with Marcus. - Wendy. - Yeah. Come check this out. - Oh, I love it! - It's crazy, right? - Okay, let's go. - No, you love this. You love Michael. You have to. Hurry up. Make sure, it's, uh, on focus. - Hey. Hello. - Hey, you guys. - How are you guys? Great? - Ready. So want to get the lights, Jesse. Thank you. - Do you wanna hit the space bar? - - Yeah. Let's hit it. - Okay, this is gonna be working here? - Yeah. Okay. No, wait. That part is so good. Wait. One second. Okay, okay. Oh. - It's her. - - Who is that? Um, it's my friend Polly. The friend that I told you that, uh, that I was trying to have a baby with? - Sure, yeah. - And then Wendy was there. - You don't wanna finish it? - No, no. I do. We will. Can you hit the lights? Look, but... Yeah, hit the lights, Jesse. Thank you. - You don't like it? - No, I do. I do. - I like it. - Yeah? - Oh, yeah. It's just different. - Yeah, it's a little different than when we thought. It's a lot different. I know I just thought that it was... It would be more compelling for people at the gallery and maybe have a little stage. - Okay. - Down like, down below the... Spaces... It's a good show. - So you put it... - But we'll put it to the oracle. But is it gonna be part of it? Well, if you're kind of lucky. I can't... I'm... I don't make those decisions. The Oracle makes those. What do you mean? Who is the Oracle? - Are you teasing me? - No. I really don't know who you're talking about. Come here. You go first. You didn't like it, did you? You... What's going on? You just... I'm a little bit surprised, it's different. But this is where the decisions are made. What do you mean? - That's the Oracle? - This is. I mean, we light the candles. Just hit the question. Okay? In our hearts. Marcus, you really are not being serious. - Are you kidding? - What do you mean? How... How are you gonna consult to that whether I can be in the show or not? - Don't be tensed. - Okay. - The questions... - This is so weird. I don't get it. Don't be tensed. The questions are asked and the answers come. - But then how does the Oracle answer to your question? - Freddy. Freddy, the answers come. Okay? No, it's not okay. I just don't get it. Did you... Did you study Greek or Latin ever? Have you ever gone to high school, Freddy? Yeah, I went to high school. You don't need to get sassy, Marcus. - Sassy? - Yeah. Little cuteness party is sassy. That video is sassy. There's nothing personal about it. You talked to me about honesty and embarrassment just a short while ago in your place. You opened up something to me and you... You were blushing. Are you blushing now seeing that? Dude, I'm blushing now with this fucking Oracle thing, like it's... Honestly... Oh, you shouldn't say that. Yeah, maybe we should... We could go. I'm sorry, it's just so weird, I don't get it. You don't have to get it. That's the whole point. - There is nothing to do with the intellect... - Yeah, I don't get it. Yeah. And... and being cute and having all your friends have a fucking slumber party. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Excuse me. Okay? - Okay. Yeah, yeah. - This is not Picasso Baby. - Okay, this is not a gay... - Okay, don't compare me with Picasso Baby, okay. - What do you have all those people fucking for, Freddy? - That's a fucking service. Freddy. Let's just... We'll leave you can solve whatever... - No, dude. I'm not... I'm through. - Okay. Thank you. - Thanks, Marcus. - - Thanks. - Fucking asshole, dude. - I don't know. Let's just go. Hey, Chino. - Hey, What are you doing here? - Hi. Is... Is Mo here? - Yeah, he's in the office. - Okay. Mo. Hi. - Hey. - Hi. What's up? I'm coming by... 'cause I just... I found out that I am... Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much. Does Freddy know? No. I haven't told him. I, um, wanted to come here and tell you first in person. And just make sure that it's okay and we're okay and have your permission to... - My permission? - To go forward and... I just wanted to tell you in person. So, yeah, you sure you okay? We're good? Yeah. Yes. - Okay. - What's going on? Um... I'm pregnant. We're pregnant. What? That's amazing. Yeah. Hi-five. - Ow! - Oh, sorry. I'm a pregnant lady. You have to be careful. Let's go to the roof. - You think that was legit? - I don't know, man. I don't know. I just... Yeah. I don't know, Fred, it's... What do you mean? It's just, like... I don't know I don't think you handled that the best way. What do you mean, like? That was the proper attitude. The guy didn't even watch like 30 seconds of the video. - But... - And we worked so hard on that. - Excuse me. - Exactly, that's why we should have waited. - Excuse me. - Yeah. - Are you Jewish? - No. - What? - No, I'm not. No. - Are you sure you're not Jewish really? - Yes. - Are you a lesbian? - What? - Freddy, what are you doing? - No, dude. - Why? - Yeah, exactly. I'm sorry. What the hell was that? - Hey, Wendy. - - Nico. Hey. - Hey, what's up, man. - What's up. Hey, you guys want to come to a barbecue? I'm going now. - Yeah. You want... - No, no. I'm not... I don't want to. - Okay. I'm gonna go. - - Come on. Polly, wait a second. You're leaving? - Yeah. - Okay, sure. All right, I'll see you later. - Hey, what's up? - - Hi. How are you? What happened? It was just fucking humiliating. I'll tell you later. What's going on? Um, well, I have bad news, too. Um, it didn't work. No. But listen, I'm... I'm ovulating right now. So I'm thinking we just try it again tonight. I'm so upset. Yeah, why don't you talk to Mo about it? Yeah, I think it's possible. You just... Yeah, just talk to him. All right. Well, I'll see you tonight. - Okay. - Okay. Bye. - What did he say? - That I sound upset. - He had a bad day at the gallery today. - Yeah? Which will make this even better when we give him the good news. Hey, guys. Oh, hell no! Hell no! You know who this man is? This man is a fucking faggot. You go outside... He's your cousin but he sucks dick and takes it in the ass. Escape this fucking mess. Run away from this thing. Okay, I'm gonna be cool. I'm chilling out. I'm gonna be cool. I just wanna tell you something. The man is a terrorist. - Shut the fuck up, man. - - Shut the fuck up? Yeah, I'm not having a good day, like...

Let's get real. What's wrong? Don't look. Turn around. You go first. Freddy, there is a light switch on the left side of the wall. I'll be right back. One, two... Get away. Hi, I'm Michael Weinstein. My guest today is singer, song-writer, Ryan Bingham. His sound echoes the rough and rugged life he's led, but his journey is certainly magical. While working as a rodeo-rider he took up song-writing in his after-hours. He released two albums that cast the legendary producer, T Bone Burnett, who was producing the soundtrack to the Jeff Bridges film Crazy Heart. The rest is Grammy and Oscar history. Ryan Bingham, welcome to Song Trails. Thank you very much. I really appreciate you being here. I think your work is rather extraordinary in this time because it's a combination of... What was that? What? Wow. Can I stay here, please? Can I sleep here? - What? - Can I sleep here? What's going on? - Polly. - Hmm. What the fuck is this? - What is that? - Chino brought them. He gave them to me. Oh. Fucking creeped me out. - Aina. - Hey, guys. - Look who's here. - - Aw. How are you doing? Look who's here. It's uncle Freddy. How you doing? - Oh, God. He's like growing a beard. Look at that. - Hi. I know, he's getting so big, so fast. Where you guys heading? To get coffee. - Yeah, we're gonna go to... - - Where's Isaac? Is he back yet? Yeah, he got back late, had a long trip, just passed out. We're just out walking. - You look sleepy. - Yeah. Didn't really sleep.
