The first masseuse that came in looked exactly like Sam's dog so I asked for a replacement. The next one that came in was even worse. She looked identical to Sam. Can you imagine? Even I couldn't handle that. She had the audacity to ask me if she was pretty. Of course I said no. Then she clawed me. So I called you. That's when we messed up. You smashed the whole place up. It'll cost me a fortune in damages. So if a masseuse is ugly, you're definitely screwed. Why are you swearing at your boss? Nurse, it's not sore, is it? Yan... I asked you to do a small job. You don't have to be like that. You moan that I don't give you anything to do. You don't need to work in this business. If you want to work, why don't you go and be a cop? Do you know why I've only got you under my wing? It's because I like that you're focused. It's important to be focused. Look at Sam. He's focused, isn't he? As for what happened today... Don't let Sam know. Ever since his wife died, he hates us going to massage parlours. Why don't you let me go? Are you done talking? Get inside. Hey, don't push me, Officer. That's not the way to behave. Even cops shouldn't be like that. So are you going to tell on me? That's enough. That's life. Either you get me or I get you. Are you going to tell on me? Fuck off! - Don't fight! You're hitting your own boss? OCTOBER 2003 TEN MONTHS AFTER YAN'S DEATH File number IO143 - regarding the deaths of 27149, Officer Chan Wing Yan and 34689, Officer Lam Gok Ping. Internal Affairs have produced the following report. On November 26th 2002, Senior Inspector Lau Kin Ming of IA contacted undercover officer, Chan Wing Yan. With help from Officer Chan and from the OCTB unit in West Kowloon, Lau toppled Sam's drug operation and cocaine worth HK$60 million was seized. On November 27th 2002, Officer Chan met with Inspector Lau, on the rooftop of the Sei Fong Centre. Yan supplied information on triad moles. You can't get away. Just wait and see. You're going to kill a cop? I know all about you and Sam. You have no choice. Come back with me. Drop your gun. What do you want? - I want to get away. The preceding testimony was provided by Senior Inspector Lau Kin Ming. The committee Of two Chief Superintendents and the Assistant Commissioner unanimously believe Lau's testimony. Inspector Lau's killing of Officer Lam Kok Ping has been ruled legal. Lam has been confirmed as a mole sent by Sam into the police force. Finally, it's all over. You all believe me? It's all over. Stay in Admin for now, OK? Wait. Got it. Your parking space - wait three weeks. That's it. Bye. Officer Chan. Hold on. Your uniform's ready. Come and get it if you're free. Or I can send it over to you. No problem! OK. Bye. It's a shame Lam destroyed the CCTV. It's dragged on for so long. You know our bosses go on accountability. Luckily, you're one of us. It was all sorted quickly. You can come back to IA next month. Are you tired? If you are, you should go on holiday with Mary. Hello. OK. I'll sign the documents tomorrow. OK. We can split it. We can split anything but the baby! Hello, Officer Chan, your uniform's ready. If you're busy, I can send it over. I can do it. OK, wait for me. Bye. Have I done something wrong? I feel like beating someone up today. What's with all the fuss, Superintendent Yeung? These Taiwanese men are arms dealers. Their customers haven't shown up. They seemed bored, so I'm keeping them company. OK? Sure. I work in the Security Wing. I don't like to see respectable people coming here. You've got lots of men here. Help me out. That's difficult for me. Would this make it better? What? You want to set me up? Is that better? We've already written the report. That's half a kilo. Minimum eight to ten years. Get two of your men to come back with me. They're going to say they saw them take out some drugs. Being good citizens, they beat them up. I'll give them a Good Citizen Award. How about that? Good. Arrest them. Be polite. Sir, you can't go in. Step aside. Over there. Yeung Kam Wing, don't go too far. I've helped you all these years. Do you want me dead? If I go down, you'll suffer the consequences. Won't you give me a chance? ONE MONTH LATER Delivery from OCTB? I was transferred from OCTB yesterday along with the coffee. Have a seat. I've given coffee up. I need sleeping pills to get to sleep these days. I can't sleep if I drink coffee. Life is so unpredictable. I used to really hate Internal Affairs. And now, I've been transferred here. You don't seem to be very happy. I can transfer you elsewhere. Are you kidding? I moved here because of you. The files are on your desk. The first file... This sergeant killed himself in front of his ex-boss, Yeung. Internal Affairs is working on a few big cases. You know Security are very political. Everything is classified there. They won't answer any questions you ask. We found a letter on Sergeant Chun's desk. There was a tape inside. It was a conversation between him and Sam. It turns out he was Sam's mole too. Besides him, several officers have also committed suicide or vanished. They were all Sam's moles. The bosses say, after Sam's death, one of the moles is killing the others to keep his cover. Leung has ordered us to find out who he is. Do you know what happened? A package was sent to Leung. Guess what it contained. It had tapes of us giving tips to Sam. Luckily, Sergeant Chun was one of us. How many more of us are there? - Five, including you. Ronald, this is Inspector Lau. I've left something at Admin. Hello? I've found out something on Chun. He was in the Police Bowling Team. Wait. That's what you asked for. - Good. Thanks. Go on. He practised at the Lam Wah club. He rented his flat from Gam Dok Investments, which owns three big properties. The owner is Shen, a Mainlander. I'll e-mail you the information later. No, send it to me now. GARDEN, BROADCAST DRIVE Inspector Lau, I'm Yeung Kam Wing from Security Wing. I applied for a parking space. Let me check. I've waited a whole month. I don't want to bother you, but will it take much longer? Sorry, but I've moved back to IA. I know, but Admin asked me to contact you. Your application's been approved for a month. Here. Your parking space is B3A6. We haven't been able to reach you for a week. I've been off for a month. You know IA is investigating me. I know. - Are you investigating Admin today? No, I'm just picking up a uniform. That's a sergeant's uniform, Inspector. The man who killed himself in front of you wore it. I'm taking it back for investigation. Isn't the case closed now? Yes, or you wouldn't be back from your break. Thanks. - You're welcome. B3A6. Have we met before? No. Do you know someone called Shen? No. Mind your own business. We found these photos inside Chun's bowling locker. That's Shen in the photo. He used to be Sam's business partner. The man facing him is Security Wing's Yeung. He's connected to the sergeant's death. I think Yeung could be the mole. Hello? See you later. You're a good person. You come and see him the moment you get back. You're a good man. If it wasn't for you, he wouldn't be buried as a cop. It was my duty. I don't know why I helped him. I only knew him for about five months. I've only seen him 21 times. HE DIED BRAVELY HIS NOBLE SPIRIT IS ETERNAL He was a good cop. Anyone would have helped him. I'll give you a lift. Hello. I'm back. Let's get started. There are no triads in China. What China needs is wealth. Triads are all about life and death. Business is all about money. Today, we're here to talk business. But I'm a real triad. - No. To me, you're the best businessman. My brother said so too. We have HK$100 million to spend. We want to invest in your business. We'll ask no questions. It's one country, two systems. As long as money breeds money, we'll let you have full control. You still believe in that? You won't be able to refuse our Mainland ties. You think a Hong Kong triad can Out live a Mainland businessman? Without my brother's connections, your business in China won't last. Sam, you're a Buddhist, right? Amitabha. Is the feng shui good here? The best in Hong Kong. I want to get a longevity tablet here. For whom? For my wife. She died six months ago. And also one for myself. That's a small matter, I'll handle it. A small matter? - Yes. If it's such a small matter, let my men deal with it. We'll see how they handle it. Goodbye. Bye. Keung. You'll deal with his men. Are you kidding, Sam? I'm an idiot. Do you want it messed up? What does that laugh mean? Excuse me. Thank you. That's a lot. Are you jealous? Is it legit? Be careful. Don't worry, boss. You know how much money I have. Just ask if you want a loan. You don't need to threaten me. What's this? - It's for your baby daughter. You're a dad now. You should go home more. Don't work so hard. You've lost weight recently. None of your business. But thanks. Who are these two? I only know they're Mainlanders. Anything else? Shen was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi. He's been in the army. He dealt in antiques. He started from scratch, now he's loaded. He came to Hong Kong a year ago. His brother Liang joined him and does all the dirty work. Sam wants to expand to the Mainland. What did he want you to talk about? - Cooperation. Liang. - Yan. Sit down. Are you by yourself? You too, Liang? We have lots of nightclubs in China. They're all protected by local gang bosses. Influential people. Your goods can move around our network easily. We have businesses in 11 cities. Excuse me. Hello? - Well, how's the talk so far?. Not bad. See the ashtray in front of you? Pick it up and smash him with it. Hit him! Hit him in the head! I'm screwed. What is it? - Mary's pregnant. Congratulations. - But we're not married yet. Get married then. - Is that necessary? Or she can have an abortion. - We're already engaged. Hello? Got it. We can go. - Let's go. Long time no see, Wong. But I saw you last week with a girl in China. You don't have to shout. Security people are full of secrets. Stop for a minute. Hey, what's going on? What are you doing here? Hey! What's going on? What are you doing? Sorry, sir. We were asked to take some mugshots. I don't know what's going on either. I asked CIB to open a file and take a picture of everyone. Is that alright? Officers, are you done? Everybody's here. We were investigating Mr Shen... ..but we ended up being led to Sam by chance. We even arrested Sam's men. I'll let CIB handle the triads. Sam, long time no see. Are you OK? What brings you here? - I'm accompanying some friends. You Hong Kong Police are so inefficient. I'll speed it up then. He beat you up. Do you want to press charges? If not, then please sign here. I hit you. Want to press charges? You're crazy. Keung, let's go. Wait. Do you recognise me? I recognise you. Be careful. Wong. It's up to you what you do with them. It's OK. We all know each other. CIB colleagues, you can go now. Thanks, Ming. Thank you. Just doing my job. Let's go. What's your game? You think I'm playing? It's life and death. I'm glad you know that. Hurry up and thank me. Thank you for what? Look what you're doing. - Eating. You're eating shark fin. Shark fin, think about it. When Sam took me to Thailand, I had shark fin and then I moved up. You're having shark fin so you're moving up. Sam's mean, but he still bought you shark fin. Just think about it. Take him. Let go of him. Sam, are you letting them take Yan to China? Ask him why he smashed his head. He smashed his head? That's nothing. In this job, either you get them or they get you. Yan smashed his head, right? How about this? Is that alright now? Liang. Are you here to make a scene... ..or are you here for business? Go. Go! We're even now. Let's talk business. I heard you have a big arms business. If you let me chip in... ..the blood they have spilt will not be in vain. Sam. So? You're not happy with me? No. Have you ever met someone... ..who seems nice... ..but who might kill you at any time? I've met someone like that. What do you think, Sam? I'm wondering... ..why he didn't kill you. You'll look after the Mainland business from now on. Take this for now. Shen's not what he seems. Security is investigating him. He could be smuggling arms. Sam stopped all his deals in China. They're going to work together soon. That's a big deal. What should I do? Have you seen the shrink? Why should I see a shrink? I persuaded the Department Of Justice not to send you to prison. It's fine if you don't want to go. See you in prison. Bye. Hello? Hello? What's the address? Bye. I'm meeting with Dr Lee. This way. Are you planning to spend the night here? I can't fall asleep in my office. Unlike him. He said... ..ever since he became a mole... ..he could only fall asleep here. I still remember... That night... He said everything would be OK after tomorrow. And then he died. You're a doctor. Do you still have his file? He may be dead, but he's still a patient. Let's go. - OK. THREE HOURS LATER We found a letter on Sergeant Chun's desk. There was a tape inside. It was a conversation between him and Sam. The bosses say, after Sam's death, one of the moles is killing the others to keep his cover. He's connected to Chun's death. I think Yeung could be the mole. Do you understand what I said? Sorry. I won't sign it if she doesn't come and meet me. Do you understand? OK. My wife and I may be getting divorced. Did I scare you? Sorry. Be careful. Of what? Your car's next to mine. I drive badly. If I scratch your car, come and find me. I'm a good driver. You don't have to worry. The Taiwanese we arrested will be discharged next week. The Taiwan authorities have no comment. The Mainland police will come for extradition. I know their boss well. Stick to the plan and be careful. When they arrive, make them feel welcome and take them out for dinner and shopping. How about a nightclub? Macau is better. You're not afraid of reporters? We can cover their heads with bags. OK, you bring the bags. - What are you like? Superintendent Yeung. It's Sergeant Chun's memorial next week. We're all chipping in for a service. Do it properly. - Yes, sir. Back to the Mainland police. Talk to the Macau guys tomorrow. Let them plan the evening. I'll talk to them about security. If we don't plan, it'll be a mess. Then we won't have a good time. Anything to add to your testimony? No. Call us any time If you need anything. Thank you. Are you done? - Yes. Is it OK if I touch things? - Yes. OK, thank you. Is everything OK? It was like this when I came in. They stole some cash and watches. And the computer's gone. It's better this way. I can start from scratch. But the computer's useless to them. I locked it with my password. They won't know it's my licence plate number. Your eyes are all red. You haven't slept? I've been following several cases for days. You should get some sleep. OK. Everything will be OK after tomorrow. I'm off. Call me if you need anything. Mr Chan. AUGUST 16TH 2002 THE FIRST SESSION Mr Chan, I'm Dr Lee. I'm obligated to tell you that you've been ordered to undergo treatment. You should complete the treatment in six months. After that, I'll submit a report to the Court. The Court will use that to decide if you should go to prison. Prison? Isn't the treatment enough? You must follow doctor's orders during this time or the Court can revoke the sentence and detain you for handling. I see. Excuse me. Wong, you git. Dr Lee, you don't need to call the police. Just call me. You have my mobile number. I'll become a wanted criminal. THE SECOND SESSION Mr Chan, I'm Dr Lee. I'm obligated to tell you that you've been ordered to undergo treatment. You should complete the treatment in six months. You'll submit a report to the Court. They'll use this report and they might put me in prison. I get it. Please sign here then. We think you have a violent streak so we'll use hypnotism for your treatment. Hypnotism? You signed the form. Hypnotism? You can refuse it but the Court can revoke it. And lock me up? Alright, then. Hypnotize me. Hypnotize me now. Let's begin. Please introduce yourself. Talk about your family. Mr Chan? Mr Chan. Can you cooperate? I was practising just in case you couldn't hypnotize me. I can hypnotize myself for you. My will is really strong, you know. It's not easy to hypnotize me. I haven't started yet. Not yet. You want to know my story? My surname isn't really Chan. I was an illegitimate child. My dad sold drugs. I've been working since I was little. I earned HK$200,000 a month. I brought a Porsche at 17. I didn't have a Licence so I hired two drivers. This psychiatry thing is pointless. It's either the shrink or prison. She wants to hypnotize me. If I end up revealing everything, don't blame me. It's not that easy. She can't do it If you don't concentrate. It's tough not to concentrate. Dr Lee is a nice... ..person. You wouldn't understand. THE THIRD SESSION You're looking at the sky. There are lots of clouds. You're in the water. Your body is wrapped by the warm water. You feel a sense of weightlessness. You're floating on the water. Slowly open your eyes. The sky is close to you. Then... What are you doing? I'm hungry. My stomach will hurt if I don't eat. Are you finished? - Yes. Let's start. Can you see the sea? You're in the water. The water is really warm. It has wrapped round your whole body. Next, you feel a sense of weightlessness. You have a lot of tricks. Not really. I'm afraid of oversleeping during the hypnosis. It's best to set an alarm. It's not hard to remember. A Mercedes to Zhanjiang. A Land Cruiser... THE FOURTH SESSION Write it down if you can't remember! The speedboats definitely need new motors. Pink? We're smuggling, not sailing. My fax number is 21918125. No fax machine? Why did you ask for my fax number? E-mail? E-mail address? No e-mail. Sorry, I've been really busy. So are you done with your business? Let's talk about your family. You said your dad had three wives. You have 16 sisters. Let's talk about your twelfth sister. I haven't... Are you OK? Go away. - What's wrong? I haven't answered it. Better now? The report for the Court isn't important to me. I'm a doctor. I only want to cure you. If you don't want that, you can leave at any time. I've been wanting to tell you something. If you keep lying, I can't help you. THE... SESSION Dr Lee. Did I do anything else besides sleep? You don't remember what you've done? I do remember, but I'm not sure. Forget it. Bye. Dr Lee. I think you're especially nice to me. Do you fancy me? - You're delusional. Delusional? No wonder. Bye. What are you smiling about? Did she say you'll die tomorrow? You wouldn't understand. You think I'm delusional? Delusional? You are. Maybe all the hypnotism has made me delusional. That's... Hey, watch the road! - So many cars. They find a woman to mess with your head so you'll pour your heart out. It's not her, it all to do with Freud. According to psychoanalysis, hypnosis can get to your subconscious. From there, it can reach your darker side. After reaching that side, your traumas can be treated. There'll be symbolic memories. That's really deep. I can't help it. It was written in the book that Shen gave me. Are you friends with Shen? No way. He's the one clinging to me. Mr Shen. Mr Shen. Let me apologise for Yan. I'll apologise for him. Have you ever heard the saying, "Men are changed by events, not events by men?" There's no present without the past. Thank you. What? Good speech. Where's Sam? He sent the two of us. Sam. Are you reading? Any recommendations? And you? How To Get Rich in One Day. It's good. I don't need the money. I've helped you these last few years. You should speak first. You already know everything that I know. Let's cut the crap. Will you help me? You help me, I help you. We'll help each other. Good. What are you doing here? Me? I'm here... He's gone. Who is he? A pimp. Why were you tailing him? I'm a pimp too. I want to know if he stole my girls. Actually, I could do with some money. If you don't mind, how about hiring me? Be serious, Dr Lee. Be serious, pimp. Hello, Internal Affairs. Boss, I saw Yeung with Sam today. Yeung may be a mole. Run a check on him. Sam's deal with Shen should start soon. Hello? Uncle Chan, you're here so late. I'm changing the water. You're quite something, Uncle Chan. You know exactly when we run out of water. Don't just talk, give me a hand. Damon, help him. Let me, Uncle Chan. Let me. Hello? Why didn't you speak just then? Yan sent me a tape. Chan Wing Yan sent you a tape? Wait for me. Hey! What's the matter with you? I'm busy. - Wait. What is it? You've been back for two days. You haven't seen anybody else but me. Am I supposed to greet everyone? Hey! Did I scare you? Sorry. I don't know why you've locked yourself up for two days. Whatever it is, don't take everything on yourself. Everything will be OK after tomorrow. Lau. The door is over there. PO BOX 27149 CHAN WING YIN Let's give it to OCTB. Have you listened to it? No. Sam and Shen's transaction is in two days. There'll be lots of arms and coke. I'll contact you before it starts. So Sam doesn't completely trust you yet. Beware of Yeung. I will. Can you arrest him? You saw them together. That's not enough. How can I arrest him? Boss, I'm risking my life for you. Don't tell me that. I'll take care of Yeung. You? Don't worry. Lau's a great help. What are you saying? It's his fault that you die. It was an accident. Don't you want us dead? I just want to be a good man. Give me another chance? Sorry, I'm a cop. Are you OK? I'm OK. I'm OK. Do you know what you were doing? I know. So what? Can you take me back to my office? - Of course. Are you OK? Come on, let's go. Good morning. Your hypnotherapy is really good. I'm all relaxed. I've made some progress so I guess I won't need to go to prison. We need to work together in hypnotherapy. If you don't tell the truth... ..no one can help you. I'm already very cooperative. It's OK if you don't want to talk about the triads... ..but when we're chatting, you still lie about what films you like and what you like to eat. I don't understand. You're not me. You wouldn't understand. God didn't mean for our minds to keep secrets. I remember when I was a child... ..I stole some chocolate from a supermarket. A family-sized bar. A foot long. When I got to the till, the manager caught me. I was scared and I just cried. The manager let me go. Later, I went to the supermarket with my mum. I saw the manager again. I just felt him staring at me. I felt uneasy. My mum asked me what was wrong. I said the manager had molested me. My mum called the police. The police took the manager away. That manager never told on me. I never saw him again. When I went to university, I finally told this to a classmate. After I told the story, I felt like I had been reborn. Can I really start over again? Do you trust me? I do. It'll be OK if you trust me. When did you join the triads? I didn't want to be in the triads. I want to be a good man. But... ..I met Mary. Your wife? Sam's woman. Why am I saying this? You have to trust me so I can hypnotize you. Then we can solve your problems. You can't solve my problems. My job is to betray those close to me. I don't know when I can stop. I want to survive... ..so I have to betray those close to me. Actually, I'm a cop. I'm a cop. I don't want to be Sam's mole. Did I scare you? Sorry. Don't worry, everything will be OK after tomorrow. Where were you? The transaction's today. Today? - Yeah. I've been forgetful. Hand these out. Yan. You go in Shen's boat. Be careful. There are arms in there. If anything goes wrong... I know. You go with me to the dockyard. Shen and Sam's deal is happening tonight. They might be heavily armed. Wear bulletproof vests. The water police are standing by. Teams A and B, get ready on the hill. Call the operation off. What are you saying? It's an order from the top. An order from the top or from you? I don't need to explain. I've been on Sam's trail for years. What are your ties with him? This is Security's top secret. You can make a formal inquiry to the Assistant Commissioner. Call IA and check. - Yes, sir. Just do what Yeung says. I won't. Wong, this isn't as simple as you think. It's very simple for me, sir. My man is risking his life out there. Everybody in OCTB stays put. You're under disciplinary investigation. What disciplinary issues? You don't follow orders. That's a disciplinary issue. Where are you going? Back to my office, sir. You can go. Tang. - Yes. Turn back. - OK. Ask everyone to follow our car. Sam, Yan's doing the transaction. Hello? Your wife has agreed to meet you this afternoon. Is that OK? Thank you. Thank you. The Mainlanders will come in today for extradition. Make sure nothing goes wrong. Be careful. Damon and Fai, you stay here. - OK. Set the channel to 34879. OK? Tell Transportation we can go now. - OK. Thank you. Inspector Lau, are you having fun in my office? Everybody, get ready. Follow me. What's going on? We're having Yeung round for coffee. The Mainlanders are chatting inside. They'll meet our boss in 15 minutes. Don't make any mistakes. Damon and Fai, get the documents ready. Yeung Kam Wing. You're suspected of conspiring with Sam. Please come back with us to IA. Inspector Lau, do you know what you're doing? I know. I found a tape. What tape? I don't understand. Listen and you will. Where's Sam? Sam's not here yet? They're empty! Shen! The arms cost HK$10 million. Give them back. Those Mainlanders are animals. What if they're setting me up? - Who told you that? My life told me so. What if you're wrong? Then I'll cooperate with them. But Yan's going to die either way? We're all risking our lives in this business. I almost died twice. Sam, don't play games. Sam! I've only ever had one guy work for me! How can you do this to me? What are you saying? Tell me. Tell me. Where are my goods? Where have you put them? Go and ask Sam yourself. Why didn't you shoot me in the head? I didn't aim. Stand up. Stand up! Are you two in this together? You two are in this together. Sorry, I'm a cop. Go ahead and shoot. It'll save me a bullet. What? Are you sure you're a cop? I am. I got an "A" for writing reports. After I kill both of you, I can write what I like. He's not really Sam's man. Then you're not really Shen. You're just in time. Listen with us. It's interesting. So you don't want to help me, Inspector Lau? I do, but they're watching me. So you're not worried about me. You're worried about yourself. Whatever you say. You deal with him. Give me three days. I'll run a check and call you. Inspector Lau. Lau Kin Ming, this is your last chance. Don't waste it. Lau Kin Ming, you're under arrest. Lau Kin Ming's over there! What are you doing? What are you doing? We agreed to arrest him. Why are you helping him? Yeung found this tape in your room. What's the problem? - That cop was following me. I'm in charge now. Call me if you've got transactions. We got the goods when we killed the cop. Cuff him. What are you doing? Move back! Sit down! Sit down! Move back! Inspector Lau... - Move back! Move back! What are you doing? I told you to be careful. Why should I be careful? Why? I'm a good man. Why should I be careful? Why? I worked so hard. I helped you kill... ..all of Sam's moles. Why can't you give me a chance? Why can't you give me a chance? I only want to be a good man. Why can't you give me a chance? Why? Tell me! Sorry, I'm a cop. Sorry, I'm a cop. I'm a cop too! Are you sure you won't go to the hospital? People like me can't go out into the light. Same here. I'll get more credits if I bleed. Did I cause you trouble? It's just a report. Be careful when dealing with Sam. - You too. It was Sam who set you up. You won't bump into me next time. Will we see each other again? I'll pass. - Speak Mandarin. I'm going to Beijing next week. Come along. I'll quit after this. And you? I'm a mole, we don't have holidays. OK. See you. See you. You haven't told us yet. What's your name? Name? I don't know. Just call me Shadow. That's so corny! It's time for me to go. You haven't answered me yet. I asked you if you recognised me. At the cadet school in 1991, If you hadn't left, I wouldn't have got the Award. Lau's been taken to the hospital. He's still in critical condition. The bullet is in his brain. The doctors say that even if he recovers, his brain will be severely damaged. His room is full of information about the moles. The department was covered by hidden cameras that were connected to Yeung's computer. Hello? Mary? He won't be able to meet you. DECEMBER 2002 TEN DAYS AFTER YAN'S DEATH He's dead. What's the point? There are things we've got to do. Hey, you're right. Dr Lee, everything will be OK after today. I'll arrest Lau Kin Ming myself. ONE MONTH LATER I'm giving it back to you. He turned me into a cripple. Was he Yan's friend? They were in cadet school together. You have to follow the rules at cadet school. Those who break the rules will be like him. They'll be expelled. Who wants to trade places with him? Yeung, congratulations on getting the Award. Would he have got it if he hadn't been expelled? Perhaps that's fate. Destiny is destiny. Men are changed by events, not events by men. But these two men... ..they have changed certain events. OK... Let bygones be bygones. Tomorrow is another day. Bye. SEVEN MONTHS LATER You're here? The baby can say "daddy" now. He shot me so I shot him back, like a triad would. NOVEMBER 2002 A WEEK BEFORE YAN'S DEATH Stop having a go at me and learn from Yeung. Learn what? Learn how to write a report. If you've killed someone, it's a big deal. So it's OK if I got killed? Send me a report. I'll send you nothing. What did you say? You can go. - What? Lunchtime. - I've just had breakfast. Would you rather eat shit instead? Excuse me. What is it? I'd like to try this stereo.
