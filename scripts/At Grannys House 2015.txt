One of my young lovers of course. Five bam. But you have so many, it's like a revolving door. You know people are beginning to talk. Yes, we are quite notorious here. Well if only that were the case. Rebecca and I would be having much more fun here. Two flower. Still though, all those young men. Keeps you young, doesn't it? You'll never tell, I know. Oh, we don't want that from you. I never saw this coming. I guess I was confused. It's all about love, after all. For 50 years, never had a babysitter. It's a caretaker, mom. She's not here to babysit you. Listen ma, it's not even about the stairs. Do you remember what happened last time you mixed up a caretaker can help you keep 'em all straight. What was wrong with Carol, I liked her! We already talked about this. She wasn't qualified, and it really doesn't even matter if you liked her, we're not doing this for a rent-a-friend here. I guess my choice means nothing. No, that's not it, mom. I just meant... you know better than your senile mom, right? That's not it. I hire people all the time, it's what I do. I just know what I'm looking for, that's all. Come on ma. What time is your flight? Mom. Never mind. Thanks again for coming. The pleasure is all mine, it's great to meet both of you. I understand how this could be... Awkward for you. I'm here to help. Well I'm glad to hear that, thank you. You have a wide breadth of experiences. Yes, I guess I'm a collector. A collector? Collecting professions, as it were. Excuse me, a moment. Sorry about that, work. Where were we? Oh yes, a collector? Now that's an interesting way you put that. Let's see here, you've worked in health care, it, entertainment and... Excuse me, mortuary? Yes. I did that in college. It was interesting, but not really for me. So, what brings you to Haley? I've spent a lot of time in big cities, east coast, west coast... I wanna get out of the rat race. I just wanna go somewhere... Simple. Friendly. Quiet. Somewhere I can take care of someone and... Figure out my next step. Do you uh... Do you have any questions about the job? No, I think the job description was pretty clear. Similar to other jobs I've had. Not to interrupt, I just wanna say, that although the job is similar, being a caregiver is a huge responsibility, and it's different from place to place and person to person. I will do my best to fit into your life and to make it better. Well thanks, I'm sure that... have you ever been married? Mom! That, that has... no. It is a fair question. If I'm gonna move in, she has the right to know a little bit more about me than what's on my resume. I've never been married. I've been close a few times. I don't know. Maybe I'm not the relationship kind. Well I'm sure a pretty woman like yourself has had her chances. Thanks, I suppose so. Things just always seem to fall apart. I'm better single, I guess. Well, I can understand that. I don't know about her. What's not to like? She's got, she's got experience. A great background, good references. I don't know. She just seems too good. Are you kidding me? You don't want her here 'cause she's too right for the job? I don't believe this. You know, mom, it doesn't even matter. I offered her the job, she accepted. We signed an agreement, you do remember that right? It was your agreement, not mine. Dammit, I'm just trying to help. You can't live here alone. So you say! You're damn right! Look, you need help and now you've got it. Case closed. I gotta go. You always do. I will call you next week, okay? Everything will be great, I promise. This is some house you have here. How long have you lived here? 53 years. Wow. You don't see people set down roots like that much anymore. Why did you move to Haley in the first place? My husband was a doctor. You don't really want me here, right? It's nothing personal, I just... don't think you need help? Maybe you don't. And maybe your son pushed you into this? No, I didn't say that, i... I know. But I have eyes. Listen, I really am here to make your life better. Really. How about the nickel tour? Is that your husband? Yes, doctor passed away 12 years ago this month. I'm sorry. Part of life, death comes to us all. Next stop. This will be yours. Thank you, it's very nice. Did you stuff those yourself? Oh no, it was a family friend. Kind of ghastly, actually. I don't know. I rather like them. Pretty, well-preserved. Oh, you don't need to go down those stairs. No need to take unnecessary chances. I'm fine, it's no problem. Did you know that trips and falls are statistically the most common injuries among the elderly? I can take a quick look around myself. Really, I'm fine. And I insist. What's down there? Well, okay. There's a doctor's old office. Another bedroom. Now let's see uhm, a workshop. Storage, oh and the new basement. New? Oh, of course new is relative. We added it on the house years ago. I guess I'll make some tea. Would you like some? A lovely idea, please. I'll be right back. Perfect. Thanks. You're welcome. A very spacious basement you have. Hmm, haven't done a lot with it lately. Listen. I know you're not comfortable with me being here. Yet. But you will be. We'll make a great team. You'll see. Oh, you're up, sleepyhead! Going for the caffeine, eh? We're gonna have to switch to decaf, it's better for you. And I just about have breakfast ready, you'll love it. My famous oatmeal. Very heart-healthy. We wanna take good care of you, right? I prefer bacon. Hmm, nah-ah. So, how do you like it? It's good, thanks. And it's high in anti-oxidants, fiber and flavonoids, and low on cholesterol, and trans-fatty acids. Great. Have you heard from your son lately? No, he hardly ever calls. Now that you're here he doesn't have to even pretend he cares. Oh, that can't be right. He seemed like such a caring man. Hmm, caring for his checkbook maybe. I'm sorry you think that. He told me he loves you very much. He told you that? Hmm-mm. Yes, it was very sweet. You know, I'm thinking I'll move downstairs. Oh well, I think... perfect, I'll take my stuff down after breakfast. It'll be just like home. You in the upstairs. Me in the downstairs. Yeah... What are you looking for? Oh, I'm getting so forgetful nowadays. I could've sworn I had my Oprah magazine right here. Oh, it's not you, I took your magazine to read in bed. I'll go get it. Oh, thank you dear. Coming right up. You have some nice friends, fun. They're good folks, I've known 'em a long time. But new friends are good too. You know, I was thinking... What dear? Not really sure how to say this... Well, just say it, what could be so bad? Well, it's just you're so good with people and we have so much space here. Have you heard of myfreebed.Com? Oh, I don't use the web portal very much. Well, it's a great site, people sign up to meet new people, traveling through, to let them use their homes. Is that safe? Sure, people that about themselves on the site, and others who they have already stayed with vouch for them. I've used them both, both offering places to stay and staying with people. It's a really neat experience. And safe. Come to think of it, we did something like that during the war, only it was soldiers passing through. Of course we didn't have the web. We barely had running water. So what do you think? It's a great way to meet new people. Ah, I don't know. Don't worry, it will always be just one at a time. Come on, it'll be fun. The visitor will stay in the basement, so they'll be out of your hair and I'll take care of all of it. Come on, live a little. Maybe I should ask my son. Your son? This is your house. Okay. How does this work? Okay, so this is a listing of all the members. You have to be a member to request a bed. And we have to make a profile to offer a bed. Ready? Sure. Okay, so first we have to take a picture. Oh... Don't worry, you look great. You look great! All right, let's squish together. All right. Great, here it goes. Three, two, one! Oh, nice. Now what? Okay, I just need to finish the profile and we wait for someone who wants to stay here. In Haley? You'd be surprised. Done. In the city, and I had a hard night with some Singapore slings. And the waitress who served them. Good lord, what's wrong? I'm not feeling too much like business. It's just one knock on the office door. I just got my name on it. We have one on myfreebed. Someone who wants to visit. Really, oh? Look. Okay, look. His name is Bob rusk, let's see. 25 from des moines, on his way to California, wants to stay on the 14th. Wow, that's three days from now. What'cha think? It'll be fun. Yay, I'll let him know. So Bob, why are you going to California? Well, my uncle has got a fruit business out there, so I figured, I'd go out there, you know, help him out a little bit. Enjoy the awesome weather for a change, and who knows, maybe even try my hand at being an actor. Well that sounds wonderful. I remember when I went to California, it was lovely. Oh really? When was that? Oh, years ago, you probably weren't even born. You know, I can't thank you ladies enough for letting me stay here, I mean, it's making a huge difference in my very, very small budget. Well good. It's our pleasure. May I show you to your room? Sure. Excuse me ma'am. Off course. Like I was saying, the weather in the winter, back when I was young, was much colder. Loads, yes. I remember back in '64, now that was cold. It was so cold. Hmm-mm. That pigs were freezing in their slop. Oh, what a mess that was to clean up. Nothing, just in Haley doing this myfreebed thing. And I'm not sure about this whole global warming stuff, you know, back when I was a girl... As soon as I can, trust me. Can I get you something to drink? No, I'm just sitting around, you know, doing nothing, like the usual. Ssshht, ssshht. It doesn't take long, it doesn't take long. Strong one. I gotta go but I'll be right back. So much to do. So little time. Hey there. Not like you to stay in so late. Hmm, didn't sleep well. Our young friend is sleeping late too. No, he left early this morning. Said he had to catch the early bus. Oh, what a shame, nice young man. Any new requests? Nope. Everything at its time. Yes? I just wanted to tell you... It's been nice having you here. It just took some getting used to. That's understandable. Change can be difficult. Exactly, thanks for understanding. I wanted to talk to you about your eternal salvation. Excellent! Pick up my son from my mom and dad's house, and this really saves on hotels. And then you're out of here at dawn? I'm sorry. Uhm yeah, uh, tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning. That is so neat. I always thought being a vet would be fascinating. It is, I'm blessed to be where I'm at in my life. I know the feeling. So, how did you get started in this line of work? Well, it was actually when I was just a little girl. I was outside playing, when I heard the sound of brakes screeching in the street. When I got there, I found that someone had hit a dog and then just drove away and left it. Horrible! How could someone do such a thing? I have no idea. Anyway, I picked it up and carried it home. My mom and I took it to the vet, and then I took care of it. You nursed it back to life? What a wonderful story. I had a dog when I was a little girl. We should get a dog. A dog? Oh dear no, they require a lot of care. What do you think? Did you hear what I said? You went to the dogs there for a moment. Yes. They require a lot of care. And you seemed like such a nice lady. I really liked your dog story. Feel and breathe, that is the key. Now open your eyes. And how do you feel? Very good, I feel good. Say now, look behind you. Looks like we might have visitors. Wonderful. What else do you see? When did you say they would be here? 15 minutes ago. You're as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs. Oh, that must be them. What were their names again? Ted and Linda steiner. Come on in, have a seat. Thank you. Hmm-mmm. So, what brings you to Haley? Well, we're kinda in transition. So we decided to travel a bit. What he means is, I'm in-between jobs. And since he can work from anywhere, we have some flexibility. Oh, and what kind of job... what do you do? Are you some sort of consultant? Uh yeah, I guess you could call me that. I work in it. Managing company's networks. Boring tech stuff. No, not all. I worked in it before. Fascinating. To answer your question, I worked in a nonprofit, advocating literacy. Now that sounds like a rewarding job. Well rather, worked, I got downsized. Oh... So, here we are. Put our life in storage and left the big city. To Haley, and beyond I suppose. Meanwhile I'm still looking for a job, I'm sending out resumes, making phone calls. Amazing what you can do with the Internet now. Indeed. It's all about bringing people together. So we normally don't have couples stay with us. But your picture was so nice. Yes, I do have experience in that area. We thought, why not try? Yes, that'd be fantastic, thank you for calling. All right, that's exactly what I've been looking for. Why not? Great, yes, I would love to. Guess we need a lost and found. Bad habit? The worst. So if you need anything, I'm in the room down the hall. Will do. Excuse me. I guess I wasn't paying attention. I should've seen you coming. Distracted? I guess you could say that. And your wife? She finally fell asleep. Finished her phone calls? No... Not now. Your wife is a problem. Tomorrow? Wow, this is tasty, what do you call this again? Scrapple, an old family recipe. What'cha think hon, good stuff huh? Yeah. She's not much of a morning person. Neither am I, I made this last night. So, what are your plans? Well, I've been thinking about that. I think we should stay another day. What, why would we stay here? I mean it's nice here and all, but, we have plans, right? Well as always you're right, but you do have a lot of e-mails to catch up on. And the signal is good here. So, spend the day, relax. Take care of business. Okay, one night, that's it. Okay, that should be all we need. Well, that's it for me. Time for my long winter's nap. Nighty night, folks. Oh thank god. I thought that show would never end. All about murder and CSI. I'm probably gonna have nightmares. Oh honey. I can fix that. Fix what? Your nightmares. I have a surprise for you. What? Meet me downstairs, 15 minutes. Oh, there you are. It's about time. Movie night. You're kidding right? Someone else's home movies? This is your big surprise? Come on, it will be great, we'll watch perfect strangers, you love that. Strange maybe, perfect, doubtful. There you go, have a seat. Okay, but if I fall asleep, don't let me drool. Perish the thought. We were in love, it was beautiful. So, how are you settling in downstairs? Quite well, thanks. I'm in the guest room, but if we have any free bedders, I just move the air mattress into the living room. Hmm. And I wanna thank you again for having me here. I think it's gonna be a good place for me. Too bad about your wife. Yeah, that was tough. But we've been growing apart for years. I should've seen it coming. Hmm, so many people split up nowadays, I just don't understand it. What have you heard from her? Let's see, where do you want her to be? Last I saw on Facebook she was in L.A. Does she know anyone there? No. She's never been there. East coaster all her life. That's a good place for her. Fresh start. Good cell service. What's next? We post some stock pictures from L.A., Hollywood, whatever, every once in a while. Post some generic status messages. "Looking for a new place!" "Oh, great restaurant!" That kinda stuff. How long do we have to do that? Not too long. People don't pay that much attention. She worked in nonprofits right? Yeah. Oh, perfect. She'll get a do-gooder job overseas. Will fall off the grid, won't have time for friends. That happens all the time. And that's that! You are a genius. You inspire me. Granny didn't say a word. I made Rebecca happy, and that was enough for her. At first. Is Becca here? Shopping. Uhm, I usually watch the news right now. Really? I like Seinfeld. Guess we'll just have to take turns. Am I in your chair? Oh, sorry about that. I'll be done in a jiffy. Ri, r-i? Yep, look it up. What the hell does that mean? Are you challenging? Never mind. Ah, my turn. S-l-i-t. Slit, I guess we know that means huh? Any new bed requests? Not yet. Hmm, too bad. Indeed. Always nice to meet new people. Ah, got one. I got one! Oh... Yes. Nicely done, love. Hello? Hello ma'am, is this Marion Rogers? Yes, it sure is. What can I do for you? Ma'am my name is boarstag, I'm investigating the whereabouts of Linda steiner. Hello ma'am? Oh, I'm sorry, I was just thinking of your name. How do you spell that? B-o-a-r-s-t-a-g. It's Lithuanian. Why isn't that interesting, I've never heard a name like that before, it's... yes ma'am, it's unusual. Now about miss steiner. Oh, I'm so sorry, I drifted there a bit. Happens when you're my age, you know. Yes ma'am, I understand she and her husband visited you. Yes, they did. Quite some time ago now. Late may perhaps? That sounds about right. And you say this woman is missing? Yes ma'am. Since shortly after her visit with you. Well, I'm very sorry to hear that. I sure hope you find her. Thank you ma'am. Ma'am would you mind if come by and talk to you about this? Stop by, my house? Yes, ma'am, I could be there in an hour if that suits. An hour? I'll be there in an hour. He's looking for Linda. Ladies, I'm lavrans boarstag. Thank you ma'am. That was very tasty. Oh, you can call me Marion. So, the steiners found you on uh, now what did you call that site again? Myfreebed.Com. That's an interesting idea. Do you get many visitors from that site to you? Oh, not that many. We're kind of out of the way. Hmm... So the steiners found you through this site, and then what happened? Well, they arrived a bit late one night. We had a nice chat, and they left pretty early the next day. Sweet couple. They said they were headed west. L.A. I think. Interesting. Why is that? Well that doesn't jive with what they told their friends. Really? Really. Told them they were heading out to Texas. Miss steiner had a job interview out there. Maybe a change of plans. They did seem kind of flighty, if you know what I mean. Perhaps. So you haven't seen either of the steiners since they left your place? After one night? No. I see. Hey ma'am is that your garage out back? I asked miss Rogers. Yes. That buick park Avenue, Virginia vanity plate "de menos", is that your car? You know it's not. It belongs to the steiners. My gosh. They leave here walking? Of course not, they took the bus. They left the car behind? Do you find that unusual? They were an unusual couple. So you say. Well. I'll be needing to look at the car. Oh, one more thing. Mr. steiner. What about him? He does it consulting, so he's on his computer a lot. So? His e-mail address and his ip headers come back to this area. Yesterday. Ladies. Ted steiner's still here. Of course not, we told you they left. Yes ma'am, I know. Well, mind if I have a look around? I don't think that's gonna be ne... I can do it now, or I can come back with the police. But that's your choice. Of course, we have nothing to hide. Your room upstairs? No. More private down there I suppose. Of course, be my guest. I'll stay up here if you don't mind. Your room? May I? Everybody needs a hobby. Mr. steiner I presume? Owh! You needed a knife. Bastard kicked me. Let me guess. You showed him old home movies? That's when everything changed. Is that enough? I don't know, I hope so. It depends on who he might have told. Did you check his phone? You know I did, you saw me. I saw you look at it, did you check it? Do you wanna do it next time? No, I'm just saying we have to be thorough. Oh, yes, thorough. Who forgot to take care of their car? Or mask their ip address? Who was that? You're right. I'm sorry. What about her? What about her? She knows. No shit she knows, so what? She can turn us in. If she told, she'd fry too. They actually use the death penalty in this state, remember? We just need to lay low and stay off myfreebed. It will all blow over if we play it cool. You okay with that? Good. You've reached the Rogers residence, we can't take your call right now, but please leave your name and number at the tone and we will get back to you as soon as we can, thanks. If you're like me, you hate telemarketers, but hang on, because what I have to say... He's right, I hate telemarketers. It's a fine day. Let's take a walk. Shall we? This town is lovely in the summertime. We should do this more often, it really... you need to do something about Ted. What do you mean? He's not handling this well. He's a man, he's weak. Women are always stronger, right? I'm not sure if I know what you mean. He puts us at risk. I... I don't think I can do that. Of course you can dear. Beautiful, don't you just love red roses in bloom. Nice walk? Lovely. Would you be a dear and get me some lemonade? Hot outside. With ice. My pleasure. Did you have a nice day? Fine. Kinda strange, her wanting to take a walk, huh? What did you two talk about? Flowers. The weather. Current events. I'm gonna go to sleep. What are you doing down here? This is my house. What are you doing here? I wan... we're just cleaning up a bit. Long overdue, really. That's mine. Oh, you better take it then. Ted, we're having lunch outside. I'll be right out. All right, let's eat. What's going on? We de... let me, dear. Have a seat. We think it's best that you leave. What? We? Do you agree with this? She's upset enough, don't make it worse. She's upset? Things change, we have to adjust. Adjust, by me leaving? I don't think so. It's best if you leave as soon as possible. You don't understand. I'm not going anywhere. I thought you might say that. Look at it this way. If you don't go, we'll pin it all on you. After all it's your wife and your car. You had motive, and ability. I'm just a little old lady. Who do you think they'll believe? I'm sorry. I love you. I love you. I'm not going anywhere. I know a thing or two, too. We'll all fry together. Morning. Hey, I'm thinking about going into town later. Does anybody need anything? Nothing for me. Marion! Call 911. Call 911! I don't know what happened. I thought we solved this problem before. Oh Sam. Don't you "oh Sam" me. You gotta be careful with these pills you're taking. They get mixed, big time bad news. I've you known you since were a little girl, don't you worry about me. And don't even think about taking me to the hospital. I'm not going anywhere. I still think you should've gone to the hospital. For observation, like Sam said. I can observe myself just fine. And I have you to help me, right? Of course. He did this. No, I don't believe it. It's easy to confuse your pills, you put your... no, no, it was him. I remember thinking that my pillbox was moved, but I took the pills anyway. That's crazy. Killing your wife for a woman you just met, is crazy. Him trying to kill me makes sense. Ted and I are in love. Seriously, your pillbox was moved? You're jumping at shadows. You'll have to kill him. It's the only way out. Now that is getting up. Hey, looks like you're feeling better. In that case it is a fine morning. So, who's hungry? I know I am. Me too, I could eat a horse. Must be all the exercise. Okay, I'm on it. Bacon and eggs, all around. You're not hungry? Are you feeling okay? I feel fine. Are you gonna eat that? Yes, I am. Just checking. Going to bed? Everything is gonna be fine. You'll see. I wish I could be so sure. Everything will be better in the morning. Sleep well. You too. Hey boy. You thirsty? Not yet, but I will be. This is all for the best, my love. Calmly, please. It will all be over soon. Lay back, sweetheart.
