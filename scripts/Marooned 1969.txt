Here in the control center, our status board still indicating all is well. Network, Flight. You configured for the terminal count? - Roger, Flight. We're a go. - Okay. Check status for terminal count, Rooster? - Go, Flight. - Retro? - We're a go. - Fido? - Go. - GMC? - Go, Flight. - E- CO M? - Affirmative, Flight. - F- CO M? Go all the way. Sony Panel Three, tape recorder forward, switch to forward. - Verify gray bar. - Roger, we have a gray flag. DNC is running, Flight. Roger, in automatic sequence, start on my mark. - Mark. - All right, Jim. - Stand by your panel 325 function. - Roger. - Fuel pre-pressure initiated. - Roger, Fuel. - This one's gonna light on your toes. - PCS bypass on. - Glycol radiator full to bypass. - Full to bypass. - Internal cooling, Flight. - This is launch control. The second stage fuel tank is pressurized. The third stage liquid oxygen tank pressurizing at this time. Ironman One, this is Flight, how do you read? - Loud and clear, Dick. - All right. CMP on panel two, verify program two. - We're a go, Flight. - Roger. - Flight recorder to record. - GDC, align. - GDC, align. - All recorders to flight speed. - Network, Flight. All okay with you? - Affirmed, Flight. RTC, you got everybody configured for commands? - That's affirmative. - Internal power and go, Flight. - You got the transfer? - That's affirmed. Ironman One, stand by for the 10-second count. Roger, Ted. Ten, nine, eight... ... seven, six, five, four... - Flight, safety is green downrange. - Roger, safety green. - Booster okay. - Go, Flight. - Everything okay? - Affirmed. - GNC? - Go, Flight. - E- CO M? - Flight, we're a go. Roger. D X manual. - Stand by for mode one Charlie. - Mode one Charlie. Mode one Charlie. Rooster, I need your status for staging. - The tower has jettisoned. - Trajectory and guidance are a go. Roger, trajectory and guidance a go. - Spacecraft systems are a go. - Spacecraft systems are go. - All spacecraft systems are go. - No mistaking. - We have CECO. - Roger, CECO. Hey, it looks like a fine day down there! I can see all the way from Gibraltar to Greece. Coming up on the terminator, should be in our first sunset in a few minutes. - Loss of signal with Canary. - Roger, LOS. Okay time to activate TV transmission. We remote to Houston through Araya, Buzz. Araya One, this is Ironman, how do you copy, over? Ironman One, Araya. I read you loud and clear, copy. I read you the same. On my mark, TV transmission from camera A. - Mark. - Smile! - How are you getting this? - A little snowy, Ironman. Clearing up now. Clear now. Good picture. Well, say something, Ted. Are we beautiful? Ironman, this is Houston. See you real good, all three of you. - How about the other camera, Jim? - Camera B coming on. Mark. You should be getting me now. Here's Buzz. Here's Stoney. - How's it look? - Sharp and clear. How are you for docking with the lab? Docking is still planned for the second orbit as advertised. Roger. We have an update on your initial phase maneuver. Delta V, 249 at.3 feet per second. This is mission control, Houston... ...at 22 minutes into the flight of Ironman One. After a brief 20-minute flight across the Atlantic... ...the spacecraft is now crossing the Mediterranean. We begin to look at the business of the flight plan... ...which shows a rendezvous on docking... ...with the Saturn 4B orbital laboratory. Buzz, what's our closing rate? - Closing rate: 50 feet per second. - Roger. - Let me know when we have 25. - Roger. This is mission control, Houston. Commander Pruett reported completion of docking the Apollo... ...at the S- 4B laboratory. After completing systems checks, the crew will transfer into the lab... ... in which they will live and work for the next seven months. This will be a test of the spacecraft, the systems and most of all the men. In preparation for interplanetary deep-space missions... ... which are now being planned. During this entire period the astronauts will cover their activities... ... with TV cameras, which will be tape-recorded here on Earth... ... for study and evaluation. Well, it's not too bad. We could use a couple of windows though. I think we're missing the view. What's first, Buzz? Extra vehicular activities in the S-509 maneuvering unit. You take it out. Stoney, you handle the camera. Watch it, Stoney. Try a little aerobatics here. Here goes. Buzz, how about some work? Yeah, right. I'm coming right down. Okay, Buzz, micrometeorite experiment. - Say again, Stoney. - Micrometeorite. Roger, micrometeorite. This material was obtained during their first week in space. I am presenting it as a point of reference. Here is Pruett. Lloyd. Stone. We got this day before yesterday. It demonstrates a serious decline in the ability to perform... ...even simple manual tasks. Just over five months of the mission have been completed satisfactorily. We wonder if it remains desirable to continue for the full seven months... ...originally planned. - What are your parameters, Courtney? - EKG, rate and rhythm. - EEG, brain. - He's not sleeping. The trend shows definite fatigue. - Is he still losing weight? - Down 16 pounds. The quality of the solar spectral film's been very poor. - Well, you're not gonna see any more. - Why not? Take a look at this. Tired and he's making mistakes. You want to try living in a tin can for five months? - What else? - We got this yesterday. Some further degradations to our CS system: We've lost a backup coolant loop in the oil thruster. Oh, yeah. The washing machine is out. I was doing some preventative maintenance on it. I shorted it out. I also discovered some computation errors in the telescope settings. I guess that accounts for the poor quality in the solar spectral pictures. I... I've fixed the razor. So we can go back to shaving again now. And I'm sleeping better. I guess we're all getting our second wind. And if the hardware holds up, I guess we can make it right to the end. I know I can. I think they've done a hell of a job. Bring them down. Yes, sir. Mrs. Wheeler, get everyone on the net in mission control. This is mission control, Houston. The crew of Ironman One has closed down the S- 4B space laboratory... ...in which they've worked, lived, slept and eaten for the last five months. Their Apollo spacecraft has separated from the lab... ...and at this time, the automatic sequence of retrofire is about to begin. Ten, nine, eight... ...seven, six, five, four... ...three, two, one, retrofire. The spacecraft should be starting its descent across Australia... ...towards the splash point in the Pacific... ...some 400 miles south of Midway Island. They are waiting now for confirmation of retrofire. Standing by for contact. Ironman One, Ironman One, this is Houston CapCom, do you read? Ironman One, Ironman One, this is Houston CapCom, do you read? After five months in orbit, a mission termed... ...a successful prelude to the long-term space voyages... ...that some day will be normal and routine... ...astronauts Jim Pruett, Buzz Lloyd and Clayton Stone... ...should be on their fiery way home to the good Earth. Ironman One, Ironman One, this is Houston CapCom, do you read? Ironman One, Ironman One, this is Houston CapCom, do you read? Ironman One, Ironman One, this is Houston CapCom on UHF. Do you read? Ironman One, Ironman One, this is Houston CapCom on UHF. Do you read? Ironman One, Ironman One, this is Houston CapCom on S-band. - Do you read? - Go ahead, Houston. Hey, you old bum. How's the run? We have negative retrofire. Say again, Ironman. Negative, no burn. Bailey, kill it. - Ironman, wait one. - What's wrong, Dick? Don't know. E-COM, GNC, how does the data look? A minute and 20 seconds past retrofire. Ironman, Flight. Would you check your circuit breakers... ... and also your Delta V thrust manual A and B switches? Roger. Glenn, would you punch up channel six? - All parameters are normal. - Then why in the hell doesn't it fire? - Houston, Ironman. - Go, Ironman. Circuit breakers are closed, SPS switch is on. Delta V manual A and B switches are on. Thank you. We're affirming new target. Suggest you try manual re-entry on your next pass. Roger, understand manual re-entry using RCS backup system. Negative, Jim. Negative. We suggest you use the primary system. - We just told them it didn't work. - Houston... ...we prefer using the backup thrusters. I'm afraid you don't have backup thrusters. - Say again? - You've fallen too low in RCS fuel. What about the lab? There's oxygen in the lab. Houston, do we have enough fuel to re-dock with the lab? Negative, Ironman. Negative. - Well, what do you propose, Ted? - You have insufficient RCS fuel. You're going to have to try retrofire with your primary engine. Smart boys think your automatic control system is out... ...but you'll be able to get ignition... ...from your primary engine on manual command. In other words, kick the box, Jimmy. - Do you copy, Ironman ? - Yeah, copy. - Mr. Keith, BAO. - No announcement. We should say something, sir. We've been off the air... All right. Just keep it trivial. Keep it routine. - We may not have a problem. - Yes, sir. This is mission control, Houston. We received word from Ironman One of a malfunctioning switch... ...that has prevented retrofire on their last orbit. They'll bypass the switch. At their next orbit we'll try manual retrofire. This is Canon in Houston. - Yeah, Canon? - Unfreeze the dead, will you? - Hold on a second. - Are you ready now? - Go ahead. - Primary engine... ...did not fire on first pass. The secondary thrusters are out. Repeat, out. If that big baby doesn't fire this time, they're not coming back. Motor, pitch two and yaw two start, on. Pitch two and yaw two start, on. - One minute to burn. - One minute to burn. Translation hand controller, neutral. - Hand controller neutral. - Hand controller power, both. - On. - Direct RCS, on. - Direct RCS. - Delta V thrust, A and B normal. - A and B normal. - Thirty seconds to burn. - Thirty seconds. - Hand controller's armed. - Hand controller armed. - Hand controller's armed. EMS Delta V, auto. - Delta V, auto. - Fifteen seconds to burn. - Roger, 15 seconds. - Acknowledge. All right, you bastard, fire, fire, fire! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... ... five, four, three, two, one, retrofire. Direct Delta V switch. Ironman, this is Houston. Ironman, this is Houston, do you read? - Go, Houston. - Do you affirm retrofire? - Negative. - Say again. I said, we had negative retrofire. Ironman, this is Keith, do you get any indications from your event lights? Boss, we got a little light here that says we have retrofired. It's green. We're gonna decorate it for Christmas. All right, Ironman, we're going to work on it. Roger. Cabin pressurization on. We'll be back in a couple of hours. Get out of your hot suits. - Roger. - See you later. We'll be here. I want a complete tape dump from all sites. I want it played back here. And I want it in strip charts. Call Sacco, tell him to put an engine in the simulator. Feed it all the TM we've got and see what keeps it from firing. Hard copies of everything and an oxygen projection. Yes, sir. Mr. Keith? - Forgot all about them. - Ted, will you get them out of here? - Ben, take this. - Right. No retrofire. They're still up there. It'll take a little time to psych out the engine. Well, I guess it's time to go home and light the fires and mind the kids. Do you need a lift? - Did you talk to them? - Yeah. They're fine. For how long? - Well, we'll be in touch, Mrs. Stone. - Thank you, but... I'd also like to know what's happening. Teresa, Celia and I have been in this business 10 years. We learned the best thing is for us girls to keep our feelings to ourselves. And let the men get on with their jobs. - Right, Celia? - Wrong, Betty. It's been 15 years. Morning, ladies and gentlemen. Sorry that I've kept you waiting. - Dr. Keith, are you...? - Mr. Keith. - Are you on your way to Washington? - No. - Spoken to the White House yet? - No. Tell me, sir, who's responsible for withholding the news? - Oh, I'm the responsible officer. - Do you have a statement, Mr. Keith? No, but I would like to say that approximately 15,000 people... ...are trying to isolate and correct this malfunction. Every resource of the NASA and our industrial contractors... ...is being used to the fullest. - Mr. Canon. - Let me get this straight: - The spacecraft is still in orbit, right? - Yes. Going around the world every 94 minutes, right? That's right, Mr. Canon. How much oxygen does the crew have for life support? They're in no immediate danger. - There's a rumor the men are dead. - Not true. Mr. Henry? What happens if you can't get the engine to retrofire? We're prepared for every contingency, Mr. Henry. What happens if you can't get the engine to fire? Does the spacecraft continue circling around the Earth... ...until orbital decay slows it down sufficiently... ...for it to re-enter the atmosphere? If so, does the spacecraft and everything in it get burnt to a crisp... ...is that right? - Well, what's your point? How long before that happens, five years? Seven years. Have you given up hope, Mr. Keith? Certainly not, Mr. Canon. Why should I? If you'll excuse me now, please. Strawberry cereal cubes. Soup, corn, cream. Jim, why are we just lying here waiting, huh? For Ground to analyze the entire telemetry. So some smart-ass engineer can tell us we're out of luck? Why not go EVA? We'll check the engine ourselves. Maybe one of the fuel valves is frozen. No, Ground could tell that. Maybe we took a meteor strike. Maybe something hung up on separation. Just relax. Eat your chicken while it's hot. What are you looking at, Stoney? A disturbance in the inner-tropical conversion zone. Somebody's gonna have a hurricane. - Where's the center, Stoney? - It's just northeast of Cuba. Yeah, nice thick clouds, good east-west slope. Looks like clouding circulation's just beginning. She's gonna be a big beast. Alma, first of the season. Houston, this is Simulator. We have on the stand SPS engine unit H37 modified block four. This unit is an exact one-to-one duplicate... ... of the primary equipment in Ironman One. We have analyzed the engine telemetry. And we're attempting to construct a configuration... ... which will reproduce the conditions that prevented ignition. Three, two, one. Firing the engine. I say, apparently we have failed to prevent ignition. But we'll keep working on it. All right, the president's waiting for our recommendations. All right, the president's waiting for our recommendations. One, a statement to be issued at the conclusion of this meeting: "Every effort is being made to discover... ...and correct the spacecraft malfunction... ...in accordance with contingency plans... ...designed to meet such emergencies." Two, a report to be issued Tuesday morning... ...by the director of manned space flight. Emphasizing the high degree of safety and success in the program thus far. The accident will be compared to the failure of an experimental aircraft. It'll be noted that in the development of such aircraft... ...a 10 percent pilot loss is considered acceptable. Now, Wednesday morning, if necessary... ...the president will issue an appropriate message to the nation. Emphasizing the courage and determination of the crew. And their final wish, that the program be continued without pause. Discussion? Yeah, I have something. I want to talk about a rescue mission. I'm speaking for the pilots and some of the Air Force boys. We propose launching a rescue craft using one of their boosters. Rendezvous with Ironman, transfer crew and return to Earth. Dougherty, you haven't been listening. Courtney, will you repeat that trend data... ...on oxygen consumption in the spacecraft? As of now, they're going to live another 42 hours. Plus or minus two percent. Now, that takes us up to 10:30 Monday night. There's a launch window for a shot at 8:48 Monday night. Nothing to put in that window. An Air Force Titan 3C left Denver for the Cape one hour ago. Oh, actually it was already in the pipe. And also the XRV lifting body from Edwards. Can you get the Titan and an XRV... ...on the pad ready to go in 42 hours? - Some of our boys think they could. A non-man-rated booster and a craft that's never flown. Oh, it'll fly all right, and Dougherty here has all the qualifications. Proposal is rejected. Anything else? Yeah, what do I tell the pilots? Tell them that the request is outside the area of their competence. - We've got three men dying. - They're professionals. If they were here they'd say, "Take what you've learned. Get on with the next mission." I don't give a damn about the next mission! There's no room in this program for a chief astronaut... ...who cannot look at the whole picture. Then you fire me. You want to launch a rescue mission in 42 hours... All right. One: Assemble and check out booster stage one, stage two and trans stage. How long, on past performance? Well, on past performance, 12 days, but if we were... Twelve days. Two: Build up and strap on solid fuel stacks. - Four days, but we can... - Four days. Check launch weather for Monday night. There's a hurricane out there. and headed out to sea. Well, you're in luck. Three: Make the vehicle to the bird... ...and check out configuration. How long, colonel? - Bob? - We haven't any accurate way... ...to determine the minimum time... - Couldn't do it under five days. Four: Compute navigation and guidance tapes... ...for first apogee rendezvous, ...three weeks. - We'll go without a computer. - We'll go without a checkup. - And crew training in a craft... ...which has not been man-rated, which cannot be flown by one pilot... ...and which has not been modified to hold four men. How about that one? They'll do it in 42 hours. While you're assembling your rescue ship in 42 hours... ...and spending... How much would that cost, Fisher? - Fifty million. - So what? Plus how many deaths? - Jimmy? - In a program of this magnitude... ...in which all nominal safety factors are disregarded... ...I calculate.02 percent of the workforce... How the hell do you know how many people will die? Think we haven't considered rescue? Here it is. Rescue and every other contingency. Reduced to digitals and computerized. You helped to write it. - A rational approach. - Well, screw your rational approach. Three of your pilots are in trouble. And if you don't try to get them down, well, God damn you! Well, you have feelings. Good. I have feelings. That's why we live by the rules. Wheeler. Courtney. Fisher. Klein. Degrote. Those men up there are your friends. Can you launch a rescue mission in 42 hours? - Yeah, all right. - Are you ready to talk to him now? - We're ready at this end. - The president will take your call... - ... at 7:00 our time. - Very good. The president will take the call at 7:00 his time. That leaves us an hour and 15 minutes. - Your license, please... - Officer, I'm a government official. - I'm in a hurry. - I can see that. Here's security, Q clearance, top secret. You've got a lot on your mind, all right. That's how it happens. - You forget where you are and wham. - I've got to get to a telephone. Shut off your engine. I'm Charles Keith, head of Manned Space. I know who you are. BS G-2896553, another code three, Charles Raymond Keith. You have no brake lights. Your license is expired. You may get to the moon, but you're a menace on the road. - Are you Charles Raymond Keith? - Yes! Somebody named Olympus wants to talk to you. Can you patch me into command network, Baker to Olympus? Keith, where are you? Mr. President, I have a sort of a problem here. What do you have for me? Well, we're analyzing the engine telemetry. We've got a contractor running a similar engine... ...in a failure mode, and we're running down the history... ...of all the hardware in the spacecraft. What else can you do besides what you're doing? I don't think there's anything else. Have you fellas considered rescue? Yes, we've discussed it, of course. What do you think? Well, sir, it's a very, very remote possibility. Charles, can I talk to you as a friend? Well, yes, sir, of course. You're right, and for the right reasons. But if we do it your way, 200 million people are going to start raising hell. Well, Mr. President, it's not my way. There is data... ...and there are certain facts that we have to deal with. Charles, just put away your slide rule for a minute and listen. There's more going on here than logic. The world is watching us and what we do... ... about rescuing these men. To say that there's nothing we can do... ... is going to be disaster for me, for you and for your program. We have to take a crack at it with the very best we've got. Now, what do you say, Charles? Mr. President, it'll be a dangerous gamble, but we'll go if you say so. You let me know how you're doing and what you need. Whatever you want, you've got it. - confirmed tonight that the SPS engine failed to fire... ... leaving America's three astronauts in orbit... ... some 285 miles above the Earth, circling the globe every 94 minutes. They are now approaching the west coast of Africa. No word has been issued as to the cause of the malfunction... ... beyond the statement made by Dr. Keith at the news conference... ... held this morning in... - that contingency plans have been developed... ... to meet every conceivable emergency. It has been reported from mission control in Houston... ... that the three astronauts are... Okay, Buzz, you're right. To hell with waiting for a bunch of slide-rule jockeys. We used to fix the airplanes we flew with paper clips. Let's get into our hard suits and fix this bird. - Okay, Jimmy. - You watch the store, will you, Stoney? Yeah, go. - Ironman One this is Houston Flight. - Go, Houston. We're coming up to get you, Ironman. Say again. We're coming to get you. We're launching a rescue mission from the Cape. We're using a Titan 3C with an XRV lifting body modified to hold four men. The pilot is Ted Dougherty. Do you read, Ironman ? Yeah, yeah, we read you. Houston, when do you estimate launch? Just over 40 hours, Stoney. Forty hours? Who are they kidding? Do you read, Ironman? We've decided to make a move up here. Go EVA and eyeball the engines. The fuel valves could be frozen. We'll pull the insulating hatches. If they are... ... we'll get in the sun and get some heat on them. That's an interesting thought, but we have no indication... ... of that here or anything else you could correct. We're all agreed the rescue mission is it. We're agreed we have to take affirmative action to repair our vehicle. Ironman, stand by one. Tell them negative, Jimmy, negative. Jim, we appreciate your desire to take affirmative action... ... and we need your affirmative action if the mission is to succeed. The most critical factor is your oxygen supply. To get 15 minutes of activity outside the spacecraft... ... to eyeball the engine, you have to trade off... ... three or four hours of passive breathing. From where we sit you don't have that oxygen to spare. Therefore, we'd like to suggest that you go into low-tide mode... ... lower your oxygen pressure to 3.5... ... execute a full emergency power down... ...and take your pills. They want us to buy it while we're sleeping. Do you copy, Ironman? Yeah. We're thinking about it. Tell them negative, Jim, negative. Pruett, now, this is Keith. I'm down here at the Cape with Sadler... ...and we're getting this rescue shot ready to go. Don't do anything foolish. Don't climb into your hard suits. Don't get out your tools... ...and don't try to fix the engine. Just take your pills and go to sleep. Can you get us down, boss? We've got a better chance than you do. - We'll be back at you. - Roger. Yeah, he's lying. Buzz, you eat up 25 percent more oxygen every time you lose your cool. Houston, Ironman, preparing for power down. Roger, Ironman. What are the numbers, Stoney? Well, with nominal oxygen usage, I make it 36 hours left. Take out the pad, 40 hours, more or less. How you figuring the residual amounts in the tanks? How would you? Yeah, you'd have to breathe them dry to find out. No one's ever done that. Yeah, well, I got the feeling we just may be the first. Royce Fitzgerald, call 10-993. Resume count-off, my mark at minus 240. Mark. Pull the GNN circuit breakers and the IMU heater breakers. Circuit breakers off. Shut down the attitude control system. SCS secured. Shut down number two and three fuel cells. We'll leave one on the line in case we have to charge. Two and three off. What about the comm? No, we'll leave it on. Flood lights off. EL off. Buzz, are the lower equipment bays dark? The B lights are off. Then why isn't that off? I don't know why. Houston, Ironman. - We're cranked down. - Copy, Jim. We'll check in when you come over the hill at Guaymas. We're gonna keep you informed every step of the way. Get some sleep now. - In a while. - Jim, this is Courtney. I want you to take one tablet of Stryzene after every meal... ... and one when you complete power down. You can drink as much water as you want. Every word, every emotion costs oxygen... ... so the more relaxed you are, the better. All right, you bums, take your pills and go to sleep. Hey! Hello, big brother. - Hey, Ted. - Hi, Stoney. Hey, where are you? What's all the racket? Well, I'm in Huntsville, kluging up a simulator to the XRV. Say again? A simulator to the XRV. I'm gonna do a little pressure up here before I take it to the Cape. This is a great time to start learning how to fly it. All you guys gotta worry about is where you want me to set you down... ...after I make the transfer. Go on, pick your spot. Edwards, Vegas, how about the beach in Malibu? Why not? All right, take your pills, go to sleep and leave the driving to us. I'll see you in 39 hours and 16 minutes. Simulation will begin in 10 minutes. Maintain RF silence until further notice. How does it look to you? The XRV will leave in two hours, be on the pad in five. That gives you nine hours. You're not gonna make it. We've got eight separate systems to verify. - I don't know how to do it any faster... - Here. That's how you're gonna do it. Colonel, you've got automatic backups designed into all your systems. Now you're gonna find out if they work. Range 6-5, range 2-4. A little under. Three-point-four second vert. Range 6-3, range 2- 1. Missed his target by 20 miles. Col. Dougherty, you've overshot. Yeah, I know. I missed it by 20 miles. Is it possible to break down the program into segments... ... to repeat DPI to rendezvous? No, we don't have the time to break up the tapes. Okay. Can we recycle fast time from launch to first Delta V... ... and real time from then? Okay, will do. All right, let's go again. The tape is ready. On my mark, first Delta V burn. Three, two, one, ignition. Roger, I have ignition. Timer on and counting. We have a new APT, and it's not good. - It's turned. - Sure has. How soon will it get here? What do you think? Eight hours, major. Seven, maybe eight. It's gonna be a tight fit. All right. Keith speaking. Yes, okay. Okay. - Hello, Mr. President? - The hurricane. Well, it changed course. Eighty-mile winds heading straight for us. Well, we can launch in winds up to 45 miles per hour. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure, sir. I wrote it. No, they can't help us. I've already talked to them. I know Kashvin pretty well. You see, their Voshkod's in the wrong orbit, won't wash. We can't launch any earlier, sir. We have to go precisely at 8:48. Well, what are you gonna do? We just keep going. Keep plugging. Deep, dreamless sleep. That's a nice adjustment. Nightmare? He's an angry, active guy. Frustrated. He's helpless. - Can we give him something to do? - No. He's not taking his pills. He's got a lot to think about. The sleep period should be terminated. All right, but tell mission control not to keep him busy. - Kid him along, keep him informed. - Yes, sir. Houston CapCom, this is Courtney. This is Houston, CapCom, Frank Piro. Frank, wake them up. And, Frank, Mr. Keith does not want you to try to keep them busy. Just keep them informed, kid them along. Understood. The sleep period is terminated. Hi, fellas! We see you're awake now. Thought we'd bring you up to date on mission status. The solid stacks are being strapped on... ...and we'll be moving the bird on the pad in about nine hours. Say, here's a little item of space news. The Russians have just launched another Voshkod. Would you believe it's carrying a Red Army all-girl marching band? Say, you guys still asleep? No, we're having a wild party. Hey, that's pretty funny. You sure you're taking your quiet pills? We are, but the girls aren't. Well, have fun. Roger, Houston. You never wind down, do you, Stoney? No, never do. I just do the job I was trained for: I observe systems under stress. Okay. I'll give you some data points. You know what I'm thinking now? I'm thinking I never made enough money in this business. How do some of those pilots make so much money? I don't have a dime. Are you getting all that? Yeah. Yeah, getting all that. I'll tell you something else. I'll never get the Mars shot. You know why? I'm too old. How about that? Why are you doing that? - Relax, Buzz. - Don't tell me what to do. Hey, Buzz, you... You remember that psychologist at Brooks? The one with the blank sheet of paper? I don't remember. Sure. Sure, you remember. He held up a blank sheet of paper and said: "What do you see?" - I don't remember. - What did you see? Who, me? I saw a blank sheet of paper. No imagination. No, no. Devotion to truth. Why don't you take that Ph.D. And shove it? What are you gonna do when you finish that? Drop it out the window in a bottle? No, I'm the scientist. I rely on the pilot to get me places. If we'd had a couple more pilots, we'd be out there instead of laying here. Jim, what did you see when the psychologist held up the paper? They didn't have all that jazz when I came in. I saw a field covered with snow. And underneath, there was new oats. And then the snow melted, and the field turned to green. But the psychologist said I was wrong, it was just a blank sheet of paper. They took you anyway? Yeah, I guess they made a mistake. No, no. They don't make mistakes. That's right, I forgot. They don't make mistakes, do they? Ironman One. Ironman One, Goldstone, do you read? Yeah. Go, Goldstone. You might want to look out your window, Jim. What for? There's somebody down there that wants to say something to you. Say again? Why don't you look out your window? That's San Diego, Jim. Your hometown, saying hello. Suspended beneath the Air Force CA3 helicopter... ... the XRV is on its way to the launch pad. A flying wedge, shaped much like a thick arrowhead... ... the XRV has never before been in space. When it makes its first flight, Col. Dougherty will be going it alone... ... because that bird was designed for two men... ... but now has been modified, of course, to carry four men. Col. Dougherty will be on his way to bring home... ...the three astronauts of Ironman One. That XRV will plunge into the atmosphere... ... at 17,000 miles per hour, a flaming meteor coming back to Earth. When it breaks down into the lower atmosphere... ... the speed will drop to only a few hundred miles per hour... ... and Dougherty will be flying a high-speed glider... ... an airplane without power. He'll take that bird straight in towards Edwards Air Force Base... ... to land on the long runway out there in the California desert. Hello, Ted. Thirty-six hours and 15 minutes. Great, Ted. - What about the hurricane? - Heading straight for us. - When did it turn? - About six hours ago. - When do we get it? - 75-knot winds by 9:00. - They said it was headed to sea. - They were wrong. How in the hell can they make a mistake like that? Stop wasting your energy. It changed course once, it can change again. How are the children, Teresa? Fine. Mine are home studying for exams. Boy, they sure are putting the pressure on at school these days. It'll just be a minute. I should caution you. You're going to notice some degeneration. But it's important to show them how confident you are. We understand, Dick. We won't let you down. You want us to be confident? The more relaxed they are, the less oxygen they use. I know why we're here. You're letting us say goodbye. Wyman's report to contact. Celia? - Hi, Celia. - Hi, Frank. Celia? It's Jim. - Frank, take it off for a minute. - All right. Celia? Celia. Celia, we're gonna talk to him on the monitor up here. Celia. Well, here I am again. Celia? Well... ...everybody's been so nice. I spoke to your father today. And he says to say hello. His cold, it seemed better. I bought some new shoes. They hurt. And the kids? Oh, fine, fine. I lost the bill to the insurance. I thought I had it paid, and then just this morning, I got a letter. Listen, babe, I... I just want to tell you that I love you. What? I said, I love you. I just wanted you to know. I know that. I just wanted to make sure. Is it very Ionely where you are? No, not for long. We all have great confidence. Celia, if you have any more problems with the insurance... ... or the house or anything like that... ... you can talk to Dougherty. He's a good guy. You can depend on him. I gave him a kiss to give you when he sees you. Yeah, that's just what I need. You never can tell. - Well, I gotta go now. - No, not yet. Celia, I... I had a real good day today. And... ...you know, when you think about this... ...I want you to remember I had a real good day. Jim? We better cut it off now. Oh, there's one more thing that I have to tell you. I lost five pounds last week. I can't wait till you see me. You take care of yourself. Take care. Hi, sport. Hiya, kid. How are the mice? Well, we're learning something every day. You writing a big, dull book up there? No. No, a small, dull book. How are you? I'm working on a little project. I've developed an experimental hypothesis for you to proof out. Have you? Well, what is it? I miss you like mad. Yeah. Your paper came out last week. Professor Stavel said it's a brilliant presentation. It was the best he's ever read. We're gonna make it, Teresa. What? - We're gonna make it back. - What? We're gonna make it back. - I know. - Believe me. - Yes. - I mean it, we're all coming back. Listen, Teresa, I... I want you and the kids to... Look, I have to go now. - I'll be seeing you. - Stoney. I'll be seeing you. No, no. I love you, remember that. Remember that. Buzz? Yeah? General LeClair called all the way from Clark's Field. - I thought that was so nice. - Yeah. They want to give you something, a scroll or... Look, hon... ...you don't seem to understand, it's all falling apart up here. You understand? I understand, Buzz. You see... ... I broke the washing machine, and now I can't fix it. I understand how you feel. I could fix it if they'd give me the tools. But they won't. Listen, honey, I wrote something. We're all gonna sign it. - Do you want to hear it? - What? "To the president, the White House, Washington D. C: Dear Mr. President... ... we just wanted to let you know how much we appreciate... ...the heroic action to save our husbands. We are grateful to you and to everyone in the nation. The team effort of the past two days will be an inspiration to us... ... our children and our..." Don't you understand? It's all falling apart and they're blaming me. I don't feel very good. Buzz... ...I have to go now. I love you. I'll see you later. Can you give me a reading on your partial pressure of carbon dioxide? Thank you, Dick. I'll be all right. I just gave you that! Negative, Buzz. Negative, you gave me a PS... What difference does it make? What's going on down there? Why don't you get us out of here? Get ahold of him, Jim. Keep him away from the controls! - Get us out... - Sedate him, Jim, sedate him. Buzz? Come on. Buzz. Now just get us out of here, that's all! Come on! Come on! Leave me alone! Don't kill me! Don't kill me! It's not my fault! Why'd you bring in his goddamn wife? Keep him sedated, keep him away from the controls. Do you understand me? You just get Dougherty off the pad. He's tired, that's all. Everybody's tired. Fuel is complete. Your final numbers: Insertion into XRV, 8:36... ...hack sealed cabins burst, 8:42... ...liftoff, 8:48, rendezvous, 9:33. Roger, how's the wind? Thirty-two knots and climbing. - It's not changing course? - Nope. Well, Buzz, you're right. This whole damn thing is impossible. No, you were right. We're gonna do it anyway. We're in position for launch. - Do you read me, Ted? - Roger. Oxygen okay? - Flight network. - Go ahead. We have a problem with the liftoff on the KS system... ... but Fido's prepared to back it up. - Copy that, Fido? - Affirmative, Flight. All personnel in the control room be advised... ... that prior to 1:20, we'll call a hold if we have a problem. After 1:20, there is no hold. - Okay, EMIL, how you doing? - Go on three. - EMIL, repeated configuration, right? - That's right. All right. Raising the hatch cover. - Ted, request idea. Signal off. - Roger. - Ted, secure the hatch cover. - Roger. - Power supply off? - Verified. Hatch secured. - Your power supply, DC to off. - Roger. Lower the shroud. Good, steady. - Steady. - Easy.

Roger. Launch control, Houston Flight. Ask Rescue to prepare to copy. Ted, are you ready to copy computer updates? Launch control, this is Rescue, go ahead. Address: 6-0-2-4-9-7. Address: 6-1-3-5-6-7. Flight, this is Rescue, the computer's ready. - STC, this is LD. - Go ahead. - Ready to pick up at this time? - Roger, proceed. Pick it up on my mark, ALD. Three, two, one, mark. This is launch control at T-minus two minutes and counting. In just 60 seconds, we will start the count. Launch pad runs completely on internal power. This is launch control coming up on T-minus... We're now beginning to feel the real force of Hurricane Alma... ...making it difficult to speak. - LD, SRO. - Go ahead. - You have a clear to launch. - Roger. - LD, this is instrumentation. - Go ahead. I verify item four under two minutes. Roger. SRO, start range recorders and TV videotape recorders. Wilco. - LD, instrumentation. - Go ahead. Start and calibrate all instrumentation recorders. Roger. Minus 90 seconds and counting, mark. - Second stage, fuel and oxidizing. - Roger. - LD, this is instrumentation. - Go ahead. Start following the instrumentation calibration, SSB pre-fire. Instrumentation, PCM pre-fire. T-minus 70 seconds and counting, mark. T-minus 60 seconds and counting. - Hold! - Hold! Shut her down. Tower crew to launch pad, move in, Tower. The launch is scrubbed. The launch is scrubbed. Houston, Ironman. Houston, Ironman, do you read? Goldstone, this is Ironman, do you read? Guaymas, Ironman. Cape, this is Ironman. Pruett, this is Keith. I'm sorry, we had to scrub the launch. Yeah... I figured it might be like that, we've been watching the storm. How close did you get? T-minus 60 seconds. Now listen, Jim, we're still working on that engine. Boss... ... I just... I wanted to tell you... ... that you've done a great job, all of you. We know that you've all worked your tails off for us... ... and whatever happens to us, you can't let it affect the program. You've done a great job, really... ... and, you know, whatever it is that's hanging us up, it's nobody's fault. GBI reports loss of signal. Ascension will acquire the spacecraft, shall we remote you through? Nope. Move in, white room. Get the pilot out of there. - Ted. - Wait. - I want to speak to Keith. - I'm here, Ted. We've done everything we possibly could. We cannot launch. I'm telling you to launch! You get this haywagon off the ground! Now launch, damn it, Keith, launch this thing! Keith! Keith! I have a brief statement. The launch of the XRV rescue craft... ...was scrubbed at 8:47, Cape time. The pad was shut down at T-minus 58 seconds... ...when the wind velocity in the launch area rose to 48 knots. Commander Pruett in the Apollo Command Module has been informed. This... This was a very fine, fine effort. Do you have any questions? Mr. Keith, you say that the launch has been scrubbed. Are you going to reschedule at a later time? We have no plans. - Any future rescue attempts? - We have no plans. Mr. Keith, you say the men have been informed. Who informed them? I did. What was their reaction? Do you have any other questions? There's an assumption that the space program will be brought to a halt... ...for an investigation of the accident... ...plus a general examination of our purposes in space... ...and the morality of putting men into space without adequate... What's your question? Are the results you gained worth the lives you lost? You're damn right they are! Know what they accomplished living up there in a tin can for five months? Because of men like these, we've taken the first step off this little planet. The moon trip was a walk around the block. We're going to the stars, to other worlds, other civilizations. Mr. Keith? Men will be killed in this effort just as they're killed in cars and airplanes... ...and bars and... What is it? - Look at the numbers. - What about them? The numbers, Mr. Keith, the numbers! - In God's name... - What is that? In this disturbance, we have 90-knot winds. In the center, or eye, we have zero. The eye of the hurricane will pass over the Cape. All I wish to hear from each of you is yes or no. Go or no go. Do we have a launch window while the eye's over the Cape? We affirm a launch window at 2231:06. Can you launch your rocket through the eye? - Yes, sir. - Will the bird fly? Well, it's been kicked around by 80-knot winds. - The data's... - What's your judgment? It'll fly. - Carp? - Yes, sir? - Do we have 16 minutes in the eye? - No, sir, not 16. Do we have 14? We've been trying to get a chart from the computer... What's your judgment? I'll buy 14. Can we move the tower back in 12 minutes? You give the order and we'll do it. Houston, Flight. Is the rescue craft go for Point Charlie? We can have Point Charlie, but then pilot will be on his own. Rescue, can you rendezvous without an onboard computer program? You just get me in the ballpark. Then we are go for launch at 2231:06 local time. Roger, 2231:06 local time. Roger, 2231:06 local time. We'll recycle to T-minus 30. You know, of course, that by There's not enough oxygen left for three men to live that long. What about two men? We don't figure that way, we plot total pressure against total use. Is there sufficient oxygen for two men? For one? Two might just make it. - Go! - Move back service tower. This is launch control, we have just resumed the count. Col. Dougherty has confirmed... ... that all spacecraft systems are go at this time. Launch director is about to feed the computer update to the spacecraft. This is an unbelievable scene. No wind, absolute silence. Overhead... ...nothing but black night and brilliant stars... ...as the eye of the Hurricane Alma passes directly over us. There's an eerie hush over everything here. No rain, no wind. The lives of three men are measured by their fading heartbeats... ...and here on pad 41 at Cape Kennedy... ...we're in the middle of another heartbeat. It's a single moment in the life of a great storm... ...reprieve, we hope, for Pruett, Lloyd and Stone. The service tower is rolling away from the launch pad. As soon as it's 800 feet away it'll be locked into position... ...but they'll launch before that happens. That tower is expendable... ...but the three men in Ironman One are not. - LD, SRO. - Go ahead. - You have a clear to launch. - Roger. - LD, this is instrumentation. - Go ahead. Verify item four under two minutes. Roger. SRO, start range recorders and TV videotape recorders. Wilco. T-minus 70 seconds and counting, mark. - LD, instrumentation. - Go ahead. Start and calibrate all instrumentation recorders. T- minus 60 seconds and counting, mark. - Start instrument recorders. - Go. - SRM pressure sensor squibs. - Go. - Pyro sequence started. - Roger. T-minus 50 seconds and counting, mark. - XRV is go on internal. - Roger, all systems on internal. - Enable SRM regulators. - Go. T- minus 40 seconds and counting, mark. - Transfer TVC power. - Go. T-minus 30 seconds and counting, mark. - Pyro-initiators to on. - Go. - Launch panel to on. - Go. - Release control to on. - Go. T- minus 20 seconds and counting, mark. Stand by for a terminal count. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... - ... five, four, three, two, one. - I have ignition. - Go! Go! - All right, go, go! - Roll programmed. - Roger the roll. Pitch programmed. - Roger the pitch. - Mark, 50 seconds. Cabin pressure holding fine, .57. Mark one plus 40. PCS update in. You look good here. Go for staging. Roger, Ted, you are go for staging. Rescue, this is Flight, Fido confirms orbit insertion at 8:20. Roger. My initial rendezvous parameters... ...indicate Delta V of 263 feet per second. Timer burn T plus 12, plus 15. - Have Fido confirm my numbers. - Roger, stand by. Rescue, Flight. We show you right on the money. Go get them, kid. Cause of death will be anoxia. You know, that's an interesting way to go. The brain gets starved for oxygen. Ironman One, this is the Cape. Do you read? Just before the end you feel great and then you laugh it up. When you're ready to start singing and shouting... ...blackout. Ironman One, this is the Cape. Do you read? You know, that's an interesting mechanism. There's not much data on that either. Ironman One, this is Carnarva. Do you read? Ironman One, Redstone, do you copy? Ironman One, Houston CapCom, do you read? Ironman One, Houston CapCom, do you read? Ironman One, this is Houston Flight, do you read me? Ironman, this is Keith. What the hell do they want? Hello, Jim, I want to talk to you. Yeah, what do you want? I have some numbers for you. The eye of the hurricane passed over the Cape at 2218... ...and we had a second window at 2231:06, Cape time. We've successfully launched the rescue craft through the eye... ... do you understand? You have launched the XRV? Yes, that's correct, the XRV has completed staging... ... and is on its way to rendezvous. Our transfer will be at 2328. That's 55 minutes from now, do you read? Yeah, I read. Jim, how do you evaluate the oxygen situation? Well, we have whatever oxygen's left in the spacecraft system... ...and there are only two bottles of emergency oxygen onboard... ...five minutes each, that's 10 man-minutes. My backpack and Lloyd's and Stone's... ...but there's not much oxygen left in them. Well, you'll have to save your backpacks for the EVA transfer. Yeah, I know that. Fifty-five minutes. We'll be dead by then. Well, only if you continue to use oxygen at the present rate. Well, we can't cut down. Let's think about that. You want us to lower the partial pressure again? No, we've examined that. It won't work. Well, we're lying here like corpses now. What else can we do? You must think. Yeah, we're thinking. Are we talking about the same thing? Yeah. Why don't you talk it over? If you could work out something, it would be a great help. Yeah, we'll talk it over. I must point out that any effective action must be taken immediately. Look, don't tell me what to do! We've been taking your damned orders and where the hell are we?! From now on we're gonna make all of the decisions! Whatever we do, you're out of it! I appreciate what you're saying, Jim... ...and I agree with you, you're exactly right. Yeah, anything else? No, that's all at the moment. Would you please give me those launch numbers again? Yes, that's launch at 2231:06, Cape time... ...rendezvous and transfer at 2328. Thanks. Launch at 2231:06, rendezvous 2328. - That's what they say. - Fifty-five minutes to go. Through the eye of a hurricane. Jesus, 55 minutes. - Right. - We'll be pretty cold by then. Well... ...one of us is gonna have to go. I mean... ...that's what we're talking about, isn't it? One of us goes and the other two stay. Well... ...what are we gonna do? Look, let's do it scientifically. Two big guys throw the little guy out, okay? Yeah, well that's an idea. We're gonna have to talk about this. So, what are we gonna do? I could do it by chance. I'll tear out strips from a pad. One short, two long. The guy with the short end goes. Yeah. Oh, Jesus, we can't do that. No, we can't do that. Well look, I don't want to just lay here and die. All right, then figure the odds. Two guys, three guys, is that much difference? I say double the pills. No moving, no talking, pulse way down. Even when there's no pressure there's oxygen molecules floating around. You live for a while even when there's no pressure in the gauges. For God's sake, it's less than 55 minutes! - You're dreaming, Stone. - All right, okay. I'll go. I'm the weakest, I'm using up the most oxygen, I'll go. It's all right. All right, all right. All right, get your helmets on. I'm going out to fix the engine. Are you kidding? You can't fix that engine. What the hell do you know about it? I don't know why I let them talk me out of it. I should've done this two days ago. Come on, get your helmets on. He'll fix it. He's good, he'll fix it. You son of a bitch. You know what he's doing up there. - Buzz, don't! - Jim! - Get back in here. - Jim, don't do it! You're going to rip out the umbilicals. Jim, don't do it. Jim! Jim. Jim, don't do it. Jim! Stoney. Stoney, give me some line here. - Stoney? - We can't get to him. Yes? Mrs. Pruett, I wanted to talk to you. Mrs. Pruett... ...your husband is dead. It was an accident. He was trying to repair the spacecraft. I'm sorry. Jim? Jim? I told you, Jim's not here. He had an accident. Where's Stoney at? I'm here. Stoney? Dougherty's coming. Stoney, tell Jim to get us out of here. Stop eating your oxygen, damn you! Be still! Range 76.8. I've got to hit it. I'm a little under the line. Rescue, Flight. Do you confirm burn attitude? - Roger, attitude is go, Delta V 63. - Roger, Ted, this is the one. Roger, three, two, one. Oxygen. Can't. Can't, gotta save it for the transfer. I'm dying. - I'm dying. - No, you're not dying. It takes a long time to die. Ironman, this is Rescue. Ironman, this is Rescue. - Read you. - Turn on your acquisition lights. Say again? Come on, Stoney, turn on your acquisition lights. Roger. Roger, acquisition lights. Okay, Stoney, I'm coming right down the pipe. I'll see you in six minutes. Six minutes, roger. Buzz, six more minutes. Only six more minutes, Buzz. - I can't. - You can, Buzz. You've got to. - I can't. - You can, Buzz. Think of something. Think of... Think of the Earth, Buzz. Look at the Earth, Buzz. Look, can you...? Can you tell where we are? Stoney? All right, Buzz. All right. All right, Buzz, you're on my air now. Take a breather. I'm going back on cabin air. There must be some left. Ironman, this is Keith. Ironman, this is Keith, do you read me? Purpose... ...and objective. Ironman One, this is Keith, do you read? Purpose... ...and objective. Ironman, this is Keith, do you read me? Purpose: The acquisition of... ...data. Ironman, do you read me? No. Oh, God. Oh, God. How beautiful. I'm beginning to see... ...visions... Stoney, come in. ...of death. There you are. Ironman, this is Keith. Ironman, a Russian spacecraft is making rendezvous with you. Do you see a Russian spacecraft? Come in. Stoney, do you see a Russian spacecraft? I see him. Good. Now 30 minutes ago he made a change in orbit. He is moving towards you for rendezvous. We don't know what he's going to do. All you can do at this point is watch him. Watch him. Stoney, do you read me? He... He's stopping. He's opening up. He's coming out. He wants me to do something. I think he wants me to open the hatch. Stoney, what is your oxygen readout? Your oxygen readout? Oh, it's zero-zero. No, no. No, that... That can't be right. I'm... I'm breathing something. Now, Stoney, listen to me. I want you to follow through with the Russian. Don't wait for Dougherty. - Is Dougherty here? - Dougherty is not there. The Russian is there. He wants you to open your hatch. Oh, God, I'm tired, Charles. - I'm tired. - Stoney, put on your helmet. Open the hatch. Open the hatch. Open... All right. - Blow hatch. - Negative, do not blow the hatch. Open it with the lever, the unlocking lever. Do you read me, Stoney? Stoney? Flight, this is Rescue, I've got their light. Roger, Ted, you've got their acq lights. Blow hatch. - Blow the hatch. - Do not. Do not blow the hatch! Hatch blown. He can't get any closer, Buzz. We have to go to him. I've got visual on them now. I'm gonna brake down to 10. They're about 50 feet apart. The Apollo hatch is open. - Can you see the crew? - Negative. I'm gonna go in a little closer. There's a light flashing from the Russian ship. Some guy's floating about 150 feet below me. I'm going after him. Ironman, this is Keith, do you read me? Come in, Ironman. Ironman, this is Keith, come in. Ironman One, this is Keith, do you read? Ironman, this is Keith, do you read me? Ironman, do you read me? Keith, this is Rescue. I'm in the Apollo. The Russian got air to Stoney... ...and I've transferred him to my oxygen. He's all right, he's breathing. And I've got Lloyd. Ted, get back to the XRV and prepare for re-entry. Roger, I'm on my way. Ten, nine, eight, seven... ...six, five, four, three, two, one.
