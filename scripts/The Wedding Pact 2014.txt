Excuse the cliche, but they say that time flies when you're having fun. And I don't know about you guys, but I have had the best time of my life here at Madison college. Now... Point me to the keg. - Look in the mirror, mascara smeared sipping belvedere LA LA like a superstar stunner shades, oh, it's so cliche she's no grenade - What a douche. - Bring it in here, girls. - Why do I get the feeling we'll be calling Bob senator one day? In 20 years, that guy's gonna be the president. - Everybody's having a good time. I'm already having a good time. - Dude. - Hey! Don't start with me. - Look, the first semester, she was totally single, and you were actually the first person to meet her. - Yeah, I know. I know I blew it, okay? I mean, usually I got pretty good game. But, you know, I get around Elizabeth and I get all loopy. - Yeah, well... Speaking of game, how'd the breakup go with Rosie? - What do you mean, how'd it go? She kicked me in the nuts. - Ooh. Were you wearing? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. You had to know that was coming. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, here she comes. - Hi, guys. - Hey! - Hi. - Hey. - What are you guys talking about? - Baseball and... - Oh. Guy stuff? - Yeah. - So macho. - Yeah. - Yeah, let me get... who wants a beer? - Yeah, I'll have... - beer? Two beers, three beers? - I'm okay. Thank you. So... Tomorrow's graduation. It's crazy, right? - I know, right? It's like four years went by like that. - Yeah. You should fly to visit me in San Diego. - Mm... Yeah, I don't know. - You don't... you don't know if you wanna come see me? - No, no, it's not... it's not what you think. It's... You know. What I told you. - Oh, the claustrophobia stuff. - Yes, I... - I kinda thought you were kidding about that. - No. I don't kid about that. I thought it was just elevators and things like that. - Yeah, it is, but then it kicks in pretty good The whole fear of plunging to a fiery, screaming death tends to amplify it a bit. - Right. - We can talk about something else. - Sure. But I do want you to come visit me. - Okay. - Lizzie! - Um, hold on one second. I guess maybe one regret that I have is that, you know, with all the stupid boyfriends and girlfriends that we both had that you and I never gave it a shot. Let's make a deal, Mitch. In ten years, if we haven't married other people, we marry each other. What do you say? - Lizzie! We're gonna leave without you. - Okay. Hold on. What do you say? - Sure! - I love you so much, Mitch. - I love you too. - Okay. I'll see you soon. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Huh? So? How'd it go? - To be honest, I think I just got engaged. Now listen, I know what you're all thinking. Yeah, right, he's gonna wait ten years to marry her. I will admit, I did think about it. For about a month. Now, as you can see, when I go on the first date, I got it down pretty good. I mean, look at the way they laugh at my jokes. You can't fake that. Although with women, you never really can tell. But first date... I'm king. When we get a little deeper in the relationship... - Mitch, this is the best birthday dinner ever. You'd better be careful, mister. I might just use the "I" word tonight. - That's when things go kablooey. It's your birthday? - Don't ever call me again. - For the last time, my name is Eleanor, not Elizabeth, jerk! - Well, ten years later, I'm still single. And I heard that Elizabeth already got married, so I guess it's just not meant to be. - Okay. This is from me. - Thank you, Karen. - Happy Birthday, Mitch. - Thank you. Oh, my gosh. Oh, come on. Look at that. - Nice watch. What'd that run you? - Easy! Thank you, Karen. You're welcome. - Seriously, I, uh, I feel truly blessed to have friends like you. Are these wonderful gifts are just too much, so... - You're welcome! - Thank you. Most of you. - Is this a party, or what? - Look at you! You made it! - Hey, dude, I took the last ferry from montauk, got here in no time. - And yet, you never visit. - Nice hat. - Thank you very much. This is my good friend Dave breem from college, everybody. - This a birthday party or a funeral? Come on! - Funeral. - Hey, hey, hey, easy. Now, who scored this month's bonus and is picking up tonight's check, huh? - To Mitch. To Mitch. - Thank you very much. - Salud. - Waitress! Another round. Cheap stuff? - Good night, ladies! - Hey, guys, it's last call. Would you like anything else before I close out your tab? - No, I think just the check, thanks. - Uh, um... I would like to buy me and my buddy two shots of whiskey. Why don't you, uh... Keep the change? Huh? - You always know the right thing to do, man. - That is because I'm the ying to your Yang.

Man, if she only waited, we would have been great together. - Yeah, I know. - Eh. Stupid to think a girl like her can go ten years and not find somebody. I mean, it's not like I didn't try. I mean, I scoured the Internet, you know? Facebook, Twitter... nothing. This woman's off the grid. Thank you. - Well, what if I told you... - oh, my God, who ordered the cabo? Seriously, I said bottom shelf, guys! You know what? I bet you it was damn Carl. - Dude, would you stop? In two seconds, you're not even gonna care about that. - Yeah, that I'd like. - Then this you'll love. You sitting down? - Yeah, Dave. I'm sitting down. - Okay, okay. She never got married. - No way. - Yes, way! - No, no, no, 'cause I read in the alumni mag... are you messing with me? - I'm not messing with you. - Don't mess with me. - I'm not messing with you. In fact, I'm trying to help you. I read the same thing too. But I called the alumni office. She never got married. This is her last known address in San Diego. - San Diego. Happy Birthday! It's meant to be, man! - This might be meant to be. - This is really meant to be. - This might be meant to be. - I'll drink to that. - Mmm! - Oh, my God. Ugh... - Give me my change! Dude, there's such better Mexican in this town. Why do you keep going to this dump? - 'Cause it's got... it's fiesta hour. We got, you know, free drinks. - Uhh... But it's... ugh. So what are you gonna do? - Be honest? Probably same thing I've always done... nothing. - Can I be honest? That's stupid, man. Come on... go after the girl! - She lives a long way away, and I am terrified of flying. - Then drive. - What about my job? - You hate your job. - What about my fish? - I'll feed your fish. - What about my plants? - I'll water 'em. - What if she doesn't love me back? - Well, what if she love me back? - All right.

Some people might think it's crazy. Or creepy. But I think it's romantic. toing and froing gotta get 'em now, gotta get your goal gotta figure out what the hell you know on your own time to push the envelope, runnin' out of rope slipping down the slope, looking for answers I can't seem to find - Bam.

Who is she, and what's her name? - What do you mean? Uh... Elizabeth. I haven't seen her since college, and we made this pact back then that if we weren't married in ten years, we were gonna marry each other. So here it is ten years later, and, uh... I'm gonna track her down. - You made the old friend college ten-year pact? - Sounds kinda dumb when you say it like that. - No, it is kinda dumb. - Maybe, but... I have to try. - Are you sure? - If I had a nickel for every time a beautiful woman like yourself tried to take me to bed, including right now... - You'd have a nickel? - Maybe a dime. - Well, she's lucky to have you, even if she doesn't know it. - Thank you. - I would love to find some guy to take me away from this life. - You? I'm sure you have plenty of offers. - I seem to be attracted to losers. - Wait a minute. Did she just call me a loser? I haven't felt that awkward since my first day of college. - Here we go. - Whoop! Yeah. - College! - All right! Got in. - Mitch. - Oh. I'm Dave. - Hey. Cool! - Okay, all right. This'll work.

All good. - Actually, I'm glad you're awake. - Oh, really? - My brother and his friends are outside, and he'd like to meet you. - Your brother what? - He'd like to meet you. - Do you think that's a good idea? I mean, he seems... Pretty busy with the boys and all. - Laura! Get your sorry butt out here with your friend now. - Rudy, don't push me! Mitch is getting dressed and will be out in a minute! Sorry. - That's okay. - If you could... If you could just get dressed and come out with me, it would be really great. - I'll be out in a sec. - Okay.

I don't know how you read that day after day. Doesn't it drive you nuts? - If you don't read about what's going on in this country, Elizabeth, how can you expect to be an educated voter? - Vote? What's that? Mom, I'm kidding. God. - I was thinking of going over and taking in a movie today. Care to join me? - I would love to, but I have an appointment with Mrs. Stanton and her kids. - The family you sponsor? - Yeah. They're part of my training. Three weeks, and then I'm a full-time social worker. And I have to go get ready for work. What time did they say buddy was gonna be ready? - 5:00. - Thank you. - Turn on rush in the car. - She must be unlisted, 'cause I got nothing. - No, I know, I tried... I tried everybody.

Then what's this then? - What the hell am I supposed to do with that? - Fine. Choke on it. - Hey! Is that how you want her to remember the big question? Listen, do you know how long some people wait their whole lives to be with the one person they love, and you two morons have found each other, and you're wasting precious time acting like children. Now, she obviously loves you if she's jumping in a car with a complete stranger... Right? - Right. - Looking to get your attention. Now, he obviously loves you if he's willing to go to prison for life over you. - Well, it'd probably be 10 to 12 for good behavior. - The point is the two of you are right here right now, and you know what you want. - I'm so sorry, baby. I just get worried you're gonna leave me. - I love you so much, and I want you to be my one and only. - Oh, Eddie, I just want you so bad right now. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Why don't you hop back here and give me some of that sweet-smelling sugar. - I'm, uh...

I got beaten up. - I'm speechless! - No. It's really you. - It's really me. - You look great. - I was just about to say the same thing about you. - So what are you doing here? You look like you need to tell me something. Are you sick? You're not sick, are you? - No. No, no. Uh... What about you? Last I heard, you were married. - Hmm. Uh, no, not yet. I was going to, and that didn't happen. It wasn't, um... Really my choice. What about you? - Me. - Mm-hmm. Married? - I would have thought you'd be married by now. - Funny you should say that. - Why? - It's... It's funny because I... I, um... Have to go to the bathroom, and I will be right back. - Okay. - Excuse me. Oh, come on, Mitch. Get it together, man! You've been waiting on this. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be good. You got this. You got this. Really. 'Cause now you're talking to your penis. That's fantastic. Great. Elizabeth... We made a promise to each other ten years ago. I'm here to honor that promise. I'm here to say to you, "will you marry me?" I'm sorry. - Good luck, bro. - Jake, remember how I told you about my college best friend who was a guy, and you said that it was impossible for guys and girls to be friends, 'cause the guy always wants to get in the girl's pants? - Well, no, babe, what I actually said was only guys who are friends with attractive women can't be. - Jake Jones, meet my college best friend Mitch Becker. - How you doing? - Nice to meet you. - Oh, wait a minute. I do remember! Yeah, from some of the college photos that you showed me. - Yes! - I didn't recognize you without that perm. - Ha ha ha. - Knock it off. - I'm just messing around. Friend? - Friends. - Good. That's better. Because I could not have you come to my wedding hating my fiance. - Huh? - Jake and I are getting married. - Really? Congratulations. When? - Ten days. - That's fantastic! - You should stay for the wedding! Would you? - Well, while he contemplates that, I'll go ahead and pay the check. - I'll get it. - Okay. - Just tell him I'll be there in a sec. I'm on my way, okay? God! Oh, wait a minute. I have something for you. - You do? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here you go. - No! Babe, it's beautiful. Thank you. - Wait a minute. I just gave you a wedding ring. I need a little something extra than that. Mmm. - Mm. Thank you. - She didn't think I could get the ring resized in time for the wedding. - I didn't say that. - But I did, and she was wrong. Like she always is. - Okay, don't listen to him. I am not always wrong. - Oh, really? What about the Christmas party last year... remember? - You're gonna bring up the Christmas party? - Yeah, I'm... you gotta hear this, rich. This is hysterical. - Mitch. - We're at this lame Christmas party last year, something for her mom's whatever. - Nice. - They finally break out this karaoke machine, so I start doing a couple of ll cool j songs. It was hilarious. Seriously. - Honestly, it was awful. - It was awesome. Are you kidding? The early stuff. Not the later crap. Anyway, so we get ready to leave at the end of the night and then Elizabeth here starts dousing her Debbie downer spray all over the place, getting on my case about drinking too much, having too much fun, we gotta call a cab. - So did you? - No, I didn't call a cab. She called a cab. But I was fine to drive. - No, you weren't. That's why I called the cab. - Point is is that she was wrong. She was wrong about that. She's wrong about this thing. She's wrong a lot of the time. - I think we get it, okay? - I think it's cute, though. - Hey, okay. Um... How about where I could get a hotel around here. - No. You'll just stay with me and my mom. - Whoa, whoa, we got a big week ahead of us. We got the wedding. We got the race. - What race? - Jake and I have been training for this couples marathon for like six months. - Couples marathon. - Yeah. It's a pretty big deal. They only let like 12 couples even do it. - You should come with us tomorrow. - What, you want him to go to the race too? Yeah, fine, why don't you come to the bridal shower while you're at it? - Well, I don't want to impose. - You're not imposing, and I'm not gonna take no for an answer. We have the perfect guest room. - Okay. - And you'll stay for the wedding? - Sure. - It's gonna be just like old times! - Just like old times. - Sweetheart, we really gotta get going. - I have to go see Jake's dad for a couple of things for the wedding, but I'll see you at the house. Do you remember how to get there? - Yeah, yeah. It's in the GPS. - Okay. See you. - Later, rich. - It's Mitch. Turn left. In one mile, turn left. You have arrived at your destination. - Yello. - Yeah, hey, it's me. - Oh, hey! - Yeah, good job, nostradamus. She's getting married in ten days. - All right, that's great! - No, not to me. - Oh... I did not predict that. - Yeah. I got a prediction. When I get home, I'm gonna... - Hi. - Hi, Joyce, how are you? - Good to see you. - You too. - Could you please tell my father I'm here to see him? - Sure. - Thanks. Sir, your son is here. No, he's with Elizabeth. Oh, okay. You can go in. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Oh, I'm sorry. He just said Jake, Elizabeth. - Ah. It's okay. Just go. Damn it. - Didn't I tell you to come alone? - She was with me. What could I do? - You drop her off at home on the way. Have a seat. - What do you want, dad? - Big Chinese exporter's thinking about hiring this firm. - That's great, but what does that have to do with me? - It always has something to do with you. Don't you wanna run this firm one day? - Are you thinking about letting me handle the account? - No. What, do you think I'm crazy? - Then why am I here, dad? - Um... You and, uh, you and her doing okay? I mean, the wedding's still on? - Well, if by her you mean Elizabeth, then the answer's yes, the wedding's still on. - She sign the prenup? - So that's it? Good old dad looking out for the family interests? And forget about love, but let's just make sure the money's safe, right? - Did she sign the prenup? - Yeah. Yeah, she signed it. Two days ago. - Well, that's good, son. That's good. I can't afford any... I mean, we can't afford any problems, any surprises. The Chinese believe that a good home life is essential to a good work life, and their vetting process is extremely thorough. Any shenanigans could blow this whole deal, and we're talking big dollars. I would appreciate it if you didn't embarrass your family or this firm. - Not to worry, dad. I'll do my best not to embarrass you. - Good. Now that we're on the same page, you can go. - Is this it right here? - Yeah, this is it. Oh, buddy, get down! - Oh, that's okay, Mrs. Carter. I'm a dog person. - Good news for you, buddy. Look, I call you Mitch. Why don't you just call me Donna? - Okay. Thank you, Donna. - You're welcome. You're welcome. If you need anything, ask buddy. - Okay. - All right? I'll be right downstairs. - Thank you. - Hi. Now what, huh? - You're not gonna say anything about what just happened in there? - You know, I think it's really ridiculous that you got this guy staying at your place. - Who, Mitch? What's wrong with Mitch? - Elizabeth, it's ten days before our wedding. Now, all of a sudden, you have some ex-boyfriend... - he's not my ex-boyfriend. - That's right. He's your best friend. And ten days before our wedding, he decides to shack up with you at your place? - Oh, come on. - Actually, it's not even your place, though, is it? It's my place. I... I can't believe you would throw that in my face. You knew my mom and I's situation. You're the one that came up with the idea for us to live there. I don't know what your dad said to you up there, but please stop taking it out on me, okay? - You gonna sign the prenup? - What? - Are you gonna sign the prenup? - Jake, I haven't even really had a chance to read... - Elizabeth, I really need you to sign that. - Well, I've had a lot on my mind with the race and the wedding. I'm working... - Really? You've had a lot on your mind? I've had a lot on my mind too. I've had the race on my mind, the wedding on my mind. I have this prenup on my mind that you seem to never want to talk about. Now guess what... now I have Mitch on my mind. Thanks for that. Some dweeb I don't even know who's staying with my-soon-to-be wife in the house that I paid for. - I really don't want to talk to you about this right now, okay? Can you please just take me home? - Fine. I'm sorry. I love you. - Love you too. Welcome back. Okay, now there has been a lot of talk about voter fraud, and we are here to discuss... - hey, Donna? - Hey. - Yeah, I was gonna go grab a beer. Is anyplace close by? - Oh. Up the street, there's lucky's. - Perfect. Can you tell Elizabeth where I am? - Of course. I think buddy and I can handle that. Right, buddy? Have fun. - Thank you. Ooh! Ah-oh! - Hey, groin shots are off-limits. Anything else is fair game. - Hi. - Hey. What can I get you? - I'll just have a beer, please. - Sure. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Would you like to start a tab? - Sure. - Aah! - What is that? - It's called the whipping post. I'll have a beer too. Put it on this guy's tab. - Oh! Where's Elizabeth? - I dropped her home. - Ah. What are you doing here? Don't you have a big race tomorrow? - What are you doing here? - I'm just having a beer. - No. What are you doing here? - Why would anybody do that to themselves? - I knew you were a wussy from the moment I met you. - I'm not a wussy. I'm just not stupid. - Oh, yeah? Prove it. - No. See? Wussy. - You actually challenging me to a rat tail competition? - Tell you what. Bet 1,000 to your 100 you tap out first. - Hey, everybody. Jake just bet $1,000 to... I'm sorry, what's your name? - Bitch. - Mitch. - To Mitch that he can take him in the whipping post! Whipping post, whipping post! Whipping post, whipping post, whipping post, whipping post, whipping... - let's do this. - Whipping post, whipping post! Whoo! - Let's do it! Okay, mates, here are the rules. Trade off whips with your towels until someone taps out. You tap out, you lose. No head or groin shots. Everything else is fair game. If after five whips there's still no winner, we dunk those towels in ice water, boys. Understand? - Yeah, I understand... - Yeah, okay. Let's whip it out, boys. - So, uh, you know, how does this get going here? - Are these regulation towels? - Oh! - Ooh! - See that, see that? Kick his ass, Nate! - Come on. - See what you got. Ow! - Seems kinda dumb. Ah! - Wanna tap out? - I'm good. Okay. Okay. - Sure you wanna do this, college friend? Ow! God! - Right in the nipple. - That's a good shot. Good shot. - Need a break in this, or what? - No, we keep going. Oh. - Whoo! Man, what... oh, God! - Oh! - That was right there! That was... - sorry. I don't know. I've never done it before. - Keep your whips up. - All right, I'll keep it up. - Get this guy? - We keeping score or... - Ooh! - That was a little high.

Can't he move it around a little bit? - You all right? - Yeah! One-trick pony? Oh, what were the rules again? - Mm! Aah! - These two idiots have actually made it to the wet whip. It is now time for these two fools to whip each other at the same time. - Just bow out, man. - That's not gonna happen. You bow out. - Let's go. Come on. - Okay, let's whip it out, boys. - Let's whip it out. Hey! Are you both crazy? That's it. Show's over. - Boo! - Come on! - What were you both thinking? - Talk about this tomorrow? - I'm good with that. - I'm taking Mitch home. And I'm gonna see you at 10:00 A.M. What is that, your mom? Ha ha ha! Come on! - You had him, Jake. - Thanks. - Somebody should tend to those wounds, but you're definitely too drunk to drive. - You got any suggestions? - I live right upstairs. - Tell me what the hell are you thinking of when you say you say that I'm not everything you want Ah... Ohh... Oh! Gah! Ah! - What the hell were you thinking? Do you need some help? - If you've come to yell at me, I think I'm suffering enough as it is. - I'm not gonna yell at you. - Here. - What the hell were you thinking? - Oh, my gosh. Oh... Ah! - I'm sorry. Ow... - Oh, my gosh! Where did you find this? - Oh. Friggin' Dave. He was busting my balls about that, so... - You ate so many hot dogs that day. - 27. I remember every one of them. - I ate a lot too. - If memory serves, you had three. - Three is a lot. - Three's a lot? - Yes. I mean, not as many as 27, but... - Well, no, yeah, look at my face, and, you know, look at yours. - We're babies. Okay. I'm off to bed. Good night. - Good night. Hey. Don't you judge me. You wanna sleep together? - College. - College. Come on, open! Hi. - Hi. - I can't get my door open. You think you could help me out? - Your door... Oh, that's nice. - Yeah, it's stuck. - Um... Your door's stuck. Yeah, let me, uh, let me take a look. - All runners should be making your way to registration now. He said 10:00 A.M. Right? - Yeah. - Maybe he got held up. - I don't know, but I can't wait for him anymore. I'm gonna go register, okay? - We'll be right here, honey. - Donna, what's the deal with this guy? I don't know. Oh, Mitch, I don't know. Speak of the devil... - Hey! Hey, where have you been? And what... why aren't you dressed for the race? - What... what? Oh, my God! Are you drunk? - No, I'm not drunk. I was drunk. I'm just hung over now. - Mitch, could you grab his stuff? - Hey, don't... don't... don't touch my stuff, bro. All right? - If she sees you like this, it will kill her. - Relax, Donna. Give me a break. Where is she? - She's at registration. - Hey, I wasn't talking to you, dirt bag! You know, we could finish what we started last night if you want. - All right, let's go, 12-step. - Oh, great. That's what I thought. Let's do this thing. Ow! Ow! - Nate... Get away from me! Ah... Uh... - I'll go find a doctor. - What happened? - You do that! - Whatever happens, do not tell Elizabeth you've been drinking. - Just quit yelling at me! God, I have a headache! - Good luck to you. - Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. - Team name. - Welcome back, Carter. - Okay. Here you go. These are for you. - Thanks. - I'll see you at the starting line. - Okay. - Next. Team name. - I'm not gonna be too sure until I look at some x-rays. But what I see so far looks like a high ankle sprain. - Ow! Ow! - Oh, no, what happened? Speak. - I-it was a freak accident, babe. I stepped out of the car and I rolled my ankle. - Is that the truth? Mitch. - It's pretty much what I saw. - Do you think there's any possibility of him running today? - Babe, he's a doctor. I can't run. - Like I say, I gotta look at some x-rays. - So that's it? What about Mrs. Stanton and her kids? - I think the pledges will understand. - Final call for registration. - I don't think so. - Well, we're not gonna find out, 'cause I'll run. - What? - If you'll have me. - I will so have you. Can you handle Jake? Mitch and I have a race to run. - Wait, whoa... wait, wait, wait... - go get 'em, guys. - Wait, I... - shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. - Ow! - All couples should be making their way to the starting line. - I got it, I got it. - How long is this thing anyway? - Probably best if you don't know. Just remember, keep an even pace and remember that you're doing it for Mrs. Stanton and her kids. - Mrs. Stanton and her kids. Right. Okay. This gonna mess up my pedicure? - The Pasadena couples marathon is about to begin. - I should have gone to the bathroom first, right? - Ladies and gentlemen, do not break your connection, or you will be disqualified. Also, make sure you stay in the course, especially when you hit trail hill. - Trail what? - Shh! - There... there's a hill? - In your position. On your marks... Get set... - But you took control of me you pulled the rug from under my feet so this is the way it's supposed to be I never knew a love like this when I was searching forever to find someone better to show me a love like this - Ow! - Oh, stop complaining. - Donna, I can do it by myself, all right? - Oh, shut up. I'm helping. - I can't believe she's running that race with Mitch. I bet they don't even finish. - Oh, ho! She will. I just hope Mitch survives. - Jesus is on the main line tell him what you want oh, Jesus is on the main line tell him what you want Jesus is on the main line tell him what you want call him up and tell him what you want Jesus is on the main line tell him what you want oh, Jesus is on the main line tell him what you want Jesus is on the main line tell him what you want call him up - good job, guys. - And tell him what you want - So he just stepped in, huh? - I know. Crazy, right? - Yeah. Well, we have checkpoints all over this place. If they were to have quit, we would have found out by now. - Come on, baby! Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! Come on, baby! - Oh, wow. - Whoo, whoo, whoo. Are you all right? Are you all right? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Oh, my gosh. - Hey, hey. You okay? - Oh, my gosh! Should we call an ambulance? Oh! - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. Put your arm around me. Hold on. Oh, look at this. Oh, my God! - Go, Lizzie! - You all right? - Mitch! Here, sweetheart. Oh, my God. You okay? Come on. - As I get closer and closer to Elizabeth, I'm beginning to feel more and more confident about this. - Morning, sunshine. - Good morning, mommy. Mommy? - You're not my mom! - Mm-mm. Good thing. - Oh. Oh, God, it hurts to move. - I figured it would. That way, you can't kick me out. - Doesn't it remind you of when we were camping? I could stay here all day. - I don't think I have a choice. I think I left my credit card at the bar the other night. - Lizzie! Are you up? - Uh, yeah. - Just got a call from the wedding photographer. He needs to change his appointment to 10:30 A.M. tomorrow. - Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome! - I actually forgot I had that appointment today. - I'm sorry, Liz, I have to ask. - Yes? Why are you marrying this guy? - Excuse me? - No, I'm just saying, it's... From what I've seen, you're not very happy with him. And if you don't mind me saying, he's kind of a dick. - Wow. - What, you disagree? - What would you like for me to do, Mitch? Do you want me to dump Jake and marry you? - And who do you think you are, you're gonna come here after ten years and you're gonna judge me? - Wait a second. For... ow. For your information, I barely made it through Texas coming out here to find you. If I want to judge, I'll judge! - Okay, now we're gonna play that card? The "I worked so hard to find you"? Come on, give me a break. - It's no card. - Fine. I'll bite. Laura! There he is. - Hey, Rudy... - come here, you! Bring it in. Bring it in. So... I heard you're spending the night at my sister's. - Uh, yes, sir. - Did you have sex with her yet? - Rudy! - Sorry. I'm just kidding. But I heard she's good. I'm just kidding! Hey, would you like to hang out with us a bit? Me and my boys, we're gonna be hanging around the fire, saying a couple chants. - What kinda chants? - Well, number one, our lord and savior, j. C. - J... - Jesus Christ. - Right. Can I ask what the bonfire's about? I mean, don't you guys usually burn... Crosses? - Whoa, whoa. Who do you think we are? - K.K.K.? - What would make you say that? - It might have something to do with the white robes. - Laura, first of all, they're not white... they're taupe. - You've heard of the hell's angels? - Of course. - Well, they are the heaven's angels. - Oh... - We're a small group, but we're growing fast. - The robes are what they call angel shrouds. - Yo, Rudy, the boys are getting restless waiting on you. How much longer we gotta wait? - Would you like to join us for our ceremony this evening? - If I refuse? - I'll just have the boys come over and, uh, they'll just kick the snot outta you. - Let's chant! - All right, well, you boys have fun. I'm outta here. - You're going? - Oh, yeah. - Let's go. - Okay. - Yeah. A biker gang called the heaven's angels in Texas? That's ridiculous. - Rudy turned out to be a really nice guy. He gave me his card. - You know what? Jake proposed to me, I said yes, and we're getting married. - Well, great. Good. Fine. Good for you! - You know... Buddy! Come on, let's wake Mitch up! Wait... no, bu... no. Buddy, n-n... Aah! - Excuse me. - Oh, hey, man. Sorry. We don't open for another hour. - Yeah, I know. I was in here the other night. I think I left my credit card. I was... Playing the, uh, whipping post. - Yes! I remember you! You're awesome! - Thank you. - Yeah. No, man, you're one tough son of a bitch! - Thank you. Uh, the credit card. - Oh, you don't just like staring at each other awkwardly. Sorry. I'll be right back. - Thank you. I'll call you later. - What are you doing here? - Picking up my credit card. What are you doing here? - Nothin'. I don't know what you think you saw here, but, uh... You didn't see anything. - Didn't say I did. - Good. - Mr. Mitch Becker... Here you go. - Thank you. - Oh, and on tabs this high, we automatically add 20%. - You have a pen? - Probably. - I only got a few minutes, whoever you are. I... oh. - Hello, Donna. - Stanley Jones. What brings you out here? - Well, for starters, I was hoping that you would fix me one of your delicious cups of coffee. The house looks great. - Thank you. - How's Elizabeth? I understand that she has an old friend in town visiting. - Oh, Mitch. He drove all the way from Boston to see her. She's so excited. They haven't seen each other since college. - How heartwarming. - You've never been good at smalltalk, Stan. Why are you here? - I just wanna make sure that she's going forward with this wedding. - Well, of course she is. Why would you... you don't think... Oh, Stan! They're just friends. Trust me. You have nothing to worry about. - You're right, Donna. I'm not very good at small talk. I want your assurance that my son's wedding is gonna go off without a hitch. It would be a shame if I had to... Sell certain assets in order to make up my losses. - Well, let me be perfectly clear. You can be well assured that the wedding will go on as planned. - Thank you. I can get the key in, but then when I turn it... oh! Just the new paint sticking to the door. Thank you. - Oh, I'm Elizabeth Carter. - Hi, Elizabeth. - And you are... - Oh. I'm bitch maker. Mitch. Becker. - Fourth floor. What the hell? Hey, roomie. - Hi. Mm. Uh, well, I'll leave you two alone. - You know, we should hang out some time. - Gr-oss! - That'd be great. See ya. - Yeah. Bye. - Bye. - What happened to you, man? - Oh, I just fell in love. - I just got high in the quad. - College. - College. - Hey, hey. - Hey. - Somebody had a long day at work, huh? - Yes. - Care to join me? You know I hate drinking alone. - Sure. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Cheers. Listen, Elizabeth, I want to apologize for the way... - No, Mitch, honestly, I'm the one that owes the apology. After I thought about it, I can totally understand why you felt that way about Jake. - Listen, I don't even know him... - no, no, just... Let me finish, okay? This is kind of difficult for me to say. My parents always thought that they'd retired here. And then my dad died suddenly, and both of us were really devastated. Six months later, I'm living in Los Angeles and I'm about to get married, and then that didn't happen because I found my fiance in bed with my best friend. My life was kinda going nowhere. I felt like... Felt like I needed to move home, and then once I got here, I found out my mom was about to lose the house. She got caught up in one of those refinancing schemes, and she had no choice but to sell or be foreclosed. - Mm. Wow. - That's when I met Jake. He came to look at the house and pretty soon realized that all he could do was look at me. I know it sounds really silly, but after what I had been through, it felt really nice. We went to dinner. I explained our situation. And shortly after that, he bought the house and said that we could stay. - For free? - His family has a lot of money. - Ah, I see. For free as long as the two of you are together. - It's really not like that. He proposed. I said yes. And here we are. - What can I say about that? - I guess I don't really need you to say anything. - Thank you. - Woman... - shh. - Potter residence. - Hey, Donna, is Elizabeth there? - Oh, good morning, Jake. I think she's awake... she must be around here somewhere. Let me try and fi... it's for you. - Hey, you. - Hello, sweetheart. Look, I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna be able to make that photographer appointment this morning. - Uh... Is... okay. Is everything all right? - No, everything's fine, but my dad just wants to show me this building he's thinking of purchasing. You mind going on your own? - I would like for you to be there, but if you can't, I can do it by myself. - That's my girl. Okay. I'll see you when I get back. - What now? - Jake has to go meet his dad, so I get to go to the photographer by myself. - Want me to go with you? - No. I'm okay. Thank you. - Pretty please? - No. Let me read you your horoscope instead. - Oh, please. - Leo. - Good morning. - Good morning. Um... I was coming to actually tell you that I'm leaving to go meet with the wedding photographer. I'll be back in a little bit, though. - That's good, 'cause your mom asked me to clean some stuff out in the garage, so... - She did? That's nice of you. Thank you. - Oh, not a problem. All right, I'll see you later. - Yeah. - Awesome. - Yeah. Oh, my God. - Hey, douche bag, you and me gotta talk, bro. - What is your problem now? - What'd you tell her, man? - I see the ankle healed up nice. - Screw my ankle, all right? What did you tell her? - I didn't tell her anything, okay? 'Cause it would devastate her. - Give me a break. You expect me to believe that? After what I saw last night? - Last night? There was nothing to see. - I saw you! I was right over there! She kissed you! And you kissed her back. You love her, man! You've always loved her. Elizabeth made her choice, okay? And whether I like it or not, I'm not gonna do anything to screw up her life. - Well, guess what, jerk off? That's exactly what you're doing. Now, I'm gonna be back in an hour. Make up any bogus excuse you want, but when I get back, your bags better be packed and you better be headed back to Boston. Got it? Whoa! Buddy! It's okay, buddy. - Oh... - Help me get him in the car. - Uh... No. No. - Where you going? Jake, help me get buddy in the car! - What... - Okay, buddy. It's okay, I'm here. One, two, three. Okay, bud. Okay, I got you. I got you. Donna. Donna, get the car! - Dr. Dana Burke, please dial extension 202. Dr. Burke, please dial extension 202. - Oh, honey, honey, honey. Honey. I'm so glad you're here. - Is buddy okay? - Mitch is back there with the doctor right now. - I've called Jake a hundred times. He's not answering his phone. Mitch! - Listen, it's gonna be okay. - Oh, my God, your shirt. - It's okay, all right? The doctors are with him right now. He's gonna be out in a second to let us know what's going on. - How is he? - Well, we were able to stop the bleeding and repair the damage to the leg and the abdomen. - Is he gonna be okay? - It looks very good. He'll have a full recovery. - Thank you. - Thank Mitch. It was Mitch's quick action that saved buddy's life. - Thank you. - Can we see him? - Sure. Just remember, he's a little out of it. He hasn't been moved to recovery yet, but I'm sure he'd like to see his mom and dad. - Oh, Mitch isn't his dad. He's a friend visiting in town. - Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt you, but I have some paperwork that needs filling out. - No problem. You two go. - Thank you, mom. - I'll take care of this. - I'm just gonna give you guys a couple minutes, then we have to move him. - You okay? You wanna be alone? - No. Hey... - I'm just glad he's gonna be all right. - Me too. - Yeah. Oh, honey. Oh... thank you, Mitch. Thank you so much. Okay. I'll see you both at home. - Drive safe, mom. - Okay. - I'm just happy he's coming home in a few days. That's great. - It's Jake. I don't want to deal with that right now. You wanna go get something to eat? - You know, I know my timing kinda sucks right now, but, um... I think I'm gonna go. - Oh, okay. Um... See you at the house. - No. I mean I'm gonna leave. - Like for good? Mitch, we still have the wedding. I need you there. - You don't need me there. - Yes, I do. - Why? Why do you need me there? It's your wedding, for Christ's sake. - You never really talked to me like that before. And you know what, Mitch? You're right. Your timing could not be worse. - Why is it so important that I be at your wedding, huh? You wanna rub it in my face? - Rub it in your face? What are you talking about? - God, jeez... Jake is right. I am a wuss. You might as well just make me the maid of honor. - What does that mean? - You don't get it, do you? - Get what? - I'm in love with you. - Why would you tell me that? - I've wanted to tell you that since the first time I met you. Do you know why I came to find you? Do you remember what we said to each other? The day before graduation. Ten years ago. - Tell me. Mitch, tell me. - Take care of yourself. - Hey. Donna filled me in. Are you okay? - No. - I know you just wanna save me how bad I wanna let you 'cause there's so much I wanna be and I don't wanna regret you but I miss you when you're gone I wanted this so very long and I feel a breakdown coming on - Hi. Is this Rudy? - I'm losing it, I gotta let you go while I go through this I'm losing it, don't wanna say good-bye but I can't do this I'm losing it, I know it's time I tried it all I loved and I won and still I fall but I'm finally losing it so hard waking up alone and chasing my dreams it's so far to walk this road with no guarantees and never know that every song reminds me of you being gone and I feel a breakdown coming on I'm losing it, I gotta let you go while I go through this I'm losing it, don't wanna say good-bye but I can't do this I'm losing it, I know it's time I tried it all I loved and I won and still I fall but I'm finally losing it oh, when I'm out of town and you're not around I'll be breaking down I'm breaking down - I'm looking at the same numbers. But, well, no, I can assure you, it's all tax deductible. It is. Let's go through last month's projected and actually see where we came out. I think you're gonna be very happy. - I'm losing it, I'm losing it I'm losing it, I'm losing it I'm losing it I gotta let you go while I go through this I'm losing it, don't wanna say good-bye but I can't do this I'm losing it honey, I don't wanna put you through this I'm losing it, baby, please don't cry but I can't do this I'm losing it oh, oh, no I'm losing it oh oh I'm losing it I know it's time, I tried it all I loved and I won and still I fall but I'm finally losing it I'm losing it. - You look beautiful. Your father would be so... Proud today. - Yeah? - Yeah. Elizabeth... You need to stop. Mitch isn't coming. - I know. I just can't stop thinking about him. It's my wedding day, and all I think about is Mitch. - It may sound strange, but I keep thinking about him too. - Mother! - What? He's a nice republican. - He's actually a registered independent. - On the outside. Not in here. - I miss him. - Is she here? - You're not supposed to be here. - Donna, I'm gonna be married to this woman in about 30 minutes. I think it's okay if I see her now, okay? - No, no. Not until she walks down that aisle. - Fine. Fine. You haven't seen Mitch around, have you? - No. He isn't here. - Good. 'Cause the next time I see him, I'm gonna put him in the hospital... you got it? - Will you stop with that? He's the one who saved buddy after you hit him and took off. Besides... They made a pact ten years ago to marry each other only for him to find out that she's marrying you instead. So I think I'd cut him a little slack, honey. - They made a pact? Gosh, Donna, I don't know what to say. That's so touching. Come on, are you kidding me? Who the hell even does that? And that whole buddy thing, by the way? I was trying to protect my family's reputation. - Go back to your friends, Jake. We'll see you downstairs. - Yeah, I'll see you downstairs. - Everything okay? - Everything's fine. It's terrific. So... You ready to get married? - How's dad? Well, look, I'm gonna see you guys Sunday anyway, okay? Yes, I'm still coming for dinner. Okay? I love you too. All right, bye. Buddy? Buddy! Ha ha ha! Is that you? You look great? - I was about to say the same thing about you. Looks like someone took up jogging. - What are you doing here? - I just thought that you'd like to see that buddy was doing okay. - So you came all the way to Boston to tell me buddy's okay. - No, actually, I came all the way to Boston to show you that buddy was okay. - Why would you do that? - Well... - Will you stop with that? He's the one who saved buddy after you hit him and took off. Besides... They made a pact ten years ago to marry each other, only for him to find out that she's marrying you instead. - Everything okay? - Everything's fine. It's terrific. So... You ready to get married? - Sorry. - Whoa, compadre. Where do you think you're going? - Who the hell are you? Get your hands off me! Ow! Ow! - Now, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this my way. It's your choice. - Mother... ow! Ow! - Okay. It's my way. Let's go. - Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? I'm sorry to inform you, but there will no longer be a wedding here today. It seems that the bride to be has had a change of heart. And as I look around this beautiful setting, it seems none of you are shocked. - Excuse me, but you're hurting my son. - Yes, I am. - Would you please stop? - Where's Donna? No worries. Elizabeth called me. Jake, it's over. Don't come looking for Elizabeth... ever. If you do, you're not gonna find her... you're gonna find me. And I'm from Texas. That means I'll barbecue his ass! Oh! - Y... - no. Learn to leave on a high note. - You gonna be okay? - I'll be fine. Take care of her. - Will do. - Thank you. - Good night, everybody. - You know what, guys? I'm gonna go catch the laker game. - You don't have to worry about him anymore. Ha ha ha! So where we heading? - Boston. - Ha ha! Beantown. Sweet! - Hey, baby, we just picked her up. We're on our way. - Hold on, girls. - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo! - Yee-haw! - And we didn't stop until we got here. - Why would you do that? - I needed to see you. I wanted to make things right between us. - Well... You saw me. You... buddy looks great. - Mitch, wait. It was the day of graduation, and you were talking to Dave and I went over to steal you. I told you what a special friend you were to me... And if I have a regret it's that I never gave you a chance. I never gave us a chance. So here I am asking for a chance. Mitch Becker, will you do me the honor of fulfilling a promise that I made to you? Will you marry me? I love you, and I wanna spend the rest... - wait, stop. I must have gone over this moment a thousand times in my head and... Never once did I ever imagine it was going to be you proposing to me. You're the love of my life. Course I'm gonna marry you. Wait, wait. One condition. We don't... we don't wait. We do this. No engagement. No ceremony. No photographers. We just... We do this right now. We go down to city hall and do it... what do you say? Deal? - I think I can do one better. - It's such a long way back to you Hey, it's me. Hold on, I'm gonna put you on speaker. Okay, you're on. - What's up, my brother? - Rudy! - Hey, Mitch, what's happening? - Oh, my gosh, Laura, how are... is Dave with you? - He sure is. - And I'm with her. Ha ha ha! So, man, any news. - Well, I think we need pastor Rudy. We're getting married. - Oh, congratulations. - There you go, my man. All right! - Wait, wait. Rudy's a pastor? - Hell, yeah. Online, baby. You can get a license or anything. - How soon can you be here? We wanna do it today. - Uh, half an hour? - Okay, we'll see you soon. You know, they did say that we had 30 minutes. - Yes, they did. Well, to quote my friend Dave, I did not predict that. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's... - oh, wait, wait, wait. Buddy! - I'm sorry. Where was I? Ah, forget it. I'm getting married!
