Also heard that. That Muslims want to push Jews back to the sea. Over a billion and a half of Muslims worldwide, in different countries, with different languages, with different modes to see the world. And there will always be people I hate other people.

It is another genius, received two diplomas at one time. Was with him in the camp of summer when he broke his leg. It was the first accident that happened in the camp, and ended putting handrails in all places, hiking, but because of insurance. We ... No, I'm very tired. - Please. - Okay. Care.

I was thinking about that Ms. Jacoby said. Yeah, me too. It was not legal, it was totally ... ignorant ... It was arrogant. Who she thinks she is? Should have more account, in her position. Bright. We could trigger it, you Check? We could, but educate them a little. This will leave to you. Look around and we and see what they chose. And then I would read the word in your chest and say why the choice. Eddie? Can begin. I chose 'boricua' because it is what I am port Rican, and I'm proud of it. I like music, dance, taste of barbecue in the park. You represent that, I 'boricua'. Very well. Do you think we can include Eddie in our wheel? We feel well and a 'boricua' us? Yes, very well. The next. Rebecca. I chose 'potential' because my grandmother told me before he died that I can be everything I want. Very nice. How do you feel having someone with potential in our group? Okay. Great. Justin. - No! - No! Silence. Why not tell us what is the his word and that the chosen? It is what it means, 'smelly'. - What it means for you? - What does it mean to you? Justin, I'm warning you ... The question is how we feel having someone 'smelly' in our group. What do you think? No. No. No. Okay. We must vote. All that are opposed, raise your hand. Okay, not Justin can stay in our wheel. Is excluded. Justin, sit down. Wait, how can you expel it so? Not fair! But we who chose are our friends, right? Who we want in our wheels, and when last week thought Miss Nasira and I could not be friends, because she is Muslim and I'm Jewish. We all have our traits, our features. Our words in our breasts. But it results in choice, an individual choice on who will stay with us. And chose to say. If he chose another word, could return, no? Maybe. We would have to vote for and depend on the new floor. We will choose another word and go back to the wheel. Rochela. What? Not in time. - Why not? - Avi. I remind you that ... just want to see the best of you in the coming weeks. His face, his skin pink. I just want to have the best appearance, only that. - Well skinny. - Stop, Avi. Stop the two. Dad, can I withdraw? Yes you can. She has to care for the appearance.

The neighbors can see it. - The neighbors are gossipy. - Exactly. This is what I mean. We work together, is a friend from school, just that. Well Should ask her to go and talk with his father, before he arrives. I would not say that, but could undermine his chances. This is ridiculous. Perhaps it. But could, yes, sorry. Talk to your father. She does not feel at ease with my presence, is not it? We should make a wheel of debate in the kitchen? Sorry. I am so ashamed. Is not, see you tomorrow. Who was it? His mother is at home? Mom! Nina is here to talk of reducing my chances! - Who was she? - Nobody. What is it? Has nothing. Whether eat or drink anything? A cup of tea would not be bad. Yes, Nasira? - You talked to mom? - Yes And then? You must leave of looking at physical appearance. Perhaps there are virtues in Bathit. Not only that, Dad. We have nothing in common.
