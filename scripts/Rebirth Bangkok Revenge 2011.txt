I'm not going to do anything. No, no! Please, don't kill me! Shh! All right. Good boy. Everything is going to be okay. The bullet is lodged behind the frontal lobe. It's impossible to remove it without damaging the rest of the brain. He won't survive more than 48 hours. Let nature take its course. It's a miracle he's made it this far. The shell misfired. Otherwise the bullet would have blown his brains out. Has his family been notified? All dead. He'll join them soon. Probably best. Hey! You seen that new nurse? Tasty! $500 says I get there before you do! Okay, you're on! Don't worry. I'm here. Hang in there. You need to fight. Fight. Superintendent! Do you have any leads on the killers? The inquiry is in hand. What exactly were they working on? - That's classified. - Superintendent! Do you have any leads on the murder of Inspector Samat and his family? Pain in my ass. What's the news on Samat's kid? He's still in a coma. Make sure he's not left alone. Understood. Go ahead. You can't come in here. This is intensive care. His parents didn't want him on life support. You have to turn it off. You sure this is official? Do I look like I'm not an official? Hold on! Give the kid a break! Science has made so much progress and miracles still happen. Tell him, Doctor. If you turn it off, will he live? No way. Right. Go ahead. I'll take the responsibility. You can't do this. You'll kill him! It's murder. Turn it off. That's an order. It's murder! No! Don't touch me! What does this mean? I told you! He's alive. It's incredible! There's been a development. Nurse. Here is my card, call me if you have any news about the boy. Yes, it is bad news. Yes, exactly. Don't worry, little one. I'm here. Hello. What the hell has happened? Where's the kid? You are a bunch of incompetent idiots! Why didn't you warn me? Adjan! - It's very bad. - His spirit is with us... but he is between two worlds. So that's the story. Don't you think I'm a bit old to play nurse? They're going to kill him. Judging by his current condition, they wouldn't have to try very hard. Adjan, careful! I'm sure he can hear us. The truth will cure him. You know the secrets of the plants. Only you can save him. I will never ask anything of you. If you won't do it for him... do it for me? Then I get to go on holiday. Thank you very much! Long live holiday. Know your past to build your future. Know your body to open your spirit. Nothing's changed? He has ataraxic. His brain has been damaged. He doesn't feel anything anymore. No happiness... no pain. Go on! Ohh! You are about as fast as a turtle and as powerful as a koala. Training is not knowledge. Knowledge is not power. Combine training with the knowledge you shall achieve the power. My art has become your art. This evening I'll teach you the ultimate technique, the way which leads to death. This you must use only if your life is in danger. Hey, a beer! Tea for two. Lesson 956: A good fighter must know how to receive like a buffalo. Lesson 957: He must dodge like a mongoose. And lesson 958: Strike like a tiger. When you fight, you must neither dodge nor reply until I tell you. We will start with lesson 956. Okay, who will I fight? Adjan, they haven't done anything to me. They will. What? What did you say? That they are all sons of bitches? Lesson 956. What did you say?! Think about the buffalo. And lesson 957. Lesson 958. And our teas? I think I prefer 958. Master Adjan? Yes? Chanticha is sick. She wants to see Manit. Hello, Mom. Manit, we have to talk. I am sick, my little one. I will die soon. I know that you understand but you feel nothing. This is not your fault. I will explain. You have to know that your father was a renowned lieutenant. He was investigating a vast network of corruption within the police force. But he didn't have the support of his hierarchy. He was starting to disturb way too many people. One evening, they decided to erase them. They murdered all his colleagues. One by one, carefully. Then they went to your house. Who did this? The investigation never found the culprits... but for all these years I have continued to search. Look in there. Everything I have discovered is in there. Press articles, pictures, witnesses. I did what I could to save you. I can no longer protect you. I am so tired, Manit. Don't worry, Mother. I'm ready. Hello. I work as a nurse at the General Hospital. You asked me to inform you if I ever had any information about the little boy who disappeared years ago, do you remember? Well, I know where he is. You know him? Nope, never seen him before. Can't say he looks sad. - Reckon it's him? - How the hell would I know? The only photo I've seen was when he was a kid. Call the boss! Sir... it's me. Yes... he just walked past the car. Yeah... just like that. I can't say, really. Looks like a peasant. Okay. We will see if we can. And? We have to check if he has a scar on his left temple. If so, we take him to the boss. Okay, let's go. Where is he? Hey, come here. Did you see this guy? Sure? I'll be back. Well, we had a deal. You promised me an interview. Yeah, yeah, we promised you an interview. We keep our words right? But it's just that we need to drag it out a little bit, you know? - It's not that easy. - Okay, come on, Clara, let's... Hey, where the fuck you think you're going, man? Take it easy, okay? How much more do you want? All you gotta do is give us a blowjob, for each and every one of us. We'll tell you the greatest story you need to know. - Yeah. - Sounds good? And by the way, pretty boy, we've got something for you too. Stop it! No, no! Stop it! Stop it! Leave him! Stop it! Stop it! Leave him! Leave him! Aah! What's going on over here? Who the fuck are you? Manit. Your friend's kind of strange. Who the fuck is this fool, man? Lamon, get this fool, man. Beat him up! You wanted to speak with him? Yeah. Hey! Girl wants to talk with you. All right. These young people, they've got nothing in their lives. Okay. They must be suffering! I'm not sure about before, but definitely now. How can you do things like that to human beings? First you have to study anatomy, then it's just a matter of training. Okay. Guys, I'm out of here. - Thanks again, Manit. - Will I see you tomorrow? Yeah, okay. See you. You have somewhere to sleep? No. You could crash at my place if you like. I've got a couch. - Which way? - This way. You don't know me. My instinct never fails me. Right. Sometimes people are who they seem to be. How come that you speak English so well? If I told you, you'd never believe me. Um, shower's through there. It's a nice place. Interesting? I'm a journalist. Thought you were honest. Do you have an explanation for these? I would have taken their ears, but I didn't have a knife. They were following me. I didn't know they were cops. Hey! Hey! Girls, where are you going? Come here! Come here! Do you know this guy? Never seen him! Hey! Wow. You snore quite loud for a girl! I didn't snore! You have a dog? I don't have a dog! Well, then, I guess you snore. Cheeky! Whoo! Sneaky? No. Okay, forget it. Actually, I've been looking through your friend's file... Those are my mother's files. Mother? Okay, whatever. Your mother, she did a very good detective job, but there are more questions than answers. Well, that's why I'm here. I'm trying to find all the answers. I can help you. We found him. He's with a journalist who investigates gangs. Well... I think we'll have to intervene. Alors? Comment jetais? Une pure merveille... Comme d'habitude. How was I? Marvelous as ever, my beauty. The first show in ten days. I'm so nervous! Because you're talented! You're so nice and I want to say again how grateful I am that you are producing this concert. I'm retired. I've got a wife who sings like an angel, and I have the means. Is it true? You don't feel any emotions? Sometimes I get a bit hungry. Smart ass. I read the medical report. Oh, yeah? Sometimes I think it might be something of an advantage. You know? It's a shortcut. Shortcut, huh? Police. Come with us. I'm not moving an inch. I'm a journalist. This is an illegal arrest. I know my rights. Lache moi! Manit! Lache moi! Manit! Manit! Where did they take the girl? - Fuck you. - That's not very nice. Aah! What? Eighth district, special force. District, special force. Well, I'm gonna have to give them a special visit then, aren't I? Thank you. MEDICAL CENTER Almost missed it. Same floor. Where's the girl? I like you, all right? Don't make me hurt you. Where? Where? Okay, open the door. Open the door! Thank you. Nice pants. So where's the girl? Fuck the girl! Whoever you are, help me! Help me! Who are you? Depends. I'm a cop. That's not a very good reference. Wait, wait! I'm not like them. I've been after these guys for months. Those guys are working for the mob. It's a real organization, and I almost had their leader. - I can show them to you. - Go on. My father was onto them 20 years ago. He had all their files. I can show you. Holy shit! You don't fool around, do you? - Not for the last 20 years. - Never seen that before. Well, I've never done it before. Here, come on. I'll show you the files. He was my father. Butchered like a dog. His throat was cut off, and the bastard cut off his tongue. He was sent as an undercover by his section chief, and I swear, I will continue his fight. Cool. Can you look up Samat? Samat? Samat. Wait, isn't this your...? Yes, my father. Holy shit! Just imagine: Your father and mine, and now me and you...! Look, I've set you free, and that's great. But I've got to finish what I've started. Call some of your friends, get them to do a clean-up over here. - I'm gonna go find this girl. - Wait, wait. The girl? - Yeah. - I heard they were handing her to the Hyenas. It's a girl gang. The cops let them handle all their dirty works. - Where I can find them? - I'll show them to you. You'll get lost. I found you okay, didn't I? Leave it to me. I can use their methods. Okay. Cool. Come here, I'll show you. They should be here. Come. Come with me, girls. Hey, guys, what did you get? Here we go! Ooh, gosh. You know what happened? He beat the crap out of them... Excuse me, sir, do you know the Khlong Toei neighborhood? Excuse me, sir, do you know the Khlong Toei neighborhood? - Yes. - Could you tell me how to get there? Out of the question. I don't want your death on my conscience. Come on in, come on in! We have the best boxing! Excuse me. What do you want? - I have a friend... - Your friend is in here? Yes! I hope it's not the fat guy. This is for white guys. You see the fat guy with his gang? He thinks he is Mike Tyson! He is here because he hopes to knock someone out. As if he was at Lumpinee Stadium. It's going to cost him some money, but he is ready to pay the price. Just as long as he feels strong and feels like a champion. They all dream of being Thai boxers. And you find guys ready to take it, just like that? Same guy around four years. Yeah! Yeah! Thrown down! I told him! I told him! You're nothing! You're nothing! You got nothin' on me! Yeah! Do you know where the Khlong Toei neighborhood is? Hey, he wants to go to Khlong Toei. Well... if he wants to get beaten up, let him go. You're not from around here. Neither are you. The way you look, you'll get the shit kicked out of you. I'm looking for somebody! - Forget it! - Like you do with alcohol? You really want to go there? Yeah. You really want to quit drinking? Fifty bahts and I'll take you. Thirty. Forty. Deal! You don't say much, huh? No. Okay. Carry on for 500 meters, and you'll know you're there. You owe me 40 bahts. Stop playing and do your homework! I don't want to, Mom! - It's amazing! - Oh, my God! You should see that, you know? It's so fun! Hey! Go, go, go! Stop, stop! Hey, you want some, bitch? That's not very nice. Let her go! Come and get her. She's useless. What? Can I ask you something? What? Asshole! # Ave # Maria # Ave # Maria Shit! Allo? I am working! When? Okay, start without me. I'll be there in a minute. Any problem? Not really. Just... just business. We'll start again in two hours, okay? Okay. - You heard? - I was on the extension. You really can't help it, can you? Professional instincts, I guess. Be careful. Of course. Ohh. Is she dead? Sounds like you're talking about a sandwich. You're real funny, you! Uh! Don't even think about it. You're checking? I'm checking. That must hurt... but not enough! Hi, boss! Hi, girls. So where are we? We got both the little shits. - What the hell? - Uh... We didn't have any ropes, so we tied him with our panties! That's what I love about you all. You've got the initiative of real bad bitches. You, back to sleep. Look at his left temple. Is there a scar? Yeah, he got a scar. - He's our man. - All right, enough talk. Kill them both. Not like that. Too quick and too noisy! Get him! Die, bastard! - Fuck! - Let's go! Manit! My God. Manit. Manit! Oh, my God! - Manit! - Ow. - You're suffocating me. - Good, you're alive. I must be, because I can feel you suffocating me. Oh, please forgive me for taking care of you. It's weird. You know, I-I think I know their leader. She's called Jessy Yiouchenko. She's... she's an opera singer. She must have more strings to her bow. Call the downtown police station. Ask to speak to Anada. You can give him my name. Tell him what happened here and ask him to check out this singer. She hurt my ass. - Now what? - Your place is under surveillance... so I carry on and stay here. No way! I'm coming with you. You need my help. It's out of the question that I hang around and do nothing without... What did you say? Okay, it's cool. You can come with me. That's it? Normally a gentleman would have found a thousand reasons that I don't put my life at risk. You just say yes, and that's it? Why don't we take a rest? I feel a bit tired. I thought we were going to finish the investigation. I feel tired, so I'm going to have a rest. I'm not tired. Well, you were asleep for the whole fight, so you've had your rest. I was not asleep. I was faking it. And why did you say that I was used for nothing? Guess I was faking it, or something like that. - You coming? - Yeah, I'm coming. What are you doing? I'm comforting you. I think you had a nightmare. You know I have to feel sad in order to be comforted, right? I know you're never sad. It must be terrible never to feel anything. I don't know, maybe it's better that way. In France, I know a famous neurologist, he's really good. I'm sure he could do something for you. Since your accident, there has been enormous progress. - That way you could be... - Normal? - That's not what I meant. - Don't worry about it. I never feel sad, remember? And tenderness? Did you ever take a woman in your arms and... I can do that. Sleep well? Enough. Well, I've been thinking... maybe it would be better if you continued on your own way. Okay. Will you show me to this place? You know what? Take a fucking taxi, smart ass! - Okay. - Okay? And Clara... about last night... thanks for that. It was cool. Yeah, Inspector Anada? Yes, this is Clara. Manit has been kidnaped. I'm waiting for you. Five minutes. Okay. This is where you'll die. But first, a couple of questions. Answer them, and we won't make you suffer. Can I die somewhere else? What? It's ugly here. Somewhere nicer. What is he saying? No! This is a good place! Oh, my God. I think I've fallen into the hands of the most tasteless killers in Bangkok. Shut the fuck up, man! Now you're gonna tell us what the fuck are you doing over here, man! Just this. Aah! Aw, shit, man! Are you guys cops or something? No! Fuck off, man. Uh... wrong answer. - Are you a cop? - Yeah. Come on. From the 8th? Eighth district? No man! Shit! You're gonna take me to your boss, or you'll never walk again. How, man? Aah! Aah! Aah! Shit! You broke my arm! Shit, man! It's all right, it's an automatic. You don't need both hands. You are not gonna win this, you know. This is too big for you. You're gonna end up blown away. Shit! Shut up and drive. We have to be quick. We must find him. I already put the car details on the wire, but if you really want me to help you, you need to tell me more. I've only known him for three days. You are a journalist. You sense things? No? Al I have is a file that his mother left him before she died. It contains documents that could incriminate corrupt cops concerning the murder of his parents. Now that is interesting. Where is it? At my place. But there must be police officers! Look, you trust me, so let's go get it. Okay. These guys are screwing up the whole goddam system. They must be found and eliminated. I want to talk to Jessy. Nobody talks to the boss. I do not speak to the flunky. Aaahhh! Anything else? I work alone. Alone? Who the hell do you think has been selling your shit for the last two last years? And that goes for all of you! Thanks to Jessy, you are comfortably rich. Without her network, what do you think you'd be able to export? Ten kilos? With her, you've got five tons a year out there! What's the plan? Tell your men. Find them and kill them. Jessy wants their heads on her desk in 48 hours. If you want your money, the concert is still on. You like classical music, do you? Not a lot. Who's this girl singing here? She's quite good. I don't know, man. What's your first name? Why? I don't know. Just to establish a sort of friendship. I'm Manit. Sanouk! Well, Sanouk, my friend, you think I'm an idiot, don't you? Let's start again. The lady singing on the CD. Do you know who she is? That's Jessy Yiouchenko or something, man. Go on. If I talk, I'm dead, man. And if you don't you think you're gonna get married? Okay. She runs a network of heroin trafficking between Thailand and South America. How? Thanks to the concerts. The shit goes with the orchestra. As she's famous and the show's run by the embassies mostly, there are no custom checks, you know. And who's above her? I don't know! Well, more pain is on its way, I'm afraid. Hey! Come quick! We are after him! We're coming! Oh, damn, that feels good! What's going on? Get off! Hey! I need your head! And I need your balls! Get him! Get him now! Freeze. Put your gun down. Put your gun down! Gotcha. Okay. It's done. We've got them. I am asking you, what do they want from you? Do you understand me? You won't get away with causing all this trouble. Do you know we've been watching you? Do you know... if I'd known, I would have brushed my hair. Why do you speak in English? If I told you, you would never believe me. Okay, English is fine. But you'd better talk to me. If you want protection, just come up with something. - So... trust me. - Well, I don't want protection... and trust has to be earned, not demanded. - True, but you're still in deep shit, anyway. - So are you. You have to clean out your own stable first. I'm the head of an anti-corruption brigade, and I'm fighting with all my strength to uncover and punish those who contaminate the force. Because of what? They insult the country. My father said the same thing. And he died for it, along with the rest of the members of his section. You wanna know why I'm here? Not for revenge, but for justice. Fine. If you want to follow your role, just do it. And you know what? If anything goes wrong, I'll arrest you like the rest, even if you're Samat's son. Uh, to each his duty. And what about Simon? He'll be busted. So... Mr. Simon Weber. No one's called me like that since a long time. Or should I call you ex-French detective Inspector Weber? You can call me whatever you want. I really don't give a shit. I have an Interpol warrant for your arrest. Don't you have a whisky also, by any chance? Your friends accused you of having stolen from drug traffickers. With ice? Personally, I have nothing up against you, but you betrayed your oath. If I betrayed somebody, it was me. Huh? - Just me. - How 'bout your wife? Died. Sorry. Why? Did you kill her? Smoking kills. Hm. Assholes, too. You want me to get you out? Oh. No, I have lots of questions. I think the answers might be here. Thanks for your help. I don't like injustice, for anyone, and I think you're special. I like people who are different. Okay, I'm out of here. Hey! Hm? I don't think you can kill pain with more pain. Yeah. Hey, Manit. Anada. Clara and I have been looking for you everywhere. Well, you found me. Come on, I'll get you out of here. Let's go get Clara. And what about Inspector Pitcher? Don't worry. I already talked to him. - Come on, let's go. - Cool. Clara just called. She said she found out some really interesting things about your family... something that could explain everything. - This will all be over soon. - It's not over yet. - You recognize this? - Yeah! Come on, let's go in. When your father was killed, his colleague did this for him to pay his respect. You think can you get in? I was able to get out! - Clara. - Get in! - Is that a gun? - Get in! Hey, Clara, how you doing? You all right? This is my friend Anada. You wouldn't want another one, would you? Who knows? It might cure you. I was the one who screwed you on District 8. Anada, enough! You can never be too careful. You prefer English. Why is that? 'Cause you're Thai, like us. If I told you, you'd never believe me. Allow me to make the introductions. Is that necessary? I am Sanya Wurapong. I was your father's superior. I think it's nice for you to get to know the person who made your life this way. Shall I take a seat? I feel this is going to be rather long and very complicated. I like your sense of humor. Permit me to tell you a little story. Once upon a time, there was this young inspector whose boss sent him to work with us undercover. He was unmasked, questioned, and convinced to work with us... so much so that we could lead his boss to believe that he was dead. Not too difficult to find a replacement. I think you know the rest, and now you come back and stick your nose into our business affair. You know, you're just like your father before he turned vigilante. He was doing his duty. My father sacrificed his life because of you! Well, being a traitor must be a genetic condition. Hey, cool it! I'm sure you understand you can't leave here alive. You have to die. You're too late. I'm already dead. Memories? So far, so good. This scene won't be complete without the final touches. You ever thought about going into the movie business? Finish your job, Narai. Have fun, boys! Sorry, little boy. Aah! Aah! Aah! Sanya! Freeze. How... how do you feel? How do I feel? I feel fucking shit! I've got fucking holes in my legs! I feel bad! I feel bad! Welcome to the world of the living! Your father would be proud of you. Well, thanks for your help. Good luck. Thank you for coming to save me. It's starting to feel like a full-time job. I love you. Huh? I love you. Mister Simon! And mister Nicky! # Blood for blood, your heart runs cold # # See a fiery stove in your wanton soul # # Oh, you don't have # No feelings now # I want to love but don't know how # # 'Cause you don't have no feelings now # # I feel tears wash away # The bitter scars # Your war is won and mine's begun # # I'm all alone # Out in the cold # Chasing a dream # That won't unfold # 'Cause # You don't have no feelings now # # You don't have no feelings now # # You don't have no feelings now # # You don't have no feelings now # # You don't have no feelings now # # You don't have no feelings now # # Ohh # You don't have no feelings now # # Ohh # Feelings now # No feelings now
