Look, he even snapped one while me yawning. When I was a kid mom always dressed me up with gowns like this one, but I really hated them aaarrr... Because, there's no such thing in the history of this world a Sheriff wearing gown, right? But this one was rightly done... this is 'rock'!!!! And my overwhelming desire to become a Sheriff would never fade away until I've grown-up... Serve you right... try hitting a woman again! You know who did this? This is Delaila 'd nerd'... my best friend. She always being bullied. Alright... you know who did this En. Bidin? Who, En. Bidin? I just can't stand it seeing women being harrassed by men. That's the reason I whacked Bidin, my best friend's lover! Eventhough your intention was good to help your best friend that needed help, Nik Melati Sukma Nik Mat... Even if En. Bidin retrieved his report, you are still gonna face the music. Good morning... Nik melati Sukma? I came to assess the progress of your mental and emotion after you finished the 2 weeks of therapy period. Very well Miss Melati Sukma. How do you feel when you have been sentenced to clean toilets for violating the 3rd principle of the therapy? My feeling? Yes please. You want to know how I feel? Ouchh ouchh so brutal... ouchh! This is how I feel! Hmmm... I'm in love????!!! I would easily got mad whenever I asked people to call me as Nikki and not... Nik Melatisukma! I really hate that name, it does not reflect the sheriffness in me at all cause... Nik Melatisukma! Mom and dad have finally arrived to a conclusion for your future undertaking. After you finished studying at this new college, Nikki must enroll into a grooming class... It's very important you know. Look at me today! If the grooming class does not help, dad has a better idea... And I can assure you that dad's idea is the most effective way to neutralise your brutal attitude Nikki... Who say I'm brutal! I'm wearing flowers you see! Nik melati Sukma, listen first. My dear, please continue. I want you Nikki to get married. Like it or not, its final - no more life line! Nik Melatisukma. I think you better get married... right dear? Even the representative of the groom's family will be coming the day after tomorrow for the enticement and engagement... That is the ultimatum from my father and mother as a result of me being involved in those problems ever since I know the meaning of life... Selberan 0.32 carat dear... and in Precision cuts! How was it Dato'? Agreeable? We should ask the person first! Through the history of my life it was recorded that Ayub was the first person to send proposition to me and my family... I don't want! I don't want! So what is wrong with Ayub? He is young, handsome like your dad and composed... ...and he is your counselor right? What your dad had just said is true Melatisukma. Good opportunity comes only once. I do agree if Melatisukma were to marry Ayub. I'm too young! I'm just 19 year old! I do not want to get married yet... I don't want! I don't want! I don't want! What do you think of my hair, ok? Do you know that, so many girls would love to hang out with me? Now this opportunity should be considered as your good luck! I have an appointment with Dr Ryan Diprojo Hello, one moment ye! Are you Nik Melati Sukma? Hah?!!! Nik Melati Sukma are you? Yes! Is Dr in? He is. But he should be out by now. Why is he still not getting out... Heh! Why staring at me? You hair style. Where did you do it? Heh! I did not do it anywhere... Born with it... Inherit my mom's, so nosy! Nik Melati Sukma? If all Psychologist have good looking like him, everybody would love to be crazy. Do you know the reasons why you are referred to me? Yes. Because I love you doctor. What I mean is I love my mother... I love my father... my grandmother... and my grandfather too! Previously, can you describe what makes you easily get angry? Is it wrong for me to be angry like that? I'm getting married To Omar? No... I broke off with Omar. Why? Omar is nice right? Too nice a person! Certainly he is a nice person. But he, is not as romantic as the other person that I've chosen. Soon I'll get married, once gotten the Diploma. And after that, I will stop studying. And I hope to be a fulltime housewife. After I date him, then I will make my decision! Do you know that he told me that my voice is horrible! Never mind, you wait and see, the time when we sing together! Eh! You have no appointment today Miss? Hah?! Miss Melati has no appointment today? I know that but I have a few questions to ask Miss Mulan. But only if Miss Mulan wants to help. Help? Tell me what? Alah a bit shy... I want to know everything about Dr Ryan Diprojo. What he likes... his favourite food... His hobby... bla bla bla! And the most important thing is, is he married? Not yet Is it? Yes he has no girlfriend. Hah?! Girlfriend... he has no one! It is true, they say... Every thing happens there is wisdom. Because of the beatings on Bidin, I met my mate... And according to the guidebooks to search for a mate that I read, one way to tie a man is through his stomach... Although I never touched the pan, let alone slicing onions... I would cook spaghetti for Dr. Ryan Diprojo to prove my love... Hmm... nice one. Nikki, it has been 3 months since your first visit... I think your performance is gradually getting better ya... I would recommend that you do not have to come here again. Which means that, I cannot see you anymore? Because I am not your patient any longer? Officially it's yes. Why? Doctor, I actually have somethings to tell you... But I hesitate to express my feeling... Ah Nikki, you are my patient for more than ten weeks... Anything you want to say, just say it out... Come on, don't be shy... Anything you want to convey, just say it... I know you since you were temperamental, until you're more calmed now... Nikki, what is that you want to say? Nikki, why? Doctor! Hi Nikki, have a seat... finished your final assignment? Finished... here is! Me, Nikki the brutal... ...has fallen in love with a 54 year old lecturer... ...same age as my dad! And with my killer wink... ...the beautiful and sacred relationship shall begin ...and I know, he is my destiny. I know that I am really Ionely after my wife passed away 5 years ago... ...but honestly I still want to ask you Nikki... Are you really sure with your decision to marry me, an old widow? What do you mean, you are not old at all! Please trust me; I had never been such confident in my entire life. What about your parents? My parents... peanuts! This is the way to peel an apple. Nik Melati Sukma! Melati Sukma, what is his name? Why not even a hint? I wanted it to be a surprise when he is here... It has been a long time Nik, how are you? Alhamdulillah... Praise to Allah... where are you lecturing now? At Nikki's college... Hasn't Nikki told you that I'm one of the lecturers? I've been there for a few years now. Well, have a seat Dr. Come! Melatisukma knows who that guy is? I know. How come we were fighting to win over Fatimah? Used to be like an ant, but now size 42! That's why... Some how rather, I just can't imagine that we are going to be in-laws? The world is so small... In-laws? Hasn't Nikki told you yet? ...that she's getting married to your son? No, only this moment I know it. Thank God, at least I know the parents... ...surprisingly an old friend's son! I know he's Dr Sheikh Muzafar, anyway why don't you, Melati tell us that you want to marry his son? I din't say that I'm going to marry his son? Hei Fatimah... stop pretending. I know you try to make me jealous in showing your romanticism with this Romeo. Remember Fatimah, you've promised to live and die with me! Hey Sheikh Muzafar! Please forgive me Sheikh Muzafar, I didn't mean to make you jealous... ...I actually had fallen in love with Nik Mat Som and we are soon ready for the engagement. Good bye Romeo... Daa! Wake up! Sheikh Muzafar! Why are you still here? Get out, I do not accept you become my son in-law now and forever. But dad, our decision is final dad... But Nikki... you don't know who he really is. In the past he was not able to marry mom... yey yey not able! Now he's turning to Nikki... Definitely there is a hidden agenda... I can't accept this... No way Nikki... I'm a widow Nik, my late wife passed away 5 years ago... I love your daughter... Is it wrong to have a matured son in-law? Cannot! My answer is definite! Cannot! Try clarifying to my daughter now, how many women happened to be your girlfriend? ...Since the time before and after you got married... and now as a widow? Nik Mat... can you just forget the past... No way, please clarify it now! I want her to hear it from your mouth... I don't care, I still want to marry Dr Sheikh Muzafar! I love him, adore him... My dear... wake up! Melatisukma, why is it up to the moment you are leaving to overseas still do not want to talk to dad... Why is it wrong to marry an old man? Dr sheikh Muzafar is not an old man, but he is an old crocodile... There's so many young men that keen to be with Melatisukma... For instant that Omar Shariff... What's wrong with Omar Shariff, make clear to me. Omar Shariff? Don't you ever feel tired of looking at mirrors? Tired? As the well-known most macho-man at the university... ...in Malaya... mirror is very important to me. Do you know how many girls have stood in line to be my girlfriend? Omar Shariff is a nice guy, but I really can't stand his self egotism and always tries to control his machoness in 24 hours... Its not that I don't like Omar Shariff mom, he is nice but... Let it be mom. For once let me just finish my study at Indiana first. Melatisukma, for your dad's sake at least, promise me that you will forget Dr Sheikh Muzafar Just because I don't want to disappoint my father and mother, I came to the agreement to forget my first love in my life... ...and I know as it will be difficult for me to forget Sheikh Muzafar, it will also tough for him to forget me... ...because he really loves me too... Today I would like to see him for the last time ...before I leave abroad to continue my studies... Nikki? What a surprise! How long has it been since we last met... 3 months? I am leaving to Indiana tomorrow... I want to say good bye and I want you to know that I... Hi Darling Hello dear Eh Nikki is here too... Excuse me Nikki... Darling, Mom just told me that 1000 pieces of wedding cards are not enough... She wants at least 3000, is that Ok darling? Make it like this, pumpkin... We will order 5000 all in all, the more the merrier right? OK darling, I will wait for you in the car. Don't take so long... I miss you... ...and you! Bye-bye At that point of time, I really wanted to forget him as easy as he's forgotten about me... Nikki... And the meet up with Omar Shariff once again on that day reminds me that I am only a woman... ...but I was too disappointed and not ready for another relationship... Now, I am 34 years old with a steady career but still single... I must say I am Ionely whereas all my friends, not including this one... ...are married with children like Delaila... Who would've thought, Delaila and Bidin who I whacked before... Are happily married with children... So, will you be here next week? We race again alright? Sis Nikki, next week I won't be able, I have to study for my exam... Boy is around... I have no exam... It's so difficult if you befriended with school children, if there's no exam then only you got the chance to play. The PMR paper is peanut... Its not easy... too many to memorize... I can help, but I want to ask you one important question... Nikki's life? In my opinion Sis Nikki, you are not ready to sacrifice your ego that so mountainous. Hah! You said I am egoistic? Eh! Eh! Mandy is only 15 years old, what do you know about life? There lots of magazines out there to read... According to one of the articles I read... ...You are the kind that afraid of commitment... Really... In a relationship, one needs to sacrifice... You Sis Nikki, are just like a little girl being in a big candy factory! Eh you spoil my hair! Too many options until you are not sure which one to choose. Sis Mandy... quick! Mama said we must be back early, we have recitation class... Ok Sis Nikki... I better make a move... But Sis Nikki, I think Omar Shariff is your match. Oh ya, I am still living with my parents... Don't get me wrong... Its not that I don't want to be independent... But I am the only child to my mom and dad, right... so I seem a bit spoiled! My dad, well... always cool as as ever. When I said cool or great is because it is not easy to live with someone like my mom Timah Ram... ...who tends to put her head in the oven every time there is a problem! Everything is Ok, Ok and Ok! Except one... ...only one that I don't like! Nikki is not 19 years old... she is now 34 years old... I am sure he will agree this time... Thank you uncle, I promise I will try my very best to soften her heart... Thank you very much Ayub... Haaa... There she is back. Hi Melati... Hi... Wow... you've changed your hair... Rebonding. Thank you. How are you? Fine. You've changed a lot... What are you doing here with my parents? Melati, I'd like to ask you out for dinner, is that OK? So how? Markonah, do you know why I love Jamil Johari or JJ so much? Why? Because he reminds me of my ex-Iover when I was studying in overseas before... John Johnny Jonathan Eh like Hindustani's song! John Johnny Jonathan... pararam pam pam pam pam! He is so... romantic, loving, cool... Is he like Beyonce? To the left, to the left. Not at all! I don't like! Who would have thought, Ayub apparently willing to wait for me until 15 years... He really loves me however... Ayob is not my taste... what to do? I deliberately doing terrible things infront of Ayub. Melati... ignore that man. He is not a good man. Alaa... You are jealous... Because I don't treat you like I treat JJ, right? Melati, I am not jealous... But frankly I know that fat jerk... Eh... How could you, simply call him fat... ...as for you, as if you look good in green shirt? Melati... Melati! JJ... how could he said you are fat! Hah! He said I am fat? Hey... no manners! Everything's perfect to JJ except... I don't know... but my feminine instinct strongly says that something is not right... When there is a call, he will dash away... And I am such person that eager to acquire the reasons... ...the nature of sheriff still firm in me! Even though I have emotion towards JJ... ...it's hard for me to say the 3 magic words. I love you! I don't know why... clueless! It is true, Miss Nikki, why would I lie to you? This information is accurate, you know? You know my sincerity... Don't trust me then look... And what I thought was right... JJ is hiding something... and I had to hold back my thick-face in getting it from Markonah, my tea lady... Markonah, you promise me What is it? Promise me you will not tell anybody about what you saw! Promise! I have to investigate further... there must be a misunderstanding... What is there to investigate? Hei... this is Markonah daughter of Martopo... I am never wrong... Have a drink... go on! Don't want? And JJ does not know that Nikki is not an ordinary person that can be easily deceived. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Hai... can you come here for a moment! Is your dad's name Jamil? Is he at home? Can you call your dad for me? Mom... Children, go inside or you will get kidnapped! Dad... somebody is looking for you! Come here... Why are you making so much noise here? The neighbours will see... its embarrassing ok? Why don't you go to the cafe... No way... No way... I want to talk right here... Ouch... ear plucked out! Why don't you go over there? I want to talk right here! Ouch, my teeth... so horror! Ouuch... like a lion! What is she doing now? Allahuakbar... my heart shifted away! Liar! I think every man named Jamil is the same as the one in Allahyarham Tan Sri P. Ramlee's movie 'Madu 3'... Itchy!!!! Why is my husband laying on the floor... what are you doing? Even if you are too tired, don't just sleep on the floor... get the pillow! What is wrong with your dad... come get up... Just because I'm still in my 100 days confinement, you rather sleep outside! Contaminated with faeces, manure... all sorts! That shoe peddler? Why? Whats wrong? Crazy... very bad manners! She wanted to sell shoes but got angry with people... no manners! Nowadays the shoe peddlers are brutal... Please don't die... I can still get pregnant! Eeee if he sell dentures and tooth paste... ...and if people do not want to buy, they brushes their teeth till the gum poke out! Are you having a stroke? Enough dear... don't sit here... Let's go in. Children, help your dad here... Go in... slowly... Don't fall... you still need to use that body long enough... The hip moves away! Pity my husband... losen out his screws! Where are you going Melati Sukma? I am going out... Be back late! I am so disappointed to be fooled by JJ. Ayob was right... JJ cannot be trusted. How could he say that he was not happy with his wife... But just see, not happy? What in the world do you call that fleet of kids! Cheh... hopeless male! And it wasn't the typical me, but that night I was very very upset... I don't understand what makes these youngsters excited by swing and sway, hip-hopping their body in disco... Men and women intermingle without limits... what are they really up to? I really can't get it! Hah look! What a hullabaloo... stiletto strikes the head? I really don't understand the current generations! I don't know which demons had possessed me... suddenly I was on the dance floor with these guys until... Oh my God... Oh my God! I've never felt insulted being treated like this... Feel some sort like a whore... Eh no! Some sort like a refugee... An illegal refugee sneaked in into Malaysia... That's how I feel. The feeling of been accused of positive drug is horrifying. All night long I kept thinking what will happen to me... I could lose my sanity if I stay a bit longer in this lock-up... Thank goodness this lady officer is kind enough to release me. If you listen to me and your mom... This would not have happened... Well mom, dad... I'm sorry ok. I didn't realized someone had planted the drugs in my drinks... Sorry uncle, aunt... This thing happened. What is important now Melati is safe and at least she was not raped... What I understand, the motive of putting drug in the drinks is to rape the victim... Luckily Ayub is a lawyer... otherwise Nikki would be remanded for another 2 weeks... you know that? Ayub, I'd like to thank you in helping me... I promise, I will never do that silly things again... ...I promise that I will change. I swear! I swear... I promise to change! After that embarasing incident, I really appreciate Ayub more than before... He is nice and cares about me... And I promised myself to learn to accept Ayub as he is... Boss, this CD is the one that you asked for. Put it there. Hi! Melati. Hi! I hope you don't mind I came to see you by surprise. No... have you had your drink yet? No worries. Are you sure? Alright then. Stretch black coffee please. Stretch black coffee! Sis Markonah... One stretch black coffee! If you don't mind only one spoon of sugar please. One spoon of sugar, sure? Yep Strech black coffee with one sugar... Sis Markonah! Strech black coffee, one spoon... only one spoon of sugar yeah! I promised myself as well as my parents that I will learn to accept Ayub to be my future husband. After all the saying goes, if our relationship is blessed by our parents, God's willing happiness up to the end. I can't bear to see me hurting my parents again... Maybe my future apparently is with Ayub... but there's something going on that really bothering me. Ayub! Melati! I love you. Not because I don't love you... I love you but, my love to you is like the love of a sister to her dear brother... ...or rather to her friend, yup that's it! Yup! Eh hang on... hang on! Although we'll end up separate ways... separate ways... We can still be friends, okey? Friends. Friends? Friends? You what? I've already spoken to Ayub... Seriously I am not marrying Ayub. Where are you going? Dad it's you! The hair-do is expensive Mah... Alahai! Melatisukma is so stupid! She rejects all the nice men... All the men that she likes are useless. Just put a stop to your seizure Mah. And get out from that oven please! I like your beautiful hair... Really suits your face Mah! If our daughter keeps behaving like this... certainly she will become an old spinster... expired my dear... Alah stop it... your hair is expensive, I really like your hair! Then who is willing to accept her with thousands wrinkles on her? It doesn't matter if she is elegant and always looks young... yet... she carries your gene... Stop it, enough! Mom... you love to dance, right? Let's dance okey? Melati... stop! Thank you! Melati Sukma must get married within this year. Understand? Where are you going? To my room... I'm bored you know? Mom and dad are so scared that me not getting married at all... Melatisukma must bring the candidate within this 21 days... Otherwise, Melatisukma has got to marry the one that we chose... understand? Alamak... so strange in the tone of mom's voice. Melatisukma? Alamak... where can I find a volunteer to fall in love with me? Oi Sarah! What's wrong with you? Okey okey... do you know that? I see you acting so weirdly these couple of days. There must be something going on... you've got to tell me! You better tell me! Ayob is nice... why did you leave him? Ayob is a nice guy for sure... but I have no feeling towards him! ...no feeling at all! Understand? If you have no feelings for him, and if I tell you that I have feelings for him... Would you be mad at me? Why didn't I see all these before? Ayob's future is right infront of my eyes... If I knew it a bit earlier, I would not have wasted my time with Ayob... ...giving him false hope. But... And the meeting that I planned was a success... Regarding the model, please make sure he is 20 something... handsome... tall... got the style... not shy, ok? Just taken from the kitchen and still hot! How much is this Markonah? Can you not ask for the price? Taste it first! Is it nice? Taste it! That's it... we adjourn the meeting to tomorrow? Just have a taste... Markonah... how much for one container? See you tomorrow yeah? We have meeting tomorrow! Oh nobody wants to try it? Please tell us the price? Being asking you few times! Specifically because of you Miss Nikki... It's One Ringgit per piece! There are 50 inside here, so it's 50 ringgit! Why? One ringgit per piece... there are 50 in the container... so its 50 ringgit? Eee no way! Eee so stingy... eh look, this is 44 year old, you know! So how to maintain the charm... this figure, and what more to maintain the body... Cosmetic is not cheap... likewise to buy pills! That insertion stuffs? So costly! So those cost are included into the price... Otherwise, who wants me? See? Stingy...! Suddenly my brilliant idea triggers again... but Markonah... would you like to get married? Crazy if I say no... I will find a husband for you... I promise... Even you have no boyfriend, how are you going to find one for me? Markonah... Markonah... why are you so slow to pick up... that's why all you know is to make drinks and selling rempeyek... it has been 15 years! Precisely mom, I can guarantee you... people will be excited with the idea! Please believe me on that website idea! Whatever Melatisukma... but Melatisukma must not forget... In 21 days, you must bring someone of your choice to see us. But mom, it's true... I'm confident the andartu.com surely gonna explode, mom! Andartu. Com... mom and dad must believe on the andartu. Com! Hmmm... we will see... What's wrong with you mom? What are you up to? You don't know your mother Melatisukma... Your mother is very intelligent you know... Surely I got other plan for my daughter... What the heck is that? There's something! I never thought my mother will actually induce a flower bath that could ease my marital luck... ...so ridiculous! According to my gut feeling, Mak Esah can tell that Fatimah's daughter is being blocked! Furthermore, Mak Esah can sense that her condition is awful! I am sick? Nothing to worry, Mak Esah has never failed... Nik Melatisukma can get married... Confirm! Me got married... for sure? But on one condition... After the success of matching up Sarah with Ayob, my heart thrilled, delighted and I feel confident of finding a husband for myself and also for other spinsters... However, I noticed the little changes in me after that flower bath. Whatever I do all become fruitful. Tried so many ways... This is most likely come to 7th... Introducing the new member of Andartu. Com! He is now in the category of "old bachelor" or the famously known as TERUTU. Your name is Mr. Sapri bin Samperit Yes... Miss nikki, do you think I still have hope? Put it this way teacher... Companion, wealth, living and death are all under God's provision... We just have to be patient... That's right... the grandfather reminds the same thing! The wealth is already here... death is round the corner... Only companion is not there! Well teacher... your name sounds unique! That's what I want to ask... sorry if my question may be a bit sensitive! Sapri bin Samperit, is that your real name or comercial? It is my real name... stated in my Birth Certificate! To be more rhythmic... Sapri Samperit, looks like two cut poem! The meaning has got nothing to do with Raya cookies namely 'samperit'? It has! Has it! My father was born, while his mother was baking the samperit... Now, lets touch on the criteria okey... How old are you? Already sunset... 48! Oh my God... what takes you so long to find a wife? Too choosy... Not really... I am not choosy, just that people do not choose me! I like her, she doesn't like me, she doesn't like me, I like her... If you ask me, there's so many weird things that I want... Needless to say, my preference is Erra Fazira! Erra Fazira? If I can't get her, someone that looks like her is good enough... Teacher, do you like rempeyek? Certainly without rempeyek life is not complete! If there is no rempeyek, kerepek would do... do you know Ruminah Sidek? She is my auntie... her rempeyek... marvelous! Now I'm confused... I want to find a spouse or rempeyek? Hmm... I think Cikgu Sapri and Markonah are meant for each other. Markonah, what is wrong with cikgu Sapri? He looks like a decent guy... I am convinced he suits you... No I don't want... he is not handsome... likewise short like bonsai plant! What is 'potot'? Potot... Gnome... Shortie... Dwarf! Please... he is so awful! Then, what type of person you really like actually? Who are you waiting for? Waiting for... Beyonce! In that case, why don't you find someone like Jay Z... ...or rather Angelina Jolie's husband, what his name is? Brad Pitt! It seems that Markonah is very particular... her taste is someone not less than Brad Pitt! Where can I find a Brad Pitt for Markonah? Is this Andartu.com or Big Productions? Both. Why? I would like to see Miss Nikki... is she in? Your name, sir? Don... Donna! AKA? Shamsudin B Mamat. Hurry-up, is Miss Nikki's around? I want to see her... I am Nikki... how are you? I'm fine. What was the intention... what was it? I don't know Miss Nikki... try to change... really burning! I know its burning... why don't you have a seat first! Mr. Shamsudin, have you registered on line? I've already registered online but I still want to see Miss Nikki... ...its about life and death! About life and death? Of what? I'm so tired of being an effeminate man. I try to test out if I could change to be a real man... If any of the women out there willing to be my wife... whom has been tainted. Oh for that Mr Samsudin needs no worry... That is the real objective of Andartu. Com. We will try to match you up with candidates who are registered with us... that we feel suits you! What about you Miss Nikki? Been able to find one? If nobody... here you are! I have... who is this next to you? Alisa. Alisa? As in the Identity Card? Ahmad Borhan. Mr. Ahmad Borhan having similar case like Mr. Shamsuddin... try to find the right person at Andartu. Com? I'm not... I'm keeping him company... Besides, I am yet to be like him! Oh... not just yet! Oh yes... My mother has a candidate for me... Let us see who's the next victim? I don't agree with you Nikki... You should realize that single mothers and the poor require proper protection... ...and I think education, jobs or business capitals are better than those who married to wealthy men, but simply taking advantage of them. I know but... We have a lot of development programmes... For example we can organize charity programmes... fund drives... to help the needy. He never stop debating... Everytime we meet, he speaks for like 10 hours, and I got to talk only for 5 minutes... Sometimes I wonder whether his mouth ever felt tired of talking! My name is Putra Aziz Al-Biruni... Age 38... I am still single as in actual fact I would like to find a loyal and faithful candidate... ...always calm... wise... do not object! I can't take it anymore to listen to Putra Aziz Al-Biruni... I can get migraine that may spread into a brain cancer if I continue my relationship with him... But Omar Shariff... why is he always ON OFF in my life? Omar Shariff... Omar Shariff... the Egyptian actor? Do you know I am a fan of his films... I watched many of his movies! He is good... an actor full of characters, versatile. He starred in many Hollywood films such as Dr Zhivago. Putera Aziz Albiruni... Hold on... hold on... Hmmm... Putra Aziz Al-Biruni... you do not like girls who like to object, right? I... really like to object! But the greatest challenge in my life is my tendency to create chaos... And every time I started the chaos, it unfolds my stupidity... I can even consider Markonah as my competitor... Jeremy or 'apple' a nickname I gave him, has sparked up the fading flames out of my life... Hey does not fit... too boyish! And to save my neck from been marked as "a well looking for bucket '... ...so I offered Jeremy to be the model for a video-clip project. Huh look at Markonah... she keeps slashing the rights of the others... hate it! With my title as the 'producer' of the video clip, my presence at the filming location... ...is without suspicious as no one notice of my attempt on Jeremy, right? We have to cover line, babe... Hah this is not a scenes from the 'video clip' ok... this is me actually falling into the swimming pool! Hmm luckily a Malay hero saved me... who says Malay heroes are softy? I love you... Yes... I've successfully said the three magic words... ...And Jeremy is the man who managed to make me say it willingly... Who's Nikki? So this is the snake? Hey how dare you called me snake... Eh I'm human okey not a snake! Do you know that you are actually a snake... Ok I'd like to tell you now! I warn you... don't ever think of having an affair with my son ok? Which one is your son? I don't like you to disturb my son Jeremy! Jeremy is her son... now you know? If you still insist, I can get a court order... I'll sue you! Who cares? Sue... court... what is this? I didn't do anything wrong... I didn't spy on him... never hit him... we like each other... Like each other... But I don't like it! Who cares? Eh both of you... go and find a widow... Spinsters... find somebody your age... Why fancy a raw kid... a raw kid! Hasn'this office got big mirror, hang it on the wall? Tell them to look at the mirror! Why? Insensible person... Extreme spinster! How dare you pull her hair... lets see if I could pull yours! I realized my biggest mistake was due to repeatedly put high hopes that... ...all men will be the same like my ex-Iover way back in Indiana, John Johnny Jonathan... Perhaps this time I do not want to be stupid like before... Furthermore, the dateline given by mother make my stomach sicks... I do not want to imagine who is the preferred bride chosen by my mother... If I reject Omar Shariff. And what really ironic... is that when anything happens to me... it seems like Omar Shariff's shadow is everywhere. Sarah, where did u put the other CD? Is it possible that we are destined together? Maybe Amanda, my paintball playmate was right... that he is my life partner. How ironic in the blink of an eye I agreed to marry Omar Shariff... ...and whom you see now is his mother sheathing my finger with our engagement ring. Will that fit the finger? Sarah, don't forget to invite all Andartu.com members okey? Very well Madam... invitation card or invite online? Actual card... It is not proper to invite virtually Sarah. You are very impolite, we are Malays, the invitation should follow the tradition. For sure... a well-mannered you! That mean we have to order 13 thousand cards... okey no problems! Thirteen thousand? Never mind... just use online... But I have the list of invitees that you must invite... So you have to get several invitation cards ready. While counting down the days to get married... I'm still not sure whether my decision was precise. Why taking so long? I'm frozen sitting here for so long... Be seated my dear... sit here! Be patient... she calls up now. Melati Sukma... open the door. Nikki... are you Ok? To marry or not to marry? Get married or not getting married? What is wrong with you... you want to get married or not? I don't want to get married! There she's behaving like before. Melatisukma... Nikki... is everything alright? Still need more time? Okey okey... I just need 10 minutes to think. What else you want? You've never changed! Just for a while... 10 minutes is all I need. It's has been one hour now... are you getting married or not? Be patient... Its alright... its alright... Please do not eat first yeah... Why taking so long? Its more than 3 hours now! I just need to talk to you for 15 seconds only. You go open the door. What's with you... hurry up! Come here... Nikki... I've been waiting for you more than 10 years... But as for today Nikki, I have to make a decision for the betterment of everybody... Decision? For the sake of you who never prepared to be my wife Nikki, I call off this marriage. ...Is it for real! Omar... thank you... I'm free... I'm free... I'm free! I'm free... I'm free... I'm free! This is my destiny... Melati Sukma bt Nik Mat has run away from her future husband on their wedding... If this is what love is, am I blind? If this is rebellious, Mom dad, please forgive me... John Johnny Jonathan... But I could not resist the tremendous feeling of love and my longing to John Johnny Jonathan... John... you disappeared for many years, why do you have to come back on my wedding day? Your shoe miss... your shoe! Don't forget your shoe... John Johnny Johnathan... Oh baby... my darling! I miss you... I miss you too... How are you? Fine... thank you! I miss you too... Where have you been? I miss you... I know! Miss you forgot your shoe! Who's that? ...who?
