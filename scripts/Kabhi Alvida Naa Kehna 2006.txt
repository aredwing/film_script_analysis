Two minutes to go... and the score stands at 1 all... The Rangers have the ball and are dribbling through... Is this going to be a goal? But just as I say that, Dev Saran has intercepted them... ... and has possession. My God! Look at him go... He's moving closer and closerto the goal... Just look at him go. Dev Saran looks determined... Is this going to be the decider? Oh my God! He's underthe D... he's through...he's through them all... Is that going to be a penalty? That definitely should be a penalty... If that's a penalty... the Rangers probably just threw the game away... Good morning Sir. The limousine is ready forthe wedding. What wedding?

My son's getting married... My son's getting married... Today I'm going to part with my daughter and get a daughter-in-law home... Hey Maya... We are coming... I'm the happiest guy in the wor... Hey, what's with you? Dude... I'm nervous... -Why? It's taken herthree years to say 'yes'... She won't run away at the last minute, will she? No... No... She can't run away anywhere... Yeah... After all where will she find a husband like me, right? No... Our security is very tight... Move it... Move it... We are already running late... Oh my God! Chris... Why are you serving this now? This is not a dip... It's dessert... It's called suji ka halwa... Who Suzie? - Not Suzie... Give it to me... Come on... Go... Go into the kitchen... They'll drive me mad... All the idiots from New York... God... That scared me... - Didn't mean to... Hello...- Hello... I'm Sam... And this is my house... I'm Kamal, and this is my food... Really... may I? Wow... Definitely a sardarni... How did you know that? Because I have been fed and slapped by them... I know... I have heard a lot about you... Don't go by what others say... But all that's said is always by others, Mr. Talwar... Whose word does one go by then? Mine... My word... You are from Chandigarh... And how did you figure that out? Definitely Chandigarh... Mom... What are you doing? Just... Nothing... Ready to go? No... I don't know what's taking the bride so long... You carry on... I'll come on my own... Are you sure? -Yeah... You go... Excuse me... excuse me... Please don't mess the garden... I have just cleaned it up... Are you the gardener? -What do you think? I think you have stolen the bride's clothes... Should I inform inside? Could you please leave me alone? - Of course...not... It's your wedding and you are sitting outside here... Why? Do you have a problem? Not directly... But indirectly I do... My mother has a problem... The fasteryou go inside, the faster my mother can leave from here... You are a strange man... You sat down? Should I lie down and chat? One to one discussions always happen sitting down... - Discussion? Yes... I know you have a problem... Come on... Talk to me... Tell me your problem... Why should I discuss my problem with you? So you admit you have a problem... By the way, I don't take advice from anyone... ... but I'm always ready to give advice to others... You should always listen to strangers... Sometimes they know betterthan our own... Are you married? Einstein... It's five years today... What did you think before marrying? Who thinks before marrying? Just kidding... Rhea and me, are friends from college... So we thought we'd give our friendship a new meaning... ...besides what can be betterthan spending... ...your entire life with yourfriend? At times friendship replaces love and then there's no space left for love... Yeah... yeah... By the way, the guy waiting foryou inside... ...is he yourfriend oryour love? You can't take that long... I have known Rishi since childhood... After my parents died, Rishi and his father have been my family... Oh... What a sweet family... But that's not the answerto my question... Do you love him? I do... But not the way I thought I would... Like how? Like in good books and bad films? That kind of love? No... The way love ought to be... That kind of love... That kind of love... But where does it exist anymore? Listen to this... 'The sagas of everlasting romances have gone past long ago... Just learn to make do with tiny love stories...' Does that mean you don't love your wife? You can't take that long... We are happy... We have made our little world together... That's not the answerto my question... The question here is more about your life than my answer... You are at a crossroad in life where there are two roads... One that leads to happiness, which I think you deserve... ..and the otherthat leads to an endless wait... Wait for love... Which you may neverfind... What if I find that love after marriage? If you don't look for it... you won't find it... And you are definitely not finding it sitting on this bench... Go inside and get married... The wedding is waiting foryou... ...and here you are sitting with a stranger making small talk... You should be ashamed... What will people say? Shame on you... Go on... go... go and get married... Go... It was nice talking to you... Well... I'd rather be playing football... But it was a pleasure to meet you, Ma'am... Maya... Dev... Dev Anand... bad one... Now go fast, get married and be happy... Good bye... Sayonara... Goodbye... Not good bye... Goodbye kills the hope of meeting again... And who knows? We may meet again...

You should never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... They say time heals all wounds... But in some relationships, some wounds only get deeper with time... Do you guys have a permit forthis? Damn... Ready? Black Beast... That's the new fearthat stalks New York... Known as the Black Beast, this dangerous criminal has kidnapped... ...yet another child from Central Park... No one knows if it is a man or a woman... He's nicknamed Black Beast.... ...because the criminal wears a trademark long, black coat... Shit... Don't cry my son... don't cry... I'm right here... What the... What are you doing? Sitting on my leg... Sorry sir... Please don't mind... My Tinu here is just a little nervous... ...he thinks the Black Beast is going to kidnap him... Please don't mind sir... please...

The world can go crazy... And be at theirfeet... And yet these beauties... Don't know what love is... Rock and roll, my love My heart sings foryou... Rock and roll... Come sway with me... Rock and roll, my love My heart sings foryou... Rock and roll, my love Come sway with me... Head in a cap and a red scarf waving... Oh... What do I say? Fair skinned maiden with a black strand on the face... Oh... What do I say? These pretty faces... These beautiful women... They don't know what love is... Or what it is to be loyal... These stonehearted lovers... What do they care? What we go through, coping with them? They are ignorant... like strangers... What do they know about feelings? They don't know... they don't care... That hearts can break with words they say... Like asking for comfort from fire... Orfire from ice... We have spent out entire lives... Now we know what we lost... Wasting ourtime that was precious... Rock and roll... My heart sings foryou... Rock and roll, my love Come sway with me... Rock and roll, my love My heart sings foryou... Rock and roll, my love Come sway with me...

Rock and roll, my love... Come sway with me... Maya... Rishi... And all you wonderful people... Thank you for being here with me tonight... And I hope that all of you are having a great time... yeah! Yeah! You know, people always ask me why I throw this party every year... What's so special about this day? The day is special... It's on this day that I met my wife forthe first time... That's why, every year, I celebrate... ... this day and also seek herforgiveness... Forgiveness for each day... ... when I chose my dreams over my relationships... Forgiveness for each minute when... ... I hurt her and didn't even botherto make up... But, most of all, forgiveness for all those innumerable moments... ... when I forgot to tell her how much I loved her... ... assuming that I will have a lot of time to say so... But I was wrong... With her death I lost that time... That's why I always say that time means 'now'... If you have to love, love 'now'... If you have to ask forforgiveness, ask 'now'... If you want to hold hands, hold it 'now'... Or else years lateryou will find yourself at a party like me... ... asking forforgiveness from your beloved... So... All you wonderful married couples out there... Look to your partner and tell them 'I love you'... And all of you that are single... Turn this way... Girls only... And tell me that... Alright... Ok... This speech is getting really boring... Let's party... Come on guys... Hit it... Eh Chandigarh... Last night I encountered the real Samarjit hidden... ...behind 'Sexy Sam'... I liked him... Really? And what was the difference between Sam and Samarjit? Sam runs after girls and Samarjit, after memories... You really miss your wife very much... Don't you? I can understand... Tell me... How do you cope with your loneliness? I spend time with friends... I have very few friends... Not from today... Oh... so you will be my friend? Absolutely... So... friendship means no touching? All you are going to get is this... Thank you... It's good for a start... Mummy! What... What are your intentions? The intentions are very noble my son... Just that I won't take dowry... I'm anti dowry... Mom... What is he saying? Sam... What are you saying? - Kamal... What is he saying? What are all of you saying? I'm scared to come out of the station... You never know what you'll get to see... Not only the station... you should not get out of the house at all... The world is evil... Sam... Just a minute... Both of us... Wow! So now it's 'us', huh? Samarjit and I, are both alone... We lost our love years ago... And when two people are going through the same phase.. ...they understand each other better... They become close... What they can't say to others... they can say to each other... Precisely... Two strangers... Same situation... Then friendship... and the problem is solved... That's it... Simple... right, Maya? Cheers! My marriage is failing, Dev... And from what I can see, so is yours... I can't save my marriage on my own... I need a friend... Afriend who will understand me... who will make me understand... Who is familiar with my circumstance... And who can do this betterthan you? That's why I'm here to extend a hand in friendship... Will you accept it? I'm hurting, Maya... I want to sit down... And that's how two strangers came together... ...to save their relationships, and gave birth to a new one... On that rainy day, neither of us saw the storm that awaited us... Afterthat we met everyday... I don't know why, but when I was with Maya, I was different... I had found my lost smile... We had considerably increased the business... ...of the New York cafes quite a lot... We spoke a lot about Rhea and Rishi... How wrong they were... How right we were... then how right they were and how wrong we were... But in relationships, no matter who's right and who's wrong... ...someone has to make the first move... And we decided it should be ours... This is a very interesting book... It says don't look foryour spouse's faults in your marriage... Improve your own flaws... And what if someone's perfect? Ya... Right... Anyway let's start with me... ...tell me all the things that are wrong with me... And listen tell me the truth... be frank... be honest... orthere's no point... Alright... here goes... You are that teachertype... Boring... with no personality... You are a compulsive cleaner to the point of illness... ...basically, you are a loyal maidservant... What? You don't have anything womanly in you... You are not sexy... Not from any angle... Maybe from behind... But no man will get excited looking at you... I know your husband gets excited... ...but that's probably because he is visually impaired ... because you don't have... Dev... You are so rude... So mean... What mean? Rude? Didn't you just ask me to speak the truth? But you could have said something nice... But did you ask me to say something nice? And what would you say if I had? That your eyes are the most beautiful eyes in the world... But you didn't ask, so I didn't say... You know what your problem is? You don't know how to speak to a lady... And you know how? Yes... I know what to say to a woman and how... Oh... So you are a lesbian? Shut up... I know because my husband says... ... the most romantic things to me everyday... Any woman would go crazy listening to them... Right... Except you of course... - Listen...Do you want to learn or no? Wow... This place has so many beds... Maya, if you were so desperate, we could have booked a hotel room... Why have we come here? Listen, Dev... I have no time foryour sense of humour... You have to learn a lot on this bed... On this bed? What are the new things you are going to teach me here? Just so you know only my leg is broken... All the other parts are absolutely perfect... OK... This is not going to work... No... Dev, serious... Serious... Serious? -Yeah... serious... Ok... the situation is that Rhea has come back tired from work... Now I will tell you what you need to do... I'm Dev and you are Rhea... understand? No... I don't but whatever... Let's start... - Let's start... Ok... Bouncy bouncy bed... Start... -What? - Rhea... Oh yeah... I'm Rhea... Rhea would say... As soon as she came home... It's been a long tiring day! I think you need a massage... - I do? Here? It feels good, huh? Actually, it does... really... You can't do this... Oh, Rhea... You are so beautiful! Rhea... Your eyes... Your lips... ..Your everything... Oh! Your arms... I want to die in them... Don't stop! No... no... Go... Come here... come here... I'm taking this bed... Please do... Maya... Rishi... says and does all these things to you... And yet you don't... you... don't... Actually, you are quite sexy... really... You just need to show it to Rishi... That's all... What's this? - This is my sister... -What? We were separated as children... Maya... You need to wear clothes like these foryour husband... No... Dev... If I wear clothes like these... ...I will look like 'that' type of a woman... Yeah... That's the type that men like... Dev... But that looks cheap... Yeah... Cheap... Cheap is nice... I like cheap! Maya... You taught me how to talk to women... how to massage them... how to romance them... If you want to learn how to be sexy... then ask me... I'm the man... Dev... Don't worry... This will protect you... But this... But not that... 'Butt' this! That's the whip... Hit me baby... hit me... So dude... tell me... Did you tell Maya about this last minute football party? You think she'd allow if I told her? You are so dead, man! Hey, Rhea... The head office is still waiting foryour answer... What have you decided? I know, Jai, but please understand...

The head office has offered me a promotion... ...they want me to shift to London... It means a better position, higher salary, big house... ...basically the works... And this morning I decided that... ... that you will shift... Wow! And of course there was no need to consult me... After all who am I? I'm just your husband? What status do I have? I'm just here to applaud foryour success... This one decision of yours can change all our lives... But why would you think of that? Because, Rhea Saran only thinks about herself... ...her rocking career, her success, her happiness... dammit... It's always about you, you and you... No goddamn it... It's about you, you and only you, Dev... I was just going to tell you that I have refused the promotion... Afterthinking about you... this family... But where do you listen? If you refused the promotion what was the need to tell me? Trying to show off your magnanimity? I wasn't showing off, Dev... I was baring my heart... Do you have a heart, Rhea? What heart? Arjun! Arjun! Stop that noise... This is no time to play the violin... It's time foryou to sleep... You've got school tomorrow... Go now... Don't touch the violin... get out of here... Arjun! Arjun! Why are you venting your anger on him? What has he done? Don't you dare tell me how I should behave with Arjun, Rhea... I know how to handle him... I have brought him up... Only I... You had no time from your work... Did you ever have time for him? Did you? Yes Dev... I didn't have time... because I work very hard... No one asks men when they are busy... ...when they have no time fortheir children... Then why are you asking me? Tell me Dev, how can you ask me? Because the truth is, that I'm the man in this house... I couldn't be Arjun's mother because I had to be his father... So that he could have all the happiness.. ...that a football coach cannot afford to give him... How did that sound, Dev? It hurts, doesn't it? Now you know how it feels? You have only hurt me, Dev... I always thought you hurt those you love the most... But that's not true... You don't love me at all... You don't love anyone... You only hate... You hate yourself... your life... yourfailure... And I haven't been able to figure out what angers you more.. ... yourfailure or my success! Yes, Rhea... I'm a failure... That's true... But do you know, there's a greater failure than me in this house? And that's our relationship... Our marriage... Thank you, Rhea... Thank you, for letting me stay in your house, Rhea... Why are you so angry, Rishi? What's the big deal if I didn't feel like it one night? Come on... Don't behave like a child! Shut up! Just shut up! I have heard enough! What's the problem, Rishi? Maya... Do you rememberthe last time we were intimate with each other? When, Maya? When did we touch each other? Held hands or embraced? Anything? Do you remember? When did we not turn our backs to each other in bed? Do you remember? I don't remember... You don't remember or don't want to remember? I don't want to discuss this... Why? I thought you like discussions... Come on... let's discuss... let's discuss why... Why my wife doesn't want to sleep with me? Come on... Our relationship cannot grow just by sleeping with each other, Rishi... It can only grow when we embrace each other's sorrow and happiness... And when was the last time we did that? When, Rishi? A husband and wife don't just share a bed ... they share their lives... What? How dare you? Do you think I'm the kind of man... ..who only feels the need for his wife in bed? How dare you, Maya? To embrace each other's happiness and pain, one has to embrace each other... And you have neverfelt that way about me... 'You are a child, you are a child, you are a child...' I'm fed up of hearing that... If I was truly a child, I'd have broken down long ago... I tolerate you because I'm a man! I have heard enough... Today you cannot leave like this... You will have to tell me today... The truth... tell me... Why did you marry me? Why? I married you because I love you... But why did you marry me, Maya? Tell me... Why did you marry me? Rishi, leave me please... Rishi, please... You are hurting me... Rishi... Rishi... Rishi... The truth, Maya, is that you never married me... You compromised... I'm your life's biggest compromise... A compromise that you regret every day of your life, right? Give me an answer... What answer? You have nothing to give ... Not love... Not happiness... Not affection... You haven't even been able to give me a child! And Maya, I have never made you feel inadequate about that... never... You just did... Just did... Rishi... Fouryears ago, you said that everlasting romances don't exist anymore... Remember, Dev? Will you say the same even now? Fouryears ago, you said that... ...if I don't look for love after marriage I won't find it... What will you say now, Dev? What will you say? Answer me... What are you and me doing at the station in the middle of the night? What are we doing, Dev? Answer... I need answers to all these questions... I don't know... - Tell me... Where are you going, Dev? I want the answers... tell me, Dev... tell me... Answer... I want to know... tell me... 18 th March 2002... You met me forthe first time, Maya... I rememberthe exact time, Maya... Since that day I have felt like I have known you forever... Is this the answerto your question? Maybe not... Maybe this... Everyday yourtrain leaves the station at 4.32... ...and mine at 4.21... and everyday I miss my train so... ..that I can spend some more moments with you... Is this the answerto your question? Dev... Everyday I leave you at the station but yourthoughts don't leave me... Is this the answerto your question? Then try this... I'm a married man Maya, and I think you forget.. ... that you are too... Since both of us are married.. ...what are we doing at the station in the middle of the night? Bingo... Bingo... I think I have the answer... That's the answerto your question, right? Listen to the answer... I love you, Maya... ...and you love me too! Mom, why are we discussing this? You are Dev's mother... you will take up for him... I'm a woman before I'm a mother, Rhea... And I know you are right... But what happens just because I think so... ...the situation is not going to change... Things will only change when Dev changes... And that's not going to happen... Rhea... Rhea... Mom... please... I'm tired... I've tried enough to understand him... to get closerto him... One fine day, he just decided to step back from the relationship... He did not step back, Rhea... You raced ahead... You have to wait for him... Why? Why is a woman always expected to wait? Because they are stronger... And have you thought about Arjun? I'm not the kind of woman... ...who will use her child as an excuse to back down... I'm not that weak... You are not weak... Your relationship is... You have to give it strength... You have to give it time... I will give this relationship nothing till Dev gives it love... You are going somewhere? Paris... Forten days... To organize a few events... Last night the things you said to her... Last night I said a lot of things I shouldn't have... ...and a few that were very important to say... Try to understand her, Rishi... How do I understand a heart that has no place for me? That's not true, Rishi... She loves you a lot... Look into her eyes... Who else can all that love be for? I wish the love in her eyes reached her lips once in a while... Dad, everyday I tell her how much I love her... has she ever said it? Sorry, dad... I can't take it... Not anymore... Now? Now what, Dev? It was important to say that we love each other... So we've said it... And what did we gain by saying it? I don't know but if we hadn't, we would have lost something... You know Dev, that this relationship has no future... Yes... I know... That's why it needs to be abandoned on this beautiful note... One last cup of coffee? No... Yourtrain... Not my train anymore... I'm planning to stop traveling by train... Buy myself a new car... A nice new blue car... You like blue? I like blue... Your life is empty... I can see it in your eyes... Do you remember when we touched each other? Held hands? Anything? Do you remember? I leave you at the station everyday but yourthoughts never leave me... To embrace each other's happiness and pain,one has to embrace each other... And you have neverfelt that way about me... Since both of us are married... ... what are we doing at the station in the middle of the night? You have to tell me today, Maya... tell me the truth...Why did you marry me? Sometimes friendship takes the place of love... ... and then there's no place left for love... The truth is, that you never married me, Maya... You compromised... Listen to the answer, Maya... I love you Maya... And you love me too... And what if I find my soul mate after marriage? Dev... I like blue... [ Skipped item nr. 1342 ] Do you know when we reached here...? I am yours and you, mine... I'm wonderstruck at this moment... When moonlight has emerged in the middle of the day... It seems awake yet it's dreaming... My lovelorn heart...

When moonlight has emerged in the middle of the day... It seems awake yet it's dreaming... My lovelorn heart... We were crazy... We were strange... We were different... Very different... Incomplete on our own but so complete together... We were not walking on the ground... There, we had slipped long ago... We were flying in the sky... Talking to the clouds... We didn't have a care in the world... We had made our own world... Our world... Maya and Dev's world... The world of our dreams... But then dreams always leave when you wake up to reality... Come on, drink your milk fast... I don't want to drink it... - Drink it! Here... - It's ok... It's ok, Dev... Thank you... I don't know what to do, Sam... I was going to ask you for advice and I come to know... ...that it's the same situation in your house too...God! Every house seems to have the same story... Will you stop this TV soap commentary? Sam... be serious for once... What's the point of being serious... Look... Your son is mule headed... He is not going to do anything... Maya isn't at fault so she isn't going to do anything... So what do we do, Kamlu? I know... You do have a point... Whatever needs to be done has to be done by Rhea and Rishi... But they are both being so stubborn... Who will convince them? What if they convince each other? And why will they do that? They hardly know each other... Precisely... two strangers... same situation... Then, friendship and problem solved... remember? But how will they meet each other? Dad... What are we doing here? I haven't bought you a present in a long time... So I thought I'd do that today... Dude, it's a toy store... -Yeah... So? It's for kids... But to me you will always be a kid... Mom... Should I take this for Arjun? Yes... take it... It's very nice... It's fantastic... You have very good taste...

By the way what are you doing here? We had come here to buy a soft toy for my grandson... ...which he can cuddle upto in the night... Even I was looking for something like that... And I saw you... Neither am I soft nor am I a toy... So please stay away... Much as I am enjoying this conversation... can we please move on? Of course... of course... of course... There are so many beautiful things here... red... blue... green... Come on darling... help me get this one... Don't you think that was weird behavior? You think he was hitting on my mother-in-law? Oh no... you don't need to worry about that... ...he pretty much hits on anything that moves... Ok I'm getting late... I have to go... Where are you heading? -Work... 55th and 5th... Oh great... I'll walk you... - Sure... -Alright... Sam... I think it worked... So... what did you say your name was? Charlotte... - Charlotte... You are gorgeous! Why are people so happy in New York? Because they are not married... That's why... Right... They are single... No tension in life... No problem... No stress... They go home... shower... freshen themselves... Watch TV... then they go out and get lucky... We... we go home and get unlucky... True... We go home to a sourface... That likes nothing... That likes no one... Not even us... I mean look at us...

The problem is that my work is that kind... I never have the time to express my feelings... And I keep expressing my feelings all the time... So what's stopping you today? Nothing's stopping you either... Do you like diamonds, Maya? Diamonds? Large, beautiful... expensive diamonds... Yeah of course... Good... tell your husband to buy them foryou... Dev... I have bought you flowers... Call Dev... Call him now... Ok... I'll call him if you speak to Maya... Why should I speak any longer? I'm meeting you in five minutes...

And you are the coolest... ok? You can play violin as much as you want from today... Play it day and night... Wheneveryou want... I won't say anything... You know why? Why? I'll show you... because now I have this... Go on play the violin... I don't hear nothing... Papa... Can I hug you? What? Can I hug you? No... because I'm going to hug you... And I have another idea... We will make an eleven memberteam... You play the violin in the forward position... Violin doesn't have a forward... What nonsense... And our band will be called Manchester United Philharmonic... Ok? Rishi... all this... - May I? I cleaned the entire house... It took three hours... the food's ready... really... With these very hands I phoned and called forfood... But it's the thought that counts, right? - Right... And that's not all... This whole weekend... You and me...

After all family is family... Right? So, Rishi is taking you to meet the rest of his family at the zoo? Rishi is taking me to the ballet... Ballet? Where men dance without underwear?

Well done... At last there's someone who can shut you up... Tell me Rishi, was he always like this or is this change recent? He behaves like a tiger now but he was a mouse before my mother... Rishi... behave... His mother was a very strict woman... She used to say, 'you can look... but don't you dare touch!' And these days there's no time to look... Too busy touching... Very bad... Oh Mom... I really hope you are not listening... Your Mom and her rules... It's not about rules, Mr. Talwar... It's about limits... It's very easy to slip in a marriage... It's difficult to keep control... I personally feel every relationship should have its boundaries... And I believe more the boundaries... ...more the chances of them being crossed... Well... I don't really agree with you... Maya you tell me... What do you think? Maya doesn't need to draw any boundaries... ...because her husband loves hertoo much... Flattery... Flattery... When a man uses flattery it only means two things... Either he is lying or he is hiding something... Really... These days Dev is flattering me a lot... You think I need to worry... Actually you should... Everyone's been speaking a lot... About relationships... But relationships are not about words... ...they are about circumstances... No one knows why one slips in a relationship... Why one falls in love outside a relationship... No one knows... Even I don't know why it happened with me... But it did... Rhea, I am in love with someone else... I'm sorry, Rhea but that's the truth... And the woman I fell in love with is right here... Right here. It's Maya... What happened, Mr. Talwar? No sense of humour? I was just joking... Dev... That really wasn't funny... I was going to kill you... I was going to kill him before you... You are a bit crazy... Good joke... Good joke... What was wrong with you last night? What were you saying? You said whateveryou felt like... Did you think of me even once while saying all those things? Now who will answer Rishi's questions? You... Who else? Just tell him the truth... I don't care... Tell him the truth? Then what Dev? Leave the house? And come to you? Will you leave Rhea and your son? Tell me... No... I don't think so... - I thought so... Dev, don't touch me... Dev... just leave me. You were right, Dev... You never know what you'll get to see outside this station... Let's go... It's all so dirty... Not been cleaned for so many days... Will you have coffee? What were you saying? Coffee? No... This Rishi... he just keeps anything anywhere... ...he's moved everything around... Dad, you'll have tea? Oh... you never have tea... I'm crazy... What am I saying? Just need to clean all this... You are late? Yes... Too late... Dude... Any message for Mom? Rishi... - Maya... I wanted to apologise, Dad... But apologies are for mistakes... What's the punishment for selfishness? I'm a father... I can't punish... I can only advise.... Leave Rishi... You don't love him... By being with him like this... ...you are keeping him away from his true love... And yourself too... These incomplete relationships will bring happiness to no one... Dad! It's not yourfault, Maya... Love and death... both come uninvited... No one has any control overthem... He's going away... He's not going to make it... I don't want to lose my Dad, Maya... Thank God I have you... Chandigarh... We knew this was the end of our journey... These were the last few breaths of our love story... We had to collect these moments... ...and breathe a new life into our old relationships... It was time to go home... We had to tell Rishi and Rhea the truth... Because happiness can never bloom in the shadow of lies... No one knew this betterthan us... Rhea... There's another woman in my life... That's not funny anymore... I'm not joking... Forthe last six months... But it's over now... Maya... Why it happened... I don't have any answers... But I want to give our marriage another chance... Do you love her? How does it matter? It matters to me... If I had to do what you did... would you forgive me? You wouldn't, Dev... You would neverforgive me... You will have to leave this house... This marriage is over... Rishi... Listen to me... Listen to me... Rishi... Rishi... Did you sleep with him? You slept with him? Tell me, Maya... How was it? Was it fun? Did you have fun? Tell me... Tell me... How strange Maya, that you kept cleaning this house all the time ... ...and today you have brought in so much filth... Don't say that, Rishi... - Then what should I say? What should I do? Celebrate? Should I celebrate that my wife is sleeping with another man? I'm sorry, Rishi... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Why did you do this.. Why did you do this to me, Maya? I loved you so much... More than my own self... More than life... But it wasn't enough foryou, right? It's not like that, Rishi... Then how is it, Maya? Every morning I woke up to look into your eyes... To search for my face... But now I will only see him ... And I will not be able to bearthat... But that relationship is over, Rishi... This relationship is over, Maya... Then I'll leave...? I won't stop you... Try not to hate me, Arjun... Rhea... I want to say something to you... Dev didn't ask me before stepping out of this marriage... Neither did you ask me before throwing him out... But my grandson's eyes ask me whether I'm going to leave him... I can't do that, Rhea... So if you have no objections... I would like to stay with you... Can I? Hello... hello... Dev... Maya... Yeah... Got dialled by mistake... Are you ok? Did you... Tell Rishi... Rishi? I told Rishi everything... What did he say? He was very angry at first... But with time I know he will forgive me... He's a good man... And Rhea? Even she will forgive me with time... After all family is family... Yeah... Family is family... Yeah Rhea... I'm coming... Even I am at home... with Rishi... Be happy... Goodbye... All our relationships were defined by this one word... Both of us left our homes and didn't even tell each other about it... I had never seen the hope of meeting again.. ...die such a silent death before... [ Skipped item nr. 1933 ] Your heart knows... And so does mine... That our roads are meant to part... Far apart though we will be... Please don't go away from my memories... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Hi, Good morning. - Hi Miss. My name is Maya Tal... My name is Maya. All the mirth in life has slipped away slowly... It's the pain that refuses to go away... Tried to wish it away... tried to laugh it away... But the heart fails to find peace... ...fails to find peace... Are these tears? Or is it cinder? No... Just fire that flows freely from my eyes... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Seasons come... and seasons go... But the season of pain is here to stay... The shade of sorrow is so deep... That it will take a while to pale... Who knows what's to happen ahead... Who knows what's in store for us to bear... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Your heart knows... And so does mine... That our roads are meant to part... Far apart though we will be... Please don't go away from my memories... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Never say goodbye... Thanks... Do you know Maya, that in these three years, I tried hard to hate you... To forget you... but I couldn't... ...couldn't do it, Maya...

I am being a motherto my son after many years... At this point I'm happy with this one relationship... And... You don't have to say anything... ljust want you to know that I'll be waiting... Ok? I'm sorry... ljust came to say 'Bye'... Rhea... You just get ready... I'll wait foryou outside... And good luck with your job in Canada... What time is yourtrain? In two hours... Arjun... I know... I met Mom... He probably forgot that I was leaving today... Rhea... I have lost my right to ask you forforgiveness... ...but I don't want to lose the right to bless you... Have a good life... You stay in touch... God! Rhea... We are really late... I'm so sorry, Jai... Don't worry about it... Jai... I'm going to kill you... You missed the ceremony... Not my fault, sweetheart... Blame it on Rhea... Congratulations... Rhea... It's so nice to finally meet you... Jai talks about you all the time... Well I hope good things... Of course... You haven't met my husband...Sweetheart?

Jai you are never going to believe who's in town... Honey... we'll see you later... Rhea... See you in a bit... Rishi? Your wedding? What about Maya? Maya and I separated three years ago... And you here? With Jai? Dev and I divorced three years ago... But do Dev and Maya know this? Maya... What's the matter Maya? Can't look me in the eye... can't face me... Because you broke my heart? My home? How could you break something that was already broken, Maya? Maybe you shouldn't have filled the void between Dev and me... But what could you do? Dev's love is like that... Ask me... I know... Don't be so large-hearted Rhea that I feel even smaller... I'm not that magnanimous... When Dev told me about you I left him... But I don't think you know that... How strange! The love that changed the destinies... ...of two homes today stands destitute... I moved on... Rishi moved on... The two of you got left behind... Perhaps that's our punishment... Such a small punishment? Try living with Dev... Then you will know what punishment is... Ok... I had to fight fifty women forthis... It's tradition... ...the girl who gets these flowers gets a new life... ... new happiness... And I want that girl to be you, Maya... Your heart has been searching for love for many years... ... and that love is Dev... And if you don't hurry now your love will move further away from you... Dev is leaving for Toronto... His train leaves in fifteen minutes... Go, Maya... Go get your love before it's too late... Go... Thank you... And Rhea? Even she will forgive me with time... Maya! Dev... Aren't you a little overdressed forthe station? Sorry... It's been a while hasn't it? I don't live here anymore... And I don't live here despite being here... Watch where you are going! Nothing's changed Dev... You still get angry at everything... Anger's my own... Doesn't leave me... Love can always leave and go... What will you do if you find your lost love? What will I say now, Maya... I'll just say 'go back'! Dev... Only I know how I have survived these three years... There was not a moment in the day when I didn't think of you... But I used to convince myself that you are alright... ...you are happy with yourfamily... I used to think of your happiness.. ...and it would reduce a bit of my unhappiness... But today I realized that you have been as alone as I am... Yes, Dev... Even I have been alone forthree years... Alone... Like you... Why, Dev? Why did all this happen? Why? Why did we meet? And then part? Why, Dev? Why? Everyone shares happiness and sorrow... I want to share my punishment with you... My life may not be complete living with you... ... but at least it will be a life... Will you share this incomplete life with me, Maya... Answer me, Maya... It's hurting... Answer...I can't sit here the whole... What do you want me to do? Go down on my knees? Shut up... Just shut up... Speak politely... Ok... Hello... Thank you... Nice to meet you... I love you... Dammit! I love you too... Come on... Now? Now what? Fifteen days in jail... What? Yeah... I stopped the train by pulling the chain... Why are you wearing this silly saree? I'd gone for Rishi's wedding... The foundation of a marriage should only be love... And nothing else... because if the foundation is wrong, relationships end... Like it happened with us... Years later, we found love... Happiness... But we just wish that... ... the road to our destination didn't have to be paved with broken hearts...
