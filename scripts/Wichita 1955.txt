Businessman if I find business. Maybe another team? A living room, that's the case the most profitable. It's not my department. I respect the horse ... Leave it behind the shop. Thank you. - I will pay you. - No way. You are the first not wanting to open a salon. It is a pleasure to help. - How do I go? - It will do the trick. Wait. Pass it by. It will not be dirtier.

Excuse me. I know where is the station? Yes, sir. I go there. - Thank you. - Nothing. - My name is Wyatt Earp. - Bat Masterson. You were brave to face a gun. I do not know what got into me, Mr. Earp. I lost my cool. It was a mistake. For sure. But you could not do otherwise. It starts. Wichita would be a point on the road ... ... If there had been a man, I am pleased to present. Ladies and gentlemen, the man who brought the railroad to Wichita. Sam McCoy. I just want to say something and in a few words. Wichita is the largest and prosperous city in the West ... ... If anyone remembers one thing: the cattle! It is a terminus railway. The point of embarkation the breeding area. From here we feed all the United States. Do not forget it. It is a city farm. A city for breeders. Here, we will ship thousands of cows. Hundreds of cowboys will come here. This will be our bread every day. Yours, mine, that of Wichita. Very well, work! You have all noticed, Bat? Almost everything. I will interview Mr. McCoy. See you, Mr. Earp. I'm glad to see there has effective journalists in Wichita. Thank you. I would like your story. My story? Where you are, what you did before, and so on. Okay, my friend. I have to go to the bank. Come with us. - We will discuss the way. - Good. - Where were you born? - Born? I was born in Philadelphia. Good morning. I want to open an account. Name? Wyatt Earp. E-A-R-P. Address? General Delivery to Wichita. Any file you want? Everything except that. There are 2460 dollars. - All right, John. - Thanks Sat I'm proud. Sign here, please. Everybody quiet! No one moves. Well, close. Take the jewelry. Relax, it's over. You, the men go out from here. Come on, move. I owe you a debt of gratitude. All of us. We're grateful. - I am Sam McCoy. - I know. I heard your speech. - My name is Wyatt Earp. - Nice to meet you. Ladies, I present Wyatt Earp. - My wife. - How are you, Mr. Earp? - And my daughter Laurie. - Hi. It is an honor. - Thank you. - Nothing, Miss McCoy. You are here on business? I would like, but I do not know what. Well, if you want work ... ... We have a problem enforce the law. Wichita grew up ... Thank you, Mr. Mayor, I am merchant, not police. In addition, you have a Sheriff. We would not refuse a another, especially a man like you. Think about it. I assure you, together, ... ... We will pay you very well. No, thank you, Mr. Good. Good luck what you do. - Count on me. - Thank you. Good day. Your book, Mr. Thank you. I was going to lose, right? A real man. Too bad he did not accepted the position He may accept it soon. This is a lawyer born. Do not lose sight of. FOREIGN leaked BANDITS - Good evening. - Bat, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Whiteside. What a title! "Foreign leaked bandits." Masterson loves alliteration. You should have seen the title he wanted to. = "Pistolero Protects Pognon Felling guilty. " - A glass? - No, thank you I explained to our reporter ... ... There is a difference between a gunslinger and a gunman How do you know Am I? I judge by deeds. An armed man defending the law. That's what you did. Did you like my story? This is the first. It is well written, but you do not say everything. You do not say what you did, you. He is a young very modest. and it is difficult to talk about himself in third person. By the way ... ... We talked about you. It is not the only, for that matter. If it's for the office of Sheriff, I'm not interested. We want to know why. Do not say anything if you do not want. I think there are others who would work in this career. Not me. Frankly, I do not blame you. It's hard work and thankless. Yes, in addition to maintaining order, Sheriff is always a target. Several gunmen dream to become famous by killing one. Count on me, Mr. Mayor. But only as a citizen, not as a man of the law. Good evening. It does not seem too much worry about the danger. Nobody likes you shoots him. No one fired at the Sheriff we have. Billy Smith? You call that a Sheriff? He was all his life. He was fired from all the villages this side of the Mississippi. How can he take when these cowboys are crazy here? I heard he had the chips Allsworth to it two years ago. "Chips"? Expression of the West, which means he was scared to death. I think I remember. Cowboys had drunk started shooting into the crowd They got rid of Smith. ... But put them in a foreign prison without firing a shot. And I remember his name. Wyatt Earp. What a shame. This is what we need. You should have seen how handles the revolver. He drew to injure, not to kill. He has other qualities, know how to take apart. He is a man of law, by vocation. But he refuses to admit it. What are you talking about? In Boston, I met a blacksmith which was the same. In his case, was religion. He was a born preacher. But he resisted. One day the preacher became ill. The blacksmith was replaced. He spent the rest of his life to serve God. The best predictor I've seen. Serve God and serve the Act, is not the same. I do not agree. Both need a dedicated man. You know what I mean by "dedicated". Go to bed, Arthur. Bat ... If I take care of him. You think Wyatt Earp accept the position? If he does, is that it's crazy. If he does not it will become unlivable here. You saw the cowboys terrorize a city? No, sir. I do. This is the show. They draw on windows, the lights ... ... Objects ... One night they killed my wife. You close, right? Yes, sir. Here they come, those who make history. Here! It's yours! The Texans are there and this city will never be the same. Listen, guys. I do not want see one sober man. - It is here, Sam - Well, Clint. How long will you stay in Wichita? There is no rush. The cowboys will not leave that when they will have more money. Or when you will more alcohol. About alcohol. I pay the first round. With pleasure. I pay the next. Babylon on the Arkansas River. Without hanging gardens. You have decided what kind business you get started? No, not yet. There is room for other bars. - I saw Bat come with chefs. - It will be good. He does not drink again. As long as it is with Wallace, the cowboys leave him alone. I hope. It's a good boy. His problem that he does not know fear. - And you? - Yes, I have learned. No, what you have learned, is discretion. Which, according to philosophers, is the best part of courage. Maybe. I have never tried problems deliberately, but ... ... But they are the ones who you are. You have a drink with me, Wyatt? No, thank you. Good evening. Yes, that's for sure. - Good evening. - Good evening. I help you? Very kind of you, it is very heavy. Well, they are there now. It's interesting, right? Yes, we can say that. Miss, I do not advise you to go alone in the streets. At least until the start of the cowboys. - You believe that there will be violence? - Yes, I think. - Thank you. - It was a pleasure. Ah, Miss McCoy. It may be that you hear shots that night. Do not worry, your mother and you. Stay away from windows and turn off the lights. I have heard of these Wild nights in the West, But I did not think it existed. If it exists. It is a concern, is not it? Yes. I have always lived in the West. I saw many villages like this one. Violence always affects me. I should be used. You are strange. - You think so? - Yes, the bank, you were different. I was born under an unlucky star It happens all the time things like that. You will be careful tonight? Yes. Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. Hey, boy! - Fill the glass. - Yes, sir. And voila, Gyp! I told you that you're swimming. We Texans, you can bathe together. I sold the entire herd. He leaves tomorrow. I saw several villages ephemeral but remain Wichita. - Ha! - Why do you laugh? You are drunk. Whiteside, you are a reporter drunk. I do not like journalists drunk. and sober. And I hate the breeders! We drink to that. Wichita and the Wild. Where were you, kid? Take a drink. No, thank you. Come on, sir. I think he does not like cowboys. Of course, if everyone likes you. He can not drink like you, that's all. If I resist alcohol. Take us at Bar Keno. Clint, we are too old to drink all night. Maybe you're right. Let's go home. Mary prepared you a room. You know, Sam? The Mary a woman is very hospitable. How are you, sir? What time is it, Bat? 20 midnight. It will soon begin. Do you think they will sow the mess in Wichita? Take note of the paper and all the details as you can. Gyp! - Gyp Clemens! - I arrive. What is the matter? Taste it. I like it. No, it tastes horrible. You're right. It's disgusting. Alcohol is adulterated, guys! We need fresh air! What's going on? You'll soon find out. Stay inside until everything is finished. Make her sit down. Call a physician. - There is no doctor in Wichita. - I know a little. Bring towels and water. It does not matter. - Well ... - What, well? Give me your badge. You are mad, you do no time will stand out. Give it to me! - You have a gun? - A gun? You heard. I have one. Go get him. One moment, Wyatt. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to defend the law of the United States and this community? - I swear. - I called Sheriff of Wichita. It's a dead man. There remain 20. Others have fallen horse or left. They will continue until too tired or hungry to gallop. Which may last until morning. Mr. Whiteside, look! Hey, boys! Look who is! And he wears a badge brand new! Hey Gyp! Where are you? Here. I have two loads of buckshot pointed at you. At this distance, I can remove 5. What are you playing? I play to stop. Tell them to throw their weapons. You have ten seconds. Un Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Sept. Eight. Throw it out, guys, He was not joking! Maire. Open the prison, I stopped. - You make a mistake. - You will die for it. Take your men in prison. Let the horses tied. - Listen ... - You are all arrested. Forward. Listen. I'll take my gun ... - ... and we will ... - No. You're under arrest. Really? So come on, help yourself a gun. Only in this way take me to jail. Bat! Take this and cover the men. If one of them moves, shoot. No need to aim. I do not want to kill you, Clemens. Now or never. Turn around and goes to prison. Keep your gun. Ah, yes. - Thank you. - Nothing. - Good evening, Mr. Mayor. - Wyatt. The trial will take place at ten o'clock. I need your testimony. Good. I'll be there. - What should I do about them? - I do not know, it's your job. I can only condemn in fines. Well, do it, and I will make them leave the city. There are many people who will not like that. And you? This may be a bit harsh. - Good night. - Good night, Wyatt. Good morning. You have enclosed my men? - Yes. - For what reason? - Disturbances of public order. - "Disturbing public order"? I pay their fines and you make them out. They have to die of thirst. Judging will take place at 10 am. You can pay then. I pay now they spent enough time there. I'm sorry, Mr. Wallace. In 10 hours. There are only 3 hours. See you soon. Listen! Maybe you do not understand. I will speak clearly. I want them free for 10 minutes. If they are not in the street, we will destroy you with the prison. Of calm. You will not come, because you will be in prison. For threats against an officer of the law. Tell your friends free. Judging will take place at 10 am. You can attend. I'll kill the first trying to escape. Questions? Well Questions? By this, Mr. Wallace. I do not want more problems, Mr. Wallace. Lets through. You're a dead man. Thou art conscious? - Hello. - Hello, Mr. McCoy. I'm glad you accepted the job. What made you change your mind? Well, several things. I saw you in action yesterday. How you handled these men is admirable Thank you. What you do make them pay fines? This is the case of the mayor. The trial will take place at ten o'clock. If you'll excuse me, I'll take my breakfast. Sheriff. You stopped Clint Wallace? Exact. Why? It did not take part disorders of the night. I stopped to avoid problems. He wanted to free his men. He was not speaking seriously. Surely not. He only wanted to bluff you. I do not think so. In any case, I would not risk more violence. Wyatt. You do not think of one thing. Wichita depends on these breeders. Men like Wallace and cowboys. They are important to us. Occasionally, they make noise but we must make concessions. I do not agree, McCoy. Not when there is damage and the dead. Somebody died tonight? - Of the city? - Yes. Who? His name was Michael Jackson. It was 5 years old. - And do not come back! - Who do you take? I'm the Sheriff and I do not want see these men here. Me too? No, neither you nor those have fired that night. Here is your weapons. Come. Thank you, Bat. This also applies to residents. I want to be your assistant. It would take me a year older than you. Who? Good question. I know no one else here. I'll call some friends. Meanwhile, ... ... the job is yours. You know you use this? I know shoot but I'm still not fast. Do not try. If you must use them as, you have to fly the first time. Yes, sir. Come, I will procure a badge and we will put up posters everywhere. FIREARMS ARE PROHIBITED IN THE STREETS OF WICHITA I believe in what you do, but I do not know if this is the right solution. However there is no other, Mr. Whiteside. Unarmed, they can not is shot. It's that simple. This measure will not make you popular. Without guns, people are defenseless. As you watch over their safety. You know I did not want of this work. But you accepted and you will. Bat and I are with you. I read your editorial. It is a consolation to know we are not alone. A newspaper is a little more a consolation. It should guide public opinion, exert influence. But it takes time, Mr. Whiteside. How long have you, Wyatt? - What it takes. - Good. Take it. Thank you for your support. Both of them. It is a pleasure and a privilege, Sheriff. I think it will get there if they leave him alone. - "They," the cowboys? - No, citizens. What will happen to Wichita when it is known that there is a Sheriff crazy? I can tell you. It will be a ghost town. No breeder will come to a city which can not carry weapons. - We need to ... - Hi, Doc, John, Andrew. - Sam, you must do something. - I know it's why I called. Andrew, talk to him. Tell him that he exaggerates. It is not the type to which they say how do its job. It does so in its own way or it does not. - I think it's good. - What do you say? We need a good sheriff. You agree. Sam, we can all be ruined ... ... If you can not stop the Sheriff. Much money has been invested in this city into a center of cattle. And if the farmers do not? And they will not believe me. What will become of us? - What will transport your train? - Doc, it's not as bad. Not yet, anyway. Here's what we will do. We will invite the Sheriff a ceremony. We will explain the situation. Maybe he did not understand. It's a good idea, Sat And if it does not work? It gets rid of him. Andrew was recruited, Andrew return it. That simple. Even the cake, Sheriff? No, thank you, ma'am. I thought the country people had an appetite. Out of town. You should see me in a picnic. - I would like. - Tomorrow, then? The new Sheriff do not waste time. Ladies, we take coffee while the men are smoking? Do you like fried chicken? Let's drink to Wichita. Although the children. - Come see the guest. - Certainly. It is our pleasure to hear that, if they are not empty words. I do not know if I understand you. Listen, we are business people. Citizens of Wichita. We can say that we ... ... Represent the city. Okay? - Up to a point. - That is to say? No one can represent a city ... ... If he was not elected by citizens. And the only elected here Hope is the mayor. It's true. Andrew, you should talk to Wichita. Good idea, Andrew. Cards on the table, Wyatt. This group, which is as a city council ... Believes that your reforms are too severe. I see. I guess it is the prohibition of weapons. Of course. It is a mistake. Men sometimes freely choose to leave their guns at home. But that day has not arrived yet. In Wichita, if As Sheriff I would. - It can get better. - One moment, Doc. Enervon does not. Wyatt. We know you act in good faith. Whether your interest in Wichita is sincere. It's just that you do not see the business side, that's all. - You have to recognize it. - Yes, I admit. I know that depends Wichita cattle and cowboys. - It is a growing city. - No. That's not it. She is tall, it grows and we hope to grow with it. But we need farmers. Remember that I did not applied for that position. You have offered me and I refused. I changed my mind tonight and you know why. Now I am committed. I will not change in method and I will not give up. It will remove me. As Doc said there is a time ... - ... It can be arranged. - Well, fix it. Well, Andrew, go ahead. Sheriff! Sheriff! My gun, please. Who and where, Bat? Cowboys from those of W that you stopped yesterday. They are in the Texas House. So, Mr. Mayor? So what, Sheriff? - Andrew, you have committed ... - Calm down, calm. Well, Andrew. it can be done tomorrow. The Clemens are in town. Although they will be solve it themselves. The Sheriff does not seem want to come. He will come. A large W. - What you gonna do? - Look at this. Hands in the air. Raise them! I will not bother to stop this time. - What was there, Sheriff? - Shut up! No one can pay one hundred dollars. I told you not to return As I am the Sheriff. If I see you again here, I kill you. Now, get out! Not now. We will return. Do not come back. I told you what would happen. If you had wanted to kill us, why you did not. You have had the opportunity. I do not want, Gyp. Do not make me. It was you who roast the chicken? Of course it's me. - And the cake too. - I'm impressed Well, I do not know why. The kitchen is made of 90% by women in that country. - Who taught you? - My mother. It is the habit, you know. Apparently you're interested little girls. It would have interested if there were more like you. You do not lose time, eh, Wyatt? Before, time did not seem not important. Now if and I do not want lose a minute. We should leave. FIREARMS ARE PROHIBITED IN THE STREETS OF WICHITA What do you take? Whiskey. You have not seen the posters? No revolvers. We know read. Doc, you expect from gunmen Grand W? Yes, for several days, they arrived? It seems. Two types of drive type that does are not separated from their artillery. Tell them to enter. The leader wants to talk. - What? - I do not know. He is there. - What do we owe you? - The house calls. Did you hear? This place will please us. Welcome to Wichita. Doc I'm Black. You are not in tune with the times, with guns in this town, huh? Really? This is Wallace, Grand W, sent you? By the way, my friend. You wanted to see us here. That's good. I pay 1000 dollars to do a job. It will use that. Are you interested? It interests us. I thought. You have drawn attention. If the Sheriff sees you, you will remove the before you can use them. I doubt it. Here's the money. I will give when it's done. Do not think that I try to teach you your job ... ... But I know better the situation. Go ahead. First, ... ... One of you must remain hidden. - Sam, please. - I'm sorry, honey. I have to stop this before it goes too far. But why? Why can not you resolve your differences ... ... without involving Laurie? She likes him. They are all against him, not just me. It can not end only one way I do not want Laurie either side of him at that time. The do you want? - Hi, Dad. We ... - Between, Laurie. We'll talk later. - But, Dad ... - I beg you. - Good evening, Wyatt. - Goodbye, Laurie. I ask not to see my daughter. You understand why, right? - Yes, I understand. - Sheriff! - There is a gunslinger. - Who is it? I do not know, but it is a revolver. He saw the posters. Is he alone? Yes. He sits and drinks. All right. Excuse me. It happens. Hi, Wyatt. Morgan. So you, the great gunslinger? - Where is Jim? - Hi, Wyatt. I bring you a good customer. You know him? Yes, I know. What did he do? He has offered $ 1000 to kill you. If they are friends to you, tell them that the joke is over. I have never seen. I believe you, Doc, but they are not friends. They are my brothers. Very clever. - Well, you already know my position. - Here, you run out of position. You have one hour to leave Wichita. - Help him for luggage. - Certainly. Goodbye. Tell your brother that I will return. In your place I will not. Never. Well, let's go. We can reach the dark. And if Earp is not in the street? It will be. It is a round looking for problems. It will be on the street or the newspaper. Perhaps tonight there or elsewhere. Then we come back tomorrow. Remember, we will cross the city slowly. It will be too dark to that we recognize. If we do not see, we return to the other side. Let's go. - Hello, Miss McCoy. - Hello. The Sheriff and there? - Yes, I'll call. - Thank you. Ah, Sheriff, I would pick you up. Good evening. I went home. I know. Dad called you. Wyatt, what there was between you two? It does not tell you? He only said not to see you. Why? A difference of opinion of Wichita. This is an explanation rather short. It's long to explain and I do not have time. Wyatt ... ... which of you is right? This is not to be right, but what is right. Promise me that there will no problems. I beg you, Promise me. Come, I'll ride. - Hi, Andrew. - Hello, Mary. Give me your hat. Leave him a hand. I will not stay long. What will happen, Andrew? I've never seen so irritated Sat as against the Sheriff. - Why he hates so much? - It is not hatred. It's not as simple. It is there. Good evening, Sat Good evening, Andrew. And your Sheriff? It happens. You know why I called you, right? Yes, Sam, I know. So you know what you do. - Yes, I know. - Good. Sit down, Andrew. Tell him to take his brothers with him. I want them out by tomorrow morning. No, Sat - What? - I can not. I see. We will also need of a new mayor! It's possible. Perhaps the citizens are in agreement. You can be sure. Well, we'll see. It is 7 or 8 months for the elections. You have time to look another candidate. We will make special elections. It is I who am the mayor. I was the only candidate, Sat I do not even need program. Now I have one. The law and order. Good evening, Sheriff. You wanted me to talk about Black Doc? Yes. How can you believe ... ? I did not have to be accountable for expelling Doc Black in Wichita. - Listen ... - I've heard enough. I have a job to do and I will. I will enforce the law and I will deal my way those who violate. - You understand. - I'm not Black Doc. You can not threaten me. You are an ordinary citizen, no special privilege. I see. Well, next time I go out ... I would have a gun. I'll wait. Sorry, Laurie. Sheriff, please. There is no other way? I'm afraid not, ma'am. There he is! Sam! Bring the horses. - Mary! - Mom! Mary! Yes, three horses. - Come on, do not stop. - What is your problem? Pull Wyatt Earp. Without it, others do not count. We need fresh horses to continue. Do not worry. It will be another day. - How are you, Jim? - It does not matter. It is in the shoulder. Back to Wichita to wait for those of W. Grand Do you think they will? They will come, yes. We killed two of their men. Hello, Sheriff. How will Miss McCoy and his father? Hello, Wyatt. Miss Laurie, I bring you breakfast? No, thank you, William. Laurie, I can do something? No. But thank you for coming. I'm sorry. Wyatt! She has never hurt anyone! I know, I know. - You come back? - Yes. You must be tired and hungry. I'll cook. Thank you. But I want to talk with your father. He does not want to see anybody. It is with my mother since last night. I have to say can wait. It will make furious but it might do him good. Maybe. It has to do with that shot? Yes. We had two. The third escaped. This is where someone your father's trust. - Who? - Black Doc. But it was our friend! I know. It is not complete, is not it? No, not yet. Now you know why your father does not want to be seen. Too many people I shoot. - But you will not give up. - No. Never give up. Not as things like that happen. It might take me a lifetime. And mine. Because I will be with you. Come. I bring you your breakfast. They started shooting at us when he saw us. They did not given the opportunity to travel. Sure my brother is dead? Sure. And the other. They have put their more than ten bullets. I go to Wichita. Anyone would come? Chief, he killed two of us. He was murdered. You will let him get away?
