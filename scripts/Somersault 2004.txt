Walking around naked and drunk at three o'clock in the morning - that's an accident? Yes. You can pack your things and go. I need the room back. Why, is your son getting out ofjail? (Gasps) What? Is he getting out? No. He won't be getting out... for a very long time. He must've done something really bad, then. Yes, he did. What? What did he do? He killed a man. He walked into a 7-Eleven and shot a young man in the stomach. Is that what you wanted to know? (Sniffs and sobs quietly) (Sobs) POIGNANT MUSIC (Hums) BELL TINKLES I just wanted to say thank you for everything. That's alright. Here's the key. Yeah, thanks. My mum's not dead. What?! (Tearfully) She's not dead. I make stuff up, and before I came here I did something really, really bad. I kissed my mum's boyfriend. And she looked at me... ...she looked at me like she didn't know who I was anymore. I'm really sorry, Irene. She knows you. She knows you. I think we should ring your mum. Hmm? She wouldn't want to see me. (Sighs) No matter what you've done, love... ...your mum will want to see you. Tell me the number. What's your mum's first name? Nicole. It's, um... BITTERSWEET MUSIC Hi. Can I come in? You've packed up. Yeah. Where are you going? Home. My mum's coming. That's good. I think it's good that we met. See you. Heidi. BITTERSWEET MUSIC (Whispers) I missed you, sweetie.
