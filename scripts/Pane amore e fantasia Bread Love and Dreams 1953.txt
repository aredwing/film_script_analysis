But under every uniform there is of course, a man. As such, they feel love and suffering like all of us But when their humanity goes beyond the limits of disciplinary rules, yet they know how to recover, as in the tradition which is the bright Corps patrimony. I am sergeant Squinzi, how do you do Sir? I am sergeant Carotenuto. A pleasure Sir. - Thank you. Thank you Sir. Corporal Bolognini. I am sergeant major Carotenuto. It's a pleasure. Corporal Sampieri Guiseppe, Sir. Re-listed. I am sergeant major Carotenuto. Private Baiocchi Siro, son of Antonino, re-listed. - Your civilian occupation? - Student. - Which class? - Fifth, Sir. - I continued studies on my own. - I see. And you? Private Stelluti Pietro, son of Giuseppe. This is my first enlistment, sergeant. - Civilian experience? - Farming. I assisted my father. - Bravo. Tell me the village? - Up there. Quite a climb. Ah, always those mountains! Oh yes, mountains! - Are we ready? - Yes Sir. Stelluti! - What has he tied to his luggage? - It looks like a guitar. A sergeant with a guitar should be a pretty good man. Coming around the curve. Tell me something. How many people are there in Saliegna? plus a few hundred on the outskirts. - And the crime rate? - Very low. You will stay like a pope! Let's hope all goes well. In Romagne it was terrible. Rough assignment? Murderous. But still the country is rich and nobody starves. - And beautiful women! - Have you been there? - I met my wife there. - How does she like living here? - Pretty well Sir. - No! It's hard to believe you. When we are send to a place like this, you should take it like a honeymoon. What else one does at night? Here, they go to sleep with the chickens. When does your wife arrive? I am a bachelor. The marshal looks angry. - His face darkened. - If he is crabby then we are fine. Go, Barro! - Hello sergeant. - Hello Fantassine. - Need some wood? - Ask Caramella. Our maid and yours as well. Caramella? Beautiful name. Go, Barro! - What a beauty! - She's a real devil too. - Prostitute? - No, just a little wild. - Subversive? - No. Devil in the flesh through poverty. They have given her the nickname "Fantassine the hot bird". They are arriving! - Bombardment? - No, an earthquake. Over there. - Earthquake? - No, bombardment. - Good morning, Marshal. - Good morning. Now we need a brass band. What are they looking at? Here everybody always looks at everybody. - Eases up investigations. - Yes! - Where are the barracks? - Far away, at the church square. - There is the mayor. - Good morning. - You must be the new... I am the mayor. - My pleasure. - I go with you. - Thanks. This night you will sleep here. There is no hotel in the village. We leave early tomorrow and the house will be all yours. - Perfect. - You want some vermouth? Yes please. That's the maid? Caramella? No, I would like to introduce you to my wife. Excuse me madame. I'm mortified. - Never mind. - Marshal major Carotenuto. No, thanks. It is better to be married here, or you'll risk nuisance. - At my age. - You must be kidding! Giulia, the marshal says he is too old to get married. - Don't say that! - You are too good. You must have had success with the ladies. You are the archetypical seducer. Isn't it? She is right. - A cigarette? - No thanks. I smoke, but here, I had to quit. Lots of gossip in the village. - Old fashions. - They are medieval here! Here she is. our Caramella. Good evening. - Marshal. - Thank you. She worked half time for us. Half time, yes. Full time for me. What you want, sir. Annarella! For heaven's sake, Annarella, hurry up! - What? - Come quick! I see, it's Caramella. Are you boiling water? Everything is ready since last night. - Perfect. I'm coming. - Quick, or it comes out. Not without me. Come on. Good morning, Annarella. You are up early today. Like the church bells, I sound at every hour. - Fantassine in the offing. - We are on duty. Alright, I will look for you. What is it? - Where do you go? - I will come back. - What about the laundry? - I said I'll come back! Have you seen a black and white chicken? Me, no. And you, Stelluti? Arrest it when you find it! Where you go? Let me pass through. - Why between us? - For it brings good luck. For you, but for us it brings bad luck. But if Stelluti agrees... Let's go. Thanks. She was looking for you, not the chicken. Are you asleep? Baiocchi, don't talk about that chick anymore. Stop making fun of me, or I will get angry. You are right, I understand: true feelings have to be respected. It is true, true feelings... I am crazy in love with that chick, but I cannot talk to her, not a single word or... a transfer... I don't want. If I go away, I risk making mistakes. I have to be careful. Listen, Fantassine understood that you...? - What...? - How, what? - You are not in love? - Oh yes, she understood quickly. - And she? - I don't know. She is so weird sometimes. And I still have 20 months to wait. And me! Three more years and my fiancee is in Val d'Aosta! Duty, and nothing but duty: that's the life of a Carabiniere. Fantassine, are you going to confession? I'd like to be your confessor. Do you have ribbons? For you I have everything, come. Wait. Nothing nice over here, but if you come after Mass, after closing time, I'll take them for you at the warehouse. - Stop it and show me those ribbons. - I would donate you the whole store. Come back here and I'll show you a cloth. If your wife hears you she will kill you. Fantassine, you will be my death. Very good, we will give you a nice funeral. Fantassine, beware of him. I am going to hunt today. Are you coming with me? The other day's slap didn't suffice? Want another one? Nazionali cigaretes. - Give it to me. - No, it's mine. Nazionali, please. Wait a moment. - Good morning Marshal. - Good morning. You don't know me? I deliver wood to the Carabinieri. - Fantassine hot chick. - Yes, that's how they call me. - I want to give you this goldfinch. - To me? Yes, you're alone. It will keep you company Thanks. Sampieri! I wish you well. At your service. Bring this goldfinch to my room. One moment, parishioners. A notice. Again this year, we are making a pilgrimage to Saint Acuto. Let me remind you, it is not an entertainment nor a picnic. Your souls need to be maidenlike. Clean, I would say. Thus, immerse your dirty souls in the lye of penance, soap it with contrition, shake it out like you shake out your laundry near the river, rinse it with the waters of prayer, spread it out in the sun of our Lord Jesus Christ and iron it with the flat-iron of good promises. Without creases! Don Emidio knows how to do laundry! Did you see the marshal smiling at Fantassine? He likes kidding. - May I? - Enter. - I am the new commander - I know. Get seated! - Father, here's the coffee. - One more cup of coffee please. - You want a cup of coffee? - Yes please, I love it. I never go out without my espresso maker. A good cup of coffee always does good. - Here you go. - Thanks. You shook it, it's full of grounds. But I brought like the Blessed Sacrament! We will settle this later. Go now. I came to you Monsignor... Monsignor to me... I am just a poor priest. - Excuse me, I'm unfamiliar. with titles - Are you from Naples? - Almost, I'm from Sorrento. - That's why. You Neapolitans say Sir to everyone. Yes, but there are ways and means. Anyway, thanks for your courtesy. And your visit above all. - My duty. - I know that you're unmarried. Yes, unmarried. Marshal, this is a village that offers no distraction. It's a quiet village. No strikes, no rebellion. - You would like a rebellion? - No, what's the point? When I read in newspapers that in Puglia or in Sicily the farmers are rebellious, go on strike on their lands, I almost cry because at least they have hope. But here, since more than 50 years the land belongs entirely to peasants so, nothing could happen anymore. It's a village of progress. Yes, the progress of misery. I have been here more than 40 years and I swear that it takes lots of strength to confess these poor folks. Here we live deceiving ourselves of living. Maybe providence has decided that this village must disappear. And we are dying little by little, day after day, without realizing it. By the way, father... are there often earthquakes here? I saw ruins. A little shock each year, without serious consequences, and a big one every And when was the last big one? Quite a while ago. It's about time. This year or the next we will dance. Good. I have to go. - This marshal takes the priest for a jinx. - Why? He made the sign of horns while the priest spoke. But he's the cuckold! Hurry up! - Have a good sunday, marshal. - Good sunday. - What are you eating? - Bread. - With what? - With fantasy, marshal. - Bon apetit. - Thanks. Fantassine! Do you want to buy these plums I picked for you? - For me? - Yes, for you. - Why? - Because i like you. Are you engaged? Yes and no. - What do you mean? - You ask too many questions. - Well, do you want them? - Yes, how much is it? Give what you like. Is 50 lires okay? Yes, it's okay to me. Make it 100. - Bring them to the barracks. - Right now. Good morning. - Thief! Give me back my plums! - Be careful about how you speak. Give me back my plums. You stole them from my orchard. - That's what you say. - I recognize them! Your fruit is marked like sheep? Thief! There is the chief of thieves Who is, who is? I know but I don't say or you put me in a jail. Thief! I feel bad. Take it easy, it's nothing against you! Peppa, I'll die soon! Just perish, just perish... What... do you want? It's for the marshal. The marshal is out, come back later. The marshal bought them and told me to bring them here. All right. What's your name? Stelluti Pietro, son of Giuseppe. My name is Maria. Maria de Ritis daughter of the late Giovanni. Nice meeting you. I'll give you the basket? I will come back to get it... tomorrow. Perfect. As you wish. Tomorrow. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Good morning. - Good morning. - My regards, Donna Annarella. - My regards, Marshal. - Going for a walk? - I always walk. I had to help at a parturition in Selvone. There's no end to this place, all those hamlets! As you say. You don't have transport? I have a mule sometimes, otherwise I walk. - A beautiful lady like you! - That's how it goes. - May I? - With pleasure. - Have you been here a long time? - Seven years, since graduation. - My God, and how did you survive? - It's like that. I feel so lonely and lost. It's always like that, in the beginning. But you'll get used to it. People are friendly. I am a social man, no family though, I was made for family. - Is it your fault? - Apparently, Donna Annarella. You don't know our life... Until being promoted, a carabiniere cannot be married. It's hard. If I tell you about my life, you won't believe me. I had other aspirations. I feel being an artist. I would love to study music, the mandolin. I play guitar a little. Or I'd like to have a perfumery. Noble and gentle wares. And here I am instead, a carabiniere. Madonna knows how much I suffer in becoming a marshal: Service, discipline, heat, cold, rain, whole nights, gunshots. My poor feet made many miles. My shoulders are hardened by the strap of the rifle. I've been so much in service that all together it adds up to over four years. Four years of my life with the rifle on the shoulder. Anyway... Marshal, we're almost there. - You're right. Too bad. - It's better if we separate. - Gossip will travel quick. - You are right. Thanks for your good company. It's me who should say thanks. See you soon, I hope. Sure. - We are the only strangers. - Oh, yes. I already feel close with you. - It makes me like. - Really? When you can cheer up someone, it's always a delight. And I feel so much relieved. Goodbye. Goodbye. The sergeant declared his love to her. Now he goes away. - And Annarella? - She sighs. You made me call, Don Emidio? Yes, you! Come over here. Close the door. What have you done this time? We are already in countless troubles. I know, but the plums of Concezio... Answer. He has come complaining to me. - It's him who steals many! - Quiet. He steals many. He steals from the municipality, the poor people, from everyone. You know that. He will end up in hell. Don Emilio, you know, Concezio is cunning. On his deathbed, he will have you up if he confesses and repents, he will get absolution and go to paradise. I will send him, but God judges. But the poor folks, Don Emilio, already live in a hell. And they stay in hell because they curse, steal and despair Come to church. Always the same story. Here, people are wasting themselves only in prayers. If you want fruit you can take them from my orchard. I will obey, but ask the saints some grace for me. I pray for you every day. You know that I mind my own business. But I have a bad reputation. Is it my fault that men walk after me? If I would still have my father, or a big brother, the bad tongues would be silenced quickly... I know. But if someone truly loves you, send him to me, your confessor. I will tell him how good and clean you are. - No, no. - Let God bless you, Don Emidio. Caramella. What do your compatriots say about the new marshal? - That you appear to be a good man. - Thank goodness! They think you're nice. Yes? Who says so? The people. But who precisely? The people. Which people? What, "which people"? The people. I remember that the midwife said she liked you. You have heard it yourself? With my own ears. And she said it in that tone... "I find this marshal very very likable!" She exactly said: "very very likable"? "Very, but very, very". I like her too, very very. Caramella! - Who is it? - It's me. Can I come in? I'm coming. - Who is it? - The midwife's maid. Yes? Annarella asks if you have the railroad timetable for her. - Of course, here it is. - Thanks and good night. What does she wants? Annarella wants to check the timetable of the trains, to search connections. - Where to? - To Rome. To Rome? - For how long? - Two or three days, as usual. "As usual"? Annarella goes to Rome almost every month or so. Last time she just returned before your arrival. Clean the table. - You don't eat? - No, I'm not hungry. Caramella, do you know why Annarella goes to Rome? It is a big secret. Seven years here already and nobody figured her out. I only know one thing: Every time she returns, she is radiant. What do you mean? When a young lady obtains certain satisfactions, her face illuminates, her eyes get sweet, and her voice very calm. I understand. If you would have seen her as I did, you would lose your rank, marshal. - Explain. - As you know, there is no bathroom in the village and Annarella is very clean. She takes baths in a tub. She's a real lady. One evening, her maid was ill I helped her with bathing. And you saw her... Sure! A real beauty! A masterwork of Mother Nature. Spring blossom. She dived. Her breasts, high up and smooth. A thin waist and a pair of legs... two columns. Okay, go to sleep now. Good night. You're in a bad mood tonight, aren't you? Hurry up, come on! Come! Take care of the donkey, it is all we have. If Don Concezio comes, don't let him in. Block the door with a table tonight. - Keep tranquil, go. - We will be praying all night. Saint Antony will see our troubles. You should also pray to Saint Antony all night like us. Sure, so tomorrow instead of searching strawberries I fall asleep! Go quietly now. - Hey beauty, where are they going? - On a pilgrimage to Mount Acuto. - Bad luck! - Why? - I arrive and my clients go. - They return tomorrow. I will lose a day of revenue. - Will you take me to the village? - Come and take a look. - I don't have money - We make a deal. But I don't have a single penny! - Well awakened. - Good morning. - You slept well? - No, very bad. What are you going to do with these paper women? You're right, but what can I do... - She left. - Sure. Today she will be radiant. - Do you want to shave? - No. - Shave, you look old. - I don't care anymore. Good morning, Fantassine! - Good morning, marshal! - Not on a pilgrimage? Who is on my donkey then? - He's lucky, your donkey. - Why? His owner has seven beauties. - And 77 misfortunes. - Are you looking for me? No, I'm picking up something. May I? Good morning madame. I'm picking up my basket. - Your mother took it last night. - I beg you pardon. Madame! Can I tell you something? - Will it take long? - No. Is it true that a sergeant mother is coming to pay a visit to him? The one they call "the statue"? - Yes, it's him! - Why? Are you interested? Yes. But he never says anything, he's like a nun! But I know that he loves me. When he sees me, he looks thunderstruck! - Okay, so his mother... - Of course, she comes from Trentino to see her children and stay for the celebration. Do you know where she will stay? - No. - At Don Emidio's. And know why? The archbishop of Trentino wrote to Don Emidio if he could find a room for her parishioner. Don Emidio immediately offered his house. - Very good. - And now, Paoletta, the priest's niece, is going crazy and ordered two dresses to a Pescara seamstress. And you know what they say? - She will marry the sergeant. - Who said so? The people. It's not possible. Listen to me, forget that sergeant. I love him very much. Believe me, forget him. It's impossible. It's gossip! What gossip? I smell a marriage like a dog smells a hare. I'm sorry. Don't make that face. You are the prettiest of the country, you'll find your spouse. Goodbye. Fantassine! Your goldfinch sings like a tenor. Lucky him. Caramella, I'm going to shave! The marshal likes Fantassine so much! - Me too, I like her. - You? As soon as she saw me she ran away. She will drive you crazy. You better forget about her. I can't. - Fantassine! - Who is it? It's me. - Did I frighten you? - A little bit. - I apologize. - It's all right. I came to visit you but nobody was home. They are on a pilgrimage. Oh yes, you said it. Aren't you afraid here, all alone? Nobody steals from me. A beautiful girl like you, alone at night. The opportunity makes the thief. Have a sergeant guard me. - I'll take you by your word. - Just take it. Okay, I'll send a guard tonight. Thank you, Sir. Saint Antony! I have to put up with that too! - What? - Mother's dress! Get it! Thanks. And from what? You're all wet. I'm sorry. A bit of water won't hurt me. - Leave me, I have to dry myself. - Yes, me too. Go dry yourself in the wood. In the wood, under the leaves? How poetic. Take care, Fantassine. Dry yourself well. Go into the wood. - Tonight, I will send a guard. - Thank you, Sir. Go on now! Take a look, it's free. You are in lady's paradise. Buy, search, look. Sunday is the celebration! Buy a dress and conquer a husband. No, no. French style. - In other words? - With the point of the scissors. My beauty, I told you we could arrange something. Who gives me money! Fabric from Como, very special! - How much is this dress? - For you, 5000 lire. - Give it to me. - Is it yours? - Yes, I'm buying it. - Are you selling your donkey? Ugly, capricious bitch. Little idiot! - Capricious, me? What about you then? - I am what? - What do you know? - What everyone say. - What everyone say? Bad tongues! - Are you crazy? This dress comes from Paris! What are you doing? Please, calm down! Are you going to stop? - Refusal of an order? - Mind your own business! What's going on? Nothing, just a dispute. - What is it? - Marshal, these two seem possessed! Take them to the barracks. Hurry up. Did you see Fantassine? She gets prettier when she fights. She is always beautiful. This Fantassine... What type is she? The type who makes do. Otherwise how can she make a living? She arranges with everybody? Everybody and nobody. She is sly, it's hard to catch her red-handed. And who enjoys don't speak. You know how it goes in the village. Are you sure? Ask anyone you want. - Quickly. - There you go. What a dishonor! Two beautiful girls fighting with each other for nothing. What will the people say? What a disgrace to our village! - She started it! - Me? I'll kill you! Don't you touch me! Keep calm! Silence! - Caramella! Go out. - Yes, Sir. Let's hear what's happened. Silence! Stelluti, I am listening. - I arrived after Baiocchi. - Baiocchi? When I arrived they were shouting and fighting like crazy. I stopped as soon as you told me to. But you continued to insult her. Because she insulted me! Why didn't you tell that she insulted? Insulted me? I don't remember. I heard nothing. She was resisting you and tore off your jacket! Liar! She tore my dress off, the only one that I own! Stelluti, what happened? I'm sure it was an accident. One can't stop women who are fighting... Ok, then. Honest girls are always wrong. You hear that? You dirty little hypocrite. I'll wait you outside! - What I said? - Tonight you'll be back home on a gurney! - Calm down. - I will kill her. - Put her in the lock-up. - You can't arrest me. Not arresting. Just detaining to save you from jail. I don't care about jail but she must go to the cemetery. Put her in! Tomorrow morning Don Emidio will take care of his niece. Stelluti, come! You, don't touch me! I don't want him to touch me! I don't want him to touch me! From a niece of Emidio I expected a little more gentleness. I am good and smooth, but when they provoke me... That's the way I am. Did she calm down? Who? She is a wild devil. - Bring me the traveling salesman. - Yes, sir. - May I? - Come on in. - Your identification? - Here you go. Identity card and vendor's license. You may go. - Are you from Sorrento? - Very much. - Me too. - Really, marshal? Everything is in order. You may sit down, please. Then we should know each other. I'm a son of Ciccillo the coral seller, opposite the tobacco store. I remember very well! I am a son of Marietta Sartori, related to Scognamiglio. - From the furniture factory? - Yes, that's right. A Sartori, sister of my mother, is married to a Scognamiglio. I remember your mother. A true lady. Mother was a saint. She raised six children. Babbo, the poor... - Who is that? - Babbo... Daddy! Daddy. Daddy died when we were kids. I went into service at 17. And I am nailed here, for 4 years! Do you realize it? I sympathize with all my heart. We can't do anything here, not even a look at a lady and all the village knows. You have to be as a fox. Nevertheless women here get it quickly: A glance or a gesture is enough. - You think so? - With that rosebud... - It's easy. - Which rosebud? Fantassine. You're rambling. She's a prisoner. She is sacred, untouchable. Today yes, but tomorrow? Fantassine is a beautiful girl, and with a 5000 lire dress you do it on a whim. - With my grey hair... - Even more attractive. It makes you look serious. Don Vincenza, see you soon. At your service, marshal. You know where to find me. The dove sings. I once wanted him But not any more Whom shall I give my heart? I don't know for now But for sure, I'll never give it to a traitor no more. But for sure, I'll never give it to a traitor no more... - Did you listen? - What? - The song. - It's not for me. You think so? She calls you a traitor. Me? - Yes, you. - I can't believe that. You are really stupid! I don't understand it at all. She's angry with me. What have I done to her? What does she want from me? - What does that devil want? - Don't call her devil. I'll beg you. She is a poor child. All right, if you insist. But you have to decide. Talk, write, do something. I will write her. Quick, or you'll end up in an asylum. You understand? The sun of love. Tell me whom my heart thinks of. Tell me where is the husband that I like. Sun of fire. Sun of love. Tell me where is the husband that I like Sun of fire. Sun of love. Marshal! - What? - Just a word. Silence. Sleep. I can't. It is important. - What's the matter? - Stay there. Open up. - Marshal. - Please be quiet. You need to take care of the donkey. What for? It's our only fortune and it's alone. Am I supposed to keep it company? No, he is thirsty and hungry. Send a rifleman, they have nothing to do here. You called me for this? I remembered the donkey and thought of you. Be aware that, if he gets sick, you have to pay. Send a rifleman quick, it can't suffer because of you. Go now. Go. Sleepless night? Not used yet to go to bed with the chickens. - So you are a cock! - Good night, Don Vincenzo. Sweet dreams. Slow. Stop! Come on, drink. Stop! Slow. That's enough. Go ahead. Bon apetit. Go. Come out. Good morning. Did Don Emidio return? Yes, early this morning for the mass. Good. Enter. I have to hurry. I hurry but promise me to not make any trouble. - I have too many troubles. - Is your anger over now? Yes, over. The poor are always to blame. You offend me. I did not prove you wrong. I did it for you, just for you. If I had let you free yesterday, you would've done something stupid. Do I have reason? Yes. If you see Paoletta, don't look at her, and change your course. Promised? Promised. It's okay. You have to know that I like you a lot. Thank you, sir. Good morning, marshal! Donna Annarella! - Good morning. - Welcome back. - I will give you the train tables. - Whenever you like. - Thanks again! - You're welcome. So heavy! You played the lovesick with Annarella and now you treat her badly? A lovesick, me? This village has imagination. Forget about imagination. Did you take care of my donkey? - Of course. - May I go? Take care, Fantassine. We will see. - See you there. - Where do you go? Going home and to the forest to find wood and strawberries if I find them. All right. I will whistle when I pass by. - Am I a dog? - So to speak. To say hello. You don't want me to say hello? Sure you can. Say it. You see her? I don't. Wait until she turn the corner. - Here she is. I recognize her before you! - You are right. That's her. - Take out your letter? - It's here. Get it out. And come on, a bit of courage. You saw that? Sure I did. What have you done? - I don't know. - You never know anything. Fantassine, where are you? Come on in. Fantassine is out. Go to sleep. You walked all night. - Mommy, I'm hungry. - Who sleeps dines. Go to sleep. Mommy, I'm tired. - Go to bed, quick. - Come here. Mommy! Look! Where did you find it? - There, on the ground. - On the ground? Saint Antony! Lord, Jesus, Maria! Mommy, what are you doing? Saint Antony, were it you? A miracle! Look my child. A miracle! Mommy, did you go crazy? My child, Saint Antony gave me a blessing. - Look. - Who gave you that? - Saint Antony. - Be rational, mommy. - Don't touch! It is sacred. - Don't say that. Reflect! I'll do that. You heard anything last night? I wasn't there. I'll explain. You weren't there? Miracle! Saint Antony made you sleep out on purpose, you understand? - Marshal. - Who is it? - Marshal. - What is it? Where are you? But what has happened? We came running here because there is agitation in the village. - For what reason? - Maria De Ritis... - Mother of Fantassine? - Yes Maria De Ritis claims that a miracle happened and that Saint Antony gave her 5000 lire. Excuse me? Repeat that. Maria De Ritis says that in answer to her prayers, Saint Antony gave her 5000 lire. Exactly 5000? In bills of 1000? No, he made use of one big bill. Back to your posts, I'll take care of the miracle. Sampieri! My bicycle. (prayers) The marshal! Let me pass, please. Welcome, marshal. Our friendly fellow. Please. Marshal, you are the right hand of Saint Antony. - Me? - Yes you are. If you didn't stop my daughter, he would not have come to me. Kiss it and he will bless you too. Kiss it. Be wise. No horseplay please. Don't worry. We are praying for your soul too. Tell me, marshal. Who took care of the donkey last night? Someone who likes you. My respects, Don Emidio. I haven't discussed the merits of the miracle. It's your domain. Of course. You all! Listen, I don't want to hear about any miracle. Why? Because the church has to decide about these matters. All right, but Saint Antony gave me a blessing. A blessing is not a miracle. And we will research if this has been a rightful blessing. Maria, I'm coming to claim my money. - As you wish, sir. - Nice savings. Saint Antony did it. No matter Saint Antony, the total will be 6000 lire. Precisely. 1000 lire of capital and 5000 of interests. What do you say? I will send a bailiff. - You're the boss, sir. - Come and get it! Come here or I'll kill you. Come here. Catch her. Give me the money. The money! Peppi, I feel sick. It's nothing. Rest. Let him perish, let him perish. Let him perish, let him perish. - Fantassine! - What do you want? Come here. - Here it is. - What? The dress you wanted. I know everything. What do you know? Fantassine, you have a benefactor. Who then? No need to play comedy between us. Comedy, me? Beware about how you talk. Don't treat me this way, because If i may say so, I put you in a good word with the marshal. Who? Don't you understand it's me who told him to pay And he arranged for the miracle. Ah, it's like that! I will show him! Fantassine, what have you done? Nothing. - And the 5000 lire? - I tore it apart. Holy Virgin. But why? You know who brought me the 5000 lire? - Who? - The marshal. My God, I don't understand anything. First Saint Antony and now, the sergeant. Who told you? I know. Don't despair, but thank Saint Antony instead. - I need to be thankful? - Yes, listen to your mother! Shut up or I will blaspheme! Understand that the marshal has his intentions. Intentions worth 5000 lire. Good intentions. That pig! Speak polite. Even a pig can be a husband. Shut up or you'll see me again! I shut up, but come over here. Think about it. Stay with your Saint Antony! Saint Antony, so the miracle isn't it yours? It's the marshal? So help me getting my daughter married. Pasqualino, come here. Let's make a good joke to Fantassine but she shouldn't know anything. Are there any strawberries left? Yes. Enter. A present by Fantassine. - Where? - Outside. - Is she here? - No, it's her brother. - What's the matter, children? - Get up and say good morning. - Fantassine sent you this. - Some strawberries, thanks. She picked them for you as you're as good as Saint Antony. Saint Antony. - She went to the forest. - Oh yes? - To collect more. - It's all right. I'm fine. If you go there and want to help, you will make her very happy. If I go to the forest to help her? - Yes, sir. - Thanks. You may leave. - Say goodbye. - Goodbye. Marshal. What else? The Archpriest is asking if you could see him as soon as possible. - He said "as soon as possible"? - "As soon as possible". Impossible, hierarchy demands an urgent case in Calzolano. - Tell him I can't come see him. - You can't. - Tell him that I'll come immediately. - Immediately. - May I? - Enter. I'm sorry to bother you. I would have come myself, but our Saint Antony isn't ready yet for the great celebration of tomorrow. - For goodness sake. - What are you doing there? - Don't you see?. - Get out and close the door. - And Saint Antony? - I"ll take care of him. Why did I get the honor of your call? I will make no bones about it. Fantassine... whom you know well, is in the wrong of being the most beautiful and also the poorest of the village. Man follow her, but with what intentions? You understand. Everybody gossips about her, and is allowed to believe she is... - You understand. - The others, yes, but me... Last night also that gossiper niece of mine And you should have detained my niece. - What? - Yes, and not that poor girl. It was a pure preventive measure. Certainly, but this is not the only purpose of my call. - Is there something else? - Yes, and much worse. You know that sergeant Stelluti's mother is coming tomorrow. Yes, but I don't see the connection. - I will tell you. - Excuse me. Mrs Stelluti is not only coming to see her son, but also to meet Fantassine. She wants to take her as maid? Her son wants to marry her. I didn't know! Stelluti ought to... He is the best young man I know. Out of shyness somewhat, but also out of respect for the rules of the army, this scrupulous boy never dared to address a single word to Fantassine. - Just a few glances. - The rules don't prohibit glances. Especially if they concern honest feelings. Yes. All this is confidential, like a confession. I need your help to make these children happy. Can I count on you? - It's my duty. - Thank you so much. But I have to transfer Stelluti. Those are the rules. Please wait until after the ceremony. His mother arrives soon. - At your service, marshal. - Come on in. - Are you happy here? - Yes, sir. - How long have you been here? - 8 months. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I will send you on a special mission. - You will go alone. - Yes, sir. You know the forest of Forca d'acero? Yes sir, very well. You go there, casually... - And you patrol carefully. - Yes, sir. No need for your rifle. - Do as you're there for a stroll. - Yes, sir. - Take your time. - No, sir. If you encounter someone act like nothing goes on and have a chat. - Yes, sir. As much as you can. - Yes, sir. If it's a young girl, so much the better. It gives the impression that you're not on a mission. Is it really necessary? Not essential, but if you come across a beautiful girl, chat her up, stop her, it's better. Give her the impression that you are thinking to make love. - That's all. - And then, what do I do? How so? You stay as much as you can and you talk and talk. Look at the ones who pass by. - Yes sir. - You look out unnoticed. And keep on talking. Talk with the young lady. - What if she's not there? - Never mind. What if it's an old lady? What old? No. Don't stop them. Then you indicate that you're on duty. I understand. All right. You can go now. Quick! Yes, sir. I will report to you tonight. At your convenience. Good luck. Thank you, marshal. Go to make love, you too, go! Marshal, quick! My wife will give birth! - Call the midwife! - I need you. To assist the midwife? No, because the midwife has been kidnapped. Kidnapped? Yes sir, kidnapped. Good morning marshal. - Where is the midwife? - Inside. Call her immediately! Or I'll arrest you for kidnapping and for threatening at gun-point. Good morning marshal. What brings you here? Is it true that this man kidnapped you? - No, what happened? - The wife of Enrico Toppi. - She has contractions? - Yes, she will give birth. Enrico came to fetch you and he threatens with a gun. - Did you go crazy, Matteo? - My wife is very weak. She won't give birth for now. - But if she hastens... - Not before tonight! It takes one hour at least, going to Enrico by foot. If my wife gets into troubles I'm going commit murder. Calm down, we're trying our best. How is she doing, the poor lady, always up and down the village? If Annarella agrees, I can take her, but it will be uncomfortable. Perfect to me, but I don't want to disturb you. It's my pleasure. God bless you. You're a good man. Sit down, Donna Annarella. You push me! - Am I going too fast? - No, it's perfect. I'm very sorry for the bother. I never bothered with such pleasure. A beautiful day. Yes, a day in paradise. The marshal goes hard at her, full power. - What do they say? - Binoculars. Not telephone. She always sings, and keeps quiet just today. - It's the passion. - And when the marshal arrives? - He is cautious. - He is astute. How many appointments he must have had in the forest! If he doesn't marry my daughter, I will raise a scandal. Wait until he comes. Let him entertain. There she is with the marshal. Thanks. - I don't want to detain you. - I will stay, or it will be troubles... - May I? - Thanks. - How is Mariuccia? - The labour has begun. - Did you prepare warm water? - Since hours. Quick, Annarella. You first, marshal. Thanks. You are the grandma? - Yes. - Lucky woman. - Here it is. - No, why did you bother? A wine glass. At your health. To a boy! To a boy. To you and Annarella. You are her husband? She's a good girl. She has blessed hands. Why doesn't she give you a child? Your hair is grey already. Hurry up! Annarella, how is it going? It takes another two hours at least. Why did you make us rush? - Two more hours of this torture? - Is the linen clean at least? We are peasants, but our house has to be mentioned for cleanliness. Who is it? Get out of there, you don't scare me. Who is it? You? - It's me, miss. - I'm not misters' daughter. I have a letter for you. You became a postman? Don't talk like that. I wrote it for you. You don't have a mouth to speak with? It's better if you read it, so can know it all. "Dear Miss Maria De Ritis". - So, it's not true? - What? I will explain later. First, let me read. You have nice handwriting. I'll try my best. That is not the marshal! He would've sent a rifleman in his stead. Possible? Impossible. - Maybe he was passing by chance? - That's it. If he doesn't go, the marshal will stay away. You understand? Yes. I understand. Come and sit, keep me company. Do you have time? Yes, sir. I have all the time I want. Is it true that your mother is coming? It's true. I wrote her that she have to meet you. You wrote her that you love me? Yes, sir. Don't say "yes, sir". I'm not the marshal. I'm not used to talking to you. Take a strawberry. But they are in love! You dreamt that marshal of yours! I don't understand anything anymore. Should we hold the candle to them? Like the proverb "A bird in the hand..." You are right. One rifleman is better than nothing. So let's go. My mother wrote to the priest and he immediately answered, telling what a good girl you are. My daughter! My daughter with a rifleman! My daughter is dishonored! Go home. I'll see to this rifleman who dishonored my daughter! Don't listen to her. She is completely crazy! You really want to ruin me? Go away! Idiot! No dishonor no wedding. Go away! And you too! Leave me alone. What an embarrassment. What a misery. So she wasn't in agreement? That's true. Listen. My daughter didn't know anything. I swear to God. May I not see my children anymore. Let's go. You believe that? - You believe that? - Yes, I do. Don't cry. Tonight, I'll tell the marshal. But I'll have to go away. You'll forget about me? No, I love you very much. But you have to wait 20 months before we can marry. I would wait for you all my life. Annarella, quick! My wife gives birth. Are you crazy? You want to go to jail? - But I'm licensed. - I'll hit your head with the license. If my wife dies, I will kill you all. - I'm coming. - And my wife? She has time. Give me my bag. - Annarella, get on the horse. - You take care of your wife. Pray to God that I don't stop you for an armed threat. - Sorry. - Keep this until I'm back. Get seated, Annarella. Don't you understand that he is madly in love with her. What do I care. - It's better that I get off? - Why? - I am tiring you. - Me? I'm going to bike the heavens with you! Don't exaggerate. Exaggerate? If you could read my heart... I am illiterate. What a beautiful job you have! Where you are, there life blossoms. And a poet too. Near a lady like you, I become another human being. I become the one I always wanted to be. Like who? One day I will tell the story of my life. A novel. Which is filled with ladies. Yes, but no one like you. Because you're my fate. Watch out, marshal! Annarella. You know the motto of the riflemen? - No. - "Loyal through the ages." So I am, loyal. Loyal in love. I always sought true love and I never found it, until I came here... Providence. Excuse me. Annarella, hurry up, you will flirt later... I'll send you down. Excuse me. Sun of fire, sun of love Tell me who is the love of my heart Tell me where is the husband that I want Sun of fire, sun of love I want to talk italian like you do. And me as well as you do. It's time to go. Wait a minute. I'm on duty. - On duty? - Yes, sir. Stop with your "yes, sir"! Say "yes". - Yes. - Well done! Kiss me one more time. Yes, sir. - That's it! - Boy? No, girl. Next time a boy. - A drink? - No thanks. - You offend me. - Okay then. Quick, Annarella! She's giving birth. Hurry up! Calm down. Are you ready? The bag. You are experienced. A rifleman must be ready for anything. Now I am assistant-midwife. Push us. Get seated. Push! Concettina told me that you're not the midwife's husband. - No. - When is the wedding? Who knows? Old as you are, do you have this young lady wait? What old? Marshal! A boy! Why do you cry? It's happiness. Stay calm. You don't get started again! God gave me that fancy, and it's him who takes me. Why did you bother to wait so long? For Heaven's sake. Shall we leave? I'm back tomorrow morning. - Thank you, marshal. - No worries. I did what I can. Thanks. - Donna Annarella. - I can walk now. - Don't offend me. As people here say. - He has reason. - Goodbye. - See you tomorrow. Thanks again marshal. Goodbye. - Engine problems? - I turned it off, we're on a gentle slope. - What a beautiful sunset. - Very nice. "It's the hour in which desire touches the sailor's heart." - You know it all. - All what? Don't play with my heart. - I won't dare to. - Then? - Change the subject. - Excuse me. I should have know that your heart is already involved. You have lots of imagination. Isn't it true then? You could love me. Since the very first day, I... My God, help me, marshal! - Are you hurt? - No, and you? I am in paradise. Leave me, marshal. Leave me in peace. How could I see you again? I beg you. Leave me. Do we see again, Annarella? What a day, Caramella! What a day. What do you do here? Marshal, we have to talk reservedly. Do me a favor. Don't show up till monday. No, don't talk. I ignore. Understood? I ignore... - But marshal, it's duty. - I beg you. Please go. Annarella's maid brought it. For me? Go. "Dear marshal, your self-abnegation today, "and your charming words, made me lose my head. "But I recovered my sense now, and I urge you to forget it all. "Forget what happened, and forget about me. "I could never reciprocate your feelings neither now or ever. "I could never reciprocate your feelings neither now or ever. "Don't ask me why. My reasons are private. "I will respect you forever, Anna Mirtia." No, it's impossible. She can't make a fool of me. Are you talking to yourself? You know, today I've done a good deed. - Yes. - And how will destiny reward me? Scoffing at me. It is mocking me, Caramella. It is mocking me! - Marshal. - What? My mother would like to meet you. - I'm delighted. - God bless you. My son is delighted to be at your service. He will leave tomorrow. I know, anyhow, he will wait. I'm sorry, but that's in the rules. He is locked in my heart and can not run away. Do you hear? Lucky man. I wish you the same. Oh me, by now... - I feel very honored madame. - Take care. Caramella! What's new? Don't you know? She locked herself up since three days. She wants to see nobody, and doesn't attend the mass, and the balcony isn't decorated. I don't get it. Me neither. Look the procession. Maybe Saint Antony will be graceful. Look at Saint Antony, marshal. - You saw? - Pray for Saint Antony. This matter has to cease. Who is this? Friends. - Who? - Friends. You? And why? - May I? - Yes, but you don't have to. You forced me. I forced you to? Yes, because you can't play with my heart, dear miss. The other night I took a step no other woman lead me to, and after you gave me a sweet certainty, you said "nothing doing", point blank. But i won't give up. If I had written a similar letter to you, you'd have thought: "This marshal is a womanizer, a Don Juan, or worse..." You have no right to do that. It's different. I'm a lady. What lady? We are equals now. I vote, you vote. I am a marshal and you're a midwife. Certain female privileges are over. You roused a great passion in my heart. I offer you my life. I won't give up. I'll never give up. Unless you're playing two-timer. What do you mean? I mean if you have someone else in Rome... My son lives in Rome. You're a widow? No. Divorced? - Not at all. - Divorced from a foreigner? No, that's why I can't and won't marry you. You could understand or realize by the way I wrote, after all that happened, I had serious reasons. Now, you know everything. Is the same old story of the young girl seduced and abandoned. But I didn't make a fuss about it, I worked... and I still work, for my son. It makes you honorable. Thank you. Thanks for the respect. Now you understand why I couldn't... I was wrong in giving you hope. A moment of weakness. I'm sorry. I'm not a woman you could marry. I know, the army won't let me, but I will resign. - Oh my God, what's that? - Fireworks. It's true. How stupid. Come on. You don't like fireworks? - What will people say? - What they'll say? That the marshal is crazy about the midwife, and that's true. That's the holy truth. Come on Annarella, everybody must see that we're engaged. The marshal is crazy about the midwife. Greetings, marshal. Greetings, Fantassine. THE END
