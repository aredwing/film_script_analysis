Put your gun on the counter. - Clear left. - Clear right. Right. Call your boss. Sir! Watch your right! We got her! Hold, hold, hold, hold. Back off. Back off! No more throwing your magic wand, princess. I was just putting a spell on that house... for not having its lights on. Yes, while that might make purr-fect sense, Mommy just doesn't want to have to... climb through the bushes again But Daddy says cats love... climbing through bushes. I'll climb in the bushes. No, you won't, 'Mean' Joe Greene. Now, which one of you witches, goblins, midgets, and ghouls can tell me... why penguins waddle? Is that Nick? Yes, that would be my husband. Because their legs are set very far back on their body. That's not that interesting, though, huh? I guess you guys want some candy around now? Okay, hold on. Here we go, kids. Ready? Open your bags. Here we go. All right. You guys be good. And stay out of politics. All right, my little linebacker. Time for us to go home. We have a long walk all the way across the street. Good night, Char. See you tomorrow, Abby. Nice costume, Nick. What costume, Charlotte? Hi, Daddy. Hi, honey. Look at all my candy! Wow, you're gonna be up for, like, days, huh? Come on. Let's go inside, guys. So, then the princess turned into a dragon... that could breathe fire. A princess turned into a dragon? Yeah, that's my part of the story, Mommy. Tomorrow night, we can change it back. But tonight, the princess is a dragon. So, then you know what happened? The next thing that happened... Will you tell me a story? Yeah. There once was a handsome prince... I like it already. ...Who was madly in love... with a beautiful, dark-haired knight. Knight? You know, it was a very progressive realm. What? The knight was a woman. Come on, Turbo! Okay, Mommy, I'm ready! Okay, good! Come on. Okay. All right. Have a good day. Have fun. Haley, don't run. She's all right. Brian's out of town for three weeks. So you know what they say when the cat's away? The mouse misses him. Exactly. Why don't you come over this weekend? Board games, barbecue. I thought you'd never ask. - Hey, honey. - Help! Our computers are down, honey. We're dead in the water. Well, did you try to reboot? I won't even touch that thing. Okay. Do you want me to come by? Yeah. Would you, please? All right. I'll be right there. You see this? Now, this microchip goes under Gatsby's fur. So if he ever runs away again, we can find him right away. Now, the number on the side here is his tracking number. I'm gonna type this number into our computer... so we can see where Gatsby is at all times. And he'll never get lost again? Never again. Okay. Okay. It's a deal, then, right? So, I'll see you and Gatsby on Thursday. All right. All right, pal. Thank you. My savior. Hey, baby. Hi. Come on. So I got this blue screen, and then every computer in the place just froze up, honey. Oh, that's not good. Yeah. But my computer-genius wife can fix it, right? How did we ever function before computers? Remember the pencil? Suddenly, I feel so completely inept. You should never feel inept. You're the most 'ept' man I know. Is 'ept' a word? Are we gonna finish fixing my computer or what? I already fixed it. That fast, huh? Why the military ever let a tech whiz like you go, I'll never know. I love you. I love you, too, honey. What's it called again? A microchip. And it doesn't hurt when you put it in a cat? Not a bit. And we can find them if they get lost. Is that me or you, honey? That's me. Hello? Abby? It's Davis. Jeremy? Wow. It's been a long time. Look, Sam Pratt died. What? How? That's the rough part. Suicide. You there? Yeah. Yeah, I'm still here. Funeral's the day after tomorrow, Lakeside Cemetery. Thanks for letting me know. I'll see you if I see you. What is it? You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I guess I better eat my ice cream. Come on. And then the dragon turned back into a princess... and went back to the castle. Sweet dreams, angel. Hey, you want to see my son? Your son? But, Sam, I thought your wife wasn't due till April. That's my boy. I thought you were gonna wait to find out. No. I told Pauline I want to know, you know, just in case. Well, you know what? He looks like you. LM-13, LM-13. Mongoose is a go. I repeat, Mongoose is a go Mongoose is a go. Yo! We've got our orders, Jeremy. Follow us. Copy that. Go! Go! Go! Who called earlier, babe? His name is Jeremy Davis. He was one of the guys in my unit. He called to tell me someone died. Well, who was it? A member of our unit Samuel Pratt. I'm sorry, babe. There were only three of us in the unit, so we got close. He was killed in Afghanistan? No. He was home. He committed suicide. Why? Any idea why? No. Jeremy wants me to go to the funeral, day after tomorrow. You should go. You ever gonna tell me what happened back then, honey? It's nothing we need to talk about. Maybe it is. Good night, baby. We come here today to... honor the life of Samuel Pratt, soldier, husband, father, friend. Samuel was all these things and much more. The soldier Samuel served his country... with dignity, honor, and bravery. Twice decorated, he represented the best of the best. Samuel the husband was kind and thoughtful. His wife, Pauline, tells me he was a man of few words... who spoke volumes with his loving gestures. The father, never was a man so proud to be a father. Although their time together was cut short Jeremy. Abby. Nice to see you again. Man. You, too. ...like his father. You're Abby. I recognize you from your picture. He talked about you. I'm Pauline. Hey. You're handsome, just like your dad. I'm so sorry, Pauline. I understand you live in Alexandria. Yeah. I'm sorry we never had you over. Hey, if you need anything, anything at all, just call me, all right? Anytime. Thank you, Abby. Come on. Walk with me? Why would he kill himself eight years after the fact? Well, Pratt never got over... getting kicked out of the military. They didn't kick us out. All right, we were honorably discharged, but I don't care what they call it. The military was Pratt's life. He had a child. Man, I should have called him once or twice over the years. I should have done something. I see you're still blaming yourself for everything. Look, Abby, let it go, okay? Look at you now. You're a regular soccer mom. You got the hubby. You got the kid. You got it all. Are you happy? Yes. He must be one hell of a guy. He is. Yeah. You both are. God, every day I'm reminded of how lucky I am. I'm in the PTA. You're in the PTA? And I love it. All right, the girl's going rogue. Yeah. Well, speaking of family, I got to get going. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. Well, look, if you want to talk, I'll be in town until tomorrow night. I'm staying at the Alexandria Hotel. Let's not keep the wall up. Okay. It's good to see you. You, too. Okay. All right. Hi, you've reached my cell phone. Please leave a message. Hey, baby. I just wanted to tell you... that I love you and I'm sorry about last night. Let's talk tonight about everything. Hi, Heather. Is my husband there? I'm sorry, Mrs. Collins. He left early today. What time did he leave? I guess it was around noon. Noon? I was at lunch, so I'm not exactly sure. Okay. Thanks, Heather. Hi, you've reached my cell phone. Please leave a message. Nick, please call me when you get this. Daddy's gonna miss pancakes for dinner. We should wait for him. I'm sure he'll be home soon. Nick? Hey, Abby, what you doing? Charlotte. Is everything okay? You sound stressed. No, I'm fine. I just haven't heard from Nick in awhile, and I'm starting to get a little worried. That's probably him now. Okay, bye. If you want your husband to live, you'll do exactly what we tell you. You tell anyone, and he dies. We are watching your every move. Instructions will follow. When's Daddy gonna be home? He's working late tonight, honey. But what about our pancakes? Maybe we should bring them to his work. I don't think so. We should just save them till tomorrow night. You know what, honey? I think I better go down and help Daddy at work. How'd you like to go play with Haley... for a little while, huh? Maybe even spend the night? Can't I go with you? Mommy's got to do computer work. Besides, you're gonna have more fun with Haley. Come on. Abby. Hi. I need a big favor. Sure, honey. What is it? Can you watch Penny for the night? I know it's last minute, but... Yes, of course. It's no problem. I brought her pj's, and some of her things I'm not sure how late I'll be. Is everything all right? Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. Come on, we can play! Honey, why don't you take Penny to your room? I want to go with you. Sweetheart, I promise I'll be back soon, all right? Go with Haley, have some fun. Okay. All right. We were making pancakes, and something came up. So I brought this. I got pancake batter and syrup. If you wouldn't mind? I promised her pancakes. Abby, what's going on? Where's Nick? Can we talk later? Is there something I can do to help? You are. This is helping. I'm here if you feel like talking. Thank you, Charlotte. Think! Oh, God. What am I doing? They probably tapped the phones. You have reached a department... within the National Security Agency. Please enter your access code. Signals Analysis. Lincoln, it's Abby. Who? Lieutenant Spencer. First Lieutenant Spencer? Yeah. It's been a long time. Yeah, it has. Look, I need to trace a transmission. I have the IP address. Can you get me access to server records... ...so I can run a search? Sure. Give me three minutes. Abby? Sam was so distracted the last few weeks. He spent so much time downstairs... locked up in his office. Was he working on something down there? I don't know what he was doing. I mean, we talked about everything. Well, almost everything. He didn't talk about the past. What happened back there? People are starting to leave. Excuse me. All right, let's move out. Mr. Taraki's in U.S. custody now. Come on. Come on, let's go. Come on. You'll ride with us. You'll meet with your wife and daughter in Kabul later. Come on. Get in. What is it? I don't know. Something feels funky. He's just waiting for us to leave. Yeah, I don't like the way he's still standing there. You know what they say. 'Never trust the last man standing.' Come on. What are you doing in here? What's going on? I'm so sorry, Pauline. I can't explain everything right now. I want you to watch what happens... when you don't follow our instructions. The next time you disobey us, your husband will die. Now go to the Concord train station. Instructions are in locker 214. You have 10 minutes. Two minutes. Hey! How are you doing? That's sweet. Excuse me. I was wondering if you could tell me... where the security office is located? It'll be just right there, up the hallway. Thank you. You're welcome. It's okay. Officer Halverson. Sorry to interrupt your dinner. I need to review the security footage for the last 48 hours. I only need the footage from camera five, the locker area. Can you speed it up? What are you looking for? Just speed it up. Stop. Advance it frame by frame. Come on, come on. Turn around, so I can see your face. Thanks. What took you so long? There were a lot of people around. I thought it best to find a more discreet area. Don't let it happen again. We're under a very strict timeline. I'd like to talk to my husband. From now on, you'll use this phone only. There's one number programmed into the phone. Ours. Do you understand? Yes. I'd like to talk to... Do you understand? Yes. What do you want from me? The timer on your phone is counting down... from three-and-a-half hours. If you haven't completed the task we set out... by the time it reaches zero, your husband will die. Just tell me what you want from me. I want you to go to 401 Commerce Circle. Call when you arrive. Have you arrived at the location? What is this place? By 8:00 p.m., all personnel will... have left for the evening. That's when you go in. Go in? You then have 20 minutes to get into the main building. Get to the fourth floor and enter... the private office of the CEO. What are you sending me to get? There was a key card taped to the phone. Bring it. Hello? Jeremy, can we meet? I need your help. Nick's been kidnapped. When? They must have known his schedule... and taken him from work. Jeremy, I think Pratt is connected to this somehow. Why do you say that? It's the only clue I have. Well, that's not much to go on. I need to find out who took my husband... as much as I need to know why. Look, I have an important call. I'll see you in 10. Okay. Yeah. Hello? Charlotte, hi. Abby. I've been worried. No, no, I'm doing okay. Can you put Penny on the phone? I promised I'd call her before she went to sleep. Okay. Hang on. Hi, Mommy. Hey, snickerdoodle. See, I didn't forget. Are we going to finish Daddy's story? Right, where did we leave off? With the dragon and the princess. That's right. The dragon turned back into a princess. I hacked into the city-planning database... and downloaded the blueprints for the building. This building has two access points. Now, each entry has two guards. You got to secure the outside guards fast... in order to get inside and take out the floater. Less exposure on the outside, the better. You know you don't have to do this alone. Yes, I do. How long have you been married? Seven years. So you must have met him as soon as we got out. Yeah. I told him I was a technical analyst. Well, that's half true. Why not the whole truth? I guess I just wanted to start fresh. I shouldn't have lied to him. You were just trying to protect the one you love They will kill my family. Please, they just want me, okay? Let me go. I can't do that. You don't have a family yet, do you? Someday, you will understand that... there is nothing you would not do to keep them from harm. And at that moment, you'll regret this decision. Hey, Abby. Abby! Hey! What happened to Omar Taraki after we got out? Taraki? I don't know. He disappeared. Why are you asking me about Taraki? He told me I would regret my decision someday. What are you talking about, Abby? What time is it? I need the security protocol. Jeremy, this is Pratt's company. First his house, and now this? What if they went to him first? It's his company I'm breaking into. Obviously, what they want is in there. He refuses to play ball, they kill him and make it look like a suicide. Oh, come on, Abby. What? It's just all a coincidence? Look, they know how Pratt and I are connected, which means that they must know about you, too. All right, you need to watch your back. Yeah, well, if that were true, then I would be next, not you. You know, no offense to you, okay, but I was the one who knocked down doors, remember? Yeah, well, I have something that you don't have, family. All right, we're gonna have to call some friends. We need some help on this. No, there's no 'we.' It's me. It's all me. I did this. I made the decision. What decision? Abby, what decision? I have to go. I have two hours and 47 minutes to figure this out... before they kill my husband. I want you to watch something. What is this? I'm not gonna read anything. There's a file hidden on the company network. Locate it, then call. The file name is 'Mongoose.' Hurry up, Abby. Your husband doesn't have much time. Mongoose is a go. I repeat, Mongoose is go Mongoose is a go. LM-13, LM-13. LM-13, LM-13. What do you do... when you arrive at a locked door? You go through the window. Binary adapter. Deliminator. System input. Host. What's on the screen? 'Royal Bank of Antigua.' It's asking for a password. The password and everything you'll need... is in the Mongoose file that you just located. Need for what? You're going to access Samuel Pratt's bank account, then transfer the entire balance to another account. In 30 seconds, check your phone. You'll find the account and routing... number of the second bank. That's where you'll transfer the money. Do you understand your instructions? Yes. Operations. Get me Agent Tyler. Quantico. The Feds. I'm running the trace protocol now, sir. Yes, sir. I'm getting the location now. Wait. Somebody just shut us down. But I think I got their location. What's the delay? How do I know you won't kill my husband... the minute I transfer the money? You want a guarantee? If you don't transfer the money, Nick will be killed. That's a guarantee. I don't think you fully appreciate... the seriousness of the situation. It's time to make a decision. All right. All right. Look, I'm almost done. It's asking for the account... password to confirm the transfer. I already gave you the account numbers. No, I need the password. When the account was set up, you created a password. It's asking for that to complete the transaction If you're lying to me, your husband's going to pay the price. You can change it the second I'm done. Fine. I'll send you a text with the password. Come on. Come on. The building is surrounded. Exit slowly with your hands in the air. I repeat, exit slowly with your hands in the air. Keep your hands up. Drop the bag! Drop the bag! Come on! Let's go! Hello? Charlotte, is everything all right? Well, Penny's having trouble sleeping. Okay. Can you put her on the phone? Sure. Hold on. Mommy? Hi, honey. Charlotte said you couldn't sleep. Haley is using the whole bed. Well, just ask Haley to move... over a little and share the bed. Are you coming back soon? Yes, I'll be there soon. Pinkie promise. All right, just try to get some sleep, okay? Okay- I love you. I love you, too, Mommy. Hello? Jeremy. Are you all right? This whole thing is about money. They had me transfer $2 million... to an offshore account in Antigua, and then they set me up to be arrested. What do you mean, 'They set you up'? The FBI was watching the account. They had to know that. What the hell was Pratt into? I don't know. They have their money. Now what? They don't have their money yet. I changed the pass code on the account, and I put everything on a flash drive. I needed something to bargain with to keep Nick alive. They can't access the account without the flash drive. Look, Jeremy, I need a favor. Name it. I need a car. My plates are hot. All right, you can have my rental. Where are you? About a half-mile from your hotel. Meet me on level 2B of the parking structure. Space 128. Okay, great. All right, follow me. All you, sir. Do not touch anything! My name is Agent Tyler. I want everyone out of here except my tech agent. Come on. Time is our enemy. Lay it out for me, Kowalski. We can't access this system. It's defense-grade security. All we know is that the account... was accessed from this computer. It belongs to the recently deceased CEO, Samuel Pratt. Someone logged on to the company network, accessed this system, and then somehow got all the banking information... and executed a blind transfer... to an offshore bank account somewhere here. Really? That's all you got? With all the security we had in place, how was that possible? This guy shut down our trace. He knew our protocols. He's not your ordinary hacker. It's a woman. What's that? We just got done taking statements... from in-house security. The suspect is a woman. Where did your guy learn to fight? I guess you feel pretty... clever creating that flash drive. Not very clever getting your friend killed, though. What was his name? Jeremy Davis? You should have kept him out of this. I suggest we stop wasting time and get down to business. You're gonna bring me the flash drive. There's an overpass not far from your home. No, you're not getting the flash drive... until I see my husband alive. You're not in a position to make demands. Well, I am if you want your$2 million. Send me a video file of my husband showing he's alive. And I want a live feed, nothing recorded. You're playing with your husband's life, Abby. Have him tell me he's all right. You got 10 minutes, or I destroy the flash drive. No, they ambushed the caravan. We secured Taraki, but they got his wife and child. Please, turn me over to them. Look, we can't do that. They will kill my family. No, we won't let that happen. Please, they just want me, okay? Let me go. There's a door in the back. Just turn your head for a moment. I can't do that. It is my wife and child! If I let you go, there's a good chance... they will kill you and your family. Do you really want to take that risk? You don't have a family yet, do you? Someday, God willing, you will. Then you will understand that... there is nothing you would not... do to keep them from harm, okay? And at that moment, you'll regret this decision. You have reached a department... within the National Security Agency. Please enter your access code. Signals Analysis. Lincoln, it's Abby. I need your help with something else. Abby, I can't keep running these traces for you. They're gonna kill my husband. What are you talking about, someone's gonna kill your husband? He was taken this morning. You mean he's been kidnapped? Look, if I don't find him, they will kill him. Can you triangulate a cell phone for me? Of course, Abby. I can do that for you I need the location of a cell phone... that's about to send a live video file to mine. Okay, I'll run a trace signal through a local phone carrier. And I need it now, right now. All right, give me your cell phone number. I don't know it. Abby, you don't know your own cell phone number? I don't know the number. How did I not remember that? Abby, you know I can't triangulate... anything without that number. Wait. You can use the phone's serial number... and my location to triangulate it. That'll probably work. What's the serial number? Charlie-Delta-Foxtrot-1-7-1. Why not kill the guard? I want an identity on this woman within the hour. Yes, sir. I'm okay, Abby. I know I don't look so hot right... now, but I'm fine. Don't worry. Can you hear me? Abby? Abby? Honey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart. I'm so sorry, Nick. I'm so sorry. Baby, this isn't your fault. I love you. I love you, too, honey. Don't worry about me. All right, that's enough. Take him away. Wait! Abby! Don't forget to feed Gatsby! Don't forget to feed Gatsby, honey! We'll give you 10 minutes to make your decision. Please tell me you got something. The signal's coming from a cargo warehouse... about four miles from where you are right now. Be careful, Abby. Thank you, Lincoln. You're not taking this seriously, Abby. In fact, I hear trucks in the background. You're not out looking for Nick now, are you? Who are you? Just tell me who you are. It doesn't matter who I am. You've got your proof of life. That is the last concession you will get from me. Now, I want you to go to the 3rd Street overpass That's where you'll hand over the flash drive. I want an even trade. Nick for the flash drive at the same time. You already got your concession. No more. And I'm telling you, if Nick isn't there, you can kiss your money goodbye. Charlotte. What do you got? The car. Local PD found it abandoned. It's registered to Abby Collins, lives in Old Village. She's married to Nicholas Collins. They have a 5-year-old daughter. Nicholas Collins owns a... neighborhood veterinary clinic. Let's get cars to both locations. And Abby Collins has a military background, served in Afghanistan with a black ops outfit. Just like our departed CEO, Samuel Pratt. Penny! Where are the girls? Where are they? In my room. I told them they could sleep with me tonight. We got to get them out of here right now. Abby, what's going on? I know I owe you an explanation... for everything. I just can't right now. I am not yanking my child out of... bed in the middle of the night... unless you tell me why. Nick was kidnapped earlier today, and whoever took him has this address Oh, my God. I didn't think. I should have known... that they could find this address. I'm so sorry. I need to call Brian. You can call him from the motel room. Motel? Are we going home now, Mommy? Hi, honey. Wait. No, no, no. No lights. All right, we're going out the back. Just follow me. Mommy? Hey, sweetie, you want to play a little game? You and Haley? It's called 'hide from the dragon.' And the way we win is to stay real quiet... so that the dragon doesn't hear you. Does that sound like fun? Okay. I know you didn't learn that in Pilates. Hand them to me. All right. Let's go. Come with me. Okay, come on. Here. Go get it. All units, all units. Suspect is 42-year-old Caucasian... female Abigail Collins, wanted in connection with assault on... security personnel at Geographic Logistics. Suspect evaded and disabled local... law enforcement personnel... during a high-speed chase. Collins possesses military training... and should be considered armed and extremely dangerous. Use of preemptive deadly force is authorized. One night? Yes, only for one night. Here you go. Thanks. Come on, guys. Watch your step. Hold the railing. Can we have the TV on? Sure. Just for a little while. You two need some rest. Here. I'm going to go and get them some juice from the machine. Abby, why don't you come with me? Okay, be right back. Abby, why haven't you called the police about this? They'll kill him if I do. I don't mean to be callous, but what about our kids? They're threatening our children. We need to call the police. I want you to call them when I leave, but the kids are safe here for now. Leave? Where are you going? What do these people want from you? Is it money? Do you need money? Brian and I can help. Charlotte, I'll never be able to thank you... for what you've already done for me... and for us, and I'm so sorry I put you through this. Abby, what are you gonna do? I don't know yet. The lion cub has wandered away from its mother. You two having fun? They have our favorite movies on this TV, Mommy. I know. That's pretty neat. Just a little more TV, and then some sleep. Because, otherwise, the sandman is gonna get you. The female lion goes in search of her lost cub. If my daddy were here, he could find him. He puts a microchip in the cat, and then he knows where they are. Don't forget to feed Gatsby! This microchip goes under Gatsby's fur. And then we can see where Gatsby is at all times. Don't forget to feed Gatsby! He was telling me how to find him. Wait 45 minutes, and then call the police. That's definitely our girl. Nice. We found her. She's at the Owner's name. I need the owner's name. Gatsby. Owner's name, Harris. Where are you, Nick? You three, in the front. We're taking the rear. Stay low. Move quickly, gentlemen. Move, move, move. Go, go, go. Clear left. Clear right. - One up. - Two up. - Three clear. - Room clear. Clear! Go, go, go, go. Clear left. Clear right. Clear right. Room clear. Watch your left side. Watch your left side. Put your gun on the counter. Room clear! Right. Call your boss. Sir! Watch your right! We got her! Hold, hold, hold, hold. Back off. Back off! Give her some room. Are you in charge here? Yes, I am. My name is Agent Tyler. Everyone clear out but Agent Tyler. I think they're waiting to hear from you. Everyone out. Now! All right. Tyler, over here, nice and slow. Cuff Agent Tyler's hands behind his back. All right, out the back. Close the door behind you. Sit. What's your plan? You don't have one, do you? I can help you. We can help each other. Don't you want to see your husband and daughter again? Nick and Penny, right? Yes, I know all about you. Marine Corps, Special Forces, then there was that black ops assignment, Omar Taraki, the Afghan chemist who was going... to testify against al-Qaeda. You were supposed to be protecting him, right? Him and his family? Whose idea was it to sell him out? Yours or Samuel Pratt's? What are you talking about? We've been watching that bank account... for two years, waiting for someone to access it. I'm curious. Why now? Was it because Sam was out of the picture... and you wanted his share of the payoff? Or maybe he never cut you in. What payoff? What are you talking about? I'm talking about someone getting very rich... making sure Omar Taraki didn't testify. And you think Sam? No, no, no, no. I was with him. Sam... No. There's no way. All right. Let's pretend you weren't involved... and that Pratt was working alone. How did you know about the money, then? I didn't. You broke into his private office, accessed his bank account, and stole money you didn't know about. Would you buy that story? Everything you need to get the money... is on this flash drive. It's my husband. He was kidnapped this morning... by someone who wanted that money. And in 18 minutes, they're gonna kill him unless I can stop them. Why give that to me, then? We both know they'll kill him either way. Who is 'they'? Who knew about the money? This is ketamine. It won't hurt you, but it'll put you to sleep for about 20 minutes. All right, in two minutes, your... men will make a hard entry. They'll assume you're dead. They'll try to resuscitate you. When you wake up, go to 127 Junction Road. That's where you'll find me. One problem with your plan. We don't make hard entries when we've got a man inside. Except when shots are fired. You were supposed to... protect Taraki's family, right? Whose idea was it to sell him out? Yours or Samuel Pratt's? What's the situation on the ground, Captain Pratt? We tracked Taraki's wife and daughter... to a building about four clicks from town. Abby, you got eyes? Yeah, Sam. The mother and daughter are alive. I got three hostiles inside with them. Let's do this. We're clear. Abby, no! Don't go in there! Get back! You knew the wire was there. I'm at the drop site, but our lady hasn't shown up. She's got two minutes. Damn it! That's it. Kill him. Time's up. Wifey didn't show. Set down the weapon. Set down the weapon. That's the last time I'm gonna ask. Nick, I'm here. Are you all right? I'm fine. Did he hurt you? I'm fine. I'm all right, okay? Damn it. I got to find something to cut with. Abby, listen to me. Just leave. Call the police when you leave here. I'll be safe till then, honey. There's no way I'm gonna leave you, Nick. Hey, what's going on in there? Hey, where's your blindfold at? Abby! It's rubber buckshot. He'll be all right. You were shot? It's okay. I'm all right. I'm fine. I'm all right. Okay. I only remember one other op that I've been on... that's gone this pear-shaped. Don't move. Now, toss the knife. Toss the shotgun. Now turn around, slowly. What? 'Why?' That is what you want to ask, right? 'Why? Why? Why, Davis?' Well, it's real simple really. $10 million. That's why. You see, Pratt and I, we got an offer... that we just couldn't refuse. $5 million each if we stopped Taraki from testifying. But you'd be amazed at how fast $5 million can go. But, you see, Pratt, he still had half of his cut. But he wouldn't return my phone calls. You killed Pratt. Yeah, well, you know, if Pratt had just let you die... with Taraki's wife and daughter, it would have saved me a lot of trouble tonight. Never trust the last man standing. What was that? You're the last man standing. That's what Pratt was trying to tell me. That's true. So this last man's gonna make you a deal. You give me the flash drive, I'll walk out of here, leave you two lovebirds alone. You want the flash drive? Come and get it. Give him what he wants, and he'll leave. How about I just shoot you and take the flash drive? You know, you really disappoint me, Abby. There in the back! Go! Go! Go! - Freeze! - Don't move! I need paramedics to the northwest... quadrant of the warehouse. We need you to come in and help us sort all this out. How about tomorrow, sir? All right. Let's go home. Let's go home. Story time. Okay. You all right, honey? I wrote him a letter. Who? The Afghan guy? Yeah, Omar Taraki. I don't know if he'll ever get it, but... What did you say? Told him about us, our family, and how sorry I am... about what happened to his wife and child. Glad you did that. Yeah, me, too. Meet me in there? Yeah. Daddy, don't forget. Tonight, you have to tell me two parts of the story... since you missed last night. I didn't forget, honey. I actually have a surprise twist to that story. What is it? Well, it's about how the beautiful princess... had to rescue the handsome prince. That's a good twist. Yes, it is. And the best part of the story is... they lived happily ever after. But I'm getting ahead of myself. So, once upon a time, in a land far, far away, lived a fair-haired prince. So, one day, an evil dragon captured the prince... and took him deep inside a mountain. The beautiful dark-haired princess... searched high and low, and finally found the dragon's lair.
