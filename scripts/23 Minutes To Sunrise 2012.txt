Eddie. Two tours of duly in Iraq and Afghanistan. Honorably discharged, decorated for bravery, and ultimately discouraged by the things I saw there. I'm trying to finish my degree by taking online courses from the local community college. I guess I'm looking for something better. Knowing what that is and where to find it- that's the hard part. Guess I'll keep searching. But not right now, because I'm late for work. Hey. Hey, I'm fixing to leave to work. Eddie is picking me up. - Out of the way. Hey, don't smoke that in the house. - I'll smoke wherever I want. This is my house. Hey, leave me some money. I work the graveyard shift here, at the diner. Every night until the sun comes up. I don't mind it so much. Hell, most nights it's pretty quiet. Sure there are your losers and freaks that wander in here at this time of night. You know, I've seen some really strange stuff. And stuff you wouldn't believe. It makes flipping burgers a lot more interesting. Yeah, I like it. I just, I just don't feel like I'm alive anymore. I, I feel like I spent my whole life just watching. I've never been to China. I mean, does it exist? You've never been there, you've never seen it. That's silly, of course it exists. How do you know? You've never been there. I don't understand what you're trying to accomplish with all this. I don't feel alive. I mean, I don't Twitter, I don't Facebook. I don't care about some disaster in some godforsaken foreign country. I don't text, I don't lPhone, I don't even have a credit card. I don't have a mortgage. We don't own a home, we rent. And you don't even have a job right now. That's, that's not the point. What are you doing'! Well, looks like the lovers have worked it out Ain't love wonderful? They want whip cream with that? - No whip. Hi folks, just sit anywhere. Two at seven. Two at seven. How ya'll doing tonight? Good. I didn't say I wanted coffee. Just ignore him. We're on the late-night menu. So you can only order what's on the back, Honey. And if you're going to be trouble... you don't get to order anything. You look... different. Yeah? Well... gotta change with the times. That's funny. I'm just gonna go in and grab some beer baby. Be right back. Thank you. Have a good day. Will that be all for you? And I'll take a couple of those scratchers. You feeling lucky'? Who me'! Well, you're buying scratchers. You must be feeling lucky. Just keep it. Who knows man. Who knows. Well you don't look so lucky. Something happened in there. Fucking Pig- Don'! worry Shit. For the longest time, I struggled with believing in God. Than I realized that... I didn't even know what that meant. Believing in God. It's just... when you've seen all the suffering that goes on in this world. When you, when you see it up close... it's easy to think that it's all really just one big lottery. And when it's your time to die... you're just gone. - Gone'! Gone where? Nothing. No where. Here. Let me take those. # You should know better by now # Just coffee for now. Thanks. Do you have any real cream? Sure, I can get you some. Oh, sorry. No smoking Mister. But that's just for tourists. Ain't it? You haven'! changed a bit. No I haven't. No I haven't. Hey, Eddie. That guy at table seven is gonna be a problem. I don't like him. Steer clear of that guy. Alright? I know I'd seen him before. But you know how it is. You've been lots of places you've seen lots of people. And now there's some guy you know you've seen... and you can't remember where. And it's not the place it's supposed to be. But there they are. So I got plenty of time but, uh... What do ya wanna talk about'? You don't need me. Well, that's not really the point. I don't need anyone. That's right. You don't need anyone. So you certainly don't need me. I was only seventeen. Why are you being such a whiner? Got what you wanted. I didn't know any better. You begged me for it. You knew how it was going to tum out. Oh, baby. Come on. On, Christ. Check it out baby. Got our winning tickets right here. Come on. What'! Shit. It's alright. That's why I grabbed two. I talk too much. Hmm? I talk too much. I think you don't talk enough. Well that's my opinion. I can have an opinion. Yeah, but what if your opinion is wrong? And then you go and change your life based off a wrong opinion. And then you just make everything worse You know something? I think that's one of your biggest problems. You have bad opinions. You know I'm sorry I brought it up Proves my point. I talk too much. Shit! Shit! I'm not a loser. Baby, get back in the car. Come on. I'm not a loser. Baby get back in the car. Please. I'm not a loser. I'm not a loser. Look at me. It's ok. Baby I'm fine. I'm fine. Some people are afraid of death. Sometimes, I think waking up alive seems worse. Whatcha doin? Writing. 'Bout what? Writing something for my English class. Hmm. And you hope this will lead you to what kind of job? See, that's the thing. I'm not searching for a job. I already got one of those. ...searching for a life. Ok. What does that mean? What does that mean? - What's that mean? What does that mean... it means that if this is all I thought there was to life... think I'd rather just put a gun to my head right now. So... no life is better than this life. No. No, maybe not for everybody, but I can't speak for everybody. I can only speak for myself. That's kinda sad, Eddie. I never want to die. Ever. What I need you to do is tell me the marriage is over. What'! Honey, I can't say that. I don't know what's going to happen. Why don't you just be honest and say you don't love me anymore? I do love you! I still love you. You love me!? - Yes! You said you loved me like you loved the dog. Honey, I really loved that dog. You gave the dog away. Hey! Eddie! The usual. Yes Sir- The Usual for Superhero. So how's it gain', Man of Steel'! - Good. You know there's a lot of crime out there ...Sheila Can I get my coffee to go'? Also'! Sure. Large to go. I used to keep a journal. Wow. Really. Hmm. So what is this? Old German? Not at the time. "Not at the time..." Ah, I just got that. You know, I feel much safer with you here up at the counter. I'll be around. I hope so. Really. Do you wan't to know why I quit keeping it'? Because... it didn't matter any more. I had nothing new to say. Boy- you're gonna make me cry. You can't imagine what I've been through. And how is that my fault? It's just... I'm tired. I'm so tired. Hungry Baby'! I'll be right back. - Where you going? -Just wail here. Babe! - Just stay here, all right'? -Babe, What are you dong'! Babe! Why can'! is just be simple? I mean, why am I here? And she's here. But we're not together. Why are they together... and we're not'! Can we please go in now, I'm starving. Grab my sweatshirt. So what is it, exactly, that you want me to do? Just let it all end. Just like that. Badda-boom. It doesn't seem fair. What does it have to do with fair'? Without fairness, life is capricious. I just want to end this. You want out that bad, huh? I want to grow up. I want to be 18 and I want a boyfriend. A husband. I want a love. I want kids that won't be older than me by the time they're able to vote. Wow. That sounds really boring. Not to me. Hi, just sit anywhere. We're on the late night menu. It's on the back. Can I get some water also? Sure. How about you? No, I'm good. Where is everybody? Oh, it's about normal for Wednesday night. Let me get you some water. - Thank you. We're gonna eat first, right'! So like the two of them over there. Hmm? What possible reason could either of them find to get out of bed in the morning? That's what I want to know. I want a life. Donuts. Bet the only reason he gets up every day is donuts. Wow, that's fuckin' terrible. What kind of idiot do you have to be to fuck up a cup of coffee? Jesus. We didn't need his money. It wasn't about the money. He was fuckin' with me. He was waving to you. Shut up. Look at the menu, order when she gets back. Hand me my cards. Thank you. Look at the menu. You said you were hungry, right? You want to order when she gets back. Look at the menu. Stop it. What do you want'? Not everything in life is easy. Don't be such a dick. Whatever. You love it. OK. OK. Do you see that clock on the wall? Which one'! That's a good point. That one. Right there. It's 23 minutes to the hour. - OK If you can find someone in this room to take your place in the next 23 minutes, I will give you what you want. Tick- tick- tick- tick- tick- tick... Tick... Tick... You all right honey? Can I get you anything? She's all right. I wasn't talking to you. Let me show you where the restroom is. Tick tick tick tick... Go to hell. Now that's funny. That's funny. I know it's none of my business, but what are you doing with that guy'? A pretty girl like you... It's not what you think... I'm only thinking you can do a lot better. I made a mistake. Hey- We've all made mistakes. You can fix it. I don't think I can. I should've just died. What is with everyone tonight? Thinkin' that they'd rather die. Why's everyone in such a hurry to die'! I never want to die. Don't say that. It's true. No it ism Think about it, being what... I'd like to try that. Who wouldn't'! I better get back out there. Don'! let that guy push you around. He doesn't control you. You've got to live your life the way you want to live it. You got anybody to help you out'? You've never met someone so alone. Mom'! Dad? Dead. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I'll help you. You don't even know me. Maybe not. But I can't stand to see a young girl like you taken advantage of. It's just not right. What if I take advantage of you? Then Super Hero out there will protect me. What about Eddie? How do you know Eddie? I don't. I've just been watching the two of you. Yeah, Eddie'd protect me. That's nice to have. I've gotta go. #...peaches come from a can # # they were put there by a man...# # in a factory down -uh...# What the fuck? Are you fucking kidding me'? I guess they're out of paper towels. Read something to me from your notebook. Nah- you'd... it's boring. You really wouldn't like it. Oh, I see. So you think a simple waitress is too stupid to understand your deep thoughts? No, No, come on. Come on. You know it's not like that. Well then then read me something. Anything. I just want to hear you read something. For me. I feel weird about it. Let me read it then. The first person I killed. As I went up to his still form, I could see the holes that had accomplished my purpose. He wasn't much more than a teenager, with that wispy beard you try to grow to prove you're old enough. He still had his weapon in his hand. Has he met God, Allah, Jesus'! Did he die for a good cause, a just cause? Does it matter to him now? Maybe he is in paradise and all the terrible rotten things that happen in life are forgotten. Or maybe he's just dead and that's all.. Just dead and gone. I saw death, face to face, in the first person I killed. I've never read anything like that before. This is your basic blackjack. You've got 3 hands here, ok? Dealer's showin' a cowboy. So you gonna hit- ...not good. Too many. Too many. Well, that's an excellent poker hand but, too many. And dealer ...20. You know, in Vegas, they, they deal from a 4 deck shoe. It's... well, it's just like this, only different. But- um... Anyways, uh, as soon as we get settled in, Bobby said, he can get us a job at the Frontier. I'll deal therefor, I don't know, six months, and then move to the Luxor, the MGM or some other place on the Strip. Can we finally get married? Yeah. Sure thing. Soon as we get a little bit of money, we'll get married. It'll be just like that movie... what's that movie I like... that one about Vegas? It's got like, the flying Elvises? Jumpin' out of the airplane, the guy's like yellin' "The Flying Elvises!" That one. You like cards? Yeah. I'm going to be a dealer. You? Really? Yeah, me. What, does that fucking surprise you or something? NO. Uh... You just... you look young. Relax- ok? She didn't mean that... You know what? Fuck that. I don't have to put up with this shit. I've had to put up with shit my whole life- from my old man, my boss, every other asshole who thinks they can just walk all over me. I'm not puttin' up with any shit anymore. Look- look at me. She didn't mean it like that. Relax- hey... She's not like that. She just thought you looked too young. - Yeah, well, I'm old enough... I promise you that. I'm old enough. Look at me... You OK? Yeah. I'm old enough. Eddie... I know you. Don't I. Of course you do, Eddie. Why are you here? I don't think you realize how lucky you am. So few people actually meet me more than once And look- You're here. I'm here. Together again. Sunrise. She's busy. Not your personal secretary, bro. Yeah. Yeah, I'll give her the message. I said I'd give it to her. Who was that? Prince charming. What'd he want? He's comin' by. Said he wants you to meet him outside. Why'? Didn't say. When? Couple of minutes. Why can'! he just leave me alone at work'? Why don't you just tell him to stay away'? Hell, blame it on me. Yeah. He already thinks we got something gain' on. Then I'll tell him then. No. That'll just make it worse. What are you doing here, Ken? Gimmie my money. I gave you money this morning. Gimmie my money! This? You think this is your money'! Give me my fucking money!! This is not your... Gel off of me! Stop it! Take it! - Get out of my fuckin' car! You know, you're not worth it. Hey! Take it easy on the door. FUCK YOU! You OK? I'm fine. Did he hurt you'! I just need to use the little girls' room. Hey... hey. Do you want me to give you a ride home tonight? I said I'd be fine. Hey listen you piece of shit. You ever touch Sheila again and I will personally rip off your balls and shove 'em up your ass. You hear me? Never touch Sheila again. This is Eddie. Oh yeah... Fuck you. Would you mind putting that out? Did your wife send you over here to tell me that? Does it bother you? Me? No. Men are such chumps. Well'! Is he going to stop'! Well, he said he'd quit if you got your boyfriend to go over there to ask him. Now, I don't believe him, why don't you find out'? Well, I can see that this conversation isn't going much further. I need more time. I've given you 250 years. Not that much time. One day. Tomorrow. No. I have no friends. I have no family. I can't ever let someone know who I really am. This isn't life. Who am I going to convince in 17 minutes'! That's your problem. Maybe Eddie? I don't think so. He's already checked out. How do you know that? How do I know anything? Does he know who you are? He knows. He doesn't seem to remember but ...he knows. You OK? No. There's not a lot I can do about that right now. You know, there is something really wrong with that guy. The one with the little girl. She is in some sort of big trouble. And he is it. If she's with him, then she's bad news too. Trust me. Do you know them'! I've met him before, but that's not even the point. The point is I need you to trust me. Stay away from them. OK? Wait a minute- What do you mean? Listen... I just need you to trust me. Just stay away from them. I can't explain right now, but just trust me. OK. Does this change things? More than you'll ever know. I hope so. Look- it's not gonna happen, ck'! We're not going back there. What am I supposed to do'! Walk around naked all the time? Look, come on. You don't have to come in. I'll run up to my room really quick throw the stuff I need into a bag. And be back down in 5 minutes. Please? Yeah, well, what if he's there'? What then'! Well, if he is, I'll skip it, ck'? I told you if I see that bastard again I'm gonna fuckin' kill him. He would never be awake this time of night. Listen. - Please try'! Baby, baby, listen. We're not gain' back there. Not for anything, and not for anybody. This is it for us. Don't you understand? Hey. It's me and you. Ok? Look. We'll stop somewhere tomorrow and we'll get you a new outfit, allright? And anyways, when you get to Vegas, you're going to want a new look, right'! OK. It's going to be fine, babe. Got you. Hey Eddie. You need something. I'll get the waitress for you. No, Eddie, I don't need the waitress. Let's talk. About what'? I'm kind of busy over here. Do you know my friend out there? He says you know him. Yeah. I think so. Why'? So you know who he is'! Maybe. Look, I have a lot of work I need to finish here, ck'? So whatever the two of you have planned, please just leave me out of it. I have a proposition for you. I really can't afford a piece of ass right now. You don't look like the kind of guy who needs to pay. What do you want from me'? I have a special gift. You're lucky enough to survive a plane crash. Sort of. Good for you. Look at them Eddie. All of them. "Body never found." "Police failed to locate the body." "No body. No body... No body." It's more than luck. I don't die. I'm happy for you Look at the date. 1956. Look at me Eddie. How old do I look to you? - What is it that you want from me? Do you want to live forever Eddie'! Gel out of my kitchen. Go. Now. Gel out of my kitchen. Eddie, I can give you this gift. Would you and your friend go find someone else to mess with. It's true, Eddie. It's true. No, it's not. Would you please leave my kitchen now! Now. What are you doing with that knife? Put the knife down. What the fuck! All you have to do is say yes. Gel out. Just think about it Eddie. You can have it all. Mind your own business. Who would do that'! Perfect. hot sauce... Oh my god Eddie, what happened! Are you hurt'? I'm fine. It's not my blood. What! I don't wanna do this. Hey, come on. You're fine. You're ready. I promise. Look- Can't I just wait in the car? No. - Please? You're not waiting in the car. Look- You're just going to follow me, you can have the bag, Nobody is gonna come near you because if they do, I got this. This isn't my first rodeo. Ok? I love you. Me too. We're closing early. You and me, we're leaving. Ok, Let's go get a cup of coffee breakfast. Something. Eddie, what about those folks out there'! Give 'em their checks. Better yet, tell 'em it's on the house. I don't care, just... just get 'em outta here. What the heck, Eddie'! Now you're scaring me. When I was in the Army - over in the Middle East- my buddy and me were on patrol. As we were walking along a road, I saw someone run behind a building. I left my buddy to go check it out. As I was walking around the corner of the building, somebody started shooting at me. I dove in behind the building, and my buddy Billy took off to go find cover. He jumped behind a car and started to return fire. When the enemy fire stopped I started to run where Billy was. I got about 30 feet from the car when the whole thing just... just went up. An IED. The explosion was so big, it blew me back on my ass, but I really wasn't hurt. But I knew Billy was. I scrambled over to where he had been. And I saw. Dead. The IED had just ripped him apart. And then I saw something else. I saw a man. He was dressed in fatigues, but no stripes, no insignias. Nothin. He was just standing there, staring at Billy. And then he looked at me. He looked right through me. Then he just turned and walked away. And it was like he just faded into the smoke. That's the same guy out there. That's crazy, Eddie. I knew you would say that. But it's true. You even said it. There's something about that guy, right? You're serious aren't you'? I'll do whatever you say, Eddie. Whatever you say. You care more about your hair twining than you care about me. Whatever. Can I sit down? Would you like to live forever'? Hell no. Wait- wail. Does she have to live forever with me? What do you mean? Would you like to live forever'? What am I going to look like when I'm 500 years old? Just like you do today. So I never age. No. Can I be 21 again, forever'? No. You'll look just as you do today. I don't think so then. That was the worst display of vanity I've ever witnessed. Surprise, surprise. Another stupid opinion. How's that for a stupid opinion!? Allright everyone shut the fuck up! Allright everyone shut the fuck up! You, get out here! Empty the cash into a bag. You- get over there, now! Move! Hey! Didn't you hear me? I said get over there. Now!

Semi-automatic hand gun, Weighting in at 30 ounces when fully loaded, a favorite with military, law enforcement and Holl-lee-wood.
