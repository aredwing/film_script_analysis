West is getting improved in science, we are wasting time for superstition. West is running from technics to technics, we are running behind of superstitious people. West is respecting the wishes of human. We are restricting everything, one by one. We are poisoning the life. But, it will be the end of the medieval darkness anymore. - What an abstraction it is? - Don't ask, the math exam passed bad again. Hey man, she has smiled at me as I told you. Really? Don't deceive me. She smiled at me first time, stupid. Come on, walk, we are getting late. - I'm going to tell you on the way. - I can't come. My father is getting angry.

Something which makes me more and more crazy when I love. This emotion gives me gratification. I feel that I'm living. Take, this is yours. You will give after writing your name. - Well... You? - Don't mind me. No, this is injustice. But, I'm giving willingly. - Let it be whatever, this is not correct. - Please. No, Selman. - Madam. - Yes Merve? I didn't do my homework.

Is my mother inside, Hasan? No, she has gone. Answer that telephone, answer... Hello. Yes Ayhan? Hey girl, where is your director who is the air of a director? I really don't know. I have been calling him since morning. But, not answering. There will come new candidates but, he isn't in vision. He isn't answering my calling either. Look. I wonder, if something happened to that man? Oh, Heaven forbid. Come on, go to his room once. I have jobs to do. I'm not be able to go. All right. What's your problem, guy? Once, you are out of site... ...then, you got asleep on the streets. I don't know, how you are getting drunk. No drug, no alcohol, no woman. I'm taking a very nice girl to you. You are not so kind as to open the door either. Ayhan. I told you many times. Not to get interested in my world. Shut up. My God. You are sick. You are insisting on the world "loyalty". Hey, look...

Hmm? Yes? All right. Take him in. Welcome doctor Suat. We made you tired to come here. But, you know, it was a very important event for me. Thank you, Ayhan. What's the matter? - Hey, stop. Where? - I'm going. Let's see later. Hey stop, let me meet you. He is Suat. Sir, this is Selman. He is a director. Don't suppose that he looks intelligent... ...he is a bit ingenuous. You know, I have mentioned him to you before. I understand. Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm following you on press media. Suat is a psychologist. Nice... Good-bye. Hey, where are you going? Suat has come for you. You did it worst. Hey, Selman. Listen to me just a minute. Selman. Pardon me sir. Sory, we made you come here. But, he is very important for me... ...and he has some problems... He has problems. But, he is not aware of that. He doesn't think himself as a patient. You are right sir. There are a lot of such types generally among the intellectuals. Bravo sir. - Come here please. - OK. Pardon me. Have you ever seen the galaxies which are on the top of your fingers? Oh. This is insane. I have always thought the two answers of things while reading. Why have the people of my homeland been suffering for years? And, who I were? Contains each mote of the universe in it... ...audio and visuality. It means, an eye that looks carefully... ...can see the galaxies on the top ofthe fingers. The thing which is called as substance is composed of magnetic waves. Our brain converts these waves into vision and audio sound. We suppose, as if they are exist. Such as a television receiver. There is nothing called substance. lf so, what's there? It's an endless infinity. A philosopher says, we are at the center of this infinity. Exactly, at the center. And, he continues... ...human can do everything... ...when the discovers that he is endless. Well, how is it? He can be a bird and fly. If he holds a piece of stone tightly, he can crumble it. He can go to the time... ...and place he wishes. He can find his lost father... ...and darling... He can arrest the killers who covered everyehere with human blood. He can defy againist to people like oppressive Bolu Beyi. Who are the people like oppressive Bolu Beyi? If you look some more carefully, you'll see. Did the people like oppressive Bolu Beyi kidnap your father? I do hope you want to revenge on your father? You think, you are very intelligent. Aren't you? Where as I'm mentioning about suffering... ...many homicides without knowing who the murderers are. Families, who lost their members. Look to see them. What if Cemal Bey who takes place in your scenario? Very beautiful. It is said english style to these. In other words, very chic. Their prices are also suitable. If you want, you can think this. You can also take it as a gift. - May I look at it? - Sure, you may. Selman? Welcome to this dirty city. Cemal looks after you. You will work together with him too. I'm working together with a projectionist. - At least, is he a dependable person? - He is a very kind person. He likes me as much as his son. He also has a son, we are getting along very well. He said that "mum". He was laughing... Give up your rights on me. I asked, where he is going... Then a bullet... one more bullet... once more... and once more... His phone was on. They were attacking to the police station. There were attacking to a part of mine. My son... there... He was about to die. But, me... I wasn't able to do anything. - Your scarf maam... You can't enter. - But, I'm the mother of someone who died for this government. I'm sorry... Regulations. Your scarf maam... You can't teach in this attire. But, I've been teaching for 17 years, Cemal. Your scarf maam... You can't enter to school in this attire. 1997, 28th ofFebruary It is banditry, anarchy to try to convince someone by using force. My aim is to give social paranoia... ...with this family. Title of the film comes from here. The god would have created everybody merciful and philantropic, if god had wanted. But, god created human being. Created love... Created earth... To examine the human who loves really... ...to disappear who real lover, who the mock lover is. To know, who is running towards the light of love... ...who is running towards the darkness of denial. How would it be known, what luminous is if there hadn't been darkness? Does it be life, if fire doesn't burn and knife doesn't cut? Isn't there a place where the fire doesn't burn... ...and the knife doesn't cut? There is... Take me there. The fire didn't burn brahim. And the knife didn't cut smail. Go to elderly haji to ask him all these. He said that, he was going to come here for a lecture. There is full of idols inside you. Don't you see? My honey. Don't afraid. Take the ax... ...and break all the idols you faced. The idols which prevent you reach your darling. Which one is your idol? Beverage? Gamble? Fame? Rank? Money? Or woman? I can't know this. Only you know that. Don't afraid. Take the ax... ...and break all of the idols surrounding you. If it becomes idols inside you, it also becomes idols around you. You'll oppress and you'll eceive oppress. If you don't destroy the idols inside you... ...you can't destroy outside idols. Know that, the idols can be demolished... ...by the ax of sacred love. Emin efendi... Emin efendi... As if you are regarding him as divine. Never. He is a human being. So, he is as if a mediator between you and god... Never. Nobody can be a mediator between lover and darling. - If so... What? - He is only a guide. He is someone who knows where the darling is. What place? Does god have a spesific place? Never. God is everywhere. But, it's important to be able to see everywhere... ...but, not on the things you see. The things you see are stones, mountains, meat and bones. All these are imagination of them. Only god is seen. Who is going to show you? The people who have broken the devotions that were ordered to kepp by god... ...that who are wasted. How do you deny god who created you when you weren't exist? You are going to die, then you are going to be revived. At the end... you are going to be turned to god. God, who is the creator of everything on earth for you... Turned towards the sky to organize it in seven layers. God knows everything absolutely well. Recover me from this fortune. I beg for mercy. God had told angels: "I'm going to create a caliph on the earth." Open your secrets to me. My key? My key? My key? My key? Hello. Hello. Here you are... Hello. Here you are... I'm Osman... Hello.

She had got married. She had been together with someone else. She had embreced another guy's body. She had said... ...my love... ...my darling to someone else. Do you hear me? A poor excuse for a bird. Why don't you appear any more? He is a very interesting man. I said, I divorced. But, he didn't feel happy eighter. Don't ask, he established such a seperate world himself. That's nice. He will participate in your anguish. No, Belma... I don't intend him to participate. Don't talk nonsense. Why don't you that you have found someone who loves you as a crazy. Stop, stop... Or else... Haven't you take your tablet? Yes. OK. Take that. Hey, I don't understand you... It had been happened a miracle. The woman whom you waited for years had been come one day. I don't understand what disturbs you such... If she had married and divorced? I don't know, Ayhan. See here, what do you know anyway? As if she is not Merve... As...

I can't sell myself for the benefits of the world. I'm honored faculty member. - Oh. What an honor. - Darling... Please don't do that. Your work is wasting time. You only think afterdeath and... ...poisoning our lively world. - What? - Stop, stop stop. How is it? Entering boom. Be careful. Why is it here for? Who put this here? But, sir...

I'm not be able to believe that I'm together with you. You were such an unreachable person. There were times in which I was about to lose my mind to find a small trace of you. I was ready to give all of my fortune to reach even for one of your shadows. Why are you such a faraway of me? What a strange man you are? Take a rest, if you want... You look very tired. Your bed is ready. I have to work some more. Did you left the woman alone and slept in living room? Why are you getting such a surprise? You woke up seperately in the morning. You had breakfast together and... ...you took the woman to her house? What would happen? Well, what did woman say? What can she say, Ayhan? Yield to this amount. Your problem is really serious. Don't talk nonsence. Do I have to be together with someone to prove that? I don't believe. Your problem is not to believe already. Not to believe? You are mentioning not to believe. If there is someone who does not believe is you. There was a woman, who had conversation with you. Hmm... What was her name? OK. Aylin, Aylin. - Yes? - She took you into her head. She left her job after they interfere her program... ...and started in a newspaper. - What is there in it? She called me. She asked me how much I know Merve. She is researching something. Don't speak nonsense. Never mind. Why do you tell me not to speak nonsense? I don't know Merve either. The woman whom you say my darling seems me in auspicious. She benefits from your ingenuous. Don't you see? Ayhan, look. You are oversteping the limit. You are oversteping the limit? What oversteping the limit? Hey man, open your eyes and listen to me only once. Merve, Merve don't do that. - Let me, leave alone. - No Merve. No. You'll hold out. Don't be stupid, make up your mind. Come to your senses. How shall I come to my senses? Belma? Look, journalists have asked about me. They are wandering around us like hungry wolves. They can't do anything. Be calm. Everybody can make a mistake. Don't exaggerate these events. There is someone who loves you very much. Fill happy. My key... My key... Zeynep, are we ready? Sir. We are ready. You, go inside. Yes friends, we are about to start. - Thank you. - Certainly. - How are you? - Fine... - There is not any problem, is it? - No no, don't worry. - I hope it's going smoothly. - Thanks. Sir.

I'm going to drive crazy. You had better be crazy, if you have not been able to pay rent for three months. Do whatever everybody does instead of talking bombastically. What are you doing there? We are taking movie. Zeynep, go there immediately. Warn them as soon as possible. If there is a problem, go out and solve outside. You are behaving shamefully. Excuse me company. They makes human a crazy. They have dispersed all my atmosphere. Come on company, we are going on. Scene five, plan two, shooting four. Action. My wife. I can't sell myself for the benefit of the temporary world for a couple of days. So, let's stay feeling hungrily. We'll eat and drink honor. You don't intend to get full, your intention is show. Is it showing off, I want to the rent to be paid? I don't know, why you misunderstand everything. All you do is to philosophize. Turn the reality. What's happening here? What's happening? - Zeynep, didn't I send you here to stop talking? - Yes sir, but... - Zeynep, don't speak. We are taking movie here. - You're right sir. What are you concealing from me? What's that? - Zeynep? - Oh sir, it's not an important thing. - What are you concealing? - Sir, we are not concealing anything. - Zeynep, give it, give me that... - Really, it's not anything... Zeynep... Give that... - What's happening? What's this tension? - Why don't you look at the newspaper? - What's there in the newspaper? - It has been seized pornographic film. - Is it porn? - Furthermore, she had been a tele-girl. - Really? - I say tele-girl. - No, You are saying bunk. - It is not believable. Get off here. Father. Selman Bey. I can explain. Father. I wouldn't want it to be like this. All of them happened because of my husband. He deceived me by saying to make famous. That's enough... Push off... Selman Bey. Father. Father. Father. Father. - Please, Selman Bey... - Push off, come on... Father. Where are you going without finding treasure? Stand tight now. Father, father... You... You're... You are living here. Where did you get out? Suddenly like this? - Oh, my son. My son. - Dad... I have always waited for you, father. Come on, be calm anymore. Look, we have together. But... I got exhausted. Father, I got exhausted. I became exhausted. Contrary, you are borning again. Angel whom I devoted my life became devil. Your life hasn't been finished yet. I don't want to see you like this. Don't let you be exhausted. There isn't anything called myself to leave. Father. Are you real? Nothing you see is real. But... I see you. I'm able to touch you. I'm holding your hands, I'm able to... The things you suppose real are such... It is demonstrated as if they are real. That's... If I won't believe the things I see... Which one am I going to believe? It is important the yonder of what you see. Secret is there. There isn't impossible there. - Can I be a superman and fly? - You fly. I use to fly in my dream when I was a child. My body was in bed but, I was flying. Well... But. Who has flying when I was in bed? Who was sleeping... ...when I was flying? You fly again. It's enough to know its secret. Is there a secret in flying too? Of course. There is... There is a secret in everything. Father. Do you remember the box you gave me? This one? Do you know? I've never left this from my side. I kept my word. I've never opened. You had said that if you had looked at carefully, you would have seen. I've looked at. I've always looked at but, I couldn't see. I couldn't see anything. One day... I've waited for it to sing one day for a long time. But, it was not. It wasn't, was it father? There wasn't phoenix in reality. You had also known that. If you have known how to look, you would have been seen. Why don't you remember what the books were telling you read... You are able to see the galaxies on the top of your finger, if you look carefully. Father? How do you know those? Think what I mentioned. Leave me. You... You are not my father... You aren't Selman either What does it mean? The other person isn't Ahmet either. Another one isn't Mehmet... All of them are made-up. Exactly as the types as you made-up in your scenarios... Your problem it is. You forget yourself in a film and... ...suppose yourself as Selman. You are not Selman. Selman is the name of a role you are playing. Who am I? If you are looking for a face, know that... ...nobody has a face in reality. Pass Ahmet, Mehmet... Get out of that heap of meat and bone. Raise your head and look around yourself. Look and see yourself. Shot a bullet into your head or struck a sledgehammer, if you want... But, make up your mind. You are not Selman. Father. Who am I? Are you? You wanted to live an adventure. You have lived. It's time to return home. It's time to for swear. Father... Father... My key, my key... - Father, my key, my key... - Selman Bey, Selman Bey... Break that door. Selman Bey? Sir? Oh. Sir... - Come on, call an ambulance, quick. - OK. OK. - They say that, she has a very short time. - Oh... What a short time it. I threw up. Be a little bit respectful. Woman is dying. If I get respectful, what's going to happen? Is she going to get well? Stupid man, stupid... Idiot. What do you suppose to do? Hmm? He passed away without being a good man in particular. Open your eyes my one and only. Open your eyes honey. Patient looks fine generally, I say let's make him rest if you want... OK. Thank you very much. Well done thanks. Merve? - Where is Merve? - Well. She is very well, take care of yourself. Hasn't she ever dropped in on? Please, don't think all these anymore. Zeynep Hanm, we wonder a lot. A taking picture please. He couldn't regain consciousness, friends. - Taking only one photo, that's all. - Silent please. When his condition gets better, I will call you, especially you... OK? Only one photo, please. I promise that I will call you for first. OK? Come on, it's time to be nourished. I saw my father, Zeynep. I embaced him repletionaly. He was real, Zeynep. He was real. Maybe, in another dimension... But. I saw him. Whatever you say either god-given power... ...or miracle. - But, I saw. - OK. We'll speak later. Take that. Shawl. Shawl. Sory? A white shawl. The shawl my father used to wrap on his waist. - I don't understand. - Don't make me crazy. Me... - You were the first came to help me. - Yes. There was a bloody shawl wrapped on my waist. You were in trauma at that moment. That's normal. Don't let you leave health. Elderly haji. Yes, Elderly haji. The key is together with him. The treasure is together with him. What treasure? Zeynep. All of the answers are together with him. - What treasure? - At elderly haji. Get well soon. Musa. Come on. He is waiting for you. Oh. God... God... God... You have been changed alone. But even so I knew you. Everything will be changed. It's the most important to find unchanged. It's created universe first... ...then world... ...then human... We saw that is blooming leafby leaf itself. This universe itself and some one who makes it is? God. God. God. What is impossibility, according to you? Impossibility is for the people who live in borders. What about behind of borders? Behind the borders is infinity. It's possible everything in infinity. You live whereever you focus your conscious. Human heard, touched... ...and saw... Human saw that... only an imagination in mirror. He saw that there are neither mirror nor imagination. Someone, who made human see is God. God. God. How can I pass over the impossibility? What for like? Forexample, like to be a bird and fly. For example... Like to crush the stone and make into pieces. In my opinion, formula is hidden in a word which is known by everybody. What is that? Love. Well... But. But, I have been suffered that anguish fora period of life. It is correct you have suffered. But, it is uncorrect for you... ...to suppose that you have fallen in love with Merve. I don't understand. You can't understand without burning. How burning is it? They put the gold into fire in order to purify. Entrusted to mountain... ...it didn't get. ...entrusted to stone it didn't get... ...entrusted to sea it didn't get... ...fire didn't get, soil didn't get the earth and sky didn't get... ...but human got... ...human got and became superior to devil... ...human got and became superiorto angel... Someone, who makes this is God. God. God. Everybody can't obtain whatever he wants. But the people who want to obtain can obtain. You have got a wisdom but. Look someone who is not saying but someone who makes him to say. Someone knew body as god who was destroyed. Someone knew god as god who was saved from calamity. Someone who saves is God. God. God. With the name of protector and forgiven god. Hello to you dear profit. Hello to you, god's lover. Godness my god.

Salutation to you my god. Salutation to our profit Muhammed Mustafa. Come to me Selman. Come to me come. Everybody can't keep the secret ofimmortality. Only brave person can. - Are you on the way to keep that? - Yes. - Are you ready to swear for love? - Yes. - Are you ready to die for love? - Yes. You'll face deep walleys. - You'll face wild animals. - Yes. - You'll be hungry... You'll be thirsty... - Yes. There isn't any way to return from this love and no treachery. - There is no rebellion, no doubt. - Yes... Yes... - There is no hesitation. - Yes. If not, you'll be destroyed. Yes. So, repeat after me. - My god. - My god. I know and I believed in. I know and I believed in. Have me attain to this secret. Make me someone who saw your face.
