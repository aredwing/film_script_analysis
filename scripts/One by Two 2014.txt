Stop following me around! - Ok, enough! Where the air is intoxicating Where the ambience is like a drug Where the earth indulges in madness And the sky sways to it's own beat Shine a lantern, light the way Search your heart out You ain't gonna find another place like this Where even the moon goes for a vacation That's the kind of city I live in. Everyone's busy running the rat race Life's currency is right here So is the change Why waste it on unhappiness When it's the little moments that count. Everyone's alone in the crowd Following their own little trail Shine a lantern, light the way Search your heart out You ain't gonna find another place like this Where even the moon goes for a vacation That's the kind of city I live in. - A drink in the name of affection. -(Bravo! Bravo!) A drink in the name of affection A drink in the name of love A drink in the name of affection A drink in the name of love - A drink in the name of the faithful -(Excellent! Bravo!) A drink in the name of the faithful A whole damn bottle in the name of the unfaithful Excellent! Excellent! You're great! And the entire alcohol shop in the name of friends. Well done Sir, excellent! - Thank you for suffering through that. That was my Uncle - (Assistant Commissioner of Police)ACP Dhawan, our family's self-proclaimed King of Comedy. And up next is Inspector Chowgle. Whose poem is titled "Round and Round, what's this I Found?" Round and Round, what's this I found? For you, a familial love abounds Round and Round what's this I found? Sometimes a roti, sometimes a chapatti, Sometimes a wrap, sometimes a roll WOW! Round and Round, what's this I found? Round and Round, what's this I found? Precious to my plate Precious to my plate From the fields of Punjab and Haryana, A harvest so great. Listen hard to my lines, Experience the pain oh so fine! Of each grain milled with harsh stone Of each grain milled with harsh stone, Into the fire of my cooktop it's thrown The dough as soft as satin The dough as soft as satin A gastronomical ecstasy only you can imagine And all round there is only one chant - Round Round, What's this I found, Round Round, What this I found. (Bravo! Bravo!) - Thank You. Well Done! And now Hawaldar More It's said that if you truly love someone, you should set them free. If they come back, then it's true love. But if Inspector Chowgle frees her round and round roti, The stray dogs in the alley below will rip the roti to shreds Hungrily attack that poor round thing and won't even bother to burp after. And the next day, Poor Inspector Chowgle's round and round true love will be reduced to round and round turds. I actually feel the pain of that roti because my girlfriend left me. She shook up my world like some earthquake, hurricane, landslide under which I'm buried, and I can't even breathe. My body has turned blue. My heart's stopped beating. The blood in my veins has frozen like liquid nitrogen, frozen liquid nitrogen that's soon gonna burst strewing little fragments of me here, there, everywhere. (Everywhere! Everywhere!) Bravo! Bravo! Excellent! And look at him Hey, my favourite delinquent! Everything 0k? We too were once young, Confusing love and lust a whole bunch Then age and experience took over When the pretty young things called us seniors. To protect our sanity we ran for cover Kudos ACP Sir!

Like bubbles floating in the air Like sunshine in the winter gloom Like all the seasons in one Never had this feeling before That's as sharp as a razor blade Makes you take pride in one's own stupidity Everyone knows the feeling but the reason remains hidden That's the secret I'm talking about. Why does being in love feel so good? Who knows the reason why Has it happened for real Or is it just wishful thinking? Wishful thinking... Wishful thinking... Wishful thinking... - Get off! - Why?-Get off! What are you trying to do? Nothing at all. What was that all about? We're not together, remember? I don't own you, you don't own me.

I have a BA with honours from the London Contemporary Dance School concentrating on jazz and contemporary dance. Till recently I was part of The Jonathan Rebello Dance Company here in Mumbai. Such a heavy accent? Where are you from? From Mumbai but I was born and brought up in England You speak mostly in English. But in this show you'll have to speak in Hindi Or else the audience won't be able to understand you. And then they won't vote for you. How will you do it? This is a Dance show. Dance is a universal language Ok, let's begin. So, How did it go? 'Sot in! I got in! I got in! I got in! Amu! Mom, I'm showering. So? So may I get some privacy? What? You going to teach me about privacy now? Anyway, listen... You have to get Shishika from Prabhadevi tonight at 9. Get Shishika? How much ransom should I ask for?

Mom! the door! Some people hold back trying to create a good first impression. I'm not one of those. So you like creating a poor impression of yourself? Are all yourjokes like this? No, some are terrible. Wanna hear them? No, thanks. So your mom told me your girlfriend recently dumped you Don't worry. We'll live... Happily Ever After. Thanks. So, you're not harbouring some fantasy, are you? That he'll see you on TV and come back into your life? He doesn't reply to my emails, the hell he's gonna watch me on TV. Should we order soup? Manchow? I can't have an entire soup to myself, Cause I also want a salad. One by Two? You wanna share a soup with me? Chinese soups are quite large and with One by Two, You get a little extra free. Added bonus. And so what if he comes back into my life because of the TV show? What's wrong with that? I wrote a song in college About One by Two Not on soups... On relationships. Meaning it's a big world out there And you're just floating along in your individual soupy bowls. You're one half of a partnership and yet you're not one but two people Bonus, just like sharing a soup One by Two. So what's the use of swimming alone when you can get a swimming partner? You talking about Tomato Basil soup or chicken soup? Ok, sorry. You wanna share a soup, right? So what's with the long, boring lecture? Waiter! Yes? Manchow soup. One by Two? Actually, make mine Hot and Sour. Not really a fan of Manchow. - Mummy Mum, it's only for twenty weeks. - I know. But we've never lived apart Not even for a day. Don't know how I'll say bye.

So you're saying you will let him move out if he gets married? I don't think so Mrs.Sharma! That logic is flawed. Sushil, stop your running commentary. Ranjan Sadanah? Now look what you've done! So basically Madame Radhika dumped you for a successful man like Ranjan Sadanah? So that he would give her TV career a jumpstart? Right? Right? And I know how to fix it. Fix what? Your relationship? No, no listen... You remember that ...Debu! My names not Debu! It's Debashish. You remember that joint project we did for the Mumbai Cyber Crimes cell? Yes...we did it to show how terrorists can hack the electoral and create havoc in the elections! How did we do it? We coded it in such a way that the top 3 candidates became the bottom 3 candidates. So the winner loses the election. Winner loses Dance Wars Loser wins Dance wars And Ranjan Sadanah can kiss his job goodbye. Look... Cygnus software, Cygnus code, Cygnus servers. Get your hacking fingers ready! Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to the first round of Dance Wars. A dance show with a difference. Every week, the contestants will showcase a variety of dance forms.

Look, look - you're the English Hen, I'm the Wild and Happy Rabbit. Neither one of us wants to share their sob story. That's what people don't get. They can't understand us. So that makes them nervous. They get the spiced up, blown up sob story that's endlessly repeated like some stuck record, then they've found your weak spot. They think they know how to get to you. They're ready to steam roll you. You're no longer competition for them. And that's how the game is played. So what's your sob story. Hey...you pick up fast, girl! You're one heck of a Smart girl! That's why I said...you and I, we rule. So? So, next up is the couples round. None of these sad cases are going to partner with us. So we need to get tight, you get it? Deal? That's the way.

Bravo! Bravo That was ACP Dhawan, Our resident comedien. And up last is Inspector Shetty whose poem is titled "That Dark, Lonely night." And everyone, before you leave, Don't forget to sample tonight's Chinese buffet brought to you courtesy of Shehnaz caterers. Hello! Good evening! Good tidings! Just like a lonely moonless night... Uncle, you have to stop this now. Hey you product of a bored night, I've just gotten started. I'm starving! I'm not talking about the food. I'm talking about your shallow and empty poetry. Listen to Inspector Shetty. That's real poetry. "Are you high') - High? ' Let me check your pupils. Uncle! Chilli sauce in my eye! No, you're not high. You're just an idiot. Why is my poetry shallow? Because I don't run for cover every time I fire my own gun like that Shetty over there. Death comes closer and closer... My poetry is entertaining. Everyone enjoys it. I have no intention of walking around like I have the world's problems on my shoulders. Life's too short. And anyway, who made you The Bard That you're critiquing my poetry! You haven't been able to write squat since that Radhika drove you into the ground. Tell me? You know, you're right. I'll get her back and then I'll write. I'll write the best song ever! You're an idiot. Hey Salgaonkar, my nephew's an idiot. - Let him be. - I'm not an idiot. Ok, but listen carefully... I've passed the police academy, shot the faces off of seven gangsters and last night I showed a drug dealer what real pain is. What have you done in your life? I can't exactly answer that question now But I will...soon... And listen, if that drug dealer turns out to be yours - first I'll string him up, then I'll hang you upside down. Don't worry uncle! I don't buy my stuff... ' grow it! Grows it! Radhika! Radhika! Amit? What the hell are you doing here? Have you gone crazy? I love you. We broke up two months ago. Have you forgotten? It's over! Go home. - No. - No? So you plan on staying out here all night? Yes. You toked up tonight? Are you high? Why is everyone asking me that question? Because you're acting crazy. I am...crazy for you. Good for you! Listen, it's late at night. You can't do this. I have neighbours! Amit, Stop it! Stop it! I can't listen to this crap anymore. Amit, I can't be with you. We can never be together. You know why? Because you're boring! You're so boring! You have a boring job, You have a boring personality. A boring sense of style. You write boring songs. Even your name is boring - Amit Sharma! I mean, c'mon! What are you saying baby? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? What wrong with you! You're an embarrassment to yourself. Do you know in the last two years, how many times I almost died of boredom? Do you know? And this Manchow Soup fetish! What is a Manchow soup, Amit? Do me a favour - Go to a restaurant, order a Manchow soup. Go One by Two. Drink one bowl And drown yourself in the other. Really? You really want to do this? I'm standing here with my guitar, opening myself up to you And you're just insulting me? I can't deal with this. Really! You know what, Mihir was right. I deserve better. Go, go away - I don't care. But you please stay. This is more entertaining than TV! - W h at? - W h at? - W h at? - W h at? - W h at? - W h at? - W h at? - W h at? Hello? Hello, Samara? Yeah? It's Ramesh Mahtani Oh, Hi...Hello...Good morning. Good morning. It's been a while. Yeah... I'm coming to Mumbai for some work. Was wondering if you'd be free for dinner tonight? Yeah! But how did he know? I mean...how? I've been emailing him...l mean... You know, just keeping in touch. Well, I guess it will be nice to see him after all these years. How long has it been? About ten years. Ten years... Mum, you look beautiful! Wow! And you look so young! We look like sisters. Liar! He's here! Oh Samara, you look lovely! - Kalpana - Hi, Ramesh. - You look good. - Thank you. The house looks nice. I made a good investment. Shall we? I've made reservations for 9 o'clock. Yes... - I'll just get my bag. - Kalpana, I... Yes? I only came to take Samara for dinner... Sorry, Kalpana... No, no...of course. I understand. Sorry for the misunderstanding. You two have a lovely time. - Shall we? - Uhuh Bye mum. Bye... I can't believe you remember that. I came to one of your ballet recitals. When I was fourteen! You know, you shouldn't have gotten eliminated from that TV show. I thought you were the best dancer on the show. You saw the show? Of course. You told me about it. So I had to see it. So what are your plans now? Haven't really decided anything. I quit my dance company And I don't want to go back. Well, then you shouldn't. I'm actually surprised you're trying to be a dancer here. Why aren't you in London? You're a British citizen. Why are you here? Mum is here. Ah, I see. So, how is Kalpana doing? She's good. And that problem of hers? She misses you. I miss you. Samara, Kalpana and I, that's the past. You know what the situation was. Look, what happened between Kalpana and I has nothing to do with us. I would like to be a part of your life. I would like to make up for some of those lost years. I would really, really love that. And I'm going to make sure that I help you in getting where you want to be. I'm really going to do that, Samara. Thank you! But Samara, I don't think you need to deal with Kalpana's problems. You have to take back your own life. I don't understand. Sometimes distance is the most sensible solution. Perhaps for your mother and you. And for us. A new beginning. You know, one shouldn't go into the sea. Why? Because you'll either step into shit Or get E-coli. That's deep. What's deep? The shit or the sea? No, your shiteous enlightenment. You stand under her window with your guitar to sing, get totally bamboozled by her and then come here to share your turd philosophy expecting that we'll applaud you or give your sympathy? You're a player. From the bottom of my heart, you're the king! No, you know what you are? What? You're a potato. A big, fat potato. You let her peel you, slice you, deep fry you. Then you got salt sprinkled on your wounds To be served and eaten up by her. And she did. She enjoyed you with ketchup and mayo. But did you enjoy the experience of being chewed up, swallowed and shat out like this Look at you. Your potato-ness is just mashed up pulp! Life's just shit. Hmmm... I'm shit. Actually yeah, you know what - I'm shit I want fries. Does anyone else want French fries? Don't worry Amit. There are plenty other fish in the sea. Yeah, all dying and suffocating in the Shit-choked waters. Seriously Guys, now what? Eat, Piss, Shit and Die, what else! You look like a witch from one of those horror films. You should be ashamed of yourself. My son is a pervert. Chintu, say something. What should I say? You've made me sit the dark for the last 2O minutes! Arrest him. Where are you going? To hell. Want to join me? What were you doing in my bedroom? Why? Do I need your permission for everything? I'm you mother after all. Look what I got for you. Underwear. Your underwear was in a desperate state - Loose, covered in holes! Look at this one. Stretchable with Lycra. Those DVD's were under my mattress. Why were you putting the underwear under my mattress? I was dusting You were snooping around. I was not snooping. Good thing I did. At least I got to know about your seedy habits. My own son! My own son! Get married. What? Good boys from good families get married. They don't watch pornography. Get married to Shishika. Say Yes! Shishika! Shitshika! Say yes or I'll give you a tight slap. Ok. Now may I please use the bathroom? The Engagement will be next month. And the wedding in two months. My word. My law. Shit! You have no alternative. Get married. Hey Bhaskar! Yes, Sir! Who eats Sev-Puri for breakfast? You going to give me an antacid for dessert now? This was all there was. - Scram! - Ok! I thought I had a good thing going with Radhika, Uncle. I thought she and I loved each other. But she was just tolerating me. Maybe this is the best option. Shishika is here. So am I. May I should just marry her. - It's the next logical step, right? - Right! If you're hungry, why bother baking bread? Eat the flour, drink some water... And stick yourself in the oven. Logical! - Were you trying to insult me? - What? Samara and her father live happily ever after. That's your fairytale, right? That he'll look after you? Make your dreams come true? Anyway, what are you doing with your life? Eat, swim, sleep, gym Must be nice to have such an easy life, right! Maybe you should stop before you say something you regret. You shouldn't have gone for dinner with him alone. You should have insisted - Either the two of us or no one. But no, you just stood there not saying a word, stars shining in your eyes. You were thrilled right? Just so Pathetic! You're drunk. Don't you dare talk to me like that! But it's the truth. You promised me you'd stop. You're drunk now! You're drunk all the time! How dare you! What are you doing? - Where are the rest? - What? Samara! Samara! Samara! Samara! Stop it! What are you doing? Have you gone crazy! Stop it! Give it to me. - Give it to me - No Give it to me! No, this - this has to stop! Enough! No! You have a problem! What are you trying to say? That I'm an alcoholic? I never said that. All I said was that you have a problem. I'm tried of tip-toeing around you, afraid I'll say something wrong and you'll go straight for the Whisky bottle! I'm tired of looking after you all the time asking my friends for help. What? You talk to your friends about me? Like I'm some child? Exactly! You're the mother, not me. Who is looking after me? So all this time you were looking after me? Why do you think I'm here and not in London pursuing my dancing career. Because I don't believe you can remain sober. All you do is drink. Maybe you're here because you can't make it in London. Maybe you're not good enough! And maybe you thought in Mumbai it would be very easy. Thank you, Mum. Thanks for that. You think it's easy being a single mom? Do you know how many sacrifices I've made for you? No, I don't. You don't. Tell me! You don't know. Oh, that you are a rich industrialist's mistress? - Stop it! Oh, sorry - by being rich married industrialist's mistress! You watch what you're saying, ok! Watch it. Or maybe you sacrificed a lot when you told me that my father had died in a car crash. - Enough! And for 2O years I called my own dad Uncle Ramesh! And now that he wants me in his life, not you you take it out on me? You think you can't achieve the success you deserve because of me? Then I won't be in your way anymore. I'll be the mom and you be the child for once like you wanted. So just go... Go? Yes, Go! Go! get out of my life Mom? No, no, no I can't stand being the reason for your failure. I release you of any and all responsibilities towards me. Go! You're free! Go! I don't want to see you again! Mom? Don't worry. Everything will be ok. Come here! Thanks! Madam! Champagne? Oh my gosh! You forgot all about me, didn't you? No! Samara! Go. We'll chat later! Madam. Samara! Lovely to see you! - Meet Simran. - Hi! And Promila. - Hello! Promila, this is Samara Patel. She is a really fine dancer from London. In fact, she recently did a TV show Dance Wars! She was absolutely riveting. Samara Promila is the chairperson of the India Arts and Culture Foundation. - Oh, wow! Pleasure to meet you! - Likewise Ramesh since when did you start watching reality series on TV? I've known Samara since she was born. She's a very old family friend's daughter. In fact she's part of the family. I'm sure she's a great role model for your daughters Nandita and Raksha? Nandita graduates this year, right? Yes, in fact she's off to Harvard next year for her MBA. Cheers! I'm going to take full credit for her intelligent genes But her mother has other ideas though. Come, meet my group - Tiny Drops. We have visiting International DJs, dance teachers and new dancers all the time. We'll really rock it. Bunty, my life's a little complicated right now. Complicated? If there weren't any people, the world would be such a simple place, right! If there weren't any people, we wouldn't exist either right. Oh Burn! Clever girl! Who is this? My friend - Anika. Friend? You slept with her? What? Look, whatever's going on between the two of you, sort it about before the wedding. I hate unnecessary drama! So embarrassing. There is nothing going on. Anyway- Do you play the guitar or is it just for decoration? For decoration. So funny! Play something. You going to sing the whole thing? If you play the whole thing. Where have you come from? Prabhadevi! You fetched me from my building, remember? So funny you are! Samara, there's no bar here. - I'll get some drinks from downstairs, 0k? - Ok. Find us a place to sit. Are you going to sip that one beer all evening? So boring! I know. You're not the first girl to say that. Don't whine so much. Be a man! I love this song. Let's go dance. I don't dance. Come. Let's go I don't dance! So don't. Stand on the dance floor as decoration just like your guitar. I will dance. Excuse me! Excuse me! Sorry! Oh, shit! - Hey. This is the men's room. - Oh, shut up! Oh shit! - Excuse me! Excuse me! - Yeah? Could you pass some toilet paper? This cubicle is all out. Yeah, sure. This is the men's toilet, right? - Thanks Is it? I had no clue! Oh shit. I'm in the ladies toilet. Relax! It's the men's. So what are you doing here? Sometimes, one just needs control over things in one's life, anything. I mean anything at all like being able to pee when I want to pee. I know what you mean. And then there was no toilet paper. When life throws shit at you, you should have enough toilet paper to clean it up. Oh Really? I always thought that when life throws shit at you, throw it right back, - Throw it right back..huh... -but yours is better. - Hmm...interesting. That's not bad. - Anyway, I have to go. - Yours is better - Thanks for the toilet paper! Hey, no, no, no... wait...hold on.. listen...wait... Clean that shit up! Clean that shit up! Taxi! Drunken idiot. Why don't you buy a car? Prabhadevi! What's the use of living measure by measure? That should be some difference between life and a dry goods store. Life is like a flowing stream. Why breathe as if we're frozen in an ice storm. Life is not lived stuck in narrow alleys. We need to spread our wings in open fields. Why can't just a smile be the answer to life? Why can't love be the ultimate goal? Experience each day like it's a precious gift. What's the use of living measure by measure? That should be some difference between life and a dry goods store. Uncle, you wrote this poem? Can't believe it, right? - How? - I won two hundred thousand! You know that TV show Dance Wars? I bet on a dancer to win. Salgaonkar had started a pool in the office and I won two hundred thousand! Looks like I'm the poet in the family, not you How do you say it in English Life is beautiful! And look this is for you. For me? Enjoy! Hey you Juvenile delinquents! What are you doing, you Devils! Stop! Stop! You ok uncle? Forget it. I'm in love with life. Who knows from where inspiration can come. Your facial software clearly shows That this program is not happy. Of course I'm ok. No, you're not happy. And that Radhika, she just helped you cover up the problem - a temporary bandage If infection sets in, then changing the bandage will do no good. Better pop some antibiotics, because if the leg catches Gangrene, then... Understood? C'mon! Amit! Sir! In my office, now! The Mahtani project is due in 2 weeks and I see no progress at all. What's the problem? - Amit, I need a god damn... - Sorry, sir...Sorry! Now look here Amit, I have high expectations from you. In this entire department, you're my only shining hope. Do you know that? Thank you Sir You're capable, you're talented. You need to work... You just need to work hard and... remove some bad influences from your life both of them. I want to see you in this chair in 25 years. In this chair. So you'd better buck up. Yes, Sir. - Buck up my boy. - Yes, sir You know, I think he actually looks better. This is great! Mihir! 25 years...to move ten feet... from here to there. 25 years! What's the matter? What's happened? What's the matter? What's happened? Why has my life turned upside down? What's the matter? What's happened? The minutes weigh down like never before. Why am I suffocating, the walls closing in, Why does it seem like I owe a debt to the world Time passes by like a prison sentence Who knows what destiny has in store I have everything yet nothing Living life like this is like not living at all Who? Who's there? Thieves? - It's me, Dad. - Oh! What happened? Are you haPPY? Happy? Why? Do we have to get happy right now? Huh? As in, if you've got some good news, then we'll get happy. No, do you remember the last time you were happy? Hey, when was Khemkar's birthday? He got some new kind of cake chocolate bomb. On my next birthday, please don't get that boring pineapple cream Bomb? What kind of a thing is that to eat? I have everything yet nothing Living life like this is like not living at all What's the matter? What's happened? Amit! Amit! Amit! Amit! Amit! Amit! Amit! Amit! Amit! I think we need to talk. What has happened to you? Talk to us. We're here for you. Amu! Are you ready? What is this? The same old rotting, torn boxers? Why aren't you ready? Shishika and her parents are waiting outside. Quickly wear your sherwani. The auspicious time for the engagement is running out Why aren't you getting ready? Why are you sulking in here? You'll get a job. Trust me! I love you! C'mon! Help me! Help me! Help me! There's lots of work! Hot-hot samosas! - Some chutney for you? - Yes! Thank you! He likes singing...playing the guitar...that's why... - Guitar - Yes! Have you ever seen a turtle wearing shoes All decked up in a suit and tie? Have you? Have you? Have you? Well then, look at me...look carefully at me! Whatever I do, turns out upside down My brains get pickled, has gotten pickled! I'm just burned out! Rogered from behind! My love left me, on the arms of another, She went, she left, she ran away. Waving at me from a distance. I'm that goat that gets slaughtered alive, That gets sent to the gallows... and hung. A shovel up my behind. Eaten alive. I'm just burned out! Rogered from behind! What kind of a youth is this Where all you face is the daily grind. Am I a person or a puppet? I'm just burned out! Rogered from behind! Grilled! Smashed! Bruised! Beaten! I'm just burned out! Amu, what has happened to you? What happened to me? Your whole life, all you keep hearing is Think outside the box, think outside the box, think outside the box! Shhh!!!! What are you doing? But if that box is stuck in a hole 2O feet deep, How the hell are you going to get out? It's not possible! All you can do is keeping taking circles around that box -your whole life! - Stop Are your parents dead? You couldn't come talk to us? You never said you didn't want marry Shishika Or anyone else for that matter. So what is all this about? Keeping everything locked up inside And then one day exploding like a bomb. And that's what it is. Very good! Ten out of ten. Son, if you don't want to work in It, don't! If you don't want to marry, don't! You don't know this new generation. Everything is so complicated. Everything leads to depression and stress for them. Son, listen life isn't that complicated. It's very simple. Yeah mom, I get it. I get it. Damn it! - She's looking so pretty... - Very sweet... Just remember...if I do anything like else ever... Just remember that, 0k? MY kinky minx! Don't you ever let me lose the plot like that. Never! Just so that you remember! I knew it! Oh...What? That you would do something ridiculous like this. That's why I picked you. Marriage is such a waste of time. Now my parents will finally leave me alone. Smart! If you ever want to decorate a dance floor, call me! Bye! Samara, Samara, Samara! Look at this! That Dance Wars of yours Some finalist, lmran, broke his leg... basically he's out. Now they're going to pick a wild card entry From one of the previous rounds for the finale. Good for them! Samara, at least show some excitement! Whatever! Fine!

Me? Yeah! You'll do a great job! You telling the truth? Hey, someone's Hindi skills have improved! So, shall we do it? Like bubbles floating in the air Like sunshine in the winter gloom Like all the seasons in one Never had this feeling before That's as sharp as a razor blade Makes you take pride in one's own stupidity Everyone knows the feeling But the reason remains hidden That's the secret I'm talking about. Why does being in love feel so good? Who knows the reason why Has it happened for real Or is it just wishful thinking? Love doesn't listen to reason. - It spins a web and traps you in - Wishful thinking Knowingly you get tricked - Into falling in it's trap - Wishful thinking Love doesn't listen to reason. - It spins a web and traps you in - Wishful thinking Knowingly you get tricked Into falling in it's trap.

Who knows the reason why Has it happened for real Or is it just wishful thinking? Love doesn't listen to reason. It spins a web and traps you in Knowingly you get tricked - Into falling in it's trap! -17 million hits! - Wishful thinking How could we take anyone else? You deserve to be our wild card entry.

It's really amazing. Thanks! So this song will be for the finale. The winner will be announced, the celebrations will begin and your song will play, leading out the show. Leading out the show? Really! Wow! I don't know what to say! Thanks! I was missing you. - You're not supposed to be here. - I know. No, Nobody saw me! I was missing you! - Amit, I... - Hmmm... I was wrong. I was so wrong. Will you ever be able to forgive me? I made a huge mistake, Amit. I love you. I need you. Please take me back. Please, please, please take me back. Radhika, I...you know I... Amit! It's ok...you can take your time. I don't need your answer right now... but just remember that I love you. WOW! - This would be a mistake. - What? - This - No...this is not a mistake. The mistake was what we did, Amit. We shouldn't have broken up. Whatever you and I did back then...that's in the past. It doesn't really matter now. We won't talk about that...blank page We start from the beginning, 0k? - Radhika, what I meant was... - Amit... - I don't... - Amit, no... It's like you're at home... And you feel the world is beckoning you... that the outside world is where it's at. So you leave everything and go travelling to find yourself. But then you realize that home is home. You're my home, Amit. I had to come back to you. That is...that's very sweet... But Radhika, now I want to travel the world. - But... - No, Radhika. This time it's well and truly over. But I'll still compose that song for your show, if you still want it. I don't really have a choice. My bosses want it. And that song that you're so in love with today? 8 years ago I sung it at the YR College fest for you... and you don't even remember it. So, are you ready for some good news? Oh! Yeah! You're looking at the new director of the Amsterdam Repertory Dance company! Oh my gosh! Congratulations! That's amazing! So, shall we go? Where? Amsterdam! Where else? I'll visit, For sure I'll visit! Not to visit. To live. You and I. Why are you laughing? Jonathan, how can I go? C'mon Samara! You win the dance competition, you can start your dance company there. It's going to be exciting. World class dance, great music, cafAs I can almost see it. You and me in Amsterdam. So romantic! No, I can't go. My life is here. Samara, till when will you keep making excuses? Excuses? You know, you have to sort out your own life. Fine, agreed, your dad never acknowledged you And your mom has problems... Till when will you keep hiding behind these excuses, feeling sorry for yourself! Sorry for myself? Why are you getting angry? You're old enough to hear the truth. Samara? C'mon, what happened? Get out. Don't act crazy. I'm not going anywhere, ok! Fine! C'mon Samara, sometimes in, sometime out... Sometimes this, sometimes that... What do you want? Just leave me alone! Where do you think you're going? - Move. - Get back right now - Get out of my way. - Get back right now! Hello? Mom? Hi baby... Mom... What's the matter? Enough...enough... - I'm sorry...I'm so sorry... - Doesn't matter... Cry, cry...get it all out... - Mom? - Hmmm... Did it hurt a lot when he ended it? It would have, but you were there for me... It made everything ok. - Baby? - Hmm... I really want to stop drinking. I've been trying for the last month...l tried hard but... We're going to do it together... You and I, we're a team. Yes...yes, we're a team. Forever and ever and always... Forever. Together, the pieces form a pretty picture... But the each piece itself is a beautiful composition. One might even say... Samara come in. What song is this? This song is for the finale. It will play after the winner is announced... but I don't think it's right. Sounds good to me. We can use it somewhere. Time and money has been spent. It wasn't for free. What's wrong with it? So then...may I use it? Ladies and Gentlemen, Patrons and Connoisseurs... Hold on to your seats... In just a few minutes, there will be a spectacular competition between Samara and Kumsum and today itself, on this very stage the new Dance Wars Champion will be crowned. So are you ready? No, no...l can't hear you guys... Let's try this one more time...Are you ready? That's what I'm talking about! Samara, someone is here to see you... Mr.Ramesh Mahtani.

That's another one million rupees for your dance school. So, do we have a deal? I won't leave mum. Samara, Kalpana and I... Look, you weren't fair to her. Mum loved you and you took advantage of that. You should have let her go. You ruined her chance at happiness. You ruined her life. It's too late now. I don't believe in fairytales anymore. Real life is so much better. Ladies and Gentlemen... It's time for our second finalist Samara Patel! Together, the pieces form a pretty picture... But the each piece itself is a beautiful composition. One might even say... One could even say... It may be jeweled and disguised but it's still a chain that binds Life is a gamble, who would have believed it... But the game had better not take over. The journey is long... And there is only invocation that escapes the lips... That this lost soul doesn't take a wrong turn God forbid, God forbid... God have mercy. God forbid. You Rock Samara! Love you Samara! Samara Go for it! God forbid, God forbid... God have mercy. God forbid. - There she is! - C'mon slowpoke! And the moment we've all been waiting for The winner of The Dance Wars Championship is Samara has disappeared. Announce Kusum as the winner. Kusum Kanwar! We didn't even rig it this time and still it's the wrong result? - Shit is all around us! - Shut up! That's getting boring now! Such good music... On the table if I had had my way, I would danced... Mihir is the one who brought me down... What happened? Toilet...you go ahead. I'll catch up. - Hey, Amit? - Yeah? - Gotta take a dump again? - Push hard! Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry! Are you 0k? Are you alright? - Samara Patel? - Yeah? It's me Amit Sharma. You just danced to my song. - Oh my god, right! - Yeah That is such a gorgeous song. Thank you so much, - I mean...Oh...blood... - What? Keep your head back. It will stop the blood flow. Maybe I should go in No, No, No...somebodyjust... you can smell it till here... You do not want to go in there. Trust me. Look. Why don't we go to the bar. They'll have napkins there and I owe you a drink. Keep your head back. By the way, I thought you deserved to win. Can I have some of this? But I did. I had enough toilet paper to clean that shit up. What? As opposed to throwing it back? Wait what? What did you say? - Amit? What did you do? What happened to him? She's always been capable of this. This is Amit. This is my mom. - Hi! This is Shaila and Bunty.
