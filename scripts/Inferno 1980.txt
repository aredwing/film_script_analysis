The experiment of the life teaches us not to accept a work without knowing the consequences of them. Me, Varelli, architect living in London, I met the Three Mothers, and drew to them and built three houses. In Rome, in New York and the third in Freiburg, in Germany . But I discovered too late that from these places, the Three Mothers control the world in the pain, tears and darkness. Mater Suspiriorum, the Mother of the Sighs and oldest, lives in Freiburg. MATER Lacrimarum, the Mother of the Sobs and most beautiful from the three, Rome directs. MATER Tenebrarum, the Mother of Darkness, young person and cruelest, New York control. I built these horrible residences, agent of these wretched secrecies. These alleged "Mothers" are in fact malefic, incompetents to create the life... The men gave them a name single and terrifying. Actually, all three were saeurs as much as mothers. But also three Muses, three Graces, three destinies and three furies. The ground on which these residences were builts could become mortal and pestifr. So that the neighbourhoods would be touched by it. This is the first key of the secrecy of the Three Mothers. A key of first importance. The second key of the poisoned secrecy of the Three Saeurs is hidden in the cellar of their house. There, you will find the portrait and the name sur which lives the house. It is the place where the second key is. The third key is under the sole of your shoes. There is the third key.. My dear Marc brother... The second key is hidden in the cellar. Good evening. I would like to speak to you about this book. Which? That that you sold to me, Three Mothers. You read it ? Partly.. This is an invention or a history drawn from real facts ? It disturbs you ? It is not that a book written by an alchemist . There are many accounts on the cursed houses... The House of the Monsters, close to Palermo. The House of Pheasants, in Brussels. The Cellender House, in France. Certaines people thinks that these books are a fiction and others believe each word of it. the women are generally the worst readers for these accounts. Or the best, if you prefer. - They want to believe absolument. in it - Not really. the book speaks about an unpleasant odor, for example. And here, around, there is this strange bitter soft odor. One says that it comes factory from cakes. I always knew it. It disturbs you? At the end of one moment, one made there, and one does not notice it even more. It is not only coincidence. - When one reads the book... - There are mysterious passages. But only the true mystery is that our lives are controlled by deaths. Good night. the second key is hidden in the cellar. ROME - APRIL And here celebrates it ch?ur Goes pensiero. Final... Third part... of Nabucco de Giuseppe Made green. My dear Marc brother... As you know it, in New York, I live an old building... Excuse me, I want to go elsewhere. "Via dei Bagni", with number 49. What a strange odor! This street empeste.

It partly takes again the newspaper which I discovered among the personal businesses of a friend, an architect and alchemist recognized of the name of Varelli. Varelli disappeared mysteriously here several years. This newspaper could help to clear up the circumstances of its death. As it was in Latin, I decided to publish it just as it is. Sarah! Closing.
