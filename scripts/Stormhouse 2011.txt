Have you actually seen it... the apparition? I'm not authorized to share that information. But I obviously know about it. That's why I'm here. Best speak to Major Lester. Okay. It's just to me this is kind of a big deal. But I thought I paid extra for the penthouse. Someone will come and take you to see the major. Wait, can I get my phone back once it's been checked out? It's been confiscated for the duration of your stay. For the whole 10 days? But I need to make daily reports to Minister McGillis. You'll be permitted to make monitored phone calls through the approved channels. Oh, hi. Hi. - I'm... do you want...? - It's all right. I'm Hayley Sands. I'm Justin. You're the... - New advisor. - Yeah yeah. - Are you ready to go or...? - Yeah. Right... you want to go now? - Yeah, if you can. - Okay, um... You're so lucky to be from Australia. Yeah, I spent some time in Melbourne, but... a couple of weeks. It was amazing. Oh, I'm actually from Melbourne. - Are you really? - Yeah yeah yeah. God, I love New York, but I always felt that, like, Melbourne was the kind of place I'd want to grow up. - Really? - Yeah. Why? I just felt like people like me would get better accepted out there. Right, people like you. Oh, don't worry. It's the E.M. Some of us still use earplugs. - Are you cool or...? - Yeah. E.M... you mean electromagnetic fields? Yeah, but reverse E.M. The whole building's soaked in it as a safety measure. Reverse E.M.? That makes sense. Ghosts manifest themselves in our world through E.M. energy. Yeah, my line manager Brandon says we're all haunted beef. Wow, I can't wait to meet him. The most intense rev E.M. is on this level, in the enclosure wires. The enclosure? That's where the entity lives? And where it stays. Major Lester, this is... I'm Hayley Sands. We're a little busy, Miss Sands. Of course. Well, I'm here to help however I can. I see you talk to ghosts... with limited success. I've had extensive firsthand experience with paranormal events. Frankly, Miss Sands, I doubt you'll be able to help us. You see, you are Whitehall's token gesture. And you may as well be an aromatherapist or a reader of tea leaves. Still, my hands are tied. So I will grant you limited access to this project. But I don't have time to waste. Simplicity is key. You understand? Any questions? So many you wouldn't believe. Well, then we'd best get some of them out of the way. Play it. Yeah. Is that the entity moving around? No, it's concentrated reverse E.M. It stops the entity from getting out. It's really happening. The footage was taken seven months ago, shortly after the entity was captured. We've not seen or heard it since. So you don't know what it is, male or female? The gender is hardly relevant. It's an asset. Okay. Well, how do you know it's still in there? Uh, we get small signs now and again... peaks in E.M., temperature fluctuations. And we put specimens in there each week. Specimens? Yeah, mice. What happens to them? Um, they die. Of course, I mean it could be the E.M. No. No, trust me. It's in there. Please let me see it tonight. Gate one accessed. Pull yourself together, man. This is a place for science. Clearing gate one. The holding area's temperature is 4. The decrease is further inside the enclosure itself. It's consistent with a phenomenon like this. What if there is a power cut? It's on a separate circuit with an automatic backup generator. Please don't go any further. Did you hear that? Has that happened before? No. Why is there a hole in the fence? The entity cannot escape. Sure, I get that... the rev E.M. But why have the hole? Miss Sands. Major, we have an EM spike. Intensity? Nothing serious. - Stay away from the enclosure. - Shh. What did it say? I couldn't make out. It's just a sound, maybe a greeting. What is that? Ice? A cold spot. It's so localized. Hope your girlfriend doesn't die. Save it. Miss Sands, I really don't recommend touching the wire. One of my men did so and is now in the psychiatric ward. Hello. I want to know everything about you. You could be from any period in history. What year did you cross over? I think that's enough for today, Miss Sands. Miss Sands. Hey, geek boy. Nah. The excitement got to you, huh? It was completely amazing. This supernatural entity was so close, I just felt like I could reach out and touch it. But I won't. Why aren't there more people around? This place feels like... I was gonna say "a ghost town." You know there's gonna be a big military operation in Iraq? Yeah, I kind of guessed that. This place has had a skeleton crew for weeks. Almost everyone got reassigned out east. Wow, since when was a ghost a low priority? Oh, this operation is a total black sheep. It's like we're an embarrassment to the military and the government. We don't exactly get cutting-edge tech. Then how did you capture this? I mean, I've talked to dead people across the divide, but how do you drag someone from the afterlife to here? Or purgatory. Look, to be honest, I don't know. I hear rumors flying about, but... Like what? Just of some secret machine they have hidden in this place, maybe in a panic room or... Wow. Did you ever ask the major? Uh, Lester won't even tell you what time it is. Seriously, try not to piss him off. Too late. Did you ever get into the holding area? Just the one night, by myself. I hardly slept for weeks after. Why is that? It whispered to me through the fence, totally creeped me out. What did it whisper? Well, I thought it said, "Play." So you're feeling better then? Well enough to kick your ass. I suck at this. We'll see. Play. So why did they pick you? The British government heard about my work at the New York Police Department. Cool. What do you do? One thing I'm good at... well, besides table tennis obviously... I help hunt serial killers and create leads for difficult cases. Cool. What's wrong? You're not laughing or looking at me funny. Why would I? Most people think I'm a freak. You're talking to a guy who voluntarily signed up for this, so... That's true. What's your excuse? I wanted to get as far away from humans as possible. Five months later... and it's good to see a friendly face. - Oh. - How good is it now? Miss Sands, come with me. So tell me exactly what happened. Well, the entity appeared to broach contact. I'm gonna try and open up an interactive line of communication tomorrow. Okay, well, I need you to keep me informed. Of course, Mr. McGillis. I appreciate that. I'm gonna just quickly call my dad. Out. How are you finding it, love? Oh, I like how you English guys call people "love." Oh yeah, it's awesome here, thanks. Well, I think I can speak for all of us when I say it's a pleasure to finally have a lady here. Well, nearly all of us. What's that supposed to mean? It means you're a nancy boy. Cut it out! Cut that shit out! Back on duty, everyone. Now! May I please ask how you captured him or her? Please try to stay focused on the task at hand. Did you use a machine to pull the soul from the afterlife? I mean, if so, it would be incredible. It could change the way we see everything. I'm afraid such information is on a strictly need-to-know basis. But I kind of do need to know. No, you merely want to. Please. Keep a close eye on her. Yes sir. Anything? Can you show me you're in there? No need to be afraid. It's feeling a little different than yesterday. Major, can you hear me over there? # Frere Jacques # # Dormez-vous? # # Dormez-vous? # # Frere Jacques # # Frere Jacques # # Dormez-vous? # # Dormez-vous? # # Sonnez les matines # # Sonnez les matines # # Din dan don # # Din dan don. # # Din dan don. # Why did you do that?

Sir, it's... it's definitely you. # Din dan don # # Din dan don... # It's using you to communicate. It's not using me. It can't be. See if that video feed's been tampered with. Do it now. So, I mean, like, if you don't mind me asking, how does someone just discover that they can talk to dead people? Sorry, you don't have to tell me. I'm just curious. No, it's fine. I was seven and I tried to talk to my mom. She died the week before. Oh shit, I'm sorry. My dad wasn't handling it very well and I felt really... Sorry, I don't normally talk about this. No, it's okay. You don't have to go on. I felt... I felt really alone. And so I picked up this invisible telephone I didn't know I had and I tried giving my dead mom a call. Only someone else picked up... some, like, old Japanese guy. And then I started talking to other people. And the rest... well, the rest is my life, so... Cool. Yeah, cool. Play. Play. Let me out. # Frere Jacques # # Dormez-vous? # # Dormez-vous? # # Sonnez les matines... # Major, please come in.

Are you trying to talk? Let me out. Who are you? What's your name? Let me out. Let me out! No. Wait. What's going on? What are you doing? Sir, what are you doing? You're out of line, you know that? Why have you stopped recording? And who the hell is that in there? Shut the fuck up and do your job. Wait. What are you doing? No. Stop it. Try to relax. Stand by for my command. No, you can't do this. You really think I caught this thing for a chat? Well, why did you catch it? You're about to see. God save me. I could feel it in my head. That thing's unholy. Stay here, okay? What are you gonna do? Sir, I really don't think this is a good idea. Really? And why should I care what you think? You'll do as you're told or be relieved of your duties. - Do you understand? - Yes sir. Lieutenant, Lance Corporal, throw the prisoner into the enclosure. - No. - Matthews, get your shit together - and secure that woman. - No! This is barbaric. Lance Corporal Rogers, assistance now. No. Before you go all liberal on us, Mr. Rourke, you may want to know who this is. This man's name is Salim Hassan. He's a convicted terrorist. Until recently he was a member of a cell linked to multiple terror attacks across Europe including targets such as hospitals, schools and airports. Whatever happens here today, no one should afford this man any kind of sympathy. He lost any rights he had when he tried to kill innocent people... women and children, families. That thing in there may be the most powerful weapon we possess. And Mr. Hassan is gonna help me to prove it. It's touching him. This is really dangerous. What are you doing? Lights back on, please. Play. Lieutenant Groves. Lieutenant Groves. Stop! All levels have returned to normal. I think it's over. Justin, I need your help. I'd say we all need help. I can't do this anymore. What happened in there was insane. Of course it was. That's why I need you to help me. They said I can't call McGillis tonight... technical issues. Please. Reverse EM barrier activated. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine, sir. Well, if Hassan won't talk now, he never will. Well, he's down at the med center having what's left of his eye patched up. When they're done, I'll have words... harsh words. Well, if he still won't give up the other members of that cell, then we'll dunk him back in tomorrow. We need to build on this. His name is Salim Hassan. Major Lester said that he was a known terrorist. They just threw him in with the entity. It was horrible. - Let me go over there. - This is all very worrying. Too late. It's done. Listen, do you want me to get you out of there? I can do it tonight. I need to stay. Okay, I've got to go, Mr. McGillis. Bye now. That was the last call. I want all lines of communication with Whitehall temporarily severed. They've been looking for a reason to shut this place down. Did you know that, Lieutenant? No, I didn't, sir, no. Yeah, that's why the girl's here. But this is our project, our asset, and we must do everything to protect it. Here's my security clearance. Well, actually it's Brandon's. He ranks higher, so I swapped them. It should get you to the detention cells. - Thank you. - Are you sure you want to do this? I have to find out what he saw in the enclosure. Just don't forget who this guy is. Five minutes. I'll be outside. I'm here to talk. Can you understand me? It was wrong, what they did to you. Do you... do you understand what I'm saying? What is it? Play. The entity is talking to you? No. Not talking. A song. # Din dan... # # Don. # It wants to play. Play. Always play. I know it will set me free. It is Allah's will. - Jesus. - Get up. - What is going on? - Get up. What is going on? Where are we going? - Get off! Help me! - Get back in your room. No. No. Miss Sands, if you work against the British military's best interest, then you must expect to be treated like a terrorist. No, you can't do this. The E.M. rising steadily, sir. Temperature down 5%. I'd say it was excited. - What are you doing? - Stand down, Mr. Rourke. - You can't do this. - The E.M. peaking. - Do it. - No! Please, no. Argh! Um... the power supply in the main holding area is down again. What about the enclosure? Emergency power holding. Switch the lights over to the secondary power supply. - I'm working on it. - Work faster. Here goes. Hayley, the fence is down. Run! Emergency. Code red. Get on the floor. Get down. Get down. Stay down. - Where is it? - Let me out! Did it get out? Mr. Faber. Let me out. I can't do this. The enclosure power coming back online. Let me out. It could now be anywhere inside that room. Increase reverse E.M. on the room's perimeter. Divert any power you can spare. I want that entire space What about the girl? Lieutenant, Private, escort Mr. Rourke to one of the detention cells. No one goes anywhere. I wasn't expecting your visit, sir. I neglected to inform Miss Sands during our bugged conversation. You're relieved, Major. Hand over your weapon. Get this man to the medical center. Move. Why is Miss Sands in there? Get her out now. I'm afraid we can't do that, sir. Why not? Miss Sands, it's Duncan McGillis. Are you all right? Please, please let me out of here. I'm told there's a chance that the holding area is contaminated. We're doing everything we can. We'll have you out of there as soon as possible. The entity is out of the enclosure. It might attack. At least let me into the tunnel. I'm sorry, but the entity may be sealed inside. Remain vigilant, Miss Sands, and bear with me. Is there any way of knowing if the entity has escaped into the holding area? It could still be in the enclosure, but unless it makes itself visible to us, we have no way of telling. I mean I could set up a series of pulses of rev E.M. around the holding area, including the tunnel. What would that do? It would act as a kind of cattle prod. We would see a reaction from the entity if it came into contact with it. That's not a good idea. Provoke the entity and it may become more dangerous. What other options do we have? We wait and observe. But there's no telling how long that will take. Unacceptable. I'm not putting that girl through any more of this. How long will it take to implement your pulse option? It will take a couple of hours. But once it's all set up, it will only take a few minutes to scan the area. Will Miss Sands be harmed? No sir. But as the major pointed out, we have no way of predicting how the entity will react. What were you doing throwing that terrorist into the cage? Are we America now? With the greatest of respect, sir, America gets results. We are too soft and heading for a 9/11 of our own. If your family were at risk, tell me you wouldn't agree with my actions. You're facing a court martial, Major. You've contravened countless human rights, not to mention put this base at risk. You will lock Stormhouse down until you are certain this thing is contained. No one comes. No one goes. Am I understood? Yes sir. Then you will escort me to the panic room. Surprised? Who do you think approves the plans and the budget for this place? Bring Miss Sands to me there and we'll wait for the rescue team to arrive. I'll need to organize the team and inform Whitehall of the situation. - Get me an outside line. - Of course, sir. Hello? Is anyone out there? Mr. McGillis. Hello? Jesus, shut up. Hey, Lieutenant. You're still on duty? Yes. What's going on? It's getting warmer in here. The temperature is going up inside the holding area. That's weird. That's not right. The temperature is going down in here. Hey, Lieutenant, will you do me a favor? Can you... can you radio the major or McGillis, tell them we've got a problem in here? Hey, are you gonna radio...? The entity is out of the enclosure. Oh God. Lieutenant Groves, with me. Lieutenant. You getting any signal through comms? No sir, no reading. Fuck. Right, you two, stay with me. Keep your fucking eyes open. You're not here anymore. Play. What's going on out there? Please remain in your room. What's all the shouting about? What's going on? Stay in your room. Who's there? Private Matthews, are you still there? Look, just stay in your room. Hey. What happened to you? Lester. The pain meds they gave me... they're wearing off. Well, let's get you some more and get you properly strapped up. No, you need to go and get help. Screw that. Let's go. Major, I thought you were in custody, sir. The entity has escaped. I remain your commanding officer. Yes sir. I want you to proceed to the mess room and establish a secure base. Understood, sir. We split up, move on to the mess. You both take the right. I'll take the left. Lance Corporal Rogers, status. Lance Corporal Rogers, respond. Have you secured the area? # Frere Jacques # # Dormez-vous? # # Sonnez les matines # # Din dan... # # Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques # # Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous? # # Sonnez les matines, sonnez les matines # # Din dan don, din dan... # Incorrect code. Access granted. Reverse EM barrier activated. Wait. Wait. Yeah? Okay. Use this. Just stay with me, okay? We'll get you the painkillers to keep you going. Just... argh! Salim, it's me. It's okay. Where are you going? We're going to the medical center. He's badly injured. Where are you going? Out. Even if you did find the lift, you wouldn't be able to leave. In emergency situations you can only activate the lift with an authorized thumbprint. You can do this? No, officer rank only. Then we must find one of these men. Allow me. How the hell are we supposed to secure this? Shut up and focus. Everyone's gone bloody quiet on comms. It's been here. Focus. All clear in here, Dan. How about you? Dan. Dan! Dan? For fuck's sake, Dan. This ain't the time for games. Shh. Bored. Oh God, no. Oh my God, no. Does this man have authorization to the exit? What? We have no time. Does he have authorization? You'd need his thumbprint. Stay here. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Oh. Give it to me. You show me the way. I will activate the lift. The lift is nearby. If we can get up top, I should be okay. We need to know we can trust you. Scan in progress. Print verified. Level nine is no longer a valid lift access point. The nearest access point is level six. - Level six? - Yeah, it's three floors above us. Somebody wants to make sure no one can reach the lift carriage. - We can use the emergency ladder. - Where is it? No, we're not going anywhere without the medication. He's not gonna be able to climb the ladder without it. - He'll have to. - You'll never make it to it alive by yourself. I know exactly where it is. We go to the med center first. Don't worry. I'm a first-aider. I feel better already. Have you found anything useful? Nothing. What did it feel like when you were in the enclosure with it? It was horrible, like a nightmare. I could feel it all over my skin, like its breath all over me. It wanted to hurt me... I mean really hurt me. It was so powerful. And I set it free. How's that? Numb as fuck, but I can move. Good. We go. I can feel it. Where? Justin, Justin, are you okay? What is it? Play. What? Play! - It has him. - No. - Come on. - No. Justin, can you hear me? - Leave him. - No. Yes, Justin hear you. Is that you talking? Leave him alone. No. Justin want to fuck you in your dirty little cunt. No. Get away from him. Come. Let him go. Yes. Justin go. Watch. Hayley, help me, please. Hang on, please. Hang on. Come on, let's go. All gone. Play? No. Justin. No. No. Justin. - Come on. - Let go. No. Let go. No. Get off me. No, get off, no. We could have saved him. Enough. That thing killed him inside. You know this. I said enough. This was a mistake. I have a map now. No. It would be mercy for me to kill you, but it can have you. It is my friend. It understands me. Scan in progress. Oh no. No. Justin... Play. Print verified. Lift activated. No. Go fetch, my friend. Scan in progress. Print verified. Lift activated. Please. Oh my God. Play. All right. Play. Ground level. Playtime's over, right? I said it's over. It's fucking over! No! No, wait, no! That's my ball! Give back the ball. Come back! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Why am I in here? The entity is gone. It wasn't yours to give away. I just couldn't take it anymore. I forgive you. Anyway... You're going to help me to replace it. You want me to help you operate the machine? I can do that... if you let me go. That's the plan, right... bring the spirit back with the machine and put it in here? You're standing in my machine. What? This is how my machine works. No. Please, no. No. You mean...? You see, you always thought you needed to know, Miss Sands. And now you finally do. My operation must continue. Don't do this. And my country must be protected. No. No, please.
