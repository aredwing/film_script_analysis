Look, we've got every major drunk from Mardi Gras down here. There's no room. He tried to give me a speeding ticket. Just make it happen. Yes, sir. How are we doing, Winslow? Morning, Sheriff. Well, New Orleans PD sent us another handful to hold overnight and Hamilton is out at Sable Ranch. Again? All in all, not that bad a year. Honestly, not bad at all. Oh, she's got a gun! I killed him. Drop the gun, now! Get on the floor, now! Arms up. On the floor! Spread 'em! Wait, she has something in her hand. What is it? Oh, god! It's a fucking scalp. Who-Who'd you kill? They're all dead. Who's dead? Honey Island Swamp. I need an available boat unit out to Honey Island Swamp now. Hamilton, are you there? I killed him. I killed him. Any injuries? Nothing noticeable, sir. Are you trying to tell me that none of that blood is hers? How many bodies did you say there were? Twenty, thirty. And you're the only one who made it? Just a few scratches? No major injuries, huh? You see how this could look just a tiny bit suspicious, don't you? there is no answer at the Dunston house. Try again. I have. Five times. Well then get in your car and drive over there, Deputy Elbert. Yes, sir. I'm on it. Nobody's home. Crowley killed them all. Enough about Victor Crowley. We know who Victor Crowley is. And we also know what reality is. So, let me see if I got this straight. You suspected Victor Crowley of killing your father and your&? - Brother. - Brother, right. So you jumped in a swamp tour boat, an illegal swamp tour boat, and headed back out into the swamp armed with nothing but a handgun. A ghost wiped out everyone in front of you. You found out that your family was dead and you barely escape with your life. But then the next night, you go back out into that same swamp, chase that same damn ghost and you bring more people with you? Now why would you do something like that? That has to be the stupidest story and some of the most idiotic and contrived decision making I've ever heard. I am telling you the truth. I don't think you realize the kind of deep shit you're in, little girl! You come into a goddamn police station covered in someone else's blood, head to toe, you're carrying a weapon and a piece of somebody's fucking head! And the best you got for me for an alibi is some kind of urban legend? Hey! I am talking to you. Let me tell you something. You go up in front of the judge you better come up with a better excuse than what's- - Sheriff, come in. - Yeah, I'm here. Sir, it's, uh& What is it, Hamilton? Spit it out! It's a fucking massacre out here, sir. I mean, we've only covered about 40 yards and we already come up with four bodies. I mean, I mean& Jesus, they don't even have faces, Louis. Look, we're gonna have to call in every goddamn paramedic in the state and a full recovery team right away. We're talking about DNA and dental records level shit out here, man. Shit, they're going to have only teeth though. Uh, we got a girl in custody. Uh, I'm on my way. Uh, we're gonna call in state, Sheriff. we're dealing with down here. Shit, we keep finding pieces everywhere. I said, I am on my way, Deputy. Sir, do you want me to go? Get the fire and paramedics out there right away. I'm on it. This is Deputy Winslow. I need all available... These dead bodies ain't finding themselves. Come on now. Double time. an official comment till there's been a full investigation I'll probably gonna be out there all day-what? Sheriff, I think you have a, uh- Shit. Hi, Louis. - Okay, seriously- - I need this. I need this, Louis. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, come on. Multiple bodies, Honey Island Swamp, girl in custody. That is police business, okay? Oh, this has Victor Crowley written all over it. Are you out of your mind? Please let me on that scene. Let me cover this story. Get in line. I've been a punch line on the media blacklist for my Crowley study. This is an opportunity for me. Crowley study? Is that what you're calling it right now? I thought it was more like, uh, obsessive sensationalism. Now, you just listen here. I want it. I would like to have the access. Please, let me break this story. Please, Louis. all we know is there's a possible murder outside of Jefferson Parish. No further comment. I heard massacre. I heard unidentified bodies in pieces. - Jesus H Christ Amandai, - Faces missing? that is a police frequency. Stay off of it. I have First Amendment rights, Louis. Come on. Let me work on this story. Give me a chance here. It's me. So, how's Arwin? No worms or fleas or since she's been living with me. Well, maybe a vulture picked them off. Sheriff, sheriff, sheriff. Come on, guys, I can't. Not today, please. Come on. Give us any information at all, please. Blood suckers. Sheriff, come on. Something. Hey, Elliot. How you doing? Not today, Mrs. Fowler. Well actually it's Miss Perlman now. Well, you'll always be Mrs. Fowler to me. And it's deputy now. That's nice. How's Adrianne? We broke up... 2005. Oh. So, where's the suspect? That's none of your concern. Really? 'Cause I'm about to post her bail. All right, people, we're gonna have to split up the recovery search a few more miles. Hyde keeps finding pieces. Which way? They keep popping up everywhere. Right. Where the hell are the paramedics? Always the last one on the scene, you know that. Speak of the devils, huh? You Hamilton? Yeah, that's me. Jim Duffy. You in charge? but, uh, Sheriff Fowler from Jefferson Parish He's a little tied up with the press. Fucking maggots? You're telling me. So what are we talking about here? Three bodies, six? Shit, try 20 or 30. What the fuck happened? Well, it's all under investigation but, uh, we do have a girl in custody. A girl? You guys think a girl did this? Shit yeah. We got good reason too. You guys don't tell us how to do our job; we won't tell you how you suck at yours. let's start gathering the bodies over here. Bob, Randy, bag and tag. Andrew, come with me. What happened? Some people died and made a mess. Barney Fife back there, he says they got a girl in custody. - A girl? - Yeah. We're not gonna be out here all night, are we? How the fuck do I know, Andrew. What? Are you scared or something? You know where we are, right? Be a man. Have a Twinkie. What girl did that? Humph. You're awake. I'm Amanda Perlman. I- I tried to post your bail but you have to go before a judge for that and there's no bail set, so... I'm sort of the local expert on the Victor Crowley legend. Had a big splashy article not long ago, local legends and lore& The Bayou Butcher. Yeah, I saw you on "Montel". Oh, you saw that. Yeah, well, you know, not my best career move. Been trawling county websites ever since but you know- I just-I had a belief and I have a passion and it's kinda made me a national journalism joke. And one minute you're on national TV, What the fuck do you want from me? Well, I don't wanna waste your time. I can see you're busy. I just wanted to, you know, interview you about what happened, find out what you saw. Listen, I can help you. that the ghost of Victor Crowley actually exists, that would help me a lot. So you want me to help you, right? - Right? - Yeah, that's right. I mean, right now you're looking at a lifetime in jail. I might be the best chance and the best friend you've got. No offense, but fuck you. I wanna fucking lawyer, not blogger. I gave you your two minutes. Now, you just listen to me. We're gonna run through this again, Marybeth Dunston, daughter of Samson Dunston, washed up local drunk, who if he's even got enough education to sign off on your death penalty acceptance would have to be poured out of a local bar to do it. And let's not forget your brother Ainsley. How many dozen DUl he got? Oh, and those three months community service for defacing a church? Look, I know you didn't do this but you're gonna go down for it 'cause you're po' white trash. You know what they do with po' white trash who are convicted on a capital charge? The state of Louisiana will execute you. So you go ahead and you sit in here. You can bark at me like a big dog in a cage, you can either help me prove Victor Crowley exists or you can wait for the lethal injection that's gonna end your miserable life. Do it. your pappy ain't been here to see you. Must be happy hour somewhere. Maybe he'll show up after he's panhandled enough pocket change for a Pabst. My father is dead. Victor Crowley killed him. Please, tell me what happened. I know I can help you. Fine. I'll wait. Son-of-a-bitch, where the hell are the other guys? Oh, shit. Where the fuck did this rain come from? Randy. - One, two, three. - Holy shit. What'd you guys bring me a giant? Yeah, it's, uh, hard to tell. This poor bastard was lying on top of the biggest chainsaw I've ever seen in my life. and his body is in a lot of different pieces. Jesus. I thought you might wanna take a look at this one The guy looks like he had all kinds of muscular and skin deformities& and he was only wearing overalls. Get the fuck out. I know, right? Anyway, looks like this one in particular might be, I don't know, crucial component in all of this. Wait a minute. You don't think, uh& I'm not saying shit, all right? All I'm saying is that you might wanna drop whatever you're doing and check this one over first. Awesome. Gonna be fucking creepy but awesome. Let's go. Come on, big man, we got a date. Oh, oh. Okay, here we go. One, two, three. Dude, I'm telling you this may be- I have seen some crazy shit, man. I was working on an Asian male, head severed off, uh, leg cut off below the knee. I'm telling you, man. Look kind of like you, man. Oh, what, because I'm Asian? No, dude, because you were- Oh, yeah, I-I get it. We all look the same, right? Ha-ha-ha. It's hilarious. Asshole. Oh, fuck that. He was shredded to pieces. There was nothing left to possibly get back up again. I mean, taking his head off wasn't enough, dismembering him was. I got away. Now what time was this? This morning. I don't know. Reverend Zombie thought that by letting Crowley kill the three people that were responsible for his death somehow the curse will be lifted and I don't know he would just go away. It was all bullshit. when I interviewed a voodoo priestess, and she was a real voodoo priestess- Oh, she was real voodoo priestess, of course. I know it sounds crazy but if anything should be a believer, I would imagine that would be you. According to legend, Victor Crowley is cursed as a repeater. Each night he has to return exactly as he was when he died. He has to relive the night of his death in an endless cycle over and over again. You can't kill him. He's already dead. It's kinda sad really. I sawed his body into little pieces. I'm pretty sure he's dead. keep him from returning again and again in his original form. He's dead. He's not. Any sign of the sheriff yet? Nothing yet. All right, well, he should be here soon, all right? I'm on channel six when you see him. Hey. Any more bodies? Oh, man. It's hard to tell. It looks like we got a whole area down there by the cabin, the whole crime scene over there a whole mess of bodies even more in the east. My call, I think the victims were in two separate groups. Hell, they probably didn't even see each other down there. Coming each way in different directions. Oh, man, how the hell do you deal with that smell? It takes a couple of years but you do get used it. Another day on the job for me. You know, close the door, man. I'll be on six. Randy? Freeze! Don't move! Shit! What? Hamilton? Get off of me, right now, dammit! Somebody help! Holy shit! Holy shit. Help. Help! Hamilton! Hamilton, do-do you read? Sheriff? Lou, are you there? I heard it. I'm making a call to the state. Bring everyone and everything I can bring with me. We should be out there in less than 30. You still think he's dead? I killed him! You didn't but I know how. How? His father endlessly night after night. he can finally find peace and pass on- Thomas Crowley has been dead for years. but first I need to know that you're gonna help me out. I already told you everything that I know. You are the only living relative of Samson Dunston, the man who caused all of this. You are the only one who can end it. That means you are the only one who can make it stop. You heard what I heard on the radio! How many more people have to die before this is over? I can't. You can. We're going for a ride. Oh, hell, no. we have a report of a man down at Honey Island Swamp. No response from fire, paramedics on site. I need all available units to Honey Island. All available units to the swamp. Elliot, you have to help me because if you don't, everybody in that swamp is gonna die. You open that door. Look out, look out! Open it! Oh! All right, cover-cover me! Now! All right, here's what we know now. A group of Jefferson Parish PD, paramedic and fire respond to a report of a multiple homicide There are 12 people all of whom are now MIA. We have one suspect in custody and our last contact was about 45-45 minutes ago but we did receive distress calls of an unknown attacker and multiple men down. So, who's left? We're not exactly sure. Do we know if the attacker is still in the area? Well, we have to assume so, yeah. But, uh, guys, I want you all armed and at the ready. We got no idea what we're dealing with here so let's be prepared for anything, okay? Is the attacker armed? Definitely, but we just don't know with what. I'll take it from here, Sheriff. Officer Hawes, Louisiana State SWAT. Uh, nice to meet you, sir, but actually these are my men and, uh-sir& All right, everybody, listen up. You will give one verbal warning and then you will shoot to kill. Do I make myself clear? - Yes, sir. - Good. Let's stay together and move out. Son of a bitch! What have you got in there nuclear warhead? but I brought about every other toy I could get my hands on. You don't fuck around. Mikaela Dougherty. Cory Schneiderman. It's a pleasure. You're planning on taking out a T-Rex tonight? You do know where we are, right? Smelly swamp? This is his swamp. Victor Crowley. I'm sorry. I'm new here. I just transferred from Arizona. Who's Victor Crowley? there's this little boy who was born deformed and he- Come on, let's go, dipshit. That guy's such a fucking asshole! I'll tell you about it later. The NRA would be proud. I'm a member. Can you please take these cuffs off of me? Absolutely not. I shouldn't be doing this. I'll lose my job on this. locked up in the back of this fucking car? Will you please shut up? How far is Ozona? Ozona? It's up there, uh, 11 freeway on the other side of Nicholson. What-what? What's in Ozona? Ozona is nowhere near Honey Island Swamp. We need to get to Ozona is what we need to do. And for the last time, it's Miss Perlman, Elliot, okay? Just, you know, call me Amanda. Do that. Amanda. I thought you were Sheriff Fowler's wife. I need to call Sheriff and let him know what we're doing. No, you absolutely do not. Not yet. Do you understand how much trouble my ass is gonna be in? I'll tell you what, get me to Ozona and then you can call Louis and tell him we're on our way. Deal? What is in Ozona? Thomas Crowley. Thomas Crowley? Thomas Crow- if he were alive, wouldn't he be like, 300 fucking years old by now? He's dead. So what are we gonna do dig him up? Not exactly. Tell me about the suspect. Well, she turned herself in this morning. She was covered in someone else's blood holding a shotgun. Did she give a confession? She kept carrying on about some local legend named Victor Crowley. Hmm. Yeah, I'm familiar. when your men made a distress call, correct? But my guess is it's one of these Crowley impersonators, who's heard the ghost story one time too many. But she's clearly part of it though. Yeah, well, I'll be the judge of that. I suppose if anybody's a Crowley expert that would be you, right? I mean your wife is Amanda Fowler, correct? Ah, ex. She's my ex-wife. I've got a few of those myself. Yeah, it's complicated. I thought she and I, we just clicked so good, you know. But then I don't know- I was just making small talk, Sheriff. I really don't wanna hear about your divorce. No offense. So, uh, when did you transfer? About a month ago. So far so good, though, Mardi Gras has been a trip. Fucking Mardi Gras. It's the worst time of the year for all of us. Everyone flocks to Bourbon Street thinking it's gonna be like one of those Bayou beaver DVDs and instead they get two for 60-year-old women flashing their sagging pancake- Just a bird. You're really freaked out, huh? Yes, I'm really freaked out. There's a reason this swamp is condemned and closed off to the public. Enough people disappear, enough bodies pile up and eventually you can't help but believe there's some truth to the ghost stories you hear around here. and I'm already a believer. I'll tell you that much. Hey, I get it. I believe in ghost too. I swear I saw one in my bedroom when I was six years old but it just smiled at me and walked out. It wasn't scary, kinda peaceful and comforting. This isn't Casper the Friendly Ghost. 'Cause Casper doesn't tear you in half with his bare hands. Fucking Christ. Do you still believe in friendly ghost? What the hell did this? What's that? God, we're fucked. We're fucked. Someone shut Schneiderman the hell up. It's a good thing you got that girl in custody, huh, Sheriff? I'm trying to reach the person we're going to see. See if he's home. Who are we going to see? His name is Abbott McMullen. Um, I did a bunch of interviews with him a couple of years back. My original Crowley piece. Okay. What are you doing? Why are you stopping, Elliot? Ol' man McMullen? Abbott McCrazy. Yeah, your point is? We are in some serious shit here, Amanda. We have friends in that swamp that are seriously injured, if not dead. And I just took our prime suspect out of jail against the law. And against my better judgment. And now you have me out here on some wild goose chase chasing I don't know what with a more morbid version of Wednesday Addams who could possibly be a psycho killer. Yeah, I'm sitting right here. No offense. None taken. Asshole. Hey, I'm still an officer of the law so watch your mouth before I add a few more charges to your list. Oh, can me telling you to go fist your own ass be another one of them charges? Okay, see, that's it. Okay. No, no, no. Abbott McMullen is the only living relative of Thomas Crowley. Thomas Crowley is his great uncle. He has Thomas Crowley on his mantle in an urn. The only way to give the ghost of Victor Crowley peace is to finally give him what he wants. If that's true, then why didn't you just bring him Thomas Crowley's ashes years ago? Only the person responsible for his death can finally deliver what it is he's looking for. I tried to have this conversation and he pulled a gun on me and told me to go fuck myself. Classy family. Go fuck yourself. Look, I know how insane this sounds, but until somebody has a better idea, this is the only option we got. So I suggest we stop the fighting, and we try to put an end to this once and for all. Louis is out in that swamp, your best friend, my husband. You mean your ex-husband, right? Just drive. Please. I hate to break it to you again, lady, but my father is dead. He sure is, but you're not. No way one person did all of this. Can you stop dancing around what's really going on here? Shut up, Schneiderman. With all due respect, whether you wanna believe it or not, this is Victor Crowley written all fucking over. Control your deputy, Sergeant. Schneiderman, stand down. Are you kidding me? These are somebody's balls. Balls are not supposed to be hanging from trees yet I'm finding myself looking at fucking balls, sir. That guy knows what's up. We need to get the fuck out of here and call the national fucking guard or some shit - before we all end up& - Shut your fucking mouth. This whole thing could be some sort of a joke. A sick, perverse practical fucking joke. That doesn't look like a joke to me. My deputy is right. I'm calling in the military and we're leaving. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Hold your fire. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire. Who the hell are you? I'm Andrew. I'm what's left of the first response team, sir. Look, we got to get the fuck outta here right now. Thank God, you guys showed up. Why don't you tell me what happened then? W- What happened? Fucking Victor Crowley happened that's what. Look around! Then why are you still here? I hid underneath someone else's body I found over there. All right? He massacred everyone in minutes! And you didn't fight back? No, I didn't fight back! And that's the only reason those aren't my balls hanging from that tree! Okay, please! Please, we need to leave right this second. This is Sheriff Fowler, Jefferson Parish. I'm trying to reach Colonel Mesco, Louisiana National Guard. Repeat that, Sheriff Fowler? We got a sit- Cancel that request. Copy that. This is SWAT Leader Tyler Hawes. The situation's under control. Cancel that request. What's your 20, Officer Hawes? Do not answer that. All right, everyone, listen up. I will not, and I repeat, not be losing my job by calling the fuckin' military until I figure out what exactly is fuckin' going on here. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. I- Is this guy kidding? Fuck this shit! Your ego is putting all of us in danger. Fuckin' fire me. I don't care. I'm leaving. Officer Schneiderman, are you aware of the consequences for fleeing the scene of a murder? Yup, but at least I'll be alive. Don't do it, deputy. Calm down! What are you? Are you scared? Yes! Yes, I'm fuckin' scared! How the fuck are you not scared?! He's like a tank. No matter how many bullets he took, he just kept getting back up and coming. If we don't leave right this second, nobody's gonna be alive tomorrow. Where is he? I don't know! I've been playing dead a- and hiding until you guys showed up! Last I heard w-was screaming coming from & over there. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your- Go check it out. We got him. Good job, fucktards. Oh, my god! Hide! Hide, hide, hide! Move. Move, move. Go! Guys, guys, guys, check this out. Who wants in on this? No. No, no. Hey, lights down. Stop. This is not a good place t-to hide. Um, I-I think he lives here so- Bushes over here. Hey, you? You wanna hide in the bush? I'm so gonna fuckin' die. I'm so gonna fuckin' die. Shut your fuckin' mouth! Stop, guys! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Louis, Louis, Louis. Stop, stop! Stop the fire! Stop! Help me! Louis! Louis! No. No. Help. Help me! No. Move your head! Help me! Can you- Oh no! Move back! Move back, move back, move back! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Fire! Help me! Help! What the-what the fuck! Get down! No! Let's do this, you little bitch. Oh! Whoa. Oh, fuck this! Schneiderman! Hey! - You're gonna kill him! - He's already dead! The guy was a real fuckin' dick anyways. Running around in your fuckin' overalls killing everybody I fuckin' know. Oh, my god, please! Please, God! Please stop! I'll give you your fuckin' daddy, you deformed douche. Sorry, Rick. Eat this, motherfucker! Woo! Yeah! Woo! Now that's how you take a bitch out! Run! Come on, back to the boat! Come on! Get up! Oh, dammit! Oh my god! Fuck you! Fuck you! This is it? I spent two days interviewing Abbott McMullen for my Crowley story. You never quite get the smell out of your sinuses. And you think he's just gonna hand over the ashes of Thomas Crowley to you? No, but he'll hand them over to you. Wait&what? Stay here. Where the fuck am I gonna go? Amanda, this is crazy! You can't do this! you can personally haul my little ass to jail. 'Cause this is the last chance we've got to bring this to an end. How? That girl is Samson Dunston's bloodline. Hi, Mr. McMullen. Remember me? Who are you? I'm Amanda Fowler. From the paper? Yes, sir. I ought to shoot you dead for waking me up at this crazy hour. It's the middle of the night for Chrissakes! It's 8:45. Well, that's what I said! Who is the colored? Who's the- Deputy Winslow, Jefferson Parish. And you do know that the whole Civil Rights thing did take place, just FYI. I didn't do nothing to that little girl. There ain't no crime in looking. I'm sure you didn't. Not a nice tolerant man such as yourself. This here is harassment. I'll have your job. After tonight, yeah, you just might have my job. Mr. McMullen, we just wanted to visit with you about a matter of extreme urgency. What? Was there a fire? She's fine, she's fine. Um, we just wanted to have a minute of your time, just a minute. Well, all I got's a minute. Got a lot of irons in the fire, you know? Oh, yes, I know. I know that. Thank you. Thank you very much. And don't you try to steal nothing. I got eyes in the front of my head. Why don't you just offer me some fried chicken and watermelon while you're at it? I ain't got no food. It was a joke. You mumble. I can't understand you people. You-forget it. What? Forget it! Faggot?! I ain't no faggot. Well, come on in. If you're here to talk about Victor Crowley again, I told you everything I had to say yesterday. Well, actually, Abbot, that was 10 years ago. What? Speak up! I- I'm not here to talk about Victor Crowley. Well, then what the hell do you want? We are here on official police business. You've got a piece of evidence that is part of our investigation. We wanted to borrow it and then bring it right back to ya. And where is your warrant? You're not under arrest. It's okay. You're not in any kind of trouble, Mr. McMullen. We just want to borrow an item from you and return it to you briefly. You know you mumble too much. I can't even understand you. Oh, you know, um, when last we spoke you told me that these are Thomas Crowley's ashes. Isn't that right? No. Them's my uncle's ashes. That's right. These are your uncle's ashes. What the hell you doing, you little harlot? I am just gonna borrow these for a little bit. We're gonna bring him right back. Oh, oh, over my dead body! Mr. Mullin, I'm afraid I must insist. I'll bring your uncle's ashes back to you personally. What the hell do you want with my uncle's ashes anyway? I'm taking these as evidence. This is part of a police investigation. - Show him my badge? - Show your badge. It's official police business, sir. That's right. Who did you rob this from? Who did I- You know, that's it. I'm through. I'm done. Abbott, I promise we'll be bringing him back. We'll be bringing him right back. I said over my dead body. Well, then you leave me no choice. Go ahead, shoot me. Go on, do it! Shoot a defenseless old man. Go on, pull the trigger. Abbott, I'm sorry but we are leaving now with this urn. Open the door! Do it, shoot me! Go on, do it. Yeah, I knew you's a coward. You come barging into my house with some negro thief claiming to be a cop. Fuck you! Fuck you! I am a veteran. I went all the way to Korea. Fuckin' white people! That's right, run, boy! Pow! Yeah, I gotcha. Let's get the hell outta here! Is it-is it still following us? Come on. Okay, he knocked the wind out of me. What are you doing? No stopping! Stopping, stopping is very bad! Who the hell was that? Well, he was a paramedic. Doesn't he work with you? Yeah, but I-I don't know his name. Hey? We gotta get back to the boat. You're going the wrong way. See? Fuck that guy! Well, I- You gotta be fuckin' kidding me. You're Samson's bloodline. You have to be the one to give the ghost what it wants. The fuck I do. You can't bring me back there! We don't have a choice. The one who caused the ghost death is the only one who can make it right. I had nothing to do with this. But your father did. this is the only way to make it right. Why are you just coming up with this plan tonight? I told you I approached your father years ago. It didn't exactly go over well. And until you waltzed into the police station wearing Victor Crowley's innards, what proof did I have that he was real? - No! - Stop! - You're gonna get us killed! - No! Stop it, Marybeth! - Stop! - You can't take me back! Turn the fuckin' car around. You can't- You have to go, Marybeth! - No! - Only you! Only you! You're the one! Oh, gee. Oh. Oh, God. Come on, man, let's go! What's wrong with this one? I don't have the keys. What? Why? I work with a bunch of redneck racist. They won't let me drive anything. Christ almighty, let's go! Fuck it. Back in the ambulance. Move it! Shit! This is Sheriff Fowler of Jefferson Parish. - This is Sheriff Fowler& - Fuck! This is Sheriff Louis Fowler- Goddamn it's dead! Does that work? - Yeah. - Thank God. This is Sheriff Fowler, Jefferson Parish PD. S- O-S, I repeat, S-O-S. We are under attack in Honey Island Swamp. This is the National Guard's frequency, Sheriff Fowler. Did you say you are under attack? We need help immediately, okay? Listen, you gotta send military assistance or something as soon as possible, okay? We're-we're pinned down here. We got SWAT team officers dead, we've got fuckin' half of Louisiana police department is dead. Who's attacking you, sheriff? Victor Crowley. Repeat that? Crazed gunmen. and-and they're firing everything they've got. We need military assistance. You gotta send some kind of chopper or something, airlift us the fuck out of here! Understood, sheriff. We are dispatching air support immediately. What are your coordinates? I ain't got no fuckin' coordinates, you moron! I'm in Honey Island fuckin' Swamp! There's a six major league fuckin' police boats that will be parked alongside the shore. That's where we'll be, okay? Pinned down in an ambulance taking heavy fire! We are on our way. Hold tight. Finally. Fuckin' finally somethin' goes right. Wait. Be quiet. What? He's gone. Nobody move. Maybe he gave up. Even if he did, nobody steps outside this fuckin' boat. Nobody touches anything without my say so. Do you understand me? Sounds good. We're staying put till the National Guard gets here. Randy. That guy's name was Randy. I knew his name. What is that? Shut up and listen. Oh! Where the fuck he get a grinder? Oh, shit! It's a gas belt sander. It was in the evidence pile outside the boat with those other weapons. Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, I put it there. My bad. Oh, shit! We really need to call the sheriff and let him know& Elliot, Elliot, no. he will order you to take me and Marybeth back. - Yeah, probably. - And then what? - I'll say I pulled your gun. - Yeah, right. I'll do whatever it takes, Elliot, because I am not wrong. I am not. I'm sorry. Oh, don't do it, Elliot. Please don't do this. Sheriff, you there? Lou, come back. Louis? This is Deputy Winslow. Heather, you there? Where the hell have you been all night? Shit is going down out on Honey Island. Yeah, I'm aware. I'm boarding the boat now. Do you have that Dunston girl with you? Please, tell me that isn't true. Look, I can explain everything. Just-when's the last time you talked to the sheriff? It's been almost two hours since we've heard from anyone out there. But the National Guard received a distress call from a paramedic boat and they're on their way in. What the hell is happening out there? Look, who-who placed the distress call? Why did you take the suspect out of her cell? Who sent out the distress call? They said it was the sheriff. He said there's a group of gunmen attacking them or something. We can't get a response from anyone here. Don't you see Louis is alive? Yeah, two hours ago! He called in the military. He said it was a group of gunmen. Don't you get it? He did that so that he would be sure that they would come. What's he gonna say? Victor Crowley's attacking us? You gotta think about this. We have got to get out there and we gotta get out there now! And then what? And then we make sure she puts that monster back in his grave where he belongs. Oh, shit! Should we run for it? Where? Back to the woods? No, to his boat. While this fucker is distracted sawing through this wall, let's open the door and run for the other boat. Even if you get a head start, there's no way the three of us will make it. It's like he's everywhere at once. What are you doing? I don't know. I don't know. We have to find something to fight back with. The RPG didn't take him. Do you think a couple of needles will? Well, we have to do something. We're running out of time here. What's the ETA on that chopper? Chopper's coming in from Baton Rouge. ETA 10 minutes. We ain't got 10! Dammit! He must have chewed through the wiring! Hey, I see the other boats. Let's-let's pull around. We don't have time. We're close enough. You heard her, let's go. Let's go. Now, listen, you gotta trust me. Look, I promise I won't let anything happen to you. You know that promise? It's fading fast. Come on, get it together. Get your hands off me! This will be over soon. Yeah, it will be. Stop it! Stop it! Get it off! Get it off! Sheriff? Louis? Lou! Now what? - Sheriff? - Louis, answer me! - They're all dead. - He's not dead! - He is so dead! - No, he isn't. He called for help. He's not dead. - Here! - No! Take it. Take it! Get out of my face, bitch! Take it! Sheriff! Victor? Victor, come out. Come and get your daddy. Victor Crowley, Victor Crowley, we've got your daddy. Why did he stop? - Louis? - Shh! I'm trying to listen. Sheriff Fowler? I think it's them. Oh, thank God. Luis, where the hell are you? Amanda? Who's Amanda? Oh god, it's my wife. Okay. Amanda? Victor! You come out here to me right now. I got something you've been needing a long time. Sheriff Fowler! Don't even. I still have ammo. Fowler! - Just stay- - Put. - Sheriff! - I can reach it. Stay away from that hole. Shh! Victor, where are you? Shh. Okay. Don't. Don't do it. Don't do it. I wanna see you! Okay. Don't. Stop. You come out now! Stop. I got your daddy here, Victor! Come out! Come and get your daddy! This is bullshit. Amanda, we need to find the others. We found them. There you go. Look around. Victor, come on, where are you? He's-He's here. Freeze! Oh god. On the floor now! Don't let anything happen to her. - No. - Only you. We can't kill him unless you put it into his hand. Go! You hear me? You do it. You do it. Do it! Here. Don't shoot until he has it. Here he is. I'm s-I'm sorry for what they did to you and I'm-I'm sorry. And I'm sorry for what my father did to you. I'm sorry. Daddy. Take it. Take it. - Ah! - Step back, Marybeth. I said step back! Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. He's dead. No, Elliot, no! Elliot, no! Give him the ashes! I knew you were real. I came to save you. Here's daddy, you motherfucker! Got to get up. Get up. Get up. Fuckin' do it already! Just one more time. Come on, do it. Come on, do it. Come on, do it. Come on, do it. Come on, fuckin' do it already! Come on, get up! Oh, goddammit, do it already. Fuckin' do it already! Fuck it! Hey! Hey! Over here! I'm here! I'm-get me the fuck outta here! Help! Help!
