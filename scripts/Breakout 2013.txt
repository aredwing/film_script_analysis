And that I did it because you awakened me. The words and thoughts of my beautiful little girl moved me. Come on, Daddy. Did it let my cause become so important that it took me away from my family? It did, and for that I'll always be sorry. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] But I never stopped loving you. Not for one second. I paid a price for doing what I believed was right. And I know you and Mikey and your mom are suffering too. You've grown into a beautiful young woman, Jen. [LAUGHS] I wanna make it better between us. I wanna be the father I haven't been. [SHUTTER CLICKS] JEN: Are we there yet? JACK: Yes, we are. What happened, Daddy? I don't know. JEN: You have to protect the trees, Daddy. JACK: Come on. [CHAINSAWS WHIRRING] MAN: All right, clear the area. JACK: Remember, we're not here to fight. If you feel threatened, take the ground, curl up, and cover your head. Had the roads all blocked there, Jack. So how'd you and your merry pranksters get in, huh? We walked. You look good in a suit. You used to dress like them. This is private property. No, this is a conservation. This is all replant. That's very astute of you... You cannot cut this down. We own this land. Understand? JACK: Fan out. CHUCK: Okay, fan out. So you go back to whatever mode of transport you were on. Get your asses out of here. Otherwise you are gonna be arrested. What? Jack-Come on. What's the matter, Jack? Got nothing better to do with your time? Here's what I suggest. Help! Take you and your granola friends out of here. WOMAN: Help! Somebody! Help! Get away! Aah! WOMAN: Leave me alone! Get your hands off her. [BOTH GRUNTING] [WOMAN YELLING] Get up! OFFICER: Hey, that's enough. That's enough. [THUNDER RUMBLING THEN CRASHES] [DOOR BUZZES] [DOOR BUZZES] GUARD: You get to join the work detail this week, Jack. Someone made a hell of a mess last night, blocked a couple of roads and totaled a car. Crew is already out there, you'll be joining them. JACK: Maria, can we push that CBB interview back to Friday? I'll have to call them. JACK: Well, call them. [PHONE RINGS] You got Jack. WOMAN: The deal went through. Conpine got it? Yeah, they got all of it and you didn't hear it from me. Conpine just took the whole frigging reservation. MARIA: No referendum, midnight conveyance? JACK: Can't do that. It's a protest tonight. Conpine is no lightweight. You know what happened in Seattle. What's that got to do with me? MARIA: What I'm saying is I don't want you to go in there. JACK: I'm not just gonna sit here and let this go down. I'm sorry, but I don't compromise. You're putting your interests ahead of your family. No, I am not. Yes, you are. You think those children wanna see their father in jail? No one's going to jail. Jack, I know Conpine far better than you do, okay? This smells like a setup. Do not go in there. Thank you, counselor. [CHAINSAWS AND MACHINE WHIRRING] JACK: I'm not gonna sit here and just let this go down. MARIA: You think those kids wanna see their father in jail? I'm warning you. Don't go in there, Jack. KENNY: Were they nice to you in jail? Miss Lambrada was nice to me. Does she know I'm gone? I'm not supposed to go anywhere. Did you tell her you were taking me? I sure did. That's good, Tommy, I sure hope they were nice to you. Wanna know where we're headed? Someplace they can't bother you no more. Canada. That's nice, Canada. Canada, that's nice. Yes, it is. Sault Ste. Marie. How long is it gonna take to get there, Tommy? Couple days. We ain't driving nights. I don't like driving at nights, Tommy. I know. WOMAN: Conpine needs to get this done now with Jack. MARIA [OVER PHONE]: Right. Bad press is dogging them. But let's use it to our advantage. When are you planning to see him? MARIA: Now. Just get him to accept the deal. Well, I'll tell him you said so. Let's get him out of jail. Is it true what we're hearing? We don't know anything yet. Is Jack gonna cut a deal with Conpine? I'll get back to you. You look nice. Two major points of the deal. First, no more slamming them in public. Second, and this is a kicker, they want you to consult for them. They want me to work for them? No, consult. What's the difference? They've turned over a new leaf, ecologically speaking. Why would they do that? What does Conpine get out of this? They're in talks with the government to take over a vast tract of land in northern BC. People are making noises. They need to be better corporate citizens. That'd be a complete sellout. No... Yes, it would. No, it wouldn't. They'd probably get it anyway. Here are the things we can do. Take advantage of the situation. We can set up programs, corporate responsibility, reforestation, school education, environmental safeguards. Did you say "we"? I can get you out of here in two weeks. That's three years early, I'd say that's a good deal, Jack. So I just take the deal and then they make all the charges go away? As your attorney, I think you should take the deal. What was it? Was it '85? President Botha said to Mandela: "You wanna get out of jail, then you just have to say: 'I tried to overthrow the government, I was bad, I shouldn't have."' And then he gets to walk away. He made him an offer. Mandela turned him down, did 14 more years. What do you want? You wanna be a martyr? You wanna...? Is that it? You wanna stay in here, be deified? It's not like I had a choice. Yes, you did, but you didn't listen. Do you have any idea who's paying the price for this? Our kids. Jack, we have a daughter who has serious issues and she needs help. She needs both of us. She needs you. Look, we may be separated, but you're still their father. And those kids want you out of here. So do I. [SIGHS] If I take the deal with Conpine, are you willing to give us another try? KENNY: You ever talk to Mom? Mom? I sure do miss her. She's long dead, Kenny. Do you miss her? Hell, no. I do. What do you miss about her? She was our mom. You miss the beatings with the poker? Listening to her turn tricks in the bed beside us? You miss that? She cooked good. And she was nice when she was nice. She was never nice. She was bad. I just miss her. [LINE RINGING] JEN: Hi, you've reached Jenny. Sorry, I'm not here but leave a message. I'll get back to you. [KENNY CHUCKLING] Come on, it's time to go. Tommy, can I have this comic? It's really funny, Tommy. You want the comic book? You got it. Yeah. Thanks. Tommy said I could have this comic. Uh, gas, chips, comic books, 37.52. Hey, what's the matter with him? He some sort of retard or something? Keep the change. Hey, you forgot your chips, sir. Asshole. Fuck it. CLIVE: Hey! What the hell you doing? Get off me. [GRUNTING] God, stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You ain't sorry, you're scared. You have every right to be. God shaped all of us the way we are. All of us. You bastard. You fuck with my brother, I'll fuck with you. You wanna look at that picture? Come on now, I know you do. It's here somewhere. Here it is. Here. Come on, have a look. Come on, Kenny, grab it. Come on, now. Grab it. Damn. We're really gonna live here? Yes, sir. Sent the check last week. When I get there, I'm gonna get myself a job. Mechanic or something. Look after you the way I did before the accident. Mm. Yes, sir. Man, I used to love riding behind you on that motorcycle. Should've never let you drive that night. Wasn't my fault, Tommy. It was the truck's fault. That's gotta be it. Road to Canada. Canada? Cellie told me about it. KENNY: Yeah, Tommy, I'm starting to get scared, so... TOMMY: It's okay, just relax. Tommy, this doesn't seem right. Can we go back to the border crossing...? It's okay. It's fine. No, it's not okay. It's not okay at all. Hush, Kenny, and I mean right now. Doesn't look right, Tommy. It's okay. Just relax. Tommy, we're right back where we started. What are you talking about? No, we're not. You see that license plate back there, what did it say? What did it say? Ontario. Ontario, Canada. We here, boy. We're in Canada. They're nice here. Nicer than where we came from. So, guys, your dad is taking the deal with Conpine, and he'll be home in two weeks. Home? Your dad and I are gonna give it another try. What? Why? CHUCK: Hey, guys, you all set? MIKEY: So are we still going camping up to Finger Point? Are you packed up? Just gotta get my gear in the truck. Jen, you packed? What? No, I'm going out with friends tonight. You're not going outwith friends. You can try this tough thing if you really want to, but you can't stop me. MARIA: You are not going out tonight. Jen, I could really use an assistant up there. [WHISPERS] Pays really good money. Yeah, assisting what? [IN NORMAL VOICE] Taking soil samples. What are you paying? A hundred bucks for the weekend. Okay, 200. Anything's better than being stuck here with her. I'll go pack. I think this is it. Where are we? We're here? We're here. Wow. Wow, Tommy. Tommy, this is beautiful. Yeah, it is. This is it, little brother. This is it, all right. KENNY: Is someone gonna meet us here? They're supposed to. He said he left the key under the mat. No goddamn key. Maybe the man will bring it. TOMMY: Said he left it under the mat. I ain't waiting. Welcome home, little brother. Thanks, Tommy. This is great. Yeah, it is. [CHUCK SINGING OPERA] MIKEY: Really? JEN: Chuck, of all the things you have to sing... CHUCK: What, you don't like good music? Ha-ha-ha. When was the last time you went fishing? Along, long time, Tommy. Well, you wanna go and get some dinner? Can I? Yes, you can. Come on. We're gonna get some fish. This is gonna be great, Tommy. I just know it. CHUCK: Yeah, there are bears and snakes and spiders, all kinds of life-threatening creatures, don't worry. [MIKEY SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] JEN: Wow, we're really in the middle of nowhere. Cool. Let's go kayaking. [CHUCKLES] [RINGTONE PLAYING ON PHONE] Hello. Jen, how are you, sweetheart? It's me, it's Daddy. Hey, Dad. Hi, how you doing? Just great. Good. Uh, glad to hear that. Hey, listen, have you heard the news? Yeah. Yeah, you're out in two weeks. That's pretty good. That's right. Yeah, home in two weeks. Two weeks. Mm-hm. Um... I need you to come up and see me. It's important, I gotta talk to you. I'm at goddamn Finger Point with Mikey and Chuck. Come on, don't talk like that. Please. Right. Do you wanna talk to Chuck? No, I wanna talk to you. Here's Chuck. No, Jen. CHUCK: Congratulations, you get out in two weeks? Yeah, that's what my lawyer says. Well, you have a good lawyer. Yeah. What's going on with Jen? Hey, you know what? She's 17. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Um, hey, listen, Chuck, there's something that I... Thanks a lot for everything you're doing. I really appreciate it. It means the world to me. I don't know how to say it any other way. You don't have to thank me. Listen, it's beautiful out here, we're gonna have a great time. Bye. Uh, Chuck, I have to use the bathroom. Seriously? Mm-hm. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Hilarious. Really funny. [BOTH LAUGH] Your dad told me you're the reason he became an environmentalist. When I was a little kid, I asked him if he could protect the forest. Evidently, he took you pretty seriously. Yes. Maybe a bit too seriously. He loves his cause. He loves you too, Jen. Yeah, I guess. JACK: I understand the issues you have with me, Jen. I do. I wanna come home. I wanna be with you. I wanna be with Mikey, I wanna be with my family. I disappointed you in the past. I promise you, I will not disappoint you in the future. I love you. Daddy. You must be Mr. Pain. Pleasure to meet you, sir. I'm Tommy Baxter. I'm supposed to know you or something? I sent you the check for the cottage for the summer. What was your last name again? Baxter. Tommy Baxter. Baxter. Check bounced. I rented it to someone else, they're coming in next week. So you guys gotta get the hell out of here. You what? I rented it to someone else. Sir, you can't do that. My brother and me, we really like this house. I'll pay you, I'll pay you right now. Get the hell out. Sir, I'll pay you. I'll pay you... I don't want your money. Now get the hell out. Come on, we gotta go. [BOTH GRUNTING] MIKEY: Hey. Can Jen go kayaking now, Chuck? Yeah, put in a good day's work. I'm impressed. Go take Mikey kayaking. Are you sure? Yup, have fun. Stay away from the other side of the river, the current gets strong there. Yeah. Good work. Come on. JEN: I'll race you. Be careful. MIKEY: You're gonna regret that. [PANTING] [GROANS] Come on, Jen. JEN: I'm coming. [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [CHUCKLES] What the hell is wrong with you? Why are you such an asshole? That's our home. That's our home now. PAIN: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You can't take a man's home. Please. Please don't. You a man of faith? Yes. Yes. Well, make your peace. No. No, no. Dear God, please help me. No. Forgive me. KENNY: Tommy. Tommy, don't. Please, Tommy, don't. Stay out of this. Please. [PAIN SOBBING] Jesus Christ. What was that? We gotta get out of here. JEN: What happened? What happened? I think somebody shot somebody. Goddamn. Think them kids saw something? No, Tommy, they're just little kids. Jenny! Mikey! We gotta take care of this. I don't think they saw anything, Tommy. MIKEY: Come on, Jen. KENNY: What are we gonna do? Got to find out what them kids saw. Can't hurt kids, Tommy, can't. TOMMY: Wanna go back to that facility? KENNY: No. No. I did my 14 years. I hope they didn't see it, Tommy. I... JEN: Chuck! I'm coming. I'm coming. Praise God. Chuck! CHUCK: It's okay. I'm here. JEN: Chuck! Chuck, it sounded like gunshots. It sounded like that to me too. Are you okay? Are you okay? I saw someone get shot. What? Are you sure? You okay? He killed him. Oh, my God. Did they see you? Did they see you? I don't know. I think so. JEN: They saw Mikey? I gotta get you out. They saw you? I gotta get you out of here. Come on. Come on. That's the guy. If I say run, you run. Hey, campers. We heard rifle shots, you hear them? Yeah, we heard something. Could be hunters. A lot of deer up here. TOMMY: Mm. Seems like someone's hunting out of season. CHUCK: Yeah. So that rifle shot wasn't you guys? No, sir. Saw you guys from where we staying up there. Thought we'd come down, see if you're okay. Yeah, yeah. We're okay. How long you here for? Another hour. People are expecting us. Right. Mm. What about you, little man? You see something out there? Out...? Out where? You was in the kayak by the point, right? MIKEY: Yeah. Well, I saw you out there. I think you should leave. What about you, princess? We didn't see anything. Well, you have a nice day. Watch them bears. KENNY: Tommy, please. We can't hurt those kids. We don't have to hurt the kids. Please. Please, Tommy. Please. Please, please. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Run! [BOTH GRUNTING] You see them? No. Your days are numbered. The Lord, Jesus Christ, has spoken to me. You're a bad man. You a man of faith? I'm an environmentalist. Well, that's between you and him. You call them kids back and I'll make it quick on you. You understand me? Good. [GROANING] Do it. Jenny! Mikey! Can you hear me? It's me, Chuck! Tell them we're gone. Come on now. Run! Run, come on. You head up the hill. I'll head this way. Can't be that far. Come on, hurry. OK. JEN: Shh. They won't find us here. How long before you get Jack's signature? Everyone wants to put this to bed. Yeah. I'll get Jack to sign within the hour. [KEYPAD BEEPING] [LINE RINGING] All right. All right. Oh, hey, Zak, hold on a second. [KEYPAD BEEPS] Hi, Jen, everything going okay? Mama? Who's this?

You remember what you told me once? [SIGHS] What did I tell you? That you didn't mean to be bad. It's just that life didn't turn out the way you thought it would. I sure hope you're happy now. Are you? Are you happy now? You sure do sound happier now. I'm happier now, Kenny. JACK: Jenny! Mikey! Chuck! [CHUCK GRUNTING] [GASPS] Jack. Chuck. What happened? Two men, in the woods.

We gotta get all of them. Tommy, I think we should just let them go. That ain't gonna happen. Well, what are we gonna do? Box them in. You stay up here, I'll head down the river. Move up from there in the morning. In the morning? You want me to stay up here all night by myself? Start stacking it up here. I'll be right back. Okay. I can track cougar! I can track bear! And I can track you! Can't deny the Lord's will. Come on out, hero. Be a man! Your day is coming. Damn straight it is. JACK: You need to know that... I'll never let anything bad happen to you. You just need to know that. I'm really sorry I didn't visit you in jail, Dad. That doesn't matter. I was wrong. That's no place for you to be. Thanks for coming for us, Dad. There's gotta be a patrol around here somewhere. I know they're looking for me. KENNY: Tommy? [ANIMAL HOWLS IN DISTANCE] [WHIMPERING] [WHIMPERING] Please.

I'm looking for her but I can't find her. What do you mean, you're looking for her? I thought she's with you. I think I'm probably just like Tommy... I think... Kenny? I thin k...

JACK: Um... We could use a ride into town. OK. You got a phone? I need to make a call. No, sorry. Got a radio in the truck though. Great. What are you guys doing out here? We're really lucky to have found you. I was checking traps in the area. What are you trapping? I'm not trapping anything- Poachers trap the bears. Just hold on a second here. MAN [OVER RADIO]: This is dispatch, go ahead, Park Ranger... [JEN SHRIEKING] JACK: Run! Go! Go, go, go! [MIKEY SCREAMING] JEN: Mikey! Mikey! This is dispatch responding to your call. Do you copy? Over. [SOBBING THEN SCREAMING] It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna get it off. You don't have to do this. Please. Please. What the hell you doing? Can't let you hurt them, Tommy. I promised Mom. What the hell you talking about? I'm not gonna let you hurt them. Move now. Please! [GUNSHOT THEN KENNY SCREAMS] [TOMMY GASPING AND KENNY GROANING] Dad! Oh, no. [SOBBING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] Shh. It's gonna be okay. [GRUNTING] I'm sorry, Kenny. I'm sorry, Kenny. I'm sorry. MAN: How do you feel now that your husband's been pardoned? MARIA: We're very thankful about the reversal of Jack Damson's conviction. And we appreciate all of your support. Thank you.
