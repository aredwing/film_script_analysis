That's right. - Any name. - You got one? I can't... I can't make up me mind. Why don't you ask me what's in the bag? [chuckling] What's in the bag? - It's funny you should ask. - [laughs] Terry. - Have a look at what they're called. - Terry. Kind of appropriate, don't you think? I don't... You don't know what to say? Say thank you. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Thank you. - All right. - All right. [sighs] Now... As you know, There are certain conditions that have gotten your release. I do. There's quite a few, in fact, so we've... Jack. What? That's the name... That's the name I want. Okay. Jack. Well, that's the first thing taken care of. [Terry] So what are you thinking? Don't worry. The longer you spend here, the smaller it's going to seem, I promise. Yeah, lots of students, plenty of new faces, which will work out pretty well in your favor. Mmm. McDonald's. Mm? Oh, well, at least we know what we're having for dinner. [Woman] Hi. Hi, Miss Woolly. This is my nephew Jack. Jack, Miss Woolly. Come in, come in. [Miss Woolly] Sorry about the mess. - And it's Kelly, by the way. - Kelly. It's just that I'm on nights this week, so I'm actually not long out of bed. - Tea? - No, thank you. Coffee? Tomorrow morning, I'll show you where everything is... the washing machine, the dryer, whatever. You like your room, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Good, I'm glad. It's small, but it's clean. - Am I wrong? - [Jack] Uh-uh. Functional, and you've got the portable telly in there, although don't try getting ITV. It just won't pick up for some reason or other. Anyway... Sorry. Did you say you wanted a coffee or not? - Uh. - Mmm. So, tomorrow we go to the bank and we open up an account for you, okay? Because the more forms you fill in, the more real your name is going to become. Okay. What else do you want to do? Uh, well, what else can we do? Whatever we want. In two weeks time, you start work proper, so you need to experience as much as you can before then. Of course, your history has to become second nature, so I'm going to be going over it and over it - and getting it. - Yeah. I was wondering if m-maybe at some stage we could take a trip. To where? See Philip's grave. Think we could do that? Let me... Terry, no, if we can't, it's fine. Seriously, it's fine. Just let me think about it, okay? I'm not saying we can't go. Right. Yeah, right. Newton. What's that? It's where I'm from. What's your name? My name's Jack Burridge. And why are you here, Jack? Now, you got two numbers in your address book... mine and P.S. That's for Protection Squad. Okay? That's a special number. You call them, and they'll come running. - Oh. - All right? Now, just for tonight, there's two policemen. Just go there. Can you see them? Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. How do you feel? This is as bad as it's going to get. All right? Okay. Come here. You're going to be fine. Yeah? [sniffles] "Putting it into his pocket, he turned back the way he'd come "and went searching for home. But It was evening now, and growing dark." [Woman] Then what did he find when he got to the... A butterfly. I don't see any hands. A butterfly. Butterfly pendant, good. Okay, so who's going to continue? Mr. Wilson? Where's your book? How difficult can it be to remember... I'm sorry. I take it your homework's done? I forgot my copy. Sara, you continue. "He wanted to prove to his newfound friend "that by obtaining the pendant, he could be trusted with whatever task was put before him." [Boy] Hey, spastic! Hey, spastic, why is your face always dirty? And his clothes. Yeah, and your clothes, mate. It's because you're a spastic. I'm joking. Hey, stop, now. Come here for a minute. Why? I said we're joking. Come on, I'm teasing. Secret, we want to tell you a secret. [Man] Who's that? Is that you, Eric? Yeah. Come down here. Just a minute. Now. Your mother's sick, so don't go near her. - Sick? - That's right. Where is she? Didn't you hear what I said? Mum. Mum, are you okay? Would you like a cup of tea? Leave me alone. I had a fight, Mum. Leave me alone. Get out. Some boys, they... [sobbing] What did I say to you? [Man] Eric! [Boy] Hey. How do you get 500 cars in a shed? Put up a bingo sign. [laughing] What's your name? Eric. Want to see something cool? [tires screeching] [horns honking, crash] [Man] Bloody hell. What are you doing? You came straight at me! [Second man] Something hit me! What's yours? Huh? What's your name? Was it guilt, do you think? Who knows? Or... a way of saying sorry? [sighing] Was he sick of the world? We should go. This was a bad idea. Why? Because Philip... How many times have we talked about this? Sorry. Don't be sorry. I made a decision to take you. But we have to keep looking forward, not back. Okay? The you from then is dead as well. Or am I wrong? Jack. No, no. I'm all right. Okay. Right, come on. I want to go home before dark. All right. Drop that off. Come back, pick up something else. Take that thing wherever it needs to go, and so on. - Simple, yeah? - Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Now, you'll be partnered up with Chris Kelly, who should be here but... [knocking] Ah, Mr. Kelly. Glad you could join us. Sorry. This is Jack. By the way, I'm told you been to prison a couple of times. Yeah, but, I mean... Listen. I only bring it up to reassure you that your secret's safe. All right? I believe a man deserves a second chance. I also believe in his right to privacy. So, uh, mum's the word. Idiot, eh? You can say it. "Mum's the word." He's like David Brent or someone. Who? Yeah, very funny. So what were you in for? Unless you don't want to... No, no. Uh, stealing cars, you know, joyriding. Right. How many stints you do? Three. [laughing] Jesus. Yeah, after me last, me Uncle Terry suggested I make a new start somewhere else. Get away from bad influences? Yeah. Well, I can't guarantee that that's what you've done. - [Woman] Sophie McGee. - Present. Angela Milton. Present. Stuart Thompson. Present. Emily Upton. Present. Eric Wilson. Eric Wilson? [Philip] Swing. Swing and shoot webs. [making shooting sounds] [train passing] Turn green is what I'd like. Green? Yeah. Rip some bastard who was making me angry to bits. - [laughing] - Hello, mate. What's up? You both get off school? Answer me, man. Yeah. [laughing] What's your name? - Are you dumb? - [boy laughing] [imitating lisp] You a spastic? Your mate is spastic, mate. [boys laughing] Oh. All right, now. Fuck off. We're gonna have a little word with Eric here. What, are you deaf as well as dumb? Ah! Fuck, my nose! [grunting] - Oh, fuck! - Come on, lads! [train approaching] [groaning] [boy coughing] [Terry] So... So, yeah, now, it's... it's, um... it's really good. And this guy I work with, he's... Are you ready to order? Yep, sure. I'll have your tuna and cheese, thank you. Jack. Um... [Waitress] I can come back. No, no, hang on. It's all right. Take your time. Actually, could you come back? Thank you. Shit. It's okay, it is. What is that? What's a panini? It's a bread roll, toasted, flattened. It's nice. What's Mexican chicken? Spicy. So you were saying? So, now, yeah, it's been going really good. And the guy that you're working with... He's really nice. I feel like I'm getting the hang of things. - Cool. - Yeah. Um, we do a lot of loading, we do a lot of unloading. We do a lot of driving, so you know, it's not all hard work all the time, so... - Yeah, that's a bonus. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. By the way, um, I want to pay for this. - No. No way. - Come on. I don't know what to do with me wages. Trust me, that'll change. - Terry. - Believe me. Terry. Please, now, let me. Please. Well, okay. - [Waitress] Have you decided? - Yes. I will have... What was it? What was it again? - [laughing] - Don't fucking laugh at me. [knocking] Hello, Michelle? Chris. How you settling in, Jack? Strong and silent, yeah? Is that right? Does that mean you're never gonna offer to take me out for a drink? A drink? My God, it speaks, yeah? A drink. Uh... If you don't want to, that's fine. I just thought... Hey, why don't we all go out? Tomorrow night, pay day. Get the whole crew. You could do the inviting, Michelle. Give you something to do besides sitting around on your ass. Fuck you. [sighing] Saved you there, mate. She loves you best, that girl. Here. But what do I know? Maybe you're a Don Juan underneath that mild-mannered exterior. What you looking? Jack. Kick it on, bloke. Jack. Andalu. The White Whale, mate, Michelle? [laughing] What? Hey. Hi, Dad. So how's things? Okay. Your mother? I haven't seen her. Long time, huh? Listen, Dad. I'm kind of homeless at the moment. - Yeah? - And I was... Yeah, stay here. Is that what you were going to ask? - Mmm-hmm. - Yeah? Stay with me. There's plenty of room. [phone rings] [ring] Hello. Hang on. Sorry, mate. There's more beers in the fridge. Help yourself. Just, uh, try not to get too drunk, okay? Right, and listen. You keep your wits about you. Don't try and keep up with those guys. You sound worried. - Well, listen. - Oh, yeah? No. No, I'm not. I mean, you've got to start living, yeah? You know, the past doesn't equal the future. What does that mean? It means that you're entitled to some happiness, Jack. So you go out. You have a good time. Anything you're not sure about, any problems, you just call me, okay? And don't pay any attention to all that Forefront nonsense because that's all it is. Okay. [sighing] All right. Thanks, Terry. All right, man. I'll see you Wednesday, son. All right. All right. Bye. So where was this? In Birmingham. Only lasted six or seven months. What finished it? She went bananas. Did she? Or did it take you that long to work out she always was? So why you up here anyway? Work. And whales. Calica's going to release them, counselor. Looking after a whale. I cannot get over how old you look. Give me a break. No, no. I don't mean old. I mean... grown up. I'm not trying to embarrass you. I mean, I'm the one that looks old, right? I will take that smirk for acquiescence. I really despised you. No, no. No, no, no. Let me explain, me. Let me... All the shit that happened, I know it wasn't your fault. It was just shit that happens, right? But as a kid, the point of view you take - is the one that's given to you... - Your mum? Yeah, my mum. And I just want to tell you that I'd like to... now that I'm here and you're here and too many fucking years have gone by to... Fuck, it's so corny, to... To what? Make up for lost time? I suppose, yeah. What do you think? I think it does sound fucking corny. It does, don't it? Fucking hell. No, but seriously, nothing would make me happier, son. I really mean that. Daddy, no! No! Daddy, don't let him take me! [sigh] Very nice. Let me see. Oh, very nice. Whoever needs knocking dead, Jack, that's what you're going to do to him. - See you later. - See ya. Look at that. Yeah. What you think, Jack? What? He's got his mind on someone else. Who's that? The White Whale, mate. You are kidding. She's got her mind on him, if I'm not mistaken. You sure about that? Okay. [laughing] Probably for the best, eh? [Michelle laughing] [general chatter] She's looking for you. Fucking hell..."Where's Jack?" - Don't bother, mate. She's gone. - What, home? Out to the club. With who? I don't know. Claire, Lucy. Don't worry, mate. Night's not over yet. # Maybe we can make it all right # [Michelle] Jack. Jack, come over. # We can make it better sometime # Come on, Jack. # Maybe we can make it happen, baby # # We could keep trying # # But things will never change # # So I don't look back # # Still I'm begging with every step I take # # But I don't look back # # Just a little, little bit better # # Gonna live to waste some time # # Tell me would it make you happy, baby # [Jack] Where's Chris? Getting the drinks in. You all right? Yeah. You're a little bit drunk. And? [chuckling] Girls who dance like they're good in bed never are. Hey, listen, mate. She a good girl is the White Whale. Why do you call her that? 'Cause she's white and she's big, why else? No offense to her, mate, I'd give her a tumble or three. Seriously, she's funny, and she's brainy, too. I say, you want to go for it, mate, you go for it, yeah? Right, open your mouths. What was that? - An Elephant. - What? An "E." An "E"? Ah, fuck. Oh, relax. Oh, mate, I'm sorry. I should've... Oh, shit. What's his problem? I don't know. His parole. He's a sensitive guy, mate. What the fuck can I say? [Jack retching] Fucking heaven tonight, isn't it? Huh? Be lucky, mate. Who's she? Some bird he's been coddling for hours. Oh, yeah? What's her name? [laughing] Hi. Hi. You avoiding me? No. You sure? I mean, I thought this was our night, first of all. Yeah, it is. It is, but I'm... I'm kidding. I'm kidding, relax. You see Newton playing home tomorrow? You like the football, Jack? No, not really. Well, I'm glad you don't. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I find it a turn-on. - You okay, Jack? - Yeah. - You sure? - I love you. What? Jesus. Jack, you're drunk. No, no, I'm not, I'm not. I'm never... Never felt like this before. You're off your fucking head. - Aren't you? - What? No. Um, do you want to go for a dance? No, I don't want to dance. Look, Jack, I like you. I do. And I'd love to spend some time with you, but not like this. Jesus. I'll see you on Monday, yeah? What happened? Uh, I don't know. What the fuck? You decide not to trundle it? What? No, I thought I did... Oh, yeah. Shit, shit. Hey, relax. You can talk to her later.

He's got a way about him. [laughing] Yeah. You want another of these? Yeah, mate. [Girl cries out] - Hey, listen, mate. - No, listen, mate. This is between me and my girlfriend, so you would do better to stay out of... [scuffling] [Girl] Get out of the way. Come on, you old pervert. Come on. Get out of here. Hey! Aah! [grunting] Hey, hey, hey! Leave it. Leave it, hey? Leave it. Come on, Bruiser. You looked Steven fucking Seagal, mate. Yeah. It's just the come-down you're feeling. We'll drop you off first. Get some kip. You'll be all right in the morning. Van Damage, hey? Ungh! What a night. What a fucking night! [laughing] [Woman] Excuse me. What are you doing? Give me that. There's nothing in there for you. Does your father know you're hanging 'round shops - looking at... - Fuck you. Excuse me? Fuck you. My father's dead. Oh. I'm sorry. Oh. I'm sorry, sweetheart. [sniffles] - Oh, dear. - [sobbing] You poor love. It's all right. Dear. My mum's dying. Yeah? Of cancer. Well, not now. She will be. Right. She has it. In her tit? How did you know? Well, that's where they get it, women. Should've got Coke. Mmm, shit. I forgot. My mouth's all dry. Wanker. Pass me that ketchup, Jack, do you mind? [Man on TV] And the situation is still under review. Oh, nothing like a bit of ketchup. A man has been hospitalized and his house set on fire in a vigilante attack believed to be a case of mistaken identity. The 23-year-old man who had recently moved to Nottingham was reported to resemble an artificially aged photograph published in a leading tabloid newspaper of Eric Wilson. Wilson, the surviving murderer of ten-year-old Angela Milton who was known at his trial as Boy A, was recently released from prison. The Press Complaints Commission is still considering whether the release of the image contravened guidelines. It's not known whether this attack will affect their decision. And finally, there were celebrations tonight in Didsbury... Got to sign it, mate. You good? - No, I'll wait. - No, you won't. You're going in there, you're going to talk to her, Bruiser. - No, maybe next time. - Maybe never. You're going in, and that's that. You're going to invite her out, and she's going to accept. I'm getting tired of this ridiculousness. Hi. Hi. Thanks. See you. So, uh... So... do you want to do something tomorrow night? Just like that, eh? Yeah, that simple. Who'd have thought? I know. Thought what? That'd she'd ever want to see you again. Did you think that? Give me a break, Bruiser, will you? [both laughing] [doorbell rings] Would you like a lager? Well, all the shows start at 8:30, so... Oh. God, no, I, um... [chuckling] When I said a movie, I meant a DVD. A what? I've rented a couple. I meant for us to watch them here. Oh. Okay. Is that okay? I mean... Oh, yeah. That's fine. [laughing] So you'll have fun, yeah? [indistinct dialogue] So... why you been avoiding me? I don't know. The "I love you" thing, was it? - Oh, l... - It was sweet, Jack, but I know you didn't mean it. [laughing] No, l-l... It's just the way you came after me... Aren't I allowed? No, hey, you are. [chuckling] Of course you are. Just, uh... Ah... Why you? Yeah. Yeah, as opposed to... Because I like you. Isn't that reason enough? No, it is. But... What? But... but nothing. [laughing] Nothing. Just a bit surprised, that's just all. But in a nice way. [laughing] Yeah. I should hope so. Would you like another? Another what? Surprise. [Michelle] What do you think I think? That you're less than a man or some shit like that? Give me some credit, Jack. I just... I just wanted... What? I just wanted it to be right. And it will be. Let's go watch the other film. We'll have a drink. We'll cuddle. We'll treat this as a date where the woman didn't put out, all right? All right, Jack. What's this? [exhales deeply] [breathing heavily] Oh, fuck. [moans] Oh, Jesus. [moans] [moaning louder] Hey. [panting] What are you looking at? You. Why? Do you love me? Hey. Hey, come here. Come here. No, no. - It's okay. - [whimpering] It's okay, come here. Jack, it's okay. [sobbing] Oh, God. Hey. It's okay. [sobbing] Oh, God. Hey. [Chris] So... how'd it go? Good. Any action? I don't want to talk about it. Jesus. That's a yes. Shut the fuck up. Why not? Transcendent, was it? Fuck you. Eh? Sacrosanct? - Yeah. I understand. - [laughing] Just tell me one thing. What? Did you get a go on her tits? [laughing] [chuckling] - What the hell was that? - What? Jesus, Chris, stop the van. Aw, fuck. Hello? Ah, fuck! - [rattling door handle] - Oh, God. [grunt] Let's, uh, let's see if there's something in the boot. [grunting] Yeah. With this. Help me with this? If I can. [grunting] Come on. Come on! Oh, sh... [Girl coughing] [Jack] She's alive! Come on. Don't stop looking at me. All right? You okay? You're fine. Okay. Give us your knife, Chris. Give us your knife. You're all right, darling. - [Chris] Here you are. - [Jack] You're okay. Yeah, an ambulance, please. There's been a car accident. Okay, now hold on to me. Hold really tight. Yeah, there's the driver and a little girl. The driver. - Hold on tight. - Thank God. Hold really tight. I'm going to set you down on here. I can't see in. Just don't go, one minute. Okay. You're all right. Oh. shit. Aw, shit. Yeah, Chris. He has it, the knife. The leather man. For work? Yeah, yeah. Cut... Cutting, you know. Box-ties, wires, whatever. And that's what you used to cut it. Yeah. [Man on radio] The driver didn't make it. Right. Radio Carol. Get her over to the mother's. I knew he wouldn't. [applause] Bruiser! [laughing] Weird. Huh? This morning, he was alive. That guy? Now he's dead. Just hard to make sense of it. We should be part of it. Jacko. Mmm. We're so fucking delicate people. Die so easy. She didn't. No. The girl? - Yeah. - No. We did some serious saving today. You're a good guy, you, Jack. A good mate. That thing that you did for me at the party... What? Oh. Right. Jumping in there... shit. I just wanted to say if there's... if... if there's ever anything that you need or... or you want to talk about, mate... I mean it, yeah. Cool. Yeah, just wanted to, uh, just wanted to say that. Mate? Yeah? I think you're the best friend I ever fucking had. Me, too. The only friend, you mean. [chuckling] You ever get fucked by a guy? What? No. I did. Oh. Yeah? You remember my brother? Did... Did he put it right in? Mm-hmm, a lot of times. Did it hurt? What do you think? Just closed my eyes. Hmm? When he does it. Just close 'em. And I think of a room with hundreds of doors. Hundreds of doors, and they're closing. The one's furthest away first, and then getting closer, just closing, just banging shut. And I think, if I can keep from crying until the last one shuts... then I won't cry at all. And I don't. [TV chatter] You want some beers? Yeah. I took a 20 from your pocket, you mind? Blew it on the show. Save a couple for me, will you? Where you going? See one of my kids. Who is it? None of your business. Somebody trying to get back into the swing of things. What did he do? It's none of your business, either. It's what he's doing now that's important, yeah? His present. His past is moot. Mm-hmm. He just doesn't go out. He doesn't seem to have any friends. He's making no attempt to get a job. And... I'm just a bit worried he's depressed, you know? But then I look at you, who's doing so well. [chuckling] Come on, Terry. No, come on, you. You're out there saving lives, working, got yourself a girlfriend. How's that going? It's going good. Had sex yet? No, I'm sorry. I apologize. Yes, we have. Good. C-Can l... Can I say something about that, though? Of course. It's just... It's just starting to feel a little bit, um... dishonest, you know? Jesus, you really do like her, don't you? Listen, Jack. The distance that you have traveled since I first met you is nothing short of astonishing. It's an achievement. I mean, you've overcome obstacles that many if not most people would have fallen... Why Philip? [sigh] Why don't you say what you want to say? Say it. He didn't kill himself. Who killed him? Hmm? I tell you, this suspicion of yours is... Promise me. - What, that it was suicide? - Yeah. I promise. I promise you. Philip had to come to terms with what he did. Now, he took his own life because he was never able to do that. You did. You grew. You changed. You earned the right... You earned the right to be Jack Burridge. Because that's what this is, it's a fucking right. And Jack Burridge has not lied to that girl because Jack Burridge has done nothing to lie about. Do you understand me, Jack? Do you understand me, son? [TV chatter] [sigh] There's somebody here wants to see you, mate. - Who? - Don't know. Uh, by the loading bay with Dave and Chris. All right. Hey, Jack. Get over here, will ya? - This is Felix. - Hi. From the evening news. Wants to do a little piece, am I right? - On us? - Our daring rescue. Actually I'm only here to take the photo. Listen, I'm not really sure... What? Well, that I want my photo taken, all right? Why? Jesus, Jack, it's just a photo. Where do you want him, Felix? Beside the van will be good, yeah? Get the old logo in. Whatnot. [Felix] If you like. What about the hats, Dave? What? Get them in, too. That's a good idea. Carol, have we got any hats in there? What kind? - What do you mean "what kind"? - Our hats. DV? Well, that's the name of the company, isn't it? I'll have a look. Uh, a little to the left. - To the left! - They're fine. Fine. They're fine where they are. Okay, then. Got it. That's all right, isn't it? Yeah. Can you cut that down a bit? Just the sides. Just don't want my old mates to know where I am. Your mates from back home? - Yeah. - Jack, it's the evening news. - So? - The Manchester evening news. All right. God, you're paranoid. You know that? So listen, Steve's asked if you want to go for a game of pool tonight. - You up for it? - Oh, sorry, mate. - I'm seeing Michelle. - All right. How's it going with the White Whale anyway? - Ah, good. - And? Prefer if you didn't call her that anymore though. Ah, Jackie Boy, you've got it bad. I just don't see why everyone has to have a name. - Like Bruiser? - Yeah. Just the way the world works, mate. - We've all got to have one. - Yeah, well... But if Michelle's your preference, then... Michelle it shall be. Just don't forget my invite to the wedding. - Hey, hero. - [groans] Look what I got. Yeah. It's horrible. It's horrible. What are you doing? Why'd you lower your cap like that? Didn't realize I had. I love it. "Disregard for..." No wait. "Quick thinking and selfless disregard for their own safety." La, la, la. "Heroic actions." You know how proud of you I am? No. Very proud. Oh. I've got something for you. Oh, yeah? Happy Birthday. It ain't me... Yeah, I know. It's for the ones we missed. Oh, my... Could we have the bill, please? [sighs] Michelle... I don't know what to say. You like it, then? [laughs] Yeah, I love it. And that's only the first half. Well, what's the second? [laughter] All right, all right. - How about that? - Very good. It's very good. Nah, let's get serious about this. Give me a pout. A pout? All right. A fucking Page 3 pout. What? [laughs] You're fucking nuts. Carry on, keep going, keep going, keep going. Yeah. Oh, sultry. Very nice. [laughs] I don't even know what that word means. But I know I like it. - That's it? - Yeah, I think so. Show me. Oh, shit. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. And just when I was about to start my porn routine. [laughs] [moaning] Where are we going? What? Is this the way? This is our way, right? We've done it loads of times, Jack. And this way we're going to save, like, an hour. That's right. We're just taking a short cut. We're not doing anyone any harm. Done this before? - Yeah. - Yeah. Like loads of times. Fuck it. Come on, then. - Oh, shit. - What? That wasn't there the last time. Come on, Jack. Jack, come on. [screaming] Don't like it! Oh-ho-ho-ho! What's next? Do you want to grab some food? I'm starving. Jesus Christ, look at Bruiser. Man, you are fucking green! [laughter] Man, you are. You're fucking green! Don't fucking touch me. The Bruiser! [laughs] [people screaming] Jack, Kelly must know by now. Nah, she don't, she don't. She gets in ready for work, - so she wouldn't know. - Right. Although maybe she does, I don't know. That's three times this week. You know that? What? You've stayed over. Oh. You got a problem with that? Not at all. I'm just, you know... Right. You're informing me. Bringing the... yeah. What? The fact to your attention. Enlighten you to it. Well, I appreciate it. What is it? A rubber johnnie. What's it for? Are you stupid? Shagging women. If you don't wear one, you get a sore on your dick. Want to see it? - Eww. - Exactly. Try and find something to dig with. What about this one? Perfect. Cut the little bits off with this. They like the darkness under the bridge, you see. Like trolls? No. Where are the trolls, mate? Fuck. - You see it? - Yeah. You see the size of it? Shit. Grab it. - What? - Grab it! Jesus. Bollocks. Wow. Yeah. Why isn't it dead? It's not far from it now. [soft laughter] Look at that one. Oh, wow. You want it? Take it. You might be alone sometime and need it. You know what I mean? [laughs] So I take it you're staying over tonight? Huh? Yeah. I would have thought... what's this? No, that's cool. There's you. So cute. What's up, Jack? Have you... Have you slept with many blokes? I don't know. A few. I mean, I've never slept around. All right. What about you? Nah, I ain't slept with many girls. And your past? - That is my past. - No. I mean your past... the cars, your time in prison. What about it? It's really over, right? Of course it is. Why? Why do you... No, I just... Because I want you to say. - Say what? - Forget it. I think I'm in love with you, Michelle. Yeah? [whispers] Yeah. I think I'm in love with you. What was, what was you going to say, then? That's it. - Wha... - It's all right. You beat me to it, you asshole. Oh, shit! I can't. I can't fucking stay. Oh, fuck. Kelly lost her house key. I've got to... I've got to let her in in the morning. - Oh, no. - Shit. I'll call you a taxi. No, no, no. Don't worry about it. There's always plenty up on the main street. I tell you what. What? I never thought... in my life... Shit. That I would ever say those words. Or have 'em said to me. - Yeah. - Do you know, do you know? Now I have someone. A girl who makes me... Sometime... when I ain't seen ya and then I see ya... I find it hard to breathe. This is getting serious, isn't it? Are you fucking mad? No, no, no. You can never do this. You understand what I'm saying? You can never ever do this. Never! - Never? - Never, never. She would understand. I know it. Listen, listen. Her understanding's not the issue, okay? Knowledge is the issue. Your safety is the issue. Okay? Do you, do you know... Fuck it. There's been a bounty posted for you on the internet. A what? For information regarding your whereabouts. Now listen, I wasn't going to tell you. Am I in danger? No, no, no, no. But do you now realize there are people out there who want you? They hate you. They will never let go of what happened. Ever, ever! How much is it for? That doesn't matter. Terry, how much is it for? Oh, fuck. But listen, you're safe. You're safe as long as nobody knows. So you have to be strong. You have to stick by the game plan. However strongly you may feel this urge, however right you may feel it is to follow it, you can't. And I want you to promise me, Jack, that you won't. Now, you promise me. Will you do that for me, son? Will you promise me that you won't? [crying] It's so fucking hard. I know. [Man] And as we heard from the recordings from each boys' willingness to extricate himself from blame at the expense of the other, both of them are to blame. Both committed the act, though neither will accept responsibility, let alone provide a reason for their actions. Though why should they? And if they did, would it be sufficient to explain the loss of this beautiful, this innocent child? Who once, so brim-full of potential, will now never have it realized. Who has been, in the most violent manner imaginable, wiped off the face of the earth. What reason could be good enough? None. None but this. That they are bad. No, no other description will do. That they are evil. But more crucially, that they are dangerous. And that they must... not as punishment, no, that's irrelevant as is the hope of rehabilitation... But that they must, for the sakes of our children, all of them, for their safety and well-being, be sent away for as long as is lawfully possible. [Man, clapping] That's right! Lock them up! - Amen. - [crowd claps] Daddy, no! No, Daddy, don't let them take me! No, don't let them take me away! Mommy, please! No! No, Daddy! Daddy, no! No! This bloke should die? Hmm? Look at his hair. Why don't you ever go out, Zeb? I don't know. Meet any friends since you got here? I'm fine, Da. I don't think so. You're always drinking. I mean, don't get me wrong, I enjoy a bit, son, but is it healthy? That's rhetorical, by the way. I know. Now, I know that it's not healthy. And what I'm trying to tell you is that... Fuck, I'm pissed. [scoffs] What, that you're pissed? No, no, l... Thank you. You should be out there getting a life. Doing something. I'm not trying to tell you what to do, but I don't like seeing you lying around night after night. So do something useful and pour me something, would ya? - [laughs] - [laughs] Cheers. [sighs] Fuck it, you're right. What's that? His hair is ridiculous. - [laughs] - [laughs] Hmm. Forget it all, son. You're young. Plenty of time to sort yourself out and get your act together. I love you, Jack. You're my greatest fucking achievement. Where's Michelle? She rang in sick this morning. Oh. [whispering] All right, Michelle, um, uh... I just heard you were sick. Uh, I hope you're not feeling too bad. Uh... just wondering. I c... I can... I can drop over after work if you want. It... It's a cold, yeah? Love you. [loud beeping of truck backing up] [doorbell rings] [knocking] Michelle? [doorbell ringing repeatedly] I don't know. I think she might be at her mum's. Well, have you rung her? Yeah, her phone's switched off. Well then, how do you know she's not alone? Because I've been out there twice. So ring her mum. No. I ain't got her number, have I? All right, look, you know what? Claire will probably know. Let me give her a call, and I'll call you back. She says she ain't heard from her in a couple of days. Okay. What about boyfriends? I'm her boyfriend. No, ex-boyfriends. Did she ever mention any... No, no, no one. Shit. You think she's hurt. - No. - Yeah, you do. Just let me think a minute. Do you think I hurt her, Terry? What? Do you think I hurt her? No. Never. Never, Jack. I'll make some calls when I get back. Make sure her car hasn't been in an accident or something. In the meantime, you just... Thank you. - Wait and see. - Thank you, Terry. Yeah. [rope creaking] [phone rings] Oh, fuck, fuck! [ring] [ring] [ring] [ring] [ring] [ring] [ring] [ring] - Jack, Dave. - Hello. Listen, we're not going to need you at work today. Oh, why not? Or for the foreseeable future. What've I done? Don't come to the depot again. Do you understand? We'll send you what you're owed in wages. Wait. Dave, Dave? Um, uh, just... Goodbye, Jack. Oi, mate, it's Jack here. Hey, um, Dave just called me. Told me not to come in. He obviously knows you're not who you say you are. Is he wrong? Chr- Chris? No, of course he's not. You've got to just listen to me. - Where's Michelle? - What? Is she hurt? Have you hurt her, you fuck? How could you ask me that question? You're a murderer, aren't you? - Who says? - Everyone. How could we have been so blind to allow you to... - You've got to please, Chris... - No, Jack. I'm done with you. Chris? Chris, mate. Chris? [sigh] [Terry's voicemail] Sorry I can't take your call... Oh, for fuck's sake, Terry! [breathing heavily] Anything you want to say? [Men talking all at once] Do you think you're rehabilitated? Do your neighbors not have the right to know? Sorry I can't take your call right now. Oh, fuck, Terry. Just leave your name and number... Terry, Terry, Terry. Fuck, fuck, fuck! Shit. No, I ain't that boy. No, I ain't that boy. [crying] No, I ain't that boy. No, I ain't that boy. I ain't that boy. Fuck! Fuck! I ain't that boy. Please. No! [sobbing] Sorry I can't take your call right now. Just leave your name and number, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you. Bye. Aah! - What you doing? - Huh? That's vandalism. Have you nothing better to do? - [laughs] - What? How about what you were doing earlier? Excuse me? Kissing and stuff. You know. You did with... You saw that? You spying little shitbags. Hey, watch it. Don't threaten me. - I will if I want. - You won't. I will if I want. Who the hell do you think you are? Look at you. When's the last time you had a bath? - Ah... - Scum. - What? - Scum is what you are. And you. Why on earth would any girl... [gasp] Would any girl what? Would any girl want to... - Aah! - Would any girl what? Would any girl what? I'm gonna tell my dad. Aah! Get off me! You... aah! - [growling] - Get off! [girl screams] Come on! Aah! Get off! Get off me! Get off me! Aah! Aah! Help! Help me! - Aah! - Come on! Aah! No! [cough] - Aah! - Come on! Help me! Aah! [train whistle] Aah! Oh, fuck! [train horn] [breathing heavily] [door opens] [crying] Tickets, please. Ticket, sir. Oh, can I get one now? - Sure. - I had to run for the train. Where to? Where are you going to? All the way. - Return? - Sorry, no. Single. Single. All the way. That's 10.30, please. - Get up. - Hey! You fucking little cunt. You fucking little cunt. Why? - Why'd you do it? - Do what? How'd you do it? Was it my laptop? You shouldn't leave shit lying about. How'd you get the password? You had it taped underneath the fucking thing. Where's my phone? Where's my fucking phone? Trainer. Have you any idea what this has cost me? Have you any idea what it's cost that kid? And what did he cost me? What? Him and the others, what did he cost my mum? - What the fuck are you talking about? - She left me. Ah, she didn't! She took you! In all that time, you couldn't have come even once to see me? What... not once, not even once! It took me to come to you, and you don't even want me here! - What? - Don't say ya do. - It's Haddon! - Who? Eric, Jack... whatever his fucking name is! Jack... your greatest fucking achievement! - Zeb... - Get away from me! [crying] A monster, Da. A monster over me! Well, I hope he suffers. I hope they crucify him! Do you hear me? I hope he fucking rots! I hope he rots. Love? Excuse me, love. Oh, thank God. I thought you were dead there for a second. This is the end of the line, love. I'm sorry? This train doesn't go any further. Thank you. ## [merry-go-round music] Hi. What are you doing here? - Thinking. - What about? About you. I see you're in the papers again. Yeah. It wasn't me that told them. I never thought it was. So how come you're here? I'm escaping. A good a place as any. You see the tower? Yeah, how could I miss it? You like it? Oh, I love it. I would have forgiven you. Would you? Given time. [sniffs] It's not about you anymore, though, is it? No. Anyway, I've got to go. You coming this way? [whispers] No. Okay. I'll see you around, Jack. I love you. Damn. You beat me to it again. [Jack] Oi, Terry. Yeah, they know. Everyone knows now. I'm on me own now. I can't go back... being that other person because that other person is dead. Remember you said that? Anyway, sorry I let you down. Thank you for trying, Terry. I love you. Chris, it's Jack. It was always Jack. I wanted to tell you the truth, mate. I really, really did. But just because I couldn't don't mean I lied to you. I hope you can understand that. And I hope that you know just how much you did for me. So I'm just gonna say goodbye now. You remember that girl? Remember we saved that girl, mate? You remember that.
