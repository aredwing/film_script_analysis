(Engine chuffing) (Guard calls out) (Engines hissing and chuffing) Hello there! - Vronsky Vronsky - Ah. Good morning. Ah, you can't hear yourself speak with this blasted noise. Well, what brings your lordship out so early? My mother, on the Petersburg train. And you? The same, a woman. Ha-hai Honi soit qui mal y pense. lt's my sister, Anna. - Anna Karenina. - Oh, yes, of course. - You know her husband, the minister. - Oh, by name. Well, he's famous. Yes, he's bursting with brains - and cold as a pickled carp. - Not my line. Yes, he gives me the shivers. So does this blasted cold. - What time's the train due in? - 7:15, and she's late. Yes, and they'll be frozen. There's not a single coach with the heaters working, so they tell me. l've only just got up. How about some tea? - Haven't been to bed yet. - Oh, good for you. Still that little diva from the opera? - No, she's gone back to Milan. - Oh, my sympathies. Well, we must celebrate! How about a banquet? - The Angleterre! - No, the Hermitage. l owe them more money. l say, what about Kitty? Isn't it all fixed up between you and my pretty sister-in-law? Not so loud, Stiva. And you're the one who poked fun at husbands. Oh, but you're right, it's a ghastly business. Ah. Well, the train's been signaled. - What is a ghastly business? - Marriage, dear boy. - Don't let me put you off, but... - Ah! Stiva. - Have you been on a spree again? - No, no, nothing of the kind! l swear it on the heads of my five children. A spot of bother with a governess. Stiva, Stiva... You can shake your head, old man - you're a bachelor, you've got a pretty uniform. - Me, l'm desperate. - What, as bad as that? Oh, we manage to keep up appearances, thank the Lord, but l have to camp out on the sofa. Dolly's chased me out of the bedroom. And why? Nothing! A little piece of foolishness with a schoolmistress, l ask you, from Paris. Yes. But when she said, ''Monsieur le Prince Oblonsky, mon amour,'' - well, how could l resist it? - (Engine chuffing) ls that the train? No. Some shunter. Well, Dolly got to know, the Lord knows how, then bang, lightning, house upside down, children running wild, French girl sacked, and the English governess for good measure. And old Patrona asking me to pray for forgiveness. Now, what do you think of that? - Cigar? - No. - (Whistle ) - l've implored Anna to help me out. - Have courage, she will. - Yes, she's the soul of virtue, but she understands. The worst of it is, we're receiving the Grand Duke tomorrow. - You're coming, by the way. - Yes, but... But nothing, dear boy. Mind you, l'm desperate. l love Dolly, but she takes things to heart so much. She... (Sighs ) Oh, well. (Stationmaster) Express train from St. Petersburg arriving platform six. Stand back, stand back, please. Express train from St. Petersburg. - Stiva, you're on the wrong platform. - Oh, Lord! Masha, Masha, the yellow valise. - (Guard) Moscow! Moscow! - Well, thank heaven we've arrived. And the pillows. Oh, you're dropping everything. And the samovar. l am dying for a glass of tea. Well, take the things onto the platform, stupid. Find a porter. Now, don't move. Masha will see to all the luggage. Oh, what an unbearable journey. But you charmed the hours away, absolutely charmed them away. - Mother! - Alexis! - Oh, my dear! (She chuckles ) - Steady. There, dear. Well, you got my telegram at least. - Yes. Did you have a good journey? - Oh, l'm broken in pieces. Masha! She's dropped the Scotch traveling rug. Oh, find some boiling water, do, Alexis. Twenty-two hours without my tea, and shaken about like a demented tambourine. lf it hadn't been for Madame Karenina... ls she with you? Her brother's looking for her. Her husband asked me to chaperone her. Such an intelligent man. She's tout fait charmante! I'll present you. Masha, where are my gloves? Oh. She's made quite a conquest of me. l can say that at my age. We talked of nothing but our sons. She has a little boy to whom she's quite devoted. Oh, now. Oh, my handsome Alexis. What are these rumors l hear about a superb marriage? Mama, nothing has been settled yet. Vronsky... Ah, Countessi How are you, Prince Oblonsky? Pink and well, as usual, l see. And what does Dolly say to that? - Well, she's delighted! - l'm sure she is. l am sure she is. Anna! There you are, my dear. Allow me to present my son. Count Vronsky, Madame Karenina. - (Metallic scraping) - (Man ) Watch it! (Woman screams ) (Men shouting in distance ) - Here, what's happened? - An accident during the shunting, to one of the gangs. Please keep calm! Everything's being done. Please keep calm! Masha, my smelling salts! Oh, these railways. First my tea, now something else. When l was young, l was taken by troika to be presented to the Tsar, wrapped in furs. l was ready for anything... ..tipped out into the snow three times! As many bruises as there were pearls around my neck. But these engines are the death of you! Stiva, what has happened? He's... He's dead. Oh, it was quite instantaneous, but his wife was there, she saw it happen. - Give her this. - No, it's quite all right, Vronsky's seen to that. He's given her 2,000 roubles. But there was a horde of small children. Mother. Allow me to kiss your little face. We shall meet again soon, l hope. Well, goodbye, Countess. - Well, tomorrow evening, then, Count. - Till tomorrow. Masha! Oh, she's dropping everything! - (Whistle ) - My nerves won't stand any more. Where are the porters? Porter! - That was a warning. - What? - The death. - Oh, don't tell me you believe old wives' tales. Oh, Anna, you're here, that's the main thing. You're my only hope. Dolly's threatening to leave home and go to her mother, and we're giving a ball tomorrow night. - How long have you known him? - Hmm? - Vronsky. - Oh, always known him. Yes, and now he's going to be one of us. He's marrying Kitty. Ah, porter. Madame's luggage. And don't forget those two pieces up there. Stiva, what have you been up to? Oh, nothing, nothing, upon my soul. No, erm... Dolly's tired, that's the top and the bottom of it. You know, five pregnancies in a row. Yes, but you can't let her go now, you must make her see sense. (Countess ) Ah, that's better. Brinka! You're suffocating him, you idiot. He's not a cheese! Alexis, take him. Alexis! Ah, elle est charmante, n'est-ce pas? Yes, charming. (Whistle ) l'm not at home! I refuse to see anyone! - Dolly! For the love of God! - No! No one! - But the guests are arriving. - What do l care? - And the Grand Duke is coming. - You can look after the Grand Duke. - Without you? Impossible! - Get away from me, you. - But you told me that you'd forgiven me. - Oh, yes, forgiven... - Why, only yesterday you told Anna. - Leave Anna out of it, if you please. - I...I know I'm a brute. - You, a brute? Oh! just because l was carried away for a few minutes... - Carried away? - Dolly, nine years of life together. - Go away. - Dolly, please put your gown on. Don't touch me! Go away. - l love you, Dolly. - Go away, go away. You're killing me. You're a stranger to me. - A stranger! (Sobbing) - All right, all right, but for mercy's sake, stop crying, the servants will hear you. God, it's hot. Haven't got my tie on. - Well, what do you want? - The guests are arriving, Excellency. Well, what do you expect me to do about it? - Your coat, Excellency. - Oh, yes, my coat. Oh, Matvey. - Shall l ask Madame Karenina? - Yes, go and find her! Oh, and, Matvey... l suppose nothing's ready. Madame has given all the necessary orders. Oh! Darling, you're a darling! In spite of everything, you've... Oh, you're an angel. Oh, Dolly, if only you could understand how unimportant all this is. Well, l mean, of course it's serious, yes, very serious. - You remembered the champagne? - From Lo. - And the brandy? - '68 Rserve. Darling, look at me! - Never again, l swear it on... - (Sobbing) Oh. That's... (Dolly sobbing) Oh, Anna, Anna, l implore you. Go and put your coat on, Stiva. - But the Grand Duke is coming! - Go and put your coat on. Thank you, Anna. Thank you very much. - l wish l were dead. - You love him. Forgive him. You forgave him yesterday. When l think of him with that woman, here in this house! - l know. - l had such trust in him. How can you understand? You're happy. - l loved him, Anna, l loved him so much. - You still love him. l hate him. You love him. Oh, forgive him. He's suffering too, in his own way. He's suffering? You know what he did? The night of our quarrel he went straight off to the casino and had supper with a lot of dancing girls. Suffering! - You're his wife. - His habit. It's the same thing for a man. Five children, and he gets into debt and runs after women. Is this a life? And your life, Anna... you're happy at least? Oh, l have my little Sergei. Ah, yes. And you're a great lady, you go to court. And then Alexis Karenin never. No, never. Only l don't love him. And did you think l could, Dolly? That statue? You wrong me. l'm a woman. But everyone thinks you're happy with Karenin. Good, that's how l want it to be. Let them envy my happiness. You know how it used to be the fashion to wear masks, Dolly? Well, that's my happiness. That surprises you. Oh, l've wept too, Dolly, l've rebelled against this marriage, against my parents who forced it on me as though it were an unbelievable good fortune. But then l had Sergei. l'm resigned. You? That shocks you? Oh, l know l used to be so full of hope at one time. Well, now l'm in a hurry to grow old. There'll be peace, Dolly, afterwards. Anna! A woman's life is short. - (Sobs ) - Oh, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly. You're not going to start crying again on my account. Now think of yourself. And of Stiva waiting to be forgiven. Oh, you're good, Anna. l'm glad you came. How beautiful you are. - My hair's coming down. - (Stiva ) Dolly! l shall go upstairs to dress, Stiva. But remember, l am only doing it for the sake of the children, for Grisha and Misha. And Ania and Tania and little Monia. Only for them. Oh, Anna, Anna, you're wonderful! And you're a lunatic. Now, don't you dare start anything again. No, no, no, of course not. Oh, thank you, little sister. l'm happy, so very happy. - Then go up to Dolly and make her happy too. - Yes, l'll go at once. She's a wonderful woman, you know, Anna. She even remembered the champagne. Oh, er, if any of the guests... l'll take care of everything. Ah... my Anna. And all for a man like Karenin, - that pickled carp. - Shh. (Humming happily) (Anna ) Only friends in here, Matvey, do you understand? - Are the guests being entertained? - Yes, excellency. But it is not housekeeper's work. Matrona is quite overwhelmed. The Prince and Princess will be joining them at once. Thank you, excellency. May l ask your excellency for news of Master Sergei? lndeed you may, Matvey. There you are. There he is. Oh, he has grown into a fine little gentleman. But they've cut off all his curls. Quite the young man. lt's better that way. He's adorable. Oh, Kitty! The best flower of the ball. - Oh, Anna. - What is it? - l thought you'd come in mauve, not black. - Why mauve? Or lilac - at least it's more romantic. Quelle horreur. Don't you love me still, even in black? Oh, l do, l do, it's terribly distinguished. Well, l felt quite certain that you'd come in pink. What does it feel like to be eighteen? Nineteen. Oh, dreadfully old! Oh, l know. Oh, l felt just like that when l was nineteen. ln red stockings and a little satin cloak! And l'd sit with my cheek against the window, looking out into the snow - and dreaming. - Oh, l know. Feeling the dark room behind you and the warmness, and wondering... wondering who will be coming down the street. ls he coming? ln his uniform. Anna, l think he's going to speak to me. Oh, don't be frightened. You're very pretty. l don't mind about other men, but somehow... somehow when l'm with him l can...l can hardly breathe. - ( # Waltz playing) - Oh... Oh, Anna, it's going to be a lovely ball. You're so young. So very young. Don't you love dancing? But you're the most beautiful of all. Anna, say something to him. - To Vronsky? - Speak to him, say something nice about me. - You've met him. - You don't need me. Besides, you should ask Dolly, you know that. Oh, Dolly. Would you? Yes, l will. Oh! Anna, thank you! You've got my life in your hands. My whole life. Ladies, ladies, what's this? Not dancing? Anna Karenina, shame on you! For shame, are you in hiding? Ah, ravissante! Parfaitement ravissante. Mademoiselle Kitty. Now come, on with the dance. Oh, no, l don't feel in the least like it, Korsunsky. The queen of the ball?. Oh, come now, Madame Karenina. - just once round the room, it's nearly finished. - Please... Anna. - lf we must. - Bravo! Ah, Vienna! What rhythms! (Hums along) Good evening, Count. Good evening, Kitty. Nice gown. - Do you like it? - Yes. Very much. Like a dream you float, dear lady! That's Anna Karenina. l know. ( # Waltz ends ) The next mazurka? With pleasure. - (Korsunsky ) Encore, encore! - No. - Bis, bis! - No, no, no, not now. Then some champagne. Allow me to get it for you. And Miss Kitty of the pink feathers, something for you - a water ice? - l'll come with you. - No, wait, Kitty. Nothing? Oh, but l insist on the krakowiak after the mazurka. Orchestra! He's quite mad, Korsunsky... (All talking at once ) (Kitty giggles ) We're all talking at once. ( # Orchestra playing) The mazurka. You are enjoying Moscow, madame? Very much. An old city filled with legends and scandals. l love the legends. Do you find my presence disturbing, madame? No. Forgive me, l... l'm still nervous from yesterday. - The accident? - l still hear that poor woman scream. l shall never forget it. What has happened to her, do you know? She is being helped. She'll be able to live. ls that a blessing? To live? l think so, since yesterday. - What do you mean? - Shall l go on? No, l don't understand you. l'm sorry. What l want to say is quite commonplace. lt just happens that l have never said it before in my life. Count Vronsky. l know. l have no excuse. There is nothing between us but the sound of the train, and death. - Take pity on me. - Are you mad? Perhaps. Yes, l am. Don't go. Please don't go. The mazurka! (Vronsky ) l frightened you? lt is l who is afraid. My life is in your hands. Kitty loves you, Count Vronsky. - l am sorry about that. - ls that all?. What else is there? lt's finished. Love her. ls that an order? All right. You won't see me again. - But you've done for me. - l? At the first glance, as if you'd taken a gun and shot me. You don't know the power you have, Anna Karenina. Do you think l wanted this? - Please go. - Then send me away. l can bring you happiness, despair, love. Quiet. The mazurka! l'm sorry, Kitty. lt-lt's finished. Count Vronsky, l must have a word with you in front of Kitty. (Korsunsky ) Krakowiaki Krakowiaki lnto the ballroom, all of you. But l warn you, it's complete disaster - the Grand Duke is treading all over the ladies' trains. Now then, you with Madame Karenina, Vronsky, and Mademoiselle Kitty with me. Mademoiselle? - Ohhi - Oh, l l l! - Take her to the sofa. - Sorry, l feel sick. - (Sobs ) - Korsunsky, some smelling salts. Oh, l l l, yes. Oh, what a commotion! (Kitty sobs ) - Oh, Kitty. - (Sobs ) Oh, Kitty darling. Kitty. - (Train whistle ) - (Guard) St. Petersburg! St. Petersburg! Express train from Moscow, half an hour late. Express train from Moscow, half an hour late. (Engine chuffing) (Train doors slamming) (Engine hissing) (Hissing stops ) (Man singing) (2nd man ) Pull her out. And take a look at the wheel in number 28. Come on, get a move on. (Hammering, man chattering) (Door opens ) Guard, could you turn down the heating here? lt's... - My respects and apologies. - (Whistle ) (Train whistle ) (Engine chuffing) - Are you going to Petersburg? - Since you're going there, yes. l raced the train with my carriage. l'm glad the snow held you up. May l sit down? You are mad, l think. l agree. You know that Kitty is ill. Yes. lt doesn't seem to touch you. l can scarcely forgive myself. On the contrary. l am heartbroken, but there's nothing l can do about it. You can. Go back to her. We can be friends. l love you. Oh, yes, you love me. Forget. One forgets a dream. lt wasn't a dream. l love you. No. Are you afraid? l want to keep my peace of mind, Vronsky. And mine? What about me? - l've told you you've done for me. - Please go. All right. You go your way, l shall go mine. But we'll be together all the same. You are me. l am you. We are one. Goodbye, Count Vronsky. l accept my suffering. l don't ask for anything else. But don't send me away. No. l won't send you away. Goodbye. (Train whistle ) At last. Well, my dear, did you have a pleasant journey from Moscow? Did you teach your brother, Stiva, a lesson? l left a cabinet meeting especially to fetch you. Now l see l'm not to be thanked. Well, have you no word? Upon my soul, l don't think you recognize me. Your husband, Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin. Hmm? Let us go home. (Humming) (Horse neighs softly) # l might as well be # Where the mountains of Mourne # Sweep down to the sea # (Humming) Morning, Cord. Where can l find Count Vronsky? His lordship's in the stable, sir. Do you want me to fetch him? No hurry. - Getting ready for the big day? - Yes, sir. Spring's come on us sudden. Always does in St. Petersburg. This saddle's galling, Cord. Got a bruise on the right fetlock too. See that it's bandaged, will you? Hello, Makhotin. - How's Moscow? - Dreary. All the girls are asking about you. The regiment's gone into mourning. What are you entering for the steeplechase? Ask my trainer. He decides. We're trying to try our luck on Frou-Frou, sir. Oh, fine animal, should win. She'll have her work cut out against your Gladiator. He's only saying that to put me off, the old rascal. - He knows you're the better jockey. - lt's stamina what counts. l'll look at her bruise, sir, and get a muzzle on her before the stable lads fill her with sugar. Good. - Capable fellow, your Englishman. - Mm. Now look here, Vronsky, when do we see you again? Are you coming back to Moscow? No. Yashvin has lent me a couple of rooms here. The place is overrun with women. Yashvin! He's killing himself, the lunatic. Running after that baroness and four or five others. One woman's enough, what? - Wouldn't you say? - Aye. Well, come on, my dear chap. ln the mess, they dribble away about nothing else - - your grande passion. - Which one? l have several. Well, damn it, there's no need to be so confounded discreet. We take on luster from you, my boy. You've never flown so high before. Someone is fooling you, Makhotin. There is no passion at the moment. - But... But l heard it from... - Then they were mistaken. You mean to say you don't even know her name? What's all the fuss about? You can tell me. There is no one. Get that in your head and remember it. l say... how am l supposed to take that? How it was intended - in a friendly spirit. Friendly spirit? Right, we'll say no more, then. l'll look you up in your hermit quarters one of these days, huh? You're welcome. l've nothing to hide. Prends garde. Goodbye. Well, l should say we had a most successful evening. - He's fast asleep. - Hmm? Good, good. - Have you sent Annushka off to bed? - Yes. Why keep her up so late? - She forgot to draw the curtains. - Leave it. l like the air. As you please, my dear. Do you know what the Tsar said before he left? He's putting me in charge of their business. You know, that irrigation project in Zaraisky. Now, l have some very firm ideas on the subject. First, it is essential to have a commissioner instead of a... Am l boring you? - Will you unhook my dress? - Certainly, yes. l was very glad to see you talking with the Tsarina. We talked about our children. She disapproves of the English education system. Oh? Prince Serpukhovskoy was blazing with orders as usual. Did you notice? He has a mania for collecting that trash. - You wear a great many yourself. - Oh, as a duty. l'm out of that arena, l hope. Now, there is a bill l want to promote to the council tomorrow. l shall bring back a couple of ministers for dinner. l'm afraid we will be a little late. There, that's the last hook. - Anna? - Mm-hm? - Can you give me a moment? - Now? Please. Well, is it really necessary? l'd like to go to sleep. l'm sorry. Very well. l must put you on your guard, Anna. On my guard? For what? You have committed an indiscretion. l should like to think it was, er, thoughtlessness. Your animated tte--tte with Count Vronsky this evening did not pass unnoticed. Oh, really, you're always the same. lf l am bored, you're offended with me, - and if l am entertaining myself... - (Snapping sounds ) For heaven's sake, leave your hands alone. You think that l am capable of anything so commonplace as jealousy? - Where are you going, Anna? - l'm listening. The world is merciless, Anna. One does not violate certain conventions with impunity. The long and short of it is that this evening, to judge by the general impression, you were lacking in good form. Now, l have no right, Anna, l consider it even dangerous to go too deeply into your feelings - that is the concern of your conscience and that alone - but l am bound to recall you to your obligations to me. We are joined forever, Anna. Forever. ls this going to be a sermon, Alexis? l am dropping with sleep. Now this is a serious matter, Anna. Take care. Animated! Count Vronsky talked about his horses, nothing else. Who brought all this nonsense to you? Your old samovar Lydia, l suppose? Leave Countess Lydia out of this, Anna. l am speaking in your interest. My position enters into it of course. Oh, yes, that before everything. Oh, you are wrong. l love you. Really? When have you ever told me so? Are words necessary? Was that Sergei? No. No. Now, Anna, all this may appear strange to you, l do not really enjoy making speeches, but there is an hour that strikes for every married couple, and this evening l felt it with some keenness. You have dropped a pin. My position is established now. We have a son. lf you don't want to think of me, think of him. - Oh, l do. - Yes, Anna. Do so, do so. Now, l repeat, l am your husband, your legal protector, but the tendency of manners today runs counter to marriage. Don't rely on it, Anna. A man can divorce, a woman never. Are you accusing me? lf my words have been at all justified, Anna, if you feel the smallest degree troubled... - Really, this is too ridiculous. - You know what l represent in Russia. For my work, l need calm, l need strength. lf there is anything you wish to tell me, Anna. Tell you what? There is nothing? No. Good. Then it's over and done with. (Snapping) Oh, dear. Ha-ha. What a bad habit that is of mine. You're very attractive tonight, Anna. - You're tired. - Mm, l am a little, yes. l see... and obey. - Good night. - Good night. May l take the lamp? l have a report to finish off. Why do you not go to bed? l'm listening to Sergei. Poor little lamb, how he sighs. Sleep well. lt is late. Too late. Too late. ( # Lively folk music) (Vronsky ) Oh! lt is you. There's not a soul here. We're alone. - You're unbearably beautiful. - l was so afraid it was wrong of me to come. No, it's quite safe. l gave orders. Give me your hands. - Your scent... - This is a caf, is it not? No, no, no, the officers come here at night only, but during the day it's given over to students, poets... and lovers. Oh, Alexis. Oh, l can't stand this. l must touch you, my mouth on your cheek. - l can't stand it, Anna. l want you. - Be quiet. You don't love me, not the way l love you. All you think about is your child, if you're recognized. You belong to me. Divorce Karenin. - But my son, my little one. - You'd still have him. Oh, do you think so? l left my carriage at the corner of the Sadovaya. l came by the back streets on foot. - No one could tell me the way, l was frantic. - Yes. Then l found a cab. lt had yellow seats and the coachman smelt of tobacco. l looked out of the window at the houses but l saw only one face all the time. Your face. l'm not used to happiness. (Sighs ) How terrible it is. Like death. ( # Flute-led folk tune ) What is that music? Gypsies. They play well. Listen. l'm listening to you. No, don't touch me or look at me. l haven't the strength. Let me hold this minute, Alexis. Let me hope. - lf you love me. - lf l love you? Don't. Your life, everything that touches you. l will come to you tomorrow. ls that what you wish? Yes. Take care, Alexis. lt's all or nothing with me. l am not afraid. What are you looking at? These names on the glass, the names of lovers. Don't look at them. They pressed so hard. Are they afraid of forgetting? Shall l write our names, Alexis? Anna. Alexis. What's the other one? Guess. Lovers. Always. Always. ( # Fanfare ) (Men cheering) (Horses galloping) Oh, the brute! Lost again, Princess? - Prince Oblonsky! - (Chuckles ) Mm, afternoon, Betsy. How nice to see you in Petersburg, Stiva. - And Dolly? - Mm? Oh, in Moscow, minding the babies. Convenient. Who are you backing in the race? Well, Vronsky of course. Who else? - What's your fancy? - What a question to ask a woman. Can l guess the answer? - (Both laugh) - ( # Band playing) Oh, his royal highness. - Your brother-in-law is with him. - Mm, trust him. The Pope of St. Petersburg. Oughtn't you to be up there with him? Yes, l suppose l should. ( # Band continues ) (Music ends ) (Quiet chatter) Your imperial highness. Good day, Alexis. Hello, Stiva. - How's Dolly? - Never better. And Anna? Fine, fine, fine. lsn't she here? l sent the carriage on from the ministry. Er, will you excuse me? l tell you, these courses are butchery, Karenin. Nine jumps in a mile, and a hundred chances of breaking your neck. Anna has changed. Well, you've only to look at her. Ever since her return from Moscow. Lydia, l will not admit it. Anna Karenina is my friend. She's a delightful person. - Hmm, but she has changed. - A little, perhaps, but those without shadows shouldn't envy those who have. Envy? Am l envious? Oh! That pickled carp. Straight for the Tsar. He knows the way. - Treason. Mind your tongue. - What? Oh, l'm protected. Be careful, there are spies everywhere. For example... Ah, Betsy! You're my witness. Have l ever shown envy towards anyone? Why, only the other evening at the evening at the ball... Ah, Vronsky! Excuse me, ladies. Vronsky. l've come to wish you luck for the race. - l've come to witness your triumph. - Thanks, Stiva. - Well, how's the horse? - Nervous. l must get back to her. Well, when do we see you again? Tomorrow in the mess. Make my apologies for me, will you? Oh, yes, of course. - Madame. - Count Vronsky. - At last. - Careful. Monsieur l'Ambassadeur. l can't stand it any longer. When can l see you? Tonight at one. Come through the garden. He won't be there. There's Betsy Tverskoy. She's coming over. You're pale. Aren't you well?. l'm sick with lies. - Then come away with me. - l can't. What would become of... (Bell ringing) Tonight at one. l beg you, promise me. - l have made you unhappy. - l... l was dead before, now l'm alive. My love. Oh, my love. Dear one, there you are at last! (Quietly) Be careful, he's here. l couldn't bear it any longer with that collection of hags over there. Old samovar Lydia, always on the boil. And Liza Merkalov in a hat like a chimney pot! - (Bell ringing) - Saddling bell, Vronsky, come on, move. - Yes, all right. - (Betsy ) Bonne chance, Alexis. Not in public. There are other ways of doing it. Well, excellency, this is your wife. Don't you see her? My eyes were dazzled, Princess. Now, dear, you won't forget to have a word with his highness? - Very well. - And you have your binoculars? Good, good. Oh, will you excuse me? Come, Anna. ( # Band playing) Well, l've put my last rouble on Frou-Frou. Anna! You look resplendent. Oh, this wretched bustle. Now, where are they? - Well, not there. That's the finishing post. - Oh. Over there. Vronsky on Frou-Frou, and the rest of them. (Whinnying) Oh, my heart's thumping. My smelling salts! l know l shall need them. Oh, it's not as dangerous as it looks, you know. ( # Fanfare ) (Stiva ) They're off! (Crowd shouting, hooves thundering) First ditch was a six-foot fence at least! Come on, Vronsky! Vronsky! Frou-Frou! Bravo! He sailed over it like an angel! Taking risks of that sort - what's the point? ln officers' racing, your highness, it appears to me that danger is the chief attraction, admittedly superficial. (Crowd exclaiming) Well, there's your superficial with a couple of ribs broken. l wasn't referring to either saddle, your highness. - (Crowd shouting) - (Man ) Come on, Frou-Frou! (Woman ) Frou-Frou! Frou-Frou! Frou-Frou! lt's suicide! l never want to see another race again. l can't bear it. - Shall l take you home? - No, of course not. There goes another. Three! - Ah, Vronsky's falling back! - Yes, he's losing. - A bet? - Done! A pair of gloves! Gladiator! Frou-Frou! Oh, l beg your pardon. (Man ) Count Vronsky! - He's downi Vronsky's down! - Alexis! He failed the jumps, he did! Get an ambulance! Murder! Plain murder! The Tsar ought to stop this. - Stiva... Stiva! - He's gone to the course. - Anna, l'll take you home. - Stiva! - Anna, l am offering you my arm. - Leave me alone. Stiva, Prince Oblonsky! l think it's all right, he's not hurt. The horse is done for. - ( # Band playing) - (Crowd cheering) Get up, Anna. For the third time, l'm offering you my arm. Alexis, l promised Anna that l would drive her back. Thank you, Princess. My wife is not well, l shall take her home myself. Come, Anna. His imperial highness is waiting to speak to you. Anna. Smile. Bow. Smile. His imperial highness, Anna. Your imperial highness. Madame Karenina has had a bad shock. l don't wonder at it. lt's a cruel sport, madame. Pray accept my apologies. Anna. - Thank you, your highness. - l shall send to enquire after you. Anna... l beg you, conduct yourself in a more seemly manner in public. lt's not a matter of my personal feelings, but appearance, the respect l deserve. You are his mistress, aren't you? Yes. You dare to tell me this. (Footsteps ) Oh, not here, my dear baron, you will have to send a petition to my minister. l hate you, Alexis. Through your own sheen l don't even hear what you're saying. Only that he's alive. My lover is alive. That's everything. l shall go away. l shall leave your house. You may do as you please. But you will observe the proprieties to the end. Do you understand? To the end. (Clock chiming) (Knock on door) Come in. There is no need to knock every time you come in, Korney. Yes, your excellency. Korney? The stove. (Laughs ) You know, you probably think me rather stupid, but whenever l'm in Paris or Monte Carlo l miss this enormous contraption. (Chuckles ) (Clears throat) The Russian stove. l mean, when you think of it, it is Russia. (Sighs ) And as for this thing, you know, foreigners say we spoil our tea, but then they can hardly be expected to understand us, what? ls it so surprising when we can barely understand ourselves? Quite! Mm! My dear fellow, l quite forgot to congratulate you. l understand the Tsar has been gracious enough to award the Grand Cross of St. Alexander Nevsky to you. Oh, that. Yes. Thank you. Well, you're riding high, Alexis. And l have every reason to be pleased. You see, er... l want you to put a word in for me with the Tsar. - On what subject? - Well, l want a place on a committee. The lmperial Trans-Siberian Railway Consolidated Trust. (Laughs ) Yes, it's quite a mouthful, isn't it? But l thought it'd look terrific on my visiting card. l dare say. Why do you want this post? Well, my dear fellow, it carries a salary of 9,000 roubles! And to be frank, l'm hard up - deuced hard up. Then cut down on your expenditure. Anyway, it's a grossly inflated salary. Yes, probably, but it won't shatter the country's economy. Will you help? Yes, you have children. But don't overdo these requests, l shall be obliged to refuse you. Oh, don't worry, l'm very grateful to you. Well, that means Dolly will be able to take a holiday. Yes, she's been getting in quite a state. Oh, do you mind? That's not the only thing l came to talk to you about. There is one other matter. l expect you can guess what it is. lt... lt's Anna. l do not understand your mentioning this...person. Alexis... l can't always talk to you as if you were a statesman. Take pity on her. Pity? Why? She is a lucky woman. Well, you know how hard it is for her to be separated from her son. The choice was hers. Had she led a decent life... Yes, l know how you feel, but... Well, it is six months. When all's said and done, the past is over. For me it is still the present. l know, but... Well, forgive me, Alexis. She is my sister, and her position is... l am not interested in her position. You, er... You know they were in Venice? l am not interested. l take it she sent you to me. Well, yes. To be frank with you, she doesn't dare to come and talk to you. (Chuckles ) She does not dare? She has broken up my home, she has shaken my position, and... and she does not dare! Well, anyway, they've come back... to St. Petersburg. - Together? - Yes. She begs you to allow her to see Sergei. Oh, she's a true woman, Alexis, let her keep what she has. l am doing so. She has Colonel Vronsky. Well, ex-colonel. He's resigned his commission. That is his affair. Will you let Anna see Sergei? No. l told her as much. - She wrote to me. - She wrote to you? To be precise, she wrote to Countess Lydia. What? That old samovar? She must have been desperate. The Countess Lydia is a woman of rare quality. She fully supports me in this predicament. Ha! She would. Besides, l have told Sergei his mother is dead. Alexis! He prays for her. lt's better so. l've made up my mind. Do you mean Lydia's made up your mind? l resent interference, Prince Oblonsky. Well, l can't believe it. A mother... A lost woman. Dead. She forfeited her rights as a mother. But, Alexis, if you ever had any love for her, you wouldn't... How dare you use such a word to me? Go to your casino girls, teach them about love! Do you think l have no heart, that my career has blinded me, that all l care about is another cross to pin onto my chest? Do you think l have not suffered? My nights are torment. l can bear nobody anymore. Not even my son. That... That woman! l have done my duty to her. And more than my duty. Ha! But for her l am a machine. She told me so. Look at her. Her mouth... her body... it all reeks of... of passion, of inordinate desires. Even the scent... the scent she...she wore. lt's bad for me to talk like this. Well, l... l have talked to you. l promised. Ah, well. Family life always leads you into fun of this sort. There... There is one other thing, Alexis, if you don't mind. Vronsky's rich, we all know, but if he doesn't marry her, one day she'll be left high and dry, that's certain. Oh, she doesn't know it, of course. Divorce to her is the only way of seeing her son. And she is my sister. l must think of her future. l even thought of a... a duel. A duel. Divorce. No, l abominate divorce. The vulgarity. The scandal. Oh, Alexis, Alexis, be generous. l am a Christian, a son of the Church. No. l refuse a divorce. Anna will never see her son again. That's my last word. All right. l will tell her what you said. That is your concern. But why, Alexis? Why? They are happy. ( # Lively folk music) (Laughter and chatter) You should have been there, Vronsky. lt was wonderful. Serpukhovskoy, good luck. - Ah, prosit! - (Anna ) Salute. Ah-ha, that's Venice. And what else did the regiment get up to that night? Then...the Lieutenant General suddenly leapt up onto the table and started to dance the gopak! (Laughs ) l can just see himii The boys were singing their heads off! # Has anyone seen my love go by? (Both) # Did she forget or did she die? # - Flat again! - As usual. - Where are you off to, Anna? - Call me. - l, erm...l hope l haven't... - Oh, no, no, no. - A real woman, that. - lsn't she? l have no regrets. - So you guessed why l came. - Yes, and to hell with you. Have some more champagne. lt's good to see you anyway. My true respects. And a general too. (Chuckles ) You could have had yours for the asking. Smoke? Thank you. l thought about it once, you know. And now? No. No. Pity. Venice, how was it? Oh, beautiful. Very beautiful. Rather boring too. Of course, Anna adored it all, the painting side it, all that old stuff. - Did you see any Russians? - Good Lord, no. We didn't run away from here to meet them all again in Italy. No, not a soul. Well, now we're back again l expect we'll entertain at my place in the country, not Petersburg. Yes, don't be too sure of that, dear boy. You know these snobs. They'll make you wait. Think so? Well, we'll make do with each other. l'm content. Of course. Madame Karenina... - You've got the divorce, l mean. - Ahi lt's only a matter of days. Splendid. Then l am too late. - For what? - You know quite well. - For my resignation. - lt's a pity. Man, you could have waited, laid low for a while. You know what the army's like. All they ask is a little, erm, pliancy. Say yes and wait. But l am not...pliant. Oh, nothing personal, Serpukhovskoy. Why not? l'm pliant... as a dancing master. l promise you l stiffen up when it comes to the point. - You're wise. - So can you be. lt can't last. Come, listen. You must hear me out. l think Madame Karenina is charming, yes, absolutely, a rare woman, - but there's... - But what? We've always been friends, dear boy. - You had a magnificent career. - And now l haven't. So? You could take it up again tomorrow. Only, be honest... it's forever, you and she? (Laughs ) The questions the man asks. Yes! l hope so. What are you trying to say? l love Anna. Quite. And if you can marry, well and good. You see? l yield. Marry, you can take up your career again, go higher than me. - Serpukhovskoy... - You know it's true. - But if Karenin refuses... - l have told you he won't. But supposing he does. Then we'll go and live in the country. l'll be content. And you'll have plenty to do. Oh, yes, plenty. Counting your acres in the middle of the steppes. - You'll be bored, Vronsky. - Bored? What nonsense! One accepts. You're not forced to. - You have never been in love. - The Lord be thanked. l've seen what it does to an officer's career. Remember Mazankov? He ran off with a tart. l could wish you had. But think about it. A woman of the highest character in society, you snatched her from where she belongs. Women are materialists, Vronsky, terre--terre. Once you've taken them on, it's... Are you offended? No. But you're wrong about Anna. l have nothing more to say. l have an infinite respect for Madame Karenina, but it's you l love. l'm sorry, l'm due at the opera, l must be off. - lf you ever need any... - Oh, l know, l know. Anna! Anna? Oh, you're going. You must come again. With the utmost pleasure. (Vronsky ) l'll walk you to the door. Oh, please don't trouble. Oh, l insist. - Do you love me? Say you love me. - Anna! - What are you afraid of? - Of you, of you! Now, when will you learn you're my life, my... - Yes... - Anna, l adore you. Serpukhovskoy! - Annushka, did they have everything? - Yes, my lady. Put them on the carpet. l love unwrapping them myself. ls this the piano? You don't think he's too old? l promised him one for his birthday. That must be the train. - The porter gave me a letter for you. - Oh, put it on the table. (Plays scales ) - What do you think of that? - lt's a living miracle! l made a toy once for my little boy. lt was a sledge out of a wooden shoe. l didn't know you had a little boy, Annushka. Where is he? He's dead. l put the sledge in his coffin so that he could go to heaven in it. Oh, Annushka. Anna! Serpukhovskoy thinks you're wonderful. He's coming to supper tomorrow. He won't give the divorce. Well, that's that, then. We'll do without it. - Sergei, l must see Sergei. - You will. You must be patient. just wait. - When will l see him? - Soon. He can't be vindictive forever. l'll do something. You're trembling. Look at me, Anna. l'm here. Think of me. l'm your child too. Yes. How strange... that two people can love each other with such a chasm in between. - Anna. - You on one side and l on the other. What have we in common? You were bored in Venice, utterly, admit it. While l only consented to come back because of Sergei, you didn't give him a thought. That's unfair. Are you reproaching me because l only think of you? - l'm not reproaching you. - You always put him before me. Why not admit it? Alexis, how can you? Anna, l'm sorry. lf you love me as l love you... l can't go on being torn and divided between you. You're both my happiness. Without you both there's nothing. Well, you are all l need. But you haven't a child. No. - You bought some things for him, l see. - Yes. Oh, l do love you. When you go out, l hold the clothes you've been wearing, l'm afraid you won't come back. You used to laugh when we were in Venice. You weren't always thinking about Sergei then. Hmm? No. Alexis... this is the first time we've hurt each other. l don't think it'll be the last. l get on your nerves. Why don't you leave me? Don't be foolish, Anna, it's unworthy of you. We're both fools, we adore each other, for God's sakes, no doubts. Answer me. Oh, l love you, that's all l know. lt's like a fire when you say things like that. l can't bear anything in between us, not even your child. l know it's vile of me. Sometimes l think if you died... Oh, you're my life. Your body, your mouth, your warmth... You talk about dying. How long will you love me, Alexis? Always, Anna. - And you? - l? Always! Give me a cigarette. l'll laugh again tomorrow. l will see Sergei, it's his birthday, l'll go in the early morning. - But you can't, you know you can't. - We shall see. Karenin's certain to have given orders. Wait a few days. Wait? Wait? Do you suppose l am capable of waiting? Well, at least consult your lawyers first. l'd much rather you didn't interfere. Well... Well, l could go tonight. Karenin may be out, or asleep. What does it matter? l'd like to go out. As you wish. - Where? - To the opera. Patti's singing. lt'll be booked out, it's a premiere, the whole of Petersburg will be there. You mean l'm not good enough to appear at the premiere. Don't be so sensitive. My mother'll be there, all the officers. l have to shut myself up, avoid all my friends because l'm your mistress. - Am l an outcast? - Oh, be sensible. lt would be foolish to do this, to expose yourself to insult. Later, when we are married, we can go together. l am proud to be your mistress. You can be ashamed of it if you like. l shall go to the opera. l love you and l forbid it. You forbid? - What right have you to forbid me anything? - Anna! (Door slams ) - Excellency? - Why isn't the table cleared? Your excellencies were talking, so l didn't think to clear. - Leave that! That's the waiter's job. - Yes, excellency. And get my clothes out. l'm going to the casino. - And tell her ladyship. - Yes, excellency. Damn and blast! ( # Opera music) (Music ends, applause ) (Audience cheering) And there she is, in the loge at the right, parading herself! - l saw you wave to her! - Why not? She's a friend. Oh, really, Manya. Really, l don't understand you. How you can... Who are you bowing to, old boy? - Countess Vronsky over there. - What? The old witch. Careful. We're among the ranks of the angels. There's Princess Tverskoy, and her long-suffering husband. Oh, dear, we might be in heaven already. - Let's go backstage. - Lily's not singing tonight. - l don't believe it. - She is. Anna is here. - But she wouldn't dare. - You don't know her. But you do, Betsy. l mean, l thought you and she were friends. Oh, yes, but once. You know how it is - as soon as it happened, l had to close my door to her. - Betsy! - Dear man, don't you interfere. There are some things only women understand. Evidently. Take my card to Madame Patti. Princess. Karenina is here. - What did she say, old boy? - Madame Karenina is here. What? Are they back in Petersburg, then? Yes, l met them in the Morksaya yesterday. But the Princess can't be right. This is a premiere, she wouldn't dare. l dare anything with women. She'll be on Vronsky's arm, she'll be safe enough. Alone, by gad. Here's a story. Ah, Vronsky. Good evening, Prince. How are you? - Enjoying the opera? - Yes, indeed. And now he's here! Really, it's too much! Oh, and he seems to know nearly everybody. Perhaps that's why he's come - to show he doesn't care. To show how much he despises us. Come, Manya, we'll cut him. Good evening, Prince. Vronsky. Vronskyi l didn't expect to see you here tonight, my dear friend. No? Why not? - Well, that is, you didn't mention it. - Patti's in marvelous voice. l hope Madame Karenina's enjoying the performance. l believe so, Yashvin. Thank you. You should have been here for the first act. She's like a nightingale tonight. Are you looking for someone, Vronsky? No. Mind you, l know as much about opera as the man in the moon. The military band is more in my line. All those arias and coloraturas... But l tell you, Vronsky, when Patti opens her mouth... What? Oh. Anna! Andrey, l'd like my cloak. One hardly knows where to turn this evening. Betsy, that was quite unnecessary. Oh, there you are. What a pity you came late, you missed the best part. l'm not much of a judge. Shall we...get some air? Yes. l find Patti just a little overwhelming. Anna. Why did you do this to me? Why did you make me come? We'll talk about this outside. He's cooked, old boy. This time he's done for good. Your places, please, ladies and gentlemen. - The second act is about to start. - (Orchestra warming up) Your places, please, ladies and gentlemen. Your places, please. My little Sergei. My sweetheart, my darling, my little one. Your excellency! Pardon, milady, l didn't see you come. - Shh! How is he? - He's very well, but, er... l've been given orders, excellency, that... - l'll wait in the corridor. - Thank you, Korney. Mummy, is it you? ls it you, Mummy? My darling, yes, it's me. l knew you weren't dead. l knew you weren't. You'll catch cold, my treasure. You used to come and say ''Sergei'' in the night. l knew you did. You smell just the same. - Why are you crying? - Because l'm so happy. How you've grown. You're not unhappy, are you? Tell me, darling, you must tell me. No. Have you brought me any presents? - Oh, the presents, they're in the carriage. - What are they? Well, there's a train that goes and there's a piano and a music box and... Korney will fetch them. l like Korney. He plays with me. He never said you were dead. lt was the old lady, silly old thing. Oh, my darling, how thin you are. Do you eat enough? And how do you dress yourself without me? Oh, l'm strong now. Papa gave me a sledge, and Nana and l went on the ice in the garden. She always falls off. - Shall l show you my sledge? - Presently. lt's only me, your old Nana. Oh, God be praised! l knew you wouldn't forget the little gentleman's birthday. How could l forget, Nana? Oh, get up off the floor, dear. You'll hurt your knees. Yes, it's nine years since l put him into your arms - and broke a little cake over his head. - (He laughs ) What a winter! There were fir trees with colored lights all down the Neva. - (He laughs ) - Quiet, my little dove, you'll wake your father. He sleeps so badly. You'll have to go soon, my lady. Oh, l can't. l've barely touched him, barely kissed him. No, it's impossible. - What's the matter, Mummy? - (Sobbing) Nothing, my darling. My darling, my treasure. - l'll pray for you, my lady. - Yes, pray, pray. My Sergei, you won't ever forget me, will you? - Oh, no, Mummy. - You see, my darling, l might perhaps have to go away somewhere again. - No! - Yes. Oh, l shall be so unhappy if l have to, so l want you to say to yourself that l am thinking of you all the time and that nothing can ever separate us, nothing, nothing. My lady. l must be going. Don't be afraid. He won't come. What are you saying, my darling? l'm not afraid. Your father is good. When you're bigger you'll understand. He's better than l am. Nobody's better than you. Nobody! Mummy, l don't want you to go away. l don't want you to go away! But l'm not going away, my darling. Then take off your cloak, Mummy. There, you see? l'm not going away. You are pretty, Mummy. Have you been to a ball?. Mm-hm. A grand ball with lights. Now my Sergei is going to sleep. lt's so late. Sit on the bed. There. Happy now? Yes. l want to hold your hand, and then you won't be able to get away. Mummy, are you there? Yes, my darling. Go to sleep, go to sleep. Tell me like you used to, about Babinka. Babinka the cat and Mashka the mouse, they had a fine wedding in a fine house. And then they ate up all the sugar before the witch came. Goodbye, my darling. My treasure. My cloak, Nana. - (Nana sobbing) - Don't cry, don't wake him. Tell him l... No. l leave him in your charge. lf he ever falls ill, send for the doctor at once and let me know. l beg you, let me know. Goodbye, Nana. Kiss him for me, every day. Every day. Korney, see madame out. (Birdsong) Please will your ladyship wait here? Her ladyship's been sent for. She's out riding. The master's in the fields. Oh. Can l bring you something? Thank you. (Anna ) Dolly! - Anna. - Oh! - l've spoilt your ride. - Oh, l'm so happy to see you here. You must be exhausted after your journey. Tania, bring us something to drink. Oh, you must be so thirsty. Sit down, take your hat off. Never mind that. All l want is to sit and have a good look at you. You're so beautiful. Have l changed? You look as though you're in your right place. So commanding. Yes. That's the way to treat life. Crack the whip. - And Stiva and the children? - They're very well. And Vronsky, Anna? Very well too. Why shouldn't he be? Everything you saw on your way here is his. He hunts, he builds hospitals, he talks to the peasants. He has everything. l have only him, nothing else. But you still love each other? Oh, that's the terrible thing, loving. lt is hot, isn't it? - Will you spend the winter here? - Hmm? - Yes, l expect so. - But you'll have friends. Oh, yes, we have friends... of a sort. (Chuckles ) ln St. Petersburg l went to the opera one night. One of my oldest friends cut me. No, we'll be alone, l expect. Anna...won't there be any children? No. That shocks you, Dolly? There are ways, you know. Besides, one doesn't keep a man with children. - l know. - l've got... l've had Sergei, there won't be any others. - How is he, Dolly? Have you seen him? - Stiva has. Anna... Oh, Stiva has seen him and you didn't tell me. How is he? - Tell me about him. - He's quite well, don't worry. He's a big boy now. Stiva's seen him! Well, did he talk about me? Tell me. He's, erm, rather reserved. l know he thinks about you. He was unhappy after you came to see him. Oh, Anna, l'm so sorry. Leave it to me, Tania. l'm teaching Tania to read, and in return she tells me old stories and legends. - lsn't that so? - Yes, my lady. ln the winter she does weaving on a grand scale with the other girls, and boys too. She sings. They know what happiness is. A white hen and a black hen, that's love, and death. Death? Why death? When love is gone... Run along, Tania, hm? - Lemonade, Dolly? - Thank you. Dolly, tell me about Kitty. Oh, Kitty. She's married, Anna. - And happy? - Yes. Konstantin Dmitrich Levin. He loves her. He's as good as can be. As good as can be. l'm so glad. Oh, Dolly, it's such a joy for me to see you here. Listen, Anna, l've brought some news. Write to your husband and he will let you have the divorce. - You've asked him again? - Stiva and I. - l can't write to him. - Only a letter. He's thought it over. He's religious, you know. Yes, he's perfect. What for, Dolly, hm? What more would it give me if l humbled myself? Tell me. You could marry. You could be Vronsky's wife. l am his wife. Yes. You mean, then l'd be sure of keeping him. Not only that. Would it give me back my son? No. Then why should l? l am certain Vronsky wants the divorce. Are you? Are you sure? l'm not. Anna... he hasn't changed? No. No, he's the man he's always been. But we have a special attitude to love, Dolly. lt's our occupation, we live on it. Other people have their careers, their friends. We have love, nothing else. To live and breathe and think for one person... Oh, we're mad. Anna, what's going on? You're not telling me the truth. He's not... Unfaithful?. No, not yet. There are many ways of being unfaithful with all this - his books, his hunting, his land. A man can deceive you when he's sitting beside you in his armchair reading a newspaper. He deceives me every time he's not thinking of me. Of me. Anna, you can't be so unreasonable. - You must give him some freedom. - Freedom? Am l free? Men need it more. They need more independence. You'll only break yourself trying. All right, then, l'll break myself. l've sacrificed everything - my son, my... Let him do the same. The loneliness, Dolly. Do you know that there are times when l hate him and he hates me? Two lovers, dying together minute by minute in a hell of our own making. There must be an end. Do you believe in icons, Dolly? There are some people who send for the Virgin of Kazan or somewhere to bless the house and bring back love. We must believe in God, not images. ln God? Oh, he's a long way away. Only to make our thoughts seem smaller. ( # Choir singing) (Priest and server calling and responding) Give me back my son. Give me back Alexis. - Give me back my son. My son. - (Priest and server call and respond) And Alexis. My son and Alexis. (Priest) Have mercy upon man. (Server) Have mercy upon man. Give me back my son. Give me back Alexis. (Priest) Have mercy upon man. (Server) Have mercy upon man. - Reading? - Mm, the Moscow news. Do you want it? Serpukhovskoy has been awarded another medal - the Cross of St. George this time. There's the snow. The pigeons are wheeling. - Have you been down to the lake? - Mm, this morning. Soon be able to skate. You're smoking too much, Anna. Oh, am l? What would you like me to do, hm? - Are you going out tonight? - Probably. - Where to, may l ask? - To Moscow, to see my mother. Again? Why again? l haven't seen her for three weeks. Money matters, l have to settle with her. Nothing else? Please. Don't expect me to bury myself here all winter without once in a while attending to my business affairs. And enjoying yourself on the side. Well, why not? All right. l'll come with you. - By all means. You have the right. - The right? Look, Anna, what's the matter? Are you suggesting that just because l have to go out from time to time... l live alone, with no one to talk to. You don't even think of me. Do l go to see women? A visit to my mother, supper with Makhotin. l suppose even a married man could allow himself that. Mm, quite. And you're not, you're my lover. Love - we always get back to love. What else have l got in this world? - Do l even have that? - Haven't l given you proof? What more do you want? Words, protestation? Go on. Actions. Anything else? No, Anna. Let it end there. Yes. You can hardly wait for it to end. An end to all these scenes, l agree with you. We've got into the habit of them unfortunately. We ask too much of life. We like to think we are exceptional. All people in love do the same. All people in adultery, you mean, don't you? Nothing could be commonplace, more dreary. All my women friends had lovers but they stuck with their husbands. They were respectable. Well, l didn't play their game and now l am paying for it. - l made sacrifices too. - Oh, yes, l know, you've told me often enough. - When? When have l ever said... - You? (Chuckles ) Well, you cry it aloud all the time. Your career, your position, your friends, the fine future you'd have had without me, without this woman business. l'm the millstone around your neck, l'm preventing you from living, isn't that it? Well, isn't it? What's at the bottom of all this? Your sense of being in a false position. But you refuse to write to your husband. Why reproach me for not asking for a divorce? You don't want it. Well, what, then? What else am l talking about when l say l want a normal life? A home with children, a bit of peace! Well, perhaps your mother can give that to you. My mother? She's trying to supply your needs, isn't she, with Princess Sorokina? Princess Sorokina? Oh, you don't know her? Of course l do. Why shouldn't l know my friend's sister? - Very young and pretty, l believe. - What are you suggesting? - That l'm running after her? - That you see her at your mother's, that she's throwing her into your arms and wants you to marry her. Anna, you're impossibly jealous. l can't go near another woman without your suspecting me and inventing l don't know what. To keep you happy l'd have to shut myself up here with you, cut myself off from everything else l care about, leaving myself empty but yours. Well, no, thank you! l'm sorry, Anna. l will unto myself. l have tastes and a personality of my own and that's that. l was right. You don't love me. Oh, can't you understand that l can love you and still see the sky and the world around you? You're my sky and my world. lf you loved me, l'd think myself happy if l were blind. You're a woman. For you, that's possible. But a man needs the whole of life. - All of it. - Then take it. - Oh, don't worry, you'll be rid of me. - Oh, now you're threatening. lt's a threat to no one but me. l want to be loved, l no longer am. - l'm putting it on record, that's all. - l love you! lf you were in your right mind, you wouldn't doubt it. - But l must be free. - You are free. Go. l shall be gone two days only. Less. l must have this power of attorney from my mother, and she's expecting me, and you know it. Give me your hand. lf you go away tonight, you'll never see me again. - What? - Never. Now look, Anna, l've put up with enough of your nonsense. l'm going to Moscow tonight. - Go to Moscow! - And you'll be here when l get back! No! All right. Alexis, don't go! l don't know what l've been saying. Don't you see how l'm suffering, how terrible it is for me? l've nothing left! Let go of me. Sergei, my little one, l can't tear him from me, can l? He's living inside me always. His voice, oh, his voice. l can't stand it any longer. And l only go on living because you are here. You! You! My only hope is to have you both, to love you together, but that's not possible. He's growing up without me, he's forgetting me. l have only you, you! Please, get up, Anna. - No. - This is madness. Please get up. No. Let me hold you. l love holding you. Anna, what is it you want? l'll do anything for the sake of your peace of mind... Don't go away, then! lf you only knew what my nights are like when you're not here. l take drugs, it's such a relief to forget, to feel nothing. Now be sensible. Tomorrow... - Today, Alexis. - l must go, Anna. l promised. - But you promised to make me happy. - l have to go. This is for you as well. We need this money. l don't want the money. Now, don't be childish. - Well, you can wait a day. - l can't. My mother's going to the country tomorrow. With Princess Sorokina. - l don't know. That's my mother's concern. - Yes, it is. She's cruel and heartless. - She knows that if you left me... - Please don't speak that way about my mother. Well, you've said worse things. That's my affair. So this is how you prove your love? Damn it! You won't understand if you won't give in! lt's this woman or me, you must choose! (Whispering) This is intolerable. l shall return tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. - Alexis! - (Vronsky ) Misha! My greatcoat! - Are the horses ready? - All ready, excellency. Your fur cap and gloves, excellency. (Vronsky ) Tell her ladyship... - Nothing. You can go now. - Thank you. Your excellency? Misha, take this note to his lordship. But he has gone, excellency, to the station. Take a horse. Catch up with him. You must! - Give him this. - Shall l wait for an answer? There's no answer. He'll come back with you. Go on, runi Annushka, l need to do my hair, my face, he mustn't find me like this. l must look happy for him. Bring me a comb and my powder, quickly. And a dress, the mauve! Make him come back. Make him come back. I'll believe everything. l won't ask for anything more. What time is it? Five o'clock, excellency. Such a terrible day, so wet and cold. You haven't brought the dress and shoes! My shoes! Five minutes. He'll be getting to the station. Now he's getting his ticket. He's reading it. The train isn't signaled. Pray God it's late. Pray God. Misha, Misha. - Misha! What...? - (Panting) Excellency. A letter from her ladyship, excellency. She sent me after you on the horse. Oh, the snow! You can't see! lt's a mercy of God l kept on the road. Shall l get the coachman to turn round the barouche, excellency? (Train approaching) Clumsy Annushka, hurry. His lordship will be here. All this misery for a man. There's no sense in it. - (Bells jangling) - The carriage! Quickly, go and see. (lndistinct chatter) The coachman says he saw Misha talking to his lordship, but... as nobody gave him any orders he came straight back. - My lady... - lt's nothing. My coat and muff. l have to go out. Excellency, you'll lose yourself in the dark and the snow. And suppose his lordship doesn't find you at home? - Wait a little while. - Wait? What for? He won't come back. Where will you go? To the station. Where should l go? Alexis... Colonel Vronsky is taking me to Moscow. - l'll come with you. l'll tell the coachman. - No, wait here. Kiss me. No. - Goodbye, Annushka. - Goodbye... Silly of me, l meant...l must go out. l shall go across the fields. Don't be anxious, the air will do me good. Feel, l'm burning. Get my coat, Annushka. Oh, yes. That's everything. Excellency! - l was waiting for the snow to stop. - You saw his lordship, gave him the letter? - Yes. - And? There was nothing, excellency. Nothing? - You can go. - Very well, excellency.
