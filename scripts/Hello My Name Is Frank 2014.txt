Man: Apply pressure to his shoulder. Hold on, frank! Man: ( Narrating ) Well, this is ironic. What an asshole I've been. Used a disability to hide from the world. Look at me. Gasping for my life. When, during all of my 59 years, I was already in a box just waiting to die. Maybe if I'd just... ( Sighs ) Here you come along I take a breath and remind myself that I, too, can be strong thought I was cool turns out I'm a fool clearly you've proved me wrong I didn't know what I was missing when I was alone and now I'm fruitlessly waiting for someone not thinking before they start rushing to my door someone to run not walk oh, someone to sing not talk oh, no hesitation at all sometimes I need you to be the one to call well, I'm lost in my thoughts they tumble ahead over and over again yeah, it's true just take a look at what's been done to me ( vocalizing ) Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. Well, you can't stay here. This is no kind of home for a teenage girl. You need to be with a proper family. Frank is not your responsibility. I appreciate your help, but we'll be just fine. What we're trying to say is we want you to come live with us, don't we dear? ( Clears throat ) We... we'll... Well, we want to take care of you, pay for your college, buy you a car, give you some fun money. You wouldn't have to worry about work or bills. You could be young and carefree for once. Your mama and I were very close. We went to the same church, lived on the same block. We did everything together. I just want to make sure you're taken care of. You don't have to worry about me. - Really. - Well, you've been taking care of others for too long. First your mama when she was sick and now frank. Hello, we haven't met. No. I'm Louise. I'm Cathy's cousin. And this is my husband, Doyle. Bitch! ( Clears throat ) You must be frank. Cathy and I have talked a lot about you the last couple of months and about Laura. I was just talking to Laura about her future. Shut up, bitch. - It's just a tick. - Sorry. Laura's gonna be all taken care of. I see. And what about you, frank? Do you have somebody new to take care of you? - Ah, no. - Yes. I... I don't need a... a new caretaker. I'm finding him a new caretaker very soon. I just hope you're not expecting Laura to take care of you? Oh, no one needs to worry about. Laura's future or... or mine. Stupid bitch! Ugh, sorry. Look, um... I appreciate your offer, but I can take care of things myself. - ( Clanging ) - Frank: ( Screams ) Son of a bitch! ( Screaming continues ) And what about college? I'll have him settled before I go. Uh-huh. Doyle, honey, could you get me some more wine? - Of course. - Quite a bit of it. All right. ( Mixed chatter ) Yeah! - Frank! - Yeah! You will stop it now. - ( Kids laughing ) - ( Door slams shut ) Oh... ( Yells out ) ( Grunting ) Slow down. I didn't bake that many. Why? Chocolate makes everything better. Yeah, it's chocolate all right. - Hmm. - Will you quit eating them? I made them for Laura. I shouldn't feel better, though, should I? I mean, Laura's mom is dead. - Hey. - Oh, my god. Laura, I'm so sorry. Oh, my god. I just said "oh, my god." Oh, my god. I can't stop swearing. - What's the matter with me? - You're high. - Calm down. - ( Laura laughs ) What? There's pot in the brownies. - Oh, my god. - ( Giggles ) You okay? Hey, we can always postpone the trip. - Until you're ready. - Yeah, Laura, Stacy would totally understand. No, I promised my mom I would go. I know. We can celebrate Stacy's 18th birthday here. Yeah, that sounds cool. We can go to all the places that she liked the best. We can do all of her favorite things. No, I promised my mom I would go on this trip. She really thought it would be good for frank and, I don't know, force him to take care of himself or something. And we all promised Stacy. Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. ( Both laughing ) It's yours. I... I want you to have it. - I can't take this. - No, I want you... you... - You take it. - No, frank, I can't... - No, frank. - I want... - Hey. - ( Grunts ) How does the pot get inside the brownies? - Frank. - Bitch! - ( Barks ) - Frank? - Me back. - ( Bat clanks ) Oh. Frank was trying to give me his Mickey mantle bat. Really, frank? Why would you do that? Who knows what kind of crazy caretaker you're gonna line up? I don't want my bat stolen and sold for coke money! ( Barks ) Well, I promise not to hire a cokehead. Besides, Meth's the drug of choice these days. Why were you trying to give me your bat, frank? Ray, I told you I want you to have it. ( Sighs ) Well then, I guess I will take the bat. No, when the time comes. If your time comes before mine. It'd be a lot easier if you take it now. Why now? I mean, are you really afraid that someone will steal it? ( Music playing ) I know what you want and I know what you need this can't be happening to us but I'll help you try to fill everyone's empty pail if everything's second best to none where hope is a lot like a rope you're tangled before you let go I ripped up the canvas that painted our sadness I know you're my friend not my foe whoa, ho Damn it, frank! ( sobbing ) No! And hope is a lot like a rope you're tangled before you get choked I ripped up the canvas that painted our sadness I know you're my friend not my foe, whoa nope. ( sobbing ) ( Yells out ) Ah, fucker! Ah, fuck. Laura: I got it. I... I can do this. You don't have to worry about me. Your... your mother didn't always take care of me, you know? Hell, there was that time when I took care of both of you. Oh, so I've heard. ( Slurps, spits ) Bitch! Ow! Ow! We're gonna get you someone good, frank. You're just like your mother. You worry too much. Good night, frank. ( TV playing ) Hi, I was calling to setup an interview for the caretaker position you applied for. ( Snorts ) I'm gonna need the television every night between primetime and 2:00 A.M. I run a very successful recap blog. You remind me of my late husband. I don't cook or clean. Just care take. Dude, we are gonna kill it when we hang out at the skate park. - Dude. - Dude! Yeah, this could really work out. But just so you know, I don't clean or do laundry with store bought chemicals. - I'm allergic. - Fuck you! Whew! Oh... ( Chuckles ) ( Laughs ) It's lavender. It'll calm him down. Can I get paid in advance? Yeah, and can I borrow your car, too? You have to talk to her about the car. I can't drive. - Thank you for your time. - Ah. ( Thick accent ) A rose and, uh... Have you ever been on a cruise? No, no. Yeah, this sounds great, but I have to ask. Are there any elementary schools within a quarter of a mile? Do... do you have a problem with little kids? No, I love children. Dude, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna strap some skates to your ass and we're gonna fly you down the ramp. Dude, everybody's gonna love you. - You gonna strape... - strap. - Strap? - Yes. - Skates to my ass? - Yeah. - Yeah. - It's gonna be awesome. - No. - Awesome. I make a pupusas, too. Pupusas. When can you start? - Oh. - ( Laughs ) Okay, yes, I guess. Lastly, here is our lovely kitchen. - Oh. - Hmm. Frank doesn't cook, so you'll have to do that. And it's best that you cook him things that do not splat or squirt or slurp. Eh, excuse me, splatter, eh, squirt? With his ticks it's just a lot easier to clean up, so you can stick to stuff like burgers, sandwiches, that sort of thing. - Yes, yes, that's okay. - ( Sighs ) - Okay, great, great. - ( Sighs ) Lemme give you my number and if anything comes up, - you can... - ( Grunts ) Frank. Frank, what the hell are you doing? What's it look like I'm doin'? Ah. - Oh, bitch, hah. - Okay, lemme... Let me show you to your room over here. I think you'll really like it. Come on. ( Snoring softly ) ( Dramatic score ) ( Snoring continues ) ( Floor boards creak ) ( Thump ) - ( Yelling ) - ( Screaming ) I see you! Rapist! Rapist! Rapist! ( Barking ) ( Yelling in Spanish ) What? I guess you forgot to tell her I sleepwalk. With a, with a baseball bat? ( Exhales ) - Hi. - Hi. I don't suppose you have hypoallergenic bedding, do you? - ( Laughs ) - Frank: Shut the fuck up, bitch. Oh, god! Oh, my god. - ( Cheering ) - ( Graduation theme playing ) Man: Kimberly Barbara Smith. - ( Music continues ) - ( Cheering continues ) Alisa Edith Kumato. ( Cheers, applause ) - Man: Laura Kelly Pareesi. - Oh, fuck! ( Cheering continues ) - Ugh! - Man: I'd like to congratulate - our graduating class... - I missed it. Oh, Laura. ( Grunting ) ( Band playing ) - Laura. - ( Laughs ) I missed it. I dropped the fucking binoculars. Well, I graduated. Thank you for coming. Male sportscaster: The Red Sox beat the tigers 6-5 in 10 innings. ( Sportscaster continues ) The final score was 1-0. Here are the games still in progress. Twins and mariners are at the top of the seventh... - What're you wearing? - Clothes. Rick said a gluten-free potluck. But you have the graduation party tonight. Ah, that fucker! What am I paying him for? I don't care about the party. I just wanna chill before I go on our trip tomorrow. Laura, you're going to that party. I can be alone for one night. Really? Laura. It's your graduation party. Go party. Live a little. Loser bitch! Ah, ah. Yeah, look who's talking. You gonna call your friends or am I? ( Music playing ) Chug, chug, chug, chug... ( Mixed chatter ) Promise me we don't stay out too late. I mean, we got to get up and go early in the morning. - I promise. - Okay. Mm, party. - Oh. - Oh. - Look at the happy couple. - Mm-hmm. - Shall we? - Mm. Oh, my god. I didn't think you were coming. - Frank made me. - Well, grab a drink, ladies. - It's time to celebrate. - I've got my punch, thanks. Mm, no. - Hey. - This is better. - ( Laughing ) - What is this? Who gives a fuck? - Here you go. - Thank you. - Hand it over. - What? - I'm not that bad. - ( Laughs ) Right. May we remind you of the watermelon cooler night? - Mm-hmm. - Let's go. - Let's go. - That never happened. Thank you. A toast... To no more fifth period, no more curfews, no more uniforms, and tomorrow we hit the road. Cheers. It's only one shot, so I don't want to see a drop. - Mm. - Race you. - Mm! - I gotta pee. - Oh, jeez. - ( Coughing ) - Wow, okay. - Oh, yeah. So, I'm surprised frank convinced you to come. - How did he do it? - Um... By being super annoying. He's been acting really strange since mom died. How're you doing? She was sick for nine months, at least she's not suffering anymore. I'm fine. Seriously, I'm... I'm totally fine. Those last couple weeks I just... I could not see her like that anymore. But I just... You know, I worry about frank. I mean, I'm all he's got. Well, he's a grown man, Laura. He'll deal. Yeah. I just don't know what he's thinking anymore. You know? Well, his caretaker is gone. - You're leaving for college... - Mm-hmm. And he has to adjust to living with some - stranger in his home. - Oh! I mean, he's probably just at the end of his rope. Ah, bitch! ( Barks ) Wait. What did you say? You know, he's probably just at the end of his rope. - Oh, shit. - Where are you going? Laura? ( Music playing ) - ( Yells out ) - ( Woman screaming ) What? - Ah. - Come on. - You sleepwalk now, too? - ( Gasps ) What? Late night? Guess I'll get breakfast. Why were you giving away your bat, frank? I... I told you already. My mom took care of you my whole life, and now suddenly you don't need a new caretaker? - Why? - ( Doorbell rings ) I told you. Ray... Where's frank? He sent me this cryptic email last night. - Where is he? - I wouldn't call it cryptic. What does it say? "Urgent. Please clean everything up before Laura comes home." Oh, oh, I... I meant to send that to my housekeeper. Housekeeper? I'm your housekeeper. So, I hired a new housekeeper. No, you didn't! Where's the rope, frank? What rope? I did hire a housekeeper. You're leaving. - What would you know? - ( Doorbell rings ) Don't you bother answering the door, frank. - I'm not going anywhere. - Shut up, bitch! Oh, hi frank, is Laura ready? - No. - Yes. I'm not going. I gotta stay with frank. What do you gotta stay here for? I got ray and... and the gay to take care of me. You know why. God, why did you take the rope, frank? Stupid, lying whore, fucking... Mm-mmm. The zipper on your suitcase is broken. You told me, right? Look at it. So, I put slipknots in the rope so I could... Eventually I'll tie that thing together so it'll stick together and you could take it. Satisfied? Bitch! I'm sorry, frank. I'm sorry, but I can't stay around - all of this negative energy. - What? What? No, no, no, no. Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick. No, you can't go. I'm supposed to leave this morning. - So, you are coming? - No, forget it. Nope. Rick, Rick, no, we'll pay you double. - My trip's only a few days. - Nope, no thank you. We'll pay you a months' salary just to stay till I get back. - Give me my stuff. - Come on! - ( Grunts ) - Rick! Donald trump couldn't pay me enough to take care of that lunatic! That's it. I can't go. I can't... You have to. I can't be trapped alone in a car for two days with Hannah Montana over there. She'll have me Kumbayaing before we're even out of the driveway. ( Sighs ) I can help, of course, but I can't manage a 24/7 watch. I'm sorry, you guys, I can't go. I cannot leave frank alone. You can go. I'll be fine. I... I... I'll call you every day until... Until the day that you don't call me? It's only for a couple of days. It'll be fine, right? Oh, please don't flake. You have promises to keep. Alisa, if Rick hadn't quit, maybe I'd consider it, but something is going on with frank. I can feel it. I can't leave him alone right now. Why don't we bring frank along? You mean frank? Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. Oh, my god, Laura. I don't know why I said that. I'm just really hungover. - And I... - Alisa: Fuck no! I'm not gonna be trapped in a car with a grown-ass man. We're supposed to have fun on this trip. Look, I lied to my parents about going on a church retreat this weekend. - So, we can't bail now. - No! No, this is a totally fucked up idea, Laura. You can't seriously be thinking about this. I don't know if I have much of a choice. Come on, it'll be fun. Hey, frank, wanna go on a road trip? ( Bass guitar strums, drum sticks tapping ) ( Barks ) ( Music playing ) Kim: Thanks for driving first, Laura. I'll take over when my head clears up a bit. No prob. Do you wanna sit up front, frank? There's more room up there. He can't sit next to the driver. Why not? Ow. - Sorry. - Laura: That's why. ( Music continues ) Been calling the shots of what you sold this picture been cold in the shadows... ( song changes ) No way. We are not listening to your Satan worshiping, air-drum thrashing insult to music. What? ( Changes song ) Anybody wanna play the license plate game? Punch bug? Alphabet game? Sisyphus? The movie game is a good one. Yellow car? ( Bell dings ) Do you want anything? - Laura? - Yeah. Why was Stacy buried so far from home? Well, her mom's family is from up there. So that is home. And it was your idea to take this trip? Well, we all made a promise to Stacy when she was dying. She kept saying how she'll never see her 18th birthday. And we were just sitting with her and all we could think to say was... We'll spend your 18th birthday with you. I don't think any of us actually believed it. What? No, nothing. It's just... I shoulda known this. You and I lived in the same house. Fucking idiot. Want anything? What the fuck, Kim? We're not even a hundred miles out of town yet. Why the hell didn't you tell us this piece of shit only got two miles to the gallon? Sorry. I usually just drive it around town. So, I didn't know. Holy shit. Is that Kevin bowman? What? The gas guy. Oh, my gosh. Remember him? He was like, a living legend in ninth grade. Senior quarterback. The most popular guy in high school. - Kevin bowman. - No, it can't be. I heard he moved to New York with, like, a model girlfriend - or something. - Well, apparently not. Remember Stacy had the total hots for him? Do you remember she saved that piece of gum - that he chewed for like a year? - Oh, yeah. And she made an altar for him with all of his pictures. Oh! Do you remember the one year that Laura gave her one of his jockstraps for her birthday? - Yeah. - She slept with that nasty thing. Gross. - What? What're you doing? - Don't worry your little head. My god, Alisa. Alisa, don't. ( Grunts ) Hey, frank. - Thanks. Oh! Oh! Oh! - Welcome. - Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! - Uh! Ah! - Here. I got it. - Fuck! I did it again! It's okay. It's... Looking for something? Oh, I'm looking for something all right. The question is... Do you have what I want? ( Door bell dings ) - Restroom? - Yeah. Fucking asshole. Fucking tick. - Yeah, you like that? - Yeah. - That's good. - Yeah. Oh, by the way, Stacy says hi. Whew! Wait! What the fuck? Hey! ( Laughs ) Oh! - Excuse me. - I'm sorry. What the fuck? Frank, let's go! Get in the car, frank! Kim? Let's go! Drive! Woo-whoo! Let's go! Drive! - What the? - Okay. - Hurry! - What? I'm driving. What the hell did you do, Alisa? Just getting Stacy her birthday gift. - You didn't. - Kevin bowman's football helmet! - Whoo! - Are you crazy? - He's gonna call the cops and get us arrested. - For what? This isn't "Thelma and Louise." I didn't rob a store. I just, you know, took a little memento. Still we could've gotten into a lot trouble, Alisa. I can't believe this. Yeah, if you want your own stupid thrills, do it on your own time. Don't rope us into it. You know what? Fuck you guys. Stacy would've totally been into this. You two need to learn to chill the fuck out and have a little fun. It'll do you both some good. Stupid. - Ugh! - Ow! - Sorry. - Frank! Ah, sorry. They're gaining on us. Kim: Nobody's gaining on us, frank. ( Sighs ) - I miss Stacy. - Ugh! Sorry. It was never quite the same after she died. Sure. You had loads of fun with Stacy. Like the time she locked you in the boys bathroom with Johnny Dale. Said you needed seven minutes in hell to make sure you really wanted to go to heaven. That wasn't really the time I was thinking about. And the time freshman year when she unzipped your skirt and your hello kitty underwear was showing all day. - That wasn't exactly when... - Or, no, no, no, no, no. The time she threw you in the pool. You were wearing that white dress. That was the first day I saw your tight wet, hot pink bra. So naughty. That doesn't sound like a very Christian color. Stop it, okay? My mom saw that. I got in big trouble over that bra. - Do you remember when she... - I hated Stacy! Maybe that's why you lied to your parents about going on a Christian retreat. So you could take the car, go to Stacy's grave. Make sure she was really dead. Why are you always so mean to me? I'm just saying it like it is. You guys, stop! - You know you're being a bitch. - Ooh, Kim just said bitch! You know, Jesus heard that. You better ask for forgiveness. - Oh... ah! - Ow! What the fuck? Are you trying to get us killed? Seriously, Laura? You need to choose who you want to be friends with because after this trip, I am done with her. Ooh, nice friends you got. - Can you get out of the car? - What? What, wha... wha... What're you doing? Wha... ah... Stupid mental bitch! ( Grunting ) Frank: What? ( Alisa yelling ) Laura! ( Music blaring ) ( Screaming ) Mother fucking psychos! Fuck! ( Music continues ) - ( Stuttering ) - Is she coming back? We're fine. We're fine. We're just stranded in the desert. She's coming back! ( Knocking on window ) Laura, you okay? Laura? - Laura? - Alisa: Laura. - You okay? - I think someone else should drive. Let's get in the car. Hey. Let's give him a ride. Are you mental? He could be a serial killer. Ah! I'm with Kim on this one. Besides, I don't do well with strangers. - Axe murderer! - Oh, come on. It'll be fun. Besides, isn't it the Christian thing to do? To help others in need? Ah, not if he chops us to pieces. ( Frank grunts ) Hey! Do you want a ride? Frank: Jeffrey Dahmer! Jeffrey Dahmer! ( Barks ) There is no way I'm letting him get in this car. What the fuck, Kim? He could be your future husband for all you know. Now, you'll never know. I am not meeting my future husband on the side of the road. Actually, that's how I met Laura's mom. - No, you didn't. - Sure did. Well, I met her at a bus stop. She was still a nurse at the time. ( Chuckles ) She was wearing this bubblegum pink cotton nurse's uniform. She had her hair up in a bun, and she had on these spotless white shoes. Ah, she looked like an angel. So, you hit on her? She sat next to me on the bus, and we got to talking and, well, that was after I hit her in the face. So, I guess in a way, I did hit on her. ( All laughing ) It was like god just put her at that bus stop. See, Kim? Sometimes it's good to step out of your comfort zone and live a little. Well, that was an exception. Haven't you ever heard of the expression "you play with fire, and you will get burned"? Haven't you heard the expression "you better use it before it gets old"? Whatever. "To each your own." Laura, ( Clears throat ) You're not hungry? I'm just curious, frank. Why do you always bite that key ring? Is it because of the tourettes? Oh, my god. Kim, is having tact anti-Christian or something? Frank doesn't mind. Do you? I just have never known anybody with tourettes, and I have a lot of questions. And Laura's never let us spend this much time with frank before. I... I'm worse around people. You mean your tourettes is? I mean, you aren't your tourettes, right? I read somewhere that it's like this evil twin that comes out when you least expect it. Like, you just can't control what it says or does. I can relate to that. I just think it's really cool that you can swear like a sailor and never get in trouble for it. ( Laughs ) Well, I... I wouldn't say never. Can I hear what you're like without the key ring just... Just once? He needs a trigger. Shut up, you little bitch. Fuck you, cocksucker. - Damn it! - ( Laura laughs ) Oh. God damn, fucking asshole, cocksucking, crazy bitch picnic... ( Barking ) Hey! That is no way to address teenage girls. You ought to be ashamed of yourself with that mouth. ( Frank grunts ) - ( Gasps ) You... - Laura: Whoa! Bitch picnic, bitch picnic, bitch picnic. Stop it right now! This is a public place with children present! Stop it! He can't help it! ( Yelling, barks ) Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were afflicted. But you really shouldn't be in a public place with kids present. And you need to learn how to pick on someone your own size. It was a mistake. Dickhead. Sorry. I have tourettes, too. Asshole. Sorry. Me, too. What she said. I have a right to protect my children from being exposed to profanity. I have that right. ( Sighs ) We'd better get the hell out of here. - ( Sighs ) - Oh, my god, that was like, the best lunch ever. - You were awesome, frank. - I was? - Totally. - ( Groans ) You had some really good digs at him. You gotta teach me some of your moves. ( Laughs ) I think... I think I just had my first fight. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Give me some five. - ( Chuckles ) - You shouldn't be afraid of a little danger now and then. Oh, I... I'm not thirsty. - Thanks. - No. No, it's for your eye. - Ah. - ( Alisa chuckles ) Whoo! All right, let's go. - We bad. - Oh, yeah. ( Laughing ) ( Music playing ) Do you know Laura's plans for after we get back? She got a volleyball scholarship to my college, but lately she said she's not going. Ah, I don't know what her plans are, but, heh, she's going. Good. It's a little selfish of me, but I was kind of afraid I'd have to go alone. It's a private religious college, did you know? Well, they've got a lot of secular majors for Laura to choose from, but, my future's already been decided. I'll be taking religion classes, so I can be a teacher in one of my church's schools. I think I'll be good at it. I hope I like it. How do you think people know what they're supposed to do with their lives? I mean, school doesn't teach you that. Mm. I... I... I wouldn't know. I... I... I've never had a job. And I... I... I live off disability and a trust fund from my parents. What would you do if your parents wanted you to do one thing... But in your heart, you really wanted to do something else? Do you think that voice in my heart is god? You got me. I'm currently not on speaking terms with god. Because of Cathy? Is she okay? Laura, I mean. There's just been so much, I mean, with graduation and her mom, but... Even before then, she seemed kind of... Forever sad ever since... Stacy died. I... I... I wouldn't know. Little bitch. ( Grunting ) ( Clears throat ) Wha... what's okay? She doesn't cry, a lot. Is... is that okay? I can't imagine what it must be like. It's scary enough going off into college out into the real world. I... I don't know what I would do if I didn't have my mom to talk to about it, even if we don't always agree. At least her mom's not hurting anymore. She's in heaven. Watching out for Laura... For all of us. You believe that, don't you, frank? I... I... I don't know what I believe. Sometimes I've wondered about it, you know? How do you know that the people who taught you to believe it... Were right to believe it themselves? I love this song. ( Music playing ) Things'll get better when it's Easter are you still sick? Are you still sick? People will be happy if I go I won't go out again Bonnie, don't you worry about me, so I've never been free, no, not really Bonnie, don't you worry about me, though I've never been free enough why would you mess with my head? Cuss and then repeat what I said and I carry a machine gun just to fix what you want no, don't you carry your machine gun just to spit what you want. ( grunting ) I have a name tag in my hair. Cool. - ( Laughing ) - ( Music playing ) Alisa: Ow! Kim. ( Mixed chatter ) All right. My kind of motel. So much for sleeping tonight. - Laura? - Yeah. ( Clears throat ) I... I... I lost my key ring. - What? - Yeah. How? Well, when we were, you know... Ugh, forget it... Forget it, frank. Oh, wait. You know, I'm gonna wait here. - So, here. - Thank you. - Can you guys? - Oh, yeah. ( Mixed background chatter, music playing ) You say he's your grandfather? Yep. You got different last names. - Uh-huh. - You adopted? Something like that. Mm-hmm. Well, I hope you don't mind a little noise. The owner son's having a... His graduation party. That little bastard's ruining the place. No, we don't... We don't mind the noise. ( Frank barking ) Did you hear a dog? No. There are no pets allowed in this place. Ma'am, how much can I give you for that key chain over there? What? All right, who's sleeping where? I'm not sleeping with any of you guys. I've got the cot. Well, that settles that. I'm gonna take a shower first, if that's okay? I feel dirty. Well, that's a first. - Ha, ha, ha-ha. - ( Giggles ) Mm, hey frank, chew on this. Ah. Thanks. - ( Grunts ) - Well. You guys sleep tight. I'm gonna go to that party. What? You can't go out there alone. - You don't know those people. - You're not my mother. - I do what I want. - I'm not your mother. But I'm your friend, and I think you should stay in. - That's how women go missing. - Kim, it's just a party. No one's getting murdered. You keep thinking like that, you'll always be afraid to live. ( Clears throat ) We've... we've all had a really long day, and tomorrow's another one. May... maybe you should, uh... You know, stay here and get a good night's sleep. Yeah, I'm gonna go to the party and find a hot guy to hang with tonight. - Alisa. - Later. Does she always try to go find a hot guy - to hang out with? - Yeah, that's the understatement of the year. She's not big on commitment. Alisa should be committed to an insane asylum. We can watch her from here. Kim: Yeah, as long as she stays outside. ( Music playing ) ( Mixed chatter ) Do you want me to take over? No, I'm good. Why don't you get some sleep? In a little bit. I'm not afraid to live, you know? I know. I just want to be smart about it. Not take every risk I can find like Alisa. I swear that girl's got a death wish. Maybe. ( Music playing, mixed background chatter ) Why does she hate me so much? She doesn't hate you. You guys are just... Different. No. She hates me. Stacy couldn't stand me, but at least she didn't hate me. No one hates you, Kim. They wouldn't have been your friends if they hated you. They wouldn't have been my friends if it weren't for you. You're the only reason they let me hang out with them. You know that's not true. I wish I could be more like you. Everybody loves you. You're the nicest person I know. You sat next to me on my first day of class. You always help Alisa out of her jams. You visited Stacy every day at the hospital. You took care of your mom when she was sick, and now you're taking care of frank. Come on! Hurry up! - Hurry up! - Go, go, go, go! - Oh, my god... - Oh, there it is! ( All yelling ) Oh, my god! Go! You're all gone! ( All cheering ) She went inside. I can't see her anymore. Okay, I'm gonna text her. Tell her to text us every five minutes so we know she's okay. - ( Phone buzzes ) - ( Gasps ) Oh, good. She texted back. Just one letter though. "F." - ( Phone buzzes ) - Oh, my god. - Here's another one. "U." Oh, my god. Do you think she's in trouble? Is she sending us a secret message one letter at a time? Yeah, she's sending us a secret message all right. What? F... ( Phone clicks ) It's late. I'm going to bed. You should, too. - What about Alisa? - She'll be fine. She always is. Come on, I want to talk to you. ( Alisa grunts ) What, you're not much of a talker? Ow! Can you slow down? No. Ow! Get off of me! Somebody help! Stop! Get off of me! - She said "stop!" - ( Grunts ) Now get out before I call the cops! You okay? Hey. ( Laughs ) - I know you. - Yeah. ( Kids playing ) Frank: God damn fucking assholes! ( Muffled yelling ) ( Music playing ) Hey, how 'bout we slow down? - Huh? Yeah? - All right. My eyes are blue... shame on you, bitch. Shame on you, bitch. Oh, my god. Frank, what're you doing? Is he a friend of yours? Yeah. Wake up, wake up say hello to what we have I know I'm braver than you I know you're shy but don't let that be why I can't be with you raise your stakes 'cause I will always drop by first so if the falling hurts you'll be my favorite scar... ( frank snoring ) Wake up. Alisa's not here. I didn't eat the cookie. - What? - Hey, Alisa's not here. Oh, my god! Someone killed her. She could be lying in a ditch somewhere. I told her not to go. - I told her, didn't I? - Ow. Who... who... who is dead? Alisa! Oh, check the car. ( Clears throat ) ( Snoring continues ) Is she alive? Oh, she's more than alive all right. I had to fight her off the whole night. Latte for Kim. Espresso for Laura. Hey, is frank up? You actually talked to Alisa last night? Yeah, is that unusual? Like a conversation? About us? Yeah, we talked all night. We watched the sun come up. You are the cute hitchhiker? Well, I do prefer to be called by my name. Vinnie. You must be frank. It's herbal tea. Alisa told me you had the tourettes. That means no caffeine, right? She wasn't sure what you drank in the morning, so I figured that was the best bet. ( Moans ) What're you staring at? ( Sighs ) Shit. Good morning, Princess. ( Sighs ) So, what's your boyfriend's name again? Vinnie. And he's not my boyfriend. Then why are you staring at them like a jealous girlfriend? I don't give a shit what they do together. Can we just leave already? Mm-hmm. - Hey. - Would you believe it, Vinnie's heading to the same place we are. Oh. Oh, well, not the cemetery. I'm hitching to my aunt's farm. It's only about, what, like, 20 miles away from where you guys are headed. And it's a big house. You guys can all stay there, and it's miles from anywhere. Frank can swear as loud as he likes, and he won't even get kicked out. He's going our way. He needs a ride. So... - Yeah, I don't see why not. - Ooh! Yay, you can come. ( Giggles ) Well, there's not gonna be enough room in the car. You know frank and his ticks. Oh, I... I don't mind getting hit in the face. I mean, that's what seven years of bad luck - does to a guy. - ( Giggles ) It's fine, right? Um... Oh, look, you know, I get it, guys. I don't want to cause any troubles, so... Ah, wait, Vinnie, just hang on a minute. - Kim: What? - I don't want him in the car. Why not? He's cute and he's nice. Total boyfriend material. He's a guy I hooked up with last night. That's it. And we can stay with his aunt for free. I'm sorry. No. I'm not spending hours trapped in a car with some random guy I hooked up with. It's not happening. Hey, Vinnie. ( Clicks tongue ) Let's go. ( Music playing ) ( Horn honks ) - ( Shuts music off ) - We're gonna play a game. Well, no, it's not really a game. We're gonna go around and say what's on our bucket list. Won't that be fun? Really? A bucket list? - Can it be anymore lame? - I'll go first. I want to teach in my church's school, volunteer in Africa for a year and start an orphanage. I want you to shut up for five minutes. Come on, this is important. We could all die today and have all these regrets. So it's good we list them all down now. Well, if we all died today, then your stupid list wouldn't matter, would it? Vinnie: I'll go. ( Clears throat ) I want to brew beer, start my own brewery, and then get married and have a huge family. Awe, that's so nice. All right, fine. I'll go. I wanna live every day like it's my last which is what I've been doing anyway. I wanna get a Harley and ride around the world. Where will you go? It doesn't matter. It's all about the journey and not the destination. Yeah, yeah, that's cool. I'd totally do that. I mean, you know, before I settle down and everything. Yeah, I'm not settling down. To be stuck in one place forever. Ugh. It sucks being stuck in hell. O-Kay. What about you, frank? Well, ( Chuckles ) I... I... I've never really thought about it. Stupid, crazy bitch. ( Grunting ) ( Clears throat ) I've always just lived day by day. With my condition there's certain limitations. So, I... I just stay at home and watch TV, read, listen to my music. I... I don't really dream of doing anything. Yeah, but if you could do anything, what would you do? Well... I have always been curious to try one thing. What? To drive. To drive? That's it? ( Laughs ) If you could do anything in this world and you just want to drive? Yeah, sit behind the wheel and have my foot on the pedal and just drive. Fucking asshole. ( Grunting continues ) - ( Clears throat ) - ( Alisa laughs ) What do you want to drive? Mm, anything. A car, a truck, a bus. Anything with wheels and a motor. Well, let's do it then. Laura, let him drive. There's no way I'm letting frank drive. Oh, come on. It's his dying wish. - Let the man drive. - I'm sorry, frank, but I don't think my parents would be too happy if I let you drive the car. Nah, it... it's okay. It's just a stupid wish. Fucking crazy bitches. - ( Clears throat ) - Yeah, my sentiments exactly. Well, what about you, Laura? What's on your bucket list? Uh... I don't know. I just graduated high school, I've worked really hard, and mom's was sick. I haven't had time to think about what comes next. You plan on going to college? We'll see. Um... I just want to make sure frank is settled - before I go. - ( Laughs ) Oh, she's going. There's no question about it. Well, it's my life, isn't it? All right. Say you don't go to college, what... what're you gonna do? I don't know, frank, but I'll figure it out. The problem is, you spend so much time thinking about everyone else, you haven't had any time to think about yourself. - Dumb bitch. - It's true, Laura. Not the dumb bitch, but the part before that. Yeah, I mean, frank can take of himself. Right, frank? What is this? An intervention? We're just saying that, you know, you need some time to take care yourself. - Right, guys? - Uh-huh. Has everyone aired out their grievances? 'Cause we're not talking about this anymore. Kids: ( Chanting ) Frank! Frank! Frank! - Ow! - ( Chanting continues ) We're here, frank. - Wow, this place is amazing. - I got it. The best place to grow up. Aunt Flossie! Kim: You got it? Alisa: Oh, have fun, guys. You coming? Cock fucking son of a slut whore. ( Barks ) Vinnie! ( Laughing ) Aunt Flossie, I'd like you to meet Alisa. Hi, nice to meet you. - Are you his girlfriend? - Oh, no, no, well, I... I mean, not yet anyway. Well, welcome Vinnie's not yet girlfriend. Thanks so much for having us. And these are her friends. This is Kim. - Hi. - Hi. Vinnie: Laura and... - bitch tractor fucker! ( Barking continues ) - Frank. Well, aren't you a colorful one. Welcome home. She's says that to everybody, but it's true. For the next couple of days consider this home. Or forever long you wanna stay. Come on. Come in, come in, and make yourself comfortable. Vinnie will take you upstairs and show you your bedrooms. I'm gonna make a little bit of tea. Thank you. Wow. Get that apple out. Now, you stay here, all right? You don't say a word. I don't want to hear you. I don't want to smell you. And for the life of god, keep that mouth closed. Okay, now, just stay right there. Don't you screw this up for me. Okay. Hello, hello. Oh, am I interrupting? You got company? - Come in, come in, come in. - Oh. Yeah, I just wanted to drop by and bring you some apples from the trees. Aw, thank you, preacher Alexander. Well, you keep baking those apple pies and I'll keep bringing them over. Stupid Jesus lover bitch! ( Clears throat ) Sorry. Fucking shit eating whoreface Bible trash! ( Grunting ) Well, my offer still stands, Flossie. And you know I'm offering more than market value for this house. I don't think we should be talking about this now. You're not seriously gonna sell the house to Puggis, are you? Your uncle promised Puggis that if he would stay and work the farm and take care of it, he would sell it to him for a lower price. Yeah, but he's not taking care of it, and besides, you know uncle is in no condition to be making those decisions. You know Puggis manipulated him. I don't know that. Oh, g... You fucking freak show. Why didn't you stay in your mama's womb? Oh. Stupid fucking white trash bitch! - ( Clears throat ) - Dear god... What the hell is go... Ah, shit. Are you the preacher's son? Y... yeah, yeah. I'm his son, John. Wh... why hasn't anyone fixed your teeth? ( Sniffs ) My... my pa says it's the way god wants me to be. So... I already told you, preacher man, she ain't sellin' to you. Well, that's for her to decide, don't you think? After all I done for you, you and your husband. Is this how you gonna treat me? He made me a promise, a fucking promise. This is her house to sell, so she's making the call. The offer's good until Monday. - You think... - y'all go get the hell outta here! Go on! She ain't got nothin' to think about, preacher. ( Door slams ) Fucking Satan worshiping asshole! Hey, don't swear in front of my son! In fact, I don't want you talkin' to him, neither. Why didn't you stay put like I told you to... Fix his fucking teeth! I'm not sorry. Your husband made me a promise on his deathbed. You got to honor that. Oh, yeah, you're the one to talk about honor. Making him promise you to sell the house for almost nothing on his last breath. This is between your aunt and me. You ain't got nothin' to do with this, boy. If I ever see that preacher around here again... There's gonna be trouble. ( Door opens, closes ) You ever meet someone who doesn't give a fuck? Well, I don't give a fuck. You wanna bully someone? You bully me. Get off me, you retard. You nut! Don't worry, aunt Flossie. Everything's gonna be okay. I don't know what to do. Just leave it to me. I'll take care of everything. ( Knocking on door ) Hey, aunt flossie's taking a nap. Anyone up for a swim? - Yes! - Yeah. - Fuck yeah. - Okay. ( Music playing ) You're a lot like me you got your sensibility it shouldn't make you nervous when we're talkin' in the breeze well, everyone's got their idea of who you shouldn't be but I won't compromise us all even if it's killing me pressed against the rails and, lord, you know I chose to die but just because you're winning doesn't mean they're on your side - get in the water. - No way. And everyone's got obstacles they'll throw into your life - come on! Come on! - No. No. But I can't help you out at all not until you decide no! No! And I won't miss you anymore and our lips won't kiss the portions we've sold I believe we were framed from the start with all the links that have torn us apart You're a lot like me you've got your sensibilities it shouldn't make you nervous we're just talking in the breeze... - all: Hello. - Ha-ha. You look like you had some fun. Hurry up and get changed, I'll be ready in a few minutes. But I won't compromise us all the salt you put in me and I won't miss you anymore... ( sighs ) Well, I think that was the best meal I've ever had in my entire life. - Thank you. - ( Laughs ) You know, I really like having you girls here. I don't get a lot of visitors except for Vinnie. Oh, we'll be sure to visit you then. Really? I'd like that. Alisa. Sorry. Is this okay? What? Did you think your generation invented this? ( Laughs ) Some of us use it to calm our ticks from time to time. Besides, didn't someone once tell me I shouldn't be afraid of a little danger now and then? Oh... I haven't done this in so long. ( Giggles ) - ( Hacking ) - ( Laughing ) - Ah! - ( Frank laughs ) Why do you think we hurt the ones we love? Whoa. That shit is deep, Kim. We just started passing the joint. ( Groans ) You know, I don't think we hurt the ones we love. It's just that when we love someone, we care so much that... We can hurt them. Yeah, I'm not gonna get myself stuck in that trap. I don't buy that. I bet there's nothing better than falling in love. Well... ( Clears throat ) I can't say I know anything about falling in love, but I do know about being alone. Ah, fucking bitch loser. ( Barking ) ( Clears throat ) But I can tell you this. ( Sighs ) Well, I don't care how much losing Laura's mom hurts, I wouldn't trade a second of the time I had her in my life. Even if it meant I could get rid of all this pain. Living... Being alone... It's worse than any hurt. Hmm. In all my life, I've pushed people away. ( Chuckles ) Ironic, isn't it? I've avoided going out to stores being in public places. I've always been afraid of what other people might think. Motherfucking whores. ( Barking continues ) ( Chuckles ) You even made those stupid name tags just in case I did meet someone who didn't understand. Do those work? Not really. ( Sighs ) But you know what? I don't care anymore. I... I... I'm sick and tired of not doing what I want because I might offend other people. ( Sighs ) I wanna see what's... What's out there... Who enjoy people. So, I've decided... I'm gonna stop being miserable. I'm not gonna live in fear anymore. And you shouldn't either, Flossie. You sell this wonderful place for as much as you can. Life's too short. Chicken shit! Well, I don't really have a choice. Either I sell it to Puggis or the bank gets it. No. Frank is absolutely right. We shouldn't live in fear anymore. What did uncle promise? He promised to sell the house to Puggis so he can take care of the farm. And he hasn't been and he won't. We're not breaking a promise. You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna keep the farm. - Can you? - No. - No, of course we can't. - Sure we can. I'm gonna move back here with you. I'll help you run the farm and get it up and running again, so we can make those payments. We're gonna make this work. Oh, Vinnie, I love you for that. You can't come back here. You've got your whole life ahead of you. Aunt Flossie, you took care of me my whole life. You are my life. I think that's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. Tomorrow, everything's gonna be different. I'm into that. Stupid bitch farm. Speaking of tomorrow. What time do you guys want to head out to the cemetery? We'll go after breakfast. I just need to find a church to go to, but I'm good after that. You'll come with, won't you, Vinnie? Well, if you... If you want me there. We want you there, don't we? Sure. It's a birthday party anyway. ( All laughing ) Where's the joint? ( Knocking on door ) Alisa: Come in. Are you girls gonna be okay in here? It's a little cramped. We'll be just fine. Thank you. This works for us. We're really close. ( Laughs ) All right, then. - Good night. - Girls: Good night. - Good night, frank. - Yeah. Are you sure you want to stay here? Because this room can really be hot. Ah, better if I'm away from everybody. I can be loud and won't wake anyone. Okay. Well, here we go. Frank: Bitch. ( Grunts ) - Franklin! - ( Distant ) Frank! ( Grunting continues ) Son of a bitch. ( Barking ) Children: ( Chanting ) Frank! Frank! ( Echoing ) Franklin, that's enough! ( Chanting continues, sound of tape rewinding ) - On this number... - Yeah, yeah! ( Chanting continues ) ( Blinds clatter ) ( Water dripping ) ( Engine turns over ) ( Gears grinding ) ( Grinding continues ) Where's frank? Oh, my god! ( Dog barking ) ( Revs engine ) ( Barking continues ) ( Banjo music playing ) Frank! - Frank! - Pull over! Hey, frank! Whew! ( Overlapping yelling ) - Frank! - Vinnie: No, frank! I'm driving! I'm driving! - No! - No, frank! No! ( Yells ) ( Loud crash ) - Ah! - Sorry. ( Sighs ) All right, try not to sleep on your face. I'm sorry. You tell me I'll never have to worry about you, frank, but you're always getting yourself into trouble. I didn't plan it. I... I... I woke up in front of that tractor. And, Laura... There it was my dream come true. And, that damn Puggis... Stupid redneck bitch! ( Barking ) I... I just didn't care. I... I got on it and I started driving, Laura. Me. I took you on this trip. Now, I don't know. Somehow I wanted to convince myself that you really were okay to be on your own. But everything that you've done so far has made me realize you're never gonna be okay alone. Am I ever gonna get to live my life without always worrying about you? ( Door closes ) ( Music playing ) We see what you do when you're out by yourself now I'm not talking Hollywood where all, all is swell you forget what they meant to say better off, you're too sweet let's sway by this coffin from the lake then we're not too late we still have time to change and if not for the great and the grace. You coming with us? You really want me to? See you downstairs. ( Laura gasping ) - ( Gasping continues ) - Jesus Christ, Laura, are you okay? What's going on? What's wrong with her? - I'm... - I think she's having a panic attack. - Can you pull over? - Are you all right, Laura? - Laura? - Um... - Okay... - Breathe. I... I... need to go to church anyways, so, let's just stop and have a breather, okay? I never thought I'd say yes to church, but, why the hell not? - Okay, great. - Just breathe. ( Music playing in church ) Okay, yeah. This'll calm you down a little bit. - Come on. - Okay. Okay. ( Music continues ) Good lord don't let no devil their house hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah lord, they ain't got no devil in their house we got the good lord, hallelujah we got the good lord, hallelujah we got the good lord, hallelujah we got the good lord, hallelujah... - praise the baby Jesus! - don't let the devil in my don't let the devil in my house. Preacher: Yeah, yeah! Yeah, the lord! The lord sends fire from the gates of hell to rain down on those demon worshipers! Those Satan worshipers corrupting this world. But darkness, she's still... The devil is in that man! Damn son of a bitch, serpent worshiping, kiss my ass, Sally! Won't even fix your own kid's teeth! Up yours! Up yours! Up yours, stupid bitch! - ( Barking ) - The devil. - The devil is in that man. - I'm not sorry! - ( Barking continues ) - The devil is in that man! Smite that devil. ( Screams ) Holy fucking Christ. That wasn't... What was that? Oh, god, you can't call that chr... Christian. ( Sobbing ) How can someone mistake me as being possessed by the devil? Stup... stup... stupid bitch! ( Grunts ) I... I'm such a normal, ordinary guy. ( All laughing ) Oh, frank. ( Laughing continues ) They had snakes in that church. - ( Laughs ) - Snakes. ( Music playing over car radio ) What the hell? Now, Puggis, don't get upset. What the fuck happened to my tractor? Now... it... it was an accident. - And, um... - It was Vinnie, wasn't it? Motherfuckin' little shit! It was not Vinnie. It... it was frank. You see, he sleepwalks, and he acci... Well, he drove your tractor. Yeah, well, I'll teach that bastard. He'd better not touch my things because somebody's gonna pay for this! - Puggis, don't you dare! - Accident, my ass. Puggis, don't... don't... ( Sighs ) Here we are. Here we are. Kim: I'll get our stuff. I'll help you out. Okay. I'll wait here. Are you sure? Yeah. You go and have a good time. ( Sighs ) I couldn't afford... I couldn't afford to buy you anything. So, I knitted this for you. I hope you like it. ( Sniffs ) It's alpaca. - Happy birthday, Stace. - ( Sniffs ) Hmm. ( Clicking ) Maybe you should go check up on them. Laura: Am I ever gonna get to live my life without always worrying about you? Frank: You don't have to worry about me. Laura: God, why did you take the rope, frank? Frank: You sleepwalk now, too? Laura, ( Clears throat ) I... I just want you to know that... I'm not going anywhere. I'm... I'm here for you whenever you might need me. Thank you. I am glad and I will need you. ( Sighs ) Hey, how do you suppose that mom knew I needed to come here? Why would I want to visit the grave of my best friend right when I was about to lose her? Ah, I... I... I don't know. Closure I guess. Stacy was wild crazy. She loved life so much she sometimes took it too far. I'd gotten over her death by focusing only on all the things that I didn't like about her. Maybe your mom... Didn't want you to get over her that way. Maybe she wanted you to remember the best of her. I think we're gonna be okay, frank. Yeah, we're... We're gonna be just fine. I don't want you fraternizing with that devil man again! I almost lost you to the devil, and thankfully he only scarred you with them demon choppers! You understand me? Now, I want your face in that Bible! I want the baby Jesus spirit to flow all over you and heal you, son! Now, stay down there! Yeah. Come on. Yeah! ( Screams ) Yeah! Corinthians said, "you live by faith not by words." Yeah... Oh, no. No, no, no. You need to Polish the baby Jesus. Polish the baby Jesus. You... you want me to read or do you want me to Polish... Don't back talk me, boy! You Polish the baby Jesus. Okay, okay. Retard touched my shit. ( Mumbling ) retard son of a bitch. ( Music playing over car radio ) Well... I guess I'm not gonna need that anymore. - ( Laughs ) - Oh, come on, frank. You don't wanna waste a perfectly good name tag. ( Screams ) Oh, that devil of a man. He needs to feel the wrath of god. Yeah! ( Rattling noise ) ( Music continues ) ( Rattling continues ) Flossie: Let me out. Let me out of here! ( Chuckles ) 'Bout fuckin' time. ( Crow cawing ) ( Shot rings out ) Frank! Frank! ( Sound of muffled elevated heartbeat ) Laura: Frank! - Shit. - Oh, no. ( Muffled ) Frank? Frank? Frank! Oh, my god, frank! ( Voices echoing ) Frank, don't you dare leave me behind. Don't you dare. Puggis, put the gun down! Be smart! Wait a minute, son! Look! The gun ain't even loaded. What the? - ( Muffled heartbeat ) - ( Groaning ) ( Sobbing ) Frank? Come on, frank! Frank! ( Beating stops ) ( Music playing ) I never knew hate not like today with yellow red sparks I never knew how to grasp... whoa, hang on. Are you family? Yeah, I'm the only family he's got. Oh, okay. Sorry, go ahead. ( Music continues ) ( Sobbing ) Can you hear me, frank? I need you, frank. I've always needed you. Please. ( Gasping ) Can you, um... Hey. Didn't I tell you? I'm not going anywhere. While this sad priest is counting grievances for me and I'm I'm so scared... frank: Laura did go to college. She even graduated with honors. I was there. Yep. Third row on the isle. ( Barking ) Stupid bitch! Sorry. Make you custard with yellow red sparks make you custard with yellow red sparks another war won we are young might as well have some fun stressed, stressed to be blessed if heaven is rest then I'll be its best while this sad priest is counting grievances for me and I'm well, I'm not scared for the first time but I'll never know why we're all so weak but they can't stop our yellow red sparks no, they can't stop our yellow red sparks and I can't be anything but yours. ( music playing ) Here we go. I might pick the better side of frustration go to other parties on the lower side of damnation how many other ones I want around I might look you straight in the eyes with everything in me yeah, whoa-oh I can't deny there's a darkness I withhold my prints of wax my best friend I can't deny when my best friend grabs and holds hold on oh! I can't deny there's this darkness I withhold my prints of wax my best friend I can't deny when my best friend grabs and holds hold on oh! I might be a time bomb but I got the fix and I might be waiting for the right time to blow.
