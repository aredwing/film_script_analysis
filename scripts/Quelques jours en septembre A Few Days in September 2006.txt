I was told that many years ago you were left with grandmother, i did not know that for so long. Here is my home. in 10 years you lived in 3 countries and wanted to travel all the world. For 10 I collected memories and now I want to forget everything. Successfully? I have a letter from Elliot. - So what? - He wants to see you. - Why? - I don't know. In the evening in Paris. What is this? One of the toys he left me. You will not need him. From where do you know Elliot? Is there M. Elloit? He warned he would be late. He asked to wait for him in the suite. Be careful. - With what? - With the gun. It is not mine, a friend lent it to me. I promised not to use it. Then why did you load it? I was warned that you are still by the same. Wanted to scare you. Go on, scare. Only Elliot could choose such a foolish name. When Elliot or Mulligan was leaving France, he had no son. He married my mother when I was 13. Ah so... Then meet your sister. - My sister? - Yes, your sister. Before leaving for States your dad had a family. Are you sure? - Why did not he tell me? - I don't know. Hello. Is M. Mulligan at home? Perhaps he registered as Elliot. I was told that 2 women will come and an American. "They are not expecting me at this party, "I wanted to make a surprise". OK. I shall warn them. If you'll warn them, it would not be a surprise. Elliot just left in a taxi. How's that? He was watching in the opposite house. - You know him? - No. A lucky one. - You did not remember? - No. William Pound. used to work with your dad. He appears when a dirty job is needed. Good evening, William Pound speaking. Yes, I just killed somebody. Do not be so sad. He was just a concierge. The only thing that worries me is that I lost again. I had a feeling, that I betrayed myself. Yes, I know. They are arriving. - What is it? - A turtle. - What's her name? - It's him, his name is Tortue. - What shall we do? - It's 3 in the night. We shall sleep. Good night. Hello, Mlle Montano. I hope during the night you did not do anything foolish. We did not want to disturb your guests. We are trying to find your friend - M. Elliot. You are his friend too? He is already working for us several years. That means? We represent a goup of banks. M. Elliot is consulting us about investments. He did not know anything about finances before. He is not an economist. But he can get information regarding to finances. His advices are valuable. I like stories with happy endings. The problem is that M. Elliot disappeared few weeks ago and his last advices concerned serious sums of money invested in, let us say, in certain sectors. I have not seen Elliot for 10 years. We know it. We also know, that 6 days ago he sent you a letter. Yes, but he did not come. He knows I love animals, so he made an ass out of me. Our headquarters are in Riyadh, but our European office is in Venice. If you hear something new - call us. Even if you don't let us know. Perhaps we'll have an offer for you. Goodbye, madam. What do you think about it? Well, easy. No, I did not think about my father. Frankly, I did not think about anything. Yes, concierge - a man with keyes and a candle. pervert and so on. I had not anything fallic in mind or anything concerning sex. Well, allright. Thank you, doctor, I feel myself better now. See you soon. She would not bite you. Shit! Irene, this is William Pound. - How are you? - Great. - And you? - Fine. And ressurrected few months ago. Elliot called you? Called somebody who stole his cellphone. And what did he say? Wanted to see me, but so that you won't find out. It is lovely that he called you. I did not know that you communicate. May I offer you a coffee? No, for some time I don't have breakfast with rats. - Tell me, what is going on? - Sure. Your father disappeared about a month ago. A bunch of people are trying to find him, but he wants to meet you and your brother, but so, that the others don't find out. But why did he disappear I don't know. - Who called? - William Pound. You saw him in the hotel. Once he considered himself a spiritual son of your father. - But whom considered him my dad? - Who he really was. Your brother is a sweetheart. What do we do? Wal a bit, then have a dinner. - I think the guy is dangerous. - He's searching your dad, not us. Yes, but for other people. And what do you do now? Still working for the government, but in the office. Government now has German cars? In Europe. And what did my father do besides raising him? No. He said it was not his decision to return to States and change the name. Take me with him or leave me here it is also a choise? But him? Let us ask to bring him a sandwich. A bottle of Corton-Charlemagne. And please a bottle of Volnay'98? You told you don't speak French. For you, monseiur. Zucchini-mynte consomme and Volnay'98. Not the soup. Thank you. Thank you. She is being followed. Any news from M. Elliot? No. - Are you following me? - Yes, but not we alone. I know. Called M. Elliot, he wants to meet you and the children. Can we count on you? We are interested in several details of your cooperation with M. Elliot. What details? When was the last time you met him? He had to arrive in Venice on August. We had to meet in Washington, but he changed the place to Venice. It's a pity, he didn't come. Are you angry? We have nothing to hide. Why did he change the place? It was a responsible period for him in the States. Why responsible? We did not change the place. Our cooperation relies on getting information from him. - I still don't understand... - Came to Venice. - I will. - With kids. With kids. - I thought it was not him calling. - Somebody called from him. I agree go to cafe. Ah so? Why? Let's say, I like to look a rat in the eyes, than feel his breath in the spine. Great. Where do you want to meet? Why don't you come up? - Elliot's kids are there? - Sorry. I prefer to meet in another place. - Remember cafe "Raymonde"? - Yes. - In an hour, OK? - Thanks. - A call for you! - Thank you. This is Irene, I'll be in 15 minutes. Very nice. Call me to my cellphone. I need to be sure that you are in "Raymonde". Bye. Shit! Good evening, Doctor, this is William Pound. No, I did not kill anybody, I just lost one more time. Let's say, I trusted the intuition and got fooled. Have to watch out. If he wants he'll find us. - Why? - What - why? If he finds us anyway? If they want to find Elliot, they'll find him. It is a question of time and means, but I don't know about either. I recall an argument with my brother. We were on vacation in Qimper. I can't recall the reason of the argument, but I clearly remember the shame I felt. The same feeling came back tome, when I finished my first assignment with Elliot. He was reading Homer! He passionately loves poems. I confessed, I haven't read, and I know nothing about it. In Qimper. Yes, Qimper! Comper. Father - Pre. Yes, Homer! Bravo! That's it: Mre - mother! I am a fool! It is obvious. Thank you, Doctor. My friends have no passports. - I'll give you $ 500. - 800. OK. Then you pay for croissants. You really knew nothing about David? No, I only knew that your father has changed his name. And how do you like it? Like his father - a poet. - And, by the way, geese. - What - geese? I don't raise ducks, I raise geese. - Why without us? - I don't know them well. - You came with kids? - Yes. If you can call them kids. M. Elliot just called. He said he wants to change the date of the meeting. It will take place in 3 days. If you remain in Venice, we have a company apartment. Thank you. Can you call Elliot? No, he calls us. He tried to meet you but could not. Why did he change the date again? We don't know. We said that Pound did not came with you, but he said that he postponed the meeting not because of him. - Will you remain? - I don't know. Kids wanted to ride a boat and go to the beach. Do not play with us, mademoiselle. Stuff your - monsieur, mademoiselle, madame. Make it clear. What is the reason for the meeting? M. Elliot was giving us advices for some years, where to invest. M. Elloit got a half percent of the income, which grow bigger due to his advices. As an employee of American agency, he had a circle of friends, helping him to forecast the scams of the federal government. M. Elliot worked with us time after time. His share consisted of several hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now he offers us to withdraw all the money, that had been invested in the territory of the United States. He thinks his share would be And he wants them to be shared between his children. You spoke about Elliot, as of former US special agent. We know, that half a year ago he started to work for the US government again. If not this, we would never started to follow such an absurd advice. American government would not allow their agent... That is why he wants the money for his children. And we are talking about 30 millions. M. Elliot is a big boy, and he understands the risks. What may signify such a big money? He thinks that the dollar will fall about 20%. What may cause this? The murder of a president or a new war. - What do you do? - We wait. - You missed. - And you? - I don't know. Have to think. - Where to? - Take a leak. Either Caparros or De Carvalho? Igor Zyberski? Where they have to meet? In Venice. Yes, we should check it. Don't forget about my accounts. - With whom did you talk? - With a minister I know. Playing spy games again? Asked to feed the turtle. We'll meet at home. You are not changing. But you are changing for the better. Everyting is changing, my dear. - But Elliot? - What - Elliot? I was told you met him in Berlin on June and in Hamburg on July. - Impossible to hide anything from you. - What were those meetings about? These were not meetings, I was a courrier. Any ideas about it? Frankly - no. But I know a person, who might have recordings of an important meeting. How much does it cost? I don't know if he wants to sell, especially to French. You are such a bastards. I'm not French. I'll pay what he asks. Call me. Irene Montano met Igor Zyberski. - Where? - In Venice. - Where is your brother? - Upstairs. - Fighting again? - No. Can't stand this game any more. You loved anybody? Let's say - yes and no. - And for real? - For real? For real - no. No. Me too. And do not want? - One more? - Wont be too much? No. A bit more and I'll end up leaving you in the street dead drunk. Yes? We'll see. - You bet? - On what? On a night with him. - You should ask him. - I'm drunk, not stupid. If we ask him I'll lose my chance. Not sure if drunk, but there'll be no chance. There I think. No, my mistake. Should be there. Our road leads to distant shores and elusive dreams. Our road leads to distant shores and elusive dreams. Igor Zyberski. I spoke with my friend. He is ready to sell you the recording for $ 10 000. Didn't you forget to tell him all French are bastards? No, when he heard with whom you live, he understood that it won't be you who pays. - You heard the recording? - No. What is it about? Strong. Very. Could not understand all, but strong. Will you bring it to me? - Remember "Vini da Schiari"? - Yes. - At 9 o'clock. - OK. - Look how nice. - You shure? Look at them! Do you like? Wait! I can carry 2 more bags. I'll get you in a moment. You are not so strong! We adviced you to stay in shadows. I'm doing it. Why did you met Igor Zyberski? He's an old acquaintance of mine. M. Elliot called us. He'll be in Venice tomorrow evening. What you have done would not cancel the meeting? Ask him to call me. - Sorry, I'm late. - They should be sorry. What happened? Are you fighting? It is not teeth. You should not brush it every day. Brushing teeth irritates me, but cleaning a gun - pacifies. Irene loves Elliot. Elliot loves William Blake. Good evening, Doctor. Yes, I know, it's already late, but I need to talk to you. Everything is OK. I think I'm well. I think I could kill my dad, and now without a doubt. Yes, I promise to call you. Good night, Doctor. What? Where is he? - Where is he? - The gun is not loaded. Will you talk with father? I asked you a question. Answer me. I swear on the head of your Tortue. - Good evening. - Here are the children. My companion went to the airport to get Elliot. We'll have to wait. Yes, I promised to call you. Yes I know, but... No, I do not understand you, Doctor. You told me yourself that Elliot looks like father, it is important - to kill the dad. It is symbolic. What does it change? Believe me, you're wrong. Believe me, craving for action sometimes is a sign of a good mental health. Call the doctor. This is your fault, Mlle Montano. We have to know, why you ordered to transfer all our assets from America. We are not sure, should we follow your advice. - Are you a doctor? - A surgeon! I came to kill, but not you. I want to know where are the fuses. Where?! He is here, I'll take care of him. It is a pity we could not have a cup of coffee in Paris. You arrived yesterday? Hardly managed. Zyberski asked me to stand in for him. He even begged. Touche! - Will you follow his advice? - Yes. Do your group guard the interests of Saudi Arabia? Not only. We are guarding interests of certain persons in Saudi Arabia, Europe, and also America. - What was on the disc? - The proof. Of what? Of the event what will soon take place. What are you going to do? I don't know yet. In New York thousands of people are being evacuated... from twin skyscrapers. Streets are full of people running... as far as possible from the World Trade Center...
