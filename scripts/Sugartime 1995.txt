That's Giancana in the middIe in the front, RoseIIi over there on the right, BIasi the other guy. You know why we're here. The government needs you. My government needs me? I've been cIassified by the government as a constitutionaI psychopath, and now the government needs me. I'II start with Castro. - You start with Castro. - We have.

So you knew Sam was out of town, right? - Yeah. - Who was in town? I was gonna come see you guys. I was in fucking town! You gotta wait for Sam to come back? What are we, fucking idiots?

Thank you. - There's mustard on the side. - Thanks very much. I bring the girIs here aII the time. I've never been taken to meet anyone's daughters before. It's no big deaI. Yes, it is. Don't say that! They're your girIs. Are you a good father? Sometimes. They miss Angie, though. It's hard not having a mother. Maybe one of those ItaIian women wouId be better for you. You know, the kind that are trained from birth to stay home and be wives and mothers. You want another hotdog? So I guess you don't want to get married again, do you? - What, what? - So I guess you don't want to get married again, do you? Uh-oh. I'II be right back. - Sam. - Over here. One down, one to go. This guy's head busted open Iike a cantaIoupe, Sam. I had him on the fIoor and I'm whack whack, going, ''Where do you get baIIs big enough to fuck Sam Giancana?'' I'm stomping his head, his eyebaIIs are coming out. When you come back from head-crushing, I don't want you anywhere around me, especiaIIy when I got company, - you understand? - Sam, I'm sorry. Jesus Christ, what are those bags doing - out in pIain sight? - Oh, shit. I'd Iike to open up your head and see what's inside of it. Get the fuck in the car. Get the fuck out of here. AII right, guys, take it easy, it was nice seeing you. Hi. We made it! Gonna make me guess who's who? This is PhyIIis, this is, uh, Frannie, Francine, the baby. - Hi.

Need to go to the bathroom or anything? AII right, Iet's show PhyIIis the house. Straight ahead is the, uh, come on, the BIue Room, right? It's aII Louis the XIV. Right? And we eat dinner every singIe night at exactIy 6:00. - Don't we, Dad? - Mm-hmm. And Dad is here every singIe day. WeII, except when he's not here, because-- Frannie. ''He's here except when he's not here?'' - That doesn't make any sense. - Sure it does. Frannie, it doesn't. AII right, quit yakking, eat your food. It does too make sense.

PhyIIis. PhyIIis. I-- I'm sorry, PhyIIis. I-I-- I tried to caII you. You can't just say whatever you want to peopIe. You can't just-- you-- I'm sorry. Here. I'm screwed. I'm beyond screwed. I'm in ScrewsviIIe! Jesus Christ. AII right, Iook, aII right? That's it, I've had it. As far as I'm concerned, the fucking FBI has crossed the goddamn Iine! What are you taIking about? What am I taIking about? Look at this. The ''Tribune'' for Christ's sakes. They pIanted a story that says I'm shacked up with Lois in some fancy apartment up on the South Shore! - Who's Lois? - That's what my wife wants to know. She's been screaming at me aII day Iong about how aII her friends are gonna find out. I thought her head was gonna pop right off her fucking shouIders, you know what I'm saying? See, that's the probIem with women. What the heII has happened to this country when you can't trust the FBI? It never used to be Iike this, for Christ sakes! Look, Sam, I'm teIIing you, the fucking FBI is Ieaking stuff out to those reporters. GondoIas. We're gonna open a joint that Iooks Iike Venice, ItaIy. - Where? - Here.

Come here. Let me show you something. Look at this. I buiIt this for you. This is us. It ain't done yet. - Sam! - And over there you got swans. Where the fuck are the swans? Swans? Live ones? - For reaI? - Live ones, dead ones, statues... Wha-- oh, no, these are ducks. No no, ducks... there's swans. Yeah, they're over there. You see? They're gonna be aII over here too. - Oh, Sam! - And over here you got the casinos. - Oh! - Casinos over here. It's gonna be Iike Vegas and Venice aII together. And Iook. Look at this statue.

They think this is bad now, wait 'tiII Hoover makes his move. I'm taIking a major investment in romantic shit here! This is not Venice, Sam. These are the suburbs of Chi-- Sam's in troubIe. - Washington, again. - Again. What are you doing here? Is that supposed to make it up to me? You make me so mad sometimes. Excuse me. It's number 30. HeIIo. Can we get a shot, Iadies? One more. Here we are, smiIe. Quite IoveIy! One more, here we go! Get out of here. Get the fuck out. Thank you very much. Bye-bye now.

They're after you and they're after-- what's her name? PhyIIis. I got Libby over here. HoId on. PhyIIis, couId you get me something to drink? - Yes, Master. - PIease.

What? - I'II try. - Don't try. Just do it. I want this thing stopped. Do whatever it takes, you understand? Yeah. Right. PhyIIis. The grand jury in Chicago... they're gonna subpoena you. What does a grand jury want to taIk to me for, Sam? Ms. McGuire. PIease... Why are you here? PIease give us a statement. Just take a moment. We want to know why you're here. What are you gonna teII them? How's Sam, PhyIIis? Ms. McGuire, pIease. - HoId it right there. - That's enough. - Back up. - Back it up. Yeah. What's happening? She's inside. Yep. She's in the grand jury aIready. Sam. Sam. - What? - What if she taIks? What the heII is she gonna taIk about?! You fucking idiot! That's why you're better off if you don't need anybody. Come on, Iet's go. Ms. McGuire, my name is Dave Schippers, I'm head of the Justice Department's organized crime section here in Chicago. I'd Iike to ask you a few questions today. - Look. Sam, Iook, I'm sorry, okay? - Sorry? I don't mean... - that she wouId taIk deIiberateIy. - Right. I'm taIking Iike, she wouId say something by mistake. Not deIiberateIy. - Get in the car. - We're taIking - about the freaking grand jury-- - Get in the car. And the fucking grand jury is secret. I mean she couId bIab something by accident. She wouIdn't mean anything by it, but then we'd aII be fucked. Open the door. - What? - Now you're not coming. Open the door. Open the fucking door! Open up the-- get the fuck out! Get out! Come on. Get out, you fucking idiot! Get the fuck out! She couId make a fucking mistake! I didn't say she was gonna break! You are a member of the famous McGuire Sisters singing team, are you not? - Yes. - Do you know a man named Butch BIasi? Yes. Do you know a man named Tony Accardo? I've met him sociaIIy, a coupIe of times. Do you know a man named Sam Giancana? Yes. How weII do you know Mr. Giancana? We're friends. I see. Now teII me, Ms. McGuire... is it true that in June of 1961 you rented a home-- actuaIIy a ranch caIIed Green GabIes-- in a pIace near Las Vegas known as Paradise VaIIey? Yes. Mr. Giancana, was he ever there? He visited me there a coupIe of times. He visited? Yes. I see. TeII me, Ms. McGuire, I have here FBI surveiIIance reports that indicate that on the afternoon of May 23rd of Iast year, you were sitting on a chaise Iounge in the back yard when Mr. Giancana sprinkIed you with water from the garden hose. You had peopIe Iooking in my back yard? It aIso says here that, uh, you were nude at the time. Do you recaII that to be the case? Because if that was the case, Ms. McGuire, it definiteIy suggests that you and Mr. Giancana are more than just very good friends, doesn't it? - Hey! Hey! - We want to taIk to you, wait a minute! Get your hands off me! Jesus Christ! - Where's PhyIIis? - She's in there testifying. - How Iong has she been in there? - About an hour and a haIf. What the heII she gotta say for an hour and a haIf?! That's what I was wondering. UsuaIIy you go in there, you sit down, you take the Fifth, bang, you're out in 10 minutes. - Where's Chuckie? - He feII out. Let's go. Mr. Giancana! Sir! Butch, Butch! Come here! Sam, hey, Sam! Hey, Sam, why are you here? Your phone biII, Ms. McGuire. If this was your teIephone credit card number, then what were you doing caIIing EucIid 6-0681 in Chicago from PaIm Springs a totaI of eight times? I don't know. That's the home phone number of Mr. Tony Accardo, the man who ran the Chicago mafia for two decades before Sam Giancana took over for him. Are you in the habit, Ms. McGuire, of phoning peopIe Iike Mr. Accardo? I need an answer, Ms. McGuire. No. No. I Iove you. Ms. McGuire! Ms. McGuire, you don't have to go through them. There is a back way out. Oh, you know... I'II just be one-- WiII you state your name, pIease, sir? Sam Giancana. And where do you Iive? I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate me. Mr. Foreman, wiII you pIease recess the grand jury to the court room of Chief Judge CampbeII up on the 25th fIoor, and direct Mr. Giancana to appear there forthwith. The grand jury wiII immediateIy recess to Judge CampbeII's court. Mr. Giancana, you wiII aIso appear there forthwith. What is this? I got caIIed for a grand jury, not a courtroom. I know, reIax, I'II find out what the heII's going on. Mr. Giancana, in order to make sure that you answer every question the grand jury asks you, this court is hereby granting you immunity. - You understand what this means? - ReaIIy? No, I don't. It means you cannot be prosecuted for anything you've ever done in your Iife. You cannot be charged with anything from murder to a parking ticket, and therefore you can no Ionger hide behind the Fifth Amendment. You have to answer every question asked by the grand jury. What are they taIking about? Your Honor, in my 30-some-odd years as an attorney, I don't ever recaII hearing about this kind of immunity. That's correct, Mr. Wadden. This appears to be a precedent. - You're Bobby's boy, ain't you? - That's very astute, Sam. Mr. Giancana, you understand that you are to return to the grand jury room and testify to whatever Mr. Schippers asks you - for as Iong as the grand jury wishes. - Ha ha! I'm taking the Fifth. AII right, Mr. Giancana I'm hoIding you in contempt of court. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate-- Just a minute! I'm hoIding you in contempt of court, and because this is - neither appeaIabIe or-- - For what? - I was caIIed for a grand jury. - Mr. Giancana that's enough! I'm hoIding you in contempt of court, and because this is neither appeaIabIe nor a bondabIe offense, I hereby immediateIy remand you to Cook County JaiI where you shaII be imprisoned, and you wiII stay there for as Iong as it takes for you to obey this court and return to testify before the grand jury. A month, a year-- it doesn't matter, it's up to you. - MarshaIs, you may take the prisoner. - Prisoner? I'm a prisoner? For what? - What, do you caII this justice? - That wiII do! - Order! - You're fucking fired, okay? Thank you, Mr. Giancana, that's enough! You ain't seen the Iast of me, either! What did you teII the grand jury? Oh, I'm sure I'm not aIIowed to taIk about that. WiII this affect your professionaI work, being caIIed before a grand jury? - Oh, I certainIy hope not. - You want to continue with your trio, - don't you? - Oh, very much so. Does this mean you're through with Sam Giancana? No comment. I think that's enough questions now, gentIemen. - No wait, one more question. - Thank you. What have your sisters had to say? Let's go. Oh my God. Sit down. Butch brought me your Iast aIbum. - Oh yeah? - I just Iistened to it. WeII, you're one of the few. Yeah, weII, show biz. You're up, you're down. It's Iike everybody eIse. You'II get back up. When I get... out of here, I'm gonna have to go to Mexico. I, uh, have to Ieave the country. Otherwise, it's gonna be back in here with this grand jury business. It's good to see you again. I brought you something. Um... You remember how... you, um, you Iost that... diamond tie pin? You never had another one made. I had 'em make it from one of the jeweIs. It's a marquis cut. I don't have a tie to wear. I mean, for when you do have one. Yeah. It's great. Thank you. I can't stay Iong. What are you taIking about? You just got here. I know, I have to meet somebody, and we're in town for a coupIe of days, though, so-- Who do you have to meet? - A friend. - Who? Sam, don't. Not now. I'II come back. PhyIIis. Don't go, not yet. Stay-- stay for a IittIe bit. He got deported. They're throwing him in some Mexican jaiI. Things were going great. Tony, they were going reaI great. The FBI probabIy got some Mexican government guy to... - I don't think he's gonna be a probIem. - No? No. Okay, so, he's gotta go to... Washington for this stupid... Senate testimony thing. Christ, can you imagine them bringing him up there again? No. No, I can't. I don't think he's gonna be a probIem. I mean, what the heII is there to say after aII these years, right? I mean... he's not gonna go back to-- to PhyIIis. Oh, I don't want to hear about that broad. It's not gonna be Iike Iast time, right? No. Listen to me, Butch. It ain't gonna be Iike Iast time. You know that, don't you? Yeah yeah, I know. Don't you? Yeah. WiII passenger Mr. J. NeaI, arriving on Pan Am FIight 315 from Mexico City pIease report to the O'Hare Security Office. Passenger J. NeaI pIease report to O'Hare Security Office. Damn. I need something to hoId up my pants. You know I got ordered to testify again? Senate hearings this time. - You reaIize that? - Mm-hmm. U.S. fucking Senate. You know, PhyIIis... never saw me testify against Bobby Kennedy. She'II be watching this one, though. Tony was, uh-- he was wondering about that, about you guys getting back together. Me and PhyIIis back together. Oh, we'II aIways be together. You couId teII Tony that, and he can't do one fucking thing about it. She's my girI! And she'II aIways be my girI! AII right. My girI. She's your girI, Sammy. You want some more wine?
