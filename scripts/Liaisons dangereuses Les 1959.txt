From the Preface to The Dangerous Liasons. Black becomes her. - What's her background? - Aristocratic. She came from the countryside... dressed in ready-to-wear. But she couldn't have been more fully armored. We were all in love with her. She was seen with many men. We all boasted of having had her. But, since we couldn't prove it... our bragging soon stopped. Maybe she's always been virtuous. No one will ever know. Unless he does. - Where did they meet? - At the Political Science Academy. They married just before his graduation. - Is he with the Foreign Ministry? - Yes. He travels a lot. He'll end up heading his father's factories or his mother's bank. Why did she invite us here? To help her husband get a job with the UN Development Program. I thought he ran after women... not after UN committees. Her ambition is enough for them both. Why did she marry him? For money? It must have been more than that. - Who are you talking about? - Our hosts, of course. Valmont and his wife, Juliette. Juliette, you're ignoring me. But I like you a lot. - Your "a lot" hurts my heart. - Oh, you have one? Ever since Valmont introduced you. Be grateful. Hearts are scarce today. - Of course I'm grateful. - And you're flirting with his wife! Skiing with your husband was fun. He's very fast. She warned you against my praise? My cousin is counterattacking! You have a low opinion of me. No. You're a man of high virtue. - Who said that? - Your wife, Juliette. She's your opposite. Faithful, righteous. Excuse me, please. I have great news. My daughter... Elisabeth! Let's get out of here. - You've never wanted revenge? - Why? They're all bored with each other... except for me and Valmont. Wow! The last loyal woman in Paris. And I'm in love with her. A word of advice. Fall in love with Loulou Duchemin. - Lf it's her again... - I know. Sorry, Loulou, Valmont is busy. He's in a meeting. Sure, I'll tell him. Juliette Valmont no longer recognizes Juliette Merteuil? She's not my type. Are you bored? Yes, I am. I thought you and Prevan... He's just a colleague. And the American, Jerry Court? He's no fun anymore. Has the New World... Iost its allure? I mistook him for Tarzan. Have you dropped him? Not yet. I have to find a way. The style of breaking off is what matters. I follow my simple routine: "I picked you up, I had you, good-bye." I believe in using more finesse. Why don't you marry him off? Casanova used to pick husbands for his ex-mistresses. I'd love that! What do you think of Cecile? I'd already thought of her. I've even paved the way a little: "Here is Cecile, a real French girl." Too bad she's so stupid. Even for Court. But if I insist... - He'll agree? - Absolutely. - He's already agreed. - Pardon me? Mrs. Volange broke the news to me. He proposed, she accepted, they're engaged. Cecile and Court will be married in the spring. No kidding! Valmont has revealed the news. You were the matchmaker, my dear. I never expected such an outcome! He's so nice. A new generation boy. Responsive to French charm. He likes France. Yet he claims that American wives are smarter. Most girls in America go to college. - It's not like that here. - In other words, we're stupid? Don't blame him. Unfortunately, few Parisian women are like you. - You barely know the man... - Skin deep... as Valmont puts it. Court's jubilant and full of praise for her: "A perfect, innocent, frank, chaste girl!" What a command of language! She's not with you tonight? She went to a surprise party. A pure girl at a party? We know the family. It's their daughter's 18th birthday. Your letter was wonderful! What are you doing here in the middle of the night? - Really wonderful! - Lf your parents saw you here! Isn't it true what you wrote? Of course it is. But you're still so naive. You don't know what evil is. You wrote so beautifully! I figured that you'd always loved me. At least since our vacation in Baule. You should have told me before. I treated you as a child. The news of your wedding shocked me. I'll never marry Court. Why did you get engaged, then? I want to move out of my house. My parents are so old-fashioned. Do you really love me? Yes, I do. Won't you kiss me? - What's the matter? - You've made progress since Baule. Nice, but too little closet space. There's enough. Not for my outfits! - Your outfits? - Yes, my clothing. - Your clothing here? - We'll live together. You'd move in here? We're in love, aren't we? I've loved you for years, Cecile. I've always thought you'd be my wife. But first, I have to graduate, and I must do my military service. - How long is that? - More than four years. - Another four years? - Lf you really love me... You do, don't you? But four years is too much! Your parents would never let you shack up with a man. Let's get married then. I couldn't support you now. It's complicated, isn't it? What are you doing? Don't you understand? If I became your lover... my parents would give us the money to avoid a scandal. No sex before the wedding! How do you work it? Press the second button. Darling, I'll wait for you as long as you want. But not too long, please. Hello? Yes, Jerry. Sad? Why? I wondered why you didn't come over tonight. He has some news for me. Okay, tomorrow, then. No, I'm not alone. My husband is here. He's kissing me. Of course I'm alone. I was just kidding. Good night, darling. Yes, I'm already in bed. I was just getting undressed. No, I've only taken off my dress. What do you regret? You're so mysterious, tonight. I'll call you later. - Court gets on my nerves. - Does he? You men are all so self-assured! We pick you up... conquer you... but you see yourselves as the conquerors. To make a statement, we have to be the first to break up. Anyway, Court really does annoy me. Because you're no longer in control. Who knows me better than you? Not in the mood? I live by my principles. I won't cheat on my current lover, even with you. Well, you'll be free tonight. How proud he must be! He came, he saw, he conquered. First, a high official's wife introduces him to French love... Finally, he conquers an innocent girl... with a couple of million dollars... Enough to make her a perfect wife. Wait! That's the soft spot! Instead of marrying virtue, he shall marry vice! She's different from you. But young enough to be molded. The way you molded me. Which of us molded the other? Here's my plan. The Volanges vacation in Megeve. You'll go, too. - I'm going to Switzerland. - Snow is the same everywhere. Do me this little favor. Use your charm to seduce Cecile. But she's my cousin. And I'm your wife. I'm making you a nice gift. She's 17, a little awkward, but promising. I should thank you. She'll learn the tricks of the trade. He'll introduce her to his friends as a young innocent. But they'll find out in bed that she's Valmont's trainee. Everyone will die laughing. - Will you go? - I can't say no to you. Me neither. You're awful. That guy's wonderful! I saw him zoom down the slope this morning. Oh, my God! It's my cousin! Hey, Valmont! - You didn't recognize me? - Kiss first... Cecile! You've learned how to ski? I saw you going downhill. Not bad. But watch your arms. They're like a windmill! - May I have a sausage? - It's not our table. - Who cares? - All right, then. Don't turn around. Guess who's here. Your wife? Who'd disapprove of my company? Disapprove? Your mother. - Would she? Why? - I wonder myself. Not in Switzerland, Valmont? I arrived last night. I have the hotel room next to yours. Juliette chose Megeve, then? No. She's in Paris, catching up on her sleep. Won't she join us? Yes. For the New Year's party. Which beauty attracted you here? It's still a secret. I thought you were indiscreet. People flatter me. I'll give you the victim's name after she surrenders. I'll figure it out. I know you very well. This time, though, it'll be hard to guess. Excuse me. The snow is too good to miss. You might have introduced us, don't you think? May I have my mail, please? Good morning. - A letter for you? - Not really... - What are you holding then? - Well, a letter. But it's an error. It's for you. Yes, indeed. Thank you. See you. I've got to run! Come see me at the terrace. - Be careful, my dear! - I'll be okay. So, princess, some time today... - Someone's in a tight corner! - Brutes aren't my type. And you, miss? Could you love one? - She's an introvert. - No, she's English. Thanks. I appreciate that. - What if your mother had seen it? - A drama. - As serious as that? - It's a letter from my fiance. Why should she object, then? It's from my other fiance. - You have two? - Yes. True and false? But the false one is true. - Who's the false one that is true? - Danceny. Young Danceny? Yes. I love him. What did Valmont tell you? That's our secret. A secret? A love secret. Let's break something! See you in the hospital! Poor guy. Need any help? No, I'm fine. "I stopped briefing you on my mission... "because of an unexpected twist. "The day after I arrived, I met an adversary worthy of myself. "She embodies faithfulness, modesty, and purity. "Virtue, actually. "Her name is Marianne. "She's married to a young civil servant... "who's now attending a conference abroad. "She's originally Danish. "Her accent, slips of the tongue, and simplicity have enchanted me. "Winter sports facilitate acquaintances. "I also met the rest of her family... "her husband's aunt... "and Marianne's daughter, Caroline. "Emotions work miracles. "For the first time, I looked at a child... "with a parent's eye... "envying the real father. "Their budget is modest. "They're staying in a little mountain house. "I launched an immediate attack." - Mrs. Tourvel? These are for you. - Thank you. Valmont is sending this. For you... For me... and for Caroline. Nobody's sent me flowers for a long time. Here, sweetheart. Your first rose ever from a man. That man looked sad. Not to me. You didn't notice. - Didn't he tell you about himself? - No. Good. Men do that to excess. A postman... A woman, widowed or divorced... - Slander... - Who'd slander me? It's in the cards. So, tell me about slander. "Marianne loves her husband. "She's a faithful and happy wife. "So far I've only dealt with easy women. "My regular weapon may turn against me this time. "But no fortress is impregnable. "You can only fail as an attacker. "But I will triumph. "I know how to win over Mrs. Rosemonde. "It pays to have friends in the enemy camp." Worse and worse. Trouble, and a trial... A trial? Do you know how to calculate rents? I own a small house in Paris. Two more cards, please. I must have made a mistake in my figures. I may get in trouble. It's troublesome, an house. Marianne, I told you to say "a" house. An inn... an alley... an chapel. "A" chapel! "I avoided words or gestures which would have put her on her guard. "The word 'Iove' in particular. "Just 'friends, ' and nothing more. "But that's tricky for a seducer. "I had to find a unique solution. "Virtue is best conquered with the truth. "I decided to cast off my mask... "and tell her about my conquests." Why are you telling me all this? I don't know. I liked you better before. So I've lost. I told myself, "If she knows me as I am... "and still doesn't lose hope... "she may be able to help me." You have a wife. Only she can help. "I told her all about us. "Our pact to hide nothing from each other... "to try everything. "Never to be trapped into falling in love. "Cold blood, no sentimentality. "I concealed nothing, curious to know her reaction. "But I didn't see her face. "It must have been beautiful. Anguished and tormented. " In love, we only seek pleasure. The ultimate pleasure. Until it provokes sadness. You think it's over... but it's not! You can go further... and further. You reach a state... verging on delirium. Is it still pleasure... or already suffering? In the end, there's just anguish. I'm scared. I feel an urge to talk about it. With you, Marianne, so sincere... so righteous... Marianne. "Dear Juliette, I've never wanted any woman as much as her. " Are you afraid? Yes. Happiness is so simple. Look at me, please. Even if it's for the last time. "I'm sure she will see me again. "She'll feel remorse... "and I won't assuage it. "She believes in chastity, but will sacrifice it for me. "Good-bye, my dear friend. "My gratitude to women of easy virtue... "makes me your humble servant. Valmont." Plenty of snow at Megeve? That showoff may break his neck. - He ran into a tree? - Threw himself onto an ice rock. Just minor scratches. Who should I meet with in New York? - Do you want that post for Valmont? - Anything to make him happy. The British won't welcome a Frenchman. Play the Scandinavian card. All right. Your determination is impressive. Won't you ever get any scratches? No liaison is ever too dangerous for me. Invite all your friends. I've reserved three tables for tomorrow night. You do things in a big way. No, the tables are tiny. - Juliette! What a surprise! - Hello. I love your fur coat. Be our guests tomorrow night. If Valmont's free. Room 24, please. My name's Valmont. My husband has made a reservation for me. Certainly. I'll have your bags brought up. I owe you an explanation. Don't bother. The explanation is charming. Congratulations. I should have... French people never forget to send the elevator back down. How well you know our customs! You're not offended, are you? No. I have a wedding gift for you. You're a smart lady. I knew that. I have a problem with my fiance. - Which one of them? - The real one. Danceny. - Is he coming as well? - He's sent me a present. - That's nice. - But complicated. Why? It's a tape with his voice. I'm to listen to it on New Year's Eve. How thoughtful. - But I don't have a tape recorder. - I'll get you one. Thanks. But my mom or my fiance are always around. I'll bring it tonight. Don't lock your door. - You'll bring it tonight? - You'll listen in peace. - I'm angry. - Why? I'd rather celebrate with you. I'm sitting with Court and Cecile. Bring Marianne over. After what I confessed? Exactly. You chose the truth to be your weapon. Go on fighting then. You told her about me so introduce me. You think it'll work out? All of us together? Court between me and Cecile... you between Cecile and Marianne. Under Volange's supervision. One big happy family! Remember, you promised something. - Cecile? It will be easy. - When? Tonight. I'm taking her a tape recorder. She'll go back to her room around 10:30. She'll leave her door unlocked for me. At her age, one gets sleepy early. Around midnight, tired of waiting... she'll be in bed, fast asleep. Good night. - You look tired. - No, I'm okay. What are you doing here? - I've brought you a tape recorder. - I thought you weren't coming. Not now. It's too late. What? Don't act like a spoiled child. I spent the whole afternoon looking for this thing. Don't treat me like I'm some idiot! Where's the tape? I'm sorry. I forgive you. You put the reel here, and the tape there... You set it turning, and there it is! Press the button. My dearest Cecile... A recorded voice carries at night. We'll smother the sound. Turn it on now. It's me, your crazy mathematician. I've never dared tell you many things. But when I see you in all your femininity... I'm so delighted and awestruck... that I only manage to grouch and moralize. Actually, I keep asking myself: "How can she love me?" It's unbelievable! It's marvelous. Very nice. My pure Cecile! A man in love has dreadful secret thoughts. How many times I've undressed you in my mind! Get out of here! It would be rude of me to do that. - I'll scream! - Go ahead. Explain the open door... the tape recorder... Danceny's tape. If you cause a scandal... there will be no Court, no Danceny... no husband at all. - You won't leave? - No. - Then I will. - Where? To your mother? I hate you. - Do you really? - Yes. That's how love often begins. I don't love you. I'm crying. Are you? You're crying? Almost. Stay if you want. I'll sleep in the armchair. Everybody treats you like a little girl. Your fiance, your mother... even Danceny. Don't you want to be a woman? But I don't love you. Are you certain? At your age... one imagines that love comes suddenly... like a disease. That isn't true. You've got to help Mother Nature. Thanks. I don't need your help. You aren't a gentleman. Leave me alone, Valmont. If you let me kiss you. No. No? Yes. You won't keep your promise? That wasn't a kiss. Luxembourg Radio. And now, Name That Tune! A Jacques Benetin presentation... of a Jacques Antoine program, brought to you by... Duff Shampoo! Skiing can tire you out. I remember my first somersaults... Excuse me, it's my nerves. I'll take a nap now to prepare for this evening. - Your dark circles are sexy. - Leave me alone. What a storm! My taxi got stuck twice. It took some courage to come. I didn't expect it to be this bad. How will you get back? No chance for a cab tonight. I'll have to find a room. Everything's full in town. - I'll take care of it. - Thank you. I'll just touch up my hair. I'll try and find a room for you. The Mont Blanc Hotel? Valmont speaking. Just a moment, please. Could you move my things from Room 19 to my wife's? Yes. My friend, Mrs. Tourvel, will sleep in my room tonight. That's right. Very good. Thank you. You're lucky. Someone hasn't arrived. You'll get Room 19. I didn't know you shared a table with Mrs. Volange. Me neither. My wife came unexpectedly. I hope you don't mind. No, why? Let's dance. First take this off. Mrs. Tourvel, my wife. Nice to meet you. How was your trip? I hate trains, so I came by car. I had promised my husband. I don't drink. After your "expedition," you need it. Here, drink. You found a room? Yes, at the Mont Blanc. Valmont always gets what he wants. On which floor? I don't know. It's Room 19. Shall we dance? I'm not in the mood. Come on. I promise to be amusing. Valmont is very attracted to her. I've noticed. You should react. His sincerity and trust are all I have. Eskimo Ice Cream! Anybody for Eskimo Ice Cream? - Eskimo Ice Cream? - Would you like some, sir? - How much is that? - 800 francs. Keep the change. No, let's go back to our table. What did you tell your wife about me? Virtuous women don't interest her. Midnight... Midnight, Marianne. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. His wife must love him a lot. But his first kiss was for you. Thank you for coming. You clown. I'm never a clown in front of you. I open up only to you. It's our eleventh New Year. Almost all our friends are divorced. We know how to love each other. He only enjoys depraving others. I know. He told me about it. He's stronger than I thought. He knows he'll never seduce me. Come on. He wants you and nothing else matters. - You know it. - No. They had no rooms at the Mont Blanc. - And Room 19? - It's his. He had his things moved out. Because of friendship, of course. King of the Charleston! - Aren't you tired, Cecile? - No. Let's stay a while. - Having fun, Court? - It's marvelous. I'm so sleepy. May I ask you to excuse me? Sure. I like you a lot, Marianne. Please leave me alone. Why did you escape? I didn't. Go now. Not before you explain. You're in your own room, but I still insist you leave. I see. There are no vacant rooms. I gave you mine. Is that a crime? You lied to me. Get out. - Will I see you tomorrow? - No. - When then? - Never. I love you. You made me say it. I didn't want you to know. I was afraid to hurt our friendship, the only honest thing in my life. You made me change. You have no right to kick me out. I ask only this... allow me to see you occasionally. You'll never see me again. Don't pretend I mean nothing to you. Leave me alone. Go away. Do you hear me? Get out! Congratulations. For what? Is she also useless in bed? As gauche as ever? I don't know yet. You mean that half-drunk and in love with you, she still resisted? You didn't take advantage? She was hysterical. But I did not want to do something... she did not want. I want her to give herself to me willingly. - The same result. - No. Let me see her defend herself... and slowly lose ground. And become like any other woman. Pray for her that she won't give in. Are you jealous? Just calculating. We're people of honor, Valmont. We don't allow untruths, so destructive for other couples. I didn't lie to you. You love that woman. Like a kid, a man, you name it. It's an accident. You'll shake it off. Be honest with yourself and with me. You love her. There's only one woman whom I love and respect. My confidant... and accomplice... you. Prove it then. Tell me how. Don't lose more time. Seduce her. Then drop her in your usual manner... without emotion. How much time do I have? Before I come back from New York, I want a complete report. You'll have it. I adore you. Cecile, it's me Valmont. Don't bother me. What's the matter with everybody? A nightmare? Where am I? Oh, my God... - All right, I'm going. - Where? To wake up Marianne. Duty first. I've just seen her leave. Escape, you mean? - That'll cost her dearly. - Cecile will comfort you. - She locked the door. - You didn't wake her up? - She didn't let me in. - That little vixen. - Twinges of conscience. - Wise after the event. Young people have no morals. I'll teach her a lesson. - Who's there? - Juliette. Come in. You're angry with Valmont. - What happened? - Nothing. Last night meant nothing. You know? Everything. I swear it wasn't my fault. He was pressing me. You should have defended yourself. Easy to say. I have no experience. Other men aren't like Valmont. Are you very angry? - Do I look angry? - No. Tell me... was it really so unpleasant? I don't love him. I love Danceny. But you acted like you loved him. I'm ashamed. I cried. In love, you're only ashamed once. It's for Danceny. Instead of becoming wiser, you're sillier. Go ahead and cry. I feel that I love you as well. It's awful to love so many people. We're all like that. You'll get used to it. But men despise easy women. If Court found out... he wouldn't marry you. I don't care. Danceny wouldn't either. I wanted to do it with Danceny. But he respects me. How complicated. Why do we need men at all? We can't help it, I'm afraid. Face the truth squarely. You can love Danceny with your heart... and Valmont... like the other night. Danceny will continue respecting you... and everyone will be happy. When you say that, it seems easy. But you made a mistake. To make love to a man and then shut the door in his face? It's bad manners, and dangerous. He may get furious and tell everyone. You think so? The man takes the lead, the woman follows. - Think of your reputation. - Yes. Have fun and be good. Call me tomorrow. Relax. Concentrate on your mission. I spoke with Cecile. She'll be as docile as befits her age. You're the best. - Good luck in New York. Come back! - In 10 days or so. That wasn't part of your plan. - Why don't you run after her? - Lf she's fleeing, that proves she loves me. In Paris she'll collect herself. Just the opposite. Distance makes the heart grow fonder. We'll see. Meanwhile, dear cousin, would you care for a game of bridge? I have many ways of amusing myself. No, Valmont, you're mistaken. I'm sorry. Marianne isn't here. But I've called six times already. I'm sure you're not telling me the truth. What's going on? What did I do to deserve this? All right, I'll be frank. You're intelligent and sensitive enough to comprehend. Marianne is married. Her husband is still away. Your company could compromise her. So she won't see you anymore. And she's correct. Please do not insist. Don't write to her either. - Please, help me solve this. - I have my own problems. Are you good at geometry? I don't understand it at all. What is it? How do I find the slope? Let me see. It's easy. You cut your line by a vertical. Pen, please. What is the shortest distance between two points? A straight line. What a fool I've been. The shortest distance is by train! I'll go straight to her. "I defeated her. "That astounding woman who thought she'd resist me. "She's mine. "All mine. "She gave me everything. "Let me tell you how I did it. "I knew exactly when she'd be home alone. "I rang the bell... "and she opened the door." No need to kick me out. I've just come to say good-bye. I'm leaving Paris for five years. I asked for a post 7,000 miles from here... I'm being sent to the island of Reunion. That's crazy. You're out of your mind. To live in the same city as you... to breathe the same air, walk the same streets... to know that you are... so close... and not to be able to see you again... That was too much to bear. I had to do something... Anything. To abandon your job and wife? That doesn't matter anymore. You may still change your mind. No. I'm leaving this month. But let me clear my name first. I'm leaving France... because I have no hope you'll ever forgive me for hurting you. "I wasn't wasting time. "As I talked, I surveyed the lay of the land. "I picked a red sofa. "There was another one, more comfortable, but facing her husband's picture... "so I decided against it." I don't want your life ruined. What life? Emptiness. Disgust. You made me realize that. Take a hold of yourself, start over... Not without you. Only you'd give me the courage. I'm thoroughly unhappy, Marianne. "At this point, I was hoping to impress her with my tears. "But whether I was too tired or too focused on my speech... "I couldn't bring myself to cry. "Fortunately, I remembered your confessions and teachings. "'Men, ' you would say... "'are seldom equal to the emotions they inspire in women. "'Women feel very sublime when they're about to surrender. "'But men, for fear of ridicule... "'don't dare to speak up. ' "I went for pathos. "To stand up to virtue you must suppress your own self. " I'm like a child, Marianne. I don't know how to live. It's impossible without you. Don't say so. It's cruel. "For my attack, I chose the theme 'to have you or to die. ' "Women imagine that their repudiated suitors would throw themselves... "under a train for them. "On the other hand, men who talk about suicide hardly ever commit it. "I chose to merely hint at my intention. "She figured it would be a more serious crime to let me go... "than to give way to our passion. "Yet she realized she was sacrificing... "the trust and respect of her husband, family and friends. "Her decent and happy existence. "Her faith in God. "And perhaps her child as well." I've already said too much. I wish you happiness, Marianne. Always. It's all that matters to me. "I decided to take chances. "I gently bade her farewell... "but took advantage of her nervousness to kiss her hands. " Good-bye, Marianne. I should let you leave, but I can't. I can't. Go away. I don't want you to be unhappy. I can't stand it. I beg you, leave me alone. Promise you'll forget about me. Please don't cry. Marianne, I'm so happy. I'd give my life if it would be of any service to you. "Togetherness intoxicated us both. "For me, like never before, it was more overwhelming than desire. "I let her hold me tight. "Then sank to my knees and vowed that I'd love her forever. "And I really meant it. "We decided to spend a few days at a hotel in Normandy. "Juliette, why aren't you in Paris? "I look forward to your return. "Bye, my angel. I give you all my love." - Who's there? - Miss Volange. Take care of her baggage. - How long since Mr. Valmont left? - A week, madam. - Hasn't he called? - No. I knew you'd be back this morning. I need your help urgently. - How? - I have to get married. - You're engaged, aren't you? - I must get married right away. - Really? - Yes, I'm positive. It can't be urgent. You're marrying Court in April. So he'll be a happy father soon. I want to marry Danceny. I'll try to explain to him... That you're pregnant by Valmont? I tried persuading him to marry me. In vain. I begged, I threatened, but he just got upset. He's so serious. Maybe it's his way of loving me. Or you used the wrong arguments. You'd be able to get through to him. Perhaps. Please! It's him. Thank you. I'm Cecile's cousin. - Juliette Valmont. - Nice to meet you. Cecile told me a lot about you. Let's talk about you and her. You're going to the same university? - The entrance exam is in June. - How exciting. - Do you have an apartment? - I'm renting a room. Mansard, I suppose? Complete with a handy blackboard? - You must love mathematics. - It's my passion. - And Cecile? - Come on! Cecile and mathematics. It must be depressing, alone all the time. Even at home. I'm not rushing into marriage, but Cecile won't wait. What are your plans? Work in the private sector? - Research work. - That won't make you rich. - I don't care. - That's unusual for a young man. Few women understand that. You know women well? I mean Cecile. She has no right to interfere with your career. Tell her that. I don't want to hurt her. If she loves you, she'll wait. Don't try to see each other for the moment. I'll take care of it. You just concentrate on your equations. You'll tell me how things go? Come and see me at 7, day after tomorrow. Okay. - Do you like whiskey? - I haven't acquired the taste. It's the healthiest liquor. Come here, you cute little dolphin! Come here! What do doctors do to angels with stuffy noses? They send them to heaven. No. The opposite. They forbid them to make love. That's not true. Do you love me? Yes. My body is no longer the same. Your eyes make a difference. Yes? Mr. Valmont, a telephone call for you. Okay. Won't you kiss me first? Do you really love me? Of course, I'll be there. The ministry, I got my assignment. At Reunion? That was before you loved me. No, I've been trying to get on IBABC for a long time. It's very important for me. That's wonderful? What is IBABC? Everyone knows... The International Bureau for Aid to Backward Countries. Where is it? It has offices everywhere. Where's my notebook? On the table. - So what about us? - Nothing will change. What about our plans? The house in Marly... the rose garden... the little dog? Does it matter where we love each other? I'm frightened. I love that fear of yours. What are you thinking about? The minister wants to see me. I have to go to Paris in the morning. I'll be back in the evening. We'll spend a few more days here. Then we're off for the IBABC trip. Look at the itinerary. April in Tokyo. Cherry trees in bloom. You'll wear a printed dress. June in Nairobi. A safari. I'll shoot only with my camera. September in Calcutta. Monsoon... fever, malaria... Take it easy. It won't be that bad. Here's to your mission! April in Tokyo. It is very delicate. You must go with me, Prevan. June in Nairobi. Easy stopover. We'll hunt lions. September in Calcutta. I'll need an economic advisor. You helped me a lot. Thanks. I must be at the ministry at 8:00. Your mail is on the desk. - You know the way, don't you? - By heart. How did Mrs. Tourvel take Operation Breakup? She's waiting for me in Deauville. You didn't keep your word? I don't know how to tell her. - I can't stand tears. - Phone her. - I'll hear her crying. - Telegraph. What can you explain in a telegram? What you usually say straight out. I can do it for you. I want to send a telegram. Babylon, 32-82. It's from Mr. Valmont. Mrs. Tourvel... Royal Inn, Deauville. "My sweet angel... "everything has its end... "That's the law of nature. "I seduced you with pleasure. "I'm leaving you without regret. "Good-bye. "That's the way life goes. "It's not my fault. Valmont." I repeat... Okay, thank you. Are you pleased with yourself? How long will it take? About two hours. And if it's urgent? One hour? Make it urgent then. No, Henri, that's impossible. You've been a very good husband. Do me one last favor then, please. Leave me Caroline. A telegram for you. Executed. Suffering? It's none of your business. That's vanity for you. You're madly in love with her. I made fun of you... and you sacrificed her. As if you were doing something heroic. Already at Miguel's? I'll be late. My husband needed me. Definitely. See you in an hour. Till then, Danceny. Yes. Well-behaved, charming. He wouldn't hurt a woman out of self-love. Danceny knows Miguel? There's a lot he can tell him. I'm in control. I won't tolerate this liaison. On my return from New York, Cecile came to me in tears. You did it... but you forgot to take precautions. Poor girl. Bleeding heart. I'm glad your blood will refine Court's progeny. Cecile wanted to marry Danceny. She asked me to persuade him. I persuaded him to do something else. He won't marry till he graduates. Cecile is furious. But Danceny adores me. What shall I wear for this get-together? What do you think? You won't see Danceny! Is that clear? The Valmont I loved was a gentleman. Mrs. Tourvel gave me back a husband. A husband has rights! You'll stay here tonight! All your life, if I say so! Could you leave my bedroom, please? I must change. Our friends await me. As you wish. But let me warn you. If you see him now... there will be war. Okay. Let there be war. Hello, Miguel. Hi. - The party's warming up. - Yes. - You're well? - Yes. I hope Danceny will understand. Sure, you love each other. But what about Juliette? Just do as I told you. Hello. You don't remember me? I'm Valmont. I sure do. Sorry. I want you to listen to me carefully. - It's a matter of honor. - I'm listening. I love a woman who is not my wife. Juliette followed us to Megeve and created quiet a stir. That's true, I was there. When Juliette came to Paris I was away with the other one. On January 12, Cecile visited her cousin Juliette. Why? I sought help to make you marry me. What did she tell you? That a student shouldn't marry. Talk it all out, together. Why did she do that? She wanted to make Valmont jealous so as to get back at him. Not too original. You're suffering? That's vanity for you! He sacrificed you with true heroism. I don't try to be witty... I get even. Long distance, please. Deauville. Yes, I'll hold. The Royal Inn? May I speak to... What's the name again? Hello! - I'll take you home now. - But I'm having too much fun. We don't want problems with your parents now, do we? So it's you again? Valmont was right. You won't give up. I don't feel like talking. Read this. Read it. It's a letter from Valmont, written to New York in January. A detailed account of winter nights spent with Cecile. Quiet interesting from the technical point of view. Good style. He has talent. Don't you think? You're even worse than he is. It's over! Where's my scarf? You wrote this letter? Yes, young man. My scarf... You bastard! - Me? I'm a gentleman. - I'll break your face. I've been kind to my wife, doing what she asked me to do. Kind to you also, substituting for you with Cecile. And kind to Cecile, finding a father for our child. Jealous Student Kills Diplomat My poor baby, I thought I'd be the one to tell you. But you already know. What are you doing, Marianne? I packed his suitcase. He'll have a surprise. I'll be all set when he comes. But he's dead. He rented a little house... with lots of flowers, roses. Many roses... And there's a little dog. We'll go by ship. It's on an island. It's a pretty name. "Reunion." She'll be right here, Inspector. Help! Leave her alone! She's still a child! Look at her. Her face is the image of her soul. THE END
