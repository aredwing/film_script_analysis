Did you know that more dinosaur fossils are discovered... in our tar pits than anywhere else in the world. If you ever want to come here, I'm an awesome tour guide! Sorry, Mr Hodges. Ernie Fitzpatrick! How dare you! Hi sis, how was soccer practice? Mom's gonna be so mad at you, again! You know you're supposed to be watching the store. Here's a quarter, Jules. Call someone who cares! If you can find a pay phone. Hahaha... She's kinda right about my mom though. Her head would explode if she saw me. But I'm not too worried. Mom's busy getting ready for some PTA awards ceremony. The most important part of being a parent is setting rules. Thank you for this award. Ernie, are you on your way? Ya, I just stopped to let Julia borrow some money. Okay, I'm leaving now. So I'm gonna put out the Back in 15 minutes sign for you. - What do I always say, Ernie? - Leave a note. So, 15 minutes gives you until 2:53 sharp, Okay? Yup, got it! I know my mom means well, but she's always watching me. I never get a second of freedom. Hello? - Ernie are you at the store yet? - Getting there. Okay, well, don't dawdle just go as fast as you can. "Back in 15 minutes". Okay Mom. " Back in 150 minutes". You heard her, she said as fast as I can. Ah... Terra Dino Natural History Museum. Only the most excellent place on earth. And this is Mystery Rock. See that carving, it's been dated all the way back to the Cretaceous period. Which is weird, cause who could have carved it? No humans were around 145 million years ago. Just dinosaurs. Mysterious hah? Right, that's where we got the name. Give it back. That's my best friend Max! He's way cooler than he thinks he is... which is what makes him so cool. But, sometimes the other kids don't see that. Do you think Leonardo da Vinci got picked on as a kid? What? Dude? Look, something shiney. What? But where? Back there. Suckers! Hahaha... Ernie, how is the rocket board? On a scale of 1 to 10... 37, baby! Buuyaa!! You and your dad totally outdid yourselves on this one. Hey, speaking of my Dad... He found new fossil samples at digs 23 and 29. They're doing the formal unveiling tomorrow. Too cool! A new exhibit, awesome! I can't wait. Wait... But the exhibit isn't open. And weren't you supposed to be helping out at your mom's shop. Dude... You sound like my mom with all her do this do that stuff. Don't' you know breaking the rules is the most important part of being a kid. The most important part of being a parent is setting rules. Once you set rules... the key is making sure they're followed exactly the way you want. I do everything she wants me to, just not exactly the way she wants me to. It's a compromise. No compromises. A good goal is to make observance of the rules a family project. That of course doesn't mean I endorse tattling. Ready to begin. Operation massively busted! Oh, the beauty of ancient history... This is Gallimimus. He can run up to 20 miles per hour. 25 miles per hour, dude. Read a book much! That of course was the super juvenile pain-in-the-neck-asaurus. Okay, moving on. Uhuh. Often kids think they know more than adults. They don't know more than adults. Authorized Personnel Only. - We can't. - Oh, but we must. Keep a look out! This looks complicated. We'll need a variable algorithm to sort combination possibilities. What about the possibility it isn't locked? Buuyaa!! Buuyaa.. I wonder if I'll like prison food. Tyrannosaurus! The vicious blood-thirsty killer. Attacking totally without mercy! It's just a statue Max, totally nonthreatening, here we go. Constant vigilance. That's the biggy. If we let our guard down for one minute... who knows what kind of trouble our kids might get into. Hey, Max look. This must be it. Yeah, but it's covered up. Too bad. Let's get out of here. I didn't sneak all the way in here to see a giant bed sheet! Come on, let's pull it off. - I don't know Ernie... - I'll get this corner, you get that one. Careful! - Hey, what's the deal? - Infra red motion detector. - Oooh... - Wait... Watch this! And I'm really going in. Ernie, I totally want to be you before I grow up! Oh yeah... Okay now. One, two, three! - On a scale of 900... - No offense to the rocket board! None taken. Sarcosuchus. I sure wouldn' want to meet him in a dark alley! With teeth like that I wouldn't want to meet him anywhere. You fooled mom for the last time, Ernie. Humf. Here's your quarter. Better call a lawyer. Secure the area! Stay frosty boys! I smell spies from Science Museum. Let's ride! Seal the perimeter! Okay. Scale of 1 to 10? Minus 50! You just try to ride this thing when you can't see where you're going. Chillax Max. I've got this place totally memorized. I've got him! I've got him! We're doing it? I can't believe you doubted me, Max, I'm a little hurt. Service exit on the left. I don't think so. Thank you for this award. Come back you little... Oh, now let me direct your attention to the boy-are-they-in-trouble-asauruses. Okay... Can I just point out that technically I didn't disobey you? Ernie... You said go to the store after school and I stopped by. There's proof, I left a note. Back in 150 Minutes- Yeah... see, I didn't disobey you, I just took a brief educational detour. You did disobey, and you know it. Plus, the museum was damaged. Their display was disrupted. I know Mom, I'm sorry. Your actions affect other people Ernie, you have to learn that. I have to be able to count on you, and someday others will too. I just really wanted to see those bones. They're fossils honey, they've been around for millions of years. They're not going anywhere! - Now I'm grounding you for three weeks. - Mom... It's my rule, Ernie. And no compromising. Now, go to your room, and close the door until I call you for dinner. Huh.. Hmh, mother of the year, haa.. Nobody asked for my vote. Can't you make your own life interesting instead of always butting-in on mine. Three weeks? That's more than you've ever gotten! I wouldn't have gotten anything if that alarm hadn't gone off. And I know for a fact Max and I... Tada... Haaa... - You! - Me what? You are gonna pay for this! Enjoy your three weeks of house arrest! It's not fair. Haa.. It never ends. Time to go to the store, Ernie. Time for violin practice, Ernie. Time to clean your room, Ernie. Uuhh... How about some Ernie time. When can I make my own rules? There's an open window right next to me. Any other time I wouldn't think twice. I can't. I won't. But I must! It's unbelievable! Max, open up! I'm coming. Still a few bugs in my Dad's new door opener. You think. Ouch... Your mom didn't... Your mom didn't punish you? No. Stop it! Stop it! Yeah, she grounded me for three weeks. And yet you're here? How bout your Dad? He says I have to help him in the garage after school for a month. Huh, like I mind! Man, who would? No, Ernie's mom doesn't let him have soda. Ernie's mom isn't here. Hehe... Did your garage get bigger? Yeah. We sold the car to make room for more experiments. Dad! Ernie's here. Back here! Hey Dr. Santiago, how's the time machine coming along? Four years and still doesn't work. For a long time, I thought the power key wasn't connected right. Now I'm pretty sure it's in the control panel, let's see. Chrono stream relay, calibrated. Matter transferal gage, operational. Ah, I just don't know. You'll get it, Dad. We'll get it! You know the vacuuming robot? I'll bet I can re-purpose it's capacitors for the time machine's power bypass. The time when I could make my own rules? On a scale of 1 to 10... - You can't count that high. - No doubt! Sneaking out and drinking a soda. Double busted! You're tattling twerp! Three weeks is nothing, I've got enough pictures here to get you grounded for three years. Dude! Be carefull! Some of this stuff even my Dad doesn't know what to do! - Give me that phone. - Get away! I didn't do it! Sneaking out, drinking a soda... and wrecking Dr Santiago's machine. Ernie, you are triple busted! So this is my fault? I don't think so! You come along and suddenly the fun... stopped. Maybe construction down the street? What was that? Max, do you have a pitbull you never told me about? This is majorly weird. Okay, nobody flip, I'm sure the control panel just freaked out. Julia, are you okay? - Is it still there? - Yeah, but... she doesn't look like she wants to hurt us. She almost looks like... she's smiling? Great! Then she won't mind if we go home. That's the real T-Rex. Man, I gotta check this out! Ernie! Way out! Don't worry, she's not even trying to catch me. Maybe, but you can take our heads off with her tail. Relax. Can't you see how cool this is? Ernie, she might eat us if we don't get out of here now. I think... the museum did a really great job with this new display. Very life like. Aahh... It's real... This is so real? She cleaned him, like a newborn. It makes sense. The time machine kinda looks like an egg when it's all folded up. Make sense? Hello... Do we look like baby dinosaurs? She wasn't calling everyone to dinner, was she? No, she was calling every one to look at her cute little babies. It almost sounds like they're talking to each other, doesn't it? We are so happy for you Tyra. Yeah, it was looking like that egg of yours was never gonna hatch. The way you've been like a mother to orphans for all these years is so wonderful Tyra. But you deserve children of your own. You still look after us though, right? I mean, we don't want the Sarco's sneaking up on us when we're grazing or anything. Shhh, come on Neo, don't worry. I'm not going anywhere. All of you are my family. I'll protect you from the Sarco Brothers and... then when my babies are big enough, they'll protect you too. - What do we have here? - Any stragglers? I'm starving. What is wrong with you? Are you out of mind? Are you looking to get extinct? She gonna hurt you! Sshh... There's something going on here... What are you looking at? It wasn't me. I didn't let loose a stink or anything! I swear! Is that right! Then how come all of sudden, it smells like a sulfur pit around here, tell me that! I think it's smells kind of nice. Can you shut up! Will you? The Sarco's want to know anything and everything about Tyra. Ooh... The plot thickens! Well they're definitely going to want to hear about this. Yeah, definitely. Shush... - Aarrgh... - Sshh... Aaaarrhh... Amateurs! If they're not belching they're squawking, if they're not squawking they're stepping on things! They are as weird looking as orphan is. They are beautiful and they'll grow up big and strong like their mother. Now everyone shuuh, my babies need their sleep. Now shuuh. Alright, alright. Now's our chance. Jules, come on, we'll just stay for a little while. We can set the time machine to bring us back right after we left... and mom will never know we were gone. We won't get in any trouble. This isn't about getting away with something Ernie. It's about going back where we belong. Max, how do you get this to work? Let's see. Well... First, you run the initialization sequence... But, the initialization sequence won't even run, because the power key is gone. What if it fell off when we were going back in time. It could be anywhere or any when? I'll give it to them later, okay? I mean, Dino Mom thinks we're her kids and it would be rude to just leave, right? Don't worry, Jules... I'm sure it must just fallen off somewhere around here... while we are coming in for a landing. We'll find it, in a day or two. Ernie, we're stuck here. Everything's gonna be fine. Look around Jules... This is Terra Dino at the peak of the Cretaceous period. And? And that's totally awesome! This is our town. Millions of years before we were ever born. Look, there's Mystery Rock! And if this nest is near Max's garage then we're probably really close to... home. Ernie? It's time for dinner. Come on, Ernie. I know you're upset with me but you can at least answer your door. Oohh... Julia, did you see where your bro... "Gone to bust Ernie." Okay, just a matter of figuring out where Ernie would go.. He went where he always goes. Just a minute. Hey, Sue... Holla! Hello Dr Santiago... Oh please, I wish you'd call me Diego... Could you come down from there? Yeah, sorry. I'm still working out a few kinks in my robot's arms and things. Sorry. - Is Ernie here? - Yup, he and Max are in the garage. I think Julia is here too. They're looking at the time machine. Time machine? Okay, while she's busy let's go exploring... for the power key. Come on! Ernie, if you get eaten, I'll still tell mom. Do whatever, I'm having fun! Um... Hi, Mom... Mommy... Can I go out? Ahhhh... See, you're not supposed to go anywhere. There is a way around any Mom, it's just a matter of finding it. Oh yaah. What is it? Looky... Your big brother brought presents. Let me see, where are they? Where are they? Orphan. Oh congrats Mom, triplets huh. I need to see them. I need to see them. Where are they? There they are? Ooh, they're different colors, they're different colors. Aaagh.. I got siblings, I finally got siblings. You know, someone to play hide and go eat with. Hey, and on long trips, you know, to fight over who will sit on Mom's hump. It will never be me of course. And we'll sing the same songs over and over, mostly the songs I like. And for the rest of our lives we'll love each other as friends. You know, for ever and ever! One question! Why do they look so weird? What kind of dinosaur is that? No clue, but it's not a T-Rex. Yeah, no harm done really. The security guard just has to get... new pants. Well, that's not what I'm angry about it. What is that? Hey... Its' not the kids, nor the time machine... So... what is it? It's a dinosaur egg, if I'm not mistaken... a T-Rex! Excuse me... There's an egg from the Cretaceous period in my garage... that means matter transferal must have taken place. That's mean somehow the kids must have gotten my time machine to work. Excuse me? They've gone back millions of years in the past. Excuse me? Hah... - Don't panic Sue... - What exactly are you saying? - I really hate this place. - Will you shut up! Mr Sarco, Mr Other Sarco! We're back. Your prodigal henchmen have returned. Mr Sarco, Mr Other Sarco. - Ah, there you are. - Looking good. What took you idiots so long? They were out there goofing around. Let's eat them now. Before they goof the meat off their bones. Don't eat me, I'm mostly fat. If we don't relocate soon, we won't have a choice. With all the earthquakes and rising tar, the pickins are getting slim down here, soon. Soon, nothing in the lower valley will survive. When we get rid of Tyra the upper valley is ours for the taking. We need an edge, which is where you come in. So you better have brought us some good news. Or start hoping we can eat you, in just one bite! Oh we got news alright boss. News you can use. - Tyra has had babies. - Their's three of them. Yeahh.. Ah, they're really cute. You just want to pinch their little cheeks. More adoptions? No, she said they were her own. And it looks like there's another egg still in her nest. Another egg, huh? If it was taken, she'd come look for it. And then we can take care of her once and for all! My babies' first night of life. I can't wait to teach them everything I know. Ooh, and one day watch them take down their first. Corithisaurus with just their bare claws and fangs. You know, its kind of hard to actually picture them doing that, but maybe... - Okay, into bed with you now. - Nay, nay... Now's our chance to go ex... ...to look for the power key. No way! You are not leaving me all alone, millions of years in the past in the middle of the night. Fine, but we're going in the morning. Before our Dino Mom wakes up. Sue... Sue... will you calm down a little! No! I'm going back to shaking you as soon as I catch my breath. Listen, the time machine has an automatic system that returns in three hours after it left. To minimize time stream disruption... So, the time machine should show up in, five... four, three, two, one! Huh, I guess the clocks are broken. Okay, now we go to plan B. - What's plan B? - Start thinking of plan C. Look at it scientifically. Three pairs of eyes looking for a power key is better than two, right? - Aah, do you see anything? - Nope, nothing back here. Did you hear that? Hear what? That! I bet it's just that weird little dinosaur again? It doesn't sound like that little... It's coming closer, aahh... Okay, maybe you're right... Run... Hey, wait for me! Gotcha!! You can thank me, later. Hey... Uh ooh... Oh, Mom's gonna be so mad. Ernie, what do we do? Grab some rocks! I don't want to lose my brothers and sisters, I just met them, wait for me! What do we do now? Enjoy the ride! Waaa... huuuu... Hahah... Huh? Aaw... Aahhh! Aaahh... Water! Hahahahah... Big, big, water! Max, grab on to Julia. What are you gonna do? I'm inventing a new sport! Ernie! Oh, great! Okay, I'm gonna explain the plan one more time! And I swear, if you don't get it I'll dump you in a tar pit myself. Even if you don't understand, pretend like you do. We sneak up on Tyra's nest, and the first time she walks away, we go there and.. Quick, take the egg. I'm looking forward to the sneaking-up part. I'm a really good sneaker. Ouch, something bit me! What animal would be desperate enough to bite you, stink bag! Help her pull it out! Me? Why do I always have to pull stuff out of his feet? Why not you? Because I'm a smacker, you see? Not a puller. Yeah... I am going to smack him someday. Yeah, he.. he.. he... Tickles... tickles.. Hold still you big footed bean brain! What have you got crushed between your toes. Ah, that's stuff off a lizard. No, watch out, you didn't make it... Man, you're disgusting! Oh boy, that was bad. Will you just pull it out already? We've got work to do. Yeah, but never again. - On a scale? - 350! Buuyaa! Haa! Ah, Ernie? Is he making fun of me? Ernie, Ernie, Ernie... Wow, he can talk! He is just repeating what we say. But, that's incredible! You did great! Helping us dodge around all those rocks. I'm gonna call you... Dodger! Huh... Dodger? Dodger, Dodger, Dodger, Dodger! Haahh... Check it out, Alamosauruses! Those things live like forever. I told Tyra too much red meat is not good when you're pregnant and now look, they're all runts. Lambeosauruses, don't worry they're strictly vegetarian. Durh... what are you now like a workout freak? Haven't you heard of survival? I'm the fittest! Hey, Pterodactyl! Those things are gonna protect us from the Sarcos, we're all dead. We'll be safer at my mother's. Come on. I'm worried... This is really amazing! And you would never have seen this if I hadn't broken mom's rules. Okay, this was worth it, we can go back. - What? To the nest? - No, to... Ahh... Ohh.. - Ha? - What's the matter? I... ahh.. Nothing, I go... Looks like Mom is here after all. Some sitter you turned out to be, Orphan. I thought I could trust you with my babies. They could have gone into the lower valley, and if the Sarcos... Hey, I was keeping an eye on them. At least one of my eyes, maybe other eye, I never know what it's gonna do. But mom, you know kids are gonna test you, that's what they do, except me, I'm a pretty good kid. Well then? If they're gonna start wondering off on their own... it's time to teach them to survive without me there to protect them. Mom, they're a lot tougher than they look, and they call me Dodger, I kinda like it. - Ernie, Ernie, Ernie? - I'm coming Dodger, I'm coming... - But I've got to find that power key. - Humh? Power key... Don't get me wrong. You and Dino Mom are great, and this place is amazing! Amazing, amazing... It's just not home. Home? Home, home, home... Was I gonna let some teeny raptor scare me, back off! Arrrh... Aaahhh... Aarrrhh... Yeah! Yeaarrrhhh... Oops... Awesome! Buuyaa! Thought of anything yet? I'm sort of stuck on Max surrounded by carnivorous dinosaurs, you? Aren't you suppose to be the scientist? Yes, yes I am! And I should be approaching getting our kids back like any other scientific problem. Okay. The time machine moves up the chronal streams toward their starting point. - So for the kids to get back to us. - Wait! Why do they have to come back to us? Is that a trick question? No, I mean we could go to them. We don't have another time machine. But you built one. Yes, but it took four years of trial and error. That's because you never had the PTA Mother of the Year panicking your time. "Mom Rulz." Please, just give me a half an hour to find that power key. I've got to find that power key, and I can't take no for an answer. - Max, where is Ernie? - Ernie? - Ernie? - I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Huh? Ernie, what happened to you? She... grounded me... - Hahah... - Hahah... Ernie, Ernie, Ernie... Ernie, Max, Max again, Dino Mom... me, Dodger. Hey, come here a sec! You guys ever seen tracks like these before? - No. - They're all around the nest. Like something's been checking it out. I can tell where they go. Jules, come here! They're coming from the river, come on let's follow them! Hey Mom, are you gonna let them leave the nest, huh? Well, I wanna see where these tracks lead to. And, it will be good practice for them. Practice, You know, good thinking Mom. That's why you're the Mom. The coast is clear, come on! Ground it! Lets go, lets go! Ooowwhh.. Move it, quiet! Be careful, don't drop it! Try not to... Aargh! I got it, I got it... Watch the egg! You scramble that egg and I'll scramble you! Come on! Carrying it, how hard could it be. What I gotta put up with. You still got them, Julia? Yeah, these marks are little older and I think these one's are three different sets of tracks. Definitely travelling together though! You're really good at is. Almost everything I've learned. I learned from spying on Ernie. - Ernie, what's up? - You've been acting really weird for a while. - Look guys, I actually had... - Hey, look at this! Guys, guys, guys... Guys... The tracks come from down there. A whole other part of the valley? Let's check it out! Well, let's not. What's the big deal? We learned from you, we can handle whatever is down there. I don't think she's gonna let us. Is this how you feel when Mom tells you no, Ernie? She knows this place better than we do, maybe we should listen. Did you hit your head or something? It'd be better than this. Listen, we have to watch the babies closer than ever. - I don't want them near the lower valley. - No! Noo! Not the lower valley, the Sarco brothers are down there. They got teeth, rows of teeth, and claws for ripping and shredding. And then there's the earthquakes, and the boiling hot magma, and the tar pits... I am sure they'll be fine though. Oh, I can't believe that's my car... Yeah, looks good, doesn't it? You know, I never worked this fast, or efficiently in my life. Then again, I never had to rescue my son from the Cretaceous period. It's amazing watching you work. Hey, you know. You're no slouch yourself. I was ready to give up and take a nap before you started screaming thru that bull horn. Uhuh, sorry. I can see where Ernie gets his energy. Yeah. To team work? Oh, I don't like... Oh, why not? Hehuh... Maybe I'll just sneak away and see what's down there. Julia! Max, she's a dinosaur. She can't understand us. You're gonna get us in trouble! Ooh, the power key! I didn't think I'd ever get this back! - Huh? - Aahhh... I mean... Wait, you didn't think you'd get it back? What does that mean? Aahh... I saw it fall off the time machine, and I put it in my pocket. You what? You guys were in such a hurry to get back, and I wasn't ready... I didn't want to go back to Mom and the rules and being grounded. Can you blame me? So instead, you made us stay here? Where we could've been eaten by anything! And then almost got us stranded forever? It's just like Mom said about you, Ernie. You don't care what could happen to other people as long you're having your fun! Okay, look... I've found the power key, so let's just go. Hurmh? Haah? The time machine! Aarrgh... Hey, I didn't take that. Now, we'll never get home. Jules, it'll be okay. Don't! This is all your fault. I miss mom, but you don't. Do you, Ernie? Of course I do. Ooh, poor babies. - What's the big deal? It's just an egg shell. Why hasn't Tyra come yet? - Well.. - I thought she cared about this thing! Hahaha... Could be because we did such a good job. We're such master thieves, she don't even know it's gone. Are we great? She's not coming because what's important to her really, are her babies. They are so cute! And so pink! Let me eat him, please... If they fail their next mission. Bring us one of Tyra's babies, then she'll come. Heheheheheh... Okay, all we need is a plan, right? Like what? Hoping we live for a hundred million years, so we can see mom again? No, but... But... Ernie, you are a genius! What are you talking about? Jules, what does mom tell us to do if we leave the house and she's not there? Huh... leave a note? Right! So, what if we carve a note for Max's Dad... showing him what he has to do to get his time machine to work. To work? Which is... Just splash soda on the controls. Right! And we carve it somewhere we know she'll see it. Some place special like a landmark. Some place we look at every day. Mystery Rock! Bingo! Okay. Are you finished yet? Is it ready? Is it finished? Can we try it? I mean, oooh, maybe I should slow down on these things. Aaghh... Ooops! All that's left to do is to give it a try. - Come on! - I hope this works. Ah, I don't get it. I built it the same way as the other one. But that one didn't work either, remember? Good point. Then the kids did something to it, right? - Huh? - Uuh? Woouuhh... Uh..ooh... Wooh careful, I know we're in a hurry Dr Santiago... but this is a residential neighborhood. You can call me Diego. Careful, Ernie! I hate you, but I don't want you to break your leg. - Jules, this will work, I know it! - Work, work work... - I say you get that one. - Good, you're elected, climb that rock! Well, I meant you should get that one. - Oooh... - Ernie!! - Ahh... - Ernie! Ernie. Whooh... Thanks! Thanks. Thanks! - Aaaah... - Aaaaaaaaaah... Julia! - Here... - Here? Here. Hang on, Julia! I may have lost the key and then the time machine... But I am not losing my sister, too! Errniiee! Run, run... And try not to step on anything... Give me back my baby! Give me back my best friend's sister! Huh? Excuse me! Wooh... No! Follow those thieves! Oh, great! Aah... Excuse us... Have you seen a newborn carnivorous prehistoric reptile with very sharp teeth? Uumh, right over there... Uh..ooh.. Call the animal tutor! Hold on. He went this way, didn't he? My store. My merchandise. We need to trap.. lure it somehow. The drive thru. - Welcome to Dino Burger. - I need 50 burgers to go as fast as you can! We're having a promotion on our Teradactyl taco? You heard me, fifty burgers! And two extra large sodas. Thanks for the ride. Tracks, I can follow these. No! It's a trap! Welcome to our home, Tyra. Care to take a little dip in some hot tar? Hello?... Julia? Julia! Your rein in the upper valley is finished, Tyra. We're taking over now! Huuh... The time machine! Ah, you've got two babies to protect. That'll make it twice as hard to protect yourself. - Sorry, Julia. Pretty lousy rescue... - Where is Ernie? I don't know. Oh man, I've got to do something. Come on, Tyra. Just give up, and we'll make this... easy. Never! Then we'll do it the hard way! Woaaarrrhh... Woaaarrrhh... Come on, let's get out of here. Find out where those roars came from! And try not to get eaten. Oh, that is good advice. Come on! Come and get it, little guy. That's it. Oh, brother, if the PTA saw me now, they'd take back their reward. All these trans... - Come on, come on. - Almost there... Just a few more steps. Gotcha! Tyra's baby! Oh no! Finally, a meal we don't have to share with the Sarco's. I'm gonna enjoy this. Did I say jump on me! Wait! Did I say jump on me! Buuyaa! - Dodger! - Ernie! Awesome roar! Let's go find Dino Mom! At least we landed in something warm and squishy. Oh, terrific! - This is worse than extinction. Umm... Hey, what's extinction? Yeah! Haha... Hey... That was brilliant! That's the kind of plan Max always brags that Ernie makes. He always was smarter than I gave him credit for. All right, come on, let's figure this out. Let's go! We're back where we started. Harumf. Ernie! Hey guys! Guys... guys... She kept you safe. She's been fighting for us. Against those things we saw in the museum, Sarcosuchuses. I saw them. And I liked them a lot better when they were just fossils. No! Ernie! The whole place is coming down. The Time Machine! But, Dino Mom. Ernie, we don't have much time. Let's go home. - Wait, we can't just leave her. - Now, Ernie, we've gotta go! Hurry up, you guys! Ernie, give me the key! Dino Mom. Are we sinking? - We're in a tarpit. - Get us out of here! - Ernie, Ernie, Ernie! - Ernie, what is it? Guys! I know how much getting home means to you... but we can't run away from this. You know me Ernie, I'm always right behind you. Humh, watch this! Hey Dino-Rex, over here! Missed me! Hey! Over here! Earthquake! Woow! You leave my baby brother alone you big bully! Max! Nooo! Dodger! Julia, use the flash! See you in the museum! Oh boy! I'm sorry Sue, this isn't gonna work. Just another Santiago's screw-up. It's so ridiculous how controlling I was. Did you know at dinner time I would sit and actually count how many times they chewed. And if Ernie ever went outside, even if he was just going to the backyard, I always made him... leave a note. Sue? Wait up! Wait a second. Wait up! Let's go. Ernie? Dodger? Ernie! Julia! - Max! - Dad! Mom! - Oh, darling. - I never thought I'd see you again. Look out! Every body get down! You messed with the wrong family. Well, now you're all dead! Let me know if the tar is too hot Sarco. Kids, get behind me! Mom, no! Ernie, just stay back! You're not getting my kids. Mom, it's not what you think. Mom, stop! She found us, she treats us like we were her kids. What? It's true, she even made us wash our faces. Like that. That would be sort of disgusting, if it weren't so amazing. You see it too Mom, wow she's a bigger version of them. - Mom! - Dad! - Max! The time machine worked! Just like you said it would. And that thing that almost ate us, was that a Sarcosuchus? - Yeah. - Woooh, outrageous! She looks so sad. See if this cheers her up. Let's get out of here. Thanks for taking care of us. And for not eating us, of course. Thanks, Mom. You know, I'm gonna miss this place. Smell of the plants, the sounds of the jungle... the dinosaur fights. I'll miss you, too. Come on, Ernie! Thanks again for everything. And watch out for those tar pits! - Good bye! Adios! - We'll miss you. Bye! So, how'd you figure out that you had to spill soda on the controls? I saw the carvings on the rock. Except I never got the chance Mom, I went chasing after Jules... So.. How did it get there? Dodger, Dodger, Dodger. Oh..Oh... Oh..Oh..
