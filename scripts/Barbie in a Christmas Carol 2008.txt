(GIGGLING) Tell me you haven't been in my room this whole time. Well, not forever. Didn't you hear me calling for you? We're late. The Charity Christmas Ball starts in, like, five minutes. All our friends and family are already there. Come on. Small person not next to me. Kelly? Come on. (CHUCKLES) Wow. Looks like someone's got the Christmas spirit. This isn't Christmas. Really? Because the calendar says December 24th, Christmas Eve. And pretty much everyone we know is at the Charity Christmas Ball, where we need to be. I don't want to go to the Ball. I want to do what we do every Christmas Eve. I want to stay home and make cookies and drink cocoa and sing carols and open a special present. That's what we do, and I'm staying here until we do it. Okay. I know you miss what we usually do, but look what we get instead. We'll go to a big party, spend time with our friends and family, and support a really good cause. The Ball will raise money for a hospital. - It's Christmas. - I hate Christmas! I see. Hmm. You know what? I think it's okay if we run a little late. I wanna show you something. That's your snow globe. You said I wasn't allowed to touch it. Well, this is a special occasion. Go on. (CHRISTMAS CAROL PLAYING) There's a story behind this snow globe. There is? A story about the beauty of Christmas, and how one girl discovered it many, many years ago. (SINGING) O Christmas tree O Christmas tree How lovely are thy branches O Christmas tree O Christmas tree How lovely are thy branches You bloom with summer's fairest rose And in the winter's bitter snows O Christmas tree O Christmas tree How lovely are thy Thy Thy Branches (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) BARBIE: Eden Starling was the most famous singing star in Victorian England. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) BARBIE: She was beautiful, talented... (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) (SCREAMS) ... and incredibly full of herself. I hate Christmas! - Hey, that's what I said. - Really? Hmm. Must be a coincidence. Singing those insipid little carols every year. I am a classically trained songstress. I perform opera, Chuzzlewit. (MEOWS) Opera. (MEOWS) Where's my tea and crumpets? There's supposed to be a tray of tea and crumpets right here. And where's Catherine? Catherine! Catherine! (ECHOING) Catherine! (SINGING) Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la la la la la 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa la la la la la la la la Don we now our gay apparel Fa la la la la la la la la Troll the ancient Yuletide carol Fa la la la la la la la la See the blazing Yule before us Fa la la la la la la la la Strike the harp and join the chorus Fa la la la la la la la la Follow me in merry measure Fa la la la la la la la la While I tell of Yuletide treasure Fa la la la la Fa la la la Fa la la la la la la la la - Freddy... - So... - When are you going... - To ask her? Whoa! Ann, Nan, ask who? Come now, Freddy. We all know you want to ask Catherine out on a date. Whoa! (EXCLAIMING) (GASPS) (CHUCKLING) If you want to ask her out, do it now, before we leave for Christmas holidays. Otherwise, out of sight... Poof! Out of mind. You think so? (LAUGHS) I know so. (CLEARS THROAT) All right. I'm really going to do it. (BOTH GIGGLE) I'm really going to do it. I'm going to ask... Catherine! (GASPS) (GROANS) Oh! Hello, Eden. Hello, Chuzzie. EDEN: It's Chuzzlewit. You know he hates Chuzzie. And have you seen these? Oh good, your crumpets. - I told the stagehands to get them for you. - Well, they didn't. I had to ask them. I had to talk to a stagehand. And look, they put on too much butter. It's pooling, pooling, Catherine. That's why it's your job to be there with my crumpets, so they get just enough butter, and... Excuse me? My job is Gad's Hill Theater costume designer, not crumpet butteriser. I do that for you because you're my friend. But still, have a look at them, they're pooling. Eden, I know you feel better when I'm there to watch you perform, but I couldn't tonight. Don't worry. I know you were brilliant as always. I don't need you to tell me I was brilliant, I know I was brilliant. But as a costume designer, I thought you might want to do your job, and see the dress you made onstage. I understand. So, what was so important that you couldn't come upstairs? Look around you, Eden. Look at the tree, it's Christmas Eve. We wanted to celebrate a little before we all go off on holiday. Holiday? Who said anything about a holiday? - Excuse me? - What? - No holiday? - No! No holiday? - But it's... - Christmas! I'm aware it's Christmas, which means there's only two weeks before you will get the privilege of being in Eden Starling's new show. You should be begging to rehearse. No, no, no, no. (SPEAKING FRENCH) This is an outrage! - Eden, we can't work on Christmas. - We have people coming over. - There's a turkey to stuff. - And pies to bake. Oh, we can't be here. Eden, please reconsider, I beg of you. (SMACKING LIPS) You don't want to work on Christmas? You're not dedicated enough to this theatre? Fine, stay home. But if you do, don't bother coming back, ever. (MEOWS) (EXCLAIMS) (SIGHS) (SCOFFS) (ALL CHUCKLING) (SPEAKING FRENCH) What? You need to talk to Eden. - Please, you've known her forever. - She listens to you. Eden doesn't make a move without talking to you. You're the only one who can change her mind without getting us all fired, right? Right. Keep your Christmas plans. Okay, seriously, Eden, you can't... "Eden doesn't make a move without talking to you." Eden... What, they all think I'm wrapped around your little finger? I'm the star. You're asking them to give up Christmas. They have plans. I have plans. Bigger plans than my next show? Yes. I'm leaving town tomorrow and going home. My whole family will be there for Christmas dinner this year. That hasn't happened since we were kids. (SNIFFS) You of all people should know how important that is to me. You know what should be important to you? Me. When I was discovered, I could have had any costume designer in London for my company, but I insisted on you, my oldest friend. I did that. I know you did, and... And you don't care. But I expect that when push comes to shove, I know only one person who's truly there for me, me. It's like Aunt Marie always said, "In a selfish world, the selfish succeed." (SNEEZES) It's not a selfish world. And do you really want to listen to what Aunt Marie said? My Aunt Marie was brilliant. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here right now, and neither would you. But if you can't appreciate that, maybe you shouldn't work here any more. Tell me you're not threatening to fire me. I've seen you backstage sewing things that aren't for the show. I guess working at the top theatre in London isn't enough for you. You had to pick up something on the side. What? No, that's not what you think. Prove it, and show some dedication. Take down the trees, stop the carols, and get ready to work tonight, tomorrow, and all through the week. Anyone complains, anyone goes home, anyone breathes one word about Christmas, they're out, including you. (MEOWING) (SCOFFS) Does everyone understand? (ALL EXCLAIM) (ALL GROAN) - Yes. - We... - Understand. - Oui, oui. What? You have no idea how sad it makes me to see you like this. Merry Christmas, Eden. I said not to mention that word. That is the last time I want to hear it! Christmas? Bah, humbug! - Eden's mean. - Oh, you think so? I guess she can come off as kind of mean, but... - No, she is mean. - Okay, if that's how you see it. - So, that night... - Wait! It's just you usually tell me stories about nice girls, girls who are good to everyone. Well, that's true. Eden's someone who's making a lot of mistakes. But sometimes we can learn from people who make mistakes, don't you think? Like when you left your shoes out in the kitchen and tripped over them, - I learned not to do that. - Exactly. (LAUGHING) And you were carrying spaghetti and it went everywhere! All over the floor and on the walls... Uh-huh. I remember. And in your hair... And, remember, one piece hung right down in your face. And when you breathed in, it almost went up your nose, and... Okay, I remember. Can we get back to the story now? I don't know. Maybe I'm not all done learning yet. Kelly... (GIGGLES) Okay, we can get back to the story. Thank you. So, they rehearsed all that evening. And that night, while Eden was asleep... (CHUZZLEWIT SNORING) Oh! Who's there? (GASPS) (SCREAMS) Eden... Aunt Marie? Yes, my darling. It is I. (LAUGHS) Whoa! (AUNT MARIE GROANS) (MEOWS) Don't just sit there gaping, child. Didn't I raise you with any manners? When your aunt's ghost comes to visit and gets tripped up in her chains, you help her. Of course. I... I must've forgotten. (EXCLAIMS) Much better. Now, child, walk with me. (EXCLAIMS) (GASPS) Mmm. Free up time. Better stay standing. I think you'd have an easier time if you took off some of your jewellery. No, Eden, these chains don't ever come off. They're the chains I formed in life. Chains of selfishness. But you always said selfishness is good. In a selfish world, the selfish succeed. You still say that after all these years? I suppose I should be flattered. (LAUGHING) You really did care for me. Well, of course, Aunt Marie. You raised me. Like a true daughter. And you've become everything I dreamed. Oh, thank you. Which is terrible! So tonight, I want you to change. - You want me to what? - Change, child, change. And not just your nightgown, though with the money you make, you really could do so much better. (SCOFFS) I want you to change your life, Eden. Forget everything I told you. It is not a selfish world. That was my excuse for not having the talent to become a star myself. But when I see what it did to you, when I see how wrong I was... (AUNT MARIE CRYING) You're not my Aunt Marie. You're not even a ghost at all. Not a ghost? I am floating two feet off the ground. How much ghostlier do you want me to be? Stop that. What are you doing? So, what's holding you up, hmm? Wires? (EXCLAIMS) Whatever it is, it's a good trick. (AUNT MARIE GASPS) This is the last time I visit you from beyond, I can promise you that. The real Aunt Marie would never say she was wrong. She raised me perfectly to be a star. I raised you to be a perfectly selfish ninny! But now, I have the chance to make it right. I'm sending you three spirits tonight. Listen to them, Eden. If you're lucky, they'll help you change your life before you end up like me. Now! (YELLING) (EXCLAIMS) (GRUNTS) And you can tell everyone at the Gad's Hill who sent you here that they're all fired. (EXCLAIMS) Chuzzlewit? (PANTING) But what happened to... Strange. (CHIMING) (CHUZZLEWIT SNORING) Chuzzlewit. Chuzzlewit, it's not morning. Oh, stop it, Chuzzlewit, you're going outside. (GROANS) Oh, I had the strangest dream last night. Really? I'd love to hear all about it. (SCREAMS) Who are you? Why, the Spirit of Christmas Past, of course. Didn't your Aunt Marie tell you I was coming? Ha-ha! My Aunt Marie? (GASPS) Oh, you have a kitty. (YELPING) Ooh, you are just the cutest thing. (COOING) Is this another nightmare? (LAUGHS) No, silly. I've come to take you to... (YELPS) (STAMMERING) Where did I put that note? (LAUGHS) No, no. Ah! A-ha! To your girlhood Christmas. (GIGGLING) What fun! My girlhood? Oh, I don't think that's such a good... (GASPS) Toodle-oo and don't be slow. It's off to your Christmas past we go! CHRISTMAS PAST: Off we go then. (EDEN SCREAMS) (MEOWING) (EXCLAIMS) EDEN: Chuzzlewit? Oh! The kitty-witty is afraid we're not gonna take him. Come on, kitty-witty, it's okay. Just hold on. I don't think that's what he is trying to... (BOTH SCREAM) (YELPS) Okay. So, I didn't want to say anything at first, (GIGGLING) But I have to tell you, I'm a huge fan of yours, maybe the hugest. And I just love your voice, especially when you sing Christmas carols. Oh, I was like... I mean... It was like... (STAMMERING) Heavenly chimes, that's what it is. Oh, and it's such an honour to... Oh! I'm sorry. Is it odd for you that I'm such a huge fan? That's not the part that's odd for me. - Hold on. - What? Why? (BOTH SCREAMING) (EDEN GROANS) Oh! I think. Something's not right. We were supposed to get here at Christmas. Oh! I must've miscalibrated. (GRUNTING) No. This is right. CHRISTMAS PAST: It is? But it can't be. There's no tree, no stockings, no presents, no decorations... (GASPS) Oh... You poor thing! (EXCLAIMS) (MEOWS) Oh, poor little kitty-witty boom! Who's the kitty-witty? Did you get a boo-boo? You know, we can't eat or even touch food when we travel to other times, kitty-witty bear. And no one can see us or hear us when we talk, okay? AUNT MARIE: Eden? I'm all done, Aunt Marie. Can I go over to the Beadnell's house? Of course not. After dinner, we rehearse. I know, but I thought we could maybe make an exception today because it's Christmas. They all said they'd really love to see me there. Catherine even said it'd make her Christmas. Make her Christmas? Make her Christmas? What about your Christmas? More importantly, what about your future? You want to be a star, don't you? I do, but... More than anything else in the world? Yes, but... Then, what Catherine and the Beadnells want doesn't matter. What do I always tell you? In a selfish world, the selfish succeed. That's right. And if you want to succeed, you must use every second of your time selfishly. Yes, Aunt Marie. Good choice. I'm proud of you. Now go work your scales until dinner's ready. KELLY: Wait. Aunt Marie's making Eden work on Christmas? Well, every day. But, yes, on Christmas, too. - But that's not fair. - It's not. And there's nothing Eden can do about it? - Mmm. - That's horrible! Wait a minute. I thought you said Eden was mean. I did. I mean, she was, but... Maybe it's just tougher to judge when you know the whole story. Maybe. Tell me what happened next. Okay. So, Eden stayed in her room and practised her scales for an hour. (EDEN VOCALISING) Okay, I know it's devastatingly sad, but this is how you're celebrating Christmas? (GIGGLES EXCITEDLY) But I can't even tell you what a thrill it is to hear Eden Starling, the early years. I mean, am I lucky or what? (LAUGHING) (STOPS PLAYING) Wait, why did you stop? You'll see. (SNORING) Come on. (WHOOPING) (LAUGHING) Oh, this is so much fun. Did you do this all the time? As often as I could. (EXCLAIMING) (GIGGLING) (GASPS) Eden! I'm so glad you made it. I can't believe I'm back here. This was my favourite place in the world. I remember... (EXCLAIMS) (GRUNTING) Oh, did I forget to mention we float through walls? (LAUGHS) Oopsy! (PEOPLE LAUGHING) Ooh! A party! Ooh! Gingerbread. Ah, it's wonderful, isn't it? (MEOWS) (SNIFFS) Oh, look, there you are. You put up my stocking. They always did. We always do. And have you noticed the pile of presents under the tree? (GASPS) I think there's more for you than for me or Nell this year. (LAUGHS) No, it's just for Eden to taste. MRS BEADNELL: Well? - Snickerdoodles. - Your favourite cookie. Which makes you an expert. What do you think? Best I've ever tried. Kiss-up. (BOTH LAUGH) (GROWLING) (BARKING) (SHRIEKS) Chuzzlewit. I thought you said they couldn't see us. People can't. Animals are more sensitive. Paws, there's nothing there. No more barking at shadows or we'll put you outside. (WHIMPERING) (GROWLING) MRS BEADNELL: Paws, no. Here. (GASPS) Catherine! (CHRISTMAS CAROL PLAYING) O Christmas Tree. Because you sing it so beautifully, it made me think of you. Catherine, thank you so much. I love it. But I couldn't bring a gift for you or for your family. Are you kidding? You're here. That's enough. (CHRISTMAS CAROL CONTINUES PLAYING) I really love it. I'm really glad. Come on. (BOTH GIGGLING) (CHUZZLEWIT MEOWS) (SLURPING) (BARKING) Paws! MRS BEADNELL: That's it. Out of the house with you. (YELPS) (GROWLING) (SHOUTING EXCITEDLY) (LAUGHING) Okay, everyone. Gather round! It's time for the show! Ooh, a show! Come on! (ALL CHATTERING) Oh, it's not like it's a real show. It's just a little thing we did every year. Oh, those dresses are stunning. I know. She's been working on them since June. And Eden's been planning the arrangement and choreography just as long. "Just a little thing"? (LAUGHS) Fine, so it was a big thing. But it's still just kids' stuff. CATHERINE: And now, presenting... EDEN: From Eden Starling and Catherine Beadnell, the future toast of London... The greatest Christmas pageant ever! (ALL CLAPPING) (SINGING) Jolly old St Nicholas Lean your ear this way Don't you tell a single soul What I'm going to say Christmas Eve is coming soon Now, you dear old man Whisper what you'll bring to me Tell me if you can EDEN: When the clock is striking 12:00 When I'm fast asleep Down the chimney, broad and black With your pack you'll creep All the stockings you will find Hanging in a row Mine will be the shortest one You'll be sure to know Eden wants a singing book Catherine wants a dress BOTH: Charlie needs a brand new bib Because he makes a mess Now I think I'll leave to you What to give the rest Choose for me, dear Santa Claus What you think is best Jolly old St Nick (ALL CHATTERING) (LAUGHING) And you said you didn't bring gifts for anyone. What do you mean? I didn't. Your talent. Look how happy it made everyone. Oh, I guess it did. I never really thought of it that way. Performing has always been about work and being a star. Except then. (BANGING ON DOOR) I'll get it. Take me home. Now. Why? We're having so much fun. (BANGING ON DOOR CONTINUES) Now! Where is Eden? (GASPS) I didn't realise. I should have left when you told me to. I had no idea. She ruined the whole holiday. Just stood there screaming for what seemed like forever. At me, at Catherine, at the Beadnells... Oh, it was horrible. That was my last Christmas there. Aunt Marie never left me alone for a second after that. I'm so sorry, Eden. (SIGHS) Don't be. Aunt Marie was right. I wasted time on those silly Christmas pageants for the Beadnells. After that, I concentrated on myself. And do you know what happened? I made my Covent Garden debut at 13. Don't you have someplace to go? You're not even real, anyway. I'm sure I'm just dreaming all of this. When I go back to bed, you'll be gone. Spirit? See, it was a dream. (CHIMING) (CHUZZLEWIT SNORING) (CHRISTMAS CAROL PLAYING) Chuzzlewit. Chuzzlewit. Why, hello. (GASPS) (GASPS) Who are you, and what are you doing in my room? Why, I'm celebrating. It's Christmas! (BLOWING) (CHUZZLEWIT SHRIEKS) Was that a little loud? Sorry about that. Now, come on and join the party. Oh, but I'm being terribly rude. (CLEARS THROAT) I am the Spirit of Christmas Present. (WHISTLES) Some travelling music, please. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (GIGGLING) (BOTH EXCLAIMING) How dare you drag me off like that? Don't you have any idea who I am? (CHRISTMAS CAROL PLAYING) Wait, but you said we were going to Christmas present, right? - That's right. - And everyone's here to work. And they're happy. Look at them. See? Working through Christmas isn't such a hardship at all. What is that, Eden? You want us to work for Christmas? Oh, ho! That must have hurt. (ALL LAUGHING) No, it's fine. My kids love that Papa isn't home today. Whoops! (ALL LAUGHING) You're out. You're all out of my theatre. (LAUGHING) That's priceless. EDEN: Priceless? He's throwing tomatoes at me. While juggling. Oh, you could put that in your act. Oh, whose side are you on? These people wouldn't be anywhere without me. They owe me. (SIGHS) At least Freddy's happy. What? Working through Christmas? - Now he can ask... - Catherine out on a date. As long as we clean up before she gets back. I don't think she'd like us throwing tomatoes at her friend. (DOOR OPENING) Hello, everyone. Did you... (GASPS) We're sorry, Catherine. See? Catherine understands gratitude. She won't let you get away with this. What? (EXCLAIMS) Shall we dance? I'd love to. (EXCLAIMING HAPPILY) (CHRISTMAS CAROL PLAYING) That's it. I want to leave. - Oh, what? Right now? - Now! Oh... Oh, all right. (EDEN EXCLAIMS) (MEOWS) (EDEN EXCLAIMS) This isn't my bedroom. I told you to take me home. Oh, I thought you said you just wanted to leave. You have to be more specific. (CHRISTMAS PRESENT LAUGHS) Oh, did I sit in something? (YELPS) Feisty little thing, aren't you? (YELPS) (EXCLAIMS) (BOTH WHINNYING) She's a monster if you ask me. To keep you away from your family after everything we did for her. She's not a monster. She makes me crazy sometimes, but then I remember all the times she made me laugh, and everything we did together. My friend's still in there, Nell. I can get mad at her, but I can't hate her. And look, since I'm not racing home, I don't have to drop off my costumes and run. I can stay and see my other show. Your other show? I knew it! The ingratitude! You are done at the Gad's Hill. Done! - Can you believe that? - Oh, yes, she's very talented. I'm sure she could do a million shows. (LAUGHS) I hope we can still get a seat. (GIGGLES) Oh, would you look at this? (CLICKING TONGUE) I'd never expect a Catherine Beadnell show in a place like this. Would you? (MEOWS) Of course not. Don't you see? She doesn't want me to know about her little sideline, so she made sure they rehearsed here where no one in the universe would come. Oh, you're devious, Catherine Beadnell. Devious. And what new actress is waiting for you in here, Catherine? Hmm? Anastasia Wobbler, Renata Trilby? (DOOR OPENING) - Cassandra... - ALL: Catherine! Catherine! - GIRL: Hello! - Hello, everyone. - Catherine! Merry Christmas, Catherine. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, everybody. Hello, Tammy. Merry Christmas, Catherine. BOY: Would you hug me, Catherine? - I want a hug, too. - All right. Big group hug. (ALL GIGGLING) GIRL: Thank you. Ah, orphans. Oh, you're right. She is devious. So, is everyone ready for your Christmas carol costumes? (ALL GASPING) GIRL 1: Yay! Hurray! GIRL 2: I love mine. Oh, don't worry. I have one for everybody. Catherine, did you get to tell Eden Starling about us? BOY: Yes. TAMMY: Will she come see our show? Will she, Catherine? Will she? I did tell Eden about you. And she wanted me to tell you that she's very sorry she can't come, but she's so proud of all of you. And she personally wishes each of you a Merry Christmas. Hear that? Eden Starling wishes me a Merry Christmas. It must be so amazing to hear her sing every day. - You're so lucky! - I am lucky. - But not because I get to hear Eden sing. - Then why? Because I get to hear you sing. Now, come on, everyone. People will be here soon. Time to put on your costumes and get ready for the show. BOY: Yeah, let's go! (ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) BARBIE: Eden was amazed by the way those children came alive with Catherine. And it wasn't just that she brought them new clothes. In fact, the clothes were the least of it. It was Catherine's attention. The simple fact that she cared. It got to Eden, and she couldn't stop watching. (ALL HUMMING) (SINGING) Joy to the world The Lord has come Let Earth receive her king Let every heart Prepare him room And heaven and nature sing And heaven and nature sing And heaven and heaven and nature sing Thank you. Thank you for this. Oh, it's the least I can do. Have you heard any more about the possible closing? Only rumours. But they don't sound good. We can only wait and hope. Closing? What is she talking about? Oh, the orphanage doesn't have the funds to stay open. Most likely they'll close it before spring. But if the orphanage shuts down, then what will happen to the children? Oh, they'll find their way, I imagine. Street urchins have for centuries. Of course, that's all a batch of humbug to you, right? (SINGING) Joy to the world Wonderful! Wonderful! Spot on! (MEOWS) That was amazing. Thank you. I'm afraid I have to go. ALL: Oh, no, you can't go. But I'll see you all very soon. - No... - Don't go. - Can't you just stay for a little while? - Come on, Catherine. - Please? - You can stay, can't you? I'd love to, but I have to go back to work. TAMMY: No! BOY: No! - Oh, no! - TAMMY: Please don't go. (LAUGHS) That's funny. Almost sounds like you changed your mind about working through Christmas. Oh, not at all. I'm just saying she could take a slightly longer break if she needed to. Slightly. I see. (RINGING) (EXCLAIMS) Would you look at the time? I'm dreadfully late for another appointment. - So just take my sleeve. - Now? Oh, I just thought you'd need your beauty sleep more than you'd need to watch a bunch of singing children. (LAUGHING) What was it your aunt told me she said? In a selfish world, the selfish succeed. (ALL CHATTERING) All right. Let's go. (CHIMING) Shh! Hello, Eden. Hello. You're the third spirit, aren't you? The Spirit of Christmas Future. Are you ready to come with me? Mmm. I don't know. Will I like what I'm going to see? You might not. But sometimes we need to face things that frighten us. It's how we grow. No, I think you should come, too. (SIGHS) - Ready? - Mmm-hmm. - Why are there so many holes? - The future isn't like the past. Every choice you make alters what will happen next. But as of this moment, we'll find your most likely future right here. (EDEN SHIVERS) It's so cold. None of the other ones were cold like this. This future starts with a cold choice. After making everyone at the Gad's Hill work, you found out they came in a few minutes late on Christmas day. So, you fired them all. Of course I did. That's not a cold choice, it's simple consequence. - I warned them that would happen. - Oh, you did, yes. Unfortunately, their replacements didn't quite work out the way you'd hoped... (LAUGHING) Like the hypnotist. And when you hear the word "Brava," you'll cluck like a chicken. See? I just can't be hypnotised. Good luck tonight, though. AUDIENCE: Brava! Brava! Brava! (CLUCKING) (LAUGHING) And the trained dogs. (SINGING) O Christmas tree O Christmas tree How lovely are... (EXCLAIMS) (DOGS YELPING) (LAUGHING) Enough! Even if all that happened, so what? I have a public, and they'd stand by me through anything. Good. If that's true, you have nothing to worry about from the future. Oh, where's this? (RAT SQUEAKING) (GASPS) Get him, Chuzzlewit. Get him. (CHUZZLEWIT MEOWS) (GLASS SHATTERING) (GROANS) That's not... Is that me? Go, Chuzzlewit! Go! Oh, Chuzzlewit, I'm sorry. That would have been your Christmas dinner. (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) What is this? A joke? This can't be my future. (SHIVERS) Too cold. Ooh! Catherine Beadnell. "Catherine Beadnell presents a new fashion line for spring. "Come to her studio in Grindstone Square "to see work from the premiere designer in all of Europe." (SIGHS) Catherine. Well, I haven't seen her in... Ages. What? You haven't seen her and she's a success? Go! She can help you. Catherine would never let you live like this. Grindstone Square... Mmm. But she wouldn't be there today, it's Christmas. Still, what are the chances of this flyer sticking to my window? It's almost like some kind of sign. It is a sign! You sent her the flyer, didn't you? Mmm. Do it! Go to the studio and see her. Come on, Chuzzlewit. (MEOWS) Let's go visit an old friend. Yes! That's why you brought me here, isn't it? Oh! This is where everything turns around. - I want to follow her. - Are you sure? Yeah, of course I'm sure. Let's not waste a second. Very well, then. Holiday? Who said anything about a holiday? - But... But it's Christmas. - I'm aware it's Christmas. Which means there's only two weeks before we show the new line of the most popular label in London. You should want to work every day. - But if you're not dedicated enough... - Oh, I am. I promise. - I'm sorry I complained, Miss Beadnell. - Good. I don't understand. She doesn't sound like Catherine at all. She sounds like... - Eden! - Catherine. Looking good, Chuzzie. (MEOWS) I can't believe I found you here at work on Christmas. I thought you'd be home with your family or... Or celebrating somewhere. I don't really celebrate Christmas any more. I was a little soured on the holiday when... When was I soured on it again? Oh! Yes! When you fired me because I came in late on Christmas day. Uh-oh. Oh, right... Um... No, it's okay. You actually did me a favour. You proved I'd been wrong and you were right. No. No, don't say it, Catherine. Don't say it. It is a selfish world. And in a selfish world, the selfish succeed. I see. I'm not 100 percent sure that's really true, actually. Oh, I am. I tried to be selfless. I looked out for you. I looked out for everyone at the Gad's Hill. I even tried to help out one of the poorest orphanages in London. - Know what happened? - I fired you. Which meant I had to scramble for work. I found something, but it took me out of town for months. Know what I found when I got back? No. I found nothing. That orphanage I was helping? It closed down while I was away. I'd had no idea. There was one little girl I was ready to take in myself. Tammy! Tammy! But she was gone. They all were. Scattered out in the world to try and fend for themselves. You can imagine. No. Not the children. Oh, Catherine. My point is, I learned my lesson. Caring hurt. So I stopped. Now I just concentrate on myself, and look! I'm a star. Just like you used to be. Catherine, listen. Don't make the same mistakes I made. You're better than that. Don't be like me. Do you hear me, Catherine? Catherine! So, you can't help me? I'm done helping people, Eden. It never works. Oh, I see. I'm... I'm sorry I bothered you. Merry Christmas, Catherine. CATHERINE: Eden. Here, it's cold out there. Oh, I've got it. I've got it. (EXCLAIMS) I've got it. And it's completely useless. I guess that's the way with us, Chuzzlewit, isn't it? Chuzzlewit? (PURRING) Chuzzlewit. (SCREAMS) (DOOR CLOSES) (MEOWING) (PURRS) That's it? That's all you have to say? How did we come to this, Chuzzlewit? I wish... Oh, it doesn't matter what I wish. Come on, Chuzzlewit. No! That can't be it! This can't be your life. This can't be my life! There has to be some mistake, there has to be a way to change things. That chance passed long ago. As of now, this is the road of your future. But it can't be! It's too horrible. I don't want to live this life. I want to change. Oh, please. Please just give me the chance. I want to change. I don't want this. Please, please. Just give me another chance. (GASPS) Please! (GASPS) (MEOWS) - It's morning! - MAN: Good day, sir. Merry Christmas. (GASPS) It's Christmas morning. It's Christmas morning! Oh! Oh! It hasn't happened yet! Oh! Oh, quick! The portals! Chuzzlewit! Oh! All those portals of the future, we can choose a new one. A new portal, yes. We don't have to make the same mistakes! We can change everything! Oh, yes! Chuzzlewit, we can... (STAMMERING) Help people. Help people, yes. (CHUCKLING) We can make this the best Christmas ever! Wonderful, Chuzzlewit. (EXCLAIMS) We have to go shopping! Can't do shopping, I'm not dressed. Oh, it's Christmas. The stores are all closed. Chuzzlewit, what do we do? (MOANS) Yes. We'll go shopping right here. Come on, Chuzzlewit, let's do it. Let's go Christmas shopping. (EXCLAIMS) (CHRISTMAS CAROL PLAYING) (DOOR CLOSING) Stop! Stop the rehearsal, stop everything. (GROANS) Whoa! Please, don't fire us. We're all here. Okay, yes, maybe we're a couple of minutes late, but... - Please, let us... - Keep our jobs. No, it's okay. It's okay. I'm not here to fire anyone. It's Christmas. I'm here to send you home to your families! But you said... Well, forget what I said. I was crazy, I was wrong! Go! Go! I mean, wait. Stop! Come back. I have presents. And look, a little elf, elf, elf to help me deliver them. I of course saved my shopping for the last minute. And, of course, everything was closed today. So I had to just grab what I had, but... Merry Christmas, Maurice. Ann! Nan. Careful! Heavier than it looks. Freddy. What time is it? Cuckoo! (LAUGHS) ALL: Thank you, Eden. MAURICE: Merci. Catherine, I'm saving yours for later. Oh, wait. No, there's more, there's more. I forgot. I found something else in my house that I really wanted to give you. Christmas bonuses! Yes. Because you're all so talented, and it is truly an honour and a pleasure to work with you. Now, go have a holiday. I'll see you in two weeks when we open. Merry Christmas! Thank you. It was supposed to be flowers. (CHUCKLES) I love them. But I have one more thing for you, a favour to ask. - Merry... - Christmas! EDEN: That was beautiful. Thank you. I was wrong about you, Eden. You're one of the good ones. Merci. Merry Christmas. Yes. Yes! - What was that all about? - I guess he liked his Christmas present. Eden, I... Catherine, I know for a fact you've been working on another show behind my back. Please, let me explain. And I think it's wonderful. I want to go with you to see the kids perform. I understand I might have a couple of fans at the orphanage. You do, but how do you know about the orphanage? Maybe it came to me in a dream. Come on. Let's hurry. Wait. Let's make our special guest a surprise. (GASPS) Yes! (GIGGLING) ALL: (SINGING) And wonders of his love Joy to the world (ALL CHEERING) That was amazing, everyone. Thank you so much. But we're not done quite yet. I've brought you a special Christmas present. A special guest I thought you might want to meet. Special guest! Merry Christmas, everybody. (ALL GASP) - Eden Starling! - ALL: Eden! - BOY: There you are! - Tammy. (GASPS) You know my name. - BOY: I want a hug, too. - Of course, of course. Catherine's told me so much about you. I feel like I know you all. Oh, Elizabeth, Jacob, Edmund. You were all incredible! I'm so happy to be a part of your Christmas. Oh, and I have a special present for you all. I am going to personally adopt this place. Anything you need, new furniture, toys, books... Anything and everything. I just want you to come directly to me, and I will make sure you have it. I want these children to have the best. ALL: Hurray! I'm stunned. There are no words. This is the best Christmas ever! God bless us, everyone! CHILDREN: Yay! You're incredible. Where did all this come from? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Just trust that it had a lot to do with you. Thank you. Thank you for giving me back my friend. CHILDREN: Hurray! Oh, your Christmas present. Part one. (GIGGLING) (SNIFFS) (LAUGHING) (WHISTLING) Eden! They're the fastest horses money can buy. If we leave now, I think we can make it to your parent's house in time for dinner. That is, if it's okay for me to tag along? Okay? I'd love it if you came home with me for Christmas. FREDDY: Ladies. Freddy! You're driving us? It would be my greatest honour. But first, sometime when it's not Christmas and we're not going off to visit your family, I was wondering if I might... If I could have the pleasure of... That is... If I could have... The honour of... Freddy, are you asking me on a date? Yes. I'd love it. Thank you. Yes! Thank you so much, Eden. Wait, there's more. Although, this is really more my Christmas present. I can't believe you still have it. I do. And from now on, I'm keeping it on my nightstand, so I'll remember to hold this feeling of Christmas in my heart every day of the year. And one day, I'll pass it down to my children and grandchildren and my great grandchildren, so they'll remember, too. Thank you. That's a perfect Christmas present. Oh! Chuzzlewit. Chuzzlewit? Chuzzlewit? (SIGHS) (BURPS) (MEOWING) Oh, Chuzzie. (BURPS) This snow. The carriage can't make it through this weather. Oh, no. (SINGING) We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year Glad tidings we bring To you and your kin Do you see that? I thought maybe it was one of your magic tricks. No, I've never seen anything like that in my life. I have. (SINGING) We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas FREDDY: It's amazing. What? But how? (SINGING) We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year Glad tidings we bring To you and your kin We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year Goodbye. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. - Goodbye. - See you soon. Goodbye! Merry Christmas! We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year And did they get to the Beadnell's house in time for dinner? They did. And every year after that, they spent Christmas the same way. They helped others in the morning, then spent the evening together with their families and friends. - Barbie? - Yes, Kelly. That snow globe that Catherine gave Eden, the one that Eden said she'd pass down to her children, is that the same snow globe? Are we related to Eden? Did this story really happen? Maybe. But I do know one thing for sure, this is yours now. Really? For keeps? (LAUGHING) For keeps, so it can remind you to keep the beauty of Christmas in your heart every day of the year. Just like Eden. Thanks, Barbie. - Merry Christmas. - (CHUCKLING) Merry Christmas, Kelly. (DOOR OPENING) Okay, so I'm at this crazy, amazing charity Christmas Ball, I'm looking everywhere for my girls, and you're still here? Hey, Nikki. Sorry. We're just running a little late. But I think we're ready now. - Are we? - Yeah, we are. Wait till you see the Ball, it's so cool. Everyone's dancing and having so much fun, and they're getting tons of donations for the hospital. (CHRISTMAS CAROL PLAYING) KELLY: You think maybe I could give something? I have some allowance saved up. BARBIE: I think that would be amazing, Kelly. (CHRISTMAS CAROLS PLAYING)
