The elimination of that choice... ... Is an insult to fans George Lucas. With all due respect to Mr. Lucas... ... Is not only his dream, his fantasy. Joe Leydon Film critic Variety It is a universe in which we all live now. It's an interesting question: Does the public right to material their own culture? I would say yes. - I think once released... - God! Think about it. You're throwing material. Is it yours or of others? - I think it's shared. - Yes I want to make the analogy the shirt that belongs to you... ... And Star Wars is that shirt for George Lucas. He owns that shirt. And you can do whatever he wants with it. - Now, what happens... - But it is despicable. You have to respect some the fans. Are the same people who bought an empty cardboard box... ... Kenner in 1977. It is irresponsible because you say: "I created this bloody empire... ... In you all, of those who got millions of dollars. " And they pay you with, "I do not care." At one level, this puts a burden excess of any artist. Who can stand the fact that suddenly... Everyone feels... owning your art? Thanks to Lucas, the VHS is still alive.

RESPONSE PUBLIC RELATIONS Lucasfilm This comes from the department Public Relations for Lucasfilm. "We expect to launch these films 'Original' in a bonus disc. " "Original" appeared in quotes by the way... Like they really... were not the originals. It's something we invented. The negatives of the films were permanently altered... For the creation... Special Editions of... Impressions... and existing early versions deteriorated. "As the films do not represent George's artistic vision. " We said they did not even exist. Not even possible. Why go back on the argument artistic vision? "We want you to know we have no intention... ... Now or in the future, to restore earlier versions. " In essence, says that the original negative no longer exists... ... Because of its restoration. But how could it be? Because there must be transformed the films on digital... And then... must have worked in their new special effects... ... With the digital version. And then this new digital version be transformed back to tape. So now the film there in the new version. But you still have the original tape with which it started working. No, really, physically cut a negative. A file... It doubles the negative, then changes are made after that. So I find it hard to believe... They have really destroyed... the negative of the film. And if they did, it's atrocious. "Never again you will see the original." That says Lucasfilm but probably not true. In the mid-eighties, There was a filmmaker... ... It was on a crusade against Ted Turner... I wanted color... movies black and white. The same filmmaker argued that black and white films... Were the epitome... of our cultural heritage... ... And that not due modify. That was filmmaker George Lucas.

This would be a great loss for our society. Do not allow our cultural history is rewritten. George Lucas 1988 congressional testimony Never heard . Then I say, "What rot." He says: "There can be colored old movies... ... But I'm going to completely change my film and it will ". - It's obscene. - Okay, because I wanted... You lideraste campaign against the color of the films. You know why they should not be changed. HUNTERS OF THE LOST ARK Is different. These are my movies. One could argue... ... that if you entered National Register... Episode IV: A NEW HOPE FILM - 1977 ... belongs to the whole world. belongs to all Americans... ... because it is so important, culturally, to the United States. So when you say, indiscriminately: "We will change it and improve it... ... And evolve with the times "... Sculpt... it's like Bill Clinton on Mount Rushmore. Has a responsibility with the history of cinema. You know... Can you get Congress to send: "You must deliver that Smithsonian museum now "? Maybe not, but would be great to happen. The Library of Congress rejected all our requests for interviews. Like the Film Archive and Television at UCLA... ... And the Association of Archivists Moving Image. Mr. Lucas, please throw them.

For example, all versions of The Clone Wars . I'll buy it, sell the rest of the Internet... Cherish... and damn the three discs I want. All right. Steven Spielberg launched an edition of E. T. It is a double album. changed some things digitally. Then there's the original version E.T . E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial ORIGINAL FILM I think Blade Runner there in five different versions. Brazil there in three different versions. Terry Gilliam accepted these various versions. When Criterion released the box including all versions... ... even he hated and which had nothing to do. THE ONLY BRAZIL NO CUT BY TERRY GILLIAM What better way for Lucas... Demonstrate their confidence... in the changes you made? Putting both on the same disk... ...

George never made another film after that... But transformed... a producer and entrepreneur. In a way, is the worst thing that happened to George Lucas. Could have made a happy career doing dramas... Some documentaries... and cutting edge material. But became in a large corporate entity. He was someone who struggled against the institutions... ... and turned it the overnight. I.L.M. INDUSTRIAL LIGHT & MILLION It is arguable that the success of the series destroy George Lucas as a filmmaker. GEORGE LUCAS THE CREATOR Deprived us of those movies... ...

With George Cukor, who does not like the word "filmmaker". Compared with toymaker. I like to see me as a toy manufacturer who films. Products are crazy. Even Spaceballs ... - ... make fun of them when... - Yes! - ... Mel Brooks says... - "Spaceballs the lunchbox. - Spaceballs toilet paper. " - Yes Use briefs War of galaxies , for the love of God. IAN PARKER Venom Sgt Alias We are like Oliver saying "Please sir, can I get more?" And instead of saying no George Lucas says: "Yes! I have a lot more oats." I can not imagine landfills, with the passing of this generation... ... the legacy we leave will be a lot of plastic. And I'm partly responsible. Admittedly that is global capitalism... ... and global consumerism. George Lucas did not invent that. was found embedded in a strange relationship about it... ... And as a result, all we are from the same way. I buy almost everything you say " The Star Wars." It is a contract. Well? It's like... If you throw something quality buy it. assume that quality is if " The Star Wars." But that does not happen. Every time you throw things.

I took my husband, my son... Consumed every dollar... and I had and I could never save. All toys that are behind me here... ... I have made the heart ache Over the past 30 years. I think I'll throw a box of products and sell expensive. I will not tell people separately that cost less. It would be fun. I bought it on VHS. NATHAN BEAUDRY Alias?ChefElf I bought the whole box three or four times. This is the last box, and I bought it like an idiot. This because it brings things Star Wars and Jedi... ... and the next because it is mastered... ... thus is improved. I went to buy because it was widescreen. again because was a special assembly. Do not know why I bought that, but... It's like giving us an orgasm. We had an orgasm, and now says: "Come on, no more." We say: "Enough. Let me sleep." That that, "I being exploited"... NAR WILLIAMS TV Presenter, Producer Please. Let's be serious. Someone provides a product, you choose to buy it. If you want to see, or if you have it... ... has nothing to do with who did it. They did it because they thought I could have a market. In this case, they are right. If the fans want to buy everything what set George... ... as if compelled... ... is like a drug. You can say someone became addicted. Finally, it is you that is injected. There are many people like this... ... And perhaps always be addicts to Wars . I, personally, since I left... Takashi Okazaki Afro Samurai creator Now only buy... R2-D2 products. We would love to live in a world that do not buy anything... ... but let's face it, not... ... and finally, We love what we buy. If you add that to the resentment... growing followers... against George Lucas... ... you'll notice a tortuous relationship with the objects sold. By God! Think it's easy to abandon this. Now that I talk about this, I feel I was in therapy. Hello, my name is Chris. The fans kept him alive... ... With toys, the stories and speculation... Whether there would... more adventures of this series and how they would be. Caravan of Courage is , but that does not count. Want more, and when there is nothing... ... You take care of creating something yourself. From 1983 to present to The Phantom Menace ... Lynn Cherny Creative There was nothing... but fanworks. Followers kept alive the saga... COREY VIDAL YouTube Partner Dilated with the universe... and video games. People wanted more. He called A New Hope, Episode IV ... So... lay a trap. EPISODE THREE Revenge of the GEEKS Today is my first day as a writer of the new series Star Wars . New pencil box. I'm ready. I just need an idea. I've been waiting did the episodes I, II and III... ... since I was 14 years when he left the last. DRAF 13 JANUARY 1995 When they announced that finally would come... ... my first thought is this would be the best... EPISODE ONE "EL COMINEZO" ... It would launch. All want to see this movie. This will be a giant time that will define a generation. - All fans... - "What will?" Created his film...... - ... Created it in his head. - Yes Then I thought: "By God, we all hate." It may not hate because it has... much involved emotionally in the first. I remember the day they announced the name... ... And The Phantom Menace came out and they all said: - "What does that mean?" - "What the hell does that mean?" As of Friday, thousands of theaters around the country... Siskel and Ebert Launched a new advances...... ... What might be described... As the premiere... most anticipated of the decade. Five words: Wars . - The Wars. - The Wars. - The Wars. - The Wars. Wars. - Fans lined up... - Just to see the progress. Publication The Hollywood Reporter said that the Mann's Chinese Theater... Competition... went up to 1,100%... surprise... when presented a preview of the film. No, I will go after the advance. I do not know. Did you pay to enter just to see the progress... - ... And then you left? - Yes Because they are two and a half minutes great. It was amazing. There was never anything like it. By God! I began to mourn as not doing in years. I had a heart attack. I think God should be ashamed as a creator to watch this movie... And realize... that did not create something that good. This is something I will remember and tell my children. It's camera - I know, I look crazy. It was like a Beatles concert. DENNIS Przywara Director of Starwoids It was like, "Obi-Wan Kenobi is Anakin Skywalker with "... ... And you thought the world was going to end. "God, if the world ends, I hope to live May 19 to see this... ... Because I can not believe this happen. " There never was anything so promoted as Episode l ... - No. - ... In the history of... - Even Jesus had less promotion. - ... Movies. FAMILY The last episode of Wars ... Opens tonight... throughout the country. LOS ANGELES - CHICAGO - NEW YORK CRAZY FOR THE PHANTOM MENACE is expected that 2.2 million people from New York to Los Angeles... ... miss work to be among the first fans... I'll get TICKETS IS MY DESTINY ... of the new The Star Wars . THANKS GEORGE We are here front of Mann's Chinese Theater... ... And people are cheering. I come from Australia ... LINCOLN Gasking TRAVELED FROM AUSTRALIA Thousand hours ago... and I do tail. I come from London. - We're from Switzerland. - We come from Poland. It is a historical event for this generation. What will you do if the movie is bad? Maybe look again. I do not think it is bad. There is no way it is bad. Do not say that. There is no way it is bad. - Could be. - No. - Could... - How is it possible? When the first images, I'll be ecstatic. People scream. 53:00 MINUTES FOR "THE MENACE" Missing 53 minutes and counting The Phantom Menace . Let's see Wars ! THE STAR WARS EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE I was there, like everyone else, in May 1999, in line... ... lightsaber in hand, late night. I saw that movie ILM in San Francisco. saw in Madison, Wisconsin... ... in a movie theater called the Orpheum immense. It had 1,700 seats and crowded. Everyone was there. There was much expectation. People were jumping the seats... Happy... they were crazy. Then the lights went out, and they all shouted. During the progress, people booed. Lucasfilm logo appeared, and all cheer again. They make your hair stand on end when you see... "Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away... " When you see him on screen. THE STAR WARS Opening appears, and people are crazy... That's incredible. Who thought this day would come? And it was one of the greatest moments... Life... a spectator. Then begins the film. I knew that. The language of the opening sequence was wrong. Not appreciated as correct. But I said, "Okay. I'll keep looking." It started as a glow in the heart... Down... and then... ... Down here. I remember thinking: "By God, Is it really...? Is that bad? " I was very disappointed. I said "What? Is it bad?" I began to get discouraged... But... continued: "It Wars . Will improve. The Jedi is not great, does not matter. It will be good. " Was used to seeing people who saw the original... Screaming... excited, clapping, laughing. This was indeed a silent projection. Perhaps it was something different. You may not notice it. Perhaps we should see her again. It was the first time in my life... A movie... really disappointed me... I was sad... and... ... To the point of having to lie about what was to maintain the honor. I remember interviewing in local news... ... Where they said: "Yes, but tomorrow we go again." There was still hope. People are not convinced... ... Until I saw her... ... Because everyone saw it twice. We all saw it again. I waited four days in the rain... ... peeing in my hands and drinking it to buy tickets... ... to see The Phantom Menace third time Yes They are like the victims who return the scene... Andrew Weekes Filmmaker To assume it... somehow. I went one and again. But not having fun... ... But rather to convince that amused me. Saw The Phantom Menace at the movies 13 times. RIDDLE SONGE Orbital Comics, London (UK) In part, I did it because they can not see a Star Wars for 17 years. In part it was to accept what it was. The second time I saw... I realized... that I was enjoying it more. What a disappointment! # All began in line to see Episode I # # My girlfriend had picked the hair # # But it turned out that the film not what I expected # Tell me what you want. Wars did not care people who both wanted. Is this the best you can do? Eighteen years old. We can not separate how to see things now... How we saw them... then... ... And how we see them on the basis of how we saw then. When he left The Phantom Menace , I noticed a change in the followers... ... That went from fans George Lucas... ... To take it so personally... They thought... George Lucas wrote... - ... The film to annoy them. - Yes Who likes the prequels? Shut up! You are wrong. We all knew Emperor Palpatine would. We all knew Anakin Skywalker would be Darth Vader. OWEN ZIEGLER YouTube Partner Training But I never expected it to be so. In my world Wars ... ... Do not exist the numbers I, II and III. George Lucas spoke to make prequel... ... But they were always scripts... Before he died... in a car accident in 1989. Just after making Last Crusade . Brandon, wanting something very badly does not make it true. People made see as the worst movie ever. I do not care. Yet I saw 13 or 14 times. TO THE CAMERA SHY French fan There was a place of gratitude the new trilogy, it was fun. is a group of people who say: "To us yes we liked the new movie. " "We want to be like. Really." I think that is licensed to do what you want... JONATHAN HOFFMAN Disappointed fan But disappointed... a generation of fans. So I see it as one of them. followers know exactly what they want. want more of the latter who read and they loved it. That fans want. If you liked what you did... Like... want another, please. I do not think responsibility... TONY MILLIONAIRE Maakies cartoonist ... To the public at all. I think you should do what you want. You do things you like. For me, if a cartoon does not make me laugh... ... or if I do not like, do not print. But I will not take anyone's advice. His responsibility to the fans is to take your money. I have very bad news for us, the fans. We are old and paunchy. Not be like Star Wars summer of 1977. But I tried to tell me: "Let me remember... ... It's a big dumb movie about wizards of space. That is what is supposed to be. So while you have magicians space, I will be happy. " But it turned more difficult than I thought... Jar Jar... because. He is the key to all this... ... If perfected. Because it's funny any character... ... From the previous films. Your Honor, I created my own lawyer... Thanks to the magic... of digitization. Look how well it integrates in this court. Amazing. I call McPoopoo Puddles. It was a beautiful balloon Globe Wars ... ... And we all love the balloons... ... And then brings Jar Jar Binks... ... Which is a large needle and burst that bubble. GEORGE R. BINKS WHALING What kind of name is that space for a lover? You're a damn fool. You are an evil bastard. WESLEY WILLIS Artist and musician You say many idiocies. You can say goodbye to me. Jar Jar Binks # # Jar Jar Binks # # Jar Jar Binks # # Jar Jar Binks # # Discrrame. # You're a fool fool # - Not like you. - No matter, no one wants. You're an idiot evil # # # You are a poor moron # What do you feel, Jar Jar? Jar Jar Binks # # You want to fight now? Jar Jar Binks # # In A New Hope , is a very natural flow... Of humor... all the characters, more or less. And here are all a bunch of fools. And the person it is supposed to be funny... Is the least funny... ever. NOT Gungans is a cartoon character invading this world... I... took me seriously until that moment. I was disappointed when he started talking. I thought it was that kind of movie. We had brought a level and then said: "Will a mood vulgar child... And some strange animals... farts will be thrown in our face... ... And say, 'yoosa Pee'... And you will laugh... because you like Beavis and Butt-Head ". Jar Jar Binks is what someone no sense of humor... ... considered funny. Talks and walks strange. It has speech problems. It's funny, right? Some said it was a racist stereotype... A comedy... of the thirties... out... where Stepin Fetchit Mantan Moreland or... ... Saying, "Feet, run!" It was hip-hop version of C-3PO. The difficulty is if Jar Jar Binks is racist... Humor... because it looks black face... ... But no one saw this kind of humor... If 12 years... and see prequel saga... Racist character... whose racism is so encoded in the story... Racist... still? Jar Jar worst of it exists. MATT COHEN Writer / broadcaster podcasts We can not help it. If you're a fan... ... In your heart you know that Jar Jar not only in the movies... ... But is an integral part. Jar Jar Binks is fundamental part of the whole saga. Meesa proposes... ... That the Senate give immediately emergency powers... ... The Supreme Chancellor. He is the deciding vote to give many powers to the Emperor. FRANKIE FRAIN Creator George Lucas by LOTR You know Luke says, "Drop dead." But thanks, George, for out of the second film... JoBlo [Alias?BERGE Garabedian] JoBlo.com ... Or at least only include five minutes. We appreciate it. Sometimes listening. But that takes Episode II where Jar Jar first appears... Anakin meets... and all... ... and approaches, looks at the camera and seems to smile... ... As saying: "I'm still here, folks. I know you hate me, but I will go. " What are they trying to do? You really try to get angry? I like his arrogance that makes continue with the character... THE STAR WARS EXCLUSIVE FOR SUBSCRIBERS ... And it will Episode II and Episode III ... And will not give... the desire of followers. I think he thinks that is true to its principles. I had 3PO cry out against Jar Jar... ... and took notes tone down at first. Then I saw coming from George notes: "No, 3PO should be tougher with Jar Jar. KEVIN RUBIO Writer Clone Wars You should treat it like the fans. " As a fan of burlesque and mixture of genres... I like to watch... seriously of the Force... Comedy... and a Gungan trying eating fruit in the same shot. This combination seems to me successful... ... Because one does not negate the other. Jar-Jar Binks is proof to me... Lucas... that still has things that show... Still want to risk...... CROS RENAN Film scholar and writer ... And not see it as a exaggerated character. Is an experiment it connotes a persistent desire... Giving a show... to the public. The problem with Jar Jar Binks not the character. It is with you, the fans, they have forgotten what it was to be children. - Kids like Jar Jar! - Why? What about the Ewoks? They were rubbish. Not complain of them. Yeah, but Jar Jar Binks makes that the Ewoks look like Shaft. - Kids like Jar Jar. - Prequel... Yes I had to dress like that monster and go to the birthday. I think people your age hates Jar Jar... NOAH BEN DEPSKY New generation ... Because it's a new character. It is one of the new characters. RICH ROY Older generation - How about Jar Jar? - Jar Jar, yes. BROOKLYN, NEW YORK I think it's funny. I also like the name. SOFIA MEDAROVA New generation Your parent agrees with you? Do you what you are? I do not like as much as you. SIMON YOUNG Previous generation Have tastes sweetest child, right? Have a more mellow life. WILL ANDREWS Comedian Perhaps Jar Jar is a genius. Who knows? You were not there at first. You do not know what is good and important it was. That's all for you... Toys... this ad exaggerated. People like you make me sick. What is it? My friend who has a child of 7 years loves Star Wars . But for him, everything is Wars . Episodes I-VI, The Clone Wars and video games. What Luke did well for us... Seems to continue to do well... for children today. What you love about the movies? Me? I like that. Movies are not competing, right? It is condescending way... Because it makes these movies... for children. - What has been said many times. - Yes George said: "These films are for kids. I make them for children. " And when we loved the trilogy original, we were kids. Does George or old age is upon us? Should we, as adults, understand what it does as a filmmaker... ... Or should have made films for people who matured... ... And enjoyed the first? I think that that is made for children... ... And that's why I did not understand, is nonsense. Yes, it is difficult to know if you really believe that... Or taken by surprise... and had to give a reason. If the child did, what they care about the Trade Federation... Fees and charges... and sessions of the Senate and...? I tried to explain to my 5 year old on the trade embargo. - Is distracting. - Yes... It was thus One word sums all that is wrong... Insulted... and how all fans, "midi-chlorians." Midi-chlorians. - Talk about it. - Midi-chlorians. - I also like. - Midi-chlorians. And the Force? They are microscopic bacteria... In your blood... which are called midi-chlorians. If you do not take this seriously, I go. When Obi-Wan Kenobi introduces the concept of the Force... JOHN C. WRIGH Science fiction author Describes it as... an energy field that binds the galaxy. The public knows that talk a psychic field. A FIELD OF ENERGY THAT GIVES POWER Talk about something spiritual . It's a lovely idea, a lovely notion. Then reduced to a biological factor. Take Force... ... that is supposed to be linked to your sense of spirituality... ... and your moral code... ... and transforms in a mess inherited from your parents. What a nonsense! It is like painting the face of God. PETER HANSON Director of Tales from the Crypt You have midi-chlorians , not you. Panel Worldcon 2009 Montreal, Quebec You will never be a Jedi no matter how hard you try. Thank you. Everyone who grew up with the series original had that moment... ... to sit in the room without admitting... ... and trying to lift something with the power of your mind. It's accessible then. DAVID BRIN Author of The Postman Mutants was not something... ... Superheroes, demigods. It was something tangible. How to say: "Look how much religion you have. See how much spirit and faith you have. " - But the idea of?the Force... - It's ruined. NAR WILLIAMS - TV Presenter BOO FRIEDMANN - Screenwriter - No, it - Ruined? - Yes What essentially teaches the Force? Live without fear, without anger. Do good for yourself and others. Be opened. My blood tests says I can not do that. That is nonsense. It's like the Scientologists and their tetanes. Enough. No Scientologists goals. You can not worry what others think. For example, Wars is my story, as my house is my home. And if I want to paint my house green... Even if everyone thinks... should be red. I'm going to paint Jar Jar. I think Wars original, or at least... ... A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are great... And have made... in collaboration with other people. When George decided to face the prequels and do it in a vacuum... I do not think... that's the best way to work for an artist. It's over a certain level of criticism. He spent the idea of?a true collaboration. This is about a channeling internal stories... ... Who have been on your mind for a long time. I wanted to control my work... ... And that people do not change. It's fun because I do not answer to anyone. Nobody tells me what to do. I earned it. If you have a film empire to help you make movies... What's the point... if you do not feed back? I think he took something wonderful and maintain control over that... Capitalized... while with him, I think it destroyed. Yes, it's like an overprotective parent. And if so, ruined his son. And that bothers because he had a bright son. It's a great day for you. Wait while I prepare. - What will prepare? - Your new study, silly. - For you to continue writing the series. - How? Write Episode III , George. But this time, will do well. You'll do as I see it. At the time, it hurt a lot... The studies... to ride again THX-1138 and American Graffiti. He swore to himself this will never happen again... ... Because from now on... Would have total control... about their jobs. In 1999, fans began to reassemble his movies... With the tools... Luke offered. This is perhaps one of the best. Episode is called I.II . Is a cover of about 70 minutes. And it's a much better movie. But I love this legend: "Look how they should be." And then a graph of BAND-AID. It's hard not to read most of the Fan mounts a critique... Creative decisions... taken by George Lucas. So this is what most hurts him. How I can invest so much time, energy and passion in this... BERND DOTZER editor and admirer If not... I was deeply moved from the beginning? I wanted to redo The Phantom Menace ... JACK MARSHALL editor and admirer Because the film... I felt horrible. In Wars original, no fart jokes... Stepping on poop... no CGI. In my mounting admirer, not find midi-chlorians. They are not part of my Star Wars . For me Star Wars moves... THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK Editor and admirer I did reduce... the duration of each episode... ... To create two films, one for each trilogy. For my "powdered version" I went back to frame each shot... And adapted the movies... a 4:3 aspect ratio... ... And changed the frame rate to 18 frames per second. I also added color casts... As each planet... where the action... ... Or the atmosphere of each scene. Birth of a nation of fans from of fascination and frustration. The assemblies of the fans are his standard. are an art form per se. FANEDIT.ORG HOME OF THE FANS ASSEMBLERS ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF THE SAGA MADE BY FANS ASSEMBLERS But it is art that dare not mention. there in the shadows. THE STAR WARS REVIEW There is a tiny group of fans... THE STAR WARS IMPROVED I threatened...... ADYWAN Editor and admirer Not to touch... Wars . It is not my movie and I can not touch it. How do I dare? But the most frightening was when some threatened to kill me. If you do not like my version, not the look. See the original. Jambe PRODUCTIONS DAVDAR A FAN FOR FANS I do not mind mounts and remixes from fans. It is an absolutely legitimate and great art meet. I told them to calm down! But I do not think than any of those fans... ... has the right hitting my door... ... and say, "I hate this character. I want it out of your book. " Because I say I do... For so I thought... and leave me alone. How are you, Lord Vader? Where is Padme? Is it OK? I fear for your anger you killed her. For God's sake, George, you fix the end... ... Where Vader says: - "No!" - No! No! No! No! This is a crucial scene and ruined. How do you fix it? I think it would be better Vader was there... ... Shouting with all their might so... And then could sprout Sparks from the throat... As he appears... a new voice box. That would be much more effective. People will wanting to make their mark... ... in the things you love... Fix things... and they hate on what they love. Did it make sense? We all know that our be more participatory culture. What danger are the terms of our participation. Lucas and Lucasfilm will give more control to the fans... Order to survive... and remain valuable as means. Take Alice in Wonderland . During the first 20 years after its publication... ... there were over 200 books published and sold... ... who took the Wonderland and its characters and expanded. And literary critics believe maybe that's why this story... ... Just like the Bible and Shakespeare... ... Is still the most cited work in English... Lewis Carroll accepted... because transformation in its history. It is the greatest defender of the fans. Has anyone pursued to make a montage? Not at all. THE CHALLENGE OFFICIAL FANS THE WARS OF 2009 presents a contest for fans. It offers a library of sounds. Lucas has been much more gentle with their fans... MATTHEW J. SMITH Chair, Communication Studies Wittenberg University ... From what they have tolerated it. We want the authors of our texts die... ... So you have total control on them... Without being told... never what to do with the text. We like the idea that there are magical beings... That create wonderful things... and then we leave them... ... So that we have them. This he did, whatever invented... ... Is no longer under their control. It's like fighting the final battle. DOUGLAS AR Director of LiningUp TV Fans will never win. I think we should tear the film of the hands of Lucas. Do you want your Star Wars ? Eat it. People do not know my middle name is "W". - So I'm the other GW. - Yes I am more than that decides, I am the creator. - You are the creator. - I'm George "G" capitalized. - I can see. - Yes From the point of view of control, belongs to George Lucas. Controls how the fans will... ... Under what conditions will be. And they must accept it. Control their image. Made a fatal mistake... ... And did everything possible to erase it. It was the Christmas Special The Star Wars . SPECIAL HOLIDAY THE STAR WARS The story, who for years denied their existence. When Lucas occasionally recognizes that there... Generally... says: "If I could track all the copies... ... And destroy them with a hammer, I would. " It is the worst television material ever created. The concept of this special... Chewbacca... is that you must re- to his home planet, Kashyyyk... Day... for life which is the feast of the Wookiee planet. Happy life, man. At least 20 minutes of the special two hours... ... occur within the home Chewbacca... What were they smoking? People tuned in to see... JOHN HOLDERRIED Animation producer Half hour of characters... that is growling. It's surreal. The grandfather of the clan, Itchy... ... it gets kind of old... ... and you can see a hologram Diahann Carroll of singing. pornography is a kind of galaxy. We're excited, right? How many people saw Christmas Special The Star Wars ? In some cultures, is a war crime. Very soon realized that this was damaging... Luke... the image and brand Wars ... ... And tried to remove it history. Without success. Here is my copy perfectly legitimate... ... The Holiday Special of Star Wars . If it looks like a digital copy of a VHS poorly coded... ... To Internet format, is an effect of the lens. It's part of history of Wars . It's like the Holy Grail. It is finding Bigfoot or the monster of Loch Ness. It's like finding the sex video of your parents. Should exist as the cultural highlight of the seventies. Must be in a museum. Christmas 2008, announced that the Paley Center... ... that is a museum dedicated the history of television... ... do an online interview... ... what was the special Christmas favorite people. And emit the five most votes. Was Charlie Brown Christmas ... ... Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frosty that. The Christmas Special of The Star Wars swept . Seeing the survey thought "Even if he wins... No way... that Luke let emit it. " another copy turned out to be illegitimate with commercials intact. Christmas special draws Lucas attention... ... because if the controller all... ... and omniscient creator of the universe... ... To let things is out of control... Indicates... that is not as driver neither absolute nor omniscient creator. EPISODE FOUR A NEW HOPE? We all get obsessed with something. Will it end the obsession by Wars ? I do not know. How long can you see a grater and cheese tasting to follow you? - I never saw Episode III . - Never saw... She felt very neglected not see Episode III . So I see that it is impossible cut the string. I left it completely. I burned all my toys. I had no toys. - But to have them... - The would burn... I do not like this. I especially like Droid Wars . What did George Lucas what I enjoyed... ... It was horrible. One of the worst things you can do a "nerd", pardon the word... Much love... is when something... ... To compete with others, come to hate it. You think things can not be this bad... LUKE "TMK" CUNNINGHAM Indiana Jones fan ... But it gets worse and worse. Christopher Valin Dissatisfied Customer George, you must admit your mistake. You walk... By a long pier... HUGH THOMAS Hughs News ... Because your movies are the worst... ... I've seen. You were very good. nerd love eats the tail like a snake biting its tail. And all the love that motivated this nerd... Internet... for speaking out of Wars ... ... Has been transformed. And they are as Sith Lords. They are consumed by their hatred for this film. You know you are followers... Much... because they hate to Wars . I give it all for you. I watch your movies. Buy your toys. Even I burned my copy of Christmas special to make you happy. How do you thank me? Do the fans of this film need to overcome? Not necessarily. There are professionals. At the Cannes Film Festival... At the premiere... Indiana Jones 4... ... To finish the film, someone stood up and shouted: "George, you should stop us harm." Is interesting that Spielberg did not mention... Have thought... but immediately Luke. Indiana Jones survives a nuclear explosion in a fridge. Some people that hangs from vines like Tarzan. And no damn aliens. What the hell? They did an episode of South Park ... Where kids... speak with ambiguity... ... On a violation that occurred in the city. They are sad and upset. What happened, happened. We can not change it. - We must overcome. - Get over it? They raped our friend, Stan. And as you ask the public: "Who raped?" And then you realize. Indiana Jones, you look good. Lucas and Spielberg graphically are raping Indiana Jones. Bring memories Deliverance United States is intense. SUZUKI MITSUTOSHI Club of fans of Indiana Jones, Japan We could not do that here in Japan. I took a couple of my entertainers... Eric Stough Animation director South Park ... South Park , and went to see her. We feel that George Lucas Steven Spielberg and... ... they treated us like idiots. Why did you do that to Indiana Jones? The episode of South Park was actually greater impact... The fans... that Indiana Jones 4 . BRANDON KLEYLA Director of Indyfans We believe that this was his closing. We feel the same as the boys. We have not talked about it since it happened. What do you think Lucas on that episode of South Park ? George, what do you think? No matter what I think. What do you say? When I think of Luke, I think Captain EO . When I think Captain EO , I think of Michael Jackson. So when I think Michael Jackson... Disneyland... I think. When I think of Michael Jackson... I think... and George Lucas and Captain EO ... ... And Disneyland I think of my childhood. Then I go into a strange place... George Lucas... where, my childhood and Michael Jackson. G.L. - I - M.J. By God! I was at a convention and saw some guys selling a shirt... ... That said: "George Lucas raped my childhood". Is there a song: "George Lucas raped my childhood "? # George Lucas raped our childhood # # George Lucas raped our childhood # # George Lucas raped our childhood# Nobody violated my childhood, much less George Lucas. And frankly, if a course George Lucas... I would like to have sex... Metaphorical... with my childhood... Would be a beautiful relationship... consensual sexual. I do not think you can say: "George Lucas ruined my childhood"... ... Because you still live your childhood. You act like a child. What took you children? Did you buy toys? Did you have fun? Were you inspired? Shut up. Not drinking characters and doing terrible things to them. Or maybe, yes. Although we deserved. Why were dressed like... ... in that part of the city, at night... ... if we were not asking for trouble? And in the mind of George, gave us what we wanted. He gave us new movies. We do not ask them to be good. Just ask Wars . One can say George Lucas is a seducer. I would say that the battered woman better example. bad Dad is hitting us... ... but still go to him for us to stick a little more. - Come with me. - No! - How to ruin your life? - Because it's a terrible story. When I was in the movie, I thought: "Damn, there goes... My childhood... ". It was exciting. Leave to indict this man lying to himself... ... Or to deceive, or ruin our fun... ... Or all that. But just because I mocked him in my comic strip and I want to sue me. I think we are so annoying... Franchise... because the War of galaxies represents something. This is what we recall as the most pure... In terms of experience... film. Is the base. There are no villains in this story. For us as fans, is better have an executive to blame... But we do not... ... We realize that George is the executive and creative. There are many mixed feelings. Luke's own career is as the rise and fall of Anakin.
