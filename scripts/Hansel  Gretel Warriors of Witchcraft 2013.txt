Yeah, tell me about it. - Good morning ladies. Jeff, good morning. Help Sheriff. What are you reading? - This is a book about Europe. We are planning a trip this summer. I made some notes of places where I want. - Europe, eh? Why not take someone with you. It is dangerous to travel alone. Yeah, but I can take care of myself. - Yeah, I know. You know why I'm here? Let me guess. One of my famous meat pies? Yes, ma'am. - He's coming. Have you heard the latest news? There is a kid missing, a town away. No, not again. - Probably ran away or something. Yes, ma'am, thank you. And deputy, what do you want. - Nothing for me, thank you, I'm on a diet. That's just weird, men should not diets. Women do like a bit stronger men. - Yeah, I heard. I'll take one of these. - A good choice. I'll get some milk for there. Here you go, honey. Close tightly when you're done. Thanks again that we may continue. - You know I trust you. You will always be so good for the store. Please Daddy, your favorite. - I think that's good, it's delicious. It is delicious. - Have you heard anything from your brother? No, still nothing. Who is now somewhere in Pakistan occupied. I see you every hidden corner. Left. So I'm sixty of those bastards. Sorry, I got held up. those commies take the entire Middle East on. And my best marksman was caught in saving such a beautiful hunk ... and a large, well ... What's going on people? We wanted to wait for you with the food, but we did not. Because it took too long. So here we are. I lost track of time, sorry. What? Jesus. Now here we are, Dad, what's the big news? Are you ready? - You tell me. We're getting married. You're kidding, right? - I love you very much dad and you have grown so we go ... from Candlewood leave. We are going to sell the house. We are going to buy a boat and travel around the world. I'm happy for you, Daddy. - Thank you, darling. Wait, how is that with my college in three weeks? How long I will try all to college to get? Dad, do you fucking kidding me? - You're a smart boy. Very intelligent. - How many times have we talked about? My left brain is far too complex a structured environment. And now you throw me out of the house? - So you should not see. We just want some time ... - You are now big kids. And then Menkay and my room? It is also my home, Dad. I need your support, blood is thicker and water ... She is three years older than me. You barely know her. This is bullshit, man. That went well. - I thought so I'll talk to him. - Okay. Hansel, stop, okay? - What? What the hell is wrong with you? You're acting like a spoiled child. I bet they already from the beginning plant. She has a kind of witches power over Dad since they met. - Daddy, is lonely, Hansel. Did you ever think of that, no. Because you're so selfish. Ruby, cares about him and they want to be together. And you should not be silly to do. So now I'm still a dick? You do not have to lecture. You're not mommy. - I'm just asking you to be reasonable. Do not be a fool. - You can just add to the list. You know what, let them get the colre. And you also get the back and forth. Hansel ... Dad. - Yes. You stay with Ruby, okay? I'll get him. I think I know where he's going. I know I am no friend of Ruby, but I see how much she means to you. Hansel gives himself still Mom's fault. I know. - I'll talk to him, okay? Congratulations. Leave him alone. - I do not, I talk to him. Okay, go ahead. - Okay. Hansel ... Hansel ... Selfish. I'm not selfish. It's dad, who is selfish. - Hansel ... Ruby is a stupid name. - Where are you? Gretel. - Hansel. Hurry up. - Hansel. My God. Okay, calm down, okay? It hurts so much. But pain is good. Then there is no nerve damage. How do you know? - I watch too much TV. Look at me, I want you to concentrate. I open it and pull your leg out, okay? No, that's a very bad idea. - Hansel, I must do it. Hold still. - Okay. One, two ... I got him ... We gotta go. I think I see a hut. Stay here and I'll get help. No, are you serious? You do not leave me here in the woods behind, okay? Where a wild animal can bite my balls. - Can you walk? Of course I can walk. - Hold on. I can not walk, help me. I got you, right as she goes. Come on. Be careful where you walk. Lillith, is this your house? I thought you lived in the village. This is an old family home. But what is going on? Hansel is injured, we need help. - Honey, come on. Thank you. - Of course. I can not believe you live here. I am sorry How's your leg now? It still hurts when ... honey. I think I have something that will help. Try here but one. Magic candy. That is my secret recipe. - What's in here? Trust me, I'll take them for my own cataracts. Gretel, honey, I'm so sorry. I forgot you are a vegetarian. I do not need anything, really. - Are you kidding me? This is just incredible. What is this meat? The juiciest kind. Lillith, thanks again. I do not know what we should do without you. Probably bleed to death, I guarantee you. I think you should eat some more, How about a cake? Never mind, I'm not hungry. - Try it, it's great stuff. Lillith, is that you in this picture? Yes, long ago. That's my boy, it's twins. Just like you and Hansel. - Who's that baby? That's my little Abigail, my little bird. She did not make it. I'm sorry. - She was just ... born weak. The world was too much for her tiny body. Dear God. - Bless him, he's just exhausted. Whether it is a food coma. - Hansel? Baby, we'll go lie down. Sorry sweetheart. - What good. I can not believe it. - Beware we try to walk. You may be best to sleep. My house is your house. We really need to go Lillith, you were great. I do not even bother. Nonsense, I just did not say that all of you is mine. You can have my room, while the forest is very dangerous at night Hansel as already noticed. We bring him morning to the hospital. Well, if you insist, but you Lillith, where you sleep then? Honey, I do not sleep much these days, I know not whether I ever wake up. Would you like some tea? - That would be nice. Who is that? - That's my brother Nathan. Do you have a brother? Something that I've never known. I do not talk so much about. Let say that we could not handle. May I ask where he is now? He is deceased. A very long time ago. - I'm sorry. Please, darling. Please. You two look so much like your mother. - That's what Dad always says. You must miss her very much. - I remember her not so good. But I do miss the thoughts of her. It is difficult for Hansel. He has since a weight on his shoulders. Why is that so? She took medication for him. He blames himself. - I understand. We all have our burdens to bear and we 're all differently. What do you think? It's my special blend. It's nice, it's very sweet. Are you okay? Yeah, but I just feel a little dizzy. You have a difficult life Gretel. It is good that you keep sleep. Hello, good morning. How do you feel? Where is Hansel? A neighbor took him this morning the hospital. I tried to wake but you were so exhausted I gotta go, I gotta be with him. He can not take care of himself. Once the neighbor's back I let him take away yours. I have a terrible headache. - I have something for. Please. Here, only one of these suction. Good against head and stomach. You know, honey, you'd probably feel better if you took a shower. Yeah, maybe. I have nothing for me to dress. - I have plenty of things that will suit you. God, my stomach. No, it's okay, you do not need to be afraid. - You would most certainly should be. Kevin, quiet please. Hi, I'm Jane. What is your name? I'm Hansel. Where the hell are we? We do not know where we are. They have you last night introduced. You were very far away. Do you have a strange taste in your mouth? Yes, I have. - Does the medicine with you. There were more of us but you are now the fourth. Four, what is this? - You're one of us now. I'm a what? Food. What is going on? What happens? Let me out. What happens? - You should eat something before it is. What, how can you eat that? - That we do not want, but ... It makes you more appetites. - Can you maybe stop and me fucking tell what's going on? We are meat - We do not know, Kevin. Yes, we know, it is a sum. You have no proof - Jane, just want to see the truth. That we are animals, they fatten us and take us through that door. And everything you still hear is screaming. Terrible screams. They will not even wait I've fattened up. Meat, that's what we are. But that does not stop me from Meanwhile enjoy. No. Leave her alone. Help. Gretel, honey, can you come here? I want to show you something. Lillith, I must go now. I mean I ... Do you know what this is? It is the ownership of the bakery. Do you know why I let you see? Does this mean what I think it means? - Yeah, he's yours. I let the gingerbread house to you after so you can put it forth. After I'm gone. - But your kids? I mean why would not they ... - I do not trust them for a penny. But you, the moment I met you I knew he had to be yours. Lillith, I do not know what ... - You just need to sign it. That's all you need to do and then it's official. Okay ... The point is that I do not know if I rest of my life at Candlewood wants to stay. I understand, dear, I do. But this sign means only that legally yours and if you do not want the responsibility, I trust that you find someone. I can not do, this is your baby. - It's yours. I do not want anyone else to have it. Only you. Please? Properly. Lillith, I'm sorry. - It's okay. Let me get you a link. Gretel You're wasting your time. - We've all tried. What are you doing with her? Thanks for sweeping, that you really should not have. It's the least I can do. Is everything all right? - Prima. I have a moment something nice for your and then some girl talk, okay? Okay, great. - What are you doing? So I should just sit here and that poison food and wait until I get eaten. - What, you got a better idea? Yes, not eaten, that plan. I must find her and care that she's okay. Was she with you when you were drugged? - Was she a big girl? Maybe she already ate. They love thick girls. Since they keep very much. - Shut the fuck, Kevin. I bet she comes back. She let me not die. I'll be back, I'm going to get some glaze. Gretel? - My God. Hansel? Hansel? - That's her. Gretel. That's a shame. - Gretel, help. I'm down here, please help. - Lillith, what happens? What is happening? That now it will have to bear. That is if we remain polite to each other. Leave her alone. What? Wait a minute. Why is Hansel in your basement? - Put the cuffs on. No, answer me, what happens? What are you doing with him? With him? Nothing yet. I'm here. Behind you. / I Around, turn and turn. And you know when we stop? Only knows Lillith. Calm down, calm down. You know what? I had hoped that this would be an enjoyable experience. Well. - I'm down here. I am sorry - No, I know she can hear me. Gretel, help. I'm down here, please help. Okay, can you let me know if you see one of them? Great, thank you Sassie. What's going on, Ruby? You have not seen them since last night? There disappearing youth, right? Maybe there is something happened to them. There was not much to be wrong, as Gretel not responsible. That is so. She had her father let them know where they are. Especially if something had happened. - We'll be careful, okay? They're good guys, I will personally my eyes wide open. We'll find them. As easily as my cakes. I'd like to teach you things. You see things. And you should have trusted me, so that I could trust you. Please, let us go. - Shut up. I've heard it all before. Gretel, these are my sons, John and Bobby. Just like the Kennedys. They are my family. I wish that you were a part of the family was, would you want to? No. I'll give you some time to reconsider that. But now, it's lunch time, not boys? Gretel, will you come help me with lunch? Please, Gretel. Listen to me. You are not cattle like the rest. Let me tell you not treat, please. Come help me set the table. Please do How's your leg? - It gets worse. The painkillers that old witch become elaborated. I'm really sorry. - I wish I could give you something. Yeah, me too. Why have I never in town? I'm not from here. I'm from Ohio. I was on my way to New York, you know big plans, a big city. You sound just like my sister. They would also road and everyone behind. Why the big city, NewYork why? When I was three I started playing the piano. I always wanted to be a concert pianist be in NewYork. My father always said I would not make it. Your father is an asshole and we get out of here, okay? I think I can get this lock open if I have something that is sharp enough. Please, tell me you're a locksmith. No, but I watch a lot of TV and that is sometimes useful. What do you think of this? - Yes, perfectly. Almost. - No. I'm sorry it did not work. - I would like to have something that is sharper. You know, I'm not afraid anymore. I tell myself that at least and it seems to help. We come here, okay? Listen to me, I promise that we come here. How can you be so sure? - Because I do not want to die down here. Not now, not ... Trust me, I've big plans and I'll take you. Okay? And no bastard of a father or disturbed bitch take that away from you. Trust me. But to fall. Use your fork. Attack. - I'm not hungry. That will have to change, from now on eat what I tell you to eat and when I tell you to eat it. Then we will be fine together. Eat now. - I'm not hungry. You know, Nathan listened not to me. And now his little boy without a father. A surprised little bird. I ensured that it seemed that he really did not want to live, right? Look, your brothers love, to fall. They are not brothers. - That they are now, eating. No, I do not. - Food, damn. Go to hell. Behind her, bring her back. You too. Well done guys, well done. If you like an animal behaves you will eat like an animal. Eat it on, it has power. - Get off me. Open your mouth. Good. You will be stronger than ever been. Yeah, chew on it. Just like Dana, she was young and put. How is she? Why have I so misjudged? I thought you were special. I thought you were like me. Bring her down, with the others. She is too weak to your sister. Hello buddy, what are you doing? - Looking for a punch line, where they went. Do you know where this is? I know it's somewhere in the forests. Their mother took them along sometimes there. They called it the hand tree. It was their special place, where daddy's not allowed to come. That a good place to start. - Yeah, I guess you're right. What is that? Are you okay? Did they hurt you? Why are you doing this to us? No, please. Suit. No, stop it Why did she do that? Why would they want to challenge them? - To save us. I think they're gone. That will not be true? let me go. / i Let me go, no. / i It's this way. - No, he goes from here. I listened to everything they do. I know everything they do. I know more about this house than they think. - Yes, but they have Jane brought there. We must first save her. - I find very nice January but if we move in the direction we all four die. This way and there will be three of us survive. No, stop, no. / i My God. - I do not think it's possible. But I will send help. - Success. Maybe he's right. - No, we can not leave her. We would not be without her free. Properly. - We have to help her. Let's go. What's up, freak? - The sheriff says that you know well the forests. Yes, quite, almost like my pocket. - Do you know where this is? Yes, that is in Fells Point. Shall I take you there? No, you stay but look, we'll go. - Are you sure? Yes. - Okay, that'll come forth, complaining. Thank you. Let us through worms. How's your leg? - It's like I do not think. Okay, that's good. - Good. John coming in, I need you, now. I need to remove traces. - You take them, right? Make them feel how things stand at and then we have a real party tonight. Make Mom proud, forward. I can not believe that her children kept locked up here for years. His guests her children? What the hell is that? John? Come on, hurry up. Are you sure this is it? - Jerry, seemed sure of himself. No, please. I do not know. Wait. She is here, come on. - Do Hansel. That's the plan, okay? I do not think we save. We murder them all. So she nobody ever can do. Come. It's okay, look at me. It was what you had to do, okay? It was him or us. Jane shoots, make her loose, cut. Careful. It is good. Lillith? Hello? Lillith? Hello? Help Sheriff. - Jesus. Sorry. - I'm all day looking for you. Why the hell? - Hansel and Gretel, are missing. And you're close to Gretel, so I thought maybe you knew where they could be. I think this might can provide clarity. It is pushed under the door, and found it when I came. This is not the handwriting of Gretel. Why are you closed today, Lillith? - I just need a day off. That's the great thing about having your own business. Did you cut yourself? - Good heavens, no. I was home meat pies to making and I slipped. You wanna stay here, I'll call the sheriff. You know, I really hurry. - He'll want to talk. Deputy Sheriff Carter Mackiss. Deputy Sheriff Carter Mackiss, can you hear me? You do not have to bother. - Hi, I'm Jerry. I'm in the Ginger Bread House with Lillith and ... Gretel, this way. She is weak, Hansel, we must stopping to rest. No, we must go on, come on. Gretel? - I'm so tired. Do you want to die? Come on. Help me. - She wants us something. What is that? - My eyes burn. I see nothing. Where are you? I'm fucking delicious. Hansel, help me. / i - Gretel? Where are you? / i - Gretel? Gretel, I'm coming. Gretel? Sit up straight, Jane. / i - Dad? Daddy, where are you? You can not make it, Jane. Dad, think. / I I need your help. - Jane, let your protection bags. / I Tell him I will. You are fooled. - I do not know. / I Do not you see? - Dad ... / i You can not make it. Dad, I will not fail you, I promise. / I How do I get out? / i - You can not make it, accept it. You will not make it. You're a loser. - No. / i That is always so. - No, that is not so. / I Give it up. I am so disappointed. - No, you're not. / I You no matter what I do. I'm coming out. You're trapped. Escape is impossible. You are mine. Now. Leave me alone. No please, leave me alone. You have nowhere else to go now. - Please. I think I love you in the house. I think it was one of her tricks. My God. Here she cooked them. How many do you think there have been here? - Too many. She makes the meat pies for years. - I found her delicious meat pies. Jane, no. Jane? She is dead. Come. It's locked. He has no keys. Hansel, it's not good. If you are in can, you can too. I see an opening, it looks big enough there to crawl through. It seems too small. Here. You're going the wrong way. - Come, so we come out. This is surely wrong way. I was wondering if you ... / i With Jerry, I'm the Ginger Bread with Lillith and ... / i Dear God. Ruby. Ruby, come here. What the fuck is this? - Hansel? Gretel? Hansel? Jerry? / i Are you here? Jerry? Hello? Is there anyone here? I've never seen this house, you know? No, I do not. I mean, it's scary. Is there anyone here? Hello? Do you see how it looks here. That's Herbie, that's Lillith's car. I thought she lived in town, come. Maybe she knows where they are. Ruby that's her car, Lillith's car, my God. They are here, we need to find and then get out. In your dreams. Where are my children? - I do not have time for. You too. My God. - Help me. My God, I'll get help. It's okay, I'll get help. - She's going to eat them. What, who? - Other youth. Which children, where are they, where? - They're all dead. Which others, where are they? Hang in there, okay? In ... hut ... old woman. Young man? Jesus. This is Mackiss, is there anyone? Sheriff Mackiss, is there anyone? - Central, what's the problem, Sheriff? Hello, this is Woody Look, I need a paramedic required. I have a guy hit. Wait, do you hear that? He is here with us. Come, now, fast forward. Forward now. Hansel, look. Can you climb? Yes, we will. - Come forward. Quiet. - I'll give you a push, okay? Hurry up, Hansel, hurry up. - It works. Listen, I'm here to get away, I am probably back before you get there. - Over and out. ... all available units on Bellfort ... / i Forward now. - My God, Ruby. Just now now, step. Step. Come on, let's go. I do not know. Here she comes. We gotta go. I can not get up. Let her go. Get out. Dad. That can not be true. A dead end? Hurry, grab them. How do we get out of here now? - We have to keep moving. You will not get far with that leg. - We can explore. Ensuring that we have the right direction and not circling. Come. Where did you learn that? - In the fifth grade, Ms. Graf. An old Indian Trick, original American. She has never liked me. Look me in that way. - What do you mean? Same look that Mom had if she was proud of me. I have not always been a stupid bastard. - I did not say that. It does not matter, but let me see. And ms Graf has told me anything, let's go. Here we are. Forward. Hurry up. Is he dead? - Of course he's not dead. Who is this guy anyway? - Family. Her family. - Let's go. Hold me okay? Is it? Yes, I will feel much better when I in a hospital with painkillers lie. With this pain? That's for sure. Come on. My God. Listen, there's help, They will be here as well. Gretel, I can pull it out. One, two ... Who are you? You can not go anywhere. - No. You're not getting away, Lillith. You've shot the sheriff. People will come. - Yes, I'm the deputy also killed. So we better hurry. Help your brother, come on. It's time for dinner. That is what. - Why are you doing this Lilith? Why do I do this? Because it works. Do you know how old I am? Hurry up, get up, come on. Come along, little doggies, get along. Inside. Over here, sit down. Here, look at this, look at the bottom. You see the date? When they called me a witch. You can have this, you can have it all. You deserve to live forever, Gretel. And I can show you how. I can give it to you Look, let him murder together. We take his heart and eat it. It is not flesh but youth. We eat youth. You will love it. Need it, believe me. No. - I understand. I wanted to save you, I wanted to learn all as it really is. But you're not worth it. You're the same as the rest, meat. Dom, meat. What is that stuff? - It cleans you, if possible. You, I always wanted you eat. Keep still or I'll cut your balls off and let you look at it. Lillith, for God's sake. - For God's sake? Who is God? Yours? He's just a sweet holder for the hopeless. What has he done for you lately? Yes. Hurry to the basement. Go now. We had to go through the front door. - Then we had not gone far with that idea, right? Trust me. Hurry up. I'm coming. Try us but to catch. Where are you? I'm here to eat. You'll never find us. - Where are you, little rascals? This is that opening, through this. "Now we do a circle dance. ' Gretel, honey. Why are you doing this? Come here, Gretel, come closer. You know why I have chosen you? Because you just as I am. I see it in your eyes. Come closer, honey. You do know what they do with witches, Lillith? They burn them. We burn them alive. Come on, we gotta get out of here, now. / i What the hell you doing in here? I thought you'd avoid like the plague. Yes, I had to pick up some things. Are you okay? - I think so. I do not know. Dad, come straight from the hospital, We pick him up and then we smear him. Shall I meet you there? I just need some time. Girl, you know I love you, right? I love you too. - See you there. Cause you're just like me ... / i I see it in your eyes ... / i No credits needed - I know who I am -
