Waiting to go into this forest and see whether I would come out a man or if I would come out at all. I can not tell you what will happen tonight. No two trials are exactly the same. Once this is over. One of you will come out in my place and I will remain here for the rest of my days. I want you to remember simply being chosen leader doesn't make you one. You have to earn it. As I hope I have in my time. Use your training. Stay focused. Do your parents proud. Good luck with that. There is one more rule we must all agree on before we begin. Whatever happens once we enter whatever decisions are made whatever events we face. Whatever decisions are made Once it is over, they stay here.

Every animal for thirty miles is going to smell him bleeding. Ares. No offence but you were always going to be a dead weight. What do you say Eiren? I'll give you a head start. What do you say Eiren? Let's finish this just me and you. What do you say Eiren? Or how about I slit your throat now and leave you both here. Or how about I slit your throat now How does that sound? Or how about I slit your throat now Eiren? Or how about I slit your throat now Nice try? But you literally don't have the balls. I'll leave you to it. And if you see me again. You will be kneeling at my feet as your new leader. And if you see me again. What a nice thought. And if you see me again. Get off. Why are we stopping? I've been dragging you through this forest for hours and your armpit smells. I've been dragging you through this forest for hours Rest for a while Ares is probably leader by now so there's no point killing ourselves for nothing. Are we climbing up? The tree? Are we climbing up? Don't be stupid. Are we climbing up? What are you looking at? Are we climbing up? Not looking. Are we climbing up? Listening. Are we climbing up? Arghhh.. Maybe we should rest over there. Congratulations Ares, you've made it to the birth place of our first leader. It is an honour. Eiren and Thade? Thade stood on a bear trap. Eiren stayed with him. Thade stood on a bear trap. And you didn't? Thade stood on a bear trap. No. Then we best call out for them don't you think? Why are you always so uptight? I'm just saying Nus would definitely choose you if you would just relax every now and then. I'm not a leader and Nus couldn't pick me even if I were. People would get over it eventually. Yeah right People would get over it eventually. An orphan as leader? People would get over it eventually. Then why spend the last eight years trying so hard? What else was I going to do? Right. Of course. They'd be proud of you. Shut up. They'd be proud of you. I'm just saying. Shut up Thade. Where? It's coming. Where? Weird. Weird. It's them. Get up. It's them. Why are they calling out for us? I though it was against the rules. Why are they calling out for us? I don't know. Why are they calling out for us? Save your energy Areas. It's been hours. Save your energy Areas. Why we still waiting. Save your energy Areas. Why wouldn't we wait? Save your energy Areas. Because you think finding this place makes you worthy of being the next leader? We haven't even started yet boy. Are you ok? So you didn't get eaten then? Eiren Tell me Aries why exactly didn't you stay to help one of your own? I.. Why exactly didn't you stay to help one of your own? He's a coward. I was asking him and not you. He's a coward. Because he is a fool. He would have gotten us all killed. Because he is a fool. You should be willing to die for your people. And you. You should be willing to die for your people. Whats your excuse? I saved him. Ares is right. I saved him. You could have gotten the hole group killed. I saved him. You act without thinking, that makes you as bad as Ares. I saved him. And you. You you are an idiot. So this is the pick of the litter. Then we might as we begin. Our ancestors came from this forest survivors of the old world who were already here when it fell. Survivors of the old world The story goes that the tribe argued over what they should do next and split into two groups. One went in search of the old world. The other group stayed and built the village in which you now stands. One went in search of the old world. They were happy for a time. But one night. While a fire burnt brightly. The others returned. Our men fought bravely but slowly they were butchered one by one. Until only the young boy's remains. One of those boy's Samuel, had always had a talent for hiding. Took what was left of our village and taught them to blend into the trees and hide in the forest until the others gave up and left. As dawn broke. Samuel led what was left of our people out of the forest and to our new home Varosha. No longer a boy. But a leader. No longer a boy. Tonight. You will make the same journey. Once this fire is lit. Anything could come out of the trees. Once this fire is lit. Or perhaps nothing will come at all. Once this fire is lit. Every trial is different and every group deals with the challenge differently. Every trial is different But in the end. One of you will emerge the new leader. One of you Light the fire. Well go on then. This is a man's honour Right? This is a man's honour That is right. Now what? We wait. Now what? Great. More waiting. Some things never change. You're still sitting on your own all the time, I see. I'm used to it. You know... I've always seen myself as a father to the whole tribe, but some more than others. I am grateful. Your father would be proud to see, that you have made it this far. It feels right, that I should end up going out the same way he did. I had to watch your father die in this place. I would rather I didn't have to go through the same with you. It feels right, that I should end up going out the same way he did. You should watch Ares tonight. Just as you remind me of your father, so he reminds me of his. Was it his father that killed mine? You know I can't tell you. Was it his father that killed mine? Why do you always have to be so righteous with me... And why do you always have to be so bad tempered? Why do you always have to be so righteous with me... This would be an easy competition, if you would just get over yourself. You're not my father. And you're no leader. Not yet anyway. Doesn't that piss you off? What? Nus. What? Treating that differently to us. He practically raised her She shouldn't even be here. Who's legacy does she even carry? All her family are already dead. Nus's decision is final Ares. If he chooses Eiren Tough shit. We'll see. I like her anyway. Nus was right. You are an idiot Where are you going? Please. Help me. Ares. What? Others. Then your trial has arrived. Please, their coming. Who is coming? Who is coming? Gods. Give us the girl and the box. We don't carry about the rest of you. You can go. I'll do it. I swear Please. You have to help me get rid of this box. Dead? Ares. What? I'm just looking. It's dangerous. So? Child. I don't think we should be messing with that Ares. Thade is right Ares. Leave it alone. Thade is right Ares. Why should I? What did you say? This is a trail, correct? So it is up to us, that is the rules. Your job, is to watch. Decide who you think should be the next leader. And you think I might choose you? No. I would not dream of it. You have already earmarked your princess over there. With that honour. Very well. You decide what you do next. But together as a group. If you want to be a leader Ares. You have to prove yourself. Thade. You go first. I think we should give them the girl and that box. Why should we get involved with this? What if they decide to come back. And kill us all. What if they decide to come back. After they have whatever it is. Well then we go before they come back. Leave the girl and the box here. Maybe I should have left you stuck in that trap earlier. How does waiting here to die because of a box we know nothing about make any sense? Maybe I should have left you stuck in that trap earlier. Maybe those others. Are watching us right now. As soon as we leave they will take the box. And follow us back to Varosha And kill the hole tribe. And follow us back to Varosha Well then what do you suggest? And follow us back to Varosha We keep the box. It is power. They are afraid of it. It is the only reason they ran off. And it is the only reason why we aren't dead yet. And what about her? She shows us how it use it. Otherwise we kill her. And you think this is the type of leader I should choose? Tell me Ares. After you have discovered what to do with whatever is in the box What will you do next? Perhaps you will think yourself a god too. You would prefer we spend the rest of our live answering to her. The orphan. You speak of tradition. But yet. You make the tribe pet our new leader. She is a disaster waiting to happen. And you know it. Eiren There she goes again. Just doing whatever she wants without asking anybody else. I was bored of your voice. Arrrghhh! Wahhhhh!!!! First we find out more. Then we decide what to do. See. You are ignorant. Just like your father was. Where is it? Where is it? Give her the box. Now. Who are you? Drink. Not all of it. Sorry. Eiren. You? Flynn. Who are you? Where are you from? Who are you? Why do you want to know that? Who are you? That's not important right now. Who were those men that followed you here? Three, Six and Nine. Named after the numbers on the box. They are gods? Named after the numbers on the box. That's what they say. Because of what is in the box. What is it? My people worship it. Whoever has the box rule the city. Who are the masked men? They are the chosen ones. Guardians of the box. I'm going to get rid of it forever tho. You could help me. Why? Please. My parents died to still this box. I have to finish it. How? No Eiren. You are not in charge. No Eiren. Eiren please. How? There's a lake. On other side of the forest. At the edge of the old world. It's where the box first came from. I'm going to throw it deep into the watch. This is a bad idea. This is your trial. This is your discussion. This is ball shit. You heard the woman. She comes from a great city. They know that we exist now. We need to box. It is the only reason why they will stay away. The box is the only reason why they will try and find us. It is the only reason why they will stay away. We need to leave now. And forget we ever saw this. We need to leave now. And how long do you think you would last with your leg like that? You need the box more than any of us. You left him in the first earlier. And now you care all of a sudden. You left him in the first earlier. Shut up Eiren. You left him in the first earlier. Or what? You left him in the first earlier. Quite. Both of you. What? Their back. Eeeekkkk! Open the box. Open the box. Give it. We need to hide. Eiren. Arrrghhh! BANG! Go, go now. This is mine. Thade. You. Are a lot harder to kill than your father was. He cried like a dog. Very amusing. Arrrghhh! And you taste better than he did too. BANG! Arrrghhh. Open your eye's Nus Don't die Not here. Bosses. Human after all. Your not ready. None of you are. From death. We are able to live. What does this mean? I don't know. He said you weren't ready. He didn't choose you. He said you weren't ready. He didn't choose us either. One of us has to earn it. How? Ok? Ok. Put it in the box. Why? Where is this lake of yours? I can show you. How do we earn it? We get rid of that box. Journey well brother. You ok? Yeah. How far? I'm not sure. I don't recognise where I am. Just take a moment. No. No stopping. She's not your pet, back off. She's going to get us all killed. She's injured no thanks to you. She's going to get us all killed. I will be ok. We should carry on. I will be ok. You do not get to decide when and where we stop. You are not the leader. Neither are you. We should take the box Go back home, kill the three masked men. We should take the box But no we die out here for this other. This box. Will never come back to Varosha. Says who? You? Where's the other one? Thade? Open the box. Shut up. Open the box. Thade. Hey. You are an idiot. Not you too. We should all stick together. I found something. I've never seen anything like it. Weapon? No, no i don't think so. What is it? No idea. It's old world tho. At least we know we are heading in the right direction. Good. You lead for a while. My pleasure. Was he your father? No. Was he your father? But close. My parents died years ago. How? My mother died when I was born. My father died here is these trials. I'm sorry. Did they kill your parents? How? After the raid, they knew they had been followed. So they gave me the box. And told me to head to the old world and throw it in the lake. At first I did as I was told. But I couldn't leave them. So I hide the box in the forest and went back. It was too late tho. Nine had killed them all. I saw my mother with her throat slit. They hit me with a spear a day ago. If I had never gone back they would have had no idea and I would have thrown this thing in the lake by now. If I had never gone back they would have had no idea Let me see. Is it bad? Yeah. Am I going to be ok? Thade. How is your foot? Thade. Like you care. We must face facts. It's rare anyone make it alive out of these trials Other than the leader. You really want to die tonight? Look All I'm saying is how much of a chance do you think you have with your foot like that against the others? What can I do? Help me become leader. We take the box. We go home safely and stay that way. You must see that by now. No Ares. That is not earning it. Says who? Nus. Nus is dead Thade. And so are we if we don't do something. Why should I help you be leader? Look at you. You are not cut out for this. And neither is she. You have seen her temper. She will get the hole tribe killed eventually. Thade. I see your face. You see the power. You liked it. How? WE split them up. You distract Eiren. I'll take the box from the other. No killing anyone. She's already dead. As for Eiren. No killing Eirens. Or I'm out. We must protector her understand? Understand? Come with me. Can you run? Go. We need to go back and stop Ares. Why? We need to go back and stop Ares. I'm so sorry. Thade! I'm sorry. What for? Ares. He wants to box. He's going to kill her? I knew. Your an idiot. I didn't want to die. It's ok. I would have chosen you. Arrrghhh... Back off. Arghhh. It's ok. What are you doing? What am I doing? What are you doing? Look at you. You are no leader. Where is Thade? We are dying out here. Where is Thade? And for what? This other. I'm going to take the box. And i'll use it on you if I have to. We can go back to the camp. Tell them bus picked me. And I might let you live. Sounds great i'll pass. Why don't you think this through for once. Believe me for once I am. Or I would have killed you already. You kill me. I don't think so. Maybe he can help. CRACH! Get up. I'm done. Take the box. Throw it deep into the lake. For my parents. It's ok. I'm here.
