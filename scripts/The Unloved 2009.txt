When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Where have you been? I went to the shop. Huh? [ Clears Throat ] You've been away for hours. Where have you been? Just went to the shop. I got distracted. Look, Lucy-- I'm sorry. I've been waiting for you, baby, you know. I've been waiting for you for two hours now, you know. Where have you been? The shop's round the corner. Where have you been? I'm sorry, but I just went to the shop, and I-- Stop saying you're sorry. Stop saying you're sorry. Just be honest with me. Where have you been? I just got distracted. Where's my cigarettes? Couldn't find the money. What? I was walking there, and then I got to the shop and it's-- I couldn't find the money in my-- Where's the money? Lucy, I gave you the money. I gave you five pounds. Where's the money? I'm sorry, but I just-- Stop-- Stop fucking saying "sorry." Where is the money? I don't know. You've either got the cigarettes or you've got the money, Lucy. Where is it? I've not got it. [ Sighs ] What are you doing to me? I didn't mean to-- What are you doing this to me for? I didn't mean to-- Just be fucking honest with me! Did you spend the money? No, I didn't. You spent the money, didn't you? I didn't! You been away with your pals and you spent the money. I've been sitting here waiting. [ Whimpering ] I didn't. I promise. You did! You did! You don't just fucking lose money like that. That's all we had. That's all we had. What am I gonna do? What am I to do with you now? You're gonna make me angry. You're making me angry now. You're making me angry now. You've got one last chance. Where's the money? Where's the fucking money? [ Whimpering, Sniffling ] I don't know. Don't lie to me, Lucy. Last time. Where's the money? I'm sorry, but I don't know! I don't want to do this to you. I don't want to do this to you. Tell me where the fucking money is! [ Whimpering ] What did you do with the money? Where did you put it? Did you smoke the cigarettes? Are you smoking the cigarettes? No! [ Blows Landing On Wall ] What am I supposed to do? [ Father Gasping ] [ Lucy Whimpering ] [ Father ] Shut up! [ Belt Hitting Lucy ] [ Father Whimpering ] You gotta learn. [ Teacher ] Okay, year six. Thank you very much. That's great. If you'd like to come to the end of your writing now, we're going to finish your family biographies tomorrow. I can't wait to read them. So close your books, get your P.E. kits and get dressed as quickly as possible. We're going for P.E. in the hall. [ Children Chattering, Complaining ] Quietly, thank you! Lucy, do you want to go and get your P.E. bag? I forgot to bring my P.E. kit. You forgot to bring your P.E. kit? But you forgot to bring it last week as well, Lucy. Why did you forget? I just left it at home. You just left it at home. I need you to bring your P.E. bag in, 'cause I need you to do P.E. Okay, so next week will you bring it in for me? Put your book back in your tray. You're going to have to sit out this one. Sit at the side of the hall with Miss Jones. [ Chattering, Shouting ] [ Teacher ] Okay, now once you've got that, I want you to pick a different three parts of your body to walk around. But I want you to do it together. Some of you have started to split up. Okay, work together. Choose another three parts of the body. Try and pick three parts that you haven't used already. Uh, you shouldn't be sitting around talking. I want to see you moving around the room. [ Teacher, Children ] Bless us, O God, as we sit together. Bless the food that we eat today. Bless the hands that make the food. Bless us, O God. Amen. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. [ Loud Chattering ] [ Chattering Fades ] Come and sit down, Lucy. You all right? Do you want to tell Mrs. Dales what you said to me? I want to phone my social worker, please. [ Door Opens ] Would you like to come through? We're just in here. Thanks. [ Woman ] Are you okay? Yeah. We don't think it's a good idea that you should go home to your daddy's at the moment. Can I go and see my mummy? That's not a good idea either. So what I'm going to do is take you to a children's home today... until we can find you a foster home. Okay? What about my other foster parents and family and that? That's not an option at the moment, I'm afraid. [ Birds Squawking ] [ Doorbell Jingling ] Hello? Who is it? Can I speak to a member of staff, please? No. Can you go and get me a member of staff, please? [ Boy ] No. [ Man ] Connor! Excuse me. Hiya. Jackie Taylor, social worker. You should have got my call, yeah? I did. Hi. It's Johann. Nice to meet you. How you doing? Come in, Lucy. Sorry about the wait. I was in the other room. Just go on straight through. The office is straight that way.

[ Jackie ] I'll drop them off for you later. I've got a few details that you'll need as regards to medication and stuff... I've not actually managed to pick up yet. [ Overlapping Conversations, Indistinct ] [ Woman ] I can't make heads or tails of what you've written.

Do you know what I mean? - Of course you do. - I'm an adult. Darren? [ Darren ] Huh? Are you on shift? Yeah, I've just started. Just having my cup of tea. Well, you're supposed to have-- Let me say one thing. Sorry. A minute, Lauren. You're supposed to have your tea before you come on shift. I'm to share with some other fucking person? No. No! I'm not doing it! You're always looking for a bit of respect. I ain't fucking doing it! You always keep saying, "Treat me like an adult." I'm not doing it! Go on. Just follow Lauren.

[ Humming ] I'm invisible I'm invisible Go, boy [ Lauren Laughing ] Do you know who Gloria Gaynor is? You look like her. Well, this obviously dates back some little while... because it's got "per quarter, sixpence"-- [ Woman ] Yes. You'd get a lot, wouldn't you, for sixpence? [ Woman ] You would. You would indeed. Two and a half P, yes? [ Man ] I would date this probably to the start of the 1930s. [ Woman ] Right, yes. I can see the deco influence. [ Man ] Exactly. Exactly. It has that sort of eau-de-ness feel about it, doesn't it? Yeah. I love the idea of putting this rock in. It's so brilliantly colored. And did you have this in the kitchen? Oh, we've had it all over. So what are you doing tomorrow then? Do you want to go into town? Yeah. I haven't got any bus fare though. I'll sort that out. [ Sighs, Clears Throat ] Lauren? What?

Oh, this looks really nice on you. Yeah? Come on then. [ Lauren ] Come on. [ Woman ] How's your other daughter? [ Man ] What? I'm just asking. How's your other daughter? This has got nothing to do with that. W-Why? It just doesn't. Well, I'm just asking. You're fucking twisting it. I'm not twisting anything. Yeah, you are. You just fucking twisted it. Why don't you just tell her that you love her. And you can't do that. That's not true. How is it with-- It's fucked. It's fucked. Okay? What's her name? Why? Why? Why?

You think we're the same people? I watched you. I know it's the same people. Are you sure? Bit arrogant, you are, aren't you? Not really, no. I'm just-- I don't know. I watched you. You put something in your pocket. I swear I haven't done anything. You've got two choices. You empty your pockets, or else the police are called. You'll be locked up. I'm just saying that I haven't done anything. You have. I saw you. I haven't done anything. Could you tell me what your name is? [ Lauren ] No. We can do it the easy way or the hard way, 'cause the police are gonna get called. [ Lauren ] And what are the police gonna do? [ Officer ] They're going to arrest you, sweetheart, 'cause you've been shoplifting. [ Lauren ] The only thing they can do is keep me up there for about 20 minutes, half an hour. [ Officer ] Uh, I don't think so. How old are you? I'm 14. No, you're not. Yes, I am 14. I don't think so. [ Officer ] You're a lot older than that. No, I'm not. How old are you? [ Officer ] How old are you, babe? Eleven. Should you be at school? I'm changing school. We haven't found a new school yet. All right. And where's your parents? I don't live with my parents. Don't you? And who is this lady to you? Friend. She's my friend. It's not very nice bringing a little girl shoplifting, is it? It's not very nice what you're doing. It's not teaching her the right things, is it? It's not very nice you standing over me like that. I'm gonna search your pockets. Are you a police officer? That doesn't matter. No. You're a security guard. Did you try and make the police force? I'm going to phone the police in a minute, so the police force will be here soon. I bet you tried to make it in the police force, but failed miserably. That's why you're working in fucking Boots. I know plenty of-- I know plenty of-- Are you swearing? Yeah. Can you stand up please so I can search you? No, mate. [ Giggling ] I'm searching your pockets anyway. I'm not bothered. Search it. Oh, look. This is nice. Your color. Yeah. Yeah, my color. Yeah.

[ Lauren Screaming ] No! Get off me! No! We'll take you to the floor, Lauren. Calm down. Get off me. Get the fuck off me now, you fucking idiots! Calm down. Calm down. A word of advice is not to hang about with her too much, or you'll be in this police car every day. I find that quite offensive, to be honest with you. Sorry? I find that quite offensive, to be honest with you. Why do you? "You shouldn't be knocking about with her because--" Da-da-dah. To be honest with you, I don't think you've got a clue, P.C. Lawrence. I don't think you really know the ins and the outs. Is that right, Lauren? This is just your job. She's definitely a comedian. She makes me laugh. She makes me laugh. So what have you girls got planned for Christmas then? Gonna get fucking wrecked, mate. That's clever, isn't it? It's gonna be wicked. I can't wait, I can't. So what will the home do for you for Christmas? What do they do? Uh, make a really shit dinner. Right. Hand out a few presents. That's about it. What would you like, P.C. Cooper? You know what I'd really like? I'd like not to see Lauren for at least a week. How about you, Lucy? What do you have planned? I don't know. Don't know? Are you looking forward to it, Lucy? Eh? Sort of. Sort of. Is Santa Claus going to be bringing you any presents? Oh, my God. I don't know. Well-- Santa Claus Is coming to town All right, Lauren, we don't want it to rain. Whoo-hoo-hoo! [ Doorbell Jingling ] What? [ P.C. Lawrence ] Can you let us in? Have you got a warrant? You haven't got a warrant, you ain't coming in my house, mate. We've got a warrant. Cheers. Come along. Show me your warrant. You ain't coming in my house. Let us in. You're not coming in my house without a warrant. Come on, love. Calm down. You're not coming in my house without a warrant. Come on, girls. [ Phone Ringing ] Pricks. Oh, okay. You all right, guys? Comin' straight through. Straight through, Lauren. [ Chattering, Faint ] Just leave us. I'll deal with this one. All right? [ Johann ] Just take a seat over there. Going out? All right. See you later. Just a bit of, um, paperwork, Johann. Just the usual routine, mate. Have a read of that. Sign there. And can you sign this GE71 for me as well, mate? [ P.C. Lawrence ] We don't want to see you two again, okay? - Merry Christmas, girls. - Merry Christmas, guys. Take it easy, mate. Bye. [ Door Closes ] What happened, girls? Why did you get dropped off by the police? Lauren, why did you get dropped off by the police? All right. Lucy, why did you get dropped off by the police? - We went to the shops. - What were you doing at the shops? The police came. Why did the police come? Because... Lauren took some things from the shop without paying for them... and went outside the shop. Lauren, what are you playing at? What are you playing at? Why are you ignoring me for? Why don't you just answer me? Do you know how irresponsible it is, really? You're an idiot, Lauren. I swear to God. [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] It's not funny. It's certainly not funny. Why didn't you say anything? What am I supposed to do, stick up for you? Yeah, that's it. Why didn't you stick up for me? I can't do anything. So he's getting personal about me, calling me a dickhead, saying that I'm an idiot-- He's got a little bit of a point. And you didn't say anything? You brought the police back. You got caught lifting. Yeah? So? It's not exactly Einstein, is it? [ Lauren ] She didn't do anything. She didn't go in the shops and robbed owt. It was me. So I don't know why everyone was telling her not to hang around with me. [ Ben ] Are you a child or an adult? You always say, "Don't treat me like one of them. I'm not one of them kids." [ Lauren ] Yeah. I didn't say anything. I don't understand why you didn't stick up for me. [ Ben ] Are you going to let me speak, or are you just going to carry on speaking over me? I can't be sticking up for you when you bring the police home for shoplifting... and getting her into trouble. How can I do that? That don't make any sense at all, does it? You made your bed, Lauren. You lie in it. End of. [ Footsteps ] All right. See you. [ Door Closes ] [ Doorknob Rattling ] - You all right? - Fuck off. What do you mean, fuck off? Go away. What was I supposed to do, stick up for you? I'm not bothered. I've just been down there. I've had a right old bust-up with Michael. He's not too happy with me, you know. Isn't he? Look, come down and watch a film. I don't want to. Oh, come on, face-ache. No. Come downstairs and watch a film. Go away! I don't want to! Get that on. I'll go and put the kettle on. Give you two minutes. Fuck off then. Shut up. You gonna come? You gonna come down? Go away, Ben. All right. [ Door Closes ] [ Door Closes ] [ Water Running ] [ Doorknob Rattles ] [ Tea Kettle Whistling ] [ TV: Music Box ] Budge up then. Come on, Lucy. Come and sit down. Come watch this. Apparently I'm a geek. We're watching a French film. [ Chuckles ] [ Music Box ] [ TV: Man Speaking French ] [ Music Box ] [ Man Speaking French ] [ TV: Woman Speaking French ] Good night, everyone. I think it's time for bed now. It's all right, Mike. I said they could stay up. It's a bit late. I think everyone should get into bed. - Yeah, but if I said it's okay, it's okay, isn't it? - Well, I think definitely Lucy. Do you want to go to bed? Yes, please. Yeah? Come on then. [ Sighs ] It's not like they're watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Come on, Lucy. Don't undermine me in front of-- I'm not being funny with you, mate, honestly. You don't have to be funny. [ Whispers ] Prick. [ TV: French ] What? He was making me laugh. Oh, evening, Kieran. All right? All right. [ Laughs ] [ Laughing ] Oh-ho! [ Both Laughing ] [ Laughing ] Don't make me-- [ Lauren Giggling ] Shh, shh, shh. Shh! Shh! Shh! [ Whispering ] Please. No laughing. Put that light off. [ Giggling ] Shush!

[ Door Closes ] [ Dog Barking ] [ Birds Twittering ] [ Wind Whistling ] [ Church Bells Tolling ] [ Chattering ] You all right? Yeah. I made you some toast, and there's some milk if you want it. There you go. Thank you. There you go. I was worried about you. Is it all right? Good. Oh. Do you believe in God? Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes it's hard to believe in God, but, yeah, I believe in God. I believe in lots of different gods. Here, that on there. That's an Indian god. Krishna. You learn all about different religions, don't you, at school? I only know about Christianity. Do you? About Jesus? Yeah. Jesus is great. Are you married? No, I'm not married. Do you have a partner or anything? A partner? Yeah, I've got a boyfriend. We can have a look at the different ones for you though. [ Boy Babbling ] Oh. [ Vicky ] So that's it. Does it tickle? [ Chuckles ] [ Vicky ] And relax your foot. And your other foot if you can. Okay. Shows you're at a size one, one and a half. Okay, I'll take this off. So what are we here for today? [ Vicky ] We just want something for going out. So you can choose. You like trainers? I like the sparkly ones. Yeah? [ Man ] Sparkly ones? I can do ones that flash, young lady. - [ Vicky ] Oh, they're really good. - [ Man ] Fabulous. And they're-- And they're good 'cause they haven't got laces as well. But it's up to you. Do you like them? Do a little dance. Wiggle your toes about. They look really cool. If you could have any color hair, what would you have? Out of those wigs? Probably the blonde. You'd stay blonde? I like it 'cause it's got-- The pink goes with the pink in your trainers. Do you want to keep it on? [ Chuckles ] You want to keep it-- Okay, let me cut the labels off. Can I get a receipt? Yeah. [ Humming ] [ Ben Chattering ] [ Door Opens ] [ Ben ] You all right? Oh, yeah. Hiya, Jackie. [ Ben ] Jackie's here, Lucy. Lucy, do you want to pop next door with Jackie and get started? Just take her to 201. You start with your chat, then I'll pop in and take over. Okay. Just give you five minutes. Aren't you gonna show Jackie what you bought? Good. And what about your family, Lucy? Has anyone been in touch? No. You had a dental checkup yet? I don't think so. Okay. Okay, we're gonna try and get you into a Catholic school, if we can find one, uh, close by. Says here that you've been absconding, Lucy. What's that all about? [ Pen Scribbling ] I'm sorry that I've not been here for a while. But the office didn't sort out my petrol money. But now that they have, I'm gonna be here a lot more. Okay? So I need you to call me whenever you need anything. Okay? Good. [ Clears Throat ] Okay, we need to set a date for your review. Do you think I could ask about living with my mummy? It's something we could talk about at the review, isn't it? I'll be there, and maybe Vicky. Here you are. Tea's up. Oh, lovely. Brought you a glass of milk, Lucy, all right? I'll leave you two to have a chat, but if you need me, give me a shout. [ Jackie ] Okay. So, at your review, there'll be me. [ Door Opens ] There'll be your senior social worker, and maybe Vicky as well. [ Door Closes ] So we'll all talk about that. But you've not heard from her at all, no? No. Not a letter or anything? [ Papers Rustling ] [ TV: Indistinct ] You all right? [ Laughs ] Dob. No, you dob. [ Laughs ] Oh. [ Laughs ] Dob! Oh. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] [ Kisses ] Smile. Lauren? It's me, Lucy. [ Exhales Slowly ] [ Lauren Exhales Slowly ] [ Hissing ] [ Inhaling ] [ Inhaling ] [ Exhales Slowly ] [ Chuckles ] [ Inhales ] I'm all right, Lucy. You don't need to worry about me. [ Water Running ] [ Water Stops ] [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] Oi. Oi. Wake up. [ Mumbling ] What was that all about? You know what it was about? What are you doing then? I've come to chat. Oh, can't I speak to you tomorrow, please? No, we need to talk about it now, don't we? Speak to you tomorrow. No. Ben, what are you doing? [ Ben ] Do you still love me? Yeah. [ Ben ] What? Yes. You turn around for me? Come on. I need to see your face. Look at me. You're so beautiful, you know? You don't know how beautiful you are, do you? No. [ Ben ] I do though. [ Rustling ] [ Lauren ] No, Ben. [ Ben ] Come on. [ Lauren ] Ben, no. It's all right. It's okay. Ben, please. You all right? Ben. Hmm? [ Ben Whispering ] What the fuck are you looking at? [ Vicky ] Obviously, Lucy's only been with us a short time, so it's hard to ascertain a full picture. But this is the first time she's been placed in a children's home, and I think that's proving one of the hardest things for her to settle in. There hasn't been much continuity. But she is vulnerable because of her age. And we need to put in some guidelines, some rules. Um, and I think that's one of my main concerns and priorities for Lucy. So, another thing that I think is quite important would be to get her into a school. Because I think she's missing school. Also, perhaps for Lucy to maybe speak to a counselor... or a child psychologist on a weekly basis... if we can push for that budget-wise. Lucy and I have spent a bit of time together, and one thing that's come out of that is... that I've tried to put into place that she is vulnerable because of her age. So going away without telling us, I-I mean, for none of the kids is that appropriate, but with her it is a particular concern. I mean, I know we've gone through that with her, but maybe there needs to be another... meeting that I have with her, or go through some-- maybe state some clearer guidelines for her. [ Jackie ] And is there anything you want to say, Lucy? Anything that you don't understand, that you want us to go through again? Because now's the time for you to say. I don't understand why I can't live with my mummy. Unfortunately, at this moment in time, it's the courts that are going to have to decide. [ Door Closes ] [ Chattering, Screaming ] We went on the ghost train, and there was two of them. Oh, this is really good.

Cheeky chops. Five to 6:00 in the evening. That's when you were born. You were a tiny thing. Your head was right here. And your wee legs would dangle. You know, I wouldn't let anybody hold you. In case they dropped you. So precious. Do you know the first thing I ever said to your mum? I said, "Have we met before?" Really corny. But I meant it. No, we hadn't. But we convinced ourselves that we had and... it was meant to be. She wanted to be a mum, you know. She wanted to be a mummy, but she just-- Just wasn't in her. She loved you, you know. I love you. She loved you. There was just something missing. Life goes by that quickly, Lucy. You think you've got all the time in the world... and then it's over. Your mistakes are there forever. "Midway upon the journey of our life, I found myself within a forest dark, for the straightforward pathway had been lost."

I don't care what his point is. - He's manager of the house. That was out of order. I don't know if I'm going mad or if I'm paranoid or whatever, but I don't know who else to speak to about it. I know. About Ben? Yeah. And Lauren? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't, Darren. What? Have you seen them? I've been feeling it for weeks. Should I talk to somebody? I don't know. Service Standards or something like that? Service Standards? I'll go straight to the fucking police, man. I know it's happening. We just can't prove it. - What to do? Do it now? - No, no. Tomorrow. Michael, can I have five minutes with Darren, please? I'm not going anywhere, mate. Can I just have five minutes with Darren, please? No. No? You want to stay? Mmm. What's up, Ben?

[ Woman Sighs ] There you go. Thank you. Here. What's that for? What do you think it's for? It's for the bus. Where are you going? Is there any chance I can stay? Oh, God! Come on. Let's go. Got your money ready? Yeah. [ Vehicle Approaching ] Go on. Lucy. Lucy! [ Sobbing ] Oh, God. [ Sobbing Continues ] Oh, God. Don't you ever, ever be sorry about coming to see your mummy, okay? [ Sighs ] [ Man ] My soul is weak My eyes are blind The fire that drove me on Is nothing more than dust and ash The day my friend was gone Now he got his name on a rock again This time it's the last And got his thousand friends, I'm sure Party is over fire So put your hand in my hand And maybe we'll forget That life had even started Before the day we met My rotten bones full of holes Skin just holds 'em in Might look like I'm damaged But the damage is deep within So put your hand in my hand And maybe we'll forget That life had even started Before the day we met [ Ends ] [ Birds Twittering ]
