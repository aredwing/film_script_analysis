Everything compared to you is small, meathouse. You guys know this place used to be a morgue? You gotta be fucking kidding me. No, dead serious. Wow. That's one of the reasons why it's so frigging haunted. And the fact that, you know, so many people died here. That helps. Well, um, I've seen enough. I think we should get back before your sister finds out we're gone, Casey. Go back? Yeah. But we have to go in first. Besides, she's busy porking shit-ass Steve. We have plenty of time. But the house is locked, Casey. And I forgot my inhaler. I need it. Breathing's for gays, dude. Besides... I just so happen to have the key. Wait. Is that one of those rocks with the key hidden inside, you know, the hideaway rock? Is it a hideaway rock? No, it's a regular rock. I throw it. We get in. No, that's vandalism, dude. Get Simon to do it. Fuck you, fat boy. Okay, come on, guys. We've walked all this way. We gotta see inside. Then let's come back and take the damn tour. We can get some souvenirs and shit. You know we don't have any money. Okay, man. If you throw that rock in there and you do something and piss off all the ghosts, then what? Mm-hmm. Then we see 'em, and that's exactly what we came here for. Oh, my god. You know what? Uh... You do this, meathouse. Your arms are fatter than mine. It's muscle, cancer tooth, and I'm not going to jail for some stupid-ass ghosts. [laughing] Dumb-ass. [wind blows] Don't look at me. I'm not about to do it. I'd rather be at home watching the rest of the fulci marathon. Fulci is an artistic abortion. Argento is the way to go, man. Shut up, you fat Louie Anderson looking motherfucker. Okay, fine. I'll do it. I guess it's a man's job anyway. Wouldn't want one of you ladies to break a nail. Hey, that was only one time. [glass breaks] Now what? Now... I get a few shots. And then... What? You've got to be fucking kidding me. [horn honks] Aah! Fuck. [crash] [music playing] [camera clicks] Welcome, everyone, to America's Most Haunted House. If you're all ready, we'll get started. Right this way. Here we are in the piano room. When Thomas and Anna Whaley first built the house, they planned to run part of it as a business, which was in this room. It was called Whaley and Crosthwaite's general store. His partner, Philip Crosthwaite, was once the Deputy Sheriff of San Diego, and it just so happens that he was the man who tightened the noose around Yankee Jim Robinson's neck, who was hanged here when the public gallows occupied the grounds... Allegedly. Right this way, everyone. The Whaley house was also the site of the first commercial theater in all of San Diego. The ghost of a little girl has been seen in here on several occasions. Nobody really knows who she is. Some think that she's the great-granddaughter of Thomas Whaley, but it's still a mystery. W-whoa. Did-- Did you see that? Never mind. Anyway, let's continue on, everyone. Now... I have been asked if I've ever seen anything before, and the answer to that is... No. Actually, to be quite honest, I am pretty skeptical of the whole thing. Now, I'm not saying that I don't believe in ghosts [creaking] I just haven't been convinced either way. [creaking] I'm sorry, but I don't know how you don't believe this house isn't haunted. Excuse me? I've been seeing things for the past 20 minutes. Am I alone here? You're kidding. You're kidding. This house is haunted as fuck. Well, what have you seen? Maybe you've just mistaken something. No. No, I haven't mistaken anything. I've been seeing ghosts and... [coughing] Are you okay? Get her some water, please. [gagging] Somebody call 911! I need you to... [dispatch chatter] Whoa. Sorry. Hey, Bobo. You okay, kiddo? Yeah. Yeah, it just... [siren blaring] Kinda stunk. No kidding. But you were great, though. Thanks. It happens all the time. Really? Believe it or not, someone has a reaction to this house, and they have to be wheeled away to the hospital. Why? Well, it's this damn house. It does things to people. You've been here, what, dear, four months? I-I've been working here over 30 years. Trust me. I know how to deal with this house. How to deal with it? Well, walk with me while I close the place up. I don't think we're going to be doing any more tours today. You know, Penny, When I first started working here, my predecessor gave me three rules to live by, and I think-- Think maybe it's time I shared those with you. [keys jingle] [lock turns] So rule number one, don't call the ghosts out. They hate that. Rule number two, don't damage the house. They're very territorial. And rule number three, never, never go inside the house at night. That is their time, reserved for them alone. You know I don't believe in ghosts, right? Heh. I used to be just like you, Penny, used to think it was all a big tourist trap. So what changed your mind? Just because you don't believe in ghosts, doesn't mean they don't believe in you. You know, Penny, dear, you know who you remind me of? No. Who? Did--did you ever wonder why you ended up working here, despite the fact that you don't believe in ghosts? Eh, ghosts had nothing to do with it, okay? I just lucked into it. I needed a job to help pay my way through med school, and this is where I ended up. Hmm. Maybe it was meant to be. What was meant to be? Oh, nothing. Just my-- my mind wandering. Anyway, look, you go on home now, and I'll see you tomorrow morning, okay? [music playing] Right. So that's what I think is the most crucial element. My god. I agree. I mean, have you actually seen the nipples on an indian woman? Are we really talking about this right now? Okay, honey, please, please. The men are trying to talk, so... I think the width and the girth of the areola are just as important as the size of the breast, you know, adds majesty to the bosom. Definitely. A fantastic set of nipples can literally define a woman. Guys, will you please shut up? I think it goes back to when we were babies. Okay, I think I know where we're going with this, so let's just, uh, stop talking about it. Baby, I'm a scientist. Please. See, the thing is-- is we want to marry our mothers. What?! And we seek out nipples that are similar to the ones that we suckled. Ah, lord. Penny's nips, just like my mother's. What?! Shut up! Ouch. Ouch. You need me to do that to you? No, I'm--I'm good. Okay. There you go. Guys, can we change the subject now? Yes. Let's. How was everyone's day? Some tourist freaked out at the house today. No shit? Yeah. It was weird. Freaked out how? Started going into seizures and foaming at the mouth. You're joking. No. And apparently it happens all the time. My boss blames it on the house, like it's poison or something. I don't know how you can work at that place. It's not that bad. Not that bad? It's haunted as fuck. Well, if I ever see anything, I'll let you know, Craig. Yeah, but ghost shit, it can't be real. It just doesn't make sense. Well, just 'cause we don't understand it, I mean, it doesn't mean it isn't real. Right. I mean, it took 'em a hell of a long time to figure out gravity, right? Actually, I don't think that's the case. Okay, I mean, millions of people have experienced the paranormal, okay? Yet one witness is enough to send someone to death row. I'd rather be talking about nipples. Look, ghosts are real, and the Whaley house is really haunted. Why? Because TV says so? Are you saying the TV lies to me? Oh, no, no, no, honey balls. TV is your master. Right. All I'm saying is that weird stuff happens there, but I just can't buy that ghosts are real. It doesn't make sense. Penny, you work in the mornings, right? Sometimes. Wait. Wait. Craig, what are you thinking? So you open the doors, and you lock up at night? Sometimes. Okay, now I don't want to make an ass out of you and me, but is it safe to assume that you have a set of keys to the Whaley house or at least access to them? Yeah, but... wait a minute. Oh, my god. Craig. Oh, that's such a great idea. No. No, it's not. A private tour of the most haunted house in america. What do you say, Penny? Eh, wait. Wait, what-- No! Guys, I can get fired! Mmm, please. Come on, sweetie. What do you say? We'll be on our best behavior. Just--just a couple of hours, pen. I can call my cousin and borrow some stuff. He's like Q branch for ghost hunters. But, guys, if anything breaks, I'm liable, and I need this job. Oh, my god. No one is going to find out. We'll be careful. We're not doing this, right? God, first you drive us to the set of thriller, and then you want to take us to a haunted mansion? What's wrong with you? Ahem! Hey, Penny... You know, it's, um-- it's your call. Pretty please? Okay! Yes! But only for a little bit, all right? Yes! This is just to prove to you guys that there's nothing there. [line rings] Just in and out. What's going to hap-- Yeah, we'll just do the old in-and-out. Hey. Hey, Ray-Ray. Guess what we're doing tonight. [gasps] Oh, wow. Oh, my god, you guys. It smells so cool in here. This place is creepy as fuck. It's just an old house. They say you could hear the footsteps of Thomas Whaley pacing up in his bedroom. Why are we whispering? [knock on door] Ohh. Are you Craig's... cousin, twice removed. Hey! Black-ass Ray! White-ass Craig! [both laugh] This is dope as shit, brother. Yeah. How did you pull this off? Penny. She works here, man. Well, I hope you don't mind, but I kind of brought a friend. Who? [gasps] Keith Drummand. At your service, young friends. [gasps] the famous Keith Drummand? The one and only, young man. The one and only. Heh heh. World-famous, if you don't mind. Give me your hand. You're an Aries. Taurus, actually. Oh. Really? Well... someone here is an Aries. Ah! There. You see? Heh heh. Now, enough chitchat. Let me at those darn ghosts. [chuckles] Who's Keith Drummand? I thought it was just gonna be us. Heh. Are you serious? He's a psychic. He's been on, like, every ghost-hunting show on TV, even that short-lived crippled kid's one. Let's go. It's all right. [exhales] I'm here. I heard you. You called me back. What do you want from me? Yes. Yes. All right. All right. I--I-- You want this, and I can give it to you. It'll help. Ah! Be careful with the floor, please. As a matter of fact, be careful with everything, guys. Sorry. You know what? Here are some ground rules, okay? No touching anything. No taking anything. No rifling through papers or breathing on anything, guys. Come on. Everything is really fragile. Pen, pen, relax. It's gonna be fine. Hey, what'd you bring me? The works, baby. Ooh. First and foremost, digital voice recorder. Oh, evp. Nice. What's evp? It's a fancy term for recording ghost voices on tape. See, the recorder picks up frequencies the human ear can't detect, so if they're talking, we'll hear 'em. Yeah, but does that really work? Google it. You'll hear things that'll turn your asshole white. Ha ha! Laser thermometer. You can measure temperatures all over, or you can spot-temp with the laser. Good for pointing out cold spots. And the pice de rsistance... The emf meter. Motherfucker. Emf? Electricians use 'em, but ghost hunters do, too. It's a commonly held belief that ghosts disrupt the electromagnetic field, so you can use these things like metal detectors. But for ghosts. Right as rain. You didn't bring the full-spectrum camera? Dumb-ass Dave dropped it on a tombstone a few nights ago. [sighs] That sucks. It's okay. Shit-ass Steve is gonna fix it. So what do we do now? Just walk around, or... We could, but I'd like to try an oldie, but goodie first. What's that for? Ah, there we are. Heh heh. [girl laughs] Hello? Who's there? [clock ticking] Guys, we really shouldn't be doing this. Will you please relax, Giselle? No. I'm not doing this. I'm not a part of this. Okay, everyone. One finger lightly on top. We are speaking to the Whaley family or any earthbound entity in this house. We would like to communicate with you. My finger's starting to cramp up a little already. Yeah, I've heard that before. Hey, it's called rheumatoid arthritis, all right? Guys, we need to focus. No. We need to get the fuck out of here. Penny, you work here. Maybe you should ask the question. What should I ask? I don't know. Maybe something only the ghost would know. Yes or no questions. Um... Okay. Did Violet Whaley die in this house? Move the glass if yes, spirit. [gasping] [laughs] That was Craig. I swear to god it wasn't me. No, that was you, Craig. I know it was. No. I know you think I'm lying 'cause I'm an asshole, but I swear to god I didn't move that. Ray: All right, guys, fingers back on. We've got someone here. You're on, Penny. Okay, Violet died in this house, but did she shoot herself here, too? Move in a circle if no and a straight line if yes, spirit. Did she shoot herself in the head? No. That's right. She shot herself in the heart. That's so sad. Why? Um, her husband abandoned her after two weeks of marriage, so she went outside and shot herself. Thomas Whaley heard the gunshot, and he went out and brought his daughter in the house. She died in that chair. Of course she did. Okay, guys, I am getting increasingly freaked the fuck out here. We've got someone hanging on here. Can we please focus? Is this Violet Whaley? Are you still there, spirit? Are you a ghost? Are you a moron? I'm a little nervous right now. Are you still here? Oh. Wow. It likes you. Ask it something else. Um... Are you a Whaley? Okay. But which one? All of them. This place... This house... is interesting. How so? You know when you walk into a darkened movie theater and it seems empty because it-- You can hardly see anything? But there are other people there watching you, sitting in the dark. That's how it feels. I just need to get adjusted to the dark. You want to look around? Yes. Yes. I think we should. Is it okay? Fine. "Fine"? Really? 'Cause this is kind of crazy right now, Penny. guys, okay? I been looking forward to this. The Whaley house has barred its doors to paranormal investigators for years. So tonight I'll be the first one to peek behind its veil. [chuckles] Quite a feather in my cap, don't you think? [laughs] You can wait here alone if you want. Well, shit, when you put it like that... [woman sighs] Yeah. Well, I feel like we're on the set of thriller. No, we're not. We're at my job. I thought we were going out. I had my hair done. Of course we're going out, but I got to take care of something first. This place looks haunted. Just a minute. Puffy. Puffy. Who's Puffy? Come here, baby. Come here, Puffy. Is it a monster or something? Puffy, look what papa got. Look. Puffy? Hot chick. Big tits. Can we go have sushi at a nice restaurant now? Yeah, in a minute. Really? Baby? Puff? [sighs] all right, I'm just gonna go before I get murdered. Babe, hold on. Babe. Hey, babes, where'd you go? Babe. Come on, now. We-- we getting ready to go. You just wait a second. [woman crying softly] Hello? Who's there? [crying continues] who's out there? Bobo: I can't see you. Are you hurt? Oh, fuck that shit! [groaning] [lapping] [meows] Ray: This is the Whaley house. Time is 10:30. We are proceeding to the second floor. When you see a ghost, what does it look like? I'm just curious. I see them like I see you. Sometimes they're wispy and filmy, just like in the movies, but usually they're solid. Just another state of being. You get me? Kind of. Kind of like how water turns to steam, you know. [hinge creaks] Ah, there we are. Hello? Who's there? This is so cool. Convinced yet? About what? Oh, come on. That glass thing down there was crazy. Okay-- No, no, no. Stop. You cannot tell me that it was, like, some sort of... That was Ray. Trick. That was Ray, okay? It had to be. No way. I mean, how would he know all that stuff about Violet Whaley? Look, I was on the spot, okay? I couldn't think of any obscure info on the house, and Violet was on my mind, so I asked about her. But the thing is you can find all that stuff out online or by taking my tour. Look, it wasn't a ghost, okay? It was probably just Ray. God, I love you. Okay, Scully. [creak] whatever you say. What do you see? Nothing. It's probably just the wind. This is the heart of the house. The vortex? You see? [beep] It's 10 degrees cooler where you're standing. What? No way. That's not normal. Right? Sometimes a ghost's presence or a vortex can create cold spots. Wait. What's a, uh... A vortex? For lack of a better word, it's a doorway in and out of this reality, usually found at the heart of haunted locations there's someone here. Tom? Thomas? Oh, shit. Is that your name? [laughs] Keith: Tom? Thomas? Talk to me. Speak to me, please. Why are you looking at us like that? Because... He's standing right behind you. Ohh. [laughter] That's not funny, all right? I wasn't joking. [clicking] Does that mean that there's something there? That means there's something there. We'd like to speak with you, sir. [slam] Yes. Yes. Bang the wall again for me, Thomas. [slam] Yes. Yes. Once for no, and twice for yes. Okay? [slam slam] [creak] Are you bound to this house? [slam] [laughing] Oh, my god. That was-- That was a no? He's free-roaming? Are there others with you, Thomas? [slam slam] Are you here with your family? [slam slam] [nervous laugh] This can't be happening. Thomas, if you're not bound to the house, can you tell us why you're here? Can you whisper it into my ear? Hey, did-- did Thomas Whaley die in here? No. He died at his second house in San Diego. His wife Anna and some other relatives did die here, though. That's why he's here. That's why he returns, why he protects his house. His loved ones are trapped here... bound to this world. He's here to look over them. And they don't like us being here. Okay, I'm done. Let me go. Mm, Giselle, please. No, Craig. Go fuck yourself. This guy doesn't like us being here, so I'm going. [sighs] Just stop being such a baby. Keith is here. You'll be fucking fine. Oh, why is that? Is he, like, ghost bulletproof or something? [muttering mockingly] On the contrary, my child. They've come after me first. They can attack me spiritually, and they know it. Oh. Great. Oh, hell, no! What the fuck, Ray?! You all need to hear this shit. [soft static] [slam on recording] [laughing] Oh, my god. That was-- That was a no? [raspy] Will... Di-i-ie. That's a Class-A evp if I ever heard one. [laughs] Fuck me. How is that possible? Woman: Oh, crap. What's wrong with seal? Keith, are-- Are you channeling? I'm fine. I'm fine. There's someone else here. I-It's not Thomas. It's the missis of the house. What was that? Anna says hi. Come sit with me, Anna. [floor creaking] You don't mind I'm sitting on your bed, do you? That's right. Come over here. [creaking continues] Come. I won't hurt you. Let's be friends. She's there? She's here. Ah. Ah. Oh, I see. Her? Me? What about me? Oh, god. No, what about me? She's gone. You were pointing at me. Why? She recognizes you. Heh. She recognized me. Maybe 'cause you work here? Yeah. Oh, that's-- That's gotta be it. Hold up. Listen. Keith: Ah. Ah. Oh, I see. Her? Me? What about me? [woman wails] You all hear that shit? Yeah. I think everybody heard that shit. Dude, this could get us, like, a show on syfy channel or something. We should be filming this. [laughs] I think I just shit myself a little bit. Okay, that's it. I'm leaving. [rattles] Giselle, ghosts can't hurt you. Actually, they--they can. There was this case in 1987-- you know what? I think Giselle's right. We've overstayed our welcome. They're just trying to get our attention. [rattling] This is a terrible way to spend a Saturday night. Looking for ghosts? Walking around an old house in the dark? What the fuck is that all about? It's stupid. If ghosts were real, it wouldn't matter when you looked for them. Ray: Well, the theory is-- fuck the theory. They can have this shitty-ass house to themselves. They don't have to go around slamming doors in my face or trying to scare the shit out of me. Gigi, calm down. I'm calm, Vanessa. I am super calm. I just want to get the fuck out of this house. Where are the stairs? They're down that way. What? Don't look at me. She's your friend. Oh, come on. Yeah, you'll be thanking us when we're making bank off our ghost-hunting show. Retarded, the whole thing. [creaks] Um, hello? [screams] [crack] Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Giselle. [gasping] Giselle! Giselle. Get down here! Oh, shit. Giselle. Giselle. Giselle. No, no, no, no. Penny: no, no. She must have tripped down the stairs. No. How's that happen? Giselle. Is she okay? Giselle, honey. Craig: Penny, is she... Penny: Hey. Giselle. No. No way, man. She-- she can't be. Well, does she have a pulse? Giselle, honey. Giselle, honey. Giselle, wake up. This isn't good. Yeah, no shit. No, I mean for the house. This isn't good for the house. No way, man. We need to-- We need to call for help, right? Right? Penny, let me see your phone. Penny. This isn't fucking happening right now. Just shut up, Craig. Listen, both of you, shut up. What are you doing? What the fuck does it look like I'm doing? What are you talking about? Who are you gonna call? I'm gonna call 911. No. No, you can't do that. Am I cra-- Get the fuck off me. Are you fucking crazy? Don't be an idiot, man. Give me that fucking-- What the fuck-- Give me the phone! Fuck off, Craig. This is fucking serious, man! Craig, man, what are you doing? Don't you guys fucking get it?! It'll look like we killed her. Are you crazy? Apparently I'm the only one processing the situation correctly here. You're such a fucking asshole. I'm an asshole? Yeah, you. We broke into a house... and our friend fell down the stairs, right? Who is gonna buy that shit? If we don't call, they'll think we did it. No. No. No. Listen, uh... we get out of here. We make it look like she snuck in by herself and fell down the stairs while walking around in the dark. That way, none of us get any shit for this. I am doing this for all of you. Now we need to get our stories straight. Otherwise, they're gonna pin this shit on us. What in the name of god are you talking about? It was an accident! An accident? You think they're gonna believe that? Innocent people go to jail all the time! Our friend is dead, and you want to argue about whether or not we should call for help! I'm just trying to be realistic, Pen, okay? This looks really bad, and we're not even supposed to be here. No, this was your idea! Well, you didn't have to let us in! You could have just said no! You're just as responsible for this as-- [dials] [line rings] of your emergency. Yes, hello. My name is Penny Abbott, And I'm at the Whaley house. Did you say, "The Whaley House"? Yes, there's been an accident. My friend, she fell down a flight of stairs and-- I'm sorry. I can't hear you too well, ma'am. Did you say an accident? Yes. My friend, she fell. She fell down a flight of stairs. Ma'am, are you still there? Yes, I'm still here! Hello?! Ma'am, are you there? I'm gonna send--[static] hello! I'm here! Can you hear me? Ma'am, we'll send some-- My friend... oh, come on! What happened? My battery died. That happens. Sometimes a spirit will drain battery power from cameras, meters, even flashlights. They feed off it. Will you cut the crap with that ghost shit?! Well, did you at least get through? I don't know. Well, did you, or didn't you? What do you mean? I don't know, okay? I spoke with someone, but I don't know if they could hear me. I--I don't know. What... probably better that way. Now you shut the fuck up, man! Just trying to help. Fucking idiot. Both of you just stop, okay? I'm gonna get... Ahh! It's hot. I'm afraid... they won't let us go. What? I never felt it like this before. It's like hate. Energy coursing through this house, it's omnipotent. Your poor friend's death, that strengthened them. Strengthened them how? I hear voices. I hear a lot of them. They're saying... Blood has been spilled. When we die, we open the doorway to the next world for our soul. Like the vortex? No. The vortex is always open and weaker, but a fresh death tears the next world open. Wait. What are you saying, man? Your friend's death... No, wait. Not just your friend. There has been-- There has been more blood spilled on the property. More blood? What--what about that woman Who spazzed out earlier this afternoon? She--she's not dead. She was alive when they took her to the hospital. I see a woman and two men right there. Oh, shit! [clicking] Their deaths has opened the portal wide, wider than ever... And they're keeping it open, drawing strength from both sides. No. He is. I hear you. I hear you, Mr. Whaley. He can finally bring his family over to the other side. The portal has allowed them a way out, but he's propping it open for some reason. I'm afraid they aim to do us harm. Why? What did we ever do to them? It's because of her. No, not this again. Yeah, enough of this. Let's smash a window. Shh. Stand still. [clock ticking] Do you all feel that? What? [house rumbling] Ahh! Oh, no. [crying] What the fuck was that all about? It's okay. Just an earthquake? Not an earthquake. That was the portal, my young friends. It was trying to close, but it can't, so it's affecting our reality. Shit! They broke my equipment! You okay, man? No, I am not okay! Do you know how expensive this shit is?! You just can't run down to walmart and buy a-- A trifield meter. Damn it! Now some stupid-ass ghost Has to come and break my shit? Cuz, it's okay. No, it's not okay. Fuck you, ghost! Do you hear me?! Ray. Who the hell do you think you are, breaking a man's shit? Do you know how hard I work for this-- I work a minimum-wage job to afford this shit, and you just gonna come and break it? Fuck you! Ray, be careful. They're listening. Good! I hope they hear me! Damn ghosts can suck my dick. Come on, ghosts! Where are you?! Come on, now. Bang on a wall now, motherfucker. Ray, stop it. Don't call them out. You'll make them angry. Good! Where are you?! Where are you? 10 years, I been looking for you. Heh. Maybe a noise here. Maybe a whisper there, but that's all crap. Ray. If you're there, I want to fucking see you. Don't do that. Here I am. Come and get me, motherfuckers! [Ray panting] [gasps] [gags] Can't breathe. [rope stretching] Shit. [gasps] [sobs] [dog barks] Penny: Okay, okay, okay. [Vanessa crying] Shh. Shh. Okay. This isn't right. None of this, this isn't right. This is--Penny, I want to go home. We're-- I want to go home. We're gonna get out of here, okay? No. No, I know we're not. Don't lie to me. Vanessa, we're gonna be okay, all right? You gotta stay strong. Gotta stay strong, okay? [footsteps upstairs] Shh. Shh. [slam] Okay. It's okay. [slam slam] [footsteps continue] He's up there. They all are. [slam] [slam] Anything? What? No. No, the doors are locked solid. Yeah, it's like a meat locker back there. [slam slam] Are you seriously going back up there? [slam slam] Well, yes. We have to talk to them, ask for their forgiveness. Maybe they'll let us out if we plead for mercy. Plea for mercy? What about all that "power of christ compels you" stuff? Shouldn't we able to force them to let us go? They're not like that. They aren't evil. [laughs] They aren't? They aren't evil? Ray is dead, okay?! Giselle is dead. I know. No, they're just desperate. Desperate for what? You. But I'm not sure why. It's okay. You guys can stay here if you want. I'm going up to find out. It's cold up here, too. Whaley family, we come as friends. Where can we speak? [screaming] No! No! No! Penny: Vanessa! Vanessa! [screams] Oh, god. [sobbing] Vanessa, are you hurt? What happened? She grabbed me! She grabbed me! What? But there's-- There's nobody in here. Guys, look. Look. Vanessa: Oh, god. [sobbing] [footsteps] Oh, god. What is it? I see something. Where? Thomas? It's not Thomas. Keith, what is it? Back up! Back up now! Go back! Go away! Go back! [Vanessa sobbing] [Penny murmuring, shushing] Please, it's okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. What was it? What the hell did you see, man? It wasn't-- It wasn't human. [scoffs] Not human? [sobbing] Like what? Like a fucking demon or something? Okay, stay with me, okay? Okay, I thought you said they were just ghosts. [Vanessa crying] It wasn't a Whaley. Stay with me, okay? I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. It said its name was Santiago. Yankee Jim? Who's Yankee Jim? He was hanged on the property when it was a gallows. He was too tall for the noose, so he stood on his tiptoes when they dropped him. Penny: Shh. It took him hours to die. His real name was Santiago, and he's supposed to be one of the resident ghosts. So, what? So he's not human anymore? W-what the fuck? He told me he died bad. He stayed bad. [screaming] Stop! Stay out! Stay back! You have no power over us! Go away! Go away! He's gonna break the fucking door down! See? I fucking told you! [Vanessa sobbing] Oh, my god. [sobbing continues] Santiago, is that you? Oh, my god. [sobbing ends] He's gone. Well, he was sure as shit there a fucking minute ago. I figure it's exhausted itself with the door and needs to rest. Why is he an it? If he was-- If he was human once, why is he an it? He died bad... on the wrong side. What is that stuff? Purified and blessed sea salt with powdered angelica root. Helps to protect against negative energy. Oh, is that gonna keep them outside? It should work. [rumbling] Ah, shit! [crickets chirping] [thunder rumbling] You ever been in this place before? No. They say it's haunted. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You get a bunch of prank calls about this place? None. This might be the first one. [rings doorbell] [thunder crashes] Anything? Place looks like it's been ransacked. Any ghosts? Let's go around back. Look. Probable cause. Go. SDPD! SDPD! Who's here?! Bodies. Pretty sure they wouldn't have a pulse if I checked anyway. You want to call it in? I got it. We are so fucked right now. I--I mean, like-- Shh, shh, shh. I mean, like fucked--- Shut up! Shut up. Listen. Like really fucked. Listen! Listen! Just... Officer: This is the San Diego police department! Is anybody sick or injured in the house? Dispatch, this is Officer Downs. Come back. Dispatch, do you copy? What, is it wonky? Signal's doing something. Try yours. Hey! Hey! Put the gun down. Put the gun down. Put your hands up! I was the one that called you guys, okay? All right, come down here. Keep your hands where we can see 'em. There are more of us. One of us is hurt. [woman sobbing] I got it. Okay, you go. I got them. Where is he going? [crying] Ma'am. Ma'am, San Diego police. Are you all right? [crying] Ma'am, are you hurt? Officer: Okay, hold it, you two. Where's your friends? Go, go, go, go, go. Gates! Gates: Oh, my god. Gates, what is it? [gasping] [gurgling] What's he doing? Hey, cool it with that stuff, man. Shit. You think chairs are gonna keep those fuckers out, man? This is magic, dude. This'll work. Gates: This is ridiculous. What the fuck? Dispatch, come back. Over. Dispatch. Still not working? No, it isn't. Backup'll be here soon, though, right? I mean, you guys can't just fall off the map, huh? Yeah, if we don't check in within half an hour, they send another squad car out. I hope it's not too long. Vanessa isn't doing very well. Yeah, but-- But she'll be okay, right? No. No, she's not. [creaks] I know you're there. I know you are. Who's there? Come on out. Wait. You think we should leave the room? I wouldn't do that. I'll be right back. She looks like Lisa. Hey, this salt stuff'll protect us in here, right? Yes, unless there's something in here already. [giggles] I know you're here. What's your name, child? What's your name, sweetheart? [giggling] Wait, sweetheart. What about Keith? Man, fuck Keith, okay? He can take it down when he gets back. Just--Here. Help me, please. [humming, murmuring] Hey, I think there might be something wrong with your friend. Hey, baby, are you okay? [continues humming] Vanessa. What is she saying? Baby. Fuck me! Shit! Holy shit! Fucking freeze! This is my house. My house. Will die. Vanessa. You-- Vanessa, what's-- Vanessa-- Vanessa is asleep. You're not Vanessa. You belong to us. Why are you doing this? We want you back.

Who are you? [gasping] No! Look out! What is she-- Penny: No. Watch out! Vanessa! Honey, it's okay. [sobs] It's okay. It's okay. What-- What happened? You know, I don't-- No. Now they're fucking possessing us. [gasping] I have had it with this shit, man! Hey, stay calm. I'm getting the fuck out of here! I'm not gonna wait for these fucks to kill us all! Craig, wait. I'm gonna break this fucking window! Craig! No! [screams] Craig! [sobs] What? [crickets chirping] [clock ticking] [soft whispering] Where'd you go, child? I know you're up here. [whispering continues] Don't be afraid. You know, I had a daughter once. [chuckles] She was so beautiful, had a smile that would make my day. [whispering] Her name was Lisa. [whispering] She's gone now, too. She was hit by a car... [whispering] her and her mommy, a long time ago. [breathes deeply] [whispering] I miss my little girl very much. I remember the hugs the best. May I give you a hug? [screams] I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry. Where'd you go, sweetheart? Where are you, sweetheart? What is this? Not supposed to be there. [gurgles] [screams echoing] [crying] Vanessa: Why would they do that to Craig? Penny: Jesus, Vanessa! Shh, shh, shh. Vanessa, just-- Just stop it, okay? Sweetie, please. Please. Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa. Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa, Put the gun down. You don't need that. Of course I do. It's because of you that we're all here. You deserve to die more than Craig did. [laughs] She's fucking lost it. She's fucking lost it. They aren't gonna let us leave. Can't you see that? I mean, they win. [laughs] They win, right? I mean, they win, right? [laughing] They win. Vanessa, Vanessa, don't. Don't, babe. Vanessa, what are you doing? Just--Just stop it, okay? She won't let me. [whispering] You have to. Do it. Stay with us. [laughs] Ah, she wants it to be like Violet. Penny: Vanessa, put the fucking gun down! Violet died of a broken heart. Me, too. [murmurs] No! Vanessa, no! No. Get her. [sobs] Vanessa. Vanessa. It's okay. It's okay. It's not so bad. They think... You're Violet. [sobbing] Penny. Penny. Penny. I'm done. I give up. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, don't-- Don't you say that. Don't you say that, okay? We can get out of this. No. We can't.

The fire-- There's a fire-- A hatch in the attic. There's a fire escape, a way out of here. Okay. Okay. Okay, Penny, let's go. Where is it? It's back around here. It's padlocked, but maybe we can rip it from the wall. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. What? It must have been Keith's. Penny: Then he's up here? [screams] [yelling] Oh, my god! Pull me! Pull me! Pull me!

I'm afraid so, ma'am. Are you okay to drive, or would you like a ride? I can drive. Ju-just give me a moment to close up the house. [wheels rolling] Is--is that her? Oh, Penny, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. Good-bye, Penny, dear. Oh, Bethany, thank god. Damn this house. She wasn't yours to take. They didn't take me, Bethany. I'm right here. But they didn't take me. They're all gone now. I'm right here. They're all gone now. I'm--I'm here. You did look so much like her. Why can't you hear me, Bethany? You just had to have her. Why can't you hear me? I'm here, Bethany. I'm right here!

Bethany, I'm alive! I'm alive! [sobbing] I'm alive! [music playing] looking in the mirror  no reflection  searching for a pulse  no detection  trying to find a sign  that I exist at all  memory of you  a flash of lightning  [thunder] a dark and empty house can feel so frightening  the sound of my own voice  just echoes off the walls  till I've given up the ghost  given up the ghost  given up the ghost  in this haunted, haunted home  spiders in my sleep  afraid of dreaming  my mind is off the hook  the phone is screaming  I'm reaching out for you  when someone cuts the line  shadows on the move  a faded photo  a footstep in the hall  a shattered window  the wind comes crashing in  to take me back in time  until I've given up the ghost  given up the ghost  given up the ghost  in this haunted, haunted home  another stormy night  another supernatural feeling  another stormy night, and I'm scared  and I'm scared of the dark  scared of the dark  another stormy night  another supernatural feeling  another stormy night, and I'm scared  and I'm scared of the dark  scared of the dark without you  till I've given up the ghost  given up the ghost  given up the ghost  in this haunted, haunted home  another stormy night  another supernatural feeling  another stormy night, and I'm scared  and I'm scared of the dark  scared of the dark  another stormy night  another supernatural feeling  another stormy night, and I'm scared  and I'm scared of the dark  scared of the dark  another stormy night  another supernatural feeling  another stormy night, and I'm scared  and I'm scared of the dark  scared of the dark  another stormy night  another supernatural feeling...
