Should I call security? One, two, three ... Action! What life has in store for me, I will never forget the words of my uncle: "With great power comes great responsibility." This is a gift from God, as we know. But it's also a curse. I did not understand a single word. Although I am Asian, but not as a! If there is a performance full of emotion and truth, lets them language superfluous. No, I understood the deeper meaning, because the words have penetrated into my heart.

Tell merely no baloney! You feel the same? Sometimes, because making love blindly. - Is he in the film? Not everyone in Hollywood is in the movie business. I always thought he was the right thing. One day he said to me, he would tell me something very important. I immediately thought of a request. So I made my hair, the nails, and I bought an expensive dress. I thought it would be for it appropriately. But then ... - Then he made the request? Yes, but a others. Well, since it was clear that he is only one of the dishonest types. And the worst thing is, he never told me all these years, the truth. I'm sorry for you. - Oh, you know, past is past. Today I feel good. Only I feel towards my parents guilty. They told me he would be unreliable I then go under any circumstances to America. They were crying and begging. Unfortunately, I have enforced my head. I wanted to go to America to lead a good life. I was ashamed to return home. Well, and then I found this job as a tour guide. I did not know that this was only a cover for a smuggler group. But you should still be able to leave when it's you noticed. Manny is' n very crafty guy. He knows America well. And if the cops catch him, he will blame it all on me. ... Then we hold it in place. So, we have checked your story. You may go. Thank you very much. Thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen. Speaking of hospitality, please be my guest at the Five-Star Motel.

If this is a film that takes me the snake bite in the butt. And Xiaoming would poison suck me out of my butt, to save me, right? Your film is shit! "During the filming of an animal was injured." We cut out. leave seems to be genuine. Hello? Hello? - Is anyone here? Here's some living soul? Away from here! I can not believe it! Are you Robocop? You shoot so incredibly good. Where did you learn that? - From movies. I think that's your gun. - Tell's anyone. All right. - Cut! Cut! Were we in grade 'nem film it? - Cut! Cut! Cut! What was that? What was that! The car should not roll over! The car should go directly into the building, after which it explodes! Have you changed? - No, sir. Someone that has changed. Who has changed? Who dares behind my back to simply change any things, huh? You, you with the beard! Have you changed? Can any of you change anything here? so are movies shot? "Wronald will never know of our affair. He is like an idiot standing there." "But what makes that when we have so much fun around a bitch?" Fuck you, damn you, Gary Buesheimer! Huh! Fuck you, Gary Buesheimer! Who should be fucked? - Gary Buesheimer. He slept with the wife of the director. - Great! The hardcore version. Divorce is hard. But making movies is harder. So when I say that the building will explode over there, then this means that the building will explode! Uh, the building is just explode? Who the hell are you huh? Do you know what you hired her? You just ruined my four-million-dollar action scene. Your she gets from the pasture, bring them behind the barn and shoot them! Xiaoming -? Yan Yan? Yan Yan do not tell me you had something to do with this guy. I wish I could say that. I am so sorry. Ow, ow, except. Again in the back. Always I get stitches in the back. Yes, in the back! Full purely in the back. Who has the thing parked here, huh? Who parked that in my scene? That was you, sir. - Then propelled's gone! The explosion is gone off prematurely. Is anyone hurt? I bare. Pretty hard even. - Oh, you poor thing! Do you need help? Yes! Today I hurt myself to see if I can still feel. You are so cute. Well, come in my trailer. Maybe I can help you to feel something else. Why are you building again such crap? I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, really sorry. Only because of you I came. I do not want that we separate. Perhaps there is a way. Xiaoming, I know what you feel for me. Honestly. But do not get me. I have found here what I wanted. Something I love. You're right. I am on your side. I want to be with you. Xiaoming! - I'll do anything for you. Yan Yan -! Es ist vorbei, Xiaoming. Yan Yan! Please, go now. Yan Yan? Can you imagine what he went through to ... Who are you? Do you have something to do with it? - He has flown halfway around the world, lost, just to see you almost his life. Do you know how hard it is, how to find him such a decent man? Sure, sometimes it's boring, stiff and a bit old fashioned, and certainly he tries to impose his will. But he is a man who is true to his word. And he would sacrifice everything he has, for your love. For you he would give his life. So a man I'd never let go. Give him one more chance. Xiaoming, wait! Do not run away! I have enough. I have enough. What I thought me to fly here? You followed your heart. Now you have to face the truth. Which is? The thing is clear, right? Incidentally, I thank you that you helped me to find Yan Yan. Honestly, thank you very much. Second! I forgot to film this important moment. I am not in the mood. Dawei, I warn you. This is exactly the right time. The hero must be only at the low point, thereby exploded his energy to save the world. I'm telling you for the last time. This is not a fucking movie! And I'm not a hero! I'm just a big idiot in the desert. Marvelous! Can you the word "idiot" more stress and the phrase saying again? Okay, me that's enough. Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen, the end has come! Cursed! Did you lose something? You know what I love about a good apple pie? He must not be too sweet. There are things that are so sweet, because you get animal abdominal pain. Others are not sweet enough. An apple pie has to be in the middle. Between. And it belongs to the diet. And we want to be reasonable indeed. Is this the happy hour back, or here a horror film is rotated? Oh, I almost forgot. Here's your mobile phone, Bro. Do not worry, my partner take care of in a secret location to them. Oops! Here. Take them and let them free. - I beg you! What do I look for?

Simultaneously, the ribs are done. turn once more and put it on the plate. And then there's enjoy! Yes / Yes! We can start now! Holt times your dish, girls. Hey, Gary. Two friends looking for you. Gary Buesheimer, that's the guy from the movies. Hey. We have your Rhino here! - I'd not so rumposaunen. Rhino! In here! In the bag 's whole Rhino should be hidden? Uh, yeah! In here! - Release me! Did you as also happens to be 'ne giraffe in it? I know a Greenpeace fundraiser when he stands before me. The work of a true environmentalist never ends. Come into the house. I present you a check. I know people. This is pure luxury. The do not care. You know, while a golden cage may be golden, but he is a cage. In the spotlight you have to be the good guy, working hard and tidy donate money. But the best thing about Hollywood is, it is the only place in the world, where you can be someone else. Everything here is fake. You just have to believe it. And if you believe it, it also believes the audience. If you have a little imagination, anything is possible. Checkmate. Of course we are all ordinary people in the end. And everyone has their little quirks. Tomorrow, for example, is my annual Pink Party. And I've done all the planning. You see, and for what? The public thinks this is a fundraiser for vulnerable Dodos or so 'n shit. But actually it is, we dance with the devil. And again everything is an illusion, but a necessary, addictive. If someone comes to my house and cries on my lawn in front of all the guests some nonsense about a rhinoceros horn, then the smoke and the levels begin to buckle, and people begin to recognize you, the real you. And all the work that has been invested to create this illusion, go down at once the goddamned drain. Why could you not your mouth shut? Okay, okay. Here it is. Let them go and take me. OK? What? You want to play like heroes in movies? In reality, this is not working. Run! Fast! Where are you going, baby? The Fiesta begins but just beginning. That's it. That's it. Only four days ago I was happy and felt comfortable and satisfied. I thought I had the perfect plan for a full life. But I had not thought that, if I hang with his head down, the world is upside down and suddenly you do not know which way is up and down. Are you okay, Troublemaker? I'm so sorry. If I had listened to you, we'd gone earlier, and would not be here ... Do not talk nonsense. This is all my fault. Definitely not. Nevertheless, I think we are a good team. I find even ... - time, take out the garbage. Dawei, how did you ... - Shh! Is Dawei there? - Does it might help? And. You do not know when it's over, right? - What's going on, Xiaoming? Hey, I've beaten Rick Fox of the Lakers ko. I beat Rick Fox of the Lakers ko. Why did not you used earlier? Because I ask all the time if you need help. And you say no. Now we're pretty fucked up. The Rhino Horn is gone and the coal we did not get. But there must be some solution. What comes because now question? We can trade anything. We have only ourselves. What is there just now happens Dawei? What have you done with the guys? After the death of my parents I learned various martial arts, that I may be stronger and can protect my friends. I know how we can save Yan Yan. Will Manny meet somewhere with us? - As long as his bodyguards are. Can you lay it on the cross Manny and his bodyguards? - Children's. Dawei, I think you're a big hero, I'm not. I'm just your friend. - That's what a real hero says. So you come up with and fight with us? When it is time to act, act! Running as a hero by the world! Buesheimer? Gary Buesheimer? It is the buyer, yes? Correct. - Did he give you $ 500,000? Jep, down to the last penny. - Nice that everything went so smoothly. It is reasonable, just like you. - Ah. Good. I heard that he is to be a difficult test. Well, you never know who to believe. - Frankly, it was very cool. We were still a while in his house. We got the coal. You Yan Yan. Let us swap. Bring them to the corner ... - Whoa, sister. I say at what is running. But we have the coal. - And I got the girl. Currently it is not riddled with bullets. So, I'll tell you now how it works. We do it on the Pink Party. Pink Party? - Yes, because I always wanted to go there. If Buesheimer and you, as you say, now you are best friends, should it be a problem to get us a few invitations for the party. You're become a VIP. but Is' s breeze. Yes. Yes, of course. It's just ... - I want to talk to Yan Yan. Xiaoming asks whether it Yan Yan goes well. Hello? Xiaoming -. Yan Yan. I've heard you want to save me, but I do not think ... - Yan Yan. See you at the party, man. Which party? The exchange shall be at the Pink Party, among all the people there. In this party one comes only by personal invitation. The Pink Party is the most exclusive event in Hollywood. Not even the employees know the location of the party until it takes place. And we must make the exchange under Buesheimers nose, which is likely to be quite difficult. This is Hollywood. Everything is possible here. Nothing is impossible. Impossible! Get out! What's happening? Do you have tomatoes on the ears? Frankly that already. Oh, I'm concerned we can try if it was hard of hearing so times. No! Still 's director who feels lonely and empty. Commend him a pet! Hey, what did you just say about me? - Uh, he said he understands your feelings. Oh, you understand? You understand my feelings? Yes, you sneak on my film set, ruined my action scene, and now you are asking me for help! Why should I order everything in the world to help you? Three words: Fick Gary Buesheimer. Barbara, put through any calls. Give me the invitation. All right. Hi! - Why do you have a dress? Just so I can feel really comfortable. Who is missing is Yan Yan. His people will be there with her. I see this to me. And where is Buesheimer? - He'll still. Where is Yan Yan? Come on, bro, I'm not that stupid. Huh? Where's the cash? Great! Schaff purely the princess. There he comes! Gary Buesheimer is here! - Hey, Gary! Sorry. Uh, hi -. Hey! Say nothing. I know what you mean. This city, right? Everybody likes them, but it is a cage, a golden cage. But a cage is still a cage, am I right? - Cage? You understand me, right? I love your eyes. Are you from Spain? You're so mysterious. - Mysterious? Yes, but sometimes you can see behind the mystery. Sometimes I feel that I can look into a person. And you have eyes that can not lie. I have a magic dust that blows you your brain and tickle your soul. Has your soul ever tickled? Where is Yan Yan? - Come on, Bro. Soak up the party. I welcome even the man whose life I have improved for years. Wait! Wait! - What is? You want him not interfere while he is employed. What can I say, I'm a fan. Mr. Buesheimer, it has been an honor to do business with you. Businesses? Who are you? Let us go out of the cage. All these years I have your needs met. Are you coming? I need your sexy wand. How did you get in here? - Dead easy. I'm still friends. Friends? I thought you had you taken care of the types, huh? Obviously not. My parents have always said: You have to go into the distance, so there are no problems in the vicinity. This is Hollywood. Nothing is impossible. If we do not come to the Pink Party, we throw our own Pink Party. Whether big things or little things, you should always have a plan. Where's Gary Buesheimer? And remember, it always comes down to the details. The car salesman manual describes the three steps to success. Be proactive, stay engaged and eliminate the work with a smile. $ 500,000? - You get so again. Fick Gary Buesheimer, remember? The director brings his actors on stage. In Hollywood, nothing is impossible. You just have to believe in it, even if only one driver is replaced. I have never really understood what my parents really meant. Only through my time in America, I understood her advice. You have to go into the distance, is not to worry about the future, but to have the courage to face a new problem. Bro, the deal is off. - Do you think you can rip me off? Huh? We can not let escape this son of a bitch. Here I am! Dawei, help me now! - Got it, man! Get out! Take care of the! Hey, the key! - Thank you. Hey! Hey! Hey, thank you lend me your car. Hey! What's going on here? - Zip your lips! Give me the bag! Fernando, you are useless, get out! You all disappear! You're Fired! I do not want you to see! Damned useless shit gang! Okay, baby. Let us dance away! We will do that, baby! Oh yes, we will do. Wronald? Whoa! Stop the crap! Let me out! - Do you think well! This is for Kelly! Eight, nine, twelve thousand. Safety takes priority. Beginner! Strap yourself in, Pretty. Xiaoming, rette sie. Hasta la vista. The fucking bastard escaped us. Fahr Du! What you up to? - I'm supposed to listen to my stomach. Worth it! Accelerate! Overtaking him! Hold on! Let me out! Shoot his front tire. You're Robocop. Trust me. Now I got you! Is a breeze. So what's only in the film. So an action is completely unrealistic. Have not you always been told us, that's Hollywood, because nothing is impossible. I told you that dost thou vindicate yourself as a hero, Xiaoming. You saved me. Hands up! Nobody moves! - No movement! You're surrounded! On the legs! This is Gary Buesheimer, the movie star and philanthropist. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will ... Oh, you're like a Christmas pig! - ... Be used against you. I'm not interested. - God is the disturbed! That's enough. Incidentally, your last film was shit. Put your hands behind your back. - Do not Jump, Bro. Shut up! - I'm an innocent immigrants. At the end of a film is always all the problems will be gone dissolve. The good ones have saved the world. The hero gets the beautiful girl. And love is victorious. Goodbye, Troublemaker. Your friend gave us. I say it for the last time: This is not a fucking movie! And I'm not a hero! I'm just a big idiot, middle of the desert. Can you emphasize the word idiot more and the last sentence to say it again? Do you think I would have the trouble made to me with this import thing which works great, uncovered your name at the cops, then to be a delivery boy, while the FBI me ass smells? There 'nen reason I've tricked you, Bro. For you will make the delivery. - You may go now. You'll bring me my money. And this is not a game, Wei Wei, but only 'ne business decision. Movies have a think over again that everyone can find the one that belongs to him. And then the two live happily together until the day she died. But life is no Hollywood movie. Life is life. And genuine love upsets a total, so you would do anything to make the other happy. Even if it means that the other must disappear from his life. In real love there are no guarantees. Nothing is predestined. There are no fireworks and no Hollywood happy ending. Miss Zhao Wei Wei. Welcome to your new life. I am your guide Xiaoming. Uh, is there anything special that you want to do during your stay? I just really tells something about the happy ending in Hollywood movies. Forget it. I did not say anything. Troublemaker. Please come to bed. I'm bored way. Hey, free country. Have not we forgotten something? Was sagst du? Radio, na klar! Ah! Oh no. - All done. Thank you very much. A wonderful stay in America. - Put on the gloves! Sorry. That you come to our country, does not mean that we come in you. Even 'ne Recording! You saved me. Child's play. - Stop that! Shit, the cattle has pulled the trigger! - Everything full. Come out, Piggy! All men in the beds! No, I mean, all hands on the guns! No! No, no, I'm not. Welcome to America. Flap, the first! Hollywood. Here I come!
