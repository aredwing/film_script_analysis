LOOK, I'M SORRY SHE'S GETTING ALL THE ATTENTION. ARE YOU? I MEAN, THAT'S WHY YOU MADE HER, RIGHT? THE BAND NEEDED AN IMAGE. YOU SAY THAT LIKE IT'S A BAD THING. THINGS JUST AREN' TURNING OU THE WAY I WANTED, ALL RIGHT? YOU'VE STILL GO THAT EXTRA DATA CELL, DON'T YOU? WHY DON'T YOU TAKE LORETTA FOR A WHILE? HUH? THEN THEY COULD DO A STORY ON YOU AND HOW THE TWO OF YOU ARE FRIENDS. WE ARE? YOU COULD TRY TO BE. TELL YOU WHAT, ROSCOE, IF SHE BECOMES TOO MUCH FOR YOU, E-MAIL HER TO ME. DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? STUDYING YOUR CREATION. HOW DID YOU COMPENSATE FOR THE AMBIENT ROOM LIGHT? UH, VARIABLE INTENSITY SUB-ROUTINE. DAD, PLEASE, YOU'RE EMBARRASSING HER. IT'S OK, ROSCOE. I DON'T MIND. HEY, DAD, YOU NEED TO WARN HER BEFORE YOU DO THAT. I HAVE TO HAND I TO YOU, ROSCOE. WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HERE IS AMAZING. OF COURSE, A HOLOGRAPHIC ROCK STAR ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND. DAD, DON'T START. BUT SHE'S A GOOD BEGINNING. NOW LET'S JUST MOVE BEYOND IT. WHY CAN'T YOU JUST APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE GO RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU? I MEAN, YOU SAW HER. BUT DID YOU SEE WHO SHE IS? WHO SHE'S BECOMING? SHE CAN'T BECOME ANYTHING. SH-- IT--IT'S A HOLOGRAM. NO, SHE'S AN INDIVIDUAL. SHE HAS THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS, JUST LIKE YOU AND ME. NO. SHE'S A BLEND OF LIGHT AND COLOR. LIKE-- WELL, LIKE AN ABSTRACT PAINTING. IT'S VIBRANT, IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BUT IN THE END, IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO LOOK AT, NOTHING MORE. REALLY? WELL, THAT NOTHING SAVED YOU YOUR FUNDING. THANKS TO HER, YOU'RE SKYGRAPH'S FAVORITE EMPLOYEE. THAT WASN'T HER. THAT WAS YOU. BY CREATING HER, YOU MIGHT HAVE-- YOU MIGHT HAVE EVEN SAVED MY JOB. GLAD YOU NOTICED. I'M GOING FOR A WALK. ROSCOE, I WROTE A SONG. TELL ME IT'S BRILLIANT. TELL ME IT'S PERFECT. "I BELIEVE IN YESTERDAY, DANIEL MY BROTHER, HEY, NOW YOU'RE A ROCK STAR, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER?" ISN'T IT GREAT? LORETTA, THESE ARE JUS LINES FROM OTHER SONGS. YEAH, BUT I PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER. YOU WANT TO HEAR THE MUSIC? NO, I KNOW THE MUSIC. LORETTA, YOU CAN'T JUS TAKE BITS AND PIECES OF OTHER SONGS. WHY NOT? YOU MADE ME OUT OF BITS AND PIECES OF OTHER PEOPLE. TH-THAT'S DIFFERENT. HOW? IT JUST IS. OK, LOOK, I KNOW YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS. MAYBE I'LL WRITE YOU A NEW CREATIVE PLUG-IN. NO! YOU ALWAYS WANT TO CHANGE ME. WHY AM I NEVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. YOU SAID I WAS PERFECT. YEAH. HMPH. WELL, EVEN PERFECTION HAS ITS LIMITS. I WANT TO GO TO THE MALL. HUH. YOU CAN'T. THE MALL'S CLOSED. NOT IN JAPAN. WE CAN'T GO TO JAPAN. YOU CAN'T GO BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A HOLOGRAM, BUT I CAN UPLOAD STRAIGHT TO TOKYO. SO WHO'S LIMITED NOW? DOWNLOADING FROM THE NE IS MUCH DIFFEREN THAN UPLOADING. IF YOU UPLOAD, THE NET WILL TEAR YOU APART. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT GONNA HAVE THIS ARGUMENT. FINE. THEN JUS REPROGRAM ME TO NOT ARGUE. MAYBE I WILL. THAT'S IT. I'M LEAVING. Roscoe: LORETTA, WAIT! IF YOU STEP OU THAT DOOR, YOU'LL BE GONE FOREVER. IS THAT YOU WANT? [BARKING] IT'S NOT FAIR YOU MADE ME LIKE THIS. YOU SHOULD'VE MADE ME REAL. LOOK, FROM NOW ON NO MORE TINKERING WITH YOUR PROGRAMS. ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE ALREADY EVERYTHING I WANTED YOU TO BE.

NO WAY OUT, WAY OUT WEST, WAY OUT ON A LIMB. HA HA HA! OH! [CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYING] HEY, ARE YOU LOOKING TO REFINANCE? WE'VE GOT THE LOWES MORTGAGE RATES! HUH, HUH? WHAT DO YOU SAY? GET LOST! [CIRCUS MUSIC WARPS OUT] I HATE POP-UP ADS. POP! POP! POP! I HATE 'EM, I HATE 'EM. OK, HOLD ON. WHAT'S THAT OVER THERE? THAT? A SERVER. PRETTY BIG ONE BY THE LOOK OF IT. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY, YOU DON' WANT TO GO THERE! E-MAIL. I CAN ATTACH MYSELF TO AN E-MAIL. I JUST NEED TO FIND THE RIGHT ONE. EXCUSE ME. IS THIS SORTED ALPHABETICALLY OR BY DOMAIN? VIRUS ALERT, VIRUS ALERT! WHAT? [ALARM] [BARKING] OH! OH. HELLO? CAN ANYONE HELP ME? I'M LOST. NAME? LORETTA MODERN. I NEED TO FIND-- DO YOU HAVE AN E-MAIL ADDRESS? YES. WE CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACCIDENTAL DELETIONS, POWER SURGES, OR DATA CORRUPTIONS. MM-HMM. [BUZZER] YEOW! AAH! Computer: YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE. Loretta: SAMANTHA, HELP ME! WHAT? IT'S ME--LORETTA! UHH! ROSCOE E-MAILED YOU TO ME? I WAS ONLY KIDDING. QUICK, PLUG IN MY DATA CELL. UHH. OH, FINE. IF ROSCOE WANTS TO PLAY GAMES, I CAN PLAY GAMES, TOO. [CELL CLICKS] THERE YOU ARE, LORETTA. SAFE AND SOUND. AND YOU CAN STAY THERE TILL THE NEXT ICE AGE FOR ALL I CARE. [TIRES SQUEAL] WHERE'S SAMANTHA? SHE'S INSIDE. WHOA, SLOW DOWN, ROSCOE. LORETTA'S GONE. GONE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN GONE? WE HAD A FIGHT. SHE WENT INTO THE NET. WHAT DID YOU TELL HER? "MY WAY OR THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY?" I DON'T THINK YOU GET IT. THE INTERNET'S LIKE A TORNADO FOR HER. SHE COULD BE SHREDDED BETWEEN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT SERVERS. I'M SURE SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF. I WAS UP ALL NIGH TRYING TO TRACE HER. WHAT'S THE BAND GONNA DO WITHOUT HER? IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BAND. IT'S ABOUT YOU. WHAT? YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HER. [SCOFFS] DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. OF COURSE YOU ARE. YOU DESIGNED HER TO BE YOUR PERFECT GIRL. HOW COULD YOU HELP BUT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER? SHE CAN SING, SHE CAN DANCE, SHE'S FUNNY AND BEAUTIFUL. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, ROSCOE? SHE'S NOT REAL. WHAT IS REAL, ANYWAY? ME. I'M REAL. AND I'M RIGHT HERE. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN RIGHT HERE. SAM, I-- [FRUSTRATED SIGH] I'VE GOT HER. WHAT? LORETTA. SHE FOUND HER WAY TO MY COMPUTER. WELL, THEN SHE'S OK? SHE'S FINE. OH! I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE. THANK YOU. YOU, UH, REMEMBER THE LAST THING SUSAN SAID TO YOU? WHAT? SUSAN. YOUR LAST GIRLFRIEND. I HAVEN'T THOUGH ABOUT HER IN AGES. SHE SAID, "I HOPE YOU LIKE EATING ALONE." THEN SHE SLAMMED THE DOOR. SHE WAS VERY GOOD AT SLAMMING DOORS. HEH! SO, UH... YOU LIKE EATING ALONE? I'M NOT ALONE. I'VE GOT YOU. MY BUSINESS PARTNER. HEH! MOM SLAMMED DOORS, TOO? WHAT, ARE YOU WRITING A PAPER ON MY FAILED RELATIONSHIPS? NO, UH--THANKS. I'M JUST WONDERING WHY YOU NEVER GO MARRIED AGAIN. I GUESS I WAS-- LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT I NEVER QUITE FOUND. PERFECTION? YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS BELIEVED IN THE PERFECT MATCH, THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO'D BE EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED AND WE WOULD SORT OF COMPLETE EACH OTHER. BUT YOU NEVER FOUND HER. WELL, PERFECTION'S A FUNNY THING. I MEAN, LOOK HOW PERFECT THIS IS. THE WAY THE CRYSTAL CAPTURES THE LIGHT, REFRACTS I INTO BEAUTIFUL PATTERNS. SILICON'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT? YOU CAN MOLD IT INTO GLASS OR COMPUTER CHIPS, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NOT ALIVE. AND THE MORE YOU TRY TO FIND THAT KIND OF PERFECTION IN PEOPLE, THE MORE MEALS... YOU WILL EAT ALONE. [SWEEPING ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] Roscoe: IT'S AMAZING. THE INTERNE DIDN'T DAMAGE YOUR PATTERN AT ALL. ROSCOE... WHAT'S IT LIKE TO FEEL? WHAT'S IT LIKE TO TOUCH? I'M NOT REALLY SURE IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN EXPLAIN. TRY? OK. UH, ALL RIGHT. CLOSE YOUR EYES. NOW...IMAGINE A DANCE FLOOR. YOU AND YOUR PARTNER ARE DANCING TO THE BEAT. HIP-HOP OR ROCK? OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE SUDDENLY IT CHANGES. IT SLOWS DOWN TO A BALLAD. OK. HE TOUCHES YOUR HAIR. IT FEELS LIKE... LIKE A VIOLIN GENTLY PLAYING. YOU TOUCH HIS CHEEK. IT FEELS LIKE... LIKE A FLUTE HOLDING A SINGLE QUAVERING NOTE HIGH ABOVE THE REST. YOU PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER AND BEGIN TO DANCE. THE EMBRACE FEELS LIKE A CELLO HARMONIZING WITH THE VIOLIN. OK. NOW OPEN YOUR EYES. THERE. THERE. YOU FEEL THAT? NO. I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING. THAT'S OK. ME, NEITHER. NOTHING AT ALL. GUESS YOU AND I NEVER WILL. YOU'RE SO RESPONSIBLE I TAKE CONTROL AND THEN I MAKE MY MIND UP THAT I WON'T LET GO NOW KEEP MY DISTANCE I GOT STRONG RESISTANCE I CAN DEFEND MYSELF AGAINST ALL THE UNKNOWNS REALLY THOUGH THAT I WOULD MAKE IT MAN, I THOUGH THAT I WOULD MAKE IT AND THEN ONE DAY AND THEN ONE DAY MY WORLD FELL APART ALL MY PROMISES WERE BROKEN AND THEN ONE DAY AND THEN ONE DAY YOU INVADED MY HEART... OK. THERE'S NO NEED TO BE NERVOUS. I'M FINE. I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE HE'S PRESIDEN OF THE RECORD COMPANY AND HE'S MEETING, WELL, RIGHT NOW WITH MY BOSS, THAT'S NO REASON TO BE INTIMIDATED. I'M NOT. GOOD. I'VE GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM. AGAIN? YEAH. HEH! THAT LOOKS LIKE DARYL. Roscoe: IT IS. BACK WHEN HE WAS RAPPER DE FIBB. HE LOOKS SO MEAN. EH, IT'S ALL IMAGE. AH, THAT WAS MY DEBUT ALBUM. WENT DOUBLE PLATINUM. BARELY MADE A PENNY, THOUGH. HARSHTONE RECORDS GOT ALL THE MONEY. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. MAYBE NOT. BUT EVERY PERFORMER HAS A CHOICE. WELDON GILES OFFERED ME A CONTRACT. IT WAS MY CHOICE TO SIGN IT. I'M GLAD I DON' HAVE TO WORRY ABOU THINGS LIKE MONEY. OR MEETINGS. MR. GILES WOULD PREFER THAT LORETTA WASN' IN OUR DISCUSSION. Giles: YOU AND YOUR SON HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. YOU'VE GIVEN I NEW LIFE. LORETTA MODERN'S ON HER WAY TO BEING A HOUSEHOLD NAME. SKYGRAPH'S ENTERING INTO A PARTNERSHIP WITH HARSHTONE, XANDER. WITH YOU SPEARHEADING THE NEW DIVISION. HEH! I--I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. WE WILL CORNER THE MARKE ON HOLOGRAPHIC PERFORMERS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY 'EM, YOU DON' HAVE TO FEED 'EM, AND WHEN THEY'RE NOT ON STAGE, YOU CAN PUT 'EM AWAY. THAT'S THE KIND OF PERFORMER I LIKE. HOW ARE THE HOLOGRAMS GONNA FEEL ABOUT THAT? UH... [ALL CHUCKLING] FUNNY KID. ROSCOE, I'M GIVING YOU AND YOUR FATHER FREE CREATIVE REIN TO DEVELOP NEW HOLOGRAPHIC PERSONALITIES. IN THE MEANTIME, WE'LL EXPLOI THE ONE WE'VE GOT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE ONE YOU'VE GOT? WE PURCHASED LORETTA FROM SKYGRAPH. NO. THEY CAN' JUST BUY HER. WELL, THEY PURCHASE COMPUTER PROGRAMS ALL THE TIME. YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY BOUGHT YOU, TOO. ROSCOE, I KNOW LORETTA MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN INDIVIDUAL, BUT SHE'S NOT. THEN WHAT IS SHE? PROPERTY. AND NOW SHE'S MY PROPERTY, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. ROSCOE, LET'S JUST STEP OUTSIDE AND TALK CALMLY ABOUT THIS. YEAH, I KNOW. LIKE BUSINESS PARTNERS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER. I'M YOUR SON. AHEM. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE LORETTAS OF EVERY ETHNICITY-- ASIAN, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC. Giles: IT'S BRILLIANT... NO. WE'LL MOLD LORETTA INTO WHATEVER WE WANT HER TO BE. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, XANDER? XANDER? Y-YES. YES, WE CAN DO ALL OF THAT. BUT JUST BECAUSE WE CAN DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD. I'M SORRY, BUT I'M WITH MY SON ON THIS. WHETHER LORETTA IS A PERSON OR A PROGRAM, SHE DESERVES TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. FINE. I'LL SET UP A TASK FORCE ON HOLOGRAM ETHICS. DARYL, COULD YOU PLEASE TAKE THE DATA CELL? NOW. I'M SORRY, ROSCOE. IT'S NOT FAIR. I NEED SECURITY IN HERE. XANDER, TALK TO YOUR SON. COME ON! YOU KNOW, FOR ONCE THAT'S EXACTLY WHA I INTEND TO DO. HOW COULD YOU LET HIM DO THIS? YOU SAID EVERY PERFORMER HAS A CHOICE. HOW ABOUT LORETTA? WHERE'S HER CHOICE? ALL RIGHT, SIR, LET'S GO. I WANT THA UNDER LOCK AND KEY. WE WON'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. YOU CREATED LORETTA. WE WON'T LET THEM DO THIS TO YOU OR TO HER. WHAT IS IT? NOTHING. HEY, DAD, IF I WERE TO TELL YOU HOW PROUD I WAS TO BE YOUR SON, WOULD YOU GE ALL MUSHY ON ME? WHO ME? NO. GOOD, GOOD. 'CAUSE, UH, I AM PROUD. DAD! Xander: WHOA! I'M OK, I'M OK! I'M DONE. [DATA CELL POWERS UP] WHERE AM I? ROSCOE? YOU HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE, LORETTA. ROSCOE CAN' MAKE IT FOR YOU, NEITHER CAN I. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU CAN STAY HERE. IF YOU DO, HARSHTONE WILL OWN YOU. YOU'LL PERFORM WHEN THEY TELL YOU. ALL I WANT TO DO IS PERFORM. THEN MAYBE THIS IS WHERE YOU BELONG. BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND. YOUR HANDHELD. WITH WIRELESS WEB. I UPLOADED ONCE. THE CHOICE IS YOURS. Giles: FIBBS, ARE YOU IN THERE? I HOPE YOU'RE TAKING GOOD CARE OF MY GIRL. Daryl, voice-over: "DEAR MR. GILES, "AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, "I'VE DECIDED TO FREE MYSELF "FROM YOU AND HARSHTONE RECORDS. "I BELIEVE OUR FRIEND LORETTA MODERN HAS CHOSEN TO DO THE SAME." SINCERELY, DARYL J. FIBBS." HEH!

OH, I UNDERSTAND JUST FINE. HE'S A LYING, CHEATING, SELF-SERVING, UNDERHANDED ARROGAN BALL OF SLIME! ARE YOU DONE? NO, I'M NOT DONE. OK. NOW I'M DONE. SO AM I. I RESIGNED FROM HARSHTONE. WHAT?

WHEN YOU DIDN' SHOW UP TO THE CONCER SHE TRIED TO TAKE YOUR PLACE. WELL, SOMEONE SHOULD BE FIXING HER, RUNNING DIAGNOSTICS. SHE FELL AND HIT HER HEAD. IT'S NOT THAT EASY. ROSCOE, YOU FIX HER. I CAN'T. ALL WE CAN DO IS WAIT. COME ON. WE'LL WAI WITH THE OTHERS. NO. I WANT TO STAY HERE. LORETTA. THIS MACHINE. WHAT IS IT? WHAT DOES IT DO? E.E.G. IT MEASURES BRAIN ACTIVITY.

THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. I WISH I COULD LEARN TO PLAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ROSCOE COULD PROGRAM YOU. IT'S NOT THE SAME AS LEARNING. YOU GET TO MAKE MISTAKES. YOU GET TO SEE YOURSELF GET BETTER LITTLE BY LITTLE, SO WHEN YOU FINALLY GET THERE IT ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING. ALL THIS TIME I'VE BEEN JEALOUS OF YOU BECAUSE IT ALL CAME SO EASY TO YOU. HEH! SINGING, DANCING, PERFECT PERSONALITY-- PERFECT! UGH! I HATE THAT WORD. IF I'M SO PERFECT, WHY DO I FEEL SO LIMITED? I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS PLACE YOU'VE CREATED. YOU'RE SO LUCKY. SAMANTHA, YOU GE TO BE THE DREAMER, BUT ALL I'LL EVER BE IS THE DREAM. I NEVER THOUGH OF IT THAT WAY. YOU'RE LOSING YOUR PATTERN. SO ARE YOU.
