Empty feet. - Come on. Try once more. Yes, one more. Come on. - Come on. Bravo . Be brave. Come on. What are you looking at, Bobby? He's been in pain for so long. Take a look, Bobby. We spent a lot to make you a doctor. You take a look. Come on. Just a second. It's this one. This one, Bobby. Come on, lift your leg. Lift this one. A little more. A little more. A little more. That's it. I cannot lift it any more. How high could you raise it earlier? Earlier I could lift it this high. I see. But now...I cannot raise it any more. Down a peg and you'll be fine. Get it. - Run away. Go. Naughty boy! Similar thing happened with my uncle. He was a restless person. He fell from the roof and never got up. Oh, God. Did he die? No, no. He had para-lysis. Para-lysis. Para-lysis. - Yes. Bobby, is he getting para-lysis. No, no. Before para-lysis the patient gets a big shock. The entire body starts to ache" ...and the small finger of the right hand starts to quiver. I see. Liar. What's the connection between the two? Look.. - Bobby, will I be fine? It's quivering? His finger's quivering. It's quivering. He's body's aching as well. Oh, God. What's wrong with him? It's quivering, Bobby. - It's quivering. I knew this was going to happen. Don't just stand there. What should we do now? Fine, I'll prescribe some medicines. Until then look after him. Thank you, thank you. If he doesn't get well, then we'll take him to the hospital.. ...and operate on him. - What? Why are you laughing? Will he get well? Say it, don't laugh like someone insane. He's just putting up a charade? He doesn't want to leave. - Liar. Why was his finger quivering, why was he restless? You look more restless than him. He's absolutely fine. I just fibbed and he got on. By the way, is he in love with you? Don't talk nonsense. Fine, then tell me about your statues. Are you.. Jerk, scoundrel, move. Sukh. Sukh. "The sweet intoxications." "Indicates I'm falling in love." "How do I say, you protect me from all vices?" "You protect me from all vices? "I keep drinking from your intoxicating eyes." "From your intoxicating eyes."

"Both depend on luck. This isn't... This isn't my lid. Wasn't my pickle? - But it was your idea. Brother, I only came here to sell my ancestral property. I've nothing to do with enemies and enmity. I didn't commit any sin. Maybe it's an old sin, committed by your father. Why punish the child for it? When children can be bequeathed" ...with their father's property, then why can't they.. ...pay for their sins. You can endure all the pain you want. Because tomorrow I will take care of all your pain. Tomorrow I will finish the job, that I couldn't today. That's Balwinder Singh Sandhu's promise to you. Try smiling sometimes. Pammi. Billoo. Forgive me, Pammi. I didn't see you. That's the problem, Billoo. You never take a look at me. Let go, Pammi. What if someone sees us? Forget the people, you look at me. Pammi, please. The heart gets restless. Let go, Pammi. A heart that doesn't beat... A veil that doesn't slip... A man that doesn't cry... And a lover, who's never restless, is impossible. Billoo, don't you ever think about me? Pammi, please. Pammi, I want to give you the moon and the stars. That's what I think. But what to do? First of all, I can't reach the sky.. ...and secondly the heart thinks this way. Then why don't you come meet me during the day. Just like we used to 25 years ago. Remember, when I used to bunk school" ...and come meet you in Gopi's sugarcane field. Remember? Pammi. Don't remind me. It makes me romantic. Gopi's sugarcane and Hindi film hero Rajesh Khanna.. ...can never be forgotten. Forget it. Forget it. We did it. We made quick work out of him. Brother. This was a pillow. Then where is he? Brother. Try laughing sometimes. I knew you had laid a trap. But I am a lion. Then come out, rascal. - Really? Okay, then here I come. Come on! Come- on! Here I come. Come on! Come- on! Here I come. Come on! Here I come. Get lost. Move back. Get lost. I am a lion, not a dog.. ...who will come out when you want. I only follow my mood, and right now I am not in the mood. Right now I am sleepy, so I am off to bed. Goodnight, and sleep tight. Brother, I didn't understand one thing. How does this Sardar move his chest? Quiet! Good morning. Try laughing sometimes. Why do I feel that you wanted to kill me in my sleep? Brother, I was just giving you the pillow. - I see. But we never accept anything from guests. Not even pillows. We only give. I don't believe it. Then don't, I don't care. Brother, that's a nice jacket. Jacket. Here keep it. I've a big heart. It's from Canada. - I see. And the loincloth. That's from Karnal. Keep this too. Mobile phone. - That's mine. Can I touch it? We fulfil all the wishes of our guests. And those who aren't going to live for long.. ...we never turn clown any of their desires. Take it. It's okay. Thank you. - No thank you, mention not. He doesn't know that we can give guests anything. But only until he's inside the house. We take everything back as soon as he sets out. His life too. Hello, Mr. Sandhu. So, Gogi Chaudhary. What are you doing here today? Why? Are police not allowed here? We respect every guest in our house, even fools. You're a government official. How can we be of assistance? There's a report against you in the police station. - I see. We've been told that you've imprisoned a guest in your house. And all of you torture him and don't let him come out. We want him to come out. But that rascal doesn't come out. Right, Tito. - Yes, brother. Yes. So that you can kill me. Inspector, I called you. What now? I am out. Talk to the law now. Right Titu. And Tony. Brother, try laughing sometimes. Anyone can act brave in their house. Teeche, Kaale, Santa, Banta, Lovely and Chhinda. - Oh no! I swear on my father. And my mother's upbringing, come and face me.. ...In a no-man's land, if you can. And they want to take revenge. Sir. Before my blood starts to boil and lose control" "take me away from here. Take me away. Who gave him a phone? I did, brother. He's our guest. Great, Tony. Why you.. Inspector, don't be fooled, I am really a decent man. I don't take the law in my hands. Otherwise, I would've have handled them alone. You know the Punjabi's are the best and the rest come second. Inspector. Is there a Fevicol add at the back. - No. Then why are they coming after us? It's democracy. I can't stop them from following me. Look ahead. Here we are. Thank you. I knew that you're a useful man. You're a Sardar, I'm a Sardar, and the rest are good for nothing. That's why Punjabi's are called a fearless race. Doesn't this police station look too old? This isn't the police station. It's a no man's land. - I see. Sandhu sir. Your guest is out of your home, my job's done. Anything else. Thank you, Chaudhary. Goodbye. Inspector. Unlawful man. You were right. Anyone can act brave in their house. But a lion is always a lion. Brother, I admit that you're the king of the jungle. It just slipped, but I respect you a lot. Tito. Rip his heart out. Let's see how much he respects me-. Just a minute, Tito, try to understand. Billoo. There are 20 of you, armed. And I am all alone, unarmed. The competition should be equal. Just a minute. Just a minute. Just a minute. Brother, I am a Sikh. And one Sikh is equal to 125,000 people. There are just 20 of you. Go get 124,980 more. Then we'll talk. This Sardar believes in fair competition. Let's talk, Move aside. Right. Brother. We don't have that many people in the entire village. Really? Brother, I think he's fooling us. And we're getting duped. - Yes. Oh yes. Stop- If you're Sardar then we're Sandhu. - Yes, brother. Stop, Kaale, Santa, Banta and Babbu. Just a minute. Brother. That's 650,000. And I can equal only 125,000. This isn't fair. Brother, brother. I won't fight. What the.. catch him. Not me, him. Catch him! Why you.. Brother, brother. Brother. Brother, try smiling sometimes. Where did he go? Brother, what is better, horse or jeep? - Horse. Then you should've bought horses. We would've saved petrol, and it can go anywhere. And horses give birth to other horses. Jeep can't give birth. Shut up. Uncle, open the door. Oh, that hurt bad. Hey, where are we? Uncle- My brother just crashed somewhere here. Did you see him? Rascal, it's me. Hey, where's the Sardar? Jassi. I'm not coming back. Jassi. Hey, he's calling me not you. Is your name Jassi.. Your name's Jassi as well. Jassi. Jassi, stop. Jassi, let me get clown. Jassi, just a minute. Jassi. Brother Jassi. Brother Jassi, at least help me down. Brother Jassi. What the.. Good morning. Sardar, you've very romantic. Actually, it's the situation. I see. By the way, you look so fresh after a bath. Liar. - Really. Private talk. Shall I go? - Yes. No, wait. Where are you going? I am going, sister-in-law's calling me. Rascal, did you have to come now. So, Sardar, how's the pain? Pain? - Yes. It's fine now. By the way, you've a wonderful timing. Sister'-in-law's calling me as well. He's inside the house again. Brother, I've an idea. Say it. We cannot kill him in our house. Why don't we sell our house? Then this won't be our house nor will he be our guest. Then we can kill him. Right? Isn't that right? Billoo. Do you like the idea? Come here, son. I told you.. What the.. Childhood knickers don't fit when you grow up. And you don't get a free hit on every no-ball. Get lost. - Great idea. Sell the house. Want a slap. - No. Tito. - Yes. Call for reinforcements. Today is 'Lodhi'. He might give us the slip between the guests. Call the forces from Gurdaspur. Come on. I'm done for. I think this is my last night. Where should I go? Sardar, try smiling sometimes. I always smile. I got a little emotional while leaving the house. - I see. I can't endure separation. - Liar. Really? I wanted to tell you something. - I already know. You do. How? I can see everything. Do you take me for a fool? I knew when you made up the back pain. What? Couldn't you tell me earlier? I was so scared. You could've told me as well. Given me a hunch in the train itself. How could I? I found out only after coming here. What if brother Billoo finds out? - He knows. What? He will kill you. That's what I am afraid of. Don't worry, I will talk to brother. He will listen to me. Only if I am alive. Sukh. - Coming. I'm going Listen, keep smiling. You look nice smiling. Look after yourself. You are there for that. "With your love, I'll forget the world." "Just your love." Are you too smart? - Yes. You're a Sardar, I am a Sardar the rest are good for nothing. I see. Sardar's in love. Do you know, Sardar's become dangerous in love? Smart alec, come here. How do you know? First Sardar falls in love. Then he's heart-broken. And then Sardar downs a peg. And you know a drunk Sardar can be so dangerous. I know, because" You're a Sardar, I am a Sardar the rest are good for nothing. Spoken like a true Sardar. Bobby. Bobby. What happened? - I'm in love, Bobby. So that tall, dark Sardar finally admitted. - Of course. What did he say? - He's a Sardar, he won't say it directly. I'm in love. Aunt's best friend. They're marriage's been fixed. How about that peg? First let me get sober from the first one. Sardar, how am I looking? Say it, how am I looking? Gorgeous. Gorgeous lass. You know, this dress belongs to my mother. Every time she wore it, daddy would say "Gorgeous lass". "With you by my side, I can win the world." Is that your daddy's photo? Our ancestral enemies killed my son. Until we don't avenge his death ...Sandhu family cannot rest in peace. Do you know how fatherless children are raised? I know, aunt. Congratulations for the Lothi. How about a drink? Offering alcohol to your enemy? Alcohol is a rascal of a thing. Drink it with friends, it strengthens the friendship. Drink it with enemies, and it kills him. How about a sip? "The moon's shining bright." "The heart's skipping a beat." "The moon's shining bright." "The heart's skipping a beat."

Where's the uncle from Hoshiyaarpur? Come here. Billoo. - Yes. The entire family's gathered here. So announce Bobby and Sukh's marriage today. Yes, it's a great day. It's Lodhi. Let's fix the date. Say it, Billoo. Why are you quiet? Pammi, there's something important left to do. After that we'll get married along with them. Aunt Pammi, we'll talk about this later. - Yes. That's exactly how I grew so old. But I won't let you and Sukh separate. No, never. Tell me. Did I ask him for a piece of property? - No, not at all. Did I ask him for clothing or sari? - No. Did I ask him for a car or bungalow? - No. See. So, can't this guy do this much for his future-wife? Say it. Billoo. Pammi is right. Say yes. - Tell him. Yes. Pammi, don't cry. Don't cry. - No. You know. Tears from your eyes, and cheers with empty glasses" ...is something I don't like at all. Let's get them engaged tomorrow. Congratulations. Say something, Bobby. - Just a minute. Congratulations. Just a minute. I cannot agree to this marriage. Why not? I am sorry but I never thought about marrying Sukh. What are you saying? Please try and understand. What nonsense? Are you in your right mind? If you didn't want to marry her then why did you follow her around? I will kill you. Tito! Decrease in population and marriage "depends on the person's will, not forcibly. You can all leave. Leave, please. What did you do? - Bobby, what did you do? - Relax. What did you do? - Just a minute. If you don't have good looks, then you should at least say something nice. And if you can't say something nice then you should shut up. Right? Have you ever seen fate? Take a look at her. She's really lucky. Anyone can win the world with her on their side. And you're making her cry. Don't cry, Ms. Fate. You aren't my fate, you belong to him. Ms. Fate, try smiling sometimes. Look, Bobby, you aren't Sunny Deol. ...that all the girls in Punjab are crazy for you. You've got her, so respect her. I've realised in two days, but you couldn't" ...that you won't find someone like her.. ...even if you use the entire powerhouse. Anyone can lay down their life for her. It's her heart, don't break it. It pains. Say yes. Come on, say yes. Bobby. Say yes. Leave the rest on God. Yes. Congratulations. Congratulations. - That's great. Do you see these arms? My uncle died in these arms. And he said just one thing while dying. To avenge his death. Do you see my hands? My mother died in my arms and told me just one thing. Don't ever take up enmity with anyone. Otherwise I can take revenge as well. My father died that day. But my mother forgave all of you. But I cannot forgive you. Tomorrow, Sukh's engagement is at the Gurdwara. Everyone will step out of the house. You will have to. Then I'll see who saves you. Jaswinder Singh Randhawa. You're done for.

"I cannot live after we do." Aren't you attending it? - We will. But only after we kill you. Brother, don't ever crack a joke on a Sardar or mistake him for a joker. If you touch a Sardar's turban, he'll let you have it. Brother, try smiling sometimes. Bobby, I wanted to say something. That you don't want to marry me. I don't want to either. I know that you love Jassi. Rascal, when you knew I love Jassi.. "Then why did you say yes? To save Jassi's life. Yes. Jassi's the guy Sandhu family's been looking for.. ...for the past 25 years. - What! To avenge your father's death. I saw his father's papers in his bag.. ...which is in the name of Harjeet Singh Randhawa. Jassi's name is Jaswinder Singh Randhawa. When I found out that you love him.. ...how could I let him die. This drama was only to let him escape amongst the guests. But that Sardar, madly in love with you. Followed you here. His life's in danger. They will kill him. Don't worry. That Sikh's equal to But you better hurry up before he leaves. I will handle Billoo. And your marriage. Forget about me. Go quickly. Bobby, why don't you say something? Look, Sukh. If he leaves then you're surely make my life miserable. Go. Rascal Bobby, won't you wish me all the best. All the best. Go. What are you doing here? Today's your engagement. We get engaged to those we want to marry. So, aren't you marrying Bobby? We marry only those we love. So don't you love Bobby? If I loved Bobby what would I be doing here? Then who do you love? Your father? - Don't joke. Who started it? I've left my engagement.. ...and you're asking me who I love. So you love... Hey, hold on. We're discussing something important. - Yes, brother. Why didn't you tell me? I did, when you said brother knows. All I said was.. I said wait! Sit down everyone. Sit down. - Sit down. I said I am the guy your brother's been looking for. You don't love me. I.. - See, I ran away. Just tell me what you feel about me.. ...or else I will go back. Your father killed my father. And still you love me. - Yes, so that was your father. Not you. So, I love you. Not your father. What if I say I don't love you? I will kill you. And if I say I love you. Then my brothers will kill you. Is killing your family tradition? So, what were you saying? I fell in love when I saw you the first time. You were a gorgeous thing. So I thought wonder I'll be able to woo you or not? Now that you did, you really are heavy. Liar. Listen. Let's runaway before brother comes. I never run. But there's no reason to stay. But now I do. Do you know what you're doing? If I runaway the enmity will continue. I want to end this enmity. We'll see what happens. And when you're with me, I've nothing to fear. Billoo. Just a minute, Billoo. Stop, Billoo. Billoo, first listen to me. Billoo, don't go. Billoo, stop. Billoo, for the sake of God. Pammi! - Billoo. You want to save the guy you waited for 25 years. You want to save the guy because of whom.. ...you stayed unmarried for 25 years. Billoo, I admit no love story is complete without the union. But isn't an incomplete union, a love story? I waited for 25 years for your love" "but if I get that by killing someone's love, then I don't want it. I will stay unmarried all my life. But I don't want to get married by killing Sukh's love. Sukh loves Jassi. Pammi! Jassi hasn't done anything. It's not his fault". Brother, try smiling.. Brother. You welcomed me so warmly as a guest. This repays for that. No, Jassi Brother. You fed me yourself. So, that's repaid. Stop. - Leave me, brother. You all showered me with so much love. Now that's repaid. Now this enmity ends here. This enmity will end with your death. Brother. It's such an old enmity. Let's finish it with style. Stop! Those who hunt in packs, are thugs. And if the enemy's competent, then killing him is fun. Brother, no. Move. - Move. Brother, why are they hitting each other turn by turn? We're cultured people. - Right. We give our enemy's a chance. Yes. - Hit him, brother. Did you understand now? Brother, stop. You can't kill a guest inside the house. Brother. With great difficulty we got him out of the house. You brought him inside again. Shall we go out again? Jassi, you're back. Where were you? We were waiting for you at the Gurdwara. And, Billoo. What's wrong with you? Why are you two completely drenched? Take a good look, mother. He is Randhawa's son. We've been waiting for him for 25 years. He's our enemy. Enemy? What enemy? We don't have any enemy with anyone. What enmity, son? Tell me. What enmity do we have with anyone? You're such a ham, mother. You know that he's Randhawa's son.. ...who killed your son. Even Monte's motorcycle didn't make a difference to you. Do you remember? You're pretending, aren't you? Son. Memories that hurt you.. ...are not worth remembering. You forget it too. Forgive him. For Sukh's sake. Forgive him. Yes, Billoo. You spent 25 years waiting for your enemy. Your kin yearned for your love, but you had none to spare for them. Brother. Saint Gurunanak has said.. ...where there's forgiveness, there's love. Where there's love, there's God. 'You've a good sense of humour, Sardar.' 'Why should the child pay for his father's sins?' 'And love stories that don't have an ending, are still love stories. 'But my mother had forgiven you.' I will forgive you on one condition. If you become a permanent member of this family. Brother, will you beat me if I step out? If you leave Sukh, then I will kill you. Sardar. Try smiling sometimes. Billoo. - Yes. On this great occasion, I've thought of names for our children. Happy and Ending. Pammi, you mean Happy Ending. Get the sweets. Someone get me an ice-cream quickly.
