Hi, Dean. Genesis Recovery is a fellowship of men and women o share their experience, strength, and hope with each other, that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism and drug addiction. Is there anyone here tonight that feels the need to drink or use? Go ahead, little sister. Don't be shy. Um, I'm Sherry. I'm an addict. Hi, Sherry. Um, I've got I got clean in prison, and... I feel like using so bad. From the age of 16 to 22, heroin was the love of my life. I mean, I had a daughter, and I never even took care of her, and I want to take care of her, but I got to... stay clean, so I'm just here to stay clean and... That's all I got. Hey, Sherry. Hey. Listen, don't worry about your problems. I mean, you're not alone. Like, me, I could completely relate to what you were saying, because I come from a dysfunctional, alcoholic family. And drugs were part of my entire teenage life. When I was growing up, I knew we weren't supposed to be doing drugs, but everyone was doing them anyway, so I just-- I just fell into that, you know? She's not hearing you, friend. She's got too much on her mind. Do you need a ride home? Okay, thanks. He's right, Andy. I'm sorry. I'll catch up with you tomorrow. Sherry, did you ever work at Tony Martino's joint, the Paradise? I used to cook speed in a warehouse over at South Kearny. Tony was one of my partners. What's your name again? Dean Walker. Dean Walker? I don't know you. Man, I was, like, 16 when I worked there, I think. Tony named me Lolita. That was my stage name because I was so young, Lolita. I had really long hair. Yeah, I remember. You do? You know they closed that place down. Why, too many underage girls? No, it all came down when Richardson got into office. Tony lost all his juice. Where's he at, anyways? Greenhaven. He got busted making a big move in the city last year. They gave him 15 to life. Damn, that's deep. He probably deserved it, though, right? Ugh! Do you know Richie Parks? Richie Parks. No, I don't know him. Who's that? He's another lowlife scumbag. He's also my baby's daddy. He broke out a while ago. I don't know if he's alive or dead. Do you have kids? Oh, yeah. I got three boys and two girls. They all live in Oklahoma with their mamas. Hmm. Do you take care of them? Oh, yeah, I do now. So far away. Yeah. Okay, thanks, man. Good night, little sister. And you take care, all right? And be careful. Bye. I love you too. All right. Okay, bye. What's up? Some fucking real-life bullshit I had to deal with today. Are you done with the phone? Yeah, go ahead. I forgot how it gets, you know. Here I was, thinking prison was the worst; this was gonna be, like, some kind of heaven, but it ain't, you know? I heard that. That job shit got me tight. You all right? Good looking out, girl. Ain't no thing. What are you looking at? Damn, white girl, you are always on the phone. Ests sorda? Hey, Lynette. Hi. How are you? It's Sherry. Is Bobby there? Don't you hear me? Ah-- hey, Bobby, what's up? It's Sherry, yeah. How you doing? Yeah? Cool. Listen, I called to talk to Alexis, actually. Is she there? Why, you think you're something special? What? She's sleeping? Wait. Hold on a second. Get out of my face. Bitch. Uh... Okay, well, I'm gonna call back tomorrow, then, early, because I really want to talk to her, okay? Okay. Okay, Bobby. Bye. Have you got a problem with me? Yeah, I've got a problem with you, bitch. You jealous of me or something? Your mother's a bitch. Oh, my mother's a bitch? My mother's dead, you fucking stupid crackhead. But you turned out good. Look at you. Your daddy's a fucking baby raper. Get the-- Fuck you, you fucking cunt! I'll call the cops! Do you hear me? Fuck you, you fucking toothless cunt! Fuck you, puta! Now that you've both been fucked, you should feel better. I'm telling you, bitch, you don't fuck with me, because I will hurt you. Go to your rooms, now, or I'm calling 911. Go. Sherry, wake up. Oh. What's going on? Sorry. Sorry to show up like this. Bob. Yes, hon? Your sister's here. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? Mommy! Hey. Oh. Hey, Lexi. How you doing, kiddo? Why do you have a garbage bag? A garbage bag? Okay, come on. Let's finish getting ready for camp. I can't stay at that place. It's like being in prison all over again. I know. I know. I hear you. Mm.

But I do need to stay here for a little while. Two weeks. If I stay at that place, I'm gonna violate. I can feel it. Okay. Okay. No drugs in this house, Sherry. You bring drugs in here, and I'm going to call the cops. Bobby, how many times do I got to tell you this? I'm clean. Okay. Promise? Hey, my baby. I'm going to camp now, Sherry. "Sherry"?

Let me see you. No, you got a good figure. You look cute. You think Lexi's gonna get my body? I don't know. I do. That girl is going to be tall and skinny. Watch. I'm gonna look out for her. Want me to do your makeup later? Would you? Sure. Just let me finish this first. I'm going to do your eyes purple to match your pants, okay? And I'll give it to you when I'm done, so you can have it. I never got a professional makeup job before. Thank you. You know, every Friday night in my cell, we'd have ladies' night. We'd put on face masks and wear lingerie and stuff like that. Lingerie in jail. You're really nuts. That's what happens when you got to wear state clothes every day. You didn't go with any girls, did you? No. Some girls in there tried to get with me, but I told them what time it was. Daddy. Sherry Anne. What's that? Hi. How are you? Well, we got into some traffic. Hey, Marcia. Hey, how you doing?

Inpatient or prison; your choice. Ugh! You know, I don't get you. You want to get clean. You don't want to do the work. You want your daughter, but you don't want to do the work. I wish it could be some other way, but at this point, you do not qualify for outpatient. Take the weekend. Say good-bye to your family. Report to me Monday morning at 8:00 a. m. , and I will take you down. If I don't see you, I will issue a warrant for your arrest.

I have to go to the bathroom. You do? Okay, let's go. One more. Come on. Damn it. Go in the bathroom. Jesus Christ. You like embarrassing me like that? Do you? Why don't you answer me? You never listen to me, and you never answer me. Look at me when I talk to you. You want me to leave you here? Is that what you want? You're lucky that I'm here with my girl, or I'd beat the living shit out of you, you fucking bully! Lexis? Lexis, I'm sorry. Lexi, Lexi. Hey, baby. Alexis, what are you doing?

I never asked you this the whole time that I was away. I never asked you... Asked me what, Sherry? Could you help me take care of my daughter? I can't do it by myself. Of course I can. What do you think I've been doing? I know, but I never asked you. Come here. Yes. You're gonna be okay. You want to come inside? No. You think you were worried about Lexi. Dean's probably waiting by the window for his baby. Thanks. Oh, I will free the bird in me,  oh, when I find my life,  what I always knew could be,  oh, when I find my life.
