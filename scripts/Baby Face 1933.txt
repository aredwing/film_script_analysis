I'll give you the 50 cents when I change the buck. Sixty dames. Come on, Nick, what do you say? Come on, Nick, what do you say? Hello, boys. Hello. How's the old woman? Glad to see you. - Come on in, Joe. - Glad to be here. Yeah, sure. Have a good one. - What did you do that for? - Why, I'll give it to you. - Hey, Cliff. - Well, what are you gonna have? - Beer, and hurry it up. - Right. Come on with that beer. Hey, where's Lily? Oh, I'll find her. Oh, Lily. Where is she? - Where'd she go? - I don't know. Now look what you went and done. You're fired. - You lazy, thieving little son of a... - Hey. - Easy with the whip. - You keep out of this. - Go on, get out of my house. - lf Chico goes, I go. - What? - You heard me. Don't you talk to me that way. I'm your father! - That's my tough luck. - Listen... Now get this. If I stay here, Chico stays too. Take some beer out to the boys, will you, Lily? Clean that up, Chico. - Here's Lily! - Lily, how are you? - Hello, Lily. - Thattagirl. What's your hurry? - Some beer here, Lily. - Ain't that funny? - Come here, sweetheart. - Oh, lay off, you big ape. Over here, honey. Give me a bottle of that stuff, will you? I missed you. - Yeah? - Put a head on this, will you? A couple of glasses. Here's looking, Lily. How's things, baby? Let's me and you take a little walk over by the quarry, huh? Come on in, Cragg. - Hey, cobbler, when do I get my shoes? - When you pay for them. - What do you say, do we take a walk? - I can hardly wait. - Hello, Mr. Cragg. - Sit down. - Beer? - Yeah. You ain't been in lately. I don't care for the crowd here. No. They're pretty mangy. How long are you going to stand it? Why don't you get out before it is too late? - Where would I go? - Out into the world. You could make something of yourself. You have power. Yeah. I'm a ball of fire, I am. You don't realize your potentialities. Come again? Did you read that book I gave you? Oh, I tried to, but I didn't understand it very good. It's by Nietzsche, the greatest philosopher of all time. Yeah. Well, I never did get much good out of books. You are a fool. You could learn a lot from that book. But if you are content to stay here like a dumb animal... ...in this miserable life, then I wash my hands from you. - Gee, Mr. Cragg, you ain't sore, are you? - Here. - For the beer. - Oh, no, I couldn't take it. Not from you. No, no. I accept no favors. Oh, don't be like that. You ain't like a customer. - Come in again tomorrow? - Well... ...we'll see. - Did he pay you for it? - Yeah, but I gave it back to him. - Say, what do you think we're running here? - It looks to me like a zoo. Four. Four and a quarter. Four-fifty, 4.75, 5.00. Another cup of coffee, honey? Hello. Well, Ed, I'm glad to see you. Come on in. - It's hot tonight. - Yeah, yeah. Just make yourself comfortable, Ed. - Good night, Nick. - Good night, boys. - Good night, Joe. - See you tomorrow. Yeah, come back tomorrow. I wanna talk to you. You fixed it with the big fella, didn't you? They ain't gonna make no trouble? Yeah, that ain't what I wanna talk to you about. He's a big politician, ain't he? He's a big something, and it ain't a politician. Honey, you makes me tickle. Chico, go downstairs and watch the still while I'm out. Come on, hurry up! Get a move on you. Come on, old-timer, come on. - You and I are gonna take a walk. - What's the matter? Come on. Up. What's the matter? - What's the matter? - That's all right. Come on. - How are you, Lily? - I was great up till now. I don't often get to see you alone. Oh, excuse me. My hand shakes so when I'm around you. You haul your freight out of here. - What, you getting particular? - Maybe I am. - Did you ever take a good look at yourself? - Yeah, you're exclusive, you are. The sweetheart of the night shift. Come on, you're wasting my time. Everybody knows about you. Yeah? Well, you ain't going to. - Ed. What's the matter? - No more protection for you. I'll see that the police close up your joint. Lily! What did you do to him, huh? Are you crazy? Ed Sipple's kept my place open. Now he's going to the police, he's gonna close me up. You done it! You never was any good. Pulling a thing like this, I ought to kill you. - What's stopping you? - I should've thrown you out years ago... ...instead of raising you the way I did! - Yeah, the way you did. - You're just like your mother! - She was lucky to get away from you. Was she? Look what happened to her. She's better dead than living with a thing like you. - And I'm getting out too. - You little tramp, you! Yeah, I'm a tramp, and who's to blame? My father. A swell start you gave me. Ever since I was 14, what's it been? Nothing but men! Dirty, rotten men! And you're lower than any of them! I'll hate you as long as I live! Mr. Powers, there's something wrong with the still. It's smoking something awful. Can I do something for you, honey? Your father's in there! Poor Mr. Powers. What a terrible death. - Nick Powers? - Yes. Well, that's that. I never go to funerals. A relic of barbarism. So now what? Well, the future looks very bright. Just as I was leaving the cemetery, Ed Sipple made me a proposition. And the manager of the Star and Garter Burlesque House... ...offered me a job in the chorus to do a strip act. - A strip act? - Yeah, show my shape. Well, that's a business in itself. Oh, I guess I ain't much of a businesswoman. What's going to become of you? It's up to you to decide. If you stay in this town, you are lost. Where would I go, Paris? I got 4 bucks. That's what makes me mad with you. You're a coward. I mean it. You let life defeat you. You don't fight back. - What chance has a woman got? - More chance than men. A woman, young, beautiful like you... ...can get anything she wants in the world because you have power over men. But you must use men, not let them use you. You must be a master, not a slave. Look. Here. Nietzsche says: "All life, no matter how we idealize it... ...is nothing more, nor less, than exploitation." That's what I'm telling you. Exploit yourself. Go to some big city where you will find opportunities. Use men. Be strong! Defiant! Use men... ...to get the things you want! Yeah. Hey, this is okay. Give me a match. - It's awfully dark in here. - Yeah. Well, the darker the better till we pull out. Well... ...the next station is New York. Hey, you. Come on out of there. Come on. Well, I'm a... Too many of you dames getting away with it these days. - The cops in the yards will take care of you. - Oh, wait a minute. - You wouldn't throw us off, would you? - Yeah, and you're gonna get 30 days for it. - In jail? - Yes, in jail. Now, why don't we sit down and talk this thing over. That lady's dressed up. And look at her automobile. But what I wanna to find out is how did she get them? I could use some of them pork chops. It's all in your mind. You ate yesterday, didn't you? Boy, I'll bet there's plenty of dough in this little shack. Say, I'd like to work in there. Can you fix it for me? You might try the Personnel Department around on 47th. Thanks so much. I'll be seeing you. - Get me a taxi. - Yes, sir. Taxi! - Is this where you ask for jobs? - Yeah, this is where you ask for them. Wait here. I have good references. If I could only see him. You can wait if you want to, but he is out to lunch. What part of the South are you from, Mr. Pratt? Tallapoosa, Georgia. I know some Pratts where I come from. Where was that? Oh, maybe I'll tell you someday when I know you better. - Say, I like it here. How about a job? - Oh, we don't... Oh, now, don't tell me in this great big building there ain't some place for me. Have you had any experience? Plenty. I'd rather wait in there. I hate crowds. Don't you? The boss won't be back for an hour. Well, then why don't we go in and talk this over. - Is that a permanent? - Yeah, they do it for 3.35... ...at Boin's Beauty Shop. - Where's that at? - 81 st and Broadway. - See that this gets off at once. - Yes, sir. - Thought any more about that girl? - No. Mr. Brody, she's smart and... I told you once, I don't need any more girls in my department. - Seventy-nine. - Seventy-nine. One twenty-one. One twenty-one. One twenty-two. I'll be right back. Oh, Mr. McCoy, those papers will be ready in 10 minutes. Oh, thanks very much. - Who's that girl? - That's the girl I've been telling you about. - One twenty-two. - One thirty. One thirty. - Two hundred and fifty-two. - Well... ...maybe I could use her. Well, Mr. Brody, she's very intelligent. She's head and shoulders above any other girl in the place. That so? - Hey, sign this, will you? - Hello, stupid. - Are you married? - No, and I know the next answer: I don't live with my folks. Someday that signature will be worth money. Yeah, they laughed when I sat down to play the piano. This is the Benson mortgage. Will you look it over now? Is the insurance clause here? Everything's incorporated in it. Stick around after 5. Yes, this is a very serious case. I'm afraid we'll have to foreclose. Look at that, will you? Sickening, the way those two carry on. You'd never think he had a wife and three kids. Oh, hello, Jimmy. Listen, Baby Face, how about having dinner tonight? - I got two tickets for Vanities. - Oh, I'd love to, but I can't tonight. Well, I never see you anymore. I never see anybody anymore. I'm working so hard. - Gee, but l... - I'm sorry. I have to go to bed early every night. Excuse me, will you? You don't know you're out till they stop counting. Wake up, kid. Baby Face is moving out of your class. Oh, not here. Somebody might... - Has Mr. Brody left yet? - No, Mr. Stevens, I believe he's still here. Brody. Brody! This is an outrage. A man in your position. Get your check at once. Young woman! We have no place here for a girl of your sort. You're through tonight. Why, Mr. Stevens, it wasn't my fault. He followed me in there. What could I do? He's my boss, and I have to earn my living. Oh, I'm so ashamed. It's the first time anything like that has ever happened to me. Well, I'll... I'll think it over. Report tomorrow as usual. Oh, thank you, Mr. Stevens. Mr. Stevens' office. No, he ain't. I mean, isn't. Thank you. - For Mr. Stevens. - Oh, thanks. Do you think you'll be able to get off in time to go shopping? - I don't... - I'll take this in. He has to sign this voucher anyhow. - Well, she certainly works fast. - It won't do her any good. He's very much in love with the girl he's engaged to. Say, I was surprised to read that in the paper. It's a good match for him too. Marrying old Carter's daughter. Mr. Stevens is an extraordinarily fine person. He has high ideals. He's not like other men. - You can't come in. - What do you mean? New landlady. And she's a terror. Won't let me have any men visitors. - I've gotta see you. It's been over a week. - No, it can't be done. But, Lily, losing my job was bad enough, but not seeing you is worse. I can't stand it. No, it's wrong. My conscience has been bothering me. - But you... - Think of your wife and kids. I can't see you anymore. Lily... - Who was it, honey? - Oh, just a boy collecting for the paper. - Have a drink? - No, thanks. I never touch it. Oh, you don't want me to drink alone. Well... ...maybe just a sip. Hello? Tell Mr. Stevens that his fiance is upstairs with her father... ...and she'll be right down to see him. Thank you. Oh, Miss Merrick, I've changed my mind. Could you go to lunch now? I'd like to get a manicure at 1:00. That's quite all right. Haven't I told you never to come beyond the front of this desk? Oh, but I get so lonesome out there all by myself. Now, don't do that. How do you expect me to get any work done? Hold me close. Anne. Anne, listen to me. Paragraph. It has always been the policy of this institution... ...to appoint its customers... - Father! My darling. What is it? What is it? Anne, please, dear. What? Tell me. Tell me what happened. - Anne, please. - There's nothing he can say. I don't wanna see him. - What happened, Ned? - Why, l... Send him away, please. I can't. Perhaps you'd better wait outside. There seems to be only one thing to do, Ned. Let that girl go. - Is that all to go out? - Listen to this, will you: "When guests enter the dining room... ...it is customary for the butler to hold out the chair of the mistress of the house. If there are footmen enough, the chair of each lady is held for her." See that you don't forget that now. Come in a minute, please. Lily... ...it's too bad that happened. l... I'll have to let you go. Yes. Well, I have no choice. You understand. Anyway, it's better this way. I'd rather you don't work. I don't wanna quit the job. I like to be near you. I don't see you much as it is. Well, I'm sorry, Lily. There's nothing else for me to do. You can't stay here. All right. If I have to go, it means that you won't see me anymore. - Look here. - No, that's all there is to it. If you fire me, we're through. It isn't the job, I don't mind that. But it just goes to show me how much you care. - Well, you know how much l... - How much you what? Are you letting me go? Ned, you can't do this thing. I don't want to hand your resignation to the board. I'm sorry, Mr. Carter, but I can't discharge the girl. - I know it's difficult, but now, look here... - It's no use. I know what you're going to say, but I can't help it. I'm willing to take the consequences. I know it means my job. And Anne will break our engagement. Now, now, take it easy. This needn't be the end of the world. Naturally, you're upset. But after all, you and I understand each other. Suppose you let me handle this thing. What you need is a little change. A few days at White Sulphur. Or even at Atlantic City. That'll give you time to think things over. Meantime, leave everything to me. What do you say, huh? - Thanks a lot. - Yeah. Yes? Thank you. Mr. Carter would like to see you right away. Me? I won't waste words with you. This is a very serious matter. Of course, you realize that Mr. Stevens is engaged to my daughter? Engaged? Why, I had no idea. Oh, it can't be true. You mean, you didn't know he was to be married? Oh, no. He told me I was the only one. My daughter is heartbroken. But what about me? You're not asking me to give him up, are you? Oh, how could I? Did he mean so much to you? Everything in the world. Was he your first sweetheart? This is very distressing. I'm sure you must see how impossible it would be... ...for you to remain at the bank. But what will I do? - Have you no family in New York? - No, I'm all alone here. I haven't any friends and I haven't any money. I shall have to think this over. Will you tell me where you live? My telephone number is Schuyler 3-2215. - Miss Powers? - Yes, sir. Come right in. Thank you. - Good morning. - Oh, good morning. - Is these new furs, honey? - Not so much "honey." Yes, ma'am. Oh, before I forget it, Mr. Carter called up. - He's coming up for dinner. - Yeah? Give the old boy Irish stew. Oh, Hodges, we'll have coffee and liqueurs in here. Did Fuzzy-Wuzzy enjoy his dinner? Oh, you're just too marvelous. Okay, Hodges. Does my baby want brandy? Anything you say. - Aren't you gonna have some? - Oh, no. I never drink. Oh, come on. Well, maybe just a sip of yours. Isn't this cozy? You know, sometimes your little girl gets awful lonesome here all by herself. Oh, my dear. I wish you'd get rid of that fantastic colored girl. - No, Chico stays. - All right, all right, all right. How would you like to have a nice grand piano in this room? Thanks, no pianos. I used to hear one all day long. Why, did somebody in your home play the piano? Anybody that had a nickel. Oh, I was only kidding. Of course, if Fuzzy-Wuzzy really wants to give me something... ...he could put a few more pennies in my bank account. My dear, ask me something difficult. So nice seeing you back at work again. Bye, darling. Schuyler 3-2215. Miss Powers' apartment, please. What? I'm calling Miss Lily Powers' apartment. Well, how long ago? Two weeks? Well, she must have left a forwarding address. - Merry Christmas, Miss Powers. - Thanks. Merry Christmas to you. Oh, thank you. Aren't you going out for Christmas dinner? No. You shouldn't have gave the servants the day off. - I hate to leave you all alone. - Oh, I don't mind. Oh, before I forget, Mr. Carter, he telephoned. Said he'd come in this evening if he could get away from his family. That'll be just dandy. - What's this? - Oh, that? It come while you was out. It's some books from old Mr. Cragg back in Erie. - You run along and have a good time. - I sliced some turkey for you. - It's in the icebox. - Thanks very much. Well. Merry Christmas. I had a terrible time finding you. - Why didn't you leave word? - Wait a minute. You're kind of mixed up, aren't you? I thought you left town. Well, what else could I do? - I was in a... - Jam? Well, I won't let you get in another. See what I mean? Lily, don't do this to me. I can't stand it. - It's been brutal not seeing you. - Yeah? Well, you better get used to it. Listen, I don't owe you a thing. Whatever I do is my own business. You never had but one idea about me. That's all I ever meant to you. - Lily... - You made your choice. Now what do you want? You mean... ...I can't see you anymore? - How did you guess it? I'm sorry my butler's off today. I like to have my guests shown out in style. But, Ned, I have a right to know. You haven't been to see Anne since Christmas. And it's obvious to everyone that you're neglecting your work. - Now, what's the matter? - I'll tell you. Why not? I can't get along without her. She's on my mind all the time. - Who do you mean? - I mean, the girl. I saw her Christmas Day. It's my fault what's happened! I can't stand the thought! Some man is keeping her! But are you sure of that? Feeling the way I do, I have no right to see Anne again. That means I'm through here at the bank. All right, that's all there is to it. It's the sweetest New Year's present I ever got. Sit down. I like to look at you. I'm sorry, Miss Powers is not at home. I told you Miss Powers is not at home. - I know she's here. - I say, look here! Where are you going? What's that? - What do you want? - I want you to come with me. - Now. We're going to be married. - You're drunk. I know what I'm doing. It's the only way. I can't go on without you! So you wanna marry me, huh? Isn't that beautiful. - Get out of here or... - You've got to marry me! If you don't, I'll kill myself. - Stop acting. - No, I mean it! So help me, I'll kill myself! I told you to get out of here. Why, you... There's been an accident here. You'd better call the police. I tell you, gentlemen, not in my 50 years of banking... ...has this institution been implicated in such a scandal. So with a scandal on top of us and a blast of dangerous notoriety... ...that's shaken the people's confidence in our bank, what do you do? You demand the president's resignation... ...and break your necks to elect a new president. A playboy who hasn't had a day's banking experience in his life. How do you expect a society globetrotter to restore confidence? Perhaps you've forgotten that his grandfather founded this bank. In this emergency, the Trenholm name is the greatest asset we could have. Excuse me, sir. Mr. Trenholm is here. He's on his way in, gentlemen. And I needn't remind you how essential it is... ...that we give him our undivided loyalty and support. Good morning. - I hope I haven't kept you waiting. - Mr. Trenholm, my congratulations. - Thank you, sir. - Well, Courtland. I'm delighted to see you, Mr. Vanderleur. Your grandfather would have been proud to see you here. That's very kind of you, sir. - Morning, Courtland. - Hello, Jameson. - Well. - Good morning. Well, I'm glad to see you, Mr. Gault. I... Gentlemen, I shan't take up your time... ...telling you how much I appreciate this honor. Some of you probably thing I should stick to polo and not try to run a bank. But I'm sure that with your help, I can't go very far wrong. Gentlemen, the first thing we have to decide... ...is what we're going to do about this Lily Powers. The Record has offered her $ 10,000 for her story. That must be stopped. The thing to do is to send for the girl. I told her to be here at 10:00. Quite on time. Come in. - Sit here, please. - Thank you. Now, Courtland, will you...? Miss Powers, we understand that one of the newspapers... ...has offered you a sum of money for a story by you... ...touching on this unfortunate affair. - Is that correct? - Yes. May I ask what sort of a story it is? Why, it's my diary. You kept a diary? Well, just my experiences here at the bank. I see. And you're willing to have them published? Oh, I couldn't bear to do it except that I'm desperate. I know what the world thinks. Everyone blames me. No one knows the truth. I was all alone here. No family, no friends. I was working hard, earning my own living. And then... - And then Baby came. - Baby? That's what I always called Mr. Carter. I was a victim of circumstance. No one will ever know what I went through. And then this terrible thing. I couldn't believe it had happened. Now I'm disgraced for the rest of my life. There's nothing left for me to do but to go away... ...where nobody knows me and try and start all over again. I don't wanna sell this story to the papers. I wouldn't hurt anyone for the world. I wish I could tear it up now before anybody reads it, but I can't. I must have money to go away. All I want is a chance to earn an honest living. Gentlemen, I think there's only one thing to do: Give Miss Powers a check for $ 10,000 to turn her story over to us. Oh, it's 15,000. Oh, didn't the paper offer you 10? Yes, but I've been figuring things up... ...and I don't see how I could possibly let it go for less than 15,000. Well, we won't quibble over a few thousand dollars. Are we all agreed, gentlemen? - I agree. - That's the thing to do. - Then we're agreed on that. - Just a moment, please. Miss Powers, no one could help but be moved by your story. It's obvious, as you say, that you were a victim of circumstance. You have our sympathy. Of course, any talk of money must be very distressing to a sensitive person. You've told us how distasteful it would be for you to accept money from a paper. I'm afraid it would be equally distasteful to accept money from the bank. Perhaps we've been somewhat crude in our suggestion. You also told us how hard you had to work. When this thing happened, were you working very hard? Yeah, but not at the bank. Oh, I see. You also told us that all you wanted was a chance to earn an honest living. To get away where nobody knew you and where you could start life over again. That is what you said, isn't it, Miss Powers? Yes, that's what I said. Very well, we'll give you what you want. We'll pay your passage to Paris, and when you arrive there... ...you'll find a position waiting for you in our Paris branch. No doubt, you'll want to change your name. That can all be arranged for you in strict confidence. Is that satisfactory, Miss Powers? - I guess so. - Splendid. - Did you put all that down? - Yes, sir. Arrange transportation for Miss Powers on the first boat sailing. Well, I think that's all, isn't it, gentlemen? Thank you, Miss Powers. You'll like Paris. It's delightful in the springtime. Yeah? You think of everything, don't you? Of course, if I go to Berlin, the food there is very fattening. Well, you could go to Carlsbad afterward and reduce. The very thing! Could you arrange it for me? I'll have the tickets sent to your hotel, Mrs. Hemingway. - Would you care to look this over? - Thank you. You're welcome. Would you look after this, Miss Allen? - Changed your mind about dinner tonight? - I'm still not hungry. - My boy, I think she's crazy about you. - Oh, I don't get her at all. What does she do for a good time? She never goes out. Come on, boys. Try and give the appearance of working, anyhow. We've got to make a good impression on Mr. Trenholm. Oh, dear, I'm so nervous. All this fuss and excitement over Mr. Trenholm. I do hope he doesn't start firing people right and left. The last time the president came... When do you think the loan will be decided? Oh, possibly in about two days. Then I shall take myself to Nice for a much needed rest. Well. I didn't expect to find you here. - I know you didn't. - Miss Allen has done very well. We've put her in charge of our travel bureau. Really? I'm glad to hear it. Oh, by the way, this department has increased its business... ...over 40 percent since the first of the year. - Going my way? - No, thanks. - Well, you don't know which is my way. - Anyhow, I'm not going that way. Well, good night. How are you liking Paris? Oh, it's very nice, except that you can't get a taxi when it rains. Could I drop you? - I'm afraid that would be too much trouble. - No trouble. Thank you. Frankly, I am surprised. Why? I didn't expect you to stick to the job. That's why I stuck. One might imagine that you'd find this business life rather dull. One might imagine that you know practically nothing about me. Still, it would have been easy for you to come here to Paris... ...and have a somewhat gayer time. It would have been too easy. That's what you expected me to do. Does it annoy you to find out that you're wrong about something? Or were you ever wrong before? Well, you must admit that our first meeting was rather formal. Oh, this is as far as I go. So this is where you live, huh? All the charm of the Old World and the Old World plumbing. I'm sure your apartment is attractive. I wouldn't want you to be disappointed. - Thanks so much. Good night. - Good night. Oh, it's one of those pink envelopes. I knew it. These big executives always begin cutting down the office force. Oh, I never thought they'd let you go, though, dearie. - Did they give you a week's notice? - No. Just a few hours. - Darling! - Oh, Aunt Julia. We just few over from London. I saw you dancing with this ravishing creature. This is my aunt, Lady Montroyd. - How do you do, my dear? - How do you do? - Courtland, old boy. - Hello, Harry. Harry simply dragged me here with the delusion... ...that Miss Allen might dance with him. - Do you know the Duke of Pom-plum? Courtland always finds the most devastating girls. But if you get bored, you come along, join us later. Oh, that would be jolly. Well, if I don't see you later, and I don't suppose I shall... ...take me to lunch tomorrow, dear. - I will, Aunt Julia. Good night. Miss Allen, would you honor me with a dance? - Take Harry with you. - I've been looking forward to it. - Come along, you little man. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Well, my evening's a social success. Dukes and ladies. Don't tell me the king of Spain is going to jump out of a pie. You mustn't be snobbish. Beneath their rough exteriors, they really have hearts of platinum. Are you really thinking or just pretending to? That's the nice part of being with a mastermind... ...you do the thinking for both of us. Then you're coming to Deauville? Deauville's too crowded. How about Biarritz? - Not crowded enough. - I'll tell you what. Would you like to motor through the chateau country? And see all those lovely 14th-century ceilings? You're hard to please. No, I'm not, really. Just a little disappointed. Disappointed? - In what? - You. - Why? - Oh, I don't know. I was hoping you wouldn't be like everybody else. Silly of me, wasn't it? Well, I'm disappointed in myself. Because you're beginning to upset me. Darling... ...how long is this going on? Aren't you happy? These have been the three happiest days of my life, but... But what? Well, I don't enjoy saying good night to you every night... ...outside the door of your stateroom. It's funny. - Well, what's funny about it? - Oh, I was just thinking. There's not much difference being on a yacht or on the Albany night boat. You fool, don't you realize I'm in love with you? - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. I can't wait to get back to Paris to buy you all the jewels in Cartier's. To take you to the motor salons, where you can pick out any car that you like. I want to give you a house in Paris and another in New York. There isn't anything in the world I wouldn't give you. - That isn't love. - I'm mad about you, and you know it. There's only one thing I want. Name it, and it's yours. I'd like to have a "Mrs." on my tombstone. I never thought of marriage seriously. It needn't last forever. You could divorce me in two weeks. - Yes, but l... - Oh, it's all right. Forget about it. I just thought I'd mention it. Are you going to miss me? What do you mean? I'm leaving in the morning. Great Scott! Did you see this? This is a fine mess with the condition the bank's in. Hello, hello. This is transatlantic operator number 16 calling lyses 6142, Paris. Hello, hello. Hello, hello. Monsieur Trenholm? Transatlantic operator is calling you from New York. Go ahead, they are ready to talk. Yes? Oh, hello, Mr. Jameson. What? Are you sure? Yes. All right, I'll come immediately. Yes, thank you. I'm sorry, dear, but we've got to go right back to New York. Is anything wrong? I'm afraid so. They want me at the bank. If you'd listened, this wouldn't have happened. Will you stop blaming Trenholm? - It isn't his fault. - When a bank closes... ...because of mismanagement, who is to blame? All of us are to blame. - You can't hold one person responsible. - Rot! You'll see who's held responsible. Courtland. - Mr. Jameson. - Well, Courtland. Hi, special extra here: Trenholm indicted! Hi, paper here! Hi, special extra here! Read all about it. Trenholm indicted! Hi, all about the big bank failure! Hi, special extra here: Trenholm indicted! - Hasn't Mr. Trenholm called yet? - No. Bring me that pigskin case on the bed. - Know what's in this bag? - No. Half a million dollars. Someday I'll have the other half that goes with it. You sure will. You can get anything you put your mind on. What's the matter? The bank's gone. I've been indicted. They released me on a half a million dollars' bail. Bail? But what can they do to you? Why, they're preparing another indictment. I've got to fight it. It'll take money. I've got to raise a million dollars tonight. You'll have to help me. I'll need everything I've given you... ...all your bonds and securities. You have everything here, haven't you? Well, haven't you? I... I can't do it. What do you mean? Lily, you've got to stick with me. You're all I have left. Together we can fight this thing. You've got to help me. No, I... I can't do it. I have to think of myself. I've gone through a lot to get those things. My life has been bitter and hard. I'm not like other women. All the gentleness and kindness in me has been killed. All I've got are those things. Without them, I'd be nothing. I'd have to go back to what I was. No. I won't give them up. Chico, put those things back. Pack your trunks again. We're sailing tonight. Send all my luggage to the French Line pier and get down there as quickly as you can. I don't know, but thank you. I know you've known men before me. Probably more than one. But I don't care. It doesn't make any difference. I love you, and someday I'm going to make you love me. Oh, stop that! Now, be careful. Thank you. - Is Mr. Trenholm still here? - I think so, ma'am. Courtland. Courtland! Courtland! You didn't find him, ma'am? - Maybe he's down in his office. - Oh, take me there. Sometimes they work late, you know. Courtland. Get a doctor, quick. Oh, darling. Darling, don't leave me. I'll do anything for you. Anything. Don't go away from me, please. Oh, I love you so much. I love you. I've never said that before to any man. I never knew what it meant. Oh, darling. You can have everything I've got. I'd do anything for you. Anything. Oh, Courtland. Don't leave me, Courtland! Oh, my God, don't leave me! We've done all we can, lady. He has a good chance. Your case slipped, lady. You better pick it up. It doesn't matter now.
