I'll take it! - Hello. - Hi. That's Karolina, my blessing and soon, my wife. Can one have two wifes in Poland? I'm getting divorced next week. "Paris is worth a Mass". Your wife didn't commit suicide? She's so... fragile. She's a fake. She faked her visits to the analyst, she faked her suicidal thoughts... Hi. Czarek, please pay and let's go. You're developing. Taking new lessons, are we? Do you know Czech? We understand each other without words. I'm sorry, but I've changed my mind. Majka... I wish you all the best, and by the way... you look beautiful. Good luck. Bye. Darling, lets go. You know that after shopping I need to have sex. Sex, of course... Why did you stick with him in the first place. One year of studies down the drain, two years of tears... But the bouquets of flowers he gave you were impressive, I must admit. Forget-me-nots with white feathers... The one with all green flowers was my favorite. Stop it. Kuba! Majka! End your therapy session. We have a full house! We're coming! This one has a concussion. I'm taking him to the hospital. I knew it would finish this way once the penalty was given. At least now we know that Arsenal fans are better in Marshall-Arts. Nutcakes. Well then, sleep well. It's going to be a short one. I've got an exam at 10 am. Some people have all the luck. - Hi, Majka. - Hi. - Need a lift? - No thanks. - Jump in, I'll walk home. - No, really. Thanks. - See you later boys. - Take care. Evenings spent with British football fans are not a waste of time. - Can you hear that? - Aha. Especially when the title of your dissertation is: "Analysis of the colloquial language of British citizens". "Analysis of great agglomerations in England". Whatever. She really does sing well. Yes, but I wonder if the neighbors think the same. Thank you. Dinner is served. Hi girls. What a lovely smell. She has a nose like a police hound. It leads her home exactly at the right moment. Next time I won't even let her look at the food. Just because she did her nails two hours earlier does not mean she can't wash the dishes. When she does finally hook a male, she won't see the end of washing dishes. I told him, that I do the dishes not earlier than on the fifth date. And I don't clean the sink before the wedding. But you jump into bed on the first one. She's going to have a great career. Hello? I've prepared dinner and you're the only guest. I've lit the candles. I'm sorry, but I just ate. Put the candles out. We'll use them another time. Well, that's that. I love you anyway. I love you too. Bye. You know what? You're behaving like a piglet. Piglet? Rather like a common pig! A new guy and we're not informed? Idiots. That was Kuba on the phone. Am I right? No way. A candle-lit dinner with a gay? That's a first. Hi. You're completely fucked-up. You should have taken the flat your grandmother left. What do I need such a large flat for? So that first some chick nestles down, and then twins on my head You could sell it and get yourself a smaller one. With a small wardrobe. This prevents chicks from settling down. The best way to avoid that is to have a lousy bathroom. The most important thing? A faulty gas boiler. The lady wants to wash and experiences a shock: Cold water! I apologize, order a taxi, and sleep alone in my own bed. Bring me some nuts, crisps or... Take it easy, our friend is celebrating his inheritance after his grandmother. - Another round for everyone, okay? - Of course, coming right up. Kuba... - Thanks, Kuba! - You're welcome. If only granny knew... - She wouldn't have kicked the bucket. - My defender. - Kuba, 8 more beers... - No, no... No, enough is enough. I've had enough, you've had enough, please. - Are you saying I'm drunk? - Let me put it this way, we didn't fart around. Have you got a phone? If only someone could tell me where I live... I'll tell you and I'll even make you breakfast. I've suddenly remembered. I'll manage. You're saying I'm drunk? As a lord. I'll stay with these nuts and you go home. Olympics? That much I do after 10 beers. Show us something more. - Surprise us. - Clear the table. That's right, and now I will walk on my hands till the end of the table. - Yeah, right... - A small bet? - Sure. - What's the bet? The bet is... It'll be a surprise. A surprise bet. Here we go. Bye. Hey, hey! I am the victor! Karol? You're all fucked-up. Gentlemen, we're closing. Happy Birthday... One should not suppress negative emotions, and this will certainly allow you to get rid of them, and get back at the son-of-a-bitch at the same time. Thank you. It's fantastic! Go on, say goodbye to your stresses! - Go straight for the heart. - Heart? Darling, you said you were better than my friends? That's true, my darling. So what's the problem? Don't I turn you on? You're the most wonderful woman I have ever met. Just like in those voodoo movies! Do it again! One more time! I'm sorry. I don't know what's happening. I don't think I'm going to make it tonight. And what about last night? And the night before? Go back to your wife. Go on! Unwrap him! Don't be shy, unwrap him! Many happy returns. - Have a nice evening. Good night. - What do you mean "good night"? A ticket to Madonna's concert. And this is my present. The girls were right. Guys over 50 are good for nothing. There's no point in wasting time on impotents. Get lost! But this is my house. You will be happy if you go there. Great fortune and love awaits you. There you will meet someone, with whom you will fall in love, and he will fall in love with you, and - you will live happily ever after. - Majka, don't listen to such crap. Please don't disturb me when I'm working. You will get married, and you will be very happy. But along the way you will have to face many obstacles. The cards say that this is how it will be, and cards never lie, never lie. - But where am I supposed to go? - Majka... - Don't interrupt. - Thank you for your support. - Maybe a small... - Thank you. I don't drink at work. The cards are very precise: The corner of Mickiewicza and Miodowa. On Friday, May the 14th, from 10 am till 7 pm. Tell me what I'm supposed to wear. According to the gypsy tomorrow I'm going to meet the love of my life. Straight jeans, golden sandals, and a t-shirt in flowers. Your a darling. I can always count on you. Majka! I'm sorry. The dress and shoes are at your home. A present from me. I hope you like it. Thanks. The man of your life will be thrilled. Get ready for the barbarian invasion. I'm opening the gates. Do we have to wait much longer? I'm talking to you. She's the reason I lost the bet, right? I didn't know we're on a first name basis. Another inheritance? Enough to give you a tip. Majka. It would be nice if you could remember. Oh, I will... Mala. Asshole. Kuba? 8 beers. What? Nothing. The surprise bet. Well, well... If you have to trust someone on clothes, trust a gay. He must have spent a fortune. Pure give back. I gave him an iPhone for his birthday. Okay, let's see it. Turn around. Beautiful, you look really beautiful. You'd better put it on. The taxi will be here soon. We'll be there before 10. Your hiding something from me. Out with it. We don't know anything. Maybe when we arrive we'll find out something. - Another gypsy with a deck of cards. - Exactly. Good morning ladies. The rest of the way by foot, please. - Gypsies always lie! - Get out of the car! Do you know what it took to get you into the qualification stage? How many paid text messages I had to send? - You lied to me. - I know. But I really think this may change your life. This may prevent you from getting into another fix. Maybe something will happen which will bring back the smile on your face. Do you think that we don't hear your crying each night? Am I really that loud? Guess. Each group sticks to its hostess. Girls, lift your hands up. Can you see them? Yes? Good. You will fill in the form using capital letters... Okay. You wanted well but it turned out as always. Let's go and forget the whole thing. The fine line of ridicule has been crossed. Let's split. Alright. Numbers 620 to 640 to the studio. Follow me, please. Go on, go. We'll keep our fingers crossed. Everything will be fine. You'll see. Profile... Great. Thank you. The remaining girls please do the same. Go. Every girl answers the same questions. The first question: Your interests. - One at a time! - Beginning from the left or right? - Left. - Your left or our left? My left! Please. - You begin. - But, what am I to begin? Begin answering! Answering what? Excuse me, but maybe it's worth repeating the question? What are your interests. ..."Baby" goes first. I'm interested in psychology. Particularly close to my heart are environmental protection issues, and my dream is that mankind be happy and peace reign on Earth. Number 633... ...Baby has qualified. I'm also interested in psychology. We'll get in touch regarding the date of the recording. Am I free to go? No! Baby sits with the rest and leaves with the rest! Understood? Of course, ma'am. Okay. One at a time from the left. Your interests. I'm interested in psychology, and room on Earth... I mean peace on Earth. Number 613... ...qualified. Believe me. It was so stupid that it was even funny. When the director, or producer, told me that I qualified, I sort of... Felt good? Yes. I thought to myself: I'm not that bad after all. But you're fantastic in every way. Beautiful, nice, intelligent. And you can always be counted on. Say that again. I meant every word. You say that because you're my friend. But I love you anyway. I love you also. One more thing... Kuba? How do you intend to solve this problem? If only I knew how. Look. Majka! Hi. Cezary? - Yes. - Read it. - Don't read it. - Why? - I'll delete it. - Oh, okay. Read it. My darling, I know now, that the World was good to me, when I was with you. I know I hurt you, but I will dedicate the rest of my life to make it up to you. I will be waiting in our cafe on Thursday at 4 pm. If you don't turn up, I'm leaving this country for good. Always yours, Cezary. It's a game, you know that? A game to seduce you, again. Why don't you wake up. He wasted two years of your life. And he wasted them in style. He lied, cheated on you, made promises he didn't keep. After two years you were just a shadow of yourself. Let's see who it is. Cezary again. What a surprise. Go on, read it. Read it, send a reply... Do you know what the prize is? I don't and won't know, because I'm not going. Oh? So your giving up? Despite qualifying with flying colors. Yes, and that's enough. I understand and support her. But what if the prize is a trip to another continent? And what if I have to go there with some asshole? If it were me, I would go there even with your psychopath fiance. Stop babbling. One way or the other - I'm not going. Miss Maja Linde? - Yes. - These are for you. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. What beautiful roses. Did he write anything? Is there a letter? - Let me see it. - No! Are you crazy? "Let's not waste time. We have but only one life. I am... I am now sure I want to spend it with you. My biggest mistake was letting you go". Majka? Look. Oh fuck... This is a blow below the belt. Do you think they're real? He doesn't go for imitations. What's his game? He probably just got dumped and now needs to repair his ego. Send it back. Majka, you're not giving in, are you? Remember that night in Vienna, where he was supposed to have a business meeting? You found him in the hotel bar with his arms around some rag. And what about his business trip to Milan? You called him but his wife answered... She told you they were on vacation in Sirmione on the shores of lake Garda, and that you should stop pestering them. Of course, I remember... Check him out. I remember. So you're the lady who phoned when we were on vacation in Italy. - In Sirmione. - Correct. We're planning to go together to Rome, to get married at the Polish Consulate. Dear Lord... Another one. Cezary will never divorce me. He would be left with nothing. All the assets are in my name, so there's nothing to divide. Cezary hasn't got anything. Except a horde of lovers. Do you think I don't know? I've always known. But it's me he returns to each time. I'm sorry. No need to be. In that case this also belongs to you. She should have kept it. Hi. Won't you join us? You look beautiful. I did it! What are you regretting? Illusions. To be honest, I don't regret a thing. I was exceptional, the best, great... Those were just lies. I know, I know... I don't want to talk about it anymore. Is that a stain? That's what you call a loyal customer. No. That's a loaded jerk. And acrobat. I don't want to go. Can't we change the bet? No! You have to feel that you lost. I hate you. But I will face this challenge with the aid of my natural charm and sense of humor. Surprise? Where's the badge with your name? In my pocket. Pin it on. I know my name, you do too, so what's the fuss? I don't recall us being on a first name basis. And vice versa, but you're so direct so I thought it would be fun to close the gap. See ya Kinia. Kinia? Did you hear that? Why are you constantly picking on her? Don't you see who she is? A conceited bugger. This is not an information program, but an entertainment show, right? Just to remind you, this show is going out live. We don't pick our noses, we don't chat with our girlfriends. If one of the participants says something stupid we don't make awkward faces. They are not Nobel prize winners but normal boys and girls, right? So get ready, we're going live in 10 seconds! Turn your eyes here! 10... 9... 8... ...3... 2... 1! Welcome to another edition of Blind Date! A show providing exceptional experiences to millions of viewers and helping our contestants find the other half they've dreamed of. Who today decided to find the love of his life? Let's meet Karol. Tell me why you chose this show to find the love of your life? Be brave! It's just that I'm... shy, and... as a result I'm not lucky in love and I thought that maybe you could help me find the girl of my dreams. He's a cream cake. Don't you see he's making fun? And Majka came here for a philosophy lecture, right? And now let me present our three candidates! Our first candidate: Dominika! Candidate No 2: Majka! Candidate No 3: Klara! And now, question time! Tell me, dear ladies, what do you value most in a man. Klara? He should be well built, sexy, and dress well. Well, that counts me out! Maja? In men I value everything they usually lack, but most of all I don't like conceited snobs who think they're amusing. Who would you want to be in life? I would like to remain who I am, but if you prefer I can say I want to be your footstool. Ladies and gentlemen, I think our Karol... I'm going out. Beautiful, isn't she? Please don't throw up in the bathtub. ...is ready to decide who he wants to spend the evening with. I choose... I choose... number... Number 2, Majka! - You're like the plague. - And you? How about a kiss? Of course. So, where are you taking us? We'll soon find out. Here are two envelopes. - Who is going to draw? - Maybe Majka. Oh no, I don't want to take the blame. Your left with no choice. Be my guest. What can I say. Here goes. Envelope number 1. A luxurious, weekly cruise on a yacht in Nice. I'm being told it's in France. You'll see, she's going to be trouble. No sweat. Are you happy? Very. We're going to have plenty of time to rest from each other. I will give up depilation and... ...petting. Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Karol and Maja! And now we move on to Rafal and Victor. I meant Victoria. They spent a weekend in Kamien Pomorski. You're the reason I ended up here. You distracted me and I lost the bet, and now I have to spend a week with you? Jesus... Why did you choose me? It's not my fault to can't hear when someone is calling you an asshole. What? Is it your overinflated ego or can't you read between the lines? Hey! So long. In front of our very own eyes, our friend, thanks to us, became a popculture megastar. Tomorrow you'll be on the front page of Fakt, Superekspres the day after, and after ending up on the web, you won't even shake hands with us... Karol, I hope that that you'll give her one once you're there. I think she might be offended if he didn't try. She's okay. I mean, she doesn't turn me on, but I can see that she wants me, so I'll be generous and... A gentleman does not refuse. I'm so sorry. It was an accident. We're very sorry. We'll pay for the cleaners, of course. Kuba! Next time be careful. My new trousers! Ruined! - Did you get it? - Yes. Page 2. Majka, not bad! Can someone go instead of you? Search the web and find yourself your own superman. Leave the guys already occupied alone. Let's get one thing straight: He's not her guy. It's just a question of time. Right? What's up? Don't go with him, please. Don't worry, I'm a big girl. I know... - Will you see me off at the airport? - The airport? I got a great job offer in London. The money is great, I can start at once, so I'm flying over. Will we see each other before the flight? - Are you there? - Of course. Please don't go with him. Kuba, have a safe flight. Are you jealous? Sorry, that wasn't too delicate. No comments. You leave as strangers, but shall return as a couple. Are you playing the matchmaker? No. Kuba asked me not to go. I bet he was jealous. He and Damian had a quarrel. Really? That's awesome. So gays also quarrel? I thought only heteros suffered from a relationship crisis. Done! She's here. Baby, what took you so long? You knew we have to shoot your fond hello. You come out of the door to your home... - Good morning. - Good morning... You come out of the door to your home... But I don't live here. We know where you live - zero romance. For the time being, this is your home. Where does she go? Right or left? To the car. Never mind. Karol gets out, you say hello, kissy kissy, that's right, the you get in and drive off. Clear? Ready? Camera! Rolling! Action! Action! Darling... I'm so happy that we're travelling together. Let me help you. Off we go! What a Nenuphar... It's going to be a long week. Oh, I don't know. She seems a natural. The camera likes her. It doesn't like her. "Hello darling, let me help you..." Very amusing. It's a way of getting through this, right? Listen. I won't do a thing to satisfy that TV "conchita". Conchita? We have a week ahead of us. Do you want it to turn sour? We're staying in separate rooms. I intend to sleep and read. That shouldn't bother you, right? I can even help in the sleeping department. Don't tire yourself. I hardly ever get tired. Okay. I give up. When's your birthday? In May. I'll get you a new watch. That was my fourth coffee. Pity it wasn't fresh or hot. - I know I'm late. - That's better. Nice weather, the sea, a meal together. Life can be beautiful, right? I'm beginning to appreciate it. Really? Well? Have you finished proposing? Then get dressed, children. Time to go to work. - What a horrible creature. - I totally agree. Battery loaded? And two spare ones in the car. I want a couple in love, you know. In other words some boring trash. - Got it? - In a flash. Don't try to be funny. I'm the one who cracks intelligent jokes. Understood? In a flash. Wait. Legend has it, that if you throw in a franc, your wish will come true. But I only have Euro. Make a wish. Where did you get them? I just want your wishes to come true. My turn. An old legend? Yes. It's about 3 days old. It was born when I found these old francs in my grandmother's wardrobe. Why? What do you think? This is the real thing. Shall we disappear? What the... - For fuck's sake! - Sorry. Have you lost it? A nut attacks my back, the lovebirds have fled... I said I'm sorry. Where are they? Go. Maybe we'll catch them doing a quickie. Fuck! I could have married a haberdasher instead of getting soaked and living in a villa with a pool. - Fuck! - They're not there. Come on. Don't touch me. - They'll turn up eventually. - Shut up! And these high heels... shit! - Delicious. - I know. Straight from a "cow-goat". I didn't expect to... To have so much fun in my company? True. Want to know a secret? I'm trying my best. This is going to cost you dearly. - What did we do? - What you shouldn't have! We're supposed to have a good time, right? But not at my expense, right? From now on you will do as I tell you. Get moving. Turn that off! Into the car. There's a crisis. Leave it for the poor. Come on. Karol! Where's Karol? I have no idea. Today the lovebirds will perform a romantic dance. I can even dance with the barman. I promise I will be totally romantic. You know you're pushing your luck? You don't know what I'm capable of. Tha station pays for your luxury yacht and the bed you sleep in. The station pays for your drinks... ...and you have to pay out of your own pocket? Do something so that Snow White starts acting as if she were on a date. Observe and admire. Shall we dance? I think we have to. We don't have to. It's up to you. One word and I'm out of here. What about Kinga? And the station which is paying for all of this? You decide. I once had a girl just like you. Same looks, same character. Let me guess. You dumped her? That was my biggest mistake. I let her go. Did you try to remedy things? I fell down on my knees before her. She forgave me... ...and gave me an invitation to her wedding. What a nightmare. Maybe if we leave them alone something will happen. Shit. This is the third day and I've got no material. But the dance came out great. We really do have good stuff. Who's the boss? You or me? If I say the material sucks, then it sucks. Keep your phone switched on! If they end up in one room tonight be ready to catch one of them sneaking out in the morning. What? If you want to shoot ethically clean material, then join Catholic TV. Understood? In a flash. Then scram. Huggy, huggy... May I keep you company on your territory? Avec plsir. Shall I shoot anything else? It's all a load of crap anyway. - Well, I just thought... - Then don't think. You're not good at it. Understood? In a flash. I was finishing my first year of English philology, worked in a pub, started to feel comfortable in Wroclaw, and then I met him. He was 20 years older. He seemed so intelligent, affectionate, caring. He knew how to listen. - He showered me with gifts. - Why didn't you marry him? He has a wife. He was, of course, going to divorce her, but it was all lies. A year of studies down the drain, a year of drugs and therapy... Let's talk about anything except unhappy love. Will you pour me some wine? What? I can't think of anything to talk about. Till tomorrow then. Till tomorrow. It was a nice conversation. - We'll see each other at breakfast? - At breakfast. Good night. - Get ready! - Yes, of course. Hi Stasia. Super. We live on a yacht like millionaires. I've just been to the Spa. Anisa is a superb masseuse. Karol? He thinks he's funny, intelligent. There were flashes of good upbringing. Majka! He can make a charming fool of himself. I thought it was funny. And I you. Bye. Jump into the water, maybe that will clear your mind. Turn it off. So? Was it worth being nice? Get in. He gave me a right talking to, didn't he. I don't know what came over me. When something goes wrong you can always try to make it right. You think so? Thanks. Oh fuck! Shit! The painting's fallen off! A scent of all scents, from the land of Ez. Don't you like it? Kinga showed the cameraman a similar one just a while ago. What's your problem? I'm trying my best, but you're always sulking. You did give your best, that's true. I heard how hard you tried. "Oh Yes, yes..." No, wait. "Yes, yes, yes, oh fuck! That was good!" Congratulations. - Next time don't eavesdrop. - I came to apologize, but that was a mistake. Keep out of my way during the days that are left, okay? Let's play out the remaining scenes of this romantic trash, alright? You think your exceptional? No. That's what you think of yourself. You know what? You are bitchy and conceited. Just because you were dumped doesn't give you the right to treat everyone... Not everyone, but you fall into that elite group of morons. Start shooting our happy departure from this paradise. Okay. Ready? Camera... Rolling! What a pity we have to leave. It was heavenly, wasn't it? Okay? Okay! Got it, thanks. So long. This is for you. You've earned it, Now you'll have a pair. I thought you didn't like him? Oh, you did... A bit. That he slept with her doesn't bother me. But what he said about me was true. Men are never right. Unless they admit to their own mistakes but that's not going to happen, so in general they're never right. - But it's true. - What is? That I treat every man as if he were a rat. What a pig. - Me? I was only joking. - Shut up. Poor Kuba. Don't worry about Kuba, but yourself. - When's the show? - The day after tomorrow. Let the bastard regret what he lost and find out, that he wasn't right. You're to be an angel, do you hear? Although in your case it's highly unlikely, but please make an effort. - Did you see what I saw? - No. What? - Only joking. I saw it. - Damn. Please do not disperse. The show will commence shortly. Please switch your mobile off. Taking pictures and recording is prohibited. Did you ever consider changing your greetings? I don't understand. I know. - Hi. - Hi. Let's get this massacre behind us. I promise you will never see me again in your pub. - Actually I wanted to... - Are you still here? We're going on air in a moment. Get to the studio. - Okay, okay. - Move it! This isn't a Corpus Christie procession! I assume that your stay on a luxury yacht and at a beautifully located Spa resort was abundant not only in cosmetic experiences, so to speak. Yes, it was really... ...super. Have you anything to add, Maja? I will remember this trip a long time. Ladies and gentlemen, it was only a question of time before Karol knocked on the door to Maja's cabin. Time flies... ...and flies... It seems that Karol conquered not only Maja's heart. Any comments? I won't confirm, I won't deny. The rest is silence, as the poet would say. Fucking manipulators! Karol is a real gentleman. A real prick! And do you have anything to add? A couple of words at least. Karol turned out to be a fantastic lover. Kinga, the guardian of our group, found that out herself. The reason she works for this station is obvious. She's to jump into beds of the male participants. Freeze that frame. I'll have her eat those words! I can say one good thing about her. She has a strong voice and her orgasm could be heard around the yacht. Bravo! I am very grateful for being given the chance to take part in this show, to me it was an unforgettable experience. Goodbye. Goodbye. - You went over the line. - And who did the edit? But you told me, that they fucked. Not that you fucked him. Do you believe me or her? What do you think? Oh fuck! The boss! We're screwed. Let's give her a moment. What a slut. She didn't even sleep with him. Maybe she should have. What? Well, if the bitch was so satisfied. It's all her doing. He knew from the start. Of course. What! And she wanted to apologize before the show. Do you want to know what I think? Not really. He should be poked by a hound! But... I would feel sorry for the hound. Here. A mixture of Zen green teas. They help to regain your mental balance. Really? Anything for a lousy love life? That I don't know but scientists are working on it. Great. Shit! Miss Linde... Someone to see you. If you think you can leave the studio during a recording... ...then your mistaken... my dear. And? She was so scared she nearly wet herself. Stupid girl. Let it be a lesson to her. - Your place? - What? Or mine? The nearest bushes? Let's go. What for? Damages for breaking the contract. Harm to the image of the show, the station and the producer. But why? On what grounds? She signed that she agrees to participate and that she accepts the terms of the contract. What about them? She didn't sleep with him. So what. They've got lawyers. She will have to pay anyway. Plus stipulated penalties in case of any delay. The sooner we pay the better. We've got 3800. Anka and Jolka will give a further 1000 each. You know what Anka would say? Quickly find yourself a rich sponsor. You can still auction your Madonna ticket. What? What have you come up with? Flight 643 tomorrow at 12.45. The pay is better, and Kuba will be thrilled. I'll die without you. Now you have an extra 10 coat hangers in the wardrobe. True, that's a good argument to keep on living. Call me as soon as you land. Let's hope the plane doesn't crash. Yesterday I signed my will and testament. You inherit everything. Debts included. Take care. Stasia! What are you doing here? Kuba told me she was flying out to him. I wanted to tell her something. - But... - But what? I saw you both and I just couldn't... She broke your heart too? Too? Can I give you a lift? You didn't answer me. We need to talk. You're very popular. The heart is no servant. Three beers. Coffee and a stroll along the Thames? Will there be anything open? This is London. It never sleeps. Maybe it's the climate, but I would never order fried bacon in Wroclaw. Over here I automatically reach for bacon, eggs, and mushrooms when I'm at the supermarket. You'll start to like it too. Do you miss anyone? Not anymore. So you know about Damian? Yes. I'm sorry, I didn't want to tell you. It's okay. Don't worry. Was he supposed to live alone? There's this... ...old song. I don't remember the melody, but... "Croissants at breakfast we share, all our troubles together we bear". It's a dream come true. Dear Majka. Jola gave me a registered letter addressed to you. She forgot we were not supposed to accept any mail. It was a letter from the TV company so we opened it and found out that someone paid the money. All of it! He gave the name "John Smith". They didn't want to accept an anonymous payment. I asked for more details. They told me he had blond hair. You can return home now. Bye. I got a letter from the TV company. Apparently someone paid the whole amount I was due. Who? A "John Smith". He had to give a name otherwise they wouldn't have accepted the money. Stasia got some details. The description of this Smith matches perfectly. It must have been him. - Meaning? - Isn't it obvious? Karol. He must have felt bad that it's me who has to pay and... ...decided to help you. Exactly. Even you understand. Of course I'll give him back the money, what's important is that I don't owe the TV company anything. But you know what else that means? I've no idea. That Karol isn't that bad after all. - Really? - Yes. Deep down inside I always knew he was a nice guy. You have a very nice butt. How do you know? He replied that he didn't do anything I should thank him for. - Modest guy. - That's true. Now that the debt is paid, will you be going home? No, I'll stay until the end of the summer holidays. Unless you throw me out. Straight into the gutter. Karol is in London for a couple of days. To see you? Maybe to do some shopping, but the sales are over. He's probably here for another reason. Of that I'm sure. Majka, I wanted to tell you earlier, but if you don't do it right away it becomes harder. Okay. Shoot. I'm in love. In love? Great. So I have to move out? Are you blind! Jesus... Tell me the moment I become an obstacle. Everything alright? Come on. I don't want to be late. Fine, but you live together. But have separate lives. We've known each other forever. We've always been there for each other. Are you telling the truth? Are you deaf? Kuba isn't gay, and for the past two tears he's in love with Majka. I paid the money on behalf of Kuba. The poor guy is now totally broke. I even had to chip in my own money. Oh Lord, if only someone loved me that much. Why are you telling us this? Someone finally had to. Stasia... Everything now depends on you. It always does. Just my luck. Girls... If Kuba finds out that... ...I spilled the beans... ...he's going to kill me. You're as good as dead. That must be him. Will you manage on your own? Of course. Hello? Stasia? Hi... Your beautiful, nice, intelligent. And you can always be counted on. The man of your life will be thrilled. Do you miss anyone? Not anymore. I'm in love. In love? Great. Are you blind! "Croissants at breakfast we share, all our troubles together we bear". It's a dream come true. I wanted to thank you once again. That was very noble of you. The money. Yes, of course, I mean... - Forget it. - How can I? I'll repay every penny. So far I have 600 Euro. Just for starters. But these are all your savings... To me it's important. Not only because of the money. What's the other reason? I felt very bad. Because? I got the wrong impression of you. And now things have changed? Your being here... You have a plan, am I right? What about Kinga? What about her? Would you leave her for me? That's what I'm doing. I must get to work. You'll get your money tomorrow. And something more. Here at 2 pm, okay? I'll be here at 1 pm. Kuba! I hope you're not angry that I went alone? I'm never angry. Always good, always polite. A good listener. Your date didn't turn up? No, another guy showed up. A complete jerk and I ended up alone. Don't worry. It means he didn't deserve you. Not bad. Pity you didn't ask if I'm in the mood. Of course. I'm not Karol. Kuba? Have you ever lied to me? The answer to that question is not easy. Fine. I'm not gay. So far so good. What else? How was I to tell you? For 2 years nothing else mattered to you except that Cezary of yours. Tell me what? - Stop pretending. - I really don't know. That I... That I... Jesus, that I... That I fell in love you, that's what. Oh no. I should give you a hiding. You never gave me a chance. The most important one in my life. I'll get Damian a 100 roses. Damian? I love you too. - Look. - Can I go crazy? You can, you can... Majka! The 600 from Majka. You're the one who poured beer over me. It still brings a smile to my face. Hit me if you like. I deserve it. Do you think I'm here because of the money? Congratulations. - I was blind. - As a bat. - And deaf. - As a post. And stupid. But I always loved you. Since we're already friends the hardest part is behind us. Only some details remain. A life together till death us do part, bringing up 3 kids, and enduring your mean character. I love you. And you don't mind that I'm gay? Nobody's perfect. Directed by: Photography: Music: Cast:
