Recruits, today you have earned your place in history. Fortune truly does favor the brave. You have made strong and proved you could stay the course. You have what all men covet... But few will ever know. A bond found only in each other... A brother in arms. I am proud of each and every one of you. You have served your country. You are men of war. You. Let's get moving, people. I want to be out of here by 8:00. She's waking up. It doesn't matter how much you pay people... You can't escape their incompetence. Get some more. I never thought it would be me and you who'd... Make it to the end. You won, Shelly. People died. But the lives we took... We enriched beyond a shadow of a doubt. They'll find you. Who? The police? Who'd believe your crazy story? This never happened. So why don't you just kill me now? We've shared something. We're brothers in arms. If I kill you, it would have all been for nothing. Right, we should have been out of here hours ago. Find her! Next time there'll be no survivors. Is she dead yet? You don't want to do this, Shelly. The money's yours. Take it. This is nothing. Name your price. This isn't you. That's right. We've shared something. There can't ever be a next time. Wait.
