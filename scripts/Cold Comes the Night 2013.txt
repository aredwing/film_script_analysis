I know how to pick up the phone when it rings. You know how to do a lot of things. You are very smart. Smarter than me, definitely. Then why do I have to go to school? I'll make you a deal. This weekend, I'll show you how to use the washing machine. I can help you fold the sheets? Yes, you can. Go finish getting ready for school. Car pool will be here in a second. You're listening to Greene County Public Radio. In today's weather, it's gonna be cold and cloudy. High temperature's gonna reach 30. Overnight low's dipping down to 20. Watch out tonight on some of the roads. Warming tomorrow, but not too much, high around 40. Gonna stay that way for the rest of the week. Lake Festival gets under way Saturday. Hope you can join us. We'll have a booth there... Don't forget to brush your teeth. Hey. Sorry. We fell asleep. Billy said it was fine. Mom, I'm ready. Come on down. She said all right She said all right - Hi, Stella. - Hi. Okay, babe. Let's get this off. Mom, I forgot to feed Mr. Jones. Oh, that's okay, baby. I'll do it. - Denise will pick you up at 3. I love you. - I love you too. - Bye, Stella. - Bye. Thanks, Barb. Shit. The last two times we spoke, I told you a concern had been raised about the suitability of an environment like this for a child as young as... Her name is Sophia. Given the high rate of turnover of a mostly transient, mostly male population. And the local girls. We're leaving but the winters are slow here. There's nothing I can do. Unfortunately it is still unacceptable by the legal standards enforced by the state. What's that? You have two weeks to relocate Sophia to a suitable location. Failure to do so will result in her being removed. What do you mean? This is a commercial property with multiple reports of drug use and prostitution. Your choice to use it as your place of residence cannot... We're leaving, I told you that, but I can't afford it. There's always placement until you get your feet back on the ground. We have families who'd be happy to take Sophia... Could you stop it? These are good families. Would you stop it? Please. It will only... I'd rather be dead. Then you have two weeks. Was dating this chick, and she's Russian, right? And I understand every eighth word, right? Ha-ha-ha. Her dad bought her tits for her, ever heard of something like that? They're big and they're hard, got them done back in the homeland. It was, like, fucking hilarious. Ugh. It's cold, right? My stomach's been eating itself for the last hour. We should probably fill up again anyways. You never know when the next gas station's gonna be out here. That cool, right? Yeah? All right, cool. Mom? Mm? Stella Bradshaw says no one's really supposed to live at a motel. You're supposed to stay one or two nights and then leave and go back to your real house. Stella Bradshaw said that? Yes. How many bathrooms do you think Stella Bradshaw has at her house? I don't know. Maximum two. You know how many bathrooms you have? Twenty-two. More than they have in Buckingham Palace. You know what that makes you? A princess. Mom, you're crazy. Crazy like a fox. I love you, baby. I love you too, Mom. Close your eyes. I wish someone were laying here Here you go. Find everything you need? Yeah, totally. Got somebody to dream about Got somebody to dream about Mother-fuck, it's cold outside. So listen, the thing is, I've been driving for 22 hours straight. I could use a little shut-eye. I have schedule to keep. I know, I know. They do not like to wait. No, no. But we're good. We're real good on time. We got a whole day for the last couple hundred miles. I can see a motel from here. We check in separately. We sleep for four hour, then drive. Cool. Four hour. Four hours, got it. - Hello. - Yes. I would like quiet room for one night, please. Forty-four dollars, please, and you'll need to fill... one of these out. Do you have pen? Yeah, that one works just fine right there. Fill out your name, home address, and your license plate number, please. I walk from diner. Huh? Did you eat? What? Did you eat? It's good there. No. Was it busy? I was hoping for some of that run-off, you know? All right. And I'll need to xerox your ID, please, sir. I will pay cash. Yep, still need your ID. I have a friend who's a cop in town. He's always going on about me xeroxing IDs. So... Well, everybody has job. He was 15 minute late. But I checked and everything was there. Yes, I will cross border first thing in the morning. Jacques, it is a pleasure to be working for your father again. Please thank him for the opp... Give me that pipe. Ow. Motherfucker. Shut the fuck up. You shut the fuck up. - Come on, you dumb bitch. - Ow. Ow! What the...? Get the fuck off me! Ow! Get the fuck off me! Aah! What the fuck's going on up there? What did you do? No, get away! - Get away from me! - I'm sorry! - Hey, everything all right? - The fuck was that? - Hey! - I called the police. Hello? Open up. Somebody call 911. John roughs up Gwen, Gwen slashes John, and John manages to shoot her before bleeding out. You wanna sit here and say, "No, forget it. It couldn't happen." And then... it happens. That's some non-fiction right there, you know? I just saw Gwen this morning. Mm. Hey, how's Sophia doing? Is she okay? Denise got her. She didn't see anything, thank God. That's great. Good. Oh, no, no. Floyd, shit for brains, the Jeep. The Jeep. Fucking idiot. I'm sorry. What? Billy, we have to stop letting the girls use the rooms. Yeah, I mean, you know, it's not like this is ever gonna happen again, Chlo. I mean... Besides, you're not the only one who relies on that cash. I had a woman in from social services today. She told me I got two weeks to get out of my place. If she hears about this, then Sophia's gone tomorrow. Two weeks? Hey. It doesn't matter. Okay? Because you and I, we're gonna get through this. Together. I'm gonna help you, okay? You and me, just like after Vincent died. I'm gonna be there for you. Okay? Yeah? Billy. We have to stop letting the girls use the rooms. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. John Doe and the girl were DOA. Anyone else there? As far as we can tell, he was traveling alone. Sophia? I thought everybody had gone. Ah... Yes, but I believe these are yours, yes? You could have left them in the room, but thank you. Yes, well, uh, sorry, but with all the confusion... Oh. Okay, I see. Okay, one second, please. Thank you. Aah! Unh. Make no sound. Open this door. Open it! There's a hundred bucks in the register, have whatever you want. Quiet. Where is cell phone? I don't have... I don't have it. Do not lie to me again. Okay. Who else live here? Just me and my daughter. Where is she? She's with a friend, they're coming back here any minute. The Jeep that was here last night, where did they take it? What Jeep? The man who was killed by the whore. The police towed his car. Where did they take it? - Do you feel that? - Mom! Hm? Give me your keys. You let the little girl and only the little girl in. Mommy! Or I shoot everyone dead. Okay. Okay. Mom, Mom, the puppy slept in the bed with me. Oh. Was it cozy? Yeah. They're friends for life, I'm sure of that. And, hey, how you feeling, hon? I'm okay. Denise, can you do me a huge favor? Could you take her - for a couple more hours? - No, Mom. Please. Come on. Listen, I'm sorry, I... I got a... I got a double shift in an hour. Then I got Randall coming over as he does with about the frequency of a comet. Denise... Never mind. Any other day. You know I'm good for it. Get the key. Ah. You look after your mom, okay? - Bye. - Bye. Okay, baby, you go upstairs and watch TV while I talk to this man, okay? Who are you? I am friend of your mother's. Upstairs, now. I ask once last time. Where would police take Jeep? If I find out, will you go? You will get me that Jeep, or I will put bullet in your little girl's ear. Hey, Rodney, it's Billy. Okay, so look, I got a '95 white Jeep Cherokee. Yeah. Uh... Seventy-eight thousand miles, give or take. And look... Uh, sorry. Uh, look, man, it's gonna be the same deal. Okay. Wait two weeks, things calm down, they'll think it's going to the heap. I can't do anything less than 1300 on this one. Okay. But hey, man, look, there's no radio. I think somebody picked it before we got to it, so... Billy, it's Chloe again. Will you please call me back? Thank you. He will call me back. And he'll get the car to you clean and easy, I swear it. Where does this Billy live? Ah. Little girl... you have jacket? Of course. Everyone has a jacket. Of course. Please go get yours. Huh? We are all going for drive. Now, follow me. Mommy. You okay back there, baby? Can't we play I Spy? We can play later, I promise, okay? I promise. Fine. I spy with my little eye, something white. Here he is. Go. You won't hurt her? That depend on you. When you come back to car, you come back alone. And if it's Stephanie, tell her to shut up - about the goddamn... - All right. Jesus. Relax. The fuck are you doing here? I need to talk to Billy. What the fuck do you need to talk to Billy for, huh, Chlo? You two don't get enough of each other at that motel? And whatever it is the fuck you do all day. Chlo? I need to talk to you. So talk. Amber, inside. I'm not going anywhere. Shut up and take this. You asshole. And pause it. You can fucking rewind it. What the fuck are you doing here? The Jeep. The Cherokee. One you picked up last night? I know a guy who wants to buy it. It's a good price. I'll take a little cut. I need the cash, Billy. What are you talking about? We know about your deal with Rodney. The guy doesn't just want the parts. It's evidence in an investigation. I can't give that to you. Since when do you care? It's evidence. Soon it'll be paperwork, then it'll be a cube of garbage. Sound like you're on the television. Whatever. I can't help you. So why don't you just...? Just get out, Chlo. You've done enough. Maybe I'll just talk to your chief about it then. About what? Maybe he wants to hear about your bait and switch... Get your hands off me! Goddamn it, Chloe. You gotta be more careful. What did he say? He said no. Do you see it? There's a chain-link fence and police everywhere. Find a way. It's blocked in. I did not need to move it. We need to get inside. Behind stereo, inside, is a package. It will take you no more than two minute of prying. Take it. Now, get out of the car. The sound of the shot will wake your little Sophia. And she will look around because she needs her mother. And she will find her mother, but she will be splattered all over the window and the fucking dashboard and the steering wheel. Now, I'm going to count to five. Trust me when I tell you, if you do not get out of the car, you will not hear me say five. One, two, three... Okay. All right. All right. I'll go. I'm going. Okay. Wake up, little girl. Where's my mom? That is a good question. Do you see her out there? What is she doing? I tell you what. Let us play the I Spy, huh? You tell me what you spy. That's not how you play. It is how I play. You can't just change the rules like that. Yes, I can. Tell me what you see. Fine. Looks like she's trying to get inside a car. Okay. Baby, put your headphones on. It's gone. It's gone. Whatever was in there, somebody got to it before we did. I'm not lying to you. Take us back to motel. Come. I need to know what's gonna happen next. You can at least tell me that. Tomorrow morning, you will talk to your friend Billy, and you will find out who worked on car. What are you doing? I'm guessing no one's getting any sleep, right? I need caffeine, so I'm making tea. Is that all right with you? What was in the package? I was gonna see it anyway. I'm not gonna sit in silence for the next however many hours. As long as you have a gun, I'll be nervous. As long as I'm nervous, I'm gonna talk. Was it drugs or money? It's cash, isn't it? It's a lot, I bet, huh? So, what do they call someone like you? It's a mule, right? I collect packages... and bring them to where they belong. You wanna know what I think? No. I think your employers don't know about your vision problem. Maybe it wasn't so bad for a while, but now you can't hardly see anything. What are you gonna do, right? I mean, there's not much demand for a blind guy whose only skill is killing people. Very perceptive for a motel clerk in this God-forsaken brothel. What if I told you I knew where the money was? We both know where the money was. I mean, where the money is. It sounds to me like you're already fucked. So either you leave empty-handed, wait for the people whose money it is to come, do whatever they're gonna do, which I'm guessing is something really bad. Or maybe... you think about buying some time and taking your half of the money. I see. And the other half, I presume, you think is yours. Hmm. You have no idea how in over your head you are. And you have no idea what it's like to have a child to feed and no place to go. I have been on my own since I was 15 years old, scrambling for cash and nobody gives a fuck. And I'm not gonna do that again, and I'm not gonna do that to my daughter. Little girl, you are being very reckless. So we go tomorrow? And what if I do not care to wait? You can leave here empty-handed. So, you got a name? Topo. I wanna go lie down with my daughter. You were gonna let me use the washing machine. I know, baby. We'll do it next week, okay? Mommy's got something really important to do today. I'm sorry. Okay. Now, tell Denise I'm putting your food in the back, okay? The man in the pictures, he is girl's father? Since when have you been looking at my pictures? So he left you? No, he did not leave me. He was fixing a flat by the side of the road and a truck hit him and didn't stop. He was a good man. I showed up with nothing. Except the baby in your belly. What about you, anyway? You walk alone or something? It's no big deal your partner got shot? He was an idiot. My sister's kid. Jesus. Good help is hard to find. There he is. And? He's got a TV, a big flat one. Give me your phone. It's a burner, isn't it? Guy like you doesn't get a bill with his name on it. Give me your phone. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go. Come on. Get the fuck out of here. I knew it. What? What did he do? What did you say? I said "I know you have the money." He's turning. He's turning. All right, are there cars between you and him? Uh, yeah. Two. Okay, slow down. Keep your distance. But try not to make it look like you are keeping your distance. Well, what does that mean? Don't look so nervous. How do you know I look nervous? Because I can hear it. Shit. Shit! Aah. Shit. What is it? Shit. Aah. What are you doing? He's pulling a U-turn. Did he see you? I don't know. Find place to turn around. Get back on main street. We will catch up to him. It's him. What do I do? Turn off your engine. Turn off your engine. Step out of the goddamn vehicle, Chlo. You let him come to us. I will take care of it. Step out of the goddamn car, Chlo. I'm not gonna say it again. Do not leave the car. Stay in the goddamn car. All right, stop right there. Turn around, Chlo. Turn the fuck around. Good. Now, put your hands on your head. Now, back up slow. Keep coming. Keep coming. Come on. Come on. Keep coming. Now, get on your knees. Drop to your fucking knees, Chloe! Billy. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. What the fuck do you think you're doing following me, Chlo, huh? Spread them. What are you doing? Shut the fuck up and spread your legs. Fuck. Guess what. You're gonna tell me what's going on, understand? You're gonna tell me, or you'll make me choke it out of you, you understand? Huh? You fucking me? You fucking... You think you're fucking shaking me down? After every fucking thing I did for you, Chlo. Huh? - After every fuck... - That is enough. Okay. Okay. Easy. Easy, now. - Hey, easy, easy. Take it easy, man. - Give me that. Easy. It's okay. I mean, who the fuck do we have here now, huh, Chlo? Shut up. Put these on. Mind telling me what is going on here, Chlo? Huh? I was trying to tell you, Billy. He made me follow you. He said that he would kill Sophia. You gotta do what he says, Billy. The guy is crazy. - Okay, pal, look, we can just talk, okay? - Shut fuck up. Huh? Can I do something for you? Hmm? Get up. Time we take drive, yes? You are so fucked. So, Mr. Billy, I give you one last time. Where is the money? I have no idea what you are talking about. Hm. How much was the television set? "The television set"? It was a nickel, pal. Okay? About as much as it costs to go to the movies. Heh. You make joke... because you are nervous. And you should be. A dumb cop like you. You like to take it out and feel it, so you keep it close. Huh? Like in your bedroom? Or maybe under your bed. Am I close? We go to his house. - It's not gonna make any difference. - Shut up. This is it. Is anyone inside? Fuck you, old man. He has a wife. Is your wife home? How am I supposed to know what she does all day? Let us find out. You. Go. If you want your friend to live, you bring money back. What the fuck are you doing in my house? Huh? Fucking lost or something, honey? Who the fuck do you think you are? Get out of fucking car. Billy give you keys to our fucking house? So he can fuck you on our bed? What...? What the fuck did you do, Chlo? Did you find the money? I have it. You fucking bitch! What is it? Why are we stopping? Come on! We need to go back to motel. Policeman should have told us she was inside. You didn't have to kill her. She was out of control. Now, we need to get back to motel to count it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,12,13,14,15,16, 17, 18, 19, 20 bundles including the one you're holding. All hundreds. Not enough for what just happened. You take the cop's gun and you put it where no one will ever find it. Take it. There's a car in the driveway. Hey. What are you doing in my place? Did you find it? Yeah. Wasn't where you said but we got it. What's going on? What are you doing? What does who do? Hey. What, you deaf now too? Half of that is mine. Get your fucking hands off me. Get your hands off. - We're just working here. - Topo! - Get the fuck out of my way! - Let's go. Topo. Topo! Okay, so I say, tomorrow, why don't you come back over and sleep over, okay? Mommy. Call the police. - Come with me. - Mommy. - What's the matter with Mommy? - She's fine. Cops. Just keep driving. Heh. Dumb-asses. How much was in jar? Twenty-three hundred. A little more, I think. You think? Twenty-three and change. Why? How much was off the package? Two thousand exactly. That's good. You want me to count it again? Not necessary. The money has already been counted. That's a crazy-ass bitch back there, huh? Keep your mouth shut. And slow down. You are speeding. Just going back. You say the assailant forced you into Officer Banks' home to retrieve a package from Banks? That's right. Okay, and upon entering Officer Banks' residence, you were attacked by Banks' wife? That's correct. At which point, the assailant fired one shot and killed her. Yes. So in your opinion, was Officer Banks known to your assailant? Excuse me? You think they knew each other? How would they know each other? Did Officer Banks say that? Unfortunately we haven't been able to locate Officer Banks. We found the wife and the radiator where you said he was handcuffed, but by the time we reached the crime scene, he was gone. Any thoughts, any ideas where he might be? No, I... No, I don't know where Officer Banks could be. Think there's a chance he might show up here? Here? Why? He apparently fled the scene of his own wife's homicide, he hasn't resurfaced to make a report. We honestly don't know what's going through his mind right now. Listen, just to be safe, we'll post a cruiser out front of your apartment all night long, all right? Donnie? Black Cadillac. Quebec plates. How many are there? Windows are tinted. Maybe two. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah. There's two. I'm sure. It looks like they want you to come over to them. Right. You alone out here, holmes? You know that I am, Jacques. What's with the glasses? No problems. Besides you being two days late? Circumstances. I took care of it. Oh, you took care of it? You been out of the game too long, you forgot how to talk to your boss. I am sure that if you ask your father... No, dog. I don't gotta ask nobody nothing. Of course. You are right. It will not happen again. Get in. Why? Because Alain is going to count it. The fuck's quoi ca? The fuck's this supposed to be? It is all there. - We were 2000 short... - Two short? Motherfucker, you are way off. I'm sorry? Fuck you are. This package is 50 light, holmes. Check again. I don't need to check again. Where's the fucking rest? Jacques, listen. No, fuck that. I don't need that. I listen all the fuck time. Listen to my mama, my girlfriend too, motherfucker. To my old man who said I should use Topo, that Topo could use the work. And what is with the fucking glasses? I'm gonna count to five, Topolewski. You tell me where you put the rest. One, two, three, four. Hey, baby, how's Denise's? Where are you, Mom? I'm at home. I'm just taking care of a few things. Is the man with the glasses still there? No, no, the man's gone. Why is he gone? Mom? Are you there? Baby, I was thinking... That maybe when I pick you up tomorrow from Denise's that... instead of coming home, maybe we'll... We'll just move. And just leave? You know, even if we move, we'll still have each other, right? But what about Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones can come too. All right, baby. I love you. I love you too. Sleep tight. Good night, Mom. Greene County? Yeah, I think there's been an accident at the gas station on Route 23. Thank you. You know that I did not come alone. You have to leave. There are police watching. There ought to be. But they are not. You stole $50,000 from package. I still have it upstairs, I can get it. Stop! Imagine my surprise when my employers found it out. But you weren't supposed to take it back. You were supposed to keep half. Remember? The plan. Before you knew I took 50 grand, you wrecked my apartment, and you took my money. It was insurance. I was gonna make it right when we split it, and all's you had to do was keep your side of the bargain, but you didn't. You did the wrong... I did the wrong thing. I did the wrong thing. You are afraid. And when you are afraid, you talk too much. Goodbye, Chloe. No. No, please, please. Sophia doesn't have anyone. Please. Sophia doesn't have anyone. Your half. Why are you doing this? Because good help is hard to find. Somebody left a bunch of fucking money here! Somebody very carelessly just left a bunch of fucking money here! I mean, some careless bitch who was stupid enough to lie to me, you just left a bunch of your fucking money here! Hey, hey! Put that fucking phone down. Put your hands up. Put your fucking hands up, Chlo. What the fuck is this, Chlo? It's not what it looks like. Well, hey, do me a fucking favor, keep fucking lying to me. I... Yeah, keep lying to me, I swear to God. Keep doing it. I beg of you! Huh? I mean, where the fu...? Where do you fucking think you're going? You think you're going to fucking Hawaii, huh, after your little boyfriend fucking killed Amber? Billy. You're not gonna shoot me. Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Oh, see? Did you see it? I shot the fuck out of your fucking friends. I mean, I was discharging my fucking weapon all over the place, huh? You see how I did that? I didn't. No? You didn't fucking see that? You fuck. You, you're a... You're a ba... You're a bad person, Chlo. You're a bad person. You are... You're a mother and you're a bad person. You're a fucking liar, an accomplice, you're a murderer. And you... You could have been Mrs. Billy Banks, huh? Where are you fucking going, Chlo? Huh? I'm leaving. Can I...? Can I come? Please. Just you and me. I mean, all you have to do is say yes, you know? See what you...? You see what you...? You see what you fucking just did? Why do you always fucking tease, you? Why...? Why did you make love to me all those fucking times if you didn't even mean it? Why did you do that? Why did you fucking do this to me, Chlo? I'm fucking sorry, Billy! I'm fucking sorry! I'm sorry! Okay, well... I... I know there's more money. And I know that you know where it is so tell me where the fuck the rest of the money is right now, Chlo. Come here. Come here, show me. Show me. Yeah, come here, show me. Don't fucking worry, Chlo. I'm not gonna fucking touch you. Huh? Is this it? I should have seen it coming, you know? Using me just like... Just like you used Vincent. Yeah, just like you probably used those two guys over there. Why did you do it, Chlo? Why did you do it? Why did you do it? Stop. Stop. Come on. Come on, Chlo. Come on. Why did you do this to us? Why...? So you think Billy had been dealing with these people for a while? Yeah, yeah, I'd say that Officer Banks got in way over his head. Sure you don't want to come down to the station, talk to someone? I'm anxious to see my daughter. Of course you are. You two got a place to go to, right? Yeah. We're okay. Thank you. Listen, one other thing. We found this roll of cash. It was $2300, mostly small bills, 5s, 10s, that kind of thing. It didn't match the other money. I thought it might be yours? No, sir. Mom! Baby? Baby. Oh, baby. Mm. Oh, you washed your hair? Mm-hm. You okay? I'm fine. So, baby, you know what I was thinking? No. I was thinking about what Stella Bradshaw said. And I think maybe she's right. Maybe people aren't supposed to live in motels. Mom. You're crazy. Mm. I know. You can travel all around Or you can come away With me Walk the old way, way, way Way, way, way, oh Wrap me in your blankets Dance me around Take me back To where my heart belongs Qu'Appelle Valley Oh, Saskatchewan Wrap me in your blankets Dance me around Take me back To where my heart belongs Qu'Appelle Valley Oh, Saskatchewan Qu'Appelle Valley Oh, Saskatchewan
