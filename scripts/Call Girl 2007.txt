Pull down your trousers. - Pull them down, now! - Yes, mistress. And don't you dare come on my boots. They're new - Does that hurt? - Yes, mistress. - Hi. - Hello. Amazing. You're never late. - Champagne? - Of course. What? Yeah. No, I'm awake. Talk to me, Neves... What? You're kidding?! He's in his apartment?! Great! Ok. I'll be there in ten, ok. See ya. Don't worry, son Momma's coming! Momma's here. Don't worry, my love. There... there... You'll be better in no time. Take deep breaths, my love. That's it. That's it, honey. All's better. All's better. Police! Sorry about that. Didn't hear you ring. I was sleeping... So you usually sleep in jeans and a tie, do you? No, I fell asleep on the couch. Got a plane to catch? At what time is your flight? I can call my lawyer, can't I? It's my right. Do you know how much do those bastards charge? - Especially for over-time? - Yes, yes I do. I'm not sure of his number. I need to get my cell phone. Easy there. Wait a second. Wait there. Wait. - Relax, sit there and relax! - Don't touch me, all right? I'll go get it, relax. Just tell me where the cell phone is. In my bedroom. Go through the entrance and turn on the hallway. - Over there? - Yes. First door on your left. What's the model? - What are you talking about? - Your phone. Is it a new model, with a camera, Internet and all that kind of shit? It's a Nokia, brand new. Uau, that's amazing. I'm not crazy about cell phones myself... Wanna know why? Being a cop, it kinda messes with you head, you know? They put chips and shit like that in it. It has a name... it's called... - GPS, as I'm sure you know. - GPS, that's it. So you know that the GPS that's inside your brand new Nokia, let's us know where you are at all times, right? You wanna ask me something, go ahead. I've nothing to hide, you understand that? Everybody has something to hide, Andrade. Everybody lies. Everybody. Even children. They start young... Wanna know what I want? Do you? My cell phone to speak to my lawyer. Do you understand that? We found your skin under her fingernails, Andrade She was my wife. It happened. She was my wife and she lied to me. You'll see what happens when someone lies to you... You... are... fucked. You're so fucked... man! You disgust me! All right, let's get walking, come on. Let's go! Fuck! What the fuck did you do? Dear friends... This house will be... a space of living memories. A space of well being, of joy, and above all, my dear friends, a space of communion. And I believe so much in this project that my father, who's right over there, my own father whom I admire so much, will be one of the first guests in this house. You should be ashamed, leaving the ghost of your father behind. He doesn't even talk anymore, poor thing. - Take it easy, Jacinto. - Calm down. In this house, not even the pastry is worth a damn. - Calm down, Jacinto. - The hell with you! This house... It's a hole where they hide us to die... Let him be... Calm down, calm down, calm down... Gentleman, please, calm down. He has a right to speak. It's his house too. It's not mine, it's not the councilmen's. It belongs to all of us. He acquired that right, him and everyone like him who fought for our freedom and allowed us to think and speak of everything we want. Let me finish by saying... that this project will only be finished, to me, when we have our hospital. And I solemnly swear... that I will not rest until that promise is kept. Well said. So... Congratulations. You have a talent for public speaking. Thank you. - I'm sorry but I don't think I... - Mouros, Rui Mouros. Nice to meet you. Carlos Meireles. What brings you around here? It seems that most people who pass by are usually on their way to Algarve. I have this fascination with secondary roads... ...and a problem with the engine. Well, if I can be of use... Maybe we'll find you a mechanic. Everybody knows each other around here. Everybody knows you, Mr President... No, thanks... I quit. You know, at my age... If I may interrupt, you never really quit an addiction... you just change it for something else. If I can be of help, Mr. Mouros... Forget the formalities... In this case, without false modesties, I'm the one who can be useful. From what I heard you say before, you need a Hospital. Very well, I'm sure that can be arranged. I'm having lunch with the Minister of Health on Saturday. Why don't you join us? Since you're spending the weekend in Lisbon... How do you know that? And what makes you think that I need your help? No man is an island, Mr President. Might as well have dinner of Friday, right? - I'll take care of everithing with Paula. - You also know my secretary's name? - Hello? - Hi! - Hi! - I'm waiting for you, you know? - I'll be an extra night in Lisbon... - Wonderful... Did something happen? I'll explain later. Did or did you not walked into a suspect's apartment before 7 a. M? What are you, a rookie? He wanted to press charges. - He claims you hit him. - That's not true. I'm sick of your quest for truth! I need a hard evidence, who sent what, what's written down. Stuff you can duplicate in court. Don't you know that? - Can I say something, Boss? - You can't say a fucking thing. I don't even wanna look at you anymore. There's a case in Alentejo. In the middle of some farms, heat, where cows shit. All you need is a note pad and a pen. I've spoken to Neves. He's got the file. Get lost! What, a soon to be dead woman who wants to confess? Great, thanks. You don't really need a cop, do you? A secretary would do the job... That's a lovely dress... - Is it new? - No. Look who's here. 'Dirty Harry'. Do you really need to fuck up all the time? Where you there? Why are you being smart if you weren't even there? - Can we ignore your job for a second? - Sorry. These guys get on my fucking nerves. Why do you insist on having lunch at a restaurant filled with cops? Luisa, I'm just taking things of my chest. Ok, there. Anyway, moving along. What was it that I wanted to ask? Yes, Joo, how is he? You're a hypocrite! I'm asking about Joo. What else do you want? Yesterday at 6 a. M. I was alone in the middle of the street, waiting for a cab. The kid couldn't breathe. Do you have any idea what's it like? No, you don't. You only think of yourself. Even with these shitty attempts of proving otherwise. Let go of me! And do you know what he was worried about? If he was sick, he couldn't go the match on Sunday with you, like you promised. This is worse than nothing, Vasco. And I won't let the kid grow founder of you. This was the real reason you wanted to talk to me, right? With urgency. You're gonna save the world. And the rest of us are just collateral damages. Welcome, Mr. Mouros. Sit down, please. - You saw him? - Yeah, I saw him. - And you know what to do? - I always know what to do. Do you? We already tried money. But the man is sentimental. His family lived of those trees for decades. Cork paid for his college. You sound desperate. We're businessmen. We can't afford to be desperate. So, whatever the cost... We need Meireles's signature. That land is perfect for our Company's Project. Location, access, dimension, water. Midway between Lisbon and the Algarve. Close to Spain... So... What I want to know is... What are you going to do. To bring the man to our side? Well, he quit smoking. What does that mean? That he wants to live longer and better, enjoy life. So, I'll give him the best that life has to offer. You have five new messages... Received today, at ten... fifty... am. Hi Cathy, It's me Thomas. Listen, I'll be in Lisbon next month, so cancel everything for July seven, ok? And listen, it will be really nice if you could bring someone with you. Someone new, who has not been around so much. Someone "fresh". We know what I mean, ciao. Received at eleven... six... am... I hope I'm speaking to Diana. A mutual friend gave me your phone number. Joo Oliveira, do you know? I would like to speak to you... I'll call back, sorry. Received today, at eleven... fourteen... It's Mouros. I've got a job for you. I want you to be available for dinner on Friday... and for whatever it follows... Cancel everything you have scheduled because what I got for you baby, is enough to retire! - Thank God for these moments. - You bet! I envy you, you know? - How's that? - You're a widow. Always complaining. Instead of one, you have two. One here, the other in Lisbon Why do you provide for Amlia? Can you tell me that? - Amlia is for fucking. - How about Odete? She's for fucking with my patience. Watch... Just watch... - Tell me later how fat you are. - Hello, my love. And you call yourself a caring father! Haven't you noticed your daughter has put on her braces?! Oh, right. Come here. Beautiful! Come here, my love. 2500 Euros. This man thinks we can live with his wages as Mayor. If it wasn't for my shop, how would his son be studying in London? By the way, what's with all the shirts? Don't tell me you're going to Lisbon for the weekend again?! Someone got me a meeting with the Minister of Health. - Maybe we'll get the Hospital sooner. - Yes, sir. Quite the life. And, as usual, I'll stay here, selling clothes. While Mr President here is having fun in Lisbon! - Can't stand the smell. I'm going inside. - Go on, honey. Go on... Menopause! By the way Did you get that for me? Want one? - Why? You don't need it? - I don't fuck. Hey, Neves... I wouldn't give this to a dog, man. And I fucking hate dogs. And they give us five Euros per lunch... Fuck this. Look, just because you fucked things up with Lusa, that's no reason to be busting my balls... Are you always like that with women? I bet there was one, once, who fucked you up properly. Now you said it. And I'm not busting your fucking balls, baldy... I want more, that's all. I want a big fish. Something that makes a difference, not this bullshit. We look like priests listening to some broad's confession. Gomes is right, you know? With all that adrenaline, you're lucky to be playing for the good guys. The bad ones are usually fuckers like you, - born on the wrong side of the street. - Catch this, princess! I'll pass by, leave my bag but there's that dinner I told you about... - What time will you be back? - Couple of hours... I really wanted for us to have dinner together. Baby, so did I, but you know how politicians are. They only give you a sausage if you give them the pig first. - I'll wait for you. - Great. - Hey, still there? - Yes. - Wear that black underwear. - I thought you liked me in red. - No. The black one. Wait for me, ok? - Sure. Big kiss. No. This one, thanks. This one. You need to look like a lady. All right, let's go over the script for the dinner. Much better. Do it again, Vickie. - Vickie!? - Yes, that's gonna be your name, Vickie. Go on, do it again! Good evening, Mr President. No, no, no. More Marilyn Monroe. Happy Birthday, Mr President. Happy Birthday, Mr President. Then, after that cheap joke of yours, I say "His problem is that I'm not for sale! Missed a line. Don't worry, honey. I don't miss. You should know that by now. Only for tonight. You haven't earned it yet. It's gorgeous! But, my clients usually pay in advance. Right, but I'm not a client. I don't even understand what they see in you. Keep going... I'll go to the bathroom, give you five minutes alone and then I call you. And when you're alone with him and the guy ask"what do you do?". Your answer is? Everything... Sorry, I'm late. - I brought a friend, Vickie. I hope... - Good evening, Mr President. - How are you? - Hello, how are you? Thanks. So, Mr President, I hope you like Chinesefood. I was there, I saw it. Joseph killed Henrich... and cut his body with a chainsaw. Then burn it in an oven of... "brot". - A what oven? - Bread. He was crazy on drugs. Insane. Henrich's 'frau' was screaming. Joseph locked the dogs in the basement with Henrich's frau. Two days. Killed her too. Cut and burn the body. Buried in the same place. I saw it. But what place... Look, where were the bodies buried? By the camp's oven. Jesus, I just love hospitals. So, what do we do? Nothing to it. Call the local police for them to look for the bodies. If they're there, find the guy and send him to Lisbon. Meanwhile, I'll talk to forensics. Mein Kampf ist jetzt mit Gott What did she say? She wants to die in peace with God. It is: Lisbon/Montijo - Montijo/Lisbon and that's it... Excuse me... - Mr President! - Oh, it's for me. Thank you so much. Ok... this is... well... - Do you mind if I choose for you? - No, no, I apreciate it. Because I can see you're not sure... This one. This one is perfect for you. Thank you. A "Robusto". It has strength... and character. You know, Mr Meireles... That's how I imagine you. Strong... Sensual... Possessive. I'm I wrong? Well, I... - Excuse me, can I give you an advice? - Sure. When a woman like Vickie asks you a question, always answer yes. As if it was an order from God. Because Vickie is the woman God would like to have. If he was rich. Rui never misses the chance to embarrass me. Even if he has to be rude. The problem is, I'm not for sale, honey... Not to God and not to you. Now, I have to go to the girl's room. If you excuse me. Watch your back with him... Remember, there's no such thing as a free dinner! - Fantastic, isn't she? - Yes. But there's something that I still don't understand. I think it's time for you to tell me what you want from me. You're right. I'll be straight forward. I represent people you already know. Investors who are still interested in Herdade da Fazenda. Thank you. That project implies cutting down several Cork Oaks, and that for me is just unthinkable. Can I ask you something? Your son is in London, studying hotel management, which means an investment on the possibilities of tourism. Yes, but... That's not a question, is it? The question is, have you noticed your town is dying? Our project will bring new blood, fresh air, work opportunities, quality of life. And you, my friend, you don't want it. I can get you a Hospital, tomorrow if I have to. But you'll rather stand your ground. And I know you love Vila Nova. Do you understand now why I'm confused? I don't think you understand. - I made promises to my people. - What are we talking about? A few fallen Cork Oaks? The goverment will give us permission. All we did is your City Hall's licence. And we guarantee the plantation of the double of trees that fall to the ground We're not talking about half a dozen Cork Oaks. I know that project in detail. We're talking about thousands of trees. I see that you're a city man, you don't understand about these things. Let me tell you something. Those trees take forty years before they produce cork. Forty years! But a lot of them are at their end. Like those old men at the Home you opened a couple of days ago. Well, let's put it this way. In this land, we don't draw our municipal plans with a pencil. And nobody, is going to talk me into cutting thousands of those trees, so a couple of high class gentleman can practice their swings for amusement. If you think progress is what they did to Algarve, don't ever count on me. Ever. What? Did I say something funny? No, no. It's just realized why you won four elections in a row. Damn phone. Sorry about that Yes. Hello. What? When? Now? No, I can't now... What? That's not possible... All right. Ok, I'm on my way out. No, no. Please stay. I, unfortunaly, have to go. Affairs that demand my presence or, in this case, my absence. But the meeting with the Minister tomorrow still stands. I won't be there but everything is in place. What, you think is still worth it? How do they usually say? Everything is worth as long as your soul is in it, right? The truth is I like you. And don't worry about anything. It's paid for. Oh, I love the tie. Where did Rui go? Rui, he... He had to go. Really! Money can't buy you manners, can it? But you, Mr Meireles, are a gentleman, aren't you? You'll keep me company. Of course! Yes, of course. What did you say your first name was? I don't even remember how long ago did someone... someone asked me my first name. Carlos. Carlos Meireles. I believe it's important to know... when... when we feel close to someone, as in this moment. Don't you agree? Yes, yes. Of course I do. Let me just ask you one thing... What do you do? Everything... Wait... Easy! - I want you to forget about everything. - Yes... - Meetings, lunches at your in-laws house. - Yes... Yes... Official business. Everything. - All that exists right now is us. - Yes... Us... - Can you feel how wet I am? - I do... - Do you know what I'm going to do? - No. I'm going to take care of you. And then I'm gonna let you fuck me. And I'll come for you. - That's what you want, isn't it? - Yes... - That I'll come for you? - Yes, yes it is... I never met anyone like you Do you know why? Because there's no one else like me. I'm an exclusive. Has a women ever masturbated for you to watch? No No? See how hot you make me? I'm losing my mind... I'll do anything you... I can't wait for you to fuck me... Enjoyed the show? Never saw a guy come so fast. The man is like a teenager with a mustache. How's kissing someone with a mustache? - Don't know. You tell me... You're so funny... See this as a first installment. Next time I'll have it wrapped, so you'll think it's from someone who likes you. Chantum cut, some fifteen carats? - Twenty. - Twenty! Thirty thousand bucks at Tiffany's? "Good Morning, Mr. President. " This guy is going to go crazy looking for you. He's going to call me asking for your number. Probably has to get some nerve to do it and call only tomorrow. So, I want you to be available at any time for the next couple of days. Make yourself difficult, earn his trust, and make him spend a lot. Show him that his money makes you as horny as if he was David Beckham. Yeah sweetie... But that was not our arrangement. - I've got my regulars, I'm not going... - Get rid of them! I'm paying you more than you get in a year of small time fucking. I'm talking about five figures, at least, less the money you're gonna suck him. But you have the pictures already... Why you don't just push him against the wall? No... He must do it on his own. Be confident. There's a big difference between blackmail and bribery. Those who get bribed become accomplices and usually don't file complains... Honey, I'm trying to help you. Because I'm your friend. Think about it as a kind of upgrade. From whore to politician's mistress. Diamonds are forever, but you, someday you're going to be old. And don't forget that every single minute a new girl is born. More beautiful and a better fuck. Someday you're going to look at yourself in the mirror and realize that there's nothing sadder that an old whore. Motherfucker. We're are the same, honey... We have no scruples, no soul, no moral... - and we don't believe in God. - Who told you I don't believe in God? We know that God doesn't exist. And you know why? Because if He existed... He would be incompetent. What we are is the next step of human evolution. - And what do I say to my clients? - Tell them to go fuck themselves. Quite the business night, han? Out selling Vila Nova? It's just that something come up... Something come up? Son of a bitch. You leave your bags here and you don't even show up? - What do you think this is, a hostel? - Amlia, I... - Don't touch me! - Listen to me. Calm down. We'll talk later, all right? I can't stay. There's this meeting. - I spend a week waiting and for what? - Amlia, calm down. If you don't fuck me anymore, you should go. Fuck me or leave. - Amlia, listen to me. - Fuck me or leave... This is why I'm happy you never quit massaging... It's not like you need it. You're so relaxed... Speaking of which, how busy are you there days? I just won this huge account that's going to demand a lot of my time. Is there any way that I can send you a couple of my regular clients? What? Nothing... It's just that... there's this client who... He says he wants to take care of me. And he doesn't want me to be with anyone else, you see? He has money. All done. Don't be upset, Maria. I know how much you helped me when I needed most. If you hadn't started me on the job, I would be still living in that horrible hostel with no windows. But it's enough. Do you understand? Two years of this is enough. Do you remember the three rules I told you about when you had your first client? Never accept a drink that I don't see being served. Always leave the door unlocked. And don't keep anything in my wallet that can identify me. There's one more. Which one? Never fall in love with a client. And, above all, never let a client fall for you. Because, one day... He's going to realize that he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life with a woman who blew guys off for 50 Euros. And those people, those who say they love us, are always the ones who hurt us the most. Water... Ok, yeah, yeah Unbelievable! Ok, ok. Yeah, yeah, yeah... We have him right here and try to make him talk some more... Ok, thanks. What? - You're not going to believe this. - Try me. They found a third body along with the other two. - Get the fuck out of here. - I'm serious. And the Coroner already has an ID. Joo Gonalves, a former councilman for the environment in that shitty town. His wife reported him missing about six months ago. What? And he didn't even bother burying the bodies in different locations? Fucking lazy bastard, isn't he? There's more. They found the poor guy's wallet at this motherfucker's house. And stashed in a drawer, were over 10.000 Euros in cash, some smack, cannabis and cocaine. You know what? This is warming up. It's getting interesting. - Are you ok by yourself? - I'm not by myself, she's there. I'll make a couple of phone calls, maybe I'll come up with something else, ok? Impressive. We know everything, man. Are you confessing or what? So now you kill politicians? What's that about? Nothing. Same as others. No. No. Not 'same as others'. This one is different. This one is a politician. Why did you kill him? God's will. God's will? You're kidding me, right? Listen to me, just listen. If you don't talk, I'll find out. And if I find out, you're fucked. You'll be so fucked, you fucking junkie. I'm going to ask you again. Why did you kill him? Who paid you? God knows. Oh, fuck me! Neves? Vasco, come on! Thanks. Sorry about the mess, but ever since Joo's gone... Things haven't been easy. How can I help you? Your husband's missing case file was just reopened, and we want to ask you a couple of questions. - I told everything to the local police. - Yes, but you haven't told us. Joo was suspicious about corruption at city hall. He was going to report them. Did you two get along? That's all lies. Joo didn't run away with no mistress. This people, this town, they're the worst. Want anything to drink? Water's fine, thanks. - You haven't been waiting for long? - Minister, how are you? - You drink? - I'll have... Champagne. Get us two flutes and bring them to the table, please. Let's go in, I still have three lunches to go to today. The thing about golf: It really opens the appetite. And if you're not careful... Do you like golf? Well, I mean... Golf is the best way to keep in shape! And excellent to clear you mind, believe me! For all I know, you have a chance to have a green right at your door! But it seems that you're more interested in that Hospital. At our age, we tend to worry about heart problems, right? And the damn prostate... Hello, how are you? Mr Architect! But you know what I say? I'll rather drive to golf than go by ambulance to the Hospital! How are you? So, talk to me. Minister... Do you know how many hospitals I had to close last year? Fifteen! How do you expect me to give the funds to build a new one? But it seems you're lucky. There's this company interested in financing a private hospital, and that way, it's nobody's business! Their project will bring thousands of people to your region, so the Government will have no problems giving the licenses. And, just between me and you, Meireles, they are friendly people willing to invest considerably in Portugal. Do you follow? And all they want is some land, isn't it? But I've heard you're holding on to some Cork Oaks, right? Tell me about that! - Well, Minister... - Why don't we order first? It feels I have a kitten inside of me. Sure... Joo suspected that the Mayor was doing favors for money. How do you think he paid for his campaign? And the ones that built the Home are the same who built his swimming pool. - Is that all? - No. Joo also told me about this company. That's building a luxury hotel. In protected land. - With golf and that kind of things. - What company is that? I think it's called Herdade da Fazenda. That's it, Herdade da Fazenda. Joo was against it. That's why they got rid of them. Here's my card. Any problem, don't hesitate to call us, ok? Cell phone is in the back. Didn't your husband have documents, anything to support those accusations? I don't know. He had suspicions and it was a lot of money. That's why they killed him. How come you're so sure he was murdered? I've told you. He was willing to talk. And I've been threatened, calls in the middle of night. Sometimes, I wake up and fell there's someone in the house. Are you going to help me? If they find out I've been talking... Herdade da Fazenda? But that's a closed file. I even thought they've given up! So did I! - But our answer is still the same, right? - Sure, of course. Anyway, we'll talk about that later. - Are you free for lunch on Sunday? - Yeah. We'll devour a stew at Pata Negra, just the two of us. - Done. - Bye. - Mr President? Hello. - Hello, Alice, how are you? One more. Any news from your son? Still trying to make a living in Lisbon, but it isn't easy. Young men always find a way. What brings you around here? I wanted to thank you for putting tar on the road by my house. - No problem at all, Alice. - I brought you some sausages. Alice, one day I'll get mad of you, you hear? I'll just take it because I don't want to offend. Give us a kiss. Bye. - Thank you so much. - Go on, bye - Good afternoon. - Goodbye, Alice. - Paula, this is for you. - Thank you so much, Mr President. Hold my calls and don't let anybody in, all right? Don't worry, Mr President. Don't forget, your father's birthday is later today. Oh, that's right, my father's birthday. - I need more time, to study the facts. - Sure. I asked for the reports, but I'm not making any promises. - See about that. - No promises. I trust you. But Mouros, there is another reason for this call. That night we were together with that friend of yours... - Vickie? - Vickie, that's right. I don't have her contact and I wanted to thank her. She was so friendly. She said she was going to call you. She said she was going to... Great, that's great. She's very friendly. But, if you don't mind giving me her number... Wait a second, just a moment. Paula? Here it is, I have it. - Go on, go on. - Ok, 96... Yeah? - Boss? - Get the fuck out, I'm late. - There's a surprise, Boss... - Great, I hate surprises. There's an extra body than expected. - Two minutes to start making sense. - Counting. We found the body of a local councilman who was missing for some months. His wife doesn't know he's dead and told us he was going to report dirty business between City Hall and this international building company, with a project of 500 million Euros for the land. The Mayor, local son, popular guy, a mustache, even bigger that yours, with a nice house with a pool and a son studying in London, which I doubt he can afford on his salary, There's a lot of money in this construction license. I want a wire on this motherfucker. Was it two minutes? That's funny but... if I remember correctly, this was a murder case. - And now you're talking corruption? - No, It's all wrapped together. A classic case of two crimes fucking in the same bag. Have you noticed the billboards on the streets? Those smiling gentleman surrounded by children? - There's going to be elections, you know? - So what? So if you arrest a politician for the Party 'A' today, tomorrow you'll have to arrest a politician for the Party 'B'! Or they'll talk about persecution. Are you trying to fuck me or what? - No, we're trying to fuck him! Here. - Everything's in here? We even used dots and commas, to help you read it. What's there to lose? If the guy gets bought, we catch the bastard. If it's nothing, Mr President goes on with his life and that's it. Call the Judge and ask for a wire to this guy's cell phone. But keep it out of the system. I don't want problems with those bastards from Economical Crimes. And one more thing. Be careful. Because when you start following money... - You never know where you end up. - Yeah. Now go work for a living. Always fucking with my day. I have a fucking ulcer, don't you guys know that? - Gomes! Stop fucking cursing, man! - Fuck you, man. Here we go! Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday, dear... Stand up, victims of hunger Stand up, those waiting for land The idea already created the flame that burns The hard crust that buries it! Well united we'll create In this final fight The land without masters The International Let's cut evil by the root Stand up, Stand up No more masters! - Hello? - Good afternoon, Mr President. Hi... Vickie?! You sound surprised. No, I was just with some people... I'm sorry. Are you in a rally? This weekend? Hum? Call me and confirm it? Good! Ah, I'll have a surprise for you. You like surprises? You're late Who were you talking to? Oh... I can't tell. You can tell uncle. - With my boyfriend. - You already have a boyfriend? What do you do with each other? Does he touch you? I'll tell if you buy me an ice cream. In this final fight This land... - You're not a man. - You're not going anywhere. If you were younger, I'd break that face of yours. I'd fuck you up. Fascist, fascist. Let the man be, leave him alone! Where were you? See where that got you? Well done, right? You encourage him when you know how he's like. Hi. Hi. Are you going to ask me for a drink? Ah, of course... What are you having? Vodka martini. - Vodka Martini for the lady, please. - How about you? I think I'll change to... malt whisky. Three ice cubes. You shouldn't put ice in a single malt. Just a drop of water. - You have much to learn. - Thank you. So... What about my surprise? I don't have any panties on. You're naughty. You have no idea. But there's more. - More? - More. I can't wait to suck your cock. I bet you're already hard for me. You wanna fuck me, don't you? Say you wanna fuck me. I want to, very much. No, I want you to say it out loud. I wanna fuck you hard, Vickie, please. And don't look around. - I wanna fuck you hard, Vickie, please. - Lauder! Don't look! Louder or I'll leave. I wanna fuck you hard, Vickie. Please. Same room. Meet me in five minutes. Ah! I hope I got it by now, honey. I'm a whore. An expensive one. If you need cash, there's an ATM right by the door. Check please. - Fuck me! - What? Today must be cup day, man. That broad with whom that fucker went to the room is out of his league! What the fuck, why do you keep messing with my suit? You're beautiful. You look like you're going to a wedding. Let me tell you, with that suit of yours, you would fit perfectly in a funeral. Do you... - Do you really have to leave? - Ui... You can't imagine my day. Weekends are always overbooked. Help me, please. I still have three more... ... meetings this afternoon. And three more, later tonight. Speaking of which, I'm late. What if I paid you to stay with me the whole day... and not having to deal with all those guys? That's a great idea. Do you have 5.000 Euros, in your pocket? Understand one thing, Carlos. I'm not a whore with a golden heart waiting to be saved. And you, don't take this personally, haven't got the money to take care of me. Your best chance is a couple of short term rentals. Listen. My taste is too expensive for a man like you. And I'm not talking about having dinner at the casino once a week. Or a fur coat on my birthday. No, honey I breathe luxury and I sweat Perrier. And you... you're very sweet. But you have a mustache and earn 3.000 Euros per month. - How about dinner? - What about dinner? Can I, at least, offer you a classy dinner? Maybe. That maybe is... Is it a yes? Let's say it's not a no. I call you later. Do you enjoy waiting periods? Is being seated one of your favorite sports? Then join the police. We guarantee hours of the most absolute boredom. I'm going for a coffee. Calm down. It's been almost an hour. And those broads run on a metter. Ui, wait a second, wait a second... Well... - You're not going to believe this shit... - Txi! - But I think that girl... - That's the broad! So, isn't she a knockout? She's what? The whore. Didn't I say that she would blow your mind? That's Meireles's whore? Yeah One thing is sure. That mustache... Has just spend his monthly pay on her. So, either he's getting some on the side, or he won't have enough greens to pay for electricity this month. Fuck! - Hello, honey. - Hi... - I ordered for you. - Thanks. I'm so tired... Sorry, baby, but we can't have dinner. My client anticipated our meeting. There's something I need to tell you, Carlos. The night we met... Mouros paid me. I was a present he offered you. I don't know about your life and it's none of my business. But I know Mouros... I know he never gives you 10, without being certain that he'll get 100 in return. So you should ask yourself. What do you have that he wants so much? I can approve this project he... Motherfucker wants to buy me. Scotch straight up. - I have to go. - Wait. Why are you telling me this now? Because you're a decent man, Carlos. And I just want you to know what you're getting yourself into. I'll call you later. Hello... How are you? Good to see you... Vickie? What is your problem, man? - You don't need to do this. - Hey, I'm talking you. Please, just give me a second. - That guy is... - Listen. Will you listen? See that Lamborghini? It's one of the seven he owns. One for every day of the week. He pays me 2.500 Euros, just for me to be available every time he comes to Lisbon. - Which is never more than twice a year. - All right. 30.000 Euros, Carlos, to fuck him twice a year. It's more than you earn in a year. The guy has strange habits. You don't want to know. But, for 2.500 Euros per month, who's complaining? Come on. Carlos, listen to me. You think I wouldn't rather to be with someone like you? A simple man, honest and decent? See you tomorrow? Go on, get some rest. Hey! - Fuck it, you're drunk, motherfucker? - No, no. Now I am, I'm legally inebriated. What the fuck is wrong with you? You call this late for me to watch you make a fool of yourself? - I know her. - Know who? That broad? - No, man... - What? What, what? Use your head, come on! Wait a second... - Meireles's whore? - Oh yes... Are you telling me that you know Meireles's whore? I met her when she was just turning twenty, man. Beautiful, you could die happy just by looking at her. - You're fucked. - I'll tell you a body, man, such fucking. I didn't even knew it was possible, man... If it was that good, why did it end? By that time, I had one thing in mind: Get into the police department. She had one thing in her mind: Get out of the desk job. And I couldn't keep up with her. That was... It was a luxurious animal, man. I was saving quarters on coffee, so you can imagine... Then I lost track of her. And, two years later, I find her picture on a fashion magazine. She was a model. She was a model, now she's a hooker. That's what called a rapid ascent of the social scale. Once a model, now a whore. Wait a second. And now what? What do you mean? This changes everything We have to tell Gomes. Ui... the little boy can't keep a secret. The case stands, ok? All the way. Enough talk. I'll be back in a while, han? Yes? Yes? - It's Ins. From Vilanova. - Who? I came as fast as I could. What's going on? There were more threats. From whom? I don't know. They keep at it, day and night. They call. They saw you leave the other day, I'm sure. Calm down! It's a good sign... It means we're on the right track. I have to get out of here, understand? If you could help... - I need money to get out of here. - Relax, ok? But I'm scared, can't you see? I'm so scared... I'm scared - Listen... - Really, please understand... Calm down. Easy... no, no, no. Calm down. Calm down. My night was kinda hard, ok? Not yet. Maybe the police could help me out with some cash... Quiet. Don't move, ok? Don't move... What is this shit? Is this good? Is it? What's this? You made the whole story up. You just made it all up, didn't you? Your husband found out that you were a fucking junkie? He found out that Joseph was supplying you, didn't he? And that he was fucking you as payment? Am I right? He found out and went to see Joseph, didn't he? And what happen? Joseph freaked out and killed him, right? Did or didn't he? It's all a lie. All a lie. There's no threats. Nobody was reporting a God damn thing. Fuck! I swear is true... I swear. I swear is true. He was going after them, I swear it's true, that part is true, I swear, swear... Don't leave me alone... You what this? Spend it well. I thought about what you said. Just one more time. Baby... I can use the help. But I don't think your boyfriend is gonna like the idea... You haven't seen those Gucci boots I'm talking about. Ah, right... I brought you something. Keep it. - It's to remember that love exists. - You're so sweet... This would be a lot more romantic, if you weren't asking me to fix you up with a guy that fucks you for money. He doesn't need to know. And those boots... They make a women feel valuable. Whatever you say. "I've got some time for us. When are you coming to Lisbon?" What's the matter? You don't like my new look? It's not that! Mr Jacinto hang himself. Tonight. With his belt. - What horror! - Jacinto... Hello. Minister? Hello, how are you? I mean, I don't see any relation... Well, if you see things on those terms, the patients in Vilanova will have to go to the Hospital in Beja, won't they? No, don't worry. We'll figure something out later. Yes. We'll talk. Goodbye. Dear Mouros, it seems that you lost your battle. No. We'll be playing golf in Vilanova come next year. - ... we'll talk. Goodbye. - Fuck this! Nothing yet? Hey... Do you get that feeling that, maybe, you're working your ass off on a guy who, maybe, is not gonna be bought? The Mayor is not in at the moment, but you can leave a... Is the guy alone? We'll start an inquire and that's it, right? I'm tired of your shit! You're wasting my time! Do you want to be on the cover of all the papers and magazines? Do you want your children to see this? On top of that, you kept your socks on! Were you cold? I'm offering you paradise, Meireles. A stack of bills, an amazing lover, your kids studying in London. And with money, even your wife will get off your back. And people will carry you on their shoulders, man. I'll get your hospital and you'll become the hero of Vilanova! I'm your guardian angel! What do I tell them? Three magic words: "Employment, development, progress". And, if you want, you can add "benefits". I like your new look. You've cut with the past. You look cool, dude! Welcome to the 21st century. I want that fucking project approved come next city hall meeting, understood? I'll see you tomorrow. Isn't that the arrangement? No. Vickie, I need to see you today. Not tomorrow, today! - What time will you be in Lisbon? - I don't know... - 25 minutes, half an hour I'll be there. - Half an hour is impossible. - Vickie, please. - Can't do it. - I have to be with you... - What's going on? - It's about Mouros, you were right... - What about Mouros? - The motherfucker has pictures of us. - Where? At the restaurant? No, not at the restaurant. In bed. In bed, do you get that? - Fucker! Look, take the money. - What? - Take the money. - Come on, come on, don't say that. I... Oh, fuck me, just what I needed. The cops are pulling me over. - The cops? - I've got to see you. Tell me an hotel. - The same? - No, not that one. It can't be the same! Another one, quickly, I need to pull over. - The Neptune. Neptune. - All right, bye. Fuck this fucking... just what I needed, the cops. What's going on? - We were this close to catching the guy. - Meireles? Of course. Listen to this. On top of all, the judge is saying he's going to close the case. If we don't have something in days, we're fucked. Listen! - It's about Mouros, you were right... - What about Mouros? - The motherfucker has pictures of us. - Where? At the restaurant? No, not at the restaurant. In bed. In bed, do you get that? - Fucker! Look, take the money. - What? - Take the money. - Come on, come on, don't say that. I... Oh, fuck me, just what I needed. The cops are pulling me over. - The cops? - I've to see you today. Tell me an hotel. - The same? - No, not that one. It can't be the same! Another one, quickly, I need to pull over. The Neptune. Neptune. - She's part of it. - What? She's talking him into it. - She's the fucking bait. - She's what? The bait. All right, but how is that going to help us? The bait? Maria? Vasco. I thought it was you. What is... what are you doing here? You know how it is. They say hotels always have the best bars. How about you? What a surprise. I... conference. I thought you were a fashion model. Wasn't that your dream? A fashion model. It was. I started as a fashion model. I ended up on a pharmaceutical company. The way the world turns, h? Well, I'm late. I have to go. You... look... fantastic. You... look the same. Is that good or bad? Wait. Let's have a drink. For old time's sake. - Can't do it. I'm late. - Come on... I haven't seen you in five years and you can't spare five minutes? Five. One for each year? I'll take the stairs. You know I'm not gonna let you go until I get your phone number, right? Aren't you a cop? Find out! It would be a lot nicer if you gave it to me. Wait for it. Hello, honey! Damn, Vickie I've been waiting for two hours! Couldn't you call off at least one client? One? You cut your mustache? Was it because of me? You're so sweet... No, Vickie, no, for Christ's sake. I can't take it this way. You know I'm fucked and you put me in this situation. I've been waiting for hours, looking like an idiot... without knowing if you would even show up! If this is the conversation... I'm leaving No, no, no. Come here. Come here. Don't leave, please. So, go on What's this thing about Mouros? And why a different hotel? Mouros, that son of a bitch, has pictures of us. - What? - It gets worse... In bed... - Motherfucker! - Huge motherfucker... I warned you! He says he'll send them to the newspapers if I... If I don't... I don't fucking know what to do, God damn it. I'm completely desperate. I don't know... I can't trust anyone... Vickie... I only feel well, I only feel calm... when I'm near you... Yes, honey, but things are getting too complicated for me. No, no, please. Please no. I beg you. Come here, listen to me, Vickie. Stay with me, for the love of God. Honey... I need you. I love you... I love you... You can't afford it! I told you that. Love is a very expensive sport. Vickie, no... listen! Go on, then. Go on... Stop making things complicated... All you need is to sign a project? That's all that Mouros wants, right? Go on, then... What are you waiting for? All right. He'll give me the money... and you'll have anything you want. Anything you want. I'll approve the fucking project. But promise you'll stay with me. - Forever... always! - I will. - Yes. - Always... always. - Let's go to bed. - Yes. Come on! Don't lie to me, Meireles. I saw you with her, on the street. - No, you didn't... - I followed you. I know where she lives. - I'm going to kill the cow, she's a whore! - No you're not! Nothing? - I'm going to tell your wife. - This is none of my wife's business. She needs to know there's another one. She's a huge cow. - There's no one. - I'll... I'll kill her. - You won't kill anything. Shut up! - You're a liar, you're full of shit. I'm not a liar, you got it wrong... Hello, Maria. Hi, it's Vasco. Look over there? How hot is that? I know that piece of ass, man. I fucked her. Come here. Crazy bastard... I know you. Maybe, but not today, all right? Another day. You blew me, some time ago. Don't you remember or are you playing hard to... You know what? I blew a lot of guys like you. But I can't tell you apart. Basically, you all look the same. Well, one blow job more won't make that much of a difference. Did you know impure thoughts are a cause for acne? How about we turn this around? I'll pay you to get out of my sight. It'll do wonders for your skin. You're not following. You're coming with me to the bathroom and you'll suck my cock. Do you understand, you fucking whore? Hey... Is everything fine? - Kinda nervous, are you? - No. - Are we cool or what? - No, no. Go home and beat on your wife? Have you seen the time? Go on easy, boy. Maria, are you all right? You're fucked, man. You're so fucked. Do you see this shit? Do you see it? Can you see this shit? Can you? Can you see it, motherfucker? Calm down! Sorry about that, it's a professional flaw. But you don't have any pharmaceutical books, do you? I'm not like you. I don't like to bring work home. Was I that bad? Let's say... You were somewhat boring. Then why are you nervous every time we meet? What makes you think I'm nervous? Don't tell me you don't feel it. What? This. Every time we look at each other. This. What's this? You fucking know what it is. This. Is this the moment when you're gonna tell me you love me? That you love me and you never forgot about me? If I knew it was that, I would have put some romantic music on. No. But I'm going to kiss you, take you to your bedroom and fuck you just like back in the day. You're still a sweetheart, but you'll never make it to the bedroom. Job well done, Mr Mouros. Will you be reachable if anything comes up? As long as you got the money. Carlos... - Carlos... Carlos! - Yes, what? What do you want? Have you lost your mind? How could you? No, I came to my senses. Have you seen what has become of this? This town needs youth, new life, or else, we'll had end up at the Home. I can't believe what I have just heard at the meeting. You're betraying the memory of all those old men. Jacinto's, your father's. Did they die for nothing? Don't you think Jacinto knew? Don't you think my father knows? He has known for a long time, I promise that. It's why he doesn't talk anymore, so he doesn't have to tell what's in his soul. Carlos, how about our roots? Our memories? The majority approved it. Period. Don't tell me that crap. The majority do what you tell them to do. Don't waste more time. It's over. The papers are signed, the construction is starting. That's it. Carlos! How about the Cork Oaks? Fuck the Cork Oaks, man! Do you know who I am? Meireles never told you about me? Never? He never told you about me? Only as fine print. You don't have enough costumers? - Did you have to steal my man? - Lower your voice, honey. You're a whore. Don't you think I know that? I'm going to the stairs and scream for your neighbors to know you're a whore. You're a whore. I've seen you with... My favorite top. - Do you believe this? - Anything you want to tell me? Don't worry, Vasco. You used a condom last night. Remember? You insisted. Fuck, Maria... When we were together... Did you? I mean... Was that why? No, Vasco. Relieved? Or are you disappointed? Maybe it turns you on, the idea of dating a whore. I can charge you, if you want. If that makes you hard. What are you going to ask me next, Vasco? Have I no shame? What to know the truth? It's incredible how easy shame disapears. Your first time, you cry. You get home smelling... of sweat and sex. The first thing you do is take a shower. Water burning... And you stay there for hours. Then... you get used to it. And end up liking what you do. I'm the best, Vasco. I earn more in a day's work than in a month working at the jewelry store. So, you're happy? No, I'm not happy. But I'll rather be unhappy in my Audi... than sitting at the back of a bus. What about now? Do you still wanna kiss me? I thought whores never kissed on the mouth. There's always one motherfucke who makes us bend the rules. You scared the shit out of me. Hey, and where the fuck where you all day? I've been calling you every hour, man. - What's that? - Don't ask. Check this out. What the hell is this? I'm in no mood for reading. This is the license for construction at Herdade da Fazenda. The Cork Oaks are going down as we speak. And that is Meireles's bank statement, with a single income: 3.000 Euros worth of wages. Then this means he got paid in cash, right? It's a matter of time until he starts showing off his new found wealth. Yeah, right. But time is exactly what we don't have. You know the guys who get bought, take years before they're confident enough to spend their money. And no money, no case. The game is not over until the final whistle, man. Welcome to the wonderful world of Cash. And don't forget to give twenty per cent to the Party. Accomplices are always handy. You stay protected that way. Ah, the code is 1945, the year you were born. And if you need anything else... Mouros isn't my name, and neither is that one. What can I do, I'm like Vickie or Fernando Pessoa. I change names according to my clients... or my inspiration. Ah, and Meireles! Try not to spend it all on hookers. Good afternoon. I have appointment with Helga at four o'clock. What is it? Please, tell me what happened with Helga? What's wrong? Helga is at Cascais's hospital. Her boyfriend beat her up last night. She's in a coma. Who says the cops are never there when you need them? I thought it was funny, to call a cop to change a tire. I can't believe a woman like you doesn't know how to change one by herself. How do you open this thing? What do you mean by that? A woman like me? And what's this thing men have that they're the superior species just because they have a cock and know how to handle a fucking Jack? What's your problem? You called me to come and help you, right? My problem is you, Vasco! You're my problem. People just don't reappear in other people's lives just like that. So you tell me. Why did you call me in the first place? I don't know. - I wanted to be with you. - Stop fucking lying. So I'm the liar, am I? All right. Ok. I'm not the one playing around as Vickie, am I? Or pretending that I'm someone else? Wait a moment, did you say Vickie? Did you say Vickie? Fucking look at me. Did you say Vickie? Motherfucker. You're after Meireles, aren't you? Fuck, Vasco. Fuck. You... Do you know what you are? You're the biggest whore I have ever met. Maria, wait a second. Fuck. Come on? What are you doing? No, no, don't do that. Step outside. Stop that. - Are you out of your mind or what? - Get the fuck in. Are you crazy? You better buckle up. - Having fun? Slow down, please. - Do you have a wire on Meireles? - Slow this shit down, please. - Is Meireles on a wire? - Slow down the fucking car... - Or else? Or else... I don't know, I'll arrest you. Got that? Keep your hands on the wheel. What do you want from me? What I want from you? I need you, Maria. Keep your eyes on the road. I need you to make Meireles admit on his cell that he took money to license that project, do you understand? - Anything else? - Yes ma'm. I want you to talk him into leaving the country with you and his money. I wanna caught him red-handed, understand that too. What makes you think I'll help you? Just because you're a good fuck? Because it's the only way I can keep you out of the case. If you collaborate. Because if you don't, do you know what happens, baby? Accomplice, you're an accomplice. Get that? Accomplice... - Accomplice? - Accomplice. Are you kidding me? - This has nothing to do with me. - We have you on the wire, Maria. We know you talked Meireles into taking the money... Maria, I'm trying to help you. But if you don't do as I ask, you're completely fucked. And then, neither I or anyone can help you, do you understand? You're such a motherfucker. I'm never gonna get rid of you, am I... - What is that, is it... - It wasn't a question. I'll think about it. In the meantime, I want you to promise that you'll catch the fucker who beat a friend of mine. It shouldn't be hard... His name is there. The stupid girl fell in love. Everybody has their weak spot, don't they? Vickie? - Good night, Mr President. - Hi. - I'm I talking to a rich man already? - I think so. How much did they offer? Let me guess. Three million? - More. - Five? Yes. - Cash? - Of course. - Great. Did you approve the project? - I did. Motherfucker! Caught you now! Open sesame! Let's eat him rare. Find this guy! I thought five million Euros would be more impressive. It's my first time at your place. I never bring clients home. But now... You're more than a client. What's the matter? Scared of having that much money at hand, is that it? It's all this shit at the same time. Carlos, look at me. - You know what you could do? - What? Open a foreign account and put the money there. What do you think? We'll take the chance and spend a week abroad, just the two of us. - Let's say... London. - London... From there, you can open an account at the Cayman Islands. And we'll be together, with no one to bother us. - We can do some shopping... - A lot of shopping... - And go to shows at the West End. - West End, wherever you want. - And we can even watch Chelsea play... - Chelsea, that's great. A week when you won't have to think of nothing, nothing, nothing but me. What do you say? I say that's all very pretty but... How do I carry the money through the airport? Oh, honey. I'm sure it's not that hard. It's only paper. But, if you want to, I'll carry the bag with me. And say it's mine. That way, you won't take any chances. And what do I tell Odete? You can tell her you're going to visit your son... I'm sure she's suspicious by now... with so many trips to Lisbon. Wanna try my bed? This apartment is starting to look like a whorehouse. Voil. The stupid bastard really trusts you!? Take some, if you want. You're arresting him so he won't complain. You booked the flight? - Yes, inspector. - Great. - Two seats for tomorrow night. - Cool. Last flight. He went to say goodbye to the little wife... Very decent... But I also booked... two tickets to Rio de Janeiro, right the next day. - One for me. The other for you. - Maria... Look at me. Come down to Earth, will you? I'm on the other side, get that? I can't get myself in that kind of shit. You really won't change, will you? Listen, what took him so long? I was waiting in the car for more than one hour. This fucking heat... Because we were fucking, Vasco. Were you? Yes. Does he fuck you as well as I do? Does he make you come? What makes you think you make me come? What? When you come... you bite your lip, right here... Look, I'm tired. You should leave. Let your work colleagues put up with you. This isn't just about work, Maria. - Isn't it? - No. Then prove it. What do you want me to do? Get down on my knees? I want to keep the money. What? Out of the question. You can't keep the fucking money. Look. I'm not thinking about me, Vasco. - I'm thinking about us. - The money is evidence. And you think arresting that poor bastard is making any difference? That's not the fucking point. The money is the evidence I need. You said that twice already. Are you running out of arguments or are you trying to convince yourself? Listen, this is not open for discussion, ok? I promised I'd keep you out of the case and that's what I'm gonna do, now don't ask for anything more. Stop fucking with my head! I'm not fucking Meireles! Yes, Inspector. I should've known that you'll never change. You'll be a cop... until you die old... alone and poor. And not even then will you think that you could have had a better life. You understand what I said? Wanna fuck? What do you think? How much money do you have on you? You're kidding, right? What's your problem? Aren't you the one who always put his profession above all? Well, I think you're right. We need rules. If you want to fuck, you pay. So, let me ask you again... Do you have any money? Or are you just a hard-on? I'm not Meireles... No. You're less. Because Meireles, at least, pays. He's a costumer. How about you, Vasco? What are you? You tell me. Do you really want to know? You're my weak spot. Meireles, I made this for Filipe. - He loves my pasties. - Oh, good. - Meireles! - Hum, hum? Do you notice anything? Meireles? The earrings you bought me! - Ah, right... - They're beautiful. - I didn't notice. Didn't look. - Sit down, I'll pack for you. Meireles... I'm so sorry I can't go with you... We talked about that, didn't we? We can't leave the girl alone. Specially now she's starting with her exams. I know, I know... - Do you know what I was thinking about? - No. Remember our wedding day, thirty years ago? - Absolutely, you were wearing white. - Don't be smart. It's just that you looked so handsome, thinner, like a prince. I know Meireles. - I know I've become demanding. - No. But that's because I always wanted the best for you and for us. And now, I don't know why, I feel you're going to give us a better life... ...I don't know... those meetings with the Minister of Health. Even that new look... Meireles, we deserve it! - Of course, of course we deserve it. - Carlos! Yes! Carlos! Carlos, how long has it been... since we? Boss! We just won the championship. We have Meireles admitting on his cell he took the money. - Go on, get out of there. - There's more. We know he's going to leave the country. We know the day, the hour, the flight number, we even know what he's eating on board. Have you told the District Attorney? He's leaving the country while investigated, we don't need permission. But I want it discreet, just the two of you! No show-off, ok!? I'll go upstairs and tell the director, just in case. Everything is tight. - I hope there's no fuck ups this time. - Ok. Hey man, is it time to... What? Man, I can't believe it. Yes. No, no. Don't do anything. I'll take care of it. A whore is always a whore. You can clean her up and dip her in gold, but she'll always try and fuck you. - Is something wrong? - No. Go ahead and warm up. Hello! Sorry about the time. It's urgent. - Hello, honey. - Hi. Everything's right here. What? I thought you were gonna bring more luggage. I have this suspicion you won't want me dressed that often... - Well, let's go! - Let's go. Yes? It's going on right now. What!? Here's your ticket. Enjoy your flight. Fuck! Fuck! - Where's my scarf? - I don't know. I must have left it in the coffee shop. I'll be right back, all right? Gomes? Yeah? Yes, yes. We're moving on him right now. What? You're kidding! Oh, fuck me. Fuck! Dr. Carlos Meireles? Vasco! Police. You're been arrested for suspicion of corruption and traffic of influence. - Vasco, don't. - Don't what? Gomes's orders. - Dr. Meireles is not to be arrested. - Get the fuck out of here. - The guy is right here, he has the money. - I'm sure this is a mistake. - Shut up, or I'll fuck you up, listen? - Calm down. Call Gomes, right now! I wanna speak to him now! - You can't treat people like this... - I'm so sorry, you cocksucker. - What's in the bag? - Calm down. - I have no idea. - You have no idea? No idea? I know what you did, you fuck! - Louder. I can't hear you. - I have no idea what's in the bag. - The bag is not mine. - Who does it belong to, then? - This lady. - Is it true? Does the bag belong to you? No. I don't even know this gentleman. You don't know me, you whore? - I'm the one who fucked you yesterday. - Calm down! Calm down, Vasco. Let go of me. Let me go. I'm all right. You want the bag, don't you? Isn't it yours? I know what you did, motherfucker. I know what's inside. And it will fuck you, won't it? What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this? Where's the money? Where's the money, man? Han? That fucking whore! Move! Just go. Go. Calm down! You don't know what you're missing. Are you going to tell me what happen? - Do want me to tell you? - Tell me. Let me explain. One: According to the judge, you guys were over the deadline for the wire. Therefore, all that information is inadmissible. Two, Meireles had a two way ticket. Three: Tampering evidences, do you know what I mean, should I draw you a picture? Four: Your main witness, Ins Gonalves, just confirmed her husband was killed by Joseph and you knew about it. So, you're not talking now? Cat got your tongue? Look, Gomes, we can talk about whatever you want, ok? About the rules, ethics, whatever. But one thing I know. That motherfucker is corrupt, I caught him and you let him walk. You still don't get it? This isn't a western and you're not the sheriff! Who fucked this shit up? Who stoped this shit? According to what's written here, you're the bad guy in this film. You fucked this case completly. No one else. Got it? You're not a bad guy. The problem is, when someone has their heart on their balls, like you, they should at least keep their head on the right place. Fuck me! You don't say anything? Ok. You know what, Gomes? Fuck you. A guy works his ass off and for what? For what? In this country, any motherfucker with half a brain can do whatever he wants. I'd do better being a whore. I'd still get fucked, but at least I'd get paid. All we do is play at being cops. Fuck. Listen, kid... Yes. Yes? Is it? Great! Sure. Of course. No, I make a note out here. Now. Avenue, yes... Avenue... 47... Ok, ok, cool. Yes, yes. We'll get him at sun light. Thanks. They identified the guy who beat up the masseuse. He's married and lives with his family, if you can believe it. Give me a good reason to keep dealing with that son of a bitch. Just one. One good reason to keep being a cop? One! Let me tell you something, kid! In twenty... twenty or so years I have on the job, I had to arrest guys that almost made me weep. Poor bastards who slipped up, for love or for despair. And I had to let some huge motherfuckers walk, the kind that made me wish I'd put a bullet in their fucking brains. Got it? And the guy today was more of a 'feel sorry' kind of guy. Fuck that. The motherfucker is corrupt and he got away with it. That's that, man! The guy was a poor bastard who got himself bewitched by your girl! If there's someone who should understand that, it's you. You. Fuck you. The motherfuckers are a different species, Madeira. Like this fucker we're gonna arrest in a little while! You should be a priest, you know that? The only problem is that you curse too much. - Otherwise, you'd be perfect for it. - I missed my calling! But let me tell you, that broad really worked you up classic style. If we think about it, you were saved by the bell. Can you imagine how you would look, showing up to Gomes, with that little bag filled with travel magazines?! Listen up! Go and take a cold shower. It'll be good for your temper. And meet me in front of this guy's apartment, early light, ok? Here's the address. Go on. What makes you think I'll show up? Adrenaline! And you know what? This world is a pile of shit. But it would be a lot worse if we weren't around. Go on! I'm not drinking that anymore. How does your wife... I mean... How come she still makes you coffee every morning? I like thinking it's because I make her happy with those everyday things. With all the cuddle I give her. But, to be honest, what makes Clara be by my side, it's my enormous cock. In a good day, it comes down to my knee. She left this for you. Let's go! You don't know what you're missing. Let's go!
