[DANIEL] IMAGINE YOU ARE ONE OF THESE FOUR HARD-WORKING, FOCUSED YOUNG MEN, AT THE STAR OF YOUR DREAM CAREER, A CAREER THAT WILL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM YOUR HUMBLE BEGINNINGS, AND TO A WORLD OF INFINITE POSSIBILITIES. YOU ARE HYPED UP. BLOOD FILLED WITH A HEALTHY SURGE OF MID-COMPETITION TESTOSTERONE, WHEN YOU ARE SUDDENLY CONFRONTED WITH A DRUNK, ANGRY SUPPORTER OF THE COMPETITION, TRYING TO PSYCHE YOU OU WITH A TORREN OF THE MOST SHOCKING AND PAINFUL RACIST ABUSE. IMAGINE SOMEONE LOOKS YOU IN THE EYE ON THE BEST NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE AND CALLS YOU A NIGGER. AND TELL ME THAT YOUR RESPONSE, HOWEVER MILD, HOWEVER IMPASSIONED... IS UNPROVOKED. [GAVEL SLAMS] WOULD THE DEFENDANTS PLEASE RISE? I HEREBY SENTENCE HUNTER, CAMPBELL, AND LAWRENCE TO TWO YEARS IN HER MAJESTY'S PRISON. AS FOR YOU, WOLFAVITZ, I HAVE TAKEN INTO ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION THE SUBMISSION FROM YOUR SOLICITOR, THAT CONSIDERING YOUR BACKGROUND AND EDUCATION, THIS SITUATION WAS NOT TYPICAL OF YOUR PREVIOUS CHARACTER, AND THAT YOU WERE TO A GREATER EXTEN PLAYING THE NAIVE GAME OF FOLLOW-MY-LEADER. YOU ARE SENTENCED TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS. BAILIFF, TAKE THEM DOWN. [GAVEL SLAMS] TEN MONTHS ALREADY SERVED ON REMAND. THEY'LL BE OUT IN, LIKE, SIX MONTHS WITH TAGS ON THEIR ANKLES.

IN THE END, YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN HOW THEY'D REAC TO A PAIR OF BATTY BOYS. THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW BETTER, AND YOU ARE. KEVAN, WE CAN' THINK LIKE THIS, MAN. THEY CAN? OH, THEY CAN FEEL WHAT THEY LIKE BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL RECOVERING FROM SLAVERY, IS THAT IT? WE'RE NO SLAVE-OWNERS. WE'RE NOT RACISTS. DOES THAT MEAN WE HAVE TO BE FUCKING PUNCH-BAGS JUST BECAUSE WE'RE LIBERAL WHITE QUEERS? ALL RIGHT, THEY DON' HAVE TO LOVE US BACK BUT DO THEY HAVE TO HATE US? ONE OF THEM WAS WHITE, REMEMBER.

I'M SORRY TO HAVE BOTHERED YOU AT HOME. WHAT DO YOU WANT? JUSTICE. I KNOW THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT IF YOUR PARTNER'S ATTACKERS HAD BEEN JAILED FOR LIFE, THAT WOULD BE JUSTICE. IT WOULD NOT. AS REPELLENT AND DEPRESSING AS THEY ARE, THOSE IGNORANT BULLIES ARE NOT WHAT HAS CAUSED YOUR UNSPEAKABLE SUFFERING. THEY ARE MERELY THE CARRIERS OF THE DISEASE THAT STRUCK YOUR LOVER DOWN. I USED TO THINK THIS DISEASE WAS SOCIETY. STRUGGLING TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS SENSELESSNESS, TO FATHOM THIS BRUTALITY, UNTIL YESTERDAY, [RADIO PLAYS] I CAME ACROSS THIS... EXTRAORDINARY SOUND. BASS, DRUMS. HYPNOTIC. SEDUCTIVE. SEXY. HIJACKING THE VERY BEA OF MY CORRUPTIBLE HEART. UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF CHANTING TOO. BOOM GO A GA IN A BATTY BWOY'S BRAIN GO ON PULL A TRIGGER IN A NIGGER BROTHA'S NAME SEND A CHI-CHI MAN TO HELL WITH A SPIKE IN HIS EYE CHI-CHI MAN DIE, CHI-CHI MAN DIE. I'VE GOOGLED CHI-CHI ON THE NET. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS? TERMITE. COCKROACH. VERMIN. VERMIN. AND I WAS SINGING ALONG. AND THEN I LOOKED TO MY RIGHT. BOOM GO A GA IN A BATTY BWOY'S BRAIN OUR BRAINS WERE BEING COLONISED, INFECTED. GWAN PULL THE TRIGGA IN A NIGGER BRUTHA'S NAME I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE OU A CIVIL CASE AGAINST THE COMPOSERS, PRODUCERS, AND PERFORMERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MUSIC. THEY ARE THE DISEASE. WE CAN BE THE CURE. AND THAT, PERHAPS, MIGHT BE SOMETHING LIKE JUSTICE. [ORLY] J.J.? STAY IN THE BATHROOM, BABE, I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE. [ORLY] J.J., LOOK AT MY FOOTSTEPS, I'M ROBINSON CRUSOE!

CONVENIENTLY, IT'S THE TITLE. "BOOM GO A GA IN A BATTY-BOY BRAIN." J.J.? 'GAT?' GUN. 'BATTY-BOY?' I KNOW WHA BATTY-BOYS ARE. I THINK THE WORD 'BRAIN' IS UNIVERSAL. "BANG GOES A GUN IN A QUEER BOY'S BRAIN." [MUSIC RESUMES] GWAN PULL A TRIGGA INNA NIGGA BRUDDA NAME "GO ON, PULL A TRIGGER IN THE NAME OF BLACK MEN." SEN' A CHI-CHI MAN A HELL WIT A SPIKE IN THE EYE [MUSIC STOPS] "SEND A CHI-CHI MAN TO HELL WITH A SPIKE IN THE EYE." IT'S JUST MUSIC. JUST MUSIC? [DANIEL] MUSIC CAN BE INFLUENTIAL. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE NATIONAL ANTHEMS, AND HYMNS, AND FOOTBALL CHANTS. SO IF THERE WERE NO FOOTBALL CHANTS, MUSIC CAN BE A RALLYING CRY. YEAH, MUSIC CAN BE A LOT OF THINGS. BEFORE I FOUND ORLY, MUSIC WAS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HELP ME. DID IT HELP YOU BE GAY? WHAT MUSIC HELPED YOU BE GAY? RUFUS WAINWRIGHT. HIS FIRST ALBUM WAS MY COLLEGE BIBLE. AND IF RUFUS TOLD YOU TO GO OUT AND SHOOT PEOPLE, WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IT? NO. WHY NOT? [SAM] 'CAUSE HE'S A NICE WELL-EDUCATED WHITE BOY. AND WE'RE A BUNCH OF IMPRESSIONABLE JUNGLE-BUNNIES WHO DON' KNOW ANY BETTER. IS THA WHAT YOU THINK I MEAN? DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN? YOU FIND THIS MUSIC ACCEPTABLE? I FIND IT PAINFUL. BUT SOME PEOPLE FIND THE SIGH OF TWO MEN KISSING PAINFUL. IS IT RIGH TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL? THOSE ARE THEIR ISSUES. THESE ARE OUR LIVES. ARE YOU REALLY SUGGESTING THAT CHALLENGING BLACK PEOPLE ON HOMOPHOBIA IS AUTOMATICALLY RACISM? ARE YOU PLANNING TO PICKE ANY WHITE ARTISTS? LIKE? LIKE EMINEM? GUNS AND ROSES? KATY PERRY? I NEED TO LISTEN TO MORE MUSIC. HERE'S THE THING, DANIEL. BLACK PEOPLE EXPEC TO BE UNDER ATTACK. IF YOU GO AFTER THE HANDFUL OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING ANY MONEY, ALL WE'LL SEE IS ANOTHER WHITE MAN TRYING TO TAKE OUR POWER. THIS ISN'T ABOU BLACK AND WHITE.
