How do I know you won't just take the cash and run? You'll know cause you'll have it. I've been planning this job for six months. I'll be one step ahead of you. So are you in or not? Yeah, I'll do it. I'll do it. What's next? Believe me, it's a piece of cake. The plan is flawless. Okay, let's pretend here's the bank. It's located in a quiet neighborhood. This is the front door. What you're gonna do is park right here, leave the car door open to fool the cops. They'll believe you left the car there to use in the escape. Those idiots will fall for anything. Give me that. The point is to get your hands on the cash in the vault right here. The most important thing is to get the keys. See what I mean? Easy. Just keep a sharp eye on it. Who knows? Some off-duty cop might show up to pay his mortgage or something. It's all we need. What is this? No one wants to work today? Uh, Olga, more bills. Well, what can we do? I'm sorry, sir, but could you date this for me, please? Oh. Only for you then. What the hell did you do, you psycho? Did you hear me? What the hell is wrong with you? Do you realize you just killed two cops? Don't you get it? You just screwed the whole thing up. Grom, come on, we gotta get out of here. The keys ... who has the keys? Don't try to act tough. Everybody down. Move it. Where are the keys? I'm not gonna ask you again. Where are the fucking keys? -Get down! -Do you hear me? Tell me where the keys are or I'll put a bullet in your skull. Put the gun down now. -Get down, you hear me? -Do you understand? I want the fucking keys and I'll start shooting people one by one until you give them to me! Nobody moves until we say you move. Keep your fucking mouths shut and nobody gets hurt! Keep your faces down on the ground! They hit the alarm! Bring some hostages. -No, please, I don't want to go. -Give me your hands. Get up. That way. Move. Get down! Police! Hold it right there. Get down on the floor. -Shut up. -Let me go. Please let me go. When you leave the bank you'll be in front of an old theater. Try not to attract attention. Just get to the junkyard. It's not far, about 100 yards. Hurry. In there. Move. If you just stick to the plan things will go as easy as pie. -In there? -Move it. -Let go of me, jerk. -Please don't make me go down there. Go go! Go on! Let's go, let's go, let's go. Sir, nothing yet. We've set up roadblocks. We've got men going door to door. We've got a two-mile radius from the bank. It's like they disappeared, sir. Keep looking. They're out there somewhere. Yes, of course, sir. We've got IDs on them. What are you doing? Move. What are you doing? Move. Listen, why did Kostya take the cop's machine gun? Keep an eye on him. Uh-huh, you got it. You enter the tunnels through the hatch. It's a hell of a mess down there, but you'll have a map. Make sure you follow it. You go first. The stairs are rusty. They might collapse. You should be so lucky. Shut up and move. Kirk, let's go. I can't do this ... these stairs. Let me go. You have to let me go. I won't tell anyone. Please let me go. Stop crying. You have to calm down, Katya, please. Why do I have to calm down? Why should I? What difference does it make? Because these guys are killers. Don't you understand? We could both die down here because of you. Now follow me. Come on. You'll be okay. Stay with me. Move! Move it. I'm going. I'm going. Faster. ENTRANCE EXI What the hell is your problem? Move it. Don't stop. Keep moving. You cannot make me go. You can't make me go. I can't go on. Please, I just can't. Shut the fuck up or I'll blow your brains. Now get down here. We've got about 200 yards until the turn. Let's keep moving. Hey, ladies, have you heard the stories about a freak that's supposed to live down here? That's right, yeah. They gathered up a bunch of people that were affected by the Chernobyl disaster. As a matter of fact, they say you could see them glow in the dark. keep them in the hospital, so they decided that they would keep them locked up underground. Doctors tried to find a cure, but every one of them died except one. And that one survivor freaked out and killed all the doctors, then escaped down here into the tunnels. So keep your eyes open. I'll put up markers. They'll help point you in the right direction. You'll need to use this ultraviolet light to see them. Come on, move it. Come on, move it. Did I scare you? Get your asses moving. Splint. We're getting close now. Take the next left, then a right. Come on, move faster. Okay, stop here. What are you standing for? Sit your asses down. Kostya, Kostya, the guy's not here. Relax. You said that he'd be here. Yeah, he'll be here if nothing goes wrong. And what exactly do you think could go wrong? You told us that he'd be here and he's not. Yeah, so what's the point? We got it all worked out. So relax. Cops are gonna be onto us. I mean, we can't wait here forever. Grom, what's the problem, man? I did what I had to do, right? If I waited any longer this cop would have made us. We'd probably all be in prison. Right, pig? Tell me you're not serious. That's your fucking story? What about the cops that you burned? Grom, Grom, Grom, enough enough, man. Chill out. Move. This is cozy. You two are really lucky. Probably your bosses will give you the rest of the day off. Plus you get to spend all this quality time with me in the tunnels. Splint, for Christ's sake, come out here. Kostya told me your plan, so now we all know. Come on out. Bastard. Prettier on you. Let her go. Let her go. Bitch. Jealous? You're next. Let her go, asshole. What did you say, pig, huh? Please don't. Hey, why don't you untie his hands first? Even my granny could beat up a guy with his hands tied. Now what, pig, huh? Let's see how much you can take. Knock it off. What the hell is your deal? You tell me, Kostya. You and Splint have been making us double back, man. Calm down, Grom. It's all good. We'll be out soon. I told you before, you can trust me. Some assholes dream that one day they'll end up on a pretty beach on an island. Instead they end up dead. You're not one of those assholes, are you? You and me are buddies, right? Right, Kostya? Yeah. Like I've been saying, trust me on this. I'm telling you, Grom, we'll be out of here soon. All your worrying will be for nothing. What is it? What is it? So did you want to explain this? It's ... it's ... it's Splint's helmet. Why did he bring a helmet? He's got a car, doesn't he? Doesn't sound right. You shut the fuck up, got it? Enough. Let's keep moving. This is our chance, Kostya. You gotta take a shot like this. Could be your only one. Where are you, Splint? You're just gonna stand there? You're leading us out of here. I can't go any further. Move. Let's go. I said move. Leave her alone already. I need to go to the bathroom. You need? I'll show you what you need. It's all right. Let her go. Don't take too long. Go. Do it fast. Help me! Help me! What? What is it? There there. Look. Splint. What is it, Splint? What? What do you say? Get out of here. What? Get out? Which way is it? Splint, Splint. Which way is it, Splint? -Is that Splint? -Splint, right. So how do we get out? I don't know. You said you knew the way. I don't. Where are you going, cop? Did you see blood on that helmet? Yes, I did. I think we should tell Grom. Shh. Grom, Grom, maybe it's for the better. We'll have more money. We can find the way without him. Quiet. Turn off your flashlights. What's going on? What is it? This is madness. What kind of person could do this? TRACKMAN Kostya, Kostya, get over here. You need to watch the hostages. Kirk, follow me. Everybody get down now. Untie my hands. I won't run. Shut up, pig. Looks like a homeless guy lives here. What the hell is this? Kostya sent me here to get you. Let's go. TRACKMAN Let's get out of here quick. Grom, this could be a trap. Why do you think that? Just a feeling, and a bad one. We should go back the way we came. We're sitting ducks here. Kirk, you take point. I'll cover you. Move. Let us out of here. -Open the gate. -Let us out. Kirk. Hey, shut up. Be quiet. Quiet. Okay, come on. You go over that way. Go make noise. I'll make noise. Blow it with a grenade? No, it'll bury us in here. ver there. Look, there it is. Calm down. Be quiet. I saw something moving down there. I saw it. -What? -There's nobody out there. Shut up. Everyone keep it down. Something's there. I saw it. Kirk, better go and check it out. Shh, quiet down. DANGER ZONE PASSAGE CL0SED DANGER ZONE PASSAGE CLOSED -What did you find? -It's a dead end. -You checked everything? -Sure. We gotta get out of here without the others. It'll be easier. Look, Grom, let's split the cash and separate. What do you say? Which way are you going? It doesn't matter. The way Splint got here, on a bike? I just want my share, that's all. Aren't you afraid? Listen, man, I'll take it and go. What if I said you don't have a share? I want my share. I want my money now! I said give me it now! Okay, just calm down, Kostya. Come on, come on, give it here. Your share? I got your share right here, motherfucker. You want it? Well, you're gonna get it. Look at this. He's got a UV light. Now tell me, what the hell do you need this for? I saw it. I saw it. He was lighting up the wall with that lamp. -Now would you do that? -Splint left markers. -How did he get here? On a motorcycle? -I don't know. -Don't lie to me. -I swear. -You were gonna kill us, right? -Yes. -Thought you'd get rid of us, huh? -Yes. Who else is in on it with you? Who's down here? It's just the two of us, nobody else. -I don't believe you. -I don't know. I'm gonna count to three. One ... -No, really. -Two ... Three! Come on, tell me. Come on, let's hear it. Let's hear it. Nobody else was in on it. Fucker. He doesn't know who it is. Could be more than one. Wrap your hand with this. That's enough. We've got to keep alert. We need a plan. This way. Hey ... they left us. you going? Stop, you bitch! It's okay. Stay calm. -Let me go. Let me go. -Bitch. Don't move. Don't move. I swear ... -What is it? -No no. -What happened? -I can't ... What is it? I want to know what the fuck happened. He was ... he was there. Who? Where's Kostya? He's gone. He took him. He just took him. All right, all right. Now go and join the others. Look, just go. No, I can't go there. -It's gonna be all right. -No, it won't. I can't be alone. Get your ass over there. Go on, get going. Stop. Where are you going? Come back here. I'm with Internal Affairs in the police department. This is Senior Staff Sergeant Anatoly Pakhomov. Put your hands in the air and come out here now. That's an order. And then you'll surrender yourself to me immediately. Comply or we will be forced to begin opening fire with intent to kill and, I assure you, no prisoners taken. You all through? Now listen to me, Sergeant. I'm in charge here, meaning no more speeches. Am I clear? Nah, he's off the deep end. Give me his gun. What are you doing, Grom? We're gonna establish a perimeter. Stay with the girls. Right here. Kirk, maybe we should split up. I go right, you go left. ne of us has got to find the way out. Girls, listen. Grom is letting us walk out of here. This is our chance for getting out. We'd better go while we can. You can go if you want to. I'll stick with Grom. Grom, where do we meet up? Back here at these trolleys. h, God, God. I didn't see. I'm sorry, really. I didn't see you. Olga, Olga. How could Ol...? Hold on, Olga. Hold on. You'll be okay. Oh, God. I couldn't see her. I couldn't see her. Olga. What happened? Oh, no, Olga. It was an accident. It was dark. I thought it was him and she just suddenly came out of nowhere. Came out of nowhere? Grom gave you that gun so you could protect us. And what did you do? You bastard! Get out of here. Grom? Grom? You bitch. Then let Grom save you for all I care. I'm getting out while I'm still able. Screw you! Fire, light for once. Fire, fire, come on. No, don't. No, don't. No, don't. No, don't. No, don't. No, don't, no. Come on, hurry. We've got to meet Kirk. This way. Watch yourself. Come on. Here, hold this. Watch your head. Hey, can you walk? Oh my God. Look, it's gonna be all right. Grom! Help me! Grom! Grom, help! Grom! Katya, Katya, give me your hand! Hurry, reach out your hand. -All right, go ahead. -I can't. Okay, I'll go first. Grom! Grom! Grom! Please, hurry! Hurry. Hurry. -Where is everyone? -They're dead. -Shit. -Glad you're alive. I saw him. I'm pretty sure he's alone. He doesn't have any weapons. I found a way out, but he's blocked it. I got an idea. We'll smash through the gate. We'll ram the trolley through it. I think it could be our only chance. -How about we use the grenade? -We'd better. -Let me. -Are you okay? Yeah. He's close. I thought I got him, but I think he survived. I found Splint's motorcycle. Watch out! Run! Go. You will never take my eyes. Go ahead, jump on. Katya! Katya. Katya. Katya. Katya. Oh, shit. Hey, you. Hey, asshole. Where's the girl? Where is she? If anything happens to her I'm gonna tear you to pieces. You hear me, you fucking freak? Grom! Come on, hurry. The motorcycle over there! Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.
