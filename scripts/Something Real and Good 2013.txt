Passengers on flight 435, service to Chicago, the flight has been delayed due to severe weather and is now scheduled to depart at 11:35pm. Once again, flight 435 service to Chicago will now depart at 11:35pm. What? What? No, really. What? I should be the one saying what. You were watching me. Was I? Yeah. Hmm. While I was reading my book, I thought if I gave you a sort of a glance and looked amused you might be impressed. Impressed? With a glance? Well, I tried to make it charming or coy or maybe both. I'm not really sure at this point. What more do you want? Do you know any tricks? What kind of tricks are you looking for? I don't know. Like carney tricks or... slight of hand, something like that. Maybe juggling. Would it really matter if I knew carney tricks? Glad we had this talk. Hmm-mm. Diary? No. Journal? No. Then what is it? You know, stuff. Stuff? Well, now I know. What? It's got all your secrets. Why do you rub the lining of your jacket? I noticed you over in the ticketing line rubbing the lining of your jacket. Guess I could ask you why you feel the need to talk to strangers? It's a human need I suppose. So that's what you do when you're pretending to read? Come up with things to say that might sound profound and... wait for someone to say them to? No. Sometimes, when I'm not reading, but pretending to be. All right, listen. I have a little black notebook that I write them down in and... I find strangers to test them out on. How's that working out for you? Usually better. But see, there was this girl down there earlier, she just would not get onboard. It's a tough nut to crack. Not that I'm into nuts or anything as I'm extremely allergic to peanuts. You're crazy. Crazy good or crazy bad? Crazy ba... good. But good? Yes. The jury's still out. I'll let you know when they come back with a verdict. All right. I can work with that. You know what else I can work with? Coffee. Coffee? Yeah, let's get some. Now? Yes. With you? Yes. No. All right, listen. I am desperate for human contact. I've spent the last two years mining for precious metals in the Western hills of Sierra Leone with my mute companion named Becky. It is a pleasure to meet you This is where you reciprocate. I usually tell people I'm a drummer in an all girl punk band. But I'm not. I love travel-sized accouterments and... I'm a wizard at parallel parking. Oh, and I'm not jaded. I'm depressed. Super. Strangers no more. Let's go get some coffee. It's just the mixture of me and coffee. It's... I get really, uh... I have this sense of immediacy that all of the spaces in my mind have got to be filled, but all the world is there for me to consume and envelop. It's mine to crack open and spill into my hands, but if I don't do it now nothing will ever be mine. What I want, what I need, all I see, now, now, now. I see I've momentarily forgotten how to function. So, maybe I should go. What were you saying earlier? I don't know. Oh. Something about the immediate need for Self-fulfillment. How's it working out for you? Kind of feels like it's not. Welcome to your 20's. How old are you? So what you're saying is when I turn 27, I can get smug and all knowing? I don't claim to know everything. You act like you do. It's a common misconception. How old are you? You're just a little niblet. A niblet? Yeah. Young. Like corn? Corn? Why are you talking about vegetables? You called me a niblet. Oh, right. Corn niblets. Tell me something. Something? Yeah. Something real. Something real. I had this blanket when I was a kid that had satin all around the edges, and I used to rub the satin in between my fingers, you know, just between my fingers all the time. That's why I rub the lining of my jacket. It reminds me of the satin. That wasn't so hard. I guess. I just don't like the whole revealing myself process all that much. Afraid people won't like what they see? No. Afraid they will? Aha. That I am afraid, that you're gonna have to tell me something. Something good. Fair enough. My first true love was Gwen Stefani. Gwen Stefani? Hell yeah. I'm just a girl. That song rocked! You know she was like a little punk, you know? And when she would get on stage, she'd just jump around like she was possessed by something. She led me to steal for the first time. She made you steal? I was in the store in the mall, and there was this little poster of her on stage completely possessed. And I had to have it. I mean I had to take it for myself. I mean I had the money for it, but it wasn't about buying. She wanted me to take her. So, I did. I've never stolen anything before. Not even like a pack of gum? Not even. How is that even possible? I don't know. I was kind of a goody-goody growing up. Let's go steal some shit. No. Yeah. Be part of your life education. How? It's good to grow. No. I can't. Here, put this in your pants. No, are you crazy? What's the problem? What am I gonna do with a travelling compass? Does it matter? Well, it should be useful Well, it should be useful, shouldn't it? No. Okay, fine. It will help you along your path in these crazy days of life we live. All right, all right. Take these tampons if you're so into practicality. Hey, why don't you just let me pick something? You're getting a little overexcited. Fine. Pick something yourself. Thank you. I mean honestly, is this how Gwen's poster spoke to you, because... Feeling a little excluded, aren't you? Maybe. 'cause I could use some help. You don't mean that. Of course I do. Yeah? Yes. I need a wingman, and I think you are the man for my wing. Now we're talking. All right, what's my handle? What are you? A trucker? No, but if we're gonna be covert, we can't use our real names. Fine. I'm Cher, you're Dion. Why can't I be Cher? 'cause you're the sidekick in this operation. Touche. I need you to neutralize Elton. Done. Great. Wait. Who's Elton? The creeps old lady over at the register. Cake. So, Peggy, what do you do when you're not working at Zene's & Things? You seem like you'd be into... Well that sounds very interesting. Good day, madam. Hey, hey. What did you get? What the hell is that? It's a koosh ball. A koosh ball? Yeah. You think that's more useful than a travelling compass? Yeah. It spoke to me. Time out. Time out. So, are we tight now? Oh, yeah. We're an open book. I tried. I mean, I'm not all that interesting really. I mean what's to know? I don't know. Stuff. Well, I don't know you. So, like, telling you stuff would be weird. That's weird. Why? Why? Just is. No it's not. You just said it was. I didn't. Yes you did. Okay, I did. You interest me. Okay. I wanna crack your head open and see what's inside. It's filled with candy corn, psycho. See? That's interesting. What? Sarcasm as a deflection mechanism. Is that your armchair psychology? I prefer pocket philosopher. Interesting. Intriguing. Indubitably. Passengers on flight 435 service to Chicago, we'd like we'd like to thank you for your patience this evening and apologize for the delay. We will now begin boarding at gate 35. What row are you in? Me too. No way. Wait, what seat are you in? Um, A. I'm in B. Get out of town. I am. Can I slap you? Why? Because I love the sound. It's so satisfying. How hard would you hit me? Oh, not too hard. Just enough to get a good whap. Okay. I guess. Damn, that sounded great! Treachery. You just slapped the shit out of me. Don't be such a little bitch about it. It hurt. Take it like a man. Legit, you're crazy. I think I like it. Don't get fresh. Thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. On the behalf of captain groom, the entire crew would like to welcome you onboard flight 435 service to Chicago. Our flight time will be four hours and ten minutes we are scheduled to land at 5:40 local time. You know what this is? Tell me. This is fate. That's what this is. We meet, make this connection, it can only be attributed to the Gods of divine connectionednesssion. Steal a koosh, and then... Well, and then, out of all the seats on this plane, our seats are exactly... You, dude. You're in my seat. Are you sure? Check it, sucker. Listen, I was hoping we could switch seats. Don't cockblock, dude. Let's go this way. Cockblock? What are you, like 10? Old enough to negotiate. As in bribery? No, extortion. How much? A hundo. Ha! Twenty. Done and done. How'd that go? We had a little tet-a-tet. I told him you'd shank him with a plastic spork. So, you mean he swindled you? Like a little bitch. It's a little premature don't you think? Touche. Small acts of defiance, you know? Right. So, where are you connecting to? I'm going to North Carolina. Going home or leaving home? Well, both I guess. I mean I'm going to my parent's house, which used to be my house, but Los Angeles's my home now. So, I guess you could say I'm leaving home and going home at the same time. I like that. Sounds more poetic than it really is. Don't do that. What? Don't not let yourself be profound. Well, okay. I won't not. Good. Aren't you gonna ask me? Ask you what? About my connection. So, I was wondering what's your connecting flight? New York. Why didn't you just fly direct? It's cheaper this way. I'd love to be able to afford to fly direct. It's almost like a novelty, you know? Flying directly from one place to another. I don't know. I kind of like connecting. I get a weird joy from being in airports. Direct. First class. It'd be like a dream. Have you ever been to first class? I got bumped one time. It was amazing. I think I was born for first class. Everyone thinks they're born for first class. What were we talking about before I started talking about first class and then I talked too much? Ur, connecting flights. Right. New York. Leaving home or returning home? Returning. Why were you in LA? I was visiting a friend. A lady friend? A man friend. You homo. Don't worry. I'm accepting. A hetero man friend. I'm not one of the gays. Ugh, must you call them the gays? No need to get homophobic. I'm not homophobic. Some of my best... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me guess. You're gonna tell me that some of your best friends are gay? That's what racist people say. Some of my best friends are black people. Some of my best friends are gay people. Some of my best friends are Buddhist midgets with no arms people. What? Well, I mean it's an easy claim to make. I actually don't know a Buddhist midget, let alone one with no arms, but I can claim to be best friends with one, now, can't I? Tangenting again, aren't I? Yeah. Where were we? Visiting my man friend. Right. How was it? Anti-climatic. Why so? Well, we're not friends like we used to be. It's one of the things you don't really realize until you're there, you know? It's like on the phone you both can pretend it's the same, like you're still friends in the real sense. But then you get face to face and... That's sad. Such is life. I suppose. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We have just been informed that the snow has picked up again in Chicago. Visibility is too low for us to land. So, we've been rerouted to Denver where we will be grounded until tomorrow morning. Airline representatives will be available to assist you on rebooking your flight and will help you arrange for a hotel. We greatly apologize for the inconvenience. We'll be landing at 2:30am local Denver time. Snow? Snow. Denver? Denver. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey what? Hey, listen. Hey, listen to what? Hey, listen. Please, tell me what's in that black notebook. I don't want to. You have to. Why? Because I asked politely. I suppose you did. Yes, I did. Thanks. Well, I guess I fancy myself a writer. You guess? No, I fancy myself a writer. You fancy? Ugh, leave me alone. Well, I'm just trying to figure out if you're guessing about how you fancy yourself a guess or if you're a writer? I'd like to be a writer. Do you write? Well, yeah. So, you're a writer. I guess. Why? I guess I just feel self-conscious talking about it. You know what I want? What? I wanna feel awake. Have a coffee. I mean metaphorically. Maybe an espresso would be best. Perhaps a cappuccino? No? Maybe a cafe au lait? Are you belittling me? No. Just tryna call you out on your bullshit. Thanks. That and help you espress yourself. Say what? Espress yourself. I'm sorry. Again, please. Espresso self. 816, 817, So, what are you gonna do now? Like right now? Yeah. Now, now. Well, I'm gonna brush my teeth, maybe contemplate life, You know, the usual. Well, all right. Good luck with that. Probably just gonna ponder the cosmos. Well, okay. That's that... What time is your flight tomorrow? 7:30. Mine's at 8. What shuttle are you gonna take? Probably the one at 6. I probably will too. So, I'll see you in the morning. I guess you will. Well, I guess this is good night. I guess it is. Good night. Hello. Hello. God? Yes, my child. Oh, hey. What are you doing? Contemplating life. Did you brush your teeth? I did. Was it marvelous? It was. You wanna come over and watch some TV? In heaven? Otherwise known as room 825. I'll be there shortly. Well, I look forward to your arrival. Why thank you. You're quite welcome. You like that movie? Sure, it's sweet. It's movies like that that fuck real life and real love. How? They perpetuate these insane ideas about love and the idea of it. What do you mean? Well... it's like we'll never be satisfied with real life love because movies have led us to believe that love is lived out in a never-ending montage. They make it into this magical thing it's just gonna somehow solve all your problems. Maybe it is. Maybe it does. But does it really exist? In real life? I'm not so sure it does. I mean maybe it does, but my parents never really had it, so maybe it's just that I haven't had a glimpse of it. Or maybe that's not the point. Maybe the point is, is that life and love will never be as easy, or glamorous or exciting as it is in the movie. That was quite a little rant you just went on there. Yeah, I guess it was. Are you feeling any better now? I mean, do rants really ever make you feel any better? It's not their purpose really. Are you a divorce baby? A what? You know, child of a broken home. I'm not. Actually, my parents are still married. My anger just comes naturally. Fair enough. Are yours? Divorced? They are. Yeah? Yeah. Guess you could chalk it up to having too much passion. So, they had it? They did. Didn't do them a lot of good though. Kind of cracked under the pressure of it. But I mean at least you've seen it. I mean my parents just bickered and were in this marriage where I never really felt like they were in love. They just sort of kept it going I guess for my brother and me, which was very noble of them, But I don't know. Sometimes I think they ruined marriage for me. That's a grand statement. I know. Sometimes I'm scared to say it out loud because I'm afraid my parents will hear me somewhere across the Miles. And I don't wanna hurt them like that. But at the same time I just don't think marriage works for anyone. Well, maybe it does, but it's just not for you. So, you're saying you think marriage can work? No. I'm saying maybe it's just not for you. Maybe you're right. I mean who am I to say something as broad as that. It just seems like our generation's parents are either divorced or unhappy or both. I mean, look at you. Your parents are divorced. Doesn't that fuck you up? Well, them being divorced hasn't fucked me up quite as much as the actual divorce did. Well, how so? Well, I mean we were little my brother and I. I was six and he was eight. So, I don't know how much this is actually coming from my own memory or from what I was told later what happened, but... my brother and I were assets to my dad. Another thing he could fight my mom for. Just to hurt her. Just to win, you know? And did he? Win I mean? It's nothing you haven't heard from any other tale of divorce woe. All our stories are the same. Half our generation's fucked up from divorce. Or lack of. And I was just sort of nodding like it was all so completely understandable. Wasn't it? Well, she was all, "my heart is broken." And it really fucking bothered me. Why? The way people talk about a broken heart is ridiculous, like it's a tangible object, something you could hold or sit on a shelf, could bring your friends over and say, "look at here what I got on my knickknack shelf. It's the two pieces of my broken heart. Would you like to hold them?" It just makes it all seem like bullshit. Have you ever been in love? No. So, you've never had your heart broken? Well, no. Hmm. What? Just awfully critical of something you know nothing about. Oh, please. I reserve the right to be cynical. How is that possible anyway? That you've never been in love? I don't know. I'm just better at being alone. Actually, not better because I've never been bad at together, because I've never actually been that together with a person. You never know. You might like it. Do you like it? I do. Do tell why. Well, it's hard to talk about love without sounding trite. Well, do it anyway. Talking about love is like trying to put words to something you can't define. You're right. That was pretty trite. I mean, here I am, young and naive in the ways of love and you have nothing to throw at me but cliche. Now you're going to die. I think maybe we've been in this room too long. Maybe. We should leave this place. We could. We will find sustenance. We will? Yes, we will. Hi, there. How may I burger you? Pardon? How may I burger you? I'm sorry. What? I didn't write it, but I'm required to say it. How's that working out for you? Look, man, let's not torture the 20-year-old college student who's flipping burgers to pay his parents rent money because they refuse to let him live in their basement for free. Do you really live in your parent's basement? Well, then... I think I'll get the number one. I think I'm gonna go with number four. No, one. No, four. One, no, four. One. No, four. Four. Four, please. And can I have some ketchup with that? Anything else? Uh, no. I think that's about it. Thank you. I mean I want to love things. What? Just because I've never been in love doesn't mean I don't want to. Just not sure I'll ever get to. What are you talking about? You've never felt like that? Like nothing will ever be yours? You can love something without it being yours. No, you can't. You've been burgered. I'm sorry, what? Burgered. Pardon? What? You want me to be anorexic? Well, you may wanna actually breathe while you eat. You might wanna wipe that ketchup off your chin. Higher. Lower. Lower again. Higher again. No, let me get it. I'll never wash this cheek again. Oh, what a wicked web we weave. What? The web that we weave. It's kind of wicked. Don't you think? I don't know if I'd use the word wicked, per se. Or web for that matter. But whatever it is, we've definitely weaved it. I think you're right. We did weave it. Do you know how to weave? No. Yeah, me either. Maybe that's why we're so unhappy. Because we can't weave? Yeah. I mean we spend all our time reminiscing about what we've weaved, but we don't know how to weave. So, we've really weaved nothing. Ipso facto we're reminiscing about nothing. My God, that's brilliant. Thank you. Did you just come up with that? I did. Good for you. Thank you. Have you ever felt nostalgic for something without knowing what you're nostalgic for? Like what? I just... I don't know. Something about interstate exits. Interstate exits? Yeah. My family never really flew all that often. We always drove. Always. It was this really well practiced routine. I'd remember specific exits, know what gas station we went to, and what fast food restaurant we stopped at. And for some reason I miss it. I mean maybe it's just the neon going straight to my brain, but I miss this when I shouldn't really. It's just some exit off of some interstate. I could really be anywhere. There's a small amount of romance to that. Like the idea that everywhere seems a little bit familiar. Kind of like home. Yeah. I guess. But it's also kind of depressing that you can never go anywhere new. There's all these trips in my life that I remember in mile markers and exit signs. Gas, food, lodging. The options were always the same. But there was this weird sort of comfort in knowing that if you pass an exit with something you wanted, no worries. Just go a few more exits and you'll find it again. Maybe that's what I miss, you know? Feeling that you can never miss out on something. Maybe you're just nostalgic for childhood. Could be. Maybe it's just past your bedtime. I think it is. Do you ever think that you think too much? Because I think that all the time. but not that thinking is a bad thing. It's just the incessant thinking about what I'm thinking about, and how it makes me think of things that I don't wanna think about. What are you thinking about? About how I'm thinking. No, I'm just kidding. I'm thinking about how I can't seem to get through a day without feeling nostalgic about my past or nostalgic for some future I haven't even lived and probably never will. That makes me sad. Like lives you know you'll never live, but would like to? Exactly. I feel that too. I always wish there could be like six of me and we all lived these different lives, but had a collective memory bank we shared. Or if you could live one life by day and another by night. So, you go to bed in one life and you transport to say Russia and you live your life there. Then you go to bed in Russia and immediately wake up here. Exactly. But I mean not Russia. No, of course not. I'd look terrible in a babushka. And I hate in vodka. Ugh. We talk too much. Legit... such assholes. I mean seriously where do we get off taking up so much oxygen? That's it. It's cold out here. Let's go explore some shit. Nice. Where do you suppose those doors lead? I don't know. Let's find out. Okay. Let's go in. Are you sure about this? What are you scared of? What if they catch us in there? I am seriously questioning you right now. Why? I thought you had balls. You wish, homo. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Oh my God. I'm honored. I'm so honored. Ah, let me think. I'd like to thank the academy. What an honor! I mean, I'm honored. And to my fellow nominees, you inspire me. And last not but not least, my parents for the acting class when I was two. You can never start too early. Thank you. Thank you all. I love the world. Wait, stop the music. Just stop! I forgot to thank my best friends. My agent, my publicist, and my lawyer. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. I wish I could be happy with something simple. Like a farm with some animals. Maybe some sheep that I shear, weave my fabric on an old-fashioned loom, and be happy doing that. You'd like to shear sheep? Not literally. Actually, I'm strangely frightened by sheep. I just mean something like that, you know? Simpler way of life. Yeah, but it'd probably suck. But maybe I'd be happy. Do you believe that? Yes. No. Fuck. I don't know. It's just that I've decided what to do with myself because it's what I want, but I can think of nothing worse than chasing after something you've always wanted, and then realizing it doesn't make you happy even after you struggled to get it. Yeah, but how do you know you're gonna hate it once you get there? I don't know. Maybe I won't. But it's what I want at 23. By the time I get there, I won't be 23 anymore, which makes me think I'm always gonna want what I want now. Can you tell me something? I'm a little worried. Why? I'm sensing you're no longer looking for amusement. Maybe I'm not. What are you looking for? Enlightenment. Cute. Thanks. You've been saving that one, haven't you? I have. For how long? A couple hours. Now seemed right. So, I threw it out there. Right. You know what I'm tryna do with my possibly insignificant life. It's not my fault you caved so easily. Okay, could you check your self-loathing at the door for maybe the next I don't know two minutes? What? Enough with the game of mystery. Just fucking tell me. Jeez. I am... I am... absolutely nothing. Come on. Just tell me. I am a trust fund. How do you like me now? So, you're rich? You could say that. Like really rich? Well, I can't say I'm completely okay with it. Probably because I'm somewhat jealous, but besides that, I mean it can't be so bad to be rich. Now can it? It's not bad. It's great. It's fucking awesome. Then why are you so upset about having money? I mean everybody wants it. You've got it. Why am I upset? Because I'm a waste of human flesh. 'cause I'm fucking weak. 'cause instead of a spine I've a birthright. Take your pick. I'll go with birthright. That one sounds intriguing. Oh, you're intrigued? Well, yeah. I mean, ooh, secret identity Kind of intrigued. It's no secret or anything. I mean this money was made before there was a me. I thought I hated it. I thought I could hate it. I really thought I could live without my parent's money. I had all these great intentions of just walking away. But I tell myself, "self, you don't need this. Let's live. Let's see if we can just cut the rope away." Romantic, right? It's got some romance to it. So, I decided to go on a spiritualistic journey where I could actually do something on my own without my parent's money for once. I decided to become a real old-fashioned troubadour. A troubadour? Fancy. I like it. Well, I don't know if you could actually technically refer to it as a troubadour when you finance it with trust fundage. Oh. Yeah. That's where the weak part comes in. Apparently, cutting the net takes a stronger knife than what I was using. You need like a serrated blade or a pocketknife even. And you are? Butter knife. Really dull butter knife. It's kind of like cutting with a spoon come to think of it. Hell, it probably was a spoon. So, there you were. Troubadour with a spoon. Graduated from college and I moved to San Francisco because it was kerouacian. I started using the money right away. Just small amounts. Then I used more of it. And then I forgot to forget about the money. Well... so, what is that you're doing in New York? Eating with a spoon. Oh. Yeah. Silver one? I believe it may be. How's it taste? A little bitter. Kind of like crow. I heard that's an acquired taste. What? Crow? Yeah, I'm still working on that one. So, you aren't doing anything? Not really. What do you wanna do? I don't know. Well, there must be something. I'm kind of at this point of in between. It's like I know I can do anything. I mean I really believe that. It's just when I think about actually doing it, I'm petrified. Guess I'm just kind of in a holding pattern. Well, why don't you just, I don't know, do something? I mean if I pick something, I'll have to finally really define myself. That scares me, 'cause there's nothing I really wanna be. When I ask you what's the world, you're gonna raise your spoon and say, "my fucking oyster," and then I'm gonna ask you, "and whatcha you looking for?" and you're gonna say, "my fucking pearl." You ready? Ready. What's the world? My fucking oyster. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. My fucking oyster! Come on, get excited about it. Make it an exclamation. Okay? What's the world? My fucking oyster! Whatcha looking for? My fucking pearl! There you fucking go! I like to brush my teeth in the shower. Me too. I like travel sized accouterments. I know. You do? Yeah, you told me already when we first met. I tend to repeat stories. Occupational hazard. What occupation is that? Being forgetful. Ah, yes. I've got something. Yeah? You know that feeling you get when you stretch your arm out the car window and the wind catches under your fingers and your hand just seems to float there with all the air rushing around it? That makes me feel free. I wish I could live up inside that feeling. Just right up inside it. Takes a lot to impress you. What? It's probably 'cause you're jaded. Just because I'm not easily impressed doesn't mean I'm jaded. You know I think it does actually. You've got me all wrong. You think so? I do. Tell me, what impresses you? I'm impressed... by someone who holds my attention. Ha! So, you admit you're easily distracted. Shit. No, that's not what I meant. I mean, someone who can make me laugh or... who I don't have to pretend to be completely interested in. Or, holy shit. I'm completely self-absorbed. But we all are, aren't we? I mean, don't we all just really care about ourselves? Not necessarily. I mean there's people who go to third world countries and help poverty stricken children learn to read, or help build homes after earthquakes, shit like that. I hate when people spew that altruistic bullshit. They don't go there to build a house, they go there so when they get back they can tell everyone about how they built a house. It's like they're better than everyone else or some shit. My God you're cynical. And you aren't? Well, I prefer disenchanted. Disenchanted? Yes. By what? Everything. You're mocking me. I am, but in good fun. And was it? What? Fun? Well, I thought it would be, but now I'm sensing it might not end so well. It might not. Look, I was only kidding. Whatever. It's fine. I guess it's just one of those things where you can insult yourself, but you never really believe it until you hear it from someone else. I can't seem to stop hiding behind sarcasm and irony and mock sincerity. I hide from real emotions or I hide from talking about them, because I'm afraid of the embarrassment or self-loathing it could cause. It's as if I'm afraid to take myself seriously. And sometimes I hate myself for that. People are cheesy every day and they don't care. They gush about puppies and rainbows and they like it. I mean maybe they don't know they're being cheesy, and... they think of it as being deep. But maybe they do realize it and they do it anyway because they wanna feel. And they don't care what people will think about that. There are days when I wish I could just be one of them, smiling at a rainbow. I've been uncomfortably numb to emotion for quite some time now. Doesn't that make you sick? Sometimes when I really think about it. And how often do you do that? I think you know. I do. Say it anyway. Constantly. All day, every day, my friend. What if we start now? You and me. We'll be emotional and honest all the time. What are you saying? I'm saying maybe we decide to make some sort of true effort to be cliched, filled with honesty and emotion. And we agree, you and me, to smile and to sing and to believe. And we ditch our cynicism and we're happy all the time. And we throw away our need to be tragic because... tragedy doesn't go well with the colors of our new self. And every morning we smile because we're alive. I mean, we're young and we're open, and there's no one that's gonna stop us. Except maybe ourselves. Valid concern. I think I hate us. Let's kill us off. Should we? We'll put an end to our self-inflicted misery. I like that. And in our place we'll live our new self. But how do we get rid of us? Going to need a chariot. Get on. Ready? Ginger ale for the lady. I'd adore a ginger ale. Why does our thought process have to be so random? What do you mean? Well, I'm drinking this ginger ale, but you can't just drink a ginger ale. Suddenly, I'm thinking about how this ginger ale affects me. Tell me. It's nothing really. Look at the cart. We agreed. Ginger ale makes me think of my grandma. She used to pour a little into her water. It was about one quarter ginger ale and three quarters Water. That's how she drank it. And then it gets really random. Do you believe in reincarnation? Can't really say that I do. Yeah, me neither. 'cept for when I think of my grandma. Yeah? Yeah. I always felt like she knew me before there was a me to know, you know? Like when I was little, I would catch her looking at me in this way, and I would just smile at her, just happy without thought. And maybe I thought it was just love, but... when I remember that look, she was not looking through me, but inside of me, to another part of me. I like to believe she was thinking of the me I would become. Like she knew who that was, because she'd seen it before. She was just waiting for me. I guess I just felt like we knew each other from more than the time we've had together. We were connected without effort for longer than I can remember. So, maybe there really are these other lives that we live and we see people again. Or maybe it's just me leaning on mysticism because I can't stand the idea that I might never see her again. Maybe it's just me being weak. Oh, don't say that. You know, I can't remember a single instance of her yelling at me or getting angry at me ever. She would just look at me and I would... feel disappointment pouring from her eyes because... 'cause she knew there was better in me. And this is me crying. How is it? Well, I mean I'm crying. I don't really cry in front of people. That was a nugget for me. Can I tell you that was a nugget of you that I wanna keep? You wrap it up, save it in a little box. one that's small enough to fit in my pocket. Is that okay with you? If you want. I do. Made me believe that we should believe in mysticism. Believing mysticism doesn't have to be a bad thing. It doesn't. I desperately wanna believe that there's a secret to world, just so that I know it exists. And I will love it without really knowing what it is I'm loving, just so I can breathe it in, you know? Do you know? I'd like to. I think you do, unconsciously. Is that possible? Who are you? No, really. Who are you? I don't know. I don't either. We're gonna have to leave soon. Yeah, soon. I like you. Yeah? Yeah. That was really hard for me to say. I like you too.
