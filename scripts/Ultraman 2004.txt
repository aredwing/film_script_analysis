Yeah. You're a born Eagle pilot. Why resign? I made up my mind. How old is Tsugumu? My boy? Almost six. Time flies. I feel like he was born only yesterday! The older, the faster. Hey, who's an old man? Maki, aren't we selected people? Aren't we special people that concentrate on... flying fighters in tough conditions? Yet you're leaving. Won't you regret? I first saw a fighter... when I was seven. I was visiting a relative's house. When on my way fishing, I got lost and passed by an air force base. It was terrific. The wings were shining in the sun. It looked like a silver meteor. A silver meteor? That determined my life. My dream was to become a fighter pilot... and I did. Then why? It's my boy. He might not live until seven. Is he that ill? The doctor clearly said that, if he got sick again, he won't... live more than a year. My dream came true. So now I want to spend more time with my family. So now I want to spend more time with my family. No new flight information yet? No, sir. It's totally unknown. The scramble plane's taking off. Tsugumu, Dad'll be late. Go to bed now. Mom, Dad's not flying an Eagle anymore? What? How come? We'll talk about it when he's back. I'll read you a book. Go to bed. Radar contact... Is it really a plane? What's wrong? The meters have gone crazy! Go back immediately! But... You might crash. Leave it to me. Sorry, Maki. Perch position. I'll see it soon. I've lost it. I won't die. Never! I can't die. Not yet. What's that? This is the rescue squad. We're here. The F15 blew up in the mountains. No private houses around. Repeat: The plane blew up. No houses around. The pilot's survival unknown. Repeat: The pilot's survival unknown... That's right. No news from the base yet... I had a scary dream... Tsugumu woke up. I'll call you back. Was it Grandma? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I mean it. Everything's fine. A plane crashed in the mountains nearby. Can you see some fire out there, Yukie? What's wrong? Your phone... May I use your phone? Oh, dear! Call an ambulance! Shunichi... Yoko... I...? Stay in bed. I'll call a nurse. Tell me... What happened to me? Tsugumu... So you're okay. I'M sorry, Tsugumu... We checked thoroughly. We found nothing wrong. You are in perfect condition. Not a bone was broken in that accident. It's a miracle. A miracle? Give your name and rank. Shunichi Maki, 1st Lt. Very well. Remember how the accident happened? Yes, sir. Tell us about it... in detail. Yes, sir. It was October 15, 2-1-0-5 We received a scramble request. I took off with Captain Kurashima's plane. We flew 30,000 feet high. Bearing: 202. Two minutes later, Captain Kurashima got an engine trouble. I don't understand. What about that red luminous body? My memories of it may be vague and uncertain, but... Maki, Forget it. Yes, this incident sure is mysterious. The engine trouble, the luminous body, and... My miraculous return. Right. That's the biggest mystery. But, whatever happened, you are still alive. Just listen. When you were about to resign, you were almost killed in that accident. But you've returned alive. I'M glad at that. It pleases me the best. Monster... Is this area blocked off? Yes, sir. But we haven't found it yet. The crew...? All dead, sir. It looks like... a savage beast rampaged. A savage beast? It's much worse than that. Thank you very much. Be careful on the way home. Sir, the boss wants you. Ippei, don't "Sir" me, please. Why not? I'm a newcomer here. You've been here three years. "Sir" sounds odd. But want to. Three years are nothing. What counts are skills. Don't you say that. It's true, isn't it? Boss, the photographers left. Oh really? Thanks. How's work? I'm getting used to it, thank you. Good. I took your words to heart. "What civilians need most is... to care for safety." There is a big difference between fighters and Cessnas. No sudden turns and stuff. It's rather monotonous and boring. Monotonous? Every day is full of surprises now that I can stay with my family. Surprises? I'm all alone when flying a fighter. I see. Here's another surprise then. Sorry? Tsugumu's coming here with his mother. Really? Only a short flight in the afternoon. You can be back by 3. Fly with your family after that. Your flight plan is made. It's a birthday gift for your boy. Thank you, boss. See you later! Maki's hot. An ex-air force man, but he seems very kind. Handsome, too. Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Maki. He'll give you a lift later. It's so fast! A nose dive! You a magazine reporter? The sky's clear. You're lucky. And... That doesn't matter. What's important is you, A military chopper! Why? Just do as I say. At least tell me where we're headed. Go straight for 12km. We'll land on Cape Ryu. Wait a minute. There's no runway there. We blocked off a highway for 1km. Landing on a highway? Are you crazy? Easy for you, ex-Eagle pilot. We are BCST. An anti-bio terrorism organization... working with the U.S. Forces. A national organization behind all this? That means extreme emergency. Who are you? She's our scientist. She planned this. My name is Sara Mizuhara. Hi. Where am I? Why bring me here? Not on your radar, either? Are you sure? Very well. Thanks. Not a single clue yet. That means... Ippei! Sorry. Boss! Maki's Cessna is back! Contact us before you land! We were so worried! Maki... Mr. Kurashima! How have you been? Who are you guys? Let me tell you. We've been watching you for a month. Been watching me? Let us explain. Three months ago, a UFO fell in the Pacific Ocean. The Navy investigated it. One of its deep sea boats disappeared. It was found, completely destroyed. Only Udo, its operator, survived. He testified that... an unknown, blue luminous body destroyed the boat. A blue luminous body? In short, what happened to you... had also happened at the Pacific Ocean bottom. Show him that picture. A week after Udo's return, we took a picture of him at a lab. Look at him. What has he...? The luminous body changed him genetically. And he escaped... from the lab. Escaped? He absorbed lizards to... use its abilities. He evolves, taking in other creatures. We let such a terrible monster get away. So... What did you see? Something was... killing soldiers. As if to hunt animals, it slaughtered them. Stop! That's enough. No mistake? An early stage of change. Wait a minute. Don't tell me... Your senses become abnormally sharp. It happened to Udo too. Are you saying that... I'm turning into a monster, too? That's why we watched you... and captured you. A sick joke! I'm different. I'm just a human. Then... how come you saw the slaughter? You saw what The One saw. "The One?" That's the monster's code name? How will you call me, then? "Next"...maybe. Tell me. Where is my husband? Due to... a special reason, he's at the Defense Agency. "A special reason?" I can't explain yet, but it's... A national defense matter. No more questions. Do as we say. "A national defense?" He's no longer a soldier. He works here now. You can't touch him. That's right. Tell them, Boss! Confirm that he is in safety. Right now! If you don't do as we say, it'll jeopardize both of us. Tsugumu... Why doesn't Dad come home? Tsugumu... He will return. I guarantee you. Mr. Kurashima... Go home for tonight. Please. Let me contact my family! Let me tell them I'm okay. Take him away. Come. Go in. Why me? Why? Why?! We're ready. We're on stand-by. Who'll take responsibility if he doesn't appear? I believe the prediction recorded at the lab. I will eliminate The One without fail. Again! That sense is... coming up again. He's coming. He's coming... here. He senses The One. He does. The sensor's activating. The target's in Block A3. The target's moving to the trap point. I'll go. Squads 1 and 2, spread! Squad 3, on stand-by. Are you sure that... this will get rid of him? It's been tested. It'll definitely kill him. Good. He's... after me. He's trying... to kill me. The target's approaching the trap point! Ready to fire! Let me out! Let me out of this place! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Fire! The light! No! Explain! He became immune to poison. He's improving himself. Retreat! Retreat! Go! Run! Hurry! So... you are here. You are... in my way. So... I'll kill you. He's transforming, too! In pain? I see. You haven't yet... completely merged. Who are you? And why...? You came to, eh? What happened? Don't you remember? The One attacked you. It transformed you. Then... that wasn't a dream after all. Scared? You turn into something inhuman. That scares you. The terror is... removed only by death. You knew, didn't you? That it'd be drawn to me and appear. You used me to lure him. That's right. So what? While at the lab, Udo predicted another victim would follow him. From the sky... another light will come. Light? Yes. It will come... after me. What? What's so funny? It'll be in the way. So... I'll kill it. And... I became a monster! You going to kill me first? No. I'll wait a little longer. Why? You... saved my life. That surprised me. Udo became such a ferocious monster. But you could control yourself. Maybe "Next" is not our target to kill. Not now, at least. In short, you think I'm a useful monster. Will you help? Use your power to kill him. What if... I say no? There'll be more victims. Lots of them. Who left this tool box here? What's this? What's this? Yoko! How's Tsugumu? Better. He's asleep. He is? I phoned the base many times. Sorry. At your colleague's funeral, I finally realized I was a pilot's wife. But... Tsugumu's only five. He needs you. Even while unconscious, he kept calling for you. Yet... Well? Did you make up your mind? Why me? You've been selected. By some will, you were given... a special power to fight The One. Stop calling me Lieutenant. I'm not a soldier anymore. I resigned for my family. In a sense, I'm just another nobody. Why me, then? Why must I fight that monster? Why? I'm sorry. All I know is, we're in a critical situation. A poisonous gas case took place in Shinjuku. Details are not yet known. Some are still missing in the underground tunnel. Unbelievable. He's in Shinjuku! You drew what you wanted to be, right? Now I'll return those pictures. When I call you, answer loudly, and come to the front. Kosuke Aizawa... Is this a carpenter? Tsugumu Maki! What's this plane? F15J Eagle. Is that so? Do you want to be a pilot like your dad? Yeah. Hiroko Shibuya... Hey, mom... Did Dad quit for my sake? I don't think so. Did Dad say so? No. But... he looked happy talking about planes. I saw how much he liked Eagles. But... Dad loves you. Much more than fighters. That's why. Tsugumu... What's wrong? What is it? My boy's not well. What? Fire! Let's go! I'll get permission to kill him. Wait! Only he can kill The One. So... He's just a monster. We can't trust him. This is 01. Request permission to kill. Tsugumu... Connect me to Captain Kurashima. I must know if the wife and son are okay. Tsugumu! Mrs. Maki! Over there. How is Tsugumu? He's in there. He's still unconscious. I'm sure he'll make it. He's his dad's son. Right? Yes! Thank you. But... my boy has a congenital blood disease. If it's a case of that... Mrs. Maki... You must believe he'll make it. That's right. He'll be okay. He sensed his son was ill, and fled. He'll go there. T he goes there, what'll you do to him? You don't need to know that. An alarm's been given. The Army's evacuating inhabitants. It's like Shinjuku is under marshal law. What are you thinking? If I fight him... I might die. Please. Let me see my son. Just one glance. Let him go. Ten minutes. No more. Understood. Maki! Mister! Maki! I'm sorry. Yoko... How's Tsugumu? His blood is normal. There are no other unusual symptoms. Why'd he faint then? Probably psychological fatigue. We'll keep him overnight and leave him on a drip. Excuse me. He's still such a small kid. Tsugumu... I'll stay with you. I Won't go anywhere. I'm okay. Go to work. Tsugumu... Never mind my work. It does. Flying a plane has been your dream. I like the sky, too, so go to work. I'll try to get better, too. Then you'll give me a ride in your plane. Will you promise? I promise. Shunichi... Even it we quarreled, I smiled when you went off to fly. I always tried to do so. Now go. Be careful. I will. Goodbye. If you didn't return, I was going to kill The One myself. Even if I had to die. When his tail was cut in pieces, we used them to develop poisonous bullets. I'm not sure if they work. But it's worth trying. When you talk about him, you stifle your emotions. Is that your "supernatural power" again? I don't know. Just feels that way. Udo... was my lover. We'd have married. We'd have had a family like yours, too. A common but warm family. At that laboratory... I couldn't kill him. Are you... going to kill me? My mistake killed many people. I'll get him this time. No. That's... my job. What kept you so long? Are you under the Colonel's orders? That's right. Let's go. Hold it. Your mistake killed many of my men. I can't let you go. No more victims, but we need his help. Just one more time... trust us. Stand by for now. He's absorbed many creatures... and developed himself. What a grotesque form he must have... I can't even imagine. Tell me. What? I still have my conscience. What about him? Weren't we affected by the same light? No. He was affected by a different light. Two different lights. He got the bad one. He was unfortunate. It makes no sense, but it's fact. But, chances are... Sara... why are you here...? I Woke to find... I'm here. Tell me, what happened to me? I knew it. He still has human consciousness. It's just a monster using his body. Who is he? Sara, where... am I? You are... in heaven. Heaven? That's right. You are... already dead. Sara, you shot five times, but hit me only once. Aim more accurately. Tears clouding your eyes? Stupid girl! Goodbye, my dear! Die! You're in the way! I'll kill you all! You aren't human anymore. I won't... forgive you! You're in the way! What's that? Miku! You okay? You alright? This way! Hurry! I can fly. I can fly in the sky! It's amazing! It has wings. The monster is spreading its wings. What a grotesque sight! I don't know how to describe it. It looks like... Like... Demon... This is it. All alone. Piercing through the air. It's like I'm a light now. I'm like... a silver meteor. Burn! Burn all the humans! Is that all you got? My power's fading. Why? Your merger... isn't perfect. You should've eaten humans like did. You fool! Your body... can't endure more fighting. If I die... what'll happen to you? Probably... I shall die with you. What about the evil? No! I can't fall yet. No! I have a... promise to keep. I'll kill that evil. That is my... last mission. You still alive? Die! Don't shoot! Go round it! Maki! How quiet. Will I die this time? Maki... I needed your life... to fulfill my mission. That's alright. I realize now, meeting you was... my fate. Fate? We fighter pilots... cannot choose our planes. If our plane goes out of order... we'll die, no matter how good we are. But we regard that... as our fate. And we flew. Meeting you... I had the best flight ever. So... I have no regrets. Are you sure... you have no regrets? Just one. I couldn't keep my promise to my son. My regret is... that I couldn't fly with him. It's been a month since that nightmare. But the remnants of destruction are still everywhere. What impressed people more was that super human figure. He killed the monster and left. Who on earth was he? Will he appear before us again someday? Hoping for his return, children call out to him: "Ultraman." See you later! Be careful! Amazing! I'm really flying! You like it? Yeah. Thanks for keeping our promise. But... it wasn't only me... that helped to keep the promise. What? Who else? A friend of mine who went back to the sky. A friend? The silver meteor I dreamed of. Thank you... Ultraman. I like my dad as a pilot. When I grow up, I'll become a pilot like him. I want to fly in the sky, too. That's my dream.
