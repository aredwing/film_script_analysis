There were signs everywhere, but no one really saw it coming. These days... people can't see when they are preaching hatred. People can't hear when the gods are fighting each other. And eventually it all comes down to this city, where there is so much hatred, it runs deep into the ground, waking up the dead. In 1972, two priests from Jerusalem managed to capture this event. It was the first profound evidence. [MAN SPEAKING HEBREW] Three stars. That's when the Yom Kippur just started. The church got information about a local family. La familiae, Jewish, Muslim? - Jewish. - Jewish. - Are you filming this? - It's very important. They say it's a woman and that she came back. Excuse me, sir, can you tell the camera exactly what happened? [SPEAKING HEBREW] That thing is not my wife. She died of typhus three days before and was buried near Golgotha. While they were mourning, on the third night of the Shiva, the child heard a knock on the door. At the beginning, she was quiet and calm, but then she became violent. She hurt my father. [SHOUTING] Representatives from all three religions are here. This concerns all of us. - [WOMAN SHRIEKING] - [RABBIS CHANTING] They all believed in different gods, but on that night, they were all dealing with the same devil. For hours, they tried to help her, cure her. But evil was too strong in that woman. Go closer, quickly. They had no other choice. [SPEAKING HEBREW] [WOMAN GROANING] In the name of the Lord, return to the ground! [SHRIEKS] They say there are three gates to hell. On that night... we found one of them. - SARAHL: Dad! - DAD: Huh? I can't believe you. Oh, my God, no way. - What do you think? - You got me a smart glass? - Oh, my God. - You like it? Dad, I can't believe you. Wait. Look, I've already signed you in with your user name. - Did I put it on right? - You look great in them. - Oh, it's so cool! - It is cool. Dad, you're unbelievable. This is the touchpad, and you navigate with your finger like a mouse, and this is the memory card. I got you your prescription glasses, so basically you're all set. [GIGGLES] - It makes me look geeky, right? - What do you expect? You play those video games all day long. Dad, don't. Thank you, Daddy. Why don't you try 'em out? Glass, play music. DAD: Don't be long, all right? No tomorrow will get ready for me That's cool! Doesn't even know I'm here Dad, you're the best! Sitting staring in silence, leering fear Glass, stop music. Okay. Glass, open menu. No. Okay, games. Zombies? Oh, yeah. Hey, guys. - [MEOWS] - Cool it, Dexter. Here we go. [LAUGHS] This is so cool. - [GROWLS] - Die! Come to mama. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Take that, asshole. Die, motherfucker. [MUNCHING] Glass, open link. FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Looking for an exciting destination? Well, how about Tel Aviv? The nightlife is not something you see every day. The beach parties and the nightclubs offer a pretty wild experience. - For a minute there... - DAD: Sarah! SARAH: I'm here. Glass, close link. - You all packed? - Yes, Daddy. I just want to say goodbye. DAD: We've got to go get Rachel, so we better get going. SARAH: I'll be right up! DAD: Don't be long, sweetheart, okay? [CRYING] DAD: Sarah? Are you coming? We've got to get going. I'm coming! DAD: I'm happy that Rachel is taking you on this trip. You've had a rough year. - We all did. - Yeah. DAD: Oh, here's Rachel. - Whoo! - DAD: Hey, Rache. I can't believe it's happening! We're really going. - Hi, Mr. Pullman. - Are your parents home? No. They're off squandering my inheritance somewhere. - Come on, Drake, the bag. - SARAH: Come on, come on. - We're in a hurry. - I'm on it, baby. SARAH: I thought it was over between you two. DRAKE: Okay, baby. You're all set. Oh, my God, I'm going to miss you. Rache! Come on, guys, cut it out. - Come on. Get into the car. - I'm gonna miss you so much. Come on. Rache! - Bye, baby. - Bye, sweetie. - Get in the car already. - Bye, guys. - Bye, Sarah. - Bye, Drake. Have fun, girls. Keep it clean. I can't believe we're really going! - Call me when you get there. - We're going to Tel Aviv! - Bye! - Bye, Drake, lousy lay. - I'm sorry, Mr. Pullman. - [LAUGHS] - You have fun. - Thank you, Daddy. - I love you, kid. - I love you. Oh, shit, it's almost 2:00. We gotta go. Come on. We're gonna be late. Bye, Mr. Pullman! - Bye, Daddy! - Thanks for the ride! Sarah, don't forget to send me some pictures! - Let's go! - [LAUGHING] I'm really happy we're finally doing this. I think it will be really good for you. - What's our seat number again? - It's here. 15. - Mm-hm. - Rache, how's he doing? - Rache. - What? Okay, so, Sarah and Rachel. - Yes. - Yeah. So, Kevin, where are you from? I'm from all over. I travel a lot. So where have you been to? Well, I've lost count. You see, I study anthropology, so I really like traveling, exploring different cultures, especially ancient ones. - Sounds fascinating. - Wow. That sounds interesting. I guess that probably sounds boring to you. No, no, no, no, really. It's actually sounds really cool. So what are you, some kind of Indiana Jones? Exactly, only much better looking. [SARAH GIGGLES] [SNORING] KEVIN: That's exactly what I'm saying. Every religion calls it in a different name, but actually everyone's talking about the same thing. SARAH: Cool. KEVIN: In Islam, it's the Dark Angel. For Jews, it's Golem. And in Christianity, it's the undead or zombies or whatever. SARAH: Whoa. [RUMBLING] Oh, God. I hate these fuckers. What was that? RACHEL: Israel, here we come. SARAH: Glass, take a picture. - Here we go. - Glass, what time is it? - Holy shit, it's hot. - Whoa. - We got beach weather. - Totally. - Ouch! - Sorry. Listen, I've got an offer you can't refuse. Offering to carry our bags to Tel Aviv? That's so sweet of you, Kevin. Take mine. It's a very special time in the holy city. - Come with me to Jerusalem. - Jerusalem? - It's gonna be fun. - Yeah, Rache, what do you say? Will you excuse us for a second? Just one second. Sarah, come here a second. What? What is it? Oh, my God, you're such a slut. - What? Why? - Why? Just admit you want a taste of that ass. And that stupid hat. - Just admit it. - Okay, fine. But come on, Rache, we're just changing the order. First Jerusalem, then parties in Tel Aviv, okay? The whole point of the trip is to have fun, right? You just chew it? It's good. Make you strong in the bed. - Take, take. - SARAH: What is that? - I've gotta try this. - Voice command. Call Dad. Kevin, I'm serious. Don't eat that. - No, no! Shit. - [LINE RINGING] It's nice. It's disgusting! - Nasty! - It's bitter. Whatever, fine. Hi, sweetie. Oh, shit. Sorry, Dad. I forgot it was nighttime. No, it's okay. I'm glad you called. Have you landed? Are you in Tel Aviv? Actually our plans are kinda changed. We're heading to Jerusalem now. Is that okay? Should I be worried? - No. - Hi, Mr. Pullman! - Hi. - No, no, don't worry. Everything's fine. Kevin, does that make your mouth burn? - My whole mouth is... - Oh, my God, it's so gross. - It's disgusting. - Close your mouth. This is so disgusting. This is a big big graveyard, very old. - Got a lot of dead people here. - A lot. This is the entrance of the city. A graveyard. Very symbolic, ah? You see, we have a beautiful, beautiful tradition of killing each other. [LAUGHING] KEVIN: This is Damascus Gate. - [BELL TOLLING] - Oh, wow. Kevin, we're going straight to the hostel, right? Yeah, we are. RACHEL: What are those, cigarettes? - Oh, what is that? - Rache, cool it. Look at all that. Wow. Hey, kid. What do you want? No, no. Sorry, you can't have my glasses. Too expensive. RACHEL: Look at these these colors. Look at the little guy leading the way. Where are we going, little guy? Hey, buddy, wait up. KEVIN: I don't know. It was supposed to be here somewhere. Glass, open navigation. Okay, take a right. - [COINS JINGLING IN CAN] - [MAN SPEAKING HEBREW] Keep walking. I love America! - Just ignore him. - Keep walking. I am David. King David. If you need guide, I am your man. The best in the town. - No, thanks, we're good. - We're fine. Oh, my God. Is he for real? - God, the heat is killing me. - I feel old. - I think it's here. - This place? - Yeah, this is it. - Watch your head. Seems like people used to be smaller. Unbelievable. - Wow. - Whoa. - Hey, guys. - Cheers, mate. Let's go up. - Heaven! - Totally. Let's go. Glass, take a picture. - Cute ass. - What? What? Nothing, nothing. - Hey. - Hello. - Salam alaikum. - Hello. Welcome. Welcome, my friends. Sit, please. I'll be right with you. Thank you. Omar! We have a guest. - I'm coming! - Omar! Glass, take a picture. [BELL DINGS] Oh, my God. Told you this place is nice. Yeah, looks amazing. Hello, sir. [SPEAKING ARABIC] I'm sorry. I don't speak... Grandfather says you bring the smell of innocence. Thanks, I think. Oh, my God. I'm so thirsty. You don't mind, do you? Thanks. Jesus, my feet hurt. Oh, God, Rache. No, don't do that. [SPEAKING ARABIC] SARAH: What did he say? She brings the smell of feet after two weeks in the desert. - [LAUGHTER] - Thanks. You two are very, very beautiful, but this I say. - Cold lemonade. I squeeze. - Thanks. Actually it's the very high season now so you'll need to be in the room upstairs. Actually they are much better because of the view. It's 100 shekels each, but you get free Wi-Fi. - [OMAR SPEAKING ARABIC] - SARAH: Bye, Kevin. - See you later. - See you later. - Sure. - Bye. What? And because you two are so beautiful, I upgraded you to the ultra premium turbo deluxe suite. - Wait and see. - Sweet! - Yes! All right. - Voila! What? Are you kidding me? - You like? - This is your premium suite? - Thank you, Omar. - Yeah, thank you, Omar. Your hostel is, well, lovely. - What is this? - A tip. Ah. No way, Jose. But if you insist, I will let you buy Omar a beer tonight. Okay, well, only if you take us to a really, really cool place. But only if you dance with Omar. Sure, but only if Omar promises to get us the best hash in town. Ah, you will wait and see. Omar will give you... party time. - Party time? - What? Enjoy your stay! Thank you! Oh, God. Oh, my God. This is hysterical. - Oh, my God, I'm so tired. - Me too. Maybe just a quick nap and then we're off to hit the town with your new blond boyfriend. Glass, what time is it? Rache? Rache? Rache? Kevin? Where is everybody? [DISTANT MANDOLIN] Kevin? Rache? Excuse me, sir. Sir? [GASPS] Oh, God. Hi. Hi, pretty one. He plays so beautifully. He plays to calm down the demons. The bad spirits. Bad spirits? Wow. We have a lot of superstitions here. Do you believe? Me? No. I'm old school. I believe in science. You are stupid... but beautiful. Excuse me? [SCOFFS] That was weird. WOMAN IN ABAYA: Hey. Pssst! Come. SARAH: Can I help you? WOMAN: Come. - What? - This way. - Your friend is in trouble. - What did you say? - Your friend is in trouble. - My friend? What happened to her? Hey! - Hey, come back here. - Hurry. - Where is she? - This way. What? Wait a minute. Hey. Pssst! - Will you stop for a minute? - Come! - What? - This way. Hurry. Hurry. Come on. This way. What do you want? To do the funky chicken dance. What? What the... - What the fuck? - [LAUGHING] - Oh, my God! - Rache! You should have seen your face! Oh, my God, I'll kill you, you bitch. - You scared the hell out of me. - Come on! - How long can you sleep? - Rachel, slow down a second. You have no idea. This place is crazy. We're right next to the market, and there's a ton of cool shit. Okay. Are you ready? - Oh, wow. - Check it out. - No way. - I know! Look where we are! It's insane. - Oh, my God. - KEVIN: Sarah! Come join us. - Isn't it crazy? - It's amazing. Not bad, ah? You can see everything from here. This is temple northern Al-Aqsa. Next to it is the Armenian quarter. This is the Jewish quarter. And we are in the Muslim quarter. A church next to a synagogue, next to a temple, all stuck together. No wonder you all hate each other. Sarah! Well? What do you say, white boy? This Lebanon hashish not the poopoo stuff you smoke America. - [COUGHS] - [LAUGHS] Man, I smoked some shit in my life, but this is something else. Hey, but take it slowly. I don't want you to go in the flip side, okay, white boy? [ARABIC] Come on! Shake it, Sarah. - Just one more puff. - [LAUGHTER] Come on, shake it. There you go. - There you go. - Shake that ass. KEVIN: Shit, I'm stoned. [SARAH GIGGLES] RACHEL: So where are we going now? OMAR: Well, I think someone owes me a drink. KEVIN: Wait. Aren't you Muslims not allowed to drink alcohol? OMAR: Everybody has his own score with Allah. - But don't tell my father, ah? - Don't worry. Get ready! Omar is taking you party tonight! Jerusalem style! RACHEL: Ooh, Jerusalem style. Hey, guys, wait up. I'm just taking a picture. - See. Omar? - Glass, take picture. Hey! Hey! Hey! Come back here! Come back here! Give me my bag! [PANTING] Shit! Shit! Stop! Stop!

I can't believe that fucker stole my bag. Okay, enough with the sour face. Come on, what's up with you? You left the passport here, so everything's cool, okay? We have a shitload of cash and the credit card I swiped from my dad, so what are you worried about? I just left my prescription glasses in there. Now I'm stuck wearing these things. Okay, lady, you've bitched enough. - Come on, it's selfie time. - Okay. Just a little touch for Mr. Indiana. Rache, what are you doing? Cut it out. Well, come on. It's bad enough you're lugging around those disgusting glasses everywhere we go. Let's at least get Kevin look where we want him to. Perfect! Okay. I'll take a picture of us. Okay. Here we go. Okay. One for us. All right. And now one for Instgram, so Drake Lazy-lay can get a little jealous. Mmm! Now let's hit the city Jerusalem style. Jerusalem style. RACHEL: Hey, guys. Hello! What is that? OMAR: They say there was a murder in the old city. But it's bullshit. [REPORTER SPEAKING ARABIC] What happened? It's nothing. It's, uh... It's nothing, it's a... Baa baaa! What? Lamb, lamb. - A lamb? - Yes! Somebody threw blood on the wall and everybody goes... cuckoo-ruckoo. Okay, but it's still safe to go outside though, isn't it? Yes, of course. Let's go. Nothing. You are tourists. You are walking wallets. Everybody loves you. Let's go. OMAR: Oh! King David. [SPEAKING HEBREW] Listen, you must leave before Yom Kippur. - Why? - No one believe me, but now they will see. They will all see. See what? But this time, I ready for them. What are you talking about? It worked with Goliath, and it will work now. Okay, King David. - I have to go now. - We are going also. They are looking for me. They are looking for us, too, in the club. Thank you. - It's okay. - Just be careful. - What's his story? - It's sad. He's loco-loco, this guy. This is the place. Come. Watch your step. - This is perfect. - Yes! Nice. Oh, wow. We're here in Girls Gone Wild in Jerusalem. - And this place is crazy! - Whoo-oo! Listen, your friend's very cute. Omar like. SARAH: A lot. Are you two really Jewish? Yeah, as Jewish as they come. But I don't think we should leave her by herself too long. Whoo-hoo! Cheers. [CONTINUES] SARAH: Uh-oh. Poor guy. Someone's in trouble. - Hey! Everyone, shots. - Hey, Bartender, hang on. I need two more shots for these guys over here, please. Thanks, but I'll do with my Coke. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My friend is not very polite. We would like very much to have a drink with you. You're allowed to have fun sometimes, aren't you, soldier? SARAH: We need shots all around of your best vodka, please. Hey, do you know these guys? These clowns? They're patroling around our hostel every day. Okay, everybody! Cheers! Salud... Where are we? L'chaim! - Cheers! - Party! Hey, funny glasses! [LAUGHTER] Gimme, gimme! Hello! Whoo! [KISS] I love you. Hi, Sarah! What's up? KEVIN: I've gotta try them on. With these glasses, you look even hotter! - Very funny. - No, no! I'm serious! Did anyone ever tell you how amazingly beautiful you are? - What's going on here? - Nothing. - Sarah... - I don't know. - Where are you taking me? - It's a surprise. Shit, your Facebook's on. - MAN: Need some help? - KEVIN: Fuck off. How does it work? So I just touch the pad here? - Excuse me, sorry. - Sorry, guys. Sorry. Nice pictures. Look at you. Too much clothes. Hey, come here. Don't move. Hey, what's going on? What do you think is going on? I don't know. So who's the guy with the stupid hat? Is he your boyfriend or something? - What did you say? - Looks like a douche. [LAUGHS] What? Sarah, what? - Leave me alone! - Sarah, come back! It's a joke! - Sarah, come on. - Fuck. - I'm going back to the hostel. - We're just getting started. I'll go by myself. - Come on, Sarah. Just hang on. - No. I'm leaving. RACHEL: Sarah! Glass, open navigation. Glass, open navigation. Glass. Come on, Glass. Excuse me, sir, do you know where... Excuse me. Sir, excuse me, do you know where... Oh, great timing, Dad. Not now. [DISTANT DOG BARKING] Shit. Where the fuck am I? Come on. Shit. MAN: Hey! - Wait! - [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS] - [GASPS] - Hey, it's me. Let's get out of here. Come on. Listen, I'm sorry about what I said. It's not your fault. It's okay. Guy in the picture was my brother. He died in an accident a year ago and... [WINGS FLAPPING] What is it? No. Nothing. I thought I heard something. Listen, I'm sorry about your brother. - I didn't mean to... - No, it's cool. I just need to try and move on with my life. That's the reason Rache dragged me on this trip. - Take me back to the hostel. - Yeah, sure. I'm gonna drink a few gallons of water and pass out. You have a nice hangover. Good night, Indiana. Thanks for rescuing me. Pleasure was all mine. Hey, Kevin. Yeah? Let's take that off. [GIGGLES] - Do me, Indiana. - Come here. SARAH: Hey. Kevin? Hey, what's up? What's the matter? Jet lag? Some strange noises I heard woke me up. Voices? What are you talking about? More like distant screams. I'm not making any sense, am I? Will you please tell me what's going on? There's something I want to show you. I'm sending you the link. Kevin, you're freaking me out. I found it on the Darknet, doing my research. Just watch it. Okay. Glass, open link. They say it's from the Vatican's archives. Representatives from all three religions are here. It concerns all of us. [CHANTING] In the name of the Lord, return to the ground! [SHRIEKS] You know this thing is total bullshit, right? Yeah, I guess so. Okay, so let me see if I got this straight. You think that in this city, people are just coming back from the dead all the time, - like coming out of the ground? - No, not all the time. According to what I read, it happened here before. More than once. So how come nobody's talking about it? Maybe all the religious leaders know something, and they keep it a secret. Kevin, come on. Why? Maybe they know something that we don't. Maybe the resurrection is gonna happen again. The undead, the dark angels, the Nephilim. Just like it says in the Bible. - Which Bible? - All of them. Okay, Kevin, it's late and you're freaking me out with your apocalypse theory, so... Yeah. It's probably crazy talk. It's stupid. Never mind. It's okay, it's cool. Just get some sleep, Indiana. Yeah. Good night. [MUNCHING] Glass, close link. - [SPEAKING ARABIC] - Omar! It's "good morning" in Arabic. Sabbach-whatever to you too. Judging by that smile, I see it was a good night as well. Aywa. That's "yes" in Arabic. I figured. There you are, you naughty girl. - Good morning, princess. - Good morning. Where did you disappear to last night? Come on, I want to hear everything. [CLEARS THROAT] Okay, I go. Squeeze lemonade. - [SIGHS] - Well? Well, well, um... Let's just say that lightning struck last night. Several times. What about you, Mrs. Jones? Uh... No way. Oh, my God! Somebody's finally starting to go with the flow! - [LAUGHING] - No! - It's gone, it's nothing. - My dad's gonna kill me. I didn't scratch it. Just try it on. - Rache... - It's gone. - I think it's broken. - Let's go. It's not working right. Today Omar takes you for sightseeing in the old city. We'll start at the market, and then we'll go to the Armenian quarter, and then we'll go to the Jewish quarter and finish with the great... - Opa. - Hey. Hello, good morning, neighbor. Hello. - Glass, take a picture. - You like what you see? OMAR: I hate these assholes. RACHEL: Really? They seem nice. You Americans are so nave. But you know how to party. SARAH: Kevin, what's up? What is this place? OMAR: This? You don't want to come here, believe me. This is, eh... How you say? - A cuckoo house. - SARAH: A cuckoo house? - What, like a mental asylum? - Yes, for people who go crazy. There's a lot here in the city like this. A lot of tourists come here, they see their own eyes what they read in the Bible, and they go cuckoo-ruckoo. KEVIN: You mean Jerusalem Syndrome? Yes. This city can bring a lot of madness for the people. Let's go. - [LOUD CHATTER] - Sarah, look at me. Oh, wow. Pretty. "Don't Worry, Be Jewish." SARAH: I'm so getting that one for my dad. See? What's that? OMAR: This is where we pray. SARAH: No way. That's amazing. They're all praying? They always pray here. KEVIN: Nice dress. Yeah, very. I'm gonna check how much it is. No. Kevin, stop. Don't worry. I got this. You Jews wear white on Yom Kippur, right? Now you have something to wear. Thanks, Indiana. - Rache! - Is this real leather? - [BELL TOLLING] - Wow. Sarah, you're gonna get lost. Come on. Okay, okay. - Smells like something. - You smell perfect. Rache, I don't think you're allowed to do that here. Put it in your bag. Western Wall. This is the holiest place in Israel. - Better give it some respect. - All right, all right. Rache, you know I don't believe in that nonsense. Just give it a chance. Just write down your deepest and strongest wishes, okay? All right. Here it is. Nothing special. Just world peace. Hope we're good. - [SQUAWKING] - Whoa. What the hell? - What the hell? - What the fuck? That was creepy. Let's get out of here. What is this place? Come on, let's go. Come on, come on. GUIDE: Welcome to King Solomon's Quarries, the biggest artificial cave in the Middle East. - OMAR: Take helmet. - GUIDE: Please, everybody, take a helmet and turn on the headlights. You know that these are the exact same flashlights that were used by King Solomon's diggers a thousand years ago. [LAUGHING] - GUIDE: Okay. - SARAH: That wasn't funny. King Solomon was... [MUMBLING] Bla bla bla. Bla bla bla. - Boo! - Rache! Stop doing that! Yeah, I'm a retard, I know. WOMAN: Excuse me, I have a question. SARAH: Hey, Kevin. Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Sure. Let's go. This just keeps going deeper and deeper. This is insane. Kevin? Kev? Indiana? KEVIN: I'm here. Hey. There you are. What is that? GUIDE: You can see the peephole, the eye peek. There are plenty more like this all around here. KEVIN: This guy is really starting to bug me. - Can we get out now? - Yeah, sure. We're almost done. GUIDE: Researchers are still arguing what these holes are for. Some say it's for... SARAH: What's wrong? I'm suffocating in here. I can't breathe. Oh, my God. It's okay. Come on, it's okay. - Hey, are you good, white boy? - Yeah, yeah, you guys go on. - We're fine. - Are you sure? Yeah, yeah. We're just gonna go out for some air, okay? We'll meet you back at the hostel. Come on, Kevin. Everything's okay. I'll take you outside. - It's okay. - KEVIN: Come on, Sarah. - Everything's okay. - No, it's not. I'm going to the city archives to check the books. Kevin. Kevin, wait for me. - Hey, Kevin! - Something's not right. Hey, wait up! Hey, Kevin! Oh, God. That cave was insane, wasn't it? Yeah, it was nice. Too bad you guys weren't there waiting for us. Omar took us to the best hummus place. Kevin needed some air. I'm really worried about him. Listen, Rache, I think we got Jerusalem covered. I mean, I was talking to Kevin, and we're thinking of going to Tel Aviv tomorrow night. What do you think? Why? The vacation's just beginning. Are you serious? Now I want to stay, and you want to go? Rache, there's something weird about this place. Or maybe you two are developing Jerusalem Syndrome, - and you are going crazy. - Fuck you, Rache, I'm serious. Oh, God, Sarah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm kidding, It's my bad joke. I'm sorry. Okay. Look, the whole city's shut down now anyway, okay? So the second Yom Kippur is over, we're outta here. Promise? Hmm? [BANGING ON DOOR] KEVIN: Sarah, Rachel, open up! RACHEL: Sarah, what's going on out there? You have to pack now! We have to leave! SARAH: Why? What happened? I don't understand. Kevin, listen to me. Everything's gonna be fine. We're gonna go to Tel Aviv tomorrow night. There's not gonna be tomorrow night! - What are you talking about? - I know you think I'm crazy. Something bad is happening here, Sarah! Pack up! Kevin! Kevin don't! - RACHEL: What the fuck?! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Kevin! You have to believe me 'cause they won't. SARAH: I don't understand what you're talking about. Omar, Fauzi, everything's okay. I got this. - [SPEAKING ARABIC] - KEVIN: Sarah, tell them to go. Listen, Kevin, everything's gonna be fine, okay? - Just calm down. - [SPEAKING ARABIC] No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. KEVIN: Sarah, listen to me! - We have to leave! - Were there any signs before? It's important for you to remember. SARAH: I don't know. He just started talking funny, and then all of a sudden... I don't know. I don't know. Everything will be okay. Don't worry. KEVIN: Get your hands off me! - Kevin, my friend, come. - No, no, no, no! SARAH: Hey, Fauzi, stop. Hey, guys, where are you taking him? OMAR: Come with us. Don't worry. Everything will be okay. Come, come. Watch the steps. Come. Are you okay, ladies? We have a saying here: "If you're talking to God, it's good. But if God is talking to you, then you have problem." - Where have they taken him? - Don't worry. He will rest a few days, and he will be as good as new. That's what usually happens to people who go [WHISTLES]. It's not the first time it's happened here, is it? No. This happens a lot here, especially to Catholics. Go figure. Anyway, I see you later, ladies? Hmm? Don't worry. He will be just fine. RACHEL: The second Yom Kippur is over, we're on the first bus out of this place. - We're restarting this trip. - What about Kevin? You heard what Omar said. He's gonna be fine. Just give him a couple of days. He's gonna be as good as new. Don't worry. Okay. Okay. Let's go get some rest. It's Judgment Day tonight, and God knows I've got a lot of sins to redeem. Yeah, right.

There is a way. - Crazy. It won't work. - What? [SPEAKING ARABIC] SARAH: What? When he was a kid, he used to smuggle food... He wants to go out through the caves. But it's one big maze down there.

It's nothing. What? Well, what? Talk to me. SARAH: Nothing. Are you feeling okay? Yes! I told you I'm fine! What the fuck's wrong with you? Nothing. It's just a scratch. Use this. So what do we do now? I don't know. I think we have to tell the others. What? Before it's too late. We have to tell them. No fucking way. - Listen. - No, just listen to me. I don't trust these guys, okay? They're soldiers. They're gonna kill her. This thing is contagious. You saw what happened at the asylum. She'll become violent soon. We have to do something or none of us is getting out of those caves alive. That's why we need to get her to a doctor now. - She'll be fine. - It's too dangerous. So what are you gonna do? We're just gonna leave her here? Maybe. I don't know. Just like they left you? You listen to me. You owe me, okay? I saved your ass. So you just shut up and do this for my friend.
