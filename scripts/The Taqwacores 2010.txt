The flier says everyone there's Muslim. Very good bita, you can live with them. Better than the dorms. Yep. They will keep you focused and out of trouble. Insh'Allah. Insh'Allah Yusef? Yeah, Umar? As'salaamu alaikum. Wa-alaikum as-salaam. So, is everyone here Muslim? From a certain point of view. Yeah, I didn't expect the house to look like this. Your room's over here brother. Sorry. This is Mustafa's old room. He was a brother from Egypt. You know, Mustafa used to get these for free from the Saudi embassy all the time. Y'akhi when he was here, that was when we really had it, a house that was true to Islam. Insha'Allah we can return to that. Insha'Allah. Uh..Are you okay? I am, the Amazing Ayyub. Nice to meet you. Do you live here too or are you, uh. Yeah. Sort of, man. Cool. Is that a fucking camera dude? This is like video, right? Yeah I need to recharge the batteries for that. If you could please. Do You know anything about computers? The password, it's, I gotta reset it. I should really get to studying now. Oh! Ah, no no let me get it, naw, I got it. Aw you're smearing it now. You're really smearing it. Yusef man! You're gonna fit in. You're gonna fit in my balls! Welcome to the house. I feel really welcome, thank you. I'm just gonna. Salaam-alaik. Wa alaikum as I was just looking for something to drink. Aw, well, there's plenty to drink. No, I was thinking something halal. Oh, halal? Well you've gotta be specific in this place. Jazakullah khair. (Thank you) You're the new guy, right? Salaam, I'm Yusef. I'm Rabeya. Have a seat. Um actually I have to be going because I have, um I have um class in a bit, so I . Oh right, right every time a man and a woman are alone shaytan is the third present. Yes, No I mean no that's not it I just, uh... Well did you make your fajr prayer yet? Sorry You have to count me out, I'm ragging it. Okay. Umar y'akhi? Umar y'akhi? Umar y'akhi, wake up, it's time for fajr prayer. Salam Yusef. Go make wudhu, I'll follow after you. Okay. Bimillahir rahmanir raheem. La ilaha illa Allah. Fuck. Asalams, man. Wa asalaams. I'm Yusef. Jehangir. Nice to meet you. I'm Fasiq. You're the new guy, right? Yeah. You should have been out here with us last night y'akhi. Oh no, I'm not much of a partier. No worries man. Come on, get out here, come on. Yeah? Come check out the view, come on. Wa salaams man. Calling us out to prayer on your guitar? That's bid'ah. Okay. It's bid'ah. Hey you know, Umar. It's only Muslims who use the term innovation to mean something bad. Don't forget that you're Muslim too Aren't you? La ilaha illa Allah. Umar. Y'akhi. The adhan has been called, if we're gonna pray. Let's pray. These Muslims don't respect freedom, they don't respect capitalism, and they don't respect our way of life! We can't coexist with these people. And, and the liberals, their starting to find that out. Look, it's a proven fact. It's been documented! Radical Shiites are coming to America and going on welfare. Shut the fuck up! Then they send their welfare checks back to Iran to support its nuclear program! Y'akhi. It's not a good idea to be drinking tea. Why not? Caffeine is a stimulant. Know, I wouldn't go as far as calling tea haram, but it's at least makrooh. Tea is makrooh? Brother, it's a plague amongst the Muslim world is what it is. Salam. It's great. All you need to get rid of Umar is a vagina! Bro, how do you fix this thing man? What are you doing? Ayyub come on, please, you're gonna break my camera, that was a present for Eid. Yo, fuck that shit, fix this and let's go fucking skate! Skate? Move! Move! Move! Fucking nut. Douchbag! Yo, when you gonna hook it up with some of these taqwacores tapes bro? Ah man, those fuckers only put their shit out on vinyl, man. Yeah, they like to be all orthodox about it but, uh, for you Amazing Ayyub I think I can put something together. - Yeah? - Yeah, man. - Thanks bro. - Absolutely brother. What do you guys mean by that? What? Taqwacores. Aw shit. Yusef jaan. Come on man, how long you been in the house for, brother? Taqwacore. Taqwacore y'akhi. Vote Hezbollah. The Kominas. One Trip Abroad. AIThawra. Osama's Tunnel Diggers. The West coast Muslim punk scene. Khalifornia. Muslim punk scene? Yeah all the crazy fuck ups and rejects of the community, coming together man. Starting bands, putting on shows. Nobody likes em. The Muslims say they're not really Muslim, the punks say they aren't really punk. What's a punk in the first place? I mean who knows any more, man. Some say it's about busting social taboos. Some say it's about being loud... Everybody's got their own opinion. What do you think it means? I think it's just about being ugly. That's why you can't be punk. You look too good. Watch this shit. Shit, shit, shit, yo check this out, check this out. Y'akhi! Dude, are you okay? - You alright? - That was fucking awesome man! Are you alright? Yeah, holy shit. Fuck, Mash'Allah man, I was in the air so long it was like I had time to stop being nervous, brother. Yusef, you gotta get that shit in a skateboard video man. Fuck that, I'm gonna to land it right now. Bullshit you are. You okay? Turn that shit off for a second. Oh, sure. Listen man. Next Friday, we're holding jumauh prayer and we're gonna do it right at the house. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. Jehangir, who would come? These Muslims y'akhi. The ones who don't quite fit in at the Muslim center picnics. The boys who miss their prayers. The girls who date behind their parents backs. The ones who ask too many questions during Saturday school. I can't believe Umar's allowing this. At the end of the day  he'd rather see this than another party. And you know y'akhi, deep down even Umar knows he doesn't quite fit in at the masjid any more. What do you think they see when he walks in the door? What about an imam? Don't we need somebody to lead this? That's the best part. It is said in the Quran that Allah spoke directly to the virgin Mary. It is said that she was instructed to teach Islam to her people. She was told that something was going to happen and that thing did indeed happen. And do you know what that sounds like to me? It sounds like the virgin Mary was a prophet of Islam. So, why do we not consider her one? She wasn't given a scripture but I say that her book was her son. So that's my khutbah. Let's pray. Takbir! Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. As'salaamu alaikum, Yusef. Wa alaikum as-salaam Abu. How are your classes? Still straight A's? Yes Abu, al'hamdulilah. How are your housemates? They keeping you in the dean? You reading your namaz regularly? Yes, Yes Abu. Al-Hamdulilah. Oh, peace. Hello. Hi, I'm Lynn, I'm a friend of Fasiq's. I'm Yusef. Nice to meet you. Is he here? Is who here? Fasiq. I don't know. I think I don't think so actually. That sucks, I just thought I'd try and say hi. Lynn! - Jehangir! - Salaam, how are you? So what's the good word? I'm just out for a jog. You don't come around much? I know. I've just been super busy with summer classes. But I hear you guys are having Friday prayer now. Yeaheveryone's taking turns leading. It's beautiful, you gotta come out. Oh yeah? Totally, I'm there. Well, um, I better get back to running but I'll see you guys soon. Yeah, insh'Allah - bye. - Salaam sister. Wa alaikum as-salaam. What Look at this. I've got Omar's keys. Beer run? You're frightening me! You're crazy. You give it a shot man. Give what a shot? Come on, yell something. What? Come on. Here, up ahead. That old dude. - What? No. - Come on, don't be afraid. Okay, okay. Uh. Hurry up, hurry! You make me really nervous! What'd the guy do? I don't think he understood what's going on. It's fucking hilarious man. What's up with that girl Lynn? What do you mean? I mean, like, is she a Muslim? She is a convert. Or revert as I'm supposed to say. You know, a Catholic girl who loved Rumi the whole idea of no priesthood. One love. One God. All that shit, you know? But I guess she kind of burnt out man. So she's not a Muslim any more? You'll have to ask her about that brother. Here we go, right here. - Right here? - Yeah yeah, pull over. - Hold on, I have to signal. Alright, you gotta signal. - Right here, right here. Turn the corner. - Hold on, let me signal. Let me signal. My mom would be very proud of me right now. - Why? - Hanging out with a good boy like you. Amazing Ayyub always hooks up the free booze man. Five bucks says he isn't wearing a shirt. Give me some! Give me some! I'm so fucking happy you guys are here! Get on it! Get on it! Get on it! What the fuck are you fucks doing here man? Well we're here to undermine the fucking U.S. Economy so fill her up mate! Fill her up! Alright, I'll be right back. Is it okay he jumped on the Umar's not going to notice. Shut the-dude, why do you worry so much? Worrying is a sin. Aren't you gonna get in trouble for this? Fuck this place man. I get more loot giving hand jobs at Niagra Falls man. Great. Umar's gonna kill me. Dude, you want one? - No. - Here. - No, I don't want it. You're just a straight edge guy, huh? You're just all nice and all. You guys, I gotta give these cumbuckets some gas, I'll be right back. Asalaam. What do you guys want? - A-Salaama-lick my balls mother fucker. - What the fuck did you say. Thank you, come again! Stupid mother fuckers. Fucking Dickwads. Oh shit, you didn't fucking kick my car mother fucker!? Catch me! The desire for freedom resides in every human heart. And that desire cannot be contained forever by prison walls or Marshall laws or secret police. Over time and across the earth, freedo m will find a way. Hey Yusef, is that you? Uh, yeah. Come in here a sec. You want me to come into the room? What the fuck do you think I mean by, come in here a sec? Okay. Hey. I like your room. It's a ceiling and some walls. Who's this? Secret Trial Five. They're an all girl taqwacore band from Vancouver. So Lynn came by the other day. She thinks you're cute. Are you serious? Yeah, I was kinda surprised too. Anyways, do you like her? Oh, I mean, she's nice and stuff. But I don't know about liking girls and stuff like that. What. Okay, I mean, like, finding out if someone likes you, and then if you like them, and ask them if they want to go to the movies ... People don't do that any more Yusef. What do you mean? Basically, you just hang out with someone and then sooner or later you hook up with that person. And then one of the people gets jealous so you decide to only hook up with each other and then. Bam! You're in a relationship. Oh. Why don't you just, like hang out with her and see what's gonna happen. Okay. Cool. What's this? What? This. You, you crossed out a whole ayat in the Qur'an. Yeah, which one is that? Let me see, um. Four, Four-thirty four. Right, I didn't need that one any more. What, you just felt like you could cross out the word of God? I mean, you can't do that. Well that ayat advises men to beat their wives so what do I need that for. No, you can't do that. And most translators say that it means to beat lightly and their's a story of Job where he used a blade of grass. Yeah, Yusef, I know. I read what all the scholars said okay, even the progressives. I did all the tap dancing around that verse that a desperate Muslim could do. And in the end, you know what I said? I said fuck it. And now, I feel a whole lot better about the Quran. I mean it's kinda weird coming from a girl in a burqa. What about my burqa? No, I mean I meant, uh, you know It must be kinda hard to, like, read and stuff. - That's it, that's all I meant- Okay - in the burqa. Here. Came out wrong. Sorry. Here. This is for you. What am I supposed to do with this? Uh, I don't know. Why don't you wear it? Alright well don't expect me to wear this thing around town and like campus and stuff because people are going to think I'm weird. That's fair. Just so you have it. Okay, well, al'hamdulilah. Shut the door all the way. Hey. Why does Rabeya wear that full burqa? What do you mean? I mean, it's not for sunna, we know that much. You ever have a day you didn't want anybody looking at you? You think that's why she wears it? Hey, what the fuck is this?! What?! What now? This. That's my Quran. Yeah? What's it doing in the bathroom? These are the words of Allah Subhananahu Wa Ta'Ala I left it there because it's fucking raining. Weed's haram for a reason. You do know that, right? No, no, no, no. You see the Qur'an only forbids alcohol, it don't say shit about weed. Five-ninety man. Two, two-one-nine. That shit is khamr as anything else. The bathroom is filthy. Well the whole house is filthy. Yeah. You know, yeah, you're right.You know, back when Mustafa lived here it could have never looked like this. No, let me tell you something about Mustafa. Back when Mustafa lived here Rabeya, could never sit in the fucking living room. Hey, fuck off! Fuck! You know Umar just thinks I'm up here getting faded, but I know my shit. Here. In Suratual-Hijr. Ayat 19 and 20. Allah sent suitable things to grow on the Earth. And with him are the treasures of everything in the world. And he only sent them down in a known measure. This tells us that things from nature are a blessing from Allah. And that he only sent us what we could handle. Embrace it. Yo, you pumped up for tonight's party man? Yeah. Dude, I'm gonna get my dick wet, you're gonna get your dick wet. It's gonna be fuckin. - Hey, uh hey, hey, hey. - Sweet bro. I'm gonna stay back, okay? I gotta . No, it's not like that. I'm just gonna stay back. Alright then, I'll just get the forties  and the blunts and the condoms - don't tell her you got herpes. - Leave me alone. Hey. Hi. As'salaamu alaikum. Wa alaikum as-salaam. Fasiq's awesome, isn't he? What a great khutba. Yeah, it was really out there. So is Jehangir having another one of his parties tonight? Yeah, InshAllah So cool. Friday afternoons all these Muslims come out for khutbas and then at night the punks come in for beer and ass. I dont really think theyre Muslims though. Why would you say that? No, I mean like, from a traditional stand point. Personally, Im not big on the whole Islam is one way approach. What do you mean? I believe in Allah, you know? I just, I dont always call it Allah. I pray the way I want to pray. Sometimes itll be in a church and sometimes on a rug. Interesting. Sorry, I dont know - No. - its hard to explain, sometimes. - Its okay. Its fine. So, do you consider yourself a Muslim? I dont know. Why dont you call Allah and ask him yourself. Good one. Oh, my rides here. Ill see you tonight. - Okay. - Salaam. - Oh oh oh, Yusef! - Hi.

You want to answer to Allah for that? Fucking think about it. Fuck! Whatever. Put a fucking shirt on this guy! Okay. Well get a shirt. Well get you a shirt. Dude, its so fucking good to be back man! Khutba. Islam is a fucking surrender. Thats it. Knowing that you dont run the show, staying mindful of it in everything you do. Take your hands off the wheel. See how it feels. Islam isnt about ayats and hadiths, and niches, and lamps. Its about us. All of us. Allahs too big and too open for my Islam to be small and closed Im so Muslim I am so Muslim. I can say fuck Islam. You know Imam Husain said "He has no religion, let him at least be free in his present life." Lets pray. Jehangir. That was a beautiful khutbah today. Amazing, Ive never heard anything like it man.

Jehangir, theyre a bunch of cocks! Muzzamil jaan. If we deny a band their spot because we dont like their attitude or their interpretations.

So Imam, what youre saying is that the Republican Party should be doing more outreach to American Muslims? Yes yes yes, Because Muslims and Christians share the same values. We are bother opposed to some of these crazy social trends that you see today. These crazy social trends like what, gay marriage? Absolutely. Christians and Muslims should stand united against the homosexual agenda invading our country. Wow, Imam, I gotta tell you. Im really touched here. I feel like weve built some bridges tonight. Yusef. Yeah Come out here a second. Okay So, whats up? One of the bands called up Jehangir from a gas station. Like an hour ago. Yeah Theyll be coming any minute now. I cant wait. Is that all?

Coldest fucking Muslims on the planet. Well then you better get me inside and warm me up. - Want me to warm you up? Tonight we party. Tomorrows the show. bring it! Look at these guys! Pretty punk rock, huh? The star of David? Yeah man, its like Its like Sid Vicious wearing the swastika. You know, punks all about pissing people up and the Taqwacore is punk rock for Muslims, so this is punk up the fucking ass, man! But whats the point? I mean, youre just offending people. Youre just getting everyone riled up. What do you mean? - I mean... - Huh? As-salaamu alaikum! Wa alaikum as-salaam. Kahif alaikum y'akhi! Good, good. How you doing? Good. Man, Im the fucking proof of everything this fucking shit says, the whole shit. The Quran tells you not to drink, right? - Yeah, yeah. Dont fucking drink. I went ahead and I fucked that all up.

Theyre hate mongers. If they had the chance they would have thrown me from a minaret. Yeah Muzzamil. They hate you. They hate me too. They hate all of us for something. Look at us. Were the ones that have always been excluded, afraid to be ourselves. And now what? We get our own scene and start pushing people to the sidelines? Does that make sense? Fuck that. Fuck being as small as they are. Be big. Be bigger than them. Hey yo, brother. Whats up man? Hey, watch it! Man, hey. Whats going on? Im going to be with our guests. Did I ever tell you about the band I had out West? No. You had a band? Yeah. We called ourselves "Hi, my name is Allah" Its the most blasphemous thing we could think of. Though our intentions were pure, we came off as pretty fucking disrespectful, man. What happened to the band? I couldnt do it anymore, man. Whenever I sang I used to get these Awful fucking stomach aches, man. Like a mess of fucking scissors jumbled up inside me. My own body was disagreeing with me. Are you okay? Fuck, Yusef. Theres all these ayats and hadiths against about making divisions in your religion. And theres gonna be seventy-two sects of Islam at the end of the world, right? But only one can be right. What if were another one of those wrong sects? No, this is not a sect. Yeah, thats why I invited Bilals Boulder. Yeah, theyre cocks yakhi, theyre fucking cocks. We all know their cocks.
