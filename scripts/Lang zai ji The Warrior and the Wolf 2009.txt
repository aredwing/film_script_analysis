Freeze! Freeze! After him! Go on! Kill him. Go on! Or he'll kill you. There's only one option in the battlefield, killed or be killed. Hold still! You're brave, not afraid of dying. Thanks... I want to give it all away. You're both shrewd and cunning, it's rare. Where did the wolf came from? Found it. Just let it loose. I let it loose but it came back. Followed me then. But I don't know about warfare. What warfare? It's going to snow soon. After it snow, we can go back. I don't have a home to return to. I only know how to tend sheep and this is a good place. C'mon...killed me! I'm not gonna kill you. You think you can still be freed? I'll be honest with you, not one person managed to leave here before. Ever drank urine before? A decade ago when I was lost, I drank before. Just like a beast. A beast will only harm someone for self presevation. Kill you? I am not a beast. Stop! Release the hostage. You exchanged me, you beast. Give me my sword. We can't release the Prince. Foolish! How many killed? You'll not be afraid of blood after spilling too much of it. You still wanna kill? We lost so pathetically. It deserved dead. It snow at this time every year. Heavy snow fall. Stop fighting... Going home. More than a decade... More than a decade... We lost so pathetically. Take my head back as atonement. Returning meant death to our troops too. Kill me...you beast. Go on! Go on!!! Do it! Do it...you beast. C'mon. It's either you or me that'll be killed. I will not died. I have swords, spears and troops. When the sun arises, there'll be no one to collect your bodies. C'mon...you beast! Come out. Who are you? Dead person. Why are you in hiding? I'm not hiding. This is my home. I have no dealing with a dead person. Go back to your own place. What are you trying to do? I don't want to stay together with a man. I'm releasing you. Crawled back to your own place. You're the one who need to crawl back. Get out! Go back to your own place. Get up! Get up! Faster! Put it down and don't move. It's already cold. Just put it down. Hey-- The Harran tribe just got into a fight. Someone was hurt. The soup is not ready yet. It's okay. A wolf came into the village last night. There's evil in the village. Go on! Kata! Kata! Kata! It's Kata! Let me go! Let go! I will kill you if you continued screaming. Kill me...you beast. I will kill you if you dare to go out. Smile! Show me a smile. Death or alive, it will not come to a good ending. Taking care of a dead person, why not a beast. Eat it! I too am a dead person. Losing the war, I will be sentence to death when I return home. A dead person fear nothing. Don't give me anymore trouble. I don't want to kill anymore. You fear someone will see you. It's humiliating. If someone sees it, I will kill him. Me too...it's humiliating. Let me tell you, if a Harran were to have sex with an outsider, then the alternative would be death. You're not a dead person. Would the dead felt humiliated? Do you think you're better off? My deeds are unforgiveable. Kill me or leave me alone. Come out! Come on out! Kata! Kata! Kata! I beg you to save me, sister. He had been cursed. The tribe's are gonna burn him to death. Let him go. Wait! The snowing stopped?! It's stopping soon. Relay my order, we moved out tomorrow morning. Order relayed...we moved out tomorrow morning. Come out! Come out-- What do you think you're doing? Let me be! Let go! Can't I just die? Go home! Follow me home. I don't have a home. Bite it. We will come to an agreement tonight. You'll be leaving tomorrow. You don't need to remind me. I have already given the order this morning. The snowing stopped. There're no more obstacles preventing the troops movement. Snow-- if I want you to remain, but I can't! I can't bear seeing you becoming a beast. Beast?! Harran tribe folks are cursed! If we were to have sex with outsider, we'll turn into a beast. Kata in fact is my aunty daughter. She came back to see her mother. That's unbelievable. Why should I lie to you? What curse is that? What kind of beast will we be transformed into? Wolf! Only wolf behaved as such. No matter who bumped into them when they're having sex, it'll tracked them down due to humiliation... and bite the other's to death. You mean we will turn into wolves? That's not a bad thing actually. Besides wolf what else could it be? We are already heartless. You are back! I have been longing for you. You have finally return. For the longing of a husband, I've been a dead person. Since it's fated-- I lived only just for you. Transforming into a beast and I'll still just survive only for you. Since when have we became such? We'll only know when we awoke at night. I was afraid at that time. You're here. My heart felt comforted. Lord Zhang.. They're just bandits. They don't know our identities Just let them go. Tell our troops to be careful. Maintain no contact with other people along the way. I just want to debrief in peace. Let's go! Yes! Hey...don't just simply shoot. What do you mean, can't shoot? Just let it be. Get up quick, faster! What's up? You found it? No! - Go and search for it! - Yes! Sold it!? Thrown the cursed object away. Get on the horses and leaves the wolves behind. Yes! You take some troops and lead the wolves away. You must delivered the edict no matter what. Take care! Take a break and feed the horses. We must hurry on our way. Yes!
