Laying six geese are... swimming... That's not right, is it? Not even close. Swans swim, geese lay. Yeah, well, if I ever date a guy who gets me any of those things for Christmas, it's over anyway. Where would you put them in your New York City apartment? "Our" New York City apartment. Mm. "Your" New York city apartment. Beth, stop. You're not just someone who sleeps on my couch, you are my roommate-- end of story. Now, grab some garland and help me Make this tree beautiful for our apartment. I know it's two weeks until Christmas, but I am ready for some Christmas cheer. Yeah. This is just what I need right now. Oh! How was closing night of your play? Shouldn't you be at some cast party or something? No, I could not go to another closing night party of a terrible play that nobody saw. My agent couldn't even be bothered to go to this one, okay. I would much rather be here with you trimming our tree, drinking eggnog. Please tell me that we have eggnog. What am I? An amateur? We'll finish the tree, and then I'll take you for closing night drinks at Fred's piano bar. [Sighs] No. Fred's is for the Broadway crowd. You are welcome there, I feel like an outsider. Every time I go, I feel like I'm riding the coattails of your career. Okay, you are one great audition away from my career being your career. I was you three years ago, plucked from obscurity by my dad's producer friend-- but that is besides the point, and now I'm on my second Broadway play. That'll be you. Especially if you get that David Mamet play. My audition did go really well. You're going to get it. Ohh... I'm going to get it. I have to get it. Because sleeping on the couch, doing bad theater, waiting tables, this is not how it's supposed to be. Life is never "how it's supposed to be." You've got to learn how to roll with it, Bethy, because maybe it'll be even better. [] Good morning, sunshine. I'm just making some French toast before I go to the Hamptons, and... Merry early Christmas. What is this? Open it! This is the first year in forever that you haven't had rehearsal over the holidays, and they cut your hours at the diner, so now you get to go home for Christmas... On me. Nicole... This is too much. I got you earrings. They're not expensive ones. Wow! Thank you for ruining the surprise. [Laughs] Now, I already checked you in, and I arranged to have a limo pick you up when you land. Why are you doing this? Because you're my best friend. And nobody should be alone at Christmas. I mean, it's just not right. You can't sit around waiting to hear about the Mamet play. You deserve a hometown holiday... So go to Kern. They all expected so much for me, you know? "Destined for greatness..." So the yearbook said. Stupid, lying yearbook. [] Yeah. Yeah... New York is great. I'm up for a play, actually. Mamet. Yeah, yeah. David Mamet. It is! It's... very exciting. [] Thank you. [Gasping] Merry Christmas, mama. Oh, my goodness. Oh... oh! Oh, you're home! It's a Christmas miracle. Oh, come on, come on, come on. Get inside. You outdid yourself on the lawn. I can't help myself. Well, it's very festive. Thank you. So... You want to tell me what's going on? Why does something have to be going on? It's Christmas, I wanted to see you. Beth, first you tell me you can't afford a ticket and then you show up out of the blue without so much as a phone call. Surprise? It was my Christmas present from Nicole. -Hmm! -Yeah. My show closed, and I just wanted to have a real hometown family Christmas. Like we used to have, you know? Do I ever! All those Christmases I spent with you in New York, they were fine-- we were together. But this? [Gasps] Oh, we have so much to do. We have to get a tree and... [gasps] Santa. We have to go see Santa! You have some sort of Christmas wish, right? I have, like, a thousand. I hope Santa has time. That was my favorite part of Christmas. I used to get everything I wanted. Then let's get moving! Can I unpack first? Finish my coffee? Relax? Of course. Because, if you're unpacking, it means you're staying put for a while. I kept your room exactly as you left it. [Beth]: You took out all my pageant trophies? How many was I in? Some of those are mine! I won the entire state. You only won the county. Mine should be displayed, too. It's like stepping through a time machine. For both of us, evidently. [Soft chuckling] I saw him today. [Mom]: Barry McCormick? He walked into the pharmacy. I ducked. I think everything is going to be fine between the two of you, Bethy. It's been years! I can't imagine he has any hard feelings toward you. He shouldn't. He stayed. And you chose to leave, so... This is what was meant to be. Have to accept the choices we make in life. I guess so. Okay! Let's go. It is time for some retail therapy. We are going to go see Santa... We're going to make ourselves some Christmas wishes. We are going all out this year! It is going to be our best Christmas yet. Not until I change first. Okay. [Mom]: The gingerbread houses are ready, and Mae is at the shop today, so you can go in and pick those up! The bakery is just swimming in gingerbread. I have so many orders. Merry Christmas. My elf will give you a candy cane, so off you go! Come on over, ladies! Oh, everybody's welcome. Age is just a number, and I-- I am in the wish-granting business. It has been far too long since you had a real Christmas. You go first. No, no. I'm still thinking. Go ahead. Okay, because my list is long, and I intend to get everything. [Chuckling] Santa. So, what do you want for Christmas, young-- and I do mean "young"-- lady? Stop. Now, I wrote everything down, lest you forget anything. And my first wish came true, because my girl came home. Next, I need a new mixer... Beth? Barry. Wow! It is you. -Hi. -Hey. -Hey. [Man]: Is that Beth Baker? Can I set this thing down? Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. Set it down. [Out of breath] This guy... Picks the heaviest tree on the lot. Some things never change. Hi, Dean. Beth Baker is in town. That she is. It's been a long time. [Toddler babbles] There's daddy with the tree! Daddy with the what? Barry, honey... We have been looking for you everywhere. We have to pay for that tree, you know. Look at what that is. There it is! [Laughs awkwardly] Beth? Wow! Hi! Uh, Taylor... This is mommy and daddy's old friend, Beth. Can you say hi? Say hi! Barry and Eileen are married! I didn't-- Barry and Eileen are married! Going on five years. Wow! Wow. She's beautiful. Thank you! We think so. But then again, you know, we're a little biased here. Beth and mommy did drama together! All of the plays. The plays! Yeah, the plays! Exactly. And then she left and I guess we lost touch. It's good to see you. How are you? Crazed, as usual. We promised Taylor that we'd get the Christmas tree up today, so she's very excited. But, luckily, Dean has been very helpful. Listen, we're going to go to the pub later. Why don't you join us? My mother's going to come to look after Taylor, and I want to hear all about your fascinating life in New York. You know, I'm supposed to help my mom put up the lights. Oh! Dean can help you with that tomorrow. Yeah, they're always volunteering me for things. Must be what it's like to be born a weakling, you know, like Barry. Hey! This "weakling" beat you for all-state in wrestling, even though you're bigger than me. And he still won "most athletic." He's never going to let me live that down. Never! Please come. I need you there. I can't listen to this guy's stories anymore. That's enough out of you. I'm going to go pay for the tree. And you can lug it to the car. -Bye. -Bye. We'll see you later. So will your family be there? Will I be the only unmarried spinster of the group? No. It's just me. No wife. No kids. You didn't marry Melinda Casswell? You guys were voted "most likely to get married." Twice. Yeah, no, I did marry Melinda Casswell. She just traded me in for a newer model a couple years later. I never liked her. Yeah, nobody did. You should've told me that. Would've saved me a lot of trouble. [Both laughing] Okay, I'll come. It was a beautiful wedding. You went? I made Eileen's cake. But you never told me that! Honey... I know how hard it was after he decided not to go to New York with you. It's not my style to throw salt on wounds. You didn't ask. I didn't tell. I asked about Barry. Did you? Maybe I didn't. It was just easier to make a clean break. It's all old news anyway, so leave the past where it belongs and enjoy your friends tonight. This one is perfect! Excuse me! We'd like this tree, please. Sorry. Mom, I don't even know what I would say to them. Tell them the truth. I don't even want to tell myself the truth. Honestly, I feel like I should give up, move back home, and... Sell insurance. Oh, stop! We both know you're not going to be doing that. You're going to get that Mamet play, everything is going to be perfect. Broadway will be lucky to have you. Now, I'm going to pay for this tree, and I will meet you afterwards. Dream big, sweetie. [To tree lot worker] I'll follow you. Okay. Ahh! Are you ready for your Christmas wish now? [Chuckles] My mother didn't monopolize your entire afternoon with her laundry list of wishes? [Chuckles mirthfully] I'm Santa Claus. There's no cap on the number of wishes I can Grant. So, what's on your mind? There's this part in a play. Ah. And you want it? More than anything. It would mean that I'm not spinning my wheels in New York. Accomplishments don't mean greatness. They don't hurt. And if you don't get this part? How can you say that? You're Santa Claus! You're in the business of wish-granting. I am. So... you want this part. That's your wish? That's my wish. Consider it granted. Although I have learned that, sometimes, what we don't wish for is more powerful than what we do. All righty. Did you make your Christmas wish? Yeah. Let's go. Bye, Santa. [] [Chatter and laughter] Here you go, Beth! It's on the house. Oh! Wow. Uh, thank you, um...? Georgia. When I was eight, I saw you in Our Town. I cried and cried after your performance. We still talk about it to this day. Drama used to be everything, you know? Now they may have to shut it down. They can't afford a full-time teacher anymore. Yeah, I heard. My mom was telling me that. That's a shame. I loved my drama days. We all did. Those were such good times! Yeah. Please enjoy, guys. Thank you. Thanks. So, Beth, tell us all about your exciting life in New York. Oh, well, you know... it's-- it's New York, it's incredible. You know, I've never been. We should really go. Taylor would love it. She's learning about the "statute" of Liberty, as she calls it, in preschool. We should all go. I bet Beth has some fancy New York City apartment we could all crash in. Right? Yeah. Yeah. You know, I mean... When the weather's nice. Right now it's a mess. How I would have loved to have made a career out of acting, but I did not have the guts... Or the talent. Not like you, Beth. I'd probably be one of those perpetually out-of-work actors, living on someone's couch, waiting tables, praying for that big break that never comes. [Chuckles] Nope. I'm much more suited to the boring old stability of Kern. Well, it's not for everyone. [] Hey, do you guys remember that high-speed chase that happened on main street? It was all anyone ever talked about for weeks! Your dad made us go downstairs and turn out the lights in the pharmacy. We missed it by, like, 30 seconds. We were so mad! The Weekly Kernel must've done a hundred stories on that one event. High-speed chase. That is what you need for the paper to really take off. Yes. I can't believe you took over The Weekly Kernel . I mean, that is huge. Started as an intern, worked my way up. Of course, no one else wanted the job, so that definitely helped my meteoric rise up the ladder. Your daughter is adorable, by the way. Thank you. She keeps us on our toes, that's for sure. Barry's running the pharmacy now. Oh! Yeah, my dad, he retired three years ago. Business is good. Ahh. Your dad always wanted to hand over the reins to you. I'm sure he's glad that you took them. [Guys laughing] Oh! All right, on that note, I think I'm going to go call my mom and check on Taylor. Hey, send her a kiss from me. -I'm gonna get another pitcher. -Sure. [Awkward chuckles] So... So... You married Eileen Taylor. Yeah, I thought you would've heard by now. I didn't get the memo. I didn't have your address. You seem really happy. I am really happy. Great job, great family, great life. I couldn't ask for more. I'm glad. Me too. Everything's-- everything's great. Ah. So you made the right decision, when you decided to leave. You decided to stay. I was always going to leave. We had a plan. We were packed. We had tickets. Well, I guess things work out the way they're supposed to. And we both made choices that led us here. Yeah. To a great life. Exactly. I was hoping this wouldn't be weird between us, after all this time. I'm really glad that they're not. Yeah. So we're good? We're good. Good. Good! [Chuckles] Good. Ah. Yes. There he is. Glass? Oh! Over this way. [] [Beth]: And now you're the fire chief. Yeah, I'd set these little fires in the backyard, I'd grab the hose, and I'd put them out. I remember that! You set Barry's treehouse on fire. Well, everyone has a dream, right? And look at us. We are living ours. You're in New York... And I... Am rescuing cats from trees. [Laughs] So, what's it like being in a real Broadway show? Uh... it's more like off-Broadway. Well, how far off Broadway? Mm. Hoboken, New Jersey. [Laughing] Come on... Beth. I know we haven't seen each other in a while, but we used to be pretty tight. What's really going on? [Sighing heavily] I just... I got to New York and I thought that I would have a career by Friday. It's not like that. It's a building process. It's a lot of pounding the pavement. Nothing worthwhile is ever that easy. If it were, any old dope could do it. I mean, I could do it. Except I really don't think I could do it. [Laughs] But you... [Balls clacking] Well, you were always extraordinary. We had no doubt that you would make it. The thing is, in New York City, every single girl at every single open casting call is the "extraordinary" girl from her hometown. We're, like, a dime a dozen there. Nothing but extraordinary women? Yeah, I've got to go to New York. So, it didn't work out with Melinda. I imagine there's no shortage of dating options here. I date... Here and there. But I just haven't really found anyone that I've clicked with. Maybe I'm too picky. What about you? Is there a man in New York that is eagerly awaiting your return? Mm, I've had a boyfriends over the years, but same thing, nothing... Nothing clicked. Nothing felt... Like Barry? No. Nothing felt right. I just threw myself in my career. There's this part. It could really change everything. [Thumps pool table] To getting it right. To getting it right. Could we give you a ride? Oh, no, it's such a nice night, I think I'm going to walk. Well, let's do this again before you go back to New York. Yes. Definitely. You guys drive safe. -Will do. Good night. -Good night. [Cell phone chiming] Bill. Please tell me you have good news for me. Uh... [sighing] I don't. I'm really sorry, Beth, but you did not get the Mamet show. I mean, it came down to you and just one other girl, but... they-- they went with her. [Bill clears his throat] Listen, Sweetheart, you're a terrific actress-- very talented, and you know I wish you only the best, but... I'm afraid we're not going to be able to do this anymore. I-- I got to let you go. Beth, I just-- I really don't think I'm the right agent for you anymore. You know? But hey, we-- we tried. Right? Uh, ah... I know the timing is bad. Again, I'm really, really sorry. Bill, please, I need an agent. Don't do this to me. It's already done, Beth. But good luck to you, okay, sweetheart? Really. 'Kay? [] He can't be the only agent in New York. Ah, he's not, but he's a really good one, and they're hard to come by, and in this business, nobody wants you until everybody wants you, but at that point, who needs 'em? Yeah... it's the same in the fire business. Yeah, I can only imagine how competitive it must be. [Chuckles] Listen, Beth, I need to ask you-- how come you cut things off with all of us? No phone calls, no visits. We were all so close. I didn't mean to, Dean. You know? I just got swept up in my new life. I had every intention of coming back, once I had something to share. The last day with Barry was hard. All right, look. Neither of you were willing to give up your lives to live someone else's. That's no one's fault. Can you hold on a sec? There's something I have to do. Sure. I'll wait right here. Okay. [] How'd you know I wasn't going to get that part? Oh, you didn't get it? You told me I wasn't going to get it. No, I said "if you don't," but that was a potential outcome. I'm sorry to hear that it happened that way. Well... [sighing] I didn't get it, and I'm probably never going to get the part, and I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Nothing's working out as it should. I had two options. One was to stay in Kern with Barry, and the other was to go to New York City, and both of those are completely a bust. So you think leaving was the wrong choice? I would say so. Here. What is this? It's a key... Maybe to the answers you're looking for. I want you to have it. Why? Because that was your wish-- answers. Now, what would you like to know? What my life would be like if I never left for New York? [Chuckling] Well, then, okay. Ask yourself... And maybe you'll have the answer. -Good night. -Good night. [] So, what was that all about? Just one more little Christmas wish to make. Well, Santa's always good for granting a wish or two. Hope so. Come on, I'll walk you home. [] [Beth sighs] What is that smell? Oh, my mom is super-busy at the bakery this time of year, so her assistant's there. She's here using the oven. 50 orders of gingerbread. Gingerbread is very popular this time of year. 50 cookies? Uh, no, 50 orders, a dozen each. Want one? I don't want to eat all your profits, but yeah, I do, badly. Mom, I'm back! Dean Hubert! Did you come here to help us bake? I... don't know. Did I? Beth lured me in with the promise of gingerbread. Oh, then I taught her right. Okay, you two. Into the kitchen, put on an apron. I am exhausted. I'm going upstairs to have a hot bubble bath and recharge. Huh. What's this? Oh, it's a welcome home gift from a friend. Cute. Chop-chop. No snacking. [] -[Dean chuckles] -Sorry. [] [Beth, laughing] Okay. You know what? This one's never going to pass quality control. Let me see. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. That's bad. You know, you should just give me all the terrible ones and I'll dispose of them properly. Stop. Right, so how many have we done? 86? No. 56? Mm-mm. I could've sworn we were in the triple digits. Uh, not even close. Well, actually-- no, that's not true. [Laughing] Sorry. I hope she's enjoying her relaxing bubble bath while we're down here slaving away. [Loudly] I hope you're enjoying your bubble bath! [Mom]: Why, yes, I am! [Dean laughs] You Baker ladies sure are something. [Laughing] It's nice to see you smiling, Beth. Yeah, tonight's been a lot of fun. I mean, don't get me wrong, I am still bummed about the Mamet play, but I am just so tired of fighting against my life. What are you fighting against? What is, and what I think should be. Those two things are in disagreement. But... I'm letting it go. I love Christmas, it's my favorite time of year, and I'm here, I'm home... I feel like myself again. Then maybe you should stay. I'm not saying that you should give up on your dreams, Beth. I'm just saying that, you know, life shouldn't be a struggle, and maybe it wouldn't be, if you were you, all of the time. [] Mom! Wake up! Mommy, since daddy left early, I made my own breakfast. You made your own breakfast? Do I even want to know what the kitchen looks like? That's okay. Only spilled twice! You only spilled twice? Twice! Mommy! Kevin spilled. Oh, Kevin spilled? Well, I think you should come here, and you should help me clean it up. But it wasn't me. It was Kevey. It was Kevey? Well, I think you should be a good big brother and you should be a helper, and you should be a helper... And you should be a helper! And you should help me... Tickle you! Tickle monster! Tickle monster! [Boys giggling] [] I have twins? [Sighs] I'm sorry, excuse me. Just-- just-- it'll be one minute. I'm so sorry. Oh, I'm sorry, kids-- important north pole business to discuss. [Kids groan] Now, who wants candy canes while you wait? -Me! Me! -I do! What is that key you gave me? Did you get some answers? I don't know. I don't know! I had this dream, and it was so vivid. I'm a mom. Or I will be. Or I would've been had I'd stayed. I don't know, but it was so sweet. Is that what would've happened if I'd stayed in Kern? I'd be married to Barry with two adorable sons? I don't have the answers, Beth. You kind of act like you do, Santa. What did I tell you? I have all the answers? Well, all I'm getting is a lot of questions. [Chuckling mirthfully] [] Hi. -Hey! -[Laughs] You're thirsty. Too much gingerbread last night? Yeah. No, I'm getting some coffee and donuts for the boys-- keeps morale up. We haven't been out on a call in a couple of days. -Want some help? -Please. That's one of the drawbacks of living in a ridiculously safe town. Do you remember when Barry and you stole the Wixleyville mascot? [Laughs] The sheriff told us that we were going to jail for stealing a raccoon. I mean, I'm laughing now, but I was bawling my eyes out then. I seriously thought that I was going to have to visit my 15-year-old boyfriend in prison. Wixleyville... You know, that's where Melinda lives these days, actually. Do you miss her? Uh... I miss who I thought she was, but not who she became. She said that she wanted this life, with me, here, but... Time changes people. You know? I do know. That was fun last night. Like old times. Gang back together. Ah, the gang has taken on a very different form these days. That's not a bad thing, Beth. Change is good. People evolve. You can either fight it, or you can go with it. I think that's the biggest thing that I've learned from my divorce. Yeah, you know, that's actually been my motto this week. "Go with it." You were right, you know, what you were saying last night. So you're thinking of staying? I didn't say that. I'm just trying not to think so much. Good. Because... There's been something I've been wanting to ask you, and I'm not sure how you're going to feel about it, but if you're not thinking, then you're not going to say no. I have been put in charge of the children's performance at the holiday festival, since they can't seem to find a part-time drama teacher. I know! Me, of all people. I'm a disaster. You want to help me out? And by "help me out," I mean... Completely take over, and I'll just shut up and do whatever you say. Well, I'm sure you're not a complete disaster. I would love to help. Ha! I figure, you and me together, we'd do all right. I mean, last night, we accomplished the task of making 468 gingerbread cookies. We're unstoppable! Right. Count me in. So there's a festival meeting tonight at 7:00, Barry and Eileen's house. -7:00. -It's a date. Well, not a date-date. You know, it's a meeting date. Just today... a meeting. Tonight. I will see you there. -Hey, Beth? -Yeah? Don't be so hard on yourself. You're not a dime a dozen. [] [] [Man]: Shirley? Principal Hyde. Good evening. Boy, Beth, we could sure use someone like you around here. Do you know how hard it is to find someone who knows the drama game and is willing to work part-time? I imagine you have quite the search on your hands. If Beth ever decides to stay in Kern... Look at that, Beth, a job offer. Oh, Harold, that's so sweet of you. You should consider that, Beth. Just a few more minutes and then we'll get started. Oh, Eileen, let me help you in the kitchen. Excuse me. [Chuckles softly] Hey, sweetheart! Hi! Oh, are you going to bed? There she is. [Taylor]: Wanna say night-night. [Eileen]: You wanna say night-night to daddy? Night-night, daddy! I'll go tuck her in. Mm-mwah. Night, sweetie! Well, I guess you don't need any help in the kitchen. [] So all of the decorations are going to be delivered on Wednesday, which means we are all going to have to hit the ground running. We only have one week left until Christmas and the clock is seriously ticking. Now, as for the actual theme in the town hall, I have some plans right here that I'm going to pass out. Here you go. This isn't even our domain. This is all about decorating, and I am starving. You want to sneak out of here and get a "corner diner" burger? [Gasps] More than anything. Yes! Okay, let's go. [Indistinct chatter and laughter] [] When things went really bad with Melinda, and all the other guys were asleep, I would come down here and... Just always found clarity here. Figured everything out right here on this bench. Mm. Is that why you never left Kern? Never had to leave. My life is here. My job. My family. This is where I'm happy. So, what about you? I mean, why did you leave? The real reason. I wanted to be great. And you can't be great here? I had already set Kern on fire, so to speak. Mm-hmm. I wanted to set the rest of the world on fire. The problem is, you have to be invited to act, and the invitations just aren't coming. And that's the only way you can be great? Everyone seems so content, and I'm-- well, you have to love what you're doing. That's why we're content. So many people walk through their lives without ever knowing what they're passionate about. You can't give up on your dream, Beth. I just have to figure out how much more fight I have in me. You always have more fight. You just have to figure out if the payoff is worth the effort. I missed corner diner. I think my thighs wouldn't have handled it if I'd stayed. [Both chuckle] What if you'd stayed? You know, what if you never went to New York? Do you think you'd be sitting here on the bench with me, having fries? Probably not. You'd probably be married to Barry. Hmm. Maybe. Mm. [Chuckles] You know, I've got to be honest. I never really thought you guys were right for each other. Really? Yeah. That probably had to do with some unrequited schoolboy crush, but... On me? But you were always with Melinda. No. Before Melinda. [Laughs] But that was a long, long time ago. Yeah. I'm a very different person now. No, you're not. You're still kind to others. And you give your time to people. You're not even mad at Barry for changing his mind at the last minute. You think that you need to find some big, fancy career to have greatness, but... Greatness comes in all shapes and sizes. [Sighs] I just... I wish you could see yourself the way I see you. [Chokes up] I do too. And now I have upset you. [Sighs] That was not my intention. I'm sorry. Why don't I take you home? [] [Kids]: in a one-horse open sleigh hey! So good, you guys! You're going to be great for the festival. Okay, time to pack up your stuff, go to your homerooms. [Bustling] Bye. Beth, it's time for career day in Mrs. Beesley's class. Your husband is on his way. I thought you'd want to know, so you could see him with the kids. Thank you, principal Hyde. I'll head over there right now. [] [Grunts] [Sighs] I always wake up at the worst time. [Sighs] [Dean]: Sorry I'm late. Hi. Thank you for doing this. [Quietly] Are we okay? I was going to call you this morning. I really didn't mean to upset you last night. No! No, we're fine. Yeah? Yeah, I know you were just trying to lift me up. I appreciate it... More than you know. 'Cause I don't ever want to see you sad. Well, let's, uh, get some Christmas going in here. [Dean, chuckling] Okay. Okay, everyone! As you can see, I rounded us up a little help. Miss Beth Baker of New York City is going to be the new director, and I will be co-director. Does that make this any-- a bit more appealing to any of you? -[Unenthused Mumbling] -No? Well, I have a chocolate Santa for each of you... After we finish the song, okay? So let's start with some scales. [Plays the scales] [Kids]: la-la-la, la-la That's good! It's a start. [Plays next scale] [Kids]: la-la-la, la-la Very nice! We can't bribe them every day with delicious treats and candies. We just haven't earned their trust yet. We will. They're going to love it, and soon. How do you know? Because I was them, once upon a time. We have to infuse them with Christmas spirit and the love of theatre. How do you suppose that we do that? We put on a show. Mm-hmm. [] And then, the elves... Bring all the gifts to fill Santa's sleigh-- which will go right here, as soon as it's done being built. Hold it! This one's a-- this one's a train! [Kids cheering]: Yeah! And this one's a doll! [All giggling] And as snow fell on Christmas Eve, the big guy himself, Santa Claus, comes to bring presents to all the children of the world. [Dean]: I forgot my line. What does Santa say? [Kids]: "Ho, ho, ho!" That's right! Ho! Ho! Ho! This is your part, Noah. Mrs. Claus, is my sleigh ready for flight? It is, dear! And the children of the world are waiting. Then I shall go! And deliver presents to all the wonderful little boys and little girls throughout this beautiful land! And remember, children... [Kids]: Don't be naughty! Exactly! Ho, ho, ho! [All cheering] [All laughing] It was all you. No, you're the one that won them over. Yeah, but it was your idea. Let's be honest, you guys... It was all me. I killed as that elf. [Laughs] You know, after all these years, it felt so good to be back onstage. I can't wait for Taylor to be old enough to be in the pageant. Just a few more years. It's too bad you're not going to be here when it's her turn. Well, this year is going to be a success. I knew we'd be a good team. Oh, did you, now? Yeah, we got a full 15 minutes of actual rehearsal today. That's more than I've had the entire week before you came on board. We make a great team! Um, I'm going to call home and check on Taylor. I'll come with you. Okay. So, question for you. What are you doing tomorrow night? Hanging Christmas lights in the foyer with my mom. That is so funny, because I was going to ask you if you wanted to hang lights with me and your mom tomorrow night. What a strange, weird coincidence. So, what do you say? Yeah, we could use the manpower. Why don't you come over about 6:00? I'll make some food. Mm. Perfect. I love food. [Laughing] [] All right, I'm ready for another string of lights. Really, mom? Well, it's been a while since I had someone to help me hang them in here. This was daddy's job. He's been gone a long time. So, thank you, Dean. It is my pleasure. Oh, do you remember that time when daddy was hanging the lights outside, and he slid down the roof? [Beth, laughing] He slid right into the snowbank! I don't remember much, I-- I was only eight when he died, but I do remember that. You know, I think my favorite Christmastime memory with him was, after every Christmas dinner, he would take me ice skating-- [in unison] ...At Rinkorama. And they were open past midnight, so I felt so grown-up. But every year, he would carry you home, fast asleep, into the house by 11:00. I loved those times. Me too, sweetheart. And now we're making new memories. Yes. Yes, we are. Listen, I promise, you have some good food coming to you as reward for all this. No reward is necessary. What kind of food are we talking about here? Thank you for tonight. It meant a lot to my mom and to me. It was my pleasure. But the night's not over. It's not? There's something I want to show you. It's a surprise. Okay... [] [Giggles nervously] Where are we going? You'll see. Watch your step. Okay. [Laughs] What-- [shouts] Okay, we're ready! [] [Beth gasps] Rinkorama? Rinkorama. This is the important phone call you had to make? The owner owes me a favor. I saved his cat. [Laughs] Come on. Let's get you some skates! Ahh, this brings it all back! I didn't realize how much I missed this! You know? All of it. Thank you. This is the most incredible thing anyone's ever done for me. I just want to do whatever I can to make you smile. It's not that hard around you. You make me laugh. I'm glad. You're good people, Dean Hubert. -[She gasps] -Oh! [Both laugh] You got me? -Yeah. -Okay. [] What? I don't understand. I'm not following. [Chuckles] Melinda. Casswell. I-- I don't understand why she couldn't see what she had with you. I mean, guys like you, they don't come around very often. Evidently they do for Melinda, because I heard she has a third husband now. [Laughs] Well, that's her loss. Because I just-- I think that you're the most selfless, caring person I've ever met. Where's all this coming from, Beth? I don't know... this. Tonight. You. You make everything feel right. Well, it's not really me. It's Rinkorama... And Christmas, the ice-- stop. No. It's you. It doesn't matter what was or what might have been. This feels right. You feel right. Dean... [] [Grunts] [] Next, to talk about his career, is the husband of our very own Kern park high school drama teacher. [] [Gasps] [Laughs] Dean. [Carolers]: ...Angels sing glory to the newborn king peace on earth and mercy mild god and sinners... Come on, Beth! Sing with us. Oh, I can't. No, I would ruin it. Are you kidding? We can always use a real Broadway star in the chorus. Hark the herald angels sing glory to the new born king peace on earth and mercy mild god and... Ahem. Oh! Hello there. And to what do I owe this pleasure? And that smile? I came to give this back to you. Oh, no, you keep it. No. I couldn't possibly. It's too special. It showed me a lot, and I'm good. What are you talking about, "special?" I found it in a thrift store. I liked what it represented, and so I gave it to you. So, this didn't... You had all the answers, Beth. And it's cute, no? It's cute. I think it'll look good on you. Thank you. [] Take a step, snap, step. Very good! But where are the rest of my elves? Uh, Greta? Greta, come on. Let's go. All right, and so we dance and we dance and we dance, and then Mrs. Claus sings the line. Mrs. Claus sings the line... Did you forget your line? [Gently] Okay. Sorry. Hey, Dean, want to help me with this ladder? Yeah. I actually wanted to talk to you anyway. [Beth]: Step, snap, step... good. [Dean]: And it just happened last night. At Rinkorama, of all places, but I wanted you to hear it from me. You know, because of all the history. That's ancient history. I know, but if you've got a problem with it, it ends here. No, really, Dean, I'm fine with it. I'm happy for you guys. [Sighs] I just... What's up? Has she mentioned anything about staying in Kern after Christmas? Well, we haven't really gotten that far, you know. It was only one kiss. Right. But just be cautious. Beth has big dreams and a life in New York, and you live here. But hey, I mean, you're a pretty charming dude, not terrible-looking, a worse wrestler than me, but... Who knows? Maybe, uh... maybe she'll stick around this time. Yeah, we'll just see where it goes. That's good. [] Okay, so now that we have our costumes on, let's do this for real. You can do this, Frances. You know, I was nervous when I started performing. You were? [Laughs] Terrified. But I did it and it was so much fun. And I still get nervous when I go onstage, but it's the good kind of nervous. It's an excited nervous. Okay, I'll try to be the good kind of nervous. [Chuckles] Yeah! That's my Mrs. Claus. Should we do it together? Okay. Ready? [Together] Here comes the man-- the man with the plan! Here comes... Santa! That's your cue! [Beth, chuckling] Well, we're gonna need a seamstress. All right, guys. I think we're done for today. Who wants a snack? [Kids all talking at once] Bye. I thought I'd drop by just to see how things were going. You're wonderful with them. You think so? Not to sound like a broken record, but I still haven't filled that part-time drama teacher job. Just let that simmer for a little. Okay. Thank you. You know, that's not a terrible idea. Yeah, well, you know what they say. Those who can't do... Teach. And those who can do, teach incredibly well. [Laughs] Just let me just get through this performance first. [] [Beth]: Yeah, Dean's great. I think you'll really like him. You sound like a new person. I feel like a new person! Although, at the same time... I feel like myself again. So you're glad I talked you into going home? I am. Thank you for my present. [Inhales deeply] It's festive and fun here, and I feel like I'm getting involved. Stress-free. Well, I am back at the apartment. My dad brought his new girlfriend to the Hamptons, and she's perfectly terrible. I got on the first Jitney back to NYC. Well, now you're going to be alone for Christmas. Nah. It's fine. I'm good. A few people from my last show are here, so we're going to go get Christmas dim sum. You could come here for Christmas. Sounds like you're going to be pretty busy for the next four days. I can't intrude on that. But I'll see you when you get back, and you can give me all the gory details. When I get back... [Inhales sharply] Yeah, what happens with this Dean guy when you come back to New York? [] [Shirley]: I'm sure you're doing a great job! Those kids are doing a great job. I'm just teaching them the box-step. And I think they're going to pull it off in time. It's five days till Christmas. If anyone can do it, you can. Here you go, and don't forget to come back. Valentine's day is just a few months away. Okay... What? Do you think I'd make a good mother? Where did that come from? You were an exceptional mother. Thanks, honey. It was just you and me for all those years after daddy died... It wasn't always easy, but I did the best that I could. You were so selfless. You lifted me up, you gave me everything. That's what a mother does. She nurtures her baby so that she can feel free to fly. I just don't know if I would have it in me. Oh, of course you do. I mean... To stay, have a family, live this life. Are you thinking about staying? I'm... Thinking about all kinds of things that I never considered before. Is this because of Dean? It's Dean... It's the kids. I feel like something is opened inside of me. I feel... Good. I never imagined this life for myself. Look, Bethy... Kern may be small, and it may be simple, but I get to walk out my front door, and I know everyone. And when something bad happens, or something good, a hundred people show up at my front door with either condolences or congratulations. I have... More love than I know what to do with. This is home. But that's just it-- I don't know where "home" is. How do you know? How do you really, truly know when it's right? You know because your heart tells you that it is. And your head shuts up. [Laughs] So I was in the fitting with Frances, and she looked at me, and she said, "you're right, it's the good kind of nervous." I love that kid. You're really quiet. Just thinking. Yeah? About anything specific? About this. Us. Do you want to share any particulars? [Sets his drink down] [Sighs deeply] I really like you, Beth. A lot. I can't help but wonder if this is just some sort of holiday thing that's going to end with the new year. What do you think? I am trying not to think so much. I've also been thinking about what principal Hyde said. There's a life and a job for you here... In Kern. I want you to stay, Beth. I'm just worried. About what? About falling for you. And then January first comes around, and you have to go. So... maybe we just shouldn't do this. And what if I do? What if you do what? Stay... In Kern. That would make me really... Really... Happy. [] Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh... That was so perfect! That was so good, you guys! You didn't make one mistake, you didn't miss one note. You're going to be so great for the festival. I'm so proud of you. I'm proud of you! Thanks, Frances. We did it together, right? Okay, I have a surprise for you. In the hall, Mrs. Pratt made gingerbread cookies. Go get 'em. [Kids chattering excitedly] You are doing such a great job with the kids, Beth. We're so lucky that you came home this year. You're doing a great job. The decorations look fantastic. Half the hall looks fantastic. At the rate we're going, I'm starting to think I might have to rope off the other half so no one can see it. Do you need an extra set of hands? I can help. Yes. Please. That would be great. [Laughs] Okay. You can start by helping me hang this tinsel. Yep. Absolutely. Mm. You know... Principal Hyde asked me to work on you to take that job. But I had to break it to him that we will be once again losing you to the glitz and the glamour of New York. Yeah... full disclosure, Eileen? My life in New York is anything but glitzy and glamorous. It's actually been a complete struggle since day one. I'm sorry to hear that, Beth. I know what the theater's always meant to you. You know, I thought it was the only thing I was good at, but I don't know. Maybe I had it all wrong. And maybe you have more gifts than you know what to do with. The way you are with those kids... I don't know, maybe we can convince you to stay. Maybe. I would love that! And I think I know someone else who would really love that. Ahem. Thanks. [] [] Morning. Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ah, no peeking! Five days until Christmas day! Oh, I was thinking about Christmas dinner, and I'm going to make your favorite-- glazed ham and green bean casserole. With the crunchy onions? I cannot believe you would even ask me that. You can't make that dish without crispy onions! It sounds great. Can I invite Dean? Of course. You really like him, don't you? [Laughs] I do. It's funny, growing up, it was always me and Barry. I never really saw Dean that way, but... He makes me laugh. All the time. Makes my day to see you happy. Makes my day to see you happy. Are you? Of course I am! Honey... I love my life. I raised a sweet, compassionate daughter. I get to bake for the people of this town on a daily basis. And this year, I get to have a perfect Christmas with my favorite girl. What more could a lady ask for? Well, what about a boyfriend? Well, um... I-- I-- date. What? Well, uh, oh, occasionally, um, principal Hyde takes me out for a nice dinner to the cobalt buffet. [Gasps] You never told me that! You never asked! I didn't... did I? Honey. That's going to change. I promise. So you... And principal Hyde? The man that wears the same suit every day? That is his work outfit. He wears khakis every time he takes me out. [Both laughing hard] They're very nice. [Chiming] Bill? Beth! Got some interesting news for you. What's going on? Well, I just got off the phone with the director of the Mamet show. It seems the star's understudy slipped on some ice and broke her ankle. She's going to be off it for eight weeks, which means you are on a plane tonight, back to New York, baby! Rehearsal starts 9:00 A.M. tomorrow, and the show opens in four weeks, so you've got to be ready. You did it, Beth! You got the part. [Bill Laughs] Merry Christmas! [] -So, what are you going to do? -I don't know. I don't know, but I have to decide, like, now, because they have me on a flight in three hours. What do you think? It doesn't matter what I think. I have so much to do here-- the festival, the kids... you! We had so many Christmas plans. Dean-- I practically told Dean that I'm staying in Kern. This has always been your dream, Beth. It's Broadway! I just feel like I am letting so many people down. Hey! What have I always told you? Don't you ever apologize for following your dreams. But maybe you do need to ask yourself if this is still what you want. I think I need to go to New York so I can be sure. [] -Hi. -Hey. Can we talk? So for how long? It's four weeks of rehearsal, a six-month run, with a possible extension. [Chuckles sadly] You could come to New York. Like, live there? No... [Words catch, she sighs] I don't know. Yeah, I could come and visit, Beth, but... My life is here. I have a town that relies on me. I can't just up and leave. I know. I hate to even ask it of you, Dean, but I have to go. This is it. This is what I've been wanting my whole life. "Greatness." You know, call me crazy, Beth, but I watch you with those kids and I see greatness every day. What about them? You could direct the show. You've gone to every rehearsal, you are so good with them. They don't want me. They want you. You're the one that inspires them to be great. That is greatness. They just want to perform. They don't care who directs it. I really think that you're underestimating they way these kids are feeling about you, but... I get it. You have to go find out. It doesn't mean that this has to be the end. I don't want a weekend girlfriend, Beth. I want to start a life with someone, a family, a home. Not some long-distance Skype relationship, that goes on for who knows how long, with "a possible extension." I know. I'm sorry. This is not how I intended it to go. I know. Break a leg, Beth. I hope you find that greatness that you're looking for. [] [Nicole]: Hey! Now neither of us will be alone for Christmas! We'll be together! You okay? It was hard... Leaving. Dean? The kids, my mom... They'll be fine. I came in and I wreaked havoc on these people's lives, and I just left. I guess this is what I do. That's not true. I feel like I'm letting a lot of people down and I don't want to be that person anymore. You're doing a Broadway show, Beth. It's what you've always wanted. Enjoy it. You're right. It's a Broadway show. I'm going to try to enjoy it. Try? [] [Beth]: If I'd never gone home for Christmas... [] [Sighs] [] [Beth, reading] "Home is where the heart is." [Line ringing] [Ringing] [Beth]: Hey, Mom. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. I just wanted to call and see what your plans were for the day. Oh, I just finished getting dressed and doing my hair, and I'm going to head over to Marilyn Rowell's house in a minute. Good! Good. Just wanted to make sure you weren't spending Christmas alone. I love you. I love you too, sweetheart. I got your beautiful pendant. Thank you. Sorry I couldn't come home. I know how hard things are for you right now, Bethy. I meant every word on that pendant. Home is a feeling, not a place. No matter where you are, I am always with you. [] [] [] [] Okay, elves and Santa's helpers, we are about to begin one of our last dress rehearsals. Are you guys ready to knock 'em dead? Where's Beth? Beth had a-- a thing in New York. She had a really important work thing in New York, that she had to fly back for last night. Lucky for you, you have me! You know? So... Hooray! [Begins playing "jingle bells"] [Off-key] Well, they don't call me "Beethoven" for nothing. [] [Quietly] You want to step in here? Dean, I'm worse than you... And you are awful. This is not going to work without Beth. Of course it will! You guys are the talent, and you're all so good. We... we want Beth. Yeah! I'm sorry, but Beth's not coming. But you guys are going to be great, because it's Christmas, and that's what it's all about. So everyone, just grab your places onstage. We only have a couple of days, and we've a lot of work to do. [] You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry, man. I really didn't want to be right. I know you didn't. Hey, uh, Eileen's mom plays piano. I'll give her a call. Maybe she'll help out. [] So he says, "it's completely safe! It just depends on your sense of danger." [Men laughing] Oh! Oh... Beth. Thank you for cutting your trip short and coming to join us here. Mm. You know, when Jane broke her arm-- or her leg... What did Jane break? Ah, what does it matter? Anyway, we knew that we had to get you here A.S.A.P. Now, you were my first choice, but the producer writes the checks, and he fought me for Jane. But you're here now and we're thrilled. Thank you. I am very excited to be here. It is an honor to be understudying Alexis Avery. You won't be saying that in a few months, I can assure you. Nine Broadway shows, and I've never missed one performance. Not once. Sorry, doll, but at least you're getting paid. And it's a Broadway credit, right? Yeah. So should I just stand over here, then-- oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. No. You will sit right here, in this chair, and you will watch and you will study every move that Alexis makes in the event that you ever go on for her. That's your job. Easy-peasy, right? [] All right, my lovelies. Let's begin with act three. All right, Jerome, can you come in from upstage left, make your way down to Alexis, David will find you on the couch... [Continues indistinctly] [] [Beth]: It was like I was invisible. I mean, there's no guarantee that I'll ever perform. It felt like... A stepping stone? A waste of time. How can you say that, Beth? This is what you've always wanted. It's a great opportunity. Maybe it's not anymore. What? I feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience. What did that town do to you? It felt like... I was a part of something that mattered... Like I belong there. I belong there. So you're just going to give up? You're committing career suicide. I think I wanted my career to define me so I could feel worthy of this praise that I've been given my whole life. But it doesn't define me. You know, what I did with those kids, that defines me. My family does. Community does. I don't feel like I'm giving anything up. I feel like I'm moving toward something. I need to go home for Christmas Eve. Well, let's get you a flight home, then. [] Beth! You're back. I'm back. It's a long story, but I am here, and I am available, and I want to help with the festival, or however you need me. You haven't heard? Heard what? Come in. I've been on a lot of planes in the last 24 hours-- the festival is canceled. Wait. What? I haven't been gone that long. What happened? Someone set off the sprinklers in the town hall. Everything was ruined. Everything, and we can't even use the hall because we have to wait for it to dry out, which could take a week, more? I don't know. It was a nightmare. Just be glad that you were not here for it. [Sighing] Those poor kids. Yeah, they were pretty devastated. Dean took them to the Rinkorama today, though, to cheer them up. Of course he did. Everyone must be so upset. This is the biggest event of the year in Kern. No decorations, no budget, no location-- no festival tomorrow. Oh. There has to be something that we can do. Wait a minute. It's the inside of the hall that's ruined? Not the outside? The outside is fine, but it's supposed to snow, and we don't have any decorations, not to mention time. It's Christmas Eve tomorrow, Beth. I have an idea. [] [Hum of chatter] [Beth]: I'm going to ask the Rowells if we can borrow their decorations as well. There we go. Careful. ["Deck the halls" playing, instrumental] Careful. [Eileen]: How you got them to deliver this tent 60 miles away the day before Christmas Eve, I don't know. [Beth]: Well, I just told them our story and about the people of Kern, and then I begged, and that seemed to do the trick. And you got everyone, at least on my street and your mom's, to donate their decorations. We owe a lot to you, Beth. Well, it's Christmas, and in Kern, we always have a festival. Which we may just have ready in time for Christmas Eve tomorrow. I hope everyone got their Christmas shopping done, 'cause we're pulling an all-nighter. Not a problem. I do have one more favor to ask of you, though. What's that? [] [] Beth? Hi. Dean. Uh... wh-- [Confused chuckle] What are you doing here? Listen, um, I'm going to tell you everything tomorrow, at the festival. You haven't heard. There's not going to be a festival this year. No, there will be. You'll see. It's going to be different. Better, but different. What are you talking about? Look, can you do me a favor? Read the paper tomorrow? Special Christmas Eve edition. Can you promise me that? Sure. Okay. All right. We'll talk tomorrow night. [] Bethy! Bethy! Wake up! Wake up! It's here! The paper! I waited for the paperboy to get here. Scared the heck out of him! It's here! Okay, I guess I'm up. All righty! "Kern is where the heart is," by Beth Baker. My daughter. "Home is where the heart is. "I didn't realize that, "as I turned my back "on the place that valued and validated me "throughout my childhood. I would leave Kern..." [Overlapping with Beth] "...And set the world on fire." [Beth]: "But Christmas is a time of renewal... of rebirth, so to speak." "and that's exactly what the people of Kern, "and the spirit of this season, "have given me-- my rebirth." [Dean]: "A brilliant mind once told me "that greatness comes in many shapes and sizes. "To me, it always had a huge connotation. Like you had to be Abe Lincoln or Susan B. Anthony..." "But greatness..." [Choking up] "Greatness could be the challenge of raising a child all by yourself..." [Overlapping With Beth] "or the daily production "and distribution of a newspaper... "or running a pharmacy with nothing but your intuition to guide you." "Or being given a firetruck "and entrusted with the safety and well-being of an entire town." "A truly great life is filled with love and family "and those pivotal moments that we get to share. "And Christmas is when we come together "to honor those blessings. "And so... "I humbly offer a replacement Kern holiday festival, "this evening, in front of the town hall, "so we may continue to celebrate this time of year... As only our community can." [Beth]: "I thank you, "the people of this beautiful town, "for helping me find my way back to myself. "I will never stop striving for greatness, "but I understand it now "in ways I never did before. "and only now do I feel truly worthy. Merry Christmas." [Voice breaks] Oh, honey. That's beautiful. Thank you. Ahh, I hope everyone reads it, and I hope they show up. Oh, Beth! Even if they didn't read it, news in this town travels like tumbleweeds. They will show. Ladies! Do you have any more Christmas wishes for me, before I head back up to the north pole? Got a busy night ahead. I think I'm good. [Chuckling] Merry Christmas, ladies. [Together] Merry Christmas, Santa. [] [Kids, with piano] jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh [Squeal of delight] Thank you, everyone, so much for coming. We have tables and tables of delicious treats generously provided by my mother, Shirley Baker, of the Baker's dozen. Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas to you. [Excited chatter] Thank you. Hi. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Can we talk outside? I'd like that. [] [Dean]: It's a nice night. [Beth]: Mm-hmm. I think the only thing that would make it more perfect is if it snowed. I love when it snows on Christmas Eve. Yeah. Me too. I read your article. You have a knack for writing. Maybe Eileen will give you a job on the paper. I think my talents would be better suited elsewhere. I talked to principal Hyde this afternoon. I took the job. You'll be good for them. Uh-huh. They'll be good for me. I mean, it's part-time, but I can stay with my mom, and help out at the bakery from time to time. What? I think I owe you an apology. I was... pretty hard on you. I know what I want now, Dean. Without a doubt. Welcome home, Beth. It's good to be home. [] [] [Boys]: Mommy! Daddy! -Wake up! -He came! -Santa was here! -Santa was here! Okay, okay, I'm up, I'm up. Let's go find out what Santa brought you. [Dean grunts] [] [] Merry Christmas, Beth. Merry Christmas, Dean. []
