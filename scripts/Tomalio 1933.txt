Left face! - Speaking in Spanish - You were gone too long! Come with me, everything is so lovely! Everything is so beautiful. Now you stand here, you see? Make yourself comfortable. Smoke a cigarette. Enjoy yourself! Forget it all! What a beautiful day... for a killing! Get ready! Aim! No, wait a minute! You know that I want music with my killing! Make me mad! Work me into a frenzy! Fire! Good work, my boys! Good work! I love it! Now we all get a big drink! Now listen, pal... Why don't you be reasonable? Haven't I been nice to you? Didn't you have a nice bed last night? And a good dinner? And plenty to drink? Oh, come on... It's only a mile to Tomalio. We can go over there... and you'll have a nice rest. Come on now, let's get going! Why don't you do something to help me? What would you suggest I do with a jackass sitting in my lap? I know what's the matter! This mule don't understand English! What do you say in Spanish to get them going? If I knew, do you think I'd be making a rocking chair of myself for this mule? I'll try this. Tomalio! Senorita! Doggone it! I've spoken all the Spanish I know to him! Giddy up! Why didn't you think of that word before? Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Another bottle of wine. You haven't paid for the last one yet. You dog! You want me to give you money? - Speaking in Spanish - Oh no, General, please. I was only joking! Look, General! I tear up your "you-owe-mes!" Oh, well! This is much different! Here, boy! Come here! Put some here too! Put some here! Good! Put some here, too! I like that! That's enough! Thank you, that's enough. Oh, Pancho! There you are. Look at that! This cup... I'm going to win the race tomorrow, huh? And what a beautiful thing! General, don't you think you should train? That would not be fair to the rest of the racers! I can win the race with one leg tied around my neck. Tomorrow, I'm going to win two prizes, yes? One, the cup of the race and number two... the hand of your daughter, Lolita! Isn't she beautiful! And she likes you too! - Likes me? You said for a month that she loves me! Because I'm cute! Now we have a drink together. For the bridegroom, the winner of the race and the Great Cup! Lolita, you are the most charming girl in all of Tomalio. Fall in! So, this is Tomalio! Yeah, and we're darned lucky to be here with a jackass like that! - Speaking in Spanish - - Speaking in Spanish - - Speaking in Spanish - Serves you right. Just a minute... You are so polite... to my sweetheart! You can be polite to me, too! I mustn't get my little footsies wet! - Speaking in Spanish - Well... I saved your life! Yeah, you saved my life! And I thank you... too much! What's the matter with you? - What's the matter? Now I have to marry him! Why? - If I do not marry him, he will kill you! Kill me? Why, no one's going to harm me down here. Everyone seems so friendly! Oh mister, I'm in great trouble! - What is it? I cannot talk now. You come to my room at midnight. Huh? - Singing in mangled Spanish - You Latins are certainly romantic! What are you doing here? Just doing a wee bit of serenading and things are certainly coming my way! I'm certainly glad they're coming your way and not mine! My poor boy, what is the matter? What's the idea? - You will soon find out! Music! What's the idea of the music? The General always likes this kind of music for his killing. Does music always affect him that way? Stop with that music! What's the matter, General? Don't take it so hard! I can't kill you when I'm sad like this! That's alright, I'm in no hurry. Can you wait a little more? - Sure. Maybe better at 11 o'clock. That's fine, then I can sleep late! You are a good sporting man! You do me a great favor! So long, General! - So long! Wait! Get ready! Fire! Aim! Lolita, why you no in bed? I'm not sleepy. Maybe there is some reason you no sleepy. You expect someone? - No. No? - No! We will see. Oh, General! Lolita's a little bit... nervous tonight. She no can sleep! Why, Lolita... you so sweet! Why you so nervous? You no sleep tonight? Blow on my medal. We play, eh? - Leave me alone! Peeping Tom is what you are! Get up! Close the door! Now that you are in, you can stay in! You see, Lolita is not expecting anyone tonight. But we will wait! And what a surprise he's going to get! Always joking! When someone comes in, cover them with this and give them the works! And you hit them plenty! Give it to him! Why don't you be careful? Here he comes now! Get ready! Lolita! Come on out! You come on in! Lolita... Come on out! Come in! Lolita! Mister President! Mr. President, we did not expect you tonight! The race isn't until tomorrow. That's alright. Arrange quarters immediately! Yes, we always make room for the President! Lolita! You come on in! You come on out! You come on in! Get ready! Go on, go on! Get ready! Alright... One... ...two... ...three! That's alright! It was good! That's all I've got to say, it was good! I wonder who we threw out the window? Only the President. The President! It was all your fault! I show you something! - Speaking in Spanish - Halt! Left face! - Speaking in Spanish - - Speaking in Spanish - Is it a little warm in here? - Just a trifle. Music! Get ready, aim! Fire! Lolita! General, why don't you be a sport and give them a chance? I'll be a sport! What do you want? - Let them run in the race. If you beat him, you kill him. If he beats you, then you spare his life. Well darling, that is only fair chance! He's as good as dead already! Come here, gringo! You know, I like you very much! General, I like you very much! The General, here he comes! Here you are. Take the cup! I win the cup, you give it to Lolita! I have so many cups! The gringo! Forget it! I'm not worried. You're not running either! Snap out of it! THis might be your lucky day! Hey gringo, move over! I want to be in here too, you know! And I give you fair warning... If I don't win the race... I blow the whistle and you know what that means... If the runners are ready to go, I am. Come on! It's looks like Wilbur's going to need a little help! I'll never get through this! What are you trying to do? Beat the General? Come on! Come on, Wilbur! Come on! I can't! I'm all in! Ladies and gentlemen! It gives me great pleasure... You snake in the bush! You cross-doubler! So you will win the race from General Garcia, huh? I'll fix you! And you, too! I'll show you something that you will... I've lost my whistle! Are you sure you've lost your whistle? Look, I'm positive! Right there, General. Let me see now... Give!
