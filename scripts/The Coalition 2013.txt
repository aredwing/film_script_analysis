Yo yo, we here at 1080 holding it down. Shouts to my man Prime. Had an outstanding season, balled his ass off this year and of course... Made the all-star team. (cheers, applause) You know, sometimes we say growing up, it's important to have someone that you look up to, like a role model. And in my case, that was my best friend. You deserve everything you have, my man. You've got a lot of good shit coming your way. Yo, man, nice speech. Come on, seriously. We've been at this thing for a while. And I know we make it look easy, but the shit is really pretty hard. You know what I'm saying? Hey, but we work hard, so we can play hard. - (hip-hop music playing) - (cheers, applause) I'm gonna go to the ladies room real fast. - Okay, you know where it is? - I'm sure it's in the back somewhere. Yeah, back to the right. Tippy-toe, tippy-toe, tippy-toe... Mmm! Mmm! - Fuck that shit. - Hey hey. - No, move, Lonzo. - Don't start. You think I'm gonna stand here and let him disrespect me like that? - Don't start, Autumn. - Please. Please. You need to chill. I'm about to throw you up outta here. Kalif, get the fuck outta here. You think you running shit? You ain't running nothing. You just like one of Prime's hos. Always on his dick, even when he treats you like shit. Yeah, and what you need to do-- take care of your babies, okay? - What is it now? - You leave my family out of this! Three babies by two different baby mamas? - Fuck you, bitch! - Get the fuck outta here, Autumn. - No, you don't tell me what to do. - The fuck you talking about? - Me and you are done! It's over. - Oh, really? Really? - We've been done. - And how am I supposed to know that? Because you were man enough to tell me? And we both know that didn't happen. So, what, I can't come toast the great Optimus Prime? - Is that it? - What is wrong with you, Autumn? - Get her outta here, China. - Get off me! Her shit so good, you gotta shame me in front of all these fucking people?! - Get your crazy ass outta here! - Fuck you! (humming) (phone ringing) - (beeps) - Hello? - (music playing) - Hi, Grandma, just checking on you. Skylar, why are you calling me from a party? Oh God, you should see this place. It's amazing. It's like a million beautiful people here. - What's wrong with that? - I don't know. - Woman: ...fabulous in that dress. - Listen to me, baby. You can't let anyone steal yourjoy. Woman: If he'd just look my way tonight, he's so gonna get it. Woman #2: Wasn't he with someone? Who? Little Miss Muffet? She can't keep a man like Prime. I saw how excited you were to go to that party, so if you're there, be there. - (chattering) - Make them remember your name. No, I'm just gonna come home a little earlier. It better not be because it's time for me - to take those blood-thinner pills. - No, ma'am. (sighs) Honestly, I'd just rather be there than here. All right, baby. I'll see you in a little while. - (beeps) - Hmm. Strike a pose, strike a pose, strike a pose Strike a-- strike a-- strike a-- strike a pose Touch your toes, touch your toes, touch your toes... - Hey, you back. - Long line at the bathroom. - Sorry. - Prime: All right, no problem. (chuckles) Everything okay? - You look like something's wrong. - No, everything's okay. I'm gonna leave, actually. But I thought you were having a good time. I am. I'm having a great time. I don't like leaving my grandmother by herself for a long time. - Mmm. - Sorry. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'm sorry. All right. Let me walk you out. You don't have to walk me out. It's okay. You know what? It's your party, enjoy it. I'll be okay. Just call me tomorrow? Shake it like a tambourine, juicy like a tangerine Glad I got ahold of teen, yeah, she a beauty queen... - A'ight. - Juicy like a tangerine - Glad I got ahold of teen... - Yeah. - (sniffling) - (hip-hop music playing) (crowd chattering) (sniffles) - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm sorry, I just-- I saw you crying. No. I'm sorry. I just-- I had a bad night so... - Sorry. - Are you Prime's new girl? No, we're just friends. - (car approaches) - Mmm. (sighs) You seem like a sweet girl. Be careful. (sniffles) Autumn: Thank you. (R&B music playing) Oh oh I'm tired of being alone When a girl ain't my own to call "baby" My baby Been looking high and low No matter where I go Hey, lady, I can't find my lady So if you see her Could you let me know? 'Cause I need her Before I walk out the door, hey! I think I'm falling in love on this dance floor Tonight tonight The way you move... Let me find out if Prime is a foodie. (chuckles) I'm starving. - Katalina: Okay, what do we have? - Let's see. - We could make sandwiches. - (both groan) - Not so much. - What's that? Jackpot! Lasagna. - Hold on, there we go. - Thank you. Nice. You want some wine? - Yes, please. - (beeps) Figure out how this works. All right. Look at you, knowing your way around a kitchen. - (laughs) - That's hot. - You know how to cook too? - Tsss! There isn't much I don't know how to do, Lonzo. - Thought you'd know this by now. - There, you see, you see? You can't just be sexy, can you? Huh-uh. You gotta be cocky too. Hey, I'm not being cocky. I'm just telling the truth. - Right. - Seriously though, I actually did study under some of the top chefs in Paris for like a year. - Mmm. I love France. - Yeah? I love it. I shot a film there a few years ago. I swear, the food there is like-- - Oh, it's just so good. - Mm-hmm. - It's delicious. - Yes, my mom firmly believes that a woman should be able to cook for her man. Sounds like you have a smart mother. (chuckles) You have no idea. You're absolutely beautiful. You know that? Thank you. - And you can cook? - (laughs) (sighs) Skylar. Just wanted to give you a call, make sure you made it home safe. It was really nice to see you tonight. Yeah. Hey, why don't you give me a call in the morning? Maybe we can grab brunch or something. All right? Sleep well. (doorbell chimes) (knocks) - (sniffles) - What are you doing here? (crying) (R&B music playing) Kalif: Time out. Tell me I didn't throw a kick-ass party last night, man. - (hooting) - Diddy ain't got shit on me. Bad shit-- bad shit, seriously. Lonzo: What I wanna know is where the fuck were you all night? I already told you-- rule #1. What's rule #1 again? ABC-- Always Be Closing. Bingo. Right there, my man. Those rules don't work, man. Come on. Had to close down the Carnegie chick last night. - Yo, how'd she do, man? - She had a Prime Alexander night. 28 points, shot 54 % from the three-point line. - Damn, that's pretty good. - Kalif: That is a good night. - (laughter) - Lonzo: Are you gonna see her again? (chuckles) Nah. I'm already working on my next lottery pick. Lonzo: Of course you are. Hey, hold up. Seriously, what was up with Autumn? That's what I wanna know. Dude, she was tripping all night. Yo, that's Dallas. I told you not to let her ass in the party. She was fine until she saw you kiss Skylar. What? Yo, look, she was crazy from the jump, man. - Red flag. - Lonzo: I told his ass. - Kalif: Amen. - Will you guys relax? - Damn, man! - Dallas: Relax. It's all good. Whatever, man. Yo, anyone else close last night? Well, I had a trez Nathaniel. - Lonzo: A trez what? - Dallas: A dude? A dude? No, man, the two chicks from the pool last night. Man! I'm telling you-- strawberries and wine, candles. (chuckles) It was quite exquisite. I'm feeling that. I'm very happy for you. - What about you, Zo? - Oh, I had a good time, man. Y'all know he was handcuffed to Katalina all night, talking about "I love you, baby. I love you, baby." - I'll fucking kill you. - (laughs) Yo, what's up with you and her, anyway? Man, I don't know. I like her. - I like her a lot. Yeah. - Okay. Okay. You know, just be careful with her. - I will. - Yeah. You know what? Actually, go ahead and let's redesign - this whole setup over here. - The scarves? Yeah, I don't like it. And let's redress her too. - Okay. - Anyway, like I was saying, his tie and handkerchief matched my dress, Prime warned me that I should've put my sunglasses on - in the car, but-- - Ooh! - I know, right? - At night? - (door opens) - Oh! - Hey! - Hi! How are you, girls? - You look so cute. - You too. - Hello. - Hey, Heidi. Hi, honey, how are you? - Super cute. Have a seat. - Thanks. Dylan, do you mind getting us a couple of glasses of wine? - Not at all. - Mm-hmm. So how are you guys doing? - Good. - Good, how are you? - Fabulous as always. - Woman: Of course. So I guess you know why we're here. We need something amazing to wear to the Rico Terrell gala. - Oh, okay. Of course. - And I heard this year it's an all-black affair. I wonder who decided to do that. - Mmm, that's me. - Heidi: Oh, okay. I'll go and get you guys the book and I'll show you what I have coming in next week. - Okay. - Okay? - Ladies. - Both: Thank you. You're welcome. Here you go, sweetie. - Woman: So, Autumn... - Mm-hmm? ...is this the wine that you purchased while you were in San Francisco last week? I wasn't in San Francisco last week. Why? What's going on? - It's probably nothing. - What's probably nothing? Okay, spill it. Jessica said that she saw Prime in San Francisco last week with another woman. And that gossip website said that you were kicked out of Prime's party. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Well, you shouldn't believe everything you read. Okay, first of all I was not kicked out. We had a fight. It wasn't the first and it won't be the last. Okay, and what about that girl that he was kissing at his party? - You know, the one he was all up on? - Oh, you mean the peasant who was rocking last year's rummage-sale collection? - I'm not worried about her in the least. - Ahem! Maybe we could show them the new Norell collection. Mmm! Yes, I am sure one of these beauties can pull off such a stunning dress. (chuckles) You know what? I have work to do, so I'm gonna go. But you ladies shop. - Okay? - Thank you. Okay, um, maybe let's take a look at a few dresses. Do you mind? - Just bring out what you have. - Yeah. - I'd be happy to. - (whispering) Carnegie, if you don't stop checking that phone-- do you think it's gonna ring just because you want it to? I'm just checking the service. Sometimes it gets spotty in here. Uh-huh. Yet I have the same carrier and I'm four bars strong. I know, I know, I know. Why hasn't he called me? You just saw him last night. He's probably working today. I know, I know. It's just... that was the most amazing date. Well, what did he say when he dropped you off? You-- you mean when he left? - So he came in? - Oh yeah. Yeah. - Well... - It was amazing. I'm not even kidding. This is the best date I've ever been on. - Hands down. Hands down. - So you slept with him after dinner and he hasn't called you back. - It's not like that. - Not like what? You're making it seem like because he slept with me he doesn't want to be with me. Well, have you ever gone on this long - without him speaking to you? - I mean... not-- not since we met. It's probably nothing. - You think? - I know. I'm sure you're right. Sounds like you guys have an amazing connection. Now let's get dressed and get some drinks at Duke's. Your phone rings in other places besides the living room. - (knocks) - (door opens) - Hey. - Hey, you. Well, they're gone. (chuckles) - (door closes) - Umm... how you doing? Are you doing okay? (hesitantly) I'm fine. You sure? - Yes, I'm sure. - (both laugh) No, I'm just wondering, 'cause having them catty bitches in your store-- - you know. - Who, Heidi and Shannon? - Yes, Heidi and Shannon. - Oh, I'm not worried about them at all. They will never change. But you know, as long as they continue to shop here, I really don't care. Amen. Umm... so you looking at that website? I don't even know what website they're talking about, so-- - Whobangingwho.com. - And how do you know that? Girl, please, do not let the bougie fool you. You know I keep up on my gossip. (chuckles) My college girlfriend runs the site. (sighs) Umm... I saw these pictures this morning-- Prime kissing that girl. Honey, why didn't you just tell me that you guys were having trouble? Because it's no big deal. - It-- - It's not that serious. - It's serious. - (chuckles) Dylan, I really don't wanna talk about this right now, so-- - (door opens) - Man: Yo yo yo, I got a delivery. - (bell dings) - Umm... (chuckles) I'll get it. (door closes) - Hi, Quenton. - Hi. Dylan, when are you gonna stop playing and let me take you out to dinner? - Huh. - Mmm. Man. - What is this? - It's a delivery for your cousin. - On a Saturday? - Apparently it's a special delivery. - Okay. Right this way. - (chuckles) - (Dylan knocks) Sorry. Delivery. - (door opens) - Oh, hey, Que. - Miss lady. I have a delivery for you. - Are you serious? - (chuckles) - (laughs) - Umm... Are you waiting for a tip? Seriously? You-- - he just asked me out. - Hey, I gotta save up. We all know how you singletary ladies are. - Bye, Que. - Wow. Nuh-uh. Dylan, call me. You won't regret it. I-- I don't even know. What is this? Is this from Milan? What'd you get? Did that say it was from Prime? Maybe it's some new shoes. Autumn? These are-- is this your stuff from Prime's house? - (strained) It looks that way. - He cut up your pictures? Apparently so. Honey, I'm-- I'm so sorry. But this is stupid, okay? This is petty. - Look-- okay, I'm gonna-- - (sobs) I'm gonna take care of this, okay? Yeah, don't-- don't worry about it. Umm, I got it. Okay? (laptop thuds) (knocks on door) (grunts) Hm-mmm, Grandma. I got it. - Mmm. - Whew. - Hi, can I help you? - Miss Hathaway? - Yes. - Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm your driver for today, compliments of Mr. Prime Alexander. Your first appointment is at 1 :00 p.m. My first appointment? Yes, ma'am. I can't tell you where we're going, but I do have a schedule here for your grandmother so she's not worried. So this is one of those scavenger hunts or something. I'm not at liberty to say, ma'am, but I do expect your granddaughter to have a lovely evening. - Gimme one minute. - Not a problem, ma'am. You remember that purse that I lost last year in Vegas? Uh-huh, 'cause you forgetful. Why is that the newer version in purple? - You want it? - I do. I love it. Well, I got a surprise for you waiting at the house. I think you might like it. - Shut up. No, you don't. - I guarantee I do. - Stop! - Right next to the new shoes I got you. Hi, Cash. - Keep it moving. - Baby, come on. Let's go see if they have that bag you was looking at last week. Huh-uh, don't try to change the subject. How the hell does that ho gonna come over here, talking some "hey, Cash," like she knows you like that? - I don't know that girl. - Where do you know that girl from? - Like I said, I don't-- - Where do you know that girl from? Maybe she was at the club or somewhere with Prime. - You know he got groupies everywhere. - Next time you need to tell your little bitches not to come over and talk to you... - My bitches? - ...when they see you with your woman. I'm glad you recognize that. Now can we keep it moving? - No, I'm serious, Kalif. - You causing as scene for nothing. Try me if you think I'm playing. I'm so tired of that simple shit. - I don't care if I'm causing a scene. - Look, I ain't do shit, a'ight? No, you ain't do shit. You think you slick. You think I'm stupid. But I got something for that ass. You wait and see. - See, that's your problem right there. - I gonna find her. You always trying to threaten somebody. I'm not threatening you. That shit was disrespectful. - Come on. You know what? - No. No no no, come here. - Let's go introduce-- - Don't embarrass me in public. - 'Cause you about to get you-- - See, you're always wiling out. This is your first appointment for the day here. When you need me, I will be outside here waiting on you. (R&B music playing) You shine Even on your worst day You're bright Even in dim company You may feel like you don't belong Here You march strong To the rhythm of your own drum I bet you nobody ever told you Where you came from, starchild I know you, I know you well... (cellphone vibrating) Hello. Hey, sexy. Is it too late to call? It's 6:30. - I know. I'm just playing. - (chuckles) So what's up? I thought you were going out with Kalif and Dallas. Yeah, I was, but I have a really big, important meeting on Tuesday and I don't wanna be out drinking with the guys and-- I don't know. I just kinda wanna keep my head right, you know? Wow. Smart guy. I think I like you. Wait, you think you like me? What's up with that? - You don't know by now? - Oh, I know. So what are you doing? Well, that's why I was calling. My family and I are having a little movie night tonight and I wanted to see what you were doing, see if you wanted to roll through. Maybe watch one of those chick flicks my mom's been begging me to watch with her. Okay, so you're telling me that you're spending a Saturday chilling with your mom, watching chick flicks? - How cute. - Mm-hmm. Yeah yeah yeah. Mama's my rock. Wow. Not a lot of people can say that. What do you mean? You're not close to your mom? Let's just say my mom is married and she has children, but "close" isn't a word I use to describe her relationship with anyone. Wow, Katalina. I'm really sorry to hear that, honey. So what movies does your mom have on the lineup? Oh, we've got "Love and Other Drugs," and "Good Will Hunting," of course. Oh, my vote is definitely for "Good Will Hunting." I love me some Matt Damon and Cole Hauser-- good old Boston bad-asses. - Mm-hmm. - So, 20 minutes? Awesome. That's perfect. Okey-dokey. Just so you know, I look a little crazy. I definitely was curled up in a ball reading a book in some sweats. Oh. Oh, my bad. I see what you're doing. Okay. That's right, you're fishing for compliments right now. We can play this game. No, you know what? I can't even-- you are-- you are naturally beautiful from head to toe, so-- Thank you, very very sweet of you. All right, well, drive safe, honey. Okay? - Okay. - I'll see you soon. - Bye. - Bye. - (gasps) - Well? Oh my-- ooh, that is soft. I know. I was surprised to find that your hair's still natural. You know, you have so many options when it is. So I wanted to soften up your curls a bit. It's absolutely beautiful. Thank you. Oh wow. So how long have you been dating Prime? Oh, I wouldn't call it dating just yet. Only we met a few months ago, so we've hung out a few times. But I like him. He's really nice. - Really? - Uh-huh. So all the things you hear about the great Optimus Prime-- - it isn't true? - You know, to be honest, I wouldn't have a clue as to what they say about him. I moved out here to take care of my grandmother, so she's been my main focus. All that matters is that he's nice to me. So you're not one of those jersey chasers running behind him because he has all those millions? Definitely not one of those. (chuckles) I don't know. Maybe it's just me, but... I'm more concerned about how a man treats me than what's in his wallet. You know? I actually had a run-in with a few of his admirers the other night at the club. (chuckles) Just being in a room with those women made my skin crawl. I would totally understand if he had trust issues dealing with those type of women, just throwing themselves at him. Yeah, you'd be surprised, honey, they're everywhere. That's why I make it my business to find out if these girls are dating my brother for the right reasons or because he's a pro basketball player. Prime is your brother? Milan Alexander at your services. (chuckles) I had no idea. I-- I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything, honey. You've said enough. I'm just happy to find out that my brother's with someone who's with him for the right reasons. You're a sweetheart. Keep it that way. And don't break his heart. - (hip-hop music playing) - (engine revs) So what's up, baby? Baby, come on. - You know we be off the hook, baby. - Shanita: Kalif! Kalif! - Hold on. Oh shit. - Who the hell plays basketball this damn late at night? - You better have your ass back by 9:00! - Yo, come on, man, go! I'm not playing with you, Dallas! Mira: Why can't you just find somebody else tonight - and have a little fun? - Carnegie: No one gets me like Dallas. Oh God, nobody gets you-- okay, what does he tell you? - I mean-- - Carnegie: I mean-- Mira: I don't know. This guy sounds like he's kinda full of it. Carnegie: No, but you're always negative like this. Every time I like somebody, you jump down my throat. You gotta go with my gut. And my gut is I really like him. Okay, go with your gut. What about your heart? My gut-- oh, Chad's working. Probably get some free drinks. - Isn't that Dallas? - (gasps) Let's go! Oh, wait wait wait wait. He's with a girl. (rock music playing) (laughs) No no, that's probably like his friend or his cousin or something. It's all right. That's-- that's definitely-- definitely-- - Let's go investigate. - Umm... Sorry. Excuse me. Just-- excuse me. Just trying to get to my boyfriend here. Excuse me, guys. - Dallas: To a lot of luck, baby. Whoo! - All: Whoo! Dallas! Dallas! Hey. Oh hey, Carnegie. What are you doing here? I was gonna ask you the same thing. Excuse me, guys. Work that body, get your sexy on... Dylan: He should be embarrassed. - He's acting like a child. - Honey, I was dragged out of a club-- dragged out of a club by two people holding me down. It was embarrassing. - It was very embarrassing. - I wish I was there. Look, Carnegie, you know I don't want anything, right? I'm a single man. I'm not looking for anything serious right now. Whoa. Umm... I wish you would've told me that last night, because I didn't get that memo when you were in my bed. To go through that by yourself, that's not-- - What? - That's Dallas. I'm sorry you feel like that. I thought we were just hanging out, enjoying each other's company. - Carnegie, come on, let's go. - Yeah well, I didn't know that, Dallas. Okay? And the only reason why you're in the clear is because you never mentioned the word "relationship" when you were wining and dining me and bringing me my favorite cupcakes. You're in the clear because you could do whatever you want and my feelings is no consequence to how you feel! He's doing the exact same thing that Prime did to you. Why do they all act like that? Why do they get to get away with that? - They won't. They won't. - You got what you wanted, and now you're done. Right? Is that how it goes? - Is that how it goes? - Come on, Carnegie, let's go. - Let's go. - Listen to your girl. Screw you, Dallas! - (crickets chirping) - (car door shuts) Nice. 20 minutes, huh? - Two hours later... - (chuckles) Whatever. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. - Who's this little princess? - This beautiful thing is my niece. - Hello there. - Hi. - She's so precious. - She's so cute. Are you ready to go inside? They have been waiting to meet my beautiful girlfriend all day. - Your girlfriend? - Did I say something wrong? No, babe. Girlfriend is just fine. I like that. Come on. My name is Katalina too. Hi, family. This is Katalina, everyone. Katalina, this is my family. Lonzo, don't have her thinking you were raised by wolves. Oh, here we go. That's my sister. Nice to meet you, Katalina. I'm Susie. - Nice to meet you, Susie. - This is my father, - Mr. Juan Rodriguez. - Mr. Rodriguez, a pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you too, Katalina. Hope you don't mind. I brought some cake for dessert. Oh, I don't mind. What kind of cake do we have? It don't matter what kind of cake it is. You ain't having any. What do you mean I'm not gonna have any? A man should be able to have cake in his own house if he wants to. - Yeah, that's-- that's my family. - That's my cake. - Yeah. - (both laugh) - (rattling) - Carnegie, come on! Come on, you cannot let him embarrass you like this! Don't let him win! He's such a fucking asshole! Are you gonna come out? Come on, Carnegie! She's right, you know. You need to pay him back for what he did to you. I'm sorry, but that was ridiculous. Um, who are you? My name is Autumn, I used to date one of Dallas's friends, Prime, and he embarrassed me in the exact same way that he embarrassed you. - Carnegie. - (crying) What did you say? I'm sorry. I saw that back there and that was ridiculous. I cannot believe he did that to you. - It is not right. - Why does this always happen to me? I always fall in love with assholes. Autumn: Look, Dallas, Prime, Lonzo, Kalif-- all of them, that whole little crew-- they're dogs, okay? They don't give a shit about anyone else but themselves. - Everything okay? - Yeah. - I feel so stupid. I feel-- - Mira: No. - Yes, I feel stupid. - Do not blame yourself. I'm sure he wined and dined you, - did all that sweet shit. - Cupcakes. Autumn: That's what they do. Look, honey-- - I'm so sorry. - Carnegie: Thank you. It's a game to them, okay? They don't care about who they hurt in the process. It's not even about the sex to them. They just wanna conquer as many women as they can and they don't care who gets hurt in the process. Trust me. Times like these, I'm glad I do women. Look, if I were you, I would confront him. I would let him have it. I mean, did you see his smug ass out there? All those guys out there, they think he's a hero. And those women? They still will talk to him because they think it's something you did. They never think it's something they did. Dylan: You didn't deserve that, no matter what. - He doesn't even care about you. - Not at all. - Carnegie: Hm-mmm. - We've gotta do something. Don't let him get away with this at all. - Okay. Okay. - Autumn: At all. - Dylan: Yeah. - All right, I'm gonna go out there. Yes! Dry your eyes. - All right, you look cute. - I'm going. Okay. Skylar: Are you guys sure about this dress? It's cut really low. Miss Hathaway, are you in the dress? Yes. - Are you in the shoes? - Yes. Then get the hell out of my dressing room - so we can see you. - (curtain slides) - You look fantastic. - (softly) Beautiful. Come come. You did it. (laughs) Absolutely beautiful. Vidal, you did this. - Yes, I did. - Oh my God, it's so beautiful. Oh, wait wait wait, don't forget about the purse. - Oh, I don't have a purse. - Of course you do. - That is so beautiful. - Isn't it? - You know, you guys are so-- - No no no no, yeah yeah yeah yeah. - Both: We know. - Get going. - Thank you. - Put in a good word for us. (crickets chirping) - (whispers, gasps) - You're welcome. (laughs) Oh. I have had the most amazing day of my life. Well, you deserve it. I mean, I know taking care of your grandmother can't be that easy. Wow. Now come on. The night has only begun. (mouths) - (chattering) - (whispers) Oh shit. She's coming back, she's coming back. I can't believe all this shit. So how do you know our mutual friend Dallas? - Excuse me? - Carnegie: Well, let's see. You're having drinks at his favorite place to be seen, so you must be new. He took me here on our second date. We snuggled in a booth over drinks. Has he brought you pastries yet? Oh, I'm sure he's asked you all about your favorite things by now, huh? Mmm! I love that bracelet. Let me guess, let me guess. He said it reminded you of him when he got it, because it's dainty, just like your wrist. Mine's gold. He gave it to me before we walked in here last time. Hey, yo, you balling like that, man? But don't worry. He's not gonna try anything tonight, because the sex won't be good enough until you're hooked. He likes sweet kisses that he feels are escaped-- well, that's what he told me at least. But from the look of it, you got about 10 more days of access to him and then he'll fuck you like he fucked me last night. - (Kalif laughs) - And then there's no more phone calls just to hear your voice. He's gonna make it seem like you did something, and he's gonna act like you're a psycho if he runs into you in public, make everybody think you're some stalker girl he just can't break. Well, he told me that about the girl before me. I'm sure he told you the same thing about me, right? Carnegie, what are you trying to prove here? Just trying to get it off my chest, Dallas. I'm just trying to get all the facts straight. You know what I mean? Because you're fucking good. You're really good. You should be an actor like Lonzo. You would win an Academy Award, hands down. Hands down. Ooh! I'll take one of these. The least you can do is buy me a drink. Mmm mmm! That's good. Real smooth. Real-- mmm. Mmm, but then it leaves this bitter taste in your mouth. Mira: Ooh! That was awesome! - You go, girl. - Dylan: Oh my gosh, it was. Yo, hey, let me help you, bro. (laughing) Hey, you know-- Oh, I ain't never gonna let you hear the end of this. Very classy, Carnegie. Thank you! (R&B music playing) (silent) Baby, you're perfect I love your style I must admit, girl It drives me wild The way that you walk The way that you dress I haven't met one girl That compares to you yet You treat me so good You've captured my heart Ain't nothing in this world That could pull us apart You say that you love me And I hope that it's true 'Cause I must admit, girl That I love you too She says that she's in love with me I hope that it's true, girl 'Cause I love you too, girl She says that she's in love with me I hope that it's true, girl 'Cause I love you too, girl I want this forever How can I lie? And all of your love, girl It gets me high You take me to places That I've never been I don't want this feeling To ever end You're sexy, you know it And you let it be seen And you look like the girls In the magazines You say that you love me And I hope that it's true 'Cause I must admit, girl That I love you too She says that she's in love with me I hope that it's true, girl. - Carnegie: Try to keep your lips-- - Katalina: Mm-hmm, exactly. - Those earrings are really cute. - Really? - I wanna steal them from you. - My mom bought them at your store. - She did? - Yes, those are our spring line. - Learn your line. - Vidal: Wait wait wait wait. First of all, that's not my job. Thank you. Vidal: Please. Sweetie, you need to come to my place and I'll hook you up with a nice dress to go along with 'em. - Katalina: Thank you. - You know what? Huh-uh. Do not try to steal my clients, all right? - Please. - Thank you. Now how's your mom doing? I haven't seen her in a while. She's doing so good. Her and my dad actually just got back. - They were away for three weeks. - Really? - Shopping. Shopping. - Yeah, shopping. Paris Fashion Week. That's when my family suddenly - needs to get international as well. - Exactly. - Vidal: OMG. Excuse me! - Katalina: Big shot with all her-- - Miss Hathaway! - Who are you yelling at? - Vidal: Miss Hathaway! - Katalina: Who is that? - Vidal: You just wait and see. - Who's that? - Who is it? I don't know. - Skylar: Oh my God, Vidal, - I was gonna call you... - Prime's new girlfriend. ...tomorrow and say thank you for everything. - How are you, sweetie? - I'm good. Wait, what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be having breakfast in bed? No, I'm here to pick up a to-go order for my grandmother. Where are my manners? Ladies, this is Skylar. - Skylar, this is Katalina... - Hi. - Carnegie... - Hi. What was your name again, baby? - Mira. - Yeah, mirror-- get one. (scoffs) I could break you in two, man. - Hello. - Hi. This is Dylan and that's Autumn over there in the corner. Hi. I remember you from the other night. - Hi. - Nice to see you again. Wait a second. How do you two know each other? We ran into each other the other night at Prime's party. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Grab a seat, sweetie. Your food isn't ready. - Oh, thanks. - Vidal: Grab a seat. Well, how did it go? Tell me all about it. - Oh, ladies. - What? I had the pleasure of dressing Miss Skylar for the fabulous evening with Mr. Prime Alexander. - (soft chuckle) - Okay. - Wow. - That's really-- A date, huh? - Mm-hmm. - You have a good time? Oh yeah, it was really nice. I mean, we just went and had dinner, walked in the park. Vidal: Please, don't try to downplay it. She got the works-- hair, makeup, everything. And then he sent her to my place to pick out a fabulous outfit. - Mira: Wow. - Vidal: Mm-hmm. - Wow. - Sounds quite familiar. Reminds me of Dallas. I hate him. Dylan: You had a nice time, huh? Yeah, I did. He's absolutely the sweetest guy I've ever met. - He's just really nice. - (guffaws) (Carnegie laughs) Wow. The biggest sweetheart ever? - Autumn: Dylan. - No, I mean, wow. Well, you know that Autumn dated Prime and he wasn't the biggest sweetheart to her near the end. So... it's weird. Huh? No, I mean she should know. She should know what she's getting into, right? Look look. We don't even know her and we don't even owe her anything to even explain what happened with Autumn, make her relive the experience, so... I don't think we really need to explain anything. I'm gonna let you guys eat your lunch. Thanks. Skylar, wait. Look, I'm sorry. She's my cousin. I get a little protective. But I do think that you should know what you're getting yourself into before you go too deep. Please stay. Honestly, I really didn't know. If you don't mind me asking, what happened? That's a very good question. Honestly, I don't know what happened. We got into this fight, and then the next thing I know he's like cursing me out in public, throwing my things out, calling out my name. It's just-- what I thought was a little fight was the end of my relationship. Is that what happened the other night? Yup. (sighs) I wish someone would've given me the heads up about Dallas. I hate that motherfucker. I really do hate him. I'm sorry. I hate him. - Hate him. - I'm sorry. Who's Dallas? He's one of Prime's friends. (sighs) Seriously, just like Autumn, for the first couple of months he was like a fucking unicorn. I mean, calling two, three times a day, emailing-- the whole nine. Then I spent the night with him and guess what. The whole next day, nothing. So Mira and I go to the bar, get a few drinks. And he is cuddled up with some other chick wearing the exact same bracelet he gave me. So anyways, I confronted him and he basically had me in the bathroom crying. And that's when Mira and Autumn were like-- I'm sorry, Dylan was there too, sorry-- "Go out there and confront him. He's out there having a great time with those girls." She actually looked like a hooker. Anyways, so I went out there and I called him out on his shit. I handled some business, didn't I, girls? - She did too. - Carnegie: I did. But that's exactly what she should've done, because those guys-- they do it to everybody, they get away with it and nobody says anything. Dallas, Kalif, Prime-- - I don't know about Lonzo. - Birds of a feather do flock together. - Hey, watch it. - Carnegie: Yes they do. - We don't know. We don't know. - They do. - We need to put a stop to it. - Mira: That's like saying I'm drinking as much as this one over here. - Girl, you go. - What? Really? Birds of a feather flock together? - Cut off. - I'm celebrating. - I'm celebrating. - Oh, hold on. Look, all the ladies are trying to say is just be careful. That's all. Okay. Thanks. I'm gonna go. It was nice meeting you ladies. - I'm sorry if we-- - Katalina: Nice meeting you too. - Just letting you know. - It was-- yeah. - Just take care. - Thanks. How is it that you're not like Kalif, Dallas and Prime? What do you mean? (snorts) Look, I've known you guys for a while now and you know they're shady. I wouldn't even talk to you if I thought you were like them. - Katalina, they are not shady. - Tsk. They're not. I'm telling you. Look, I've known those guys my whole life, practically. I met Prime when I was eight years old, for crying out loud. I used to be taller than that fool back then. - (snickers) - I swear to God. - Then we met Kalif in high school... - Wow. ...and Dallas in college. They're good guys. Their problem is they love women. What's so bad about that? Okay, but... let's say a girl really really likes a guy and she's in it for all the right reasons. - Mm-hmm. - They're just chilling, seeing where things go. And they finally sleep together, then he dumps her. Someone that does this repeatedly... - Mm-hmm. - ...that's a good guy? That's not fair. It's not. - Mm-hmm. - It's not. Besides, Autumn brought that shit upon herself. - You know that. - I know for a fact that Autumn is not the only woman he's done that to. Okay okay, first off-- first off-- you can't say that. It's a completely different situation, babe. All right? Think about it. They were dating for over a year. - Right? - Yeah. Okay, and he was really good to her. Look, regardless of all this crap, that's their life, right? What happened between them is between them. I'm cool with that. (both chuckle) Look, what you need to be focusing on right now is not what Prime and Autumn were doing. (Katalina laughs) Mmm, it's that you will never do that to me. - You understand me? - (sighs) You know I won't, baby. - You promise? - I promise. C'mon. (chuckles) (sighs) (birds chirping) - What are you doing here, Autumn? - Nice new car. Yeah. What are you doing here? (sighs) Why haven't you returned any of my phone calls? I tried to contact you for over a month now. I got your emails, I got your messages, - but Prime insists that we don't speak. - (laughs) And being that things are really good with us... - Ah. - ...I don't think that we should either. Okay. Oh, I see. Look, I'm not trying to tell you anything. Okay? I just have something you simply need to see. - We'll just take a short ride. - (laughs) It won't take long and I will never bother you again. Okay, you're crazy if you think I'm going anywhere with you. No one asked you to. You have a fancy new car. Follow me. Trust me, you'll wanna see this. (hip-hop music playing) (car door opens) (people chattering) (kids playing) Okay, so you brought me to a kid's birthday party. Autumn: Look a little bit closer. Prime: Now shoot. Shoot. Oh! I think we gotta get it again. Come on. All right, there you go. (laughs) Oh, good job, little fella. - Dallas: Guys, hey. - Prime: Go on wit' your mommy. Woman: Let's go. Hey, Skylar, Skylar, you don't wanna do this right here. Hey, wait a sec, wait a sec. Wait. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. - Prime: Skylar, Skylar. - Really? Really, Prime? - Look, baby, I can explain. - Explain what? That you have a wife? That you have kids? - Uh... - How are you gonna explain this? - I can't. Not here. - (crying) I trusted you. Everybody tried to warn me and I trusted you. You know what, Skylar? Please, - let me take you home. - Stop stop. Look-- What is wrong with you? Why would you do this? I'm not one of these groupie girls out here trying to trap you. - Why would you treat me like I was one? - Skylar. Baby, listen. Look, let's just talk about this later. All right? Just-- it's not what it looks like. I have listened to everything that you said, every single thing that you have told me. I listened and I believed you. What is wrong with you? You have a family, Prime. You have a fucking family. - Prime: Uh... - I hate you. (guitar ballad playing) Looking back it's all clear to me Should have known it all along... I trusted him. Like... I did everything that I could for him, and he still did this. They always win. At least you found out now and not like a year from now. Listen, you two are much stronger women than I am. If I had been at that birthday party, ooh, no, some people would've gone down. I mean kids, baby mamas, like the jumping castle-- something. But she still can. So can we. They humiliated us publicly. Let's do it to them. I don't know, Carnegie. - Mira: How? - Just think, okay? Prime always has a million cameras in his face. So call him out on his shit like I did with Dallas. You really think that that worked? You thought that did something? I'm sorry, but he's probably been with at least three women since you. I hate him so much. I don't know what I even saw in him. He has a unicorn tattoo. He probably waxes his butthole. (women laugh) Look, what are you trying to get out of this? Honestly, what are you trying to propose that we do? I mean, I get why you're angry and why Skylar's pissed, but... Oh, so I don't have a reason to be hurt, Katalina? Is that it? Really? I mean, come on. Autumn, you knew that Prime had a fiance. So it's not like it's some surprise to you. Okay, fuck that. No one really cares what you have to say. Okay, boo boo? And first of all, yes, I knew he had children, and no, I did not know he had a fiance. And when I finally found out, he told me that he was no longer with her, so-- No, exactly. And doesn't Kennedy live in Louisiana or something? - Exactly. - Dylan: If he told her that they weren't together anymore, why wouldn't she believe him? So you thought you would be the one to change him, when he's the type that wouldn't change for anyone, unless he was forced to. Okay, that's like not expecting a scorpion to sting you. Okay, you know what? I am not gonna justify my feelings for any of you, especially you. - The point is that you stayed! - (laughs) You stayed! Look, we all know the risk of dating an athlete, especially Prime Alexander. But I didn't. I didn't know. What did I do? What did I do that was - so bad that I deserve this? (crying) - Nothing. I gave Prime a year of my life. All the broken promises. (laughs) He sold me on this idea of like a fairy-tale life. Where's my happy ending? (chuckles) You know what? How much do we have to put up with before they realize that they can't just break our hearts and pretend like nothing happened? - Katalina: But that's Prime Alexander. - Oh my God. And nobody is going to change Prime Alexander! Autumn: Unless we force him to. What they did to us was cruel and it was wrong. And they need to be held accountable for their actions. Look, you can't make somebody change that doesn't want to change. - You just can't. - Dylan: Yes, you can. Listen, all you have to do is use everything about them against them. Quickly, without remorse. They get their strength from running in a pack like dogs. You shake up the bonds, destroy the pack. Exactly. Skylar: You're right. Let's do it. (sighs) Hi, yes, I'm with Pryor Lamborghini and we have a lease on a car that's in arrears that needs to be picked up. Yes, I know exactly where it's going to be on Saturday. The license plates read "work"-- W-O-R-K. - Yes. - Carnegie: Hello? Hi, I'd like to report someone. I know seven women he's given herpes to-- well, probably more than that. His name? It's Dallas Lauderdale. Yeah, I'll hold. Mira, it's your turn! (cellphone vibrating) - Hello? - Shanita? This is Shanita. This is Mr. Prime Alexander's publicist, Dahni. Okay. Prime is setting up a special surprise for Mr. Kalif Wyatt at the upcoming Rico Terrell gala and would like you to attend. - Okay. - Great! He'll send a car for you at 8:00 p.m. on Saturday. And he asks that you keep this a secret. Thank you. (laughs) Now this is completely anonymous though, right? I mean, you're my girl and I'm sending this to you 'cause I want you to get the scoop, but I can't have this traced back to me. Okay. Are you ready for this? Well, have you heard a little rumor about Kalif Wyatt and his very very close boyfriends? Gay clubs and stripping. And, honey, I have a picture, and I am sending it to you right... now. (laughs) You are welcome. Girl, you're my sorority sister. I gotta hook you up. (laughs) Hell yeah, you can come through. You gotta bring a friend though. Yo, I gotta get out of this mall, girl. I'm feeling all eyes from all guys. - Holy shit. Hey, Kalif. - This is crazy. - Yo, hold up. - What? Kalif? Yo, how you know my name, little man? Oh, baby, I make it a point to keep up with all the available ass out there. What? What the hell you talking about, man? Please, like you haven't been on whobangingwho.com. - Who what? - They got the whole expos, exposing your love for the boys. Love for the boys? Man, I'm all about the ladies, and the ladies know it. Ask your girl, she know. - What? Excuse you. - I'm just going based off what I read. What you read? You read wrong, homey. Who what? Yo, look, I don't know what the hell y'all talking about. I'm out. I feeling too much of a sugar rush - in this motherfucker. - Let's go. Dallas. - Yeah, Dad? What's up? - What the hell is this? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - It's you, isn't it? - Well yeah, but I don't know whose cam-- Oh, yes you do! I'm telling you, I have no idea how it got there. This is going to kill your mother. It's all over the Internet! It's in everybody's inboxes. You need to get out of here, take one or two months. Just get out of here! - I swear, Dad, I-- - No. Dallas, we're done. (mutters) Fuck. (phone ringing, vibrating) Crap. - Yo. - Dallas: Somebody emailed everybody at my dad's company my game tapes, and he damn near fired me! - Wait. What? - How did it get out there, Prime? Yo, man, why you asking me? I don't know. I don't be watching your game tapes. Autumn. What? Nothing, man. Lemme call you back. Yeah, whatever. Where is she? Hi. May I help you with something? Where is Autumn, Dylan? I'm sorry. She's not here. Why? She knows why. You tell her I know she did it. Did what? (door opens, shuts) Hmm. Well. So it begins. That's gonna be $2,476.32. - All right. - Mr. Prime, good to see you again. V-dog, good to see you. You look good. - I see you built a wing on the back. - Yeah. This place looks great. I love it. - Thank you. - Oh, um, Mr. Alexander? - Yeah? - I'm sorry. Your credit card declined. (laughs) Why don't you just swipe that again for me? - I already ran it twice. - Camille, swipe it again. I'm sure there's a computer glitch or something. - It's been doing that lately, you know? - Yeah. (sighs) Yeah, see? It declined again. Do you have another card? - Let me do it. - Okay. Thank you. - Give me two seconds. Not to worry. - No problem. - Yeah... - It was declined. Yo, what do you mean it was-- that's a limitless card. There must be a problem with the bank. - I-- - Gimme that. - Vidal: I'm sorry. - Yeah. Katalina: What are you laughing at? You looking at me like I'm crazy. No, come on. I'm delirious, - I'm so hungry right now. - Clearly. - How's the food? - Is that good? - Mm-hmm. - Kalif: Oh my God! - Oh shit! - Oh my God. Babe! - Shit! - (laughs) - Was that Kalif? - That ass-- was that your boy Kalif? - He was naked. - Yo. Please call that man. What is he doing? Why-- He's on something. Yo, that-- did that really just happen? - Am I bugging? - Hey! Dawg, I swear to God we just saw some dude that looked just like you run down the street - with his balls flapping, bro. - No bueno. We're at the restaurant we always hang at. (birds chirping) - Good look in the clothes, man. - Dawg. Can't believe that shit happened. (Lonzo claps) Yo! What up, brothers? The fuck wrong with y'all? Hey, did I see you running down the street naked? Oh shit, man! What? You saw me and you didn't even try to help me?! - That was you? - We supposed to be boys, man! (laughs) Dude, I tried calling you. What the hell? Tried calling me? Did it look like I had my fucking phone on? Look! I need to know right now-- did one of y'all let out my game tapes? - Lonzo: What? - Somebody uploaded on the Internet, emailed to everyone in my company's directory. Ah. My mom-- fuck, she's gonna kill me. - (sighs) - Prime: Something ain't right. How the hell all of us gonna have a bad day all at the same time? Flames been hounding me all week! And now this shit? What the fuck happened to you? - All my cards were canceled. - Lonzo: What? $100-million man and I ain't got no money. What kind of shit is that? All this can't be a coincidence, can it? All right, look, I don't know what the fuck is going on right now, but we've got this gala in a few hours, right? Dude, we've gotta get our minds right for that. - (crowd chattering) - Woman: Mr. Alexander! Mr. Alexander, over here, please. Prime! Over here, please, sir. A really quick interview. Thank you so much, sir. Mr. Alexander. - Hi, how are you doing tonight? - Great. - Wow, you look really great. - Thank you. So this is the 5th Annual Rico Terrell Benefit Gala for sickle-cell anemia. What makes this such an important cause for you? Well, when I was a rookie, I volunteered at the children's hospital and I met so many amazing children who suffer from this disease. And I vowed right then that I was gonna do all that I could to help fund research to find a cure one day. And I kept my word. That is awesome. How much have you raised this year so far? Well, at this point with this event, we've raised $3.5 million. Congrats. That's truly a great accomplishment. Oh, and next year we'll do $5 million. Wow. Thank you so much for your time. - Enjoy the rest of your evening. - Thank you. (hip-hop music playing) (silent) So what's up, baby? Yo, deal me out. - Kalif. Surprise. - (grunts) Baby? - Yeah. - What are you doing here? Mmm, Prime set all this up. He wanted to surprise you. - Oh my gosh, this place is beautiful. - Tell me about it. You know he always got a trick up his sleeve. No, I mean, he didn't really set it up. His publicist did. But anything for my baby. You know I was gonna be here. Well, baby, I'm glad you here. Look, I gotta work the room, so why don't you go to our table? I'll be there in about 10 minutes, all right? All right, sweetie. Go do your thing. - Hey, baby. - What? - I love you. - I love you too. (mutters) Oh shit. - Yo, Prime, what's up, man? - What's up, bro? - Your publicist invited Shanita? - No, why the hell would she do that? Shit, I don't know. I'm trying to figure that out myself. Man, she right over there. Oh shit. I need a drink, man. Somebody give me a drink. Please. Quick. Make it fast. Yo Come on. Just chill, man. It's good. Just chill out, man. Oh shit! Man, the party's over. I knew your ass was behind all this shit. - Gentlemen. - It's pretty fucked up, Autumn. Prime: So all of you are behind all this shit, huh? I'm sorry. I don't know exactly what you're talking about. My credit cards, Dallas's video. Calling my baby mama. - Shit is real cute. - Okay, you know what? We're just here to have a good time, just like everybody else. - Okay. - Okay. All right. Have fun. Can I speak to you for a second? (whispers) Okay. What do you want, Prime? Look, I just wanna... explain myself. Explain what? That you have a wife and kids? (scoffs) Hey, but, Sky-- I've been waiting a lifetime for you I would do anything just to keep you But you don't seem to care about this thing called love The fellas think that I'm crazy... (guys whispering) - Prime Alexander? - Yeah, what's up, man? - You got a black Lamborghini? - Yeah. Your car being towed outside, playboy. - Prime: Say what? - Man: Your car's being towed. Kalif: Man, come on. I'll be right back. I'm gonna-- Dallas Lauderdale? - Yes. - I'm Officer Suggs. We've received some complaints that you've been spreading sexually-transmitted diseases. I'm gonna need you to come with me - and answer a few questions. - Kalif: What? - Dallas: Are you kidding me? - Sit down. I'm not going with you. - Ah! Hey hey hey hey! - Sit down! - Come on, man. - (handcuffs clicking) - Hey hey! - Lonzo: What did he do? Kalif: I'm telling you, man. It's them bitches. - Lonzo: It's okay. I'll get my lawyer. - Hey. Ah! Yo, hey. Hey, Lonzo, Lonzo, just call my mother. - I got it. - Aww. Bye, Dallas. Kalif: Shut the fuck up, Autumn. (crickets chirping) (knocks on door) (sighs) (man vocalizing) Sleeping with the enemy Apparently I like it Everything she give to me But I can't deny it Can anybody save me? I'm crying out for help I just don't want to lose myself At all Drinking from the bottle Didn't want wanna end like this At all... - Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yes! - Didn't want to end like this... What? - This is fucking bullshit. - (vibrating) Come on, come on, come on. Anchor tight around my feet Yeah, but we pretend we're swimming Love ain't in the deep And continuously we're sinking Can anybody save me? I'm crying out for help I just don't wanna lose myself At all Drinking from the bottle Didn't want to end like this At all... Loving a girl like this I kiss your lips... Get out. Prime: What? Get out. I want you to leave. I want you out of my house. (scoffs) Baby. Get out of my house! (crickets chirping) At all... (crying) Drinking from the bottle Didn't wanna end like this At all Loving a girl like this A kiss from the devil's lips... (birds chirping) - Mmm. - (cellphone buzzes, rings) (sighs) (chattering) - Hey. - Hey. (chuckles) I was surprised to hear from you. I was surprised that I texted you. Mm-hmm. Here you go. - Thank you. - Welcome. (clears throat) So? I'm not ready to forgive you for what you did. I gave you everything that I had and you really hurt me. Why didn't you just tell me you had kids and a girl from the jump? Um, I thought you would leave if I did. That doesn't give you the right to take that choice from me. You're right. I'm sorry. I guess I wasn't thinking. You said that everything isn't what it appears. So explain. My kids mean everything to me. And I'll do whatever it takes in order to be with them. So you're basically saying that you're only with Kennedy so that she doesn't take your kids from you. - Yeah. - Hmm. Her family's from Louisiana and she would take them there. - I know she would. - So where does that leave me? Skylar. Look, yo, I care for you. I really do. - Please believe-- - Is this seat taken? Uh, Kennedy. Thanks for the call, Skylar. Why don't you scoot over? - (Prime sighs) - I'm gonna let you guys talk. No no no, please stay. You have just as much a right to be here as I do. (laughs) You're looking all scared. What, you don't have anything to say? No lies, no excuses? We're all here now. Talk. (scoffs) So you're the girl from the website, huh? She's a bit younger than Autumn. How's your grandmother? Excuse me? (chuckles) Oh. Oh, you thought I didn't know about you until you called this morning? Come on, I know everything that Prime does. Everything-- from the helicopter rides to the shopping sprees to the condo on East Lake Drive. Everything. I know what you're thinking. If I know this, why don't I leave? Because I love him. He's the father of my children. And I love his ass. (chuckles, sighs) What you need to know, Miss Thing, is before you get romantically involved with a man, make sure you know everything there is to know about him. You see, arrogant, selfish, rich individuals like my fianc, they prey upon sweet innocent women... like you. I know he hurt you. Otherwise, you wouldn't have called. And I'm sorry for that. But trust me, he won't hurt you again. Now if you'll excuse us, my fianc and I have a few things to discuss. (huffs) What did I tell you the last time? I told you if you do this to me again, it's over. I can't put up with this. I won't. I've been here with you through everything, Prime. Everything. (Kennedy laughs) I'm the mother of your children. Does that mean nothing to you? I've dealt with this before and I'm not dealing with it again. I can't sit around until you figure out if you want to be what you should be. Look. Look, baby. (sighs) I'm sorry. Kennedy, I-- I don't-- No, just stop it. I'm done. I'm done. (chuckles) I am so done. You know, you want to be the $100-million playboy? So be it. Me and the kids are leaving. I'm going back to Louisiana. - You're just-- - Baby. (chuckles) Oh yeah. (ring clinks) Ice cream? You wanna go get ice cream? - All girls like ice cream. - Well, that's true. Umm, Prime. Pri-- excu-- Pri-- excuse me. Prime, you can't go back there! - My fucking life, you stupid-ass bitch! - (screaming) I should kill your fucking ass! I should kill your ass! Prime, no! Get-- Que! - Oh my God! - Prime! Prime! Let's go, man. - I'm calling the police! - (grunts) Yes, it's an emergency. - Prime Alexander attacked my cousin. - (Autumn coughing) - Come on, man. Calm down. - Get off me! Camelback and 24th. It's a boutique, Autumn de Brise. Please-- please hurry. Please. Autumn? (crying) I just know there's so much stupid drama. (Autumn sighs) I can't believe this shit. (sniffling) Fucking asshole. - (Dylan mutters) - Autumn: Oh my God. Dylan: Take a breath. Outside, come on. We need to deal with it. - (sniffling) - Okay? - Hey, thank you, guys, for coming. - You okay? - What happened? - He attacked me. - Did you press charges? - Are all of you happy now? - We're not gonna talk about-- - You got what you wanted? - Let's go. - You wanted to humiliate me? You know what? Fuck you, Prime! Fuck you! You got exactly what you deserve! And you need to be glad that I didn't press charges. I can't believe how far y'all took this shit! Uploading pictures on the Internet, calling my baby mama! And to torture me? I ain't done nothing to none of y'all! It don't make any difference. I mean, even with all this, me and my boys, we gonna still do us. Mm-hmm, you and your boys? You'll still do you, right? 'Cause you're so close, right? Best friends? - Let's go. - No no. 'Cause you're so close? Hmm, let me think. Did Dallas tell you that I've been fucking him for the last two months? - Oh shit. - Hey. - Are you kidding? - What? You've been having sex with Dallas this entire time! - Wow. - Are you serious? Dylan: This isn't about that, all right? So you eating off my sloppy seconds, I see, huh? That's how she found the fucking sex tapes. You know, all this proves is how much of a ho you are, just like you were cheating on me with Jeff Trepagnier. Seriously? She wasn't cheating on you with Jeff. She was cheating on Jeff with you, you arrogant-- - Let's go. You don't need this. - Yeah, that's right. Do the math. Do the math, Prime. I was with him when I met you. Autumn, what the fuck is wrong with you? You just gonna roll down the assembly line? Is that what you gonna do? Hmm? - What about Kalif? - Yeah, where my slice at? Yeah, you know what? Maybe I should. Then maybe I'll be just like Prime, especially since he fucked Katalina. - What? - Yeah, you thought I didn't know. - Really? - What is wrong with you? - What is wrong with-- - Yeah, why are you starting shit? Prime and Katalina? Prime and Katalina never hooked up. Really? Prime? Hey. Um, look, man, that was a long long time ago, man. Don't get worked up over that. This-- Don't get worked-- (grunts) Kalif: The fuck's he doing, man! Chill out! - Hey, Lonzo! Hey! - Chill! - Dallas: Relax! - Man, I would've told you a fucking long time ago! It was before you even knew her! - 1080 for life, huh? - Chill out, man? - Lonzo: Really? - Look. Baby, listen. - Don't "baby" me. - It was a long-- I tried to tell you! This whole thing was part of your plan, wasn't it? - This whole thing, right? - This had nothing to do with us. - Carnegie: Nothing to do with us. - It's all your sick little revenge. - Autumn: You know-- shut up! - Fuck you, Autumn! - I bet you wish you could! - Hey! Stop! Stop! That's enough! It's enough! (crying) You know what? I don't even need this shit. (piano music playing) (Autumn sobbing) Autumn, wait. I have been taken before You're not the first to rob me Of my peace And my sanity You've taken all my peace And my sanity You must've been kidding With that whole Romantic love spell Or maybe I just didn't hear you right You run over my heart And then ask for it back You must think that that's all right Well, it's not all right But you're not even human You're just above the idea of when Who I accidentally loved And gave everything to become The girl on the piano bench... - Is that her? - Singing all of her tears... What do you think? (sighs) I take it you're still not talking? Nope. What do you wanna watch? Nascar. - Lonzo: Look at you. Hm-mmm. - (laughs) No, you can ask, but that right there is perfection. - No, I mean that-- - That is the perfect hamburger. - Son? - Yeah, Mama? (people chattering) Thanks. (Katalina sighs) (sighs) Look, I-- I know you probably hate me right now, but I just wanted an opportunity to explain. Explain what? The fact that you slept with my best friend? Yeah, you know what, Katalina? I think that's pretty self-explanatory, don't you? Look, I dated Prime before I knew you-- two years ago. We just went on two dates. That was it. - You should've told me. - I tried. - You didn't want to hear-- - You should've tried-- you should've tried a little harder. (sighs) You know what? Just make sure you get something to eat. Okay? What? Really, Lonzo? Really? So, what, you want me to act like this never happened? (crying) You just expect me to let the best thing that's ever happened to me just walk right out of my life? All I can do is see him when I see you. Huh-uh. What do you want me to do? I want you to try. Don't push me away. Just try. I think what we have is worth it. I love you... with every inch of my soul. (whispers) Me too. I don't know what you want me to do to prove that, to make you see that. I'll do anything. You just tell me what you want. I don't know. It's not that easy. (sighs) Look, umm... I'm really sorry for ruining Katalina's birthday. (sighs) God, I fucking love you, you know that? Don't you ever lie to me again. - Do you hear me? - Promise. (sighs) Don't let me go.
