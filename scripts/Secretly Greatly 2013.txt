Bring this home. And don't say that you met ahjussi. Don't let your mother know. Why do I have to keep it a secret? Ahjussi appeared in an uncomfortable situation. If there's a chance, I'll meet her personally. Promise! It's a promise between men. I understand. Park Ji to Chi Woong's mom... I found him! That's the culprit! You're caught red-handed!

Nation's Intelligence Agency. Safe house of Former Minister of Armed Force, Kim Hee Kwan. North Korean refugees were wiped out one by one. Some problems occured. Who is that guy? 5446 Force. Kim Jong Il with Lee Mu Hyeok... 16 years ago.. formed a secret force. Even the highest department doesn't know. A Special Secret Force. When Kim Jong Il suddenly die.. Now, Lee Mu Hyeok leads the forces alone Everything connected to the 5446 Force... Please tell it to me. They are not normal humans. They were chosen after defeating dozens of talented soldiers. They were trained brutally, so they became furious animals. Those who don't oblige, will be idiot hostage. Is tommorow the regular meeting? Because the party ordered to end the assignment, I have to go back. Good, you can finally meet your family. But I want to ask a favor. Yes? Please.. Lend me your gun. Before I know the reason, I will not lend it. My family was caught... when trying to escape to China. Comrade, are you trying to betray the Republic? I don't want to stay more longer. A year after hearing that news, my mother died. Do you know what's agonizing me? Even though i kept their photos, I can't remember their looks. If I knew it before I would've bring more photos. Please help me! After killing some South Korea's officials, I'll commit suicide. So, my family will have a chance to live. Thank you, comrade Ryu Hwan. Captain Seo Sang Gu. Atone yourself! Dong Gu. This is an order! Before you cause some trouble. If it's like this, your family will surely have a chance to live, right? Do you think in this non-operation times, I would load the bullet ? Comrade. Now you are nothing, you are just.. a coward South Korean ahjussi Stop crying!. Rerun the assignment from the Republic, ahjussi! This is from the Barret's sniper. Team Captain Seo, your assignment is to immediatly form a 5446 investigation team. - Wait. Eat first then go. - I don't have time! I have night shift. Have dinner first before you go, I already cooked your favorite fish soup. There's no need. Hey idiot, why didn't you call me today? And that too... Don't hang the wet tissues and wash it repeatedly, so embarrasing. It's too save money, such a wase to throw it away. Ah, always. Working for the country is also useless if you don't eat first. Hei. Dong Gu! Stop. Get in and have dinner! Stupid, i already made some delicious dishes, but you don't want to eat it. - But, Dong Gu... - Huh? Do you really like to eat that much? Mom. How are you? If I could've lived with you. Maybe we could have a happy life, just like ajumma and Du Seok, right? Even if they quarrel everyday, it makes me envious. Even if I come back and acts embarrasing, please understand me. Do you know who you are pointing your gun at? If you're from the North tell me what squad are you from ? Comrade, don't think that you have no mistakes in the South. I'll give you one chance. Tell me what squad are you from? How dare you pull the trigger.. You'll die, comrade. Dong Gu. Dong Gu. Are you asleep? You have to do the deliveries earlier. So you have to wake up early. Are you asleep? I guess so. Damn. Captain Team 5 Crystal, Won Ryu Hwan, are you concerned about that South Korean women ? Why do I have to care about that women? This is about the honor of the Republic. Don't forget your purpose, Captain Comrade! Damn. Why did he go so fast? Hey, Dong Gu. What are you looking at? - Nothing. - Good to see you. Follow me! - I don't want to. - Get down! Why are you stopping? C'mon, turn around again! - Crazy bitch. She's the one whose drunk, but why am i the one acting crazy. - Don't drink anymore, you'll get sick.. Shut up! What could an idiot possibly know? Dong Gu. You must be happy. Being an idiot you don't have to worry about anything. Also you don't have to act like something happens, right? I have to go home and sleep. Right, my mood is kinda good! Let's go! Now's the time to change secrets. My name's Ran. My real name... Huh Cheom Na. Who cares about your name. Just go back home. I'm... Huh Cheom Na. When i was 18 years old, I had a baby. But I haven't seen him for 7 years. My parents sent him to the US for adoption. I miss him. Now's Dong Gu's turn. I don't know, I just know about basic tasks. My name's Bang Dong Gu. No. Won Ryu Hwan. I'm... a spy. Aigoo... There's a drunk friend. Pretending to be an idiot. and something seems to happen. What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey. Aigoo... Everyone's asleep, Why are you still playing your guitar? Hey, why should I worry about these people? Right.. This is still better than someone who pooped on the street. Whay are you still here? Do you still need something from me? No one was after you? I guess someone was sent to you? Why? Did you kill him? Nah. I just gave him a warning. That's good. That means they don't trust us. They're just afraid that the "salmon" they sent far from home will cause some trouble. Salmon? You don't know? They call us "salmon". It means those who left the country to do something big. - Sounds interisting. - You think so? Right... The risk of going against the flow and causing conflict is the same Stop this madness and go inside. I'm going back Hey, Comrade Major! Do you know? If a salmon goes back home and lay eggs in their nes, they'll die. Comrade, consciously, everyone thinks the same, right? The just need to be nice to my mother, then I don't care about facing any danger. The real problem is about the Comrade back home. Stop hiding, come out! I guess I was wrong. It's my weakness. Don't forget your purpose, Comrade Captain. He caled me captain. Squad? Age? 5446 Force, trainee 0023 Lee Hae Jin. This year 13 years old. I respect you, Captain. I respect you. You've grown up. Lee Hae Jin, substitute soldier. You're an official soldier now? What happened with the party? Damn. At least say something! Comrade Captain still remembers me. Suddenly came two people. Something's happened. Nothing happened for a year, and now this. It's strange. Dong Gu, you brat. why aren't greeting me? Your eldest brother came. You little rascal! Ah right. You haven't met. He's a transfer student. He's Dong Gu. This village's idiot. He's my brother. C'mon, transfer! Greet im first. - Hello? - Hello. What do you want? It's on me. - Dong Gu. Tell me if my sister comes. - Yeah. Ahjussi! Ahjussi! Why? - Sang Gu ahjussi? - He can't be reached since yesterday, it's ussually not like this. Lee Mu Hyeok is going against Kim Jong Un about the position that Kim Jong Il left. And Kim Hwi Gak told the people about the 5446 Force. So we're speculating that Lee Mu Hyeok gave the killing order himself. We've ordered Captain Team Seoto form the 5446 investigation unit. I think Kim Jong Un ease the relationship between the North and the South. As long as there's nothing bad going, prevent our soldiers from acting. We have to look over it more. I will work harder so this will favor us. We have to confirm the infiltration of 5446 in South Korea. - Everyones identity... - Head Team Seo. If your report is done, you may go out. I understand. Is there something you want to tell me? Did you kill comrade Seo Sang Gu? Is the comrade that important? Answer me! He wanted to commit suicide with a knife. I prevented him, becase there's an order to bring him back alive. Even if he's alive, he'll eventually be dead. What's your real mission? I came in replacement of Seo Sang Gu. From that many comrades, why does it have to be you? I'm not a kid anymore. I told you, don't! Miss Yoon, your life is hard, right? - What's the meaning of this? - I can do anything because I like you. I love you, Miss Yoon. - Don't you know... - If you're still like this... I'm going to scream. Hey... Miss Yoon. Do you want to get fired? Do you think if you're fired, you'll get another place? - Why aren't understaning? Miss Yoon... - You asshole! - Listen to me first. - Please don't be like this. Hey... Miss Yoon. You help her! I can't appear in front of them. Why do I have to help South Korean women? Don't tell me you're concerned about that lady. It's not just because she's a girl. That girl is Yoo Joon's sister. If you want to use Yoon Jun, then make him trust you. Then, it's better if I chop his head off. Don't! Just give him a warning for now Things like that is enogh to give him a burden. - No, Not that. Miss Yoon - Sister. What are you doing? Yu Jun. There's nothing. You think I don't know what's happening. - Yoo Joon. - What does this kid want? - If you mess around, I'll fire your sister! - JDon't be like this, Yoo Joon! Hei, pervert. I'll fund my sister Asshole! - You brat... - Get your hands off! Don't be like this! Don't hit other people! - C'mon, let's go! - Little prick, how dare you insult me! You beggars! I won't forgive you all. If that women is fired, will it be bad for Yoo Joon? I'll get him silently and bury him in the mountains. You have cell, right? Oke. Prepared to be photographed! Look at front! If you don't, I'll kill you! If Yoo Ran is fired, this photo will get spread. You understand, right? Now recording video. Oke, start dancing! Harder! Harder! Right! Comrade Captain I thought he was a scary person. No matter what the task is, I think this is too much. I told you, I'll do it myself. Don't! I can't stand looking Comrade Captain like this. In the end, I have to deal with that old women. Rascal. Just finish your job! Do you want a granny to do this stuff? So you mean, a kid can't do these. But you don't have shame still coming to the South. I've never eat rice. Just because of team captain I almost died. Stop playing! Please help me, Comrade Captain. Hey, stupid! You told him to rest, but you're asking me to help. Shit. What's with this guy? Pull! Fuck! Are you deaf or what? Soju and beer. Didn't I tell you, our company will supply it? Talk nicely, asshole! Do you want your ear to be hang on Namsan tower? You can supply it when your hair turns gray. I've cooperate 30 years with him, and it's enough to eat. How many times do I have to say it? Ah, fuck! Hey, brother. Why are you acting like this to a customer? Let me handle it. You can go! - Yes, Hyungnim! - You go too. Go! [Hyungnim: Kakak tertua/yang dihormati] Where? You asked me to leave? Asshole! - I hardly piled it up... - I'll kick his ass. Aigoo, What happened? - My God. Dong Gu - Aigoo. Surprised me! I'll tell my brother! My brother's a police. If your brother's a police, then my brother is the head bureau. Fuck! My God, Dong Gu. Dong Gu. Dong Gu. Compared to us, He's been here for 2 years. It's better than our help. What are you doing? Why are you punching people? - People like that desrves to be punched. - Aigoo. I don't care even if an idiot intervenes. Here, let me kick your ass. C'mon here! Don't! Don't move your fist. Do you know who I am now? What's this? Does she already know I'm allright. Don't move your fist. Don't move your fist. Aigoo.. Shit. Really? Why didn't you call me? How can you let them go? Stop it! There's no need to fight. If you're sick, go to the hospital. I'm allright. Dong Gu is more hurt for protecting me. I'm not hurt at all. You said you worked at the gas station. It's the same as holding a gun But... I knew you were coming. I've checked it out before facing that asshole. There's someone... Look at this guy's bullshit! Still an academy student but pretending to be a police. You think I don't know every police around here? I'll pass the exam this year. Don't regret it later! From now on, stop causing troubles in my store! Little prick, If you could pass the police exam, then i could pass the judge exam. Doo Seok has seen you? Help Doo Seok escape. After playing with them, burn the warehouse down. Destroy the warehouse too? You'll help me ,right? Oke. Don't kill them! Oke. Hey, asshole! Where did you get this much courage? Hey, grab him and take his money What's going on? Hey you, c'mon out! Oh. Surprising! Ouch... Stop there, asshole! Because i was afraid of blood stain, I changed my clothes. Chicken. Frog. Chicken.

They had to go to the hospital. Wow. My brother's the best. Is it cool? - Du Seok the most handsome. - How dare you call me by name. Dong Gu... If you're not really smart or genius... You won'tbe able to protect the ones you love. If you can't be like that... at least you have to be diligent. Stupid me for lecturing you. The point is, after I'm married... It's just you and mom.. Then you'll eventually be alone. Haha. Don't worry, you brat! Your brother will always be responsible to family. You just have to trust me. Understand? Bastard. Pretending to be cool.

When I was little, I was suddenly affraid to eat. When training, I was affraid that I won't stand it. Affraid to be abandoned by the party. Now. I may have become another figure. That's why I'm affraid. = ARMY Department, 5446 Secret Force Training Ground. = Almost in all administration office, everyone's talking about me. 5446 are my personal soldiers. My situation is embarrasing... Department of the Armed Forces. I shouldn't have deal with Kim Hwi Gak the last time. Our combat units do not have disabilities. Hey, the world has changed much The head comitee hopes to fix the relationship with South Korea. What do you want to order? Pull over all "salmon" back home. Ah, enough. I quit! Did we come to South Korea to clean up anchovies? I didn't ask you for help. You can do whatever you want. She gave us ginseng chicken soup, but we have to do these chores for 3 days.. absurd.. Crap. In my opinion. It has another meaning The sum of anchovies we have in total is 2119 Of course we are treated like one. We have to do this job to investigate us. Hooo... What is this kid talking about.. With your analysis abilities, tell me... How long do we have to wait? This "salmon" group will be sentenced as revolutionist traitors. After the dismissal of 5446, don't leave any notes. Destroy every documents. It's finally done... Why are you eating it? Hey, who would count the amount? It won't even be seen if I take one. Can't you ask before eating? Is this yours? Why do I have to get your permission? Don't eat my food. Where's mine? Hey. Dong Gu. Looks like there's a visitor. Hello. Oh, a suit... Do you sell a cake? Here... The kids love these. Oh, really. Thanks Ahjussi! Fighting! Fighting. Comrade General Please give them a chance so they would be known as an honor warrior of the Republic. Honor? They were ready to fight for the Republic's glory. Rather than bringing them back to be excecuted, it's better to give them a suicide order. Can you take responsibility for your words? If there's some that don't take orders... I'll excecute them all myself. Mother. You're allright, right? I've been getting along fine. I really want to see mom laugh. Cellphone. Suicide order for all 5446 soldiers. If you don't take oreder, another agent will look after and do the excecution. I'm not running because I'm affraid. I know. In our team, we're the ones left. There's only one bullet left. Let's go together. For the unification of the country! Long Live! For the unification of the country! Long Live! How can this be called an order? Reason unknown.

You still have a chance to live, you brat! You think if the Republic abandoned us, you can make us your dogs?!. You, South Koreans, are assholes! Captain, If you are born again, what do you want to be? Me? I want to be born in an usual nation. I want to be born in an usual family. Born to live, Like that. Your dream is really big. What are you saying? Then what do you want? I just want... to be born... as an usual captain. Heh, this kid... Then me! Will a pretty girl be born as my neighbour? So I can have fun with them. Captain Hae Rang. Talking about it, don't throw away your anchovies on my basket. This little rascal! Damn you! Hei, kid. After that, someone said that Dong Gu, our stupid son, is man named Won Ryu Hwan, who is feared by many. I heard it over and over again. I still don't understand. No matter if it's raining or snowing.. No matter if it's summer or winter.. Dong Gu, the idiot who always wore green clothes, Appeared. Just like that. But, behind his foolish smile, It's actually a lie. Why always ask something about Dong Gu? If he's alive or dead? But why never say anything to me? Dong Gu! Dong Gu. If you're still alive, send me a letter. Dong Gu. If you're still aive, send me a letter. Don't... Mom. Don't get sick! Mom. Don't get sick!
