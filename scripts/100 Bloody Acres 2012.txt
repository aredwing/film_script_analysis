She must have the radiator checked. But it's fine, it's not your fault. I mean, it's hot today and everything, so... You're right.

What fucking fuck have you done? We have some Freshies, Linds. You've always said that if the stars were maligned we should just go through with it. Like with the Salvo Six. Those dionaeas were already dead, fuck arse. This kind of shit requires careful planning and execution, something which you failed to accomplish on your own. God knows who might have seen you. No one saw nothing, Linds. Now, come on, you're always saying I got to be more initiative and stuff. There is a chain of command here, Reginald. Maybe you forgot who runs this joint? I'm just thinking of the business. Now, I've seen how cut up he were, fillin' up their new bling bags with the old gear. Now, we don't want to shock our number one customer. We don't do that sort of thing here at Morgan Brothers. Why do you think I keep puttin' off the delivery? What if Charlie's next crop don't turn out like the last? He will strike back to them Yates boys. That will be the end of all the good work that we did, you done. I'm sure we can work something out together. - We, uh... we.. - Yeah, we...

I thought that we had a connection. Nah, nah. A real lady doesn't want to thingo every bloke she meets. A real lady doesn't flirt with strangers. A real lady wouldn't be doin' two blokes at the same time! No, that's not true! You told me yourself! Oh, three blokes now. Jesus! Please Reg!

Sunshine so good to me Do you believe in the old saying, "Nothing ventured, nothing gained?" Ever dreamt of making a killing in the exciting world of multi-level marketing? Hi, I'm Gary Spire of Inspire Wealth Management Group. Here in Inspire we offer fully customized investment opportunities for people like you. Help! Help! The March Hare and the Mad Hatter are sitting at one side... Fuck me, Rhonda. Um, keys, keys, keys. She was so fair that she was... Morgan's Organic will get your garden growing great That's a Morgan Brothers'... I'm sorry. Hey. Fuck! James, please, don't look at me like that. We can focus on getting out of here. What do you reckon? I don't think it's fair on you for us to be having this conversation right now. All right, I can't... You really want to know? Well, I'm not proud of what happened with Wes. But it happened. And if you really want to analyze it, then... maybe, you know, there are reasons. Maybe we should be getting a few things out in the open. No, I really need you to listen to me right now, James! Shut up! You've always made such a good case, why things should be your way. But has it ever occur to you that maybe I don't want the same things as you? Short-term goals and your five-year plans. What the fuck? I'm over it! The house inspections and the winery tours and the office barbies with your project manager makes any stupid, boring girlfriend! Talking about interest rates and Clarkie's batting average and listening to John Butler because it makes you feel like you're doing something for the environment? Well, I cannot fucking stand John fucking Butler! Whip Willy Wiggins was a wee young man with a wiggle and waggle and a yes I can And he cracked his whip bull across this land From Woolloomooloo to Coonabarabran Gonna be bloody joking. Here,you know, Burkey. Alright, I can't really stop here now, heading now on. I've ... Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck... Shit and derision. G'day, Burkey. G'day, mate. What brings you out here? You know, I just come from the crash scene. You know, down Jilljara Road? - Oh yeah? - Yeah. And I'm looking for the driver. Buggers gone walk away. Haven't seen anything unusual, have you? No. No, nothing. It just went bush. That is strange. Yeah, yeah, very strange indeed. A bit like the poor old Salvo Six, eh? But I got a bit more to go on this time. I got some tire tracks from right next to the vehicle. - Speaking of which... - Yeah? Are you going to be at the fundraiser next week? Yeah. How are your pumpkins this year? They... Good, good. Giddy mate. Should get going. And right now, I want me down at that fucking fish...? Chaos I reckon. Jungle kids. Hey, I remember last year those poofters of Billy Fever found rootin' in his dam. Yeah, that's it.. very... Still, a bit of tourism can't be all bad for the district. Oh, by the way... I heard your ad on Sunshine earlier. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. What do you reckon? Bloody hilarious. Anyway, I... suppose I'd better see what those little bastards are up to, eh? What was that? What was what? Coming from your boot and... You'd better open up, mate. Know what it is? - I hit a roo earlier. - Oh, yeah? That's the, uh, twitch they make after they cark. Kind like the... the death twitch. - Hmm. - Yeah. Well, that's how it works, right? Well, we collect the roadkills for processing, the shire saves on disposal. We keep the product Aussie-made. Good on youse, I say. Yeah, just doin' our bit, Burkey. Just doin' our bit. Death twitch, hmm. I like that. Hello? Hello! Hey, ah, Linds? Now kill the engine, mate. Hey, open the trunk! What, man? Forget something? What's going on? What? No. Come on, I'm fucking freaking out in here, man! Whoa, what do you know? Open the fucking boot! - Pull the boot, Linds. - I can't. - Pull the boot! - Open the trunk! Must.. must have been... - Pull the fucking boot, Linds! - Must have been one of them poofters from the... from the festival. Pull the fucking boot! Yeah, yeah, no worries, mate. Fuck a rat! - Get off! - He want my potassium! Just relax, relax, take it easy. Alright look, I'll call for help, alright? Mate, what can I say? One of those days. Fuck it! James, I think I can actually... James! Alright, hold on, okay? Reg, James is in trouble. Got your Mr Frooty. You like pine orange? - Oh, well. - Drink up, you need it. Now, I've been doing some real deep soul seekin'. - And I reckon. - Good, that's great. - James needs help. - Hang on, I need to say this. What I reckon is, that when Lindsay gets back I'm going to have a really serious talk to him about all this. That's the smart thing to do, Reg. And I'm sorry I called you a... you know, what I called you back there. Yes, lookit, that's okay. No, no, no, what I said about you not being a real lady and everything? You are a real lady. The first real lady I ever met. What about Becs? No, she's not real. Well, she is... that's complicated. Look, I know that you tried to thingo with me because you had to. Now, you don't want to die. I get it. I don't want you to die neither. Ay, he's gonna drown! Jesus. James. Reg! Ungag him. You fucking slut! Hey, don't you talk to her like that! I'll talk to this whore any way I like! Ow. Reg! Oh. I'll take care of this. Untie us, Reg Right in front of me. Reginald! Um, I'm going to talk to him. I'll sort it all out. No, no, Reg, wait! Linds, we got to talk. True what we do. There's a - there's a reason for what I've done. What is that? You're bakin' a giant fucking pie? You don't get it, do you? This is me saying, I've had enough! No, Reg. I've had enough. See, this is what I'm talking about! You just can't treat me this way! What I ever do... is clean up after you. One fucking mess after another. Want to see the latest? Huh? It's a real ripper. Get up fuck arse. Have a look in the boot and tell us what we gonna do about this one. The next time you want to do something daft like chop up me pumpkins, piss off to your wang van and have a pull instead. Both of you, fucking die! You son of a bitch. No Linds! Linds! For God's sake, shut up! Nancy is here. There he is, Maigret. Don't worry, we'll be quick. Lindsay, you still there? Linds! Ow, ow, stop it! Just.. mate, mate, your hand. Here, use me hanky. Now, hold that tight. Keep the pressure on it. Alright, okay, thanks. I'm gonna get us out of here, alright? Just relax. Lindsay! - So, how many times? - What? You and Wes, how many times, have you fuck? For God's sake, let it go. Somewhere between five and ten? James, what difference does it make? Makes a head of difference! There's a sliding scale of infidelity here. And there's an inverse scale of forgiveableness. So if I said it was only once, that would make you feel better? Probably. It was only once, okay? You are lying. Fucking hell, it happened! What else do you need to know? I need dates, numbers. I need to know if you were sober or drunk. Who made the first move. Where it happened. What you were wearing. Fingerings, handjobs, blowjobs. I need to know the full magnitude of your betrayal! If I'm gonna... you know, move forward. Oh! Linds, you gave me a start. G'day, Nance. How are you, love? Oh... pretty, pretty flat out. - Lot on your plate? - Yeah, yeah bits and pieces. You really should wear an apron when you're working with all that yucky stuff. Next time I come, I'll make sure I give you one. Oh, you don't have to do that. Oh, don't be silly. Oh, where's Maigret? Maigret, come. You wait here. I'll go fetch him. I'll let myself in, love. Uh, yeah. Oh, no, you don't. No, you fucking dog! Arggh! Give it to me, you little fucking shit! I'll put the kettle on, shall I? Yeah, yeah. I'll be, uh... I'll be down in a tick. Lindsay! Linds! Hey, mate, there should be a tire iron - somewhere near you. - Yeah? Just over a little further down to your side there. I think... Yeah, I got it. Good work. I'm sorry I shot you, man. Oh, no, she'll be alright, eh? Yeah? I have got a, uh, big order to fill, Nance. - So I shouldn't... - I won't keep you. I just popped in to pick up a couple of those lovely pumpkins. Not the prize winners of course. Just a couple from the smaller crop. The girls and I are setting up a bake stand for the Salvo Six. Yeah, yeah, sure. Whatever you need. Reggie is doing his deliveries? Reg? Gee, uh, Reg, um... Reg is gonna be gone a while, I reckon. Really? Yeah, yeah. Uh, cousin Ruth up in Queensland. - Bloody cancer. - Oh, Linds! Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, well. Reg has gone up there to sort it all out. Could be gone a while. Driving up, I see? No, no, no, he's flying. Funny, I thought I saw him about an hour and a half ago driving down Old Cobb Road. Uh, on his way to the crown. - In the truck? - Yup, I'll pick it up tomorrow. Well, how will you get the P76 back? I'll get Burkey! Or someone to take me down there. I could always take you, love. It's all good, Nancy. It's all good. So they can stitch 'em back on, yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Bob Clay up on Jacaranda Crest he chopped his hand off, digging fence posts about ten years ago. Brave little bugger walked about 20 clicks before anyone found him. But you know what? They located his hand, they put it in a Esky, choppered him off to the city. And before you know it, he was as good as new. Yeah? Yeah, I won't lie to you. The hand didn't take too well and he had to give the farming away. But it turned out to be a bit of a blessing in disguise. He got into sign painting during his rehab, and now he has got his own business. Does all the local shops. Even did our truck. So, there is hope, eh? Yeah. Yeah, we got to find my hand, man. Right, I promise ya, as soon as we get out of here, We'll grab the others, we'll find your hand, and we'll get you straight to hospital. Right? You think I'll get to go in the chopper? I reckon that will happen for sure. Cool. You alright, Linds? You look absolutely buggered, pardon my French. No, no, no, I'm alright. Your cysts giving you gyp again? No, no, I have just been real busy, Nance. Morgan's Organic will get your garden growing great Jesus, I wish they'd stop playing this fucking ad! Lindsay, Darl, the ad's terrific. Very funny. Sorry, Nance. It's been one of those days. Of course it has. Now, you just relax. Oh, you're so tense. Did you ever see that nice fella from Guildford I was telling you about? You know, about the anger thingy? No. No, I didn't. So, I don't think the shrink's gonna do me much good now, Nance. No. I know what you need. A nice hot cuppa. Oh, that's probably, uh, Charlie Wick. - I promised I'd... - Now, stay right where you are, Lindsay Morgan. Let the machine get it. No, Maigret. You can go outside now. I mean, was he any good? Yeah, I guess he is no slouch, right? I mean, shaves his balls and everything. I mean, only the professionals shave their balls. What kind of operation you idiots are running. Jesus, Soph. ...it's about the goddamn money... Oh, God, I can see it. this time I'm calling a fucking Yates I almost wanted to come over and pick up these bags meself. Fuck! Hey, Maigret. Come on, man. Mate, what are you doing? My hand, where is it, man? Let's get the others first, eh? What did you do with it? Well, I don't know, but we got to move, come on! Well? Talk to me! All right, James. - You want details. - Yes. Come on! - Reg. - Great. Move it, mate. We gonna find it, yes? Jesus, Wesley, your hand. Fucking dog. Hey guys. What's happening? Oh, nothing much. He's about to learn the full extent of my cuckoldry. Soph, you were about to share. Thanks, Reg. Hey, you're hurt. - Wes! - Oh, no, it's nothing. Maybe you could shed some light on the situation. I wish I could talk in color. Hey, them hock grab is a bit tricky. You may want to... Jeeze, you're a natural. Excuse me, mate, can we get back to the issue at hand, please? Hey, Jimbo! I'm going to fucking kill you! Hey! Get off him! Alright, just settle. Fellows, settle! Settling now. Fucking settle! Can't you see? Right now it's not about what we did do or didn't do. But we do do. Because sometimes what you have to do is... Gee, I don't know why I keep saying "do". But, well, what I mean is... you can't undo what you've done, but you can do... Aww! Ahh! Look I'm not real good at these big speeches, but you know what I mean, right? Hey, yeah, let's gather around and listen to the psycho! - Reg ain't a psycho! - Alright? Hey, we got to get your mate into ten or he's gonna end up with a Bob Clay special. - Are you alright to drive? - Yeah. But what you gonna do? I'm going to march right in there and get them keys off Linds. And if he don't want to give 'em to me, I'm just gonna bloody make him. Hey, what about my hand, man? Aw, shut up about your bloody hand for one bloody minute! Look after your mates, eh? It's time for me to... do it. Fuck is with that guy? Oh, you are stressed, poor love. Oh yeah. If one of us had to go, it was always going to be Reg. Oh, I suppose I'll have to help family now that he's gone. How long did you say they'll be up there, Linds? Oh, hard to say with the old Jackie dancer. Reckon it will be a while, though. Who knows? He might love it up there. On the coast. May never want to come back. Anyway, it's a shame to see Reggie go. Oh, it wouldn't be the same without him around. No, no, it won't be the same at all. I know deep down you do care about him. He does look up to you, you know? You're like a father to him. Mmm, and you're the mother he never had. Anyway... Reckon I'll enjoy being by myself, huh? Yes, I'm sure we will. Oh, Darl! How about we just run for it? We get into town. Then the three of us can sit down and talk through all this shit so I can get a little bit of fucking closure! I'm waiting for the chopper, man. They gonna put me back together. It is a beautiful clean slice. Look. Oww! Oh, my God. Yo, Jimbo? There it is! - Hey, boy. - Wes. - Hey, boy. - Wes, dammit! Wes, get back here. Hey, come on. Let me call him. Oh, Linds! Oh, Linds! Yeah that's it. Oh yes, don't stop. Mmm. Oh, yes! Deep breaths, Linds, deep breaths. That's better, that's it. Just like that. Yes, oh, yes. Oh! That's it. Yes, that's my boy. That's my boy. Almost there. Almost there. Maigret, is that you? Maigret, no! Don't worry about the bloody dog! Oh, Maigret. No. Hey. - Oh. - Sorry. My hand! Fuck this, we're going. James? Sophie, come on! Come on, then. Come on! You shot him. This could be one of them like that kids from the festival. Reg, what are you doing here? Maybe I should ask you the same question. I just popped in for a few pumpkins. Is that what you call it? - Put it down, Reg - Or you what? Kill me? I thought you'd want to keep me fresh so you can hot bone me. No one's going to be hot bonin' no one. Reggie, put the cleaver down. Lindsay, give me the gun. Auntie Nance, we done some bad things this arvo. - Shut it, Reg. - Don't you tell me to shut up! From now on, you don't slap me, choke me or call me names. Auntie Nance, I want you to get on the blower Yandoit Police. You can tell them that the Morgan Brothers are turning themselves in. What the bloody hell is going on here? A druggie kid trespass on me property and I'll fuckin' shot him. Oh, why don't you tell Aunt Nance about the Salvo Six then? Oh, shut it, you fucking idiot! What do you know about the Salvo Six? One of the three terrified kids up there in the shed? I've heard just about enough of this. You're both are acting very strange, Very strange indeed. I'm gonna call the station, I'm gonna get Burkey... Aargh. Look what you've done. Arrgh, fuck! Oh, you cunt! Out! Fuck you. Sophie, I got 'em! Sophie, I got 'em! You are not going back there. That's it, we're through! Let's go! Sophie. Guys? Mum will be very disappointed in you, Reg. Been some afternoon, huh, Reggie? I know it hasn't turn out especially good for anyone, but, uh, these are the risks you take when you run a small business. Why Lindsay? It's all over. We can't get away with this. Think I don't know that? Think I can't tell that we're rooted? Now, the thing is... I am a man of my word. And when I promise Charlie Wick a ton of premium great new blend, well... I'm going to deliver on that promise. That's a Morgan Brothers guarantee All I ever wanted from you was a bit of recognition. So if your soil is off the boil You get nothin' for all your toil Our blood and bone will fix you up a treat Morgan's Organic will get your garden growing great That's a Morgan Brothers guarantee Yes, it is A Morgan Brothers guarantee that is. Well, well, well. Little Missy here... true sharpshooter. So if you thinks in me time have no problem in shooting another. Get away from him. Oh, Becs has got some competition, has she, Reggie?
