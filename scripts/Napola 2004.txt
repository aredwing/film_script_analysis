You didn't fix the washing machine properly. Juan rang too. He asked you to paint the kitchen white and that isn't white. How isn't it? White is white. That's what he says. White is white. not ivory. It's hot! Don't you sleep? Where'd you go last night? I came home. We gave Rubio's guys a real beating. Paco was going wham, wham! Like a fucking windmill. What's that? Gas for the generator. Fuck. you think there's room? What's on for today? Give me that. I have to check the TV in the bar. It's not working and there's a game tomorrow. I'll drop you at the launderette. The pipe is blocked. You want Rubio's guys to see me? His cousins run the launderette. You want them to kick my head in? You should stay out of trouble. I'll pick you up at 2:00. I wonder where Loren got to? He gets that kid pregnant, then dumps her and clears off. Loren's smart. She deserved it, the slut. -I thought you liked her. -Yeah, Iike hell I did. Why bring the ladder? You never use it. Where's Marcial? He's busy. If I'd known you were coming, I'd have brought down the TV. It isn't the tube. The valve is fine. Did you move the aerial? ...the latest information available. Three years ago... It must have been the aerial. ...and we were informed of the possibility that it would collide with our planet. A few month ago we learned that the Scott's trajectory had been altered as a result of a solar storm. The latest calculations show that this alteration means that the Earth is now directly in its path. A few minutes ago it was confirmed that the meteorite is heading for the Earth. The governments of the US, Russia... were working together in an effort to destroy it or at least modify its trajectory. Today it is my duty to inform you that all these efforts have failed. The Newton I and II space missions were also unsuccessful. Tragically, human lives have been lost. This morning, the Sky XI communications satellite crashed to Earth because meteorite particles have already penetrated our atmosphere. And this is just a sample of what awaits us in the next days. At present, the meteorite is heading towards us at a speed of 55,000 miles per hour. It is a gigantic rock 30 miles in diameter. That is, five times the size of the meteorite that extinguished the dinosaurs. We had intentionally decided not to make any announcement so as to avoid panic among the population. However, bearing in mind the present circumstances we have reconsidered that position. In the next hours we expect an initial shower of relatively small fragments of the meteorite. The final impact will occur within 72 hours and the consequences will be fatal. There is no hope of life after the impact. ...waiting for a statement from Air France. As has happened in the last few hours with three other planes, its flight 862 crashed near the Bay of Panama at noon. Again, the cause seems to have been problems in the flight system as a result of alterations in the Earth 's magnetic field. There have been over 2, 600 victims in various accidents in Beijing. ...images of the impact at 13:00 today. It is the third fragment, after those in the Baltic and in Havana, in the two hours since the announcement by the President of the Committee of Nations. ...riots in at least 26 prisons in the country. After the announcement, most of the officers abandoned their posts and prisoners took control of the buildings. There are over 300 victims among the inmates... Ale! The prisoners... They're escaping! ...the security forces... ...in what was already a dramatic situation... -Where are you going? -To Toms' house. He was to come back next weekend. He left the kids with Lara. How'll you get there? Someone will take me. Yeah. people have got nothing better to do... Take your pills with you! ...and dozens injured after incidents early this morning in jails in the north west. Police volunteers have lost all control... ...and an improvised caravan of stolen cars are fleeing desperately... Damin! -Where's everyone going? -We're heading up the mountain. We'll try to shelter in the tunnel. I don't know! Come on! Mother! Urbano! Mother! Urbano! Mother! Mother! Where are we going? To Toms' house, right? Go on, go on. It'll fall on you no matter where you go. Lara! Children! Lara! Children! Grandma! Grandma's here! -Grandma's here! -Nico! Grandma. why are you crying? Because I love you very much. And you kids? Won't you say hello to uncle Ale? I know two new songs! Hello, uncle Ale! What do you want? To give you a kiss. Scram. Where's Lara? She went shopping and didn't come back. And your parents? They're coming on Monday. on the 18:00 train. -And how are you? -We're really bored. Bored? Go into town and see the fun they're having. Hello, grandma. My kitten. Have you fixed the TV? What do you think? I only get static. We've seen nothing for two days. Don't you know? -Know what? -"What?" That... That this'll be the hottest summer in years. The swimming pools will be full. Some news. What's wrong with the phone? I couldn't get a Iine all day. It's not a good day for calling. Why? Because... it's very expensive today. The TV said so. Then why are all the lines busy? Because... people like wasting money. We can listen to this. Thank you, Clarita. Now. excuse me. I have to go to the bathroom. Heavens, love, your grandma is a disaster. I dropped the radio in the bathtub. -ls there much food? -There's no milk. Lara was going to get rolls. Uncle Ale and I will get them. Right, Ale? Right? Bye, kids. Uncle Ale and l will be right back. -Emilio! -What? Don't Iet anyone come near the house. You hear? Who'd come. grandma? -Emilio! -All right. Bye. Why did you tell them that pack of lies? It wasn't the time. It wasn't the time? When will it be? When they're dead? Just drive on. I have to get to town. Soro captured in cement factory Laguna youth helps capture him He won't come back. He was in the Martena prison. He'll have got a car. Christ! If I'd been in prison for 20 years and got out for three days, I'd go whoring. Soro is an animal. He swore he'd get back at your brother, and he will. You don't remember. You were a child. Yeah, but because of that bastard. you fucked up my life. Only Mr. Perfect got anything from it, playing the hero. Your brother saved Iots of lives. The whole town was grateful. Well, he ruined my life. The fucking hero of Laguna. You forgot about me. Yeah, because who would listen to that idiot Ale? -He never did anything worthwhile. -That's not true. You liked music and your father... Don't even mention him! Martena is far away. It'll take him a day to get here. Won't you do anything? Atienza! Atienza! Sergeant Atienza! Soro's coming back. I need help. Atienza! Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Don Miguel. I need help. -Soro is coming back. -Rosa... Ale is a man now. It's not for Ale. It's for my son Toms. Soro will go after his family. I think we've got a much bigger problem now, don't you? You should stay here and pray with us. I can't Just wait here! I have to do something. Don't you understand? No one will stop him! You. Anselmo, you saw him. When he was cornered in the cement factory, he was like a demon. You saw him! And you... You, Adela. You told me you never felt so afraid as when Soro looked at you. Do you think your family is the only one suffering? All right. Don't do it for me. Do it for my son Toms. You owe it to him! I'II go with you. Rosa. No, father. They need you more here. What the fuck...! What are you doing? You have to help me. Rubio's guys are looking for me. They're going to kill me. Go home. Ale! I knifed one of their cousins. If you don't get me out of here, I'm dead! You're dead already. Ale... -Ale! -We all are. What are you doing? What do you think? Don't mix them up, unless you want to kill Soro with salt cartridges. Where are you going? Are you getting in? The lack of fuel has made road transport impossible. Dozens of abandoned vehicles Iine the roadsides. The civilian population has ignored warnings not to travel. In an attempt to find shelter... They've drained it. I don't care what the TV says. It's all lies so they can steal. If you want anything. pay for it. ...a statement from the Chilean government, at least six fragments have crashed in the last 10 hours but to date the number of dead is unknown. Sicily and Palermo, as on other islands in southern Europe... You've improved a lot. -Where are you going? -To kick the ball. You're not to go far. Help uncle Ale with the bags. We'll stay until your parents come. Hey! See if the TV is working. Emilio! Come down! -But. Grandma... -Come down right now! Leave me alone. Ale! Don't look at me. I'm not going up there. Emilio, I'll count to three. One... All right. Two... There's a picture! Shrimp, did you take my brush? Who are you meeting? A friend, he's picking me up to go into town. -Do I know him? -He's called Josema. I don't know him. Yes. you do, his dad is Urbano, from the drugstore. I'll wait on the porch. All right. It's a patrol car! Don't stop. They must have broken down. Drive on! Drive on! Fuck! Have you finished? No. Have you finished? Can we get up? Wait till we all finish. You can take the plate. By the way, I saw ice cream in the fridge. It's for my birthday. When's that? It's in... eight days. Well, go and get it, love. It's a shame to waste it. Come on. Raquel, we left you some supper. He'll be sorry. We'll roast. No, it cools down at night. Grandma, will you play at riddles? It's very late. Come on, just one. What's brown and has four legs? A table. That's not fair! Where do I sleep? In Emilio's room. Good night, grandma. Forget it. I'll find something. You can come to my room. It was dad's. Grandma says you play the guitar. Not anymore. Why? Because I don't play. Why? Because I hate music. Why? Look at the drawing Emilio did. It's a very nice castle. It's not a castle, it's a tower. Emilio says you're afraid to go up high. you're afraid you'll fall. I'm taking the lamp, OK? OK. What are you reading? Nothing. You're reading. "How Mr. Bear found his cake". -Read it to me, please, please... -lf I do, will you go to sleep? Yes. Once there was a bear who loved eating cake... You're making it up. No! No! Will you be much longer? What? Will you be much longer? No. I'm finishing now. Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! What's up? Grandma isn't here. Where's grandma? She's gone. -Where to? -To Heaven. Why did she have the shotgun? Maybe she saw something. Or someone. Maybe she saw a wolf and went to kill it. Shut up! I can't speak to anyone. We have to go to town. We're not going anywhere. Is the wheelbarrow still in the shed? You can't put her in that. Not her. She's not "her". She's your grandmother, and my mother. What're we doing here? Your grandma wanted to be buried here. Here? In the middle of a field, like a dog? Didn't you want to be an architect? Yes. Well, dig. Raquel and I made this cross. No crosses. I picked this for grandma. We could say a prayer. Grandma... No prayers, OK? Go back home. Uncle Ale. why is there smoke in town? Nico, go home. What's he making? Goal posts. See them? See the stakes? No one is to go over the line. But, why? How can I ride my bike? Do something else. If you go over the line you'll stay in your room all summer. You hear? ...of luminescent trails repeated in the last hours in the sky over various parts of Europe and Asia. Their color and intensity is similar to the aurora borealis, an atmospheric phenomenon common at the poles. Its unusual origin is due to the alteration in the Earth 's magnetic fields and is the direct result of the solar storm that... Are you going to change rooms? I already have, Nico. Won't you read me any more stories? -Aren't you too old for stories? -No, I'm only five. Three, I've won. Hello. uncle, this is Lucio. He's a friend of dad's. Who says so? We haven't seen each other in years. Since the fiestas in Laguna. Get out of there. all of you. -My brother didn't go to fiestas. -He did with me. When is he back? What happened your forehead? I'd an accident. The car seems OK. It wasn't with the car. Lucio. right? Got any lD? Do you want to see his birth certificate? Shut up, Emilio. I haven't got a wallet. You have to leave. Why? Toms isn't here. I'll wait for him. I've got nothing better to do this weekend. Well, weekend. month's end, year's end... I told you to leave. -Uncle... -He's done nothing. I've got no gas. I wouldn't reach the main road. I'll wait here for the blackout. What does he mean? Nothing. Don't they know? Go inside. I said, go inside! I've got no more chairs. I'm thirsty. Raquel! What are you doing in the kitchen? I'm coming! Why can't we go out? Why can't we go out? -Does he never put it down? -Never. Emilio! You can't go past the sticks. It's the cement factory. If you keep moving. you don't stop. If you stop, it traps you. Cement. Come and eat! Clara! Ignore him. He's always been like that. Grandma said he nearly killed himself climbing out a window. He hates heights. He's weird. -Yeah? -He's scared he'll fall. -How old are you, Raquel? -Fifteen. Fifteen. All grown up. -Got a boyfriend? -No! -You don't? -No. Good evening. Can you move the car? It's in the way. Of course, neighbor. Raquel, set the table. What the fuck...? Where's Raquel? Where's Raquel? I'll be down now. Hurry up. Now what's wrong? You're not to go near Lucio, OK? You hear? Sleep with the windows closed and the bolts across. We haven't got bolts. Then put something against the door. I don't care what. I don't care. Anything. Closets, tables. chairs. I don't care. That man isn't your father's friend. So who is he? I don't know. I don't know. -Why are you wearing that? -I wanted you to see it. Like it? Go and take it off right now. I'll get the salad. Go and change now! Everyone go to bed. And our supper? Fuck your supper! We're going to tell dad. Look. your parents aren't coming back. What do you know? What do you know? Where are you going? Emilio! Emilio! Good evening. Sorry to bother you. I've run out of soap. Go up to your rooms. Come on. they're Just kids. Who are you? Again? Who the fuck are you? What were you looking for in the car? You're the bastard who killed those children. You're Soro. I don't go round killing kids. I'm not the one who shouts all day. Get out. Get out of my house! Why are you fooling them? Get out! Get out of here! Go away! Get in the car and go away. I don't care if you get stuck on the road. If I see you near here I swear i'll kill you. You don't remember. You were a child. Uncle Ale, they say you're mad. Where's Lucio? He left. Who's coming to town? Don't you like the slot machines anymore? If you want to come, finish your milk. We're going to the games arcade. Everyone in the truck, hurry! What? -I'm not going. -Neither am i. It'll be a relief not to see you. As you wish. For the last time, who's coming? Why are we stopping? Remember when you played with grandma? Yes. We'll play that game. Are we in town? Yes. There's no noise. No? People are bit subdued today. We'll start, OK? I can see... What can you see? It's... It's got four legs and everyone wants one when they're tired. A table. No. A bed. No. A dog. A dog? When have you sat on a dog, Clara? Can I take this off now? It's hurting me. Not yet. Take it off now. I'm going to grandma's house. You've got coins there. Play all you like. but don't leave here until I come back. Carnage in the forest Mutilated and hanged Seventh victim Caught with his last victim Soro captured in cement factory Laguna youth helps capture him Lucio. Uncle Ale? -Uncle? -Shut up. Don't move. Hello. With all that's happening, you won't care, but... I want you to know that I always... Don't move! Raquel! Are you all right? Are you all right? Calm down. I'll get you out of here. Don't worry, don't worry. It rings every hour. Don't be scared. There are no trains today! -Where's Lucio? -Behind you! I should've hanged you from a higher tree. What did they tell you? That you fell from a window? You were the last. If it hadn't been for your brother... can't he save you today? I wasn't looking for you. Raquel! It's salt! It's salt! That's all, it's only salt!
