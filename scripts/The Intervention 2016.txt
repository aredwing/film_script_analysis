Double. Oh, that's it. You know, if you're gonna have a plain black bag, you should put something on it to distinguish it from the other bags. I don't know why you needed a whole suitcase anyway. We're only there three days. Well, two days, three nights. Well, but I guess Monday is a travel day, so technically three days. Okay. Here's the thing. I am the person who overpacks her things in an unmarked, generic black suitcase, okay? It's who I always have been. It's who I always will be. That is what you're signing up for. I know. I can't wait to sign up for you. Did you have a drink on the plane? Just one. I mean... Oh, that's it. Uh, Annie. Just letting her know where we are. You know, that's a lovely blouse. This? Thanks. Your first time in Savannah? Yeah. My family has a house here from... Yeah, it's a beautiful city. I'd love to show you around. Well, you know, we're actually staying an hour out of town, so... Oh, shame. You know, if you'd rather spend the weekend with Rick, I would totally get that. 'Cause it seems that you guys really connected. Yeah, i don't know, I think maybe he was just being friendly. Lesbians! Hey. Hello. This is where the subarus are. Hi. You love that Subaru joke, huh? I love it. It's my favorite. Um, so Peter and Ruby get in in a couple of hours. Hmm-hmm. And, Matt, did you talk to Jack? Yeah, he's driving. Probably get in around the same time as us. How's he doing? Well, you know. Do we know if he's bringing her? Uh, he didn't say. He can't really bring her, right? He shouldn't. He shouldn't bring her. It's not appropriate. Fifty bucks says he brings her. You're on. Jess, why have you never brought me here? None of us have been here in what, six years? I would've come here without you. Jessie, this is your family's little summer house? It belongs to our whole family. What are you, like, a secret Kennedy or something? Seriously, I really think that we should stay together. I've been thinking about it a lot since we got here and I really feel like... Babe. Babe. I mean, what is this? This place is perfect. There are people who take care of it and get it ready for us. What, you mean like oompa-loompas? Yes. No way. I missed this place. I don't understand why we're not just getting married here. Baby! Oh! Oh, no! No! My friends! - My friends! - Hi. A check is fine, if that's all you have. Okay, this is Lola. Yes. Annie, Matt, Jessie, Sarah. This is Lola. Hello. Hi. Hi. How are you? Why not? Good to see you. Hi. How are you? Good to see you. Good to see you. You guys good? Yeah. Yeah, we're good. We just got here. It's far hotter in that car than anywhere else in the universe. Hot. Um, Jack, can we talk to you, please? We just got here. Now, right now? Jessie, can you... Sure. Sorry. I'm good without you. Over there? Okay. Yeah, there's a... What's up? Can you guys just give me a break, please? Well, excuse me, but this is a very delicate situation and I don't think having some baby stranger around is going to make Peter and Ruby feel very safe. We shouldn't even be doing this in the first place. Well, we are doing it. We all agreed. Nope. I'm gonna stop you right there. I never agreed. Okay. Well, the majority agreed, and we are doing it. This marriage intervention is long overdue. Oh, my god. That sounds even more insane when you say it out loud. "Marriage intervention"? Yeah, it doesn't sound great. So, Lola, where do you live? Um... Nowhere. I kind of just travel around with Jack. We met at south by southwest at my boyfriend's show. We just, like, saw each other and were like... Just, like, hit it off really well. That's cool. So, Jessie's your girlfriend. Exactly. Yeah. Right. Okay. How long have you guys been together? Three years. Oh. Three years. Nice. Where do you guys live? We live in Los Angeles. But, you know, not together. We don't live together. Oh, okay. Why not? Uh, she's very independent. Right, right, right. Hmm. Do you want me to just tell her right now to go home? No. Yeah. That's extreme. Okay, fine, no. feel bad for bringing her along. Jack, I... Did you guys ever think for one second what it would feel like for me to come back here? She's kind, she loves me, and she makes me feel good. And fuck, i really need to feel good right now. So please, be nice. Okay? Tell them, "no fucking way." No, you're not getting on the plane until they make good on the terms of the contract. Have faith in yourself. You're a genius. I'm gonna leave it at that. All right. When I hear from them, I'm gonna text or e-mail. All right, good. Sorry. I love sitting on the side of the road for 30 minutes, 'cause it just gives my ass a chance to sleep. Okay. I said I'm sorry. Okay? We're going into a dead zone, and it's an important call. Obviously, I couldn't risk getting dropped. Just because other people's priorities are different than yours doesn't mean they're not important. Okay, you know what? Let's just drop this. Gladly. I think we should do it tonight. Tonight? That way they have the weekend to process while they're amongst friends. Yeah, or it could mess up the whole weekend. Well, I'm pretty sure this whole weekend's been fucked before it began, right? Why are you even here? But since you insisted on doing this, i wanted to be here. Peter has been your best friend for 20 years and Ruby is Jessie's sister and my mentee. She's your mentee? She's always looked up to me. I think we should do it tonight after dinner. Okay, I haven't seen him in a long time, but there's no way they could be that bad. I've been looking forward to this all week long. Let's just pretend to have a good time, okay? Oh, you mean like i do at home? Well, if I'm being brutally honest, Okay, let's move past it. We're done. Can we do that? It's done. Okay? Hi. Hey! Sorry, we would've been here earlier, Ruby, what happened to your leg? Need any help with your bags? Oh, it's broken, but it's fine. Yeah. Hi. Hi. I can't believe you broke your leg. Did you start coloring your hair? No. Hi. Hi. How are you? Good to see you. I'm good, but, oh, my god... I'm Lola. - Nice to see you. - The house is amazing. Have you checked on the kids yet? We just got here, Peter, so no. All right, can we? 'Cause we haven't called since we landed. Ah, so, just so everyone knows, there are delicious drinks being served just out in back on the porch, so... Wanna come have a drink? Uh, I think we should settle in first before we... Peter, is there anything else you wanna micromanage? I'm fine. I am... all right. I'd just like to have one drink. Everybody's grumpy after travel. It's not a big deal. No. Jack, you need to take off your blinders, okay? Just look at the situation. Yeah, we're gonna do this. No, I'm not saying that i don't think we should do it at all. I'm just saying that with the leg development, that maybe this is not the best weekend. When else are we all gonna be together? I mean, we have to do it. Look, you have to admit, even after five minutes, you can feel it. The oppression, just the weight, the burden of their marital prison. I mean, it's terrifying. Yeah, I know, but it's like... You know the kind of person who likes having the mirror held up to them so they can better see the ways in which they need to improve? Mmm-hmm. Ruby is the opposite of that person. Mmm-hmm. I don't know. I feel very scared. We can't think about ourselves right now. We have to save them. You can't tell Jessie I'm smoking. We quit together. Like I give a shit. Today is mine and Peter's anniversary, so... Congratulations. How many years? A lot. A lot of years. Should we do something tonight to celebrate? Um, well, no, 'cause that would mean we would have to acknowledge it, and we haven't acknowledged shit, so... If we acknowledge the anniversary, we haven't had sex in six months, and... Right. What's up with this? Oh, yeah, i do this again. Don't give me that look. It's fine. It's totally under control. Okay. Not... Fine. When did you start smoking again? I didn't. And they really hit it off. She went like this, "we really hit it off." You know what I mean? Not my type. Yeah, but she's Jessie's type. Ah, come on, please. What is she, like, 12? Well, she's early-20s. That's Jessie's type. I want to... I want to... kiss me. Did you see it coming? Is that connected back... So, Pete, um, do you still lease? Huh? Your car? Yeah. Cute. Oh, my... Go like this. What about 'em? What? It's like a little puppy. You still have that, um, BMW? Let me do it to you. I wanna put your entire nose in my mouth. I wanna suck everything out of your nose. Hey! Hello. What? You guys mind taking this inside or into traffic? Okay. I'm gonna go shower. No. You hang out with your friends. No! - Sorry, Lola, it's not you. - Don't be sorry. I just haven't seen this guy in a long time. I'll be back. Give me that. No. I'll be back. I'll miss you. I'll miss you more. That is just puppy love. What, do you forget what it looks like? She doesn't make you feel, like, super-old? Her? Like, so old. She doesn't... No. Stop. First of all, "so old"? No. We talk about... Was Titanic out yet? No. But I've explained it to her, and she knows how it ends. - Made a cheese plate. - Ooh! - That looks yummy. - So... So there's... Where is it? There's Sadie. Oh! Oh, my gosh! In her little dress. Annie, look at this one. Oh, cute. Oh, my god. Will you send that one to me? How could you ever have a bad day when you get to look at that face! You gotta send me that one. What is that, like, a little lion costume? What're you guys all looking at? Looking at Pete and Ruby's kids. - Oh, can I see? - Yeah, look. He's a cute kid. I can't believe how big they are. So cute. Well, you see them so infrequently. You know, when you're around them all the time, they don't really change that much. How old is that? Yeah, she has... Well, Leo is eight, Sadie's six, and Stanley's two and a half. He's almost three. In six months. In like half a year. October's in three months. Sadie is in October. Stanley is in January, so, six months. He's gonna be three. Oh. How 'bout you guys? When are you gonna have babies? I don't know. Well, we have... We have to get through the wedding first. Right. So, first things first. But that's on our list. Yeah. Of course. But you gotta... You know, like, you don't wanna wait too long, right, because they say, like, after you pass 35, it's harder to get pregnant. I've heard that. Yeah. Ruby. Ruby. The eggs aren't... Trust me, take your time. No, I'm just... They're a handful. Thank you. Hmm. So, Annie is drinking again. Well, she just has a glass or two, um, you know, some nights. Um... But it's nothing like before. Um... Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Hey, uh, we haven't got your "save the date" card yet. We have to... We gotta save that date. Yeah. It's just... We haven't exactly decided on what it's gonna look like. Mmm-hmm. So we... There's a little bit more decision-making. Yeah, but the wedding is in three months, so shouldn't you get those in the mail? I was gonna ask you, what happened? It was a softball game and I was walking down the stairs, and I had Stanley and a bunch of, you know, snacks and water bottles, and I just missed a step and I end up cracking my knee on the stairs and... Oh, my god. Yeah, so, six to eight weeks on crutches. Ruby, that's horrible. Yeah. It's my idea of a good time. It's a long time. Hi. Hi. Hey. I'm talking about, we went to Paris and Rome and it was amazing. But after like a month, i thought to myself, "you know what country i really wanna see? We've lived in America our entire lives, right, the entire time? Have you once driven cross-country? No. That's a crime. It's fucking amazing! You're getting so upset. I said, "let's get a car," and she said, "okay." So, we got that truck. And the best part is, i get to choose where we go. We can literally say, "okay, now we wanna go north," and just... We'll just fuckin' go north. Does it need to be... You want some? Here, have some. Oh, yeah. I'll show you how. You gotta come home though, at some point. Nah, I can't be in L.A. It looks like it's something... look. Yeah. Cheers. Cheers. Am I right? No! ...about the serial killer. Right. I think that, like, very few people set out to intentionally do something that they know is wrong. You know, when you look at history... Great. Oh, my... I'm not pro-Hitler. Is that where this is going? I'm just... I'm using him to make a point. I don't know if we need to... No, go on. Go on, make your Hitler point. Okay, uh... Hitler was, um, doing what he thought was the right thing. He truly believed it. And he thought that he was doing good. So does that mean that he is bad? Yes. Yes, it does. Yeah, he's Hitler. He's Hitler, of course, yes, but what... But what he did was bad, but he didn't mean to be bad. He was trying to... He was probably the most evil man in the world, and you're trying to form an argument... Well, I'm sorry, i don't understand being a Nazi sympathizer. I'm not a Nazi sympathizer. I am just trying to... Stop! Stop being so handsome in schindler's list, Ralph fiennes. Because it makes knowing who to root for too confusing. You know, when you... "Ralph" fiennes, she means. Rafe? "Rafe," yeah. I know. I don't know who told you that. At least I'm not a racist. The Harvard racism test says that you are racist. Oh, come on. That is a bullshit test. Very racist. It's not a bullshit test. "How do you like them apples?" It was Matt Damon's line from good will hunting, which was the movie where he went to Harvard. Take a deep breath and stop doing that. Peter, did you cook the chicken? I did. It's really salty. You guys, I'm very sorry. For Christ's sake, i used a dash of salt. You over-salted. It's like your calling card. Well, maybe you just have an overly-sensitive palate. Maybe you're heavy-handed. I was doing what i thought was right, like your good friend Hitler. I had an abnormal pap smear. Oh, no. Well, they said that, um, a lot of people have it. It's hpv. Oh. And you know what the doctor said to me? That it's actually not really anything to worry too much about and just to keep an eye on it. So, that made me feel better. I think you should just come out with it, you know? Just get straight to the point. No, no, we have to ease into this. No. I think that Sarah's right. Jessie, you should just look at them, and you just say, "Peter, Ruby, fucking get divorced." That's not exactly what I meant. Why do i have to say it? Because she's your sister. Yeah, but this is your plan. Why don't you say it? Look, why don't you guys just both do it? You mean, like, play off each other? Yeah. Oh, yeah, I see what you're saying. I like it. Let's do this. All right. Okay. Treats for the... Some treats. Some drinks. There you go. There you go, guys. - Super strong. - Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers! Cheers! Drink. Everybody take a drink and sip. - Cheers. - So... Right. Yes. Here's... Yeah. We think it's time to just get something out. Just get it out in the open. Jessie. Yeah, um. Yeah, because, uh, it's... Um... We talked and... Okay, just... Should I? Yeah. Ruby. And Peter. We think that it's for the best for both of you, probably for everyone, if... If we play charades tonight. I know that apples to apples was discussed, but I don't like that game. I'll play charades. Sure. It's a big announcement. Thank you very much. I love charades. It'll be fun. Cool. What was that? Well, I panicked. And you weren't much help. I was warming up. Well, I got too warm. And I think I might be a little bit drunk. And sometimes Ruby scares me so much and I just freaked out. Okay. Calm down, calm down, it's fine. Here, give me these. We can do it tomorrow and when you're not so full. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Annie? Hmm? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Hmm. No. Just gonna... No, no. Let's not, honey. She is super full. I am going to take... Can I help? Thanks, no. You were too tasty, dinner! Right! I'll see you guys downstairs, okay? Matt, we're... No! He is nice. See you downstairs. Hey. In case you need to throw up more. Do you think anyone noticed that I was drunk? I think they may have had some idea, yeah. Shit. Can I have a hug? Do y'know? Something that's always just really hurt my feelings is you never tried to make out with me. Not even one time. Sorry. Fine. I love you. Hey. You know, I've been with women before. Jack's cool with it. Cool. We should get down there. Sure. Mmm-hmm. Charades. I mean, i just don't think that she should be drinking. You should stay out of it. It's... she's an adult. Well, Matt, what do you think? I mean, you're with her every day. Well, I think it's just an isolated thing, and I wouldn't worry about it. I mean, she has like a glass of wine and then before you know it, she's like five Martinis in and she's getting tackled by the secret service for trying to kiss Bill Clinton at a restaurant. I just... I think that maybe we should sit her down tomorrow. No, no. No, no, no. Well, she shouldn't drink ever, like at all. She shouldn't... Just stay out of it. It is none of your business. I am. I'm concerned about her. that people should deal with their own personal problems, on their own time, in their own way, and other people should kind of butt out, right? That's exactly what I'm saying. Very interesting. Yes. Yes. Okay, fine. I'll drop it. But listen, if I see her drinking again, I want us to say something. Okay? What is it? Is it a TV show? Is it a movie? Give me... Give me a "sounds like." What does it sound like? Taking... Time! - Ah! - What was it? Uh, m-a-s-h? I don't know what that is! Oh, that. It was a television show. What are those periods behind it? It's a movie, too. It's a movie. From when? A long time ago. Who cares? All right, you guys, you guys... Ruby! Ready? Yes. Okay, okay, okay. Movie. One word. Movie. Psycho. Big picture. Jaws! Yes. Yep. Yes! Okay, okay, okay. Good. Film. Second word. Hump. Forrest Gump! Two words. First word. The... Burned. The burned... the... No, you can't do that. Hot... the hot... - The untouchables! - Peter! What? How is that... That's insane. A monster? The bear. The unbearable lightness of being! No way! No way! Time's up! Time's up! No, no! You were so good. How many did you get? This is the team to be on. Good. That was very impressive. Hey! Hey, could you scoot over a little? Annie, could you scoot over a little? Oh, baby. Hmm? Look, I can do this. Oh, my god. You don't think it's weird we don't live together? I don't think it's weird or not weird. I think it just is what it is. Mmm-hmm. You know, it's been three years. You don't think it's weird at all? Really? I don't wanna talk about this right now. Okay? Well, you never wanna talk about it. Do you want me to fuck you or not? Yes. You okay? Yeah, sorry. It's okay. You think... Is this okay? Yeah. Can I ask a question? Yeah. Okay. Ruby said uh, Lola's your type. Your type's younger people? That's what that means, right? You are my type. Okay? So how young are we talking? Good night. Jessie. I can't have a conversation with you? Look, I still want you to fuck me. What are you doing? Where's Sarah? She's upstairs. No, no, no! Jessie, it's okay. I know you want to. Nobody has to know. See? That wasn't so bad. Morning. Hey. Beautiful morning. It is. How is everything? Everything's fine. I'm fine. Good. And you? How are you doing? Great. You know, I really do want to see you guys more. How are you and Sarah doing? We're doing good. Can't believe you haven't fucked it up yet. I know, I must be slipping. Are you bored? A little. God, I miss having the time to feel bored. Do you have one? No, I'll take one, though. Morning. Morning. Thank you. You're welcome. Morning. Morning. Good morning! Who is ready for some kickball? Oh, mimosas. Yes. Can we just... There was something i wanted to get out of... What? The... your... Somebody's in a mood. No drinking. Ruby wants to sit you down because of last night. That is absurd. Matt said that it was an isolated incident and that you were fine. Okay. So what's the problem? The problem is, you are one mimosa away from getting this whole thing turned around on you. If you wanna do the intervention with them, you can't drink, okay? You have to keep it together. Do you think i can't not drink? I don't really know. Can you not drink? The wording is so confusing. Okay, simple. No drinking. Okay? Fine. Fine. It's better anyway. Yeah. I gotta keep my eyes on the prize. Um... Game time is in 10 minutes. Ten minutes! So, yes, be ready. And Matt and Jessie, can you please help me move this, uh, bucket? Sure. To the outside. I guess take that side and... perfect. And then we're gonna... Oh, I gotta lift it. Here. Ooh. I had an epiphany. I know how to do it, but we need to figure out a way to get Peter and Ruby to leave for a little while, so I can fill everyone in. So, how are we gonna do that? That wasn't part of your epiphany? No, it's not helpful. Okay? Well, we tell them we need them to go get something in town. That's good. That's really good. Okay, what? Uh, something for the barbecue? Okay. Corn? Hey, would you two mind, after the game, going into town to get some corn, corn on the cob, for tonight? Sure. Great. Oh, shit, babe. Would you go to the kitchen and grab my sunblock? Yeah. Thanks. You and I are very similar, Jessie. Yeah? Mmm-hmm. We're both sexual beings. I mean, i have had sex, but I... But it just makes it hard because we're never satisfied with just one man or one woman. I don't really understand what's happening right now... Just one kiss. Just one. Just to see what it feels like. No, you'd probably be very disappointed... Jesus Christ. What the fuck was that? It was nothing. Let's go play. that you won't just move over to third base, so... I'm just gonna be here on first base. I'm not gonna be running or anything. How are you gonna catch the ball when you can't... All right, let's go! Let's go! How we feeling? Jack. Pass it to me. You can do it, Taylor! Get it! Oh, shit! Look out! It's been a while since I had any balls flying at my face, so... Matt! Mattie! Mattie! Here. Here, here, here! Why didn't you just throw it to me? It's gonna happen all day. How do you want me to throw it to you? We're fine. This is sports. This is what sports is. but I was mvp on the kickball team at my detention center, so... Should not brag about that. All right, all right, all right! Here, here, here! Right here, right here, right here! Right here. Right... I caught it any... Will you pass me the ball, Peter? You want me to pass you the ball? I'll pass you the ball. Okay. Ready to rumble. Oh, my god, Ruby. Are you okay? Come on, let's go back to the house and get some ice on it. You all right? Sorry. God, Peter. It's okay. We're just gonna get some ice on it. Should have a time-out. I'm sorry. It might be tricky to get them to go on that errand now. Does it hurt? No, it just startled me, more than anything. So... Yeah. So, um, I was wondering when you were planning on going into town, just because, you know, I wanna know that we are gonna have enough time to prepare all of that corn. Yeah. I'll go in a few minutes. You both have to go. Yeah. Well, I don't think Ruby's gonna wanna go with me anywhere right now. Peter, listen. Life is hard. Making your way in the world today... Takes everything you got. Yup. Peter, listen. Take her out, get her some ice cream, tell her you're sorry. 'Cause we all know it was an accident, clearly. But still, it was embarrassing for her, and she could probably use some time-out. You know? Thanks. Hmm. Hey. You ready to go to the store? I don't really feel like going to the store right now. All right. Um... I'm just gonna be outside if you need anything. Hey. I'm sorry. Will you please come to the store with me? So, corn? Just corn? Thank you. Corn for eight. Okay. Strategy meeting inside, now. I really am sorry. Just stop apologizing. Because you forgive me? Just stop apologizing. On a&e's Emmy award-winning show, intervention, they tell them that they're gonna be part of a documentary... Okay, okay, okay. We know how the show works. The point is, I think that we should all write something saying why we think they should break up, and as their closest friends saying that we want them to stop doing something No, no. No, we're not doing that. What do you mean, "no"? I actually don't think this is a terrible idea. No, you guys heard Peter last night. This will not go over well. I think that it will go over just fine. How would you know? You were passed out during the whole conversation. - Okay, Jack? - Yeah? You have now spent 24 hours with them. Can you honestly say that you feel happy about them being together? but I'm not gonna tell Peter what he should be doing. Are you... You think that Ruby is the problem? I'm not saying Ruby... Peter is about as warm as a Russian gymnastics coach? Guys, if we're going to do this, we need a plan that doesn't end in charades. Oh, charades was so much fun. I think the letter plan is really good. Let's do the letter thing. Yeah, I'm with Jessie. I think it's a good plan. That's a great idea. is we should all start thinking about what to write, then we should write something. Lola, you should put on, like, a whole shirt. Oh, okay. Okay. Great. You gonna open the car? I wanna take a walk. We should get back. Five minutes. It's just incredible. I just love that sound. Mmm-hmm. It's been years. It's our bench. Come on. Sit with me. No, Peter, what are you doing? Tell me the story. You used to love telling me the story. This is ridiculous. It's professional. Okay, great, great, great. This is all wonderful. Oh! No, no, no. Actually, actually... No, I don't know if we should have alcohol. Okay, one glass of wine. Just one glass of wine. Annie. That was a mistake. That was a mistake. - I'm just sweating so much. - Take a breath. Calm down. It's gonna be okay. They're here! What? Okay. Okay. Thank you, Matt. You did a great job. Okay, Jessie, take your position. Where is... okay. Okay. Next to me. Up. And... next to me. Your position is next to me. Yup. Here we go. What's this? Would you guys please take a seat? What's... We got the corn. Thank you. Ruby. Ruby, Peter... Um... Before we all got here, we talked. We... Um... The people in this room who are not you two. Not Lola, because she's new, but just the five of us. Part of the reason that we wanted to come here was to talk with you. Um, because we... We, uh, wanted to bring something up. It might come like... It might sound weird... But maybe it would be good. And it really could be good. Okay, what could be good? - Uh, so bad. - It's okay. Um... Scientists believe that, um... As... As man began to walk on two legs, the burden on the mother was increased. Uh, because they were no longer able to just carry their young on their back and go on with their daily lives. You know, they needed help. Thus the need for a partner, a husband, if you will, arose. I'm sorry, what are you talking about? What do you think? Maybe you should... Just read the letter. Just gonna read the letter. "Ruby, I've known you for my whole life. "You are like my sister. "Peter, you are like the brother i never had. "But not like the brother I have because he and I are not close. "I love you both very much. "And, as your friend, i can't stand by "and watch you suffer without saying..." Okay, what is happening? What's happening? "I remember a time..." They think you should get divorced. What? They think that you two should get divorced. We just feel like you guys are unhappy. Hold on. So... so let me get this straight. You all got together and talked about our marriage. No. No. We didn't get together. It was phone calls and texts and... Well, our marriage is none of your business. Man, we're just trying to help you. Both of you. - You wanna help? - Yeah. Annie's, Annie's, postponed your wedding four times? Did you ever give that one some thought? Like any of you are fuckin' perfect. All right, Peter, come on, man. And you? You're running all over the fuckin' planet with a goddamn art student, afraid of something you're not even man enough to face. Peter, I think that maybe if you just calm down and listen... "Calm down"? And you. The fact that you, of all people, think you have any business giving anyone relationship advice Sarah's the first person you've been with who could rent a car. Peter, you gotta calm the fuck down. I need to calm down? Yes, you have to calm the fuck down! "Calm the fuck down"? Calm the fuck down, yes! Would you still defend her if you knew i walked in on her making out with Lola earlier? And you wanna talk about our marriage? That is not true. Can you fucking believe this? Ruby. I'm alone in this? Fuck this. It... Babe. It... Ruby... Don't. This is kind of worst-case scenario right now, huh? He made some interesting points. I'm gonna tell you what happened. Babe, will you please stop? What? She kissed me, okay? Peter said that you were making out. No! She kissed me. Peter walked in. It stopped. So Peter walking in is actually why it stopped? No. No. Peter walking in was basically instantaneous. I would have stopped her. I guess we'll just never know, huh? Are you upset? No. Kind of. It's a little bit weird. Yeah. We always said we would... We just wanted to have fun together, right? Until it stopped being fun? Nothing too heavy, nothing too serious. Could be somethin' serious. I'm 22. Right. Right. Do you wanna come out and have a drink? Can I do anything? You can get your hand off me before I break your fuckin' wrist. I'll come back. Okay, stop, dude. It's not... that's fine. Oh! God. If you could watch a video of what happened, you would not be this upset! Did you wanna kiss her? The whole thing caught me completely off-guard. You know I have terrible reflexes. Did you want to kiss her? Did I wanna kiss her? No. But did it feel fun and exciting and dangerous to get that kind of attention from some cute, young girl, and did I like that? Yes. I really can't believe this, Jess. Okay, so when the fucking rental car guy is flirting with you, batting his eyelashes at you, there is zero part of you that likes it? There's no part of you that gets just like a little bit excited? No, Jess. No. Okay? Because I'm in love with you. So I don't care. Well, aren't you fuckin' perfect, then. Yeah, you're just sittin' up there on your high horse, so much better than everybody else. You never have an impure thought or feeling. Just fuckin' saints... I miss sleeping with men. Excuse me? Yeah, I do. I do. I miss it. I think about it when you're fucking me with a strap-on, like, every time. And you know how I always say, like, "i can't tell the difference"? Well, I can. It's not as good. Jess! Maybe I should go and try to talk to Ruby again. Just leave her alone. Should we try to find him? It's gonna be dark soon. No. Let him cool off. If he's not back after dinner, we'll go look for him, all right? This is all my fault. Except for the Jessie-Sarah thing. Lola, that's kind of on you. I'm taking a shower. I'm gonna take a shower! Over my dead body! Get out! Get out! I'm taking a shower! I'm in here. Excuse me, I'm in here right now. I am also in here now! Can you not see that this is crazy? Don't call me crazy! These are my feelings. What do you want? Do you wanna go kiss Jack? Would that make you feel better? I was being facetious! Guess we're even. You swallowed his whole face. I liked it. Am I having a stroke? Should we do something? What do you mean, like kiss? No. Are you done? Hey. No. There's really... No, no, no. No, no, no. Stop this! Stop! That is enough! That is enough! You are both acting like animals. You are better than this. No, one of us is. Oh, cut the shit! Lola? Jessie? Do the two of you want to run off together? I didn't do anything... Can you just answer my question? No. No. No. No. do you wanna break up with Jessie about this nonsense? No. Jessie, whatever you did or did not do, you did or did not do enough to allow Lola's face to get close enough to your face to even make this a conversation at all. Lola, take this as a lesson. No one likes a Jolene. Sarah, I understand that you are upset. I would not be thrilled about this either. But Jessie loves you. She's a good person. And you know that. We are all under a lot of stress, so let's just sit down, drink some of that incredible chardonnay and calm the fuck down. Okay? We should probably go look for Pete. Matt... all right. Sorry. We should split up, okay? Okay. If you find him, call. Split up? Yes. All right. See you, guys. I'm gonna go this way. Okay, I'll go this way. Well, Jessie, you probably don't wanna go alone. 'Cause of the dark. I'll be fine. But you probably would be more comfortable if i came with you. Right? Would you be more comfortable? I mean, if that's what you need. Let's go. Hey. Do you want any help? Sure. She didn't kiss me back. I know it doesn't make it any better, but I'm sorry. It's okay. Am I the first girl Jack's dated since him and his wife got divorced? They didn't get divorced. Mary died a year and a half ago. But, yes, you're the first person that he's dated since. Hmm. I'll come out if you promise not to talk about it. I promise to not talk about anything you want. Petey. Peter! I should've probably tried to stop this whole thing. I really don't think you could have. No, I guess not. Once the Annie-train starts rollin' along, it's kind of hard to stop. I already started today, so... Who's that? You know, two weeks before we found out Mary was sick, she told me she wanted a divorce. And we met with a lawyer, we started the whole process. I knew she wanted me to fight it. Thought it'd be easier just for us to go our separate ways. And then the second we found out she was sick, everything changed. In an instant, all that resentment and all that venom and anger we had toward each other, it just disappeared. Right, and there we were... The same two people who fell in love 10 years earlier. It was so crushing to watch her go through that, but, you know, it was the best year of our marriage. And then, she was gone. You know, it took something devastating for me to figure out what I had right in front of me. Well, are you gonna do like a buffet style or a table service, because... Yeah, but then everybody can just pick what they want, you know, and the food doesn't get as cold. What about kids? Are there kids invited? Yeah. I mean, I guess it depends how many people, right? Right. How many people are you thinking? I'm not sure. You found the dress yet? There are versions of it, yeah. What about the cake? What are you doing about the cake? We don't really know. Well, you have to order it in, like, months in advance. I'm really good with any of this stuff if you need help, Annie. It's just, you know, Matt is doing everything, so he's been like a godsend. Have you picked your song? Your wedding song? Speaking of Matt, um, where are they? Because it's... Oh. Whew. Speak of the devils. Hi, guys. I'm sorry. Would you guys mind? No. No. Yeah. You agree with them? I won't let it get messy. I'm sorry i don't have a penis. I'm sorry I'm so old. You know, as long as we're hangin' out, havin' fun, I don't have to kiss anybody else. Hey. Wake up. Hmm. I made blueberry pancakes. Come on. Come on. Morning. There's some fresh coffee and a spread of whatever you like. What do you think is happening here? I think he's lost it. What are you guys waiting for? - Come on, eat. - Hi. Morning. Hey. Eat, please. What smells so good? Hi. I also made muffins. They should be done... Uh, from scratch? ...in about two minutes. Yes. Peter, are you okay? Yeah. There she is. Yeah. Good morning. Okay, now that everyone is here, I would like to fill you in on today's schedule. I was thinking last night, I realized that every time we come here, we go out on the boat. It's pretty much the best part of the trip. And we haven't been on the boat yet. Hmm? So everyone eat, get dressed, and in one hour we will depart. A day on the water. Everybody in? Yeah. Yeah. I love boats. Excellent. I'm gonna finish making lunch. Everybody eat. And the muffins are coming right up. Five minutes! I feel concerned. - He's fine. - Hey! Fine-adjacent. Listen, do me a favor. Google "how to tell if someone's having a psychotic break." Annie. Woo! You guys not hear the bell? Yeah. Rally the troop! Let's go! Come on. Come on. Come on. We're gonna... Listen. I think he is... No, he's not. What's going on? You guys not hear me? Let's get goin'. Yeah. For the record, this is turning off and it's staying here. Hi! Why aren't you dressed? I'm not going, Peter. What? No. Come on. We're all gonna get going. We'll wait for you. I'm not going. Ruby, you have to come. It's a tradition. You can't just change tradition. You can't just walk away. Look, hey, Ruby. You spend years building these things, right, and they mean something. You can't just walk away without even... Jesus fucking Christ, Peter, just stop! Stop what? Stop it, all of this, all of this fucking bullshit! The fucking boats, the sandwiches! Just stop it! I was just trying to do something nice. It's too late. It's just way too fucking late. Okay? It's not too late. You need to just let go! So, that's it, you made up your mind, you're just gonna walk away... You'll leave it all behind, right, the family, everybody? You gave up years ago. And you didn't? Look, I'm not saying that I'm innocent here. We've been hurting each other for years. But just think about it, Peter. When was the last time you even remember feeling in love with me? Last night. Last night? Yeah. Okay, and before then? I don't... please. Exactly. There's nothing here, Peter. There's nothing. That's not true! That can't be true. Come on, Ruby. I'm done. I can't. There are some things that are worth fighting for, and I'm asking you if you will fight for it with me. I need you to go, okay? I need you to leave. Come on. Please. Come on, Ruby. Please! I need you to leave. Just fucking leave, okay? Just get the fuck outta here! Don't fucking touch me, Jessie. Go away. Get the fuck out! Get out! Get out! Get outta here! Now what? Don't you think we should go check on her? No. No. I think I'm gonna go up there. Annie, don't. See what's happening. I was just coming to see if, you know, if there was any... She threw peaches at me. Peaches. So, I think one of you should try. Actually, no. No, thanks. Guys... What? I could go talk to her. Lola, no, no, no. Why? Yes. Yes. Actually, I think that would be perfect. 'Cause Ruby would never throw peaches at someone she doesn't know. You shouldn't get in the middle of this. It's okay. I can do it. Guard your face. Is it cool if I sit down? So, do you wanna break up with your husband? Why would I talk to you? I don't know. It's been so bad for so long. I just let go of the idea that we'd ever be good again. It will be easier just to end it, but I... But I don't want to. And I'm so mad at myself that I don't, but I... But I don't. So, don't. But what if we try and it doesn't work? Well, maybe you'd regret not trying more. What if we can't get back to where we were? Well, maybe you could make something new. Hi, you've reached Peter's cell. Leave a message after... We'd just finished lunch. We were supposed to go back to the house because my dad was going to take you fishing. And you asked me to go for a walk. You seemed so nervous. I thought it was because you were scared to be alone with my dad, but... I wanted to be alone with you for just a few more minutes. So, we went for a walk and we came here. I remember thinking, "i never thought i could be so in love." And then you got on your knee and took out the ring and asked me to marry you. I started crying and I couldn't speak, i was crying so much. And I just nodded, and I nodded, and I jumped in your arms. And we just... We sat on this bench laughing and crying and holding each other for hours. It was the happiest day of my life. All of my happiest days have been with you. I still love you, but I... But I'm not happy. And I know that you're not either. And I'm so sorry. I'm... And I don't know, Peter, I don't know if we can... If we can fix it. But I wanna try. Will you try with me? Nothing. Why won't they just call or text or tweet or something? Yeah, I mean it's really rude they're not considering you in all this. Guys, I'm so sorry. I think that... You don't have to apologize, okay? You guys were right. Oh, god. You poor things. How are you gonna tell the kids? Well, we're not. You'll just move out in the night? No. Nobody's moving out. We're... we are gonna work things out. Oh, yay! You're staying together? Yeah. No. No. No. No, no, no, you weren't supposed to stay together. You were supposed to get divorced. Yeah, but we don't want to. You're trapped inside this endless chapter of torment and misery and this was your way out. Take it. This is a disaster! Okay, have fun being married for the rest of your lives. Annie, can... Annie. Hey. Hey. What's going on? I don't want to get married in October. Okay. When do you want to get married? Because we said, "no more postponing." That was the deal. I know. Do you want to get married to me? I want to want to. I have never wanted to want anything more in my whole life. You're my best friend in the world, but I don't wanna be a mom. I don't wanna be a wife, even your wife. Well, then, maybe you're just not ready, maybe... Do you wanna get married and you wanna have kids? Yeah. I want you to have those things. Please have a seat. "Annie. "Your drinking has affected me in the following ways." I missed you. I missed you. I was thinking that, um... When we get home that maybe we could start talking about potentially moving in together, if you feel like that's something you wanna start talking about. Uh, yeah. I could potentially be into um, starting that conversation. Cool. Nice to meet you. Thank you so much. Soon? We'll see you in October though, right? This was so fun. Okay. Bye! Okay, bye, guys. Everybody drive safe. Bye. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Uh, what about New Orleans? Could stay all night. Have you ever been to L.A.? No. Can I get you anything to drink? Yeah. Can I please have an orange juice? Actually, uh... No, don't worry. Orange juice is great. Thank you. You're welcome. Can I get you anything to drink?
