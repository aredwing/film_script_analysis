(SCREAMS) (MAN LAUGHING) I'll teach you, Nick, playing with another woman. Good morning. Good morning, sir. I'll teach you. Come here. Don't you run away from me. (SHOUTING) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (SHOUTING) MAN: Another for hanging! What did he steal? Strawberries? Apples. Oh, please, no hangings so close to my wedding. Here... Here's for your apples. Keep your money, Sir Ralph. They must learn. (GRUNTING) So hard a lesson. No wonder your tenants worship you. They'll worship you when we're married. Is worship the same as love? It's similar. Do you worship me? I'm very fond of you. Being fond, is that the same as love? It's similar. Thank you, sir. My lady. To the library. (DOOR CLOSES) Please, let me pass. In good time, cousin. You silly old women! BOTH: Old? You heard what I said. We're not as old as you are. There's a letter... For you, Caroline. In the library. BOTH: We wanted to tell her. She's coming. Barbara's coming to be my maid of honor. Is she... Pretty? Oh, she's more than pretty. Barbara has the most beautiful green eyes. Like emeralds. Cats have green eyes. I don't like cats. BOTH: We do! CAROLINE: Barbara, darling... (LAUGHS) You haven't changed! Not at all. Oh, your eyes are still so green. Oh, Ralph, this is Barbara. Charmed. Charmed. Doesn't she take your breath away? Well... Carol, you embarrass him. The two people I love most in the world. Come, let me show you the house. BARBARA: It's lovely. How many servants are they? Vanity, vanity. All is vanity. Think, when you're married you can have all the clothes you want. Go to London for the season, become a famous hostess. Ralph wouldn't care for that. A clever woman makes her husband do as she likes. Oh, this is a pretty dress. So are the others. I had them made specially to come here. Uncle Martin disapproved, of course, but I got round him. Now. Who is there that I should meet round here? Most of the landowners round here are married. Except for Ralph. He's the nicest, anyway. Yes. Skip. Skip. (GIGGLING) (SHUSHING) That's better. Was it? Now I curtsey. You step forward and raise me up. Then we kiss. What? All fashionable dances nowadays end with a kiss. I fear, then, I shall make no dancer. Go on. I expected the park to myself. It is early. Well, I always visit the farm before breakfast. I didn't know. Who told you, you could ride Fury? I chose him. He looked the most thoroughbred. He's wild and dangerous. I like danger. I believe you do. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Go on! Help! He's bolted! Ralph! Help me! Barbara! Barbara! Ralph. You look beautiful. (BOTH CRYING) What are you sniveling about? We can't help thinking... How different things might have been. Oh... You shouldn't put the veil on... Not before the day. I'm not superstitious. I'm just so happy. Caroline... Look. I must speak to you. Alone. Do you mind? If we're not wanted. Can't we stay? It's sure to be something exciting. AGATHA: We might be serving wenches or dressmakers. What is it, Barbara? What's the matter? I must go away. Go? Why? Don't ask, Caro. You can tell me. I mustn't see him again. See him? I'll be gone. Is it Ralph? Don't blame him. What happened? We love each other. He told you that? He didn't have to, I knew. Oh, don't worry. Ralph will marry you. We've agreed. I shall go away. (GASPS) MOLL: Oh, we're sorry now. Are you in love with Barbara? What do you mean? Do you worship her? Dazzled... I suppose I'm... You were never dazzled by me? Now, Caroline... You cared for me after father died. I looked after the house for you, I... Forgive me. I want to leave at once, if the coach could be ordered, please. Ralph is free. He can marry the one he loves. Caro, darling, I couldn't accept such a sacrifice. I'd rather break my own heart. No hearts are to be broken. The wedding can still take place, but with a different bride. Where are you going? I'm the one who needs the coach now. What's going on? Caro, this is your home. Please stay. Ralph's enemies will say he broke your heart. Put on a brave face, just for the wedding. Oh, perhaps you'd like me to be the maid of honor as well? Caro, darling, would you? (CRYING) See how I'm dressed, isn't it ridiculous? You can wear this, too, if you like. Wear that? I wouldn't be buried in it. (CHURCH BELL TOLLING) (FOLK MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTERING) Sir Ralph will be out of his senses when he sees you, Barbara. I don't know how you can stay so cool. BARBARA: What is there to be nervous about? What a thing to ask. The wedding day. The wedding night. (ALL GIGGLING) (KNOCK AT DOOR) Come. Mistress Barbara, your honored uncle awaits you below. This is a proud day for me, Barbara. Thank you, Uncle Martin. Sir Ralph is a fine man. You must love him very much. How could one fail to love a man as rich as he? That is no way to jest on your wedding day. (ALL CHEERING) I know how deeply you loved your mother. She was everything to me. This was her brooch. It was her dying wish that I give it to you on your wedding day. It's beautiful. I shall never part with it. It means more to me than the Skelton diamonds, my husband. Anything! Your mother was as good as she was beautiful. I'll never forgive God for taking her away from me, never! Never! (PEOPLE MURMURING) Why are those boys pulling her along? To show she's a maiden... Reluctant to enter the married state. If you ask me, Barbara should have those ribbons round the other way, to hold her back. Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. (CHATTERING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE LAUGHING) (EXCLAIMS) Come, Fred, let's get moving. (WOMEN GIGGLING) (WOMAN SCREAMS) Good God! What abomination! I told you we shouldn't have come in here! Let's get back. ALL: Kiss the bride! Kiss the bride! (ALL EXCLAIM) (LAUGHS) I trust the dance was to your satisfaction. Oh, come, my dear, mustn't be jealous of our new sister-in-law. (CHUCKLES) I need 100 pairs of feet and as many mouths to fill my obligation. Perhaps you should ask Caroline to help you. After all, you've shared so much. Henrietta. You mustn't be angry with your sister, Ralph. No woman can bear it when her husband finds another woman more attractive than she. (CHUCKLES) Lady Skelton, would you do me the honor? Forgive me, but... But? But, of course. Who are you? The man who would have married you had we met yesterday. You're very bold, sir. And you, my lady, are the most exciting woman I've ever seen. I fell in love with you at the church, as you were being led to the alter, to another man. Your jesting is in bad taste. It is no jest. I do believe you mean what you say. Young man, find yourself another partner. Look at Barbara, it's high time she was prepared for the bridal bed. But it is early yet. Find the bridesmaids and take her upstairs. Couldn't they manage without me? No, child. You are the maid of honor. Don't let them guess now. Very well. ALL: Kiss the bride! Kiss the bride! WOMAN 1: And she's only just got married. WOMAN 2: Oh, I think that's disgraceful. I think that's disgraceful. She goes too far. Barbara, it's time to go upstairs. Keep your kisses, you'll need them later. (ALL LAUGH) Lady Skelton dropped this. Take it to her, please. (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) WOMAN 1: Who is he, Barbara? WOMAN 2: He is good-looking. Come along, Barbara, you'll be late. Come along, Barbara, you mustn't keep your husband waiting. He asked me to give you this. That man there. Well, he'd make a good lover. Barbara can't have a lover yet. Let's go, Barbara. BARBARA: I don't want to go to bed. I want to dance and enjoy myself. You don't have to dance to enjoy yourself. (ALL LAUGHING) (WOMAN EXCLAIMS) WOMAN: Look! The blankets edged with satin. Oh, they don't look very warm. Barbara, you won't feel cold tonight. Courage! Our thoughts will be with you. They'll be ahead of you. (CHUCKLES) WOMEN: Come in! Go on, say it, Caroline. Your... Your bride awaits you. (ALL GIGGLING) Do you think he'll manage? Caroline, you've forgotten the blessing. I wish you the joy of one another. (MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTERING) Goodbye. Goodbye. Come along, Henrietta, we'll miss the play. HENRIETTA: Of course, we won't, Barbara. (CHATTERING) WOMAN: It is, it is. It is her, oh, yes. Look, Barbara, the King. Who is he with? Oh, it's the Villiers whore. BARBARA: Didn't he just make her a Duchess? HENRIETTA: Duchess of Cleveland. The quickest titles go to those who bed with the King. Still, Barbara, you have your title, don't you? (ALL EXCLAIM) He takes more than oranges from Nell Gwynne, they say. Come, Barbara, we shall be late for the play. The play can wait. Find out who she is. His Majesty seeks your name, my Lady. Lady Skelton is my wife. Tell the King she is not for the taking. Ralph, darling, Henrietta and I looked at the loveliest house in St. James's. Don't you think we ought to take a London residence? I do not. But, Ralph, we can't live in the country all the time. Of course you can, Barbara. You have your duty. A very handsome man was Lord Rashleigh. Buried in the West Indies. He married... (SNIFFING) He married a cousin on my father's side. (COUGHING) It's the east wind. It always brings on the Skelton cough. Well, she wasn't exactly my cousin, but my father and her stepmother were cousins once removed. Leave us. Oh, those stupid old hens! Well, if you looked to the housekeeping... Caro, dear Caro, not that again. Well, you've got to run the house sooner or later. I can't stay forever. (GASPS) Yes, Hogarth? I came, my Lady, to fetch a coat for the footman. "I will clothe thee with a change of raiment." Zechariah, Chapter 3, Verse 4. Hogarth... Yes, my Lady? That room at the top of the stairs, the one that's always locked... Ralph's great uncle was murdered there. Someone came up the hidden stairway. I want the key. It is an evil place. The key, if you please, Hogarth. It is wrong. Not you as well. Oh! It's so cold. It'll be all right when it's aired. Ralph won't like it. It's quite fashionable nowadays for husbands and wives to have separate rooms. Ralph is not a fashionable person. More is the pity, or he might have taken a house in London when I asked him. Where's the secret door? Up a bit, on the left. (SQUEAKING) Let's explore. Wouldn't it be useful if I had a lover? I was only teasing. Ralph's sister Lady Kingsclere and her husband are coming. I must see their room's ready. Henrietta, darling. I'm so glad you've come. Thank you, my dear. But you've taken away her sparkle, Ralph. And it's only been six weeks. You know, I was quite jealous of you, my dear. You looked so young and lovely. Is it only six weeks? Then it must be the journey that's tired you, Henrietta. Traveling does make one look so bedraggled. Caroline. How are things in London, Henrietta? It's been a brilliant season. Quite a brilliant season. Hardly an evening at home. Poor Henrietta, no wonder you look so worn. I'd rather look worn than dull. There's a new card game called ombre sweeping the town. The King's taken it up. I suppose you haven't even heard of it down here. On the contrary, I play it regularly. In that case we must test your skill, Barbara. For a regular player, you play a very irregular game. (LAUGHING) Fortune hasn't smiled on me, yet. Is that what it is? Why don't you stop, Barbara? Your luck may change tomorrow. Tomorrow you leave. Give me a chance to recover. Certainly, darling. It's only midnight. In London, that's when we wake up. Well, I'm no Londoner. I'm off to bed. Well, there's no need to wait up for me tonight. Well, I hadn't forgotten. Good night. Good night, Ralph. Tell me, my dear why is it you two sleep apart? Because, Henrietta darling, in one's own room it is easier to mind one's own business. It is you to play. Oh, Ralph, these things of Barbara's, I was taking them to her room. Well, that's kind of you. I believe it's quite fashionable nowadays for husbands and wives to have separate rooms. Indeed. Ralph, wouldn't it be a good idea if you took a place in London? Did some entertaining? Good idea for whom? For Barbara? I should have got more money from Ralph before he went to bed. Don't look so guilty, Kingsclere. Barbara knew we were experienced players. Old Ralph won't like it. We do him a favor. It'll teach Barbara to stick to more wifely pursuits. I'll play you for this. All on a single turn of the cards. Not fair, Henrietta, not fair. All the money on the table, against this brooch. Cut, then. Queen. It's pretty. I shall wear it when I'm next at court. Your mother's, was it? Thank heavens I can lie abed tomorrow when you leave for London, Kingsclere. You should come with me, Henrietta. I don't like you traveling alone and at evening. I promised Ralph I'd attend the local food... Whatever it is, some awful sort of dance they do. He's so democratic. Look out some highwayman fellow doesn't steal that. They say Captain Jackson rides in these parts. It might be worth the loss of a trinket to meet so bold and handsome a robber. Particularly a trinket so easily won. Good night. Good night, Barbara. MARTIN: This was your mother's brooch. BARBARA: I shall never part with it. KINGSCLERE: Look out some highwayman fellow doesn't steal it. HENRIETTA: A trinket so easily won. MARTIN: Your mother's brooch... KINGSCLERE: ...steal it. HENRIETTA: Easily won... KINGSCLERE: ...steal it. Why not? Now! (NEIGHING) (GASPS) (SCREAMS) Out! Out! (SCREAMING) Good sir, have pity on a defenseless woman. The jewels! No, please, Mr. Jackson, I have no jewels. (SCREAMS) I've heard, sir, how gallant you are with the ladies. If a kiss would satisfy you, or... Anything. No, not my brooch. Not my... (CRYING) No. After him! Shoot the scoundrel! Oh, my jewels! (SCREAMS) Missed! Incompetent lout! (SQUEAKING) HENRIETTA: Ralph! Open up, we've been robbed! (CLAMORING) What's the noise? Ralph! I've been robbed! HOGARTH: What is all this disturbance? Cover your nakedness! To your duties, all of you! Sluts! To your duties! Lady Kingsclere, ma'am, she's been robbed by a highwayman! Oh, it was terrible. I have been robbed and assaulted. These are dark times. Remove those beasts. They make confusion worse confounded. Oh, I still feel faint. (MOANING) Drink this brandy. It would choke me. I thought you'd manage... Now calm yourself, Henrietta. Tell us what happened. Ralph. Why, Henrietta, what brings you back? And so late. She's been robbed! By a highwayman! Captain Jackson himself. He didn't take my ruby brooch? He took everything! Was it Captain Jackson, Henrietta? I recognized him, it was. Is he dashing? Romantic? Handsome? Extremely handsome. Surely he wore a mask? It was a very small mask. Did he make... Ungentlemanly advances? Worse! Worse? What happened? I slapped his face. Oh, my God! I said, "You may take my jewels, but my honor no man shall tarnish." BOTH: What did he do? He took my jewels. And left you honor. How fortunate. He kissed me. BOTH: He kissed you? From his horse? Yes. The horse, like the mask, was a very little one? Barbara, at a time like this you try to make a fool of me? There is no need. The man must be found and hanged. I should think he's very clever. I don't think it's clever to hide like a beast and prey on defenseless travelers. Who are mostly armed. The highwayman has the advantage of surprise. But he must have great courage. Think of the excitement, the exhilaration, the danger. Once a man has taken to the road everything else must seem tame and dull. I don't see how he could give it up. No matter how determined are his pursuers. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Let us decide on the ways of catching this highwayman. I say hang the lot! You have to catch him, Lord Dolman, before you can hang him. It seems Jackson first appeared in these parts when your sister was held up. Yes, but an hour after Lady Kingsclere was robbed, Jackson was holding up the... York coach. A hundred miles away. The ladies say the gallant Captain works fast. (ALL LAUGH) You are to blame for the bastards. I am? You spoil your tenants, Sir Ralph. (ALL AGREEING) Thatch their roofs, put this new-fangled glass in their windows. Hang 'em all. ALL: Yes, hang 'em all. When it comes to violence against defenseless people, you will not find me lenient. Help me find this highwayman, and by God, I promise you, I'll hang him with my own hands. Who is it? Barbara, I want to talk to you about the highwayman. What about him? Well, they're blaming Ralph. Why? They say he's too lenient with his tenants and when he's sitting in judgment as a magistrate that he should pass stricter... What am I to do? Can't you take more interest in his work? What has happened between you and Ralph? Nothing. That's the trouble. You took him from me. If you hadn't given him to me so easily, I could have married the man I really love. You have a lover? I wish I had. We met, then we parted, because I was married to Ralph. I thought you were my friend. How could I... Don't start, Caroline. Once I begged you to stay, now I'm telling you, go! And leave Ralph to your tender mercies? He's all I've got. I'm not having you in his bed. (GASPS) You little fool. Ralph, come in. They've gone. What about the highwayman? Secret patrols, we'll catch the fellow unawares. You must tell me all about it. You see, dear, I take a great interest in Ralph's work. Darling, let's do as you ask, let's go up to London for a few weeks. Ralph, really, I'd rather not. But you complained so often about being buried in the country. I've changed my mind. There's an excitement in the country. I never saw it at first, but now I find it quite exciting. (HORSE NEIGHING) Get them up! (EXCLAIMING) Out! Come on! Whoa! Easy, easy. Steady. You do intend to rob them? Keep 'em up! You'll hang for this. Oh, no, no, no, not my rings. Please. Please. They've been in my family for centuries. (CRYING) (SOBBING) Come on! (WAILING) No! Damn gun's exploded. (BARBARA GRUNTS) Trespass on Jerry Jackson's territory, would you? A woman? (LAUGHING) Nearly a corpse, damn you! My leg, it's broken. Not likely. I'd heard you were gallant, Captain Jackson. Do you always jump on women and grab them by the throat? Not always by the throat. I'll have what you took. I did all the work. The road is mine. Half each, then. I'll consider that over supper. I dine with you? You might enjoy it. Evening, sir. (MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTERING) Hiya, Betsy! Here's my friend. Welcome to you, sir! Betsy, can we have something to eat upstairs? I told my friend here there are two things you do better than most women and one of them is cooking! For shame, Captain! In front of a stranger, too! BETSY: You know the way, Captain. Attend inside. I'll do that. Fetch the wine. This is the haunt of... Of the brotherhood. Or rather the best of them. I'm honored. Now, we'll have stewed carp, pigeon pie, a dish of neat's tongues, and some cheese, but not till I call. May I? You have seen. Not all. And it was dark. We cannot drink wine through masks. At your service, madam. You remind me of a man I knew. A lover? We met once. The moment was not propitious. Who are you? Does it matter? Priscilla, Dorothy, Barbara, take your choice. Barbara suits you best. Married. Your husband should know his business better than to drive you to find your pleasure on the highway. I've never yet deceived my husband. Then it's high time you began. What of the jewels? Keep them all. You're very generous, Captain Jackson. Mmm. So are you. And Jesus called them unto him and said, "Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not..." "...for such is the Kingdom of Heaven." My Lady knows the scriptures. Even I was a child once. What now? Morning, my lady. Money to the poor people, darling. Maryiot Cells has long been famed for its charity. (WOMAN EXCLAIMS) You are most generous, sir. Kindness itself. Hold still. This is all I'll take from you. I'll make her a gift. (EXCLAIMS) (HORSES APPROACHING) What's that? Someone's coming. (WHISPERING) BARBARA: Why the horse? I'd rather kill a man any day. JACKSON: If you're caught, and no one's dead, you can buy an acquittal. The first lesson on the road is not to be followed. I have a lot to learn. You do. You do. But there's time enough. The second lesson on the road is to learn to enjoy yourself. Let's go to the inn, come on. Good boy. Come on. Good boy. Where's Barbara? Abed, with one of her headaches. I love you, Caroline. You are fond of me. I love you. I love you, ever since I can remember. I'll get a divorce. Not possible. We must fight. We must part. Well, where will you go? To London, to my Uncle Martin. Please... I beg of you, don't make it difficult. (DOG BARKING) I baptize this child Luke Thomas. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. (ORGAN PLAYING) All people that on Earth Do dwell... (BLEATING) RALPH: Well, it seems only yesterday since we were here celebrating our young friend's wedding. MAN: Aye, he didn't waste no time, did he? (ALL LAUGHING) RALPH: Well, I know it was a disappointment to my friend Tom here, when his son Ned forsook farming for a more exciting life, but now there is another Cotterell to carry on the old tradition. To the future farmer Cotterell. (ALL CHEERING) And what is this new exciting life, Ned? I'm with the coaching company, Milady. A guard. Oh, indeed? I hope you guard your passengers well. Oh, no passengers, ma'am. I'm on the baggage coach. We take valuables. Valuables? Come now, Ned... I do that. Gold bullion and all. That's most exciting. When do you next do that? Well, Milady, I'm not supposed to say like... I understand, Ned. It's all right telling you. On this Thursday, gold, for a bank in London. It's not every highwayman that has a lady of quality for his doxy. Doxy? Me, a doxy? That means a lady of easy virtue, not usually the only lady. (LAUGHS) There is no other. Keep to that, my love. If you ever deceived me, I'd make a dangerous enemy. You make a dangerous partner. How? This plan of yours to rob the gold coach. (SIGHS) The odds are against us. It's by daylight, the guards are doubled. It is doubly exciting. We'll come to the gallows soon enough. Let's not race to get there. Life's too sweet to throw away. Then, I'll do it alone. I believe you would, too, green eyes. NED: So, I says to me wife, "I wager baby knows what we're talking about." So I says, "Cat's drunk baby's milk." Do you know what the little fella did? No idea. Lammed his milk straight at the cat! COACHMAN: Did he really? NED: Hey, what's that? Looks like an accident. Here, I'll go see. (SCREAMS) BARBARA: I'll get the horse. Here! (BARBARA PANTING) JACKSON: We've got as much as we can carry. BARBARA: Just this one more. Well, come on! JACKSON: Someone's following us! We'll outdistance him! Not with this damn gold, we won't! Aim lower, hit the horse! Ned! Ned! Ned! Ned, I aimed at the horse. (GASPS) My Lady! Is he? Dead! I told you to aim for the horse. We've got the gold, haven't we? That's worth killing a man for, isn't it? (WOMAN SCREAMS) BARBARA: "On September 14th, near Waterbrook Farm "in the Parish of Maiden Worthy "was committed by two men, murder and robbery on the highway to the value of "1,130 pounds. "Whoever shall deliver the said felons to Sir Ralph Skelton of Maryiot Cells "shall have their charges and 30 pounds reward with a further 20 pounds "to be paid upon one of the robbers convictioned for murder." So I'm valued at 20 pounds more than Jackson. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Come in. Yes, Hogarth? Is this your handkerchief, my Lady? What concern is it of yours? I found it at the spot where Ned Cotterell was murdered. The embroidery is of a "K," Hogarth. Not my name. I have seen you with it often in this house. You are mistaken. May the Lord have mercy on your unclean soul. How dare you! My soul was tortured with suspicion. The Lord commanded me to observe your movements. What do you mean? I have seen you leave at night dressed like a man of evil. I have seen you ride out with your horse's hooves shod with clothes. And I have seen you return. Once I saw you riding with another dressed in like fashion. I saw you embrace. Then you understand. I fear that I do. I have wrestled with the matter. Whether to dishonor the noble family I serve, or to remain silent and pray for your repentance. This highwayman had me in his power. He is one of the devil's men on earth. He forced me to rob, to do terrible things. He threatened to wash his hands in my blood as he did with poor Ned Cotterell. You swear you had no part in this? I have been bewitched, but not to kill, Hogarth. I know true goodness when I see it. You are good and you must be strong. Help me, Hogarth. Help me to save my soul. Poor, wretched sinner. It is not too late. Save me from the power of the devil. That the Lord should entrust His humble servant with such a mission. Promise me that henceforth you will lead a pure and blameless life? With all my heart. You will never communicate with that evil highwayman again? Never! Then your secret shall go with me to my grave. Let us pray. (ALL GIGGLING) Oh, I'm sorry. RALPH: "I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord. "Our feet shall stand within thy gates of Jerusalem. "Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together." HOGARTH: This column has the household items. Here is a list of the servants' wages, and here the outdoor staff... No, no more, good Hogarth. My mind is spinning. Will Heaven ever forgive me? There shall be more joy in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth. What should I do without you, good Hogarth? Let me give you some of my homemade fruit cordial. I'd like your opinion of the flavor. Excellent, my Lady. Just like Mistress Caroline used to make. It's practically the same recipe. Have you heard from the young mistress since she went to London? I fear not. I am told the city is in the grip of a great frost. People skating on the River Thames. Skating and sinning, too, no doubt. Yes, Hogarth. Sinning and skating. Let me try by myself. Be careful! Watch out! (EXCLAIMS) Why, Mr. Locksby! I'm afraid I... The last time we met, sir, you were kissing a friend of mine. On her wedding day. (LAUGHS) May I teach you to skate? Lady Skelton herself! Look at that coach! Good morning, Milady. And pray what can I show your Ladyship? Pray serve your other customers, Mrs. Munce. Oh, we are done, Lady Skelton. How is Sir Ralph? Quite well, thank you. And dear Mistress Caroline? She is in London. Oh, on a visit? For good I fear. Oh, how nice, how nice. I do hope she's having a great deal of fun. Good morning. Now Mrs. Price. Not that name, not here. The poison was not enough. Captain Jackson told me, Mrs. Price, you were reliable. Oh, the gentleman in question, he is not unwell? He is ill. Ill is not dead. MAN: Muffins! Fresh muffins! Come and get your muffins! You said today was to be special. Why? I'm going to seduce you. This seduction, am I to have a say in the matter? The less said. You said there was another. Now there is you. We were both sighing for the moon. We were. Oh, thank you, my Lady. Have you slept a little? What did the physician say, my Lady? He doesn't know quite what ails you. But with careful nursing... Here, this will make you feel better. No one could have a better nurse than you, my Lady. Sleep, Hogarth. "For Him that is joined to all the living, there is hope." "For the living know that they shall die, but the dead know not anything." Yes. Look, look at that. Will you marry me? Kit, I've told you, I'm in love with someone else. We can't both go on chasing shadows forever. Caroline! Is it all settled, then? Are you getting married? Not yet, sir. (LAUGHING) Keep at her, my boy. A letter came, it's marked urgent. Anything wrong, my dear? Hogarth is ill. Barbara's looking after him. The house is in chaos. Ralph wants me back to help. You came! Ralph said he'd sent for you. How is Hogarth? I would love to see him. He is very ill. Please leave Hogarth to me. My Lady, I know it won't be long now. Here, drink, you'll feel better. I'm not afraid to go but what would you do without my guidance? I don't know. Drink. Let me tell Sir Ralph, my Lady. He'll be able to help you after I'm gone. No, Hogarth. You'll tell no one! God in Heaven! What is it, Hogarth? Sir Ralph! Help! Help! Sir Ralph! Hogarth? Get Sir Ralph! HOGARTH: Sir Ralph, help! Sir Ralph! Good Hogarth, you must be quiet. Sir Ralph, quickly. He's coming. He's wandering in his mind. He can talk to Ralph when he's rested. Oh, Ralph, quick! Hogarth wants you. RALPH: I can't hear you. If only you'd left him to me! Or to us! (SHUSHING) Quiet! What did he say? His voice is so weak, I couldn't hear. Let me try, I'm used to him. Keep them back. He must have quiet. (GASPS) (MUFFLED GROANING) (MURMURING) I tried to hear. It was too late. Her Ladyship wore herself out nursing poor Hogarth. She needs rest. Caroline will stay with you. You are all so kind. But if you left, I could sleep. (MUSIC PLAYING) Captain Jackson, is he here? (EXCLAIMS) In his usual room upstairs. Barbara! She means nothing to me. What? This wench, cheap though she looks, will cost you dear! Who the fuck was that? (GLASS BREAKING) (DOG BARKING) "If you would catch Jerry Jackson go now to the Leaping Stag Inn." I've got hold of you, I got hold of you. (BOTH LAUGHING) Now! (SCREAMING) Come on, let's get inside, quick! (ALL SCREAMING) Will you all be drinking, then? Give us Jerry Jackson and there'll be no trouble. Jerry Jackson? Who's he? She's right. Who cares? We'll hang the lot of them! Just Jackson. I am. Take me, then I confess. It's me. Nonsense, my name's Jackson. It's me you want! (ALL LAUGHING) It's a small point, I know, but do any of you gentlemen know what Jerry Jackson looks like? Without his mask, I mean. There are those who have seen him. Let's have done with it and move them all to prison. We can find the one we want later. Did I hear my name called? Why, Captain! I knew he'd come. I would not have my friends inconvenienced or you, my dear Betsy, or you. We are outnumbered. These gentlemen have their accomplices all around the house. (ALL MURMURING) May I go upstairs and finish dressing? You're well enough dressed for a hanging. (ALL CHATTERING) A few seconds only. Thank you. (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) You bastards! Leave him alone! (GROANING) Well, it was worth a try, wasn't it? And now you hang. See what they call him? The most popular gallows-bird for the last 20 years. Another chop, Barbara? I see you get all the credit for his capture, Ralph. The credit's for the accomplice who betrayed him. I'll wager he's shaking in his shoes. Why should he? Jackson didn't give him away at the trial. HENRIETTA: There's still time. Ah, he's probably saving it up for his dying confession. They love to make a show on the gallows. I wish I could be there. I wonder if dare I put off the fitting of my new gown? Ralph will tell you all about it. I do not share the popular view that hanging is an entertainment. I shall not be going. What about you, Barbara? Don't you long to see him dangle? My dear, you've gone as white as a sheet. Just one of my headaches. I think I'll get some air. Ralph, will you order my carriage? Jerry Jackson's hanging today! Come on now, come on. Don't miss this opportunity now. Come on I've told James to keep well away from Tyburn. Are you sure you don't want... I'll be fine. Caroline! How are you? Well, thank you. I heard you were both in town. Good morning, Barbara. Where are you going so early? To take the air. May I come with you? Why don't you stay and entertain Ralph? Oh, no. It's you I came to see. Goodbye, Ralph. Oh, goodbye. BARBARA: Why do you force yourself upon me? CAROLINE: I want to talk to you about Ralph. You want him, you can have him. There, that should settle everything. You were in love with Ralph. You could be again. Heaven preserve us from your advice. I came to tell you I was getting married, Barbara. I won't come between you and Ralph anymore. Do I dance with glee? I thought it might help. James! James! James, stop the coach! Turn the horses towards Tyburn. The Master's orders were... My orders are Tyburn. And get there in time for the hanging! A beautiful souvenir of a beautiful hanging ladies and gents. But what's the greatest secret we may learn today? I'll tell you what it is. MAN: Make no mistake, they had been tipped off. So we may hear the name of the woman who betrayed Jerry Jackson! And they say it was a woman for sure. And I have my own ideas who it is! But I'll let Jerry Jackson tell you that one before the rope tightens round his neck! Here you see the Captain dingling dangling. I'll take one. Thank you. MAN 1: Thank you, my lady. Look, the legs and arms move. MAN 2: Ridiculous. Barbara, why have you come here? I've never seen an execution. It will be a new sensation. MAN 3: Here he comes! (CROWD CHEERING) (CRYING) JACKSON: It's good to see you all. Thank you. Thank you. Friends! My friends! My friends! I don't care whether you're for me or against me. All that matters is that you've come here today in your thousands to give me a grand send-off. To you lovely ladies I say... Don't throw your love, your caresses, your tears on villains like me. (CROWD GROANING) Save them for a man who's worth it. An honest, faithful man (CROWD LAUGHING) If you can find one! Right? To the men, I give a word of warning. Never put your faith in a woman. For no matter how much you may think she loves you, like as not, she'll betray you in the end! In my short and merry life, I've loved many. But only once have I ever, ever made the fatal mistake of trusting a woman. That's why I'm here! For believe me, friends, only a woman's hand could put a noose around the neck of Jerry Jackson! WOMAN: Find her and we'll hang her. (GASPS) (WHISPERING) Well, there it is, I've had my say. May God bless all my friends. (CHEERING) And may my enemies be hanged as I am! "The peace of God which passeth all understanding keep my heart and mind "in the knowledge and love of God..." That unfortunate highwayman has asked me to give you this letter. JACKSON: Well, my bold, bad Barbara. You're afraid of me at last. You needn't be. Jerry Jackson's not the man to whine now the reckoning's to be paid. But if you feel you owe me a kindness, give a share of our earnings to the girl by the coffin. She was with me that night at the inn. She was my doxy before I ever met you, and she stood by me. Farewell then, lovely Barbara. Until our next merry meeting. It seems he thought I looked kind. He wanted me to help that poor woman over there. Give her this purse and tell her I'm truly sorry for her. 'Tis true Christian charity, ma'am. May I read the letter? You may not. Be with me now and at the hour of my death. Amen. (ALL GROANING) (CHOKING) I don't want your money! I don't want no charity from no ladies in carriages! Jackson's putting up a game fight. Must have a neck like a bull. Let go of me! Let go! James! You think you can buy me? Do you think you can buy me? (GROANS) MAN: Keep them back. Let the girls fight it out themselves. Don't let them spoil our fun. Please do something! What's going on over there? (CHATTERING) One against one, that's fair. Anyone who tries to get through to them, sees me! (GROANING) That's Caroline! Come on! MAN: Come on, there's a fight over there. (CLAMORING) (SCREAMING) MAN: Whip her! Whip her! Whip her! Whip her! Whip her! Whip her! Whip her! (SCREAMS) (ALL SHOUTING) (SCREAMING) (CONTINUES SCREAMING) (PEOPLE SHOUTING) (LAUGHS) Follow me. (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) Barbara. (SCREAMING) Well, I'm most grateful to you. You averted a very unpleasant situation. I saw Caroline at the coach. (SCREAMING) I don't know why you went there, my dear. I did warn you. You must you must come back with us to Maryiot Cells. That's very kind of you, sir, but... Especially as you're now to be one of the family. One of the family? Did you not know, Barbara? Mr. Locksby and Caroline are to be married. No. I didn't know. You'll come too, Caroline? Caroline finds Maryiot Cells very dull. I don't think I'll find it dull this time. (DOOR OPENS) Sir Ralph, the highwayman Jackson. What, what of him? There was a riot around the coaches. In the excitement he was cut down. He may not be dead. They didn't name him lucky Jerry Jackson for nothing! (SCREAMS) Will you not come closer? They watch. I love you, Kit. I've kept it. Too late. Not if you love me. Soon I return to London. Tonight, I'll come to you in your room, while the others sleep. We risk too much. We risk nothing. I saw you, Locksby. Will you kill me? If I must. Promise you'll never see Barbara again. You must love her very much. You're engaged to Caroline, or have you forgotten? I've seen her robbed once of the man she loved. Not again. I will not see your wife again. (GASPS) Good evening, Lady Skelton. Jackson! What do you want? What a question to ask an old friend back from the grave. What do you think I want? You think I betrayed you. You're wrong. It wasn't... Ah, this isn't worthy of you, my darling. You always had the courage of your iniquity, didn't you? Do you know what it feels like to be strangled, my Lady Barbara? Do you? Do you? Do you feel the rope choking your windpipe? The world goes black choking the life out of you! With spots of vivid color flashing against the awful darkness. Your head bursts open, you kick and you struggle and you squirm! (PANTING) You know, after my friends cut me down it took them two hours to bring me round. And do you know what my first thought was? At last I know who she is. Isn't that strange? Just a few seconds after being saved from the scaffold, I thought of the crest on the Skelton coach and of you! And now you've found me? We pick up our life together just, where we left off. No. Things are different now. For the first time in my life, I'm in love. Am I so distasteful to you? Then I'll take my revenge and pleasure at the same time. (GROANS) No, you won't scream, you won't invite anyone in here with me. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Open the door. It's me Barbara. Kit! He won't see you, Barbara. He gave me his word. He will marry Caroline. Now go back to bed, Lady Skelton. You don't care for me. Let me go to him, Ralph. I beg of you. You and I are married. He and Caroline will leave with me tomorrow. I have business in London. I'll be back the next night. Now go to your room or by God I swear I'll drag you there by your hair and lock you in myself! Hurry up. ALL: Bye-bye. Bye-bye. To you, Caroline and Kit. May your marriage be blessed. Ralph, it's no good. What? I love you, Ralph. I'm fond of you, Kit, but I can't help it, I love Ralph. Did you order three pheasant? Or was it one pheasant, one roast pork and one lamb chop? Why, my Lady of Iniquity! Keep out of my way, Jackson! What words for your partner! What job are we doing? There'll be a coach here soon. Worthwhile? To me. After something special? A man's life. You never did like killing, did you, Jackson? You still have time to go. What's this poor devil ever done to you? He stands between me and everything I want. Who is he? My husband. You cannot. They'll think it was me seeking revenge on the man who captured me! Would you warn him, Captain Jackson? Would you turn on your old partner? (GROANING) Now we've both had revenge. To our next merry meeting in hell! Go on. It's probably a poacher shooting rabbits. Nothing to worry about. I fear nothing now. But won't Barbara be surprised to see us back? If only you two hadn't put up such a convincing performance of being in love. Why should four people spend their lives in misery when they could be so happy? It's like a fairy story. I get the man I love and Kit gets Barbara. Everyone gets what they want. (LAUGHS) Now, Fury! Easy, easy. Out! Jackson? I think I winged the fellow. RALPH: Let's be off. Go on! Go on! Where's her Ladyship? Retired early to bed, sir. One of her headaches. She asked not to be disturbed. Well, I think this is one occasion we might disobey her instructions. I'll call her. You two go and have a drink. Well, I won't say no to that. Barbara! Barbara! William, come here, please. I think her Ladyship may be ill. Can you break open the door? I said break it open! I'll try, Miss Caroline. It's all right, you may go. Very good, ma'am. (CHOKING) I'll send for a doctor. No Kit, Kit. Another? It is an occasion. What shall the toast be? Mine is to Barbara. Barbara's had an accident. She's asked for Kit. (KNOCK AT DOOR) What happened? Loving you has been the one good thing in my life. All your life has been good. (CRYING) No, I deceived you. You don't know what you're saying. I killed them. Killed? Ned, Hogarth, Jackson. And tonight, for you, I would have killed Ralph. You! It was for us. He stood in our way. Don't leave me, Kit. Don't leave me alone. (GROANS) Kit, take me in your arms. Hold me close. Kit, Kit, Kit! I'm frightened. I don't want to die alone. Don't let me die alone. Kit, Kit!
