Who wonder why I do not answer the phone myself. And why, anyway? I never talk to anybody today. So you can talk to me. A delivery does not count. It is not that. You're a guy... ...and you do not even know why. Explain it to me. There must be several reasons. But one essential. Your father was a dud. You were forced to succeed. And vice versa. This is simple: Failure breeds success and success, failure. But Boyd... ...stop crying on your own fate. Ms. Fairchild is not home. Do you know when she gets back? Try to join. - Where? In golf club, in beauty salon. 'S Why you really lucky. You always know where to find your wife. Just kidding. Why do you play golf? Do not like it. Knits fit me well.

They make fun of names. There are six employees. It bothers me, these chicks. They scream. You know a bank without women? This is an occupational hazard. Here, the risks are reduced. No armed guard and nothing but two cops away. How is the vault? A classic timer, four security... ...which opens every 15 minutes. In a quarter of an hour, you get caught. Of course, given how... We will operate 5 minutes before closing. I will draw the curtains and wait. In the street, nobody will be surprised. People say that the bank has closed, that's all. No exit. Is released through the front door. This is risky. - No. The key is to enter 5 minutes before closing time. A delay flanquerait any ground. At noon, armored door closes until Monday morning.

Your son and I are going to talk about it. Do not do that. We can not let this break that does not belong to him. Not now. Why did he do that? This is not a kind. This is very clear. Georgie's father was decorated war. Me, I graduated. This is simple. Hello. My brother? My car broke down 1500 meters here about. I can call you? Our religion forbids to have a phone. The bus pass from here? I'll buckle down and take you there. I bother you... I do have concern developed, brother. Approach, Martha. This man is thirsty. From the buttermilk would refresh. If you want to wait, brother. I will hasten. - There is no hurry. Thanks, you're very kind. There is a lot of work for one family here. This is the Lord's will. That yes. How's it going? I sleep. Thank you for defending me this afternoon. Georgie spoke? I realized seeing the broken frame. Sorry to have broken. This is nothing. Tell me why you did it. I do not know, Dad. Listen... We need you to understand... You do not have to be ashamed what I did during the war. Everyone can not receive medals. It takes all kinds to win a war. Was not asked my opinion. Order to remain at my post... ...and to extract the maximum copper. You see... All that a man like me can do for his son, is tell him the truth... ...strong and hope he understands. Look at me, Stevie. Every father wants to be a hero to his son. Some can not do it, that's all. Good night, Steve. - Good night, Dad. You have to open the shutter. Perspective and dimension, entire photo holds there. The photo is a nice hobby. You need a hobby, Gus. My name is Roy, Mr. Fairchild. Do you have any idea where I can find my wife? She gave me an appointment at the club... ...but it was not there. I've already said, Gus? My name is Roy. Yes, you said. We all need something family, wife or other... Me, I have my mania, Gus: Perspective and dimension... there is nothing better. A whiskey and soda, bartender. Hello, Roy. My name is Harry. Harry Reeves. Have you seen my wife? No, I have not seen. First, she told me to come, then she makes me say not come. She told you, Roy? Harry Reeves. The bank. This is a beautiful institution. I've used. You are our best customer. You work for us, Roy? Harry. I am the director of the bank. It is you who count the money? That is correct, Mr. Fairchild. You can call me Harry. This is your hobby, count? In a sense, yes. And a woman, Roy? You know how counting women? Must break them into small pieces. In any small pieces. Then we count all... ...all these dirty little pieces. Do not break the hardware, Mr. Fairchild. Sorry, I explained something. You know what you are, Roy? You are a reluqueur. It will attract trouble. We begin by ogling, and eventually married. I got married, Mr. Fairchild. Hi, Linda. She's cute. Do you attend? Do not say that. I am married. I do not even know. Let's fix that. Do not compromise me. If that's what you want... You should ask her to dance. You wanna dance with Linda? I can not dance. But you could keep him company. I like to see people dance. Of course, I dance very well. You have fun, Boyd? Call me Harry. Do you wanna dance? You could do it? Are you kidding? You have not known me student. Looks banker tongue. Talk. The balance well. Warning seasickness. You're a good dancer. 100% American. You always drink so much? Question usual. You are very unhappy? The bottom of the abyss. Where is your wife? Emily? She has a hobby. She has two or three per year. Do you want to be my hobby? I do not like advances. I present to you my most sincere apologies. Well, it's forgotten. I do not understand you. With your fortune, you would be spoiled for choice. My choice is you. Thank you. What tone. I'm effect of a Salesman spree. So sorry. A whiskey and soda. You know? You are really nice. I dare not say thank you. Where were you ten years ago? I passed my exams. A Milwaukee. I should be there. - Why? I got married. You happen he regret your mistakes? As everyone. Sure... Even mistakes we wanted to erase. If you and I... Excuse me. I forgot. Do not like advances. What kind? If we leave together? You're really drunk. No, I thought about it at leisure. Why me? You are to me beneficial. And if I said yes? We would leave immediately, wherever you want. Come. Dance brings counsel. Not easy to get up. - Sit. I found the perfect spot. A crazy, his wife and kids and not a neighbor. And if Slick waiting on a road without? For the police can identify the truck? It's safer that way. Ni telephone or car. Their religion forbids it. Kids, it paralyzes me. - Stop. You spoke to Slick? - There is an hour. Slick will have a hay truck, to go unnoticed. Here is how. Between 10:30 ET 10:40, you steal a car in the city. Good. At 11 hoo, we joined Slick and farm it occupies. At 11 h45, it is in the vicinity of the bank. You will call the cops to tell there was an accident on the road. The police car part, one enters the bank. 90000 dollars. Net taxes. At work. We pavoisera after. I did not expect you so soon. Your name? - Linda Sherman. What are you doing here? Do not take me up. I asked you what you do here. The question would be useless if you stayed with him. Out. Why not? I had stayed on to ensure that Boyd. I can take care of him alone. Well, that's new. Especially after ten years spent in demolished. Out. Do not rush me. I could take it elsewhere. We had other projects, but we did not do than talk. Another time, I do not know... I'll throw you out. You should try. I seek for an excuse to pull your hair. You do not have the courage. Hold on to him. Drunk or sober, this is the kind of man I have always dreamed of. Are you awake? I'm not on my plate. Insomnia... This is normal, on the verge of a serious job. Him, he sleeps like a good child. This is a good guy. Yes, it's true. The trouble is that it is inherently evil. Does it matter? He?? is on our side. Speaking of evil, there is no worse a wicked woman. And I thought of all the tiles that have brought me women. They will dump a man. Tell me that. Do you remember that I was married? This was a sacred number. At first, I thought I hit the jackpot. Skinny, but I love like this: Skin and bones. I wonder why I want to lean... Parmalee... That's how it was called. Do you remember? Yes, I remember. She dumped me for a mortician. A mortician shabby. It almost makes me happy. She had too many bad habits. She trailed all day in a Chinese robe. Always bathrobe. The real crazy manners. And from one end to the other of winter, it was cold. Every fortnight she passed me her cold. She has passed me fifty times its cold. I took there twitching sniffing it. It is time to get some sleep. We have a job tomorrow. There is a guy who is currently monitor the hotel. He walks his dog, that's all. You think... - Good night. I am on my guard. This is a guy walking his mutt. I am on my guard there is nothing to burn me. Good night. You have stolen, is not it? No need to answer, I'm sure. You can enter a salary, but not and accusing people. You prefer that I alert the police? Go to the alert. Chick. Go get the police. Your woman sleeping and you just see it undress. You are disgusting. Fetch the police, Mr. Rinse Mirettes. Boyd, wake up. Listen to me, I have to talk to you. This coffee. Awake. This is good, I get up. I was really drunk. Where is Linda? It is 4am. She is gone. She was nice to me. Effortlessly has a crush on you. From sympathy. No crush. You please him. She said. I'll remember. I mount it in my room. Wood here, Boyd. I would like to talk to you. A speech? Which one? I ruin the health drink so much? No... Or the divorce? You want to be a free woman? Libre, you already are. In the freest sense. Let's not fight tonight. Do not start again. Let's talk as the beginning of our marriage. At the time I did not drink and thought you liked me? I loved you then. I love you forever. A weekend two. To hear you, you look like you just having big trouble. You stopped loving me? No, alas... I'm the fool who always love you, drunk or sober. If you console think I worked hard. 'I struggled, but in vain.' I said that I made an effort. Thank you for your good intentions. What good. While you were sleeping, I thought so many things to tell you. I wanted to ask your forgiveness, you propose from here. We might start, far from the city, this mine. But it would have been for nothing. We would come to nothing. It never changes... the rest of us. You're a drunk and me... I am a drag. Where shall we go? Where? I spoke up. Could not remain hidden nowhere. It would eventually show. I feel your eyes observing me. Must try. Nothing exists, if you're not there. Historically, I feel that excruciating discomfort. When you leave, Wonder where you are and with whom, it chokes me. When this girl is gone, I went to sit in the dark. It is easier to tell his truths in the dark. I remembered everything I want to forget as soon as it emerged. Why did I all these things? What drives me? Am I sick? A sick to be cured? I have heard of women like me. These are sick people well should avoid. Do not say it, Emily. Do not talk that our projects start. Can we go? - Of course yes. There is nothing that we retain. Absolutely nothing. I love you, Emily. I love you, Boyd. I was vile and despicable... ...but I have not stopped loving you. We assemble the rifle when Slick will be there. Everything seems too easy. It worries me. There is 12 minutes. Do not leave fingerprints. Nothing beats cleanliness, to succeed once. You get ready for a war? You have spent time in jail? - Trop. I was stuck there 3 times. Including one because my firecracker was empty. Never again. I spend what time? - To 14.30. Be wise. - Yes, Dad. Hello, Mr. Martin. - Hello. I bought equipment for big fish. Your children are equipped? - Not yet. It will come. I hope to go fishing before closing with Stan. I hope so too. Can you drop me off? You will find a taxi there. Do not resist and all will be well. I want your car. Left, then straight. Let mount both waiting. Take the car and set me free. Do not tell me my job. Let's go. All right, then right by the high street. What is it? We need a car. It is you, the guy. There is no shortage of empty cars that park. The flight would soon be reported. Do not exceed 45 km / h. Fetch bags. Monte. Trailer his eyes. - With pleasure. You are just in time. The farm is less than a kilometer. The farmer, his wife and this one is in the barn stick. You will not have a door monitor pending us. In the barn, everyone. Go all in. You look ill, Mr. Reeves. A migraine. I go look for aspirin. I have. I'll buy. The air will do me good. I would like two cartridges of these cigarettes. You really recovered well. For once, I love the sun. Thanks for bringing debris tonight. I envelope? Do not bother, I'll put them in the suitcase. You're leaving? - Yes. Emily and I decided to take a trip. I take nothing. The traffic police? There was just an accident... Very serious. 30 km north of Bradenville, on the highway. We go to New York and then in London. Mr. Reeves. - Hello. My wife awaits to take travelers checks. I go immediately. Give me one more. 2 more minutes. Warn Dill. I stay near the door. You come to golf tomorrow? No. I travel. Traveling? - Yes, for long. My husband. Ah, I see. I'm happy for you. For both of you. Thank you. Farewell. Sorry to keep you waiting. I would travelers checks. Certainly. For how much? For 5000 dollars. There is plenty to do around the world. We seek to enjoy a renaissance. How? Not important. How do you compensate? Cash. Excuse me. I received impertinent letters. I delete my current account home. This looks Miss Dowd. I want to settle with yourself. This letter was signed by you. I sign all mail. You have hidden talents, Mr. Reeves. Excuse me, closure approach. See the second wicket, Miss Braden. Checks $ 100 you go? I think so. You have not seen where is the driver? No, I'm sorry. Let us seek dad. - Encaissons first check. Hello, Mrs. Martin. - Hello, Molly. I want a receipt. Nobody move. This is a holdup. Do not resist and all will be well. Get out of your cage. Let your hands visible. Do not move. The vault opens in 2 minutes. This is my money. Give it me. Enough. Leave her alone. Sit, I'll buterais quickly. Drop it. Come here, boy. Paste it up in the mouth and goes to your place. Thank you. - Nothing. Do not do that anymore. The trunk is opened. Let us of what we have. A few bundles. We've had enough. Come on. Everything is ready. Clear the way. Off. My name is Martin. They forced me to drive my car in. There is nothing cutting edge here to cut my links? Down? They removed the ladder. There remains a with a shotgun. Push your legs. Eh. You. Help. Who was that? Which called? I release you and I back off. Thank you, brother. Is he dead? - Yes. God forgive you. - It was him or us. Vengeance belongs only to the Lord. We will discuss later. They'll be back. Must quickly from their truck. We leave point here. No sermons. This is put yours away. Let no one near the door. It is out of the barn? Where is Slick? - Maybe in the truck. I'll take a look. He cartridges on him? I can not bring myself to an act of violence. You want them to kill us? The Lord will protect us. It is not in the truck and the key is not there. This is a bad sign. - Wait. Can you hear me, in the barn? Yes, I hear you. Where is our friend? Come and get it. It must have the gun... and the key. Take his car. - It would soon be spotted. Let the truck. - Must be the key. Let us first if the rifle. We'll know. Now we know. Can you hear me in the barn? Yes. I see you, too. Is not looking for stories. Start key and hand. Do not play the hero. There are currently no other way? Load the bags in the truck. Fetch other at the front. You have two minutes... ...and then setting fire to the barn. Brother... Do not be afraid of evil. Did you hear? They will set fire to the barn and force entry. Only God willing. Are you ready for the rififi? If by 'Rififi' you mean resistance to evil, we are ready for Rififi, brother. So, you decided? Brings stone. Move back. Down. I go to the car. Cover me. Smother the fire with bags. Give it to me. It is shot in the shoulder. Merciful God forgive me. Come help yours, buddy. Everything's fine, Mr. Reeves. You want to sleep yet? You'll be better that way. Do not move especially. I will survive? Course. Tomorrow or Monday, you return home. I'll bring your wife. No. I speak to you. This can wait. You must, as I have the courage. After that, I will be ashamed. This is my attitude... ...to you. When you dvoriez me Eye drugstore, to the bank and in the bar? Do not think. Did you know? Of course, I am a woman. You confessed, relax now. This is not all. I also talk about the night. I went out to walk my dog. I expect you to be back. And I stayed up watching the street... ...as it was lit. That I did not know. I could not help myself. This is over and it will serve as a lesson to both. I draw my curtains now. It was awful to see. As if it had never been alive. Never. Talk, Boyd, empty your heart. This is so strange. There are a few hours, we were in the living room... ...and talk about our trip. Emily drank coffee, I remember. She was on the couch, full of life and health. Do you mind that I keep talking? I am looking for an explanation, that's all. This is so stupid to be alive in the morning and died afternoon. Everything we had planned remains suspended halfway. All that was left open... ...will never be completed. You know, Emily had always been afraid to be a mother. We decided from and have children. This morning she told me she had no fear. She knew she would soon die. I made the account: He only had 4 hours to live. I take you home. Go away in an instant. I do not want you to see me cry. I was looking forward to see you. They hurt you? Not too much. But our fishing will be delayed. This is nothing. I told Georgie. Thou hast killed them all? Look, Stevie. It would be better that these things never happen you. You're the one who could do that. Father Georgie would have been afraid. Who told you I did not have fear? Being afraid is human. No one is a perfect hero. Except you. Do you mind if Georgie see you? Course. This is good, guys. Enter. How's tricks? Well, old man.
