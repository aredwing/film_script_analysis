You should get stitched up. You must have a concussion. Who cares? Who cares? I do. Your eye's bloody. It was my fault again. I was driving when we hit the mine. You should talk to someone. You should talk to someone. There are no words. Know where I was when my son drowned? In the kitchen fucking my husband. Think I don't blame myself? You never get over it.

It's the hospital. It's Thomas. Excuse me. - Yes? Excuse me. - Yes? My son is here. Thomas. Yes. Excuse me,just a second. Marie? I'm swamped, can you step in? Can I help you?

The doctor will come as soon as she can. Thanks. Thanks. You're still here? I was waiting for you. Is your shift over? I saw the mom. I'll stay a bit. A shitty situation. You wait, no one tells you anything. How is he? He just came out of OR. Go home. What for? Get some sleep. It's not advisable. Concussion. Anyway, I hardly ever sleep, so... I'll be frank. She knows he was hit by an ambulance driver. So don't stay here. Leave. Wait. Wait! - Sophie, take it easy. It was you, rig ht? Of course it was you. I should say it's not your fault. It was an accident. Accidents happen all the time. But it's my son. If he dies... - I didn't see him. He ca me out of nowhere. Sophie, stop! It's pointless. Please calm down, madame. Come with me. Go on, Sophie. Come with me. I'm sorry. What were you thinking? I told you to leave. I know why you're filming it here. It wasn't for Thomas or me. You wanted me like this. To see me fragile, in danger. It's not our fault, Sophie. If Thomas dies I won't forgive you. Go back to the studio. Have my things sent over. I can't be that woman anymore. Don't you want me to stay? You heard. He's stable. Leave me. I need to be alone. We'll finish the film, then you and me are over. They said I'd find you here. I owe you an apology. We're used to it. To your friend, too. He saved my son's life, after all. The doctor says he has a heart malformation. He would've died... but for the accident. We were always told it was asthma. Come. We'd quarreled. I hadn't seen him in 3 years. I was never a good mother. I never had what it takes. Do you have children? Yes. Yes, a boy. How old? A bit younger than yours. How is it with him? It's never simple. He lives with my mother-in-law. Things became complicated when my husband died. I came to work here soon after. With school, I couldn't keep him. No, I didn't... I didn't want him. It's like you never do the right thing. I'm sorry. You're lucky. Your son is alive. Yours too. Good luck. He woke up half an hour ago. You mustn't tire him. He may have memory loss at first. You have a good son. He's built strong. I'm here now. Do you remember what happened? A restaurant... My birthday. You gave me a box. My father... You wouldn't say. Then it goes blank. You never thought not knowing might be a lesser evil? I'd gone to have an abortion. The doctor asked if I was ready. I panicked. I couldn't do it. Remember when you were six? You said your father was a spy. An astronaut. I said he was an astronaut. Your father was neither. You weren't conceived in love. Just the opposite. You have his eyes, his hands, his mouth... the same voice as him. What are you saying? There was no consent involved. He paid dearly to erase you from his life. If you still want to know, it's in the box. Open it or throw it away. You need to sleep. I'll stay with you. I love you. Attention, code blue, room 416. His heart. Move back. Thomas, are you with me? Stay with me, do you hear? He's having an attack. Careful, shock! Hi, I saw your ad in the paper. I wanted to ask about the 2-bedroom you're renting... Hold on, I have another call. Hello? Yes. Who is this? Where? No,I... I'm not far. OK, I'm on my way. Yes, hi. Sorry, can I call you back in an hour? Yes, Marie. Marie Santerre. Thanks, bye. Meeting your boyfriend? Yeah, to finish what we started yesterday. Could you give me a lift? Hello. Hi. You must be Marie. Yes. I found your number in his phone. I didn't know who to call. I figured since he mentions you so often... Pierre? Pierre, wake up. Usually I don't mind, but with all the blood... How much did he drink? - Not much. What do I owe you? No worries. He'll settle next time. Take care of him. He's not a bad guy. He got dealt a few unlucky hands. Thanks. Let's go. Get up, on your feet. C'mon. See you. Here. Thanks. Working tonight? No. Want me to call to ask how he is? - No. Lemme see. Wait. What do you have planned? I'm driving out to visit my son. Can I come with you? Sure. Feeling OK? Better, yeah. You ready? We're never ready for that. Paradise Boulevard, scene 89, shot 1, 1. Framed. In 3,2,1... Action! Hello, you. There'll only be the two of us. That's enough, you'll see.
