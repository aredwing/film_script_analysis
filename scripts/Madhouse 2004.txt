Excuse me, do you know where I can find Dr. Franks? It doesn't like it when you say that! - And it doesn't like you! - Leave him alone. Can't you tell he doesn't like you touching him like that? It doesn't like it when you say that. And it doesn't like you either, Puddles! It's too fucking bad! That's enough, Puddles. I'm Dr. Hendricks. Clark Stevens. Welcome to Cunningham Hall. Thank you very much. I hope you don't mind I let myself in. No, we've been expecting you. Well, my train ran a little late. And it's hard to find a cab to take you out here. - Yet here you are. - Yes, here I am. We should probably begin with a series of psychiatric tests... to make sure we start with a clean bill of mental health... Followed by a thorough physical. - Betty. - Mr. Franklin. What did we talk about when we said no more pretending we're a doctor? - But, but I was... - I know, Mr. Franklin. Why don't you go back in the rec room and make yourself at home? Nurse Hendricks is going to serve Pudding Pops. - Won't that be nice? - Very nice. - Good boy! - It was nice to meet you. - Hi. I'm Betty Donner. - Clark Stevens. I'm the Administration Coordinator. I'm sorry I missed you up front. I just stepped away for a moment. Don't worry about it. I'm glad to finally meet you. Same here. We are so excited about your coming in to lend us a hand. I'm excited about getting to work. Wonderful. Wonderful. Perfect. I'll have your badge ready for you in a few days. I need you to fill out these forms... so you get school credit. Blue card on the bottom's for emergency information. Your keys to the kingdom. - Thank you. - And your walkie-talkie. That's how we communicate here. You'll stay in a cottage on the south side of the building. Well, there's only one thing left. - What's that? - To meet the big cheese. Dr. Franks. Very good. Hello, Betty. I take it this place has been around for a while. Since 1918. You should have seen the shape it was before we spruced it all up. It took our patient clean-up committee... a year and a half to get it to this point. They've done such a marvelous job. Absolutely. No, I'm sure. It's just... It seems a little rundown. Not particularly conducive to rehabilitation. For some of the patients, that will never happen. - Get me out of here. - Carl! I shouldn't be here! No one should. - Carl... - It's okay. They don't let you go home even when they know you're better. Why do you say that? Because the people running this place... are really the crazy ones. Guilty as charged. Now run along. Go on, scoot! Have a seat. The doctor will be with you momentarily. - Good luck. - Thank you very much, Betty. 'Einstein also believed... some chronic schizophrenics were... misdiagnosed due to possible psychokinetic conditions... such as their ability to see paranormal activities.' Not a pleasant way to receive mental health treatment. I received your records from the university. 4.0 average. My, my. You have the potential to follow in your grandfather's footsteps. Thank you. I hope so. My internship here is all I need to get my degree. - Then what? - Well... to take residence in a mental health facility as a counselor. That goes without saying. What's going on with these? Put them in a cup, Polly. Sorry, Dr. Franks. My minor, sir, is in administrations. I'd love to work in a place like Cunningham Hall. Maybe design an updated curriculum. I researched the building and its operating procedures. I made notes. Little changes we might implement... during my stay. Mr. Stevens... I hope you understand what you've gotten yourself into here. - I'm sorry? - This isn't a summer camp. We have neither funding nor time for anything but patient maintenance. I absolutely understand that has to be the priority, but... You want to empty bedpans to make your grades better... great. But you're not in class... reading about life in a mental institute. You've arrived. I didn't mean any disrespect. I just thought... Let me be blunt. You're not here to think. If you want to be on my staff, I want you to focus on the objective. - That is? - Maintenance of the mentally ill. Make no mistake. There are serious reasons why... a person would be locked up in here. Where is this wonder boy I have heard so much about? Dr. Morton, Dr. Douglas. - Clark Stevens. - Nice to meet you. It is you. I'd recognize you anywhere. I met your grandfather... at the Chicago Conference of Mental Health Sciences in '75. He and I went on such a bender... I was discussing our operating procedures with Mr. Stevens. We've come to an understanding. Introduce him to Sara, then she can give him the grand tour. I like to give my favorites a little extra. You never know when you might need a little favor. Noted. So you survived the Franks interview. - Yes. Just barely. - Some say it's the worst... shock treatment the hospital offers. I can't argue with that. He's kind of a shark, the bottom line's if you work hard... he'll hire you full-time. That's what he did with me. I would just ideally love to help change this place. Improve it a bit. That's what we all say... until the third time you're stabbed with a pencil. Point taken. When did you start working here? Last year. I served the same internship you did. So you graduated last year? You're a year older than me. Which means you have to do everything I say. Come on. I'll be your tour guide today. This is B ward. Group therapy's in there. Showers, med station. We keep it locked for obvious reasons. Also we keep some low security risk patients here. Ladies' rooms. Your duties will range from monitoring patients... sitting on group therapy sessions... to assisting staff. Speaking of which, brace yourself. Nurse Hendricks. Sara. - You must be Clark. - Yes, indeed. Nice to meet you. - He's the new intern. - Of course he is. I'm Anabelle Hendricks, head nurse. - Pleasure. - I wondered where you went to. Seems to be a regular occurrence lately. I'm sorry, I haven't been feeling well. You'll assist Nurse Hendricks as well as other staff. - I look forward to it. - So do I. It will be nice to have a little muscle here. May I speak with you in the office, please? Sure. He's been up there... for months. Who has? - We need to change the prescription. - I signed off on everything. You need to be there at precisely... Sara? Do you understand? - Ready for more? - Sure. - Enjoy your stay here, Clark. - Thank you very much. What a bitch. Come on. That's Crystal. She's our resident nymphomaniac. - Come on. - Where are we going? To the unpleasant part of this job. Where we keep high-risk patients. You won't often be asked to come down here. Trust me, it's a good thing. What is it? Housing for potential murderers, lunatics... Your everyday garden-variety maniacs. - That sounds interesting. - Look... this is where they tuck away people everyone wants to forget. The ones you never hear about. Unless they have the chance to act on their natural instinct. Which is? To rip you limb from limb. Welcome to the madhouse. After you. Wallace. Hey, sugar. They been asking for you all day. This is Clark. He'll be with us for a while. My condolences. Here you go. He's going to need your belt. Here's the drill. Stay behind the yellow line at all times. If you need help... push the alarm at the end of the hall. I need your pen... and any other sharp objects on you. They can't get out, can they? That's what they keep telling me. Nice to meet you. - Ready for this? - Sure. I've volunteered in a couple of hospitals before. I can't believe they keep patients down here. Run into that on your volunteer work? Let me out. I have something for you. Where are you going? Where are you going? You are not going to leave me down here! Get back here and hook a sister up! Severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. She has to do everything in sets of nine. Including the doses of strychnine... she gave her preschool class. - Paranoid? - Homicidal. Sara! Sara! - Sara, help! - No, it's okay. It's okay. Drake! Royce is at it again. Can you bring his meds down? Royce, calm down! It will be fine. Drake's on his way with your meds. God! Sara! Let go! Let go! Drake! It's all right. He didn't hurt me! Drake! He didn't hurt us. Let's hope he gets it right next time. Here, big guy. Thanks, kid. I owe you one. Let's get out of here. Betty, this is Wallace. I'm heading home. Drake is here. Dottie's got a roast waiting that has my name all over it. That's a big 10-4, Wallace. You have a nice evening. Over. 10-4, Betty. You, too. Over and out. Hello? Hey, I saw you. Why don't you come out and introduce yourself? Drake, are you still here? I could use help. I have a situation in the rec room. Once again, Alice... are you going to do what your caretaker is requesting of you? You're hurting my arm! I'm trying to make sure you don't hurt yourself. Take your pills if you want to get better. Doesn't that make sense, sweetheart? I'm going to ask that you take your medication... or I'm afraid I'll have to resort to disciplinary measures. He'll watch when you are sleeping. Do we have an understanding? Do you think I enjoy hurting you like this? That medicine don't work on me! Alice! - Stop! - Bite your tongue, Carl! You're hurting her! Get away from me, you faggot! - It's okay. - Drake! You get back! It's late for you, isn't it? It wants me to go to sleep now. Let's go. Kid! Unbelievable. I saw you come down here. Why don't you come out? Hey, kid, come on. This isn't a good place to be. You could get... hurt. Safety alarm at the end of the hall. - Jesus! - There's no one in there. Dr. Morton, how long have you worked here? I've worked here for 27 years. - That's a long time. - You have no idea. That were you doing down there after hours? I followed the little boy. That kid running around. He broke into my room. I chased him to see who he was. It's strange that he runs around here at night. I guess the whole place is a little strange - Occupational hazard. - I guess so. That noise I keep hearing, what is that? It sounds like it comes from the basement. I figured it was the water pipes? Maybe. Well, what is it? It's an old building. It can be a variety of things. - But... - Buildings are like people. They remember everything that happened to them through time. Sometimes... they don't like what they remember. - What do you mean? - A while back... we had a patient down in Cell 44. He was the saddest sickest subject I've ever come across. One night he... dug himself out... but he got turned around and couldn't find his way. What happened? He jumped out a third-story window. Did he die? Some say he died when he hit the ground. Some say they caught him and locked him back up. But I... I believe he's still here... trying to dig his way out and go home. You believe that? Either that or he came back to run this place. Mr. Stevens... I have a wet cleanup in the TV room. If you're not too busy, perhaps you could mop it up? Sure. Sneaking around... leaving maximum security open. You've had quite a first night, Mr. Stevens. - I wasn't sneaking around. - Speak to me. Nurse Hendricks called for help over the radio and I came. And? And I got to the rec room and realized she didn't need help... being that she was using a taser on a patient. Some patients have to be constantly reminded... who has the upper hand. Refusing to take medication doesn't warrant an electrical burn. - Stevens... - This place is a mess. It's dirty, it's unsafe, it's understaffed. Are you aware there are children running around here at night? No one gets in or out without my authorization. What about the patient that escaped from the basement? Dr. Morton told me about... a patient who escaped. Dr. Morton doesn't know what he's talking about. Look, let's start over again, all right? While it's no secret this place could use fixing up... most of the patients housed here are content. You know why? They have no place else to go. I'll make you a deal. Stick to the rules, mind your own business. I'll consider some of the suggestions you put together. Are we in agreement, Mr. Stevens? Fine. Well, hello there, busy bee. Good morning. What are you trying to pull here? I have no idea what you're talking about. Albert, things will change here... or I'm placing a call to the board. I know what you are up to. Hey, new guy! Hey there. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm on my way back to my room. Do you want to sit in on an obsessive-compulsive group... at 3:30? It's my own little session. It sounds great, really... But, I don't want to get into any more hot water. - Why, what's wrong? - Nothing. I was in Frank's office and I saw something weird. He has a lot of weird books. One, in particular on his desk... he put it away when he realized I saw it. Are you sure you're not a private detective disguised as an intern? - I'm a dork? - You're a dork. The guy reads weird books. Maybe he's learning about his bedside manner. Sara, to the nurses' station, please. Copy. - Got to go. - Good luck. Good night, Nurse Hendricks. - Everyone in bed? - All tucked in. I'm almost done. If you don't need anything I'll go lay down. I'll check it out. Is there something we can help you with? It's bedtime! I don't have time for foolishness! Come out and show yourself. I don't have time to waste and I don't want to hurt you. Who are you? You are only hurting yourself. Well... I suppose if you aren't going to come out... you'll have to make yourself cozy until Drake arrives. He'll find a way to convince you to go back to your room. Stop! Why are you doing this? Stop! I know you're all devastated by what happened. I want to know which patient did this and I want to know by tonight. Betty will assign each of you a section. I want you to interview the residents. They trust you. I want you to use that trust. Keep the authorities out, or the patients will give you nothing. Then we will thoroughly review the security and safety protocol. - Let's get going. - Roger that. I can't believe this happened. I worked with her for 25 years. She was such a nice lady. Dr. Morton? Get Dr. Shores, take the West Wing. Everything's okay. Dr. Douglas said she was with you before it happened. - Did you see anyone? - We heard someone in the hall... and she went to check it out. Then I heard loud music and I... They think a patient did it? Clark! You and Drake are in the basement. Don't be afraid, Clarkie. I'll protect you. All right. I have to go. Yeah, sure. - We didn't see... - Anything. - We were sleeping. - Our door is locked. Tight as a drum. Are you dating Sara? If you remember anything, let me know. I'll kill you, you freak! I'll make sure you rot there the rest of your life! What's wrong? I'll teach this freak to show respect. Take a break. I'm almost done here. I'll be out in a minute. Why don't you come inside and I'll make us a Remy Martins? It's the ones who protest too much... that end up wearing their wives' panties! Why won't you talk to me? It might help you sort things out. How does it feel to be convinced something is there... when logic tells you it's not? I thought I was hearing things. Now you know what madness feels like. That's a feeling you'll never forget. Why are you sitting in the dark? lllumination only reminds me of what I've become. What's your name? That's a subjective question. There was a problem here last night. So we're taking time with each resident... asking them if they heard or saw anything unusual. Funny you'd ask a madman... if he's seen anything unusual. All right, thank you. Pretty strange place, this Cunningham Hall. - How so? - Bad things going down here. But you know that. What kind of bad things? Take that sick individual lurking around, for instance. Someone who's comforted by the warmth of fresh blood. Who do you think it is? You're a smart boy, you'll figure it out. Is it you? The top of the food chain would be a good place to start looking. Are you speaking of Dr. Franks? They're cell numbers on a prescription to me. Go to Betty or Wallace to find out who the hell they are. They wouldn't know their own names if you asked them. Can you tell me what the patient in cell 44 was diagnosed with? I just keep them doped up. Do you know what medication he's on? You sure have a lot of questions. Risperdex. That's what they're all on down there. - An antidepressant. - Have you seen the place? Thank you, Grace. You're breaking rule number one... about working in a place like this. What's that? Taking what the patients say seriously. I'm not. Believe me, I'm not. I did hear Hendricks and Franks arguing... the night she got killed. You have to understand these patients are totally delusional. They'll tell you things they actually believe to be true. But hardcore schizophrenics in particular can't be trusted. Take what they say with a grain of salt. I understand that. It just seemed weird. He was being cryptic. They're paranoid. They have it out for Franks because he's keeping them locked in here. You're reading too much into this conversation. You can never trust a schizo. Why are all the patients in the basement... on the same medication? Because I'm sure they're keeping them seriously tranquilized. I used to love to play outside this time of day. Me and my friends. We played kick-the-can... sometimes dodge ball. I was good at that. Too afraid of getting hit by the ball, I guess. Then one day things started to go bad. How so? I started seeing stuff. Stuff before it happened. One day my parents dropped me off here to have some tests run. And they never came back. That's a rough thing to carry with you. You can try to steer your life in the direction you want, but... everything happens as it's meant to be. Maybe so. I think you're not meant to be here anymore. You're right. But the day I leave here... will be the day that I'm dead. That's one of the bad things about knowing stuff before it happens. My little problem... stems from the fact... I was never allowed to get in touch with my inner child. I'm a vulnerable child... trapped inside an adult's body. And wearing an adult diaper. - Up yours, Jimmy! - Okay, calm down. Look, we're all grieving right now. Some of us feel vulnerable... or depressed. Or scared. That's right, Alice. What makes you feel scared? It won't stop scaring me. What won't? I try to close my eyes, make it go away. It's always right there, watching me. What is this 'it' that you're referring to? The ghost. What ghost? The one that runs through the house at night. It's always watching me through the windows. What does it want from you? To make sure that I never forget what madness feels like. It's Betty. Did I awake you? Not at all. I was just getting up. Great. I wanted you to know your badge is ready. Dr. Franks wants to know if you had anything to report... from yesterday's interviews. I've still got one more patient I'd love to talk to down there... but it seems like they were all in their cells. Drake checked the locks and it didn't appear they could get out. Just keep me posted. I've got to type up... the findings and give them to the investigator. Okay. Fantastic. So nice of you to come down. We seldom get visitors down here in our little pit of despair. Why did you stop talking to me last time I was down here? I'd run out of things to say. Why don't you come into the light where I can see you? Come on, we're friends by now. Let's just say I suffered a slight disfigurement as a child. Since then, I choose to live in the shadows. All right, then. Can you get out of this cell? Only if someone lets me. No more talking in circles. Answer the question. Are you wondering if that little boy you keep seeing... is somehow getting the keys and letting me out? What little boy? Now who's talking in circles? Clark, I've got Sara on line one out here. I'll be right up. We'll continue this conversation later? You can call me Ben. We have to stop meeting like this. What will the patients say? I think it's a little late for that. So, did you finish up your interviews? Basically. What are you taking? Oh, I have a cold. I interviewed all the patients that I was assigned to. - Their stories were out there. - Mine too. Mrs. Idelson told me that the guy from 'Wheel of Fortune' did it. That's possible. I had one guy, he's interesting... but I don't think he knows anything. Sic Franks on him. Let the cops do the rest. Hang on, I forgot a fork. What are you doing? I'm sorry. They were sticking out of your purse. Some cold, huh? Why you taking Risperdex? Here goes. When I was a little girl I had problems focusing... and I was later diagnosed with really minor schizophrenia. But I got put on Risperdex and it leveled me out. I haven't really had any symptoms since I was a kid. Is that how you got interested in mental health? Still want to be my friend? Sure. Crazy chicks are wild. - You jerk. - I'm kidding. You're all right now? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. - Look, don't tell anyone. - I won't. - Those pills are red. - So? The Risperdex Grace showed me, the pills were blue. I'm sure a bunch of psychos are on a much stronger dose than I am. This is the only way out, Sara! Carl finally got to go home. Please go to your rooms! Ghosts. Would somebody get Dr. Franks on the radio! - What happened? - I was bringing in the games. We were going to play Chutes 'n' Ladders, then this. Maybe he hated Chutes 'n' Ladders. Did you see him talking to anyone before he came in? He went out to get his medication. - What was he given? - An antidepressant? - Grace! Was Carl just here? - Half hour ago. - Did you see him talking to anybody? - Other than himself? No. - What did you give him? - What I always do. Are we starting with Q&A again? Because I don't have time. Grace, I'm sorry, what did you give him? I gave him his usual dose of Happy Tabs. Thank you. - Ben! - I haven't gone anywhere. You said something about the medication they gave you. - Does it help? - I wouldn't know. I don't take it. But I do have a nice mosaic on the wall... I've done with my unused pills. But, Ben, why don't you take it? They wouldn't help me if I did. Why not? A hospital is a place of business. When people get better... there are less bodies in bed. Doesn't that make sense? They give patients weak medication to keep them sick? Look around you. The loonies here only seem to get worse. Take your friend Carl, for instance. He took his meds, like a good boy. And look what happened to him. How do you know about Carl? Did I say something happened to him? I can't believe you talked me into this. I need to check out the med station. I'll be out in 3 minutes. Here they are! Hurry. Let's get out of here. Why are we doing this? I'll send the pills to a friend who works at the university hospital. I figured whoever's doing this is on the wrong medication. Look, Carl was ready to go home. According to Grace, he was on a huge dose of tranquilizers. He shouldn't have been able to get out of bed... much less hang himself. What? You're cute when you're sleuthing. Good night. Good night. Sara? There is no place like home. If Franks finds out we're in his office, we're screwed. It was a little boy. I've been seeing him since I got here. At first I thought it was one of the gardener's kids. - What? You're sure he isn't? - No way. Look... I know this sounds strange. But I think this place actually might be haunted. I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it myself. But I think Alice saw something, and Franks, too. Why else would he have these books? What? It's just between your theories on the medication, and Franks. Now you're seeing ghosts? Maybe your surroundings are affecting you. I'm not crazy, Sara. He was right outside my window. He looked right at me. - Believe me. - Okay, okay, I do. Where do they keep the patient records? The nurses' station. - Come on. - Get your hands off me! I didn't kill that bitch! There's something you ought to understand. Nothing goes on here that I don't know or hear about. Then you know that I'll be back for you. And you, snitch! You're next. I'm going to skin you alive! Nobody's safe here! - Muzzle him. - Nobody's safe! That poor, troubled boy. I heard he was raised in a carnival. Now we know where the narcotics disappeared to. What happened? They're questioning him regarding Nurse Hendricks' death. Franks found her taser in his things. They also found out he had relations with a patient. Who are you? Clark, you're there? I'm sorry, yes, this is he. This is Tom, from the lab. Hi, Tom. There is no narcotics in the drugs that you gave me. - What? - Just placebos. All right. Thank you for looking into that. You were right about the medication. The Risperdex they dispense here is just a placebo. Taking matters into our own hands? Very aggressive. I'll call the board first thing Monday morning. One patient is going into psychoses... and acting out because he's not getting his meds. I wouldn't tell anyone about our discovery until then. You wouldn't want Franks to cover up their dirty work. They arrested Drake today... and I don't think he did it. I heard Hendricks arguing with Franks the day she died. I think he's connected and she knew about it. They say the obvious answer usually is the answer. It's in front of your eyes. You have to be willing to see it. How do you know about everything going on here? I'm smart. Be honest with me. Can you get out of this cell? Let me go out, too! Why do you get out and I don't? Only in my mind, Royce. Only in my mind. Tell me about the ghost of the little boy. He's showing up everywhere now. He must be fond of you. You've got work to do. You'd better get back upstairs before you miss any more action. Admittance, diagnosis, release dates. Here's everything you need. This is amazing. Great job. Check this out. Here are patients that were rehabbed and released... since Franks took over. - How many? - None. None? This is unbelievable. This proves that he keeps patients sick so they can't go home. Ben London. Cell 44, schizophrenic, died in 1989? - So? - So he's not dead. I talked to him this morning. You're losing me. Dr. Morton told me about a patient who escaped from cell 44 years ago. Maybe Ben was the one who escaped. And Franks tried to cover it up by... saying he died. When they got around to catching and bringing him back... They never bothered to take him off the deceased list. Exactly. What are you thinking? I don't know. You have to be thinking about something. You can tell me. We're in this together. Perfect. Kitchen's closed! Let me see... peaches... gravy, pudding... meatloaf! Just what the doctor ordered. Pickles? Pickles. Ketchup. Ketchup, ketchup, ketchup, ketchup, ketchup. Got you! - Who are you? - It's Clark. What did you do to me? Where am I? What's happening to me? It's okay. Sara, look at me. I work with you at the hospital. Do you remember? Look, I think you forgot to take your medication. Take a couple of these and it will be better. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I just can't figure out... what's real and what's a dream. Come on. Come here. All right. ...coming to the area late today... bringing along chances of thunderstorm and low temperatures. And now, for more informations on our top story... lets go back to Peter Garcia. Sheriff Johnson warns that the escaped suspect... who was detained on suspicion of murder... should be considered armed and dangerous. He's known to go by the alias of Drake Anderson. Anderson is 5 foot 10, has dark brown hair... and sports the tattoo of a spider on his neck. Anyone with information leading to his capture... should report it to the Kirkside Sheriff's Department. - What happened? - Thank God you're okay. - Someone killed Dr. Morton. - What? I'm scared. I don't know who to trust anymore. - Drake got out. - What? I heard it on the radio. He escaped last night. If it was him, then he's probably long gone. They searched this whole place with a fine-tooth comb. That investigator wants to ask us a few questions. Not now. I'm going to talk to Franks. - What? - I'm going to talk to Franks! Open the goddamn door! Franks, I know you're in there! Open the door! Jesus! - It isn't Drake. - What are you talking about? I asked the cops and they said he was arrested 20 minutes ago. - He stole a car in Dallas. - I'm leaving. Wait, wait. I don't know what's going on here. Come with me if you want, but I'm not staying. Okay. Okay. Wait, I'll go. Come with me to the office and I'll grab a few things. Come on. I want to be sure security... can keep the patients locked down. They won't be safe here. Nobody will be safe here. I'll tell Betty we're going. Fine. But make it quick. I want to get as far away as possible. I will. We'll be okay. Nothing will happen with all those cops hanging outside. Here. What if it's not a person doing all this? - What do you mean? - What if it's like Morton said? What if something happened in the building... and it's never forgotten? Clark... it was a person. And if it was a patient, they're all in lockdown. We're fine. Now go back. I'll just finish up around here. - It's right in front of your eyes. - Clark, are you there? Right in front of your eyes. I just can't figure out... what's real and what's a dream. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Sara. Thanks for your help, Officer. Also, I have a list of patients. I'll leave it in a red folder in my outbox. Not a problem. You have my cell number. Okay, all right, thank you. Why did you drug me? I just gave you a calmative. You were acting really strange. It was you. I should've figured it out the other night when you had... your relapse. You're wrong. Ben told me the answer was right in front of my eyes. - Who? - Cell 44. Ben London. He must have seen you the night you killed Nurse Hendricks. That's why he told me the answer was right in front of my eyes. There's no one in cell 44. - Don't lie to me. - It's used for storage. You were the one who told me... never to trust a schizo. I can prove he's there. There you are. I've been looking for you. Is something wrong? Ben! Ben! Ben, what's going on? Why didn't you tell me it was Sara? I'm going to let you out of here. So you can get someplace safe. But I want to see your face. I suppose it's time to go home. That kid I keep seeing running around the halls? It's a little strange that he runs around here at night. Maybe your surroundings are starting to affect you. I'm not crazy, Sara. Now you know what madness feels like. That's a feeling you'll never forget. Hey, good looking. We've got work to do. Boys are not toys, Les! He was the sickest patient that I ever come across. There you are. I've been looking for you. You need to teach you some respect! What I'd love to do is change this place for the better. That's really why I came here. Betty, go to one. Have my car sent around. Where are my keys to the medication? Never mind. 'This letter is in regards... to the tuition fees for Clark Stevens' internship. Since his unfortunate death... we'd like to arrange a refund of payment. Please contact the administration office.' 'Ben London, diagnosed... with chronic multiple personality disorder... escaped January 8, 1989.' - Hi, Dr. Franks. - You! Clark, have you lost your mind? It's Ben! - It's Ben London! - Ben London. Do you remember me, Al? That little boy? The one that you and Hendricks... and all the others never once tried to help. Ben London. Listen, I can help you. It's too late for that now! Help! Hello? I'm at Cunningham Hall. I'm in the basement. There are cops outside. Help me! Come on, Sara. You're as screwed up as I am. We belong together. Come on, darling. Get up out of the corner. You're making me crazy. - I didn't do anything. - I know. It's just that... I came back to this place... to get rid of memories I had here. Unfortunately, you're now one of them. But I'm just like you. I'm so sorry... but I can't leave any loose ends. Ben, I can protect you. I found your file. I took it... and I'm keeping it safe for you. Where? We can both go away. They won't even know you were here. Clark. Clark's not here, anymore. Clark doesn't even exist.
