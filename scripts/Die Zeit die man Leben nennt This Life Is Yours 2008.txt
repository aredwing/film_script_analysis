He gave of his best, he said. And he expected me to do so as well. Until the day my life changed completely. This Life Is Yours If you look at a single minute, what is it, really? Just a small bit of time. An hour has sixty, a day 1440 minutes. So when I was 22, I had already lived for 11 million... And then, according to the unknown plan of God, or Fate... one second was picked from my life's timetable. And that second became more important than the millions of minutes before. Is Jargonov really here? He made me fail in Prague. Good evening. Welcome to this year's International Piano Contest, in this wonderful hall. As our first pianist I invite Yuri Kovacs to the stage. He'll play Liszt's Sonata in B Minor. He's a monster. A precision machine without feeling. I just heard that Yuri Kovacs wants to play another piece. He'll play Beethoven. - He plays Beethoven? The second movement of Sonata Number 13 in E Flat Major, Opus 27. He's playing your piece. This is outrageous. He does it on purpose, the rat. In Prague, when I dropped out. Remember what you said? You can lose, but you can never give up. And now we invite Luca Behrendt to the stage. Whatever he plays, it'll be better. He can do it. Once more, we invite Luca Behrendt to the stage. What will he do? I see Luca will play the same piece we've just heard from Yuri Kovacs... Playing the same piece twice is pointless. Luca will play the Third Movement of Sonata 17 in D Minor... Opus 31, number 2. Please go ahead. How much time do they need? Ladies and gentlemen, dear competitors, it's the end of our contest. I hope you enjoyed it. - I'm flipping here. It's a pleasure for me to announce tonight's winners. In third place, we have Felix Lundquist from Sweden. Good decision. Jargonov has excellent taste. We invite the artist to the stage. In second place, we have a superlative Beethoven interpreter. We invite Yuri Kovacs to the stage. And the first prize of the International Piano Contest goes to... Luca Behrendt. You won't mind if I don't come along? - Of course not. You have to be fit, tomorrow. But I'm not worried, you can do it. And thank you. It brought me luck. And now it has to bring you luck. Kuballa has reserved a table at the Austernkeller. Jaronov's coming too. Calm down, Mom. Time to relax. More mail for you. Do you know you get the most mail of everyone here? It's a beautiful day. A bit of sunshine for you. Hello, Lynn. Can I come in? I'm so sorry. I know what you're going through. I'd give anything to undo what's happened. It's too late. His life is ruined. And mine as well. Don't say that. We'll pull through together. Together? That would be a change. He's my son too. I don't see him as often, but I do love him. That's why you came to his concerts so often, right? I can understand you're hurt. But reproaches don't help. - Your presence might have helped. Tell me where you were, when he needed you. When he gave his first concert. When he graduated high school. But now... What were you thinking of doing now? I think you liked it when I withdrew from your life. But that's not the point now. I've been trying to reach Luca for weeks. But he won't let me near him. I respected that. Until now. Please talk to him, Lynn. He's always listened to you. There's so much I want to tell him. I don't want him to think I'm intruding. Give it to me. Wait a minute. Don't you understand German? Come on. That was my ball. I hear Yuri plays Rachmaninov now, and wants him in his repertoire. But... I know, I know. He doesn't get as many offers as we thought. The CD isn't selling well. - Yuri isn't Luca. He's an intellectual. It's all cerebral. The feeling is missing. The audience can tell. He played like a dream. Unforgettably, actually. Who, Yuri? - Luca. It wasn't empty, self-loving virtuosity, like with... It was a very sensitive, mature interpretation at the highest level. How is he? I never hear about him. - He's retreated completely. He's in a rehab clinic near Salzburg, and won't see anyone. I wanted to visit him, but his mother said no. I sent flowers. Flowers. I have to go. - The accident. It was terrible. We can't abandon him now. Roderick. Come on, people. Look at this mess. Can you clean it up? This isn't a pigsty. Where's Luca? - Stretching his legs before a concert. If everything worked like your mouth... - They'd hit me. But I'm lucky, you don't hurt a cripple. Can't you be nicer to him? You know what it's like. It's not our fault. He thinks he's better than us, just because he plays piano. Used to play piano. Come on, move your ass, you spazz. There he is. Oh, shit. There's going to be trouble. Come on, guys, faster. Go on, help him. Rod. Pull him up. Give me a hand. Pull him out. Everything will be alright. He must learn to accept his situation. Start a new, normal life as soon as possible. My son has never led a normal life. That's why it's important our son begins one, soon. We have to get him interested. He needed his legs for everything he did in the past. Life doesn't depend on two legs. - Easy to say, if you can still move them. Maybe he'll recover. You can't give up hope, right? No, but you shouldn't fool yourself either. Do you see this spot? This vertebra has shifted, putting strain on the spinal cord. That means the damage to the thoracic vertebrae... causes a permanent paraplegic paralysis. Of course we can build up some muscles. But he'll always be confined to a wheelchair. We live on the sixth floor, without an elevator. The main thing is getting him out of his depression. I think I have an idea. We're closed. Leave me alone. Open up, I don't have all day. I can't, my wheelchair has a flat. You're getting on my nerves. What is it? - You're moving. I'm going to the nuthouse after all? - The world isn't that good to me. It looks like the time of single rooms is over. I could croak any day, you know. - Is that a promise? I'm very ill. Terminally ill, so to speak. But you don't take care of yourself. Hey, leave Sandy alone. She hates it when greasy fingers touch her. Get out of my room, or... - Or? A pigsty, in here. Dr. Frankenstein, want some lifeless bones? My legs are for sale. Your results are terrible, as you know. Alcohol and nicotine are poison. Act normal. I'm not normal. They're moving me. We need your room. - But why mine? It's an emergency, and you have the only single room left. Half a guy can't have a whole room. Can I room with a girl? You have a chance to do some good, after bugging us for so long. I'm depending on you. Someone should do me some good, silly cow. Your new home. Neat, like a girl's room. It smells like one too. Nothing can keep me here, Flo. Nothing but a trained nurse, that is. This is a mistake. I only dived in to avoid trouble. If I hadn't saved you, you'd have drowned. What's he doing here? - He can actually talk. No way am I minding this mother's boy. It's not up to me. It was decided upstairs. - By God Himself? From above Put him in another room. Or better yet, a cage. Shut up. And this box is taboo, you hear me? You'll manage, I know you will. Have a nice day. Unbelievable. Rooming with the biggest bore. They don't care if it gives me mental problems too. I'll tell Dr. Assaro that losing my single room is hazardous to my health. Yes, what is it now? Hello. Who do we have here? I'm looking for Luca Behrendt. Hey, mother's boy. You have a visitor. Josephine. Hi, I'm Roderick Stark. That means strong, you know. That's nice. - Let's move to the park. Sure, moving. I'd like to see you move your legs. Yes, just get out of here. You're much prettier. No, really. Yes, I'm getting in the mood as well. I hope you're not mad at me for just showing up. But I've tried to reach you for six weeks. I've written to you so often. Did you get the letters? You shouldn't have come. It's not like before. I understand how you feel. And that you need time. But I came to tell you I'm there for you. No matter what happened, or will happen. There's no point. - We can still see each other. We were always there for each other. - We can't do anything, okay? You have your life, and I have mine. If you really want to help me... just leave me alone. You have physiotherapy in five minutes. - Why? I've left the NBA. That's not funny. You do the therapy or it's goodbye. Goodbye? Orders from Dr. Assaro. If you don't join the program, she has to let you go. That would be a pity. - Is that what she says? And she's the boss around here. I'm depending on you. Roderick, Roderick, walking is your famous trick. Watch your feet. Further apart. It was nice, baby. - If that works, we can speed up. Other things still work as well. - Sure. Feet apart. Come on. The feet. Yes, that's good. Prince Valium, welcome to the Spazz Fitness Club. That's here. One more minute. - Then I'll be in Rome, right? I'm Mike. - Spelled with Al. Let's start with the treadmill. - What's the point? It keeps the muscles elastic, improves circulation and gives you strength. So you won't grow crooked. - Better crooked than black. A handicap isn't enough? You have to act like that? You're handicapped too. Get used to it. Thanks a lot, Black Mamba. Hi there, spazz. God, this makes me puke. - Do it in your part of the room. You're really mental. - The analyst has spoken. You're not allowed to smoke in your room. Are you going to stop me, wise ass? The maestro plays piano. Or tries to. And no one shows up. An original concert. Bye. Asshole. - I didn't know you were expecting me. I hope I'm not disturbing you. I know you don't want to see anyone. Your mom says so every day. Were you about to play? I'm sorry to hear it. I... Playing the piano is for sissies, right? I've never said that. But you were thinking it. That's not true. I think we should talk. So many things have gone wrong in the past. You ignored me for ten years. Don't start caring now I'm in a wheelchair. Good evening. So, anything going on tonight? - Sure. I'm sorry, Luca. I know I'm an asshole sometimes. I know talking isn't your thing, but you could say something now. I said I'm an asshole sometimes. - Sometimes? Always. Yes, but not on purpose. I don't know why I bug people. Maybe because I hate my situation. And because I'm an asshole. Come on, listen to me. We're giving a party, and we'd like it if... I'm not in the mood. - How do you know? You've never tried. Don't be a bore. Just saddle the ponies and follow me. The coast is clear. Stay close to me. Many cripples got lost here, never to be seen again. You can have a look around. My friends call me Rod. Short for Roderick. Not Red, that would be... Anyway, let's have a drink. What is this stuff? Ethanol. Medicinal alcohol. So it can't be bad for you. Are you trying to kill me? Once the pain goes away, you'll feel blissful. It goes right to your brain. Make room, okay. Does Assaro know about this? - Are you nuts? She'd put an end to it right away. You should be glad I brought you here. Is it far? This is insane. Why are we in the middle of the road? What can happen? Lightning never strikes the same place twice. Do we roll all the way to Salzburg? - Stop moaning. Be glad you don't have to walk. - I'd rather walk. Nothing. Come on, let's have a race. That's great. Struggling to get here, only to be sent home by a doorman. You think we have the wrong tires? Moni, this is Luca, Luca, this is Moni. Can you take me in? - Jump on the passenger seat. Even though you only have one horsepower, you go like mad. There's more that reminds you of a horse. - You're so cool. Look out, please. The cripples are coming. Look out for my bad legs. - Rod, how are you? You've brought backup? - They're with me. Be nice to him, he's in a wheelchair. - You're crazy. Is this a disco or a meeting for invalids? Sorry buddy, paraplegics only. Hurry up and jump off a bridge. So, do you like it here? Oh well, Rod dragged me in here. I don't know where he gets the strength. He's really tough, isn't he? I'm sorry. I'd forgotten that you're also... That spazz can't dance. Come here, give me a kiss. Something's leaking. - I think your catheter has emptied. I should have drunk vodka instead of beer, right? This happened to me before I was crippled too. Another kiss. You smell. - Let Moni decide that. I'm going to dance again. - Beat it. Phew. Move over, you smell like a brewery. Moni had the hots for you. - Oh, come on. We can forget about women. - Why? There are other ways, besides sticking it in. And mine is always up. At least we're not guys who kiss and run. You don't need to take stock of everything we're not. Your frustration is putting me in a bad mood Is it still far? - Yes. Clean up the urine, and the tire tracks on the walls. No rowdiness at six in the morning, waking up fellow patients. Could you keep it down? At least turn down the treble. And leaving the clinic at night is forbidden. He shouldn't drink. It's poison to him. - Poison, absolutely. Go to dialysis. I'd prefer a massage parlor with Thai chicks. You're making good progress. If that continues, you can go home in a few weeks. Home, where's that? So here you are. I've searched the entire building for you. How are you? You look fine. How's the music going? - Music? I seem to recall you're a pianist. A pretty fair one, too. May I? It's nice here. Far from the pressure to perform, the struggle and competition. You need these creative breaks. They clear the head, and the heart as well. Still, it's time to get started again. Get started again? I'm not playing anymore. Not playing anymore? What do you mean? What I said. I'm not playing anymore. - Why not? Your hands are okay, there are many pieces you can play without pedals. Bach. He's part of your repertoire. Your accident changed your life, and I understand it's hard to get over the blow. But to the music, it's irrelevant. The music is in your soul, not in your legs. Beethoven composed his 9th when he was deaf. And he conducted it as well. He read the words from the singers' lips, to find his place. He had to press his ears to the piano... to check his composition, using the resonance of the sound. In the face of an iron will, his deafness became meaningless. Humility, young man. You have received one of God's greatest gifts. Do something with it. The guys are organizing a birthday party for you. That's music to your ears, right? What's wrong? Birthday present from my parents. Every year. It's easier than coming by, showing your stupid face. I wanted to get a house with the first check. But me, alone... Who'd live with a cripple? At first, they visited me now and then. Julia too. , Then she said she couldn't take it anymore. She felt terrible. That's the way it is. She was a great woman. Legs up to her ass, and back. And they had these tiny hairs, that shimmered in the sun. With her, it wasn't just about sex. That was part of it, sure... but it was about feelings as well. Be glad you'll be out of here soon. You're right, we have a shitty life. We're at the bottom of the chain. You shouldn't say that. - Yes, I should. Look. I need you. - Stop blathering. I'm serious. Without you, I wouldn't be here anymore. Give me one reason to carry on. We have to carry on until we find out what the point of all this is. As shitty as it is, we're going to pull through together. So what about that birthday party? No, that's much too dull. I have a better idea. Your apple juice, boys. - Apple juice? Drink it slowly, or you'll be legless. Excuse me, this is a mistake. - No alcohol, that's the deal. I just wanted to ask for ice. Excuse me. You danced so beautifully. I paid a lot. You should dance. Or I'll just do it with you, that's okay too. Hello, sweetheart. I'm Scarlett. - It's my friend's birthday. I've brought you something. - It's your birthday? Three apples on a wall. One is taken away. How many are left? Two? - You clever little darling. We're going to have fun together. Will you show me your girl's room? Come along. Don't be a bore. Saddle the ponies. Later, okay? - No, right now. That's the deal. Well? Would you like to join me on the bed? It's much cozier. You're my birthday present. My very special present. Why? Because you're probably my last. Sit down next to me, my child. Have a drink. May I? The most beautiful thing there is. Does your friend always have such a good time? What does he do, by the way? He's an artist. An artist? He doesn't look like one. So what do artists look like? - Different. Like you. You're special, somehow. It's up. It's up. - Sure. You smell so nice. Help. We need a doctor. Hurry, it's an emergency. So? Are you feeling better? The doctor thinks I shouldn't buy a longplaying record. The bed will be free again in a few days. - That's what I mean. I don't want to croak here, Luca. Who's talking about dying? I can feel it. My ticker is getting weaker, until it'll stop completely. Why do I have a muscle disease, of all people? Sometimes I tell myself my next life will be better. If there is one. The Buddhists say you start your new life the way you ended the old one. And a hospital isn't really pole position, is it? I want to die where I feel good. What's the matter with Luca? He says he needs a place to live, soon. He wants to move in with Roderick. A young man he met at the clinic. Is he in a wheelchair too? - Yes. So the house must be adapted. Wide doors, no stairs or thresholds It must fit their physical needs. And you, as a contractor, must have the best contacts, right? Financially, it's also something I can't do alone. No problem, I'll be there for you. him I know I've made mistakes. But can't we leave the past behind? For Luca? For Luca. Ah, my brown couch. Put it on the right, please. You, over there. Take that plant outside. Are you gardeners? No, we're nuclear physicists, and we run a drug ring. On minimum wegde I'd like to knock the foulmouth out of his chair. I heard that, Baloo. - What will you do? Run me over? Not a bad idea. You're hard to miss. Oh, oh. A piano, a piano. What's it doing here? - The piano? Grand piano. - Which one of us plays? You or me? I guess neither of you, any time soon. I thought he'd be pleased. - He is. He always looks like that when he's happy. Damn. Why do I miscount all the time? I should have studied law. You'd have been a very pretty lawyer. You. I was about to stop anyway. - No, play it again. Forget the notes. It's good to see you. big closing concert with Yuri Kovacs Come here. Look at this. This Kovacs, who stole your piece, is coming back to Europe. Say something. Compose some text. He's good, he deserves it. - He deserves it? If this is true, you used to be a real crack. The Maniac of the Keys, the Schumacher of Sound, or the... Alright, I know what you're trying to say. Yes, so? What do you mean? He's coming back, giving a big concert, and you'll be there. You don't take it lying down, and leave him the... Glamour and glory? - Fame and cash. And groupies. Chicks go crazy over sentimental noodling. My mother was nuts about Rudi Kleidermann. Who? - Rudi Kleidermann. He wrote songs, for Elise, or something. - Richard Clayderman. That's what I said. Look, you have to play. It's in eight weeks. I can see it now. Luca Behrendt, with DT, is back. Forget it. - What do you mean? Your Rudi Kleidermann has a small advantage over me. That schmaltzy look? We can work on it. He can work the pedals. Pedals? What pedals? What pedals? Hey, Earth to mother's boy. What pedals? What are you doing? - We should get these things to work. We go to the moon, separate Siamese twins. These small pedals can't stop us. We'll show this Kovacs what's what. For the last time, I'm not playing anymore. You're just scared you're not good enough. I don't want to be laughed at, as a handicapped freak. If I could play as well as you... I won't leave anything behind. But you can do something. You know I'm not a sentimental sissy... but if you'd let fly with one of those concerts... Come on in. What a surprise. - Am I disturbing you? No, I'm happy to see you. You look good. Shall we have lunch? - Some other time, perhaps. Not bad. - You like it? It's not quite ready yet. What can I do for you? I can' t explain now, but I have to play at the closing concert. I won the contest, I have the right to play there. I searched the internet to find a solution for the pedals. This way. Maybe it's a stupid idea, and it was a mistake to bother you. But I didn't know what to do. - Not at all. On the contrary. I think it's great. Give me a little time, okay? Sorry, the meeting just went on and on. - No problem. How are you? - Fine, thank you. That's good. And how's Luca? Also fine, thank God. He's made great progress. Glad to hear it. I was always convinced of his talent. That's why I'm here. He'd like to play the closing concert in Salzburg. The concert? How is he going to do that? - The decision wasn't easy for him. That's why it's important we support him. - But how would that work? I thought he was unable to move his legs? A construction is being developed that enables him to work the pedals. A construction? This concert gives him the chance to come back. To pick up where he left off after the accident. A construction. A star pianist in a... That would be sensational. The best way would be sending the signal with the headset. The headset runs on a small battery, for four hours. Is that enough? Biting on the left side activates the left pedal. And biting on the right the right one? - But how will the signal be converted? Pneumatically, I thought. - My thoughts exactly. It could work. Look. The computer's here, and it works. Through this headset. What are you playing? - Just a little piece. I'd like to play it at the concert. - It's beautiful. Is it yours? - Yes, but it's not ready yet. Let's practice a little and impress the world. Not so fast. There's plenty of time. The concert isn't tonight. - Time is a flexible concept. Say something. - Get a doctor. We need an ambulance. Help me. Help me. Somebody call an ambulance. I'm glad you're here. I need your help. Talk some sense into him. He wants to leave. On his own responsibility. But I can't let him. He can hardly breathe, and needs constant medical care. He doesn't want to die in a hospital. - He can't tell how bad it is. I promised him. Alright, then. I'll tell the nurse to explain the important things to you. You've really missed your cripple, haven't you? It's clear who hung those up. That's great, my beauty. Rod, that'll do. Very elegant. Nothing to be ashamed of. Elegant. I hope you'll knock them dead at the concert. They're making such a big noise in the press. And a live broadcast. I'm glad to be back. Ah, vodka and orange. Just what I need now. Only the vodka's missing. I'll retreat to my room, to peruse the Kama Sutra. I'll do my best to keep the noise down. I'll be back for the sundowner. Hello, you two. What's wrong? Why the long face? Kuballa sent me a fax. They've cancelled us. The marketing department is against it. He says... - They don't want a crip in a wheelchair. open air concert with Yuri Kovacs You have to tell him. Everything okay? When do you have to be there? I wanted to... Only you can prove that we won't let them get us down. I'm depending on you. My tuxedo has disappeared. No, it hasn't. it's hanging over there. I had it cleaned, I thought you might need it. Get that notebook, will you? It's for you. It contains everything I've thought about the past few years. Also, I want to tell you right now that I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you too. What is it? The bow tie is missing. - The bow tie? Is that bad? It's not important, really. I was afraid you wanted to bail out, Bambi. Now get out of here. Can I see your tickets? - We're looking for a friend. I can't let you in without a ticket. You can't go in, I said. What's your friend's name? Felix Lundquist. Let him in, my friend, he's one of us. But... - He's the best of us. Come on. I've been waiting for you. Where were you? - You know how many gates there are? Hey, he's done. What are you waiting for? That's why you're here, isn't it? To play. That's Luca Behrendt. What's he doing here? He's not in the program. - He's going to play. He's not listed. It's against protocol. Forget protocol.
