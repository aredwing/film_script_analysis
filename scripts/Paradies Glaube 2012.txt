Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. God bless. Good morning. - Morning. The Mother of God has come to visit you today. Do you know the Mother of God? Yes. - Are you Christian? Catholic? - Yes, uh, no. It doesn't matter, the Mother of God is here and wants to help you. Yes. And she wants us to pray together. Everyone pray! - Everyone pray. Everyone pray: In the name of the Father... In the name... - ... of the Father, good. ... and the Son, - And the Son... and the Holy Spirit. Amen. And the Holy Spirit. Amen. Maria with your child so sweet... Your blessings we do you entreat. And now the Mother of God will bless everyone. This is holy water. Holy water, you know? Now everyone will receive a blessing. And he needs the blessing most of all. I'll leave this with you. That prayer is in here. She can read it and teach you. You can learn some German too. Here are a few prayers and a rosary like the one the Mother of God has. I'll leave this here. You're in charge. It's very important. Hello, God bless. The Mother of God has come to visit you today. Do you have time? - Uh... no. You have to make time for the Mother of God. She has come to welcome you to Austria. - No. Not! No? The Mother of God wants to visit you. The Mother of God just wants to help. - No, do nothing. Bad, do nothing. Please! Go away! The Mother of God is looking for shelter. She wants to help you. - No, no help! She'll help make your life in Austria better. Jesus. You accepted the crown of thorns for us. You are scorned and ridiculed by people every day. Accept my sacrifice today as humble atonement. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. He who sweated blood for us. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners. Now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Jesus, it's so wonderful just to look at you. You're... you're such a handsome man. The most handsome. Your eyes are so loving, so kind, so, so full of light. I... My heart swells so when I am allowed to look at you. Our relationship has made me so happy. I can't even imagine how life was without you. I'm so grateful to you. Grateful that you took me in. That I was allowed to find you. You are like a miracle to me, the greatest miracle of all. I love you, Jesus. The Mother of God will help you change your life. So you can finally take responsibility. - We don't want to change our lives. But you're living in sin. - Who determines what sin is? You're living together without the sacrament of matrimony. Who determines what sin is? - God determines it. He must be very busy, this God. Yes, He is. - God gave us free will. God gave us the free will to decide what's good and evil. And what's right. - God decides what's evil. But man decides whether to choose good or evil! As long as we stick to the Ten Commandments... Right? The Ten Commandments... Then everything's fine. I won't kill or rob anyone. Or cheat anyone. - What's the sixth commandment? But it's from a different time. There were two million... - So the Ten Commandments aren't valid? There were two million people in the world back then! Now there are almost eight billion! In a few years there will be eight billion of us! So what does that say? We need birth control! You're being unchaste. You shall not commit adultery. - It's pleasure! This is permanent adultery. - This isn't adultery. Adultery is when I'm married. And cheat on my wife. - And if you leave your spouse. And live with someone else, that's permanent adultery. No, it's not. No way. - That's your opinion, not mine. That is God's law. - No, it's not. You shall not covet your neighbor's husband or wife. We don't! - But you're both divorced. He has children with another woman. - So what? My wife died. What was I supposed to do? And you are divorced. - So what? Why aren't you with your husband? - Thank God I'm not! He cheated on her. - God forgives every sinner. But only if the sinner repents. Sins? That's ridiculous. - Ridiculous? Yes, ridiculous. - You're insulting God. I don't want to insult Him... - You are. To say sins are ridiculous is very insulting. Who is God? - God sacrificed Himself for our sins. Who says that? He was crucified for us. - Crucified for me? That's ridiculous! He accepted the crown of thorns for you... Why? - He was scourged and crucified. Why? No, really, why? For your sins! - For my sins? Look, he gave us life. He created us. He created us, right? It's so heavy. A long drive for a cat. They hate cars. - He was so upset. Cried the whole way. - Poor thing. So tell me what to do. Let's put the litter box here. You can let it out here. - What, here? It can run around here. - Can we bring him upstairs later? I'll let it out in the yard. - No, he'll run away. Then we'll find another place. - Yes, somewhere warm. Summer vacation at Anna's. Take care, darling. - It will be fine. He'll calm down. - Yes. It'll be fine if we just leave it alone. Come on. It'll be fine. The canned cat food. Don't always give him the same kind. And if he isn't eating, give him a different flavor. If that doesn't work, don't think he's not hungry. I'll put her at the back. Yes, then she can protect him too. You can try hand-feeding him. Make sure he eats something. Dry food? - Whatever. Give him a different flavor, but he has to eat. If he won't calm down, try the Bach flower drops. Give him one dish with a few drops and another dish without. He'll pick the one he wants. Hello. Hello, Daniel. - Hello, Anna Maria! Anna Maria, hello. - God bless. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Jesus, I live for you Jesus, I die for you Jesus, I am yours In life and in death Be merciful unto us Be gracious to us Lead us, O Jesus To your eternal salvation Holy Jesus, we are the Legion of the Sacred Heart prayer group. We are the spearhead of the true faith. We are the Church's assault troop. Heavenly Jesus, we pledge our love. We pledge our obedience. We pledge our devotion unto death. We pledge to make Austria Catholic again. Dear Mother of God, help me convert these people. Why didn't you call? Why call? I wanted to surprise you. Did your family kick you out? No, I just come to you. What would you like to drink? Anything, water or whatever you have. But I can sleep next to you. We're not discussing this now. - Why? I just got here. Why we not start off on good note? Anna, I'm talking to you, please. Please. - Your bed's here and that's final. But I can just sleep with you. Don't I have the right to sleep in the bedroom? What are you doing? - How do you want to lie? Where do you want the pillow? - I said I want to sleep with you. Then I'm putting it here. - Just like that? Why don't we start on a good note? Anna? Two years and, and... You make me sleep here? Jesus, you know how hard it is for me that Nabil's back. But if you want to test me, I'll gladly accept this test. I'll make any sacrifice you ask of me. I love you. Thy will be done, not mine. Rolli! Rolli, where are you? Rolli, look! Your food. Good cat. There you are. It's nice up here, isn't it? You stay here for a while, get some fresh air. Calm down now. Be good! Don't smoke so much! Use an ashtray next time, okay? - All right, thanks. What's this? "Sexual wildness destroys." "Rising early is a virtue." "Your day should begin with prayer." All right... "Only through crises does one grow." Shove your rod in my wet pussy! I love you. I love you. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Holy Mary, give your blessing Bless me, your child So that I may find heaven And also find peace Bless all my thoughts Bless all I do And in your blessing Let me rest day and night And in your blessing Let me rest day and night Who's there? Damn it! Mr. Rupnik? - What do you want? Are you Mr. Rupnik? - Yes, yes. The Mother of God is here to see you! - Who? Who? What? The Mother of God, see! Where will you put the Mother of God in this chaos? There's no space. - I've another room there. Then let's see the other room. Show me where you want to put the Mother of God. Let me think. This is where my mother slept. And when she died, the bed died for me too. Now I just lay my clothes on it. I can't sleep where there used to be a corpse. She... - Because you loved her so much? Yes, maybe subliminally, in my subconscious I feel a certain reluctance to use it. My mother slept here, my father here. - Then let's bless the deceased's bed. Let's say the Lord's Prayer for the deceased. In their blessed memory. - Sure, why not? But first, the Mother of God. - I pray all the time anyway. Look, up here. We can put her next to that candle. - No, it has to be a prominent place. Otherwise it's undignified. Here's the candle I always light on the day my mother died. I always have a candle in here. Oh, there's nothing left. We can put her up here. Do you ever even look up there? Your mother died here in bed. Let's put her by the bed with a candle. - It's too cluttered. But then you can kneel by the bed and also see the Mother of God. Then put her in the middle of the bed. If it's better. - I think so. Do you have a candle? A candle would be nice. They're all gone. Okay, we'll put her in the middle. I'll move the hat. Oh, no. Oh, God. Careful, don't let her fall. Maybe put a pillow... She won't fall. Even if she does, it's soft. I'll put this back. Let's put it away. I'll light it some other time. Then let's kneel down. You mean I should...? To pray for your mother. Don't you ever do that? Sure I... - For the dead. It's important. On All Souls' Day I go to the cemetery. It's very important. Now let's kneel down. Mr. Rupnik, kneel down. - Now, just like that? Of course. Kneel down. - Do we have enough room? I have a few books here. - Then let's move them. Wait, I'll do it. - I can put them over here. I don't want to trouble you. Don't strain yourself. - We'll have to clean up here. You can't throw out my nice suits! I need them to get dressed up when I go to fancy parties. Let's pray. Kneel down now. - You want me to kneel down? It's been ages since I last kneeled. Then easy does it. - My knees hurt when I kneel down. You can do it. - It's unhealthy. It's never unhealthy to do this. Yes, but I'm not used to it. - Just make an effort. I've never done this before. - Turn your shoulder to the right. Just turn it to the right. - Damn, it's hard! That hurts! - You're kneeling crooked. What? - Turn your bottom toward the bed more. So you can kneel straight. - But I have to prop myself up. Or I'll fall over. - I'm propping myself up too. But if you kneel crooked, it hurts. - Ouch, that hurts. Damn. That's enough! I can't do this anymore! Damn, that hurts! That hurts. I'll stand up and just bow instead. That's better. We weren't made to kneel. Quiet! A little reverence now. Try to think of a few words. - How can you kneel like that? A miracle. A miracle. - It's okay if it hurts a little. You can kneel for hours. The only explanation is that women are known to have a layer of fat there. It's because nature made female hormones that way. Women can run around in winter in thin stockings with skirts up to here, and they're not cold. Men can't take that. It's because women have a nice layer of padding all over. Especially on their behind, as you can see on nudist beaches. It really bulges out. It's fleshly temptation. That's what it is. Fleshly temptation. Please, Mr. Rupnik. - It's fat. A layer of fat that women have because of their female hormones. This isn't the right subject to discuss in front of the Mother of God. Yes, quite right. All right then. Let's say the Lord's Prayer for your late mother. Yes... well... Say it with me: In the name of... I usually say it in my own words. - Not the Lord's Prayer. Either you say your own words or the Lord's Prayer. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen, right? Our Father... Don't you know it? - Of course. Our Father who art in heaven, right? Wait... Who art in heaven... Hallowed be thy name. Right? That part isn't so important. Thy kingdom comes to us and thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Very good. What comes next? Now it really gets going. Give us this day our daily bread. - Exactly. I'm always asking God for daily bread. Give us this day our daily bread. And then comes the complicated bit: forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Very interesting. - Indeed. And very important. It's the hardest line in the whole prayer. He'll only forgive us our trespasses if we forgive those who trespass against us. We have to forgive the people who get on our nerves, our enemies. Forgive them! Imagine! But the Lord has to forgive you too, and I'm sure you get on his nerves a lot. But he forgives you anyway. - I've never committed a serious crime. I haven't. I'm a normal citizen. Bless the room his mother died in, and be her intercessor in the hereafter. Thank you, Mother of God. Don't you want to bless the Wandering Madonna too? She doesn't need to be blessed. She blesses you. - I see. I'll leave her here. Two weeks. - Yes, and then I'll pick her up. Who is annoying you? Tell me who it is. Tell me who's bothering you and I'll do what has to be done. I'm going to feed you, sweetie. Just be patient. Have a little patience... Just a second, sweetie. Don't get mad. What are you doing? I feed her. - Are you crazy? That's our food. Are you crazy? Really! - She has to eat too! My cat! - But not our food. She gets enough to eat. - Poor thing hungry. That's unhygienic. Get her off there! Why? She eats just like people! The cat stays in the basement. - Please! Cats better than people! - That's disgusting! Hey, hey. - Look. Then go! I came here with hope. That it's better here. But my wife treats me just like... like waitress on the street. Hate. Hate toward foreigners. At home too. It's no good. It can't work. I can read your thoughts. Your ideology is wrong ideology! Hate creates hate! I came here. I am so nice. And full of love. And hope for a new life. But you not want to change. Forgive him. He knows not what he does. Lord, I belong to you My life is yours too That I might be saved and sing your praise You bestowed it on me Like a father you lead me Along life's paths Toward my destiny Lord, I belong to you... What's wrong with you? I told you I want to watch TV. But it's not good for you. - You say this is bad and that is bad. Is it your business? What do you want me to do? You can read a book. Or listen to the radio. Radio Maria. - You treat me like a child. Don't I know what I want? If I want to watch TV, you say I should read. And when I read a book, you tell me to watch TV. No, I would never say that. - Listen to me. If I want something, then let me do it and don't annoy me. Do you understand? It's not good for you to do bad things. - It's none of your business. And I have to listen to it too. When you watch these bad things, I can hear them in the kitchen. You... I'm warning you. If I say I want the TV, that means I want the TV. Do you understand? I don't want sinful things going on in this house! Do you understand? - Who said it's a sin? I don't know what you think or where you go every day. What do you think? I don't know. What's going on with you? You weren't like this two years ago. - I know what you watch. You always watch very bad programs. - So, you're watching me? Spying on me? Can you please bring the TV, or what? And you always get angry when you watch TV. You get even more aggressive. - Please, you think you're better. I'm so polite to you. Don't make me be rude. I said don't annoy me! I want to watch TV. Let me watch in peace! You weren't this way before. What kind of religion is this? Thank you. Be careful! I'm not hurting you. - No... I can feel... You want to hurt me. Sometimes you're like a little child. No, I'm not little child. Women say men are children, but it's not true. Turn this way. Darling. You know I'm a cripple now, right? Do you realize that or not? It hurts me and I know it hurts you too. You know how I was in bed, yes? Look, Nabil... - You know, right? But now my hands are useless. I can't do anything now. I thank God you had the accident. Do you understand? There's a reason for everything. It gave me back my faith. And you have to understand that. But it also hurts me that I can't... - I know that it hurts you. I can't satisfy you properly. I have to say that. Look, Nabil, try to understand the deeper meaning of all this. Then you'll feel better. You know? - Yes. There's a reason for accidents. It's a test. You have to think about why it happened. What kind of life did you lead? You drank. And went out all the time. I'm happy. - That wasn't a good life. You didn't realize it until it was gone. I'm still happy to be with you. I just wish you had a little time for me. Just a little, I know... I want you to go out too. That's okay. You'd be bored if you had to look at me all day, I know. I have to work. How else can we pay the bills? Yes, I know. That's okay. I just wanted to tell you what my conscience says. It hurts. I know. Really hurts. What hurts? - I just told you! Because I am sick. - But don't let that hurt you. I'm happy it's this way. Don't suffer because of that. I'm just sad that it makes you suffer. That you still don't understand the meaning. That makes me sad. Not that you are paraplegic. It's a gift from God, you know. Dear listeners of Radio Maria, let us now say the Lord's prayer together with our program director Andreas Schatzle. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit... Breakfast alone? No answer. You treat me like a dog. Why you not want to eat breakfast with me? Why aren't you ever satisfied? I do everything for you. - Not everything. I do it because you're sick. I'm happy to do it. But you're never satisfied. No, not always. Others would be happy to have what you have. Really? - And have everything done for them. I give you everything you need. - Like washing my clothes and that? You're never thankful. - That is your duty! You are my wife. You should know that. In all religions you have to do that! I'm happy to do it. - Oh? There are other things you have to do too. They are your duty too. You refuse to understand. There is something called feelings. Feelings. You are my wife. - I can never do anything right. You can do it right if you have feelings. But if you don't have any, there's nothing I can do either. It's something you don't have. To Allah, almighty God, I will pray the four Rakh'a prayers. Allah is great. In the name of Allah, the sublime, the merciful. Allah, God of all words, you shall be praised. You, the sublime, the merciful. Master on the day of judgment. Thee alone we serve, thee alone we ask for mercy. Lead us on the path of righteousness, the path of the merciful, which will not incur your wrath nor lead us astray. You. You! You are cheating on me. Is it true? - Nabil, you're in the way. Go back to the living room. You're lying to me. - We can talk later. Go back in there and let me wash up. You dirty slut. Whore! You are whore like everyone else here! You're cheating on me, right? Stop it! Stop it! Slut! You slut! You whore, like all Austrians! You will pay! You dirty slut! Whore! Heavenly Jesus, we pledge our love. We pledge our obedience. We pledge our devotion unto death. We pledge to make Austria Catholic again. Heavenly Jesus, you are the vulnerable heart that is our salvation. Jesus, I am yours In life and in death Be merciful unto us Be gracious to us What's going on here, Anna Maria? Who are these people? If someone comes over you have to ask me first. I believe in God,... the Father Almighty,... Idiot, I'm talking to you. Lunatics. What are they doing? What are you babbling on about? ... born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried. He descended into hell. The third day he rose from the dead. - Idiots! He ascended into heaven. And sitteth on the right hand of God... - Damn you! You swine! From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen. Let me in. I'll break the door. That's a warning. O sacred Head, now wounded... - I'll count to five! If you don't open up... With grief and shame weighed down. - I'll break the door. One, two... Three... O sacred Head, now wounded... Are you crazy? Let me in! Why all this? Who told you Jesus was crucified? He died 2000 years ago. You have to look for a better religion. You won't listen. What are you doing? You sit on the floor and you beat yourself! Is that a religion? Or are you sadistic? No, masochistic. You are masochistic. For it was my transgression Which brought this woe on thee. - Come out! Whore! Slut! Filthy, dirty...! You rotten bitch! You whore! There we go! Why should I tell you my name? Maybe you're a cop. Who knows? - I'm not a cop. I'm from the church. I just want to give you something. - The church... So innocent! I have something for you. - Beer? No. And you should stop drinking. - How about some vodka? I'm giving you a rosary. Know what this is? - I could give a shit. This is a rosary. If you pray, you won't need beer. No beer, no vodka, no men. - Have some beer... I'll give it to you. Where are you from? - I come by myself. I'm here. - Yes, now you're here. Where is your mother, father? - I don't like you. Too many questions. Why do you care? - We can pray for your old country. Why do you care? Where is your mother who protects you? - Who cares where my mother is? Protect me? - Didn't your mother protect you? My mother fucked 100,000 men. But you have a mother in heaven, look... And she loves you. - Mother... Show me your breasts. I want to see. - No, we're not doing that. That's not proper! No! No! I don't care about you anyway. You can leave. I was a human being in the Soviet Union and now I'm just shit in Austria. Then why did you come here? - A shitty foreigner, cleaning... Whatever. You're more important than that. Dear Mother of God, help us. Pretty skirt... Sexy. - Thanks. No, it's not sexy. - You can seduce lots of men. No? That's not good. - Yes it is! Men let themselves be seduced. - I've had 30. You do unchaste things and are unhappy. How long have you been in Austria? - None of your business! I just want to help you. - To help. Oh, my God. Help! Look, now we spilled it. Your panties smell good. Lemme smell. Come here! Mother of God, please. Please protect me. Calm down. Look, it's empty. Asshole! You don't need that. Put it back. - I love you, my pretty lady. Come on, come on. You don't need that. What an asshole! You want to take my alcohol! You've had enough to drink. Let me have that beer. Can I have it? Will you give me that beer? It's all right. Careful. Careful! I won't do that. - The devil wants that beer, not you. You don't want that beer. You don't. - Please! The Mother of God will help you so you won't need it. You don't need it. Don't be afraid of the devil. You don't need it. Be strong! Be strong. You must be strong... Be strong! - You want to prove something to me? I don't need beer? - Be strong! You can do it. You can do it. Easy does it. That's right... You can do it. - Go piss on yourself! Fuck off, you church whore! - Help us, Mother of God! Mother of God, help us! - Oh, her! That rat! - Mother of God, help us! Easy. It's all right. You don't need a knife. You don't need that. You don't need that. Look at me. Everything is okay. Shit! Come here. Everything is okay... Give it to me. I'll get another one! Keep the beer. Greedy rat! It's okay, you don't need this. It's just water. This is water? Everything's okay. I'll show you okay. Come here! Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. Now I've got you! Everything's okay. Wait! Everything's okay. Dear Lord, everything's okay. Who cares? What you do? Forgive us our sins. And lead all souls into heaven. Especially those most in need of thy mercy. I don't care what you say. You think you're the best! Jesus, help this poor woman. Jesus! She needs your help so much! Forgive me! I'm so sorry. Forgive me. Nearer, my God, to thee Nearer to thee Though like the wanderer The sun gone down Darkness be over me My rest a stone... Anna! Anna Maria! Come on. Up! Come on. Here! Up you go! Come on, help me! Stop it! Stop. Stop. Stop. You're my wife, aren't you? Stop. Stop! Stop. Okay, okay. Okay! Okay, go! Why? Why do you punish me so? Why? I hate you. Oh, how fleeting Oh, how futile Is man's existence! Just as a cloud quick appearing Vanishes when skies are clearing Behold, so too is our existence! Oh, how futile Oh, how fleeting Is man's beauty! Just as a flower soon perishes When enveloped by a cold breeze Behold, so too is our beauty! Oh, how fleeting Oh, how futile Is man's fortune! Just as a ball spins One moment here One moment there Behold, so too is our fortune! Oh, how futile Oh, how fleeting Are mortal treasures! Fire and floods may engulf us Catching us unawares Everything must go to ruin! Oh, how fleeting Oh, how futile Is man's splendor! The pompous man enrobed in purple Who takes his seat like a god Is forgotten in death! Oh, how futile Oh, how fleeting Are mortal endeavors! All the works by man created Vanish and are dissipated Fear thy God and live forever!
