Didn't they have a bigger one!? Sorry. What about the rest? - On Monday. Where's Rizo? - Hangover somewhere. - You need him? I'll call him. I'm completely frozen. Look, I cut myself every time. Hey, what's up guys! - Hey! What's up boss? Move it! That looks good on you. Put it over there. And hurry up with that coffee, I'm dying here. To be or not to be, that is the question. Don't know what to tell you. Who used up all the soap again!? - Check her out... Boss, what about the brains and kidneys? Monday. I'll have some liver. - Coming right up. Stop dragging your feet will you! - Hey, get the potatoes and peppers. Now she wants to stuff her face with liver! I wonder what Rizo saw in her. - Nothing anymore. What's with that coffee? - Hold on a sec! Gaultier, wanna buy some perfume for your boyfriend? How much? - Hundred-fifty. Good God! - Almost a giveaway. Guys, we're pushing the liver today! Man, I'm no magician. You know no one wants any. I know, but it was free. Here's the coffee. - Leave it on. Hey, did you know Tepa punched Nera last night!? He did? - Where? Out front. - Getouta here! - Rizo was there too. Slaps one then the other. - Serves them right. Dado! Liver! Is he OK? I'm on my way! Good afternoon. Your brother broke Hamza's iPhone and beat him up on top of that! Who is Hamza? Mr. Mirsad Melic's son! Who is that? A government minister. Don't play stupid! So? - He'll get a warning pending expulsion! What about Melic's kid? - Your brother started and it's not the first time. As for Hamza, he's a good and well behaved kid. Yeah, he must be, his dad is a minister. Right? Don't be smart! Buy him a new phone and apologize to Mr. Melic because he's very upset! Maybe I should kiss his ass too? I guess I have no choice but to notify child protection services, because I see Nedim is not growing up in a suitable environment. He has 20 unexcused absences and general bad behavior! If this continues I'll expel him from school! That's nothing. You should see what he did to Hamza. Nedim didn't tell you that we tried to reach you several times, we even sent notifications to your home address! So we agree? You have until Wednesday, then I make a call. Come here! - Let go of me! - Let go of you?! Why are you doing this, huh? He started it! Look at that loser. You better wipe your nose! What!? - What "what"? What are you looking at? - Oh, so you're a tough girl!? Look at yourself! Look at what you look like! Wash yourself. You'll go with me and apologise to Melic! He can eat my shit! - And how did you get twenty absences? None of your business! - What do you mean none of my business?! Check your blood sugar level! - I'm fine! Did you check it at all today!? - I told you I'm fine! Go home and get your insulin! Rizo should get you a mirror. - Now! Eat something! Did you hear me?! What're you doing in the ladies' room? Go, sit down. I'm fine here. This is giving me a bad trip. - What is? This opera. Cheeza, I need an iPhone. Well, well, did we win the lottery!? I need it now. - Two grand! No way! - And that's for friends. Is there any way to pay in instalments? We'll see hon, but I doubt it. Let's go people, hungry customers! Fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty-two... What's up kid? I'd need the pay slip... This is good Cheeza. What'd you say? The annual one... for child protection. What's that got to do with me? Boss, should I leave? You'll get it tomorrow. Could you make the amount a bit bigger for my brother? How much is your pay? - Eight-hundred. Well, what more do you want? - Bye, boss! - Bye, beautiful! Take good care of this girl for me. Rizo, I need to ask you something else if it's alright? You don't have to... - Go on, buy Nedim some chocolate. Come on, Eid is near and so is New Years. If you're late again don't bother coming anymore! Sorry boss, I missed the... Don't come anymore! Got it?! What're you looking at?! Who does he think he's talking to?! Boss this, boss that! We'll sort it out. And put on some make up for God's sake. If you're covered it doesn't mean you're dead. Good evening. How are you? - Fine thanks, you? Good, good. Thanks. Salaam! Are you cold? - Don't even mention it; I'd die without this heater! What do you need? - I'll have a kilo of potatoes and a kilo of oranges. Did that boy of mine come today? - Tarik? Since when is he mine? Oh, yes. He grabbed a roll and rushed out. Wait till I grab him. He didn't answer my calls all day. Give me one of those juices he drinks. That's what it's like having a brother. And I'm always worrying about Tarik. That is what they are like! And two rolls. Anything else? Put it on my tab. It's been like this all day! Fetka's kid burned his hand today. Nine and a half. Salaam Alaikum. - Wa Alaikum Salaam. Take one. - No, it's ok. But they're nice. Come visit us again! Dear God, you're such a klutz! How are you neighbor? - Same as yesterday. Let me give you a hand. - Lf you'd be so kind. What's up Nane. Why you don't come over? Take it easy. It's this weather. What's that I hear about Nedim, he had some problems in school? It's nothing. Kid's stuff. Take care my child, that's how they start. And keep on fighting. I fought my whole life, but... Why aren't you answering your phone? Do you hear what I'm saying? - Nope. Why didn't you eat? - I ate. What did you eat? - Kira brought some pie. What's your blood sugar level? - I'm fine. Do you know how much an iPhone costs? No. Well, it's three times my salary. - There you go. And where do you get to every day? - It's my business. Your business?! What do you want anyway? Do you want them to send you back to the orphanage? Or what? God forbid you clean up after yourself. Lift your feet. And the blanket too. I can understand anything, but why get into a fight? He cursed my mother! Did they shoot at the bus? A woman got killed. Is there anything to eat? - Where are you off to? To school. What school, it's Saturday! Really, is today Saturday? I'm going to return a book to a friend. What friend? - You don't know her. Answer the phone when I call! Did you hear me!? Don't be late for work, Rizo needs you. - Hello? Hey, what's up? OK. I'm on my way. Melic returned his steak, he says it's not cooked enough. What's tartar supposed to be like!? Well done? Who's Melic with? I bring you "good news", they're cutting the budget, including the war benefits and all. - They should cut their throats, damn bandits! Well, Melic knows how to save his own ass. Eurosong, IMF, World Bank, fancy schmancy! Where's your off switch? - Just get to work you little faggot. That Melic is a prick! He has an amazing wife and he still screws around! Bastard! You know her Rahima?! - C'mon Gaultier, it's not an elephant. I'd cook it with my left foot by now. What a character! Two chickens, one spicy. Dino, where's Rizo? Why, you wanna pay raise? He's over there... busy sucking up. He still didn't give you that slip? I've been waiting since last Friday. Here you go, love! - Call me love once again and I'll shove it down your throat! Don't make me shove it down your throat! What are you fussing about? - Hey, what's wrong with you guys? Hey neighbor, can I ask a question? How do I get to the beach from here? Straight on. Come on, I'll give you a ride? To the beach? To the beach, any time you want. Well, I can't. I forgot to bring my parasol. Seriously, let me give you a lift? Another time, thanks. Got something to do, eh? Work liberates you. Yeah... from what? From life. For the road. Thank you. Can I help you? Hello Jasna, how are you? Monday's fine. Nedim will be there. I'll bring the papers. Thanks. Bye. You talkin' to me? Talkin' to me? Who do you think you're talkin' to, huh? Talkin' to me? To me? What's up? Wanna see what's up? - Who did you beat up today? - Now you'll see... I'm gonna kick your ass. You'll never beat me. - What kind of stupid course did you pick? You'll see I'll catch up. C'mon, turn that off! Ah, I crashed again. Move this stuff please. - Get out of the way! You're losing anyway. - We'll see about that. Come on, please. Turn it off, lunch is almost ready! - You just don't know how to drive. - You're the one who can't drive! Nane, would you like a multivitamin? No thanks. - Try those tricks somewhere else. We'll play again later, you'll see then. nine Sarajevans were killed and 38 wounded in an enemy mortar attack. Change the channel, please. This we can keep on, huh? Man, check her out. You forgot the salt. She's hot! She'll be hot when they dig her up in two or three hundred years and find silicon instead of bones. I'm eating here! You and your preaching. Change it. What's wrong, headscarf, when you listened to those junkies of yours, that was cool, huh?! - I'm off... - Where are you going? - Home. Come on, one more. - Nane wait, you didn't even eat. I'm not hungry. - Hold on a second. Take this to Kira. - Thank you. - And the playstation? - Bring it over later. Bye. - Come over again. We're cleaning your room today! - Don't bother, I'll do it myself! Yeah, right. How about we sell these slot machines? Yeah, so Kemo will kill us. Finish that and let your sis give you a lesson in "Turismo". You teach me "Turismo?" - Yeah. You think you can beat me? Yeah, if you dare? - Do you dare? Of course I do. - Let's do it right now. Come on. - She thinks she can beat me... Do I have to? I pulled a double shift yesterday. Ok. I'm coming. I have to... I know, go on! We wouldn't want Rizo's business to suffer! Hey Nedo! - What's up. Nothing much. - How about you? Is your sister good to you? - You'll see how good she is! You need some money? - Nope! We're loaded. Hey buddy, you gotta cigarette? Ma'am, spare some change? How are you Ramiz? - I'm fine. What's up with you? Hey orphan. Where you headed? - Catching some sun, huh? What are ya lookin' at? - Whatta ya want? Somethin' funny? - Gotta problem? He can't stand on his own! Hey, Hamza's comin'. Hamza! - Thanks, ol' man. See you later. - See you. We had a problem. - With who? With that orphan shit. - What's up orphan shit? Who's a shit!? - Whatta ya want? Leave it, leave it. - Take it easy. We'll get 'em later. Hello. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. I'm comin'. Want to use this now? - OK. So, how are you? Fine. You? OK. And you? How's your mother? She shit her bed again last night. I felt like killing myself. What can you do? Dino, go get us the star. Mima, what's wrong? Can I help? What a tree! It's taller than the one in the Vatican! Is the perfume gonna be here by the end of the day? Sure thing! But hon, I couldn't get you that iPhone. Where's Rizo, guys? He's over there making some deal. Why don't you ask Vedrana? What's that boss? - Put that there Panties, that's what! - Oh, great! Oh, no. What are you doing, for God's sake? - Why? You should decorate it from top down! Don't you know how to do it? Obviously not. Are you a Catholic or what? I must be, I worked on Christmas, didn't I? Didn't you ever decorate a tree at home? Where were you growing up? In a cave? What's your problem, Vedrana? Seriously, what's with you? And we didn't grow up in a cave, but during the war! Unlike some... We got paid! - Damn New Year, I hate it! Why didn't you tell me Nedim was stealing? I told him to tell you... Today it's you, tomorrow, someone's apartment! He's just a kid. I'll sort it out with him, man to man! Who gave you the right to solve my problems!? You know he's diabetic! You want him to go into a coma? - No wonder that other woman left him. I've taken care of my brother till now and I can do from here on out! What's my tab? Add it all up, please. And I'll have an orange juice and Honey Hearts cookies. - She's coming again? - Yes. No one said you couldn't take care of your brother... Just give the girl what she asked for! Two hundred and twenty. No, it's fine. That's for the stuff he stole. Are you out of your mind?! Where have you been all day? Why don't you answer the phone? - Can I take a leak in peace? Did you wash your hands? Jasna's coming. I told her you'd be home. Well, I'm home. Thanks for the gift. Although I'm not sure it's smart to spend money on things like this in your situation. The neighbors bathroom flooded. Nedim, how's school? - Fine. Nedim, turn around when you talk to Mrs. Jasna! How are your grades? - They're fine. Any other problems? When did you go to his school last? Just the other day. OK. What about the job, you still have it? - I do. Where's your pay slip? I don't have it. My boss wasn't in... That's no excuse. You've known all year you'd need it! Yes, but... - Always a "but". I'll get it. - When, love? The medical reports? This is for October. Where is the rest? Just a moment. Move. Move the chair. Help me find it. Here you are. - What's this? It's for November. We didn't get the one for December because... 'Cos the lady has to work! Dear Rahima, you know he has to see a doctor twice a month! This is very irresponsible of you. I'm afraid I'll have to record this. I need to go to the toilet. Nedim's room is cold. You should get him a heater! We had one, but... - And this handle fell off. It broke... - Oh, what's wrong with this couch? Seems that I'll have to come again. I can give you time until... New Year's is on Thursday and I have to submit the report by Wednesday. So the day after tomorrow. I'll bring everything to your office. I hope it won't be like the last time! How is Enver? - Getting ready to retire. Will you be the new manager? That's that. Goodbye. - Bye Nedim. I had a call from Nedim's school the other day, but I wasn't in the office. Do you know why they called? Probably about the fight, but it wasn't a big deal. Are you sure? - I'm sure. No need to check? - No. He's fine. Ok. I'm glad that he turned out better than you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you so much. The Bosnian economy has been completely devastated primarily because of the war but also due to the global economic crisis. However, most analysts agree that the key reason for this economic devastation has been the criminal privatisation process. Bosnia's pre-war industry was one of the strongest in the region. This is the cry of a hungry people! This is a desperate attempt to open these doors, to enter inside and see what is happening behind them. To see who are these people who take the bread from our mouths. In front of our children. Over there is corruption and crime. They are thieves! As far as we are concerned, the privatisation process is progressing according to plan. And about the number, let me say that the government will insist to stick to what was agreed. But we must be realistic. We will insist that contracts be to our advantage. When do you expect this process to end and what about workers on waiting lists? We are working... Juveniles again. Some fifteen year olds stabbed an old lady in Dobrinja. Where is this world going to? - How's your bro? Why? Want to marry him!? - Well... Look here, a drunk fell down a ditch. I wish my old man would do the same! You know what!? I told that grocer that I'll show him his maker if he sells my husband brandy again. You know what, I'll blow him up with the brandy and the store! How's it going, youngsters? Party time! Mima, a brother's looking for you. Salaam Alaikum sister. - Wa Alaikum Salaam. Where do I put this? - What's that? Chicken wings. Salaam Alaikum. - Bring it over. Nedim? Why are you in bed? What happened? - Nothing, leave me alone! Who beat you? - No one. What do you mean no one? Look at you. Was it Melic's son? No, I don't know. What did you need this for! Of course it's always my fault! - You get what you ask for! No one dared mess with me until you started wearing that headscarf! So it's my fault now? - It is! Why did you have to take me from the orphanage? Well, if it isn't the legendary Mima!? Who beat up my brother? Oh, did someone mess with him? - Yeah, like you don't know what happened. Mima, I have no idea, I swear. Mima!? Hey Coro!? - Mima, is that really you!? I can't believe it. Let's sit and have a coffee. - I can't. Have to run. Why are you here? I had something to do. Man, I can't believe it! Check out my sister! Like a heavenly creature. But you look fine, so help me God. Man, this is my sister, don't let anyone mess with her! I'm sorry but I have to go. Dalila, do you know who beat Nedim up? No idea. Was there trouble at school again? Let me know if you hear something, please. - Sure. - Thank you. Hey, what's wrong? Do you need some help? I know all the big shots in town. - No. Do you have a cigarette? Are you working? In a restaurant. As a cook. Here, take it all. Thanks! That's great! I work for Brando. You know him, right? I do. Excuse me, I have to go. Mima! You gotta ten spot? I left my wallet at home. Do you know how much I love you? You really looked out for me at the orphanage. Here you go. And you should really stop doing that shit. Why don't you have a little break. - Oh my God, it's so hot in here. - Guys! What's the plan for New Year's? What do you mean!? Hawaii, of course! Guys, Melic has a new lady friend! He wants ten sausages in a half bun. - Wow! - He returned the steak, says it's overdone. - I can't believe it! - Let's go guys! Party time! - Dear Lord, you've completely lost it. - Happy New Year! Let's go Daca, mix it up. Let's go. Get wild. You come in here stoned! Spill drinks! Is that it? Trying to chase my customers away!? Why is Melic waiting an hour for his steak! Eh, Davor!? I'll kill you all! What!? - Rizo... - Fuck off! Let's go people, let's go! Sorry, I have no change. - Mr. Melic! Do I know you? - I'm Nedim's sister. Nedim, who? - Nedim, from Hamza's class. Aaa, that orphan. So did you buy the iPhone? I wanted to ask you if you could wait until after the new year? Well, I'm not a charity. But we could make some other arrangement? Listen up asshole, tell that idiot son of yours that if he touches my brother again, you'll be looking for him in the river! Your daughter is waiting! You're in for it now! This is not over! Who was that? - Shut up! Aunt Kira passed away. What happened? - Heart attack. Good evening. - How are you? She was still young. God save us. Such a waste. Death doesn't care if you're young or old. God rest her soul. - May she rest in peace. - This is all because of the war. How are your shrapnel wounds? - Like the weather. And your company? - Shut down. And your company? It's good. Like these times. Ups and downs. How are you Ibro? - I'm good thank God. Is this done? - It is, thanks. Is that her daughter? - The boy's mother. That's what killed her! Good evening. - Good evening. Selma! - Yes? - Make some fresh coffee. - OK. Hi Nedim. - Hello. How are you doing? Don't worry, everything will be fine. How's school? I hear the price of cigarettes will go up? They have to, but not by much. Time to go Nedim. - OK. Nane, see ya. Does anyone want some coffee? Don't bother. I'd like some. - OK, then I will too. Would you like some coffee? It's good he fell asleep. I can't believe that mother of his. She didn't even look at him. Poor kid. What's he going to do now. Why did you start wearing a headscarf? I have crooked legs and loppy ears. You know, I can understand finding faith, I'm religious too, but covering the hair is a bit... Radical? - No, not radical, but... Unnecessary, is it? Not unneccessary, oh I don't know how to put it... Hey, enough politics. Let's have a smoke. We're going to the mosque to pray. Want to come? I'll do it at home. Is there any hot water? Yes... That's a nice headscarf. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings the other day. I like you. And I'm too old to be playing games. I have honest intentions and I wanted... - You realize I come in a package? I know. And I love you just like you are... In a package. So think about it. Who is it? - Police! Just a moment. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Are you Rahima Masic? - I am. Your ID please. Rahima Masic. You're a recidivist. With multiple relapses into criminal behavior. What are you talking about? According to an intelligence report dated December 30th, at 18.45 in a parking garage located at Branilaca Otesa 32 you assaulted a state official, Mr. Mirsad Melic while he was performing his duties. Also, on December 25th, your brother damaged property of the same individual. Do you have anything to say, or do you reserve the right to remain silent? Felony offenses of this nature can include 1-8 years in prison, Halima. You have 24 hours to report to the proper authorities to give a formal statement on this felony offense. Here's your ID. Are we clear? You should also bring proof of ownership for all of this property. That's Kemo's. He owns the flat. I have nothing to do with it. Are you Nedim? What happened to you, Nedim? Nothing. A little fight. You'll turn out better than your sister. Who are these guys? Where were you? What are you looking for? - Insulin. Did you check under the bridge? Where's my stuff? - Where did you get it? - Give it back to me! Who gave it to you? Your pal Brando! Where are you off to? Where are you off to? Happy New Year! Let's go home! Give me your bag. - No need. Give me your bag. Take this one, if you like. Where were you going? To stay with Ramiz? What's wrong with Ramiz? If you only dressed up nicely. Did you eat? - No. - Me neither. I could throw something together. How about some pancakes? - It's been ages since you made any. - Liar, I made some last week! - Maybe you made them for Rizo. - Well, Rizo can eat shit now!
