Senator, don't count your chickens before they hatch. But I believe CONCRISA has already won the competition. THE FALL Ambulatory! Nurse! He's dying! - Someone lift him up. - Tight. More! But he was foolish, wanting romance. Forget it, Zoe! With your delicate stomach, you'll get burned here! War is war. - How about Moreira dos Mares? - Unforgettable! I still can feel her taste. - Relative? - No. - Work accident? - Yeah. Two hours to get there! And just to leave him! - All screwed up. I was amazed. - 15 days to deliver this thing! - And you're amazed? - A man hurt. A man hurt! - Let's stop? - The ambulance took us one hour. And the ambulatory is shit. No-one to serve us! Should've taken him to the hospital. - Why did he fall anyway? - He had no belt. Another guy died like that. Asked me for a belt... ...but couldn't find any! Yet he went up, cause he was a good worker. But without belt, I wouldn't go that high. The engineer Mendes, I talked to him about the schedule. You think we'll finish with this rain? How? Working with 20% of the employees! "I don't care" he says. Well, nobody does! But we had to take the guy to the ambulatory. C'mon, Mario! Hello. Yeah... Right. Okay. - Where is Zoe's locker? - That one. How's he? How's he? Gone. - Play it right. - I know. - Supper, Mario. - It's almost cold, Mario! Coming! Come on, boy! You've gotta eat. - Warm up the macaroni? - No need to. Have some cachae. Warm up. Get there, my child. - It's over... - Already? - So good! Already? - It's over. - Full of drunkards here... - I think there's one left. Get 'em. These boozes are shit. Not smooth. Ya know what they do in Minas? Their booze is yellow. Right? 'Cause they put smoke in it. They put it like this. And then they use a bowl. The drunkard drinks it and finds a different taste... ...thinking it's good booze. The best! Thank you. But his liver...! These beans ain't good. Those from last week were better. I left a tape measure... Did you see it? - No. - Did you, Mario? A Czech tape measure. I think it's in the kitchen. Dad, let me tell you how the money got into the trash bin. How? Money got into the trash bin today! $500 was to pay the bill. I put the change in a green bag... ...but when looked for it, where's the money? I asked Maria, "where's the money?" "Didn't see, Miss Laura. Which money?" Then I remembered the plastic bag! She had thrown it away! Leonel put the bag in his mouth and she thought it was filth! Almost gone! $300! What a mess! - I'll be going. - To the funeral? Yeah. I'll go too. No need to... I'll be right back. - Go with him. - Mario, I'll go with you. Wait a sec. Give this to the widow, she might need it. - Where's Mario? - He left. - Already? - You'll catch him up. He didn't wait for me! I told him to wait! - You'll catch him up. - Shit. Sorry. - What's this? - Give it to the widow. I don't know her. Damn! I said I'd go with him. I asked him to wait, I'd put on a blouse! In my opinion, this is the last chance of BORBA FILHO. - That's true, doctor. - What do we have to lose? Don't know... I think it's too risky. What do you think? Well, at least it'll be a great headache to CONCRISA. But they'll soon find out we're behind all this. - They'll suspect us. - So what? What can they do? Oh, yes they can. They didn't register the worker. We're not to blame. This is too delicate a subject for all of us. What did you decide, dad? All right. Call Dr. Alcindro, I'll talk to him myself. Right. - Yeah. Worker, death, construction site. Do it now. - Now? - Now. Honda, come here. Ah, wait then... Kid, what's your name? Alfredo? Someone bring some hot coffee. Here's a scoop about a worker's death at a construction site. That'll interest the boss. A great scoop. Might be your success. Only one dead, but make it three or four, okay? Make it a great story. My condolences. I'm the lawyer of your husband's company. I brought you something, in this envelope. It's $10,000 in check. Now, you must sign this. - What's this? - The money from the company. - It's $10,000 to the widow. - And this paper? - The receipt. - Blank? I'll type soon. You need a good lawyer. I'll bring you one that deals with work accidents. I'll take care about the honorary. I'll bring in the form. Wait a second. In my town, they also carry the dead... ...and tie the feet too. If the left foot falls, someone in the family will die. Were you there? - Where? - At the church? What'd I do there? - What's with the hurry? - Did anyone talk to you? - Didn't you? - You're happy, huh? Happened just what you wanted to. - You happy, huh, gaucho? - Me? - Don't know why. - Let him be. Drink something. Will you celebrate too? To the law enforcers! Doesn't mean anything. It was an accident. You had bad luck. But that happens. Mario, shut him up. What ya have to do with it? - Me? Nothing. - What are you laughing at, then? Can't I laugh? - No. - Okay. - The police forbid it? - Yeah. - What was the man's name? - Shut up. Shut up! - I'm not laughing, just talking. - Don't talk! - Can't I talk, either? - No! - Can't laugh, can't talk... - Shut your mouth! - Brave one, huh? - Will you stop it? What ya want? The man's dead. - Manuel. - So what? Many deaths are left unnoticed. - How many did you kill? - Many. But now I'm a truck driver. - Let him be, he's a drunk. - Aren't we all? Policemen, truck drivers... all drunks! Or does the police forbid drinking too? - Come one, let's stop drinking! - It's useless! If I want to drink, I drink! Don't nag me. Let him drink. Won't laugh, won't talk, just drink. - Do you know Mario for long? - Yeah. - Did you serve together? - Yes. - Quite a fella? - Yeah. Gee. How he crushed! Gee. Stupidity, Mario. Stupid, stupid... No-one could assist? Something? All stupid. Stupid thing, my gosh. - What, Mario? - Stop smoking in bed. Mario. I'd like to talk. Gosh. Fuck! The administration is getting mad. Shouldn't let the guy come in. What matter will it have? You're asking? Those news guys are troublemakers. He won't find out what others don't already know. Even if he does, do you think he'll say what he pleases? Maybe CONCRISA is acting rightly. Anyway, worker's death is nothing new. I'm still against those reporters in here, they make things up. No-one will leave for no funeral. Who does, I'll discount today. All right, discount if you want to, but not the full day. Three hours is all they need, without losing the right for food. Okay, Mario. But I have 15 days to deliver all this. 15 days! Can't think about no funeral. I have to work to deliver this. - They'll lose the right for food! - We wasted too much time talking. Let's work! Who leaves, I'll discount the day. We're wasting time! I'm doing a survey on security and work accidents. Do you have authorization for doing such a thing? - Yes. - Yeah? - Recorder? - Yep. People see, nobody says. I'll say. Turn it on. People and shit are the same here. What? Workers without helmet? Yesterday, I almost slipped with my soap. Both things are parallel. A moment of distraction. Ma'am, you have the right to pension. Plus some funds. Not much, but it's money the same way. And the 13th salary, the Christmas bonus according to the number of months worked. And insurance for work accidents, equal to ten minimum wages. You said his license was unregistered. So we must prove his association with the construction company... It's simple... Pardon me. I bring my condolences and CONCRISA's. And I'd like to make an appointment to settle everything down. Okay? We have several witnesses, and can make a fuss about his license. About three minimum wages of fine due to the unregistered license. - How much does he have right to actually? - A lot of money. Considering everything... ...it's a lot of money. And we can argue about the company's social responsibility. The carelessness about working conditions. The minimum conditions required by law! The cause of the death was the lack of the belt. How old was he? - 42. - This means he'd work about 30 years more. The amount for the pension is quite high. About... $900,000. Yes, about that. How did he die? Falling from the beam. - Do you work at construction? - If I work at construction? Didn't you always go there? Well, I've found your address... ...on a piece of paper inside the man's wallet. Didn't know you worked with him. I'll tell ya: the way a guy leads his life is usually the way he dies. You're well off. - I did everything after stopped serving. - Yeah? Not nice at all. Like a bum... didn't want anything. I've been watchman, truck driver... car keeper... Met a girl... a hooker. Well off... But she wasn't into it... But suddenly Zoe dies... I find you... - Sounds like a Western! - Indeed! It's moving. - It was too close. You shouldn't... - Shut up. C'mon, you dog... Boy, you seem to be in uniform! Look, look! Just like me, brother. I used this to go to war... No restroom at home? Your lady doesn't like when you piss? I like to be noisy while pissing...! False alarm... Long time no see... I've always been your friend... - Have some coffee. - No, not at your place. - Have some. - Want me to be your habeas corpus...? My place. Come over, fuck. Don't you accept? Nothing like that... I know your wit. Bring a drunk friend home to tell... your wife you were drinking with him. - Up yours! I'm inviting you over... - Go on, sucker... go on... - I'm inviting you over... - Have some coffee. - We'll talk. So long, sucker. We know it's dangerous. But we don't expect our husband to die there. But they do. Like them kids on the railway. - What's this, Mario? - Come. Scumbag. Scumbag. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me! This press campaign must stop! How? There's no possible composition with BORBA FILHO. Don't be naive. And there's the suit against CONCRISA. - We'll fix that. - Soon, or I won't take charge. - Deputy, you're not moving backwards? - Everything was articulated right... ...but I can't involve nothing to put the blame on me. The problem is the trial. And the competition. Solving one, the other is done. Right, deputy? - Right. - Then, the solution is simple. - Just prove the worker wasn't ours. - And his association with us? Responsibility goes to one of our sub-contractors, leaving us clean. But who'll accept such responsibility? - And the interviewee's father-in-law? - What if he refuses? - He can't. Besides, he'll only win. - But we must stop the suit, otherwise... He will. ...you can't see possibilities to elevate a platform... ...making an operation of sorts. Areas here and there... I'm from Ceari! Live here for twenty years. I'm servant. I like it. I enjoy my life as a servant. No, single. Boy, it's rainy and cold. That's what I had to say. Without basis, the crack is immediate. You have to use stakes everywhere. I don't earn much. 3 bucks for hour. Little money. No way to live. - When we'll finish this? - On schedule. ...hot-headed. I'll talk to him. He spoke to the journalist... - But you know them... - This is against the company. Not much to talk... We don't have much to talk about life... Our life is... can't even say anything. I'm from Ceari. - How long here? - Seven years. - Wanna go back? - Oh, we never forget... ...we never forget home. If anyone does... I think it's impossible. Cover those wooden columns with concrete. - That one. - So that's the one. This whole area. $7000. The company men spoke to me, to leave Zoe's payment paper with me. The company has over a thousand workers, I have sixty, eighty. - It'll be easier for him. - But a man wanted to give the widow $10,000... - $10,000 fine. - No, I don't believe it. But she'll get what she deserves. Nice here, huh? These guys know how to live, huh? Say what you will, but these guys know how to live indeed! Mario, who'd guessed I, straight from the country... would have my own penthouse? Who? Mario! Working, you get well off! Did some jobs for CONCRISA, and this is what I get. But I don't want if for me. This is yours. My grandchild's, my daughter's. Look around. Never so many buildings as now. For those who work with it... like us, it's the right time. But don't think about your friends, etc. - Think about now. - But the widow...? The widow will get by. We've gotta think today. And today we're here. This is mine. C'mon. Right? Come here, I'll ask you something. You'll ask the widow to discharge the complaint against CONCRISA. - What you mean? - The juridical dpt. of the company will arrange things. - Who guarantees? - I do. - I do, right? - You do? - Well, don't you trust me anymore? I'm your father-in-law, remember? I guarantee she'll receive everything she deserves. Trust me! I don't know... What do you think, Mario? I think that's the best thing to do... The situation is more or less like this: We both studied the case together, and... ...we've come to an agreement. Considering the circumstances, we think the best thing is... ...we come to conciliation, so we don't waste time with polemics, etc. We must be realistic. Realistic! If we can continue this legal action, we could get... more money, but the time it takes! The time! That's the problem. This could take years, two, three, four. Who knows? The best thing is to find conciliation. So in three or four weeks, you'll have the money. Three, four...? Weeks... So we could have an advance? Just sign the papers and I'm authorized by the company to solve this at once. - It's best to do so, I think. - I agree... Alright, doctor. Mario! How are you? Take in the beers I've brought! - They're friends working with me. - I know. - Get the beer at the van! - Give us some help, will ya? You've brought the beer quickly, huh? - Here it's lacking materials. - No, we're short of time. In a couple of months, I'll have a bedroom and the kitchen ready. I'll get three sand trucks to you... And some fifty sacks of cement. With all that, you can finish this. - How was it yesterday? - Well. - Yeah? - Do you think it'll work out? - It will! I tell you so. The lawyer said you were great. That's what you gotta do, I tell ya. Everything will be fine. Well done, boy! Well done. - Let's eat! - Want some beer? - Beer, Mario? - I'll have it. The lawyers asked him to solve something, and he's doing so. - For our good. - But what is it? Some problem, and the lawyer asked me to talk to him. - Which problem? - Don't meddle! We're both solving this with the company. But I just asked what it was. I don't think it's the time to talk about it. Let's eat! Let's drink! Let's have a party. Not talk about this. I'll explain it. I just asked, never mind it... I wanted to know what happened. - I told you so, it's not the time. - That's not an answer. - Stop talking to me in that tone. - You're saying I have nothing to do with it. If it's a problem for my husband, it's mine too. - Who owns this house? - This house is ours, I mean... Something so irrelevant! I just asked, I have the right to an answer! It's our problem, I have the right to know, don't I? - Laura, don't get upset... - No, who's getting upset?! I just want an answer! - There's no answer! What you mean there's no answer, dad?! Do you think I'm a child?! A "retard"?! I'm not! I demand an answer! I'm not like my mother! - You'll never be! The whole time, you're always deciding everything! What to do, which school the kid will go to, everything! How to live, how not to live, everything you decide! God damn it! Want some beer? I'm calm, I'm calm. But, dad, I've made a question... ...and demand an answer. It's so simple. What was it? What was it?! I demand you to tell me! - What's going on? - That problem with Zoe's death... Mario meddled with it, giving some interviews, troubling the bosses. They talked to me and asked me to fire him. I asked them... Yeah, fire you! I told you yesterday, you don't remember. I told them Marios my responsibility. I talked to him, right? And he asked the widow to discharge the complaint. That's that! That's what I have to tell you, what you want to know. The widow will disgorge the complaint. Everything will be okay for us... ...the company, you, my grandson, everybody. That's it. Okay? You're an Almighty! Solved all of the world's problems. All of it! We'll talk about it at home, Laura. The people... - What do I care about the people?! If they don't wanna listen, go! Fuck! I'm talking about a serious issue, Mario... ...and you just do what Salatiel asks! You're a piece of shit. Did you know that? All he tells you, you do. Even if it's about us. Everything! Even where to place a window! It's always you, you, you, you! Shit. Shit. Could decide something by yourself. I don't give a damn for this house. I don't give a fuck. I want to have my own life... Come and eat, come. Let's eat everyone, he's telling us so. What's that? Chicken? That's it, dad? Wanna beer, Mario? I've been thinking... Those classes you gave me... ...you should give this week again. They changed Zoe's report. He was "run over. " - Changed? What ya mean? - He was run over... - Medical report? - Yeah. - Replaced the accident by running over. - Zoe died there. It's a lie! - I know! - Toinho, come here. - How did Zoe die? - He was soldering, when he fell... ...in the mud. - I know, Mario. I trust you... ...and everyone there. But what matters is the paper. It says... ...he was run over. It's great for us. - Great?! And the widow? The widow... Well, it was denounced in the news that there was bribe... ...'cause he had an accident and now it's said he was run over. Why are you pressuring me for? I'm asking something from the start and you don't answer. - I'm the one who should ask questions! - What's this now? Then tell me! - What ya wanna know? Tell me! Am I afraid to answer you? I'm not afraid of you! - Can I ask? - Ask! - Did you know about the running over? - Yes! They called me, asked to agree with it, and I did so. This will make them win... ...the competition and I get all that paving contract job. I'll be rich! No matter the bullshit you think about me, and what you have in mind. I don't care! - I'm not asking satisfaction... This makes me laugh. I'll tell you something: I always esteemed you, but... you're a son of a bitch. - Shut up! I'm surprised you eat and sleep in the house of a son of a bitch... I work for you. - This house is mine! - You exploited a lot, but not anymore. Leonel's asleep, mind you! Laura, you're watching all this. Aren't you? - Keep your voice down. Keep my voice down? Sorry for your job, too! Make me some coffee, will ya? - Did they come here? - Yes. - Did you sign anything? - They brought some money. - How much? - $10,000. Doesn't matter. Tomorrow morning, I'll get testimony of who saw him dying... ...'cause he wasn't run over! - I don't care. - We'll prove it's a lie... - I don't wanna know. - We'll start it all again. - You can't, Mario. - You have right to a lot! - But I'm tired of all this! Each one tells me something different, I don't want it anymore. - It's not just! - They've come, fooled me... ...each one says something different, even you! So much you asked me to do. Sign here, I'd do. Don't sign, I wouldn't. I'm tired and trust no-one anymore. I'll take my kids and leave. I'm sorry, Lindalva... - Mario, I can't let you in. - Why? - Orders. - What you mean? We see each other... - I know, but you're fired. The man said. - Which man? I'll talk to... - You can't. - Let me in! - Don't make me use force. Each in his place... Out of the way, the flour isn't yours. Shoot the smart ones. They could get the food. Check the load. Hello? Yes, send him in. You're Salatiel's son-in-law? I'm here to talk about the worker's death. He wasn't run over. - Will you have a seat? - The indemnity... ...will you pay or not? - That's with the judicial dept. I can pass a check. - I want a declaration stating... ...the accident was at the site, and you'll pay till the end. - Will you dictate? - You know what should be written. Is that good? What I'd like to know is how did you get this paper? How did you get this signature? - What does it matter? Everything. I can't give this to a judge. He'll ask the same thing I did. How did you get this signature? By coercion? It's invalid! - But this is the truth! - That's not the point. Truth is a philosophical question, not judicial. What I care about... are the parameters of Justice and Law. It's legally invalid. That's the problem. I'm sorry, but in this case I don't think there's anything left to do. I believe man should know the limits of his actions. This paper could create a delicate situation for you. I advise you to get rid of it, get out and give this case up. I'd like to help you, but there's really nothing left to do. Amazing. No way. - How come? - You can't publish. - Alfredo, why not? - The boss forbade the publication... ...of anything related to the matter. - Forbade? Yes. Due to competition. BORBA FILHO and the news. - What? - They're partners. BORBA FILHO and the newspaper? Together? - Find me another paper. - It's useless. It's useless. You know another paper? Take me there. This is document! Document! I know! It's perfect for the news. But I can't. I was instated. - What? - I was instated. Now I have to dance along the rhythm. You know how I feel? I believed in the news, in the scoop. Alfredo, they've shut me up, made the widow sign that paper... ...saying they'd pay! The campaign was annoying them... Let's do it at once! This is document! - What do you want me to do? There's nothing left! - What will you do? - I'm at the paper, I work there! - What's the problem? - Cold. But, President, did we really lose the competition? - Yes. - Dad, may I say something? - Go on. - We just have to prove the report was changed... ...which isn't difficult, and we may still win the competition! That'd be too risky to all of us. CONCRISA would have to answer back... ...and no-one would win. No, we've lost, but keep the heads up in a fight... ...against loyal contenders. - To the signature of the contract! - I never doubted CONCRISA... - What a contract job! - Here's to everyone! Poor BORBA FILHO! Come, Salatiel, come forward. Salatiel, I'm very happy for you. - Is your husband in? - Mario? No. - Where did he run to? - What do you mean? - Is he your husband? - Mario? Yes. - I haven't seen him. Anything happened? - Robbery. - Mario? Robbery? - His colleagues wanted to beat him up. He was soldier, right? - Impossible... A soldier is always a soldier. But now he's being... subversive. - There's nothing here. - This is not good. Not good at all. His father-in-law, your father? - Yes. - He's a nice person... ...well, someday we'll be back, okay? He's not there, really? What's this? You here? All I had left... I couldn't go back. What's going on? Laura, I can't live there anymore. That's what I'm trying to tell. This place isn't ready, but I can't stay there any longer. Mario, why did the police came home looking for you? What's happening? - The police? - Yeah. It's Jose, it isn't just, Laura. It isn't just. He died for nothing. Everything stays the same. I mean... I knew Jose a long time ago, a long time ago. I had a friend, Gaucho, truck driver... Jose killed him. Not sure if willingly, but he left the army, and me too... We didn't look for each other, but met again now. Some time ago, at the site. Then all this happens... We were soldiers together, a long time ago... We were young, loose... A lot happened, we were friends... Don't know... but it's been a long time ago. If I'd die tomorrow, all would be the same... As if I didn't exist. People can't just die like that. It's not just. - 'Morning. - 'Morning. Hot? The sun's coming... - What's ya name? - Joalo. THIS PICTURE WAS FILMED IN RIO DE JANEIRO,
