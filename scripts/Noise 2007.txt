But you will soon, huh? G'day, mate. Hey. Hey, mate, come here. - Come here for a second. - What? Just want to have a quiet chat with you. What have I done now? Fucking hell. Let's just start with keeping the language down, all right, mate? - Now have you got any I.D. on you? - No. What's your name? Fucking what have ID... what was I doing? What's your name, please? Now I'll tell you what I'll do instead. I'm not interested in what you're gonna do, mate.

I'm putting it away. Okay? Now get home. Go on. Idiot. He's gonna be all right. You know, he's crying and upset, And the first thing you police say after his fiancee is dead is, "oh yes, you have a..." you know, owns the gun, take samples, piss and blood and other things, and turn the house inside out, and ask his neighbor if he argue. You don't come to him. You don't come and ask him to his face. You seem all right, But most of police are slack asses. Sorry, mate, just cleaning up some mess. You want anything before I close up? I'm sweet, thanks. - All right. - Good night. - Good night. - Jump in, mate. Sorry. I'm Constable Graham McGahan. I'm Craig Finlay. F-i-n-l-a-y? Yeah. So how can I help you, Craig? Since the whole Fiona frost thing, I've been kind of keeping an eye on certain individuals. Oh, good. Yeah, um... I've been noticing a lot of, like, really suspicious behavior. - Like really suss. - I see. Little things mostly. Things I don't know if I can put my finger on. The fact that no one can be fucked coming here offering you information's pretty fucked, I reckon. And I reckon it says a lot about the quality of person that lives in this area. - It's become a pretty shit area. - Okay. - Don't you reckon? - I wouldn't know. - What, you're not from around here? - No. Oh, we have a very high shithead ratio here now, With all the immigration. A lot of Muslims here now, People that own the newsagent's now, People next door, that Greek cunt you was just talking to. Yugoslavian. No, not that cunt, the cunt that threw the bottle. Either way, I'm gonna ask you not to use that word. Yeah, all right. Sorry. What happened to your face, Craig? Nothing, just got into a fight. What were you fighting about? Some dickhead didn't know what he was talking about. What was he talking about? What were we talking about? What are you here for, do you reckon? So you got into a fight over the murder of Fiona Frost. Yeah, and them people on the train. No one gives a shit anymore, you know? Hmmm. He's going, "was Fiona and the people on the train connected or was it some different cunt?" And blah-de-fucking blah blah blah. No one can get a word in edgewise and I'm like, "right, if you know so much, why don't you go to the cops?" He's like, "fuck that," and I'm like, "no. If it's that big a deal, go to the cops, mate. Tell someone who cares, unless you don't know What the fuck you're talking about, which is probable." And he calls me a cunt, then I say a couple of words and you know... boom. And who was this? I don't know. I didn't think to get a name. You know, now I think I'm an idiot 'cause maybe I should've reported that prick. - Yeah. - You never know. Well, We appreciate your concern. Yeah, of course you do 'cause you're told to say you do. - Well, no. - You don't seem that interested. It's not that... You're not writing anything down. You haven't given me anything to write down. Yeah, I have. Any relevant material. What's that supposed to mean? - Anything that relates... - That's your fucking job. - You have to put two and two together. - I'm not gonna warn you - again about the language. - I came to you in order To fucking insist... fucking assist in your inquiry. - Your language is getting out of control. - People are getting killed. I have to watch what I say? Because you're a cop doesn't mean you can't be called a cunt if you're being one. Call me what you like. I'm not gonna argue with you. I wouldn't. I'm not going to. You're happy just to sit here on your ass, aren't you? Look, all I'm saying, mate, Is that to me it doesn't matter who you are. If you're a cunt in my face, then I'll call you a cunt to yours. You can call me what you like, mate. It's your taxes. I can waste my own time, but I have to 'cause I'm getting paid to sit here and listen to people like you... people who can't think of a better putdown than cunt. What was your name again? Constable McGahan. "Mc" as in McDonald's, Gahan as in: If you can read, it's written right here on my nametag. Do you want to borrow a pen to jot it down? No, I'll commit that to memory. Yeah, give your memory a red-hot go. I'll be interested to see how that goes for you, Craig. Would you like to grab a condom on your way out? So you going away for Christmas, John? Lakes entrance. All right. So when you check into the motel, what name do you give them? Mine. Right yeah. No, of course. Why would I lie about my name? It's a perfectly normal name. No argument there, mate. What are you doing? Looking for my cap. You haven't seen my cap, have you, mate? Phil. This one here is him dressed in a pilot uniform. This one here in a karate uniform. This one here in a handyman uniform. And a picture in a police uniform. Hey! Lucky Phil, stay right there. I was gonna give it back. This is theft of police property. This is a jailable offense. I was gonna give it back. - Where is it now? - Home. I looked after it. That's a pretty bloody stupid thing to do. I'm not stupid. No, I'm not... I'm not saying that you are, I'm just saying It's a pretty... silly thing to do without asking. I'm sorry. - What? - I'm sorry. - Won't happen again though, will it? - No. Well, go on, get it. - Bring it back to my van, all right? - All right. All right. Hey. I couldn't find a plectrum, then I remembered that you had one, remember? I gave you one as a joke 'cause you're so crap at the guitar. Remember? I'm gonna go when I finish this cigarette. I've got my rehearsal. Okay, I'll just... I thought that we'd promised... I thought we said that there wasn't gonna be the regular bullshit and lying. We did. There isn't. I thought that when you moved in, that we'd agreed. We said that we get so much bullshit at work that... Well yeah, now... If you're gonna poke around in my drawers... It's what the police do, Gra. We poke around. I can't make any promises about what you might find then. Sorry. Okay, fine. You're just... You're a snoop, so fuck you. Have you got cancer? - Hmm? - You heard. It's yes or no, Graham. Cancer's not something you get a little bit of. Well, no then. Why have you got all the pamphlets then? Because I've got Tinnitus, But it's like idiopathic at the moment. What the fuck's that supposed to mean? Tinnitus is the ringing in my ears, okay? I know what Tinnitus is, Graham. It means... it means that no one knows why I've got Tinnitus. A reason is maybe a tumor, but I won't have a fucking yes or no until the tests come back and that could be a week or 10 days. So yeah, "Happy fucking Christmas, Graham. You've got cancer." Yay. There you go, Brigid. Sound standing by. Standing by. Hey. Hmm. Yeah, lucky Phil came in. Said he was sorry. That's your Christmas present. What are they doing out there? Someone leaked the ballistics report. So it was the guy from the train? Don't know, maybe. - What happened with Phil? - Nothing. He was pretty upset. - What about the dog? - What about it? It was impersonating a police officer. - What was it thinking? - That's a serious offense, Graham. If that were true, we'd get done. - Yeah, now hang on. - No, look at us, Rhon. No offense but we are doing 5/8ths... Bullshit, Graham, bullshit. Fuck off. You've got the... whatsit, the ear thingy. Come on, I know what's up your bum. Don't let a grabstick Like stouritis get to you. Lionel told me. You could've booked the little shit for disturbance, damage to property, if you're so concerned - about your time sheets. - Look, He was pissed but he had a point. Crap crap crap. He was as full as a state school. I suppose. Don't get me wrong. I mean his fiancee's, you know, dead, so I've got all the sympathy in the world for him, - but if he's just gonna go out and drink... Good day. Good day, Dean. Come in, mate. How are you? Yeah, I'm good. Right, I'm off then. All right, thanks. Thanks for that, Rhon. So, you good? Still a bit hungover, actually. Understandable. Free shot. What's with the news crew? Don't know. Anyway, sorry about last night. Oh, it's okay. It's cool. - I understand. - Understand? No no. Yes. Nothing I've... I've... I mean, I've never been in this situation - where... - Yeah, I know. Yeah. You married? No. - Got a girlfriend? - Mm-hmm. It's funny, when you're engaged... I got around a bit. I never really told her about it. And this one girl in particular never did, so... but it was kind of obvious. I mean, what's really fucked, I mean, I'm supposed to be more upset than anyone and I am. I am. The last time I saw her, we just screamed at each other. There was this guy... or she reckoned there was. And it was obvious it was just to make me jealous. I couldn't even manage that. I'm sort of off the hook though now, aren't I? I can screw around as much as I want now. You're a good listener. What was that town? Up in Queensland? What was the name of the place? You know, little mining town, They had to do DNA on all those blokes, you know? - DNA tests. - Bullshit. No, it's true, mate. They do DNA tests. How do you give your DNA? You don't give it, mate. They just fucking do a test or something for it. What was the fucking name of that town? Hey, Dave, it looks like you've increased your Phil collection up there. Yeah, it's the only way I can get rid of the prick. Expensive bloody habit though. It's cost me five bucks a throw. - No, bullshit. - I bullshit you not. Weipa! That's right. Remember, they raped that fucking girl up there. Hey, Dave, give us a look at that one there, mate. - Which one? - Yeah, that one there. The one with all the tools, yeah. No, that one. Yep ye yep, underneath the Ouzo bottle. Thank you. - Fucking little shit. - What? - Fucking little nuffy shit. - What? All that stuff was taken out of my Ute the day before yesterday. Fucking little cunt. I got this theory about that. There's a lot of research to support this. Anyway, What I read was, The brain keeps working for a few minutes after you're... Yeah, I heard that. So my theory is that... Heaven or hell Is whatever you're thinking then, In those milli- or nanoseconds Between your body dying and your brain dying. That's the eternity everyone's talking about... What you remember. Your life, basically: How you lived it, your regrets, who you loved, who loved you. How you remember, you know, whatever, that's all in there. So if you are a fuckwit... then when you die, in those 10 seconds between your brain dying and your body dying, your brain remembers over and over again all the times you were a fuckwit. And all these endorphins and stuff are released into your system until it feels like this... eternity. You are a fuckknuckle for eternity, and that's hell. But if you weren't an idiot all your life, Then your brain would remember that. Your brain would remember all the occasions where you managed to not be an embarrassment... and that'd be heaven. Could I grab some Winfield blues? It's 11.40, thank you. Phil, come on, mate! I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk to you. You don't go taking people's tools. Got a lighter on you, son? Oh, no no no no! Fuck off! - Fuck off! What do you want? - I want my job back, bitch, And I wanna know what I did to you. - I don't even know... - You don't recognize me now, do you? You did before. You did before at the cop shop. I'm number three, bitch. - Number three. - Oh god. - I'm sorry. - No, shut up. Shut up! I just want you to feel like shit for a tenth of a second, - See what it feels like. - Fuck you. What? See what it feels like? Fuck you! You would shit yourself if you were me, you fucking cunt. Fuck! Oh god! What if he... What if he had a picture of you? What if he knew what your name was? You wanna scare me? Buy a gun. Can you hear that? What? You can't hear that? What? What? Police! Police! Hey, get back here! - Get on the ground! You get down now! - I'm getting down. Are you all right? What have you done, Mattie? Look what you've done! Laddie. Is this it? It's nice. How did you find me? The senior Det that did the interview said "she" when he mentioned the witness. When I signed out... There was only one girl's name in the visitor's book, So, you know. Math. I didn't know what I was there for. I was never charged so... I mean, no one had any idea it had anything, to do with... I mean... if I knew... if it was you on that train then... I'm sorry. I am. I know. Hey, you should probably take this. I'll take the dog. I didn't want to touch it Till you guys got here. First thing in the morning, I'll go to my desk and see a very full explanation as to why this unit wasn't attended. And it better say something more interesting than what I've heard so far, 'cause you and a mate attending to a local you've become friendly with from fuck-or-fight Friday isn't... what I want is a decent explanation as to why this unit wasn't attended. And I want you to think about where the investigation would be if you'd done your job and there'd been someone here like there was supposed to be. Now you fuck off. I'll talk to your super, all right? - Graham, yeah? - Yeah? - You okay? - Mm-hmm. Don't worry about Noel. He's tired and he's a prick. I'm gonna need a written statement that the van was attended until Yep. And I'm gonna need a report on the two arrests - and the shot that you fired. - Mm-hmm. - Attention it to Melanie Ryan. - That's you? Yep, and it's likely to end up on a press release So don't get too creative. So what, now I drive? Oh, Graham! Are you okay? What? What? - It's okay. - What? Just get off me! Just get off me! Get off me for a second! Fuck! What are you doing? Can you just... I can't hear you. I can't hear you! I can't hear a fucking thing. Oh fuck. No, it's all right. It's all right. Okay, I'm not gonna cry. Oh fuck. Fuck! I can't hear anything. Just this fucking noise in my fucking head. It's going... It's all I can hear is that... What? Can't. Oh! No. No! So why'd he give it back to you? 'Course he could've brought it here himself. It's easy enough to get my address if he wants it. There's absolutely no way... No, it's a piece of piss. He's already got my name. It's right there on the photo. All he needs to do is think up some bullshit reason to go to the C.I.B., Like, "my wallet got stolen" or something. Then when they get him to sign in to the visitor's book, He'd see my name and my address there, wouldn't he? You saw me put it in there on the day of the lineup. That's a very unlikely scenario. Right. - It's working. - Shush. It's doing the trick. What is it? It's a "G." "G" for Graham. So what's in your head is the opposite of you. So you know how if your mom takes a picture of you in your uniform, and on the negative the uniform will come out yellow and your skin will look green? Not really but okay. And if you were on her front porch, on her front lawn, it would come out red? - Mmm. - So every color has an opposite. So purple's kind of green, and orange... can't remember. But every note has an opposite. And every sound has a reflection of itself, And they cancel themselves out. Microphones do it. It's called phasing. Well, it works. Works a treat. It's just harmonics, Graham. It's easy. It's really really easy. So that picture, you said it had something written on it? Oh yeah, just some shit. - And it was the girl on the train's? - Yep. - But it's been missing up until now? - Mm-hmm? - So the guy who... - No, we're not going down that... - I would think about it. - No, no thanks. Seriously. Hey. Thanks, Gra. You too. How's Phil? Oh, he's all right. Not great. - Merry Christmas, Graham. - Yeah. Hey, good work last night. Fuck you. Where were you when I needed you? Bloody rollerblades would've come in handy. I don't know about you. I had a bit of a stitch after that run last night. Actually you were... - that was fucking... - Oh yeah, Bit of contact negotiation. Rhonda told me that Rhodes's Ute got trashed last night. Yeah, I thought you'd be upset. You wouldn't know anything about that though, would you? Me? No, wouldn't know anything about that. I went straight home after all that excitement. Yeah, no. I'm just saying that whoever did, Needn't worry, 'cause right now, He's in more trouble than the early settlers. Well, off I fuck. Question. What? What made you do this? What? - Become a cop. - Thinking of signing up, are you? Fuck no. Got some forms here, mate, if you want... No, I mean, you just don't strike me as the sort of bloke. - Thanks a lot. - No, I mean... No. You're right. I'm not. I don't know, I just didn't get the marks in school to do much else. They've got caravans. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Dean. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'll wait outside. You're welcome to fetch yourself some instant. No thanks, mate. Grab a pew. We've had a few visitors today, actually. - I'm Lavinia Smart. - Yeah, I know who you are. I guess you would, wouldn't you? From the photo. Constable McGahan. Got it back this morning. Great. Mel said that it was you that found it? Is she the one with the harelip? She wouldn't tell me what was written on it, though. I did ask her. Twice. Written on it? Oh, there was nothing written on it. Can I smoke in here? No, But everybody does. Do you know what... You want to know what I want right now? I want someone to look me in the eye And say, "don't worry. it's fine if you're shit scared." But no one's actually sat me down and said that, you know? I mean, they keep telling me how brave I've been. I'm not. I've just been... I've been scared... and I don't know if it's ever gonna stop, or if I'm ever not gonna be. Because no one will tell me anything. Dead meat. What? Someone... Someone had spray-painted... "dead meat" on your photo. Am I? No. No, it's bullshit. It means he wants to get caught. - Does he? - Absolutely. There's a lot more chance of us finding him than there is of him finding you. Really? It's not about you. It's about us. He does this to try and scare us. The police. Thank you. I mean, you are full of shit. But thanks. # angels we have heard on high # # sweetly singing o'er the plain # # and the mountains in reply # # echoing their joyous strains # # glo-oooria... # There you are, baby. # in excelsis deo... # All right, come in. Grab a condom. Merry Christmas. So what's the G.O.? You kicking goals, Craig? What was your name again? That commitment to memory idea didn't quite work for you. No, it did. It was, um... Gann or some shit. McGahan. Constable Graham McGahan. Still here though, aren't you? Still sitting here on your ass. Not catching too many crims though, are you? No, not tonight. Tonight I'm watching my girlfriend on "Carols," Though that may not be of interest to you. You don't come across as the "Carols" type. No, I'm into it. - Really? - Yeah, fully. Shit, eh? Saw you getting a few strips torn off you by your boss last night. Pissed myself. - Did you? - Yeah. Easily amused. You think you're hot shit, don't you? No, I don't think I'm hot shit. If I was hot shit, I wouldn't be the clown that ended up sitting in a caravan on Christmas Eve, talking to a... What? Guess. # in excelsis deo # # Glo-ooria... # Bye! #... In excelsis deo. # Thank you very much. Thank you all... Fuck! Thank you very much. Thanks again. Good night. Thank you very much... Ugh! Aw, fuck. Aagh! Fuck. Can you help me, please? Help me, please. I need help. It's all right. It's all right, shhh. Shhh, it's all right. Oh, baby. Pressure... pressurize. All available units, folknap and sunshine. Young Street, Sunshine South. Approximate Melways reference map 53 g11. That is correct. - shots fired, situation is confused. We have a report of an officer down. Officer down, 4-1. Thank you, 18. Officer down, 18. Shh.
