For decades these churches have been home to legions of lost souls seeking some kind of spiritual identify. An identity that has eluded them for most of their lives. Tonight "Hindsight" will take you behind the scenes of the Black Church and the lives of its believers. And you may not believe what you see. We'll be right back after this. "For the the ransom of the Lord shall return "and come to Zion with singing. "With everlasting joy on their heads. "They shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. " Amen. L, even I... He's got hold of us both, man. Well, we could have him killed. We need to talk. Roland, I'm not gonna have this conversation with you in the middle of Dr. Cannon's sermon. Yes, you are. You realize this week marks our 15th year in these same two chairs... 15. It's time for us to make our move now. Patience has never been one of your virtues. We're youth ministers. Youth ministers. Look at our wives. How much longer they expect us to be patient? Barely making ends meet. Hey... shh! I know he can't hear us. Can you for once just have a little faith in God? I can't believe you just said that. When was the last time they let us preach? Excuse me. Uh... You all right? Take over for me. You know I don't preach. One of you boys, come here and take over. Come here, you're coming with me. Taking the Doctor to the room. It's all right, it's all right. - You go ahead. - No, you go. No, come on, man, would you just preach, please? We'll both preach. You first. Man, would you go and take the mic? If I'm just saying, man, it's just time, all right? We're ready. We're ready, L.C... We can do this. Did you see how well we did today? You know what, he's right, Lawrence You guys added some much needed life in that church this morning. Look, we didn't go to bible school for six years so we can sit in the pulpit and watch Dr. Cannon put people to sleep You know, people can hear you, right? Can we just eat? $22,000 a year, Law. Come on, man, seriously, it's time. It's time. Dr. Cannon will retire soon... at some point. And why would he retire? He's raking it in. It's just not right. I mean, look at the time and energy you two put into the church and the youth ministries? Yeah, she's right, she's making a really good point. You guys really have... What's wrong with you? Good! Delicious, have you ever had... This is not the time or place to do this. L.C.! It's never the right time for you, Law. Do you remember the plan? I know, but I'm sure you're gonna remind me. When we graduated from Divinity Southern, we agreed we give ourselves five years at this church. And if we didn't move up we start our own church. It's been 15 years, Law. - 15 years. - And open it with what, Roland? It costs money to open a church. Do you have it... do you? YOU? It says in James 1:3-4. "Knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. " "But let patience have its perfect work. Amen. That you will be complete... lacking nothing. " Okay, well, it says in James, chapter 2, verse 17. "Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. " Patience holds us until we receive what we're believing in God for. You got any more? No, I'm tapped out. Good, 'cause I'm tapped out, too. You make me sick. I'm out of here, man. Come on. Where you going, where you going? You're not staying for dessert? The game starts in about 30 minutes, man. Come on, Cass. - All right. - I'm having dessert. - You got this? - Yeah. I might have two. Bye, hon. - I'll see you, sweetie. - Okay, all right. - See you soon. - Yes. You know, I just wanna go to the ladies room, okay? Why would you put me on the spot like that? What? Lawrence, you even said yourself it's time to leave. I have. But I don't want Roland to dictate my career moves. I don't like when you get in the middle of our debates. It makes me uncomfortable. Uncomfortable? He's your best friend. Casandra, just stop co-signing for him, all right? When it's time for us to leave then we'll be right. Okay, okay. Why do you have to wait for him... You are ready? Excuse me. You think I was as good as L.C.? You were better. It's just that the church always seemed to be more receptive to him. That's because he goes over the top. I mean, it sounds good but... I have no idea what he's saying. You're ready. I think it's time to cash in on Dad's trust fund and open a church. L.C. wants to come along, so be it. And if not, it wasn't meant to be. Now that is minister Roland A. Braxton I know. Kiss me. So the Lord has asked me to start my own ministry. And I will take all the love and knowledge that Dr. Cannon has bestowed upon me and someday try, try to be a beacon of light in the community shining as brightly as Dr. Cannon. Shirley and I will miss you. And we love you, God bless you. Good job. Good luck. Thank you, Dr. Cannon. I'll miss you. It seems like only yesterday since these two men came to this church to serve. Minister Case and Minister Roland are like me and Bishop Redfem. Tighter than that sweater that Brother Joey is wearing. And so it is only fitting that we allow Minister Case to make the final comments. Hallelujah! There comes a time when you have to let go and let God. I don't think y'all heard me. There comes a time when you have to let go and let God. I don't... Amen, I don't think you heard me. There comes a time when you got to let go! And let God. I We gotta let go I I I said come on I I Come on and give me something I I To send him off I I We gotta let Him I I We gotta go I I We gotta do it I I We let Him go I I I love you brother I I I love you brother I r With y'all r I Come on my brother I I We got to get it I I We got to let Him I I We got to get it N We got to get ready We got to let him know He's got a new house to go to. But whenever you ready to come back this house is yours. Amen? Amen! - Okay. - 7:00... 7:30. 7:30. Hey. You were amazing. Well, that was an inappropriate hug, I think. She's just a young woman. Just... Oh, uh, these are my friends. Why did I think she was away, at school? She was, but you know, she's been back for a while now. Okay. Well, I, um, I should go. - You go. - Now. - Tuesday. - Tuesday. My place? Yes, I'll meet you, I'll pick you up. Okay, sweetie. Take care, bye. Hi, honey. You ready to go to lunch? Oh, hi. Hi, Ms. Case, how are you? I'm good, I'm good. We are just... we are really happy that you guys aren't leaving. Oh. Let's go, guys, let's go. Bye, minister. Appreciate the word again, thank you. Bye ladies. Uh, goodbye, ladies. Okay, so... That was rude. How was that rude? Can you just... excuse us for a moment. Sure. All that, all that, all that... that really wasn't cool. I really enjoyed that sermon today. Thank you, sir, thank you very, very much, thank you. - You proud of him? - Yes. We need to talk. Praise God, absolutely, whenever you want, I'm ready. All right. Give me a call whenever you're ready. Ten... no, eight, eight. Yeah, I think this is it. - This is it right here. - Right here? Yeah, this is it. Jesus... you sure? - Oh, wow. - What do you think? Well, I guess we gotta start somewhere. If Dr. Cannon has been here for over 50 years. Even you have to admit, the man was real good. Minister Case, are you kidding? I mean, if anyone should be considered to take over the preaching duties of this church, I believe it should be me. You know, technically, we don't even have to have you in this meeting 'cause you are not a member of this board. Just stop all this nonsense. Brother Wilks, I'm ashamed of you. If Dr. Cannon knew what you were up to he would be hurt. And if Red gets wind of this... you know what, no. I vote for no change. All in favor, raise your hand. Look, as you know... All proceedings of this board shall remain confidential. This meeting is adjourned. You people are standing in the way of progress. If Good morning. Good morning. Thank you so much for being here with us this morning. It's a beautiful day. Good to see all your beautiful faces. And, uh, just very thankful that you are all here to worship with us, and, uh, do God's work. So, uh... And as I said before... These people were not friends of God. No, they weren't, they were... They were frauds. They were fakes. - And... - That's it! They were false prophets. Praise Him... Thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus. Uh-huh. Somebody say, "Amen. " Amen! Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, Pastor. Tell 'em, Pastor. It's like some of the people you work with. They smile in your face, and all the time they trying to take your place. They're the backstabbers. Hallelujah! Ha-ha-ha-ha, hallelujah! Pastor, tell 'em. Tell 'em, Pastor, tell 'em! Y'all don't hear me? Tell 'em, Pastor, tell 'em! Ha-ha, tell 'em, Pastor, tell 'em! I Tell them I I Tell them, Pastor I I Tell them how we need to move in God's favor I I Tell them, tell them, Pastor I Tell them, tell them, Pastor. I Praise God I I Praise God I I Praise... God I I Tell them I Y'all don't hear me? I God wants change I I If you want change I I God wants you to live I If you don't hear me today... I God... wants you to live I But he also wants you to give. I God wants you to live I But he wants you to give. I You gotta give I I In order to live I I You gotta give I I You gotta give I I You gotta give I I You gotta give if you want to live I I You want change I I I'll bring a change I I You want change, I'll bring a change I I Are you sick and tired I I Of listening to the same old sermon I I Are you sick and tired of the same old story? I Are you sick and tired of listening I I To the same old black man killin' the same old black man I I You want a change I I You want a change I I You want a change I I I'll bring you change I I Come on, Pastor Roberts, come and tell them I I Come on, Pastor Roberts I I You finish telling them I I Come on, Pastor Roberts I I You gotta tell them I I You gotta tell them I I You gotta tell them I I You gotta tell them I I You gotta tell them I I You gotta tell them I I You gotta tell them I Praise God, thank you, Jesus. I Praise God tell them Pastor Roberts I I Finish tellin' 'em I I Tell them, Pastor Roberts I I You gotta tell them I I Finish tellin' N If you can stop yelling in the hallway and just tell me what the problem is because I don't know what the prob... Now wait! Just stop. I want something done about this young man. And I want something done now. Look-look-look, let's just stop it. Let me tell you something. If you ever do that to me again, I will hurt you. I swear I will. Let me go! I want him suspended or banished from this church. You need to get your ass kicked, you know that? Now look, let's not overreact. Sit down, please. Again, brothers and sisters, I really don't understand what the problem is. What you did out there was disrespectful, that's the problem. Pastor Roberts, I just got caught up in the spirit of your sermon. Really? I just couldn't contain my enthusiasm. The Holy Spirit is a very powerful thing. We all know that. Wilks, what do you want to do about this? Those people in that church have no idea that there is a problem. Suspension or banishment will send a very clear message that there is a problem. So let's just take those options off the table right now. Instead... why don't we just consider adding a very talented new voice into the mix. Oh. "o. no, no. You mean, allow him to preach? Yes. Oh, crazy. - Out of the question. - Crazy. He's a loose cannon. With all due respect, Doctor. You are losing them out there. Losing them. Hey, look, look, look here. If I was 30 years younger, me and you would go out in the back. 20, 20 years. Me and you. But you're not. You're not. I just wrote these sermons last night and wanted to get your opinion. Okay, I'll look them over. Okay and I'll get your car. Thanks, Joe. Hold on, hold on! Can we, can we, can we table him? Sister Roberts. You look absolutely breathtaking today. How are you doing? I'm fine. What's going on in there? Well, it appears that, uh... Dr. Cannon and your husband and a few others are mad at me. What you did out there was pretty risky. You know how conservative this church is. You just made them all uncomfortable. What about you? What about me? Do I make you uncomfortable. Not in the least. Then maybe we could get together for coffee sometime. You do know I'm a married woman. You do know that I like to drink coffee. I like it black. Lots of sugar. A little bit of cream. If Well, church, it's time to hear your testimonies. Well, uh, I been coming to this church for about, uh, ten years now, Dr. Cannon. And, um... there's no place me and my family would rather be. My problem is my six kids. Yeah, six kids can be a problem. Yes, yes. It's hard to get them to wanna go to church. My kids say church is boring. That's understandable. It's hard to get kids to sit still for a minute. Believe me, I know. But they like it when Pastor Case preaches. They can related. And frankly, so can I. Now I'm open to change. 'Cause change is good, right? So if there's any possibility that he can, uh... speak to us a little more. Well, thank you Sister Jones. Who's next? Brother Randy? Well, I agree with Sister Jones. I'd like to hear a little bit more from Minister Case, too. You call minister L.C. in here. I And more than a conqueror I I Thank God for the blessings I I He calls me to heaven I I Safe in his hands His love for me I I For God's grace and mercy and love N To my brothers and sisters and family of the Greater First Baptist Church. I come to you anonymously today because what I have to say can seriously cause repercussions. Many of you tithe your very last dollar not knowing how you're going to make it to the next paycheck. It's because of you is why I'm coming forth with this information. Some of our leaders of this church have been stealing money from this church for years. While you sleep in your one-bedroom apartment, with five kids, just know that the money you have tithed, to this church, is not going into the church. It is going into the two condos in the Bahamas purchased by Dr. Cannon and Bishop Redfern. There's a time for a change at the Greater First Baptist Church. If That's it. If All right listen, we need to make a decision. Now I feel that Redfern and Cannon should step down immediately. I will not. What you trying to do, Will? Huh? Do you or don't you have a condo in the Bahamas? Now this information is easy to obtain. It probably was a gift. It was sold to me by Reverend Hodges church four years ago. So Redfem, did Reverend Hodges gift you the adjacent unit? I'm not gonna answer that. We don't need to answer any questions about our personal business matters. Why not answer if you got nothing to hide, Dr. Cannon? You have units side by side? Deaconess Carter is ill today. So let us proceed. Now I move that Bishop Redfern and Dr. Cannon be immediately banished from the church. Now of course, they will have the right to file any grievances with the National Baptist Association. You don't have the power to do that. I don't. But the board does. If we do this, who are we gonna get to preach on such short notice? Excuse me. But I'll be taking over those duties. You keep talking like this and Doctor's still in the room. Come on, Roberts, now nobody wanna hear you preach, all right? Is that a fact, Parker? Don't let me start in on you. It says right here in this book. "He who casts the first stone "will not prosper in the valley of death. What in the hell are you... See, see, see, that's what I'm talking about. This guy can't preach. Read the book, Parker. You've never read the book. Can we table who is going to preach until we vote on my proposal? Now all those in favor of banishment raise your hand. Gentlemen, majority rules. Please, you can gather your things. I see what you up to, Wilks. I'm gonna sue you and everyone in this room. - We'll take later. - No! You'll be talking to my attorney. Let's go, Red. No, wait, wait a minute. We built this church. We're just gonna walk out of here just like that, huh? Is that what you think? Talk to me! - Let's go. - No, let me go, let me go, man! 52 years... we built this church. 52 years of blood, sweat and tears. You think we just gonna walk out of here with our tail between our legs like that? Listen, I'm sorry... - Is that what you think? I'm sorry it had to end like this. No-no-no-no-no. It's not the end. This is only the beginning. We will be back! Come on, then. I'll start working on my sermon for Sunday. All of those in favor of Deacon Roberts conducting services on a temporary basis raise your hand. On a temporary basis. Cass? Cass? Cass. Get up. Get your ass up! Sorry. Sorry. You been throwing up again? No, I... You been throwing up again. I can smell it. Sit down. Sit your ass down. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was just... I'm getting a little fat. And I needed to just... a little water... What do you expect me to do? No, no, no-no-no-no-no-no. What you need to do is pray. What you need is to rebuild your faith. You are weak. How could you let Satan back into our home? How could you do that? How could you let Satan back into our house? How could you do that? How could you let Satan back into my house?! How could you do that! I know you like me slim. I just need to get... a couple... I love you. Don't you know that? I love you and I don't want to lose you. No, no, no, no, no. Do you love me? Do you love me more than you love yourself? Do you love me more than you love God? That is your problem. That's your problem. Clean up this, smell like vomit! Get in there, get in the bathtub. Get in the bathtub! Okay. Whoa. What's wrong? Uh, we got problems? What is that? That's all we're getting from the $45,000 trust? $7,000. How do they come up with that number? Apparently there's some... mutual funds that were all tied up and... not doing too well, and after the estate taxes and just handling and legal fees, that's all that's left. That's... this is... only gonna cover two months' rent for the church. That email has everybody rattled. Let's not talk church business. Let's talk about you. What about me? Are you haPPY? Why would you ask me something like that? Your body language with your husband gives away your unhappiness. We have our ups and downs. What about you and your wife? Casandra's a good woman. Albert is a good man. It's... time out with this. I know that meeting here is very inappropriate. I also know that what I'm about to say next is even more inappropriate. But I'm gonna have you. If Really? Really. This connection I have for you, I have never felt for any other woman and that is why I know I am going to have you. It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow or next year. But you will be mine. Well, I don't know if you are medicated or conceited. Or maybe you're just that sure of yourself. I would go with C. Well, I'm flattered... Minister. But if you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, then that's not just an option for me. I hear you. I hear you. If God has blessed us this morning. All right? I'm so encouraged because I see some familiar faces from First Baptist here today. Thank you all so much for coming to be with me. Yes. And to share this wonderful new place of ours, new beginnings. But a lot of Dr. Cannon's philosophies and teachings are still here, so it's a big part of my background. I can't abandon that. He didn't abandon me, right? So happy to see all of you here this morning with your bright faces and your lovely smiles. Many of you know, changes have been made here. Lot of changes are being made here in First Baptist. But just know that the word of God never changes. Yes, the faces have changed. But it's the fiber, uh-huh... Let the church say fiber. Fiber. That makes up this church of change. Now some of y'all are looking at Pastor like you're confused. But I know you know what fiber is. You get it in your oatmeal. You get it in your shredded wheat. Did he say oatmeal! So you see, the fiber... The faith and our resolve makes change... We want Dr. Cannon! No, now, Sister, Sister, do me a favor now. We want Minister L.C. Now hold on, don't be disrespectful. We mad, we mad. This is not time for testimony so I need you to sit down, Sister. No, you sit down! Church, hold on, church, hold on, church. Hold on, church. We are still in God's house. We are still in God's house, now. No, no, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay! It's okay, it's okay. No, we, no-no-no, wait a minute, wait a minute. We are still in God's house. And you're gonna respect God in God's house! I'm still the Pastor in this church. lam still the Pastor of this church. It's time for some real talk. And if you don't wanna hear some real talk, you can go now. I'll wait. That's right. - Amen? Amen. All right, Pastor Roberts, it's gonna be all right. Y'all wanna walk with me? Huh? Y'all wanna walk with me? Y'all wanna walk with me?! Y'all wanna walk with me? You wanna walk? I will take this church to the next level. If you walk with me. You wanna walk with me? Will you walk with me? Will you walk with me? Will you walk with me?! Will you walk with me? Will you walk with me?! Sister Williams, I need you get out of your chair and walk with me. You can do it. You haven't walked in many years. Minister, I can't do it. In the name of mighty God, I need you to get up out of that chair and walk with me. - I can't do it. - Yes, you can. Walk. I need you to walk. Come on. You can walk. You can walk. You can walk. You can walk. You can walk. You can walk. You can walk, come on. Just another step. In the name of the Father and the Holy Ghost. I got you to walk and I want you to walk out that door on the legs that God blessed you with. Hallelujah, hallelujah. You can walk, you can walk. Hallelujah. So how we doing, sweetheart? Um... total offering: $162. Well, then... that's pretty good. Roland, we're not gonna be able to keep the doors open. Well... we've still got some trust fund money left, don't we? No, it's gone. I've already checked with four different banks. We don't quality for a loan. I'll just get another job. Honey, you already have three jobs. It's okay. It's okay, okay? 'Cause it's gonna work itself out. Didn't you see all the people from First Baptist, huh? Casandra told me about, uh, Dr. Cannon and the Bishop. Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty sad. Hon, do you... Do you think we left too soon? No. Listen... What we're doing is God's plan for us, okay? He's gonna see us through it. It's 10:30 at night, where are you going? Church business. Oh, give me 15 minutes, I'll get dressed. You're not going. Who is it this time, L.C.? How old is this one? You're the most pathetic, ungrateful woman I have ever met. All you have to do is be smart, pretty on Sundays, and enjoy the life that I provide for you, and you can't even do that. I don't even know who the shell of a person that's standing in front of me right now. You got the nerve to ask me where I'm going? Question what I am doing? Why don't you just go and throw up or something. Do that. I love you. I know. Does that not mean anything? If If Someone drove up here this morning in a 1997 Buick knowing good damn well that they just purchased a $130,000 BMW 76. You know who you are. So is that necessary to point you out? If you holding out on the church, You holding out on God. If You need help with that? Hey, L.C. Well... we need to talk about expansion. Expansion, what... you wanna add on to this church? It's time for you to be on TV like Creflo or Fred K. Price. Are you serious? Look, you are on that level. It's time for you and me to make some real money for us. And this church. I bought some time on the Divinity Network. You will be broadcasting live this Sunday. You are serious. Are you ready for that? Oh my God, yes, oh my... thank you, Jesus. Thank you. If So God woke me this morning and said, "Pastor Lawrence Case, Jr. I need you to get our message out to more people. " Really, really. Then he said, "You need to be on TV." Seeing that I'm not one to question God's will... Don't question God, no. I'm here to tell you today, brothers and sisters, Don't question. That the First Baptist Church of Christ is going worldwide! I told you I would bring ya! I told you I would bring ya! Amen. Amen! Told you I would take it to the next level. That's good. I'm gonna ask you... New voice here! I'm gonna ask you... What is all this? You mean the TV crew? You know what I mean? You didn't consult me or any of the board members. I am the chair and I made the call, okay? No, it's not okay. You're turning this church into a circus with that... that clown. You're thinking small time. Do you know how much money we about to make? It is not about money. It's about integrity and dignity and respect. When's the last time you cashed the respect check? I'm gonna ask ya! Would you sacrifice your children? Look at the children in here, look at them! Those of you at home, look at your children Look at them! Look at your children. Would you give your child up, your only child up? Would you sacrifice them? Would you? Miss Brown. How old is your baby. She's two months. Two months. Two months. Two months! Whoo, hallelujah, hallelujah! Hallelujah, hallelujah! Hallelujah, hallelujah! Hallelujah, hallelujah, whoo! Would you give up your only child? Would you sacrifice your only child for Mrs. Stevens? Because I know you don't particularly care for her. Would you do that? I know you wouldn't do that? No, you wouldn't do it. But God did! Ggq! Sacrificed! His only child! For you! And you! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Whoo! Take camera two. Keep it tight, keep it tight. I don't know. God, God, God, I am not worthy. I am not worthy to be your humble servant. I feel love. I feel love. I feel your love! But I also feel your tremendous loss! I'm not worthy. Homerun, Law, homerun! - Nice sermon. - Thank you so much. Just when you think it can't get any better, it does. Well, thank you so much, Miss Wilks. Thank you very much. See you at home, Daddy? - Yes, baby. - Take care. - We'll talk. - Absolutely. Thank you so much. Good morning. Uh... my husband and I have a bit of sad news for you all this morning. Who is it? Hi. Uh, do know how much longer? Casandra, I'm busy, what do you want? L.C., we need to talk. L.C. What do you want, Casandra? I want my husband back. You reek. I'm sorry? - You reek? - I reek? The whole room smells like vomit. You been throwing up again? No, I have not been. No, I haven't. I don't need to talk. What's that for? This is all that should matter to you. So why don't you take it and go do what you do. Go shopping- I don't want to shop. I want my husband back. No, no! What are you doing? Don't talk. L.C., please. Sorry. I just want you to listen to me. What, what, what for? - Because... - What for? - What for? - To get back to us! All you're gonna do is just throw up! Look at you, you look a mess. I'm not gonna throw up. Look at this, all this, would you just... become skin and bones now. This is not who I married. I'm not skin and bones. This makeup, these baubles, this dress, all of this! What is this! You don't look like my first lady. I am your first lady! I bust my butt to be a first lady for you! And all you care about is this! Your filthy, dirty, - rotten - Get out! - Stinking, demon money! - Get out, out. You can't... Hello? What? No, I can't. I can't do it to... Not right now, I'm in the office. Yes. Is everything okay, sir? Sh"? How's the list coming? There's a small problem. Nobody wants to give up their seat, sir. Okay, what about Miss Bell? Minister, I didn't call Miss Bell 'cause... I kinda felt bad calling her. What did you just say? I didn't call her. I'm gonna ask you again, what about Miss Bell? What about her? Minister? Miss Bell is a good person. She's been here... When I ask you to do something! I need you to do it! Do you understand me! Have a seat, have a seat. I want this cleared up in the next 15 minutes. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So the doctor has me taking these pills for depression. And I just wanna thank the Lord for finally finding medication that really works. And I feel human again. Amen. I just wanna thank Jesus. I just wanna thank you Jesus! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Thank you! God is worthy to be praised, Hallelujah. Are you serious? Are you kidding me? No. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. What? You're right because you are not right with God. I can't believe you would thank Jesus for some pills. You're depressed because you're weak. You're depressed because you're not right with God. L.C...

I'm not sure what your excuse is for coming in this church, sitting behind your baby's mama, bringing a stray... this stray in the house of the Lord!

Praise the Lord. The Baptist convention will take place in Atlanta next week. Attending will be our choir director, Sister Evelyn Roberts... Sorry I got off on a bad foot with you. Excuse me.

Hey, Law. Hey. L'ma pray for you, man. Pray for me? You gon' pray for me? L'ma pray for you! What you mean, gonna pray for me? I'm gonna pray for you. You acting the fool, Law. - All right? - Why did you come here? How you gonna front to me in front of all these people. We're supposed to be brothers. We are brothers, you left! You gonna come back here and try to judge me, hate on me? What is this about, money? No, I don't need your money. I came back here because I thought you needed some help. I wanted to see if it was true all the things I was hearing about you. But you're lost, man, you're lost. Is that it? Is that the best you can do? You know what, I'm sorry I came. I'm sorry I came. I definitely did not expect to see the devil at work. I tell you what, Shirley, why don't you take this... - Get your hands off... - He needs the money? Who are you? I don't think I have to answer that. As a matter of fact, while I'm thinking about it, maybe you should've been dating me instead of this under-achiever right here. Stop. stop! You don't have to do that. Stop. stop! Get out of my church! - Stop it! - Get out of my church. Joey? Hi, Nish. You have to just tell him to stop sending me all these flowers, it's getting out of control. I have to be honest, um... I don't understand. I thought you knew who was your secret admirer. I know who the secret admirer is and I just... You're the secret admirer. I mean, you've been sending me all the flowers and all the messages and... What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing, it's sweet. I know my approach might be a little different. I was just afraid you would reject me. No, I would never... ever reject you, I'm honored. L... I mean, I, uh, I don't know what to say, I'm just... I'm just, uh... Say you'll go out with me? Uh... I really have to think about it. Will you think about it? And maybe call me? Yeah, I'll think about it. Thank you, Joey. Bye, Nish. You know, Joey has a crush on me. - Is that right? - Yup. I had no idea. Yeah, he's been sending me flowers and he's been texting me and all the time I thought it was you. You thought it was me? Yup. Sending you flowers? Well, he said it was from a secret admirer, so I just assumed it was you. 'Cause I wanted it to be you. Oh, well. L gotta go- If Rol? Yeah, baby, what's up? I haven't heard from Casandra in two days. I mean, that's not like her. Well, didn't she go to the Baptist convention? No, I know for a fact she did not go. Baby, you're worried about nothing. Okay? We should tum on some lights. No-no-no-no-no-no. It's not exactly like we have permission to be here, okay. Just... let's do this really quick before somebody calls the cops on us. Okay. Cass? Casandra? I'm telling you, she probably just went to Atlanta. Something doesn't feel right. Cass? Cass? - Did you hear that? - Hear what? That's... shh, shh. It's downstairs, downstairs, go back down. What is that smell? Honey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Stop-stop-STOP' stop-stop. Cass, stop, stop. Honey, what are you doing? Come on. Okay. - Come with me, okay? - Wait-wait. No, no, honey, come. Okay. My goodness, what are you doing to yourself? - Can you see? - I got it, I got it. We're gonna have a baby. Oh, wow. - Wow. - It's crazy. Oh, wow. Not you. Who's is it, hmm? Did you... what, what? Nish. Did you really just ask me that question, who's is it? Wow, okay. Nish. My sweet Nish, I cannot have kids. I have been trying to impregnate my wife for years. And the doctor's have told me that I have an extremely low sperm count so... I'm practically sterile, yes. So I think we need to take a look at your other partners. I don't have any other partners. Don't you lie to me! I don't have other partners. Why you reacting like that? I am having a baby! This is your baby. All you want is money? What? It's Joey's, it's Joey's. Is this Joey's? Huh? Joey! Is it money, you want money? - I can't believe... - Is it about money? Joey! Please, Our baby. Shh-shh-shh. Please. Shut up, shut up, shut up. You tell anybody and I will bury you, you hear me? Shh. Man'. Apparently long-time church member Marla Gifford had some sort of a disagreement with Minister Case, at least that's what we're hearing from other church members. That's when she showed up at the First Baptist Church with a large hunting knife. Now what you're about to see here may be a little too graphic for the younger viewers so parental discretion is advised. Take a look. You told me to pray, Pastor. What's wrong, Marla? You said that prayer would work. I can't sleep, I can't eat. I can't even function! You done told me" you done told me to get rid of those pills. You don't need them, Marla, you don't need those pills. - You don't need them. - Yes, I do. You need to simply pray. It doesn't work, stupid! Let me pray with you. God always listens to me. Always listens to me, just follow me. Just let me pray for you. You just gotta close your eyes. Come on, if you close your eyes... okay- Drop it... I'll break it, HI break it. - You got her? Got her. Mafia'. You're breaking my arm! Minister Case then was able to disarm and apprehend the deranged woman and she was promptly arrested. It's crazy. Cass... How long has this been going on? L.C.'s been out of control for, I don't know, like six... - six months or so. - No, no. It's just... I'm talking about you. Honey, you have an eating disorder. What? No, I don't have an eating disorder. Cass, you're either bulimic... - That's not fair. - Or anorexic. Shirley. You know, I really hate it when you do that. - Cass, I wouldn't say this - Nothing is wrong with me. If I didn't care about you. Okay, you're doing it again. We can help you find somebody who specializes in this kind of thing. Okay, okay. Cass... I'm keeping the baby. Nish. Let's think this through. If the board were to find out that I was the father of this child, I would be over. This is about our baby, Lawrence. I would lose everything, Nish. Why are you being so selfish? What... this is all about you? No-no-no, it's not about me, it's about our child. I'm begging you, Nish. If God wanted us to have this baby, he would want us to be married. I'm scared. I'm like... I'm gonna call your father and inform I will be leaving the church. Lawrence? Lawrence, don't cry, baby. Baby, don't cry. Listen, maybe we can move away. You know, we'll move, we'll go to a different city. We'll raise our child. You can start another church. You don't need them. We'll start another church. You're not being realistic. Your father's kill me, he's gonna kill me. My wife, she will divorce me, Nish. I don't care about your wife! Okay, you don't love her! Do you love her... No! I know, I know. Stop talking about her to me. Calm down, Nish. Okay, I'm... I'm... I'm gonna type up my resignation. Nish, I love you so much. I love you, too. Nish, do you believe me if I told you that I want to marry you as soon as my... as soon as my divorce is final, I swear to God I will marry you. You'll marry me? I gotta go. baby, I gotta go. Okay. Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought, okay, well, you guys are set for next Sunday. Oh, sorry, we're cash only. Okay, okay. Yes, that's the sermon right there, sir. This is excellent. Thank you. Paragraph form, just like you like it. Um-hmm. Hey, listen, uh... I need a big favor from you. No problem. You want another sermon? I can write another one up, no problem. No, no. I got myself in... into a little bit of a situation and, uh... Are you okay? No, I'm fine, I just need you to take a friend of mine to this clinic on Tuesday. And... Here we go. Oh, this is great. Pastor, um... This says it's about 70 miles away. Yeah, I know. Clinic, wait-wait-wait. This is an abortion clinic. Yes. You want me to take someone to an abortion clinic? - Why would you ask me... - I trust you more than anyone in this church. You can trust me, it, it... It just a lot at one time. I really need you to do this for me. Who am I taking? Come here, come here! Come here, come here, come here. But Pastor... I love you, boy. - Thank you. - Who? Who, who am I taking? Thank you. Brother Wilks' daughter. Nish? Yes, Nish. Whoa. You're married. - Whoa, whoa... - You've been with Nish? Come on, come on. No. Hey, hey, take it easy, I know how you feel about her but I need you to do this for me. No, I can't do it. Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey. I wanted to be with Nish. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. Hi, Pastor, I'm still at the church, but look. I can't prove it. But we know for a fact the members of the Republican party bought him off. Look, we need you back. There's a whole lot of disappointed members at that church. Well, as long as L.C.'s there I don't really see that as a possibility. When everyone saw you last week, the folks were generally excited to see you. Just come and be a guest speaker. Deaconess, it's Shirley. Were they excited to see us before or after the fight broke out? Well, I don't think L.C. will ever go for that. Well, that's not his decision. I'm in charge of booking guest speakers. He'll do it. What are you talking... I don't need that game. You don't need no game. What you doing? You just locked my door. Yeah? I wanna see you. Well, you can see me now. You know what I'm talking about. I want you inside of me. - Um-um. - Um-hmm. Hold on, hold on. Praise God, just a minute. Am I interrupting something? Oh, Nish. Oh, no, I was just leaving. You have lipstick on your face? No, Sister Roberts just kissed me on the cheek. She enjoyed the sermon. This is your cheek. This is your lips. This is your cheek, this is your cheek, what is... Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey, would YOU just stop it? - No, you stop! - Stop it. A woman kissed me on my cheek, end of story, you understand me? When am I going? Tuesday. Where? It's about an hour from here. What time are you picking me up? Not picking you up. What time are you picking me up? Yes, what time are you picking me up? Joey is taking you. You told Joey? - I trust him. - You told Joey?! Let's just be reasonable. Reasonable? You're telling me that you are not taking me and you are asking me to be reasonable? This is your responsibility. Look, I'm really sorry that I didn't know you like me. Don't sweat it. Are you mad at me? I'm not your man and... I don't have a right to be mad. If I need you to go first. My God. Hey... What's wrong? Hey, Pastor. There's nothing wrong. Everythingfs cool. I was... Shut up. And sit your ass down before I knock you down. Hey, hey, hey, Minister, how are you? Do you have a gun? What do you think it is? Huh? You crazy? Why would you say that? That man... Let's go in. I'm scared. Not laughing now, huh, Case? The way you laugh at my sermons on Sunday. Let me hear you laugh. Let me hear you laugh. Nurse, stat, room eight! Doctor? There's been a complication. There was a lot of blood loss. We're trying to help her regain consciousness. - Regain consciousness? - Yes. Now she needs a transfusion but she didn't put her blood type on the form. Do you know what it is? Mind if I get that? Yes, I do mind. - Look, let me explain. - Shut up! Now, I just wanna ask a few questions. Can I ask a few questions, Minister, please? Evelyn, can I ask a few questions? How long has this been going on, hm? Pastor, that doesn't matter. - Joey. - Pastor! I gotta call you back. - I, I... - I gotta call you back. Doesn't matter. Really? Well, let's just see what the congregation has to say about that on Sunday, Pastor. You think you can turn my congregation against me? It's just my word against yours. Really? I'm sure this picture will help me. Hello? Yeah? She's what? She's at a clinic and we need to know her blood type. Where are you?! We're about an hour away. She's A positive. A pos... Doctor! Doctor, she's A positive! Yes, yes, yes, I'm her father. Sir, I need your consent for a transfusion. Yes, you have my permission. Give me back that... get... put him back on the phone! Yes, sir? Give me the directions. Right now! Let's go, Evelyn. Come on. Look at me. You're going straight home. You understand? Let's go. Wait up, Pastor Roberts. Can we just talk privately, man to man for a moment, please. Please. Talk, Minister. That is, what you do best, right? Talk? How much? How much? 15,000? 25,000? Come on, Minister. 50,000. My Benz, the CLS? And you? A weekly feature on my live broadcast. Brother Wilks. Brothers Wilks, I can explain. - You need to get out. - I can explain. I said, get out! - I can explain. - Get out! Okay... Oh, dear God, take it out on me. Don't take my... Take it out on me. Hey, Joey, how did it go? Not good. What? There were complications and she lost a lot of blood. Oh my God. Can they give her any more blood? We couldn't because we didn't know her blood type so... I had to call her father. You what? I tried to call you but you kept hanging up. You called Brother Wilks? I had to. What? What did you say to him? I told him that she had a procedure and there were complications. You say anything about me? Not yet. What do you mean not yet? L'ma have to tell him the truth. Hold it, Joey, just... Hold it, let's just think this through. Pastor, she's dying... she's dying in there from aborting your child. Hey, look, look, we don't know if this is my child for starters. What? Are you serious? Joey, Joey, calm down. If I give you... If I give you, uh, if I give you $10,000 tomorrow, will you have my back on this? Pastor, I didn't wanna... I didn't wanna take her here in the first place. Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, it says in Luke, Luke. Luke 22:32. "But I have prayed for you that your faith should not fail. "And when you have returned to me strengthen your brethren. " Hello? Are you sure? Yeah. Let me get that for you. Come on, you need help. Hey! I got it, I got it, I got it. No, you're in the wrong button. I'm burning up. You are, you're sweating and you are shaking. Like a leaf. Lean back. Hey. Don't worry, okay, don't be nervous. You are gonna be amazing, okay? You're gonna be great. Thank you. I don't want him to preach, and that's final. Did you forget how this church is run? You don't dictate anything around here. I can have you replaced in two seconds. Oh, you really don't wanna open that can of worms now, do you? This is my church. No, this is the church we allow you to speak in. I have quadrupled the money that comes into this church. I have the highest-rated ministry on television. Without me, this church would be nothing! What are you scared of, L.C. huh? Are you scared that Roland just might upstage you? You're good, you're real good. Are you serious? Dead serious. You know what, Deaconess? I'll let him preach. You'll let him preach. Okay. And one more thing, Case. Yeah, what? If you ever physically touch me again I know people that will hurt you. Oh, Deaconess. Hey. That's my brother, Joey. How you doing, man? Heard you were looking for me. Yes, Joe, I have. My Joey. Joey... I really, really appreciate you not saying anything- Sure appreciate you. Take it. I don't want that. Joey, she... I heard she's gonna be okay. Thank God. Just go on, take it. I don't want that money. Now just hold on a minute, here, all right? If you walk out that door, you just keep on walking. You are no longer welcome at this church. And leave my keys on my desk! Why don't you think about this? I could've taken you places, Joey. Come with me. Come with me, take it. I pray to God I'm not going to places you're going. You keep that. Just hold on minute, hold on a minute, just hold on a minute. If you ever say anything. If you ever say anything. No one is ever gonna believe you. You hear me? Joey! If Good morning, church. I said, good morning, church. Good morning! We have a... special guest this morning. Young man who's been here with us for about 15 years and went off to start his own church, praise God. We wanna welcome him back, him and his lovely wife. I want the church to give him a big First Baptist welcome. For Pastor Roland Braxton. Come on up, Pastor. I'm, uh... truly blessed to be here this morning. When I agreed to come back and, uh, preach here today, it... it... Take your time, tell it! ...led me to reflect on, uh... all the things that have transpired in, in me and my beautiful wife, Shirley's life since we've been away. And now I can truly say that, uh... I know now what it's like to struggle. But I wasn't always in that place of humility and unselfishness. I was arrogant, I was brash, I was impatient, I was... I had my own ideas of what I should be doing. In Proverbs, it says that, "men may know wisdom and instruction, "understand words of insight. "Receive instruction in wise dealing, "righteousness, justice and equity. Yeah, yeah. "The wise man also may hear and increase in learning and the man of understanding acquire skill. " It's just one of the many lessons I've learned. Come on, now. I need you to step down now, come on. The Bible also says, "Man is bowed down. "And men are brought low. "But the Lord of hosts is exalted in justice. "And the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness. "He will raise a signal... "He will raise a signal for a nation far off "and whistle for it to the ends of the earth. None is weary, none stumbles. " Sit down. You can sit down, Rev. Amen. Wasn't that wonderful? Short and sweet. Just like I like it. We wanna thank Pastor Roland for his sermon today. And I was moved. By the reception of this church! For a man, who quite frankly, turned his back on his and walked away. From this church! We made a scene that he was off doing the Lord's work, but that wasn't the case. He wanted his own church. He wanted his own identity. Well, well. And he couldn't achieve that identity in the shadows of Dr. Cannon. So he turned his back on all of us and this church and set out on his own path designed by the devil himself. So now he comes back with his beautiful wife. Crawling back! Like a prodigal son. Coming to save the house and its riches! You know the story. Sit your ass down! Oh! Sit down, Rol. Your knees are burning! If God was truly on your side it would've succeeded, Amen? But it failed. He failed. You failed. He's a loser. He's an imposter disguised as a Pastor. He can't be sincere if he can't be an undershepherd. A true undershepherd. If your heart is filled with ego and greed, Roland. God is so good. God is so good. God is so good. Some of you have heard about Nish Wilks being ill and, uh, God sent some inspiring angels. But he wasn't done with it. We're done with you! We can talk about this after the service. As I was saying, God is there even when... you think he isn't. We want the truth. Can you please escort Brother Wilks out my church. Young man, I am the Chairman of the Board of the directors of this church. And I know you know who runs this church. Get down, L.C. Listen, listen. Tell 'em, L.C. If you have one ounce of decency left in you. Tell them! Tell them, what? You tell them the truth about how you used my daughter. Hold on, hold on, wait a minute, wait a minute. I know we got cameras in here but wait, one minute. Wait, one minute. The truth about your daughter getting pregnant by a member of this church? Tell them the truth about... The truth about her terminating one of God's children! The truth, you want the truth? I'll give you the truth, Brother Wilks. The truth is that my assistant Joey is the father of that terminated baby and that's why he is not here today so, yes. You want the truth about your daughter? The truth of your daughter is a whore. Oh my God! You wanna talk about free will? Son, I told you, that you were no longer welcome in this church, my house! The minister is lying! As God is my witness, Minister Case impregnated Nish. What? Wait! I've given you everything. And you wanna stand here and defame me and my character! You know I am a married man. I drove a young woman that you got pregnant to an abortion clinic where she almost died. And then... he asks me to say that I was the father. And I almost did. You almost did. Y'all finished? There's cameras in here. As God is my witness, I don't know what kind of reality show is going on here, Brother Wilks. L'ma pray for you. This young man is bitter because I let him go. People, please. Please, don't be fooled by this well-orchestrated opera! Roll the tape. Roll the tape. Wait, wait, this is an abortion clinic. Yes. Who am I taking? Nish. I wanna see you. I want you inside of me. Nish'. You told Joey... this is your responsibility. Tum this off, tum it off. Tell them! You're telling me that you are not taking me and you are asking me to be reasonable? Tum it off! Tum it off! I am human? I am human, all right, all right. Wait a minute. I am not a thief. I have made a few mistakes. It's over! I can't get no forgiveness? You don't know what you're doing. You don't know what you're telling me. I brought you here and I've made some mistakes. I admit to them. But I am the best thing that ever happened to you in this church! Shut up, shut up! I am the closest thing you will ever get to God! Get off of me! I built this church! And I can't get no forgiveness? I can't get no forgiveness? Get him out of here! You will love me again. The story of Reverend Lawrence Case should not be considered to be an indictment of the Black Church, but rather an indictment of man. Greed, corruption, infidelity, tax evasion, sex, deceit... all can and do rear their ugly heads in virtually every facet of our society. From politics to countries at war to marriages and yes, even to the pulpit. They are but a few of the infinite frailties that define us as a people. A footnote. Reverend Lawrence Case is now serving time for what many are calling the most significant tax evasion case of the decade. And while he may be locked up, he continues to do what he does best and that is preach. With good behavior, he is expected to be released in the summer of 2015. For "Hindsight," I'm Mike Rollins. Good night and God speed. If If
