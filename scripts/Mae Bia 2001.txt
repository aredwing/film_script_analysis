I'm sorry. The driver saw a snake so he stomped on the brakes. He wasn't sure if anyone hit their head. Bangkok folks think that was a big snake. But for the locals here in Suphanburi, that's a tiny one. At the Thai house we'll visit, there are no snakes. Don't be afraid! Miss Mekala, are you afraid of snakes? Snakes? They're not that scary. If we don't hurt them, they won't hurt us. Well, I'm afraid of them. Anyway, Miss Mekala, let me keep close to you. Mr. Boy, you seem more scary than the snakes. Chanachon a very unusual name. Mr. Pakpoom's friend. He spent most of his life abroad and just moved back to Thailand. I hear he's keen on Thai culture. Not a chance. Married, with one kid. Be careful, it's slippery. Please come in. Mr. Chanachon, are you okay? You look pale. I'm okay. Please come this way. You are welcome to rest here. I'll bring some water and snacks. This is cute. What kind of dessert? It's called "ja mongkut". A traditional Thai dessert. Where is Mekala? She's been gone for a while now. You seen to be a loner. Not really. I saw these beautiful flowers and I wanted to take a closer look. They're called "peep flowers". Very fragrant, but I'm not sure if you'll like them. Thai house are split into 3 sections. This house is rare-it is divided into 5 section. There's no electricity. We live like in the past. Locals think this house is haunted. Your ancestors must have had many wives. Actually, you're right. Both my grandfather and my father had several wives. Who are the people in the photo? My grandfather and his wives. This is my father and his wives. Where are you in this photo, Miss Mekala? Why don't you try to search for me... right where Mr. Chanachon is gazing. Here is Kosoom, my new wife. And this is Mekala. How old are you? Five, sir. The first year I was sent there on the job assignment, I had a wife. The next year I had a daughter. Kosoom. Here are my three wives, Chua, my first wife. Ning and Sai. You're new here. You must obey them. No fights are allowed. I don't like fights. Yes, sir. You too, Mekala. You must obey your step-mother the same as your own mother. Understood? Anyone who likes Thai flowers can follow me. There are lots of flowers here. We built a mound so they won't get flooded. Since we're here, let's see them. Watch out for snakes! Are there any here? Yes, a big cobra. Count me out! If you're not afraid of snakes, follow me. It's a jungle out her no one to care for it. Your housekeeper gave it to me. For making noise to scare off snake. That's a sugar cane knife. Be careful, it's very sharp. Old Yim was a sugar cane cutter. The cutters used to play a gambling game. No one plays it nowadays. What kind of flowers do I smell? Several kinds. The strongest smell is probably "kaew" flowers. It smells familiar. Not just the flowers but this Thai house, too. It seems familiar to me as well. I'm glad I met you. You seem to know a lot about Thai culture. I'm interested, too. I probably have to learn from you. My pleasure. How can I contact you? It's easy if you really want to see me. Let's go. It's time. You have to go see some other places. I didn't see any snakes. There is one but you just didn't see him. Hurry, grandpa. I'm scared! Me too! This afternoon why did you talk about snakes? So many people, I'm afraid someone would have met it. I was with them, he could not do any harm. He would not harm you, but not so sure for others. An innocent crowd would have get him angry. I going to change, go away. I told you to go. Just go. So annoying, I'll beat you to death someday. Any beautiful Thai house impress you? Just one but the owner probably won't sell. Piece of cake. You know money can buy everything these days. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm just not hungry. One ice coffee, Please. - Hello, Tao. - You're here so early, Mekala. If I'm late, you 'll be sold out. I want noodles with broth. - How are you, uncle? - I'm just fine. How many kids do you have? Hello! Please vote for Supoj-number 24. Don't forget to help us. Thank you. Are you running in the election? Details inside. Any questions, you can ask me. First, I planned not to ask. But since I met you, let me ask you something. Who chose the photo for the poster? Bad choice. I think Supoj looks much nicer in person. Let's go. You're wasting too much time here. After you're done, where are you going? Straight home? Not sure. It depends. I'll drop by later. Don't bother. Go do your own stuff. If you aren't elected, you're going to blame me. Use your muscles. How will it be clean if you do it like that? Kosoom, the floor is not that dirty. You don't have to overdo it. Yes, ma'am. But the ceiling beams are dusty. Clean them thoroughly so everyone can breathe easily. Be careful, Kosoom. Why did you teach your daughter to stare at people like that? I'm sorry, ma'am. Mekala, get over here! Now! I'm sorry, ma'am. She didn't mean to. I said get over here right now! Ma'am ma'am Mr. Supoj is here, ma'am. Tell him to wait downstairs. I'll be right there. Yes, ma'am. Mekala. It's OK. You can go. You are really mean you won't let me come upstairs to meet you. What's up? I want to take you for a boat ride. No, we'll be the talk of the town. We'll look like... ...we're having an affair. What about in the past? Didn't we have an affair? I thought we agreed... ...that it was just a fun fling and it already ended. But I don't want to end it, Mekala. I love you. Let's get back together. You're raping me, Supoj. I love you. Snake! Snake! Snake! Don't! No, please don't! You won't die for at least half an hour. Go to the health center. They have the serum. Be careful! The snake may be hiding somewhere! Hurry! Don't worry about me. Yes, I want to find out about a man with a snake bite. Yes, How is he? Yes. Thank you. - Here's a snack for you. - Thanks. Scorpio girls the reflection of your life has come. You must weigh between your desires and the right things. Your heart will guide you to happiness... ...but it may not be right thing. It may not be the perfect love. There's someone thinking about you and he must weigh it too. You guys, excuse me for a moment. Pakpoom, please take care of this client. I thought you threw away my phone number. I've been busy at work so I didn't have time to call you. I hope I'm not bothering you. Not at all. I'm glad you called. Thanks for meeting me today. No need to thank me. I'm glad we can meet again, Chanachon. Who gave you this name? My dad, my step-father did. Maybe he wanted me to conquer water. I had a bad experience in the water when I was young. You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to talk about it. That's OK. I'm happy to tell you anything you want to know. Have you ever felt like this... meeting someone for the first time and you just click? When you don't see them, you want to meet, waiting to talk... ...wanting to know more. Have you ever felt like this? How about you? Yes, just once in my life. I felt it once, too. May be it happened at the same time as you. When will you return to Suphanburi? I want to go back there again. I'm not sure. Sometimes, when I want to go, I just do. No advance planning. Thank you for taking me to a place with really good atmosphere. One thing I need to tell you. I'm married. I want to tell you. Because if I don't tell you, I will be miserable. I envy your wife. She has an adorable husband. If I go next Sunday, do you still want to go? Other than doing business in Thailand, are you planning to stay here permanently? We are planning to buy a house here. David loves Thailand so much. He said it was love at first sight. I feel really touched to Thailand. Excuse me. This is Mai. I just found out my mother will arrange a 60th birthday party for... - my father this Sunday. - This Sunday? Why? Am I calling you too late? This Sunday I have to inspect a site with Mr. David. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you before. Too bad. My father will be disappointed. That's OK, though. I'll tell my mother that you'll come later. Bye. Excuse me, sir. I don't understand Chinese. Grandpa is telling you about your life. Tell him I'm not interested. Grandpa says be careful. Somebody will take you away. Danger from a snake or the river. Grandpa says be careful. He sees death around you. What the hell is wrong with you? Wait for me! Quick! Nuan! Please let me see Nuan. Nuan, are you alright? Is Nuan alright? What's going on? You don't look too good. No, it's nothing. Then let's get in the boat. I've been afraid of water since I was little. I tried to learn to swim many times. Never could. Last time you were not this scared. Last trip, the boat was bigger. A lot of people, too. It wasn't this scary. The more people, the more dangerous. This time, only two. You are my only responsibility. I'll take care of you. That's okay you can stand up. Go ahead, just stand up. If the snake was not there in time, I don't know what would have happened to Nuan. Are you sure they were the two? I couldn't see them clearly. But if they were bitten like that, I'm sure it must be them. There's more than one cobra in the world. I know, you already said that. Deep inside, you know the one that did it. I'll take it to him. What's up? Why don't you change outside this room? No one answered the phone, Mom. That's OK. Soon, your father should be in a better mood. It's his 60th birthday and he wants to see everyone. Chanachon is very busy, mother. I have no idea when he'll be finished. I'll keep checking. You must have been here for along time. Yes, 5 or 6 years before Mrs. Kosoom, Mekala's mother came here. I thought you were a local person. I'm from another province. I was in big trouble then. A friend took me here to work for the Mekala's father. Is that lady your wife? No, we're not related. I have no relatives now. I used to have a sister, a brother in law and a nephew. They're all dead. I'm sorry. What happened to them? Drowned right here. Two bodies were found my nephew's body never was found. Daeng must have become food for the crabs and fish in the river. If he was alive, he would be about your age. I had no idea that you're such a good cook. My mother taught me but I'm not half as good as Mom. This coconut is fresh from the tree. The locals eat it with palm sugar. Do you want to try some? Use 3 fingers to scoop. Use your thumb to push the food in your mouth. Do you eat like this at every meal? Not really. This is a special program to attract tourists. Especially this tourist. He's quite fascinated with Thai culture. With service like this, I'll have to... ...use Mekala's tour service more often! Save your praise. There are other special programs waiting for you. If we put some money in the lantern, the old folks believe we're doing something good for the river. Wish for good things while the bad karma floats away on the river. After we float them, we'll get the good luck we wished for, right? It's just a superstition. I'll make a wish anyway. For you, you must have everything already. You don't need to wish for more. Not yet. There's one thing I really want but haven't gotten yet. Then make your wish. I want to see the river a little longer. Would you mind if I spend the night here? May I? I can sleep out there. I think you must really be attracted to this place. I'm not sleepy yet. You should go to bed. It's late. Mekala, are you alright? I wonder how you raised your child. The girl can't even iron clothes. What's all that noise? It's Mekala. She's so clumsy the iron fell on her. It's true, sir. It was nothing serious. Her screams startled everyone. That's not true. Look, how come the wound is this big? Do you think I'm lying, Kosoom? That's enough Don't make such a fuss. You too, Kosoom. Tell Mekala to be more careful. Be careful next time. Be patient. Stop crying. My daughter mustn't let anyone see her crying. If those people who mistreat us see you cry, they'll mistreat us even more. Why do they have to treat us like this? Because we the newcomers. No one wants us to outshine them. Mekala, just wait, I will not let anyone harm you anymore. What's that, mother? It's krachai, in the old days, people used it for... ...For what? It's not kid's stuff. Go stir the curry for me. I'll take care of this. It's delicious and spicy. No one else makes it like this. Up so early. The bird woke me up. What kind is it? It's a koel bird. It sings only in the morning. It's time for me to go, isn't it? Please have some breakfast. My maid has prepared some rice porridge for you. It's me. Where have you been all night? Don't you know I'm worried about you. I'm sorry. I forgot to take my mobile phone with me. Is that dad? It's your father. Tuan is about to be vaccinated. Talk with him. Hi, Dad. What's up, cowboy? I'm about to have a shot. I know you're not afraid, are you, cowboy? No, I'm not afraid of the needle but I am afraid of pain. Just a pinch like an ant's bite. When a doctor gives you a shot, you just think about other stuff. It will be over even before you know it. I'll think about you. That's alright, mom will be by your side as well. Thank you. I'll see you at Counter #8. Thai International, 5 am. Thank you. Good luck! Rich! Our job horoscopes are not that great lately. Love horoscopes are bad, too. Unbalanced love. Unrequited love or loving someone who belongs to someone else. Just be patient. Patience will get us through this. You must be hiding something. Not worth knowing. Nothing can be done. It's not certain. If you feel so uneasy, I'm here to listen. Tonight, let's go hear some music. It's been a while since we had some fun. Isn't it? Latino dance is very in. Thinking about dancing all night. Shouldn't have come here for jazz. It's not too bad. It has a sad tone. Why do you want to torture yourself psycho! I think you're a little strange lately. Is it about Chanachon? What? Chanachon who? C'mon, admit it. We've been friends for a long time. I'm not blind. I'm not deaf. I just want to know... ...if he's thinking about me as much as I am about him. I'm sorry, Mai. That's quite alright. You just have work stress. Hello. It's me. Let me take you out for dinner. Some other time. I'm very busy. Are you still mad at me? That's not the reason. I'm really busy. If that's all, I'm hanging up. What's going on? Let's go to your house. This is my house. Don't be afraid he's here for warmth pay respect to him. You're mad at me, aren't you? Go ahead. Bite me if you think that I did something wrong. Go away. I told you to go away. Go! Wake up morning time already. It's time for me to go, isn't it? Hey Mai Good morning, you're very early. Is Chanachon here? He's not in yet. He'll be in shortly. Would you like to wait in Mr. Chanachon's room? I can't find the gentleman who came with you. What are you doing here? Old Tim should have come with you. I followed the sound of the birds. What's that fragrance? It's the saiyoot flower. Saiyoot stops making its fragrance after morning. Being late doesn't stop its charm taking away sadness. I thought you grew up overseas. Now you can make clever Thai rhymes. Let's get in. I've prepared a hot meal for you. Please stop. Nuan might see us. Watch out! Are you alright? Don't follow him you can't see it. You hurt him. He'll get back at you. Revenge? Sorry, but it's just a snake. Perhaps it's dead. It's not just an ordinary snake. Please go change your clothes. Please go back. You should leave now. You must be hurt. I'm sorry I have to apologize for him. He was frightened. He thought you would hurt me. Please don't harm him. He's the man I love. I told your friend to leave. You shouldn't let him come back here again. How is the snake doing? I saw its blood on the tip of the knife. Stop! Are you alright? You can't come back here ever again until I'm sure that he's gone. You probably don't believe in the snake's revenge. But I do. I'm not afraid. I want to come back. Don't be stubborn. Let's go. Who's calling? No one there Probably a bad phone signal. "Next week is Sports Day. I want you to come" "I promise, son" You're home! Well running out of energy? Mai what did you just say? I asked you if you ran out of energy... ...and had to come home. So how was it? Having lots of fun with that slut Mekala? You must think I'm some stupid housewife, that I know nothing. I'm sorry I trusted you. Keep it down you'll wake up our son. Why? Do you feel ashamed of our son or who? It's me who has to be ashamed. My friends, my family, what will they think about this? That I have such a promiscuous husband. I'm sorry I know that I'm totally wrong. It's easy for you to say you're sorry. Sorry all finished? You can go sleep with that whore. I don't think we can make any sense now. That's right. I'm making no sense. Why don't you go find people who make sense. Go! Don't use me as an excuse... you want to sleep with that Mekala or other whores. Go ahead. Go wherever you want. Go! Your life is perfect. I don't want to ruin it. It's not what you think. Don't blame yourself for it. What happened was totally my decision. I chose it to happen. I was part of it. You know when I'm down, I'll think about you and your Thai house. Because I feel like it's my home. I want to go back to that house again. Promise me that you'll never return to that house. I'll be there right away. We're almost finished just a little bit longer. It's alright I'm here be patient, cowboy. A hero must not cry, right? OK, done. He's lucky that he's not allergic to the sting. Otherwise, it would hurt more. Are you alright son? I'm OK now. She helped me. Last night, I stayed at Grandma's house. I'm sorry I left you home alone. Who's in charge of the European tour next trip? Sornchai and Amara. Add me to the list, just one way trip. I'm not sure when I'll come back. I want to take a vacation for awhile. Sounds good A change of climate will help. If someone calls, just say that I'm out. Except me? Are you alright? Watch yourself. Last time, you wimped out after only 20 shots. This time, I'm making it up to you. You know, I'm so happy that we're together tonight. Don't go too far. Who I'm with is no big deal. You aren't give up, are you? Said who? Mekala wait for me. Mekala Watch out for the snake. I beg you to go away from this house. Get out of my life. Where are you going? To kill the snake. I've told Mekala and she wouldn't mind. Where is it? Near the saiyoot tree. I see him there a lot. Show me the way. No. I don't want to be involved I'm afraid of sinning. I think he was bitten. You whore! Can't you find some other man? Why my husband? What's your problem? I haven't been involved. With your husband for a long time. It's you. You're the cause. Without you, my husband would be alive. You killed him, do you hear me? Where are you? Come out now. You must be hurt. You're cruel. You killed my friend. You must be hurt Get away from here. Get out of my life. If you don't, I'll leave. Father, don't forget about Sports Day tomorrow. I'll meet you at three. I won't miss it. We'll wait and see. Stop treating me like crap. It all passed, didn't it. Sure. If my friends know, no one will forget. How can I show my face? Keep eating keep up with me if you can. Your passport and ticket are all set. Departure tomorrow, 3 pm. Thanks. Don't forget that we purchased it at a very high price. Before giving some land to the public to build a road. I think we should give it some more thought. But if the people tell the newspaper, our company's image is ruined. Who'll do business with us after that? I don't think it's connected. Business is business. I think, I insist, we should stand for what is right for society... for the company's reputation. And you Chanachon, what do you want us to do? New message, Read now? Bring some towel. I'm a friend of Mekala. Mekala is leaving for Europe. The rest is up to you. Are you ready? Not yet. Dad! I'm sorry. I don't think that the meeting would last this long. Why were you so late? Do you know he kept looking for you? If you showed up from the start, we wouldn't have lost. I said I was sorry some work affairs in the meeting. Work affair or other affair? Mai this is in front of our son. Stop being rude. I told you it was my fault. It's all over. Mekala already left. Now you admit it. What about that whore? Was it her fault too? That she stole somebody's husband? Tuan, I'm not going back with you yet. I'll see you tonight. Where are you going? Do you think that whore is better than me? Go! Don't come back. You bastard! You betrayed me. Old Tim Old Tim Somebody wants to see you. Why are you here? Miss has gone abroad already. It was this afternoon, wasn't it? Please go back there's nothing for you here. I'm not here for Mekala I'm here to see you. I have something to talk with you. Let's talk over there. Miss doesn't want you to come here. I'll take you back. I think I'm your lost drowned nephew. I don't know my parents. I was taken out of a river when I was so young. It was in the night and the place like this. Let me ask you something. The day that your sister's boat sank... was it during the day or at night? Please don't! You took him from me. Is that what you want? You're cruel. You killed my man. Why don't you kill me too? Bite me-I told you to bite. Kill me. There's nothing left for me. You don't want to kill me. Fine. If you don't want to kill me, I'll kill you to finish all of this. Forgive me.
