Lime Road? - Old Lime Road. - Rebecca, help your dad out here. Rebecca. I think we're lost. - Sorry, Dad. - Okay. All right. - I saw these before. - Saw what? This. It all looks the same. I don't know. If you took the right, left at the right... - You can't even hit me back. - ... at the right barn. Or was it the left, left at the right barn? Do you remember when he took the wrong exit? - Right? - We ended up going... - No, no, that's not... - Twice. - No, that's not true. - He did it twice. - It was not properly marked. - He did it twice. - It was not properly marked. - You circled twice. Okay, ha-ha. Listen, this is... that was the right barn. I'm pretty sure that this was the right road. Well, I mean, it's not that I don't trust your keen sense of judgment, Captain, but why don't we just stop and ask? There's an idea. Come on, ask, ask. Ask, ask, ask, ask. Ask, ask ask. I'm gonna go in here and check it out. - I listen to my family. - Wrong turn. Is there... is there... is there a fellow there? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That's enough. Whew! Hallelujah! All right, there is a word I like to hear. Let's be saying it when we find out where we are. Oh, that's nice. Isn't that pretty? For the tenth time that we've seen it today. I know. Sorry, Dan. I'll go up and check. - Okay, Christopher. - Take the boy. - Let's go. - Dad. See you in a minute. Good luck. Something tells me this town won't have a mall. A mall? Come on, I'll settle for indoor bathrooms. Hello? Hello! Anyone here? Hello! Excuse me. You folks looking for something? Sorry. Yeah, we saw your farm here and... You lost or something? Well, to be honest, I think we may be a little lost. There's a gas station a couple miles back the way you came. You can get a map from them. Okay. I was just... I was just looking for a town called Stull. I think we took a wrong turn a mile or so back. So we'll get out of your hair. Sorry for having bothered you. You wouldn't be the new pastor, would you? Well, actually, yes. How did you know that? Well, Pastor Kingsman asked me to keep an eye out for you, make sure you're okay. I'm just so glad that you made it, Pastor. I was starting to get a little worried. Your moving truck passed by a couple of hours ago. Oh, that's good to hear. I know my wife will certainly be happy to hear that. Are we far from town? Oh, no, no, not at all, just a couple of miles or so. I'm Pastor Dan Bramford. Nice to meet you. This is my son Christopher. Christopher. Oh, got a good QT) on you, boy . Yeah. I'm... I'm Mason. Nice to meet you. I'll just... I'll just bring my truck around. You can follow me. Okay, that's great. I told you we weren't lost. Hey! Honey! Welcome to Stull! Oh, no. You gotta be kidding me. Give me five. I got you here. You did it. I hate to say I told you so. - All right. - He's gonna come by with the truck and pick us up, show us into town. Oh, my God, what the hell is that guy doing? I don't know. Oh. Oh, yuck. Well, that is just not appropriate for you to see. - Eww. - You, too. - In the car. In the car. - Come on, guys. - Are you folks ready? - Yeah, we are. I'll just drive right up there and wait for you. Thank you, Mason. All right, kids just got their first taste of the country. We won't need these anymore. It's not as small as you thought it was, Rebecca. - This is Main Street? - What's that? - Ice cream? - Look. Christopher wants to go there. - Is that us? - I think. - Is that us right there? - This is... - Is that it? Oh! - Are you kidding me? - That's it. - Oh. - Can you believe it? - Ma'am, I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to meet you back at the farm, but I'm Mason. Oh, I'm Wendy. - This is gorgeous. - Oh my goodness. I'm glad you like it. I'm just glad I showed you where it was. Oh, my. Can you... what's... it's amazing. Um, hi. Hi. Excuse me. Be careful. Becky... uh, Rebecca. It's okay, Dad. You can still call me Becky. It's... it's really nice. Yeah. Big change. I know that you are gonna make the most of it. Excuse me. Hi. Thank you. I gotta go help your mom. I... I'm sorry. Can you help me? I'm so confused. Where are the movers and... Let me help you. I don't know what's going on. Did the movers just leave everything on the ground? No, no, no, they were nice fellows. We just figured you didn't want any strangers traipsing through your house. Some fellows from church came by to help. - Pastor Kingsman. - Oh, Pastor Bramford. - How are you? - Good. Good. I thought you were a mover. I'm so sorry. Well, today I'm a mover. Who knows what I'll be tomorrow? I know I speak for everybody when I say we're awfully glad you're here. - Thank you. - Well, I think six states, three children, countless rest stops... - I think no one's happier than we are. - I expect that's true. - Here, Dan. - Sure. - Fragile. - Yeah, should we? - Dining room? - Dining room, gents. - All right, let's go. - You be the captain out there. Captain, I know. Thank you. Oh, yeah. Excuse me, I think that goes into the living room. Thank you. Hi, sweetheart. - Hi. - Can you believe it? Um, kitchen. Thank you. Okay - Can you believe it? - This place is so nice. - This place is huge. - I know, right? - Mom, can I pick out my room? - Well, yes, after your sisters, 'cause they're older than you, so they get first choice. - First choice? - First choice. - Second choice. - Hey, girls, Christopher, please say hello to Pastor Kingsman. The man responsible for all of this. Oh, well, I wouldn't say I'm responsible. I think a higher power called you to our little town. Well, certainly. Thank you. It's nice to meet you, girls. - Nice to meet you. - Go. Get up there. - Stop pushing me. - I'll help. Stop. - I like the window in here. - This room is cool. I saw it first. I call dibs. You heard what Mom said. I'm older than you. I get first dibs, kiddo. Second dibs. Second's better than the third, you weirdo. What? You didn't get the crappy third one. Damn it. Let me guess. Yep. Mine. Mom! Oh, thank you so much. This is incredible. Everybody's so... so sweet. - And this kitchen is amazing. - Well, I'm glad you like it. I'm not much of a cook myself, so I have to take your word for it. - That's not your handiwork? - Oh, no, no, no. - That's... that's Mrs. Gordon's. - Oh. She... she's pretty famous for her cakes around here. - Looks delicious. - They're good. Yeah, melt your tongue right off. So, Dan, what do you say we rip the Band-Aid right off and get you up on that pulpit tomorrow? - Oh. Oh. Oh. - Oh my goodness, Dan. - I'm not sure that I'm ready. - I know it's quick, but folks are anxious to meet their new pastor. Well, you know, he's got big shoes to fill. - I'm sure they're gonna miss you a lot. - No, no, no. I've been here a number of years. They're about ready to see me move on. - No. - I'm looking forward to retirement. I think it's about time we had some new blood around here. - Oh. - Well... - Come on, sweetie. - What do you say? Rip the Band-Aid right off. - Huh? - All right. How's the sermon going? Oh, fine. Good. The usual battle. How are the girls? They're good. You did the right thing, you know. The house is perfect. I'm almost finished unpacking downstairs. It looks so good. I'm glad you're happy with it. I think moving is always hardest on the children. - Yes, I know. - The new school, the new friends. They'll adjust. You know they will. I think they're gonna like it. It's not like we had that much of a choice. - No? - No. - We have a bigger boss. - Oh. He called you to be here. As long as we're together, that's all... - Nothing else matters. - Nothing else matters. I'm going with two years. What, too little? 10 years. 10 years? Are you kidding me? No, they live for about 45 days. The stronger ones can live a little longer, like 60 days. 10 years... they'd have grey hair. Yeah, I guess 10 years is kind of a long time for an ant to live, huh? Yeah. Rebecca, do you think I'll make friends here? You kidding me? You? Mr. Personality? Of course you're gonna make friends. Think about how much a big city slicker kid like you knows compared to these guys. Mary, honey. - Guys. - What? - Are they here? - Mary, come here, please. - Put that away. Turn off the light. - Hi. Here. It's our first night here and I just wanted to say a little something. Come on. Hey. A big change for us. And your mother and I would like you to know how much we appreciate the love and support that each one of you has given us on our journey. I think we had a great life in the city, but I believe the Lord has called us here. He didn't call me. Okay, all right, He called. Okay, put our hands together. Heavenly Father, thank You for protecting us on our long journey. Please, we ask You to watch over us and guide us... Wait up for us. Oh, good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, friends. Good morning. Now before I get started, I promised Mr. Roberts that I would mention that we still need a few volunteers to help us set up for tomorrow's summer festival, so if you have a little extra time and want to lend a helping hand, please see Carl after the service. Please be seated. I have spent a lot of years here with you and I would like to believe that through all those years we have built a community of love and faith. I would also like to believe that we have learned to trust each other. Now trust is a very funny thing. It requires absolute belief in one's soul, a complete faith. But it's different than faith. Trust also obligates the person that is being trusted to do the best he can. And so I am asking you to trust me one more time as I prepare to leave you. Today we welcome the Bramfords. Pastor Dan, his lovely wife Wendy and their three beautiful children have all consented to join us. And I trust that you will show them the same love and compassion that you showed me so many years ago. The Bramfords have made a great sacrifice to be here with us. So let us welcome them with open hearts and open arms. Pastor Dan, your people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Pastor Kingsman. - And good morning, everyone. - Good morning. First of all I would like to thank you for welcoming my family and I into your lives. When I first received the offer to become your pastor here in Stull, my wife Wendy and I were unsure... unsure about moving a family halfway across the country, unsure about leaving behind a life that we had come to know and understand, unsure about a new adventure. But in times of unsureness, in times of great decision, I put my faith in the Lord, that He would provide for us, that He had a plan for us. I think my faith was like a rock. I was reminded of Matthew, chapter 7, verse 24, which I would like to read to you this morning. "Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house on a rock. And the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house. And it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock. And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened to a foolish man which built his house upon the sand." So nice to meet you. God bless. Thank you. Thank you. Not really your scene, huh? What? This whole thing. I saw you inside. You weren't singing. And then you left during the sermon. I could say the same for you. Sounds like you were paying more attention to what I was doing. Well, maybe, but that's just 'cause you were so obviously not into it. Yeah, you're right. I'm not much into singing and just not big on the whole sermon thing. - No offense to your dad. - None taken, trust me. I saw you and your family when you got into town yesterday. I take it y'all met Mason. Oh, Mason? He's the farm guy? Yeah. Yeah, the farm guy. Okay, so then you were the guy with the lambs and... Technically they're sheep. Wow. Well, you clean up well. Maybe I'll see you around and show you the town. Yeah, cool. Yeah, that'd be awesome. "You clean up well"? Idiot. I have a hard time believing that your boxes are unpacked and your room is clean. Huh? Mom, stop. I'm hungry. Do we have any food in the house? You're hungry? Yeah, there's a little something. I'm sure you can make do. - And my boxes are unpacked. - Uh-huh. - But define clean. - Exactly what I thought. You know I hate living in the mess, honey. Relax. It's only been a day. They're just boxes. - Breathe. - I'll breathe when you help me out. Oh, yeah. Okay, we are definitely gonna need an escape plan. She's driving me nuts. I swear, if she brings up unpacking one more time, I'm gonna kill her. I'm serious. We need a plan. Okay, like you mean the time that we told Mom we were going to Sonia Rosen's house to sleep over, so that we could see the Stone Roses? Yeah, we probably should have told Sonia Martin about that plan. - Somehow I got blamed for that one. - You did not. I got it way worse than you. I was grounded for, like, two months. Remember? Because I should have known better. Yeah, you should have known better. Hey, what are you eating? I'm starving. Just peanut butter and jam I found on the counter. Mm, sounds appetizing. Um, I would not do that if I were you. Mom said we're saving that for after dinner tonight. It's our first family dinner in the new home, blah, blah, blah. Oh, please. No, seriously, dude, you know how Mom gets about that shit. None for me, thanks, but when Mom kills you, - I'll take your purple sweater. - Fine. Mm, so good. Are you okay? Mary! Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Jesus. - Are you okay? - What was that? I have no idea. Eww. Oh. I can't believe this came out. - I know. - Holy shit. Fuck. Hi. What are you doing here? I told you I was gonna take you around and show you some stuff. Oh, yeah. I just didn't know you meant today. Is today bad? No. Come in. What happened? You have no idea. - Who puts a tooth in a cake? - Tell me about it. It cut the crap out of the roof of my mouth. This is one of old Mrs. Gordon's cakes. A nice lady, but she's almost 95. Let's just say you're lucky this is all you found. Lucky? There. No more cake. So are you ready to go? Um... Just go, Becca. I'm fine. Go. Escape. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'll be fine. A little weirded out, but I'm fine. Okay Bye. So, not that this hasn't been great, it has, but is there anything to actually do in town? This isn't exactly the big city. I know it's not the big city, but there's gotta be something. There really isn't anything to do. Well, I mean, could you give me a chance to figure that out for myself maybe? Please? Fine. So how long have you lived here? I don't know. A long time. I guess you're used to it then... the whole country thing. No, you never really get used to it. You just sort of adapt. I wasn't exactly thrilled about moving here, but it's kind of nice. - Afternoon. - Hello. I should probably get you home. What? I thought we were having fun. It's not that. It's just it's getting late. I don't want your parents worrying. Oh, please. Noah. Noah, Pastor Kingsman is looking for you. Tell him I'll be there in a few. He wants you now. I've got to go home. Home? You live with Pastor Kingsman? Noah. I'll explain later. Are you gonna be okay getting home, young lady? Yeah, sure. Noah. Noah. Has the choice been made? Noah. I know you're probably scared right now. But you can do this. You're prepared for this. You can do it, son. I'm not your son. And you have no idea how I'm feeling right now. You're right. I wouldn't pretend to know how you're feeling. But you knew this day was coming. And there can be no mistakes... none. Humble yourself before the Lord, Noah. We are His servants. We are here to do His will. We should not question what is beyond our understanding. Put aside your weaknesses, and He will give you strength. Do not get close to them... to any of them, to her. Here. Who is it? The younger sister... Mary. - Was it delicious? - It was delicious. Yeah, it was delicious. Oh, hi, honey. Look, I left a plate for you in the oven. How was your day? Did you have fun? Rebecca has a boyfriend. Rebecca has a boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. Well, I sure hope not. You've only known him a few hours. - Where's Mary? - She's upstairs. She hasn't been feeling well all day. Oh, yeah, no problem. Don't worry about it. You're welcome for that plate I left for you in the oven. Oh, you think that's funny, do you? Ooh, wow, you look like shit. Thanks. I feel like shit. How's your mouth? Eh, it's okay. How was your date with Romeo? Fine, until that weird Mason guy found us and told him to go home. Guess where home is. He lives with Mason? Pastor Kingsman. What? Yeah, exactly. It was weird. Nice but weird. Okay, why don't you start with the nice? I don't think I can stomach the weird just yet. You do know we have two separate rooms now, right? Sorry. I was just so tired. I didn't feel like... Walking all the way down the hall. Oh, you poor thing. All that flirting with that Noah guy must have really taken a toll on you. Ha-ha. You feeling better? Eh, a little bit. But I've got to get out of this house. So come on, get up. Let's go into town, check out the boys. I need a little fun. - What are you doing? - No, no, it's good. Oh, no, that doesn't look very good at all, actually. - Easy now. Easy. - What's with all the cookies? Well, they are supposed to be for the festival, if your dad doesn't ruin them all. Hey, easy. I'm trying my best. Honey, yuck. Don't give him all of your mistakes. - No, no, this is not a mistake. - He is gonna get sick. So are you sure you're gonna make it? Yeah, I'm fine. It just hurts to eat. - Okay, but I want to get out of here. - I know. - A masterpiece. - I'm watching you. That looks... I'm gonna go to the park with Pastor Kingsman. That sounds like a really good idea, honey. Yeah, a pastor needs to be with his people. Oh, can me and Mary go to town too? 'Cause we want to walk around a little bit. So nobody's gonna help me out at all? - No. - No. Fine. Take your brother. And get him something other than a cookie to eat. All right, come on then. Let's go. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Come on, come on, come on. - Out of here. Out of here. All right, you girls, make yourself useful. - Help people out. - Okay, Dad. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, Pastor. - How are you? - Nice to see you. - Hello to you too. - Want to help her out? - Hi. Hmm. Okay. Not bad. He's kind of cute. 10 seconds. It took you 10 seconds to find your mark. It's a gift. Hi. What are you doing? Well, I'm Mary and this is my sister Rebecca. - Smooth. - Shut up. So have you lived here long? - Hi. - Hey. Why are we hiding? We're not hiding. Well, maybe a little bit. You want to get out of here? Actually, there's something I'd like to show you. - Right now? - Yeah. Is that cool? Yeah, sure. Let me just go tell Mary. Okay What, is that your kissing both? - No. - He's really cute. Um, I think he just asked me out. Nice. Can you cover for me? Well, I can, but it's gonna cost you. All right, fine. At least one of us is doing all right. All right, thanks. - Hey. - Hey. Is it weird? Ls what weird? Moving away from it all, away from your home. My parents seem really happy. I think they were tired of the city. What about you? Me? I'm fine, I guess. I mean, it's different, but it's okay. Just okay, huh? So where are we going? - You'll see. - Okay. So you brought me all the way out here to show me an old rusty tower? This is so much more than an old rusty tower. Really? Yeah, really. I want to show it to you, but if you're scared... Oh, you think that rickety old ladder that climbs, what, 100 feet in the air is too scary for me? Please. Come on. What, are you chicken? Come on. Oh, my God. This is beautiful. I told you. This is where I come when I want to get away from everything. It's kind of special to me. Well, you weren't kidding. It's amazing. And you can see everything from up here. Makes you feel like there is a world beyond here. There is a world beyond here. You know what I mean. Thank you, Noah. For what? For taking me here. I can see why it's so special to you. I'm just glad you like it. So are you gonna stay here in town? What do you mean? I live here. No, I know you live here, but I just thought since your dad's retiring and everything, maybe you... My dad? Pastor Kingsman. Kingsman's not my dad. He's not your dad? But you live with him. Sorry. It's none of my business. No, it's fine. When I lost my family, Kingsman took me in. He's strict, but he's a good guy. I get the feeling he doesn't want us hanging out. Why would you say that? Well, that whole thing with Mason was a little weird yesterday. And us hiding from him today... I just... I feel like he doesn't like me. It's not that. He's just being protective. He's not so keen on the whole dating thing. Oh. So this is a date? I... I... I'm just kidding. Who is that? What? There's a guy down there watching us. Where? We should go. Why? Who is it? I don't know. We should just go. We shouldn't be up here. Did you think I wouldn't find out? You were gonna betray us... all of us. I will not let that happen. So I just have to put up with this shit? My God, Noah, you've seen it. You know what it's capable of. Why can't we stop it? It is God's will. We are His servants. We must do everything we can... You're a fucking liar. Stop being such a child! Yes, we've been lied to. Yes, we've been told stories... stories of angels that will come down from heaven and slay the demons and send them to hell and protect us all. There are no angels! There is only us. You know what needs to be done. And I need to know you'll do it. There is no other way. I just wish there was something I could do to save them. Do your part. Oh, goodness. Hello. Mom, I'm gonna head off, okay? Oh, you like that, don't you? All right, well, you can go play with the other kids. - Okay, Mom. - Don't go too far. Check in with us. Mmmmm. I think we should do this in the backyard. Hello. How are you? We're neighbors. It's so nice to meet you. - Hello. - Hi. Nice to see you. Well, aren't you handsome. - Hi. - Hi there. Hi. Yeah, I got it. I got it. You did it. Awesome. Would you like some popcorn? Ooh! Was that you? Dad, you should try. Come on. Let's get out of here. - Dad, please. - You do it. Let him put you... - In the tank? - Come on, come on, come on. - Oh, really? - Come on, come on. - So do you see him anywhere? - Who? Oh, don't even. You know who. Noah. No, but he said he was coming, so I'm not worried. So what do you guys think? Well, it's not totally lame. Yeah. Um, are there some cool games or something? Yes, sure. Come on. All right, let's see what you got. Nice. That was not even close. All right, all right, all right, all right. Nice. Oh, you guys really suck at this. Shut up, Noah. You're taking all the fun out of it. I'm just saying. And aren't you the one that's supposed to be winning us a prize? - Maybe he just can't throw a ball. - Well, that's true. - Let me show you something. - Oh, excuse me. - Oh. - Holy shit. Maybe... maybe he can. I don't know. Let's just take a seat. - I'm good. Thank you though. - No? No? - I'm also good. - Thanks. Cute. Let's see what you got, Mary. Oh, I'm not... I can't follow that. I'm kind of thirsty. You guys want to grab something to drink? Oh, that sounds good. I want one of those pies I keep seeing around. - Of course you do. - Shut up. Do you see them? They look so happy. - They just fit right in here. - I know. It's kind of perfect. Thank you. - So what can I get for you kids? - Do you have pie here? - We sure do. - Can I have one? What about you? What would you like? You? Anything to drink? We'll have three lemonades, please. All right, well, I guess I'm having lemonade. Hey, are you okay? What? Yeah. Here you go. Thank you. - You guys want to go? - Yeah. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Are you okay? What happened? No, I'm fine. I'm good. I thought I was feeling better, but I guess I'm not. - Thank you. - You don't look good. No, no, I'm good. I feel better. I threw up. - I'm gonna take you home. - No, no, you guys are having... No, Becca, you guys are having a good time. I feel fine. Seriously, I'm gonna go... I'm gonna take you home. Becca, I'm gonna go find Mom and Dad. - I'm good. I just want to... - Are you sure? Yeah, I'm good. You guys have fun. What? Why the fuck are you doing this? I... I don't know what you want, but please just... just let me go. It's fine. What? What is this? What are you doing? Shit. Oh, God. What is that? What the... what the fuck are you doing? Please. Help! Please, God. Please help me. What are you doing? What the hell is this? Help! Please, God, help me! Please. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Please help. I don't know what this is, but can you... can you... can you please just untie me? I didn't do anything. Oh, please. Please, I didn't do anything. Oh, please. With my blood, the gate is open. This is Your servant, Lord. We commend her immortal soul to Your everlasting care. What's happening? Her body may become the vessel for His work. - In her death, may we have life. - Please. Please. - In her suffering... - Help! ...may we have peace. Somebody please hear me! Amen. Come forth and claim your offering. No. No. No. No. No! - Shh. - Shush. Get your sweater. Let's go, honey. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Jimmy, Jimmy, shh, shh, shh. Come on, let's go. Come on, now. No, now. - Hey, everybody, come on. - Shh. Dan. Dan, Wendy. Honey. - Mary, what's wrong? - What happened? What happened to you? - She was sitting by herself. - What? Sweetie, go get your sister. We gotta go. - Dan, we need to go. - Becky! - Tell her... - She'll be all right. Just get her home. Get her to bed. - Honey. - Honey, are you all right? Are you okay? I have to tell you something. What? - Becca. Becky. - What? I think Mary's sick. Mom wants you. What happened? I don't know. She doesn't look good though. Come on, let's go. I understand. Go ahead. - Come on, you guys. - What happened? - What happened? - Honey. She was supposed to be with you. She's not feeling well. It's fine. She'll be all right. She's just not feeling very well. All right, sweetie. Let's just get her upstairs. Watch your brother. Hey, let's watch TV. Hello. Dad, it's for you. Um, okay. Come on, sweets. Almost there. Hello. Oh. Is there any way we could do it tomorrow? Okay. Understood. Okay Who was that? I have to go to the church. What, now? What for? I don't know. Kingsman said that he needed me. At this hour? You can't go now. He knows your daughter's sick. Yeah, he said that it was important. - Honey, I don't... - How is she? She's not well. She's sweating a lot. She doesn't have a fever. I don't know what it is. Okay. It shouldn't be long, all right? Hello? Hello? Pastor Kingsman? Ahem. Pastor Kingsman. Are you okay? I had to get you away from there. It needs time. Not much, but it needs time. I'm afraid that I'm not following. I don't know what needs time and what I'm supposed to get away from. Yes, Dan, you are. You are following. You are following His will. You are a good man, Dan. You are such a good man. And I am so sorry. I'm so sorry that this has to happen to your family, to you. Oh, your poor daughter. She is so young.

Pastor Kingsman? Kingsman is just the keeper. He is just doing what he was asked to do. This place is a doorway, and on the other side is evil. We were picked to be a part of this great, big plan that we have no control over. All I know is that once the doorway is open, we have one job, and one job only... to shut it. I'm sorry. I'm trying to save you. Please trust me. You have to get back in the car and we have to go right now. Get in the car! - Christopher! - Help! Help! Help! - Christopher, she's coming. - Help!

He's doing what God has asked us to do. We must close the gate and end this, or else darkness will subdue the light and the world will become his. It's the way it's always been. There is no other way. We must close the gate.
