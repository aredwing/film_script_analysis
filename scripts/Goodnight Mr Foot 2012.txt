A witch's brew for me and you With goblin poo and pig slop goo A hotel guest? To serve and uphold the comfort of each guest. To strive for perfection in guest hospitality. These are the bylaws of the Hotel Transylvania as written by its manager and founder, Count Dracula. Pardon me, your guestship. But will you be needing anything? The poor dear, all tuckered out like a wee baby. What a horrible draft. He'll surely catch death of a cold. Hey, broom. Broom. Hey, broom. Hey! That spider will wake him for sure. You're dead, pesky noisemaker.
