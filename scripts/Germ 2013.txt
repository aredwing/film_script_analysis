I hope you're here to frisk me. Well, service is half our motto. Don't they prohibit you from corrupting young girls? I'm pretty sure you've already been corrupted. (HELICOPTER) (RADIO STATIC) Hell of a thing. Billion dollars to put it up in the sky, 60 million to bring it back. Are we still confirmed for launch time? No sir, it's been pushed back to 0-800. Well, you can tell them that Recovery is still ready and waiting for the sky to fall. Yes sir. I'll be in rover two if you need me. (HELICOPTER) (RADIO STATIC) Sir, control is ready to launch. About time. Inform control that rover is ready and waiting. Control indicates firing in ten, nine... I'll just read it off the screen, Sarge. Eight... I'll just read it off the screen. (EXPLOSION) (ALARM BEEPING) Sir, we have a deviation... Say again? The satellite is off-plane. Control is aborting the launch. Screens are not showing anything. All right, back it up and show me the past few seconds of footage. Doesn't appear to be military, sir. Could be a meteor. Plot the target's new trajectory and point of impact. I've been thinking a lot about what you said. I just don't get it. You love me. I love you... I like you a lot, Max. Just... love? I'm not even sure what that is. Brooke. We agreed on just friends. If you can't handle that, then this is just gonna have to stop. I'm just trying to... Yeah, I know you're trying, all right? But... I also know how I feel. And until I feel differently, this is just how it has to be. Okay? So... How's it gonna be? Well, I'm not giving you up. So I guess I'll stick with this then. I just... I just don't want to keep having the same conversation. Yeah, I... I get it, all right? And mum's the word. (SIGHS) Man. You're a hard woman to love. I know. See you later then? It is a small town. Ouch. (LAUGHS) Be careful. Watch out for bears. And lions and tigers. (SIGHS) Supposed to be good weather. That's good news. Steph's been working so hard on that merit badge. I'd hate for her to come home empty handed. Ah, she'll do fine rain or shine. Brooke still out on her run? She left before sunrise. You know that girl is gonna get hurt if she keeps running at night. She's been running in those woods forever. She knows where all those mines are, yours included. (FOOTSTEPS) About time you got up. Daylight's a wastin'. I'd have been up sooner if you had a phone in this place. That's your answer for everything. Get a phone and you'll stop hearing it. Where you heading today? Thought I'd head up to the gorge. Some good deadfall up there. Plus, the burnout will be good for the seedlings. Well, if it stays clear we'll use the mares and bring it all on home. Sounds good to me. See y'all later. (JET PLANE) (RADIO SIGNALS) There go the fuel tanks. Get the team wheels up. I want best speed for Preacher's Mill. Inform HOUSTONE we'll survey the wreckage and extract whatever's left. And tell the local fire crews to hang back until we get there. The last thing we need is for some short order cook to get a face full of hydrazine. Hey, Dad. Hey, good morning, Brooke. How was your run? Good. You about ready to go? Steph is going crazy with the wait. Yeah, I'll be just a sec. BROOKE: Hi, Mom. Hi, sweetheart, how was the run? Good. Your Dad and Steph are waiting on you. Yeah, I know. Dad already told me. You almost ready? You ready to kicksome Forestal butt? It's just a camp-out. Yeah, well, hope you're rested up. Mrs. Brewer tells methat your campsite is almost two milesfrom the parking lot. Two miles through the spooky woods. (LAUGHS) Ah, went the littlegreen frog one day and it all went mmm ah mmm Oh, yeah. La dee da dee da, la dee da dee da Ia dee da dee da, and we all know frogs Go la dee dolly olly, they don't go mmm ah mmm (BOOMING) Did you hear that? What? Something. No. (BELL RINGING) Morning, Green! Green! Morning, Stu. How can we help you today? Ah, little bit of weighing, little bit of trade? (PHONE BEEPING) You know cell service is down? Probably something you did. Why'd we give you that badge again? Won it off the Sheriff in a poker game. (DOOR BEEP) (DOOR BEEP) Did you hear something earlier? I heard this big boom. It sounded like... The sound of a satellite hitting the side of South Mountain? You're shitting me. (LAUGHS) The army says that there is or will be a hell of a fire, and that we should steer clear, although what they actually say is we should steer cle... Probably means that the communications equipment's nice and toasty right about now, hence the lack of cell phone service. Wonderful. According to this, the satellite still has over half its fuel left. Hydrazine. Hand me that book over there, would you? Thanks. You really think Miller can handle this kind of hazmat shit? I don't know about handling it, but they definitely need to get up there and check out that fire. They got all sorts of equipment and they don't use half of it. That reminds me. I gotta take the Chief's car to get an oil change. Flip you for the duty. (LAUGHS) Sorry, Davidson, only full-time deputies get to play games of chance. Enjoy your drive, though. While you're at it, stop out at Silver Springs, too, and warn them off. Yeah, I'll tell the hippies not to inhale any of the smoke. Just tell them to come down here if the fire heads their way. I'm gonna go ahead and take my lunch break out at Silver Creek. Hey, there's no lunch, Davidson! We've got a fire on our hands! (DOOR BEEPING) We're policemen, Max. We handle crimes. Firemen handle fires. (DOOR BEEPING) Fine. Be back here in an hour and a half or so regardless. You have my word as a physician and part-time deputy. Hey! Watch those bootlegger turns. Chief says you keep it up those tires will be coming out of your pay. What is the point of being a lawman if you can't break the law? (PHONE DIALING) (BUSY TONE) Chrissy, I mean, seriously, your mom and dad haven't even been gone for five minutes and you're already... Hey! You got everything? Yep. Okay then, you two crazy girls CHRISSY: I will! STEPH: We will! I'll bring her back on Sunday. That'd be great, but no need to rush. I'm going over to Chad's for the weekend. Gotcha. Sunday afternoon it is. (DOOR SLAM) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) (ENGINE STARTING) Chrissy, are you sure you should be eating that much? Aren't you supposed to go hiking as part of this trip? But I'm hungry and my mom said I could have some while she's gone. She said you could have the whole box? Steph, sweetie, I don't want you eating a bunch, okay? I won't. STEPH: Gross! BROOKE: Great. All right. You all set? Yup. Okay. There's no reason to be scared, sweetie, okay? You've got your whole troupe here. I'm not scared. It's going to be fun. Great. I'll meet you right back here on Sunday, okay? And we'll go for some ice cream. Ugh. Okay. Maybe not ice cream. Bye. CHILDREN: Stephanie! Hi, Stephanie! Hi! GIRL 1: Hey, you can't get me! GIRL 2: You just got me! (GIGGLING) BROOKE: All right, Chrissy, homeward bound. DYKES: Tell you what, Cap. If this is another false alarm, I'm gonna hit somebody with my fucking Halligan. Fantastic. We've got a job to do. (SIGHS) Holy shit. Wow. (SIGHS) Are we gonna call the park service for this? Power's out. What the hell is this? It's all fucking shitty. Oh, yeah. (LAUGHING) (HORN HONK) (CAR DOOR SLAM) Okay? Hey! CHAD: So, d'ya hear about the fire? No. Chrissy? She ate a bunch of sweets and threw up. We weren't in the camping mood after that. KIM: I told you not to eat all that stuff. Do you mind if I drop her here with you? No, that's okay. Fine. Fine. Come on, piglet. Let's get you a place to sit. What was that about the fire? Ah, up on South Mountain. Some wildfire or something. Best ask your boyfriend. I just play here. Yo, where's that ball? Okay. Bye-bye. Ball, please. BROOKE: Deputy? Ma'am? So, do you have any plans for dinner? Well, I'm supposed to have dinner with this guy I know. Oh. He's in law enforcement. Well, if it's the chief, I think I've got some ass-kicking to do. (LAUGHS) And if it is, I think you have a daddy complex, little girl. Oh? (LAUGHS) What's up with the fire? Steph's out camping, you know? Yeah, they're, all the Forestals, they're out at Silver Lake, you know that. The fire's nowhere near there. So, I got Miller and his team checking it out right now. They're digging some firebreaks and other than that we're just supposed to wait until the feds show up. The feds? Oh, yeah, the fire was actually started by this satellite that they were trying to shoot down or something and it fell out of orbit and crash landed in beautiful, scenic Preacher's Mill. What are the odds, right? Yeah, really. So, they're supposed to send out some HAZMAT team or something and until then we're just supposed to steer clear. Wow. Yeah, wow. First the iron ore runs out and now shit's falling from the sky. You'll keep an eye on it, right? In case the fire shifts? Hey, your sister and her whole coven of Forestals are gonna be fine. Long as I run this town. So they're solid until Tuesday, 'cause that's when the chief gets back. Well, I'll see you tonight, then. Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT) (CHAINSAW) Okay, guys, listen up. The feds are gonna be here shortly, tomorrow morning, so we don't need any heroes. Go ahead and dig your breaks and then back off, okay? Yeah. Okay. Has anybody actually been up to the tower yet? We just came from the tower. Whole fucking thing'sburning up there. I don't know how you guys deal with this shit. Beats the hell out of giving out enemas. Jeez, Edwards, I told you to take a break! MANAGER: Is he gonna be okay? I don't know. Looks like he's got heat stroke. (BELL RINGING) Hey, you almost ready? I'm gonna ride back. What, all the way? That's uphill, you know. I know. The race is, like, two weeks out. Steph all right? I think so. She's got your love for the woods. (LAUGHS) Did you hear about that fire? Yeah, the winds are blowing westward. Shouldn't be a problem for you if you stay on the east loop. Okay. Will do. You home for dinner? Oh. Max is cooking. What, are you leading that boy on? See you tomorrow. Love you. (CAR SPUTTERING) Need a push? Ha, ha. (LAUGHS) Shit. (ROMANTIC MUSIC) (HEAVY BREATHING) (POWER OUTAGE) Ugh. Aw. What the fuck? KIM: Shh. You're gonna wake up Chrissy. (LAUGHS) Well, so much for that. How about this? Why don't you go start the generator? Oh, what for? We've got fire. You got fire. Well, that's all true, but the house doesn't, and unless you start it, guess who's gonna be sleeping with us? Ugh! Fine! I'll go see if I can find a flashlight somewhere or something. Sexy. There's one in the kitchen closet, I think. (DOOR CLOSING, BUMP) Motherfucker! (RATTLING) (OBJECT BREAKING) (OBJECT SHATTERING) (SCREAM) (FOOTSTEPS) What is it, sweetheart? (WHIMPERING) What happened? Did you have a scary dream? What happened? There's a monster outside. What? There's a monster outside! He's trying to get in. CHAD: Okay, okay, okay. All right, all right, listen up. You two juststay where you are. Don't want him coming in here. It's okay. Nothing's out there. You just had a scary dream, that's all. Uh-uh. Hey, motherfucker, anybody out there? Best be leaving or I'll call the cops! It's quiet out here. Too quiet. Yo, bitches, come get some! Fucker! Work! Chad? Chad! Chad, this isn't funny. Chad? Chad? Chad? Chad? Chad, where are you? (CLICKING) (SCREAMING) (SIRENS) Holy shit. MAX: Davidson? In here! So... how are things going on this end? I've got good newsand I've got bad news. How much have you had to drink today? That's probably the bad news. So, give me the good news, then. I've got your cause of death. Mm-hmm. All right. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated and no major organs remaining. Massive tissue loss across the entire musculature of the body, maybe 70 percent. And most of the head, the right hand, the right leg, portions of the sternum and ribs, fragments of the pelvis still intact. All of it largely denuded of tissue. Postmortem lacerations and abrasions indicate all the typical hallmarks of non-frenzied feeding. So, it was a bear attack, then. This was no bear. (MENACING MUSIC) Bite marks. Well, duh. Human bite marks. What? Human. Bite marks. Struck him down and ate him up. Some... A person did this! Yup. Oh, my God. Do you think it was Kim? Kids these days. I'm gonna go. Yeah, yeah. The moose, the moose, the moose, the moose Swimming in the water, swimming in the water The moose, the moose, the moose, the moose COOPER: Hell of a fire, Sarge! COOPER: That'll do it! MAX: We need to talk about last night. Sure. What was it? A bear attack? What makes you think it was a bear? What do you mean? What else would it be? That's where we need your help. Sure. DAVIDSON: Okay, Kim. Now, this is a gelatin mold, I just want you, it's gonna be a little warm I want you to go ahead and put it in your mouth and you'll bite down evenly. Wait a minute! What's going on here? It's all standard procedure in a case like this. For a bear attack? I know it seems a little strange, but... KIM: Whoa. You think... you think I ate him? Oh, my God! Now, Kim, please, we're just trying to... What the fuck are you saying? I think I'm gonna get sick! What's that? A bucket for my vomit? For my vomit, right? To check my vomit. Because you think I ate him? Fine! I'll take your test. Just get it over with! Okay, Kim. Just go ahead and put it in your mouth, bite down evenly. All right. That's it. That's it? You're not gonna arrest me? Well, we do have to hold you here until we get the results back. I want you to tell me now! You think I ate him? I want you to know now! I don't think it's a match. Jesus Christ! Kim... I'm really sorry about all this, but we had to be... Is there anything else? No. Good. Then kindly fuck off! Come on, Chrissy, let's go. Come on. You know, Hardy Boys, if it wasn't a bear attack, and it wasn't me, then what was it? Kim! God damn it. Okay. That's the other bad news. What's that? There were multiple bite patterns on the kid's body, all right? There's more than one killer, more accurately, more than one eater. You got to be kidding me. (CLEARS THROAT) There's one other thing. His hypothalamus was extremely enlarged. So? It's still growing. Almost exponentially. Even though he's dead? Even though he's dead. Look, you're the doc here, but isn't that a bit unusual? Of the body that continue to grow after death, but the hypothalamus is usually not one of them, all right? So, I've done a little digging and I found something interesting going on, all right? Don't you need permission for that? Okay, you know the drill. We move out in 20 towards the impact crater. If you see any of the locals, get a check on conditions, then check back with me. Get any spikes in your meters, and you pull back double quick. Other than that, it's bag it and tag it, and we can go home. Damn, it's hot out. Gonna be like hell today. MAX: Ugh. You pulled this out of Chad's head? (RADIO CHATTER) I don't know what that means. (CLEARS THROAT) Okay. I've never seen anything like that, all right? It's structure is, frankly, alien. Alien, like, foreign? No, alien, like as in alien. As in not from around here, as in Earth. What? Okay. There are hypotheses about the possibility of germs from space landing on a planet, okay? Galactic pan-spermia, for example. And nobody really pays much attention to them, they've largely been discredited, but technically, hypothetically, it is conceivable that a non-terrestrial micro-organism could, in fact, survive re-entry, land on a planet surface where it could... Find Chad. What are the odds of that? About the same as that of a satellite hitting South Mountain, I would say. You think the satellite brought this in with it? Ask the military, man, it's their satellite. I mean, okay, look. In Chad's case, the cells are hyper-replicating, all right? His hypothalamus is growing and putting a tremendous amount of pressure on the rest of his brain. What effect would that have? It's hard to say. I mean, I'm out of my depth here, man. I mean, the hypothalamus governs body temperature, thirst, hunger, aggression, all kinds of stuff. Look, until the HAZMAT guys get here, the best I can say is maybe we just keep our eyes peeled for anybody with symptoms and hope that it's not readily transmittable. What about the people who ate him? Do you think they're infected? Your guess is as good as mine when it comes to alien bacteria, man. (RADIO FUZZ) Preacher's Mill Police? Hey man, this is Mike. I'm out at Silver Lake and I've kind of got a problem. MAX: Oh, yeah? What's that? Yeah, believe it or not, but there's a pack of fucking wild dogs out here. (LAUGHING) (SCREAMING) What the fuck? (GROWLING) (ROCK MUSIC) All right, something works in this car. (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (GROWLING) (BANGING) Holy... JACK: Mom! (GROWLING) JACK: Mom! Jack? JACK: Mom, get the gun! Jack? Jack? JACK: Get the fucking gun! (GROWLING) Mom, get the fucking gun! Shoot him! Shoot him, God damn it! (GUNSHOT, SCREAMS) (GROWLING) Get away! (SCREAMS) (GUNSHOT) (SCREAMING) (WORKOUT MUSIC) (SHUFFLING MUSIC) (GROWLING) What happened? Karen? (CRYING) Karen, what happened? He's gone! My boy! What happened? He's gone. Who did this? Karen, who did this? What is him? I don't know! He came out of the woods. And he was chasing Jack. And he said get the gun. And I got the gun. And he killed him right here with his bare hands. And then he tried to eat him! What? He tried to eat him! Karen, Karen, baby, baby, slow down. Shh. Don't shush me! I know what I saw! And he tried to eat him! It's okay, darlin. It's okay, baby. Stu! Who are those people? Hey! Get the fuck off my land! (GASPING) (SCREAMING) Get in the house! Get in, now! Shit, man. They really went to town. Saved me a beer, though. Mike? What's up? Who's that? Hmm? Jesus. Hey, man, are you all right? (SCREAMING) Hey, whoa! Whoa! Dude! Hold it! Get it off me! (SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) Step away from the car! I said step away from the car now! (SCREAMING) Stop or I'll shoot! (GUNSHOTS) Don't look outside. Don't look outside. (YELLING) Shit! Shit! Oh shit! Goddamn. (YELLING) Mike? Mike? Mike, oh my God! Mike! Miss. Oh, Jesus. (DISTANT LAUGHTER) Come on. Come on! Get in the car! Lock the doors! Are you okay? Are you hurt? I cut myself on the door. Shit. Use this. Buckle up! Who are those people? What do they want? Hold on. What do they want? Hold on! (GROWLING) Reload! Come on, baby! (SCREAMING, GLASS SHATTERING) (SCREAMING) Sweet Jesus! Brooke! Brooke! Get back in the house now! Dad? STU: Reload, baby! Come on, baby. What's going on? Who are these people? Get up the stairs. Was there a gun? No, I don't think so. (BANGING) (GROWLING) What is wrong with these people? I don't know, but they're attacking! Daddy, what are we gonna do? Go to the window! But what about you and Mom? We'll be fine! The fall would break our legs. Now, you start runningand don't you look back! I need you to do this for me and your Mom! KAREN: It'll be okay, baby. It'll be okay. Karen! It's gonna be okay, ma'am. I'm gonna take you to the doc, and it's gonna be... Ma'am? Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm gonna take you to the doc and he's gonna... Ma'am, are you okay? (GROANING) (VOMITING) (SCREECHING TIRES) (YELLING, GLASS SHATTERING) (GRUNTING) (COOPER) What the fuck? (YELLING) Hey! Hey! (SCREAMING) Hey. Hey, are you okay? Hey, are you okay? (SCREAMING) Jesus! Jesus! Look, is that a deer? (SCREAMING) No! No! Stop! Oh, my God! Mrs. Brewer! (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (YELLING) No! No! No! (YELLING) (RUPTURING) (GROWLING) (DISTANT YELLING) (GASPING) Is that the cavalry on the way? (DISTANT YELLING) No. There's people, but they've... gone crazy or something. They've definitely done that. Or something. Where are the rest of your people? I don't know. (YELLING) This isn't gonna work if you don't help. You want help? My team's vehicles are up on the road by the Silver Springs Resort. Satellite phone is inside. Dial alpha alpha three delta bravo. Wait, wait, wait. Alpha alpha delta... Alpha alpha three, alpha alpha, oh, fuck it. It's just pain. Let's go. (GRUNTING) Okay, okay. I'm gonna need a lot of your help. I'll be the help if you kill anything that comes at us. Okay? Deal? (DISTANT GUNSHOT) Okay. If any of those fuckers get by, you leave me and go, deal? Let's just get to that phone. (GROANING) (SCREAMING) (RUPTURING) (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (DISTANT SCREAMING) (DISTANT SCREAMING) (DISTANT GUNSHOT) (DISTANT SCREAMING) (DISTANT GUNSHOTS) Stephanie? Steph? Steph? Are you okay? Are you hurt? Come on out of there, sweetheart. Come on. It's okay. I'm here. Oh, come here. I gotcha. I gotcha. Steph, what are you doing out here? They tore Mrs. Brewer's arm off. Shh, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Can you stand? Yeah, I got it. Get their weapons! To the truck. (DISTANT SCREAMING) There's no phone in here! Check the other truck! (DISTANT YELLING) (GUNSHOTS) (GUNSHOTS) (GUNSHOT) What's the number? Alpha alpha three delta bravo alpha alpha. (DIALING) (BUSY SIGNAL) (DISTANT SCREAMING, DIALING) (DISTANT SCREAM) (DISTANT SIREN) Okay, Steph. I'll be right back, okay? Just, lock the doors and don't open them for anybody except for me. And you know what? Even if it is me, only open it if I knock three times, okay? How many times am I gonna knock, Steph? Three. Three. That a girl. (LOCKING CAR) (DOOR BEEP) Max? Did you get them dogs? Man, I am really hungry. You got anything to eat? Jesus. Davidson, what happened? Oh, alien virus one, Preacher's Mill zero. I got some people locked up in the... the cage there, shot some others out here. I got whatever it is unless this is the worst case of pollen outbreak in history. Oh, I let the girls go. Seemed the thing to do under the circumstances. (DOOR BEEP) Make it stop! Make it stop! Make it stop! (YELLING) It burns! It burns! It burns! Get it out! (CRYING) Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!

Roll the window down, baby. Put the window down! Put the window down! I can't, Daddy! I can't. Okay. Try the key in the ignition Give it a turn. Give it a turn. That's it! That a girl! That a girl! That's right. Right there. Hurry! (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) Come on. Come to me. Don't even look at him. Don't worry about him, sweetheart. Don't look at him! Don't look at him, sweetheart! Come on, baby. I gotcha. I gotcha. I gotcha. I gotcha. Oh God. (DISTANT YELLING) (GUNSHOTS) (BRANCH SNAPPING) (DISTANT YELLING) (GUNSHOT) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (GUNSHOT) (GROANING) (INFECTED) Somebody, please. Please. (THUMP) (COUGHS) (GRUNTING) DAVIDSON: About the same as that of a satellite hitting South Mountain, I would say. BROOKE: Until I feel differently, this is just how it has to be. (THUMP) Whoa! (GRUNTING) God, motherfuckers! (SCREAMING) Come on! BROOKE: I knew you were alive. MAX: Are you okay? BROOKE: Yeah. (GUNSHOTS) MAX: You don't know how much it means to me to see you safe. BROOKE: I wanted to be with you. (YELLING) (GUNSHOT) BROOKE: Why won't you let me back there? MAX: I got whatever this is. And I don't knowhow long I can control myself. You know. Your father's alive. Steph is too. They left herea little while ago, headed towards Ashland. As far as I could tell anyway. BROOKE: Max! Oh, my God, Max. Brooke? Use the front door. The front door! I knew you were alive. I love you, Brooke. You're my everything. You're my stars. My moon. My whole world. Max. I'll always love you, even after I'm gone. I just hope that you can take this ring as a token of my love. Damn it. You know, it's been kind of one of those days, huh. Well, it'll be back here for you when I'm gone. Max. I love you. (DISTANT SCREAM) I love you. (BANGING) I'd tell you to run for help, but I don't think the odds are in your favor at this point. The entire valley's in quarantine. They told me I just had to stay put. And of course you didn't. I was looking for you. I came out here looking for you! Well, if you're up for a challenge, grab one of those guns up front. Maybe we can get these people to listen to reason. (INTENSE BANGING) (GLASS BREAKING) Go! (GUNSHOTS) (GUNSHOTS) MAX: Brooke!
