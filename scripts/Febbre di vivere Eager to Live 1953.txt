He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made. And then, I won't pay them. How silly! How much did you pay? - Nothing. I gave back the other, plus some IOU's. - What a car! You paid 3 million for the other. Why give it away? Wasn't good? With green leather, for a week nothing went good. It's no use, green brings him the jinx! You leaving? - Can't you see? And me? Do what you want. See you at the "Capriccio". Right window. Listen! Look... To speak to the prisoners. Take a seat. We'll call. - I've been sent by... Wait for your turn. But I have to talk urgently to Daniele Massa. - Wait with the others! But... - Di Denanzio Luigia. - Here I am! Peretti Michelina... - Here. May I? Massimo Fontana! You had a meeting with Daniele Massa? Yes. He was released. When? This morning. He went out this morning. - Thanks. - Nothing. One coffee. Miss? Is there lawyer Passamonti? I'm Fontana, is urgent. Listen, Passamonti, Daniele Massa got out this morning. What shall I do? I understand. Yes. Don't worry, I'll call you back. Come on, stop that. By now you should know Massimo. Grant him an occasional flirt! - Stop it, Sandro! What is it, Elena? Anything wrong? Why don't you tell me? - Never mind. I believe that... I'm expecting a baby. No! Well done! And Massimo? Swear you won't tell him! - He doesn't know? - No. Don't tell him, got it? Sure I can't picture Massimo with a baby! Great! You could launch the trend. You know it can't be noticed? What should be noticed, silly? I'm not sure yet! Remember not to wear tight belts. Poor Elena, you're in a mess. - Why? He'll marry me, he loves me. I was joking! Massimo is a great guy. You'll see, everything will be fine. Where did he go? Why hasn't he come? - Don't know, must have had to do. Try and call him. - He won't be home. - Try! Alright! Is it you? Leave me alone. It's open! Daniele! I came to see you, earlier. Three years! And you come when I'm released? Why, do you think it's easy? They give permits only to relatives. I tried! - Come or not come, I don't give a damn! I've spent three years in jail because of you! Me? Are you mad? Say, are you mad? By God! You know what it's like, 3 years in jail? And if I ever deserved the jail, all the more this holds for you! But you were here, like a lord! See how you're settled? Cause I didn't come to keep you company? - But it's me who went to jail. The naive! And I've lost my money with your scams! You cheated me! You fucked me over! You've been so coward. But at the beginning we were lucky. - Sure! I had trusted you, the friend. I went through a lot of trouble! Take a look. If I wasn't here to fix... Fixed what? How many times I wrote you from jail? You're right, but how could I explain by letter? Look here. Realize by yourself! Bullshit! All lies! - Will you let me talk? You've always told lies! Are you tired? - No, why? Mom always says that when pregnant... - Don't be stupid, Sandro. Stop it. Mommy,.. where are you going now? To rest. - At your home or at his home? His. - But he's not there! So you say! - I told you! No one answered. As if you didn't know! If he's with people he cares about, he won't answer. He did it many times, even with me there. Elena, you won't have the complex of the seduced and abandoned? Poor Massimo, is so faithful as to arouse pity. Believe me, I always was close to you. When all was well and when all went wrong. I even took a loss! We raced too much, if you want, but you got into trouble all by yourself. Let's be fair: if it had gone well, the money would be yours. It went wrong... As indeed to almost all limited companies come out after the war. It was a gust. Don't drink so on an empty stomach. You're no longer accustomed, I guess. I am no longer accustomed to anything. This bed seems so soft that it bothers me. I went to eat at a trattoria. - But... why didn't you come straight here? I was hoping for a miracle. I wanted to first see a person. But the miracle did not happen. I've been in a trattoria. I can't even stay at a table with cutlery and tablecloth. Say, want my advice? We'll talk business tomorrow. Now I'll fix you a nice bath. Wait! I'll give you the royal treatment. This is an English cologne so extraordinary that I regret using it. But you can't stay dressed like that. Pick something to wear. The jackets... will barely fit you. No! There! This should fit. Come on, get moving. Then we'll do something. We'll pick some pretty girls. Come on, Daniele, get moving! The water is warm. Or you want it cold? And then, take a shower. And since you had the good sense to not to, you'll see the lawyer tomorrow. And then, tomorrow we'll bicker again. I too got my wrongs, mind you, but, you'll see that I couldn't do otherwise. What could you wear? Do you prefer... a shirt or a tee? Your pick. You're there! Obviously. Maybe, I should have knocked. Or rather not come, right? - Yeah! Bye! Stupid! Daniele, show up. Or you'll be killed by a jealous girl who thinks you're a Swedish dancer. So you'll learn to be jealous. Sorry, I thought you had called me. - Indeed. This is Elena, my girlfriend. Come on up. You present me in this state? And Sandro? - Down in the carriage. He was afraid of a scene. Shall I call him? - No. - How do I turn off here? - Daniele! Want to meet a guy named Sandro? Well... To me, the sea brings melancholy at night. To you not? If you stayed 3 years on an island, you'll have enough of the sea! - It was an island without a sea. Massimo! Your friend is totally plastered! He's so nice! Giuliana, how do you feel? Hey, what are we doing still here? - We're having fun. Think that tomorrow I must get up early. Rehearsal is at 11. - Oh, yes? Too bad he didn't come back earlier. Don't you think he would be perfect for the scene on neo-realism? You know how to act? - I? - But, yes, of course, you! People off the road are fashionable today. Everyone knows acting. Why? You know how to act? - Perfectly! I found out it's very easy. But next time they must pay us the costume or I won't agree. Mine cost me 100,000. Why? Who should pay for it? The abandoned infancy? - It would be an idea. But, wouldn't be simpler if, instead of doing a play, you gave directly to charity its cost? You're crazy. And who's got 100,000 lire? But if you spent it for the dress! You're so stupid, Elena! - I may be stupid... But how lazy you are! We took a wonderful walk. Really? Bravo Marcel! "Under the wide and the starry sky!" Now I remember where we met. You were with Massimo, about What's with him? Always silent. One doesn't know what to say. A handsome guy like that. You like him, huh? - Imagine! Must be mal d'Afrique. He's just back and has not yet acclimatized. Will have nostalgia for black women! - But aren't you cold? Watch out! Penalty. It's a rotten jinx, it is. I won! I'll get it back at the racing hall, you'll see! That's what I want. - You're so damn lucky! Boss, bring some more whiskey! Pays Pierr! Look, if you get drunk like last night, I'll leave you here. In the colonies they drink a lot, right? I don't know, ma'am. I haven't been in Africa. I was in prison. Is he drunk or serious? Come on, Simona! "Being in Africa" always meant... What? My husband spent 2 years in Africa, during Ethiopia. - In jail? Really in jail? - Nice friends you got, Massimo! You know what? I'd love to go for a fortnight in prison. Can you tell me how he made it? - He killed his wife. You're so funny! It really was for a mess, for a trifle. Giuliana, let's go for a walk. No, thanks. Let's go to bed. Simona, you think of nothing else! That's a good one! Look, we won't be a lot of fun, but better than this mosquito! Come on. What's wrong? Lucia... It was Lucia Riva. You remember her? Three years since I heard her voice. - Lucia... Of course I remember! As a boy, down at the Aniene. Why? Did you see her again, after? I always continued to see her. We were almost engaged. It's her that I went to look this morning. The miracle you were expecting! - Massimo! What are you doing? Shall we go? You're a romantic. That's why you didn't even look at her. Daniele! Can't you see what a girl? Look, I will be fatuous, a scoundrel, whatever you want, but at least in this field I can give good advice. The girls are all beautiful, pleasing, generous... Right, Lisey? - What's with you, Massimo? I'm going with her. - I'm going here. - You want me? - And me? You go with her, then. - All right. - Let's go, quick! Don't get lost on the road, huh? - All roads lead to Rome! You're thinking about someone? - No. Yes. Let's go on the beach. I'm not thinking about anyone, and I should think of someone. If you like to tell me, tell me about. The girl, I mean. So much the better. Watch! A shooting star. Had time to think of a wish? Don't think about it. They earn a lot, I'm telling you. That is, those who manage honestly. There is Mr. Massa with a gentleman. Let them in. I was awaiting you. But where were you last night? You saw what it is here? It takes a cool head. Lawyer Scotillo. - Nice meeting you. Come in, come in. Please, lawyer. We need some clarification. At the trial, lawyer Passamonti, who defended Mr. Massa, and who seems to have been chosen just by you, has glossed over some points that would have helped my client. Excuse me a moment. A drink? - No. - Three coffee, sugar separately. How much the Prize Ercolano? - 71 winner, 24 runner-up. Sorry. You were saying? Mr. Massa gave me the precise task to represent him for all the aftermath of his painful question. I'm carefully examining the dossier. Meanwhile, I'm asking you to immediately liquidate the amount of all withdrawals you made from the "Massa & C: Import-Export" before the arrest of Mr. Massa. Which ones? - You did everything without consulting me. At the inquiry I even had to recognize as my own your forged signature on a check. I did all in the common interest. You've pushed my client to commit a series of crimes, not only of monetary nature, but even fraud, embezzlement, for which he paid off with imprisonment. I see you're not aware of the facts. Otherwise I should define your conduct with a very grave word. You're here as lawyer of Daniele Massa? - Of course. I prefer to put you in touch with my lawyer. - I don't think so. There are many things to be clarified. - Mr. Fontana? We'd better meet in a more suited place. Wait, Daniele. I'll see you at the office. - Okay, good morning. I'm sick and tired of this whole story! You can't resolve these matters with lawyers. I owe you money, I know, I admit. - So, give it to me. - I'm broke! What little I have, is engaged here. I have no money. What can I do? I manage this racing hall, a trade that can make good. Come work with me, we associate! - Muretto lost. - You mean? I offer you what I have, a good deal. - I don't like your deals. So go back to your lawyer, do as you wish. Stupid me to waste time. This way, please. - I'm taking care of you as a brother. I even went to beg Lucia. What? Who authorized you? Think for a moment before mingling with lawyers. You think it's a bad deal? Stay here, realize. - Where did you see Lucia? Doesn't she work at the radio? I went there and I invited her for tonight. We were friends, right? This is Mario and this is Filippo. My Janissaries. Mario, check what's the news from Milan. Be right back. Hey! Call the RAl immediately. Ask where I can find Miss Lucia Riva. Hurry up. You know what? I don't care! This is my 10,000 bet and I want my money! No use getting angry, sir. It's not up to me, I told you, I... I'm sorry, sir, but this is a regulation. Until I get reports with all the official results and the odds paid, I cannot give you the 813,000 of your martingale. Try tomorrow night. Yesterday it was today, now it's tomorrow. So, what game are we playing? - Hey, you! There is nothing to do. It's the rules. You need to wait the report. Don't worry. Tomorrow night. - Yes, tomorrow night. But, beware! You see, sir, the people that we must deal with. It takes patience! Hi, Daniele. - Hi. - Is there Massimo? No, I'll meet him at eight at Rosati's. - Bye. Excuse me. Hey! Listen... When you see him, tell him that came back the one he knows about. But this is not the way to handle a betting hall! Fontana cannot pocket all wagers. May come a mad bet that must be paid and there's no money. - Yes, alright. .. wife Concetta Russo, from Caserta, proudly announces the birth of an 8 Ibs son. Bye! - Goodbye. Lucia! Don't say you don't recognize me! I would cry. Massimo! Massimo, is that you? You won't maybe get kissed and hugged by all the guys who call you by name? Only yesterday I learned that you and Daniele... Daniele? Is out? - Yes. I'm happy for him. - He sought you. I didn't know you two... Well... - We two, what? - Well, nothing... That you two were dating. Later, at the age of reason. - You didn't know? No, I swear. As soon as I knew, here I am. Of course, I also come to plead for. Spare yourself. Tell me about yourself, rather. How many years have passed? - Many. You know, you're not much changed. - You are, luckily. Now I can tell you. You weren't very cute, as a child. Really true that "ugly in diaper, beautiful in frock. " Let's pretend that we met now and I'll give you another kiss, huh? You're not married, right? What fools, men! Engaged? - Not even. I get it, you think like me: freedom in love. No! You won't tell me you don't care? Where are you going? Shouldn't we go by Piazza Cavour? No errands. You know where we go? Close your eyes until I tell you. No, look Massimo, let's be clear. Don't be afraid, we're not going to Daniele. How it has changed! Your home is no longer visible, with all those buildings. - Which was yours? That one there, see? Since I left it, I did not stop anymore. A little here, a little there. Even in England, at a married aunt in Bristol. Look at our river! Remember when we wanted to set up an industry? Yes, it's true. Manufacture ink with... O God, I got stained. Look. And when you took off the dress to wash it at the river? How got angry, Daniele! He was jealous of me. He was right. See, Massimo... I want you to understand one thing. I have nothing against Daniele. I like him, and I'd also be happy to see him again. - So then? It's true that we were almost engaged. We were close friends, that's it. When he got arrested for that mess, just knowing that he had a circle all different from mine, that he had done some things, for which he could... I can't explain. We could return to be friends. Yeah! And then, maybe, from friendship... That's what I fear. Fear? Fear of falling in love? - Not at all. Fear of becoming affected. To start over something wrong. I see. I get it all. Like what? - That you're cold, calculating. I'm loyal. You wish that, for pity..? No, I don't want anything. You just want to be quiet, right? Sure. What's so unusual about that? So you won't meet Daniele. He's waiting at Rosati's. Nothing compromising, you know. There are other friends. No, I'm not coming. Would you explain to Daniele? When I've assured you that he won't bother you, that you can feel safe, then you'll descend from Olympus, right? Until that time, not even the Almighty will budge you. Massimo made me change opinion. I came. But I don't want you to think that my feelings towards you... What has happened has only helped me to understand. Believe me, I've been more stupid than guilty. I got involved in some bum deals. You like that girl? - Yes. Massimo? - Huh? We haven't met for many days. - Us? If you're always stuck to me like a leech! It's that I wish to stay a while with you, talk to you... Let's go away now. - Yes, yes, soon we leave. What the hell of dress are you wearing? - Why? You don't like? You look like a mule dressed for a party. But when will stop, that one? I can understand a flirt. But now Massimo is definitely disappointing us. Force us to endure a girl from Trastevere! See, Daniele, for me, for what concerns us, it matters little that you were innocent or not. It's not true. They're things that are said. - Forget it. Especially since, as I told you, nothing matters. Only the fact that... - That you don't love me. Not as you want. Couldn't it change? I think not. I've been thinking a lot. You don't want to leave me some hope? - Please, Daniele. You're right, sorry. Are you in love with someone else? - No. Today I seem to be only interrogated. Massimo already asked it all. Ask him, for information. I love you, Lucia. Tell me why in such a place, with nice music, they all sit silently at the table? They dance as for an unpleasant duty. You too, y'know? Not my idea of brilliant life. Come on, you don't want us to believe you're always homebound? - Not a chance. If I want to go dancing, I go dancing. But to dance! - Oh, imagine! Once, with a high school friend, we had in mind to do a dance marathon. She has the type of the marathoner! - Sure! I'm of those who wake people early to go hiking in the mountains. That's what he needs! - Why? You think that I...? One morning I woke him up at 9. He didn't speak to me for a week. - Guys! Rowing machine, got it? Well, because... In the morning, just wake up, 1, 2, 1, 2... Got it? And at some point, muscles! True, Simona? 'Morning, sir. - Hello Marco. Need anything? - No, thanks. Just a daisy. - Go ahead. Where do you think she dresses, Lucia? - Why? - Maybe she makes her own. Wasn't she sleek, last night? - Sure! She's a strange girl. - Oh, yes. She had a lot of fun. Like a little girl! She enjoys dance. You saw how she flings? - What now? - Give me a smoke. Here. Say, you know that you're acting badly with Elena? I? But what, you've got a crush on Elena? Go ahead if you wish, I'm weary of her. So good, so cute... but so boring! Elena is expecting a baby. - What? I'm telling you. That's why I feel sorry for her. Do not be silly, it's not true! And then, it's her problem. Imagine! She said it so as to soften you! Want 200,000? - What's with you? You want them? - So give me! - OK, listen. The risk is all mine. You know the life I do, what I spend, the debts I have, right? You know that just the racing hall overheads exceed 800,000. And you know there's always some 500,000 cash to cover the bets when it's bad. And you know that, all said and done, I always miss a penny. What should I do? - Let's go. We'll buy for a million IOU's. You sign them for a 4 months term, and I'll trade them at your father's name. Then... I give you the 200,000 lire, with the rest I do my own things, and before the term, I return the money to the loan shark, and give you back the bills, okay? - Easy to say! - Why? I owe you anything? No, but... what if you can't make it? - Come on, let's go! Damn loan shark! Tonight's program. Enough! I won't move from here. You've fooled me enough! I'm fed up! - Please, sir, calm down. Enough! I want the money, otherwise I'll break everything! It's the one of Agnano. There's the one of the race of Agnano, and won't listen to reason. We absolutely must pay him. And we've only got 50,000. What will you do? Don't know. And your partner? What about his capital? I don't make money, I! - Don't worry. Dear Fonzecchi, how are you? I'm Fontana. I wish I'd call you for some pretty chick, but sadly it's me who always needs you. The usual 8. At 12 hours. And then, perhaps, tonight I have a nice surprise for you. A surprise for you! Yes! At the races. I await you at once, thanks. Tell him to wait. It ever happened I left you in trouble? The first race has too many horses. The second I don't like. The third, we could do something. Close the door. Dick is favored. But Peter starts with advantage. If Baron and Arco don't let Dick pass,.. Peter wins easy. We bet half a million, we'll take one and a half. - OK. Baron is led by Rossi. How's with him? Piece of cake. Arco is led by Bero. You think he's game? - If the job is done neatly. - Of course! It seems we got it. Once we give 50,000 each to those two... Go immediately. Here's 100,000, hurry up! - Why do you say we have no money? There is Fonzecchi! - Let him in. Go away. Go, go, now! Fonzecchi dear, how are you? Come in, come in. So, 800,000 on the usual conditions. Until tonight. I want it cash and now. - Wait, it's.. - Cut it out, I can't wait! What does it mean to you? - 800,000? One million. For 12 hours? Then, no surprise. - You're a stinker. - I'll give it tonight, at the track. We agree, that's fine. You write me two lines? How many times did I turn to you? I've always returned. - Yes. - Look at me! I'm the kind to screw you? No, but some black on white... - Cut it out. Gimme the money and scram. Alright. There. It's 800,000. Count it. Tonight the surprise. How you doing, Rossi? Everything okay? What're you up to? - I get by. Want to call Bero? I must speak to you both. Go call Bero. Quickly. You'll admit it's ridiculous being told by a third party! You really needed to go...? - But I'm not sure yet! - Nice mess! I don't know how I got to tell Sandro. - Sandro my ass! I was miserable. I was... And you? You're so weird these days. - Now it's me the weirdo! You're not weird, huh? Trumpeting to the four winds... - But I only told Sandro. And Sandro is like a brother to me. Yes? - Is that you, Massimo? Say, are you crazy? Are you crazy? Why? The marathon's prize. The prize of the marathon? No, look, Massimo. I come to give it back. Maybe! Do come! I'm joking. Please, I enjoyed it. - I don't know what happened last night. I think I got pretty boozy. I'm not used. Maybe I said some nonsense, and you thought... No, there must be a misunderstanding. Please, let's meet. It was an evening so strange. All a strange day. I was glad to see you. I too was glad to see you. And I wanted to prove it. I'll call you tomorrow. No, I can't, I'm at the races with Daniele. It's not enough to turn me off. You know, after we forgot him last night. Well, then I'm coming too, OK? Really? I'll call you back. Alright, bye. Oh, no, no. Tragedy? What's there to cry, now? Nothing. Did I say anything maybe? - Come on, Elena! It was the girl from last night, right? I understood immediately. But I'll go to that girl, and I'll tell her everything! But, you got the craze to talk nonsense to people? Come on! What's going on? - Get off! Get off me! She's Daniele's girlfriend. I've met her after many years, okay? Or shall I bring written justification of my parents? We can't go on like this. Everyday a scene more stupid than the other. I'm in a dire situation. You get it? Do you understand that? If tonight I can't fix it, I'm in trouble indeed. But the young lady just thinks I don't devote her enough of my time! This is..! Forgive me... Forgive me! Please, don't be upset. It's just that I'm nervous these days. I was so afraid. For the matter of the child, you know? I don't know why, love, but I was afraid. Afraid to tell you. Afraid of me? I wanted anyone knowing. Massimo, you don't know my folks. They're good people! Big deal! With my troubles, I lacked the news of a child. - That's why, see? Say... You're not upset, are you? You love me? - Yes, yes. I'll go with you tonight. - No, I'll be nervous, and you'll make a scene for... No, I swear! But if that girl... - She doesn't count. Come on, Elena, don't start over, please. As you wish. So then... I'll go to the movies with Sandro. You mind? - Who, me? Surely if I were to have a jealousy fit as you do any time you go with Sandro! But, if you don't want... - No, no. Hello? Is it you? Bravo Filippo. You're sure, huh? See you there. Yes. Bye. The time is 1:28:07. Totalizator: Winner: 12. Placed: 60, 45... - I'll gamble these. - Want a coffee? - Each-Way:.. Two coffee. If Clarice doesn't break at the start, may even win. - And its odds? Listen... What are the odds for Clarice? - 4 to 1. Why don't you bet? Yes, I will. Where do I find you? - At the restaurant. - All right. It makes no sense. Why? It's a value. - Two coffee. Maybe you're rich enough not to mind these things. But I do. I am a small-bourgeois, prudent and calculating. A gift like that must have a why. One which I don't like. Don't worry, there isn't a why. It made me cheer. I saw it at Bulgari's and it looked just fit for you. Look how wonderful. If you wish, I can say it's a gift in the name of our old friendship. Or a wedding gift in advance. But I don't care about the old friendship. And as for your wedding... - Massimo... Yes? Massimo, I... So then? Bet on Peter. - But... - Go. Hey! Hey! Forgive me for everything. Even for the brooch, but keep it. It is the memory of an amazing evening. At least for me. Clarice winning, 2,000 lire. - It's an oddball horse, you'll lose. Dick's for sure. - Forget it! Okay at 3.5? Can we give it to him at 3.5? - Sure! Peter 175 to 50! The ticket! - I'll give it, don't worry. - Excuse me, please. Tomorrow at 15:30, at the hippodrome of Vallelunga, flat racing and Championship of 'Butteri' from Latium. All services available. The favorite is Dick, no. 6, but I've bet on Peter, no. 1. But then, why you made me bet on Clarice? - For good luck. Why do you deal with racing? It seems like a game, not a real job. A game that won't let you sleep. For Fontana. This on Peter. - I'll be damned! Third race. Trevi Prix. The 8 competitors are called to the tapes. In order, will start: Peter, Barone, Arco, Clarice, Dick, Amelia, Coccio, Zolla. What's wrong? - Nothing. It's not true. Starts to be humid, at night. - You're right, watch my breath. Remember when as kids we smoked paper? - What are they doing? They don't start? All done. - 500,000? - Yes. - Ready! - Zolla, no. 11, led by Saraceni. Side by side, the sulkies pass the starter, while the tapes are about to snap. - Ready, set, go! They're off! Peter soon takes the lead, followed by Barone, Arco and Clarice. And then Dick, then the others further back. At the first bend, Peter, Arco and Barone. Dick reaches Clarice, tries to flank it, but lags behind. Outdistanced, Amalia, Coccio, Zolla. At the first straightaway, in order, Peter, Barone, Arco, then Clarice, Dick. Dick flanks Clarice and passes. We're not far from the stables bend. The sulky No. 3, Arco, led by Bero, is alarmed because Dick, No. 6, is gaining ground on him. Hey! Here it is. Go on. Go on. Bero widens and cuts off Dick, that had come alongside Rossi, leading Barone. Clarice has accelerated... Beautiful that brooch. I hadn't noticed. What a race! If it goes well, tonight we party. ...overtaking the bend and passing quickly in front of the grandstands. Peter is still ahead by two lengths on Barone and Arco at the rope. But now Dick attacks wide, trying to approach Bero, who whips and fights back for a few meters, but he can't hold on, and breaks stride, rearing up. The crowd echoes the action of Dick, that takes the place of No. 3, disqualified, almost alongside Barone, No. 2. But here is that Rossi, No. 2, compels Dick, No. 6, to go wide, breaking up the action, but breaking stride in turn. So, Barone's violence against Dick is rightly balanced by the breaking of the same Barone, that acted unfairly. In fact the crowd noisily remarks this unexpected development. It was a sure thing! - I had told you. ...Peter will cross the finish alone, unless Clarice, No. 5, that now is slowly gaining ground, manages to get past him. In fact, Peter feels the danger, and runs the final straight rather nervously. Christ! Go on! That's it! What we expected may be about to happen. Clarice manages to pull alongside him. The two fight to the breaking point, but Clarice resists. Go on! - With a great sprint it reaches Peter up to cross the finish together! Only the photograph will decide in a few seconds this exciting Prix, which was not without surprises. - What's up? - Nothing. It's all a bluff. I won an each way bet! It's Clarice, don't you see? - No, I tell you. Yes! - See? There's the photograph. We are different. We say what we think, we lay our cards on the table! I don't feel so perfect. Massimo is like us. And can be much better than us. What do you know? What did he tell you, to make you believe..? - Nothing! He only spoke well of you. - And I speak ill of him, tell him! I want at least the right to speak ill of him, the right to tell him... - Stop it! All right. Anyway, sooner or later you'll wise up. It's not over yet, Lucia. Clarice! Clarice won! Clarice won! This race was fishy! You took a big responsibility. You agreed too. Now we're in a mess. You said the other horses didn't count. Now get out the money that I gave you. You know what you've done? You've messed up one million and a half. Well, what can I do? Start! So, with the 100 you had me bet, you owe me 1.1. Shall we go in the hall, so you give me the money? It's 1,100,000, by God! I'm not kidding. I can ruin you, you know? So? Tonight is not the time. We'll talk about it later. Let me go. I have commitments. I want it now! - I don't think so. Like I said, we'll talk later. You didn't sign the paper deliberately. You wanted to fool me from the start! I'll fix you up! It's true what Daniele said. It's all true. Now I'm sure. But I don't care. I love you, Massimo. How many girls come here? How many have the keys to your apartment? - None. Yes, that's it. And then there are those who didn't return the keys. We begin by changing the lock. But, can we talk seriously for a moment? - No. I'll have to talk to Daniele. This is part of my things to fix. Love, I don't see why. Poor Daniele. As you see, you're not the only one making troubles. I too got my share. How can you say that, Lucia? You are... - Hush. From tomorrow, each on their own. And then... And then? Love, for 2 or 3 days I don't want to be found here. You can come to my place. "Closed" Excuse me. Did you see Massimo? Has he come? - Mr. Fontana won't come today. I don't know if you heard. There was a little incident the other night at the races. So, in short... there is an ongoing investigation. It will be a long job! But you talked to him this morning? - Of course. I don't understand. I hope nothing happened to him. I phoned him, I went to look for him. But, I found everything closed. Sure, it's a delicate matter. Mr. Fontana may prefer... He's certainly busy, you know. - But, Sandro Torrenova has come? I don't know... I don't know, miss. If you'll excuse me. May I use the phone? - Please, go ahead. Hello? Is there Sandro, please? But how do I know, my dear lady? I wouldn't have dared to disturb you if it weren't urgent. Important to me. I think I heard him say on the phone that was supposed to be at the Casina Valadier. But, when and with whom, my dear lady, I wouldn't know. I'm sorry. You're welcome. I don't care. Not a bit. - But how? When a jury makes a decision... Let them take all steps they want. I'm tired of the hall. Enough. If you want to buy the license, it's a good deal. Half a million. Sell what? The license is taken away with authority. The Agency doesn't joke. You're out of money? Remember my IOUs. - But yes, yes. Just sold the license, I'll redeem them all together. - The license again! I was joking. - Look, but tell me, what happened to you? - To me? Nothing! I'm fine. - I see. But what's up? You didn't show up for 2 days. Listen, Sandro. I may need a favor from you. Massimo! - Hello, beauty! - Elena, how are you? What happened at the racing hall? - Nothing. But I'm aware, they questioned a jockey beaten by Mario and Filippo. They said you're all in cahoots. - It's not true. And then, since when you care of affairs that don't concern you? I thought... maybe that's why you had disappeared. Well... yes... actually, there is an investigation. Sit. Not even time to call me! But you know in what state I am? You know that..? Say! You ever thought I am a minor? I can even resort to the Police, denounce you! Tell me the truth... There is someone, right? You don't love me anymore? I do love you. But I have many hassles, little darling. You should understand, right? Besides, I've always said that I wasn't going to marry you. But what should we do with a child at a time like this? What do you mean? What did you understand? I don't know. You're so changed. You leave me all alone. You're weird. You're wrong. Only, I don't want tragedies. Be a good girl! Smile. Want to go out? Shall we go somewhere? Arrange what you wish. Want to see people? We bring them home. Come on, be good. Smile! Go on! Think about how we are stubborn in hopes. When you phoned me this morning to come here, and you wanted to talk... I got intrigued. She will tell me... She will tell me... I love you, understand? I'd like to wish you to be happy, but for me there is but the happiness we can have together! And Massimo doesn't deserve this happiness! You don't know, you can't understand. - I know everything, I told you. Possibly much more than you. I know I can trust. I will propose him to come with me. I have a job offer in England. What I earn, will be enough for both of us in early times. And then, he will make his own path. - You deceive yourself, he'll never accept! His strength is in this small circle of snobs and shady business he can dominate! Do not wish ill to Massimo. He has no blame in our story. It happened to him what happened to me. When will you see him? - I hope to never see him again. Why? We'll all be good friends again. We'll pay, down to the last penny. It is I who am committed. We're keeping accounts! You'll get married? I did not ask him. I will not ask him. The only condition I lay is that he comes away, starts all anew, pays all. The rest comes by itself. I'll let you know if I won or I lost the first bout. Yes? Alright. As agreed. Bye, Lucia. Bye, see you. Broadcast at 9:00. Alright. Come on! What truth or dare is it? You're only telling us lies! - You're so boring! The truth, the whole truth! - It's my turn. I know one thing... I'm the truth in person! - No dirty questions! Here we go! - Thank goodness - Perfect! But Sandro, stop it! You are a pain! Elena, you know you're really elegant? Why, it's ugly? - No, it's beautiful, I swear. There's no fun, this is not truth or dare! - Oh, I swear it's the truth. No, enough! Next one. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, Catch a tiger by the toe. If he hollers, let him go, Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. Guys! There's Pierr! Hello everybody! Guys, I brought a gift to the monastery. Question: Would you like a watermelon cocktail? Yes! - To me the melon! There! Hooray! - Bravo. And now, bring me some whiskey, some Cognac, Benedictine, Cointreau and 3 drops of angostura. And.. You know, Pierr? We're playing truth or dare. - Oh, yeah? And who's under? - Me. I ask the questions! Silence! Bottles, knife and ice. Excuse me! Excuse me! Silence! You tell the truth, you? - Of course! What did you do that night in Ostia when you remained alone with the inmate? You said, sorry? They asked you what you did that night on the beach with Daniele. I looked at the moon and saw a falling star. Well, what's so funny? - May I ask her one more question, I? Shut up, be quiet! Standing,.. or lying? Lying! Now the third question! And the angostura? You didn't bring the angostura! You did not bring angostura! The marathoner! Hello! I'm sorry, I didn't know you had people. Since I can not tonight, I must go to the radio, I wanted to warn you. The phone was always busy. - Get off! - It's them! Come play. - I'll be right. - Excuse me, guys. - If you want to go... Don't go away, sorry. I had to invite these people after that mess. I didn't want to give the impression of being guilty, to hide. What do you care about these people's opinion? And then, hadn't we said... - Lucia, are you offended? Are you upset? No, nonsense. Look,.. I have to go now. I want to make you a proposal. I took a job in England, a good post. I'm leaving in a week. I'm leaving the radio, come with me. Massimo, we are going to dance. It is not a proposal for a pleasure trip. I mean, come with me. Leave everything, we liquidate everything Entrust to a lawyer the chores to be settled. I spoke with Daniele. It was not an easy thing. I see that your girlfriend, rather... - Cause she's here? Love, I could not do otherwise. But you think that..? Okay, dear. Tonight I'm at the radio until late, then I'll go home. Think about what I said. You'll answer yes or no. Love, my love... Go, your guests are waiting. - Give me a kiss! Goodnight. What does she want? Now you bring her even here at home! She came looking for Daniele. Beware, Massimo! Don't challenge me. In the state I'm in, I might do anything. You're cute when you're mad. Sandro! How do I close here? I'm under the water, Sandro! You play. You like irritating me. Don't you realize my state? But no! No, Elena. You know how much I'd like to. But not now. Not now that I feel so down. That I have so much trouble. But why? It's the same. Eh, you'll see yourself in a month or two! If you could be free... No! No, Massimo! I won't! I can't! So what should I do, my love? It's you not to realize. My situation is disastrous. You know, we don't have a penny! I don't want, don't want... All right! I don't know what else to tell you. I'll do what you want, love. You're a smart girl, Elena! Master, watermelon in the room is almost ready! But yes, now! Alright. Cheerful, little star! Just, don't be concerned,.. if I'll be a bit... fugitive these days. Hello! How are you? My bones are broken. Nice friend you are! I didn't sleep. Rehearsals all night... - Rehearsals? "The blond Tiber". And where are we? Aren't you at the "Circe"? So why get off here? So now you take the bus again and go right back to Rome? - What? But you're crazy! I'm going to sleep. Then, once I'm here, take a dip. You can do it at home in the tub! Want a drink? They got no whiskey, I warn you. Get some milk to detox. You'll explain all these mysteries. I've yet to understand why you left Rome. They say you ran away. That it's not true that you sold the hall, but it was the Agency. Phoned me a lawyer. To learn about my IOUs! You know they seized your car? See now the reason why I called you here? I must talk to you exactly about this. Then, there is another small matter... I'm going to leave Rome for some time. I have in mind a good deal, out there. And I would take with me Elena. But, I want her alone, understand? Without hassles. It's something delicate. And you're the only one who can help me. You know about life. And it also takes money that I have not. If you... - Me? And what do you want me to do, I? I never had children. Will you help me or not? You saw Mr. Fontana? - Yes, he left early. He left you a note. Want breakfast? No, thanks, after the bathe. - All right. Here it is, miss. You're awake, honey? Seen that good weather? Be right back, I'm looking for a sailboat and we go out. Your Massimo. Sandro, for once that I ask you a favor. - Ha! And then, is not even for me, after all. It's for Elena. To think that you like her so much. - Yes, she's so likable. But it's you who... Well, never mind. I can not leave her in trouble. - Again! But I have breakfast now, and we'll talk tomorrow. Not a chance. You go, and hurry. - Why? What's the rush? A lot. I want Elena to be able to leave in 3 or 4 days at the most, get it? You won't go without settling my IOUs? Don't give me trouble with my father! Sandro, I have one friend only. I won't risk him for peanuts. Think of Elena. Go! - Wait! Phone right away what you've done. - But when are you coming? When you tell me it's all done. Bye! - MINISTRY OF FINANCE- Come. They have no objection to show you. Of course, I explained the matter, and that we appealed. - So then? But of course! He denounced you and took the prize. Which at that time... You were arrested at the very moment that the rascal had to give you the exact account of everything. To avoid it, he got rid of you. Lawyer Passamonti knew it, he defended you in agreement with Massimo Fontana. Were it for me, in jail would be him. Come, come! - No, what's the point? You told me all. Enough, let's go. But no! Now that you're here, come. And then, it's better. Sir, you allow me introduce you my client? - Please, please, come in. Well! It seems ridiculous that I should come to teach you that you can avoid getting to such consequences. I assure you, mom, I've always tried... - It is not true! But, it's her. Do not worry. I know that kind of girls. She's done everything to get you a fait accompli. And you know what? Don't give a hoot! That's all we need! If your father had to marry all the girls who put him in a position to be married! No, Mom. Elena is not just any girl who tries to get married. I won't say she doesn't wish it. See? - It's a good family, small clerks. Imagine! - Quite poor, considering. - Obviously! - But Elena is an angel. I assure you she's not blackmailing. No. Just... Just that... I mean, I won't leave her as is! If it can't be done otherwise, I'll marry her. You won't be mad? - I may be, but I will. Moreover, I'm of age, no? Is that so, huh? And you don't think of us, do you? For you it's a done and decided deal. Hello. - Hello. Elena? - She's inside with Daniele. We met him here. - I don't want to see him. - Who says you should? I wanted to tell you something. I... I've fixed everything. Elena must go to this address today. Nothing to tell and nothing to pay. It's all on my parents. Hey, you know what I said? I told them that it's... my son, in short. No! You're an ace. - I warned you so you make no gaffes. Well, I won't take her there, not the case, right? - Not true. Elena doesn't know anything. I mean, that the child is mine. All right. See you later. - At your home? I'll call you. Not at home, maybe I won't be there, I don't know. Go to Daniele. Oh! And don't tell Daniele... - Oh, no. - Go! ...is of fur. You men make me laugh! Hello, Elena. - Hello. - Cheerful, huh? There is Massimo. See you soon. And I'll be best man at the wedding. Look, Sandro. Now we go to Massimo's house and wait for him there. I must talk to him. And I'd be glad there was a witness. Although little estimable as you are. - Oh, thank you. Look, it's better for you to find another. And then, Massimo won't go home. He will, sooner or later. And we await him. What do you want from him? What from me? - Nothing. Shall we drink something in the meantime? - Thanks. 2 whiskey on my account. - Now. Count... - Yes? - If you could... The bill is skyrocketing. - How much is it? - So much I've been drinking? - Yes, Count. Well, add also these two, ok? - Yes, Count. These days seemed eternal. And then, love, I'm afraid you hide me something. That your situation is more difficult than you tell me. Don't worry, it'll be okay. - When we leave? - Soon as you can, dear. And we do a test honeymoon all alone. Say, in 2 days, can I come away? Better not be in a hurry. Stay one day more, even two. No, love. You'll come see me? - But is impossible there! So then? Massimo, I'm so scared! It's a trifle, believe me. What did you say at home? - That I'd go to Luisa's villa. That you'd come, too. And that I'm in love with you. Why? What's got into you? - I shouldn't have said it? I've only said this. You know my parents. Soon they'll get a blow, knowing that I go away with you. And we'll also have many children, right? Well? What're you doing here? You see it. We're doing an ambush. Hi. Hi. I'm busy. I told you not to come, I must get away. - I told him, but he... Try to contradict him. He wants me to be a witness. - Why? You need witnesses? I wanted a witness. So, might as well be him. Who is destined to go the way I did with you. You're so sly that you hadn't thought that I could come to know. - What're you doing? That they would give me the written statement! The account of what you've earned on my skin! What are you talking about? I don't understand. Lucia! I don't want to hear you mention Lucia! Don't be afraid. Don't tremble, you coward! Don't tremble, I won't hurt you! For now, I just want to tell you that you make me sick! He made me do 3 years in prison for pocketing 200,000 lire! Shut up! Shut up! Want evidence? I have it, I told you. Everything! Don't be afraid, I won't harm you! Not for you, you know? For her! I want to leave you healthy, safe, free! I don't want her to think that I've truncated your radiant redemption! She might even believe so. But I want her to find out for herself, day by day, that you're a creep! Damn! She has to realize! You may have reasons to think so. But it won't be so. When are you going? I want you to leave immediately. Go away! Why should he care that you go with Elena? Shut up, you! What did he tell you? No! That poor girl is risking her life! Because of you! Is involved my mother! What're you saying? - You deny it? - Shut up! - No! Let him say! Even myself I got entangled. Saying that I'm the father! That it was I! Let him speak! Let him say! What are you doing? Are you mad? I wouldn't have told you anything. But it's better this way, now. I had told you... that I was guilty toward Daniele. As for him... Sandro and Elena are expecting a baby. And since Sandro can not marry her... You hear that? You hear that? Speak up you, for he's capable to make her believe anything! Look! Look here. Here it is! Here is the proof that he denounced me! Go on, tell her! I love you, Lucia. We'll be free, we'll leave together. Speak up, by God! Why lend yourself to these crappy games? Speak! He forced me to tell my mother... Sandro! Sandro! We killed him. We have killed him! What do you say? Help me! He's fainted! Only fainted. Get some ice! Call for a doctor. Hurry, some ice! In the fridge. Help me. Let's pull him up. What is it, there's no line? It's useless. He's dead. What shall we say? Before people come... Sandro is dead. What shall we say? No, he's not dead. It's not possible. But why it's always busy? It is an accident. Might as well make it appear as an accident. Hello? Hello? Doctor... Doctor Laurelli? Is not there? Where is he, Miss? At the clinic? Give me the number. It's urgent. Yes. You think he suffered? - He died instantly, didn't he? I think so. It would take an autopsy to be able to... - Horrible. What's the use? By now... But when was that? - In the afternoon, at Massimo's house. Don't know. I was just telling Giuliana. You remember that time we were at Massimo's home, last week? Sandro was sitting on the sill. And he drank! I remember it exactly. He drank too much. - Right. It seems he had drunk even today. You lose more easily the balance when you drink. Poor Countess. She did not want to believe it. Her only child. Any statement for the press? - Even the press! We were joking. I found him waiting for me by about an hour. There was also the lady. - Oh, what a shock! Poor thing, how pale! Don't you take her away? - What's the lady's name? Lucia Riva. - What time was it? I didn't notice the time, maybe it was half past six, little more. I wouldn't know. - Yes, it happens. One never knows the time. Who looks at the watch? Then something happens, and everyone: "What, you don't know at what time?" He screamed? How did it happen? He was expected at the revue's rehearsal. I phoned to scold him. He had to be there at 8, and instead, poor thing, by then was already... The Countess. Look at her, poor thing. But Elena was not with you? - No, she wasn't there. No, it is not possible! We can not lie like that. We have killed him! It was not an accident. We have killed him! And you! You, how can you pretend like that? How can you be quiet? There is Elena. It's not Sandro's child. Sandro died for this story! It's the shock! - Got statements for the press? - Leave me alone! Let me talk! It's my fault too. Lady, you know what I say. I heard it myself from Sandro. Be good. We must run to Elena. Now! Daniele. You tell them, if they won't talk. They want that everything seems clean. They want to keep hidden the blots! It doesn't matter if is at stake the life of a baby. Here too! Here too, you have to lie! It's us the guilty, the three of us. You did what you had to. Miss Elena Mauri has already returned to her home. Luckily, we arrived on time. For now, you can go. We'll call you back if necessary. Wait. I'll have you accompany. I'll send for a car. - No need, thank you. Just... I wish I could have a word with Mr. Massa. I repeat once again, Commissioner... Daniele Massa is more victim than culpable. Wait. Daniele... I told the Commissioner everything I knew. That you have no fault. Now, just think of yourself. It's not right that you should again... - But you, what will you do? Farewell, Daniele. Poor Lucia. Everything alright. Everything respectable. I was able only... to damage you. I even came up to... justify him, you see? Up to justify him out of love. I... I wish I could find some peace within myself. For having done what I had to do. What was right to do. Instead... I suffer so much. Because I think that now he hates me. He hates me... Mr. Massa. For now, you can go. Remain, however, at our disposal. Lucia... The Commissioner... is really a good person. And he said: "A decent girl... should not walk alone at night. " "Don't leave her. Take her home. " Lucia... I've always loved you. Ever since you were a child. I waited for you all my life. You know it. Even when I was in jail. Let me say. Now, you're alone. I want to tell you... that I will continue to wait. And maybe... one day... When you will be healed... If you want it... END
