You didn't let me finish. ''Too bad she's really a guy.'' (gasps) You have got to be kidding. l can't believe you didn't tell me. You've slept over at my house. (gasps) You've borrowed my bras! Hey, l look good in a mustache. Oh, yeah, l would definitely date me. Me too. (both) Awkward. Uh-oh. Let me gus. lt's another article about Jake Ryan, isn't it? lt says that his movie is done and he's back in town for the premiere. (scoffs) Big whoop. l don't need some guy who kiss me knowing he's about to leave for six months to do some stupid movie. Jake could fall out of the sky wearing a tuxedo and l wouldn't care. Uh, Miley? l'm serious. He could come down, giving me a dozen ros, and it would make no difference. Zero, zilch, el zippo. What if he got down on his kne and begged you to take him back? Like that's ever gonna happen. Sorry it's only one rose, but l did bring chocolat. Not just chocolat, chocolat from the sky. Jake, l don't know what to say, so l gus l'll just show you how l feel. (crowd) Ohh! Thank you. # Come on! # You get the limo out front # Hottt styl, every shoe every color # Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun # lt's really you but no one ever discovers # Who would have thought that a girl like me # Would double as a superstar # You get the bt of both worlds # Chill it out, take it slow # Then you rock out the show # You get the bt of both worlds # Mix it all together # And you know that it's the bt of both worlds # (chuckling) Thanks. Gee, another basket from Jake. What a surprise. l agree, Mile. Either date this boy Jake or tell him to send a workout tape, 'cause l'm about one muffin away from my easy-fit jeans. l got two words for ya: Willpower. l got two words for you: Mini jelli. Mmm. l am so weak. Look who was waiting in the driveway. You can almost hear him say, (deep voice) ''Miley, take me back. Gimme one more chance.'' - Oh, l'll give you something. - (gasps) Not the chocolate chip on. Use the bran. Nobody eats those. Oh, my dad do. He calls them ''nature's broom.'' Ooh, peanut butter balls. Hello? Guys, this jerk hurt me and he's not gonna win me back with peanut butter balls. OK, you're right, darling. l'm getting rid of everything. Ooh, and l'll start by grilling up the perfectly marbled T-bon. - Medium rare, please. - Got it. Come on, Miley, the poor guy's done just about everything a girl can want. - What more could he do? - (rattling) Yeah, Miley. What else can l do? You're never gonna stop, are you? Miley, you've dumped stuff on me and you've yelled at me. The one thing you haven't done is tell me you don't care about me. Tell me that, and l'll go away. No! You can't! He's so in your... l mean, come on! l know l kissed you and then left, and l'm sorry. But l never stopped thinking about you. (gasps) He never stopped! And now... l mean, come on! - l'll just go help with the steaks. - You do that. Come on, Jakers. OK. l never stopped thinking about you either. - Then you'll give me another chance? - How about we start with tonight. Ooh. Uh... (metal rattling) Slight problem. Tonight's my movie premiere. Oh, that's OK. l mean, it's a little more public than l wanted... No, no, no. Uh, see, the thing is... You already have a date, don't you? Oh, it's not a real date, OK? (stammers) lt's with my co-star, OK? We just have to pretend we're dating for the prs. A kiss or two, but it don't mean anything. Nothing you say ever means anything. You're the same jerk you were six months ago, except now, you're a jerk with a headache. l don't have a... - Oh, no. - Oh, y. (sighs) l'm so hot. Y, you are. Could l get a bottled water? Y, you are. Can. l mean, y, you can. Oh, sorry. Rico just tripled his price to three bucks. But that's all l have, and as l said before l'm so, so hot. Don't go anywhere. Whoo! OK. l've taken care of me. Now you. You can have the employee discount. (zipping) (wild laugh) - You're fired! - What are you talking about? Nice work, Natasha. Go buy yourself something pretty. No, no, wait! Come back! l'm willing to look past this and start anew. - You ripped me off! - Me? You're the one ripping people off. Three bucks for a bottle of water? That's stealing. That's America. You want to give stuff away? Open your own shack. You can call it lHOF. lnternational House of Failure. Oh, well, maybe l will. But instead l'll call it lnternational House of... ...Reasonably-Priced Water and Fri and Stuff. lHORPWAFUS. Yeah, yeah! Hear the name and tremble, Rico. lHORPWAFUS. l'm Brian Winters and the stars are all out for the premiere of Teen Gladiators and the Sword of Fire. And here are the Teen Gladiators, Jake Ryan and Marissa Hugh, coming over to talk to me, Brian Winters. So, Jake, l don't know what's bigger, the buzz about this movie or the buzz about you two. Oh, well, thanks, Brian. We're both really excited about this movie. - Aren't we, honey? - We sure are, Jakey. (mocking) ''We sure are, Jakey.'' Look at her, draped over him like... drap. Cheap, clingy drap. lt's disgusting. Sure is. How can you guys keep eating that stuff? That's Jake's steak. lt's the stake he drove through my heart. The good news is, it cuts like butter. Dad! l'm sorry, darling, but you're better off without him. lf he's gonna choose her over you, he obviously has no taste. Except in meat. This fillet is fantastic. Look at him, all kissy with Marissy. ''lt's only pretend. lt don't mean anything.'' Yeah, right! l was on your TV show, bub. You're not that good an actor! So, Jake, tell me, when did you first know you were in love? Well, l know it sounds hokey, but the minute l looked into Miley's ey... - Miley? - (gasps) Oh, sorry. l... l meant Marissa. What? - Did he just say...? - Shh. Yow. Girls hate the name flub. Trust me, been there, done that. But, uh, we all make mistak, right, Jake? Yeah. And l'm in the middle of a big one right now. Marissa's a good friend. The truth is... ...l'm in love with a girl named Miley Stewart. Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo! But l blew it. That's the difference between movi and real life. ln real life you don't always get a happy ending. (tape rewinding) l'm in love with a girl named Miley Stewart. - Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo! - (tape rewinding) l'm in love with a girl named Miley Stewart. - (tape rewinding) - (Jake) l'm in love with... Mile! You're gonna break it. l don't care. Hey, gladiator. Miley? Who says real life don't have happy endings? This is so cool! l'm used to Hannah being famous, but now Miley is too. Your life is totally gonna change. - (doorbell rings) - lt is not, other than having the bt boyfriend ever! My Miley life is gonna stay exactly the same. Hi, hi! Ashley, are you lost? You are so funny! l've always loved that about you. Mean girl say what? (laughing) Stop it! You are a delight. We are gonna be such great friends. Lilly, l love what you've done with your hair. l'm wearing a hat. Hi, hi! What are you doing here? - You said you were going to the mall. - You said you were getting a manicure. - l am, with my new BFF. - You mean my new BFF. Ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow ow ow ow! Uh, all your beach needs at reasonable pric. l... l got Mylar balloons and... and day-old bran muffins. Oh, come on, everybody, they're nature's broom! Hey, Jackson, how's it going? l don't get it. Rico rips people off and he still gets all the busins. Well, maybe because at Rico's you get overpriced hot dogs, right? And here you get half-priced food poisoning. l mean, seriously, Jackson, this relish... (sniffs) stinks. - That's mayonnaise. - OK. Hmm. OK, so... So maybe the shack don't have ''refrigeration'' and the food isn't always ''edible,'' and maybe we do have a little bit of a ''bug problem.'' But the shack's got character, - and like me, it's here to stay. - (creaking) l can fix this. You got nacho chee all over my mom's homemade jerky. How will l live with the guilt? l was supposed to take this to the precinct for the other cops, but now you got the meat with the chee. lt's not kosher... Oh, Detective Schwartz is gonna go all mhugana. Dude, l don't want to tell you how to run your shack, but this only works for, like, really short people. - Not now, Todd. - Hey, what's this? Well, it was my mom's homemade jerky. (Todd) Covered in chee? How is it? (chuckl) (beatbox mouthing) - # l'm the man who had the chee - # l'm the man who had the jerky - # We put 'em both together... - # And dude, it really worky (both) # Chee Jerky # Say what? Say what? Chee Jerky - # Say what? - # Say what? # Mozzarella-moose, swiss-salmon gouda-turkey # Just one taste lt'll drive you berserky (both) # Chee Jerky! Say what? Say what? # And that's all (mimics scratching) Frh Sizzlin' Stewart, Smokin' Oken Enterpris. Patent pending. Chee jerky? That's the dumbt thing l ever heard. Maybe, but it's delicious. - (groans) - Just try it. - (spits) Blecch! - You don't like it? lt's delicious and it's not mine. Yet. You see those sparkly stars in a line? That's Orion's belt. And that star just to the right of the belt? That's my new favorite. lt's named Miley. Shut up. lt is not. lt is now. Here's the certificate to prove it. You named a star after me? lt was either that or a half-mile of lnterstate 5. Miley, l've never felt so close to anyone before, and l don't want there to be any secrets between us, so l'm gonna tell you something l've never told anyone before. Please don't have a hairy back. Please don't have a hairy back. My real name is Llie. Llie, right. That's good. Seriously, what's the secret? That is the secret. And l love that name! l had a hamster named Llie once until l figured out it was a boy. - Go ahead, make fun. - No, no, no, l'm sorry. l'm actually touched that you trust me so much. l do. And l can't tell you how great it feels that l don't have to hide part of my life from you 'cause l know that you'd never do that to me. Yeah. Sure. Of course. Now we know everything about each other. Yeah. Sure. Of course. There are no secrets between us. Yeah. Sure. Of course. That star didn't set you back too much, did it? Well... So.. Yep. (rustling) Dad. Don't you think the light would be much better in the house? Oh, don't worry about me, darlin'. l can see everything l need to see right here. Oh, all right. l'm gonna read Family Circus now, so it should take about two seconds. Ready? One, two! Good night, Jake! Uh... good night, sir. (groans) Oh, honey, don't be mad at me. l gave you two seconds. lt's not my fault the boy's got slow lips. lt's not that. Daddy, tonight Jake was totally hont with me, and because of the Hannah secret l couldn't be the same with him. And when he asked me out for tomorrow night, l had to lie to him again because Hannah's reading to that second grade class tomorrow. What kind of relationship will it be if l have to lie to him about half of my life? Well, you could always tell him the truth. - What?! - Or not. Honey, l know it's a tough decision, but l'm sure you'll make the right one. No, l won't. l'm 1 4. l'm almost guaranteed to ms this up. You're the adult. You're supposed to tell me what to do. What kind of a father would l be if l just ordered you around all the time? A normal one? l swear, you are no help at all. Huh. Boy, even when l don't say something, l say something wrong. Well, at least they're off the porch. ''And so all the animals on... ...Hont lsland were saved. All because Trudy, the Truthful Turtle... ...promised she would never tell... ...another lie.'' Thank you, Hannah. Class? (all) Thank you, Hannah Montana! Do anyone have qutions about honty for Miss Montana? Or we could read another book? How about, uh... Frankie the Fibbing Frog. Sweet niblets. Samantha? Hannah, have you ever lied? Good qution. Any more qutions? Y, sweetie? Why won't you answer Samantha's qution? Listen, sometim life gets complicated, and people get put into situations that are complicated... Miss Montana, l'm sure you're not suggting to a class of second graders - that lying is ever OK? - No, no, no, no. Of course not. lt's just that, uh, sometim... you have to. Hannah Montana's a liar! (all) Ooh! No, no! Of course not. Listen, listen. (stammers) You know... Well... Superman don't tell Lois Lane that he's Clark Kent, but it don't mean he don't love her. - Superman's a liar? - (all) Whoa! - No, no, never mind. He isn't real. - Superman isn't real? Oh, OK, come on. OK. How many of your parents have told you that you're gonna be prident someday? Well, see? Think about it. Not all of you can be prident. Odds are none of you will be prident. (children crying) What... lt's just that... (stammering) Who wants free CDs? - (all bawling) - Free CDs, everyone! Hey, Miley. Got your call. What's up? Jake... ...you were totally hont with me, and l have a secret too. And l'm not sure how you're gonna take it. Oh, come on, how bad can it be? You're not married, are you? No, l'm not married and... ...neither is Hannah Montana. What? l'm Hannah Montana. (# Miley Cyrus: One ln A Million) l'm Hannah Montana. Jake? Jake? Llie? Uh, just give me a second, OK? lf it helps, you're doing better than Oliver. He fainted when l told him. Jake Ryan don't faint. Llie, on the other hand, is a little woozy. (sighs) Listen... ...if you're gonna be mad, don't be mad at Miley. - She wanted to tell you, but... - But what? Hannah wouldn't let her? Well, you know, she's a pop star. You know how they can be. Total divas. l try to avoid 'em. So it's just the two of you, right? You're not also the Dixie Chicks, are you? No, just Miley and Hannah. Two chicks here. Well, if that's the case, then l think you're both pretty great. - Really? - Really. (helicopter whirring) Oh, man, paparazzi. (both) They follow me everywhere. l think they're following me. You know, uh, big movie about to open. Hello, millions of albums already sold. OK, we'll just go ask 'em, then. - No! - Whoa. You're not dating Hannah, you're dating Miley. You can't get caught cheating on me with me. - Huh? - Keep up, movie star. Ain't rocket science. # Come on! # You get the limo out front # Hottt styl, every shoe every color # Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun # lt's really you but no one ever discovers # Who would have thought that a girl like me # Would double as a superstar # You get the bt of both worlds # Chill it out, take it slow # Then you rock out the show # You get the bt of both worlds # Mix it all together # And you know that it's the bt of both worlds # (chuckling) (mouth full) Helicopters? Movie stars? Forbidden love? lt's all so romantic. lt would be even more romantic if you would chew with your mouth closed. So when you told him you were Hannah, he didn't faint? - Not once? - Nope. Steady as a rock. All man. Well, uh, so am l. l just hadn't eaten that day. You know what the bt part is? l can finally be myself with a guy. No more secrets, just a normal boy-girl relationship. (music playing on screen) Why don't you all take a picture? lt'll last longer. Hello, people! lt's just an exprsion. Miley, relax. Just ignore them. - Why don't l get us some drinks? - OK. Wow, l'm kind of thirsty. You want, uh, water, fruit juice or iced tea? Are you sure you're not mad l made us leave early? That's OK. Giv us more time to... (Robby) Who wants lemonade? ...say hi to your dad. Y, sir. Sweet lemonade. Refrhing and as close to puckering as anybody's gonna get around here. Excuse me, Jake. - Daddy, could l talk to you in private? - Sure, darlin'. Listen, Dad, um, l don't know how to tell you this... Go away! OK. l can take a hint. l'm gonna step out and let you kids have a little chat. But just remember... ...the heating ducts have ears. (sighs) l swear. We'll never be alone. We are now. No, we're not. Right, Dad? (Robby) Right, bud! Don't worry, Miley. Your dad's just being a rponsible parent, and l admire him for that. (Robby) Won't work, boy, but nice try. lt's not my nosy, annoying dad l'm worried about. lt's your fans. They wouldn't leave us alone all night. Come on. Fans are just a part of the territory. Thought Hannah Montana would be used to that. She is, but Miley isn't. That's the reason l made up the secret, so l could go out in the world like a normal person. And that's kinda hard to do when you're dating me. A little bit. Do this help? A little bit. How about a little bit more? (Robby) l'm not hearing any chattin'. - (loud whistle) - (Robby screams) Sonny, this Chee Jerky is fantastic. You have to give me the recipe. Oh, sorry, ma'am. My mom's jerky and his dad's chee recipe, they're top secret. But l am a grandmother. You can trust me. You know, we would, but we weren't born yterday. And neither was this baby. Coochie-coochie-coo! Rico! (muffled) This isn't... This isn't over! That Cheeze Jerky will be mine! (cackling) Vmonos, abuelita. Aw, man, it's packed. This is gonna be a disaster. No, it's not. lf Oliver orders the chili dog pizza again, we'll just sit by the window. Actually l'm, uh, not hungry. l'm all Cheeze Jerkied up. Which brings us right back to the window. Stop worrying about Oliver. l'm thinking about Jake. No matter where we go, it's like a zoo: The beach, the movi, the mall. Everybody just do this... OK, that's creepy. Oh, and by the way, easy on the liner. Lookin' a little trampy. (imitating Borat) She look very nice to me. Thanks. Appreciate it, but l have a boyfriend. Big coincidencey, 'cause l have American girlfriend, and her name is Miley. Weirdo say what? (whispers) Miley, it's me. - (all) Jake? - Shh! lt's Milos. You like? Look, now l'm just a regular guy. l'm a nobody, like Oliver. Brilliant! Hey! - You did this for me? - l did this for us. Ohh, you're so sweet. But could you please be sweet without the accent? l don't like! lf it mak you happy, sure. Just a normal guy with normal friends eating normal pizza. - Excuse me, people, l'm ready to order. - (clamoring) Hey, buddy, who do you think you are? - Uh, well, actually, l'm... - Just a normal guy. ln Normalville we take a normal number - and wait our normal turn. - Oh, right. No sweat. l did this in an episode of Zombie High. ''Haunted Deli: Take a number and wait... to die.'' So, uh, what number are we? Uh, 32. - Number six! - Are you kidding me? Milos! Oh, sorry. Got it. Normal people wait. l'll wait. (ticking) This is endls! You know, let's go. (imitating Borat) Look like Milos has a little bit of temper. (shuddering) How do people do this? lt's agony! How long have we been here? Well, in one minute, it'll be exactly... ...a minute and a half. Thanks for letting me cut in front of you, sweetie. My boyfriend just got his tonsils out. (raspy) He can barely talk. Honey! What's taking so long? Did l say tonsils? l meant kidney. My mom has a Taser. (mimics buzzing) OK, then, bye. There you go, just what you ordered. ls it all better now? Totally. And don't it taste much better knowing you had to wait for it? Not really. Uh, you know, this ice cream is making me thirsty. Oh, boy. l said, this ice cream is making me... (muffled) Normal people get their own water. Really? Thanks, kid. See you at the movi. Mommy! - Run! - Why? - (Taser crackling) - Soccer mom with a Taser. l've never felt this way before. And l know you've only been in my life for a short time, but... ...heck, l'm just gonna say this. l love you. That's right. l love you, super secret Cheeze Jerky recipe. Silly, silly boy. (Rico yells) Well, as long as l'm here. Man, that's good! (exhal) What a rush! All night and no one recognized me. You know, l gotta admit l wasn't really sure l could do this whole normal thing. l've been famous since l was the face of Wonder Diapers. (all) ''The only diaper endorsed by astronauts.'' Did l tell you that already? You might have mentioned it once or twice. Or 30 tim. Anyway, it was a great night, except for this wig. l mean, it was worse than the one l wore on Teen Bigfoot. ''The only thing bigger than his foot...'' (all) ''Was his heart!'' - lt still gets to me. - lt's getting all of us. - Where can l take this wig off? - Upstairs. First door on the left. - Be right back. - Can't wait. Uh, Miley, we don't exactly know how to tell you this... - Jake's horrible. - Yeah, that's pretty much it. l don't understand. l mean, Hannah Montana's a star, too, but underneath Hannah is... is a real person, - and underneath Jake is... - Uh, more Jake? l really liked him. - How could l not see this? - Miley, none of us saw it. Come on, it's the first real time you guys have spent together. And now that l have... Yow! So what are you gonna do? Learn to love his flaws? Right. Like the adorable way he steals water from little girls. l have to break up with him, don't l? - l think so. - What if he gets mad? He could tell your secret. Guys, come on. Jake's a lot of things, but he's not evil. l'll tell you what, next time you people give me an itchy wig, l'll spread the word and put you out of busins. People try to ms with Jake Ryan, Jake Ryan plays hardball. So, what'd l miss? - (all) Nothing! - (cell phone ringing) Ooh, guys, come on. Let's watch me on TV. Look how cute Jake is. Why did you have to talk and ruin everything? OK, l've been thinking about your problem, and l got a couple ideas how to fix it. This isn't gonna be something stupid like move to Peru, is it? No! Please tell me you don't have ''face transplant'' on there too. (scoffs) Well, l wasn't... Fine. And now l have to go to another premiere with him and act like he's not the most obnoxious person l've ever met. l just wish l could find a way to get him to break up with me. l know. He'd break up with you in a second if you were half as obnoxious as he is. Lilly, you're a genius. Oh, thank you! Wait, was this about the Peru or the face transplant? - Peru. - l knew it! l just... Sometim... Oh, sorry, folks. We're all sold out. Oh, but don't worry. Come back tomorrow. There'll be plenty more. Yep, that's right, Rico. l'm turning 'em away. And look. lt's raining money. l can't watch this anymore. (sobs) Wait, wait, look, look! l'm rolling in money. (chuckl) (mocking cackle) What you doin'? Laughing like Rico and rolling in money? - You should try it, dude. lt's fun. - Oh, cool. Oh, but first, my mom gave me the receipts for all the suppli she bought and we gotta settle up. Please tell me the big one's for us. You might want to look away. Make it quick. - Jackson... - Just go! (sobbing) (sad cackling) (sobbing) And here com Jake Ryan with his not-famous girlfriend, Milky. - Uh, it's Miley. - Anyway, how do it feel to be a regular girl dating a big star? Hang on, Bri, l got a throat itch. - (snorting, hacking) - (shudders) Oh, yeah. Mmm, much better. You were saying? Wow, Jake, this one's a keeper. Oh, man, the lights are warm! l'm just gonna air myself out. Bam! l gus we know what happened to the ugly duckling. (shudders) (chuckl) Maybe we should just go inside. Oh, that's a good idea. But, uh, first l gotta... (deep breath) Oh, yeah! That feels nice. Yow! Anybody got a lawnmower? There's a breeze in Pittsburgh, if you catch my drift. - Put your arms down. - Why? Oh. Oh, man, that's embarrassing. l meant to braid those. Oh, my gosh, uh, l just forgot. We forgot to feed the cat. Let's go home. You don't have a cat, you silly goose! Maybe we can build one out of your armpits. (exhal) Jake, you haven't said a word the whole ride home. Did l do something wrong? Stop it, OK? l know exactly what you're doing. - You do? - Yeah, of course. l'm not an idiot. OK, fine. Maybe l went about it the wrong way, but... Little Miss Hannah Montana can't handle it - when it's all about Jake Ryan. - What? Yeah. You'll do anything to steal my spotlight. - Face it, you're jealous of me. - Jealous of you? Why, y, l am. l am a jealous egomaniac and you should dump me right now. You know what, l'll make it easier on you. (sobbing) Goodbye. (mouthing) Please, please, please. - l'm not gonna break up with you. - (mouths) Dang. Miley, we can get through this. You'll learn to not be jealous, just like l learned to be a normal guy. Oh, sweet niblets. You don't know what a normal guy is. What are you talking about? OK, maybe l'm not normal on the outside, but inside beats the heart of a kid just like you. That's from Teen Bigfoot. - So? - So... That's exactly what l'm talking about. Normal people don't say things other people wrote for them. Normal people don't steal water from little girls. Excuse me if l didn't know that. OK? The only reason l did this stupid normal thing was for you. You know what? l'm out of here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Being normal's not stupid. lt lets me have real friends, and it reminds me that l'm just like everybody else. And you like that? l love that. And l thought you did too. Remember when we met? You said that sometim you wish you had a normal life. Where's that guy? That's the guy l want for my boyfriend, not this. So how was the movie? Good night, Nurse Nickel, what are you wearing? Daddy, not now. Ain't seen that many feathers since your Uncle Earl and Aunt Pearl had their annual pillow fight. Well, if you didn't want to go out with me anymore why didn't you just tell me, instead of going all wooly mammoth at the premiere? Because l was afraid that if l dumped you you'd get so upset and you'd... What? Tell your secret? lf that's the kind of guy you think l am, maybe l will tell your secret. Here you go, darlin'. Fudge ripple's like a heartbreak airbag. Don't stop the hurtin', but it sure cushions the blow. l don't get it. l lie to my boyfriend and feel horrible. l tell him the truth and it blows up in my face. Maybe l should just give up guys for good. Oh, honey, not for good. Just until l'm dead. Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. lt wasn't the truth or the li that caused all this. lt was the boy. He just wasn't the right one. l gus you're right. But you know what's weird? Now that Jake's gonna blow my secret l don't know which one l'm gonna miss more, my normal life or the guy l thought Jake was. Well, honey, no matter what happens, we're gonna make it through this. We always do. At least l know one big, handsome guy who will always love me. Who dat? Oh, me. - (man) Hello? - Back here. - Delivery for Miley Stewart. - Really? Thanks. Now who would be sending you flowers? (Jake) Dear Miley, l thought about what you said and you're right. l do wish l was a normal person sometim. l just don't know how to do that yet. But when l figure it out, l hope l'll be worthy of someone as terrific as you. And, don't worry, your secret will always be safe with me. ''Love, Llie.'' Who in the Sam Heck is Llie? A friend. A very good friend. Well, let's hope it's not another actor. What are you doing here? What are you talking about? l work here. - But l fired you. - No, you didn't. Sure l did. And then you opened that shack. What shack? But... But... But it was right over... And you... (stammers) And Oliver. And chee jerky, and l was in a baby stroller. lt's gonna be OK. Let me take you home. But you rolled in money. Sure l did. Thank you, l love you too. Good night, everybody. (chanting) Hannah! Hannah! You guys want more? You all are awome. l'll sing all night long if you want me to. - Let's kick it, guys. - (music starts) # You want some toast? l bet you do # Please add some jam and butter too # We're out of grape So sad # lt's all your fault, you bad dad - You know what, son? - Yeah, Dad? You got nerve! There she is, six encor. The voice that wouldn't stop. (raspy) Well, they were such a great... (clears throat, still raspy) They were such a great audien... Well, this isn't good. Here. Try some of this. (voice cracking) (squeaking) Help me. # Come on! # You get the limo out front # Hottt styl, every shoe every color # Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun # lt's really you but no one ever discovers # Who would have thought that a girl like me # Would double as a superstar # You get the bt of both worlds # Chill it out, take it slow # Then you rock out the show # You get the bt of both worlds # Mix it all together # And you know that it's the bt of both worlds # (chuckling) (voice cracking) # Do, re, mi, fa, so... So not working! And it won't work if you keep talking. You know, honey, this used to happen to me all the time when l was out on tour. And the only thing that would help was when your mama made me stop and not talk for a while. l can do that. - Mile. - What? You're talking. Dang! Oh... Dang! There you go. Now listen, keep it like that or we're gonna have to cancel the big concert on TV Saturday. (whimpers) That's our girl. Now, if you need to say anything for the next couple of days, use that. Hannah Montana has never canceled a concert before and she's not about to start now. l know that would just break your heart. And when your heart breaks, baby sis, so do mine. ''You got a hot date for the concert, don't you, Jerkson?'' - Dad! - She wrote it. (scoffs) l can't believe you think l'm that selfish, l'd... - What's her name? - Jenny, and she's a total babe. So put a cork in it, froggy. l got a lot riding on this. Uh-uh-uh! Use the pad. Couldn't have said it better myself. Miley, l know you want to get better, but sucking on those lollipops won't do anything but rot your teeth. - Mm-mmm. - Mm-hmm. Mm-mmm! (grunting) Miley, release. Fine. You leave me no choice. (deep breath) Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle! - (muffled laugh) - Ha! (grunts) Wow, a week without talking. That's gotta be tough for a girl. Not guys, we're different. l can not talk for a month. Wouldn't bother me. Girls, talk, talk, talk. ''Hey, Sally, nice capris.'' ''l love your purse...'' Oh, now that's just rude. Miley, l know this is gonna be hard but you just have to stop fighting it. We'll be here for you until you get your voice back. - Hey, Lilly, you want to catch a few? - Oh, yeah! (whispers) Please... (whispers) Thank you. You know, this is nice. Just sitting here enjoying the sun, the beach, the frh air. That's the thing about nature. lt is just so quiet and peaceful. Not like the constant noise you get when you're in the city. (imitat horns and sirens) Pull the vehicle over. Pull... l know. Driv me crazy too. - Hey, Oliver. - What up, Dex? Miley, feeling better? Great. So, um, maybe if you're not busy Friday night we can go to the movi or something? l got this one for you. (chuckl) ln your dreams, uh, Poindexter. We're playing hard to get. Ow! OK. What she meant was, Movi schmovi. Just plant one on her right now, big boy. Ow! Will you make up your mind? You know, we're sending Dex mixed signals, and he's... Maybe another time. ''Four score and seven years ago'' was the beginning of what famous speech? Finger on my hand, find the smartt in the land. Beep, beep, beep, beep... Keep sliding, Oken, l can still see you. Miley, make me smiley. Oh, l got this one for ya. Miley's answer is ''The Bettysburg Addrs.'' (scoffs) l think she means ''Betty Burg's addrs.'' Who's Betty Burg? What? The only other thing on here is ''l heart Dex'' and l'm not gonna say that with him sitting right there. Oops. OK, it'll be one week in exactly three... two... one... Speak. l know you're scared but we gotta find out sooner or later. Dad's right, Mil. Mil? Oh, great. Now she can't hear either. You are falling apart just when Jenny and l need you the most. That is so like you. Will you shut it already? l'm nervous enough and l don't know if l can... - l can talk! - Y! - Whoo! - Yeah! Oh, it's so good to hear your voice again. ''l heart Dex''? The last thing you want to do is overwork it. ''Betty Burg's addrs''? Oh, man, did you make her look dumb! - ''Plant one on her right now, big boy''? - Like you weren't thinking it. OK, now we know Miley can talk. Let's see if Hannah can sing. (singing Life's What You Make lt) (mimics guitar riff) Oh, Jenny, isn't the concert wonderful? What's that? Oh, you bad girl. (# Life's What You Make lt) (voice cracks) l'm sorry, Miley, but this problem's not going to go away on its own. lf you ever want to sing again, l'm afraid you're going to need surgery. (raspy) Surgery? - Really? - Trust me. We're talking about a very minor operation. - l could do it blindfolded. - (shrieks) l won't. l'm just saying that l could. Not that you'd know. You'd be out cold. Don't that make you feel better? lt don't, do it? l should stop now. (raspy) You think? l'm sorry. l'm just trying to reassure you that this surgery is no big deal. One hour in my office, one week in recovery, you'll be as good as new, OK? - OK. - Really, l mean, the chanc of anything going wrong and permanently losing your singing voice are one in a million. Oh, boy. (raspy) One in a million? What if l'm that one? Doc, you were this close. When l say one in a million, it's just a figure of speech. l haven't done anywhere near that many. Uh, not that l haven't done a lot, because l have. l'm going. Daddy, there was a one in a million chance you'd be a rock star and that happened. There was a one in a million chance l'd be a pop star, that happened. Face it, this family's one in a million central. Hey, Mile, l really think you're overreacting. This guy's one of the bt surgeons in the country. Yeah, Dad's right. Bid, what do you think's gonna happen? Just as the surgery's about ready to start, a meteor hits a bus. The bus driv into a hot dog stand, a giant neon wiener fli into the power lin, the lights go off in the operating room, and the next thing you know, you're spending the rt of your life singing like Aunt Pearl after she swallowed that kazoo. (coughing, imitat kazoo) (raspy) Oh, no. l'm never gonna be Hannah Montana again all because of a giant wiener. (Robby) Here you go, Miley. Why don't you open this one next. Y! Just what l wanted. Now l can be just like Daddy. Let's hear something # Rock rock rock! Yeah yeah yeah # Rock, rock, rock! Ohh yeah! # l love you Tennsee! Good night. Drive careful. Did you hear that, babe? This little girl might just end up giving you a run for your money. Maybe one day l'll have to take you up on stage with me. (both) Encore! Encore! Encore! # Jingle bells, Jackson smells # From 50 mil away, PU! - (Jackson) l'm gonna get you, runt! - (screaming) - Hey, no running in the house. - (crashing) - (Miley) He did it! - (Jackson) She did it. Don't you just love Christmas? Hey, Mile. l made you a cup of my famous loco hot cocoa, with little marshmallows so you don't choke-o. Choke-o. Choke-o. l'm gonna keep saying it until you laugh. Choke-o. Daddy, what if something go wrong in the surgery and l can't be Hannah Montana anymore? Well, then, l gus you'll have to pack your bags and get out. Baby, that's not gonna happen. Everything's gonna be fine. Only thing you need to worry about is what flavor ice cream you're gonna be scarfing down after. How do you know that? 'Cause there's some things in life a daddy just knows, like l know the sun's gonna come up tomorrow morning. Uncle Earl's never gonna be an underwear model. And l know your voice is gonna be fine. You get some rt now, bud. - Good night, Dad. - 'Night. - Love you. - Love you. Miley! Where is that usels freeloader? Right here, Daddy. l thought l told you to iron the socks. You know how l like a nice crease in my hosiery. Sorry, Daddy, l'm still cleaning the oven. Wait a minute. What's that on the corner of your mouth? Have you been eating the burnt bits off the broiler pan again? Sorry, Daddy. l'm just so hungry. Mmm! Month-old trout skin. My favorite! Well, quit stuffing your face and get to ironing. Just because that surgery caused you to lose your singing voice don't mean you can lay around here licking up trout drippings like the queen of Sheba! But l can sing, Daddy. l've been practicing. Listen. (sings This ls The Life off-key) (bellowing) Don't ever do that again. (muffled) OK. Now there's only one person in this house that can sing and we all know who that is. # Jingle bells, Miley smells # From 50 mil away # Yeah! Ladi and gentlemen, please welcome Bucky Kentucky! Thank you! Thank you. But Jackson could never sing. And Bucky Kentucky? That's the dumbt name l've ever heard. You're just jealous 'cause you don't have a state that rhym with your name anymore, Little Miss Nobody. Oh, please, like anyone would ever be a fan of Bucky Kentucky. (gasps) Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Bucky Kentucky. lt's Bucky Kentucky! Dude, dude, dude, dude, you rock. l love you! Guys, what are you doing? lt's Jackson. l'm sorry, did you hear something? Yeah. Sounds like a washed-up pop star. - (all laughing) - Let's go, kids, or we're gonna be late for Bucky's big concert. The limo's waiting. Ooh! Last one in's a Miley! Guys, what about me? l should be going to the concert too. l was Hannah Montana once. Please don't treat me like this. l have feelings. l'm not a piece of furniture. Guys. l'm not a piece of furniture. OK, maybe l am. (car horn honks) Hang on, kids, l just gotta grab my keys and my wallet. Oh, there they are. Daddy, what happened to me? l'm nothing but a table. Oh, honey, you're much more than that. You're also a coat rack. Sweet niblets. We'd love to take you along with us, Mile, - but you just got too many hang-ups. - (laughter) (Jackson) That's a good one, Daddy. l told you l was funny. No! Don't leave! Somebody help me. Please? (woman) Baby girl, you always did have the strangt dreams. Mama? - Mom! lt is you. - (chuckling) - Sorry. - (sighs) Your daddy gave you some of his loco hot cocoa before bed again, didn't he? He knows what sugar do to you. Oh, l swear, when l'm finished here, l'm popping into one of his dreams. He is gonna get an earful! Not helping. lt's your dream, sweetpea. lf you don't like it, all you have to do is change it. lt's not that easy. Hey, maybe it was. Where were you when l was eating trout skin? All right, baby girl, we both know you didn't dream me here to ask me that. Why don't you tell me what's really on your mind. l lost my voice. And if it don't come back, then... - Then... - Miley. Do you really think if you're not Hannah Montana you're no better than a piece of furniture? (groans) Look at that thing. l swear, there's nothing more dangerous than your daddy with a pockettul of cash and one of Uncle Earl's garage sal. Mom, if l can't sing then l'm just... l'm just Miley. (sighs) And what in the world is wrong with that? l think ''just Miley'' is pretty darn terrific, and l know she is strong enough to handle anything. - She is? - Heck yeah. lt's the way your daddy and l raised you. You're a wonderful girl, and that's why your friends love you so much. What friends? You saw the way they treated me. Oh, for heaven's sake, Lilly, Oliver, get in here! lf she wasn't Hannah Montana would you still be her friends? Are you kidding? Of course we would. Miley, you were my bt friend way before l knew you were Hannah Montana. Why'd you all just walk out on me? - (scoffs) - (both) lt's your dream. And it was only scary because you're so worried about that surgery tomorrow. lt's true, Mil. ln real life, l sing like a starving walrus. Mom, this is where you say ''Oh, no, you don't, honey.'' Oh, no, you don't, honey. Just a regular walrus. A cute, tone-deaf walrus. - Thanks. - l like your mom, she's funny. She's pretty, too. That's it, you're out of here. Hey, why am l leaving? l don't want to go. Stop! This is not fair! The point is, whether you're Hannah Montana or just Miley, you're still gonna be the annoying, obnoxious little sister... ...that l love. OK, you can wake up any time now. l ain't done yet. You see, no matter what happens to your voice, you have the most important thing a person can have, - people who care about you. - You're right, Mommy. You think? Oh, what the heck? Oliver, get back in here. Thank you. You were loved before you were Hannah Montana, and you'll be loved long after Hannah's on one of those ''Where are they now?'' shows. l think you're confusing me with Dad. Oh, l am not worried about you one bit. - l miss your hugs, Mom. - Oh, baby girl. They're never far away. All you have to do is think about me. Now, listen... ...say goodbye to your friends and get some sleep. You did good, honey. Oh, you're doing a pretty good job yourself... ...except for that hot chocolate before bed! Yeah, about that. l know you always told me not to do that, but this was a very emotional... Miley, you can wake up now. Robby Ray, how many tim do l have to tell you? Miley, wakey wakey! Cannot believe you still have that table. No wonder the girl's having nightmar. Sorry, darling. You know l always was a pushover. That you were. (singing You and Me Together) Don't be scared, baby girl. The surgeon did a wonderful job. Your voice sounds better than ever. (singing together) (joins in singing) Jackson, cut it out, boy. Hey, it's your dream. Not this time. Well, if it's not your dream and it's not mine, then whose is it? l think l know. (gasps, then sighs) Mama was right about that hot chocolate. Mmm. That was Mikayla with lf Cupid Had A Heart. Her first top ten hit. All you need now is another dozen to match the record of Hannah Montana. What do you think, Hannah? She got the right stuff? - Totally, Colin. She's great. - Thanks, Hannah. That means a lot coming from you. l'm welling up at the love and rpect l feel between the two princs of pop. Well, l think there's enough room in the music world for both of us, right? Absotively posilutely. Adorable. You're not gonna want to miss the two sharing the stage next week at the United People's Relief charity concert in Florida. We'll be right back. l'm Colin Lassiter and this is The Real Deal. (man) And we're out! Speaking of relief, l've got the bladder of a kitten. lt is so great to finally meet you. l really am a huge fan. Yeah, l hate you. Thanks. l feel the exact same... What? Your voice is stenchy, your music is stupid, your outtits make me want to puke on 'em, but it looks like somebody already did. OK. l don't know what your problem is... My problem is, is l'm ten tim better than you and you're gonna find that out in Florida. Miss Hannah, l'm taking all your fannahs. OK, listen here, you one-hit bobblehead, the only thing you're taking from me is lsons, OK? Lson number one, this... is how you do the head thing. Yeah, that's right, l went there. - Well, you know where l'm gonna go? - Down the toilet with your career? That's right, l went there again and this time l bought property. Back up, kid. And don't go shooting off your little tweenybopper mouth at my client, OK? - She started it. - Yeah, and l am ending it, Little Miss Soon-to-be Used-to-be. Whoa, Nellie. l don't know who put the burr underneath your saddle but no one talks to my client that way. - lt's OK, Dad, l can handle it. - You heard her, Zeke. Why don't you go wait out in the wagon? - Excuse me? - Oh, and while you're at it, you might want to shave the ferret off your face, OK? l shave mine when you shave yours. That's right, l went there. (man) We are back in five, four, three... Great story, Hannah! (chuckl) Hey, we're back and we're having some fun now, aren't we, girls? Oh, yeah, l just can't wait till Florida. Neither can l. # Come on! # You get the limo out front # Hottt styl, every shoe every color # Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun # lt's really you but no one ever discovers # Who would have thought that a girl like me # Would double as a superstar # You get the bt of both worlds # Chill it out, take it slow # Then you rock out the show # You get the bt of both worlds # Mix it all together # And you know that it's the bt of both worlds # (chuckling) l cannot wait to get to that concert to show that two-faced tone-deaf toad who's boss. But you have to wear something amazing. Mikayla always looks incredible! For a two-faced tone-deaf toad. l don't care what Mikayla wants. lt's a benefit concert and all the girls are sharing one drsing room. Go Daddy, go Daddy. l don't think so. Because unlike you and your ''kinfolk,'' my client didn't grow up in a barn and we're expecting our own drsing room. Oh, l can see why you would need more room. l mean, where else are you gonna put Mikayla's ego and your big mouth? Step off, goober. - Oh, darn, l'm afraid l'm losing you. - (crunching) We're breaking up. l know that trick. You're crunching potato chips. They're corn chips, and you're not getting another room. And that's the way Robby Ray rolls. Well, uh, could Robby Ray roll out some cash? Hannah needs a new outtit for Florida. l thought you were gonna wear that snazzy silver drs. Dad, please, get with the tim. That's so yterday. That's because yterday's the day you bought it. What about the one you bought at the place next to the place? - No, that's too... - You're right. - When you wear that you have to... - l know. l hate those. What about the one l bought after the one l bought at the place? That go with the sho with the things? l love that. Me too. Do you even know what we're talking about? No, but as long as it don't cost me a wad of cash l'm all for it. - Your dad is... - l know! (Jackson grunting) (grunting continu) (grunting) Push! Push! Push! Son, are you working out on that contraption or giving birth to it? Laugh all you want, old man, but when the guns come in there's gonna be a new sheriff in town. Pow! And a new deputy. Bang! When l was a kid we didn't have money for stuff like this. You know what we lifted? Cows. And when it rained we went inside and lifted your Aunt Pearl. Try lifting her up after a bowl of her homemade pinto bean soup. Talk about your bang! pow! Are you saying that this isn't a workout? l'm not saying that at all. Thinking it, but not saying it. All right. Well, l'd like to see you give it a try, Flabio. OK, but don't come crying to me when l break your little rubber band toy. (grunts) You know l'm just kidding you, right? lt's not set for your height and weight. Fine. Then set it for my height and weight. Matter of fact, crank it up to Aunt Pearl. l'd like to see the rubber band toy that can handle Robby Ray! (groaning) Oh, gosh. Hey, Dad, look, this is the drs l'm going to wear. What happened? (imitating Schwarzenegger) Mr. Puny-verse got a butt-whupping from a little itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny little rubber band. l'm gonna get to feeling better soon. When l do, l'm coming after you. Oh, no, l better run! (very slowly) No! You look terrible. Are you gonna be able to make it to Florida? Lilly, he is obviously in pain. We gotta show a little concern. Daddy, can l get you an ice pack, a pillow? Are you gonna be able to make it to Florida? Don't worry about me, honey. l'm gonna be fine. (scoffs) l doubt it! When my dad's back go out, he can't move for days. He just sleeps on the dining room table. Last Thanksgiving, we had to eat around him. He had a muscle spasm. (whispers) Giblets everywhere. (groans) Roxy, this treatment better work. Otherwise l can kiss Florida goodbye. Oh, no problem, girl. There's never been a jacked-up back that Roxy couldn't crack. You know, l feel better already. This treatment is starting to do the trick. That's not the treatment. This is. - (screaming) - (cracking) l think the machine broke. That... wasn't... the... machine! Oh, l'm gonna be sick. Oh, Daddy, l am so sorry. l was just trying to help. lt's OK, Mile. Hey, l know you had your heart set on putting that Mikayla in her place but there's no way l'm gonna be able to sit on a plane for five hours. l gus you're right. Unls l strap you to a surfboard and check you through baggage. Why don't you just take him in a coffin? At least they're padded. That's a great idea. Get him a portable DVD player. Time will just fly by. Perfect. Ain't gonna happen. Let's face it. You tried, Roxy tried... Roxy. That's a great idea, Daddy. Roxy can take me. (groans) No, no. No way, honey. Why not? Roxy's taken me to plenty of concerts before. Not all the way across the country. Bid, if l'm not there with you Mikayla's manager's gonna steamroll right over you. Come on, Dad, l can handle Mikayla and her manager. And l'll have Roxy. Remember, ''Roxy like a puma''? Honey, we can't. You're still just a kid. But l'm your kid and you taught me how to stand up and fight for myself. And l'll have Roxy. Face it, Dad, it's all falling into place. Not for me it isn't. Why not? You know l can do this. You can trust me. - But that's not the point. - Then what is the point? The point is you're not ready to do this on your own. Y, l am, Daddy, and you know it. Come on, Dad, let me go, please. l don't wanna talk about this anymore. - That's not fair! - l don't have to be fair. l'm the dad and l'm not letting you go. Why are you treating me like such a baby?! - Because you're acting like one. - But Dad! No, Miley, not another word. Fine. How about three. l hate you! Miley! Miley Ray! Do this mean l'm your favorite kid now? (muffled grunting) l'll take that as a y. l have never said anything like that to my dad before, but he wasn't making any sense and l got so mad and... (groans) l hate him for making me say l hate him. This is terrible. Now Mikayla's gonna have that stage all to herself. Lilly, l'm upset enough. The last thing l want to think about is... (woman on radio) Mikayla, coming at you with her new hit single lf Cupid Had A Heart. Rico, could you turn that down? - l'm sorry. ls it bothering you? - Yeah. Well, then, this will drive you crazy. - (rais volume) - (# lf Cupid Had A Heart) (grunts) (cell phone ringing) (groans) Speak of the she-devil. What is it, Mikayla? Hannah, l heard you pulled out of the concert. What happened? Did the big pop star get scared? Listen, Micockroach, one of my family members has a serious medical condition, OK? Yeah, it's you, and it's called wimpo-titis. That means you're a wimp. l know what it means. Oh, l can see the headlin now: ''Mikayla rocks while heartls Hannah hid from the homels.'' The concert's for hunger relief. Like l care. Either way, l'm gonna steal all your fans and there's nothing you can do about it. Oh, yeah, there is. l'm gonna be there. - You are? - You are? Y. And you better wear something absorbent 'cause l'm gonna be wiping the stage with you. That's right, l went there. You can't go to Florida without your dad. Watch me. Wow. (Miley) ''By the time you read this, Roxy and l will be on our way to Florida. And when l come back, l'll take whatever punishment you decide to give me like the grownup l'm trying to convince you l am. PS: Don't blame Roxy. She don't know. '' Dangflabbit! Jackson, get down here and help me get out of this thing! (groans) Come on, Dad, not another sponge bath. Haven't l done enough? - Not until you get me to the airport. - OK. - Maybe we should change first. - Good idea. (man) Sorry for the delay, folks. We'll be leaving the gate momentarily. Thank you for your patience. Mmm! Warm cashews, cold shrimp. Oh, and complimentary slippers. Time to let the dogs out. Great. l'm glad you're enjoying the flight. lt'll be a whole lot better once we take off! Come on, flyboy! l can walk to Florida quicker than this. Come on! Sweetheart, could you keep it down? Someone just complained. - Who? - Me. Now zip it. Thank you. Ooh, channel 21 is all Barry White all night. (deep voice) Ooh, baby, baby. (man) Flight attendants please close the doors - and prepare for takeoff. - Y! Excuse me. l'm looking for my daughter. Sweet niblets. l was... just making sure all the carry-ons were stowed properly. No need to thank me. Sensible sho. Good choice. (chuckl) l really don't like you. Please take your seat. Thank you. Miley? Mile? Mile? (gruff voice) l was just visiting my grandkids in Palm Springs. Did you? Pardon me, dollface. Gotta make a pit stop. Roxy? - Roxy... (grunts) - Hyah! Well, hello. Robby Ray, what are you doing here? - Oh, no, she didn't. - Oh, y, she did. She bamboozled us both. Well, your bam is easy to boozle. You still don't know l sneak over to your house - and use your hot tub on the weekends. - What? Enough of this chit-chat. Let's find that girl. Hey, this bathroom's ocupado. Sorry, dollface. You're really supposed to keep the closed. l may shift during flight. You're gonna shift right now. Get out here! Come on, Miley. Get that thing off your head. We're going home. - But, Dad... - No but. Now. Excuse me, ma'am, but we'd like to get off. And l'd like a job where l don't have to smile all the time no matter how annoyed l am. Now, the doors are closed and no one's getting off until our first stop in Denver. So please take your seats. - But... - l said please! Miley Stewart, l have never been so disappointed in you. You think you're disappointed now? Wait until you see your snack box in coach. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Listen, kid! You have a fantastic sense of rhythm. You must be very proud. - Big dad? - Huge. With a mohawk. Gee, why would l want to hang out with my friends when l can spend five hours being kicked in the back by the kangaroo kid and drooled on by Jabba the Gut? Don't blame me. Blame your sister. You're the one that wouldn't let her go in the first place. Don't start with me, son. She wasn't ready to go. She wasn't ready, or you weren't? - Excuse me? - Come on, Dad. l mean, you raised us to believe we could do anything we set our minds to. And the whole time we were growing up, you told us, ''l know you can do it. So get ready, get set, go.'' Why aren't you saying that now? Oh, yeah, l can be deep. Roxy, l really am sorry l lied to you. Hush up. l'm not talking to you. But if l was talking to you l'd be saying ''Don't apologize to me. Apologize to your daddy, because he only do what he do because he lov you.'' l gus l should apologize, shouldn't l? lf l was talking to you, l'd be saying ''Mm-hmm.'' l'd also say, ''While you're up, get me some two percent. Roxy lik to dunk!'' - l was just... - Me too. Daddy, when l said l hated you, - l was just... - l know. Honey, sit down. l think we need to talk. Man, l was hoping we'd just said it all. (sighs) Not quite. l think we both know what you did was wrong. We could talk about that later. Right now l have something l want to give you. A barf bag? lt has a song on it. l just wrote it for you. l know you didn't understand why l was acting the way l was acting. l didn't understand it either. But hopefully this will help explain. (# Ready, Set, Don't Go) Darlin'... ...no daddy ever wants to see his little girl grow up, but... ...every dad knows some day she has to. When this plane lands in Denver, l'm getting off and you're staying on and going to Florida. Are you sure? l've never been more sure of anything. Bid, Hannah Montana don't need her daddy to hang around to go down there and show that Mikayla what she's made out of. Oh, Dad.
