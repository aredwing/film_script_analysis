I'll get Howard on the line, he'll know what to do. Peggy... this is my choice. Peggy? Steve? Steve? Look sharp. Zodiac is on the move... crossing the white stone bridge in a green sedan. This enemy is considered armed and extremely dangerous. Two agents recommended. Please locate and pursue. Miller, Johnson, Wilkes. Let's take them down. How are you holding up, sweety? Quite bored, actually. Really? I thought we were keeping you pretty busy, around here. Well, while my expertise is in the field... code breaking and data analysis have always come easy to me. Well, we all just think you are doing a bang-up job. Agent Flynn, sir... it's been three months now... and I've yet to have be sent to my first assignment. Peggy, relax... war is over. We'll handle the rough stuff. They shot up your car. Sir, they came out of nowhere. We're gonna need a full analysis on all recent transmissions... by tomorrow evening, at the latest. How about yesterday? Carter! The boys and I were heading out for a drink. You want to polish up those field reports on my desk? I appreciate it, darling. Don't forget to lock up when you're done. What do you say boys, should we go to Nelson's? They got a nice Manhattans. We have a locked position on Zodiac. Four, zero, point six five one eight degrees north... seven, three, point niner five two two degrees west. This enemy will not hesitate to use lethal force. Three to five agents recommended. You guys want to handle this? My pleasure. Ma'am, you can't be here. We got a gas leak issue we're dealing with. A gas leak? No injuries, I hope. You're not from around here, are you? No, I live in Brooklyn, actually. Drop it. Take this. Turn and move. Where's Zodiac? End of the hallway, on the right. Drop! Hands up. How many men? Four. Four, including you? Now, I need you to scream for help. Help! I need help! Guard the Zodiac. Yeah. You, come with me. Help! I need help! Somebody please help me! Somebody help! What happened? Help! Help! Thanks, that's enough. One to go. Hey, what's going on out there? Let me out! Learn to count. Okay. What the hell do you think you're doing? Well, I was about to start some data analysis and code breaking. Don't get cute with me, Lady. You took a mission, last night. I completed a mission, last night. Without even attempting to report in, or get the proper authorization. The mission was time sensitive. There are protocols in place. No one is above protocols... not even Captain America's old flame. How dare you? Please, let's stop pretending, shall we? Everyone knows why you're here. Please, enlighten me. You were grieving... so they kept you on, so that you would feel useful. I call it pity. If they wanted to make me feel useful... they wouldn't have made me work with you. You're gonna answer for that. Who am I speaking to? This is Agent Flinn. This is Howard. Sir, I wasn't expecting... I have orders for Agent Carter. If this is about last night... rest assured, she will be properly disciplined. I'd say that last night... more a notch in her belt, than a feather in her cap. Yes sir, what are your orders? Phillips and I want her to come to Washington. Say again? Tell her she will be running S.H.I.E.L.D. with me. Agent Carter? And Flinn... Yes, sir? let her know that you're honored to bring her the news. You want me to say that, verbatim? Hello? Mr. Stark? Agent Carter, it is my honor to inform you... that you are going to run S.H.I.E.L.D. And I'd also like to assist you in... carrying your personal items down to your car. Thank you, Agent Flinn... but as has always been the case, I don't require your help. It's called a bikini. A bikini? You invent it? No, the French. Bikini...
