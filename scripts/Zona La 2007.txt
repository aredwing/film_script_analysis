Maybe you've got the wrong number. Wait! Hurry up, motherfucker! It's my turn! I'll kill you, son of a bitch! I don't need this. If you want the other one, I have to get the whole thing. I just want the mirror. I already told you, asshole, take it apart, it'll break! Sergio, do you copy me? Where are you? Let's go, dude. I'm working. I'm paid to stay here all night. Don't be a fag! No one's going to know. OK. -What's up, man? - Come on. - Give it to me. - It's my boss's. Give it to me! Miguel! Where are you going? Don't move! Get your hands off! Everything! Overthere! Move overthere! It happened at Mercedes' house. Are you taking the car? I don't know. Is it far? Where are my keys? On the TV. I'll go with you. As long as you come home if things turn nasty. We don't know anything yet. Daniel's on his way. Where are you going? With Dad. Everything'll be ok. - Take care. - Sure. Stay with yourfather! - Do you hear me? -Yes. Yes, Laura, Alejandro's gone with his father. -Anyone hurt? - I don't know. They broke into Mercedes' house and killed her. They strangled her. There's a lot of blood. How did they get in? Through the kitchen from the back. She said it happened too fast. She couldn't do anything. It was dark. Calm down, Ricardo. Let's go inside. It was dark. I couldn't see anything. Where were you? In the kitchen. - How many were there? - Three. Are you sure? Yes. One got away. Try to remember. I watched them... Did they work here? In another house? Who? No. I don't know. - I don't know them. - How did they get in? I don't know. - Had you seen them before? - No. Alejandro! I have to go too. I killed the guard. We'll talk later. I knew him, Daniel! The guard. He was a good man. Give me the gun, Ricardo. You didn't kill anyone, OK? Those sons-of-bitches are the ones to blame. Your gun neverfired. Forget it and go back home. We'll take care of it. Wait for me inside. - Good morning. - Good morning. - How's it going? - Fine. May I? Be careful. We're recording everything today. No, there's no problem. Let me get in and see for myself. No, no. A billboard fell, there was a power failure that triggered the alarm. That's all. The caller reported gunshots. They must have come from the other side of the wall, as usual. Well, if nothing happened I'm sure you won't mind if we take a look. With all due respect, you need a warrant to come in here. - The street belongs to everyone. - Not this one. Take it easy, officer. Have some beers. I don't drink at other people's expense. A fucking cop with principles. What did you say, asshole? How much will it cost us to get you off our backs? Take it easy, Gerardo. More than you've got. Thanks foryour concern, captain. - That was a waste of time. - Did you find anything? Yes, but you can't see his face. Please, rewind! What's that? His trainer. The important thing is we know he's inside. - Tell Mom I'll be late. - OK. What's wrong? Don't forget it's my birthday. I'm sorry, son. I completely forgot. Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Take care. -You too, Dad. ... point five times is point five square root... Is that your dad? Take your seats, please. You're old enough to know how to behave. With 26 delegates present and substitutes from blocks 13 and 17. At 8:30 a.m., the meeting is open. In the event of violence La Zona residents will automatically lose all the special rights this law grants them. We all know the law, Gerardo. Article 6, paragraph A. We're all aware that the police can't discoverwhat happened. The lady seems to have forgotten. All I'm saying is that you should have waited. We won't lose our rights because of a stupid accident. If we go down that path, there'll be more stupid accidents. One guard is already dead. Order, please! Please! One at a time. Why don't we call Senator Ceballos? He was our neighbor. - He's a good lawyer. - No he's not. He's corrupt. And one always has to pay forthose favors. We have to fix this ourselves. We must find the murderer. We've got weapons. Let's use them. We'd only be defending ourselves. Daniel? The lights will be back on soon. The generator's been playing up since the storm. Dorita, is that you? Are you all right, madam? -You're late. - They wouldn't let me in. I had to go back for my ID. No problem. Help me make Alejandro's lunch. Yes, madam. They raped the maid and killed the old lady 'cos they couldn't fuck her. Who told you that? It's bullshit. How do you know? I was there this morning. That bastard's capable of anything. He deserves to have his balls cut off. I told you, he didn't rape anyone. Shut up! Fucking know-all! We can't have any more bloodshed. I don't get it. Why do you care about this fucking murderer? That trash killed Mercedes and would have killed your son if he'd got in his way. It's him or us. I just think we're going about it the wrong way. What should we do? Organize peace talks? He's a killer and he's armed. Whose side are you on? Don't be ridiculous! Can't I have my own opinion? You're on your own, Diego. We've discussed this enough. Lucia? Let's vote. Who's in favour of hunting down the killer? It's a serious situation for La Zona, too. He worked for us. He committed suicide here. If anyone finds out that he shot himself, you won't be able to collect the insurance. Do you understand? You can bury him here in our church. But I want to take his body home. You can't. I mean, it's not a good idea. We can handle everything here. You live here now, but maybe not tomorrow. Who'll let me see my husband when you've gone? Offer her more cash. It's not a question of money! Take your husband's body with you. Give herthe certificate. It says he died of a heart attack. You can't let anyone examine his body. Thank you. Go on. Edmundo! Do you copy me? Yes, don't worry about it. Thanks. See you tomorrow. They put a bullet in his chest. Pumped the poor bastard full of lead. So? - They're not coming. - No one is coming. They're all scared of the rapist. I told you, he didn't rape anyone. Bro, why don't we go after him ourselves? - The jackass is drunk. - I'm fucking serious. Let's go tomorrow. Didn't you hearwhat they said? We have to defend La Zona. Imagine if we found him. - Blow! - Make a wish! - Happy birthday, dear. - Thanks, Mom. It's from your dad and me. - Let's see. - I hope you like it. - Let me see... - The Barbie! It's the one you wanted, with all the mega-pixels. - It's great! - Let me see. You like it? Give me a hug. Careful! -You're growing up... - Thanks, Mom. - My son... -Where's Dad? He's still at Mercedes' place. -Are you having fun? -Yes. - Take this off. - It's betterthat way! I know. I've got three of these. You're my friend. You've always been my friend. And you always will be, brother. I just want to say... that that guy is a rapist. So, it's a deal. See you tomorrow. Let's get going. Bye. Let's go. Go home or come in. But don't stay outside. - Let's move it. -We're gone. - I'm going to see Dad. - No way. Mom, he's just there and the lights are back on. Here. I don't want the robber getting it. Don't be silly. There's no relative who can let us in? No, she lives alone, but she's away on holiday. - Mercedes Kier... - Kierkenian Levin. With two "K's". As you can see there was an accident. We've been having power cuts ever since the storm. We need to repairthe wall. So it was some lunatic who made the call? Remember, it's an offense to lie to the police. And offenses are paid for with bribes. Right, captain? I don't know. You tell me. It seems you've had some experience. Didn't you buy your special status to avoid misery? - I live here for security. - Captain. It was probably a sick joke. Probably. Excuse me. -Where are you going? - To the police. - I want no part of this. - Take it easy. They moved the bodies, hid everything. Where's the guard? -What did you tell his family? - Everything's sorted. Now's not the time. We'll talk later. Trust me! Please, Ricardo! I should never have had a gun. Motherfuckers! They can't even lie properly. Good night. I saw you at the gym. I voted the way I did because the police are useless. Outside, everything is more complicated. My brotherwas shot in broad daylight. The police took theirtime. He bled to death on the sidewalk. They caught some guys and I identified them. I told them to theirfaces: "That's them". They arrested them for murder. But afterthree months they were freed. They looked for me and they found me. Who gave them my address? They broke three of my ribs, my collarbone, all the fingers on this hand. My retina was detached. I'm not dead thanks to the neighbors. Violet, Geranium, Orchid... The golf course. OK, but we need more people forthe morning group. If I can get the day off work, I'm in -Anyone else? - Me. Good evening. The police have gone. What do you want to eat? I don't know. Anything. You didn't tell me this was the center of operations. Just until the police left. Should I encourage ourtask force with a drink? What's wrong? I don't know, you tell me! What's Mr. Architect going to do? Dress up in black and patrol the street with his accountant, my gynecologist and a gun? It's serious, Daniel. You have to tell the police. Don't be naive, Mom. They don't care about justice. Congratulations. You've taught him well! So now a manhunt is better than calling the police? And you should think before you speak. - I've got a harpoon. - What do you need that for? To spear him, asshole. He's a whale? I'll pickyou up early. OK, see you tomorrow. He's here! Come here! Alejandro, dinner's ready. Move and I'll kill you! Alejandro, dinner's ready! What are you doing? Nothing, Mom. I'm coming. Fuck! I stole it from my mom. -Awesome! - No, wait. No, man. Put it away, asshole. - Shall we go? - Let's do it! There he is! Where? There. - That woman isn't on vacation. -And this one? They brought him in at 2 a.m. Drink driving. He knocked someone down. - Did the victim survive? - No. He stays. They're very nervous. They're hiding something. -What about him? - No idea. He's been here a couple of days. Doesn't speak Spanish. - Find out what the charge is. -Yes, sir. - Sorry to interrupt, but... -You've got nothing, Rigoberto. They broke a glass. Someone heard gunshots. With this type of people you need hard evidence. What do you want to do? Torture them until they confess? I want to investigate. -Yes or no? - Do as you like. -And this one? -Armed robbery. There's no one here. - Let's go for some beers. - I bet he's hiding in the gully. - Come on! - Not the gully. It's too hard. You scared orwhat? Miguel... Alvarado... Estvez... -Age? - Sixteen. - That's him, in the middle. -Which one? Him. Is this the woman? Yes. Mrs. Estvez states that on Wednesday 10 at midnight, her son Miguel entered La Zona and has not been seen since. Tell them. We were at the mechanic's outside La Zona. -And you are? - Carolina, Miguel's friend. It was very windy, a billboard fell down. And they went in. Then I heard gunfire and they didn't come back. Were they armed? I don't know. So your missing Miguel is a thief. He is my son. They're firing at us. It's us, don't shoot! Don't shoot, it's Eddy! - It's Alejandro, don't shoot! - Don't shoot! What's wrong with you? Do you realize what you did? This isn't a game. This is serious. If you want to help, do it right. Get organized. No way, Gerardo! They're kids. Come here. They're adolescents. They won't ask permission. They'll do it anyway. If they're with us we can control them. - None of them's your son. - It's like they were. Mr. Daniel, Mr. Gerardo. Do you copy me? - The cops are askingfor you. - Shit. Gerardo. Go home. Don't go out until we talk. - Manuel, can you take them? -Yes, don't worry. -You shouldn't be here. - I didn't kill her! - Shut up! - I swear by my mother! Shut up! I'm not yourfriend. I went to see Carlos at the mechanic's. I just wanted to be alone with my girlfriend. I asked him for a place to be with her. But they started drinking... We were there for hours. Hands off! Catch her, asshole! Are you hungry? Lay a finger on my family and I'll kill you! I'll bring you something to eat later. But then you go, OK? You go! A different world, isn't it? You live in nice, clean houses. You've got your own district, now you want your own laws. It bothers you? That someone's luckierthan you? Have you seen him before? No. Someone talked. The day you said nothing happened, three robbers entered La Zona and I want to know where they are. If we're not under arrest, then let us go. Why don't you stop playing the fool and get this overwith? Let us go! What's happening now? Does he want money? He has a witness. Someone from inside La Zona. We could end up in jail. We need to talk to the police. - It was self-defense. - That's not an option. And in case you've forgotten, you voted yesterday. Maybe I was wrong. Order! Raise your hand if you want to speak. Someone screwed up, but we still have time. Without a witness, the police have nothing. Write down the names of possible informers. I don't suspect any of my neighbors. ...anyone who hasn't joined the search... - This is useless. - I have no objection. We need to keep looking forthe murderer. ...anyone who has contact with the cops... Are you crazy? Sit down, Lucia! I won't accuse those who voted for me. The most important thing is security for everyone. This has got out of hand. We haven't finished yet! We'll know who to blame if there are more leaks! The minority complies with the wishes of the majority. What did I do? Stop playing the fool. -You called the cops. - Did I say you could come in? I didn't call anyone. Hey motherfucker! - Give me your cellphone. - I'm not giving you anything! Dad? It's all right, Bruno. Stay with Mom. - Son of a bitch. - I didn't insult you. Take it easy, Gerardo. Nothing personal. It's for everyone's benefit. Get out of my house. You shouldn't have made that call. I'm sorry. Come in. Have you heard the latest? They didn't let me leave La Zona. I needed to buy my pills, but they wouldn't let me out. My wife is watching me. Is this what you need? We're all on edge. People are saying things. They're afraid you'll talk about what happened. Leave that there. Thanks. APPLICATION FOR WORK He hasn't shown since Thursday, but he didn't take anything. Just my gun. I have a license if you want to see it. It doesn't matter. If he shows up or calls you, let us know. Of course. - Did they kill him? - I don't know. And the assholes thought - It's going to cost them... - No way... I'm not going to let those bastards humiliate me! Wait here. Why won't you let it go, asshole? Did you record it? That's against the law. He's sleeping. You're a complete idiot. You could have got yourself killed. I don't want you involved. You're a minor. As long as you live underthis roof, you'll do as I say. - OK? - OK. You heard what happened at the gully? He told me. I didn't want Alejandro involved in the manhunt. What's that? Call him. The judge got us our special status. Let him help us now. That's not what the assembly decided. And what will they do if you catch him? What are they going to do? Do you want me to read yourfuture? We're all going to hell. Take them. So you can leave. What's your name? Miguel. It's not safe here, Miguel. They're looking foryou. - The cops? - No. Who? Everyone. They take the garbage away in the morning. You can hide in there. Go that way. But don't take the main street, it's full of cameras. Go through the alleys. Between the houses. Yes, madam... In your garden. Close all your doors and windows. We're sending a car over. Just for a moment. Go. You go that way. Over here! He's in here. Get out of there! It's too risky. You're going to shoot each other. Ismael, do you copy me? Get out of there! Hello? - Carolina, it's me, Miguel. - Where are you? They're going to kill me! What? They've got guns and they're after me! Tell my mom! Where are you? Tell me where you are! In La Zona. Over there. Apparently fired from different caliber guns. And here... one exit wound. Two exit wounds. He's been dead at least 24 hours. What's that? M... K... L... One of the bullets severed his aorta. Here's another one! The night watchman? Yes, it's him. M... K... L... M... K... L... Mercedes. Mercedes Kierkenian Levin! Keep looking! We're still missing a body! They were murdered in La Zona. - Shut up! You need evidence. - I've got it. -What about the driver? - He ran away. But his route takes him through La Zona. It's in his statement. There's one body missing. It might be in anothertruck. Keep looking. But keep your cool. I'll handle the press. Meet you back at the precinct. It was me. I broke it. It doesn't matter. We can replace the glass later. But for now, this is safer. - I'll finish it off if you like. -What? - I'll finish off here if you like. - No, I'll do it. Put some shoes on oryou'll catch cold. We need to find the driver. He's sure to squeal! -Are you sure it was ten to five? -Yes. I looked at my watch. Assholes. They're in for it now, motherfuckers! - Do we wait for De la Garza? -Just get the warrant. -We should let him know, sir. -Are you deaf? You stay here. You're ourwitness. Get the lady a coffee and some breakfast. Sit down. Hello! I want to talk to the supervisor. Do you hear me? Did Carolina tell you? Thank you for coming for him. Let me go with you. I can talk to him... ...get him to give himself up. Betteryou wait here. Come on. He's my son. He'll listen to me. Please! Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Dorita. I have to ask you forthe house keys. Why? It's not personal. For security. The assembly decided. I thought we made decisions together in this house. - Don't, Dorita. - It's just for a couple of days. Daniel! Where? Clearly no one cares about what I want. I'm coming. Excuse me. Come on! It's going crazy at the entrance. Get out of here! You must respect the autonomy of La Zona. Excuse me, we're working. Get out of here! Idiot, get down! It's official. La Zona defense force! These documents prove our exclusive status. Read them! Do they also give you permission to commit murder? With all due respect we have a job to do here. -You don't know what happened. -We're talking to you. You're beginning to piss me off. Let's talk, captain. That was yesterday, but you didn't want to. Listen to us! Then you can do whateveryou think is right. I'm listening. Not here. In private. - Not the gorilla. -What's your problem? Please, Gerardo. I'm going with you? OK. We need water. - Is Diego here? - In the yard, come in. Diego, the police just arrived. They're talking to them. Let's go! We have to tell them that we were against this. Wake up, Lucia. I don't represent anyone and they're looking for someone to take your place. But if we both go, they'll listen to us. You know, I was thinking... When my son grows up and asks me... How will I explain why we live behind a wall? -Water! - Get some more, son. Mercedes Kierkenian Levin is dead. - She's buried by the chapel. - They murdered her. The others were killed in self-defense. But there's a survivor. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, captain. Sorry I'm late. Delegate De la Garza. Is it recording? I think it would be better for all of us if this conversation wasn't taped. The captain is a good soldier. But he doesn't understand that wars are settled by negotiation. They want to confess. They don't want their affairs made public. Nor do you. Police brutality is a serious crime. It's up to you to keep yourfile private. Let's be practical. I'm sure you're interested in donating to our institution. Do we agree on the amount we're talking about? How did De la Garza get here so fast? I've got kids, captain. You son of a bitch! Two-fourteen here, do you copy me? For once I thought I was doing the right thing. We copy, captain. Let's all go to hell. The witness on the outside is your problem. Right, captain? - So, do we have an agreement? - Don't worry. The captain knows his job. They're leaving. Alejandro! It's him. What do we do? He's just a kid. If we beat him good, he won't steal again. Save him now, you'll have a murderertomorrow. Open up! Open up! That's an order! Please, open up! Gerardo, Daniel, do you copy me? I have the suspect in sight. He's close to the school. Miguel? What was that gunshot? How much did you get for my son's life? You should have raised him better. You sold yourself out, faggot! Control yourself, Rigoberto. Where? The power's gone. We've lost the picture. -Where's Miguel? - Come with us, please. - Is he alright? - Please. I told you to leave! I told you to leave! I tried to escape. I swear! They put them in trash bags. -Who? - My friends. They're dead. I saw them. The police didn't help me. It's OK. No one knows we're here. Take this... Clean yourself up. I've got two sisters and a brother in the north. It's just my mother here. Why you don't go there? I don't want to leave my mother alone. -What are you doing? - There's someone to see you. It's Yolanda, the guard's wife. My glasses... I told her everything. I'm sorry. I was afraid. It was an accident. It's a mercy he didn't commit suicide. Now. My name's Miguel Alvarado Estvez, I'm 16. On Wednesday the 10th of February, at night... I entered La Zona with some friends... ...to go stealing. Stay here. I'll be back. My name's Alejandro. Alejandro. Can you get the warrant? It's like I said. I know the address. Thank you, Your Honor. -Where were you? -With Mauricio. You're lying. He came looking foryou. What's wrong with you? - Nothing. I have to go. - In my car? You're not going anywhere. We're going to talk to yourfather. Come on. Dad! He didn't kill anyone. He's not even armed. -Watch this! -You lied to me. This is the bastard who killed Mercedes. Calm down! Calm down, please! Let's go to the gym to talk about it. - Please, please! - Murderer! - Stop it! - Calm down, calm down, please! Let's go to the gym to talk about it. Everyone to the gym. Calm down, please! Motherfucker! Calm down, please! - Please, stop it. - Calm down. We have to take a decision. Miguel! Miguel! Stop it, stop it! I hit her on her head. But she didn't die. It was Mario who strangled her. It's right that I go to jail. Because I'm guilty. Because I stole. But I didn't kill anyone. I just want to say I'm sorry for what I did. I'll never do it again. Here. His name was Miguel. Hello? Hello. I'm looking for someone who knows Miguel. There's no one here. Hello? Hello? Please, just tell someone Miguel is dead.
