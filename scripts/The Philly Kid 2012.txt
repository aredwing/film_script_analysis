So, is it true what my brother told me? - You never lost? - Yeah. You must be pretty good. You should come and watch. I don't really like fighting. Well, I gotta go. I have to catch the bus. - Good luck. - Thank you. - How about Italian food? - What ? - Do you like Italian food? - Yes Because I'm about to close up here and there's this really great place up on Eliyson. That place hasn't been up there for like, five years. But there's this great place on Broad. Hey, man, It's me. You're missing your party.

It's 20 years old, and I've got a shitty government salary. - Is it turning over? - Yeah. it's probably the battery. Can I see the Phillips wrench ? I already tried the connection. Okay, try it now.

One more fight. - Where did you get 8000 dollars? - You the IRS? Put it all on my boy to break Titov in half. - Where did it come from? - Come on, man. It's clean.

I didn't see this coming. - How does it look Doc? - Like he's been drugged. What ? Probably Rohypnol or some type of tranquilizer. Come on, no way !... I've been stitching fighters for 30 years, I know when someone's micked. Russian immigrants, they are ... they're dirty and everybody knows it. Probably had some shit in his gloves. It would take a shotgun to bring my animal down, right, D? Three to one! All he does is win! He's got a big fight. I already stitched his eye, but you're gonna have to keep him awake ... at least for the next eight hours because of the risk of concussion. Keep him awake? I can do that. I am a champ of it. How did I do? You did what you do. That's why I chose to train you. You did good, kid. Hey! You're falling asleep ? You're awake? You know what we should've done ? We should've invited that dirty Russian. Tina ! Come here ! - Hello, guys. - Give me a hug. This is the champ' right here. This is the champ'. Hey. We need to keep him up four hours. Ok Keep him up, come on! - D, get up and dance with her! - Come here, champ'. Another drink. Wow, man. What do you think are you doing? - Gimme the keys. - Are you even awake ? Stop messling around and give me the keys. - You can't even open your eyes. - Yes, get in the car, drunko. Come here ! You're really becoming to be a pain in my ass ! Two hundred thousand dollars ! That's what I'm due ! What are you talking about? Shut up! You were supposed to lose that fight! But L.A. Jim, he dropped the ball. So I had to eliminate him. 'Cause he was unreliable. I can't have unreliable. So now, I'm here to appeal directly to the source. You boys owe me two hundred thousand dollars. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I've got 10 thousand. You think I don't know everything? You've got 24. Which is mine. Which means you still owe me 176 000. I owe you shit! Come here. Open your mouth. Open it. Think. So we're clear ... You're taking the Titan to fight ... ... and you're gonna lose. In the second. Say it. Say it! Yes! Yes, I'm gonna lose! good to hear. I am owed. You'll be fine. She'll be allright. I'm gonna need some more hot water ... and towels. Take it easy, kid. Come here. Take her with you. I'm gonna make this right. You're a fucking monster. Let him out. Guards! If it wasn't for your brother ... I would be dead. Every week they came at me. I became a monster. Now that's that all I have left. It's all that I can feel. You're not a monster. I can feel the good in you. Even if you can't. And if I can' do this? We can. I check the county morgue, I find his name? Yes. - What was it? - Jim Jacoby. Also known as L.A. Jim . - And the cops ? - Marks. Ray Marks? You know, he called me in the morning. He said he was investigating a murder. Committed by a drug dealer named Ace Reed. He asked me to keep an eye on you, see if you seemed jumpy. Maybe like you would be leaving town. I'm telling you the truth. And if he frames Ace, it will be with this gun. I need your help. Shell casing on a cop is not gonna be enough. I'll give more. Let's say this is all true. Why don't you run? You know how many assholes jump their parole every month? Maybe you run, maybe I'm too tired to find you. -I can't leave. - Why not? I can't leave her. I can't leave her. I'm 3 to 1 in Biloxi. - If you put 300 000 on me ... - 300 grand ? You did your run already. Besides, my money's safe away in the bank. Why do I need another shot on a horse... - ... that probably can't even win? - For the same reason I do. To get out. Marks, he's gonna pin L.A. Jim on you. Is that right ? So how are we gonna skin this cat ? 300 000 on me to win ... and I want two of your guys ... and you must stay away from the fight. You must win the fight. You'll need more than a shell casing. Yes, but tell me in the I.A doesn't have a phonebook these guys. Can not hide forever. I want these photos on the web site tonight ... And get them to Allan in L.A. for the local TV press conference. 32, 33 ... 34, 35, 36, 37 ... He is still circling... Right there, see how he puts his head down when he shoots ? Watch this, watch this. Boom! Right there. Ladies and gentlemen, our judge has called a stop to the action ... in 2 minutes and 47 seconds in the very final round ... declaring its winner ... Johnny Rattlehouse Toothless! So, tell us about your new golden boy, Dillon McGwire. This really fight of a lifetime for Dillon McGwire. He was in need of a second chance and Crush decided to give it to him. One minute! Right. Remember, stay low, try to work your way on the inside. He will want some big shots. Watch him ... get ready to move. Right? Whatever happens, make sure she gets out. On the count of three! Let's make some noise! One, two, three! What the champions never do? Quit. He was a wrestling specialist... weighing one ninety ripple-y ... good muscle-y pounds ... Wait, friends. Wait for it. I see you at the end of the second round. Ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause ... Dillon McGwire! And here comes Dillon McGwire, the All American that was once considered ... one of the best amateur wrestlers in the world. This guy's a huge underdog tonight ... but he doesn't seem to recognize that. Look at the glare in his eyes. This guy is totally dawdling. And now, ladies and gentlemen, introducing his opponent ... seeking to maintain its title. Weighing tonight one hundred... and 88 pounds ... The Bayou Bomber ... Titan Powell! You know what, this guy scares the hell out of me every time I see him. You talk with him outside the ring and he's the nicest guy possible. But when he gets inside this cage, he's a complete monster. Hey, do not worry about it, it's all show. Despite the reputation of Titan ... I think we will see a very evenly balanced fight tonight. Neither of these guys is the kind to give an inch. And both of the guys are coming in undefeated tonight. But I just don't think Dillon McGwire has ever dealt ... with the type of power that Titan's gonna bring with his punches tonight. FEEL MY PAIN Okay, gentlemen. three three minutes rounds. Keep it clean. somebody taps, they're gone. Disengage, and go to your corners. When the bell rings, come out ready to fight. Touch gloves. First round. Chump. Fighters ready! Ready? Fight! Powell is going up for the guillotine early here. Dillon McGwire may be in trouble. Titan Powell is completely manhandling it. Get off! Let it go. Spilt, spilt. Ready? Fight! Get out, D! Here, here, here. Hey. Hey. Here are two twenties. You can take that to that guy over there? Thank you. It's allright. he's good. Take. Hey! Keep your hands up, he's fast! This is a beauty pageant for them. Sure, if he goes to the floor again he's gonna want to throw in a guillotine. Open him up. Make him fucking pay. Get at him ! Ready? Fight! I'm gonna break you, fish. Come ! A spectacular move ! Powell is seeking the guillotine again. D, get out ! don't take this. Powell is rocked! A punch in the eye, maybe two, before it closes completely. If the eye closes more, I stop this fight. Why not stop earlier this round? Look at Powell, he can barely stand... Ready? Fight! Dillon McGwire took Powell in a neck key. This may be the end. Good job, D! great gig. Thanks. Great fight. Ladies and gentlemen, we have just witnessed history. The giant has fallen tonight ... McGwire! Go. We have the suspect ... - Hey, man. - Hey! Come on, asshole. You have the right to remain silent. I know my rights. Anything you say or do can be used against you and ... McGwire I'll kill you! You hear me?! Take all of Titan Powell's off the website. I wanna bring McGwire front and center. Get on the phone with New York, let them know we just had the fight of the century ... broadcast to millions of homes and that this train is leaving the station ... with or without them. Dillon, that was amazing. I'm talking six figures. What is going on ? Where is he ? - Who? - Seriously, Jake ... I need to put an interview on the website before Tokyo wakes up. Yeah... I don't think he's gonna make it. He just fought the fight of his life ... We need to cash in. We did. Mr. Delano. All debts paid. Oh, Jakey. I knew that'd work out. Gentlemen. I don't wanna know. - Mail for you, Ryan. - Thanks. GONE FISHING. PRESS THE BUTTON.
