Before we move on to our next assignment, let's meet our new co-anchor the sexy, sultry Dilnaaz Bagga. Hi Dilnaaz. - Hi Raj. Hi everybody. You know, today is very lucky for Dilnaaz. Not because it's her first day on the show, but because I am introducing her. It's a joke. It's a joke, darling. You can smile. First on the show, you see. So tell me, Dilnaaz, you have a boy friend? That's not in this... - Someone you date. I know that. C'mon, don't be shy. It's British Raj. Tell us! There must be someone for whom you are willing to cross all limits. Actually... it depends. Depends? Really? For him, will you spend three hours of your life... on a movie that's beyond your comprehension? Yes, of course. - Will you do it everyday for a year? I mean, will you do it for 365 days? Everyday? A year? Yes, everyday. Today we are going to meet a warm Englishman... who has spent 1095 hours on Hindi films for the sake of his love. Our correspondent Akshay Kapoor is very anxious... outside the Baker Street police station to show you this exclusive. Over to you, Akshay. Hello Raj. I'm standing in front of the Baker Street police station, looking for an unusual lover. God knows why he is hiding from us. Let's find him. Officer, be gentle. Follow me. In relation, I am your father. The name is John Smith. By my mother I swear, I will pick each one of you and kill you! This is Inspector John Smith. His Hindi tutors include the famous writers... of the Hindi film industry like Javed Akhtar and K K Shukla. Inspector, what inspired you to learn Hindi? I fell in love. - Wonderful. What was her name? Ina, Meena, Dika, Anju or Manju? Monica! O my darling! So Inspector, how did your small love story begin? Would you come with me for the late night show? She worked for Symphony Theatre. Ticket window, you know. I used to buy tickets to catch a glimpse of her. Eventually ended up watching movies. In one year I learnt fluent Hindi. And I proposed to her. Lovers take the brides away. Then a quick wedding followed by kids. That's it. So that was Inspector John Smith's interesting filmy love-story. Akshay Kapoor for British Raj. Thank you, Akshay. How do you find the Bollywood type love-story of Inspector Smith? Do email us. - That's all. That's all on British Raj today.

But Raj... - I know, you can't believe it, right? But your beauty has the right to go out for dinner with me. Dinner? - I know. Only dinner can't fill your stomach. You can wait till breakfast if you wish. I like my eggs boiled. Don't be late. Okay? Raj... - Yes darling? Work, work, work! You look good. - Sure Rubina, my love, your husband is treating you well? Stop it. - What about you? I'll ring you soon Kathy, my love Looks like you're losing some weight. Smashing "Early morning," "what's come over me?"

Can you feel this? - Yes, I can feel this. But right now I can feel you getting out of my house. Who are you? Shivani Shivani or Akashwani, please leave my house. This is my house. - Really? Let's do something. Come, let me leave you back at the hospital. How did you know I came from the hospital? Your words clearly say that you've run away from a mental asylum. Besides, How did you enter my house? You stole Mr Bolting's keys? Come on, give me the keys. I don't need any keys. - Then how did you enter? Came flying? - Listen, just give me five minutes of your time. My story is very strange. But if you listen carefully, you might trust me. And at this point of time, your trust is imperative for me. Why this favour on me? You don't have a husband, boyfriend or a brain surgeon... who'd listen to your rubbish? - No. Because no one can see me. Except you. - What is this nonsense? Would you like to listen to my story? - Pardon? Please Will you go away if I listen to you? - You were right. I've come from the hospital. - I know that. I'm a doctor. I met with an accident six months back. How many did you kill? Ever since, I've been in coma. My body is in room number 303 of Thomwell Hospital. Finished? So you are a spirit? A spirit. Well beautiful spirit, if you have more friends, get them over tomorrow. I don't have time today. Now cut the crap. Akshay sent you, right? Akshay, who? You will know soon. Come on. I was kidding. Weren't you watching me? I was laughing all the way. Of course... I'm not serious either. I'm also laughing away right now. Hang on. Hello? - Who is it? Raj What am I doing? As usual at this hour, - Doing what? Getting beaten up by my wife. - And why so? Tell him. You'll kill me! Hello AK. Your friend Shivani is sitting right before me. She says she is in a coma. You have only 30 seconds to end this farce. Coming up is Shivani for you. Shivani, your time starts now. Hello? - I can't take the phone. I can't pick up things. Did you hear? - What did I hear? She can't pick up things. - Who can't pick up what? Okay Can you hear now? - I could hear then too. But I couldn't figure anything. My ears are ringing. Come on AK, I know you are trying to pull a fast one on me. And you know I'm not going to be fooled. Please speak and get out. Hello? Hi Akshay. I know you cannot hear me But your friend doesn't believe me. AK, answer her. - Who spoke? What should I answer? Hey AK, dude, this is really bad timing. Dilnaaz will be here in five minutes, - I'm going through bad times! My house is being vandalized. Can you hear? Raj, if I don't hang up, I will be martyred in my prime. Bye Raj. Bye? - Kuljeet. Relax please. Fine Which hospital? - Thomwell Hospital. Is there a ward for lunatics too? - Shivani Dutt, room number 303 Right Come on, let's go. - Really? You will go with me? If not, how will I throw you out? - Will you go just like this? Then how do I go? - Put some clothes on. Go as my cousin. Tell them you have to meet me tonight itself, since you got a flight in the morning. Simple, easy and it always works. Absolutely not. We follow rules here. But ma'am, I was just wondering... - Aren't you an Indian? Yes. - Does it hurt if you speak in Hindi? Ms Nurse, you are an Indian. You know the pain of separation from dear ones. I've come from India only to meet her. You are like my mother. Can't a mother breach a small rule of this huge hospital for her son? Only 15 minutes. And don't touch anything! Come. - Let's go Trapped Look, she is in a coma. She can hear what you say. Don't overact like you did in the lobby. Take it easy. And don't touch any thing! Okay? Yes - Have I made myself clear? Very. - Okay Twin sister? Mind-blowing! Whose idea was it? Mr Raj, it's me. Neither alive nor dead. Whoever you are, why are you dragging me into it? Don't know. Maybe a relationship of a previous birth. Pardon? Previous birth? At least you should've got your lines written well. But it's not your fault, you are just an actress. Okay guys, out with the cameras. I'm not going to be a scapegoat. AK, show up Listen Raj, I've told you! No AKs or cameras here Only I am here. - You are right And here's my body that's stepping towards death everyday. That's really sad. - Why don't you trust me? How should I explain? What do I do? Do whatever you have to. I am going home. Okay? What happened? Who are you talking to? So you are also in league? - With whom? With her With whom? - With her? With whom? - With her Tell me It seems you love her very much. She is loveable. All of us in the hospital love her dearly. If you wish you can sit for some more time. Insolent Relax Inspector Smith. It's absolutely normal. It happens with coma patients. If she opens her eyes it doesn't mean... she is conscious. She still is in a coma. Look, this is her cerebral cortex which is severely damaged. Have a look. She is lucky, her brain stem is fine, because of which there are movements. She can open her eyes, but she cannot see anything. She cannot think or feel anything. How long, doctor? - Can't say A month, a year, maybe all her life. No hopes of her getting well, Inspector. The world live on hopes, doctor. Hi One shot from here. - See you later. See you Lip stick please. - Hi Good morning Dilnaaz, last night... - You were about to ruin my life! 3idane's head wouldn't have hurt so much. Aren't you ashamed? You call up a married man at night and ask him to talk to a girl. And you don't even let her talk! - I called you last night? Akshay, get out of here. I'm ready to roll. Pass the papers, baby. Action. - Hello and welcome to British Raj. Today's top story; From Spark To Fire. An 18-year-old girl, in a fit of rage, torched her boyfriend's brand new Porche. Why did she do it? Good question. Because her boyfriend dared to come four hours late. What do you think, Raj? Did Pooja do the right thing? Or was she overreacting? Well, you know... - Don't you think that... he got a mild punishment? I mean, don't you think she should've set her boyfriend afire? Pardon? - That's not in script. What does he think of himself? To make a girl wait for hours alone... in a restaurant, is that decency? I'm sorry. - It's disgusting. I say, he should be castrated, not set afire. Ouch Now come on, Dilnaaz. It's a family audience. It happens sometimes. Your boyfriend... I mean, Pooja's boyfriend must've been helpless, held up with some problem. - Problem? What kind of problem, Raj? Come on, it happens... You? Hello. I? - Who are you? Wow! So who am I now? - Okay, cut it out, guys. This is too much. I told you, I'm not going to be fooled. C'mon, out with it. Who sent the girl to my house? I see. So there was a girl with you last night. Yes... I mean no... - That was your problem. Hey, stop right there! Don't come in front you camera. What's wrong with him? He doesn't do drugs. Don't block... Ghost! - Ghost? Am I? - What is he saying? You don't want to know! - Look Raj, I didn't fall for you, you were behind me. Oh my god! You are really a ghost. No, technically I'm not a ghost. - How dare you? Because I'm not dead yet. Why did you run away from the hospital? You are trouble, I have to run. - Trouble? I am trouble? Mr Raj Jaiswal, this is a bit much. Not you, Dilnaaz. - Relax, Raj. So this is Dilnaaz? What's great about her? She is so ordinary. Have you seen your face? You are worse than ordinary. Really? - No, no... Then why did you invite me for dinner last night? You were supposed to dine with her? Are you nuts? I am better company. Dinner with you? I'm not nuts. That's it! - Oh no! I've had enough. I won't work with this filthy man. Just roll, baby. This is reality TV. I won't keep mum. I will sue you for sexual harassment. Ghost! - I'll take this channel to court. Hey, that's not Ms Creative. Pack up Ghost No, it's not possible. Please go away. - Raj, listen to me Raj Raj, listen to me. - I don't want to hear you. Please go away. Why are you after me? Please leave me. Excuse me. - What did you say? Raj, what's wrong with you? Nothing. What's wrong with me? I'm just a bit tired. I'm not mad. - I didn't say you are mad. But everyone there thinks I am. - All right, let me come in. Don't! Or you'll regret Why? There's a ghost in the lift. - There's a ghost in the lift? Raj! Listen to me. Why didn't you allow him to come in? - I can't hear you, I can't see you. No. I can't see anything. It is not true! - Why are you running away from me? Lord, save me. Raj, listen to me. Listen to me. Will you listen to me, Raj? Come on, Raj! Take her away from me, Lord. I told you... I'm not a ghost. Go away. You don't exist. lt'll be bright sunshine in Stockholm today. It's not happening to me. Where are you going? - Wherever you go. No, no. Please... please come out... come out. Please Calm down... you are in control. Hello? Raj stop talking to yourself. AK, I'm not talking to myself. Wait there, I need to talk to you. No. - I'll come and tell you. Wait! No! Move Why? - You mind if I drive the car? Are we talking? Or going on a drive? - We'll talk while driving. AK, you're entering at your own risk. - Yes, I know. You know nothing. Hello, excuse me... I'm not your driver. Will you come and sit in the front? - I can't sit in the front. I forget. The ghost is sitting in the car. She-ghost! - Of course. If you have a problem, there surely has to be a girl. And right now she is sitting beside you. No AK, she is sitting beside you. Right here? She is hot. You have a great tuning with the ghost. Tell her to go and sit behind, so that you can come forward. Sit please. Please. - What? Of course What? Shall we? - Let's go. Look, there's no need to tell him the truth. He is my best friend, I can't lie to him. Why not, bro? When you can talk to nobody, why can't you lie to me? I'm not talking to nobody, AK. She is sitting behind us. Why don't you tell the ghost to get off and leave us alone for a few minutes? I wish to talk to you. Until then tell her to go to a graveyard and sing. Gone? Gone. - Where? You are a genius. Why didn't you say that before? What's up with you? - What's up with me? AK, please understand. You don't believe me, right? - Well... I do. Last night, after you took a bath, you met a girl. She was with you the whole night. - Not together, but yes... Away. Because she wasn't a girl, she was a ghost. Not the spooky movie types... - Beautiful ghost. Very good. She also says that she is not a ghost and she is alive. She is comatose. - Yes, correct. No one can see her, except you. Very good. At least it will take two years in the mental asylum. AK, cut it out! I'm not mad. I have seen her body with my own eyes. Every mad man says that... - I'm not mad, I am not mad. Exactly You are right. I need to rest. Let me drop you back at the office. You are right, you badly need rest. Go home and take rest, I'll take care of the office. Don't worry about me. See you. - Yes. But don't see anybody else, I'll get jealous. Know what? I met Mrs Khanna before coming here. That gossip-monger Mrs Khanna. She was asking about your health I said, fine. She will come home in some days. I don't know why she laughed at me, as if I was lying. That was it. I walked away in a rage. Oh God! Shivani, don't be upset now. I'm telling you, you'll be absolutely fine. Turn that side. Good girl D'you know what is the greatest strength of human beings? Faith. Everytime I see you, my faith gets stronger. I know, you will come back. You have to, my child! I can feel you too. - Feel what? Oh no, not you, ma'am... - I'll send Bob. And I'll see if you can feel him too. If it goes on like this, I'll be hauled in. Do you believe me now? - Is this possible? Possible? It is happening, Raj You still have doubts? Hi. Can I have a coffee and some scrambled eggs please? Sure, whatever you want. Yes, it's happening. But why? You... in the hospital... in my house ...why in my life? I don't know. I know only my story. But why in my life? Do you have a phone? - Why? You want to make a call? Take out your phone and talk. Thank you. Hello? So tell me your suspense thriller. Just one condition. Use your heart, not your mind, to listen. After the accident when I came to, I found myself in this weird state. Since I'm an doctor, I couldn't believe such things could happen. It scared me, but the sight of my mom would give me hope. I stepped out of the hospital with that hope... And went to see mom. I found that she too was losing hope. I couldn't see her sorrow. For days I just wandered. Among the crowd, alone, troubled. Finally, in search of peace, I decided to go home... your house, now. I was thinking that there's no end to my woes. And last night... I met you. You can see me, I can feel you, listen to you, blah blah blah. All right, I'll help you. Really? Why? - You think... I lent you a ear to pass time? I don't do things if I see no profit And from you, I stand to gain a lot. Come on, follow me. Shivani, there are three girls behind you. I like all of them. Find out if I stand a chance. Are you crazy? What? Go. You don't have a choice. I think he's really cute. Tell me, what were they saying about me? Forget it. - Why forget it? Forget it. - Why? No chance, Raj. - What were they saying about me? That... - What? She said, you came alone to the bar. So? Your clothes... - Clothes? What about my clothes? They're strange. - Strange? You know, they think you are... I am? - Gay. I told you, this bar is a bad one. Let's go. No use being your friend. Go back to wherever you've come from. Why do you look at life like this? - Because in our world, this is how we look at life. Do whatever you have to in your world. Tell me, don't you use this road everyday? Yes. - How many times till now? Why? - Just asking. Might be a 50,000 times. Happy? - What do you like the most here? Are you interviewing me? - Come on, Raj. Many things... - Like? Like... like these apples. Even the queen of England... buys her apples from here. And yes the coffee shop, whose Jamaican brew is very special And Marques Potter, where Akshay and I used to have a drink everyday. Also that restaurant whose food is tasteless but waitresses very pretty What's so funny? - Want to see from my perspective? No. Please Please Okay. - Got a handkerchief? Yes. Why? - Blindfold yourself Not myself, I like to blindfold others. And that too at my home, not here. Don't get excited, Raj. Come on, trust me. Okay. - Trust me. You won't throw me in front of a bus, will you? No Come on Concentrate. Can you hear the tweeting of the bird? It's in a cage. Must be calling out to its beloved who was separated. What do you think? There's a beggar outside your favourite bar. Everyone thinks he is blind. You also give him money. But he's not really blind. He's acting. And your Queen of England's favourite apple-seller, who's quite famous, his apples look more fresh and red. But no one knows that... he uses a spray that makes the apples shine more. Don't buy from him again. And this is Michelle, the florist with a smile. But she's hurt from inside, Because her son has gone for war in Afghanistan. It's been years, and he has not returned yet. Michelle's world has stopped on that turn. And this place is called The Lamp Of Love. You must've heard about it. Lovers who kiss under this lamp post stay together forever, they say. But why'd you care? Do you see something here too, that I can't? Am I missing something? Your Phone. Take out your phone and talk - Why? People will call you mad. - But I'm not mad, right? Let people call what they want, I don't care. - Really? "Whatever people wish to say," "let them say" "Whatever happens," "let it happen" "Why should the world bother if a heart..." "meet another here?" "Whoever wants to say anything," "let them say" "Just don't bother" "No, no..." "don't be afraid of the world anymore," "don't hide anything" "Whatever it is, it is the truth, don't you hide from the world" "Please come, for a moment..." "please sit" "The feelings in your heart, pour them out" "Why should we be afraid?" "If anyone thinks we are crazy, O ignorant one?" "Whatever we want to do," "let's do" "Let the others freak out" "Whatever they wish to say, let the people..." "say" "They will say it and forget," "just think" "So why should I change for them?" "He who doesn't understand changes" "Whoever cares for the world," "let him care" "Let him change" Did we do anything wrong last night, Shivani? Why, what happened? - Forget it, Raj. You look innocent while sleeping. - I'm extremely sorry to disappoint you. But now that I'm up, I've got lots to do. I have to put your spirit back into your body. And I really don't appreciate you watching me while sleeping. Coffee, sweetheart. - No. Raj, it's not your cup of tea. It's a waste of time. Really? Do you have a better idea? You entered my house, got me into this mess... and now you say it's a waste of time. Women! What do you want me to do? Excuse me. Trust me, have the coffee, take a bath and feel fresh. I am the ghost, not you. I've told you before! You are not a ghost, you are she-ghost. Okay, I'm just kidding. Actually you are... I am? Forget it I am? - Forget it. I am? - Jesus! Shivani, stop being spooky... and spare me. You are beautiful, very beautiful. Why did you keep doing this? Have you ever been in love? I do, everyday. - Grow up, Raj. Not that kind of love, I'm talking about true love. Even I'm talking about true love. Is my love a farce? Even I love truly. If you think true love is marriage, then I'm really not interested. Have you seen Akshay? He gets beaten up everyday. His wife used to run after him, now he's running away from her. Women! Women! Women. Raj where the? - AK, what's up, dude? You got a long life. We were just talking about you. Really? Forget it. When will you get time off from your ghostly encounters? I've been waiting since morning. Can't you even give me a call? Pardon? Was I meant to call you? - I see. When I was committing the most beautiful mistake of my life, you were busy taking our photographs... And now when I rue those days, can't you even give me a condolence call? It's your anniversary. I forgot, I'm so sorry I'm also sorry Congratulations buddy. - Mere wishes are not enough I've organised a party at 8 tonight. You know how dangerous Kuljeet is. Of course. - Be on time. And bring along... the ghost. I would love you come. - She says she'd love to come. You are most welcome. - Not up, she's next to you. Do come at eight. I'll see both of you at eight. I think you should leave. - Is she a vegetarian or non-veg? She can't eat. - I see. She might like to drink? Drinks blood. - Dracula's sister? Any preference? B positive. - Don't worry, I'll organise it. Raj, my boy! Come in. - AK, what's up? Congratulations. Congratulations for what? For her? - Kuljeet, Happy anniversary. Thank you, Raj. Are you all right? Pardon? I'm absolutely fine. Raj, did you get Ms Invisible along? Yes, she's with me. How are you, lady? Is everything fine in ghost world? She's standing here Both of you come inside. Raj Jaiswal of British Raj? Not a bad show. Who's that? - Our family psychiatrist, Dr Patnaik. We are happy because of him. - So you guys think I need a shrink? No, no. No problem in meeting him. - Come on. Have a drink. - You will get advice for free. C'mon It's okay, Raj, I had also seen a ghost once. In mirror. - No. On the wedding altar. Doctor, please have some hot samosa. Kuljeet made them. Have some. No? Raj, you try one. No, no, I'm full. Aishwarya Rai, wherever you are, have a samosa. My wife made them. Nothing will happen to you. It's dangerous only for living being. - Then you can eat after I kill you! Still I can't digest them. - Today's our wedding anniversary! No wonder I was beaten up twice. - I beat you yesterday, not today. We don't need samosas. - Okay. So Raj, where is this ghostly girlfriend of yours? Right now Shivani's standing near the window. I got it. Your parents are divorced, right? Yes. How do you know? How do you know? - The way he swings his legs. It's a sign. I can tell. Such a shame! A handsome guy... You are a virgin, Raj. What? - You are a virgin, Raj? No, no! How do you know? His girlfriend is a ghost. Now what do you expect? What is this nonsense? And what is the point of all of this? The point is, you need help. And only I can help you out. Exactly. - Yeah, right. Now tell me, how does she look? Not like an ogre, she looks simple and beautiful. Raj, you need help. You know what you have to do? You gonna let go you, let it slide. let go Raj, let it go, Raj. - Yes, let it go. Smart baby, let it go. See how they let go? See how happy they are now. What do you say? I let her go, but she doesn't go. - Don't shake your leg! Stop all that. Let it go. - Let's go where? Shopping. - She is incorrigible. Doctor, please let go of my wife. Shut up, guys. Okay? I am not imagining anything. He's okay, he's fine. He is not imagining anything. That's it. You let it go, that's why no more shaking of leg. You let it go. Raj, you are cured. Congratulations. - You let it go! Know what, guys? You are right. - Yes, of course. Shivani, let's go. Say bye, Shivani. - Thank you for dinner. Doctor... He needs help. He needs help. Bring him to my clinic tomorrow. Can you get me samosa? Yes, yes... Dr Shah, Inspector Smith is here to see you. Salaam Namaste Thank you for seeing me, doctor. You must be very busy. What if we shift Shivani to some other hospital? She might get well soon. You want to say that we are not taking care of her? Don't forget that it is our hospital that saved her life. Else, who survives such a serious accident? It was serious, but was that an accident? I have my doubts. Hello I didn't see you the whole day and was happy. Planning to jump? But what's the use? Nothing would happen to you. You're okay? Where? Hey Shivani, don't do that. What's wrong with her? What are you staring at? You can even cry? - Yes. What's up? Tell me. - I had been to hospital, Raj. Dr Shah has decided to take off my feeding tube. So? - I'll die, Raj. Really? You mean completely dead? Or will you die and stay here? I'm just kidding. You know my sense of humour. But why is he doing that? - He doesn't want me to live. But he's your doctor. Shivani, I don't understand. - I know, you don't. Because you are not aware. - Of what? I didn't tell you the entire story. I did not meet with an accident. They tried to kill me. Why? Six months ago, the hospital suddenly paged. One of my patients was serious When I reached the hospital, Dr Shah was already operating on him. When I reached the operation theatre, I saw him take his kidney out. I was scared. Because the patient's kidney was perfect, he was a heart patient. I realised that I saw something I was not supposed to. After four hours of surgery, the doctors and colleagues of my hospital saved my life. I survived, but not all of them were happy about it. I heard them in the hospital today. Dr Shah will kill me, Raj He will kill me. He told Mom to sign the documents. If I don't come around in 36 hours, he will also stop my respirator. Doctor Shah told her that I'll never return. Never. Who knows? Maybe he is right. Everyone has to go. Maybe it's time for me. Dr Shah is right, I won't come back. Come on Shivani, don't think like that Let the doctor do whatever he wants. Nothing will happen to you. If you were to die, you won't have come to my house. All this wouldn't have happened. I guess, there's no other way out. Finally, I have to help you. I stand to gain. If you reenter your body, at least you'll get off my back. It's a joke, darling, you can smile. That's no problem? You'll tell me some things only you and your mother know. I'll tell her about it, then she'll believe that you are sitting before me. After that I'll tell her that you have refused to sign the paper. That's it. What do you think? - Not bad.

Wow! Lt'd make a very interesting story. Please mom. - Have you ever thought about me? I watch my daughter everyday and I don't understand... if I should be happy that she's alive, or mourn her death. You think I'm happy to sign the papers? I just want to free her of this condition. But why'd you care? Go and say whatever you have to. I know whatever I am doing is right, and my God knows. And I have nothing to do with anyone. And now, you get out of the house. Get out, I say.

You don't need to be afraid of anyone anymore. Raj... shall I leave? Thanks for everything, AK. Thanks man. Bye Raj. - See you. Bye Shivani I have to say something. Yes? Is it not possible that she came to... and left on her own? Inspector, if she comes around, she'll be very weak, she cannot just walk suddenly - But why will someone kidnap her? Stop it. Why? - You cannot help me change? Having problems? You can see everything, can't I? Okay, change yourself. "You gave me love, you breathed life into me" "After I found you, I've found all happiness" "Ever since my heart..." "found shelter in your eyes," "I felt as if..." "I really live," "I really exist" "I was a dream," "I've become real for you" "No more grouse I hold..." "against destiny," "now that I've known you from so close" "Now that I have you," "I've found a world of joy" "In your eyes I have seen myself..." "in this world" "I really live," "I really exist" "I was a dream," "I've become real for you" You know, Akshay... relax. Let go... let it go, let it side... go, go. You know what? Just relax. You've been relaxing for six months. And it's not helping me at all, Pat. I get beaten up by my wife everyday and to make matters worse, she is more intelligent than me. And Raj and his ghost are making me mad. Beautiful ghost? Akshay Kapoor! I've seen you before. What a pleasant surprise! My friend, my sweetheart, And this must be Dr Patnaik. Heart specialist. I am John Smith. You are a policeman. Very good. I am Inspector John Smith and we need to talk. It's about a night. As you can see, I'm with my patient. And I have plenty of patience. But why'd anyone steal my ambulance? If they did, there's no harm done. I don't understand how they stole it without the alarm going off. Doctor, who else knows about alarm? Nobody. Nobody except me. Nobody knows about this alarm, except me. And of course Akshay. What happened? AK, what the hell! Beaten up so badly. When will your wife come to her senses? Soon the cops are going to ask you when you will come to your senses. I told you, the ghost and corpse will get us trapped. Police? What are saying? - That Inspector John Smith, who keeps on raving Hindi, he is investigating the case of Shivani. He took me to the police station... look. Come on in, we'll talk. - No, not here. I'll talk to you alone. Just you and me. Okay? AK, at least talk now. Tell me, what did the cops do to you? Don't ask me, Raj. In my place, what'd you have done? Look at you, Raj. Look around, we're in London. So many beautiful girls around, but that half-dead girl is! Let it go. What did the cops do to you? Damn the cops! Tell me, what is happening to you? What's wrong with you? We are both in serious trouble. At least use your brains sometimes. - Everything doesn't need brains. Some need the heart. You falling in love. I knew it! - Are you mad? What you talking about? You know that... - Look, you can fool the world. But you can't fool me, Raj. Not me. You can't fool me. You know, I'm just helping her. Then do so on your own. I don't want to be a part of this madness anymore. You are on your own today. You will kill yourself and kill me too. Hello? - Hello. Am I talking to Mrs Dutt? I'm Inspector John Smith of the metropolitan police here in London. I need to talk to you. - Yes Inspector. I'm just wondering, did you receive the photos I sent you? Yes, I did. - Did you by any chance... recognise the man in those photos? - Yes. It's him. He had come over. Behaved strangely. He works for an Indian channel. He told me not to sign the hospital papers. Papers? What papers? Okay guys, five minutes to go. Where is Raj? Deepak, don't you trust me? Trust me, I can do it I know, you can do it, baby! I mean, all of us... how long can we wait? I can't wait anymore, baby. Put a leash on your bubby, baby! Hello and welcome to British Raj minus Raj. Just kidding. My oversmart... I mean, very smart co-host Raj is not here with us. But that's because he is late. I guess it's fate, he had a much more important date. Oh well, moving on with the show... Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry. Please... He is no more. I'm sorry. Well, that's all from me Dilnaaz. I hope that you didn't miss Raj. I mean, you must've missed him badly. Don't forget to email me.

Very well done. Hi. What's up, bro? Where you been? Thank God Dilnaaz was here... she took care of everything. Or, today we were in big trouble. I'm really sorry... - Yes.

It's our second anniversary of British Raj tonight. Where are you? Yes, Of course. - Please be on time. Yes. - C'mon, get yourself together. Wait baby, I'll give you a ride. You are so sweet. Raj, you are not ready yet. Come on, get ready. We have to go. - Where? To the anniversary party of British Raj. Dilnaaz is not at fault. You reached late. In her place, you'd have done the same. Now come on, get ready. You've got a date tonight. Pardon? Good you came to the party. Did you get the ghost along? No, she brought me along. - Oh shit She is holding your hand and standing. Guys, get closer. - Dilnaaz! Hey, watch out. Hey Raj, get over here. Let's get some pictures together. Hi Dilnaaz... today... you know, you are doing a great job on the show. Congratulations.

"everybody, move" "Come, let's hear about youth, about lives" "Tonight, slolwy," "everybody, move" "Just one thing tonight..." "everybody, move" Wow! For the first time someone got me dancing. Great. Thank you. - I need to talk to you. So what are you doing? - I need to search your apartment. Search my apartment? I think you made a mistake, sir. Listen, dear sir, please. Shivani's mother has recognised you. And we've also found the ambulance. - Who? Shivani? Shivani's mother? I don't know what you are talking about. I'll get the warrant in two days. I just thought you will cooperate. All right then, search my house when you have the warrant. Okay? Okay. - Thank you. I will see you Hi Akshay. Now what? Why did you bring him here? - I've told him everything. What? No! - Inspector John Smith will help us. I don't know what you are talking. I really don't know what he is talking about. Sir, I told you before. Go, get a warrant. - Raj, relax... What relax? What is this nonsense? Why are you guys after me? He is trying to help us. - I ask for the last time. Tell me where the body is. - What body? What am I going to do with a body? - Raj, cool it. No, you cool it. I have no idea what he's talking about. Raj, he knows about the body. - Take him away. Hand over the body, Raj. - Hand over what? You want to search my house? Go, get a warrant. Then we'll talk, okay? Where do you think you are going, sir? The body. Thank God, she is alive - Believe me, Inspector. Just imagine. Raj is not a doctor, still he saved a patient's life. How? He didn't act a quack, but by precise treatment. She helped him... I mean that one. Hey ghost, where are you? Why don't you say something? Anyway, no one can hear you. - Shut up. You both deserve to be locked up. Right now I have to take the body to the hospital. They will kill her. What? - Shivani knew about organ trafficking. What do you know about organ trafficking? And who are you watching all the way? - Ghost. I need to get this woman to a hospital. I'm not going to arrest the two of you just at this moment. But don't try to run away. The arms of the law are very long. Please leave What have you done? Do you know the consequence? Why did you do all this? Shivani, I'm talking to you... If you wanted to do this... Stop crying! And tell me, why did you do all this? Because I love you, Raj And I can't see you ruining your life like this. I love you, Raj. When? - When what? When did you fall in love? - At first sight. Why didn't you tell me? - I was afraid. From whom? - Myself. All of us are afraid, Raj... of falling in love... of getting hurt. It is not easy to express one's love openly. I'll never hurt you. I promise. And back to our Top Story, Organ Trafficking. The terminology may not be new to us, but to discover that... it's been happening here in UK has shocked the nation... to then reveal the very health-care professionals, who are supposed to be saving our lives could in fact be endangering them... is an even more disturbing discovery. A police Inspector John Smith, inadvertently uncovered this racket, was keeping vigil over a patient in a coma. The female patient then mysteriously and briefly disappeared... from Thomwell hospital, west London. Inspector John Smith joins me in the studio. Welcome, Inspector Smith Thanks Shivani, see what's on TV. - How did the patient... actually disappear from the hospital? When did her body go? And how and why did she come back? I'm sorry, all about it is privileged information at the moment, but... the good news is that Shivani's lost body has been found and it's safe The organ trafficking going on in our city... is being investigated by our team. At this moment, we are investigating the staff of the hospital, as we believe that certain doctors are responsible for the trafficking. Jesus! - The moment we have any information, we will update everyone and I will show you, the culprits will be apprehended. Shivani, where the hell are you? Oh my God It's okay Hold me, Raj It's okay. - Raj, let me die. Nothing will happen to you. I got you... I got you. Stay with me. Get up slowly... Okay? I got you. I can't walk. It's okay... it's okay, Shivani. - I can't walk. Come on Shivani, get up! Fight it, please. Fight it! - No Raj, I can't fight it. It's a waste. It's so strange Raj. When I was about to die, I was alive in spirit... And today when I wish to live, I'm dying. Don't think like that, Shivani. Nothing will happen to you. You will have to come back. - I have no regrets, Raj. Because I'm not going emptyhanded. I'm taking along all those moments I spent with you. You will live, Raj, like the way you lived with me. Promise me, Raj. - No Promise me - No, Shivani. You will not leave me alone. It's not fair, Shivani Nothing will happen to you. You will come back. Please. You can't go, Shivani... - Raj, you will live. Shivani please... You will come back. You will come back. Shivani, nothing will happen to you. "I really exist" "I was a dream," "I've become real for you" Don't say anything. She is gone, for ever. Why did you do this? Okay, blame it on me. I did all that because it was necessary, it was right. Raj, even you knew that she had to go someday. She was a spirit, she had to go. When you first told me about her, I knew you were telling the truth. And the day you spoke about taking decisions from the heart, I knew you were in love. But I also knew that it'd all come to this. She is gone, she is dead. Accept it, man! No. - Why? Because she has been killed. And I won't spare that doctor. Raj, our plan of press conference is a success. We got him. He fell right into our trap. Get your hands off me! - We caught Dr Shah. Shivani even gave the statement. - Shivani? Yes She is back. She's come out of a coma. Really? Thank you. Go, give her a hug. I'm sorry... do I know you? Don't you remember anything? My story is very strange. If you apply your mind, you will never believe it... But if you listen to your heart, you might believe it... And believe me, right now, your trust in me is very important for me. You take care. You know, there is a way to eat noodles with chopstick. Is it? How? Well, Sir... - Thank you. Chopsticks you know, set them apart, hold them in these two fingers... and throw them away like this! Then use your fingers, lift it up... and put the food straight into your mouth and eat it I'm Raj Jaiswal - I know. British Raj, right? I hate that show. - I know I'm Shivani Dutt. - I know
