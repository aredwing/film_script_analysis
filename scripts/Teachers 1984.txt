It's cold out there, ain't it? All right, come on. Get through those doors. Oh, come on. Move it. Move it. Come on, get off it. Hey! Danny, check this out, man. Piece of cake. - MAN: either one of these schools... - Sit down. ...you can go to... - GRACE: Mr. Rubell! - What happened? - We've got another one. Stab wound. - Who stabbed you? - I don't know. Of course. Call an ambulance. I don't want no ambulance. It's not for you, it's for the insurance company. WOMAN: Send an ambulance to JFK, please. Oh, would you call the nurse, please. - MAN: Mr. Rubell. - Just a moment. I'll be right with you. (PHONE RINGING) Oh, Ms. Hammond, what can I do for you today? - Do you know that kid is bleeding? - Yes, I do. - Well. This is for you, Mr. Rubell. - What's that? It's a notice informing you we'll be holding depositions here. If your teachers can't remember to bring their records with them, we'll come to the records. - We want to start tomorrow. - Fine. Is that student bleeding? - Yes. We're taking care of it. - Good. Good. Oh, Principal Horn, this is Lisa Hammond of Kemel, Keating and Hess, attorneys at law. How do you do? Her firm is handling the Calvin case. - What? - John Calvin. Suing the school. Oh, yes. Well, Ms. Hammond, I think you'll find that we're trying to cooperate fully with you in this matter. Mr. Horn, our client is suing the school because he graduated but he can't read or write. I should think all of us would be cooperating to help clear this up. GRACE: Mr. Rubell? - Mr. Rubell! - Yes. We have at least 10% of our teachers absent again today, and we're having trouble finding subs. Scrape the bottom of the barrel if you have to, Grace, please. - Mr. Rubell, I'm going to need... - Is Jurel in yet? On a Monday? (RINGING) (MAN SIGHING) (RINGING CONTINUES) Hello? Mr. Jurel, Mrs. Wensel from Kennedy. Are we coming in today? Or are we taking another of our famous three-day weekends? No. What time is it? It is 7:45, We are already 10 minutes late, Mr, Jurel, Well? Well, what? Are you going to teach today? Yeah, I'll be in very soon. Oh, why, thank you, Mr, Jurel, It's so nice of you to take into consideration the trouble you cause other people by your..., I thought you said you were an airline pilot? I am. Didn't I just hear that lady say something about teaching? Yeah, well, I gotta go teach a class on cabin pressure. Oh. You know, oxygen masks. Things like that. Do you want some coffee? - Sure. You want some help? - No. No. Coffee's brown, right? How do you like it? Black or burned? Look, I'm really running late here. Maybe I'd better skip the coffee. Yeah, that'd be my move. Yeah. - Call me sometime. - Yeah. Sure. (GROANS) LISA: Mr. Rubell, I have a list of the teachers - that I would like to meet with tomorrow. - Must have the time down. - It's important that we start... - Lee, would you do this for me, pal, please. None of you seems to take this lawsuit very seriously. And you, Ms. Hammond, take things too seriously. That was your problem when you were a student here. - And it's your problem now. - And you were a rotten English teacher. I know. Do you know that kid's bleeding? You should report that. - Well? - Well, not to me. I'm here to give a lecture. How thrilling. Auditorium across the hall. You are always hogging that machine. Of course. Every day. Day in and day out you are on that machine. I have been trying to use that machine for three weeks, and every time I try, you're here. Well, today is my day. I want to use that machine. I need that machine. That machine needs me. - I fail to see any reason for your... - Oh, you fail to see? You fail to see? Can you see this? You son of a bitch! (PEOPLE EX CLAIMING) - Oh, my God. - Today is my day! My day! - Ms. Bloom, in control. - My day. - You control yourself. This is a school. - My day. My day. Grace, hold up. - Ms. Bloom! Ms. Bloom! - My day! My day! Please control yourself. This is a school. Ms. Bloom! - Ms. Bloom, please, control yourself. - WOMAN: Put her on the floor. Ms. Bloom, stop it. - Nurse! - Come on, now. Nurse, help, help. (ALL CLAMORING) Ms. Bloom, calm down. Who is that? School psychologist. Must apologize for the heat. This hallway is the warmest part of the whole building. Most of the tenants just leave their doors open, so you can get the heat. We're a real friendly building here, you know. Are you sure he's safe? I mean, he isn't dangerous or anything, is he? No. I assure you, there will be no problems with Mr. Gower. He's completely harmless. He merely has a few problems with reality, that's all. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Oh, this place would be just marvelous for Herbert. It's only four blocks from the hospital. Yeah, well, the apartment's upstairs. (MAN SINGING) (SHOWER RUNNING) - Yes? - (SIGHS) Hello, Mr. Stuart Van Ark? Yes. Mr. Van Ark, this is Mrs. Wensel from Kennedy High. We want you to come in and substitute one of our history classes, It may be for several days, Can you make it? Yes. She poured ink, ink, all over Ditto. Oh, God, I'd have given anything to have been there to see that. Can you just imagine his face? (GIGGLES) I tell you, Alex, it's never dull around here on Mondays. - Oh, you ought to... - Excuse me? Could you tell me where I might find room 127? Yup. Just go back, go down the steps, turn right and it's right around the corner. - Thank you very much. - Yeah. (BELL RINGING) Well, back to the trenches. My God, it's a stampede. Where are you going? I thought you didn't like school! MAN: Move it! Now! (STUDENTS CHATTERING) Hey, Timmy, if you're not running for President, sit down. All right, will you? All right. If you're not here, speak up. (ALL LAUGHING) All right, boys and girls! Ladies and gentlemen. Today we're gonna delve into the fascinating world of radiator repair. Oh, we're supposed to be learning about social studies, not radiators. Learning is limitless, Tim. (BELL RINGING) Hold it down, please. Hold it down. Paller? - Paller? - Here! Look, just raise your hand. That's all I need. Please, can you keep it down? Please! Frame? Please. Not those pants. Not again. All right. Hold it down. Please, please. Hold it down. Henson? Henson? How are you, Henson? - Pretty good. - Good to see you. - Alvado? - Alvedo! What? Yesterday you said it was Alvado. No, I didn't, Mr. Rosenberg. Yes, you did. And the day before it was Alverus. No, I didn't! You're trying to get me into trouble, man. (ALL LAUGHING) What's so funny? I don't find anything funny. Aren't you going to take attendance? Attendance? Oh, yes. Sarah, I asked for a wrench, not a screwdriver. Oh, I don't know. - Which is it? - It's by your right hand. Your other right hand. (ALL LAUGHING) Thank you. (SNORING) No calculators, Ms. Mason. A "B" becomes a "C," remember, with a calculator. What is this, summer camp? Please, please. Everybody has their own paper. Come on, Danny, you forgot to carry over... (SCREAMING) All right, everybody. Stay put. Please! Please let me go! Somebody, please! Somebody! (STUDENTS CLAMORING) Alex! Alex! Get him off me! Get him off me! Get him off me! Get him off me! He's crazy. He's crazy! Dues are not being paid here, people. Let's try and bring those delinquent ones up to date, or we're gonna have to take action. A union cannot be run on just good intentions alone. We need cold hard cash. I want you to know that as your union rep, I'm on top of this. They want us here at 7:35. We're gonna hold firm until we get 7:38. Now, these are our three minutes and we will get it. And if we were a private school then we wouldn't have to depend on a bond issue for our salary. How do you spell tardiness? L-a-t-e. MALLOY: Now, about this court-case thing. Well, all I know is that now they're gonna take depositions here. So, we have to change our strategy on that point. What strategy? Remember, whatever they don't find out can't hurt us. - Did anybody really vote for this guy? - I know. Alex, please, I wanna hear this. I don't care what anybody else says about this, we're gonna stick together with the union. I get the feeling I interrupted something. Just Malloy, addressing the Reichstag. Oh, say, Alex. Remember this student you once had about 10 or 12 years ago? - Her name is Lisa Hammond. - Lisa Hammond? Oh, yeah. Bright kid. Great ass. Yes. Well, nothing's changed. Really? She's here? Yeah. But get this, she's working for the law firm that's handling the Calvin case. She's taking depositions here. Starting tomorrow. In fact, she's taking your deposition in two and a half weeks. I knew we should have flunked her. You know what you're gonna say? You're not gonna betray old JFK, are you? Oh, come on, for Christ's sake, Roger. That'd be like shitting on the Peace Corps. You haven't lived till you see them try to serve me with a subpoena. - Oh, here. - What's this? Well, I tell you, Alex. You heard about Ditto and Theresa Bloom, right? - Yeah, which version? - Yeah. With our psychologist on temporary leave and no money to replace her, I gotta have somebody to take over the counseling chores. Me? Why me? - Because you're sensitive. - Oh, that's bullshit. - You're compassionate. - Bullshit, Roger. - You're caring. - Bullshit. You've got a free period. Well, so does everybody else in here. And the teachers in the next period are gonna have a free period too, for Christ's sake. And they'll be drafted too. Alex, we have a lot of misunderstood youth in this place. Now, everybody's got to pitch in. Starting with you. - How many kids is this? - One. - One? - Name's Eddie Pilikian. He and his parents are gonna be at the counseling office in about 10 minutes. - All right. - Now, I know you'll do well. - One kid? - Yeah. WOMAN: All right. Sit. Right there. Right there. Oh, Mr. Rubell! Superintendent Burke is in the conference room with Principal Horn. Great. I mean, just what the hell are you guys running here, a goddamn zoo? I'm in the middle of a fund-raising breakfast and I'm informed that your school psychologist has flipped out in the middle of your goddamn office. And then I get here and I find out there has been a stabbing. And if that's not enough, one of your kids tries to eat one of your goddamn teachers. Mr. Rubell, what the hell do you call that? Monday. Look, Dr. Burke, whatever happens here, I'm taking care of it. Are you also taking care of the lawsuit here, too? You do know we're being sued, don't you? - Yes, I do. - Oh, you do? Good for you! - Dr. Burke, I don't think you really... - I know. I know. I... I understand your problem, all right? But you sure as hell better understand mine! I am fighting for our survival out there. We cannot let the things that happened here today circulate around the city. We have got to control the publicity. Or else this community is gonna lose faith in us and we won't get the new bond issue passed and that means no money. No money means no school. Do I make myself clear? Absolutely. All right, I've asked Alan Lewis, our attorney, to be here to help us on this matter. First of all, I wanna know who is on our team, and I wanna know who is going to rock the boat. And most importantly, we all have to agree on what's to be said at these depositions. Well, very well. What would you like me to do? Well, I have taken the liberty of having your secretary pull the file of the remaining teachers involved. I would like to go over them. All right. The first one is Kenneth Stiles. No. Stiles has no problem. School line all the way. Then of course there's Principal Horn and myself. Yes, of course. What's that one? Alex Jurel, social studies. Yeah, Alex. I don't see any problem there. Oh, really? "1969, started free school. "Strong advocate of students' rights. "Reading program canceled in 1974 due to lack of funds. "Excellent leadership qualities." This sounds like trouble to me. No. No, that was over 10 years ago. Alex and I did all those things when we started. Now look at me. No, Alex is all right now. Why, hell, if they hold a deposition on a Monday, he might not even show up. (CHUCKLES) Mr. and Mrs. Pilikian. Alex Jurel. No, I'm Jeffrey Propes, Mrs. Pilikian's attorney. Oh, really? Oh, what did he do this time? No, I'm here in regards to Mrs. Pilikian's recent divorce. Oh, okay. I see. Eddie, would you wait outside. Mr. Jurel, Mrs. Pilikian has just been through a very trying... Excuse me, one minute. Well, as you can see here in regards to custody, Mrs. Pilikian enjoys full rights... Mr. Pilikian will of course be allowed to see Eddie under certain conditions and with Mrs. Pilikian's approval. Excuse me, one minute. Why are you telling me this? Because we want to make it clear that Eddie's father is not to see him during school hours nor is he to attempt to pick Eddie up from school. Mrs. Pilikian, I'm sorry you have problems, but we're here to talk about Eddie. He's been kicked out of his third class. He reads at a sixth-grade level and he's majoring in detention. Now, don't you think that's just a little bit more important? It's very important to Mrs. Pilikian that we first settle this custody problem. Now, she hasn't been able to function in full capacity since the divorce. I think we've said our piece. Mrs. Pilikian, don't you care about your son's education? Isn't that your job, Mr. Jurel? (DOOR CLOSING) Eddie. Come on in here. Eddie, in. Sit down. - Read that. - Do what? Just open it up anyplace and just start reading. (INAUDIBLE) Out loud. - I don't like this magazine. - What kind of magazine do you like? Come on, just lay off. I don't need this. What you need, Eddie, is another remedial reading class again. You're not fooling anybody. Hey, I passed that class. You can't make me take it again. I read fine. So don't you worry about it, okay? Just lay off. All right. But you just got kicked out of your social studies class. So, I'll give you a choice, you can take my class or you can take study hall. I'll take a study hall. Yeah, my class. Third period. I'll see you there tomorrow. That's all. ALEX: Now, don't blow on me. (ALEX EX CLAIMS) ROGER: I can make it. I can make it. No, I can't. Are we here? - We're here. - See, I told you I could make it. What do you want? Hey! (LAUGHING) What was that? What was that? What do you want? (LAUGHING) I'll have a Grasshopper. - No, make it a Pink Lady. - All right. And put in it some fruit and Tabasco sauce. And some of those little sesame seeds. Oh and don't forget the umbrella. Hold the umbrella, open it up and put in the drink. (LAUGHING) - Thank you. - You're welcome. (EX CLAIMS) Too much vermouth. Too much vermouth. I sense tension here. What's the matter, Alex? Oh, it's getting to me, Rog. It's supposed to, that's why it costs so much. No, not the booze. The school. The bullshit. The bullshit. Of course, the bullshit. Hey, I know. Let's go be... Let's be cowboys. - Yeah, yeah. Cowboys! - Yeah... - Oh, no, no, no. - What? - I'm afraid of horses. - You pussy. I'm afraid of them too. (LAUGHING) I'm just getting tired of the whole damn thing. Like that Pilikian thing. You knew that lawyer was gonna be with that mother, you knew that. Oh, come on. Is that what's been bothering you? Pilikian? Oh, forget about Pilikian. Pilikian is a lost cause. Oh, yeah. It's getting too easy to forget. There's too many Pilikians in that school. Hey, hey, we do good. Lots of them learn. Lots of those kids learn. They learn good. We are not the bad guys. We do good with what we've got. - What we got sucks. - You know it. (STAMMERING) So, what are you gonna do? Quit. Just quit. Hey, now listen to me. You've been a teacher for 14 years. - Fifteen. - That's what I said. - Oh. - And you're a fucking great teacher. - Was! I was a fucking great teacher. - No, no, no. Listen to me. Without us, there's nothing. Nothing. We're the last stand of civilization. If we fail, anarchy. "Anarchy." - Or worse... - "Worse." - A baby boom. - "A baby boom." What do you think those little monsters would be doing if they weren't in school? I don't know. - Fucking, fucking like fucking little rabbits. - Fucking? We've got to stop them. - You mean, I'm a contraceptive? - Yes, and one of the best. (BOTH LAUGHING) I'm an old fucking rubber. I'm going to bed. You wanna stay over? No, no, no. I can drive. - Fasten your seat belt. - Absolutely. (FOOLIN'AROUND PLAYING) Mr. Jurel! Mr. Jurel, I would like a word with you. Well, make it a quiet one, Gracie. I've had a hard day. School hasn't even started yet. (SIGHS) All right, what do you want? You cannot put Eddie Pilikian, a lower-level student, into your third-period social-studies class, an upper-level class. Sure, I can, Gracie. I've got tenure. It's not school policy and if you would read the curriculum circulars you would know that. But then you never read the curriculum circulars, do you? Mr. Jurel, at least have the decency to fill out the proper paperwork. - Okay. - Thank you. Alex, you seen this yet? Looks great. I've been meaning to get one of those myself, Carl. LISA: Mr. Jurel! Shit! Hi. Lisa Hammond. Okay. Holy shit, lady. God damn it. - Mr. Jurel. - Lisa, are you nuts? This is the boys' bathroom. Yeah, I know. Well, I've always wondered what one looked like. - No big deal. - I'm taking a leak. I wanted to talk to you. Well, call me on the phone, for Christ's sake. This is the boys' bathroom. Oh, come on, Mr. Jurel, I have two brothers, for crying out loud. Well, I don't. Do you mind? - Here, dry your hands. - Thank you. Oh, fuck! Hi. That was cute, real cute. It really is good to see you, Mr. Jurel. Considering how much you've seen, why don't you call me Alex? God, the room seems so different. (SIGHS) I guess nothing's the way you remember it. You're mad, aren't you? You really take your job seriously, don't you? That's what you taught me. - So, what do you think? - About what? - The Calvin case. - I try to stay out of political things. I have a hard enough time just teaching. "Political"? Alex, this case is about teaching. It could mean a great deal to education. I mean, a boy goes all the way through a school system and gets passing grades and a diploma and still can't read or write. This boy was one of your students and he can't even fill out a job application. Don't you think there's something wrong with that? You were one of my students and you can fill out a whole subpoena. You know, I had a terrible crush on you. Who didn't? (CHUCKLES) Listen, I'm really sorry about what I did. Let me make it up to you. Let me buy you dinner. - Dinner? - Yeah. What do you say? Talk about old times and all that. Okay. Where? How about my place, 7:30? - Does your bathroom have a lock? - Two. Good. Okay. Good. See you tonight. Love the shirt. Great ass. (CHEAP SUNGLASSES PLA YING ON STEREO) Hold it. Let me see your pass. - Okay. - Thanks. - You wanted to see me, Mr. Troy? - Yeah, come on in. Present here are Lisa Hammond, counsel for the plaintiff, Alan Lewis, counsel for the defendant and Eugene Horn, principal of John F. Kennedy High School. Have you ever given a deposition before, Mr. Horn? No. Well, it's very simple. I'm just going to ask you some questions and you're under oath, so I'd like for you to answer them as fully as you can. - Okay. - Good. Did you have a student here at JFK named John Calvin? - I don't know. - You don't know? Ms. Hammond, there are 2300 students here at Kennedy every year. I don't know all of them. - Wouldn't your records show enrollment? - Yes. Okay, where are your records? I don't know. Fuck you! (BOYS GRUNTING) Fuck you! GUARD: Move it! Coming through! Move it! Move it! Move it! Look out. What the hell is going on here? No problem. There's no problem. He just slipped, okay? He's fine. - I'm fine. Fine. - He's fine. No problem. (BELL RINGING) - Hey, you okay? All right. - I'm fine. - Come on, let's go. - I'm fine. Fucking Paller. - Fucking Paller. - Oh, excuse me. I didn't do shit to him. (SIGHING) - Eddie, you got to get me a piece. - A piece of what? That's very funny, Eddie. Very funny. Next time I see that asshole I want to have something on my side. No, forget it, okay? You let me handle Paller, all right? Okay. - Thanks, Eddie. Thanks. - Forget it. Forget it, will you? Okay. Thanks. Okay, I'm taking off. You want to come? Sure, yeah. Sure. - MAN: Hey, wait... - Shit! What're we gonna do now? Hey, trust me. Come here. - Come on, will you. - Okay. All right. (WHISTLE BLOWING) Can you believe this shit? If John Calvin was a student here at JFK, would his name appear on these records? Yes, it should. Good. Now, who's in charge of the records? I don't know. (SIGHS) Nice touch. What touch? I really don't know. (ALARM SOUNDING) That's the fire alarm. Move it out, quickly. To the right! To the right! (CAN'TSTOP THE FIREPLAYING) (STUDENTS CLAMORING) Hey! Hey, you two! Come here. I want to talk to you. Hey! You're in big trouble. (STUDENTS WHOOPING) (ALL CHEERING) - Get in. Come on! - No. We can't do this, Eddie. Haven't I taken care of things since third grade? (SIREN WAILING) Have we got balls or what? This is fucking great. Give me five. (SCREAMING) So, that's how I passed the bar exam. So, whatever happened to Mrs. Jurel? I wanted to be a teacher and she wanted something more than my teacher salary could provide. Food, clothing, shelter. (CHUCKLES) So there hasn't been anybody else? No, not really. What about you? Oh, hundreds. I'm a lawyer after all. So, you haven't told me what you think. Oh, the meal was great. No, I'm not talking about the dinner. I know the dinner was great. I got an "A" in home ec. - I'm talking about the case. - What case? Oh, that's how we're gonna play it? I'm serious. I really want to know what you think. Why is it so important what I think about your case? Because the other teachers will follow what you do. You're one of the leaders of that school. Boy, Lisa, you've been gone a long time. Yeah, I guess I have, because JFK is nothing like I remember it. - Maybe you have a selective memory. - Oh, come on. In the two days that I've been there I've seen a stabbing, a teacher attack another teacher, a student bite a teacher, a fire alarm that looked like Hiroshima. It's not a school anymore, it's a loony bin. - Oh, Lord, here comes another subpoena. - What's that supposed to mean? - What? - That crack. What's the matter? You afraid I might do more for education than you? Education? Are you nuts? Lisa, your lawsuit isn't about education. It's about money. Nobody really cares if that kid didn't learn. They just wanna make some major bucks. Oh, great. Just what we need. Words of wisdom from a guy who hides out in bathrooms. (SIGHS) You know, Lisa, there's nothing worse than a female lawyer with a cause. Except a male teacher without one. Is it so hard for you to admit that something's wrong there? Oh, hell, Lisa. Come on! Do you think you're telling me something here? I've been there day in and day out for 15 years. Don't even think you can try. Listen. I counseled a kid named Eddie Pilikian the other day and it was a waste of time. I can't reach this kid. The parents and the system, they've so fucked up this kid that I don't know. I don't think I'm ever gonna be able to reach him. Yes, you will. You'll reach him. You'll make a difference. You did with me. (EXHALES) Look, it's not right for a lawyer to be discussing a case with someone she's gonna be deposing in two weeks, is it? No. But I didn't ask you here as an attorney. Why did you? I think I better check the dessert. What do you mean, what am I gonna say at my deposition? I'm gonna say the same as everyone else. ROGER: Oh, Carl, just forget it. Easy for you to say. You forget it! I'm telling you that Reese kid has gotta go! He's trying to drive me crazy. First he attacks me, now he's trying to drive me nuts. - I want him out! - Will you calm down? Yeah, Alex, I had Eddie Pilikian. The kid had about a sixth-grade reading level. He couldn't do the work. I didn't know what to do with him. How about teaching him to read better? Mr. Van Ark, I am a social studies teacher. It is not my job to teach reading. But you are a teacher. Some people should have more experience before they speak. (TEACHERS CHATTERING) So, what are you gonna say at your deposition, Ray? What is this? An inquisition? - Carl, be reasonable. - "Reasonable"? Now, what do you want me to do with him? - I told you! - I cannot expel him! Why not? Because the courts will not allow us to violate that poor child's rights. What about my rights? And a juvenile hall will just send him right back here. Nobody would want us to let that kid loose on society. Then put him in his class. Oh, it's fine with me. - I'll handle him. - You'd bore him to death. What's that supposed to mean? What do you think it means, Ditto? Your class is boring. Your students don't learn a thing. If it weren't for tenure, you'd be selling vacuum cleaners. Have I left anything out? I don't have to take that from you. I have received three consecutive teaching awards for the most orderly class. Three consecutive teaching awards for the most orderly class. And what do you think about that, mister? Gee, Ditto, your shit don't stink. (I'M THE TEACHER PLAYING) And how was your date last night with Ms. Hammond, Alex? (BELL RINGING) Reese, where the hell is my desk? Reese, where the hell is my desk? Reese! All right. Let's talk about the responsibility a school has to its community. Aren't we going over our homework questions? We'll do that later. Let's talk about this first. Does a school have a responsibility to its community? Babysitter. All right, babysitter. That's right. Yeah. Anything else? You were supposed to be here yesterday. Mrs. Wensel says I ain't even supposed to be in this class. Mrs. Wensel says I ain't even supposed to be in this class. Yo, me neither. No one knows where you're supposed to be at, Terry. (ALL LAUGHING) It's all right. I'll take care of it. Take a seat. So, what other responsibilities does a school have to its community? Where did you leave off? Pickett's Charge. (ALL CHEERING) (ALL APPLAUDING) (ALL LAUGHING) "Four score and seven years ago, "our fathers brought forth on this continent "a new nation, "conceived in liberty "and dedicated to the proposition "that all men are created equal." (SNORING) (CLASS ALL LAUGHING) All right, all right. Forget community. Let's just talk about you. Let's talk about us. You in school, what does school do for you? - Nothing! - Nothing? It gives you a diploma so you can get a job. Then it does something. School is just a place where teachers make money. Yeah, sure. I got a yacht in the Caribbean. All right? Lot of money. - Does school round out your knowledge? - No. Why? They teach you all this junk like who was Hiawatha. I don't care who she was. They never teach you what you want to know, right? Hiawatha was a man, Tim. You see what I mean? Who cares? I think we know what's better for us more than the teachers do, you know. - Right. - Right. Tell them about it, Diane. I think school does a good job. Oh, shit. It makes us better people if we learn this. (RAZZING) Mr. Pilikian, was that just a large breakfast? Or do you disagree with this man? Well? Come on. This place is a joke. What do you mean, it's a joke? You're being sued by some kid 'cause you didn't teach him nothing. What're you gonna say when they ask you about that? All right. Fine. Mr. Pilikian has just given us another assignment. Say what? TIM: Oh, man! No, wait a minute. You tell me. Tell me what's wrong with this school. You tell me what I should say. So, what? We gotta write another paper now? No, you don't gotta write another paper. Just communicate your ideas. I don't care how you do it. You can write a paper if want or take a photograph. Do it any way you want. Sing a song. Communicate. Hold it. How do we know if we do this we're not gonna get in trouble? You don't. But I'll guarantee it. No getting us for what we say? No reprisals. Yeah, no reprisals. All right. (ONE FOOTSACKIN YOUR DOOR PLAYING) All right. One more, one more. All right, you ready? Okay. Great going. Okay. And... (STUDENTS EX CLAIMING) BOY: Boring! Boring. BOY 1: Teacher's lounge. That's the girls' bathroom. (ALL APPLAUDING) BOY: Eddie. Eddie. - All right. - Eddie. - BOYS: (CHANTING) Eddie. - All right. Way to go, Eddie. No reprisals, right? (ALL LAUGHING) DAN: Mrs. Wensel? GRACE: Yes. Dan Hall, Independent Insurance Company. I'm here about the accident involving the driver's ed car. - WOMAN: Sounds good. - Oh. We seem to have misplaced it. What? How can you misplace a one-ton piece of equipment? GRACE: Are you kidding? At this place? What's up? This. (CHUCKLES) - Not too bad. - Not too bad? The kid rips off a camera and takes these pictures and all you can say is, "Not too bad." The morning paper is running these tomorrow. I've been on the phone with Dr. Burke all morning. - Do you want to know how mad she is? - No. He claims you okayed this. Did you? Yes. You can go. Where the hell are your brains? You know how much embarrassment this is gonna cause us? Oh, come on, Roger. It's not like that kid was chewing bubble gum or something. Look, this is the first time I've gotten to this kid. Maybe I can make him give a shit about himself. That's a hell of a lot more important than a silly thing like this! That's not your job! So don't pull some of that Mr. Chips crap with me! Your job is to get them through this school and keep them out of trouble. That's it! Well, maybe I should reexamine my job. Maybe you should! I don't know what's happening to you, Alex. But if you got a personal problem, you work it out at home, not here. This goes on your permanent record. Does that mean I have to stay after school, too? Did you forget to tell me about the paper? Okay, Pilikian. You miss my class one more time I'll let them have your butt. Deal? It's a deal. So, this is your idea of a gourmet dinner, eh? Well, you haven't lived until you taste one of my tacos. One taste and you're gonna agree, I should've taught home ec instead of Mrs. Badie. Move your buns. Wasn't Mrs. Badie... Cut. Wasn't Mrs. Badie having an affair with Ditto? Why, does that turn you on? Compared to what? (EDGE OF A DREAM PLAYING) To this. Sure beats the hell out of Ditto. I had my... My little talk with Ditto today. Guy's still a jerk. Why? Did he fall asleep while you were asking questions? We both fell asleep during his answers. It's really ticking me off. I mean, I just don't understand. I... - Are you listening to me? - No. Cut. I mean, I can understand Horn and Rubell ducking my questions, but I'm trying to help the teachers and all I'm getting is a lot of "I don't knows" and "I can't remember." Wish I knew what the hell was going on. Lisa, are you gonna talk about this all night, because I'm getting turned on. You just don't understand the frustration, Alex. You wanna bet? You don't get out much, do you? Lisa, can't you for one night just forget about the case, the school and everything? For one night? All right. I'm sorry. You're right. We'II... We'll just have a nice dinner and relax and I won't say another word. Great. It's just, I can't understand the teachers. I mean, I'm trying to change an inept system and that can only help them. Lisa, who do you think makes up this system? The people do. And they don't wanna be scapegoats for that system. - I'm not on a witch hunt. - Yes, you are. What is that supposed to mean? Everybody wants to change it. They all have ideas, but nobody wants to pay the price. Now, you're asking some teachers to stick their necks out and they know they're gonna get chopped. You'll end up closing the school, not changing it. You're not gonna tell the truth, are you? It won't change anything. Oh, Lisa, look. I remember a lot from your class, Mr. Jurel. About how you were supposed to fight for what you believed in no matter what it cost. Was that all a lie? Were you just having fun with a bunch of kids? What about Eddie Pilikian? Doesn't he mean anything or was that just self pity? I needed you, Alex. I was counting on you. And what about you, Lisa? I haven't seen you since I don't know when. All of a sudden we're going out and having dinner. Is that part of this fight? - Is that what you think? - What're you getting out of this? Your name in the paper? Just by being here I am jeopardizing my career, but I couldn't stay away. And now I can't even remember why. I don't know how to make you believe me. I don't know if I even really care, but I'll tell you this. I'm gonna ask the questions and you're gonna have to give me the answers. I know what's going on in that school and I'm gonna change it with or without you. What the hell do you know, Lisa? You're not a teacher, you're a lawyer. You can't see what's going on in there. You and those others, you come in the school and you waltz down those hallways and you think you can tell us what's happening there? Well, that's bullshit! You can't see what's happening there because you're hiding behind your memories and your ideals. You use them like shields. When you can drop your shields and walk down those halls naked and really see what's happening then talk to me and I'll believe you. Bye. (INTERSTA TE LOVE AFFAIR PLAYING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Hey! Not bad. Where did you get this car? What do you think? A little paint, a little glue. Where did you get this car? - Where did you get it? - It's Rosenberg's. What, are you fucking crazy? What... What's your problem? You, you stupid asshole, you don't go ripping a teacher's car. What, you want to go back to juvie again? - Get the hell off of me! - No, you can't do this. You're gonna get caught. Now, just take it back. No way. I took this. It's mine. No, no. Take it back. Get rid of it, all right? - Oh, I see. I see. - Get rid of it. Only the great Pilikian can steal a car, anybody else does it, they're stupid. - I'm not stupid! - No, no, Danny, you don't understand. Rosenberg is gonna have the cops all over the place. Just take it back, all right? No! Fuck you! You're so worried about it, you fucking take it back. Fuck you! Oh, shit! (SNORING) (GASPING) (BELL RINGING) (STUDENTS CHATTERING) - Why do we have to read this book? - Because I said to. It's a good book. I just reread it myself last summer. You read in the summer? (BELL RINGING) What is the name of this river? Potomac! ALL: The Delaware! Delaware! The Delaware! (ALL CHEERING) Row! Row! Row! (BELL RINGING) What we're talking about here, literally, is the future of the school. They're gonna try to prove that John Calvin was knowingly promoted when in fact he should've failed. Now as two of his teachers you're going to be asked questions pertaining to that. Mr. Rosenberg, your deposition is tomorrow. Mr. Jurel, yours is in four days. Carl, give it a rest, will you? LEWIS: Now, I feel confident that we have effectively stalled their access to the school records. However, it would be most beneficial if neither of you had any personal records. Don't you wanna know if it's true? Beg your pardon? I said, "Don't you wanna know if it's true?" Isn't that the best place to start? Not necessarily. Alex, just stick to the discussion, please. - Well, I am. - No, no, no. I don't think the question here is whether or not we're guilty. No. Innocence is irrelevant. Oh, you mean we're guilty? Let's not say that, okay? Even if you're kidding. Let's just agree not to say that. Oh, I see. I see. Guilt isn't irrelevant. I asked you not to say that. Look, Mr. Jurel, all we're trying to do here is to help you better prepare your answers. We're not conducting some great search for the truth. Oh. Yes, now, let's stick to the discussion. Carl, quit pacing, will you? I'll pace if I want to, damn it! God! This place is unbelievable. - I want my car back! - What is he talking about? Now, calm down. Just calm down, Carl. Calm down? Calm down? That's what you said when I got bit. That's what you said when they stole my desk. I got a big flash for you, Roger. It didn't work then and it won't work now. Calm, Carl. And you people are beautiful. All of you just sitting here, telling us how to lie. - Don't say that! - Come on, come on! That's what all of you people are doing, aren't you? - Telling us how to lie! - Mr. Rubell. I will not tolerate this breakdown of teamwork. Teamwork? Teamwork, my ass! I'll tell you what you can do with your teamwork! - Carl... Carl. - Mr. Rubell... - I got a lot to say. A lot to say! - Don't say that! You will sit down and you will do what you are told and that is all there is to it. I will not sit down! I'm not a child! You can't talk... I'm not in kindergarten! - Mr. Rubell! - What? I'm sorry, Grace, what is it? There is something wrong with Mr. Stiles. Who? (SIREN WAILING) Ditto. (ALL CLAMORING) Move out now! Let's go! Move out! Let them through! - MAN: Come on, let's go. - Let them through. Come on! Move, move, move! - What the hell is this place? - He's inside. GRACE: Down this way. Let him through, now. Let him through, let him through. - This guy's dead. - Really? How can you tell? (ALL CLAMORING) Hi, Eddie. Hey, Diane, what's up? I need some help. Do your parents know? You can't tell them, Mr. Jurel, please. Eddie told me I could trust you, you know. Look, Diane... - They should be told. - No, Mr. Jurel. My God, they'd kill me. My father would throw me out. My whole life would be over. Please. Which teacher is the father? No, never mind. I don't wanna know that. (SIGHS) What do you want to do? Get an abortion. Well, there are other options. You could... You could have the baby and put it up for adoption. Will you take me, Mr. Jurel? I can't. Please. I'll take you. I'll take you. (CARS HONKING) Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Listen, can I bum a cigarette? - Diane, look, I don't think... - Mr. Jurel, I just had an abortion. I think I'm old enough to smoke. Yeah. Thanks. Diane, you gotta try to forget about it. You know what really gets to me? What really gets to me is that it just doesn't bother me, you know? It doesn't bother me. Why? So? You gotta be kidding me. You know how many people have been looking for this car? You took it? Hey, I never said that. I'm just showing you something. - Why? - Well, I figure this makes us even now. What? Well, you did something for me, I'm doing something for you. We're even. That's important to you? I don't owe people nothin'. Hey, Eddie, how about keeping the car and taking the reading class? Hey, we're even, man. Oh, come on, Eddie, knock off the dumb-talk crap. You wanna act stupid in class, that's fine by me, if that's your act. But we both know you're not stupid. So give me a break. You're getting a chance here, Eddie, take it. Sure beats the hell out of stealing cars. Take the class. Who you doing this for, me or you, all this? Does it matter? All right, I'll take the class. You can keep the car. Well, what the hell am I supposed to do with it? Just drive it up to the principal's office? You're a teacher, man, you'll think of something. Smart. You okay, Carl? Fine, fine, don't worry about me. Okay, Mr. Rosenberg, you just follow my lead today. - I think everything will be... - I know. I know. I know. You've gone over it a million times. I know it by heart. I'll be okay. Don't worry about it. I'll do the right thing. I will. - Okay, good man. - Okay. Let's do it. Was John Calvin a student of yours? Absolutely. Did John Calvin pass the required course in your class? I don't think Mr. Rosenberg could answer that question as put. It's rather vague. Okay, did John Calvin receive a passing grade in your class? Yes. Did he deserve it? I don't think Mr. Rosenberg can answer that question until he fully understands what the question means. Did John Calvin complete the work required to enable him to receive a passing grade in your class? - Once again... - Oh, shut the hell up! Just shut the hell up! John Calvin didn't deserve any grade in my class, because he rarely, if ever, bothered to show up. I had nothing to base my grade on. Then why did you pass him? Because it's policy. I'm sure we can clear this whole thing up. - It's like he's retarded. - Yes, I know. I demand to know why you are flunking my son. What? How can you flunk him when he's already passed the class? Wait a minute, Mrs. Pilikian, now, I'm not flunking your son. The problem here is your getting Eddie to take over the reading class that he's already taken. He's already passed. - Who's Jurel? - I am. He's not supposed to be here. You know that. I told you I can handle this. - He's my son, too. - Wait a minute. - What's going on here? - Are you trying to flunk my boy? Mr. Rubell said that he doesn't have to take the reading class again. Well, wait a minute, if he doesn't have to take the course again, why... You're not supposed to be here. He is not supposed to be here. - He needs that class. - I asked you a question, Jurel. Alex, he's already passed the class. - Look, I've got a... - Will you just shut up. Hey, why don't you all just shut up for a minute, all right? (GASPS) You don't talk to me like that. Fuck off. (SOBBING) - Come on, come on, come on. - He's my kid, Jurel, I'll handle him. You're doing a hell of a job, pal. If you screw around with my kid again, I'll be back. That's not gonna solve anything. Now, please. Let go. Mr. Pilikian, please. Please. What are we gonna do? You heard him. Drop it. - He can't read. - He can read enough. Enough? What the hell's that supposed to mean? God damn it, Alex, what the hell do you want me to do? I am not wasting what little time and money I've got on one kid. For every Eddie Pilikian, there are 50, 100 kids who learn here and learn well. Now, we're not here to worry about one kid. We're here to get as many of these kids through the system with what we've got. Now, that's reality, and you know it. - You can't see it, Roger, can you? - See what? This is the same thing we're being sued about. Don't talk to me about being sued, Alex. I don't wanna hear that. This is the reason Lisa Hammond's down the hall taking depositions. - We're not teaching these kids. - I can't hear you, Alex. - We're not teaching these kids. - I can't hear you. - We're doing it again! - I can't hear you! (PEOPLE CHATTERING) WOMAN: One second. WOMAN 1: Violators... MAN: All these names, numbers don't match up. They're not even close. MAN 1: But I wasn't the only one there. Superintendent Burke, please. Anything wrong? Rosenberg fucked us. What? He told everything. How could you let that happen? There wasn't anything I could do about it, Roger. Oh, God damn it! You can't even control Rosenberg? You know, this puts it in your boy's lap. If Jurel confirms this in his deposition, we're sunk. Donna, hold on. Donna, this is Roger. We've gotta dump Jurel. Hey, Mr. Jurel, aren't we gonna do nothin'? How could you be so stupid? Would you tell me how you could be so goddamn stupid? As if we don't have enough problems. We're in the middle of a lawsuit, buddy. - Three girls. - Oh, hey. Three of our own students. Why don't you go to some other school and get their girls pregnant? Do you know what this is gonna do to this school? Do you know how it's gonna look? Teamwork, Troy, does not mean going out and starting your own team. (KNOCK ON DOOR) - What? - GRACE: Mr. Rubell? What? What is this? It's a search warrant for lockers 50 through 400, inclusive. Oh, no, you gotta be kidding me. When? Right now. (SIGHS) Did you know your cop is flunking? (IN THE JUNGLEPLAYING) I'm trying to talk to them, but they won't take it seriously. That's why it's very important that everyone be at that meeting. Oh, my God. - MAN: Something wrong? - What? No, no, no, nothing's wrong. (BELL RINGING) There's cops out there searching lockers again. Get back there. Fuck you! (ALL CHEERING) 330, whose is this? It's his. You wanna explain this? BOY: Busted! Hey, you, get away from the locker. Get away from the locker. Hold it. Hey, you. Gun! Drop the gun. Drop the gun! No! Drop it! (GROANS) So, why did you divide your force? Why? To prevent escape. That the Indians would escape was my greatest fear. Excuse me, is your name Herbert Gower? Yes! Okay. You mean, you're not Stuart Van Ark? Certainly not. You're an outpatient at Riverdale Mental Hospital? At times. Get him out of here. BOY: Oh, no. BOY 2: Hey, you can't take him. (STUDENTS SIGHING) (BELL RINGING) Sit down! Don't you know who I am? Sure, you're General Custer. I am a teacher, and you will treat me as such. Mr. Jurel. Mr. Van Ark. Gower. Mr. Gower. Where you been? Just around. You okay? So, you gonna come back? Not to this place. No way. Then what are you doing here, Eddie? I heard about Danny. Why'd they kill him? He wouldn't have used the gun. Nobody knew that, Eddie. Yeah, well, I did. I knew Danny, man. He was just scared. He was always scared here. He wouldn't have used the gun. He just wanted to make sure nobody got to him, that's all. It's not your fault. No, it is my fault, 'cause I should have been here. He was my friend. I know that. But he's dead. I'm sorry about it. But, Eddie, he's dead, you're not. Now, you still got a chance. You got a chance, the one he didn't have. Now, don't lose it. There's still time. What, time for what? We both have a lot to do. I'm gonna do my part. Do yours. Come back. You gonna stay, or you gonna go? (KNOCKS) You wanted to see me, Mr. Sloan? Yeah, I thought you might want to know that we've reached a settlement with JFK. The school district has agreed to pay the Calvins $150,000 with a non-admission of guilt. Well, what's the matter, Hammond? You look like I just shot your dog. You can't be serious. This isn't just a routine contract negotiation, this is a school. We have the chance to do what's right. You know the only thing that's right is what the client wants. They want to settle, we settle. We're a business. Like anybody else, we make a profit, hopefully more than most. So, we just check the profit and loss column to see what's right? Don't get involved, settle the case, collect our check because we're just a business? Well, what do we tell all those children who have to attend that school and others like them that aren't gonna learn? Sorry kids, maybe next time. We lose if we settle this case, because we're helping to turn out a whole generation of illiterates. We're not talking about business here, damn it. We're talking about the future. We're talking about reality, Hammond, and sometimes it's a pain in the ass. Leave what's right to God and the Supreme Court. That's what they get paid for. Good night, Hammond. No, no, no, wait a minute, now, listen to me, really, really. This kid has beaten up everybody in the neighborhood, and I wanted him bad. (ALL EX CLAIMING) (STUDENTS WHOOPING) All right! (WHOOPING CONTINUES) (BOY WHISTLING) So, Mr. Jurel, what's going on? You getting married or something? (ALL LAUGHING) Ms. Warren, one does not require a special occasion to show a little style, a little class in one's personal appearance. Oh, of course, excuse me. Besides, today's my deposition. Yeah, and she's good-Iooking. (WHOOPS) I don't know the names, but if you do see him, have him go directly to the gym. Okay? Mr. Rubell. - All waiting down in the gym. - All right, good. Grace, would you find Principal Horn and have him join us? Okay, Malloy, you've got your deal. Now, is the union gonna stand in our way? He's all yours. I hate making deals, but I sure as hell don't want anybody around who could hurt us the next time. Yeah. What about the gym teacher? He's cooperating. We're putting him in another school. - Rosenberg? - I'm having him come in today. Mr. Jurel? Mr. Jurel, you're wanted in the gymnasium. What for? I'm sure I don't know. Ah, Mr. Jurel, won't you join us, please? - What's going on? - Please be seated, Mr. Jurel. Mr. Jurel, how happy are you here, at John F. Kennedy? What is this all about? We feel, that is, all of the board members present and myself, that it would be best if you were to tender your resignation. - Why? - Because, Mr. Jurel, nobody here wants to go through the pain of firing you. You can't fire me, I've got tenure. Hey, I just heard they're gonna fire Jurel. What? Where'd you hear that? The office. Old lady Wensel was talking about it. Mr. Jurel, you know a student named Diane Warren? Isn't it true you took Diane Warren, a 16-year-old student, to the free clinic to have an abortion? The abortion was performed without parental consent. - Roger? - I'm waiting for your answer. Roger. Now, come on, Roger. Talk to me. Do you think that this is proper conduct for a teacher? Well, it's a hell of a lot better conduct than the teacher that got her pregnant. And what was his name? You son of a bitch. I just figured what this is all about. You know, this isn't about a 16-year-old girl that got pregnant. Oh, hell no, that's the last thing that this would be about. We're afraid of what old Alex is gonna say at his deposition today. Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna say. Wouldn't you like to hear that, Rog, old buddy? Forget it, Alex. The case has been settled already. There's not gonna be a deposition. It's over. Your resignation, Mr. Jurel. Oh, for Christ's sake, Burke, what do you think, that's gonna stop me? A disgruntled former employee, who was fired, connected with sexual misconduct. Now, who would listen to you? Who's gonna listen to you? Take the deal, Alex. - Take it. - Roger. Sign the paper and then go home. Tomorrow, go out and look for another job. Do it, Alex. Or you'll never work as a teacher for the rest of your life. I promise you that. (SIGHS) Oh, Roger. Well. Larry. Hey, Larry. Come on, Larry. Help me out. Come on, Larry. I mean, is three minutes all we got left to fight for? Larry? You son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. I hope it's worth it. Alex. You were right all along. The case wasn't about education, it was about money. They settled. - It's over. - Your news bulletin's a little late. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm packing. I quit. - You can't. - Oh, yes, I can. Why? Some schoolteacher knocked up a 16-year-old girl, and I took her to get an abortion. Now, if I don't resign, they're gonna nail my ass to the wall. They're bluffing, Alex. They'd never risk the publicity. Didn't you hear what I said before? The school system settled the case. They paid them off. The school was more afraid of publicity than of losing. Fight 'em, Alex. You still can't see it, can you? Nobody cares! I'm out. I'm through fighting. I can't make a difference. Yes, you can! (EDGE OF A DREAM PLAYING) So, you gonna stay, or you gonna go? No! No, damn it! Don't you walk away, Alex! Don't you turn your back on this just because you're scared! So, everybody loses, is that it, Alex? Just because you're the one who's afraid to face reality? You're the one who's afraid to drop your shields, because if you did you know you'd have to take the risk of staying and fighting. You're the one who's afraid to walk naked down the hall. Well, I'm not. You're scared, Alex. There's a whole room full of kids in there, and they care! And there's a hell of a lot more where they come from. They need you, and you need them, but you just pretend it isn't real so you have an excuse to walk away. For Christ's sake, put your clothes on, Lisa. Well, I'm not afraid to face reality. I'm not afraid to walk naked down the hall. - Lisa. Lisa! - Alex, come on. - Come on, Alex. - Lisa! Lisa! Damn it, baby, please get dressed, or I'm gonna call the cops. - Get out of here! Get out of here! - That's it, I'm calling the cops. Central, this is hall D calling. Get the cops up here, right away. (ALARM SOUNDING) (ALL CLAMORING) Lisa, you are crazy. You are absolutely crazy. And you are a teacher. Alex Jurel, the teacher. Don't let them destroy that. Oh, God. Oh, Lisa, jeez. Come on. Are you gonna stay, or you gonna go? Take Lisa out of here, okay? All right, I can handle that. CARL: I just think I was a little hasty, maybe. What do you think? I don't wanna go to another school. I love this school. Alex, look at this. They're making me resign, Alex. What the hell are you... He signed that. They can't make you resign, Carl. - What? - Nobody is resigning. No? (VEHICLE HONKING) Hey, my car! Hey, that's my car. That's my car. What happened to my car? - I'm not gonna resign, Roger. - You're finished. You're out. Oh, hell, Burke, I'm gonna tell you something. I haven't even started. Now, listen, if you try and fire me, I'm gonna be suing you. What's that gonna solve, Alex? I don't know, Roger, but let's try it and find out. The damn school wasn't built for us, Roger. It wasn't built for your unions, your lawyers, and all your other institutions. It was built for the kids. They're not here for us. We're here for them. That's what it's about. Kids. Alex, half of them aren't even coming back after the alarm. But half will. I think they're worth it. Jurel, you're crazy, you know that? What can I say? I'm a teacher. I'm a teacher. (ALL CHEERING) (UNDERSTANDING PLAYING) BOY 1: All right, Jurel! BOY 2: You're the man, Jurel! BOY 3: Don't let them push you around, Mr. Jurel. Forget to tell me about the fire alarm? You're a teacher.
