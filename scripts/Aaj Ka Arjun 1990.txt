Thakur, take a look at the map ol the liquor lactoy. This is the power plant and this is the production division. This is the supply section and that's the administration side. As per your wishes, the linal installment has also come. But l've heard that you still haven't procured the land. Sir, the Thakur knows to honor his commitment. Run! The Thakur is here. Villagers, il you think by hiding in your houses,... you'll be spared, then you are mistaken. You were given ten days time,.... to come to the mansion to sign. Now l give you ten minutes,.... to come out and sign. Or else... - Leave my lather alone. - Move! l won't give my land. l won't sign those papers. No... Take his thumb imprint. Villagers, you must have heard the gun shot. One bullet was lired and one signature obtained. We can similarly take your sign. So come out ol your houses,... and give your thumb imprints. Didn't you hear me? - We are coming. We'll give our impressions. Stand in a queue. - Give your thumb imprints. - Hury up. Come on. Hury up! One man is missing. Thakur, one man is missing. Who is he? Where is Mohan? Where is Mohan? - He's gone out. - Oh really! When he returns, ask him to come to the mansion to sign. Otheise l'll kill him. Who killed him? l want to know who killed him? One ol your brethen was killed in broad day light... and you are all silent. Tomorrow it could be one ol you. - So tell me. - l think we are in lor better days. At least one man is inquiring about it. God knows. Maybe the inspector is in lor a rough time. He's inquiring about his death. lt's indeed shamelul that you all are abetting the crime. - Is there nobody? - l'll tell you. - Who killed him? - Thakur Bhupendra Singh. lnspector, what brings you here? Someone has died in the village. So? This death occurred when you were scaring the villagers lor signs. The deceased's thumb also bore the ink. - And his death,... - Say murder. He didn't die but was killed. - But why have you come here? - Thakur, you can help the law. What do l have to do lor that? Surrender yoursell to the law. - You have prool against me? - There's no need lor that,... il you accept your crime. Do you know whom you are talking to? Yes, you are the richest man in this area. But you are not above the law. lnspector, the sword never cuts its sheath. Because that's where it rests. ll you want to survive, join hands with me. People keep dogs to guard their houses, not lions. You testilied against the Thakur? You also said he'd committed murder! You rebelled against the Thakur. l'll teach you a lesson that none will dare to repeat this mistake. l'll strip you in public. - No! - No! l'll kill you, you rogue! Tell this also to that Inspector,.... that l stripped you in public. - Swine! - No! Lord, is there nobody to save a woman's honor? Today nobody will save you. Nobody will hear your pleas. Oh God! Who is this angel? Who is he who dared to hit my men? This is no angel. l'm back lrom jail. And l've asked the jailer to keep the doors open,... l'll soon be back after committing another murder. l'm standing in your evil den,... and declaring war on you. No matter how strong your maze, you'll die at my hands only. Don't shout, Thakur. All this while you spoke and we heard. Now we'll speak and you'll hear. You lorcibly took the innocent villagers thumb imprints. Today l'll spread your impure blood on that land,... lrom one end ol the village to the other. l swear by the vulgar abuses you've made... l swear by the tears the kids shed due to your atrocities. l swear by the lields that you set alire,... Now only your death will dispel that darkness. l'll give you a chance to use the revolver but not today. Have patience. l too waited lor seven years. l'd have been doomed had you not come in time. l'm highly obliged to you. Bhima, the Inspector has summoned you. Are you Bhima? Did you have a scullle with the Thakur's men? - Yes. - Why? ll you know we had a scullle, you should know the cause too. l want to hear it lrom you. Why did you hit them? Belore killing snakes, you don't make a list ol their sins. l think you have a personal enmity with the Thakur. l want to know the reason. Are you serious? The reason lor my enmity? He is a common enemy. He is my enemy, he is eveyone's enemy. He is enemy ol evey pore ol this village! This village was not what it is today. Nor was l like this. This village was a happy one. Prosperous.. The lields were green. There was joy and revely. Music and songs.. ''My arms are so beautilul'' ''Adorn me with bangles'' ''My arms are so beautilul Adorn them with bangles'' ''Accept me as yours, my love'' ''No matter how beautilul your arms, l won't adorn you'' ''You unnerve me'' ''People will talk about our love'' ''l will win you over'' ''l like it, you like it...'' ''all your love games'' ''Don't cross my path'' ''Why don't you latch on to others?'' ''Don't ever leave me'' ''Don't break my heart'' ''l'm all yours''. ''l'll lay down my lile lor you'' You got it, Minister? Yes, you'll grab the larmers' land. The buyers will put their money and l'll get the permit. Once your lactoy starts, we'll be rich. But to convert agricultural Iand to lactoy purposes,... we have to get over with some legal proceedings. l know all about it. l won't let anyone cultivate this land lor live years. But times have changed, Thakur. Even the poor are aware. They can't harm us. They can't do us any harm. Just as l get you votes against the larmers' wishes,... so too l can grab their land without their permission. - Understand? - l get it. Hereafter we'll give lood to the larmers. My godowns are over llowing with grains. Lakhan, set ablaze the lields. The lields have been reduced to ashes. - Have patience. - We are doomed. The Thakur has come. He'll solve our problem. Greetings, Thakur! - Sir, greetings. - We are doomed! We are ruined, Thakur. What happened was not good. But don't wory, as long as l'm alive,... nobody will starve to death. Our lields got burnt Brothers, the lields are like children,.. which is always alllicted by some or the other ailment. Sometimes there is lamine, or lloods or lire. So l've decided that instead ol larming,... l'll construct a lactoy on this land. l'll put my money on your land. We'll be equal partners. Until the lactoy is ready... you'll get lood. And once the lactoy is ready... you'll get a salay and an equal share in the prolits. So stop larming. You'll realize that once the lactoy is ready... this village will progress by leaps and bounds. And you will lead a happy lile. Long live the Thakur! Thakur, l've got the grains. - Distribute it to the villagers - Okay. Thakur, il not lor you, we'd have died ol starvation. - Yes, sir. - Thank you! Should l take their thumb imprints? Not yet. Let them get used to eating lor lree. Rogues, you don't want to work lor your living. - l was running a high lever. - Rogue, don't back answer me. Sir, don't hit him. He was running a high lever. l'll do his share ol the work. You go home and rest. Brother, give it to me. Are you drunk in the morning itsell? lt is alcohol at night. In the day, it works as medicine. ll by chance Gauri sister spots you here,... she'll beat you black and blue. l came to speak about her. You are close to her. Convince her about me. Once she lalls lor me, l'll relorm your lile. l'll gift this motel to you. What did you say, you drunkard? ls this your lather's motel? l'll make your lile! lt's not right lor you to hit your husband belore marriage. You think l'll mary you! Why are you hitting him? Someday you'll mary someone. Besides you won't get anyone better than him. Look Bhima, l'll mary only you. What have l done to you that you are scaring me? Leave me alone. Letter... lt must be Laxmi's letter. Please read it lor me. l'll read it, but lirst kiss me. - What?! - Kiss? Shut up! Il you are scared to give, l'll give you one. Have some shame! Eveyone is looking at us. - l don't care. - My letter. You are always ready. - What? - Laxmi's written that she'll be coming tomorrow. She's come! Stay behind! She's passed in English. How are you, Laxmi? - l'm line, brother. - Did you clear your exams? - Yes, with a lirst class. That's because l'd chant your name belore evey paper. Had you chanted God's name, you'd have got a second class. Brother, lirst class is better than second class. l know. Come, let's go. - Aunt, Laxmi's back lrom the town. Bhima's sister? Look, the village teacher is coming. Talk to him in English. Welcome, teacher! See, how lluently she speaks English. You deserve the praise, Bhima. - It's you,... - He's talking about me. Come, let's go. Soldier! That's a soldier. Speak to him in English. He's all the while talking in English. I'm fine and how are you? Laxmi silenced you. Now speak. Brothers, now you all can go home. Laxmi also must be tired after the journey and needs rest. Goodbye! lt is so beautilul. - You drew this? - You think l don't know anything. - What? - You are a compulsive liar, but at least spare your sister. You can't do a thing yoursell. Gauri, don't insult me in lront ol Laxmi. l won't spare you. What will you do? - You chit ol a woman. - How dare you. You still light? - Ask her to leave. - Why? Laxmi, don't listen to her. She's vey inauspicious. She's unlucky even lor animals. l'll also tick you oll il you ask me lor any lavors. Brother, you upset her. She can't digest her lood until she picks a light. Worm, this is the last cup ol tea that l'm giving you on credit. This is Gauri's motel, not your lather's. What does he think ol himsell? How dare you drink this tea? Get lost! Hereafter nobody will get any tea. - Shut shop. - l think she's again lought with Bhima. We'll become bankrupt il she makes the inn a scapegoat Sister, light with Bhima once and lor all to your heart's content. And then shut the motel lor a lew days. Why should l give him so much importance? He's a born betrayer and cheat. l've always been telling you this, Gauri. He is a cheat and jerk. How dare you abuse Bhima? l was gaining lavors with you. l'm his to-be wile so l can give him anything. But who are you? Didn't you recognize me? l'm your to-be husband. What did you say, you leech? - Say it again. - Come closer. Hug me once and l'll never again let you go. l'll hug you so well you'll remember it all your lile! Today my dream is lullilled. Laxmi has cleared her B.A. Brother, why are you cying? These are tears ol joy. Bow to our parents. Due to their grace you've achieved the impossible. - What are you doing? - l never saw my parents. You are eveything to me. lt's with your blessings that l've achieved all this. Stupid, you did it by dint ol your hard work. You don't know what you've done lor me. ls there anyone educated like you even in the neighboring villages? You've done me proud. Freshen up. - Yes? - What sort ol clothes are these? These clothes are lor you. - You think l'll wear these? - Yes. - What will people say? - You're a clever girl's brother Wear it. You'll look like a gentleman. But l can't speak a word ol English. l'll teach you English. No, Moti. lt's me Bhima. Don't bite me. Don't insult me in public. Dogs will be dogs. It's better l llee. Don't wory, they are our lriends. They respect me vey much. Go. Look, they are going. Sir, you are lrom the city? This is your lirst visit to the village? How did you lind the village? How can you go like this? Sip this. Why are you in a hury? l'm sure he'll go to the motel. Sir, wait! This is Gauri's Taj Mahal Hotel. Her hotel serves excellent tea. The owner ol Taj drinks here. Gauri hersell is amazing. Badshah, call Gauri. Look, who's come. You drunkard, you'll make my lile. Look, who's come. He's tying to lool me. Get close to him, he'll improve your lile. No, it's you l want. You mean it? And what about that Bhima? Don't talk about him. He's vey unlucky. Besides l don't like tall men. Besides, we make a great pair. We're just right together. - Let's toast. - Later. - Now let's go. - Gentleman, l'm going. Hey you, where are you taking my Gauri? ''Where are you going, Gauri?'' ''My coat is Englishtani'' ''l am Bhima'' ''My hat is lrom London'' ''l donned this guise lor you,...'' ''O motel owner'' ''Come...'' ''Come to the paan shop,..'' ''at 3.30''. ''l'll wait lor you..'' ''at 3.30'' ''Come!'' ''Calm down. l accept my mistake'' ''My love lor you is true. Accept my love'' ''We'll make a line pair'' ''Stop throwing tantrums'' ''Don't break my heart'' ''Or l'll kill mysell'' ''l'll come...'' ''to meet you at 3.30'' ''l'll wait lor you at the paan shop at 3.30'' ''Finally the girl lell lor the boy'' ''Wait, O damsel'' - What are you doing? - Go to work. - But,.. - No ils and buts. Just hear me out. - What is it? - You're back after so long... Let's spend time close. Besides l've to cook and clean also. l'll do all that. - What? You'll do all this? - Yes. Did l educate you to do all these chores? Now enough is enough. Are you going or no? l'm going. - Now what is it? - l lorgot the main thing. What? - Where did she come lrom? - Bhima, teach me also. - l've just washed my hands. - Go take a bath in the river. And go round me thrice still wet. Then l'll think il l want to teach you. l'll ask Laxmi to teach me. You'll need brains lor that. Where will you get it lrom? ll that is so, then how did you learn? - Pick up your bag. - Yes. Hury up and pick up your bags. - Pick it up. - We don't want Thakur's alms. My man's gone to till the land. We'll grow our own grains. Villagers, he tilled his land against the Thakur's wishes. The repercussions are there lor you to see. He'll have to pay lor his deeds. Hit him. Spare my husband. l beg you. Please spare him. l will spare him but after his death. To perlorm his last rites. So the villagers learn a lesson,... not to rebel against the Thakur. Bang his head against the stone. - Brother! - Gauri, you go. - Go away! - l won't leave you and go. Go. After my death, spread my ashes in the land. So that evey corner will speak about the Thakur's atrocities. - Brother, you'll be line. - l plead with you to go. - No! - What a line sister! She won't let her brother die at any cost. Please spare my brother. - No! - l will spare him. ll you ask me to. Mohan, l'm leaving you lor your beautilul sister's sake. Hereafter il you rebel against the Thakur,... then l won't spare you. Let's go. What was all this? The Thakur doesn't want us to till our lands. - Why? - So that he can grab our lands,.. to construct an alcohol lactoy. l'm sory lor my Dad's behaviour l apologise. No..what are you doing? The villagers and l are gratelul lor what you did. God knows what would have happened il not lor you. Nothing would have happened. Actually my lather is at lault. So l told him that times have changed. Our county is independent. Dictatorship is no longer prevalent. But he reluses to understand. He's vey orthodox so l too have decided,... to leave that house rather have incessant lights. You want to leave your house lor our sake? - Don't do this. - Then what should l do? You expect me to put with all these atrocities? Your going away will neither benelit you nor the villagers. With you here we hope that you'll make Thakur see sense. Because there is nobody to talk to him. Please don't leave this village. - For my sake. - Don't say that. ll you don't want me to go, l won't go. The villagers will bless you. Bhima, don't get disheartened. lt is best to get her married. But l must lind someone worthy ol her. l know ol a suitable boy. l'll take you to him. you?! Your god must be vey benevolent. - He'll lullill my wish also. - You have eveything. Well, what is it that you want God to give you? l want you, Laxmi. Did l do something wrong? l hope God doesn't reject my request. God won't lullill your wish. - Why? - He won't grant such a small thing to such a big man. My lather's wealth was the only barrier between us. l've broken that barrier to come to you. Now we are alike. - But,.. - Look, we are both educated. So rather than beating round the bush, l'll tell you,... that l like you. And want to mary you. We accept your proposal. Laxmi is lucky to get married into such a nice household. Don't embarrass us. But we've a condition. l'll accept all your conditions. l can do anything lor her. l want you to mary my daughter. Okay. - But your son is B.A.? - Don't wory about that. He's an M.A. but my daughter is vey naive. That's all right but the boy is B.A. Isn't it, Gauri? Where did she go? Brother, come out. - Come out. - You'll shout. You agreed to mary that mad girl lor my sake. l had no choice. They'd mary their son to you only il l wed their mad daughter. And l can do anything lor your good. What good are you doing me? People will say, l've laults lor which you had to do this. ln lact, l'll be maligned. - Is this what people will say? - Yes. - l acted stupidly. - You are the limit! Poor Gauri loves you so much and you broke her heart. Okay, l'm sory. - Forgive me. - Apologize to her not me. - Come with me. - What is this you are doing? Won't l leel embarrassed to apologize to the shameless girl? You won't get lood or water until you apologize to her. Okay, l'm going. l've realized that a woman is the root cause ol all problems. Not you but that mad girl. l agree that it's not so bad but why'd l get stuck in this mess? And why did you leave me alone? You expected me to stay there? Or you wanted me to celebrate the occasion? Dance at your wedding? lt's me who's dancing to your tunes. - l'm so naive. - Really? - Yes. - You've brains to chose a boy lor your sister. But you become innocent when it comes to me. Now leave. But where can l go? We will always be together. - Will you leave? - A tall man is usually stupid. And l'm no dillerent. l know l made a mistake by accepting that proposal. But you could've drilled some sense in me. Boxed my ears. - Now lorgive him. - Ask him to leave. How can he leave, sisterinIaw? Sister-in-law, you know him vey well. When it comes to me, he lorgets eveything. So l apologize to you on behall ol him. Actually, it's my lault. l should've told you,.... that l've chosen my husband. Who is that lucky boy? How did you think that the Thakur will accept you? We love each other. l know what you've come to say. l appreciate your leelings lor Laxmi. l also appreciate her leelings lor you. lt is her good lortune that you want to mary her. But the Thakur won't accept it. l know. But after marriage when we'll go to seek his blessings,... he'll relent. Mr Ajit, l'm apprehensive. We have no standing compared to you. Don't be apprehensive. Trust me. What are you doing, Sir? ''You are leaving your brother'' ''Your sister is leaving lor her marital home'' ''What norms are these?'' ''Why does a sister have to separate from her brother'' ? ''Without saying a word, she leaves'' ''How will you live without me?'' ''You are the best brother a sister can ask lor'' ''She leaves with tears in her eyes'' - Greetings, Sir! - Greetings! He is Bhola kaka and she's your mistress. - Welcome! - Come. - What is this, Laxmi? - Don't keep me away lrom you. What are you saying? Get up. Your place is in my eyes and in my heart. He's not here either. - Kaka, where's your master? - He left at night itsell. - Did he leave a message? - He never leaves any message. He comes and goes at will. No, this can't happen. He can't do this to me. He will come back. He won't cheat me. Ajit is at lault. He should've told you belore leaving lor city. Or he should've taken you along. He must've thought that il he tells you, you'll get worried. But he didn't realize that otheise too you'd be worried. And shout at him in English when he gets back. And tell him not to Ieave you behind again. You are cying? Don't cy. Control yoursell. Look, l can't see you cying. Don't wory, he must have gone lor work and will soon be back. Come and lreshen up. l'm doomed, Gauri. That Ajit,... Eveything will be line, Bhima. She's eveything to me. Il anything happens to her, l'll,... Nothing will happen to her. Go to the Thakur. l'm sure Ajit will be there. What did you say? Ajit married your sister. The youth ol our lamily do spend nights with young girls. Ajit told me that Laxmi is the daughter-in-law ol this lamily. Your sister and the daughter-in-law ol my lamily! She's not lit to even be our servant. How dare you even think thus. l didn't. We are no match to you. l may be illiterate but not my sister. She is highly educated. Bhima, l'm a vey bad man. And l never make a mistake in understanding what is wrong. l'm well versed with the ways ol such girls. These girls trap naive boys lrom wealthy homes. Anyway, this is nothing new. Forget it. You too lorget it. What must l lorget? That Ajit himsell asked lor Laxmi's hand in marriage? That he married her in eveyone's presence. l don't want to be your relative or want to enhance my status. l'm your servant and will always remain one. Just accept my sister. Hit me to your heart's content. But give my sister her due. You want me to accept each girl my son spends his night with. Don't talk so cheap about my sister. Your sister conned my naive son lor my wealth. - Don't abuse my sister. - Shut up! She's cheap and immoral. - l'll kill you. - Anybody there? You dared to abuse my sister. l won't spare you. Swine! Swine, you dared to hit me! You abused my sister. Take him to the police and tell the inspector he came to my house to steal. You abused my sister. l won't spare you! lnspector, this is my lile's savings. Take this and release my Bhima. - l beg you. - He went to the Thakur's house to steal. My Bhima is incapable ol such an act. lnspector, release Bhima. He's a vey nice man. He's not capable ol such an act. Okay, il you insist. But il he's seen again around the Thakur's house then he's had it. Constable, release him. lnspector, here after he'll not commit any mistake. l've got such a great news and you are in mourning. Ajit has written a letter lor Laxmi. Ajit's letter. Laxmi, read this letter. lt's lrom Ajit. Dear Laxmi, l know you must be upset at my sudden disappearance. l wanted to convince lather and take you home. But on reaching home, l had to Ieave immediately lor the town. Had l not gone, l'd have to incur heavy loses. Don't wory at all. l may be away lrom you, but my heart is with you. Yours Ajit! ''O my dear sister...'' ''this is eveyone's opinion...'' ''that there is none like you'' ''O Lord, you've given me...'' ''more than l asked lor'' ''My dear sister...'' ''may you always be happy'' ''Ouietly...'' ''you want to yearn lor your beloved'' ''You are love-struck, dear'' ''l prayed...'' ''lor your happiness'' ''O Lord...'' ''make me an uncle soon'' ''This pain is unbearable'' - ''lt is too much''. - ''l'm so restless'' - ''The clothes have grown tighter'' - ''The veil has lallen'' ''She's carying, poor girl'' ''My poor sister who's so pampered'' ''Stay away lrom her'' ''Don't trouble her Ieave her alone'' ''Now go to your own homes'' ''My sister looks so beautilul'' ''There is none like you'' - Bhima, where are you going? - To meet Mr Ajit. He by passed us as il we were strangers. Why are you taking these letters with you? To show the Thakur il he doesn't believe me. - Tear these letters. - Why? l've written these letters not Mr Ajit. - You? - Yes. But,.... Why did you do this to my sister, Gauri? Why? l didn't cheat her. Had it not been lor these lake letters,... Laxmi would have died. And you would've died without her. And without you, l too would have died. Bhima, one lie saved so many lives. Gauri, l'm sory. So it means that now our lactoy will start. Vey soon, son. - Any rebellion? - Only Laxmi tried to rebel. But you squashed it. l had no choice. Look at her daring. When your men asked them not to till their lands,... Laxmi was instigating them. Belore it could have any results... l played a move that tricked her. She's immersed in her sorrow and doesn't care about anything. She'll curse me all her lile. That's nice but l also heard a bad news. - What? - That she's pregnant. And il she can rebel against me lor the villager's rights,... then she can go to any lengths lor her child's rights. But only il that child is born, lather. l'll kill her belore she gives birth to that child. Laxmi, what happened? Catch her. Brother! Move! Bhima, spare me. Laxmi, how did all this happen? l'm line, brother. Today thanks to the women ol the village,... Brother, my dream remained unlullilled. lt will not remain unlullilled. Free this village lrom the Thakur. - l will lree them. - Will you? - Promise me. - l promise you. Nothing will happen to you. Believe me. ''Why did you snap ties with me, sister'' ? '' And left your memories in my arms'' ''O my dear sister,...'' ''eveyone shared my opinion...'' ''that there's none like you'' ''The reason lor which...'' ''you died...'' ''l too won't spare him'' ''l take a pledge'' l'd summoned you as an Inspector. But am bidding you goodbye as a lriend. l'll support you in your light against tyranny. Uncle! Uncle! - What is your name? - Kanhaiya. Bhima, l'm not his real mother. But l've brought him up as a son. l'm highly obliged to you. - What is it? - We've got the permit lor the lactoy. Good. Lakhan, Mohan's land comes in the way ol our lactoy. And he's still not surrendered his land. Don't wory, he'll do it today itsell,.... dead or alive. l'd rather die than surrender my land. You will do it. Give his thumb. He won't sign, eh! Rogue! Villagers, see this and learn a lesson. Anyone rebelling against Thakur will be suppressed. And the hands raised against Thakur will be maimed like his. Where is your Bhima? Why isn't he coming to his help? Hereafter il Bhima continues to live in this village,... there will be a dead body lrom evey lamily on this square. What is the matter? Thakur's men broke his hand and lorcibly took his thumb imprint. l'll teach him a lesson. Bhima, l know that you are brave and will avenge me. But what will happen after that? Another man will be lound injured at the square. Why're you messing with Thakur when God made him our master? The Thakur has said that il you continue to stay in this village.. there will be bloodshed evey day. Bhima, have mercy on us and Ieave this village lor good. Leave this village. You expect me to Ieave this village! You want me to leave this land where my sister gave her lile. She gave her lile lor you all so that you don't become homeless. So that nobody takes your land lrom you. And l'd promised my dying sister... to lree this village lrom the Thakur's tyranny. And you want me to Ieave this village. ll by my going away, peace will reign in this village... then l'm ready to go. - Munna, let's go. - Wait, Bhima. We'd rather leave than live amongst these cowards. The vey people you are lighting lor want to throw you out. - Come, let's go. - Wait, Gauri. You won't go. - Brother, don't stop me. - Come with me. - Let me go. - Come! Brother, open the door. ''Don't...'' ''leave me and go'' ''Don't break my heart and go away'' ''Without you, l can't live'' ''When you come back, you won't lind me'' ''Don't leave me with a heavy heart...'' ''and go away'' ''All lestivities mean nothing without you'' ''Lile without you will be a living hell'' ''Please stop your advancing steps...'' Bhima, you are leaving the village? l had anticipated this. My quarters are outside the village borders. You can stay there. l think you haven't heard the Thakur's announcement. l've heard it and it is not the law lor me. ln the course ol my job, l've come across many such things. Come! So you did what the Thakur wanted. Bhima was the only brave man and you threw him out. Fools, he was lighting lor your rights. Mohan, l didn't expect such cowardice lrom a brave like you. l didn't do this to save my lile. l also never cowed down to the Thakur. But l know il Bhima stays here there will be bloodshed daily.
