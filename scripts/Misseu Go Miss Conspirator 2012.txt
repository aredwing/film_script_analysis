Sa Yeong Cheol's drugs, on top of that Paek Bong Nam's cash, they've already overtaken Busan's annual budget. The racket's getting bigger. Where is the transaction place? Undecided. So how should we do this? I'll tail Miss Go myself. How is it? How have you been these days? The thing is I probably should fasten a little bell on the cat thief. It's been 5 years since you were sent to infiltrate the cat's lair. You're more and more like a cat now. This will be the last time. Why would you be like that? You still don't get how it works around here. That is for me to decide. After this case is over, I'll immediately take off. Take off? The rotten punk isn't even using honorifics with me. The crazy bastard, why do we always have to meet in these terrible places? -= Movie Title: Miss Go =- Listen carefully to the sound of your heart. The changes in your thoughts, you must insist on changing your way of thinking. Do you want to kill me? Why would you do that? Why? Why? You counted up to 5, why go back to 4? Did I? I did it on purpose. It was a test. But, there is still a long way to go. You're still easily flustered by the outside world, Miss Su Ro. That's because of you, Doctor. You're making me so confused. What? There's just 4. How will this last for a week? These are extremely good. If you really can't endure it anymore, only then will you take one. You'll get immediate results. Then I will take this one for when Yeong Sim leaves the country. Miss Cheon Su Ro I know it isn't easy, but you must go to places you've never gone before and do things you've never done before. Don't forget, there is absolutely nothing in this world that can harm you, Miss Cheon Su Ro. See you next week. But, if you're scared of calling strangers, how will you order takeout? This is door number 28-3. We want one small bowl of sweet and sour pork, and one big bowl as well. This rotten punk! Try this again and I'll dig out your insides and make Jajangmyeon out of it! Really! This really isn't a joke. This is door number 28-3. One big and one small bowl of sweet and sour pork, and add in some extra soup. Okay? Let's drink. It's so hot. Eonni, I'll be gone in a blink of an eye. Do you want to leave me that bad? Aigoo It's just for two years, two years. Two years will be over immediately. Hey, rotten girl. Is two years a joke? Endure it. I can't. I'll just have some soju. No! What will I do if you're drunk? Eonni, don't you know how you are when you're drunk? When you're gone, what am I going to do with myself? Please don't go. Really... Let go, Eonni. So embarrassing. Didn't I tell you to be strong, Eonni? Aren't you sad? You're going to be away from me, don't you feel anything at all? I'm not one bit sad. What's with this? The boat's about to leave. Let go. Give me a call when you arrive. I can't. Phone calls are expensive. Eonni. (Eonni = elder sister) Listen to me carefully. You're on your own now, Eonni. If anything you should rely on yourself. No one will be there to comfort you when you cry. No one will be there to help when you're afraid. I believe in you. Oh God... It really is a sad story. Persevere. In this world, there are plenty of people more miserable than you, Agassi. As is the case with me. Being a woman of God, and actually falling for a man... But I can't keep on doing this mistake. That's why I'm hiding from him like this. It must have been hard for you. But do you know what's funny? I've already decided to leave, but I still bought him this gift. In fact, today is his birthday. Please give it to him. God will understand you. I can't do that. The moment I see his face, I know I'll just waver. It would be better if I just throw this away. Hold on, Sister. Can I help in delivering it for you? It's not necessary, that will be too troublesome. It's all right. You've helped me before. I want to. Let me do it. Oh God... You have arranged for an angel to come over. But where will I deliver this? Royal Hotel. Room number 618. What? I mean, I'll just write down the address for you. Ah, about that... It came with the cake, samples. Take it, Agassi. I don't have much use for this. Compared to a nun, you'll have even more opportunities for it. What the hell? Pervert! Fuck! Agassi! (Agassi = Young Lady / Miss) Is anyone there? Excuse me. Hello, I'm Cheon Su Ro. A sister sent me over to act as a messenger of love. She was very sad because she had to leave. So she prepared herself before leaving, and in tears, asked me to deliver this gift. You must be sad, too. That's right. Why wouldn't you be sad? It's like someone took a knife and thrust it into your heart like that. Am I correct? That seems to be the case. Both of you... Knife. Knife. You lunatic. The knife, pull it out. Put it back! You! How could you bastards kill a cop? We should've bailed out sooner. Sorry, Hyeongnim. But they just suddenly charged in with guns! It was self-defense, Hyeongnim. Then we should just report it to the police as self-defense then, mother fucker. But, Hyeongnim, if we go back up now, wouldn't that be too dangerous? Maybe they've already found out about it. This bastard has also been blinded. Would the hotel be this quiet if they'd already found the corpse? Hey, you stay here. Others follow me. We're in big trouble. Miss Go is dead. And there's a new woman. Okay. Room number 618, right? Yes, that's right. Wipe down any fingerprints and don't leave any evidence behind. Got that? Yes, hyeongnim. What? Hyeongnim, Miss Go already came. You're saying she's in the hotel? Yes. But... she had a bunch of yellow roses and was wearing some casual skirt. Casual skirt? Hyeongnim, take a look at this. Got that. Watch the doorway closely. What is this? This bastard's got something stuck on his back. What is it? It's like something you use to cut a cake. Cake? Miss Go, the bitch! What was that? What the heck is this? It isn't casual skirt. I am sorry. Hey! Find Ms. Go immediately! She goes in. Then I go in. We were both inside. Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! Red Boots. Red Boots showed up. You're asking me? I'm asking who? Come down, quick! Okay. Okay, I got it. It's no fun. Chairman. Can you pitch? What? The pitching machine's throws are really no fun. Throw one over. I'll hit from here. Let's see how you throw. - The bastard! - Hold it. Bastard! The bastard did it deliberately. I'm sorry. You should've given me some time to warm up. Come, try and get one past me again. You caught it. You got balls. Let's walk. Yeong Sim, what just happened? I'm so scared. Captain! Yes, please speak. Miss Go, her wings are already stiff, a blow in the back for me. What? It's nothing. It seems we and the Chairman have both lost quite the sum. How about another transaction? We should be clear about the accounts. Since I've already handed over the money, you guys have to provide the goods. With Miss Go... What can we do? She's already gone. I heard there's some girl mixed up with all of these. In determining who's to blame, Yeong Cheol should take care of that. I'm giving you guys two days. He's here. But what's strange is that Poisonous Toad's gang came back to the hotel. It's probably because of the drugs or the money, or possibly something else. What we're sure of is that they tried to cover their tracks. Hold it. There is a cake box here. Miss Go was holding that a while ago. That person and this person, they are the same person? It's unlikely. Is it her disguise? The knife then? Hey! That's... Do you know? Th- Th- That's... - Do you know her? - Who is she? Wasn't I asking you just now? I asked you. Go back to biting. In any case, transfers have not been made yet. But surely, both organizations will make a move today. So check the hotel's CCTV file, and find out about this woman's identity. The smell's really strong. People might think this isn't a marketplace, but a cemetery. What did you spill in these? Formalin? Maybe it's because of the greenhouse effect that these fish are listless. But if you're afraid that this will affect your sales, you don't need to worry. That wouldn't happen. That wouldn't happen? Of course, that shouldn't happen. Nothing should. This kid's really optimistic. But, what if something should happen? It won't, nothing will happen. Is that so? This punk's really optimistic. His character's really good. Laugh. Laugh, bastard! Laugh! Oh, you're here. My dongsaeng came back empty-handed. What went wrong? What did he say? He's giving us two days, for us to deliver the goods. The crazy bastard! When this deal's done with, we'll make him pick up his own stuff. We'll deliver the goods early, and just wait for the money. Hello. So let's start. I am Bang Hyeon Seop. Your age, Cheon Su Ro? taking everything into account. I was born in 1975. I'm just saying I'm one year older. Wow, that is pretty good. He's not the type to oppress amiably. Always at Door 10, 4th street, Sin Seon Dong District in Busan. Yes. But that... I lived in 5th Street Sin Seon Dong District until middle school. Then, it's possible we took the same bus, going back and forth. The moment I came in, I just felt like I've already seen you somewhere before. Hey, crazy bastard! Did you also fart in the bus? Are you on a blind date? Hey. Is she on drugs? Is she? Did you guys give that to her? Ah, he really is a scoundrel. To shift the blame on the bitch who gave birth to him, she ought to have nothing to say. Am I right? You're right, Hyeongnim. You get it, right? Although this may be broken, but this body still remembers. We ought to return what's due to him. Once the transactions over, I intend to make Miss Go our scapegoat. After we get our hands on that woman's money, we'll get rid of her. Then the goods? What? You're saying the drugs are fake? Cheon Su Ro Who is Miss Go? It really was my first time meeting her that day. Cheon Su Ro Did you know what was inside the cake box you were holding? It was drugs. Sell your worth and can't be bought back no matter how many times you try, that kind of drugs. Do you want to be in prison your whole life? That's why you should confess immediately. Confess now, Cheon Su Ro! She then collapses. Miss Cheon Su Ro Wake up, Miss Cheon Su Ro. Are you looking at me, Miss Cheon Su Ro? Do something, quick! - Miss Cheon Su Ro? - Miss Cheon Su Ro? Mommy! Doc... Doc... Doc... Doctor. Doctor. What's the situation? There's nothing wrong with her. Based on my review of the medical records of the other hospital, it's Panic Disorder. Ah, it's Panic Disorder. Be quiet. So it's Panic Disorder? Then what should we do? If it's Panic Disorder, then it looks like it's impossible for you to interrogate her in the police headquarter's interrogation room. Once there's an attack, it would be very difficult to control. Th- Th- Th- Th- Then-- I- I- I- I- I Got this. Just stop that. This... The problem is that she's a very important witness. I need her to provide some extremely important leads. Do you have any good ideas? Well, that... If she's drinking, the symptoms could ease up. Here, cheers! Cheers! So what is it that you want? Hey! My birthdate isn't even that far from 1975. You want me to take out my ID? Do you want to die? Don't be smug! Get on your knees! - ... or we could try this method. - Follow my words. Now we will begin by calling to mind some things. Of course, depending on the circumstances, there are people who can't be hypnotized. Right hand. Right hand. - Is there no other method? - Actually, there is this one, but it's a little extreme. Do you want to have one more go? Please save me. Really! Why are you so shy? That's why you should just say it. Look around, there's still plenty more rides we haven't tried. Do you want to do this all night? Or should we stop right here? Red Boots. Hotel... Arrest him, quick! An undercover agent? I couldn't tell. That's why he's an undercover agent. Just look at that face. Sit down. Exactly how much did Paek Bong Nam lose with this transaction? About 50 billion. If Paek Bong Nam finds out about the fake drugs... Then Busan will become a battlefield. But, the problem is... because of what just happened, Paek Bong Nam's and Sa Yeong Cheol's objectives have changed. What? Miss Cheon Su Ro. You. You're a big thing now. I don't know anything, really! Believe me, please. For Paek Bong Nam and Sa Yeong Cheol to kill our Cheon Su Ro, I reckon that's not too far away now. Our Cheon Su Ro, what should we do? Miss Cheon Su Ro, I will protect you. Why? I... uhm, that... Yes. - Uh... - Yes. Yes. I didn't mean to... Do you need my help? I want to die, really! Nowadays, I like drawing pure and innocent comics. But my original dream was to draw detective comics, those maddening speculative crimes. Ah... Ah... I see. Your drawings are pretty good. Of all these, I know just this one, the Myeongdong Cathedral. That is the Sagrada Familia Cathedral. I see. Beside it is the Barcelona jersey. Really... It was too loud. This is door number 28-3. We'd like one regular and one extra large order of Jajangmyeon. Jajangmyeon, one regular and one extra large. Door number 28-3. Ah, hold on. The peas of the extra large order... remove it! This is really delicious. It's good that Miss Cheon Su Ro likes to eat Jajang-- Someone's coming in. You must not come out unless I give the signal. Bastard! Are you all right? Blood. What should I do? what should I do? I'm all right. Those jerks... will definitely come back. We must leave immediately. Just grab what's important. Do you understand? Hurry. Here. What's this? There. It's done now. Honestly speaking, I envy you, actually. It would be better if I had a scar to show. I keep saying I'm in pain, but still people don't understand. "Why are you in pain?" "Where does it hurt?" "How painful is it?" It would be so much better if I could show them. So she didn't bring it along when you escaped? I don't think she brought anything unusual. Look carefully. That's 50 billion. Yes. There's only one tablet left. I can't. I'm going fishing tomorrow. I'll meet you at the passenger terminal at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. The drugs, you must take it there. Target sighted. Everyone on your toes. Cheon Su Ro's meeting with someone disguised as an angler. Until the transaction's over, no one must make a move. The transaction seems to have started. We should move now, sir. Wait for it, punk. Just be ready to make a move, got that? Those at my house hate it when I go fishing, that's why. These are my change of clothes. You must return these to me next time you go to the hospital. Please do this for me. If you can't do that, you can just put this in a deposit box. Just give me the keys later on, all right? The boat's about to leave. I'm going then. Doctor. Do you still feel like you're in the water being dragged down by your mom? You don't need the medicine. That... If you're still having this dream, just call out "Mommy". "Mommy". Did you get that? Officer Cha, go after the person she met with. Bang Hyeon Seop. Yes. Come with me. Hey, where are you Red Boots? Team 1, go check inside. Team 2, search the 2nd floor. Why is the Prosecutors' Office here? Yes, right. Hide. Captain The person she met with was Cheon Su Ro's attending psychiatrist. Seems like there was nothing going on there. Where did Cheon Su Ro go? Ah, about that... Take it, Agassi. Yes, Hello? I found the money. What money? Miss Go! Where are you now? At the passenger terminal. Exactly where at the passenger terminal? Deposit boxes at the first floor. From now on, listen to me carefully and do as I say. Hide behind the wall. Where are you? Get down low as much as possible. Turn right. I said turn right! Where are you going? Hello? What's the matter? Right now, there's a bunch of people who want to arrest you. That's why from now on, do as I say. What? Just do as I say, understand? What should I do? Can't you come over? I've already made a promise to protect you, Miss Cheon Su Ro, didn't I? I'm extremely close to you now, Miss Cheon Su Ro. So just trust me. Exit 1, Captain! Cheon Su Ro What should I do next? 3 o'clock, turn around right now. Don't go out yet. Right now, run! Go up to the 2nd floor. Hey, there! She's going up to the 2nd floor. Backdoor! She's here. Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop right there! Hey! Hey! Stop! Go down the stairs. Go left up ahead. Hey! Go left! What's going on? Please just drive. I'm sure to be dead if they ever get to catch me. Why? Are they arresting loose women? Yes? Cheon Su Ro! Cheon Su Ro! Where are you, Cheon Su Ro? Hello? This will do, right? I can't be seen, right? In short, I have outrun them. Yes. Let's meet at the house. Yes, Captain. Chief Eo! What's this? Since when did prosecutors start running on location? Let's go. Be well. Crazy assholes! Shook off the police? The chick's got skills. The money and goods are all in her hands. If she gets caught, the goods would also go down the drain. That would be a problem. That won't matter. We're already controlling the negotiation. It will do to just get the goods from Yeong Cheol. What is this? Isn't this him? I knew it, I knew it'd be like this. How many times have I said it? This bastard is a homo, didn't I say so? The other party is actually a police officer. This reckless bastard. You also know, although he is my dongsaeng, but he is a piece of garbage. This is fun. Are you having fun? This piece of garbage! What it means is that Red Boots is also a police officer. Do it this way. You guys find that woman and get back the goods. Figure out the rest, as you see necessary. Look at him. It's as if he's looking at me. Strip off its skin, scoop out its internal organs, he'll still hold on until his dying breath. If he should look down on me, not only will he be eating bad internal organs, he'll be meeting the King of Hell as well. You! I don't care how you do it, just find that woman, get the money back and get rid of her after. Make that bumpkin of a bastard see that what he's eating right now isn't lean meat, but rather internal organs. If it is indeed a drug case, those rats will surely show themselves one day. Until then just observe quietly. Yes. They still haven't found out about you, right? No. But Officer Seo, why do you stammer like that? So- so- so-- So as to make him appear feeble-minded, I asked him to do that. So that they wouldn't suspect. But it has now become a habit. As you've said, this will be the last time. Don't be late. You didn't sleep? These drawings, the drawings are really good. What kind of car is this? The chair's nice. It's the first time I've ridden a car like this. We've used this car yesterday and the day before. Is that so. - I-- - Yesterday-- Hello? Red Boots, you bastard. I'm in the middle of something. I'm hanging up. You thought we wouldn't find you if you went into hiding? You're this poisonous wide-mouthed toad. Such a filthy mouth. The son of a bitch. - Drive fast! - Yes. Go, go! Please hold on tight. There's this bastard. The homo son of a bitch. - Catch up with them! - Yes. Do you know how good this car is? He turned around. What should we do? - Let's switch places, fool. - Yes. I'll personally go up against him. Hurry! Get out of the way. You, in front! Get out of the way! Get out of the way now! Miss Su Ro! It looks like you have no other way out this time. Miss Su Ro What are you doing? Let's go. Anyway, you did well. Over there! Hyeongnim, this way. Hurry! Get them! Don't let them get away. What are you guys doing? These old women. Let go, now. My eyes really sting. Hurry, bastards! Look around! This dog. Get him! Did you bring the goods? I haven't even received the money, and you want goods? We haven't even met up with her when Miss Go died. Then what do you think should we do? Shall we do the exchange ourselves? Our Yeong Cheol has grown up a lot. He can now speak out, making suggestions as to what he thinks we should do. I've indeed grown up. I can now open up my heart to you, Chairman, like you said. Isn't that right, mother fucker? You! You called me here just to talk about these? In the future, just use KAKAOTALK if you have something to say. (KAKAOTALK - is a mobile messaging application in South Korea) Take a look inside. Yeong Cheol, I know you don't use your brains that much, but I didn't know you were also into raising cops. Why? Him being the dongsaeng next to your heart, it must hurt so bad. You must be so smart, as to have a cop for a dongsaeng. You, you should be the one to take care of this matter. You asked me why I called you out. I wanted to see your face, to see you completely torn apart. Get Red Boots over here. Once we hand over this bag to the police, this will all end, right? Finally, it's all coming to an end. Although I've experienced the fear and terror of going through hell, but still this was so much fun. Why are we here? Are we not going to the police headquarters? Did you both agree to meet here? So it actually is like that. I understand. After I hand over this bag, let's leave together. Cheon Su Ro, you had me worried for a while there. What happened with the bag is this-- I know, I know. I've already heard it from him, I know everything. Then can we leave now? We? It seems the two of you got along very well during this period of time. You suit each other. But what should we do? I still need a little bit of your time. Having said that, see that boat over there? Could you wait for a while on that boat over there? Boat? Are you not coming with me? He still has a lot of things he needs to deal with. After this, we'll have plenty of time. - Help the young lady. - Yes. Things will be settled right away, it'll only be a moment. This way. Hey, let's get going. Why is the boat running? Are we not going to wait here? This can't be happening. I'll surely die. Hello? I've thought about what you said, and I think I can't do that. Therefore, we'll just go on as planned. Hello? Captain? Captain! What's with you? The sea scape is really great. You really don't have any taste. Why are we at sea, and not at the police headquarters? It must have been hard for you lately, Cheon Su Ro. From the start, I thought you really were a bearer of ill luck when you appeared. But I've come to realize in the end, not only did you find the money, but you handed it over to me. You are not a bearer of ill luck, but a lucky star, my lucky star. Officer Bak! The sun's going down! Let's do it here. Yes, sir! What are you doing? Get up. Captain! - It's okay, it's okay. - Get up. Captain! Our hyeongnim cop has already woken up. Is there anything you want? You're thirsty? Here, drink this glass of wine. Now, open up. Stop being a dick. Our hyeongnim says we should stop being dicks. What should we do? We should let him have a look. Open up, bastard. Open that big mouth of yours, bastard. Stop it, you bastard! Grab him! Grab him quick! Grab him! Cheon Su Ro. Captain! When you get to the netherworld, buy something delicious. Both hands and feet. Hurry! Hurry! Don't move! Officer Seo, what's your business here? Untie that woman. How did this happen? Why is he on this boat? You sons of bitches! I- I was always onboard, keeping a close watch on all of you. Listen carefully to what I'm about to say. The money that's in there right now, wasn't taken from poor and pitiful people, it was taken from the scums of this world. We just want our share of this filthy money. How much of a crime is that? Not that much. It's 50 billion, 50 billion. Just cut the bullshit! This bastard really can't get the point? You startled me. Really. These bullets are blanks, stupid bastard. As a police officer, don't you know the pistol guidelines? Think about it carefully. - 3 - Don't. We should tie a stone to her body, so it will sink and the corpse won't drift ashore. You had me scared there. You didn't stammer on purpose, did you? You scared me to death, scared me to death. Captain! Hey, where did she go? Where did she go? Find her immediately, you bunch of idiots! Captain. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, Cheon Su Ro! What's wrong with you? Hey, hey! Cheon Su Ro! She jumped on her own? Eonni, Listen to me carefully. You're on your own now, Eonni. If anything you should rely on yourself. No one will be there to comfort you when you cry. No one will be there to help when you're afraid. Confess now, Cheon Su Ro! Can't you come over? I've already made a promise to protect you, Miss Cheon Su Ro, didn't I? Although I've experienced the fear and terror of going through hell, but still this was so much fun. If you're still having this dream, just call out "Mommy". Mommy! Counting in Red Boots, we each get 10 billion. Happy, right? But I'm telling you guys, when you resign don't act all cute and resign on the same day. We should discuss among ourselves when would be a good day. Take for example, I'm quitting tomorrow. Then the day after for me. I'm saying our Officer Seo suddenly isn't stuttering anymore. I still can't adjust to it. Officer Seo, are you flabbergasted because you've made quite the sum? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! This punk's so happy, he's completely lost his mind. - What are you looking at? Do you see the drowned Cheon Su Ro come back to life? - Yes. Hey, hey, hey. She really did come back to life. What are you blockheads doing? Hurry up and kill her. If you want to kill me just kill me. Now that I've grasped the idea that we all must die, I'm not afraid of anything anymore. But it'll only be your huge loss, if you kill me now. Hey, Cheon Su Ro. You living in this world, now that would be the our huge loss. Is that so? - What's this? - It's counterfeit money. Before this, I was planning on making you nab the handle, then use you as a scapegoat. But right now, you're already my trump card. I'll make you settle this. Bring it over. Eat. Don't move. Hello? Hey, where are you? This is the front of the gates of hell for this cop right here. Who are you? Me? The fucking owner of the money. It was so smart of you to take my money, you bunch of dead cops. If you want this bastard to live, just return my money when I'm in a good mood. Or else, I'll just slaughter this fucking cop anyway I want. What did they say? Captain, the money? Sa Yeong Cheol, he still doesn't know about the counterfeit money? Then the real money? So where is the real money right now? There was never any real money to begin with. What Paek Bong Nam handed over was really just counterfeit money. Paek Bong Nam, the son of a bitch. So this was just a transaction of fake drugs and counterfeit money? The fucking dicks! The fucking dicks! Sons of bitches! What do we do? What do we do? Cheon Su Ro, Your much smarter than we imagined, you can assess the situation clearly. I've read over a thousand detective novels. How should we do this? Do you want my help in changing what's fake to something real? What? Who is this? Someone's making a video call with me. And how should I call you, sweetheart? Miss Go II Is Red Boots still alive? I want to see. I want to see. Alive? I want to see. The conclusion of a traitor. Now let's talk about making a legitimate transaction. That's something we could talk about. We should discuss that transaction over wine. If I can't have that, then I'd be a little disappointed. The conditions are half the drugs worth of this money and Red Boots. That really is an interesting transaction. From Boss Sa's standpoint, you'll be earning twice as much without incurring any losses. If you don't agree, I'll just tell Chairman Peak that these are counterfeit money, then disappear. Wow, not bad. Looking at the current situation, it seems like you have no other choice. You can only accept my proposal. Is this a trap? Why should I believe you? Because what you sent last time was flour, which was such a headache. The money Miss Go had and the drugs I had are with the fucking houseflies right now. You'll earn twice as much. Think about it carefully. Assess the situation, then decide. Place. Time. I'll decide everthing. I'll notify you. Cheon Su Ro, now what do we do? I will now tell you my plan. We will make use of these two gangs ruse on each other. Give Sa Yeong Cheol the counterfeit money, in exchange for half of the counterfeit money's worth in drugs. We will then sell the drugs to Paek Bong Nam, get back half the amount equivalent of the real money. If it's like this, then one half of half is one quarter of the original number. So we get a total of 20 million. Compute that in Korean Won and it's 12.5 billion. Divide it to 5 and each one gets exactly 2.5 billion. But what about Red Boots? Red Boots' share will be mine including that bastard's life. Let's think of this white sugar as drugs, Slightly heated, it will give off a purple tinge. How about it? Can you do it? Miss Go II? You're even more beautiful in person. The transaction place is to my liking. -=The Police Headquarters=- The money? Red Boots and the goods? Your temper is really pressing. Watch closely, you punks. Car keys? You first. Your keys? He just hit her. You! This is your first time. What? How is it? Are you scared? I'll shout. So what if you shout, can you make a big enough noise? What about this? Will you open fire in this place? In front of cops? Do you have the guts? Try and shoot! Just shoot! I'm telling you to shoot! Shoot! Sa Yeong Cheol just fired a gun! Hyeongnim! This insane woman! Block him with the car. It's nothing! It's nothing! Everything's fine! We are also police officers. We just had a small collision, that's all. It was this punk's fault. Boss Sa, since were already here, how about surrendering quietly? Fuck. I have a request. Shut up! How can I just turn my back on this? Don't go back to the captain. After he's done using you, he'll just kill you. Just go and run away. I told you to shut up! Why didn't you personally end it with me? Hurry and escape. No. I'll finish everything off, once and for all. In my heart, you're already dead. I was worried you wouldn't show up, Cheon Su Ro. Red Boots? You really killed him? You did well in killing him. Gun? I'm asking about the gun. I threw it away. Committee member. There is this saying in baseball, it's not about force when batting, it's about timing. Hit right, it will be a home run, if not then it's a dead ball. If we can't get the timing right, then you and I are both dead. - Chairman. - What is it? You need to take this phone call. I am Miss Go II, Mr. Chairman. What did you say? The money are all counterfeits. You guys, cover this side. You guys, over there. Yes, hyeongnim. Cheon Su Ro! You've changed a lot. Were you really a Panic Disorder patient? This seems like it's for the Chief. Someone sent you this, Chief. What is this thing? Pass this on to Hyeongnim. If he wants to get the money from Chairman Paek, he should come to the passenger terminal right now. I'm just a little worried. If Paek Bong Nam should kill Cheon Su Ro, then you guys would get proper evidence of the shoot down. So we won't be saving her? In any case, after this matter is over, Cheon Su Ro... she's going to be dead. There. Cheon Su Ro's final performance. You look very familiar. We've already met before, right? It seems like he recognizes her. Ah, hotel elevator. Hotel. Night club? I don't have the time to play with you. Ah, yes. Yes. She's here, Chairman. So, you are Miss Go II. Is there a Miss GO III too? Did you come alone? Let me see the goods. Wait a minute. The money. It shouldn't be counterfeits this time. I need to make sure first. Okay. Okay. The goods are real. What are they doing? I'll go take a look. Hey. Let's wait for a while, first. Miss Go II What was that? What do we do? What are you bastards waiting for? Get them! Yes. Hey! You guys catch Paek Bong Nam. Hurry and go, bastards! Stop the car! Stop! We're the police. Get out. Get out of the car now! What is going on? Where is she? Where did she go? Hey! Cheon Su Ro! Really! Don't come any closer! I said don't come any closer! You bunch of hoodlums! Don't move! Don't come any closer. I really will shoot. If you don't want to die, you bastards better not make a move! Don't move. This bunch of hoodlums. Stay still. Stop moving. Mr. Paek Bong Nam. Open up. It's the police. Hand over the bag, bastard. - Captain. - Captain. Where did the drugs go? Where's the drugs? The woman you just killed, where is she, bastard? Are you high? Fuck! Who are they? The people who should've come came. It's the retard. If you guys are having fun, I should be in on the fun too. The whole pack of hooligan bastards have all showed up now. Our Captain also has some accounts to settle here. Go and take a look. Yes. Don't move, bastard. Take one more step forward and I'll blow your brains out. What do we do? I took a step forward. The way I look it, this bastard doesn't want to live anymore. Attack. Sa Yeong Cheol Jeez. Forward! Hands up in the air. Hey! Put your hands up! Hey, Sa Yeong Cheol. Throw the knife away. Yeong Cheol, you still are inexperienced. Will I croak if you stab me with the knife you have there? Fuck! Why are the supervisors of police officers all here? The narcotics division came upon some intelligence. Organized crime syndicates' and shady police officers' drug trades. Based on what? Do you have any evidence? The evidence is right over there. Evidence, it's also in here. Let go! Don't come near me. Don't do anything stupid! Put the gun down! Poisonous Toad! Chairman. From now on, you should do what I say. Come a little closer. Captain Seong is monitoring us on CCTV right now. There are cameras. Look over there, there's one there. There's one at the back. And another one there. These 3 cameras will always be monitoring you. So there's no need to worry. It's the dance of happiness. Yes, it's confirmed. Don't be surprised. This is all just for show. As for the rest of the drugs, I've already hidden them in a safe place. It's been a while since I've seen graffitis like this. It's this kind of stuff that moves people into wanting to draw. Aigoo. Yes, it's here. Take the gun out, right now. Miss Go II The chick's quite smart. Do you like baseball? -= One week later Osaka, Japan =- Quickly! Quickly! -=You're not allowed to go!=- -=Me? I am foreign student from South Korea... I only want to eat Ramen...=- This stupid bastard! -=What did you eat last night?=- -=Eel... roasted, with soy sauce...=- -=This morning?=- What? -=...Sushi=- -=Sushi early in the morning?=- -=Because I like sushi...=- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Idiot. No money for phone calls, but you're eating just about everything! Eonni, how can you be here? Who are these people? My bodyguards. What's happening here? Yeong Sim Let's go!
