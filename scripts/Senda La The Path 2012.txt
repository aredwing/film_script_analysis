It's going to get in your eyes. Keep still. Where did you put it? You're not even going to tell me? God, you're so paranoid. Lonely kids invent other people. It's his imaginary friend. Didn't you ever do that? Who do you expect him to play with? With you? How dare you throw snowballs at me? Guys, let me get a photo. "One, two, three... " Check the list, that's what it's for. Okay, I will. Take him with you. Come on, honey, go with Daddy. Forget it, he'll get over it. Nico, take a look at what's in there. Tell me something Are the puppets handmade? Yes. Samuel, the carpenter, makes them. You must know him. Yes, we do. Do you want one? They're very cheap. Okay, yes, I'll take one. Which do you like? The green one. Is it a gift? Yes. For the boy? Yes. He seems like a nice guy. Samuel? Yes, he's a good boy. Although, he sometimes gets into trouble. Trouble? Yes, women, you know.. He really likes women. Don't we all? What's up, Daddy? What? I forgot to put bay leaves on the list. Okay, I'll run into the village. No, don't worry, I'll go. I need some air. Okay, but don't you want me or Nico to go with you? No, you don't need to See you later. Hi. Hi. There weren't any bay leaves. Oh, that's a shame. There were no suckling pigs left, They gave me an older one We'll end up throwing half of it away. Why don't we invite Samuel to supper? Samuel? Yes. I don' know. It's really a family occasion. Nico spends too much time with just us. He's bored. It will be more fun if he comes That's true. But I thought you didn't like him. Nonsense. He's a nice guy. He's done us lot's of favours. Besides, who else do we know around here? I'll ask him. I know where he lives. HEY. cool!. What do you say, Nico? Thanks. Don't thank me. Santa delivered it to me by mistake, but there was a note saying it was for you. What a great idea of Santa's. Too bad we won't be able to keep him. We don't have room. Not at your apartment. I can keep him when you're gone. I hope the boy doesn't grow too fond of him. Well, we'll see. I'm going to serve supper. Look, Mum, he wants milk. Would you like a drink? A good red wine beats any white wine, right? I agree. Do you like suckling pig? I'm sure it's delicious. It looks excellent. Here, Nico. My wife is a great cook. He's kidding. I'm not, and I know it. I say it again, you're a great cook. Don't drink too much. Why not? It's Christmas, let's enjoy it. Have some more wine. I love my work, but there isn't much to do. An odd chair that breaks, doors that need refitting, and with a bit of luck, a coffin Nico, time for bed. If Santa comes and you're awake, he won't leave any presents. And the doggy? He's staying here. Say goodbye to Samuel. Bye Cahmp. Give Daddy a kiss Merry Christmas, son. It's about time I was going. Don't you want to say goodbye to Ana? Stay and have one for the road. Want some? No, thank you. Samuel, I know that you and my wife have been seeing each other. What for? Don't you trust her? What did you need to her alone for? I can't tell you. I promised to keep it secret. Be patient. I had a very pleasant evening. Won't you stay a while now that Nico is in bed? No, I'm sorry.This is late for me. Besides, a storm is brewing. If I don't go now, I'll have to sleep here. Of course. Hold on. Let me get a photo to remember this moment. Come on, over by the tree. Right there. Good. Closer together. Perfect. Okay, Nico, hurry up. Let's get ready. When? Soon. I want to open my presents. We have to wait for Daddy. I want to open them now. You're deathly pale. Did you see a ghost? I had a nightmare. Okay, you can open this one. Don't you like it? It's got loads of stickers. Now you've got the baddie. I got Samuel to make them. As a surprise. Hence all the secrecy. He has done an excellent job. Ana.. If only you knew what I had imagined. I'm an idiot. Honey.. I'm still wearing the first one. Ana, forget about the past. We've just been reborn. Honey, I fancy making a sponge cake for you two. Mmm, that sounds good. I'm going to the village. Nico's staying. Okay. Nico, get in the house! Lock the door. Doggy, no! Stop! Come here! Nico, stay back! Doggy, no! Stop! Saty back! Careful! Nice little doggy. Calm down. No! Nico... This never happened, okay? What will happen to doggy now? Will he go to heaven? No Then what? I don't know. Hi. Hi. What happened to you? An accident. I was trying to cut some wood, wasn't I, Nico? You cut yourself? It's okay, it's just a scratch. You're so useless.You should have called Samuel. I know. What are you doing out here? I thought I saw someone. Nico.. Nico.. On I love you so much Mum.. Mummy.. What are you doing? What's the matter with you? Come here, Nico. What are you doing? He's afraid of you. What about you? Raul, please. Hey you! Where are you going? Raul? Yes? Come on out, we have to talk I'll be right out Nico, you've finished, right? I only had a couple. Don't make excuses. I knew you'd crack sooner or later. I'm going through a hard time. I know. Smoking is the least of it. We're leaving. We'll take the puppy with us. It'd be cruel to leave him behind. Yes, I guess you're rig ht. You said if it didn't work out. Don't worry. It's better if you leave. You're not coming with us? No. It might do me good to be alone here for a few days. Can you take us to the village to catch a bus? Sure. Friends? Say goodbye to Samuel for us. Sure. What a beautiful farewell. Too bad it didn't happen that way. Did you like the chess pieces? Of course you did. Your wife told me how you like them Well-polished. You bitch! Raul! Go outside! Sir, I think you should see this Honey, where are you?
