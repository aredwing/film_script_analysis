It's me, Marek. The other day, you said, "Come." Here I am. No, I don't know you. I don't know what you want. Go. You can't stay here. Don't touch me or I'll yell! It's not right to do this. It's not right. I'm a minor too. What? I'm a minor. You tell me, "Come." But I'm only 14, it's illegal. What is it you want? What do you want? This is a good door. A security lock, right? I'm not answering that. Got an alarm? I'm calling the cops. Yes, there is an alarm. Want to show me round? Beautiful apartment. Are you the owner? Yes. That's good. This is where to buy a place. Cheaper than Paris but as good. Property prices keep rising here. How much was it? I can't remember. Of course you can. You don't forget that. Around 600,000. I forget now. Francs? Yes, francs. It was 15 years ago. That's what? 80,000. 90,000 euros. That's good. Very good. Don't touch that! It's a big place. You live alone? Yes. Boss! You work out? It doesn't show. Maybe it's too late. You've eaten too much. You don't move enough. And now you're old. I don't want to be old. I want to stay in good shape, muscular and clean. Fat-free. Because this body, see, is the most important thing that God has given us. These machines are no use, you know. What counts is the body's resistance. The body's resistance to itself. Look at me! Go on... Touch. It's free. Well? Got a hard-on? You play at that? How old are you? What are you doing? Can't you see that's fragile? That's not right. We're friendly with you. We're talking, we're having fun... And you, you yell at us. That's not right. I can raise my voice too. You're the one... who came after us at the station. You're the one who told us to come. You're the one. We'll fix your fridge. Don't worry. I love this one! 3 - WHAT WE MAKE TOGETHER Yes? Want something to drink? Water? We said 50? Yes? Hello. Hello. No, come up. Yes, of course. What? Just tell your friends to bring it back. You understand? Yes, that's him. Before. Long ago. A long time ago. What? Dead? No, why would he be dead? Yes, it works. When will you be back? I need to know when you'll be here. I go out, I work, I see friends. I have to know. When can you come in the week? Not in the afternoon. I work. In the evening? Every Monday evening? And at the weekend? I want to see you twice a week. At least. This is the hand. The hand. The finger... The arm... The shoulder... The breast... The nipple... The neck... The chin... The mouth... The smile... Your smile... My smile... To suck. A verb. I suck you. You want to smoke? No, not here. On the balcony. So where are you from? Moscow? I thought you were all Russian. And what are you? Are you OK? They hurt? Let me see. Let me see. You need a dentist. Get them seen to. No papers. That's not a problem. See that street? At the end of it, there's a square. On the square, there's a health centre and it's free. They won't ask for your papers. You can go when you want. And do a test too. Just to be sure. I know, but just in case. You'll go? You never sleep here. I can't. Why not? Your friends? You mean the gang? You told them you come here? See you. Can you bring the glasses? - I can stay here tonight. - Really? - Tonight? - Yes. All night. That's great. What? Not now. We're eating now. We're eating. Don't touch. - It's not right. - OK. You're beautiful. So beautiful... Has anyone ever told you that? You're very beautiful. Everything OK? What? I wanted to say something. You come here two or three times a week. I give you 100 or 150 euros. Plus food and stuff that I'm glad to give you. I was thinking maybe we could agree on a set rate. What's a set rate? A set rate is a sum of money, always the same, that I give you each month. For instance, 300 euros. 300 euros. Or 400. At the start of each month. Then you can come here when you want. What? 500? No, I can't afford 500. 400 is already a lot. But I want... an iPhone. We'll see. - Yes, an iPhone. - We'll see. OK, stop now. Think about it, all right? And we'll talk again. I have to go. Sleep as long as you like. Just slam the door behind you. Didn't you say you were Ukrainian? Yes, I'm Ukrainian. So why Chechnya? You lived there? My father worked in Chechnya. So we lived there. With my sister too. And your parents... They still live in Chechnya? In Chechnya, it was the war. One day, my father... left the house. He went to work. He didn't come back. Ever. He didn't come back? He died? After, a long time after, there was a lot of rain. And the river... got bigger. It came into the city. Everywhere. I was with my big sister. We saw. There were dead people, a lot of dead people. Dead people without heads. There were arms... legs... in the river... My sister... she's sure... she saw my father. Did you see him too? No. It wasn't him. She dreamt it. So you don't know if he's dead. He is. I meant you're not sure. Yes, I'm sure, he's dead. And your mother? She's dead too. What? It's true. A bomb hit our house. My mother was alone. She was sad anyway. Sad? What do you mean? Why are you asking me all this? Don't you believe me? Of course I believe you. First of all, my name's not Marek. My name's Rouslan. That's my real name. Why don't you believe me? It's the truth. Calm down, Marek, I believe you. Rouslan! You see? You don't even believe my name's Rouslan. I have to get used to it. Changing names isn't easy. If you don't believe my name's Rouslan, you don't believe anything. That's not right. My name, you don't care. My family, you don't care. The bombs, the war, you don't care. It's all true. I'm not joking. How do you say in French... You trust me. And you... You don't trust me. No, forget it, I'm sleepy. But I want to. Cut it out. Please... - No, I don't want to. - Please! You're such a kid. I'm sleepy. It's me. Listen... I don't know why you won't call. I'm starting to get worried. So give me a call. I'll be waiting. Rouslan? What's up? What's going on? I've done something stupid. What have you done? The others... They saw my phone. So? They're not pleased. Boss, he sees I have new things. The T-shirts... All that... He's not happy. Are you OK? I'm tired. Come and rest. Come on, come to the office. Go on. You should stay here today. No, I mustn't. The others will suspect something. Are you sure? Don't worry. You know, they're my friends after all. Boss is a little crazy sometimes. But he doesn't scare me. Don't worry. Are you sure? Cut it out, it's OK. I'll be here tonight. I can do electrics. Yes, electrics. Finish the lights. I can do the painting too. I don't mean doing work here. I mean a job. You can't live on what I give you. I don't know. I never thought about that. I live well with the others. With the gang? How much longer will you do that? I don't know. Right, I'm going to bed. Sleep in the office if you want. If you want. Yes, I'd prefer that. I've made up a bed. But do we fuck first? No, don't bother. I'd prefer you to get some rest. I'm sleepy, anyway. What's the matter? What are you doing here? Nothing. What's wrong? Tell me. You don't want me any more. What? You want me to leave. I don't want you to leave. Don't make fun of me. I'm not making fun. What, then? I'd prefer you to sleep in the other bedroom. That's all. It's not a bedroom. It's an office. You don't want to fuck me any more. You don't want me. Listen... I don't want us to sleep together any more. We'll make a room for you. OK? Your room. But I don't want to pay you. You'll just have pocket money. I want to know where you are, what you do. And stop seeing the others. They scare me. They scare you too. Do you have your papers or not? You mean a passport? Yes, a passport, a visa... I have a passport. We'll need it. We can't do anything without papers. - So you have them? - Yes, but... Boss keeps our papers. In a safe. A safe? Yes, in the hotel. Where's the hotel? It's far away. Far away. No, please. Leave the bins alone. That's not allowed, sir. Please... I'll just check on the second floor. The Visa machine's acting up. I'll see to it later. 4 - HALT HOTEL DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS Good morning. How is everything? Hi. Are you sulking? Cut it out! Do the baby's bottle. Marek! Can you get a bottle of milk? - A big one or a small one? - Whatever. Why are you sad? I hate it when you're like this. I'm not sad. I'm just tired. Come on, it's Sunday today. We'll be together all day. I can't manage... to relax any more. I'm going for a shower. Can you see to the bottle? I'm taking a quick shower. That's a neat jacket. - I've had it a while. - Yeah? OK, I'm going. Hi. Excuse me, can you leave us, please? I'm all set. Listen... Listen to me... I'll try to hurry. Who was that? Stay out of it! - Who were you talking to? - No one! Little wanker. Pain in the ass! Marek! Come here! Not eating with us? You look weird... I'm OK. Why do you say that? I don't know. You seem on edge. No, I'm the same as usual. Eat an egg, it'll help! A problem, sir? Can I help you? No. I've forgotten my number. Gently! Sir, what are you doing? Sir! Number 27. I told you, right? Have you forgotten? Bottom row, on the right. Open it. Come on, I'll help you. Happy now? Is everything there? You see! Let's go. What's going on here? To the storeroom. Where are you going? Stay here. So where's the pretty jacket from? I bet it cost a lot. Can I try it on? Your new friend gave it to you? He gave you his key? You want to split? Just like that? After everything we've been through... Why do you need your papers? What the hell are you planning to do with them? You'll get yourself fucking deported! Besides, am I stopping you from leaving? Fucking go ahead! If we're free, why do you hide our papers in a safe? What are you talking about? What safe? It's a locker, asshole! You just needed to ask. Asking is easy enough. I'd have given them to you. What are you going to do? Live with that guy? He saw your pretty mug at the station one day and now you're Mr Right? Think you're better than us? Your guy's getting worried... It's for you. Careful, you'll crush his head! All right... Tie him up. It's no big deal, OK? It's just to teach him a lesson. He's bleeding! - He's in a bad way. - No, he's just fainted. What's going on here? It's nothing. None of your business. Everything in this hotel is my responsibility. Who's this kid for starters? Your little brother? He's not my little brother. Surely he's not your son? No. So who is he? Whoever you want. What'll he do with him? He's bleeding, he's unconscious. Maybe we should call a doctor. - Hello. - Hello, sir. I'm looking for a young man called Rouslan Guerasiev. - Do you have his room number? - No, I don't. - What was his name again? - Guerasiev. No, I can't see him. He's with a group of young people from Eastern Europe. In that case, we don't get the names. We only know the number of people we have. - Have a good day. - You too. I understand. Actually, I'd like a room. I have a room free on the second floor. That's where they all are. Perhaps you'll find your friend. Perfect. - I'll take you up. - Don't trouble yourself. It's no trouble. I have to check something. - Everything OK? - Yes, fine. She's back. Here you are. What was that? I don't know. Probably nothing. Is someone there? Sir? Yes, sir, can I help you? What were those groans? I'm sorry? You heard them too. From the next room. Why? Is there more noise? No, everything's quiet. But you seemed worried. Worried? No. Do you know who's in that room? No, I'm not really sure. What if it was him? Who? The young man I'm looking for. Rouslan. Why do you think it's him? Actually, I'm sure. It's him. I can't reach him. He could be in danger. Sorry, sir, I'm not following this. Who are you? And who's this person you're looking for? It's a young man I'm looking after. Fine, but what can I do? You turn up here... You don't understand. I need your help. And he needs your help too. Couldn't you open the door? Just to see. No, sir, I can't just open doors like that. It's not allowed. Not allowed? Someone cleans the rooms! Not those rooms. Social services run those rooms. Those people aren't hotel guests. So you can't do a thing? If you're sure that your friend is in there and that he's in danger, I can call social services. No, social services will send the police and they'll all be arrested. Maybe that's the solution. No, it's not a solution. Forgive me for disturbing you. You're not disturbing me. Sir, please... Rouslan? I'm here now. It's all right, we're leaving. What the hell... Where is he? Shit! I'm getting Boss. Go on. What is this shit? Where's the key? - Did you open it? - No, I locked it. - And no one saw you? - No, it was locked. - Hey, you there! - Yes, sir? What's going on here? I don't know... When I come back, someone's been in my room and taken stuff. Really? That's odd. Look... - Know what this means? - What does it mean? It means that the person who came in has the key. I don't know. Maybe it was one of your friends. No. It was someone with a pass key. No, but... I don't have a pass... Are you crazy? Chill, Boss. Don't worry. We'll find Marek. Police, how can I help you? Come to the Halt Hotel now. Things are degenerating... What do you mean? What are you doing? Some undocumented immigrants... You have to get here fast... What exactly is happening? Is everything OK? We can't just let this happen. We have to do something. Sir, what just happened here? Nothing. Nothing at all. Where do you think you are? You can't just hit people! I'm talking to you! We're sorry. He didn't mean to. - He's sorry. - Hold on... I never went in there and I didn't take anything. Maybe it was you, then. It was you... The fucking bitch who went into my room. Are you some cop? The cops! The fuzz! Let's split! Bring the children too. Get the family out. You have no choice. You have to come. Stop! Rouslan, we have to go now. Cut it out! Calm down! Stop! Don't be afraid. Get in. Don't worry. It's going to be OK. I'll fucking waste you, bitch! Sir, we're seeking a fugitive. Have you seen anyone? No, no one. All right. Thank you. Stop! Where do you think you're going? Fuck... Your honour, serious doubts remain concerning the relationship between the two applicants. Their initial encounter and their living arrangements do not allow us to establish a filial bond. I fear the law may be used as a way to naturalise the adoptee. Your Honour, I wish to dispel any ambiguity concerning my clients' relations. If, as the prosecutor implies, the relationship were of a sexual nature, my clients would have simply opted for a civil union. I think we have everything we need to reach a ruling on this case. Mr Daniel Arthuis and Mr Rouslan Guerasiev, we shall inform you of our decision on November 25. Don't worry, it's a simple adoption. There's no reason to oppose it. You just have to be patient, OK? Sorry, I have to go. Goodbye. Adaptation: Ian Burley Published 12/03/2015
