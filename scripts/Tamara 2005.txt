My God! - What's happening? - I could never love you. Help me. Tell them you love me. Make them stop! Tamara! Tamara! Tamara! - No. - Tamara? Are you okay? The theme of duality. The idea that we can do good or evil has been here forever. From Cain and Abel all the way through to modern pop culture... but many believe there is a devil tempting us to do bad things. Others believe the potential lies solely within each one of us. ''Journey Into Witchcraft''. I think you've already made that journey. I've got to say, it looks like you've had a really rough trip. Enough! Another detention and I'll have to teach you again next year. Grab a copy of ''The Gazette'' on your way out. And don't forget, quiz on Monday. Tamara? I've got some great news for our star pupil. We're asked to submit editorials, the paper picked the best one. Again, you've impressed me with your intelligence and passion. Congratulations. Kisha, there's the bitch who wrote the article. Somebody call Animal Control. One of those drug-sniffing dogs is off its leash. Back off! Mind your own business. I'm making this my business. What? You've got something you want to say? Come on, ladies. We don't have time for these losers. You okay? Don't worry about them. They've been assholes forever. Seriously. They think they're hot now. But, in ten years... they're gonna be fat, bitter, divorced alcoholics. Tamara! Don't move! Tamara! Tamara, what's wrong? Tamara, get back here. She went into Natolly's room. - Let me have a word with them. - No, please! Tamara, about this drug testing. It's not your fault. Administration's been planning it for months. Look, if anyone bothers you, I want you to come to me, okay? I'm sorry about the paper. I just wanted to encourage you. It's made so many people mad. Nobody liked me before... That's not true. I like you. I'm sure a lot of other people do too. High school can be tough. Just be strong. ''This too shall pass.'' Are you using famous literary quotes to make me feel better? I'm an English teacher. Famous quotes are my arsenal. - Is it working? - Yes, I guess. You've got a lot going for you, Miss Riley. Let people see it. You're very special. You just have to find your place in the world. - Tamara, it's fine. It's fine. - I'm so stupid. No, Tamara. It's... What? Now you don't have anything to say? You didn't have trouble shooting your mouth off for the paper. ''It's no secret that some of our star athletes... are using performance enhancing drugs. But due to the team's success, the coach has remained silent.'' - Busted! - Shut up, dick! Thanks to you, the coach tried to get me to piss in a cup. You're going down. I'll see you soon, you trailer trash whore. Maybe you could take it and we could switch samples. It's too late. What happened with Coach? He benched me... for the rest of the season, cause I didn't take the test. Do you know the scouts will come next month and I won't play? I'm sorry. - That freak's ruined everything! - It's okay, baby. It's okay. - You're home early. - I don't want to talk about it. - Stuart's closet needs cleaning. - I'll do it later. I'm going to my room for a while. I've had a really bad day. Well, my day's been one big fucking tea party! You guys are not going to believe what I saw. Tamara made a move on Mr. Natolly. She tried to kiss him. And he totally shot her down. You've got to be kidding me. He was all like: ''Someday, you'll find your place in the world.'' You know?. I think it's time we teach that loser a lesson. What's wrong? Nothing. - Honey, what's wrong? - Tamara's got a crush on me. She'll be fine. I think she's more embarrassed than anything. When are these geris gonna learn they're no match for a woman? I think I might have some news that will cheer you up. We may have to start redecorating. - What do you mean? - I don't know. I was thinking maybe some pink, or maybe some blue. Are you serious? I think we may have actually done it this time. God, that's great! There he is. Roger! What's up? Listen, there's gonna be a party tomorrow night. A party? - Do you think you can make it? - Do I think I can make it? Yes, but only if you stop repeating everything I say. Look, pardon my scepticism... but we hardly hang out in the same social circles. It's senior year, man! Time to put aside this petty high school bullshit... and have fun. Please tell me you just said fun. - Who are you? - Jesse. What's up? I just moved three months ago from LA. The fresh air is great. But the social scene sucks. No clubs, no raves. But they're having a barn dance next month, so... There won't be any farm animals... but I'm having a kick-ass party tomorrow night if you wanna come. Totally. Chloe too? - I don't think that I can. - What? Come on. I guess. Awesome. Roger here was just bailing. - No, I can attend. - Great! - I'll call you with the address. - All right. Having fun! Having fun without you? One more thing. You still work at the AV centre? What's wrong with you, girl? You've been up here all afternoon. You think this magic shit's gonna make you feel better? Of all the habits to pick up from that no good mother of yours. Couldn't learn to cook. I'm sorry. I tried to make things work with her. Sometimes love isn't enough. No. Love isn't enough. I'll make you love me. To the ancients who were before time... hear my prayers. I supplicate myself before you. Now ready to make the sacrifice you desire. To the old ones, endowed with powers of love and attraction... bind my fate to that of the one I desire. Bill? And like this flame, like a phoenix from the ashes... let me rise anew to claim all that should be mine. Honey? With a touch, grant me the power to sway others to do my bidding. And destroy those who stand in my path. For this, I offer up my heart... my soul... my blood. I spill it in your name. Yes, some witch. What are you doing? Hello? Tamara? What? I can't hear you. lt's my cell. Reception's bad. It's Bill. l had to call you. l've thought about what you said. And l want you to know that I care for you too. This isn't Mr. Natolly. l told you that someday you'd find your place in the world. l'd like that place to be with me. - But what about Mrs. Natolly? - We're having problems. l don't want to talk about it over the phone. Can you meet me tonight? Yes! Come to the Capri Motel. Room 39. 17h30, okay? Tamara, l've been dreaming about this for a long time. l'd love to spend the night with you. I'd like that too. Great. l'll see you then. I love you. I love you. It worked. You are just so cruel. What is taking him so long? With all the freshmen he's done here, he should have a line. We got both the rooms. Phase one is complete. Why are we getting two rooms? Have you ever heard of exotic dancers, Rog? I mean, of course. Just help me unload this video gear. Hello? Are we early? No. It's gonna be a small party. Yes, my folks are going out of town soon. That's when we're having the big blow- out at my house. ''Patrickpalooza 5'', baby. - What's up, man? How you doing? - How you doing? Alright, it's shot time, people. Let's make it happen. It's okay, I got us some wine. So, she is tough to go or what? So, about the locker room. I'm sorry. I'm glad you could come. No problem. But you really should give Tamara a break. She's a cool girl. All right, cheers. - Now that's one quality libation. - You know what I'm talking about? Shawn, phase two? Yes, I'm just going to the car to get some more beer. Bill? - Is that the dancer? - It sure is. - What is this? - A late night entertainment. You guys know how to party, man! - Tell me you love me, Tamara. - I love you. Welcome to reality TV, bitch! You didn't say it was her. My God! I can't believe you actually thought he would sleep with you. You look like a cheap ugly whore! Tell me where she is right now! That fucking dress. You fucking loser. Tamara! You? It's not what you think. - I trusted you! - No, wait! Tamara! Film that! Tamara! Tamara! Somebody shut her up! Stop! Stop! Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her! Tamara, please, stop. Bitch! Tamara? Is she all right? - I can't feel a pulse. - Move! Move! She's dead, isn't she? - Isn't she? - No. No. Wait. Let's think about this. What's there to think about? She's dead! I know. There's nothing we can do for her. We can figure this out. - Just calm down. - Calm down? - We killed her. - Shut up! No one killed her. It was an accident. I am not throwing my life away because of this loser. If we all keep our mouth shut, everyone will think she ran away. No one has to know. - Are you out of your mind? - Listen, you little shits! You all struggled with her. Call the cops. And I'll tell them that you and your boyfriend set this up. That you were fighting with her when she fell. It'll be your word against mine. I've already got a record. I'm not going to jail. No way. Roger? I didn't know. God. - You're not like them. - This is so wrong! But I have a scholarship and I guess... I can't believe I'm hearing this. Chloe? She scratched me. You too. They're going to find our skin under her nails. Your hair's in her hand. It's five against one. I've got videotape to back up my story. Who do you think they're gonna believe? All right. So, what's your fucking plan? We never talk about this. Ever! Let's finish it and get out of here. Wait. This is really wrong, burying her out here like this. We can still call the police. It's not too late. We've already decided. Let's finish it and get out of here! Leave him alone! I'm afraid it's too late. I'm done. Can I go to the bathroom? Watch it! You look a little pale. Is something wrong? Sorry, I'm late. Rough weekend. I almost died getting here. You'll have to take a make-up test. Time's up people. Hand everything in. Is something wrong, Jesse? Thank you. Can I talk to you for a sec? Sure. About Friday. I was just feeling a bit vulnerable. It's okay. Are you all right now?. As you can see, Mr. Natolly, I'm better than all right. I'm perfect. - What's up? - It's Tamara. She's alive. - She just walked into class. - But how?. She must have been unconscious. No, she was dead. Chloe and I checked. - Obviously, we were wrong. - Did you guys talk to her? Hell no, I didn't talk to her! I was busy shitting my pants. Then, we'll go to her and say, ''We didn't mean to hurt you.'' I'll make sure she keeps her mouth shut. We tried it your way and buried her alive. I'll talk to her. What about how she looks now?. Come on. She'd give Halle Berry trouble in the hottie department. Tamara? She was into all that magic shit. What if she really is a witch? And what if you really are a fucking moron? We messed up. That's all. She wasn't dead. All right, we've got to get to class. Like I said, I'll talk to her. Gotta get a score in this period. Set! And the pass is good... Tamara? Tamara? Somebody shut her up! Stop! Stop! Don't hurt her! Tamara, please, stop! Bitch! Tamara? ls she all right? - l can't feel a pulse. - Move! Move! She's dead, isn't she? I don't know. Am I, Roger? - Tamara? - In the flesh. But... I... How?. Do you really care how?. Aren't you just glad to se me? God, yes. Look, I'm sorry for what happened. You didn't mean for me to get hurt. - No, I swear. - Things just got out of hand. Yes. But you're okay. And that's all that matters. Do you really think I'm okay? You buried me, Roger. I'm sorry. Look, we thought that you. Do you have any idea what that was like? - No. I... - Well, let me show you. Scholarship... Scholarship... But I have a scholarship. Imagine waking up in the cold, wet ground. Scared. Alone. You don't know where you are. How you got there. You claw at the ground until your hands are bloody and raw. You try to scream, but dirt fills your mouth. And you feel the bugs and worms eating at your flesh. God. God. Make it stop! Now do you understand what I went through? All because you were too scared to stand up. God. I'm sorry. I didn't know. I guess everyone's right. You are a loser. And what would they think if they knew the whole truth? That you're such a sad little boy that you... You thought you could bleed the pain away. But it's still there, eating at you. You know what your problem is? You never finish what you start. Good afternoon, Hafton High. l know a lot of you may view me as just some loser video geek. This weekend, l did something horrible. It made me realize... you're right. I am a loser. Although l can't change the past, I can still make things right. I can accept my punishment. But first l want to offer you all a little advice. Never be afraid to stand up for what's right. Don't just sit back and allow yourself to. Hear no evil. Roger! Roger! Speak no evil. Roger! See no evil. I can't believe he killed himself. If he would have known Tamara was alive, maybe he wouldn't have. - I should've told him right away. - It's not your fault. Yes. He took the easy way out. Would you listen to yourselves? You are so busy... trying to clear your conscience, you don't get it. This is our fault. All of it. Don't be so hard on yourselves. Accidents happen. Actually, I want to thank you. Because of you, I'm not that scared, insecure girl I was. Now I know what I want. Tamara, we need to talk about what happened. We didn't know what they planned. They said it was a party. Yes, it was Patrick's idea. - Dick! It was yours. - It doesn't matter. It happened. And what we did after was inexcusable. - I don't want excuses. - What do you want? You'll see. You guys, what did she mean by that? What was that shit about it being my idea? Shut up. Maybe she just wants to forget all this. You seriously believe that? Why not? You and I were always nice to her. Yes, until we buried her in the woods. How do we even know it was really her? I mean, look at her. - What if that magic... - Don't start with that again. You know, enough! Something happened in those woods. I'm gonna find out what. Here it is. What if she's still here? She dug herself out. Why didn't she suffocate? No! No! - What is it? - She's here! - Chloe, it's empty. - I saw her. Come on, it's alright. Look. See? What is it? It's a spell. But there's so much blood, I can't make it out. See? I told you. She's a fucking witch. Dude, keep it up and I'm gonna bury you. Maybe he's right. Tamara, what are you doing here? The door was unlocked. I needed to talk to someone. - Well, Alison's at school. - I can wait. I don't think that's a good idea. Please, Mr. Natolly? I've been through so much lately. And now with Roger. Okay. She should be home soon. You know?. I've been thinking about what happened between us. Nothing happened. But, I'm sorry if I misled you. Did you? - I didn't... - Look at me, Mr. Natolly. - Look, it was a misunderstanding. - Look at me. It's getting wet. What? The table. Are you gonna drink that? So, do you like my new look? I liked you the way you were. This is me, Mr. Natolly. Not that pathetic weakling you felt sorry for. I've never felt sorry for you. And you shouldn't change to please people. I've changed because I want to be pleased. Do you have any suggestions on pleasing me, Teach? - Tamara, stop. - Do you want me to? - You should leave. - Should I? I love my wife. Well, aren't you loyal? But it's only a matter of time, Bill. I know you want me. I can see how much. Hi, Tamara. Come on in. I'm sorry I missed you last night. Don't worry. Mr. Natolly made me feel much better. I know. But let's talk about you. - You want to analyze me? - I want to know how you're doing. Roger's death came as a tremendous shock. The whole thing's got me thinking about what's really important. You know, like finding true love, having a family... You're so young. You've got your whole life ahead of you. I'm afraid to end up in my thirties... and find myself in a marriage not as happy as it used to be... worried it's my fault for I can't give my husband what he wants. And even though I like to think I'm strong... there's a small part of me that knows... there are so many hot young geris who want him. Is everything all right? Yes. I am so sorry. I think I have another appointment. - Can we finish this later? - I'd love that. In case you didn't get the moral of my story... let me spell it out for you. You'll never give Bill children. It looks like things got personal during your chats with Tamara. What are you talking about? She knows we've had trouble conceiving and I didn't tell her. Well, I certainly didn't. Then, how does she know, Bill? How are you doing? Party tomorrow night at my house, okay? Did you get a load of those two? Some of my drink specials, I'll be hot dogging them all night. - God, you're such an ass. - As long as I'm getting ass. What are you, a rabbit? Why don't you eat something and get ready to party? Thanks. But suddenly I'm not feeling very festive. You're letting that freak get to you? I'm not letting that bitch ruin my senior year. Are you with me, bro? Yes, fuck Tamara. We'll be there. Tamara! My classroom, now! Sit down! So forceful, Mr. Natolly. How'd you know about mine and Alison's personal problems? - You two are having problems? - Don't play games with me. How did you know?. What's come over you? - You have. - Stop it! What did you say to Alison? Forget about Alison. She could never give you the things I can! I have everything I want. Just leave me alone, okay? Not yet. Something is going on between Tamara and Mr. Natolly. What? I'm not pregnant. You look beautiful. Come and give me a hug. You like touching me, don't you? I just want some affection. You're my girl. We're all we've got. l can still smell her perfume. I can still smell her perfume. If you loved mom as much as you love that bottle... then maybe she wouldn't have left. And you wouldn't be chasing your own daughter, you bastard. You love that bottle, don't you? Then finish it, daddy. The whole thing. There's more in the fridge. I shouldn't drink. I'm already really buzzed. - And these are so strong. - They're my special mix. Don't worry, geris. I'm gonna take care of you. You know what I'm talking about! This is a private party. You are not invited. Really? l'm not going to jail. I'm not going to jail. l'm not going to jail. I'm not going to jail. Not yet. Get me a drink. This is messed up. Something's wrong with Patrick. She's got to be up to something. Why the hell did you bring that? The spell has something to do with how she's changed. I want to confront her with it here. There's a lot of people. Maybe she's messing with Mr. Natolly, too. I'm glad you all decided to stop by. This party should be killer. I've got to go to the bathroom. - Come with? - Sure. I don't believe this shit! What in the hell are you doing? - What did you do to him? - This. lt's five against one. It's five against one. You want me, don't you? More than all those geris you took to that cheap hotel... drugged and fucked? You know what would really turn me on? I want you to know what it's like to feel helpless... to be taken advantage of. So, who's gonna pitch and who's gonna catch? Eenie, meenie, minie, moe. Well, Patrick, it looks like you're the bottom. So, go on, Shawn. Give me a show. He went towards the bedrooms with Tamara and Patrick. What? He followed her. He was acting all weird. Like Patrick. - Kisha, wait! - No! Kisha? Shawn? Shawn, stop it! Stop! Leave him alone. You are so beautiful. I used to envy you. Your perfect body, flawless skin. But, deep down, when you look at yourself, what do you see? A girl so vain. So desperate to keep her man, she'll do anything. Does loverboy know what you did to make yourself beautiful? Does he? Actually, you're skin and bones, Kisha. You should eat more. - What happened? Are you okay? - We heard you scream. I'm starving. What happened up there? Alright. Come on, let's go. Come on. I'm calling Mr. Natolly. Why'd you want to meet him here? You're not going to tell him, are you? - Chloe? - I'm done lying. - We could go to jail. - And the alternative is better? I'm sorry, Shawn can't come to the phone. He's fucking Patrick. We're meeting Mr. Natolly. We're gonna tell him everything. - What are you doing? - Where are you meeting him? - Kisha? - You stupid... Kisha! We're not trying to hurt anyone, okay? Come here, I have a plan. Fuck! Get dressed. There's been a change of plans. She chewed them. We need to get her to a hospital. The bleeding stopped. We need to find Tamara before she comes for us. Chloe, this whole witchcraft thing is just not possible. There's no other explanation. Tamara died. And now look at her. Patrick, Shawn, and now Kisha. Roger killed himself. She's doing something to them. Okay. Let's go take a look. So, what do we do? Knock on the door and say... ''Mr. Riley, we think your daughter's a zombie witch. Can we come in? Great! Let's have tea.'' Yes. Mr. Riley? Mr. Riley, it's Bill Natolly, Tamara's English teacher. Mr. Riley? Hello? Hello? Mr. Riley? Hello? My God. Shit... It's mine. Hang on. Here it is. Shit... It's a love spell. It gives you the power to control people by touch. It says that... the blood of the person casting the spell must be spilled... for it to work. We did it. We spilled her blood. Her fade is bound to the one she loves. ''Like a phoenix from the ashes... let me rise anew to claim all that should be mine.'' The spell brought her back. It binds her fate to the one she loves. She thought she was meeting you at the motel. You're the one she wants. - She has bound her fate to you. - She knows l love... My God. Alison! Fuck! The line's dead. Bill? We did some renovations. What the fuck do you guys want? Sorry, Mrs. Natolly, but Tamara wants you dead. Oh, God! Mrs. Natolly? Your husband called us. I'll get a doctor. - What happened? - We don't know. I want you to take her to examine room 3. Cross and type her. I'll be there in a minute. Let's roll. Hi. My wife's here. Alison Natolly. - She's upstairs. Room 509. - Thank you. Family only. You'll have to wait here or in the cafeteria. Where is she? I'm sorry, sir. You can't go in there. - I'm her husband. - I need to see some ID. Thank you. Alison! Baby! They said that Tamara wanted me dead. I killed them both. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. They had this look in their eyes. A cold, soulless look. What's happening, Bill? What's happening? She's sedated. She'll be out all night. Magic? - I know it sounds crazy, but... - Can l help you, miss? - What is it? - Tamara's here. Come on. - What are you doing? - We're finding Mr. Natolly. Kisha? Come on, let's go! - Jesse, Tamara's controlling her. - I know. So, we don't want to kill her. Well, I don't think she feels the same way about us. Here. Use this instead. Alright, go hide. I'll get her. Kisha, come on. That's right. Come on. Come on. Kisha! Jesse? I'm okay. Oh, God. Jesse? Jesse? I'm gonna go and get you help, okay? - Stay with me, please. - No, Jesse! You need a doctor! Chloe, listen. You... You... - You gotta stop her, okay? - No. No, Jesse. We're gonna stop her, okay? We are. You're a good girl, Chloe. - Jesse! - I wish I told you sooner. Jesse, no! She's not gonna hurt you. I promise. Stay back! You'll never have him! He loves me! Shut up, you barren bitch! Do you know the sacrifice I made to be with you? - I died for you! - I'd die for him too. You can be sure of that. Say goodbye. It's over. Tamara really did die in that hotel. You're a monster. Nice try. Didn't you learn the last time? You can't kill me. Sweet Chloe. l'm making this my business. You guys really should give Tamara a break. This is really wrong, burying her out here like this. No... Tamara! Tamara, stop! This isn't you. It's the magic. Try and remember who you were. You can end this. Don't let it control you. God, what have I done? I've turned into them. With a touch, I could've made you mine. But I didn't want you like that, like some mindless slave. No, we can stop this. There's nothing left. No! It can't end like this. I won't let it! - Tamara, stop! - Tamara's dead. No, no! You came back for me. Unless we're together, this will never end. Our fates are bound together for as long as you live. I love you. Then, we'll be together. Forever. No! No... Their fates were bound together. He was the only one who could stop her. You're going to need stitches, but you are a very lucky girl. It wasn't luck that saved us. Push everybody back. Hurry up. l need everybody to move back.
