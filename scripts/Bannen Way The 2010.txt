My father always called me a quitter. I had to live with that my whole life. Now, you've probably got a lot of questions. Like, why is he fucked? Why is he smoking in a Nicotine Anonymous meeting? And who is that? So, that's Madison, by the way, and we'll get to her and why she's got my wallet a little later. For now, just know that I had every intention of getting out of the criminaI lifestyle. My friends in the back. We welcome you. Maybe some new friends. So I'm guessing you don't have - the 150 G's to pay Sonny. - Where's the fucking money, Bannen? That's why you're pretending like you don't see us - when we're chasing you all over the city. - Now you can beg for mercy. Not exactly, guys. Kill me if you want, but if you give me a week, I'll give you an extra 100 G's. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. I'm getting way ahead of myself here. So I should probably mention that the goons work for the notorious prison gangster Sonny Carr, who I owe a little money to. Don't let his Latin flair fooI you. He will shoot you in the face. Let me back up a bit. We got the studio loft job, hot chick that works at front desk, Mr. B trying to hunt me down. Right, this is probably a good time to bring up Mr. B and how I used to work for him before I went freelance. He's a man of many virtues. Patience isn't one of them. Anyway, I'm trying to triple my money... Right, so here we are at the beginning. I had 50 G's to my name, but I owed Sonny 150. Today. I had one last job lined up but I figured, hey, why not play a little cards, triple my money, and then pay off my debts the honorable way? In these situations, I always think of Grandpa's principles, which he liked to call the Bannen Way. Let me give you an example. I know what you're thinking, "If you owe Sonny 150,000 and you've got that in your hands, "you should probably quit. " But, hey, we're all human. I'm all in. Hey, Bannen, it's Zeke. Where the hell are you? Did you forget we have our last job today? Get down to the studio complex downtown, all right? - It's D-day, Zeke, and we're a little short. - What are you talking about? We've got two seconds flat to pull off this job and you're talking to me about short? I had kings. What was I supposed to do, fold? I'm here. Let's just visualize the game plan. All right, let's do this. When you get in the lobby, you're gonna convince the manager - to give you the key to Haskell's studio loft. - So I'm impersonating this Haskell guy? Right. Go out the back. On your left will be a building. Down the hall, and you're looking for J345. You're gonna look for a laptop on a desk. You take care of the transfer, I'll take care of the rest. Hey, Bannen, I know you said we were done working for Mr. B, but... You're seriously bringing up Mr. B right now? All right, yeah. Don't get all yelly at me. - I just thought that maybe he could help. - Not an option. Roger that. All right, we'll just focus on the studio job. Do you have your video feed glasses? And roger that. - All right, work your magic, Bannen. - Sorry. Shit. Shit! - Hello. - What happened to the regular manager? - Hi. - I seem to have lost my key. I must have left it in my... Jesus. Those eyes. - Let me just verify your info. - Okay, tell her your name is Allen Haskell. Haskell, Allen. A- L-L-E-N. Can I get a date? Of birth? - Keep your pants on, Bannen. It's 4-22-47. - Sure. -4-22-47. - You look fantastic for 60, by the way. Unfortunately, we don't have any spare keys. What? No. She's new. She doesn't know what she's talking about. But I do have the master key. No, no, no, no! That is not an option. Tell her to look in the drawer. Should I escort you myself? "No, thank you, ma'am, but if you'll just check the desk drawer... " - Tell her that, Bannen. - Okay. Okay? It's not okay! It's not okay at all! You need to focus. Please listen to me. Oh, God, Bannen, we have a job to do. You're going to blow this whole job. You will not engage with this girI. Okay, all right, now that she's let you in, you will say, "Thank you and good day," but you will not engage! All right, just listen to me, NeaI Bannen. All right? We have a job to do. Do not, I repeat, do not... Oh, God. He engaged. Hey. Okay, Bannen... Bannen, I need you to focus right now. Find the laptop. We have a small window of time here. I have some quick business to do. Oh, God. One second, one second. - Dude, get in here. - Go! Get out! Get out! Bannen, thank you, thank you, thank you. Okay, go to the accounts folder. That's it. That's it right there. Now, set up the transfer to the externaI and I'll take care of the rest, all right? - Looks like there's two more accounts. - No, no, no. No other accounts, Bannen. There's only one unsecured. All right? We don't have time for other accounts. I don't care. Let's do it. Bannen, how about this? Get the 100,000. All right, Bannen, remember what your grandfather used to say, "A winner knows when to quit, a loser quits too early or too late," as in quit having sex now! All right, if you go for more than one account, they're gonna freeze all three and we're gonna wind up with nothing. Shit! Haskell just entered the building. Bannen, I need to know if we're going after the one account. We're just going after the one account. - Yeah. - Yeah! Is that a "yeah" to me on the one account or to the girl? - Yes! - Okay. Now, B, get out of there now! He's walking down the hall! He's walking down the hall! Please, please get out of there right now, all right? This isn't funny, man. Get out of there right now! Please get out! Go, go, go! - Yes! - Yeah! - Dirty boy! - Yeah! Allen! Transfer is complete. On both our ends. Thanks, bro. Biggest pimp ever. Hey, Neal. Get in. Your uncle wants to talk to you. When a mob guy probes you for answers, you gotta watch what you say. When he's your uncle, well, same deaI, just slightly more uncomfortable. I understand you've gotten yourself in a bit of trouble with Sonny. - Nothing I can't handle. - Manni, have Veronica join us. Drink? Yeah, the old falling off the wagon thing. I've never seen this shot with you and my folks. Happier times. Now, you should know this. As a rule, I don't go to anybody. I make them come to me. That was another one of Granddad's principles. So next time I call, answer the goddamn phone. I'm better with texting. Your charm has really run out, though, with your friend Sonny. If it was up to him, you'd be floating in the river. What do you owe him? Would $250,000 cover it? How about 500? Let's just make it the American dream. $1,000,000. Neal Bannen, millionaire. I'm offering you a chance to square your debt. Maybe a little place in the Bahamas, fancy cars, women. - Or whatever you want. I don't care. - Sounds intriguing. Suffice it to say, that box is a valuable piece of merchandise. Yeah, I think I saw one of these at Ikea. Yeah, The Mensch. Though he is heavily guarded, he will not be expecting someone like you. Wait. Hold up. You want me to steal the box from The Mensch? The Mensch was a former rabbi who later found a home in the Jewish mob. And he also got into the sex trade biz. I'm not only the president... And he wasn't much of a mensch. How you procure the box is entirely up to you. That was your grandfather's. His father gave it to him after the war. My father gave it to me when he realized he was dying. And now... Yeah, I'm not really a gun-toting kind of thief. You will be. You know what I like about you, Neal? Even when you're in a position where you have no choice, you convince yourself that you do. No. No! I'm not giving you the 100,000. - You're just gonna blow it... - Come on. ...on another card game, okay? Just not until we get the whole amount for Sonny. Now, this job that Mr. B wants us to do looks right up your alley. All right? Check it out. The Mensch is having one of his mail-order bride galas in a couple of days at one of his storage facilities. Even if I'm going to do this job, which I'm not, I need more than you jerking off behind your computer. - Okay, first of all... - And that's when I met Madison. Dude, this is gonna be so cake sauce. Look... It's just gonna be a bunch of rich d-bags and hot Russian broads walking around, looking to get some action. A million dollars. $1,000,000. Sorry. Bannen, you're just gonna stop walking when I'm right in the middle of making an important executive decision? I gotta grab something out of my car. I'll catch up with you. All right. I'll just go over all of this on my own. I'm sorry. You okay? What? Always be the summoner, never the summoned. Don't do it, Bannen. You're breaking the rule. Excuse me, sir, ever heard of a crosswalk? - Hey. - Can I see some ID? It wouldn't happen to be in any of those three wallets, would it? - No, I just... - Yeah, okay. - Why don't you just step over to the side... - Oh, my God... Back again. Did you miss us? Tell us what to do here, Neal. - Where the fuck is he? - Interrogation. - Which one? - B. So here we are. Third strike, no more outs. Just months after you told me you were gonna be a better man. If you're convicted, that's life in prison. No more fancy cars, fancy clothes, women, just you in an orange jumpsuit pitching nickels against the wall with a bunch of homeboys who are going to take a deep-seated interest in your last name. You two take a walk. I want a private conversation with my son. Yeah, this is my dad's version of quality time. I know about the money you owe Sonny Carr. And I know about your dealings with my brother. The D.A. wants you convicted, locked up, key thrown away. She wants to set an example for the precinct, and I'm not totally opposed to that idea. But... I can make her cut you a deal. Total immunity. That perked up your ears, didn't it, huh? Keep your virgin ass out of the state pen. It's what your granddad would call appealing to a man's self-serving greed. Let me guess. You want me to turn states on Mr. B? It's your last chance, kiddo. Hey, Dad? My father always called me a quitter. I had to live with that my whole life. It wasn't until the day he died... After posting baiI, I'm back to square one. Broke and screwed. Third strike, no more outs. I understand you've gotten yourself in a bit of trouble with Sonny. Taking no action means 25 years in prison. I'm offering you a chance to square your debt. ...your virgin ass out of the state pen. Or I could turn states on Mr. B, which means having to look over my shoulder forever. And I know about your dealings with my brother. $1,000,000. Or I could work for Mr. B, pay off my debts, and run from the police my whole life. Even when you're in a position where you have no choice, you convince yourself that you do. It was decision time. Kill me if you want, but if you give me a week, I'll get you an extra 100 G's. Not for Sonny, for you. Just, you know, tell him you couldn't find me. When in need, appeaI to greed. What if we said we want 200 G's? Well, Finch, I guess I say okay. Come on, man. Where you gonna find that kind of money? Mr. B hired me to do a job, retrieve a box that somebody stole from him. Word on the street says there's something pretty special in that box. Tony was telling me about it the other day. It's a mask of some sort. I mean, it's worth a lot of money. All right, so I'll get you guys your money. In good faith, I'll let Cujo back there take a shot. You, Bannen, you got yourself one week. Francis. Nice. So we're good, right? Uncle B was right. I don't have a choice. You've got a choice. Grow up or give up. That's your advice? I thought you were supposed to be supportive. I guess next time I'll just ask God for advice. God's a little busy to worry about you. You gotta believe in yourself. Go with your gut. And don't take all of this too seriously, 'cause it'll bite you in the ass. Thanks, Mom. You always know what to say. Are you aware that breaking and entering is a felony? The use of a gun can increase the sentence to state prison. Well, I'll be sure to only use it in self-defense, then. Based on what I've seen, I think you could use a bodyguard. Unless you're applying for the job, I'll assume you're stalking me, which gives me quite a case against you. Oh, no, actually, I just dropped by to give this back to you. I was mildly impressed. No one has ever lifted from me before. I kept your Starbucks card for my trouble. Sure. Press charges, break the code of thieves and, yeah, have my Starbucks card. Did you just say "code of thieves"? You highly overestimate your charm, and you're definitely underestimating my trigger finger, - so I feel like I should sneak out now. - Without hearing my business proposition? Your business proposition? See, I was thinking maybe you were tracking me because you find me attractive, but clearly you're just using me for my more roguish qualities. A deft hand can be very attractive. I feel like I should tell you things about myself, like I never commit to anyone or anything, ever. I have trust issues. My daddy didn't love me. If you want to offer me a job, you should make it the best damn offer possible because, Mr. Bannen, no matter how enchanting you think you are, people get one chance with me, and if you screw up that chance, you may never see me again. Face-to-face, anyway. The job is to steal something that means a lot to one scumbag and deliver it to another scumbag. Your salary for this job is a couple hundred thousand, and it may or may not include benefits. And it's gonna be very dangerous, I'm not gonna lie, not to somebody like you. You'd sniff that out 100 yards away. My fee is actually 500 grand, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna do the job. Spoken like a true pro. That was straight out of the book. Whatever you pledge allegiance to owns you. Lesson learned. How's your father doing? He doesn't know I'm working for you again, if that's what you mean. - You haven't seen him? - No, why? He's watching me. I hope for his sake he keeps his distance. Not to worry, though. Your allegiance is in the right place. I can't even open this frigging thing. It's supposed to have the Turin Shroud in it. You know, that shmate Jesus was buried with? Could someone please open this fucking box for me? What is that? Wait, wait. What is that? A frigging power tool? Have you ever heard of the Sabbath? Have you ever heard of a Jew? Do you know what a Jew is, Mr. Shnook? Today is Saturday. It's the Sabbath. You can't use electricity on the Sabbath. How was I to know? Look, I'm sorry. Power tool. You're a shmuck, Shnook. What? Mr. B is sending somebody over for the box. Find him. I want him dead! You didn't have to sleep in my car. So I'm gonna take this job on one condition. I call the shots. No. There's Zeke. He's my right-hand man. Hey, buddy, you ready for prep day? So ready. I just took the biggest deuce you've ever seen. I feel, like, five pounds lighter. I almost sent you a picture of it. Zeke, you're in the car with Madison, the one I was telling you about. - She's kindly gonna help us on this job. - We'll always have this moment, Zeke. Nice to meet you, too, Madison. Okay, on to more pressing matters. Apparently, The Mensch has found out that Mr. B sent you after the box and has hired an assassin trio for protection. These are the hottest assassins I have ever seen. - Perfect. - The first one I call Jailbait. I believe she's in her 20s, but she says she's 17, because perverts seem to get off on that kind of thing. She seduces her victims, she lets them have their way with her, she waits for the opportune time, and then she stabs them with a horse tranquilizer. I'm not even gonna get into what she does after that. And then the next one is former speciaI ops, trained in acrobatics, martiaI arts and espionage. And she loves knives. I call her Stiletto. And last, but certainly not least, the one I named Bombshell. Really not much to say about Bombshell. She's hot, she's blonde, she likes to blow shit up. Bannen, listen to me. I'm sending you the images. Look at them this time, okay? Why is that funny? There's no such thing as a trio of hot assassins. In my wildest fantasies, maybe. - I'm saying let me drive once. - No. You don't know how to drive your own car. What are we... What are we doing? We have to go see my uncle before we do the job. I'm sorry. We have to make a quick stop to see your mob uncle? There are certain people, Bannen, who I would like to remain anonymous to, like everyone. He's the one paying the bills right now, so... Wait a second, I just realized, - after I pay Sonny and his guys... - Who's that? - ... and Zeke gets his cut... - Bannen! ...and then you get your cut, I'm left with nothing. Bannen! Always good to see you, bud. I know we told you we were gonna give you a little more time, but sorry, man, you were summoned. - Who in the fuck is this pretty boy? - It's Neal Bannen. - No, it's not. - What do you mean? What do you mean what do I mean? This ain't Neal Bannen. All due respect, Sonny, we've been trailing that piece of shit for weeks. With all due respect, I'm telling you, this ain't Neal Bannen, because Neal Bannen swore he was gonna have my fucking money by now. Can we talk as two cutty macks? I could've sworn you owed me 150 G's, huh? But every time my gentlemen catch up with you, you have nothing. Now I ain't never been no college cat. I mean, my teachers was macks, hustlers, pimps. You see, I didn't use a pen or a pad. I used three-card Marley, loaded dice, and loaded guns. I think I get where you're going... Now, I want to ask you, do you hold grudges? Because I do. When I hold on to a grudge for too long, man, I start to see red, and then there's only one thing that keeps me out of the red. Box! And then I'm nice and smooth again. Then I start to remind myself, "Isn't Neal Bannen retrieving some sort of valuable box for Mr. B?" He is. He totally is! And I hear that it's got a set of these thick, flawless diamonds inside of it. - Isn't that right? - I heard an antique mask. Diamonds! Then it's clear to me. Instead of taking the money, I'll take the box. You dig? - Papi! - I dig. You're playing my favorite song. Neal Bannen? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Mami, you two know each other? Come on, Papi, let's dance. Catalina. Normally I would kill a man for crossing that line, but we agreed, you're gonna bring me the box, so I can't do that. I see you brought your little lady friend with you. I think I found a way to reciprocate. - Okay. - Okay, ya pues. What are you doing? Sonny, what are you doing? You know, you're right, Sonny. I did sleep with your girl. Before you guys were together, of course. It's only fair, though, that you have your way with her. What? Okay, you know what, Sonny? Come on. Come on! Stop! - What are you doing? - Come on. Come on. Come on. I should probably warn you, though, as a cutty, she may not be very clean. I mean, when a girl sleeps with as many guys as she does, she's bound to have something. Are you saying you brought a hooker up in here? I didn't know she was a prostitute when I first met her. When I picked her up for our little date, first thing she said was, "$5 for a handjob. " I mean, I should've known. Look at the way she's dressed, those "fuck me" boots. - Mami, is he telling the truth? - I'm not a prostitute. I'm a high-class call girl. And I'm $50 for a handjob. $50. Thanks for looking out for a cutty, man. Jesus! Thanks, guys. - I think I'm falling in love. - Don't. I'll only hurt you. Are you two ready for this? We'll have the box by tonight. Neal? Just so you know, Manni doesn't work for me anymore. From now on it's Dimitri or me. You trust this girl? Why wouldn't I? All right. Word to the wise from your favorite uncle. Don't fuck this up. No turning back now. Hey, B, we just got the invite. - You going over the guest list? - Yeah, I think I got my guy. All right, while you're doing that, we'll finish the replica box. All right. I'll tie up the rest of the loose ends. Replica complete. All right, let's make sure we're on the same page. I'm going to arrive as J.C. Trilby. - I'll already be there. - And I'll mingle for a bit. Before you meet up, you both need to mark each of the guards with transponders so I can track them. There's eight of them. And I'm gonna mark The Mensch. - We meet up and flirt for a while. - Yeah. By that time, everyone should be nice and toasty, so you can head to one of the rooms. The Mensch's private room should be guarded. - Go to the next room over. - I'll hand you the replica. Bannen will make his way through The Mensch's secret doorway to get to his private room. The box should be hidden in a hollowed bust. Switch it out with the replica and you're good. Wait, wait, B, you never told me how you're gonna pose as J.C. Trilby. I can't reveal all my secrets. Hey, Madison should be on the rooftop. She couldn't wait. She marked all the guards. She only has The Mensch left. Let's party. Okay, Madison, just get him interested in you, but don't be too aggressive. You don't wanna scare him off. - Hello. - I've been eyeing you all night. Okay, change of plans. Just go for it. - It's so nice to finally meet The Mensch. - I know. Okay, find your opportunity and mark him. That sounded just nasty. We are in. All right, Madison, make your way over to the bar. - Let's get this over with. - Bannen will pick you up there. Making my move on Madison. Fuck off, bitch! You will make a fine wife. Why don't we go inside and we make it official? How are you still single? - We got to make this believable. - How do you propose we do that? Okay, but just to make it believable. Hey, hey, hey. How you doing, huh? Mister... - Trilby. J.C. Trilby. Yes. Yes. - Trilby, Trilby. That's great. You know, I think, Mr. Trilby, you better beat it. This one's mine, okay? Looks like The Mensch might be in love. I think she's got him. - What's going on? - We're about to find out. How could you still be single? Maybe you should come to my room. I'll suck your fingers, I'll suck your toes, and then you can... ...suck mine. Hey, go with it. He's gonna lead you right to the box. - Let's go. - Come on. You may not be needed, Bannen. What do you say we check out one of those private rooms? Sure. Hey, you want to join us? Come on. Okay, Madison, the box should be in the corner... Not bad, huh? ...under a hollowed bust. Do what you gotta do. - Why is... What's he doing here? - This is Mr. Shnook. He's privy to all my business. He's fine. He's good. I think we should do it now. Come here. Could you just... Could you just... The things that I would like to do to you, I don't think you're gonna want Shnook to see. Mr. Shnook, please leave the room. And lock the door behind you. Beat it! Pervert! Why don't you guys make yourself comfortable? You know, entertain each other. - What the hell is going on with Madison? - Hold on. - She's not responding. - What do you mean? Madison? Madison, do you read me? What? - She's gone. - What do you mean "she's gone"? She just disappeared. She's completely off the radar and The Mensch isn't moving at all. What the fuck is going on? I'm going in there. I'm gonna just... I'll be right back. You guys just keep doing what you're doing. God, I could marry both of you. This is spooky, B. Be careful. Something's not right. Where'd she go? Trilby, thank God it's you. That sock was disgusting. - Tell me where she went! - Wait a minute. Wait a minute! You're not J.C. Trilby. You're that prick Bannen! Shit, Bannen, get out! - You're after the fucking box, right? - Go to the window. You fucker! Shnook! Get your fucking ass in here! Shnook! - What's happening, B? - Shnook! - I'm in the dark here, B. What's going on? - Get in here! Shnook! What are you doing, B? You're surrounded. Get out of there! It wasn't untiI precisely this moment that I believed the assassin trio even existed. I hate being wrong. Finally, finally, the assassin has arrived. You're dead, Bannen. You're dead! I want you to fucking cut him into little pieces. I want you to slice his liver! Go, go, go, go, go. Go! Come on, hurry! Come on! Come on! - Bannen, what is happening? - Zeke, Madison has the box. She's off the radar, Bannen. She turned off her cell phone, I can't find her on the satellite. I can't call Mr. B and tell him I lost it. You gotta find her. Just find her! So what are you gonna do? - Sorry, is this iced tea? - Yeah, Long Island. Wait. Happy holidays. Okay, gentlemen, a big round of applause for Tammy, everybody. Tammy. All right, gentlemen, tonight is amateur night. Some lucky lady is gonna walk out of here with 500 bucks. Any takers? $500, ladies, $500. Easy money, easy money, easy money. Come on, $500. Come onto the stage. Amateur ladies, report to the stage. Going once, going twice... Whoa! Okay, who do we have here? Wait a second. Hold on a second. Steve? Steve? You sure this girI's the legaI age for this club? Let's not waste any more time, then. Yeah! Well... I think this little lady's got quite a future. What do you guys think? I thought this was amateur night. Something tells me you're not what you seem. How old are you really? - Old enough. - Are you sure? Quick lesson. You want someone to do what you want, you need to choose the options for them. I especially like to use this principle when picking up women. I have an idea. Why don't we go back to your place - and you can find out how old I really am? - But this time, it was being used on me. Or we can go to a motel and you can do whatever you want to me. And I didn't care. Zeke, dude, have you seen two girls and a bullwhip? - No, I have no wish to... - Check this out. - Look, look. Watch, watch, watch. - Get off my computer. - Just lookit. - Don't touch that. - What did you just hit? - Here we go again. Hey, guys! Guys, come check this out. - That's Jailbait. - Yeah, she is. No, you don't... Hold on. Bannen? Bannen? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? No, no, no, no. She's gonna kill him, okay? That's what she does. Okay. She's gonna stab him and she's gonna cut off his balls. All right? Bannen! Wake up! Okay, this might... Oh, God, please work, please work. Okay. Okay. Bannen, Jailbait's trying to kill you! - What? What? - She is going to cut off your balls! Jailbait's trying to kill me? For the record, I helped you save him. You tell him that. You tell him what I did here today. Hey, B, I found Madison, all right? She turned her phone back on. - Where is she? - I traced her call to a guy named Marcel. - Send me her location. I'll get her. - Keep your eye out for Bombshell. - Hey. - I am so sorry. That is so weird, 'cause I was just looking for you at the party. Right, because I had to slip out. - I missed you. - Yeah, I wanted to say goodbye and I said, "Fuck it, I'm just gonna jump out the window. " - Yeah. I wanted to say bye to you. - No, that was you. - I have to go. - Wait, wait, wait. Can't we just have, like, one straightforward conversation? - Give up yet? - Give me the box. You want the box? Hey, you know what? I have an offer for you. I know a guy. He's actually interested in purchasing my box. He's got a new connection in France, so we can split the profits 80I20. - Let me guess, you get 80, I get 20. - Yes, genius. All right, 70I30. Yeah, I'm not here to make a deal with you, all right? Okay, 60I40. That's my last offer. I'm the only one who knows how to get a hold of Marcel. Now think about it, Bannen. I don't need you or your contact, I just need the box, so just hand it over. Okay, you're right. You don't need me. I guess I'm out of options, so... Come get it. Wow. Holy shit. - That was nice. - That's pretty far. I really, really wish you wouldn't make me do this. I think I like you. Let me tell you what's gonna happen. - Okay. - All right? I'm gonna walk over and you're gonna hand me the box. I'm gonna walk away and I'm gonna give it to Mr. B, who's gonna pay me my money so I can pay off Sonny. You want to shoot me sometime in between, so be it, 'cause I don't have a choice. Okay, 50I50. Stay away from him. I wish I could see your face when it happens. If I see your blonde fucking bimbo weave again, I will end you. What am I supposed to do with this? Return to Mr. B and then turn states on him? He'd kill me. If I don't, I go to jail. And the fucked up thing is all I can think about - is that drink at the strip club. - Well, you made a mistake. At some point, you got to let it go and move on. Little voices in your head, those instinct voices, - what are they telling you? - Run. Spoken like a true hero. That's how I know I raised you right. The only advice I can give you is trust that whatever you decide is the right choice. Whatever I decide is the right choice. Uncle B, I got the box. I knew I could count on you. We'll meet in the afternoon. I got a warehouse in the fishing district. Come alone. Wait, Manni's been a cop the whole fucking time? Yep. What the hell are they gonna do with me if they find out I'm wearing a wire? Probably shoot you. I'm kidding. It's gonna be fine. All you gotta do is make sure that you get in there and deliver the box and get him talking. Okay? If anything goes wrong, and I'm sure it won't, - we'll cut the lights and move in. - Anything happens, you hit the floor. - Let us be your guardian angel. - I thought that was Mom's role. What would she think of all this? All set. All right, let's rock and roll. This is fucking bullshit, Zeke. I'm doing the biggest drop-off of my life and you're not even there to wish me good luck? Whatever, dude. Fuck off. I'll call you later. All right, you're gonna waltz in as your charming self. Everything is normal. Sure, just doing a drop-off to my mob uncle, who I'm about to rat out in front of his armed henchmen. - You know, typical day for Neal Bannen. - Or you can go to jail. Choice is yours. Unit A arriving and getting into position. Let's move. You're gonna frisk my own nephew? If I know Neal, he didn't bring the gun. He's not wearing a wire. Why would he be wearing a wire? You're not wearing a wire, are you? All right, boys, grab him, tie him up, slit his throat. And then we're gonna take his balls and cut them off and throw them to the sharks! Watch out, boys, here comes the fuzz. Unit B, what's your 20? Now, Neal, I'm very excited you found the box. May I see it? Hans, get him his money. Remember, you're not gonna just drop off the box and walk out. You have to get him talking. You gonna tell me what's in the box before I give it back? Your future. You passed, Neal. I wanted to see if you would follow through with your promise. Are you saying this is some sort of test? Come on. The Mensch? His trio of assassins? The Mensch was a test of my patience, that is for sure. The assassins, however, generally, they're freelance. Their services go to the highest bidder. They tried to kill me. They had to appear to be your adversaries. But, really, they were meant to be your guides. You've gotta get him to talk. Get a clean statement now. Wait a second. What about Madison? She ran off with the box. How'd you know I'd find her? No way. You trust this girl? I saw her on the street that day. I found her. How silly of me to assume that a man with your sexual appetite would spot a beautiful woman and instinctively follow. Like I said, you passed the test. NeaI, make the drop-off and get out. We have got nothing unless you get a clean statement. Do it now. I said you could have everything. The money, power, the women. What if I told you everything was yours? The keys to the kingdom, Neal. Everything your grandfather dreamed was possible. And everything your mother threw away. Neal, do not listen to him. Get out. I trusted your allegiance was in the right place. You didn't disappoint me. You earned this. Now go pay Sonny and we'll talk further. What, are you gonna make my arm fall off? Come get your money. NeaI, what the hell is going on? Talk to me. Now you know where my allegiance lies. - Cut the lights now! Cut the lights now! - Go, go, go, go! Neal! It's okay! Look, you had a momentary lapse of judgment, but I'm an understanding guy. They got nothing on me. No harm done. I got your money. We can still get out of here. Neal. I'm dying. You're my last chance to make a meaningful contribution to this world. I'm asking for you and me not to be enemies. Nicholas! Don't you fucking move. Stay right fucking there. Yeah, only one missing from this little reunion. - Son, get out of here. - Your mother, Neal. - Come with me, you'll know everything. - That is not a suggestion, it's an order. Go ahead. We'll meet next week for coffee. Looks like I win, Nick. Your little reign of terror is over. What could you possibly find so amusing? This reminds me of when we were kids. I used to shoot pigeons out back. - Pigeons? - Captain, what's your 10-20? Rats from the sky. I'm around back. I'll hold him till you get here. They shit everywhere. They terrorized the cat. They stole birdseed from the cardinals and the gold finches, the noble birds. You came out back one day and objected to my action. Yeah, I broke your fucking nose. I'm behind the warehouse, standing by. Dad came out. He saw my nose bloodied, shattered. But he warned you, one of these days I'd grow up and you wouldn't be able to pick on me anymore. And you said... You'll never be as big as me. Right. Nick, stop fucking around. Don't do this. Come on, Zeke, pick up. Pick up. For some reason, you've always been known as the guy who did what he thought was right. I guess that's how you got to be where you are. And I will always be known as the guy who was willing to do what the other guy wasn't. God damn you. Zeke? No, I'm looking for Zeke. Do you know where he is? Hey, Bannen, look, I know you're doing the drop-off right now and I'm maybe being paranoid, but the guy I saw, the other guys, like big guys snooping around... So I thought maybe you could... Hold on. Hold on. No! No, no! No! Bannen! Don't worry, guys. I'll get him back somehow. Can we help, Bannen? Mr. Bannen? I am good with guns. I've got, like, a 98% headshot kill ratio. - Hello? - Be cool, all right? Be cool. Thank you. Dr. Travis, you have a visitor in the main lobby. - I don't want to hear "I'm sorry. " - I wasn't going to say I'm sorry. Code of thieves, huh? You know, you should actually appreciate the fact that I took a job and followed through with it. You, on the other hand, you just had to screw up my deal with Mr. B, didn't you? You know what my favorite thing was? This was my favorite. Unbutton, unbutton, unbutton. You're so dramatic. You owe me money, Bannen. - I owe you money? - Yes. 500 grand. That's up from the $5 for a handjob. - You think that's funny? - Yeah. That was a freebie. You're gonna slap me? You're gonna have to let go of one of them if you want another handjob. Yeah? You know how fucked I am right now? Zeke's been kidnapped, my dad's been shot by my uncle, and it's probably my fault. So today's arguably the worst day of my life. And for some reason, all I can think about... Yeah, well, don't be fooled now, because all I want is my money. Yeah? Prove it. - It's Jim, one of Sonny's guys. - Mr. B is calling me. Sonny's got Zeke. He's threatening to kill him unless we bring him the box. Mr. B knows we're together. He said we can keep the box. He just wants you to meet him at Inspiration Point. I'm not meeting him at Inspiration Point. I'm doing this alone. I don't want you getting hurt. Bannen, I'm going with you. Look, Sonny. The box. No games. I just want the kid. I don't want any trouble. I want to be done with all this. - Francis, untie the kid. - What? That's it? Hold on. How do I open it? Nobody knows how to open the box. You like to fuck with me, don't you? You're always finding new ways to fuck with me. Did you enjoy fucking my girl? Catalina? You're like a connoisseur of fucking with my life. And for some reason, you're still alive. Yeah. - How in the fuck does he get away with that? - I'm fucked. You shoot pool? Shoot some motherfucking pool. I'm Sonny Carr, and I'm gonna watch you take a bullet in your gut. I want to see how charming you are then when the bullet enters your body but doesn't blow out your back, so you fight the urge to squirm. I'm gonna wipe that pretty, charming boy smile off your dying motherfucking face! I cannot let you fuck with me anymore, pretty boy. You're dying right here on this motherfucking pool table. Eight ball, corner pocket. Give me my gun! Give me my gun! Mami, what are you doing with papi's gun? Shoot him, Mami. Go ahead, mama. No. Shoot him, mama. Give me... Give papi the gun, mama. Look, I'll make it up to you. I didn't mean to hurt you. Mama, it's loaded. Give me the gun. Mama, we'll make love, sweet love. Give me the gun. Tell me, mama... Francis! Francis? You all right? Stupid bitch. Fucking waste. Who's the fucking man now, Sonny, huh? Who's in charge now, huh? Who's in charge now, right? I never liked that guy. Fuck. Out of bullets. I guess today's your lucky day. Thanks. You good? Yeah. I mean, I was thinking about starting my own business anyway. I could still use that 200 G's. Little Tommy needs some braces. - Right. - Go on, get out of here. I'm sure I'll catch up with you sooner or later. Bannen. Let's just say you owe me one. You look like shit. I am so proud of you. The D.A. says we haven't got enough on my brother. I'll plead on your behalf. For 60 years that prick's wanted to shoot me, but he'd never, never break his golden rule. Always covers his tracks. Uses his fall guys to take out his trash. - Dimitri shot you? - Yeah. And unless Nicholas admits guilt, we may never get him. - Hey, hey, hey. - Jesus. Dad, just relax. He keeps bringing up Mom. I mean, what did he mean at the warehouse when he said, "Everything your mother threw away"? It's time you heard this from me. I haven't told you the truth because I tried to protect you. It's not gonna change what happened. - It's not gonna change what he did. - What did he do? I was afraid of what you would do. I was afraid of what he might do to you. I loved her so much. - I swear, there was nothing I could do. - Sir? - She loved you from the bottom of her heart. - Sir, I'm gonna need you to leave. She... She would never do anything to hurt you. - Sir, please, leave. - I swear to God, she loved you. Okay. Yep. Okay, thanks. Hey, all right, so I just spoke to Marcel. He's in France. He still wants the box. We need to hop on an airplane. What's going on? What are you doing? What happened? I'm going to Inspiration Point. Bannen, we'll sell the box. You're finally gonna start over. I don't care about the box anymore. Okay. If you leave, I won't be here when you get back. Tell me about my mother. Neal Bannen Jr. Pointing a gun. Did you ever think you'd see the day? Tell me what you did to her. That gun you're holding, that was your grandfather's, you know that. Cut the shit. I'm clean. It's just you and me here. I want the truth. What happened to her? When two men, brothers, love a woman the way we loved her... What happened to her was an accident. Facts. Go. - You were a kid. - Yes. - She had a car accident. - Yes. I was driving that car. I was having an affair with your mother, Neal. On and off, since before you were born. - What are you telling me? - He was drinking. He was in a blind rage. Are you trying to tell me that you're my dad? We kept up the facade as long as possible. Your mother's choice. He was suspicious. He followed us one day in his car. He tried to run us off the road. It worked. The car flipped. Me and him, we blamed each other, but for the first time in years, we agreed to cover it up. For your sake. I'm gonna tell you something here in a minute that's gonna upset you. Very much so. And then I'm going to sit right there, and you're gonna execute me for what I did. Now when you do, everything I own will be yours. It may take you a while to realize, but this is what you were meant to do, Neal. I don't want it. - That's why I put you through this. - But I don't care. I don't want it. I'm not going to let you piss away this opportunity. But I don't want it! You apparently missed the memo that says, "I'm trying to get out of this lifestyle. " This whole wild goose chase that you put me on to find this stupid box? I have a theory. I think you created the box so you could draw out your enemies. You knew if you created enough lore surrounding it that nobody could resist, and eventually they'd all get killed. The Mensch. Sonny. So what's really in the box? I mean, everybody's got their theories. Ancient masks, diamonds or whatever. But you and I know it doesn't matter. And then it hit me. Nothing. Nothing in the box. How poetic to think that everything that everybody wants, whatever their little greedy minds come up with, that's what's in the box. Brilliant. You wonder why I want you to be my successor? God, I wish I'd thought of that. But... ...no. Unfortunately, I did put a little something in that box. And your girlfriend's gonna be the first one to find out. God, I see so much of your mother in her. I could tell right away you'd met your match with her. She was a big asset to me when I needed her, but now she's... She's getting in the way. Neal Bannen's answering service. Now, you may hate me at first, but you're gonna have to trust me when I tell you that she'd only be a distraction to you. - Hello? - She'll appear to be loyaI. Did you really think I'd leave without you? Is this Madison? I promise you, she won't be there when you get back. Let's do this. I'm sorry. It's just too perfect. We made a replica box. For The Mensch job? It was because I was so tired of the real box that I had to get rid of it. So on my way to visit my father at the hospital, I dropped the reaI box off at your office. You just blew up your own building. Well done. But you're gonna come around, Neal. My blood courses through your veins. You're capable of so much more. You proved it tonight by coming here to kill me. Let's do it. Yeah? Like I said, I'm not really a gun-toting kind of thief. They got nothing on me. Just you and me, right? They got nothing on me. You're probably right. Zeke, please tell me you got that. - Every word. - Got you. Sometimes a man has to make up his own set of rules, so I added a new one to the Bannen list. Don't let other people determine what you should and should not do. - Nice car. - Thank you. - Where'd you get it? - Just test-driving. ripped by genrules
