Please turn your cell phones off so we don't get interrupted. Possession of drugs and paraphernalia is not permitted for security reasons. I turn it over to our secretary. Thank you, Soren. Welcome. I am an addict and my name is Rune. We have a tradition to celebrate clean time... which is total abstinence from all drugs. Is anyone on their first clean day? - I'm Benny and I'm an addict. - Hi, Benny. Welcome. - From 1 to 29 days? - I'm Milo and I'm an addict. I'm on my fifth day. Are there any months or years to celebrate? My name is Linda and I'm an addict. I'm celebrating one year today. Congratulations. I will send key chains... and a coin around to you, Linda. Let's fill them with lots of love and power. Thank you. It's time for sharing. You can share about whatever is on your mind. My name is Milo and I'm an addict. So I'm back again. I feel that it's time I pull myself together... because it's my daughter's birthday today. She's turning 25. And I have promised to cook for 45 people today. So I've got a lot to do. It's important to me that we have a really great party. I just have to remember not to take that first drug... then everything will be okay. But... I hope I don't slip up this time. This time I'm going to stay clean. Nothing. Zip. It's got to be there somewhere. Where haven't we looked? The spare tire? There's nothing here. I'll take a look here. There's nothing, goddamn it. - Well? - No. I'm positive. This is bullshit. Let's check the engine. I just want to see if... Let's check the air filter. That's too stupid. The air filter! They are not total idiots. Bingo! The filter! Good. - We're running late. - I know. Hurry up. - They used coffee. - Can you believe it? Coffee. Well? What's that? It's ecstasy. - Ecstasy? - Yeah. - Are you sure? - Well, it ain't vitamin pills. Fuck them. What the hell do I do with it? - We should have gotten dope. - There's no dope in town. Fuck it. Pack it up, let's go. Hurry up. How are you, little Milena, my beautiful girl? - You're late. - It's Swiss, it makes good time. Happy birthday. - Mike, how are you? - I'm fine. Peter! My father is here. - Hi. I'm Peter. - Milo. Father. Wait. I'd like to go over everything again. It's 11 o'clock, and we have to get everything ready by 5. - We went through it all yesterday. - We're gonna do it again. - What do you want to know? - Just answer yes or no. - Wine glasses and water glasses? - We have everything you need. - Tablecloths? - Listen, Milena... You are not my only customers. - Okay, what else? - Flowers. - You never mentioned flowers. - I am now. - How many? - I want a bouquet there, there... ...there and there. And I want a bouquet on every table in here. A bouquet on every table. Anything else? - Balloons. - Not balloons. - Is it a child's birthday party? - It's my party and I want balloons. - What colors? - Red, blue and white. We'll bring the guests over here for a before dinner drink. - And we'll eat around 7 o'clock. - Okay. The food has to be ready by 5. My father will be ready with the food at 5. Don't be late. - And you pick it up. - We pick up the food. - Relax. - The food has to be ready on time. Make sure there's flowers and balloons everywhere. - Anything else? - No, you can go now. Isn't there something we need to take care of? Thank you. - There's only 10,000. - So? That was the original agreement. What about the flowers and balloons? - It's enough. - Wait a minute... It's enough! Thank you. Be here at 6. - When? - At 6. In your best suit. - You promise? - Yes. Your wish is my command. - Mike... - See you, Milo. Hurry up. We're late. Hi. Can we talk? Shut the door. Where is my? Wait. Rexho! Get in here. - What is it? - Tell me what this guy is saying. - What's the problem? - What problem? Luan doesn't understand Macedonian. Then explain it in Albanian. There was ecstasy in the car. No dope. I'm positive. There was ecstasy in the car instead of heroin. So can't he just sell it? - Can't you just sell it? - I don't want it. I need dope. He needs heroin. - I need dope! - Calm down. I don't know anything about ecstasy. I lose business if I don't have dope. You understand? He doesn't know the difference between ecstasy and vitamin pills. You're trying to fuck me over. Take it easy, Milo. It was just a misunderstanding. - What should I say to him? - Wait, I need to call someone. - Find out what happened. - What's going on? Luan is calling Holland for a status. - What? - Status. About what's happened. Don't stress out, Milo. Relax. It's dangerous for an old man like you to get all stressed out. - We're going out, right? - Of course. - When will you get a nice shirt? - You don't like it? Hugo Boss. Hugo Buga, not Hugo Boss. - Chinese Hugo Boss. - I don't know what happened. They must have gotten the cars mixed up in Holland. - What happened? - Tell him about the cars. The truth. There's a new car on it's way with heroin. In the meantime you can leave the ecstasy pills here. - Or you can hold on to them. - I'll hold on to them. - He's keeping the pills. - Then he can try to sell them. - Can't you sell them? - How much? How much should he pay for them? - 10 kroner a pop. - Are you sure? Yeah. Milo, 13 kroner. Everyone else pays 15. I don't know... You can sell them for 15-20 kroner. It's easy money. But remember: The car has to go back with the money from the ecstasy. It's 11 o'clock. Can you make it? Hey, it's Muhammed! - Hi. Taste good? - Welcome. - Are you hungry? - No, thanks. I need to talk to Milo. Milo? Milo! - The little turk wants to talk to you. - Muhammed. And this sarma you made... Nobody likes it. - What's wrong? - They're big and cold. - The meat is raw. - Your dick is raw. What's with you? He says we got to eat it. - Are you busy? - Real busy, Muhammed. I got something for you. You can keep that. Wait a second. Here you go. I had extra expenses. - It's my daughter's birthday... - And I have to pick up the tab. Fuck that. - What are you doing? - What do you mean? Don't you trust me? We're friends. Here's some headcheese. Now leave me alone. You want some? You'll love it. Listen, some money's missing. Friends don't screw each other. - Shit! - What the fuck are you doing? I'll clean it up later. - We need a new agreement. - A new agreement? Why? You just sit on your ass. Take it easy! - We need a new agreement. - Do you want more money? - Of course. - Okay, we can talk about it. But not now. Because I'm fucking busy! I'm cooking for 50 people. We're having a party and I need a haircut. - When then? - What? - When can we talk about it? - Let me think about it. Fine, but from now on we split fifty-fifty. You're laughing? You're getting old. If you want to survive, you have to deal with the new generation. The new generation? Who's that? Me. Who else? The king of Copenhagen. The king of Copenhagen? So what do you say? We outnumber you. Listen... Do you know anything about ecstasy? Why? Because I have a lot I'm trying to sell. - I thought you only sold dope. - I'm trying out a new market. You know... New generation, new market. Funny... Are you interested? - How much are we talking about? - 10,000 pills. But they have to be sold today. - What's the hurry? - They have to be sold real fast. - How much? - What do you mean? How much per pill? - What? 7 kroner? - 17. I have no idea what you're saying. - 7 kroner sounded fine. - 17. Seventeen. That's too much. Little Muhammed... There's a lot of people I have to help. Family... - So does everyone else. - That's why we're talking about it. Shall we say 15? - For Christ's sake... - Come on. Okay. Let's do it. - Partners? - Yeah, what do you think? - What happened? - Nothing. Everything's fine. - Anything wrong? - No. - Where are you going? - To get my hair cut. - Branko! - I'm coming. Help me with this. Are you getting a modern haircut? - A modern haircut like Beckham. - Who? The football player. Have you seen his hair? - He has a mohawk. - You're bullshitting me. Sell ecstasy with a Beckham-haircut, then you're the man. Let me see you. Yeah, you look good. - I look okay? - Yeah. Great. See you later, boys. - Call me if you need me. - Okay. ...it's possible to get clean. It wasn't until I started coming here... and saw people who had been clean for many years... that I started to believe it was possible. It was incredible. I am one of the lucky ones. I could easily have died. So I'm going to keep coming to these meetings. I'm not going back to where I was. I'm really glad to be here today. Thanks. My name is Milo and I'm an addict. So I made it to the meeting. Thanks for sharing. I must say, I'm a little jealous. Because my life is really chaotic. It's my daughter's birthday and I'm cooking for 50 people... and it's not going very well. People in my line of work are really stressing me out. They're making the process difficult for me. That's when I start thinking: If I use, it will make it a little easier. Or my fellow workers come and ask: "Do you want a line?" But I say no. I don't give in. And I hope I make it through the day. I'll see you again tomorrow. Thanks. We will now hear the 12 traditions and pass the hat around. Hi, my name is Angelo and I'm an addict. "The twelve traditions of N. A:" ...and the serenity prayer. Everyone helps clean up. Take your cups with you. God. Grant me serenity to accept the things I can not change... courage to change the things I can... and wisdom to know the difference. Keep coming back! Muhammed, my little friend! King Kong of Copenhagen. The king of Copenhagen. - Where is my Djokica? - What Djokica? - Djorde Marijanovich. Where is it? - No one listens to that anymore. - It's there among the old records. - I listen to it, you peasants! Are we gonna talk? This isn't a social call. We can talk now. Of course. - I have found a buyer. - Oh? Who is it? A guy from Aarhus. - We only have an hour. - How much? He wants all of it. All the pills. Good. Branko... Branko doesn't need to know. I can take care of it. You need Branko. We'll do it like we usually do. Branko! - Branko, come here. - I got an upset stomach. - You go with the little Turk. - Can't you find someone else? Derikonja, you go with him. I can't do anything. Your sarma poisoned me. What's wrong with my sarma? The others have left. Branko has been on the can for a half hour. Have you been eating shawarma? We have to wait. He's sick. Wait? The guy is leaving in an hour. This is our big chance. Don't ruin it for us. You have to trust me. You need someone like me to survive. What's up with you? You look sick. - What does he want? - What's wrong? My stomach hurts. Some kind of infection. - He has a stomach infection. - What? Stomach infection! A stomach ache. You understand? I understand Danish, but you don't. You shouldn't eat Milo's food. What's wrong with my Danish? I speak perfect Danish. Whatever. So what's your plan? You don't have to turn your back on me. - You can go with us. - No, I have to pick up the wine. - It's my daughter's birthday. - Pick up wine? What the fuck? We have a big deal going down. Give me the stuff. I'll be back in two hours. Okay. That's cool. Be back here in one hour. - Yeah. - But listen... Be back in one hour. And call me as soon as the deal is done. I said yes. Look at that guy. He's totally fucked up! No one can make money for him. I'm the only one, and he still has an attitude. What's up? Here... It's okay. - One hour! - Two hours. Not one. A couple of hours. I'll do it as fast as I can. Branko, damn it. What's going on with you? Branko, hurry up. I need you. - Branko... - Can't someone else do it? - I can't pick up the wine alone. - Find someone else. Look at me. - What was the Turk saying? - Fuck him. - Derikonja, get up. - I'm not capable of anything. I can't carry the wine. Come on. - Hurry up! - My stomach hurts. What's wrong with you guys? Come on! Use your fucking brain. Who's gonna open the gate? I shit my pants. Get out of the car, goddamn it. Come on, get out! - You and your sarma. - Fuck you! Get out. Who's gonna open the fucking gate? Idiot. - Hi. - Hi, Milo. - Shall we? - Let's do it. Wait here. - What are you doing here? - Why? Do you know him? Yeah. Lots of good wine. - Serbian brandy. - I'll take it all... Muhammed, my friend. You should have been here four hours ago. We had an agreement. Call Milo. Fuck. Are you having a good time? Make yourselves at home. - Good evening! - How are you? - Dad! - How is uncle Jova? - Was it his appendix? - Yeah, really bad. Is he okay now? Take good care of him. I'll call. Come here, dad. They're taking pictures. - Zora, is that you? Look at her. - Dad, you're too old for that. - What a bombshell. What a blouse. - Take it easy. Move closer. You too, Mike. Smile. - You look good, dad. - Yeah, I'm decked out. Mike, come here. - What were you doing at Dani's? - I was buying a car radio. How much do you make? I know you deal dope. How much does Milena know? Good evening! Silkeborg is not far. Not for you. She knows I drive a cab and I deal a little ecstasy. - You know anything about ecstasy? - Need some help? No. Listen, you don't need to deal dope. I've told you, I'll pay for everything. Everything! That's the problem. Milena gets everything she wants. I want to support my own family. I'm the man in the house. Okay. But on one condition. From now on you only buy dope from me. No... - You think it's funny? - No. Remember: Only from me. No one else. - Remember: Only from me. - Okay. Give me the Klekovaca. Djoka, this is real aquavit. Excuse me. Something else is on the way. What are you doing? Don't throw it out. - What's going on? - Please leave. You're throwing the sarma out. Why? - They may be bad. - It's not chicken from a supermarket. I don't know. Branko got sick. Why are you giving me a hard time? I just threw out the sarma. Okay? I'm sorry. Take it easy. Go back, the guests are waiting for you. - What are the guests going to eat? - Don't worry about it. Go on. - Where are you going? - Relax. Go in and take care of your guests. Hi. I'd like 60 spring rolls. Sold out? To go or eat here? - What? - To go or eat here? - To go? - Yeah, to go. Pay now. I'll wait. Is that Milo sitting there? Long time no see. What are you doing here? - What's up, Kurt the Cunt? - Oh, you'll shake my hand now? - Can you see a change? - No. There's hair on the Cunt now. Not all over, but just a little. - The Cunt with hair. - I just came back from Norway. It wasn't a skiing trip. But there was plenty of snow. Do you want some? - No. - Just a little snort? Nope. Oh, that's right. You've been saved. - Are you clean? - Clean. That's great. You look like you're sweating. - Are the fish ready? - Almost. - You're doing alright? - Yeah, everything's cool. Well, well, well... - You don't want cocaine. - No. But some... ...heroin. - No. - You say no, but you mean yes. - No. - Enjoy. Take care. I'll see you, Kurt the Cunt. - Are the fish ready? - In a minute. Milena! Yeah, we're coming. What is it, dad? - Here it is. - What? - I took care of it. - What is that? - Fish. - What are we going to do with it? Eat it. The guests are already eating. You're late. Get rid of it. Throw it out! - Throw the fish out? - Yes. Hurry up. The guests are waiting. Let me see you. Come on. Goki! Miki! Are we having a good time? Let's have some fun tonight. He's kissing everyone. You have everything you need? Just let me know. Are you drinking? Is this for me? - A toast. - Cheers! Take a hike, honey. Little Muhammed has something of mine. - What's the problem? - I need to talk to him. I'll pass it on. Anything else? - Call me. - Yeah. See you. A toast for little Milena! Come in here. Let's have a toast for Milena. Come on. I'm not very good at speeches, but I'll give it a try. On this happy occasion I have to brag a little about my Milena. I have taken care of her all my life. Even in the worst of times when she lost her mother. Milena. I was the first person you saw when you were born. It was the happiest moment of my life. I remember everything. Every image. Every little detail. It's all still in my heart. Even after all these years, Milena. It's still in my heart. At that moment I said to myself: Anything you ever wanted you would get. And that you could always count on me. I hope that has come true. Today I say goodbye to a little girl... ...and hello to a young woman who has found her own path in life. I wish you well in your career as a nurse. We are all proud of that. And in your future life with Mike. But fortunately I can tell you all... that I have had my first serious talk with Mike today as a father-in-law. And we have business plans, so that joins us all together. At this joyful moment I have a little gift. Two tickets on business class to Bogota in Colombia. And... One month in a five star hotel. So the young people can discover new cultures... see the world... and look towards the future. - Milena, I wish you the very best. - Thank you. - Say thank you. - Mike, good luck. Congratulations. A toast for Milena! What's the problem? He wants more time to pay for the ecstasy. - What is it? - I'm under a lot of pressure. Everything's going too fast. - What's he saying? - I think he's stalling for time. Tell him to come back with the pills. - Bring the pills back. - I don't have them. He has sold the pills but doesn't have the money. It's a Bulgari. I'll give it to you as security. He says it's worth 70,000. As a security. It's a nice watch. But it's only worth 5,000 to me. - He'll give you 5,000 for it. - Listen, it costs 70,000. It's only worth 5,000 to me. - Okay? - Yeah. It's not our problem that you don't have the money, Milo. The car has to have either pills or money. Okay. We can figure out a solution together. He wants us to find a solution. If I'm gonna solve his problem he's gotta solve mine. If we're gonna solve your problem you have to solve one for us. - That's a possibility. - He's in. Listen, we don't usually do this, but since it's you... we suggest a partnership. Thanks, my friend. But make sure we get our money fast. - Right. - Good. - What now? - My daughter is having a party. - You have to solve our problem. - It's my daughter's birthday. - I have to go back. - Wait in your club. I'll see you later. - Hi, Milo. - Hi. Is anybody here? - What? - Are you alone? Yes. Where's the package? She's the package. This won't take long. Can I get some beers and a coke for the cunt? No. Your ass is to fat. Would you like a diet coke? - You understand Polish? - Yes, I speak Polish. - Make us some food later. - What are you talking about? - Milo, you work for us. - I work for nobody. Should we call Luan? Listen, Milo. We help you. Now you work for us. And this is only the beginning. Ice! Do you have ice? For the beer. Relax, we'll get along. Let her in. - Who is it? - Don't worry about it. Open the door! Don't fall asleep. - Hi, honey. - Hi. - Welcome. - Thanks. Milo! Milo! Bring me a coke. - Coke or diet coke? - Coke. What do you think? I think she looks pretty tense. He didn't get it. - When's your birthday? - Today. Today? Really? - What a coincidence. - It sure is. So what's the price? Walk back and forth. And make it look good. Come on. One more time. One more time. Back and forth, god damn it. Okay. Wait in the corner. That's about 60,000. Thanks for doing the math, but it's 45,000. Whatever. I'm not interested. Not at all. - What? She's a professional. - Take a look. She's scared shitless. - You think so? - Yes, I do. I'm not interested. Hey! Say that you love to fuck in English. You can't be serious. I'm out of here. Hey, just a moment... One moment! Cocksucker. - Where's the beer? - Try the fridge. Will you make us some food? I don't have any. - What do you mean? - Everything's at the birthday party. Your daughter's? Then go get some! - Hi. - Hi, Peter. Everything okay? Do you need anything? - No. - Good. Shit! So this is where you're hiding. I've been looking all over for you. - Yes, I'm organizing things. - Where are you taking that? - I'm helping those who starve. - Is anything wrong? What do you mean? Everything's fine. How's the party? Are people happy? - Great. - Are you happy? Are they dancing? Don't you have something to tell me? What do you want me to say? Wasn't my speech good? Don't you have something to tell me about Mike? Mike? What about him? - He says he's going to deal for you. - Says who? You should have told me. We just agreed on it today. You can see how busy I am. - What's his cut? - What? Don't give me that! Mike isn't too bright. - Tell me, what's his cut? - 180, that's standard. What? 140 per gram? I wanna make some money. 140. Listen, I'll settle that with Mike. He knows the price is 180. Fuck him! I want it for 140. If not, I'll find another dealer. That shouldn't be too hard. - Is that so? - That's how it's gonna be. I'd like to see you try. Milena, when did we ever talk like this? What happened? - Why are we talking like this? - You started it. Leave me alone. I don't want to talk about it. Listen. We can distribute a lot of dope through his cab company. Accept it. Otherwise you'll lose some good business. Okay. 160. Okay. - Are you sure you don't need help? - Yes, everything's fine. Hurry up and come back to the party. - Pera Drekavac wants to see you. - Pera Drekavac is here? Milo! Milo! Milo, you dumb fuck! Clear the table. - You don't like the pork roast? - Are you kidding me? Halal-meat, is it? Whoops, I forgot to check. Next time don't forget. Aren't you hungry? It's her birthday. How considerate. Watch out. You're gonna get fat. Have you got coffee? Make some coffee. I'm going out. - And the others? - They're staying. I'll be right back. Give him some dope. - Do you smoke heroin? - Yeah. Give me that. - Yes, cocaine. You want some? - Yeah. - Speed! - Polish. What's the matter? Son of a bitch! Fucking speed. Polish speed. Get back here! You whore! Where are you going? Where were you going? Your mine! I'll kill you! Get out of here! She's my cunt. Or I'm gonna fuck you up! I told you to watch her! Fuck off! Leave her alone. I'm gonna kill you! Easy now. It doesn't hurt that much. Take it easy. Calm down! Relax. Easy. Go, go, go... - Stop crying! - My passport. Go! Damn! Fucking speed! What the fuck took you so long? Where's the Polack? Yeah? In two minutes? Okay. No, don't come in here. I'll meet you outside. Okay. Two minutes. What's up? - It's little Muhammed. - I can see that. - How much? - What do you think? - Fifteen. - Twenty. He was hard to find. But on one condition: Don't hurt him. What do you mean? He's my friend. I don't know what he's done. But if anything happens... We'll come after you. Relax. I just want to talk to him. Of course. But keep your gun in its holster. Listen, my friend. You can trust me. Take him into the yard and I'll give him a ride. Hi, Milo, what a surprise. How are you? I haven't seen you in years. I don't believe it. You really shined the place up. Have you seen my motto? "We're satisfied when you're satisfied." - Sounds good to me. - Want a drink? - Tonic water. - I didn't expect to see you. It a total surprise. - It's Milena's birthday today. - Today? How old is she now? - 25. - Congratulations. My son starts in high school this year. - You're kidding. High school? - That's right. Look at us... Time flies. So... What brings you here after all these years, Milo? What is it? - I've got a problem. - A problem? What kind of problem? A big problem. What about Branko? - He's sick. - Sick? What do you mean? - I don't know. A stomach ache. - He's been eating your food. - What did you make for him? - Sarma. But that's not it... I knew it was you. Listen... I need your help more than ever. Milo. Look at this place. Look at me. I'm out of all that now. Understand? It's over. For the first time in 20 years I'm a happy man. It's not that I don't want to help you. But I can't afford to let anyone drag me down again. Ever. Radovan, my friend. You're the only one I've got. Listen, I'll help you out this one time. But don't ever ask for my help again. For old times' sake and never again. I knew you wouldn't let me down. - Who the hell is that? - That's King Kong of Copenhagen. - King Kong, huh? - Let's get him inside. Close the door. What happened to my ecstasy? - What ecstasy? - The pills you sold seven hours ago. - Where's the money? - You never gave me ecstasy. - Maybe it was my cousin. - Are you playing the hero? Are you here too, dickhead? He shouldn't have said that. - So you like to play the hero? - Do see any heroes here? Tell him exactly what he wants to know. Why don't you ask him? He knows more than I do. You gave me fucking candy, man! Not ecstasy. What do you expect? Did you rob a candy store? You made me look like an asshole! Why are you lying to me? - I gave you two bags of ecstasy. - It was two bags of candy. You're fucking me. He's fucking me. - Are you sure? - He's the one who screwed me. Listen... Do you know who I am? I don't give a fuck. Milo, this is crazy. Let me go! What's the bag for? You'll see, my friend. Milo! What now, hero? You want to tell us something? Is there anything you'd like to tell us? - What happened? - What do you mean? - Is everything okay? - What? Nothing's wrong. Where the hell is the bottle-opener? - Milo, I'm not fucking with you. - Then why didn't you call me? You can't give me 10,000 gumdrops and expect me to call. Fucking bottle opener. - Where's my money? Where is it? - There is no money. Listen, this is the last time... No, no! I got some in my pocket. Why don't you try one? - Here? - Yeah. No, are you crazy? Give it to the pig. - Swallow it. - Give him a handful to make sure. It's candy. - Is he in a coma? - I dunno. Ask him. - Do you feel anything? - No, nothing. - Maybe we have a problem here. - A problem? Yes, a big problem. - You've been fucked big time. - Maybe. I didn't know... Are you proud of yourself? You old junkie! Shut up! Don't you ever call me a junkie. I said I was sorry. - Let me go, or else... - Or else what? - You don't want to know. - What was that? - You're asking for it. - For what? For what? Don't you fuck with me! You wanna fuck with me? So you wanna fuck with me! Put him in here so he can't fuck with me. - Hold him. - Fucking faggots! This will teach him. Once and for all. Now what? - Who's that? - A Polack. Milo, for God's sake, how many? You said there was only one. - And who is this then? - An Albanian. That's okay. Anybody else? Don't kid around. Let's get these down. What are you doing? Are you out of your mind? - I need a watch. - Don't take it. How can you do that? Listen, let's move the tables first. We'll move the tables. How solid would you say that thing is? - What? - The pipe up there. It's solid enough. Okay. I'll tell you what... Have you got any aprons? Get some aprons. I also need plastic sheets and some gloves. That's a must. - Right. - And move that. It's in the way. Let's get to work. Put the apron on and we'll see what we can do. Take the apron. The apron. Get the plastic. Here... Right here. The plastic has to be right under this spot, okay? Put the gloves on. Remember: Don't ever do anything without gloves. Get a grip. - Move them over there. - That way? Yes, half a yard so the middle is right there. - Fuck! This guy ain't finished. - I'll get him. - He's still alive! - I'm coming. Give me a hand. Lift him up. Take his clothes off. You do the top half. Remember that thing, the winch? - What? - Do you still have that winch? - Yeah. Want some of this? - No way. I would never touch it.

Listen, have you something big, like a bathtub? - A tub of some kind? - Yes, so we can... - Here. He's all yours. - No, you've done pigs before. - You've slaughtered pigs before. - Where's the tub? Good. Put it there. Christ, it stinks. It's fucking disgusting. That's it. Empty the tub and bring it back. Let's finish this. Fuck... What a smell. Take it away and get rid of it. Milo! - What? - Do you have a saw? - What? - A saw. Over there. Behind the bar. - Milo! - What is it now? Where do I find a power socket? Are you listening? - Where do I find a socket? - Right over there. Dad? Hi. - So you're home. - Yeah. - Where have you been? - What? Where have you been? You know, I've been busy. Coffee? Please. - How was the party? - Great. As if mom had been there. Don't smoke in here. - Aren't you having coffee? - No, I'm going back to bed. Good night. In Danish it's "good morning". Good morning.
