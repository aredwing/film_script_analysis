And if I were you, no more cognac. We'll come for you at five. It'd give you three hours. You will be here. I don't mind so much being killed. But you know how hard it is for me to get up in the morning. Good night. Good night. I'm afraid this time, Stefan has picked a fight with the wrong man I wonder if he'll be here when we come back? Who is it? Brand. Good morning, Mr. Brand. Cheer up, John. This is one engagement that I have no intention of keeping. Honor is a luxury, only gentlemen can afford. Pack my things... Whatever you think that I'll need for an indefinite stay. I have a cab downstairs... In about an hour, I'll go out the back way. I'm sorry. I won't be here to see their faces. Did this come during the night? Would you bring me some coffee... with cognac? "By the time you read this letter, I may be dead." "I have so much to tell you, perhaps very little time." "Will I ever send it?" "I don't know." "I must find the strength to write, now before it's too late." "And as I write, it may become clear that what happened to us" "...had its own reason beyond our poor understanding." "If this reaches you..." "You'll know how I became yours..." "When you didn't know who I was, or even that I existed." "I think everyone has two birthdays. The day of his physical birth..." "... and the beginning of his conscious life." "Nothing is vivid... or really my memory." "Before that day in spring..." "When I came home from school," "And found a moving van in front of our building." "I wondered about our new neighbour..." "Who owned such beautiful things." Lisa! Come in, Lisa! Come in this minute, did you hear? Lisa! Yes, mother. Who is going to clean that up? Me. I suppose. I haven't enough to do. You better get another rope. Uh? You better get another rope. Alright! Get another rope! This is the last time I move a musician. Why does he have to play the piano? Where do these go? What? In the study. Thank you. Lisa, what are you doing out there? Come inside. "I didn't see you that day, or from many days there after." "But I could listen to your playing." I wish he'd stop that noise. It's not noise. Don't bite my head off. Mr. Brand is playing. You called that playing? Shh... How old is he? Who? Him! Quite old, I guess. Oh. You know the boy I was talking to outside the school? The bony one with the yellow hair and the long nose. One who lives next to the grocery. I'm gonna do something about it... If he doesn keep his hands to himself. These things he does, right out in the street. Thank you, John. I'll be home later. Thank you. Good morning. Why, Lisa! You're all red in the face. You're blushing! I'll get you for that! "Yes, I was blushing." "And hard as it may be for you to realize..." "From that moment on, I was in love with you." "Quite consciously, I was preparing myself for you." "I kept my clothes neater, so you wouldn't be ashamed of me." Bow, two three four... "I went to dancing school." "I wanted to become more graceful, and learn good manners for you." Bow... two three, and one two three... And one two three... "So I would know more about you, and your world..." "I went to the library..." "And study the lifes of great musicians of the past." "Though I was not able to go to your concerts," "I found ways of sharing in your success." "As months went by, I began to know your friends." "Many of them are women. Most of them." Lisa! Lisa! Where are you, Lisa? Aren't you going to finish your dinner? Sorry, mother. "But I really lived for those evenings when you're alone." "And I pretended that you're playing just for me." "I know you didn't know it..." "You're giving me some of the happiest hours of my life." "Then came a great day for me." "In the building where we lived..." "... Thursday was rug-beating day." Come on, let's help him! Oh! I've got to do my own. I'll do it for you afterwards. Come on! Remember what you've promised! I will. Beautiful rug. It's a beautiful rug, isn't it? Oh, it's just a rug. Oh, you wouldn't know. Say, what are we doing this for? Shh! He will hear you. Oh, he can't talk. Well, he can hear, can't he? You're welcome. Come on, Lisa. I'll be right down. What are you going to do? Go away, I'll be right down. What are you going to do? Go away, or I'll throw you downstairs. Are you crazy? Lisa! What are you doing up there? Come dear, I've something to tell you. It's really good news. If you think about it sensibly, you'll be very very happy. Sit down. I can understand that you must've been startled... When you saw Herr Kastner and me in the hall. Perhaps it's my fault for not telling you something about it before... You see, dear, your mother is not really old. She can have admirers, too. She can even... well, be in love with a man. Someday you'll understand better what that means. You know how hard it is for us to get along on my small pension. Herr Kastner has a comfortable business in Linz. A military tailor. And he's done me the honor of asking to marry him. Besides, he is a kind man, and he likes you very much. I'm sure with his help, it'll be much easier for you to... Mother! What is it? Would we have to go to Linz? Would we have to live there? But why not? What is there to keep us here? I won't go! I won't go! Lisa! What's the matter? But... what is it? Lisa! I won't go. I won't go. Now Lisa! Do be reasonable and tell your mother. I won't! I won't! Lisa! Let see... We've eleven altogether. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. It comes, Dear. Don't worry, dear. I'll take care of everything. The adjustment promised the trunk said that... Oh, either I'd lost half a minute... or the station parts ahead. How much would that be, please? It's up to you, sir. Up to me? One dollar should be enough. The guy promised the trunk would be here on time. With all the boxes... One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Uh... how long will it take if we send them through Linz third class? Two weeks, maybe. Two weeks... very good. Now each of these... second class. Third class... Each of these... third class. Yes... Ah... what did I tell you. When you're going to a thing, do it one time. That is always nice. Hello. Thank you. You can unload it here. Our train doesn't leave until 12:00. Yes, 12:00, darling. The twelve! Please don't get excited, dear. I'd be calm. "Suddenly I knew I couldn't live without you." "I didn't know what I had in mind, or..." "...what my parents would do when they found me missing." "All I wanted was to see you once more." "To throw myself at your feet, cling to you, and never leave you." "Nothing else. Nothing else mattered." Alright, alright. Oh, it's you, Lisa. I thought by now that you're half way to Linz? Didn't your train leave in about... I forgot something. "These rooms where I'd lived, have been filled with your music." "Now they were empty." "Would they ever come to life again?" "Would I?" "Only you could answer." "So, I waited." "Waited..." "For what seemed endless hours I sat outside your door..." "Try to keep myself awake." "...afraid that I might fall asleep and miss you." "Then..." Who is it? Brand! Good morning, Mr. Brand. "And so, there was nothing left for me." "I went to Linz." "You who have always lived so freely..." "Have you any idea what life's like in a little garrison town?" "I was eighteen now..." "And was expected to take my place in society." Come now, Lisa. Don't look down at your feet. Please be tactful and let him do the talking. But not all the talking. Do you hear me, Lisa? Good morning, Colonel. Good morning, Colonel. Good morning. Mrs. Kastner, Miss Kastner. Mr. Kastner. May I have the honor to present you my nephew... Lt. Leopold von Kaltnegger. I have the honor to kiss your hand. Very pleased to make your acquaintance. Thank you, Lieutenant. Mr. Kastner, I have the honor, Sir. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance. Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you. Allow me to present our daughter, Lisa. Lt. Leopold von Kaltnegger. Good morning... Excuse me. Do you like it here in Linz? Quiet well. It must seemed very restfull after living in Vienna? I liked Vienna. Indeed. What did you like about it? Perhaps you were fond of the music? Yes. We also have good music here. Every other Saturday afternoon they gave a concert on the Kursalon. Oh, really? Perhaps someday you'll allow me the honor to escorting you? Very nice of you. When I was a cadet, I took part of myself. I played second trumpet. Oh, how nice. I must say I'm glad we both like music. You see there's nothing wrong with a child if she only meets the right people Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! "The Lieutenant was right." "Linz was a musical town." "So twice a month that summer we listened..." "The Lieutenant and I." Before the afternoon is over, I'm sure we'll hear an announcement Nothing could please us more, Colonel. Is that right, my dear? Miss Lisa, this is a subject which I wish to bring up for some time I trust you'd forgive me to presume the action that I allow myself... It maybe unnecessary to mention that... Ever since you first came to my attention, I've been most favourably impressed. Thank you. And I believe that your parents are not opposed... ...my keeping company that is dedicated with you. But, Lieutenant, I... Oh, please allow me to finish. As far as my prospects are concerned, you must be aware that... It's generally believed by my uncle and others, That I have qualifications for an outstanding military career. It's no doubt of that. Naturally, it's too soon to discuss any definite steps. We should know each other for a reasonable time... But, Lieutenant... I'm sorry, it's impossible. It's impossible? Please allow me to explain. I must insist. Is there someone else? Yes. I'm engaged to be married. Engaged to be married? I should've told you before, but I didn't realize how... But all the time you've been in Linz, I haven't seen anyone's company. He doesn't live in Linz. He lives in Vienna. In Vienna? He... he writes music, he's a musician. But how can that be? Your mother and father, they gave my uncle the encouragement... They don't know yet! You're engaged to a man, and your parents don't even know him? Um... I'm sorry, I... Then, please. Waiter, the wine. The wine. Up! Up! But I don't understand. Lisa, sit down. What happened? Nothing. But you must've said something. What did you say to him? I only told him the truth. The truth! What do you mean the truth? What did you say to him? I told him, I wasn't free. What...? "My poor parents, for them this was the end." "For me, it was a new beginning." "Vienna, when I saw it again," "seemed to have taken on a new splendour." "All the time I've been away," "I thought longingly, it's your city." "Now, it was our city." "Madam Spitzer's where I found work." "It's the kind of establishment where one learns many things." Miss Lisa, please. Coming. Hold your breath. Miss Lisa, we're waiting. Very pretty. Yes. Very. Very charming. Very charming, indeed. Do you think... She is not like the others, I don't understand that girl... But every evening, As soon as these shutters are closed, off she goes straight home. Really? "Madam Spitzer spoke the truth." "I was not like the others." "Nobody waited for me." "Off I went, not home..." "But to the only place that it ever seemed home to me." "Night after night, I returned to the same spot." "But you never noticed me... until one evening." I've seen you before, few nights ago. Right here. Or... you live near here? No. You like to listen to the street singers? Um... yes. Neither do I. I should introduce myself. No. I know who you are. I suppose sooner or later, we have to decide where we're walk I have something I should call off. I'd never get to the place where I start out for, anyway. Pardon. Excuse me. Very charming. Thank you. Anything else I can do for you, Mr. Brand? Will you please tell Bowlish, I won't be at the rehearsal this evening. Congratulations. Fritz, is that gentleman free now? Just moment, sir. Don't you see I'm busy with Mr. Brand? Now... how about Lily? If she comes, how am I going to tell her? Well, tell her... I'll tell her... It was most important and you had to work. Yes, that's it. That's fine. I'm sure she will understand. I'm sure. Thank you. Bye. Stefan, I missed you yesterday. I have to talk with you. Later. I saw the ? group at the conerto. It's a young man I met... His father owns half of the... I thought it was something for one of your concerts. If you just go outside... I'll talk to you tomorrow. Tomorrow... Now, don't be frightened. If it's not to becoming, the lobster would have no intention. I was wrong. It is becoming. Let's see, when do they have lobster again? Friday. How about Friday? A week is a long time. How about Wednesday. That's pheasant. They have pheasant on Monday. Could you possibly make it on Monday? I've no engagement at all. I've none, either. We'll have dinner tomorrow night. Wiener Schnitzel. Excuse me, Mr. Brand. The lady in the next room, If I'm not mistaken, it's The Countess Newesky. Would you sign her the program of this afternoon's concert? Certainly. She said, Mozart himself could not have done better. How nice of her. There you are. Thank the Countess for the compliment. Thank you, Mr. Braun. The note is not the least she deserves. Four years ago when you played the D Minor. You remember that? The morning review, also. Compare too young Mozart. I was very young. You like it? Valpolicelli, it's called. First thing you see when you come down the other side of the Alps. The Italians say, it is such a good wine, Because the grapes have their roots in the valley, And their eyes on the mountains. Please... Please what? Please talk about yourself. I believe you really want to hear about me. Why? Uh, never mind why. The truth is, I've had rather an easy time of it. People accepted my music very quickly. Perhaps too quickly. Sometimes it's easier to please others than oneself. What're you going to say? You know you don't talk very much. Well... I can't say it very well. But... Yes. Sometimes, I felt when you're playing that... Go on. That... you haven't quite found what you're looking for. How long have you been hiding in my piano? Uh, never mind explaining. I just assume you're a sorceress, And that you can make yourself very tiny. It might be a good thing to have a sorceress for a friend. Who knows? You maybe able to help me someday. How could I help you? So, that's what you've been thinking? You're a very strange girl. Who ever you are, where ever you came from... Don't you have any problems? Not... important ones. It's been a long while since anyone did that for me? Stop here, please. Woo... Ah. Good evening, Mr. Brand. Good evening. Roses? Yes. Please. Nice red ones? No. Red is the wrong color. I think a single white rose would be perfect. This is a special occasion. Here you are. Good night. Good night, Mr. Brand. Enjoy yourself. Did I guess right? Is it your flower? From now on it will be. Would you like me to close it? No. Hah... and now to the park. Do you think it would all be close? I hope not. I never come here in the season. It's more pleasant in the winter. I don't know why. It's perhaps... Because you prefer to imagine how it will be in the spring. Because if it's spring, then it's nothing to imagine and to wish for. Is there anything about me you don't know? A few things. For instance, one thing I don't know, If one day they would make a wax figure of you and put you in there. Because you'll be so famous. Well, if they do, will you pay your penny to come in and see me? If you come alive. Now I see you as a little girl. You do? When my father was alive, we travelled a lot. He went nearly everywhere. We've had a wonderful time. I didn't know you travelled so much. Oh, yes. Perhaps we've been in some of the same places. No, I don't think so. Where did you go? Well, it was a long time. But... For instance, there was Rio de Janeiro. Beautiful, exotic, real with its botanical garden. Its Avenue palms, Sugarloaf fountain, And the harbour where you can look down and see the flying fishes... We're in Venice. Yes, we've arrived. Where would you like to go next? France? England? Russia? Switzerland. Switzerland. Excuse me a moment while I talk with the engineer. You and the lady, are you enjoying the trip? Very much. We're off to Switzerland. There you go. Thank you. Oh... thank you. Switzerland. Switzerland. Switzerland. So, you're looking down at the flying fish. Then what? Aren't you going to finish the trip? Well, there weren't any trips, do you mind? You see, my father had a friend in the travel bureau. My father worked across the street. He was an assistant super attendant of the municipal water? And he used to bring photos home with pictures in them. And in the evening, he'd put on his travelling coat. That's what he called it, 'Cause I was very young. And he'd say: where should we go this evening? And I would say: Vera Cruz. Because it's a beautiful name. And then he would say: um... it's summer there, You don't want to roast like a coffee bean, do you? So, you never did get there? No. It's just like I tripped the land with the midnight sun. What stopped you this time? The weather. I thought of India. But then father remembered it was the raining season. Your father was an expert on climates. My mother used to say that... He knew what the weather was everywhere except home. What mountain was that? That's the Matterhorn. You've climbed it? Um hum. Tell me when you've climbed up the mountain, what then? Well, you come down again. Tell me more about your father. Well, then he finally did go away. He had the nicest eyes. Yes, I can see them. Why do you like to climb mountains? Well, I suppose because, No matter how high you climb, there's always a higher one. And you like to imagine that the other one is even more wonderful. Like the spring in the park. You know far too much about me already, And I know almost nothing about you Except you have travelled a great deal. End of the line. All change. All change. What now? Where haven't we been? We have no more countries left. Then we'll begin all over again. There you are. Thank you. We'll revisit the scenes of your youth. I don't know about them but I'm going home. Right after this number. Me too, if he is not paying me 50 quarters. I'd like to play for married people. They've got homes. You're sorceress. Now I'm sure, how else could we dance this way. Unless we've danced together before. And yet if we had, should I remember it. Please. Promise me something. Anything. But I don't even know where you live. Promise me you won't vanish. I won't be the one who vanishes. We're here. Thank you. Thank you. Who is it? Brand. Good morning, Mr. Brand. Please be seated. Lisa, leave it on. Someone wants to see it. Oh. Real customer. Looks like a good one. One moment. You'll like this one, I'm sure. I'm sure. I like it very much. Very much. How did you find me? I'm a good detective, what you think? You are. I'm afraid we have to put off our play for tonight. I couldn't go away without seeing you. Where are you going? Milano. The whole orchestra is going. We go to play at L'escala. It's wonderful. I've forgotten all about it. It won't be long. Just two weeks. The train leaves at 5:30. Do you suppose you could see me off? I'll try. I'll look for you then. Good bye. Thank you. Good-bye. You will be there. How did it go? He wasn't interested in the suit. But... Madam, could I leave a bit earlier today? How early? About 5:00. Yes. Sure. Thank you, Madam. Congratulations, my dear. Stefan, the train is leaving. Just a minute. How long have you been standing here? I don't want to go. Do you believe that? I'll be here when you get back. Come on. Yes. Stefan, hurry, please. I still know so little about you. You like mystery. That a woman like you exist, and I found you. That's mystery to me. Say "Stefan", the way you said it last night. Stefan. As if you've said it all your life. Better hurry, sir. Yes. Good-bye. Stefan. Good-bye. Won't be long. I'll be back in two weeks. Good-bye. Two weeks. "Two weeks... Stefan, how little you knew of yourself." "That train was taking you out of my life." "He was a married man." "Does he live here in Vienna?" "If we knew who he was," "He might be willing to accept his responsibility." You won't tell us his name? But you haven't the means to take care of the child. We'll get along. It's your duty to tell us. When a man does... I'm feeling tired. Would you go? "You may wonder why I never came to you for help." "I wanted to be one woman you've had known," "Who had asked you for nothing." "My deep regret is that you never saw your son." "There were times during those years, I prefer not to remember." "But this I can assure you," "Whatever the cost, he'd repaid me a thousand times." "You'd have been proud of him, too." "When he was almost nine." "As much for his sake as mine, I married." "You know who my husband is." "Johann Stauffer asked to marry me." "Knowing the truth about us, and about our child." Oh. How lovely. Thank you, Johann. What a nice birthday! This..., and Stefan home. You know, I'm not good at saying such things. But... Lisa, I want you to be as happy as you've made be. If I were really deserving why, I'll be ready on time. You are happy? You are? "Why shouldn't I be?" Let's say good night. Is he another talent? He has a lot of talents, but not for finishing his milk. Or for brushing his teeth. Made in Switzerland. Switzerland must be a very nice place, don't you think? Who gave it to you, darling? Herr Frank. Who's Herr Frank? His music teacher. He said that he thinks that I've a natural talent. For harmonica? No. For music. Oh. Good night, Stefan. Good night, Sir. Good night, darling. Good night, mother. Mother! Yes! I'll be right back. You remember the last time, first night I was home from school. Um-hum, what about it? When you went out, you let me sleep in your room. Alright. It's a special concession because it's your first night home. But hurry. I'm late. In just a minute. There's no hurry. Good night, Sir. Good night. You know, Stefan, it might be nicer... If you could say "Good night, father!"instead of ood night, Sir" But I've always said it that way. I think he'd like it if you could manage to change it. Suppose you said to me "Good night, Madam." It would sound pretty silly, wouldn't it? Now, promise me you'd go to sleep, and not wait up for me. I promise. Would you bring me the program of the opera? I promise. Good night, Madam. Good night, Sir. After all when a person treats you so much like his son, he is in a sense your father. Alright, mother, if you say so. Good night. "The course of our lives can be changed by such little things" "So many passing by, each intent on his own problems." "So many faces, that one might be easily lost." "I know now. Nothing happens by chance." "Every moment is measured. Every step is counted." Curtain. Curtain going up. Second act. Curtain going up. Second act. Look! Isn't that Stefan Brand? He played last week. Is that a concert tour? Pleasure trip, most likely. The way he's burning himself up, it's a wonder he's still alive. Ten years ago, he showed great promise. Too bad. With that talent, he could've been a great pianist. Perhaps talent is not enough. Perhaps he's have too many talents. Second act! Curtain going up! Sorry. We're late. You know the colonel Kohner... Everyone is asking for you. You've made a conquest. My dear, you should have joined us. "Suddenly, in that one moment." "Everything was in danger." "Everything I thought was safe." "Somewhere out there were your eyes. And I knew I couldn't escape them." "It's like the first time I saw you." "The years between were melting away." I have a headache. No. Please don't worry. I'll be alright. Please stay here. Would you be kind enough to give my husband a message. He's in 17. Not now. But after the show. Tell him, I've decided to go home. Tell him not to worry. Thank you. Call my carriage, please. Yes, Madam. Sergeant! Yes, Madam. Excuse me. You must realized that where there's a pursuit. And there'd also be a pursuer. I've seen you somewhere, I know. I followed you upstairs. And watched you in your box. But I couldn't place you. And I had to speak with you. I know how it sounds. I assure you in this case that it's true. Believe that, don't you? Yes. Thank you. Now please, just a moment. Is there any place we could have met, that I might have seen you? At one of my concerts? There must have been sometime ago. I haven't given any concerts in Vienna lately. Or anywhere else in that matter. You don't play anymore? Oh, it's not quite as final as that. I always tell myself that, "Beginning next week." And when next week comes, it's this week. So, I wait for next week again. What are you waiting for? It's a very disturbing question. My carriage... You can't ask such a question, and just walk away. I have a feeling... please don't think I'm mad. I know it sounds strange. I can't explain it. But I feel that you understand what I can't even say. And that you can help me. Have you ever shopped for places like cards, Hoping to find the one... Lies somewhere at the edge of your memory. The one you've been waiting for. But tonight, when I first saw you. And later when I watched you in the darkness. It looked like one face amongst others. Who are you? Promise me, I'll see you again. I must see you. I don't know. Johann, you don't think I want this to happen? What are you going to do? I don't know. Lisa. We have a marriage. Perhaps it's not all you once hoped for. But... You've a home, and your son. People who care for you. I know that, Johann. I'll do anything to avoid hurting you. But I can't help it. And your son? Can you avoid hurting him? He won't be harmed I'll see to that. There're such things as honor, and decency. I told myself that hundred times this one evening. You talk like it is out of your hands. It's not, Lisa. You have a will. You can do what's right, what's best for you. Or you can throw away your life. I've had no hope but his ever. That's romantic nonsense. Is it? Johann, I can't help it. I can't dispute that. What about him? Can't he help himself, either? I know now that he needs me as much as I've always needed him. Isn't it a bit late for him to find that out? We're home, Sir. Good night. Good night, Sir. Lisa. If you do this, you can never turn back. You know that, don't you? Yes. I warn you. I shall do everything in my power to prevent it. Hello, darling. Wake up. It's time to go to your own room. Did you have a nice time? Yes, darling. Good night, father. Good night. Did you hear? I just said it. Yes, darling. Tell me about the opera... was it exciting? How's that? You're wonderful. You're wonderful. You've always been a wonderful boy. You know how much that it's meant to me? Be so proud of you, always. I know it. Don't worry, mother. Two weeks will go like an express train. You sure you're coming? Of course. I promise. You can even get my room in the village for me. I'll get you the same one you're there last time. The one with the balcony. Didn't I tell you that compartment was quarantined? I'm sorry, Madam. This compartment had to be closed up. I'll take you to the next cart forwards. That's good. I'll be near the locomotive. I'll take the box. Do we have two locomotives on our train? We usually get along with one. But I will talk to the engineer. How about that one over there? You can have two seats in there. He's travelling alone. Don't worry about it, Madam. I'll take good care of him. We leave in about a minute. Better hurry and get your seat. You'll see better if you sit over here. And if you get chilly, you can put up the window. Yes, mother. Stefan. You know how I've longed for you to being home. And now I can't even explain. I hope some day, very soon... I'll be able to give you a reason. But now, you just have to believe that it's for your own good. I don't mind going back so much. Especially when you're coming so soon. It'd be like two vocations. Alright, darling. I'll show you the new walk we found since you're there last time. Better get out, lady. You'll write me often, won't you? Yes mother. But I can't write very often. We've only two weeks. Good-bye, mother. Two weeks. Make way, please. Make way, please. What happened? Someone hurt? No reason to get alarmed. They said that it's typhus. Typhus? Yes. Typhus on the train. Yes. Madam. Yes. Is Mr. Brand here? Stefan Brand. Brand? One moment, please. Fritz! Um? Could you tell me has Mr. Brand been here this evening? Oh, Mr. Brand is no longer a customer of ours. Not for sometime. Mr. Brand these days is more likely to be found at the Ritz. Thank you. Good evening, Madam. I still have nice flowers left. I'm closing up. And I've saved you a nice bouquet. Very cheap. I'll take those, the white ones. Don't bother wrapping them up. Doesn't matter. Now, drive. Drive on! Stefan Brand. Is he in? Thank you. This is a surprise. But I assure you're a very happy one. John didn't prepare me for such pleasant occasion. I thought last night... The darkness might've played tricks with my eyes. You're even more beautiful than I imagined. Very kind of you. This is just the hour for a bit late supper. Or is it too late? Oh, it makes no difference. You're here. As far as I'm concerned, all the clocks in the world have stopped. Excuse me a moment. John! John, I'm sorry to send you out so late. Would you go out to the corner, and get a few things. We're going to have supper. The usual things. John makes life possible for a hopelessly single man. She fascinates you, too! Do you remember... The Greeks built a statue to a God they didn't know. But hoped someday would come to them. But mine happened to be a Goddess. And you've never found her? For years, I never woke in the morning, but I said to myself, "Perhaps today she will come. My life will really begin." Sometimes it seemed very near. But now I'm older, and I know better. Even for yourself, you don't play anymore? Oh, I remember last night, you're kind enough to be interested... I forgot John locked it when I went away. Nowadays, I'm away quite a lot of time. I'll ask him for the key when he comes back. You are very lovely. It's a beautiful dress. Thank you. How could you do that? Give it up altogether. Well, if you're so curious, I'll tell you. One night I came back to this room. I had given a concert like all the others. Not bad, and not worse. Afterwards, they said all the usual things. The things you say when you are not really convinced. So, I happened to look into the mirror. This one here. The young prot was no longer young. Certainly wasn't perpetual. Since then, I found other things to do. More amusing things. I knew last night. Didn't you? I haven't even offered to fix you a drink. Stefan? Yes. I came here... I have something to tell you. If it has something to do with you, l'm very interested. It has to do with us. We can't possible be serious this early in the morning. At least not without a glass of champagne. Won't take a minute. Champagne tastes much better after midnight, don't you think? Much better. I've just came back from America. It's a fascinating country. The men are fond of money. And their wives... are fond of Europeans. Must have been a wonderful trip? Have you travelled a great deal? I couldn't get you out of my mind all day. No, I don't believe you. If I only knew you're coming... To tell you the truth, I never dared to hope that you could arranged it so soon. But you're so clever, you managed so beautifully. You know, you're a very strange woman. Am I? Something you've said last night, it keeps running through my mind. What was that? I'll tell you in just a moment as soon as I get the ice. Are you getting lonely out there? Very lonely. "I come to tell you about us." "To offer you my whole life." "But you didn't even remember me." Can I take you somewhere, young lady? Anywhere at all? It makes no difference. "I don't remember where I went." "Time will pass me." "Not in days, or in hours." "But in the distance that put between us." "Now I think again. I went to my son." "But it was too late." "He died last night of typhus." "Without even knowing I was there." "Now I'm all alone." "My head throbs, and my temples are burning." "Perhaps God has been kind. and I too have caught the fever." "If this letter reaches you, believe this..." "That I love you now as I've always loved you." "My life can be measured... "By the moments that I've had with you and our child." "If only you could've shared those moments." "If only you could've recognized what was always yours." "Could've found what was never lost." "If only..." You remembered her? Lisa... Lisa... Bring my things. Ready, gentleman? "If only you could've recognized what was always yours." "Could've found what was never lost..."
