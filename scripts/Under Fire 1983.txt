Good to see you. What the hell you going to Zambezi for? I thought I'd get some great shots of your head being blown to smithereens. Smithereens. Thought you were fighting for the government. I am. This is the government. These are the rebels. The fuck they are, man. This is a government convoy to Calunda. This is the Abou Deian Revolutionary Front. You're shitting me. They'd be pissed off if they knew. This is the dumbest motherfucker I ever signed up for, man. It don't even pay shit. Nicaragua. That's the spot. Cheap shrimp, lot of rays. It's real thin in the spook department, too. You dig me? Price, you don't know what you're doing up there! But you better get your ass down here, buddy! Come on, man, get down here! You're gonna get ripped to shit! Oates, what the hell is this? The U.S. government offers that house to any Cuban pilot flying MIGs for the rebels who chooses to defect to America with a Russian jet. But that's bullshit. Yeah, we know that, but they don't. See, they figure the Cubies are gonna go straight for that swimming pool, so they don't let 'em anywhere near the Russian jets. The rebels can't fly MIGs. Pricey, that's the point. They destroy their own air force. I mean, it's an old scam, but it's guaran-fuckin'-teed. Who is this? C.I.A? Yeah. The smartest guys in the world. I guess we found out where the government is. Yeah. You can walk to work from here. What a break. - I guess I'll get going. Take care. - Yeah. Be careful. I love Africa. "And so this strange war grinds into its seventh year. "From N'djamena, Chad, this is Claire Sheridan." No, no, you didn't hear any music. It must be the connection. Okay. Yes, yes, yes. Goodbye. Alex, don't play that goddamn thing when I'm filing. We're late. It's my party. We'll be late. You called it a strange war in an endless story. You know, if you filed that story with me, I would say you were editorializing. Well, I like to editorialize. You drunk? Drunk? Only with the memory of making love to you on the plains of Fianga, with the First Liberation Army marching by and opening fire. - And freed the proletariat? - And freed. I love you. I'm going to the party without you. I don't want to go to this stupid party. I'm bad at false modesty. - Come on, you're great at it. - You're right. I am. Alex, you're gonna make a great anchorman in New York. And undoubtedly I can win an Emmy as a hostess, but I'm not going with you. You could operate out of New York. We could buy a place on Long Island, burn our suitcases. I still like suitcases. I'm tired of memorizing who the President of the Republic of Maldives is. You tired of Third World wars? No, I'm tired of Third World elevators. Look... Wait. Don't leave me. I have to, Alex. Oh, fuck Abou Deia and New York. - I'm going to Nicaragua with you. - No! I hear it's a neat little war and a nice hotel. Hey! Alex! Alex! Come on! Yeah! All right, I want you to know. This is the man that hired me for my first job. And fired you from your first job. And then hired me for my second job. Some of you... Some of you may be asking yourself, "What am I doing here in this strange war? "Another chapter in an endless struggle "that's grinding into its seventh year." But who of us can forget the giant struggle on the plains of Fianga? The give and take, the lunging, the parrying for position, the jockeying around knowing full well that... Well, thank you very much. Look at this. You beside me here beneath the blue My dream of love is coming true Within our desert caravan Night and stars above are shining bright Oh. Oh, excuse me. I didn't know you were in here. Yes, you did. You were taking pictures of me all over the room. Well, you know... I mean... Geez, you look great. Thanks. Here. This is for Alex. That's lovely. But I'm afraid it's not the best thing you could give him right now. Why not? We just split up. Who split up from whom this time? - This time? - Yeah. This time I'm the villain. I just thought it would be a lot cleaner with me in Central America and him in New York. Did he shout about burning your suitcases? Yes. You know, I don't own any suitcases. There's nothing to burn. This is a great shot. Yes, it is. Rafael! Rafael! Rafael! - Hey, Russel, how are you? - Hey! Welcome to Managua. All right. Did you have anything to do with that? Well, I thought of calling your photographs "The Pictures of a Lost War." I'm great with captions. New York editors loved it. Especially since they didn't know where in the hell Chad was anyway. It kind of legitimized their ignorance. You got your cover, I got a feature. Packaged a class struggle in three little words. Nifty? Nifty, I say. - I'm Russel Price. - I'm sorry. This is Isela Cruz. She works at the hotel, also as a translator. My pleasure. Excuse me, my Spanish is not up to shape. What did he say? He said he considers it an honor to be able to photograph our war. Russel, he's got a real way with words, hasn't he? - I can tell. - You're a hell of a translator. I know. I'm much in demand around here. Will you excuse me? If you have any questions, just ask. - Who's Rafael? - Depends on who you ask. Rafael? Comandante Rafael. He is either a Marxist dupe of Russia and Cuba or the most popular leader of a most popular democratic revolution. - Take your pick. - Hell of a face. Would he like to be photographed? You would never find him. - Wanna bet? - You would lose. He's never been photographed. Congratulations on your elephants. Oh, thank you. So far, Alex, this war has the hell beat out of Africa. You're gonna have a ball. - Alex, come here! Alex! - Hands off, okay? I need a translator much more than you do right now. I thought you were hanging in there with Claire. Yeah, I'm hanging in there, like an interim post-war government waiting for the palace to be overrun by younger men. Younger men? Yeah, Russel. You know, I still only have one major weakness. - Oh, only one? - Only one, yeah. I hold on to things too long. I'm too loyal. Okay, okay, Alex, listen. Jody borrowed a hundred rials from me in Tehran. I owe 40 bucks to Dick since Christmas, and he'll pay me in lira for a future in pesos. Good rate. It's okay. But you gotta pay Eddie the 50 you owe him in dollars so I can square it with Chuck. We got it all worked out in cash. You take Nicaraguan? But I'll go double or nothing with you on the whole pile. Okay. November 2nd, 1963. Martin Luther King. I have a dream. - Diem was assassinated. - Oh, shit! How'd you know that? - Your first cover. - First cover. Right. - Thank you. Hey. - Okay. Moonlight in Vermont Moonlight in Vermont I'm sorry. Sometimes the flash doesn't work. Maybe I can fix it for you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Alex, please come here. That's you. There's not many places left where I can still play. Right. Oh, that's great. I like it. Spring is here No mistaking Well, hell, I just got off the boat. Give me the scoop on Nicaragua. Well, about 60 years ago, the U.S. Marines invaded to protect American business interests. They put down a small peasant revolt led by a very small man wearing a giant cowboy hat named Augusto Sandino. No, no, no, no. I don't mean the peasant stuff. I mean the real stuff. Come on. Well, there are two kinds of beer. Toni and Victoria. Victoria's better. And two, watch out for Miss Panama. - Hot, hot, hot, but don't touch. - No? She belongs to Tacho. And El Presidente has said that if he catches anybody with her, - he will personally cut off the guy's... - Pecker? Right. And throw it in Lake Managua. I know the tune Love, this is it You've heard it before You're gonna love this war, Russel. There's good guys, bad guys and cheap shrimp. And Alex singing in the background. We've got to get alone somewhere. Around the New Year Now it's safe for lovers just to go Jesus, he's doing that on purpose. Alex is one of the world's experts on military strategy, you know. Spring can really hang you up the most - Price! - Regis! Congratulations on the African snaps. They were marvelous. - Hello, Claire. - Well, thank you. - Haven't seen you since... - Three Mile Island? Yes. Holiday Inn, right? Well, look who walked in. Oh. Before you fall in love, darling, that's Marcel Jazy, friend of wine, women and Somoza. Yeah, I know. He's also a businessman in search of a business who doesn't try very hard to cover up his connection to Washington. I like his connection in Nicaragua tonight. - But look at those moves. - Yeah. Can the C.I.A. light cigarettes like that? One more Melody A little champagne so we might make a toast. Please stay at your table and you won't be hurt. Come on. Let's go. Hold on. Alex, it's Charlie from New York. He says a nightclub bombing isn't big enough to hold for the World section. Tell him there were pieces of body in the piano, and somebody was singing Moonlight in Vermont. What's he got better than that? He's got the Pope in Egypt. Terrific. Forget the Pope, Charlie. You got the Pope someplace every week. There's a big story down here, because it's the first sign of fighting in Managua. Get a map, Charlie. Look up Nicaragua. You drive to New Orleans, and then you turn left. Oh, like hell I'm editorializing. Look, the whole thing happened in a room full of press and C.I.A. How do I know they were C.I.A? Because they wore nametags. What do you think? Look, we're backing a fascist government again. I know that's not exactly news, but see if you can find an angle? Alex, come on. You know, there's fascist and there's fascist. Let's not go throwing words like that around, okay? No, we don't have any pictures of Rafael, because nobody knows where the son of a bitch is. Anybody crazy enough to go out and look for him is gonna get his nuts shot off. Same to you, Charlie. What do you want? We've met, Alex. Hub Kittle. From Lewitsky and Knupp. New York, Public Relations. I have a client down here. Who's your client? President Somoza. Yeah, I know, I know. But there's an untold story here, you know. I mean, the man has a point of view, too, right? - Right. - Right. You're Price, right? Russel? I'm Hub Kittle. I need to know whether it's Russian or Cuban-made guns were brought in. If the guerrillas had help, the war would have ended long time ago. Well, that's fine, but we need proof. Claire! It's your daughter from Los Angeles. Hello? Hello, darling, how are you? Has your grandmother spoiled you silly by now? She has? Great. Yes, yes, I got the letter with the picture of your dress. You don't think it's cut a little too low? You don't? Well, I do. Wait a minute. I'm a journalist. Here, I got my passport. You're a priest? A padre. The government accused me of knowing Rafael. Governments are always wrong? - Who are you? - Periodista. I'd like to find Rafael myself. Whose side are you on? I don't take sides, I take pictures. No side? Go home. Mr. Price, it was all a misunderstanding. Your camera. I'm sorry. Passport. Before you go, there are some papers you will sign. What papers? Your visitation papers, Mr. Price. You were not arrested. You just came to visit, in case your embassy asks. You want your passport back, yes? - You okay? - I'm fine. How'd you know where to find me? Where else would I find you? What happened? Oh, I was just visiting. Jazy was there. I think he had me released. - Jazy? Think there's a story? - Yeah. Oh, I don't know. But it's a place to start looking. Looking for what? I'm gonna find Rafael. Now, Russel, we have to be clever with Jazy. Hey, don't worry. I'm not gonna come right out and ask him if he's a spy or not. Are you a spy or aren't you? Spy is such an odd word, Mr. Price. Nobody's a spy anymore. Russel prefers pictures to words. You don't have to apologize. You are journalists. And you're a businessman? A businessman. That sounds good. Okay, I am a businessman. Why was I arrested and then released? Who the hell are you? If she dove in, I assure you she would not notice. Please. You were arrested because the Guardia are clowns who specialize in excess. You were released because I told them to release you. Thank you. But those aren't the normal duties of a businessman. But they are the normal duties of a spy. You win, I am a spy. Are you happy? I feel better. Now we can relax. You can turn off your little thing. Oh, I trust you won't say anything to hurt me. Why would we want to do that? In some ways, I am a terrible spy. I used to be much better at it, but now it seems everyone knows who I am. I have too many girlfriends. I like to be photographed. I talk too much. I always talk too much. But my girlfriends like that. No matter. Marcel? Do you know who she is? No. That's Miss Panama. Do you know who that is? Yes, I do. She's in love with me. I've got to get some water in the pool. And once a week I have lunch with President Somoza to discuss security measures against the Sandinista insurgents, and all he wants to talk about is Miss Panama. He is worried about her. He thinks she's seeing another man? And he assigned me to find out who the man is. Thank you. We all know the revolutionaries are going to win, don't we? You know, I saw this picture on a leaflet in Africa. You know what they all say about it? They say you're the genius that created that idea. It was a lot of people's idea. Have you been to Len? No. We're going to Masaya. We understand the rebels have entered the cuartel. You would love Len. A nice cathedral, beautiful light. We're not doing a travelogue, you understand. Of course, of course. Only I have heard that Comandante Rafael was recently in the area. Rafael's near Len? Well, it's a rumor. What do I know? Marcel? She's lonely. Well, we don't want to keep you from anything. It's my job. Do you think I talk too much? So Rafael's near Len. Did you dream about Miss Panama last night? No, I dreamed about you. Have a good time? Yeah. So did you. Is that an old war injury flaring up? Is that tape recorder on? Absolutely. Well, yeah, I was sunning myself on the deck of the U.S.S. Pueblo when the North Koreans attacked and I took a bullet right here in the chest. But, you see, I was lucky. I had a roll of high speed ektachrome in my pocket right here over my heart. Oh, and the bullet ricocheted over the film and grazed your cheek and then... Yeah, saved my life. You heard about it? Do you ever dream about me? Yeah, once. How was it? Fast. - How fast? - Real fast. You mean this fast? That's another Rafael sign. It's June 10th. The evacuation of Len. Signs for the F.S.L.N. are everywhere. A woman carries a pig. Carlos! Come with us. - Americans? - Yes. - Journalists? - Yes. When you get back to the States, I want you to give this ball to Dennis Martinez from me. Dennis Martinez. Dennis Martinez. You come. You come? Yes. Price, is that you? You motherfucker Price, is that you? Yeah. Where are those bastards? They away? They're away. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. It's not my blood. - That kid's got a good arm. - Yeah. What the fuck are you doing here? What the fuck are you doing here? Oh, man, my ears are freaking out. You're looking good. How do you like Nicaragua? It's beautiful. Yeah, it's a shitload of greasers, though, you know? - Pricey, I'll see you later, man. - Yeah. Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. The kid's got a hell of an arm. Koufax was good. Dennis Martinez, he is the best. He's from Nicaragua. He pitches major leagues. I'd like to find Rafael. He was here. But he is gone. He's gone to Matagalpa, no? Rafael cannot be found. You understand, compaeros? What's Rafael doing in Matagalpa? You see Dennis Martinez, you tell him that my curve ball is better. That I have a good scroogie. I like Sandinistas. And I like Baltimore Orioles. You bastard! What are we gonna do about him? He's dead. You can't believe everything you hear on the news. I think about you all the time. I'm gonna try and get back before you graduate. I love you very, very much. I'll finish this up back at the hotel, honey. Bye-bye now. I know who shot Pedro. Somebody in the bell tower. Why didn't you tell the guerrillas? Because I didn't know they'd kill him. Hell, I didn't want to interfere. It wasn't an easy choice. Well, I think I made the wrong one. Do you know that you didn't shoot any pictures after that whole thing was over? I didn't, did I? Jesus, I picked up the gun. Is something happening to us? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. How was Matagalpa? No bang-bang, Alex. None at all. You find anything? Half the press corps. Hello? Claire? Hey. - Alex. - How you doing? How was Len? Bloody. Claire, I'm tired of Nicaragua. You haven't been here very long. Yeah. Long enough. Long enough. You were right. Everybody's right. About what? These cheekbones. What do you think of 'em? I like your cheekbones, Alex. Is there anything the matter? It's a face made for television. You mean you decided to go with the network? Yeah. They're gonna give me 10 grand a week to read the news. I'll be in 60 million homes every night. When I take a breath, all of America will take a breath. When my voice trembles, all of America will tremble. I'm gonna be a star. My vocal inflection will be more important than who controls Congress. And your name will become a household word. I'll become a household word. I should never have come down here. I'm sorry, Alex. I think it's a lot better this way. It's all right. Don't worry about me. I'm speaking in song titles. But promise me one thing. I'll promise you anything. No farewell parties. I don't want to make a speech to anyone. - Russel? - Russel who? Him, too. You're running late to your own lunch, Mr. President. - We could schedule this for another time. - Nonsense. Let them wait. We are a stunning couple? My stomach is like rock. I've been working out. Yes, we are a stunning couple. Mr. President, you own one-fifth of all the land in Nicaragua. You own the shipping port, the national airlines, the Mercedes dealership. Is it a crime to be a car dealer? Let me show you something. It's been reported the Guardia operates a torture chamber at Coyotepe. This is a portrait of my father. He was very special to me. Every Sunday morning I drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on his grave. I think people should know that. Would you care to comment on the fall of Len to the rebels? Listen, Russel, let's grow up? It's very easy to fall in love with the underdog, but there's an upside and a downside to this thing. I just want to remind you all this stuff about a "Revolution of Poets" is crap. It's great PR, though, isn't it, Hub? So what's the upside? Simple. And it could happen. Somoza destroys the terrorist insurgents, rebuilds the country, shitcans the purveyors of excess, stabilizes the Cordoba, and is finally beloved as the savior of Nicaragua. - Our pal. You got a smoke? - Yeah. What's the downside? Commies take over the world. Seor Kittle. Excuse me, Russel, but the war may be over. This is a democracy, and I have been freely elected by my people. There were more votes than voters in the last... I am sorry. I have to conclude this most pleasant encounter, but something happened. I have many more questions, Mr. President. Did he tell you about his parents and the graveyard and the flowers - and all that stuff? Good. - Yes, I know about that, but I'd like to... My friends, this gathering was not supposed to be a press conference as much as a get-together. But I've just been handed a piece of news. Rafael is dead. He has been killed in an ambush near Matagalpa. Sorry, my friends, no questions, please. No questions, please. A press release is being prepared. - What do you think? - I don't know. Tacho makes that speech about once every six months. Maybe this time he got lucky. - Hey, Hub, is this for real? - Yeah, sure. Russel, excuse me, but Miss Panama would like her picture taken with Tacho. - And in color? - Oh, okay. A little embarrassing? That'll be fine right there. Right there. How in the hell could Tacho find Rafael? Russel, please, I have my hands full. That's fine, right there. Is Tacho lying again? They did kill him, didn't they? What do I know? Tacho needs a victory very badly. He needs to prove to Jimmy Carter that he is still winning. The death of Rafael is the proof he needs. Carter doesn't need proof. He just sent 25 million in new arms to Tacho. No, no. No, he did not. The State Department is getting nervous about what is going on down here. Pardon my French, but whose fucking side are you on? I work for everybody. That's a great job. I send messages to Jimmy, and I tell him that the revolution is a flood which cannot be stopped, but can be controlled. Nobody listens to me. I can't even get a little water in my pool. Oh, would you switch sides, please? For just one more. It's very nice, very nice. Thank you. I think Rafael is alive. I'm gonna find him. Thank you very much. There's the guy we're lookin' for. Terrific. Go one more block. Oh, shit. I'm not going to die in Matagalpa. - Calm down, Regis! - I'm not staying. For Christ's sake, all they wanted to do was look at our credentials. What are you doing? Get down! Jesus. Look out! Stop! Stop it! Let's go! You all right? Stay down. - You all right? - Yeah. The translator from the hotel. You looking for Rafael? Yeah, if it's possible. How'd you know? Mr. Price doesn't do anything before announcing it first to the whole world. It's a good story. You'll be more famous. What is it? Rafael's dead. I can smell it. Come on. What are you talking about? He's dead. I know it. I wonder what they want with us? I don't know. This is Comandante Cinco. Len has fallen and today we took Matagalpa. Masaya is next, and then Managua. Because Nicaragua will soon be free, Mr. Price, we've decided that it's time for you to meet Rafael. We need a photograph. You mean the Western press needs a photograph. Mr. Price, the world is not divided into east and west anymore. It's divided into north and south. Come with us. You are a great photographer. Make him alive. Why are you laughing? You're crazy. We have momentum, but many more lives will be lost. Even Washington is starting to admit that the butcher Somoza is not loved by his people. They have detained $25 million in new arms shipments for Somoza at an airfield in Florida until they find out if Rafael is alive or dead. If Washington thinks Rafael is dead, they will ship the arms to Somoza. Do you understand? Yes. But I'm a journalist. This has nothing to do with journalism. Enough of our people have been lost already. We need to keep him alive a few more days. Once the war is over, none of this matters. I don't do things like this. I know this is difficult for you but you must do it. In the morning? When there's better light. It will be a great picture. It sure would be a prizewinner, wouldn't it? I've won enough prizes. But you haven't won a war. Are you sure? Yeah, it's complicated, all right. Do I go back and say I missed the biggest story in the war? Do I go back and say that I saw Rafael stone-cold dead? Or do I just say that we fell in love with the guerrillas because their cause was... Sympathetic? Yeah, sympathetic. Christ, what are we doing here? You. That's fine. Yeah, that's good. All right. Marcel. Under a still, gray July sky... Start again. Under a clear, steel Managua... Scratch it. President Somoza has ordered the Air Force to bomb the capital under a sky of... - Hi. - Hi. Look. Oh, my God. What the hell is he doing here? I have no idea. Can you frame me with that smoke in the frame? Got it? - Yeah, we got the smoke. - We're rolling. Speak. This is Regis Seydor in Managua. This tiny nation of smoldering volcanoes has erupted into a civil war. Fighting has broken out on the streets of the capital city for the first time in nearly 50 years. Hi. - Alex. - Congratulations. - On what? - On what? The news services, the wire, the Washington Post, The Times. Everybody's picked it up. It's a fabulous picture. - Oh! - Yes, it really is fabulous. Yeah, it is. How come you're back? I came back to see Russel. See me? About what? The whole East Coast has fallen in love with Rafael. They were sure he was dead this time. They're gonna do a musical on his life. You can't walk through Central Park without seeing his mug on T-shirts. He's bigger than Farrah Fawcett. You look great. Things okay? Things are great, yeah. I've never been happier. You two... - Oh. - Terrific. Alex, you know me, I'm a little slow. - Yeah. - Exactly why are you here? I want to do an interview with Rafael. You're the only man in the world who can take me to see him. What's the matter? Nothing. We may not be able to find him, you know. I have supreme confidence in you. Claire looks good. Everybody looks good in the tropics. What the hell does that mean? Alex, I'm in love with her. Yeah, I know it. She thinks she loves you. No. It's past the thinking stage. Can I ask you something? This probably doesn't mean a goddamn thing in the grand scheme of things, but it's something that interests me. Were you guys making it before we came down here? No! - Is that the truth? - Yes! For God sakes, Alex! We're friends! You must go through a lot of rental cars. Don't worry. I put it in your name. Come on, come on, come on. Hey, Pricey! Welcome to Somoza's meat market. Hey, no pictures? It might look bad. What do you get paid, by the hour or by the body? I get paid the same way you do. Hey, what the fuck are you doing in Sbaco, man? This place is about to blow, ain't it? Why'd you shoot Pedro? Who the fuck is Pedro? Jesus Christ. My God. There's a motherfucking war going on here, pal! There's a lot of sad stories. Yeah, but what... Did you know those guys? Yeah. I used to. You're a motherfuckin' cocksucker! I don't suck no dick, man! You goddamn... I prefer not to blow your brains out in a dump like this! I got my priorities! Guy wants to be hero, pops. You better get him out of here before he's a number. It'd be a shitty little town to buy it in! Why them? Just, why them? Why them? Why them? Come here, I'll show you why them! You, too! Come here! Come here! If your mug shows up in this box here, you try to make it through Sebaco, I own your ass! Where did you get those photographs? What is this, a fucking interview? I ain't that dumb. All right, all right, all right. I'm not gonna quote you. Now where did you get those pictures? Off the record? Some pachuco gives 'em to me. Ain't none of my business, but I hear he gets 'em from a Frenchy. They tell me Somoza likes the women but this one ain't got a chance. Nice? You ever meet Tacho? A real piece of work. Oh, Jesus. Is she dead? Not yet. Hey, give me those pictures. Hey, you got any dope? Tough place to find decent dope. Hey, what do you expect? We're the ones getting our butts kicked! God! Some motherfucker stole my fucking pictures and I don't know what fucking happened! God damn it! Fuck me! Didn't you ship your film to New York, for Christ's sake? Nah, I developed it in my room. Oh, Jesus Christ, Alex! Come on, slow down, man. It's not your fault if somebody took your... Yes, it was. What about Rafael? I don't think it's Jazy. Oates said it was a Frenchman. How many Frenchmen do you know who live around here? I'll look here. Are we looking for negs or prints? Anything. I'll get the door. Russel? Russel? He knew I'd find Rafael. He wanted me to. Probably even knew he was dead, and I'd take pictures of every fucking thing I saw. He kills people. Let's get out of here. Well, we've been to every bar in town, I still don't see Rafael. Yeah, well, just hang in there a minute. This is what I wanted to show you. Wait a minute. You brought us through three roadblocks a half an hour before curfew to show us a state of Tacho? It's not Tacho. It's Mussolini. See, when Tacho went to Italy to commission a statue of himself, he found a warehouse full of il duce on horseback. Got a great deal on one, brought it back here. He switched heads. You can't tell, can you? What are we doing here? I think what he's trying to say, what we're trying to say, is that things aren't exactly the way they seem to be. Oh, great. Well, things don't seem to be too great, so I can't wait to hear this one. Here we are, two guys in love with the same dame, - in the tropics, bullets flying... - Alex! - That's not why we're here. - Oh, yeah? I left this country because of this man. I came back because of this man. Now the cutest couple in town's got me looking up a horse's ass on a midnight tour of Managua. What's goin' on? Rafael is dead. - In the picture he's dead? - He's dead! - All right, how in the hell did you... - Who cares how? Alex, I think I finally saw one too many bodies. Somoza is a killer. I thought the war would end sooner. How many reasons do you want? You saw too many bodies? That's a lot of bodies. You stupid son of a bitch! Did he talk you into this? No. I wanted Rafael to be alive. Had you been there, you'd understand! I've seen a hundred Rafaels. I've seen a hundred Somozas. Don't you ever tell me who's sentimental. You just served me up your careers. I could bury both of you! Look around you! Look at the war! Can't you see what's going on? I'm not just talking about Rafael. That's a lie I despise, but I understand. I'm talking about the two of you lying to me, dragging me around town. I didn't know how you'd take it, Alex! How could you lie to me? Now this is a motherfuckin' story! What am I supposed to do with it? No, play. You found Rafael yet? You know, there's a rather strange one going around about him. Thought you might have the answer. You see, there's a rumor that Rafael is dead. That Price's pictures are phony. That's bullshit. Rafael's alive. All right. Alex? Listen, I feel terrible. - I want to talk. - I don't. Listen, tomorrow I want you to take me to try to find Jazy. I'll do a piece on this sexy French spy, and then New York can take it or leave it. We looked for Rafael and couldn't find him. - You owe me one. - Yeah, right, right. You sure this is the way to Jazy's? I hope so. I might have got turned around at the last roadblock. I thought he lived near here, but it feels different now. Yeah, when did the fighting get this close? Where in the hell are we? I don't know. I don't know what's going on down here. This looks pretty rough. This town looks like it's ready to go, Russel. Jesus! Alex, I don't like this. Let's get the hell out of here. Yeah, which way is the hotel? I'm not sure. - Turn here. - Yeah, let's go. - Take the flag with you. - I'll ask this old gal. All right. You fucks! You fucks! Psst! Seor! You. Ladies and gentlemen! Seoras y seores! May I have your attention, please? El Presidente Anastasio Somoza. It is with great concern that we announce the death of Senior Correspondent Alex Grazier, who has been murdered at the hands of the terrorists operating in the barrio El Dorado district. Roving bands of Sandinista hooligans have made the streets of Managua unsafe for our peace-loving citizens. Our deepest sympathies are extended to the friends and family of Mr. Grazier. And the international press corps is herewith informed that all necessary steps will be taken to protect its safety. Mr. Kittle has prepared statements for you. Thank you. Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, I have the statements here, if you'd like to come up and get them. Could you get my bill ready? Can you get me a taxi? - There are no taxis, sir. No cabs, sir! - I need a taxi! You won't get there! The road, everything is blocked with refugees. - Claire, I'm sorry. - Did you hear anything from Russel? - No, nobody has. - Well, do you want to help me find him? It's kind of weird out there, Claire. There's fighting all over the city. Jesus Christ, Claire, a human tragedy. What can I say? Fuck off, Hub. Russel! Russel! Alex? The Guardia did it. I've got pictures. Let's go. Yeah. Let's get out of sight for a minute. They are friends. They are friends! The boys are confused. They think I had their family killed. You are a murderer. Murder! Murder is a word for criminals! I have a job to protect the stability of a continent. Please! And you got caught by boys! Yes. Poets too, I imagine. Is your recorder on? Yes. Good. I have a speech to make. No. No photo. But I like you people. But you are sentimental shits. You fall in love with the poets. The poets fall in love with the Marxists. The Marxists fall in love with themselves. The country is destroyed with rhetoric, and in the end we are stuck with tyrants. Somoza, he is a tyrant too, of course. A butcher. But finally, that is not the point, you see. If we wish to survive, we have a choice of tyrants. And for all the right reasons, your poets choose the wrong side. No! No picture. Yes! Your picture of Rafael was brilliant. But I am alive and better-looking! A good-looking Frenchman with a sympathetic face, who is murdered in cold blood while fighting for the survival of Europe and America! You will have another magazine cover. You chose the wrong side. In 20 years, we will know who is right. Are you going to take the picture as the bullet enters the skull or as it comes out? It is just a story. They say that if somebody is holding a gun on you, you should never stop talking. That's the theory. Who knows? Maybe it's a good thing that I talk too much. We gotta get out of here. The whole fucking army's looking for me. Yeah. They're not looking for me. Let me take the film. If I can't make it back to the hotel, I'll come back here. Look, it's more dangerous being with you than being alone. Yeah, right. Get the flag. - Yeah. - We'll put the film in it. Russel? Russel? Russel. Journalist? You knew the man who was killed? Fifty thousand Nicaraguans have died and now a Yankee. Perhaps now Americans will be outraged at what is happening here. Perhaps they will. Maybe we should have killed an American journalist 50 years ago. Russel? Rafael! Rafael! Rafael! Rafael! Hey, Price. Hey, Pricey! It's all over? We made it. I like this music. What the hell are you doing here? It's a free country. I mean, it's free now anyway. Nicalibre. Rum and coke, no ice. You want some? You aren't gonna turn me in, are you? See you in Thailand. Do you think we fell in love with too much? I'd do it again.
