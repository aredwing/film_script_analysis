Hyah! Otis, get off there. Boys, get out of there! They're here. I want some men on top, both sides of the bank. Quit talking! Come on! Run! Tell everyone I shoot first. We hit 'em as they get off their horses. Keep your heads down! Deacon, you head up down the street. Get your boys across the road. Tell me when everyone's in position. You've got to do something. There's money in that bank. There's people in there. They ain't gonna get into the bank. We'll hit 'em as they dismount. Here they come. One foot in the stirrup, one in the ground. Whoa. Ya! Ya! Please, don't shoot! Shit. They know we're here. How many posse, boy? I don't know nothing about no posse... Sir. Now, what the hell is this? Tie his skinny bones to the window. Come on, move it. Tie them all to the windows and make their faces show! Knock down these beams and clear this railing. I see some posse out there! They gotta come out the front. There ain't no back door. No good, no good. Whoa hoo! Good day. We got it all. Yeah, ha ha! Hoo hoo! Dynamite, brother. Dynamite? What the hell are you doing, Graff? Take some men. Get out back now! Saddle up, boy. You're gonna burn these people? They didn't do nothing. Don't you ever question me, boy. Saddle up. He's got dynamite! Oh, god! Oh, god! Get on out of here! [people screaming] Please let us out! Don't leave us here! He's got dynamite! Let's ride! Ya! Ya! Come on! Let's ride! Get the tellers! Get the tellers out of there! Get 'em out of there! Move it! Ah! Loomis! Loomis is hit! I got you, bastard! Dynamite! They're getting away! Sheriff, you're letting them get away! Not for long. Gotcha. Come on, now. Hyah! Come on! Come on! Come on, come on! All right. The posse's on our ass. I can smell 'em. Inventory. I got one went clean through. Bullet busted two of my ribs. I took one in the leg. Bone ain't broke. That's what I got a horse for. Let me see your leg, boy. It's just a scratch. We gonna have to leave you, soldier? No. I can ride, Graff. I can ride. I'm good. Ammunition. I got 11 .36 and 23 45.40. 16 12 gauges, 18 45.40's. 9 .45 colts, 23 45.70's. 31 45.40's, and my knife. I got a handful of bullets, about 30 bullets. Potts. Count 'em. I got 20 45.40's and 8 44.40's. He's two less than 30. I got 12 45.44's. Eustis? Give Loomis 20 rounds. Loomis is hit pretty bad. Maybe we should tend to his wounds. Stop means dying, boys. We kick back here for awhile, We can tend to yours, too. Tending? I'll show you tending. Get up! Here are them bullets. You ain't gonna leave me, are you, Eustis? No, I ain't gonna leave you. I can see you're hurtin'. Try to get some miles twixt us and that posse before I look at your leg. Don't worry about it. I ain't gonna leave you. I can do it, Eustis. If they're not here, they're not coming. That hound dog's crazy. You want another man on it, boys? There ain't no posse. I know it, you know it, we all know it. Graff says there is, so there is. That's a bunch of puppy shit. There ain't no sign of no Goddamn posse. Graff's always right. He always saves our asses, like in that town. What about back at that town? He said that bank would be unguarded. He forced us across 2 1/2 days of rough terrain To this unguarded bank where we were ambushed. We ate lead, Eustis. He got us out. He got us in. [Whistle] Hey, Eustis. It's just that we blew the shit Out of that posse. There ain't no damn posse. What do you savvy, Lovecraft? I savvy what I savvy. You boys savvy what you savvy. Graff's our leader. That's all of it. We follow his lead. Got to be the way it is. Doggone it! What are you doing? You're hurtin', too. Maybe if we stop for a little while. We could make sure these wounds don't fester. What about Loomis? You know these boys are hurt? They need tending. Yeah, I know. I ain't seen no posse. I ain't seen them neither. Don't mean there ain't one, though. There probably is, but we gotta rest. A few more miles, the boys are going to be looking to you. Is that what you savvy? Whichen' ever way this goes, I'm with you. Hee yah. Come on. [Whistling] Oh, what the hell is this? Shut up, Potts! It's a song. I'm a good old rebel Good going, Lieutenant. I'm singing the song, Potts. I ain't singing that song. I don't care a damn You gonna sing a damn song? You're sick. You just gotta do something. Shut up, Potts. Shit. Full of holes, come on! Shut up, Potts. What's the problem singing, Potts? [Trying To Sing] Loomis! What's his problem? Whoa, Buck. Easy boy. Leave him. Eustis. Worthless piece of shit. He's done. [wWhistle] Graff says to leave him, Eustis. Come on. Lovecraft, what you savvy? I savvy Graff's going one way And Eustis ain't. Aaaaahhhh! Lovecraft, fuck him! Loomis, I can help you. But you gotta ride. You, all right? Eustis... Aaahhhh! Loomis. You gotta ride. Eu! Don't dally. Come on. Hang on, Loomis! Hang on! ..A soldier obeys... ..Or dies. ..But I couldn't ..Leave Loomis. ..And yet, even as I rode ..To help him ..I knew the life I was ..Trying to save ..Was not Loomis', ..But my own. Loomis, you ok? I said leave him. We never leave nobody. Never. Well, let me simplify things. Graff, he's one of us. We can't leave him. You can't ride, son. [Thunder] He used to be rich. Graff had himself a plantation down Mississippi way. A wife, three daughters. Blue coats came when he was off with forest cavalry, Burned the place to the ground. They raped his wife and daughters in front of each other And then shot them. I was with him when he heard. It was the night before the battle of Atlanta. And I saw his eyes. Something... Something died in them, boys. He never cracked at that battle And it was the bloodiest of the war. I learned everything I know'd off him. Now I'm gonna run you all to Mexico, Get you there as safe as I can, Same as he'd a done. Then I'll be free. Nobody ever stuck their hide out for me before. That's about all I can do for you. I know I said we'd never leave you, But I hope we don't have to leave that leg behind. Thanks, Eustis. Maybe it'd be better if you rode On the back of old John with me. Oh no. I'm good. You're not that good. I had 30 men back in that town. We was preparing to come out into the hills Looking you vermin. Figured it might take a month. By the grace of God, you found us. I'm much obliged, outlaw. Where's the money, Graff? Any of y'all got a smoke? I want to kill him now. I sure could use a smoke. Give him a cigarette, for Christ's sake. Here you go. Your men have stolen thousands of dollars Of my bank's money. You talk, damn you. Sharp. Go ahead. Pull the trigger. Suits me. Sharp! You better talk, drummer boy. You done killed 10 of my men. Now I've got you. Now I want Eustis and I want Philo And Goddamn you, I want all the rest! Maybe I do, too. McClintock, We ain't gonna get nothing out of this outlaw. We's wasting our time while them other outlaws Is getting away. Now, let's send him to hell! He ain't no use to us. Maybe I am. I know where the money is. It's with my men. And I know where they'd be. Are you saying you will track down your men for us? Why on earth would I trust you, Graff? My boys shot me. Bullshit! I shot ya! 400 yard shot with my long rifle. All my boys here saw I You have it your way, boy. Go ahead and shoot me. This time, pig shit, do it right. Get him on a horse. We're taking him with us. Maybe he can be of some use to us. Whether he lives or dies is of no account. It's the money that matters. You can shoot him later. I'm going to enjoy it, outlaw. I'm going to enjoy it. According to this map, The Mexican border is 50 miles due south. Obvious route is to take it Straight down across the Texas line To the Rio Grande and the border right here. This is the logical route, But maybe it's too logical. Just say Graff's right And there is a posse. There ain't no Goddamn posse. I know it, you know it, We all know it. There's no posse. The law will figure we're heading south. Someone will be after us. What about Canada? Them bones say anything about Canada? What's wrong with that? What's your savvy, Eustis? I say we head east. Where? East. No, no. You know what's east? New Jersey is east. It's no good to go east. New Jersey? That don't sound bad. Hell, I ain't goin' east. I say we head east for awhile, Throw them off our trail, thene head south. Right here we got water and medical. We know the trail. Head east. Bullshit. What do you savvy there, Lovecraft? I savvy it don't make near bit of sense. There you go. That's why it makes sense. Bullshit! It don't make no Goddamn sense! You with me? Philo? You think that's best, Eustis? I'm asing what you think. Are you with me or not? Ow! You jack ass, Potts! I say your plan is shit, Eustis. Shit? Shit. Where do we go then? We head south, straight for the Goddamn border! There ain't nothing on our ass but hair, Eustis. There ain't no Goddamn posse. There isn't. He's right. Potts is right. If there is? Then we should probably head east. I think East is probably good If we want to avoid the posse. The best idea, go east. East. Well, shit. [whistling] Pipe down, outlaw. I hate that song. I hate it! I don't need no pardon for anything I done Quit singing it. [all singing song] Quit singing the Goddamn song! Ain't that your song, Marshall? I fought with General Grant, drummer boy. Five flags strong. War's over. War ain't never gonna be over. [men continue singing] Shit. It's just a song. Come on. Yeah. Hah hah! Why we heading this way? We ought to be riding due east. Speak when you're spoken to, outlaw. Sure is mighty pretty scenery. Them boys of his is heading for the border. Why would they head east? Because they gonna be thinking We're gonna cut them off. Could be right. He's trying to lead us off. Think about it, Marshall. Graff, we're going to listen to you this one time. But if this is a trick Or if we don't find those outlaws by noon, I'll have you shot. See you at noon, drummer boy! Keep your eyes down, boys. This is the way we usually come. They could be close. I'll be. It's them. Better hit 'em now before they see us. They can't see shit. The sun's on their backs. Do something. That's what you pay me for. Ain't it, McClintock? They're out of range, Marshall. I hit you from further out than this. Just watch me, outlaw. Just watch me. My boys gonna know we're on them. Just watch me. Yoll fuck it up. You ain't gonna make that shot. Shut up, outlaw. You got a strong cross-wind. Shut up. That's a high wind. I'd recalculate about an inch up. And maybe a quarter inch to the right. Do it! The posse! Shit. Shit! Goddamn fucks! No posse, huh, Potts? What's up there, women? We should've gone south! We should've gone south! Shut up and ride! Cease fire! You're wasting ammo! Cease fire! Fucked it up, Marshall. You made me miss. Y-you just missed, that's all. I never miss. I never miss! Sure, he never misses, right? They're getting away, gentlemen. They're getting away. Let's ride! Ok, boys, mount up! Mount up! Let's go! Come on! Come on! Let's ride! Mount up! I never miss. Wait up! Three each way! Loomis, ride with me! Well, they split up. No shit. That's real helpful, outlaw. Real helpful. Trails converge about a mile up to East. No problem. Take your men to the right. Yes, sir. Let's go, boys. Follow me. Hyah! Come on! Loomis, let's see that leg. It ain't bleeding no more. We're on 'em. Ya! Ya! How the hell did they find us?! Graff was right! I knew he was right! He was right about the posse! I shoulda'shot! I swear to Christ, I shoulda' shot that kid! Whoa. Watch out. Be careful now, boys. Grubb, stay high. The rest of you watch the rocks. That's where they came out. Let's go after them. Be a damn good place to hit us. Grubb. Yes, sir. Take some of your men and check out The tracks on the other side. Come on. Ya! Get in there. Marshall, these tracks head downstream. Follow 'em! Come on, boys. Seems ok. Let's go. Hold on, Marshall! They go back into the river! Stay back! They're behind us! (yelling) All right, all right, let's move! It's time to regroup! We gotta get out of here! Eustis, I'll do one more. Potts! One more. Let's go! Lovecraft, what's wrong? Huh? Nothing. Give a hand, Grubb! Damn. They've got a lot to answer for. Mr. McClintock? I reckon we need to talk to you. Me and the boys. Well, sir, we quit. But you can't. No, we can, sir. We're volunteers and we get the right. You can't stop us. But you've shot none of the outlaws. You haven't got the money. It isn't done. As far as we're concerned it is. We keep chasing them, we'll get tired and shot. Now, the Marshall's been shot. He's the one we signed with. Need I remind you men of the reward That my bank has offered And the $1000 a head bounty? Being that you've failed to capture anyone but Graff And the outlaws still have the money, You get not one dime. Not one dime. Come on, boys, we're gone. Trash. Shit. We're wasting our time here. Maybe the boys that stay can Split the shares of the ones that left. How's that? What'd he say? Right. Find out what he said. Right. What about the shares of the boys that were killed? You can have that. That include the Marshall's share? Shit. All right, Goddamn it. Yes. Well, that could be a deal. All right, say we stay. Who's going to lead the posse? You? May I make a suggestion, gentlemen? Hey, Eus, Seeing as how you're the leader and all, Would you like to enlighten us as to The whereabouts of that saloon? How about it, Eustis? A shot of whiskey would be a good pain killer. I have powerful thirst. How about you? Once we hit the outpost, We're 20 miles from the Rio Grande and the border. You think the posse would be headed there, Whats left of them? There ain't no posse now. We blew the shit out of them. They're heading back to that sorry-ass town. Whooooo! Whooooo! Any of you boys ever been to Mexico? Nope. You? I haven't, but I've heard hellacious stories. Like what? Them Mexican senoritas, they got nipples on their titties About the size of a confederate silver dollar. Bullshit! No way, Potts. I hear they beg for it. Is that true, Eustis? That might be true. Well, I don't know about you boys, But this is my last job. I'm gonna retire down Mexico way. Use my share to buy me a nice hacienda by the sea. Get myself a nice Mexican woman on one hand, A bottle of whiskey in the other. Plant my feet in the sand And watch those long pretty sunsets. Mexico, Damn. Sounds so good it hurts. Philo, they got Philo! Blew his face off! On the ridge! Graff. Boys, ride! [whistle] Come on! Fuck! I knew it! All those men up on the ridge. They'll shoot every single o of us. We should've shot that fuckin' kid! Money in our pockets. There's your first $1000. Minus a few cents. I'm gonna cut me the trigger finger Off the notorious horace Philo. You ain't gonna touch that boy. That's one of my men. You gonna show him proper respect. Graff, let's get back on the job. You know what we gotta do? We gotta give them the money back. Graff don't give a shit about that Goddamn money! He wants us! The posse will lay off if we give them the money back! Bullshit! Eustis, Graff ain't nothing without that posse. We gotta give them the money. Come on. No, Wills, no! I got the money! Oh, shit. I'm gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch. Lovecraft, should we go and give them some of it? No! We're not going to catch him! He's got my Goddamn money! He's heading straight for the black gold. The posse's up there! I'm gonna shoot the son-of-a-bitch! Potts, hold up! Potts, wait! He'll be that far ahead when he gets there! Give it up Potts! There goes all our Goddamn money, Eustis. Shit. [hissing] Hey, Graff! Graff! Whoa. Who's that? It's the money. Something's wrong here. I don't like it. He's given back the money, by god! Looks like a trick to me. Yeah, wait on it. Just wait on it. Wait here. Careful, boys. We've been hit once already. It's all here. The money's all here. We can go back now. You've done a great job. Oh, the money! You want the money, sir? Go get it. Gunfire! Let's go! They hit us again. I don't see 'em. They got your boy. That's McClintock and the damn money. The money's history, boys. So are you, outlaw. Leave off him, Grubb. Need him to catch them son-of-a-bitches To get the $1000 each. Fuck 'em. We blast Graff, With Philo, we got $2000. I'm with Grubb! Shoot this son-of-a-bitch And get back for the reward. That's right. I say we keep him alive long enough To catch them, then kill him. What the hell are you saying?! Get the whole $8000. To hell with y'all. I'm gonna shoot him. Back up, Grubb! Fuck you. Shit! That settles that. Much obliged. Come on, Potts! Pleasure. Ok, Eustis. Oh! Ow, ow, ow, that hurt! That hurt! I saved you. I saved your asses. Whoa! Oh, lucky shot! Lucky shot! Come on, Potts! Hit him! Stay down, Wills. Come on, Potts! All right, Potts. That's enough! My Goddamn money. My Goddamn money! Kick him over here, Potts! Kick him over here, come on! Right in the nuts! You son-of-a... Son-of-a-bitch! Leave my ass behind, huh?! Should have shot the kid, huh? Should have shot the kid! There you go! All right, Potts. You can't kill him. He took my Goddamn money! And maybe saved our skins. Maybe not. [singing from a distance] ..Graff had a new gang. ..And he'd hung us all ..To the end of the earth. ..But I was the one ..He wanted. ..This was a private war. ..And I had to take the chance ..That he and I... ..Could find a private truce. My kind of place. Whiskey, sir. It's already paid for, sir. Inventory, Lieutenant. Ammo. What is it you want, Graff? Philo had 21 52s. When I threw his skinny ass over a horse, He had two left. The way I calculate it, You're all down to 35 rounds maximum. Is that right, Graff? Listen, boy. The posse's got more than 2,000 rounds. I'm trying to talk to you, Graff. And I'm trying to talk to you, too boy. A leader's got to know how many bullets his men have. You're the leader now, Eustis. And I want to make a deal. You want me to call the boys off? What you got to offer? I don't know. I don't know what to offer you. You already got all the money. You owe me more than money. A lot more. You owe me evething. What would it take, Graff? I want you to give me, give me Loomis, He ain't no good to you. Son-of-a-bitch wasn't nothing to begin with. That might do it. Or how about Potts? That Potts will give you a whole belly ache of trouble. You're the leader. Give me Wills Or Lovecraft. You can't trust any one of them. Goddamn one of them is a negro. The other one is a fool. You know I can't leave anyone. Think you could stop me from takin' out Any one of them son-of-a-bitches anytime I want? There ain't no deal you can do with me, boy. We had a deal. You were my Lieutenant And you turned on me. You shot me, Eustis. You left me for dead. Now's the time for reckonin'. Here's the deal, son. You're the last. So you make the best of it. Shit. Fuck it. Well, what happened? Where's the bottle? Where's the whiskey at? Don't ask me no questions. So long as I lead, you follow my orders, Potts. Where the fuck are you going to lead us to? I said don't argue with me, Potts. We got this posse halfway up our ass. Got 50 miles of hard ground in every direction. Where the fuck are you going to lead us? To hell and back if I say so. You got a problem with that, I'll blow your fool head off. Potts. What? I'm just trying to save you, all you boys. Know what I say? I say, you ain't fit to lead shit, Useless. Fuck you. Ah! Fuck you!

Get up now! Get up! Three down. We'll dig in here And wait for them to ride in. Bullshit! Let's just go to Mexico, Eustis! We cross that river into Mexico. We'll be safer in Mexico. Not from Graff. Ain't no place we're safe. We gotta kill him. He can't be killed. It don't make no difference. We're all gonna die. Would you shut up? Just shut up. Where the fuck are they? He was right behind us. Appear and disappear Disappear and appear. They ain't coming. Then we go get him. Same drill, inventory. I got a full pistol load and two rifle shot. I got four in my pistol, two in my rifle. Two rounds. Then we spread out. Potts, you ride 10 minutes west. Lovecraft, 10 minutes south. I'll go 10 minutes north. Regroup here in 20 minutes. If you spot Graff, stay put. Anybody ain't back in the full 20 minutes, The others go where he went. If you get a clean shot at Graff, kill him. Otherwise, don't fire. Let's go. Didn't see nothing. Me neither. We'll give Lovecraft a few more minutes. [Horse Neighs] There's a horse. Shit, that's Buck. Here, Buck. Oh, shit. Graff. Shit. I don't give a good Goddamn where they came from. [Horse Neighs From Distance] You didn't find him? No. What's wrong, Lovecraft? Long, hard ride. Just a little uneasy, that's all. Yeah, well I reckon it ain't over yet either. We got plenty now. Graff, I guess. Graff? Yeah. Graff? Ain't you gonna reload? Yeah. Reload, Lovecraft. Don't push me, Eustis! You're the gang leader, ok?! That don't mean you own me! You hear? I'll do it in my own time! All right. That's right. It's been a long, hard ride. We've taken some terrible punishment. But we can't crack now. We can't lose our heads. We don't know where Graff and that posse is. They could be seconds away. Reload now. I--I don't have to reload. I--I got a full one. You had two rounds. Yeah, but I uh...
