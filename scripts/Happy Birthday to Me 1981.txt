I was just going up to the village to meet some of the kids at the inn. You mean the second home for the Crawford Top Ten, don't you? Isn't that what the elite of the senior class like to call themselves? Well, I guess so. I beg your pardon? Yes, Mrs. Patterson. Do you know, Bernadette, if you and the other so-called members of the Top Ten would spend half the time on your books that you do down at that inn, you could all be in Harvard tomorrow. Yes, Mrs. Patterson. Just be sure you're back before midnight. Come along, Winston. Take mommy home. Come on. Come along, Winston. Give mommy head. Help me! Help me! Help me! Help! Help me. Leave me alone! Help me. It's you. Thank God. Thank God. Please help me. Please, somebody's trying... God, please, no more! No class, these Americans. Gee, thanks a lot. Amelia, I'm getting mad. These guys are really pissing me off. Greg, just settle down, okay? Etienne, you know Bernadette's going to be here any minute. Virginia! I finally made it. - Hi, Virginia. - Hi. What is this, a convention? - Where's Bernadette? - I don't know. I can't fend him off much longer. From out of the fog it comes! What's this? Who's that? Come on, guys. Grow up, okay? Alfred, come sit by me. How's the midnight taxidermist tonight? Hey, Alfred, get stuffed. Hey, Alfred, did you bring George? Sure, I brought George. Here, come on, George. Come on, come on. Say hi to George, everybody. Hi, George. Let's start the whole thing all over again. - That's it. I've had it! - Greg! - Five bucks says he creams him. - You're on. - You're really asking for it, man! - Sit down. What's with you, kid? Thank you. Can I buy you a drink? Alfred, you know the rule. We all buy our own. Let's get George a drink. Yeah, I know the rule. But I'd like to buy you a drink. Let me hold him. George. You jumped? Hi, cutie. Mr. Grand Pooh-Bah, sir! My apologies for the gross misbehaviour of my colleague. Ingrid, a steiner for the Grand Impotate. That's damn big of you, kid. Thanks a bunch. Where's George? What happened to George? - I'm sorry, I dropped him. - What? I dropped George. Oh, no! George! George! George! George! George! A special for His Eminence. As a token of our friendship and esteem, Your Wizardship. That's damn big of you. Your next round's on me. Jesus Christ, it's a rat! Time to go, kiddies. Get them! Get them! Get them! George! Get them! Get them! You'll pay for this, you creeps! You'll pay! Go! Go! Go! Everybody, just calm down. The game! Come on, everybody, let's play the game! You're on. - Greg! - Get in. - I thought I was with you. - Just get in! I'm going to call your headmistress about this! Don't forget your numbers. I go first. - I'm second! - Third! Fourth! And you're last, Greg! And 20 bucks says you got no balls. Just watch me, asshole. Go! Remember, you scumbag, that's 20 bucks! Cash! Fuck it! No! No, Greg, no! Stop the car! It's too high! Mother! He made it. Let go of me, Virginia! - We made it! - I don't want to die! No! Stop! - Stop it! You'll kill yourself! - For Christ's sake, hold on to her! - Virginia! - I want out! Come back! - Ginny, come back! - Virginia! Greg, unbelievable jump, man! - What's wrong with Virginia? - I don't know. She freaked out. You dumb shit, you could've killed her! You're the one that shoved her in my car! I'd like to break your neck. Ann! Just ease up a little, okay? She's new! She never played the game before! Maybe we should go after her. She's okay. She just lives over there. Okay, let's go. What happened to Steve? He chickened out. He's on the other side of the bridge. Hey! That nimrod owes me 20 bucks. Mother, I miss you so much. You'd be proud of me now, Mother. All the kids like me. I'm even one of the Top Ten. We go everywhere together. Who's out there? You. I'll walk you home. No, Etienne. It's just over there. I'll be fine. I know where it is. Etienne, I said I'll be fine! - Virginia? - Yes, Daddy. I was worried. Where were you? I was just out with Ann and the other kids. Honey... ...this is not the kind of night for running around. Virginia. Yes, Daddy? Honey... ...have you been over there again? I don't know why it bothers you so much. - Ginny, I thought we agreed... - No, we didn't agree! You told me what to do! I don't even have the right to go visit my own mother's grave! Ginny, Ginny, Ginny! Please. I'm so sorry. Daddy, please don't be angry with me. You can't live in the past, honey. Daddy, I have to remember. David says until I stop repressing what happened, I won't be completely cured. He says I'm progressing very quickly. Ginny, we've been happy together. I don't want any of those memories to change that. Oh, God. Sometimes I wish we'd never moved back here. I love this house. I like living here. I like my school. I like my friends. Please don't take that away from me. If this is where you want to live, this is where we'll live. This is where I want to be. Case closed. All right, then. Come on, off you go. - Good night. - Good night. I love you, Daddy. I love you too. This sort of behaviour simply must stop. As students of Crawford Academy, you have a responsibility to uphold the traditions established by your predecessors, which include being on time, Miss Wainwright, Miss Thomerson. Now, a full apology will be made to the owners of The Silent Woman. And if I hear of any more of these outrageous incidents, I will be forced to declare the inn out of bounds. It's all your fault. Is that perfectly clear? I take it that Bernadette O'Hara is late also. Has anyone seen her this morning? I know she was with you last night. Maxwell? Miss Wainwright? That's true, Mrs. Patterson. We waited for her at the inn, but she never showed up. Well, I will get to the bottom of it. Good morning, professor. So, finally comes peace. Now, class, enough time wasted. Gather over, please. This morning, a treat. The galvanic response of the nervous system. You recall the electrostatic generator, the galvanic probe, and, finally, frogs' legs. Wonderful fried, la franaise. By applying the electrical charge of the galvanic probe to the nerve in the frog's leg, Galvani induced muscle contraction, as though the leg were alive. What's so funny? Yes, Mr. Van Der Pall, quite the comedian. But the really funny thing about static electricity is that it can be discharged. Now, let's get serious. Power, please. I apply the probe to the nerve of the frog's leg. Doctor? Doctor! Why is she doing that? A random discharge, Mr. Wainwright. The brain tissue is rebuilding itself. There's no way of knowing whether the new tissue will function normally or not. In the past year, we've had marvellous results with the new technique. The principle is sound, and I think we'll succeed with Virginia. In fact, we are succeeding. Then why isn't she conscious? She's been like this for months. She only moves when you turn on that goddamn machine. Dr. Feinblum, her alphas are up again. I'll switch out. What's happening? Virginia, can you hear me? My... ...birthday. I was an experiment, David. Just like that frog in the lab. The principle is very simple. When a salamander loses its tail, it grows a new one. And Dr. Feinblum found that when this happens, the salamander's nervous system creates a kind of electric field around the site of the wound. So what he did was, he developed this apparatus which reproduced this field in human beings. And this field brought about a regeneration and a healing of broken bones, damaged tissue, and internal organs. And brain cells. You were the first. A guinea pig. Yes, but a very successful guinea pig. What you remembered today proves it. You see, Virginia, Dr. Feinblum was convinced that your brain tissue had been restored by his treatment. - And today I remembered. - Yes. And tomorrow you will remember more. - Even the...? - Even the accident. You know, I'm not saying it's going to be easy. Some of the memories may be very painful. That's why you've repressed them. But you will remember, Virginia, and you will be complete. It's scary. Yeah. I won't let anything or anybody hurt you. No, I won't. See you. Good night, Ginny. Come on, Etienne! Come on, Etienne! Come on, baby! This is your match! Do it, baby! You can do it! Take it home! Take it home! Take it home! Come on, you bastard! We've got 50 bucks on you! Come on! Go! Boogie down, baby! Boogie down! You did it! That was fantastic! Did you wipe that mother out! - At 4 to 1, we made 200 bucks. - 200 bucks? - We are rich! - This calls for a celebration! The Silent Woman! You've got it! But first I have to clean up my bike. - Well, we'll meet there tonight. - What time? Seven o'clock. - Okay, see you then. - Bye. Bye-bye. It's too bad Bernadette wasn't here to see you win. I had to win. I was carrying this next to my heart. - God, you've got a lot of nerve. - That's not all I've got. Want to see? What the hell are you looking at? God, that Etienne. What a mover. No wonder Bernadette took off. Are you kidding? She loves it. Don't you know that they've taken a room in some seedy motel and are doing it every night? Oh, come on! They are not. How do you know? My sweet, innocent Virginia, I've got a lot to teach you. Guys, no answer at Etienne's. You think he'd come to his own celebration. And where the hell is Alfred? He's on a new biology project. He stuffs students. Come on, you guys. He's your regular all-American boy. Ghoul. All-American ghoul. Come on, Steve. He's not that bad. I think these girls like Alfred. I think they would like to be stuffed by Alfred. Why don't you get stuffed, Rudi? God, you're gross. Just piss right off, Maggie, okay? Rudi, Maggie, look. You've got to quit this bickering back and forth, all right? Now, come on. Kiss and make up. Well, there's no problem there. Come on, let's party. The night's young. For God's sake, what's this all about, Ann? I don't want to see Alfred. He's probably still in the lab stuffing something. Stuffing what, I wonder. He has been acting very odd lately. Just go around back and keep watch, okay? Fooled you. Jesus Christ! You just scared the shit out of me. Is he in? No, and the door's locked. But there is a window that's open. So? So, why don't we go in there and see what evil deeds Alfred's been up to? - Do you need a hand? - Yes. Quiet. God, this place is almost as weird as he is. You think he really stuffs all these things? Who knows? - Ann, let's get the hell out of here. - Courage, my dear. What is it? I don't know. There's only one way to find out. No! Oh, God! Oh, Jesus! Window. What are you doing here? We were worried because you didn't show up at the inn. You were worried about me? Worried... ...about me? Maybe you were worried about Bernadette. What about poor little Bernadette? How do you like her? My latest masterpiece. She is a masterpiece, isn't she? I'm very proud of her. And I'll tell you something. If you're both very good, you can be my next models. I think you'd be good models. Oh, Jesus, Alfred. You might think this is a joke, but I think it's sick. Watch it. She's on the warpath. Virginia, you're next. Hey, wait for me. Just a moment, please. Come in. No, no, of course not, Mr. O'Hara. I don't want to alarm you unduly, but there's still no word of Bernadette. Are you sure you have no inkling where she could possibly be? Yes, Mr. O'Hara. Of course I realize she is my responsibility also. Certainly. I will call you tomorrow. Bye. Well, Miss Wainwright. I have to tell you that I do not for one moment believe that two of the Top Ten could disappear without the rest of you being in on the joke. Mrs. Patterson, really, I have no idea where they are. Virginia, I know that in some ways you are a special case. It must have been hard for you to come back to Crawford. I knew your mother, you know. Well, after all, she was a local girl. Virginia, your father is a very wealthy man, and I'm afraid that is the beginning of the trouble. You and all your gang, you think that because you are rich you can sneer at people who've had to work hard, people who've had to fight to get a decent education, that you can do just as you please. But I'm afraid it doesn't work like that. At least not at Crawford Academy. For now, I'm going to assign you to after-school duties. Please report to Mr. Muncie at three o'clock. We'll see if a little detention doesn't jar your memory. Yes, Millie. What is it? Ambassador Vercours on line one. It's about Etienne. So, did she give you the same horseshit? What a bitch. How are we supposed to know where everybody is? And what they're up to. Well, I already know what they're up to. It's just where that has me stumped. I just hope they're all right. It is kind of weird, vanishing like that. Yeah, I know. You want to go to the movies tonight? The film society's showing High Noon. We can get the whole gang to go. Sounds great. I love Gary Cooper. - Cooper is the best. - I agree. But Zinnemann is so fabulous! Every time I see a Western, they put grease in their hair. Hi, Rudi. You missed a great movie. Yeah? Well... It seems like someone didn't bother to ask me to come along. Come on, Steve, let's go. Maggie, I want to have a word with you. - Have a word with her later. - Steve, get out of the way. Take it easy. She's with me. I said get out of the way! Rudi, come on! Come on, lighten up! You touch me again, I'm going to kill you! Hey, come on. Let's all go have a drink, okay? Look, why don't you guys just go to fucking hell? Let's go, Maggie. We're all falling apart. Come on. I'll take you home. Now, Alfred, you can buy me that drink. Come on, Ann. Amelia? It's you. Amelia's coming over with some stuff. She should be here any second. Hey, do me a favour. Slap on ten more, huh? I guess I should have minded my own business tonight, huh? Amelia says we're falling apart, and I'm starting to agree with her. That was kind of easy. How about two more 25s? I just don't understand it. We've been together for such a long time. All of a sudden, we're at each other's throats. Make sure you tighten it, huh? Okay, that's it. What are you doing? Come on, put them back. Come on! Quit screwing around! Come on, please put them back! For God's fucking sake, put them back! God, please. I can't hold it. It's not a joke anymore. Please. I can't hold it. Hey, Greg! Pizza delivery girl. I've got one all dressed with anchovies. Greg. Greg? Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill, kill, kill them! Kill them! - Come on! - Rudi! Go, Rudi! - 2 to 10 says we'll never make it. - You've got it. Come on, guys. We're running out of time. This way! - I've got it! - Give him a head shot! Oh, God. Oh, God. Give me a break. Don't worry. Greg wouldn't take off in the middle of the night without telling me. We sure could use him now. All right! Thank you. Give me one more! Come on, baby! Come on, Rudi! No, no, no! Not now! That's five. One more. Come on. Thank you. Rudi, you were great. That goal was just terrific. Yeah, sorry I was such a jerk last night. That's okay. Are you doing anything later on? No. Well, I'll tell you what. I'll meet you at the chapel. Okay. You cannot refuse. You must follow me into the tower. That smell! The putrescence of decay. But fear not, my little darling, for although we are doomed to die, we shall live forever in the ranks of the undead. Rudi, you stop that right now or I'm not going to go another step. I'm sorry. I can't resist in a place like this. Yeah, it's creepy, all right. You've never been up here before, have you? You know, I keep on forgetting that you're new here at Crawford. No, I'm not. I was here before you. Oh, yeah? When? Four years ago. That's funny. How come nobody ever mentioned it? Well, it was just for a few weeks, but... They've all forgotten me. I will never forget you, my darling. Rudi! I just love this place! I swear. I feel just like Quasimodo. Quasimodo in a bell tower! Thank God you don't look like him. Give me a little kiss, Esmeralda. A little peck on the cheek. Rudi, stop it. Stop it! Next thing I know, you'll be swinging from the bell rope. - That's not a bad idea. - Rudi, are you crazy? Virginia... ...you know, if I cut this bell rope almost all the way through... No. Rudi, no. Virginia... ...I've got a knife. Virginia... ...don't go away. Come over here, Virginia. Jesus! Help. Murder! - Is Dr. Faraday in his office? - Probably. Let me check for you. Roll for the flap. Fishhook. Drill is next. Irrigation, please. Craniotome. Free bone flap. Are her vital signs stable? Yes. She's breathing well, and her blood pressure is stable. - The brain is swelling. - I'll hyperventilate her. Cerebral oedema. She's finished. Close her up. Now, close her! She's dead! Jesus, no! Stop! Somebody, stop him! God, don't let him do it! Somebody, help me! He killed part of my brain. He killed part of me! Virginia, you've remembered the operation. It's coming back piece by piece. The knife. The blood. The operation, Virginia. No! It was today! It was today! Don't you see? I was with Rudi! We were in the bell tower, and he had a knife! I was so scared. And then what happened? I don't know. I panicked! I came here! God, I thought you'd help me! Come here. Come on, Virginia. Come on. You need some rest. I'm going to take you home. All right? Listen, I'll check out the bell tower. Don't you worry about a thing. Right now I'm taking you home. Come on. Come on. It's all right. It's all right. According to Tracy, head of the investigation, two more students have disappeared. Lieutenant Tracy refuses to confirm or deny that police believe the incidents are related. Also missing is Etienne Vercours, a French citizen on an exchange program at the Crawford Academy. He is the son of Ambassador Adrienne Vercours. The third missing student is Gregory Hellman, the son of Nathaniel Hellman, Chairman of the Trans-Allied Finance Corporation. In other news, police are investigating a mysterious incident at Crawford Chapel yesterday. Vandals severed the bell tower rope. But with the discovery of a bloodied knife, police are looking further into the matter, believing foul play may be involved as well. In sports, the five-game unbeaten streak of the Houston... Yes, sir, they're in the library. When did you last see Greg Hellman? I saw him the night before last. We went to the show together. Just give me your name, rank, and serial number. It was an anonymous phone call. That's why they're digging. Christ, every day someone else is missing. - Where the hell is Rudi? - Why are you worried? The other night, you wanted to kill him. They think that Greg may be dead. Okay, that's all. - David. - Virginia, come here. I want to talk to you. David, I'm so scared. Rudi is missing. Listen, it's very important that you tell me exactly what happened in the bell chapel yesterday. Well, I went with Rudi. We went up to the church. Dr. Faraday, is anything the matter? Sir, you'd better come outside. Hey, everybody, I think they found something outside! What is it, Bobby? What is it? Please, let us through! Let's move it on back here. Hi, there. Where have you been? Where have I been? Where have you been? What happened to you yesterday? - Yesterday? - In the bell tower. I nearly cut my hand off with that lousy rope. Fifteen stitches. You creep! You had me believing... It was all a joke. - You didn't tell anybody, did you? - Tell anybody? They've been turning the school upside down looking for you and the others. They're even out there right now, digging in the garden. I was afraid to say anything. Oh, dear God! Lieutenant, do you mind if I take a look at that? Go right ahead, Dr. Faraday. Thank you. I think you should have another look at this. "Property of Crawford Academy Science Department. " What did he say? Here. Rudi. Virginia! - Rudi, I thought that was you. - I'm prettier than that. You're still a bastard. Listen, David, please don't say anything about this to anybody. I don't want to get Rudi in trouble. No, I'm not going to say anything to anybody, but I... I must admit, some of your friends have a macabre sense of humour. I just hope these kids aren't having an adverse effect on you. They're not. Listen, my birthday's Sunday, and I'd like to invite you to dinner. Why, I'd be delighted. Virginia! I've got to run. Thanks, David. Come on, let's go. Old lady Patterson, she was really out for blood today. And Maggie! I thought she was going to tear your balls off after she got over that joyous reunion. Well, it all worked out for the best. Now I can take Virginia to the dance. Can't I, sweetheart? By the way, where's Alfred? God, not Alfred too. Maybe we should all put in 20 bucks, and the last one left takes all. No, you see, Alfred is not a "disappear-er. " He's a "disappear-ee. " A "disappear-ee"? I can just see him walking through the woods, stalking out his latest victim. Get serious, you guys! I haven't seen him since this morning. Nor have I. How about you, Ginny? Have you seen the phantom taxidermist? Virginia! Virginia! Virginia! Yeah, I'm watching it right now. Now, look. Red and his crew are on their way up from Houston. I expect you to give them all the cooperation you can. Is that clear? All right. I'll be in Calgary in approximately four hours. A jet's standing by. I want a chopper at the other end. Thank you. - How long will you be gone, Daddy? - It's hard to say, honey. As long as it takes to get the damn thing out. What about Sunday? Sunday? My God. Your birthday. Hey, glummy face. Look. I'll be back, Ginny. I'll be back by Sunday afternoon. I promise. - You really promise? - I promise, honey. I'll tell you what. If you could find time in your busy social schedule to put on some fancy duds, we'll go out on the town and celebrate, just the two of us. And you know something? Your old dad will show you some of his most incredible, astonishing, fancy footwork. - What do you say? - Okay. I've got to go. You'll be all right here on your own. Why don't you call a friend, invite them over? - I can always call David. - Right. See you Sunday. Happy birthday. - Have you seen Alfred? - No. Four down. Six to go. - Come on, it's not funny. - Who's laughing? The cops are out there, dragging the canal looking for bodies. Rudi, you've got to do me a favour. Go dance with Maggie. - Whose idea is this? - Hers. She's driving me nuts. - Well... - It's fine with me, Rudi. I don't care who knows it. I'm scared. Don't worry about it. I'll take you home. - Let's get out of here. - Aren't you having a good time? Sure, but we could be having an even better time. Really? How? We could go for a drive, have a toke. Just the two of us? Just the two of us. Shame on you, Steve. What would my father say? Luckily, he's away for the weekend. I make real good midnight snacks. You hungry? Am I hungry? Meet you outside. Ann, what time are you coming over tomorrow? About noon, okay? See you. Wait. - Where are you going? - My place. - With Steve? - Yeah. Smells good. What's that? I'm making yours nice and spicy. - I like it spicy. - Good. Thank you. Don't you like hot things? Some hot things. God, am I ripped! My ass is burning. Delicious. Well, have some more. - What time is it? - Past noon. Come on, it's time to get up. I want to hear all the gory details about you and Steve last night. Last night? What the hell was last night? I don't remember anything. Bullshit. Just a minute. I'll be right back. Here are the keys. Come on up. I'm going to take a shower. Mommy, it doesn't matter. Never. I'll never forget this. They don't know how it hurts. But they'll learn! - But Daddy says... - Never mind what Daddy says! Where is he when we need him? Mommy, be careful! Crazy son of a bitch! Mommy, the bridge! Mommy, watch out! Watch out! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Back up! Hurry! Mommy, we have to get out! The water's rising! - We have to get out! - We can still get out. You can swim. Take a deep breath, and I'll open the window. Mommy, I can't! I'm afraid! I can't! Virginia, do what Mommy says! Go on, now. Take a deep breath and swim to the surface. Do it! Go! David! David, help me! Help me! God, help me! David! David, help me! David, I killed her. I killed her. She's upstairs. She's in the bathroom. I killed her. All right, come on. Come on! You come on! You show me! She's upstairs? You show me, you hear? Come on! I don't want to see her! Stop! Look! Look! Look! Look at this. Look! Here. This should warm you up. Thanks. You know, we're coming very close, Virginia. You see, tonight you remembered the accident at the bridge. That's where it all started. But, David, I don't understand. Why would I think I killed Ann? It may be very painful, but, you see, we've got to find the link between your trauma and your friends. The bridge. The kids play chicken on the bridge as it goes up. They call it a game. And they took you over the bridge? Is this all a game? Is it? Well, I think I better stay here until your father gets home. Okay. It's my birthday. It's after twelve o'clock. So it is. Happy birthday, Virginia. Happy birthday. Hi, Doc. Is Virginia Wainwright at home? She hasn't been feeling very well. She's sleeping. We're investigating the disappearance of Miss Ann Thomerson. We found her car abandoned just across the road. She hasn't been seen since yesterday. Her parents are away. The only information we have is that she was on her way over here. Yes. Well, I've been here all weekend. I know that Miss Wainwright has not had any visitors. I would like to ask Miss Wainwright some questions. Suppose I have her give you a ring when she wakes up. Is that all right? Okay, fine. Here's my card. Doc, almost stole your paper. Yes, thank you. Virginia, the police were just here, and they found Ann's car. She's missing. - Oh, my God! Then I did kill her! - Listen. Wait, just a minute. She's missing. That's all. They're all just missing. David, I don't understand. What does it all mean? I think it means that it's locked up in your past, and you've got to try to go back. What do these people have to do with the whole thing? Alfred, Steve, Greg, Bernadette, Etienne. What happened before the accident? You've got to try to remember. It was my birthday. Mother decided to have my party in the cottage. Bernadette O'Hara, Etienne Vercours, Steve Maxwell, Alfred Morris, Greg Hellman, and Ann Thomerson. Six of the richest. Nothing but the best for my little girl. It's almost five o'clock. Did you tell them to come at 4:00? Yes, Mommy. I suppose this is what they call "fashionably late. " Shit! Estelle, I've been trying to call you all day. I can't get home until the weekend. Would you tell Ginny? - I'll make it up to her. - Tell her yourself, you bastard! It's your loving father. Happy birthday, sweetheart. Daddy, where are you? I'm still in Caracas, honey. Daddy, I wanted you here so much. I know. I tried, sweetheart. I just can't get away. Now, tell me. How's the party? Are your friends from school there? Yes. Yes, they're all here. I wanted you to meet them. And I will, Ginny. Believe me. When I get back, we'll have another party. Promise? I promise. Goodbye, sweetheart. Goodbye, Daddy. Why did you say that, Virginia? That your friends were here? I didn't want him to feel bad. Your father's never kept a promise in his life. Where are they, your little friends from the Crawford Academy? They're not coming. What? There's a party at Ann Thomerson's house. I heard them talking. Why didn't they invite you? Mom, they don't even know me! Those goddamn little snots! We'll show them. If they won't come to our party, we'll go to theirs. Open this gate! Open this fucking gate! Is that you, Estelle? What's the trouble here? My daughter's going to that party! - Has she been invited? - She doesn't need an invitation! Hell, Pete, it's her birthday. All those kids are her friends from school. You can send your little girl to the Crawford Academy, but that ain't going to change who you are. You get Will Thomerson down here. Let him tell me that to my face! Those things are over and done with. Don't bring them up now. Just take your little girl and go home. God damn you! I'm a rich woman now! And I'm back to shove it in their faces! You hear me, Will Thomerson? I can't be bought off ever again! Mommy. Mommy, please don't cry. It doesn't matter. Please don't cry. Let's go home. You don't understand. Those stuck-up assholes. They think they own the world. They're going to pay for this! We're going to make them pay! No, Mother, no! Stop! Ginny! I'm home! Where's my birthday girl? Ginny! Ginny, where are you? The plane was late. Jesus God! Jesus God! Not my baby. Please, God, not my baby! Baby! My God, Estelle. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Baby. Baby. Oh, God! Daddy. You kept your promise to me. You came to my birthday party. That's better. Now, would Daddy like a big piece or a little piece? Ginny, baby. What have I done to you? I had no choice. The doctors were so sure. So sure. Bastard! And now for you, bitch. My poor dear little sister. We can't have you looking all dirty. Not for your own birthday party. Now... ...take a look. Take a good long look. I've done it all for you, sister, dear. Since I ruined your last party, I've made certain nothing's going to go wrong this time. With everyone's help, they're all here, just as you always wanted. All seated around the table, waiting to celebrate your birthday. Your precious birthday. And as a special treat, they all get to watch you die. Murder... ...then suicide. Now they'll all know just how crazy little Ginny really was! Surprised? I hope you are. I planned it so you'd never suspect a thing. None of them did. I dressed like you, walked like you. I even talked like you. You made it all so easy for me. I was your best friend. You trusted me. I could come and go as I pleased. You woke up remembering nothing. It worked every time. That night in the cemetery with poor little Alfred. Genius mask-maker. Remember how he fooled us with Bernadette? You didn't know it, but he had followed you there. And so had I. I did it again after the dance with Steve. He was so stoned, he didn't even notice for a moment it wasn't you. And tonight with David. Hey! That nimrod owes me 20 bucks. - At 4 to 1, we made 200 bucks. - 200 bucks? - We are rich! - This calls for a celebration! The Silent Woman! Say hi to George. Hi, George. And now it's your turn. You deserve to die. You're just like her. A fucking whore! My father's mistress. And you're his daughter. My sister. Something she never let my father forget. That's why my mother left us. She could never forgive him for having you. It's all your fault. You've ruined our lives. You should've died that night at the canal. You never should've been born! Dear God! What have you done?
