Probably. You know, I always wanted to play college football. Well, you just needed someone to believe in you. You needed a sar-bear. Sarah! Where have you been? Oh, my god. That's my old roommate. Cheryl! Hi! Good to see you. Are you coming back to school? I am, in the fall. In the meantime, I'm just working hard and saving my pennies. What are you doing on campus? I'm just going to show Rick some of our old haunts. Hello, boys. Hope we're not interrupting your studies. Two bags. How's our inventory? Getting low. Dime. Come here. We made more today Than you used to make in a month. And once we expand into other frats And all the other colleges in the area... We'll be rolling in it. People mess up because they get greedy. You and I are gonna be smart. We're gonna invest in mutual funds. Ah, I like the way your mind works. I love the way your body works. Here? Are you crazy? For you. Next fall, You'll be back at Purdue with all these smart douche-bags. I don't want them. I need you. You're my big, strong papa bear. Damn it, Rick. I'll talk to him. I said they could be here a few weeks. They've been here four months. When are they going back to Vegas? I'll talk to him. I want them gone. Dude? I love that song. The neighbors are gonna call the cops. The neighbors are customers. They're not calling anybody. - What's with the coke? - Business opportunity. The guy I buy from sold it to me for three "g"s. Cut... It'll net 10. Hey! You guys are finally back. Have a line. Catch up with us, sar. You're so full of crap, drew. Seven grand? How much have you shoved up your nose? Eat me. In your dreams. Hey, somebody needs a drink And a hit and a line. Drew! What happened To the music, man? I want this crap out of my house. Okay. So help us get rid of it. Hey! Come and dance with us. Get off of me! Oh, god. You're so boring. Forget it, Trish. They'd rather play with themselves. I'm gonna go to bed soon. You wanna come with me? In a bit. In a bit! Come on! It sucks being the only one with a real job. Oh! Where is it, drew? Chill, Sarah! Stay out of this, Trish! What's going on? He stole my money! My Purdue money! $2,500! I borrowed it to buy the coke. That was my tuition money, you ass! Shut your bitch up, Rick, before I do. - I'm gonna kill that bitch! - Stay down, drew! Stay down! Stay down! Outside. Outside! Hey. Hey! That money is my everything! Rick, it's my future. You said you'd always protect me. Okay. Okay. I'll handle it. You need to calm down. I'm gonna go get some cigarettes. I'll be back in 15 minutes. Okay. Okay. Let papa bear handle this. Rick? Rick? Rick! What did you do? Drew went for the gun. I... it happened so fast. He... he was gonna kill me. Oh, my god. He took your money, Sarah, all right? I- I had to get it back. I had to get your money back. He went for the gun! But what about Trish? Why did you shoot Trish? She came at me! I don't know! It just happened so fast! Did you call the cops? No, no, no. They'll never believe a guy with my record. I've already got two strikes against me. This is self-defense, though, right? It doesn't matter. Okay, all right, I- I-it's just like you always said, right? We need a plan, so, we'll, you know, We'll, uh... We'll get rid of the bodies, And we'll clean up the mess, And we'll go away till this all blows over. Go get the blankets from the bedroom. I can't, Rick, I can't. Damn it, Sarah, go! We have to move! Go to work. You gotta act normal. Nothing's ever gonna be normal again. I'd die for you, Sarah. I won't let anything happen to you. Early this morning, Both shot to death and wrapped in blankets, We found inside a trash dumpster Behind the local... The woman, who authorities say was in her 20s, Remains unidentified. The police have identified the man, Who has multiple tattoos, As 29-year-old Drew Cataldi, A drug dealer with prior convictions, From Nevada. Well, we're currently looking for witnesses, Anyone who might have seen or heard anything. That anyone with information about this crime, Or has seen something suspicious... I got us a room At a motel about 15 minutes from here. We'll get rid of the bloody stuff On the way. You're driving around with it? Well, I couldn't leave it at the house! Oh, my god. - I want to call my dad. - No! No one can know about this. He'll know what to do, Rick! He'll help us. Let's just go. If we drive straight through, We can be in Seattle in less than two days. Okay, baby. If that's what you want, that's what we'll do. Did you pay for this room with your credit card? I didn't have any cash on me. We've gotta get outta here! This is Anderson P.D. We have the motel surrounded... Okay, baby, we gotta stick together. Okay? We're all we've got. I love you. I love you, too. So... We recovered the shotgun From the motel room. I have told you three times already, Rick put it under the bed. And then we went to the sporting goods store Where the gun was purchased and... They have a credit card receipt With your signature on it. You bought the gun. Rick told me to. You see how it looks? Rick had told me That there was something about his past That wouldn't allow him to buy it. He wanted a shotgun! Just the day before the murders, He decides that he's got to have a gun? I- I don't know. It- it wasn't planned. Did Rick Hull tell you why he shot Ms. Nordman? Self-defense. Self-defense? Self-defense explains one shot, to drew, But how do you explain the other two? And how do you explain A 110-pound woman threatening A guy who's almost 200 pounds and armed with a shotgun? Why do I have to explain? I wasn't there! You didn't go to the police. I was scared. Rick manipulated me. Oh, did he threaten you? Did he hurt you? No. And then when he dropped you off, You could've told someone, anyone. You had all day. I was scared! I didn't know what to do. I'd never seen a carcass before. I think... That you wanted to get rid of Cataldi. - That's why you bought the gun. - No. Sarah, let me tell you how I think this went down. I think you waited till Rick got really messed up. This is insane! You're gonna do it my way or we're done! Okay. You said you'd always protect me, now prove it! She can't live. You're twisting everything! Rick killed them. Because you made him do it. That is a lie! I wasn't there! I went for cigarettes! No one saw you. There's no cigarettes, there's no receipt. I changed my mind, it was late. I got scared, I decided to go back home. Trish is my friend. Well, who refers to their friend as a "carcass?" Sarah Pender, You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can, and will be, Used against you in a court of law. Hello. You're that chick they say killed her roommates. You and your boyfriend threw 'em in a dumpster. Could you give it a rest, okay, Roxanne? Ignore her, honey. Oh, great. Great. Look what you did. Huh? People who live in sin Shouldn't throw stones, 'kay? Well, that don't even make any sense. Oh, no, honey, look. You're gonna be fine. Okay? It's not that bad here. Why don't you just get some rest? Use the phone, daddy. Sarah... Are you okay? What are you doing here? I got here as soon as I could. Oh, daddy... It's gonna be okay. This is a sick misunderstanding. I've hired an attorney. I want to go home with you. Yes. When this nightmare is over, You're coming home. I don't belong in here. When are they gonna let me out? They're charging you with a double murder, Sarah. There is no bail. I'm sorry. There's nothing to be afraid of, okay? Arraignments are simple. Your lawyer's gonna enter your plea. You won't have to speak. I wish you could be there. Jamie Long, let's go. You just made bail. Yeah. Can I have a minute to say goodbye? I don't think I can do this. Listen to me. You need to think positive things. All right? Like that old song. Raindrops and roses, and kitten-whiskers, And puppy-breath? You're crazy. You're gonna be all right, honey. This nightmare is gonna be over really soon, And I'll bring you whatever you want- Books, candy, whatever. I'll never forget this, Jamie. To be sweet, innocent, likable... But lurking within her is a demon With the ability to seduce another To commit the most atrocious act. She's like a female Charles Manson. This whole trial's just a farce. Things that they're accusing her of doing, My baby is not capable of. If anyone was manipulating anyone, It's that boyfriend, Richard Hull. He's the one with the criminal record. Doesn't matter what they say about me. Sarah. Last night, during a sweep of Mr. Hull's cell, They discovered a letter. A letter from Rick? A letter to Mr. Hull from Sarah. I haven't written any letters to Rick. "My dearest Richard," "I love you and I miss you so much." "I wish I could go back" "and change the events of that night." "maybe it was all the pot we smoked, or the booze, but I just snapped." "I'm sorry I lied about not being there." "Love always, your lady bear." That is a lie! I... I didn't write that. I wasn't there when Rick shot them! I went for a walk! This... this is not my handwriting! You... You have to believe me, Mr. Brady. Rick is lying. I don't have to believe you, Sarah, the jury does. They have already heard That you bought the murder weapon And that you helped Mr. Hull dispose of the bodies. This letter is very damaging. Sarah Pender was found guilty of two counts of homicide And sentenced to 50 years for the murder of Mr. Cataldi, And 60 years for Ms. Nordman, Sentences running consecutively for 110 years. I'm superintendent Rogers. You may call me "ma'am" or "Ms. Rogers." Yes, ma'am. Well, Sarah Pender... You're home. Life at Rockville is structured. No one gets special treatment. We do count twice a day- 8:50 a.m., and at 3:50 in the p.m. Unless you're at your job, in a classroom, or in the infirmary, every offender must be in her cell on her bunk For count. Name's Corinne. You're up top. Do not step on my bed getting up or down. Do not kick me. We clean on Sunday. And don't ask no stupid questions. Hey! What part of "do not step on my bed" Don't you understand? Want me to come up there and beat you down On the first day in? Hey. I'm Mimi. But everybody calls me "Mimi." Forgery, selling fake I.D.S, But my lawyer says I'll only do 18 months, So I've got, like, nine to go. Do you want to hang out sometime? I'm friends with your cellie, Corinne. Do you know she poisoned two husbands? She did. Okay. Tsk. Sarah Jo Pender, get over here! I thought you forgot about me. Oh, my gosh, no. What'd I tell you? The first day you could have visitors, I would be here, with bells on. So, sunshine... How you doing? Uh, it's okay. I'm reading, sleeping a lot. What about friends? Sarah... Your father has hired an attorney Who specializes in appeals. Yeah, I didn't get adequate representation. We're going to get you out of here, But it's going to take time. You've got to realize that. I'm not gonna make it in here. Yes, you will. Now, listen. Time's gonna go a whole lot faster If you don't just sit around feeling sorry for yourself. Do we understand each other? Sarah? Look at me. You've gotta do your part. Excuse me. Sorry. Hey. Hi. I'm Farrell. I was hoping you could tell me what this means. I'm busy right now. Sorry. Please? No one'll help me, And someone said You're the smartest girl in here. It's something to do with my kids. It's a petition for guardianship. They want to take your kids away. Who? I'm a good mom. I've made some mistakes, But I'm a good mom. Who are Gladys and George Brenner? My aunt and uncle. I asked them to watch the girls until I get released. They're asking the court to terminate your parental rights And name them legal guardians. Can they do that? Let me see what I can do. ? daisy, daisy? ? give me your answer, do? Shut up! It's a free country! ? I'm half crazy? ? all for the love of you? Girl, you are full-on crazy. Some people just have no appreciation of music. She speaks. ? daisy, daisy? ? give me your answer, do? Well, if it isn't miss Charlotte Manson. Happy Halloween. Cocktail? Oh! What the hell is this? Mimi's specialty- "cafe karma." Little bit of sugar, coffee and dihexadryl. Gets you a nice caffeine-sugar antihistamine buzz, And your nose won't run for a week. They let you have dihexadryl in here? No! I got a friendly guard who helps me get it. By "friendly," She means she rocks his world every other week. Ga-bown! Ga-bown! You know what I'm saying? They never notified you about A hearing to determine parental rights. How could I have gone to a hearing? I was locked up in here. Doesn't matter. According to the law, The state mandates That both parents must be notified Of parental termination, Unless their whereabouts are "unknown." Do they know your whereabouts? You think? That's why they're trying to take my kids from me. Well, they blew it. We're gonna get your kids back, Farrell. Come give your dad a hug. Oh! I didn't think I'd get a visit until christmas. God, I miss this. Hugging you. How are you? I'm fine. I'm not gonna let them get me down. Most people in your situation would've given up. What's wrong? The appellate court denied your appeal. Didn't find anything wrong with Mr. Brady's representation. But... Okay. Okay, this is just a setback. I've already done two years for a crime I didn't commit. I'm fighting a system That won't admit it made a mistake. There are all sorts of appeals I can make. Harsh and excessive punishment, insufficient evidence. If they want a fight, they're gonna get one. What? You would've made a great lawyer. You've got such a sharp mind. I'm going to find something, some way to get out of this. The thing is... I'm short on cash. That's okay, daddy. Okay? You've done enough. Just please don't give up on me. Never, baby. Never. We got to get your guy To bring in more dihexadryl, And you've gotta stop giving it away. These girls are hooked. They're gonna pay a lot to get a buzz on. But there's no money allowed in here. The money stays on the outside- Money orders. Someone on the outside cashes 'em, Opens up a bank account. Maybe we can even save enough To get you singing lessons. Mooney v. Holohan. Mooney had been pardoned When he proved he'd been convicted On the basis of evidence known by the state to be false. Like Jamie Long told you on the phone, Mr. Cook, Rick wrote to me that he had a change of heart. My supposed "confession letter" was fake. They have to let me out, Or at least give me a new trial. To get post- conviction relief, You can't just show That some of the evidence against you was false- You have to show reasonable innocence. I am innocent. It's a long shot. It's my only shot. You're gonna need Mr. Hull to sign an affidavit Stating that he forged that letter. Rick will do anything to help me. Okay, this is your last chance To have your conviction overturned, Ms. Pender. It could take a couple of years, Which means a lot of time. I'm expensive. Don't worry. I'll get you your money. You need to talk to your guy. He quit. He can't quit. He's in too deep. He's gone. He doesn't work here anymore. Well, we need to find a new mule. Sarah... I can't risk it. I'm getting out in a few weeks. You're right. We can't do anything to jeopardize your release. I understand. Mr. Cook has agreed to let me pay his retainer A few hundred bucks at a time, But ben and me are tapped out. Do you want me to call your father? No, no. I've cost him enough already. More money will come. I'm exploring some other options. Okay, folks. Visitation hours are over. I love you more than puppy paws. Kindly make your way to the exit. Sweet baby. Time to go. Line it up, ladies. You know, this would go a lot faster If you lent a hand. Okay, write this down. It includes actions for recovery of specific- White, Hernandez, Pender, report to the chemical closet of the rec building For custodian duty. We'll do this later. I had to call in a favor to get you this detail. Hope it's worth it. What makes you think I won't scream? Did you bring a condom? Sorry, no glove, no love. Help! It's Mimi! Something's wrong. Guard! Guard! Look at me. Never forget who helped you. Sarah, look out. Look out, look out, look out. Mimi? Mimi? Can you hear me? Nod if you can hear me. Stacy, go get the medical staff, now. So I talked to Ms. Rogers. Mimi's gonna be okay. They're going to keep her in the infirmary Until she's released next month. Apparently, she had an allergic reaction. Allergic reaction, my ass. I told her that girl, She keep drinking that cafe karma, She gonna kill herself. She's just lucky she had you there to help her. I don't eat meat. Is this really the fight you want to have? Come here. Mm. You must have played sports in high school. Wrestling. What, are you gonna pin me, officer Spitler? Look... Nobody cares if you keep to yourself, But you've got to decide what you care about. You don't know nothin' about my situation. I know about this situation. A few years ago, I was you. You gotta find something to do, You need to get a job, you have to have a plan. It's gonna help pass the time. I'm not gonna work for them. Not for them. For you. I heard they need a new girl in the laundry. I have never felt this way with anyone before. This connection. I walk around with this pit in my stomach. Night-time's the worst. Sometimes, I can't sleep. You know, if you could get me a phone, You could tuck me in at night. We could have phone sex. You have a one-track mind. I know. It's dumb. You can't get me a phone. Baby-doll, I can get you anything you want. Hello? Happy New Year's. It's Sarah. Oh, my God! Sarah? Oh, my... God! Calm down. I only have a minute. I've made a friend- - ...Who's gonna help us. - Who? Someone else who believes in me. I'm gonna text you A list of stuff to buy- Phones, dihexadryl, tobacco. N... Sarah, no, no. I'm not smuggling anything in there. I would never ask you to break the law. Dihexadryl's an over-the-counter antihistamine. I've got it all worked out. I take the orders. The girls get someone on the outside To send a money order to your P.O. Box. You just deposit the money into a bank account, Then you go to one of those chain drugstores. They're gonna have everything on the list. You buy it and you ship it to a different P.O. Box, All legal. Sarah, this is gonna mess with your appeal. This is gonna pay for my appeal. Don't worry. I love you more than Fairy dust on butterfly wings. Happy Valentine's day. You were wrong, Mr. Cook. It only took them one year to review my case. When's my retrial? Your motion was denied. What? But Rick's affidavit- The judge has denied your request for a retrial Based on the other undisputed evidence against you- The shotgun you purchased, The truck you borrowed, Forensic evidence at your house. You're not getting out, Sarah. I'm sorry. You're sorry? I've paid you thousands of dollars! People have made sacrifices for me! No! No! Let go! Let me go! I hope you won't let This monumental disappointment Change your attitude. No, ma'am. I'm not sure you realize What a positive role model you've become. Thank you, ma'am. I'm gonna bring my girls to meet you. No. No, Farrell. You need to forget about me, You need to forget this place, And focus on staying the hell away from here. A picture for your wall. Oh, they're beautiful. I always wanted a big family. Two-storey house, lots of yard, And five or six kids running around. Let's see... I hardly recognize you in those clothes. How can I thank you for getting my kids back? Don't lose them again. They need you. We have to go. Bye. Ah, it's total B.S. You'd think we were criminals or something. That mean we have to ask permission to pee? Hell, they're already all up in our business. Next thing you know, There won't be any nooks or crannies To sneak a smoke or whatnot. What are you talking about? While you were in the lock, We got ourselves a new prison commissioner. A real hard-ass. He's adding "movement accountability" protocols- Cameras everywhere, I.D. Badges, more rules. Shoot. We aren't in our cells or at chow, We gotta present special passes. It's all about bein' "the man." When's this happening? Next week. I only got about 10 minutes. Gonna tell me about the new security? I was. I'm sorry. I'm disappointed, too. You're disappointed? We missed our chance. The window's gonna close. You've just gotta file another appeal. There are no more appeals! Look, we talked about what was gonna happen If I lost my appeal. It's too late. You told me you've never met Anyone who understood you the way I do, Who makes you feel the way I do, But when I really need you... Whoa. There's a door off the gym that isn't alarmed. I checked. It leads to the release area. From there, I've got everything figured out. I'm not gonna grow old in this prison For something I didn't do. Don't do anything stupid, Sarah. We'll get through this. "we?" just get everything together on that list, And be ready. Oh, that's perfect. He give this to you? Yeah. What if they shoot you? At least I'll be wearing cute clothes. Oh, shut up. Come here. What'd I tell you? Huh? I told you not to- You didn't hear- Visiting hours are now over. All visitors will have to report To the office to sign out. Pulling up to the gate. - The gate's open- - Scott! Stop the play-by-play! You kidding? I just needed to gas up before I park it for the day. Take it easy, Spitler. Just make it fast, huh? When am I going to see you again? Soon as it's safe, I'll call you. We can finally be together. Oh, my god! - We got to get outta here! - Whoa! I'm done. 23 hours. Must be some kind of record. Didn't even get the sheets dirty. Of course, half the credit goes to my co-star. This genius breaks out of a maxi Outside of Dayton, And then takes a bus to his baby's mama's house in Gary. I was waitin' for him when he walked in. Sometimes, it's just too easy. Marshal Harlan. I'm on my way. Start the clock, McCorkle. Woman just skipped out of Rockville. So you're gonna be safe here, okay? It's an old foreclosure that me and Ben were cleaning up for the bank. I think you could probably stay safe here for a week. Maybe even two. This is great. We got to cut and color my hair. I cannot believe you're standing here. Whoa. Where's all my stuff? Um, I have to pick it up. I don't know, I mean, I figured I'd have to go on a food run anyway. I told you to get everything ready. Yeah, but look, you got out so fast. Well, can I get my money? Honey... Your money is temporarily unavailable right now. No, no, no, don't worry, we promise, We're gonna pay it back, with interest. What did you do with my money? Ben always wanted a jacuzzi. You-! You used my money to buy a hot tub? He has a bad back. Ohh! You said you'd never let me down. Here, here, here. Look, look, look, look, look. This is $33! I'm gonna go And I'm gonna pick up everything I can for you. Okay? Okay? I love you. Like warm, fuzzy kittens. So between 2:30 and 4:00, You recorded that three prison vehicles Exited the sally port? Two of the exiting vans had offenders Who were being released and transported To the greyhound station downtown, But this third vehicle... Had a driver only? According to your notes, Transpo officer Spitler... Needed to refuel. How well do you know Spitler? Scott Spitler has worked here for five years, Marshal Harlan. He's married, with two small kids. I glanced inside, But Spitler was in a hurry. He's a model guard. He ain't perfect, Ms. Rogers. There've been rumors. What kind of rumors? Soap and water weren't the only fluids They've been mixing in the chemical closet. This is bull! I'm the straightest arrow here. Why did you rush the van inspection When you exited after refueling? Check your records, marshal. Since I've been a trip officer, I've never skipped van inspection. I get it. You're not the kind of guy who flaunts rules. Let's talk about the chemical closet. You say you barely knew Sarah Pender, But according to prison records, You were her supervisor When she was on chemical duty. I supervised a lot of women on chemical duty. I did not do anything wrong with that woman. She had help on the inside, Scott. We have to ask everyone. I know. I know. So, officer Spitler. You didn't do anything wrong with that woman? No. I did not. Did you know, when people lie, They don't use contractions? And they use distancing phrases like "that woman" When they really meant "Monica Lewinski." You're lying. I'm sorry, Ms. Rogers. Scott? Is this true? What the hell were you thinking? I don't know. I was... It just made sense. Sarah, she understood me. She... loved me. She wanted to have my baby. Where is she? I don't know. I swear. Sarah didn't tell me anything. My job was just to get her to the parking lot. Daddy. I'm out. Please don't be mad at me. I tried it their way, but they gave me no choice. I'll be in touch when I can. I love you. I need a list of all the women in the area who did time with Pender. That'll be a long list. I want to speak to her. Told you this was gonna end bad. Said the fat man in the hot tub. Ah, shut it. She's gonna kill me. Jamie Long? Open the door! U.S. Marshal Sean Harlan. Open the door! How can I help you? I'm looking for Sarah Pender. Well, have you tried Rockville prison? Is anyone else in the house? Oh. Yeah. Uh, Ben's... Out back in the jacuzzi. But you don't want to see that. You're not curious why I'm looking for her? Oh, I guess that she's probably missing. Good guess. The guard that helped Pender escape said you drove the getaway car. He didn't see me. No, he didn't. I lied. Jamie, where is she? Sarah didn't kill those people! She's a fugitive now, with a target on her back. But I can bring her in alive. You don't give a rat's ass about Sarah. She's got nothing to lose. You have everything. Aiding and abetting an escaped prisoner is a felony. You've already done the crime. You can't help her anymore. You can only help yourself. Jamie! You tell the man where she is, Or I will. ! Sarah Pender? I need to see your hands. All clear! Marshal, she's not here. We're all clear. Put it on an A.P.B. And get the photos of Pender out on the wires. Start with border control. Alert America's Most Wanted. We got to get her face out there. Your hair. I didn't recognize you. Yeah, that's the point, Mimi. Can you pay for this stuff? It's all over the radio and TV. They've already arrested two people. Things aren't going exactly as planned. I can't get involved. You already are. What do you want from me? I need an I.D. You've got to talk to your guy at the DMV. I'm on parole! I can get you an I.D.. But they're not cheap... Like two grand. Well, do you have any jewelry you could sell? Clothes? Your car? I don't care how you do it, but you owe me. I owe you? Take me to your house. I live with my boyfriend! We can't. I slept on a bus last night. No idea who she might contact, Or where she might be going? Sugar, I'm not even sure What white girl we're talkin' about. Hmm. They all look alike to me. I'm glad she's gone. She deserves it. She's the most beautiful, real thing in here. She's my wife. That's funny, 'cause Spitler said they were in love, too. That's bull. She hated that man. He was screwing other girls before Sarah. That's why she picked him... But she didn't trust him. She kept the used condoms? As insurance, 'case spit-man got any dumb-ass ideas. Where is she, Paula? Got no idea. She didn't tell me Who was helping her on the outside. She didn't trust you. She was protecting me from a-holes like you. Sarah made me believe anything was possible. She loved me for who I am. I never had to pretend with her. Sarah saved my life. Sarah was very popular with the other offenders. She did good things for a lot of them. They loved her. They'll help her now. I'm counting on it. I've been chasing fugitives for 16 years. First thing they all do Is reach back to family and friends. Any of these women been released? Mimi Lundt. Got out last year. Ms. Lundt? I don't know where Sarah is. I didn't mention Sarah Pender. You didn't have to. You're a cop. It's all over the news. So you want to protect her? Protect her? I'm scared to death of her. You're right. We can't do anything to jeopardize your release. No one can, not till I get out. What are you saying? If anyone does anything to mess up my release... I will do what I have to, to protect myself. Help! Help! It's Mimi! Guard! Guard! Never forget who helped you. Do you think she poisoned you? I know somebody put something in my food or drink. I want her back in prison. Hello? Hey. It's Sarah. Don't hang up. You're the last person I want to call right now, But I need your help. So how old are you? Are you coming to my birthday? Well, I'll certainly try. Her birthday's not for a few months. I'm gonna be a princess. Go on, baby. She is really cute. And a handful. Sarah... You gave me my life back. I'm glad I could help you, but- I would never go anything to hurt you or your kids. You have to trust me. But I'm broke, Farrell. I'm gonna need real money to pull this off. I'm willing to do whatever. Well, there's this guy, Bob. I know him from dancing at the club. Okay. She's Manson. She's Gandhi. She's gay... She's straight, She's a blonde, she's a brunette. She's an angel, she's the devil. She uses people, She gets them to do what she wants, Then she discards them. We're getting hits from the A.P.B. A gas station in Ozark, Missouri. A drugstore in Kingman, Arizona. A street corner in Jacksonville, Florida. Let local authorities chase those. These are women in a 200-mile radius Who went through Rockville when Pender was there, More than half of them are strippers and/or prostitutes. Start canvassing the streets and clubs. Someone knows where she is. But be careful. She's in survival mode. Got nothin' to lose. All right, let's get to it. You must be Ashley. And you must be Bob. It was 400, right? Hope you're not in a hurry. How long you been married? 35 years... To life. When did you get divorced? We're still married, actually. He's a cop. We used to be crazy in love, Then he just started going psycho with jealousy. Thought I was flirting with everyone, He hit me a few times. Son of a bitch. I really know how to pick 'em. Excuse me. Sure. Farrell? There are cops at the club. They must know I helped you. No, no, no. They're just fishing. Half the girls at Rockville have stripped there. Just drive away. You know I'll never tell anyone you helped me. You can't come back to my place. I won't. Just take care of your girls. I'll figure something out, okay? Good luck. I'm sorry. Hey. Everything okay? I might need a place to lay my head tonight. Well... Consider yourself home, baby. Can I take a bath? I haven't soaked in a tub for years. Soak away. We've got all night. Okay. I came to Indianapolis to track down Sarah Pender. Pender's a convicted killer Who's been on the run for 72 hours now, And there's no telling what she's capable of next, So if you've seen Sarah Pender, call us at 1-800-crime-TV. She needs to be back behind bars tonight. You're still wearing clothes. And your face is all over TV. You're Sarah Pender. I believed you were in trouble. I am in trouble. - I'm not what they say I am! - No. No. - What did you do? Were you gonna kill me? Turn-down service? No! We're good. Thank you. Just let me go. You can keep your money. I don't want my money. I want you. I know I should've called the cops Right afterwards. I should've told them about Rick. But I did more than enough time For that one mistake, And I wasn't about to do any more. Betty your wife? Well... What are you gonna do now? My plans are... Fluid. Well, let me help you. I'll book the room for another night. I can come here after work tomorrow. And after that? If you really want to help me, Help me get a job... A good job that pays cash. Shouldn't you be thinking about Trying to leave the country? They'll be expecting me to run. Is about the last thing anyone expects me to do. Got any skills? Any other skills? Accounting. Second-oldest profession. In high school, I did the books and payroll For my father's landscaping business. What do you do? Paper goods. Distribution. I own Hopner supplies. So that's like, what? Napkins, cups, plates? Very good. That's cool. You really are something else. Most women don't care about what I do. I get it. It's not a very sexy business. But it's made me rich. Which is sexy. You must be able to think of something I can do with my skills. Her name's Ashley. She's my wife's cousin, But she's in a little bit of a situation. She knows accounting. Okay, I'll start the paperwork. Well, I'd rather keep it off the books for now, So just pay her 10 bucks an hour out of petty cash. I told her she could start tomorrow. Thanks, Jer. Do you trust him? Jerry? Are you kidding me? He's been with me for more than 10 years, He's not gonna say anything to anyone. Okay. Do you know who's helping Sarah? She's out free while Richard Hull, Scott Spitler, and yourself Are behind bars. Sarah is a beautiful person, And what I did for her, I did it because I wanted to do it, okay? I loved her enough to let her go. Do you care if she kills again? She's not a killer! - Hey, Sarah! - Listened to her for years... - Come in here, quick. Her story never changes. You're on America's Most Wanted again. ...Wasn't even there What would you say to Sarah If you could speak with her now? Run, Sarah. Run. Officially added to the U.S. Marshal's Top 15, The only woman on that list. Well, how 'bout that? What do you think of Sarah? Bobby Hopner couldn't get a cheerleader To give him the time of day. And now... I'm sleeping with America's Most Wanted woman. She is a convicted murderer. She knows how to use people. She gets ordinary people to do horrible things, And then she flushes them down the toilet, Just like she flushed those two bodies In the dumpster. So... Do you think I'm ordinary, baby? You're not that special. Oh, really? Just sayin'. For U.S. Marshal Sean Harlan, Bringing in Pender is his top priority, And one he takes very personally. You're gonna make a mistake. When you do, I'm gonna catch you. So if you've seen Sarah Pender, Call us at 1-800-crime-TV. I'll call on this phone when I can. So what do you think of Bali? Well, it says here you can get A better cup of coffee there than you can in Rome. And they have no extradition treaty With the U.S. We deserve to be happy. I'm happy now. Hey, did jerry tell you about the mistake I found In his bookkeeping? What mistake? 50% of your payroll tax remittance Is money withheld from employee pay, Which are wage expenses, not payroll. Jerry's been writing them off as payroll expenses. Crap. Don't worry, honey. I showed jerry his mistake. As long as you pay the back taxes, You won't be audited. Let me do the books at all your warehouses. My wife sits on my board. If she finds out about us, It could cause me a lot of problems. Hey. Why do we have to upset this special thing, huh? I love what we have, But I'm a hunted woman, And you're aiding and abetting a fugitive. It would be in both of our interests To get a plan together, A long-term plan, Otherwise we're just playing a dangerous game of "house." What is it, Jer? I'm a little busy. Bob told me about the accounting mistake you found. I've been doing a little snooping on my own. Bob's wife doesn't have a cousin named "Ashley." Maybe... Maybe we should give her a call. Why don't we? As a member of the board, I'm sure she'd be interested to learn How you've been ripping this company off blind. And I'm not talking your incompetence, I'm talking straight-up embezzlement. Imagine my surprise When I called that glue vendor up in fort Wayne About a check that never cleared, Found out they've been out of business for three years. Any idea who's been forging their signature? Or where that 38-grand went to? So what do you think, jerry? Should we call? I wasn't gonna call the police, but... When I saw America's Most Wanted... I don't want her to get hurt. I can't imagine how difficult this must be For you as a father. She was only three when her mom left, Just took off. I went and got her, Brought her here and raised her. I guess I probably spoiled her. She got me to do whatever she wanted. She never liked the word, "no." I just... I just wanted her to feel loved. She always wanted more. Is Sarah capable Of doing the things she was convicted of? When it comes to surviving... My daughter is capable of doing anything. Daddy? Who is this? Harlan. Don't hang up. How did you get this phone? Your dad. He has nothing to do with this. You dragged him into it when you sent him the phone. That's why he called me. - He called you? - Yeah. Real nice man. Leave my father alone! You're killing him, Sarah. Shut up! Shut up. Tell me where you are. I'll bring you in. Do it for your father. Must be frustrating, marshal Harlan. You got pretty close to me At that motel, but ever since then, whoever's helping you, they know you're a killer. I'm not a killer! So your two roommates shot themselves? Rick is an idiot! If I wanted to kill someone, I wouldn't have shot them in my living room And dumped their bodies around the corner. Then why didn't you call the cops? I just saw my boyfriend kill Drew. Yeah. That would scare anyone. I get it. You saw your boyfriend shoot Drew, Then you saw him shoot... What was her name? I didn't see Rick shoot Trish. I wasn't there. You just said they got a weak hit on two towers off I-80, between Gary and Toledo. She's been in the midwest The whole time. Get on it. Pender just let it slip that she saw her boyfriend kill drew. She's always claimed She wasn't in the house when the killings occurred. Well, does it really matter? It's the first slip-up she's made. When she does it again, I'm gonna be there. She's right here. Gotcha. Where have you been? I've been calling you all night. - Hey, what's wrong? - Everything! That U.S. Marshal's gotten to my dad. Jerry knows I'm not your cousin. I'll handle jerry. All this hiding and pretending. I need to find Someone who can commit to a future with me. Listen. I'm that guy. Okay? We'll start over. I'm gonna make you happy, Sarah. I promise. Wait. Where are we? Keep them closed. Okay... Okay. You can open 'em. You like? I rented it for you. For us. This is amazing. I love it. I love you. You want to go upstairs? I... I can't. Betty's expecting me for dinner. We've got to start implementing our plan, Bob. You can't have everything you want. You've got to make choices. Sarah, I can't marry a fugitive. You can't marry anyone until you get a divorce. Divorces are complicated. Betty could take me for millions. Maybe there's a simpler solution. I know what I want. And I want to be the next Mrs. Robert Hopner, But I'm not gonna wait forever for you to decide. Sorry, marshal. I have no idea where she'd go. After three months on the run, I'm not holding my breath for a call, either. She's been out 4 months. 133 days, but who's counting? The only time Sarah ever communicated with me Since we were arrested Was when she needed an affidavit. She blames that forged letter in getting her 110 years. I was just trying to save my own ass from the needle. The prosecution used it To turn Sarah into the boogeyman. Otherwise, she might've gotten away with it. Gotten away with what? Her role in it. Ease up. Those things'll kill you. Not soon enough. You know, I was happy with what we had... But Sarah always wanted more. Fancy cars? Jewelry? Sarah? You kidding? Nah, she wanted a family. A big family. Six or seven kids. It was all about the kids for her. She wanted to give them The childhood she didn't get to have. Doesn't fit the picture of Sarah in your mind? Guard. So A.M.W. 's going to lead with a Pender update. What's up? Call Rockville. Find out if anyone in Pender's orbit Had three daughters. These kids are very important to her. Who are they? Hey, baby. Hi. So I talked to a plastic surgeon Today, in New York. He can do everything for about 13 grand... Nose, cheek-lifts, chin. A whole new me, in eight hours. Great. We could stay a few extra days. We can make a little honeymoon out of it. I can't wait to have a normal life with you. Me too. Farrell Loman. Who is she? A stripper. She did a nine-month bid for solicitation. Sarah helped her keep her kids. I don't remember the name. She's not on Sarah's call or visitation list, So we missed her. Oh! Look at the pink cupcakes! Just for my baby. You like your pink cupcakes, baby girl? Yeah? Okay, I'll be right back. Can I help you? That's a nice party. I've got a five-year-old, But he's with his mother In Columbus. Sean Harlan. I'm looking for Sarah Pender. I... I don't have any idea. I know she helped you keep custody of your kids. It'd be a shame to lose them now. To you, I'm just some ex-con stripper, But to my girls, I'm mom, And I owe that to Sarah. She dragged you into this, And she's putting you and your kids at risk. She was desperate. Tell me where she is, And I'll keep you out of this, I promise. Your parole officer never has to know. Do it for your daughters. When did you get home? Dinner won't be ready for awhile yet. Opened one of those Napa pinots you like. What's the occasion? We didn't used to need one. Bob Hopner, right? Yeah. Hey. Hey, I know you. How do I know you? Well, maybe you saw me on TV. America's most wanted? Sean Harlan. U.S. Marshals. Fugitive recovery task force. Right. Where is she, Bob? Who? I... I don't know what you mean. I can handcuff you right now and take you inside And do this in front of your wife. My wife's not home. But that's betty's car right there. I ran the registration. So, should we include Mrs. Hopner In this conversation? Okay. Look. I spent one night with Sarah A few months ago. Okay? Look, I'm out on the road a lot. I sometimes like to party with women. I mean, that was it. It was a few months ago, And I haven't seen her since. She didn't tell you who she was, Or what she'd done? No. No, I mean, I didn't realize, Until I saw her face on that most wanted show. Why didn't you call the show? You could've collected the reward. Yeah. Uh... I'm not sure how I would have explained that one to the wife. Right. Most people who come into contact with Sarah Pender And up dead or in jail. Well, I make my own luck, marshal. Thanks for your time, Bob. The arrogant jackass. He knows where Pender is. That's why I'm gonna let him lead us to her. How many cell lines does he have? He's got three. The first one seems strictly business, Mainly 9:00-to-5:00, But the third one never calls His home line or his wife's cell. Lots of calls to Muncie, up until a month ago. The recent activity is all in the Chicago area. I'm going to Chicago. Stay up on all his lines. Hey. You're on TV, right? One of them reality shows? No. Sorry. Baby... You know how much I love you, don't you? I know this hasn't been easy, But we're gonna finally be happy together. I'm going to go get packed. I'll see you tonight. Just call me when you're on the way. The carrier needs to see a warrant first. Mccorkle, we've got a warrant! Fax it to them, get me the damn number. On my personal top 10 fugitive list of the year Currently the only woman on that list. Pender's a double-murderer Who broke out of Rockville prison in Indiana Several months ago. Bob? Get it? Got it. On Clyburn and Fullerton. Puts her about Five miles southwest of downtown Chicago. Slip-up number two. Where do I go? Take Ashland north. Maybe I can put you on a specific street. Gas company. We need to do a meter-reading. Sarah Jo Pender? You got me. Hands on your head. Turn around. Where's marshal Harlan? Who? . Where is she? We're upstairs, sir. Marshal Harlan. Too bad you didn't catch me. Sometimes... It takes a village. Acting on an anonymous tip, top 15 fugitive Sarah Pender, In a rented townhouse On the southwest side of the city. The tipster, who wouldn't leave a name, From an episode of America's Most Wanted, Which aired earlier tonight. Pender will be transferred back to prison In Indiana in the morning. What was it like, Being the most wanted woman in America? Horrible. You can't ever relax. The key is moving forward, It's a waste of time looking back. You did something, you didn't do something, It doesn't really matter. Is what you do now, today, tomorrow. You've got to have goals. A plan... You always got to have a plan. Is that why you started dealing pot with Rick? Rick was small-time. He hardly broke even. Drew was screwing him over, So I... I got the idea that we should branch out. Took him up to Purdue, And that was pretty much the last normal day of my life. I never hurt anyone. I'm a good person. What are you doing? You paint a pretty picture, Sarah. Sweet girl, wrong place, wrong time, But a lot of those other people, they paint a much darker one- Extortion, coercion, manipulation, murder. I'm not a murderer. Tell me the truth about that night. It's not gonna change your situation. You really think I would've planned to kill them In my house with a shotgun I bought the day before? Maybe. Maybe you planned to make it look Like Rick's idea all along. She's still alive! Who would the cops believe? A petty criminal or a pretty physics major? "when it comes to survival, I think Sarah is capable of doing anything." That's a quote from your father. All I know is That you will say, or do, anything To get what you want. You know something, marshal Harlan? You're a lot more handsome in person than you are on TV. You must work out a lot.
