You guys are running late. Shooter, customer. We lost them both on the way. We have to keep going on this one Another one was dead on the scene, a busboy, went straight to the locker. I was just there, 20 minutes ago. - Come on, scrub in. Find your perfect place. It's easy, at Remax. com. Nobody sells more Real Estate than Remax Hey Jimmy, how you doing, man? From our lips to his ear. In the language of our inmost longings. We humbly pray. Hey Jimmy, I'm Ron. It's my job to talk to people after upsetting experiences like accidents or crimes. The doctor who examined you thinks maybe we should get to know each other. I hear you're not saying much. Will you talk to me? Can you shake your head yes or no? Will you write down your answers if I ask you a few questions? When you want to figure out how you feel about what happened will you see me. Light superficial trauma, repercussion when you fell. You may sleep a few days straight. Have some blurs and blanks. One thing is sure. You were some kind of lucky. Beyond lucky. Come on, let's call it - No, no, wait. Shit nicked an artery. Looks like a bone fracture in the aorta. Clamp... start over here. There's nothing to clamp. There never was. Honey! Oh my God! Don't cry Mum. Don't cry. I'm so sorry. It's different odds down here. No-one wins them all. Went the extra mile... and a half. You did your best. By now authorities still are officially searching for motives Meanwhile here in Baird Community Hospital... The gunman has been declared dead on arrival. One victim in critical condition is said to be airlifted. And the hospital says it's emergency... Miss Davenport? - I gave it already... my statement? I'm not police, I'm with the County mental health department. Are you the doctor? - No but the hospital contracts with us in these cases. So... I tried to call out, but the battery on my phone died. It's not your fault. It's normal to feel that way. No, I know that. In the next few days and weeks you may experience a lot of new feelings. Including loss of sleep even appetite. There's a list. Every day life may feel different. You might start to remember things that you really don't want to, Carla. I'm sorry, can I call you Carla? Wait a minute, eh... You got these printed out before, in case something like that happens? And then you give them out after? That's not important. It's that if you need to talk, you can. About how you're feeling. To you? Yes. Excuse me, can we speak with you for a second? You were at the scene right? - Aha, that's right, I was. Well, were you hurt at all ma'am? - No, not myself... But you lost somebody in the family, someone that you know? - No, but... Excuse me! Police continue to deflect questions about their investigation, while citizens struggle to reclaim the notion of a town that was. Re-constructive time-line of the actual moments when life and death hung in the balance, in the blink of an eye, ordinary townspeople... Carla, you drove here? - I took a bus from the hospital. We saw it, thank god you're OK You saw it? I guess I did. I tried to call Al. We didn't know where to call, I told Scott to call the police but he said no. best to wait for word in these situation, I can't help but think, five minutes later and my Scott would have been there. Are you OK now? - I guess a feel a little bit... Thank god. That's what I say. When I saw those girls on TV and that one who's father died. You don't have a scratch on you, just you know, Thank God! What's wrong with you? - He's been a little like cranky. I guess I'll see you at the diner tomorrow. - Tomorrow? It won't be open tomorrow. Good idea! Whatever. Just call us any time, we'll pick him anytime. It's gonna be OK. - Thanks. And you're the hundredth customer this month, a free bike helmet. Anne, honey, what is it? What're you doing out here? Let's just get you back inside. We've got something to help you sleep. Okay baby, just come with me. Any luck reaching him on the cell phone? - Nothing. If you don't mind I just have a few questions I want to go over? Are you sure your father didn't know anyone else at the scene, a Mr. Hagen? Mr. Carline? Not absolutely sure. I don't know. And between you, any recent problems? My dad took us in after my divorce. No questions, so, no, no problems. You're not aware of any bad things anywhere, business gone wrong? You need a hand with that? - No, thanks. My dad owns his own driving school, one room one car. Small business on his own after my mama died. He owns this house's free and clear, he don't owe nobody. So no I'm not aware of any bad things or business deals Not for several years anyway since he owed them that gambling marker? Excuse me? - We heard about that. I have no idea what your talking about. Now, if there is nothing else, I have a babysitter waiting inside. Miss Hammet, I know you want any word on your father's whereabouts and condition. Thanks for saying it detective. Excuse me. I was at the diner this morning before it all happened. You were not, why? - For a coffee on the way to the hospital. What? Then on the way out... I held the door open for the guy who shot everybody. How do you know it was him? Ten minutes later they wheeled everyone in, he was there with a big fucking hole in his head. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. It's not like I was still there when it happened. Darling! - Crazy, right? Can I get you a drink? - Yeah, that'd be good. Did the suit come back from the cleaners? I'll bring it in. Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. - You're welcome. You know Stu, you look at everything that happened here... And it's hard not to speculate on the toll... had the gunmen entered the scene just ten minutes later during the hight... Do you think he's sleeping? He was out like a light last I looked. The man said keep him home quiet, he'll talk when he's ready. Sweetie?... Sweetie? My God! Jimmy, down! Come on. Big crowd. Half of them didn't even know that Hagen guy. Or Carlin, least I worked for him once. Well I was cleaning tables when they came in, didn't even see me I guess. So you gonna let me take you out for that beer at Clusky's. Thanks, no biggie. See you around, Carla. Who was my father? An example of the kind of faith that we need most. When we are scared or tempted by doubts, or guilt, or hatred. So the Lord leads us on to fly high to the gates of heaven. To let him judge us and my father. He gave his life for mine and Jimmy Jaspersen's. My father who hid us and held on to my hands smiling. He was my dad. Wait. Kneel with me Lori, to be as brave as our dads. Let's pray to be strong enough to forgive. I want to, but... - Lori, honey. My dad was so grateful. It's what he'd want. I know that, God knows that. Jimmy and I are witnesses. Partners in prayer, aren't we. Witnesses to love and bravery to be proud of. We just want to say how sorry we are. And Bob too. Thank God one of us can testify. The network subscriber you are trying to reach is either unavailable or out of range, please try again later. Two, bet two, right away. New shooter. Okay? - No, a fucking headache, can't see anything. Migraine? I'll get you something, okay? - I'm not proud, I'll try anything. Just put this on your tongue. It's sub-lingual so, it's gonna work pretty quick. My miracle worker genius. I haven't one for such a long time Feel better, is it working? Yeah. - It is? You're a magician. - You think so? Nothing less. Ever. Anne? - One sec, Mum. Hi Ma! - Carly, that's you? My God! - How's the knee, ma? - Good enough. Now if I take to my pills and leave the weeds grow in the yard, good enough. Now are you keeping up with your classes at Virginia College? Ma, you know what happened? - And your boyfriend, ah, Steve is it? How's he? Any plans for you two? Everything is great, Ma. - Well, that's wonderful for you, Carly. Here's your dad now, he's wandering, guess the phone woke him up. Take care. - Bye, bye. -Bye I'm sorry, I'm sorry! What's wrong with him? I'm not sure. Let's try a bottle, do you have one? Are you hungry? We have a hungry man here. When did you last feed him? I tried off and on all night but he wouldn't take it he was screaming so hard. Anything different about the way you prepared the formula? - No. I don't see the point in running any tests as long as he's alert and has a good appetite, which he clearly does. I think he'll be fine. - that's great to hear. I do think you should get yourself a regular paediatrician, Carla. There are free clinics, if insurance is a problem. Well I did that parental course at the Y, and he's never had one thing wrong before. Oh I understand, but I think it's just for the best. Let's just see that you keep a regular feeding schedule. - Okay, will do See if you can get more sleep yourself. I wouldn't want those pretty eyes getting red and tired looking. Okay, well thanks, Doctor Laraby. He's not as nice as you, acts like he never saw me. How you feeling Sam? I can hardly stand up. I got a tube in my nose, and I'm too dry to spit. you? I think we'll both live. - But I'm looking forward to it. You look like you can take it or leave it. Mutual funds go down? Tough match at the club? Take it easy. Could be an improvement, Sam. Times are tough Case. You can go on for years then you drop dead on the sidewalk. Not if I can help it. - I don't think that's our call. Hey what are they pushing for migraine these days? - Molodil. It's sub-lingual. It's the quickest vaso-constrictor out there. Actually works like a charm. Possible side effects are... arrhythmia, mild tightness. And to treat that, that's...? - Stantrocet, yeah. Of course you can end up where you started, headache symptoms, stantrocet causes headache. Catch 22 huh. - Yep, how's Jo - She's good. I'll See you tomorrow. - Yeah. The rumors swirling after she was spotted in this hot exclusive LA nightclub, talking to a rich funky actor who appears to be on again, off again with his temperamental super-model wife. Bruce, Sam has been in a coma most of the night. Clear. Time? - Five and a half minutes. - Shit, I'm going to do one more, OK He's brain dead. Clear. Pulse. He's breathing. Bruce! I Just want to try one thing. - I don't care of you try 10 more things. He's brain-dead Bruce. Then what the hell are we doing here? Sorry nurse. Bruce, what's going on? We're not playing god here. You can't decide them all. I can't imagine what it's been like for you being at the diner. Look, we're all stressed here. But you've got to talk, I'm here for you. I really don't want to bother anybody. I just want to check with the students. I see. He left by 11. Are you sure. Okay, thank you so much, thank you. Seven! Winner! First of all, I want to thank god for keeping me safe. For guiding my hand to this wonderful opportunity to provide for my loved ones. Thank you big guy! How you doing? I'm fine. So I guess we're both fine and winning. And there's two kinds of people in this world. Those who are and those who aren't fine. Coming out seven yo, Same shoe. Just to say... Hey, hey, hey now! Seven! Your father and I used to take you here. Hasn't changed a bit. - Everything has. Too much has. It's a test, that's all this is ma, don't doubt anything now, just forgive. I know you want to forgive, but forgiveness is hard First there's hatred. I'm sorry baby but there's a lot of it. Doesn't it make you mad? What happened, honey? At all? Don't you miss dad? - I don't doubt anything now, I'll just be proud. Do you think that you would talk to that man from the hospital? No, all these doubts and fears can fly away just the way they came. Don't look at them, that's what they want, not what god wants. We were glad when you wanted to go to Sunday school with the other kids, but it's fine when you wanted to stop going too. You're upset, I know. There's been so much stress. Sweetheart... Come on, Mom, right now. - Yeah honey, what is it? Pray with me. Right here, right now - Stop it, Annie, just stop it. Please, kneel with me so god knows you don't have a doubt in your heart and you believe in what's true. Anne, right now! - Please kneel with me, Lori did. For me, for all us, for dad. Mr. Jaspersen, how's Jimmy? I'd like to see him. We're up for a new medical policy in my shop. - There'll be no records, I assure you. Maybe no problem too. Like you said, he could talk at any time. Mr. Jaspersen, you have a reason to believe that Jimmy isn't going to benefit? Did I tell you to come here? No, I'm here because I'm concerned for Jimmy that's all. We're concerned about our other son, Michael. He's still stuck at the VA like a vegetable. I'm sure Jimmy misses him too. Just like you. What happened to Jimmy, you ever experienced anything like that? Let the man come and see him, that's all. Do you think Jimmy's going to talk him, he can't even get in a word. You got another think coming. I got a month before we got a medical policy at the shop. What do you think they're going to do when they find out about Jimmy's so called pre-existing condition? I'll tell what they're going to do, they're going to let me go rather than pay the doctor bills. It'll be my job. Your job? This is Jimmy's life. - It won't be much worth either. The means to my end is more than met with my last bet. Thank you for your love and support. SCI FI suite. Thank you, Sir. - Thank you, Pete. That's not my name. Pete got fired. I just started. and my tag isn't ready yet - Okay. Thank you, "not-Pete who got fired". Dan. Dan, sir? Did you really win all that? I heard a 100K. Guy in a bike shirt. It must be me. Can you believe it! A CK You know what that means? - No? Tomorrow, "adios". I pack it in, first thing. Because that's my step away point. Always have a walking away point, Doug. - Dan. Always have a walk-away point. Okay, sir. I hope you enjoy your stay. You too, Dan, of the Morongo Casino. Hey, go around. - Yeah. Anne, you OK? Me and Bill made first string there's going to be a party at Mitch's. It's just a few people, if you want to go. Thanks. Ply bar's got to align perfectly. That's the battle right there. Tighten the hex nut against the main shaft. Without stripping it. Millimeter tolerances. You know what I mean Buddy? A flying Swiss watch. You and I and your brother Michael, we all know damn well that talking about it don't help. I got your back there, it's under control. You say whatever, and whenever, you're ready. Tell them, I said fuck 'em. Think they got all the goddamn answers. Fuck 'em. Come on. Fuck 'em. Give me one, fuck 'em. It's all good, That's why we're here. The chopper don't gotta think about it. Chopper don't gotta talk about it. It just gotta fly. Above it all, just gonna fly. Nothing new Ms Hammet, about where your father might be. Something else did come up. We got a partial fingerprint and some blood off the gun. Not the shooter's, that's all we can tell. Could be your dad's. I don't understand. - Neither do we. You said your father had a check-up? Does this mean anything to you? Not a thing. - It would really help if we can talk to him. We can get a warrant for his recent credit card, bank activity... I gotta take a day. We just hoped that you could help us out by providing the PIN numbers. He had a PIN? I don't have a PIN. We all want to close the book on this, for your father's own good. Is he in any kind of trouble? Thanks. Captain, Good! I need some presents to bring back to my family. You get commission, right? I do. - Beth is about 5 or 6. She's a real pistol, about yey high. Her mother, she's about your height, big in the shoulders, she's a woman, she's got... Small, medium or large, that's what we got, sir. - Oh, so you're a straight shooter. I like you captain. you can call me Charlie. Charlie CK. - Charlie CK! I got the stuff, you must have bought the square, man. What the hell. It's tragic to waste this magic. You're going to die this way... - Charlie? maybe we should... We split the winnings, what'd you say? I always leave when I'm up though. Anne, hey, share it? - With you? - Yeah. We want you to know how brave we think you are. It was really my dad. God gave him the strength to be brave. He saved our lives with his faith. She means if we pray then maybe we'll get over it, you know, quicker Yeah, sure, whatever works. Never really a popular one. She's always writing her poems and stories. And acting out her plays by herself in her room. Her dad was always her best friend. Always laughing just like kids. And then Jimmy, he rode the bus since second grade. So now he's there. Of course I am concerned about her not sleeping and barely eating. It was her idea, but... maybe it's too soon for her to be back at school. No, no it's not. She needs to re-establish her basic trust in her physical environment, her relationships, with the every day. She talks like a born-again non-stop. All faith and forgiveness. People do turn to their faith in order to get them through. Anne? Hasn't been to a church once in half a dozen years. It was God who made my dad brave. He provided people with homes for their families. Because that's what faith is. And having it says that what other people think doesn't matter. And when we pray with our eyes closed, it means that we are with God, in that moment. So will you do that with me now? For my dad? Jimmy's in his room, If you wait here, I'll go get him. - Okay. Jimmy! Jimmy! Wait! Jim! Damn! Hello? Jimmy? Is it that man? Okay, listen to me, Jimmy. What do you think you're doing, Jimmy? Come on, it's gonna be OK. It's still the two of us. Come on. Come on. Dr. Laraby please. Carla Davenport. Thanks much. Hi, how are ya? No, I guess not... He's sleeping right now. I guess just say thanks again Dr. Laraby, and maybe even... No, sure I will call one of those clinics... Thanks again. Everybody's lucky every now and then. Not if but when. This is two for real. Craps Two. Nine away. No, the plumbing contractor's supposed to start in April. Right. Then the chap's coming to do the floor and then the finish carpentry guys start. Then we're done. Jeanine had a really good point. Why sit on a plane for 15 hours all the way to Europe. When we could go to Montreal. They loved it. Great restaurants... Great hotels. So much less expensive than Europe. Your head again? Another migraine? - Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? - You have enough to worry about. This is the same as before. A vaso-constrictor. Here, under your tongue. I love when you play doctor with me. Thank you. Hey, Charlie. How you doing? Good? - All's good, captain. Take care now, okay. Anne, this seems like such a phenomenon. Such an amazing and incredible outpouring of love and support from the community. Are these people friends, here gathered to honor your dad, or is this part of a bigger movement? back toward belief in God? I think it's both. No one should be alone with their fears and doubts, and we can call out and our voices heard. And for that, I give thanks to friends neighbors and loved ones of Kalmont. Thanks, Lori. Okay guys, let us hold hands and pray. To the Lord at the hour of my distress I call and he answers me. Oh Lord, save my soul from lying lips, from the tongue of the deceitful. What shall he pay you in return oh treacherous tongue? The warrior's arrows, sharpened, in coals red-hot blazing. Talk to the hotel. They'll take a marker. Where you from? Why, are you my friend? - No sir, not me. And the one's that might be willing to stake you there, not your friends either. The minimum's 30%, depending on your collataral. And if you miss the payback. You don't have nowhere to go. They'll find you. - I just need 20 grand, that's all. You just tell them about it. Good luck. No, no, you keep it. Hello? Dad! Dad? Hello? Wounded in action, Khalia Iraq, February 19, 2003 Operation Iraqi Freedom. Keys. See you in a couple of days. Alright? Car comes back when you pay your debt, Charlie. Goddammit! - God, you are so big, come on. Fuck! - No, no! Dan! What the fuck is this? Stay awake, come on. Fuck this, Fuckin' stupid. Hey, excuse me, sir. For you? Mai Tai, for me. And a sign from on high, as they say. If you will, if you would. Feeling lucky, huh? It's come and gone, it's off and on. Well, I've been known to change one into the other, sweetheart. And that's a sure thing. Hey. Hello there. Anything working for you? Stop. That's mine. See you. He has some congestion, which could be an allergy but he's also a little dehydrated. So he could just have a fluid imbalance, from missed feedings or something. Missed feedings? - Everybody misses one, it's nothing. I'm sure he's just had the runs and your sitter hasn't told you, or something... I know I feed him, I always, all I do is feed him. How'd you go at the pediatrician? Did you call the clinic? Well I called yeah, maybe they called back maybe they didn't, I mean... And he was crying so... - It's okay, I'm sorry. We'll just feed him until he's nice and sleepy, and we'll keep an eye on him for the rest of the day. I know it's frustrating not being able to help him when he's like this, but it's nothing life threatening, believe me. But will you be here? All day. So if you just wait in the waiting room. Okay, I'll do that OK? Doctor Laraby? Don't you think everything is for a reason? Like us, here? After what happened in the diner. We all want to believe. Do you think it has a personality? Yes, of course. Why wouldn't it? yeah, what kind does it have? What kind of people would live in a house like this? - People like us. Intelligent... kind. Wealthy. - With a great sense of humor. How are the headaches? I mean... - They're okay. I love the slope of the roof against that hill, don't you? I've been looking at the plans again today, and I was thinking the sheer walls have to be where they have to be, but in terms of the space inside. We can actually go with the second spare bedroom, if we wanted to. You know, in case we... decide to... You know. What? I love you. Did you know that? Kalmont Internal. - Yes hello, Dr Laraby please? Ma'am? Hello? Please. Please. Come on. Ed Sachs, you remember him? - yeah. He had a sister in-law who couldn't talk. You know what they did? I can't listen to this. You're just worried about the insurance. It's not about that. - What is it about then? No, I'm asking you, what is it about? Honey I told you a million times. -What is stopping you from helping him. This is the last one I can bring you on the house unless you play. Sir, if you're going to play, please step up, Otherwise I'm going to have to ask you to take it back. Sorry. - What's wrong with this guy? He needs help. - By telling him how fucked up he should be? Nobody is going to tell him... - You're crazy. You're crazy, you're crazy, you're crazy, you're crazy! You keep screaming that, he'll start believing it! Can't even piss on his own, they fucked Michael's head. Michael was in a fucking war! He'd be here with us, right now, if it wasn't for... For what? This isn't about you, you self-righteous prick. God who is in all things. Let us fly free on the wings of Angels. To face fear. Avoid pride and temptation. And be thankful for their gifts. Above the sins of this earth. Give us the strength to give strength to others. In the name of thy only son. Good evening, sir. Changing 20,000. Okay, Steve, from San Diego. It's risk and reward. What we're all heading toward. Now or never. All or nothing. I have faith. I got doubts. It's your call. My question is... Am I lucky? Fourteen, sir. Hey, how are you? - Good, and you? Listen, I'm sorry. Got a case waiting, can't make it for lunch. You want to grab something without me. Didn't think you were going to make it. I left you some left-overs anyway. What left-overs? - The soup from last night. It's even better today. I had some already. Did you save any? - I'm not saving it for you. I have to head out to the site I need to check some measurements. Tell you what. Why don't you stay there maybe I can get away. You just said you couldn't, silly. I'll only be half an hour anyway. Why don't you wait, maybe later we can both go out there. I'm late now, If I'm going to get my work done. I'll call you when I get back, okay? Bye. - Jo? Can you get the day nurse to deal her, and get child services in here right now. Hey, Charlie. Just come to see how you fared. Hoping you looked like a winner. Hey, Jimmy? Jim? Bob? Bob have you seen Jimmy? No. Put it down right there. So let's be straight here, so there'll be no misunderstanding... You lost 25 in change in a day? Is that what happened? Charlie, is that what happened? Empty your pockets for me, Charlie. Use that, call a cab, call someone from your family come get you. Get down on your knees, I want you to grab the crate.

He's been gone since last night. It's OK, I know where he is. Ms Davenport we just have a few questions before you can see Davey. Will that be OK? Hold it! Hey, guy? God knows they were brave Jimmy. Dad smiled down like he didn't have a care in the world. God wants you to be brave. And you can be too. God can help you. See it that everyone felt like I do. His witness as you are too. - Tell what you really saw. Tell it! - Jimmy... This is dangerous. Whatever you two think that you have to hide. It's not worth it. - Tell it! I saw Dad. And he smiled down and he told me not to be scared. He was so brave and then... I was holding his hand and he was holding mine and then his coke spilled. - No! And there were four shots... No! Remember it! You go on and I will. - Jimmy! Please, this is enough. Tell it. He did... he did... - Nothing! Please! Please! Don't. God, please, don't! Please! Please? Don't you say anything. Ever. Jimmy, give me the gun. Just give me the gun. Here we go. I just sat... I just sat there while, a man shot dad. And I didn't do anything. I didn't know what to say and, I let go of his hand. I could have told him that... He didn't die brave like I said He was just scared and alone and he couldn't do anything mum. I'm sorry. - No, it's OK. I can't ever forgive that man for what he did. I can't ever. Joan, it's alright sweetie. OK. OK. It's alright, it's me. You're going to be OK, I promise. Casino Morongo 100,000 dollars. You OK? You want to talk? You just want to stay here for a while? In the ordinary world, we trust in where things belong. Everything has a place. And believing in that makes us innocent. And through the days, under the same sky... we hope, dream, and love. We find and lose our way. Endings our beginnings. And moments like pieces fit together again.
