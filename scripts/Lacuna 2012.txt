You've been so close with her. You don't know who she is? No matter. Let's wait for the whole world to know. You're too high-profile. It's already on Weibo (microblogs). How can you hide it?

Didn't he drink too much last night? He answer is hot tea. You say something so gross. but how can it compare with our Brother Wai? I totally agree. "Two Persons. One Frog." Nothing's more disgusting than that. And he's quite the hot topic online. Hang on Didn't you guys take Jinni to find a man yesterday? Yes How come you went to chase girls instead? It's our nature as men. Holding back human nature just isn't right. You guys are a bunch of animals. You don't understand this. If you don't try hard to chase women. your mind will go to waste. Fine, fine. Let's not talk about this. Let's get serious. HoWd you score her? You all want to know? Yes. Tell us. Just say it. We're listening. I don't know. Come on Let me hypnotxse you OK. '(WU remember M hypnotxse you You should at least remember the most crucial scenes. - Come on. - Tell us. I really can't remember. What do you think? Didn't do it is worse. Or did do it but forgot it is worse? Of course doing it and forgetting is worse. What the hell happened last night? Yesterday was Jinni's birthday. Didn't we plan... to take her to the restaurant with the most Beijing guys? But you guys booked a restaurant full of women. Let's not mention that now. Jinni hung around with us for years. We never saw her date even one guy. You can bear it, but we can't. So. our mission last night... was to find her a man. Even if it was only one night. It was her birthday. though. But honestly. the girls there are pretty good. One of them is called Mimi. Her key points are really not mini. But... But What? And there's a twin. I saw you and White Hair were all over them. But I think that girl made more effort. Waist. legs. body. So smooth. - I bet she's from a dance troupe. - 80% sure. The gift we gave was good too. Took just two weeks to get it made. Open 24 hours. We can't blame you for missing some reels. - We drank a bit too much last night. - Too much. - Only 10 jugs of beer. - More than that. Two bottles of whiskey. Some cocktails. I remember this. But then? Hen we went straight to Latte. Latte? Did we go to Latte? Yes We took Jinni to Latte. We thought she'd at least find a drunk man. Honestly. we were so helpful. Helped her so hard to find someone. But. Actually drunk men still have some sense. As a longtime champion seller at Taobao (auction site). There's nothing I can't sell. But these ladies we know. are really hard to sell. True. It was already dark enough. Still weren't able to cheat any man. But you and White Hair didn't join us. Never came back after going to the toilet. I took a taxi and saw you go to Vxcs WM a gm And then? And then we didn't see you again. Why are you here? You just woke up? I just tried to call you. But you didn't answer. That's why I just came up. Did you eat? Want something to eat? late. You're here. sister. You still have a headache? Have a seat. Steffx Yesterday... Last night. You, Sum-Wax' We Didn't we drink wine together? Can't you remember? Cheers' Look, she's so happy new And that guy mks better than you - Does he? - Are you jealous? Liar. I'm not. You know, I look at her now, and Fm so happy Look at my eyes and say it. I'm so happy'- I know. I know. He now not only does his hair but am does ms eyebrows I trim his eyebrows every two days. Make them especially neat and tidy. You know. he even plucks the hair on his nipples. You're full of shit. On his nipples. On his nipples. He treats you so well. When did you two start? Tell me. When I went on a business trip in Xinjiang? Tell me. It's the Miyun trip. You two really seized the moment. Don't insult me. I really can't stand him anymore. I'll leave him to you now. I'm relieved now. What happened last night. I truly can't remember. Sorry Are you OK? How about Jinni? Awesome Jinni drunk too much and jumped onstage to dance. Jinni's really surprising us. Actually. you totally don't need to worry about her. And she really knows how to pick a man. Pity if you can't see it. She danced WM a mack guy They danced real sexy. Truly hot. No. it's the very crazy type. With the black guy. We were staring from upstairs. We were all stunned. That black man was so long. tall and big. You guys didn't need to getjealous. I used to think love is that much Now I think love is that much I think it's more than that. Ba by. Let's go Baby. I'm coming now. I'm going now. L got to go- I reckon she never even considered us. Don't underestimate our Jinni. What about White Hair? White Hair! White Hair? Didn't see him. He may have gone off to play. I'll call him. "Hello. The number you have called cannot be reached."

We sent colleagues to take a look. We guess it's the one you lost. We brought it back here. Yes What type of pet? This was your report record. Let me see. The characteristics of the pet were long and thick neck. Small head and legs. ears straight and standing up. Lung and mm neck? Come, come, come. Come to see it. This kind of thing isn't common in a big city. So cute You take it home later. This isn't mine. Not mine either. So whose is it? How should I know? So uQW Excuse me. are there any others?

Another lost thing? No. This... This is not mine. Not yours? No. Last night. you were worrying and said something like. Without it, the $300,000 would be useless. You even said your boss would kill you. That's what you said. I mentioned the $300,000 to you? You did. You said your boss's friend told you to take this back to your boss. Without it, the $300,000 would be useless. You say I said someone told me to take this to my boss? Right. Honesy' this won't be good for either of us. If it spreads. You'll both be done for. I don't want it. So didn't you think what should be the net step? Cheers Last time I drank this. I was still with your boss. I-iow could I imagine I'd be drinking it with you instead?

You're so talented. Why do you need to work for that lousy director? You're actually much stronger than me. Don't you think? At least this is $300,000. Such a big pile of cash. And me? I've got nothing. We haven't finished. Absolutely. Don't be silly. With him. You'd better not. Tell me who hasn't fallen for any old asshole when they were young. It's normal. I must take revenge.

You were crying out all night that you wanted to ride it. How to ride it? That's only for kids to ride. Not adults. I remember now. That should be mine. You really remember? Then why did you take it? Didn't you hear what the policeman said? This is what Meng Qiqi told me to give to my boss. Otherwise. it'd be pointless to give her $300,000. Give her money and this thing? What is the relationship between your boss and that woman? - Can you hold it for me? - No. - Hold it for me. - What's up? I need to make a call. In this film try your best. Get popular.

You're hopeless. I can see there's chemistry. Don't move. It's nearly done. Where xs Meng Ow? Couldn't find her. How about the money? Couldn't find it. But I think the director probably won't ask anymore. Ready? Action! Here's the mother-to-be We were led here by a star. Your turn. Speak. Say What? Speak Say What? Some movement will be fine. When is the supper break? So hungry. Me too. I haven't eaten all day. I can't imagine you're making a film. I'm not making a film. I'm just a runner in the studio. A professional jack of all trades.
