The horse is a perfect vehicle, especially for those who drink in the night. lf you're on this, they can't make you blow, or do their checking! lt is safe, and a change as well. Got it? Got it, PT Chacko Sir? Why are you standing there like a statue? Long Live Kerala Congress! Long Live PT Chacko!! Do you have any idea what's going on in Pala? The party has split into around 26 groups now!

You held my shouldertight when you caught a glimpse of her back then. l had a hard time trying to convince her. And only recently l came to know that she started 'this' job. What's your name, dear? Bindu! Just Bindu? No initials? C.K. Bindu. C.K. Bindu! That's nice! The initials of the first girl l had were also C.K! C.K. Ammini! l'll wait outside. - So be it! C.K, my dear, Come! Take that lamp. Pour some oil, put the wicks in, and light it! Let it shine brightly! Come on, light it! Shall we start then? As you please, Sir. As a good omen, keep that lamp there. Now spread this mat over here, C.K. Who am l to you? l don't know. Then l'm telling you.. l am your father! Your?. Father! Got it? l'll lie down here like this. But l won't be lying here just like that. l'll be lying dead. Got it? ls this how you sit when your father is dead? Shouldn't you cry? Start crying then. Oh Lord Allah! You should cry sincerely! l don't have cotton in my nose. Please adjust. Ready? Aren't you going to cry? Not enough.. Let it come from within.. You can be more natural.. On a higher pitch.. Team DrC Good! This is good! Stop. Enough, dear C.K. This father is really happy! Don't cry! Don't cry, dear! Stop crying, CK! The 'programme' is over! My father died very recently. l had to start this wretched job after that.. l got reminded of my father. Dasa Pappi, Give this to her. Ask her to go to Joshi's textile shop tomorrow. l'll tell him. He will give her some job there. Shall l serve dinner? No, sister! l'm not hungry! Team DrC Hey, Have you slept? No! Then get your mat & pillow and come here. lt's okay. l'll sleep here. That won't be right! What if something happens to you in this age if you sleep alone? Come here and sleep. Admit that you're scared to sleep there alone. Then l'll come! Yes. l admit! Come! There's a saying that 'if you have company, you can even see through darkness.' l have enough company in this town, right? Then what? l'm not talking about the company to drink and to sleep with... You should have a woman as your companion! How long have l been telling you? Don't keep repeating this everyday! That won't be possible. The sexton of our church had mentioned about a girl. Whoever it is, it won't be possible! l can't cheat someone knowingly! By the way, Don'tjust lie there like you're in art film and sing a song instead! This silence is like a satan! Please sing! 'l am offering you my gratitude,' 'before l go to sleep..' 'For all the blessings you have showered on me today,' 'from your kind heart..' 'You have washed away my small sins,' 'l committed against your will; with my tears,' 'to do good deeds hereafter..' Team DrC Who is it knocking on the door? ls someone knocking? Of course! Move!! Don't open the door! Wait!! Go find out who it is. l will! Who is it? Go there and find out!! - Don't push! Who is it? lt's me! Kuttiyappan! lt's Kuttiyappan. l'm not deaf! Hey teacher, greetings! Were you busy? What is it? Come here! Don't pull me! What is he upto now? Nuisance! Kuttiyappan, what's with this attire? l'm coming after conducting a multi-religion conference all alone. Hey, Pillai, l need something urgently. What? l need.. l need an elephant. Elephant? l need a handsome male elephant! Now? Not now. Later. But, he should be really friendly. What for? l mean.. With such high diesel prices, it's not worth it to drive the jeep.. Apart from that, the roads are bad.. And when you compare the yearly maintenance cost, it is more profitable to travel on an elephant. lt will be safe, and a change as well. Did you wake me up during this midnight to say this? You go and get some sleep, Kuttiyappan! lnstead of troubling people like this.. - Wait, Pillai. Hey.. This isn't any random plan.. Don't tell this to anyone. This is a new Gandhian protest method against the global oil companies! Do you understand? Elephant, instead of a motor vehicle. Coconut leaves and palmyra, instead of oil! lsn't it organic? Got it? Got it? Got it! Then you may go, Pillai! Go complete whatever you were doing! Hey, l'll come in the morning. Finish your bath, and be ready! lnteresting... Elephant, instead of a vehicle.. Coconut leaves and palmyra, instead of petrol.. What is it? What? l'm asking you! What is it? Kuttiyappan came here to talk about buying an elephant. As if everything else wasn't enough for him! Ruining his father's money!! Switch off the lights and go to sleep! Team DrC Jesus! Hey Elyamma! Where are you off to in the morning, on that ladder?. What do l say! Coffee won't go down my boss' throat if l take it to him through the stairs inside. So he kept this here for me. What do l say! Don't say anything!! Just be careful while climbing! My God!! Elephant, instead of a motor vehicle. Coconut leaves and palmyra, instead of oil. That will be safe, and a change as well. Gosh! - Got it? Here! Your coffee! So soon? Good morning! Cry out loud if you fall down. Or else l won't hear you! Wait.. lf l have one before brushing my teeth, it will be added to the previous day's account. Where did it go? Are you trying to find a place to go in the morning? Not that! l can't find Pala & Kozha in this map. That 'Vaidyar' (physician) has come. He had asked for you. Can you move a little bit? - Why? Now l can see! Oh Lord Allah! Krishna! Lord Guruvayoorappa! Christ! My dear Dinkan, bless me!! Original, isn't it? He will show you five colours! Have you seen them, Vaidyar Mollakka? l have seen around 2 - 2 and a half.. That's more than enough for this body of yours. Hey, don't spread it too much like last time. Just stir it nicely. With one dip, one should reach the skies! What is it? l'm on my way! -Aren't you having food? What's for breakfast? - 'Puttu' & egg. Yesterday it was egg & 'Puttu'. Such variety in food everyday. Make something tasty, my dear sister! Where's the jeep key? Then what do you have on your left hand? Yourjeep? Where are you off to wearing black? To Sabarimala? l have to meet the public works secretary Usha Devi. Why? Do you want to come along, Madam? What all does she want to know! 'Arrack!!' 'Please don't drink it' 'lt will destroy your wealth and your reputation,' 'So please don't drink Arrack..' 'lt will destroy your wealth and your reputation,' 'So please don't drink Arrack...' Hey Jabbar, stop staring down there and enjoy the beats! Kuttiyappan, if l have a round in the night, l'm like this in the morning. Then you should have a round in the morning as well. You can't get rid of your hangover wearing sunglasses. For that, you should have tender coconut. Don't these people know that arrack has been banned? Then why are they singing this nonsense? lsn't this our national anthem? Should l stand up? - lf you can! l shall try!! Try! Try! Did you recognize me? Aren't you Jabbar? Get up! Kuttiyappan, - Yes. Pillai is here!! Oh! He is with his husband!! 'The yellow bird is whistling a song..' Aren't you leaving? lt's not starting! lt won't start! There he is. Ask him to kickstart! How long have l been waiting for you! Where were you? - l've come, right? Didn't we talk about getting an elephant yesterday? We have to go find one. Come! What about my scooter? - Keep it here! Drop me back before Padmini returns. You don't worry. We aren't going to Bihar. Here's the key! Did she get in? - Yes! l'll drop you back before she returns. Okay! She's gone! Where are you off to? Go that side! Kuttiyappan, Bye!! Tender coconut will be best for you! -Alright! Pillai's life finds purpose only in following Kuttiyappan! Team DrC My God! Who is this! - Who will it be? Hey! Don't touch! - Why? Aren't you on lent? - No, dear! Today's Marilyn Monroe's death anniversary. l wore this to commemorate that. Where's Damodaran? - He just left! He'll either be at the toddy shop or the party office! Should l call him? - No! l just asked. Come! Do you want some coffee? Or else.. Fresh toddy will be available now. Should l get some? Stop being so excited, my dear Usha! Let me have a good look at you! She looks like this because she's in a nighty! lf she wears a saree, she's super glamorous! She'll wear a saree if we ask her to. Would you like to see? - Yes! Which saree? Kanchipuram or Benaras? Silk! Yea right! Silk!! Come here! Hey, l need a nice girl for a couple of days. There are a couple of girls from the textile shop. Let me ask them. l'll drop them back safely! - Okay! Hey.. Didn't you say that you wanted an elephant last night? And now you're asking for young girls. What for? We need young girls to welcome the elephant, right? Got it? - Okay then! l'll ask him and let you know. Bye! There are a couple of them, Sir. But they have to get back home by evening. How's that possible? What do we do now? ls it okay if l come? My dear Usha, this 'programme' needs young girls. l know how your 'programme's are, Sir! Long back, he had taken me along with him. l was just getting into this field back then. And you know what he did? He made me apply oil all over my body.. and played a song on a tape recorder! Which song? 'O' school of the spirit..' And then, he asked me to start dancing! That too, without any clothes on! l don't even want to rememberthat night! Leave all that. You give me a solution for this. l heard that Dasa Pappi has found some fresh ones. Try asking him. Dasa Pappi! 'The wild leaves from the jungle,' 'were brought to the towns by some..' 'And there began their shenanigans...' 'Do see them..' 'Do hear them...' Thirunakkara Appaa! Kuttiyappan, are you off to the temple? Why? Can't l enter the temple? But a non-Hindu? What do you people call your own father? 'Achan' (Father), right? Us Christians call him 'Appan' (father)! That's the connection between us Christians and Hindu Gods! 'Ettumaanoor Appan', 'Thirunakkara Appan', 'Vaikkathappan', 'Ayyappan'! This is how they're called, right? lnstead, you don't call them Ettmaanoor Achan, Vaikkathu Achan, and Thirunakkara Achan, right? So can't we enter a temple? - Of course! What all should l teach you! 'The wild leaves from the jungle,' Chatterjee Mukherjee!! Lal Salaam! Oh Lord Allah! How come you're here after long? We've come here looking for Dasa Pappi. He was here a while back. He'd be inside the temple for the 'Deeparadhana' ritual now. Who's this character? This is Gopi Pillai Nair. He's a big shot in Nair Service Society! Oh! Gentleman, is it? No! Yes!! How come there's no rush today? lt's the festival at Ettumanoortemple, right? Dasa Pappi! My God! l was just thinking of you! Yea right! Am l Marilyn Monroe? For you to keep thinking of! l swear! Leave all that! You come here! By the way, do you have any nice young girls in your custody? Don't be so loud! How old? Should be of voting age. And should look like an untied elephant caparison! Are you in a hurry? - Yes! You have to give me two days time. That's quite a long time. But it's okay. There's a new one in town. How is she? - She must have 'voted' a couple of times. 'The promises l made,' 'l have to fulfill them' 'l have to fulfill them!' My dear brother, in the middle of this song, Lata Mangeshkar makes a terrific entry! 'Even if the society stops you,' 'or the God himself,' 'you will have to come to me!' 'You will have to come to me!' Pillai, Come! That man who's walking behind him hasn't understood anything! But still... 'You will have to come to me!!' 'You will have to come to me!!' Team DrC What are you doing with it, Pillai? lt's not starting! l saw Kuttiyappan going to your house! But there's no one at home! - Your daughter is there, right? Move, son!! Move, move! Today l'll be George, and you can be Koya. Then who's Malar? We'll find out when we reach there. But l'm scared if my dhoti will fall off. What is it? Look here! Not over there. Over here! Saw that? This Luttappi (comic character) is so funny! He's an awesome guy! What's your actual name, brother Kuttiyappan? Prem Nazir. Or you can even call me Salkar Dulmaan! Here! Saw him smiling? He looks just like Pillai! No way! - Of course! But he's not as awesome as Dinkan! (Comic character/God) Where were you all this while? Do you know how long l've been waiting? - l know. That's why l came running here. What happened to you? Wear your dress properly! Go get some hot water. l don't need water! - lt's for me! l have water & soda in the jeep! You come with me. We've to go somewhere urgently! My child is here! - The townsmen will look after her! Come fast! Where are you off to with that helmet? Take it off! - l'll come back soon! Where are you off to? Go that side! Sir, Sir!! Kuttiyappan Sir! Please stop! Come! l'll pull over. What is it, Usha? There's a girl in that auto rickshaw. Check her out! How tall is she? All good! Go see for yourself! Come! How is she, Sir?. This won't work out, Usha. Why? What happend? l said it won't work out. Period! Here you go! Buy something for her. Go! Oh! You got out? Don't pull your dirty tricks on me! What? Didn't you say we were going to buy an elephant? Get in! Pillai, if we go for a wedding, do we just meet the bride & groom alone? Won't we meet the priest and other people too? Got it? Got it! Then what? Nothing! - Then get in! Pillai, - Yes! How's Usha in a saree? Very glamourous! Pillai, have you met 'Elephant' Soman Nair? No! You haven't met anyone worthwhile? No! Do you know who 'Elephant' Soman Nair is? Who is he? He has won the 'Royal elephant master' title thrice! Do you know that? Once he opens his mouth, only Sanskrit comes out.. Why? He's a Sanskrit scholar! The Centre said that they can't honour 2 elephant owners in the same year. Or else he would've won the Padma Shri this year! So sad! Check out the elephant! My God! By the way, if he asks you to stay for lunch, say no. Why? On the way back, there's a toddy shop which serves amazing fish. Oh Pillai! What? - Nothing! Who is it? We've come to meet Sir. Pillai, how's this guy? Not bad! And that guy? He's also not bad! But still you can't say he's good! He's good! Hey! Don't introduce me to him! Why? - Padmini's relatives stay closeby. My dear Pillai! What happened? Nothing! Where have you come from? - From Kudamaaloor. There's some cash in the jeep's dashboard. Bring it. Please sit down! Team DrC Get up! l said get up! Bloody bd! How dare you speak such nonsense to me? Soman Sir, please co-operate! You'll get the Padma Shri! - Get up! l won't let anything happen to the elephant. Please trust me! - Get out! l said, get out! Get out, l say! l'm going! One minute! Let me wear my sandals. Sister, l'm leaving! What happened? - Get in! You Soman!! Why does he need the elephant? To get his mother married to the elephant! Let me see how you'll get the Padma Shri! What happened? Nothing! When l talked about elephants & 'Mathanga Leela', he didn't like it! And then when l recited some Shlokas in Sanskrit, he started abusing me! Uncultured fellow! Scoundrel! Won't even co-operate! Just that he owns elephants.. He's actually a loser! Kuttiyappan Sir? He's not available on the phone. He played a round here and left for Mathen's funeral in Edappalli. lt's just one furlong after Kuttampuram Toddy Shop. Team DrC Stop here! Okay then! l'll call you! - Okay! Pillai, where's Kuttiyappan Sir?. There he goes! Kuttiyappan Sir, Come here! l'll get the photos of a girl from Kollam on my WhatsApp today! Today? - Yes! - Then come! Son, please hold this! Someone better has died! That's why! Who died? - Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Really? - What happened? ls he from Pala? - Okay then, Mathen! Not from Pala! From Patiala! What all do you want to know! Once l attend a funeral, l have to purify myself! That's a must! For that, Kuttampuram is the best place! - Of course! Toddy Shop, Kuttampuram. l always used to tell Mathen, to drink how much ever he wanted. But not to eat so much! And finally, what happened? Huh? You haven't left yet? Please stop when you see a shop. Go buy whatever you want! So hot! One pack of Dinesh Beedi and a matchbox! 'Dinesh' is the best solution for this heat! Dasa Pappi, next we have to arrange a male elephant. Male elephant? - Yes! But how do l... l know that you're interested only in females! Pillai, will we have to go to Bihar?. We'll try our luck in Chambakkara as well! What's there in Chambakkara? Going for a massage? We need an elephant! ls it for a procession? Not for a procession! Just to make him stand still for a while! Then go to Mannarkkad. - What's there? A fantastic elephant has landed there. Our Rama Panicker saw him and said that he looks really grand! Which Rama Panicker? Ettumanoor Neelakandan's (elephant) first mahout! His house is just around the corner. My dear brother, Thank you so much! Come, Pillai! Where are you off to? Go that side! Please sit down. So you're from Kudamaloor?. Yes. l am Kuttiyappan! l'm an elephant lover! This is Dasa Pappi. He's a car broker! That's Pillai. He's a flute artist! Dasa Pappi, keep it there! Kuttampuram! - Yes! He made this specially for you when l mentioned your name! He's an apprentice of mine! Give him the betel leaves & tobacco (dakshina)! Bless me! All my wishes! You used to bring Neelakandan to Karikulangara & Vasudevapuram, right? Yes! l was a kid back then. You had given me the elephant's tail back then. l have given it to many. But l can't remember yourface! l was kid, right? Now l've become big! So where are you in Kudamaloor? Muriyanikkal! Muriyanikkal Judge Sir's? His lone child! But he hasn't got judge sir's glamour! l didn't get his glamour, or his good character! Hey you, bring three-four glasses! Okay! Why have you come here, son? l'll tell you all that! First you have a round! Ah! The glasses are here. - Give them to me! Do you want some curry along with this? That will be great! She's my wife, not my daughter! Have this! Everyone keeps asking if she's my daughter. So l told you beforehand before you people ask me. A really graceful girl! There was another girl who was much more graceful! While l was taking care of the elephant all the time, l forgot the fact that there was such a girl back home! And that graceful girl eloped with some guy! And then when l fell sick, l married this one. There should be someone to take care of me in this old age, right? My dear Panicker! - What's it, son? My case is also similar. My wife also eloped with someone! With whom? With a filmstar! She was also really graceful! And then, l married another one. She also ran away! - Gosh! Cheers! - So be it! How did that happen, son? What do l say! Lady luck neverfavoured me! You should know the weak spot of an elephant as well as a woman! Or else, things will go out of hand! The curry hasn't come? She'll come soon! Panicker, l'll get into the matter. Are you going? No! This is the problem! Even if l have just one glass, l have this urge to pee! That's okay, brother! Even l have that urge! - Then come! Where? - Here! l can't even try holding it back. What's the point in holding it back? Sit! Here! Nice pickle! You don't come to Kottayam? He is really strict! He won't let me go anywhere! lf you come there, l'll be near Thirunakkara temple. Just ask for Dasa Pappi. You'll end up on an elephant hook, l'm warning you! Team DrC Everything will be alright. You will have to go to Wayanad! There's one Devassi there. He'll do the needful! l will give you his phone number and address! 48.. 36.. 12.. What did you say your name was? - Vilasini! Vilasini! These beans have such tough skin! Won't even get cut properly! Ah! Laurel & Hardy are here! You have arrived at your station. Get down! Wait, wait! What is it? Do l stink of toddy? Blow! What's this? The 'Kiss of Love' protest? ls it there? - No! You just smell of oyster meat. Just wash your mouth & it'll be gone! By the way, don't go blow into your wife's mouth! Okay then! Rajan, get into the car. l'll drop you at Olassha! Recently you said you'll drop me at Kudamaloor, and ended up dropping me at Changanasshery! That was back then! - You leave, Kuttiyappan! l'll definitely drop you at Olasha today! No, man! You leave! - Won't even let me help him! Rascal! l actually had to go to Olassha! Now l'm not going anywhere today! We had gone to Chambakkara & Maranat to buy an elephant for Kuttiyappan! And what happened? Oh! Nothing worked out! Heard that we may be able to find one in Bihar! ls it? That'll be good! Since the dung gets a good price, he can recover his money quickly! Since it's Kuttiyappan, it must be a female elephant! No! lt's a male! - ls it? Sister, there are 70 sheets! Can l get at least my auto rickshaw fare if l sell this? That'll be tough, sister! The elephant is an offering to the Kudamaloor church! - ls it? That's great! That devil broke Elyamma's back, in spite of her cooking for him round the clock! And then he has the audacity to make an offering! lt's good that his parents died! Or else, even they would've suffered seeing all this! But Padmini.. - But what? Just because yourfather was his family's butler, why do you have to follow him like an ass 24 hours a day? Dad! You got a mouthful, right? Now take some rest! That will be good! l'm really tired! By the way, What exactly happened? She slipped and fell down. This won't happen if she slips! Seems like she fell from a height! The fracture is deep! She fell down while climbing the ladderto give me coffee! Ladder? That's a new method! When l got bored of seeing her taking the stairs to bring coffee, l kept a ladderfor her, for a change! But she had a timing error! Kuttiyappan! So, how're you feeling now? We'll go home and take rest! Let me see if l can find some young girls to cook. No! l will cook for you even with a broken back! Hey, My dear Bapuji, tell me what amends do l make, for the torture l did to Elyamma! Give me an idea! lf you can't give one right now, that's fine! You can tell me in my dreams! Got it? Got it? lntermission. 'Aymanam Village Panchayat Community Hall' Hey Gopi, come here for a moment. Can't you apply some dye on your hair & beard? Padmini won't allow me to dye it black! Will this programme start anytime soon? We've been waiting here for long! Don't create a fuss! We are giving you Rs.10,000/- Wear this on your hair! You'll be even more glamorous! Hey, they are giving us Ten Thousand Rupees! These days the new girls make 1 or 2 lakhs via computer. There's no one to question them at home or what? True that! Greetings! lt's an honouring function! Hey, Kuttiyappan! Greetings, President! Greetings! Come here. - What is it? This is a holy place! No such thing which brings shame to this place has ever happened here. My dear Thommi, what are you saying? Talk in simple language. Only then l'll understand. l won't give you this hall for the kind of 'programme' you're planning! Sheesh! lt's not that kind of a 'programme'! l booked this hall to honour 7 great ladies who retired from such 'programme's, paying Rs.1000. Don't you have the receipt with you? - Yes! Don't create an issue out of this! That isn't politically correct! lt isn't wrong to honour people who are respected in society.. But these are prostitutes.. - No! No! No! Even that's not politically correct! Sex workers! With 'retired' in brackets! That will be correct! Whatever workers they may be, l won't allow you to give them garlands and money in this hall! Period! The Panchayat hall is not meant for culture-less activities! My dear Thommi... Even after getting votes through spreading caste-ism, when you are talking all proudly about culture here, l feel like pulling out your tongue! But since violence isn't part of my manifesto, l'm not doing that! But l'll conduct the program here! Not for anything else! That's how it should be done! lf that's the case, then the police will take care of the rest! Ah! That would be good. lt's been long since l've been to the police station! Call! Call them, bro! Call! Bala!! Won't the police arrest you? They will! They will take me to the station. And l might even be remanded for 10-15 days. Won't l be bored if l sleep in my own house everyday? Over there, l don't even have to be scared of thieves! lt'll be safe, and a change as well! Got it? - Got it!! No! No! l didn't get it!! What? - Don't do that! These women aren't like us. lf the police comes, they will also be arrested! Should we send them to jail in this old age? lsn't that cruel? That will be bad, right? Notjust bad. Too bad! Then what if we shift the venue? A city tour with these ladies! Got it? Got it! Enough of your dance! Come! Team DrC Stop! Stop! Gentlemen, Ladies, and Policemen, Today, we're going to honour 7 retired personalities here. Some may have a doubt whether they deserve to be honoured! Nanappan? - Yes! Don't you have a doubt? No!! To lead a good life, these respectable ladies never got corrupted, never converted to other religions, never destroyed churches, never wore 'burkha's! By welcoming anyone and everyone who came hiding to them, withoutjudging them based on caste, religion or political stand, and treating them royally; these ladies proved that they are the true socialists! Pillai, Got it? Now l got it! For the attention of my brotherfrom Neena Bakery, one lime soda! With very little sugar. ls it wrong to honour these great personalities, who are unable to work like earlier, due to their old age? Firstly, we are going to honour, the senior-most, and above all, a skilful expert in her profession; our Kumarakam Nalini!! When l met this Nalini for the first time.. Do you remember? You didn't let mejoin your 'driving school' saying that l wasn't old enough! Why are you so shy? Come here! Let me honour her! Give me that cover! Hold this. Here you go! Everyone, clap for her! Thank you so much for coming! That's fine, Kuttiyappan! Back then, l came when you wanted to strip my clothes; and now l've come when you wanted to honour me with this cloth. l have no other go, right?? Next l'll come to cover your dead body with a cloth. Here! Team DrC Kuttiyappan, What happened? Now, you have the satisfaction of being done with a 'programme', right? Why are you talking like this? lt's good to give some money at times to people like us, who've gone through dirty fantasies of people like you, and turned into hags. l shall come wherever you ask me to. But.. l don't need this cloth!!! lt's good for nothing!! We got into this job because we had no other option! Even now, many girls are cheated and tricked into joining those 'driving school's that you mentioned! Have you ever felt like saving the life of at least one such girl? All men are like you!! Your pride & arrogance will be finished once you lose your virility! Enough! Stop it! The payment forthe band set? Give it to them! - Okay! Team DrC Who is it? Who is it? lt's me! Angel! Angel? l'm your dead aunt! From your attire, l thought you must be some 'Margam Kali' dancer. ls it? Where did you get this costume from? This is not how you left from here, right? l've given only pleasure to everyone when l was alive, right? So Christ asked me to turn into an angel! God is really strange sometimes.. Why are you wearing your father's gown? l'm hearing my own case! Do you want a drink? No, son! The checking is strict on the way back! Oh yea! lt's risky! You won't even have other angels to bail you out! Yea! That's true! Son, l heard what Chenkalam Omana told you. She had just one daughter. She brought her up keeping her away from everything. The guy she got married to, took her to Bombay and sold her! lt was out of that grief, that she told all that to you! Don't be angry with her, okay? Even Christ keeps saying that you men know only how to punish & not to pardon! Poor man! He was also punished, right? Shall l leave then? l came to tell you this. Don't overspeed! There are electric wires & mobile towers on the way! Be careful! Okay! Bye then! - Bye! lf you see my parents, don't convey my regards to them! Okay! You do one thing!

Stop it, Nair! lf she's shy to tell her name, it's fine! Dear, l'm going to call you 'Leela'. Leela! Hey? Will you finish cooking anytime today? Nair, when she cooks beef, will it turn out to be something else? She has been cooking at home for the past 10 years. My wife is bedridden. Dasa Pappi, - Yes! l'm starving! Get something for me. Beef & rice are ready. One minute! Does your wife know about 'that' incident? Well.. She was the one who suggested an abortion for her. Team DrC Enough. Hold it! - Come!!

So l was just watching that! l poured a little extra. Leela, the curry was really nice. l got reminded of my mother! 'What is it that l see in pitch black colour, oh mother?' 'Haven't you seen it? That's an elephant, my child!' 'What is an elephant, mother? lt is an animal, my child!' Who is it? ls it Thoma? Yes! l wanted to attend your funeral. But l couldn't make it. Who's there to take me along! Next time l die, please do come! l will come here and take you myself! Who is it? Kuttiyappan? Yes! Come! Wait here, Pillai! 'What is an elephant, mother? lt is an animal, my child!' 'lt is the biggest among all the animals, my child!' l don't usually give my elephant for such dirty jobs. What's the money like? The full amount you asked for. Come to the plantation after 10PM in the night. Greetings! Team DrC By the way, l haven't told her about the 'programme' yet. Will she create a ruckus? lf something like that does happen, just give a tight slap on her face. She'll be quiet after that. Hey! How long have you been in there? Come out! And yea, we haven't talked about the money yet! My dear Nair, you'll have to stitch 2 more pockets to keep the money he's going to give you! Okay then. Let me go there. Don'tjust stand there. Get ready, dear! What are you looking at? Have a drink! What's the situation? She just had bath. Pillai, look at me! How's it? Do l look good? Open your mouth & say something! - Yea! You look good! l should be blamed for asking his opinion! ls it OK? Really simple & handsome. You look like a bridegroom! Yea right! Bridegroom! Pour a drink! Pillai, shall we go out? - What about the 'programme'? ln this filthy room? Pillai, all that needs a good ambience. This place isn't any good! Then Kottayam was fine, right? What's there in Kottayam? lt should be cold, right? Oh okay! - Dasa Pappi, give Thankappan Nair how much ever he asks for. lt'll be in my trunk. Give it to him. - Ok. Then, l'll go, meet the girl and come back with her. Until then, you sit here and have a drink, Pillai. Got it? Dasa Pappi, - Yes! These dirty 'programmes'.. l hate them! You can get rid of that!! For people of your age, 'Velvet bean kernel' will be the best solution! Get lost, you bloody basrd! Sir.. You didn't put on any talc after bath? l like 'Cuticura' talc. l used to use that as a kid. l used to keep it inside my notebook when l went to school. To turn fair.. But l didn't turn fair. You are so fair, Leela! My father was really fair. l look like my mother. - Oh! Brother, shall we go out and come back? Why not? Of course! Shall we leave then? Didn't you hear him? Go with him, dear. Wayanad's cold climate is really great! Don'tjust stand there. Come! l'll show you wild rabbits. Go, dear. Bloody bih! What is this, Nair? Go with him! Come, dear. Fk! Team DrC Get down, dear. Come. Are you feeling cold? You should come here when the coffee plant blooms. There'll be white flowers all over. lt smells so great! l will bring you once. This Pillai needn't be there then. Just both of us! What say? Team DrC Hey, it's me! Where's our daughter? She went to her friend's house. Alone? No! With all the townsmen! You shouldn't have let her gone alone. lf you're done buying your elephant, can't you come back? How come this sudden concern about your family? Which friend's house? Come! There! Over there. Don't be scared. He's the friendly type. When you're done with it, come home. l'll be there. - Okay. Kuttiyappan, What is it, Pillai? Are you scared? Yes! Scared of me or the elephant? - Both! What are you upto? l'm going to go near the elephant with her. Why? A few days back, during dawn, l dreamt of making love to a girl by making her lean on an elephant's trunk! lt has been my desire since then.. What madness are you saying! Nothing, man! lnstead of lying down, l'll make her stand. And instead of the wall, an elephant's trunk. And the elephant wouldn't even feel a thing if she leans on him! Got it? You won't! Leela, come! Go lean on its trunk. You can trust that animal more than your father. Go! Team DrC Pillai, it was my wedding that just happened. And you are the witness. l'm going to take her home. Come! The elephant! There! Kuttiyappan, don't go! - Leave me! Listen to me! Leave me, Pillai! Leave me! No, Kuttiyappan! Listen to me, Kuttiyappan! Leave me! 'Leela' Vivek Ranjit.
