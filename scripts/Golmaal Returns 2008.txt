That,s why l,ve decided.. No, sir. Please don,t sell the company. If that happens, what will happen to my SMS.. Shut up, Mr. Subodh! Is SMS-ing all you can think about? I,m sure your entire salary is spent on sending SMS. Absolutely. - So, where was l? I,m going to fire the old staff and hire new people! Strictly vegetarians! No fish-eaters, no fiascos. correct, sir. But how can you hire inexperienced people.. No more discussion! Gopal and you, start training fresh new talent. I don,t want any mistakes. If the staff is fit, the company will be a hit! And that implies to the three of you! Good.. Good night, sir! I hope you heard him, Gopal. The boss is always right. I want the recruitment list by today evening. Make it quick. And stay away from him. Hey! - I hope you heard him. The boss is always right. I want the list by today evening. Bloody SMS! - Hello!

Tell me. I,m inspector Madhavsingh Ghai. And you are.. Everybody knows who I am. I,m Gopalkumar Santoshi. Nice meeting you. According to our informers, along with exporting fish.. ..you,re also into exporting cocaine and heroin. It,s profitable, but it,s illegal. I think that it,s your informers who are into dope. I see. - You,ve got wrong information. Please leave. I will, after conducting a thorough search of the dock. Do you have a search warrant? Yes, show it to him. Sir.. - Remove it. Sir? - What? - I forgot to bring the warrant. Sorry, sir. - ldiot! What do you think you,re doing? Taking a stroll in the park? come on, scoot! Look, you can,t misbehave.. I,ll come back!

And like always, I want to look different! come on, sweetheart! Lucky, do you know something? I was given a direct entry into the Miss lndia contest. Unfortunately, I got married before that. My husband said that I don,t need to enter the Miss lndia contest.. ..because l,m different. Lucky, your love-interest has just stepped out of the gym! - What? Wow Lucky! She,s giving you,the look,!

Am I not? ,Relax, don,t hang up., ,Relax, l,m there., Lucky, you,re blocking my view. What? Your brother-in-law needs a hair-cut? Yes. - But he got one only last week, didn,t he? Like this? Keep your arm up. Look up. Gopal! What,s this nonsense? It,s called,Power Yoga,, baby. Haven,t you heard? It,s the latest vogue. Actually, my company,s MD sacked all the unfit people from their jobs. I have to stay fit, or I lose my job. But why hire a female trainer? Get out! Don,t show me your face again. Mr. Gopal, one needs brains, not brawns, to keep their jobs. Lucky, no hair-cut for him and don,t you dare utter a single word! The truth is, you want to stay physically fit.. ..because you want to increase the TRP of your physical relations! Lucky, come with me. Sister-in-law, what,s wrong? Ask your brother. Brother, what,s got into her? Soaps, extra-marital, TRP.. They were right to have named her ,Ekta, after the queen of TV soaps.

Esha, one can buy an entire coffee house.. ..with the amount you,ve spent on drinking coffee with your friend. call him home. I,ll call him tomorrow. Thank you! Bye. That,s not possible, Jigna. Our job is to export fish, crabs and lobsters. How will you work for us if you,re cringing to touch them? I,m a little touchy about these matters, sir. I,m a pure vegetarian. You,ll have to do it, if you want the job. Ma,am, what are you doing here? I,ve brought food for Gopal from his favourite restaurant. I want to give him a surprise! Okay, l,ll help you. Touch it. - Please, sir! I can,t do this. come on, Jigna. Do as your boss says. You,ll make me happy by touching it. Do one thing. close your eyesand then feel it. - Sir! You,ll be rid of your fear. - Okay. - Okay? come on! - How do you feel? I feel rather ticklish. I told you! There,s no need to be scared.

Let,s try again tomorrow, now that you,re a little confident. Okay, sir. So, you were training her to catch fish! Ekta! Yes, she needs the job.. - Shut up! You,re following the foot-steps of Mihir Vilani and Mr. Walia. Who are these people? - Don,t change the topic! How many more affairs do you have? Out with it! Is this what you do in office? Have an affair with whosoever you can get your hands on? Why don,t you listen.. - You don,t have an answer, do you? But l.. - Shame on you, Gopal! Shut up! Now l,ll talk and you,ll listen. Sir! I,m feeling much more confident now. I,ll do a better job from tomorrow. Ekta! Looks like his surprise was way bigger than yours! Your anger is 1 00% justified, but sir is not a lecher. Why, he only starts salivating at the sight of a girl! He,s a saint, that man! The way he lusts for women.. ..anyone would believe it was his first time! You,re very fortunate. He,s a gem of a guy. But these idiots fail to understand him. They call him Gopal, the rascal! Look, this is Kannupriya,s message for Gopal, the rascal..

You,re disgusting! Making excuses of people dying.. ..to cover up your love affairs! I,m only 1 5 minutes late! What can I possibly do in 1 5 minutes? Tell her something! - You dare not utter a single word! Shame on you, Gopal. The whole world is condemning you! Even the neighbours know the number of your car.

Who exactly are you hinting at? Let me deal with him first. - What? Get out, you psycho! You,re the one who was behaving like a psycho, not me! Let go off me! - Brother! Why did you vent your anger on Mads? Rascal! Do you have to say anything? The entire family seems mentally disturbed to me. Don,t worry, everything will be fine. Out! S-U-N-l-T-A is..

Don,t be. I,m with you. What are you trying to say? What? Someone shot Gopal?! Brother! - l,m doomed! That witch from his office had warned him about her fiance. I,m sure her fiance has shot him. I won,t spare you! I won,t spare you! No Hiren, don,t hit him! Oh God, why did You have to call him so soon? I love reality, but only when it,s shown on TV! Lucky, it,s time you accept the fact.. ..that your brother-in-law is no more. You must slowly come to terms with it. Lucky, are you looking for Gopal,s photo? To hang it on the wall? I have a solo photograph of him. Lucky, control yourself! He,s become speechless because of the trauma! Hands up! Maddy! - Hi! Hold the gun. Baby! I missed you.. Esha.. where,s the dead body? Whose dead body? I don,t know of a dead body! Gopal,s dead body! Yes! Gopal is dead. I,m sorry to hear that. Where,s his dead body? It,s you who has brought the news of his death.

I,m no Superwoman who can bring her husband back from the dead. Lucky! Look, brother,s back! My dear brother! Are you all right? Yes, l,m perfectly fine. What,s going on? I was away for one night, and you people.. One night-stand! Oh Lord, why me? In which resort did you spend the eventful night? In whose lap, did you do the lap-dance? Something very tragic took place last night. Sure, spin a yarn! That you were walking by the roads.. ..when suddenly out of nowhere.. ..you saw some goons harass a poor woman. You jumped to her rescue.. ..as your brotherly instinct suddenly came out alive. No, nothing of that sort happened. Then what happened? Last night, I was walking by the roads.. ..when suddenly out of nowhere, I saw a woman.. Ask for forgiveness, my son. Remember, behind every successful man.. ..there,s a woman. And behind every unsuccessful man.. ..there are two, three, many more. Brother, who,s this other woman? Nobody! Last night.. ..irritated with your zillion questions.. ..I switched off my mobile. Later that night I ran into an old school friend.. ..who took me home. We were so engrossed talking.. Name? - Gopal. Your friend,s name! - Fishy. Akbar.. I mean, Anthony Gonsalves.

Fishy!, I,d gone to the courier office. I,ve mailed Anthony Gonsalves on the address.. ..Gopal had specified. If he truly exists, then there,s no tension in life. But if he doesn,t.. ..your brother-in-law is in deep shit. Gopal, where,s the file of new recruitments? Hasn,t Subodh Behra given it to you? Gopal.. - One minute. Kishore, where,s Subodh Behra? Sir, he hasn,t come to office for the past two days. He must be nursing his wounds. I,ll have it sent right away, sir. No problem, l,ll be waiting. What did you see? Ekta? - Yes! What happened to her? She wrote a letter to someone? To whom? Anthony Gonsalves? I don,t have a friend by that name. Lucky, you,re reading me wrong. Actually, I was with a girl that night. You,re reading me wrong again! Listen to me, first! Just hear me out. That night, l,d saved a woman from the clutches of some goons. Our cars had broken down so we had to spend the night at the yacht. Now, if I told that to your sister, would she believe me? - No. She won,t ask for a divorce, she,ll jump to suicide! Do you want your sister to commit suicide? Do you wish your parents die of shock? Do you wish to be orphaned? If yes, then call her and tell her everything. Forget it, l,ll only tell her. We,ll sort out this mess. Who,ll save us now? Whether there,s something fishy or the fish is in something. I,m amazing, baby. I,m a wonder! Be careful, let no one steal your heart! Fishy.. Fishy.. May I come in, sir? - come in. I,ve come to apply for the post of the Junior Manager. Myself, Laxman Prasad Boss. Laxman Prasad? - Boss. Do you know him? No. Who,s he? He too was Laxman Prasad. - Was? Now, he,s in seventh heaven. Anyway, sit. Qualifications? Thanks, boss. Today, every Tom, Dick and Harry.. ..can boast of experience and qualification. But I have the,X factor,.. ..that gives me the upper hand. - And what,s that? I have the solution to every problem. Just name it, and l,m there. Whether it,s the problem of stolen fish from the dock.. ..or the toilet flush that needs repair.. ..I am there! Whether it,s a clash of the corporate titans.. ..the great Bollywood scandal.. ..or the problem of extra marital affairs.. ..I am there! -,Fishy! Fishy!, What was the last thing you said? Whether it,s a problem of extra-marital affairs. I am there. No, I think you,re all talk, no show. Sir, all I ask is a chance to prove myself. Give me a problem.. ..and l,ll solve it for you. Okay, I have a friend.. - I see. ..who lied to his wife that he spent the night over.. ..at his friend Anthony Gonsalves, house. But the truth was that he had saved a woman,s life.. ..and later they had spent the night together in a yacht. Since the woman was a bit uncomfortable in the start.. ..he switched on the TV to distract her. But a hot intimate scene flooded the TV screen! The woman cringed.. ..while you cringed even further. Me? - Yes, you. You,re talking about yourself.. ..not your friend. Am I right? Do you have a parrot? What do you mean? I mean, the parrot that predicts people,s futures. No, sir. I don,t need a parrot to predict what must,ve happened. After watching those intimate scenes.. ..you took a good look at the girl,s geography.. ..sub-consciously erasing the history with your wife. Your body chemistry underwent a change.. ..drawing you physically very close towards her. And then, a sensuous, seductive, sexy romantic duet filled the air.. This was just an appetizer.. ..as you,ve already had the main course. After all, horny men.. who can stop the inevitable? Right? Oh boss! You,ve turned the colour of your shirt. Never mind, l,ll take care of your wife. She has never seen Anthony, right? - Right. She hasn,t seen me either. Problem solved! - How,s that? From today, l,m Anthony Gonsalves. I,ll tell your wife that you spent the night at mine. Okay! Tell me something. - Yes? I always thought you looked like a fool.. - Thank you. ..but I never knew that you actually were one! Thank you, boss. All you,ve got to do is hire me. My girlfriend,s family will be happy and they,ll let us get married. You don,t have a parrot, do you? - No. But I do. First, get me off the hook, only then will I hire you. Tomorrow at 9 a.m. Okay, boss. Hey! Ramu! Ramu.. Are you dumb? - Yes. Tell your madam.. Look.. Tell madam that Anthony Gonsalves is here. Yes, that,s what. No, not Bhansali, Gonsalves! ,l,ve mailed Anthony Gonsalves.. ..on the address Gopal had specified., ,l don,t have a friend by that name., ,Do you want your sister to commit suicide?, ,Do you wish your parents die of shock?, ,Do you wish to be orphaned?, Gonsalves! - Out! Out! I want to go in. - Out! Why are you kicking me out? Hey, don,t push me! Enough! I,ve seen the National Body Building championship thrice!

Get lost. - come with me. My father-in-law tells me to stand up on my two feet.. ..but my state is such that l won,t be able to sit all my life! Give me one. - You give me one first. You haven,t gone yet?! I,ll give you one tight.. - Give it to me! Get lost! - Fine, l,m going. But do make up your mind! He just won,t leave me alone! I,m going! - I wonder what he,s going to prick me with this time! I,m going! - Stop or l,ll smash you! You shut up! Sorry, not you. Move to the left. Sorry, to the right! Bend down. Go back. Lucky! - To be.. Get aside, unlucky! Should l? Hello.. Hello boss! You,ve sent him? - I don,t have a boss, okay? Shut up! No, not you boss. Okay boss, l,m on my way. No, he,s mine! One minute. Have a cold drink and chill! Let,s go. Good morning, Goa! I am Anthony Gonsalves and you are.. Ekta. Ekta! call me once, and l,ll come running to you! Please come in. Nice house. So tell me, why did you call me home? I just wanted to confirm.. ..that my husband Gopal was with you on Friday night. Why ask me? Ask your husband. What did he say? He said he was with you. You,re unbelievable! Why would you believe a stranger over your husband? Are you sure you want to discuss personal matters.. ..in front of your servant? He,s Lucky. - For whom? He,s my brother. - I see. Mr. Anthony, Gopal and you.. Actually.. - Actually, you have a disorder.. ..of becoming overly suspicious. If someone praises you.. ..you call it hard work. But God forbid if someone praises your husband, you get suspicious. If you come home late, you call it bad luck. But if your husband comes late.. ..you get suspicious. It doesn,t matter if he loves you, you say that you deserve it. But God forbid if he says hello to another woman.. ..you get suspicious! Distrust! What the..

Three years ago, I met you at my,best friend,s wedding,.. ..and it was,love actually,.. ..I was smitten like a,Shakespeare in Love,.. ..because never had I seen such a,pretty woman, before. But Juliet never took Her Romeo seriously. She thought he was just a,casanova,, a,flirt, of the first order. Your suspicious nature assumed new heights.. ..and our dream of,happily ever after, shattered forever. Ekta, you,ve scarred me for life! Your love sank like the,Titanic,.. - Shut up! Don,t rub it in. At least, I have true friend, if not a true lover. Enough Gopal! - Anthony! - Sorry Gopal, I doubted you. Leave me alone. - Ekta, listen..

So, you,re the one who,s having an affair with my husband. He,s a moron. But whatever happened to you? How come you fell for a third grader? You,re getting it all wrong. I,d called him home for a personal matter. Was it so personal that you asked him to come.. ..only when your husband was away? Stop it! Let,s call your husband. That should dissolve the confusion. Right now, he,s in the bedroom with my husband. - What?! He,s in the bedroom with your husband?! Disgusting! I didn,t know he swings both ways. Anthony, you scoundrel! I,ll divorce you. Anthony! You wife is here to see you. Please ask her to leave. She,s horribly misunderstood! She wants to divorce you. Please tell her that there,s nothing cooking.. ..between Gopal and you. Boss, help! Ekta!

Fishy!, Sir, l,ve brought the report. But I never went to the doctor. No sir, the dead body at Blue cross street.. ..was that of Subodh Behra. He had a personal enemy. He used to annoy people by sending countless SMS. Hence, the killer had chopped off his fingers. Sir, I have very good news. You,ll jump with joy on hearing it. - Are you serious? The guy who was murdered.. ..was threatened by none other than Gopal. - Gopal? Gopal. Make way! Make way! Whether there,s something fishy or the fish is in something. I,m amazing, baby. I,m a wonder! Beware! Beware! Beware, you might lose your heart. Fishy.. fishy.. Watch what I do to Gopal. What,s cooking? Fish curry, your favourite. Wow! What,s the matter? You seem to be in a romantic mood today. I became a romantic the first time I saw you. Do you remember our first meeting.. ..at your grand dad,s funeral? You looked so pretty in the white dress. Our second meeting was at a TV showroom. I was there to buy a 24 inch Plasma TV. Even you were looking very smart that day. When you took off your glasses.. ..I just couldn,t take my eyes off you. And then both of us were afflicted with conjunctivitis.. ..for the next four days. Your eyes had turned so red. And do you remember how you followed me till Mumbai? We had spent the night on the roof of my car. Our hearts were flooded with love and happiness. Of course! The entire city was flooded that day. It was the 26th of July. Do you remember the movie we went for the next day? It was our first comedy movie. How can I forget,Bawariya,! It was so funny. I remember how you were ogling at the hero.. ..when he took off his towel. Ekta, you,re doubting me again! Nobody can come between us. It,s a different matter that your dad thought it necessary to send.. ..this,silent film, on our first anniversary. Your family is no less. They sent her as,Special Appearance,. But the bottom line is,,We lived happily ever after,. The story doesn,t end here, my friend. You,ve come back?! I,m back, but not as your brother-in-law.. ..but as a daredevil police inspector! I,m investigating about the night you,d gone missing.. ..because a murder had taken place that night. The might I had come here. On that ominous night, a dead body was found.. ..on Blue cross street. Do you know whose dead body it was, Mr. Gopal? Subodh,s! His murder had taken place the night before which.. ..you had threatened to kill him! You,re done for! - No! What? - Gopal is innocent. - Yes. You too should stop suspecting Gopal. - Why? Yes, Mads. That night, Gopal was with his friend Anthony Gonsalves. Who the hell is Anthony Gonsalves? His friend! Stop doubting my husband and get out! Get out! - Out! Why does he open his mouth when he,s dumb? Send Anthony Gonsalves over to the police station. I have to take down his statement. Understood? Inspector Madhav? You good for nothing bamboo tree! Your lies are taller than you! I told you the truth now, didn,t l? - But why did you lie to me earlier? That was for the lie you told me earlier.. ..that certified you as a liar. Bloody liar! I hate liars! And you told me one lie after the other! You.. Hey! What are you doing? I don,t know him. I hate liars! - Save me! Who are you? I.. I.. Anthony Talpade! Anthony Gonsalves. Did Gopal send you? - Gopal! Pinky! - Yes, sir! Take his statement. - come. Liars never go unpunished from my station. What have I done? Who,s talking to you? Get out! c,mon! - Take him away. Keep it here. Dare you move! First, l,ll chop off your hands with a saw.. ..and then hack your legs to make the movie,Saw 5, Boss, l,ve given a false statement but l,m petrified. Because no sooner does one problem end.. ..than a new one emerges. Don,t worry, my friend. Don,t be so scared. We,ll handle Madhav just as we handled Ekta. Nothing will happen. What are you looking at, man? She,s way out of your league. She,s,Miss congeniality,, while you,re. Hi! Excuse me! Hell! She,s hitting on him. Nowadays, even phones without ring tones.. ..are in demand! Yes. Go, talk to her. Open what? Fine, I understood. come, let,s ruin his day. Iet,s make his day. Excuse me, may l? - Please. Thank you. I,m Gopal Kumar Santoshi. I,m Anthony. Lakshman Prasad Apte. And he,s Lucky. He doesn,t have a surname. I,m Daisy. - Daisy? - Daisy Daisy! Daisy Daisy? Unique name, isn,t it, boss? It,s possible. If we get Lara Dutta married to Brian Lara.. ..then what,ll her name be? Lara Dutta.. Brian Lara.. Lara Lara! Exactly! But I hope you aren,t married. - No. - Good! I,m Lucky,s younger brother. The whole and soul of ,Golden Fisheries,. I love sunsets and practice power yoga. I,m a bit of an introvert but.. I like good company and.. Sorry, could you repeat what you just said? He said that he loves watching sunsets with his wife. He,s married. - I see! Lucky, why are you so quiet? Say something. Say something! Na na nee na no?! Actually, the poor fellow.. He,s saying that Nana Patekar gifted a Nano car to his grandma. Gifted a Nano to his grandma. He,s a hairstylist, so he trims everything he says. How sweet, Lucky! I was saying.. Excuse me? Daisy! - Hello! Daisy Daisy, he,s saying something. Hey turn around! Why are you standing behind me? come to the front. How will I understand you if I don,t read your lips? I,m deaf. Whoever said that love is blind? Love is dumb and love is deaf! If the movie,Black, is remade, their casting is confirmed What are you doing? What are you doing? Leave him! Stop! What are you doing? Let go! What are you doing? Just a moment! My phone,s ringing! Hang on! Hello! Yes, Meera. I,m coming. Boss, Meera is waiting for me at the mall. I,m leaving. Bye. I,m leaving too. Baby! - Baby! Good news! - Good news? No, not that. Amma, appa, Sonappa and chinappa.. ..all have agreed for our marriage. Really? - Yes! We,re in a shopping mall. Listen! - Yes. They,ve fixed the wedding for 14th February, Valentine,s day! Really? - Yes. And exactly nine months later, children,s day.. ..there,ll be a junior Lakshman playing in your lap. If we have a baby girl.. We,ll name her Sridevi. - What if it,s a boy? We,ll call him Rajnikanth Lakshman. Let,s find a corner to get cozy. - In a mall? Yes! come this way. Sister-in-law, how,s this jacket? Esha, did you see that? How,s this? - Yes, baby. Very nice. Anthony Gonsalves? Very nice. - Behave yourself! Look how he,s sticking to her. - How romantic! That,s why these malls have become so popular! Idiot! Do you know who he,s hugging? It must be his wife. She,s not his wife. Julie is his wife. You weren,t around when she came home the other day. Baby, aren,t these the same shoes with which you hit me? Yes, baby. - How cute! Esha, Anthony turned out to be of a loose character. I have a strong feeling Gopal and him are making fools of us. What do you mean? They both were cheating on their wives that night. He lied to Julie while Gopal lied to me! They both were together. But how do we make sure? By going to Machhi Lake, Dockyard Lane, Prawns, corner! Excuse me, where does Anthony stay? Top floor. This rascal has hit the jackpot! Julie.. - Gosh! What kind of a woman are you? You,re so frustrated that you stalked my husband till here? Hey! Mind your language. We,re not like your husband. Yes, your husband is having an affair. I,m 1 00% sure that our husbands.. ..are cheating on us. - Oh gosh! I just came here to know what exactly happened that night. Is it so? Wait a minute, l,ll call him. Anthony, come out! What are you looking at? call your master. What kind of a servant Julie? He,s not my servant. This rotten banana peel is my husband. Are you Anthony? ,Will you ever tell anybody that you,re Anthony?, ,Don,t hit me!, How many times do l have to tell this? Who,s Anthony? Where,s Anthony? I,m Soulwinder Singh. You! - Just a moment, Julie. Why are you forcing your servant.. ..to pose as your husband? I swear by Jesus christ! He,s my husband, Anthony Gonsalves. I,m Anthony Gonsalves! When I tell the truth, I get thrashed. When I lie, I get thrashed. I am the one. Do what ever you want! My death is inevitable! I,m Anthony Gonsalves! Do as you please. Anthony, this is what happens.. ..when you mess around with women. Is it? But Richard, l didn,t get hurt at all. You didn,t get hurt? - Not at all. Not at all! - Strange! Esha, if he is Anthony, then who was he? Lakshman, the MP Of Thiruvananthapura.. ..had asked for my daughter,s hand in marriage. But Meera likes only you. And now you even have a respectable job. I,m very happy. You both look as if you,re made for each other. Just like Lord Shiva and his wife Goddess Parvati. Lakshman, what are you waiting for? Feed her some sweets. She has yet to apply henna on her hands. Oh God! Let me feed you some sweetmeat. - Oh God! Anthony Gonsalves? Where are you taking him? You want to get married, do you? come, l,ll get you married in prison. Get in! What,s with the shocked expressions? c,mon, bid farewell to the groom. I know it must be weird.. ..to see a police van instead of a palanquin.. ..and bid adieu to the groom instead of the bride! Nothing to worry, relax! What happened, mother? But what crime have I committed? - Nothing. Your name is Anthony Gonsalves, right? Anthony is here. Amar and Akbar will follow.. ..and soon we,ll get to watch a movie together. Excellent! Amma! Appa! chinappa! Lakshman, what have you done? I haven,t done anything. Save me! Don,t leave me at his mercy. Boss, my engagement will break.. Why are you crying? Do you want to partner? O partner! Love me, love me say.. - Boss! Gopal, you threatened to kill Subodh, the SMS freak. And then you went missing on the night of his murder! To top that, you introduced your real wife to the phoney Anthony. And made the phoney Anthony give a phoney statement! You,re great, man! And the funniest part is that this case has come to the cop.. ..who,s your greatest enemy. Me! In short, you,re dead. So sad! Boss, we all are in a fix because of your philandering nature. Shut up! Get lost! - I have to give you one first. It,s a government order. Give me one. Madhav, the truth is that l rescued a woman that night. I spent the night with her on a friend,s yacht. Who,s she? Where does she live? If we look for her, we,ll find her. Give us some time. Okay, you have 1 5 minutes. Am I a fool to let you go scot-free? Scoundrels! Kiss him! Madhav.. - Yes? Have you forgotten? - What? Esha! Madhav, don,t put your personal life at stake.. ..for the sake of your professional life. Gopal, this isn,t fair. I,ll give you time. Hey! Hey! Sir, please open it. Gopal! Just three days for the three of you. Three days? - Yes, in English. If only we were more in number, we,d have gotten more time. I,m there, am I not? - Shut up! If you don,t find that girl that girl in three days then remember.. ..that I don,t love Esha as much as I hate you! Wow! What a dialogue! Three days! Get out! Ekta.. - Madhav called me and told me everything. Madhav, that son of a.. Baby, I know you,re hurt. But why do you have to leave home? I won,t let you go. You can,t leave this house and go. I,m not leaving the house. You are! This is your baggage, not mine. You,ll sleep on the lawn till you find that girl. How can you do this to me? I,m your husband. - Shut up! Find the girl in three days or this three year long marriage.. Ekta! Hey, c,mon girls! It,s party time! Let,s rock. What will you have? c,mon girl! - Beer! Beer! Hey Baljeet! Gopal, my friend! You,ve come at the right time. Get ready for a high sea adventure. c,mon! Girls, booze, great fun! Hop on! I thought your brother-in-law is a scoundrel.. But his friend takes away the cake. No, thanks. I had some work with you. Tell me, man. I was here with a girl last Friday. I,m looking for her. Was she here by any chance? No. But were you here Friday night? No wonder everything was so messed up! Messed up? Why are you turning your face away? Your brother-in-law indulges in cheap acts.. ..with cheap girls and I have to bear the brunt of it! What,s the deal? What did you do with her? Let it go, man. Thanks. Look at me. I said.. - What,s going on? Tell him on his face. Why do you always back-bite? Nothing, boss. I,ve got a call. Okay, Baljeet. Enjoy yourself. Bye! - Why are you sticking to him?.. ..Meera? - Lakshman, why did they arrest you? Meera..- Are you involved in drugs? Or the underworld? Did you rape somebody? Meera, l,m not alone in this. You mean, gang rape?! Gang rape?! What nonsense! At least, hear me out. I swear to God, l,m a notorious.. I,m not guilty. This is the first time in our family history.. ..that the cops ever came home. Enough, Meera! Everybody including you knows.. ..that I never lie. Actually my boss is involved in a case concerning a girl.. ..and in the process of helping I too got entangled. But once we find that tramp, all the problems will be solved. Trust me, baby. Boss, you continue to amaze me! Why didn,t you ask that hussy for her name or her contact number? You got a chance and you jumped the gun! What is it? Women,s day celebration at central Mall. 70% discount on all products. 70%! That means your hussy will surely come there. But it,s exclusively for women. No men. - No men?! No! No! Fishy.. fishy.. Fishy.. fishy.. Fishy.. fishy.. Fishy.. fishy.. She,s nowhere to be seen. Shall we check upstairs? - c,mon! Excuse me! Thank you. Which floor? Lift! - Stop! I,m so sorry Gopal turned out to be a complete nymphomaniac. If he doesn,t find that girl, will you kick him out of the house? Exactly! He deserves it. Will you throw me out, too? Of course not, silly! You,ll stay with me. - Thank you. You,re so sweet. He should be ashamed of himself! I,m ashamed to call him my brother. How sad! It,ll be fine, okay? come on. Sister-in-law! Excuse me. Where,s Westside? Shut him up! Please excuse my friend. She,s made in china. Lucy Liu. - Lucy Liu?! Westside must be to your west! You,re right. Sister-in-law, she,s so intelligent. - Thank you. Okay, thanks. - Thank you. My sister is bitching about me! I,ll give her.. Ekta, you dropped your mobile. This was Gopal,s voice. Yes, this was Gopal,s voice! Gopal! Oh my God! Gopal,s voice! - Oh my God! I want Gopal. I want Gopal, mom! Gopal knows them too? Hell! Brother is so shameless. He knows them too! come on! Mom, I want Gopal! Where,s Gopal, mom? Tell me please. What happened? How will you do it here? We,ll have to go to the ladies washroom. Boss! Boss! Boss, my girlfriend is here! When my wife didn,t recognize me, how can your girl recognize you? Let,s go. Go to,His,. - No, you,ll be caught. Go to,Hers,. Tell him that by changing one,s looks.. ..the person,s sex doesn,t change! Have some shame! If he goes to,Hers,.. Go to,Hers,. No, go to,His,. - Go on! It seems as though it,s going to snow in the mall. This is Madhav. - How do you know? He,s played this game earlier as well. Let,s go! Rascal! Boss, he,ll surely get us trapped. - Excuse me! Gopal. - Yes? I knew it! Did you find the girl? - No. Just two days left! Do you want to pee? You,ll be in the lockup in two days! Why isn,t it snowing here? Boss, just one more night to go. After that, we,ll have to do this behind bars. It,s been two days but your brazen, god-forsaken hussy.. ..is nowhere to be found. How will we spend the night if we don,t find her? Hey! Poor Gopal! From the,man of the house,.. ..you,ve become the ,man out of the house,. From a penthouse, you,re living in a tent house. I,m feeling very bad, friend. - lt,s all because of you. Yes, I can,t help but take the credit. Never mind. So, did you find your girl? Not yet? Shall I meet my girl then? You.. - No! - Leave me! I know that she,s your sister.. ..but I can,t let go of such an opportunity? - She,s my sister! Romantic song with violence! Whoa baby! Where will he run to? I,ll get you for this! Make way!

You look worried. No, sir. Subodh Mehra,s provident file is ready. You need to sign it. Yes, drop it in my cabin. Okay, sir. Who do you think has killed him? He didn,t have any enemy. - Except you. Did you.. I mean, only you used to be at dagger ends with him. I,m just kidding. Make sure you send me - Yes sir. Hello! Is Lakshman there, sweetheart? Give it to him. Talk! No, go ahead! Boss, type my promotion letter along with my appointment letter. What for? The girl with whom you sang ,ding-dong, all night long.. ..is sitting in front of me. I,m calling from her house. How did you find her? Don,t ask questions. Take down the address. Where,s she? She is not that girl. Hey sweetheart! I like you. What are you talking about? You forgot me? Take a good look. I,m the same girl. Remember, when we were walking on the street.. ..a few goons teased me all over.. ..enough for you to have an action sequence with them. You beat them black and blue and then we went on the yacht.. I like you! No. Have you undergone plastic surgery? What,s he saying? Wait, l,ll explain. No, Lakshman. The story is correct but the casting is wrong. Lucky, your brother-in-law hasn,t forgotten her face yet. I,m sure she must,ve been unforgettable. What say, lover boy? Boss, only you know that she is Madhav has no clue. After she gives her statement, our problem will be solved! As far as the one-night stand on the yacht is concerned.. ..she,ll censor all of that. Ekta,s problem will also be taken care of. If I can pose as Anthony, why can,t Munni pose as that hussy? She charges three lakhs per customer. Yes. I like you. You,d promised to give me only two lakhs. A lakh more for my make-up? - Shut up! Boss, I was about to say two lakhs but.. It was his idea to extort 3 lakhs.. ..and split the extra cash between us. You keep the extra cash. I refuse to be a part of your fraudulence. It was his idea, boss. I was only trying to bargain.. I,d heard that friendship is stronger than blood ties. Blood ties don,t matter. No, boss. Friendship is the ultimate relationship. I won,t spare you, you scoundrels! No, boss! - Rascals! Jesus, I like them. So cute! Vasooli! Munni! - Vasooli! Munni! - Vasooli! Tell me, how do I look? You,re a bombshell, man! How,s my lover? - l,ve gone cold without you. Then listen to some hot news. The money has been arranged for. What are you saying? - The money has been arranged. That,s what l,m saying. Tomorrow, you,ll be freed from prison and then.. Underneath the blue sky, on a faraway land, we,ll buy a plot.. ..and build our house of dreams. The interiors of the house will be done in blue. Ever since your eyes met mine.. - What,s going on? Nothing. Vasooli,s singing. Our eyes met.. Ever since your eyes met mine.. Munni! - You sing really well! Wow! You all look so relaxed. Resting, munching on apples.. Very good! Gopal, it,s time for the climax of the movie. The movie isn,t over yet, my friend. Does your movie begin after the climax? I,ve found my girl. Goddammit! I hate it! Munni! - come inside. Munni! Munni! - Munni! Munni! Hey Munni! - Munni! Gopal, listen to what Munni has written in this letter. ,You used me thoroughly, But I didn,t object., ,You kept me like a keep, how cheap!, ,But I didn,t object., ,You committed so many frauds in the company., ,But I didn,t object., Thank you. ,But after mercilessly murdering Subodh Mehra.. ..you want me to testify that you were with me that night?, ,No way! I hate you, Gopal., ,l,m leaving town. Munni., Madhav, Esha must be waiting at home. Are you serious? - l,m her brother. - Is it? But who can let go of such an opportunity? - correct! Had it been a little bigger, l,d have slung it around your neck. Listen to me, Madhav! I haven,t done anything. I,m sure Subodh Mehra,s murderer has kidnapped Munni. I,ve been framed. In that case, thank the murderer on my behalf. I like him. Yes! Look Madhav, an lndian wife can never let go of her husband! Fights and arguments come later, husbands come first. She has even brought a lawyer to bail me out. Why are you bailing him out? Ekta! Gopal, he isn,t a criminal lawyer, but a divorce lawyer. Now it,s up to you whether you do it mutually.. ..or fight it in court. A divorce case along with a criminal case! Buy one and get one free. Indian women are great! Ekta, I swear I haven,t murdered anybody. I haven,t cheated on you either. Thank you, Ekta. - Ekta! You,re feeling lonely, isn,t it? I,ll do you a favour. I,ll get you your two cronies for company. Whether there,s something fishy or the fish is in something. I,m amazing, baby. I,m a wonder! Be careful. Let no one steal your heart! Fishy.. Fishy.. Fishy.. Fishy.. I,m talking about you. D company. Which company are you working for? My company? - Which racket are you involved in? Racket? I haven,t even touched a tennis racquet till date. I,m speaking the truth. Tell her something. Let it be. I,ll explain. I guess l,ll have to tell you the truth. Actually, it,s my shameless boss and his brother-in-law Gopal.. ..who has put us in this sticky situation. The cops suspect that he murdered someone.. ..Iast Friday. Boss says that he was at Red Rhino disco that Friday. And that when he left the place, he saw a few goons.. ..harass a girl on Blue cross street. He rescued that girl, pacified her.. ..and took her on a yacht at Malegaon beach? Yes, but how do you know all this? Has a film been made on it already? I,m the girl your boss rescued. You?! - Yes. You,re the one! Why does this always happen to me? I,m doomed! My life is ruined! Meera is that girl! Why, Meera is that girl! Meera, for god,s sake, my sake and namesake.. ..tell me that it,s a lie! It is the truth! Why me? You should be happy. - Yeah, right! Because the girl who you,ve been looking for.. ..is standing right in front of you. Why should I be happy? Am I getting married? Meera, this means that Gopal and you.. that night on the yacht.. I,m doomed! Tell me, in which lcU ward is your family admitted? Book a bed for me as well. I can,t take this! Shut up! Just because a man and a woman spend a night together.. ..doesn,t mean that something happened between them. How could you even think of such a thing? Gopal is innocent. I,m going to the police station to give my statement. One more thing.. - Is it loose? Love and trust should go hand in hand. You shouldn,t marry me if you can,t trust me. I don,t want Gopal and his wife,s story being repeated in my life. Meera.. - lt,s all because of having no trust! Distrust, what the.. Meera.. Meera.. Look, l,m really very sorry. I made a huge mistake. I,ll never again doubt you. I, promise, sorry. Wear this, please? Please? Whoever gave you this ring? I,m kidding! Sorry, sorry. Let,s go to the police-station. What are you laughing for? Just because a man and a woman spend a night together.. ..doesn,t mean that something happened between them. She just said that a man and a woman spending a night together.. ..doesn,t imply anything vulgar. Stop laughing! - Stop it! Look at me. - What are you doing? Nothing, darling. He takes longer than usual to understand things. Look at me! Just because a man and a woman spend a night together.. ..doesn,t mean that something happened between them. Stop it! - Hey! Where,s Munni? Has your child gone missing? - Not my child, my child,s mother. Vasooli,s Munni. - Who,s she? Jail return. - Munni? We have no idea where she is. Leave your mobile number.. ..I,ll give you a missed call as soon as I find her. Missed call? Mobile? Ever since Munni became a part of your network.. ..she,s been out of reach. Who,s she? She,s not Munni. - Leave me! You can,t do this. You can,t take the law in your hands. So, her name,s,Law,? Now, wait for Vasooli,s verdict. Ok. - Send Munni and take your friend,Law, in exchange. You don,t know me, I have a gun! c,mon, Law! What are you doing? Meera! My mobile number is 9002200001. Don,t be afraid, l,m there. I,ve already said that. Inspector! Rascals! I,ll shoot both of you. - Just a moment. We found the girl. - Which girl? Meera. - Who,s Meera? The one who spent the night with Gopal. That was Munni. - No, she was a part of our plan. Which plan is Meera part of? She,s my girlfriend, sir. Enough! - Send Meera over. Vasooli took her away. Who,s Vasooli? - He,s Munni,s boyfriend. If he,s Munni,s boyfriend he should take Munni away. Why did he take Meera? Because he wants Munni, sir. That,s why. He,s crazy! Mads, enough! - Baby! - Not now! Are you planning to put my entire family behind bars? I want to put them in an asylum but l,ve to make do with a jail. Enough, Mads! - Enough, Mads! Why are you sounding like a guy? - Mads! - Yes? Gopal,s my brother. - So sad! He,s so tense these days and instead of helping him.. ..you,re always after him. - l,m so sorry. Mads, free Gopal. - He,s already free. His MD, Mr. Sawant bailed him out. We should catch up with them. - Why? Because boss has a knack for inviting trouble! Thanks for the bail, sir. Anytime Gopal. But where are we going? - Lover,s point. Hey! That,s boss and his boss. But why are they going to Lover,s Point? Is he like.. Poor Ekta! She always thought that Gopal had affairs only with girls. I must inform Ekta. Ekta, reach Lover,s Point immediately. You have no idea what your husband is upto! Hello! Vasooli, come to Lover,s Point with Meera immediately! Don,t you want to call up somebody? Oh God! crazy family! Sir, why have we come here? I,d like to show you something.. ..before answering your question. come. It,s for you. Read it. I, Gopal, in my complete senses, admit that.. ..I,ve killed Subodh Mehra?! - Subodh Mehra. It,s because he found out that I smuggle drugs. But now l,ve realized my mistake.. ..and l,m committing suicide. - Suicide?! Are you going to commit suicide, Gopal? Sir, I haven,t written this. But the handwriting is yours, right? Yes, but I haven,t written it, sir. Maybe you haven,t. But how,re you going to prove that after your death? Subodh Mehra found out that Mr. Sawant exports drugs. Faster! Hence, I exported him to heaven. You were a suspect for the murder right from day one. In order to prove it, I kidnapped Munni and also forged this letter. Yes! I knew it. I knew it. ,Golden Fisheries, smuggles drugs. I knew it! I,m a Super-cop! - Yes. But that also means Gopal is innocent. Damn it! Munni! Meera,s passport is right here. Vasooli,s coming here too. Take a look, the noose is awaiting you. You could,ve opened it yourself! Mads, let,s save Gopal or he,ll be hanged unto death. Let,s go save him. - I don,t think so. The problem is that I wasted all my bullets on these two. I have a gun, but it,s empty. What?! - Sorry! careful! Hurry up! Gopal Wait! Let my husband go. He may cheat on me, but he,s my husband after all. I,m so glad you came! We were so worried. We looked all over for you! I,m here, lover boy. I,m the girl you spent the night with. And I like him. - Hey Munni! Not you! Ekta, she,s the girl. Lakshman, my friend, she,s the girl! She,s the girl I spent the night with! Take a good look, Madhav. - She. Yes, inspector. I,m the one. No! So cheap! Is he your brother?! Bloody nymphomaniac! Gopal, now I have no reason left to live. I,m going to suicide. Ekta! - Sister-in-law! This noose isn,t designed for you. Give me your hand, step down. Have you gone mad? Please save her. - Why? She,s going to hang herself. - I asked her to leave Gopal.. ..but she didn,t listen to me. Silly girl! Put Gopal back on the platform. I didn,t spend the night with two women! We had hired one of them to play the part. What about the other one? - The other one.. I was with the other one, but.. You don,t have an answer, do you? Baby, save her! Wow, boss! Bad butterfly! Was Gopal with Meera as well? Not you, him! Well done, boss! You,ve finally spoken the truth. What are you blabbering about? I didn,t do anything. Then why do you smile.. ..every time I ask you about that night? Did you see that? That,s because I have a smiling face ever since childhood. Shut up! Do I look like a fool to you? Sister-in-law, step down. Let me hang. Somebody has to die, l,ll die. Where are you going? What are you doing? Step down, Lakshman! I,m sorry. I,m your boss, boss. Listen to me. come down, let Gopal hang. Get lost! To hell with my boss! Lakshman, stop right there! - Gopal.. Shut up, rascal! Sister, please listen.. - Get off, dog! I should be the one dying for having loved a guy like you. I convinced you so much, yet you doubt me. Give it to me, I want to die. - What are you doing? It,ll break! Just a moment. At least, tell them the truth before you die. - Sure. Ekta, I swear to God.. ..nothing happened between Gopal and me that night. I told you! - Your husband is innocent. But I don,t know what transpired between that hussy and him! God, l,m coming. Get lost! - Leave. - God, l,m coming. Wait! I won,t extort money henceforth. - I can understand. This scoundrel didn,t spare your lover as well! Go, hang yourself. Hey! Where are you going? Sir, I can only request you.. Law, give me that noose. I should be the one dying. I loved you and thought of you as my own.. ..but you betrayed me, called me a madman! No! - Oh God! I have no reason to live now! Give it to me, I want to die. The one for whom I put layers of make-up everyday.. ..doubts me. I hate you! But I want to clear something before I die. Look ma,am, I don,t have an affair with your husband. Damn it! - Nothing happened that night. This fellow gave me money to do the act. - Rascal! I was always chaste, I am chaste but won,t remain anymore.. ..as l,m dying. Munni, don,t be so silly. You,ll die! Enough! Stop it! Nobody dare move! Fools! The cops have surrounded this place.. ..from one side. And don,t you see this? It,s a gun. I,ll shoot you! Stand straight! This is cheating. You told me there aren,t any bullets in it. Fool! Why did you have to tell them that? You,re the biggest fool! And l,m a bigger fool to have loved you. God, please help me! Where are you going? Sorry! Brother, let me die. I don,t wish to live anymore. What are you doing, Nisha? How dare you make my sister cry! There aren,t any bullets in it. - Darn it! Shut up! - You all are good for nothing. What,s going on? Shut up all of you! Somebody tell me what,s going on! I,ll go crazy. - Hang yourself! - Get up! I asked you to tag a few men along. Now who will handle this troop of lunatics? He,s calling us a lunatic! I,ve decided. Only one person shall die! - Who? Me! - I help you. I want salvation! Thank you, Gopal. I,m coming! Bring me down! What are you so angry about? Gopal is innocent, Madhav. I may watch serials but my husband isn,t a serial killer. Boss, control your anger for now. If your sister marries a cop.. ..he,ll be able to rescue you in the future. c,mon, Mads. Shake hands with brother. Only then will you get my hand in marriage. Shake hands, sir. - Enough! Not so high, a little lower.. Towards the left.. Yes! - lt,s okay. Wow! What has God made! Sorry. - lt,s okay. Sorry, Ekta. I lied to you. You lied because l always suspect you. I promise I won,t watch soaps from today. Good! - Yes! - correct! Soaps are highly contagious! Did you catch yesterday,s episode of F.Rl.E.N.D.S? Ross is dating some new chick! Really? Who? They haven,t disclosed that yet. Tonight, the big secret will be out! c,mon! There,s still time. What the hell was that? Balaji! Sawant was punished for his deeds. As they say, what comes around.. ..goes around! And now, l, Babloo Pachisia, As the owner of Golden Fisheries.. ..it,s my duty to introduce to my employees.. ..the new managing director of the company. congratulations, boss. You,ve become the MD. Same to you, you,re going to take my place. Of course. A big round of applause for the new managing director. Daddy! Hi! - Hello! Lucky is the new Managing Director.. ..as also my future son-in-law. When the lovers have made up their mind.. ..there,s little a stupid (cupid)can do. - Daddy! Oh my God! You,re going to be a big man now, almost a VlP! That,s why, for your security.. ..inspector Madhav will accompany you 24/7. Gopal and Lakshman will work under you. Down under. Okay, carry on. Move! He,s our boss?! In the first one, he took the girl. In the second, he stole the job. And in the third? Will he be even there in the third? What nonsense! You can,t kick me out of the third film.. ..just because I played dumb in the first two. That,s not happening! Never! I have a three film contract. I still quote the same price!
