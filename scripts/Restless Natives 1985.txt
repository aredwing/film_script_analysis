I...I...WE ARE NOT HERE FOR REVENGE. WE ONLY WANT TO...TO FILM IT FOR OUR PROGRAM. YES. YES. YES. Woman on TV: THAT WAS MICHAEL DOUGLAS REPORTING... WHEN'S THE NEX HOLD-UP? WHAT DID YOU SAY? I WAS JUST WONDERING WHEN YOU THOUGHT THESE MEN MIGHT DO THE NEX BUS HOLD-UP, YOU KNOW, UP NORTH. OH, AYE, HOLD-UP. HOLD-UP. WHAT HOLD-UPS THAT? THERE IS A LOT OF FUNNY THINGS GOING ON. YOU SHOULD READ THE NEWSPAPERS. OF COURSE, I HAVEN' REALLY BEEN FOLLOWING IT. HOLD-UP. I GUESS THESE THINGS JUST HAPPEN OUT OF THE BLUE, DON'T THEY?

AND RONNIE WEATHERSPOON KNOWS. WE'VE ALL GOT BIRTHDAYS COMING UP SOON. [SEAGULL CAWS] I MADE THEM PROMISE AN OATH OF SECRECY. I SAID, I SAID THEY COULD BECOME HONORARY MEMBERS IF THEY COULD PROVE THEY COULD KEEP A SECRET. WELL, AND SOME MORE JEWELRY. THEY WAN IDENTITY CARDS, RONNIE, SAYING THEY'RE MEMBERS. LOOK... KEEP YOUR HEAD, OK? ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME THAT YOU ARE SCARED OF A BUNCH OF WEE LASSIES? LOOK, LOOK, YOU'RE IN THE BIG TIME NOW. KIDS CAN GET DAMAGED MESSING WITH PEOPLE LIKE US. YOU KNOW, LIKE, MUTILATION. I'LL TALK TO THEM AGAIN. MAYBE I COULD-- [DIAL TONE] HELLO? HELLO? MR. ILLINGWORTH. EXCUSE ME. THERE'S A LADY HERE WITH A BIT OF A PROBLEM. AH, YES, HELLO. EXCUSE ME, SIR.

Bender: I THOUGHT THE IDEA OF THE BARRICADE WAS TO STOP THE BANDITS, NOT THE POLICE CARS. [TELEPHONE RINGING] I'M BUSY! THAT'S A LIE. OK, BEN, LISTEN. THIS IS MAN TO MAN. YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME. I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF A PROBLEM. I SAID I DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM! [SIGHS] OK, DID YOU SEE THE DOG? HER NOSE WAS COLD? YEAH, YEAH. CALL ME. I THINK THE OPERATION NEEDS A KICK IN THE BUTT. I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF YOUR COMMENTS, MR. BENDER. YOU BETTER DO MORE THAN THAT, MR. BAIRD. I'VE GOT AN AUTHORIZATION FROM YOUR MR. SECRETARY. THE CASE IS MINE. WHY DON'T YOU GO FISHING? THAT'S A VERY NASTY RASH YOU'VE GOT, MR. BENDER. YOU REALLY SHOULD TRY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. RONNIE? [LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [BOTTLES CLINKING] [CHATTERING] WHAT DO YOU WANT?

LOOK, IT'S A ROTTEN BUSINESS, WILL, AND YOU'RE BETTER OFF OUT OF IT. I SAID I'D GO. WE COULD ALL GO RUN AWAY, MARGOT. THINK, WILL. WHAT ABOUT ME? THERE'S NO ROOM ON THE BIKE. MAYBE IF IT HAD A SIDE CAR. [SIGHS] YOU USED TO THINK IT WAS GREAT. THAT WAS HALF WHAT WAS GREAT ABOUT IT. YOU'RE SO STUPID. YOU'RE SO STUPID, YOU CAN'T SEE THINGS HAVE CHANGED NOW. WILL, DO YOU NO KNOW THAT I...? MARGOT, DON'T GO. YOU'LL GET COLD. MARGOT. OK. EASY. YEAH, WE'VE HAD OUR EYE ON YOU. WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND? Doll: MOMMY!

IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFEREN BALLGAME NOW, ANYWAY. YOU'RE PROBABLY BETTER OFF OUT OF IT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TOMORROW? WE'RE GONNA PU THE BOOT IN. I'M GONNA GET MYSELF SOME STATUS. IT'S THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE, RONNIE. LOOK, PENNYCOOK. WE COULD GO INTO HIDING IN PENNYCOOK. NOBODY WOULD FIND US. WE COULD WEAR DISGUISES TO GO TO THE SHOPS. MARGOT, SHE SAID TO ME, "DON'T YOU KNOW I...?" LOOK... I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOU AND YOUR WOMAN! YOU JUST HAVEN'T GO A CLUE, HAVE YOU? WHAT DOES THAT SAY? BEATTY. RIGHT. SO, WHAT'S MY NAME? RONNIE!

MR. BAIRD. WHAT? TELEX FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE. "OPERATION BANDIT." GET BENDER. HE'S GONE. AYE? EVERYTHING'S CHANGED. THEY'RE HERE. THEY'RE RIGHT HERE IN THE TOWN. Big Country: ALONE AMONG THE HILLS AND STONE THROUGH SUMMER SUN AND WINTER SNOW THE EAGLE HE WAS LORD ABOVE AND ROB WAS LORD BELOW [HORN HONKING] 240 YEARS WE LIVED WITHOUT HOPE AND WITHOUT PRIDE SO, WHO WILL KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM? WHO WILL RAISE THE TORCH FOR THOSE WHO DIED? I WILL BE WITH THEM IN THE SUMMER SUN AND THE WINTER SNOW THEY WILL COME AND CLOUDS WILL GO SHOW THAT WE ARE PROUD AGAIN THOUGH ALL WE LOS IN AUTUMN DAYS CANNOT BE BORN AGAIN STAND HERE BY ME UNTIL THE WAYS OF AGE AND YOUTH ARE ONE AND SAME I WILL BE WITH THEM IN THE SUMMER SUN AND THE WINTER SNOW THEY WILL COME AND CLOUDS WILL GO AND SHOW THEM WE ARE PROUD AGAIN AND I WILL BE WITH THEM IN THE SUMMER SUN AND THE WINTER SNOW THEY WILL COME AND CLOUDS WILL GO SHOW THEM WE ARE PROUD AGAIN ALONE AMONG THE HILLS AND STONE THROUGH SUMMER SUN AND WINTER SNOW THE EAGLE HE WAS LORD ABOVE ROB WAS LORD BELOW MARGOT? DEAR ME, WHA ARE YOU WEARING? OK, HOLD IT! NO, SUNSHINE. YOU HOLD IT. NO, JACK, YOU HOLD IT. [SCREAMING] MARGOT! WASTE HIM, RONNIE. LOOK AT ME. I'M BULLETPROOF MAN. COME ON, YOU! PUT THE BOOT IN.

AND NOW THAT WE'VE GOT YOU AWAY FROM THE EYES OF THE ADORING PUBLIC, LET'S GET THE MASKS OFF. WELL, SCOTTIE, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? JESUS CHRIST! [CHUCKLES] THERE'S BEEN A WEE BIT OF A CHANGE. YOU BETTER READ THAT. HUH? LISTEN, THERE'S A MESSAGE FROM YOUR LAWYER: YOU GOT THE DOG! HA HA! IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEM, YOUR LAWYER WILL PHONE YOU. I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS. IT'S NOT GOLD. IT WAS MEANT TO BE GOLD FOR HIS WARTS. [WAVES CRASH ON SHORE] OUT! COME ON, OUT! [SEAGULLS CAWING] I HAD A TELEX FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND. IT'S FROM THE SCOTTISH SECRETARY. IT SEEMS TOURIST SPENDING HAS GONE UP 15% SINCE THE START OF THESE ACTIVITIES. YOU'RE BIGGER THAN THE LOCH NESS MONSTER. GROSSLY IRRESPONSIBLE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR OF THE MOST FLAGRANT KIND! "LOW PROFILE," HE SAYS. "HANDLE WITH THE UTMOST DISCRETION. POLITICAL HOT POTATO." I CANNAE LET YOU GO. SO, IT WAS HERE IN A LAST DESPERATE BID TO ESCAPE THE TIGHTENING GRIP OF THE LAW THAT THE HIGHLAND HEROES PLUNGED TO THEIR DEATHS IN THESE STORMY SEAS. AND ALL THAT REMAINS IS THE BROKEN WRECKAGE OF THE JAPANESE MOTORCYCLE THAT CARRIED THEM THROUGH SO MANY DARING RAIDS. I THINK THAT'S TERRIBLE. NOW STREWN ACROSS THESE JAGGED ROCKS... I NEVER THOUGH IT WOULD END LIKE THIS. ...WITHOUT ANY PRETENSE OF CROOKEDNES. THERE WERE SCENES OF WILD EMOTION AS THE UNFORGETTABLE FIGURES OF THE CLOWN AND THE WOLFMAN SPED DOWN THE MAIN STREE OF THAT CITY. THE EXCITED CROWD COULD HARDLY HAVE IMAGINED THE DRAMATIC FATE WHICH AWAITED THE OUTLAWS. DURING THEIR BRIEF CAREER AS HIGHWAYMEN IN SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, THE CLOWN AND THE WOLFMAN CAPTURED THE IMAGINATION OF A WORLDWIDE AUDIENCE... THANK YOU. IT'S REALLY GOOD, THIS STUFF, YOU KNOW? YOU SHOULD TRY SOME. IT TASTES LIKE... THERE'S BITS DROPPING OFF OF THIS. LOOK, THERE'S BITS FALLING OFF MY ICE. THERE COULD BE A GERM IN THERE OR SOMETHING. I READ THAT... DON'T BE SUCH A BIG LASSIE. A COUPLE OF WEE GERMS NEVER DID ANYBODY ANY HARM. ANYWAY, WE ARE BIGGER THAN GERMS, YOU AND ME. PUT YOUR NAME ON THAT. IT'S TO YOUR FAMILY. [DONKEY BRAYS] "NEW MEXICO-- LAND OF OPPORTUNITY. WEATHER VERY NICE." THEY'RE VERY HOSPITABLE HERE, AREN'T THEY? VERY GOOD TO TOURISTS. WHEN CAN I SAY I WILL BE HOME? WELL, WE'LL HAVE TO WAI FOR A DECENT INTERVAL. HAVE TO WAIT FOR OUR BONDS TO MATURE AT LEAST. SAY CHRISTMAS. DO YOU THINK IT'LL BE OK TO GO BACK AT CHRISTMAS? RONNIE, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR THE DEAD. Man on TV: ALL THAT REMAINS IS THIS... [SHEEP BLEATING] A SAD, SODDEN REMINDER OF MORTALITY. WE MAY NEVER KNOW WHO THEY WERE. BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN: NOW NO ONE CAN TAME THEM. IS THIS THE END OF THE STORY OR THE BEGINNING OF A LEGEND? MEL HAMMER, "A.M. NEWS MAGAZINE," SCOTLAND. DO YOU BELIEVE IN GHOSTS? Big Country: THE DAY THEY HAD A PARTY RIGHT OU IN THE STREET FLAGS AND FLOWERS AND SINGING FOR THE HOMECOME HERO'S TREAT I SAT IN THE KITCHEN WITHOUT A FIRE ON THE RANGE I KNEW THIS HOUSE HAD LOST THE CAUSE TO EVER MAKE ME WARM AGAIN COME BACK TO ME THE DAYS ARE ALL TOO LONG COME BACK TO ME YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE GONE I WAS SO YOUNG AND FULL OF PRIDE AND YOU WERE WILD AND STRONG CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMEN CAPTIONED BY THE NATIONAL Big Country: ALONE AMONG THE HILLS AND STONE THROUGH SUMMER SUN AND WINTER SNOW THE EAGLE HE WAS LORD ABOVE AND ROB WAS LORD BELOW 240 YEARS WE LIVED WITHOUT HOPE AND WITHOUT PRIDE SO, WHO WILL KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM?
