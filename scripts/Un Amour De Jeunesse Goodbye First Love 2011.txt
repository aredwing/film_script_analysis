Short would be more convenient. - If you do it I'll leave you. No, if you'd leave me, I'd kill you, and then myself. Very convincing. Do you love me? I love you. Is that all? I adore you. Come on... When shall we meet again? - Don't know. Soon. Not tomorrow? This weekend I can't. Let's talk on the phone on Monday. See you soon then. Put this gun down right now. - You think so? Stop it. You'll wake up dad. I must tell you something. You won't like it. What then? I'll quit my studies. No, don't do that. My decision is made. I haven't been at college for months. You'll regret it the rest of your life. - I'll go crazy if I continue. I'm going on a trip with Julien and Mathias. To South America. When your father will hear it... you'll loose your apartment and don't get money anymore. I know, but I'll get by. - Really? Camille's coming along? If I leave, she'll jump into the Seine, she says. Claude? Have you heard the name Jacques-Emile Blanche? Very nice. Have it valued at Drouot's. Why sell it? I'd keep it if I were you. A friend of mine might be interested. How did you get it? - Inherited from my grandfather. My parents will be pissed of. But I have to sell it. I still don't have enough to go in september. Especially if we decide to stay longer. You put on some make up, didn't you? You don't have to do this for me. What have you done this week. I thought we'd meet. Did you go every night? Oh, never mind. I mostly met with Mathias and Julien to talk about our trip And last night I went to a very stupid party. Everybody was stoned and fucking around. I didn't take anything and fucked nobody. - Glad to hear. Because I love you too much. If so, why do you go to such parties rather than coming to see me? I don't want to become dependent. That would make it even harder. Camille, do you know how difficult it is to fall asleep without you... and not to see your face when I wake up? I can't live without you. - Just talk. Why don't you believe me? - Because your friends always come first. It's all about your trip. - Don't be jealous, that's ridiculous. Easy for you to say. You know I do nothing but wait for you. I work hard and always sleep at my parents. Have some fun. - I'm not in the mood. That's your choice. - Sure, because you don't care. What a curse! Why do you always want us to argue? I was so happy to see you, but you ruined everything. Sorry, I'm off. Sullivan? Come help me. Dad doesn't eat at home. No idea who he meets. Your brother's been home for just two seconds. Did anybody call me? - No. Oh yes, Delphine. For you bring her back her history book. Come on, don't be so sad. It doesn't do you good. - What? A boyfriend. - I'm happy. I can still sometimes bales? May I not be a little sad sometimes? Since you're with Sullivan you just cry. Only of joy. I'm just a little melancholic. - Before, you were always cheerful. It's been a year. Cut it. He's my great love. - You're 15, don't be silly. Don't get fooled by someone who doesn't care about you. What do you know? Go to the cinema or something. Practise sports. You're too skinny. Love is everything to me, my only reason to exist. Give me a break. Here comes your father. You're so cold. - I guess so. I'm just not as melancholic as you are. - I won't tell you anymore about him. Honey, would you get me a cup of coffee, please? It's always lukewarm. You should buy a better coffee-maker. - You could also drink coffee elsewhere. I'll put it in the microwave. - Go ahead. Snotnose. Thank you, darling. So, what are your plans for this weekend? I see. My Romeo... Sweetheart, my love... I thought it was over... that I would never see you again. Are you crazy? You know I love you. I love you so much. Where were you? Why didn't you call? You are so cruel. No argue now, please. You're so beautiful. I gonna eat you. Wait. You make me crazy. Where are we going? You don't want to make love now? - I thought so. You stay here. No. Why not? - Because you don't deserve it. That's true. We need to talk. - What's now again? Everything has been said. Come. I'm not your pet. - Yes you are. Come, let's cuddle. Why are you here otherwise? I've brought some homework to do. I have a maths test on Monday. Do you really think I'll leave you in peace? I'm going to rape you. - Mercy... Naughty girl. - Hi. - Hello. Everything alright, Julien? - This is Sullivan. He has a beautiful painting, perhaps by Jacques-Emile Blanche. We'd like to have your opinion. - OK. - Wait a little. The painting is nice, but it's not a good one. The signature is questionable. And it's too small. But it's genuine. - No, sincerely, it's not good. No regrets? - No. Paris - Caracas with TAP, Friday, September 10th at 18:40. Peekaboo. - Are you crazy? I'm sure I can jump inside from here. - Sure you do. Come down from that tree. Idiot. Let's choose our room. Nice. Perfect. - This is the child's room. Why pick the smallest when we could enjoy space? So I don't need to look for you at the other end of the bed. There's nobody here. This is my dream house. Hurry up, I want you. - Sex, always sex. You don't think of anything else. Won't you read a little for a change? We'll have time enough for serious things. Now we're young. If you say so... Won't you get up yet? Then I'll go shopping. Where've you been? Did you drive around the whole Ardche? Don't be like this. I told you I don't want to be alone. I can't trust you. I don't want you to leave. What should I do without you? You can't let everything depend on me. You should have your own life. We must have experiences we can share. If not... If not what? Afraid that you get bored? Maybe. And also that you get bored. I'll never get bored of you. You'll meet lots of girls over there and forget me. I'm not going there for the girls. I go there to work, to learn, to... to really find myself. Our relationship isn't worth anything? Am I nothing to you? - You know that. I love you. But you want to be everything. It's not possible. You're everything for me. I can't live without you. When you say that, I really want to break up. You're hard like a rock. - No, you're hard yourself. Me? - Yes, with your defiance and threatening. Come on. Get away from me. I'm tired of your whining. Because you don't love me anymore. - Once more and it's really finished. Yes, I'm going away for ten months. It's not the end of the world. Food is ready. Mustard? Goodbye, Sullivan. - Goodbye. Have a good trip. Cheer up. The time will fly. He falls ill and dies in 1924. Lenin leaves behind a will... in which he mentions his old comrade Trotsky. Camille, my sweet love... I'm writing after three days of travelling, three sleepless nights without staying anywhere, just changing to another bus. I miss you so much, it sometimes feels like I'm dying of love. Tomorrow I could call you, but I won't do it. Don't be angry. To hear your voice without touching you is hard enough. Your tears and queries break my heart. After a call I always feel so bad. And I think it's the same for you. My long silence will hurt you, but I can't share my experiences with you. How can I tell about my journey, when everything hurts you so easy? Everything I experience seems to go against you. But that's not true. I love you with all my heart, and this love is the most precious thing I have. I always carry it with me. Never forget it. Have a look if your father needs help. Since ten days I'm in the mountains... in an old cabin at a blue river which runs through the forest. A peaceful shelter, where the forest fills you. I feel an increasing distance from my Parisian life and my friends there. I'm lost on a quest for an utopian peace. In Paris I could hardly find balance. Everytime I manage to change, I come closer to my ideal self. But you don't let me go my way. You follow me everywhere I go. It's you I'm looking for when I kiss someone else. I think I love you, but I want you to disappear. I don't want to be anything for you anymore. It was a dream and I don't know if there's anything left of it now. The teachings of German philosopher Leibniz are... the topic treated in this story. In Voltaire's simplified vision, Leibniz proposes... that everything is good in the best of all worlds. What are you doing this afternoon? Reading? Maybe. Don't you have anything more fun? You need to take a step, now. Don't you think so, honey? September 13th, 2003 Ladies, you're late. You've got two minutes to get dressed. I'm getting mad of standing there for hours without doing anything. I don't manage to think of anything else. No, don't take my carpaccio! No. - Don't be cruel. It's not for you. It's the only thing I have for my dinner. So hands off. - What shall I eat now? Shall I starve? - Have some cheese. Here you go. Is there any bread? - No. Only Swedish Toast. Did you meet your father? We had a dinner last week. How's his girlfriend? I heard she doesn't talk so much. Don't question me like this. - I won't. What do I care? I'm just glad for him. Your concept has some qualities. You have an original vision you stick to. But... I see a fundamental problem. A student residence isn't a place for walk and spiritual growth. I like the way you're using the site. You want to work horizontally? All right. But it must be functional. Covered terraces, trees, a pond. Why not? Nice, that reflection. Like that bridge to the library. But where do the students live? There aren't enough rooms. And they are too small. Broom closets. Nice big windows, but they're still closets. Will students in winter want to walk two km to the dining room? All that water is at the expense of the common areas. It's more suitable for a retreat than for collective living. What you have created, is a monastery. A house should appeal to everyone... while art isn't required to fall in anybody's taste. Art is a private matter for its creator. A house is not. Art is created without concrete needs. Houses answer a need. People must be asked what comforts them. They dislike everything that affects their security and disturbs them. That's why they love houses and hate art. Four years and what? Only silence. Every day's a day without him. If only I had faith. But I've a call. Something to live for. Isn't only that great? Shit. - I was going to warn you. No. Why not? Therefore. I don't feel for it. Stop it, please, I don't like it. - That's ridiculous. You can sleep here if you want. But don't touch me. Is everybody here? Alexandre, would you close the door? Today I'd like to talk about the aspects of a certain thing. A thing that we call gleam. What aspects would this have it be? In fact, what is gleam? A very faint light. - Where can it come from? From a candle. - What else? A glimpse. A reflection? - Something that glistens. We can say a gleam of light. - Yes. Of twilight or dawn. We can talk about a gleam of dawn. Does it have a positive or negative association? Gleam... Is that something we want to see? How would you think about it, which form, kind of image? Can't we say it's what remains of light? What escapes from the dark. Well. In most cases, a gleam involves... both light and darkness. What do you think of it? This weekend I read a text by Tadao Ando... in which he said that in houses are no longer... spaces to be found where the light lives... or where it is born. Think about it that. Because that's what's missing in your concepts, in my opinion. Light is too obvious for you. Something's missing: This nuance that makes the difference. We could call it path. You approach the light too... literally, mechanically. When you could also express doubt with it. Start all over again. Consider the building from the inside. From the darkness, as if you start with a dark compound. Now everybody says a word which he associates with darkness. Don't think and don't try to be too original. Night. - Void. Secret. - Death. For me all these words are important in architecture. But I think of something that is related to all of them. The past? - Almost. Memory. BERLIN They asked again for an additional design. We sent it last week. Haven't they paid the first one yet? Excuse me. Laura, can you take it? About half is invisible. It's a kind of iceberg. Imagine this grid as the portrayal of an ideal city. Very organized, and perfectly reflecting the culture. "They are modestly, but functionally absorbing the world of imagery." DENMARK What I wanted to say: I like your new design very much. In your work is courage and wisdom visible that's rare for your age. Why did you choose architecture? I don't know. I wanted something that has to do with environment. I think I know what you mean. It's the only thing I can really go for. Why did you become an architect? - It was never the intention. I studied clarinet. But I got problems and had to quit. Do you regret? - Not at all. Musician is a good profession but it's too lonely for me. It would be a pity to leave without having a swim. I'd also like to show you this beautiful place. Before, nobody came to this beach between airport and industrial area. But since this complex is there, people from Copenhagen come here. It's a recreation resort that respects the environment. It's quiet to be so close to the airport. It's well protected from wind, let's check it out right now! For the first time I don't suffer from loneliness. The sky's clearing finally. Hello. - I'm ready in moment. What would you like to do? - Shouldn't we visit the Louvre? Aren't you tired of museums yet? - Quite the opposite. I'm just catching up. You never talk about yourself. I don't feel for tiring you. There're so many things more interesting. Is your life and family not interesting? I won't say so. But I'm separated now. It's quite difficult for me. When I'm with you, I don't want to think about it. My son Nils lives with his mother. You never see him? Of course I do, I go to Berlin every weekend. Except for the weekends with me. Right. Like you I don't want to look back at the past. The years before I met you were a great void. Nothing but grief. - You shouldn't talk like this. At your age nothing is in vain. Life's never what you expect. Your relationship to the world is always unpredictable. It's up to you to transform it to something deeper, more true. Only then you'll become yourself. Let us next time walk the same route in the Louvre... so everything gets its place. To settle things I use to do them twice. Take down the lights and put them in the storage room. Will the railings be removed? - No, that's in the file. They're still doing a good job. Camille, don't go out there! Don't be stupid. - Come on. The granite is perfect. - After almost a century. Great. Do you remember those floors in Dessau? And that wonderful cast. - Yes, beautiful. The pillar follows the line of the pipe. The water flows into the open drain. The pipe ended just two inches above it. Very beautiful, this combination of round and square. I hope you keep it, will you? - It's going to be like this... The pipe... And the drain. We'll restore the glass tiles, so that you see the water running. Then it looks like a drain. And we'll make sure that... the pipe doesn't touch it. The water is controlled but still flowing free. I'd like to restore the opening on the first floor, as I planned to. It's too dark, I think. - Not so loud! It is an embassy, not a bunker. Selma? Hello. Camille! How are you? And Sullivan? Is he still in South America? No, he's been back for a while. Thank God. If he wishes to take contact... - I'll pass it on. I want to change something with those windows. The vents should be somewhere else. - They don't want that. I don't care. They've drilled too deep. I'm sick of it. We had to break down a wall that was still good. Come here and have a look. You'll have to pay. Next week you'll get the contract through Anne. Sorry. Yes? I called Friday for a defective unit. You sent someone who fixed it. But three hours later, it failed again. I don't dare. Will you call me? Sullivan. Do you still have your flat? - No, I don't live in Paris. I've been in Marseille for three years now. But I'm here pretty often. To visit friends and my parents. And for the work too. I didn't come especially for you. - I guessed that. So you work? - As a photographer. Your big dream. - Small jobs for local newspapers. And I've started a crafts company together with a friend. That's what I live on. Do you like Marseille? - Yes. In Paris, I never really felt at home. I get depressed here. A friend owns a house by the sea. We spend almost every weekend there. Shall we take a walk? I'm working for a Norwegian architect. In a few years I hope to have my own agency. You're going to be an architect? I'm impressed! I'd never have guessed it. - What did you think I would be? No idea. I've never thought about it. Do you live around here? - In Bastille. But soon I'll move in with my boyfriend. Have you been together for a long time? - Quite long. I love him as much as I loved you, but not the same way. That relationship has made me stronger. I'm really sorry I made you so sad. You wanted to save your freedom. It seems so long ago. It seems like someone else, another life. Are you with someone? I've been with a girl but it's finished. I had affairs. - Affairs... Don't you have any? - No, not at all. What a petty. It makes me sad you say that. I didn't mean to hurt you. I was just talking. I gotta go. - Already? I have an appointment at seven o'clock. Then you'd better go now. I want to replace the concrete box with four galvanized metal elements. It should be smaller bins, of more human dimensions. Can you come? It's urgent. Plus strips of earth sown with fine grass. I'm bleeding. Bleeding? For how long? An hour. I've called the doctor. Indeed, a miscarriage. We'll have to do some more tests. My little baby, I already loved him. I know. Will you make me another one? - Of course. Why? I was ready. You've got all the time. You're still so young. No need to hurry. Yes. I'm so happy I found you. It's a miracle. No, I'm the lucky one. You are the light in my life. Hey. I was with friends and didn't watch the time. I'm meeting a lot of people this week. - I was almost gone. Thank you for waiting. What are you doing in Paris? - A painting job. I'm very busy at the moment. We won a competition. It's my first time as project manager. Earlier than I thought. Fantastic. Bravo. Let's move over there. But it's challenging. I'm not sure I can handle it. - Of course you can. Here it is. Chic. I almost forgot... I took them this summer. But please don't look at them now. As you like. Go to your architect now. What a bad film. - You think so? My goodness. Did you like it? - Very much. What did you find so good? The characters, dialogues, the story, simply everything. I don't understand you. It's so French. Annoying actors, too much talking, self-indulgent. Terrible. - You just don't understand it. You're not sensitive enough for such a film. It's useless to talk about it. I see you still have a monopoly on sensitivity. And we still never agree. We can only agree about having totally different tastes. On key issues we do agree. - I don't think so. But it's not important, I love you anyway. I'll always do, I don't know why. - Camille, stop it. It's true. What do you think? Are you letting me down? - I'd also rather stay here. It's you own fault if you go. You could just stay. Take good care. It's dangerous there. - In Sanaa in the north, not in Aden. I'll call you when I get there. Is anything wrong? Not happy to see me? I was thinking of you all week. Go somewhere for a drink? - I only want to be together with you. You and I together. But it's not possible. Well, it is. We even have the whole night. You're crazy... Isn't it what you wanted? Yes, but then? Tomorrow? What then? I've missed you so much. How could we live so long without each other? You broke up. Did you forget? No. I never stopped loving you. Not a minute, not a second. You're inside me, like a disease. Don't say that. That window doesn't open. There was a wire behind. We couldn't do any other way. But we said the cables would go there, in the old chimney. It's very much work to change that now. We don't have time now. - Look at the drawings. It was written this way and we'll stick to it. I have music with me. And blankets. Even dinner for afterwards. - After what? After making love. You're always hungry then. You've thought of everything. How is that bed? You're no longer that innocent girl from back then. My heart is still innocent. But you're unfaithful. You betray the man who loves you, whom you love. That's my business. I'm so glad to be with you again. The room of Lorenz's son. He lives with his mother. The guest room. That's where we'll sleep. It's me. Are you there? Or are you out? Someone at home? Nobody home? Nobody at all? Just answer if you want. I'll be silent. I'll try to call at your mother's. I just came home. For me? - Open it. Like it? Don't cry. I want to be together with you. Marry you. Have children. What's this? A negligee for you to undress me. I'll turn off the lights. - No. I want to be able to see you. I have to go. I want to visit my parents before I leave. When will you be in Paris again? - Not so very soon. Can't you come to Marseille? Would you like it? You could see where I live and meet my friends. Bye. It took the bus lane... and ignored several traffic lights. A typical case of 'On the run from the police'... on the slippery roads of the capital. I'm going to spend the weekend in Normandy at Anna's parents. When? Tomorrow? What about me? - You'll stay here. So you'll leave tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow. - Okay... Not very nice. I just came back. I cancelled a few times already. Once more she'll strangle me. And I'm not invited. - It's a girls getaway. Okay, okay. Great. - You say all the time 'okay'. Damn it, so. It's that jerk, I must take it. DELAYED 40 MINUTES DUE TO THE STRIKES REGULAR TRAIN TRAFFIC IS DISTURBED. IF POSSIBLE, POSTPONE YOUR JOURNEY. CANCELLED. Don't be sad. I've to work anyway. Try another time? Hello Madam. - Hello. I'd like a room for two nights. Here are the last pictures of the site. Could you please add them? I'm on holiday since yesterday. You know what I did? What then? - Nothing. Was that fun? - Delicious. Since your father's gone, I live again. He has his good sides. He couldn't hurt a fly. He's good deep inside. But in daily life... what an asshole. How could I endure him for 20 years... Now I just eat a little thing in front of the TV. Oh, I almost forgot... There's a letter for you. Who's still writing to you here? Camille. I dreamed of you last night while I was with another woman. You wanted a child from me. How can I get rid of that image now? I'm leaving you because it's too late or too early to start all over again. Because you're so far away from me and I'm already suffering too much. And because I still don't know how to live with this love I can't control. But I know the bond between us is stronger than time, I'm leaving you with the hope of meeting you again, one day when we're more free and more worthy of our love. Food's ready. Oh no. Don't say it's him again. Will you ever overcome him? Lorenz? Where are you? Am I interrupting? - Not at all. Shall we go to the Loire? - Right now? Yes, while there's sun. - I'll join you in half an hour. Okay. Take a stick for the snakes. And put a hat on. Translation: TheHugeAnimalFromTheNorth Proofreading / Revision: Fatmaster
