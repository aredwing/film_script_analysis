While the initial appeal the original conviction was sustained... after two years imprisonment, a new appeal was initiated. My client, Philip Anderson was wrongly imprisoned for more than two years. But today, the Supreme Court acquitted Philip of all charges. I'm sure you have many questions. Do you still trust the Swedish legal system? Yes, I'm glad I got a new trial. But I lost three years of my life. That shouldn't happen in a democracy. There's a price to be paid. - Will you claim compensation? - That's for later consideration. That isn't an unreasonable thought, but at this moment we're satisfied with this. Annika Bengtzon of "Evening Press". Can you explain why a lot of the testimony changed? That's a question for the prosecutor. I asked Philip. I'd like to hear his answer. - The court found me innocent. - That's no answer to the question. Can you say more about changes in the witness statements? You say that more like a fact than as a question. Philip was convicted on the basis of questionable evidence. - So you tell me. - What's wrong in the legal system? Director: Peter Flinth bRedaction "Evening Press"/b Annika, come to my office? What should I do about Philip Andersson? He can't go unpunished. - Annika, I want an answer from you. - I said "no". You might think about it. Spiken's going away. We need a new news editor. - I'm happy with my current position. - We work hard as reporters. So if you take over as editor you can work according to a schedule. - I work best at my own time. - You've so much more in yourself. What should I do about Philip Andersson? All the media were there. It isn't an exclusive. Only a short summary? - From what perspective? - Do you have proof he's guilty? - No. - Then he was wrongly convicted. - This is a short summary. - Annika? If you don't want it, I'll assign it to another. Who'll decide what you write. I'm a journalist, not a personnel manager. - What did Schyman say? - Nothing new. - And you? - Nothing new. Pity. You'd be a good boss. How did the press conference go? How does "cleared of all charges" sound? Not really the headline of the year. Check it out. This just came in. "Family death by gas after burglary, Costa del Sol". Gas? What can that be? They pumped gas inside and waited until everyone was unconscious. - Is that common? - Yes. My brother has a house there. But there are never cases of murder. - Will you take this story? - No, I'll do the school bus accident. Annika Bengtzon of "Evening Press". Are you Rickard Marmen? Yes. What can I do for you? - I'm relaying greetings from Berit. - Give her my greetings back. I've a question about the gas burglary last night. - Are you in Spain now? - Yes. Do you often heard about gas burglaries? It happens here like a conveyor belt. You have fire alarms, we have gas ones. A family died from that. - Died? When? - Last night. - Was it a Swedish family? - I don't know. - Do you know any more about it? - I only know they died. I must find out more. - Can I reach you at this number? - Certainly. Thank you. Spiken, here. - Thank you. - Guess what's inside? A football. When I started working here, Spiken was already the news editor. I don't know how we'll survive without you. Many of you will wonder who the new editor will be. So allow me to introduce you to the new editor: Patrik Nilsson. - Patrik, go ahead. - Thank you. I really enjoy working with you. It will be a great newspaper. - What do we have for tomorrow? - I have a bus crash in Skne. - Annika? - A dead family on the Costa del Sol. Spain? Is there a connection to Sweden? Usually gas burglaries don't result in deaths. - And Philip Andersson's press conference? - I've a written summary. A summary? This man was wrongly convicted for more than two years and you write a summary? People want to read that. It isn't an exclusive story. It will be in the news. "Wrongly Jailed" is always good. Or "Accused Innocent". Send it to me. I'll make something beautiful out of it. I won't steal it from you. Your name will appear on the by-line. Next point. Rickard, thanks for your help, but the article didn't go through. What? - The gas burglary... - Leave it at that. - They were Swedes. - Sure? It's Sebastian Soderstrom. Wait, wait, wait... Sebastian Soderstrom? - The hockey star? - Jesus. Come here. A year ago I did a special about him. You've found it. This is the World Cup. His career's been put on the back burner, but he still loves sports. - I'm not that old. - He went from hockey to golf. - Does anyone have any news? - Only we, from Berit's brother-in-law. - Are you sure? - The official channels haven't reported it. We put nothing on-line until the newspapers are printed. Sports should locate ex-teammates. Berit, you provide an official comment. Annika, finish up everything. Grab a suitcase. You're off to Malaga as quickly as possible. - Is that a problem? - No. Good. How did they die? What leads do the police have? And wrap it a bit quickly. Sports? - Sophia Grenborg. - Hi, Sophia is Thomas there? Yes, one moment. - Mama, I want to be with you. - I know, sweetheart. - You're just been with me all week. - Five days a week. I know, but you won't even notice I'm gone. Hope your frog isn't lost. - My frog isn't fun. Or Sophia either. - We don't say such things. - We're pleased we can help. - Thanks again. - Good day. - Hi, Kalle and Ellen. - Ellen, say hello to Sophia. - She's a little tired. Hello, Daddy. Come see what we bought for you. Shoes off before you come in. I'd sooner have had more than half an hour's notice. - I called you immediately when I knew. - You and your lousy job, too. - What do you want me to do? - Honey, could you just help? Of course. Good day. We were the first. Now we have to maintain that advantage. "Soderstrom's life of luxury". Color it up a bit. - Patrik, I've done this before. - I know. Find young people to interview. Not just retirees. - Have you already got hold of the police? - I'm going there now. Call me when you're done. Good? About 200 meters, turn right. At the end of the road, turn right. - About 200 meters, turn right. - This can't be it. - Now, turn right. - But... - Please, turn right. - I'm still just at the airport. - Please, turn right. Right. - Shut up, stupid thing. - Hi, I'm here for Niklas Linde. - Would you sign here? Annika Bengtzon? Niklas Linde. - I expected you an hour ago. - Yes, my GPS didn't cooperate. Welcome to the Costa del Sol, where the diversions change every day. - Have you arrange a guide. - Do you know one? What does a Swedish policeman do in Spain? I maintain contact with the Swedish authorities. It's not really my field, but I manage the contacts. - What can I do for you? - I need information about the Soderstroms. According to my source is a gas alarm is standard here. Didn't they have one? - Yes. - Was it broken? I'm not directly involved in the matter... But I understand the alarm worked properly. And the cause of death was gas inhalation? That was the initial assessment. - Are there any other indications? - A different gas than usual was used. What was that? - They used fentanyl. - What is that? Do you remember when the Russian police invaded the Dubrovka theater? Was that fentanyl? When hundreds of people died. - Is it often used by gangs? - No. Fentanyl is hard to come by. - So they were killed deliberately? - We can only speculate about that. Can it be a settling of accounts? I'm going to look for the number of the guide I mentioned. Why would anyone want to kill an ex-hockey player? Carita Halling-Gonzales, married to a Swede. We usually use her as an interpreter, but I think she'll be willing to assist. - I'm Carita. You need a guide? - Niklas Linde advised me to call you. - A small coffee, please. - Anything else? - No, I don't want anything. - Nothing more. Thank you. Where were we? I ask 43 euro an hour, plus expenses. Is that okay? - What do you mean expenses? - Gasoline, if we go in my car. - I have my own car. - Okay. - Did you know the Soderstrom family? - I never saw them. A terrible event. - Where are you going? - To the house of the Soderstrom family. Do you want to go in? - Can you? - Not if you hand around. I'll make sure you get in. Wait here. The burglars took everything of value with them. Here is where the family was found. The mother lay near the window. Don't touch anything, please. My condolences. - What did he say? - Sorry. I told him you knew the family. - There are the children's rooms. - You lied? - A journalist would have to pay much more. - You bribed him? I charge it as simply "various expenses". This is the children's room. This is the room of the little girl. I think she just wants to be alone. We'll wait downstairs. You must hurry, the investigators will be back. Would you also say goodbye to the older girl? - I'm sorry I don't understand. - The big girl. You want good bay? - The big girl? - Yes. - Yes, please. - This way. bSuzette's Room/b Who is Suzette? There's a teenager's room with "Suzette" on the door. Another child? Suzette Soderstrom is Sebastian's daughter who lives in Sweden. - The room seemed inhabited. - How do you know? - Do you have her number? - Why should I give that? - I just want to talk to her. - Good luck with that. What a shitty connection. Soderstrom like many Swedes spent a lot of time at the golf club. My knees no longer worked, So I started golf. - I can't with internet access. - That happens in Spain. I have a Suzette Soderstrom. Jannike Diana Suzette, 16 years. - Have you her number? - I'll look up the address. Soderstrom, Lenita Marika, 42 years. That would be her mother. Four adverse credit records, no phone. I'll see if I can find it here. - Have you found out anymore? - Have just spoken to Berit? - I asked her what to search for. - You could have called me. I was busy. - What do you have? - "Police suspect murder". - What? You're kidding. - It was no accident. Then we do "The deadly drama, minute by minute". - We'll need some pictures? - Yes. I took some photos. - Good. Was there anyone they knew? - Sebastian had a daughter, Suzette. - I'm trying to track her down. - No, we can do that. - Mind you with a Sweden family there. - I'll go to the Swedish club. Good. Try to arrange a minute's silence. - I will see what's planned. - Ask why it hasn't happened. - That always works for me. - I want to insist on a memorial? Yes. Then your best. Call me when it's over. Excuse me, what's going on here? We commemorating the Soderstrom family. That bastard. Let people mourn for the money they won't get back. Members, guests, friends of the press. Sebastian Soderstrom was a role model, a good friend and colleague. I ask you all to join me in one minute's silence... Sebastian, Veronica, My and Leo. - Thank you for coming. - Was that a minute? - Hello, Carita. - Rickard. - As beautiful as ever. - Rickard Marmen. Annika Bengtzon. We've already spoken to each other. Nice to finally see. Sebastian Soderstrom... People seem angry at him. Why? - Shall we sit down? - I'll get something to drink. - There was always something with Sebastian. - What do you mean? He wanted to do something new, so he started a number of projects here. People believed in his success, but he wasn't a good businessman. - He swindled money from people? - Only rich people. No, seriously. I think he didn't expressly do that. He wanted to introduce a new sport: Stick ball. Ever heard of it? - Never. - Just like everyone else. I think a lot of people lost money through his projects. Can someone have been angry enough to murder him? Who knows? It wasn't like people knew he hadn't invested his own money. - Why not? They were rich. - Seemed to be, yes. Sebastian had no money. Only his wife worked. Veronica was a lawyer. Why didn't anyone talk about Suzette, Sebastian's eldest daughter? She didn't really belong to the family. We never saw her. - They were never all together. - Does anyone know any more about that? Try Vibeke Jensen. She's Danish. She runs a riding school in Cancelada. Near San Pedro? I know her. Hello, is anyone there? Shit. Wait here, I don't have an interpreter. I hear it when you need help. Pardon. Can I help you? - Vibeke Jensen? - Yes. Hi. Annika Bengtzon. I'm looking for Suzette Soderstrom. You're writing about the accident? Yes, I'm looking for information on the family. Everyone could see something wasn't right. Tell me. They fought a lot, she and her stepmother, Veronica. - They quarreled? - Yes. She's come to live here when it was too much for her. I offered her a job. She was supposed to start last week. - Was she in Spain last week? - Yes. She called me the morning she was supposed to start. She said she had to go back to her mother in Stockholm. Of course she should have known, but it was quite unexpected. In hindsight I'm glad she went home. - Did you talk to her after-wards? - No. - Can I have her number? - No. Or the number of her mother? I just want to ask some questions. Suzette doesn't need to know about it if you don't want. Okay. - Hello? - Can I Speak to Lenita? I'm Annika Bengtzon of "Evening Press". Sorry about your ex-husband. Can I ask you some questions? I've nothing to say. - May I speak to Suzette? - She's not here now. - When she comes back? - She's in Spain, at a riding school. - Vibeke Jensen's? - Yes. - I'm there now. Suzette isn't here. - What is it? I thought Suzette was in Sweden. No, she's in Spain, at the riding school. Wait. Vibeke, I think you just need to talk to her mother. - Vibeke Jensen here. - Isn't Suzette at your place? Suzette Soderstrom is missing. The local police informed Interpol and they contacted us again. - What do we do now? - Of course we'll do our best. We'll check phone, passport and bank accounts to fill in the gaps. If she's here somewhere, we'll find her. There is no indication... Suzette left Spain. I still have no internet. Can you find out more about Suzette? Gas Murder. "Sportsman's Daughter missing, after family deaths". Get that straight. The search has revealed nothing. - Suzette had a blog. - Okay, wait a minute... - BlogSpot. Suzettesblog. - Thank you. Come. I'm Polly. That's me. Why didn't Suzette return to Sweden? - Her mother was upset. - Why did she do that to Vibeke? She's not here and not there. Where can she be? You're her best friend. No idea. The whole family's dead and she doesn't return my calls. - When did you talk to her? - Last week, via SMS. - When? - Monday, I think. She said her phone was broken and told me not to worry. - Can I have her number? - Yes, but it's turned off. I can always try. She tells her mother she's... at Vibeke's. And Vibeke claims she went home. - Has she run away? - Doesn't seem so. She disappeared two days before the murder. She's had a week or so to get in touch and hasn't used her passport. There must be some trace of her? I've got something you might find interesting. These are two of the men who broke into Soderstroms. They were found dead in their car. In our view, they're Romanians. - How did they die? - Overdose. Morphine. - It was in their beer bottles. - Who did that? We don't know. We have traces of two cars and three people. We don't know who the third was. Everything except the contents of the safe was found in their car. - Was that everything they took? - Everything seems to point to that. - I want an article in "Evening Press". - Pardon? Not about this. About something else. - I don't write anything on request. - Not even a good story? No, my boss isn't happy if I don't relate all the local atmosphere. Come with me tonight. Bring your camera along. I'll let you see the surroundings. If you want to write an article, go ahead. Please. A nice gesture from the Spanish police. Last week a truck full of cocaine left for Stockholm. Tonight another one departs. So I have to write about two intercepted trucks? No, we let the first go. But not tonight. Why do you want me to write the article? We're trying to smoke out a Swedish cop, but he is on his guard. If he gets wise to this, he'll disappear and we can begin again. But a boastful article can help us lure him out in the open. So you want him to think you only knew about one truck? - Spanish drug seizures aren't news. - But we'll nab the courier. That makes no difference. Even if he's Swedish? We don't know if there will be any security or if he comes alone. Good? - How do you know about tonight? - We tapped his phone. What's his name? The courier? Johan Martinez Zarco, or: Jocke. He's 26, born in Sweden. Understood. The truck was seen now just wait. Step back. And stay there. Hey you. You there. What are you doing? Give me that phone. Give me. Give me that camera, dammit. Police. Easy. - Shut up and lie still. - Swedish? I'm a Swedish citizen. What's this about? I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I told you I'm Swedish. No photos. - Okay? - Yes. - Will I get my article? - I don't know. That's not up to me. Know what? We'll have a beer. It won't get the front page. I understand my new boss. It seems incompetence is a requirement. Then you've got Patrik. - What? - Continue. - What is it? - Continue. Do you talk about other things than work? Do I too much? Where are you talking about? - Annika here. - This is exactly what I meant. "The dark side of luxury lifestyle". "Cocaine Coast. " A whole series. But if the whole series, I'd have to send a photographer. - Good job, Bengtzon. - But you... They'll take the article. We're a good team. Good morning. - Annika. - Have you received my mail? - You're also good morning. - I have a new idea: "Cocaine Coast, the villain and the hero. " Can you interview that courier? I think so. I have a good informant. - I'll just catch that hero. - It's all arranged. A conference on drugs opens today in Malaga. You'll interview an expert. - What's his name? - I'll text you his name. - And then Suzette? - Cocaine Coast is your story. - There's a 16-year-old girl missing. - We've already written about that. I'll send a photographer. You pick her up at the airport. - Who? - Lotta. She's new. Better I couldn't adjust as quickly. - She's not a temporary worker? - It goes down very well. Thanks, Patrik... Are you Lotta? I'm Annika. You have a lot of stuff with you. - Is the hotel far away? - One hour. But we won't go there. - I have to charge my flash. - We have an interview in 3/4 of an hour. Is it such a tight schedule? Niklas scheduled it. We have only five minutes. And no cameras. - Why was I sent then? - Don't you have a small camera then? - This is unethical. - You shouldn't bring anything inside. I don't like to impose myself on others. Please only one wide angle picture. "A Swede locked up here". - Search is an unfortunate angle. - I am the photographer. - Who are you? What is it? - This is Annika Bengtzon, journalist. Damn, it's you. You took those pictures of me. - I write articles... - I won't talk to you. - They'll think I talked. - It can be anonymous. - You shouldn't write about me. - I can tell your story. My story? Are you crazy? That only makes it worse. - What? - Why what? They will... They'll murder me. Don't you understand? The people who you work for? Who are they? - Do you use drugs yourself? - Are you, my therapist? I'm not a junkie. Help me out here. Help. They will murder me if they hear, just like the Soderstrom family. - The Soderstrom family? - Can you hear me? Sebastian... Did you know him? Is that why he was murdered? If you tell me now, I'll do everything to help you. APITS Get me out and I tell you. Sir, I receive the package. I have the content, of the safe, you required but... - I'm afraid the accounts are missing. - Are you cure? Yes, yes... I look for everything. Those papers are not here. Just find them! - Was Soderstrom involved in drugs? - Not that I know of. - What's this about? - Where are you going? I need to talk. I'm at a conference on drugs in Malaga. You're kidding. I have an interview. See you in fifteen minutes? It wasn't easy to get a good picture. But I did it. Look. - What is the prison? - Don't you see? Behind these men. The article is about a boy who ended up in hell. What's that got to do with these men playing chess? I can't just shoot the building. You should put something in the foreground to create perspective. - You want to come with me. - Hello. Was Sebastian involved in drugs? - Jocke talked about him. - What'd he say? They will murder me like they did the Soderstrom family. Annika? Thomas? What are you doing here? - You have the children. - They are with Sophia. - Why did you hear about nothing? - It was your week. Still, you can tell me. I'm here for a conference. I have an interview. It's you, of course. - Are you the hero who Patrik found? - Hero? - I can't interview you. - Yes, that would be uncomfortable. Niklas Linde. Narcotics. He works here. - Thomas. - Niklas. So... - Do you have time to talk? - Of course. Good luck with that conference. - Who was that? - My ex-husband. Jocke said something. Well, he wrote it. APITS. Any idea what that might be? APITS? That's the warehouse where we picked up him. I'd like to go there. Well, I'm done here. We can go in my car. - Is that your photographer? - From the "Evening Press". - You can have her. - I prefer journalists. - Here stood the truck. - Beautiful surroundings. This is a company called APITS Depsito. APITS Transporte is the owner of the truck. Who's the owner of APITS? It is registered in Gibraltar, but not nationally. Making it a part of Europe attractive to smugglers. Gibraltar and Morocco are close, and the coast isn't well guarded. It's a crime scene. We must touch nothing. Sorry. I'll work around it. - APITS Does it do anything else? - No. There is a web domain name, apits. com, but there's no user. - Can I quote you? - No. I want to remain anonymous. How about: Sources at the Spanish police. That's perfect. I didn't expect to find anything good on the Costa del Sol. - Good. - Thank you. It's a profession, but I wouldn't do it the rest of my life. Photography is an art. It is more real than journalism. Newspapers retell other people's experiences. They create nothing. - But art touches people. - What nonsense. So the news has never touched you? Only seniors playing chess? What are you doing here? It was a bit weird just now. I wanted to know how you were doing. - What? - My boss asked for the interview. - What do you say? - What? Let's go eat? I'm busy. I have to figure out how the gangs launder drug money. Another time then? And it didn't occur to you... That to ask an economist who engages in drug laws? And who asks you out to dinner? It's very simple. You want a receipt of where the money comes from... - So you must sell something. - Whatever? In theory, yes. In Sweden, the hospitality sector has a free hand. But here it's even easier. Property. Houses are very expensive. Sell a few houses, and you can easily declare that money. Some houses are bought... And sold again. Back and forth without the residents moving. Why isn't this sector under the microscope? Why are companies registered in Gibraltar. - They have no records. - There's nothing to see. - I didn't know you knew. - You never asked. Hi, Kalle. Very good. What? Yes. Guess, there's someone you want to speak to. - Hello, sweetheart. - Mama? I miss you. Me too. Is Ellen there? - She's asleep. - You would also need. - Are you going to marry Daddy? - No... I won't marry Dad again. Go to bed. I love you. I love you too. Kisses. Good day. It was fun. No, I can't do. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. They will murder me. Don't you understand? Help me, damn it. Soderstrom - drugs? What was there in the safe? We're trying to smoke out a Swedish cop, but he's on his guard. We are an hour away from Morocco. Most of Europe's hashish is produced there. - Who's the owner of APITS? - It's registered in Gibraltar. That's why companies are registered there. No administration. Hello, Rickard, I'm Annika Bengtzon I'm looking for a Swedish lawyer... Working in real estate in Gibraltar. - Do you happen to know anyone? - Yes, but she's now dead. - Who? - Veronica Soderstrom. I told you? Hello? - She had an office in Gibraltar? - Yes, that's right. - OK, thank you. - Anytime. Hello, I came because of Veronica Soderstrom. - Niklas here. - Veronica hadn't anything to do with drugs. Her agency's in Gibraltar called "A Place In The Sun". A- P-I-T-S. You have a visitor. Veronica's office was a front company. - Her own house was for sale. - I'll check into Veronica Soderstrom. Good. Look for a link with APITS carrier. - A- P-I-T-S. - I'll call you when I have something. Wait. Someone called. Polly Sandman? Polly? She'd call me when she heard from Suzette. I received an e-mail. I couldn't contact the police. I'm sure it's her. Suz is alive. - And Fatima, who is that? - Her second mother. She has a riding school where Suz often spends the summer. Look. - Is that Fatima? - Yes. Where is that riding school? Polly? Asilah. Those riding school is in Asilah. - Is that close by? - It's in Morocco. Carita here. Leave a message. Carita, I found Suzette in Morocco at a woman called Fatima's. I don't know exactly where, but I want to go there tomorrow. Call me back. Of course. Thank you. I seek it out. Yes. - I found Suzette. - Sit down. - She is in Morocco. Polly said... - Carita When you talked to? - I just got a message was left. - Jocke Martinez is dead. He was found dead in his cell. - How? - A overdose. Morphine. - How did he get that? - I thought you might know. - Me? How? - Only you and Carita saw him. - Five minutes only. - What did Carita say? Barely anything. We spoke in Swedish. Did you know she had an appointment today with Jocke? - Today? - Carita was just with him. She was on the list, so she was admitted. She arrived at 13.05. Jocke was brought down to the visiting room. We think she bribed the guards to be allowed into his cell. She left at 13.20. At 14.15 Jocke was discovered dead in his cell. Carita must have given him the morphine. I'm going to Sweden? Seriously? Jocke died from an overdose like the two Romanian burglars. Do you think there's a connection? We think that has to do Carita with the murder of the family Soderstrom. - Why? - We think she was the third person. - Who did she work for? - Someone in the drug trade. - Why would she do it? - Blackmail, threats or money. - Yes? - It happens. - I told her where Suzette is. - Is she at the stables? Yes. I can't do anything else. Good day. - I'll call the Moroccan authorities. - It can take a long time. - We're going now. - I won't step on a boat to Morocco. Do you know there are consequences... Do you suddenly think about rules and regulations? I got inside that prison. Do you know how much trouble that caused? - You can write about anything here. - This is about Suzette. Leave it to us. We're now concentrating on Jocke Martinez. Stay here until that's resolved. We'd like to ask officially. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. bTangier, Morocco/b - Are we really okay? - Yes. - Just outside Asilah? - Yes. I know the road. - It's me. Do you have anything? - Hello? I hear you. - Hello? Where are you? - Is that Annika? - Bad connection. - Give me that. - Sorry... - Why not answer when I call? - I'm busy. Can I call you back? - Lotta says you have left. - I hope you have a good story. - Hello. The connection is very bad. I'll call as soon as I can. - I know where it is. - OK. We are here, madam. Just a moment. - Yes? Who's there? - I'm Annika Bengtzon. I'd like to speak to Fatima. I'd also like to speak to Suzette. Are you all right? I just want to talk, nothing more. Open the door. - Stop. - Your bag. Give me that bag. Camera, phone, passport. - Hup. - Hurry. Over there. Stay there. You wanted to see me? - Are you Fatima? - I am Fatima! My name is Annika Bengtzon. I work for a newspaper... I know who you are. Why are you come here? - Suzette is here? - Why do you think? She came here in summer often. For horse riding. - What do you want from her? - I would like her to speak. I was very moved by what has happened. - Who knows you're here? - My editor. You're lying. Nobody know you're here. Take her to the guesthouse. We'll talk tomorrow. For now... you'll stay here. As our guest. No, listen. They know she's here. The people who's kill her family, they know she's here. - I do not know how. - Take her. Fast. Please, madam. Keep moving. Here it is. Suzette? You write for a newspaper anyway? - Why are you here? - I'll see if you're okay. They can't keep you. You have to leave. Nobody loves me here. I want to stay here. Do you know what this place is? How did you come here without a passport? Fatima has her own boat. - Everyone is looking for you. - Nobody cares. They think I'm too expensive and I stand in the way. Only Fatima cares about me. She was afraid this would happen if that man was released. - She just wants to protect me. - Who?
