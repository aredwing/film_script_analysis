Worried about me, are you, Bridget? ( chuckles ) No way, just leaves more tips for me. Order up! Sophie! I was coming! All right, guys. Here you go. Amber, relax. It's her first week. She's doing fine. - Yeah. - Stop stressing. - Sorry about the wait. - Mmm. Oh! Watch the merchandise, fellas. I'm saving it for my wedding night. That's OK. I don't wanna buy it. I just wanna lease it for tonight. ( chuckles ) Sorry, but you and I both know you can't afford it. Oh! So, you're new here or what? I'm Sophie. I just moved to the city a couple months ago. I'm staying with my sister. OK. You should come stay with me. ( chuckles ) Yeah, come on, baby. Bridget, can you cover for me? Is there a problem, here? Nothing I can't handle! OK. Well, you've had enough, so I'm gonna cut you off. Amber, it's fine, they're just joking around. No! He knows the rules! It's hands off! - Aw! - Amber! ( shouting ) Come on, big boy. Oh! OK. ( choking ) Bridget! Do something! Set up some shots. All right, boys! That's enough of that! The action's over here. Bring it in. We're gonna have some free drinks on the house, right now. ( cheering ) That's right! That's what I'm talking about! Yeah! Shots? ( thumping on counter ) Woman: Shots, shots, shots...! Woman: Yeah! ( cheering continues ) Oh! Hi, babe! It's quiet in here. Amber started a fight. Amber started a fight... and I missed it. Did anybody film it? Yeah. Sweet! Oh, nice! Babe! ( chuckling ) Hey, Soph! OK. What happened this time? Ask the warden. This warden? I messed up tonight. Hmm, I'm sorry! I had it covered. You know, I'm not a kid anymore. Both: Yes, you are. If I wanted my every move watched, I would've stayed back home with mom and dad. Hmm! So, what's up? Well, I am happy to announce... that the legendary... Jenner Branton's streak of bad luck is officially kaput. I got us a super sweet online deal... for a romantic, weekend, getaway. - Really! - Uh-huh... Where to? There's some new vacation spot on some island off the coast. - Red Plum Island. Heard of it? - No. It's supposed to be beautiful there, though. Clear skies... clear waters... there's a campsite... a marina... you and me, under the stars... snuggling by the fire, mmm... - Me like! - Uh-huh. - But what's the catch? - No catch. I... I just thought that we could bring Sophie along. Jenner: Look. I know that things have been really tense... since she moved in with you... and I just... I don't know, I just thought... you know? It'd be a good... a good opportunity to have some fun... for a change. Thank you. Plus it was a lot cheaper when I signed us up for a group rate. Ah! OK, yeah. Soph! What do you say? The three of us? Great outdoors... Sure, sounds like fun. And I don't work again till Monday. ( slaps ) Perfect! Well, looks like you've got yourself a date. Two dates. Actually... we need four... to get the discount. What? ( sighing ) - How is it looking, Roger? - ( chuckles ) Ah, well, it looks like it took a few stray rounds from last night's little episode. It's totally busted. - Can you fix it? -( sighs ) Yeah, I can fix it. There's a lot of delicate equipment. I'm gonna swap parts out for though, but I should get it back online. It's gonna take a while, though. ( sighs ) Just get it done. It may be the only shot we've got at finding the damn thing. Or solar sonar? No. Where the hell is Cage? Here, ma'am. Did you find the test subject? My men have been out all night, combing the waters. So far, we've come up with nothing. I'm pretty sure it's dead, ma'am. I don't wanna hear about pretty sure. I need the thing dead! Do you understand the magnitude of what it is we're dealing with here? When Congress gets wind of this! We need to minimize the damage. With all due respect, Dr. Palmer, I was brought on as Chief of Security. I wasn't aware that I was going to be chasing monsters. You're here, Sergeant Cage, because I was told you were the best. Are you or are you not? Yes, ma'am. Find the shark. Before something worse happens. Hello! This is Jenner Branton. Yeah, I was just checking about our reservations for this weekend. Just-- Great! You're a lifesaver. Jenner: I couldn't find reservations anywhere! It's James here, on The Tiger. This just coming in from the National Weather Service. Looks like we've got a severe storm advisory for tomorrow. Strom clouds are expected to move in And I'm happy, she'll be happy. ... by mid-morning, with high winds, and heavy rain... hitting the Coast before moving west along the Gulf Coast, later tonight. That is, if the current weather pattern holds. Everyone is advised to stay inside. I'm just finishing loading up the boat right now... so, we'll see you guys pretty soon. ...while we wait out the storm. All right. Well, we'll see you then. All right. Thanks again. Bye. ( sighs ) ( phone rings ) ( birds chirping ) Hey, Mrs. Steele! What's going on? What's this Sophie tells me about you taking our girls... to some deserted island for the weekend? Ah... It's Red Plum Island... and it's not deserted, there's people there. Mmm, sound suspicious to me! Tell him I know where he lives. Ross has issued the first of many death threats. Don't worry. Your girls are in good hands. Scout's honor. We missed you and Amber... at Memo's birthday party last week. Yeah, I know. Um... You know, we tried, um... but Amber had to fill in for a friend at work-- You don't have to make excuses for her. I'm working on her. Don't you worry. - I know you are. - I gotta go to the shop. - I'll be back in a bit. - Bye. You take care of my girls. Mrs. Steele: The next time you decide to whisk my only daughters... off to some deserted island-- It's not deserted. Just... give me a little more warning. OK. Well, how about... we just call you when we get settled into the cabin, OK? OK. - Be careful! - All right, bye, Mrs. Steele. This is nice, babe. - I get boyfriend points, huh? - Definitely. All right! ( Amber chuckles ) Hey, what is that place? Um... Creepy? Looks abandoned. Hey, is that where we're going? Yeah, they said we each get to pick out one to stay in. I'm joking, Bridget. That's not camping. That's the north side of the island. That's where all the rich people build their summer homes. See, now that it's getting colder, most of them have already headed back to the mainland. See up here? We're headed to the south side. Wow! Very nice, babe! I'm impressed! What did I tell you, right? Mmm, I guess the bad luck streak is over. Mmm... ( Amber chuckles ) Jenner: Let's go! Uh! What is this? Thought y'all said we were staying at a resort. Did I say resort? I am... um... I don't think I said resort. What did you expect? Um... How about...? full body massages, spas... little cabana boys, running around, waiting on me hand and foot. I can't afford that on my salary. Well, I think it looks awesome. We can do a little fishing, walk along the beach... It'll be perfect. Good. How are you? Hi! I'm Jenner Branton. You must be... Santa Claus. Jenner: Psst! Hello? There's your cabana boy, Bridget. Jenner: Um, a party... of four. Sophie: Reminds me of dad, I think he'd like it here. Hey, you are the one with all the good memories of mom and dad. There's still time, you know? They just don't know you anymore. Reality check, Soph. They never knew me. Besides, they have you. You are a much better daughter than I ever was. ( Jenner whistles ) Hello? Hello? Okie-dokie, I think he's broken. Are you there? - Anything? - Um, we're checking in. I don't know if they told you guys that we have four people coming in for Jenner Branton. Oh, crap! Don't, don't; get out of here! How many times have I told you to stay away from behind the counter. And if it happens again, I'm calling the sheriff. ( laughing ) Sorry about that! Homeless man, always coming in here. Hey, look, I wanna apologize for keeping you all waiting. I had breakfast burritos this morning. And I'll tell one thing, they gave me the squirts. ( laughs ) Anyway! What can I do for you kids? Um, I'm Jenner Branton. Oh! Mr. Branton! Of course. Um... ( clearing his throat ) Welcome to Red Plum Island where all your dreams come true. ( solemn ) My name is Lester and I'm here to attend to your every need. ( chuckles ) If you could just get your signature, here. I'll get your keys. Thank you so much. We saw your cabins. Well, there'll be more cabins soon. Still working on expanding the guest accommodation. What did you say your name was? - Lester. - Lester, nice to meet you. Hey, so... like, what is there to do around here? Oh, well, um... We have swimming... boating, fishing, parasailing, but only on Saturdays. There are trails that go deep into the woods... that are perfect for hiking. And we have a brand new Redbox kiosk... outside of here, if you want to watch a movie. And it's the only one on the island. I'm pretty proud of that. And of course, after the sun goes down, I do a little dinner show over in our rec room. Well, I grill, make cocktails... I tell you, it gets pretty wild up in there. Cocktails? Do you have a bar? Do we have a bar? ( laughing ) The bar! Jenner: Cool! Um... Where's the bartender? At your service! ( laughing ) This is perfect, Lester. Thank you. OK. Well, I'm gonna head to the beach. It's a little cold outside to be tanning. If the sun's out, I'm out! This body wasn't meant for covering, anyway. She does have two points. So... I'll see you guys later. Sophie: Hey, Lester... What's that little boat at the pier down the beach? We saw it when we came in. Oh! You must be talking about the base. You know, it's not sure what went on over there... but rumor has it they were doing lots of testing... developing chemical warfare... new kind of mustard gas or something, I don't know. They closed down in the 70s. You know, there are old stories... about how the south would fight off the sharks that the current would bring down. Wait... Sharks? Well, sure! In some of those old stories we were nicknamed Shark Island. Wow! That doesn't sound ominous, at all. Look, I've lived here my whole life, and I've never seen a shark. So trust me, you have nothing to worry about. Man: Check that out. Should we go over? What do you think? Man 2: We should call Danny. Guys, seriously? Take a picture, it lasts longer. Man 1: That's what I think it is, right? It must've washed up last night. Whoa! People used to talk about how this marina was the place to be. But they closed down the base... and eventually built another marina over on the north island. So all of the wealthy people build their luxurious homes over there now. We saw that. But I have hopes of growing this resort... and putting the south island back on the map. ( chuckles ) Hey, guys! You've got to come see this! Do you believe it! Bridget: Isn't it awesome? Jenner: Wow! This is so awesome! Sophie: It's a little gross. I wonder what happened to it. Amber: Jenner, don't touch it! I'm just looking at it. Jenner: Look at this hole! Jenner: Looks like it's been bitten by something. Like what? Probably another shark. Jenner: No! I don't think sharks bite other sharks. Do they? I don't think so. But I know one thing, this is going on Instagram. Bridget, could you just... don't? Baby. Take it easy. It's dead. It's not gonna bite her. No... This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We should document it. No. She is right. That's a good idea. I'm gonna take a picture for Lester's website. Maybe that'll bring some customers in. ( laughs ) Get away from there! My bad, man. Sorry about that, sheriff. We were just...ah... taking some pictures for Lester's website. We didn't mean anything. ( screaming ) Amber! Run! Mayday! Mayday! Ah! Please, please, please! Get me out of here! We've got to go! ( crying ) Bridget, untie us! Keys! Keys! Where are the keys!? Oh, my God. Jenner had them in his pocket. What does that mean? It means this boat isn't going anywhere. No. No! Someone call the sheriff. No, no, no! No, don't come! No! No! The storm's starting up out there. It's all over the news. Straight-line winds. Rain. They're telling everyone to stay inside. Yeah. They'd be right. I had no idea there'd be a storm this weekend. You think the girls are okay? They'll be fine. Jenner still hasn't called. Shouldn't they be on the island by now? Will you leave them alone? You can't shelter them forever, Davina. You've reached Jenner. I am a little tied up at the moment. But if you leave a message, I will call you back as soon as I can. Thank you much. No answer. Sophie is not answering either. Or Amber. That's typical. What if something happened to the boat? Are you listening?! They're not answering their phones! Well, maybe they are on the boat, and they can't hear you over the motor. Maybe there's no reception where they are. Sky's not always falling, Davina. I knew something like this would happened. Enough, okay? We raised two strong girls. They'll be fine. That shark was dead. We all saw it, right? It couldn't have been. It doesn't make any sense. We need to call the coastguard, or something. Hey... I'm sorry about Jenner. Amber: Bridget, call for help! Bridget: Call who? I've one bar and no Internet. Ouch! Amber: We're drifting away from the dock! What do we do?! We gotta get off the boat! Wait, wait! Stop, stop! We're trapped! Guys... The motor is destroyed. Bridget: We're screwed! Sophie: Amber, what do we do? The radio. ( screams ) Hello?! Hello?! Is anybody there? Mayday! Mayday! We need help! We're in Red Plum Island Amber: Mayday! Mayday! Can anyone hear me?! This is a restricted access military channel. - You need to contact the local authorities on the island. - They're dead! There's a shark washed up on shore and it's eating people and it's after us. Can you hear me? Hello? It's him, Sergeant Cage. Copy that. Hang on. We're coming to get you. Hello? Can you hear me? Come in. Come in. Damn it, damn it. I think the radio is dead. Come on! We need to go now! Come on! Sophie: He's still there. How are we going to get through? Okay, I'll create a distraction and you guys run. No! Don't argue with me right now! Just be ready. Hey! Hey! Over here! - Go! Go! Come on! - No! Come on! Amber, come on! Oh, yeah. Okay. Cheers! We were there... okay? And... we're flying at 10,000 feet. And what did she do? - Totally freeze. - Totally freeze. The pilot had to take us down. But to my defense, we got a full refund. Besides, I said I was sorry. It's okay. Except the fact that you're boring. - What? - I love you anyway. What? I can be crazy! I defy you to name one crazy thing that you've ever done. How about skinny-dipping? That water is ice cold. No way you would ever get in there. Yeah? ( laughing ) No way. ( laughing ) I take it all back! You're a crazy girl! Steph? Stephanie! Stephanie! Steph! Steph! ( screaming ) Whoa! What happened? I heard screaming down on the beach and I tried calling the sheriff-- He's dead. Amber, it's fine. I'm okay. What happened? There was a shark attack. Where's Mr. Branton? He's gone too. Crap. I dropped my cell phone, somebody call 911. We don't have 911 on the island. The most we have is the sheriff, and volunteer fire and EMTs. If you want anything else, you've got to wait for the mainland. But I don't think they're gonna come out with this storm coming. There's a storm? Yeah, a big one. It's been on TV all day. You didn't hear? No. I talked to someone from the military over the boat's radio. I feel like they are the only ones who can help us at this point. We need to try to get back in contact with them. Do you have a a CB or...? - Maybe one in the back. - Okay, okay. What good is that gonna do? You said there's no one to call! It's just worth a try. Can you please go help him. - Why me? - Bridget. What is your problem? I can take care of myself, you know? Yeah, so you keep telling me. On the dock, you should have left me. I was fine. But instead, you came back and it could have gotten you. But it didn't. But it could've! We already lost Jenner, we can't... I can't lose you. It's better me than you. Eventually, you're going to have to stop living in the past and forgive yourself. Look what we found. Oh, my God. Great. - Try that. - Okay. Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me? There's a shark on the shoreline and it's killing people. Who is this? Are you with the military? My name is Dr. Diane Palmer. What is your name? Amber Steel. Where are you, Miss Steel? We are on the marina. Where is the shark now, Miss Steel? I don't know, it... It attacked our boat and then it swam away. Listen to me carefully. Is the shark dead? Did you kill it? Are you kidding? No, we didn't kill it. It ate my boyfriend, and it killed the sheriff. Its face was... It looked like it had been dead for days, but it was still moving. Sit tight, Miss Steel. I'm sending a professional to deal with the situation. Everything is gonna be okay. - Over and out. - Amber: No, no, no! Hello? Hello? Wait? Oh, my... Hello? So, we just wait here then, right? She said help is on the way. I mean, it's not like the shark's gonna come on land. We just stay away from the water, and we'll be fine. No, I don't know. You saw that shark that got Jenner, it seemed to move just fine on land. If that thing is actually dead, then maybe it doesn't even need to breathe. I mean, it could kill just as easily on land as in water. Amber, it couldn't have been dead. It just must've been stunned or something. No, the hole in the side... and that big... No! It was dead! And it just keeps killing! Okay. So like a zombie shark? What? ( man screams ) What are those people doing in the water? ( man screams ) ( screaming ) Get away! Go, go, go! Woman: Help me! You have any guns in the back? Yes, I have shot guns for skeet shooting! - Get them now. - Okay. Okay, I'm gonna go, and you stay here. - No, I'm going with you. - You don't even know how to shoot a gun. Please, you think you are the only one that dad taught how to use a gun? Locked and loaded, ready to go! Okay. All right. Bridget, let's go. No way. I'm not dying for those people. Damn it, Bridget. Can you think of someone other than yourself for just once? Okay, y'all go. I'll stay here with the CB and try to get in touch with the coast guard. Okay? Hey! Hey! Move! - Help, help! Help us! - Stop, get away! Help! - These bullets aren't doing anything. - Get it away! ( gasping ) What is that? ( grunting ) Get inside! Get inside! Amber! Amber! Amber! Hurry, come on, it's coming! Amber, come on, get out of the water! ( Amber moans ) s more than one now. Thank you. Who are you? Sergeant Maxwell Cage. I'm Amber, this is my sister Sophie. It was you on the radio, right? We need to get you inside, okay? No. Inside? We need to get off this island. We're from the mainland. We need to get back, it took our boat. I understand that, but right now we have to contain the situation. What is the situation? That's classified for now, ma'am. Classified? Those things ate my boyfriend! It was dead, and it just... Wait. Are you from the base? Lester said it was shut down, but is still open? It would have to be. How else did you get here so fast? What's going on? I heard there was chemical warfare testing? Is that what this is? Did you do something to those sharks? Look, I'm not at liberty to discuss anything until we know what's going on. We need to get you inside, okay? No, that's not good enough! Bravo team, this is Alpha 1. What's you status, over? - What is it? - Repeat, Bravo team. Give me a sit rep, over. What's going on? It's another attack. It's my men. I need to get you inside. All right? You need to stay somewhere safe until someone comes to get you. Take us with you. We can help. No, you need to be safe. Just stay there. No, I don't know if you realize, Sergeant Cage, but nowhere on this island is safe as long as they have us trapped. Unless you have more rockets. No, I only expected one of the sharks. Then you're gonna need our help if you want to rescue your men. My vehicle's this way... Wait, what about Bridget? We can count on Bridget to take care of herself. That's what she's best at. Mayday! Mayday! This is Red Plum Island, do you read? Over. Mayday! Mayday! This is an emergency! Do you read? Over. Amber: Stay here! We'll be right back with help! What just happened? Did that dude just have a rocket launcher? Oh, no. Bravo team, this is Alpha 1 come in. Over. Bravo team. Bravo team. This is Alpha 1 come in. Over. Sergeant... They spent every shell. Still didn't stand a chance. Damn it. They are all dead? How is that possible? What happened to them? Over there. Is the blood drawing them in? What's wrong with them, though? They're going nuts. Bruce. Diane: Cage, what's the situation? Cage: The whole team is gone, ma'am. And the shark? He's still here, but we've got worse problems. Subject Bruce has friends. More sharks? Affirmative. And they seem to be infected, too. Oh, my God. How? As far as I can tell, the infected sharks are killing the islanders. The other sharks are swimming in, they're eating what's left. It's like they're being poisoned. They die when they ingest the body parts and then they come back. And Bruce is just watching them. If I didn't know any better, I would think that he's trying to turn them. I think he is trying to make more like him. If they're turning after eating the remains, that must mean that the infection can spread to humans. To what extent, I don't know. How is that possible? I don't know that either. ( sobs ) Ma'am. Please advise. Contain the situation, Sergeant. However you can. In the meantime, I've gotta figure out how to reverse this mess. Acknowledged. Over. ( sighs ) What'd she say? They totally left me here. What the hell? Yeah. That army guy don't need their help. This is so like Amber. So like both of them. They are all goody two-shoes. And wanna save and help everybody. Actually, I think that's a noble characteristic. - Shut up. - OK. So sue me if I don't wanna die. Does that make me a bad person? I mean, it's all meaningless anyway. This world is going to crap. We're all just directionless. Hiding behind social media from each other. Simply just to be reassured that this all means anything. That we even exist. Or anybody even cares. Bridget, I didn't know you felt that way. Yeah, guess I feel a lot of ways. Just nobody can ever see past my boobs. Long enough to listen I guess. Well, I listen. You are a good guy, Lester. Thank you, my mother always said so. I'm still not having sex with you, though. Yeah, thank you. I'm painfully aware of that. Why do those people keep coming to the water? They're setting up a zombie shark buffet. Should, should we warn them? - Bridget: Get out of there! - Lester: Get away from the water. - Get away from the water. - Get out! come on! Bridget! Noooo! As the strom continues to bombard the coastline while we're seeing a rather bizarre report from our affiliate station on Red Plum Island about a series of shark attacks. Corresponding journalist Cat Ward is recovering from her own close call on the island. Captured here. And I warn you, this footage is shocking and may be difficult for some viewers. ( water splashing) Son of a... It's Sophie. Put her on speaker. Sophie, baby! - Sophie: Mom are you there? - Sophie I'm here! Dad's here too. Sophie: Mom, you're breaking up! We saw the news, some kind of shark is attacking? Are you OK, baby? How is your sister? Sophie: Yeah, we're fine. We tried calling Jenner and -- Sophie: Jenner is dead, mom. Hello? Hello, this is Red Plum Island trying to reach the coastguard. Is anyone there? Mom, can you hear me? No, no, we're OK. I'm OK, Mom. Where is Amber? I wanna talk to her right now. Sophie: Ugh, mom, this is not the time to argue. Look, Jenner had the keys to the boat. We're stuck here until we can radio the coastguard. I'm not waiting on them. I'm coming to get you, baby. Sophie: Dad, no, don't, by the time you get here help will have already arrived. You'll just be putting yourself in danger too. - We'll be OK until the coastguard gets here. - Hey, Bill. It's Ross. Sophie, listen, stay inside. Dad will find a way to come and get you. Stay where you are. Sophie: Mom, don't! I don't give a damn how bad the storms are, Bill. My girls are out there! Sophie: Mom, really, we're fine, tell dad to stop. Don't worry about us. Amber is taking good care of me. The storm is too heavy. Ain't nobody getting out there until it lightens up. Amber had no business dragging you off there. With the storm and everything and now this? No, no, no, no, it's not like that. Oh, my parents must be worried sick right now. It took me forever to convince them to let her move to the city. And I promised I would take care of her for them. They're not worried about you too? No. This is my daughter, Marie. She's beautiful. It's the only picture I have of her. She's 10 now. I had her when I was 15. Pretty wild back then. So I gave her up for adoption and haven't seen her since. I'm sorry. It's for the best, you know, and she has a great life, so I hear. The truth is, though, Marie was the absolute last straw with my parents. I was always a disappointment for them. Sophie: What? no, I can't hear you. Sophie though, Sophie, I mean. Straight A's all through high school. And she played basketball and she volunteered at church. Jenner always said that... Do you have any family? Ex-wife, two kids, a boy and a girl. I get to see them a lot more now that I'm a private contractor. It takes a special kind to raise a family in the service. And I was not that special. Barely got through. Sorry. What did mom say? She blames me for this, doesn't she? How bad is it? Dad is trying to charter a boat out here to come get us. But with the storm on the mainland no one would go out. I told them we're OK but you know dad. I can meet you there in 20 minutes. Oh come on, Charlie. I just need to borrow your boat! I'll go by myself, you don't even need to go. Damn it, Charlie! I'm talking about my girls! ( sighs ) I turned off the TV, I couldn't take it anymore. I blamed Amber. What if something happens to Amber. And last thing she thinks is that I blamed her. It was so easy raising Sophie. She was always quiet and reflective. Never got upset about anything. Oh, but Amber, she was defiant. And angry and always had to have the last word. - And she -- - She's just like you. That's why the two of you can never get along. But she knows we love her. Oh, does she? We can tell her next time we see her. - But what if -- - No, Davina. She's strong. She'll be all right. Have faith. I guess that's all we have. Hello. Hello. This is Red Plum Island, can you hear me? Over. Hello, we're trying to reach the coastguard, can you hear me? Over. It's the storm, even if you do get a signal out there, there's no way they're gonna send a boat. We're just gonna have to batten down and ride it out. Lester, are you OK? What did you do to those sharks? I'm not at the liberty to talk about it. No matter how much I want to. You better start talking. Right now. Lester, put the gun down. Not until we get some answers. Look, do you even know how to use that thing? Of course I do. I'm an apex predator. I'm a heartbreaker! I'm a widow-maker! I just, just lost a friend. Listen, man, I'm no scientist. I was just brought on for personal security. I do know the base was closed down a long time ago and recently reopened. A Dr. Diane Palmer was put in charge of a special project that was contracted by the government. A special killer zombie shark project? No, that was an accident. Dr. Palmer was trying to develop a way of regenerating dead tissue. Organs, for soldiers in the battlefield. Sharks were used as test subjects because their basic internal structure is almost identical to human beings. They're good analogs. They picked this island because of the shark traffic. But something went wrong with one of our sharks Bruce. He got out, he killed several of the researchers and he escaped. Bruce, he is the one with the harpoon on his back? The ringleader? Palmer put a beacon out in the water that sent out a pulse that somehow it triggered the electroreceptors in sharks and attracted them. Cage: That's how we brought them in for capture and study. So can we use that to capture it? to kill it? It was damaged in the firefight when Bruce escaped. We have our tech Roger working on in but until he gets it fixed, Bruce is off his leash. And apparently he's making more like him. Although they're not as smart as him it seems. - They're more like. - Zombies. For a lack of a better word, yeah. He is a carrier of some kind of plague. Whatever he bites, it turns. Wait, whatever he bites? Like people too? ( growls ) I said I've had about enough of you! Come on, get out of here! go! Shoo! - Freak. - Who was that guy? Some idiot that I need to get rid of. He always wants something free. Gives me the creeps. No! Sophie: How do we kill it? Clear! What? In all the zombie movies do you have to ask? Palmer's regen agent, it's activated by the nervous system you can cut off a limb, but it still moves. Like the shark we found on the beach. Makes sense to take out the source. Aim for the brain. So what now? We destroy the infected and keep the virus from spreading. That may not be enough, we need to find a cure. Dr. Palmer is our only hope. We need to get back to her right now. But if the islanders are turning into zombies too, how are we gonna do that? We need an army to fight all of them. Leave it to me. You get to the facility, I'll rally the troops, we'll hold the infected off here. Let's go. Yeah, it's me. It's time to awaken the dogs of war. I mean get your weapons and meet me over at the shop, Danny. No, I don't have any gas money! I just gave you money! ( sighs ) Oh, damn. Wasn't supposed to be like this. Roger: Doctor! I think I got the beacon working. That's the first good news I've had all day. With it we can lure Bruce and the other infected sharks back to the facility for containment and immediate extermination. And after we do that, we're gonna start over again, right? I don't know. I don't know if I have the stomach for this anymore. This was supposed about saving lives, not destroying them. I'm just more concerned right now with trying to clean up our mess. My mess. Diane, I need you to listen to me. You cannot give up on this work. We are virtually on the edge of giving the world something truly phenomenal. We are about to cure physical disabilities forever. And if you give up now, you're gonna be giving up on every single person on this Earth. Yes, we've had a pretty significant setback. But we can do this. Roger! ( screaming ) ( gasping ) Lester: OK, here's the score. We have a bit of a zombie shark problem on the island. - What? - Huh? Yeah, zombie shark. They bite you, you turn into a zombie. Let this sink in a minute. Anyway, what we do here on this beach... could shape all human history. This island has been ignored for too long. But we will show the world that we are made of stronger stuff. - Yeah? - Yeah! So get everything ready. Because what we do on this beach today will bridge the gap between all humanity. - Are you ready? - Yeah! OK, here they come. Whatever you do, don't let them bite you. Let them remember the time that they came to Red Plum Island. - Come on! - Yeah! Yeah! Let's get them! ( growling ) Cage: Dr. Palmer, you read me? Over. Sergeant, you're alive! Yeah, for now. We got a development, all the shark's bite victims are turning into zombies. Roger's fixed the beacon, if we can activate it we can bring them all right back to this facility. If we can get them all in one place. Then we can kill them all at once. I've got enough C-4 to do the job. We're coming to you. Wait! Wait, I've been working on a vaccine for the virus, but in order to finalize it. I need to test it on one of the infected. I need an infected brain. Intact. Doctor, I don't think that that's a good idea you haven't seen what this things can do, they don't exactly stay still for you. One of them does. Oh! Come on! come on! I'm ready for you! Come on! We'll have a fish sandwich. Oh! He's strong! Wait, okay, I got him, yeah! Yeah! ( shouting ) Hey! Hey! Watch out, watch out! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Oh, my God he took his arm away! I'm sorry! ( screams ) No, no, no, wait, it was right here. Fan out, we got to find this thing. Amber: Sophie, don't get too far! Relax, warden. Guys, I found it! Amber: Soph, where are you? Sophie: I'm on the other side of the grass. ( grunting ) Okay, get back! Get back! How are we going to carry it to the facility? Get that coat. Ew! Stay back! Okay! We need to get to Palmer. Hold on. What is it? Hold this. Careful. Something's not right. I don't see anything. Things are too quiet. Feels like we're walking into an ambush. What, do you think they're hiding? Are they smart enough for that? I don't know. Bruce could be. They're here! Here! Watch out! Argh! Argh! ( gasps ) - Argh! - Hold on, you'll be OK. ( zombie grunts ) I got it! ( zombie grunts ) Let's go! Get the guns! Let's go! Come on! Sergeant Cage! He was stabbed. Thank God he wasn't bitten! ( Max grunts ) It looks like it missed any major arteries. I can stitch these up for you. Not right now, we don't have the time. Sophie! Can you help me out. Is that-- We got you a gift, doctor. I can't believe you managed to get one. Just tell us it was worth it. That's what were are going to find out. Careful, it bites. Incredible. The regen agent worked. Yeah, really well. You must be Amber Steel. I'm Dr. Diane Palmer from the radio. I... I'm so sorry. For all of this. Well, let's just figure out a way to fix it. Bruce escaped before we had a chance to study his condition. It appears as though once the virus takes hold, the host is reanimated by an electrical response in the nervous system. Like when you take a dead frog and attach it to a battery and it twitches. The dead tissue is rebuilt to some extent. But based on your descriptions, the reanimated have no thought processes besides the simple instincts to move, eat and make more of its own. It's not much different than a regular shark, really. No, Bruce is different. He's smarter than the others. He seems to be planning. Well, he is the alpha. He's the only one that was directly injected. But without him here to study there's really no way to know why Bruce reacted to the regen agent the way he did. Have you found a cure yet? That's what we are about to test. Where's Roger? I've been able to develop a rudimentary vaccine against the initial serum. Once injected into the bloodstream of a healthy subject, it should be able to neutralize the effects of the serum before the infection ever takes root. Though we do have a lot of tests to run. This may be our only opportunity to gather data without running the risk of creating another Bruce. Could you secure the patient? A shark's brain is smaller than a human's. It's much more difficult to find. Got to get in there and penetrate without... damaging it. There! Did it work? No. So, what does that mean? It means that it only works on the living. The infected are already too far gone. But there's got to be a way. What about those people that got bit on the island? You're saying there's no hope for them? I'm sorry. If we had more time, but... No, this much will have to do. Cage: She's right. We've got to stop the virus before it gets off the island. That's our priority. We must stick to the plan. Activate the beacon, bring in the sharks and blow this place to hell and back, ( screaming ) ( screams ) ( whirring ) Here goes nothing. ( sighs ) It's on. Way to go, Roger. ( pants ) Stay down! Look! They're... they're leaving! Hey, they're leaving! ( laughing ) And don't come back! Wait... Where are you all going? Oh, man! They're going to the facility! C-4's been planted. Ready to go. Ahm... Sergeant-- Call me Max. Max. I never got a chance to thank you for everything you've done for Sophie and me. I just... If anything goes wrong, could you just... make sure Sophie gets home okay? You have my word. But I'm not planning on letting anything happen to you either. Sophie: What is that? It's my brother, Ethan. He was a lot like Sergeant Cage. Always the first one into the hot zone. He was very brave. And he loved this country. He died for this country. He died on foreign soil of a wound that was easily treatable. His unit was too far away from the hospital and first aid wasn't adequate. And... He died and there wasn't anything I could do about it. ( sighs ) I decided then that I was never gonna be that helpless again. That's why I developed the regen agent. To give soldiers like Ethan more endurance and better healing capabilities, you know? To give them another chance. But I... never thought this... I can make it right. I will make it right. It's working. They're coming. Oh, they're inside. - Inside? - Yeah. There's a pool down below that has a gate that leads out to the ocean. Yeah, that's how we bring the sharks in. That's how Bruce got out after he killed almost all of my team. Let's go. Come on. Wait! The vaccine's still inside. If this doesn't work that vaccination is the last hope any of us have. I'll be right back. I'm coming with you! Sophie, wait! Get to the shore! Let her go. I don't know if you noticed, but your sister is kind of a badass. Yeah, she is. Okay. Where is it? Got it. ( screams ) Take it! - But... - I'm bit. Just go! Go! I'm sorry. Go! I need to blow it before they get out. Sophie! Sophie, hurry! Do it! Max: Three... two... one! Sophie! Sophie... It wasn't supposed to be you! Amber, it's Bruce. He must... He must have let the others go in first to test it out. I told you he was smart. Amber! Come on! Come on! Amber, stop it! Come on, if you want me, come on! Come on! Come on! Amber, stop! Amber, get out of the way! I got a shot! ( panting ) Amber, move! ( cries ) Max: Watch out! ( screaming ) Amber! Don't miss! ( panting ) Is he dead? He better be. Sophie? Sorry about Sophie. ( moaning ) Sophie? Sophie! Sophie! Give me something to cut her out! ( moaning ) ( Amber grunts ) ( Amber pants ) Sophie! Sophie! ( gasping ) Lester: Sophie? Amber! ( Sophie grunts ) Let's go. ( Amber cries ) What's that? Is the vaccine that's going to save humankind. I need to get it into the right hands as soon as possible. Come on. Let's go. Come on. It's over. The coast guard should be here soon.
