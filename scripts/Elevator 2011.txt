For six years, and its never once got stuck. It's like my worst nightmare. - You must have. Dont ! She just pressed the stop button. It was an accident, Grandpa. It was an accident. Say you're sorry, Madeline. Sorry. - She did it on purpose. She was looking right down and then she pressed it. - You're lying. I saw you. - Liar! Evil little bitch ! I know what I saw. Mr. Axelrod, you're fired. - Fine, I dont give a fuck. Just get me out of here. Let me take the stairs. Jesus, not moving. Maybe you should try not to breathe like that cos you're going to pass out. Sir, you need to pull out the stop button. It's not moving. - Fuck, fuck, fuck I knew it. Please watch your language. There are women and children here. My language? Do you hear he's worried about my language. We're hanging here, squeezed like a fucking sardines language is the problem? I bet language is not the problem, when you blown people up. Did I miss something? - There must be a phone or intercom or..something Let's try going down. Maybe it will reset. That was promising. Who are you texting? - Martha. I'm telling her we're stuck. Which she'll love it. - She's gonna make a documentary about it. Oh, Man. - Hey pal, its ok, this probably just a glitch. How the hell would you know? You said we never get stuck. Technically, we're stopped. - Do you wanna try the intercom there? I mean, I'm sure someone's on duty and get this thing moves. Sometimes this thing just need a little jiggling to free them up. Great, the battery's dead. I'm hungry. - We'll be there soon. I can't breathe. - Look at here. See if this would help? - What is it? Irish whiskey. My husband taught me to be prepared. Hey, I dont really think that's the best idea. - Your idea's suck. Sir, I think we should try the intercom. Alright, we depend on the experts. Security It's a Henry Barton, our elevator seems to be stuck... The 49th floor. - Have you try punching the lobby? It dropped a couple of feet, then stopped again, it wont move at all now. Did anyone push the emergency stop button? Yes, but I pulled it out again, it was an accident. That can't happen. - I've told you. The emergency button is for emergencies only. - Are you listening? Nothing to play with. Just fix it. We're late for our party. - I'll call maintenance. It's exact to be...you've got Wherever you are, it's gonna go off. The mechanism can't be stopped. You sure this is what you wanna do? I hope it won't too much longer. Ever since I've been pregnant... I have to pee every ten minutes. I remember being like that too. My sister's pregnant. She's go bad after raddled. I'm sorry about all this. - Mr. Barton, it's not your fault. Dont know where it'd go. It's my building. - It's your granddaughter. It was an accident. - Liars go straight to hell. That's enough, Mr. Axelrod. - What you're doing? Get fire me again? Go ahead, fire me as many time as you want. Wasn't for her, we won't be here. Is that you? - Excuse me. It's my producer, Martha. If we start to eat each other, she wants it on the 11 O'clock news. I've heard people getting stuck on elevator for days. Feels like we've been here a week already. Hasn't been 10 minutes. Sir, I suggest you stop doing that. It may interfere what maintenance is doing. I hate miss the first course. Thai mussel crab. Suppose to be amazing. Sounds delicious. Now I'm in a hurry. Well, since we all becoming a...elevator family, ehm... Mr. Barton, I have a question. Go ahead. Well, I heard a rumor... Mr. Barton, are you retiring? - I don't believe it. Well, with a 75 million dollars payout... Why would you want to keep working? That's obscene. No, no, it's a...just a figure, the.. paper's cooked up. But just between us, my elevator family, I'm retiring... I'm announcing it tonight. - Why? Maybe the energy the, there are a lot of talented people who can take my place. I'm going to consult, but... want some time to relax with my family. You can afford it. I've worked hard all my life. Who hasnt? I'm starving. Well, if it's alright with your grandfather, you can have this. Thank you. Say thank you, Madeline. It's got nuts. I can't eat nuts. Nuts. Has anyone seen that old film 'Lifeboat' ? Dont they eat someone in that? We're starting people, I've got dim sum and Miss Assana. Watch your line, smart-ass. -Hey I only say what every guy's thinking. Right Mohammed? - It won't get that far. George, can I have the flask? Please, thank you. Oh, thank you Old age ain't for sissies. That's Betty Davis said. You're not old. - No. They say you're as old as you feel. - Are you from New York? Cleveland. - Came all this way for a party? Ah sure, why not? I haven't been to New York since my honeymoon that was 43 years ago. Your husband didn't come with you. My husband's died a few months ago. Oh well, I'm sorry to hear that. He certainly would've wanted to come tonight. Especially to meet you, Mr. Barton. I'm sure he's a wonderful man. - Yes, he was, he's the best. How much longer that we have to stay in here? Not more, not more. My wife. We're stuck in the elevator. - Great, how about Madeline? She's fine, she's fine. - What should I do with everybody? Just start without us. We'll be there soon. - Hurry. All right. I suppose they...have to call the elevator people. Security guard, you wanna get on your walkie talkie maybe get your team to help us? Didnt you hear me earlier my battery's dead. I'm not surprised. - What did you say? I said I'm not surprised. There isn't much more I can do than what Mr. Barton is already doing, ok? - So Don I hear you're getting married. When is the big day? March. I'm a lucky girl. I'm Maureen by the way. I've seen you on TV. I'm Celine. Its really nice to meet you... Don has been keeping you a secret. How do you know Don? Oh, from bonds. I'm on maternity leave right now. But I didnt want to miss this. So you're working in the same department? Yep, yea side by side. Why you didnt say hello? - Hello, Celine. You look lovely tonight. - Thank you very much. We're actually..we dont work together that much anymore. That's enough tho, right Don? Are you okay? - Yea... Okay? Do you have enough room there? Anybody else? - Once you're offering. Oh good yeah, more drinking. Do they forgot about us? Not when you're with the boss. Depends what kind of boss. Let's see if they're making any progress. Security. - This is Henry Barton. We're still stuck in the elevator. Did you find the problem? Looks like the brake's jammed, maintenance contacted the elevator people. How long that's going to take? - Well, they're on their way... But there is a traffic problem. A pile upon the tunnels. It's gonna take a little longer. - Why didnt you call them in the first place? It has to go through maintenance. - Let me speak to someone from maintenance. They are not here at the moment. - Where are they? The elevator technicians are on their way. You need to be patient. What's your name? Hello? Hello ! Hello !! The elevator people are coming. I wanna go home. - Me too. George, since we are a captive audience, why dont you tell us a joke? Yeah, we can use a laugh. I'll tell you one I was working for tonight. - Can not wait. A banker's friend of mine... hired a beautiful blonde, to paint his porch. So after about an hour, he sees she's washing the brushes, and he thinks "That's weird... He'd figured it would take all day. You know, so he could invite her in to... you know ..have lunch. And he looks at her and says "Is everything okay?" And she looks at him with those big, beautiful smile and says,'Oh, yea.' He asks: "Are you done?" and she says... "Yea, it wasn't that big of a job and for your information..." It's not a Porsche, it's a Ferrari. - Thanks a lot, asshole. Don, that's mean. - Joke's got whiskers. I...I found it was funny. Right? Porch, Porsche... - Yea, we got it, we got it. Stupid. Believe it or not, I once opened for Dice Clay. Still stupid. - Yea, you're stupid. Wow hey, how about a little stand up to try sitting down? If you skip the cupcake once in a while, I might have enough room. I hope you suffocate. Where you from, Mohammed? My family comes from Iran. A moslem, I knew it. Knew what? Because I'm moslem I can be avoid in America? You can be, it's possible, but you are suspect. And so because of my family is Indian, Doesn't mean that I've to wear a dot on my forehead? All I'm saying is it can't be ignored. After 5000 years of suffering I have a certain sensitivity. A jew, of course. - Hey man... We know about your nuclear ambitions, and we have you in the cross hair. You're imbecile. - I gotta go. I'll follow you out. - No, I really have to go, I have to pee. I, I can't hold it any longer. I thought I've been here in the restroom by now. What you wanna do? It's not that nice of a bag really. What does your bag have to do? Do you mind if I'll just squeezing into this corner right here? Where you really go. Thank you. Ok. Thanks. Thank you. - Here you go. This is good, ehm... Can I just, do me a favor, just hold your arm? just to keep me up for a second? You know, I'll just do it myself I dont wanna be doing here. I promise. How about...how about this? Thanks, Martin. - No problem. Hey, no problem. Thank you. What she's doing? She can't do that in here, make her stop Grandpa. Don't look. - There it is. Never do when people watching. Ew, I can hear it. Well, its better than pee on the floor, isn't it? Now they're not answer them. I can smell it. - Be quiet. I can't. Okay, we're good. -Yeah? We're good. Oh good, I never care much for my dignity anyway. No, it's fine, it's fine... I am so.. sorry about that everybody. - No, it's fine, it's fine... I really feel much... much better now. Our son Geoff died in Iraq. Could someone help me up, please? Thank you. Our son Geoff died in Iraq. They practically killed my husband, Neill,... He and Geoff very close, and... He... It basically took his spirit... We were going to buy a boat, when he retired. He was always studying these boat magazines. That's what cut him through, really. Didn't he get one? Barton Investments lost all of our money. Redding, your husband Neill Redding? - Yes. Called me up 6 months ago, he wanted his money back. and he screamed at me and said I've ruined his life. Part those endeavor junk bonds from us. Not we advice to our clients to bought, No one could see what was around the corner. It's just one of those things. My husband shot himself in the head. After my child, my son, he was my whole life. Really sorry, I mean no matter how much that we know it's still just a gamble... You can't blame me or...us. He trusted you. He trusted you, to do the right thing. He trusted you... Don't mean to sound careless, but it's always the investor's decision. And then I heard that you got the 75 million dollars payout ! Sleazy bastards. It wasn't fair. Life isn't fair. No,it isn't. Life is shit. So why are you here, Mrs. Redding? If it were me, this is the last place that I would wanna be. I hope this is okay. I give it back if you changed your mind. I started the timer. Thank you. I'm....running out of time. I just wanted to deliver a message. I didn't know that the elevator was going to be stuck. What was the message? - That's a... Jane, what's wrong? She needs help. Jane? Jane, breathe. What's wrong? - I think a heart attack. She needs help. - I'll call 911. Jane? Help her ! Help her ! 911, What can I help you ? She...she can't breathe. I don't wanna die in an elevator. - Oh, you're not gonna die. You're not gonna die. - Believe she's having a heart attack. Ok, what is your location? - I have a bomb. Did she just say she has a bomb? -Excuse me? She said she has a bomb. Who has a bomb? - The woman. I don't think she's breathing. She's gone. - You know maybe she has stroke? I was medic in the army. She's dead. You tell them we need to get out of here right now. They need to fix this right now. Tell them. Cos we have a medic, that's how we know. Hello? Answer me... - Redding... Jane Redding. We need help! They're sending emergency services. God damn it, where are these people. Now they're not answering. This is unacceptable, they have a job to do. - You pissed them off, Henry. We didnt lose their money, they've lost their own money. We're not responsible for client's decision. We facilitate it. You got blood on your hand man, -Shut up.. throw me off the elevator. This is ridiculous. Where this 70 years old woman gonna get a bomb. Her son died in Iraq... - 70, maybe 70. Help me through it. - I don't know. Tell me what you see. What she told us we just met her. She only said that... - How do you know she has a bomb? That what she said. Jane Redding from Cleveland, just before she died. Have you called 911? - We're talking to 911 now. What different does that make? 70, maybe 70. -This is big, can you stream on your phone? I'm fine. I can do it, I'll start streaming. -Well it's not obvious, a... I dont...if... She has a purse. Why dont we check for bomb? Its not to overreact. We need to keep our wits. Get the fuck here and do something. There's 9 of us including CEO Henry Barton and his granddaughter. Really, with the camera? - Minutes ago, Jane Redding... An investor at Barton, died of a heart attack. She told us she has a bomb. There is no bomb. She was upset, because an investment went wrong. You see this sort of thing on the news. -How Barton checks... Because she's the one who after him anyway. You are a security guard, it's your job. I'm not trained for bombs. There's experts for that. You're the fucking expert, so do it. I'll check it. Celine Fouquet, bond trader, an expected mother... has volunteered to check Redding for any explosive device. Am I just open it up, or... - Yea. It can't be so sensitive right? I mean she's been carrying it around all night. Damn it God, dammit. Looks like there's a wallet in here. How do you know it's just a wallet? Maybe it does look like a wallet.. In case my camera didn't pick that up, there's a huge sigh of relief. There's no bomb? - No bomb, sweety. Mrs. Redding just had a few problems, that's all. Her husband just blew his brains out. - Why do you insist on being so obnoxious? My granddaughter's 10 years old. Do you think she needs to hear that? No any of us knows what happened to Mr. Redding. She could've made it all up. For all we know he could be sitting in Queens and drinking a beer and watching TV. Sounds good to me. So we get this thing move, I'm starving... They lose their money and homes and what do they do? Oh, for God's sake. It's a good job Celine. What is that? Neill Redding, tragic victim of the collapsed economy. It says here that he shot himself. So she wasn't making that up. Happy now? It doesn't mean anything. Miss Fouquet checked her purse. Wait, no, if that's true, then... I think we..we should check under... Under her dress, under her blouse, Isn't that what they do? How do I know what 'they' do. I'm not a suicide bomber ok? I don't know any suicide bombers. I never touch or even seen a real bomb in my life. I'm an American, just like you. Feel better now? I asked, because you're in the army. I am not taking her clothes off. Okay, then just like a feel around, like the police do. I dont have any experience with what the police do, Martin. We've learned a lot about you, Martin. No, look, just run your hands over her body. We gotta to find out. Jesus Christ. When did I starting grow balls ? I don't know, there's something there. - Are you joking'? I'm not joking. There's definitely something there. Look could be any.. - Or a bomb. Stop saying that. - Fire me. We got to find out. You are a very impressive woman, Miss Fouquet. Stupid. There is a bomb. It's nice knowing you all. - She's got a bomb? We do not know what it is, sweety. - It's not a satellite radio. It's a metal box, the size of a bar of soap... It's attached to what looks like a bicycle cables. Martha, I'm gonna save my battery power Just get them to hurry, we need help. Come help me. I'll climb up here, there's gonna be a hatch. And then what? There's nobody goes. It's for fuck's sake, help me. - This is desperate. We are trapped here on with a bomb, all right Mr. Barton? A bomb. It's all desperate. Come on. Do it. I can't see anything. Hold me . - Yea. It's just fucking lights. The only elevator without an escape hatch in this city? And then now what? Anyone have a deck of cards? Nothing. Wouldnt do me much good anyway. Where we are here? You shouldn't smoke. The fuck do you care? What now, you gonna become a concerned father? That's not what I meant. There's just 9 of us... You shouldn't smoke. That just... Its all we're breathing this air. What do you say? What she's talking about? - You can tell it better. It's not the time, all right? I'll explain it later. Perfect time to confess. - Shut the fuck up. Who? me? - It's not the time all right? I wanna know now. - I'll explain it later, ok? Man up Donnie, like when you put me on your desk, remember that? I'm so sorry. It was a mistake, alright, We just spent so much time together. You weren't home. It just happened, I'm really sorry. Is she carrying your child, Don? Yeah, it's possible. I don't wanna die. You're not gonna die, sweety. No one's gonna die. They're sending someone to get us out. - Is that another guarantee, Henry? You are such an asshole. - Yeah takes one with no one You seems like you're enjoying all this. - I'm a happy pessimist. I'd expect the worst and I'm never disappointed. How do we know it's not a fake? Maybe she did it just to scare us. Why'd hide a fake bomb? The whole reason have a fake bomb is to show it off Maybe she's gonna show it at the party later, Wouldn't that make more sense? Can't be that easy to get explosive material you can't just walk into Wall-Mart and pick it up. - Yes, it can be bought. Oh...there, you heard it from the expert. - Motherfucker ! Stop it. Just get back! Fuck you! - Hello. No, it's okay. It's just speculation. No, honey,no I know. She's alright, she's just..afraid. Want talk to grandma? Here. Hi Grandma. - Don't worry sweety. I know. I'm scared. - Everything's gonna be fine. I love you. - I love you too. No, they'd be here any seconds. I promise. I love you. Everything's going to be fine....ok We interrupt this program with a special news. Tonight, at the Barton building... 9 people, including CEO Henry Barton and his granddaughter... are trapped in a stuck elevator, with what appears to be a bomb. Our Maureen Assana is 1 of the 9 people who trapped. This is Maureen Assana for WRPGTB in New York. I'm streaming from an elevator at the Barton building. A few minutes ago, Jane Redding, an investor with Barton... died of an apparent heart attack. - No bomb. She was upset, because an investment went wrong. You see this... We have no knowledge about how much time we have left. We need you to understand the gravity of the situation. The woman's dead. Barton should check. she's the one who after him anyway. Fuck this, alright let's get the goddamn doors open alright. Come on. - Don, what are you doing? Only one way out alright? You have no choice. Let's get these doors open, come on ! Pull.... Shit, we can't get through of it. - Somebody help us! They evacuated the building They had to. What if we open it up and throw the bomb out? - How? How you gonna get it off her? I don't know alright, What if I climb up and I hit the bomb on the outside. I mean, it's a different controller, maybe its get stuck and it's not moving They're all in the same circuit. How do you know, are you fucking elevator expert? - I know how things work. Ok smart ass, give me your big idea, alright? Cos I'm not gonna sit around here and get fucking blown up Sweety, you have to be brave, ok? Don't cry. Try not to cry, ok? Try to be brave. I think we should do it. What we got to lose? You guys love pushing buttons. You know, it's tighting the world works. - Better than doing nothing. Been on the phone with these people, ok? Who knows when they're getting here? We are on our own. They have to come and the Bartons is a big fucking deal right? Off course is gonna be on TV, isn't it? Yes, it is probably already on CNN now. It's headline news. You heard her. She said we're home tonight, ok? That means 2 things... That means that the bomb probably on a timer... And that means we can not wait ! You guys help me get the door open alright? Will you guys help me up there? - Yes Come on, come on ! Pull! Pull! Mohammed, you push me up? - Yea...oh, shit! What are the buttons? Here we go. I think I need someone to help me with the buttons.

Sit down next to her. I got you. Sit down, sit down. It's all my fault. - Watch your head. It's all my fault... It's kinda a roller coaster, right? I dont like roller coasters either. It'll be okay. I saw you pushed the button, sweety...by the way... It must runs in the family. It'll be okay. - Should I call 911? Yeah, call 911. - We gotta get outta here. 911, what is your emergency? We're still waiting. Yes, sir, can you please explain... Will you come help us? - What is your location? Stuck in the fucking elevator. - Where are you? We need help, we need help now.

My friend is bleeding out. Now where are you? Hold this one on tight. I'm not a prayer. - You should be. If you pray every day, what good done to you? If God knows everything, he knows I try to do the right thing, I dont have to kiss His ass Yep we need help, we need help, now. Could be worse. - How? Have you played the Colony, Celine? - Are you retarded? Cos I ain't think this is a joke! Look around, do you think this is funny? There's a bomb in here that might kill us any seconds... And end my baby's life. I don't know what you think its so fucking funny, we're not your audience. Hey, this is what I do. Some people cry, some people can angry, I tell jokes. I talk too much. And to be honest, yes, I'm annoyed myself. But does it make any different to the bomb? No! I apologize for not the guy you want me to get stuck with. I dont want this gig anyway, I was a last minute substitution. Do you know the story about of people lost get on the plane that crashed? I'm the guy that takes their place. There...If the bomb goes off now, I'm happy with those being my last words. "'Porch, Porsche." I gotta remember that. As Don says it does has whiskers. No. Guys, it's the bomb-maker. What's the reason you decided to come forward? I thought Mrs. Redding was dead. This is what she wanted. She wasn't a terrorist. She was a good person. Maybe there's still time to help these people. Why did you do something like this? Why did you make her a bomb? I was friend with her son, Geoff in Iraq. We're like brothers, I owed them. And his mother asked me for help. Can you tell us more about the bomb? It was much explosives... And anybody in the elevator would be surged. You mean deadly? - Yes, sir. It would be damaged. - How long do these people have? It's time to get out of there. I guess it's within 10 minutes more less... - Maureen! Martha? Slow down, I'll just put you on speaker. They've evacuated the building and the process is not complete. The bomb squad and the FBI search the entire building. And the cops are all over the world. We have 10 minutes... Who's that? It's Celine. We just saw interview with the bomb-maker. He says we have 10 minutes. They know that. Do they hear the part about 'more or less'? Who is that? - Who cares the fuck? I think that's gonna stands their way the TV ratings. That's ridiculous! It has to be bad. Really? 8 people stuck in the box, waiting to die? And what's that? We need to get outta here. I'm sorry sweety, I know it must be awful, but they're doing everything they can. Hold on. Yeah, should go with the money, cos money, money buys salvation. Martha, I need you to help us. Keep streaming... She asked us how much battery we have left. Looks like we must do everything what we can. We have to be. Alright, I know things don't look great right now, but there's a bit of good luck. - Please George... I was thinking the elevator dropped, right? So elevator dropped, how do we know the doors have been line-up now? We go look out. - Ok, I take this side. Let's do it. If we can get out, we'll push Madeline out first. Get ready, Madeline. It's all my fault. - She's ready. We have to do it the same time. - Get ready. - Now. Mohammed... I can't get any traction cos of my leg, a bit sting here. There isn't coming, is it? Shit.. We did get it open before. We had Don... And we're dealing with Muhammed's restless leg syndrome. And how the fuck do you think I got this? well you fucking moron ! I barely touched you... - Henry... We need your help. Come on. Henry, you're gonna do this for Madeline, alright? ok. Needs to pull really hard that way. Here we go... And...Pull! Pull harder. Come on. Shit. We still have a few minutes. - More less... So that's it. This is...this is wanna where we all...died. It happens. This is where it's gonna happen for us. It's all because...this... This fucking pathetic... woman who can't take responsibility for her actions. And because of you. You dont...you dont give a fuck, do you? You knew those bonds were crap. Everybody did. Don memo-ed to me 8 months ago. We all knew. But you, you forced us to push among these people. Barton, you hear me in there? We need to open the doors 1 more time. Well, it's a brick wall, we can't get out. I just need to see something first. - Get it yourself. It may not be a big deal, but I just need to open the doors 1 more time, ok? ok? Ok, everybody everybody, come on, 1 more time. Henry, I need you. Again? - Yes, 1 more time, come on! Pull ! I need something sharp. Who's got anything sharp? Something sharp. This? This is it? - That's all I've got. No one has anything else? What do you expect George? We're going to a cocktail party. George, what are you thinking? - It was Don's idea, really. But there's room enough to drop the bomb down the elevator. How? - You can cut through metal cable with that. I know. - Well then, how? You can't be serious. - I told you it was a last resort. Can do what? - She's not gonna get any dead-er. It's all I got. We have to cut the body in half. How much time do we have? How much time do we have? - It's about 3 minutes. They are on their way, they're gonna be here any seconds. Hold on, hold on, we can't count on that. Ok listen, George is right. It's not like she's gonna another different. - Is that against the law? Fuck the law! This is our lives we're talking about, ok? She got us in this situation in the first place. - She's still a human being...ok? She was a human being, now she's a corpse. Who's gonna do it? I've done my fair share volunteering, George. This is your idea. I'm not touching this. I'll help. I can't do it, but I'll roll back whoever push. Ok, okay, I'll do it. I mean how, how much worse can it get. Look we just clear the bomb off of her, drop down the shaft and then we're good. We're good. Ok, well, I'll do it. I'll do it, but we're all doing it together. We're all in this together, its like we're all holding a knife...ok? Okay? Mohammed? Alright, alright. Ok... Do I start the front or cut through the back bone or what? Under the ribs. Shit Muhammed, you're the medic. - I don't know. Stomach is softer. - Just, just do something, just start. I bet she should not to be held down right? - I don't think so. Ok, so... So, just anywhere, right? - Oh fuck, come on, for fuck's sake we're running out of time George. If we get out of here alive, would you have sex with me? No. Ok, I like that answer, because it means you have hope. If you'd said yes, that's mean you've thought there is no hope. Cut her! Ok, Ok. Here it goes. I can't do it. Come on, George. - I can't, I'm sorry. George, you promised, you promised you would, come on George. - Can't, sorry. George, you have to do it. - No, I don't have to do shit. George, come on. I'll do it. I'll cut the bitch. Get there, boy. Where's the knife? - Here we go. When I was in high school... I've spent the summers working in a butcher shop. Whose knife is this? Come on. What did you do with it? Car...brakes? I use it to clean my nails. Come on. She is tough! How much time do we have? - Less than one. Somebody get the guts, I can't see what I'm doing. Huh me? Ok, I'll do it. I'll fucking do it. No merit badge just for this. I'm gonna be sick. Now we're fortunate she didn't eat first. I'm gonna be sick. - Oh, God. There is always a bright side. I can't get to this spine with this thing. Be quicker if we break it. How? How we're gonna do that? Someone takes one hand and someone takes the other... We'll just twist it. How? We've come this far, we are gonna finish. If we get out of here, I want you to give each of us a million dollars. This is bullshit. And a million for her baby too. It's the least you can do. Alright, If we get out. Deal? - Deal. Here, you take this end The rest of you, take her feet. We've come this far. - On a count to three. Go twist to the left, you twist to the right. One, two, three... You both have to go to the right. Alright, ready? - One, two, three. Ow, she's getting stiff! One, two, three. This is Lieutenant Carson with the bomb squad. We are gonna get you out of there. We outta time! We have men in shaft that trying to unlock the brake, We want to lower you to the next floor. Make it quick! That's gotta be a good sign. Mohammed... Ok, He's barely alive. We gotta get him out of here, come on! Get us out of here. Is the bomb go off? - No, not yet. Someone needs help. Bring him to me! Come on, first the girl, and then who's next? Pull! You're next. We wont hurt you. One, two, three. How we get him out of here? He's too big, He can't fit. I'm not fit through here... We get him out through the basement. How's he gonna get out? We lower down and we'll take him out through the basement. You can't leave him in there. You've gotta lower me down. Get the door shut now. Stop. I guess... I'm the hero. Because I need to talk with you. I don't care how late it is. I have to tell you something. Hello....Hello....? Hey let me ask you something, Do you think Iran has nuclear weapon? I'm just asking...
