Continuing with a lateral incision across the myocardium... ...we expose the chordinae tendinae. As you can see, premature ventricular contraction has set in. And is followed by full cardiac arrest. Respiration has bottomed out. All brain function has ceased. The patient... ...has expired. You win some, you lose some. And now, ladies and gentlemen... ...you are about to experience... ...the cutting edge of medicine. Let's open this baby up and see what it'll do. What is it, doc? It's patient 193. - Shit, that's Dr. Giggles. - Who? It's his nickname. Nobody knows his real ID. Delusional, acute schizophrenic with an IQ somewhere in the stratosphere. We're talking prodigy. He thinks he's a... doctor. Jesus, what the hell... Mm, Dr. Philips. Dr. Philips, this isn't really the place. He should have kept his hands to himself. What the...? The patients. He's released the patients. Laughter is the best medicine. Mmm. Ha-ha-ha. - Aah! - Check-out time. Hey, Jen. - Ask me why summer's off to a great start. - Why is summer off to a great start? I called Johnson at lunch. I got a job. Playing old favorites for the locals at his restaurant every Wednesday. That's great, Max. I don't know, my math's pretty shitty... ...but I think that leaves us six nights of the week to engage in unsafe practices. Heh. You wish. Why do I detect a disturbing lack of jubilation here? I mean, maybe you haven't heard, but school's out, you know? The central government's collapsed. People are free. L... I just didn't get much sleep last night, that's all. Maybe it's time for the famous Max Anderson stress test. I hope you two can breathe through your ears. Yeah, as long as you don't plug them off. First time I've ever been accused of talking too much. - You guys know where to meet tonight? - Eight o'clock, Breeder's Hill. A fitting name, don't you think? You know, we might be a little bit on the tardy side. Heh. Yeah, we're going on a little expedition. Expedition? You guys bringing tents? - No, these guys have a big surprise planned. - Right. Speaking of big surprises, the twin peaks. Let's climb. See you guys later. Party down tonight. Hi, guys. I better get going. I gotta stop by Johnson's and fill out some stuff. - Okay. - You sure nothing's wrong? Yeah. Pick me up at quarter to eight? Quarter to eight. Look up for me. Now, I want you to sit up straight. How's your dad doing? Give me a deep breath. All right. Again. Hmm. When will you know if you need to you know... Replace the valve? Well, it's way too early to tell. We'll have to wait and see what we get on the monitor... ...when you come back next week. - Next week? Jennifer, don't forget that a mitral valve prolapse... ...is not that serious. Even if we have to operate, we do them all the time. I'll try to remember that. It's more important that you remember to avoid strenuous activity. No coffee, no tea and especially no alcohol. It's all in here. Anne will show you how to put the monitor on. I'll see you next week. Erica, what in the world's the matter with you? - Oh. It's okay, Ms. Henderson. - Hey, that's an odd-looking radio. - It's... It's not really a radio. - It isn't? Well, what is it then? I'm kind of in a hurry. Can I talk to you later? Okay? Hmm. Hi, Jennifer. Hi, Billy. Jen, honey, is that you? Hi, Daddy. Hey. Hi, sport. Come on in. I'm sorry I couldn't get to the doctor. If I don't upload these figures by 6:00... ...I'm gonna be selling door-to-door. So, what did Chamberlain say? Same thing he said last week, wait and see. Got a new fashion accessory. Whoa. Yes, well, that's a good color for you. - Thanks. - Hey, at least school's out. It might as well be fall. I can't do anything. Yeah, I know. But you have to take it easy or you're not gonna get any better. I thought dinner was almost ready. You know what they say, an apple a day keeps the doctor away. I know you're worried. Especially with what happened to your mother. It's not that, Daddy. It's... It's her. Tamara? Oh. I think you're gonna get to like her. I think it's gonna take some time. He's in the den. Daddy, Daddy. I wanna be a doctor just like you. You will someday. I promise. Yes, yes, I know. First thing's first. This town murdered you. It's sick... ...and must be cured. This is the surprise? Shut up. When are we opening the case? Beer, right? Whoo-hoo! All right. Town's got a doctor And his name is Rendell. Stay away from his house Because he's the doctor from hell. He chopped up his patients, Every last one And he cut up their hearts Purely for fun. So just what is this big mystery? This big mystery? Remember the facts of the case. The citizens of Moorehigh surrounded the house, broke in... ...and they dragged the town doctor into the streets. - And they stoned him to death, right? - That's right. And then they came in after his son, but he disappeared. - Never found him. - How did Evan get out of the house? The suspense is killing me. Well, some say Dr. Rendell cremated him. - Some say he ate him. - Oh, sick. But I think Evan never left the house. I think he's still here. Alive. That way. What is this? Shit. I don't believe this. This is where we start. Stu, what are you doing? He's in the walls. - He's in the what? Secret passageways. Come on, guys. That's how he's managed to stay hidden for so long. Duh. Don't just stand there, start banging. I'm not doing this. So, what exactly are we listening for? A hollow sound. - Through your head. A hollow sound... Where are you going? Hey. How long are we gonna keep banging on the walls before we give up this shit? Stu. What are you doing? Let us out. Stu, let me out. Are you sure they're gonna be all right? Sure, as long as they don't wake up Evan. All they gotta worry about is what to do with each other. Oh, fuck. Uhn! Fucking door. Oh, I think it's dislocated. Oh, this is just great. Real mature. This was your idea, wasn't it? - My idea? - Yeah, your idea. You made up this whole bogus expedition just to get us alone in the dark, right? You aren't getting any, so you're wasting your time. - That offends me. - Oh, yeah? Then get me out of here. Trotter, I'm telling you just get me out of here and... Just get me out of here... ...and maybe you will get something. Whew. Get ready to take your medicine, Moorehigh. The doctor is in. That butt head. [FOOTSTEPS What's he doing? He's just trying to make us nervous. He's doing a good job of it. Stu. Stu, this is stupid. I don't like this. Come on. Don't you notice a classic Stuism when you hear one? That does not sound like Stu. Come on, who else could it be? Stu. Stu. - Aah! - Trotter, what's wrong? What's wrong? What happened? Let me see. That is not funny, you asshole. That's not funny. Get me out of here. I was just joking. You're so full of shit. Trotter. Trotter get up. I'm not really seeing patients yet... ...but I guess I can make an exception. Hello? Anyone in here? Is anybody in there? Well, I'm gonna call the police. Hmm. I know. Way to chug, babe. I remember riding the Ferris wheel when I was a little kid. We'd stop at the top and I could see all the big kids... ...parked on the hill where we are now. I wanted to be with the big kids so bad. Yeah, well, now you are with the big kids. You know, Max, I'm really not that thirsty. Hey, what's thirst got to do with it? I just don't wanna drink right now, okay? Come on, why do we have to get drunk to have fun? We don't have to get drunk, but it's a damn good start. Well, not for me. Hey. Trouble in paradise? Shit. Hey, the party's moving to the bash. It's every man for himself. Most of you are probably too wet behind the ears... ...to remember this old chartbuster. Judy Holliday made it famous way back in 1960... ...when I would have been just old enough to join you. And it's called... ..."The Party's Over". That's right, the party's over. Good night, officer. Asshole. Now, Officer Magruder is gonna wind up. Anyone still on the premises... ...will be partying in beautiful, recently repainted Moorehigh lockup. Whoo-hoo! You mind if I turn this noise off now? You live for that shit. Ooh. Magruder's raid on Breeder's Hill... ...that's a Moorehigh tradition, son. You got any other traditions I should know about? Unit 3, possible 3- 11 at 5714 Tivoli Court. Please respond, code two. You're asking about Moorehigh traditions? Ten-to-one Elaine Henderson called that in. That crazy broad sees rapists in her hemorrhoid cream. Erica, when are you gonna figure out how to use the doggy door? Come on, come on. And stop barking. You're gonna lose your voice again. Get in bed, Erica. The cops never come when you want them. Operator, I need a doctor. It's a good thing I make house calls. These things happen when you neglect your regular checkups. Now... ...open wide and say, "Ah. " Uh. Uh. Uh. No, "Ah. " Ah! Mm-hm. Let's have a look at that nose. A good physician... ...always has the right instrument for the job. Now, now. This won't hurt a bit. Hmm. I think I found the problem. So this is her. Some of the guys back at the station warned me about this place. Yeah? What did they say? They didn't get into much detail. Surprise is the kind of detail most people around here rather forget. Well, I've always had a way of figuring things out by what people don't say. I think that's called... ...reading between the lines. - Mm-hm. So this guy was a doctor? Yeah, Evan Rendell. He was the town doctor. He offed seven of his patients. Cut out their hearts while they were still alive. Shit. What would make a guy crack like that? His wife took sick. Heart problems. He was trying to save her. Somewhere along the line old doc just suddenly threw a piston. The sicker she got, the crazier he got. One day, folks just started disappearing. Seems he was trying to find his wife a new ticker. Well, who knows, if they hadn't killed him... ...maybe he'd have pulled off the world's first heart transplant. Ahead of his time, but out of his mind. It's ugly business clearing all that up. Reitz. It's nothing. Didn't he have a son? Wasn't his kid involved in helping the father out or something? That's what they say. There was this big mystery. How did the kid get out of the house? That's what they say. What do you say? I don't say. Mm-mm. I'm not going up that staircase, not until I drop another 30 pounds... ...and that ain't gonna be for a long time. Do you smell that? What? Smells like rubbing alcohol. No, I don't smell nothing. Come on, I gotta make a pit stop. Hey. Hey, come on, let's go. How serious is it? Well, the doctor says it isn't very serious at all. But depending on what this piece of junk says... ...they might have to operate to fix the valve. Operate? Yeah. They're telling me it's a routine operation. Why didn't you tell me about this before? I didn't want you to feel sorry for me. Shit, Jen, you know, I'm your boyfriend. We're supposed to face things like this together. Remember, you and me? I love you. There's something else. It's about my mom. I never told you the way she died. She went into the hospital for a routine operation. I never saw her again. Jen, I'm sorry. I had nightmares for the longest time... ...and after a while, they went away. But now they're back. Okay, folks, exit to the right. Watch your step. Listen to me, some hero, huh? My mom died and all I talk about is stupid nightmares. I don't give a shit about anyone but myself. That's not true. My dad's trying to get on with his life and all I do is bitch and moan. I'm sorry, Max. I gotta be alone tonight. Oh, yeah. Don't stop. Oh, baby. You are king. You are king. Sorry, guys. Guess I'm destined to screw up everyone's night. Hey, wait up. Swiped it from my mom's suitcase before she and Dad left for vacation. You expect me to wear this? Look, right now, my mom's probably pretty pissed off, not to mention my dad. Don't let their pain be in vain. Okay. But if I'm dressing up... :::so are you: - Where did you get this? - They pass them out in gym class. I must have skipped. Guess I'll go and powder up. Shit. Ready. I'm coming, I'm coming. Could it possibly be any colder in here? Sixty-five? These people are Eskimos. Shh-shh-shh. You'll catch your death of cold running around like this. I think we should take your temperature. Now, don't make a sound. There's a good girl. Tongue up. Lucky for you, I've discovered the only known cure for the common cold. Leave it in for at least a minute. Maybe she won't notice. Ready or not, here I come. You know... ...ever since I found my mom's Victoria's Secrets catalogue... ...I have been dying for this. I hope you have protection. Hmm. Hmm. Terminal. - Oh, Jennifer's home. - No. No, I just wanna see if she's okay. She's never okay. Come on, she needs time to adjust. I mean, the girl is sick. She just lost her mother, for God's sake. You just lost your wife, you've adjusted. I'll be right back. Hey, Jen. What the... Jennifer? - What's the matter? - Oh. Sorry. Jennifer was here. We have to go look for her. Look for her where? I don't know. The fair. Something is wrong. I found her heart monitor, she'd been drinking. - Right where she wanted you to find it. - What are you talking about? She's trying to tear us apart. Don't you see that? All I can see is that my daughter is sick and that she might be in trouble. So are you coming or not? No. I'm not. If Jennifer comes back, you tell her to stay here. Unbelievable. Hey, Max. Where's Jennifer? I don't know, we got separated. So you hear about that top secret bash going on over in the main building? We were just gonna crash it. Do you wanna come? Sure. Why the hell not? Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. All that fat. All that sugar. We've got to start taking better care of ourselves. Remember, we are what we eat. But not to worry. We'll get it out of your system. They have a saying. What goes down... ...must come up. I know, I know. It sucks. First of all, you gotta use the right fingerings. There. Okay, now, you just gotta... ...blow the thing right there. - You just can't blow it like that. - Why not? Oh, you gotta use the right embouchure. What's that? It's the way you place your, uh, lips. I've never had a problem with my lips before. Maybe you better show me what I'm doing wrong. Heart problems. Heart. It's your heart. Just a broken heart. Ooh. Just like mother. No. Moorehigh can wait. I wanna make you proud. I want to carry on your work. Looking for someone? Yeah, Max. I think I can help you. I guess I should thank you, Max. Jen? Fuck. At least now I know which one of us is really sick. Jen. Jen. Jen. Jennifer come out, I saw you come in here. Just let me talk to you. Leave me alone. Jennifer. You broke my heart, Max. And some things just can't be fixed. Jennifer, wait. Max. Oh! Shit. Oh. This is just choice. Now I'm bleeding. Have an accident? Probably just needs a Band-Aid. Max? Max? Max, if you're screwing around, this is a really stupid time. Max? Don't worry. - It's ouchless. - Ah! Trust me. I'm a doctor. - Whoa! - What happened? What's the matter? - It's Coreen. - What? Jennifer, get out! Run! Are you feeling any discomfort? No! Ohh. Help! Ms. Henderson, help me. What in the hell are you doing? - He's trying to kill me. - Who? A doctor. I'm telling you, there was someone after her. I know, I know, a doctor. There's one doctor in this town and I've known since he was your age. He looked like a doctor, I don't know what he was. Maybe he just thinks he's a doctor. Maybe he wanted to be a doctor and never got the chance. How's that? I know this is gonna sound crazy... ...but has anyone here considered this guy might be Dr. Rendell's son? Not anyone who is serious about keeping his job. Why don't you go back and take 10. I'll call you when your parents get here. Come on, buddy. - Promise me you'll look after her. I don't have to promise you doodly squat. Have we heard from the fair? Bill found the broken glass, no dead girl. I don't doubt it, chief. Did you get a whiff for those kids? - They were having too much fun. - You saying they both imagined it? I finished checking on her. - How is she? She's stable, but I wanna take her to the office, put her on the EKG. Sure thing. Oh, and if you see any of your fellow marauding doctors out there... ...you'll let us know. Why the EKG? She has a heart condition. Could become serious. Dr. Rendell's wife died of a heart problem. So did my mama, daddy and grandpa. How did we get back into Dr. Rendell? Hold it in, chief. My new partner here just got a little bump on the head. That has nothing to do with it and you know it. - Nor does Dr. Rendell. That's enough. - Look... - I said that's enough... ...or you'll be handing out parking tickets. Listen, these kids are pulling your chain. Relax. Oh, why don't you go and see if you can catch the girl's father. I'll leave a message in case he beats you there. - Sure thing, chief. - Reitz, station duty. And next time, wear your seatbelt a little tighter. Magruder. Magruder. You smelled something in the Rendell house, didn't you? I didn't smell nothing. - You saw that girl. She was fucking scared to death. That little girl probably just had too much to drink. It happens to the best of us. And what about the boy, huh? Did he have too much to drink? - Let go of me. - Not until you level with me. I'm going to level you if you don't let go. Do what you feel, but it might be easier to just tell me what you're hiding. Is it Rendell's son? I'm sorry. I haven't opened this bottle for 35 years. I haven't had a drink in all that time either. How come? I'm your partner, man. Tell me. It was 1957. The night after they found all the bodies. All the other officers were gone. The mob had already offed Dr. Rendell... ...but the search was still on for Evan Jr. We'd moved all of Rendell victims out of the house... ...and I was left alone to watch over the bodies. I don't need to tell you, I was plenty spooked. Thank God for Mr. Moon Glo. It was around midnight when I heard it. Who is in here? And I watched him come out. It was like he was being born again. That was how Dr. Rendell got his son out of the house. He'd sewn him up in what was left of his wife's corpse. Ahh. And when I came to, little Evan was gone. Everything's clean. It was like it never happened. Evan's mom was even sewed back up. Jesus, this is a major league fucked-up town. Why haven't you told anyone? Who'd believe a 20-year-old kid under too much pressure... ...and too much Moon Glo? Our town has a doctor And his name is Rendell. Stay away from his house, He's a doctor from hell. Chopped up his patients, Every last one. And cut out their hearts Purely for fun. So if you're from Moorehigh And you should get sick. Then fall on your knees And pray you die quick. Don't go chasing nursery rhymes, Reitz. Hi, you've reached the Campbell residence. - Neither I... - Or Jennifer. Can come to the phone right now. Please leave a message and we'll call you right back. Bye-bye. Hello, Mr. Campbell? This is Chief Harper at the Moorehigh Station on West Street. Would you please call me concerning your daughter. She's safe here with us, not in any trouble. I'm at 555-9122 extension 3. Thanks. Jennifer? Jen? Tamara? Tamara? Now where the hell did you go? Hello, Mr. Campbell? This is Sheriff Harper at the Moorehigh Station on West Street. Please call me when you get in concerning your daughter. She's safe here with us. She's not in any trouble. I'm at 555-9122 extension 3. Thanks. Hello, this is your new doctor and I'm standing right behind you. Now, what the hell is that? If you think that's bad, wait until you get my bill. Mr. Campbell? Mr. Campbell? Mother of God. Oh, my God. You owe me 35 years of sleep. You sick son of a bitch. This is gonna take about 40 minutes. You try to relax. I'll be right in the next room, okay? Unit 13... - Is Jennifer okay? - Yeah, she's with the doctor. - The doctor? - Dr. Chamberlain, the girl's okay. You believe us, don't you? Why you grabbing me? Don't you? Let's just say I'm getting there. Grab a seat. What are you doing? Chasing nursery rhymes. Scalpel. Oooh. Oh. That smarts. Oh. Retractor. Suction. Forceps. Prepare to close. Physician, heal thyself. Just how long are you gonna sit there? As long as it takes. We're scanning every felony in a radius of... Why the fuck am I telling you? Tss. This guy's out there, Reitz, I saw him. He's out there. You may be right. Tarawood. Escaped from Tarawood State Hospital two weeks ago. A 42-year old male schizophrenic. Killed three hospital personnel. ID unknown, orphaned at age 7. He's 40. That means born in 1952... ...and orphaned in 1959. What does all this mean? I doubt I could convince anyone else, but I'm taking another look at that house. - I'm going. - Like hell you are. Sit down and wait for your parents. Like hell I'm not. Hello. Is this Chief Harper? This is Joe Campbell, Jennifer's father. I see. I'm on my way. Dr. Chamberlain. Dr. Chamberlain! You're supposed to be relaxing. The machine. I'm sorry, Jennifer. I'm afraid we have to go in. Dr. Chamberlain, what are you doing? Don't worry, Jennifer. It's just a routine operation. Jennifer, Jennifer. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's Dr. Chamberlain. You're in my office, everything's fine, you had a nightmare. Come on, sit up. Take a deep breath. You all right? Let me just check the readout, okay? Well, up until just now, things looked pretty good. Wave patterns seem to be just about where they should be. I think you're gonna be fine. If I were you, I'd get a second opinion. Well, here we are. Jennifer. My problem is... ...I care too much. This isn't happening. That is very unprofessional of you, doctor. - Stay away from her. - Still... ...I'm not above showing a little professional courtesy. How about a free examination? Shh. Reflexes seem normal. Let's check the blood pressure. Oh! Now... ...relax and breathe normally. I'm afraid the news is bad. I give you six seconds to live. Any last words, doctor? Either you're dead or my watch has stopped. Lights out. Doctor's orders. Hmm. Oh. Oh, shit. - Doctor. - I'm calling the hospital now. No, no, no... A doctor... ...did this. And how are we feeling? Just relax. It'll all be over before you know it. - No. - No need to be shy around me, young lady. Oh, sorry. These things get cold. It's broken all right. Never a nurse around when you need one. Too small. Too big. Hmm. Just right. Shit. My father finished this after my mother died. He never got to use it. It was too late. You'll be the first, Jennifer. You see, Jennifer... ...before we can replace the broken heart... ...we have to stop it from beating. Plain... ...and simple. There will be no medication, just a single jolt of electricity. It's a necessary step. I promise. You may be having second thoughts... ...but when you wake up... ...you'll have a change of heart. Don't move. - I don't believe you had an appointment. - Get the fuck away from her. Have a heart. Ah! Shit. One, two. Time to do what doctors do best. Four, five, six, seven, eight... ...nine, 10, 11, 12. Help. Shh. I'm Officer Reitz, okay? Listen to me. I'm going to get you out of here... ...but first, I'm gonna make sure it's clear. Now, I need your help, kid. I need you to be quiet and don't move. I'll be right back. Officer Reitz. Stay there, okay? Don't move. Jen. - Jeez. What the fuck are you doing here? It's all right. I'm sorry. Look, we don't have no time for this shit. Come on. Let's go. I got you. - What happened here? - Just move. Keep moving. Keep moving. Don't look, Jen, just shut your eyes, okay? Just shut your eyes. Jen, are you okay? Shit. Get up, come on. I'm getting you out of here, Jen, okay? Getting out of here. Cover your eyes. Max. - Visiting hours are over. - Ah! Should have used an eight iron. Ah! You know what happens when children play with guns? No! Over here, motherfucker. Come on, Max. Max. Max, come on. This is going to hurt you more than it hurts me. No. Ah! I haven't discharged you. Max? We can still make it. Don't make me laugh. Grab my hand. I can't hold on. I've never lost a patient, Jennifer. Jennifer! I can't breathe, Max. Dr. Alfred and Dr. Jones, to O.R. Stat. The strain was too much on the valve. Administer pre-surgical meds and have an O.R. Ready immediately. Okay, Jennifer. Scoot over, please. Oh, my God. Okay, honey. Here we go. Now, I want you to count backwards, slowly from 100. One hundred, 99, 98... ...ninety seven, 96. Who the hell are you? I'm her doctor. What in God's name are those? Just a little something I threw together. Of course, they haven't been tested yet. You were dead. I'm not that good a doctor. Jennifer, there's still time. Let's pick up where we left off. Is it my bedside manners? Jennifer, it's time to take your medicine. Try some of your own medicine. Ah! Ahh. Huhn! - Ah! I don't feel well. Take two and call me in the morning. - Uh-huh-huh? - Uhn! Is there a... ...doctor in the house? Hey, sport. Hi, Daddy. How you feeling? Feeling okay. Heck of a way to start off the summer, huh?
