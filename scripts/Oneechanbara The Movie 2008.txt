The living dead started to attack people, and they became zombies who, in turn, attacked others. Desperate people would kill family members to survive. Madness engulfed the whole world. I'm on a roll tonight! Now it's my turn. Shit! You've got your eyes closed... Stop joking around! Give it to me! Got a problem, punk? Oh, no... Hey, woman... you're good. I'm hiding here! I'm looking for a woman. Her name is... Saki. Stop! Hold it right there. You're both so tense. We're living in a world where the dead rise... and eat their own wives and children. Why are two living humans trying to kill each other? We won't learn anything about Saki here. Let's get out of this cesspit. You'd better leave, too. Let's find somewhere to sleep for the night. Wait! That woman you're looking for... I know where she is. What did you say? You know Saki? I'm after Dr. Sugita. Dr. Sugita of D3 Corporation? Yes. The man devoted to resurrection research. He's responsible for all the zombies. According to my sources... Saki is with him. I'll take you there on one condition... What do you want? Help me kill him. That's all. What do you think? That's a 'yes'. Take us there. O ONE ONECH ONECHAN ONECHANBA ONECHANBARA What is life? Is it when cells sustain themselves... and reproduce... to form a separate organism? Wrong. Is it about birth and aging until functioning stops? No. That's not it, either! After decades of research, I've finally found the answer. I give each cell its own willpower. Combining cells with blood can resurrect the dead. My invention makes me superior to God. Don't you agree? Do you understand? Good... very good. You got it? Was that enough sleep? Good. Come to me. That's right. Come here so I can see your face better. You miserable defect! Oh well... I have plenty of others to replace you. What I need is someone who is young, strong... and dead... to complete my research. I need blood from the ancient Imichi Clan... Yes... Where is Saki? Where are you, Saki? Saki? Saki! So, what's your story? I can smell blood on you. How many have you killed so far? How about calling me by my name? Oh, sorry. I'm Katsuji. What's your name? I'm Reiko. Reiko. The unfriendly one over there, is Aya. We've killed every zombie that we've come across. Wow, that's impressive... Aya is heiress to the Imichi Clan. A master assassin. I'm the brains. Together, we can take on all the zombies, and more! Right, Aya? She is a bit stuck-up... I think I deserve some thanks... It was a joke! I'm joking... Put that away. Good. That's right. I guess I said too much. You're very dependable. I got it open! Damn... the first food in 3 days! Aren't you eating? Why is she... She might not show it, but she respects you. But... She's been like that since I first met her. I'm going to finish this off! We've been travelling together so long... but I haven't seen her smile once. I heard it's because she saw... her little sister kill their father. Apparently, it was pretty gruesome. Aya never smiles. She never cries, either. I guess it left her emotionally drained. All that keeps her going is her hatred for her sister. That's how it seems to me. The sister who killed their father is... Saki. Saki is Aya's little sister. After being with her this long, I can almost hear her soul... screaming out in agony. And me? My sister was abducted by Dr. Sugita, Saki and the zombies. It was on a hot summer day. They came out of nowhere. I fought them. I didn't mind risking my life for my sister. But then Saki stepped in. I was dragged away from my sister... and she was taken away. My sister's name is Asami. Look, she's cute, isn't she? After that, I met Aya. She didn't talk much, but we understood each other. Our sadness made us compatible. I remember the coldness of Aya's eyes. We've been hunting zombies together ever since. As for me... my daughter was killed by them. How did the world become like this, anyway? Not so long ago, we had hot meals waiting for us and families to go home to. What will you do after you get revenge? I want to go around helping the survivors. Oh, yeah... I forgot about this. You're not zombies. What are you doing here? That's some greeting you gave me. I told you to hide. We're just travellers camping here, if you don't mind. Suit yourself. But you'd better not move around, if you want to live. Why's that? What's with them? We'd better get some sleep, too. Ken! Ken. Yuki, run! Hurry! Yuki. You've got to be kidding... Stay back! Wait a minute... Wait. I mean it. You could have hit me with that thing! Wait! Time for your school lunch. You don't have to be scared. Eat it. That's a good girl. I've decided... You're going to be my next masterpiece. What's wrong? There's nothing to be scared of. Come closer to me. Brother... I said, come closer! What's that look for? Why are you looking at me like that? I can't tolerate bad girls! I'll take a look around. That's horrible... Did I make you wait? You won't have to wait anymore, Saki. Sorry for kicking you. But everything is okay now. This will make you better. That's right. From now on, you'll feel fine... It's okay. Is this your doll? Don't be scared. I won't do anything bad. Come on. This is really important to me. My daughter used to wear it. Don't go too far, Maria. Asami? Are you Asami? It's me! Your brother! Don't you recognize me? Come on, Asami. Let go of the girl. Asami! Asami. It's me. I know that you know who I am. This can't be... You must be joking! Aya, don't! It's my... little sister. You've changed so much... I'm sorry for what you went through. I'm sorry I couldn't rescue you. When Saki attacked us, I left you and ran. I was so scared that I ran. I left you and... ran away. Say something. Come on. You have to forgive me. Open your eyes, please. Saki... It's you! Get up. Saki! Maria, hang on... Maria. I'll look for some medicine. Maria. Asa... Oh, it's just me... You're joking... It's no use. Don't you dare! Stay away from her! She'll become one of them. I'll shoot anyone who hurts her. I'm serious. Put the sword down. This girl... and only her... will not be killed! This zombie is stupid. Aya! Let's go! Hurry, before we get surrounded! I won't leave her here. Give it up! It's too late for her! It isn't! If you want to be zombie food... suit yourself! I won't let her die the same way as my daughter... You mean you... I shot her. I shot my own daughter to death. Once she was a zombie, she wasn't your daughter. You're lying! I'm not. I had to kill my sister when she turned into a zombie! I feel sorry for you but now isn't the time for this. Get real! Do you want to be one of them? Put the zombies back to eternal sleep. That's what we're fighting for! Let's go, Aya! We can get out that way. Are you staying? What? Mother... I'm not afraid. Let's go and get the main course now. Aya... I've been waiting for you. I love those eyes of yours. Sugita! Don't interfere! I've been looking all over for you, Aya. I noticed one day... that I needed you for my research. I needed the doomed blood of the Imichi Clan. I looked for an Imichi. And I found one. I found a girl with pure breeding from the Imichi Clan. But my path never crossed yours. Your father got in my way. So, I had to have him killed. You should have seen it. He died squealing like a pig. It's been 10 years since then. I've been looking for you all these years... with help from my loyal servants. Saki. You get Saki. I'll get the doctor! There's lots to catch up on, but work comes first. Brilliant... This is so beautiful. Sugita! Who are you? You killed my sister! Your sister? Which one are you referring to? You pathetic creature. You don't deserve to live. It's time to die. You... I am God! I'm the ruler of the world. You deserve it. Help me, please! You're asking for help? Go to Hell and apologize to everyone! Reiko! Reiko. You're hurt. Reiko. Die! Why did you kill Father? I just wanted to be strong. This is a fine sword, Master Oboro. The sword that survived for generations in your family. Show your father how strong you've become. Begin! Very good. Your sister has been chosen. She is the rightful heiress of our clan. Don't be afraid. You have a great talent. Do you want to become strong? I've always been lonely. They deserted me because you were chosen. I had to become strong. So, I killed Father. Now I'll kill you. Aya! Help me kill him. That's all. I'm sorry I couldn't rescue you. I won't let her die the same way as my daughter... Put the zombies back to eternal sleep. That's what we're fighting for! Saki. Why... Why can't I beat you? Don't talk anymore... If I had the power... I'd be just like you... I was afraid to be alone. I thought I'd be free from it if I became strong. Your tears are warm. Saki. My sister... Saki. Saki. Let's go and kick some zombie ass, shall we?
