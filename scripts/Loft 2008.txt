Look, they tricked us. It was a setup. So you were framed? Is that it? - That you yourself are a victim? - Not like that... Not like... Not like who, Mr. Stevens? Not like her? Not like this? - Have you checked the story of the others? - We are working on it, don't worry. So this all is a big conspiracy, If I get this right. Why don't you make it yourself easy and confess? Tell us again what happened this morning? - Again? - Again, Mr. Stevens. From the beginning, if you would be so kind. - Where were you this morning, Mr. Stevens? - Home. - My wife is gone skiing with the kids. - Not anymore. She's going to join us soon. And I think she had also quite a few questions to ask. You received a wake-up call this morning. What time did you get that call? That must have been around 10.30. It was Luc. Completely in panic. He said something bad happened, I had to come right away. - Luc Seynaeve? - Luc, yes, yes. Luc. Where did he want you to go? The loft. I had come straight to the loft. - Did he tell you why he was in panic? - No. - Did you know why he was in a panic? - No. Not yet. Luc? Luc? What is it? Jesus. What happened here? I do not know, Vincent. I really do not know. - Do you have something to do with this? - No. I came in and she was there. - Don't touch. We wait for the police. - Did you call the police? - Not yet, but that's... - Let's not call them yet, Okay? Jesus, man. - Goddamn. Did you call the others already? - Marnix and Chris are on their way. - Filip I could not reach. - Keep calling. Everyone should come. Who is that? Do you know? - Do you know who it is? - Of course not. - How did they break in? - The door wasn't damaged and the alarm was off. - Can't be. - The door was locked and the alarm was off. That can't be. That would mean... I know. Someone entered with one of our keys. Goddamn, Luc. What happened here? - Do you know the building at the Tavernierkaai? - No. - The project of your good friend Vincent. - Vincent has many projects. There is a loft on the top floor. Doesn't ring a bell? - No. - Never been? No. Strange, according to our information you share the loft with your friends. In secret. Your wifes don't know about it. - That is ridiculous. - Is that so? So you never take women to that place? Hookers, shags. - The fresh fish of the day? - This is just... Five friends who want privacy when they cheat on their women. No struggling with hotel bills, credit cards, things your wife could find. - That is really ridiculous. - Don't act like you're innocent, dude. One of your mates confessed everything already Scary, huh? Don't you wanna know who? - I don't do those kind of things. - You love your wife? Yes. I love my wife, yes. - What happened to your eye? - I bumped onto a closet. - Catched a fight? - I bumped onto a closet. Where were you this morning? I had breakfast with Chris in the city. There are witnesses. Chris Van Outryve? Dr Van Outryve. The psychiatrist. One of your loft friends. Chris is married, has children. Not the kind of man who'd cheat on his wife. Come... All innocent fathers at home. - Where is she? - We have a serious problem, Chris. Goddamn. - Filip... - What are you saying now Chris, Filip? - Do you think your brother is behind this? - I don't know what to think. This is gonna hit us like a boomerang. Elsie, the children... - We should call the police. - Hold on, Chris. You know what happens then, right? Do you want Ellen to learn all about this? We have a dead body on our hands now. We have no choice. Chris, if he's right, if Filip is involved, we have to turn your brother in. His name popped up first in your head too? Remember last time? - Or have you already forgotten? - No. We think alike, eh, Chris? Not? We can help him. We are friends, if he tells us what happened. Then what? Get rid of the body, or what? Nuts. Listen, I'm not gonna pay for his mistakes. Oh, this can't be. Oh, kiss my fucking balls now. - We have a serious problem, Marnix - Man... - Do you know if Filip has been here? - How can this be? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? - I want to see her. - Oh, Jesus, man. Stay away from her. Stay away from her, Chris. Who is it? - Who is it? - I don't know. One of us is involved in this, right? - Huh? Right? - We're gonna find out what happened. and we're gonna find a way to fix this. This can't be leaked. We are friends, ok? - They really let everyone in here. - Hey, Vince. Well done. Ellen, it's been too long. You look fantastic. Thank you, Vincent. - It is a clever design. Congratulations. - Merci. - Hey. - Hey, Barbara. - Dag. Day, Ellen. - Barbara. - Don't you wanna buy a apartment here? - I'm afraid we can't afford that. That is true. With your salary. You're such a poor guy. - Hey, we see eachother later. Okay? - Yes, that's fine. Honey, one hour, no longer. Then we leave. Honey, we just got here. Don't start. Jesus, did you see the hot womenl walking around here? Oh, my God. - Look, look, that ebony... - Yeah. - Have you seen her? - I've seen her. Calm down, man. That looks like a hot babe. Wouldn't mind chasing her in the jungle. - She even gets a 100 meter lead. - Marnix, quiet. Miriam looks. - Crap, I'm busted. - What? Having fun, fatty? Going easy, babe. Just checking out the people. Don't embarras me or I leave you behind here. Don't give me false hope, honey. Always t hose promises. - Luc. Elsie is not there? - She felt a little dizzy. - She gone to measure her sugar balance. - How is she doing actually? - Here, Elsie. Everything good? - I just had a bad moment. - But it's okay now. - If you feel sick, we go home, ok sweety. 'Sweety'... And she has just checked her sugar balance. Do you find that funny, fatty? At least he cares for his wife. What would you do, if I had that? But honey, I'd love to give you a shot in your ass every day. May I ask you something? You're a psychiatrist, right? - Yes, Chris Van Outryve. - Doctor van Outryve true. That was it. - Do we know each other? - No, you've known my sister. She has in therapy with you. Sofie. Sofie Marai. I'm terribly sorry for what happened to your sister. Oh well, some people are just born unhappy. You should know that, doctor. Yes... I don't understand it though. We made alot of progress the last few weeks. But that last leap forward wasn't a big success, was it? Ten floors. - Have you bought an apartment here? - No, the architect is a friend. - You? - Me? No, no, no... I'm here with the mayor. I work for him. I'm his... personal assistant, so to speak. - Ah yes. Interesting? - Not really. - I'm Ann. Ann Marai. - Sorry about your sister. Don't be bothered. You couldn't save her anyway. It's a family thing, I think. You aren't planning anything silly either, I hope. I don't do anything else, doctor. I always fall for the wrong guy. Aah! Okay. Everything under control. Thank you. - Hey, everything ok? - Filip? - Filip? - Thank you. Hey, Vincenzo. This isn't your first party today, huh? Sorry my friend fell into the champaign, I'll introduce you. This is a colleague from the office. And that is a colleague from beneath desk. Oh, no. My brother is here already to pull on my ears. - Hey, Chris. Everything good? - Yes. Vicky's girlfriends? or are you babysitting? Can't I enjoy life for a lil while. I'm still not married after all. It's not like I don't love Vicky. But it aint bad in someone elses bed either. It's good you're here because I'd wanna show you guys something. Come. - Where are Marnix and Luc? - No idea. Chris? Aren't you coming? There we go. - So guys, what do you think? - Nice. Beautiful, man. But what are we doing here Gotta finish the interior, but this is an oasis of rest in the middle of the city Looks like theres still alot of work on your oasis. A place where nobody can bother you, where you can meet with whoever you want. Wouldn't that be fun? This place where you can... How should I say? - Steal time. - Steal time? - Should I sell it? - Would you like to keep yourself? - With a few friends, for example. - To do what? Those waiters aint going to visit us up here, I guess? I go back. Give me your key. Then I can show Filips chicks every corner of this room. Stay here. These are decent girls. Hey. Do you know what they cost me? - Why hire a loft, Vincent? - Nobody has to know what you do here. The idea you can come here, without anyone knowing. - Do not be silly. You know what I mean. - I know, but I'm not like that, Vince. You know that. - Luc neither, I think. - Aren't we all a little like that? Or wouldn't we all wanna be a little like that? Yes, if you say so... You can also just read your newspaper here. Come on. I have to go, I can't stay here. - I cant stay here. - Where are you going? Luc?! You can't run away. This is not the time. - We have to go through this together. Like we agreed. - Marnix, calm down! - Luc, we can't panic now. - It's over. Don't you realize it?! - It's gonna explode in our face - Wrong. We are gonna fix this. Leave a message after the beep. I'll call back. Shit, man. What do we do if he doesn't come? If he ran away? Filip wome come. He must come. He has no choice. What if it's like last time? We can't protect him forever. Guys. Man, what is this again? What does that mean? Chris, what does that mean? - Do you know Latin, doctor? - Sorry? If you know Latin? Yes. Yes, I... I know Latin. Yeah, sorry. Ah. Then maybe you can explain what's written on this wall here. Fatum nos iungebit. Yes... I can read that myself. But what does it mean? Huh? Fatum nos iungebit, fate will unite us. Fate. Or death. As you wish. Written with her blood. Now it appears that the victim wasn't exactly someone who knew Latin. So it's most likely someone else wrote it. But with her finger, huh. Like this. Someone who knows Latin, doctor. - Fatum nos iungebit is wrong. - What do you mean, wrong? The term uniting, is not iungebit, but iunget. It should be: "fatum nos iunget". The one you are looking for made a classic Latin language mistake.. But that you probably knew already, as well? Do you know the term "fuck you"?! That's not Latin, but you understand it too, don't you? Where is your brother, doctor? Everyone is here except him. We can't seem to track him down. I do not know where he is. Sorry. - He is actually your half brother, right? - Yes. Same mother, different father. Spend some time in institutions with his sister. They were put there after our mother died. - Filip had less luck with his father. - Apparently. A heavy alcoholic. Hit his children. You two never had much contact. And now you are best friends. Yes. We have... alot to catch up. What is that? "Faith will unite us" Is that ment for us? Chris? Is that ment for us? And where the heck is Filip, dammit? - Everyone is here except him. - How should I know where he is? What the fuck is this? It's from here. That's a knife from the kitchen. We are gonna get the blame for this, don't you realize that? - Where is Filip? Goddamn. - What do you think? Can someone tell me what happened here? - You, asshole. Sadist! - What is it, friend? Hey. What is it? Stop! This isn't the moment for that now. Touch me one more time and you'll end up next to her, faggot. - Filip, you got anything to do with this? - Why should I? You know you can count on us, if you need a good lawer, we'll... - I don't need a lawyer. - Quiet, Filip. - Have you been here tonight? - No. I slept at Vickys place last night. Call her if you don't believe me. What took you so long to get here? Because this morning I was at a construction site, I couldn't just walk away there. Very funny when theres a whining idiot on your voice-mail: - "There's a dead body in the loft." - I don 't get it. And where have you been? Before you accuse everyone. Where have you been? - I was home yesterday. - Yes? Witnesses? You don't believe me? No, no witnesses. Barbara is in Les Arcs with the children. If any of us has something to do with this, then speak up now. Now is the time. Now. - Thank you, beautiful. - Congratulations. Filip's life is over as well now. I'll raise a pint to that. - Who is his father in law? - He there. Ludwig Tyberghein, "Daddy Concrete". Construction projects from here till Tokyo. Stinking rich. It is his only daughter. - So Filip won the lottery with her? - Yes... He looks very happy. Come on, Chris, she looks like a good girl? Oh look, what a happy bunch. Since Van Esbroeck became mayor, buildings pop up all over the city thanks toTyberghein. - Wasn't he at the opening of your building? - To show his rich arrogant face, yes. But when it's pay time, they rather work with their own architects. Aw, you can't play with the big boys? That ain't fair, huh. Shouldn't be. Like you can draw houses. Come on, my beautiful costume. Nice huh? Don't you think so? Such a nice wedding party. Money can not buy happiness. That's what they want the poor people to believe. - Ain't I right? - Yes... Guys, you lost him now. - He's mine now. - Congratulations, Vicky. - You picked out a special one, you know that right? - I know. I will tame him. - Right, honey? - Of course. The bird is in my cage and I have the key. But a golden cage, eh, buddy. - Can I say? - Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Next month Filip will start working with my dad. No more stinking in your bed till 2pm. Hit the road with daddy selling houses. Watch out or I'll throw you out. I have security for gangsters like you. Let's go to open some more envelopes. - No, I stay a little while with my friends. - Yes. Ok. Ciao. Seen enough uptight people for now. Filip... - My present. - Really? Take care. There are only five copies. Accepting the key, is accepting the rules. - Our women are here. Are you crazy? - The loft is finished. A present from me to all of you. But you aren't like that, huh. Look, if not for now, maybe it comes in handy later. You know how life can go. Luc boy, want one? Make sure this wont explode in your face. - Our own loft. - Just need to find someone to go with you, huh Marnix? There's plenty of fish in the sea. But damn, those rich ones breed well. Look, that young thing there. Look, look. With the black hair and green dress. - Wouldn't mind bumping into her. - She might be just seventeen... No, she is eighteen and you won't touch her. - Why? You want her, or what? - That is Sharon. - Is that Sharon? "Skinny" Sharon? - Yes, yes, that's Sharon. Is that your little sister? She's got beautiful, man. A few more summers and you can pluck the flower, I think. - Although, I think she's ripe already. - Marnix, enough. - What? - It is enough. It is enough. Besides, the seed of a friend doesn't hurt, right? - I'm thirsty. Won't we drink something? - I get something. - Pint? - Pint. - Never talk about my sister like that again, okay? - Yes. Nono, I mean it. Touch her with one finger, and you wont produce any more seed. - Understood? - Yes, Filip. Ouch! That was a joke, uh, man. Wacko. Hi, Chris. - Hi. - I don't know if you still remember, but we have met each other before at the opening of that building. - Yes, I remember. Ann Marai. - So you remember me? That's nice. You now also work on weekends. The mayor should be happy. The mayor can go to hell. You're job includes something more than just being his assistant, huh? And what do you mean by that, Mr. psychiatrist? Have you seen something else perhaps? - You don't look really happy. - Oh, I see. I can see it's no fun to walk around alone at partys such as this. Afterwards, when you are alone with him, you'll become number one again. But slowly but sure you realize you probably will remain his second choice forever. He says will leave his wife for me. Is he saying that? For how long? I've told you so. I always fall for the wrong men. Shall I tell you something? A secret. Something that remains between us. You know what gives him a kick, our good innocent mayor? He finds' t great at places like this To keep my panties in his pocket. It excites him. If he sees me, knowing that wear nothing underneath my clothes. Jesus. I don't understand why you let them walk over you. Who says I let them walk over me? Perhaps it excites me too. Maybe I find it exciting to tell you. Make sure you don't catch a cold. Chris, sorry. Yes, I do not know why... I do not know why I said that. - Maybe I wanted to test you. - I don't need to be tested. Can I have a conversation with you? With a cup of coffee. Somewhere in private. Please? Vincent, that key, I would like to use it after all. Not for what you think. I bring him back as soon as possible. Chris, it's never for what I think it is. Have fun. Wait, men, come... Does everyone have his key on him? - Sure. - Seriously, let's think this over. There are five keys. If anyone would want to make a copy, he'd need a code. The code is in my safe. Noone broke in here, so to be sure, does everyone have his key? You think we share our keys or what? That's against the rules, your rules, Vince. - Can everyone show his key? - What do you think you'll win by that? Maybe someone lost him. Here is mine. Where is your key, Chris? - You came in without using your key. - Yea, ok. I don't have him on me, ok? Where is he, Chris? I don't have him on me. It's not like I need him every day. - But you still have it? - Wether I have him or not is not important now. Not important? We only have four. Where's the fifth? Goddamn Chris, someone entered with a key. Yes? How do you explain the fact that the alarm was turned off? That means that the one who broke in with the key, also knew the code for the alarm. - Unless... She let him in. - Yes. And how did she got in then? See, no matter how you turn it around, you always end up with us five. I'm getting sick of this, I wanna know who of us is not telling the truth. - And what's the name? - Polyamory. - That's when you have different relationships. - And your boss does that? He has a wife and a girlfriend and who also know it from eachother. I love my wife, but also my girlfriend. Why should I choose? - And his wife accepts? - Yes. What an idiot is she anyway? Wouldn't that be something for, us, boys. "Polyamarie". Here, the fatty. Can't handle one woman. What would you do with two? - Can't you show at least some enthusiasm? - It's your party. - Besides, I have to cook. - Come on, don't be like that.. Chris, if you insist on inviting your friends, at least make sure you'll be home in time. It took a little longer at work. You know how it goes? And what should I do for a little attention? Go into rehab or something? It's not like they are here every day. Just join us. Do it for me. I hope that fat one doesn't throw up in our living room. He drinks whiskey as if it's water. Doesn't his wife notice? Well, Polyamory, all fine, but his wife had him get caught - And threw him out of the house. - What an idiot, that boss of yours. He should keep his mouth. He should have organized it, right, Vince? How did it end? Now he lives in an apartment with the woman of his life. She is 22, blond and has fake breasts. So typically, men loving fake breasts. Women, huh. Always the same when it's about tits. Tits tits tits. If it's done well, what's the problem then? My mom has false teeth. When she smiles, will you go: "ooh my, so fake, o no"? No, people will say: Mmh that's done well. You look better than before. This is an improvement. That's always the same, huh. Chicks, so jealous. - Marnix... - The greatest thing there is is a hot chick. Sorry, this level is a little too high for me. For this much deep philosophy My mind is too small. Maybe you should have a transplantation there. And have your mouth cornered up. - That you can smile now and then. - Marnix. Well, Miriam, I really admire you. You've picked out the best one. You know what it is? That guy should have organized better. That would be better. You must organize. Eh, boys? Yeah, okay, good. How would you organize it? Yes, you must ensure that you find a place where they can not catch you. That is the key... That is the key of... of time. Of stealing time. It seems like you already have considered. Soon we'll get strange thoughts of you. Hey, Vince... Vincy Boy... Don't joke, eh, buddy. Hey. Crick crack, key in the pocket. The key of the... Marnix. Let's get some air. That'll do you good. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, boys. Don't worry Miriam. You know he's always like that when he's drunk. Why don't I have a guy like you? - Oh... Sorry. - No problem. I was a little uncomfortable because of the food. That thai... That's spicy, huh. That can cut through your nose. Yes, indeed, yes. Whatever. We need to get new insulin. These are almost gone. Luc, is there something you must tell me? - What would I have to tell you? - Do you have secrets for me? Of course not. Is there somebody else you love? - You can tell me. - Why do you ask such weird questions? - No, I don't cheat on you. - But I didn't ask that, Luc. I asked if there was somone else that you... Au... Elsie, I may not be that exciting as the rest. but I'll always be there for you. Always. For you and for the children. I wouldn't know what to do without you, Luc. I'd tolerate alot. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - She needs to get out of here. That's impossible, Vincent. She's chained. Can't you see, goddamned. Can't you see what's going on? Someone is trying to set us up. - Who would want to do that? - Think for a minute. A dead body chained with handcuffs, that quote, that knife. In our loft. Anyone else knows of our dates? Did any of you ever said too much? - You, Marnix? - What? Why me? - Don't know, you drink alot... - No. Are you crazy? - I've always followed the rules. - Haven't told anyone the code of the alarm? - Or entered the code when someone was looking? - No. Why are you looking at me? What are you trying to say? Maybe someone wants revenge. Someone who wants everything to be leaked. Who would want to take revenge? I don't know. A husband of some girl, a jealous boyfriend, an ex-girlfriend. Is there anyone of us in trouble? - I think you're sweet. - Oh, that sounds a little pathetic, huh. No. You are one of the good men. A little strange to say, given the circumstances. I don't know. - Whose loft is this anyway? - From a friend. - He's gone for business. - For long, apparently. I love you, Ann. You don't have to tell me such things, Chris. - I mean it. - And... Why? Because you feel you need to say it. I've never cheated on my wife before. I don't fall in love quickly. I don't want you to be in love with me. Besides, we only meet on exciting moments. - This is not life. - I would like to give it a chance, Ann. If you are not going to stop now, I'll say mean things. I'm sick of the lies. All that sneaky stuff. I want to tell Ellen everything... and I'll leave her. The only people who can hurt you, are the ones you really love. I will never hurt you. But I am not talking about you. You don't know me. - Give me the chance to meet you. - I'm a whore, Chris. Okay? I go to bed with men for money. That is what I am. A whore. - What are you saying now? - Do not worry. I won't send you a bill for the past few months. - What do you say now? - Leave it. You don't know half of it yet. - Is your friend Chris cheating on his wife? - I'd,.. I doubt it, madam. He is a devoted husband... And an exemplary family man, like all your friends? You could all start a shop. But you've surely done a few bad things, huh, pal? Why does your wife want to divorce? Divorcing is a heavy word. we just live separated for a while. - Why? - My wife has found out something... - Which is... why she got angry. - You cheated on her? If you insist on making it so technically... Yes. - And how did she find out? - The person with whom I had... - Who you cheated her with. - Right. She had apparently expected more after that incident. She suddenly stood on our doorstep and that stupid... That lady started to tell a bunch of things. I hope my wife forgives me quickly, because I love her. Cheating is not the problem. It's when they find out, eh? - Have you been with her to the loft? - No, that happened in Dsseldorf. - In Dsseldorf? - Why were you there? There was an event. Vince had a few VIP cards. and there were about two left. A few nights in a fancy hotel, away from home. - And you were one of the lucky ones? - Yes... I was one of the lucky ones, yes. You don't dare. 100 Euro. 200 Euro. They are staring at you the whole time. Invite them. You can have her, I'll take the rest then. - In your dreams. - These girls do not interest me. You could shag them if you want. That you let a chance like that pass by. - Too easy. - Come on, Vince. I fall more for women which are worthwhile. The special. - I like to find the unknown islands. - Look, there. The entire island group together. An atoll. Vince, does Barbara know you sometimes make a discovery trip? - Why would I want to hurt her? - Seynaeve, quiet, eh, man. You got a key too for the loft. What are you doing there? Washing the dishes? Look, more Belgians in the hotel, I hear. My name is Anja. I wait for a colleague from work. - It's expensive here, huh. - You want a drink from us? Oh, yes, that is kind. Can that be something else but a pint? - What are you drinking? Is that champaign? - Yes. Vince, she's gonna scare all the pretty chicks away, huh, man. A glass of champaign. Every ugly girl has a beautiful girlfriend. Yes, and what if she's the prettiest one? Look, look, look, look... Well what do you know, Daddy Concrete is here too. And not with Mama Concrete. - All men are the same, eh. - So much wisdom, I drink to that. You are a strange dude. A bottle of champaign and four glasses for the table in the back. Werent you guys at the wedding of my Vicky? Friends of Filip. You are the architect. - Vincent Stevens. I have... - I know. Perhaps we can make a deal or something. I can always use an architect. - Great, Mr.. Tyberghein. - I have a big project in Antwerp. On the Left Bank. Apartment blocks. Luxury Apartments. Very trendy and all that nonsense. It would perhaps be something for you. But for now it's still a big secret. So I hope that you .. can be discreet. - It would be challenging... - Discretion, Mr. Stevens. You understand? Sapienti dictum est. A good listener needs only half the words. - Are you a good listener? - Absolutely, absolutely. I'm in the software and I can be very discreet as well. Put the drinks from these people on my account. - Gentlemen, good evening. - Thank you Miss... Who does this asshole think he is? Sapienti dictum, my balls. Here, here. There's another one on a discovery trip. That is the whore of the mayor, Marnix. Hi, this is Ann Marai. Speak your message after the beep. Who are you calling this late? - Nothing. Nobody. checking Voicemail. - Checking your voicemail? And what did your voicemail say? "You're a bad liar, Chris Van Outryve? - Why do you ask? Is there anything? - I don't know. Maybe I should ask you. Ellen... I go to bed. - Do you turn off the lights? - Ellen. Men only think with that thing between their legs. What are all those Women magazines saying? Two things. What pigs men are and how to seduce them. Why would you take a whole pig, when you only need a little part of it? I can'r leave you alone for a minute. A minute? Sarah, honey, I am here for an hour waiting for you. Luckily I am sponsored. Wouldn't you introduce me to your new friends? - Was that the first time you saw her? - Yeah, that was the first time. - Sarah Delporte. - Sarah, yeah. What else happened in Dsseldorf? - What do you want to know? - Everything. - If they catch us, we'll get kicked out. - Sarah... You shouldn't have challenged me. - Ah, there it is, the swimming pool. - Vince, lets go back? - Soon we are gonna regret this. - Come, Luc. - Isn't it very exciting. - A little too exciting for me. Come on, Vincent. Undress. Yes... Yes, you wanted to swim naked. We have bet, so now I want my prize. I feel my food come back up. How? You've seen nothing yet. You aren't joking, eh? Anja? Anja? Yes... - There. - What, There! - More? - Yes, more. Yes, that's no bad actually for such an old guy. - You like to play games. - Who's the one playing games? Challenging me to come to this place so you won't have to ask me anymore As if I... Oh... Hey! Come on. Your turn. Come. Luc, is it still too exciting for you or do you feel comfortable now? - Good, huh? - Wonderful. - Luc, why don't you join? - No, I'm good. Yes, but Luc, I actually... need you, This is the moment Vincent will try his move on me. And if you're in here, he might not dare to. - You're really a rude girl, arent you? - Ain't I right, or what? Spreading compliments all evening long. and then that naughty look. Do it again, your look. That eye contact which lasts a little too long... Really. - Vincent, you're very good. - I agree. Did you really think I gave you the green light or what? - Sorry, but now you disappointed me a little. - You really like to play games. You know what? I am better at them than you. - Do you feel me? - Yes. Marnix? Are you here? Marnix? I would like the key to our room. - Marnix. - Luc boy, leave us alone, friend. You're scared. You run away for what you feel. Am I right? Huh? I don't want a goodbye. Sorry it has to end like this, Sarah. Can you do that even? Loving someone. I'm sorry. - Why do you throw that away? - Because it is empty. You were here yesterday, huh, dude? If you were here, why don't you say that? We are your friends. She was still here when I left. She was still alive. Someone must have joined her. Then tell us. You just make the situation alot worse like that. We'd better call the police. - We can't solve this ourself. - Are you crazy! What are we gonna tell them? And what about our women? - I think Vince has to tell us something. - Ah? What do you want to tell us, Vincent? Fuck. Come on, pick up. Hello. Who is it? A real estate office. For the loft. - Someone put the loft on sale - What? - See, I was right. Goddamned - Chris, How is that possible? She has an appointment with a certain Sarah Delporte. Who is Sarah Delporte? Guys, who is that? And who jas put this on sale? She? - You know her, Marnix. - What? What do you say now? That you know her. And Luc too. Sarah Delporte lays there. - I've never seen her. - You're lying, you know her. - Why do you say that? - From in Dsseldorf. A few months ago, that last evening in the bar. It was the girlfriend of that Anja. - I was completely wasted. I don't remember anything. - I know, Marnix. - But not you, eh, Luc? - Is that her? Damn. - Don't be silly. You've talked with her. - How could I know that's her. I don't know who it is. You guys turned her around. Not me. - You know her or not? - Chris, if there is a corpse, you won't think about some girl you once met in some bar. He is twisting the facts. Don't you understand that? Madam? You are mistaken. We do not know Sarah Delporte. Come, Filip. - You know her? - I can't see anything. Who is that, man? Who is that? That was it, Vincent? What you had to tell us? We had something, okay? I brought her here. But I swear on the souls of my children, I have nothing to do with this. On the souls of your children? Jesus, man. Were you here yesterday with her? Were you the person who let her in? I don't want a goodbye. I broke up with her last night, yes. Vincent man... I swear, I left her alive. And even that does not explain why someone put our loft for sale. Looking for something special sir or is he just looking around? Why don't you call me back? If you dump me, then I at least have the guts to say it. Chris, how can I dump you now? We have nothing together. Ah, was it that? Nothing? Ok. Let's not make it harder. You know now what I am. It doesn't matter who or what you are. Really not, Ann. How many women have you taken to that loft of yours? That Loft that you share with your friends. Keep your bullshit for the next girl you'll take to that place. Wait. Ann, you know I am not like that. You know. - I've seen better men than you. - Wait. Here. I only need this when we are together anyway. Keep him. If you want to see me, I'll hear it. Chris? What are you doing here? Are you shopping for Ellen? Day, Elsie. No, I was here with a colleague of mine. - Does your wife know you share a loft? - Oh woman, I share no loft. I been there once at the opening of the building. So you been there after all? A moment ago you said you didn't even know where it was. I've never been there with a woman. I thought you ment that. - Did you know that girl? - I met her in Dsseldorf. Did you know Mr. Stevens started a relation with her? That would surprise me. Are you sometimes jealous when your good friend Vincent takes all those beautiful women? I'm married and those women don't interest me. No, I'm not jealous of him. No, no, not of him, mister Seynaeve. I mean jealous of those women. What are you insinuating? What nonsense are you thinking off? Where do you get the nerve to insinuate such things? - Why so heavy mister Seynaeve? - Vincent is my best friend. - It's always been like that. - Your friend is betraying the whole gang. Vincent would never betray his friends. You're bluffing. Asshole. - What did you call me? - You heard me, asshole. Accusing me while you... Listen, I told her last night it was over and then I left. - And that's it, man. - That's it? Yes. Seems the word "over" applies to more than just one thing, huh? When did you plan on telling us, Vince? Huh? Put the knife down, Filip. Don't be silly. - Filip! - I don't know what happened afterwards. I swear. I have nothing to do with this. Maybe I was not the only, Perhaps there is someone else she has a relation with. - Someone who wants to put all blame on us. - On you, in that case. Fool. Hey! Man... It appears that it is becoming your problem, Vincent. Don't you see what happens here? Why would she make an appointment with someone to sell a loft which isn't hers? On the day she is found dead inside it. Some coincidence. Why would she do that? Guys, we can't continue like this. Everything is about to get revealed. What will you do, Marnix? Gonna leave me alone with it? Vincent? Are you there? Vince, let me in, please. - Are you crazy? I'm here with someone. - Miriam is gone. - What, Miriam is gone? - Yes. She left me. She knows about that chick from Dsseldorf. That fat girl told her everything. - Vince, you must help me. - Does Miriam know about the loft? What? Of course not. It all happened in Dsseldorf. You were there at the pool. Vince, Miriam is gone. What should I do? - I can't live without her. - You haven't confessed anything yet? Rule one, never confess. You hurt them and they don't understand it. Vince, can't you try to talk with her? Can you tell her... that I love her and that Anja is lying? - She'll believe you, Vince. - I will try that, okay? - It'll be alright. - I love her, Vince. I'll make sure it's gonna be alright. But I fucking hope she doesn't know more than that. - Can you see in what kind of situation you got us? - I never ment this to happen. - What now? - She needs to get away from here. And then we erase all tracks. - We can't let her disappear. - That is the only way to escape. Listen to yourself, you had a relation with that girl. and now she's just a piece of evidence that could destroy your pretty little life. - What kind of person are you? - I don't need a lecture, understood? How do you get her off the bed? Saw her hand off? - Or do you have the keys to the cuffs after all? - No, I have no keys of handcuffs. I thought handcuffs were more your thing. - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. Silence! - Shut up, damn it! - Help me. That slut thinks she can play with my balls. - Help me, please. - Shut up. He is crazy. - He raped me. - Calm down. - Give me the key. - That bitch will go to the police. - The key! - The key? Here is the key. Here is the key. I didn't want to do those things. - He has forced me. - Shut up! What is it? Want more money? Is that it? Here is your fucking money. Are you crazy? Have you gone mad? It's a whore, Chris. And you know what it is with whores? You can not rape them. Isn't that funny? Huh? Damned. That's no way to treat a woman, asshole. Not one! - What's your problem anyway? - Don't touch me. Not with me, pall. Take a look at yourself, dammit! You're gone mad with the coke, you beat up women. Don't you realize you bring us all in great danger? Do you realize that? - I want police. He has beaten me. - Stop it! - He raped me. - Shut up! If you won't keep your mouth shut, I'll beat it shut. You ain't any better than your father, you. Oh. Oh, Chris. Yes, yes... Chris had more luck, eh, with his daddy. Huh? You who always wants to save the world, save everyone. Huh? Where were you? Where were you when we were beaten by him? Huh? And while mother acted as if she didn't know about it. - Far away in your safe house in Leuven. - Goddamn. You... You never looked after us. Never. I had to protect my sister. We meant nothing to you. - We meant nothing to you! - I knew nothing of it, Filip. - If I had known... - Then what? Then I would've taken you away from there, goddamn! Sorry. But we can't go to the police. I'll take you a friend of mine, a doctor. Aah! Vincent, give me everything you have. See? That's what she wanted. Money. Dude, I'm gonna hurt you if you won't shut your mouth. You made me do something today I'll never forgive you. Never. I'll pay you the watch back. What is the problem? Dammit, why didn't you tell us about that? When did it happen? Two weeks ago, Marnix. We would keep it to ourselves. Right, Filip? - Some friends we are. - I have no lessons to take from you. - Certainly not about friendship. - Let that be the reason why I didn't tell the rest. I thought you had something to do with it. That you strumbled in here late at night. - Drunken, stoned, Boiled up. - Kiss my balls, dude. - Shoudln't you better stop using all that coke? - Shouldn't you better stop drinking, alcoholic? Enough guys. You should hear yourself. That's what they want. Have us fight eachother. Someone wants to destroy us. Guys, I'm afraid I also have something to confess. But could someone first stop Filip? - Au! - Filip! I owed you that one, boy. Luc, are you saying now? Didn't you ask to be honost? Cards on the table? - Well, I'm honest. My cards on the table. - And where are they, Luc? And where did you do that? Where did you do that? Jesus. You have to be kidding, eh. Goddamn. Goddamn, Luc. So you record everything that happened here? Every woman we brought here? Not always. Sometimes. - How sometimes? When you like the program? - At least I'm not cheating on my wife. - No, just you watch. - You're a sick man. No, you're sick. You have raped a prostitute, not me. - I have it on video. You're sick. - Filip, we are in this together. - Remember what we agreed on. - Where are those recordings, Luc? Here? I want you to destroy all videos, all DVD's. Together with us, ok? Or else I won't give a damn anymore if this mess gets leaked to the police. So you also have the recordings of last night? You know what happened? No, you didn't warn us you'd be here. That was against your own rules. Just like you tend to do more, huh. Breaking your own rules. Now you're scared huh? Scared I have all the videos showing all you did here. You don't have to worry Vince. I'm your friend. Your best friend. I'll be quiet. I'm always quiet. Like a grave. - I knew there was something strange about you. Pervert! - Oh, boy. - You were drooling here over your own friends. - You know nothing of me. Nothing. Zero. Did you see anything? Something that can help us? You know what happened? If people who been hurt, cheated on, if they find eachother. what do you think that happens then? - What do you mean? - What do you think yourself? - What is it, mouse? - I don't want to leave tomorrow. - What? Not in the mood for skiing? - No, but I don't want to go alone. - But you won't be alone, you have the kids. - Yah... You know what I mean. Huh? Can't you come with me after all, honey? I love you. And all the rest is irrelevant. - Why, all the rest is irrelevant? - Everything. Everything that is not important. I'll call you every day. I promise. - I know. One hour. No longer. - No, do as you please. Don't bother with me. Just enjoy every moment we have together. Have you ever thought about what you would lose if you choose for something that you don't know? Oh God, for charity events Mama Concrete may come along. Btw, did you hear anything more about the project on the Left Bank? - I heard the building license is approved. - No, they didn't call back. I'm not important enough for the big boys, eh. But then they don't know me yet. - Ladies... - That's Vincent Stevens, architect. - From that building at the Tavernierkaai. - Oh, that was your work? That's a fantastic design. Beautiful. Congratulations. - MW. Tyberghein: Congratulations. - Thank you Your husband and I even mentioned it, in Dsseldorf. A shame you weren't there. You told me about a project on the Left Bank back there, Mr.. Tyberghein. And you were going to call me. We are working on it. We have submitted a building request and so... - We will see. We hope. Like everybody. - Fantastic. - Are you a gambler, Mr.. mayor? - And you Mr Stevens, you like to take risks? Depends on what there is to win. And what the other has to lose. How did you say that again? Sapienti sat dictum est? Something? Ladies, may I wish you the best of luck in the games. In love you really won't need it anymore, eh. Gentlemen... Make sure you keep some for the alimony, fat one. - Miriam, what are you doing here? - Just blowing off steam, Marnix. I don't have to lock myself up at home. Please, I would love to come back. I made a mistake. I know. I was drunk. - Ok, honey? It didn't mean anything. - It didn't mean anything? I don't get men. If it didn't mean anything, then why did you do it? Must suck for those girls too. - I swear, I'll change. - Change? Into what? A frog? Or into the mussel that you already are? How would you feel if I said I feel like cheating on you tonight? Maybe I already did. With one of your friends. For revenge. With Chris, for example. Or no... With Vincent. Which you sent on his way to talk with me. "Oh, Miriam. He's in such pain. " Oh look, you got lucky. You won. But half of that is mine. Oh, 21. - Did you give Sharon tickets for tonight? - You're hurting me. I so told you to not give her any, and yet you do it behind my back. - So what? Are you her father? - Did you see how she looks? - Looks just like a whore. - I thought you liked those? - What? - Leave her alone. Let her do. She's having fun. And if you'd wanna excuse me, I plan to do the same. I'm winning. You'll 'need it. With all the coke you blaze through your nose. Oh, look who's talking now. Make sure you saved up enough as well. You might need the money sooner than me, you hear me? You know what you can do? Send me the papers to divorce, bitch. divorcing, Filip? And then? As long as we have no children, you won't get anything, fool. Nothing. Here, try the roulette. Perhaps thats a better way to get rich. Ann? Ann? We need to have a word, doctor. - Yes, about what? - Your friend, the architect... He plays's a dangerous game. That's very risky. Could you tell him he should be very careful? I thought this would be about Ann. Excuse us. I don't want you to meet her anymore. - And why should I do that? - I love her. - Then you aren't the only one. - You. .. You pay for her. - I want you to let her go. - Do you realize that she makes that choice. We are just two losers who should be happy with what she gives us. - I've never paid for her. - That's true what you say. - You've never paid for her. At least you didn't. - Alex, quiet. Don't forget to give your friend the message, doctor? What does he mean, "at least you didn't?" - I don't want to love you, Chris. - What does he mean? If he says I didn't pay? Only you can hurt me. Ok? Ann, say it isn't true. Come on. Hey? The first time was paid. Only the first time I was the whore. - All other times you had Ann. - Paid by whom? - Excuse me. Sharon, come with me, now. - Filip, I'm fine. - I want you to come along. - Leave me alone. - Hey, dude. Are you deaf? - Mind your own business. - Sharon, come. - She doesn't want to, idiot. Idiot? Is that written on my forehead, or what? Hey, dude. - Stop it. It's not written there, huh. Fuck. MR. Tyberghein: What happens? - Okay, it's good. Let me go. - Throw him out. Now. I never want to see you again, you hear that, friend? Never. Fool. Who is that girl? Sarah, it's not... It's not what you think it is. What do I think then? This is the sister of a friend of mine. She got harrassed. There was a fight. - Are there others? - Don' be silly. This is the sister of one of my best friends. A child still. Who do you think I am? I'm not sure anymore. I have to keep moving, my wife is here too. - Do you love me? - You know I love you in a special way. - Your special way. What if you'd have to choose? - Sarah, it's not so simple. Let's meet eachother in the loft tomorrow. Barbara will be gone for a week. Then we can talk on in all privacy. Okay? Shall I make it alot easier to choose? How? Let's get straight to the point. What are you gonna do? Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. Oh, excuse me. Did I hurt you? Don't do it. You'll regret it. Jesus. They know. It's them. Our women have framed us. Why, Vincent? Because they found out about the loft. Because they figured it out. Our secret got revealed. Why did you do it? What why? - I'm telling you. - We are friends. We are your friends. It's our women. They found out. Not our women, Vince, but your friends. Your friends found out. Your friends found out. Oh no... Oh... - What's happening to me? - You still don't understand it, huh? Come on, take of his clothes. - What are you doing with me? - Did you really have to leave her like that? Nut. - Shut up, I just did what we agreed on. - O yea? But not like that, with all that blood. That wasn't the deal, Filip. And the Latin. Isn't that overdoing it? Will the cops believe this? - You should have done it yourself then. - Guys, quit it already. - What's happening? - Shut your mouth. - You killed her. - We didn't kill her. We just found her. What? - What? - We've been here before today. In the morning, without you. - Jesus, man. - I thought she was asleep at first. And Vincent knows her? Ofcourse, she even left a farewell note for him. - We should call the police, guys. - What? with suicide the attorney general must be allerted. We're fucked. This is gonna blow up in our faces. "See you in your next life." Can't we find out where she lives and dump here there? Come on, we need to help Vincent, eh. - Hey, he's our friend, come on. - Where is he anyway? This is his fucking problem. - I didn't call him. - How? You didn't call him? Why not, Luc? Guys, I must show you something. You been filming us? Have you gone mad? Beat me up later, we have no time to lose now. I need to show you something, which'll help you understand the situation upstairs better. What do you mean? That we shouldn't pay for the situation Vincent got us into. Vincent has not always been such a good friend. Huh? What is that? What is that? They arrived here late at night, the same night he went to talk with her. She was drunk, Marnix. He took advantage of that. No way. No way. Can't you talk with her? Maybe I already did it. To take revenge. With Vincent. That you sent to talk with me. It's gonna be alright. No, no... Is that your little sister? She got so beautiful, man. - How long is this going? - It doesn't... - How long? - It started after your marriage. They saw eachother regularly. He was the first one for her. He took her virginity. Fuck... Nice, huh? You don't know me. But you're not like that, huh? - The first time was paid. - Paid? Paid by whom? He paid her, to get you into this place. The only ones that can hurt you are the people that you love. He used her. Like he used everyone. I'm gonna destroy him, I swear. - No, I mean it. - Calm down, eh, buddy. If we all stick to the plan we might stand a chance. He can't know what we are up to when he arrives later. - We need to form one block. - It's not like we have a choice. - We 'll all get interrogated by the police. - That's why we should never admit we share the loft. They'll try to put us against eachother, we should never confess. Jesus, you sound just like Vincent. Marnix, if this gets leaked, our lifes end as well. Chris? Okay, I join. On one condition. I want to make sure he was here last night. I want to hear him say it. I'll give a sign. I'll break something. A vase or a glass or something. But... nothing happens untill we are 100% sure. Deal? So. What do we do now? Now we have two hours for alibis and to ensure everything is put in scene. - I'll do that. - No. No, I do it. Really. I'm fine. Go now. Make sure you are seen. - Where is the farewell letter? - I have it. You knew it, eh. All this time. The whole time you watched and didn't tell us. - Voyeur. - Filip. Ain't that so? - You're no better than him. Pervert. - Be glad you know it now. No, Luc, I'm not happy that I know. Swallow, man. What the hell happened here? What the fuck happened here? Is that your little sister? She got so beautifull, man. - How long? - It does not matter... - Did you have to leave her like that? Nut. - Shut up, I just did what we agreed on. Yea? Not like this, with all that blood. That wasn't the deal, Filip. And the Latin. Overdoing it. Will the police still believe this? You put everything in scene. The entire time. A setup. You have framed me. Dirty bastards. My own friends. My own mates, goddamned Why have you done all that, Vincent? Fucking hypocrites. You're all liars and cheaters yourself. Why? For Gods sake, Why, Vincent? Because it was possible, Chris. Because it never ment much. Because I stand above that. I stand above that. - Am I gonna die? - No, Vincent. You will not die. She lured you to this place, she drugged you and then suicided next to you. But you'll survive. Because we are friends. Huh? They framed us. Me and Sarah. Everything is put in scene. - Weird story. - But it's the truth. I would like to believe you, Mr.. Stevens, but what we need are facts. Proof, evidence, facts. The fact is that only your fingerprints were found in the loft. And those of Sarah. They have erased all traces. The fact is that we found traces of sleeping pills and alcohol in your blood, as well as in Sarah's. And then there are the DVD's with your bedroom performances. Impressive collection. Luc made those videos. I knew nothing of it. Nobody. Unfortunately there are only videos of you. Not of anyone else. Not the wife of Marnix, not the sister of Filip. Nobody. - You think we still get away with this? - Filip, why couldn't you just tie her onto the bed. - She was dead anyway. - That's still no reason to mutilate her. She committed suicide. I made it a bit more dramatic. Hopefully your little improvisation wont cause us problems, Filip. Whatever he tells the cops, we keep our mouth shut, ok? We know nothing. Luc is right. That was not necessary. I hope we won't regret this. Interrogate them. Keep putting pressure on them. - Marnix will confess for sure. Luc maybe too. - We have interviewed them. Up till now there's no reason to assume they are lying. And they have one thing that you don't. They have an alibi. - But not for this morning? - Yes. Luc Seynaeve and Chris Van Outryve are seen in a cafe. - Marnix Laureys was at work. - But that can't be. There was at least one hour that we were all together. And Filip, where is he? Filip just reported in with his father in law, Mr Tyberghein. Huh? What is he doing here? He declaired his son in law was with him the entire day. - That's not true, he even arrived late in the loft. - He has a waterproof alibi.. Ofcourse Tyberghein says that. I saw him once with another woman. Filip knew that and also that I put pressure on Tyberghein. Oh, you also blackmailed Tyberghein? They are all against you, huh? All bad guys? When are you gonna stop with those nonsense? Tell us what really happened. Something we all know already. You killed Sarah Delporte. Killed? But, that is not true. I did not kill her! Are you crazy? I did not kill her. Mr. van Outryve, you may go. Thanks for your cooperation. You understand we had to check your friends story. Yes, of course. There is one thing that bothers me, doctor. Why does Vincent blame his friends? I have no idea. I can't understand it either. Could it be he's trying to hide something else? What do you mean? That he killed her? - Your colleague said that it was suicide. - That's how it seems, yes. But according to the autopsy she did not die 'cause of the pills. Her wrist has been cut, but not by her. No hesitation cuts found, doctor. Cuts on the arm, first attempt of someone who wants to cut his wrist. There are non like that on her arm. - Vincent would never do that. - His fingerprints are on the knife. And there was no farewell note found. Is there something, Mr. Van Outryve? Her wrist has been cut, but not by her. His fingerprints are on the knife. And there was no farewell note found. - Where is the farewell letter? - I have it. You freaked me out. Hey, Chris. Is it a good plan to meet here? - Well, I think we have a problem. - Ah. I think we tried to erase our tracks a bit too well. What do you mean? Where is the farewell letter from Sarah? - Didn't you put it in your pocket? - I thought so. But he isn't there anymore. When did you steal it? Just now, when she rang the bell? - The real estate office. - I'm not following. I'm sorry you lost your letter, but I have nothing to do with it. I called that office to check on who put our loft for sale. They were only allowed to give me this number. Yes, I called, yes. - I thought we could... - Say it isn't fucking true. You never called. It's done. It's over. We shouldn't worry anymore. Why did you steal that letter? The only real evidence of her suicide. Is it because perhaps she didn't write it herself? Could it be your handwriting? Vincent cheated us one by one. - Chris, you seen the videos.. - Yeah, I saw them. The videos that made us all so angry we jumped into that plan of yours. What are you doing, Luc? What happened here yesterday? What have you done with that girl? Is it because she stood between you and Vincent? We she in your way? She wasn't in the way, no. She wasn't.. Vincent was blocking my way. Is there anyone else that you love, Luc? Sarah, wait. Sarah. Forget him. Forget Vincent. He's so much better at those games than you. - He hurts you. He uses you. - And you need to tell me that? - Why? - I tell you... I would never hurt you. If you could give me the chance. What do you say now? I would never hurt you. Never. No, Luc, I know that you would never hurt me. And you know why? Because I will never feel anything for you. Do you understand? Never. Maybe in a next life, but not in this. So you were really here tonight? I knew Vincent would see her. Barbara was in France. I'm sorry that it must end like this, Sarah. I waited until he left. She was surprised when she saw me. She was crying. She said I was right about Vincent. Comforting, That's what I'm good for. - You gave her those pills. - Those pills were a distraction. Luc, there is something... What's going on? - Air. I do not feel so good. - It's okay. Luc... I gave her an overdose of insulin. It works immediately and leaves no traces. - Jesus, Luc. - For love, Chris. I've done it because I love her. Loving her hurted so much. Vincent is getting the blame for this. You don't care for that? Vincent... Vincent is an asshole. He used us. It was about time he got used as well. Vincent will pay for murder. Sarah was not dead when we left Filip alone with her. - That can't be. - Yes. - You're lying, Chris. - No. I knew I shouldn't have left Filip alone with her. What he did was sick. Asshole. Sadist! - Sick. - You're sick, Luc. So if I understand correctly, it was your brother who killed her. Go home, Chris. Luc will clean up the mess. As always. You don't need to clean anything anymore. It's over. It's all over. Could you open the window, Chris? - Come on, Chris, come. Hurry. - Come, Luc. Silence. Down. - What are you doing? - Shut up. Will you kill me as well? What do you want me to do, Luc? - You want me to jump? - Come. Stop it, Luc. Ouch! - Jesus. - I don't want to hurt you, Chris. I swear. I called those before you entered, Luc. They are on the way, I told them everything. You're lying. You're bluffing, boy. I know you. I thought I knew you too, Luc. And the letter from Sarah? Is he going down with me? Huh? Give me the letter. Give me the letter, Chris. I wont ask again. No! It's over, Luc. Come, it's over. Everything is over. Come, Luc. Chris, tell Elsie and the children I always loved them. - Do you wanna do that? - Don't do it, Luc. - Do it for Elsie. Please. - No, Luc. Don't do it. Luc! Luc! No, they never met before. Isn't that obvious? - They are together. - Come on. Look at how he looks at her. - They are married. - But that ain't true. - No way, they are secret lovers. - How can you tell? By the way he's trying hard and how she puts her head in his neck. - Those are secret lovers. - You know what they say, persistence pays off. Here, Mr. persistence. Crying like he was, I had to let him back in. Yes. True, cheating isn't the problem.
