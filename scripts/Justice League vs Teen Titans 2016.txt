Reports state that earlier, the Legion launched a surprise attack on the League at the unveiling of their new headquarters, dubbed by many on social media as "The Hall of Justice." - (SNARLING) - (GRUNTING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (WHIRRING) (SCREAMS) Is this any way to treat your guests, Superman? Seeing as how you crashed the party, I'd consider us even. Oh! - (GRUNTING) - (SNARLING) What happened, Toymaster? Did Mama kick you out of the basement? Hmph. (STRAINING) Grundy smash! (ROARING) - (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) - (SCREAMING) (CLATTERING) Grundy sleep now. Robin, report. How's crowd control? (WHOOSHING) (GRUNTS) Huh? Well at hand, Father. As predicted, they respond like contemptible sheep. Surrender, Cheetah. This doesn't have to end in violence. (SNARLING) (GRUNTING) Aah! You're smarter than this, Luthor. Your kind attracts their kind. I'm simply an innocent industrialist caught in the middle. I'll bet. You'll pay for this. Knowing you, it's insured. Huh? Beep, beep. Huh? (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) Not in the face. Whatever you say. (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (YELPING) Playtime's over, Toymaster. TOYMASTER: But I enjoy a good game. And I always win. - (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) - (SCREAMING) (GROANING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) Good work, team. Too bad Shazam and Lantern had to miss the fun. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Slackers. (GROANING) FLASH: We got a runner. Aah! - (GROWLING) - (SCREAMING) Come on, Wizard, don't make me hit you again. Uh, Wiz? (DISTORTED VOICE) Azarath calls, the child must answer. The hour of his rising is at hand. Oh, boy. I've got this. (LOUD BOOM) (GROANS) Hmm. What the hell did he hit me with? Himself, apparently. (ROARING) He's not using any tech. It's magic. Argh! (WIND HOWLING) SUPERMAN: Get them to safety. I'll keep him distracted. (RATTLING) Argh! Argh! (ROARING) Robin, get all civilians inside, do you read me? I have a more efficient way to keep them safe, Father. BATMAN OVER RADIO: Robin? Robin, I gave you a task. Yes, as a human cattle prod. I'm being under-utilized. BATMAN: What's your location? ROBIN: Where I need to be. In the driver's seat. Between the missile and fuel cell detonations, I'd estimate at least a three kiloton hit. (BEEPING) Target locked. Damian, stand down. Too late now. (WHOOSHING) (GRUNTING) (DISTORTED YELLING) WONDER WOMAN: Stand down! (GRUNTING) The lasso compels you to obey my command! (GROANING) What happened? He doesn't know. I thought that would knock the fight out of him. What? We got him, didn't we? What we have is an empty shell with no answers. If you had followed orders and done what you're told, we'd know more. SUPERMAN: Come on, cut him some slack. At least, he was trying to... Not that I disagree. You buried me in a worthless position to keep me out of the way. And I solved the entire problem. This isn't about you. It's about teamwork. All I see is a lot of ineffectual grandstanding. Which is why I prefer to work alone. (SCOFFS) And my dad thinks I'm difficult. Have you ever considered boarding school? I could've driven myself. After the stunt you pulled? You're lucky to be allowed within 10 feet of a steering wheel. (ENGINE REVVING) So, this is my punishment? Enduring a bunch of school children? This is not punishment. Hopefully, you'll learn to be a part of a team. And they're not children. They're teenagers. Worse. Don't tell me Damian Wayne is afraid of a little socializing. I'm not afraid of anything. Teammates are a liability. Really? Then what am I to you? An unavoidable irritation. (GRUNTING) (BLEATING) (ROARING) (ROARS) You were having a nightmare last night. I was just wondering if everything's... Look, I appreciate your concern, I guess. But they're dreams. Just dreams. You know you're naked, right? Huh? Aah! I overslept. Was rushing. Forgot to put on my uniform. Okay? So I sleep in the nude. So what? Animals are naked. I'm the entire animal kingdom crammed into a single magnificent specimen. You're something crammed into something. (PULSATING) What did that thing just say? It was just laughing at you. Yeah, well, butt out, bug. (SNARLING) Yow! Keep that thing on a leash, man! I told you, don't annoy it. STARFIRE: Jaime's right. That scarab is not a pet. It may be fused to Jaime's spine, but it's not exactly under his control. It's like you and your pants. That's why Jaime's here. That's why we're all here. To help each other control our gifts. Help one another become our best selves. Where else are we gonna go? I mean, we're a bunch of freaks, right? Come on, Jaime, we're all family. Like the Three Amigos. Four. STARFIRE: Five. We're getting a visitor. Try not to behead anyone. - Nightwing. - Starfire. It's been awhile. I know. You're looking good. This is Damian. The new Robin. Welcome, Damian. I'll be in my room. - Would you like to... - I think I can manage. That is one creepy mocoso. No, more like sad. Yeah, I was thinking a movie might be nice. Just you and me. No men in tights. That sounds nice. By the way, I bought some new glasses. You might not recognize me. I'm sure I'll be able to pick you out no matter what you're wearing. See you soon. (PHONE BEEPS) (WHOOSHING) Hello? If this is a prank, you're screwing with the wrong guy. (CLANGING) (GRUNTING) Hah! BLUE BEETLE: He hasn't stopped for an hour and a half. (SWORDS CLANGING) Damian, it's time to let others have their turn. (GRUNTS) I'm not finished. Hah! (MACHINE POWERS DOWN) Gee, how'd that happen? (SIZZLING) What the hell? Hmph, I heard your tech was fast. I wanted to see how fast. Don't mess with us, little man. All right. I can see we are getting off on the wrong foot. Damian, this is a team effort. We need to be willing to accommodate others. Nightwing said you were a princess. Exiled, no doubt. Technically, it was a coup. And like it or not, I am the leader of this group. As I see it, you're an alien with nowhere else to go. Everyone needs a home, Damian. You included. Thank you for chiming in, witch girl. We are only here to help you realize your potential. You've been here long enough. When do you think you'll realize yours? Dude, you need to show some respect. - Argh! - (GRUNTING) Oh, no. Ready when you are. No, stop this. Hah! Who's fighting me, you or the bug? You'd better hope it's me. (GRUNTING) (GROWLS) (GASPS) (GROANS) ROBIN: That's the difference between you and me. You wear a weapon. I am a weapon. - (POWERING UP) - BLUE BEETLE: No! Aah! (GRUNTS) Enough! BLUE BEETLE: I tried to stop it. Dios mio. Is he dead? He's still alive. Barely. This is going to be an awkward call to Batman. RAVEN: Everyone get back. By the powers of Azarath, I beseech you. Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos. (GASPS) We need to get her back to her room. Garfield? BEAST BOY: I've got her. (GROANING) What... What happened? Raven healed you. We have to tend to her. Sorry. CYBORG: I knew you'd be here working all night. Thought you might be hungry. BATMAN: No, thanks. Suit yourself. Where does all that food go if you don't have a stomach? You don't wanna know. What are you up to? I've been combing through footage from every camera on the grid. And? There's something odd. Dark spots. They're hard to make out. Activate quadrant pixel enhancement. Show-off. What is that? A shadow? No, the sun direction is wrong. And look here, it's disconnected from the surface. It's mimicking a shadow. It has intelligence. It's wandering, like it's looking for something. Or someone. There's where Weather Wizard ran into it. More like stepped in it. You don't think it was after him. BATMAN: No. I don't. Don't get me wrong, I love catching up on popular culture but the harsh language was entirely unnecessary, and the female lead seemed to only be present in order to be rescued by the leading man. But all in all, I found myself reasonably diverted. Clark? (GASPS) DISTORTED VOICE: Trigon lives. - (GROANS) - Are you all right? Sorry, it's just... I've got a lot on my mind right now. You can always share your burdens with me, Clark. Ugh, stay away from me. (GRUNTING) (YELPS) (SNARLING) Hey! What is wrong with you? (MUFFLED) That is very dangerous. You could put out an eye with that thing. Didn't your mother tell you never to play with knives? RAVEN: By the powers of Azarath, I beseech you. Mother spirit of the nether realm, protect my brothers and sister. And give me strength to face the dark force I fear is coming. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) I suppose I should thank you for healing me. Um, you're welcome. It was strange having you in my head. I felt you prying into my entire life. It was not appreciated. I'm an empath, and if it makes you feel any better, I didn't see it as much as felt it. And I've been trying to shake it off ever since. Then you know I'm not meant to be here at this stupid school. I was groomed for a higher calling. My grandfather's... I know all about your grandfather. I felt him. He was a demon. And believe me, I know my demons. He was a great man. We were going to make the world stronger, better. We were going to rule it together. I know all about that game, too. Now, I don't mean to be rude, but would you mind getting the hell away from me? You know, when you were in my head, I could see things about you, too. - Like what? - It looked like a man. But something more. Who... What was that thing? It was nothing, a nightmare. It was real, I could tell. It's none of your business. Who are you to judge my life? You have other things to fix here. Just stay away from me, okay? BEAST BOY: Steady... Ah. Argh! Can you please do that anywhere else? ROBIN: Jaime? Yeah? Perhaps it was a mistake to challenge you this morning without knowing the full capacity of your alien attachment. I promise you, it won't happen again. Did he just say he's sorry? Aw, see. He likes you. - (THUDDING) - (GRUNTING) DISTORTED VOICE: Trigon lives. (ROARING) (GROWLING) (POLICE SIREN BLARING) Atomic Skull. We had quite a tumble last year. Still, I sensed you, being a good guy and all, playing nice. You won't have to this time. I've gotten a lot, lot, stronger. You don't look so good. (SHOUTING) Okay, okay. - (GROANING) - (YELLING) (TIRES SCREECHING) He's barely alive, Clark, what's wrong with you? He's not himself. What is that? BATMAN: Kryptonite. Guess he doesn't tell you everything. (DISTORTED VOICE) The rising is coming. You cannot stop it. Superman, someone is controlling you. You have your part to play. Both of you. The girl will be taken. Girl? Diana, wait! - We cannot let him... - I've alerted Trevor. With any luck, military satellites are tracking him now. And what will we do? Wait for him to... (SCOFFS) Pull the moon from the sky? No, we'll get... He hasn't said anything about doing something like that, has he? No, but... We're both targets and for all we know, so is the rest of the League. Get back to that island of yours and lock yourself in the darkest, deepest tomb you can find. I'll call. But Clark and I are... You can't expect me to hide. Was worth a shot. - (KEYBOARD CLACKING) - (COMPUTER BEEPING) What are you doing in my room? We have rules, Damian. You never trespass another person's space. You have nothing on her. No background, no history. On who? Raven. You're the leader of this group. You should know everything about her. It's called "vetting." She's 14. No mother, no father. She grew up in a hostile realm, not unlike my own planet. And she escaped, like I did. We didn't know anything about Raven when we took her in except that she needed a home. A place to grow. I was taught that knowledge was power and you knew nothing about her. How much do you have to know when people are in need? Garfield was 11 when his genetics kicked in and gave him green skin and powers. We still don't know the purpose of Jaime's alien armor or all of its abilities. We just knew they needed help. You have to have a little faith sometimes. Faith is belief based on an absence of data. It invites disaster. STARFIRE: You have no idea how frustrating it is. He reminds me of my sister. I told you he was tough. Never had a childhood. Doesn't know how to act with kids or anyone else for that matter. It's affecting everybody. Well, you can't expect him to be great at bonding. Spent most of his life training to kill. Then moves in with the big bad bat, which I can tell you from personal experience, is not exactly fun. So you've told me. (SIGHS) Speaking of fun, the old room looks great. You know, Kori, you and I could just... - (GASPS) Fun. - What? That's it, that's what we need. What who needs? Oh, you're so smart. Thanks, Dick. (STAMMERING) But Kori, I don't... Fun. I wondered when you'd get back. They lost Superman. Fifty-five miles off the coast. Flash is checking the area, he just disappeared. Where the hell is he going? You have my feed from the Batmobile? CYBORG: Yeah. That's messed up. The entity was strong enough to possess a Kryptonian. It can't stay in the host if the host is damaged. If I'd poisoned Superman with a bigger dose, I might have saved him. Scour the net, narrow your search results to Superman sightings and to recent supernatural events. Supernatural? Yes. Subsection: Female. (RUMBLING) Aah! Dude, did you have to bring the sword? Preparedness is a prerequisite for victory. STARFIRE: The gear stays in the car, Damian. Tonight we are to enjoy some mandatory fun. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) This is an opportunity for us to become more familiar with each other. How much more familiar can we get? We've already seen Garfield lick himself. - As a dog? - I wish. - (LAUGHING) - (WHOOPING) Just call me "Eagle Eyes." (SPITS) (GRUNTING) (DINGING) (GIGGLES) What? Huh? (GIGGLES) (GIGGLING) Here, have some. That tastes like pure sugar. Boy, were you up in those mountains a long time. It was a joke, I'm not criticizing. I knew it was a joke. And if you knew me, you wouldn't waste your time trying. I guess neither of our lives are very funny. But I'll tell you something about yourself that not even you know. You may be insufferable, but in your heart, you are a kind and generous soul. (CROWD CHEERING) (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (CHEERING) Booyah! Oh, looks like we found something the bug can't do. Please, please, no autographs. I'm a busy man. (CHUCKLING) Free popcorn to anyone who can slay the beast. I can do it. You know how to dance? I'm a quick study. Hmm, all right. Hope you're a good loser. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) - (BEEPING) - COMPUTER: Dance! (DISTORTED LAUGHTER) Mira. Look at them go. WOMAN: Raven... They're waiting for you. BOY: On the hill, beyond the tent. (HOARSELY) Sister... (GROWLING) He wants you. We've missed you, sister. It can't be him, it's a trick. TRIGON: It is me, child. How? Never leave unfinished what you start. - You fled. - I left. I had you. Yet, here I am. If you were really here, I'd smell your stink. You're still trapped. All you can send are these losers. I will be there. It's our destiny to be together, Raven, always. We're family. You can make that happen. You can bring me. I will fight you every step. - You're an abomination. - Watch your talk, ungrateful girl. Look at yourself. - Weak, lonely. - (GRUNTING) Aligning with chattel. It is beneath my contempt and I will not have it. You will be a part of this, child. You will know the glory of Trigon. Argh! Mother of Azarath, give me strength. You cannot last. You're temporal agents. We will last long enough. Aah! He wants you. He will have you. (GRUNTING) (DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES) (CROWD CHEERING) (PANTING) Awesome, dude. Yes, quite impressive. You were very good too, Garfield. Yeah, okay. (PANTING) Whatever. - (DISTANT SCREAMING) - (ROARING) Ugh! Raven! Titans, go! (GROWLING) (ROARING) They're demonic emissaries. My father sent them. Your father? (STRUGGLING) Damn it. Argh! (GROWLING) (GRUNTS) (BEAST BOY GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (BLADES WHIRRING) Please tell me they're undead. Yes, but you can't stop them like that. They're like batteries. (GROWLING) Then let's run them down. (GRUNTS) Argh! Aah! Argh! - (GROANING) - (BLADES SWISHING) (GRUNTING) Argh! - (GROWLING) - (GRUNTS) (ROARING) (RAVEN GROANS) (STRAINING) (GRUNTING) (ROARING) (TRUMPETING) (GRUNTING) (SCREECHING) (GROANS) (GROANS) Whoo, yeah, we kicked demon boot-ay. Yeah, baby. Up top. Hit me. Hmm. Robin said I didn't know enough about you. I think he was right. You told me you didn't have a father. What I said is that he's gone. That's not the same as dead. He's dead to me. So, why is he trying to kill you? He's not trying to kill me. It's much worse. Safe to say we're not in Kansas anymore. It's no star field I recognize. Where are we? Somewhere my father can't see us. All right, let's hear it. There's so much. I guess it starts with my mom. She was young, rebellious and gullible. Of course she wound up in a cult. Anyway, they decided to do the classic bride of Satan rite. And guess who got to be the lucky bride? I doubt anyone expected it to work, but the ancient ceremony turned out to be the real thing. (WIND WHOOSHING) So, Mom, with her great powers of judgment, didn't hesitate to hook up with the guy who emerged from the smoke. BEAST BOY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. So, your mom did it with Satan? His name is Trigon, but basically, yes. But they totally did it. Garfield? That was inappropriate. Go on. It gets weirder. Mom fled the cult and was on the run with nowhere to go, when she gets saved by these people from another dimension. The people of Azarath. A realm of beauty, peace and tranquility where, needless to say, I did not fit in. And I must have inherited my mom's terrible judgment because I thought if I found out more about the monster who made me, I'd be able to make sense of myself. Raven... Poor Mother, poor Azarath. I became its Trojan horse. He took me to his hellish universe. I could hardly bear the horrors I saw there. Why did Trigon want you? He wanted Earth. He's a conqueror of worlds. But he needs a powerful conduit to open Earth to his control. And you're half human. His way in. But my magic was stronger than he realized. Before he could use me, I was able to trap him inside a crystal. It should've held him. Perhaps if I had stayed there, it would have. But I wanted a home. Why didn't you go back to Azarath? This is Azarath. Don't worry, I'm not staying. I've got to keep moving to keep Trigon off my path. Where will you go? It's better you not know. He's going to try to use you but don't worry, I put a protective spell on you, just in case. And I thought I had a bad burrito. Dude. Guess I should've gotten your permission or whatever. But I couldn't stand for him to corrupt you. You're the only friends I've ever really had. I'll... Miss you. Wait! Leave now and you'll always be running. You have no idea what he's like, Damian. You've never met a monster like Trigon. You beat him once. I was lucky. Now you'll be four times as lucky. If we can't save one of our own, who can we save? I thought you hated us. I'm not wishing you dead anymore. Robin's right, we are your best hope. (LOUD BANG) Down, boy. We heard about the attack. Was she at the center? Her father is an inter-dimensional demon. He was after her. She's coming with us. No, we can handle this. If she's part of this, we need to know. We can protect her. I'm sorry, Raven. We've had two magic attacks and Superman is still missing. - (GASPING) No. - STARFIRE: What's the matter? He knows they're here, he wants them here. Who? If they stay, everything will be lost. This is our job, Father, you have to leave. BOTH: Father? She's coming with us. She stays here. (ROARING) Maybe we should all take a breath. Too late, they're here. Great Hera! Argh! Argh! We're being compromised. - Father! - Get back. (GROANING) - What the hell? - It's a nerve toxin. For Bane. (GROANING) Dude... (SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (DISTORTED VOICE) The Kryptonian has unearthed the infernal shrine, Raven. The who did the what? An ancient shrine built by Satanists. It has magical properties. You are the shrine's final piece. She stays here. You dare challenge us? (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (YELLING) (ROARING) (ROARING) (TRUMPETING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (GROANING) (GASPING) Whoa! Argh! (GROANING) Beetle... (GROANING) (GRUNTING) Ugh! (GRUNTS) I will break her, Raven. (YELPING) I stop my hand for an instant and this one dies, too. Wait! I'll go. As the daughter of your Lord Trigon, I order you to release these feeble humans. (GROANING) (GROANING) Goodbye. (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) Get him inside. Your father awaits. Don't touch me. TRIGON: There had better be no trickery this time, girl, if you want any mercy shown your friends. No tricks. Look, I'm begging you, leave this world alone. And thwart destiny? We were meant to be together. Always. And we shall. (SCREAMING) (GROANING) Think he's back online. Holy crap! - Did that sound demonic to anyone else? - A little. The things it made me see. Cyborg, how do we save Raven? I... I don't think you can. Oh, no. How bad is he? He's been out for 24 hours. He sacrificed himself, risked death to give us a fighting chance at life. Which is more than I can say for the rest of the League. Damian, this isn't the time to squabble. We have to get Raven back. We don't even know where she is. She's in the Middle East, 60 miles north of Kahndaq City. - How do you... - I put a tracer on her. - When? - About 30 seconds after we met. Same time I put one on each of you. What? Cyborg, you have the ability to manifest boom tubes, do you not? Yeah, I can boom us there. But you guys barely held your own against Flash and Wonder Woman, and that's without Superman being on deck. ROBIN: He shouldn't be a problem. Yeah, right, like you got a way to take out Superman. Oh, my God, I think he does. You heard the plan. Titans, go! (SCREAMS) (GROANING) (GROWLING) (BOTH GROANING) (GROANS) You mind removing that? (GRUNTS) What? Damian. Starfire. You okayed this? Yes. Good call. It's okay, it's healing. (DISTANT SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) I've got Flash, the rest of you get Raven off that thing. (NEIGHING) (GRUNTS) Aah! Argh! Barry, if you can hear me in there, sorry. (GRUNTS) (MOANING) (GRUNTS) Ow. How long will it take you to heal? Ah, oh, my God, an hour? Also, seriously? You've got 10 minutes. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) Your power is no match for that of Trigon, Kryptonian. She doesn't belong to you, devil. (SHRIEKING) Let me go, you alien filth. (STRUGGLING) You sicken me. I never cared. I never loved you. Who are you? I am corruption incarnate, you piece of... (GROANING) The lasso commands you answer. Argh! I... I... Argh! I am Diana of Themyscira. Argh! (EXHALES) It's okay. I've got you now. Mmm... Just like in the movies. (GASPING) (GRUNTING) (SIGHING) (WHINNIES) You can get off my back now, Boy Bony-ass. (SIGHS) - You all right? - (RAVEN GROANS) (RUMBLING) Nothing is right. STARFIRE: Run! Everyone, run! (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (HISSES) (GROWLING) Well, this sucks. Great Hera. (SLAMS) (WIND WHOOSHES) (RUMBLING) He'll bring hell on Earth. How do we stop him? - There's only one way. - You're going to put him back in the crystal. In the unlikely event that I can make it there. He's heading for the city. CYBORG: Superman, Raven has a plan. The Titans need my help. I'm going to hell. (ENERGY PULSATING) BEAST BOY: Oh, I don't feel so good. The crystal can only be touched by me. He may have escaped it, but he can't destroy it. I just hope he left a trail of breadcrumbs. RAVEN: Home, sweet home. Can't you just transport us inside? No, it's shielded. (WHOOSHING) - (WONDER WOMAN GRUNTS) - (SLAMS) (WHOOSHING) Maybe this will slow you down. Ugh... (ENERGY PULSATING) (DISTANT SHRIEKING) (SHRIEKING) (ENERGY PULSATING) (PANTING) Garfield! (BONES CRUNCHING) (GASPS) Dude, what the hell? (SHRIEKING) (GRUNTS) (GROANS) (STARFIRE GRUNTS) (GROANING) (GRUNTS) - (SHRIEKS) - (GASPS) - (GROANING) - (BONES CRUNCHING) - (GROWLS) - (GRUNTS) - (ROARS) - (THUDS) (GRUNTING) Gar, you still with us? (PANTING) (GROWLING) (LAUGHS) (GRUNTS) (WHOOSHES) (ENERGY CHARGING) - (GRUNTS) - (SLAM ECHOES) (STRUGGLING) Little help! (SCREAMING) (FLASH GRUNTS) - If we cannot stop this creature... - I know. (GROANS) - (GRUNTING) - (SWORD CLANGS) (BEAST BOY GRUNTS) (CHITTERING) Argh! (GRUNTS) (SNICKERS) HOARSE VOICE: Welcome home, sister. (GROWLING) It's the freak show again. (GROANING) (BONES CRUNCHING) (BONES CRUNCHING) (BONE SNAPS) (ROARING) (ROARS) (PINCERS CLANKING) (GROWLS) Get inside! (AIR WHOOSHING) (ENERGY PULSATING) (RUMBLING) (POWERING UP) (GROANING) (ROARING) (YELLS) Dude! (RUMBLING) (SWISHING) (SHATTERING) (GROANING) Grandfather? Damian, my blood. It's a trick. I saw you die. No trick. It's me. I assure you. I exist. Lord Trigon is my sustenance. - He's a devil. - No. He's a god of necessity. How do you think I attained my power? Where do you think the Lazarus Pits came from? It's all his doing, and he can make things whole again for a price. He can give us the world we wanted. You and I. A perfect world. She's the only one who stands in the way. Prove your love, Grandson. Take care of this for me. Before my pact with Trigon expires. I... I would do anything to bring you back, but, Grandfather, I don't... You hesitate. Why? Are you afraid to do the one act that will restore me to life? I'm not afraid of anything. You dare disobey me? Have you forgotten your heritage? You are an al Ghul. No, I'm a Titan. (GRUNTING) TRIGON: Stupid girl. You think your allies can stop me now that I'm here? The Justice League, defenders of this realm, less than insects to me. I will strip bare the flesh from their bones. And your pathetic friends, I will make them suffer endlessly, and you will have to watch. Soon, your souls will belong to Trigon, as will your world. (ROBIN GRUNTS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANS) (SHOUTS) Your friends have made you soft. Ungrateful child. You could have been immortal, like me. (GRUNTS) TRIGON: Give up. You're too weak to stop me, Raven. You always have been. Just like your mother. RAVEN: No, my only weakness was loving you, hoping I'd be loved in return. But all you were capable of giving is pain, so I ran away and found friends, friends I would give my life for, friends who give me love and the strength to do this. (CHANTING) - (GROANING) - (SWORD CLANKS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) - (RUMBLING) - (GROANS) (GROWLING) (SHOUTING) Damian, save me! (SCREAMING) - (SWORD SWISHES) - (GRUNTS) (RUMBLING) Grant me the strength of mighty Azarath to contain the demon Trigon within this sacred shard, now and forever. (RUMBLING) Huh? (SCREECHING) (SHOUTS) (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (SHRIEKING) (GROANS) STARFIRE: Raven! Is it over? It'll never be over. Trigon will spend every single minute trying to get out of here, so he needs to be watched every single minute. Dude, thanks for helping out. It was nice to have a big gun around. Yeah, you ought to dump those stuck-up jerks and sign up with us. It was nice not to be the kid for once, but when you've been in the majors... You know what I'm saying. (BEAST BOY FARTS) Time to go home. I'll take you back. Unfortunately, this is my home. I have to watch him. It's not your home. Home is the place where... When you have to go there, they have to take you in. Robert Frost. You are full of surprises, Damian. You're coming with us. BATMAN OVER COMPUTER: I've sifted through all the data and found no signs of the corruptors for the 10 days since our encounter with Trigon. In other words, great work, Titans.
