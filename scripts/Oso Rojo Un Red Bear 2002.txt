Where are you going? Where are you going, Rubn? It's cool. I'll be back soon. Where do you have to go? Stay to eat cake. Freeze! Don't move! Give me the gun! - Where is the girl? - I left her in the kindergarten. What is it? No, it's nothing. I brought you the... I brought you the picture. Wow, look! What's going on? Your ring? Where is your ring? Show me your ring! Bastard! You slut! Don't hit him! Slut! Slut! Come with me. Don't touch me! A RED BEAR Looking for someone? Gimp's bar...? He moved to Caboto Street at La Boca. Do you know Gimp? Yes. Looks like he cut a deal with the mayor and moved over there. Can you spare some change to buy beer? Thanks. - Hi. - Hello. - What will it be? - I'm looking for Turco. He's not in. - Who's asking? - Come in. Stack it in the back, we'll sort it out. How are you? You know we don't admit faggots in this place. How are you? It's been a long time. I always ask Uruguayo about you. What is it? Have you forgotten Uruguayo? No, I haven't. I also asked Felpa. I saw him a couple of weeks ago and he knew nothing. Bring us two beers. Let's take a seat. Good to see you. - When did you get out? - Today. And you came here. What else could you do? Where could you go? - How's your brother? - He's fine, he went to Uruguay. He'll be alright. He's smart. You must be looking for a job, right? I'll tell you what. I'll talk to Chino. I want my money. You didn't give it to Natalia, neither to my brother. I didn't give it to your brother because I didn't see him... you tell me he's gone to Uruguay. I didn't give it to Natalia, she left with the guy, you know. Give it to me now. Turco, Carbajal wants to talk to you. Tell him I'm not in. Ask him to leave a message. Give me a phone number and I'll call you next week. Give me yours. Give me paper and pen. - Here. Call me next week. - I'll call you tomorrow. This one is more expensive, but it's better. It's not as big as the other one. Look at the drum. - How much is it? - 52. I'll take this one. - I'll wrap it for you. - No. You'll take it without the packaging? Yes. It's off. You have to stick it in here. You can move it but you can't touch it... and this one you may touch but you can't move it. Let's go for a ride. My mum won't let me ride around the block. Come on. Wait! Wait!! Alicia, come on, sweetheart. Come in and do your homework. Leave your bike, go in. How are you? Fine. And you? I'm well. - Good morning. - Good morning. - When did you get out? - Today. Rubn, you know I... - I'm still... - Yes, my brother told me. - His name is Sergio, right? - That's right. - Mum, it'll get late! - She has to go to school? No, she goes to school in the morning. She's got gym now. - She's in third grade? - Second. She repeated a year. She's got problems reading. Here. Give her this for me. - Thanks. - I'll come see her this week. I can't stay now, I have work to do. - We have to talk. - Talk about what? About the papers. Talk. But you can see her, for the time being. I have to go in. Good luck, I mean with your work. - Bye. - Bye. Yes. Uruguay. About 16 pesos. Alright, bye. Ramiro, you go. It's downtown. Here. - I have to fill up with gas. - Alright, hurry up. What do you want? I'm looking for a grocery store, but I have this address. - Who are you looking for? - Wense. I bring this from Cuervo. Give me that. He's out and doesn't dare to come? He's not out. - Can you drive? - Yes. You can stay here tonight. I'll give you something tomorrow and you can get a room. I'll get a room today. Are you ready? He paid. Yes, cash. No, it's a down payment and the balance later this month. - Alright, I'll see you. - Hello, is Horacio in? His brother. Turco, this is Bear speaking. Do you have the money? The money, Turco. No, I don't want 50 pesos. Next week. I want all of it. No, I'll call you tomorrow. Pal, can you spare 10 pesos? Ten pesos? You can't ask for 10 pesos. No, get a job. - Stop it! Stop it! - Don't you look at me. I'll kill you! Where's your money? I have no money! - Where's the money? Come on! - In my pant pocket. The other pocket. Here. - Don't hurt me. - Why are you crying? You crying for that chick? She's horrible. Don't cry for a chick. Turn around and I kill you, motherfucker! The only room I have is Wait a second, I'll show you the room. - What do you think? - It's alright. - You come alone, right? - Yes. No problem. Let me tell you. Visits in the room from 2PM to 4PM only. Wasn't he going to come? Please, Sergio! We talked about this. If I hadn't told you it would have been worse. And he's the father, he's got the right to see the girl. But we can't have him here every day. - This is not his home. - Not his home... Of course it's not. He was here two days ago and hasn't returned. Let's drop it, for the girl. But let me tell you... if I see him here, I'll end up in the slammer. Alicia, brush your teeth and comb your hair, we're leaving. Do me a favor. When you come back buy something for dinner. I'm going to San Martn, there's an ad for laborers. I'll try and do it on my way back. Here. It's alright. I'll ask him to put it on our tab. No, he said we must pay before getting any more credit. What are you doing, Ali? A game that Vero taught me but I can't do it. This one you have to stick between the two. This one you may touch but you can't move... and this one you may move but you can't touch. Vero says it's easy. Let me see. It can't be done. Tell Vero she lied to you. Bye, princess. Bye. Let me see... the book. What's that, Alicia? Look at me, Alicia. Only for today. Hello. What are you doing here? I came to see Alicia. Rubn, we said you would let me know. Where would I get in touch with you? Let's go to school. It's late. I'll drive you there. La Nueva del Carril, cars with drivers. Her teacher said she has to practice. Read more, apart from school. Minimum fare, two pesos. You are Del Carril? - No, Del Carril is where I work. - And whose is the car? It belongs to the owner of the company. - And he lets you use it? - Sort of. He lets you use it or you stole it? Alicia, what are you saying?! Don't worry. Bye. Alicia! Come and say goodbye. Bye. Here, come. - Buy something, some candy. - Thanks. Bye. - Well... - I'll drive you. - I'm not going home. - Never mind, I'll drive you. It's only a few blocks. - It's too hot to walk. - OK, thanks. Are you working? Yes... a couple of days a week, in the morning. As a maid. Next corner, the white house. - That one? - Yes. Wait. Here's the phone of this place where I'm working. And I'll write down the phone number... and the address of my hotel. Bye. Thanks. I'll go to see the girl the day after tomorrow. Alright. Toto, take Chino a beer over there. Turco, somebody wants to see you. Hello, how are you? I thought you'd call before coming. I see you got a job. A car and everything, well done, pal. A beer, nice and cold. - How is your family doing? - They are fine. That's important. What about the money? I told you it's not easy to gather four grand. I want my money, Turco. - Cheers, boys. - Cheers, Turco. It's sad being in prison, not seeing your family. You just got out, the cops come every night to play pool. Let's not get carried away for four lousy grand. You think I want to screw you, Bear. I'm hard up for money. I have something big coming up. We are not talking four grand. It's more like five grand. And there's no risk for you. You and your car. I guess you don't plan on being a driver the rest of your life. I don't think so, Oso. If you plan to support your family with 600... unless your wife has another guy. As soon as this falls through I'll give you your money. Send my love to your family, I know they live in San Justo. Be careful, that district sucks... there are always shootings there, like in the far west. - Cheers, boys. - Cheers, Turco. - Who is it? - Alicia? - Who is it? - It's me. - Hello. - Mum's not back yet. I know, she said she'd be here at midday. Yes, but she's not back. She told me not to let anyone in. Besides, how do I know you are my father? See? This is you, your mum, and me. Mum told me I shouldn't let strangers in. But she said nothing about you. Come in. Take a seat. Thanks. You have a lot of homework? - Is that difficult? - More or less. Did it hurt when they did that on your arm? No. That comes off with water? It doesn't come off with anything. Never. My mum and Sergio also had a car... but they had to sell it because he lost his job. What are you doing here, Rubn? What are you doing here? I let him in because it was raining. You could have waited in the car. You know I don't live alone. Go before Sergio arrives, please! I'm leaving. I came to see Alicia... I brought you this. - What is it? - A story book, so you can read. - Does it have pictures? - Yes, it has pictures. I thought I'd take her out for pizza. Put your boots on, it's raining. - Do you want to join us? - No, I've got things to do. No, wait. Thanks. Why did you repeat grades? Because I didn't like the teacher. The one I have this year is much better. She's called Araceli. On Monday we are having an act for May 25th. She told me I'll be escorting the flag. - Do you have a girlfriend? - No, I don't have a girlfriend. Is it true that you killed a policeman? No. I couldn't do something like that. That's wrong. - You are going back to jail? - No. Never again? Never again. - What are you doing? - A game a friend taught me. - Sergio says it can't be done. - How is it? You have to place this one between the other two. You can touch this one but you can't move it. You can move this one, but you can't touch it. Let's see... I can touch this one, but can't move it. I can move this one, but can't touch it. Yes? I can do as I please with this one? "So the snakes organized a party and invited frogs and toads... flamingos and crocodiles... and fish. As fish can't walk... " Alicia! It's too late for you to be reading. You must go to sleep, you get up early. I'm not sleepy. Never mind, you go to bed and you sleep. You told me if I didn't read I would repeat grades again. Not at this time. You don't read at night, you read during the day. Let's see. Where were you? Here, where it says: "I know what we'll do. " I'll read till you fall asleep... and then tomorrow you continue reading, OK? "I know what we'll do, said a flamingo. Let's wear red and black socks... and coral snakes will fall in love with us. My in-law, the owl, has that kind of socks... said the tat, who wanted to give flamingos a hard time. By all means, said the owl and returned with the socks, but they weren't really socks but coral snake skins. Beautiful skins just ripped from the snakes which the owl had hunted. Don't you worry about a thing, said the owl... Just keep one thing in mind. You must dance all night long. Dance without ever stopping, because if you stop... instead of dancing you'll be crying. The flamingos, thrilled and happy... put the skins on as socks and merrily flew to the party. When they saw the flamingos with the beautiful socks... everybody was envious of them. The snakes would only want to dance with them. And as the flamingos never stopped moving their legs... they couldn't see what the beautiful socks were made of. " It was about time. - How is it going? - Fine. Let's see... Catch you later. I'm not stupid, I read the newspaper. Yesterday Carilinda won. I'm not asking you to give me credit. Alright, but Quique told me to put it on your tab. My tab? Yes, to take it from what you owe us. Miguel... you can't do this to me. Go talk to Quique, he's sitting there. Coffee. And croissants. I tell you what... put it on my tab and I'll bet on other horses. Bets are cash only. - What? - You can't bet on credit. What's going on? What is it? Miguel says I can't bet. Of course you can, what you don't have is credit. You owe too much. It doesn't look like you are going to pay. You know what? You must get a job, nice and quiet. Then you come here and pay. I'm in no hurry. It's 8AM, you are the only one who comes to bet at this hour. You can't cut me off. Give me something, you know I'm looking for a job... I have a family, the girl. And I'm your number one client here. You could treat me better. You, number one client? With clients like you I'd be broke. You owe me too much money, it's over one grand. - Beat it. - What? Next time around, bring money. - You fucked up. - What? You fucked up. None of your business, motherfucker! Why, "motherfucker"? If my daughter gets in trouble because of you, I'll kill you. Alright? Why should you tell me this? I'm not interfering with you, your daughter, your seeing her. - What is it? - You are such a nice guy. I want no trouble. If you are upset because you just left prison... I don't want to keep you away from your daughter. Your daughter might be with me, but she's your daughter. What is it, asshole, you are a psychologist now? If you are going to fuck up, better beat it! Beat it! Alicia! Do you want to ride the merry-go-round? Alright. Let's go. Now yes. That girl is alone... ...well, that's her dad... but he has just come out of jail. - Who did you come with? - My daughter. Who is your daughter? She is my daughter. Here... I don't want to see you again. Do I make myself clear? - Hi. - Hello. Give him the keys, Bear. - You went to see your daughter? - Yes. - How is she? - She's OK. How did you find her after all this time? She's fine. Pretty. Look after her. If you need me I'm outside. He had a beautiful granddaughter. He would bring her to ride in the car with him. And then one day his son got into bad companies. He'd been in and out of jail several times. He made good money, his son. He was called Ral, I think. And I don't ask much. Then his son bought his girl a bicycle and took her to the park. He was confronted by the cops who hate him. They say they didn't see the girl, they only saw the guy. But she got riddled with bullets alright. His daughter-in-law never forgave him. She won't let him see the other child. And he doesn't want to see him either. Sometimes, if you love somebody the best is to keep away. Yes? The lady wants to see you. Keep it short, we are outside visiting hours. Alright. What is it? - What is it? - You ask me what is it? The thing is you never change. You can't go around hitting people just out of jail. - Don't shout. - I'm not shouting! I don't understand what you are after. Did I keep you from seeing her? Did I ask you to see the judge? - No. - Then, keep out of my way. Why do you get involved with Sergio? Who do you think worked to feed your daughter... to dress her, to send her to school?! You know nothing. - What is it I don't know? - Nothing at all. That Sergio bets on horses? - That's not your business. - My daughter is my business. Your daughter never lacked anything. And she never will lack anything, I'll see to it. If you want to help her, do so, but stay out of my way. Here, if this is what you want for her presents, keep them. And if you want to see her, get a lawyer. Now we are being evicted... I can't pay the bills, the grocer won't give us credit... the girl's school... - Come. - Leave me. Leave me alone. Please. - Is it open outside? - Yes. - Is it cold? - Freezing. - Have a glass. - Thanks. You faggots! What are you staring at, faggot? Faggot, faggot, faggot and faggot. You are all faggots and you are the king of all faggots. You know why? Because you are a faggot and a sharpie. Now you'll have your faggot friends here... beat me up, you bastard. - Do you know why I don't report you? - Why? Because I'm not a snitch. Come back with the money, I don't want to see you. Come. Bastard! Give me a rag. Give me a rag! Asshole... didn't your dad tell you not to hit drunkards? Who are you? I'm the one who's going to set you straight, dickhead. Straight? Come on. How much does he owe you? How much does he owe you?! About a grand... 1,200... Next week he'll come to pay. Next time you let him in I'll come and get you. Let's go. We are not giving any more credit, alright? Is that clear? Fuck! Faggots! Son of a bitch! You take advantage because I'm drunk. Get cleaned. - I'm getting off. - Cut it out! You wanted your family? There's your family. You want money? I haven't got a cent. Forget about the other day. - What are you saying? - What am I saying? You are a whistle-blower. Natalia went to see you? So Natalia goes to see you and I'm the whistle-blower. What's wrong with you? Can't you see she knew everything before I told her? Besides, that's between she and I. We discuss because of the eviction. I told her to go and live with her sister, I'm splitting. I want no more of this shit, it's a mess. Everything's fucked up. And then I see these bastards, ask them to give me a hand... I tell them I'm all in, and the bastards screwed me. Fuck them! Get out. To tell you the truth, I don't understand you. People need to be taken care of, that's easy to understand. It's easy, you only have to drive. That's all. To be split in five? We must give something to the security guard there. It's like 1,000 salaries. And we are not talking - I can get a car, but not a gun. - Don't worry about that. - You just do the driving. - You keep a part? Of course, the one planning the play also collects... not only the one kicking the ball into the goal. We have to keep away from this district, that's important. And when I get the dough, I'll pay what I owe you, everything. Then you can pay a good lawyer... for that business with your daughter. But it's got to be tomorrow, or we'll have to wait until next Friday. - I told you I can't get a gun. - Alfarito will bring you one. But, like I say, don't worry. How come you decided to do this all of a sudden? - Go to sleep, Alicia. - I'm coming. Now, otherwise you won't wake up tomorrow. - Where's the book? - What book? I put it away. - We are not reading today? - Alicia, go to bed. It's easy, boys. I don't do it myself because of my arthritis, whatever. All cash, all of it. You have five minutes. In, hit and out. He'll drive a blue car. Don't even think of coming back here. - Bear will carry a gun? - Yes, otherwise, he won't do it. - He can fuck up the job. - How could he? There's three of you, all carrying good guns. He is alone, and only has a handgun. Boys, if you do it right, we can split his part too. I have a job. - All of a sudden? - Yes. - Alicia is OK? - Yes, she's fine. You've been out only a month. You'll do this alone? It's properly calibrated, it never failed me. I don't want it. If you use my car you'll get me in trouble. Cops, an investigation and all the rest. I'll get a car. I want to thank the parents who have joined us today... to share this moment. Let's welcome the flag. We want to remember today our men of the past... those who believed in the possibility of freedom. We will now sing our national anthem. Listen to the sacred cry... Pal, this is not the blue car you had. - It broke down, give me the gun. - ... freedom, freedom. Listen to the sound of broken chains... watch the throne of Equality. And the throne was opened... to the United Provinces of the South. And the free men of the world reply: Salvation to the great Argentine people. Salvation to the great Argentine people. And the free men of the world reply: Salvation to the great Argentine people. To the floor! Shut up, goddamit! Shut up! May the laurels we achieved last for ever. ...we achieved. Let's live in glory. Let's swear to die with glory. - How are you? - Hello, Esther. How are you? - What about Sergio? - He stayed home, he's packing. You are leaving today? Yes, the moving truck is coming this afternoon. - You are going far from here? - Yes, no, to my sister's. - Hello, sweetheart. - Hello, pumpkin. - Well done, Ali. - Where's dad? I don't know, let's go. Motherfucking Gimp! Why didn't he tell us there were three guards with the truck? - He did tell us. - When? I heard nothing. - He did tell us. - Am I stupid or what? Of course he told us. Are you deaf? He said nothing, dickhead! We have to get rid of the car. Here, make a left, I mean, make a right. I have a message from Turco: Fuck you! Son of a bitch! What time did they say? The thing is, Alberto will be waiting. I'll call him in five minutes. Why not call now? I don't want to leave. Come on. Come, give me a kiss. Go call now. - Is the payphone working? - Yes. Or you can ask Esther to let you use hers. What is it now? Holy shit! - What's this? - Pay all your debts. Where did you get this? None of your business. I don't want to get in trouble. I don't want stolen money. Cut it out and take it. All money is stolen. Here, give this to my daughter. Send her my love. We are not leaving? No, it's too much trouble. We'll stay. Why did my dad leave? He won't take me to school tomorrow? Yes... he'll take you if possible. He's your dad, right? Turco, buy us a beer. I spend too much on you. Come on, pal. You buy today, I'll buy tomorrow. That's not the way it is any longer. Get him another beer. Turco, Bear's here. What happened? Where are Tuerto and Alfarito? We split because the cops showed up. The cops didn't follow you? - Everything went well? - Fine. Bastard! You bastard! "... and then in the end... seeing that there was not a shred of sock left... the snakes let them go... tired and arranging their dancing gowns. Sometimes they leave the water and walk a few steps ashore... to see how they are doing... but the pain of the poison returns... and they run to the water. Sometimes the pain is such... that they pull up a leg and remain thus for hours... because they can't straighten it. This is the story of flamingos who used to have white legs and now have red legs. " That's it. A RED BEAR
