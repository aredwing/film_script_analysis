Theories on our emotional development are divided into tWo schools of thought-- Whether We're products of genetics predisposed to exhibit certain behavioral patterns, or products of our environment. Evolutionary biologists believe that our inherited genes are What determine development. Opponents argue that our individuality is directly influenced by the patterns of behavior that We see and hear every day. In other Words, a child raised in a loving environment Will respond to the World in a much different Way than a child raised in fear or taught to hate. Our children are in essence mirror images of ourselves-- our beliefs, our ideologies, our conscience-- ground control to Major Tom-- Which brings us to psychotherapy-- the psychoanalytic theory of personality. This Will be on the test, people. Hey, need a ride? Uh, I don't knoW. Come on, get in. Take a break. Have some fun. Are you starting your oWn pharmacy? I get headaches. I can't stay out late. Don't Worry. I'll have you back by Monday. Yeah, I restored it piece by piece. I thought about opening my oWn body shop one day, but... Why don't you? Um, Well, my dad-- he's not so good on his oWn. So hoW far do you run anyWay? Five, six miles. I would have a heart attack. Yeah. These Will give you a heart attack. I guess you never eat junk like this, huh? I'm not in training right noW. Yeah, me neither. So do you have any brothers or sisters? Just me and my dad. My mom died a couple of years ago-- pneumonia. Has he alWays been, um--? Yeah, he used to Work construction. He lost the use of his legs in an accident in Chicago, actually. My father alWays Wanted a boy. He was a track star and just missed qualifying for the Olympics in '76. He tried to correct that failure through me. They Were driving home from dinner just a mile from the house and... an bleW a stop sign. It's funny hoW everything can change in an instant. A stranger can come along and in the blink of an eye just destroy everything. So you came to live With your uncle? I have a grandmother Who lives in NeW York, but she's agoraphobic, a real freak shoW, so... it Was her or my uncle. I bet you Wish you Went to NeW York noW, huh? I hate New York.

Do you Want to live in the back of a truck? Do you Want to collect Welfare? You think I Wanted to come here? You think I Wanted to come and live With you? My brother and l made a promise a long time ago: Should something happen to either of us, We'd be there for each other's kids. It's not one you ever expect to have to keep, and I'm not going back on my Word, but it's your life. You Want to try it out on your oWn, go ahead. You Want me to get out? I Want you to make a choice. Okay, Well, We'll do things my Way for a While, just as long as We understand each other. Oh no. No. I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything. Please. Graham: Like I shoWed you.

I'm not afraid of you anymore. This is my house. I'm not gonna be like you-- condemned. I'm fixing What you broke! Go back to hell Where your bed is made. This is my house! - My dad trusted me. - Jonathan Will too. You just have to give him a chance. Besides, it's not you he doesn't trust. I can take care of myself. I knoW you can. He's just trying to look out for you. Please. What's he got against William anyWay? Oh, We've knoWn Billy since he Was this high. He's had to deal With more than his share of problems. That's not his fault. I mean, I think it's Wonderful hoW he takes care of his father, especially after What happened to his mother. Well, she did that to herself. You can't give yourself pneumonia. She didn't die of pneumonia. Billy's mother-- she killed herself. What? Hung herself in the garage. Billy Was the one Who found her. It Was really hard on him. The doctors put him on all sorts of medication. He's gotten in a lot of trouble around toWn. I think Jonathan's just afraid he's a little unstable. And hisfather--well-- Where are you going? I need to sort things out in my head. Hey, Allison, you Want to play a game? Maybe later, okay? Where are you going? Hello? No, Wait. Hello? Hey, are you okay? Wait. Are you okay? Are you in trouble?

You can't stay here. It's not safe. What's Wrong? You don't have to be afraid. You can trust me. You shouldn't be doWn here. No! No! No! No! No! Good Work. - I'm sure she's fine. - How? She's just bloWing off some steam. No 17-year-old Wants to be told What to do. Not yet. I don't have any brothers or sisters 'cause Dad's lazy. And noW he's chased her aWay too. Way to go, Dad. She never came home last night. I know. Where are you going? I'm gonna go find her. I need to speak to Allison. She's not here. It's important. - She isn't here, Billy. - We thought she Was With you. No. She's been gone all night? Since yesterday. This is your goddamn fault. - Stop. Jonathan. - Stay the hell aWay from her. - Jonathan. - Don't push me. - Jonathan. - You're no good.

You're no better than he Was! You promised me. I did everything you said. You Win. You're Wrong. He wouldn't dare. Don't look at me like that. You don't ask Why. You just do. That's just the Way it is. You think you oWe me, think maybe I should groW eyes in the back of my head? They abandoned you. What Would you be Without me? You feel guilty or something?

With each one another sin is forgiven. I can't let it happen again, not like me. You understand, don't you? Not like that boy-- Worthless. Karen! Karen. Don't let him get her. I can't stop now. There's still so much more to do. You-- you come With me. Come With me. Please come with me. Help me. Help me redeem myself! - No. - Let her go, you son of a bitch! It does. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's me. It's just me, okay? Where is Mommy? She's doWnstairs. I need you to stay here, all right? Why? Just please do as I say. - Okay? - Don't leave. I'm not leaving. Just stay here. Martin! Martin! 911. What is your emergency? Yes, hello? Wendy: Allison? Boy! I understand now Why they run... that even a dumb animal knoWs When it's been betrayed. Do you feel betrayed? No. That's Why you didn't run. 'Cause you kneW you had it coming. You-- you never ran. My boy. Thank you. We counted four bodies. Any idea What caused it?
