Well, some say they're the dead people who can't leave those who are still alive, and they stay behind in this world. Some say, ghosts are the imagination of those who are alive, refusing to believe their loved ones are dead. Dad, do you believe in ghosts? Police. There's an accident on Highway 3 at the Cheung Sha Wan Exit. Yes, 2 adults and 2 kids. Call an ambulance, now! Dad... Dad Dad That day was November 11,1998, I went blind. Dad could no longer tell me whether there're ghosts in this world. He's dead. Dad has been dead for a year, Mom still agonizes over it. She can't sleep at night, playing Dad's favorite song at the piano, but only gets half way through every time. Mom, don't cry... I miss your Dad so much. Why doesn't he come back? What could I've done at this age? I wish there were ghosts, and Mom could see Dad. Time flies and a decade has passed. I'm in college studying literature hoping to become a writer. Mom has gone back to college, taking one subject after another. Dad, I won a championship again. Honey, I've graduated. Mom has got another PhD, so great! Mom, don't cry. I still miss your Dad a lot. Time has healed nothing. I'm not a kid any more and I've got to help Mom. Mom. Sorry, Mom can't sleep. Mom, I want to write a novel, about us. The world in the novel would be the exact opposite of the real world. Dad didn't die but went blind, we would be dead. And there would be ghosts in that world. We would make Dad... live again in the other world. In that accident, Dad has gone blind. but we were killed. Dad missed us so much that he wished ghosts were real. Dad is blind and by himself, I want a Philippines maid to take care of him. Maria will take care of Dad just like Mom. Maria is not that pretty. Maria is not pretty and she is scared of ghosts. Get a puppy to accompany Dad. Oscar has turned into a puppy to stay with Dad. Mom's coming back soon to cook for Dad. A novel can fulfill the dreams of the readers. And the writer can come to terms with her own pain. I hope to write a novel and heal Mom's pain, and help reunite her with Dad. Police. There's an accident on Highway 3 at the Cheung Sha Wan Exit. Yes... 2 adults and 2 kids. Call an ambulance, now! That day was November 11 1998. I can't hear from wife and kids, and can't give Melody the answer. Do I believe there're ghosts? Cos they're dead. Time flies and a year has passed. Maria is the Philippines maid that takes care of me. The place I visit most frequent is the cemetery. I wish there were ghost in this world, my wife and children will look for me. Maria, what if it was me who died? I don't know, sir. Maria, who decides who will die? I really don't know, sir. Maria, can you see Mom? No... It's getting late, let's go. I'm scared. Tell me when you see them, Maria. Maria, I want to write a novel where anything could happen. There would be ghosts. And madam, Melody and Oscar would all come back. Our family would be back together. Stove on, ventilator spinning, lights on. My wife is back. Man and ghost are just A hand of fate will toss it, and the sides keep flipping. Heads and tails are always on opposite sides. Man and ghost are on different paths. And the pain lasts into eternity. Why are you cooking so late? Sir, what're you cooking so late at night? Sir, your favorite dish. Oh, a ghost did that. Your dead wife still remembers to cook for you. I though it's all over when someone's dead. It's not a good thing. You watch out for a dog that comes by itself in the next few days, it's your son. He's willing to come back in any form just to be with you. Delivery. This way. How much? Keep the change. Hey, where's my egg sandwich? How come there's so much stuff? I only ordered a sandwich. The ghost did it again. Sir, I'm scared. I quit. How can your wife be a ghost like this? The living and the dead should be on different paths. No wonder, your daughter has become M'am Meng's protg. My daughter is M'am Meng's protg? Your daughter has become an apprentice to M'am Meng, to lead the dead into the underworld. And she has some power... Don't eat it! It must be your daughter abusing her power and putting on this sneaky family reunion. If she gets caught, you'll all pay for it. But what if... I really want this reunion? If that's what you really want... just pretend you don't know. And hope it'll get by. Just pretend these are egg sandwiches and eat it, as if they're egg sandwiches. How are you going to get home without your maid? No problem, I live close by. I can get a cab if I really can't make it. Taxi... How come there's a bridge here? How come there's a river here? Help... Maria. Maria, sir has fallen and can't get home... Maria, sir has fallen and can't get home... Maria... Sir has fallen and can't get home... You can see me? Maria, you can see me? Ghost... You all see me? Ghost! Honey! I'm back. Sir. I'm here. Over here! Sorry sir, I've left you behind. Maria, you know I'm clumsy, and you left me like this, and I've taken a fall. I won't dare do this again, sir. Come help me up. I'm warning you! Don't do this again! Fine... Let's go home, Maria. This is a peculiar moment, like a coin dropping on the ground, but strangely standing just on its edge. We don't want to spoil it, just carefully maintain the fragile balance. Wow, Mrs. Tong is really something! That maid is so scared that she left her luggage behind. Maria, I wanna hear some music. Are you Mrs. Tong's twin sister? Are you human? Thanks, could you pretend that you haven't seen me? Mom... I'm back. Oscar. Ghost.... Did Mrs. Chan give us the dog? Yes, sir. Thank you, Mrs. Chan. Sir, have this and take an early rest. Mom. We've scared others, we've got to move. God bless me... It's sis. Melody, how come Oscar became a dog? Mom, Oscar wants it this way. The only way we could be with Dad is to do sneakily. We'll all live at the cemetery from now on. Mom, I go to work. What work do you do? I'm now M'am Meng's protg in the underworld. Work hard! I will. What does M'am Meng's protg do? I bring these dead friends to reincarnate. You're great, Melody! Let's get working. Dad has gotten up. Maria. Maria. Yes, sir. When was the last time you cleaned the floor? Sorry, sir, I'll do it now. How come I can't hear any cable car this morning? Maria. Let's walk the dog. Yes, sir. Hold tight, my dead friends, you'll soon start your new reincarnated lives. Hold tight, my dead friends, you'll soon start your new reincarnated lives. (Dad is imitating Melody driving) (the Underworld Express to...) I finally heard Mom's laugh. So writing novels can really help the healing process. She is putting flowers at home for the first time since Dad's death. Writing novels makes me happy. I feel close to my wife and children. I can smell the flowers in my home. It smells so good. Where should I put them, Melody? On the tea table. Tea table. On the piano. On the piano. Window. Television, dining room. Stove. Table. By the window. By the bookcase. Though we're only reunited inside a novel, I'm happy with that. No, not enough. Oscar, we'll go and get more. Good. Not enough... I need more scents, and colors, capiche? Ok... I'm leaving, sir. Let's go. Somebody hurt! Forget the keys again. Who is it? We're the police. Are Mandy Ching and Oscar Tong living here? And they are your... Mother and brother. Anyone else at home? Your mother and brother were killed in an accident on Flower Street Forget the keys again. Who is it? We're the police. Does Mandia, Maria V live here? Yes. And you are... Filipino maid. What happened? she had an accident on Flower Street. She was dead on the scene. What accident? A fallen canopy. Fallen canopy? Why is it my family again? Sir, calm down. Is there anyone else at home? No, I'm the only damn blind man left in this family. Sir, we'll contact a counselor for you. Why not call God? Why my family again? Why my family again? Why don't you take me away as well? Take me away! Kill me! Don't leave me alone! Our whole family already hides humbly inside the novel. Why can't they just let us be? What've we done wrong? Not enough, not colorful enough. Let's get to work. What happened? Oh, no! Underworld Express, take me to find my Mom, Dad and brother. Hey... Why can't fate just let go of me? I was driving. That makes me responsible for my family's death. I asked Maria to buy flowers so she died too? Thanks, very nice. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have put on this reunion. I did all this. My family has nothing to do with it. The coin on its edge will drop even if it's just touched slightly. When the me inside the novel crosses paths with Maria, it will be time to wake up. Mom. Dad. Hubby. Honey. Somebody Hurt! Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey, Oscar... Honey, Oscar. Just punish me for it, not my family, no! (Dad has just finished typing) (the part about the disappearance) (of Mom and Oscar, Melody) (and the Underworld Express) (As if he is bidding farewell) (again with his family...) (Dad holds on to the typewriter,) (weeping in agony,) (sitting in solitude in his chaotic home,) (lonely and helpless...) Mom, Oscar, please don't die! Mom and Oscar haven't died. Mom and Oscar haven't died... In a novel, anything is possible. No fate, no chances. I challenge death, and death takes its revenge by taking my Mom and brother. I can carry on writing, and bring them back to life in the novel. I won't give up and I will bring them back. Yes? Are you looking for a domestic helper? Can you start right now? Yes. I haven't eaten for days. Make me noodles, and tidy up my house. It's ready. How can I eat if you don't turn over the table? I'm tidying up the place. Are you blind? Why be a domestic helper? I'm by myself and have nowhere to go. You're by yourself and I want to take care of you. How do you know I'm on my own? Don't kick me out, let me stay. Why do you want to stay? How did you become blind? A car accident when I was 12. Who else was in your family? My mother and brother. When did it happen? Where are they? Gone to another world. Another world? You mean dead? Where's your father? What's your name? Who are you? Hey, why don't you answer me? Are you human, or ghost? I'm a ghost. I miss you and want to see you. Melody? Dad. Why? Melody. Mom. Melody. Melody. Mom... Mom and Oscar really didn't die. Mom. Melody. Melody. Mom. Melody! Honey! Hubby... where are you? So I really could die in their place. Mom, no need to worry. I'm with Dad. It's ok as long as you and Oscar are fine. Melody, there're ghosts in Dad's world! You're Melody? How come you're Melody? What? You all died in the car crash last year. You were 12 and Oscar was only 5. Are you human, or ghost? Mom, Oscar. Hubby. Honey, where are you? How come I can't see you? Mom, I'm fine. Melody. Sis. Oscar, Mom. How come it looks so much like my house? In that accident... Dad survived but went blind, Mom and Oscar and I were dead. There're ghosts in Dad's world. We'll return to him... as ghosts. Mom and Oscar didn't die. It was me who was killed by the fallen canopy. I went to Dad's world. Where are we, Mom? I don't know, but I see lots of Dad. Husband's gone, wife's gone, son's gone, daughter's gone. You 3 are dead, please go on to your next life. Who're you? M'am Meng. We're dead? You were crushed by the fallen canopy 2 days ago. Oscar, we're dead. How come you're dead, Melody? M'am Meng, how did she die? Melody Tong is not dead. How come you're here? Go away! Don't make me leave! Melody Tong is dead. Melody. Mandy Ching and Oscar Tong did not die. It was Melody Tong who got crushed by the fallen canopy on Flower Street. Who're you? How come you have a book of the dead? Little M'am Meng who controls life and death There can only be one M'am Meng. February 2nd, 2008, 14:14 hour, Mandy Ching 42, Oscar Tong 15, they are crushed to death by a canopy on Flower Street. It's all correct. February 8, 2008, 14:14, Melody Tong was buying flowers at Flower Street. The canopy fell and Melody Tong was the only person got killed in the accident. Yours is not the real one. It was me who was buying flowers with Oscar. How come it was Melody that got killed by the canopy? I am dead. It was me who went to buy flowers, and me who died. It was Melody Tong who got killed, you let them go. Quiet! (Mandy Ching 42, Oscar Tong 15,) (they are crushed to death) (by a canopy on Flower Street) I was right. It wasn't you who died. Go back and live a good life. Melody. Sis. Mom. Mom, Oscar. Mom, Oscar. Melody. Melody. M'am Meng, I am dead, it was me who got crushed. It was me who went to buy flowers, and me who died. Melody, what's going on? Where're Mom and Oscar? M'am Meng, I am dead, it was me who got crushed. It was me who went to buy flowers, and me who died. Melody. Dad is here. M'am Meng, Let me back! I'm really dead? The canopy killed my wife and son, and my daughter is left by herself. Melody. I want to go back... I'll get back if I am dead. Melody... Don't... Help... She is trying to kill herself, Help! You've gone too far... I won't let you die. Let Dad beg you. Melody, don't! Please have the M'am Meng soup and go on to your next life. No, I can't let go of my daughter. They won't board the car. They are not dead. Hubby! Dad! You were killed in a car accident How come you're only entering the afterlife now? Which one is mine and which one is yours? They're not dead. Who are you? You're messing up life and death! M'am Meng, don't send my daughter away! Dad, Mom! You're M'am Meng? Does my daughter kill herself? What're you talking about, honey? I saw her hanging herself, cutting her wrists, but I couldn't stop her. I'm dead already. You're not. Dad knows you've grown up. I'm dead already. I know, you're Melody Tong who wants to be dead. February 10th 2008, 14:24, Melody Tong, 22 years old, dies from jumping off a building. There are 5 more minutes. February 10th 2008, 14:25, Melody Tong, 22 years old, dies from jumping off a building. There are 6 more minutes. How come you die twice? Don't, Melody, don't die! We'll be a family again soon. No! Dad won't let you die! M'am Meng, how can I save my daughter? You daughter wants to die because you haven't moved on, and you've dragged her along. Have the M'am Meng Soup and move on to next life. If we move on, our daughter won't die? I don't know. If you can't let go, she won't either. Don't drink it! You won't remember me after you've drunk it! We'll never be together again! Why is it my family again? What have we done wrong? No one's at fault. Death is not a punishment, it's a part of life. The Books of Life includes all families, there's death, separation and reunion in the next life in each and every one of them. Let go, Melody. Let's get going. Sit tight, my dead friends, we'll soon go into the afterlife. Die once. Mom? Dad? Oscar? How come I can see? Am I dead? (Melody Tong, 22 years old,) (dies jumping off a building) Sorry, I won't do it again. Mom, Dad, Oscar, I'll remember to be good from now on. If death is not the end, there's M'am Meng, the Underworld Express, there's a farewell and a new life, I won't be scared any more. In the novel, things will happen as I wish. I write my novel and decide life and death. But who's writing the story in the real world? Who decides life and death? If you spare my life, I'll live it to the fullest. If not, let me see my family. In the novel, I use death as a way out. In real life, I'd chose to live and jumped back to the roof. In the beginning, I wrote the novel about Mom and Oscar and tried to heal Mom. Now, I'm the only one left behind, trying to heal myself. I feel better right this minute, but I may feel agony the next. This is the way it has to be. I'll tell myself to live better each day. To live a long life. To life a good life.
