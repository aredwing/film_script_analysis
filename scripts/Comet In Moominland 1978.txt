I am, Moomintroll Senior, begining to write memoirs about how I am and my family... Ah-h-h... Moomintroll. Yes, daddy. Tell me, what is a memoirs? This is when kitty's miaowing. Miaow-moris. And what are you thinking, Sniff? This is when the cow's mooing. Moo-moo-oiris. He-he, no-o... The memoirs is the reminiscences. I am begining to write the reminiscences. So, I'm reminiscing about myself having sat down to write the memoirs. My wife, Moominmamma, as now as I remember, was cooking dinner. Eh-eh, what will we have for dinner? There'll be pasties with apples. Aha, we'll have pies with apples for the dinner, I've been remembring. What a good miaow-moris. What a delicious moo-moo-oiris. And write the reminiscences what will be for supper. Who will be fooing around they will be taken by Groke dreadful and terrible one. What is it? Agh-r-r! Here! This is the Hobgoblin. A relative of ours. Howdy! How do you do. Grandaddy, any tea or coffee for you? One plate of tea, one plate of coffee. And not a single drop more, I am in a hurry. And what happened? A fire? A world catastrophe? On the contrary. This evening a public holiday happened out of nowhere. For evrybody. Eh-h, where? Where will be more funny there will be public holiday. It's all. Ciao cacao! Let's start running to chose where is more funny. I know one road... that is, a mysterious way It's lead to not known where. I like when I'm strolling Then I'm waging my tail Then I am, Then I am never being bored ever. Moomin, look! Here is it, the mysterious way! Are they ghosts or no? It seemed to me that this is Groke dreadful and terrible one. Ah, it's a nonsense. The water. And what is this? The lighthouse, probably. Let's go to swim. I won't go! Wanting to dive, dive worse for oneself! Ah, it's a nonsense. He-e-elp! Save! Save! Save! Help! Help! Help! Why are you screaming! Sa-ve... He's dro-wned. Who? Moomin-troll. A brother. We know your brother. There he is. Hey, Sniff, look what I've found! What's the matter with you? So, what have you found there? Here! Isn't it yours, is it? No, it isn't mine. This is a golden bangle of one little girl, who's name Snork. Hm-m-m... She closely resembles you, hm... She's probably lost it, that Snork of yours. Bungler! Bungler-Snork! And what's your name? I am Snufkin. Snuf-who? Snuf-kin Sniff and Moomin tin-tin-tin, And without-tail Snufkin... Oh, you are not offended, are you? What a lot of things! What is it for? For the disguise. Why, are you hiding? Whom from? It doesn't matter. Have you anything more? I have. I have everything I see, everything I'm thinking about. The whole world! Might I take a little bit? Take as much as you want. He-e-e-elp! Hush. It seems to me... I'm just on my way. Await me here. Oh, what a disgusting bush! So, like this! Oh, what a courageous you are! Ah, it's a nonsense. It is beautiful here. I wanted something... Oh, I wanted something... I forgot. Yes, you... Haven't you lost the bangle? Ah! So pleasantly! Thank you! Then I know what is your name! Your name is... Bungler... Oh! bungler... Oh! I forgot what further... Call me just... Snork! Here, this is Snork. Moomin is a real hero! He's saved me from a terrible bush! In that cave over there. And why did you get into the cave? Fool! The sparks are the little spirits of the fire. I have quarreled recently with Groke about them. With Groke! Ah-h-h-h!!! Why, yes! With Groke. She had frozen them in the volcano, but I freed them! Since then Groke are looking for me everywhere. Yes, and we have the public holiday today! I'm inviting you, will you allow? There's will not be public holiday! We haven't found a place! But I've found. This is the cave. It is very beautiful there. Well, it's time for me to go... Why, are you going away? Yes. I get used to being alone. This way the thinking is better. So clever, and so lonely... Good bye! But the things! You've forgotten the things! Sniff, go ask guests over. And Moomin and I will put in order our cave. You know, Snork, I perhaps on public holiday will change Snufkin's clothes. There'll be a masked ball. Wait for me. I will be back soon. Guests! Guests! Do make acquaintance. This is Thingumy and Bob. Whether they are foreigners or they are going to a nursery school.
