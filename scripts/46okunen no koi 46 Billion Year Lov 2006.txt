Light, that hits something, brakes and throws vague reflections Reflections... Somewhere, at a certain point, If you look straight ahead, you can see the Earth from a year ago, if you look to the right, Earth a hundred years ago, if you look to the left, Earth a thousand years ago, if you look about, Earth ten thousand years ago. At this certain point. Eyes closed, you can hear the light coming from four directions. You can feel the smell of its weak echo deep inside of the body. Its smelling color - this color is spinning a semi-lucent veil. And this veil covers Tokyo in the year 2005 western calculation of times. The numbers of the calendars will loose their meaning. Like a wet capsule the veil dissolves. And the familiar picture begins to change. Like an afar, distant memory blurred mist is rising. Remarks and impressions appear aggrandized.

Tonight, you must undergo the ritual of manhood... to become a strong man like him. Reach the shore, purify yourself in the ocean. After that, he'll teach you... what to do. Finally he... aims for your throat releasing his manhood. For ages we've become men in this manner. handing down manly viror to our predecessors. BIG BANG LOVE I... I... I killed him. The culprit is called Jun Ariyoshi, the victim is called Shiro Kazuki. Both of them were convicted for murder. Both came to prison on the same day. Their crimes were not related. Their arrival at the same time was mere chance. What kind of murder brought the delinquent to prison? He worked in a so-called gay bar. On the 24th of December he went to a hotel with an over 40 year old regular. He was raped, cracked up and killed him. However, the injuries on the victim's body were so severe that it was difficult to to explain it as self defence. Assumed time of death: between 10 p.m. and midnight, up to the discovery on the following mornig at 8 a.m. the culprit he mutilated the corpse repeatedly. Was it the same this time? Probably not. PRISON Kazuki, stop it! Here you are going to serve your sentence. Keep in mind: Who has killed someone often atones with his own life. How you serve your time, is up to you. It's new for him. Show him how it's done. What are you waiting for? Strip! Should I help you? Don't act like that. Hey, you strip too. Cut the crap! Excuse me. I'm coming to clean up. We are having a strip-search now. Come back later. Excuse me. I'll show you the cell. You are going to come and meet the prison warden as soon as he is back. And behave yourself. Understood? Answer me. Hey, you there Get in. Two new entrants. Those two are free. Pick one of them. It stinks. Where are you from? Nobody asked you. Hey, where are you from? Hey, fatass. It stinks. Clean it up. What? - Come on. Are you nuts? The new ones clean up... Wanker! Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard! - Kazuki! I'd be happy with a solitary cell. CELL 5 Hey, why isn't it possible? Decision of the prison warden. He can't fulfill a request of an inmate who is causing trouble. Ariyoshi, you are coming too! To come and greet the warden. Here are the new entries from today. Shiro Kazuki and Jun Ariyoshi. I am warden Takatsu. I too am new here. And I hope, that we will develop a good relationship between us newcomers. You are still young. You just have to try, Then you can start from afresh. Of course you can't erase the past. You can't undo your actions But do you understand, why that is impossible? Because they have already happened. That's why it is impossible. You have already become guilty. You can commit similar crimes, But never exactly the same. You have to live in a different time. It doesn't matter what you are going to do. If you are going to spend your time, commiting similar crimes, or if you are going to live as decent members of the society, or if you'll do neither. That you make a new beginning as decent members of society, is all that I want. Kazuki to field work, Ariyoshi to the laundry. Go! Did anything happen on the outside lately? We have neither newspapers, television or magazines. I have no idea, what the world looks like. Not really. Nothing in particular. That's supposed to be ancient. If you climb to the top, you reach heaven, they say. Where do you want to go with that? No! Really? Where was that? Polynesia? There is said to be this great custom somewhere in the south. Some kind of reflection-function? - Exactly. He said he wants to drink something. We are closing now. Already? - I'm sorry! I want to keep on drinking. - Jun, will you switch off the light-sign? I was locked up. When I regained consciousness I was locked up. What's that? I said get mine first. Are you listening to me? This hand... You just wait... WHAT KIND OF MAN DO YOU WANT TO BE? What kind of murder brought the delinquent to prison? Last year, on the 24th of December he was raped by a regular, he lost control and killed him. However... However, the injuries on the victims body were so severe that it was difficult to explain it as self defence. Assumed time of death: between 10 p.m. and midnight. up to the discovery on the following mornig at 8 a.m. he he mutilated the corpse repeatedly. I... I... killed him. I killed him. I killed him. Was it the same this time? Probably not. Those are traces of a rope or something similar. Why strangle him again with his hands? - Yes, but... Perhaps it is his manner, to mutilate the corpse? And the rope? Where did it disappear to? I... I killed him. Supposed that's true where did you hide the murder weapon? Where is the rope? What are you thinking? MOTIVE Hey! Your man is fucking some other guy in the ass. I'm talking to you, bitch. Whatch out, or he'll beat you up. - I'm afraid! That wasn't you, who Kazuki fucked in the fields? First I thought that it is you Same build It was shortly before noon. He even was so polite to strip him naked. I'm sorry. You go ahead. Your man is fucking some other guy in the ass. I'm talking to you, bitch. Watch out, or he'll beat you up. - I'm afraid! That wasn't you, who Kazuki fucked in the fields? First I thought that it is you Same build It was shortly before noon. He even was so polite to strip him naked. Do you let Kazuki fuck you? No. One doesn't know whether you let yourself getting fucked, or if you're hetero. What about women? Not interested? Not particularly. Actually I don't care about them. And men? The sex makes me nauseous. So both are no good? I don't know. And you? Women of course! I sell my ass to get by, once in a while. But I would never fuck a guy. That's disgusting. Yes, disgusting... You are the one who is disgusting. Sumio. What? Come over here. What is it? I'm waiting in the nursery. That is Tsuchiya. He is working in the nursery? He has a special position. It's quite useful to have him on your side. It's no use. You carry on. What? Nothing. If he didn't do it, who else could have a motive? The warden would have a reason, to kill Kazuki. Vengeance. INVESTIGATION Before, when you were warden of a different prison you have already met Kazuki. Yes, he came as an inmate. That was five years ago. I don't quite understand. What do you mean by that? WHY DID HE COME TO PRISON? Rape. He raped my wife. And by chance he came to the prison, where I was warden. It was a cruel coincidence. HOW DID YOUR WIFE TAKE IT? She commited suicide. I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. EXCUSE ME, BUT DIDN'T YOU LOVE HER? You're being rude. But to put it straight: I hated Kazuki. It is possible, that I wanted to kill him more than anybody else. But I'm not just the husband of my wife, I'm also a public servant in an institution for the rehabilitation of criminal offenders. I couldn't control my hate anymore. and killed Shiro Kazuki. That's what you wanted to say? It is not true. I certainly didn't do it. I even have an alibi for the time of the incident. DO YOU PUT YOUR WORK BEFORE EVERYTHING? That's not it... WHAT IS IT THEN? Perhaps it's just too plain to me how powerless I am. HOW DO YOU MEAN THAT? Regardless what we do or don't do, it has no influence on the inmates. Who wants to make amends is doing it because of his bad conscience. Regardless how much we try, some commit a crime again. Like Kazuki, who commited murder again and came here. WHAT DOES YOUR STRANGE SMILE MEAN? Man is weak. Perhaps it's just me. But nevertheless, I can't give up hope, that the world will get better. THEN YOUR SMILE IS A PRAYER? Perhaps a curse too. On a world, that doesn't work as planned. EVERYBODY HAD ACCESS TO THE CRIME SCENE? As long as he was in prison.. It was lunch time, everybody could go there. I cannot claim that I never had the notion to kill him. Is it really true, that he got strangled? WITHOUT A QUESTION. WHY? Then somebody knocked him out from behind, so that he was unconscious? HE HAD NO INJURIES, WHY? Well, because... This guy? There is no one who could kill him, not in this prison... not far and wide. far and wide! But people, who wanted to get to his throat, are probably aplenty. If I had tried, I would have died myself for sure here But if Ariyoshi should have killed him... THEN WHAT? Well, I don't know... He seemed to be something special, somehow. If you ask me, if somebody could have killed him, then Ariyoshi is perhaps not so far off. THERE IS A CONFESSION. I killed him. I killed him THERE IS A MOTIVE. Your man is fucking some other guy in the ass. BUT THERE IS NO PROOF. SOMEBODY ELSE HAS A MOTIVE. It is not true. I certainly didn't do it. I even have an alibi for the time of the incident. IT WAS VERIFIED. At the time of the crime the warden wasn't in the prison. DID SOMEBODY ELSE KILL ON HIS COMMAND? There is a possibility. It's not to rule out. DID THE WARDEN KNOW THE PERPETRATOR? I met Jun Ariyoshi here in prison for the first time. That seems to be true. WHO ELSE BUT YOU HAD A MOTIVE? Who didn't have one? If you want, the whole prison. DID THE VICTIM HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS? With nobody in particular. If you believe the rumors, with a boy called Yukimora. The guy who is working in the laundry with Ariyoshi. But that's not proven. The person in question is denying it. I didn't have anything with Kazuki. WHAT DID YOU DO AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME? I ate. At least that's what I think. WHO ELSE HAD SEX WITH KAZUKI? How should I know? Probably Ariyoshi, or not? I suspected it and asked him the other day. But even if, he didn't admit it. Could Yukimura be the culprit? No chance. Even if he fucked him... Never. He had no reason to kill Kazuki. Did the culprit try to protect Yukimura? Never. No way. Never. - No. So what do we have at this point? A confession and traces of a strangulation. I killed him. But... The rope is missing, to connect them both. That means... WHAT KIND OF BACKGROUND DID THE VICTIM HAVE? A terrible background. He grew up in the worst circumstances at least by today's standards. It's nearly impossible to describe. But others who grew up like that didn't lose their way, and lived a honest life. But But I find it difficult, to demand that therefore everybody has to make it. In such an extreme case. I remember. He often stole something. It was strange. The parents apparently didn't say anything about it. I caught him several times and brought him to his parents. I even brought him to the police But it was no use. He always came again and stole jelly breads Yes, always just jelly breads. He never took anything different. VOICE UNIDENTIFIABLE In my . Not my , but . In the 8th grade. I would really like to kill him for that. What? He was murdered? The parents, the sex offender... How could they do something like that to a small child? I don't know either. How long would you have to trace this crazy chain back? At the next signal the time is and twenty seconds. At the next signal the time is and 30 seconds. At the next signal the time is and 40 seconds. At the next signal the time is and 50 seconds. At the next signal the time is 1 p.m. and exactly 29 minutes. Are we going to see it? BEACH Where do you want to go? Into heaven? Or space? Heaven... If it really exists, into space. Why? Because there are certainly fewer people. Except aliens perhaps. Nonsense. So you do believe that there is a heaven? You only offered two options. Do you think there is one? After death. I don't know. What do you think? Doesn't matter what I think If there is one, there is one, if not, then not. Why... Why are fewer people better? Because they pull me down. Why do you have sex then? Because I'm getting nervous otherwise. Why not with me? If it's only about that. I want to be like you. Let it be. Why? You can't reverse it. Why not? You are going crazy. Why do you protect me sometimes? This hand... Hey, wait! Stop it... - Kazuki! And where do you wan't to go? You've asked too. - Into space, I think. And where do you really want to go? Heaven, I think. That's why. What? I would be sorry if I made you crazy I'm already crazy Perhaps. I'll go there You go over there Can't I come with you? Where? We already know that you didn't do it. I killed him. But... if I didn't do it... The rainbow the threefold. What? ELEGY Come. The warden wants to speak with you I've got field work. - Not today. I don't know why we are doing this we have to wash it all again as soon as the sun is shining. They are making a point of us doing the same work every day. Sumio. Come over here. What is it? I'm waiting in the nursery. Is that OK? No problem I'm really sorry, every time. What did he want to talk about with you? A ghost. Last night my wife came to me. She is worried about you. She feels bad about you, she said. She commited suicide and is asking herself, if she caused you pain with that. She wanted that I hurry over to you to tell you that "It doesn't matter to me anymore" That's why she came to me. I should say something on her behalf. Don't torment yourself. Forget everything, focus on your future and begin a new life. Sugar... or milk? What did he want to talk about with you? A ghost. A rainbow. A double... A threefold? Or... am I wrong? Perhaps I don't want to be like you after all? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it... Stop it! The rainbow... The rainbow... cornered him. At the next signal the time is exactly 3 p.m. SOLVING At the next signal the time is Fuck... The culprit turned himself in. Suicide attempt. Why did you choke Kazuki? Stop it! Stop it! You are scaring me. Sumio. Come over here. What is it? I'm waiting in the nursery. Is that OK? No Problem. I'm really sorry, every time. You really didn't have anything with him? With who? Kazuki? No! I've said that already. Not that I would have minded... Then why did you say to Tsuchiya that you had sex with Kazuki This guy won't let up. He has a lot... He has a special position. he can provide me with a lot of stuff. Drugs and stuff. It's not like he was dealing with it. But so that he gave me something, I let him get close. Giving and taking. But he is nuts. Say it arleady! You have fucked. Come on, say it. He got on my nerves so much, that I said what he wanted to hear. He just didn't want to believe that there was nothing. "You are lying!" "You have definatly fucked", he said. I will begin... AND WHO DID KAZUKI MOLEST? Like I said, I have no idea! Well, if it really wasn't Ariyoshi... Let me think who else looks like us... Yazawa from cell 4, or Hara from cell 1. THE PERPETRATOR IS CALLED MAKOTO TSUCHIYA, THE VICTIM SHIRO KAZUKI. WHY DID THE PERPETRATOR COME TO PRISON? HE MURDERED HIS UNFAITHFUL WIFE. DID YOU REPEAT YOUR CRIME? I have regretted it. That... That I... That I laid hand on my wife. First... I thought I should have killed her lover. But... in the end... You must not kill anybody, right? So suicide would be... Suicide would be better, I thought. And then... TO KILL YOURSELF, YOU STRANGLED KAZUKI? Yes. He... He would kill me, I thought. Until he overpowered me, until he killed me, I didn't want to stop. I would again and again, again and again... try to kill him, I thought. But... Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I didn't see him again, after he was in the nursery Then I heard he hung himself. WHY DID YOU CONCEAL THAT? I didn't conceal anything. I only was asked if I had something with Kazuki. And I never would have thought that this moron could kill Kazuki. He really killed him? Was that better? Then space? I would have done it for you. If you wanted to die... that much. Is it over? Let me do this at least. If you are dead, is it over then? Even that you wanted to leave to someone else. If there wouldn't have been a rainbow, had I... not taken him into my arm, what would have happened? I... I killed him. WHO WANTED TO KILL HIM THE MOST? The man, whose wife he raped. WHAT MADE HIM CRAZY? The cirmumstances he grew up in. At least partially. THE MOTIVE OF THE PERPETRATOR? Suicide. WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE SUICIDE? A mistake. Developed from lies and rumors. WAS THE VICTIM MURDERED? He probably killed himself. WHAT WAS THE TRIGGER? According to a witness account, a threefold rainbow. WHY IS THE RAINBOW THE TRIGGER? That... only he himself knows. If it is that way, what sense does it make to arrest this man? That's the law. The case is completely solved. If there is one, there is one, if not, then not Is it over? Or can we see each other again? A whale. The since uncountable years living Lord of the sea is returning to heaven. Become a real man.
