Confession may better your chances in the hereafter. It is doubtful, but it may, by some twist of fate. A wealth of evidence has convicted thee of trafficking with the devil. Thou art to be hanged... And then burned over a basket of living cats. There is no question left but one. Do you choose to admit your crimes before man and God? You'll get nothing from him. 'Tis as I said. That's the whole of it, then. Let the record show that this obscene wretch, though afforded opportunity, did fail to confess his crimes. Sentence shall be carried out in timely fashion. We stand adjourned. Terrified, were they not? Bold words for a man but hours from death. Much can happen in a day. Yet here have you hung for 3. Would not Satan have saved you were he thus inclined? Perhaps he'll save us both, Redferne. I've tracked you my last. Tomorrow shall you die. Never was there a brute more deserving. Believe it upon seeing it. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. The thumb locks, they shall be kept in place even after he is hanged, even while he burns. When there is naught but ash, only then should they be... Only then can they be dug free and returned to me. My dear God! ...downed power lines and blown-out windows. Another report claims a tornado touched down in the Malibu area, but that's, as yet, unconfirmed. What is certain is that this Santa Ana condition, unpredicted by forecasters, is quickly living up to its namesake of the Devil's Wind. Now back... Was that you? He's breathing. Watch out for the glass. It's a wonder he didn't cut himself worse. Canyon Country. Gets 'em all. Think he's just drunk? Hate to think he does this kind of thing sober. So what the heck are these? Hey, don't touch him. Let the cops do that stuff. Yeah. Right. Oh, the winds. Well, come on. Let's get him up. Yeah, let's stick him on the porch. A little compassion wouldn't hurt, Kassandra. Or some smarts, Chas. You just can't take in every stray that you meet. I took you in, didn't I? No, no, no. Not the sofa. It's over a hundred years old. Where? Your room. Mine? Everything's plastic. Miraculous recovery you made. Let me make a suggestion... lose the booze, huh? Phones are workin'. Got someone you can call? Could this somehow be the year? Hey, Chas, he talks english. English english. 3 centuries. Oh, brother. Look, just lie down here. Let your big, gray Delco recharge. Jeez! Oof. Don't ever let me get old. Jeez Louise, you scared me. I'm headin' out in a little while. I'll give you a lift downtown. What are you looking at? Oh, my ring. I'm a Scorpio. Or I was. I don't believe in astrology much anymore. Truly? I don't think anyone does. I mean, it's just so Sixties. You hungry? I got plenty of extras. Look... I'd let you try it on, but, see, I broke this little finger, and now it's pretty much... stuck. Did I hear Kassandra say something about England? I was over there in '86. I did this package thing with, like, some friends. We included England, Scotland... Help! Help! Help! Somebody! Please! Help! Help! No. Please. No! Private clubs, ads. Really, he's just a guy I rented a room from. If he was coming, I was always going. Did he frequent public parks? He didn't dick little boys through bathroom walls. You said your roommate was gay. Not queer. Big difference. Can you give me the names of his lovers? Coroner's notes... "Victim was found with tongue severed from mouth "in such a manner as to suggest it was bitten out. Bite marks on the back of the neck. Evidence of... " you about done? I forgot my insulin. We'd like to find this guy before he makes an omelet out of somebody else's tongue. I'll see you! Thank you. Don't thank me, thank Treshar. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye, Fern. You are a spiritualist? I'm sorry. I thought everybody left. You hail spirits, do you not? I channel them. Were you at the session? Then channel me a spirit. Well, I really only do grope... group sessions. Group sessions. Channel me a spirit. Who did you have in mind? Like a relative? Like a father. What's his name? He has many. I'll need one. Zamiel. Zamiel. I have come... Zamiel. Ask me what you will. I would ask that we wait. For what do we wait? For the true Zamiel to appear. I am Zamiel... And only when you have cast aside all doubts will you be able to ask... me... Able to... to... To... ask... ask me... ask... Ask me what thou will. How comes it that you have brought me here? Bring together that which has been thirded. Bring together my bible. The Grand Grimoire? Here? Now? By a resourceful witch, it could be retaken. My efforts... How might they be rewarded? Service to Satan is reward! For others surely, but for that most cunning witch who steals back your bible, the book that can thwart creation itself, what for him? Do what I demand. Bring together all 3 parts, and you shall be him. Him? The one begotten son. It shall be me. Let mine eyes guide thee. Did he bleed? The one who wore these, did he bleed whatsoe'er. No. No. Stop. Get off. He was here. His signature I know. But I can find the beast only if his blood was spilt. He came through this window, did he not? Landing here. The blond-haired guy? Him? Was he cut? Show me where. This may do. Police emergency. Yeah. Some guy's in the house with me. I don't know how dangerous he is, but he's got a thing for blood. You know. Draw your own conclusions. I've got your address on the screen. 3237 Woodburn. Can I have your name? Kassandra with a "K." We'll have a car there in a few minutes. Don't expect me to be waiting around for you 'cause I'm skating right now. Your well, where would it be? My whale? Your well... the place you draw water. Oh, sure. My well. Now, brute, one last time will we play the game out. What is it? Please, do not even breathe on it. Some kind of compass? Witch compass. This one here? What of it? What is it? As I say, 'tis a witch compass. Ohh. You mean witch... Not which. Like Samantha, Tabitha witch. Like the warlock. Th-that guy was a warlock? The rudest that ever troubled daylight. And this little jobber's going to find him, right? The needle shall point up his direction. The quicker it swings, the closer is he. The slower, the more distant. Way cool. What a cup of shit. This isn't gonna work. Give it time. The blood was thin. Time's something you ain't got, Buddy. Though first I did think this was Newcastle or a township of the Carolinas, I think I'm farther removed. Much farther. Hey, somebody's coming out. Freeze, police! Watch his hands. Watch it! He lays waste to all in his path. The place matters not. Hear me when I say he's evil. Evil absolute. We'll run him down to the station, but in the meantime, here's some advice. Get away from this house. You got a watch? Yeah. Time me. You've reached 911 police emergency. Please stand by. Your call will be handled as soon as an operator becomes available. Ohh! Tout, tout, through and about, your callow life in dismay. Rentum oscillum tormentum. A decade twice over a day. This guy put some kind of hoodoo hex spell on me. He made me 40 instead of 20. Is that what this guy did? There's no crime of which he's incapable. Hey, hey, uh... ahem. Other door, ok? Other door. Not a local product, are you? Too late! The evil one is back! It's too late! 16 hundred and 91? Aye. Like almost 300 years ago? As queer it seems to you, 'tis even more so to me. He did this? 20 fuckin' years, and not one party. What a total ass-burn. The altar table, he broked it? Yeah, he broked it. Hey, look, I didn't spring you so you could come fix furniture. What about me? How do we fix my face? What was it he took from you? 20 years. An object. What kind of object? Something small. Something personal to you. My bracelet. Like that? He took my charm bracelet. Then you must reclaim it. Only then can the spell be countered. Reclaim it? This I spied earlier. 'Tis yours? The whole of it? Just salt. We'll take your coach. We'll take a minute here. Do you mean I gotta get my bracelet back to break the spell? Back from that warlock... the guy who finger-paints with body fluids? 'Tis the one way. This you must do. There is no question of it. You see this? Insulin. It's the one thing I must do. I hate it 'cause I have to do it! I'll just cut and dye my hair again. Hey, 40 ain't so bad. I'll buy a little tennis skirt and prance around town like those bitches in their BMWs. Sorry, Redferne, but if you're nuts enough to wanna find this guy, you're on your own. You realize not. Realize? What? What the spell has done. It's aged me 20 years. Not aged. Aging. Are you saying that tomorrow I'm gonna wake up... 60? I say this. Unless you find the warlock and thereby your bracelet, you shall die in but half a week. Die? Of old age. That didn't help. Let's tarry not. Hey, let's get things straight. All I want is the bracelet. I don't give a sailing shit what he did to you. Look... Soon as I'm 20 again, you are on your own, got that, Bud? Look, if you're hungry, we'll just stop. Ok, what are you doing? Salting the leather. No kidding. How come? Witches loathe salt. Don't blame 'em. Salt, sugar, sulfites. All that shit will kill you. Tell me... Must we travel on just one side of the roadway, or is it whichever we choose? Yeah. It's just one side. Which side might that be? The right side. Let your attention lie before you, not beside you. Check this. Some guy from the 17th century teaching me how to drive. How quick they learn. He's gotta go deep. He's gotta go deep. He needs 10 yards. It's fourth. It's fourth and 10. He's going! He hikes the ball, throws it. Good! Gets it again. Gets it again. Makes a pass! Throws it up. When you pass, you can't let those little stick guys get between you and the receiver, or else they'll keep intercepting, ok? Yeah! 6 points! Now I kick off to you. You can't punt on first down. Nobody does that, not even Tampa Bay. Don't you watch football? Whence comes it? Huh? The music. Oh, there's a church over there. And how is it you're not there? Oh, I never go. My dad hates all that stuff about Jesus and the 12 apostrophes. Aw! Intercepted. Your turn. How come you're not there? Church? Yeah. It's Sunday. No witch can set foot on church ground. Ha. You're telling me you're a witch? You ain't no witch. Witches are girls. Some are men. Yeah? So where's your broomstick? Witches fly on broomsticks. Didn't you never see the Wizard of Oz? I need no broomstick to fly. Yeah? What do you need? You take Mastercard? With plenty of I.D. We do. 20th century money. Great shit. Spend as much as you want till you hit your limit. Then you've got 50 bucks a whack. What was that? Fellas up in the hills hunting coyote. You eat coyote around here, huh? Well, a boy over at the trailer park was killed by one. They do that sometimes. A coyote will come down, drag off a small child. Boy was fairly well chewed up, so I hear. Skin taken clean off. Pray, wait. It was your son... the boy killed? For your loss I grieve... But I have need to ask one thing. Had he been baptized? Who are you? Why are you asking me this? Was the boy baptized? No. His father wouldn't allow it. So... Clue me. The warlock will travel swifter now. I'm not tracking here. You think he killed the kid? Of all ingredients used by a witch, the most coveted is human fat. If that fat is cut from an unbaptized male child, there is but one purpose, one thing it will beget. I'm listening. Flying potion. You got KKTY, Tucson, ridin' shotgun and keepin' you company... No little people inside. Oh, I gathered. Wanna know how it works? If 'twill help find the warlock. Highly doubtful. Hey, you know the earth is round? For some years now. Ask me anything. I took 2 years of high school. Come on. Ask me something. Why is it you paint your face? Nothing wrong with a little makeup. Especially now. Satanists paint their faces, not goodly women. Are you saying in 1691 gals didn't wear any makeup? If my Marion had but... nay, goodly women do not paint themselves. You married way back there? Well, you just said "my Marion. " Who's she? We need new bearing. Your sister? Pray, stop the coach. Some squeeze? Stop here. Who the shit's Marion? Stop! Ohh, think then talk, banana brain. God. Oh, God. Ohh... God. Ohh. Go on. Go without me. I don't wanna know how bad it is. Please. Please, don't look. Please. No. Oh, my... Why couldn't he just kill me? Nothing could be worse than this. His very thought. The cream's gone bad. Couldn't be. I brought it in just yesterday. Want to taste it? Nah, I got a lot of work to do, dad. If you're done helping Elsie, maybe you can turn out the horse for me. Hey. Hey. Come on, hurry up! I'm gonna beat you! Can I ask you a question? Will you please not have a meltdown this time? Ask. Who's Marion? That's why you're after the warlock, isn't it? Yesterday, you cared not to know such things. Yesterday was 20 years ago. She... She was... Your age... your true age. What a blessed vision. A soul as pure as God's own, my Marion. She was my good wife. I thought you said you weren't married. 'Twas long ago, even before here I came. What happened to her? The warlock happened. Pray, stop the car. What's the matter? Pray, I bid you, stop the car, girl! Redferne. The compass. Leave it! If God stands with us, we'll need it no more! We didn't find him yet, did we? Well, would you look at this? Hmm? The bread. Didn't rise. Browned, but it didn't rise. Must've forgotten to... tell me your woes. You are bewitched. Who are you? The hex mark, is it yours, or is it not? Hex mark? What? I haven't seen a hex mark in 30 years. The mark is mine. Amish? Mennonite. And we are bewitched. From there. Hither has he come. Hammer, nails. Dad, what the devil do you think you're doing? Who are these people? If there are children present, make them absent. Take them and leave. Leave? Wait a minute. I got a schedule to keep. I can't just traipse off and turn this place over... listen to me. The horse that sweats in the morning, cream that sours overnight. You know the signs. We both know. Fix these pennies here. 'Twill ward off any errant magic. On my word, close and brace the stairs. You must open them only when I say. And should ever your eyes meet his, never show him no fear. 'Tis the air he breathes. Hey. Careful. He was here. "Mortes datoris antipueris. " He's come for it. Blessings of heaven, 'tis the Grand Grimoire he's after! The spell book. All witches keep grimoires, yet one is indestructible. One is the bible of black magic. The Grand Grimoire. Always witches have lusted for it. And now here I find a page. One lone page. 'Twas last held by a Boston church. The West End Church. I had urged them to third the book, thus thirding the chance of a witch thieving it. But the pages were to be kept on hallowed ground, not scattered about the landside like... where's the warlock? He's fled. I don't get it. If thing is so bitchin' to witches, why would he leave a page? Even just a page. He would not. The steps! Of all the curiosities here I've seen, none have surprised me more than this. The brace! Forgotten witches fly? I forget nothing. Who appointed you executioner, Redferne? 'Twas you yourself... When one life too many you did steal. It seems even 2 thirds can work marvels. Why'd you let him go? Yes! Remove his boots! His boots! Where's my goddamn bracelet? Ew! Hold his toe. Where's my goddamn bracelet? Nay. Look not in his eyes! Nay! Oh. He's getting away! Keys. Find me brass keys. With them I can remove this hex. The warlock. You can't just let him blow out of here. He'll die should I leave! The hammer! Take it. Where you find his tracks, nail the earth deeply. A nail. Shitty little nail! Give me a shotgun, then I'll... take the blessed hammer! He can be crippled! Nails. Help you? No, no. Feel. Mmm. The keys should be spun once each hour, clockwise. Meddle not with the dressing. By morn' the blood shall stop. How's he doing? I have no excuse. Safe to say that having seen so many die by the warlock's hand, the chance to spare just one life with mine own... forget it. I understand. Besides... I got it back. Then let's tarry not. We'll rebuild the compass. Brass, copper, glass. 'Tis this, his blood, that matters most. Here. And here. You've watched me long enough. The gas is on the right, the brake's on the left. It's more than I knew when I started to drive. Drive, me? And take this. It's for gas. When they give you the slip of paper, just scribble a name. Any name. They never check. You're not coming? Look, you got my car, my money... My best wishes. Later days, Redferne. We had a deal, remember? Just till I got my bracelet back. That was it, man. That was it. You know what he's capable of. You've seen. Why do you think I'm not going? What are you called? It's a little late for introductions, ain't it? Your name. Kassandra with a "K." Then hear me well, Kassandra with a "K." The warlock holds 2 parts of the book. This much he confessed. Know you what happens should he gain all 3? I don't want to know. I don't. Hidden within that book is the name of God. The lost name of God. The lost name of... Uh-uh. I don't want to hear this. 'Tis the name invoked during creation. Witches charge that should this name, this true name of God, be uttered back to front... I'm not listening. LA LA LA LA LA... Should this name be uttered in reverse, all creation will undo. 'Twill reverse. We'll uncreate? That what you're telling me? The whole world just... all worlds, Kassandra. All. Ohh. He scares the crap out of me, and he knows it. I'll not let him harm you. Next time there won't be any spells. No hexes, no potions. Next time he's gonna kill me. I'll not let him harm you. We travel north? Trust me on this, ok? But if all along the warlock has borne east... we're not going to play tag with this guy anymore. What would you have us do? Did kids in 1691 ever play a game where they jump over someone else's back? Leaping frog? There you go. Instead of tag, we play leapfrog. When we get to that church in Boston they got to have records, right? Forget the warlock. We'll find the last part of the book instead. But what happens if the church is no longer standing? I didn't shoot your plan full of holes. Is that, like, the old West End Church, or is that the new West End Church? The one on Somerset Avenue? Nay. 'Twould be Somerset Road. Oh! Close enough. Thanks, operator. Still got that knife? Give me it. My bodkin? No, your knife. Come on. We'll check it with my bag. It's ok. Ok. Um... Ok, how about that whip? What of it? They're not going to let you on board with that. On board what? Just give me the whip, ok? That comes to $596.36. Cash, check, or charge? Charge... I think. Excuse me. Gate 40? Sure. Just go down the hall, turn right, then through the double doors on your left. Thanks. Oh, no. The computer must be down. Timing, huh? You know, we better hurry, or we're going to miss this plane. Redferne? Come on, let's tarry not. What... these winged machines... the ones that thunder... Planes. But men travel inside them... Through the air? Men like us. Come on. Oh, no, no. Look, you... In my day, those even endeavoring to fly are accused of witchery. No, no, look yourself, ok? The book is in Boston. That means we got to beam out there and find someone who knows. My boots work best with ground beneath them. Directly beneath. What am I going to have to do here? Hold your... oh, shit. Where did you get this? The farmhouse. I know, but you're going to have to leave it here. I'll not abandon my every weapon. Look... We're going to miss our plane. Give it to me. I'll not. Look, Buster, I'm in charge of this safari now, and if I say you're going to... keep it. Keep it? Quit arguing with me and just keep it! Boston. Looks like you just made it. You're telling me. Can I take that for you? Over my rotting corpse. Family heirloom. Ah. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Like this. Get passive, huh? You can actually get some sleep here. What now? There's a witch among us. Set me free. The vane. Where did that wench put the vane? Wait. Take a minute here, huh? We're, like, 39 million feet in the air. There's no way he could be on board. Cream that spoils, a flame that burns pure blue... there's no way, Redferne. I know all the signs! Look, I know he's not here. How? How is it you're so sure? You saw him. We're after the book now. Remember? You saw him, and you told me not! We left him behind, Redferne. Look, we're halfway to Boston. He's back there beeping the X-ray machines. Forget him, ok? He's with us still. Now I'll search thither. You, thither. Keep your wits about you... Such as they are. Excuse me. Well? I cannot reason this. There is witchery afoot. I draw breath and taste it. Maybe there's another witch afoot. Could be, like, Glenda, Good Witch of the West. A good witch? Sweet dreams, Redferne. Good witch. Let me guess... California, right? How'd you know? Bear to your left. What? 'Twas Boston common we just now passed? Yeah. And we travel north on Tremont Road? Yeah, we're on Tremont. Then bear west. The church lies not far off. Think I'll keep going this way, loop around onto Cambridge. Nay, turn here. Here! Hey, look, pal, I know this town pretty good. I've lived here since 1958. How about you? Don't answer that. Lest you favor throttlings to the ears and face, bear west here. They wonder why we hate the Lakers. Pray, might we speak inside? Speak? It's important. It really is. Maybe you could come back tomorrow in the morning. Any time after 8:30 or call the church office. Regarding the Grand Grimoire. Some of the other clergy know about it, too. I'm not the only one who's seen the records, but nobody seems to recall how or why it came into church hands. Some sort of witches' book, isn't it? Can we see those records... Tonight? Church papers wouldn't be for sale... At any price. You are document collectors, isn't that it? We aren't here to buy anything. We just have to find that book. It's not here, if that's what you're hoping. It was broken up long ago and divided into... he's here. The wretch is on us like a tail on a hound. No, he's not here. He is. He's not. Can I ask what your interest is in finding such a book? Our interest lies in stopping those who would see all good falter. It lies in stopping the powers of misrule from coming of age. It lies in finding that damned book and thwarting a vile beast of a man who shall not rest until God himself is thrown down and all of creation becomes Satan's black-hell-besmeared farting hole. You asked. Here. "Chronicled in the year of the Lord "sixteen hundred ninety and two, "Township of Boston, "some few remarks upon a book most dire... "called by some the book of shadows, "by others, the Key of Solomon, "and named by others still the Grand Grimoire. " Aye, that's the one. "... the need for exquisite caution. Many-faced lieutenants of Lucifer. " Well, the language gets pretty thick, but I remember something about how the book was distributed. Like, where? Let's see, uh... "One part was placed "within the slender hollow of a table used in the taking of communion. " Chas' table. "Another part was given to a vicar "who had recently founded a ministry west of the Carolinas. " The farmhouse. "And the third part... " Yeah? Yeah? Well, if I'm reading this correctly, the third part might still be here in Boston. Oh, was this a plan or what? Ok, where? A graveyard? A burial ground... one I know. Now we're going to go dig up graves? Is that what you're trying to tell me? If luck looks upon us, there'll be no digging. For should the earth there be hallowed, then the pages lie safe. Never can no witch set foot on consecrated ground. Whose idea was this? So much has changed, yet at times, I spy a familiar stretch of park or turn of the road. Over there. Did you hear that? Hear what? I don't know. It was a soft... Sort of like... A soft... I'll say good evening... Even though it does seem unwarranted. The two who were here earlier this night... what was told them? The man Redferne. Well, we... Talked about many things. Then talk to me of pages... of pages and places most secret. Pages? I'm afraid I don't know what you're referring to. Sit you down! And let you sit, too. I feel them. Them? How could you know that? A boy child... And a girl. Both shall be born well-favored, providing he tells me what I need know. Please tell him, Stewart. Tell me, Stewart, lest your children be born slugs of cold flesh. Tell me now. How do we know if it's holy ground? We'll know. Is that good? The ground has been consecrated. Well, that's it, right? The pages are safe. Should they still be here. The pastor, he spoke of a tomb carved with a hex mark. I'll search thither, you thither. A hex mark? Aye. A hex mark. Redferne. Like this? Like this. The bolts are sound. There has been no meddling in all this while. You mean we're not going to open it? Nay. We'll leave it as we found it. Good call. Trust me. We don't want to open this unless we really... really gotta. Come on, Redferne. I think Giles is a nice name. What, you expected to live forever? Well, at least we didn't have to open it. I mean, we didn't have to stare at your putrefied corpse or anything. Uh-oh. What's the deal here? Redferne! Get back here! Redferne! They're moving graves! That sign says something about a landfill, about condos! They're moving people from this side of the graveyard to that side. And so? I had this awful thought. What if that side of the wall... Wasn't part of the real graveyard? You know, I bet you're aren't even in here. The pages maybe, but not you. Are you daft? 'Tis mine own casket. Yeah, but you're not dead. You're right here. Look, before you died, you came to the 20th century. Think of it that way. How could there be tomb and casket but I died? Guess we find out the hard way. Hey. I'll do it. Now, don't look till I say it's ok to look, ok? Just be quick about it. Well? Better not look. Is there a body inside mine own? Better not look. Can I look now? No. Better not. Oh, blessings of heaven. What'd you expect? I said better not look, and you looked. How dumb can you be? The pages... take them and hurry. Hurry! Oh, yuck. I said hurry, did I not? Doesn't hurt a bit. Just a couple more. All that remains is to see the pages back to... Hallowed ground. Redferne? Aye. I think he's here. The pages. Take off. Take off! Go! No! Come out, Redferne. Show yourself! God! Virtuous idea. Stop! What you hold for what I hold. A straight swap of goods. Your offer seems light. All will die should I give these up. The uncreation? Only the daft believe such a thing. The pages, Redferne. Give them up. No! Don't you dare! Believe it, Redferne. Her death will make all others seem like a pet tea party. And you, you who stand there cow-like on hallowed earth, shall hear every whimper, every cry, every gasping gush I can bring from her slow-dying body. See her... the mouth, the legs, the breasts. So much like those of someone once you knew, of someone both we knew. Well, Redferne, shall she live, or shall she join sweet Marion in the hereafter? Take the pages. But take them by hand. How's this? No spells, no flying, no magic. Take them, if you're able. Now who makes the hollow offer? You give up nothing. Take the pages, if you're able. So, you fear me. 'Tis I who others fear. Not you. The magic. Having waited so long, it could prove wonderfully good to linger on it. Fear... tell me how it feels. Feels as if the rules have changed. I am he of empty crib and stillborn foal. I am he whose coming the stars hath foretold. I am he with heart forged by blackest coal. I am he who makest whole the glorious goal of Satan's unborn soul! Now reveal unto me the name of God. Oh, no. No. I know thee! I know your name! I know the word that can undo all you have wrought! Yea, I know thee! Nay, nay, say it not! Try saltwater, fuckbrain. You are owed a debt greater than any we'll know, save one. From me, then, a world of thanks, Kassandra. Kassandra with a "K." Had our 2 lives been not so out of joint... Had we... What I mean to say is... Redferne. Oh. Oh. Shoot. Whoo ho! Yeow!
