Forget this asphalt... ...that every day takes us faster, further. Welcome to the world of Atlantis. The original world. A world that is magnificent, mysterious, harmonious. Man was born there. Man grew up and matured there, as a prince heir. He trained his senses in this world with no gravity... ...this world free of all chaos. The love, the tenderness, the rhythm, the grace, the spirit. Many gifts offered forever by that sea, beautiful and generous. Forget one by one the memories of our numerous generations. Forget everything you know. Dive. Dive a few million years earlier... ...when life, this wonderful idea... ...was about to become a reality.
