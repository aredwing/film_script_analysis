ROBERT: You, DanieI Defoe, are a writer. It is your destiny as such... to bring this remarkabIe man's story-- a story of intense struggIe... extraordinary friendship, and undying Iove-- to the world. Well done, well done. Full of life, death, passion. You could indeed give up publishing... for the stage, sir. Tell me, though... what relevance has this fine story... to an impoverished scribe like myself? Because, Daniel... you are my favorite impoverished scribe. And what is this? A recently-discovered journal of one Robinson Crusoe. Then this tale you tell me is true? Every word of it. A travelogue of a wayward seaman. Read this journal, Daniel. l am confident, sir, you will find a great interest... in the story he has to tell. CRUSOE: And so my story begins... Iike so many other stories, with a woman. For as Iong as I can remember... Mary McGregor and I had pIanned to marry. However, as the McGregor famiIy grew more prosperous... So, too, did the fortunes of the Crusoe famiIy dwindIe. As a resuIt, the woman whom I greatIy Ioved... found herseIf betrothed against her wiII... To my dear friend Patrick Connor. CRUSOE: Though Patrick knew of our IifeIong bond... he refused to reIease Mary from their arrangement. lt need not end this way, Patrick. How, then? Shall l cease the engagement and disgrace my family? [Both grunting] Patrick! We were friends once. Does not that count for anything? [Panting] We were friends, Crusoe. But we are friends no longer. Then we shall fight. [Grunting] [Horse neighs] [Panting] [Panting] She is to be my wife, Robin. lt is God's will. You know Mary and l loved each other since childhood. MAN: Patrick! PATRICK: This is not your fight, James. CRUSOE: You're not Iike your brothers, Patrick. Don't be like your brothers. [Gasping] [Horse neighs] PATRICK: You wiII never be together! [Grunting] JAMES: Patrick! [Gasps and grunts] No! No, no. Dear God, forgive me. [Groaning] [Gasps] [Panting] MAN: He's dead, sir. Murderer. Take to your horse, sir. l'll not leave. Go, sir, now! Murderer! Uhh. [Horse neighs] [Panting] MARY: Of course he knew I did not Iove him. l told him as much. Yet he chose to fight. You both chose to fight, Robin. What are you saying, Mary? Do you believe l would willfully kill my friend? l walked away. You accepted his challenge. Would a wiser man have known better than to fight, huh? His brothers will seek vengeance. Ah, they have already. He was my friend, Mary. l would never have wished... such a terrible fate on Patrick. MARY: You must Ieave now. It is not safe for you anymore. CRUSOE: WiII it ever be safe for me, Mary? MARY: Time wiII heaI this wound, Robin. I wiII expIain to Patrick's famiIy. They wiII come to understand. Go with the coachman. You can trust him. He wiII take you to Edinburgh... and arrange for your safe passage. Come back wiser for the experience. ln a year...l'll return. Then we shall be wed. lf it is 13 months, Robin... then shall l marry another? l love you. l will always see your face before me. CRUSOE: A year. No longer. [Coachman speaks indistinctly] [Neighs] [Chattering] [Sailor yells] CRUSOE: And so I took to the seas-- the one pIace where I knew I wouId be safe. [Sailor yells] For many months we saiIed the great oceans of the worId. We docked at mysterious scented isIands... under the Southern Cross. We swam with mermaids... and we carried fabuIous cargoes... of siIks and spices, jade and mahogany. And once, even... we carried a human cargo of sIaves. Providence had decreed me a man without a country... yet I was not without a purpose. Though I had formerIy served in His Majesty's army... it was my academic background... and my intimate knowIedge of history... that Ied the captain of our ship to caII on me... to chronicIe our journey through the written word. [Knock on door] Enter. Captain's compliments, Mr. Crusoe. Thank you. Shut the door. CRUSOE: Though Patrick's death brought about my exiIe... it was the thought of Mary, of the knowIedge... that I wouId have her hand in marriage upon my return... that kept my spirit strong as our voyage continued. [Sailors chattering] SAILOR: Aye-aye, sir. CRUSOE: Our IittIe ship had met and bested... fouI weather and high seas on 3 oceans. Sometimes the storms wouId Iast a week or more... but I grew ever more confident... in the skiIIs of our captain and his crew. [Shouts overlapping] CAPTAIN: Are ya seeing the coast, yes? SAILOR: Up ahead. Put your back into it, sir. [Grunts] [Thunder] SAILOR: CaIIing away, caIIing away. SECOND SAILOR: Aft foIIow. Batten down the hatches! Batten down the hatches! SAILOR: Aye-aye, sir. [Crew yelling] Get over here! [Captain yells] Ohh! Oh, God! [Yells] [Yelling indistinctly] Ohh! [Grunts] Oh, God. [Glass shatters] [Captain yells orders] CAPTAIN: Get out! Bring it around! Bring it around! Aah! Aah! Give me your hand! Don't be fooIish, sir! Give me your hand! Give it to me now! Give me your hand! [Both grunting] [Yelling] SAILOR: Mikey, heIp me! [Shouting and yelling] Aah! [Sailors screaming] [Grunts] Ow! [Coughs] Uhh. Uhh. Aah. [Grunting and gasping] CRUSOE: As I took my first steps... in that unknown Iand... a dread came over me. I began to reaIize in truth how terribIe was my condition. Hello! Hello! [Grunts] No! [Grunts] CRUSOE: As I Iaid my poor companions to rest... I confess my thoughts were for my own souI. I did not know in what Iand I had been cast... in what country, among what nation... nor whether I might endure a singIe night here... Iet aIone a week... or a month. I spent that first night not daring to imagine... what dangers might prowI or crawI beneath me... and sIeepIess for thinking... how I might survive the next day... without food or weapons or human company. But as the sun rose, so did my spirits... for then I saw that the huIk of our vesseI... had caught fast on the reef where she had foundered. On-board I might find food and drink for my sustenance. [Grunts] And this gave me fresh hope. Unhh. [Dog whining] Hello? ls anyone there? [Whining continues] [Arf] [Clank] CRUSOE: I found that our ship Iay so on the reef... that onIy haIf of her was fiIIed with water. The forward parts were dry... and there I found powder and weapons... and provisions. I discovered the carpenter's chest. Being a gentIeman, I had IittIe experience... with the tooIs of the trade. NevertheIess, there and then I resoIved... that I wouId Iearn. [Whimpers] CRUSOE: The ship's Ione boat... had been dashed to pieces by the storm... but I found a part of an upper deck torn away. I used this as a makeshift raft. Thanks to an incoming tide and a gentIe breeze... my modest craft took me straightaway to shore. I began to feeI not a IittIe proud... of my achievement...so far. And so I reckoned my fortunes were on the up. I had provisions for a month or more... tooIs and good timber, even good company... in the captain's oId dog Skipper. [Arf] [Arf] CRUSOE: There you go, Skipper. That's it. No more. From now on you find your own food. CRUSOE: I was now making daiIy excursions... away from the shoreIine. Penetrating further and further... into the interior of my domain. I knew onIy that we'd been saiIing some miIes... from the coast of Guinea... and I had in mind the possibiIity... that my soiI was somehow connected to a mainIand... where I may happen upon some human civiIization. [Panting] l'm on an island. CRUSOE: In order to keep watch daiIy... for the first ship that wouId pass at sea... I resoIved to situate myseIf... as near the coast as possibIe. The weeks turned to months... and stiII no sighting of a ship. But I truIy beIieved it must come to pass. Some vesseI wouId saiI by my shore... sooner rather than Iater. [Skipper barks] [Arf] [Arf] [Woof woof] [Woof] [Woof] Skipper! Quiet. Quiet, Skipper. [Skipper barks] Oh, my God. Oh. Ah. CRUSOE: HeIIo! Come back! Come back! CRUSOE: I'm here! l'm here! Come back! Fire! Fire! Fire! Come back! Please! Please! Please come back! [Yells and gasps] Come back! I'm here! [Skipper barking] [Barking] [Skipper barking] Ah, ha. [Laughing] CRUSOE: It was on that day I came to see... I must no Ionger reIy upon chance... or fate or divine intervention... for my survivaI... but soIeIy on my own efforts... as a man. CRUSOE: And I found, as time went by... I began to grow even fond of my isIand kingdom. [Chattering] [Twitters] [Chirps] I have not been idIe with my time on the isIand. Even so, my thoughts continuaIIy turn... to the Iife I Ieft behind. Skipper! Come here. What you're about to hear... is the sweetest sound in the whole world. Hmm? The spirit of Scotland. [Panting] [lnhales and plays] [Skipper barks] [Barking] [Continues playing] [Barking] [Bagpipes blurt] [Pants] [Moans] MARY: Come on, then. [Mary laughs] CRUSOE: My thoughts of Mary inspired me... for I knew that someday I wouId return. [Grunts] I erected a monument to mark my Ianding here. Upon it I've been scrupuIousIy recording... the days of the week and the months... as they've passed since my arrivaI on the isIand. [Gasps] One year, Skipper. A whole year. [Surf lapping] [Bird crying] Ho. Ha. [Grunts] [Crusoe panting] CRUSOE: How many wiId fantasies tormented my mind... as I made for the security of my own castIe... fancying every bush and tree stump to be a man... affIicted with such terror that I couId imagine... Satan himseIf had taken human shape... and Ieft his print upon my shore. [Wild yelling and ululating] [Crusoe grunting] From somewhere on my isIand came sounds I beIieved... I wouId never hear again. Human voices, to be sure... but voices unIike I had ever heard before. [Barking] Stay! Stay here! [Yelling and ululating] [Yelling and ululating continue] [Man shouts in native language] [Yells in native language] [Shouting and chanting in native language] [Hooting] [Tribe yelling and shouting] [Shouting in native language] [Yelling and shouting continue] [Victim screams] Aah! [Yelling and ululating] [Crusoe loads weapons] [Clicks] [Moans] [Panting] Don't be afraid. I'm your friend. l'm a friend. Ha. CRUSOE: Ha. [Panting] [Yells] Unhh! Give it to me. Come on. [Rattles] [Mutters] Back! [Bird squawking] What do you think you're doing?! l saved your life back there! l want to be your friend. How can l make you understand? Friend. [Deliberately] l am your friend. Food. Right. Food. Huh? Food. Food! [Grunts] CRUSOE: Here you go. A gift. Peace. [Speaks native language] [Man speaks native language] Ah, you want the gun. Oh, no. lt's very powerful. And if you try to take this... l will use this power to kill you... and l don't want to kill you! You're my friend. Food. Food. [Man shouts in native language] Hey! [Yelling] [Man speaks native language] No! Blasphemy. Blasphemy. Blasphemy. CRUSOE: How couId I ever have imagined... being a friend to this savage? I saw now he was from another worId-- one sureIy ruIed by Satan. I, Robinson Crusoe... wouId guide and protect my kingdom... against aII eviI. Skipper! Skipper! Prepare yourself. lt seems we have a very unfriendly heathen... on the island with us. [Skipper barks] CRUSOE: LittIe did this pagan know... but his adversary was once trained as a soIdier... so he wouId be facing one skiIIed in strategy... in the miIitary arts. [Ring] [Ring] CRUSOE: It is hard to describe my confIict of emotions. In aII these 2 years... I'd Ionged for the company of another human being... and now we were enemies. Hunter and prey. And he was out there-- somewhere on my isIand. Aah! Unh! [Arf] [Grunts] Sha. [Grunting] Ahh. Stay away from me, you black heathen bastard! Aah! Aish! CRUSOE: Leave it aIone. Leave the bIoody thing aIone. You hear me? That's right. Blow your bloody brains out. Go on. Come here. Give me that thing. Give me that-- That's it. Give me the gun. Give me the bloody gun! [Crusoe breathing heavily] Aye. Come here, come here. l'll give you this. Look. Look. Aye. Ha ha ha ha! [Speaking native language] Up. Up. All right, easy. Do you understand danger? Death? Who are you? Huh? What are you? Look. Look! [Fires] [Screeching] Aye. [Screeches] Aye. Aye. CRUSOE: That he was a savage was indisputabIe... and yet he seemed to be a decent feIIow at heart. In time, I might even turn him from his pagan ways. Perhaps this was my mission. What's your name? What about Hamish? l had a brother called Hamish. [Rooster crows] What day is it? Thursday? No, it's not. lt's Friday. [Squawks] Friday. Friday. Friday. Friday. Friday. Master. Master. Master. Friday. Master. Friday. [Laughs] Aye. Friday. Friday. You sleep here. You sleep... here. [Sighs] It's just untiI the morning. Food. [Bird squawks] [Skipper barks] Stay there. F-food. [Sets down] Master. Stay. Stay. Stay. Come here. Come here. [Chains rattle] [Sets down gun] CRUSOE: I had wronged this poor honest savage... and I was truIy sorry for it. It became cIear to me... that I couId not have found a better creature... to be subject to my benevoIent ruIe. At Ieast... that was how I saw it then. [Barks] [Barks] [Rooster crows] [Rooster crows] CRUSOE: Friday became constant and diIigent... in his work... and proved to know a great deaI... about pIanting and harvesting our crops. Indeed, to my surprise, he began to instruct me. In turn, I made it my mission... to teach Friday the King's EngIish. And after 6 months... I was astonished that he Iearned the Ianguage... with such great proficiency. Yet other aspects of Friday's education... proved more arduous. Friday, l have to talk to you about God. God? Your Maker. Your Creator. God. He made everything. He made you. Pokya. Pokya? Pokya God. Look at that. Huh. Before long time, no land--only water. That's in ''Genesis.'' Pokya live in the water. He make Timpopo. He make Tompopo. He make the sun and the moon. Right. Mm-hmm. Sun and moon marry. They make baby--man. Make all men. Make me. No. God made you. Pokya. You can't worship a crocodile. Why not? Teeth of crocodile. CRUSOE: Does this crocodiIe... this Pokya... tell you to eat the flesh of your enemies? Make strong. You eat fish, swim good. You eat Iizard, cIimb good. You eat heart, make strong! This is pagan blasphemy, Friday! The true God is greater and more powerful. The true God is love. He teaches us to love our enemies. Pokya... is not God. Show me God. l cannot show you God. l show you Pokya. You show God. You cannot see God. He's in the spirit. He's in the souI. l see spirit in the trees. l see spirit in fish and animals. l see everywhere. Here. Here is God. Here is the living proof of God. His sacred word. This is the living testament to His love, His wisdom... His divine plan--here. Where? l see no God. No, you--you have to read it. Now look what you've done, you heathen savage. This blasphemy and your soul... shall be damned to eternal torments. l no like your God. l no like you. Forgive all those who trespass against us-- against You, Lord. Against You. CRUSOE: I knew I shouId come to regret my harsh words. Whether Friday was the better for our meeting... I do not know, but I had good cause... to think Providence was sending him to serve me. And so, I'm aIone again. I manage weII enough without him. I eat weII enough, I Iive toIerabIy weII... but I find I begin to miss him as a companion. It's been severaI weeks now. Our paths cross from time to time... but we do not speak, do not communicate. In my studies of history... I had chronicIed the reIigious wars... that have pIagued mankind since the beginning of time... and how sad, I thought... that in this universe of two... reIigion had now put us at our own war. Yet something had to be done. Friday! [Spits] We can't carry on like this. lt's silly-- the two of us on the same bloody island... not talking to each other... not sharing what we have. l'm sorry for all the things l said... everything I did. l was angry. l apologize. l want you to come back. Good fish. Eat. CRUSOE: There she goes. That's it. Come on, come on. That's it. Come on. CRUSOE: So now we were three... and I heard once again the sound of human Iaughter-- his and mine. Come on. FRIDAY: Ha ha! CRUSOE: That's it. [Both chattering] There you go. FRIDAY: Go sideways. Sideways. Go in the water yourself. They'll go with you. Let's get the big one. Yours is bigger. FRIDAY: Winner. CRUSOE: I had not forgotten who it was... that had brought Friday to my isIand... nor the IikeIihood of their return. The Nemurs, it seemed, were the dominant tribe... on Friday's isIand... and Friday had been offered by his own peopIe... as a tribute to these savages. Powder-- gunpowder. This is it. Power. This is what the Nemurs come for? CRUSOE: This must be powerfuI. FRIDAY: Oh, make great warriors. Then we'll come back. CRUSOE: And so I determined to be ready for them. Like hunters setting traps for animaIs... we prepared our weIcome. I expIained to Friday... that this particuIar white man's magic... wouId ensure that our enemies... go to meet their god Pokya... rather sooner than they anticipated. [Horn blows] [People yelling in distance] [Horn blows] [Yelling louder] [Crowd yelling] [Drums playing] [Barking] Skipper! [Barking] Skipper! Skipper! [Yelling stops] O dear Lord... l thank you for the time l shared... with this faithful creature. He was my friend. Skipper goes to Crusoe's heaven? Dogs don't have souls, Friday. Only people have mortal souls. Only people go to heaven. Too bad. Good dog. [Softly] Aye. Friday ask Pokya... to look after dog's spirit. Pokya! Pokya-ay! [Speaking native language] CRUSOE: The Iessons of humiIity... do not come easiIy to a stubborn souI. FRIDAY: Pokya! CRUSOE: Once I had thought mine was the onIy true path. FRIDAY: Pokya! CRUSOE: Now I was no Ionger sure. FRIDAY: Pokya-ay! [Squawks] The Nemurs will come back. With new moon... many, many warriors will come. Want your magic. Mmm. Well, we can't fight them all. We could build a boat. Go away. Go to your island. No. We cannot go to my island. Why not? Cannot go. Can never go. l am a dead man. This island of dead people. Aye. Well, we will be if we stay here. We build boat. You go to your island. Mmm. lf only l could. My island's on the other side of the world... many, many moons away. What name your island? Britain-- Great Britain. Brittany. Yes. New Brittany. You know Britain? Not so long-- one moon, maybe. You mean New Britain? New Brittany. Right name, Oamockapeet. White men call it New Brittany. Have you seen white men before me? My father told me about white men long ago. Not good. White man, he take much everything... not give back. Take land, take people-- Tonga people. Make people slaves. You're not white man, Master. You're a good man. But if your island is close to New Britain... we could build a boat, and we could go there. l cannot. Do not ask me, Master. My name is not Master! My name is Robinson Crusoe. Rob-- Robina Crus-- Crusoe, aye. What name is Master? White man. l am slave to you? No. lt was a mistake. l'm not your slave! No. No, you're not my slave. We are friends, and we can live as friends... but we can build a boat. We can build a boat and leave this place! You're going to build it! [Choking] [Catches breath] You gave life. l cannot kill you... but l will kill myself! Then stay on this island and die... but l will build a boat... and l will live! CRUSOE: So, my stupid arrogance... had Iost me my dear companion for a second time... and I was aIone again. If what Friday said was true... I was Iess than one month's traveI from New Britain... one of His Majesty's coIonies... off the coast of New Guinea. But my time was short. I had to Ieave before the next fuII moon... and the typhoon season wouId soon be here. [Wind blowing] [Hammers] [Thunder] I knew I wouId have to Ieave soon... or miss my chance... if I had not aIready done so. [Thunder] How I regretted my thoughtIess words. The chances were... that I wouId never see my friend again. [Thunder] [Thunder] l am not slave! [Thunder] l know, Friday! You're my friend! [Thunder] [Thunder] l tell you my spirit name. Only spirit, me, and Tonga big men know. [Speaking native language] Why are you telling me this? Crusoe gave life. Not say more. [Thunder] [Speaking native language] Give power of bird. Fly safe to landing. [Thunder] [Thunder] [Laughs] [Speaking native language] [Laughs] [Speaking native language] Quickly! Quickly! [Thunder] [Goat bleats] CRUSOE: Fearing that this might be a tempest... as vioIent as that which cast me on the isIand... we brought our Iivestock... to what sheIter we couId devise. We waited together to brave the storm... which, indeed, proved more fearsome... than any before. [Thunder] [Thunder] [Snaps] [Animals bleating] [Animals bleating] [lnsects buzzing] No time to build new boat. Moon nearly big. Nemurs come-- many, many warriors. Yeah, well, there's no place to hide. We'll have to fight them. We may die. Dying not important. All men die. What matters is how you die. Then we'll die like warriors. [Click] CRUSOE: At the time of the Iast fuII moon... I knew that severaI of the Nemur warriors... had escaped our trap... so this time... the enemy wouId know we were there. Our onIy aIIy wouId be our ingenuity... and what gunpowder remained to us. [Men shouting in native language] [Friday speaking native language] [Whispering] Our Father, who art in heaven... hallowed be Thy name. [Friday speaking native language] Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us. And Iead us not into temptation... but deIiver us from eviI-- for thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory... forever and ever. Amen. [Whispers] [Speaking native language] [Drums playing in distance] [Men chattering, bagpipe playing] [Playing] [Chattering in native language] [Playing] [Bagpipe music stops] [Men chattering in native language] [Man speaking native language] Ahh! [Gags] Ohh! [Speaking native language] [Speaking native language] [Speaking native language] [Men speaking native language] MEN: Aah! [Speaking native language] MEN: Aah! [Men speaking native language] MEN: Aah! Uhh! Aah! [Man hits ground] CRUSOE: Uhh. Ohh! Unh! Uhh! Uhh. Uhh. CRUSOE: I do not know how Iong I had Iain there... whiIe Friday ministered to me. I feIt IittIe pain... but a coIdness spread through every Iimb. No, no, no, no. [Shivers] Uhh. l don't want to die here. [Shivering] Will you stay with me until... please, huh? Then go back to your own people. Cannot go--can never go. You must. Friday is a dead man. l cannot go back from here. l am dead to my people. l am tanwuan. This island of dead men. No one ever leave. l don't want to die here. CRUSOE: Because he was offered up for sacrifice... Friday was considered dead to his own peopIe-- In many ways, a fate worse than death... as he couId never again be accepted... amongst his own tribe. IronicaIIy, this dead man... was my onIy chance for Iife. [Labored breathing] CRUSOE: Friday. Friday. CRUSOE: Mary. Huh? MARY: Robin. Robin. Ha ha! Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary, Mary, Mary. No, no. No, no, no. No, no. You live. No. Friday take care of you. No. [Mutters] Unh! Aah! Friday... take you home. Aye, home. CRUSOE: Having neither the provisions... Nor, in my case, the strength... to aim our saiIs for New Britain... Friday and I set out for his nearby isIand. WhiIe Friday beIieved... his peopIe couId cure me of my iIIs... his own fate was far Iess certain. I couId not count the days we were on the sea. With God's grace... we encountered onIy fair winds. And with Friday as our guide... we saiIed safeIy to his isIand home. [People chattering in native language] [Crowd yelling] Friday! Friday! FRIDAY: You'II be better. She has magic leaves. Ohh. Thank you. Your wife? Netwuana. FRIDAY: Was my wife. They think l dead when Nemurs take me. FRIDAY: Not come back. She marry a new man. [Speaking native language] Ptt. [Woman speaking native language] Nabo. Am l an evil spirit? They think you are a slave trader. Ohh. FRIDAY: Many times, white men come... and take many warriors-- many young men for sIave. Take my son. Oh, Friday. They think l bring you here... to make them slaves. Ohh. [Labored breathing] lf l'm an evil spirit... why does she help me? You sick man. Not good to kill sick man. Bad mana. [Necklace rattles] [Men chanting in native language] He prays to the gods. CRUSOE: Aye. What are they saying? We fight. One of us die. lf l kill you... l can stay. lf you kill me, you can go. l cannot kill you. CRUSOE: l will not kill you. -FRlDAY: l am a dead man. -CRUSOE: Ohh! No wife, no man-child. lt's better to die like warrior. [Men chanting in native language] [Spits] [Yelling in native language] l will not fight you. You must... or they kill both of us. [Men chanting in native language] Yaah! Uhh! [Chanting] l cannot do this! Ohh! [Chanting] AImighty God... welcome me to paradise, if l am worthy. Kill me and live. l cannot kill friend. Do it! Do it. [Chanting] Aah! [Crowd stops yelling] [Yelling] Come on. Go ahead. This way. Come on. Ohh! Ohh! Ow! MAN: Come away, me hearty. These savages can't harm you now. No! No! No! [Sobs] [Crusoe sobs] CRUSOE: And so, fate had saved... her harshest trick tiII Iast. Just as a dueI had caused me to fIee my native Iand... so, too, did a battIe between friends... bring about my return. I was to owe my freedom... to the men who had kiIIed my friend... who had ravished his peopIe and his famiIy. MAN: Come on, come on, mate. CRUSOE: The sIavers nursed me back to heaIth... and then put me ashore at Lisbon. There, I was taken aboard a merchantman. from ScotIand... I came home. lt was he who gave you the journal. Yes. Robert, l--l must write this. [Taps desk] You miss him, don't you? He saved my life. He brought you back to me. A wiser man? Mmm. Perhaps. [Both laugh] Ohh. CRUSOE: And so, Mary and I settIed down to marriage... and a famiIy of our own. We were bIessed with happiness and prosperity... but... for the rest of my days... I wouId think often and Iong... of the man who'd given me the greatest gift of aII-- my Iife... when I'd aII but Iost it... and his friendship-- unto death.
