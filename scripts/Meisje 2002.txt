With the head of the enemy captain, Holofernes, she seduced and beheaded to save his besieged city. - The distance is not a problem? - Excuse me? You live outside of Brussels. It is not obvious. - I rented something in town. - Noted. - You can call the following. - Yes. STUDIO TO REN It's pathetic. Oskar, do not be ridiculous. For once, it fears nothing. You're crazy, you know? A chance on what? One million? Five million? You're not listening to me. We had a deal. It is a matter of principle is that it? - A matter of principle? - Confidence, you know? So do not fuss. A child this is not the end of the world. Obviously not for you. A small baby. Come on, stay here, stay close to me. Stops. Stop it! Forgiveness is for the room. - It's good here? - Yes! Second floor. - Sorry. Laura. - Muriel. It's there. But I have to fetch the key. A moment. You can think. My mother lived here, until recently. And you are in the area? I work as a guide at the museum. I visit. Nice. All these men watching you and must be silent. So it suits you? This is what I wanted. I take. Do you realize what you say? Do not panic. It was the company. You can build or buy a home. It's like you want. Really like you want. You listened to what I said? What do you know about the art? What are you going to go record in the city? Muriel... Cite me a painter. One. Belgian painter. - Cites in-one to see... - You loose me! Muriel, but wait. Wait! You had to be up to four hours. It's your life, Muriel, your promotion. - Where were you? - In Luke. I called, you were not there. You lost your tongue? You're just like your father. I found work in the city. A job that I like. The museum. I rented a room. With my money. I start Monday. I leave it there? I go to bed. The woman is lying parrot, his long luxuriant hair based on the sheets. Her bare white body stands the dark green atmosphere of the scene. His attitude, the voluptuous chest, hips facing the viewer and the presence of the first color Plan evoke a harem girl. It offers... You sleep already? She was already asleep. Oskar? This is me. I do not understand why are you doing the head. I'm not pregnant after all. Call me back. Hi Mom! Why is it going so strong? Where is Oskar? - It makes you hello. - And a kiss? But yes, of course. Well, that's it. I will restyle you, they are dishes. This will certainly not be twins. Are you eating enough? But yes. Not too much, huh. I have to file later. The girl just rent the room... No, Laura, I do not want. Mom... It's just waiting for you to come. I need money. It will still not sleep in my bed! On my mattress? Well, it begins. Vincent: "I want you to take me on a remote island. " Irene:"This is not the time. " "Then when?" Vincent. Sorry, I did not have time. I put in speed and it will not bother you any more All these clothes! My mother had a dress for every man. It was really amazing. It was all crazy Oskar, my boyfriend. Finally, my friend... She wanted as I am pregnant... I told him that this was the case. I told him I was pregnant. But I ramble... And your mom, she is healthy? I live alone for a while. Good. The... You can use the dishes. The shower is down the hall. You can use you too. And you bring who you want at home. But not in my shower! - Come on... It's going to be okay? - Yes. Okay, so I leave you. Muriel, this is your mother. Sorry, I have given your number. Hi, Mom. Well. Yes, the room was good. Yes, the owner. Yes. I can not stay, I'm in the hallway. I went to bed, I start tomorrow. Yes. OK. Yes. Good night. You think it's normal? No explanation, no apology, nothing. This morning, she ran as a thief to avoid having to talk to us. You told him you. I do not know. It has the job she wanted. She said nothing else? Not. Unless you deserved this promotion. You had worked hard for it. That's what she said. Hey, doll, all right? We saw 14 candidates. That's a lot. And I'm sorry, but you are not accepted. Bye. Listen, I can not help you. The other positions are for men. I'll see what I can do. So we see that the artist wanted to make a study of the female body. It is clearly seen he was in love with his models. He had about their bodies intimately. So he must have three mistresses... I would like you paint me. Oh yeah? Come, go to the next. - How much? - Thirty-five. Thank you. - That's it. Thank you very much. - Thank you. Otherwise, wait 20 minutes. I go with Oskar. Then we go together. OK? Then, and your day? Full of Japanese? Ah, that Oskar. Continued without me. I'll join you. OK? Oskar? - We need to talk. - Ben talks. I'm serious. This pregnancy was also your idea. To your mother, Laura. An invention to fit instantly. Just a joke. A joke? For you, maybe. I do not want kids. Not now, not ever. I do. I am 36 years old, Oskar. I need to advance in life. We had a contract, and you know it. - So what? - What comes next? I do not want to make love thinking we might have a kid. So you know what? You just have to make you a monk. Let's go carousing. What is your gender? Let's go see these guys. Come on. Say, this is the new fashion? - Who? - What? Being taciturn! - You drink something? - A whiskey on ice. - It also. - It also? Two whiskeys on ice. It's fun to be here with you. Usually I do crunches for the barrel girls. But it's not bad. Where are you going? Laura! Need to talk, open the door. You answer me or what? Sorry, I thought... My name is Oskar. Muriel. You were with her yesterday, right? - You know where she is? - No. I have not heard today. When she comes back, tell him I'm waiting to snack in front. You will catch cold. - Bye. - Bye. Muriel, thank you. Here's Alain. Muriel, my neighbor. Yes? I'll see Oskar opposite. What up? Why do not you open? There was one? Yes. He remained sleeping. Fuck, that's the word, Laura. I want to move forward in life. Forward? Try men until they make you a child? Every day another... Each week something else. CD, a singing career, Chosen God. Choose! It gives you good morning. You're not gonna call every day because it has the phone? - They almost shit inside. - Yes. She has her own life, Martha. And we, ours. I thought... For this promotion.

It is no longer young, Muriel. Me too, I've got to put myself, right? Yeah... You have not seen these photos? Those of the move, with Oskar. I give up - What are you doing here? - Your mother told me you were working here - You must not come here. - I paid to see you. I've waited long enough. Not a letter, not a phone call. You do not give news. - We need to talk. - Not here. - Where, then? - Nowhere. I'm working. - After then. - No, I have an appointment. - After your appointment. - Shh. Come on. Muriel, I do not understand you. But there is nothing to understand. I just do what I want. You just do what you want? Sit in a man's suit. - This is great. Really. - I prefer you to go. Muriel, I thought and I admit that I was wrong. I know I want it all too fast. I told my father that I wanted not take over the business. What do I care? Ben, I love you, want. Nobody understands you. Person. Neither your mother nor me. - Here, you have no friends, nothing... - Oh no? And what do you know? Some, perhaps.

I found friendly. Mom? Do not you find me dull? Since you're in town you're a little pale. I have always been tasteless. And lean. I feel so ugly. You're beautiful. All mothers say it their children.
