Thanks, Brother Cheong. Work hard. Of course. No problem. Yes. What is it? Have I ever failed? You are right. We can run a great business... with this renovation company for sure. You seem so happy. We will have a hard life. We have not gone out since Faye is my friend since I was young. It is possible that... the worst thing in his life was being my friend. He was discharged three years earlier than me. We were hitmen in the gang. Thought we could have a good life. Being head of a gang, it was kind of cool. Dining, drinking, having a good time... Eventually, we suddenly realized... we had lost our directions. In fact, I am now good for nothing. I moved here to start a new life. The most important thing in my life now My biggest dream is to... see them graduate from university. Excuse me. What? Queue up. Didn't your teachers teach you? Are you dumb? Do you know who is my Big Brother? MP3! Have you heard of him? Can you hear me? Stop! Bastard! I am talking to you, bastard! Stand still! I ask you! What are you looking at? Let's go! Haven't you seen this before? Leave now. Or you want to wait for the cops? So much blood! They were cruel. They must be Johnny's followers. Those areas are his turf, Don't talk about Johnny or Danny. I don't want to know, and I don't want to bother. You too. I got it. Right, remind me on Monday... Okay. Monday. It is the first day your sisters go to school. How can I forget that? Damn!

Damn! Okay... No water now... Go clean the car! Brother, good morning. You get up so early. Are you preparing breakfast? Yes. No! What? You are putting in salt. Isn't it sugar? It's salt. Try it salty then. But I saw you put in evaporated milk. You handle this. Come on... Get up now. Why don't you wake up? Don't sleep any more. Stop it... I still have time. Get up and eat breakfast! I don't want to have breakfast. You have to! This is the first time... for your brother... Brother, why are you stuttering? It is not funny at all. Eat now... Brother. It is a meat cake.

Marble... is getting thinner recently. I wonder if you could prepare him Okay. Though I am not his mother, I won't mistreat him. I put some money on the television set. I got it. Fine. Is there anything you forget before you hang up? What is it? If you don't do this, Okay, see you tonight. That's it. Bye. You still haven't paid my money back. Yoyo, can I pay back later? Talk to you tonight. Time's up! Stop... What do you want? Speak up. Iced lemon tea, less sugar. Iced coffee. Great. What do you want? What are you up to? We were punctual in prison. We get used to it. Why don't you get back then? It's different. Now... I can smoke and pee whenever I want. Yes, sir! Yes, sir! What do you want to eat? Tell Inspector Faye. Inspector Faye will get it. Stop now. What is it? Receipts. How can you confuse "one" with "dozen"? Why didn't you study hard when you were young? How could I study hard? I was one of your gang member in the old days. But how can you confuse "one" with "dozen"? You don't study when you are young. Where did you learn that? Playboy. Playboy. Get back to work now. Let us go and have high tea. I'll pay. Ok? Give me one hundred. Press ups, Old rules. Hurry up. Be fair! Can't be fair... to everybody. One must be honest. I can't complain Sometimes I am happy. But sometimes I fall... Waste of time! I haven't finished my homework. You, you... You and you. Have you drunk today? Come on. What are you doing? Don't tell our brother when you go back. What can't I tell? I give you this one. Please don't tell him. Thank you brother. Thank you sister. Thank you Mulatto. Bye. Bye... I have been discharged for two months already. I don't want to revisit my past. I am not scared. I am just not used to it. This world is so strange to me. Sometimes, I even suspect that... what I see is not real. Uncle Bo. Neil, why are you avoiding me? No, I am not... Please don't say that. Now I am running a small business with my friends. That's why I don't have time to visit you. Try some. Two more please. I still want some more. You have good appetite. Right. You know... since your big brother Ming died, I became a vegetarian. I have been a vegetarian for the past 8 years But recently I feel bored to be a vegetarian. Seems like my body is not well. After a bowl of frog congee, I feel much better. That's great. Does it taste the same as before? As before? I am old now. An old man already. If we have a fight now, who will win? No matter what, you must be the winner. Don't make fun of me. You were my right hand man in the old days. If not for Ming, how could the cops catch you? We know in our hearts... who are good and who are not. You know Johnny, right? Tseung Kwan O is his turf now, He wants Kwun Tong as well. Recently, he is very close I think he wants to take over Hong Kong. I would like you to take charge of Kowloon East. Don't let Johnny get everything. Uncle Bo. It's now 2007. To be honest, I want to have my life simple. I don't want to get involved with any turf war You can't only think of yourself. Bro Chili. She is Mabel. Enjoy yourself. Yoyo, aren't we going to talk about your debt? It's only a trivial matter. I don't have 80,000 dollars to pay you back. We are talking about 200,000 now. You have to pay for the interests. If it was my money, it would be easier But it is the company's money. We have to follow the rules. Just pay back some interests first. Please don't be so mean. I promise I will pay you back next Monday. Next Monday you will have to pay me 300,000. If you can't find me here, you can call Chili. Yoyo... Dragon! Is there any good deal... you want to leave me out of? You're Johnny's girlfriend. You can have whatever you want. Just now, I saw Uncle Bo talking with someone... Neil, just out of prison. Damn it! Neil? Tell him to get lost, or... I will nail him. Johnny, be careful. Don't mess with Uncle Bo. The old fool must be planning something. Maybe he is looking for someone... to knock you off Kowloon East. Kun... Are you okay, Kun? Ben, take him to the back alley, and ask the police to deal with him. Yes. What happened? What happened? Marble. This... playground belongs to us. What? We have booked already. Booked? I book it now! Fight back! Asshole! What? What are you looking at? My big brother has booked this playground. You want to play soccer here? Asshole! Still looking? Get lost. Can't you see that I am watching the match? Don't you believe I will beat you? Leave me alone. Who are you? I am Neil's sister. Hot shot... then? Of course. Only those who are cool can talk to me. How about me? Treat me to tea, then we can talk. Are you picking me up now? Can't I? Okay. Marble, why don't you go and take the seats? Go. It's getting late now. Let's go home. Bonnie. My parents said after the HKCEE... they will send me abroad. Will you come back? Of course, I will. For you... Since I will miss you so much. Me too. Brother. What are you doing? I'd better go now. Are you in a hurry? No, I am not... Come with me. Eat now... You don't want to eat? How can you eat... if you sit there? Yes... Eat now. How long have you been staying with Bonnie? How long? Brother, are you questioning me? Is it bothering you? Right. Let's eat.

Why didn't you mention about Is it bothering you? Let me give you some tissue paper, What's it? Isn't it cool? I didn't even have to pay a penny. Cool? Since it was free? You have it all over your body. I got only one. Are you jealous? What are you talking about? Brother... Shut up! Listen to me, get it off immediately. Lots of people have it now. Why don't you ask them to get rid of it? Open the door! Let me do it... It is me. You are... A new friend. To meet the family? You are handsome... I wonder... did you draw the tattoo on her leg? What? It's pretty! When did you have it? What are you talking about? Pretty? That sounds right... For a kid, the most important thing Or you will end up like me when you grow up. You will be a fool. What are you talking here? Don't use foul language at my place. But you are the one who taught me this. Let me get the chopsticks. Stop! Stop! Pay my debt! Stand still! Bitch! Sorry... Get lost! Do you know her? No. Start work. Get lost if you don't know her! Still looking? You should learn to pay you debt. I will beat you up if you keep on looking! No money? Call your husband.

All these years, I have done so much for our gang. Did I haggle over money with you? How can you ask Neil to mess with me? Why are you so mad? Aren't we on the same side? I stop playing mahjong and talk with you now. Okay? Johnny, I do recommend Neil. If you feel sick, go see a doctor. Yes, I do feel sick. Mind your own business! Old man, listen... your ways won't work now. Tell me, can the gang survive without me? Johnny, don't act like a child! If you like, you may have a talk See if anyone will support you. And let me answer your question just now. No one is more important than the gang. Let's see when you will die. Choi, pick up the mahjong tiles. We have to close the door to play mahjong now. How many rounds do we still have? The Reformative School What happened? Where is your turf now? Who have you been seeing? Do you know Benny is my boyfriend? Really? Are you Vicky? That's right. Breast implants! Bitch! Do you think you have a good figure? Get lost! Your boyfriend came after me. I did not seduce him. I warn you. Stay away from him. Can you hear me? Do you want to be beaten?

How about a chopper next time! This is how her family affects her. Your younger sister copies you. What? Don't you recognize me? Neil, you are discharged for a month already. Why don't you take care of your sisters? Though your parents didn't teach you you still have to teach them to behave. I warn you... you are now an ex-convict. Behave yourself. If you commit any felony, I won't let you harm anybody. Sir, can I leave now? You may leave now. Bonnie. I can't see you again. My dad asked me to drop out immediately. And return to Australia next week. What? Can you understand? Do you read? Thank you. You are lucky this time. They are not going to sue your sister. Do you understand how difficult... it is to reform oneself? Bonnie, Barbie, let's go. Sorry, Mr. Shek. I am Miss Watt. In fact, they don't want... something like that to happen. They must be traumatised. If you don't mind, I will take them home. In the mean time, I'll visit your home. Since our parents died, we only have each other. When my big brother was sent to prison, the Social Welfare Department nearly put us But our big brother protested. He promised us that... he will never get back to his old ways He even told us to study hard. Don't think that much. It's late already. Go to sleep now. If you need anything, call me. Sleep now. Thank you. Miss Watt. I want to talk about your two sisters. In our school, we have lots of problem students. Most of them come from... broken families. You know, I was in jail for 8 years. I really don't know how to teach them. I don't worry about Bonnie, but Barbie. I really don't know how to teach her. She will be put in a girls' home sooner or later. I want to ask you if it is true that... no matter how hard we tried... we still could not be accepted as good citizens? No matter what... I will never give them up. I promised my parents to take good care of them. In fact, it's not that difficult. You can spend more time with them. And help them. I believe you can do it. I'll support you. Thank you. You have to pay back your debt. Chili, I will tell Yoyo myself. She is upstairs. Come with me. No. Let me make a call first... Chili... Chili, where are you taking me? Come on. Mabel! Yoyo. What?

I am just passing by, Inspector Cheung. Of course you are just passing by. Is this street yours? Maybe you should ask him. Johnny, do you know how thick is your file? Do you want me to arrest you? Inspector, what is wrong? My buddies are being checked. But we are so cooperative with the police. In the mean time... I bumped into Neil. You know, Neil was an ex-convict. We are looking forward to have a social gathering. Where are you going? Neil. Home. Let me go with you. Inspector, bye. Go. Go now. Take your hand off me. Johnny. You really want to take me home? Or you want to talk to me? You have never been my friend. You are my idol. Idol? Don't make fun of me. I lived in the estate and played football Those days, whenever I saw you. You looked supper-cool. I wanted to be like you. Now... I succeeded. My parents died when I was eight. Since I was short and looked like a mulatto I used to be beaten up on the street. Just like rats. Luckily. I met a good mafia boss who... gave me a chopper to kill them all. From then on... No one dares to challenge me. Up till now, I haven't lost once. I am better than you. You can scare the shit out of people You can scare the shit out of people But what about forty? What if you have your own kids? We are different. You have two sisters. I am an orphan. I have over one thousand men. Give each of them a chopper, then. Johnny, what is on your mind? Why are you still going down this dead end? Are there any problems? No, I don't see any problem. Be a boss of the gang then. What happened? Boss? What happened? Boss? The number you have dialled Please call later. Chili. Be smart. I am scared. What are you scared of? Do you want to be ravished like your stepmother? What are you talking about? Benny, what a coincidence. Are you playing video games with Marble here? Take me with you. Go away. You can't join us. Go to hell! What happened to Sister Mabel? Your stepmother was ravished by Johnny. You have arrived? I'll meet you at the front door. Later, you go inside with him. And put the bag in the green garbage box. In the green garbage box? Will it be taken away? Our man will come and get it He has come out. The one with a black shirt. Go with him. Go. Be quick. Kid, stand still! What are you doing? Stand still. Where are you going? What is in your backpack? Nothing. Damn it! He will tell the police about us. We are in great trouble. Johnny will kill us all. What should we do? No... Nothing... Nothing? Why are you so frightened then? Nothing. What is this? It is not mine. He will tell the police about us! Damn it! We are doomed! I'll go and cut him down!

Do you feel high? Take it all... Sit down Is Neil here? What are you doing? Why do you do this to me? Come on. Why did you come? I couldn't find you in your place. Sorry. My men were so careless. They injured your friends accidentally. Are you trying to hurt me accidentally now? Fuck you. Johnny, fuck you. Can you hear me? I have no intention take your place. But if you do anything to hurt my friends again... Are you scared? So called Big Brother... Do you see that? Are you okay? Of course. I am strong. Be smarter next time. If anyone barges in, draw down the gate. What if they barge in altogether They draw down the gates, not me. Do you have a cigarette? You are not nuts, are you? How can you smoke in the hospital? There must be a smoking area. I have thought about it. After you get out of hospital... we will simply close down the renovation company. What do you think? I am thinking, after I get out of hospital... I'll travel abroad. Are you smoking? Stop smoking now. Didn't you swallow it down? It's not what I wanted. I have asked you to quit smoking. I just... want to be like you. How is your son? Not yet out of danger. Why are you here? That bastard Johnny. Why didn't the cops arrest him? Cops? He had people to cover for him. Do you think they can put him behind bars? What should we do? Leave him alone? The first place. Really? Let's sign our names... quick! Bonnie! Barbie! Get lost! What are you doing?

Come on! What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't move! Sorry, sir. They are friends. These days, I have been watching TV. It is a foreign TV drama series. All the villagers have super human powers. It said, in fact, all of us have it... but we need a scientist... to incite our super human powers. You know, I haven't gone to school. I am dumb. That's why I believe we have super human powers. It's interesting. Some of the characters Some can get things from a distance Some can even become invisible. Do you believe it? I like the invisible men most. Then I can watch women bathing. Don't you think it is awesome? If we are strong... nobody will bully us. Sorry, buddy. Where are you going? Neil? Looks like your sisters are being taken away. Tonight the old fools will elect a new boss. You know what you should do. If you do harm to my sisters... I will kill you! What did they say? What? Car keys. Let me drive you there. Dear uncles, let us vote. Uncle Man, Uncle Cheng, please. Today we are here to elect a new boss As in the past, we have to elect someone and who can lead our gang. Don't elect the most ferocious, or the richest, or the one with most men. He who is ferocious may not respect us. He who is richest, even if he gives you money... may take them away from you. Uncle Bo, you really talked well. You can be a famous DJ. Johnny, don't be rude! Oh! I should be silent even Uncle Bo, why don't you tell them straight away... don't vote for me! I can't control an election. I believe we all know Right, Uncle Bo, let's vote now. Damn it! A corrupt election. Uncle Bo, listen... most of the people here will vote for me... Since I am the most powerful person in the gang. Be quick... Uncle Bo. Great, let's announce the results. Johnny. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Uncle Bo. Neil, what's wrong? Stop voting now. How can I... be the boss? I am not qualified... Thanks for your votes. Even if I am elected, I will still quit. Neil, what's the problem? Tell us, let us work it out for you. I am a coward now. Don't want to get involved with the gang. Uncle Cheng. Damn! Sober up! Asshole! Sober up! You really are a piece of shit. Did you see that? Learnt something? What's it now? Am I going to be elected uncontested? Uncle Man. I have not forced them to vote for me... You can see it for yourself. Uncle Bo. Do you have any objections? You are good. Don't praise me. I will become conceited. And... I am not good, but you are such an idiot. Let's go! Uncle Bo, what did he say? He said I am an idiot. How can you bear with him? Why not? Let him be conceited... Then he will soon meet with his downfall. Your sisters are locked up in the Shipyard. Drive faster. Barbie. Wake up. Bonnie... How are they? Miss Watt... please hold her. Sit down. Sit down. Barbie... Don't cry! I hold myself responsible for this. Let me come with you. Damn you! Nuts! Come on. Didn't you say the one Come on! Asshole! Damn you! I have told you that you are a piece of shit. This time... you will be jailed for life. I only want to be a good citizen. A good citizen? In your next life. Stay calm! Don't move! Are you nuts? You are a cop! You should help maintain order and turn over But did you help me for once? Asshole! Neil, calm down. I am very calm. My father was a gangster too. That's why I had been a gangster since I was young. I only knew people from the gangs, But now I only want to be a good citizen. Why didn't you give me a chance? Why! Calm down. Does it worth it? Think about it... you still have two sisters.
