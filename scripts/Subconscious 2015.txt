Are you all right? Are you okay? Vicki. Vick. Vick. Vick? Vick? - What the fuck? - She's dead. What the fuck? We did everything we where supposed to do. What the fuck? Pete, what the fuck? Now what? What are we still doing here? Yes, Garmin. Why are we still here? Huh? What is this? We are down here Because of your fucking obsession. - Mike ... - Look at me. Here, all your actions ... - In all its glory. - Mike ... What, Stace? Huh? You want to die? So your grandfather can keep all the glory and be a hero? Will we all heroes? You know something? I just want out of esta tin before we all die. Garmin, am you can lend a hand with it? Please? We have to lift it. Delicately. Fuck you, Pete. Peter, is not ... Mikey is right. It's my fault. My fault you're here. It's my fault Mikey's here. It's my fault ... Vicki is dead. Everything is my fault. Are you happy, Grandpa? Did you enjoy it? What are we doing here? We Moved away more and more. There must be something here to tell us what to do now. So I find him. Do I Find It? Fuck you. You know that. You tell us. Listen, DOD needs me to be here. So enough question. A Peter was not given access on board Until tonight. You Knew. You Knew esta was coming, and did not tell us. He Could not. - I was following orders ... - Fuck you and your orders. Damn. You could at Least Have alerted us. I Could not Get Involved, right? I Could have changed the outcome. Oh, dear, why do you keep saying "result"? Damn. What do you mean by "outcome"? I do not know ... but I'll find out. A submarine is not a good place to keep secrets, Garmin. All right. You want answers? You CAN HAVE them, okay. Yes, you ordered me to observe, document and report, Understand? And do not get Involved. Yeah yeah. I think That So far as I Understood your plan. Observe, document, report not Involved. Is there anything more after we fuck with your precious government plan? I was supposed to be here, okay? I had no idea ... They Knew and did not tell me. It sucks Being on the other end, is not it? Happy? It sucks, right. But i know that it was Necessary, yes? If I Knew That I must be here alone, Well, I could ... I Could do something. I Could do nothing. So either way, it's better to let things happen so the story does not change. This ... This is too critical. - What's so critical? - Think about it. Lionfish crew would report tomorrow. Are we the crew of Lionfish in 1943? We did not know any of the details. All we know is That it Happened and we know the result. It is too late. We Already helped. And changed the rules. You changed history. Are you serious? Is this why are we here? Sorry, I will not be waiting to die down here. I will not leave everything to fate. I'm going to tell Peter. No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. Peter can not know. We must make sure to do Have you done whatever the first time. Listen, this is critical, right? Peter May not be aware of any of this. We have to assume That Happened so far has everything for a reason. How do you know I did not tell ya? We do not know. But ... That suicide believe Grandpa Peter is part of the catalyst That prompts Peter to come here. It would be much Easier if Peter Knew. You can not know. Believe me, can not know. Well, I do not know how anyone Could make him do anything. It is totally furious. We have to convinces him. Listen, I have to finish this. I have not Heard a single day in your life, Why do you think it was going to start now? Well, today would be a damn good day to start. All right. You better be right. I am. What are we doing? We have a mission. Yes. A suicide mission, right? Is it a suicide or a sacrifice? Your Grandfather Knew everything ... what Happened today. With what you know it, Do you Agree That your staff profile? Do Not. - No. - No. You're right, honey. That does not match your staff profile. You're right. It really does not match your profile. All right. Let's find a way out of esta damn boat, right? Are you ready? Come over. Damn, I love you. I know. We Will. Walking. Okay, folks. Do you two know, but we have no intention of dying down here in the dark, en esta old pig. There is something here That We Have overlooked. So let's dig again and find the answer. Roger That? Garmin, feel free. OK. Wait, wait, wait. What? What did you find? Apparently, Lionfish was Attacked by His Own task force. Really? I thought I already was clear. They thought throwing They Were German submarine depth charges. So They think they're the Germans. - Yes. - And They Will not stop bombarding - Until we're dead. - Yup. Well, can not we talk radio or something, - And tell them That we are Americans? - Yeah, I wish it Were That Easy. - The Radio does not work esta depth. - Wait, wait. Like we can Communicate with them yet. Well, how? An old trick of submariners. Firing a load of water-through the torpedo tube Filled With bacon grease, oil, meat offal, trash, uniforms, jackets. Anything above deceive the enemy and make them believe They Were dead. But that's not what we do. Is not it? Do Not. We want you to know That we are alive. We want you to know That we are Americans. How do we do that? State of the art. Ok. The flag ... let me check this. That goes. It is good. No need to put that in there. The tablets do not go. - Peter. - You know what? Take ... - Peter. - Yup? Your tablets. Yeah, what about my tablets? Put them in the box. What do you say, are you crazy? - No, have all my research. - Peter, I think you need to hear. We have enough things. Close it. Hey, is not open to discussion. You can not be serious. Why the hell would want my tablets? You can not send future technology of the past. Mike, and to help. They will not go. Put them in the box. That is rubbish. I do not take your orders. Peter, listen. Really? Put your tablets in the box now. Really? Garmin, what are you doing? Put them in the box. Garmin, what do you do? Put your tablets in the box. Peter, I ... What? I think you need to trust That I knows what I's doing. Rely on the guy with the gun pointed at my chest? Show him the letter. He needs to know. I need to know why? Please, someone tell me what the hell is going on. - What? - Garmin, show him the letter. Is your grandfather left the note. "Dear Mr. Williams, our situation, the situation of our country, you've Become urgent. And I must resist.
