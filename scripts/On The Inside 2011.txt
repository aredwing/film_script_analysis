Okay, just take the car and you go home. No, I don't know if I can drive. Get in and you go, all right? What are you gonna do? Did he do the things you said he did to you? Huh? Did he make you say those things? Yeah. Go on. Drive. Drive! Hey. The guy you killed... It wasn't him. It was the guy he worked with. That's the one your girlfriend says raped her. He's got a record for assault anyway. Unlike the guy you killed, who never did anything wrong in his whole life. Do you even get what I'm trying to tell ya? You killed the wrong guy. A subtitle made possible by R3VOLV3R. Your Honor, there's more that needs to be considered here. He put himself through school, became a teacher. Allen's lived a decent, honest life despite his childhood. You've seen the psychiatric reports. Allen Meneric is a very dangerous man. Our examiner said the crime scene was one of the worst she's even seen. I don't care about his childhood. Mr. Meneric needs to be evaluated. I'm sending him to Northwood. You are now a resident of Northwood State Secure Treatment Facility... A secure, multilevel treatment facility since 1962. You're here either because you have been found incompetent to stand trial, not guilty by reason of insanity, or you're undergoing a forensic evaluation, as in the case of some of our visitors up from the state jails and penitentiary. Some of you are only with us for the time being because somebody here wants to write a paper on your particular psychological type. It does not matter. Whatever your reason for being here or the length of your stay, all residents of Northwood will be treated equally and are expected to strictly abide by its rules. I just wanted to do whatever you... Come on in, gentlemen. All right, let's open those mouths... wide. Lift the tongues. All right, now lift the scrotums. In an effort to instill pro-social behaviors that will result in greater privileges. - Now spin around... - And possibly an earlier release, all residents are responsible for the clean, attractive, and safe maintenance of their clothing, living quarters, and personal hygiene. Good morning. All medications and counseling issues will be addressed at your regular psychiatric evaluations and are not matters applicable to the general staff. We have nothing to do with you getting more or less meds. Let's work together to make Northwood a comfortable and healthy environment for everyone. - Nathan. - Tom. - You don't have your... - You wanna see my I.D.? - Well, I'm supposed to. - It's okay. This is max in here. Can I help you? Paris... a city of cultural diversity. - Can I change the channel? - From museums to nightlife, Paris offers something for everyone. Yeah. On a short train ride to the country... Why should I watch people take some fancy trip to someplace I'll never go? Got the tables back in the courtyard. Yeah. Who's this guy? Allen Meneric. College art professor. So he should be right at home in arts and crafts. Ben Marshall's out of restraints. Yeah, but the guy he got after is still in the infirmary. Anybody ever figure out how the guy - made it over there in the first place? - No. The blue group. Yeah, you leave, everything changes. - Two weeks. - 11 days. I didn't even know if you were coming back. What kind of sandwich you got? Tongue. What did you say? I asked you what you were eating. No, no. After that. What did you say? Tongue? Is that what you said? Yeah. No, that's good. That's very funny. You're, like, a joker? I'm a lunatic just like you. I'm not a lunatic. Okay. - I'm not. - Yeah, I said okay. Well, I know you said okay, but I'm still not. You're here under intense protective custody because of your passion for chicken loaf, right? Okay. For one thing, that proves you were lying to me when you asked me about what I was eating. For another thing, just because I am here under intense protective custody all right... does not mean necessarily that I am a lunatic like you are. So, what are you? Are you, um, schizoid? Paranoid? Well, if I wasn't, I will be. Never mind, okay? Nice talking to you. It is nice talking to me. I'll talk to you. What the fuck? I'm not shy, but you probably know that. You got the paper on me. But you're not gonna understand me, if that's what this is about. No. But I'll cooperate. So what, hmm? You want me to talk about my little childhood? I cracked my head open. Yeah, they thought I was gonna die when I was seven. And I killed my dad when I was 14. You wanna hear about that? Yeah. He was on the sofa and I went out back. Got this nice metal pipe, and then I smashed his hand with it. Then I smashed the other one. He put those hands on me. Well, not at this point. I suppose, at this point, I was no longer appealing. But here I am. I'm talking. So you can call me a psychopath or sociopath or whatever kind of "path" you want. Unless you kill me, I should get some privileges. I'm cooperating. I'm cooperating. Use of food to encourage pests is prohibited. Rodents are carriers of diseases. They're not meant to be played with. That's the women's section over there. You can't see it, but I thought that's where you were looking. Minimum security, that's over that way. Now they know how to live. - You know all these places? - Yeah. I know where everything and everybody is. It's my thing. Why are you here? Oh, well... Heh. Want my full case history there, Doctor? - I'm listening here. - Are you? I suppose you could say I have a problem with women. I suppose you could say somewhere that I... Uh, hate them. It's a glandular problem. There's been a few non-women related problems, too. Mia? I'm putting you on laundry duty, so you'll be starting that tomorrow. Are you helping with the menu? - What are you doing there? - I don't know. What does that mean? I have to tell you something. I can't... You can't what? I can't deal with any of this anymore. Tomorrow, I will have been in here for two years. You will deal with it, Mia. You may deal with it badly, but you will deal with it. Mia, do you know about the visits that some of the girls make on Thursdays? It's very controlled, it's very safe. Oh, no, no. No. Okay. But it's a way to open up your world a bit. And you know you have to start to look more outward. You're gonna be leaving us at some point, and we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we didn't prepare you for that. Okay? Mrs. Standings... You will always do what you want. Always, Mia. And I'm hearing that you're upset, okay? Mia, some of the girls have left a bit of a mess there. Would you straighten that up for me, please? Uh, yeah. Are we friends now? No. Okay. That's... Sure. Yep. Okay. No, man. Hey, man. Yeah. Yeah... You know, you started it. You talked to me. You started at me. - Joker. - Shh. Hey. - Just... you chill. - No, you chill. - What's your name? - Ben. No, you. Who are you? I'm Allen. I'm a killer. That's why I'm here. All right? I'm nobody's friend. Okay. Never mind. I got plenty of friends... Anyway. Bob and Isaac. Well, I can't count Isaac 'cause only Bob sees him, but... There's Bob. Come on in, gentlemen. Interesting guy. I'm going where they keep the sickest people in the world. It's all psychiatric criminals. Pomeroy said it was "unfair" for him to get 15 years in prison for raping me and you get sent to a hospital. What are you talking about? He made a statement before his sentencing. So did I. You made a speech? Yes. After the transfer, it's gonna be like a 10-hour drive. I don't want you to feel like you have to visit me. You don't have anyone else to visit you. Let me put it this way. I don't want you to visit me. Look where I am. I'm Tom Bogotus. Allen Meneric. I looked at your file. - Okay. - Look, it's standard. I'm gonna watch you for a while. But you've got those extenuating circumstances with your crime and I'm thinking you might be able to get moved. Well, you're the professional. Yeah, I am. I've been here nine years. What was it that you wanted from me? I want you to know that if you keep your thing together around here, you might be able to get yourself transferred some place a little more evolved. You wouldn't have to wear restraints every day. What if I like the restraints? The fact that you even make a joke like that indicates to me that you shouldn't be in max. You can tell that? Do you understand that what you did was wrong? Is that enough? All right. Look, I said what I said. You go for your interview in front of the board, I'll make my recommendations, and they'll put you where they think you oughta be. All right, listen up. Ben Marshall, Carl Tarses, and Allen Meneric, you guys are Arts and Crafts today. Jim Holliday and Anthony Chessman are Physical Therapy. And everyone else is Reading Skills. This is my house. And I can smell what you are. And that shit don't run in my house. You got any questions? Get in. I'm gonna have to find the time to put a hurt on that old boy, huh? I'm sure he's scared to death. Yeah. He oughta be. Why are you so... I'm sorry? Um, nothing. No, no. Finish your sentence. Never mind. Never mind? No, no, no, no, no. - I don't care how batshit crazy you... - I'm not crazy. Let's be really clear. I have a condition. I have a glandular condition. And I will bite your nose off your fucking face. What makes me so what? Hard to get along with. What's the matter? You don't like me? Ah, I like you. I'd like you even more if you didn't, you know, try to get to me. I apologize. I'm a mean bastard. I'm Carl Tarses. Who's "Eyeballs" over here? That's Allen. He's a murderer. Oh. What about you? Do you like me? I think you're the salt of the earth. I'm a bloodthirsty killer like yourself, huh? Yeah, we should organize a club or something. Who'd you kill? Careful, Allen. I asked you something. I don't know if you heard me. I'm not gonna do this with you. Oh, I think you will. I thought they had you working nights. Aw, man. Nights, days... All kinds of hours. I'm gonna end up like one of these guys in a minute. Yeah, I missed ya. Great. - Hey, what's up? - Welcome back, man. Thanks. Hey, uh, are you gonna take that courthouse job? Yeah, well, first I have to find out if I passed the test. Ben? - Ben! - Forget it. He's gone. I don't think he got his daily dose of bug juice. Hey. Isn't this a joke? I bet nobody's watching. - What's this, huh? - Hey, come on. Hey. - What are you doing here? - Come on... It's a sculpture. I'd like to see it. Just put it down. Hmm. - Hey! - Ah, but immediately you get my point. Getting a little upset? We're locked in a cement box. Might as well be on the moon, and you're playing with a piece of clay. How upset should I get? Whatever. You're the one playing with it. You'd better do something. When they come back and see that you haven't done anything, maybe next time you'll be in reading class. What do I draw? Just whatever you feel. - Like what? - I don't know. Draw that chair, there. How about fuck-face over here? - Ben? - No. Leave him. I like him like this. At his best. Tom, how's it going? Great. - I wanted to ask you something. - What? I couldn't get into the armory. It's where they keep all the weapons. I know what the armory is, Nathan. Well, I'm supposed to have a key for the armory. And they keep telling me they're gonna get me one, but they don't. - What do you need to get in there for? - Well... I need to talk to Lofton for a second. - Excuse me. - Okay, I'll just... Dr. Lofton, can I get a minute, please? - Sure. What is it, Tom? - Look, I've been away for over a week and none of the most simple modifications have been taken care of in that whole time. It's funding, Tom. Some of these drugs we've been working with here... They're experimental, you know. Very exciting stuff. Psychiatric history kind of stuff. I don't know if you knew that, but these pharmaceuticals I'm speaking of... they don't get made in bulk, so it's extremely expensive. Yeah, I wish you the best with all that. I do. But right now we're in trouble. This whole place is in trouble. Tom, stop, okay? Transitioning back from vacation can be difficult. You were away fishing or playing cards with the family or whatever. And then you come back to our world here at Northwood, and it's difficult. Okay, right now we're calling 3F, but nobody's over there. And no one's watching any of the monitors. Tom, relax. Breathe. Order is natural. Order is beautiful. There will be order. They don't give you a fucking eraser. You wanna do it for me? - What? - Yours is good enough. Do something for me. What about my style? They're gonna know it's my style. I just asked you to draw something for me. Please? - Let me see. I'll get you started. - Yo, hold on. That's no good. Here. Well, draw something. Draw him. I don't think so. Fuck him, then. Do whatever you want. Just make it look like I was serious, though. So, murder, huh? What about it? I'm drawing you a building, all right? I used to do servicemen. Take 'em out for whores on this little rented boat. Only there weren't any whores. Just me. What's that? It's a ladder. Come on, Allen. We're not gonna get in trouble. Jake and I come up here all the time. Careful, Allen. Careful. Watch it. Don't fall. Stop it! And you get that knife. And you know it's sharp enough to go all the way up. Where the skin on the neck just separates. - What are those? - Those are birds. Ah. Hey. Don't make it too fucking wonderful. You know what? This shit's over. - What's over? - You talking to me. I don't want you to do it anymore. You don't tell me what not to do. - Just stay away from me. - I'm sorry? I'm serious. You stay away from me. You keep all that sick shit to yourself. Am I disturbing you? Hmm? Is this offensive? Are you disturbed? Am I upsetting you? Hmm? 'Cause I didn't even tell you about the little children. - Hey, shut your mouth! - Whoa-ho! Shut your mouth. I'm warning you. You're warning me? - Don't. - What? I said don't. And I said don't tell me what not to do. You touch me... Touch me. Touch me. Touch me! Touch me. Touch me. Touch me. Touch me. Ben! - Ben! Ah! - Touch me. Touch me. Touch me. I haven't killed somebody in a long time. - Leave him alone! - I'm due. Oh, fuck! Hey! What's going on in here? Well, we're all really impressed with your big entrance. Okay, okay. Let's all calm down. Everything's cool. What were we talking about? You take him down to Baker. Yeah, take me down to Baker. All right. On three. One, two... Go ahead. I got this. No, no, what about this guy? We're cool. Was he dangerous? No. He was loud. He was really loud at one point. What did that other one do? Nothing. He didn't do anything? No. Yeah, okay. I'll just take a look at the video. Hit that switch for me over there, please? Look. I might not be here much longer, so I gotta talk to you. Like I might not normally talk to you. Just play the game. Tell them what they want to hear. Right now, try to make things better for yourself. Little by little. Go to chapel. And that guy in there with you? It's fine you don't snitch because you gotta live here. And that's right. But don't get in with people like that. - 'Cause he's not your friend. - Friend, friend, friend. - Friend, friend, friend... - It's okay. Easy, man. - Friend... - Easy. Breathe. Breathe. It's okay. Friend. Friend. Is he talking to you? Is he? Yeah. I guess so. I wanna be respectful and I appreciate the opportunity to be here today. Because you believe... Maybe I could. What? What you were saying. You'd like to go with us on our next visit? Maybe, yeah. "Maybe yes"? Yes... ahem... yes. Good. Good. Mia? Don't forget your baking. Yes. How are things? Well, my medication has been changed. And, uh, lately I've been feeling especially lonely. Sometimes I'm scared, because I think I'll disappear. Sometimes I wish I would. This is the minimum security rec room. Here's the kitchen. You're welcome to use it. Bring your own... Bring your own food, you clean up after yourself. Welcome to use any of the games. Anything you take out, you gotta put back. This here is Phil. This is Lem. - Maybe these guys can show you around. - Hey. - Hi. - Nice to meet ya. I want to be happy. I think that's what I want. There's this... other thing in me, though, that doesn't seem to care about that. I... I think... I just... I have to think... all this was handed down to me. Like it's... It's been always coming down to me... from somewhere. Like from somewhere before there were horses. Before... I don't know. Like by a great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great... What was I saying? You want to stay? Hold me down. Hold me down. - Thank you, Allen. - You're welcome. This is very, very thoughtful. Happy birthday, Mom. What did you get me? You come right here, right now. Did you make me something? I talk... and talk, you know. But I'm... still lonely. Ben? Ben? This way, Mia. Thank you, Eloy. Put it right down here. Right down here, Mia. Lisa? Sheri, put that in the kitchen. Like, Phil might feel different than Zoe and... Lisa may feel different than Josh and... getting along is about seeing the other person's point of view and respecting that. To get out of here and to make a go of it, you need to do that. Hey. Those cookies with the powdered sugar, they were a big hit. - Did you make those? - No. I put them on the pan and then I took them off the pan. I didn't have any, actually. I was just going by reactions, how fast they went. Snooze, you lose. This is an unusual kind of co-mixing, isn't it? They told us there hasn't been any acts of violence with you guys in seven years. Well, I feel reassured. Yeah, me, too. Do you want something to drink? Yeah. - Okay. - I'll go with you. This one. Do you care why I'm here? No. What, I'm gonna say something about you? Like I don't have a story. What's your story? I'm bipolar and I'm gonna be on medication for the rest of my life. I started a fire. This T-shirt store where I'd been working. But there were old people living upstairs, so... Anyway... - A woman with a past. - Yeah, that's right. You're probably Jack the Ripper or something, right? - I'm what? I'm... - Very pretty. I should help them clean up over there. Hey. You wanna live in Denver? Mm-hmm. Yeah, they said I could start at the courthouse the first day of next month. Better pay. Advancement possibilities. Yeah, yeah. And less chance of that. So, anyway, look, I gotta go. I just wanted to let you know. Okay. - You have one. - I know how to play. ...ask you what you heard and what you understood. You're gonna try to feel what... You're killing me. - I have... - Because... well. Hold on. You're gonna try to feel what Josh was feeling... Yeah, see, I have two queens. You have three nines. Dr. Lofton? Dr. Lofton. I'd like to ask you something. Oh, I'm actually running late to the Wilton. Not that I'm looking forward to it. I'm sitting with a neurologist this year. What is it, Beth? I was wondering if, under controlled circumstances, chaperoned circumstances, we might allow for the males and the females to have one-on-one visitation? Beth, please. Do I have to tell you there are some who don't want things here made too nice for our people? I doubt if they saw the pain and emptiness in these people's lives, there would be many who would wish anything worse on them. You've been here a long time, haven't you? Yes. A long time. Try it once. Just once. I want a full report and all the documentations. Beth, anything goes wrong, it is your responsibility. I understand, Dr. Lofton. What did you do to yourself? Oh. It was Terri. She was getting an injection and she threw her head back. It was totally my fault. For goodness' sake. Wait a minute. Here. This is light on me, but it's going to be dark on you. Yeah. You couldn't receive visitors before. I was in maximum security before. Did you do something else? No. That's where everyone goes when they first get here. Then they observed me and sent me over here. They got better conditions, I guess. Yes. Somebody told me holding on to your anger's. Like holding onto a hot coal and waiting to throw it at somebody. I know you're not faking it, being in here. But you've had something wrong with you for a long time. - That's no excuse. - I know it's not! You murdered my beautiful boy, you son of a bitch. And I don't care how crazy you are or what you thought he did. I would very much like to do to you what you did to him. But I can't do that. I have to stay as far away from your kind of ugliness as I can get. I have to forgive you. That's not why you're here. You're here because I was with him at the end. You wanna know about it. Yes. I don't think he was in much actual pain. Not sharp pain, anyway. He could feel something bad happening, of course. The first strike was to the forearm, which he raised using a large wrench. I knew that I broke it right away. He was questioning me, you know. Questioning the whole time. He said... He said, "Don't" at one point. - Don't. - He was looking right at me. And I was gonna go to hit him again, in the leg this time. With a hammer. The sharp end. The end that you pull nails out with. As I remember it now, the way... the way he said, "Don't... " It was like I was gonna hurt both of us. I ended it after that. It was a final hit to the top of the head. Here. I think I did it quick... because I didn't... I didn't wanna let it in. I wanted to finish what I wanted to do. Do you attend the church that they have here? No. Well, I... I'm gonna go. I'm gonna keep looking in on your situation, but, uh... You're gonna get what you deserve. You won't understand it, but you're gonna get it. Mom? Mom? - Hey. - Hey. She said we can have some time together as long as she's there, of course. Really? Yeah. On my birthday. Apparently you got good references. That's amazing. Do you want to? Sure. Yeah. She's into it. She is. Is there a word for someone like that? What, into that kinda thing? Yeah. Um... yeah, I don't know. - Uh, romantic? - Yeah. Hey, Tom. Going home? Yeah. I'm outta here, man. Come on. Eat up. Eat it! Come on. Eat it already! Let's go! Eat it! Eat it! Hello, Allen. Hi. Eloy? You can come back in an hour. Hey. Happy birthday. You want a drink? - No, what is that? - Gin. You guys get liquor and stuff over here. Maybe so. I've never seen it. - You want? - Nah. I'm good. Hope you don't mind me. No. Not at all. Hey. Hey, come on. Let's go. Yo. Let's move it. Whatever your deal is, you take it over there, okay? Hey. Monkey. I said... You feel that? Yeah. That's sharp, ain't it? - Take it easy. - Don't you touch that radio, now. Everything's gonna be okay. - Get on your knees. - We can work through this. ...Inalienable right to brush his teeth. The implements of this hygienic process have been first codified by the code of... What's up? You know the way out of here? Oh, yeah. Well, don't just stay here. Go on, escape. Run! Go on! Something's wrong now? No. Things are very right. You're so serious. Yeah. That. The fact is, I don't know. I feel good. It's strange. You know, it's like the better I feel, - the stranger it is. - Shut up. Here, take a hit of this. All right. Wow. - Yeah. - Strong. - Move. - Hey. - Which way is the best way out? - This way. All right, go up there and come back here as soon as possible. Don't get caught. Please. I'm gonna go up here, see if this door is open. This is my thing. - Scissors? - What? Scissors? - What's that way? - No, we gotta go this way. - Well, can we get out here? - Yeah, we go that way. So what are you gonna do when you get out? What do you mean? What, no plans? Yeah. Be alone, then die. Don't say that. What do you think? I'm gonna settle down in some nice, cozy... Sure. You can put cookies on a pan and take them off. Funny. No, but you could... you know, you could find somebody or... What would a normal guy do with me? He himself would have to be seriously messed up. Yeah, like me. No. It doesn't matter. I'm... - I'm gonna tell you what I did, okay? - No. I killed a guy for raping my girlfriend. - Oh. - That's what I did. That's great. That's... - That's marvelous. - No, it's not. - It's not great. Okay? - Okay. Whatever you say. I'm gonna go. - I don't... - Hey, please. Don't go. I don't want you to go. Please. Isn't this like... I don't know. God, you look so great right now. No. Just sit down, at least. She's gonna come in any minute now. Hey. What? You look good, too. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hello? Yes. Oh, my goodness. No. Do that. It's gonna be a total lock-down now so I'll get them and I'll bring them back. That's right. And then I'll get her and I'll bring her back. All right. Yes. Goodbye. Hello. - She's gonna come in here any minute. - Yeah. - She should have a while ago. - Yeah, I know. Just... just a sec. This whole woman's life, I've never known her to be even a second late. Yeah. Should I... should I go get her or... No. Hey. There's no hope. I don't want hope. I don't want it. Ho ho ho, man. Oh, man. Tarses, what the hell are you doing here? Oh. Well, now. This is just too fucking much. What, are you escaping? What do you think? I'm on a pass? Now, you don't... you don't come in here. Well, hey, look. Scissors. You... you put that down. You ever seen a fight where one guy has a knife? Allen. Oh, my... my golly. Oh, my gosh. Hey, Allen. Ben... Ben. What are you doing here? I escaped with Carl. And we escaped together. Oh. - Did you take care of that lady? - What lady? Mrs. Standings? - Standings? - Wha... what? Ben, what did you do? Ben? What did you do? Careful, Allen. Careful, Allen. This one life is a trip, ain't it? - Here. - I don't want that. You should. To back me up. Have you heard anything new? Only that they caught those two, like you know. But not the other one you asked about. - Torres, was it? - Tarses. Whew. - Where you going right now? - I'm leaving. - You can't. - The red code is on. The captain himself called and said all the civilians can go. - Warren's dead. - Yes, it's terrible. We're going to have a serious look at how this whole situation transpired. There will be a great deal... Nathan. - I'll be available by phone. - That's good. Is there anything - you would like to say to me? - No. I am going to go, then. Yeah. - You go. - Hey, mister... I gotta get to work. Come on, Nathan. Nathan. Nathan! - What are we doing? - You tell me. They're gonna come through that door any minute now. Allen, no, no. Don't be upset. Allen, no. No. Don't... don't be upset, Allen. - Come on. - What about you? You haven't said much. Feel free. - No. - No? You have pressing business? I'd rather not be here. Really? - Hold on, okay? - Where would you like to be? I don't wanna play. Aw, that's too bad. 'Cause we're gonna play anyway. - Hey. - Don't. - I will stab you so fast... - Hey! - Shut up! - Please! What is it, my dear? You don't have to do anything bad. I don't know if that's actually true. Careful, Allen. Watch it. Don't fall. - Stop it! - What a baby. Mom? Mom, I.. I didn't mean to! I didn't mean to! I didn't mean to! Allen. Allen. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. No. Leave things. Leave things. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Careful. Would you shut your mouth? Or you're gonna go in there with him. - Okay. Okay. - Let's go. Come on. Get over there. Let's go. - Okay, okay. - Take it off. - Wait a minute. - No, take it off. - Please? - I said no. Now take this off. I have gin. You want some? - You have gin? - Yeah, right over there. In the baby oil bottle. Right there. Have some. Don't move. You have gin. Oh... - Come on. - Wait a minute. Wait. - Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. - Come on. - Can I just... - Shh. Where, where? Right here? It's gonna be right here. On the floor. Come on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do this. - Don't... don't do this. - Don't talk to me. Please. Please. Don't you make me deal with you. I don't even want you bad. Now let's go. - No. - What do you mean "no"? No. - Then I'll kill you. - Then you have to. You fucking whore. I do what I want. Ah! What the... Now you did it. Now you did it. Now we're getting somewhere! Get off her. Get off... Hey, I'm due! I'm due. Stab. Stab. I stabbed him, Allen. I stabbed him. Stabbed him. I don't know... I just... I just... - Jab, jab, jab... - Gimme those. - No! - Give them to me! Okay, fine. But watch out... those are sharp. Look at him. I bet he's mad. Come on. You've got the scissors. - You got the scissors. - Get back! Okay! This is your thing. I don't care. I hate the whole cock-sucking world and everything in it. Including myself. I'm the devil. You can't kill me. No, you're not! No, you're not! No, no, no! No! No! You are not the devil and I am not the devil. The devil is a flea. You ever seen a dog? They have those... you know, those little pink little baby puppies, and all these black needles just jump all over them right away. Ya seen that, huh? That's what I would call the devil. I'm sorry. I'm going to calm down. I'm gonna calm down, okay? I really am. Allen, Allen, Allen, Allen. I have to tell you something, okay? I have to tell you. I'm going to tell him now. Allen, okay, um, that lady. You know, Mrs. Standings? Okay, I went with her into this room and I did something with her. No, no, no, Allen, don't... no, don't be mad at me. 'Cause I did not touch her until after he had already strangled her to death, okay? So you see... so there wouldn't... there wouldn't be any bad feelings. She wouldn't think badly... She wouldn't think badly of me. Please... Allen, please. That's it. - It ends. - Fucking A. It's over. I could have killed Argh-hh! Do it with your hands. All right. You up to it? You want my opinion? Shut up. Someone's coming. Oh, yeah. - It's just me and you now. - Yeah. Come on. We can talk, but I don't really know what to say. I'm a criminal. Do it! Come on! Come on. Come on... Don't. No. No! I'm gonna go get help. No, no. No! No! No! No. I appreciate you transferring me to this less restricted area. Not because of mercy or charity. But because you believe in the philosophy of rehabilitation. I guess I'd rather show you by my actions than by anything that I say. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. I'm all right. I'm all right. You didn't mean to. No. Go get help. Hang in there. Come on. Oh, no. I'm sorry. It's okay. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Let's skip the talk. All this... all this talk, our voices, it just seems to separate us. The quiet we share. You are now a resident of Northwood State Secure Treatment Facility... a secure, multilevel treatment facility since 1962. You're here either because you have been found incompetent to stand trial, not guilty by reason of insanity, or you're undergoing a forensic evaluation, as in the case of some of our visitors up from the state jails and penitentiary. It does not matter. Whatever your reason for being here or the length of your stay, all residents of Northwood... "Till there's simply no room. " "Don't forget what you said. " "Seems the least you could do. " "Yes, it's time to move on. " "Before we do much more harm. " "To ourselves. " "So come on, take a look at me. " "Come on, take a look at me. " "Come on, take a look at me now. " "You've taken every bit of me. " "You've taken every bit of me. " "You've taken every bit of me now. " "I'm so tired. " "But I just can't put out this fire. " "At the edge of a cliff. " "Contemplating the fall. " "With no footing left. " "Tied to nothing at all. " "But I still see your face. " "The one thing that my mind won't erase. " "So come on, take a look at me. " "Come on, take a look at me. " "Come on, take a look at me now. " "You've taken every bit of me. " "You've taken every bit of me. " "You've taken every bit of me now. " "I'm so tired. " "But I just can't put out this fire. " "And from the moment it lands. " "It's nothing that I understand. " "But for a second I see. " "What could be. " "So come on, take a look at me. " "Come on, take a look at me. " "Come on, take a look at me now. " "You've taken every bit of me. " "You've taken every bit of me. " "You've taken every bit of me now. " "So come on, take a look at me. " "Come on, take a look at me. " "Come on, take a look at me now. " "You've taken every bit of me. " "You've taken every bit of me. " "You've taken every bit of me now. " "I'm so tired. " "But I just can't put out this fire. " "I just can't put out this fire. " "I just can't put out this fire. " "I just can't put out this fire. " "I just can't put out this fire. "
