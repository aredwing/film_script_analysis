Really nice. Evan, get help. Get help! l don't need help! What l need is my blanket! - Man, you're crazy! - l am not crazy! l want my goo-gaa! l want my goo-gaa! He wasn't always this way. Once upon a time, he was a king. The king of Somewhere. Strong and powerful. What l'm suggesting is that you reallocate 8% of your equity into international markets. He protected his loyal subjects and made them feel safe. All right, are you looking at the charts? Well, these are actually very conservative projections. Yes they are. But one day he left his Kingdom and he got lost in the Land of Nowhere. Something no one could have ever imagined. Imagine That Everybody's upped their stocks... I am here to taIk about finances, Wall Street... In Nowhere Land, everybody wanted to be king, or at Ieast they aII try to be. Evan, it's Noah. I got a feather. - You got a what? - A feather. lt was on my desk with a note attached. - From Johnny Whitefeather? - Yup. What'd the note say? "l'll be at your 9:00 a.m. See you in there. Ain't nothing but a thing." - Wow. Then the rumor must be true. - What? What rumor? - Stevens is cashing in. - What? - He's selling the company? - He has to be. His repIacement is gonna be me or Johnny! You're gonna get this job! - Hey. Good morning! - Good morning, Mr. Danielson. - Good morning! - Good morning, Mr. Danielson. It was a very strange pIace. ...and they've narrowed it down to our firm and two others. And it is confirmed, Whitefeather is gonna be in the meeting. The King was reaIIy unhappy there. He just couIdn't figure out why. - Hey, Tod! - What's up, Mr. D? Take this down to graphics and add it to my chart, all right? - After l... - Now. - What about the... - Hey, "now" now, man. What's up? - How much are we paying that guy? - He's an unpaid intern. lt might be too much. l think it was because he was aIways working to protect his castIe from those who wanted to steal his crown. Johnny Whitefeather. Evan Danielson. Fellow salmon swimming upstream. - After you, sir. - Thank you. So those of us he left behind went out into the land to rescue him. Whip, l said l'd sit you down with our two best financial managers. Evan's been our number-one guy for the last eight and a half years. Johnny's been with us for 16 months, but he's already one of our top producers. Either way, you'll be well taken care of here at Smith/Stevens. - Evan? - Mr. Bryson. You've made some really sound investments, but quite frankly, l think we can do better. Let's see if you agree. Evan Danielson's office. Now, this will give you a solid base of capital and a 9 to 11 % yield, annually. Yeah, l understand. ls it... His daughter? Did you call her mother? Because if l say it's urgent and he's really, really... The goo-gaa? - Fantastic, Evan. - Thank you, Tom. - Johnny? - Thank you, Tom. Whip. Dave, Lee, Troy. l see those looks of skepticism, just like old man Stevens the first week that he hired me. Said to himself, "l hired an lndian. Can he handle money?" And how. Hey, l really appreciate you letting me contribute a little piece of venison to your potlatch. Okay. We're here under one sky. All of us, under one sky. Let's appreciate that. One sky. Evan Danielson, that man over there is a seer. Uses the whole eye. But there is a difference between sight and vision. Sight is about what lies just in front of us. Vision is about what lies ahead. - The genius of the hawk... - Excuse me. Johnny, sorry to interrupt you in one of your always interesting stories about nature, but, gentlemen, l have... l'm gonna have to leave you, Mr. Bryson, in the very capable hands of my colleague Mr. Noah Kulick here. l have a little family emergency at my daughter's school l have to take care of. Thank you for your time, sir. That's what we're all talking about. Life, nest, eggs. Circle of life. Yeah. Hakuna matata. l'm so sorry, but the school kept calling. - Don't tell me. The goo-gaa. - Yeah. l hate that blanket! We don't normally allow any kind of security items at school, but because of yours and Trish's separation, we made a temporary exception. Unfortunately, it's just not workable anymore. Hey, you guys. So this is why l was called out of work? Because my daughter's sitting by herself at recess? No, the reason l called you, Mr. Danielson, is because her class went inside She's still sitting here because Kupida and Mopida told her to. - Kupida and Mopida are... - Yeah. l know. Her imaginary friends. l told Trish we're gonna have to do something about that blanket. Well, Trish and l discussed this, and we both feel that what needs to be dealt with is the reason why she still feels she needs a blanket. lt's usually an indication of some kind of emotional needs that haven't been met. What's happening? Are they talking? Well, you know, sometimes, these things are like a Band-Aid. You just have to rip it off. Right. Rip it. Rip. Kupida. l can't hear you both at the same time. Go ahead, Mopida. Wait. Wait a minute. Someone's coming. Hey, Liv. - Hi, Daddy. - Hey, baby. Hey, remember we talked about how the day was gonna come when you couldn't take the goo-gaa to school with you anymore? That day is gonna be today. So what Daddy's gonna do is l'm gonna take the goo-gaa. l'm gonna hold on to it for you. When you get home from school, you'll get it back then, all right? All right, sweetie. Just give me the goo-gaa. And you have a great day. All right, baby. As you know, the Mile High City Arts Council relies solely on contributions. Yeah. l've got 12 people and four desks. We need your money. Mr. Cosgrove, can l call you right back? Trish, please, this is a really bad week. Evan, l told you three months ago that this week was pledge week. - That's this week? - Yes. You promised me you wouldn't do this. You promised me. Look, Evan, l know you and her haven't ever... - Trish, please, not this week. - ...had a chance... - Not this week. l'm begging you. - ...to connect. - Can we flip-flop and l'll do it next week? - No! - l promise you... - No. Evan, even if l could, l wouldn't. Evan, why did you tell me you even wanted to have children? 'Cause l did. l do! l just didn't know l'd be so bad at it. You know, Evan, you're a really smart guy. You make huge deals every day. l'm sure you'll find a way to deal with her. Sweetie, you're gonna go with Daddy, okay? - Okay. - He's so excited. And l'm gonna call you every night to say good night. - Promise? - You'll be fine. You'll be fine. - Okay. - l love you, kiddo. l love you, too. Okay, here we go. Hey, you're a competitive guy. That's intimidating, especially in a father figure. Okay, first of all, l'm not her father figure. l'm her father. And she's the one that's intimidating. - What? - Honestly. She just stares at me! Or through me. She's got this imaginary world that she goes to with Kupida and Kapuda and Zupida. l don't get it. Look, l'm gonna put this as gently as possible, okay? You're a complete idiot. You feel out of control and you project that onto her. Hey, look, man. Be my friend and be my client. But don't be Mr. Mystic Man or whatever that is you call yourself. - Man Whisperer. - The Man Whisperer. John Strother, former cornerback for the Denver Broncos, is now known as the "Man Whisperer." - That's right. - You be whispering to men. Look, all l'm saying is that we all have a little kid inside, right here. - Yeah. Yeah. - And he's whispering. Stop. Please. Stop. Stop! lf you don't whisper to little Evan, - you'll never get through to Olivia! - l'm not whispering to little Evan - and l'm not whispering with you. - You just did. No, l wasn't. No, l wasn't whispering with you. l was whispering on the other... You was finished talking, and then l said "whisper" after. l wasn't whispering with you. Little Evan? What's wrong with little Evan? Say it again. Say, "Whisper to little Evan," one more time. Say it again. - You know what's gonna happen? - What's gonna happen? What? - What you gonna do? - l'm gonna crash your portfolio. What's that have to do with anything? - Hey, baby. - Hey. - You wear him out? - No, but Olivia will. - Where are they at? - Upstairs. Princess dress-up. What? They started without me? - Hey, Ev. Livvy's upstairs. - Thanks. Thanks for watching her. Absolutely. Anytime. And Trish told me to remind you, vaccinations on Thursday. - Okay. - And Ella's party is Friday. lt's a sleepover here, so pack all of her stuff. And the Fall Sing is Saturday. Livvy's really nervous, so go through her songs with her. She doesn't think l'm gonna remember all this, does she? No. She does not. Oh, no. Come on, guys. More! l want to be beautiful! Hey, Ev. l've got the perfect size seat for little Evan. - Come, sit down. - l think l'm fine. l'm okay. Come on, Liv, let's go. We gotta go. - Bye, Olivia. - Bye, Ella. - Bye, Liv. - Bye. Denver Broncos, huh? No, Mopida, l can't go. No. Well, yeah. Are you sure, Mopida? Okay, if you say so. What? He actually had a snake? A real snake? Nobody's going to fall for this whole shtick. What we have to do is find a better way to do this, all right? No, no, listen. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna eliminate TriTek. No, no, no, no. Look, l'm looking at the specs here, and l don't like what l see. First of... Hold on a second. Olivia, what are you doing? Go back to bed. - You said you'd be a king. - l said l'd do what? You said last time that next time you'd do dress up, and you'd be a king. Well, l don't recall saying that. l don't remember saying that. And even if l did say that, l don't have the right stuff to do king stuff here. l don't have any king clothes, and l don't have a king hat. lt's called a crown. - Evan, you there? - Hold on a second. Whatever. Olivia, please, just go to bed. l will sleep in here. No, you're sleeping in your room. That's why you have a bedroom. - You go sleep in your bedroom. - l do not want to sleep in there. All right. You're gonna go to sleep? You promise? Go over there and lay down. Be quiet, Olivia. l have to work here, all right? l'm sorry, man. Where was l? What was l saying? Listen, this is where we're gonna snake Whitefeather. 'Cause he's thinking we're gonna go for the obvious play, Solocom. But what we're gonna do... Digital Fiber. Digital Fiber is the play. - That's the obvious choice. - Stop saying... Hold on a second. - Olivia. - What? Yeah, sorry about that, man. Look. No, no, no. You gotta be quiet. lt's his job, not yours. Can l call you back? Thank you. All right, that's it. Now, l asked you to be quiet, but you don't listen. - Yes, l do. - No, you don't. l asked you not to talk, but you kept talking. You don't know how to listen, so since you don't know how to listen, you take your blanket and you go in your room. Go. Come on now. Come on, come on, really, please. Come on, please. l'm saying, "Please." Go to bed, please. Now what? What is it? Look, l told you, l will play king with you some other time. Daddy has a lot of work to do. All right? So... What? l do listen. l'm sorry. How many days till l go back home? I've gone over everything we taIked about Iast night, and it aII Iooks great. That's perfect, because Whitefeather's gonna go with Solocom. - Of course. - But we got a better alternative. - Digital Fiber. - Got a good record. Exactly. l'm gonna call you in 20 minutes, - right after l drop Olivia off to school. - Very nice. All right. Okay. Come on, honey. Let's get going. Daddy's sort of in a hurry. l think this milk is spoiled. No. That's not possible, because l checked this milk. Come on, let's go! Let's go. What if we say we just get a muffin, huh? Tomorrow, can we make pancakes? Honey, l don't know if l have the right stuff for that, - you know, supply-wise or skill-wise. - l can help you. l got a better idea. How about we leave a note for Graciella, she can make some pancakes, put them in the freezer, we'll thaw them out and eat them tomorrow, huh? Yeah. - Not what l was thinking. - Move! Let's move! Hey, you didn't pack my Fall Sing music. Okay, your Fall Sing... Where is that stuff? Okay, here it is! Right here. Right here's your music. Rick? - l thought you said you were in a hurry. - Yeah. l'm coming right now. Okay, stop, stop, stop. Once is enough. Hey, does Mommy ever make a new friend, you know, in like a... - You mean Rick? - Yes, Rick. ls that the guy from Mommy's work with the spiked hair and the pointed face? "Hello, l'd like to talk to you for a sec." That guy? No, that's Skip. Rick is tall. Handsome, too. He looks like Prince Charming. Good for Rick. - Morning, Graciella. - Morning, Mr. Danielson. - Hi, Graciella. - Hi, Olivia. Nice to see you. Hey, Graciella! One thing. Can you please make some pancakes and put them in the freezer for us? Thank you so much. All right. Hey, what are you, a button maniac? Stop it. Press one floor and leave it alone. Daddy? Kupida wanted me to tell you something. Yeah. Go ahead. She heard what you were saying on the phone last night, and she told me to tell you she doesn't like either of them. Which guy? Rick or Skip? The companies, Solocom and Digital Fiber. Kupida doesn't like them, neither does Mopida, and Qwali agrees. Daddy, do you know why they don't like them? Daddy, l said, do you know why they don't like them? - Why? - Because they're broken. - Do you know which one they do like? - No, honey, l have no idea. The first one, the one you threw away, TriTek. - Are you sure you're listening? - Yes, Daddy sure is listening, but come on, we got to go. Let's go. Kupida and Mopida really like it. - You know why? - Why is that? - Because it has buried treasure. - Yeah? Okay. - You aren't listening. - No, no, Daddy's listening. Okay, so, we're here, and we're going in. And there's something you have to go without. Hey, come on, come on, Olivia, let's go, let's go. - Liv! How are you? - Hi! - Give me five. - Put her there. Put her there. Okay, guys, l got, like, three meetings back to back. She's just gonna sit down here and get settled down here. Let's get settled in. All right. - Mike, which one can l get rid of? - Well... That one. No. You don't say that one. That's sacrilege. That's Dante D'Enzo. We never get rid of Dante D'Enzo. - Kupida says he's boring. - Well, Kupida is estpida. Because he happens to be one of the greatest investors on the planet. - No, he's boring. - No, no. Why am l standing here arguing with you about Kupida? Let me get something for you to watch. There you go. There's the... What's that? Barney. Okay, look, can you watch my kid for me? You have my back for me, Mike? Watch that Barney and l'll be... That's not Barney. That's Blue. And now I'm going to tap your knee very gentIy... Did you see that? ...by increasing your family's holdings in optical fiber. lf you take a look at these charts here on page six in your folders... Granted, Solocom looks solid, but if you pore over the financials, it's crystal clear, the smart play here is Digital Fiber. - Kupida says no. - Okay. - No. - Let's move on Digital Fiber. l'm sorry. Don't move on Digital Fiber? Oh, no. Yes, yes. Do go, yes. No. - No? - Yes. Yes, go, yes. - Mother? - Tom? Johnny? Perhaps you have something to add? Not really. lt's good work from Evan. Digital Fiber. Solocom. l struggled with it myself last night. l went to sleep convinced l was gonna take the Pressman family towards that pretty face, Solocom. But in the middle of the night, the dream sparrow comes to me. She taps me on the forehead and says, "Wake up, handsome brave. "There's something happening in Uzbekistan." "Uzbeka-what? "lt's 4:30 in the morning, little friend. l'm sleeping." But she said there's a kalacampi, the worm hidden in the apple. And l let the dream sparrow fly away. - The dream sparrow. - But l investigated what she said on the white fire grid you people call the lnternet. At 4:15 this morning, Mountain Standard Time, the Uzbeki government followed through on a series of threats to detonate a nuclear weapon. Boom. Digital Fiber, Solocom, all of their underground cabling that they were relying upon, lost in that mushroom cloud. Do l blame Uzbekistan? No. Defend yourself, mountain republic, just like you said you would. You followed through. But 200 miles south, in Turkmenistan, a little company called TriTek, didn't look like much to me yesterday, but today, their 6,000 miles of already-buried underground cabling, looking a lot more valuable. TriTek, baby. l say we go into TriTek. - Let's keep our fingers crossed, huh? - Okay. Evan, you mind if l sit in on your 11:00? Well, Johnny, that's not up to me. That's up to the client. So it's cool? Because l checked with the client, and they said it's okay. That's great. That's great. Hey, ain't nothing but a thing. The herd moves on, but you're going to be fine, little elk. You're going to be just fine. One sky, man. One sky. l didn't realize you guys were so tight. You know what l want you to do for me, Tod? Go down to legal and check something out for me. Okay? l want to know what the ramifications are if l were to stab Johnny Whitefeather. - Daddy! - Not now, sweetie. - But, Daddy! - Hey, not now. And listen to me, Liv. This is where Daddy works. You cannot come down here and stand outside my meetings and flail your arms around. - Rose! - Yeah. Can you take Olivia downstairs and get her a muffin or something? - Are you hungry, honey? - No. l don't think she's hungry. She's starving. l can see that. Come on. Here we go. Let's go get a muffin. Have some girl talk. - Hey, Ev. - Hey, give me a second, Noah. l'm trying to find my notes for the 11:00. Actually, it pertains to the 11:00. Quickly, two things. First, Johnny has just asked me to join his tribe. l can't believe it. He actually calls his team a tribe. Yeah, it's stupid. - And you said yes, didn't you? - No, no, absolutely not, at first. But then he put so much pressure on me. He needed an answer immediately. So... lt's all well and good, Noah. But thanks for your loyalty, all right. Now if you don't mind, l gotta get ready in about 10 minutes, so if you'd be so... That's the other thing. About the 11:00, Johnny moved it up. He had a conflict at 11:00. Johnny moved my meeting with my clients? Yeah. lt started at 10:30, so l popped in here as a courtesy to you, because we were so tight for so long. And thank you so much for hiring me. - Out! - Okay, l gotta go. Rose! Where are my notes for the 11:00? - Sorry. l think they're in there. - They're not in there. Mr. D, l talked to the lawyer guy upstairs and he confirmed my hunch about the whole stabbing Mr. Whitefeather thing. lt's a definite no-can-do from a legal standpoint. - Go away, Tod. Go very far away. - Yes. Right. l can't find them. Well, they're here somewhere, Rose. Please, l can't make it happen without my notes. - Find my notes. Please. - Okay. Okay. Okay. All of a sudden, l'm late for a meeting that l was early for in the first place. All right. lt's all right. We're gonna find them. Oh, my God. Did you draw on my worksheets? - Qwali said l could. - Qwali said you could? Qwali said you could. But let me tell you something, Olivia. l'm getting ready to go into a meeting with grown people. They're gonna be judging Daddy, and all of a sudden, my worksheets have pictures of flowers and sparkly stuff and, what is this, people kissing or something? Kupida says they might get married. And why is this sticky? Why is this so sticky? lt's sparkle glue. Sparkly. This is a disaster. - A horror show. - Live. Love. Laugh. Walahala! Live. Love. Laugh. Walahala! l have never, guys, l have never felt so jazzed about the prospects of our pension fund! l mean it. l am jazzed! l wish l could take credit, Fred, but we gotta give that to the Walahala, Mr. Waterfall. Hey, rain down prosperity! - And how. - Thank you, Johnny! Evan. Everybody, you remember Evan Danielson. l would hope so, after seven years of working with you guys. Yeah. Of course. How's it going there, Evan? Good to see you. Hey, look, while we were waiting for you, Mr. Whitefeather, he made some rather radical suggestions, as you can see. - Yeah. - Yeah. So what do you think, Evan? You agree with Mr. Whitefeather here, or do you have some special insight that you'd like to share with us about how you would increase the fund? l think l do have some insight. l don't agree with Mr. Whitefeather. What l was going to suggest was a 4% reallocation away from convertible arbitrage. And in addition to that... Okay. Good. Thank you. l don't know about you guys, but this is good for me. Didn't l tell you he was good? Hey, man. Sometimes the best spear is the one you don't throw. Ain't nothing but a thing. "Ain't nothing but a thing." What does that even mean, Johnny? lt's not a thing, but it is? lt's something, but it's not a thing? But it's not. But it's something. What is... l'm confused! What's that? You're a seeker, brother crow. You should ride that... You know what? Stop it right now. Stop it! Because l'm not going to be subjected to your Dr. Seuss-meets-Pocahontas stuff today. "One sky, two sky, red sky, blue sky!" Evan, that's shadow time. Okay. Let's keep that in the shadows. Oh, no. Please, please, please, make him stop. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Lord, Lord, Lord, make him stop, Lord. Why are you falling for this? What's the matter? l've been working for you for seven years. And you know that, Fred! l went to your grandson's birthday party, and l went to Aspen with you and your wife for the whole weekend. We got history together. You gonna throw it all away because this guy showed you some waterfalls and got you chanting "Walla Walla"? Evan, we're always looking for fresh ideas, and he showed us some. lt's like Johnny says. You got turtles that live in their shell and turtles that live out of their shell. What? What? What did you just say? What did he say? Johnny just said... What did he tell you? What was that? What did he say? What? He said turtles with no shell... Called geckos, man. That's not even biology! How could you listen... What's a frog, Johnny? A short snake? You want new ideas? Special new ideas. Okay. 'Cause slow, predictable growth is so boring. Let's talk about... Let's talk about a little company called ChemStar. Let's talk about this company. l say go out and buy lots of it. Buy lots and lots of ChemStar. You know why? Because it's sparkly. Everybody knows that everybody loves sparkly things, so go out and buy some ChemStar because it's sparkly! Okay. Here's fresh new idea number two. These companies were so stinky l had to snip them all away. Snip! Snip! Snip! lf you're not good, you got to go! Okay. Here's fresh new idea number three! Look at that. You got YellowFin and AeroDyne. What are they doing? YellowFin and AeroDyne. They're kissing. And what does kissing usually lead to? Marriage! They're getting married! YeIIowFin and AeroDyne sitting in a tree K- l-S-S-l-N-G First comes Iove, come on Then comes marriage... - Evan. Stop. - No, don't stop me. l got more. l got more, Tom! Fresh new idea number four. NeoDyne. NeoDyne, that's your biggest holding, right? You know what fresh new thinking has to say about that company? Pull out! Pull out now. You know why? Because NeoDyne is about to have his pants pulled down and have his underwear exposed. Know what's in the underwear? - No. - Poop. Poop is in the underwear. Poop. Nasty doo-doo. Stinky ca-ca. So here's a recap. NeoDyne, pants pulled down, butt exposed, poo-poo, doo-doo, stinky ca-ca. Okay? Those are my fresh new... You take this. You hold on to it. So those are my new ideas. Thank you so much! Raining down! Fresh ideas and Walla Walla! - Did you tell them what Kupida said? - Yeah. l sure did. Did they like it? l imagine it was a lot of fun to watch, honey. Oh, God. What have l done? What have l done? ls everything okay? Hey, Ev? Stevens wants to see you. Yeah. - He just kind of flipped out. - He lost it, man. He lost it. Look, whatever you heard l said, it's probably a lot worse. - l heard you said poop. - Yeah, l said poop. Twice. Nice. l will be back in as much time as it officially takes to say, "You're fired," all right? Evan, what... Tom, l don't know what... l'm still trying to process what just happened in there. So am l, too. Really, Tom. How did you know about all those things? Listen to me, Tom. There's... What? The two companies you said were kissing. AeroDyne and YellowFin. - What did you mean by that? - l just... My brother-in-law sits on the board ofAeroDyne. For 18 months, they've been looking for a partner to offset their overseas debt. Of the literally there's only one whose financials actually made sense, and that's YellowFin. Now, how did you know about this impending marriage? - l just... - Kupida said they might get married. ChemStar. You said to buy because it was sparkly. Yes? - Yeah, okay... - A data-wire came in during the meeting. During the meeting. "ChemStar finalizes plans to expand "bauxite excavation in its New Guinea mine. "Stock up 18%." Bauxite. It's sparkIe gIue. - Sparkly. - Sparkly. NeoDyne. You said to get out. Do you remember why? - Do you? - Yes. l wrote this down. "Because their pants were coming down, "and everyone was going to see their underwear, "which was filled with poop." Yeah, l remember that. Lunchtime today, they were exposed by the SEC for corporate fraud. Pants pulled down. And their books? Total poop! So l'm asking you again. How did you know all of this? - Are you insider trading? - No. No, Tom. No way, never. Then what are you doing? Where are you getting this information? - So it's the goo-gaa? - That's how l go there. What do you mean you go there? Go where? - To where the princesses live. - Right. The princesses. That's Kupida and Qwali and all of them, right? Qwali's a queen. Kupida, Mopida and Sopida are princesses. - Okay, got you. - How many times do l have to tell you? Right. Right. Okay, let me get this right now. Now, they tell you things about companies? Well, you know what, l got a couple of other companies l want you to ask them about. Do you think they'll be up to that? You can do it yourself. l can ask them myself. l can go there with you? Yes, it'll be fun. Okay. A little more room here. - Now, l do what now? - Okay. - l take the goo-gaa. - You hold it up to your face. - Hold it up to my face. - And rub in little circles. - Okay, l'm doing it in little circles. Okay. - Like this. Now you put it over your head, like this. Okay. Now what? And you kind of call them in your mind while you spin around in circles. Okay. So l call to them in my mind while l spin in a circle. - Yeah. - Okay, l'm spinning. l'm spinning. Keep spinning. Keep spinning. l'm spinning around. Are you calling them in your mind? Yeah. Okay. So am l supposed to just keep spinning and spinning around? 'Cause l'm a tad bit nauseous now. Okay, we're there! lsn't it beautiful? Come on, Daddy! This way, into the forest! Wow. The princesses sure live in a beautiful forest. No, because this part's all burned. Yes, burned from a big forest fire. No, Sopida's dragon burnt it all. Sopida has a dragon? And if you want to get past her, you have to sing a song she likes. l gotta sing a song to Sopida's dragon, too? - Hurry. She's coming! - What? She's coming where? Sing. Sopida's dragon, please let me pass Sopida's dragon You gotta do better than that. Sopida's dragon, please let me pass Try higher. Sopida's dragon, please let... - Higher, like a mouse! - You want me to have an aneurysm? Sopida's dragon, please let me pass She very hates that. - l'm with her. - Try lower, like a frog. Okay, like a frog. Sopida's dragon, please let me pass Sopida's dragon... She very likes that. She fell asleep. Come on. Let's go. Now we can go through her cave. Duck! All right, going into the cave. That's a big, beautiful cave we're in. No, it's tiny. Can't you see? Okay. My eyes are just adjusting still. That's why... Jump, Daddy! Jump! - Jump? Why am l jumping? Okay. - Jump till you get in! Okay, you're in. - Now you're out. - Okay. What was l in? - France! - l was in France? - Now, we're on the beach. - Okay. We're on the beach now. All right. Great! ls it a nice beach here? Only 'cause mermaids give us popcorn balls. That's so nice. Thank you for the popcorn balls! Oh, no! Someone's coming! Sopida, no! Sopida, you can't! Can't what? What happened? What's going on? She doesn't trust you! She's throwing rocks at you! - Why? Why... - Duck, Daddy! Duck! l'm ducking! But what did Daddy do? Why's she throwing rocks at me? Don't know what l did. Up the path! Go back down! - This way. - Okay. Okay, we made it. There they are. Hi, Kupida! Hi, Mopida! - Hey. - Say something nice. Hey, Kupida and Mopida, how are you? Good to see you. My name is Evan Danielson, and l'm Olivia's dad. They already know who you are. Okay. lt's good to see you. You look so nice and pretty, the two of you. My, you really outdid yourself today. l'm here to ask you. l was wondering... - Are you sure they're... - Yeah. They're watching. l was gonna... l have some... l want to ask about magnesium futures and their relationship to Bolivian currency fluctuations. Specifically, these three companies, La Paz Ore and lron, and lnternational Mining and Weston Metallurgy Limited. Weston Metallurgy. These three. l was wondering if you... Can they see them? l don't want to be in your way. Okay, what are they doing? Are they talking? - Yeah. - What are they talking about? They're talking. Really? Are you sure? Okay. Yes, no, no. Did they give a reason? - Because it's fancy? - That's exactly right, sir. Fancy. But you're also saying, and this is what strikes me as contradictory, that we should abandon all interests in Weston Metallurgy. - That's correct. - Because the boliviano is going to... What did he say again? "Be a big, dumb showoff and fall off its bike." No. Trike. And nobody likes a big, dumb showoff. Well, no offense, son, but sounds to me like a load of what you just stepped in. Well, that's why we brought Mr. Whitefeather along, right? What you got, son? Mr. Rowe, that's funny. The country's entire monetary system reduced to riding around on a tricycle. That's a laugh. lt's good to laugh. lt's good to laugh, man. But there's a time to be serious. We're out here in these holy mountains that we call Rocky. They're full of predator, prey. The lion of the mountain knows when to pounce. Better watch out, jack-bunny... - Excuse me, one moment. - Yeah, okay. Love the new act, man. - Fun character. - Thank you. You know, there's an old tribal saying, "lt's not the paint that makes the warrior." - What? - Be well, brother. Be well. Evan, l ever tell you about Billy Littlesnake, a guy l used to go fishing with in Montana? l think you spared me that story. He'd go fishing where nobody else fished and always come back with 10 fat trout. Turned out he was stopping off at the market and buying them. l'm not insider trading, if that's what you're saying. Whoa, come on. Let's don't go into those woods. All right? - There's a lot of bear in those woods. - Hey, listen. Stop that thing. lf you're going to talk to me, don't do that thing you do. You want me to speak directly? l can do that. Then do it. You want to run with me, Evan, then run with me. l accept the challenge. l welcome it. But if l find out that you're stopping off at the market and buying your fat trout, l'm gonna scalp you. You're gonna scalp me. Literally? lt's gonna feel literal, yeah. Nice chatting with you, Johnny. And you, Evan. Hey, Ev, good to see you. Okay. Let me tell you something about Johnny Whitefeather. Under all the show, l'm good at what l do. l have a gift. l see trends. l see patterns. l see things no one else will ever see. Evan is good, but he's not that good. l want you to find out where he's getting his information. Sopida's dragon, please let me pass - She's in a good mood tonight. - That's great. We're all in a good mood. Let's go through the cave then! Let's get in the cave, going through the cave. Ducking down! lt's a little above my head in the cave. And now we're coming out in France. We're in France! All right. And now we're back on the beach again. On the wonderful beach with Kupida and Mopida. Hello, Kupida and Mopida! How are the princesses today? - They're good. - They're good. That's great. That's great. Hold on to this for a second, honey. - Yeah. - Okay, now. Ladies, l want to talk to you about something. First, let me tell you that those gowns you're wearing look exquisite. They look exquisite, ladies. l'll just go right out and say it. Am l looking in the right direction here? - Yeah. - Okay. l have a potential client who is in the medical field and he has a particular company. He was wondering if he should hold on to that company. And l was wondering if you ladies had any feelings about that. The company is called VallaTech. l've just been hearing so many incredible things about it. We were just wondering what you princesses thought. - What do they think? - Maybe. Maybe? Because Kupida very liked it, and Mopida very hated it. Okay, so, now what do we do? lf they disagree, we have to see Qwali, but she's at her mountain castle. Okay. Well, where's the mountain castle? There. Now, does Qwali have to be out by this bridge in front of my building, all these people all over the place, where everybody can see us? We are not by a bridge. We're at the bottom of Qwali's mountain! And there's no one here except you and me, and maybe Qwali, if she likes the way you dance. Dance? l have to dance for Qwali, too? Yeah. Because there's a ball tonight, and she has to see who is the best king. And she will not talk until she does. Okay. Well, let's do a little dance for Qwali, then. - Hey, Evan. - Hey, what's going on, man? How are you... - Okay. How's that? - Horrible. You have to get on that thing, so she can see you. Hey, look. l'm not getting up on the stage, all right? She won't talk to you. Okay, l'm gonna go get up on the stage. Oh, come on! She can't see that! She's way, way up there. Hey, all right, okay. Take it easy here. More! Bigger! Like that? Like this? No? Yes? To the beat! Can't you hear the music? To the beat? l don't hear the beat. Check it out. l hear the snickers. lt's spinning music! - Spinning, with your arms out! - You mean like a waltz? Like a waltz you're talking about. Okay. - That's the best l could do. - No, it was good. She liked it. You can go to the ball! Okay, all right. Qwali said it was good. l can go to the ball. Now, did you ask Qwali how she feels about VallaTech? Bottom line, sir, is that VallaTech is stuck up and doesn't play nice with others. l say we cut it out. - Really? - Yeah. l know this sounds a little unorthodox, but here's something else you need to know. lt has a big butt? A big ol' butt with a shelf on it. l think if you look at DarbaCon's bloated end-of-the-year rollover... ...you'll see it has pretty hair and all the boys are looking at it. Well, if he said it wets the bed, then it wets the bed. What else did he say? This little company goes wee-wee-wee-wee all the way home. - Did you say, "Wee-wee-wee-wee"? - Yes. All the way home. - And people are buying that? - By the millions. lcky, icky, icky. Gross. Yucky. Rose, is Evan seeing a psychic? Not that l'm aware of. lt's fizzy like a soda pop. - ls he a psychic? - No, l don't believe he is. lt's old enough to start wearing makeup. "Ready for makeup." You feeling this? He says your funds are mature, and now it's time to start diversifying. Specifically, for A.l., what l'm thinking is Argenteeny Pinkini. - l'm feeling that. - Hey, l want some of that. Back off, dawg. lt's mine. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! There's enough lip gloss to go around for everybody. Agroco is a crybaby who always goes running to Mommy. - That's your analysis. - Yes, it is. - And you recommend l... - Sell. - Sell the crybaby. - Sell the crybaby. ls this some kind ofjoke, Tom? - No, Carl. lt's not. - Because it seems... - l know, a little different. - A little? Why don't we hear what Mr. Whitefeather has to say? Yes. Johnny, would you like to toss some spear at some tatonka, or cast some venison into the potlatch? No, l wouldn't. l'd like to take this seriously. There's a great deal of money at stake here, Mr. Simons. l think that you should move forward on Agroco, aggressively. lncrease your holdings. And a gentleman by the name of Dante D'Enzo happens to concur with my position. His company, D.D.E. lnvestments, is looking to increase their holdings by 25%. So l think if we're going to make a move, we have to do it rather quickly. lf you're ready, l'm ready. Let's make some money. That's my "venison." Evan? Your thoughts? Well, l think that's interesting. l think that's very interesting. Very, very, very interesting that Dante D'Enzo would say in and l would say out. That's interesting, l think. What l'm going to do now is l'm gonna go to the restroom, and l'm gonna think this through, and l'm gonna re-crunch some numbers and get right back to you, gentlemen. Excuse me. So... These look great. Evan? - Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? - Flyers for Saturday. The Fall Sing. We're on lunch, so l'm just dropping them off. - Hey, how you doing? l'm Rick. - Rick. Rick's son, Henry, is in kindergarten. Yeah, so you're Rick. You're the sculpture, sculptor. l saw your little thing that you did at the Comerica building. - Yeah. - Very metallic and pointy. And unfairly criticized, l might add. Look, l got some last-minute parenting thing l gotta do with Olivia. Nice meeting you, Rick. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. lt's Mr. Danielson. - Can l talk to Olivia for one second? - Sure. l'll be brief. Olivia, come talk to Daddy, please? Hi, everybody. l have some quick questions for Qwali about Agroco. Where should we go? Come on. Come on. Come on. Okay. Did you bring the goo-gaa? All right. Okay. l knew you would. Okay, perfect, perfect, perfect. Blanket up. Rub in fast circles. l smell something burning. lt's Sopida's dragon! Here she is! Mopida and Kupida! Good to see you! Time to dance! - That's it. - What are they doing? l have no idea. - She's really sure? - And she says you agree with her. - l do? - Don't you? - Yeah, l guess l do, sort of. - Okay. Okay, give me a high five. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. Put this back in. All right, tell no one! So you're saying that Dante D'Enzo is totally wrong on this. Yes. And your inner child says that we should completely pull out ofAgroco. Yes. Okay. l think l'm going to go with what Mr. Whitefeather has put together here. lt seems better. - l am going to have the venison. - lt's a savory meat. Doctor's office. l know you say Qwali's never wrong, but l think we both were this time. lfjust Mopida says it orjust Kupida says it, it could be wrong. But if Qwali says it, it's never wrong. Well, l think she kind of was wrong this time. - She was not. - Yes, she was. - Was not. - Yes, she was. Not. Actually, not. Ha, ha, you're just trying to get me to say "was." No, she really wasn't wrong. D'Enzo pulled out ofAgroco, which is down 12%. "Agroco cries foul, hides behind parent company." Crybaby runs to Mommy. - How are you doing this? - lt's easy. You just overlap them and it makes a pyramid. Olivia? We're ready for you, sweetie. Time for your shot. You did a really good job in there. l'm really proud of you. For that, we're gonna get a special ice cream treat. - l cried, though. - But you did good. You see, when l was your age l had to get a shot, l was running, screaming, "Don't stab me! Don't stab me!" No, you wouldn't. "Don't kill me! Don't kill me, please!" How you doing, sir? What can l get you? Can we get two juice bars? - So, who wants pancakes for dinner? - l do. Yeah, that's what l say. No, we're not going to pour it yet. Put butter on it. Gotta put a small amount of butter. - You put too much butter. - No, that's enough. Looks like Sopida's dragon got to this one. - Hey! - That's gonna be your stack. You keep going here and l'll go set up the restaurant. The restaurant? What restaurant? - Allow me to tell you the specials. - Please do. Pancakes. We have kind of burnt pancakes and really burnt pancakes. Okay, well, how much for the regular? - Let me see. $3,000. - And how much for the kind of burnt? - Forty-seven cents. - Okay, let me have the kind of burnts. Let me have two kind of burnts, please. Perfect. Now do we have any condiments or anything like... What do you mean by that? You know, like syrup or some honey or some jelly or some... Anything that might cut the taste a bit. Ketchup. Chocolate syrup. Hot sauce. And mustard. You know, l would have just went with chocolate sauce or honey or... - Don't worry, it's yummier this way. - But ketchup is... Wow. That's enough ketchup. - Now would you like chocolate sauce? - Well, l guess so, yeah. - You probably would prefer it. - Yeah, wow. Yeah, let's put a lot on. Mustard. Excellent choice. Brown and yellow match perfectly. l think it's gonna add some mystery to the dish. Don't eat it yet. We got the hot sauce. Hey, where... What happened to the pancakes? There. Perfect. l think we should say our grace and eat. - Okay. - Okay. - So, you pray with Daddy now. - Okay. - Dear Lord. - Dear Lord. - Please protect my daddy's throat. - Please protect my daddy's throat. - He never done nothing to nobody, Lord. - He never done nothing to nobody, Lord. - Amen. - Amen. - And now l'm going to dig in. - Yeah, dig in. And l think it's time to ingest this pancake and be a good... Hey, look, it's Sopida. She's gone. That's the best pancake l ever had in my life! - Can l please see the bill? - Yeah, the bill? $400,000? You must be out your mind, woman! You trying to get... Tell you what! Come back here now! Come back here! Almost got you! Oh, my God! Yeah, that's a good one, too. Hold on, wait, wait, wait, don't hog the picture now. You're gonna hog the picture. Wait, the picture's not right unless Daddy's in the picture. That's magic! Come on, it's late. Okay, come on. Daddy? l'm scared about the Fall Sing on Saturday. What are you afraid of? Your mother told me you were excited about it. Well, everybody has a solo and mine is on the last song. And l start it, so if l mess up, the whole entire song is wrecked. What makes you think you're gonna mess up? l can't sing. - What do you mean you can't sing? - l can't. Yes, you can. Where's the song you're gonna sing? Let me see. l'll put it to the right page. - What song is it? - Here, this page. All right, All You Need ls Love. Okay, that's a good one. That's The Beatles. Tell you what, here's what you do. Come over here. l'm going to get you onstage here. - This is the stage. - l thought you'd play the part. No, you're gonna get on stage and l'm gonna be in the audience. This is going to be just like you're at the play. And all the people in the audience all came to see the show. We're all like, "This is great. Well, l can't wait to see the show. "Who's in the show? Well, who's that? l wonder if she can sing." You've got to get ready now. You got to get ready, see, 'cause everybody's watching, everybody's watching. And you're going to say... There's nothing you can do that can't be done - l can't. - Yes, you can! There's nothing you can do that can't be done Here's how you're singing it. You say it and then you take the last word and just stretch it out. There's nothing you can do that can't be done All right, now, here's the second line. There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung And we go higher now. There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung A little higher though. Higher. Higher. There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung My baby sounds like Minnie Riperton! Okay, let's drop it lower. Let's do it like a frog. There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung Daddy, you're just doing what l did to you. Yeah, that's right. l'm doing what you did to me. Now let's try it. There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung See, you're doing it. Okay, here's the next one. There's nothing you can say But you can Iearn how to pIay the game It's easy There's nothing you can say But you can Iearn how to pIay the game It's easy That's it! That's it! You're singing! Take a bow! She was wonderful! - You're going to the top! - Oh, stop. She's going to the top! "They finish reading. Olivia's mother gives her a kiss and says, "'You know, you really wear me out, but l love you anyway.' "Olivia gives her a kiss back and says, 'l love you anyway, too."' There you go, sleepyhead. Hey! We didn't talk to the princesses tonight. Yeah, you know what, we didn't, but that's okay. lt's quite all right. Well, maybe if you want, you can talk to them yourself. Really? On my own? Qwali says she trusts you now. That's very nice of Qwali. Tell Qwali thanks a lot. That means a lot to me. Or l could tell her myself. You want me to? Hey, you want me to? Did you fall asleep that quick? l send you out to gather pertinent information. You come back with this. But this is all he does. He just hangs out with his daughter. They sing and they dance and they laugh. They're playing with a blanket. The two of them with their faces buried in a blanket. The blanket. - It's a wakaIyapi. - Yeah. He's a sharp cat. He is a razor cat! - Say that again? - WakaIyapi. A tapestry. A weave. lt's how you access a higher eye. My people believe it's the way to achieve closeness to the Great Spirit. - Who are you calling? - You'll see. The entire Denver financial community is talking about you. But as your very first client ever, you owe it to me to tell me what the hell is going on. l told you, Maggie, l'm just listening. To the little voice that whispers to you. Yeah, right. Why don't you just tell her your secret? - Hi. Johnny Whitefeather. - l'm Margaret Johnson. Evan? Tell her the truth. Okay, Maggie, here's the truth. l have a six-year-old daughter. Now, she has what you would have to call a magic blanket. Now, with this blanket, l can be taken and be transported to a mystical, magical place where l meet with three invisible princesses and one queen. lncidentally, they all have remarkable insight to investing, except for one, who mostly wants to throw rocks at me and have me burned up by her dragon. A securities blanket. Fine, fine. Keep your secret. Just keep me in the black. l can get a blanket. l can. And l'm going to get one. l need to see you guys in my office, please. You may have noticed l've been doing things a little differently this past week, letting the two of you go head-to-head a bit more than usual. And l know you've probably heard the rumor, and it's true. There's an offer on the table, and it's big. lt's the kind of out l've been looking for. But the buyer wants to make sure that there's someone worthy to, well, to take this office. So... Here we go. Gentlemen, this is Mr. Pratt of D.D.E. lnvestments. - You're Frederick Pratt. - Yes. Yes, l am. Excuse me. - Yes, sir. - That's the suitor? Dante D'Enzo? - He's ready for you. - Hello there. Mr. D'Enzo. What an honor it is to meet you, sir. Thank you. Have a seat, gentIemen. This won't take Iong. l assume that Tom has aIready toId you about... - Mr. DanieIson, everything okay? - Yes. Yes, sir. Just had to kill the phone. lt's dead now. Okay, l assume Tom had aIready toId you that he's decided to throw away the rest of his Iife pIaying goIf. Which means one of you is going to be running the western division of D.D.E. Now, you won't be surprised to know that I've been reviewing your fiIes, and, frankIy, you're both appIying quite unorthodox methods. And I don't reaIIy care, as Iong as you get resuIts, which you seem to be doing. But, unfortunateIy, gentIemen, there's onIy one chair behind the big desk. So I have a decision to make, and I'II be stopping in Denver on my way back from Beijing tomorrow to make that decision. In the meantime, you have approximateIy 17 hours to suss out what Mr. Pratt is about to hand you. And as far as preparation is concerned, I'II just share with you the best advice that l ever heard... No, that's not the advice. The advice is, if I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax. - Abraham Lincoln. - You read my book. - Three times, sir. - lt wasn't clear the first time? No, that's not what l meant. I think I know what you meant, Mr. Danielson. AII right, gentIemen, it's 2:00 a.m. in Beijing. Do you know where your ax is? I'II see you tomorrow. May the best man win. These are a few of the strategies Mr. D'Enzo is considering. We will require your most detailed analysis and recommendations. l'll leave you with Mr. Pratt. Okay, page one. Olivia! Hey! Olivia! Big night! Big, big night tonight! Hey! Where are you? l want to talk to princesses and Qwali and all your friends! Got a lot of questions! Get to stay up late! Hey, Olivia! Hey! Where are you? Graciella, where is she? You picked her up from school, didn't you? Yes, seor. Then Mrs. Trish came and took her away. - What? When? - About one hour ago. Now, why would she do that without calling me? You know why? Because l took the battery out of my phone. Hey, listen! Hey, did Olivia leave that little blanket? - The goo-gaa? - Let me check, okay, seor? - Hello! - Trish! Hey! Evan, where are you? Olivia called you, like, five times, then she got upset and called me. And then l had to leave the pledge drive to make sure... lt's a long story. l took the battery out of my phone. But, listen, you'll never guess who l was just talking to. Not now, Evan. l'm at the party. - The party? What party? - Ella's party. - Which you obviously forgot about. - Forgot it. Forgot all about the party. Okay, listen, tell Olivia l'm gonna be there in 20 minutes to pick her up. Why? I'm aIready here. Look, you did your week. l'll just stay here and take her to Ella's for the sleepover. Sleepover! No, no, no. l don't know if a sleepover works for me tonight, Trish. l actually need Olivia here with me. Here with me and her blanket, yes. Her what? Listen, l know this is going to sound a little crazy. l know this is going to sound a little wild, but the fact of the matter is... l need... l need the goo-gaa. l don't have a response for that, Evan. - No, Trish, Iisten. - l'm hanging up now. - Bye. - No, no, no, Trish, Trish, Trish! Okay, if you're here for EIIa's birthday party, make your way to the orange sIide and into the Kidz Only zone for some Fo Fo FiggIey fun. Olivia! - Trish, you want me... - No, l'll deal with this. Olivia! Evan, what is going on? What are you doing here? l know, l know. Everything's fine. Everything's cool. Look, where did she go just now? She went into the Kidz Only room. What is this, Evan? Nothing. Everything's fine. Everything's cool. - Hey. How we doing over here? - What's going on? How you? l'm good. Trish, do you mind helping Lori with the cake for me? Yeah, help Lori with the cake, and l'm gonna do what l was going to do. - lt's my daughter's seventh birthday! - Congratulations. You're going to think this is hilarious, but l got to go get Olivia's blanket for, like, six hours. - You need her blanket. - Yes, l need her blanket. l see, so that's what you're here for, to cause a scene. l'm not trying to cause a scene at all. You're making it a scene by stopping me from going to get the blanket. You should just let me go get the blanket, and there's no scene at all. - Let me talk to you for a second. - What's the problem? Now we've all seen what happens when you take Liv's blanket, right? - Okay, that's duly noted. - And now is not the time nor place for it. Let me explain something to you. Let me say something. What l'm going to do is going to take all of 10 seconds. l'm gonna get the blanket, and l'm going to be gone. And that's the end of the deal, you know what l'm saying, John? Let me do my thing. Hey, what's the matter with you? John... Hey, what's up with the football block, man? - Hey, be cool. - You be cool, okay? l am being cool. l just need the goo-gaa! Okay, when a grown man says "goo-gaa," it's time to go. Okay, all right. Okay, all right. lt's cool. All right. You made your point. You got it. You gotta be cool. l'll tell her you said happy birthday. Yeah. She'll be touched. Hey, John. ls everything okay? - l took care of it. He's gone. - What did you say? Don't worry about it. l put my foot down, okay? That's the last we're gonna see of Evan today. You wanna play, boy? Man, stop. No, you didn't. Hey, little brother. Hey, brother. Hey, my man. Hey, little man. Hey, why don't you do me a favor? l want you to go into the Kidz Only room and talk to Olivia Danielson and tell her her dad's out here. l'm gonna give you $20. Go in there and tell her that her dad's out here - and needs the goo-gaa. - A what? lt's a goo-gaa. lt's a pet name for the blanket. l need the blanket. Just go in, tell Olivia Danielson her dad's out here and get the blanket. $20, man. Come on, brother. - l'll take $50, my brother. -50? Or you can take your grown self up there and get the goo-gaa on your own. Hey, stop it! l'm not in here to play with you kids. Stop it! Look, man, l haven't been to the cash machine. All l got is $26 in here. See, that's more than half of $50. And l got this. A Peet's Coffee card. l got $15 worth of credit on it. You know how much coffee you can get for $15? You drink that coffee, you just keep playing and playing and playing! - l'm a kid. l don't drink coffee. - They got other things. They got cookies and cakes and scones. You like scones? Scones? What do l look like, the Queen of England? Hey, you stop that right now! l'm not here to play with you! - l'm talking to this child! - That's a nice Rollie. Yes, that is a nice Rollie, and you just back on up. You're not getting my Rollie. Come on, man. This is $26. $26, a Peet's Coffee card. That's some easy money. You want it or not? Not. Get this fool! Hey, stop it right now! Grandfather, will you bless the blanket? Here's the... This guy? The blanket works best through the innocence of a child. Okay. Good. Thank you. - lndigo! Wake up, buddy. Hey! Hey! - What? What? Wake up. You're going on a vision quest. - l don't wanna. l'm tired. - Well, you're gonna. Your new tribal name, Red Bull. Okay, l got this. l can do this. l'm thinking it through, and l'm letting it flow. And l can do this, and l do not need the goo-gaa. Let it flow, Evan. Just let it flow. Okay, l know this company. Yes. l don't know this company. No. l don't need the goo-gaa, l don't need the goo-gaa, 'cause this is what l do. Look at that. All right, how you feel? How you feel? - l'm still tired. - Yeah, you're still tired? Get up there. Hey, what is this? The relationship of this currency to this company five years out. Maybe if you want, you can talk to them yourself. This is a wakalyapi, okay? Star blanket. l need you to feel the magic.

Look, l don't know what's happening. l know something's happening. l need for it to happen one more time tonight. So, now we're back to what you need. Hey, Trish, what do you want me to do? Blow off an opportunity l've been waiting for since grad school and lose my job? Evan, you have two jobs, and one of those jobs is being a father. And she needs to know that you care as much about that job as you do the other. - l do. Of course l do. - Then leave the blanket. l can't. Not tonight, l can't. l don't expect you to understand. How you doing, Feather Man? Pretty good, brother. How you doing? Not so bad. A little amped, a little tired. Ain't nothing but a thing. How about another Red Bull?

Buy long, sell short. - Sell short, buy long. - Hi. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fall Sing. It's so good to see so many of you here today. WeII, I can hear a Iot of very excited chiIdren back there, who, Iike their parents, are not here to Iisten to me continue taIking. So without further ado, the wonderful Chilton School choir. Summer fades into the blue Brand new colors come into view Seasons change I have, too Just like the leaves of autumn You know what l see in this room that nobody else sees? Hidden feathers. That's what we share, hidden feathers! Crow feathers. Right now, l need you to caw with me. One crow to another crow. Bring it. Come on. Bring it in. l know you want to let it out, but l appreciate you keeping it in. There it be, brother crow. Look forward to working with you, man. Wow. l've never seen anything like that before. l know. No, you don't know. Quite frankly, that's one of the biggest loads of crap l've ever heard. What possible excuse can you give us for wasting our time with that unctuous stream of drivel that you call a presentation? - My kid. - What? My kid. He's been wanting to get more involved in my workplace life. He's like, "Dad, l'm on a vision quest. l got some investment ideas." l'm like, "You're nine. How many good ideas could you have?" He's on a vision quest. l'm like, "Vision quest, my red butt! But..." You're blaming your child? - Look, don't let it rattle your corn stalk... - All right, enough! l don't mind this lndian business when it's working. - When it's not, it's just annoying. - Whoa! - That's deep shadow time. - Seriously, cut the crap. You're not even a real Native American. The fact is you're mostly Finnish-Armenian. Your baptismal name is Johann Hasuvian. And your great-grandfather was one half Navajo. So, what would that make you? 1/32? Frankly, you are an offense to true Native Americans, - and if you have nothing better to offer... - All right, all right. Johnny Whitefeather can see which way this wind's blowing. lt's your loss! Old croaking toad. l'm going this way! Well, Mr. Danielson? Looks like this job is yours to lose. l'll get right to it. Mr. Danielson? Evan? l can't do this. l'm sorry? l messed up. l really have. Sorry, what? - Are you walking out? - l'm really sorry, sir. l just can't. You realize what you're giving up? Yes, sir, l do. Sorry, Tom. Could l see that brochure, please? Ain't nothing but a thing, man. Next, we wiII sing a traditionaI Japanese foIk song about the bIooming of the cherry blossom, the Sakura. Sorry! Sorry about that! The next song is one you aII know, so feeI free to sing aIong.

You know, you were really great in there. - Thanks. - Hey, listen, l got something for you. - l don't need it anymore. - Really? l was hoping you would take it, and, you know, you'd help me apologize to the princesses. - You can do it yourself. - l can? Yeah, they're right there. Okay. Well... Sopida, l wish that l could say you were wrong about me, but, obviously, you and your dragon knew better. l'm sorry. Thank you for protecting Olivia while l was away. And Kupida and Mopida, l'm sorry for taking you for granted and just expecting things from you and not realizing how smart and kind and truly amazing you really are. Qwali, thank you so much for letting me come into your mystical, magical world, - 'cause it's a truly magical... - Daddy, they're leaving. They got bored. They were bored. Do you want me to ask them to stay? Well, what do they want to do? They said it's time for them to go. Well, then l think they should go then. Wave goodbye. There they go. Hey, guys. What you doing? Just waving goodbye to Qwali and the princesses. Really? They're going away? How about that? You know, l think there's somebody here to see you. Wow, so, they're really gone? Nice outfit. l take it this is why you walked out of our meeting. Do you know how many people have ever done anything like that to me? - Two. - Two. You want to know where they are in their careers right now? Each one is running a key division of my company. l don't want any sycophants around me. l want people with confidence who are not afraid to make decisions, even under pressure. lncidentally, this is very good. You are very good indeed, and l want you to head our western division. l'd like to discuss that with you, so, please... Sir, l would love to discuss it now, but it's Saturday. Sure. - Well, Monday, then. - Monday. - Well, congratulations. - Thank you very much. l have a daughter, too. l haven't seen her for years. - So, have a pleasant Saturday. - You, too, sir. So, what are you guys doing with the rest of the day? l don't know. What do you want to do? l think Mommy should get a chance to try some of your special pancakes.
