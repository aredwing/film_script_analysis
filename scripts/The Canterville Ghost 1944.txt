AND THAT'S THE DOOR TO HIS BEDCHAMBER BEHIND THAT TAPESTRY, ISN'T IT, MRS. UMNEY? YES. HE WAS WALLED UP IN THERE CENTURIES AGO. HOLY CATFISH! THAT'S AWFUL. YES, AND EVERY NIGHT NOW, ON THE STROKE OF 12:00, HIS GUILTY SPIRI COMES THROUGH THAT DOOR AND WALKS THE HALLS, SUPPOSEDLY IN SEARCH OF A KINSMAN, THEN GOES BACK AGAIN. OH. NO KIDDING. OH, GENTLEMEN, BEWARE. I'VE SEEN THINGS WITH MY OWN EYES THAT WOULD MAKE ANY CHRISTIAN'S HAIR STAND ON END. I'LL BE YOU HAVE. I'VE READ ALL ABOUT I IN A BIG BOOK AUNTIE'S GOT IN THE GATEHOUSE.

WELL, RECORD OR NO RECORD, AS LONG AS HER LADYSHIP'S AROUND, YOU'VE GOT TO BEHAVE YOURSELF. IT IS ABSURD, ASKING ME TO BEHAVE MYSELF, QUITE ABSURD. I MUST RATTLE MY CHAINS AND GROAN THROUGH KEYHOLES. I MUST GIBBER FROM THE ORIEL WINDOW ON THE FIRST AND THIRD WEDNESDAYS IN EVERY MONTH. IT IS MY SOLEMN DUTY TO WALK THESE HALLS. WELL, IN THAT CASE, YOU'D BETTER GET YOURSELF ANOTHER CASTLE FOR THE DURATION, BROTHER. BUT CUFFY, HE CAN'T. HE'S THE FAMILY GHOST. AMERICANS, CHILD. WHAT CAN A PEOPLE WITHOU ANCESTORS KNOW ABOUT GHOSTS? NOW, WAI A MINUTE. I TAKE IT YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN OR RED GRANGE, THE GALLOPING GHOST. PROVINCIAL STUFF. SPIRITS WITH NEITHER CREST NOR TITLE. OH, WE HAVE TITLES, TOO- PRINCE MIKE ROMANOFF, COUNT BASIE, DUKE ELLINGTON. YOU DON'T SAY SO. MM-HMM. NOBILITY IN A DEMOCRACY. BALDERDASH. BUT, MR. GHOST- I MEAN, SIR SIMON- WE'VE HAD DEMOCRACY HERE IN ENGLAND EVER SINCE THE MAGNA CARTA, BUT I HAVE NEVER CHOSEN TO RECOGNIZE IT. BUT YOU SHOULD, SIR SIMON. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING THIS WAR ABOUT, MY AUNTIE SAYS. THAT'S THE STUFF, MY LADY! YOU SEE? YOU'RE NOT SCARED A BIT. OH...

UNLESS YOU'D RATHER BE ALONE. OH, NO, NO. PLEASE, PRAY SIT DOWN. I'VE FORGOTTEN MY MANNERS. WELL, IF I MAY SAY SO, YOU COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE POLITE TO CUFFY JUST NOW. AFTER WHAT HE AND HIS BAND OF HOOLIGANS DID TO ME? I MAY HAVE VERY LITTLE ELSE, BUT I STILL HAVE MY PRIDE. MAYBE THEY WOULDN' HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO YOU IF YOU HADN' FRIGHTENED THEM. WHAT ELSE IS THERE FOR ME TO DO? I AM A GHOST. I MUST FRIGHTEN PEOPLE. AND I HAVE A REPUTATION TO UPHOLD. THE MOST FEARSOME PHANTOM IN ALL ENGLAND CANNOT- BUT CUFFY TOLD ME THAT THEY CHASED YOU UP THE CHIMNEY LAST NIGHT. THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE THOSE HOOLIGANS HAD... LADY JESSICA... I CANNOT PRETEND ANY LONGER. SINCE LAST NIGHT, IT IS I WHO AM FRIGHTENED, I WHO TREMBLE A THE SLIGHTEST NOISE. POOR, POOR GHOST. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GHOST, NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, DAY AFTER DAY, TO LIVE IN EMPTINESS BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH WITH NOTHING FOR COMPANY BUT YOUR BITTER MEMORIES? BUT DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP ON BEING A GHOST? I AM CONDEMNED TO BE A GHOS UNTIL A KINSMAN PERFORM A BRAVE DEED IN MY BEHALF. I HAVE WALKED THESE HALLS FOR THREE CENTURIES, AND I'M SO TIRED. IF ONLY I COULD REST. IF ONLY I COULD DIE. TO BE BURIED IN THE SOFT, BROWN EARTH IN THE GARDEN BEYOND THE PINE WOODS, TO HAVE NO YESTERDAY AND NO TOMORROW, TO FORGET TIME, TO BE AT PEACE. OH, DEAR. I WISH I COULD DO A BRAVE DEED FOR YOU. HOW GOES IT, LADY? OH, FINE. SORRY TO BUST UP THIS LITTLE REUNION, BUT THE LOOEY WILL BE BACK IN A MINUTE. GOOD-BYE, SIR SIMON. I'M VERY HAPPY TO HAVE MET YOU. CUFFY, I THINK YOU OUGH TO TELL YOUR FRIENDS NOT TO CHASE HIM UP THE CHIMNEY ANYMORE. WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON HIM. BUT HE'S SO OLD AND SO TIRED. HUH! EXCUSE ME, MY LADY. SEE YOU LATER. SIR SIMON, I JUST SAW- CUFFY HAS THE CANTERVILLE MARK ON HIS NECK. WHAT? EXACTLY LIKE MY FATHER HAD. THAT AMERICAN RUFFIAN? ISN'T IT WONDERFUL? HE MUST BE A CANTERVILLE. EGAD, AND WHAT IF HE BE A CANTERVILLE? SHALL I PRANCE JOYOUSLY AROUND LIKE A SAUCY ANTELOPE? BUT, SIR SIMON, IF HE IS A KINSMAN, AND IF HE DOES A BRAVE DEED IN YOUR NAME, HE CAN SAVE YOU, CAN'T HE? CAN IT BE THAT THEY HAVE CONCEALED FROM THEE WHY I AM STILL HERE? DOST FANCY 'TIS BECAUSE I CANNOT FIND A KINSMAN? WELL, I HEARD MR. POTTS SAY THAT THE CANTERVILLES ALWAYS TURNED OUT TO BE COWARDS. IS IT THAT? COWARDS? GROSS FLATTERY. HAD THEY TWICE THE COURAGE, 'TWOULD ONLY GIVE THEM HALF THE NAME. THY GRANDFATHER, WOULD HE MOUNT A HORSE? THY FATHER, SO FEARFUL OF WATER THAT HE TREMBLED IN HIS BATH... OR THYSELF, SWOONING A THE MERE SIGHT OF MY SHADOW. REALLY, NOW! IT'S YOUR FAMILY, TOO, SIR SIMON! ONLY TOO WELL DO I KNOW. BUT, SIR SIMON, WAIT. CUFFY CAN SAVE YOU. I KNOW IT. IT ISN'T TRUE THAT ALL CANTERVILLES HAVE TO BE COWARDS. HAVEN'T I LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW? I WAS A COWARD, WASN'T I? I WAS FRIGHTENED TO DEATH OF YOU. NOW LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME! I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU ANYMORE, NOT IN THE LEAST. DON'T YOU SEE, SIR SIMON? NAY, NAY. 'TWAS IN THEIR BLOOD AND BONES. IT ISN'T IN MY BLOOD AND BONES, AND IT ISN' IN CUFFY'S. YOU CAN TELL HE'S BRAVE JUST BY LOOKING AT HIM. OH, SIR SIMON, I'LL ARRANGE FOR YOU TO MEET HIM AGAIN, AND IF IT TURNS OUT THA HE IS A CANTERVILLE... MY GOODNESS! PERHAPS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GO TO SLEEP IN THE GARDEN BEYOND THE PINE WOODS AFTER ALL. PLEASE, SIR SIMON. VERY WELL, CHILD. SIR SIMON, WHERE ARE YOU? HERE, HERE. GOOD EVENING, SIR SIMON. I BROUGHT HIM. SIR? HOW ARE YOU, SIR SIMON? WHAT'S COOKING? COOKING? YEAH. I MEAN, WHAT'S ALL THE MYSTERY? THE SERGEANT WILL HAVE THE BLOODHOUNDS AFTER ME IF I'M NO IN THE HAY BY 9:00. AND AUNTIE WILL BE AFTER ME IF SHE FINDS OU I'M NOT IN BED. GO ON, SIR SIMON, ASK HIM. WELL, TELL ME, PRITHEE... OH, YES. I AM AWARE THAT FEW AMERICANS KNOW THEIR OWN GRANDFATHERS, BUT DOST THOU BY ANY MIRACLE REMEMBER AUGH OF THINE ANCESTORS? ANCESTORS? MY OLD MAN WOULD NEVER LOOK INTO HIS. SAID HE WAS SCARED HE MIGHT TURN UP ONE THAT ENDED UP ON THE HOT SEAT. HOT SEAT? NOWADAYS, ENGLAND AND AMERICA HAVE EVERYTHING IN COMMON EXCEPT, OF COURSE, THE LANGUAGE. SIR SIMON! THINK BACK, CUFFY, PLEASE. TRY TO REMEMBER. WE DON'T GO IN MUCH FOR THAT SORT OF THING IN THE STATES. WAIT A MINUTE. I HAD AN AUNT MARTHA. SHE WAS A LITTLE WACKY ON THE SUBJECT. ONCE, SHE DID TRACE MY MOTHER'S FAMILY TREE BACK AS FAR AS SOME GUY THA LANDED IN MASSACHUSETTS WAY, WAY BACK. HIS NAME WAS, UH, MARMALADE- NO, NO. MARMADUKE. MARMADUKE.

WILT WEAR MY SIGNET, KINSMAN, AND CARRY IT INTO BATTLE IN MY BEHALF? WELL, I DON'T KNOW, NOW. SEE, UH... A COLONIAL RUFFIAN LIKE ME SAVING A BLUE BLOOD LIKE YOU? OH, BUT, CUFFY, YOU MUST SAVE HIM. HE'S SO TIRED AND SLEEPY. I COULDN'T EAT MY SUPPER TONIGHT FROM WORRYING OVER HIM. BESIDES, THOU ART A CANTERVILLE THYSELF, THE BLUEST BLOOD IN ALL BROAD ENGLAND. THE BLUEST BLOOD, HUH?
