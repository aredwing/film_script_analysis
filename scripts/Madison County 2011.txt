Well, then looks like all we got left are the girls. Are they ready? Yeah, I just called. Told them we're on our way. Sounds good. Hey, Will. Yeah? I really appreciate you coming out on this trip with us. Oh, it's no problem, man. So we gonna have fun, or what? I guess. Come on, man, are we gonna have fun? You know it. Well, let's hit it! Um... Is Brooke here? I'm sorry. You must be Kyle. We couldn't have chosen a more rainy day. This weather, huh? Brooke! If I had nickel for every time... Right. Looks like you two hit it off. Yeah. He almost caught me sneaking her out of the house in high school. Apparently he hasn't forgotten about it. Hey, whoa! Hey, Jenna. Hey, James. Will, you know Jenna, right? Yeah. Of course. Hi. All packed up? Yeah, yeah, just one second. That was a pretty enthusiastic greeting. What're you talking about? Whoa! You two still have something going on? Maybe. Why? Don't bullshit me. I'm not. I'm not bullshitting you. You're doing that face you do when you lie. Okay. All right. It's a small thing. Let's not make it into a big thing, okay? What the hell is he doing? I'm so sorry. You can't be serious. He fucking hates me. You... You didn't tell about us, did you? You serious? He'd freak out. We've got it under control. Daddy didn't know that Will was going. He's not too fond of you, Will. Great. Chill. Just chill. It's okay. Hey. Heard you're coming along? Yeah. All right. It's good to have you, man. Will, what brings you along? Well, James asked me to come along and take some photos while you guys conduct your interview. Interview? What interview? That's what we're doing actually. We're going to Madison County to interview an author. Why? Well, I've been writing letters back and forth with this guy for a few weeks now. He invited us out to interview him for my thesis paper. I thought we'd make a trip out of it. There's a lot of controversy around the book actually. It's about a guy named Damien Ewell. According to the author, David Randall, he killed around 33 people over the course of a couple of decades. No one in the town told anyone. Is this true? David Randall claims it is. But no one believes him, right? I'm not sure. I mean, that's part of the interview. I want to get the people's point of view on the whole situation. So about how far away is this? It's a good half day drive. The only way to get to it is through the hills, so lots of twists, and turns. Hope nobody gets motion sickness. I guess this is a good chance to get out and stretch if anyone needs to. Anybody need anything to drink? I'll take a water. Water. Anybody else? All good. How about you, Kyle? You want a hotdog or something? Thank you. Who's that? You need a jump? No, sir. We're just waiting on our friend over here to get his sea legs. Oh, I see. Where are you headed? We're actually headed to Madison County. What're you doing going there? Well, we're gonna write this, like, paper... We're actually headed that way to get to the Mulberry. Gonna do some canoeing. Oh. Where are your canoes? Uh, we're gonna rent 'em down at the entrance. Smart man. Yes, sir. All right, y'all take care. You know, there's a road that you could take just before the 16. Save you almost 30 minutes. Oh, yeah? Yeah, and it's not as hilly either. Be good for your friend over there. It's called Pettigrew. All right, I appreciate that. No problem. Y'all take care. So, how'd you get a hold of this guy? Well, I contacted him from the address on the back of the book. But it took him a while to get back to me. Does he write you often? Yeah, yeah, kind of. I mean, it usually takes him a few days to get back to me each time though. Why don't you just e-mail, call? I would, but he doesn't have a phone or a computer. God, that's gotta be awful. Can you imagine the privacy? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Do you want me to come with you? No, I'm a big girl. I can go by myself. So, James, are you finally going to make your move? What are you talking about? Oh, my God, don't play dumb. She's into you. Really? What'd she say? Hey, I can't break the code of girl talk. But I definitely think she likes you. Don't act like it's some kind of surprise, okay? Yeah. So, what's the plan for tomorrow? Kyle. No, no, it's fine. Well, when we get into town, we're gonna talk to some of the people before going out to David's place. There. Happy? So. About Jenna. I really think that you should just... What're you guys talking about? Nothing. Do it. Thanks. Thanks for the help. You're... Ow! What the... Hell, my... Hey, James. Yes, ma'am? I was wondering, you didn't happen to notice anyone else here camping last night, did you? No. Not that I know of. Why? No reason. It's just I saw a car leaving earlier this morning. It looked like the one from last night. Well, we are still kind of close to the highway. I know. You don't think that guy had any bad intentions yesterday, do you? Nah, he seemed friendly enough. I figure if he was going to do us any harm, he would've done it last night. Yeah, you're probably right. Hey! What the fuck are you doing? Oh, what you thought I was actually going to take that road? Why not? What are the chances of that guy telling us it's faster, we take it and then get completely lost? You've got a point. So, Kyle, do you have a girlfriend? No. No, no, don't let him fool you. He's got lots of lady friends. Who knows, Kyle, maybe we can find you a little hillbilly girl to hang out with out here, huh? What about you, Brooke? No. No boyfriend for me at the moment. I'm probably going to grad school. You know, trying to keep my options open. Really? Yeah, why? Just never really talked about that. Well, it's something that I've been thinking about by myself. Hey can you pull over soon? I have to pee. Hey, I'm gonna go in those trees. I'm gonna come keep a look out. No. No, no. I'll be fine. I'll be within earshot. Got to take a piss anyway. Oh, there we go. Oh, come on, man! Oh, no, don't "come on" me, that's cute. Go on. There we go. Oh! Okay, rub his belly. Okay, now go lower. Just kidding. Wonderful work, ladies and gentlemen. Those ought to be good. Maybe. Just because he's a good photographer. So, what's the story with Will? He seems like a nice guy. Oh, he's a great guy. We met in high school. Always had a camera in his hand. Yeah, you two seem to be really good friends. Yeah, we are. Well, it was actually his idea to come out here and take pictures to go with my thesis. Pretty interesting, huh? Not really. Hey, Brooke, you ready? Holy shit! What was that? I'm sorry, baby. I just thought we'd have a little bit of fun while we're out here in the middle of nowhere. That's not exactly the kind of fun I had in mind. What kind of fun did you have in mind? Do you wanna fuck right here in the woods? Uh-huh. You know, I do have the camera. Uh-huh. Mmm. Psych. What do you mean, psych? What? Is it the rain? You fell for it. Yes. It's too wet to do that here. It can get a lot wetter out here. Ah! What? What the fuck? - Come on. - What was that? What was what? I heard a noise. Hang on. Will, I heard a noise. I didn't hear anything. What the fuck were you doing with my sister? Kyle, stop! Were you spying on her? No, this isn't what it looks like. No, Kyle! Come on. Stop! No, I wasn't. Let me see your camera. Why? Because I want to see the camera. Why? I want to see the fucking camera. Let me see the goddamn pictures. I'll show you the pictures. Stop it. Give me the fucking camera. Stop it! Ahhh! Whoa! Whoa! What happened? This fucking pervert was spying, probably taking pictures of Brooke. No, I wasn't. You know what? This guy is fucking nuts. You're fucking kidding me. Hey! Hey! Kyle, chill. Will wouldn't do that. I don't know, what the fuck he would do. Will's my boyfriend, Kyle! All right? We've been seeing each other for months. What... What? It's true. You need to chill out, Kyle. Let's just drop it, okay? There's no sense in getting pissed at each other. Let's get back to the car. We've gotta keep moving. - Fuck! - You okay? Phew! You really know how to pick a place, you know that, James? So, we're here now. Where do we go? Hungry? Starving. Let's stop and get some food. If we can find a place. Why is everyone staring at us? I don't know. Hi, ma'am. Hi there, young man. What can I do for you? We were wondering if we could get some food? Certainly. What would you like? Just whatever. Burgers, fries, and sodas for all 5 of us. Of course. Uh, ma'am, do you have veggie burgers? She's a vegetarian. No, I'm sorry. We don't get many of those around here. I'll just have some fries. That'll be $15. What? That's it? Thank you. Let me ask you something. Why does everyone here have a staring problem? Well, it's because we don't get many strangers around here. Oh, yeah? Why is that? Well, there are a lot of folks who don't like people they don't know around them and their families, and farms and such. Jeez, paranoid much? Well, we mean you no harm. No. I'm sure. Why don't you kids have a seat. Your food will be ready in a few minutes. So, ma'am... Erma. Erma. Uh, you wouldn't happen to know David Randall would you? David Randall... Hmm. Nope. Sorry, doesn't ring a bell. Well, he's the writer of this book, Devil in the Woods. Oh, that David Randall. Yes, ma'am. What can you tell me about him? He's long gone, as far as I know. What about Damien Ewell? Oh, Damien Ewell's just a made-up person. Doesn't exist, just like that book. But the letters. I've been getting letters. Oh! Someone was playing a prank on you. All right. Thanks. So, what'd she say? She says, David isn't here and Damien isn't real. You're joking, right? Please tell me we didn't come all the way down here for someone who isn't real. He is real. And David is here. I have the letters to prove it. Well, I guess we're gonna need more than that. What are you doing? I'm going outside. I'm coming too. So, where are we going? I don't know, I just wanted to see what was down here. Oh, I wonder who these belong to. Damien. They're his trophies. Oh, look, there's a nice spot for a car right over there. Uh, do you think she was telling the truth about David? I don't know. She seemed a little off. I can't believe he lives out here. He's like a hermit. Yeah. Maybe he's a lone rider kinda guy. You know, like your brother. Um... I'm sorry about him, earlier. No, no. Don't be. He overreacts sometimes. No. The guy doesn't like me. That's not overreacting. Dad's told him some stuff that he's heard about you. Bad reputations never leave you in small towns, do they? Well, what's my reputation? You are the cute, innocent girl next door that got swept away by the dashing rebel. Then why am I with you? Because I'm irresistible. Mmm-hmm. Uh-huh. And I'm going to use that to win over your dad and he's going to love me too. And you think that'll work? Yeah. I'm gonna make it work. Because I don't want Kyle tagging along on our honeymoon. Not funny. Funny? You should have heard what I was going to say. Will, come on. We're leaving! Duty calls. You're ready to go? Mmm-hmm. - Where you've been? - So what's the plan? We're gonna go to David's house. I got the woman to tell me where the address is. And we're going to trust some old lady who lives in the middle of the woods? Got no other choice. Let me get a quick shot of the diner. Oh! Sorry. What exactly are you takin' pictures of? My friends and I are doing a write-up on Madison County. - Is that so? - Mmm-hmm. Well, you see this is my truck right here, and I don't appreciate you takin' pictures of it. Well, you see, I don't want anything to do with you or your truck. So why don't you move it out of my shot? Want to say that again? It'd be in your best interest to put that knife away. You kids best be getting out of here while you still can. He'll be gettin' wind of you soon and when he does... Shit. Thank you. I can't believe you did that. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Did you see that? Yeah. I think we should leave. We're not leaving. That guy pulled a knife on us, James! You've never seen a knife before? People get robbed daily in big cities, and they don't move away. No, that doesn't make it any better, James. We're staying. We leave now, then all that shit we just went through was for nothing. Will got a knife pulled on him. So what? You get your interview, you get your pictures, and we get the hell out of here. If we leave now, we're making a bigger deal than it should be. We'll just try to stay out of harm's way... Look out! What the fuck? What the fuck was that? Fuck who it was, we almost hit him! Did you not see his face? Yeah, it's called inbreeding. And we'd mellow out in the light of the sun We will ride tonight With evil spirits we'll fight To protect our land To protect our kin They have their full might on this full moon night But we'll make 'em understand On this land we stand On the full...  Do you think it's safe? I don't wanna get shot at or anything like that. No, we'll be fine. Come on. Hello? Anybody home? Hello? Hey! Open up! Let's go. No one's home. Let's leave. So we drove all this way to grab some food and knock on someone's door? Sounds like something I would say. Because it's stupid. We're not leaving. Then what are we supposed to do? We need to go back to the diner, get more information from those people. I'll go. What? I'll go back to the diner. Shouldn't we stay together? Obviously, he can take care of himself. Look, I'll be fine. Ask to use their phone when you get there. Yeah, no problem. Hey, Kyle! Here, take the car. It'll be faster. Just be careful. Hi there, young man. Hi. Um... You said 1201 Country Lane is a few miles down the road. One with the gated drive, right? Yes, sir. There's no one there. Of course not. He left about the time his book came out. Did Damien Ewell kill him? Oh! I told your friend, Damien Ewell is a made-up character. Where would he get the ideas for the book if it's not true? People's imaginations run wild sometimes. People around here, they didn't like it much that he was telling stories about them, right? He made small town people look bad. Does David have any family in the area that we can visit? No, his family is all passed, many years ago. Would you mind telling me where the nearest cemetery is? Not at all. Hey, what about that barn down there? Should we go look around? It might have something with his name on it. You know, it could be where Damien took the dead body of David Randall. Doubtful. Wait. Why, you don't think this guy's dead? Not if he's been sending me letters, no. Where is he? And why does everyone around here act like they don't know this guy? I don't know. I'll tell you why? It's because they're covering something up. Well, what does the book say? May I? Here we go, story of Damien Ewell. "Damien was the most dangerous, undiscovered serial killer in America. "He killed an estimated "And no one ever said a word about it." What the fuck, man? "He was born in the 1970s. "His mother was a great and loving woman, "until one day, she met a man that was from out of town. "He eventually moved in "and became the closest thing "Damien ever had to a father. "But they still didn't get along." Hey, are you okay? I saw you was up here snoopin'. You ain't with them police, is you? Police? No. What police? They was looking for the missing girl. Have anything to do with Damien Ewell? I reckon so. "Around the age of 11 Damien ran away from home "and was found days later on the side of the road, left for dead. "One of the people in the town found him. "He was badly disfigured. "He'd been tortured to within an inch of his life. "They took him home and from there, "the townspeople became very paranoid. "Someone had hurt one of their own." Did they ever find out who did it? It was his mother's boyfriend. That sounds made-up. It's not. What happened to him? He died. Well, did someone kill this guy, the boyfriend? It doesn't say. Well, that's great. And here we are, asking people questions, I'm sure they don't want to give the answers to. You said something about a girl. What girl? Her daddy was sure Damien did it. Do you know Erma? Don't you get it? They was the ones that was in on it. What do you mean? Hey, I'm not snooping. Hey, where are you going? You guys go down to the end of the driveway. We'll check the barns and the house. Huh! Great. Come on, let's go poke around. So, what are we looking for? Honestly? I'm not even sure. Who would've ever thought it would be this much trouble to interview a person? Yeah. No joke. You know it would be really easy to just pack up and go home. So you're siding with Brooke and Will now? No. It just seems like a lot to go through just to write a paper, don't you think? And wouldn't it be a huge waste of time to pack up, drive all the way out here, and turn around and go home after just a couple of hours? Touche. So, Jenna, what brings you all the way out to Madison County? Well, once upon a time there was a really nice guy named James who sat behind me in my English class. Really now? Yeah, he dragged me all the way out here to write a paper on some book I've never read. Why didn't you read the book? Because I've got better things to do with my time. Okay. And what did you think of this James guy? He was a bit of a pig, actually. Oh, yeah? How so? Well, occasionally, I would catch him staring at my ass in class. And you saw him doing this? I sure did. And how come you never brought this to his attention? Because I told you earlier, I didn't mind. Hey! It's open. Should we go in? Yeah, yeah, I am. You can stay here if you want. Hello? Hello? Holy shit! Look at this. Is that the guy from the highway? Looks like him, doesn't it? It says David. Do you think that means David Randall? I can't imagine who else it would be. What's this? Daddy, Erma, David and Damien. Hey, Brooke! Jenna, is that you? This place definitely has a lot of... - Sorry. - Stop. Let's check this out over here. Shit. Jesus! Looks like a mangled dungeon master lives here. Looks like someone still lives here. Yeah. Don't do that. It's okay. This is turning into so much work. I thought this was going to be a nice trip for us. It will, it will. As soon as we're done with James' stuff, we'll get out of here, okay? We'll spend a few relaxing days in the woods. Just you and me. Can my brother come? That's not funny. Oh, that's weird. Hey guys, where'd you go? Hey! Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. I wonder why Kyle's not back yet. Do you think he got lost? Maybe. I think I'd better go find him. Well, you're not leaving me here. It'll be fine. I'll just run down there, it'll be quicker if I'm by myself. What, are you trying to call me fat or something? There's not an ounce of fat on your body. Go catch up to Will and Brooke. I'll meet you guys back up here. Jenna? Yeah? Be careful. Oh, I'm Kyle. What's your names? All right. Fuck me, man. Mind if I join you guys down there? What, me? Smells really weird in here. Musty. That's quite an antler collection he's got. Look at this. What are you going to do with that? I don't know. Bend over, I'll show you. Will! Come on? Yeah, I think I'm going to hold on to this. In case we run into any bears or maybe I get a base hit. Get out of here. No mailbox. I guess the whole not rain, nor sleet, nor snow thing doesn't apply out here. Wait, what about that "posted" sign? It's got to account for something. Maybe we'll run into a neighbor who will tell us that we're as crazy as the old lady did. Maybe we should just go back. What if someone's home? Well, they obviously don't want to be bothered, or they wouldn't live out here. Ah, come on. Oh, God! It's a real fixer-upper. Got it? Looks like nobody's home. Well, let's go meet with James and Jenna then. Hey, Brooke? Yeah? The stuff you said before, about grad school, are you serious about that? Why? I don't know. I was just wondering, that's all. Will, don't be gay. Yeah. Gay! Jesus! Come on, let's go. Actually, can you just give me a quick second? I'm gonna take a quick piss somewhere over there. Okay. Do you want me to come with you? Why, you wanna hold it or something, huh? No! No? Well, then, hang tight, I'll be right back. Okay. Hey! Hey! Brooke? Decided you wanted to hold it? Will? Who the fuck are you, huh? Huh? Ahhh! No! Wait! Please! Wait! Wait! Wait! Ahhh! Will! No! Ahhh! Brooke! Brooke, over here! Jenna, he got Will! Who? Who got Will? I don't know. I don't know. It's some man! He killed him, Jenna, he killed him! He killed him? You saw this? Jenna, we gotta go. We gotta get help. Please! Oh, my! Where's Kyle? Are you okay? My friend. From earlier. Yes, dear. He was here. And? And he left. Where did he go? He went to find some answers, that's what he told me. Now, tell me everything that happened. He came out of nowhere. Who? I don't know. Keep walking. Was it the man from the highway? Was it the man with the knife? I don't know. Jenna! There wasn't anybody at that old house you sent us to. Oh! Of course not. I told you David hadn't lived here in many years. Bullshit! There was nothing I could do, Jenna. Oh, sweetie, don't even think about something like that, okay? We're going to get help and everything is going to be fine, okay? Are you calling me a liar? I'm saying that I don't think you're telling me the truth. Jenna, he got Will. Come on. I thought David didn't have any family? Where did you get that? Where's his daughter? I think you better leave now. Why didn't you tell me you were Damien's mother? Oh, his face! It was awful, Jenna. No, get up. We have to keep going. Boy, you have gone and gotten yourself in a mess of something you'll never get out of. You're in too deep. Best start runnin'. You'll never get out alive. There's no escape. There's no escape. He's gonna be on your scent soon. And when he is, you're gonna be dead. Run! Run! Bye-bye. Bye-bye, nice young man. Please, Jenna! James! Get in the truck. I told y'all to go down Pettigrew. What? What are you talking about? Are you David Randall? Yeah, I'm David Randall. Why didn't you tell me that when we first met? It's complicated. There's so many things that don't make sense around here. They'll all make sense soon enough. Jenna! Hey! Over here! Come on out. Where's my daughter? Is that the last of 'em? Sorry, James. Come on, you son of a bitch! Ahhh! Ahhh! Help! Help me! Please! Help me, please! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help me, please! Jenna. You kids don't worry none. He'll be in here soon. We're never gonna get out alive. Don't say that, I'm gonna get us out of here. Where am I? Who is that? Shh! Just stay quiet. What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm sorry. I had no choice. What's going on? Who are you? Is this your daughter? Yes. And this is your plan to save her? I had to do something! You used me as bait! What are you talking about? David, where are my friends? If they're not here, they're dead. We're never going to get out of here. Damien, we've done nothing to hurt you. Damien. Let us go. You'll never see us again. No! Ahhh! Hey, hey, it's okay. Look out! Ahhh! No! He's lost a lot of blood. Let's get him out of here. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Dad! No! No! Come on. Howdy there! Oh, my! My Lord, child. What happened to you? The man... The man with the face. He killed my friends. Who killed your friends, missy? The pig. Pig head. Where are my other friends? Oh, I haven't seen your friends, dearie. We've been slow since I saw you last. Oh, my, I'll get you a glass of water. Here. Who did you say killed your friends? Big pig head. We don't have a moment to lose. You go stand by my car. I'll get my keys and I'll take you to the doctor's house,
