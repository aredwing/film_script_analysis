When you live in the dark, it's much easier to die. You barely lose anything. Darkness replaces darkness. And we deserve to live in the dark. - Why, Grandpa? - Because. What other nation curses the sun like we do? We curse the bright sun, the bloody sun... It's a miracle it shines on us at all. Besides the sun, we curse God, bread, mother... What can a nation that curses sun, God, bread and mother hope for? Bloody sun! I taught you to read and write, and to count pigs. But it's all useless in this country. I'll teach you something that will be of some real use. Get away from me, jinx! Fucking raven! Bad luck. Can't you play something cheerful? Yes sir, Sergeant sir. Fucking funeral music. Stop playing and I'll let you sniff my girlfriend's letter. Serbian Army - Scout Unit The Turks are moving their artillery. - Second Lieutenant, sir! - I could hardly find you, scouts! Now we get all the food for the past week! - We must inform HQ. - After breakfast, neighbour. It's a direct order, Sergeant. Yes sir, neighbour sir. - I forgot what a pig looks like. - A pig? A pig looks like a goose, only without feathers. Who took the other leg? I want it back. I'm asking you nicely. Before you call Turks for help. Come on, let's have it. - Gentlemen... - He looks like a spy to me. - My name is Leonardo Spasic... - Shut up! He's got some kind of machine gun! Let me waste him! You can commit cold-blooded murder, gentlemen. But then you won't appear on the front page of the Serbian News as the brave liberators of Old Serbia! Gentlemen. Smile please. ST GEORGE SHOOTS THE DRAGON Gavrilo! Look! Who'd think a city girl could make this on her own? - What's wrong? - Save it for my grave. I don't need it now. - We'll manage... - Let go! - You will manage. - Gavrilo! GiVe it to George! He came back in one piece. It'll look better on him. Don't worry, he'll be back. He loves you. I'm sorry. I thought... You're an expert on love? No one came for you? No. Welcome home. Two years later Quiet down! Zoja-man, angry! Zoja-dog, mean! Watch your dog, Vane! Bite merchandise! Gavrilo, take me with you, please. Grandpa told me reading and writing is useless. Take me with you, just this once. Why not, Gavrilo? It's an honest living. What's the problem? Honest... Yes, it is. You. Run off home. They just can't get enough. Bloody Vukovic brothers. Almost every night. Sergeant! We can get them on their way back! Let them go this time. The cattle will die without salt. Besides, what would you do for tobacco? - Am I getting grey? - Not at all, Sergeant. Don't lie to me. I still can't say nothing to you. And I'd thought it all through. Stupid woman! I can't... I'm not a city girl. Mile will take me home. - What home? - My home. To my family. Oh my God! I'm so ashamed! Kid, how come you missed some of us? If we're not equal here, I'm changing establishments. Damn right! We natural unnaturals were the best customers before the wars! And then we unnaturals with medals took over. Him first... Serious wounds have priority. Since when does that apply here? Don't bother serving me, I'm sick of this. Call me when you've decided! Until then, no drinks! That's my teaching! Right in the face, every time. - Just like Marx said. - Fuck Marx and fuck you! Poisoning the kid's mind with that foreign bullshit! What's the use of school? All he needs to know is to count pigs. He'll make a decent living from smuggling. - Profiteers! - Drop the politics, brothers! Look at him. What are you doing, Zoja? When will you get rid of that whorehouse monstrosity? Spasic's wife ordered it, but he won't have it in the house. The mars right. MoVe it! Like we're for the mirror. Better not look at it at all. Gendarmes. Three of them. I finished it yesterday. Who is it? Me, George. That's me. You wouldn't know, of course. You prefer me in the dark. Cover yourself. People will talk. Do I look better in the painting or like this? I have to go. Sergeant, sir! We have to hurry, sir. - Trouble at the Normal Tavern! - Baco's beating his wife to death! Gendarmes don't deal with domestic matters. Deal with this one! They treat women like cattle! Right? Wort let a decent man get drunk? - Hit me, I don't know a better life! - You don't, and you won't! Don't you moVe! Can you at least let us finish this in peace? You're not gonna fuck with me! - You're not a fucking gendarme, cow! - I am, and I can jail your ass! I'd rather rot than let her humiliate me, like some women... He's just drunken fool, George. Sit down, have a drink. Go home, you'll get over it. Shoo... shoo! Get away! These beasts need a strong hand! Madame Katarina, can you eat these? No. But they're beautiful. And they smell nice. Would you like to smell? Come. Does this mean we shoot at our neighbours? You heard the major. Shoot on sight. - Yes, sir! - Wait. Tell the smugglers to stop crossing. Good evening. I'm not armed. Can I go with you, sir? Ask my brother. He's selling tickets. Get in! Don't be afraid, scholar! Give me a hand with the other passengers! Or, if you've got half a dinar... - I have! - Pay on the other side. You scholars are a law-abiding lot. Hop in! - What's up, Zoja? - He's a jinx! Just when everything's going so great, too! Isn't it so, bro? Jinx! Tomorrow, to school! Go ahead, feed them! Sava River - Border between Serbia and Austria-Hungary I pray to you, St George, to shoot the German ship. Zoja, it's okay. Keep Gavrilo safe, and our boat, my buddies the pigs... the jinx too! They've gone. What's wrong, scholar? Shit your pants? Pigs are the only beasts who don't know the stars exist. It's their necks... they can't look up to the sky. They can only look down, at the mud. Pigs still happy. Mud's all they see, their whole lives. - They must miss the stars. - Stars! Any pictures in that book, jinx? They're late. This doesn't smell good. - Well, I'm off. - Quiet! You'll go when I tell you. Zoja, sing. Let's go. Wait. Gavrilo, this time, no credit. You're always first here. - Like you're Austrian, not us. - Did you bring everything? Everything. Direct from Vienna. Quick! Unload! Wait! - You cut it, right? - No way! Cross my heart! Best salt in the Empire! - Certified. No double-cross. - Check it out. Not bad. - How could it be bad? - We'll take it. Look at the mirror. Fit for an emperor! Careful! Break it and you die! For you. What's with this art stuff, Gavrilo? - Hope it's not yours. - Cut the crap. Gavrilo, hurry up. This is no fucking trade! Venerable Serbs and Gypsies... I'm delighted to see the cooperation between our two countries is going smoothly... despite the overwhelming cultural differences. - Pay your countryman. - Afraid it's your turn. We're at loss, again. You Serbs are getting flash... Almost like Gypsies! Welcome to our country. We wish you a pleasant stay. St George, shoot them, too. See you around, Gavrilo. - Take it! - If I may, now... Go! Come back when you graduate. - Serbia needs scholars. - And books with pictures! Jinx! What's your name? Princip. Gavrilo Princip. Take care, namesake. There goes your namesake, without paying! I'll take care of that. Don't! Zoja-man pay for him. My treat. Good luck, jinx. Gavrilo, what's that? Who ordered this? - Zoja, what's in the box? - Not for Zoja-man. Dead. I knew it. Jinx! Frogs. Silent. Gavrilo... Is this that cinema you were talking about? Doesrt look good. Small mirror... small jinx. Big mirror... Archduke Franz Ferdinand visits Sarajevo I'm sorry... Excuse me... Sorry, could you please... Daddy, look! Why don't you use a rod, like a normal person? This is modern fishing... American-style! Vane! Orphan! Don't let our lunch get away! Look at that ungrateful little prick! If you don't like this work, we can send you back where we found you! Begging in the street! What's wrong with you? Doesrt warm your heart to see the boy play? No. - Another trairs overturned. - It's upside down, drunkard! Pass it oVer. Zoja! If you grow into a dragon, I'll have to kill you. But if you stay a frog, we'll be friends. Orphan! Vane! The whole village is weeping Only my Smilja's sleeping Let her sleep Let her sleep I'll show you, you crippled fucker! Of all the houses, you want to fiddle in front of mine? Let the cripple sing if he can't play. - Come to the Normal Tavern. - Thanks, I'm in a hurry... - Got some business. - I won't beat you, like the others. I'll scorch you like a pig! Crippled punk! Come in here, to the Normal Tavern! You sang in front of his house. No! Maybe I was humming... to myself. - I sing all day long... - Don't you sober me up! I can walk by any house, singing, humming... If I ever catch you singing around my house... the next song will be at your funeral, you reject fuck! Good morning, madam. Two of you against a man on crutches? - Are you all right? - Madam... I saw you, and it was like an angel looked at me. He was... singing outside my house, to my wife. Such faith in the power of music. How touching! If a cow dies, they say I stole it and put it in a painting. They think I've cursed the village. Do you think so too? Before I met you... I had both arms. A boy who didn't know what to do with them in my company... If there was a medal for smuggling, each of your peasants would've got one! Invalids, sir. Some have medals from the war. Real ones. Nice for people who like to parade their ornaments. This time we'll melt everything into bombshells. There'll be no iron left for such trifles. Glory awaits us, Sergeant. Yes, sir. That fine lady will be the death of him. Mark my words. Spit in my mouth when you're the sickest. Gavrilo... happy! - Zoja-man happy too. - Get out of here! I can't work with this shit. So? When is your wife's baby due? In a month, God willing. Nice. So you'll have two babies this year. Let's drink to that. Let's drink to that. You're too late, gendarme! You're too late, gendarme! Now what? Nothing. We've done all we can. - Does the gendarme know? - My husband's my business. - Does the gendarme know? - My husband's my business. Leave my business to me, like you always did. I'm going back to Belgrade next week. To my family. You'd leave your husband and home? What husband? What home? What husband? What home? Why do you think I came to this pit of misery? - Wait a minute. - I'm waiting. Now what? Will you tell your wife? No. You won't. Now hear me out. When you were a cadet in Belgrade, you were in my house every day. When you were a cadet in Belgrade, you were in my house every day. You asked me not to go and study art in Paris! I drove you almost to the front line in my father's car! - You begged me to wait for you! - And? And what came back? What? What came back? Answer me! Is this the Gavrilo you waited for? Is this the Gavrilo you waited for? Who can I take care of like this? Your wife. She's not like you. She does everything, like a man. She lost her husband there. Where I lost my arm. I'm going. What will you do now? The Gavrilo I waited for would ask what will we do. Katarina! Looks like someone beat him to it and got his missus to safety. - Your orders, sir? - You're dismissed. Wort you ask me where I've been? No, just whether you know where you are now. No, just whether you know where you are now. In my wife's room. You forgot to whip me, mister Gendarme. I... I never loved you. And I could never love you. - I am... - I know. I know everything. We won't make it before dawn. - My brother is crazy. - Mile! You know love... LoVe is nice, I saw it! You know love... LoVe is nice, I saw it! If you werert my brother, I'd smack you with the oar! Hit Zoja-man. Then you feel better! I didn't do it, I swear! I didn't do it, I swear! Where's your grandson, old man? I don't know. And if I did, you know I wouldn't tell you. - So it's all the same to you. - Tell him I'm looking for him. - So it's all the same to you. - Tell him I'm looking for him. With a gun? Who went across? The regular crew. Katarina? What would she be doing with them? Don't play games with this! We shoot at anybody on the river, so do they! I understand why you shoot, but why them? You haven't heard? A student assassinated Ferdinand. Fucking Krauts! They'll slaughter my children! GaVro! Let's drink to the end of an empire! Mile! Gavrilo! St George, please protect my children. It's tragic when a grown man loses his mind. At least when I screwed around, I did it with style. You know love. LoVe Very nice, I saw! What, Zoja? Gendarme... not happy. He think she ran away with Gavrilo! Gendarme... not happy. He think she ran away with Gavrilo! - Gavrilo happy! Zoja-man happy. - Yeah, we're all fuckir happy. What on earth have you done? Hit me, brother. Hit me, brother. They killed all... People... horses... The music... all... The music... all... - St George... - Did we pay in advance? Shoot, St George! They killed them all! I knew it! I knew I'd be fucked because of Serbs. I knew I'd be fucked because of Serbs. - Fuck, I paid in advance! - Hush, pigs. There! Don't waste your bullets feeling sorry for them! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I want them alive. Zoja-man dead! - Hold on. - Zoja-man dead! Genuine gendarme bullet. Genuine gendarme bullet. Let me play for you, Zoja. You'll feel better. I won't! Gavrilo! Where's my wife? Why ask me about your wife? - You know where I was tonight. - I do. That's why I'm asking. Then you've nothing to ask. You can simply arrest me for crossing the border. I want to... I want to... To ask you... something no-one in our village has ever asked. Stay away from my wife. Please. I won't ask again, I'll just kill you. I swear to St George. We Vukovics have pillaged armies, cities, empires! But other mers wives? Never! Let him kill you. He'll be doing all of us a favour. You, me and that poor wife of yours. In normal countries, disabled veterans are role models for the young. In normal countries, disabled veterans are role models for the young. But here, they smuggle, beg, booze! In normal countries these freaks don't jump on women. In normal countries these freaks don't jump on women. It's not their fault they got crippled in two wars. And what, it's my fault? I went to war twice in two years, too. I should suffer 'cos I didn't return a horny cripple? - Why so much, George? - For the window. Every single day I think of your kindness. And of the baby. The war saved me from going insane. I prayed to St George for death in battle... for rest. Instead of death, he sent me... her. Instead of death... Instead of death... ForgiVe me. Had the Archduke survived, he would have inerited the following titles: Emperor of Austria! King of Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina! King of Rama, Cumania, Iliria... Duke of Dubrovnik and Zadar! Master of Kotor... Hundreds and hundreds of titles as ruler over enslaved nations! What a tyrant he would have been, had he lived! Madam Slavka! Madam Slavka! Nine long months without war. The kids are itching for it. Madam Slavka! Go ahead, talk. May I speak with my wife in priVate? In priVate? Is this a police station where you can interrogate people without witnesses? It's okay, Auntie. If your talk is unfit for my ears, it's unfit for my house, too. Is that clear? If it is, then go ahead, talk. Never mind me. Let's go home. Please. What for? This morning I resigned. I handed in my uniform. I left you alone... For days... Life was better when I lived as a carpenter. I've been thinking... We could sell up. Move to the city. Village life isn't for you. Is the city for you? Please, stop that. It gets on my nerVes. You've read those novels. I'm not saying... It exists... maybe with younger folks. For a time. Then it goes away. What goes away? LoVe? And what's left, when 'it' all passes? Worries. Nothing else? Just worries? Nothing else. Just worries. And you call that life? Madam Katarina, there's a boy here. He says he knows you. Katarina... This one probably isn't the type of man you deserve. But he's certainly better than the one you're crying over. Auntie... When did a woman ever love a man for his virtues? I haven't told you everything. I'm pregnant. I love you... Auntie, may I ask you to come with us? For a couple of days. I'll wait for you downstairs. In Blumbach, in just one day, Ferdinand shot 53 goats! On his hunting trips, he killed over 6,000 deer! Even if he'd done nothing else, he deserved to be killed! My child, my late husband was right. One should only see peasants at the market, as briefly as possible. Spare a coin for a war hero! You're a reactionary element! There's no place for you here! Dear Prime Minister Pasic... This is a request for urgent help for disabled veterans! We wanted to appeal immediately after the war against the Turks! But the war against the Bulgarians was approaching, therefore... War. Zoja- Shut up, Zoja, this is for grownups. Now the war against Austria-Hungary is here. But, Mr. President Pasic, I ask for your sympathy... We have to catch our breath between wars! Micun, this letter is... forgive me... pure cocksucking! We meet in secret, like conspirators, for what? For this? A demand must begin with the words: Shame on you! When war breaks out, Serbia wins, but the people lose! The result of each war is less people, but more government! Shame on you! That same government won two wars in two years! It expanded Serbian territory by one quarter! The government didn't, we did! We won the wars! Let the last man standing write the demand. Now we're rejects! Who was rejected from the government? No one! I don't give a fuck for a quarter of Greater Serbia, - I've lost a quarter of my body! - Belotic, you traitor! You blind bastard! Serve the gendarme. I've resigned. Feel free to speak against the government. I don't know, George. You'll forget yourself and report us out of habit. - Well said! - I'm spying on you? I'm the informer? Okay... Your informant letters, addressed to me personally. We have a spy in this tavern. There... read. Something for everyone. I won't do it. Dear Mister George... My conscience demands I inform you that two nights ago, I was sitting in the Invalid Tavern, speaking such... fil... filth... that I should have... I should be shot. And I did all this just to make them talk. Because they were only talking about other mers wives... Who laid who, where, how, when, and how many times. Around midnight, I got them to blab. Then they blabbed until dawn. Whoever wrote this, I hope his hand shrivels up. Particularly vocal against the government... was that ugly pig Vojo. I can't write that well. But I know someone who can. Quiet! Let's hear the rest. I'll rip someone's head off! Gendarmes from other villages envied me. Their folk wouldn't talk even after a beating. I served the police for money. You do it for the love of it. Go ahead now, speak about politics. There is an "M"... Like "Zoja... Man". This guy obviously doesn't know how ugly the priest's wife is. Are there any pictures? George! From Grandpa Aleksa, and all of us. For your honest service to our village. - How's this bay of mine behaving? - He's okay. Aleksa told me you made it for your son. Sorry. He'd be just like you. This tall. Thanks for the watch. It's exactly two hours slow. You get used to it. It goes like this: Let her sleep Let her sleep Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets! In the right corner, Djukic, a true Serbian hero! In the left... Katarina. Place your bets, have some fun and help the invalids! Thank you. George! Let's go. It's too hot. The two of you go. I've got something to do. George! How's your watch? Both fighters possess the courage of our hero, Gavrilo Princip! Your hand guided me when I saved his life. Help me now, to save it again. Don't let me kill him. Spare a coin for a war veteran, good people! St George really is your patron. There! A man! Waving! Hey, Kraut! Come have a beer! WaVing, my ass! He's threatening us! Man! Flying! On a dragon! I say... that's a threat. No you don't! He's really threatening us. Bastard! - I'll fuck him up! - Threaten us... Luka, are you celebrating or shooting each other? Teacher, this is military business. Gavrilo! Have a shot on me! Get down! Get down, you fucking Kraut! Now we're fucked! They're really gonna get mad! People! We killed the plane! - You're alive! - We're both alive. By the decision of the Serbian Supreme Command, and signed by General Radomir Putnik personally, we hereby declare a full-scale mobilization! The third bells in three years. I'm afraid there won't be anyone left to hear the fourth one. Let my great-grandson hear. We don't have to. Don't worry, Grandpa. Our mother was in labour for two days with Gavrilo. God forgive me, sometimes I wish he'd never been born at all. Come on, people, last orders. The tavern will close during the war. It wouldn't be right. Does this mean I can't sing? Once it starts, it'll soon be over soon. They called me again, a half-blind man! And again, they didn't call me. - What happened? - Jelena's okay. She'll be fine. And the baby? What about the baby? After the war, your business will boom, cripples, like never before! I wanna make a reservation In Invalid tavern right now! The Kraut can run and hop But at the Sava's banks he'll stop MILAN VUKOVIC Now you stink too. Just like the rest of us. Major, sir! Gavrilo Vukovic, second lieutenant, cavalry. One thing I hate more than Germans. Doctors. - Let's hear it. - I'm reporting for duty. I know the river, I've crossed it a hundred times. A smuggler? Decorated. Before taking up smuggling, you were a soldier. You know I don't make the rules. If it was down to me, I'd take you. We need even men like you. I'm sorry. Our brave student killed him His name is Princip Gavrilo You're going to die, and you scream like hell! Spare a coin for a war veteran, good people! Grandpa, don't do this. You promised to take me to Belgrade. Everything will be all right, Gavrilo can tell you. Grandpa. I know you can hear me. This is horrible. - He lay down and decided to die. - Please, just one smile, grandpa. Dying isn't going so smoothly... Mile, put me down, I want to be closer to the ground. Grandpa! That's better. Grandpa... You lived your way, and you died your way. A successful man. Gavrilo! Slavka, if the war starts to go badly for us... Burn the house down, I don't want Krauts in it. Look out for yourself, George. I'm an expert in war. If I don't make it back, everything I have is hers. And the child she's expecting... If it's a boy, let him stay here, to keep the family name alive. If it's a girl, get her out of this misery, as far away as possible. Since my husband died, I've not met as good a man as you. It's easy to be good when you've got nothing else left. Goodbye, Slavka. There's something for you in the shed. - You told him whose child it is? - He already knew. May St George be with you! Watch your head, gendarme! - Thrash them just like I would. - Stop it! I'm tired, already. Give me that. What's the hurry, George? The Krauts will wait for us! St George... Please love Aleksa. Love Gavrilo... Mile... Love them like Zoja-man does. Here, two dinars. The bill I never paid. Mile... Get some rest. I'll take over. Soldiers. I'm afraid we'll envy Aleksa soon enough. We'll say: "Lucky you, Aleksa". My grandpa used to say "I'd rather die than that something happen to me!" Shows their true colours, beating a man who brings them a soldier's letter! Only the filthy Babic family could do that. No bird's flown over their house for 200 years. So you called in at Vojo's wife? I took her a letter from Vojo! - A letter from the frontline is sacred! - Count yourself lucky. You wouldn't have got out of my yard... Alive. You're crippled, not deaf! You heard me, frontline letters! Fuck off! Rajko, drop by my place sometime. Bring a letter to my wife. I already did. A pregnant woman doesn't go to a wake. - Bad luck. - Exactly. Let her in. I don't want to find you here when I come back. Neither you nor her. - Witch! - Let's get out of here. Will St George finally kill the dragon and save us from evil? St George, help us! Witch! Why did you come? I'm leaving tomorrow. We won't see each other again. Zoja-man sad. While Europe has danced, sung and grown rich we'Ve spent centuries in the trenches! At their border posts, like their guard dogs! Where's that fucking Europe now? Cer Mountain, The first battle of the Great War Serbia today has four million people. Austria-Hungary has 55 million! For years they've been threatening and talking bullshit! They say that Serbia should 'bathe in iror! I've never heard a wickeder threat than to bathe a nation in iron! We'll stick their iron up their asses! They'll feel it for many years! If they cross the border and head for our villages, we fuck their what? - We fuck their mothers! - Exactly! I have the honor to inform you that we are at the focus of the enemy attack! Once we repel the attack, we will chase them all the way back to Vienna! All the way to Vienna, we will... Fly over, Sir! The baby is mine, and only mine. The decision is mine. 'Keep the family name going'! That important name... They go to war, sire children, and die in that name! We have to give birth and rejoice if the child goes to war! If it's a boy... This child will not go to war. Gavrilo! Gone mad! Broke into army barracks! Took dynamite... to kill boat! To kill Gavrilo-man. Mad. Wanna all by him-self. What? You want to kill yourself? I came to see what sort of man you are, one last time. Kill yourself? What amazing knowledge, bravery and wisdom that takes! - What do you want from me? - That you stay alive. Katarina, it's wartime. Is nothing holy to you men apart from war? Nothing? To be fathers, to love! You forgot to learn that! I spit on your holy things! Do you hear me?! Not easy without a man in the house, right? Need a hand with anything? How can you help me? Well, I can't chase chickens around the yard. But... I have my uses. Really? Tie up the dog, girl. Men! Well done! Bravo! We never got this far before! Next time, we break their lines! I promise you that! Sergeant! Dismiss the men. - Fall out. - George. Why haven't you told him about the rejects? When? If some cripple had jumped the Captairs wife he'd have us all running there! Look at this letter! Running? We'd be fucking flying! They fuck women and steal chickens? Did you hear me? Men unfit for war fuck women and steal chickens? Sir, we have the same reports from other units. - I had to report this to you. - And I must report it to the Major, The Major to the Colonel, the Colonel to the General, The General reports this to Supreme Command, so They react instantly, They throw away all the war plans and order the men home, so They dig in trenches outside their houses, wait, and kill the studs! Get away! Piss off! Sergeant, are you married? Yes I am, Captain. Any children? No... not any more. God willing, I'll have them again. Do you too suspect that someone's invading your home and your wife? No, not at all, sir. While I'm away... there's another man... - Another man? - He takes care of my wife and home. If it wasrt for him, I'd be worried. Get out. What's this nonsense? What bloody man? - Her man. - Your wife's man? - Yes. - She's your lawful wedded wife? Yes, she is. It's an ugly story, this isn't the time. Excuse me. Wait a minute! Why isn't that scoundrel here? He lost an arm in the last war. We fought together. We all fought together, Sergeant. Do you care about your wife at all? I came here to die... just like you. I came here to win! But the soldiers try to stay alive. I feel sorry for them. For me, this is a relief. From a greater evil, I came into a lesser one. What? I'm sure you heard everything! Fuck diplomacy. Who's coming with me? Wait, Baca. We have a petition. If they catch you, you'll be court-martialled. I'm going hunting for a songbird. Let's start signing. I won't. Yes, you will. - I can't write! - Just put a cross! Not that big cross, moron! GiVe it to me. Next! Mikan, watch out for the gendarme. Why hasn't the Captain taken this to the Supreme Command? The Supreme Command has better things to do! They don't deal with rejects and lovers! - This isn't about soldiers! - Who is it about, if not us? We get letters saying that rejects are prowling around our houses! - I didn't dare open the last letter! - Enough! Enough talk! I did what I could. - Listen up! - Maybe a package from my mother. Letters for the 3rd Company! Somebody's finally remembered you, footsloggers! Let's see what treats we have here! Vojo Milovanovic! Vojo, stop fucking around! - Milovanovic! - I'm dead. - Milovanovic! - Dead! Mikan Babic! - Mikan Babic! - May God rest his soul. Baca DragojeVic! They're all dead! These men are replacements. You're alive, but you're no good to me. - Baco. - Baco! - Did you at least kill them? - Caught me before I got there. Too bad. Sergeant, assemble the squad. Captain, is there any way we can avoid this? - People, don't... - George... You always respected the country, but my house, never! I believed you when you said that the country exists! That the country's won'th dying for! All I knew of this country was my family and my home! - Fuck you and the country! - Ready. Aim. Soldier, I wish you lasting rest. Fuck you and fuck the country! Fire! Brother! My brother! War... Boom, boom! Mile, why don't you open the tavern? Expect from us to drink river water till the end of the war? Look! - I'm getting out of here! - They know us... We're a civilian building, they won't shoot at us! Our Russian brothers and Allies will never abandon Serbia! Please, don't. We are invincible! Kraut murderers! I suggest we don't relax until the Allies come. - Pass it on. - Aleksa. You died right on time. Fucking cripple! Over here! - Mile, what's this? - There you are! - By the order of the Command... - They granted our pensions? - I don't think so, teacher. - Now you're fucked! If you're able enough to fuck other mers wives, you're able enough to fuck Krauts at the front! Zoja-man don't want to shoot. So you can fuck now, in the name of the king and the country! - I'm for the military band! - Is this the enemy or the allies? - I am straight! - I can see! On the road! What's all this? What on earth are you doing? Where's your brother? With that whore again? - He seized the opportunity! - Shut up! - Let's go! - MoVe! I can go by myself! Please, don't! I've got a mill to run! - MoVe it! - Faster! Come on, child. Stop! - Please... - Where are you going? Once this is over, I'll come to Belgrade. I promise. Over? You're waiting for the end of something that has no end. I'm not going to let some war make my decisions for me. Come on! Move it, you bastards! - Zoja-man won't shoot. - Yes you will! Move! - Move, you old fart! - Faster! Faster, rejects! Witch! Witch! MoVe! MoVe! The mobilization doesn't apply to you. You're a decorated war hero. If it was up to me, you'd be leading this pack of freaks! As fucker-in-chief! Move these beasts! Let's go. Gavrilo! Where you go, I go too! You're not going anywhere. Do you hear? I'm coming, Gavrilo! Please! - You won't stop me! - Go home! Go! I'm coming, and that's it! Go home! I hope you drop dead, Gavrilo! Drop dead! Drop dead! Do you hear me, Gavrilo?! Drop dead! When you're out of ammo, and the enemy is still advancing... Use the bayonet! When the bayonet breaks, use your hands! When they break your hands, use your teeth! When they shoot you down, fall right across their path! Let them trip over you! Fuck them even when you're dead! Serve the Fatherland even in death! Is that clear? Can you hear me, sir? Major, sir! Requesting permission for another charge! Can you hear me? Yes! Another charge! We've got enough men! We don't need reinforcements! Please, Major, sir! I'm begging you! I'm down on my knees! Yes, sir! - Motherfucker! - I wish I was dead. We're out of luck! The orders are to wait for the night and reinforcements! It's a real shame, sir. However... for the first time in my life... I will have to disobey my superior. He's a goner. Thank you, St George. What a hero, what a madman he was! I raise you ten. I call... When his sort are all dead, we'll become the heroes without noticing it! Show your cards. May God rest his soul. Rest in peace. What do you think you're doing, bastard? No, you don't! Let him take it. The hero doesn't need it anymore. Thank you, Major, sir. - Reinforcments are on their way. - We're saved. Reinforcements will be here. Fresh troops are coming. Fresh troops! Just one more battle, and God willing, we'll all go home... alive! - Vojo, fresh troops. - Thank you, St George! Heroes! It's almost free! I can make you immortal! - Come on, let's take a picture. - For yor grand and grand grand children! - Heroes, come on! - Get out of here! I will immortalize you! Clear off, jinx! - I want to take a picture. - Me, too! Make sure we look like heroes! George, let's have one souvenir photo. Move closer. Closer... All together. Move closer. Closer... All together. I like it! Excellent... Real conquerors. Not one smile, you'll spoil everything! Look over here! And... Watch the birdie! What are you staring at? Heroes! MoVe it! - Let's go! Faster! - MoVe! MoVe! Come on! Faster! The petition. It worked! Everybody signed it, George. We didn't ask you because... Fuck. Fall in! What kind of people are you? Sergeant, sir! - You, stand at attention. - How? To avoid revolt, they have been sent here as a punishment! Punishment?! They told us that being here was an honour. Sign here. What a fool! I came here fucking singing! - Dane, avenge your brother. - We've been set up, brothers! - Malicious, wagging tongues! - Shoot. Brothers! Those were all lies! - Go ahead, shoot. - We're brothers now? Where are our wives and sisters, brothers? Enough! I'm sick of your bullshit! You deserve such replacements. This was all your idea, you sad excuse for a man. You pushed the soldiers to revolt. You ordered the mobilization of these poor creatures. You lacked the guts to come and kill me, like a man. Gavrilo, shut your mouth. Once again, gendarme, you fucked up! I wasrt mobilized, I'm a war reject. I came here of my own will. Have you done this because of her? Don't you mention her. Don't moVe! I told you. A witch! We could've settled this between the two of us. Sergeant, sir, the enemy is preparing to attack. It seems we won't settle this in this life. Into position! We don't need their commands. Let's do the job they brought us here for. The replacements are here! Too bad I won't be able to thank you personally! - Sergeant, sir... - Motherfucking sun... Ninko... Ninko! Bro! Finally! The ones that cursed us didn't waste their time. Let's go, brother. Across the lands forever cursed The Sava's mighty banks have burst The whole village is weeping Shit! The last thing I'll hear... Only my Smilja's sleeping George. ForgiVe us. We didn't want it to turn out like this. GaVro! Prepare to attack. Sergeant, sir! We can't! The Major hasn't... What are you doing here? - George! Did you see that? - What? - Songbird! I'll kill you now! - Quiet! Don't come out till it's all over. Understand? Take this watch. It's still slow. Two hours exactly. You'll get used to it by the time you grow up. Vane, goodbye. - Songbird! - The krauts will hear us! He shouts like crazy. A man can't even die in peace. Our time now... to die. Why don't they shoot? Our Czech brothers! Our Croat brothers! Don't shoot! I pray to you, St George. Zoja-man don't want to hurt! Songbird! I've been looking all over for you! So you sing... I sing all day long... I can walk by any house... That's okay. Fucking... fucking... Fucking petition! Vojo. I wrote those letters... I was the informer. But why? Just out of spite. Hold it, let me unscrew this... Let's go, Luka. What are you doing here? Gavrilo... I saw him. I saw him. - Let me, Vane... - Light our way, kid. Grandpa taught me... to walk in the dark. And so it went on troughout the 20th century.
