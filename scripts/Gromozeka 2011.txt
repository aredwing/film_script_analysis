One elephant, two elephants. One elephant, two elephants. Keep going. I'm tired of this. Okay. Tell me about elephants. They have long tails that grow out of their noses. And ears like Cheburashka's. No. They're bigger. And they're blue. There's no such thing as a blue elephant. They're blue when they swim in the ocean. - I'll get going. - Where? To Mom. She's waiting for me. She promised to take me to McDonalds. And buy a Kinder Surprise. How about this? I'll get your mom to come here. Are you lying? I never lie. Me either. If you lie, God will punish you. But I... He is asleep. - How much did you give him? - 75 milligrams, pediatric dose. You should have given him more. Let's start. To the Aviamotornaya Station. Hi. Can you be more specific? I'll show you the way. Oh, it's you Mukhin. - Hired a bunch of kids. - Hey, Petrovich! - Today's my first time. - His first time. - Oh. Where's Butakov? - I don't know. - Did he show up for duty? - No. He was out yesterday too. Family issues. I'll give him some family issues. - He is playing with fire. - Sir, ...can I go, too? Maybe as backup? Let the young guys go. We're hunting a serial killer. Let the boys shoot. The substation is out again. I told you we need backup power. Let's wait. Tolik went to turn it back on. And risk peritonitis? Clamp. You can't see anything. - Mobile is in my pocket. - What? I said my mobile is in my pocket. Shine some light. Are you deaf? Hurry the hell up before we're bathing in blood. Faster. Shine it. Closer. Suture. Drain it. - What the hell? - Your wife is calling. Tell her I'm busy. He's busy. Tell her I'm operating. I'll call her back. She hung up, Eduard Petrovich. Shit. That's enough. What are you guys doing? I'm a person too. This creates dangerous situation. Can't you wait a little? - We're in love. - Your love is about to do me in. Can't you sit still? We can. Do you know how to dilute alcohol? I thought you didn't drink, Eduard Petrovich. I don't. A guy left me some Bailey's. Want it? Bring it. - Don't go with me. I am OK. - Where are you going? I'm going home. Leave me alone. Where do you think you're going? - What the fuck? - I said leave me alone. Why are you touching me? You think it was all for free? - Leave me alone. - Don't push me. - Don't push me. - Fuck off. - You think it was all for free? - Yeah, right. - You think it was all for free? - I'll start yelling. - Shut your mouth up! - Dream about it. - Shut up! I'll kill you! - Weirdo. - Let me go! - I'll show you... - What's up? - You can't treat women that way. Got that? You can't do that. She said she's going home. Do you understand Russian? Bitch. Bitch! Bastard! - Let's finish him and drive his car. - Fuck him. Enough. Let's go home. Does it hurt? My head is splitting. Freeze! And let my friends go this instant! Gromozeka, we have been set free already. I see. I am late. Just imagine that! Oh, I am so unlucky... Four bottles of beer. Chips with bacon. Two bags. And that. - This one? - Yeah. - Ours? - Russia. Fresh stuff. Stomp your feet, stomp your feet. Clap your hands, clap your hands. Turn around, turn around. Turn around. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Soup's on the stove, meat's in the fridge. But leave some for Gosha. But how are you? - What? - Well, how's your mood? What do you mean, Vasya? Nothing. Just asking. How's work? Fine. Kids are kids. We're learning a poem for a play. Learning what? Today I play with toys, Tanks, guns and cannons, ...but when I grow up I will serve my country. Today on the playground I am training for my future. Mom, don't worry about your son. I will grow up to be a real man. Are you mocking me? No. I've got to go. Anna Ivanovna isn't here, so I'm on my own. Let's go! Move it! Today on the playground I am training for my future. Mom, don't worry about your son. I will grow up to be a real man. Listen, you're a doctor. I don't know what kind of a doctor you are. Maybe you're a good doctor or maybe you're a shitty one. But I know for sure that you'll never have children. Why? Because that's what I want. Asleep? You should learn to knock. Oh, it's a cop. A real one. I asked you not to bring home sluts. She's not a slut. She's my woman. Get your woman out of here. We need to talk. Lady's man. Why did you call? I just wanted to see you. It's been a long time. How long? Pretty long. Not since the anniversary of your mom's passing. You looked different then. Dad, I don't have much time. What do you want? Nothing. Just to see you. To talk. So talk. I guess I don't understand you, Gosha. I know you aren't little anymore. I don't need to wipe your nose or help you on the toilet. Pardon the question. Who are you? - Your son. - I knew that. Then why ask? Do you have a job? Yeah. Where? Doing what? Odd jobs. Buying, selling. Buying what? Selling what? Next question. - How's college? - Fine. - Do you get student stipend? - Yeah. - Is it enough or do you have to work? - Depends. It depends... - A lot? - I'm not starving. Sorry. I'm sorry for asking. How's your personal life? Do you have plans to get married? Too early for that. By your age, I'd served in the army and met your mom. We rented a room. 11 square meters. Communal apartment. Then we ran off to Katseveli. That's where you were... I earned my own keep. It wasn't much, but it was mine. I can earn my own keep too. We feed you. Clothe you. We gave you a car. It's old, but it's yours. You live with us. Temporarily. I won't be eating your food anymore. Gosha, ...do you want me to get you a job on the force? As a trainee? I'll talk to the Major. They respect me. I've been there longer than anyone. The pay's good. Plus hazard pay. It's a man's job. Real, honest, useful work. Pig work. For bastards. I made a little extra money. Take it. Thanks... I'm doing okay. - How much? - Enough. - Enough for what? - For everything. Got it. I'm sorry. I'll take it if you want. But you need it more, Dad. I want you to have it. Please. Don't be mad. I've got to run to class. Bye. Come here, have a look and buy it! I'm selling wool socks. Hey man, come have a look! I've got socks of your size. Buy socks and keep warm. I've got a whole bag of socks here! Lady, come have a look. Many socks, comfortable socks. Come here, buy warm socks. Alexandra. Why not? - You don't understand? - No, I don't. - You never been upset before. - I'm upset now. I am sick. - In what sense? - Literally. - You're an asshole. - Sasha! Sasha, wait. Sasha, come on. - Let go of me. - Come on. Enough. - Enough. - Stop. Quiet. I said quiet. Come on. Come on. - I'm just tired. - Of course you are. You can't be here and there. - You know... - You're tired of lying. - Know how much energy lies take? - I know. Come on. Come to me. When? When will you tell your Elena the Fair? I'll tell her today. When? I'll tell her today. Lying again. Always lying. I'm not lying. Honest. I'm not. I'll be damned, but I'll do it. - Yeah? - For casting call. Fyodor, do we need any men? Is he normal? - Are you a homo? - No. He seems normal. - OK, Liza, time to work. - Give me a second. Let me. Thanks. OK, let's do it. - Climb here. Go for it. - Like this? - Why are you laughing? - It's ticklish. - New guy? - Yeah. Glafira. I told you we don't take old guys. How do I know if he's old or not? Are you old? No. Well, maybe... ...for a father-daughter scene. - What kind of scene? - Father-daughter. What the hell? Security! Security! I don't want to lie anymore. I don't want to lie anymore. I don't want to lie. It's a new life. It will be better for both of us. I'm in love with another... I'm in love with another woman, another woman. Yes. I'm in love with another woman. It's true. We're both adults. This is... I'm in love with another woman! Hi... Don't watch me when I'm eating. Fine. I won't. Did something happen, Kaminsky? Nope. I can see it. One of my patients died. Right on the table. You've never let it get to you before. - That's life. - No, it isn't. It's was a boy. With appendicitis. Plain old appendicitis. I had to tell his mother it was peritonitis. Are you seeing someone? What? Who is she? Do I know her? Yes. You do. Who is it? You. Of course. Of course. Inhale. Exhale. We aren't stopping. I am a slow river. I am eternal motion. I am the wonderful... ...Jianxing. Inhale. Exhale. And now... ...we slowly move... ...from right to left. I am a gentle breeze. Jun goon. I release... ...my will... ...and turn into... ...a flowering tree. [Shoe Repair] We're a reliable firm. - Right. How about half upfront? - No. Can you do something... ...to disfigure her that won't hurt? - Who is she to you? - Nobody. Strange. People come to us when they have problems with relatives. But that's none of my business. Do you know... ...if this is going to last a long time? What? Winter. I'm sick of winter. I don't know. It's a big job tonight. A sting. We're hunting a serial killer. So don't wait for me. OK, I won't. Why don't you say... "... take care of yourself, dear"? I could get killed. Fine. Take care of yourself, dear. You don't worry about me at all, do you? Why not? I do. Inside. Deep down. I'm off. Go. Get undressed. Beds come together. Come here. Leave them on. - You look like John Lennon in them. - And you're my Yoko Ono. When is this going to stop? This is the last time I'll ask. When will this stop? I'm tired of hiding in rat holes. How long can I do this? I do respect myself. Stop it. Enough. I'm sick of this. Of this life. - Do you sleep with her? - Who? Your wife. Yeah. In the same bed. - Stop it, Sasha. - Why do I have to stop? Why do you frown and look at your watch every time I mention her? Is she some holy cow whose name should never be mentioned? Then go live with her. Leave me alone. - This is different. - Sure thing. I've had enough. You men are cowards. You can't make decisions. And you call yourself... ...a surgeon. Hey dude. Why are you so glum? Life's shitty. That's why. You guys aren't cracking smiles either. - Hello. - Hello, sir. Gromov, come see me. I've known you a long time, so I'll get to the point. I've got a job cut order. I thought it over. - You are no good for operations. - I had cases solved. - Yeah. You had cases solved. - 19 years ago. - I had an honorary mention. - You did. You can't fire me. I spent my entire life here. Correct. You did. - What should I do? - Nothing. We'll transfer you quietly to the guards department. We've got a good request from the meat factory. After that ... we'll think of something. B... N... Now try. B, N, SH. - M, Y... - That's fine. Your vision is good. Labor won't be a problem. Let's see your referral. Let me see. - Name? - Alexandra Gennadiyevna. - Last name? - Paley. Paley. Interesting name. - Employment? - Hospital Number Two. Surgery. Where does the father work? Same place. Surgery. Position? Head of surgery. Why don't you ask his name? It doesn't matter. Edik never told you about me? What should he have said about you? That we've been dating a long time. That we love each other. That I'm pregnant. We're having a baby. Here. See? I see. Don't you want him to be happy? Don't you? He's not happy with you. How long have you been together? He's turned into a vegetable. You couldn't even give him children. He really wants kids. If only you knew. He'll be a wonderful father. Well... You have to help. It's his last chance. We're smart women. Let's talk. Get out of here. Smart woman. Let's flutter our wings! And fly like butterflies! Well done. Let's fly! Let's fly! - Daddy, take your shoes off. - I am sorry. Azamat, we are not caterpillars. We are butterflies. Let's fly. We're beautiful spring butterflies. Let's fly! Well done! Let's fly! - Hello, Anna Ivanovna. - Hello. - Where's Larisa? - She left. - When? - A bit ago. - But Larisa Igorevna... - Hush, Sonya. Do you think I'm stupid or something? Sonya, Sonya, ...tell me. Tell me, Sonya. Larisa Igorevna... ...didn't leave by herself. A really fancy guy picked her up. In an Jeep. She drove off with him. - How did she leave? - In his awesome car. Get it? I got shot at today. I could have died. I trusted you, but you... You... I got... ...shot at today. I could have died. I trusted you, but you... No. I trusted you, but you. Look at you! No. Wait. I got shot at today. I could have died. - Why didn't you open the door? - I was in the bathroom. Vasya... Why aren't you at work? - They let me go early. - I got out early too. Vasya, what's wrong with you? - What were you doing in here? - Taking a shower. Why? - It's dry. - What? Well, look in the sink. - I was washing my makeup off. - What makeup? In the kindergarten? Gromov! Are you nuts? I must be wrong. I've wanted to tell you. We should part ways. We should part ways. I respect you. Living with me was an act of heroism. You're great. I have to change my life before it's too late. I have to be honest with myself. I don't want to lie anymore. I don't want to lie... I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. Lena. Lena. Lena. Thanks. Excuse me, do you know what time it is? Everything OK? I won't do it. What? That's against the rules. I know her. I don't work with people I know. - Are you sure? - Yes. One more thing. If anyone else takes the job... ...they'll have war. Hey. You're new here. We can't do the job. For technical reasons. And another thing. If you take this job to another firm, ...you'll have war. - What war? - Holy war. I see. Did your Elena the Fair leave you? Yeah. How did you know? I know. I told her everything. - What did you tell her? - Everything. That we're together. That you love me. That you're happy with me. - Idiot. - You couldn't do it, so I did. You need me. I'll take care of you. - You're like a little boy... - I'm not little. - We'll have a long happy life. - Leave me alone. And I have some news for you. Here's a test. Give me a quick diagnosis. Like they taught you. Nothing special. Here's a tumor. Late stage. Inoperable. Why? - How long does the patient have? - I can't give you a date. Not long. Is he in our ward? - Yeah. - New one? - Yeah. - Send him to oncology. To have it off your conscience. You were always a good student. At least you will live a long happy life. Did you say you have news? We... ...got a new coagulator. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you, Larisa. - Baby. - I want to sleep. Stop it. Larisa, baby. Gromov, I'm telling you plain and clear. I don't want to. I'm tired. I'm sleeping. Is that clear? - Were you up all night? - I said cut it out! Look, how beautiful this world is! How beautiful this world is! Look! How beautiful this world is! You can't happen not to notice That nightingales live in this world... And common pigeons. How beautiful this world is! - Can you see the bottom row? - No. I can't. - How about now? - No. - And now? Can you see the upper letter? Nope. Can you see anything? - No. I'm blind. - Fine. When did you lose your sight? I've been blind my whole life. I couldn't see you. I asked you not to come here to see me. Please tell me something. I've got nothing to say to you. Say what you think. Not the things I want to hear. It was low. Especially about the baby. If you hadn't made me get an abortion that time, ...we would have children today. And another thing. I can't live with you any more. That's it. I said it. Lena, it's complicated. - It's simple. - No, it isn't. - It is. - No, it's not. She did this on her own. Now you'll say that women decide everything. Women decide everything. Kaminsky. There is no love. There's a test for love. And you failed it. I'm going to die soon. Go ahead. I won't feel sorry for you. Today it's been snowing all day... Snow is flying and dancing... Drive straight. Such a big snowfall, Such a big snowfall, These parts have not seen for a long time... But the snow didn't know that And kept falling... Everything around was beautiful. Beautiful and pure. Snow is flying and dancing... If you let a man fuck you, you're a slut. If you don't, you're a bitch. What do we do? - What? - Nothing, you fucking genius! I'm sick of all of you. Clients talk my ear off, cab drivers talk my ear off. You can't just get a ride somewhere. Everyone wants to know your story. I'm sick of you bastards. I didn't say anything. So what? You didn't say anything! My ears are falling off of your not saying anything. Comrade policeman! Wait! - Comrade policeman. - Are you talking to me? Yes. A man is getting beaten. - Where? - In the backyard, by the car park. They may kill him. Let's go. Let's go! Nothing scares them. Freeze! Freeze! Fuck off! - What did you say? - Get out of here, if you want to stay alive. I'm gonna... Are you going to shoot? So what?

What do you want? Can you feel sorry for me? How's that? - Like a mother. - Sure. Hey, it's no big deal. Don't give it another thought. I don't get you men. Really. So you can't get it up. Who cares? Most women would rather have it that way. You come home after work tired. From the supermarket. You're exhausted. You just want to be left alone to sleep. But your man always wants something. And you're exhausted. Talking's better, isn't it? See! And you were whining. Silly. A man like you is a gift from God. It's okay, sweetie. It isn't fatal, okay? [Zoya Petrovna Mozerova] Zoya, I know you see everything. I just don't understand. Why? Why... Zoya? Can you tell me why? Why? Why, Zoya? Why is our daughter a slut? A depression brings storms and wind to the Far East. Kamchatka will also get this weather. No strong winds in Yakutia, ...but very cold, -40 in the afternoon and -50 in the morning. Verkhoyansk will also be very cold. "I am peace," death told itself. I see. Where's the administrator? I'm the administrator. Right. - Want me to show you the way? - I am fine. Fine. Can you show me this one? That's a law enforcement knife. - So? - Do you have a license? No. Do you have anything like that for amateurs? What do you want it for? Fish or game? For cutting up meat ... try this little number. I need it for fish. I've got a good fish knife. The bottom blade slices. The top blade chops. Does a fish in no time. It's double-edged. Not a nick in it. Use the handle to knock out your prey. It will do the job. Blood will wash off well. Fish have blood? Also gills, a bladder and a brain too. I'll take it. - What can you say about this? - About what? Where is the leg? - It was here yesterday. - But it's not here today. Yes. - Did it run away or what? - I don't know. It was here yesterday. - I heard that already. Stop it! - It was here yesterday. Please don't yell at me.

And Lena agreed to go along with it? Yes. I don't have much room. You have a wife. An apartment. Somebody else needs that cot more. Can I use my influence at least once in my life? I won't cause any trouble. I will buy a coffin and I'll buy a plot. Strange. How long do you have? A month. More or less. - Odds? - Zero.

Give me some Phenobarbital. Can't sleep? Yes. Do you carry hydrochloric acid? Spirits. Ammonia spirits. I'm driving. Hi. Hi. Why are you calling? - I miss you. - I see... Why don't you say anything? Why don't you say anything? Are you alone? - Are you at it again? - Sorry. When will you be back home? In the morning? Why? Just curious. In the morning. I'm on night duty. Good. What's good? - Don't pick on words. - Sorry. Well, bye. - Bye. - Bye bye. [Be back in 15 minutes. ] Yes? Hey man, - ... got any booze? - No. Fair enough. Hey, ... need a priest? What? Want last rights? I know a priest. Cheap. I'm not baptized. - Are you a Jew? - Yeah, yeah. I can get a rabbi. He's more expensive because he doesn't drink. I don't need one. Cosmopolitan? No. Agnostic. Agnostic. Listen, agnostic, ...you really ought to believe in God. - Does he believe in me? - Sure. He believes in everyone. You putting it off. But if you wait too long, it will be too late. Get out of here. I'm sick of it all. Who do you think you are? Archangel Michael? - How did you know? - Know what? My name. OK, I get it. I came here to die quietly, but it isn't working. Listen, Archangel Michael. Get going. Where do I go? To hell. You go there yourself! She didn't give you a key? Captain Gromov. Let's see some ID.

Sugar? Lemon. Lemon... Stop right where you are! To hell with you. Shoot me. Where... did you come from? Katseveli. I waited tables in a restaurant. That's where I met her. I remember you. I don't remember you. I love her. I've loved her my whole life. What about her? Don't say a word. She loves me. - I'm busy. - You're a doctor, right? Was. A man is dying. Everyone here is dying. This is my second day. I don't know what to do. Help me. Dude. Gosha. I just killed a man. Hold his head. Spoon. He's biting his tongue. Is he dying? Is this the end? It's just ordinary epilepsy. - I thought he was dying. - What have you been giving him? Ethosuximide as prescribed. Ethosuximide works for petit mal seizures. It won't help with a grand mal seizure. You learn that on day one. Where did they find you? - I'm a volunteer. - Got any carbamazepine, volunteer? - I'll go see. - Run. Faster! Easy, easy. Good job. Good job. Easy, easy. Good job. Mike. The archangel. - Hey. - What? Got any... booze? Let's see. - Where's the hole? - What hole? The round bullet hole. I'm telling you I didn't shoot him. He just fell dead. What? He fell down. He isn't breathing. - He died on his own? - Yeah. Dad, don't scare me like that next time. - Come on. - Where are you going? The hell away from here. Hurry up. But I killed him. Oh yeah? Wake up, Dad. He died on his own. Nobody saw you. Someone will find him. I can't do that. That's inhumane. Did you say inhumane? Why don't you say it's un-Christian? Calm down already. And try to control your desires. - In what sense? - You stick out like a sore thumb. - We should call an ambulance. - What can we tell them? That you wanted to kill Mom's boyfriend, but he died on his own? - You knew him? - And you didn't? Where are you taking her? To a burn center, of course. Will she be OK? - Her leg will heal, right? - We'll see. Can I go with her? - Who are you? - What do you mean? You know what I mean. He's my dad. I'm my dad. I'm sorry. I am sorry. Gosha, ...when did you find out? I mean, about him. I don't remember. I think I've always known. Why didn't you tell me? - About what? - About him. Why upset you? You felt sorry for me? Maybe so. Hey Gosha, ...what are we going to tell Mom? Nothing. But she'll be expecting him. She'll worry. Dad, are you totally out of your mind? Yeah, to tell you the truth. It's okay. It happens. The first time. - What do you mean the first time? - Never mind. Well? Happy now? The subscriber is unavailable. Please leave your message. Lenka, hi. Lena. Damn. Not that. Who wants seconds? Boys? - Me. - Me. You... Larisa... Keep it together. Don't cry. You have us. I love you so much. I love you... ...very, very much. I can't live without you. My heart... ...is ripped... into pieces. I love you so much. Lord. What a... ...bastard I am. I so want to keep living. I so want to keep living. - How's life? - Fine. You? Fine. Bird of happiness of tomorrow... Flew into my window. Pick me! Pick me! Bird of happiness of tomorrow! How much silver there is in the star-filled sky! Tomorrow will be better than yesterday! Better than yesterday! Better than yesterday! Tomorrow will be better than yesterday! Somewhere a guitar is playing. A true heart will hold on to love. My heart will hold on to love. But the bird of luck... ...will fly away again. When tomorrow morning comes, ...someone else will be first instead of me. Someone else, not me. Someone else, not me. It will be his turn to sing this song of tomorrow. My song will play. A true heart... ...will hold on to love. A true heart will hold on to love. And the bird of luck... ...will come back again.
