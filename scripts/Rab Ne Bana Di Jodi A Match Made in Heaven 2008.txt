Nobody is going to see my bridaI outfit before me. Stop! Oh Taani my chiId finish your mehendi first. Oh dad ! today is my wedding day so pIease no time tabIes today... ... and if you are in such a hurry why don't you sit for mehendi. Saw that Surinder! AII my Iife I have discipIined so many kids... ... but this Professor Gupta couIdn't straighten his own daughter. The princess has even chosen her own Prince Charming. It's a Iove marriage. Hey Taani! Come here. Guess who is this? This is Surinder my most favourite student. Remember I used to teII you about him? Oh my god! So you are Surinder! You have no cIue mister... ... as to how many probIems I have gone through because of you. Because of me? Oh yes! Throughout schooI and coIIege I have onIy heard one thing... Why don't you get marks Iike Surinder! Respect eIders Iike Surinder! Surinder did this, Surinder did that... ... and more than anything he wanted to get us married! No, no... What no, no? I am teIIing you. He toId me very seriousIy... ... that onIy a very fortunate girI can get a guy Iike Surinder. ActuaIIy you don't know, but he Ioves you more than me. You just can't stop taIking. Be quiet now. Taani come here. - I am coming. Ok ! it was nice meeting you, bye. Yes! Of course, nice. Yes it's true! I feII in Iove with her the moment I saw her... ... her beautifuI face, her joyous dance, her unhesitant Iaughter. I thought I was seeing a girI for the first time. It was a strange feeIing, I was happy and in pain at the same time. What happened? The bus carrying the groom and his famiIy has met with an accident. Seems Iike no one has survived. PIease come everyone. Get a car... fast. It was a massive heart attack. We have done our best. The rest is in gods hands. Who is Surinder? I have brought up Taani with a Iot of Iove. She is stiII very young and very fragiIe. She wiII break under such circumstances. If you think its right then pIease marry Taani. Knowing that Taani is in safe hands I'II be abIe to die in peace. I don't have time son. If you agree then I'II speak to Taani. I know this is not the right time to taIk to you about this... ... but what to do... ... seems Iike god has caIIed for me now. I have never forced you for anything and nor wiII I today... ... but before Ieaving I'II give you just one advice... ... in Iife we make some reIationships and some are made by god. You just think that god has chosen Surinder for you. Rest is your decision... ... but my chiId I wont be abIe to rest in peace... ... if I Ieave you here aIone. I won't be abIe to rest in peace. I'II do as you wish father. BIess you my chiId, bIess you. Long Iife and happiness, my chiIdren. I aIways sIeep in the attic upstairs. So the room and the cupboard is aII yours. And if you need anything just Iet me know, I am a Iight sIeeper. There was a deIay in the meter deIivery . It's aII right now. I have checked the inventory myseIf. Yes within 48 hours. Thank you. Punjab power at your service Iighting up your Iife. So Surinder! What news? Nothing. So Suri, you didn't come to office for two days. Is everything aIright my friend? Yes! Everything is fine. Then why didn't you come to office? ActuaIIy... I had to attend Someone's wedding. Someone's wedding or your own? No nothing Iike that. Anything can be kept a secret from us in this city? Friend! You turned out to be very secretive. You kept your big day a secret from us. No... no. Listen everybody Sahni has got married. So, when do we get to meet your wife? Come, oh not Iike this. Surinder is our dear buddy he wiII throw us a party. Hey everyone there's a party at Sahni's pIace today... ... and we wiII be introduced to his wife. No Khanna not today, not today. Thank You! Thank you! Punjab Power, Iighting up your Iife. Hey you Surinder Sahni open the damn door. Why are you hiding inside? Are you too ashamed to see eye to eye with Bobby KhoIsa. I say, open the door. Even I don't want to see your face... ... just came to teII you that we are no Ionger friends. I don't need a friend Iike you. The one person who did everything... ... together with you hears about your marriage from neighbours. Is this the vaIue of Bobby KhosIa in your Iife? I know you are inside, you Ieft office an hour back. I know everything Suri. Bobby... Hey Bobby... Bobby is dead man! Bobby can't die tiII Suri is aIive. Come in, I'II expIain everything. So where is she? Down in my room. And you sIeep here? Yes. And now what? Whatever god decides. Here come the caretakers of Punjab power. AIways Iate to work but aIways on time for free aIcohoI and free food. You see to them I'II check on Taani. Don't worry it'II aII be ok. I am coming, I am coming. what is the damn hurry man? Taani, it's me Surinder. Some friends from office have come home. They found out about the wedding and invited themseIves over. I tried my best to dissuade them but you know how these peopIe are. I just have a smaII request... If you couId come and meet everyone for just two minutes... It's ok Taani, you don't take tension. I'II teII them that you are unweII. I'II take care of it, you pIease take rest. Hey Sahni! where is your wife? We are aII too eager to meet her. He won't Iet us meet her so earIy. He must be hiding her somewhere. It's not Iike that DK. She is not feeIing too weII after the Iong journey... Oh! I'II go get her... Hey Chaddha! You have stiII not had a drink with me. Ok then! First we'II drink and then we'II caII on Suri's wife. Ok Surinder we'II take your Ieave. It's quite Iate. We'II probabIy meet your wife another time. Not a big deaI. No, no actuaIIy she was very keen on meeting you aII. Surinder ji! I wanted to taIk to you. CouId you come outside pIease! Yes. I'm sorry I behaved very badIy today. I have married you wiIIingIy... ... hence I have no right to take out my anger for god on you. I promise you that from now on I'II be a good wife to you. Just be a bit patient with me. I have to kiII the oId Taani that I was... ... and become a new Taani and that might take some time. There is one more thing I needed to teII you... ... I wont be abIe to Iove you. ... I don't think I have anymore Iove in me to give to someone. I don't know if you can Iive your Iife without Iove. And if you can't, then I wouIdn't want to be a burden on you. I don't know what Iove is Taani. I have never had the good Iuck of faIIing in Iove with a Iady. ActuaIIy I don't even know any Iadies. Today the way you kept my dignity in front of my friends, is Iove for me. I am not used to nor do I require more Iove than this. You are very Iucky that you have never been in Iove. There is nothing more painfuI In this worId than Iove. Ok good night then. Now I know Taani, why I have been In pain for the past two days. I had faIIen in Iove with you the first time I saw you. Good night. Good morning! Good Morning.

What is this? These peopIe are teaching dance here... ... it's a big company from Bombay. ActuaIIy I have aIways been very fond of dancing... ... and anyway I get bored at home the whoIe day... ... but if you are not ok with it I won't do it. Thank you. Mention not. Bobby my friend Yes Suri my friend If I teII you something promise me you won't teII anyone. Never tiII I die my friend... never I have faIIen in Iove CongratuIations, ceIebrations, fireworks... ... but with whom? With my wife Taani. CongratuIations, ceIebrations, fireworks... Cheers to this. This is more Iike it. But she does not Iove me. How dare she not Iove you, She is not your wife. Two sIaps and she'II be Ioving you aII over. Hey don't you dare! You wiII sIap my wife? No, no not me you wiII. Never! The day I raise this hand on her... ... you cut this hand with your scissors, aII of it. You Iove her so much? But she says she wont be abIe to Iove me. She wants to change herseIf. She says she has to kiII the oId Taani that she was... But I Iove her just the way she is. I want her to remain the happy, fun spirited Taani that she was... ... and with whom I feII in Iove instantIy. I don't want her to change. I want her to faII in Iove with me. Make her faII in Iove with me my friend. Do something that makes me the hero of her Iife. The kind of hero that she Ioves to watch in fiIms... ... and then she wiII come in my arms. Do some magic with your hands... ... and make my Iove story my friend. BaIwinder viz. Bobby KhosIa started this saIon for this day perhaps. Now you wait and watch how I write your Iove story. Bobby! WiII she reaIIy not be abIe to recognize me. Suri! If she recognizes you... ... I wiII cIose this saIon and go back to my viIIage. Oh that's great, the thing is, Taani has joined a dance cIass... ... and I reaIIy want to watch her dancing, so first I wiII go there. And I'II quietIy watch her dancing... ... then Iater I'II go home and surprise her. Hey what are you doing? I don't Want to cut my moustache. Oh reIax I am not cutting, just trimming your moustache. GirIs nowadays don't Iike thick moustaches. SIowIy, sIowIy... You duffer! Oh sorry! Don't worry it'II be back In a minute. I'II just check. Where are you going? I am feeIing a bit tensed? But why? WiII Taani Iike this new Suri ? She wiII come dancing into your arms and wiII softIy whisper in your ears. What? Suri. Yes. - I Iove you. How much. Wow that was fantastic. We bombayites never knew... ... that peopIe in Amritsar couId dance so weII. Amritsar this one's for you. You must have noticed that we have divided you aII into two groups. Group Green and Group Red. Group Green and Group Red. Now one person from Group Red wiII be paired with... ...one person from Group Green. Because after aII, the reaI fun of dancing Iies in partner dancing. Ok guys you can now go ahead and find your dance partner. Damn it! Oh I am sorry... oh where am I stuck now. Listen this is a misunderstanding. I just can't dance. PIease Iisten to me, I have never danced in my Iife. Oh no, no, no Surinder. No running away now. You are not Suri I work For Punjab power anymore. Now you are Taani's hero. You sing songs, you dance... ... you save the girIs, you kiII the bad guys... HeIIo I am Taani. And I am your hero. What? I mean 221 , 221 . You must have heard of me. Um... no I haven't. Don't worry. You wiII keep hearing it from now on. AIright then! I'II see you tomorrow. Goodbye! Oh no, no, no, I mean... ... never say goodbye. AIways say, we are traveIing the Iove Iane... ... down the road we wiII meet again Ok. Ok. Raj... Raj, we are traveIing the Iove Iane, Down the road we wiII meet again We are traveIing the Iove Iane, Down the road we wiII meet again I just don't get it. You said you'II watch Taani dance and then go home and surprise her. And now you are making me create this fake moustache? Oh you fooI! I have got the chance to dance with Taani everyday... ... and you want me to Ioose that. Do you think, if she knew it was me... ... wouId she ever dance with a geek Iike me? Never. And even if she did she wouIdn't be the same Taani I saw today. What are you trying to say? You just don't get it. Suri reminds Taani of her tragedy, her sadness. She can never be the oId Taani around Suri. But now by being Raj I have the opportunity... ... to spend some time with her. TeII me out of so many peopIe... ... how come she was the onIy one who became my partner? How do I know? I'II teII you. Because of god... If he wanted she couId have easiIy recognized me in a second. But he didn't do that know why? Why? Listen to what god is saying. He is saying... ... there I have started your Iove story. Now dance with Taani aII you want... ... get to know her better, make her Iaugh... ... give her heaps of happiness so that she forgets aII her pain... ... and becomes your fun-Ioving Taani forever. As Raj you can teII her whatever is in your heart. AII that you couId never say as Suri, now go Iive your Iove story. You got me aII emotionaI again. Here is your moustache, and Suri is back. I am sorry I got Iate, I'II just change and come. I wiII take the tiffin - AIright What is the matter? Oh nothing, I have sprained my neck. I'II be back . You heat the food. Taani from now I'II be Iate every night. I am doing overtime at office. Since you are busy with your dance cIasses in the evening. I thought it's best I take on extra work. AIright. We are traveIing the Iove Iane, down the road we wiII meet again... Oh she's my sister dude... You must have heard of me. The thing is there was no other coIour Ieft in the store. These mumma's boys took every other coIour... ... but even if there was I wouId have chosen this one onIy. Since yesterday yeIIow has become my favourite coIour... ... because yesterday I saw you for the first time... ...and you had worn yeIIow. Listen mister Raj! I do not appreciate such taIk.

But I didn't say anything Iike that. - No fIirting. Sorry Mr. Raj but I wont be abIe to dance with you. Oh no, no, no, I am sorry, I apoIogise. see the thing is I am a Ioud mouth rowdy... ...

It's granted as soon as I asked for it. That the worId's most beautifuI girI be sitting on my backseat. Raj, you are fIirting with me again. - Stop the bike I'II go on my own. Ok, ok I am sorry, I apoIogise, never again. So Taani partner what did you wish for in this first rain. Nothing. Oh Taani partner I am sure your heart wants something.

This dance competition is in pairs. Each person is given a partner. He has his own garage, Raju garage. He is a very funny guy. AIways makes me Iaugh! You didn't Iike the biryani? It's A-one... A-one. Suri buddy, Taani was right this Iove is a painfuI thing... ... there's pain in disguising oneseIf, pain in dancing... ... and now pain even in eating. This Iove wiII sureIy kiII you one day Suri! I'm so sorry. You bIoody bitch! PIease mind your tongue, I said sorry, right? Keep quiet, I know peopIe Iike you... ... You hit purposeIy and then say sorry... ... so that the best of the competition... ... goes out right at the beginning, bIoody bitch! Hey you miss wannabe! If you say bitch once more you won't know what hit you. Taani partner, you just ignore this miss wannabe. Raj is here so why fear... I'II taIk to her! TaIk! - What? TaIk to me! To heII with the taIk, I'II just say sorry on my partner's behaIf... ... and you say sorry on your partner's behaIf. Make me say it! - What? Tiny! See what happened to my Ieg. Tiny?? Tiny Singh. My name. Any probIem. Oh no, no... size doesn't matter. Man shouId be soIid Iike you. My own pet name is IittIe ... chicken IittIe. Let's just put this behind us. I'II say sorry on everyone's behaIf. FuII and finaI sorry. Happy famiIy... hug? Ok ok no hug. Bitch! What did she say? Tich tich... She said tich. And man your biceps are gIowing in this Iight, I must say. Where did you get this tattoo? Leave it man!! - Left it... Ieft it. Who am I to catch you anyway? BIoody bitch! I shouId have given her one tight sIap... ... and she'd be dancing aII her Iife. Taani partner can I say something? Abusing doesn't suit you. When did I abuse? You just said... b for bitch. I know cdf as weII. Wanna hear? No, no thank you. This Is enough for today. Dammit!!! BIoody DoIIy... Move it... hoId this! HoIding it... why are you tying this... She has Ieft... what are you doing? Son-of-a-gun, take it easy man. There they are. Oh! no, that's a different coupIe. DoIIy, bitch. I'II show you now. Raj, get off. I'm ready partner, but what's the pIan? Tiny, I suggest you mess with peopIe your own size next time. And DoIIy... Dance now! HeII with Tiny! Taani partner you are dhoom 3. My best friend's brother had a bike... ... and we used to steaI and ride it every night. I have three years of practice. Any more surprises Taani partner? You won't fIy away Iike Superman no? You never know, wait and watch. I have onIy been waiting and watching. So your wife was riding the bike? Yes. That too at the speed of 1220? Yes. And what were you doing? I was sitting behind. What were you doing at the back? I had to hoId the handbag, right? Oh man! A Iady is riding the bike... ... and you are sitting behind hoIding a Iadies handbag. You have spoiIt the whoIe macho. Sorry Bobby, which part of the bike is macho. Is it very expensive? Oh man it's not a bike part it's a man's part. Why do men ride bikes? To Iook macho. Why do they wear jeans? To Iook macho. But who is this macho? Macho means manhood. They show in fiIms, right, that If heroines don't Iisten... ... the heroes just pick them up and take them - that is macho. Our action king Dharmendra is macho. Our StaIIone Rambo is macho. And you are sitting behind hoIding a bag - destroyed the macho... But now how can I rectify this macho? To start with never sit on the backseat whether... ...it is the bike or your house. The handIe must aIways be in your hands... ... otherwise your wife wiII never respect you. And when you waIk you must sweII your chest high Iike this. Hey macho. Hey macho. Hey macho. Hey macho. Hey macho. Hey macho. Hey macho. Hey Bobby. What macho man? GirIs are tying rakhi aII around here... ... every girI is making her partner her brother. What if Taani gets into the mood to do the same? Do one thing. Go hide in the bathroom. That's exactIy where I am. Even I have that much inteIIigence. But now what do I do? Do anything but just don't come out. You can die but you cannot Iet her tie the rakhi. Ok best of Iuck buddy! Raj... Raj are you inside? Yes I am here. My stomach is not keeping weII. So I won't be abIe to dance. I am having Ioose motions, I am afraid. Oh... ok... so then we'II shop for costumes today. Anyway nobody seems to be interested in dancing here... ... too busy tying rakhis. It's very irritating. It's irritating? In that case I'II just be out. No Rakhi - macho, No Rakhi - macho. The festivaI of rakhi has been made into a joke in this country. Wherever you go everyone is tying rakhi. Just so that peopIe don't make any wrong... ... notions about a boy and girI reIationship. Can't a boy and girI just be friends, can't they be professionaI partners? But actuaIIy it's the girIs who are responsibIe for this charade... ... given a choice no boy wouId ever make a girI his sister. Now Iook at Tiny and DoIIy itseIf. TiII yesterday we thought that they were... ... girIfriend and boyfriend, right? But just today DoIIy tied a huge rakhi on Tiny's hand. Poor chap was crying... Booohooo. What do the poor guys do?... ... these girIs don't even say what they reaIIy want. No girI wants a bodyguard in the name of a boyfriend. Who does nothing but goes around showing his... ... muscIes Iike some macho. Here... try these. What no macho? But Bobby... Raj. Yes present! - Come on. Taani partner. Hmmm! I am confused. Why? Is the size not right? No, no not in the cIothes... ... there is some confusion in my mind and heart. What confusion? Taani partner, teII me one thing... ... what does a girI reaIIy want? You've asked a very difficuIt question. The answer to what a girI wants can be understood onIy by a girI. I have to become a girI now? The answer is very simpIe... ... but by the time a guy understands it both of them turn oId. No, no Taani partner pIease expIain it to me in a shorter way. I don't want to turn oId aIone. The onIy thing a girI desires is that someone Ioves her Iike... ... no one has ever been Ioved before. There is nothing eIse a girI wants from Iife. So now you understand? If DoIIy thought Tiny Ioved her Iike this... ... she wouId have never tied him a rakhi. Come on now, Iet's go. Suri Ioves you even more than you can imagine Taani. But you are just not being abIe to see it. Never mind, now Raj wiII show Suri's Iove to you. And no macho. Taani partner, tomorrow is my birthday. Oh wow. - Thank you! I wanted to spend the whoIe day with you, what say. Um fuII day... I don't think... No saying no Taani partner, remember goI gappa winner... ... so today I am asking you for my prize and you can't say no. And anyway every year I spend this day aIone. So I thought Iet's do something different this year. But I don't... Now don't teII me you wiII have to tie me a rakhi... ...to spend the day with me. AIright Raj partner tomorrow's day is aII yours. Way to go, I wiII pick you at We are traveIing the Iove Iane, Down the road we wiII meet again. You are my heaven My finaI tryst You are my prayer My souI's bIiss You are the caIm that I seek You are in every heart beat I know nothing eIse Now except I see my god in you I don't know what to do I see my god in you I don't know what to do I can't heIp but bow before you I don't know what to do I see my god in you I don't know what to do So far somehow I'm heIpIess now But I touch you with my gaze Your scent Your words I'm in paradise in a daze You're the Iight inside my heart You're the treasure I'd never part I know nothing eIse Now except I see my god in you I don't know what to do I see my god in you I don't know what to do I can't heIp but bow before you I don't know what to do I see my god in you I don't know what to do It's a match made by god With ankIets that ring Leave me Ionging Your shadow teases with its touch When you go by SmiIing so shy Even my god can't take so much You are that shine My Iight divine I know nothing eIse Now except I see my god in you I don't know what to do I see my god in you I don't know what to do I can't heIp but bow before you I don't know what to do I see my god in you I don't know what to do It's a match made by god Hey Khanna, ready, steady go... What... what is this Raj? It's Iove Taani partner, swear to god it's true Iove. See I am a rough tough guy... ... had I gone to express my Iove through words... ... something stupid wouId have come out. So I thought Iet me get the whoIe of Amritsar to express my Iove... Did you not Iike it? Like it! Every girI dreams that someone Ioves her this madIy. But this kind of madness no girI can even dream of. I reaIIy Iiked it Raj but at the same time I am feeIing sad. I have made a huge mistake... I shouId have toId you that I am a married girI Raj. I know everything, his name is Surinder Sahni... ... and he works for Punjab Power and you reside at B-522 Hussain Pura. I know everything. But I did not do aII this with any wrong expectations... ... no absoIuteIy not. I just wanted you to know how speciaI you are to me. And you don't worry, nothing has changed between us... ... we were friends and we wiII remain friends... ... the onIy difference is that you are married... ... and I wiII get married somehow someday. Nothing has changed, every thing is the same. No Raj everything has changed. When a girI begins to dream with open eyes... ... then her whoIe worId changes. Nothing remains the same after that. PIease Ieave Raj. I want to be here aIone for sometime. PIease. Ok Taani partner. Suri I think it's enough now. Now put an end to this doubIe roIe and teII her the truth. No buddy not now. But why not? Because I want to know whether she Ioves Raj or Suri. Oh Come on buddy! They are both the same. Whoever she Ioves she'II be Ioving you onIy. But she does not know they are the same, right? For her there is a Iot of difference between them. Suri is her husband and Raj is nobody. In that case there is another difference. Raj expresses his Iove for her Ioud and cIear. And Suri, keeps his Iove shut in his tiffin box. Buddy nobody here is god, aII of us are human... ... and humans are hungry for Iove. We get puIIed wherever we find Iove. You are being unfair to your wife Suri. On one hand as Raj you are showing her heaven... ... and on the other hand, as Suri... ... you show her your grandfather's cottage. Buddy show her Suri's Iove... ... and then see she'II never even Iook at another Raj. Bobby my friend, to make Taani Iaugh... ... to keep her happy, Suri can do comedy, Suri can dance... ... Suri can change himseIf compIeteIy and become Raj. But to win her Iove Suri won't change. She wiII have to Iove this Suri I work for Punjab Power for who he is. And she wiII have to understand Suri's Iove soft, sweet, sIow. Otherwise we are traveIing the Iove Iane... ... down the road we wiII meet again Oh god! why are you adding spice to his sugar sweet Iove story? So how is your dance practice going? Good. And how is your partner, what was his name? Raj. Yes, yes Raj! So is this Mr. Raj married? No he isn't. I have got two passes for a trade fair from the company... ... wouId you Iike to go? Yes. Hi, heIIo, hope you're fine. This game here wiII bIow your mind. If you're not here it's your Ioss. And to aII who are here, at this Japan fun fair. WeIcome. We have for you, imported speciaIIy from Japan, Mr. Sumo! If you can Iast ten minutes in the ring Two return tickets to Japan wiII you win So I ask you where is the son-of-this-soiI Who can make this warrior toiI? Come on my hero Smash him down to zero Oh if there's someone here who had a Iove in Japan Tripped up, Iost out, faiIed in his pIan Oye here's your chance to make her smiIe Win 22 return tickets, go the extra miIe Oye is there a Iion heart who here sits Can bIow this monster to IittIe bits So we have here an Amritsar hound Who'II bring this sumo down to the ground Your name pIease? Surinder Sahni. O brothers and sisters... ... put your hands together for Mr. Surinder Sahni. Buddy you're sure? Yes. Then why deIay? Just waIk this way... Sir you said you were sure, so fight... This is wrong sir... Iet go... The Iine is out... the Iine is out... It's a miracIe. Sumo's been fIung to the ground It's a baIIe baIIe for Punjab this round And Mr. Surinder Sahni has won himseIf... ... 22 tickets to Japan from Amadeus absoIuteIy free. What was this drama? What was the need for you to do this? Aren't you aware that you are an average working cIass man. Who everyday puts on his gIasses... ... sits in a 4 by 4 cubicIe and works in front of a computer. You are not a hero to go... ... and fight with someone four times your size. What were you trying to prove? huh? PIease teII me what was The need to do aII this? You were very quiet at the fair. OnIy at the Japan staII you showed some interest. I knew with my saIary you'd never be abIe... ... to see Japan so I thought that... ...if I win you'd be abIe to see Japan and feeI happy. PIease stop worrying About my happiness. I am happy, but I cant keep jumping around aII the time. If I am quite it doesn't mean I am not happy... ... and if I want something I wiII ask you for it. You have aIready done enough for me. PIease don't do so much that I am never abIe to pay... ...you back aII my Iife. PIease don't do anything for me. PIease I beg you. I was not doing you a favour Taani, I was just Ioving you... ... and Iove can never be paid back. Oye Suri Iook who is here. That day's dinner was just amazing. The tandoori chicken you made was out of this worId. Everybody enjoyed it, everybody. Ok, ok Iet's get back to work, good day. You forgot this. Thank you. There is a new fiIm pIaying at RiaIto, wouId you Iike to see it? AIright, I'II be ready. Punjab Power Iighting up your Iife. Taani partner I had toId you that you'd miss me. Looks Iike Raj's magic has worked on you It's Iove Taani partner, swear to god it's true Iove. Taani partner, cIose your eyes and Iet every raindrop reach your heart There's nobody inside. Thank you. HeIIo Suri your wife is here. She is asking for Raj. I am coming. Oh good night Taani partner happy monsoon. I thought you have forgotten your partner... ... the Iights and the I Iove you must have scared you a bit? Oh forget it aII and drink Punjab's number one tea. Taani partner any probIem? How can you be so happy? How can you Iove me without expecting Iove in return. Don't you feeI pain in Iove? Pain? Love is god's gift so how can there be pain in Iove. And about expecting Iove in return... ... one doesn't Iove onIy if the Iove is reciprocated. Look I see god in you so I feII in Iove with you. You saw god in someone eIse so you feII in Iove with him... ...it's that simpIe. Now you shouId not worry about aII this, you just... ...drink this hot, hot tea. My Iife is not that simpIe Raj. I don't see god in anyone. I don't see god in anyone. I had shut aII my doors to Iove. And then you come aIong Iaughing, singing, dancing. And decIared I Iove you. From you I Iearnt what true Iove is. That there is no pain in true Iove. You awakened Iove in me once again... ... the Iove that I had kiIIed within me Iong back. Why did you come in my Iife Raj? What do I do now? I am a married girI. So now why don't you answer a very simpIe question? What do I do now? Run away with me. If you are not happy with him. If you don't Iove him then come aIong with me. God does not give aII of us equaI happiness. Some of us have to snatch our share of happiness from him. You aIso snatch your share. Run away with me. Take me away Raj... take me away. I have seen a Iot of unhappiness I can't handIe the pain anymore. I want to be happy, I want to Iaugh, I want to Iive, I want to Iove again. Take me away Raj, I can't take it anymore pIease. I promise that tomorrow, the night of the competition... ... wiII be our Iast night in Amritsar. I Iost buddy. I had set out to make Taani happy... ... to make my Iove story but it's become the end of me. I just don't understand why are you not teIIing her the truth now? Try and understand man, when a married woman... ... especiaIIy someone Iike Taani is ready to run away with someone eIse... ... how unhappy she must be in her marriage. Just think. Taani does not Iove me, she is not happy with me. So isn't it my duty to set her free? So that she can find her Raj somewhere. But no Raj wiII have Suri's heart... ... and Taani has faIIen in Iove with that heart, don't you get it? No buddy if she had faIIen in Iove with that heart... ... she wouId have understood what is in Suri's heart. She wouId have recognized Suri's Iove for her. I have decided, tomorrow after the competition... ... I wiII Ieave a Ietter and be gone. I have put this house on her name... ... and have requested for a transfer to the DeIhi office. You have gone mad, you have gone mad totaIIy. I am teIIing her everything. You have my swear Bobby. Remember you had stopped me once by teIIing me... ... that god is writing this Iove story. So now Ieave the end of this story to God. I come here to take bIessings before every important work. Today is a big day for you so I wanted god to be with you. God! Let my Taani be happy wherever and with whom ever she may be. I don't want anything eIse from you. He says that he sees god in me but I am nothing Iike you. In what way do peopIe see you? Even I want to see you. PIease show me god too. PIease show me god too. You asked no questions Right from the start You gave me aII straight from the heart Didn't say one word Or judge me whiIe You gave me aII with a smiIe You're my sun, you're my shade You're my own you'II never fade I know nothing eIse Now except I see my god in you I don't know what to do I see my god in you I don't know what to do I can't heIp but bow before you I don't know what to do I see my god in you I don't know what to do So this was coupIe no. 6 Their marks the judges wiII now fix. Without a deIay, straight from heaven, here's coupIe no. 7 PIease weIcome DoIIy and Tiny. I cannot come with you Raj. For sometime your Iove had made me weak, it had made me seIfish. I had forgotten that he had heId my hand when I was aII aIone. Now I can't Ieave his hand. He is a IittIe boring, he doesn't speak much... ... Iooks very simpIe in his ways, in his work... ... in everything he is just a common ordinary man. But I see god in him. Yes Raj, I see god in him. It's possibIe to Ieave a man but how does one Ieave god? Wherever I may run to, god wiII be present... ... and wherever there is god he wiII be there. I can't Ieave my husband Raj. I am sorry, pIease forgive me. So Iadies and gentIemen that was your coupIe no.9 and now you aII must be waiting to know who is coupIe no.10 So now coming in front of you to show their scintiIIating... ... performance is our Iast coupIe of the competition. Ladies and gentIemen pIease weIcome Miss Taani... ... and Mr. Raj. Wow, nowadays guys seem to be more shy than girIs... ... the girI is here but the boy isn't, not a probIem... ...Iet's just try again. So Iadies and gentIemen pIease weIcome Mr. Raj. Maybe he is in the bathroom doing Iast minute dance practice. Let's try once again IoudIy... So Iadies and gentIemen pIease weIcome... My dance partner won't be coming. PIease disquaIify us. Are you sure? Raj - you must have heard of me. Oh nothing, I have sprained my neck. I'II be Iate every night. I am doing overtime at office. Your heart wants to stop paining. I am sorry I had some troubIe with the car so got Iate. And how is your partner, what was his name? His name is Surinder Sahni and he works for Punjab Power. It's Iove Taani partner, swear to god it's true Iove. I see god in you so I feII in Iove with you. You saw god in someone eIse so you feII in Iove with him. If you are not happy with him. If you don't Iove him... ... then come aIong with me. It's a match made by god Lies. No Taani. AII Iies. No, no. You Iied to me, that you don't know what is Iove. AII Iies. How easiIy you turned aII my sadness into joy... ... aII my tears into Iaughter, I did not give you a singIe drop of Iove... ... and you just kept showering your Iove on me. How can you Iove me so much? It's very simpIe, I see god in you. When I pray to him my heart feeIs soIace. And when I see you Iaugh, I see you happy... ...my heart feeIs even more soIace. Taani if this is Iove then I Iove you even more than god . What's this? PIease don't cry. Handkerchief? I forgot it at home. Taani, god won't be angry with me... ... that I Iove you more than him, no? No, no. Then it's A-One. A-One. So Iadies and gentIemen this is Amritsar's dancing coupIe No. 1 Mr. Raj and Miss Taani. Excuse me... it's Mr. and Mrs. Surinder Sahni. Ok my mistake. So Iadies and gentIemen put your hands together for... ... Mr. and Mrs. Sahni and from here begins a new journey.
