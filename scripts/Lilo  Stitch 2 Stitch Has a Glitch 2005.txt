(COUGHS) (LAUGHS) Stitch, why are you doing this? Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Please stop. (GROWLS) (GASPS) Stop it, Stitch. Don't... No! Stitch! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Stitch. Wake up. Stitch, wake up. It's all right. Don't worry. You were just having another nightmare. - Seems like a bad one. - (MUTTERS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE) You know what this means, don't you? Hmm. Very interesting. Why don't you tell me what happened next? Well... (MUTTERS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE) (MIMICS EXPLOSION) - Mmm, I see. - Then... (MIMICS MACHINE GUN) And then... (SHRIEKING) And then... (GASPS) That's it. No more. It's my professional opinion that you're afraid of turning bad again. We need to test your goodness level. For example, someone bad would let this Elvis Blue Hawaii lamp, circa 1971, smash to pieces against that wall. Or let my favorite book, Plastic Surgeries Gone Wrong, drop out this window to be lost forever. Yah! Waagh! Or let his family member fall to her painful, crushing death. No! See? Look at all the good things you did. My prognosis? Your goodness level is extra high. Nothing to worry about. WOMAN: Lilo! Stitch! You're gonna be late for hula class. Except that. (ELECTRIC BUZZING) - LILO: Stitch! - (GASPS) Hurry up, you two. Hey, can you guys help me today? It's family night. - I want the house clean. - Not me. I have very important project I've been working on. - No more crop circles! - Ah! Oh... All the other aliens get to make them. - What about you? - I have a full day of Earth research. Watching talk shows and reading magazines? Yeah, it takes it out of ya. Can we take the hovercraft? Please? It's too dangerous. Besides, someone may see you. - Please? - Please? All right, you can take it if you can find it. Yes! I hid it so good this time, they're never... Thanks, Nani. Aw! I gotta find a better hiding place for that thing. STITCH: Whoa! Whoa! There's no place I'd rather be (CHORUS IN HAWAIIAN) Lingering in the ocean blue Oops. Sorry! I'd surf till the sun sets beyond the horizon Flying by on a Hawaiian rollercoaster ride (CHORUS IN HAWAIIAN) (LAUGHS) - (BOTH LAUGHING) - Hawaiian rollercoaster ride There's no place I'd rather be Girls, I have very exciting news. This week is our May Day... Sorry I'm late. But wait till you see this. I got my 'uli'uli technique down. - Lilo... - Kui kala laima! Ho kee ma! Uliuli, uliuli, ha! - Lilo? - Uliuli, uliuli, ha! Uliuli, uliuli, ha! Lilo, we're not doing that today. We're not doing that today. Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah. Bleugh! (GROWLS) Kumu has an announcement. In three days is our town's May Day celebration. And here's the best part. There will be a hula competition. Each of you will create an original hula. The one that best expresses the aloha spirit will lead our halau as the winning dance. You, you, you! - Are there any questions? - Kumu, I have one. Will people who are late to class be allowed to participate? Mertle, I think in the spirit of aloha, we should be tolerant of others. Well, there's no harm in asking. I want you to use class time today to begin working on your ideas. The May Day celebration is big time. The whole town will be there. Maybe I'll get a contract. We can do any idea we want. Even make our own costumes. - Cool! - It'll be a lot of work. My mom knows how to make great costumes. My mom can sew really good. My mom knows a lot about hula. She can help me with it. - I guess Lilo's on her own. - She doesn't have a mom. - Don't say that. - It's the truth. - Not everyone has a mom. - All right, don't bite my head off. I don't know what costume I'm gonna wear. Lilo, may I speak with you? This is a book of past winners. Do you know who this is? It's your mother. - My mom? - Aye. She won the competition when she was your age. She was as beautiful as an orchid and as graceful as a rolling wave. Here. To inspire you. Mmm. That's my mom. She won the competition when she was my age. Yay! Hey, Lilo. Maybe your dog can take a picture of me when I win the competition. - How do you know you'll win? - It's pretty well known that I'm the best dancer in the seven-year-old division. I don't know. I think maybe I can win. Hello? You're a stinky dancer, and anything you come up with will be stinky. - Oh! - Uh-uh. You'll never be like your mom. Never. - Okay. - That's it! Smile. (SCREAMING) (CAMERA SHUTTER) As you can see, there was a little disagreement... - Again. - Ai-ya. Next time, flush the evidence. Ka-shush. Why don't you come inside, Kumu? Excuse the mess. KUMU: Ooh-we. We have a full house. Make yourself at home, Kumu. I just made some lemonade. - Wha... - Hey! Nani, we're out of lemonade. Pleakley, I just made that. Nani. You have to come to lab and see my new invention. I just mopped in here! It will improve your primitive earthly life. Speaking of improving your life, I've just been reading this article called Ten Days To A Slimmer You. Full of wonderful suggestions. Guys, I don't have time for this. We have a guest. A guest? Well, let's go meet him. Let's not. Lilo's in enough trouble. - BOTH: Trouble? - Well, all out of lemonade. Anyway, I know my sister is very sorry and didn't mean it. - Very sorry. - See? - But I did mean it. - Lilo? Next time, Mertle Edmonds is going down. She's going way down. - (MIMICS CROWD CHEERING) - (NANI CHUCKLES) No more pro wrestling for you. Where is she? Where is she? - Wow. - Ai-kapulu. There's our precious angel, who must be the victim of a misunderstanding. - Oh, no, no... - Where is she? - Jumba. What are you doing? - Don't worry. The cavalry has arrived. - There she is. - No, no, no, no. Somebody give this kid gold star, she's so good. I don't believe we've met. This is Uncle Jumba and I'm Auntie Pleakley. Enchante. On second thought, Kumu, we should talk outside. It's not polite to interrupt your auntie. - Knock, knock. - David. How's it, everybody? You remember my Auntie Pleakley and Uncle Jumba, right? - Uh... - Say something. Uh... - Nice hat. - Why, thank you, David. See? Uncle Jumba said it made me look top-heavy. Aunt Pleakley wanted the truth. What we want and what we need are entirely different things. It's true what they say. Men are from Mars, and women are from Venus. - Nani. - Yeah? Uh-huh? You've been stressing, so I got movie tickets. Movie? David, I would love to, really, but I'm gonna have to rain check. - That's okay. I understand. - Great. Thanks for understanding. I dare you to say that's not flattering, even on him. Okay, I'm sure that Kumu isn't interested in this. - Nice to be meeting you. - Au revoir. Bye-bye. Boy. Good thing we were here. I'm not talking to you. Ha-ha... Sorry about the relatives, Kumu. Yeah, sorry. Thanks for coming. See ya at the competition. (LOCK CLICKS) Lilo? I know you want to be in the competition, but your behavior today makes me think you're not ready. No. I'm ready. It's just... Mertle pushed my buttons. I'll be good. I mean it. I hope so. If there's any more trouble, you won't be allowed in the competition. I promise. There won't be any trouble. I promise, promise. I triple promise. - Okay, then. - Thank you, Kumu. You don't have to worry. I've seen the error of my ways. I will be good from now on and be the best hula dancer ever. You'll see. I can do it. There's no way I can do this. Just because my mom was a great hula dancer doesn't mean I am. The only thing I know I inherited from her is, well, Nani. Yeuch! What if Mertle's right and everything I do is gonna be stinky? Maybe I'm just stinky... Like cheese. (MUTTERS) But my mom was beautiful like an orchid and graceful like a wave. I'll never be like her. You think I can do it? We do together. Let's win this thing. - Okey... - Dokey. Hula ideas, take one. Mummies. (STITCH MOANS) Huh? Amputation. Vampire bats. Recycling. - Gossip. - (GASPS) Skydive. Ouch. I wonder if Elvis had these problems. Done. Okay, everyone, family fun night is ready to begin. Everyone? Anyone? Guys, family fun night. Everything's ready. Let's... What's going on? We're increasing the flow of blood to our brains to make us think. - We've only got one day and 23 hours... - And 16 minutes. ...to come up with the winning idea, so please leave us alone to think. Please. You'll figure it out, and if you ask me, it's a perfect time to take a break. - Pass. - Pass. - I said, if you ask me, it's... - We kinda didn't ask you. That's it, you two. I've been cooking for hours and finally picked up the house just so we can have quality fun time like Mom used to. You're part of this family, so you are gonna come downstairs and have family fun. Fun, fun, fun! (SHRIEKING) Is everyone having fun? ALL: Oh, yeah! - Great. - Loads of fun! - I made sci-fi snacks. - Yummy. We have deep-fried Martian cockroach. Mm. Delicious - I think I'm gonna throw up. - Ew. I think someone did. Uh, Nani, what are these? Alien eyeball dumplings. What kinda sick joke is this? Don't be making her mad. Eat it. It's good. - Cockroach? - I'm too upset to eat. I'm hula-less. Aw, I'm sure you'll come up with something. Come on. Let's watch the movie. ...are dangerous. They'll destroy everything in their path. The authorities are asking all... - It's a bit redundant, don't ya think? - Shush. I'm trying to watch movie. Ew. (JUMBA BLUBBERING, SNIFFLING) It's so beautiful. Nani, I think you did a great job with family night. - Psst. I know what your problem is. - What? I'm sorry to break it to you, but your relationship has fizzled. We've been only going out for three weeks. A fizzle is a fizzle. According to this, comfort plus time equals boring. DAVID: I think she's just tired. - Tired, or tired of you? - Shh. I wanted to dance at your wedding, but... - Shh. - Fine. (LAUGHTER) - (ZAPPING) - (STITCH YELPS) Hmm? Hmm. Mm-mm. Ow! Huh? What? (STITCH YELLS) - Ah, Stitch! - Oh, Stitch! Stitch? (JABBERS) Oh, no. Jumba, Jumba, slow down! Where ya going? Include me! Something's wrong with 626. - What is it? - I don't know. Or won't tell? Ow! My good eye! You don't trust me. Fine. You won't tell me what's going on. I won't tell you something. Ooh, what an interesting secret I have that I won't tell Jumba. Oh, my, it's a juicy one. - Quiet, you. - Okay, I don't have a secret. But don't shut me out. Let me in. Let me... - What's that? - Is sample of Stitch's fur. Now we shall see. (BEEPING) No. No. Those idiot police. I hoped this day would never come. What are you talking about? What is wrong with Stitch? During his creation, Stitch was never fully charged. (LAUGHTER) There is it. (CACKLING) (CACKLING CONTINUES) (COUGHS) That's not so easy on the throat. Oh, can it be? Have I done it? (WHIMPERS) So cute, so fluffy, even. (SNIFFS) Where did I go wrong? Ha-ha-ha! What a relief. Your name is 626. Isn't that nice? (GROWLS) Oh, I know, I know. You want to get out and wreak havoc, but your molecules need to be charged. That's most important part. (BLEEPING) Meanwhile, I've got a surprise for you. Close your eyes. No peeking. He cheats already. Aw, jiggiebig. - Ta-da! - (MUTTERS) If it's too big, I have it taken in. - (BANGING) - Uh-oh. - Open up! Intergalactic Police! - Is nobody home. Uh, check is in mail. (HIGH-PITCHED) I'm in the tub. You are under arrest for illegal genetic experimentation. You idiots, you will ruin everything. - Oh, no. - Yeah. Tell it to the Council. You two, get the evidence. Stop. His molecules aren't fully charged. No, no! No! Oh. COMPUTER: Warning. Warning. Electromagnetic bonding incomplete. No, no, there's no telling what will happen. Let me go. No! What will become of my little monstrosity? Now his circuits are going haywire. That's why he was freaking out. He can't control it. If it continues, his circuits will burn themselves out like supernova. Can ya... Can ya fix him? I must, or my little Stitch will shut down... For good. - (FOOTSTEPS) - (GASPS) Stitch? Stitch? (WHIMPERS) Once there was a boy with big, puffy hair who loved meat loaf a lot. So he put the leftovers in his pillowcase. But that night, a buzzard flew in the window and tried to eat the meat loaf. Trashed the whole house. And do you know who that boy was? - Elvis. - Huh? True story. I think Stitch feel better. Even Elvis slipped up sometimes. But he never stopped trying, and neither can we. - Elvis! - Elvis! (BUGLE PLAYS REVEILLE) At ease. When Elvis was in the army, he got things done. Here's a map that shows every place Elvis went to in Kauai. Our mission, go to these places, where the King will give us the idea for our hula. To the hovercraft. Thanks to a certain sister of mine, we'll have to walk. (ELVIS PRESLEY: RUBBERNECKIN') Stop, look and listen, baby That's my philosophy It's called rubberneckin', baby But that's all right with me Stop, look and listen, baby That's my philosophy It's called rubberneckin', baby But that's all right with me Some people say I'm wasting time They don't really know I like what I see, I see what I like It gives me such a glow Yeah, yeah, yeah First thing in the morning Last thing at night I look, stare everywhere And I see everything in sight Stop, look and listen, baby That's my philosophy It's called rubberneckin', baby But that's all right with me People say I'm wasting time But I don't really care I see what I like, I like what I see It gives me such a glow Yeah, yeah, yeah Stop, look and listen, baby That's my philosophy It's called rubberneckin', baby And that's all right with... This is the exact bench where Elvis sat in Blue Hawaii. Oh, yeah. That's him. I can't believe it. My butt is in the shadow of the butt of Elvis Presley. Oh. Yes. Okay, Elvis. We're ready to receive a great idea for our hula. (ECHOING) (CLUCKS) That's it. I got it. Elvis is trying to tell us to do a hula about a chicken. (SQUAWKS) No, he's not. There's plenty of other places on the map that we can go to. We better hurry. Hey, drop it! Gotcha. (LILO STRAINS) Yes! Whoa. No. We're sunk. (WAILS) I know it's hard to keep the faith sometimes, but if you don't give up on Elvis, Elvis won't give up on you. That song. It's about the Hawaiian goddess Hi'iaka. Hey! That's right, Lilo. That's a great story. Friendship, jealousy, death by molten lava! Do you know what this means? - Thank you, Elvis! - Thank you, Elvis! We got our hula. (TYPING, COMPUTER BLEEPS) Stupid supercomputer. I know, Mom, but Jumba and I have been very busy. - My mom says hi. - Yeah, hi... He's waving. I can't talk about it, Mom. It's top secret. - I said I was sorry. - That's it. That's it! I have to go, Mom. Talk to you Sunday. I finished plans for new fusion chamber that will recharge Stitch. Way to go. But we don't have alien technology to build it. Way to burst a bubble. We'll have to find primitive Earth machinery and just hope it works. No prob. I can get all those parts from the house. - (ALARM) - JUMBA: Agh! Stitch is having another episode. They're getting worse. Hurry. These parts are crucial to saving Stitch's life. Nothing can go wrong. Target sighted. Gotcha. Oh, no, it's you. I mean, hi, Nani. - What are you doing with the toaster? - This? Yeah, interesting question. - What's going on? - I was just about to... We have to hurry to... Nani... - To make toast. - Toast? Making toast. We're making toast. Toast. Who doesn't enjoy nice, crispy piece of toast? Answer, nobody. And there's so many different kinds. Rye, sourdough, pumpernickel. You can put marmalade on it. Tasty toast. You don't know what you're missing. - Care to try some? - That's okay. I've gotta go to work. - Oh, and, boys? - Hmm? Don't play with the toaster. (GASPS) Hi, David. Gotta run. If you're hungry, we've got toast. Lots of toast. - Should I make more? - Just get rid of him. - But how? - You're the Earth expert. (SIGHS) Hmm. David, David, David. Poor, sweet David. Trusting, naive David. - Okay, maybe I do need help. - You're in good hands. For 29.95, you can have the kayak all day long. But, of course... Look at her. Tsk. Tsk. - Doesn't even know you're here. - Maybe because we're hiding. Oh, I'm sorry. Is my relationship dying? No. Okay, okay. What you think I should do? Well, it's obvious she's taking you for granted. But she won't if she sees another woman interested. - What other woman? - Whoo-hoo! - Yeah! - Have fun. Oh, my, you're so fascinating and tan. Whoa! I'm so clumsy. You've gotta be kidding me. - I don't think... - It's working. She's coming over. - Hey, Nani. - No waving. Be cool. Is that a deltoid or a rhomboid? (GIGGLING) Okay. Hey, David, I'm off at 5:00. Wanna get some dinner? - Great. - He has plans. - He does? - With me. I'm the new girl on the island. Let me get this straight. You came here and interrupted me to tell me you have pretend plans with Pleakley? I, uh, don't know what you're talking about. My name is Inga. I'm a foreign exchange student. Are you jealous? Mmm... No. Well, you blew it. Aha! (BOTH LAUGH) LILO: This is how the story goes, Stitch. Once, there was a beautiful goddess named Hi'iaka and a handsome mortal named Lohi'au. They were as close as two people could be. Oops! But one day, Pele, the volcano goddess, grew jealous of their friendship. So she took Lohi'au and threw him into a volcano filled with molten lava. - Waagh! - Oh... Stitch! My bad. Hi'iaka discovered his body in a cavern by a sea cliff, and she stayed with him, praying to the gods to bring Lohi'au's spirit back. And it worked. Her love brought him back to life, proving that love is more powerful than death. MAN: I will love you always We are ready for rehearsal. KUMU: Okay, girls, this is your last rehearsal before tomorrow's competition. What if I forget the moves and Mertle laughs at me? And I get mad and pound her? You gotta help me, Stitch. I need you. We do together. Our hula is about an ancient friendship that proves love is more powerful than death. Oh, brother. The great goddess Hi'iaka... That's me! And the brave and handsome mortal Lohi'au. That's Stitch. I said, the handsome mortal Lohi'au! Oh, handsome mortal! Stink-o-rama. Stitch, get out here. (RUMBLING) (GROWLS) - What are you doing? - (GIRLS LAUGH) Cut it out. That's not what we practiced. Stitch! No! - LILO: Stop it! - He's crazy! (GIRLS SCREAM) Girls, girls, get behind me. Lilo, get control of your dog. Nice doggy... Lilo! Lilo! (SCREAMS) Lilo, you will not be allowed to rehearse at this halau again. Lilo, I... I... NANI: Come on. It couldn't have been that bad. It was. Mahalo. Have a good one. - You're not listening to me. - I'm listening. I have to work. My hula career is falling to pieces, and you're worried about stinking work? Stitch needs you to be patient with him. - He did it on purpose. - You don't mean that. You should have seen the way he was acting. - Aren't you being overdramatic? - His goodness level is at rock bottom. (ELVIS PRESLEY: I NEED YOUR LOVE TONIGHT) (TIRES SCREECHING) Oh, oh, I love you so Uh, uh, I can't let you go Ooh, ooh, don't tell me no I need your love tonight Oh, gee, the way you kiss Sweedee, too good to miss Wowee, I want more of this I need your love tonight I've been waiting just for tonight To do some lovin' and hold you tight Don't tell me, baby, you gotta go I got the hi-fi high and the lights down low Hey, now, hear what I say Oh, wow, you better stay Pow, pow, don't run away I need your love tonight (WHISTLING) I need your love tonight Oh, oh, I love you so Uh, uh, I can't let you go Ooh, ooh, don't tell me no I need your love tonight Oh, gee, the way you kiss Sweedee, too good to miss Wowee, I want more of this I need your love tonight (HUMS I NEED YOUR LOVE TONIGHT) Oh, yeah. The great goddess Hi'iaka... That's me. And the brave mortal Lohi'au... Whoa. That's also me. Whoa. Were best friends. Lilo, look. - Their friendship proved... - I'm good now. No more badness. Oh, sorry. (SIGHS) - The great goddess Hi'iaka... - Stitch good. Stitch, just get outta here. Fuzzball. - No, you out. - No, you. - You. You! - You. You! Fine. I will. - No, Stitch will. - I'm leaving first. - I'm leaving first! I am. - No! Stitch first! Who took my hair... Who took my hair dryer? Get back here. You'll be sorry. - Open this door, trog. - Who's there? - Stitch. Open the door. - Okay. What is up with you two? - Nani, it's me. - Neither of you move. (BOTH GROWL) Oh, David, I'm glad you're here... David? Nani, you're not the only fish in the sea. - PLEAKLEY: Tell her you have... - Because I have a lot of... uh... - Tell her your options. - Options? Options. Oh, really? PLEAKLEY: Ol! (HUMS TUNELESSLY) Are you jealous? Ai-ya. - She's touching me. - I'm not touching you. - You're touching me! - Not touching. - Touching me! - It's free air. - Ew! - Would you cut it out? This is crazy. You guys are family. Ohana... Ow! - Why are you fighting? - Because he ruins everything. - Not my fault. - Then whose fault is it? - You're dead meat. - Whoa! That is it! Go to your room and make up like loving friends! - You're gross. - Stupid head. Keep walking. (STITCH MUTTERS) Stitch sorry. We said we were gonna be good. I needed you, Stitch. Stitch good again. If you promise to be good, I'll give you one more chance. - But I want you to promise. - Oh, yeah. (ALIEN LANGUAGE) You get the costumes, and I'll get the record player. Stitch good. Good, good, good, good, good. Stitch good... (WHIMPERS, GROWLS) (FIZZING) We are ready. - Stitch. - Lilo. - Everything's ruined. - I... I sorry. I don't know why I ever believed you. Something wrong with Stitch. I know what's wrong with you. You're bad, and you'll always be bad. Three. Two. One. Ta-da! There it is, Pleakley. The fusion chamber, the only thing that can save Stitch. - It's amazing. - Just another work of genius. Oh, oh, can I switch it on? Please, please? Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no. That is extremely delicate machine. It takes superior mind. (HUMMING) Heh, thanks to me, crisis is over. Oh! Jumba? Jumba? What happened? (METAL SCRAPING) That's it, Pleakley. It's over. I can't build a new fusion chamber. Sure you can, like you built the first one. I didn't build first one. I ordered it from catalogue. A catalogue? And now there is no hope for my little creation. Jumba has failed family. So you didn't build the first fusion chamber. So what? You still built Stitch, didn't ya? Well, didn't ya? Yes. And you're still an evil genius. Admit it. No, I... I don't like to brag. Well, see, that's why you're the only one who can do it. (COMPUTER BLEEPS) Pleakley, my wrench! Lilo? Hey, Lilo. I'm not doing the hula with him. So don't try to make me. Okay, okay. He's ruining my chance of winning. Lilo, baby, it's just a contest. - No, it's not. Now get off my bed. - Not until we talk about this. You're no help! I wish Mom were here. - I'm doing the best I can. - Well, it's not good enough. Don't you think I know that? BOTH: Oh... NANI: Hey. Remember how she would always make up those funny constellations? Like Swiss Cheese Man? Where is the Stinky Bag of Garbage again? NANI: Near the Sour Milky Way. Right, near the Old Lady... BOTH: With the Chihuahua on her Head. I have to win the contest, just like Mom did. If I win, she'll know I'm good, and she'll be proud of me. Oh, baby. You don't have to win anything for Mom to be proud of you. - How do you know? - Because I know everything. Okay, I don't know everything, but I think Mom would be proud of you just for being you. You, too. Thanks, Lilo. (WHIMPERS) Stitch good. Stitch good now. (ELVIS WITH JXL: A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION) (LOUD GULPING) (BELCHING) A little less conversation a little more action, please All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me A little more bite and a little less bark A little less fight and a little more spark Close your mouth and open up your heart and, baby, satisfy me Satisfy me, baby Do you think Lilo will show up? MERTLE: After that rehearsal? She wouldn't dare. - Come on, come on - Come on, come on Don't procrastinate, don't articulate Girl, it's getting late gettin' upset waitin' around A little less conversation a little more action, please A little more bite and a little less bark A little less fight and a little more spark Close your mouth and open up your heart and, baby, satisfy me - Satisfy me - Satisfy me I just wanted to say I am very proud of all your hard work. If it were up to me, you would all win first place. He's just saying that so the losers don't feel bad. Hi, Nani. Uh, yeah. Okay. (TRUMPETING) Welcome to our annual May Day Festival, where one of our little girls will be chosen alaka'i. First up is Aleka, doing the dance of the pineapple. (APPLAUSE) (STRAINING) Ah, that should do it. What if it doesn't work? It will. Ooh, maika'i, Aleka. Next up is Mertle Edmonds. It's a gift certificate to my daddy's store. Hit it. Legend tells of a man named Karl who dreamt of offering authentic Hawaiian collectibles at an affordable price. Like this costume in seven natural colors, and these genuine faux pearls, each a jewel of the Pacific. The best things in life are marked down for clearance this weekend at Karl's. Mertle, what can I say? Thank you. It's in the bag. If Jumba and Pleakley don't get here soon, they're gonna miss Lilo. No. - What's happening? - His circuits are about to blow. We have to get him in the fusion chamber now! - Shouldn't we test it? - There isn't time. Next we have Lilo, who's doing her hula about an ancient friendship. This is it. - You'll be great. - Stitch? I just want to say I... I can't talk now. I have to go on. I know, I... - Oh, no, badness coming on. - What? - I... I have to... - Are you okay? Stitch! No. - Stitch? - No, Lilo. Too dangerous. - Stitch? - Lilo, it's your turn. Everybody's waiting. My hula is about an ancient friendship that proves love is more powerful than death. (SINGING IN HAWAIIAN) I will love you, I will love you I'm sorry, Mom. Stitch! Come back! - Have you seen Stitch? - We thought he was with you. - Lilo, baby, what happened? - Something's wrong with Stitch. He's malfunctioning. And if we don't find him soon... Stitch! Stitch? - Oh, Stitch! Where are you? - Stitch. You there, brudda, brudda? Stitch! No! Hey, we'll find him. - We looked everywhere. - He only has few minutes left. - The ship. - The fusion chamber. Stitch! Stitch. - We have to stop him. - (CAR HORN BEEPS) Whoo! - I think I should drive. - Two eyes. My car. I'm driving. At the rate he is going, he's soon to be accelerating into stratosphere. If only we had way to communicate with him. Stitch has taken off in the ship, and we have no way to contact him. - Poor Jumba. He's worked so hard. - Give me that! Yes, yes... Yes, Mother Pleakley. He'll call you back. Hello. Thanks for using the Uninhabited Planet Index, your guide to the galaxy's most isolated and lonely locations. If your selection is Planet Z-13, engage hyper-drive.
