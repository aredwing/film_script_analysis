Oh! Billy, you know what? I am saying stop. This is your room, come on. - I don't like it. - Why not? Smell the walls. Mm... yeah. You know what? They just need a fresh coat of paint. You can pick the color. - Black. - Black? Cozy. I don't wanna go to school, Mom. I'm gonna be the new kid. It's the worst thing ever. How will I even know where to go? We'll figure it out. We? No. No mothers. I want to meet your teacher Mrs. Bommley. No, no mothers. And I want to see your classroom and just make sure that everything's okay. No mothers. And also, Mom, don't put anything in my lunch like a little note saying, "Good luck, Billy." Don't worry, I won't. Okay, unpack, all right? You're gonna feel so much better once you get settled in and get all your toys out. Toys? Material possessions. Joe, Joe, look! There's a new kid and he's riding his bike on the sidewalk. - Look! Boiler Head! - Dismount, young man. "And walk your bicycle. Walk your bicycle." Everybody, stare at him. Billy F, is that where you're putting your bike? - It's a bike rack. - It's a bike rack. - Billy F? - Yeah, Billy F. Billy F. See you around, new kid. Mrs. Bommley and Isaac... No! No, wait! Aw, you stupid note. Say you were lost. I'm not lost. Say you were though. Okay, say I was. Follow me. Sorry, I'm so tall. - Erk, Erk, Erk! - Incoming! - Incoming - Coming in. - Erk, Erk. - Erk, Erk Erk, Erk! Put your stuff in there, and that's our classroom in there. - Erk, Erk. - Everyone calls that girl Erk. - Erk? - Erika. No hats allowed. Uh, please don't make me go in there. Ow! Oh! Come, young man. Sweet. Class, you have a new student joining you today. Everyone, let's welcome Billy with a warm hello. - Class? - Hello, Billy. You're late. Get to your seats. Would you write your name on the board, young man? Billy Forrester, with two Rs. - Three. - I beg your pardon? There's three Rs. Thank you, Mr. Burdock. Welcome, Billy. As part of our curriculum, we are studying Ancient Egypt. Oh! Thus the Sphinx, thus the pyramids, thus the bust of Nefertiti. Now, would you like to sit, Billy? Let's see, let's find you a seat. How about right there, in back of Erika? Erk, Erk. Tomorrow, make sure you put your backpack in the cubby, and welcome! Erk, Erk. - Erk. - Erk, Erk, Erk. Hey, have a delicious lunch. Woo-hoo! Hey! Hey, Billy F. That's your lunch, huh? You eat worms? I eat them all the time. You want to try one? Here you go. Somebody get this off of me! He's gonna get it now. Everyone sit! Boiler Head. - He's gonna get it. - Look at that. I'm popular! Woody, tell Billy and Daddy what you did today. The pre-school kids are called sea turtles - and when they introduced Woody... - I sang a song! He did. He stood right up when they introduced him and he sang his little heart out, didn't you? Oh, yeah? What song did you sing, Woody? ~ Baby beluga in the deep blue sea ~ ~ Swims so wild and swims so free ~ ~ Heaven above, sea below ~ ~ And the little white whale on the go... ~ Stop! No more! He's just singing, Billy. He's not just singing. He's deliberately not stopping! ~ The waves roll in ~ ~ The waves roll out... ~ ~ See the water squirting out of my spout. ~ - Dad? - Billy, hey. Couldn't tell if you were asleep. My brain's keeping me awake. What's the headline in that brain of yours? I don't like my school. Yeah, well, Billy, first days are tough. First days can be really hard. You should have seen me at work today. You know, I, uh, I couldn't keep anyone's name straight. Thanks, I'll be right with you, Bob. It's Rob, Rob Simon. And then they made me wear a name tag. This is your IMB badge. You're gonna need this when you go over to VOD because they're gonna ask for it for IOC. Anything like that happen to you? Not really. Did you make any friends? Everybody is already friends. They all went to kindergarten probably. And I'm just this kid who's just there all of a sudden. Well, you know what you do? You go up to people, you take the initiative, you say, - "Hi, I'm Billy Forrester." - Say my last name? My point is, you don't wait for them to come to you, okay? You go up to them, introduce yourself, shake hands. Kids don't shake hands, Dad. Try and get some sleep. You know, things are gonna get better, I promise. You watch, tomorrow you're gonna have a great day. Wormboy! Wormboy! - Wormboy! Wormboy! - Stop! - Wormboy! - Get away! - Wormboy! Wormboy! - Get off! Wormboy! Stop! Get off! We're just calling you Wormboy 'cause that's what you said. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. You said, "I eat worms." Right? Right? - Yeah! - Yeah! So, you're Wormboy. Wormboy. We'll get back with you at recess. Oh, hey. Hey, does your house have a front door that's green? I was trying to figure out where you live 'cause my house has a red door with a sign that says Tansey. That's my name, Erika Tansey. You're making it worse. I'm Adam Simms. I used to be friends with Frasier Boone. You know Frasier Boone? I don't know anybody, okay? That's like me. No friends. I have lots of friends. They just don't go to this dumb school. Hey, you know how you threw a worm at Joe Guire and hit him in the face? What about it? I thought for sure he was gonna smash you with the death ring. The death ring? Joe has a ring called the death ring. If he punches you with it, you die. But you don't die now. You die in eighth grade, so nobody can prove it. It's got poison in it that goes into your skin and makes an ulcer. Very slowly you bleed to death. If he punches you with it? He punched me. And in the eight grade... I'm gonna be dead. What did you do to make him punch you in the first place? Nothing. He just said I was annoying him for some reason. Uh, how hard did he punch you? Really really hard. Like this... And then I fell down like this. And it made a mark right here where the poison went in. Ugh! Ugh! Wormboy! Wormboy! Wormboy! Wormboy! Wormboy! Wormboy! Wormboy! Wormboy! Wormboy! Wormboy! You guys are stupid! You can say Wormboy all you want. I don't care! Worms don't even taste hardly. I had a whole bowl for breakfast with brown sugar and cold milk. That's a lie. Sometimes I boil them. Sometimes I do them on the barbecue. My favorite way, fried like French fries. The greasier and the slimier the better. Wormboy, you couldn't even eat one worm. Right when it touched your tongue you'd puke. - You want to bet? - The smell would make you puke. You couldn't even eat a quarter of a worm. I can eat this many worms, Joe. 10 easy! And you would be the one who'd puke just watching me. Let's bet. That I would eat 10 worms? Yeah, and when you throw up you lose. - Yeah. - What if I don't lose? - What's the bet, you mean? - I know. The loser has to come to school with worms in his pants. Yeah, and he has to walk down the hall past everybody. All right. It's gonna be you Wormboy. But Joe, what if he eats a tiny bit of worm, and then a year later a tiny bit more of a worm... No, you gotta eat all 10 worms, all on the same day. - And I get to pick them. - When? This Saturday. That's the day after tomorrow. I need more time to get ready. Backing out? Come on, Wormboy, shake on it. Kids don't shake hands. I said, shake on it! It's a bet. Oh! - Hey, Mitch. - Hey. - I had a thought. You play tennis? - Yup. - How about Helen? - Yeah. Yeah we both play tennis. You gotta come down to our club. We'll play some doubles. That's be great, Rob. Great. You and I, we played tennis when we first met a couple of times. - You were good. - Yeah, compared to you I was. It's not that he asked me. It's the way he asked me. Like he was testing me. Why are you looking at that? Joe Guire told me to. "Find out about worms," he said. That's what they look like inside? Yeah. They have brains. No eyes. They're blind. And look, five hearts. And look at this interesting detail. - Sphincter. - That's the worm's butt. - Sphincter. - Sphincter. - Sphincter. - Sphincter sphincter sphincter! Stop, you guys! I have to eat one. I have to eat 10. - Sphincter. - Sphincter. - Sphincter. Sphincter. - Sphincter. Sphincter. - Sphincter. - Boys... "How the Ancient Egyptians Preserved their Dead." Fascinating topic, boys. Fascinating. The mystery of the Sphinx. Excellent, excellent. And on your recess too. Oh, you're to be commended. Carry on. - Oh, that was close. - Yeah. Excellent, excellent, boys! Fascinating. And on your recess too! The lost sphincter of the Sphinx. The lost sphincter of the Sphinx. The lost sphinc... You guys are friends with this guy, who's gonna be barfing his guts out tomorrow? Donny, get over here. You're not his friend. He's Wormboy. He doesn't have any friends. - Bradley. - Right here, Joe. Tell him the new rule. All 10 worms must be eaten by 7:00 P.M. Or you lose. And Bradley is the official timekeeper. Why do you make all the rules? Because... he just does. You won't even make it to 7:00. 'Cause we're making the worms taste bad. Like they already don't? Yeah, shut up, Twitch! You too, Techno Mouth. Benjy... Benjy is the official worm cook. You're gonna cook the worms? I'm thinking up some disgusting recipes. You're the one that said you like them fried, Wormboy. We're making the worms taste nasty. I see you, so quit hiding. Just on my way home and I thought you might want to know I might be leaving this place. - Is your family moving again? - No. Just me. Is this all because you threw a worm in Joe Guire's face? That was really dumb! Really dumb, wasn't it? I loved it. - You loved it? - Yup, I loved it. Whoa, you're good. Thank you. - Say I knew. - Knew what? - About the bet. - You can't know, you're a girl. Say I did though. Say I also know you've never eaten a worm in your whole life. - How would you know that? - Because... why would you? Did you know it was tomorrow? And can I tell you something? What? I have a really weak stomach. Really weak. There are a lot of foods I can't eat. Then why'd you make the stupid bet in the first place? I don't know. I was just trying to go to school and be a normal person. Normal people don't eat worms, Billy. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, what do you think? I'm naked. All right, come on, we're going out. - Where? - Woody's school. They're doing a performance and Woody's in it. We're meeting your dad there. Come on, I need you to put on a clean shirt. What? Up swim the sea turtles, up through the ocean waves. And then down, down swim the sea turtles, dancing on the ocean waves. Focus, sea turtles. Focus. Focus, sweetie. ~ Sea turtles ~ ~ And the beluga in the deep blue sea. ~ - No, not... come here. - Yeah! Focus! Focus! I am the greatest. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Billy! Hey, what are you doing out here? They got cake inside. I don't care. I don't want any cake. Don't want... don't want any cake? Whose son are you? He's just a showoff, Dad. And everybody says, "Oh, he's so cute" just because he's little. I hate him. - You don't hate your brother. - Yes, I do! And I hate this town we have to live in. And the kids at my school, - they're all... - They're just kids, Billy. They're just kids. Kids are the same everywhere you go. No. No, they aren't. These kids are different. Different how? Nothing. Billy, your, uh, your mother and I, we, uh, met this woman inside. She has a son, Benjy, he's in your class. You know a Benjy? I don't know anybody. Well, she says... she says they're all playing soccer this afternoon. - Soccer? - Soccer, right. At the field by the creek. I'll get directions from her, okay? No, they didn't ask me. Billy, come on, when they see how good you are, they'll be begging you to play. Mm, I don't have my cleats. We'll go home and get them. Come on, now you're just making excuses. You know, you'll go, you'll have fun. Look here, have some cake. It's really... stale. - What kind is it? - Chocolate-covered stale cake. I can't find any. They're all over here, come on. Whoa, look at this one! - He's a find. - Let me see it. Hey, you gotta show that one to Joe. He's really gonna puke, huh, Joe? Yup, he's gonna spew his guts. What if he doesn't? What was that, Adam? Huh? Well, um... worms could just be like meat really. You know, think of the first person who said, "I'm gonna eat a chicken." Then he ate it and it was just a chicken. Then we have to find out. Someone get a worm. - Come here. - Me? Don't spit it out. Chew it. Chew, Adam. My God! Whoa! Perfect. You see, that was one worm. Wormboy has to eat 10. Joe has a ring called the death ring. If he punches you with it you die. But you don't die now. You die in the eighth grade, so nobody can prove it. It's got poison in it that goes into your skin and makes an ulcer. Very slowly, you bleed to death. Death. I'm running away. Ow! I can't run away. Where will I go? I've got to do it. If we don't fight the evil forces, they'll destroy our planet. Beat the evil forces! Billy, I need to talk to you. Billy, I want you to look after Woody today, all right? Don't let him get in any trouble. - Woody? - Yeah, Woody. Make sure he gets lunch, all right? We'll be back for supper. No, Dad, no! Billy, you don't have a choice in the matter, okay? I need to be fo... focused today, okay? So do I! I need to be focused. No, you don't need to be focused. It's Saturday. You get to do whatever you want. Just include your brother. Okay, listen, Wood, you're little, okay? So you don't even know anything, okay? So today, for the whole day you have to obey me. You know what that means? Be your slave? Well, yeah, kind of. What are you doing? Trying to drool on those ants. Ugh! Listen to me, Wood. You know how we moved here and how everything is different? Like our house and your school. Well, it's the same thing with me. I'm not the same brother you had before. I'm a whole other person. And everything you remember about your old brother, all isn't true about your new brother. For instance, I've never been sick. - I've seen you sick. - Woody. You threw up at Raging Waters and they had to drain the whole pool. That wasn't me! Don't you get it? And don't pick your nose! What, you're gonna pick your nose all day? You're hurting my bike! I'm not hurting your bike. I can't hurt a person's bike. Well, you're shaking it and it's hitting my dilly-dink. Don't say stuff like that. My dilly-dink is my penis. I'm gonna eat the worms. Okay. And, um... what are you doing today? Why? I have to babysit my little brother. Where is he? Get this stuff off me! - Joey the Joke. - Give me it, Nigel. - Heard a story about you today, Joke. - What story? - Something about a worm. - The bet, you mean? You tell me, Joke. Well, this new kid at our school, I-I'm making him eat 10 worms and... Same guy who threw a worm in your face? - Who told you that? - Your dumb friend, Plug. Plug told you? Actually he told his sister and she told me. Said the whole school was laughing and that you were afraid. Were you afraid, Joke, of a little worm? I wasn't afraid. Joke. Joke. You're a joke. Get out of here, crows! Get out of my kitchen! Look what happens when you put them on a gummy worm. Whoa, look at them. They're having a spasmodic convulsion. Hey guys, here comes Joe. - Plug. - Yeah. Come here. - What did I do? - Ask your sister. Benjy, how are you gonna cook them? - With this stuff. - What is it? - Lard. - Is that like butter? Lard's from a pig. It's the fat. Pig fat. Make sure you tell Wormboy that. Yeah, look at it. 10 seems like so many. Why did you make it 10? Because I said I could eat 10. But I didn't mean it. And Joe said, "You said..." I couldn't back out because I did say it, you know what I mean? Not really. Hey, Joe, there he is. Hey, Wormboy, that's your team, huh? You and her, and who's that little kid? He's got training wheels. Hey, Wormboy! Wormboy? Let me give you another person. You know, help you out. Make things fair. Adam, go. Wormboy! You're gonna see stuff today, Woody, and it's just normal stuff that big kids do. And big kids never tell their parents. - Do you understand? - Billy, I have to go poo. Oh, Jeez. I can't help it, it's making me. - What is? - Everything. Woody, come with me. Billy, go. All right, let's go. Pig fat was not part of the bet. You're the one that said you liked them fried, Wormboy. "The greasier, the slimier the better," you said. Worm number one: "Le Big Porker." What are you talking like that for? I'm French. Go on, Wormboy. Eat it. Bon appetit. Yuck, worm juice! It squirted right on me. Go on, Wormboy, eat it before all the guts run out. He did it. Oh, gross! Ugh! Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew. I don't like where I'm sitting. Look out, you guys! I think he's gonna puke already. Where's the worm? - Let's see. - I don't think it's sanitary. You have to swallow it, Wormboy, all of it. There's chunks in there he hasn't even chewed yet. Swallow! Swallow! Swallow! Swallow! Swallow! Swallow! Swallow! Hey kids, no fires in the park without adult supervision! Want to make a wish, Woody? Here's what you do. Take a little stone and go like this, ~ I wish I had a horse ~ ~ That I could ride ride ride. ~ Here, now you try. ~ I wish my brother was dead dead dead. ~ Swallow! Swallow! Swallow! Swallow! Hey, make sure he doesn't spit it out! Swallow! Swallow! Swallow! Swallow! Billy! Ugh! Swallow! Swallow! Swallow! Hey, you guys! He ate it, Joe, look. Yeah, I see him Benjy. So what are we gonna do now? We got no place to cook them. Come on, you guys, we need somebody's kitchen. - My family is vegetarian. - No way. Hey, I know, Adam Simms. His uncle owns The Brown Toad. My uncle hates me. You boys know what you want? You're taking up the whole counter there. - Uh, we're still deciding, sir. - Yeah. Adam! - Oh, hi, Uncle Ed. - What's this? I was just, um, giving you a hand in here. Last time you gave me a hand you nearly chopped your thumb off. Yuck! Here, just wear this. Don't muck up the works. Adam! Faster! Cook faster. Oh, no. Ugh! Hey hey hey! You're gonna burn down my restaurant! - But Uncle Ed... - Stay back! Stay back! There you go. Omelet up. Ding ding. Boiler Head. - Come on. - Let's go. Hello, boys. Come on over here. Come on. You boys up to something? You look a little mischievous. Do you know, that I used to come to The Brown Toad when I was a kid? Yeah. Oh, root beer float and a bacon burger... by golly, I was in heaven. Alley-oop. Mm. Mm mm mm. Mm, that's a good omelet. He ate the whole worm! The principal of our school! "When I was a boy I ate root beer floats, by golly!" Why did he say alley-oop? - Yeah. - Maybe he's nuts. Yeah! I am Boiler Head. Alley-oop! Alley-oop, alley-oop, Alley-oop, alley-oop. - Donny! - Alley-oop, alley-oop... I'm sorry. We're just laughing, Joe. I wasn't asking you, Wormboy. Adam! What's this box of bugs doing in my restaurant? You're gonna have the health department on my case. Get out of here! All of you! Punks! Don't worry, you guys. I cooked the worm. I seriously cooked it. I cooked two worms at once. See, two of them. Oh, cool. How did you make it so lumpy? I dunked it in the French fry fryer and then smeared liver juice all over it. Liver juice? I was trying to cover the worm taste. Hey, you guys, I should name it. How about "The Greasy Brown Toad Bloater Special"? Plug! What's the matter, not French enough for you? All right, go on, Wormboy. Eat it. Ew! Ugh! Why are they guarding him, Adam? In case he throws up. 'Cause what if he wanted to cheat? He could throw up and never tell. So Joe made Plug and Bradley the official puke watchers. Adam, are you positive Twitch is okay with this? Sure. No! Please! They're gonna kill... - Tomato paste. - And put this cheese in. Smell it. It smells like a person's armpit. You guys! You can't just steal everything. - Are we allowed to eat a pickle? - No. Your dog is walking sideways, Twitch. No no, she has arthritis. Oh, my eyes are burning. - No! - What all's in there? Louisiana Hot Sauce sauce. So hot it'll blow a person's head off. Bam bam bam! No! No! It's ready. The "Burning Fireball." All right, I'll go get him. No! Ah! Man. Hey, guys, bring him in. No! I'm not ready yet. I gotta go watch, 'cause this one's gonna be ugly. Wait for me, you guys! Erika, watch me! Boys are so weird. He can't even stand the smell. Hot hot hot hot! It's burning! Come on, Wormboy, eat the whole thing. Sick. He's gonna blow! It's over! It's all over. Everyone just stand back. Stand back, you guys. - Just open your mouth, Wormboy. - Water! No water! It's a new rule. No more cooking in my house! The door is locked! And... and... and I quit your team, Joe! Who cares if you quit? All you are is Twitch, you little loser. Anybody else? Huh? Want to go on Wormboy's team? Yeah! Me. Me too, Joe! You're already on his team, Adam. Yeah, but you made me be. But now I want to. That's different - Here you go, Billy. - Ahh! - Turn it off, Adam! - Turn it off! - Turn it off! - I'm trying. Here, come on. Look, Benjy, you got to do better, okay? - I practically poisoned him. - Then why didn't it work? Wormboy stopped himself with mental powers. - What? - His mind told his vomit to stay inside of his stomach. That's impossible. Yeah, puke has a mind of its own. You almost took my head off, Adam. Here you go. Don't... - I'm okay. - Hy-ah! - I got it! Oh! - Hoo-ah! Oh! Okay, this... - this is not going well. - Where are you going? - This is... this is bad. - What? - We're terrible. We're terrible. - What? I got bad shorts. People are staring at us. This is bad. Oh, that's him. Look alive, here they come. Here they come. That's the guy you're afraid of? Huh. ~ I'm not the kind of guy ~ ~ Who gives up just like that... ~ ~ Oh no oh oh ~ - ~ The tide is high... ~ - Yup yup. ~ But I'm holding on... ~ - Ow! - Honey! We're a team, right? - And we're gonna beat Joe Guire. - Yeah! And we're gonna make him come to school with worms in his pants. - Yeah! - And when he does... He's gonna punch us all with the death ring and we're all gonna die like Adam Simms. Hey, but that's not till the eighth grade, right? Where is Adam? - Adam? - Oh, oh, oh. Come on, man, go go! Keep on going! - No no no. - Yeah, keep going! - Come on! - Come on! Let's go! Whoo! Get down. Faster! - Faster! - Faster! Faster! Whoo! Whoo! - Look out, Billy! - Billy! Hey, what's going on back there? - Game over! - Let's get out of here! - Run run! - Let's go! Let's go! Get out! Get out of my store. Are you ready? ~ One little bird fell out of the nest ~ ~ When the cat ate him up ~ - ~ His mama said it's for the best. ~ - Two bird. ~ Two little bird flapped his wings and flew ~ ~ He met an aeroplane and said, boom ~ - ~ How do you do? ~ - It's Erika. Hey, you guys! Hey, you guys! - It's Erk. - Stop! Joe, stop! You're touching my bike. Yeah yeah. Is the bet over? You're a girl, you don't know about the bet. - Where's Billy? - Erk, let go! Look, we're going to Plug's house, okay? His dad's got a blowtorch. Tell me where Billy is. We can't keep up with you guys. Who asked you to? I'm looking after Billy's brother. So that's who that kid is? He's Wormboy's little brother? Don't talk to him, Woody. Do you wanna know where Billy is or don't you? Hey, Woody. Have you ever seen your brother throw up? He doesn't know what you're talking about, Joe. Sure he does. Yeah, he got sick from chicken pox, too much Halloween, and putting tooth paste on a light bulb. And he got sick at the zoo from watching a pig lick itself! What else did he get sick from? Car sick. Oh, yeah? Mo-wo-wotion sickness. Thanks, you little midget. What happened to the blowtorch, Plug? My dad just laughed at me. Ha ha ha. Magni-fried. What's all this? Crushed up marshmallow, dash of ketchup and tuna fish from a can. I call it the "Marsh Mallieu." How about "Barf Mallieu"? "Barf-mellow." Thanks, Adam. Oops. Sorry, Billy. The worm, the sauce. Oh! ~ Alley-oopa, gentille alley-oopa. ~ I can do this. Whoo! Oh, yeah, I'm Wormboy! Stomach of steel! Ooo! I ate the whole Barfmel... whoa! Oh! Oops. Are you okay, Billy? - Billy, are you okay? - "Billy, are you okay?" Erk! Erk! - Billy! - Billy, are you okay? - Oh, Billy. - Poor thing. Get away, Erika. You big giant. Oh! - Oh, that hurts. - Erk! Go on, Erika. - You big giant! - Erk! - Aw! Bye! - Have a nice day. Give him another one, Benjy. Peanut butter and worm jam sandwich. Billy the Great. Woody! Mommy! Mommy! - Oh my God! Oh, okay, um... - Shoot! Chew! Come here! Come here, baby! Chew it! - Billy! - Swallow. Hey, there you are. When are you coming home for supper? Supper? Yeah, supper. You gonna introduce me, Billy? How are you doing, guys? I'm Billy's father. - How are you doing, Mr. Forrester? - Hey! - Joe Guire. - Joe Guire, nice to meet you. You see that, Billy? Kids do shake hands. What have you guys been up to all day, boys? - Playing, you know. - Playing, yeah. - And having fun. - Yeah. Great, great. You know, it's suppertime, sir, and we all have to go home and have a nice big supper. Don't we, Billy? Right you are, Joe. Tell you what, Billy, we're gonna take the Woodster with us. He looks a little tired. And we'll see you at home. Bye, Mr. Forrester. - What time is it, Bradley? - 5:03, Joe. This is perfect. Gotta go home and gobble down your supper. Don't even think about puking, 'cause you never know who's watching. Bye. Three whole worms to go. See, the trick with chopsticks is to pinch them like so. And then it's all in the wrist. What's the matter, honey? Aren't you hungry? Of course he's hungry. Out riding bikes around all day. How many games did we play today, Helen? One, but it went on forever. - Mommy? - Yes, sweetie. What is it, honey? Oh. - Oh, hey, Wood. - Poor thing. - Woody, come on. - Oh, honey. - I'll give him a bath. - Okay. I got you, oh, baby. Aw, little guy. He's tuckered out, that little duffer. Looks like you ran him ragged, didn't you? - Dad! - Yeah. It's getting late and they're all going out again. And... and... What's going on? I've been eating worms all day. What? Well, I didn't want to, but then when I started I had to keep going. And it made me feel awful. It's okay. It's okay, Billy, I understand. I do. I've eaten a few worms myself this past week. - You have? - Yeah. I'm the new guy too, remember? Trying to fit in. Trying to please others. A worm here and a worm there, I know what that tastes like. You're not talking about real worms, are you, Dad? I'm talking about adjusting to a new situation. You know, I saw all those boys today. It's a lot of boys to meet all at once too, isn't it? Yeah, well, they're not all as nice as you think they are. Careful there, Billy. You don't want to judge them too quickly. Take it from me. You... you want to give people time. I'm not hungry at all. Eat up, Billy. You don't want to go outside on an empty stomach. Move! Billy. What are you guys doing? Time's running out. And Joe wants everybody to meet him down by the river. Why the river? There's an old lady that lives down there. People say she's a witch. She sells worms to fishermen. Huge ones, long as a person's arm. Don't tell him that, Adam. I-I-I meant, long as a cat's arm. Where's Twitch? Grounded 'cause we wrecked his house, and destroyed it. I can't eat anymore worms, you guys! I'm gonna quit. You can't quit. If you quit then you lose. Then we all lose. This is our one chance not to be losers! - Woody! - ~ When the cat ate him up ~ ~ His mama said it's for the best. ~ - Where did you learn that song? - Erika. Erika. She'll know how to get me out of this stupid dumb bet. What are you thinking of her for? She's a girl! And, Billy, you called her a big fat giant, remember? - I didn't say fat. - Yeah, but still. Erika would never be mad at me. We're friends. - Rat! - No wait, you don't get it. Don't get what? That you're just turning into another Joe? - I'm not a Joe. - You were being mean like him. And you're acting like some person that you're not. I'm sorry. I wasn't being mean on purpose. You try eating worms with marshmallows and ketchup on them. Joe Guire is cruel to people, Billy, and it's all 'cause people let him. They just do what he says and he goes around making rules up. And you're the first person that ever did anything. - What did I do? - You challenged him! - Well, I wish I never did. - And so will he when this is over. Joe Guire is a bully. Make him come to school with worms in his pants and no one will ever be scared of him again. What about the death ring though? It's just a dumb old ring he wears to scare people, Billy. Win this bet and that ring will mean nothing. I've never been in there before. - Have you, Joe? - No. But my brother went in there once, he just saw fishing stuff. It was really gross and spooky inside. You think Wormboy is gonna show? If he doesn't... I win the bet. There she is. Some people call her the two-headed witch. You know why? She had two heads once, but one fell off. The one that fell off is in that bag she carries around all the time. Donny, what's that noise? It's Benjy. Benjy! Benjy! Ssh! She's not very friendly looking. I wonder what her other head looks like. Ssh. "Gone to catch me some supper." Plug, try the door. Why me? Just do it, okay? Oh, it's stinky! Oh, gross. Interesting. They've got dead fish corpses hanging from the ceiling. What do you mean, dead fish corpses? That's not funny! What are you laughing at, Bradley? Nothing. It's just that you seemed kind of... Scared! Yeah. Yeah, I'm just scared for you, Wormboy, that's all. 'Cause there's big giant night crawlers in there. From Canada, my brother said. Which means they're gigantic. We better get started then. What time is it, Bradley? You don't ask Bradley what time it is. He's on my team. Whatever you say, Joe. You make the rules. - 6:35, Joe. - Yeah, okay. Hey you guys, guess what I found? Green ones! Who's got $2? How about that for technology? It's like buying a Coke. Wait, what are these cups for? - Plug? - Yeah. If Joe loses the bet, you think he'll really walk through our school with worms in his pants? We can't let him lose the bet. We're on his team. Yeah. But sometimes I wish I wasn't on his team. Like back at The Brown Toad, when he yelled at me, I wanted to quit his team! Then why didn't you? I'm not brave, I guess. Ugh, they really are green. Green goes with green. Spinach from a can, crown of broccoli. "Viola!" You got a worm, Bradley? It just went to the bathroom on my hand. Ugh. The "Green Slusher" served in a bed of slush at room temperature. Bring it on. Ugh! You made it too thick, Benjy. Looks like wasabi. Canadian night crawlers. There's something I've always wanted to try. I'm naming this one "Radioactive Slime Delight." I wonder what he's thinking about. Perfect. There you go, Wormboy. You might need this. Who's that trespassing in my bait shop? - I'm getting out of here. - Watch out! - Come on, let's go. What are you doing? - A bet's a bet! What? What are you doing in here? Get out of here! Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of the way of the head! I think she went inside. Are you sure? I don't know. Let's go. Come on, let's get out of here! Let's go! Wait! Wait, you guys! Hey you guys, wait! Wait up! Wait up! Wait up! Wait for me. She was right there. Right there! She hit me in the head... with her head. You didn't throw up, did you? What are you doing here, Twitch? I'm on your team, Billy. One worm to go. What time is it, Bradley? - 6:52, Joe. - What's going on? They're digging for worms, Joe. Yeah, but they won't find any here anyway. We will too! Time's running out, Wormboy. - Two minutes, Joe. - We'll never make it. There aren't any worms around here anywhere. - There's got to be! - There's not, Billy! We're gonna lose. We'll never find a worm. We might as well just... - A worm! - Eat it, Billy! Come on, eat it! Make Joe come to school with worms in his pants! - No! - Move! No! That's not fair. You're a cheater. Go, Billy! Go Billy! Go! 39 seconds. Go go go go! Get it! Get it! Yeah! Billy! Billy! Billy! Billy! Billy! Billy! Billy! 10 seconds! Nine, eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... Boys are so weird! Hey, Joke. Now you really are a joke. Wha... what are you doing here, Nige? I came all the way here to see you win. Now the whole school's gonna be laughing at you. They're gonna be laughing at me too 'cause I'm your brother. Leave him alone. I think you might want to stay out of this. Leave him alone. Yeah, leave him alone. Bunch of little worms. You won. Shake on it. Kids don't shake hands. Shake. Two sock... yes, got it. Got it. - Week number two, Billy. - Yeah. Last Monday seems like a long time ago. What's the headline? Cheating. - Cheating? - Yeah. If you cheat at something and you win, and nobody knows you cheated, do you still win? The only way to win is by playing fair. But what if you didn't even know you cheated. Then would it be okay? Sounds to me like you already know the answer, Billy. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, Billy. Bye, Wormboy. See you later, Wood. - I didn't win. - Yeah, you did, Billy. You ate all 10 worms. I only ate nine. Then how come we counted 10? The 10th one was eaten by Boiler Head. The omelet. What are we gonna do? Oh! Hey, there's Joe! Oh, there he is! Look, it's Billy! What's he doing? Ew! No way! ~ Get down, get down ~ ~ Get down, get down ~ ~ Get down, get down ~ ~ Get down, get down ~ - ~ Jungle boogie... ~ - Come on. ~ Jungle boogie, get it on ~ ~ Jungle boogie, down with the boogie ~ ~ Jungle boogie, get it on ~ ~ Jungle boogie, get up with the boogie ~ ~ Jungle boogie, get up with the get down ~ ~ Jungle boogie, down with the boogie ~ ~ Jungle boogie, shake it around... ~ ~ Jungle Boogie. ~ What's going on out here?
