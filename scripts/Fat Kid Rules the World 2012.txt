I went to his house, his stepfather was there and threatened to kill me and then I immediately went back to school. For Dad. Marcus was at school. He said we have to go to a bar and would teach me how to play the drums. I went to him and really, we drank in the bar. Indeed. And what I did was stupid . That's enough. Marcus stepfather's threats? Are you okay? There was nothing bad, Dad. Trust me, I'll call Marcus and tell him to forget the whole thing , OK? I do not even play the drums, should have seen me, I ended up looking a fool. Why did you fool? Because I am a fool. I know it's difficult when you lost your mom. Look at me, son. Look at me. But you can not use that as an excuse ... School... ... Thought it would be a good idea to talk to some , so I have to set up a meeting tomorrow . Daddy please do not make me go. I will not mark them. No, it certainly will not do more.

Azengu go to the gig. It's like a concert. And you agreed to go half-past nine in the evening, without asking me, though I stand here before you? No, this is not acceptable. Call him and tell him he can not go. 're Right. I can not go, no way... I do not know who you be, I do not know where you'll be, Not for you to come home... -You're right, I can not go. No way. Because there is no way to hang out with normal people. This is so sad. What if I'm too to stop the car? -Troy! Or if there is enough space in the car everyone will ask: "Hey, who invited the fat kid?" You know what? They'll think I'll take up too much space and everyone will be mad at me. Hey guys, I'm back. -Troy, you can go to the concert. You're a smart boy and if something happens, you call me. No, Dad, I do not get it, OK? What if I go and...

Did not give up any of Marcus and does not your son. Daddy's not your fault that I became fat. I want you to know. Sisters will be back in a few hours. Marcus will be up soon, will be happy to have you here. Eat breakfast and call me if anything changes. Troy? I am proud. Most recent CD Whiskey Tango is good. Have you heard of The Marked Men?
