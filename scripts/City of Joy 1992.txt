Doctor Max fixed it. Well if you want it to heal you really ought to stop abusing yourself. Well listen to you. Are you just nuts or are you doing penance for some major past sin here? It's not penance, I love it here. You love it here? Came on a whim in the first place but then I stayed. In the beginning it was really frustrating trying to convince them not to be so. So bloody passive and then. I realised that I was fighting a thousand years of acceptance. Well maybe you should stop interfering. Maybe I should. Joan Di. Kamla, you've got to stop doing this. Happy people are fat, Joan Di. Thanks. So where do you get the bucks for this set-up? I get a bit from the Swiss organisation and my ex-husband sends Jack. He's great. Uh-huh! I'm not very good at loving just one person. Seems to work out better if I spread it around a bit. Can I ask you something? Don't you feel it's just a little bit stupid trying to drill a hole in water like this? Not nearly as stupid as asking for a hand and being turned down. Well Max. May I be so bold as to ask what you believe in? Do you believe in anything? Absolutely, lady. I believe in the Dallas Cowboys, the most oohsisteht winners of the modern era Excuse me, Mr Max. Do you saw 'flims'? Do I saw 'flims'? He's asking that do you seem 'flim' when you were small? If I saw 'flims' when I You mean movies, pictures? I saw 'flims' all the time. I saw three a week two on Saturday cartoons Donald Duck. You're great with kids, anyway. Do you know what I've come to think in my old age, Max? No idea, you're pretty much an enigma to me. I think, in life, a person really only has three choices. And I don't suppose there's any way you're not gonna tell me is there? To run to spectate or to commit. That's very tidy. Simple minded but tidy. You're awfully, badly twisted around, Well one of us sure the hell is. I'm off, Sister Joan. Ah, goodnight, god bless Doctor Sunil. Yeah. Comes from a wealthy medical family. Donates his time. Very generous spirited young man. And clearly not twisted around. Hey! No, no, I have to go home. Hello, miss. Come. Okay, bye, see you tomorrow. Manooj baba is come. Hey, hey everybody listen. Good news really good news. And what is that? Hasari has got a regular customer. And who is that person? That schoolgirl. On a monthly basis, you say? Oh yes. You must pay for the tea today. Yes, yes. Kamla, wine. The Gods have smiled Hasari has got a regular customer. A great day. It's been a lucky day. Here this is for Amrita. For her dowry. Let's start a little shelf for her. Bring me a glass of water. Yes, baba. Here. What's that, baba? Seeds. What for? So that we can watch something grow. Coming, son. God bless you. Ask him, ask him, ask him. Baba. There is a doctor from America. He sees two 'flims' and also Mickey Mouse on Saturday. Can he eat with us? Go go ask him. Come, come. Doctor Max, Doctor Max. Will you eat with us today? Sure. See this is the earth from our village. And water from our new home. When these seeds grow into flowers. We'll pluck them and put them in your hair. On your wedding day. Shambu go and get some tea. Yes, baba. And then everybody will look at you. And say oh, how beautiful she is. And I'll shed tears of joy. I was so frightened my brother gave me something to drink. I went out to piss under a tree and fell asleep. And when I woke up. I thought I married the tree. I still love that tree. If I could pay off the money lender I'd go straight back to my village. So what's a dowry, Ram? A heavy burden. Why do you bother? Well, it's our duty. An honour. Thank you, Surya. Without this our daughters can't marry. Ma! Joan Di, Joan Di. Anouar? We need a doctor. Anouar what's what's wrong? It's my wife! - It's Meeta. - Please help my sister. All right, all right, Poomina.

Hello-- tell us ...Dotor Lowe was telling us- that many of us could be helped. ...that all it would take- is money for medication. Please-- would you buy us the medication? Anouar, it, it'd cost a fortune. Well-- as we are not allowed to come to the clinic... ...then perhaps Doctor Lowe would come visiting us occasionally. Anouar, Doctor Lowe is no longer a part of this endeavour. There is only his cherished memory. ...because I am having visions. Good morning, good morning! Hell of a good morning. I may have the body of a sparrow but I have the eyes of an eagle. What are you doing, Sister Joan... ...practising medicine without a license? Oh God, junior, you're great. Oh, what a surprise! Now don't get carried away, I'm just here to get you organised. Will you shut up? What made you change your mind? Well, I had a religious experience. You see, I talked to Jesus to day...

Er, you need a truch load of broad spectrum antibiotic... ...pain killers... ...basic vaccine... God save me from knights in shining armour. Hey! Good morning, Doctor Max. - What are you doing? - Good morning, doctor. Hi, Hasari. Er, Kamla... ...I was wandering if you would like to be my assistant. At the clinic, what do you think? Hasari... ...I need Kamla as my assistant at the clinic Is it all right? You are staying here? Well-- for a bit. What do you think? Yeah. Yeah? Cool! All right. Twist and shout-- twist and shout. Come on, come on baby... Hasari, where have you been? I've been waiting almost five minutes. I'm sorry-- it was the traffic. Oh no, mum, come. Oh, you're looking very different today. Yes. You not go to school? No, we are going baara bizarre. She is getting married, Hasari. Oh-- that's very nice. Soon I'll take her children to school. Hasari, you must remember the shop where we are going. Because it is the nicest shop in the city. And when your daughter gets married-- you should, you should take her to this shop. Am I not right? Turn to the right please and don't mind her. She's just a little chatterbox. But mama, you get such beautiful saris. Come on, let's get down. Dipti dear, how do you think he can afford a shop like this? But mama, I didn't mean it. Don't take it so seriously. That was very insensitive, my dear Mama, just look at the sari. Well, youy shouldn't say these things. One you know what I mean. I said it again. One every two days, okay? Understand---great. Only four hours to go, junior. Oh, go for it! Okay, little fella, let's check you out. Let's check you out. How are you doing? How are you doing? This baby's not gaining weight. Are you giving him the extra milk we gave you? Some, not all. She's probably selling it. Selling it? Gotta pay the rent. On that dump? Well now Poomina's going to school somebody's got to pay the rent. That's the way things work round here. I'm not liking the school to be in, okay. From tomorrow I'll not go. I will go back to work... Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, yo! We have the technology. Okey dokey. This. ...Is the extra milk for the baby. And this is the extra extra milk for the rent. So it's very simple, give it to the kid or I'll kill you. Thank you, sir. And Poomina... you, young lady will stay in school. Come here little You're gonna need all the luck you can get. Gonna be a fireman when he grows up. I get no respect. Hey! Take me to 'Rifles' building. Baba... ...I'm cooking, baba. I'm cooking rice,baba. Where's your mother? Careful go get me some water. Kamla, do you have any water in there? I am fried! Hasari. Hasari, you have three fine potential scholars here. This one will be ready for a proper school in another couple of years. It's more than a father could hope. Fifteen years from now, Dallas, Texas, Doctor Manooj Pal. Thanks. Joan we can't keep going out to that leper colony, it's wasting... ...like what, two hours a day walking. I know but Well Poomina... where have you been, young lady? You should be in school! I know who this is from. It's a summons to see 'himself Now Mr Ghatak, I understand there should be an increase in rent if we have larger quaters, but I don't see why we should have to pay more protection. More people, more problems the strangers. And if I don't charge you what will I tell others? We can't afford it! If you can expand, you can afford to pay more. Excuse me, sir, this isn't a drinking den, this is a free clinic. You are from a rich country, doctor. For you money is a piece of paper with which you buy something you want. For me it's a wall. A beautiful wall. A protective wall. A wall that separates me from the degradation oh the other side. This wall is my achievement, Miss Bethel. I am proud of it. And what you don't understand is... ...that those poor souls on the other side... ...they are also proud of it. Do you understand? Oh yes. Please sit down. Please sit down. So... ...you wish to start the treatment of lepers,hmm? Yes. But your neighbours are simple, not educated. They won't tolerate lepers. They'll change. Change? You are a romantic, Miss Bethel. I've learned not to trust those who say... ...they do things for the benefit of others. Man can be tamed by having an abundance or by having nothing. Who is rebellious? Who is disobedient? Those who have only a little. So.. ...If there isn't enough for all... ...it's best that people have nothing. My children... ...bask in the light of my strength. It brings--stability. But I burden my children carefully. Kindly. Reading their faces adding to their burden in tiny increments. So... ...tranquility... ...an end to pointless aggression. You really ought to give up thinking, doctor. Learn to enjoy yourself. Have some--pastries, Miss Bethel. Thank you. I'm sure we can provide the means. To remove those coulds from your forehead. Don't offer me candy! What are you trying to do, bride mel? Get your hands... Stop! Stop. Take those boys away. Get out--get out! What in the name of God do you think you're doing? Are you trying to get yourself killed? With me, any duplicity's possible. What was all that about? Nothing, just a... ...little--low family joke. Stop it--stop it! Leave me alone you silly--eejit. I think we have to break the godfather's hold on us. That's exactly what I'm saying. We have to be cautious, this is not the most appropriate time. Oh come on, Sunil, how do you proceed with caution against someone... ...who considers you a chicken with a weight around your neck? You want to change things... you have to risk. Look, you back off this ,you compromise with this guy... ...and he will eat you alive. You, you can stand up. But we can't do that, we live here. I'm telling you if you stand up he will back off,I guarantee it. Max, this is not one of your American gangster TV shows, you know. Let me ask you something, let me askyou something, Max, now... HOW this is a self help society. So help yourself. So, so... are we not getting swept up with your thing here? I take of fence to that, saint Joan. Ah well, I'm sorry you're so sensitive but this, this is too important to piss about. It's hard to know when to trust you. I mean, you're, you're angry with everything. You ain't seen nothing yet. And you can afford to talk like this because. ...you're not going to be here tomorrow, you're going home. I am here! Max, we should think thrice before we do anything. For Ghatak is... ...is the saviour here. He has given us the jobs. Saviour. Hasari -- isn't it '2 Come on, speak out. See, he's given me a job. And I've been eating his salt. So what -- you're paying for it... And I promised him to remain loyal... Let him speak! Now... ...you know, it's, it's difficult... ...tO... I, I hope you understand Joan Di. I don't understand you people, you're acting like sheep. You bow your heads and take this nightmare like you have no choice. But I'm telling you... ...if you don't stop this asshole now he will ruin you for the rest of your lives. Ashish, Ashish, when Ghatak's son came into my shop he beat my son up... May I be allowed to speak? Just a minute, Kamla wants to say something. Now you want to speak. It's only because this is our home now. We've never know such friends. I think the god father is strong. And could kill us. But we must choose. Maxis, is only trying to help all of us and we should support him. I think we should stand up. Well I've got a property which I could let out. Say two hundred and fifty rupees a month. But not a rupee less! Those goras are going to build a new clinic on someone else's property. But they won't pay protection. I think the doctor must go. How many times a heart beats in a man's lifetime? I have calculated it two billion times. Very few. The woman the nurse she is okay. The doctor American doctor. He should go. He should go now. I'm ill I'm sick! I can't be bothered about it now. Are they going to bring in the lepers? - Yes. - Yes. Yes! Good. Let them climb well out on the branch. Then we'll out it. When I' m gone ...who will you be loyal to '2 Sorry I didn't realise it was you. Your father, babu. Remember loyalty. The godfather has made our life possible here. We shouldn't anger him. I think we can trust Max daddah. He'll stand by us. You know you are very beautiful. Oh, Kamla What about the children? We won't make noise. Max, is this going to be your room? No Joan Di's room. Is this fun? No. Look, Max honestly I didn't know all this would work. But it has. Now all you need is a Indian bride. Oh yeah, and you're gonna pick her? Get outta town! God, I never thought this day would come and yous all worked your socks off and I wish I had some champagne, but we haven't so we've got some sweets. Everyone can come to the new clinic.

Or do you want him to break your fingers? Please listen please let me please let me talk to babu Please let me explain I quit, I should have stayed quit. I became a doctor because my goddam father was a doctor. I played football because he played football. I ran for class president because my daddy was class president. And I'm done with it. Listen to me, Max. If you want to leave, tell us to go and stuff ourselves but don't try and blame anybody except yourself. All right then, I quit. I have given you light years more than I planned. I am not magic Max and I will not be invested in these people, with their needs and their clinging and their desperation. It's just too goddam painfull! That's what it is working with people, painful. And it's a struggle not to lose compassion or humanity but it's a struggle we can't afford to lose. Oh, bullshit. Ghatak is right. People are just out for themselves and everything else is a fraud. O What are you, saint Joan? Are you a fool or a fraud? Both. Both of those. But I'm here because I want to be here. Max, maybe the world was meant to break your heart. From the moment we're born, we're shipwrecked struggling between hope and despair. Oh God All of us. God junior. Not everyone's out out for this, you know. You did the very best you could. No, no Better than most. No I did not, lady. I messed up real bad. You're only human, Max. Yeah, I khow. Let us, let us not ever forget what is it, er, run, spectate, commit. Running, spectator. Whatever they are. The more you run the harder they'll chase you. Oh goddam. They took away my rickshaw. So what do you want me to do about it, get it back for you? But we trusted you. I guess that was your mistake, huh? They took away my rickshaw. You will have nothing to do with these people Or that clinic any more. Hasari, please, what I will earn will be for you and me. Sshhh, lie down quickly, lie down. Go to sleep come on, lie down.

Hello, Hasari. You didn't go to work today? It was a morrning shift, baba. I bought some food. Hasari, look I know you feel I let you down but don't punish Kamla. What happened is between you and me. And we need her at the clinic. Oh Hasari, please! The clinic is for everyone. And I think they'll pay me. No more clinic! I'm your husband and you will do what I will say. Stay away from him. He is not one of us. This is not his home. He's a he's tree with on roots. NO, but he is He will only be good to you as long as you please him. That is just not true Hasari. Please, don't teach me what is true. Just leave us alone. I've lost my rickshaw. I've lost my livelihood. I don't know what is going to happen to us. Max. I have something confidential to ask you. This disease of ours it is not a visitation for our past sins but an illness, yes? Right. I want to start a workshop. We have weavers and carpenters. We could weave cloth instead of begging. Anouar, it's a good idea but I Listen Max I know about this godfather, he's a clever man. He has got everyone to turn their backs on you. But I can show you how to get your way back into their hearts. That is why I want you to follow me. Please, I show you something. What is it? You will see it come on. You devil! You stole it? No, sahib. Where'd you get it? The police, sahib. And, er we have borrowed it from the police. Ta-da. It's great. I konw it's a little ratty but I'm good with my hands, you're good with your so, we can make it good as new. What do you think. Well? If I go out on the streets with this machine I'll die in the gutter with my throat cut. No you won't . Because the license the cops. That can all be fixed with bribes or something. And as far as the godfather's concerned, we just don't work in his area. And we have nothing to do with the sucker, here. So please take it. Please. Oh goddam, Hasari! Doctor Max, you you don't understand. Tell me. You are a gora a white man. You're you're different. You you think you can buy people's hearts by giving them things. Building clinics being a big man. For me trust is in the heart. And that is something which cannot be purchased. Purchased is that what you think? Is that what you really feel? All right. All right. Look, I'm a small man. No, shit! Born small and that's my fate. And I will not allow you again to tempt me with big thoughts. Oh no no, sir. Uh-uh. Small ain't the word for you, pal You are a little brown illiterate gutless victim. And you should take all this crap from the cops and the gangsters. And you should keep on locking up your wife being suspicious being jealous for no goddam reason.

And did I take your goddam rickshaw did I make you live in this shit hole'? No! So if you want to be pissed at me go ahead, that's fine.

He's not like his son. He came to the city with a little bundle. Hasari don't They could have killed my little son yesterday. Yes. - Max, it's not the point. - But Hasari - He's doing this to frighten all of us. -If you'd be the next tomorrow? - Max has nothing to do with it. - What would happen to your family? And in fact godfather has nothing to do with this. It's his son. Chomotkar da. What's happening? The godfather is dying. And the son is raising rent. Ram da, take care of this. Don't involve yourself. But they are our own people If the old man is dying we Rickshaw work, Zindahad Rickshaw union, Zindahad. My father is ill! Your godfather is dying!

Cars trying to run us down. We are threatened by corrupt police, we pay off officials we pay off Goondas. I'm proud to take my countrymen from place to place but I can't keep silent any longer. As someone said, if a man bows down too many times. There will come a time when he won't be able to stand up forever! Silence! There will be no commotion. I will make a restraining order against Ashoka Ghatak. This man will be permitted to use his rickshaw without let or hindrance. These men have clear and legal right to strike.

I couldn't save her. Proverbial last straw. You know. There was a man in the town when I grew up. Thirteen years his wife was dead and he still laid a place for her at One day he burned his house to the ground. And he left the town for good. We assumed he was a free man. Welcome home, junior.

Huh? ...like old magic Max... ...he spends all his time being afraid. Scared of all the bad things that could happen. But the guys on the front... ...somehow they stay full of hope. And they never ever, ever give up. Right? And you know what? What makes it possible to make it through all the rough stuff... ...is our love for each other. Huh? Baba... ...baba! Oh, Max daddah.

And continue the wheel of life. But you don't like the city --no. Chomotkar daddah. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm, I'm fine. I would be honoured if you'd come and sit next to my father. To bless the daughter. What are they doing? You have to pour the water in the hand. That's how the marriage is solemnised. Well now, junior. I bet you never thought you'd be giving away a daughter in a Calcutta slum. Well now, Sister Joan... I bet you never expected me to say that I'm glad to be here. I never felt more alive. So... ...now you're free to go. No -- now I'm free to stay. Well now, I just might be able to find something for you to do. I'm, I'm not promising mind because...
