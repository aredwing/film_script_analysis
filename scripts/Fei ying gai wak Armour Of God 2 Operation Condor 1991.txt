Look Water bags Used in saving lives. You've stolen the gems. Why drink the holy water? This is holy water? Do you know what the result is? It can't be poisonous, can it? Not poison. But one has to be her husband. Drinking the water is more serious than stealing gems? I was stronger than you. Don't run away. You're meant to replace me. Grab him. Grab him back Happy New Year Bye bye. The gems are here. Lead me to safety and the gems are yours. All efforts were in vain. Seems it's the end of the vacation. Please help yourself. Japanese? Right. Sir, can I ask you a favor? Sure, I'll buy one. Not that. I want to go to the toilet. Will you keep an eye on it? Sure, go ahead. Thanks. Won't be long. Miss, please feel free. Interesting dolls. Are they from Africa? Africa? Thought they were Japanese. You sell them yet don't know Do you know the price? Price? Rather cheap He's holding the doll. Must be something. Not that. The money is odd. - Thanks. - Thank you. Robbery Forcing people to change money? We're using the official rate. I don't want to change with you. This banknote seems all right. Follow her. Return it to me. All right. Here you are. Go. One for two. Not a bad deal. Thank you. I did some business for you. So much. The half sheet is? The man said he had no small change. Sold how many? Sold the one here. Thanks. Where did the dolls come from? I asked a friend to make them. I want this one. Sorry, I have to go now. With my compliments. Thank you. Stealing cars? Stop Stop fighting Condor, the Baron sent me. How are you, Baron? Welcome, Jackie. Isn't the Amazon River really beautiful? Not bad, the people are friendly too. Nice people are welcomed anywhere. Come and have tea. You didn't invite me here just for tea, did you? Do you know much about World War II? I only know that there mustn't be a World War III. In the later stages of the last war, when Germany's African Corps were falling back, an order went to an army commander to bury all the gold Germany looted, in a secret African base. The mission fell in Count Von Katterling. He ordered his aide and 18 guards to execute the order. But when the job was done, the aide and 18 guards all dissappeared. What has that got to do with me? The UN has commissioned me to find the gold. Since it was looted from many countries, there are bound to be ownership claims. I deemed it best to have an Asian to carry out the job unofficially. So here you are. Let me make the introductions. Col. Bart. This is Condor. Glad to know you. Lt. Col. Banner. Glad to know you. This is Ada. How do you do? Ada is Professor Pautz's student. She's familiar with the deserts. Surely she'll lead you to the place. Are you saying she is to lead me there? You don't seem to have confidence in me. That's not what I meant. I plan for the worst but hope for the best. Homework, plans and preparations are needed plus ability to play by ear. I am glad to work with a confident person. You are made to compliment each other. Col. Bart, show the Condor the key to the base The Baron will keep the key. Is the gold still there, after 40 years? The key has been with the government. No one could have made an entry. Don't worry. The robbers didn't need keys to enter Pharoah's pyramids. The site is top secret, out of reach to most people. I've another question. Yes? This job is for me and the Condor. Is case of dispute, whose word goes? Your suggestion? Anything goes. Then I'll make the decision. All right. Royal Library. Tomorrow I want to go... Wait for my decision. Tomorrow morning at 10. There's something else to discuss. I'll go first. All right. See you when we start... All right. See you tomorrow. Bye. I've prepared all the data. An occasional setback is exciting too. I agree. What do you know about deserts? There's a lot of sand. Wrong. Sand covers only one fourth of the Sahara Desert's whole area. The daytime temperature could be 60 degrees Celsius, but at night it could be -5 degrees Celsius. There is no rainfall for years. A man can survive 7 days if he takes no food but water. But he dies in two days without water. Are you listening? Sure, I was just looking at this photo. He is the aide in charge of the mission. He should have some descendants who live around here, What are you doing? I'll look him up. No use. Bonn sent people over but found nothing. End of today's geography lesson? I'll go now. Don't leave. We haven't solved the water issue. Oh, it's her Give it a try. Who are you? Get away Get away Help Don't be afraid. Be quiet, and I won't hurt you. What do you want? I can give you money. Don't worry, I'm not after money. I've come for... Don't be afraid, I'll help you. Who are you? Who are you? I am asking you. Me? I'm here to save you. Who are you exactly? Let me ask him. Who are you? Freeze or I'll shoot. Who we are isn't important, we're only looking for gold. You came from the mall till here to look for gold? Ask her. So, you're those constantly calling me. You're Hans, the aide's grand-daaughter. If you don't tell us where the gold is, we'll kill you. No, I'm against violence. We must use violence to remind the world of our plight. If we use violence, people will call us terrorists, see? Shut up Don't quarrel before others. Tell us quickly, where the gold is. Or we kill your boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. Right, I'm not her boyfriend It's none of my business. Bye bye. Stop, then why are you here? I was looking for a house to rent. Then I heard some noise in the bathroom. So I took a look. I saw everything. I am sorry. You want to see? Don't move How many are in your organization? What's your plan to get the gold? We won't tell We'd rather die than talk. God is with us. We shall overcome Keep it for later use. Don't soil her house. Go away. Stop disturbing this lady. We won't give up. Justice is with us. Besides taking of my towel, isn't there any other way? One goes for efficiency. Morning, Mr. Anderson. Good morning. My friend says you're Europe's No. 1 locksmith. Please look at this key. All right, let me see. This key is in three parts. Some links are insulated. That is, it could touch off electric equipments. This knob is designed for a purpose. Some mechanisms inside? It must be accompanied by a code which may be changed after use. So the code is known to the last user only. Come to me when you fail to open the door. Fine, thank you. You two... Why are you following me? Give me everything in the pocket, fast. Not these, the key. Make way. It's him. Get him. That way Make way Be careful, the painting is priceless. Careful, it's for an auction tomorrow. My painting Damn, how do I explain it? Why are you stealing my paints? You bastard One more photo. Make way. It's dangerous. Up front. My baby Let me go. I must rescue my baby. Help Help My baby Don't go over there It's dangerous Your baby. My baby. Over there. Ram him to death Stop him. We won't let you go Your reward is 1%% % of the gold. So little? Not little at all. There are 240 tons altogether. But one must come out alive first They are plainly out to steal it. Your previous enemy? No, they insisted on getting the key. I didn't invite you here to admire the wild life. Just a second. Any new information for me? I've thought it over. I go to the desert with you. This is...? Grand-daughter of the German aide. A beautiful lady. How are you? I want to find out how Grandfather dissappeared. Let me go with you, please? Absolutely no problem. I don't think so. That's not a 7-day tour of Africa. And she's so close to the German officer. I don't think grandfather hid the gold and himself. I want to prove it. Take me along. Let me take charge of her. You agreed I've the final say. Ada, she may be of great help to us. I'll decide on that. You go along together. Very well. Thank you. I'll leave the car here. Bye-bye. Thanks. Wish you good luck, bye. Bye -bye. Bye -bye. The gods welcome you Thanks to your god Is dinner any good? You came to Sahara to look for gold? Do we look like that type? Is there gold here? We've never heard of it. Please take your time. Don't be shy. Everybody in the desert knows it. Where do you think the map is? You are so curious. Possibly the soldiers who buried the gold hid it. They've been missing so long. They're probably dead. Disappearance is not exactly death. Then why didn't it surface? Possibly they are trying to ship the gold away. You mean they coorperating to find the gold? I don't know. Maybe only a few of them. Or they do it all separately. Or some are getting help from relatives? You mean me and my grandfather? I didn't say that. I know you despised me at first sight. What a pity for you to think that way Don't quarrel with so many around. Food not tasty enough? Why aren't you eating? Miss, you didn't touch your food. I'm not hungry. I'll leave. How? The check please. Take the food away. Really not eating? No, we're not. Since you're not eating, I'll take it to them. We came together. No need to be like that You came with her, I didn't. I'll return to the room. Jackie. What's that? Come in. Good night then. Anything missing? I don't know. My magnetic tape is finished. Jackie. What? Somebody seached my room. Look, all in shambles. Luckily the key was with me. Why didn't you keep these well? Who did it? Good question. You came up first. Didn't you see him? You mean I did it? I didn't say that. You said it. My luggages were searched too. A thief may cry "Thief" Fine, you search my luggages Surely you haven't found it or you won't be here acting. Elsa. Jackie. What? Your room's too small. Spend the night with me. Take the sleeping bag along. My house isn't big but can take 3. Aren't you used to sleeping alone? African vampires don't go for Chinese women. Don't waste your anger over such people. I'll go and scold her. Forget it. It only makes everyone unhappy. Worse than doing farming labor back home. Don't be to hard on her. Okay, lock the door. I'll be back soon. I know. The water mustn't stop right now. I'll kill you. Don't run away. I'll kill you. Oh, it's you Nonsense. I know you wanted to beat me up. Look before you attack. I wanted to beat you up and I had a good look. Your friend? Search her luggages. Again. I just did the packing. Good sleep. One more chocolate. OK, thank you. Bye bye. Thank you. Good sleep. Good night. Bye -bye. Room service. Good evening. What's the matter? Chocolate. Good sleep. No chocolate, no good sleep. No good sleep? Go. We can't sleep. Ah... condom? Condom? Good sleep, very good sleep. Condom, good Magic. Magic, good magic. Thank you. Won't bother you anymore. Goodnight, if anything, let me know. Good night. Goodnight. Ada. Why did you come? I don't want to see you. Go away, quick Why are you treating me like that? Nothing to explain, go Jackie Don't come any nearer Jackie doesn't have time. You said you were going to tell her. I didn't have time to tell her. We have things to do. Things to do? What's to do between you two? What's this? Me dressed like that What happened? Go. We can't wait any longer Go, understand? You're revolting Go. Produce them right now. Don't pretend you know nothing. Where is the stuff? Where is what? Don't. Don't beat him. Tell me what you're after. The map and the key. So, you're after the map and the key. I don't have them either. Stop it. Tell or he gets killed. I don't know even if you kill him. Stop it. Why don't you beat her as well? Then I might tell, out of sympathy. Okay, I'll tell. In his underpants. Do you believe her? Talk. Or I take the towel. Heard him? He says to take away my towel. Great I'm trying to have a look. Jackie, help Stop moving Told you not to move. Bite him Good sleep. Don't move. Room service. Come in. What's that? Roast chicken. Cooked with a secret recipe. Roast chicken. Have a good time, bye Don't move One move and I shoot. Great I know you can do it. Clever girl To foresee the return. I hinted as much. Surely I got it. I'm very clever. Taking off my towel? I'm beginning to like you. Me too. Shoot Jackie, what are you doing? Why so much tape? The gun might fall off. Go over there. Sorry. Told you not to come in. We don't want to hurt anyone. But we don't mind it either. Surrender the map and key. Pronto. I really don't have them. You've checked the room. Do I look like the lying type? I can't help it if you don't believe me. Even if you kill me, it isn't here. Stop acting. I'll count to three. Then I kill you one by one. Why are you staring foolishly? Why did you take off my towel? I know why she did it. Why are you beating me? For looking at me. They had a look too. Go beat 'em. Damn you Let's not waste time. Start with her. Me first? One. Aren't you telling? Two. How about it? Three. Hold it. I'll tell. You really mean to tell them? You told me too. But telling you is no help to you. My brothers are here. You can't get away. Really? Don't you believe me? Brothers, time to come out. Catch. Hold it as if your life depends on it Don't move I have the bullets. Take them. You take them back. There's one more bullet. Ada, where are you going? Keeping these in a safe place.

Help Stop him The key is right in front of you. I can see. What's the matter? There are robbers Robbers? Ada, picked up the key? The key dropped there. How about you? Did you get hurt?

Without it, my mind doesn't work. No money, no talk. I got it. They left this morning. Where did they go? To the desert. Don't mind him. Go. God will punish you. This world is really small, we bump into her again. You're here to discover the meaning of death. Why are you doing it? We live, we must die without knowing why. So I came to the desert. Right, the desert is closest to death. What desert language are you speaking? Jackie, understand what they're saying? I won't know what you don't know. But I know water and life are precious. Right. Skin care is important too. I hate sun -baked skin. What are you doing? Scorpions. Hit No more. All gone. Why are you a man, afraid of scorpions? It is behind you. On my body. O my goodness Ada. Help Damn it. Catch it for me. Help me Be careful. It's poisonous. Don't worry. It's mine. Where is it? Stamp on it Its name is Ding Dong, my pet. It bites you only if you provoke it. Sorry to have scared you. The moon is beautiful. I must go to sleep. Attack What are you doing? Help Stop fighting You dare hit me? Get me the gun. Give it to me. What kind of scorpion is this? King scorpion, I guess. Let me finish it. Let's go. Take away the car too. Quick The thieves are gone. Are you all right? Quite all right. O my Ding Dong Not so hard. Are you all right? Nothing. But John had it bad. Who are they? Desert robbers. Take me to find them at daybreak. No. We daren't fight them. I'll take you there. I know the land. But I must bury my Ding Dong first. Okay. So many people. It's like a market. It's a market, a slave market. Soon to start. Start when night falls. Once. Twice. Thrice. Sold. We've come to the climax of tonight's auction. Here's the rope. Keep an eye. This is the Aryan blonde. This is the Oriental Kitten. Their appearance is rare. The blonde's ample derrier means she'll have many kids. Her exquisite skin. Bottom call: 10 camels.

Please give me water. Please, give them some water. Is it all right to give them water? Request rejected Not even enough for ourselves. I plead to you. Don't worry. If one must die, we die together. Bitch, playing tricks Directed us to the wrong place Even the sun's in the wrong direction You're reading the map upside down. Let me have a better look. One embrace and you'll feel better. Careful. They may find out. Enough. Come and be embraced. You'd feel better too. I haven't had enough of it. Thirsty and held tight. Can't stand it. Let me hold. No hurry. Take your time. So thirst leads to lust. Take your time. One more. Aren't you overheated? One more. Enough, enough. Don't give me that look. I don't need an embrace. You'll know when I hold you. One more.

Oh my goodness They saw it. Give. Anymore tricks and I'll kill all of you. Fighting Now even the last water source is gone. Still sitting here Get up. Let's go. This is the place, if the map is any good. Too much sand. Takes too long to shovel. You might have gotten things wrong. Read the map yourself then. Give me the map. Let them have a look. Give it to me. Get a compass first. It's movable. It's definitely here. Sandstorms around here are notorious. Sands might have buried the base. You're saying that this is the base, aren't you? Right, the bearings' right. Even maps make mistakes. This is a military map. Highly accurate. Margin of error is less than 3 kilometers. What, 3 km The taxi meter ticks scores of times. Please favor us with your direction God Armand. Don't move Armand. Give them water. Don't want to see you ever again. Thank you. Thanks? This water is ours. Bye bye. We'll get you. You'll get the divine punishment. Don't come over. I've never ever failed before. Well, you have one now. This photo's yours? My grandfather's. This is our destination. The tribesmen are friendly to me. This is their god. I bought the doll because of the resemblance. Jackie, look This photo must have been shot near the base. Take us there, immediately We have not yet lost. We finally found this place. Don't go. A vicious tribe has taken over. Vicious people? We're yet to meet such people You have sharp tongue. No more talk. Get in. Thank you. Take care. Thanks for taking us here. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. What are you doing? Just to see if it's hollow. The road is over there. Come Jackie, don't walk too fast. It, s dark here. Dark because of the sunglasses. You two, watch over there. I'll look the other side. Be careful. Jackie. Finished so quickly? Finished watching. Let's go. It's a head. Don't panic. It's an ox's head, not a human head. What are you doing? Some flying object. What's that? A human head. What? Let's go. There's somebody up front. This side. And make it snappy. Where are you going? Go over there. One by one. We're tourist's. Right, we're tourists. Go, quick Nowhere to go What to do? One for each. Get going fast. Hit, hit, hit, can't hit him till he faints. Of course You hit so lightly. Now hit him hard Again? Have you ever seen it? Chinese Kung Fu. They dance to convert their enemies into friends. Right, some tribes are that way. Come on, let's dance with them. Left foot first. Don't dance. That song calls for help. What now? Play by ear. Many human heads and ox heads. Jump over. They've stopped chasing. Won't even pick up diamonds. Just go. They're getting help. They're so many, still calling for help? What are you doing? Save me I'm sinking. Come. Jackie, where are you? Don't move. I'm coming. I haven't moved. You should look for me first. Where are we? Don't know. What is it? Possibly a foot. It's nothing. Don't be afraid. Now what is it? I'm scared. Don't be afraid. What is it then? German lettering. It says: No Smoking in the camp. Coming Give me water. Give it to me. It's mine. What? Come over. It looks like a military base. Lots of dust. That's my grandfather. Are you sure he's your grandfather? Don't move Your grandfather was killed by someone. How did you know? Look Oh you I am sorry. You are really sure? Right. He's been dead for years. Don't be too sad. I'm sad because of the way he died. What's that? A diary. Don't you touch me. See what's written. The diary is my grandfather's. Any word left by him? See if he identified his killer. "A 20-km march today. Four colleagues were sunstruck". Turn to another page. "War is turning against us. But I'm confident Field Marshal will triumph. Erwin Rommell is a peerless military genious." Anything really important? "A lot of heavy metal was moved in today" "The Count ordered me to move it into lab No.1". "Heavy metal"? Gold? He mentions gold here. "The Count gave me 18 tablets. One for each after the gold was moved" He writes:"To open or close the base, we need a code". "Let's use Eliza's birthday as the code." Who's Eliza? She's my mother. Do you remember her birthday? I do. But why was my grandfather so agonized? Read on. I know why. If I'm right, these were his guards who were fed the poison by your grandfather when the mission was completed. So he was very unhappy to kill 18 colleagues at one go But here are only 15. Plus the two above, the total is 17. One is missing. There's one clever one... He didn't take the poison from your grandfather. Are you all right? Who's he? If I'm not mistaken, you're Adolf. How did you know? Your name's sketched on the knife. You're the clever one who didn't take the poison. And your the one who killed my grandfather. He's wicked, fed us with poison. I refused. He broke both my legs. I've been waiting for today to arrive. But the gold belongs to the United Nations. As long as it's here, it's mine. Find the gold first. How must we go? This was the exit. You go first. Don't pull tricks kid. Who are the others? Mercenaries. They help me on the mission. They just work for the money. Get going. Let's pay more to get them to work for us. It's possible even your share be robbed in time. Don't try to make trouble. Go. Go. Go, quick. This way. This way. Faster. Go down. Mark, Mark. What's that? There's a generator. Try to start it. You go and start it. Yes. The others continue the chase. Yes. Yes. Don't shoot at random. Don't shoot at random. Ammunitions down there. Go down and hide, quick They've gone in. Go in and chase. Split and search. Be careful. Don't shoot No use. The door is break-proof. Try again. Yes Don't switch on the lights, by all means. They've found us Jackie, where are you? One is missing. Don't switch on the light. With lights on, they can't escape. Almost there. Faster, faster. It's on. Don't move Or I shoot. Put your hands on your head and stand aside. Great You are great. Ada, throw away all guns. That's okay. Be careful of accidental discharge. Where to throw then? I've bound them with a rope. If they move, shoot Okay. Don't move. I'll shoot. Don't act foolish. She means it. Don't move. You're really clumsy. Don't move. Jackie, Jackie. It's useless calling me. Charge Take care of yourself. Jackie. I'm occupied. Ram him against the wall Once more. Try again. Once more. What now? Up the staircase. Fast. Let's continue to fight. Give chase. Intercept him. Don't let him get away. We fight him again. Fight again. Go over quickly Help me quick Victory. In the middle. Spanish bullfight. Fainted yet? Quite so. We go over there to help. Charge The few of us... Joe, open up See if my hand is all right. Nothing at all. Bitch Fainted before I hit you You, give the key to me. How are you? Know this; only I know how to use the key. My grandfather set the code to my mother's birthday. Only I know her birthday Only I know the unlocking procedure. Is it complicated? Could be. Wait until we see the gold. Now how do we go from here? There is a passage. Go over there. Condor, you go first. Open the door. What's the code? There are 3 keys, a different code each time. My mother was born on Sept Got it. I've waited 40 years for this day. You cheated me. You tried to kill me? I didn't cheat you. I told you all that I know. My mother was born on Sept Anything you people forgot? Don't talk anymore, you three go and open the door Did you get Mama's birthday correctly? No mistake. It's Sept 16. Lunar calender or Gregorian calender? Foreigners don't use lunar calender. Grandpa did write: "Use Eliza's birthday." Isn't it good enough? So he wasn't sure himself. Could he have used your birthday? Let's try my birthday. Try? What's that? Grandfather's necklace. Could it be this number? How about this one? Which is the right one? These bullets can pierce 10 bodies. The first number is 6. You're troublesome. Take the hand away. Why can't it open? What's that? The key's handle was built for a purpose. Now what? I'm scared. I'm truly scared. There's nothing. Don't be afraid. Go and help. Why is this base so small? And the gold is said to be hidden here. This is the elevator, idiot. Go inside. Take a look. Take away the canvas. Fast. Yes. The canvas at the top. Yes. Gold Really a lot of gold. Two and a half tons are mine. We're rich Push me in Push me in Right now they won't listen to you. Push me in Stinking rich Don't move Tell them to lay down the guns, or I'll bash your head Did you hear? Throw down the guns. No need for that. Idiot, come and rescue me. Don't call me idiot any more. Try to find a way to save me. I'm now in charge. Don't talk to me so loudly. What? A rebellion? For 240 tons of gold, we'd defy anyone. Kid, if you like, kill him You're playing "Show Hand"? I count to 3. If you don't drop the gun, I'll shoot. One Two Three He won. Makes no difference to me if you kill or spare him. There's a lot of gold behind the passage. Spare me and I'll help you find it. You're the end of your tricks. Look after them. Condor, follow me. The others move the gold out. Yes. Move it, quick All right. Move it, quick Yes, sir. What's up? What should we do now? Up there is the control room. Let's go see how the Condor is doing. Okay. Ada, go. Don't look about. Coming. They are down there indeed. Very dark here. Switch the light on. Over there. The light won't light up. That's not the light switch. With so many switches, which is the right one? Can't you find a switch without giving trouble? Switch off the fan. Which switch? Right, so many of them Which one? Try. It's even worse. Ada, could it be these switches? What switch? Seems to have slowed down. Stop him. I'll open the door Why hasn't Adolf come up? Can Momoko hold up Adolf? Right. Let's go help her. How come? It's bad. My hands are full. You open it? Me doing it? How could it be like that? What to do now? We haven't tried that row of switches. Quick Strike Strike Don't touch that switch. But I've pressed it.
