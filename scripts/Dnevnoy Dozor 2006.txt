And nobody remembers any more how the armies of Light and Darkness collided on the bridge of the law How the blood flowed How the heart of the great Djassar couldn't take it anymore and how he stopped the battle. But one day, when night will be longer than day, There will come a new Great one, and the world will be plunged into darkness And nothing could save us anymore, nothing but the Chalk of Destiny This Chalk is kept in an castle that can not be taken, And everyone who came for it and entered the gates died in the endless Labyrinth. And thus it was always Until Tamerlan came. "Northern Iran, Tamerlan's Army" Have mercy on me! Have mercy on me, I did not wrong you in any way! The Chalk is there! Greetings Tamerlan, hard and merciless! I will rule the destinies of the world! But you do not even rule you own destiny. - What do I write? - What do you want? -To live! -Then write that. The Chalk is there! You already told me that... Since then Tamerlan didnt make any irreversible mistakes. -Interested? - Trainee Nazarova, please put the book back! -Do you think this is true, about the Chalk? -You want to fix something? -Please move your knee! -Listen, why are you always so rude to me? -That's it, please move your knee! - Some grub would be nice -Would you like...me to invite you to a restaurant? -What restaurant? -That Chinese one. -Chinese? I would like that. Tomorrow at six...no, at seven. -Really? -Really. -Then that's when I'll invite you. -Do that. -If nothing will happen. - VDNH, who is near VDNH? - Gorodetsky is flying, five minutes! - There was an attack on a human! - Again it's an old lady, same signature. Use of a charged needle. The victim....The needle entered below the shoulder blade, penetrated the spine and the network The criminal is sucking the life force out of the victim. We can not identify the attacker. - Be careful, he's dangerous - I can't go there, I have a trainee with me! - Fourteen eighty five, we accept your call. - Thanks, I knew you would let me down! These critters have bred too much, they should be squashed! No venturing into the twilight without me, understood? Don't move quickly, breathe deeply. Don't even peek into the second level! Why, what is there? No idea, I've never been there myself . They say that there are mosquito's there Even mosquito's don't live there! - Boris Ivanovitch says that mosquito's live there. - Well, if HE says so, then of course... So, only use the torch to illuminate things.... - But this button... - What's this butt...? -There she is! -Sveta! Sveta! Sveta! What the hell are you doing? Sveta! Did someone tell you to get out of the car? I bent down and...Right under the shoulder blade...Pricked me like it was a needle... That scum! Stop! Stop! Sveta! You're better right? Stay here, I'll be back in a few What a crowd... Bitches, all ran away! Sto-o-o-p! Stop! Stop! Come, come here! Behind you! Behind you! Go back! Stay where you are! Stay there! Nazarova, what kind of amateur performance was that? Why did you disturb me? I almost had him! I'll deal with him myself, understood? Where do you know him from? - He's an acquaintance of mine! - But he's a Dark one! - Dark, Light, what's the difference? How did it happen to you? The world is not without kind people. (The windows spell out "Day watch") You'll do everything I say, as long as you're wearing this ring. - I'm hurting! - You're hurting? But we will die on one same day! -Sign this please! What's this? The contract. - Another contract! - But we have not signed any contracts with each other yet ! - Not with you! - It's for hiring the ballroom. How much? A thousand dollars. An hour. For this? Have you lost your conscience entirely? Such are the times.... There's not much time left... Zevulon! Yegor? - What happened? - You yourself said that only the Great ones can go into the Second Twilight level! Give me weapons! Give them to me! You promised! A couple of minutes ago near the VDNH metro station a murder of a human has been prevented. A Dark one, before everyone's eyes, attacked a woman. - Have you arrested him? - No. - Then you have nothing. - Well, we have physical evidence. - What evidence? Now you've done it! Who the hell is she? Rogova, don't you explain to your pupils what happens if you kill a human? They won't be able to prove anything! And where's your hat? - That's all we have, eh? - Yes. - And how did he look like? - I just don't remember. You don't remember? All right, then our guys in the laboratory will figure it out. Anton, give me the keys to your car, will you? I haven't gone in the metro for forty nine years! Keys coming up! Here. So, how are you feeling? How do you feel? You have to eat now. Let's go and eat. Why didn't you say that he was an acquaintance of yours? So now what do we do? Where are you going? Can't we just steal that bloody hat? Ah, still hacking the homeless? But of course not, pure donors! - I have a question. Here's a license that my son got. For the drawing of first blood. - Congratulations. - But you know, he doesn't drink! - The Night Watch is already working. - Where do they keep their material evidence at night? - In the Archive. - You have time until the morning. - Yes, but how will I get inside there? - Only very quickly. - He wasn't there, so I signed for him. Now I don't know how to tell him about it... - Why, isn't he a born vampire? - No, he bit him himself. He had double sided pneumonia! Yeah, right, and the mother too had pneumonia.... Bitch! I 'm sorry... It's ok, such things happen... What about giving him a delay? I know that you can....I will do anything...Anything you need.... - Anything I need? - That's illegal, you know Did you understand? Understand what? How will I get that hat out of the Archives of the Night Watch? How, how... Involve the parent of course! - So, nitwits, do you have some food for the child? - Come on, come on! Hurry up! Here, drink, you need to. -Yes? -Hello, good evening, this is Galina Rogova, Yegor's teacher, you see, the thing is, that your son has lost his hat... -Youve got the wrong number. Do you know how many hats like that there are in Moscow? Very good. You'll go far. -Went into the second twilight level... -I'll go nowhere. -I barely could get a hand in there... -Eh, can we order something to eat? But you've already ordered! I don't remember.... Very good... Why are you so dirty? Look at yourself. Oh, Boris Ivanovitch! And, what are you doing here? -Well, we... are waiting for the dumplings. -But you have a lecture now! Oh, really? I forgot... -So tomorrow... -Definitely, at seven o'clock. I forbid you to form informal relationships with trainees. -It's too late already, Boris, too late. -Here you are. -Thank you. -Asalam aleikum, Zoar. (Speaks an Asian language) Anton, she'll soon become a Great one, and there's no place for two Great ones near the VDNH metro. Do you mean me? No, Anton, I mean your son. If he will collide with Sveta, the world will be plunged into darkness. See, you are a Light one, Anton, but you drink dark beer. That was a talk from heart to heart.... Eat, Yegor, eat. You have a Great day tomorrow. Strengthen yourself. Why, what's tomorrow? There will be many guests. Grandma Dasha is free, she'll come, introduce you to Mashenka. Presents So, what kind of present would you like? -That one is a bit too early for you. -I don't want it either. If you don't want it, we'll teach you, if you can't we'll make you(Russian proverb) "When he was dying, Tamerlan ordered to be buried with his fists closed." "Tamerlan's will was carried out." Could you wrap the dumplings up for me, Zoar? I'm going home. -These are "manti". -Wrap them up anyway. Oh, "The lives of remarkable people" HE should have such a remarkable life as mine. On the one hand his son is on the dark side, on the other his girlfriend is flaunting her talents. Timerlan also had problems with his son. Now, what kind of problems could he have with his son? What problems? They killed him. You shouldn't drink anymore, Anton, or you'll cause something on the road. You are a golden guy, Zoar. How much do I owe you? A hundred. Still drank it. "But the burial site of Tamerlan remained unknown for a long time" "In 1941 under the leadership of academic Gerasimov an expedition to Samarkand was organized. "But the war interfered with the scientists work and all information about the expedition was lost in numerous archives, Special storages devoted to Middle Asia." What kind of bullshit is this... Hear me out, Gorodetsky. He'll be in big trouble. They'll disembody him. You have the wrong number. How can you not be ashamed of yourself? You are his father! Yegor's birthday is tomorrow. Do you at least remember that? -Make your son a present. -What present? -A hat. -What hat? -A dark one. Do you know how many hats like that there are in Moscow? I can not help you with anything. Me? You. -I'll write a letter to the inquisitors. -Write whomever you want. The likes of you should be squashed! "Today our contender is tough and the whole country is glued to the television. At this moment everyone is watching football!" "This is a dangerous moment, he hits the ball, the goalkeeper blocks the ball!" "And our boys begin a counterattack. It's a long pass...." Hey! Hey, you dog! Hey! It's fifteen minutes to time out...Then more time doing nothing... "Archive, Don't venture or you'll be killed" Hi Ignat! "He has to hit it.....GOAL!!!!" "The main thing is not to retreat, not to retreat into the defence, we need to risk it and be on our guard..." "Middle Asia, special storage" "Fund nr.43, The Chalk of Destiny" "I'm asking permission to organize an expedition to the city of Samarkand, for the purpose of uncovering the burial chamber in the architectural complex of Gur-Emir. "According to our research it contains the remains of the great military commander Tamerlan..." "...in whose right hand there lies...the Chalk of Destiny" "Boris Geser, 19th of june 1941, FORBIDDEN" -Do you know Alice, he looked at me in such a way that I got the creeps. -Why, is no one covering you? -Me? -Shall I come to you? -Thanks, I will deal with it myself. -Be careful, all right? -Hello, Galina, whats with you? -Sorry, I m just very tired. -I understand. -Call me back? -Better you call me. -All right. I'll just get home. -Galina? -Whos there? What kinds of jokes are these? Who's there? -A judge. -Oh, really? And whom shall we judge? -You! Galia! Galia! Let me go! Its my daughter! -There is no damage on the body. Why are you so sure that she was murdered? Because we know who killed her. I will throw that telephone at your head, understood? -Give me Zavulon, and quickly! -He's not there. -Did you tell him it's me? -I did. -What's up with him? -He's not available. Where are you going? Stop! -I did everything. Now, you did promise to help.... -Go to work. In the evening I'll tell you what to do next. -Hello! -Dont you worry so much! Will a knock on the door make your arm fall off? -Oh, look whos come to visit! Listen, I keep failing to reach your girlfriend -They killed Rogova. -You know who did it. -Hes totally lost it! -Galina met Gorodetsky last night. -We need incriminating evidence. GO! GO! I...Go! Shall I take the car with me? " Chalk of Destiny" "Gur-Emir" "Samarkand" "Tamerlan's burial site" (Books a ticket to Samarkand) (MSN Messenger has a message from Zavulon: Thank you, you helped your son and...) "Thank you, you helped your son and all of us. Destroy the evidence as soon as possible and don't forget to congratulate Yegor on his birthday." (Warning! System Error!) So! Let's go! That's it! -What, have you not slept well? -Why, are my eyes red? All right, that's it. Let's go to Boris. -What for? -Let's go, let's go! In the city a lot of Dark ones have appeared without registration, we are checking them from district to district. -We've checked Dmitrievka, Yaroslavka, also the branch in Bibirevo, it was so.... -Early! About 580 lamps are missing, we haven't placed them yet. So many of them have come, that it's becoming dark. They are preparing for some kind of coven or Black Sabbath.... Ilya, do you remember Galina Rogova? -Rogova? -Yes, Rogova. -In my opinion shes very dangerous, may breach the Agreement. -She already wont. This morning Galina Rogova was discovered dead, in the hall of her building. No wounds on her body. Cause of death: total loss of Force. -Miss! Miss! -Whats the girls name? -Does this man seem familiar to you? -No. Mashenka, Masha Rogova. I'll talk to the girl. You don't object, do you? -Hello Mashenka! -Hello. -Is it a good turtle? -Just like a real one. -Do you know this man? -No And your mom, where is she? My mom has gone away, for a long time. Your mom didn't go away, little one. Your mom has died. What do you mean, died? Died for ever. Grandma, grandma! What is it my lovely, what is it my good girl? Grandma, mom has died...died for ever... My god, my poor baby, who told you this? That aunty came and told me. Who? Which auntie? There is no one here! My God! That must have been your mom, who came to say good bye to you! So, as you understand, we have been presented with the accusation that a Light one is working in Moscow, who is not familiar with the Agreement or even worse... ...is ignoring it. That's the structure of the moment. Any questions? None. Then thank you all and good bye, but for Semyon, Olga, Ilya and... ...Anton. Thank you for the compliment, Boris Ivanovitch. I'm forced to conduct an employee investigation. Write me an explanation about where you have been last night and.... ...who can confirm your alibi. Miss, may I have the ball? -What are you studying for, college boy? -To be a biologist. Want to learn how to live without human blood? You're cute. A pity you're a vampire though...We could have been friends... Why, now we can't? But why not? Don't be mad. You know what you can tell me instead? Have you seen your friend and neighbor yesterday? And where did you get the idea that he's my friend? -You are entitled to do whatever you want -As you are a Dark one, you can even be friends with Light ones! You are very witty.... Yesterday night, in the hall of her building, Galina Rogova was killed. -So, what do I have to do with it? -She left a five-year old daughter. Yesterday night I saw her with Gorodetsky. Thank you. -What's up with you? -Yesterday evening Rogova met Gorodetsky. -How do you know? -I have a witness. The little vampire....... -How did you know that? -Come to me, I've missed you. -Hello? -Get me Gorodetsky. When Rogova was being killed, Gorodetsky was breaking into the archive. Right. -That means he has an alibi. -But he will never admit it and rightfully so. -Yes...But then we'll have to hand him over to the Dark ones. -And what will they do with him? No idea, but they won't get him alive! You've thought of something! Come in! -Have you seen the Boss? -Take a seat. -Forgive me Olga, but I need to do this. -Do what? -I understand. -But I don't underst.... What....What are you doing? Forgive me, Anton... You wouldn't have agreed otherwise... Anton? Everything will be all right. -May I see Geser? -You and your Geser can go to hell! Anton, come back, nobody gave you permission to leave. -What will we do about the voice? -Very simple. -Try it, this should work. -Right away. -Right away. -You made a transvestite out of me! -Why, you don't like it? How do you poor men walk? -Right. Now, Anton, remember: I don't smoke. Your lipstick is smudged, shall I fix it? -I'll manage. -Remember, don't put anything in your pockets, that's what your purse is for. Posture, posture! You are a woman! -Aha. -Listen, why the hell is my arse wiggling? -Residual reflexes! -You piece of.... -Quiet, quiet you... -Good day, Boss. -Good day. Ah, I'll drop by, I will! And, how long am I supposed to live like this? -And where will I live? -Call one of the guys, arrange it. Hey, I will ask Semyon. Semyon, can I stay with you for a while? -When do you want to move in? -Today. -Then I'm sorry. -No problem. -May be at Svetlana's? -Hey, that's a good idea! -What will I tell her? -You can tell her that Boris Ivanovitch snores at night. I snore????? All right, now you know how to determine an object that is concealed from us by some barrier. Svetlana, please demonstrate the wonders of enteroscopy! Who is behind that door? It's Anton Gorodetsky. -Hi. -Please forgive me, I.... -Welcome, Olga. It's a great honor for us.... We were just going over the basics of enteroscopy...May be you could demonstrate a thing or two to us, since you are already here? -Just a little bit, something, just one little... -I'm sorry, next time, I'm in a hurry now... Could I take Svetlana with me? (speaks like a guy) Since when do you smoke? Poor Sveta, what will she do with him now? -Thanks. Let's go. -Listen, Anton will be here shortly. -He's not coming. -How do you know that? -He's extremely busy now. -Wait a minute, we were going to a restaurant! -No time for restaurants now. Let's go, I'll explain everything later. "Retro FM" -May I ask you something? -Sure, ask. -Do you like Anton? -Do you? He's a bit strange. I get the feeling that he's afraid of me. Not as a woman, no, but.... -And not really afraid but somehow...somehow... -Keeping you at a distance? Yes! Yes, seems so.... Nothing surprising about that. You are a future Great sorceress, and he barely got his third category.... First and foremost I am a woman, and I couldn't give a damn about his category....... I LOVE HIM AND..... (Song on the radio; "Nor the night, nor the dirt, nor a sharp turn, nor a steep hill scare you; to keep your loved one from crying, hold the steer tighter, driver!') -Be careful -You are crazy! -Look, I know it's not my business, but I wanted to tell you... ...It looks to me that he also loves you very, very much, but he's just afraid Afraid that a time will come when you will be too far. -All of us will once be too far, but now I'm near, near! -Now you are near, yes. Go! Now you're near. Young ladies, are you alive? We'll help you in a minute, hold on! Then I called him at night. Come in...He wasn't at home. Then I called his mobile and he hung up! May be he had some business. -May be he has someone? -He hasn't had a woman for 12 years. -Then he must have a complex. -Biocomplex, magically slows down the aging process, strengthens the sexual energy field. Aha. Hey, why are you looking at me like that? I'm going into the shower, you can put the kettle on if you want. Listen, why hasn't he had a woman in 12 years? Strange. Why, why....... You know, Sveta... -...How could I explain this to you... -Olga! -There are some moments... -Olga! -During which a human life is broken forever. -..Why forever? -Olga, could you please bring me the towel, it's in the cupboard. -I'm not Olga, I'm..... -What? What are you saying, I can't hear anything! -What are you doing there? -I'm not Olga, I'm Anton and I love you.... -What is it? I'm not Olga, I'm Anton. They've switched our bodies. How dare you! You asshole! How could you...you've planned all of this! Get out of here, I don't want to see you, get out, how dare you, you took advantage of this, how could you dare...... You're mad, you are, get out, close the door! Yes! Ah, Sergey Fyodorov just missed that one, just al little, but he has the puckpasses and he misses" Come on, come on! Our boys are taking risksIts their game Come on, come on! You freaks....What are they doing? -I thought that someone promised to take care of this body... -Why, what am I doing to it? The body is in superb condition! For every 100 gram of extra weight, shell tear 100 grams out of your flesh. The lower one isn't working. -I said hello! -Hey little vampire! Yes! Yes! Attaboys! How good men are at inventing anything to avoid keeping their promises! Which promises? I was under the impression that you were taking me to a restaurant. But I thought it was forbidden.... I need your son. Kostya! -Hi Kostik! -Hi Let's go? -Whos that? -Dad! Did you by chance see Gorodetsky? We can't find him anywhere. That's a pity... We think he might have switched bodies...with a woman. People have strange preferences. Let's drink to you! I hope that you will soon get out of this predicament. Look, a Dark one! What kind of Dark one is that? That boy at VDNH, he must be very closely connected to you. You help him so much... Did they tell you to crack me? Yet again I must acknowledge that you are....an idiot! Going to suck some stranger's blood... Preparing some evil spells.... What do you want? Could you recognize him in a different body? Don't know, I never tried... For example, in mine? Are you married? Yes....you do have an unreal car... I have to go. -I'll be only a minute. -Dont confuse the doors. The one with the boy painted on it is not for you! yes yes yes.... Shit! I've been framed! Now they have direct evidence. I didn't kill, it was a coincidence! That's not coincidence, that's a provocation! But Anton wasn't there! You've been spotted long ago, you should have left the house! The main thing is that now they can do with you whatever they please! Why aren't we moving? Have you decided to play war now? Zavulon! -Im listening, Zavulon. -I accuse of murder the employee of Night Watch. Anton Gorodetsky. All right. I'll try to find him. -We'll take him now. -Hes not here! The one whom we suspect of the killings is in the body of that woman. You have no right to obstruct us! Why aren't you doing something? Why aren't YOU doing anything? We have no right to oppose them! If you break the Agreement, they will kill you!!! Number 22nd..... What the hell does the trolleybus have to do with it?......... Nooooooooooooooo....... Let's go! Let's go! (In a man's voice) Let's go! Artist, right? If, until dawn, you will not present evidence to prove the lack of involvement of Gorodetsky in the killing of the Dark ones... ....we will issue a permit for his annihilation. Such a request has already been made by the Day Watch. Here's a copy. We will not hand out our colleague. I am writing an official protest right now. If you will refuse to obey, war will begin. -This is a provocation of the Day Watch. -And in this war, the Great ones will not be on your side. The claims of the Day watch are sound. Your objections will be dismissed. (dials: GORSVET "City Light" Samarkand) -Olisher, it's Gorodetsky from Moscow. -Ah, Anton, hello! -How are you? -Not bad, Olisher, I 'm coming to you now. Could you arrange for me to visit Tamerlan's grave? And no one must know of it. Could you do that for me? -Hello? -I was talking to someone else. Of course you can come, we'll organize everything. Give my greetings to Semyon. Bye. (Dials "Zavulon") Salam aleikum. It's me. Some Korodetsky is flying over to us. Gorodetsky is going to Samarkand? Thank you Mahmoud. -So, I'm flying to Samarkand? -Wait. I'm afraid the plane won't make it. What do you mean? Hey, let the Parrot fly instead. All right. -Here. -And what is this? That's his ride. To the airport. (Dials "Anton") -Yes? -Olga? -How are you? -Bad. I need my body. Meet me in half an hour at the Domodedovo airport. -Let's walk. -No, let's take the elevator. I need my body. Going somewhere? Aha, give me my body back. -Why, aren't you happy with mine? -Sure, I'm just afraid I'll damage it. What do you mean?!!!! One second! What are you looking at? Come in! May be we should walk? -What's this? -That's a belt. That's a weapon. The purpose of your trip? The viewing of architectural monuments of the ancient capital of Uzbekistan. You know, I think I'm already running late. What do you want in Samarkand? -You have a return ticket for tomorrow morning! -Yes. And how many monuments are you going to visit during the night? One. -Wait! Dozing off at work! Excuse me, are we going to Samarkand? Thanks Where do you think you're going? -Sit down please -Yes, you must sit down in a plane -Miss, sit down please! -All right all right, you can pass. Do you have these... -Yes we have that brand of candy. Now sit down. -Thanks. -Still, I'm not letting you go anywhere. -You better strap in. "Tower, this is 593.Following instructions. We're ready for take-off." "593, permission for take-off, runway nr.2, conditions are good, cross wind strength 7" "I'm going up." If you'll open the grave, you'll start a war. You'll not fly anywhere! I'll be really careful, I'll only use my fingernail to lift it... No, we aren't flying. "What was that? Everything was fine!" We are flying! Nope, it's not working. People! -People! You all want to fly to Samarkand, don't you? -Yes yes! Everybody wants to fly, understood? Let's go! Commander, barrier ahead! Bloody hell (Russian: "pines and sticks") I haven't called for you. -Why aren't we doing anything? -Want some? -No Once a colleague of the Night Watch got into trouble. He breached the Agreement... ...and when his destruction already seemed imminent, this girl stood up for him, very actively But that's Olga! Afterwards he was acquitted of course, and the Inquisition took all the blame off him, but the sorceress.... -She didn't change a bit! -But the sorceress, whom we Light ones really needed then... ...was condemned What a sad story, Boris Ivanovitch... I was only the bait. The real target was She, a Great one There's no Chalk in Tamerlan's right hand. And how do you know? Were you there? In 1941. Boris got into big trouble then, I really needed the Chalk. I put the idea of an expedition into the archeologists' head, went with them In Samarkand an old man came to me. his name was Zoar. He told me that if we opened the grave, a war will start, but i was sure then... ...that when the Chalk would be in my hands, I'll be able to fix everything. When we opened the grave, on it there was an inscription: "I held the whole world in my right hand, but I can not take it with me." And there was no Chalk in his right hand And what was Zoar doing there? He worked in Gorkom (City Committee), something with ideology. -And in the Tamerlan's time? -Almost the same thing. He was his right hand. His right hand? So Zoar, you old son of a.... Olga? Turn the plane around. I know where the Chalk is. Zoar has it. "Cafe Zoar" Zoar, give me the Chalk. Here it is. -You didn't understand me. I need the magic Chalk. -This is the magic one. -And where do you write with it? -Right here, on this board. -And, does it help? -Every day. -So what shall I write? -Whatever you want. (writes "Yegor") But how...how did you end up here? I was just passing, and decided to drop by... Just passing by? Just passing! Passing by...Yegor, it worked, do you understand? It worked!! -What worked, daddy? -The Chalk worked! My dearest boy! But why are you so cold? Why've you become so cold? Did you freeze? Will you eat? We'll make you something. Zoar come on, make us something, my son has been born today! It worked! -Come on, let's wash your trousers as well. -And what will I wear? Why, where were you going so late in the evening? Come on, come on.. -Leave it Kostya! -I'll wash them! Oh, I'm so sorry. I....I'm looking for your neighbor. And you're not the only one. Thank you. Be careful, Svetlana. You're a vampire?! Here, look! -Please forgive him! We're not breaking any rules... -I am not accusing you of anything. All the products in the fridge ...are legal... -Milk, cheese, potatoes.... -Father, stop! Stop degrading yourself! -Hello? -Hello, Anton? -Who is this? It's me, Svetlana. Svetlana, you know that he has a family, a child. Please, don't call him anymore. Here, this is pilaf, a rice dish. You eat it with your hands. Is it good? Will youwill you come eat with us? -Who is "us"? -Me, mom... Yegor, I can't come with you....I have this other...life Yegor, you understand, I.... You will come out of your own will!!! Zoar, why didn't the Chalk work? I did write where you told me to. Here I write my own destiny. The pilaf is 150 roubles. And your destiny is somewhere else. But you can never change someone else's destiny. Everyone is solely responsible for his own. Remember? Remember where you broke your destiny? Why didn't you tell me at once? -You didn't ask. -Didn't ask.... Forgive me Anton-djan. What happened? He stole the Chalk! Hello? What are you, crazy? It's one o'clock in the morning, he's long asleep. Hey, boss, to VDNH! -We found him, Zavulon! -Crush him! You idiot! I need him alive! Chase him around a bit, boys. Anton! What's going on here? Anton? Zoar! Nobody's here! -Right, is this his telephone? -Why is it smashed? It means that the Dark ones are also looking for the Chalk...That means the big game has just started. What the hell are you doing? What station is this? I'm off. Guys, what the hell....Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Who did you talk to? I don't know, but he told me never to call him again. -It was Yegor. -Why did he come? He stole the Chalk from him. -Where to? -I'll just be a minute. -Do you remember Yegor's address? -Yes, VDNH metro station. -Let's go. -Let's go. Get her. Sveta? Sveta? Down the toilet. What, did you get in to warm up? -Anywhere. -Understood. Uncle Zavulon? Why are we actually Dark? Darkness hides the imperfections, Yegor. And there are no people without imperfections. It allows us to do whatever we want. It allows us to be who we are. It gives us...love. Here, look what I found, uncle Zavulon. It's the Chalk of Destiny. -Hello. -Zavulon? -Speaking. -Do you have the Chalk? -No. -You have no right to touch it. -I'm not touching it. What kind of gathering are you having there? -Don't you want to invite me? -No. I'll send you the photographs. Right, step on the breaks. Gather everyone at the KOSMOS hotel. And where are you going, Boris Ivanovitch? I need to change my clothes. Alice? -You can fix mistakes with it. -So keep it. -So what about you? -I don't need it. -Why, don't you make mistakes? -I do, but I never regret them. -So what shall I do with it? -You could give it to Alice. And what does she regret? What do women regret? Matters of love. Are you sure about this? I don't want to be like you. To be afraid of strangers and of neighbors. To be scared of every phone call. Why? I, for example, am not scared of anything. Even in our position we can stay human. Human, dad? May be you can make me a human being? No, but....listen! Oi, my son, listen! Alice, will you be here shortly? We're starting. And don't touch the ring, it hurts me. (Writes "Kostya"on the wall) Why have you come? Why, is it forbidden? No, it's allowed. Close the door. -Hi. -Hi. I've come for you. Coming! -Good evening! -Come back later. Kostya, wait! It's ok. No, wait, I'll explain everything to you! He knows everything about me, I can't do anything, I have feelings, do you understand? -I can't take it off. -Shall I help? -Don't. He'll kill you. -I'm not scared. I am. Didn't I ask to come back later? Didn't I say... Come on, let's go! -And who might that be? -That's the Gorodetsky's neighbor, he knows him... Aha...So where's your daddy? Eh..... The telephone subscriber...is temporarily unavailable. Does that hurt? Come on, come on.... You don't have the right! You are an outlaw! An outlaw, get it? -You are an outlaw! Understand, it's nothing personal, I was ordered... -Agreed, agreed.... I was ordered...Gosha is a good boy...Gosha was going to KOSMOS, to that boy's birthday party! Why, what have you thought of? What did you think of? No, you'll never get away with it! They know your ugly face on every corner! Of course, these are not our work methods... -Where are they celebrating a boy's birthday? -Last floor, take the elevator. -Kolya, the parrot is coming up. -Right. -How is it in there? -Ok. Go quickly, or you'll be late. -Victor, wait, give me your jacket! Hi Victor! Have they started? Who told you I'm Victor? (Badge says: Victor, security) So you are not Victor? Then where's Victor? Yegor! Yegor! Yegor! Yegor! Who's there? Yegor! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Quiet, quiet, let the father say a word! It's his birthday, or did you forget? Sing him the drinking song! Come on, say something. You know, he was really waiting for you. What is it? You Light ones are supposed to be good at this! I...... I...wish you health and happiness, Yegor. Is that it? And also, I wish everything to be well with you. I'll tell you everything later, Yegor. Let's get out of here. No, tell it to me now. Later will be too late. I wish you only one thing. I wish you to learn to forgive. -And whatever you... -Bravo! Your dad is tired. Forgive him, won't you? They've poisoned him. -Could I go to the right? "The one to the left on the parallel lane, detain him as understood." -Let me go to the right! That's the way things have turned out, sonny. Here, take a bite! What is this? Why, do you need the list of ingredients or the effect? -You ruined my life, grandma! -And you ruined mine! -Me? -Yes. You are responsible for me having to sit as a toad in some corner for the last 12 years! -And what shall you and I do now? -Have you forgotten why you came here, you old sock ? (Echo sounds like "chalk, chalk...") Chalk, you say? "Don't use your hands, or you'll be disqualified. Hold the balls between your backs!" But they destroyed your little witch hut! Destroyed it, but left one wall. Hey you, come here! A grape, do you want a grape? Here. No? If you'll fetch the Chalk, I'll give it to you, ok? She doesn't take food from strangers. A trained one , eh? Doesn't eat? Doesn't eat. -But I do! -That's a good boy! -I eat everything! -Good boy! Now I'll go and swallow.... (Sings an old soviet pioneers' song about victory over dark forces) He's near, I feel it Bloody hell! What's going on here? Are you happy now? You moron! -Here! -Stop it Semyon, control yourself! (Folk song plays: Instead of grieving, Ill dance!) (Nobody loves me, nobody's nice to me, I'm going to the garden and I'm going to eat some worms) (The worms are magical and have all kinds of colors, I'll just put them in my mouth and chew in silence..... Instead of grieving, Ill dance!) (My eyebrows are black as the night, my eyes are hazel, I'm so pretty on top and all right below..... If you don't love me, if you're not nice to me, then piss off to the garden and go and eat some worms!) -Shall I call the Inquisition? -Don't rush it, our company is not yet complete. -Let's have a drink... -All right, let's... -Let's drink our brotherhood! -Don't play games with me, Gorodetsky, or I'll hand you over to the Inquisition... Me, to the Inquisition? What for? I didn't kill them...... You know that.... And who did kill them then? Why, its just like in the detective novels: some gardener... Or butcher.... Valery Sergeyevitch! -What brings you here? -I came to get my son. -He's come for his son as well!!! They issued a license for Kostya... Congratulations! You know that he's not like that.... Not like what? Harmless...takes after his mother...really good young man... I think he totally takes after his father... Who, gentlemen Dark ones? Do you know who killed Galina Rogova? She was killed by... She was killed by Killed by... Why would I kill her? Good question. Why? Why did they have to be killed? Hey, do you know who put him up to this? Dad! With exactly that same weapon.... I wanted you to be human so much! No circumstances can justify breaching the Great Agreement. Do you acknowledge your guilt? Yes, I acknowledge it. Say your goodbyes. This is how it has to be. The Inquisition lifts the accusation from Anton Gorodetsky's head. You are free to go. Thank you, but I'm having a good time here. -Dad! -I'll explain it all to you! Did YOU call them? -Me? -Zavulon, you promised! Go, father, don't disturb our ....celebration. He wouldn't do this by himself, someone put him up to this! He was instructed by HIM.... Tango! Right... Calm down....Give me the Chalk... Get away, you scum! Someone loses....and someone finds... Someone departsand someone arrives... She has come. Now we are complete. Stop her, uncle Zavulon. She cannot be stopped anymore. -And killed? -Melodrama is not my style. Then I'll do it myself. -She's stronger than you, think about that. -Don't even think about that! -Sveta dear, you go home ok? -Anton! -Sveta dear, you go home ok? I'll explain everything to you later! Please go home! Don't be angry.... I'm fine Go home please... See, uncle Zavulon, he doesn't love her anymore. He's become Dark! No, my dear Yegor, he's hiding something. -So what do we do? -Think Yegor, think. Yesterday, in the Twilight, I stuck a needle into her. Now I can drink her. -320th, seven minutes; -34th, six minutes; -540th; -518th; -118th, one minute to target; No starting without us, everyone hold their positions; I repeat, everyone hold their positions! Are they surrounding us or what? (Dials "Svetlana") She isn't answering. ("Olga is calling") Sveta! Sveta, it's me, keep looking at me! The main thing is not to close your eyes, you hear me? Otherwise I will lose you! I'm losing you! Calm down, that's right, help me, come on, we'll get out of there in a minute..... Come on, breathe, breathe! Now get up, get up... Sveta, speak to me, speak to me, tell me what's going on... Crazy bastards... Good girl, keep breathing, now get up, very good, You are our beauty, Sveta, a beauty! Come on, come on, stand up! -Sveta? -Yes, hello! Hello...Olga? -Yes, we're coming, wait for us! -I found Anton! He's drunk and won't go anywhere. Go practice a bit. What do you mean, poisoned? You have to get out of there, it's a trap, a provocation! And you must especially avoid any confrontations with Yegor, do you hear? -I do. -Do you hear me? -Yes, I do. Who are you looking for? -I need Anton Gorodetsky. -I need him too. -I only need to talk to him! -No, you're lying! You've come to take him away from me, haven't you? No. It's you he loves. And you. And now, ladies and gentlemen, The time has come for the main event of our celebration, The one we have been wating for, as they say, a thousand years! Today a Great one has appeared in our midst! I will not fight with you. You don't have a choice. Put on your seatbelt. We'll start a battle, and this time we shall win! That's a big motherfer. But if even a drop of blood of a Dark one shall be spilt, I will tear up the Agreement! And then we shall start a battle and we will win! What? We've arrived. .....What's the deal, guys! We know the faces of every one of them! Their dark, ugly, disgusting faces! The normal people believe in us! Who except us will help them? ...Because no one has the power to fix anything anymore! Because we hold Destiny in our hands! -To arms! Let's go! -Stop! Everyone! This is a provocation! And there shall be Darkness! And nothing will be able to stand in its way! Won't they object to this? -All right, I'll go. -Just try to. What is with you? -That's it. -What is it? -It has begun. I didn't mean to... -Let's go? -What about Geser? -Let's go!!!! Leave this floor immediately, don't panic, this is an emergency evacuation, there's a fire on this floor! Get out! All of you! Fire, get out everyone! What happened? Fire! Fire! We're getting out, come on! -Fire! Get out! -Miss, what happened? Anton! ...All these people are trying to save themselves.... They're coming back... There's a fire on your floor, be calm, quickly... -Young man, what's going on? -Fire! -I'm flying already! -Are you filming? -It's dark... -The end of the world.... May be they'll give us some more time? Stepan! Find Alice, take the Chalk from her! -Where's Alice? -Alice? There I think. Alice! Alice, wait! What am I, a kid, do I have to run everywhere after you? -What do you think you're doing? -Stop! -Stop! Keep your eyes on me! Go! -I'll just be a minute.... Be quiet.... Stop! Wait! So, will you show me where Alice is? Yes? All right. Come on. Lead me to her. (Writes "Kostya lives" on the wall) -Kostya! Give it to me, come on! No! -You scum! Get away! -You can't get him back anyway anymore! -I'll fix everything! -You won't be able to fix a thing! It's a lie! -Why not? -Because you're not guilty of anything! Give me the Chalk! -Whose fault is it then? -Who cares, who cares? It's all MY fault... -Anton! Anton!They've... -Wait -I'll get you home, Sveta... -Anton, I can't see a thing... -Let him go!Let go! -Hold on to me Anton! -I won't give him to you! Do you hear? I won't give him to you! Anton, hold me! The glass! The glass! The glass is falling! What have you done, Anton? But Ifound...the Chalk, Boris Ivanovitch... -The house was demolished. -Yes, but there was a wall left... Good bye Anton. Now run. Run quickly. -You see, this camera has a short time exposure. -Thank you, Boris Ivanovitch. (Writes "NO" on the wall) "Moscow, the year 1992" -So, what do you think? Do we have a deal? Well... NO. I'll deal with it myself somehow. In a human way. Forgive me please. Well, where nothing is, nothing can be had. Do you have a smoke? -No? -No, I don't smoke. -He didn't recognize you. -So what happens now? - Nothing. He's become a human being. -He won't recognize her. -He will. -Don't you help him. -And you don't interfere. It wasn't fate. -Young lady! -It WAS fate! Forgive me please, but...could we have seen each other somewhere before? -May be we could have. -Really? "A Timur Bekmambetov film" (All around Semyon the billboards have turned to film titles) What the....? Surrounded me... Look at them.... Stylists.... Well done...
