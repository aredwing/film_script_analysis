Um, thank you, Mr. Stumpwater. And now, if the family will please join me in the study For the reading of the will. Last but not least, to my grandson, Mickey Matson. Mr. Mickey Matson, I presume. Stalwert priggish iii. The lawyer said my grandpa left something for me. Oh, that is correct. This way, please. Uh. Your grandfather must have had a lot of faith in you, my boy. This is the one. Grandpa left you a stinking rock. Priceless. Wait till everyone at school hears about this. Dork boy gets a rock. Crazy old gramps. Mickey! Mickey, come back. I don't get it, gramps. What did I do to deserve a stupid rock? I thought I was your favorite. This kite is out of control! Then I don't love you either. Oh! Smooth, ace. Nice kite work. Where'd you learn to drive that thing? Sorry. I was trying to miss you. Anything broken? Just your kite. You may not be as bright as he thought you were. What? Let me ask you a question. Do you think Jack Bettys Would've kept a rock locked up in a safety deposit box, Just so you could throw the dang thing into lake Michigan? It's just a stupid rock. I told you he wasn't ready, jack! Kids these days just play them dang video majiggers. No sense of duty, And sure as heck no common sense. You know this old creeper? I told your grandpa I'd get you started, But I didn't have to plan on having to fish this out of water Right after you got the thing. Were you talking to my grandpa? Yeah! And hopefully he's talking to the big guy upstairs, Pull a couple favors for you. 'Cause you gonna need 'em. Still look like a worthless rock to you? What are you looking at? I don't know. It's some sort of pattern. Looks like a Petoskey stone to me. They're only found in this part of the state. No, but there's more to it. It looks like... Hey, what about my kite? Wow. That looks really old. What are you doing on my roof? I came to collect... For the damages to my kite. What? You almost killed me. Well, if you hadn't been in the way, My brand-New kite wouldn't be in a billion pieces. And I wouldn't be bored out of my crackin' mind In this miserable little town, pal. Umm... crackin'? BigCity word. Right. Um... So did you just move here? Nah, just staying at gram's for the weekend. My parents are on a trip. So where'd you get the microscope? My grandpa. The last thing he gave me before he died. I'm sorry. That's sad. What's your name? Mickey. Mickey Matson. Sully Braginton. Nice to meet you, sully. Sorry about your kite. No worries. So what's up with the rock? Not sure. Gramps left it for me. He left you a rock? That's what I thought, Until Mr. Stumpwater pulled it out of the lake. I saw something. I-I just need a little water. Oh. Here you go. Thanks. I-I can't believe it. What is it? It's... It's a map. You're kidding, right? No, it's a map. Crackin' awesome. You best be hurrying up, now, boy. Come on, now! We best be going! I would not do that if I was you, yank. Hey, hey, hey, that's enough now. I'll play patty-Cake with him later. - You're not very nice. - I know. My mama used to call it "ornery." Now, back on up. Well, I just want to thank you all For your fine northern hospitality. Hey, darling, why don't you give me a call sometime? Ladies and gentlemen, listen up and listen good. South gonna rise again. Hear me. The south gonna rise again! Whoo, yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! Ding! You're right. It does look like a map of north bay. But do you have any idea what we're looking for? No. I don't. Maybe he wanted it to be like a challenge. You know, like a riddle or something. Sounds like something he would do. He used to tell me all the time That there are things worth doing, And those things were always worth doing right, No matter what. That usually means it won't be easy. So let's recap. Your grandpa gets sick, doesn't tell anyone, And when he dies, He leaves you a rock with a hidden map on it That apparently leads to nothing. We have to be missing something. You forgot about the microscope. Right. So he had everything planned out Until he decided to stump you with the map. Wait a minute. Stump. That's it. Whoa, there, partner. The north arrow on the map, I've seen this before. A hidden symbol. Tricky. Maybe my grandpa wasn't crazy. There's no way we are going to make ends meet this month. I'm actually thinking of cashing in my coin collection. Honey, we'll make it. Priggish has foreclosed on three other families This month alone, And we were out wasting gas money looking for Mickey. Maybe it's time for you to go. Yeah, I'll split. But what about the symbol? It's way out in coffer woods. My parents wouldn't let me go. Well, grams lives out on the end of lily lane, Just in case you change your mind. We drove around for over three hours looking for you. Mickey, we know you're upset, But we were really worried. You can't just take off like that. I'm sorry. Why didn't he tell us he was sick? We don't know. But I do know that he loved you so much. I just wish I could've said good-Bye. We all do. He'd want you to remember the good times you two had together. Can I go to my room now? Hang up your good clothes, honey. I don't know what your father was thinking Giving him that stone. He thought he was ready. Ready for what? To run off on some wild goose chase of his? He's still a little boy. I don't even think he's ready for junior high. He lost his grandfather. He doesn't need to be disappointed by him too. Ready? Oh, yeah, I'm ready. Set. Go. Hey, you're getting faster. Try again. I'll never be as fast as you. Oh, you'll be even faster. This knot will come in handy someday. It's a strong knot. Won't slip. Did you use it in the coast guard? Oh, almost every day. Got me out of a lot of tight spots. This is for you. It's been used for quite a while. I've just been looking after it for you. Grandpa, I can't take this from you. I know you'll take good care of it. It doesn't keep time very well, So... Be sure you keep winding it. But it will always point you In the right direction. See here. You point the hour hand towards the sun. You place a blade of grass on across the face of the watch, Right between the hour hand and 12:00. The grass points north and south. That's so cool! Love you, gramps. Love you too, Mickey. I'm sorry. I can't do this. Don't you touch them raisinets, boy. You want me to give you another whupping? Ah! Eat your dang prune Danish. You know the general puts it out for you for regularity. Boy, you need help, I'll tell ya. That gas you had last night was disgusting. You keep eating cherries and candy like that, You'll get fat, fat, fat. You won't even be able to ride your hog. You might have made a less noticeable entrance into town. I heard you coming from a mile away. Yes, general. We need not raise eyebrows. One of the elements has surfaced. The Petoskey stone. Well, where is it? It was bestowed to a runt of a boy. Who's gonna give it to a kid? Jack Bettys. Ugh. He must've been desperate. Now, I don't think the boy is even properly trained. Well, if he's just a kid, Why don't we just go snatch it from him? No, no, no, no, no. We will be patient. And when the time is right, We will reclaim what is rightfully ours. And our glorious flag will fly proudly across this community And every other around the nation. Not a normal breakfast. Nope. It's lunch. Taking a friend on a bike ride... To coffer woods. Coffer woods? Mickey, that's too far. You know... No, it's not too far. I'm not a little kid anymore. So this friend, Would it be the girl that was climbing down our porch When we got home last night? Yeah. Sully. She's staying with her grams this weekend. Mickey, about yesterday. There's something that you need to know about your grandpa. There was a good reason That grandpa jack gave me that rock. I just have to figure out what it is. Hand me the pliers, sully. Get this up, and it'll be running smooth like pudding. I didn't think you'd show. Morning, Mickey. Good morning. Sorry to hear about your grandpa. Jack and I were good friends. Thanks. Um, we should get going. It's a little bit of a ride. See you, grams. Bye. Have fun. Bye! We're getting close. Just a few more miles. Miles? Seriously? Things are a lot closer in the city. Watch the roots. It gets a little bumpy. What did he leave you that was so important He had to make it this hard to find? I don't know. I was in the, like, third grade When grandpa jack brought me here for the first time. Wow. I've never seen a stump this big before. I know it's here somewhere. What do you think it means? Wait. This symbol's different. The one on the map had an "n" in the middle of the triangle. Yeah, you're right. "37"? 37 what? Well... The other symbol on the map had a north arrow, So if we, like, combine the two together, We get 37 north. Paces, like for buried treasure. 37 paces. But which way is north? Okay, so how is a pocket watch going to help us? We need a compass. Well, grandpa jack taught me how to use a pocket watch As a compass. Of course. You just point the hour hand at the sun And put a blade of grass on the face of the watch And put it right in between 12:00 and the hour hand, And then the blade of grass should point south and north. That's amazing. He said it would always keep me pointed In the right direction. One... Two, three, four, Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14... 35, 36, 37. So now we dig, right? I guess so. Hey, the ground looks soft here. I see something. I haven't seen this one before. It's some sort of geometric shape. So open it already. What is that? A picture. An old one. With some letters. "I-H-H-U-E." Looks like an old-Time photo Of a barn being built or something. Yeah, with a bunch of numbers. Lotto numbers? Who knows. And an old key. I have to be honest. Not really what I was hoping for. You wanted it to be gold or something? Jewels would've been... Ah! So you're Matson, hey? Ah, look at you. Scrawnier than I expected. I told him this weren't no mission for a kid. And I'm sure he didn't expected ya To have a little girl tagging along. Watch it, fur face. I'm from Chicago. - Sully... - This ain't a joke, girly! And you ain't cut out for this. Now, you take your little friend from Chicago here And head back to town Before you get hurt! And if people come looking for you, Tell 'em what they want to know. Maybe you'll survive. Survive? Uh, let's back the truck up here. I don't know what your granddaddy was thinking, Trusting this to a boy. Now, the two of you get out of here. Get. Now! Don't you ever come back, ever! You hear me? Now, Jeremiah, this ain't gonna agree with you. Hmm? Why you do this all the time, huh? You know I'm gonna be up all night with you Giving you that pink stuff, And you know how we both hate that. Yeah. Don't you growl at me. And why you drinking water out of a flower vase? I mean, ain't you never heard of "etiquit"? Huh? Wh... Boys, please. I think it's time we had a discussion with an old friend. Ivan Stumpwater followed the boy to the beach. I think it's more than coincidence. Do you have any idea what the symbols mean? Nope. But I think I know who can help us. We need to check the fishery reports. Mr. Stumpwater? Hello? Um, okay. Weird. Mr. Stumpwater? Gross. Ah. Shell's good for ginger's cold. I meant the stuff in the pan. I found the map... In the rock. Uh, Petoskey stone. One of a kind. Told you it was a Petoskey stone. Well, it led us to another clue. And a guy who hasn't showered in a while. Ooh, Buckshot Plindenberg. He's still around, huh? Yeah. We were wondering if he's, You know... All there. Ah, never has been. I knew it. But if he put the fear of god in you, It's for good reason. Coffee? I'm not allowed to drink coffee. Me either. Make mine a double. Well... Did he, um... Tell you about the symbols? That is terrible. Is that even coffee? Sully. No, he didn't say anything about the symbols. - Hmm. - Do you know what they are? What exactly do you know about your granddaddy? I know that he was in the coast guard, And when he retired, He moved home and bought the museum. There are tales of an ancient process. Some call it science. Some call it magic. It's called alchemy. Alchemy. I've heard of it. I think. What is it? It was developed by ancient mystics As a way of turning any object into silver. Those symbols you've been following from your granddaddy, They're part of the alchemy process. You know eating that Is why you smell the way you do, right? Mmm. Mm-Hmm. Yeah. So what'd you find out in coffer woods? This key And an old picture Of what looks like a barn being built With some letters on it. There's a bunch of numbers on the back too. Yeah. Ah. Oh, yeah. He had buckets of faith in you. Mr. Stumpwater, please. We're just asking you for a little help. What is all this about? What I do know is that there are three powerful objects That are used in the alchemy process. Your granddaddy's been protecting these items For many years, But now they're in danger of falling into the wrong hands. What wrong hands? Ooh, some of the nastiest people You will ever meet in your life. So... We're supposed to find these objects to protect them? Now, I'm sorry this has to fall on you, boy. But at all cost, You must find these elements before they do. Your granddaddy, He saw a nobility in your heart. He chose you. But this sounds like something that he should've left For my mom and dad. Ah. You could tell my parents. Ah, who'd believe the rants Of a crazy, old bait shop owner? No. Who, indeed. Ivan, what are on earth are you filling these children's heads With all these fairy tales for? You and your boys, get out of here. We're closed. Oh, we will, once we get what we came for. Mr. Matson, we'd like to alleviate you Of the burden of finding all those pesky items Mr. Stumpwater told you about. Now, I'll be glad to pay you. Why don't you just turn over everything you've found Up to this point? Why, name your price, boy. Why, I know your family can use the money. Now, what are they, Nearly three months behind on their mortgage? Mm-Mm. I don't think any of this is for sale, Mr. Priggish. Everything has a price. Now, think about this: You could save your family's home. You could be a hero. I don't think you appreciate The gravity of your situation, Mr. Matson. This is your final chance. We'll make it easy. My grandpa taught me that doing the right thing Usually isn't easy. I hope your grandpa was right about you, boy. Ah! I'm from Chicago. I like a little spice with my eggs. Ah! How about a little cleanup, huh? Copperhead. Ha-Ha! Peekaboo. Ah! Ah! - Go, go, go, go! - Mickey. Grams! Now, run, boy! I said, run, boy! Stop him, Billy! Stop him! Get in! We got to burn rubber! Tie up Mr. Stumpwater. The bait shop owner May have just become bait himself. Who were those guys? Did you see those tattoos? No. What tattoos? Yeah, skull and bones. UhHuh. And a bowie knife with a six-Shooter. And a snake. Copperheads. What? Copperheads? Shouldn't we call the police or something? They have stumpwater! Do you think stalwert is gonna let those police arrest him? Honey, he's bought and paid for those townie police potlickers Three times over. What's a copperhead? Let's get inside. Now, this might be a little bit much for you kids, So try to keep up. You keep something hidden in a box of freezer wrap? Cool. Now, pay attention. Back during the civil war, President Abraham Lincoln formed a special forces unit Known as the secret order of the patriot. No way. This elite group of soldiers had only one mission, A mission could change the course of this country, And maybe even the world. These patriots were to sneak Into the heart of the confederate stronghold Without being detected And secure three mystical elements That powered a fabled mechanism From ancient times... The alchemy machine. But the the order was found out. We lost our first leader that day, But the others were able to fight their way Out of the forest And protect the elements, All the way back here, Where the secret order of the patriot Has kept them safe for generations. So this is the alchemy machine? Anything passed through the portal When the elements are in place Will be turned into silver. How did the jerks from the bait shop fit into this? They're part of a powerful group of men Who don't believe the civil war ever ended. And those goons at the bait shop... they're field soldiers: Copperheads. What about priggish? He's the general. Somehow they tracked the elements back here And have been lying in wait for years For the opportunity to take 'em back. And priggish, He wants to take control of the country. And to set an example, He plans to steamroller this community. And they want to use the alchemy machine To do that somehow? But how would they use it? I mean, it isn't a weapon. Is it? Power isn't having the biggest army or the most weapons. It's having control of a country's wealth. And priggish knows how to control money. What are the three elements? I mean, do we even know what we're looking for? No. Only your grandpa jack knew. And, uh, they're not written down in the blueprints either. We can't just leave Mr. Stumpwater. We have to save him from those guys. You two let me worry about old stumpwater. Now, where's that clue that you found? Hmm. This code on the back Could be like a Caesar shift of some sort. Hmm. Now, this I may be able to help you with. Look familiar? I didn't even see it. It was right there. You know where you're going? Sure do. Then let's head out back and get you kids some wheels. Watch your step. Oh, I've been looking for that. This one here is a Jim-Dandy. Whoa. I'm driving. I don't think so. Hey, this is pretty awesome, isn't it? My gracious southern hospitality Is running out, Mr. Stumpwater. Now, who was the old lady in the truck? I'm not sure who you're talking about, priggish. But if it's one of our patriots, They'll defend those kids and the elements to the last breath. Well, if that's what it takes, It can be arranged. I could use a bite to eat. How about you run and fetch me some fish and chips? We know the boy has the stone. Where are the other elements? Where? Don't forget the tartar sauce. No. Hit him. This was grandpa jack's favorite place In the whole world. It doesn't work. You okay? Yeah. Just didn't see that small cannon. Oh, it's a lyle gun. A what? A lyle gun. It fires a projectile with a rope attached to it. It was used to save people from shipwrecks. Cool. Bad place for it, though. Bet you didn't expect all this When your parents had to go out of town. They're not on a trip. They're fighting. Maybe getting a divorce. Sorry. It's all good. Maybe I'll just stay here with grams Until they figure it out. Well, I don't think I could be doing any of this without you. So what are we looking for? Not sure. What's back there? That's my grandpa's desk. Hey, that's another symbol. This antikythera thing. I think I've heard of this before, Maybe in, like, history class or something. Grandpa jack and I talked about this once. What is it? Nobody knows what this thing really did, But they know it was, like, crazy advanced For when it was made. Whoa. "Nw 3 plus 7." So just like the tree stump. Northwest, ten paces. The compass thing only works outside. But, like, lake Michigan's that way, Which is west, So northwest has got to be that way. Two, three, four, Five, six, Seven, eight, nine, ten. What's that? "To this man, much is owed. "He gave his life to save us, "We, the people, from evil forces. "Appointed to lead by the honest one, He did not fail in his mission and shall never be forgotten." Look at the "s" in "this." It's capitalized. And the "o" in "owed." And "people." "S.O.P." Secret order of the patriot. "Appointed to lead by the honest one." Honest Abe. Lincoln. James fowler. He must've been the commander of the mission That grams was telling us about. The leader that didn't survive. What's this string? Duck! Holy shish kebabers! Was your grandpa trying to kill us? Oak grove cemetery. Perfect. A creepy graveyard. Just what I was hoping for. We better grab some gear. Of course. The gate is closed. Must be after 5:00. Yep. Are we looking for the last symbol from the museum? Could be. Maybe on a headstone? Oh, my gosh. I'm seriously so out of my comfort zone. I mean, I don't even think we have cemeteries in the city. Sully, look. Fowler. The secret order of the patriot leader. Are we really going to break into a dead guy's house thing? I guess we're gonna have to. I'm not ready to see dead people. It's the live ones you have to worry about. You grave robbers always scream, And it just... It scares me every time. And you could've done a better job of hiding your motorbike. Maybe not parked it in front of the gate. Or waited till dark. I'm guessing it's your first time robbing graves. We aren't grave robbers. No? Just here visiting departed family members? With a shovel sticking out of your pack after hours? He... He's got us there. But, no... No... I don't want to hear it. Get out of here. About-Face and march, Before I call the police and have you arrested! Now move it! And don't let me catch you in here again, you hear me? Or I'll have you thrown in jail. Well, that didn't go as planned. I want you to take the motorbike And drive it around the block. What? Look, we need to find those elements. I'm allergic to jail. That's why I want you to wait with the bike. I get caught, You can go meet up with grams and try and save Ivan. Are you sure, Mickey? This is getting serious. I have to do this. Don't break a leg. Hope you got my back, gramps. Whoa. Numbers. - Hey. - Whoa! You were supposed to wait by the bike. II know. I... It's really creepy in the woods alone. I thought you might need a hand. Here, read these numbers for me. Three. Seven. Two. One. Zero. Nine. Three. We need some leverage. I warned you not to come back here. Now you got troubles. Stop! We're trying to save our friend. Well, if he's in there, You're too late. No, not... Look, when my grandpa died, He left us some clues, And they've lead us here. And we need to find out what's inside of there To save our friend. And what is this clue he left ya? It's pretty complicated. Try me. This picture, it has a series of numbers on the back, Same as the number of keyholes on that lock. And who was your grandpa? Jack. Jack Bettys. You're telling stories, lad? No, he isn't. He died just a few days ago. Jack was a good man. Prepared the grounds for him yesterday. Sometimes these durn locks Just need a little encouragement. Ooh, Martha! Whoo. Well, I think my work is done here. Lock 'er up when you're done. Uh, and I was never here. Looks like a civil war chest to me. Or a little coffin. It might be our next symbol. Whoa. So you look through it, Like a microscope? My... My grandpa had one of these at the museum. Whoa, it looks like the same photo. Yeah, but with different letters. "L-G-T-O-S." Mean anything to you? No. There's a note on the back. "It has illuminated the path home "For many a lost soul. "When you attain this, "You will have all of the elements. "I believe in you. Grandpa jack." But we haven't found any of the elements yet. Wait, can I see that other photo? Perfect fit. II think I remember what this is. Can I borrow your hair clip? It's an old 3-D picture thing. Awesome. Check it out. It's not a barn being built. Nope. It's the lighthouse. Ivan! Ivan! Ivan! "Bring us the elements, Or stumpwater swims with the fishes"? Ivan! Ginger! What'd they do to the babe? Come on, honey. Let's go teach those potlickers Just how they should treat a lady. Where in tarnation have you two been? What happened at the museum? We found the next clue. It lead us to James fowler's tomb at the cemetery. I'm sorry to tell you this, kids, But we are running out of time. I just got a note that if we don't turn the elements over, Ivan's gonna be singing in heaven with your grandpa jack. Come on. Let's go in. I'm sure he's fine. He's never been this late before. Well, he's never been to coffer woods before. What? Where? Coffer woods. For a bike ride. There are miles of trails out there. We should've talked about this. He... He could get lost. He is not ready for this kind of a trip. He was ready. And, besides, have you ever known Mickey to be lost? Okay, so I'm a little lost. What do all these symbols mean? I have no idea. We need a key. Are you sure my grandpa jack didn't leave you anything else That could maybe help us with this? No. He gave me a cookbook. And I can't even boil water. We need that cookbook. Okay. Clues, clues. Apples, peaches, pumpkin pie. Tarnation! What is it? Whoa. Symbols. And their meanings. Hey, I found one. This one means "silver." The symbol from the stump. This one means... "Petoskey stone." This must be one of the elements. And we thought it was just a map. Explains why grandpa had it in his safety deposit box. And why stumpwater was so upset When you going to throw it into the lake. Oh, my gosh. The article from the museum. The antikythera thing. It's in the museum somewhere. It's one of the elements. How did we miss it? Oh, I've been in that place. It's a wonder you ever found your way out. This one means... "Sapphire of Sudan." Now, I know we don't have that. It's what the last clue leads to. Do you know where it is? The lighthouse. "Fire of rotation"? I've seen this one before. And so have you. What? The three elements. And the alchemy machine. It must all work like a recipe. A recipe for disaster. All right, you two get to the lighthouse And find the sapphire. I'll go to the museum And find that antikythera gizmo thing. I'm driving. About time. That old man's tougher than gator hide. 'Cause he had to hurt my hand. What? This is why mama never let him talk at home. She said, "Billy lee, you got all the brains And all the looks." The alchemy machine is nearly finished. Now, bring me those elements! Yes, sir. Come on, Jeremiah. Do you think the alchemy machine would really work? My grandpa wasn't crazy. No way would he have tried so hard to protect the elements. Well, he definitely made the right decision In picking you for the job. I hope you're right. "It has illuminated the path home for many a lost soul." Well, there's nothing down here. Maybe upstairs? You scared of heights? Me too. There's nothing up here. So then where's the sapphire? Man, that thing is bright. It's beautiful. No wonder it's so bright. And all he had to do was look at the light To make sure it was safe. Genius. He could see it from just about anywhere in town. Uh, Mickey? Short fatty and the muscle are here. The sapphire of Sudan. Don't hit me. Let's get the sapphire and get out of here. Come on. We have to make it down to the upper runway. UhOh. How do you do, kiddies? We got to go, sully. It's rusted. Gotcha, little piggy. Back off, copperhead! UhOh. Nice swing, slugger. You should play for the tigers. Dude, Chicago. One more pull. Now y'all gone and done ruffle my tail feathers! Let's go, sully. Billy? Dead end. Now what? Strong knot. It won't slip. I don't know if I've properly introduced you to... My Arkansas toothpick. You ready? Let's do it. Ah! Ahh! Come on, muscle brain. I'm not afraid of you. Sully, no! Let me go, you lunk-Head. Let her go! Well, give him the sapphire, and he will! Which one? Okay. Let her go, and I'll give you the sapphire. Sapphire first. Go! Go, go, go! YeeHaw! Kids. I got it, Billy. I got the sapphire, Billy. I got the sapphire! What is that? Uh... it looks like salami, Black forest ham, and Swiss cheese. Yep. Give me that. We gonna turn your heads! You hear me? No one messes with us copperheads And lives to tell the tale! You hear me? How many times have I looked out at that lighthouse? I never would've thought. Now that's good coffee. Whoa, young lady. Thank you. You didn't have to go after him alone. You could've waited for me. You were saving the sapphire. Yeah, which they almost got, thanks to you. What? Why did you go after him? What are you trying to prove? I've been trying to help you. Yeah, well, you don't... Well, who put you in charge? That's not helping one bit. The last thing we need is for the two of you To go acting like a couple of bull calves. We've got to stick together. This is exactly what priggish would want, Our team ripping each other apart. I'm sorry, sully. It's just that... My grandpa trusted me with this. And no one ever thought I could even tie my own shoes. I can't mess this up. I would've given them the sapphire to save you. You don't have anything to prove. But I do. I need your help. I'm sorry, Mickey. I could've messed up the mission. So did you find the antikythera device At the museum? No, and I turned that place inside out. Well, we have two of the elements, The Petoskey stone and the sapphire. Maybe we could trade them to try and get stumpwater free. No, no, Ivan wouldn't want us To run the risk of priggish getting ahold of the elements Just to save his ornery old hide. But let's go save that old geezer anyway. Save stinky pants. But we're gonna need some help. It's time to assemble the order. Have yourself a fine evening. You were fooled by two children? You are supposed to be the iron fist of our brotherhood. Don't fail me again. We won't, general. The alchemy machine is complete. Let's take Mr. Stumpwater over to the ironworks building As we prepare for the resurrection of the south. He can be our first test subject. But we don't have all the elements. Oh, don't worry. I've made my own arrangements. The elements will come to us. That is way cool. It's been around... Since the civil war. My signal flag, Handed down to me from members of the original order. When the other members see it, They'll know where to meet us. Grams, no one will know. Ha! Come on. We are not completely in the stone age, silly girl. Grams, are you sure they know where to come? Yeah, it's getting really late. I'm sure. It's just that... Well... There may not be many of us left. We were all a lot younger when we had our last meeting, And a lot of us have passed on. Buckshot. Haven't seen one of them flags in nearly 50 years. Mr. Plindenberg, I know that you've already met Mickey And my granddaughter, sully. Knew she was your kin right off. Found your way back to civilization? Don't give me any guff, girl. You're gonna need my help, Since I'm the only one Who showed up at your little party here. He's right, sully girl. And we got us some serious problems. Seems old priggish and his boys Have located a copy of the blueprints For the alchemy machine. Got 'er built down at the old iron factory. They've built the machine? Yep. And if I know priggish, He's gonna do away with Ivan if we don't deliver the elements. Okay, so, like, what plan do you guys have in place? For, like, when the copperheads show up Looking for the elements? Um... Seriously? Your sole purpose Was to protect the elements from the bad guys. You guys don't have an emergency plan? Well, look, the elements were hidden so well that... We never thought that this day would ever come. That's not true. One of us knew this day would come. Your granddaddy. And, uh, looks like he prepared you A little better than I first thought. You and your friend here Are the new order. You and jack brought us some new recruits. So what does that mean? That means that you two need to take a knee. This sword belonged to president Abraham Lincoln. As acting president of the secret order of the patriot, I, Anna e. Fowler-Bradford... your grandma was a fowler? Do initiate these brave young souls Into the secret order of the patriot. Repeat after me, But only if you truly believe in your hearts The words that I speak. I solemnly swear my allegiance To the united states of America... solemnly swear my allegiance To the united states of America... To protect its citizens and the constitution In the brightest of days And through the darkest of nights. To protect its citizens and the constitution In the brightest of days And through the darkest of nights. I shall defend our nation against all enemies, So help me god. And I shall defend our nation against all enemies, So help me god. Arise, brave knights, And prepare to defend your country. Thank you, grams. We've got some planning to do. You should be honored, Ivan. You're the first thing since ancient times To have your molecular structure rearranged Into pure silver. Damn, rotten copperheads. You almost smell nice. Take a bath? Sure did. Once a year whether I need it or not. Good timing for us. Ah. Buckshot, you sure they have him in there? Yeah. Priggish just took possession of this place. Another one of his foreclosures. Been doing some recon since the kids came by. Any idea how we're gonna get in there? Well... Might as well just knock on the front door. - What? - What? I kind of like that. You got some gumption, boy. Ha! First mission for the new order. Strap up. Here we go. It's no use, Mr. Stumpwater. We good old boys know how to tie a good old knot. Whoa. Bigger than I expected. Why, I do declare, That was a very impressive entrance. And you dented up your pretty little truck. We've come for Mr. Stumpwater. We have two of the elements, And we're willing to trade them for him. Mickey, don't do it. Get out of here. Stumpwater, shut up. Well, come on up here, boy. Let's see if we can make ourselves a deal. Let's go. I see you have acquired a new recruit. You're wrong, priggish. Buckshot has been a member of the order for a long time now. Ooh, dear, Then I'm afraid this is gonna be quite... Quite painful for you. Sorry, kid. Buckshot, what are you doing? Traitor. Don't you test me, little girl. For many years I've read the tales Of my great, great granddaddy's travels to the Sudan To retrieve the sapphire. At long last, It rests again in the proper family hands. Billy, place this in the wheel's first position. So... I'll be having that moment you promised me with stumpwater. Be my guest. HaHa. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Oh! Secure this in the wheel's second position. Sit tight. It's never gonna work without the final element, priggish. Oh, we have the third element, Mr. Matson. Oh, pardon me. I should say, you. You have the third element. See, the sapphire is exquisite and mysterious, And its mystical properties, They work like a power source. The heart of the machine And the Petoskey stone, Well, that's merely petrified coral from the great lakes With the proper density and weight To balance the reaction. But the third element... The third element is a conundrum. The antikythera device, It is, what we would call, The brains of the operation... Keeping time So that the elements move In perfect harmony. Our finest confederate craftsmen Were called in to create an exact replica to scale From the ancient blueprints we recovered. And would you believe That it fits perfectly in your... Pocket? Stupid yank child. That's it... Oh. Not very becoming of a lady, now, is it, Mrs. Fowler? Billy. Hello, boy. Ooh, I reckon I'm gonna enjoy watching you become silverfied. Your grammar's terrible. Back up. You didn't see the symbol, boy? Right there under your nose the whole time. Now, I couldn't just run y'all through the portal Without at least showing you the fate that awaits you. That'd be unfair. It's gonna be good. Billy, your Arkansas toothpick. It works. This machine will be the source of the wealth For the copperheads That will soon take over this country. I'm sorry, Ivan. Yeah, we just wanted to save you. We're not sunk yet, kids. Oh, yes, you are. You sunk, all right. Grams? Hold on, kids. What's the plan here? Y'all sit nice and still now. Just be patient. Your folks are gonna be so mad at me. Guys, seriously? You make sure to strike an interesting pose For my sculpture garden. Now! Thought it could use a shovel. Ah! Ah! What do we do, grams? Get the elements. You get the sapphire. I'll get the stone and the watch. You'll find I'm a lot more fun When my hands aren't tied, priggish. Bring it, old man. I've been waiting for a good tussle. Me too! Ding! The next time you pull a little razzle-Dazzle, You better tell me. Oh, what a nice kitty. Well, you had to believe I was a traitor. Well, I'll tell you this: You do it again, And you're gonna be looking for your dentures In the next county. Ooh. It's time for plan "b." Oh! That hurt. That hurt. Stumpwater, the old lady's bailing. I doubt it. Yeah. Breaker one-Nine. Breaker one-Nine. This is grams. It's been fun, but it's time for me to go. I'm just gonna leave you with a little something special. There you go. Got to go. Now you got troubles. Mama. Sully, behind you! I got you now. Okay, wait. Oh. What's with this girl and the shins? Grams, wait for me! Stupid little girl. Let's go, patriot! Bring it on, baldy. Take your best shot. My pleasure. Nice punch, Franken-Brain. Mickey, need a hand here! Sully, duck! No! Really? Oh! What in Dixie? Nice work, Mickey Matson! Hit it, grams! Oh, way to go, patriots! HaHa! Way to go, patriots. Way to go, buckshot! Stop, stop. What is it? We need to destroy the elements. Uh, what? If we don't, They'll just keep sending more copperheads. I know you guys have been protecting these things forever. That's what's gonna make this hard. But doing the right thing Usually isn't easy. So what's your plan? Buckshot, got any powder left for the lyle gun? Like this. A double charge ought to do it. ByeBye, beautiful. Love you, gramps. It's over, priggish. You lost. You're no southern gentleman. The south is filled with people who love this country And want it to grow stronger together. Now, what do you think you're doing? Love will always win over selfishness and greed. Oh, and, uh, one more thing. You stupid... You should duck. Yank child. No! No! You stupid, blue-Bellied boy. You have no idea what you've just done. A second explosion in town today? I think I just called for backup. And just in case those city cops are your friends, I called in the coast guard on my truck radio. A few of my grandpa jack's old friends. Yeah, and you ain't crowned upon kidnapping In these parts, priggish. And they gonna love to hear How you had me tied up in your basement. Go get him, boys! Commander Webster. Mickey! I think you've been looking for these two. Outstanding. I would expect nothing less from jack's grandson. Thanks. In your face, copperheads. Well, that'll teach you To mess with a seventh grader, huh? Come on. That'll harm ya! Come on. Get 'em out of here, boys. Way to go, Mickey. Bring it in, fur face. Not bad for a country boy. Hey, Mickey. Your grandpa left you one more thing. Aren't you guys coming? Nope. This one's all you, pal. Go down those stairs and take a right. "Dearest Mickey, "There are many forces out to destroy our great country. "I urge you to train yourself in every way possible "So you're ready at a moment's notice "When the secret order of the patriot is called upon. "I'm proud of the young man you have become, "And I love you with all my heart. "God bless. Grandpa jack." Shh. Hey, dad. Hey, Mickey. I didn't see you there. So how about we go to the tigers baseball game tomorrow? That would be fun, son, But I'm afraid we don't have the money. I'll buy the hotdogs. Ha! This is... This is a Morgan. Pretty cool, huh? Where did you get this? Grandpa jack left it for me. This is one of the rarest coins in U.S. History, One of the rarest silver dollars. Only 80 of them were ever discovered. This is worth over $100,000, Mickey. So it should help us keep the house. No. No, no. This is yours. - You should keep it. - Dad. It's okay. I want you to have it. Having parents that love me, That's the real treasure. Mickey... Mickey, you... You are the real treasure. Besides, Grandpa jack left me a whole box full of them. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my... Ha! I don't believe it! Well done, Mickey. Well done. # Somewhere along the line # The water got a little deep # And all my fear began to creep # # Around me # Oh, but somehow, just in time # # You helped to show me what was true # # And I would not have had a view # # Without you # And now we're here # At the finish line # And it is clear # We never fell behind # I'm never on my own # You're with me all the time # No matter where I go # You're standing by my side # # And there's no telling where... #
