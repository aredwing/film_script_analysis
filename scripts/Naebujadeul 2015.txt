I used to love this music... Have you seen "Chinatown"? Jack Nicholson acts as a private investigator working as a detective agency... A lady comes in and hires him to tail her husband but the husband gets killed and the wife was a fake. Then, the real wife shows up... Anyways, it's complicated, you know the conspiracy and twist... The truth that comes at the end is ugly and dirty... So, don't you want to know the truth? Hey, pay attention here. Was it for justice or revenge? I'll come to that later... Bad guys beat up Jack Nicholson, you know. We can talk about the movie later... I'm not here to watch a movie. Don't cut me off and listen to me. I'll get to the point now. So, anyways... God damn it, fuck. Jack Nicholson's nose was wacked but he goes to the wife and says It looks like half the city is trying to cover it all up which is fine with me. But Mrs. Mulwray, I goddam nearly lost my nose. And I like it. I like breathing through it. So why the hell are you doing this? You must have a reason for doing all this. For justice? Revenge? I don't care about any of that. But, Mr. Reporter... Damn it, I lost my hand. I like my hand. I like eating with it... wiping my ass with it... and jerking off with it... Yes. It seems a prosecutor's investigation is inevitable. Yes, we need to find a way to quiet down the public. Yes. I got this from Moon Il-seok, former accountant at Mirae Motors. It shows Mirae made a slush fund with 3 billion from Hangyul Bank and gave 30 million to Congressman Jang for his election campaign. Is it true that sex favors were offered at Oh's villa? Who were the women forced into it? You claimed Oh and Jang retaliated against you. Could you specify? How did you meet Oh and Jang? Through Lee Kang-hee, editor-in-chief of Nation Daily. And what's your relationship with Lee? That's a long story. So let me reveal it to the prosecutor. Can you tell us anything more? Ahn, president of a talent agency, revealed today at press conference that Mirae Motors set up a slush fund of $3 billion via an illegal loan from Hangyul Bank. Congressman Jang Pil-woo, the New Party's presidential candidate exerted pressure behind the scenes, according to Ahn. Sex favors were also allegedly offered at Mirae Motors Chairman Oh's villa. Mirae Motors and Congressman Jang's office have denied all allegations, and said they are more than willing to take legal action. My conscience is clear before the people of this country. I have never received money or favors from Mirae Motors. I can stake my political life on it. I will continue on my path, alone but proud as always never yielding to any political maneuvering or malicious target investigations. INSIDE MEN THE ORIGINAL 2 YEARS AGO Mr. Editor, it's almost deadline. Close the door. Director wants it done soon. Close the door. You're making me come in again. Which word are stuck with this time? With intentions or "doubts with intentions". Obviously it's "with intentions". There's no acting as a group. The context and the facts tell you that. I need to know more to say "with intentions". It's still rough at the moment. We stick with "with intentions". We... Our newspaper's view... Right? That's right. It's done. You're really... No chief editor discusses over a word. It's not a nice habit. I can't write something that goes against the company. Let's go and eat something. People should respect you for that, you know. Congressman Kim Seok-woo New Party The people were wise. Kim's predictable defeat. Lee Kang-hee Editor-in-chief, Nation Daily Call Lee at Nation Daily and invite him to dinner. Yes, sir. Is this an article or a piece of shit? Have you heard of the relations between Mirae Motors and Jang? We've kept it quiet as he's from our party. But I can feel that the bomb is about to explode. What do you mean by that? It's quiet with Hangyul's president hiding out overseas. But rumor says he's returning to Korea. Then the prosecution will at least pretend to take action. Today's phrase. "Station for transfer." It means it's time to change your ride. I'm just a journalist. What can I do? You picked Jang and him brought into politics. Backing him up with Mirae Motors. All part of your master plan, right? How about throwing me a line like this, is what I mean. Does that matter at this stage? Not so much... He's the setting sun. Chief Prosecutor Seoul District Office Senior Secretary Civil Affairs President's Office He can't rise again, can he? Chief Prosecutor Seoul District Office Senior Secretary Civil Affairs President's Office Nope... only a year left in his term. Right! What's important is who's next. The opposition party already threw in the towel... so it's either Kim Seok-woo or Jang Pil-woo. I was on bad terms with Jang at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office. If that bastard gets in, he'll never leave me in peace. He sure wouldn't. Isn't Kim your high school alumni? Elementary school, sir. Kim and I went to the same university. He could be the perfect match for us! Not bad at all, sir. Get something dirty on Jang. I'll take care of the rest. Yes, sir. Who's the sniper for this? A guy called Woo Jang-hoon at Special Investigations. Whose line is he from? No one's. He's from a regional college. But as a matter of fact... Is he a nut? No, he's a former cop. Cop? Yes. He had his days on the force with awards. But he had a temper and was a loner and didn't get along. A loner? He didn't get along with the police academy graduates. Then, he went on and took the bar exam and quit being a police. How did he end up at the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office? You remember the Busan Savings Bank corruption case 4 years ago? That was him? He received the president prize. After that, he started working there. What an interesting guy. Yes, he is. Yes. How do you do, sir? I'm Woo Jang-hoon. This is Mr. Oh Myung-hwan, from 17th year. Senior Secretary to President for Civil Affairs. Honor to meet you. - Sit, sit. - Yes, sir. Which year are you? 38th, sir. - You were a cop? - Yes, sir. Why become a prosecutor? Being a cop isn't bad. I wanted to be an excellent prosecutor just like you, sir. You're a role model to me, sir. He has guts, I like him. He sure has. Have a drink. Mr. Secretary! What's up at this hour? I'm having dinner at Okryu-dang. Really? Sure, no problem. Damn son of a bitch! How dare he order me to come! Who was it? I'll have to drop by the next room. Won't be long, eat first. I expect a lot from you. Thank you, sir. Take care, sir. My stomach still hurts. Why should I always drink for work? Have this, sir. It'll relieve the hangover. You're better than my wife. How's the Mirae Motors case? Driving smooth? Seok Myung-kwan went off the grid. It'll take more time than we thought. He's in the States? Right, put him on the wanted list, but it's a damn big country. This case is all about timing. You can't get him if timing's not right. Don't you trust me? Sure, I do. I should. Oh, regarding this year's personnel realignment... Yang was promoted to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office. Sorry about that. I pushed real hard for you... Just between you and me, is there anyone more loyal to the office than me? - Of course not. - Then this Yang... son of a bitch got better results as a prosecutor? You're the ace when it comes to results. But that bastard's father-in-law pulled strings at The Blue House. He's close to the CID director... So you're saying... a loser like me with no connections should just accept this shitty situation? What can we do? This country is all about connections. That's why without fail, you need to get Jang. Then fuck connections and lines. You'll be on the fast track. Even a fly has its spleen? Bullshit. I'm a shooter. I'm a scorpion. That's why you killed the woman you loved? To become Daehan Group's son-in-law? Is that a threat? No, I will kill you! I won't forgive you for ruining my sister! Cut! How was it? You really have to ask? - You really want to act? - Yes. Everyone knows you have a strong will for acting. Okay. Send him in a minute. The Director's here. Loosen up. Please, loosen up. Damn. Good evening, sir. He's still hesitating. Keeps drinking... Using up our expense money. Damn bastard only picks expensive places. Sons of bitches. I'm fine being a Joan of Arc for the sake of justice. But when I think about my family, I'm not quite sure... But when I think about my family, I'm not quite sure... Moon Il-seok Accounting Manager at Mirae Motors This is driving me damn crazy. Moon Il-seok Accounting Manager at Mirae Motors This is driving me damn crazy. Shit, this squid is tough. Who the fuck are you, blockhead? I'm a Republic of Korea prosecutor, asshole. Sit up straight, fucker. How much did you pocket? Hundred thousand? A million? What are you talking about? Do you think this is a goddamn joke? You want to rot behind bars the rest of your life? Listen to me carefully. Mirae Motors got 3 billion from Hangyul Bank to set up a slush fund. And 30 million got parked into Jang's campaign fund. You pocketed, let's say, one million while managing the slush fund. Then got caught and fired. You came to me to get back at them, right? If so, you should start talking about the deal that we're gonna make instead of drinking, stupid. You wanna go to the prosecutor's or you wanna hand me the file and go home? First, the men's room... I need to pee. Sure, take your time. Maybe you were a bit too harsh on him. You can never be harsh enough... You don't get it... Oh, I see. Why didn't you stop me? Bring him back here. I'll go easy on him. Bring in the girls as well then... We have the expenses, let's have some fun today. Prosecutors in Korea are all just puppets. We are all pawns. Let them come. - Sir... - Let everyone come. Sir... I'm sorry. - Mr. Bang. - Yes, sir. Pull yourself together. If you don't want to treat others like a puppet and wipe their asses you should get a grip. Yes, sir. But how did you know he messed with the slush fund? Even though they clean up nice the dirty ones will always stink. But that asshole talks about justice? Fuck him, asshole. Damn it, I'm screwed. That little prick, how dare he throw squid... Good god, let's talk after you've seen the script. Oh, Mr. Ahn. I'm always on the actor's side. My guests have arrived. I'll talk to you soon. Okay, sure. Director Park's nagging me. Which Director Park? You know, the one that received the Director's Award... It's a pleasure to meet you. This is Director Kang Minho. - I'm Ahn Sang-goo - I'm Kang Min-ho. Nice to meet you. What did director Kang want? Well you know, he wants to meet our star, Ms. Kim. She can't meet him with script you know. We need toilet paper to wipe our asses. Of course, you need the script first. You've seen our script, right? Even a fly has its spleen? Bullshit. I'm a shooter. I'm a scorpion. That's why you killed the woman you loved? To become Daehan Group's son-in-law? Is that a threat? No, I will kill you! I won't forgive you for ruining my sister! Yes, we've seen the script. Please, let me introduce my actor here. Nice to meet you. It's Seo Hye-jin. Well, I can see you have talent... So, when's our star coming? Oh, Ms. Kim will be here shortly. She's stuck in traffic. - Mr. Kang. - Yes. How about Hye-jin here? Leave us alone now. See you next time. She studied acting in Russia so, her acting style is a bit different. But that could be her take, right? She also has a good heart unlike other actors. Her parents are teachers. Well, I'm not putting any pressure on you. I'm not saying I'll accept Ms. Kim if you cast Hye-jin. How could I think like that? But, what if that's what I mean? Oh my, you really... have a unique sense of humor, right? You find that funny? Did I say something funny? Just because I talk with a smile on my face... you think I'm a joke? You'll take me seriously if I make you see your own guts? Come on, I didn't mean to... Don't get me wrong... I really didn't mean... Chill, I'm just messing with you. What I meant was... that I'm asking you politely. For you to consider my proposal for your movie. Hye-jin depicts a femme fatale like Lauren Bacall. You know Lauren Bacall, don't you? You know, Humphrey Bogart's wife. Oh my, she was awesome in "The Big Sleep". You know a lot of movies. - You seem like an expert. - No, I'm not. - You studied movies? - Nothing like that. The thing is... Excuse me. How did it go? I'm in a meeting right now. Get the tools ready. He's gone, what shall we do? We sowed and they reaped... fuckers. Good evening, boss! You got the stuff? I'm sorry. We did our best, but... I'm sorry. Don't go home empty handed on your wife's birthday. I put some cash in the box so get her some flowers with it. Thank you, boss! If you're thankful, do better. I could die for you. Damn. I don't need your life. Just get your job done cleanly. Yes, boss. You left me in spring rain, and came back in spring rain. We parted with smiles on that day. But today we are in sorrow at this minute, at this hour. We are looking out the window all in tears. You came back to me as spring rain... Goddamn nail... Nation Daily You should quit smoking at your age. You ought to get married at your age. What's the use? So I can live alone, like you? Tell your wife and kids to move back to Korea. Don't live like an old widower when you're not one. Live alone, life is all about solitude. By the way, you shouldn't just drop in here. You know there are eyes watching you. Let a hundred eyes watch me... I ain't scared. Why are you so excited? Well, what shall I call it? Expandability? Or compatibility? What is it? Useful materials for you in politics, finance or academia... and for my expansion in entertainment or gambling... Or shall I just go into politics? So what is it? They got 3 billion from Hangyul Bank and 3 million of that went to Congressman Jang. What? The file on the slush fund of Mirae Motors' chairman. You keep it for me. This is a copy I've made. We'll see what good it might bring us. Don't release it without my consent, got it? What a foxy bear. You left me in spring rain, and came back in spring rain. We parted with smiles on that day. But today we are in sorrow, at this minute, at this hour. We are looking out the window all in tears. You came back to me as spring rain... you're raining on my heart, too. Stop staring at them. I only brought first class gals, so don't worry. Hurry inside. You'll get soaked. Moon tried to leak it, but he gave in even before I touched him. I got something to say. I've been in business long enough and am pretty busy with other stuff... I can't take care of Mr. Jo's shit forever. Why don't you do it yourself? I'm not a pimp or anything. See you. Fuck. Mirae Motors' temporary employees' union has long been considered a danger to the state economy. Rife with North Korean sympathizers, it has begun to do serious damage to the nation's industry and economy. These comma bastards... Mirae Motors Chairman Oh Hyun-soo This is why you need to provide them just enough to live on. So, they don't do something stupid. Don't mind them, time will solve everything. What are you talking about? The public are dogs and hogs. Why worry about them? Let them bark for a while, then it'll die away. Is it so? Anyway, it's a desirable match. The media and a corporation, in a marketing partnership. I'll look forward to your excellent writing. Sure. I'm terribly sorry for being late, sir. No, you're on time. It wasn't too bothersome for you to come out here? Play is never bothersome. How's the temporary employees' protection bill? Don't worry, I'm blocking its passage with my life. It will end up in tatters. - Rags and tatters. - That's right! - Why don't we celebrate then? - I'm all up for it! Let's go! Let's go, buddy. Alright, way to go. All set. Alright, now for the ninth hole! Look at his club! It's so solid and strong. It's a driver! It's a presidential club, sir. Let me swing it! - Damn it. - It didn't reach the pin! Let me substitute in. My club is quite solid, too. Way to go, buddy! Let me see what you got. Albatross! It's an albatross! We should celebrate it! Sure we should! To Lee's albatross! Mr. Ahn Sang-goo. Do you think you're in the same league as us? You should know your size. Why do you steal garbage when asked to clean it? They got 3 billion from Hangyul Bank and 3 million of that went to Congressman Jang. What? The file on the slush fund of Mirae Motors' chairman. You bugged me? You have another copy? Bring it out. Cut it here... Here? I said here, you blockhead! You'll have to live as an idiot from now on. Jo! Cut it off and send him to a psychiatric hospital. You damn motherfucker! Hey, hey! Jo! Stop it! Please stop it! Please stop! Please! Stop it! How long were you admitted? I was confined a year and a half. They administer medicine twice a day. If you take them you don't feel hungry even if you don't eat. And it makes you sleep all day long. I thought it was making me an idiot so I didn't take it anymore. Goddam fuckers. How did you escape? The hospital closed due to financial difficulties. So, I walked out the front door. Are you doing this for revenge? If this is insinuated as something sweet like revenge... it seems a bit too emotional. What I want is justice. 3 MONTHS AGO Hey! Did you wash up the men's room? Make my golf clubs shine! And don't forget to clean up the office! Hey! Did you wash up the men's room? Hey! Did you wash up the men's room? Seoul Jungbu Police Station Make my golf clubs shine! And don't forget to clean up the office! Send Just e-mailed Ahn's files, sir. Wow, how about some hot guys? I'm available, too. I need to pee. Hey. I'm in hurry but the ladies' room is full. I'll give you a nice tip. Thank you! You still look hot. Well, sure I am. Do you really have to do that? If they want me to be an idiot, I have to be one. No other options. Scary. They took your hand and now they eavesdrop? If I'd known, I wouldn't have ended up like this. Why did you want to see me? Let's make a movie. What's the genre? Vengeance drama. Hard boiled. The target? Jang Pil-woo. 100,000 in advance. 200,000 balance. 200,000 in advance, 100,000 balance. Shit... alright then. Give your profile to Jung first. Then ask him to book you at this party. Am I the only lead? You think one top would be enough? Who's my co-lead then? Guy named Park... You've never met him. Don't we have to meet? He thinks he's the only lead. He doesn't know about me? Who can you trust, anyway? And you trust me? You're not the same girl that you once were. Take off your sunglasses. Let's look each other in the eye. You're dead if you betray me. How much information is out there? According to the Public Prosecutor's Office six people participated in the mess. Five graduates and one professor. Public is criticizing on issuing an arrest warrant. Why did they have to draw a mouse? Damn it. We have our own cover story, yes? Well, the perspective is somewhat different with the prosecution office. Kill ours! Print the article based on the prosecutor's data. This time, we need to play nice with them. You agree with me, don't you? Absolutely. Company policy is clear. I'm planning on writing about the history of creative and artistic graffiti and graffiti that concerns distortion and deception. That seems okay. Be on that topic for three papers. Next. Rumor is that Bank President Mr. Seok who fled under embezzlement charges is coming back. I heard if he returns someone will get hurt pretty bad. Hey. Get to the point. While Mr. Seok was the bank president at Hangyeol Bank he illegally loaned money to Mirae Motors. Also, Congressman Jang put some pressure on the matter. How did he take? Mirae Motors received 300 billion from the bank and passed on 30 billion to Mr. Jang. Are you sure? It came from Congressman Kim's party. The election is coming up but his approval rate is decreasing so he's after anything he can. I think there's something to it. I heard reliable info is posted on social network. Those keyboard warrior will post anything on line without all the facts. Social network is their playground. What will become of this country... Newspaper is the public air. Focus on the facts. Don't go crazy like those mad dogs who are worthless. The spear is pointing toward the inner circle. Even Prosecutor's office seems to take Mr. Kim's side. You want to switch rides? We've came till the end of the line so why not? During that time we ran the red light, oversped and the driver has no license. What's the problem? If Seok Myung-kwan comes back here Congressman Jang won't have a choice. Hey, Reporter Kim. Who do you think put you in that chair? You think I'm working for Jang Pil-woo like an idiot? You won't be sitting there with Mirae Motors. Nation Daily won't exist without Mirae Motors commercials. Am I wrong? If Jang Pil-woo is arrested Mirae Motors is gone as well. Chairman Oh can always drive away on a different engine. But who would drive a car that's been wasted. We're not trying to protect Jang's life we're saving Mirae Motors for our sake. Is your little brain getting all this? I'm sorry. I should have thought deeper. Come on, you're making me uncomfortable. This is for us both so no hard feelings, okay? Good luck. No problem. Good luck to us both. No problem at all. By the way, Seok will come back soon enough. Oh my, what to do then? What other way is there? The guilty one should be punished by the law. That's a just society, isn't it? My finish is poor. The ball won't go far. I see. Maybe it's the golf club. Would you like to try my Honma golf club set in my car? I own a Honma gold club as well. It's a five star... Five star? So, how's working for Nation Monthly? I was better off at Nation Daily. Nation Monthly is just Nation Daily's pawn. Then, why receive bribe money for writing an article? No reporter writes for nothing these days. I'm sorry, sir. You still have access to the Public Prosecution's Office? Of course. I make a living by sucking up to them. Anything I can do for you? I heard they are targeting Jang? Yes, they don't have any proof. They're just fishing. Who's fishing? Woo Jang-hoon, he belongs to the Special Investigations. He's kind of an asshole. Who's in charge there? Chief prosecutor Choi Chung-sik. He's on the District Chief Prosecutor's side. So he's on the President for Civil Affairs line. Yes, he's on Kim Seok-woo's side. Where's Mr. Woo's hometown? He's from Gyeongsang-do. Is he a purebred? No, he's a mutt. He's quite competent but he has no connections. What's he like? He's fucked up. He doesn't get along with the Reporters. He's an arrogant asshole. Oh, great... It's a five star. - Hey, Ko. - Yes, sir. You should rejoin Nation Daily shouldn't you? I'll do anything if you take me back. So, that means I can ask you a favor? Yes, of course. I'll do anything for you. Have a drink with Woo Jang-hoon. Pardon? Great! Park Jong-pal Moon Sash These are all clean. You're contributing to a big cause. Song Man-seop Jang Pil-woo's Campaign Club/ I'm just doing what I enjoy. Song is Jang's Campaign Club president and also the Representative of River Construction. Their main business is redeveloping new towns. Jang's second brother-in-law is a board member. Who is this guy? He's a representative at Moon Sash which produces sash. They are meeting quite frequently. Look into this Moon Sash company for now. I'm sure it has connections with Jang Pil-woo. Okay. But... they're quite powerful people. Can we really catch them? We might take the fall if we mess with them. Our request for the expense is being delayed. How on earth can we investigate? Damn it! Mr. Bang. Yes? You think I'm a loser, don't you? I mean, I have no connections but shows up trying to do something at my age... You like dogs? Yes, I do. Not when it's cooked. Why don't we quit this bull shit and raise dogs in the countryside? You don't get it, do you? What I'm saying is go out there and try bringing back something useful. If you don't wanna end up cleaning dog shit! Okay... Why are you still here? Yes, anything useful... Did you have lunch? Not yet, boss. Come join me. No thanks, help yourself. You don't want to eat something cooked by a cripple? Not at all, sir! It's just... It doesn't seem enough for you. Food is meant to be shared. Come on. Yes, boss. Take this. Thank you. Have some kimchi, too. How are things going? Gave them five big ones today. Try to meet up with Jang directly. Guess they must be done poking around. They promised a meeting with Jang soon. This is clean. Impossible to track down. Moon Sash wouldn't approach Jang for a small bit of profit. And why would Jang be connected to that small company for a few pennies? What are their connections? This is Ahn Sang-goo, started from a small gang, and made it big enough to be called 'president'. He's a mobster? Yes. Also I did some background checks. In 1996, he was jailed for bribing TV producers. Does he have ties with the entertainment business? This is big. Everything from construction, loans, talent agency, night clubs, to hostess bars. He's also suspected of interfering in elections. So, his jail time for bribery was to cover that up? Sure. Also, the Moon Sash guy was Ahn's henchman. About No. 3 in the gang. Then how'd he become a cripple? For that, he must have upset someone... quite a bit. Who? Political thug who once rode high reaches out to Jang through his henchman. Don't you smell something? Sure do. If it's normal business, he can just bribe discreetly. His methods seem different. Why does everything have to be so secret? You scumbags. They're setting a trap for Jang! In Korea the prosecutor, in order to serve justice, should be solitary. Absolutely right. Extremely lonely. I was one of them. When was it...? In 1990, when the president declared the war against crime, I brought in tons of them! Gangsters who run casinos, and the sons of bitches paid off by those fuckers... It turned out the head of our office was one of those sons of bitches. So what did you do? Fuck the title. I was a lone, righteous man. I dragged him in, too! Of course, you did! Don't mix the drinks! Why did you call me? It's been a while since we met and had a drink. You said you had vital information, so why are you only drinking? If you just want to drink, you should say, "Let's drink." Then you'd have gladly offered to buy me a drink? What's gotten into you? It's not like we never drink. Just drink up. But can you be a Supreme Prosecutor with no connections? You should pass through there to end your career in Seoul. Or you end up in a remote province. So? Why are you explaining shit that everybody knows? I worry about you, that's all. You have no connections... So you're explaining to me that I'm a fucker with no connections? You're not a fucker, you just have no connections. What the fuck are you doing now? Take it easy, man... Don't be so sensitive. It's pathetic. Goddamn it. Alright, here he comes. It's been a while, sir. This is Prosecutor Woo from Seoul Prosecutors' Office. This is Mr. Jo, the owner of Joyang Mirae Development. Nice to meet you, I'm Jo Yang-sik. Sure, nice to meet you. Have a seat. Please give me a minute, sir. I know, I know, I know! Look at me, it's not what you think. It's just a friendly drink together. No harm in knowing a man like him. You can get an allowance, then later... Maybe he can get you connected? You motherfucker! Hey Go Sang-chul, you got fired from Nation Daily for bribery. Want to get fired from your life for messing with a prosecutor? I paid for what I drank, don't claim otherwise later. Damn fucker. Take care! He really is a son of a bitch. Talk to me. They went into a building. Place seems a bit suspicious. How long have they been there? About two hours? And we have a new face tonight. A new face? So, what did you do then? They wanted me to quit, so what could I do? I left without regret! And opened a private practice, laying low... until that man there got me into Congress. Welcome, my friend! Our Congressman seems a bit soaked. I haven't had that much. Let me introduce you. This is Park Jong-pal, president of Moon Sash. Same name as the old boxer who had a strong hook. Honor to meet you, sir. I'm Park Jong-pal. Did you take in a lot? A few bomb shots... I don't mean alcohol. I don't know. Song takes care of it. Better be careful, you could get in trouble. Then what should I do? A campaign sucks up money. Oh closed his wallet because of Seok, that son of a bitch. How else do I get elected? Let's bring him in. And then? If there's something to settle, let's settle it before it's too late. Seok Myung-kwan Former President of Hangyul Bank I'm deeply sorry for causing so much anxiety to the nation. Seok Myung-kwan Former Pres/dent of Hangyul Bank Any comments on the charges against you? Former president of Hangyul Bank was charged with embezzlement, malpractice, and flight of capital abroad based on the Additional Law on Specific Crimes. He reported to the Prosecutors' Office at 9:30 am. Wake up. Call me in ten minutes, sharp. Mirae must've offered you a position in the group. President of an affiliate company? Nope, a big chunk of land under the name of your son. I got it right! Look. They offered a presidential pardon in a year, right? But what if... Jang doesn't win the primary? Oops, what'll you do then? Did you think about that? Listen to me, Mr. Seok. I'm not pushing you into a corner. Shit, who's calling? Excuse me. How did it go? You wanted me to call you. Oh, yeah? Prepare the documents and request a warrant right away. Whose warrant? If Jang loses the primary, naturally there'll be no pardon. Then you're fine with spending 10 years in prison? You know Moon from Mirae Motors? He was their accounting manager? He was about to hand me the slush fund files 2 years ago. But Jang and Oh had a hunting dog to intercept it before I got it. So I sowed, and they reaped. Motherfuckers... But you know what? Moon had another copy of the files. That's what that phone call was about. Most importantly... someone's going to give me that copy. Why? He wants me to get Jang and Oh, those sons of bitches. You must have something to say now. Okay then... You can take the fall and spend the ten years... in prison. Bravo, bravo. Look, Mr. Seok Myung-kwan. If you cooperate I'll reduce your sentence into five years. He almost cracked. Hope this may help your wise decision, sir. It's been delivered? Yes, I think he fully understood. He's such a softie, must've been shocked. But what can we do? Someone must be held responsible. Deadline is coming up. When will you finish writing? You seem concerned. Obvious concerns my age men have. Concerns for children and stock trading plus, lovers. Something is really bothering you. Since your kids are all married and you don't have any stocks and also no lover. What are you working on? I haven't finished writing it yet. I'm getting hungry after writing a bit. Let's get something to eat. Oh my, an article isn't like a weather forecast... No way... Former president of Hankyul Bank Seok commits suicide! Prosecution's forced interrogation caused the tragedy Around 9:30 am on the 17th while being questioned on embezzlement, slush fund charges... Did you force him or threaten him during interrogation? Answer the question. Prosecutor Wu. You've brought shame to the whole office. You know what that means? Damn it. You're really an arrogant bastard. Shouldn't you at least feel sorry about this? Supreme Prosecutor's Office is a joke to you? You wanna be targeted and be stripped? Yes, I get it. Calm down. Seok commits suicide due to forced interrogation from the Prosecutor's Office! - Lee Kang-hee Nation Daily Editor in Chief It sucks, right? Have you eaten? Take a few days off. Have something to eat. So you want to call it quits? What else can we do? Open the coffin and cross-examine the dead? I begged to the Inspection Dept. to save you from suspension. So take some days off. And then? You want to send me to some provincial office? How convenient to blame the guy with no connections! Are you rebelling against me? Have I ever done that? So just do what I tell you. Why? Did Jang offer you a position? The Prosecutor General? Korean prosecutors, we do as we're told. It's time to let him go. Thank you for calling me, sir. You came a long way. Introduce yourselves. I'm Lee Gang-hee from Nation Daily. Big fan of your column. I'm Oh Myung-hwan. It's been a while, Mr. Secretary. So you're done prying into me? How are you, sir? No, it's a misunderstanding! How could I dare do that? It turns out that some nobody with no connections caused all this trouble, to make a name for himself. We're sending him to the provinces, so he'll never bother you again. I'll count on you. Thank you, sir. Anytime. Sir, you're still in action. You're always on the job. That's what politics is. You never grow old. That's right. All those hotshots in politics grow so old the moment they retire. It's quite interesting. Desire for power, honor and sex... Those desires are what keeps you young. - Is that so? - Yes! Lichtenberg said something like this. Less the desire the happier you become... Which is total bullshit. I totally agree. Investigations done by those who haven't had real power is bullshit. Yes, that's why we live young. You're right. Let's get started! Sure, let's drink! Prepare your driver. We'll have to check the newcomer's club first. Great! Well said! Let's do that. - Here, here. - Let's go! So the party is set? This Saturday. Park, it's time to wind up the clock. Excellent. I'll make sure to deliver it to him. Thank you. Girls, take your seats. His club is said to be the hardest among the presidential staff. Is it? We'll definitely have to see that. My friend should be turned on very quickly tonight. It's your jackpot day, buddy. Why don't you get some sleep? That's what I do at home. Hello. Sir, this is Go. I dug into Moon Sash as you asked. What did you get? The company is only 3 months old. It's run by a former gangster. A gangster? He was the No. 3 in Ahn Sang-goo's gang. Ahn Sang-goo's gang? Park was Ahn's henchman? This is Lee Kang-hee at Nation Daily, the head of politics department. I am Ahn Sang-goo. There's a new gang organization in town. He's the boss. He looks young. He's a very smart kid. If a gang is also smart he may become trouble, no? I'm not that smart. I look forward some great help from him on the presidential election. It's a new beginning for me so I will do my best. Take it. Loosen up and keep your head down. Follow the ball. I'm just warming up. Address the ball... This tiny ball is playing hard to get. You need to loosen up and look at the ball. I think I see the ball. Loosen your grip and watch the ball. Only then, you will get what you want. Take the GED exam and go to any college. I'm far from studying. Why did you become a gangster? Well... That's the road went after I came to Seoul. You will live like a punk? You came to me to succeed, right? You think you can do whatever I tell you? I'll follow you nicely if you lead me well. Bring in the girls after 10 minutes. Yes, sir. Sang-goo. Prosecutor's Office is no joke. They're after illegal election activities. They'll know what we did for them. I'm sure they won't arrest us. The opposite party is the problem. If I go to jail... this party has a lot to lose as well... Why don't you take the fall for offering bribery. Trust Jang Pil-woo. He won't overlook you. I don't give a shit about Jang. I only work for you. My connections are also your connections. How was the party? Lee found out... What? I'm tired, Gang-hee. Maybe I'm too old for this. It's not like we're saving this country. You couldn't close the deal? It's been a while, sir. How are you? Did you find out? I'm waiting for an answer. What game are you playing? We should meet. Who was it? Someone I know. Damn, it's cold. You're still alive. Didn't want to die alone. Park from Moon Sash, he's working for you, right? That dumb-ass... Is it obvious? Stupid fella... He could end up miserable if he keeps up that scheme. Do you still have what I gave you? That almost cost me my life. It didn't cost your hand though. Do you think I betrayed you? Well, are your family still in the States? I paid all their tuition, I paid for your fancy mansion in Bundang. Are you blackmailing me? Don't get me wrong. We had a good time together once. What do you want? I'll give you a huge plot of land in Gyeonggi if you help me. Listen to me, Sang-goo. Those guys are monsters. The more you bite them, the bigger and stronger they become. Don't you get it what it's like to fight against them? Shit, I don't know. I will fight till the end. You just stay out of this. Do you have the copy? I don't want blood to get on your hands... so decide wisely. Hey, bro. I'll be back. What the fuck? Lee spilt champagne on it. Goddamn... shit! Yes, sir. How did it go? I confirmed his schedule. He'll go to Royal Hotel sauna after the climbing 's done. You gotta steal that, by all means! No problem, boss. What did Lee tell you? Think he'll tell Jang? Not so easily... He has a small guilty part in it. Shit! How should I catch this punk... He seems to know something. I can't just get rid of him. My gosh, that bastard. That's editor Lee Gang-hee and he's a high school alumni with Jang. Lee Gang-hee at Nation Daily? You know him? How can I forget? He made a fool out of me. Wait a minute. Mirae Motors is the biggest advertiser for Nation Daily, right? That's right. The rich and the press for a candidate funding for president... Damn justice. The press was all over Jang when he was fired from the Prosecutor's Office. Nation Daily made Jang a star and Lee was in charge of the political department. So, the man who made Jang and arranged Mirae as a sponsor was Lee Kang-hee? It makes sense. It's over when a star, money and the press are involved. By the way sir... what should I tell the chief prosecutor? Tell him that I'm fishing in a remote village, very relaxed! I know what you mean... but I'm just an employee... Let me out of this. Really? Suit yourself. Thank you. By the way, back when Korea Steel was being investigated didn't you have dinner with its General Affairs manager? How was the dinner? The dinner? It was good. No sir, it's not like that! He's a hometown friend. We only had dinner. I understand, it's hard to say no to a friend. So what's Ahn up to? Not much yet. But it really was only dinner! Got it, got it. I just mean that we need to stick together. Where have you been, my dearest Sang-goo? What? You want money? You should go out and work if you need money, loser. Extorting customers with that ugly hook? You know Moon Il-seok? I was supposed to receive... Are you okay? You're not hurt? You must've drunk too much. What the hell are you? Fucker! Sir! Are you okay? You should've gone after him! Damn it! It's because... Are you okay? Did you get anything? Whew, it stinks here. Please, clean up. What did you dig up? Woo Jang-hoon at the Seoul Prosecutor's Office. He was going to receive the bribery info from Moon 2 years ago. Damn, it won't be easy. Shit! - My god! - Did you screw up? Come on, I'm not new at this thing. Then how he find out? I don't know how. Will you be okay with a prosecutor involved? Nothing goes as planned. It's all fucked up. That punk got me, son of a bitch. How long has it been? It's been an hour since he went in the hotel sauna. He left Moon Sash and came straight here. Any contact with Ahn Sang-goo? Not yet... Shit. What's he doing here? You say Ahn disappeared? Sorry, sir. Move your ass now and get that son of a bitch! Stupid jerk. Damn useless bastard. Hey, Mr. Park! Champion! Oh, my! Are you a member here? Yes, you are too? Of course. I'm a regular. They give good haircuts here. Yes, I can see. Excuse me for a sec. Hello. You sure? Ahn owns a hotel in Gwangju. Park used to run it for him. Is that so? Stay calm and do as I say from now on. Got it. I'll take care of it. Yes, okay. You busy? Let's have a beer. - I'm a bit tied up... - Just a sip. Yes, sir. Tell me. He hasn't spilled yet. You damn losers. Bring it here! First cut here. And here. And for here, I guess we should cut right above the ankle. Wait! What? Anything to tell us? Where is Ahn hiding? How did it go? I got the watch, boss. Be careful. Lots of eyes watching. Bring it quick. You bastards will be skeletons by the time I die. Seems like Park got busted. Fucking morons. Fuck, this is hot! Boss. Boss, it's me! Damn it. Get him! Fuck! Lift him up. You cripple. You fucking prick. Yes, got him. Dickhead. Ahn got away. How could you let him go? Shut the fuck up! Should've killed that fucker when I had the chance. You caused this shit, so you should clean it up. If things go wrong because of Ahn, I won't go down alone. You know that. Of course I know. That's why all along I've been cleaning your shit and wiping your ass, too. So... keep cleaning my shit and wiping my ass. Then you can be a cabinet member or prime minister. Everyone has a pre-destined role in life. You're destined to clean my shit all your life. Prime minister, Lee. Okay? Fucking constipation! You're awake? Hey, mobster! Even if you lost a hand, what kind of gangster is so bad at fighting? You'd be dead if not for me. Watch your mouth, you filthy little dog. What do you expect? A prosecutor to speak respectfully to a fucking gangster? Listen carefully as I won't repeat this. Okay? You remember Moon Il-seok? Ex-accounting manager of Mirae Motors. He was going to give me the slush fund file 2 years back. The records from Mirae Motors. But a fucking rat intercepted it. Who could that be? You are asking me? That's what you lost your hand for, isn't it? Playing games with those files. Are you nuts? I must've hit you too hard the other night. Fuck. Okay then how about this? What is it that you want? Revenge, isn't it? You know what I want? I want justice. Because I'm a fucking prosecutor of Korea. I'd like to help with your revenge, you wanna work with me? Good deal, isn't it? You're quite funny, Mr. Prosecutor. You think you're John Wayne? Justice? Does a sweet thing like that still exist in this country? If you wanna play with that shit, help yourself. I'm not interested. You thugs don't listen when we talk nicely. You listen carefully. If you don't cooperate, you'll be charged for confinement and assault on Moon. What'll it be? I just got in. See the light on the ceiling? - The light. - Pardon? Okay! Got it! You did? Great job! Bravo! Tell him to get a bottle of soju! Buy a bottle of soju on your way back. Any brand is fine. Tell him to buy 'Dew!' Fresh. Mr. Bang. Mr. Dipshit Gangster would prefer Dew. Fresh! Damn it. That toilet is fucked up. What the fuck. Damn it you! Cut the crap! You think it'll do? Oh's not in it. Plenty of ways out for Jang. This can only nail the president of his campaign club. Where's the file? - I told you they took it! - Fuck you! You think I'll buy that shit? You weren't listening when I told you that? You're saying you trusted Lee that much? Giving him the original without making a copy? You know there is something... between him and me. Fuck! We have a special bond between us. Like brotherhood. Special bond between a journalist and a gangster. Got it! Then how much did you give? - Huh? - Didn't you? The fucking special bond of yours is giving him something to get something back. Why'd you give the slush fund file to Lee Gang-hee?! We need insurance to survive in this world. Ah, you got insurance, but no copy? You think I'll buy that, you son of a bitch! I told you already that they took everything! He is a fucking loser. A blockhead. Prosecutor. Fuck you! I think we should move to another place. Why? It's a bit weird for guys to stay in a... Why is it weird? Fuck! And Jang's gang must be searching for him everywhere. Staying in Seoul is too dangerous. Hey, do you have any place to hide in the countryside? I have some bros in Gwangju. But damn Park knows them all. Great! Who is it? What brings you here? Bastard... You're the only one catching bad guys in Korea? Couldn't you have at least eaten regularly? Bastard... How's the food? Sorry we don't have much. It tastes good. - Are you okay? - Okay with what? Are things cleaner at the prosecution, compared to the police? I'm full. I'll get going. - Leaving already? - Got some early morning business. Don't come out. Night. Damn... bastard. - Careful with driving! - Yes. This was his room. Make yourself at home. I'm sorry to cause you trouble. I'll pay back your kindness later. It's nothing. Never mind. Just take care of my son. He's still immature and out of touch. He's not immature. A bit rude, but I'll take care of that myself. - You don't have to worry. - Sure. - Good night. - Night, sir. If you're walking in hell, you should march on! Fuck you. This isn't enough. We definitely need the slush fund file. You're saying there's no copy? He says so but... Professor, how are you doing? What? I'm a bit concerned... a gentleman like you engaged in politics... When I first joined the congress someone said to me... the only goal for a congressman... is to be part of the ruling party. Politics is survival in a broad term. Survival of the country and the people. And my survival. It must be tough. It's not easy especially in the opposition party. - I need something big. - Professor. Shall I... make you an interesting proposal? What is it? Please prepare a press conference for Ahn Sang-goo. You want me to back that? I'm sure it'll be a good opportunity for you as well. How about the file? I'll take care of it. Will Ahn himself show up? If he doesn't... We'll have to make him show. Made a deal? He gets Jang then join the Supreme Prosecutor's Office. So that's why he wanted to get Jang so bad. Can you trust him? You want me to walk away? I wonder if he'll stab you in the back. Prosecutors in Korea are like that. They suck up to those with power. He needs to get Jang for his own sake. Still, don't trust him completely. You can't be too careful. He might stab you in the back. You got a great car! Is it a new one? The balance? You're the only one raking it in, when the film's not even released. It's not the actor's fault but the director's. Take to the hills for a while. Sang-goo, how about going away with me? Who gives a damn about revenge? We can drink Mojitos in the Maldives. Like old times. You should bury memories in your heart and keep no feelings for buses that have left. What's with you? Take care, Mr. Chairman. Bye-bye. You must've studied hard to become a prosecutor. I had blood in my stool. My ass couldn't take sitting at a desk 24/7. Most people are on their way up once they become prosecutors... getting married into rich families. So will you be my matchmaker? What is your reason to get Jang? The real one. When I was a policeman, I caught a lot of bad guys. I mean a lot! - Especially thugs like you. - You rude bastard! But no point in arresting them... Fuck. I didn't graduate from the police academy. So I got stuck with all the shitty work. You know... one sows and another reaps. That's why you became a prosecutor? But now, the issue is lines of influence. What's the use of an outstanding record? Hicks like me with no connections can't get anywhere. What a great country! Now you've started, you need some stars on your chest. Did anyone ever become Chief Prosecutor without connections? Article 11, chapter 2 of the Constitution: all men are created equal. And shall not be discriminated by gender, religion or social status, in any areas including political, economic, social and cultural life. Damn fly! Fuck it, you gangster! Don't you think our kids should live in a country like that? You're so fucking righteous. You've got a copy of it, don't you? You might call each other bro but you don't share the same blood. You would've made a copy before giving it to Lee. Jang's popularity has soared by 10 percent. He could win the primary, then go on to be president. Can you watch that happen? I can't. A president like him. I've had enough already, now give me the copy. Didn't you want to use me to catch Jang? Then use me! If you don't take this chance now, you'll hide all your life like a fucking loser. All your life. Forever! Before he died, my father told me 'Sang-goo, you should behave as if I'll be watching over you from Heaven.' This is the original that I took from Moon. I knew it. Then why'd you need a video from the villa? Why do you think Kim Jong-il developed a nuclear bomb? If this file is ground-to-air missiles, what would the video clip be? A nuclear bomb! This wasn't my original plan, but this should do for revenge. I'll go to the Maldives to sip Mojito. You get the fuckers and put them in jail. You're telling me to do it alone? The file can be taken as evidence only when the source is revealed. You're telling me to go to jail? Arrest would be inevitable but isn't it true that you're not 100% innocent? Fuck you! I want revenge, not justice! I'm sorry but that's the only way to get them. You think I'm that stupid? Fuck justice. I know you're doing this to make your name. You want to be on a roll after arresting Jang! What is wrong with that? I want to go up by jailing bad guys since I have no connections! Is that so wrong? Didn't you go to Lee wanting to make it big! And you are left out like a deserted dog! - Are you fucking crazy, bastard! - Don't you get it? You fucking don't get it yet? It's Editor Lee, not Jang! Lee was the one who set up the slush fund... and put Mirae Motors, Hangyul Bank and Jang together! And this! Fucking this! Lee is the one who fucked up your hand, moron! What are you talking about? Want to change the lead? He does whatever he wants instead of following our direction. Imagine what he would demand once he gets there. But will Jang go quietly? Nothing serious to have one more actor. You want to proceed with two tops rather than one? He'll realize when the film ends... that he was only playing the supporting role. Editor, do you realize how much I've already invested in him? And you're saying I should invest in Kim again without payback? It's not how businessmen work. And Jang's better at following our instructions than Kim since Jang stinks as much as we do. Isn't it better to fart among those who stink? Excuse me. Hello. It's me. I'm feeling lonely and thinking of you. How have you been? Where are you? Get prepared, the operation will start soon. I warned you before... you could get fucked up if you keep licking Jang's ass. You got a copy, do you? You need a bullet to load the gun. I can help you if you want revenge. How much did you get for raising the slush fund? Did they promise you the prime minister job? Bro! How could you do this to me? You matched Mirae Motors up with Hangyul Bank... And it's you who got Jang to put the pressure on the loan! You motherfucker! I was a damn fool to give you the file... No wonder I lost my hand. You keep it for me. We'll see what good it might bring us. Don't release it without my consent, got it? What a foxy bear. You should know your place, instead of coveting what's not yours. Sang-goo, just follow my lead. Take care, it's quite cold. So you planned all this? Using me? You think you can hide all your life watching this bullshit? What do you want me to do? Go to jail? It's the only way to get that son of a bitch, Lee. It's your call. What do you want? How will people remember me? How do you want to be remembered? A gangster who loved... No... stood by justice? Don't smirk. Damn, I should go to the beauty salon... and get a new suit too. A nice one. I got this from Moon Il-seok, former accountant at Mirae Motors. It shows Mirae made a slush fund with 3 billion from Hangyul Bank and gave 30 million to Congressman Jang for his election campaign. Today, the prosecution raided Mirae Motors and Hangyul Bank. According to a source... Ahn who unveiled Mirae Motors' slush fund was arrested and imprisoned in Seoul Detention Center. Ahn is accused of abduction, imprisonment and extortion. Ahn claims he only followed the orders of Chairman Oh and Congressman Jang. The prosecution will conduct a cross-examination. Today at a press conference, Congressman Jang said he will defy the prosecution's summons. My conscience is clear before the people of this country. I have never received money or favors from Mirae Motors. I can stake my political life on it. In the evening today, Oh, Chairman of Mirae Motors was suddenly hospitalized for a chronic disease. Oh 's attorney requested the prosecution to postpone the summons. It's been reported that Mr. Jo at Mirae Motors has left the country. His actions has raised doubts that he left in order to escape. However, Mirae Motors announced that this was scheduled for months. And that Mr. Jo will voluntarily appear at the Prosecution's Office. Lord, shed me some insights. Strong memories lack judgement Then, shall we begin the show? The water tastes okay? Sorry, so many cases to handle. Hope you feel comfortable here. My ass hurts after sitting for so long. - Thank you for the article. - Which article? Prosecution's forced interrogation caused Seok's suicide. - I think it was here... - Yes. Why'd you kill him? I know you killed him by scratching a pen with your right hand, didn't you? You're out of line. Please ask questions based on facts only. Enough fiction. Only facts then. No time anyway. Are you happy to live kissing the asses of Jang and Oh? Fuck... who kisses whose ass? Or not, whatever. I saw you were quite active in the democratic movement before... Even went to prison. How come you're here now? And you? Why are you here? Why'd you come here stringing along that idiot Ahn. I guess it's the same reason. We're both here because of what we desire. But I, at least, am not as dirty as you. Whatever. You introduced Ahn to Jang and Oh, didn't you? No, I didn't. Why would a conglomerate head and a politician need to meet a thug? Doesn't make sense. No? Then let me see... 'Errand men' were hired to suppress the strike of Mirae Motors in 1995, then for the campaign of New Party in 1996's general election, and for Mirae Motors' purchase of a factory site in 1998. Now does it make sense? People often use the phrase, It's hard to see it as... They write this often in interrogation dossiers and in newspaper articles. But do you realize it's nothing but wordplay? It's hard to see it as pre-planned. Hard to see it as intentional. Hard to see it as related. And, "Hard to see it as a request." But how would that be applied to a gangster like Ahn? It's possible to see it as pre-planned. It's possible to see it as intentional. It's possible to see it as related. It's possible to see it as a request. Or we might even say, 'highly' possible. What the fuck are you trying to say? I'm saying, what is "hard to see it as" for one person can be highly possible to see it as for someone else. Words are power. What kind of crazy fuck would believe a thug's words? It's already time for the morning paper. Can I read it? Ahn Sang-goo who revealed Mirae Motors' slush fund hired a hit man in 2001 to assassinate a member of a rival gang. A killer named Choi who was hired for the job is currently in Daejeon Prison. This was revealed in testimony by a man named Park who used to be the manager of Ahn's gang. In addition, the suicide of popular dance group member Min Jia in 2004 was allegedly sparked by repetitive sexual assaults by Ahn, who was her agent at that time. Members of the group are quoted as sources. Fucking assholes! I told you the truth! Nothing but the truth! It's not the truth that matters. Now, no one believes what you say! We need evidence or witnesses to make people to believe you. Now tell me. Did you or didn't you hire the killer? I did not. You go to Daejeon and ask Choi. And the sexual assault? Min Jia had severe depression then. Ask fellow group member Joo Eun-hye. She'll tell you the truth. I did everything you told me to. You said you wanted to get Jang and I did everything. As I disclosed at the prosecutor's I never introduced Ahn to Oh and Jang. I met Ahn several times when I was doing research. Are you saying Ahn lied? Ahn's past record of contract killing and sexual assaults on his talent is revealed. I'm beyond appalled that the reputations of a respected businessman, a politician and me as a journalist who has always fought for freedom and fairness of speech have been tarnished by the word of a thug. She's been dead for a couple days. Seems she killed herself by carbon monoxide poisoning. And I went to see Choi... he said he was hired by Ahn to kill Kim. It is possible to see this as political manipulation by a certain group which incited Ahn to cause controversy just before the presidential election. Let me modify one sentence. Instead of 'possible,' write it as 'highly possible.' Moon, ex-accounting manager of Mirae Motors, now living in Canada said in a recent press interview that he's never met Ahn and the slush fund that Ahn describes never existed in the first place. If Moon is telling the truth it seems Ahn's claims related to Mirae Motors' slush fund have all been proven false. Therefore it's difficult to see how Oh and Jang might be related to the recent allegations. Damn little punks. Now all eyes have turned to who is behind Ahn's false disclosure. Joo Eun-hye, from the same dance group as the late Min Jia whose suicide was caused by Ahn's sexual assault, was found dead today. Police see the cause of death as suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, and plan to investigate Ahn's possible connection to the case. Take care, Mr. Chairman. Is there any way to save Ahn? Why didn't you check his record? That record was fabricated to get Ahn. None of that is true. The truth doesn't matter anymore. I'm also losing ground within the party. Accepting your proposal has completely ruined me. Damn it. I need to look out for myself. Politics is the survival of the country and the people. And also my survival. Sure. Now I understand what it means. Then, you should also look our for yourself. - Hello, this is Woo... - This is Editor Lee. Are you well? Yeah... I just got a tip-off and am concerned if I should write about it or not... What is it now? You know Jo, president of Joyang Mirae Development, right? Yes, so fucking what? A source said your father received favors and money from him. You check about it and call me back. This is President Jo at Joyang Mirae Development. Nice to meet you. I'm Jo Yang-shik. What did he say? Well... What can he say? D...dad. - Did you take the money? - Jang-hoon? Did you or didn't you take the money? What money are you talking about? You met President Jo at Joyang Mirae Development? You never accepted money, am I right? I didn't accept it. I just borrowed some. Real estate agent Kim introduced him... The Supreme Prosecutors' Office will take Ahn's case. You're suspended for 6 months so leave your ID and get out. So you're laying all the blame on me? Then why did a prosecutor fuck around with a gangster? And did you pick up a sponsor? You know President Jo at Joyang Mirae Development? Goddammit. I should kill myself for supporting a nobody like you. Get your ass out of here, fucker! Chief, I can't leave like this. You know how I struggled to get this far. I was a dog for our organization doing whatever I was told to do. Sir! Please give me one more chance. Then you should've done better. Or been born better. Ahn just escaped! What are you doing, sir? Sir! Sir! Sorry, boss. Boss, please forgive me. I... did it only to survive. Sorry. Who killed Joo Eun-hye? It was Jo... Editor Lee ordered him to do it. Why!? She went to Lee and threatened him. She wanted to get you out of trouble. Cigarette? We'll talk care of Lee Kang-hee. You guys stay out of it. I'll meet him myself. Are you sure? Oh boy... Life it tough, goddamn. Smuggle? It seems many smuggle into the Philippines these days. There are thousands of islands so why not? No one can find you if you go into hiding. Also, it's a poor country so... You can live like a king with a bit of money. Not bad. We used to want to live well like the Philippines in the old days. What happened to us? Okay. Let's get Ahn involved somehow in the article. Add murder, sexual assault and fleeing out of the country. The title will be... Biggest swindler of our time! A Twisted Life. Be as provocative as you can. So, he goes crazy. You agree on this, don't you? Sure, company policy is clear. Yes, I saw the news. It's not really important whether Ahn is arrested or not at this point. Yes, Chairman. Who on earth would believe what Ahn says? Yes. I didn't do anything. It was Ahn's one-man-show. Right. Is it that funny? Me doing a one-man-show? Well... I'll call you later. I have a guest. What brings you here? I thought I should show you how to sword dance. You can come here or shall I go there? Don't be intimidated. Come here. I have something to ask you as a brother. We've known each other for 20 years. I never believed in Oh and Jang but I believed in you. Why? Because we are brothers. We're living in a shitty world but brothers don't stab each other in the back, do they? Sang-goo. That's why I told you to quit. Did you forget that if you nurse a grudge, the knife will be aimed back at you? You're getting off track. You think I'm doing this because you betrayed me? What do you want? Let me ask you... Did you really have to kill Joo? Wasn't me. Did you buy Moon off? And order him to deny giving me the file? I don't know what you're talking about. Let me ask you one last thing. Biggest swindler of our time! Scoundrel who does contract killing and habitual sexual assault! Did that come from you? For what? You want this? You son of a bitch! You think I'm so easy? How dare you come here? You motherfucking gangster! Fuck! You motherfucker! It's Jang! He ordered everything. Killed Joo, and made you into a killer and sex criminal! It was all Jang's idea! Which hand do you use to wipe your ass? Use the one that you've got left. Don't even think about writing. Kim Jung-ho, Criminal Department. Yes, what is the location? Excuse me... I'm here to turn myself in. Did you really have to kill Joo? Wasn't me. Did you buy Moon off? And order him to deny giving me the file? I don't know what you're talking about. It's Jang! He ordered everything. Killed Joo and made you into a killer and sex criminal! It was all Jang's idea! Did you listen to it? Should be enough to catch them all, right? Something's eating you? I'll take care of it from now on, so please take care of yourself. Hey, did you say 'please' to me? Treat me as usual. It feels awkward. You met your father? Be a good son to him while he's alive. If not, you'll regret it later like me. Okay? He ordered everything. Killed Joo and made you into a killer and sex criminal! It's all Jang's... That won't serve as evidence. A confession made under coercion in fear of one's life of course cannot be accepted as evidence. Then why are you here? What would happen if Jang listened to it? Can't imagine he'd be happy. You know how the human mind works. A small doubt grows into deep distrust. And he'd never appoint someone who betrayed him. What did you come to say? Would you be okay if someone else takes the position Jang promised you? You wanna start all over again? You think I am picking a fight? First... send me to the Central Investigation Division at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office. I think it's a must-position for a prosecutor. Friends or enemies, only two options. My service to you. What the prosecution needs now is true reform and renovation for the nation and people, rather than false change to get past its crisis. From now on, we won't submit to any pressure... - Promoted to Supreme Prosecution? - Yes, Central Investigation Division. What shall we do, boss? No need to get nervous. Take it as a blind date. Yes, sir. Isn't Hwang from Gyeongbuk Province? Yes, he's from Gyeongbuk High. - Fellow alumni of Kim Seok-woo? - Yes. The primary is just around the corner but the two are within the margin of error. A scandal between Kim and Hanwoo Development. I did the plot summary. You release it when the time is right. Yes, sir. Hi, Mr. Jo, long time no see. When did you come back? A few days ago. You didn't have to bring the liquor. We have plenty. I didn't want to be empty-handed as this is my first visit. He prepared the Chairman's favorite. Oh, here you all are. - Old foes as new friends. - Now in the same boat. Woo Jang-hoon. I knew we would meet here. I said he and I are similar. And you look good! Thank you, sir. Welcome. Hello. This is Detective Choi, sir. Need to report to you... Why report after everything's done! Who do you think you are calling me directly? Damn motherfucker. Should change the number. Damn moron. Who was it? Never mind. Let's go in. - Let's go, Woo. - Yes, sir. Let's party! In the New Party's primary election today, Jang Pil-woo was selected as his party's candidate for the December presidential election, beating Kim Seok-woo. Ladies and gentlemen, I hereby accept the candidacy expressing my sincere respect for your great choice. From now on, whether you voted for or against me, we are all one. I love you all. Love you! Jang Pil-woo! Jang Pil-woo! I'll begin a new era for a righteous Korea! Yes, boss. - You got it? - Yes, boss. - Can we see the actors? - Clearly! Sons of bitches! Spread it far and wide! It's you, Mr. Woo! Sincere congratulations on your honorary promotion. What brings you here? Are you stalking me? I'm back at Nation Daily. You didn't know? Let's cooperate well. Hold on. Yes, Chief. I'm in the lobby. Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's. No, not at all. Take your time. No, not at all. Take your time. What's this? Chairman, I'll pick up your shit from now on! - Yes, you get it and eat it! - You eat it! Nation Daily... - What? - No, it's... - I'm sorry for Seok Myung-kwan. - Sorry for what? He got more than his share... He must've been pissed off. I've nothing to be pissed about. My job is to "do as I'm told." How did you make Moon Il-seok change his mind? When I gave him money, he said he'd do anything for me. There's nothing money can't get. Technically, it's the bank's money. The bank's money is my money! There's no one who didn't use my money! Lee, you write and eat thanks to my money. And fuck, too! Breaking news. A video clip was dispersed among the public this afternoon. After acquiring the video clip which was spread via mobile phones and emails, police have started an investigation. Shown naked in the clip, to the nation's shock, are Mirae Motors Chairman Oh Hyun-soo and presidential candidate Jang Pil-woo. Furthermore, the clip provides evidence that the discredited allegations concerning Mirae Motors' slush fund all appear to be true. As attention focuses on who spread the clip, an inside man who claims to be the source will disclose further details in a press conference, which is likely to release further controversy. There's no information on him yet, and he hasn't arrived. Rumor says it's the president of Jang's campaign club. It's supposedly the man who supplies girls to Oh's villa. It's likely his enforcer who carries out all the errands. Would they believe me if I had evidence? Well, who on earth would believe a gangster? But they'd believe you, don't you think, Mr. Prosecutor? Let's make a film together. Listen to me carefully. I'll escape today. It's all Jang's idea! He ordered everything. You wanna get Jang and Oh with Lee's confession? You think I am an idiot? Don't you know that a confession made under coercion in fear of one's life cannot be accepted as evidence? When I get Lee's confession, you go and make a deal with it. A deal? My good service to you. Yes, you make a deal and jump on their wagon. Mr. Jo, it's been a while. Didn't have to bring the liquor. We've got plenty. If you want to catch a tiger, you have to go in its cave. So you're telling me to become an insider? Either catch a tiger as an insider, or live like a loser in the countryside. It's your call. I wanted to see for myself. So I decided to become an inside man. Mirae Motors Chairman Oh Hyun-soo, presidential nominee Jang Pil-woo, and Lee Gang-hee, Editor-in-chief of Nation Daily deceived the entire nation without hesitation or shame, for nothing but their own benefit. As you can see from the clip, they made Ahn Sang-goo who revealed their true nature into the biggest swindler of our time. Ahn once did unforgivable things working for them but that doesn't mean we can regard what he says as false. Ahn regretted his actions, took everything he saw and heard, and exposed it as the truth. Shit... I'm fucked. Oh bought off Moon, ex-accounting manager of Mirae Motors and ordered him to lie. This is the slush fund file that Ahn received from Moon. And it is genuine. You were also in the clip yourself. Can you disclose your name and occupation? My name is Woo Jang-hoon. Prosecutor of Korea. When the insider turned out to be prosecutor Woo Jang-hoon, at CID of Supreme Prosecutors' Office, it caused quite a stir. Politicians are calling for a thorough investigation of the agency. Today's revelation by an inside man disclosed the deep-rooted back scratching relationship between politics, industry and the media. Congressman Jang is maintaining silence while disobeying the prosecution's summons. The prosecution is said to be considering putting an all-points bulletin on Jang, who is already banned from leaving the country. I am so fucking lonely. Jo, you son of a bitch! You like this? You want more? You fucking asshole! What? What the fuck are you saying? You bastard! Whatever, empty that! Yes, sir! Go fuck yourself! Asshole... Good bye, asshole. 6 MONTHS LATER Lawyer Woo's office, how may I help you? He's in court now. Yes, when he gets back I'll tell him to call you. Excuse me, you're not allowed to smoke here. But adultery laws were abolished early this year! It's not me who abolished it. Why yell at me? Hey, gangster! Damn rude bastard... Very nice view. I guess they fed you well in prison. You look... awful. You still don't watch your mouth. Having fun after quitting the prosecutor's office? Of course not. I miss the days I got my monthly pay. You gonna stay here forever? You need to groom a bit and go there across the river. You must've received love calls from the congress. Woo Jang-hoon, lonesome hit man of justice. You're saying I should follow in Jang's footsteps? To fail or to succeed. You'll never know unless you start. Are you scared? If so, I can go myself. Screw you. Let me treat you a decent meal. I liked the food I had in prison. Or since the weather's nice, - we can have Mojito at the Maldives. - That sounds good too. Where is the Mojito? - Damn. - I know, I know! It's in Japan! You make me crazy. Or in China? LEE BYUNG-HUN CHO SEUNG-WOO BAEK YUN-SHICK Directed by WOO MIN-HO Any characters, places, company or organization mentioned in the movie and every events and episodes are all fiction and made up. If any of those really exist it's all a coincidence. Yes? Yes. Prison food wasn't so bad. I had time to think. It was okay. You tried chewing dry squid? But the squid is very tough to chew. Will you keep chewing it? I thought so. Who would keep chewing it when it hurts your teeth. It's all the same. All they want is something they can chew on at parties and on the internet. They will chew on it but get bored and move on. Teeth hurts and they're busy with other matters. That's right. We just have to stay strong and be tough. Koreans tend to be hot-headed. We boil up quick but get cold fast. Just throw them something to chew on time to time. What they want... it's not the truth. Throw some concerns to those who want concerns. Give a baby reason to cry if the baby wants to cry. And throw some gossip to those who want to speak ill. After concerning and crying and swearing they'll blow some steam off and get tired eventually. Pardon? My right hand? I can write with my left hand.
