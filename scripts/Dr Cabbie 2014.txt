It Let me show you Don't be shy $1 # What I love and what I like # - How many times I tell you, no doing sex here in my house! I'm not doing sex in your house. Hey! Who's that? - Where? - Where! The signer... The signer... What do you have in your mouth? Bubble gum. Bubble gum? Show me! # Boy make you want me # What time is it? - What's up, Love Muffin? - Yeah? Colin, I told you to clean up this baby mess! - The press is on us like diaper rash! Get on it now! - Yeah, OK. No, I heard you, Dad. Yeah, I'll deal with it. - New! I said I'll deal with it. OK, bye! Hey, what's going on? - Cancel my massage. And get me a nice gift for a newborn, and the newspaper, and some breakfast, and a scotch, and a cup of coffee. Stupid baby! - Thank you, doctor. - Of course! - So, whatever happened between you and him? - Him who? - The baby's father. - Colin. - Mm-hmm. Well... I was a young lawyer, and I thought he had everything: career, looks, charm. He asked me to look over his briefs, and I thought he meant legal papers. A week later, he stopped calling me Pumpkin, and then no more calls. - What happened when you told him you were pregnant? - He asked me whose it was, and had me kicked out of the firm. Thanks to him, I serve coffee for a living now. Mmm! I have no idea who it is. One second. - Daddy's home! - What are you doing here? I come bearing gifts. Something for Mommy, something for little Colin Jr. Uh, where is he? Is he inside? Little Colin Jr.! His name is Ganesh! - G-g-gesundheit! Sorry. What did you say? - I'm serious. - Ganesh? Really? Is that a vindaloo dish at a cheap Indian takeout? Here,these are for you. - It means "god of all things auspicious, remover of obstacles. " - Oh... Oh hey, hi! We didn't order a cab. How did you get in here? Don't be a jerk! This is the man who delivered my baby. This is Deepak. - Thank you very much! - It's fine! - Oh! Hold these for a second, 'cause I have something for you. I wanted to thank you. It's your delivery fee. - Please don't do that! - I gotta go. - Thank you very, very much! - Get the hell out of my house! - OK. Look, I don't know what's going on with you two, but the cabbie can drive you to the showroom, but he can't buy you the Dior handbag. The good things in life need the good money, and you know that. Think about it. (On phoney Dr. Cabbie, it's Edith, uh, Mrs. Robinson. Yeah, I think somethings wrong. - It's good to see you again, Mrs. Robinson. - Thank you, doctor. - OK! Let's take a look. Mrs. Robinson, you need to see an ophthalmologist right away. - My health plan only allows that once a year. It'll have to wait. - How about we end our date with a drive to the hospital? Now, Mrs. Robinson, blood pressure medication, Ramipril, once a day. Oh, son, you're taking a huge risk. Shall we? They're so big! I know! You can have them too! - Socks! - Yeah, socks! No one has to know! All right! Underneath, so like... - Like that? - Oh, yes! So it's like boobies! All right! - The tea, is it hot? - Put this over there! Come on! - OK! They're gonna be here soon, guys! - Look at these gulab jamun. They're completely cold! Go and microwave them, then! - Why do it now? - Please! OK, I think it looks... Come on, Rani, put this over there! Yeah! - Hello, family! - They're here! on! - Ah, Natalie! Welcome to our home! Yeah! - Natalie, can I have the baby? - Oh, our little, white Ganesh! - My little Ganesh! Just look at him! - Come, come! - Look at him! That's what you said, "Look at him!" Hi, guys! Open your eyes, baby! He's a darling! Little baby nose! His eyes are just like Deepu's! Look! How did that happen? - That's because we're all connected by an akashic field. - Of course! - You know, Deepu's never had a girlfriend before. Oh, nice boy! You're so lucky! I had to kiss a lot of frogs before I found my maharaja! " Me! Where, um... where'd you find him? Well... - Oh! Try the gulab jamun! - Brown balls? Yeah! They're very good. - Trust me, once you go brown, you'll never frown. So true. Promise! 'Huh? Do it, Deepu! Do it! - Huh'? Yeah, OK! Uh, Mrs. Chopra, you must be so proud to have such a caring, compassionate son. - So, you mean I don't have to worry about Deepu's marriage anymore? - Ma! Joking! You're so lucky! I always told the studmuffin, "Let a nice girl dance into your heart... "Not the back of your cab. " Funny! He's so funny! - Did, uh... did Rani dance her way into your heart? Uh... Yes, Uncle, tell us! - OK... - Come on! It was so long ago! Tell them, honey! Tell them! - It was the 90s. - Yeah! I'd been here 3 years. The government was sending me back to India on urgent business. But before I left, there was one thing I simply had to do: watch Renee Rogers dance at my favourite venue for the performing arts. - You? - I know! I bought a front-row orchestra seat. Big money! That night, Rani was Eve, and the stage was her garden. Remy Yeah! Like magic! Such poise, such artistry... Oh, honey! He's so sweet! - The finer details of her costume filled my eyes with wonder. Silky! I was so moved... ...I was ready to... pop... the question. So romantic! Marry me, babe! Please! Make me the happiest man alive, darling! Ah! Looks like I just did! - Hmm! - That's so romantic! That's so sweet! - You know, Viju, I always say, "When in Rome, do the Romans!" I did! " Hmm? # Don't don't don't you want me... # I hope you're ready, doctor! Yeah! Come on! - Mimi, no! No, Mimi! Sexy doctor! # Don't you want me # it Let me show you Don't be shy $1 # What I love and what I like # No, Mimi! Please! Please! # I'm really feeling you tonight # Tony, wake up! Mmm! # Boy make you want me # Hey! It Let me show you Don't be shy $1 # Don't be shy # Please! Tony! ' Deepak! " No! Mimi! Mimi! - Natalie, Natalie, look, I've stopped drinking. I'm... I'm cleaning up my act. Look, I know I've been an ass, and I do not expect you to forgive me, OK? Hear me out! Hear me out! Look, look, I'll... I'll understand if you say no. Can I just hold my son? Oh! Look at that smile! - Oh! That's the most beautiful face I've ever seen. ' Hmm! - We do good work! - Hmm! Whoa! Broke a window! You've done a very good job. Our backers are very pleased! - Ah... - The media is loving our family-man spin. - Yeah, but it's killing my mojo. Excuses, excuses! - There's 3 things you need to win an election: money, media and minorities. Come on, Bonnie! # In Napoli... # So, welcome to my home! Well, upstairs... I live upstairs. - Oh, OK! # Here's what they say # it When the Moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie $1 # That's amore # it When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine $1 # That's amore # # Bells will ring... # - Antipasto. - Thank you! Thank you! No octopussy? - No... no octopussy today, Mimi. - Octopussy? - It's Mimi's special. Mmm! - Thank you! - You're welcome! Hmph! Please! Oh! So, uh... my family is having this really small birthday party for me next week, and... and we would just love for you to be there. - Of course! I'd love that. So, what can I get for the birthday boy? - Well, a residency in a hospital would be great. How's it going on that front? - Good! You know, actually, I've applied to some US schools and... Um, you know, it's such a long shot and... - No, that's great! Really! - Yeah! And I might not even go by the end. - You gotta do what you gotta do, right? Yeah! Hi, Tony! I'm sorry, boss! Hey! Miss? Look, miss, we've... Look, we've all had our bad days. Miss? - Leave me alone! Go away! This bridge... It's not high enough to kill anyone. You're just gonna wake up in the hospital, broken bones, face mangled beyond recognition. Don't get close, or I'll jump! - I can give you a ride to a taller bridge, huh? My... my cab is right there. Go away! I'm going. I'm in love. And I'm pregnant. My boyfriend... is a white guy. If my family finds out... Stay right where you are! I'm in love too. And she's a white girl. And I'm not sure she sees a future with me. I get it. What are you doing about it? I'm trying to build bridges... not jump off them. What's her name? Natalie. Boring! OK! What's yours? Zarah. I'm Deepak. It will kill my parents if they knew! Zarah, if you jump off this bridge, your love ends. But if you walk this way, you can bring hope. You don't wanna kill your love, Zarah. Hey. Hey, come on. You don't wanna do this. - Let me go! God! Please! Please! Come on, Zarah. It's gonna be OK! H's OK. Zarah, promise me you'll tell your family about this. Zarah,these are for you. They'll help keep you calm, and they're perfectly safe during your pregnancy. But just one a day for 2 weeks, OK? I Honey! Hello! - Oh, look at the two of you! - Ah? Ah? Ah! - Real good, Britney Spears! Yay, Britney! On! My, my! - Look at this! Huh'? All me. Yeah. Oh,wow! Oh, Natalie! There you are. - I didn't even recognize you. Oh, hi! 'Hi! - My hair, you mean. That's all Rani. Yeah, thank you! Come on, come on! - Shame on you! Oh, shame! - Come dance! - Where, um... where is the birthday boy? - on! - Where is Deepak? That's right. Where is he? Where is he? Champagne for everybody! # For he's a jolly good fellow # # For he's a jolly good fellow # # For he's a jolly good fellow # # Which nobody can deny # # Uh-huh # # Really # # Come on # Happy birthday, Dr. Cabbie. Hey.)'- . Hey- - So, I, uh... I thought you said it was a small party. It's not that big. By Indian standards. Oh, right. You've been running away from me all night. Natalie, look, it's... it's OK. I... I may never end up being a doctor again, and could just be a cabbie for the rest of my life. - Wait... What are you talking about? I saw the pictures in the newspaper. Listen, he tricked me. He planted those pictures for his potential campaign, and... I should've known better. Colin can offer you the world. He can, and he did. But I have my own. Tony! Tony! Whoo-hoo! - Hey! - No! No! What are you doing? # Uh-huh # # Uh-huh mm-hmm # What's going on? Deepak Chopra, you are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can or will used against you in a court of law. You have a right to an attorney... Don't worry! ...one will be appointed to you. Do you understand your rights? Please! Tony! No, please! Where are you taking him? Please, listen to me! This is a mistake! Zarah's life hangs by a thread. So does Dr. Cabbie's fate. Once the darling of the city, he could now face up to 15 years in jail on charges ranging from impersonating a doctor to dispensing controlled drugs without a license and criminal negligence causing bodily harm. The cabbie from India who fought for his hospital residency may be fighting for his own residency in this country. Please, please! I'm here today to offer support, I'm hereto offer sympathy, and more than anything, to find solutions to help this shattered family and this outraged city. Well, after this Dr. Cabbie's trial, on behalf of the Mahmoods, our law firm is gonna launch a civil suit that will make sure that this hard-working, immigrant family... never has to work another day in their lives. Thank you. That's all for now. One question! Your lawyer's here. Hey! What are you doing here? I'm hereto see you, idiot! I, um... I started my own law firm today. As your first patient, I'd like to ask you if you'd be my first client. - Natalie, I do not want to drag you into all of this. - Deepak, I dragged myself into this the moment I set foot in your cab. You're wasting your time. - Do you believe you did the right thing by treating those people? Drop it! It's over. Maybe I was wrong about you. Maybe you don't believe what you did was right. Maybe you're not the man I thought you were. I'm not. Attorney Wilman! Please wait! Sign here. I'm gonna need a lot of autographs. By the way, really liking the stubble, doc. Bail was set at $25,000. Your uncle took care of it. Before you sign this rookie who is going up against a 28-year veteran, just know that there's always a risk. Like, a risk that you may never be a doctor again. We're in this together. Hey... Hmm! Wilcher! - Uh-huh'? - Wilchie! - Uh-huh'? These pics are great. Here you go. The cops have been following this guy for months. - You nail this cabbie, I'll make you my chief legal officer when I'm elected mayor. Look, I don't care how you do it,just... get Dr. Rickshaw sent back to wherever the hell it is he came from. - Dr. Curry will be sent home in a hurry. Not to worry. - That's racist. - Uh... - I gotta keep this stupid family-man act up till after the election. I just want him out of Natalie's life. Hey, listen, talking about your baby-mama, I hear she wants to play lawyer. Is she any good? - Oh, Natalie's very, very good. She used to work under me. I like a good fight. Oh, you mean as a lawyer? Pfft! No, I... I wouldn't worry about her. Lawyer! Hey. you all right? Deepu? Deepu... Hi, Deepu! - Natalie! Natalie, are you ready? Are you ready? - Papa's with you! - It's all gonna be OK. Papa's with you! Sir? Natalie Wilman. Hmm... - Hey! Come here, come here. You know what? I'm actually in a pretty generous mood today, so, uh, you get your client to plead guilty... ...to impersonating a doctor, then I'll drop all the other charges. What do you say? - He's innocent, and pleading guilty means deportation. - Ah! - So no deal. All rise! Mr. Chopra, how do you plead? I object, Your Honour. - Miss Wilman, normally you only object to things he says. Objecting to what the judge says can seriously offend him. - Your Honour, you referred to my client as Mr. Chopra. He's a certified doctor and deserves to be addressed as such. Mr. Chopra? Not guilty, Your Honour. - Yes! Not guilty! - Shhh! What are you doing? OK. Let's go! After putting Mr. Chopra under surveillance, I found a full medical clinic, client charts and prescription drugs like oxycodone, morphine and lorazepam. - But Dr. Chopra said it was a symptom of retinal detachment, and he dragged me off to the ER. - And was his diagnosis accurate? Well, the specialist said if I had waited, I would've lost my eye. Thank you. - You are saying that you paid Mr. Chopra $50 as payment for medical services. Yes, but it was a tip! For medical services. Yes or no? Yes or no, Mrs. Robinson? - Yes. - Thank you. Thank you very much for clarifying that. - I came here thinking I could make a difference. What have I done? I've shamed our family. I've ruined Papa's legacy. - Deepu, there are 3 things that can never be hidden: The Sun, the Moon and the truth. And the truth is you help people, Beta. Not everybody thinks so. Well, then, they're mean. But you know what they say about mean people? That they come back in their next life as a fly and eat poop! Here we go. Tony, don't be nervous. Just be yourself, OK? - So, what was this, then? A little side-business you two had going? Uh... See, as brownies, we'll do a lot for an extra buck, huh? We'll, uh... cut your hair with one hand and we'll cut your taxes with the other. Asking me to deliver a baby in the back of my cab for an extra $20, I mean, that's a little much, even for us, huh? Thank you very much. That was a compelling comedy routine. Uh, you know... Deepak, man, he saved 2 lives in the cab. Two lives! He's a hero. Our hero. - Mr. Donaldson, what did Dr. Chopra prescribe you? Herbal medicine and hope. What's the matter with all you stupid, smart people? There's a lot of people in this country! They need doctors! And you've got your heads so far up your asses, you can't see you got a really good one sitting right there in front of you?! I'm on my way out, but he just might save your life one day! You're gonna beat it, kid! You gotta grab 'em by the balls and enjoy the ride! Your Honour, please! - The defence calls Zarah Mahmood to the stand. - Zarah, you swallowed the whole bottle of antidepressants. Why'? - When I overheard my mom and dad say... that I had shamed them... they would rather die... I decided to take my own life... ...to let them live. - Now, tell us the night that you contemplated suicide, did Mr. Chopra... did he call 911? - No. - No. Did he call social services? - No. - Did he call your parents? - No. - Zarah, did Dr. Chopra, in any way, influence your decision to take your life? He saved my life. - But he did give you a bottle of illegal prescription drugs. Is that correct? - Yes. - Zarah, Mr. Chopra was an irresponsible young man who failed in his basic civil duty. - Objection, Your Honour! - Sustained! - I stand corrected, sir. Thank you, Zarah. Careful, Mr. Wilcher. - My parents used to bring me here when I was little. I like to come out here when I miss them. Look at each plane. So many different people, so many different dreams. How many of them actually come true? - Your dream of becoming a doctor has turned into a real nightmare, huh? I was bound by an oath that Hook. You always keep your promises? Yeah, of course. Can you tell me how you justify... a tip that is 5 times your cab fare? - Sir, from what I understand, in some professions, people charge $50 for just 5 minutes of service. Prostitutes. Lawyers. ; Order! - I'm glad that you're having a good time here, Mr. Chopra, but tell me, there are millions of needy in India, yet you fly 7,000 miles to come here and treat people for free? I came hereto heal people, no matter where they come from. That's very, very moving, and so sincere. But tell me, did you at any time know that what you were doing was illegal? - I had taken an oath... - Yes or no, Mr. Chopra? Yes. Yes, I did. Thank you, Mr. Chopra. You may step down, Mr. Chopra. Mr. Chopra, you may step down. I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment... - Uh, we're finished with the witness. - Please, Your Honour! - May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling... and may I long experience the joy of healing those who may seek my help. I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being. I will remember that I remain a member of society with special obligations to all human beings. I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk. I will remember that warmth, sympathy and understanding... may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug. I will no! permit race, religion, nationality or social standing intervene between my duty and my patients. If I do not violate this oath, may I be respected while I live, remembered affectionately thereafter. Your Honour, may I? Dr. Chopra, what did you just recite? - The Hippocratic Oath. - Why'? Because I swore to it. - Dr. Chopra, do you believe that what you did was right? With all my heart, yes. And had I not done so, I would've betrayed my profession... and everything I believe in. Thank you. Your Honour. - Do you want our great medical system to be run by cabbies? No. I urge you to disregard Mr. Chopra's celebrity status and his phony philanthropy, and keep in mind his utter contempt for the law. Dr. Chopra is a doctor of medicine. He upheld an oath... that transcends borders, languages, cultures. Members of the jury, I ask you: what if you were in the back of that cab? Would you find this man guilty if I! was your life that he saved? What if it was the life of your child? Cabbie! Cabbie...! We love you, Dr. Cabbie! Cabbie! Cabbie...! We love you, Dr. Cabbie! We love you! Any comment, please! I'm trying to get you to deliver my baby! We love you! Has the jury reached a verdict? Yes, we have, Your Honour. - On the charge of impersonating a doctor, what say you? Not guilty. - On the charge of criminal negligence causing bodily harm? Not guilty. - And possessing and dispensing controlled drugs without a license? Guilty. - Members of the jury, thank you for your time. - Your Honour, the prosecution recommends a minimum 4-year jail term, after which, since Mr. Chopra is not a citizen of our country, we recommend that he be deported. You can't do that! - Order! Idiot! - I'll pronounce the sentence in 2 hours. All rise! Excuse me... Come on. We don't have much time. - Where are we going? - You'll see. Natalie! Natalie,just... Listen, w...! Where are we going? - Your Honour, I'd like to present important evidence before sentencing the accused. - Miss Wilman, evidence comes before the guilty/not-guilty thing. It's against my better judgment, but you may proceed. - Your honour, I ask you to consider the value Dr. Chopra's deportation would serve his new wife and child. - Mr. Chopra was a bachelor when this trial started. What am I missing? Well... Shhh! You ready, boss? Come on! Come on! Hi! - Hi! Do you have the marriage license? - Yeah, here you go. - Marriage license? Yeah, you signed that when you signed me. Always read the fine print, Dr. Chopra. Nervous? Me too. It's my first time. - Do you want me to marry you only so I can stay in this country? - No, I... want you to marry me because you love me. " No! Idiot! What is he doing? Is there an objection? Yes! I... I object. Deepu, don't! I'm sorry, I... I can't marry you. No! Not like this. Deepu!! Natalie... I don't know what tomorrow will bring... but with you as my wife and Ganesh as my son, I know I can face it. I promise to love you both forever. Will you marry me? Of course I will! I'm so happy! And... now we're happily married. Thank you, Miss Wilman. Prescribing drugs without a license has meant ruin for many before you. But I see more gain in sentencing you to 500 hours of community service... ...than putting you in jail. And you will not practise without a license. Considering your deep family ties in this country, it is this court's decision not to deport you. We did n! This court is adjourned. Good job, everybody! Good job, everybody. Good job! - on! Ah! Ah! - We did it! - Let's go, let's go! Rani! Rani, let's go! This is a good thing, right? Oh my gosh! - Oh, Deepak! I love you! I love this guy! All right, let's eat! Yes, yes, yes! Come on, let's go! Natalie! Wow! So vicious, but sexy! Seriously, so much sexier since my baby tumbled out of your vagina. That's a compliment! OK, you know what? You wouldn't have given Slum Doc here a second chance if he hadn't seen your powdered kitty in the back of the cab. - Leave it, Deepak. He's drunk. What did you say? I said, "Birdie Num Num Num Num. " Oh! Oh God! - Are you OK? - Yeah, well, he just punched... - Dick! - Why does that feel good? I like that. I don't know why. Oh God, that feels... - As I was saying, how does a honeymoon in India sound? I'd love to see the Taj Mahal with you. Ah! # Come on # Dr. Chopra to radiology. Dr. Chopra, radiology. - How are you feeling, honey? - Fine. - I told you false alarms, Braxton Hicks contractions, nothing else. - Honey, I'd just really like to give birth in a hospital this time, you know what I'm saying? - You got it. - You don't want me to fall in love with another cabbie, do you?
