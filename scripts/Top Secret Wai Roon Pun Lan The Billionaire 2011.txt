OK, in one sentence say something that will make me want to pay attention. Ittipat Kulpongwanich Just ignore what you see in front of you and please listen to me first. My name is My name is Herculiz74, and you? Hey Top, give me the fire blade. I want 10 million UB for it. Set the paper margins to 1.5 for Top and Bottom. Once the margins are set type the information you have into MS Word. (I've already discounted the price so no bargaining.) Make sure you typed your name correctly. Hi, Hercules, Could you please sell dragon boots 4 me? Dude help me. I need it to kill the dragon in the cave. Get me my money, or find the blade yourself. You already got everything, nothing left. Jack, talk to you later. Bigtoe is asking to buy something from me. Shit! Really? No sell. The shoe hard to find. I have only one. C'mon man, I'll give you I want 40 million I want 50 million. Hey. 500 SGD, OK? Give me your bank account. I'll transfer right now Jack, what does SGD stand for? Singapore Dollar. Yes, and that's 12,000 Baht! (US$400) Weren't you worried giving your bank account to a stranger? No. It's all good. Crinum Lily is blossoming in the field... May I borrow your bank book? Why are you using my bank book? I got 50,000 Baht in mine, you only have 1,500 Baht Let's see what will happen. Sweeeeeeeet. Here you go. Whoa! I still have 8 more dragon boots and 43 shields Another 40 blades and 17 armored suits This is... awesome! THE BILLIONAIRE What are the extras for luxury model? That's it? Just for a down payment, then that's it. Where did you get so much cash? I'm an arms dealer. You can't get in without a parking sticker. Here is your sticker. Reserved for School Director No more excuses. You can go now. Ittipat, give me your parent's number. Gosh professor, please don't call them. How about you deduct 40 merit points and call it a day. I don't think you have any points left. May I donate money for a new neon sign for the school? Are you trying to bribe me? No, sir. I just want to help out our school. They call this bribery. My goodness, why can't you be like your siblings. They graduated and got great jobs working in China. How are you going to earn a living, Ittipat? You're enjoying this, right? The whole school knows. But only you get to sit in the car. Yeah right. We can't park here. Let's go. Here's a parking spot. You want noodles with extra crab, right? Hey Top! To go. Okay. - How much? - 280 Baht. Top! I got your favorite chestnuts too. Okay let's just go. Is dad home already? Yes since this evening. Is he sleeping? Yeah. Is this your car? Yup. Move dad's car back. That should make enough room for mine. Top. Top. Press the top button. Press it. Hurry! If you keep spending money like this. You will go broke. Go return your car tomorrow. Top, are you betting on soccer games? I already told you I make money from my online games. How? I already explained and you just don't get it. Top If you don't graduate, you will be really sorry! I'm telling you. All I ask of you is to study so don't make us worry. Examination Results Examination ID Code Sorry. Not accepted. Whoa, so awesome. Super clear image. There're many new games out and it can play movies too. For real? Yup. But for movie lovers then this one is better. Made in China, only It can't hurt to try. Just get a new one if it breaks. And how much is the PS2? Please don't bargain, I barely marked it up. C'mon. I won't even shop around. Fine 24,500, deal? What about no discount and give me this DVD player for free. No, can't give it away for free. It's 800 Baht. Alright then I will shop around then. Hey bro! Okay. Okay. It's a deal. Top! Mom... You want to play games together? Hold on. How about your entrance exam results? I got accepted, but in a private university. It's not that bad, mom. The tuition fee is around 50,000-60,000 Baht It's not that expensive. Please look after this client for me. No problem, sir. Bye. Okay. Thanks. Just go to community college. - Mom... private university is... - You didn't study hard, no time to be ashamed now. I will take care of myself then. I have the money. I don't need yours. Dad, what are we going to do about Top? Let him go to community college. Community college? That's even worse. He might not graduate. If he worked hard, I wouldn't mind the cost. You should understand how our son is. You always baby him like this. No wonder he's a brat. I won't allow it. He will go to a private university. Do you realize how bad the economy is now? But his education is really important! That's enough. Your account was deleted, Due to your commercial use outside the Game. Damn it. You can't ban me now! Hey, what's up? Do you still have those 300 Baht DVD players? I want to buy a lot of them. Don't try to play me. 800 Baht is my wholesale price. Last time you were going to sell the PS2 for 24,500, right? But I paid 25,000 with free DVD player. That means you still profit at 500 Baht. So the cost price must be lower than 500 Baht. Man, business is in your blood. So how much is a lot exactly? I thought you were going to buy 1,000 of them. Alright I will sell it to you for 500, take it or leave it. Oh so you are opening a DVD player factory. Not quite. This is just the beginning of my story. What? Just the beginning? Going to take long? Please pay close attention. Are you finished? Didn't even hit send yet. I'm listening but make it short. Okay. My mom yelled at me for that. Why didn't you spend the money on school? Clear image, with remote control. And you will enjoy it even more while watching your favorite film. Shit! I almost got kick out of the house, when the DVD player broke. Everybody knows generic goods last all but a few days. They are broken. Give me new ones. No exchanges. They have no warranty. Why not!? you call disposable DVDs. Why didn't you tell me before? Only stupid people don't know this. I could sue you, you know that! Go cry to your parents. Here take it! Shit! This won't even cover half the money you cheated me. Dad, I'm going home, you need a ride? Selling really isn't as fun as playing online games. I could have sold all of them if I wasn't conned. Welcome to the real world. When you lose, you can lose everything. Even adults can barely survive. Kids are no exception to this reality. I'm paying you to study. Anywhere you want. I am not one of your employees, dad. Today we will learn about the idea behind Generation... That was it. I went back to study. You said your dad paid you to study, but you didn't take it. So how did you get the money to study then? Did you really go to class? Of course I did. How did you pay tuition? You took your dad's money, right? No, I didn't take his money. Really. You got amulet to sell? Amulet for sale? Do you have amulet for me to appraise? Sir, I would like to pawn my amulet. Let me see. How much do you want for this? I'll take... Please sir. Help me out it's for tuition. Fine 100,000 it is. I'm all for helping an education. - The money is really for school right? - Of course. OK. That was the first time I ever got into debt... If you think you will be rich, then you will be rich. If you think you will succeed, you will be succeed. Sahaphat company uses this "Urban forest strategy" plan and Sahaphat has succeeded until today. Jack, I can't stand this anymore. Let's go. No, I can't. I'm really need to study. Study my ass. Reading a soccer magazine is how you study? I'm listening. Top, you know our tuition fees aren't getting any cheaper. Here, just hit record for me then. I won't attend this class anymore. I went to class but always thinking about how to get my dad's amulet back. Your turn. Anyone here who can't follow the rules will be punished. Therefore all of you will do some public service work by cleaning up the trash in front of this building for the next 3 days starting today. Right now. Please proceed. Hey what are you doing here? What do you mean by that? No I meant. Don't you have class today? I have class but no Lin. So I rather ditch class with Lin. You can't have me either way because I have class. Hey let's go eat those crab noodles, I am starving. I can't. I got rehearsal tonight. We hardly get to meet and you're too busy for me? I am not too busy, but you are just too free. Oh! Hi, can you speak English? A little bit? So, how can I help you here? What is it? / Oh! This is the Salapao Machine. And all the Salapao will come out here. You can have a try. Is it really edible?

And this mixing paddle will churn the chestnuts so that they are heated evenly. We're the first company to import it from Japan. So if I buy it, I will be the first right? Yes the first. How much? It's very expensive. I didn't ask, is it expensive I asked how much? What is it? I'm going to sell chestnuts. This machine automates the baking process so I won't have to break my back. How much did you pay for this? They're selling it for 500,000 Baht. But I rented it for 50,000 Baht a month. I can buy one for 30,000 at the weekend market! That's okay, dad. What's done is done. Last night I dreamed that I saw Guan Yin (The Goddess of Mercy). She carried something black in her hand, must be a good sign. Everything on the whiteboard will be on the exam. If you have any questions or do not understand anything please ask me now. Any questions? Sir why do you soak the chestnuts? So I can tell which ones are spoiled or not. Really? How so? The ones floating are bad. The ones that sink are good. Then what do you do, sir? I churn. And then? Pay money. When trying to gather economic data to analyze you should gather the info from various sources. What do u want, boy? Wow your chestnuts smell great. What type of coffee do you use? Taste it yourself. Pebbles I will quiz you at the end of class, for 10 points. The questions require a lot of details. In my opinion, you must understand this thoroughly before you can graduate from this faculty.

Okay, thank you. The end of this month, one booth is clearing out. If you're interested then you must sign a contract today. I think you should ask your parents first. If you were me, would you take it? This is a prime location. Trust me. The rental fee is 24,000 Baht. You'll earn that in no time. Damn not even one customer! It's still too early to tell. Whose mobile is ringing? Please come out to turn it off. Professor, may I pick up the phone? No you're not allowed to. If you do, I will have to report you cheated. Turn off your mobile phone now.

Okay. Let's open more branches. Slow down Top. This is only our first day. Only 1 day and the sales are through the roof. If we can sell 2 sacks, we'll have 4,000 Baht a day, And if we got 10 branches, we would make over 1.2 million a month! Let's do it. Okay? I think we better not. We can handle it? We're doing it. Why even ask me then? Please move this kiosk next to that one. Please move it a little more. Okay. That's good. Please sign here. - See you at Changwattana branch. - Okay. Set the temperature at 120 degree. Use 2 kg Each time. Don't put too many pebbles because it won't mix well together. - Understand? - Yes. Okay then we can start now. Keep these chestnuts in place. Are we still seeing each other? Who told you? Why did I have to hear this from other people? Have I ever hidden anything from you? If you knew that I'm selling chestnuts, what would you say? Are you ashamed? What kind of a person you think I am? I'm worried about you. Stop this and come back to school. Damn you Jack. Why did you tell Lin about me? I didn't tell her. You disappeared. Lin called, she thought you may be cheating. So I said, I don't know, then she called your mom. And are you coming back to school or what? Your booth is causing damage. The smoke is turning the ceiling yellow. You must do something about it. Smoke is a byproduct of making chestnuts. It is in violation of your rental contract. If you can't fix this then we'll have to cancel your contract. What? Cancel? I am sorry. Hey you can't do that! Do you have a way to fix this? Yes I do. Hey you cannot paint the ceiling now. It is disturbing our customers. You must do it after hours. Mom please hold it steady. It's shaking. I am. I thought I did already. It's almost midnight. If you weren't here, I would have finished already. Are you tired? May I do it for you? Mom, you're not helping. Mister, time's up. You must leave now. Please I need a bit more time. I'm almost done.

No more time, Top. Tomorrow you must go do your passport. By the end of this month we must move to China to stay with your brother and sister. Are we skipping town? How come no one tells me anything? You don't need to know. It's not your concern. How much debt are we in, mom? Mom, tell me how much? Don't worry. Our chestnut business is going well. I'll finish the painting in time. And it will be alright. Just go with us. At least we can be together. Excuse me, please look at the camera. Okay ready... hey! Mom, I am not going. I will stay here and study. Go back to take your photo now. You wanted to pay me to study, right? I'm ready to be your employee now, dad. Fine you can stay if you want. I will go wait inside. Forget about the chestnuts and go back to school. Top. I'm sorry about... I need you to move your booth out. Every branch? All of them. Our boss can't allow this. I am truly sorry. See the paint is dripping on my shoe shelves You ruined my spiritual altar. My glasses have stains too. Will you take responsibility for this? - Look! - All stained, how can we sell them like this? I really like the backdrop Yeah it looks so amazing. I want to see it badly. What wrong with you? Why didn't you pick up my calls? Top! What's wrong? Top? Is it about the chestnuts? Let it be. Top take the entrance exam again. A high school diploma isn't enough. Please Top? I will help you. Okay. Promise me? Let's go to Chinatown. It's been a while. I miss the crab noodles. Bad traffic and no parking though. No problem. I can wait. I just got back from Rayong province. I brought back some fried seaweed. It must be that good you even brought it here to eat. You're crazy. Just drive and I'll feed you some. Don't tell me you fried the seaweed yourself. Then I will go to lunch. See my scars. At first I bought it from Rayong province. But just my luck it all went stale within a week. I can't believe your luck. It gets worse. When I asked if they could do something about it, they said they didn't know how. I pleaded with them for 3 days to try. They didn't care and we ended up arguing. Don't tell me you got your butt kicked again? Hell no! I did all the butt kicking this time. - Yeah they deserve it. - Right? - Right on! - Yeah. In the end I had to fry it myself. So how did you solve the problem? They couldn't. Kasetsart University can. Head of Food Processing & Manufacturing Department You aren't a student here, are you? How did you get them to help? Prof. please ignore what you see before you and let me introduce myself My name is Ittipat Kulpongwanich. So I told the prof the same thing I told you. Some tissues, prof. Your fried seaweeds consume oils just like these crispy rice crackers. Oxidation reacts to oxygen and that causes it to go stale. The solution is vacuum packaging. See, a vacuum removes oxygen out off the bag. Your seaweed is crispy, right? To keep it crispy we put nitrogen in and now we've extended the shelf-life. Yes ma'am. You see. And that's it. So that means I have to buy this machine, correct? Yes, correct. Now it is up to you to find a way to make it delicious. That is all you got for everything? Each box costs 10,000 Baht. Ew, how come it's so bitter? Maybe it's burnt? That's good enough. It's greasy, maybe it absorbed too much oil? Uncle, dinner time. What to do Top? This won't be enough. If not enough, I can get more. Maybe another 5-6 more boxes. Top, I don't want to do this anymore. I wasted 100,000 Baht of seaweed. I don't want to waste any more money. Because you've wasted 100,000 Baht you can't give up now. Please don't make me waste anymore. Waste even more uncle. A lot more even. I believe you can earn it all back. Hello. Hello, are you here yet? Where? Hey it's registration day! Wait for me Lin. You forgot everything already, huh. Uncle. Let's fry more seaweeds. It's all or nothing. Uncle! How are you doing? I'm okay. I should be able to go home in a few days. So you can eat anything now, right? Yeah. I already ate the congee that the nurse gave me. So you want me to taste your seaweed, right? That's right uncle. It's my karma. Please have a taste. It's that delicious? No. My tongue can't feel it yet. What about now? How did you do it? - Any discount? - Sorry, no. It's very difficult for the divers to get the seaweeds. Had too fight off sharks and giant octopus too. You are very funny. Witty Salesman. Sales is fun when you sell. - One of this. - Okay. Just a moment please. 2 bags. Thank you. It's guaranteed to be delicious. - I'm sure you'll be back for more. - This is your son? No, he's my nephew. Just 1 for me. OK. Moment please. I'll get you your change. - No bag please. - No bags, help reduce global warming. Doable. Mom Hello? Top, how are you? Okay mom. How's school? There's no class today. I can talk. I just want to call to wish you a happy birthday. Right, it's my birthday. You are that forgetful now? Happy Birthday again. Pay attention to your studies. You win some, you lose some. The most important thing is don't forget to take care of yourself. Thank you mom. Wait. Your dad wants to talk to you. Hello? Hello dad. Top listen to me. You study hard this semester. Next semester you can transfer here. I've already checked out a university for you. And the plane tickets, I will send you. Dad, tell me the truth about the debt? Be straight with me. How much? Have you ever felt that you're just a speck in the universe? Foreclosed. Property of Bank If you think you will be rich, then you will be rich. If you think you will succeed, you will be successful. By thinking this way you don't limit yourself. This is even more powerful than thinking out of the box. Being that everybody has different dimensions for their box.

If I told you I quit school, what would you do? I know you want to help your parents and you can by graduating. Because you don't think I can do it. That's why you want me to return to school. I just don't want you to struggle and risk everything. If you really believed in me you wouldn't talk that way. If it's about money, I can ask my parents for help. I'm not that bad yet. - I don't need any help. - I didn't mean it like that Top. - Top! I didn't mean that way. - I can take care of myself. I can do it, you hear me? Top please come back talk to me.

I am sorry. But all that you've done. I think is really amazing. You're still young. Go get your degree. Are you ready? All done. - Count it first. - OK. It's bent a little. - Nice basement. - I see. - Amulet must not be bent or crooked. - Okay. The background's pattern maybe betel nuts. The holy powders will be mixed. Hey kid, long time no see. You got new amulet? No sir, I want to buy my amulet back. Which one? That one. Hey this one is now worth 3-4 million Baht. You have that kind of money? I pawned it to you for only 100,000 Baht how come you don't sell me back to same price? This is a Somdej amulet, it's worth millions of Baht. Give me my dad's amulet back! Watch it. It's on my neck so it's mine. I said it's my dad's! You smart ass, you want to die? Get out of my face. Go! You're stupid enough to sell me for 100,000. I didn't cheat you. Get out! Asshole! Foreclosed. Repossessed by Bank Here is our factory. I almost forgot that we have this building. I remembered it when that banker mentioned it. Including the labor cost then it's around 1 million Baht. So I will pay a deposit first. Usually we need 50% upfront then we start working. But if you don't pay me in full, I will put you in jail, OK? Hey Toi Uncle, if we fail again what will we do? Don't worry too much Top. Nobody ever knows.
