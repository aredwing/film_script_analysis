Nortronix inteltronists would do anything to get the contract. Good. I'd feel uncomfortable travelling with him being... alive. He's just like me and you in every way. Well, almost every way. Besides you'll have to get used to him eventually. - Good luck! - Thank you. On the basis of a short story by STANISAW LEM PILOT PIRX TESTED Starring... With... Screenplay and dialogue based on a short story entitled "Rozprawa" Music Scenery Executive producers Photography Director So, The initial elimination left us with two candidates Commander Kent, whom we saw yesterday, and Commander Pirx. Both are exquisite pilots And both theoretically, at least for the time being, are available to us. Talking about Pirx... We know him as a man of total honesty. Let me remind you of the Vega rescue operation... ...during which he discovered a sequence of errors in one of the lines. Well gentlemen, as a human being he has got some weaknesses. But, returning to Kent... he is a really strong man... ...and trusted by United Atomic Laboratories Yes, and that's why we're supporting Kent as the candidate. His positive report would be enough for the UN Commission and UNESCO And then we can go ahead with the mass production which is the main purpose of our experiment. The involvement of someone like Pirx in our programme... It's sort of... risky... ...a gamble Personally, as the representative of Cybertronics, I think that... ...a pilot with such a reputation for honesty, like Pirx,... ...it doesn't matter if he'll do it consciously or not If he's going to be on our side, we'll have the best argument for the media and the public. And what if Pirx's report is negative? We all know, and we can speak openly... ...that some of our products have got faults. It could end in a disaster... ... of unimaginable magnitude. Because we have some disagreement I suggest that we take a vote Who would like to see Commander Pirx involved in our programme? On behalf of United Atomic Laboratories, I strongly disagree The result was positive Now it's up to you, Director... ...to have Commander Pirx agree to his involvement in our... ...I can say it without hesitation... it is OUR programme. That was slower than when we were on the moon. But at least we didn't have the spacesuits on. Let's hurry - the weather's changing. Apparently sometimes on mountaintops, even at noon, you can see the stars. We'll see for ourselves tomorrow. The way you're talking, you'd have thought you'd never seen them before. We'll be able to watch them from the earth for the whole month. They look better from the earth. Commander, an urgent message for you. I must return immediately. But you're on vacation. It's an order That's a pity - we could have had a nice month. - Here we are. - Thank you. - Commander Pirx? - Yes, that's me We've been waiting for you. Please take a seat. I'm busy now, and not available to anyone. Commander... I have an original proposition - even an experiment. What I'm about to say must be held in the strictest confidence... ...even if you refuse Do you agree? Not unless you tell me more. I understand, you aren't the kind of man to walk into something blind. I would have expected that, based on what I've already heard about you.. ...but that's even better. I'm talking about an experimental flight A new type of spaceship? No, a new type of crew. A crew? But I don't understand what my role will be. A thorough assessment of its usefullness That's all I can tell you at the moment. It's your decision. I can't accept this offer But why? Because of my own conscience. I cannot assess someone without knowing the rules of the game. Well then. Time for lunch... ...and then I'll take you to our centre where you can find out more. As you can see, I'll agree to anything. Good. I wonder what you've come up with. We're interested in introducing... ...a new automatic satellite... ... into Saturn's orbit. It's not an ordinary mission. Recently, the USSR and USA... ...have begun production of humanoid apparatus... so-called 'non-linears'. They are used mainly to operate extra-terrestrial space flights. Indeed, I've heard about it. That's even better, so what's your opinion? It's complete nonsense. The Pilots Association will never allow it. They will... Exactly. The companies who produce 'non-linears'... ...have to consider the objections of the Pilots Association, the Unions and the media. That's why they've handed over a few prototypes... ...to test their usefullness for extra-terrestrial flight. Handed over to whom, exactly? The United Nations? Us. Meaning, UNESCO. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. What do these robots have to do with culture or education? This so-called invasion of robots, produced on a mass scale... will have a big influence on worlwide human culture. Well, listen to a representative of an electronic company speaking at the last secret General Assembly which aided the decision to go ahead with our programme. "Let's not be afraid of purely economical consequences... ...the danger of unemployment, ... ...or even psychological, cultural or social impact. Losses which, apparently, could be caused by 'non-linears'. The most important thing is... ...that on extra-terrestrial flights use of 'non-linears'... is far safer than the use of human crew. Their reactions are much faster than of a human. They have almost no need for sleep, and they do not tire. They do not fall ill. Even when substantially damaged they still function. Further, they do not require oxygen or food. They can even carry out their duties... ...on board decompressed and over-heated spaceships. You should understand that we are not motivated by profit... ...but the safety od space travel. Not only privately-owned airlines... ...but those of socialist countries and members of the UN... ...should vote to support our decision. Enough for now. If those robots are really that good... ...sooner or later, your firm will start using them as well. And what will change if UNESCO oversee technical control of those firm's production? Commander, it's not about technical control... ...rather the psychological aspect. I need to tell you the rest. We would like to offer you a flight with such a crew. You would be in command. During the flight, you'd be able to assess every aspect of the crew's abilities. - And that would be all I would have to do? - Yes. - OK, but I have on more question. - I'm listening. What will be the consequences of my assessment? It will be decisive. For whom? For us, of course - UNESCO. We will publish your assessment in the global media. If your findings are negative, that will put the employment of robots on hold. And if it's positive - what then? Well, we are not a government... ...so we cannot stop anyone from building machines. There have been some government's that tried to do so, and failed. The church couldn't do anything either... ...and you know how strongly it opposed. So, no one really likes this idea. And all they do is look around helplessly. Why is it so? Anyway, you still haven't explained - why me? We have considered many pilots. We realised that if there were any objections... ...bearing in mind your own reservations, you'll be best placed to present them. Of course you can refuse. But if we were to do the same... ...it would be like Pilate's gesture. Because, the easiest thing would be to wash our hands of this. But, at the end of the day, we are not helpless. And the least we can do is that experiment. So, please make up your mind and contact us in the next two days - OK? OK Hello? But it wasn't my fault. I was doing everything I could. Of course, I fully realise it. A negative assessment means our company's bankruptcy. Yes, we need to use any means necessary. I understand. It's Mitchell. We need to find Pirx now. We're above road number 73. We've located the subject. We're observing the subject continuously. It's good that you found him. You've proven yourself. The choice of method... I will leave to you. Green here. It's Pirx, I accept. In 24 hours he'll fully regain consciousness. He can be included with the humans in the crew. My job is finished. Well, to be left with him on my own... Nonsense. He's got the intelligence and education of a human being. He's got specific duties to perform. What if he goes out of control? Even the human brain and its abilities are not fully understood... ...he has an even bigger capacity. I wish you luck. Commander Pirx, please proceed to room 207. - Hello, my name is... - Yes I know. Please follow me. - Are they here? - Yes, they're waiting for you. - Have you seen them? - Yes. Just for a moment. What are they like? There's five of them. One spoke to me. Completely unlike any robot. Completely. If I met him on the street... ...I wouldn't even think... But when I looked up close, there was something strange in his eyes. Here we are. Good luck. - After you. - No, I'm not going in. My name is McGuirr. I had the pleasure of travelling with you, but I'm sure you don't remember me. No, I don't. Gentlemen, this is your Commander, Mr Pirx. And this is your crew, Commander. First pilot - John Calder. Neurology and cybernetics, Tom Nowak. Electronics, Jan Otis. Second pilot, Harry Brown. And nucleonoid engineer, Kurt Weber. And now, I'd like to talk with you. To avoid misunderstanding I'd like to clarify that some of them do have natural parents. And some don't. They all know where they come from,... ...but don't know about each other's origin. Of course, they will follow your orders. In professional and personal relationships they'll be honest and show initiative. They have been instructed... ...that when questioned about who they are... they answer 'I'm an ordinary human being' Yes, but I shouldn't be asking them such questions. No, but you will have to bear in mind that some members of your crew aren't always truthful. Don't you think that someone's trying to make a fool out of me? No, not at all. You were told that it will be a new type of crew, but not that it will be homogeneous. We wanted to avoid any possibility of prejudice... ...from your side. You've explained it to me very nicely. Nevertheless, I don't think you've been honest with me. I won't change my mind, though. I was expecting that. So, with your permission, I'll talk with... my...people. Go ahead, you can talk to them. Brown. Do you believe in God? It's not part of my duties. You haven't answered my question. I said that it's not part of my duties. As your Commander, it's up to me to decide what is - and isn't - part of your duties. Well, if it's an order I can say that I'm not interested in that. Please, think carefully about the question. Depending on your answer, I'll make a decision about your presence on the mission. Calder...You're a pilot. For how long? I completed my training. Otis. How many Roentgen's of radiation can you withstand per hour? About 400, I think. Same as an ordinary human. But I'd have to go into treatment afterwards. How about more than 400? I don't know. I don't think so. Where were you born? Up North, beyond the Polar circle. Everyone - except Brown - I consider members of my crew. Brown will answer my question tomorrow. That is all. Commander Pirx and McGuirr are requested in the Control Room. Thank you. And now the Programme Director will explain the details... ...of your crew's mission. You have no idea how glad I am... ...that you accepted befeore the deadline we had given you. Do you want to know why? Well, I think you have decided... ...because you realised how important this programme is. No. It wasn't only that. Somebody tried to stop me from taking part. I don't understand. Someone tried to kill me. - Impossible. - And yet it's true. They set a trap. Luckily, I escaped. If I'd been killed, the Police would think it was an accident. But who would do such a thing? Someone who is against my involvement. And that's why I accepted. I don't like others taking decisions from me. Now I'll introduce you to the technical side of the Yoyana project. Please. You've underestimated us, Commander. What does that mean? Our boys cannot be distinguished so easily. How do you know all this? Who are you? Do you think I'm the designer? I work in public relations. But are you competent enough to answer my questions? Of course. Do the members of my crew, who aren't human... ...behave like humans? - Yes. - They do? - Yes, they do. - What for? - For the illusion to be complete. For those who are around them. What about blood? I asked you if they have blood? They have something similar to blood. What do you mean? Only a specialist, after thorough testing, would realise the difference. And I wouldn't? No, you wouldn't. Unless you have... - an x-ray device? You guessed, but you won't have one... ...on board. There are devices that can detect defects. You can get any amount of isotopes from the reactor. From an atomic pile, you can derive as many isotopes as you want. Commander, you're trying to make our job as difficult as possible. Of course! To make mine easier. You need to realise that it's not just to trick you... that we started a multi-billion dollar production. It was us who put the brains in the heads. If I'm not mistaken, it was nature. OK then, we were second. But the details are secret. And is everything else a secret? What do you mean? Are they capable of lying? Can they lose control? Yes, anything's possible. But less likely to happen than if humans were in the same situation. How can you be so certain? How amusing! We've performed experiments. And the humans were laboratory rats? Of course. - Even if they could result in death?! - Exactly. Interesting. And the results? Humans are less reliable. Poor, poor humans. And what would happen if... ...I tried to bash their heads in? He would defend himself. - Until I'm dead! - No, he would limit himself to defense. And what if attack is the only means of defence? Then he will attack you. Give me the contract. I agree. Here you are. Good luck. You can tell your superiors I will try to squeeze the worst out of them. Commander? You're a brave man, But, for your own sake... ...I advise caution. So I won't be finished off by the robots? Not robots - it's the humans who will fail first. Your plain old Joes. Do you understand? And robots? What do you really want from them? They're specialists. They'll do anything for you. I'll get them to do even more. One whisky, please. Whisky? Here you are. Tonic water, please. - Telephone for you. - Thank you. Hello? Pirx here. Well? Have you decided? I haven't had much time. All I can say is, all things considered... 've come to the conclusion that there is a 90% chance... ...or even 99%, that God doesn't exist. So there is a 1% chance that he exists. That God exists? Good. You can come on board with the others. - See you soon. - Goodbye. - What do you drink? - Gin and tonic. - It's time to say goodbye. - Goodbye, Director. - Ah, one more thing ... I need to let you know in advance, that all your commands will be registered. A black box? Yes. It will survive in the event of a crash. Then we could use it, instead of testimonies. The countdown has started. I should go. I wish you the best of luck. We've done all we had to. The rest is up to Pirx. There's one thing that bothers me. Pirx decided to fly because he miraculously avoided being killed. Do you think our part of the crew could rebel? That's nonsense. I don't know... I don't know. If it came to that, God help Pirx and the human crew. Get ready for docking procedure. Start the engines. Yes Sir, starting engines. Plasma: 814. Ionisation: 523. Reaction starting. Full ahead. Full ahead in 30 seconds. Novak, turn on the take-off shield. Turning the shield on. Full ahead in 10 seconds. Please, turn on the auto-pilot. After the briefing you will keep watch. You'll be relieved by Brown... ...then by me, Novak, Otis and Weber. Please, move on to your duties. In half an hour in the control room... I'll reveal all the details concerning the flight. Goliath has two automatic probes on board. Our goal is to send a probe into Cassini's crevice. It's not that easy. The crevice is very narrow. Yes, theoretically it is about 3,500 km wide, and the sides... ...are covered with a thick layer of icy stardust... ...which would scorch every ship that comes near. The passage way is about 500 km wide. Passing between the rings is practically impossible. We will send there only the first probe, which can be manoeuvred from a distance... ...since it has its own ionic propulsion. The first probe will be controlled by the second one. As you can see, our task is fairly simple. As long as we don't have any unpleasant surprises from the ship... ...or the crew. Show me the possible causes of the mission's failure. Pilot's error, touching the sides of Cassini's crevice. What's the possibility of taking the ship out of the crevice, without touching the sides? Instant deceleration and escape into space along the hyperbolic trajectory Stop! Danger! Manoeuvre impossible with humans on board, who would die from G-force. Show me the situation... ...which would force the pilot to enter Cassini's crevice. Can I speak with you? Please, come in. I'd like to tell you something. But... ...this conversation cannot leave this room. Agreed. I promise that it will remain a secret. I'm listening. I am... human. I'm telling you this because I want to help you. Because it all comes down to basic human solidarity. I cannot be silent when it concerns human well-being. You'd do the same, wouldn't you? We were kept separately all the time. We were allowed to contact no sooner than three days before the take-off. That's why I don't really know who is human and who isn't. But I suspect... - One moment. So why, when asked about whether you believe in God, you answered you had never thought about it... ...and that it's not part of your duties. I wanted to stay on the mission. Any direct answer would be risky, McGuirr was in the room. So do you believe in God? Yes. And you think that a robot cannot? Maybe you think that robots can have children? Okey, let's leave it and return to your suspicions. Yes... I think that... technician Otis is not human. These are of course little things hard to catch. When he sits or stands, he doesn't move at all, ... ... and you know very well that it's impossible to remain in the same position for too long. Sometimes, when he realizes that, he makes a few moves then freezes again. Yeah. Anything else? - He'll eat anything. - Anything? Whatever is served. He doesn't care one bit. After all, we all have our preferences. - Why haven't you kept your word? - Meaning? You swore to remain silent about your origin. I am to receive a reasonable sum of money for this mission. I did promise, but I also think that there are situations... ...when not keppeing a promise is one's duty. And you think that this is such a situation? Of course! What's more... ...any decent human being would do the same. You're the first. But we barely took off. I would like to help you during the mission. Why? It will be hard for you to find out who is who. And what's your personal interest in this denunciation? Don't leave! Listen to me carefully. Let's assume that thanks to you I know that there is another human on board. So what? You think I would treat him differently? That I would praise the ones who were human, not the ones who were competent? It seems you don't believe me? You think that... - ...you think that I could be... - I believe you... ...but if you've already said what you shouldn't have,.... ...it's not worth playing cat and mouse. I thank you for your sincerity... is there anything else? - I'm back. - Alright. - You can put you clothes on, everything's fine. Thank you. I would like to ask you something. Yes? Could you, by conducting some tests... ...determine who among the crew... No, this could only be determined surgically. Sir,... ... I would like to confess something. I'm not human. Sorry? I'm not human, but during the experiment I'll be on your side. Why?? It's quite simple, my motives are purely egoistic. If you praise us - nonlinears - in your report... ...we will be mass-produced and we will dominate all trades, not only space travel. But as long there are only a few of us... ...our perspectives are no different than those of normal humans. The only difference being that we are more talented. Well, it is logical, but aren't you afraid that the company may destroy you... ...if you don't get my praise. No, I'm not afraid of that, I'm very valuable. More valuable than a supersonic bomber. That's why a negative opinion is not a danger to me. So, could you reveal who among the crew... No... I mean I'm not sure. ...and apart from that... - What else do you want to know? - Tell me more about yourself. Okay, I have nothing to hide. Have you ever experienced a reaction like... ...bewilderment, fear, disgust when... ...someone would find out that you're not human. Yes, once. When I assisted during an operation. A nurse didn't know who I was. Nurse, scalpel. Noooo! Noooo! Yeah... and what did you feel then. I don't feel much at all. I was a little uneasy. I got an impression that it's much easier to work with men. Please tell me... what is your attitude toward your creators? That is... to humans. I'm glad I'm alive. My creators weren't able to predict lots of things. I am grateful because, after all... ... it's better to be a machine than not to exist at all. Do you remember the moment of your birth? I didn't go through all the development stages, and there is no trace of a child in me. What do you mean? It means that the world of cities, streets, family life... ...is your only reality. For me it's laughable. I see nothing laughable about this. And what do you think of God? I was created by science and science rejects everything that is absolute. Nonrelative time, space, immortal soul... Quite a few things you need to regard as absolute. What else fo you find so conventional? Ethics, friendship, love...? What do they mean to you? They all mean nothing to me! However, I benefit from them. I have other ethics. In fact, quite similar to yours. For the time being I need it. For the time being? Technical progress ravages your morality. Who knows how long you'll keep with your ethics. Excuse me. Why do they eat? Only to prove that they are human? But it's laughable! It's even more conventional than the things Novak mentioned. Yep, but the only laughable person at the moment is me. They eat, talk. Everything seams natural, common. Everyone of them is human yet a robot at the same time. Maybe they all simply want to fool me. Maybe Novak is just a plain physician... ... and Brown only pretends to be human. Is there any way out of it? How to find out the truth? Maybe I could provoke some dangerous situation,... ...which would force them to act and divide into two groups. And if I break my neck and kill all the humans on board... ...and the ship is brought back by the robots who can survive anything. It would make for a great PR for their manufacturers. Who is it? It's just me, Weber. - Have you checked the probes? - Yes, Sir. Do you want to tell me something? - No. - Wait a second. What's going on? Go on. - I'm afraid... - Go ahead. I would like you to consider me your ally. Although I must warn you, that I won't reveal what I am. I must keep my word. Alright. So you want to tell me something about the rest of the crew. Yes. Brown isn't human. Do you have any proof? During the preparations for the flight, I was examining the reactor... ...and I got an idea. I took a sample from the hot interior of the reactor... ...and I placed them between two lead bricks in the control room hallway. Everyone had to cross a weak beam of radiation. When Brown was about to pass, he suddenly stopped and let me go first. in order to have a look at the shelf. Nobody else reacted. It would mean that Brown has an additional radioactive sense. This could have been a simple concidence. Have you noticed anything else? Nothing for now. I'll let you know if I do. Of course, only if you wish so. Very well, thank you. Show me the approach area according to the Stanlem's space pilotage. - Calder, it's Pirx. - Sir? Come to my quarters, please. Right away, Sir! - I'm listening. - Come on, don't be shy. I suppose it's your turn. I'm afraid I don't understand, Sir. Don't have anything to say to me? Have a drink with me then. After all, off-duty we can tolerate our human weaknesses. - I don't think... - Come on, you have my permission. Cheers, Calder. Cheers. Tomorrow we're passing through extremely dusty regions. I would like to revise the pilotage if you don't mind. I won't keep you. I'd like to thank you for the whisky. It was very good, Sir. Everything is calm, sir. Attention Commander! I am one of the members of the crew who are not human. I was watching you all the time... ... while you were trying to identify me. At the beginning we had the same goal. Your unfavourable opinion would satisfy me,... ...because mass production would take away my exceptionality... ...or would even mean my termination. I wasn't plotting anything, but... ...your strange edginess and anxiety showed me... ...that you lost the first bout, Commander. And only then I noticed that the role of human servant... ...cannot satisfy me. Your world is horribly empty for me,... ...your ideals laughable and your democracy... ...is just a reign of schemers chosen by fools. That's why I decided to take over... ...so that people would understand what they dared to do... ...by creating an artificial creature faithful to them. I will show you that there is no foolishness crazy enough... ...or an idea so ludicrous... ...that it couldn't be embraced by humans,... ...as long as it is nicely packaged. And you will never get out of the trap,... ...that you made for yourself. As you can see, I am completely frank with you. And I will win the second bout, because I can't see any weak spots... ...I would have that could allow you to win. That would be all. Maybe some time in the future I could show you you can count on me... ...but now I count on you in a way. Good bye, Commander. I just must be a case of paranoia. You offer me protection when you are the ruler of the world... ...megalomania. So what is there left for me? Fighting you would be pointless, you are stronger than me. Intellectual confrontation is no good either. What can work to my advantage? Emotions? Humanity that you seem to lack? For you humanity is the sum of our defects,... ...our weaknesses. Maybe I could change this battle of strengths into a battle of weaknesses. Try to find a situation in which human weakness is better than robot's perfection. Check... ...mate. Get ready for a return match after the manoeuvres. Where's Calder? I'm here, Sir. Please begin. First probe on the launch position. On position. What are the dust readings? ...and rising by the second. We have an asteroid cluster on course. Shoot! The area is clear. Launch the first probe! The probe reached its orbit, second launch pad ready. Launch the second probe! It's blocked! Use the hydraulic piston. It's not coming out! The ionic engine of the probe will start in 10 seconds. Calder, turn the probe's engine off! First pilot to Commander: We're going to enter the crevice. We can drop the probe by high acceleration. I won't allow it! The witness was the second pilot on Goliath. That's right Mr. Chairman. What orders did the commander give after the second probe failed. He didn't give any orders. In that case, please describe the situation on the ship... ...after the failure. When we managed to stabilize the ship,... ...Calder was supposed to begin the deceleration. Instead he started accelerating. I figured out he had changed the course. Instead of getting further away from the planet,... ...he chose to enter the Cassini's crevice with great acceleration in order to drop the probe, It was a dangerous manoeuvre,... ...almost suicidal. The commander didn't give him permission.. Objection, Your Honor! Pirx didn't give that order. But he wanted to! When Calder increased the acceleration... ...the commander wanted to shout,... ...but at 14g... ...it's impossible to speak a word. It looked like Calder wanted to keep him from giving that order. Objection, Your Honor. The witness tries to suggest that... ...Pilot Calder obstructed Pirx from giving the order on purpose. The witness shall keep his interpretations to himself... ...and tell us what the commander actually said. The commander wasn't able to formalize an order... ...but his intention was entirely clear. He forbade Calder to enter the Cassini's crevice. Please, repeat the words and the Court will decide by itself... ...what is their proper interpretation. I... can't remember precisely... ...I think he shouted: "Do not enter the crevice!" or "Do not go through the ring!". Something like that. He wasn't able to say anything more. So what really took place on board? What really happened is that the commander... ...forbade the first pilot to enter the crevice. The testimony of this witness is trying to manipulate the truth! The defence proposes another hearing of the tapes from the control room... ...the part containing the Commander's shout. The court declines. The tapes were already examined... ...and it was determined that it is only possible to recognize the person shouting,... ...and not the actual words. May the witness tell the Court what happened after the shout. Novak, I don't think there's going to be a rematch. Calder, you didn't execute my order! I forbade you to enter the crevice! I couldn't hear it, Sir. Do you want to cause a disaster? I'll go through Cassini and decelerate on the other side. Don't touch the fuse! Brown, full ahead! Full ahead! Brown, shoot! - Shoot! - Yes, Sir! May the witness explain why... ...didn't Pirx order Calder to turn back or decelerate... ...after Goliath had entered the crevice, and the acceleration had decreased. Especially if he saw any danger for the ship and crew. To decelerate from that speed... ...we would have had to switch to reverse. All humans would have died. Besides, the instructions say that if the commander keeps quiet... ...he permits the first pilot to act independently. High tribunal,... ...this testimony confirms the prosecution argument. Instead of settling for a particular decision... ...and passing it to the first pilot... Commander Pirx... is silent. The actions are very clear. Commander Pirx didn't keep the pilot from entering the Cassini's space,... ...and stayed silent, which lead to a disastrous situation. Didn't this criminal passiveness,... ...apart from destroying the nonlinear prototype,... put the whole crew and ship in danger? Defence calls the crew physician - Dr Tom Novak... ...to present a new piece of material evidence. May the witness explain what is... this crucial exhibit. After Calder's death,... ...as the crew physician, I conducted a thorough autopsy. I stumbled upon something that resembled a black box. It contained Calder's thoughts recorded in a verbal form... ...and traces of visual impulses. It can be played as a regular cassette. Prosecution objects! A violation of the secrecy of thought... is a crime... against basic human laws. Applying human rights... ...to a robot... ...seems to be a slight exaggeration. The tribunal accepts this evidence. Please, play the tape. Calder, you didn't execute my order! I forbid you to enter the crevice! I didn't hear it, sir? Do you want to destroy the ship? I'll go through Cassini and decelerate on the other side. I can't control the ship... Time for a decision... Give an order! They all lead to a disaster... Give an order! Danger! Delaying the order leads to a crash... My solution - possible... What to do? Escape into open space... How?! Blow the g-fuse!... Humans will die and I will bring the ship home by myself. Solution found! Don't touch the fuse! Brown, full ahead! I exposed myself! They want to destroy me. The g-force increases! 10g, 12g! What to do? 14g - I can't hold out! ????????????????????? Befeore the tribunal passes sentence,... ...let us hear Commander Pirx. High tribunal,... ...until we have seen the cassette, my testimony sounded ridiculous. Now it's all clear. The temperature of the hatch was equal to the temperature of vacuum. Water released by Calder has frozen and blocked the bow of the probe. It was irreversibly stuck after it was hit with the hydraulic piston. When the ionic engine started it melted the ice off leaving no trace of the sabotage. Calder had it all figured. Probe's failure,... the rotation... entry into the crevice and the death of the crew. He wanted to turn Goliath into a death ship. He took everything into account. Except one thing. Humans can be helpless and lost,... ...humans can hesitate, have scruples... ...but a robot cannot. To be honest, I didn't know what to do. My every order could have led to a crash... ... and Calder could have questioned it. All that, recorded on a tape, was to become a proof of his loyalty. Evidence that he wanted to save us until the very end. And I didn't say a word. And it was my silence, Calder recognised as canniness,... ...and my helplessness in the situation as as shrewdness. Then he started to react like a human... ...and lost. I was accused of being passive in a critical situation. No,... ...I am guilty of a different misbehaviour. Though it's not included in the Space Code... He's here! A couple of words for the press. How did you feel as the accused? Hey, Commander. It seems like you're undecided again. I'm grateful to Novak. If he didn't find that black box inside Calder's body... ...I would have to spend the rest of my life behind the desk. Excuse me. Let me pass, please. - Novak. - Sir. Tell me please, why did you tell me you were a robot? You see, I'm a neurologist and... ...I know robots psyche pretty well. I was supposed to help you find their soft spots. I sounded more plausible in the mouth of a robot-traitor. It's true. And to be honest I believed you then. And you really helped me. Thank you. After violent demonstrations around the world, the UN General Assembly... ...banned so called "nonlinears" from production. We were saved and he was doomed by my hesitation. My kind-heartedness. Human kindness which he kept in so much disdain. It saved us and ruined him. Okay, let's move. I hope this time we will be able to check if it's true what they say... ...that you can see stars from the peak at noon. I'm sure we will. You seem changed. What's happening? What are you thinking of? I was thinking... no, nothing. One thing I can't get out of my mind... ...is the scar on Novak's hand. Do you think there are more of them among us? Let's go.
