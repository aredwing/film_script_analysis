See you later! - Good morning! - Morning, Engineer! Morning. The engineer is honest. He looks you straight in the eye. Nothing to hide. He's better than some. "A Road for Aguas Altas" website paradise past present future people Osvaldo, a coffee! Concha's coming! Concha? The Spanish woman? "A Road for Aguas Altas" Government's decision imminent!!! people Thanks, Osvaldo. Concha! - When she arrives, I'll propose. - You barely know her! Exactly. Concha doesn't know me well enough to say no. And you and Ana? When are you getting married? Ana knows me too well to say yes. Loading This is Victor Silva, forest ranger and Aguas Altas' most eligible bachelor. And the only one. I'm tired of being rejected. This isn't for the site, is it? Before the dam, the village was bigger! From this valley up to the tower. The bridge was below us. The school, over there. Lost waters. Aguas Altas? I was born here. I'll die here. It's not a bad place to live. Good people. Good neighbors. Though some are... I won't say more. - Bless me, Father Felicidade. - God bless you. Good morning, Pedro. Aguas Altas is a place worth seeing. Too bad no one ever comes. - It needs a website. - A what? A waste of time and money. Aguas Altas isn't even on the map! The devil couldn't find us. We don't need a... ... website. We need a new village. For Aguas Altas, the road is a new beginning. A new road, new partnerships, new opportunities. Change! Big changes! Next year, we'll be driving on the new road. On MY road. Then you'll go back to Lisbon. We'll never see you again. Stop that! Pedro Afonso. He came here to build a road to link us to the world. Damn! Countdown to the decision SUNDAY The Lord's Day - May God be with you. - He is with us. God bless us. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. - May the peace of the Lord be with you. - Thanks be to God. Though the Lord did not grant us the road, we respect His wisdom and ask for His mercy. Miraculous Queen Queen of heaven Didn't I tell you? Miguel, where are you going? You did your best, Osvaldo... We'll get it next time. Forget it. It's not your fault. It's all Osvaldo's fault. - A real Mayor would have got the road. - Why is it his fault? It's not your fault. It's not mine. So it's his! MONDAY The World isn't like that Public Works Ministry Road Planning Pedro... What's better, 'Road Planning Assistant' or 'Regional Transport Aide'? LEAVE ON HOOK! What's that? Fernando! What's that for? With no road, I'll need a new job. We'll get the road. A road, a bridge, a tunnel... Even if it takes me the rest of my life. A letter for you, Engineer. Registered mail. The keys to the Jeep! Can you hear me? No... Alberto? From a law firm? Lisbon/Madrid? Who's going to sign now?. For the village site. - I don't have all day, Jose. - Morning, Engineer! I'm on my way. Hello, Engineer! Why's he in such a hurry? Aguas Altas, Spring Water By next year, Aguas Altas will be n 1 in Spain and Portugal. It's a fabulous campaign. - Modest as ever. - Modesty gets you nowhere. Elena, next year your division won't exist. They'll announce it at the next Board Meeting. So I have to act fast. - If the campaign is a success... - A huge success. An enormous success! We'll see if they still close the division. I want us to try again. - Vicente, it doesn't work between us. - We need more time together. That's the problem. Neither of us has time. - Carmen. - Shall I call Aguas Altas? I'll call. You've reached Ana Alves. I'm not here. Leave a message. Ana, my love. Call me. I need to talk to you. It's urgent. Kisses. Luisa! Luisa! I'm taking down the wash. Pedro received a letter. Registered mail. Joaquim said he turned white then drove off in the Jeep. Don't you understand? - Ana left him. - She left him. I understood. But you don't send a letter for that. - Then someone died. - Who could it be? That's it! An inheritance! Joaquim said the letter came from a law firm. Why not start with that? If it's an inheritance, ask for a raise. "Having registered the site" "in the name of the Aguas Altas Village Association," " Engineer Pedro Afonso..." Engineer? "... is ordered to stop using the internationally registered trademark, Aguas Altas." "Failure to do so will result in our asking the court" "for 500.000 Euros in damages." They don't fool around. What can I do? We agreed not to send a letter. - DRINAM doesn't give in to squatters. - Aguas Altas is the name of their village! Aguas Altas is a trademark registered in our name. Don't worry. It will be ours. Will they give it up so easily? If your letter didn't complicate things... A liqueur. The poor engineer. It's hard to lose someone. If someone has to die, better there's an inheritance. It's not an inheritance. - When the Engineer left, he was upset. - Another brandy, Osvaldo. He's in trouble. Maybe he killed someone... If he killed someone, they'd send the police, not a letter. I'm telling you! It's an inheritance! And Luisa will get a raise. One more, Osvaldo. He has an illegitimate child. An illegitimate child? Pedro?! I don't believe it. He never fooled me with his roaming eyes. He was always polite to me. It all fits! Luisa said Ana ran out of the house upset. I don't believe any of it. That's your weakness, Maria. You see good everywhere. - Is that wrong? - The world isn't like that! I've decided. I'll close the site. You can't. You opened it in the name of the Village Association, only they can close it. - The village doesn't care about the site. - Good! Call a General Assembly. When no one comes, vote alone. your problems are over. - Exciting news, isn't it? - Something I don't know?. The Engineer Pedro is rich. Jose heard him on the phone. He sold the village site for 500.000 Euros! The Engineer sold our site? For 500.000 Euros? I knew Pedro didn't have an illegitimate child. You've reached Ana Alves. I'm not here. Leave your message. My love, why don't you call? I'm in such trouble! You can't even imagine it. I really miss you. Kisses. Relax. Shout naked from the tower, still no one would come! General Assembly Aguas Altas Association Tuesday 8:30pm Did you hear that? Let's go. TUESDAY Open or Closed? Aguas Altas Site to Close A coffee, please, Osvaldo. Association meets tonight to decide the future of site Wedding soon Concha Arrives Today Here's your coffee, Engineer. "INTERNET CONNECTION " What are you doing? Attention all passengers! Train from Spain arriving Platform 1... Victor Silva speaking. Either I'm asleep or working in the forest. Leave a message. - How are you? - How do I seem? Sit down. Let's begin. Silence! If I hadn't come by, you'd have spent all night here. So I should thank you? You forgot your flowers. Who are you to sell our site? I'm not selling it. A Spanish company, Drinam, is suing us for 500.000 Euros if we don't close the site. Do you want to pay? Brothers. We're in the Lord's house. Don't you see? This will put us on the map. Aguas Altas, High Tech Capital! Who are the Spanish to close our site? Where's our pride? What's pride got to do with this? Look for problems, you'll find them. Lawyers mean big problems! Calm down! Why a Spaniard? No pretty women here? Did you ever live in a village? I've always lived in Madrid. As a kid, I was fat. Really fat. They called me Fat Victor. How can I marry a girl who called me Fat Victor? Fat Victor... I like that... - Enough talk! Open or closed? - Open! - You're forgetting the lawsuit! - Clara's right! I'm not paying a cent. I need a new roof. I'm fine. I'm fine. Quiet, please! My friends, let's look at it another way. If Drinam can sue us... for 500.000 Euros... ... that means the site is worth 500.000 Euros. If Drinam wants the site... ... they have to pay! Don't worry, Elena. With my vote and Pedro's, the site is yours, 2-0. Ignacio. Closed. - Open! - Make up your mind! Open or closed? If I have to choose... Keep it open... ... for now. Aguas Altas! We can change to aguasaltas.pt. PT for Portugal. Our village is bigger than Portugal! Silence! Luisa. Open or closed? We both want to close it. Luisa, one person, one vote. I want to close it. Mario does too. Mario, do you agree! Open! Damn it! The Spanish invaded in 1580, remember? Now they're back and starting with our site! It's the Engineer's turn. He can't vote. He's not from the village. I can't vote? For over a year, I worked to get you a road... ... now I can't vote? - No. Can he vote, Father? All residents over 18 have the right to vote. Over here. What is it, Engineer? Open or closed? Better to close it. Can I still vote? Yes. Open or closed? Open. As Mayor and president of the Village Association, I certify with 25 for, the decision to keep the site open. Pedro! - You'll like it here, Concha. - Concha?! Pedro! - 25-14. It could have been worse. - It's a disaster. I need the site back! People will change their votes when they understand. We're very sensible. Who would have guessed? Am I still Concha? The village would kill us if they knew the truth. - Can I take a shower? - Yes. Wake me if the Spanish invade. Luisa?! You voted 'open' for me? - So they'll think you're on their side? - Affirmative. Now you'll convince them to close the site. I voted like them. They won't be suspicious. No one could make that up. Open up! Or I'll knock the door down! To Concha. Welcome to Aguas Altas. Victor. This time you caught a shooting star. Did I say something wrong, Concha? I'm not Concha. I'm Elena Aledo. From Drinam. I'm here to get the site back. Out! Get out! Thanks for having us. It was for you and Concha. Not for Elena. For the village, Elena is Concha. Now what? What must the village think of the three of us here together... WEDNESDAY Brother against Brother Brothers. To live in harmony with our fellow Christians... To reach out to others... To share our joys... Our sorrows... Our Lord taught us, love your neighbor as yourself. That's the most important commandment. Some of you... ... may disagree. But the site can become a symbol of our faith. If Jesus were alive, He'd have His own website. If Jesus were alive, He wouldn't want the site. It will hurt our village. Where some see problems, others see God's will. Didn't Jesus change water into wine? But not to sell it. Nor to drink it Himself. May God guide us in His infinite wisdom. Only He can show us the way. - Good morning. - That robe's mine. - Morning, Fat Victor. - Morning! With my vote and my aunt's, we need four more votes. If we convince the priest, he'll convince the others. - Good luck with Father Felicidade. - Oh thee of little faith. I'm seeing Father today. - I'll go with you. - 1 1 :30 at the church. O.K.? Be nice to my fiance. It won't work. Victor thinks it will. He also thought Concha would be on the train. You're not helping us? Aren't you from Drinam? Ask your lawyers for help. Let's go to Chico's for a drink. Chico's?! That's the other side of the world! Even dead I wouldn't set foot in Osvaldo's. - Osvaldo voted like us. - But for the wrong reasons. He should have stayed in Brazil. Hop on. Fernando said I can increase business if I go online. All your clients live nearby. - Why would they shop online? - What do you know about Internet? Enough not to sell the site. Concha seems nice. She even speaks Portuguese. I hope she's not too much for Victor. My Victor's man enough for any woman. It's strange... The three of them sleeping under the same roof... For 50 years, I've put up with your gossip. I've had enough. Let them enjoy life! Take this. And this. And this and this. Keep it all! Everything's overpriced. Where is it cheaper? On Internet! - Fernando thinks this is America. - We have to help Elena. I'm not helping Elena! My decision's final! "Last night, a small Portuguese village" "declared war on a large multinational" "to save its website." "Aguas Altas vows to fight to death and beyond." This is too much... I lost the road. Ana left me. Now I'll spend years fighting something that's not my fault. Wait! Ana left you? I'm not the only one with women problems. How did the paper find out? "AGUAS ALTAS AT WAR FOR ITS WEBSITE" "By our special correspondent, Fernando Oliveira." Are you crazy? I'm just the messenger of progress! Where do I start? Go with Elena to see Father, I'll talk to the forest crew. Fine. Thanks, Pedro. You're a great guy. - Come in. - May we, Father? Come in, Victor. Hello, Concha. Marriage is a sacred sacrament. Two people are joined together before God for all eternity. Do you... Does Victor take... this vow of matrimony... ... seriously? Yes, Father. I'm sure he'd say yes... ... if he were here. May God forgive me! I want to help Victor, but I can't do this. Father, wouldn't it be best to close the site? For the spiritual good of the village... Almighty God sent us this site. Only He... ... can close it. If Victor wants to marry, he has to see me in person! - Now Father's against us. - It's not my fault. - Victor and I will deal with this. - I'm the only one who can do it. - You haven't gotten far. - Can you do better? - It's not hard. - We'll see. I'm not surprised Ana left you. - Osvaldo. - What? We have to close the site. Drinam will never pay 500.000 Euros! Of course not. "Aguas Altas at war over its website." Now, the site is worth 800.000 Euros. Even a million! My basket is full. What do I do now?. It's worse than I thought. Much worse. It's never too late to learn. With less than a month to the elections, polls show the two parties tied. The Prime Minister will be in our studio live. Don't miss it. Here. On your TV. You've reached Ana Alves. I'm not here. Leave your message. Elena! - Did you convince Father? - To marry us? No. Goodbye. I couldn't go. It would be lying before God. The forest crew said no. They want the money. Will 100.000 Euros get the site back? Taken from my ad budget. - You want to bribe the village? - I don't see another way. - Luisa! - I'm over here! Pedro wants you to be the first to know. Drinam is paying 100.000 Euros to close the site. My aunt and I agree. If Mario says yes, we only need three more votes. - 100.000 Euros? - 2.500 per person. Finish this. - I'll deal with Mario. - Luisa, what do I do? Twist and wrap. Twist and wrap. Then you're done. Concha will help you. - You'll see how lovely our feast is. - Thanks. What do I do? Twist and wrap. Twist and wrap. Then you're done. Drinam is paying 2.500 Euros per person. Add it up. - 5.000 Euros for the two of us. - Betray my country for money? Never! We need a new roof! Soon, it'll be raining inside. Where are you going, Mario? To get my pajamas. I'm moving to my mother's. Your mother's? Come back. What will people say? "Here..." "in Aguas Altas..." "... everyone is fine". Osvaldo! Help me. Let me do it. Take the mouse. It changes. You press. Tiny but tough... What a joke! At Chico's, everyone was laughing at us. He who laughs last, laughs best. "Here in Aguas Altas everyone is fine." Joaquim, what do you think? Why send a letter? Email is as fast as can be. With the money from the site, we can lobby for the road. With my share, I'm buying a new freezer. The money's for the village. Not for you. It's for the villagers! And I'm one of them. Osvaldo. Is the money for the village or the villagers? We didn't decide that. The dignity of our village is priceless. The village! The village! I've had it with the village! If this keeps up, it will ruin our feast. Go on... What do you want to tell me? Concha called to apologize. The real one or the false one? Before, I dated anyone. It never worked. With Concha, I know why I love her. She puts sugar on a spoon then in her coffee. She does crossword puzzles in ink, not in pencil. You learned all that on a weekend in Spain? There must be millions of reasons you love Ana. - How are you? - Glad you could come. - My assistant, Rui Tadeu. - Pleased to meet you. - My pleasure. - Shall we sit? - Thank you for coming. - I should thank you. Why are you like this? - Because we're enemies. - You both want the same thing! You're wrong. Elena wants what she wants, I want what I want and God only knows what the village wants. Pedro! It's started. The Portuguese expect a quick, forceful response. Mr. Prime Minister, with only weeks to the elections, polls have your party tied with the opposition. - Are you worried? - Not at all. The Portuguese have confidence in us. - That's not what the opposition says. - They speak. We act. - The Portuguese know the difference. - I'm sorry to interrupt. A newsflash. A small village in Portugal, Aguas Altas... is being sued by the multinational Drinam for 500.000 Euros if they don't close their website. The 800-year-old village's name is the same as one of Drinam's registered trademarks, Aguas Altas mineral water, soon to be relaunched in the Iberian market. Mr. Prime Minister. What's your position on this threat to national sovereignty? We're working with the village to solve this problem. - This is a disaster. - A catastrophe. We're on TV! We're famous! We'll be back after a short break. Stay with us. We're off the air. - Stop this before it blows up. - I'll go to Aguas Altas myself. That was Ana. THURSDAY The whole world's talking about us - Thanks for the ride, Joaquim. - You're welcome. The way to Aguas Altas? - Good morning, Engineer. - Good Morning, Manuel! God bless you! Let me through. I'll answer all your questions. - Vicente. It's Elena. - What's wrong? Aguas Altas was on the news. It's chaos here. - I'll do what I can. - One at a time. But I don't know how it'll end. Do you have international support? Worldwide support for our cause has been overwhelming. It proves geography is not destiny. Engineer, our village will be famous. The site is ours! United we'll win. "SAVE OUR SITE" Do you like it? Worldwide support? A little imagination never hurt. "Night mail" speaking. Can I have Fernando Oliveira? - Elena. - Vicente? - Rita's going on Portuguese TV. - What?! Don't let her do that. You know her when her mind's made up. Do what you have to. I'll do what I can. Engineer Pedro Afonso? Him. Rui Tadeu. Assistant to the Prime Minister. - Hello... - We got a mail about Aguas Altas... We don't have an official position yet. I'm suspended...?! You should have told us about Drinam's letter. - Aguas Altas is in the middle of nowhere. - So were the Falklands. And Parsley Island? Spain and Morocco almost fought over it. I'm here to save the site. And ensure that Aguas Altas stays in the middle of nowhere. We're ready to fight... Get this junk out of here. And go with it. We're not leaving. We're coming to you live from Aguas Altas, a small village under siege by the national media. With us, Osvaldo Tavares, Mayor of the village. As Mayor of Aguas Altas, I can say we intend to protect our rights. The rights of Aguas Altas. I want to send a message to Drinam... You chose the wrong village to bully! Did you hear that? - Long live Aguas Altas! - Very good. We want 500.000 Euros minimum. Not a cent less. Ana. Concha. Concha. Ana. My fiance. It's an abuse of power! The world will see we're not stupid. Ana! - Hello, Concha! - Hello, aunt! Hello, aunt! How wonderful! The whole world's talking about us! Once the site is closed, I'll come back to Lisbon. You want to close the site?! Betray the village's dreams? - And our dreams, Ana? - This is bigger than us! I created the site, I'm closing it. No matter what you or the village think. - It's best for everyone. - You can't do that! I can... ... and I will. We won't give in to blackmail. The Board is with me. The legal precedents aren't clear. We've been off the market for years. And the village is over 800 years old. We have the means to win. It's a mistake. Mistake or not, the decision's mine. We're here in Aguas Altas to follow this dramatic situation. The village wants to hear Drinam's reaction to their position. With us, live from Madrid, Rita Diego, Executive VP of Drinam. - Can you hear me, Rita? - Yes. Clearly. Is Drinam suing Aguas Altas for trademark infringement? Drinam's policy is to defend its trademarks. Even against the wishes of a village with the same name? If the village gives up the site, we'll stop legal proceedings. And if the village refuses? They should prepare for a long, costly legal battle. - Aguas Altas is ours! - If they want the site, let them pay! As you can see, Aguas Altas is ready to fight. - What do you think? - Things will die down soon. We need to stay firm to discourage other site squatters. Vicente. We need to stay firm. But we're losing goodwill. Goodwill? Aguas Altas is the one acting in bad faith. - Is Elena still in the village? - We don't need her. I hope you're right. We're live again from Aguas Altas. Mario Figueira is with me. Forced to choose between his wife and his village, he didn't hesitate. - You're separated from your wife? - My country is worth more than a roof! Believe me. The site is just the start. Soon we'll all be speaking Spanish. Muy bien... Muy bien... Stay at your mother's, if you like it so much! Now it's me who wants a divorce. Thank you, Mario. I see the Engineer Pedro Afonso, creator of the site. Despite the village's wishes you want to close the site? You don't want to answer? I came to Aguas Altas to build a road to link it to the world. Instead, I created a site that's made the village internationally famous. What more can I ask for? And for now, that's all from Aguas Altas. Ignacio! - Pedro, how many can you take? - How'd you get here so fast? I caught a ride with Fernando. Osvaldo took three. Clara one. Fernando two. - Two what? - Journalists. How many can you take? Zero! Zip! Nada! None! And Victor? Victor's house doesn't even have walls. Right, Victor? We'll give them a discount. You're letting Concha leave? - You can't jump ship now. - It's better if I leave. - This is all my fault. - For Portugal, it's my fault. Ana called me a traitor live on TV. Is it straight? It's even. Like this? If this keeps up, Agua Altas will be the center of the world. That's it! You're a genius! The more famous Aguas Altas is the worse the situation will become... The worse the situation becomes, the more everyone... -... will need us. I knew I was a genius... Pull! Victor, pull there! - Is it straight? - Pull. We put it up, he takes it down? Pedro! Give me that. Thank you. We'll mail you the press kit. - Elena. - Rita! We want you in Madrid today. - No. I'm not coming today. - Then tomorrow. Tomorrow?. No. What? - I'm never coming again. - Elena? What's going on? What's up? I quit! FRIDAY The foreigners invade We're journalists. Let us through. Fernando Oliveira speaking. We're not against globalization. This is different. Sponsorships? Aguas Altas is a Portuguese site for the whole world. Thanks to you, my love, the whole world is watching Aguas Altas. I still want to close the site. - You're only pretending?! - I support the village. I'm only pretending I want to keep the site. I don't understand you. Maybe one day you will. Maybe. - Is everything fine with Ana? - Things are clear between us. Attention! Great news! We're going to be on a TV debate. Live from Aguas Altas! SATURDAY The World's most famous village We're going on the air. Take your seats. Camera on. Once again, we're in Aguas Altas to hear what its inhabitants have to say about the complex situation they're living. Keeping the site is essential for Portugal's survival. Sit down. I'll slap you. The site contributes to the village's... ... spiritual well-being. Some of you want to sell it to finance local development? The village needs improvement. Money is tight. Portugal isn't for sale! It's not about Portugal. It's about my village. OUR village. The most famous global village in Portugal! The most famous global village in the world! Aguas Altas! Mr. Mayor. A direct question. Would you sell the site? A Mayor carries out the wishes of the voters. What do you mean? If the village wants to sell the site, it has my support. Traitor! SUNDAY The highest bidder wins After yesterday's debate, Portuguese public opinion backs nationalization of the site if Aguas Altas decides to sell it. In Madrid, Drinam headquarters is under siege by hundreds of Aguas Altas' supporters chanting anti-Drinam slogans. From Aguas Altas for LGT, this was Ana Alves reporting. - You said this would die down? - It couldn't be better. Aguas Altas' name brand recognition has soared. No to globalization. Down with Drinam! OUT! Protesters are blocking Drinam. We're being boycotted. For you, that's good? I'm sure Elena can get the site back if we're ready to pay. Elena doesn't work for us anymore. - Can she do it discretely? - I don't see how... Give her whatever it takes to end this madness. Vicente. - Elena, good news! - Tell me. The Board's authorized you to get the site back at any price. We're in your hands. Kisses. Drinam's given in! Is 15.000 Euros... per person enough? - Concha, my vote is yours! - We're on the right road. I'll tell Osvaldo. I'm here for whatever you need. Morning. Engineer Pedro! Can we talk? We can't waste time. - Portugal has to keep the site. - That's your problem. Don't you want to return to Lisbon? Only when the road is finished. That's... blackmail. Call it what you like. I call it... ... revenge. Drinam's offered money. Lots of money. Keeping the site is vital for the government. Can you guarantee that? The highest bidder wins. Good afternoon. Portugal... ... would be grateful if you kept the site open. - Grateful? More or less how grateful? - A new road isn't enough? Here's... ... what we want. Repair of village roofs. Yes. - A helicopter for fire protection. - Upgrade our team to the 1st division! - A post office with internet access. - A rotunda for the village. - A new freezer for the store. - WIFI for the entire village. We need a decision by tomorrow morning. And Viagra! So, Pedro... What did the government promise? A helicopter, Viagra... and the road... That's all? Isn't it enough? I have 'carte blanche'. I raise the stakes. There! Up on top. There? A road comes down through the forest, a bridge runs over us... ... like a giant tree across the water. Over there, a tunnel... ... goes through the mountain to the other side of the world. The other side of our hearts. THE DAY OF OUR LADY OF TEARS A feast in the village In Aguas Altas, the procession in honor of Our Lady of Tears has a special meaning this year. Faces reflect the gravity of the decision they're about to make: will the site stay open or will it disappear like the old village? "Aguas Altas vs Multinationals" "Down with Drinam" "Save our site!" Yes for the road, the helicopter and the post office. For the roofs, the government supports Aguas Altas' candidacy for World Heritage. For the football team... Some things even the government can't do. What guarantees do we have? Signed by the Prime Minister himself. Only villagers in the church. Non-villagers over there. Today's decision will be heard far beyond the village. One thing is sure, no matter what happens, not everyone will be happy at the end of the day. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. - Amen. As Mayor, I want you to think carefully before voting. For Aguas Altas is, and will always be, our village. We should accept the government's offer. If we sell the site to Drinam, we'll be hated by all of Portugal. By the whole world. We have to decide on our own. We shouldn't listen to others. It's time. Let us vote, my brothers. Mario. Sell to Drinam! And the Spanish invasion? The Spanish? What I don't like is orders from Lisbon. Who hasn't voted? Ignacio. The Engineer, Geronimo. And Father. Sell the site to Drinam. But you said the site was a symbol of our faith! What the Lord gives, He can take away. And He saw that our spiritual well-being was in danger. God's spoken through Father Felicidade. Ignacio? It's your turn. I'm torn. I accept the government's offer. But I want to sell it to Drinam too. Ignacio, my son, it's one or the other. The government's offer. No! Sell the site to Drinam! It's a tie. - Pedro! - We know what the Engineer wants. The Engineer has the right to vote like the rest of us. Anyone who doesn't agree will have to deal with me. How do you vote, brother? Like Ignacio. Sell to Drinam? And accept the government's offer. The world is waiting to see how the village voted. Mr. Mayor, what did the village decide? Pedro? Why is no one answering? Concha! - How are you? - Fine. And you? Que guapa! - Did you miss me? - Si. Mucho. It's Concha. Aguas Altas has decided to keep the site open. By unanimity. Thank you, thank you. We have more good news. Aguas Altas, unanimously again, has also decided to partner with Drinam. We're renting them our village name for ten years. In a situation where all expected winners and losers, Aguas Altas found a way where everyone won. Once again, it shows Portuguese ingenuity has no limits. One, two, three. One, two. I'm Concha. Victor's fiance. Then who's the other Concha? The village has something important to tell you. The village has decided it doesn't want the road. You don't want the road? Too much confusion. To the magic of Dornes, where the film was shot.
