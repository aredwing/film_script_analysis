Her? l don't see any antlers, do you? lt's not even season yet. Well, l didn't think it should go to waste. l mean, l know venison is expensive, but Jesus.

What's going on? Not much. You want me to lock up for you? Yeah. lt's about that time. How was your shift? Fucking boring. Whole goddamn town shuts down at nine o'clock. What else is new? Are you OK? You don't look so good. l got a call this morning. From who? Cheri. So? She's pregnant. Are you sure it's yours? Of course it's mine! Whose the fuck else would it be? l'm sorry. l didn't mean anything. Don't worry about it. Just, it's fine. What are you gonna do? What do you think? She's gotta get an abortion, right? That's expensive. Well, no shit, it's fuckin' expensive. That's my problem. How much? Five hundred dollars. Guess a two-dollar condom's lookin' pretty good... right about now. That's just it. We were always safe. l don't know how this could've happened. There's not much point in worrying about it now. We're closed. Well, he's in there. He works here. Please. We'll be really fast. l promise. Come on. Duff, l cashed out already. -You're a prince. -Thanks. Those doughnuts are old. Doesn't matter. What's in there? Uh, Bong Water. Six. Keep the change. You want one? Yeah, they're old. Blah! She got any money? No. Her dad buys her everything... and this is obviously one bill... that she doesn't want him to see. Well, what about you? l blew my wad on the new transmission last month. So what are you gonna do? Well, that's what l've been thinking about all day. l could ask my dad, but there's just no way. l thought about asking Lloyd for an advance... but you know how he is. Yeah. So that only leaves one thing. l'm gonna rob this place. Yeah, right. No way. No fucking way. Lloyd finds one bill missing... and he's gonna fire me, and l need this job. My sister's sick. You know that. l know, and l'm sorry, but l don't have a choice. Well, take it on your own shift. l can't. She needs the money tomorrow. Why? Because her parents are gonna be gone all day. lt's the only time she can go. Well, she's just gonna have to wait. You're not taking any money from here tonight... and that's that. l don't believe this. Please, Buzzy, just give me the money? You gonna shoot me, huh? Buzzy. Would you shoot Cheri if l needed money? Oh, come on. Why do you always have to do this? Well, would you? Just tell Lloyd you were robbed. ls that so hard? l'm a bad liar. But you won't be lying. lt's not like he's got surveillance or anything. He's been looking for a reason to fire me anyway. Are you gonna give me the money or not? Look... you know l wanna help you. Don't ask me to do this. Melinda's got no insurance. She needs every dollar we've got. Just--Come on. Just-- No. You do what you gotta do... but l'm not gonna open up this drawer. God. Damn it. Look at me. Why, so you can shoot me in the face? Come on. Just look at me. God damn it, you're so stubborn! Lloyd's an idiot if he fires you! Christ, he should make you the manager! Jesus. Hey. Hey. l gotta talk to you. OK. Be right back. What's up? Did you get the money? What the fuck is wrong with you?! l didn't mean to. Why?! l didn't mean anything. Give me that fucking thing. Better get you out of here. l'm dead. l'm--l'm so dead. Hey, could l borrow your jacket? lt's cold out. Yeah. l love you. All right, you can blame this on the robber. Say he shot and missed. Will you stop thinking about your own problem... for one minute? l'm trying to save my job! Buzzy, l am saving your job. Think about it. The cops are probably on their way already. How much cash is in the register? Duffy, no. You're not thinking. You're not thinking things clearly here, OK? This way, you get to keep your job... and then seven hundred dollars goes straight to Melinda. Good. No, just take it all. l'll get mine later. Wait. One thing you have to do for me before you go. -What? -Shoot me. What?! Lloyd will know l'm lying in a second. But if you shoot me... l'm hurt, he can't ask any questions. Are you out of your mind? No, l'm serious, Duffy. l need this job. l can't! Duffy? No. No. l'll tell Cheri about that time last summer. You wouldn't. All right. All right. Um, wait. No. Go over here. That way it'll look like it's a real robbery, you know? All right, good thinking. All right. OK. All right. Where do you want it? ln my arm. Wait. l'm right-handed. Here. My left arm. All right. Here. There? Yes. You can't shoot through my arm. -All right, are you sure? -l'm sure. -OK, right here. -Yeah. Yeah. Yes. You ready? You ready? Ow! God. Ow? That's nothing compared to what it's gonna feel like. Have you thought about what it's gonna feel like? lt's gonna hurt. Go. Ready? Goddamn it! l can't fucking do it! lt's the worst idea you ever had! Duffy, you have to do this. l can't do it. As my friend, just do it. l want you to do it. Just make it quick before l think. All right. We'll do it on three, OK? Yeah. Yeah! Three...three...three... -You ready? -Yeah. One-- Ow! Ow! Oh, my God! l'm so fucking sorry! l'm so fucking sorry! Ow! You said on three! l thought you might flinch. l didn't wanna hit the bone. What can l do? l'm really sorry. l'm so sorry! l didn't mean-- Then get me something for my arm! OK. l'm sorry. Oh, God. Oh, God, does it hurt? Yes! This was your idea! lt's not working! Give it to me! Get the phone! OK, the phone. Why? l can't call 9-1-1. l'm not supposed to be here. Well, then, get it for me! OK. lt's not here. The phone's not here! Where's the fucking phone?! The pager! Hit the pager! Ow! Oh! What the hell did you put it over here for?! Who puts the fucking phone on the fucking shelf? Ow! OK, here. Here. Here. Here. No, this side. Go. Yeah. Uh... Hi. What is your emergency? Uh, l was shot. l'm all alone now, and l need an ambulance. Keys? Fuck! Thank you, baby. Calm down.
