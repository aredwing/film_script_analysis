All characters and situations depicted in this film are a work of fiction. This region is all Gangnam. It's got easier access to Seoul than other satellite cities. It's the golden goose. What? The land is pure gold it looks ripe for picking. How did you like Northern Seoul? Too close to North Korea. As a business move it must be out of their reach. Let's go with this one. Put together an epic plan, Moon. GANGNAM BLUES Uncut version. LEE MIN-HO. KIM RAE-WON. Son of a... Hold up, man. Honey, come here! Wanna be taken away? There's nothing in there. Shut the fuck up. Hey, you! Jong-dae! Run! Run! Hey! Come! Fuck. - Shit! - Run! Son of a bitch. Stop there! Fucking asshole. Stop! Head! Look at it don't you see the scale? You take me for a blind? What did you say? You messed with the scale! You little shit! - Fuck, man. - "Fuck"?! Hey! Bro! Don't, just chill. You fucking shit! Written and directed by YOO HA. So fucking cold, why is the spring so cold? Fucking hell... Building Demolition Notice. Where are we supposed to go? Why should we leave? We gotta hold out I can't stand it! Another way to use a bulb! Fuck! You'll get electrocuted. Better than freezing to death. Fucking hell... When will we sleep in a warm house? Bro. Why don't we work at a factory in Seoul? Idiot, they won't hire anyone without an ID. We could go out with a bang. What? Let's rob a bank. It'll get us a nice new home. A private room for sure. In jail. So fucking cold... Who the fuck? Sons of bitches! - Fuck off! - Who the fuck are they? We told you to leave months ago! Fuck off! No! Mister, stop! - Mister! - Stop it! It's our home! You wanna get yourself killed?! That asshole... Pull him down! Shit! Son of a bitch! Motherfucker! I'm relieved already. Sit down. Jang Duk-jae, the muscle Yang Ki-taek, the brain. Nam Soon-chm, the manpower. As you may have heard, just crash the convention. The election must be interrupted. Yes, sir. Once you wrap this up, you'll get the West Seoul business permits. There'll be plenty of work. Councilor Suh. After the job's done, how should we divide the permit? Nam! This is all for the good of our country! Let's talk about that later. Split the permit equally between you three I got work in MD so come see me too. Raise your glasses. Jang and Yang are involved, so do it right. We gotta get into Seoul this time. Please reconsider. About what? With politicians involved I don't think this is our fight. Kil-su, we just need the permit from councilor Suh. Grow some gangster balls. Son of a bitch! They got work tomorrow. As you were. You fucking pest! How dare you raise your hand! Fearless young fucks. Please forgive us something came over us. Fucking idiots I'd like to see you try again let's see it! I'm on the phone, asshole! What about Younghwa boys? Okay, I got it. Afternoon, boss. Got everyone? I could only gather 40 or so, boss. No more? Even if we get the young'uns, there's no more. Who are they? They're nuisances from the shantytown. We brought them for re-education. Put them on the bus. Sir? Boys. Come to Seoul with me. My stomach... So much money for filling in for a fight. More than what we make in a month. Dammit... Now that we're homeless should we join the gang? Dream on. - They don't accept ragmen. - You can take a beating. If you take all their hits maybe they'll take us in. Son of a bitch. All right, listen up! We are now affiliates of the Peace Party. Walk in like party members and crash the convention. Trash everything in sight and retreat, got it? Yes, boss! Tear them a new one! - Get them! - Wipe them out! Destroy everything! I can't hold it in I'll be back. Stay here! - Bro! Where are you going?! - I'll be back! Get them out! Come on out, councilors. Fucking cowards! Get them all out! Why are you hiding there? So pitiful! Open up! Get the hell out! Son of a bitch! Fuck them up! Fucking asshole! Come on out! Fucking bastards! Son of a bitch! The Peace Party. Out! Everyone out! Out! Back on the bus! Bro! Come on, move out! Bro! Yong-gi! Yong-gi! Bro! Bro! Baek Yong-gi! The Peace Party Convention Crashed by Gangsters. Councilors Park and Suh. You should have been more discrete I'm sorry, sir. We didn't think the media would be all over it. How will you spin this? Councilor Suh I hear you got the hillbillies involved. Since he's in charge of the finance, you should resign. All right I'll take the heat Don Nam says we could rejoin YDP in a month. But our family is getting smaller by the day. They'll sniff the money soon. Once we get the permit they'll all come back. Ragman, why're you here? Did my brother come here? Still haven't found him? No. What about the station? I looked everywhere for him. Boy, he probably spent all your pay on booze. Off you go! Are you deaf? Boss. Could you let me stay here? You want to join the gang? I can fight pretty good. And I may come across my bro here. It's not much, but please enjoy. Thank you I'll go heat up his room. Go on. Eat. Thank you. - How old? - 23, sir. Folks? I got none I met Yong-gi in the orphanage. But I got one. - It's yours. - Just eat. Excuse me. Would you open the door? Okay. This... Yes... Thank you. The room will get warm soon. Where the hell is he? So nice and warm. - Son of a bitch! - Boss! Goddammit! Daddy! Daddy! Are you okay?! Sun-hye! Run! Sun-hye, get away! Get away! - Just go! - Daddy! Daddy! Boss! Boss! Are you okay?! Daddy! Boss! Your leg okay? Yes. Thank you for coming to see Don Nam off. Who was it? Could be our rival gang. Cops are looking into it, and some are in hiding. Probably enforcers from the opposition party. A retaliation for the party convention I could've been offed too. Come see me in Seoul. This way, sir. Our boys. Where did they all go? They packed up and left. Our don's dead and with your retirement rumor, they all fled. It's better this way. You should leave too. What? Find a better way of life. This is not the way to live 3 years later. Mr. Yoon... Don't! Don't kill me! I'll sell! Please! No, no! Please don't! Don't kill me! I'll sell it! You're very proficient for a young man. Thank you, sir. He's a great candidate to run the hotel. Don't let hooligans come in and go I'll settle things with Jang so don't worry, sir. Yong-gi. Put the package in his car. Yes, sir. What is it? Leftover cash after taking over Daewong Hotel. Without greed, you'll go far. Councilor Park forces us to do dirty jobs and takes most of leftovers. He's the ruling party's heavyweight. To get his protection we gotta put up with this. Why did Don call you in? He told me to run the hotel. He really makes me look fool. So what did you say? It's Don's order. There's nothing to say. I didn't ask you, did I? You fucking flunkey I'm the middle boss here. Yong-gi. You gotta educate your boys about manners. She was probably lonely I can understand falling for a gigolo, but she handed over our property deed, that bitch! Consider yourself lucky. She could've sent you poison-soaked food. Don't joke about it, my ancestors are buried in it! Family issues should be dealt in the family I'm ashamed to face my ancestors! I worked in the Saudi desert for this. Please get it back. Hey! Come out for a sec I'll get to the point. Wrap up your business here. What's the matter now? If you got eyes, look around you. This place's gathering dust can't even cover the electricity bills I didn't put you in charge to run chores for chump change. We're hiring good dancers so the sales will go up soon. No, I'm dropping the cabaret so look elsewhere. You know we're here to pay you the laundromat debt. Before I tell Mr. Kang about what you do here, pack up. Oh honey! Baby! Feels good? - So good! - Amazing! Let's sell more land! - Look at that swindler. - We'll do great things! Holy shit! What the fuck?! Who... are you? Hello there I'm your father, asshole! You piece of shit! Her husband's earning dollars for our country! And what do you do? You filthy... I'm gonna fucking kill you come with me! Hold still, asshole! Where's the deed? What? You got it from her where is it? What do you mean? Oh yeah? What should we do with him? We gotta follow the Saudi law. An eye for an eye, a dick for a dick. Fucking douchebag! Do you still call yourself a fucking man? Pull it out. Why are you doing this... Let me see your balls, asshole! Sir! Sir! I don't have the deed! I sold it... Excuse me, ladies and gents. Who's madame Min? What's this about? I'm from the Gimhae Kim gang I'd hate to ruin this brunch should we talk elsewhere? Heard about the missing hotel owner? Was it you? Ownership of Daewong Hotel was changed to your boy. Coincidence? I'm a businessman now I don't order hits anymore. You insubordinate bastard! Businessman? I created a monster by giving a hooligan a suit. Look here, Yang. Even a prick like you shouldn't bite the hand that feeds you I won't say it again revert the hotel ownership I wish I could, but it's out of my hands now. Heading up MD clan was an ego booster, huh? Should I pull out my knife for once? Councilor Suh. The one took over the hotel is councilor Park. Councilor Park? I'm back. Welcome. Have you had dinner? Not yet I was waiting for you. Where's Sun-hye? Off for the night. Things okay on your end? Factories are shutting down due to recession. We're okay. That's good. Not easy finding work nowadays. Oh yeah. Today was payday. Even got bonus this month. Don't give me that anymore. Start thinking about your future I'm good. What's with the feast? On the best table, no less. Today's your birthday. Birthday? I don't have one. There's nothing to it. It's a chance for a family to share a meal. You joined our family on this clay. You were born at some point and I felt bad about skipping it. You didn't have to I know things aren't good. Come on, try the seaweed soup. Okay. Delicious! I put my heart into it so eat every last drop. You're ready to be a housewife. When'll you and Chang-bae get a promotion? I'm not sure yet. Is that meat? If you wanted to start over then do it in the boonies. Why come to Seoul and start a cleaner with my money? You're a thorn in my side! I helped you out for the sake of Don Nam, but even my patience has an end. The way you look now you'll never repay that debt I'll get another loan if I have to, give me some time. Gangsters shouldn't wash clothes. If you don't clear out by next week, I'll burn everything here! Just wait and see. Councilor Suh's one thing but Jang'll not let this slide. Don't drop your guard. Yes, boss. Yong-gi, how's the hotel? Yes, I'm doing my best, sir. You run businesses in Moogyo area, too. Boss, take care of Kyung-pyo too. Yong-gi's doing all the hard work. Kyung-pyo, quit heroin first. Yes, sir. Let's go, honey. Sure I got this tonight. Ma'am, this way. Yong-gi. Let me manage the casino and restaurant here. Let's go half-half. Cool? Not at all. What? Didn't you hear the man? You backstabbing bastard! I took you in, and raised you and now you're all grown up? Well now. Don't make a scene. People here will see you for who you are. Son of a bitch! Couldn't we... go live down in the south? Anything will be better than now. People are coming to Seoul because there's nothing else. So what then? Just be patient. Evening, boss. What's going on? Not castrating the gigolo brought us good fortune. Hey man! This place is pumping tonight! For a swindler he's down to earth. Evening, sir! These are the dancers I manage how do you like them? Good work. Least I can do for leaving my livelihood intact. Fucking douche. Have you told the madame? Should I give her a visit? She's here now I apologize for before. He told me about your situation. How much do you need? If you could swing $50,000 I'll pay it back in 4 months. It's not pocket change. Come on, sis help him out. Look at that earnest face of his. It's a big favor. All right. But I want something in return I'm looking into lands in Gangnam and I need a play date. What do you mean? You know how naive farmers are. With a little persuasion it'll be an easy picking. You want to cheat them? $5 million from Daehyun Corp $3 million from Geuma, $2 million from Kyungsin Daily. We're far too short. We can't win the general election like this. Everyone's saving up due to recession. Should I crack down on them? Bastards... They'll come to when the commies run wild. How can a company exist without a country? We must regain power before commies take over I'll pressure them more. Buy up Gangnam lands. Land? It's all for the good of our nation. We'll flip lands and fill up our war chest. Will that be profitable enough for the campaign? What if we move the capital to Gangnam? Sir? Seoul's overpopulated it needs to expand. That's enough of a reason. Buy 3 million square meter for now. Afterwards, we'll officially announce the development. When that happens the market will go insane I see I understand your intent. There's no time. See the head of KG Bank tomorrow. He'll give you a fat check. Yes, director, I'll take care of it. Be discrete. If this reaches the President, we're both finished. This is my private business after all I'll take the heat 3rd Han River Bridge Now Open. First time riding a car? - It's over here, idiot! - Fuck off! - I got it. - Dammit! Don't push me, asshole! Holy shit. We're in the boonies. Where's the petting zoo? Memorized your lines, right? Remember our plan. Yes, boss. Just be natural. Big boss at the laundromat we run real estate. We didn't leave the factory for this. We arrive in a hard hat, leave in a suit. Our days will come soon. How about getting apartment parcel in Banpo? Good ones are like real estate lotto. Not everyone can get it I could tie up my tubes. What? Men who get vasectomy have advantage. Since overpopulation is a problem nowadays. Those shooting blanks get the upper hand. Goddammit... I could get it reversed it's simple! Jong-dae! Come on! $30 per 3 square meter. Forget it, $80, take it or leave it $30 is still a lot I'll buy the whole lot. Ma'am, sign with the other one. One moment please. This lot is designated to be a park. Hey! Lee, a bit to the left. To your left! What are you doing on my land! - We're surveying. - What for? 5m more, goddammit! You must really need quick cash. You said you wouldn't sell it for even $50. We got them for dirt cheap, but why buy up worthless lands? Just you wait. With the dirt cheap lands we acquired, we buy and sell to each other, and drive up the market. And when others get a wind of it, we'll sell in one full sweep. How? Press Vehicle. The market rises when media drops by. The market depends on the rich's whim. We just have to use that. - Excuse me. - How can we help? Kyungsin Daily Newspaper You are a newspaper reporter. That orchard near here. Could we meet the owner? Everyone's asking about that land. That should do it. Good. Now we go for the kill. Not at that price! A newspaper publisher came by and I rejected her $150 offer! I'll pay $50 more! Are you kidding me? - I'm off. - Please! We made a mint, thanks. Real estate business is something. Korea's tiny. Just watch. There's no better way to make money. Here, 100 grand. This is way too much. Half is for the next job up front. Next job? There's an opportunity in Apgujeong. It's a risky job. Take care of it. If you can't pay your debt your land will do! Get in! Isn't that Jang? Yeah, it is. Bring the pear orchard owner too. Sir. Goddammit... YDP clan really did wonders to our ugly duckling. So it was YDP, who took over this lot. Madame Min, that fox Let's forget Apgujeong. Let's just do it. What? Jang'll draw blood without a flinch. It's delicious. As a child, I envied children on picnics with their parents and eating this. We could... go on picnics too later. Honey, I have to go. Already? Yang's coming in today. Eat everything there I'm off. Yong-gi. Been a while. Good night. Sun-hye. Oh, hey! Coming home now? It's late I was at Jung-min's place. Why didn't he drop you off at home? I wanted to get off here I didn't tell him about the laundromat. It'll all come out eventually I should delay the wedding. Why? We're so much in debt and I don't want to burden him. Just focus on the wedding I'll take care of the debt. Came for a show?! Don't leave anything! Burn everything. Get house items too. Get the furniture too. Get everything out! Sure. Go back to your fucking life! Go away! I'll fucking beat you! Get everything out! Burn everything they got! There's nothing to watch! Nice and toasty. Motherfuckers! - Son of a bitch! - Hot! Come at me! Son of a bitch! What the fuck. Jong-dae! Fucking asshole! Here! Listen carefully I'll pay back every cent soon. Don't you ever bother us again. If you do, I will kill you. It's not Chang-bae's fault I convinced him to leave the factory with me I'm sorry for deceiving you all this time. But now that you know trust me with this I'll rebuild our clan and bring you back. Why do you think I left that life behind? I was cuffed and stabbed in front of my daughter. How can I call myself a father? Even if you're penniless live like a human first. That is all. Boss. Laundry will earn you $5 a day. When'll we live like humans? Welcome, boss! Min's making us do her dirty work. - I got it. - Where? Certification of Property Transfer It's the land madame Min wanted. - Bag. - Okay. Shit... We're fucked they're Jang's boys. Get him out. Get up, asshole! Stand up! Get him up. Son of a bitch. On your feet. Daddy! Stop wasting our time and spill it. Did you kill Daewong Hotel's Yoon? I saw him a few times. What? Let me go I'll look the other way. You son of a bitch! Boss. He's got Suh's support why not let him go? Okay, bring him out. We got everything let's jet I gotta see this through see you back home. - What the hell! - I'll be back. Where are you going, Jong-dae! I'm breaking sweat thanks to him I'll fucking kill you all! Fucking hell! Motherfuckers! Fucking asshole! Fuck! Goddamn you! Son of a bitch! Bro! You Okay? Jong-dae... What the hell happened?! Jong-dae... Goddammit, Yong-gi! Boss... Madame Min knows some powerful people, whatever happens it'll get solved quickly. You disobedient bastard! You have the balls to utter those words?! Go look for him! - Boss! - Jong-dae! Shouldn't you go to the ER? I'm fine, sir. It's late please head back. Even if you go back to MD don't mention Jong-dae. Of course not. Good evening. You and I can't catch a break. About what? How could you also be in a gang? Be thankful that I'm not a bank robber. Same shit. Why were they after you? It's a feud over some land don't worry. Did you look for me? I held memorial services for you I thought you were dead. Fucking bastard you prayed for me to disappear. Where the heck did you go? I took the wrong bus. When I came to I was in Don Yang's group. You should've came back. Didn't want to die as a ragman I wanted to be a made man before I reached out. Then? Did you at least buy a house? Buddy. We've to stick together now I manage all of their accounts I'll give you half. Fuck you. You haven't changed I'm serious, I'm not the same man. Fine, I'll join you later I'm with Mr. Kang right now. Tread carefully. A gangster's future depends on whom he serves. Ministry of Commerce in Samseong, city hall in Nonhyun, and business district in Yeoksam. Daechi is a riverside, but it's designated for housing so the profit will be huge. Bulldoze the shanties there and kick out all residents. Yes, sir. Any problems? We need your help with a few construction companies and Suh. Suh Tae-gon? He's buying up lands in Gangnam. They're after the price hike... Why does he have hand in everything! Please take care of him, sir. You do it. They're asking why Intelligence is into real estate. But this is in national interest. We must win the election in order to go after the commies. Property Sale Contract. Thanks to you the financiers are happy. You'll get the rest when the market hikes. Pay me with land. Land? I want something of my own 1,500 square meter should do I'm getting the short end of the stick. Since this one's signed, I'll take this. Apgujeong celery field. Is that okay? Sure. But why the ruse over paddy fields? It could be the golden goose with political support. You must meet a lot of politicians here. A few. Madame. Could you introduce me? Heard of councilor Suh? He's really well-known in real estate. Isn't he YDP clan's financier? Right, he's been buying up Gangnam lands. He could be a good fit for you. Jang won't like that very much. When I came across Yong-gi I saw him. Who? The one who stabbed you. He was under Jang. Jang killed Don Nam, didn't he? Wasn't Suh supposed to hand out the business permits? What're you implying? Is that why Jang and Yang killed Don Nam? That's bullshit Why do You care? How could I not? Who led us to this shithole? You knew, didn't you? It's all in the past, let it go. We need our debt back. Aren't you even mad about your leg? You must really be mad now that you've tasted money. Mr. Kang! If you keep at it you and I are done! How much did you pay Suh?! Just tell me that I didn't give any. Interrogation Room Central Intelligence Agency. That's it! It's time for you to spread your wings. Those in power won't easily give that up I got into politics unexpectedly, but the ardor one can overwhelm it. Councilor Suh?! Our country's going to shit. You sons of bitches! Is this the cocktail revolution? While the country sleeps you're sucking on whore tits?! Why did you arrest Jang? You are to tie something up between him and me? Are you afraid of him about something? Why are you fussing about it? Who suggested using the gang to trash the convention? I took the heat for the entire ordeal! You should at least feel grateful for what I've done! So what do you want? Let Jang go if you don't want trouble. As your friend, I'll make this clear. Don't align your business with petty gangsters. You won't rejoin the party, let alone secure a nomination. Hey Park, you ain't the only with clout in Gangnam. Stop investigating him. By the way why did they arrest Jang? The reason is obvious for a person like Jang. Illegal political funds. He could be Suh's roadblock. They'll release Jang soon but roadblock is still there. You can't be sure Jang will keep his mouth shut. Why you ask? Min, introduce me to Councilor Suh. You know you're not supposed to be here. You were unreachable for days how could I not? What's this about? Yang wants me to move in. He bought an apartment under my name. Just say you won't. Tell him yourself. Why? Are you scared? You're the one who seduced him this is your problem. What? Mr. Baek, you're a real bastard. Hey. Hey! So-jung! - What's with you? - Like You don't know? I'm sorry, I have plans so be patient. Forget it! So-jung. Honey! Hey, Yong-gi. Why's it so hard to see you? What's up? We never finished our last conversation. Now there's another wrinkle. What wrinkle? Who does she belong to? Is So-jung... our boss's bitch? Or yours? What exactly is she? Should I ask the boss? Yong-gi... Don't be so greedy. Us, henchmen, have to stick together I'm on your side. What do you want? Keep managing the hotel I'll count the money. Hard hat for you Gucci for me I'm a fucking gangster! You fucking dope fiend! Are you nuts?! This is insane! Listen. How long must we go after the little guys? Let's remove Jang and go to the major league. Chauffeuring the madame gave you ideas? You think YDP clan is a kiddie club? How can we accomplish that? I heard that Jang's captured I didn't see his minions either I can't believe what you're saying! What do you propose? We can't go head-to-head. This is our best shot. Hey what's going on? Why didn't you come in? What is it? What's with your hand? I'm fucked I killed my own. What? I must have snapped. When I came to I thought of you. What do I do? What now? Gotta find a way. Maybe join you. Shit, it's so fucked up I've reached so far... Join me. You can't handle me. If Yang finds out, he won't let you breathe. Bro. Let's go to YDP. If we join Suh even Yang can't touch us. What a load of bull! What's wrong with a laundromat?! If they're so ashamed why bother?! I won't send you off like this! Call it off! Daddy! It's not an unreasonable request. We just don't have to mention it during the wedding. You must be so desperate to leave. It's hard enough with the debt. Call it off! I heard you have a career-minded son. He's supposed to come he must be running late. What the fuck! What the fuck! I know you're good at reading people, how about him? Doesn't have a traitor's eyes. Right? I really like how he handled my jobs I'll let you two talk alone Kim Jong-dae, is it? - Have a drink. - Yes, sir. Thank you. We've crossed paths once, sir. Where? At Don Nam's funeral, sir I serve Mr. Kang Kil-su. Kang Kil-su? You're one of his? Yes, sir. Then you must know Jang. A little bit, sir. Will you be okay? He'll be hard to handle. He's already taken care of. What? He won't be dragging you down anymore. Sir, please give me a shot. Gangsters are used and tossed, am I right? You idiot... who asked you to do this! Got a death wish?! Son of a bitch... You really tied my hands. If you're so desperate to be a gangster, leave. Get the hell out! Mr. Kang. As a member of your clan I'll be working for Suh. Please forget this shop and join YDP with me. He's succeeding Jang as head of YDP, so play nice. Yes, sir! Now! For councilor Suh and our new boss! - Cheers! - Cheers! Where's Kil-su? He'll join us shortly. Yes, very good, great! The friend behind the groom. Polka dot lady, point your chin a bit. Turn your face a little. Great, here we go! Smile! One, two, three! Okay, here we go! Look happy! The groom looks too happy! One, two, three! Lovely! They don't suspect a thing. They're all busy with the councilor Park job. It's not safe, you're stepping on a mine. While at it let's hit Yang too. What? We're already knee deep in shit. We can take over MD businesses I'm not interested in that I didn't join YDP for a turf war. Then what? Remember how hard it was without a room? I'm gonna help Suh and buy up tons of land. So join me. You can build a nice condo there. All right I'll think about it. Bro, watch me. It'll be my land, as far as I can reach! All right! Land for you money for me! Let's go all the way! Slow and smooth. Quick! Quick! Stop! You guys need a bootcamp training! You call that dance? You got blue balls?! You need pelvic thrust! How'll you seduce Gangnam cougars like this! Feel the mood. And down she goes. Next up! Use your thigh! Rub into her crotch and boom! Ow! Now. Put one of these in your pocket. And hit it. Out comes her deed. Here we go! Hey sweetie! Hurry up! Our club is promoting healthy dance culture, and for all of you ladies who work tirelessly on the field, once a year! No! Twice! Our service is entirely for you all! Ma'am. Come to Seoul with me. Registration Certificate. Heard of chairman Hur at Husam Construction? Yes. You can't go to Gangnam without stepping on his land. This is his Yeoksam lot the deal isn't going well. Since it's City Development division's, it'd be weird if it wasn't I'll hand over any troubling deals to you, so take care of them. Yes, boss. How about Councilor Suh? He lost most of his power. He won't be a trouble. If you don't own the land you must vacate! You have to defect before too late. One false move and it's all over. Let's just stay. Sir? Kyung-pyo's incident will be buried. There's no good reason to work for Jong-dae I'll just become one of his damn minions. But we have to use him to snap Yang's neck Yang ain't that easy. Then will you give up removing him? Gotta use Jong-dae for that. He's crazy about lands, so he'll take Yang's seat if we slip him Park's insider info. Sir! Wake up! Get up! Come on! Wake the fuck up! Get up! Now! Get the hell up! What the fuck did you do?! She's dead! Good work. Stay out of sight for a while. Your son did a lot of drugs. This could interfere with our shop so we'll keep it under wraps. Have you contacted her family? She doesn't have any. How much will do? Chairman Hur. Didn't you buy some Yeoksam lands? Ownership Certificate You did better than Jang. How did you get to Hur? He loves his son more than anything. Great work. But it's still not nearly enough. It's gotta be significant to convince the party to take me back. Real estate is still the best way to make big bucks I'll try my best. There's no time. If we had some leads we could go all in. Leads, sir? An insider info! Firm source! Let's go. Who has Hur's deed? Kang Kil-su? Speak, you fuck! How dare you pull the rug under us! Where's Kang? After offing Jang what deal have you made with Suh? It's in Suh's hands already. There's no point in finding Kang. You fucking piece of shit! Call YDP and tell them to bring Hur's deed. They'll bring it to save one of their own. Yes, boss. Is Jong-dae safe? Yes I got a call from them. Why are they asking for a deed? I slipped real estate tip it must've turned bad I'm sorry. Afternoon, boss. Get some noodles. Sure, I'll make a fresh pot. Not for me. We have to treat our guest. - Eat and get ready. - Yes, boss! Get the tools it's almost time. Sure. Get ready. The boys are ready, sir. When we get the deed kill him yourself. Sure. Look who it is. Been a while, Mr. Kang. Where is he? - Fetch him. - Right away. Did you bring the deed? Come out, you fuck. Come the fuck out! Check it out! Who the hell?! Fucking bastards! I'm your grim reaper! Jong-dae! Get Kang! Motherfucker! Come at me! You bitch! Jong-dae! Jong-dae! Die already! Jong-dae! You Okay? Jong-dae! You incompetent fucks! You had an army! You couldn't even take care of one job? I can overlook these boys! But you? No more work ethics? No excuses, sir I think we have a mole, sir. What? He may've offed Kyung-pyo and leaked info to Kang. Fucking moron! Are you here on a stroll? Do something about it! Suh must've got to chairman Hur I'm working on it so please be patient I've had it with him. Deal with him at once. Eat this and regain your health. Stay low for a while I'm sorry... No, I'm paying you back for everything you've done for me. And I'm closing the shop like you wanted. What? I'll take care of my boys so stay here and recover. Arrest all the gangsters! Run! Come here! This way! What's going on?! Get in! Do you know who I am?! Sons of bitches! Who do you work for?! I won! Bra off! Here we go! Mr. Moon! Have a drink I can't bear to watch! You're more modest than I expected. By the way Jamsil is a sandy field. Just buy it up Sandy fields become gold fields. Your pen moves mountains so I'll hold you to that. Sometimes, valleys too! Sweetie! Where's Yang? He just left. Don't make me do this again. So-jung. What are you doing? Come out. What? Come out of his house. If you can't I'm gonna kill him. Wasn't this Park's private business? He's working under an order. And I'm the architect! It'll all turn to gold when the plan is announced. If this leaks we're both dead. Shit... So they're finally coming to Gangnam. Let's not touch Park I think he's got powerful connections. Risky moves pay off big. But it's too dangerous. Join us before it's too late. Mr. Kang's joining YDP I wanted to do this properly but I dragged him in. Boss! It's me. We got a situation the cops rounded up everyone! What? It's probably because of Suh. Where's Mr. Kang? He turned himself in in your place. You have to take off! Hey! - Calm down! - Move aside. - And do what?! - I gotta go to the station. You fuck! Bastard, what will that do? I even got stabbed to get to where I am! - Turn around. - Hurry up! Raise your heads. Yo, Kang Kil-su. Shame on you. Leeching off honest farmers at your age. Stand up straight, assholes! Come out, bitch! Don't you dare come back without money! I have nothing to do with your money then why should I be thrown out! It's some gangsters who took the money. Gangster like your brother! Be gone, you bitch! Don't get the money don't ever come back. Open the door! Open it! Open the door, you bastard! 20 Kang Kil-su clan members arrested. Prolific politicians involved in real estate corruption. Kang Kil-su. Who is it? Sun-hye? What's wrong? What happened to your face? Sun-hye. Who was it? Who did this to you? Jong-dae... If she's from a gangster family at least be obedient. My company isn't doing well, what's wrong with getting her to get some money? I got fed up and slapped her! This will calm you down. What is it? A small contribution to your business. Brother-in-law. Don't ever, hit her. Boss. Councilor Suh's out. Taxi! Taxi! This is far more dangerous than Hur's son job. If we can get a solid lead, Suh will help free Mr. Kang. - No mistakes. - Are you okay? What the hell! I didn't see you there I'm sorry, are you hurt? Are you okay? Ma'am, I'll take care of this please go ahead. You'll be late. How can I just leave when a man is hurt? Tell them I'm not coming I bumped up the amount on the contract by 10%. Here is the difference. Good. Have them under my boy's name. Yes, sir. It'll have a nice view. Here. Park's bank statement. Great work. Take the picture. Wake up, fucking homos! Holy shit! What's going on! Who are you?! What a piece of work. A man's wife is not enough you take the driver too? I apologize for the madame... but I didn't sleep with the man! I'm not into men, I swear! You did the drugs but I hallucinated? Report him to the police, and send these to his wife and the city hall. Yes, sir. Please don't! Don't do this I'll be slaughtered! Please, I'm begging you! Conniving bastards... They've been playing monopoly by themselves. We kept a low profile there won't be any repercussion. - Good job. - Not at all, sir. When do you think Mr. Kang and my family will be out? You caught a big one and I'll do my part I'll get on it right away. Thank you, sir. Goddammit... After the party donation my funds are dry. Madame Min, pick one. How about Dogok by Yangjae stream? Buy that one first. Why there? A feng shui expert told me he felt mighty force from there. Even a shack there could become a palace. Say what? It's a treasure cove of a land. Once in a lifetime chance. Is that so? I'll empty my pockets and buy up this region then. But MD's already working on the best lands. Park won't let it slide if we snatch them up. Let's deal with this problem and face the consequences later. If we get the capital, there's no backlash. Buy that small mountain in Daechi area. That's just a forest. It'll become an apartment complex. How? I changed its usage. If it's a forest no one will care. You're taking out of Suh? They shouldn't have all the fun themselves. I'll take lands little by little for us. - You manage them right. - Don't worry. Hey. Cream of the crop belong to Yang what will you do? If you want the goods you'll have to face him. Once my boys get out let's get on it. Sources of the fund are unknown, and he's been siphoning party funds. Where did you get this? Park has numerous enemies. Heard of '10-Men Association'? They're already scheming the next election. With Park at the helm. Director. One can get into business with gangs, but one mustn't sell his soul doing it. With my loyalty to you, I'll clean up this mess and win the election. There's none to trust who talk about loyalty. I even wiped your boots when we were in the army. Thank you for toughing it out. Let's drink. Cheers. Cheers! Jong-dae, bro. You look good. You must've eaten well when we were in jail. What? Well, you only know how to hide so it's easy for you to let boss go to jail instead of you. Shut up! We belong to one clan but he doesn't show his heart. How can we believe him? Aren't I right? Fucking asshole! Stop it! Listen to me carefully. You've endured so much. You've functioned as my family but I never acted like the boss. Some of you may have heard in the joint, but as of today, we're done I'm handing over the business to Suwon, you're all free to move. Whose name is it under, asshole! Please, stop it! Boss, we don't need to work these minions I'm certain Kang took Moon's lot number. They covered up the land owner identities. Names were relayed a few times so it wasn't easy. But Kang's locked up. It must be his minion Jong-dae. And Kang's out. Goddammit... Where's the leak? Boss, before Park finds out why not finish off YDP? What are you doing?! Why kick them out now? You wanted me back in command. The boss can do whatever he pleases. Mr. Kang, this won't make any difference. This Suh job will be my last so please help me out. So you'll go after Yang too? If necessary. Then you'll die too I don't know what kind of deal you made with Suh to free us, but once this is over you'll follow Jang to the grave. Don't you know? Jong-dae, let it go. Even if I do I'm still a dead man I don't need to be your family please let me see this through. Hey! Bro Yang found out about our scheme, he'll move in I'll get my boys ready you should too. Kang clan's disbanded. What? It'll take time to get everyone do your best on your end. What the shit?! What right does he have? What a preposterous ass! Don't talk shit about him I'll gather some men somehow. Min-kyu! Min-kyu! Hey! What happened? Yong-gi. Baek Yong-gi! Kyung-pyo's back, all bloated and shit. What? Remember Yonggok reservoir? You buried Mr. Yoon there. His body was found there Coincidence? What was? Son of a bitch! I didn't off Kyung-pyo. Why'd I kill my own? Then... why was his body found near Yoon's? I don't know I may have revealed that spot while in YDP captivity. So it was an eye for an eye? Are you the rat? It's not fair, boss. After everything I've done for you, how could you ask me that? Boss! Believe me! I believe you. But they don't. Convince them, that you're not with Kang. - Welcome, boss. - Evening! Hey, what about the boys? - Reached them? - Yes. But I can't reach Tae-sik and Jong-su. Then go look for them yourself! Yes, sir. Follow me. Yes, boss - and Mr. Kang? - At the shop. What? Didn't you tell him? I told him but he won't listen. Shit... Where you going? He can't be alone I'll bring him here. - Boss! - Jong-dae! Please take this call. We're leaving YDP. We won't be interfering with your business, so please do not engage my boys. You have a way of turning the cogs. Sun-hye... Boss. For the sake of Don Nam's legacy, please forgive us. Motherfucking bitch! What the hell?! Goddammit! I'll fucking kill you! I'll fucking kill you! How dare you touch my sister! Why?! What brings you? Where's Jong-dae? What's wrong? It's not safe here. Yang's men are on the way. What? It's dangerous we gotta go. Maybe it's for the best. He would only get in Jong-dae's way. And I proved that I'm not in Kang's pocket. Have the boys on standby. Okay. Once Yang's buried consider Jong-dae too. There's no more use for him. If he finds out what happened he won't just take it. Don't hold ill will against the boys. You have proven your loyalty to us. Yes, sir. BOSS Since Kang's out of the way we should finish the job. Okay. Hit 'em when they're down. Yes, boss. Boys! Get ready for war! Yes, boss! Get the weapons I'm sorry, I couldn't help at all Yang must've made his move first. His men were watching me so I couldn't do anything. After the funeral we move in. Get ready. Kill them all! Wipe them out! We're here! On the double, fuckers! What the hell?! Outta my way! What the fuck! Send them all to hell! Motherfucker! Motherfuckers! Gangnam Development Plan Due to overpopulation of Seoul, and as a preemptive measure against North Korean invasion, city of Seoul will expand to include Gangnam region. Interrogation Room Central Intelligence Agency. Who are your co-conspirators? Don't wanna talk? No more nice guy for you. Are the lands up for development ready? Including Yang's lands everything's almost ready. Where's Yang? He must've fled after hearing that the Intelligence has Park. This is strictly my personal business. Eliminate anyone involved in this. Park's underlings, including, Yang, and Baek Yong-gi. Get rid of them. Yes. After that, I'll give you all the permits. Let's build them good. Which one? How about a hotel on Sinsa District? I'll do my best if you give me a chance. But no business zoning permit yet. Once I regain my seat, I'm gonna go hard on Seoul. Then they'll come down to Gangnam. With tax exemption I'll be the first in line. Okay! To our beautiful palace! Congratulations, boss! If they are happy, like doves. Build a house, with a rose garden. Following an off the beaten path, where the echoes are clear. Birds chirp cheerfully, Who was it? Baek Yong-gi! What'll you do with Yong-gi? We deal with Yang first. We needed him to hit MD but we need a decision now. What are you doing out here alone? Getting some fresh air. You look pale. Uneasy being with my men? Of course not. Your wife's beautiful. Bullshit... She's pregnant so we're rushing the wedding. That's good I hated the parents who abandoned me. But now that I'll be one it feels odd. Honey, what are you doing out? Jong-dae, please come in. Let's go inside. Oh yeah. We located Yang. Let's finish this and send Kang off well. Parents: Kang Kil-su, Park Jung-eun. Daughter: Kang Sun-hye. Son: Kang Jong-dae. So, will the war chest be filled? Certain regions have jumped 50 times the value. Getting things done with great speed. Interstate highway was completed in 2 years. Anything can be clone as a military op. But Park really messed up the plan I already have a plan in motion. Ah! Take this. What is it? An expert said that it's the best spot in Gangnam. Please use it for your business on commies. I will. You'll take a seat after the election. Boss, how are you? I'm okay. Are you all right? Sir. He's inside. Have your weapons ready. He's a sneaky fuck so we get one shot. Money? I was in a rush so I couldn't get much. So... are you under Kang's men? What? I should've listened to my men. Never thought you'd betray me. Backstabbing motherfucker... Don Yang. Let's move him to the washroom. Come on, help me. Your boys are there. - What was that? - Shit! You sons of bitches! Motherfucker! Fucking backstabber! What the hell is the matter with you?! Why did you kill Mr. Kang? What? Why'd I take him out?! They're not coming! Why did you do it? Why kill him?! That fucking cleaner... I did it for my survival! If I didn't off him I'd be six feet under. If you didn't bring Kang clan into YDP, we wouldn't be in this fucking mess, asshole! Motherfucker! Jong-dae! Listen! I'm sorry! Jong-dae, it's my fault! I'm still your brother! We only have each other! Don't kill me. Please don't kill me... Baek Yong-gi. Disappear. Mr. Kim Jong-dae. Next chapter of Seoul! For Gangnam's future! - Cheers! - Cheers! Bro. What'd have happened if our old shack wasn't demolished? Isn't it obvious? Hugging a light bulb till the end. Let's go a round it'll warm us up I'm already warmed up. Get up! The winner takes the whole blanket. Don't fuck around. Jab. Jab. Jab! I'll fucking knock you out! Float like a butterfly and sting like a bee! Sting! Hey now! I'm Joe fucking Frazier! You hurt? Joe fucking Frazier! Uppercut! Kim Jong-dae wins! Son of a bitch! His stamina's dropping! What the? What the hell! Suh Tae-gon! Suh Tae-gon!
