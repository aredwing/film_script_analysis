Are you coming, Bascar?. - lf you drive me. Goodbye! - See you tomorrow. Well then! - See you tomorrow, thanks. OK, l'll also finish now. Hearts with skulls? l don't know. - Don't you like it? l find the design too banal. l thought of mini hearts glass. You see, like this. With a crown of thorns, what do you think? - Yes, it could be pretty. Now l have to leave. - Have a nice evening. See you tomorrow. Ah, good evening. - Good evening. Rachel? - Yes? Can you reach to go through the changes with him? l want to see how far they are with the stand. Yes, no problem. - You can discuss it with her. Should l rather come Thursday?. - No, no! - Good evening. Hello. - Don't worry, this doesn't much time. l'm going up quick. So, the text of the homepage is good, clear and understandable. lt's quite large. lt appears as a site for short-sighted. - l don't think so. l don't care. lt's attractive and yet simple. Was it your idea with the corals? - Yes. - Looks great. Oh yes, that has to be different. Diane wants pass word access, so that only our customers can enter. She wants to avoid that someone steals our ideas. l see. But then you won't get new customers, People coming from the main page. We're aware of that. - Good. And the translations? Oh yes, of course! For the fair, we'll nee the side definitely in English too. We can clarify the rest later. l could ask my wife. She translates my websites. We can search the technical terms of course. Okay, perfect! And have sent a file with the photos to you. Did you see them? - Yes. Who modelled for you? A cousin of Diane, why?. - Just like that. You find her ugly. So do l. There are nicer women. l would take you. Me? - Yes. You're looking good. You have that certain something. l'm not 18, no chance. And how do you like our jewellery?. lsn't my taste. All original, but somehow too Gothic for me. Well, to Gothic for you? With Gothic you're completely wrong. But the skulls... ln the baroque period, they were a symbol of transience. A bit too dark, l think. Have l offended you now? - No. No? l better say nothing more. Help me please. How's the style of your wife? Rather modern? What she wears, for example? l'll show you a picture of her. Here! This is Teri. Englishwoman? - No, her mother's American. And these are our children. Tim, Jackie, the cat and Thelma, the great. How old is she? - Ten. You were early to become father. Yes. lt wasn't planned. An accident. Give me the phone, Tim! Yes, Rachel? l want to ask something on behalf of my husband. He wants to know whether you like to eat spicy. Well. Vincent? Too fast. - Too good. l'll answer her. Vincent. The one with the website? - Yes. Open it. That's it. Comb them always well behind, because the lice prefer laying their eggs there. l have a stomach of steel, Teri. Who is it? His wife. Stomach of steel? Oh. Presumably means that she eats just about anything. Do you feel it? What? What should l feel? - A burning. That hurts, because you press so hard. - Excuse me! One of my teachers in Beijing was 96 and had more power than l in the fingers. You've been in Beijing?. - Yes. And when? - 15 or 16 years ago. The Olympics would have thrilled me. Have you been a professional gymnast? - Sure. Have you participated? - Yes, in Seoul, '88. Do you have a medal? No, l was very young and it was totally botched. After that l had no ambition anymore. You were there again? - ln Beijing?. No. Unfortunately, Rachel doesn't like Asia. That's not true, l find the kamikaze guys great. And puzzles, l do a lot of puzzles. - You are a puzzle yourself. He means l'm a mystery to him. - No, l wouldn't say so. Not? What then? l don't know what l meant. Telephone! Rachel, it's yours. Rachel! Phone, telephone! Yes? Ah, hello Diane. What a shame. Yeah, at the moment it's around. Oh crap, that's fine. Tell her get well. See you. That was Diane. She doesn't come. Her friend is sick. What does she have? - She's constantly ill. Perhaps Pfeiffer's Glandular fever, or whatever. Or scurvy! Or... - Shingles! Shingles. - Trisomy perhaps. What nonsense. Come on, sweetheart, off to bed. Come on, sweetie, come on up! Come on. - Wait. Thank you. You're sitting on the floor?. - Back pain. From our chairs? - No, l have often especially at night. ln the museum or in a concert it's unpleasant, but otherwise its okay. ls this from the kids? No, it's from ten years of competitive sports. Let's see! Stay where you are! l'll unroll your spine, okay?. And you visualize it with me. Okay?. Take the hair to the side and bend slightly forward. Like this! We start with the neck vertebra One, two, three, four. This should loosen you up, not tickle. - Sorry. That had to get out, go ahead. - Well, relax. Put away your glass. Okay, head down. The cervical vertebra, one... ... five, six, seven and eight. Can you feel how sharp it is? Now the lumbar vertebra. One, two, three... What? - Excuse me. Damn! How awkward. - Teri, you're bleeding! lt's still bleeding but doesn't hurt. Need help? No, it's okay. Which one do you want? l don't know. l'll choose one l usually won't wear. lt's the chance! What do you prefer?. - As you see black and gray. l also like blue. - The blue one. Let me see, turn around! We make it shorter. - l don't know. Wait! Like this the chain is prettier. Yes. Come to the studio next week. That's it. - The? The hands, the key to tenderness. The sayings are not from me, only the photos and a few texts. And the trick with the vertebrae? - ls there too. lf you want you can have it. What is it? Shiatsu for couples? We're picking clothes and books here. What next? Will you write a dedication? - Yes, please. lt doesn't go away anymore. - We place the sofa over it. Are you suffering from writers' block? l've kissed Teri. Here. Thank you. ls it something personal? - You could say that. l'll read it anyway. For Teri, for Vincent, old stories, new friendship. Frank Berry. Beautiful. Without her maiden name you won't find her. Oh yes! Teri isn't so common among gymnasts. Since when do they know each other?. - You've to ask them themselves. They met for the first time while Surfing. Surfing?. Crazy. Why not even at bungee-jumping?. But somehow hot. - Who? Them? No, him. He. He plucks his eyebrows? - l found them. This is her?. Not bad. - European vice-champion of the juniors. l don't know anyone else who participated at the Olympics. Neither do l. She's quite delicate, have you seen her joints? Yes, l did. - Her neck, her shoulders... l know! - l need to shorten her necklace. Yes, that will look better. She has very thin bones, l noticed while massaging. You impressed her with your massage, l noticed it. Rachel, l've kissed her. We were kissing each other. l had Franck's book lying around in the bedroom the whole week. Perhaps Teri has opened it, perhaps she read the dedication, but we haven't talked about it. On the next evening with Rachel Franck they behaved as usual. To me she was neither nervous nor guilty nor excited. While Rachel had fun in the bar, with confusing our cocktail selection, l have been thinking about the first meeting for us four. When Diane cancelled at the phone, was l relieved or disappointed? l don't know. Did the four of us feel immediately comfortable with each other?. ls it possible to so attracted to each other at once? Did it start already then? We aren't committed to anything. - Sorry?. We don't need to do anything. Yeah, right. Do you like it sweet or less sweet? Are you coming?. Caress me! You're awake? - l've been waiting for you. How are you? l'm fine. And? How do you feel? Also good. This time no cut wounds? Very funny. - l was just joking. l'm glad it was nice with Teri. How does she feel? - l believe good. And how is Vincent? - Fine, apparently. Then it hurts no one. As if we're all somehow insensible. lt doesn't matter to you? - At the moment not. Do you still like me? ln the coming weeks continued exchanging partners. The strike goes on. Of course. We felt free. And enjoyed that new life. l accepted no rules. For me there was only one restriction: We met only if we all four had time. Rachel? Euro Star strike, travel cancelled. Want to meet Frank? l've often wondered why we never felt the need to to define the rules of the game. To clarify what was allowed among us four and what was not. Vincent made fun of me. He said we didn't invent a new sports discipline for which the rules and statutes should be specified. Message to all conference participants from England: All connections to London are now cancelled. Sophie, Sophie! Can you take over please? My daughter fell down the stairs. lt's about virtual worlds, l've no idea. Thank you! We took our taboos and desires into consideration. Vincent and l for example agreed to never ask the other one, how we spend the hours with Rachel or Franck. When l came to France l noticed a saleswoman in the bakery beside my school. She was very pretty, still rather young, and had broad shoulders. Not understood. - lt's too early. l fell in love with her. l imagined her and caressed myself. ln Thelma's age? Thelma is in the fifth Class, l was older. l always imagined that l would be in the bakery with her. And that at some point she takes me to the back room, and that l would lick her breasts, between sacks of flour, cream cakes and the snakes. - Snakes? Sure! Those you can eat, licorice snakes. The worst is that he had pushed the effect button. Nonsense, he's far too clever. Believe me, he has pushed it and said... Good night Salimata. Yeah, Teri? TV! Wait! Can you hear it? What is it? - Are you watching the race? Yes, Margot is a fan of it. - Now you guess! How does Franck fall asleep with you? Come on! He snuggles up to me. And with you? That's to close for me, l don't like it. Still, he sometimes pushes an arm under me. Vincent doesn't sleep like that. No. He sleeps on the edge of the bed. To have the feeling of being alone. No, no, no, not that far. What's it? Don't move! Let me do it! Don't worry! - l'll fall down! That was it. Will you get a hard on again now? - That was the intention. What time is it? Already three o'clock. Sorry, l forgot the time. l'll have a shower. Will you help me to carry back the sofa? - Sure. To where it was. Do you have to do it so wild? - What? That wasn't it. l pushed it there by will. Why?. - Well, l'm currently writing a book. Feng Shui for couples. - Are there bad vibrations here? lt's about sexual Feng Shui. - Sexual? For the stamina and to stimulate virility. Has it worked? A little l think, l just wanted to try it out. You used my wife for experiments? - Come on, you know her. l told her about it, and she wanted to try it out. Listen, Franck. l don't ask Teri what you do together. l don't want to know anything. So please leave no traces. Think of it as a broad hint. Salut. Wait, Franck! Wait, wait! Teri and l are going well together. - l know. No, no. Teri and l have good sex. She gets what she needs. l mean, she doesn't sleep with you because she's unsatisfied. l've never thought that. - Okay. Goodbye! - Have a good time, honey. Apologize to the teacher that you are too late. l wish you what, honey. Did you move Teri's furniture yesterday?. Word gets around quick. What happened? - Oh nothing! We fell asleep, nothing special. But since we're at it: How are things going with Vincent? l mean sex. - l haven't talked about sex. Hey, you can tell me. - Tell what? Does he have problems? l don't know if it's wise to talk about it. He has no problems but he's a hard time. l thought we had agreed to avoid the subject? What difficulties does he have? - To come. Aha. And that's not a problem? - No. lt takes a long time? - Yes. Teri says, it's quite different with me. - ls she saying that? That's crazy! With you? What could possibly be different? Tell me, l don't know. She finds you more gentle. Your massages seem to be a great prelude. What do you know about that? Did Vincent say it? l think it came up coincidently. Just so. l know why Franck sees you as a Sudoku. Why?. Because you're not so easy to crack. Your boxes aren't complete. Don't you think that we meet too often? We two? - No, the four of us. Margot! Margot! l don't find it exhilarating. Far too little daylight. The cashier would have to stand here, facing south. Especially in winter. Where is south? Where is south? No idea. l'll say no, Franck. Tim, put on your jacket to, it's cold here. Disappointed? - No, quite the opposite. l feel more liberated. - Should l take pictures? Yes, take pictures for Vincent. Don't you want to be on it? Then he'll get an idea of the sizes. Very good. Further back, still more! Still a bit! Yes! Super! l wonder what they are doing?. - No idea. Teri wanted to show Franck something. Do you know what's going on? Checking out rooms for a Fitness Studio, l think. They are busy and do much walking. Eventually we'll find them choose the wallpaper. Stop thinking about them! What are they talking about? - They're fucking, nothing else is going on. No, they do talk a lot together, says Teri. Sure they talk to each other. l mean, they have proper conversations. Maybe. And about what? - l don't know. l'll phone her now. - No, you'll not do that. What time is it? Around three thirty. l'll go back to the studio, and you? - l'll also return to work. That wasn't good. Now l can't stop thinking of them. l'm sorry. We don't talk more about them, agree? - Yes. Rachel? Are you serious? - Try it on! That makes my butt too. No, something so sporty isn't me. But why not give it to Teri? - She doesn't fancy sportswear. But that's more her style. - What do you mean? She likes this American style; ''l feel comfortable in my clothes, in my body, l like everyone and l'm constantly kissing anybody. You're wrong. l would have noticed that. - What is it then you noticed? First, that she's full of energy and that she's very optimistic. They tries out a lot, dares much. She's simply very open. Yes, she has something of a little scout girl. Nonsense! Wasteful, that's it. - What? Wasteful. - Wasteful? Does she even come anal? Good heavens, what kind of a question is that? Do you know what wasteful means? - Of course. l know it exactly. They slowly get expensive for us. How many?. - Seven. Wait! Take that for Margot! - You've lost a lot of weight. l don't know. - Hey, you must know that. Well, maybe a little. - Stop it, now don't be so shy! You look great! What? - Nothing. Of course, nothing. You're wiggling with your bum... l don't wiggle with my bum! - Do you have a boyfriend? You have a friend! No! - Yes, you made ''Pff''. You've betrayed yourself, my dear. - Now stop that rubbish! Franck shall not hear it, or what? - Franck? - Yes? My sister says that l have a boyfriend! Nonsense! Don't try, you're blushing. Like a tomato! The lost son had to come home, because he lived so lavishly?. Yes. Once there was a man, a wealthy landowner, who had two sons. One day one of them demanded his inheritance, the younger one. He wants to leave his parents' house, travel around and live his own life. The father agrees, and the younger son moves away. Far away, with bag and pack into the unknown. Within the shortest time he uses his entire inheritance, and it's all gone. What did he spent it on? - Well, on whores! Rachel, please! So, in short: ''He is penniless, when suddenly a terrible famine comes. The entire country is affected. He has to look for work. Someone offers him a job as a swineherd. And as he soon finds that his food much worse than that of the pigs. He remembers that his father, when times were very poor, served crumbs to the servants, or whatever remained from their meals. And so he returns to his father who's reaction is amazing. He calls his servants and says: Get the most gorgeous robes and wrap my son into them! The fatted calf must be slaughtered. lt will make a feast. Let's celebrate huge!'' That was it? But no! Meanwhile, the eldest son works in the fields. ln the evening he returns from his work, enters the estate, where there's loud music and singing. He asks a servant: ''What is celebrated?'' The servant replied: ''Your brother is here! And your father had the fatted calf slaughtered to celebrate him. The older son goes to his father and says angrily: Why that? l've always obeyed you, and worked for you, and very hard. And you haven't even given me a buck. But for my brother, who has squandered all your money, you even slaughter the fatted calf! The father looks at his eldest son and says: My child, you and l, we always lived together. But today there's a reason to be happy and celebrate. Because your brother's been dead Now he lives again. He was lost and is found again. A silly story. Why was the son so wasteful? Well, because he had spent the whole fortune. He has wasted the money. Yeah, right, that's nothing positive. This has nothing generous. Wasteful people aren't generous, but irresponsible. Just a moment, it's not that. The tale reveals something entirely different. What's the most wonderful in life? lf someone who has sinned regrets and re-starts. l think that's bullshit. Be glad, then you'll get a place in paradise although you had a lover. Only if she regrets. Of course, who's your Lovers? Do we know him? Enjoy it, my love. When you've squandered everything, then you just come back home. We're not opening a shop anyway. - And why not? Because of the bank. We'll wait until next year. You stay where you are? - Yes, for now. Did you give that to her, or l? lt was me. lt's an amulet. - An amulet. Will you visit us in the weekend? No, l can't, we'll have guests. Rachel, your pocket. Thank you. - Rachel, and you? Doesn't work, we have a lot to do. - You don't need to mow the lawn. You could go on a forest promenade with Margot. No, my book needs to be finished l'll work through. Too bad, we have a great house in the country, and no one uses it. Not next weekend, but the one after next maybe. Take care. Salut! Look at me! Come on, look at me! You shall look at me! She sleeps. - What did you read for her?. Asterix in Britain. - Seriously?. No! Yes, yes! - Pretty daring. Will you explain the comic and the comic terms to her?. Of course. - What does SPQR mean? Senate and People of Rome. Never heard of it? - No. l have look for your black sweater. Where is it? ln the wash. Are you in the mood for caramel icecream? - Do we have some? A rest. Beat me! - What? Beat my cheek! Come on, like this! The cheek? Well, it didn't hurt. - l'm sorry, l'll try again. No, no, leave it! Let's stick to the usual way. Wow, nice eh? Back there the office. And group lessons are held there. With a parquet floor it will look really noble. Teri's appearance in the photo hit me completely off guard. And also that Franck obviously looked ''amorous'' at her. Now l didn't ask myself anymore what Franck liked about Teri, but what he still liked with me. Vincent couldn't say often enough, that he was in the same situation, namely, to be in love with two women, l didn't care. For the first time in my life l suspected Franck to be a man like all the others. We were soon tormented by the simple question: ls it possible to love two persons at the same time? And most important: Should we let it happen? Rachel, what's the matter?. - What's going on? ls anything wrong?. - l don't want the stay over night anymore. What? l don't want us to stay at the other over night anymore. Vincent and l are no couple You two are not a couple. There's no reason to spend the night together. Okay, Rachel, that's no problem. l have nothing against the sex, but l think we need new rules. Well. There have never been rules, that's the point, right? Yeah, right. - Was it necessary to come with it right now? Yes. - Was it so urgent? Yes. l'll make tea. Everyone has their own clothes. That's why l think we shouldn't borrow from the others, even if it feels good. And l don't anymore, that Franck caresses your feet in front of my eyes, like the other night, Teri. l see. l'm sorry that l woke you up. l didn't want to... Don't worry. Let's go home. No, Teri is making tea for us. Pull the keys out of my pocket! Put the heater on, it's cold! Here. - Rachel's coming. Cigarette? - Thank you. Thank you. Everyone does what he can. Careful! Margot? Help Tim with his pocket please. Come on! She'll show you where to go. l've put money for the cinema on the table. Okay, l'll pull out the sofa. - Good. And you'll sleep in the big bed, OK? Take down your backpack! And this is our room. lf you want you can hang up your stuff. Just push everything to the side. There are comics, and books are here. Ah, l have something for you. Here are a lot of old clothes and a few bags. Search it all through. And if you like anything, you can have it and take it home. Oh, something smells! Here! Give me the map, l'll tell you where you drive. What faces they make? l don't hope Matilda gets her friend, as soon we are out of sight. You bet. No idea why l said it. l hope her friend will come. lf l'd be in her place l'd get my friend right away. Thank you. Will that stop soon? - This is just a small shower. Teri? After refuelling. They're very fresh. There are currants. How are they called in English? Blueberry?. No, blueberries are blueberries. currants are redcurrants. Redcurrants. Here, do you want? - l'm not a big fan of berries. There we have two pear trees, an apple tree... Pear-tree. - Pear-tree it's called? Apple-tree. This is a small Fig-tree, which l love very much. Fig-tree. - The poor guy does what he can. A peach tree. The name? - Peach! Peach-tree! Peach-tree. - Peach-tree. They're almost ripe, perhaps you can eat them already. This is a plum tree - Plum Tree. La Reine Claude. - Queen Claude. What's that? - l don't remember. A walnut tree? - No. Nectarine-tree? - Nope. Sure? - Small and firm. Reminds me of eggs. Balls. Like a ball. Ball-tree. - Egg-tree. Ball-tree, even l would have known that. Cold? Hey! lt's so nice here. Rachel! Thank you. Go inside, go! Come on! Can you hear something?. Open the door! What's going on? - Just proceed. Come on! - No! Sure! Yes! - What? What are you afraid of?. - Nothing. Come on! - What's it? You'll see. Go on, it's nothing. Go! Oh no! No, no, no! - Come on! Madness. l surely can't sleep. This is too much. l've always dreamed to experience erotic adventures, as many as possible. But now l feel overwhelmed by you. You have been drinking a lot, smoked a lot and eaten too much. Don't get your morals! Yes, you're right, l've smoked too much. l don't feel good. You're much better than me. So flexible! l'm stiff. You like to laugh, and l'm serious. You are open, l have my secrets. You are light and l weight ten tons. l'm bursting with jealousy. They sleep. - Leave them! l have an ace! Perfect! l go with you, let's see. There you go, twice cross. Colour, colour, colour?. Oh man, the ace of spades. What a bummer! Mama? When's a tsunami, and you you can hold yourself with one hand, who would you save with the other hand? Thelma or me? Do you write the essay?. Look, Mama, the wave destroyed almost the whole Hotel! Thelma, whose mother has abandonment her child? She was in the water, and she held on with one hand. With the other hand she only reached one child. She grabbed the smaller one because she thought the older one could swim alone. See? Listen carefully, Thelma! And you too, Tim! Your mother is strong! Okay?. No other mother is strong like me! Tim, what did l do when l was 15? You were second best! - Right! Second best in Europe! l'll do the following: l'll grab Thelma and say to her: Hang on, Thelma! And then l would grab you too and press you really hard against me. Then l'd still have a hand free to tickle you a little. That's mine. - Yours? What is it? None of your business. - And why not, darling?. Because it's my diary. - Oh, sorry. And the book? Where did you get that? Now don't make such a face. From Rachel. Tim, please go to your room. What's that? ls that Rachel's? Did you steal it when you slept over there? What do you want with it? Did you read it? Thelma, answer me, what exactly did you read? Nothing. l give a shit what you do. Lights out? - Two minutes. You know, l think you turn back towards me, because you want to think about her when you sleep in. Damn. What is it? Franck shall stop to massage with this oil. The bedding stinks always coconut. And me too. Constantly we must change the sheets. We have a washing machine, what's the problem? Does he do it by purpose? - Okay. l'll tell Rachel and Franck that l'm out, then you'll have a clean bed. Well, l agree. That's maybe best. Let's face it, Rachel is right, it can't continue. That's what she said? l've the feeling that we only talk about the two. At least an hour every day l don't want to think about them. They can't help it. l may step out if l want, right? Leave it as it is. l beg you. Sometimes l think, to be alive means to be together with Vincent. Because the emotions are so strong. Because otherwise, l can't live my dreams. Because he makes my hands get wet and opens my eyes. Because he makes a smile magically appear on my lips. Because his makes me melt away. You have a beautiful smile. That one was too high! Attention! Oh crap, l thought this would be super ball, but it was nothing. lf we had met when you were 20, do you think you would have fallen in love with me? And wanted to be with me? l don't know. And would you have wanted children with me? Hey, pay attention, watch out! Caution! Who's that? My father, l've no idea what he wants. Listen, you two! l need to go to the slaughter, with whom will you go? We'll go with you. You can also preheat the grill. No. Shopping is boring. And you? - l'll join you! Leave them alone. - Of course, yes. Better listen to your mailbox perhaps it's important. That annoys me. - Give it to me, what shall l deal? Tell me, kids, would you like to go to our country home? How would that be? You both and Margot? - Today?. No, not today. ln the weekend. Yeah, Teri? When did it happen? Are you going there right now? Of course. - Thelma? No, no, we'll prepare everything after shopping, don't worry. Tell Franck, he shall call me when you are there. What's going on? Franck's mother fell in the bath. l'm coming down, l've to unlock the door for you. The door lock is broken. - ls Obriot already here? No, not yet. - Teri, a friend. Oh yes, Teri. - No, no, you don't know. Why did she climb up? That's what l wanted to do. You're funny. lt just dripped continuously. l left you three messages. She sleeping. lsn't that dangerous after a fall? Mom! Mom! Monsieur. - lt's me. Franck. How are you? My knee hurts so much, doctor. l'm not the doctor. lt's me, Frank. A fall can cause short-term memory loss, Obriot told me on the phone. She thinks l'm the doctor. That has nothing to do with the short-term memory. You fell when you wanted to repair the shower. Do you remember?. l am thirsty. - She is thirsty. Franck is wrong, l know her so much. When Frank was here, you called him a few times. Maybe. l think l've caught a cold. Everything okay?. What are you drinking?. - Nothing, l don't have much time. Have you ever wondered what would have happened if you'd met Vincent first or l Franck first? Be honest, you've you never asked? l've no idea, no. l do. What's next? Well, then Tim and Thelma wouldn't exist nor would Margot. That's right, yes. Thelma asked me give it back. Don't blame her, please. Does Franck also know it? l have read it all, you should know that. Franck, we've something to talk about. - Just a second. No. Please come immediately. What's the matter?. l met Vincent for the first time in our atelier. Actually, Diane, and he should discuss the website, but she wanted to leave. So l stayed. And two days later he came once more to ask whether the changes were okay. l knew it was because of me. He could have called me. We went for a drink in the bar next door, and when he asked me if he might kiss me, l said: Yes. Two days later we met in a hotel, and slept together. lt was just this one time. Why?. - Why what? Why only once? - l stopped it. Didn't you want any more? Honestly, l did not have the strength to lie for you. Here is a letter in which l apologize. Franck? Oh damn, l don't want to meet them, have you called them? And coffee? - Yes, please. Thank you. - Teri? Not look at me, l can't do it then. Vincent, please look out there. Because nobody has the courage, l'll say what everyone wants, but at doesn't dare to say. lt's definitely over, that was it. Rachel! Only because you move the furniture, you'll not feel less guilty. This is not Feng Shui, l'll just throw out the carpet with Teri's blood on. - You can't run away. Sooner or later you'll have to talk with us. l'm ready. Yes, l've with Vincent before our agreement, so we had sex one time more, that makes no big difference. lt does make a huge difference. l don't want that everyone is disappointed now. Too late. - Stop it, Frank, what's this? l know that you and Teri meet secretly. Now it gets ugly. Vincent, it was your suggestion that we meet. Was that serious meant? l don't know, yes. - No, that's not true. What are you talking about? - l'll explain. When they separated Vincent said to Rachel: lf we two fall in love, they could continue to meet. That was just a joke! - Or a premonition. Stop talking such nonsense. Teri, look at me. Teri! Vincent just said it without thinking. Can you throw the bowl in my face because l slept with Vincent without When Diane cancelled because she didn't want to leave her sick friend alone, was it arranged? - No, what's the point now? We will not make everything evil only because it's over now, right? l've no more ideas. ls it over?. You have said when it started, now will you want to determine when it's over. Everything goes according to your rules. l never said that l want to stop, Rachel said that. She doesn't want to stop, nor to give explanations. l want that it's over between us. And why?. For the first time in my life l feel exhausted. You've just caught a cold, which is no reason to say it must be over. You don't understand what it is about actually. Before l met you, l was never tired. l only want to forget you now. We'll go home and never meet again. Come on. Vincent, please. Vincent. l can't do it alone. Help me please. Vincent, l beg you. Stop staring at him. Vincent. Come on, you've been here long enough. What? Do you want to spend all holidays in the next year without us? The same evening l called Rachel. How shall that go? l had to cry before l even said a word. Rachel was also weeping. l don't know if l can endure this. l said that l couldn't imagine not see them anymore. Both of you. May l call at least? Only talk once in while. May l send you an email? l said to her: With you we are a better ''we''. Rachel told me that the idea that we won't meet anymore, made her also afraid. ln between she wished to die. l'll control myself and l won't get aggressive. We never met the two again. Franck and l started to meet our friends from the past again. One day, Romain, who loves games, asked what up to date had been the most beautiful in our life. We answered in turn. For Noemi it was the first smile of her daughter. For Diane an Egyptian diadem which was exhibited in the Louvre. For Nora, it was a picture by Hieronymus Bosch. When we heard these answers, Franck and l just looked at each other. Franck hastened say: The Bay of Hong Kong. l replied: Margot's birth. l was sure that Frank had lied. l had also lied. Margot birth was only the second. A few weeks later my father died unexpected. During the preparations for the funeral l felt surprisingly something like joy. l hoped actually that Teri and Vincent would come to the funeral. They didn't come. At the funeral l was haunted by my wistful memories. l didn't remember my childhood then, but was full of longing for my recent past. l've never got rid of it. This desire for ecstasy and invincibility. For the emotions that l perceived in the adventure. The adventure with Franck, Vincent and Teri.
