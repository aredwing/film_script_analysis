Tomorrow, Walden, Widget, and I are getting our picture taken. We do it every year. Yes, yes, yes. Here's my collection of all the photos we've taken over the years. This is last year, and the year before. Wubbzy, you always have the most interesting outfits. [laughs] That's for sure. I can't wait to see what you're gonna wear this year, little buddy. Yes, yes, yes. I'll bet it's something special. You'll see. Dum dee dum dum Dee dee dum dum dum [gargles] Lookin' good. Wee! Wow, a puddle. It must have rained last night. [splash] Hmm. [splash] Woo-hoo! I love puddles. Wubbzy? What are you doing? We're supposed to get our picture taken today. Oh, right. I guess I need another bath. [humming] Now I have to find something else that's cool to wear. Yes! Sorry, I can't play with you this time, Mr. Puddle. Wow, wow, guys. What are you doing? Hi, Wubbzy. We're playing puddle jump. It's lots of fun. Watch. Made it. Me, too. My turn. Whoa. Whoa! Hooray! Come on, Wubbzy. You try it. Okay. I did it. Yay! Uh-oh. I'm gonna make it this time for sure. There's no way I'll get dirty, now. I'll make it for sure, this time. [wind gusts] Hey, the wind stopped blowing. [splash] Hey, whatcha doing there, little buddy? We're supposed to get our picture taken, today. I was all ready. But then I got all muddy again. I guess I better start all over. Well, it's spiffy, anyway. [gasps] Ta-da! Wow. What's that, Widget? It's my new invention. The Puddle Bubble 3000. It'll protect you from falling into anymore puddles. Really? Wow. This is cool. Yeah, and watch this, little buddy. Hey. [chuckles] See? The mud bounces right off. Now you can't possibly get muddy. Wow, wow. Thanks, Widget. No problemo. I'll meet you over at the photographer's studio. [squeaking] Wow. Wow, wow. Wow, wow, wow. That's kooky. [laughs] What a great invention. Uh-oh. Whoa! Whoa! [sighs] This time, I'm not even going to get close to a puddle. Taxi. Now I know for sure I won't get my clothes dirty. [laughs] Wow. Oh, boy. I love honey. [brakes squeak] I made it without a spot of mud. Come on, Wubbzy. We're waiting to take the picture. I'll be right in. [Woman] Help! What's that? Oh, help. Help! Help! What's the matter, Mrs. Zamboni? Oh, Wubbzy. My pet, Polly Parrot, escaped from his cage. And now he's up in that tree. [squawks] Could you please catch him for me? Um... okay. Here, Polly, Polly, Polly. Got ya. [squawks] No. He's got me. [screams] [groans] My, that was easy. Thank you, Wubbzy. [sighs] Thanks, Widget. I'm sorry, Walden. I tried to stay clean for the picture. I really did. But I got all muddy, anyway. That's okay, Wubbzy. You were helping somebody. And that's always more important than keeping clean. It is? Sure thing, little buddy. Besides, I knew you'd look special today, somehow. Well, well, well. Let's take that picture now. Shall we? Oh, I can't take a picture with you guys. You're all dressed up, and I'm a mess. We can fix that. Can't we, Widget? You betcha. Yippy! Yee-haw! Wait for me! [laughing] Okay, say "cheesy cheese." [all] Cheesy cheese! [shutter clicks] That was picture perfect. [all laugh] When you're lonely, friends are there When you're empty, friends will share When you're feeling sad, they really care 'Cause that's what friends are for That's what friends are for That's what friends are for When you really need them, they'll be there Yeah, that's what friends are for When there's a book that you just can't read If there's something special that you really need You don't have to beg and plead 'Cause that's what friends are for That's what friends are for That's what friends are for When you really need them, they'll be there Yeah, that's what friends are for When you've got a new toy, and you wanna play That's what friends are for When you're really bored on a rainy day That's what friends are for If you wanna dance but you've got no beat If you're hungry, and you wanna eat Just call your friends and you can meet 'Cause that's what friends are for That's what friends are for That's what friends are for When you really need them, they'll be there When you really need them, they'll be there When you need them, they will be there Yeah, that's what friends are for Wow, that was fun. What do you wanna do now? Hey, let's go get some doodleberry pie. Ooh, I love doodleberry pie. Come on, let's go-- Oh! Are you okay, Wubbzy? Who's Wubbzy? Uh, you're Wubbzy. Well, who are you guys? We're Widget and Walden. Oh, uh-- I was told to never talk to strangers. We're not strangers. We're your best friends. Yes, yes, yes. We were gonna get some doodleberry pie. What's doodleberry pie? Jeepers. He doesn't remember anything. [moos] And he's mooing like a cow. Something must've happened to Wubbzy when he fell on his head. We better take him to see Dr. Flooey right away. [moos] Don't you worry, Wubbzy. I'm sure that Dr. Flooey will be able to get your memory back. Oh, good. Where is he? Uh, he's right next to you, little buddy. Gee, I don't remember-- [moos]. I mean, I don't remember you at all. But Wubbzy, you were just in here last week when you hurt your tail. I hurt my tail? That's right Wubbster. Remember? We were all playing with your flippity flip together. Wa-hoo! Here comes the flippity flip, Walden. Well thrown, Widget. Heads up, Wubbzy. Got ya. [giggles] Okay, catch this one, Widget. Wow. I think you over-flipped it that time, Wubbzy. [groaning] Oh, pickles and prune juice. I can't reach it. Don't worry. I'll bounce up there on my tail and grab it. One, two, [plop] Hey. What's the matter? [plop] There's no spring left in my tail. Gee, little buddy. That's not good. We'd better bring you over to Dr. Flooey right away. Hmm, hmm, hmm. Uh-huh. Yes, just what I thought. Wubbzy, you've got a tired tail. A tired tail? No doubt about it. See how red your tail is? Yes indeed, you need to rest it for a couple of days. Couple of days? But the big doodleberry bake-off is today. I'm afraid you'll have to skip the bake-off. What about Moo-Moo's new magic show? No can do. I can't miss the big kickity-kick ball game. They need me. Sorry, but if you want your tired tail to get better, you have to rest. Now you go home and stay off that tail. [sighs] [trumpet plays] Wow. It must be time for the doodleberry bake-off. Gee, and I had such a great recipe for doodleberry pie. I would have won easy, if it wasn't for this tail. You know, it doesn't feel as bad as before. And it's not as red as it was before. It's getting better. It's probably safe to go to the bake-off. As long as I'm really careful. Future bakers of Wuzzleburg, are you ready to begin? [all cheer] All ready, Chef Ritz. Wubbzy, what are you doing here? Yeah, you're supposed to be resting your tail. Oh, I feel much better now. Okay, start baking. [ringing] Wow, it's a lot harder to stir when you're not using your tail. Oh, you wanna borrow my Blenderoo 3000, little buddy? It'll mix anything. Thanks, Widget. Now, how do you work this thing? Here we go. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ouchie. My tail. Jeepers. It's even redder than before. We'd better take you back home. There. Now, if you're all comfy-cozy, Wubbster, we gotta scadaddle. Yes, yes, yes. We don't wanna be late for Moo-Moo's magic show. Moo-Moo. He's my favorite magician ever. I'm coming with you. I don't think that's a good idea, Wubbzy. How can I hurt my tail just sitting in the audience? Oh, I don't know, little buddy. But Dr. Flooey said you need to rest that tail. Don't worry. I'll be careful. [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the Great Moo-Moo. Abracadabra. Voila. [cheering] And now, my friends, we'll play a little game called "Where's Wiggles?" Who would like to assist me? I will! I will! Be careful, Wubbzy. In you go, Wiggles. Now, keep your eye on the hats. Where's Wiggles? Where's Wiggles? She's in that one. No, that one. No, that one. Look out, Wubbzy! No, she's definitely in that one. Whoa, oh, ah! Ohh. Oh, Wubbzy. I believe your tail is even redder than before. Yep, back to the couch, little buddy. Aw. What am I gonna do about the kickity-kick ball game? My team needs me. But you can't afford to hurt your tail again. Hmm. I have an idea. Ta-da! The Bubble Ball 3000. This here'll protect your tail, so you can play without worrying. Thanks, Widget. It's great. [chirps] Are you sure you can play with that bubble on your tail? Just watch me. Hooray! Great shot, Wubbzy. Hey, Widget, this thing really works. Hi, birdie-bird. What do you think of my bubble ball? [chirps] [pop] Whoa. Ahh! Ohh. That wasn't supposed to happen. Oh. Wow, my tail is totally red. You should've listened to Dr. Flooey, Wubbzy. Now you have to rest your tail even longer. But it's no fun staying indoors. I could never have a bake-off, or a magic show, or a really fun game in here. Why not? We can do anything we want if we put our minds to it. And now it's time to judge the Wubbzy bake-off. The entries are... Widget's peppermint popovers, Wubbzy's doodleberry pie, and my own famous mustard custard. And now for the best part. I'd say we're all winners. And now, the tablecloth will magically float up, up, and away. Oops, that wasn't supposed to happen. [both laugh] Bravo. Bravo! Three, three, give me a three. Yes! 1, 2, 3. I win. You know, you guys are right. You can have lots of fun at home. All the redness has gone. Very healthy angle. And look at that spring. Yes, indeed. Your tail is as good as new, Wubbzy. Wow! Wow! Wow! It works. [boing, boing, boing] Hey, look. That flippity flip is still stuck. But not for long. Gotcha. Nice going, little buddy. Now we can finish that game of flippity flip. Ready? Here it comes. I got it! I got it! [both] Oomph! Are you guys all right? Ah, I think I have a tired elbow. I think I have a tired head. Wow, you better go home and get plenty of rest. [all laugh] So, do you remember Dr. Flooey now, Wubbzy? Hmm...nope. Yep, I believe that Wubbzy has a case of knockity-noggin. What's that? It's when you bonk your head and you lose all of your memories. [moos] And you start mooing like a cow. Jeepers, what can we do? Well, about the only thing you can do is try to share some past memories with Wubbzy and hope he starts remembering things. Yes, yes, yes. I have just the thing. Okay Wubbzy, this scrapbook has lots of photos of all the great times we've had together. Perhaps looking at them will help bring back your memory. Do you remember when we went camping? No. Do you remember when we went to Dino Island? No. How 'bout when we went in search of pirate treasure? Hmm. Maybe. Did we have a treasure map? Yes, yes, yes. You found it inside the pirate book that you were reading. Hey, what's that? Very interesting. It appears to be a map of Wuzzleburg. Yes, sirey. There's Wuzzleburg Park. And there's the pond. [gasps] And there's the island. Hmm. I wonder what this 'X' stands for. An 'X'? Wow, wow, wow. This must be a treasure map. A treasure map? Sure, it fell out of the pirate book, didn't it? An 'X' marks the spot where pirates always hide their treasure. Wow, wow, wow! Treasure! We have to go find it, right now. Uh, I don't wanna disappoint you, Wubbzy, but there are no pirates in Wuzzleburg. And there probably isn't any treasure, either. Sure there is. You just have to believe. Wait. If we're going to find the pirates' treasure, then we need to look like pirates. Arg. [laughs] Follow me! There you go. Now you be Captain Nobeard Walden. Say "Arg!" Arg. And you be Hammerhand Widget. I be? And I be... I be... I be Longtail Wubbzy. Arg! Now all I need is a parrot to be my best friend. Hi, birdie-bird. Wanna be my parrot? Polly want a cracker? [squawks] [belches] That means "yes" in parrot. Okay, then, mateys. Let's heave-ho! Arg! Arg. Arg. So first, we have to follow the map across the park. Boy, I wonder what the treasure is. Maybe it's gold. You know, Wubbzy-- Longtail Wubbzy. Longtail Wubbzy, there may not be any treasure. Oh, sure there is. You just have to believe. According to the map, we need to cross the pond to get to the island. That's gonna be hard to do without a boat. Hey, there's a boat. Yes, yes, yes. But it's rather beat up. Maybe Hammerhand Widget can fix it. No problemo. I always carry my Handy Dandy 3000. Only today, we'll call it the Pirate Pal 3000. Arg! Stand back. [beeps] [sawing, hammering] Wow. We've got a real pirate ship. Let's go get that treasure. [chirping] There may not be any treasure, Longtail Wubbzy. Oh, sure there is. You just have to believe. Here we go. Across the bounding main. Sailing the seven seas. Uh, Wubbzy? We're not moving. Shiver me timbers, you're right, Captain Nobeard. We don't have a sail. And there aren't any oars to row with. Wait, I have an idea. [splash] Huh-ho! They don't call me Longtail Wubbzy for nothing. Uh-oh. Everybody hit the deck! [croaking] Wow, wow. Flying speckled frogs. Boy, I wish I had my net. Rocky-rocks, dead ahead. Whoa! That was close. [all] Phew. Look. Wow! [gasps] Land ho! [laughter] Yo, ho, ho! It's time to claim our treasure. [both] There may not be any treasure, Longtail Wubbzy. Oh, sure there is. You just have to believe. Wow, look at these pretty rocks. [snapping] They're not rocks. They're snappity-snap turtles. Yikes! Double yikes! Great blasted barnacles. If only we had some crackers to feed them. We do. Here you go, Mr. Snappity-Snap. [crunching] It works. [turtles belch] We made it. [both] Phew. And now all we have to do is follow this path to the 'X' and we'll find the treasure. Wubbzy, there is no 'X'. And there is no treasure. But you have to believe. You can believe if you want... [both] But we give up. [both gasp] Shiver me timbers. [Walden] There really is an 'X'. See, I told you. Well, blow me down. It's a crew of salty dogs. Ahoy, mateys. [all] Ahoy! Are you a real pirate? You bet your pirate's booty. I be Captain Sweet Tooth Tom. Ah, I see you found me treasure map. Your map? Aye, I drew it up me-self. So, what's the treasure, Captain Sweet Tooth? Is it gold? Arg. It's right here. Huh? The treasure was the adventure you had today. Was it fun, me hardies? Really fun. Yes, yes, yes. It was great. We should've believed you, Wubbzy. There are pirates in Wuzzleburg. And there was a treasure. The best kind of treasure, an adventure. Thanks, Captain Sweet Tooth. You're welcome, laddie. Oh, but I wouldn't be called Sweet Tooth Tom if I didn't have a treat for you as well. One piece each, and make sure you brush when you get home. [all] Thanks. All righty, laddies, suppose you take me back across the pond, so I can hide me map again and another group of pirates can find it. Sure thing. Let me just fetch me library card. I must confess, this day has been a great treasure. Yeah, having fun is way better than gold, or silver, or jewels. And a lot easier to carry home. Arg. [laughter] And that was our pirate adventure, Wubbzy. Do you remember that, little buddy? No. But it sure was a cool story. [moos] Hmm. Do you remember when you and Widget were spies? Maybe. Well, it all started when you and Widget came to visit me one day. I wonder what Walden's up to. I dunno, Widget. But I haven't seen him all day. Uh, hi, Wubbzy. Hi, Widget. Wow, wow, Walden. Whatcha doing? Oh, I'm a-- I was, um-- That is to say-- We're on our way to play some kickity-kick ball. Do you wanna join us? Well, I would, but I, um-- I'm busy. See ya later. Wow. I think Walden's keeping a secret. A secret. Let's ask him what it is. Wubbster, if it's a secret, he won't tell us what it is. Oh. You're right. If only there was a way we could find out. I know! I know! We can spy on him. Eh, I don't know, little buddy. I don't think it's right to spy on other people. But if we don't spy on Walden, we'll never know his secret. Yeah, I guess you're right. Yay! Now let's get to spying. [chirping] Wow, I look like a real spy. Yeah, check it out. I brought some spy equipment. Wow, Widget. That's a lot of spy stuff. And that's not all. [beep] It's my Spymobile 3000. We can spot any clues with this baby. Wow, wow, wow. Now all we need are special spy names. I know, I'll be Noodle and you can be Doodle. How come I have to be Doodle? I wanna be Noodle. Please? Okay. You can be Noodle. Aw, thanks, Doodle. Now, let's start spying. [beeping] This periscope doesn't reach high enough. No problemo, little buddy. My spy shoes'll give you a lift. [beep] Walden's packing a suitcase. He must be going somewhere. Let's go higher, so I can get a better look. [beep] Whoa! Whoa! That wasn't supposed to happen. [humming] Walden's on the move. [humming] Follow that Walden! We'll disguise the Spymobile, so Walden will never know we're following him. Good idea. [beep] [whistling] That's kooky. He's going into the library. Come on, Doodle. I'm Noodle. Whatever. Let's go. You start looking over there, and I'll start looking over here. Roger. No, I'm Noodle. No, you're Doodle. Whatever. He's not here. He's not here, either. Wait, I hear something. [Widget over walkie] Can you see anything? I just have to move one more book... [both screaming] [humming] There he goes! Let's get a closer look at that book. [Widget] Ooh, it looks like a book about mountains. Mountains? Hmm... This calls for a disguise. I'll put on a costume so Walden won't recognize me. Great idea. Hello, this is Noodle. [Widget] No, you're Doodle! Whatever. Walden is buying some jelly bean soup, cheese wuzzle burgers, marshmallow lasagna, doodleberry pie! [stomach growls] Wow, I'm getting hungry. What a cute little bird. Oh, no! Ze tubie tube pasta is everywhere! Wubbzy, you must clean this up. I'm not Wubbzy. I'm Doodle. Whatever. We need a cleanup in aisle five. Ten-four, little buddy! Let's see. He packed a suitcase, he has a book about mountains, he took lots of food-- And he's driving away in his all-over rover. To the spy-mobile! Follow that rover! No problemo. It's time for the Cloud-Copter 3000. [whirring] [tires screeching] [springing] I can't see. We can get a better view from up there. Hold on to your hat! That must be the secret. He's moving up here to Mt. Zubba Bubba. But what does he need that telescope for? Great horned owl! What are you two doing up there? Um, well, uh, well, we-- I thought, well-- [cracking, screaming] We know all about your secret, Walden. My secret? Yeah, you're moving away without even telling us. That's not my secret. It's not? No, no, no. Tonight is the night of the purple moon. [both] Huh? When there's a purple moon, it's the best time to watch shooting stars, and according to this book, the best place to watch is the top of Mt. Zubba Bubba. I brought my telescope so we could see the stars better. But it's still daylight out. Well, I wanted to get here early to set up a special picnic for you. Ooh, for us? Yes, that was my secret. I wanted to surprise you. Now we can all watch the shooting stars together. We're sorry, Walden. When you wouldn't tell us what you were up to, we spied on you. Yeah, we followed you all over town. Yes, yes, yes. I know. You know? Ha, that was a cute bird suit, "Noodle." I'm Doodle. Whatever. [laughing] Come in, Noodle. [Widget] Noodle here, Doodle. Where are you, Widget? You're missing the whole show. Aw, don't you worry, little buddy. I've got a great view right here. Ah, yes. Watching those shooting stars sure was a lot of fun. Do you remember that, little buddy? No, but it sounds really great. [mooing] My, my, my! Wubbzy still doesn't have his memory back. Don't worry, I can fix this no problemo. Whatcha doing? I'm building a machine that'll help you get your memory back. [beeping] What does this one do? [mooing] This is the Tail-o-Tronic 3000. Don't you remember? I built this for you when you wanted to change your bendy tail. You wanna play with my kickity-kick ball? Your tail is kooky. But look, I've got a really cool ball. It's all long and bendy. And kooky. Does that mean that you don't wanna play? You wanna play with my kickity-kick ball? Whoa! That is one wacky-looking tail. Wow. Everyone thinks my tail is wacky. And kooky. Gee. I gotta do something about this. With a little tape and a few leaves, no one will even notice my tail. You wanna play with my kickity-kick ball? What is that? Oh, this? It's just a normal, everyday tree branch. That's not a normal, everyday tree branch. It's a long, bendy tail. And it's totally kooky. I think it's more wacky than kooky. Well, whatever it is, we're outta here. Hey, maybe Widget will wanna play. Wow, wow, Widget. Wanna play with my kickity-kick ball? Oh, no can do, partner. I am putting the finishing touches on my latest invention. [chuckles] Ta-da! The Robo-Cluck 3000. It's a robotic chicken that lays over 100 eggs a minute. Now, all I need to do is use this wiggle wrench to tighten the thruster bolt, and this baby will be done. What's all this stuff? Oh, oh, be careful. Those are the controls for the robot. Don't worry, I won't touch a thing. [sirens wailing] [gasps] [clucking] Ooh, that's not supposed to happen. That's not supposed to happen, either. [clucking] [sighs] I'm sorry, Widget. My kooky tail is messing everything up. Hey, Widget. You've got lots of tools. Can you fix my tail for me? Oh, no problemo, little buddy. I can fix anything. [clucking] Anything except robot chickens. There we go. The Tail-o-Tronic 3000. This little puppy'll fix your tail in no time. [gasps] Too curly! Oopsy-daisy. Let's try that again. [chuckles] Too balloony. Hmm, maybe if I adjust the sprickle sprocket... Ha, there we go. That oughta do the trick. Too funky! Oh, don't worry, pal. I can fix that. [clucking] We'd better go see Walden. Hmm, I wonder if this belongs to the Stinkadon or the Geckosaurus Rex. [Widget] Hidi-ho, Walden! The Wubbster here, he's got a bit of a problem. Ooh, yes, yes, yes. Oh, I love problems. Is it a math problem? No. Is it a science problem? No. How about geophysical psychology in relation to global economics? Uh, I don't think so. It's his here tail that's the problem. Hmm, it's long and it's bendy. But I don't see the problem. That is the problem! It's long and bendy! And no one will play with me because I have a kooky tail. No, no, no! Being kooky isn't a problem. Look at all those fish. They're all kooky. Wow. [Walden] This fish is big and puffy, while this fish is really small and fast. And this one, this one here is electric. And look at all these animals. [quacking] They're all kooky, too. The stretchalope has a long neck to reach up into the trees, while the tiny honker scurries along the ground. [honking] He's funny. [laughing] And look over here. These two dinosaurs are very kooky. Yes, siree. This guy has big, pointy teeth. And this one here, he has a spiky tail and wings. But I don't have any of those things. The only thing I have is this kooky tail. [clucking] Oh, no, we have to stop that thing before it destroys my dino bones! No problemo, pal o' mine. All I have to do is adjust the thruster bolt with my wiggle wrench and we got ourselves a-- Oops! Big problemo! I must have left my wiggle wrench back at the workshop. Hmm, now let's see... Where can I find something long and bendy to tighten that bolt? Maybe I could use my tail. But Wubbzy, how will you get all the way up there? I can use my tail to bounce up onto the robot. Which one is the thruster bolt? It's the red one, Wubbster! [Widget] Oh, wait a minute. Maybe it's the blue one. No, no, no, no! It was the red one. I think. [grunts] Oh, well. I'll just tighten them both. [clucking] Ha ha! Good job, little buddy. You stopped that crazy robot. [weak clucking] [laughing] Right, and you saved the dinosaurs. All by using your tail. Wow! Maybe having a bendy tail isn't so bad after all. Look how high I can swing! I can swing even higher! [both] Wow! [all] Wow! Look how far I can jump. Look how far I can jump. Whoa! Wow! Can we play kickity-kick ball with you? Sure. Let's do it! Hey, wait for me! And my cool tail! Gee, I don't know why I would wanna change my tail. But I do like this rainbow hair. All righty, then. Presenting the Remember-When 3000. This little baby'll put memories back into your head so that you can remember who you are. Are you ready, little buddy? [moos] I'll take that as a yes. [buzzing] [Widget] We'll start with your birthday. How's the birthday party coming along? Super. I painted a whole stack of invitations. And I cut out this here sign with my ziggity-zig scissors. [Walden] Happy birthday Wubbzy. Nice, nice, nice. And the party hats? Yeah, we made 'em ourselves. Those are great! What about the marshmallow lasagna? Marshmallow lasagna? Of course. It's the perfecto birthday dish. But marshmallows aren't in season, Walden. Maybe we could have jelly bean lasagna instead. Oh, no. I'm gonna make you a giant tray of fresh marshmallow lasagna. It's the nicest thing I can do for you on your special day. Don't start the party until I get back. I can make the lasagna right here in the wagon to save time. Now, it's off to the supermarket. Hi, Earl. Will you come to my birthday party? A party? I'll be there! Wee! Hi, Huggy. Will you come to my birthday party? You bet! Nice invitations, Wubbzy. Thanks, Huggy. Hi, Buggy. Will you come to my birthday party? Will there be cake? Yup. Awesome. See you all there! Noodles, cheese, chocolate chips. And now, to the marshmallow aisle. [humming] [gasps] Galloping gigahertz! Where are all the marshmallows? I'm sorry, sir, but marshmallows are out of season. [sighs] Think, think, think. I know! I'll go straight to the marshmallow factory! It's party time! [all] Yippee! No, no, no. Not yet. We promised Walden we wouldn't start the party without him. Oh, yeah, I forgot. Okay, let's wait for Walden. [groaning] Ah, the marshmallow factory! Closed for the season? Oh, no! Now what? Think, think, think! I know! I can go to the marshmallow forest on top of Mt. Zubba Bubba. It's a long drive, but it'll be worth it for the perfecto party. [yawning] [snoring] Are you having any fun yet? I don't think the party's started. Ooh. Boy, oh, boy. So far, this party is one big flopperoo. Maybe I can fix that. Hey, I haven't made my birthday cake yet. Who wants to help me? I'm a good mixer. I'm a good pourer. I'm a good taster. [cheering] No, no, no. Too hard. No, no, no. Too soft. I can only use marshmallows that are perfecto. [all] Hooray! [both] Mmm. So delicious. So yummy. Hold on, gang! We're supposed to wait for Walden! Right, Widget? [mumbling, chewing] Mm-hmm. That should do it. Oh, my, my! I'm late for Wubbzy's birthday party! [engine stalls] Uh-oh. I think this mountain was too big for my carbunkle. The mountain! I have an idea! I can ride the wagon down the hill. Off to the birthday party! Now we're moving! Time to make the marshmallow lasagna. Pour in one bottle of chocolate sauce... ...and two cups of chocolate chips. [horn honking] Lay the noodles flat... [humming] And now, the cheese. Oh! Kooky. Stir the marshmallows slowly, slowly... Hmm. We need to add water. Perfecto! This has been the best birthday party ever. Sure was, Wubbzy. I had a great time. Loved your cake. I'm sorry we didn't have any marshmallow lasagna. [horn honking] [brakes screeching] Ah, it's finished. Huh? [gasps] Uh-oh! [screaming] [screams] Happy birthday, Wubbzy. Walden! Oh, I guess I'm late. I'm sorry I ruined your party, Wubbzy. You didn't ruin it, Walden. Everybody had a great time. Yeah? Without the marshmallow lasagna? Sure. All you really need for a perfecto party is friends. Hmm. I guess you're right. But, you know what makes this party super-perfecto? A great friend with a big heart who brings a really fabulicious marshmallow lasagna. You can't have a birthday without it. Who wants a piece? [both] Me! Me! I do! I do! [moaning] Not me. [groans] [laughing] Mmm. Mmm. Well? What do you think of my marshmallow lasagna? I think it's per-fecto! I think I'm allergic to marshmallows. [laughing] So? Did you get your memory back? [moos] I'll take that as a no. Ooh. Let's try again! Ooh. That's not supposed to happen. Oh! I'm scared! Oh, you've been more scared than this, Wubbzy. Remember when you stayed up late watching scary movies? [cackling on TV] [quivering] Wow! [cackling] [crashing] [screams] [TV host] You've been watching Mad Marvin's Monster Movie Madness. Tonight, we saw The Bug-Eyed Bug From Buggy Bog. Followed by The Plop From Planet Pooptron. And finally Dude, Where's My Head? Whoa! [Monster Marvin] Tune in next week for The Zany Zombie From Zanzibar. Good night! [laughing] Wow, I love Mad Marvin's Monster Movie Madness. [yawning] Time for bed. [owl hooting] [gasping, trembling] It's okay, Wubbzy. Monsters aren't real. Right? [door creaking] [trembling] [yawning] [howling] Wow, wow, wow. I'm staying up all night. No monster's gonna get me. [rooster crowing] [ringing] [yawning] Wee. [yawning] Huh? Wow. I have to get some sleep tonight. I need some help. The monsters hide in the dark waiting for you to fall asleep... and then they get you! [gulp] Really? Nobody's gonna get you, Wubbzy. There's no such thing as monsters. Right, Widget? Uh... Yeah, of course. But, uh, just to be sure, I know just the thing to keep any monsters away. You do? Thank you. [fake laughter] [drilling] There, that should do it. Wow! The Monster-Masher 3000 is guaranteed to keep your house monster-free. How does it work, Widget? Ha-ho, let me show ya. Once you turn it on, it'll swat any monsters that come near your bed. Danger, danger, danger, danger. Monster alert, monster alert. Monster alert. You must leave immediately. Final warning. Yes! Monster's a no-no! Sweet dreams, Wubbster. Uh, Widget. Huh? Could you stay here tonight? Please? No problemo, little buddy. I'll sleep downstairs on the couch. Great, thanks. Good night, Monster-Masher 3000. Good night, Wubbzy. Sleep tight. [snoring] [buzzing] Danger! Danger! Danger, danger, danger, danger! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Danger! Danger! Oh, no! There's a monster in my room! Widget! [screaming] Wubbzy? I'm a-comin', little buddy! [gasps] [buzzing] Danger! Monster alert! Monster alert! Help! Whoa! [gasps] Danger! Danger! Danger! Danger! Do something, Widget! [powering down] Now let's get out of here! But there's nothing here, Wubbzy. The Monster Masher 3000 must have gone off by accident. [screaming] [both] Monster! [gasping] It's the headless dude! [screaming] The plop from planet Pooptron! [screaming] [gasps] The bug-eyed bug from Buggy Bog! [screaming] [panting] [screaming] Walden! Help! [gasping] The zany zombie from Zanzibar! It's me. I was just baking some cookies before bed. This is no time for baking! Why? What's wrong? There are monsters everywhere! Monsters? Really? Well, maybe those monsters will enjoy some fresh cookies. [both] Oh. No, Walden! Don't go in! Oh, no, no, no! We'll never see him again! [screaming] Come on in. There's nothing here. I promise. [both gulp] But what about the plop from planet Pooptron monster? Oh, it's only the vacuum cleaner. [gasp] The bug-eyed bug from Buggy Bog! Oh... it's only two plates. [laughs] The headless dude was just the coat rack. [screaming] [both] Monster! [buzzing] Wow! And the scary monster was only a fly. You see? There's not a single monster anywhere. Everything's fine. All those monsters, they were just normal things in the dark. [both laugh] Oops. Thanks, Walden. I'm not gonna be scared of monsters anymore because: [all] Monsters don't exist! Well, sleep tight, little buddy. Goodnight, Wubbzy. [teeth chattering] But, um, guys... Do you wanna stay and have a slumber party? [both] Sure, Wubbzy. [giggles] Boy, this is going to be fun. Let's see what's on TV. Wow, Mad Marvin's Monster Movie Madness. I love this show. [cackling on TV] Don't be scared. Monsters aren't real. [screams] Wow, I don't remember that at all. Oh, all righty. Let's try it again. Whoa! Whoa! Are you okay, little buddy? Yeah, I'm fine. Come on, let's go get that doodleberry pie. You remember doodleberry pie? Sure. I love doodleberry pie! And you remember us? Of course! You guys are the best friends ever. I'd never forget you. Gee, I guess Wubbzy is back to normal. Well, then, let's go get some pie. [moos] Just kidding! [laughs] [laughing]
