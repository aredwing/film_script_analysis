Do you usually feel tremblings, irritability, a knot in your throat, nausea? Do you worry about wars? Earthquakes? No, I don't. Do you like arriving early at parties? Do you repeatedly do the same things? You need to learn how to relax... Great. Welcome, John. GOOD LUCK - Even in here you make his bed? - He doesn't do it right. These sheets are good... I bought them when he was little and still no holes. - There's no power in here. - Unacceptable, we'll complain. We're paying too much for him not to have electricity. This is a good bed, better than mine... Ours is old. Some fresh air. Let's organize his closet. No, let's go. It's not that bad, there's a good view, look. I have to go, Ana. "Sertraline hydrochloride." "Recommended for: treatment of depression symptoms, including depression followed by anxiety symptoms for patients with or without a maniac history;" "Treatment of PTSD;" "Treatment of social phobia or social anxiety disorder." Hi. What are you? What do you mean? Drug addict, schizophrenic... Drug addict. Lucky me. What's your drug? Anxiety pills. Which one? Frontal. Frontal is nice... With vodka it's even better. - I prefer Rivotril. Tried it? - No. - You only take pills? - Yep. I've tried everything. Alfagin, Fluxerin... All of those anxiety pills. Let's make a list: Valium, Lexotan, Vorax... Weed, cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, MDMA... I injected myself... Really? - What now? - Now I'm going to die. Why? Do you need more than that? Are you sick? HIV positive, Hep C, my liver can't handle the meds anymore. For a while, no one knew if a virus was an organic being, they thought it was a crystal. Because a living being, even the lamest one, a bacteria, a fungus... It can reproduce. But not a virus. A virus needs another living being's DNA. It's an alien. An invader. Probably came to this planet on a meteorite. Viruses don't know I exist, I'm only food for them. That's why I'm going to die. How long do you still have to live? I don't know. What about you? I don't know. Want some? What's that? - Diazefest. - What's that? It's like Diazepan, you let it dissolve under your tongue. Want it? How did you get this? - Marcos. - Who? The nurse. Why did he get you this? We have a deal. Although a bottle of wine and a joint would be nice. Nothing better than Diazepan with a joint and good wine. 5 o'clock! We have to go back in. I can get you some Frontal. Really? How? It doesn't matter. I can get it. Come inside. I want Frontal. Frontal? Why the change? I like trying new things. Frontal's not for you. You won't feel a thing. It's not for me. I don't want any trouble. - Yes, you do... - No, I don't want trouble. Yes, you do... You love it. I'll see what I can do, OK? You won't regret it. Cream cheese. Cottage. Parmesan. What is it? "Pick Your Cheese". I got this from the library. The author matches personalities to types of cheese. Some are like Cheddar, Mozzarella, Provolone... - It's a best-seller. - Right... If I compared people to cheese, and said "Life's a cheese", I bet they'd change my medicine. But this guy wrote a book about it, he gives lectures and everyone likes it. I love this. Look at this beautiful day! So beautiful! Fresh air, tranquility... The silence. Listen... And a pharmacy full of drugs! There's my family coming. The one in the red skirt. We always use more of the white paint. Thanks, grandma. They increased the fee again, can you believe it? Really? Really! I don't know how much longer I can afford... I just want you to be well. You're so beautiful... You've always been. Just like your mother. I'm nothing like my mother. Your mouth... Your eyes... Maybe her personality... There's no denying that. Then again, with everything I've already done in my life... Look what I found. Here, child. You used to love that dog. You loved him. What was his name? His name was "Dog". - Don't you want to keep it? - No. I have to go. Won't you stay for the doctor's appointment? I can't today. You can't...? Or you don't want to? I know I wronged you, child, I did. I wronged your mother. Your mother wronged you. You... I always did everything for you. I sacrificed myself... So many times... I heard about something you did in here. Hanging underwear to dry on your window? - This is not a prison. - It isn't? How would you know? At least in here he washes his underwear. But that's not right. We pay for them to wash his clothes. They were taking too long. I ran out of underwear. I'll complain to the coordinator. - It's too expensive. - Enough, Ana... Am I lying? I was shocked with the bill! Do you know how much for some chocolate? R$8,00! R$8,00 for chocolate is absurd! Right? Isn't it time for the appointment? I don't know. - You don't know? - I don't. You should know, shouldn't you? I just want my son back, the way he was. John... Did you hear what your father said? This is very important. You need to tell us what's happening. It's the best way we can help you. I've already lost hope. He'll have to get out of here and take care of his life, because I'm just his mother, that's all I am to him. This therapy is meant for the parents, not for us. The parents come, they cry a little, then hold hands to other parents who are worse than them and then they feel better, and think they helped us. Hey! Too late... Good, thank you. Here you go, darling. Who's next, who's next...? Give me this. We're not getting enough champagne, can you do something about that? No, that one's mine. This is yours. No, wait... Can you get me another one? Come on, for you. Tell me something you never told anyone. What for? For luck. First times always bring luck. I can become invisible, sometimes. I was invisible once, too. Did anyone see it? I mean... were you alone? I was meditating, controlling the power of the mind. Samyama. "I love you"? No. Samyama. It's yoga. You do yoga and take drugs? It helps me to forget my problem. My body and my mind never got along. What did you do to become invisible? I had Frontal with Fanta. - Grape or orange? - Orange. In the beginning I didn't know exactly how it worked. Maybe I wasn't really invisible, because... Everybody seemed invisible. Pedro, stop with that noise! For the love of God! Damn it, stop! There's rarely anyone on the street. And when there is, they only look forward. If you look at someone and that person looks back, that's a contact. And nobody wants that. My mother sees everything. But she never pays attention. And my father... Never mind. My brother and his girlfriend only had eyes for each other. They wouldn't see me even if I was visible. Being invisible is not all bad. You can hear girls talk... - Did you do it? - I did... Almost all of it. - Did you act like a saint? - No, of course not. - It didn't fit. - No! - Was it too big? - Remember your remote control? - Really?! - I swear! You can come real close... You just can't touch. What is this?! Fuck, kid! But I only found that out later. Too late. Later I discovered that I could be invisible only for some. You brat! What's your problem? With my brother I still had some kind of contact. With my mother, I didn't even need Frontal. Fanta was enough. Do you think it's normal for teens to iron clothes? Yeah, in his own room. He takes the ironing board into his room! Yeah... I don't know, I never noticed anything... No, I know the smell of pot. Wait a sec, my battery's dying. Hold on. Fuck! Yeah, no, I prefer to sleep... I need 12 straight hours. I haven't slept well since Wednesday. No, I'll just have another Frontal... Yeah... Text me if you need anything. OK... Kisses. Bye. Have you tried with grape? No. I get scared of getting the opposite effect. - It always works with orange? - Always. I mean, once it didn't. But it's because I had 2 Fantas for 1 Frontal. Then, the part of my brain that controls invisibility got stuck and I was invisible for a long time. And when did it go away? When I licked a girl. You licked her? What is this?! Are you crazy?! Help! There's a nutjob in the bathroom! Get out! Get away from me! Get out! Help! - What is it? - That kid licked me. Oh, really? I wonder why saliva makes invisibility go away... Saliva is part of your body but it's not your body, you see? For example, in comic books or movies, when someone turns invisible, the clothes turn too. But if the invisible person spits, we can see the spit on the floor. Is there a movie where that happens? I don't know, I never saw it. Maybe there is. Ouch! That hurt! A punch makes invisibility go away too, depending on the case. - I prefer licking. - Me too. But it depends, some people can't be licked. She is... - I'll kill her... - Mommy, where's my cookie? Not now, Luiza... Hurry up, mom! She's always following me... - Mom, hurry! - She's like a tick... I can't even get in the house... Luiza, stop! Fuck! Look at me! Stop driving me crazy! Tell me if I look crazy to you! What is this?! What did you do, man?! Fuck! Come here, Luiza. What...?! He's crazy! Hey! Hey, help! Fuck, he's crazy... I'm sorry. He hurt me. He's sick... We're getting you into a clinic. Are you happy now? - Were you? - What? Happy. No. Are you now? No, I don't think so. Wanna go outside and smoke? I don't smoke. Wanna go outside and not smoke? I do. Of course. Do you have anyone who loves you? My family, I guess. They love me, but they don't really like the way I am. You? No, no one. I can love you. Really? I think so. Why? I don't know that... That's a "durd". A... what? A "durd" is when you know it, but you can't explain it. The smell of coffee, taste of chocolate... Oh... I thought it was some kind of cheese. The cheese is "curd". So, is the taste of cheese curd... a "durd"? You're silly... You want to love me. I do. There are many kinds of love. Which one do you want? I know what you're thinking. Not only invisibility, you read minds, too? You think I just want to have sex with you. Why "just"? Sex is a great kind of love. There's something else I never told anyone. You never had sex. I read minds too. Go, go, go... Lorena, Lorena... Lorena, please... Something's wrong with my meds... My pill used to be blue, but the nurse gave me a red one. OK... Pills sometimes change colors. No, no, no! Listen... I'm not a nudist, but you guys are forcing me to it. My underwear is taking a week to be cleaned. - This is not a hotel! - Lorena, look into my eyes. Sit here, please. First of all, you look beautiful. Ask your mom to send you simpler clothes. OK, thanks for the tip, you're wonderful and kind. Felipe... This is a clinic. It's not a fashion runway. Really? I hadn't noticed... John! You scared me! "Jose." The one on the table. "Jose S. is... apparently healthy"? Actually he was a huge actor as a child, and now he's depressed. That's tough, it's complicated... "Medicine: Vodol." "Apparently healthy..." - "Jucimara." - Who? - "Jucimara." - That one. "Jucimara M. R.: started taking alcohol with codeine 3 years before coming..." What's codeine? It's that alkaline substance from batteries... So she must be very electric, right? "Patient: Julio". That's the black one. There's always a racial quota, so... "Julio L., whose mother is a schizophrenic, consumed heroine and alcohol for 3 years..." Actually, his mother's a drug dealer. Don't come near him. Take care of your wallet. I'm serious. Be careful. "Laura." That smoker over there. See her? She's drowsy... But she's into some dark stuff, you know? Talking to spirits... "Patient Laura C. S. used crack for 11 months." "Judith." Fucking hot... She's my best friend here, you know? I think we were siblings in another life. I believe in those things. "Patient Judith D. has regularly consumed ecstasy for 2 years and cocaine. Six months prior to admission she used LSD. One day prior to admission she began having paranoid ideas and motor hyperactivity. The combination of alcohol and Hipofagin gave her delusions and an aggressive behavior towards her grandmother. HIV-positive. Due to her hepatitis condition, she can no longer take her prescribed medicine." Craziness is not related to what you say or think. It's related to paying your bills, cleaning up your mess. If you clean up your mess, pay your bills, you can go as crazy as you want. If you've got money, you can pay someone else to clean the mess for you. With a lot more money, you can think and say whatever you want and no one will ever complain. I never needed anyone's money. I knew how to clean up my mess. No one ever said I was crazy. Her grandmother's a drug dealer! A dealer! Look... - Drug dealer! - I'll go wash it. Half a Rupinol... Some Diazepan... A quarter of Hantina... Hey, hey! Salud! - Uno, dos, tres! - What is this? Just drink it, it's great! John, come here... Come on! Now give it here... Do a samurai... Yeah, a samurai... Dame en la boquita? - Quiere en la boquita? - Si, si, la boquita. Damn, this is great! Wow, damn... Look at the nature in here, guys. Nature is something magical... I don't ever wanna leave here. I really don't. Felipe, you're crazy. Not crazy. I'm an artist. A crazy artist is not crazy. He's an artist. Nurse, nurse, nurse... Play it cool. Go for it! Go, Judith, go! Dance, dance... Hey, give that back. The mind's never happy with its own functioning. That's the problem with thinking machines, they think about themselves, they want to work differently. The mind never settles down. And the body can't keep up. The body's the problem, John. The body. I like the body. Yours? It's cute. I like yours better. You have good taste. And condoms? Do you have any? No... Too bad. But I can get it. No more pills. Everything's being accounted for, there's no more. I don't want pills. I want condoms. Really? Why should I care? Money. How much? I have 20 bucks. Not much, huh? It's all I've got. What about that iPod of yours? Are you serious? Isn't it worth it? Got it. What time is your therapy? After lunch. Can you skip it? I'll try. I'll leave the key there, you take it, go to the laundry room and wait for me there. Are you sure? The laundry room stinks... - Any better ideas? - No. Go on. I'll leave the key in here. You go to the laundry room, lock the door and wait for me there. I'll knock six times, like this: - Then you open. - And you come in. Of course, I'll go in, we'll lock the door, and then we... We'll see what happens. If the key's not in there, I couldn't get it. If it's there but I don't show, I didn't manage to skip class. What do I do with the key then? Good question... Just leave it there. Better yet, keep it and give it to me later. But won't they miss it? Of course they will. - Then what? - Well, then... We'll see what happens later. Yes. Great. We'll see what happens later. - Excuse me. - Hello, John. Come in. What's the matter? I don't feel so good, I vomited this morning. I can't eat a thing... Diarrhea... What else are you feeling? Body aches... My arms and my legs hurt. When I look to the sides, my eyes hurt. Well, get some rest, then. It's probably some virus. But I have therapy today. I'll reschedule. Will you? Thank you. Damn, I can't go to therapy today... I need rest. I can't eat a thing... Ouch! - What happened? - I cut myself. Lemon is a great disinfectant. What's all that for? It's a secret. "What is essential is invisible to the eye." Buddha. The Little Prince. See you later. I know exactly what you're thinking. No, you don't. If I didn't, you wouldn't be talking to me. Who said I'm talking to you? Aren't you? No, I'm not. Yes, you are. But I know exactly what you're thinking. No, you don't. We're back at the beginning. Then it's the end. The end? Of what? Of the conversation. Didn't you say there was no talk, that it was just thought? Then... The end of thought. What's that like? What? The end of thought. The end. No thoughts. No thinking. There's only one way to do that. How? Dying. I know another one. Someone who could love me. Someone who knew how I was. Who'd look me in the eyes... Who could give me pleasure. Someone I could give pleasure to. All those people were one and the same. When I went into her I was born. Your guitar has no strings. I could kill myself with them. I know, but why didn't you leave it in storage? I like looking at it. I wanted to hear you play. There's no way. There is. Now? Good morning... What's up...? Wow! I always dreamed of having this guitar. Why have you never had it? Do you know how much it costs? About 4 grand. Take it. Have you forgotten we're invisible? No, that wouldn't be right... But I'll take these strings for my guitar. Let's go in? Are you sure you want to do this? I am. Now you've been introduced to my family. Invisible. Shall we? John, what do you think about what you've done? What I think? I think it's great. Best day of my life. So, you think running away was good for you? It was. Once in a while, living is good. By running away? Without facing the problem that brought you in here? I'm in love. John, all I know is you've extended your stay here. Thank God. I wear sunglasses So my tears can hide And when you stand by me The tears start running down And I feel that thing in my chest I feel that whole mess I know that I'm a vampire - That will never have peace... - I wanted to learn how to play. I've tried, but my fingers can't hold the chords right... There are many songs you can play. Like what? Like this one, but instead of doing the F here... You do it here. And you do the G here. - I can't, it's hard. - Try it. Trust me, my fingers don't obey my orders. - Here? - Yes, now this... There. I wear sunglasses So my tears can hide - It's terrible. - No, it's beautiful. And when you stand by me The tears start running down And I feel that thing in my chest I feel that whole... No, you play. Then sing with me. And I feel that thing in my chest I feel that whole mess I know that I'm a vampire That will never have peace in his heart Sometimes I wonder Why I do things like this And the summer night fades away With that crazy jasmine scent I get drunk on you I get drunk on passion In my body, blood doesn't flow Only fire and vulcan lava We're in power. You see? Us, men. You're a woman, Judith. - I meant humans. - I see. In second place, the dog. In third, it's a tie between the cow and the horse. - In fifth, the cat. - In fourth. No, fifth, because the horse and the cow are tied. Wait, I'm lost. Recap, please. Men first. Dogs second. Horse and cow in third. Cats in fifth. I see... And after that? After that, mammals in general. Then, fish and birds, also tied. Then reptiles, amphibious, and all the other small animals we don't even know their names, bacteria... And last of all, virus, who's barely anything. And where am I? You...? I think you're right here, between the man and the dog. I'm in a good position. In my list, you're first. Then, women. After that, men. Then... Minerals, plants... The brain, John, works in 5 stages. The first stage is Kishpa. There's a lot of energy in movement, it's a brain that thinks a lot, moves a lot, gets angry a lot. You can't focus on much, and when you can, it's for the wrong reasons. Jealousy, envy... The second stage is Mudra. In Mudra, you only like to think about silly things, like money. You don't want to do anything, just eat, sleep, have pleasure. Get high. The third stage is Vikshipa. A stage that alternates between movement and calm. The fourth stage is Uekale. You think one thing at a time, and your mind understands. You start to control your thoughts. And the fifth stage is Mirudra. In Mirudra, the mental waves stop. You understand the silence. You forget yourself. Then you become invisible. Maybe you do, but that's not what's important. The important is for you to have control over yourself. Wow... You know all about yoga. - No, I don't... - Yes, you do. If I had learned before... Before pumping my cells with nicotine, alcohol, sugar... You're a good Mirudra. That's Samyiama, you know? Samyama are the five stages. Time for bed. Let's go to my bedroom. And your roommate? She took a dose of Amplitil, she'll only wake up tomorrow. Do you have condoms? I do. I'm coming, I'm coming... We could have a child. Who knows, maybe one day. Maybe today. Are you crazy?! Do you have a death wish? I don't care. You're an idiot. I hope you have more luck than me. I love rummaging through the dirt. It's therapeutic. I love seeing you rummage the dirt. - Stop that. - It's true. You're therapeutic, too. No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - No. - Yes, you... - No! I think so... It's good you're leaving, how much more time? Two weeks. But I've decided not to leave. What do you mean? I don't want to, I want to stay. Are you crazy? If I want to stay, then I'm crazy. If I'm crazy, I have to stay. It all works out. No,it's all wrong! Being crazy is all about pain, suffering, disease. You have to study, work, you know? Live. Why waste time in here? It's not a waste of time. On the contrary. It was a coincidence, running into you here. Why? There's only people like you and me in here. You and me are very different. And also very similar, we both need some kind of medicine, some drug, some antimonotony poison... It works. The problem is, people who drink poison usually die. People usually die anyway. But some are hasty. They don't like to wait, they're in a rush to leave. I have no rush to leave here. I meant "here", this planet. What's the joke? Do you think you're funny? - Marcos... - I'm not talking to you. Get up. Get up. Ouch, you're hurting me. - Come with me. - Let me go! You're hurting me... What is it? Move. I have no expectations with you, Judith. Just to get married, have children and live together till death do us part. John... John... You're silly. That's why you like me. Let's go to the laundry room today? Today? - Can you get the key today? - I can. Same time? No. At four. OK. I'll leave the key in the same place. It's hard without prescription... But honey, listen, I need this medicine. I need it. I can't have this other one. Is it serious? Extremely serious. I have this condition, I can't take this medicine. It says right here. It can't be used in patients who are also taking blood thinners. I have the prescription for the blood thinner here, look... So I can only take Ciprelin. But for Ciprelin... I'll only get a prescription by Monday. I can't sell without it, it's the law. I can't have sleepless nights until Monday! And if I have this other one I could have thrombosis, I could bleed internally. I could die! I beg your forgiveness, but the law is very strict. Don't make me laugh, honey! "Laws are too strict"? For old people's medicine? For poor people? Is that it? With all the corruption going on, and you tell me the "laws are strict"? With the pharmaceutical industry making up diseases like aviary flu, swine flu, A flu, B flu, C flu... Just to sell medicine. You know that... Fine, keep it. Don't sell it if you don't want to. There's a drugstore in every corner. There are more drugstores than gospel churches. This is a sick country, honey. Sick in its body... And in its spirit. Mrs. Celia? What...? How do you know I live here? I'm a friend of your granddaughter's. You're not her friend, you work at the drugstore. - What do you want? - I just want to talk to you. I promise you I'm a friend of Judith's. Was this woman her mother? She was. Got any rolling paper? No. What happened to her? She left before me. She was pretty. Very pretty. She had a short stay here... How old was Judith when her mother died? Thirteen. And her father? She had none. But that's common... Very common. She didn't come out of him. Mothers are mothers. Fathers... who knows? - Want some? - No, thank you. She got an award at school for her paintings. A beautiful painting... She painted beautifully. And where is it? The painting? Gone. She'd trade anything for drugs. So sad... Her clothes... She'd trade them. A stereo I gave her. That's just sad... Addictions are horrible. It's a terrible disease. At least pot is cheap. Did you throw away a diary she had? Did she show you that? No, I didn't throw it away. She made great drawings, didn't she? I'll go get it for us. IT WAS SO MUCH LOVE, BUT SO MUCH LOVE, THAT I'D LOSE MY VOICE TRYING TO SAY HIS NAME The mind wants to be God. The body remembers we're all animals. My mind told me to obey my body. And so I did. My body was happy. It lived a lot, very fast. My mind chased after it. Judith was leaving when the dog showed up. Silly and beautiful, newly born. He thought he was invisible, but he wasn't. The dog had just arrived, with no rush, nowhere to go. Judith couldn't go away and leave the dog like that. So she stayed. The dog looked at her as if waiting for an answer. Like someone who waits for the seed to grow and bare fruit. Some tea for you, my boy. Thank you very much. Be careful with the lemon, it burns with the Sun. Judith really needed to leave. She couldn't delay it any more. Judith knew the dog would follow wherever she went. He belonged with her. But Judith couldn't take the dog. She needed to push him away at any cost, so she pretended not to love the dog. He'll suffer a little. He'll grow. If he comes with me, he'll never grow. I'm leaving and you can't come. Why not? Dogs aren't allowed where I'm going. Do you want to go? No. I have to go. I love you, Dog. John... I'm here. I'm going to die. No, you're not. I am. Today. Now. I'm dying soon. I don't want you to die. I know. But you have to stay alive. What for? To remember me. Promise me you'll stay alive? Promise me? I promise. How many people have you watched dying? None. I'll be your first. Yes, you will. Good luck. Judith. Judith... My love... My love. They changed my medicine. Then I remembered she asked me to stay alive and remember her. So I decided not to take my medicine anymore. I stopped taking all of them. I spent three months in the clinic, then I left. I went back to school. I graduated. Got married, had a daughter. Got separated. A long time afterwards, I took the test. I don't have HIV. I was lucky. "Boa Sorte" (2015) AKA "Good Luck" The Brazilians Like us on Facebook for more information on new releases:
