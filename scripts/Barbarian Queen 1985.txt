I keep run back to the village to tell somebody we're leaving. There is no anybody. I'm starving. - I thought they took you. - One. I killed him. I got his horse, and got all this. They killed my friend Kantacka. We're going after them. But...first we'll eat! We are not exactly an army, isn't it? It's a silly. Even fish knows to avoid swimming near a moving boat.

Save a little for the night children. We have to leave them something. Or they will eat you while you sleep. Anytime an animal kills a person, the God turn the animal into a little child. - And the child has to run to the forest forever. - Every night, forever and ever. They are probably watching you right now. - The children must be very hungry. - I leave them my share. I will, too. Is it safe to go to sleep now? It's safe. Hold there! Hold where you are! Don't try it! Get up your horses! No one who rides from the kingdom ride through here. We ride against to you, fool. Haven't you not enough sence to find out who your friends are? Before you try to kill them? - We did that two days ago. - And we are all who are left to our village. And we all left of ours. - Will be on our way. - Wait! If you raise the sword against Arrow, do you fight for us. If you can make our journey easier, help us. We fight only for our own quest. There is only one who can pass safely between here and the city. I'll take you. When I was a little girl I told my father I was going out and kill a bear. Then I saw how big a bear was... For two week after that, I didn't leave the village. We are not little girls anymore. There are no little girls anymore. Let's go ! I usually do this alone, on foot. Bringing messages. Taramis! Taramis! -It's a little boy. -And you drive this away from our lunch because you saw rebels? You've got to stop wondering around out here. Some day I'll find my parents. And then I live with them again. Take care now! Yes, sir! Follow me! My father discovered this catacombes. There the only safe passage for rebels into the city. Go quietly now! The city gate is just above. A....... She's made it through again. I'm fine. -I think we have to keep you here for a while. ####less, every day. What they want? Their people are prisoners. They want to free them. They are brave and strong. We haven't travel all this way to be turned back. I can't let you fight. We'll start a battle we are not ready to finish. We honor your cause. But our battle can't wait. Come with me ! My father is very careful about everything. It's just the way he is. - Here, this is for you. - Thank you. No one you know? - Freedom doesn't matter there. - Freedom always matters. One of your people? Come on, fight! Didn't I say, "fight" ? Gladiators. Practicing. Now listen. Gladiator is the best of any slave. Now let's see how you like the worst. - Name! - Argan! Remember this, Argan! And listen carefully. Lord Arrakur wants a good show for Sunday. So you'll fight to make him happy. He doesn't own my soul yet. Amethea said to stay out offside until they come back. Hold! Is a beautiful dress for you. Come on, buy it! - Oh, buy this dress. It's beautiful. - No. Some days nobody buys. How we get worth to them? Some places is very hard. And some places are possible, I...see your future. Look at it! Come! - Tiniara! I have missing Theomes, anywhere. - No I have you were watching her. - No I thought you were watching her! - I look away, she was gone. Come, we have got to hurry. - Come! I see your future. - Hey, have you see... She is blind. - Who are you? - What are you calling around after? You fight! - Yeah! - We would want to get them something we want should they would like, will we? I'm gonna a have to a rebel! You were first last time. This was mine! - Theodor gone. Maybe the others. - Now! You find your sister! She got away. You go back to your father. He can't afford to loose his bravest warrior. Go one! Nobody enters in palace without permission. - But I want to go with him. - Move alone! - Guards! - She wants to go with you, milord! Bring her in! Clean her up, first! Look! We can't go in after her! I can't go in there, I can't get to Argan... Let me go! But I can do something about this! Come on you! Guards, get her! Let me go! You are not strong enough. Amethea! Amethea! I hope he wasn't close relative! - I don't know who is. - Come, come! There not ###of you rebels, to pretends thet you don't know on another. And if you hold your tongue, as he ...is you soon be were you can talk to him again. - I know rebels! - We'll see. There is nothing I can tell you. - I want to know where your people are. - Where he is...my people... You now, pain is a wonderful thing. It we let us now when it could be something wrong. and let us when we should tell what we know. You are much to beautiful girl, to let your self be broken into food for the royal dogs. - Dariac, what's the matter? - They've got caught. - Which of them? - All of them. So you see, we took they cause as a###. of course, and now their capture could be our own. We've got to do something. But they are the only one who're a good fight, you said. What talken we do now? - We can't let them die. - We cannot go back with the plan we had. I hope we hadn't told the Arrakur's prison. Dariac! Perhaps this was the only way they having showing us that something worth dying for. - We can't let them die! - You, stay here! Perhaps you can't quite see the truth. Perhaps we have to give you little more light. Rebels make life difficult for people who obey the laws. You'll be performing a service if you told me where there are hiding. You do want lite be pleasant for a citizen, don't you? - She'll talk. - She'd better. You'll tell us everything. Well, well... They told me you are very beautiful. My warriors always seems have trouble with beautiful women. One way, or another. If you come to kill me, you just kill. I don't need to listen to your talk! To kill a woman like you, would be such a waste. Come down! Let me see you. With your clothes off! You going to learn. Eventualy. That it's much less painful to do things in my way. You, and your rebel friends... I have not rebels friends! Oh, thets it's time you stardet being more agreeable. Clothes off! I will never understand why some people is so animate about choosing the wrong side. No, you never will. I'm loosing my patience. And I never had very much to begin with. When I command you to strip you garment of you do as you were told! There some people in this world who will never be your slaves. Before I am through with you, you will beg to kiss my feet. And you will tell me why you came here... and you tell me where the rebels are, and who they are... And you will stay at my side and watch them die. You now where you take her. I'm not here to torture you. We have a man who does that. And I'm trying to keep you from having to meet him. I just want a little information. Other lifes are more important then mine. It's not death in your face. It's a great deal of discomfort why you are still alive. You really don't want to get send downstairs. Believe me! Life can be quite pleasant here... Really... Why don't you take a moment to think about it? - Will you tell me now? - No! You fool! Come on! You are not here to supervise! You are a beast! I have not seen you here before. - No... - Well? We are to get you.. know each other. I just want a little something to eat, ok? Let's find a quiet corner! How do you get in? Is anyone else? We came with Amethea. All three of us. Amethea ? How did she... She is in the city. We came here to rescue you! I can't believe she survived... She is with some people...they are rebels. They try to fight But they are just not army... If the army is they want, we can give them one. If you can take them away from wine and women long enough to fight... There are ##women and there are ###wine. But if these man see a chance to win their freedom, they fight! - I wished they would just go gome, - I wished we could. It may be our only chance. To die... We are all that left of our people. That is a responsibility. We have to help her father! You think it's right? To put our future in her hands? She will fight for us! I have never been good follow in. - When I was young boy I had dreams, just like you... - Like her... I should say "yes", then... before I get much older... and the dreams are gone. Even past remembering. We were brave once. We were warriors. Now the time is approaching... Now, we will fight again! Where have I seen you before? You are the girl at the river at ### That was a night to remember... -Can I stay here with you? -Oh, my child! Absolutely! How did you come to be here? And will you get me a dog to play with? No...a cat... I should love have a cat... A cat you shall have... Away with you! What...what shall I do with her? Have you no imagination? And now let's see if you is pleasing...as I remember... If it hurts you have only yourself to blow. Every time you moved machine is tighten. So you don't want to move anymore then you have to. I made this all myself, it's very ingenious, don't you think? Here, watch! No ####,no mess, no bother... No slimy blood splashed all over the room. You don't look like you appreciated science. Drink some...say please... No manners at all! Well, I'm not wan't to torture somebody. You must learn to say "please". You must learn to say all sorts of things... like...how you've got into the city. And what you came here for. And where your rebel friends are. Please, let me interrupt! She still has nothing to say to us? She is a strong one! You broke her stronger! You don't know her, do you? No...
