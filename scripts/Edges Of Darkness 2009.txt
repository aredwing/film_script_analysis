Well, almost nothing. What happened? Where did it all go wrong? For that I have no answers. But I do have a story. - ( snarls ) - ( screaming ) ( gasps ) ( gunshots ) ( gunshot ) Come on. Come on. - ( snarling ) - ( loud chewing ) Man: The gates of Cameo Place keep the undead at bay. Mostly. "A few slip through from time to time, but our landlord is always taking care of them." - ( loud bang ) - ( snarling ) It looks like his gun is jammed. Maybe not. Get away from the window. ( typing ) Dean, he needs our help. What are we-- Dean, we've got to help him. What can he do? He's beyond any help. Only a bullet can save him. Woman: 68 years old, and this is how he goes? - Nasty little things. - ( continues typing ) Pure evil on earth. That's exactly why we need to stay put till help arrives. Who's gonna run the generator, Dean? Who knows? I'm not volunteering. Get away from the window. I bet as soon as the stupid thing loses power, you'll be out there trying to get more gas again. Yeah, but only to have these on to drown out all the noise. Why are you so cold sometimes? Years of rejection. I am dying of boredom! God! Go ahead, ignore me. Ignore me, Dean, like you always do. I'll just sit here. Fine. One of these days... You know, never mind. Bye. "With Mr. Charles dead and gone, unable to thin the number of ghouls that slip through our gates, who knows how long it will take before they're clawing down our front door?" Woman: Oh, God, what was that? Woman #2: Looks like my landlord's arm. Thank you. It's my only good deed for the day, bucko. My only one. - Why the fuck isn't this locked? - I was waiting for you. I heard gunshots. - Gunshots? - Yeah, a few minutes ago. I told you about keeping this door locked. Look, I'm sorry. Well? There's motherfucking arm bones in the yard. Arm bones?! I'm so sick of these motherfucking zombies! Got motherfucking arm bones in the yard. ( sighs ) It's a motherfucking plague, that's what it is. Fucking biblical shit. I do not need this. Please, did you get it? What? Fuck, woman, are you crazy? Would you close those motherfucking curtains? - Damn! - All right. They're closed. Now tell me-- God damn! Zombie apocalypse, woman's got the fucking curtains open. Shit! Didn't I tell you to board that shit up? Damn. What if those things tried to get in? Look, we're on the second floor. Unless they learn to sprout wings and fly, I think we're safe. What were you doing out there anyway, champ? - My dad, he-- - Yeah, the guy in the street, worthless. Maybe you shouldn't talk shit about things you don't fucking know. Come on, Marcus. Let's get out of here. We're going to get your father. Go ahead, go. Go! Mom. We need him. ( loud chewing ) He's dead. What you need is to live. What you need is to take care of this little man and you ain't gonna do it out there. ( sighs ) It's okay. - ( sighs ) - Baby, baby, please talk to me. I got it. It's in the trunk of the car. Better not be fucking with me, okay? I'm real hungry. Yeah, and I'm starving like a motherfucker, but those things out there are crawling over the motherfucking car. You want that shit? You stick your head out there in broad daylight and get it. I'll get it when the sun goes back down. - ( squealing ) - Hey hey hey hey hey! You know how I feel about that noise. Shit. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. It's bad out there, ain't it? Hey, we been through worse. I'm scared. But we'll get through it, okay? We always do. Come here, mama. Let me love you up. That's some corny-- ( generator whirring ) I'm trapped in here with this self-engrossed boy-child. I can't live like this. Not anymore. There's gotta be some survivors out there. Yeah. If he goes out tomorrow to get gas, I'll leave. And then he'll come back and he'll realize what a jerk he's been. Or he won't, and probably in his dumpy little brain, he'll think that I'm the jerk. Then he'll villanize me in one of his unreadable stories. ( snoring ) ( happy tune playing ) Woman: Help, help me! Oh, no. You got-- you got the-- oh, Lord, Jesus Christ! ( screams ) Woman: Help me! Fuck! Look, there's no way you could have known. Yeah yeah. Guess we really are the last ones, huh? You want some? No. Sorry, we're out of fried chicken. Woman: Tough kid. Mother: You have no idea. - Has he cried yet? - No. Woman: I had one. I miscarried before Marcus. What? Are we girlfriends now? No, I just thought-- I was just trying-- Besides, I didn't miscarry. I killed her. First, give me the Albatron mixture. Yes, good. Soon, my dear, I shall have super strength, astounding wit and a full head of glorious hair, the whole world will see at the lnternational Expo for Revolutionary Science. - I shall be Scientist of the Century. - ( giggles ) I will go with you. When is the Expo? Sometime in March. Woman on TV: That's pretty soon, my dear. Man: Soon enough for you, Heidi. Record the process. ( gagging ) Woman: Oh, gross! Disgusting. Oh, gross! That's gross. ( clears throat ) It's done. It is done. Nothing's beyond my mental grasp. Heidi: Just one thing. What is it? You're bald! ( laughing ) - What? - You're bald! You're bald. You're bald! You're bald! - ( laughing ) - Dana. This movie's awesome. ( electricity powers down ) Oh, come on. Oh, come on, please! Dana: We've got plenty of kerosene here for everything. It'll be kind of romantic, don't you think? Romantic? If you could block out the moans of the living dead just outside, bumping into the walls at all hours knowing that at any second that rotten death can come crashing through the door, the moonlight on their decrepit bodies, blood the color of molasses in the blue light, their foul stench that creeps into your nose and onto your taste buds, hideous claws ripping the flesh from your ribs, and you can't wake up from the nightmare-- Thanks, Dean. I wasn't planning on going to sleep again tonight anyway. - God, jerk. - The mail-- Iet's see what's in there. Let's see. Junk junk. Ooh, coupons, I guess and bills, a bill. Small package from "Takoru Technologies Worldwide." - Bill, check-- - Takoru Tech? That's my new processor. It is. What the hell? You've had it this whole time? Well, what do you think, Dean? Bills and junk mail aren't the most important thing on my mind these days. Yeah, but you knew I was waiting for this, Dana. Not really. Anyway, it was sitting right here, Dean. Maybe if you didn't spend so much time on that stupid computer of yours, you'd be a little more aware of your surroundings. - It's a hobby, that's all. - No, it's not. It's more than that. I can't compete. Sometimes I wanna take that thing and throw it out into the pouring rain. - Throw yourself in the rain. - Dean. Okay, I was kidding. I only meant that you should cool off. Don't get all huffy. Well, it's too late for that. All right, I'm sorry. It's just that I've really been waiting for this. I'm sorry, really. Yeah, you're sorry. Take a look outside, Dean. There are walking dead people everywhere, slowly closing in. Oh, hey, wait. Let me go outside and check the mail for Dean. In case you didn't know, the mailman's dead. Yeah, everyone's dead. Bring your lamp. I gotta get this thing in there. - Why? - Come on, you can help. No power and it still has him. - ( knock on door ) - Man: Open the fucking door. Hurry up now. Stanley. - ( woman grunting ) - Lie down. Who's your man? - Where'd you find it? - Frankie's. Get your ass down! Frankie's. Looked like he was squirreling away for a long winter. - Where's Frankie? - Fucking zombies must have got him. I don't know. I couldn't find him. Can I unwrap it now? Whoa, I don't think-- I mean, look, we still gotta clean it. Smells like it shit itself. Baby, can I have a taste? Please, baby. Please, just a little taste, please? All right, but just a taste. Hey, remember what I told you about noise? ( grunting ) Okay. Hey, that's enough. Hey hey! - That's enough! - I'm sorry. - I'm just hungry. - I know. Me too. But if we gonna make this last, we gotta be smart. Get up here. Please let me go. Bitch, you must be crazy. Get your ass up here. Here, open this. What, what is it? - Just open it. - Okay. It's a hardware upgrade. Latest in processor technology. I was selected months ago to try it out for free. You mean like a sweepstakes prize or something? One out of a million. Congratulations. - Ow! - ( sizzles ) Okay, I'm ready. Give it here. Hold on. It says to use protection when handling. Hold on. Where are you going? Just to let you know, very soon you shall be quicker and more powerful, enabling you to function like never before. As soon as my slowpoke wife returns. Dana! Put those on. You're pathetic. ( sighs ) We gotta get that generator going. We gotta see what it does. Okay, I'm gonna go pee. - ( muffled screaming ) - I told you about the noise. Now this is your last friendly reminder, you understand? Please please please, don't hurt me. If you gonna be a guest in our house, you gonna be clean. Please! ( crying ) ( shower running ) Hey. Don't. We can't stay here. - Yeah, no one's keeping you. - That's not what I mean. He's sick. He needs medication daily. You're in luck, girlfriend. There's a drugstore a few blocks over. It's not that hard to get to. It's rare. The chances of them having it are slim. You obviously have a suggestion. Yeah, we have a stockpile. Where? It's in an apartment across town. Good luck with that. Come on, you know I'd never make it. Maybe not. - Dana. - Yes, what is it? I made up my mind to go to find fuel for the generator. I'll check Mr. Charles' place too. He probably has a ton of supplies. Canned food, water, maybe even more gas. His loss... - our gain. - Well, you know my answer to that. Well, I'm going. Well, I'm not. I'm not going out there at night. No, not at night. Well, I'm not going tomorrow either. Fine, whatever. It'll be a one-man mission. - Good luck. - Good luck. ( scoffs ) ( woman whimpering ) Put something on! You find something that fits? Stanley: Find her something? Found it. No! Bitch, you know I'm gonna suck your motherfucking blood, and trust me, there's more painful ways to extract it. ( screams ) Eat. No no no no. We're civilized in this house. Why? Look, what we have here is what an intelligent man would call a symbiotic relation. We need you to survive. And without us, you're fish food. You're not gonna kill me? That is not any kind of question. The question is is how comfortable are you gonna live? You got me? Mm-hmm. She's eating. - You smelled it? - Sweetest blood I ever smelled. Oh, God, I wanna suck her dry. Yeah, me too. - You know I love you, right? - Yeah, back at you, babe. - ( gulps ) - What's the matter? I don't know. It tastes funny. Let me see that. You always got something to say. - ( winces ) - Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's not that bad. It don't taste like any human blood I've ever tasted. Do you even remember the last time you had human blood? I think so. And it didn't taste like that. I don't think we should drink it. It's fine. Hey, maybe it's her diet. You remember Bulgaria? God, I can still taste the garlic. Yeah, with all this going on, Lord knows what she's been eating. Still, it don't taste as good as I thought it would. It never does. Woman: Damon, don't go. - Damon. - ( loud chewing ) - Damon. - ( low growling ) ( slurping ) ( gunshot ) ( baby crying ) - ( baby growls ) - ( gunshot ) ( keyboard clacking ) There's a map book in the kitchen. Mark the address. Tomorrow you'll have what you need. You're welcome, Marcus. ( slithering ) ( mechanical voice ) Pervert pervert pervert! ( gasps ) She left? Yeah. You sent her home. Mommy. ( humming ) You look rested. Good. This is-- ( sniffs ) - It's my... - Shit, girl, don't say it. I don't wanna know. I'll get the wife, okay? Just-- Just-- just chill, okay? Stellie, Stellie! Stellie, get your ass over here. Look, I need you to draw the blood, okay? - Think you can do that? - Yeah. Yeah, I can handle that. Look, I was tripping before, okay? But I'm cool now. I promise. What's the problem? She's having girl trouble, you know? - She's having her period? - Now why you have to go and say that? You know how I feel about that talk. You are such a child. Get your ass in there. I'll get something for that. Calm down, girl. I ain't gonna gut you. I just need to pull a little something-something. So what's your name? Why do you wanna know? Seeing as how we're gonna be spending some time together, I thought that we should introduce. Suit yourself. Natalie. My name is Natalie. Well, hi, Natalie. I'm Stellie. You know, you look as sweet as you smell. Thank you, I think. Guess that sounded better in my head. Stellie. What is it, Natalie? Can I come out of the room? We'll see. ( gasping ) ( zombie growling ) That's a nice machete. How could something that looks and smells so sweet end up tasting so sour? There's something wrong with that girl. This ain't right. You going somewhere? We need another. Well, what about jungle fever in apartment 16? Look, I'm just saying. I mean, you think we should replace her? I really think we should give it some time. Look, this is not gonna work. Not in the long run. I need to go out there and find another. Hopefully a male. We can feed off of him, use her to supplement. Maybe breed 'em. Breeding. That's pretty smart. Yeah, I thought it up. Hopefully, he'll taste a little better. Well, what about us? I trust you. You sure about that? - Yes, I'm sure. - Oh, yeah? Stanley: Tonight. ( door creaks ) Who the fuck are you supposed to be? - Shh! - ( screams ) - You dead son of a-- - ( shushing ) Good. I'm going to snap your neck like a twig. My cactus. ( gasps ) Whatever that was cannot exist. But those things outside do. Everything's too real to be a dream. I could be dreaming. Maybe this is all one great nightmare... that seems to be half a year, but it's actually one night of sleep. No no, it's all too vivid, too complex. ( heart beating ) ( squelching ) ( door closes ) We have power? How do we have power? We have no power, Dean. It's the backup power. I have a little left from earlier. Oh. I can't sleep. I was thinking about Mr. Charles. What do you think he was thinking when those things ripped his arms off and nobody went to help him? He was probably thinking, "Oh, shit, they fucking ripped my arms off." Do you remember when we were married and we said we'd love each other until the end of time? Do you still love me? Dean. Dana, I told you that I get caught up in my writing. I'm tired. I'm tired. Aren't you tired? I'm not. I'm bipolar. - Go back to sleep. - Okay. Ouch! ( rat squeaks ) You are a vicious little fucker. Lord, grant me the strength to do what must be and the knowledge to guide me through these difficult waters. There was someone in the apartment. The boy? A warrior. Did she possess the mark? The tattoo on her wrist? I don't know. Robert is with her in the apartment now. Go back and find the boy. Do what you have to do. It should be me. ( speaks in tongues ) She's not the one. Get her up. ( grunting ) Where are they? What the hell is going on? Where? Who? ( winces ) ( grunting ) ( panting ) Priest: You don't know. She doesn't know. Kill her. - What do you want? - Please, I'm a priest. - What do you want? - The boy. Como say what? The Antichrist. ( grunts ) ( growls ) - ( snarls ) - ( bones crack ) This was supposed to be our world. ( happy tune playing ) - Jesus, I'm sorry. - ( music stops ) - Don't say that. - No, it's okay. No, I mean don't take the Lord's name in vain. Sorry. I just meant I'm sorry for what-- you know... Well, you know what they say. You know about things that don't kill you and whatnot. No. Well, they say something. I tried to talk to him about it once, but he wasn't having it. I don't know how you cope. I don't. At least you had a family. You don't have a family? I've always been a loner. A friend used to say that was my lot in life, whatever that means. No, wait. I won't bite. Is that supposed to be funny? Please. Just a little, okay? He's completely absorbed with his computer again. It's like he's a slave and that machine is his master. Who does he think's actually gonna get a chance to read anything he writes anyway? - Really? He's completely forgotten about us, the way we used to be. Morris, you're probably my best friend. ( moans ) That's disgusting. God, Morris! Jeez, ew ew! Sorry. Morris, God! I think I shall try to sleep. Good night, Morris. ( coughs ) ( spits ) ( classical music playing ) Hey. I wanna talk to you. Where's everybody going? Aren't we having fun? Morris: You were having fun. We do not feel anymore. This is death. We just want to rest and you want us to dance. Do you not see how selfish that is of you? Your happiness is not ours. So we must go. I wanna go with you. You should not be with the undead. What do you wanna do today? I want to go out. - ( moaning ) - Maybe not. Guess we'll have to think of something else to do. I'm beat. Come on. It's nothing a little fix can't help. Okay. Okay, that's it. Morning comes and I'm almost finished. Not bad for a night's work. - ( knocking on door ) - Stanley: Stellie! Stellie, come on. Open the damn door. Stellie. Stellie! Stellie. Stellie, come on, open the damn door. Stellie, Stellie, open the door, come on! Stellie! Stanley: What the hell are you doing out of your room? Stellie, Stellie. Stellie, baby. Did you drink from her? I'm glad you're back. You see, I don't think she's strong enough to continue on. Is she gonna die? Of course she's gonna die. But I don't think that's the question you should be asking. What you should be asking is: how are you gonna spend the rest of the time you have left? I'm gonna kick your motherfucking-- You bloodsuckers are all the same. What happened? She escaped. Michael's dead. She protects the boy. Where? A gated community in Culver City. We need to go now. The boy must die. ( speaks in tongues ) I will not fail you. I love what you've done with the place. She tried to lead you to your death. Yeah? I'm not your enemy. Yeah, but you messed with my feng shui. ( bones crack ) Nigga, please. Don't run. I don't run. Good. - Are you gonna kill me now? - No. Kill you? No no. I like you. And I need you. You need me? I need an unclean vessel to bring my father to this mortal coil. To bring your Armageddon to completion. Our what? - I'll never be a part of-- - Wait, a part of what? What the hell are you talking about? Armageddon, the zombies, your plan to end the world. End the world? Why would I wanna do that? I'm here to save it. Have you ever looked around at this world? Before, I mean. Lying, cheating, murder, terrorism, fast food-- we don't want it to end. Then who? No, he wouldn't do that. Wouldn't he? Ever hear of the Great Flood? A dude named Noah? I hate to break it to you, princess, he has. Why don't you ask your robed friends outside? ( snarling ) They're here to make sure their Lord's plan comes to fruition. To make real. - They're coming. - ( snarling ) Jesus, they're swarming. Can't you do something? Twitch your nose, snap your fingers? It doesn't work that way. I'm a physical being. Yeah, well, let's get physical. We're doing the right thing. I'm just protecting what's mine. - When they get in-- - Don't worry about it. - ( glass shatters ) - Fine. ( gunshots ) You are quite a warrior. Has someone been in here? Besides the zombies? Your girl was in my stuff. That's my stuff, my stuff. I didn't go through her personals. Marcus: True enough. Heather: How are you doing, bucko? Marcus: I've had better days. All right. Come on. - ( gun clicking ) - A little help here. - ( Marcus grunts ) - ( zombies thudding ) That's awesome. Do you cook? Not so fast. ( snarling ) Natalie: You're weaker. Another day, you won't be able to move. Another day after that, you'll be dead. Somebody's angry. Now this is what a smart girl would call a symbiotic relationship. Feed feed! Feed! That's it. That's it. ( laughing ) That's it. Good boy. Good boy. That's it. That's it. Good boy. That's interesting. ( ragged breathing ) I'm so sorry, baby. She's not looking too good. Looks like you're gonna have to pull double duty today. Fuck you. What did I tell you about the language? Hmm? What are you? Does it matter? Would knowing matter? Hmm? Drink. Drink or she will. ( coughing ) You can bleed yourself. Why keep us alive? A girl gets lonely in an apocalypse. Till tomorrow. Father, bless this blade and guide its path so that the cleansing can continue. ( Heather grunts ) You can't stop it. - ( grunting ) - ( squelching ) You did the right thing. I guess we'll see. Oh, come on! You ain't got no life left. Take mine. You guys are awfully quiet in there. Oh, man! ( screaming ) ( grunting ) No! ( feet squelching ) We're leaving. Where? I know a place-- sort of provincial-slash-Tudor. Are you ready? ( gasps ) Dana, Dana, get up! No! Fuck you! Machete. ( gasps ) ( screams ) Little help! Little help! No! Help! Stellie: After everything I still don't have no answers. What happened? Well, I guess in the end it doesn't matter how we get here. What matters is what we do while we're here. And what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna kill me some motherfucking zombies. ( zombie snarling )
