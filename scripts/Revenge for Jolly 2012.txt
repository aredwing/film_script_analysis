I woke up, combed my hai, drank some beer and played with Jolly. My dog, Jolly. I loved her more than anything in the world. Look, it's a bunch of bacon on TV. It's a little ham on TV, a little glazed ham. I'm not a bad guy. I'm a good guy but, I've done some bad things. Yeah, I understand. Well, what do you want me to say? I never lived a normal life. Never had a normal job. Never wanted one. You could say... You could say I had my own business. Hello? I did stuff. Hello? Sometimes business was goo, sometimes business was bad. Yesterday was one of those days. Fuck. Whenever stuff got soar for me... Jolly knew. She loved me. Sit. Things were about to get pretty ugly. My brain was like a washing machine. I had to get out of the house, so I went to see my cousin, Cecil. I never talk to a lot of people. People are hard to trust but I had to tell someboy what was going on. Cecil's a good guy too. He's got his issues like anyone else. He was just in the hospital again. Sometimes things get really hard for him when his head doesn't wok the way it's supposed to and he shuts down. He just shrinks away. Mary Ann is Cecil's girlfriend. She loves him a lot, she takes care of him. She knows how he is, he makes his mistakes, but she's always there for him. That's how Jolly was for m. Can we talk? Yeah. Mary Ann honey. Hmm? Come here for a second? Um, Harry and I just need a little bit of quiet time. Just me and him. Mary Ann? Yeah? This is the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It's so chocolaty. It's very, very chocolaty. I don't... I don't know how you get that much chocolate into one cake. Thank you. I am glad that you like it. I like it and thank you for making it for us. She great? She's so great. Yeah, she's great. Mmm-hmm. So what? What, what? What's wrong? I'm in a lot of trouble. No, you're not. They're gonna get me. What? Who? Who... Who's gonna get you? You know that thing I was supposed to do for those guys from Eddie's? Mmm-hmm. I couldn't do it. And now, they say I owe 'em. Hey, I owe 'em a lot of money. How much? A lot. Huh. Well, I could probably get Mary Ann to, to give me a couple hundred bucks if I ask her really nice. It's more than that, right? What are you gonna do? Leaving town. Tomorrow. I'm bringing Jolly with me. She's all I need and I don't care about anything else, so... You're gonna leave? Hey. You wanna get really drunk? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Everything's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. That's right. Can I have a little bit of my chocolate cake back? Yeah. Sorry. That's fine. I wasn't really finished. Okay. Sorry. I just... Yeah, I thought you were finished. Nah, I just felt... I was taking a break. Me and Cecil stayed up all night. Drank a lot of beers, played Candy Land. Usual stuff. I was just gonna pack a few things, grab Jolly and go. I didn't even know where. Figured, get there when I got there. No. No! Hello? What? Fuck. All right. Stay there. She... ...was the only thing that made me... You know, she... She knew how much you loved her. The man that killed her... I'm gonna find him. And I want you to help. Help me. Yeah. Of course. Is that everything? We'll make it right. Jolly's dead. The man that killed her t a thousand pins in my he. Nothing could make that kind of pain go away. And nothing could stop me from finding him. Fun? Sure. It's early. Even for you two. Yeah, two beers, Thomas. Please. Sure. Just put 'em on my tab. Uh, Eddie capped your tab, Cecil. Just put 'em on my tab. You... You don't have one anymore either. Yeah, I don't think that's gonna cover it. Well... Thanks. Somebody killed my dog. Killed? His dog. It's a little girl. She's dead. I wonder why somebody would do something like that. You do? I do. You... You wonder? Yeah. Hmm... Thomas, has anybody come by? Asked where I lived? Hmm... I... I, uh, I'm not... Um... Maybe. - No. - Maybe, or no? Yup. Yup, what? What the fuck are you trying to say? I'm trying to say that... That maybe there wasn't a guy. No. There was. There was maybe this guy. This guy... What about him? Thomas? Tell us about this guy. This one guy, Bachmeier. Comes in every so often. Last time he came in, he, he asked me if I knew where Harry Dennis lived. And you told him? Uh... Well, Eddie was here, too. And, and, and he... Thomas, why did you tell him? Why did you do that? Why'd you do that? Well, where can we find him? Bachmeier. I don't know. Huh? I don't know. He... He came in with Tina from the hotel. Tina fro... I know Tina from the hotel. You... ...shouldn't have told him where I lived. Hey. Relax. What? Relax. No, no, no! Wait, gun? Hey, Harry, come on. What are you doing? Just... We're friends. I'm your friend, right? Sorta. Just please, put the... Put the gun away. Please! Please? Harry. Harry, please. Harry. Harry. I mean, it's... It's just a dog, right? Oh, shit. Fuck. Just a dog? What kind of... Yeah, I know, I know, I don't know! Oh! I'm sorry. I realize that sometimes pets... Thomas? Thomas, you all right, buddy? Oh-kay. Okay, okay. Oh. Okay. Okay, okay. I'm gonna get some, some travelers. All right? Fuck, man. Oh, shit. We gotta get out of here. What happened? I was thinking, you probably didn't need to kill Thomas. I needed to. Well... I just, I didn't think we were gonna start this early. I figured that we'd... I don't know... Thomas? Maybe he was right. Maybe I didn't need to kill Thomas, but I couldn't help it. Too right now. I miss her. In "the thing" they gave us cats. Cats? Yeah. Something to care about. My little girl, Patty. I took really good care of her. I'd comb her hair. And I'd read to her. I taught her how to count. Every morning I'd wake up and she'd be half on my pillow, sleeping right next to me. And she'd crack open her eye just a little bit. And she'd just purr... And then one day I woke up, she was gone. Where'd she go? I miss her. Can I have a chip? Take the beers? Sure. We should carry our beer in a box or a bag. We? Can you grab that? Or a carton or something. I'm the one carrying the beers. Are you gonna knock? I'm a shitty knocker. I got the beers. Just knock. Fine, fine. No. Whoa! Tina. Come on. We got beers, come on. I don't want your piss warm beer. Do you have money? Uh... Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We've got money. Who's he? It's my cousin, Harry. It's all right, go ahead. Harry, huh? You don't look like a Harry. Why not? Your hair. It's... I like it this way. Do you have any friends? I could call Vicki. Yeah! Yes. Vicki. You're gonna like Vicki. This'll be good for you. I don't wanna have sex. You don't have to. Why, you don't like me? You're fine. I just wanna watch this. I'm having a bad day. Why? What? Why are you having a bad day? He's having a bad day because some piece of rotten fruit killed his dog. Bachmeier. You know him and he did it. Please tell us where he is. Sorry about your dog. You pay me for the fuck just now, you pay me for the fuck last week and I'll give you this fucking number. I thought you said the one from last week was on the house. You said that. It wasn't. Pay me! I can't, I... I'm saving up. Just fucking... Give us the fucking number, Tina. Mmm. Okay, okay. Wait... Is that real? I don't know. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second. Just hang, hang on. Wait here for a minute. Tina, why are you being such a fucking jerk? Are you crazy? Huh? Okay, all right! Playtime is over! Go put away your toys before I start getting really fucking... Oh, fuck! Fuck! Are you fucking kidding me? What the fuck... I don't like when people choke! Ow! Ow! Ow! Fuck! Am I gonna die? Vicki! Vicki! Vicki! She tried to choke me to death! And now you've... You've... You shot my good hand with your little gun. It was a warning shot! You aimed it right at me! How much do I owe you? Nothing. You just said I owed you a bunch of money for... No. No, it's good. We're fine, we're fine. Look, there's the number. She changed her mind. I changed my mind. Come on! I can't. I can't. Why... Why did you do that? You missed. On purpose! I'm... I didn't want to kill her! Fuck. Look what she did to my hand. It's my good hand. Hmm. Now it's my bad hand. Yeah. Fuck. I would've paid her. Now you don't have to. Harry... Could you get the beers, please? Law offices. You guys still on Butterstile Road? Um, down by the fluff factory? No, we're on Ashby, just north of Rumple Cre. We've always been on Ash, just past the creek ther. I don't know where the gas is. Where's the fucking gas? I really wish you didn't kill Tina. She's already dead. You should save your wishes. For what? Better stuff. Hit me. I'm hungry, are you hungry? Yeah, I guess. You know, Mary Ann's been cooking for me a lot. Every night she makes me dinner, almost every night. Yeah? She's very talented. And she's got a really good way with words. She wrote me all these beautiful letters when I was gone. What'd they say? Just that, you know... She missed me and I'm very handsome and stuff like that. How'd she say it? I don't know. Just... "Cecil honey, I miss you. You're very handsome. Then, I can't wait for the day you get out so I can see your handsome face every day. Hmm. She wants to go far away with me. Jolly used to watch me put together my puzzles. This one night she watched me put together a thousand piece puzzle. The Eiffel Tower in Paris. Yeah, I know where that is. Well, it was the Eiffel Tower in Paris at night. Whoa. It was all lit up and fountains on the ground and fireworks in the sky. She stayed up the whole night with me, and watching my fingers move everything into place. It was like we were on a journey there together, like piece by piece. And when the last one was locked in and my work was done, I made us bologna sandwiches to celebrate. She hated the crust, so I cut them off for her and gave her a little bit of beer and she ate her little sandwich. It was such a great night. That's very nice. Okay? Yeah. I'm sorry. We're closed. That's fine. Is there a lawyer? Somebody here named Bachmeier? Um... No, there isn't. But, um, we're closed for the evening. If you're looking for attorney... We're looking for Bachmeier. Tonight. I'll be back in just a minute. Bobby? A couple of guys out here. What? They're asking about Bachmeier. What'd they want to see Bachmeier for? I don't know. I don't know who these guys are. They won't leave. I'm trying to fix my VCR, I don't... Could you just come out here and deal with it? Fine. I will. Bobby will be right with you. This says that there's, um, there's a particular gene variant that's linked to those who resist marriage. You believe that? That makes sense. Hey. Bobby Fidazzo. Look, I don't know who you guys are or what you're doing, but there is no Bachmeier here. So, unless you have a legal matter that you would like to discuss with either myself, my brother, Danny, or Mr. Eichelberger, I suggest you fucking get the fuck out of here, all right? Door's that way! You know the guy. Just tell us where he is, Booby. I'm sorry, I... I thought I just heard you refer to me as Booby. Am I correct in thinking that? No. Yeah, what is it? We got a code blue over here. I was about to brush my hair. I know. I've just got Olive Oyl and Pablo Escobar out here. Yeah, they look like assholes. Right? Smell like assholes. Give me a second. You guys want some ice cream? Sure. Yeah? When we were kids, summertime, the ice cream truck used to park up the street from our house every night after supper. Every night except Sunday. Yeah. I used to beg my mom to let me get some ice cream. I said, "Mommy, let me get... Let me get a Bomb Pop, "let me get a creamsicle, let me get a little cone maybe. " She always said no. She didn't like to let us have sweets. Said it could rot our teeth, we could get cavities. Plus the infection. She said that it could get inside our brains. What is the point with the ice cream? You cannot have any. I don't get that. You don't get it? There's no ice cream here. This is a law firm. No, that's not... Ah, God. Fuck it. Forget it. Just go. Get the fuck outta here! Go! You're not leaving. All right. You boys should really go now. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. What do you two scumbags want? You guys ever look at these? The, uh, women's magazines? Cause they... I don't know, I think... They just... They get it right. They're on to us. Look at this. Look at that. Look at number two. Ah, fuck! My hand. Uh-huh. Today... Today's been a strange day. We've been to a few places, talked to a few people. Now we're here. We just want Bachmeier. He killed my dog. My little baby girl. And I'm gonna find him and nothing else matters. Nothing. Nobody. Never heard of him. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Oh! Oh! Harry. You okay? I'm fine. - What? What? - What the fuck? Motherfucker! What? What? What? You almost shot me! Somebody stabbed me. Where? It doesn't matter where. In the leg. Where? What the fuck? Okay, watch out. I think we got everybody. - Wanna get the light? - Yeah. Yeah. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Come on. Come on. Come on! Letter opener. Cocksucker! Fucking cocksucker. This is big. I wanna keep it. Sir, would you please tell us where this gentleman, Bachmeier, is? It would help us a lot and we'd really appreciate it. Never. That wasn't very helpful. No. What... What kind of dog was it? Miniature Pinscher. Oh... I love those. Fuck you and your little lump-a shit dog to hell! He wasn't gonna tell us. No. Lady. Where the fuck is this fucking guy? Just... Just tell us. Just tell us. I am not going to kill you. Lady, please. He's... Please. He's... He's, uh... He's at a wedding reception... Yeah. Tonight. Fausto's. Fausto's? Yeah. That's the one that looks like a castle? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Very good. You stabbed me. I was gonna shoot her, but Cecil already told her he wasn't gonna kill her. And he said if I did, I'd be making him a liar. He got really upset about it. I thought I was gonna lose him and I needed him. So, I decided to let her live. And I knew exactly what wod Cecil feel better. Still hungry? Let's get Mexican. Food. Yeah. Ooh, cheese enchiladas. Yeah. I love cheese enchiladas. Not as much as I do. Wait, wait. What if I'm in more of a burrito frame of mind though, you know? Mmm. And then I get the enchiladas and then I realize like... You wanted the burritos instead? Yeah. Have... Have you decide? Okay, okay. Um, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Uh... - Uh, 34. 34! - 34! - How could I not do it? - Mmm-hmm. How could not do it? How do I not order it? Have you decide? Ah, fuck. Fuck! I don't know, there's just so many good choices. Let's see. Bean burrito plate? Yeah. Oh. That's a really good choice. Thanks, man. I think so. Yeah. And can we have six more beers, please? Ole! Can you pass me a new beer? You have a new beer. Shit, I forgot. Um... Can you pass me another new beer? I'm gonna use 'em both. This is great. I'm fucked up. Me too. Should we smoke some more weed? Definitely not. Fuck it. Yeah! # I just did it I just did it # Geez. Big party. Shit. Where am I supposed to park? Over there? Is that a spot? Right there, is that a... Is that a spot right there? Oh, no. Yeah. Right in there. All right. Is it still okay? You got this, you got it, you got it. No, I can't, I can't. Now go. Go. Turn right. I can't! Turn right. I can't. Try! I can't do it! You have it. You can do it. I can't do it. You can do it. I can't try. You can't even try? No! I'm just gonna... I got it... No, you see... I'm not even saying anything. Just go straight back. All right. All right. Now go straight left. Okay, but there's... No, wait. Straight back or left? Straight left. Straight left? Yeah, yeah. And now hard straight right. Oh! Oh. That's okay. That's just paint. Paint? Yeah, it's just paint. Yeah, it's just paint. Just paint? What? Come on, another one? Wife! I got a wife! I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you tonight in the car. Okay. Oh... Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Did you see how narrow that spot was? The Fleetwood wouldn't fit. It was impossible! Well, then, you attempted the impossible. There's no shame in trying. Will you shut the fuck up? I'm just gonna go in here. I'm just saying that I... I admire the effort. Wedding reception. Whoo! I haven't been to one of these in a long time. I mean, I know we're not really invited. Just... These things are usually kind of fun. This will be fun. Gary knew just... You know, he knew just what to say to me. He said, "You gotta go out and find the love. " Oh! Since I wasn't finding the love at home. Now I might not have found the love that night, but, um... I did find some, uh... You know, I did have a good time with this girl named, uh... Oh, God, what was her name? I can't even remember... I don't remember her name. Just know that Angela and Gary will never sink as low as Jenny and I did because... Because, um... Because Angela's a hell of a girl. Aw... And, uh... And Jenny's just a filthy, stinking piece of crap... Oh! Yeah. ...who deserves everything I ever did to her. Sorry, kids, but it's true. Mary Ann wants to get married. I don't know. Sometimes I want to, sometimes I don't, I don't know. Right now I love her. If I was gonna marry anybody, it would have been Jolly. In India they marry dogs. Ward off curses, stuff like that. It makes sense. She was perfect. When this is all over, you want to go to India with me? Sure. What do I pack? Pack light. You're too good for that guy. You're too for Gary. You're too good for him. Look at him. Look at him. It's true. I'm just fucking with you, Gary. Yeah, I just wish I had gotten in there. Just wish I had snuck in there once before Gary did. I'll take the big one. You can't. Your hand. No, I can handle it. I was gonna take the big one. Come on, just let me have the big one. Fine, I'll take the two little ones. Yeah, take the little ones. Whoa. Cool. Handsome. Think so? Yeah. Thanks. You think we should lose the hats? Sombreros. Do you think we should lose the sombreros? Uh... Uh... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, this is it. This is it. Yeah. Let's get this motherfucker. Yeah. You ready? I'm ready. Shit! What the... Please don't scream. We haven't killed anybody yet. We don't have to kill anybody, but we might. We might! Especially if they act like a bunch of fucking jerks, and don't cooperate! Now, we came here... They have some garlic bread. You want to continue? Yes. Sorry, I got hungry. We just ate. I said I'm sorry. Okay? Somebody in here did a bad thing. He did a very bad thing. And we came... Which one of you is Bachmeier? Raise your hand. The Bachmeier. Fuck. There's a shit-ton of Bachmeiers here. Who are you looking for? The one that killed my dog. Nobody here is leaving until the man that killed my dog admits it. I want a confession. I want to see his eyes. Fuck you, asshole! No, no, no. Come on, come on, come on. It's just ranch. But she got it all over my boots. I know. And it's on my jeans too. What the fuck? You can't just go and throw ranch at people! - Ranch? - You can't. - No. No! - No! - You can't throw ranch! - It's okay. We're gonna wipe 'em off later. All right? Okay? All right. Fuck. You see? Stop, please stop! Please, just stop! You're looking for my brother, okay? He's not here! Why is he not here? Well... Why is he not here? Because our family is... It's dysfunctional. Put it like that. I still love you, baby. Sir. Fausto. Fausto. Fausto? This your place? It's very nice. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Fausto, can I... Um, could you get me a beer, please? Sure. Is that okay? Whatever you have is fine. You motherfuckers picked the wrong... Tony! Fuck it. Tony? Tony. You fucking dicks! This is my wedding reception! This is our wedding reception. You know what I mean. Where's your brother? Don't you tell him, baby. I know where he is and I'm not telling. Why don't you bitch pussies put down your fucking guns and fight man-to-man? You just call us bitch pussies? Yup. Give me a... A minute here. Gun. Hand-to-hand, man-to-man, the old fashioned way. I love it. I'm gonna enjoy this. - One handed. - Forgot to mention... Former Garfield High Bronze Gloves champ... Bitch-ass. You broke my nose. You broke my fucking nose. Gotta stick with guns, you big pussy. Hey, Gary? Yeah? Jesus Christ! I could've handled that. We gotta do it! Come on! I was gonna kill him with my own hands. Cecil! No! Uh... Your brother? He would've killed you for that. The thing you people don't realize, is that we... Should we... What? Should we finish him off? Oh! Oh, fuck, I'm freaking... I'm freaking out. Oh... God! God, somebody help! You're looking for Everett? Everett lives on Old Goose Road. Little white house, top of the hill. So there you go. Something to know about Everett. Everett handles delicate business. It's his bread and his butter. It's an awful thing. A man killing another man's dog. But I am sure he's been put to task on that there. I don't have an inkling what kind of predicament you fellas got yourselves into or who it's with, but I do hope this bloodshed stop real soon. Sometimes the hands get so dirty, no amount of washing can ever get 'em clean. Even never comes. Thank you. Bye. Will you turn the music back on? This is beautiful. Reminds me of Grandpa. Like him and Grandma dancing together when they were younger? Yeah. How much they loved each other, how they looked at each other. Smiling, their eyes. I wish... Hmm. Mmm-mmm. Thank you for helping me. You don't need to thank me. I do. I'm thankful and I want you to know. I know. He's in there. Killed a lot of people today. I'm gonna take it from here. What? It's my thing now. I've been going with you the whole way. I know. I thanked you, but this part's mine. What am I supposed to do? Hmm? Stay in the car. No, I'm coming with you. Really? Yeah. Stay in the car. Remember when I told you that I wasn't a bad guy? Well, it's true. But sometimes good people do bad things, especially when you push 'em. Today I got pushed, and I pushed right back. But the day isn't over yet. Are you Everett Bachmeier? Yes. You killed Jolly. Come in. Cookie?
