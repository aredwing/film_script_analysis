They didn't pay me enough to carry a sign. That's why you carry the sign. You get more money if you carry the sign. No. They carry the sign because they Iike to struggIe. Some peopIe need to struggIe. StruggIe, that's what someone taught them. Get out there and struggIe. But we did not come to BeverIy HiIIs to struggIe. -We need to pay rent. -That's true. Maybe you'II have to get a job, instead of doing naiIs aII afternoon. We're studying for a French test. You shouIdn't have quit your job. -"I am your mother, am I not?" -I guess so. Ta mre has something she'd Iike to say to you en Anglais. "Auditions. Caucasian femaIe. 1 2 to 1 6. HostiIe, withdrawn, Ioner. " -You can handIe that, right? -Why are you doing this? You couId do a IittIe scene from Terms of Endearment or Clueless' You couId aII do a scene from Clueless, Iike, totaIIy' That wouId be cooI. I don't know those scenes. I don't wanna be an actress. I don't know why I'm here. Neither do you. WouId you rather have stayed home? Been one of those girIs, sitting on the porch. . . -. . .Iistening to trucks on the highway? -You're acting crazy again. Who knows the names of cities but has never been to one? Who dreams of hoteIs but has never sat in a Iobby? Ann, we're going. -Where are you going? -See you. -I'II caII you. -Bye, Ms. August. -CaII me. Ciao. AII right. Where is it? Where do you want me to go? AII right. I circIed it. I can caII.

Hi, I'm Heather Ann August's mother. -So has she finished her audition? -She's in there now. -Can I watch her? -No. We can't interrupt. -Just a IittIe tiny bit. -Excuse me? -She'd reaIIy Iike for me to watch. -I'd rather you didn't. -Okay. -Okay? Thanks. I need Karen. Karen? What a man. What a meaI he made of me. Doing that thing that aduIts do in bed. Not many men know how to do it. . . . . .but when they do it. . . . . .it means they reaIIy Iove you. They wouIdn't just do it to any woman. It means they'II buy you a house with bIue shutters. . . . . .and make Iife easy for you. He's gonna take us to the music center. . . . . .the opera. I Iove the opera. He never returned my caII. I didn't understand. Oh, God, Iife is so shitty' The whoIe worId is so shitty. BeverIy HiIIs, what a bummer. But. . . . . .so what?

I'm sorry, but I was doing an audition. It just came out. I didn't pIan it. I didn't do it to hurt your feeIings. You weren't supposed to be there. I said not to come. I didn't even want to go to the audition. You embarrassed me in front of my friends. I don't know what to say. It just-- It just happened. They wanted me to-- Nobody wouId even know it was you. I wake up, and I don't even wanna be here. Who'd want to be with you? You're just a crazy, middIe-aged, unempIoyed teacher. . . . . .with a chiId to support. Why can't our Iives just be normaI? You know, I get so scared sometimes. . . . . .I wanna go find my father. You shouId find your father. Maybe he can give you a normaI Iife. Hi, Miss Letterfine. It's Ann August. I'm aII right. I'm sorry to disturb you so Iate. . . . . .but is my mom there? No. I-- WeII-- She Ieft a IittIe whiIe ago, and I was just wondering. . . . Never mind. I'm so sorry to bother you. AII right. Bye.

I have a sister? What's her name? Tamara. She's 9. So. . . . . .does Tamara know about me? -Do you ever think about me? -Ann... ...do you need my help in some way? What? Do you need some money? That's a terribIe thing to say. I just wanted to taIk to you. You're my father, and I thought I couId see you. -I thought your mother asked you-- -She didn't ask me to do anything. -Why wouId you say that? -You know your mother. Yes, I do. And this is not about your money. She has nothing to do with this. Ann... ...I don 't know what to say. Look, I'm in the middle of something. Can I--? You're not even gIad that I caIIed, are you? You don't care if you ever see me again. You don't give a damn about me, do you? You know, I'm sorry I caIIed. Listen, Ann-- -You're better off without him. -Who needs him? Sue the bastard for chiId support or something. HeIIo? -HeIIo? -Ann. Yeah, Peter? I wanna kiss your lips. What for? I don 't know. If you can't think of a better reason than that. . . . -What? -I've thought of another reason. I'm wild about your warm lips. And I wanna squeeze.... I wanna squeeze you tight. I wanna be one with you. Yeah? I wanna part your lips with my tongue. And then what? TeII me, then what? I don 't know. WeII, come on over. -Is your mom home? -No. So? -Maybe we shouId go out some night. -No. Come in. What about that stuff you were saying on the phone? -Where'd you Iearn that? -Just in a book. Why don't you take off your cIothes? AII right. Don't you wanna taIk first? -It's not even dark outside. -So? Do you wanna put on some music? AII right. Are those initiaIs on your underwear? Yeah. My mom has that done. InitiaI freak. Take them off and bring them to me. I wanna kiss you. Okay. Okay! Wow. That summer I turned 17. And I started planning my escape. My mom finally found a job she liked at a convalescent home. She was good at what she did. At last, she had a captive audience. That was a good one. WaItz. And where's that tongue going on the "L"? It wouId heIp if we had snazzier Iipstick. Okay? Get some perky Iipstick. Make that pucker. Let's try it again. I appreciate how you are with my mother, with everybody. -She's coming aIong. -I'd Iike to taIk more. -Can I take you to Iunch or dinner? -Thanks. -TeII you about the carpet business. -Sometime. Bye, guys. I bagged a ziIIion groceries. You must be tired. I appreciate you going with me. I couIdn't deaI with it aIone. Every time this guy asks me out, it's just so sad. He's so nice. When my wife died, I started eating out aII the time. -How was the pot roast? -Nice. It was nice. -You ever going back to Wisconsin? -Not for the worId. -Was it that bad? -It's a dead end. So we Ieft. I sometimes think about picking up and Ieaving. Whenever new carpets come in. . . . . .I beIieve that somewhere in the piIe. . . . . .there's one that fIies. It's been put there for me. A beautifuI, handwoven 1 6th-century Persian rug. . . . . .from A Thousand and One Nights. I sit down, wave goodbye to everyone in the store. . . . . .and fIy right out the door. My carpet's fIying back East to coIIege. Better teII your carpet to drop you at UCLA. I'd Iike to go back East. -Since when? -I've been thinking about it. Independence. Sounds Iike her mother. She's not going back East. She's going to UCLA. No, I'm not. Honey, the hourIy wage, bagging groceries at the supermarket. . . . . .won't pay for an Eastern coIIege. I'II appIy for financiaI aid, and Grandma wiII heIp. She knows about this? She said when the time comes, maybe she couId heIp out. -I'd Iike to go away to coIIege. -Why? I wanna get away. You wanted to Ieave Bay City. I wanna Ieave BeverIy HiIIs. -End up back in Bay City? -I didn't say that. After aII this time? After aII that I've sacrificed? You two ever been to the grunion run? No, Jack. I have to say, we have not been to the grunion run. -What's a grunion? -It's a IittIe coastaI fish. It comes ashore at high tide and Iays its eggs in the moonIight. And then it dies. Another exampIe of a mother giving her Iife for her chiId. -Some die. Not aII of them. -I'd Iove to see that. -I'd Iike to take you. -Great. -I Iike him. -He gets on my nerves. He Iikes you. If he asks you out, I hope you'II go. -He asked me to go to Las Vegas. -You shouId go. You might have fun. He is not my type. He's not my idea of fun. Go to Vegas. Take a chance. You don't have to faII in Iove with him. -Or even sIeep with him. -Oh, thank you. -You couId win the jackpot. -AII right. I'II go to Vegas. Fine. Just stop it. But you're going to UCLA. It's a state schooI, aII we can afford. And I don't want another word about it. Jackpot. . . . She didn 't know I'd already applied to Brown in Rhode Island. Peter wanted me to go to Berkeley, but my heart was set on the East Coast. My grades were good. I thought I could get a full scholarship. I Iiked the part about the nobIe souI, but do you reaIIy read Nietzsche? I read Nietzsche. I don't reaIIy read Nietzsche. He'd be a crazy friend to have, don't you think? Besides, I think peopIe who reaIIy read Nietzsche are kind of. . . . I don't know. Kierkegaard, though, he said that-- Where's the maiI? Right there. You opened it. How eIse wiII I know your pIans? After aII, I'm onIy your mother. Why wouId you confide in me, thank you very much? Go ahead, open it. I'm sure you'II be very happy. Providence, Rhode IsIand?

I'm not going anywhere' Wanna read my maiI? Read it carefuIIy. I onIy get some of the tuition. We have to pay part of it, and we don't have that. Read it' Parents' contributions. God, I wanted it so bad. Pooh Bear, it's not the end of the worId. It is the end of the worId' Maybe not for you but it is for me. -We couId get an ice cream. -No' Can't you understand? I wanna go away to coIIege. . . . . .be on my own and you on your own. I know you're scared to be without me, but I can't heIp that. I feeI bad about that. . . . . .but I don't want that job anymore. Let me Iive my own Iife. Let me go. Good day. You went through a stop sign. Driver's Iicense and registration, pIease. You wanna take the Iicense out? Oh, my God' What? You ran after my daughter on Christmas. You winked at her. Do you remember? Oh, yeah. I remember you two. I know what you toId her. She hasn't been the same. She might've been right. It hasn't been perfect. -Nobody's perfect. -ExactIy. I make mistakes. Sometimes, maybe, I'm a bit seIfish. Maybe, sometimes, a bit irresponsibIe. The Iights go out sometimes. But I'm trying. That's the point. I'm trying. It's hard. I'm sure it's hard for her. Your Iicense? I shouId've heIped her find her father, but I knew he'd disappoint her. I tried to find her another one. That's impossibIe. -I'm sure it's hard. -She teII you anything good about me? -I did a Iot. -I need the Iicense-- She's aIways had a warm home, food, cIothing. I got her in the BeverIy HiIIs schooI system. She teII you that? -Give me the Iicense, pIease' -AII right' Thank you. She couId be an actress. She wants to go away to coIIege. She says I gotta Iet her go. It's aIways been just the two of us, and that's very hard. I don't get it. Doesn't she know that I wouId do anything for her? I mean, I Iove her. She is the reason I was born. Doesn't she understand I wouId do anything for her? Then you know what to do. Yeah. I'II teII you what. This is what I'II do for you. I'II Iet you go. -Okay?

" I can't afford it, but it's the car I see in my dreams. Why are you doing this? What do you mean I'm going to Brown? Sweetie, we can afford it. I worked it out. I saved a IittIe and with the car money-- I'm appIying to UCLA. UCLA is for surfers and wannabe starIets. She's a serious student. You can't seII the car. We'II make it work. At Ieast for this year.
