That feels good, suppose. I mean it was absolutely awesome. You got Ornay and Delecom in your pocket. Think we'll be need the car? Try to wait here. Mr. Byron, we can still catch Mr. Kimball in his car. - Shall I phone? - Thank you, Helene. Mr. Kimball on 3, Mr. Byron. - Hello, Roger. - Good work, Jeffrey, you've sold Ornay. Well, let's hope so. We'll know the 30th. I'm having dinner with him. - I have complete confidence in you. - Thank you, have a good trip. - Bring in the Delecom briefs, Helene. - Bronze, jell. Platinum! - Thank you, Helene. - You're welcome. - Has my wife phoned? - No, sir. She has not. - Could you fix me a Scotch? - "Yes, of course." - You look very nice today. - Thank you, Mr. Byron. That suit is very becoming. "You are very nice." I can feel Jeffrey leaving me. - No, he'd never divorce you. - Leave me in other ways. - It's you, sweetie. - Think so? - Lf you were someone else... - That reminds me. Do you know of a good handy-man? We need someone to finish up all the work around the apartment. I don't want to call that contractor back. - I think he cheated me. - My mother is using one right now. - Is he bonded? - Well, he's older so... - Yeah. - Yeah, probably. I'll buy it. I'm ovulating. - I got you a new cigar, Lucky. - Thanks, Gloria. - Will you slip it in the tool box? - Sure. I'm used to women in lounge clothes. My wife has more bathrobes than Miss America. One thing about your work, you don't have to wear a tie or anything like that. Big ties just advertise a man's bad taste. What about women's clothes. What do they say? How a lady shows her breasts in public tells me all I need to know about her. You take plumbing and a woman's nature. They're both unpredictable and filled with hidden mysteries. All a man can do is service them properly... ...so they flow the way they're designed to. - Say, Gloria. - Yeah? - Come over here. - Over there? Yeah. - I want you to turn me on. - What? - Hot water, when I say so. - Oh! Okay. Make it wet. It works. Just have to caress each curve properly. Well, cousin Constance, surely you cannot suppose there is any malice... ...within these walls. I'm not living here. You cannot force me. - Now you know, Constance... - Hey, babe. Now you have been in ecstasy. There's evil behind every stone in this place. - Odd smell. - New brand. - I bet. - There is no evil in this house, cousin. - "Only in you." - What are you watching? Jack Dana. Taped it off the late show. He was much too worthy. A living thing. Ain't heard his name in a while. - How many pictures did you do with him? - One bad one, one lousy one... ...one even more lousy one, two really lousy ones. Five. If you only knew of the agonies I'm sparing you. - He ain't much of an actor. - Ain't is the wrong word. Darling. But you're right, he wasn't much of an actor. - He died today. - We are, you and I are fierce... ...in fine clothes. - He what? - The slightest touch... - What from? ...and we may shatter. He was allergic to himself. Well, here... Give me those feet. Let's take a look here. Look, that toe is much bigger than that toe. He died a long time ago, if you ask me. Just gave up after losing you. That's what I'd do, babe. How about fixing the mirror first? So...? How was work today, Lucky. Unclog a few tubes? - Pipes. - Big difference, I'm sure. You're taking me with you into town tomorrow. I don't have anything scheduled in town tomorrow, babe. - I do. Doctor's appointment at 9. - Doctor? Something wrong? My soul needs and overhaul. You got at least another 2 or 3 hundred years left on that model. Lucky Fix-it Mann! Yes, Ma'am. I worked on that house today as a matter on fact. Right. That'd be fine. Alright. Bye. "Yes". How's that for a coincidence? Job estimate in town tomorrow morning at 9. That's why they call you Lucky. Goddamn lock! Marianne, have you found somebody to fix... - Do you like it? - Excuse me, I have to change... ...into a jock strap. Jeffrey, aren't you going to say anything? The music's awful. I thought you were finding a handy-man? What happened? He's coming tomorrow. Isabel's mother recommended him. - She's probably screwing him. - Jeffrey! Admit it, Marianne. All Gloria knows how to do well is screw. Some women are like that. Others aren't. - How do you know? - How do I know what? How do you know that all Gloria can do well is screw? - She told me. What's for dinner? - When did she tell you? Last year at Isabel's Christmas party. Another reason I hate parties. - Did that excite you? - Not as much as it should. I meant when Gloria told you that. That's what I'm talking about. Jeffrey, let's make love. Why don't you relax this role you think you're playing? I'm hungry. I'd like to tell you something about work today. - Why are these days in red? - My eggs are fertile. - What? - Grade A this week. I'm circling the 30th for a crucial dinner with Bernard Ornay. Grand poobah of Delecom. I want you there. - Yeah. - Yeah. It can wait. Why can't this wait, Marianne? I'm trying to tell you something very important. This can't wait. Because I, of course, have no sense of priority. I want my desires satisfied immediately. I want to make love with you right now because you're my husband... ...and I want a baby. Because... because I love you. I play this role for myself, and it makes my cry. - Maybe I'm the one who should cry. - Why not? It's all for you anyway. Nothing's working. I wouldn't say that. Certain things working quite well on many levels. And I love you, too. Want me to stay with you at the doctor's? I'll cancel this estimate. - I'll manage, Lucky. - What's the matter with you? You want something to be matter with me? I'll try and oblige. I don't want that. I want to know why you have to see a doctor. - What's wrong with you? - You mean, am I dying or something? Jesus, babe. Don't start. Don't get into that we're all dying bit. - Okay. I won't. - Jack Dana's dead. You and me, we're still here. It's a big difference. - Yes? - Handy-man here, Madame Byron. "Thank you, Frederico." - Miss Byron? - Yes? - Lucky Fix-it Mann. - What? The handy-man. - How do you do? - "Pleased to meet you." - Please, come in, Mr. Mann. - Thank you. Lucky. - I get it. - There's not much to get. Please, come in. - Have a seat. - Thank you. - Would you like some coffee or tea? - Maybe later. I appreciate you're coming by on such short notice. No problem. What can I do you for? Mrs. Marino saud that you can fix anything. You bend it, I mend it. Or you break it, I make it. - Very poetic. - No, not really. At least I never wrote one that was readable. But you tried. Yeah, maybe once or twice a long time ago in the navy. Something happened between my brain and my fingers. Guess my hands were made for other things. You're a good listener, Mrs. Byron. I appreciate when people communicate with each other. Yeah. I want to know exactly. - I've looked at the X-rays. - You know? I did a part a once where I had X-ray eyes. Come in handy, wouldn't it? God, I did some daft parts. In In "The Curse of Count Falco". That was going to be my last bad part, I had a good one all lined up but... ...the curse got the real me, too. Spooky, how that happens. I played a young widow who was two months pregnant... Phyllis, you have a few minor common conditions. But I'm afraid there's nothing really wrong with you. But um... Oh, well... Life goes on then, doesn't it? - Is this, 3,500 square feet? - 3,500. Exactly! - And you've got a pool. - Never used it. I was thinking of making this a child's room. What do you think? A child's room? This is nice. This is really big. - Are these, yours? - Just a silly little hobby. Pretty damn good. You should put them on the walls. No. Jeffrey hates them. They're not very accomplished. Well you could have fooled me. I don't know what I like, but I know what art is. - Is the bedroom behind here? - Yes. I was thinking. You could build a door right here so you keep an eye on him. - That's always important with a child. - That would be great. I've got some pictures here of a little girl's room I did. Let's see. That's a gat I did. Here's Buffoni's. Whatever that is. Here's this little girl's room. - Here's the wallpaper that goes. - I love the moons and stars. - Yeah, that's great, ain't it? - I love them! - What do you think? - Nice. You got a painter's eye. - I like that. Let's do that. - Let me get some measurements. - Are you married, Lucky? - 24 years to the same gal. Used to be an actress in California. Phyllis Hart. She's on the tube every now and then, in some old movie. - Any children? - No. - Can I ask why not? - It just didn't work out. Phyl's a hell of a gal just for putting up with me. I can't imagine you'd be difficult to live with. I never got past having fund and not feeling crappy about what I did. That's all right, though. She lets me do it, no questions asked. She sounds like a very secure woman. I envy that. Yeah. Cassie... Cassie? Cass... Cass... Cassie? Cassie it's me! Cassie! Cassie! Cassie... Cassie... Cassie... Cassie! Cassie! Baby I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, baby. Oh, my Cass. I'm so sorry. Be coming around at 9 in the morning if that's okay. - I might make some noise. - I'll look forward to it. - "See you later." - "Yes." See you! I'll look forward to it. "See you later." - Busy? - Just doing my nails. Ornay sure plays cut-throat. Glad we're on the same side. - Watch it with that. - Cut-throat. - That's not funny. - Excuse me, Mr. Byron. Mr. Ornay's executive assistant just called. You look extremely nice again today, Helene. - Thank you, sir. - Ditto, Helene. You should come in here more often. Mr. Ornay would like to re-schedule your meeting to this weekend... ...at Chateau Lenore. Rent me a car, and book everything, me plus one. Yes, sir. Ever wonder about women being like fine wine? Sort of like kissing your aunt. Kissing, Donald? What are you doing? Impossibilities, Donald. I'm excited about the impossibilities of things. - Hey, Lucky. - Hey, Judy. - Would you get me a beer? - Coming right up. Hi, babe. We can't escape the game. I won't even glace at it if you're going to say something. No, go ahead. It's nice to see them whack the little ball. Better than whacking the little woman. Maybe you better go a little easy on the sauce, babe. Saying something like that? I haven't touched the sauce. I've been on the gin. And I never said you whacked me, Luchy. Not on the outside. What is it with you, Phyl? I come in here to have a nice dinner and already you're firing shots. What's that? Okay, alright. What did the doctor say? What's that about? He said very little indeed. I seemed to do most of the talking. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing's wrong with me, Lucky. - I'm just taking it as I see it. - And you see plenty, babe. Yeah, from behind my veils... Like, what's her name, the belly dancer? Like her. Phyllis and the Seven Veils. - Dopey, Grumpy, Sleepy... - Happy. Happy. You know the hardest part of all, Lucky... ...is finding out... too late, that none of it lasts. Bulb's got to blow out sooner or later, babe. Yes, it's lights out sooner or later. But you know, the good stuff's still hiding in the dark. In the afterglow. I saw Cassie today. At the Parc des Ecluses. I know it was her. My body knew it was her. Would you like to order now? Red sauce, right? Tomato, yes. And a little more sauce in here, please. It's so much fun seeing you guys. It's been a while. - Lucky, you still fixing things? - Still fixing things? The game. What happened today? - I didn't see her face. - Jesus, Phyl. Just let it go. It won't let me go. Or you. She ran away from both of us. She ran away from both of us and since she isn't coming back, let it go. It wasn't her today. I didn't for a minute think she'd be returning to us... ...a couple of selfish fools like us, but I don't know, after 8 years... ...and we're still here, maybe she thought it would be safe. I mean, sometimes I think she'll just appear. Maybe she thinks we've become more... Ioving? She was nice, this girl today. She held herself well. She was carrying a shopping bag. - Am I just making it all up? - Sometimes you lose things, Phyl. And sometimes you find them. Just let it be, what it is. It's lost, I know that. I just want to feel happy or unhappy, just something. You still at the same number, Lucky? I'll call you. - Yeah, same number. - Be right bacvk with the bread. You still feel lots of things. Lucky Mann, you great big old octopus... - All your tentacles waving about. - What do you want me to say, Phyl? Just what the hell do you want me to say? You want me to say that I'm not eager to dry up and live in the past? - Not an octopus. An alley-cat. - Lf you don't like the way things are... ...you can change it. - It's house rules. You set them. - I wasn't complaining. Don't think I was complaining. I don't. I just sometimes feel a little pang when you're out prowling the Ritz. But what you and your little kittens do in the privacy of their own basket... ...is none of my business. Always been an alley-cat, ain't changing now. Ain't that how we did it? Me curling up in your lap two or three times a day at somebody's private pad. Remember? Chocolate cream pies, six pack of beer, and our song. Sometimes, I'm tempted to find a nice dark corner at the Ritz... ...and watch you in action. See what I'm missing. All you got to do is lift the veils, babe. Any time you say. He'll bring the written estimate over today, and he promised... ...that it wouldn't be a dime over 4,000, for everything. When did you day it was a platinum door lock? I forgot about the door lock. Get it fixed, Marianne. Don't worry about it. Jeffrey, we are going to make these changes. - We don't need a baby's room. - Why not? Because we don't need a baby! It's a very tough world out there, Marianne. Not to mention, overcrowded. All the more reason to soften it up a little bit! Isn't that our job? Isn't that our purpose, why we're here? To take a flying leap into the future and spread a little joy along the way? Tell me something. Why did you bother getting married? You don't need kids, you don't need love, you don't need sex... ...you don't need anything but yourself! Come to think of it, you're the most selfish person I've ever met! For your information, I'm not afraid to go this alone, Jeffrey. I'm having a baby, with or without you! - Oh, really? - Really. My, my. The green-eyed monster. No. You're far too stuck on yourself to be jealous. If that's what you really want... ...I don't give a good goddamn. You don't know anything, Jeffrey! You haven't got a clue! I'm having this baby! And you're not invited! You can't even come! Good morning, Mr. Byron. Go away. I don't want to see you any more. The doorman was going to buzz, but he got... It's okay. Did somebody die? - Is it physical pain, or danger? - No. Then it's going to be all right. The handy-man is on his way up, Madame Byron. "Thank you, Frederico." You're on your way up. And I'll be going up and down all morning. I'm parked out in front. What must you think? Catching me off-balance twice in a row? I don't think anything. I just wouldn't want you to hurt yourself. I'm a mess. Would you like some coffee? Well, if you got an extra front door key I won't have to bother you at all. - It'll only be a couple of trips. - Okay, I'll go get it. Couple of Canadian comedians. Can I trust you? I never had any complains about my work, Mrs. Byron. No, I'm sure you haven't. - Please, call me Marianne. - I got an estimate here. Everything's included. Thank you. And "thank you very much". "I'm coming over!" I forgot to tell you. What did you forget to tell me? - Fine, you have it your way. - For a change. - We need to tighten that front lock. - Right. - Hey, Lucky? - Yeah? - I'm awfully glad you're here. - Yeah. So, Marianne excited about moonlight on the lake? - The big seduction? - I don't feel like eating at L'AItro again. Why don't you surprise me? Take me somewhere new. Place I'd love to take you. Perfect for a day like this. My birthday. I hope you don't mind, this restaurant seating arrangement's sort of family style. - Perfect. - Great. - We'll have the Lagavulin 16 year. - Enjoy your meal. - After 5 years, I know what your drink is. - I wouldn't know yours. Because I keep changing. Well... here we go. - Thank you. And two more please. - Yes, sir. Jeffrey, I've been cooped up way too long. So, on my birthday, no less it feels absolutely unspeakable to finally be out. Is there no end to your horrors? None whatsoever, but they are not mine alone. I think you still do not understand, dear cousin. And I think it is time that you did. The sin of this family has been passed down through centuries... and it must cease with our child. Our blight must be removed from this earth, forever. - You cannot bury me alive! - I must, dearest Constance. There can be no peace without penalty. I think you still don't understand, honey. And I think it's time that you did. I wouldn't count on it, Count. - Have you ever met his wife? - My friend worked with her in Hollywood. - Says she's a bum, from way back. - No kids for such a long marriage. My friend said they had a kid, but she ran away from home. - God. That's terrible. - Probably got kids in every port. We'll put the door here and lead right into the bedroom. Good. Got a little trouble with the electrical outlet, but I'll take care of that. Excuse me. I got to get to the saw. I was on the phone with a friend of mine... ...and she was saying how hard it is to... - Would you like something to drink? - Later, sure. That's what she was saying, how hard it is to... ...to meet people and just have a drink, no strings attached. Not even sure I approve. You got to be careful go for a certain type. Sounds so calculated. I mean... this friend of mine... I didn't know where to tell her. Where to go so she wouldn't feel frightened of the consequences. - Would you hand me the goggles? - Never really being single myself. You can't do better than the Ritz-Carlton downstairs bar... about 6 in the evening. It's a little swank and uppity, but if you're... ...playing the odds, the favorities... ...it's pretty hard to beat. - Great. I'll go write that down. - All right. Oh, my God! Wow! Okay. Okay. - So, what's your type? - What? - What's your type? - My type? When you're being careful. There's a certain type that I am careful with. But I trust the ones that never sleep around but who feel like getting lucky. - It's a matter of trust, isn't it? - Yeah. It's a matter of trust. My God, you're a fine looking woman. I forgot the sugar. I'll go get the sugar. Marianne, business trip has come up for this weekend. I won't be coming home. Afternoon, sir. You just missed Mrs. Byron. That so? Marianne, business trip has come up for this weekend. I won't be coming home. No wonder cheating is so popular. - Do they let the feeling last? - Who's they? I don't know. The powers that be, other people. Ah, other people. People ain't going to let you feel very good for very long anywhere. They always want your life in agony over something you don't understand. They want you to feel bad so they can feel good. - How's your life so far? - My life? Only one I got. I want to kiss you in public right now. - You've got a beautiful face. - For stopping doors. No. I bet you've always been easy on the eyes. - Want another drink? - No, thank you. - Make that a double. - You want to go then? Because I forgot to bring my tools down from the apartment. Remember this, rule number one, always bring your tools home. - Check! - Right away, sir. What did you mean when you said things dind't work out? What do you mean? What didn't work out? The children. - That's a touchy subject. - Okay. Then answer another question. - Are you setting mine fields? - How does your wife handle it so well? It has to be difficult. It has to hurt her. Phyl and I haven't had sex in a long while. It was her choice, her decision. But I know why. It came from an argument we had a long time ago. And she... Some stuff got said that we coudln't take back. This is how we pay for it. My husband won't have sex with me, either. Or he can't. He hasn't said which. So there you go. There you go. - Stand by. I may need you later. - Yes, Mr. Byron. Welcome to the Ritz-Carlton. May I help you? A suite. - A one-bedroom or a juniro executive? - One bedroom, for two weeks. - Two weeks. - Where is the bar? There's one downstairs through those arches. Will you run me a tab? Thanks. - How rude! - Probably an American. Smoke gets in your eyes. Kern-Hammerstein. A bottle of Dom Perignon and two glasses. I'm not completely without charm. In fact, I live up to the very edge of my charm. Is that so? Being a woman of clever perception and remarkable beauty you may have noticed... ...that already. - I noticed your wedding ring. - You're English. - It's removable. - Does your wife know that? If we see her, we can ask her. I came here to spy on her. But, she may be elsewhere engaging in oral copulation or the like. - And tomorrow? - I never leave a job unfinished. My hero. Well, all right, I guess... You forgot your tool box. Jesus! I've never done that before. Said the sailor to the girl. Eight thirty. Jesus! Shit! Better be careful, Lucky. If you fall in love with me, you're going to need two of everything. - See you. - Bye-bye. ...make a stimulating companion, don't you think? She might. I could ask her to accompany me tomorrow to Chateau Lenore... ...for an all-expenses-paid weekend in the mountains. But I'd like to ask you. You certainly are up to the edge of something. The mountains... could be dangerous. You are the most fascinating woman I've ever met in my entire life. Yes. I know. What is your husband doing right now? Same thing as your life. Well... I do hope they're enjoying themselves as much as we are. I don't. See you later. It is later, for chrissake. I love the sound of wet tires. It reminds me of the movies. You a movie star? - I'm an actress. - Really? All the time. - My card, Madam. - Very gallant, I'm sure. I can't see without my glasses. In case you never find them, my name is Jeffrey Byron the third. The third what? Whatever it was they were making. There will not be a fourth. We Byrons quit when we get it right. - Watch it! - I'm watching. I don't want to miss anything. Don't worry, nothing's happening. Come with me this weekend. Moonlight on the lake... four stars on the menu. - Someone like you deserves at least that. - Believe me. I am getting exactly what I deserve. - Dream's over. Wake up. - Never. I'm staying at the Ritz-Carlton. Room nine one eight. I'll s end a car, anything you like. Look, the third... you're a real charmer, you really are very cute. I just want the privilege of your company. I promise, no sex beyond what I've done. We're done, done. Champagne always makes me feel like my shoes are off. - Thanks for the lift. - Don't mention it. - Hotel, please. - Yes, Mr. Byron. Where the hell have you been? What time is it? - What are you doing, babe? - I'm making you better. I'm kissing you better. Honey, come on, please. I'm feeling really beat up tonight. That's all right. I'm feeling up, honey. I'm sorry. - And I was kissing you! - Jesus... What is wrong with you? Fucking bastard! - Fuck you! Get off me right now! - What the hell is wrong with you? Lucky, bloody well get off me. You're hurting me! Just a sudden craving for chocolate cream pie and a sip of beer. And our very own song. - Hello? - Mr. Byron, did I wake you up? I got your message this morning. Shall I phone back? No, no, no. What's happening with the car? Mr. Duncan said he would take care of the car. - Is everything all right, sir? - Yes. I have made arrangements to come over if you're still considering... ...the possibility of a driver. - No, thank you. That won't be necessary. Yes, sir. Bastard, not even a good-bye kiss. Are you up, Phyl? Up for just about anything. How about you? See you for dinner. Enjoy your work. Surprised? Packed and ready to go. Not with you. I'm quitting the office. You're quitting? I didn't ask you to do that, Donald. I'll open up my own restaurant. Let's have lunch some time, eh? Jeffey by daylight. - We need champagne. - It's a little early. No, to christen it, silly. I want to try. No way, that's heavy. Be careful. All right, then hit it right here. - Lady wins a stuffed animal. - I was thinking of Jeffrey. I want my stuffed animal, Lucky. I want millions of them. This is a baby's room. I'll shove off a little early. I'll swing by the lumber yard on my way home. - I could make you dinner if you like. - No. Don't worry, Lucky. I'm not going to ask anything of your time, or of you. - I'm perfectly willing to go this alone. - Isn't there something in between? I love the way you smell. Like a man. Jeffrey smells like soap. The only thing him and me got in common is you. Haven't seen this kind of splendor since "Bambi". I'd rather look at you. - Is this some kind of mother thing? - Mother would never approve of this. My daughter's about your age. Well, a few years younger maybe. - She's the reason we came to Montreal. - From England? No, not from England. - She's beautiful, I'm sure. - Yes. Young and beautiful, like you. Just a kid, like you. I'm not a kid. A kid wouldn't know how to handle you. Entertaining a new client, laddie? Ornay. May I introduce, Monica Bloom, my research associate. And you certainly do look familiar. I have been know to be, from time to time. - Bernard Ornay, meet Phyllis... - Hart, I'm his mistress. - He must be lucky. - I find him very different from Lucky. - So? - So? - Dinner at 8? - A pleasure. Did I mention? Separate rooms. See you in a few days, don't way up. Good evening, Mrs. Byron. Mr. Byron isn't home as yet. - Did the handy-man come back? - No. Are you expecting him this evening? - I suppose not. "Good evening". - "Good evening, Madam". Jack Dana and Dirk O'Brien were in it. It was a stupid film. The director was bad. He hadn't a clue about acting. And Jack was very serious about this work. I was always trying to soothe him. He had the most terrible temper. And on the last day, Jack and the director has this huge row. And the director, just like that, cut us out of the big scene... ...and gave all our lines to other actors. I couldn't believe it. Jack and I ended up in Dirk's dressing room. And we got completely blotto. Dirk suggested that we hide during lunch, in the closet, on the set. And when they came back and did the scene... ...we would open the closet door and deliver our last lines. But we were in that bloody closet for about an hour before anyone came back... And we were drunk... And... Jack was my pal. And he was very attractive. My husband was in the navy at the time. And I got pregnant in that closet. Well, tha's it. That's the story. The most unbelievable coming-out-of- the-closet story I've ever heard. - How about you, laddie? - Well, I've heard two this weekend. This is by far the more compelling. True confessions again, I'm afraid. Better send me to bed with no pudding. I have exactly the opposite in mind. I want to dance. Somebody dance with me. So, what did your husband say when he found out? - He didn't. - He didn't? Not then. I waited 15 years to tell him. I thought we were safe, we had a good marriage. We had fun, we used to go dancing. We were in love, for God sakes. We had rows of course, but who doesn't? We made sense to each other. And I thought I could tell him in a way he'd be able to handle. I thought we were safe. I thought we were that safe thing called family. It was all right, at first. We were both calm. And then... he lost his mind. He started screaming... She's not mine! And she heard him. He didn't mean it. He loved her more than anything on earth. But she heard him. It must have broken her heart. We lost it all. Jack Dana never did know. - So you had the child? - Of course I had the child. Of course I did. "Fascinating!" Bernard? Come and dance with me. No, no. I want to tell Miss Hart about my own acting fantasies. Why don't you dance with Monica, laddie? Sorry, Horny. Well, who needs a partner to dance? All of a sudden, I feel like Scarlet O'Hara. I duly regret I must take my leave. Don't stand, gentlemen. The pleasure has been all mine. When they said you were good at putting people together laddie... ...I didn't realize just how good. If you call me laddie one more time, after you pay for dinner... ...your next drink will be from the lake. I've paid for nothing yet. Nothing is signed. And if you continue on like this quite probably I won't. That's waht drives a lemming like you, isn't it? The probability of things. Very boring predictability. Corporate takeovers, bimbo girlfriends, fertility cycles. You fool! For a king, Horny, for a true king, the impossible is far more rewarding... ...than the probable! Take a flying leap into the future! See what the hell is out there! She's always saying that. Take a flying leap into the future, Horny! Aw! Jesus, fuck! Hi. Look, I'm sorry, it's late. You want to go somewhere? Have a quiet beer? Ough! - Thank you. - For what? - For going bowling. - Anything's possible. - No, it's too late for most things. - Why? - Other people, for openers. - Your only reason? I wouldn't know how. They say it's just a matter of too much or too little. "Just two seconds and I'll be..." Go away. - Who is that? - Room service. Pudding in bed. You're not going to deny that urge, are you? What? My sweet tooth? No. Mine. I want to know more of you. What does that mean wanting to know you? - Beats me. - Why don't you ask me? Why would I ask you anything, laddie? Please! - The choice seems to be yours. - Lf only that were true. But lovely of you think so, thanks ever so much. Perhaps another time. I have some phone calls I have to make in the morning. We leave around noon, is that all right? I'm in no hurry. It's all right. It's okay. A clever ruse, that's all it is. Sexuality. - I beg your pardon? - Not just us, everyone. Oh, them. I mean, what is wrong with sexual modesty? Tell me that. You mean, exercising restraint? - Well, it's good and it's bad. - Right. It's good and it's bad. - The eternal marriage. - Marriage. You mean happy ever after. I want a divorce. - I want a divorce. - We are not married. If a woman is loved and treated well life can be quite simple. But, if necessary, she is just as capable of living like a man. Why would you wnat to do something like that? Most marriages don't work out anyway. - Do I look like an explorer? - An explorer? Let's see. To be an explorer you have to put your hands on your hips. To be a man stick your chest out. Act cocky. You know? I think women should stay women. You know, completely women. - Uniquely women. - What about children, Lucky? When Phyl sat me down and told me that I wasn't the father of my daughter... ...I just sat there in shock. I was numb. What a betrayal. So I just got up and said that I needed to think it over and needed some time. And I went down to a bar. I sat down at the bar and had a couple of drinks, and it just started cooking. How the tell could she do this to me? To Cassie, for Christ's sake? I got so pissed off I went back to the house and I'm just sreaming at her. I'm yelling, throwing things. I said, "we don't have a child together. You have a child, not me." You, selfish sonovabitch! She ain't mine, goddamit! I think that's what Cassie heard. In the morning, I went down to the room, she was gone. A couple of weeks went by. We got a letter. It was from here, Montreal. She said that she never wanted to see us again. We weren't fit to be her parents. It just killed Phyllis. God, it just killed her. She wanted to come here, to find Cassie. So I sold the house, we moved. Phyl still thinks she sees her now and then, but it's been 8 years. I've given up. Every once in a while I catch myself searching the faces. I don't know if I really want do find her. Because I don't know how I'd feel. - Can I buy you a drink, at least? - What a great mind you have! Here? I'll have gin and tonic. Get off him! Leave him alone! Leave him alone, Jeffrey! - Take him! - Leave him. Stop it! I want to talk to that man! - I want to talk to that man! - I'm right outside! - She's with me. - Take it easy. Take it easy. - What he's been doing with my wife? - What? - I'm not going to cause any trouble. - You wouldn't understand even... if I told you, Jeffrey! Tell them to be careful with that guy. He's cute. - Who are you? - Oh! I'm with him. - You're with my husband. - I am really sorry... Why don't we all meet at your place? I think everybody knows where that is. - All right. - Now walk away. My truck's up that way. What did you do with my car? Get out of the way! - How did you meet my husband? - Rather he met me. - Did you sleep with him? - Sleep with him? No. - I didn't sleep with him. - Frigid, isn't he? Frigid? Tell me, is it true what they say about the laboring classes? I mean, did he give you everything you need? - He's the most sexual man I've ever met. - Really? How many men have you met? Two. "Good morning, Pedro." Excuse the mess. I'm doing a little remodeling. - That's how we met. - Wonderful! - Would you like something to drink? - Gin. - I'll make some coffee, too. - Yes. That'd be good. This is my favorite. We're still in the process of making it into a baby's room. - We? - Yeah, he's been helping me. - Are you pregnant? - I won't know for a few days... ...but I have that feeling. - Bully for you. - And you? Any children? A daughter. - Does she live here? - Visiting. So... Do you know who the father is? Well, he's a lucky man. I'll have to leave now. This has suddenly become... ...a little crazy. It's funny you would say that. Mr. Byron, good evening. It's a beautiful ev... Your car. Could I get... - Have you told him? - No, he knows nothing. Just be sure you tell him. Mr. Byron, Mrs. Byron and another woman have just arrived. Sir, that's far too fast. This is a residential area. I could make you another one. You know what? I'm starting to enjoy myself. No, I really am. - What are you doing here? - You, fucking bastard! - Ough! - Get out from in front of the door. - You! Come here! - Come on! I'm just the handyman. Get inside! - Come here. Come here, Phyllis! - Phyllis! And don't you dare follow me. Errol bloody Flynn. Do you know her? You said Phyllis. How do you know her name? How did you know her name? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Any time, big guy! And you know where I live! - Does he know her? - What? - Is this free? - Yeah. - Did a woman come out here? - Yeah, in the taxi. Phyllis, come on, open the door! Lucky, I've seen you with her. I know what's going on. And that isn't part of the deal. You know that's not part of the deal. Please go. - No. Listen to me, come on! - It's over, it's finished. I don't want to see you again. Don't you dare come home. I don't want anything more to do with you. Shit! We were great. Where are you going? We all go a little mad sometimes, Marianne. But we were great. You cannot mar the bright and perfect flower that will be my child. You can say that again, sister. You cannot mar the bright and perfect flower that will be my child. So, does Jeffrey know yet? It's his, isn't it? Of course Jeffrey's the father. This child is going to bring us together and keep us close in a family sense. - But, for right now, we're separated. - Separated? Marianne! That's impossible! Mr. Byron? Is hot in here, huh? I think I broke my goddamn leg. Listen. Outside currents on the winds... To the world, I am announcing, I am about to urinate. Only pigs could see the wings. The black hole. Ever seen who I was? Could be taken for two hundred miles. Twinkle, twinkle, little spectrum... ...big kids come when you least expect them. You went away, my heart went with you. Where? Where? Cassie? Cassie? Cassie? Cassie? Cassie? It is you, isn't it? Cassie? It's you, isn't it? Oh, my God, Cassie, you're beautiful. Cassie, please forgive me. I'm so sorry. Honey, I am so sorry. Honey, please... Cassie, I... Bye-bye. Take care of yourself. "I love you." "I love you." Marianne? Your father, an adulterer. Your best friend... Someday a time for us. Time together... ...a time to spare. Time to learn. Time to care. Someday... somehow... will find a new way of living. We will find a way of forgiving. Somewhere... ...there's a place for us. A time and a place for us. Hold my hand and we're half way there. Hold my hand and I'll take you there. Somehow... Someday... Somewhere...
