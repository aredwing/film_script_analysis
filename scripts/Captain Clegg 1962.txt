Namely... that your ears be slit. No! And your tongue be cut out. And you be taken to the nearest uninhabited shore... with neither food nor water... and left to die. Mercy! Signed Capt. Clegg... this year of our Lord, 1776. "Praise he who made the sun" "Day by day his course to run" "For his mercies they endure" "Ever faithful, ever sure" "Praise him that he gave the rain" "To mature the swelling grain" "For his mercies they endure" "Ever faithful, ever sure" "And hath bid the fruitful field" "Crops of precious, increase yield" "For his mercies they endue" "Ever faithful, ever sure" Gentlemen. This will not do at all. We are gathered here today to give thanks to our Lord... for his bounteous gifts. Now, is this the best you can do? Surely not? I know some of you feel you have precious little to be thankful for... with taxation what it is... and war with France more than just a possibility... but you are wrong. For you have your health. You have enough to eat. More than enough, in some cases. You have roofs over your heads... fuel for your fires, a new schoolroom... a choir that sings in tune. Sometimes. And what is more... you haven't any King's men billeted in your homes. And so, my friends, let us have the last verse... no, the last two verses again. And this time, we'll really give thanks and we'll mean it, shall we? Are you ready, Mr. Mipps? "Praise him that he sent the rain" Brandon, get ahead with your cutlass. Aye, aye, sir. Well, we've a good hour yet. He said that parson liked the sound of his own voice. "And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel... "were gathered together to Mizpeh... "the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. "And when the children of Israel heard it... "they were afraid of the Philistines. "And the children of Israel said to Samuel: "Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us... "that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines. "And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering... "the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. "But the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines... "and discomfited them." Timed it just right, eh, Bosun? Can't think why we didn't come by road instead of this boat caper. He said they'd be watching for us on the road. This way we take them by surprise. Right, Bosun. Forward! Now... let us sing Hymn number 291: "Oft in danger, oft in woe." "Oft in danger, oft in woe" Right, Bosun. You know what we're looking for? Pitch to and find it. Brandon and Smee fallout. I'm going to the church to make sure none of the flock leaves the fold. Forward. Aye, sir. All right? Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. We're closed till after Church. Who says so? I say so. Mr. Rash, these gentlemen must have had a long walk. Give them a drink. All right. What do you want? Brandy. This is an alehouse. All right then, wine. We don't keep no fancy French wines here. The duty is too high. Don't keep any wine? We'll have to make sure, won't we, lads? Now, here's an answer to a sailor's prayer. What's your name then, my pretty? My name's lmogene. Imogene. I knew an lmogene once. Chased her for two years. Every time I caught up with her... she gave me the slip. Perhaps you were too rough with your wooing. Not for that lmogene: She was a three-master. A pirate ship, she was, boy... flying the black flag of Capt. Clegg. We've got him in our churchyard. Who? Capt. Clegg. He's buried there. You're welcome to him, boy, very welcome. I see I spoke too soon. The King's men are already with us. If you would care to join us in worship, Captain, you are more than welcome. But first, would you be kind enough to remove your hat? I would, sir, if I were here in the service of my Maker. But I'm not. In the service of my King, I keep it on. I had prepared a sermon for today on the text: "Blessed be the Lord my strength... "who teacheth my hand to war... "and my fingers to fight." However, under the circumstances, I feel it would be rather inappropriate. Therefore, I should suggest that you consider the service finished... and that you should go straight to your homes. Well, nothing there, matey. "Pitch to and find it," he says. Where? All I can show for my trouble... is splinters in my fingers and corns in my feet. My heart bleeds for you. Who's going to pay for all this damage? Why, you are, Mr. Rash... a right thinking taxpayer, you'd want to stop smuggling. So we're putting a stop to it. What more compensation do you want than that? The follow party arrived, Bosun? Aye, sir. But we've found nothing. What's in there? Mr. Rash? It's here somewhere. Unless that informer, Ketch, was lying, Captain. He was too frightened to lie. All right, Bosun, fetch your ferret. Aye, Captain. Unchain him. Look at this. So they've no fancy French wines, Captain? You two. Come in here. Come on. What's this? A hole in the floor, Captain. I can see that, fool. What's down there? Why, the cellar, of course. Why the concealed entrance? Well, it's an old inn. Get down there. No secrets here, Captain. Just tar for the nets, lamp-oil and the like. What's in that? White varnish. It's for the boats. Are you sure it isn't White Holland's Gin? Yes. Open it. He was speaking the truth, Captain. Here, Captain. Varnish? Varnish, Captain. Did anyone tell you different? There's a man here called Ketch. Do you know him? Yes, that'll be young Tom. I want to see him. That would... Take me to him, no arguments. After you. Come this way, Captain. They learnt anything? Only the taste of white varnish so far. At least that's all the Bosun has. If we don't get rid of everything quick... they'll learn the taste of brandy and gin. Listen. Captain, I should have told you, I was at sea myself for years. I've sailed around the world three times. Pirating? There you go, always suspicious. No. I was a ship's carpenter. Very good one. That's where I learnt my trade. Of course, it's a bit quiet here, after the high jinks at sea... but it has its points. What's down there? That's the coffin shop. But, Captain, you come here to see Tom Ketch, didn't you? Tom? Came in this morning, I haven't had time to touch him up yet. He was alive last night. How did he die? He was found floating in one of the ponds on the marshes. The Squire found him this morning, when he was out riding. Squire Cobtree. How did he die, man? Dr. Pepper signed the certificate: "Natural causes." But, I think from the look of the poor fellow, that he died of fright. That's more like unnatural causes, isn't it? Frightened to death? What by? Well, he didn't tell us, of course, being dead... but I think it was the marsh phantoms. The what? The marsh phantoms. People around here don't believe in them. Say they don't exist. That's during the daytime, of course. At night, if you ask them to go for a walk across the marshes... you'll find that they'll have something more important to do... like bolting the door and going to bed. Old wives' tales. I'm sure you know best, Captain. You say the Squire discovered the body? Yes. Where do I find him? He'll probably be in the church saying his prayers. Shall I take you? No, I'll find him. As you wish. Thanks, matey. You out of your wits? Bringing him here, risking all our necks? I brought him to pay his last respects to the swab that gave us all away... the late Tom Ketch. He's off to see the Squire now, won't be back for quite some time. We're getting rid of this stuff. Wait a minute. That's the best elm. I don't mind lending my coffins in a good cause... but I'm not having them smashed up. Lovely bit of grain. Throw the liquor in the creek. Smash up the kegs, get rid of it. By whose orders, Mr. Rash? By my orders. We were told to wait, Rash. We'll wait so long, we'll have a rope around all our necks. Get rid of it. Mr. Rash? Since when have you given orders? Well, I thought with all those... There's no need for you to think. I think for all of you. Is that clearly understood? As you say. Exactly. As I say... the goods will be delivered tonight, in the usual way: At midnight. What about the revenue men? There's a chance they'll be gone by then. Well, supposing they're not gone? I don't like it. I'm not interested in whether you like it or not, Mr. Rash. Just as long as you do as I tell you. You've been in this trade long enough to know we all have to take risks. It's all right for him. He's done very nicely out of it all these years. Yes, very nicely. He's taken all of his fair share... and squandered it on food for those who were hungry... and clothes for them that didn't have any. All right, Mr. Mipps. Now listen. Spread the word, the King's men will not get accommodation in the village. There is to be no room for them anywhere. Aye, sir. And remember, there is to be no violence, either. Aye, sir. Mr. Rash. I heard you. Then say so. Midnight then. He put you in your place properly, Mr. Rash, didn't he? No violence. Captain, admiring our little church? And you've removed your hat, I see. Are you no longer in the service of the King? I came to find the Squire. But I'm also looking for quarters for my men, Parson. Not in here, I hope. No. But you'll know the most suitable places. Yes. Have you tried the inn? Come now, Parson. There's only one room in the inn. And you have taken that, I expect. It's hardly big enough for all of you, is it? Let me see now. There's Mrs. Wagstaff's... No, she's just had another, hasn't she? Her thirteenth, I think it is. That would be little crowded, wouldn't it? And a little noisy, too, I expect. Would you mind holding this for a moment? Thank you. Dr. Pepper has a spare room... but he's been attending some rather nasty cases of the plague recently... so I couldn't really recommend there. No. I'm afraid the inn is about all we can offer. Thank you. I think the best thing you can do is march your men back to the ship... just for tonight, and then march them back again tomorrow. We are staying the night in Dymchurch. Are you? I wonder where? He certainly seemed to keep you fellows chasing... around the world, I must say. Here's Squire Cobtree. Sir Anthony, this gentleman has been looking for you. May I present Captain... Captain Howard Collier, at your service, sir. Not the one who sank the French frigate Lion d'Or at the mouth of the St. Lawrence? Then you've heard of me, sir. Certainly. We're not so out of touch that we don't know something about our national heroes. Squire, I should... Your man has been telling me... you chased this fellow halfway around the world. Capt. Clegg, sir. Capt. Clegg? So, this is where the rascal ended up? Yes, I flatter myself that I gave him a run for his money. But you never caught him, Captain. Yes, that's true. But... how did you know? He was hanged at Rye, I attended his last rites as Prison Chaplain. Last rites? I suppose he repented all his sins at the last moment? He died a Christian... I interceded to obtain him a Christian burial here in Dymchurch. Well, if I'd have caught him, he'd have a different end. I would have had him hanged, drawn, and quartered. Publicly, too. I'm sure you would, but you didn't catch him, did you? Well, I must be... Squire? I may take you for supper, Blyss. Delighted. Thank you. I should like a word with you... Not now. It's important. Very well then. Join us for super. At the inn. 8:00, sharp. You honor me, sir. Shall I see you and your men at Evensong, Captain? 7:00, sharp? I very much doubt it, Parson. Sailors have other ways of looking after their spirits. "Sing a little and laugh a little" "Work a little Spend a little" What are you staring at, son? I can tie that knot. Want to be a sailor when you grow up? No, I'm going to be a hangman. I'm gonna string him up and cut him down. We may have business for you, boy, before we finish here. Have you all done staring? If it's all the same to you, miss, I'd like a few minutes more. Imogene, Mrs. Rash wants you. Yes, Mrs. Rash. You slip round the back and see if there is any more of this ale. "Sing a little and laugh a little" "Work a little and spare a little" "Twiddle a little and put in the middle" "Let's drink up all we can" "Twiddle a little and put in the middle" "And drink up all we can" Harry! You shouldn't come here. Aren't you pleased to see me? No. It's not right for the Squire's son to be hanging around... Hanging around the back of the inn to see the barmaid. You keep telling me that. It's true. We'll go in then. No, please don't do that. If Mr. Rash should see you, I don't know what he'd do to me. He doesn't treat you badly, does he? No. But he's my legal guardian, and he could send me away if he wanted to. If he should he guess that we're seeing each other... Let him guess. Harry, give me that... Why should he object to me? Wouldn't he like you to marry... the Squire's son? Marry? Lmogene, you know we will marry as soon as we can. So you said. I do love you so. Yes, you've said that, too. You said that if your father wouldn't allow you to marry me... then we'd be married secretly. So we will. We'd leave here... and go to some new place where no one knew or cared who we were. So we will. Then why don't we? Because I can't. You see, I might be in some danger. What danger? Lmogene, where is that ale? Quick! Don't let him see you. Later? I'll try. I thought I told you to hurry. Bringing it now, Mr. Rash. Wait a minute. Has somebody been out here with you? No, no one. Where have you been all this time, girl? The Squire's here with his party. Take this in to him. Hurry now. Pigeon pie. It always amazes me how Mrs. Rash gets so many birds under one crust. She's a Dymchurch woman. What goes on under the crust of this village would surprise anyone. Rash, bring out some Madeira and open a bottle of Chateau Lafite. I have already taken the liberty of doing so. Splendid. One moment, Mr. Rash. I was told you didn't stock wines in this inn. No, sir. But the Squire generally keeps a few bottles... from his own private cellar here. And a very pretty wine it is, too. And a pretty duty it pays. Or should, then. By thunder, sir, are you suggesting that... Perhaps you'd like my cellar book? I cannot believe he... The Captain is only complimenting you on your choice of wine. I hope you'll sample my little stock. If you stay long enough. I should be pleased to. Where have you been? You're late. I'm sorry I'm late, sir. But that doesn't answer my question. Where have you been? You left these outside, sir. I was otherwise engaged, Father. Wenching again, I'll stake my wig. My son. The free thinker. Fair shares for all, and all that nonsense. You don't get it from me, I can assure you of that. What do you think of it? What with that and his wenching... You should be very glad that he has an eye for the ladies. It's high time one of the Cobtrees introduced some good looks into the family. What is it, Bosun? It's about the billets for the men. What about them? There ain't none. There's not an empty room in the whole village. Should I march the men back to the ship, sir? Yes. I suppose you could. Just a minute. What sort of men are they, Captain? The sweepings of Chatham, I'll be bound. They're as fine a body of men as you'll get. Yes, but they won't object to discomfort? They're used to that. There is a barn of mine they can use. It's around the back of the church. The boy will show you. Go see about it, Bosun. Aye, aye, sir. I do seem to have made rather a mess. I better just slip down into the bar. Mrs. Rash will... give me a damp cloth. I'm so sorry. Excuse me. Thank you very much, Squire, for the... On the way. Give us a song, He can't sing. We don't want no words, just a melody. Give him the note, Dad. Not until your song. Go on. One, two... Stop it. Let him go. Give us a kiss, then. It must be the drink. Can't think what's come over the heathen creature, Your Reverence. Generally, he's as quiet as a lamb. What on earth's happening? My apologies, Parson. Bosun, what happened? One of your men got a little out of hand... but then our local ale is rather strong. Please, it's of no consequence. Shall I get the men outside, sir? Sooner the better it would seem. Yes, Bosun, march them off. All right. Come on, you rum-swilling rats, outside, come on. Free thinkers, the lot of them. This wouldn't have happened in the old King's time, you know. Well, let's get back to our pigeon pie. Come on. I understand it was you, Squire, who found the body of Tom Ketch... in the marsh this morning? Well? Have you any idea how he died? Dr. Pepper says it was heart failure. If that's what he says he died of, then that's how he died, as far as I'm concerned. More pork, Blyss? No, thank you. Heart failure. It was rather sudden, wasn't it? I don't know if it was sudden or not, I don't very much care. Neither, sir, do I very much care for the tone of your questions. I'm sure the Captain is only trying to do his duty. Let him do it with a little respect for his betters. Why are you so interested in this man, Ketch, Captain? I might as well tell you. Since he can come to no more harm. It was Ketch who told me of certain activities... he knew were going on here in Dymchurch. What activities? Smuggling. If there was any smuggling here, I'd know about it. You forget that I am to be chief magistrate. How do you think Ketch died, Captain? Thank you. I don't know. All I've heard is some cock and bull story about being frightened to death... by phantoms. Phantoms, ghosts, spooks. You haven't heard, of the Romney Marsh phantoms, Captain? Are they some local superstitions? Don't tell me you believe in them, Squire. Would you kill an albatross or set sail on a Friday? No, I wouldn't, but... Local superstitions of yours, Captain? But have any of you seen any of these so-called phantoms? You, Squire? You, Parson? I know many honest men, whose word I trust implicitly, who have seen them. I've seen them, sir. You have? What do they look like? They were horrible. Their horses seemed to move without touching the ground... or even making a sound. Their faces were like nothing on this earth... glowing as if... they were on fire. How many were there? A dozen or more, it was difficult to tell, Father... they kept appearing and disappearing. They disappeared 'cause they weren't there. Except in your fevered imagination. You'd change your tune if you saw them for yourself. If I ever saw them, sir, it's this I'd change. To water. Now with your leave, I must see that my men are bedded down for the night. Bosun, here we are. Thank you, boy. Here. Give him this. Lovable little creature, isn't he? What happened to him? He fell foul of Capt. Clegg. The pirate? Aye, that's him. He attacked Clegg's wife, so they say. So they left him to die on a desert island in the South Seas. But we were up on Clegg's heels at the time and we picked him up. Lucky for you we did. Is he always like this? No, he's all right, in the ordinary way. Tonight something seems to have upset him. He ain't his usual happy self. Get back! See, he's frightened of fire, boy. You know, he doesn't seem to like the look of you. Some people have that effect on him. And when he is like that... he'd just as soon slit your throat... or claw out your gizzards as look at you. So the local people really believe in these marsh phantoms, Parson? They're very devout here, they don't meddle with forces of darkness. You're a doctor of divinity, don't tell me you believe in them, too? I believe in the power of good and evil. Good night, Vicar. Good night, Mr. Mipps. I know that strange, devilish forces do exist... with powers beyond the comprehension of mere mortal men. It's best not to antagonize those forces. I saw them. What in heaven's name, man... Oh, God! The phantoms... they passed so close I could have touched them. Steady, man. I saw them just as close as you are to me now. I never want to see their likes again. Where did you see them? In the village? Village? No. They're out there. On the marshes. They scared the wits out of me. Where on the marshes? Where? North, south, east, west, where, man? I couldn't say exactly. Then think exactly. Think, man. He's had a terrible experience. Out there somewhere. How far? A tidy way, about a mile or more. A tidy way. No faces... only skulls. If you have all the information you require from him, I'll take him home. He is coming with me. He's going to show me these marsh phantoms of yours, Parson. Can't you see he is ill with shock? Then a walk across the marshes will do him some good. Come on. In the name of charity, Captain... In the name of the King, I'm taking this man. Good night, Parson. Captain, I don't want to go back there. Come on. Pleasant dreams, mateys. This stuff tickles, doesn't it? Come on, mate. Get your head down. Come on outside. Come on, you scum, let's see the color of your feet. Get outside. What's up then, Bosun? You are all going for a nice long walk across the marshes. That's what's up. Now move yourselves. Come on outside. Come on! Move! Come off it. Go to sleep. Which way? There, sir. Right, lead them off, Bosun. Right turn! Forward! Everything ready, Mr. Mipps? It is, yes. We'd better move quickly then. I think we are about ready now, Mr. Rash. It's them, it's the King's men. Evening, Captain. Working late tonight, coffin-maker? Yes. These chilly evenings are good for business. And if you lot were to get lost in the marshes, it'll be even better. That wagging tongue of yours... will have us all dangling one day. Just attending to business, Mr. Rash. All safe now. Wait, I want a word with you. Why? What have I done? It's not what you've done but what you might do. You're becoming a danger to the organization. You're losing your nerve. I don't like the King's men around our necks. Would you prefer the hangman's noose? That's what you'll get us all if you're not careful. I ought to be with the others. You'll not join them tonight. You'll go home. Why? I've always done my share. Carried out my orders. Come and see me tomorrow evening at the vicarage. We'll be safe by then. Where are you going? Where are you going down there? Of course, this is only the outskirts of the marshes, as you might say. Once you get right into the heart of them... then to move as much us one step from the path is more then your life is worth. Six good men we lost that year because they didn't watch out where they were going. Now, the year before we had three... You keep us on the straight course... because where we go, you go. Is this still the right way? Yes, Captain. Right enough. How much further? You've a long way to go yet. You don't seem so frightened of these phantoms as you did. That's 'cause I know we've a long way to go before we catch up with him. And I've got you for company. Now, as I was saying... Halt. Bring that man up here. How much further? Not much further now, Captain. I want to know exactly how much. Maybe a mile, perhaps two. You don't seem very sure. I don't know this place. But you came here less than two hours ago. Or did you? Well, I... Look! The phantom! There it is. I don't like being made a fool of. Bosun, your knife. Hold his ears. You were sent as a decoy to see us out of the way, weren't you? To see us out of the way of your smuggling friends. No! You're going to take us to your friends now, aren't you? I can't do that. Bosun, cut off one ear. No. In the name of mercy, no. You'll do as I tell you? Yes. Which way? Bosun, keep close behind him. Come on, lads. Come on. Keg of brandy for Maidstone... ditto Canterbury. Odds are good. The pack horses are here, boys. I've got a score of kegs and bottles for you this time. Come along, lads, don't waste any time there. They say the King's men are on the prowl tonight. They're off across the marshes on a fool's errand. Good luck to them. Thanks, Henry. Be lively, Henry. That man Collier is no fool. Come along, boys. We can't hang around here tonight. Is that it? Yes. That's it. The scarecrow. He's signaled. Here, that scarecrow. Well, what about it? We passed that way back on the marshes. I swear we did. Surround the windmill! All right, Bosun. Hey, that scarecrow. It moved. It moved, I tell you. That scarecrow moved, sir. Did it? Blood. Good morning, Captain. Getting up an appetite? I'm an early riser myself. Would you care to join me for breakfast? Grilled kidneys and bacon, I think. Carry on, Bosun. Thank you, Doctor. Let yourself in. It's not locked. Party, forward! Down in a moment. Goodbye. I always think this is the best part of the day, don't you? Come in! Thank you. There. What did I say? Kidneys and bacon. Delicious. Come in. Help yourself, please do. Or some coffee first, perhaps. Did you sleep well last night? Exceptionally well, thank you. And you? You were out looking for the phantoms, weren't you? Of course. Don't tell me you've only just returned. Yes. Dear me. You must've walked a long way. Did you have any luck? Yes and no. That's comprehensive anyway. Cream? What did you find? A scarecrow that bled. Why did you flinch when I touched your arm? It wasn't my arm, Captain. You trod on my foot. Captain. What is it? Captain, sir, Bosun says will you come at once? It's urgent. My apologies, Parson. Good day. Come and have some breakfast, Harry, you've earned it. And you had better get these boots of yours cleaned quickly. Must have jumped him from behind, done him in. Got free and made a run for it, sir. Yes. No. Come on. What the... What happened? Douse the fire. What happened, sir? Your mulatto, he broke into my house. Smee, fetch the Bosun with the party. And hurry. I'll see that you're not disturbed anymore. I wonder why he should break into your house. When you catch him you might ask him. He wouldn't be able to tell me, sir. He had his tongue cut out by Capt. Clegg. Can you find your way home? Without your spectacles. Yes, thank you, Captain. Good night. Please take me away from here. Somewhere where we can start a new life. I can't leave here, lmogene. Not yet, that is. But you said you'd be willing to start afresh in some other place. You told me that. It's still true. That's what we will do. But I have to ask someone first. Your father? No, not my father. Who, then? Harry, please tell me. Imogene, do you trust me? Yes, I do. I always have done. Trust me a little longer then, will you? If you ask me to. Mr. Rash. Please get out of my room. Not until I've kissed you good-night... and told you a little bedtime story. The story of little lmogene. Who are you? You know. I know what the Parson told me when he brought you here. He said that your father was some brave Captain that was lost at sea. He was. He was lost all right. To the devil. You're the daughter of a common pirate that was hanged at Rye jail. I don't believe it. Here's the proof. Your father was Capt. Clegg. Don't you fret yourself, my little pirate's daughter... I'll not tell anyone. I've always been respectful to you, haven't I? But I've had to keep my real feelings to myself, until now. Come back! Lmogene. Dr. Blyss. I must see you. Come inside. What's happened? Is it true that my father was Capt. Clegg? Who told you that? Mr. Rash. Yes, it is true. Does it trouble you? Why, because of Harry? We were to be married. And now you think he won't marry you, is that it? My dear lmogene, you underestimate him. My father was hanged in jail. A coward and a traitor. Now, that is not true, lmogene. Clegg was bad but he was never a coward nor a traitor. Sit down. He outwitted the entire British Navy for more than 10 years. They never forgave him. Did you know he was offered a free pardon by the King... for capturing a Spanish slave trader? But he wasn't pardoned, they hanged him. As soon as he touched British soil, the navy seized him and flung him into jail... and then hanged him without a trial. He was betrayed, lmogene. That's why he lies out there now in our churchyard. He's taken the body. You asked to see me, sir? Yes. Imogene's here. She has some news for you. I think she would rather tell you herself. What is it, lmogene? My father was Capt. Clegg. Yes, I know. You know? Dr. Blyss told me some time ago. He asked me to keep it a secret. You knew all the time. Harry. Perhaps you'd like to escort your fiance back to the inn, Harry. Yes. Thank you, sir. What is it, lmogene? I can't go back there. To the inn. Why not? Mr. Rash. What about Mr. Rash? He'd been drinking. He came into my room and... Harry! Young Squire. If you so much as look at lmogene again, Rash... I'll kill you. Hurt your arm, have you? Did you hear what I said? I wonder how you came to do that. I said, "Did you hear what I said?" I heard you, my fine young Squire. So it's my little ward you fancy, is it? I don't wonder at it. Very generous girl is our lmogene. Don't mind sharing her favors. Get his knife, Bosun. Go on, pick them up. Take him outside to the horse trough, and sober him up. Captain, look at his arm! Look at it! May I take a look at your arm, sir? Cut yourself? Yes, Captain. Shaving. I shot a scarecrow, and hit a man. It was you, wasn't it? Captain, I ask you. Do I look like a scarecrow? Take him in there and teach him not to be funny with me. Drink, Bosun. And now perhaps you'd care to tell me how you got that wound? No, I wouldn't. Hold it, Bosun. These lads can get very nasty if they want, you know. I wouldn't tell you, whatever you did to me. No, I don't believe you would. He'll be more use to us as a hostage. Collect a party and take him down to the ship, Bosun. He'll be safer down there. Enjoy your bath, Mr. Landlord? One moment, Mr. Rash. How did you know about the boy's arm? I saw it, didn't I? But how did you know I'd be interested? I've got something here that will interest you, Captain. I will give you this if you let me go free. What is it? I'll turn King's evidence if you will let me... Get up. Bright lad, aren't you? Get him to the ship. Out, sir. Keep him under guard until he comes around. Who's there? Mr. Rash, what are you doing here? It's all up with us, Mipps. We've got to save ourselves as fast as we can. Before they come for us, you and me, Mipps. What are you going on about? It's the King's men. They've got the Scarecrow. They what? They've got Harry. He'll tell them everything. They've got Harry? Where have they got him? They're taking him to their ship. You stay here, Mr. Rash. I'll go for the Vicar. We can't wait for that. He won't do us no good now. Mr. Mipps. They've got Harry. What's that? Keep the ranks, Bosun. Get back. Get back into your ranks. Keep the men in formation. Get back! Hold on. Bosun, after them. Let's have a look at you. I'm all right, sir. Now listen. We've got to move fast, Collier knows too much. You mean we must disband? Yes. I had... Imogene's happiness means everything to me. For her sake, and mine, I want you to take her away, now, before it's too late. Take her away? There's water in there and a towel. Clean yourself up and hurry. But lmogene... Imogene, quickly. Now, wait for me here. Harry. Sir? But why... You'll find out. Come along, Harry, come on. Mipps, all I need is a fast horse... Master Harry. Imogene. Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here, in the sight of God... and in the face of this congregation... to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. To love, cherish, and obey. Until death us do part. Until death us do part. And thereto... And thereto... I pledge thee my truth. I pledge thee my truth. With this ring, I thee wed. With my body, I thee worship. And with all my worldly goods, I thee endow. For as much as Harry and lmogene have consented together in holy wedlock... and have witnessed the same before God and this company. And have declared the same by giving and receiving of a ring... and joining of hands. I pronounce that they be man and wife together. God bless you, sir. You take care of her, Harry. Dear lmogene, be happy. Get your men posted, Bosun. Where is Dr. Blyss? There are horses waiting for you. I can't leave you like this. You can and you will. Now hurry. The last time I saw him was about, I should think, at 10:00. Perhaps even 11:00. Well, let us say half-past just to be on the safe side. All right, Mr. Mipps. Thank you. I believe you wanted to see me? I've come to arrest you, sir. On what charge? And where is your warrant? Have you issued a warrant, Squire? No, I most certainly have not. Captain, unless you give me the explanation you promised... I shall have to report you to the Lords of the Admiralty. Dr. Blyss, I should like you to answer a few questions. Now, in front of the Squire. Then you shall have your explanation, and I, my warrant. In view of your cloth and surroundings... I do not feel I need to ask you to swear to tell the truth. I am ready. How long have you been vicar of this village? Ten years. What were you before you came here? A younger man. I want a straight answer. That is what I gave you. Will you answer me or not? I will. But I must warn you I've lived a very full life... and the telling of it may take some time. However, there is nothing I like better than talking about myself. If you all have the time to spare... I certainly haven't. I'll see you in the morning. This will not take long, Squire. Dr. Blyss... you knew Capt. Clegg, is this true? It's hardly likely to be otherwise, since it was I who told you. But you knew him well? As well as any man could. There is a story that Clegg's wife was attacked by a mulatto... and died in childbirth. That is true. And that Clegg left this mulatto to starve on a coral reef. We rescued him. This same mulatto. Do you think he would be likely to recognize Clegg again? More than likely. You agree that it would be natural for him to seek revenge. Of course. Do you remember the first night you saw him? Do you remember how he behaved when he saw you? He attacked you, didn't he? Why? Because he recognized you, Capt. Clegg. Clegg was hanged at Rye. He's buried out there. He was never buried, because he's not dead. Clegg's grave in the churchyard is empty. He was hanged, yes... but look! Lord save us! Even your cloth can't sanctify the mark of the hangman's rope. Capt. Clegg, I arrest you in the name of the King. Bosun. Aye, Captain. Wait! You're right, Capt. Collier, Clegg was hanged. At least the rope was placed around his neck and the trap was sprung. But he had many friends. The hangman was in the plot to rescue him, and Clegg escaped. But no man can stand upon the gallows without coming face to face with his soul. On that day, truly the old Clegg died. What the new Clegg has done, you all know. When I first came here, I found you in wretchedness and poverty... deprived by harsh laws and heavy taxes... of the simple comforts all men have a right to expect. I took upon myself the task of changing all that... at the expense of the Revenue. What I did was for the good of you all. Take him. Let him go. Come on, Captain, on your feet. Come on. This way, lads! Come on, Captain. You're doing well. They'll never find us here. That's right. Come along now. You're doing fine. We're not beaten yet, Captain. Here. Just like old times. Here, drink this. Mr. Mipps! Captain?
