Ba-ba-ba. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. Why? Idiot. Because we didn't die? Exactly. That's all I have to say about that. Fuck it. Ah, man. Fuck it. We feel fucked up about what just happened. You know what I'm saying? That we're talking about our friend as a result of our condition. It is so removed. Why am I shit? Oh, shit. That's all I want to do, is go home and be alive. Fuck it. Sorry. How am I going to go back to my wife... and tell them that he's gone? We might not even go. It don't have any sense, doing this today. This is what we're going to do. It's irritating as hell. If that's their aim, they've achieved that. I'll tell you. A free loan to al-Bashir for his palace, right. Did you know that? You didn't know that? The Chinese gave an interest-free loan to al-Bashir for his palace. How fucked up is that? Useless. Bashir's cocktail party, I'd love to see you there. If they offered it, they could use some training from the Chinese too. At least they might be on fucking time. Surprise, surprise. Better late than never. If you all gather around, I'll give our itinerary. Okay. Now we are here. Hey, guys. We will be going Please pay attention. Sorry. I will cancel the mission if I don't get complete attention and complete cooperation from all of you. Do you understand? This can be a dangerous area. Okay. It's going to take us three hours to get there. We will be there for approximately an hour or an hour and a half. An hour and a half? How long have been here? I don't want any discussion. That's it. I need everybody to sign their release forms. Once they are done, we can make a move, okay? Turn the radio back on. Sun block 312. An hour and a half. We have to spend the next six hours with this guy. What's the agenda? Can we load up? Can we put this stuff in the back of the car? Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Bring your sun block. Here we go. Decapitated by a tent. Hey. Hey. Smile. Smile for the camera. There we go. That's the game face. Oh man, that's hot. Africa hot. That's what they say, right? Yeah, Africa hot. Sun block? You want some sun block? No. No thanks. Okay. I'm sure I've met you somewhere before. We haven't worked together, have we? No. Huh. I'll figure it out. You had some big article though. Yeah, I've been lucky. It's funny because everything looks the same. Everything is so flat, and they have these cliffs up here that blocks your perspective of where you are. What's that dust storm up there? Would you mind if I took your picture? My daughter wants me to document everything. It's just a disposable. Just a quickie. Thank you. It's a twister. You've been here before? Yeah, I've been here before. That's cool. This is my first time. You guys, it's really hot in here. Could you put on the air conditioner? Man, could you slow down a minute? No. Keep going. We have two hours to get there. We keeping going now- I understand that, but if you look to your left- We keep going. We have two hours to go. At ten o'clock there's a cut on the left, I want you to- Head straight. We are going through the village. We are supposed to go through the village. We are here with Captain Tobamke. We are not on a holiday. We are going through the village. This is why you- They are African monitors here to collect evidence of genocide and ceasefire infractions. Captain, would you say that to our left is something that you would determine as telltale signs of genocide, of a mass grave? Any comments, please? Stop the car. Captain? Go ahead. Stop over there. What's going on? Let's go and see, shall we? Let's have look-see. Okay. The UN deliberates over whether genocide is being perpetrated in the Darfur region. This happened because when the sanctions were issued against the government, the Janjaweed come to end. This is the consequence of that. I see full-grown skulls and children. Everybody. The whole village. They would have burned the whole village. You didn't know anything about this, captain? All I can say is that this is a result of the West sanction. It destroys the people that are meant to be helped. You're saying the sanctions are futile? The sanctions, have done nothing. Bashir promises one thing to the west and he does something entirely different. So they're counter productive. So, what about your inadequate security on the aid convoys? Because they're consistently attacked by government militia, right? And rebels, because of your inadequate- Okay. Come. Let's go. We are done here. Come. Let's go. Let's go. You don't want to answer me, captain? It's a simple question. We have to get to the village. Let's go. Let's go. What's the AU doing to protect the Sudanese against these attacks by its own government, captain? Captain! Everybody, let's go. Back to the village. Come. Come. Gather round, please. Gather round, please. This is Solaiman, who is the head of the village. They say you are welcome, that you can walk around the village, see what you want, take pictures. Now, we are going to be here for about an hour, hour and a half. There one or two people that may speak a little bit of English, but we have somebody to interpret for them. Yes. So you guys are not interpreter. Also, they brought gifts for you and the villagers. They are special from this lady. Okay. Okay. He say, "Welcome, the village is open for you." Okay. Just follow these guys. This is the- Yes, you can go. Go. If you need any- Please, follow them. Yeah, thanks. Can you kindly ask the chief if he has seen any evidence of Janjaweed and government forces working together at any other raids or interaction whatsoever? We don't have proof about that that is clear. The people have an idea... As-Salamu Alaykum. Do you speak English? Delicious. Nutritious. Excuse me, miss. Do you mind looking at the camera for me? Thank you. This number, they escape and no one know where they are. Have the Janjaweed been through this village or in the area at all? They never enter in this village, but they destroyed all the village surround us and all the people, some of them killed, some of them go to the camp, and a lot of people, he doesn't know where. He asks you, why the army of AU, you never protect us? Why do you come after all of the villages are destroyed, and after that you come to us and ask what's going on? You see, the only thing I can say is that we've been given a very limited mandate where Bashir, your president, has allowed us into your country for only humanitarian reasons, so we have not been given a mandate to engage or attack. All we can do is oversee. We can give food and shelter. And that is the extent. It is a very good question. He say, always many people from AU come in to ask what's going on and what time that, but no anything happened to us to protect or save our life. I will try and see whether we can bring more troops here, whether or not we can agree that there should be more protection. But as I said, it is a very slow process. We are dealing with politicians. I am just an army man and I have my orders, but, please, tell him that we are doing everything in our power to make sure that the people are protected and that the villages is safe. From the village? But still you rebuild. You're rebuilding now. You're building. You keep building though. But why do you stay? Why do you stay? So how long have you, your family... How long have you been living here? Of course. That would be great. Okay. That would be good. This is your kids? Yeah. What is your name? My name is Hadeeja Ibrahim. Hadeeja Ibrahim. Nice to meet you. Have you suffered sexual abuse? How old are you? Do you ever remember in your life having any kind of peace? Yeah. That's so sad. We're going to get help for your country. It's okay. You're very brave to talk to me. I can understand how hard this must be for you. Thank you. If you could have one positive wish for your country, what would it be? We will make sure that your story gets told and that people help you and your country. Okay? The people, they- They people, they raped me. It's the Janjaweed. They go around and rape the women. Do you know if they are infected with the AIDS virus? Do you have AIDS? I don't know if I have AIDS. Maybe I don't. Maybe I do. If I get sick, then I'll know. If I die, then I'll know. Do they make a point of telling the women, frightening the women perhaps, letting them think they are infected when they rape them? I know other women, they say- When they come to them they say, "Yeah, we're going to give you AIDS today. You're going to die today." The rapists and ethnic cleansers of Darfur continue to operate despite the ceasefire agreement and three UN resolutions. The world's biggest humanitarian crisis is worsening. I'm really... I'm really sorry and grateful you could tell us your story. On the way here today from the African Union, their base- On the way here we saw bones, human bones, a mass grave, and it's not so far from here. Are you not afraid, knowing what the Janjaweed have been doing to the villagers? Are you not afraid for your wife, for your children? You were together. So you know them. They are Arab and you are black. Is there a difference now than there was before, because you both lived in relative peace? What is this? This is the history of your people, of the village? These are very precious? So it's not Muslim against Muslim. It's more than that. It's Arab against African. It's a racial war. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great stuff, man. We got some beautiful stuff there. Hundreds of years this shit's been going on, killing each other. They seem almost proud of it. Fuck. Yeah. I know you're right. I'm trying not to think about it. As-Salamu Alaykum. We have to go. We have to leave now. We have to get back before it gets dark. We are going. Look, down here. Stop here. It's not an AU convoy, is it? No. The Janjaweed are approaching. How far? About 30 minutes away. They're heading to that village? I don't know. I can't be sure of that. Is there anything we can do? I say we go back. We head back. If we don't, they're going to kill these people. If we're there, they're not going to touch them with western media on site. No. You're looking at me like I'm crazy. What'd I say? No. I want to go back. I think that's nuts. I think you're crazy to think that. I think it's a good idea. They're not going to do anything because we're fucking Americans. We're here to make a difference. We could save these people. You may be right. If the press are there, it's quite possible they won't touch the villagers. You know that's not necessarily the case, captain. We don't know anything. Yeah, you do. We don't know anything, so the decision is yours. Yeah. I say we go back. Are you guys fucking heroes? We're here to report. What are you talking about? What are we doing here if we're not doing something positive? I think it's a terrible idea. These people are dangerous. When we have been there before the Janjaweed come past, and we have managed to protect it. Now, we are not certain they are going to the village. You can tell me for sure that we'll be okay. We can't guarantee your safety. They're not going to touch them if we're there. Well, it won't be all over the press if we don't make it back home. We can't do nothing, and consciously know that they're getting slaughtered. We have to make a decision. If you want to go back, you can go back. If you want to go home, you can go home. We have to make a decision now. You understand? We have to make a decision now. I want to go back. No, no, no, no. This is a mistake, you guys. I don't want to go fucking back. Okay, let's go. This is fucking great. I hope you know what you're doing, captain. I don't think it's a good idea, man. You're pretty handsome in a Dennis Hopper kind of way. This is such a bad idea. This isn't safe at all. No. We're going back. We can save these people. We can make a difference here. That's why we're here, right? That's why I'm here anyway. Come on, William, let's go. Please, stay in the car. Don't move. Stay in the car. I need you to gather everybody here as soon as possible, please. Gather everybody here as soon as possible, please. Come quick. Come. Come. Gather everybody. Everybody, here. Everyone come now. Quick, quick. Everybody, the Janjaweed are approaching the village. We are not mandated to engage them in any way. There are not enough of us here to give them a fight, so what we want to do is, with the help of these journalists, and hopefully these journalist'' presence and our presence, we will be able to persuade them to move on through the village. F-16! Everybody down! The Janjaweed are coming! Take cover! Okay, everyone, back to the vehicles! Back to the vehicles! Stay together! I need everybody! Stay together. Back to the vehicles! Back to the vehicles! Now. Stay together. Try to stay calm. Try to stay calm, everybody. I don't want to fucking be here anymore. Fuck you! Are you crazy?! Let's go. Let's get in the fucking vehicle! I need you to stay back here. Let's get the fuck out of here! I will deal with this. I will deal with this. Back to the vehicles, now! AK-47 assault rifles. I see them fucking coming! Listen, nothing's going to happen. Salaam Alaykum. Alaykum Salaam. Captain Tobamke. Why are they here? We are from the AU. We are an on observing mission from the AU. I brought some journalists to observe, to look at the village, to bring supplies. I can't. I can't. We are just here to observe, to see about the welfare of the villagers. You know you're not supposed to be here, right? I understand. You or the journalists. I understand. So why are you here? We are allowed to observe. Is that what they teach you at the African Union? We have been given a mandate to observe, sir, and we are observing. We are making sure that the villagers and their health is okay. We are here on a- You are not allowed to do anything. We are allowed to observe. There is no observation, captain. This is not your district. You are not supposed to be here. These journalists are not supposed to be here. You are not supposed to be feeding anybody. Food does not help the dead. You know that. These are international journalists. I don't care. I don't care about international anything. So please take your people and leave if you want to protect them. I've been very patient with you. Turn around, tell these people to pack their stuff and go. I will request that you take your men and move through the village. Let us do our work here. You think so? Please, let us do our work. You think you're going to tell me what to do? I'm not telling you what to do. I'm suggesting. That's what it sounds like. I'm just asking that maybe you guys can move on through. We'll be here for another five, ten minutes. The journalists- Captain, I'm going to give them five minutes. If they do not leave, I'm going to consider them a part of this village. If you want to protect your people go tell them right now. Now, captain! You don't believe me? Okay. Thank you. Thank you. He's given us five minutes to leave the village. Now, I suggest we get in the cars because we are totally outmanned and outnumbered. I don't want to inflame the situation. So everybody in the cars. Hello. May I? What do you think you're doing? My name is Bob Jones. I don't care who you are. I'm with the international press. I'd like to know if you have the opportunity to grant us an interview to the international media whereby you agree- You take out this village while we're here- Get this woman out of my face. Somebody has to teach you not to speak when men are talking. You too. I apologize for her. I don't want to see you. I said you have five minutes. Now you don't. You need to get into your cars and leave. Is there nothing you want to say to the international community? Musa! Sadiq! Move! Hey, hey, hey! I can do that. All right, how much? We give you- In the car! Everybody in the car now, please! Everybody back in the vehicle now. I am responsible for your welfare. In the car. Back in the vehicle. We don't want to inflame the situation. Adrian, come on, man. In the car. Let's go. Let's go. What the fuck is that? Let's go. Let's go. You can't have this baby here. It's not safe. Dude, he's right there. Make him stop crying, quick. Christ. Get back in so that we can pull out. It is an AU vehicle. Come, come, come, come. Come on. Just don't hurt it. We made a mistake, all right. In the car. In the car. In the car. Come. Stop the car. Stop the car. Stop the car. What's going on? I'm going back. No, you can't. Get back in the car.

All right. Cover me. You come here in your AU uniform thinking you can save those people. You must think this badge on your arm means something. It means nothing.

You come here and tell our people what to do. You tell the Darfur people that they have rights, and their rights are being violated, instead of apologizing. We're supposed to say we're sorry, we're sorry we colonized you for so long. We're sorry we enslaved your people for decades. We're sorry we've given you all these weapons to kill each other with. Huh? Guess who has the weapons now? Are you sorry? Are you fucking sorry?! I'm going to let you go. I'm going to send you back with a message. No, no.
