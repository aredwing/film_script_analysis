You're beautiful, Ruzica, you make me hard, Come over whenever you like. That is it, Duchess. Have you forgotten? Cry when no one can see you. Who was the one to visit you? You were. Who was the one waiting for you? You were. Just this one time, Ruzica, Just this one time. I'll never wait for you again. Never again. Why do you make me cross Beli, you doll? You've been making me cross my whole life, You snot. Go on... Doing great, doing great... Don't, dont... Get up! Let's go, let's go, let's go... Go on, go on... If I must have a life, Why don't I have a mother? Why don't I have a father? Why are my sisters evil? Why are my brothers beasts? My mother is the gutter, My father's the filthy stream. My grandpa is the old sky, My grandma is the long road. If I bathe in a clear stream Maybe, I'll come out young. Someone might have me... ...for a wife. Someone might have me... ...for a mother. I don't like my mother, I don't like the gutter. What are you sitting there for? I'm done cleaning. Look at that... What... You've worked for a month, You're only screwing things up. What do you think life is about? Did they leave together? Did they? Noooo! What are you doing here? What are you looking at, shitpot? - You can't talk to me like that. - Don't tell me what to do, bitch! I am not a bitch. You are a bitch. I should've strangled you When you were a pound of meat. I should've given you away. I should've thrown you away. I let you suckle on me, for a whole year, bitch. And now you turn into a monster. Why are you sad? My mother doesn't love me. Who? Me. I don't know of anyone Loved by his mother. Your mother didn't love you? You will. No I won't. My father might've loved me. - Are you letting him have some pussy? - Shut up. She won't... ...you have to take it. Shut up. No one's throwing you out, Better off staying with your folks. Mine threw me out over and over again... Some bride. Shut up, you. God willing. What do you want? I'm bored. I'm off to town... Stay with me. I'm going... ...for everyone to see me. For whom to see you? See if I give a fuck. Shall I sleep here? Go on. Tell me something nice. No. Hope you die if you don't love me. Hope to die. Go there. Here? There. You're looking at me, my love... You're looking at me And I'm thinking, I'll die if you stop, I'll die if you carry on. I'd like to go with you... ...to the white world. Here's a world for you... Where is he? Well, You see, He can take and mount that thing And go where he pleases... That... Haven't seen my child for six bleeding days. You're used to longer than that. You used to have a cock once, too. It is what it is. Look at how soiled she got here. Fucking little fool. She was a beautiful baby, dad? You were a more beautiful one, If you ask me. She was bald. Bald. Did you love my dad? Fuck off kid. And my mother, did you love her? As if you know what a mother is. Did Zivina beat my mother? Did mum and dad love each other? Stop bugging me. You want me to leave. I want a break, baby doll, I need some air. You do like me. Don't get boring. - Did you get tired of me? - What's the fuck to you? I'm having a baby. What?! I'm having a child. You stupid or what?! Watch your mouth when you're talking to me, you little scum! If my father were alive today, He'd fuck your dead mother. My head hurts more and more Ever since I laid my eyes on you. Wait, I want to tell you something. Both you and that slut of yours, Can go fuck yourselves. Let me tell you something. I've been looking at you my whole life. I've looked after you my whole life and you betray me. You're nowhere to be found when there's grief, only when there is fun... - I didn't know... - You come here now?! I didn't know it... I wish you were dead... I'm not well. You know how to fuck. Yet you don't know how to buy a condom. You're so stupid. Shut up. I'll be blind as a cock. Blind as a cock... Look, That's not how King will do it. - What do you want? - A word with you. I want to tell you. I fucked it all up. It's what it is, I'm sick Duchess. I'll go blind and then I'll die. Nothing more. Just a little while longer. I want to make Rosa my wife. Why her? I'm fond of her. She's pregnant with me. That's why I sent her away. You're gonna be a grandmother! You're gonna be a grandfather. What did you just say? You're gonna be a grandfather. What are you saying? Rosa is your child. She's got nothing to do with Zivina. Zivina knew. He set out to kill you. That's when I... He gave her an ugly look, too... ...ugly... What do you want me to tell you, King? Thanks for the chocolate, You needn't have bothered. Does he take care of her? I couldn't give a cunt's fart about that. But thanks for chocolate. All is gone, King, huh? Is it hard... Huh? It's always been like that for me. Always hard. By the crystal mountain stream... There laid the woods and the greens. And a worried maiden there, Was speaking through her tears Come back to me, my gallant hero, come, so valiant and young It's on your chest... ...on your chest, that I will die. Your chest, all on fire. We were born on the same year, I used to carry your schoolbag. My sister was raped, My mother I never knew. I was a child, Grew up right then. No one dared lay a finger on you. You're the only one who ever loved me. Came to my house, ate and drank, you're the only one who ever loved me, I'll wait for you in hell, I'll take you by the hand, That's where I will kiss you, That's where I will... ...kiss you. I'll go out for a while And then I'll be back. I'll be waiting. Who's that? Me, who else? Check it out, I got new tires. And the heaters, and the handles... A hundred horsepowers... Can ride it to the end of the world. I banged on, oh mother, I toiled, oh father, The pit took my days of youth, The life took my days of joy, Worked in foreign lands, oh mother, Strangers'lands they were, oh father, Bought a crazy horse With greasy tires on it, I own a pub, a great big pub, Where people can rejoice. The road was kissing me, And the merry skies. Now my old age is lonely, oh mother, My old age is blind, oh mother. I will never fly no more, I will never kiss no more, I will never fly no more, No more, Never, no more. I am the King, Got me a daughter, I am the King, Got me a loving wife, I am the King. I banged on, oh mother, I toiled, oh father, The pit took my days of youth, The life took my days of joy. I am the King, Who's got no eyes, I am the King, Who's got no nothing, I am the King. I'll never fly no more, No more will I set eyes on my loving daughter, no more will I kiss my beloved wife. A curse on the pit, oh mother, A curse on life, oh father, A curse on the king. Who's gonna hear how I feel, Who's gonna hear me cry, Who's the King gonna cry to? The King flees like a doe, The King cries like a pussy, The King is no more, No more. I am the King, Who's got no eyes, I'm the King, Who's got no nothing, I'm the King. I know your scent. What do we do now? I'll let you have her. Come tomorrow. She must not know. No. Why won't you kiss me? You're the only one I love. I've been waiting for you to stop being angry. Kiss, I can't wait anymore. - I'll never kiss you again. - Why not? You must kiss me. No. You have to! - No. - Please!!! Mum... Give me your hand... Now the other... You go with Beli now. You know. Go on, mother loves you. Go on, Beli, you doll, That's how it is. If you love Ruzica, love her child and her grandchild too. Go on... Go on... Go on!!! Alen Musovic - KING - 1966-2009 We'll come to you, where you are, To your festive tables, To your shiny gardens, We'll come to you, where you are, Where you swine are fattened, Where your gold is flowing, We'll come to you, where you are, We'll be saying, here we are. We will drink from your eyes, We will eat from your stash, With golden spoons. When the night falls, When beloved night falls, Our sad eyes won't show, Our bare feet won't show. We'll do it tomorrow, And the day after tomorrow, And then we will fall down, We will fall down in rows. Nothing will remain, oh! The merchants will trade on, The high and mighty will stick to their kin, There will be winter in spring. The gutter is our mother, Misery our sister. Hunger rubs against her, Our brother is the blade. Blue sky is our father, Blue sky so far away, And the earth will kiss us, Long into the night, Closing our eyes, Closing our eyes.
