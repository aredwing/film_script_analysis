But it's also made up of many millions of particles... far too small to see. And these tiny things arejust as important to life as the large ones. Many eons ago, dinosaurs ruled our planet. Most of them were huge, but among these giants lived tiny creatures-- dinosaurs the size ofkittens. In a world of such immense creatures, something so small could easily be overlooked. But small things can be very important. The dinosaurs of the Great Valley knew that-- especially when that small thing was a tasty flower... which bloomed only once in a great while. [Sighs] They look so pretty. [Sniffs] And they smell so good. But mostly, they taste so great. [Spike] Mmm. They look all ripe and ready to me. - [Spike] Mm-hmm. - Yep, yep, yep. Me think so too. I say we eat one. - Ducky, no. Wait! - Whoa! Why did you do that? Come on. You know the rules. Everybody has to wait until Nibbling Day. Then we all come here together and we take turns, and we all get a tree sweet. [Chuckles] That's the way we always do it. It's the only fair way to make sure everybody gets a-- Spike, don't! [Grunts, Chuckles] [Littlefoot] You've gotta wait too. Me get what you say 'bout bein' fair and all, but me thinkin' all the time-- all the time thinkin'-- and me think this: If me fly up to tippy-tippy-top of tree-sweet tree and take tree sweets from tree for me and you three-- [Affirming] then we okay, see? Say that again? Uh, no. Me just get 'em. Ooh. Lots of good ones up top. Okeydokey, here me go! [Yells] [Continues Yelling] [All Yelling] [Cera Laughing] I asked you a question,young one. What were you up to? M-Me? Oh. Oh, me. Um, me think me see flying pointy-bottomed stinger up on tree sweets, so me tryin' to chase 'em off? Well, all right then. Everyone in the valley is waiting for a taste of those tree sweets. They've been waiting a long time, and I don't want any of them to be disappointed. That's why I've made it my job to pay attention to every single little morsel on that tree. And if even one of them disappears, I'll know it. Understand? Humph. [All Sigh] [Laughing] He caught you so bad. Looks like you'll have to wait until Nibbling Day after all. And we all know who gets the first tree sweet on Nibbling Day. Yeah. Why is that anyway? 'Cause I was the first one to find the tree-sweet tree. Everyone knows that. That is not how I remember it. Nope, nope, nope. [Petrie Narrating] Me 'member too. It was the first time us ever saw the tree-sweet tree.! [Gasps] Hey, guys. Come look what I found! [Strains] - Hey, what's this? - [Straining] [Yelps, Grunts] [Others Laughing] [Petrie] Oh, that is good one. [Laughs] [Laughs] That's right. That's exactly how it happened. [Others Laughing] Heh. Yeah, I guess you're right. Littlefoot should have had the first tree sweet. He was just too... little. Huh? What? Oh, I don't mean " little" exactly. You know-- short, small. Whatever. You-- You think I'm small? Come on. Don't take it so personally. I'm just saying you're not exactly normal-sized for a longneck, are you? I'm-- I-I'm still growing. Oh, is that what's happening? Huh. It's taking a while, isn't it? So long, " little foot." [Laughing] Do not worry, Little-- U-Um, you will grow... someday. Me think so too... probably. Yeah. Thanks. See ya later. [Petrie] Way to go, Ducky. I-I didn't mean to-- [Female Dinosaur] Topsy? Is that really you? Huh? Topsy! It is you. - Tria? - Mm-hmm. W-When did you-- I-I mean-- I-I mean, how-how did-- I mean-- Whoa-ho-ho. [Chuckles] Why, Topsy, you haven't changed a bit-- still the handsomest thing with three horns. [Giggles] [Chuckling] Oh! [Straining] Oh, I-I'm hooked. Yep, the same old Topsy. [Straining] [Laughs] That Littlefoot. Imagine, telling me I don't get the first tree sweet. [Laughs] [Cera's Dad] Of course you get the first tree sweet. Daddy? [Tria Giggles] [Tria] You'd do that for little old me? - [Cera's Dad, Chuckling] W-Why, sure I would. I'd-- - Dad, is that you? Yeah. Great. So, um-- [Whispering] So why don't we get together later. Whatever you say, good-lookin'. - [Sighs] - Daddy? Cera, uh, what a surprise. Who were you talking to just now? Talking to? Why, u-u-um, u-u-um, um-- Hey, you know what we haven't done in a long time? Gone to the watering hole together, huh? Huh? Uh, what do you say? Just you and me-- family time. Okay. Sure, I guess. "Too little." " Small one." For now, maybe. But one of these days-- [Grunting, Straining] [Resumes Grunting, Straining] Here, Littlefoot. Would you like a ride? What's the matter? You think I'm too small or something? Can't make it on my own? Why, no, Littlefoot. That's not it at all. Well, you'd be right. I am small. Perhaps for now. But you'll grow. Of course you will, Littlefoot. Just think how big your dad is. And your grandfather-- why, he was once your size, and look at him now. He was? You were? Yes. Yes, Littlefoot, I was. Just your very size. Not by your age, of course. Uh, well, no. Uh, by your age, I had grown. [Sighs] Thanks. And so will you. You'll grow. I promise. [Sighs] Maybe they're right. Ah, maybe they're all right. Maybe I am small. But I'm big enough to get the first tree sweet. [Strains] Come on. You can do it. [Straining, Grunts] Oh, yeah. I got you now. Almost there. [Yelling, Grunting] [Gasps] Oh, no. [Moans] [Groans Softly] Huh? [Chomps, Gulps] Uh? [Gasps] [Screams] [Others Yelp] - Uh? - [Tria] Did you hear something? Just a flier. If you say so, big fella. But it sure sounded to me like somebody screamed. Nah. What would anybody have to scream about... on a beautiful day like today? [Cera's Dad Screaming, Echoing] What was that? Ah, Mr. Threehorn again. But what's wrong? I don't know, but I'm sure he'll tell us. [Adult Dinosaurs Chattering] So, Cera, you mad you not gonna get first bite of tree sweets? What do you think? [Yelps] [Jowl Shake] Uh, yes? [Cera's Dad] Have you ever seen such a sad sight? All those tree sweets-- near the peak of their flavor perfection-- gone! [All Chattering] But that's not the saddest part. The worst of it is that someone here took them. - [Others Gasp] - That's right. Someone here stole from you. Because of them, you won't get a tree sweet. [Others Murmur] Well, I was sure looking forward to eating one of those tree sweets, because-- Well, because Topsy here promised me the very first one. Didn't you, handsome? [Clears Throat, Mutters] Did her say " Topsy"? Ew. D'oh! D'oh! What's the matter with-- I didn't do it! You hear me? I didn't do it! [Gasps] Uh-- Hey, I know you. I saw you running away when Topsy and I found the tree sweets gone. [Cera's Dad] Well? What do you have to say for yourself,huh? Okay, okay. I was here. But I didn't eat the tree sweets. I didn't. I swear it. Oh, yeah? Then who did? [Gasps] The little ones, that's who. Little longnecks-- I saw 'em with my own eyes. - They were only about this tall. - [Female Dinosaur] What's he talking about? It's true. And they ate all the tree sweets-- ate 'em right off the tree. I came walking along and saw 'em. I was so surprised I screamed. - [Adults Gasp] - And then I ran away to, uh-- you know, to go find help. But I guess Mr. Threehorn came along right then, and he saw for himself. And then he screamed. Shouted, not screamed. Okay. Yeah. Shouted. So, wait. Y-You saying the tree sweets all get et by little-bitty longnecks... 'bout this big? Yeah! [All Laughing] Yeah, right. [Laughter Continues] Nice try. You are in so much trouble. Oh! He's telling the truth. [Laughing Stops] Look, those bite marks were made by something really small-- even smaller than Littlefoot. - [Others Murmuring] - Topsy's right. [Murmuring Continues] Me sorry me no believe you. [Cera's Dad] But this is terrible news-- our valley infested with tiny pests... who creep and crawl around under our very snouts eating our food? Ugh, disgusting. Little things are awful. I hate 'em! [Sighing] Oh. [Squawks] [Gasps, Whimpers] Creepy crawlies Creepy crawlies Everybody hates those little creepy crawlies - They tickle and they bite - Ooh! - They sneak around at night - Ooh! Everything about them is just not right Those little creepy crawlies Creepy crawlies Icky, sticky Tiny, spiny Creepy crawlies - They nibble on your ears - Ouch! [Tria] And in-between your toes No! They eat all your food out from under your nose Those awful creepy crawlies They might be smart They might be dumb - We don't know what they look like - Or where they're from The only thing we know is they're different from us And anything that's different is dangerous Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Creepy crawlies Creepy crawlies The world's a better place without those creepy crawlies But every living thing has a role to play - They might be nice - No, sir! - No way! - Not icky, sticky Tiny, spiny Nitsy, gnatsy Smash 'em flatsy Creepy crawlies [Others] Eww! Of course, you know what we all have to do. We have to hunt them down and exterminate them. [Others Affirming] [Grandpa] Wait.! Wait, everyone, please. Let's not get carried away. These little creatures, whoever they are, have as much right to be here as we do. And they have as much right to eat the tree sweets. [Protesting] Then it's settled. We'll rid the valley of this threat. Who wants to search where? [Others Chattering] Spike and I will search together. Mm-hmm. And we will find the little ones first. Yep, yep, yep. Oh, yeah? Well, me a flier, so me look from sky. Me find 'em before you! [Simpering] Come on, Spike. Let us hurry. [Littlefoot] Cera, what's wrong? Why don't I go with you, Topsy? Well, all right, but, uh, we have to be careful. [Cera Clears Throat] Oh, Cera. Oh, um, would you like to search with me? We, um-- Hmm. We need to talk. [Tria, Distant] Topsy, come on.! Go talk with her. I'm hunting with Littlefoot. [Cera's Dad] Cera. Cera.! [Cera] Littlefoot, let's go. Creepy crawlies Creepy crawlies It is so much fun to look for creepy crawlies Searching all around Our noses to the ground [Sniffing] Hoping that the little creatures can be found, those little Creepy crawlies Creepy crawlies Me will be the one to find those creepy crawlies Me flying very high with such a sharply eye Nothing can escape the looker in the sky Not even creepy crawlies Creepy crawlies Creepy Creepy - Crawlies - Crawlies [Both] Creepy, crawly, creepy Creepy crawlies Remember, these things are small and fast. Keep your head to the ground and your eyes open. Ow! Ooh! Huh? Hey, you, come back here! Hold it right there, buster. You're in big trouble. Hey! I said stop! [Straining] [Continues Straining] [Munching, Smacking Lips] No tiny longnecks there. Nope, nope nope. [Swallows] Searching for the little ones is kinda fun. Mm-hmm. - [Swallows] - Hmm. [Straining] [Ducky] I do not think grown-ups are too good at it though. Come back here! Get over here! [Spike And Petrie Laughing] [Ducky] And I do not think Petrie will see anything from up there either. Nothing escape the looker in the sky. Me see everything. Me know everything. Hoo-hoo! Me swoop down on tree-sweet stealers and-- [Gasps] Me see one-- teeny little longneck. Here come looker in the sky! [Chortling] Hold it right there, you tree-sweet stealer.! [Impact] [Grunts, Groans] Petrie, are you all right? [Groans] Me okay, but you look way lot littler from up there. [Grunts] And they swarmed all over the tree-- just like a big bunch of underground creepy crawlers, only a lot bigger, and-- Okay, okay! Nobody really cares. Hey, who was that with your dad anyway? They sure looked friendly. - Hmm. - Have you known her long? Hey, you think maybe he likes her? - [Growls] - She gonna be your new mom? [Growling] No! Are you crazy? No, no, no! [Growls] [Breathing Heavily] Sorry. I was only asking. Well, don't ever ask again. Humph! Yeah. Okay. Sure. Um, you wanna look for tiny longnecks now? No! [Echoing] Sort of a waste of time anyway. How do you find something that little in a valley this big? [Yelps, Hits Ground] Huh-- Oh, great. Help! Cera! [Echoing] [High Voice, Muffled] Would you get up, please? Huh? H-H-Huh? [Voice] Do you mind? I can't breathe. Ah. That's better. [Yelling] Hmm, was it something I said? [Tria Giggling] [Cera's Dad Chuckling] Whoa-ho-ho. Oh, Topsy, you say the silliest things. [Chuckling] - Well? - [Both Gasp] Find any tiny longnecks up there? [Stammering] Why, uh, Cera, how-- Who, uh-- - Hi, honey. - Hi. Cera, here's somebody I've been wanting you to meet. She just migrated here after the cold time, and, uh-- [Chuckling] Huh, well, the funniest thing. We know each other-- [Giggles] oh, from a long time ago. I was a wild young fella, and she was the cutest-- Cut it out. But, so, um, anyway, her name's Tria. Hello, Cera. Topsy's told me so much about you. Funny, he hasn't told me anything about you. That went well. [Screaming] [Continues Screaming] [Breathing Heavily] Uh? Huh? Uh? [Yelling] - [Gasps] - Don't run away again. Uh, you're not gonna do anything to me. [Others Laughing] What could we do to somebody as big as you? [Small Dinosaur] Yeah. You're gigantic. Hey. That's right. I am big, aren't I? Yeah! I'm big. I... am... big! Do you remember me? Uh, should I? Sure. I ate a tree sweet off your nose. Sorta icky, but good. I stood right on top of you. Sorry, not me. You sure? 'Cause I could've sworn-- Nope. Different longneck. We all kinda look alike, so it's a natural mistake. Okay, if you say so. Anyway, my name's Skitter. Nice to meet you. They call me Littlefoot. You've gotta be kidding. [Laughing] [Laughs] Hey, meet my friends. This is Rocky and his twin sister, Dusty. No. I'm Rocky, and she's-- Dusty. Sorry. Anyway, this is Lizzie. - Hi. - And over there's Chatter, and there's-- [Deep Voice, Distant] Skitter.! Lizzie.! [Others Chattering] - Better hide. That's Big Daddy! -" Big Daddy"? - Do you kids hear me when I'm talking to you? - [Gasps] [Continues In Deep Voice] You kids might as well come out. I'll find you sooner or later. Uh,yes, sir. Yes, Daddy. All right. Sorry. - Yes, sir. - [Gasps, Groans] You okay? [Small Dinosaurs Murmuring] You! M-M-Me? You told them about us, didn't you? You told the big ones. No, Big Daddy. It wasn't him. I made the same mistake. It was somebody who looks like him. Hey, maybe he's a-- Twin. Well, uh, if you kids say so. But you know better than to bring a big one here. Lizzie, I'm ashamed of you. My own daughter-- But, Daddy-- Sir, um, they didn't bring me here. I sorta fell in. Oh. [Chuckles] Nobody's fault then. [Laughing] Well, I guess that's it. We're moving! [Small Dinosaurs Protesting] Kids, we've got to go. They found us. They haven't found you. I'm the only one, and I won't tell. It doesn't matter. We have to go anyway. Your folks are looking everywhere for us. We can't even sneak out at night to find food. It's true. We're awful hungry. [Gasps] Maybe I could help. [Grunting] I'll be back. [Both Snoring] [Snoring Continues] Hmm. Huh? [Skitter] Hey.! Littlefoot did it.! [Lizzie] I told you he would. [All Chattering, Laughing] Oh! [Both Giggling] [Littlefoot] Night, guys. [Rocky] Bye, Littlefoot. Thanks.! [Breathing Heavily] Littlefoot, get up. Yeah. [Petrie Yelping] [Moaning] Get up. Get up. Get up. The little longnecks have striked again. What? Thieves in the night. That's what they are. They don't eat only tree sweets but tree stars as well. And they even strike while we're asleep. We must find them. [Adults Chattering, Affirming] Let's form some search teams. [Tria] He's really something, isn't he? Huh? Strong and commanding... and cute. You don't know anything about him. I used to-- back when we were younger. I'd like to get to know him again. Like to get to know you too. Yeah? Well, don't hold your breath. [Sighs] Cera, come hunt with us. Your dad says whoever finds the little longnecks first will get a special treat. Uh-huh. Yeah? Like what? I do not know exactly, but old Topsy says-- Don't ever call my dad that again. Got it? Yep. [Sighs] So, she gonna go with us or what? Hey, uh, what's that over there? I think I see something. Come on! Follow me! [Spike Simpering] [Ducky] Aw, it is not them. [Creature Growls And Snaps] Ow.! Oh, whatever it is, it bites. [Grunting] [Small Dinosaurs Laughing] [Skitter] Thank you. [Yawns] [Swallows, Yawns] [Littlefoot Snores] [Littlefoot Sighs, Moans Softly] Cera, are you awake? Look, I'm-- I-I-I-I don't-- I, um-- It's just that-- Oh. [Sighs] This is so much harder than yelling. Look. Tria's an old friend, and she doesn't have anyone. She needs protection, and she's really nice. She-- Well, she likes me, and I like her. But I want things back the way they were before, when you didn't like anybody and nobody liked you. I don't think things are ever going to be that way again. Humph. [Sniffles] [Grunts, Snoring] [Continues Snoring] Humph. " Tria." Tri-a. Humph. [Grunts] What kind of dopey name is that anyway? Huh? Hmm. He's up to something. And I'm gonna find out what. - [Spike Snoring] - [Footsteps Approaching] [Gasps] I did not call your dad " Topsy." I promise. [Grumbles] Shh. Come on. And bring Spike. [Snoring] [Straining] Petrie, wake up! [Gasps] [Ducky Screams] [Petrie Sputtering, Straining] What... is... matter with you? Cera was wondering if you could come down. Well, me think... me have no... choice! [Both Scream] [Hitting Ground] What do you think he's doing? Taking a snack to Grandpa and Grandma? [Yawning] Maybe he gather tree stars in his sleep. I do not care. Nope, nope-- [Yawns] nope. Well, it's better than looking for little creatures who probably don't even exist. Come on. [Grunting] - [Grunts] - Huh? Whew. [Petrie] Where he go? [Cera] He can't move that fast. Not again? [Others Yelping, Chattering] We expectin' anybody else to drop in tonight? [Gasps] Huh? [Gasps] We found 'em. These are sneaky, mean little longnecks? Ohhh. [Skitter Groaning] Excuse me. Whoa. You are short, aren't you? I used to be taller. We gotta go tell grown-ups quick, so we can be the first and get the special treat. - [Gasps] Yep, yep, yep! - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Don't do it, guys. Don't tell on 'em. Don't worry. We won't. Just how big of a fool do you take me for? Uh, not very? But Tops-- Uh, me mean, Cera's dad, he wanna hear all about it. That's right. That's exactly why we're not gonna tell him. You mean it? Wo-Won't your dad get mad? What do I care if they ate the tree sweets? I wasn't gonna get the first one anyway. There is something going on between Cera and Topsy... that I do not understand. You don't have to worry about us. We won't give you away. [Small Dinosaurs Murmuring] You know what, young lady? I believe you. [Small Dinosaurs Cheering] Me no think they look so sneaky and mean after all. You want us to show you some of our secret places? Uh-huh. - Sure. - I would normally say no, but you're gonna do it anyway. So I might as well save myself the effort. Come on! [Small Dinosaurs Chattering] [Sighs] [Petrie] Come on, Spike. [Sighs] Hmm. [Excited Chattering] So, your dad gets mad a lot? Oh, yeah. Mine too. Sounds like we've got something in common. Hmm. Can't be too careful. Rainin' big ones around here. [Chattering, Laughing] Whoo! Whoo! Who wants a ride? [Laughing] [Small Dinosaur] Hey, come on.! Follow the leader! Come on.! Come on.! Come on.! Let's go.! [Chattering, Laughing] [Straining] [Cera] Come on.! Move it, Spike.! [Straining, Panting] [All Straining] [Face Snaps] Ah-Ah-Ah-choo! [Crash] [All Laughing] [Cera] Come on, Lizzie. [Laughter Continues] So your dad's pretty grumpy too, huh? Yeah. He really drives me crazy sometimes. He can't take a joke, for one thing. [Chuckling] Neither can mine. No sense of humor at all. It's funny though. He always gets the craziest when he thinks I'm in trouble. [Gasps] Same with my dad. He got so mad when we made friends with Littlefoot. I think he was just scared for us. [Both Sigh] Dads can be a problem Dads can be a pain They always act just like they think you've got no brain Sometimes they're enough to drive a girl insane Whoa-oh-oh-oh Oh, dads Oh, dads They treat you like a baby like you're so small you'll break And then they scream and yell When you make one mistake Yeah, yeah, yeah All their rules are more than any girl can take Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh Oh, dads Oh, dads Big dads, small dads I guess it goes for all dads They drive you crazy every single day So crazy So crazy So crazy Fat dads, skinny dads even little minidads But you gotta love 'em Anyway Anyway You know it's 'cause they love you They only want what's best The way they fuss and worry [Crash] They make a girl depressed You wanna tell them Dad, please Give it a rest Oh-oh-oh Hey, Dad Hey, Dad You make me wanna holler You make me wanna shout Find somebody else that you can worry about - Please, please - Please, oh, please Don't be such a dad Please, Dad Don't be such a dad - Don't be such a dad - Please, Dad Please, please Please, please Please, Dad Please, Dad I know my dad wants the best for me, but sometimes I think he worries about me too much. I wish he had someone else to worry about... or maybe someone to help him worry about me. You know what I mean? Someone like, well-- Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. [Straining, Out Of Breath] - [Ducky] Spike, go. - [Straining] See you guys tonight. We will bring lots to eat. Yep, yep, yep. If Spike no eat it first. Don't worry. Your secret's safe with us. Bye, Cera. Don't worry so much, Daddy. We can trust them. Especially Cera. I hope you're right, Lizzie. But there's one thing you've got to remember about the big ones. Just because they're bigger, they think that makes them more important. And sometimes they forget about the little details-- like us. [Snoring] [Sighs] [Grandma] Wake up, Littlefoot. The great circle is already rising in the sky. [Yawns] Gosh. So soon? [Sighing] [Laughing] Are you two sure you feel okay this morning? Uh, we are fine. Just... fine. Yep, yep, yep. [Snoring] [Snoring] [Yelps] [Yawning] [Gasps,Jowl Shake] Be careful, Petrie. [Snoring] [Yelps] [Snoring] [Sighs] Cera? [Yelps, Moans] Are you okay, honey? You look beat. I'm fine. [Sighs] Look, Cera, I have tried every way I know to be nice to you, but you've shrugged me off. Fine. I'm a big girl. I can take it. But I like your dad. I always did. And he likes me, and I think we're good for each other. And I could be good for you, too... if you'd let me. I could be someone who'd help your dad worry about you, you know? I was hoping we could be friends, but I guess that's up to you. Tria, wait. Maybe we could give it a try-- being friends. [Yawning] Mm! Do you think they'll come back tonight? Sure. Littlefoot said they would. Don't you trust him? Mm-hmm. [Petrie] Hey, guys! Wait up. [Laughing] Tonight, me tickle Rocky. See how he likes it. First we have to find the best tree stars to take 'em. Where do you kids think you're going this time of night? I don't know, Daddy. Where do you think you're going? Wha-- Huh? Who, me? Well, honey, I'm-I'm-- I'm just, uh-- I'm on guard duty. That's what. Too big a job to leave to anybody else, what with all the tree stars disappearing around here. You kids get back to bed. It's not safe for you to be wandering around... with all those tiny longnecks on the loose. Oh, Daddy, they wouldn't hurt anybody. How do you know? Oh, I mean-- Well, why would they? We're so much bigger than they are. It's the little ones you have to worry about. Now shoo.! [All Gasp] Skedaddle. Back home, all of you. Don't let me catch you out this late again. Now move! [All Whimpering] [Scampering] [Sighs] [Gasps] Lizzie, where you goin'? Lizzie.! This is bad. This is really bad. [Grunts] Hmm. [Branch Breaks] Halt! Who goes there? [Chuckling] Shh. It's just me, Topsy. Oh, Tria. Now, I'm going to tell you what I told Cera. It's not safe for you to be out here... with all these little creatures wandering around. Oh, come on, Topsy. Loosen up. Live a little. Admit it. You're glad to see me. Well, I-- [Chuckles] Of course I'm glad, but, uh-- - But I'm on duty. - [Sighs] Oh, well. You can't blame a girl for trying. Walk me back. Oh. Okay. No. I can't do it. It's my job to stay here... and look for those little-- [Gasps] Oh! It's so cute. [Panting] Lizzie! [Grunts] You little-- I'll teach ya, you tree-sweet stealers. [Screaming] - Come back here! - Topsy! Leave them alone. Mm! [Lizzie, Skitter Panting] [Growling] Did they get away? For now. Good. But now we know where to find them. [All Clamoring] And though I gave chase, the vicious little vermin narrowly escaped. But I found their lair. [All Clamoring] Yeah.! Yeah.! Now we can return to their hideout... and rid the Great Valley of this scourge forever.! [Dinosaurs Clamoring] Oh, no! No! They're not like he said! - What? - Sure, they're little, but they're cute and... frightened. We should just... leave them alone. If you don't know what you're talking about, you shouldn't talk at all. What? I say we go to their hideout and seal it up with rocks. [All Shouting] Yeah.! Come on.! [Grandpa] Everyone! Please! We should talk this over. Please, listen to me. [Clamoring] Keep movin'! Grandpa, we've gotta stop 'em. Yes. Yes, Littlefoot, but how? I know how. [Dinosaurs Clamoring] - There it is right there. - That's the place. [Continue Clamoring] - [Gasps] - [Cera's Dad] Push! [Both Grunting] Push! Come on! Keep pushing! Keep pushing! Come on! [Clamor Continues] Please! Listen to me! Everyone! Please! [Both Straining] Stop! Please! You're making a big mistake! I'm the one who took all the tree sweets off the tree-sweets tree. Huh? What? What are you talking about? - What say? - What is he saying? [Gulps] I didn't mean to. The tiny longnecks ate the tree sweets, but they wouldn't have if I hadn't knocked them all off the tree. I was gonna tell the truth, but when I saw how mad everybody was, I got scared. So I blamed everything on the tiny longnecks. [All Gasp] Do you still trust the big ones now? Anyway, I know now that they're nice. They're really nice. And I-- [Sighs] I'm sorry. [All Murmuring] [Sighs] Well, I suggest we all just go home... and leave these little creatures in peace. [All Murmuring] Come on. Let's go. Yeah. [Murmur Continues] Well, come, little one. Time for sleep. [Rumbling] [Grandma, Gasping] Oh, no.! [All Screaming] Look out! Hurry! [Grandma] Oh, the poor little things. I'm sorry, Littlefoot. [Sniffles] [Both Snoring] If only I could start all over And take things back somehow I wouldn't have lied or tried to hide If I knew then what I know now If I did something wrong I'd own up Even if I was afraid Now my friends are sad 'cause of the mess I made Strange how little things like lies Keep growing taller Until one day you lose your way And troubles get bigger While you get smaller If I could get it right the first time I'd never have to make mistakes But then you'd never grow and never know The courage living takes If only you remember To think with your heart Why then You'll never have to say If only I'll never have to say If only I'll never have to say, if only You'll never have to say, if only Again If only. I don't recognize this tunnel at all. Hmm. Must have just been created by the big rockfall that closed our way out. Which way-- Do we go? This way. But this'll take us away from Cera and the others. Oh, that's the whole idea. [Clears Throat] Hi, guys. Are you really that mad at me? Well, why? I mean, I can understand the grown-ups and the tiny longnecks, but why are you guys mad? I do not know if I can say it all like I hear it in my head. Me neither. Me mad, but hard to tell why. Yeah, mm-hmm. I will try if you want. Me too. Well, okay. Go ahead, I guess. You messed up the tree-sweets tree, so I did not get any tree sweets, and neither did anybody else. Mm-hmm. You make friends with tiny ones, but you make everybody mad at them... so they unhappy now too. So why you make friends with them in the firstest place? Mm-hmm. You made the grown-ups so mad that they knocked rocks down on the tiny little longnecks... so they are now covered up with rocks, and I do not think that is fair either. [Growls] Plus Spike eated all the bestest tree stars me found this morning. [Murmuring] Mm-hmm. I didn't do that. Spike did. - Hmm? - In that case, me done. I am done too. Mm-hmm. For folks who didn't think they could explain how they felt, you did a pretty good job. So, is that it? You guys won't even talk to me? You hear somebody? Me no hear nobody. I do not hear nobody either. Fine! Tria? Oh, hi, Cera. You're not mad at me, are you? I mean, about the tiny longnecks. I think my dad is. Oh, honey, no. I think it's sweet that you made friends with them. They're cute. It's your father I'm mad at. 'Cause he yelled at you in front of everybody? Well, that. But, mainly, I just got tired of him being so mean to the tiny ones. He didn't used to be so mean. [Sighs] Hmm. He always was handsome though. You know what I think? I think he did it... for you. Hmm? Come again? He wanted to show you how much he likes you by giving you the first tree sweet. And when the tiny longnecks ate 'em all, he couldn't. I think Dad felt like they stole those tree sweets from you. And that's why he doesn't like them-- 'cause ofhow much he likes you. Well, at least we won't have big ones chasing us all the time. - [Growling] - [Gasps] Of course, I could be wrong. Run! [Screaming] [All Screaming] [Growling] [Yelping, Whimpering] [Growling] In there! But those sharpteeth are heading toward the Great Valley. I know. That's why we're not. But what about our friends? They're big enough to take care of themselves. Now come on. Huh. Who needs friends anyway? I'm big enough to take care of myself. [Growling] Me no believe you talk to Littlefoot like that. You so mean. Oh! I am not meaner than you. - You are the one who made him the saddest. - [Both Gasp] Yep,yep,yep. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. But me no want to make him sad. [Crying] Me Littlefoot's bestest friend. [Crying] Me too. I am his bestest friend too. [All Crying] Now that's a disgusting sight. [Sniveling] We-We chase Littlefoot off. Don't just sit there crying about it. Make it better. Go find him and tell him you're sorry. [Sniveling] How-How come you so smart all of a sudden... about making things better? I've just gotten some practice lately. - Hey. There's Littlefoot now. - Littlefoot? Hey, Littlefoot. [Growling] [Screaming] [Whimpering] [Growling] [Screaming] [All Yelling, Screaming] - [Screaming] - [Roaring] Leave her alone, you big bully! Don't just stand there. Run! [Roaring] [Screaming] [Straining] Let's go, Ducky! I am so, so, so, so sorry for what I said. Really. Really so, so-- Tell me about it later, okay? [Screams] [Panting] [Whimpering] Ha, ha! Missed me! [Groans] [Growling, Roaring] [Chuckles, Laughing] - [Continues Laughing] - Lizzie. Skitter. [Screaming] [Littlefoot] Over here.! Over here.! [Growls] Run, kids! I can handle this guy. Maybe. [Growling, Roaring] Back off! She's with me. Oh, Topsy. I love it when you act all brave. [Growling] - Daddy! - [Grunts] [All Cheering] Whoa! Whoa! [Shrieks] Lizzie! Skitter! You okay? [Growling] [Big Daddy] Hey.! You.! Why don't you pick on somebody your own size? [All Yell] Wow. They came back, all of them. I can't believe it. [All Yelling] [All Shouting, Indistinct] [Shrieking] [Grunts, Screams] Hang on, little ones. I'm coming! [All Screaming] [Cera's Dad] This way.! Run.! This way.! Stay behind me, kids. [Shouting, Indistinct] [Dinosaurs Shouting, Indistinct] [Growls] [Straining] [Grandpa] That should do it. [Grandpa] Well, they won't come back that way. I still can't believe you came back to help us. Well, sure. You're our friends. I'm, uh-- Well, I'm sorry for all the trouble that I caused. Hey, you're a dad. That's what we do. But you also saved my daughter's life, and for that I'm grateful. Way to go, Topsy. You're the big hero. [Both Chuckling] I'm sorry. We had to seal up that new tunnel. We don't want any sharpteeth getting back in. Great! That means you've gotta stay. Well, I guess, if we gotta, you know, we gotta. Besides, who'd wanna leave friends like you? [All Laughing] [Narrator] The next time the tree sweets were in bloom, all of the dinosaurs gathered for Nibbling Day. Did you see, Grandpa? I could reach. I'm bigger now. Littlefoot, you grew bigger... the day you stood up in front of everyone... and admitted you were wrong. [Grandpa] Now that we're all gathered, let's eat some tree sweets, shall we? [Chuckling] [All Laughing, Chattering] Yeah! [Big Daddy Chuckling] [Narrator] And every Nibbling Day, the dinosaurs of the Great Valley... gathered to celebrate these small things oflife... which mattered so much. Gotcha! [Laughing] "Stoopid"stompers Clumsy clumpers Eating all the tree stars with their giant chompers They're always everywhere Their noses in the air And if they squish and squash us flat Theyjust don't care Those stoopid stompers They're very slow and way too tall They don't know anything at all The only thing they do is eat And eat And eat And eat And smash our houses with their big, fat feet Those Big and clumsy Slow and dumbsy Useless, ugly Not so snuggly Stoopid stompers Stoopid stompers Yeah [Giggling]
