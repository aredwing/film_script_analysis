Milos, you have to play with your head. Yeah, right! Piss off! Hey, Eso! Hey, Luka, you can't be in two places at the same time. Sure, I can! You see, I can! Lord! I hope he remembers me. Hey, Einstein, the coach has a memory for remembering. For remembering? It's been 18 months since we left Belgrade. Just keep your mind on the match. Your job's to play. Hey, Veljo... My great big friend! Here's your pension. I'm glad to see you! Amazing... The miracle of life! Neighbour! Neighbour! Joksa! Hey, Joksa! You're too small to scare me... Get that donkey off the track, Vujan! I'll go bankrupt, my dear Veljo. These are in great demand and that cow won't carry them. - Why not? - She's suffering. Can't she suffer in a ditch? What's it matter where she suffers? I'll have to use... a stick. Get a move on! You won't get in my way. What's this? Why is she crying? She's lovesick. She wants a train to run her over. What train? The track isn't finished yet. Exactly what I told her. I'll use the stick on her. A stick? I'm very sceptical about that. People! They've killed Joksa! Luka! I have to tell you something! Just let me get past. I have to tell you... Just one word! The bears are slaughtering everybody! But Tito shot the last one. They're pouring in from Croatia. Beasts from Croatia! And you just sit here playing! What beasts? Why, bears! They're like ours, only different. A bit bigger but with grey fur. - They must be Persian bears. - Not Persian bears! They're fleeing the war in Croatia. - The track all right? - Why shouldn't it be? Luka, this is no joke. Folks are dying while you sit here playing. Here, boy! Here, boy! Radovan! What's up? Why won't she leave me alone? What is it? Let's stop so I can feed the dog. Be a darling. Since when does a goddamn mayor feed stray dogs? Tell me that. Since when does a mayor gobble breakfast in a car? Can't you see that Lily's in love? Paws off my lunch! Good for you! Scram! You're a lawyer, Filipovic. We made you party secretary. - You know these things better than me. - That's why I'm telling you. There are laws, man. Want to get us arrested? - Only nitwits get nabbed. - Not crooks? That's not what I said. Yes, it is. Fraud is fraud, however you dress it up. But the Muslims and Croats do just the same. Do what? Finance political parties from cigarettes and oil. Building democracy on freight trains! Tito did it for 30 years. Forget Tito. Tito was Tito, after all. I'll tell him everything. If it isn't my dear old brother-in-law! Are we ready for Liberation Day? The band, not the track. The Serbians are behind. But our side is on time! How are my artists? My lovely music! Sir, can I speak to you? Sparavalo, of the Sarajevo Opera. Sarajevo! A magic town. - Mr Mayor... - Wait! Mr Cuhaj, our guest artist from Hungary. A universal artist. This is going to be OK. OK, he says! As president of the town council, I would like to express my gratitude for the support you've given our railroad. But we politicians haven't slept. Just read this, bro. Mr Mayor, if we don't organise a hunt the beasts will slaughter us all. "We approve purchase of a Sneider-Holstein locomotive..." This is fantastic! Not a single Serb will be left! Look what you've done! Mr Mayor, friends, allow me to present our project. Here you see the section of track that will link Bosnia and Serbia for 12 miles. - Mr Mayor... - In fact, the Austrians first built this track, but then it was destroyed. We now need to rebuild it to boost tourism and trade. - With this tunnel... - Mr Mayor! ...we will overcome a major obstacle... and be ready for Liberation Day. Well done, bro! We are lumberjacks and we're OK In the green forests of Bosni-ay We are lumberjacks and we're OK In the hills and mountains of Bosni-ay! Listen, hotshots, let me tell you the basics about being a goalie. I can't wait to hear this! You have to guard that line regardless of who's shooting. - Is that so? - You bet. That's why there are no smart goalies. Did Einstein say that? No, you idiot! Wrong again! It was the coach who said it. And now Tomo Krotolina's gonna show you how to shoot. Where are you going, for God's sake! Didn't you say you're fearless, goalie? Then come with me. - What for? - Prove that you're fearless. But don't pull! Who's pulling, Mr Fearless? But I wanted to go dancing... No more buts, Eso. Here comes a goal shot. You said you're fearless. - What's all this? - Just stand there! No, bro, stand there! You said you're fearless, so stand still. Milos Djukic! Milos! Come and see our Eso! Here's a cross shot. Catch! Bravo, boss! Bravo, legend! - And now? - Something completely different! Watch this trick. Hold it on your head. - What is this, Tomo? - Just hold it like that. Put your arms down. Just great! Just watch this, Eso! What are you doing? Are you nuts? You crazy fucking idiot! Shit, I missed! I aimed for the forehead. Your turn now, tough guy! Fuck you! You're crazy! No problem, buddy. I'll play the game. Here's your chance. I'm emptying the fucking gun! Relax. A new player calls for fresh bullets. Eso, this isn't a joke. Relax, I've got experience. Uncle Faik bought some guns cheap. We've been practising a bit. Buying guns now? Your turn. Here's a moving target. Tomo, quit messing around. - Milos, out of the way! - Goddamn you! Go ahead, shoot, tough guy! Milos, out of the way! Here we go! I don't give a fuck! If you survive, asshole, I'll kill you! I gotta admit, your uncle's really something. It's homemade. Have a swig. It'll calm you down. We'll get a hunt going. She won't move. She's lovesick. She's waiting for a train to run her over. - Whose donkey is it? - It's Vujan's. - Vujan who? - Vujan Peric from Zabrdje. - Vujan died five years ago! - But I spoke to him today. C'mon! MOveO It's useless! Is she crying? I told you she's suffering. You don't know the secret word. Move it! Step aside. Now whistle. You're not listening to me. I don't say speed isn't important. But any fool can run fast. What are you talking about? - Oh God, are You listening to this? - Sure, He's listening. Don't upset me, Nada. I never said that. I said she looked at her husband and saw he had big ears. Know how Napoleon won matches? - You mean battles. - Right. He'd calculate how fast his cavalry could reach enemy lines and cut them off. Speed's everything! You read a lot, but careful you don't get a headache. If you ride a cloud at the speed of light you can't see yourself in a mirror. I need that speed. Such speed's unhealthy. The feeling matters. - Know what feeling is? - Tell me. Talent. Talent? I'll make a note of it. You either have it or you don't. We were given reason to escape from our upsets and I'm really upset. I don't mean Anna Karenina, I mean me. I wasn't brought here for nothing, you know. My next stop's the nursing home. I heard Luka talking to the director, but he doesn't know I know. He told Luka, "No, Luka, please." "It's too early for Jadranka to enter a nursing home." "She's still young, so don't do it." But I worry for Milos! You know, a child without a mother is like a broken umbrella in the wind. Big fish eats little fish. God, what's wrong with me? Jadranka! I just want you to know, never will I leave this place! Ever! Come on, take a pill. Why don't you take the pill yourself? Think I don't know what you're planning? Don't even think of it! You want your son to hear you? Lie down. Hospital regulations! Look, he won't let her on a stretcher! - Come on! - Please, listen to me... I want to go home. I'd change that guy for free. Just one injection! His wife sings beautifully. I heard her on the radio. There's no nursing home. - Too bad about the dust. - She has an allergy? An allergy? She's out to lunch. That's what I call love. Wouldn't you like to be carried like that in his arms? No way. He's not a Muslim. As if that mattered! - It matters! Ask your dad. - You don't ask Dad for everything. I want to go home to Milos. A mouse! - Here's the doctor. - How you are, ma'am? Come in. It's just a minor allergy. Bosnia! SDA! I'm gonna buy him into every team, right up to the national team. Djukic, get back! He can't handle this! He can handle it. Calm down. Get back when I tell you! Is that the kid you mean? Milos Djukic! Jadranka, come back! - I'm Milos's mother. - Ah, you're the mother! - Milos's mother. - I'm Zurovac. Maybe you remember, he played for Partizan when he was a kid. - He's number nine. - Nice kid. Yes, but he's very sensitive. He's Mommy's little boy. I'm an opera singer. I'm taking time off because of a throat problem. I'm allergic to dust so I'm here to recuperate. Go for him! Close him down! I'm the only one who understands him. I know what it's like to play. Theatre, soccer, it's all the same. "All the world's a stage." Know who said that? I have no idea. Sure, you do. A name that starts with "Sh"... Shekularac? No, a foreign guy. "All the world's a stage." "And all the men and women merely players." - You mean Shuster? - Not at all. - I have no idea. - Shakespeare. I don't follow the Premier League. This is opening night for Milos. Everything in life is a stage. But different things happen on it. - Am I right? - Sure. Take me, for instance. When I sing on opening night, my throat goes like this... Look at the poor woman. The things she does for her son! She's like Mama Juanita. - Let me see. - It's nothing, just a ball! That was awful. You have to hear me in rehearsal. What's her problem? Have you seen the movie, Mama Juanita? No. Then you ain't seen nothing. What's there to see? Know what I'd do for my mother? What would you do for your mother? I'd fuck half the stadium for her. What a generation! For you. Mama Juanita I dedicate this song to you At the break of dawn This song is heard For you. Mama Juanita I dedicate this song to you Here it comes! You abnormal fuck! What's your problem? Let the ball in! Let go of my fishing rod, you motherfucker! This is going too far. Goal! Goal! Milos! Bravo! You're the champ! Ma'am, your "sh" stands for "champion"! The classic champion. Partizan needs a player like him. Eso! Stop the fight! - Leave my son alone! - Leave the kid alone, dopehead! I'll fucking kill you! You did it, Milos! Mommy's coming! Uncle's coming! - I'm coming, my boy! - Leave it to me, Dad! Please! You band of fucking nationalists! Milos! Bash that one, he's getting away! He's getting away! Tell me exactly what he said. He said, "Ma'am, your Milos is the best." - But you know that already. - Spare me your comments. Mind if I finish? Secondly, he said he'd phone in a week's time. - So why didn't he call? - He said if business didn't prevent him. He's a very busy manager. He said, "Partizan needs Milos." What more do you want? A little patience, dear. Anna Karenina had no allergy. She was visiting her brother and she took the train home. No, Nada, he didn't really have big ears. She just didn't love him any more. He was supposed to call last Monday. - He'll call, don't worry. - He'll call? It's been a week already. Not even Einstein would say that. What day is it? - I have no idea. - Saturday. He'll call, I tell you. Will he? If he really needed me, he'd be calling five times a day. Are you crying? - No, I'm not. - Looks to me like you are. - Well, you're blind. - You're crying. I want to go back to Belgrade. I want to play soccer there. Then go, but don't cry. - And you stop shouting. - Who's shouting? You're shouting! I'm not shouting. What's more, you dragged me out here. Did I? And you took me off the stage. Better me than the critics. - What did you say? - Just kidding. When did I ever have bad reviews? - I know... - Tell me, when? That's what I'm saying. Can't a man joke around here any more? Those beech trees don't go with the house. They're not beeches, they're linden trees. Something has to smell nice. What? You want to dig? Then go ahead. Wait. Not like that. Like this. Your foot goes here. What a sensation! I feel like blowing up the whole countryside... Hey, bro, we won't have a border here, will we? - Where do you see a border? - There, Nada. And Serbia's over there. - Customs in the middle of the tunnel? - I don't know. But the border is here. What a tragedy! I want to thank you for turning out in force to show your readiness, when times get tough, to defend your homes against the wild beasts. I officially declare this bear hunt open! Just a quick word... What is it, Filipovic? The party called from Sarajevo again. They said, "Does Radovan know who's in charge?" Are they threatening me? Why are they so hung up on that freight train? - Big deal! - Well, it is big. A million marks. That's what I call greedy. Do you think I'm stupid? No, but we're farting on our own candle. They'll cross us off the map if we don't play along. Over my dead body! No more scams using cripples. Shame on you! I have higher connections in Belgrade. We'll see who fucks who. You or me. Enough of this... When a young hunter I used to be A young girl fell in love with me She was so lovely and so fine She was my darling. she was mine Before I'd set off to hunt at dawn Her goodbye kiss was like a ray of sun It gave me luck along the track A pledge that I would safely come back Rabbit. fox and quail Partridge and wild duck You can catch all these with luck But never will you pick up my trail If only people knew the life to live Happiness is all that life could give Those were days of dreams for me When a young hunter I used to be A bear! Run! All clear, Mr Mayor. Who leads every revolution Who gives us our daily bread Who can be pope. king or sultan And presides over living and dead? It's a man. an intellectual He is the cornerstone of progress A gentleman. a professional His biography is marvellous He can change mud into gold Turn a stone into a flower To create is in his power Honey. it's a man's world You can build an ark To save humanity You can raise your little finger To part the waves of the sea You can build the peace Or the Great Wall of China You can read our dreams. books and beliefs You can make war Transact a NATO pact You can write history. constitutions and poetry But you do all of this Just because of me To conquer a women's heart is the hardest victory It's a man. an individual pure For every illness he finds the cure He builds railroads and great roads Honey. it's a man's world Without me You're an unfinished rhyme Without me you are A sad linden in a desert clime Cities you can build or take apart You can split the atom but not my heart You can make war Transact a NATO pact You can write history... The Serbs of Bosnia-Herzegovina have declared that the murder at a Serb wedding was a shot aimed at the Serb people. Among conditions are demands for an urgent resumption of the conference on the democratisation... Where's Milos? At Eso's. Where else? - What's he doing there? - He likes the cakes. It's Ramadan. He was there last year too. He should stay away from that Esad. Why? He's a good boy. ...the result of yesterday's murder of a Serb, Nikola Grdovic, outside an Orthodox church in Sarajevo. Citizens were advised to stay home. Although there has been no fighting, gunfire has been heard. You ask why? Look around you. They're shooting everywhere and you ask why. - Don't you watch TV? - It's all lies. It won't happen, woman. Folks are reasonable here. The way you talk isn't reasonable. Me? What's wrong with you today? Veljo left a letter for Milos. It may be from Belgrade. On the table. - From Belgrade. - Maybe Partizan wants him. In today's events, one citizen was killed and four wounded... He has to report within 24 hours... to his army unit. The army! That calls for a toast! It's the army, you idiot! Hey, Dad, if only you were here to see Milos off to the army. Fuck you and your railroad! And damn me for letting you bring me out here. What's wrong? - What is it, woman? - What is this? - It's a scale model. - Scale model? What are you doing? You call this a life? - Calm down, woman! - Let go of me! - You call this a life? - Leave that alone! You want a dead hero in the house? Do you want to have a bust made for your son? You idiot! It's not just military service. - OK, calm down. - It's a call to war. - They won't get my child! - Leave Dad alone. I'm not going back! - I won't go. - Wait! What is it now? Upset Mother again? - I didn't say a word. - You did. - So why's she crying? - It wasn't me, honest. - A Ramadan cake from Mom! - Thanks, son. Off I go. Do you have a spark of intelligence? Want to hear something intelligent? - Yes, tell us. - Come here. That manager, Zurovac, called. He made me an official offer. They want your son to join Partizan. - Milos Djukic! - That's my boy! That's my boy! Milos! Tomo's got something for you! Something fancy and modern! Basic training? Just basic training, honest! Filipovic arranged it with the army. You can ask him. Milos! Hold on, son! Calm down! What is it? I don't believe him. Not a word he says! You have to do basic training. That's the army. Not even God can change that. That's how it is. - That's how it is? - Yes. How it is? As soon as you finish basic training, you join Partizan straightaway. Listen to me. It's all been arranged. What's this? Why the long face if it's fine? Who has a long face? You know what I mean. What do you mean, long face? Just what I said. Why do you look so miserable? Miserable? Oh, son, I was born that way. Quick! Here's Tomo Krtolina, your Santa Claus! Where have you been, Tomo? Three, four... Come one. come all Come everyone When I take my oath this fall... Go to your mother now. Mother! Milos! - Aleksic! - Hey, Luka... Old pal, where you been? I have to ask you something. You're my only hope. Me, your only hope? If a soldier's your only hope you're really in bad shape. It's about the war. She's bugging me. She says he's going to war, not basic training. - There won't be a war. - There won't? If everything goes according to plan, we can avoid it. Auntie's little honeybunch! Where will you be stationed? - In Novi Sad. - That's not far! True. What's it near to? The battle zone. You're as good at geography as my old lady is. I've been halfway across Europe. Just eat. Eat! I have no one here. Just my son. And my husband. Come over here. I have something to tell you. Oh, you're so funny! Our chief's in Moscow. If they let us, the military could take over, and put an end to all this shit. That means no war? - No war, Luka. - Thanks, Aleksic. - You're a real brother. - Sure, Luka. No war. Excuse me! Come over here. - What is it? - Over here. C'mon, give me a little kiss. - We won't have a war. - Says who? Someone who knows. That "someone" will end up starting the war. Luka, you poor martyr. Fuck women and their creator! Stop playing! Stop the music! Stop, when I tell you. Is Milos serving in Hungary? Play one of our songs. Good evening. I wanna extend a welcome to everyone here. And I'd like especially to welcome the Djani Rebus Band. Give 'em a big hand! The song I'd like to dedicate to Milos as he goes off to the army is "Time's Up"! - "Karakaj". - Fuck "Karakaj". Never mind. Time's up! I have to go into the army So long. Mom and Dad So long. good old godfather So prepare my farewell party And now for the knockout punch! Momcilo! Momcilo! What is it now? The war's started What are you doing? What? What? The game's on, sweetpea. But I don't feel it! Gotcha, you slut! Godfather Rajko Let out the dog To watch over the house Don't let the wolf get his paws around my Red Riding Hood while I'm away County Tuzla. village of Karakaj That's the place I call home Let's go now. Anybody home? Anyone to see the soldier off? Here I am. Where's Mother? I took her to the hospital. They're keeping her for tests. That allergy come pretty often? It doesn't go away so easily. In some cases, it's for life. Get ready. Don't just stand there. - I'll miss my bus. - Wait! Kiss Mother for me. Wait up! Wait, Milos! You see? Speed is important. The feeling's important. You dropped your wallet, dummy. Speed and feeling are equal. They're part of the same equation. Take care. Kiss Mother for me Damn women! What? I'll put an end to your babbling! Fuck you! Think what you want but Veljo is no fool! - Who says you are? - When I use my head things clear up. People told me, "Veljo, hide your family!" But I didn't. Who told you to? I said Luka's smart, an engineer. He didn't hide his wife. - So why should I? - What? You hid her with the Hungarian. I told my wife, "Off to Serbia with you!" I didn't hide Jadranka. But I saw her leave with the Hungarian. Listen good, the railroad is under military control. From now on, you answer only to us. You're in charge of maintenance and communications. Report all damage to me. That's an order. The tracks must be operational at all times. Understand? Look at her! Where are you going? Want a train to run you over? Go on home! It's useless to talk to you! What did you bring? A bit of everything. What goes into a Bosnian stew? Everything. Milos loves it. Hear those explosions? - They're pounding away. - Milos is being transferred here. - Whereabouts? - To Bosnia. He'll pop in if he's nearby. I'm scared to be in my house alone. I brought a chess set. We can have a game. Good idea. What's that? They're our boys. Hey, soldier! Those aren't our boys! Run! Didn't I say they were pounding away? What is it? Not afraid? Why afraid? They announced a cease-fire. A cease-fire? Fucking cease-fire! They're pounding away! I can't hear anything. You have the first move. I'm black. All right. - Know what my old man used to say? - What? That war always comes quickly. You see it coming. It rolls in like a flood. But it starts by surprise, understand? Yes. Let's play, and the hell with them. Veljo! - Was that a 120mm shell? - Yes. Where'd the Ustasha get them? Genscher sent 'em to the Croats. - Wake up, Luka! - What are you yelling for? - Where's Veljo? He's not home. - Why do you need him? Mobilisation! A rocket launcher consists of the following: the barrel, the rocket inside, front and rear sights, and the launch mechanism. Is that clear? You, young man. Step forward. What in thunderation! We'll do a little test shot. See that isolated tree at 250 metres? That's the target. OK, doll, is that clear? It is. Take aim... Fire! Zowie! What a ricochet! - Good news, your son's here! - Milos! Where? At the house. The captain drove him there. Is that the truth? Why would I lie? Milos! Get down, Zujka! Why are you lying like this? Stretch out. Wait up! Take it easy! Don't overdo it! Where's my Milos hiding? Hey, Veljo! Everything OK at your place? It really shook last night. I lost some roof tiles. You know the real miracle, nothing happened to the Bosnian stew. It just got cold. Oh, my Luka! My boy visits and I give him nothing. What an ass, I fell asleep. - Had any damage? - Come down. I have news. Could you hand me up that long board, there, on the ledge? Come down. I have to tell you something. I can't. Tell me. Come down! It's not about Jadranka. Is it Milos? Is he dead? Tell me. Is he wounded? - No. Come down! - Tell me what happened? I'll murder you if I come down! He's a prisoner. A prisoner? Milos, a prisoner? - How did it happen? - The captain will tell you. Vladan! Get the chopper for the wounded! On the double! Captain! Send your unit to hill 805! He wants to take Milos's place in the unit. - To do what? - To replace Milos. - Transfer me! - You've gone crazy too? - Let's go home. - I don't want to. Listen. I won't leave without a mission. Remember, this isn't your private war. I can't take any more. I'll kill myself. What? - Vladan, get out. - You haven't finished. - Get out. - But you haven't... - Dismissed! - Yes, sir. You'll kill yourself? Too easy. Death doesn't hurt, my friend. It's living that hurts. Did you know I have a brother? Or I had one. I don't know. My Stevan. It's been two years. Two years since he disappeared. He's not among the dead so I can't bury him. He's not among the prisoners. He's not among the living so I can't hug him. The man simply vanished! Vanished into thin air! I asked for a transfer to Lika. Know what they told me? This isn't my private war. It's someone's war, my dear Luka. It's a war for scum. Not yours or mine, for sure. We have good reason to believe that Milos is alive. We'll find him. We'll liberate him. Know how big my Stevan is? Three times my size. Kill me. Who gives a fuck! You wanna get killed, idiot? Luka! Hey, Luka! You owe me a drink. Your Tomo has worked everything out just great! What's so great? Watch this... Nothing up my sleeve and... presto... chango! Up you go, baby! Stretch your legs. See how brave she is. A real revolutionary! See her? What did you do to her? We did nothing. They wandered over to our side in the ambulance. The doctor and the driver we... When I saw her, I knew what I had to do. - What will you do with her? - Exchange her. She writes a letter to her family, we send it over to her side, they give us Milos, we give them the girl, and it's peace in Bosnia! Think it can work? How can it not work? Know her family name? Besirevic! We can get Milos and something extra for her. Does Aleksic know? He won't make a fuss so long as we keep out of his sight. - He has the UNPROFOR coming. - What'll you do with her now? She's out of my hands now. She's your prisoner. I can't keep her. What do you mean? It's only for a week or two at the most. - How will I watch her? - Lock her in a room. We don't have locks on the doors. She's a real dish. See that? I love it when folks communicate! We've met before. Do you remember Smajo? He was a male nurse at the hospital. - Here's a towel. - They shot him. His brains splattered all over the car. All over the seats. They pushed the driver down a gorge. He rolled down like a broken doll. Then that man came up to me and said, "I know what I'm gonna do with you." I shut my eyes and I thought, "That's it. It's the end." I started to shake like a leaf. It's warm in here. Dry yourself off. Your hands and legs. What's happened to all of us? My father always told me that God isn't a blind cat unaware of what he's doing. He knows and sees everything. My son says God didn't play dice when he created the universe. He read that in a magazine. Einstein said it. And now he's a prisoner, too. - Who is? - My son, Milos. Get some rest. Sorry, have your tea. Let's go, Zujka. We're at war. It often happens. The power station is down. Don't be afraid. It's OK. I brought you some breakfast. Would you like to use the tub? How do you say tub? - We call it a bath. - We say bath, too. It's over there. Wait a second. I don't know if there's hot water. The power comes and goes. Let's make a deal. I can't treat you like a prisoner. I know you're from a rich family. - I'm... - I know. Write a nice letter to your people so they know you're here. Then we exchange you. Milos comes home and you go home, too. And Bosnia will be at peace. Be patient. Is it a deal? To end on a pathetic note, as Shakespeare's King Lear did, I think it's ever more clear that the Serbian nation "is more sinned against than sinning." Neighbour! Come in! Be right with you! I've been calling but no one answers. Doing a big cleanup? I didn't ask her to. She's doing it on her own. Come take a look. She says she's bored. Come look at this. You couldn't move around in here before. It's all spick-and-span. Nothing like a woman's touch! A cheese pie! It's almost done. - She do your bedroom, too? - Oh, come on! - Where is she now? - In the hall. - You keep her in the hall? - No, you idiot! She's cleaning it. That's some cleaner! Keep her locked up? No. She's already a prisoner just being here. - But you do tie her up at night? - I don't tie her up. - Did you hide the knives? - Of course not. What for? Personally, I'd be afraid to sleep in this house. She could cut your throat while you're asleep. Cut my throat? She's a normal girl. She's a nurse. A nurse? They first learn to cut throats. I read it in a book, Secrets of War. by Arnold Schwarzenegger. First they slash you like this then pretend to stitch it up. You're full of shit. - Full of shit? - Know how much? - How much? - Past your eyeballs! MayOeO sO Good evening. Where is she going? - To take a bath. - A bath? I haven't had one since the war started. I can believe it. - Nor do I intend to. - I can believe that, too. Know how to play chess? No? Then what are you doing here? Get out! Shame on you! You have no manners! See that? A lovely girl! It suits you better than Jadranka. Who said you could touch her clothes? I'm sorry. Who said you could? Don't gape at me like that! Did you ask permission? Did you ask for permission? How dare you help yourself without asking? Take that off! Take that off right now! Where are you going? Come back here. She makes herself at home! As if she owned the place! The nerve of the bitch! Take these! Stop crying? Touch her things again and I'll kill you! Is that clear? I'll give you my clothes. They're clean. - I have clothes... - Shut up! Get up quick! Go and change. Use my belt if it's too big. And write that exchange letter. Why so hard on the girl? She wants to dress up and I don't even know if Milos is alive! Shall we have that pie now? Forget the pie. First the letter. Get upstairs. Write your people you're fine. They should search their prisons for Milos. For an exchange. Write all that. It's my sister-in-law's. See if anything fits. Take your pick. She doesn't need them. She left for Germany. She'll buy more stuff there. I'm not worried about her. Sabaha... - Can I ask you something? - Go ahead. Do you have a boyfriend? Why do you ask? Are you promised to someone? Girls still do that here? I haven't gone out with girls in a long time. How do I look? You look fine. How do you like this one? Here they come again, the businessmen patriots! Now we'll get better acquainted. Luka! What are you doing? - As you can see. - Sealing up the tunnel! You spent a year opening it and now you seal it. - It was an order. - An order? - How will the freight train pass? - That's why I'm closing it. Did the order come from Aleksic? Yes. There's no food or medicine around but plenty of oil and cigarettes. We didn't build this line for smugglers. Aleksic the idealist! You know what wise people say - "No one's candle burns till dawn." Sabaha! - Are you asleep? - No, I'm not. You know, I had a great friend at college. - Tell me about him. - He was a Muslim. Stay here, Zujka. Zaim from Vakuf. - You say "mate"? - We also say "mate". He liked railroads, too. A great guy! The things we went through together! And never an argument! He was like my right hand. There's no one like him among Serbs. Nor among Muslims, I'm sure. You asleep, Sabaha? I'm not asleep. - Want me to go on? - Go on. Luka, I'm scared. Can I come into your room? Sure. Why not? I've met a lot of Muslims. Ever meet a Muslim girl? What do you mean? Sure I did. Is that Nada's nightie? Yes. Should I take it off? No, why should you take it off? It's a nice nightie. It's OK. Shame on you! You'll get a backache like that. Come up here. That's enough of you. Out you go! Don't be afraid. It'll stop. I'll go back when it's over. Do you smell like that or is it Nada's nightie? How do your people say "blues"? We don't say it. Oh, Luka, what are we going to do? - Janjus! - Yes, sir. Eliminate that nest! What? The Muslims are advancing. Run for it! - Why? What's happening? - Don't ask! Everyone's on the run! - And our army? - Aleksic is helping civilians. - That's no way to fight. - You're trying to teach me? - Run! - But the railway! Screw the railway! Run for your life! I won't leave without you. Hold on, engineer! The girl's a Muslim. Captain Aleksic says if anything happens to her he'll kill you. Got that? Follow me, engineer. Don't be afraid. You heard what Aleksic said. I'm cold. You studied nursing? Veljo! - Yes, I did. - Why? - Petkovic's sister-in-law is in labour. - There's no doctor? I wouldn't be here otherwise. Go and be careful. Go on if you can manage it. Hot water, quick! Heat it up! I need a sheet, too. See the baby? Look at his hair. Isn't he cute? She was great! Petkovic can't get over it. She really saved the day. I'll go ask Aleksic if we keep running or go back. I borrowed accessories. What accessories? For shaving. I was thinking... your sideburns look more like boots. Boots? Well, if they really look like boots, then off they come! You're starting to creep into my soul. How will I ever part with you? - Why part with me? - For the exchange. The letter should've arrived by now. The Besirevics must've reacted. I have to tell you something. What? I'm not one of those Besirevics. - What do you mean? - My dad's old and retired. He doesn't know any VIPs and they don't know him. But the letter! You made me write it. - But you said... - I didn't say anything. That was Tomo. When he heard my name he said, "I know you Besirevics. You're all beys." "I know you like the back of my hand. You're strong as death." You should have told me! - I was afraid of you. - You were afraid? And now you're not afraid? - A little afraid. - A little afraid? You've led me up the garden path. So you're a little afraid? Don't, Luka. I'm sorry. "I'm sorry"? I don't want your "sorry". All I've heard from you is "I'm sorry!" and "I'm afraid!" Have you ever given Milos a thought? Who can he say "I'm sorry" to? That he's afraid? You only watch your own ass! So what if Milos is rotting in prison! No, Luka! It's not my fault! Not your fault? We lost so much time. We might have got him out by now. It's my fault. I'm sorry. As far as I'm concerned, you've no reason to be afraid now. You're no longer my prisoner. You're nothing to me. I'm nothing to you? That's right, you're free as a bird. Hear what I said? You're free to go. The Petkovics will bless you. Go to Veljo, he can help you. Did you hear me? Get lost! Is it really you? This was my late father's house. I was born here. Have a look. Shall I clean up a bit? Clean up? Love? This isn't for your eyes, old girl. You've had enough for a lifetime. It's like a drug. God spare me that. When I saw you today I thought, "Dear God!" I had a woman. Milica from Vis. - So her name was Milica? - Something like that. She saw these big grapes at the Z vornik market. The ones with seeds like... Pardon my language. - Don't spoil my dinner. - No. Like pigeon shit. She said, "Bring me those grapes and I'll be yours." I got her the grapes. She was so happy. She took me by the hand and led me up to the hayloft. The hay smells wonderful up there. It seems to beckon to you. Get to the point. I will but I don't want to be vulgar. How do you say it? You made love. That's it. I made love and she ate grapes. That's when I got fundamentally disappointed. You're far from the railroad. I almost didn't find you. - Where have you been? - Filipovic wants me dead. - How do you know that? - Through Tomo. You know, he's AC/DC. You can lie low here. You know too much. Do you mean... I'm in danger, too? You can blow the whistle on him. You know all the profits he's made! So... we don't have a choice. Nope. You know, it's him or us. Just tell us how to get to Tunnel 46. I know who sealed it up. That jerk-off did it! He mined the tunnel. What do I do with him? I'll fuck him good. Is this number 0190 This is Hotline Lily. Are you calling from a satellite phone? Of course, I am. Your credit card number. One moment, please. - Hello, pussycat. - Who is this? I've been waiting to hear from you. I'm so excited! I'm a Serbian stallion. Cut it out! I have a big dick. Big calibre. That's nice! Where are you, honey? Oh, fuck! I speak a little bit of German. That's not a problem. Come on. Let's play. Ow C'mon, my Serbian stallion. Let me have it! Slower! Faster! Faster! We killed a man, Vujan. Forget that. We have to get rid of your fever. Have some tea. Could you kill a man, Sabaha? Know what my father says? "If I were hungry and had a chicken, it'd be hard for me to kill it, but I would if I had to." I'm not talking about a chicken. Do you see my Milos, Vujan? As soon as I close my eyes I see Milos, too. He's alive. Alive? He's putting his hand to his head as if he were thinking of something. He's quite a boy. I can see him clearly. When the forest was ours, Father and I came here every day. He dragged you here Sundays too like you drag me? Sundays too. Neighbour! Good news! Luka, good news! Thank God I can deliver good news to someone. - About Milos? - Not Milos, but that will come. Take a guess. It's Jadranka. Your wife is back, my dear Luka. I knew everything would work out. Shall we have a game to celebrate the occasion? Milos will be home. Know who I met? Captain Aleksic. He gave me his word that Milos had been found and that he's all right. It's all a matter... of procedure. Look at this mess. But it will be fine. Just look at this bed. Oh, my Luka! You can tell there's no woman around. Shall I make coffee? Beg your pardon? - Did Veljo speak to me? - Coffee and schnapps, to celebrate! This doesn't happen every day. With or without sugar? Sugar. For me, too. Is she with Veljo? She's nothing to Veljo. You know, I'm not crazy. - Good. - Beautiful, too. Where did you find her? They brought her to Luka for an exchange. That's when I met her. I knew your Luka was a great man, Jadranka, but this time he outdid himself. The way he watches over her and takes care of her! The way he protects her! Are you cold? He's with her day and night. What's your name? A Muslim. We give them Sabaha, they give us Milos. Who is she? Who is this hussy? I'm not a hussy. Come over here. - Take those clothes off! - Stop it! You stay here! You, over there! How dare you meddle in my life! Must our son come home to find that whore in this house? Shame on you! You prefer the cymbalist? Don't mention that asshole! He played his swan song? - But she's a lovely girl! - I'm shaking! Sit here. Veljo, will you shut up! - Why should I shut up? - You're full of shit! I'll carve my name on your ass, you little bitch! Stop it! Enough of this! You won't stain our father's honourable house! - Back inside! - Not this household! So long as the Djukics live, I, Jadranka ne Radovanovic, won't allow it, you little whore! What are you saying? Luka, can't you see she put a Muslim curse on your pillow! - I'm so worried! - You, worried? Try to help a bit and you eat shit! Go home, Luka. Leave me alone. - I won't go home alone. - You're not alone now. I'm alone, I tell you. If only the train came... Would you leave? I would just sit here. What's wrong, girl? Who'd stay with me then? Let's go. It's cold. - We have nowhere to go. - We have plenty of places to go. We'll go to Australia. That far enough? - By railway? - Sure. But walking along the tracks. OK. After this tunnel, there's a slight incline. A four per cent incline. 700 ties. - You know how many ties? - I know everything here. Then comes a curve. Then over the Rzav and straight on to the Drina. What's that? Engineer! - Vladan! - The captain's waiting for you. I've seen enough madness in this war. - Be reasonable. - I am, but I won't let her go. Your wife's back and Milos will be, too. - Let the girl go. - I won't. Both sides are exchanging prisoners. She's on UNPROFOR's list. If you don't let her go... The jeep's here to take her to the Red Cross. They'll check her name. - No way! Stay back! - Don't shoot. You out of your mind? Not that way! This way! Downhill to the Drina! Watch out for the mines! - Watch out! - I'll fall! That's the Drina! It's so wide. It seemed small from above. Were you serious about us going to Australia? Sure. We just cross the Drina into Serbia. The Chetnik takes his cow grazing. I have to pee. She's no cow, idiot. That's Romeo and Juliet. You ain't got no culture. - How do we get across? - You'll see. What the fuck is that? What does he feed her? Australia. I dreamed of the Drina once. I was sitting on the bank watching the river flow by. It was flowing but I felt uneasy about something. - What about me? - You came later. Then something crazy dawned on me. I thought: "It can't just flow like this." "It has to stop somewhere." - I wanted to see that. - Did it stop? It stopped. For a second, but still! You could walk over it from Bosnia into Serbia. - It dried up? - No, it just stopped for a second. - It turned and flowed uphill. - Were you scared? Me scared? Who do you think I am? No more pissing in the Drina! Our Drina is Mecca and Medina! Hey, Chetnik! We bled your Chetnik girl, and now we're gonna bleed you, too. - I'm going to die. - No, you won't. Don't be afraid. Know when you'll get to Goradze? Never! What would we do in Australia? What would we do here? I like this brook. So do I. What would we do there? How would we live? I worked it all out. It's a big country with not many railroads. - And if you can't? - Can't what? Build a railroad. Maybe they don't need it. How can they not need a railroad? Look at Japan. Nothing but railroads! Come on. Aleksic is waiting. Lean back. I have to stop the bleeding. I have to tighten it. Will we have children there? Sure we will. Aleksic! Come quick! Quick! - What's up? - Don't ask. - Quick, find her vein! - She bleed a lot? All day long. Hurry! - What's her blood type? - I don't know. Can I give mine? Hurry! We'll go vein to vein. Pump quickly. - You'll be accountable. - Yes. Keep talking to her. Look at me. Do you know that there's no winter in Australia? You go into the water when you want. You can swim as much as you like. It's at the end of the earth. No one can bother you. - No one? - No one. There's a beach where penguins go every night. At 7:55, one shows up, and at 8:00 there are thousands. They walk around the beach. People watch them and they watch people and walk around. - Take me there? - Every day. - And the kids? - Of course. A friend working in Russia once fucked a penguin. - There are no penguins in Russia. - But he caught one. He said it felt ecstatic. Sheep and goats screech like crazy. A penguin just stands there! - She can see it here. - You know where it is? - See that globe? - Move it closer. Stick a nail in where we are, it would come out in Australia. God, 7.9 mm! - How's her pulse? - Weak. Oxygen, quick! It will be all right, I tell you. What are her chances? - Slim. We're doing our best. - That woman mustn't die. - We're doing our best. - Remember that! Aleksic got our papers ready. He'll take us to Belgrade, honest he will. I got some money from him. Enough for the trip. After we get airsick pills, we'll still have enough for two tickets. You won't need two. Don't fall asleep! Wake up! Doctor, her heart stopped. Do something! Oxygen, quick! Delibasic Damir! Pasic Zeljko! - I'm cold. - I'll get my coat. For our Milos. I'm accompanying her! That woman needs a coat. I don't see my Luka. I didn't even say goodbye. Luka, come here. Stop! Stop, soldier! You can't just shoot him. I don't want to go home! Let her by. This how you show your joy? You're not crying again! - How can I not cry? - Never a spark of intelligence! What's she saying? Forget her. She's a dope. Mother! Milos, you're alive! Dandelions! What did we do to deserve this? It's springtime. Geese, Mother. Don't you see that hawk? Are the roots intact? Leave our geese alone, you beast! They slashed my ball. Fuck them! Milos is smart as hell. If they didn't hurt his head, he'll be a Tesla. Yes, he's smart. But try to be smart your whole life and in the end you can't prove anything. It's all theory. After Hiroshima, there's no more theory. My dear captain, Hiroshima is in our house! It's all in your head. It's got nothing to do with Hiroshima. I know what's in your head. No, you don't. I do. I was in love once, too. You know, I finished military school and got a rank. My brother had a daughter. And I fell in love. Then, of course, bang! I was transferred. Then the war came. What is it, Milos? - A piece of shit! - What piece of shit? A human turd. On the pillow. That's good luck, son. There's something sick about falling in love. You don't see the sense of things any more. - Have you looked for her? - How? By magic? I'm a soldier and she's in another country. You're different, Luka. You're not a damn soldier like me. You're not the enemy. Let's go by headquarters. Oh, Captain, someone screwed up. Someone miscalculated. Because the bullet is slower than a satellite signal.
