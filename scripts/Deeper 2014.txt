We're doing a documentary. Wonder if you have a second to chat. I don't know, I'm like on my way to work right now. We were just wondering if we could ask you a couple of questions. What kind of question's that? If I give you, you know, something like that maybe you come in here and answer the questions for us? Ah, that's a bit weird. What if I offered you Little bit of cash? A little bit of cash? All right. Hey, you like that? Oh, just take it. All right, thank you so much for helping us out. I bet you don't have any trouble at the clubs, do you? We don't have much trouble. You seem like a fun girl. You like to party? You know, you have a lot of layers on. It's cold outside. So, what are you up to today? I'm walking home from school. Walking home from school, very nice. School girl. Hah, that's always hot. - When was the last time you had sex? Well, that's why we broke up. It's been a while. Now what you got under that hoodie? Why don't you take that off? It's hot in here. It was a fishing boat. He had a fishing boat? Yeah. Let's see a little bit more skin. So can you take your shirt off? Question one. Question one? - Depends, what kind of cash do you have? Oh, okay. Look at you, little business lady. Ooh oh oh! You see that oh? She wants it right away. What do I gotta do for this? I want you to look at the camera and say "Hi, daddy". Hi, daddy. All right baby, see you later! Yeah, that's right, bitch! We got your money! So degrading. Ugh, you're telling me! - How am I supposed to come back from North Korea and do a piece like this? You said you wanted a break from the horrors of dictatorship, and I believe the term you used was "fluff piece". - Well, this is a little on the nose, don't you think? Boss thought it was funny. Not funny at all. So, what? You're not interested or you think the wife will give you shit? Both. - Come on, Mark, my spidey senses are tingling here. I think we have some actual angles. These guys have started their own little smut empire. Yeah, but who cares? What, you don't watch porn? Nope. Come on! Not like this! I don't know. Don't puss out on me. - I just can't believe there's a market for this garbage. - These guys offer something different. They pick up random girls and coax them into having sex. Well, that's bullshit. Exactly! First we prove that these girls are total plants, then we springboard into a serious psychoanalytical and social commentary piece on internet porn. You're hilarious. Why do you have such a hard on for these guys, dude? - Because these guys objectify women, dude. Aren't they paying us? Fuck 'em. They want exposure. They didn't say what kind. I've seen stuff that's worse than this, and I know you have too. At least no one's dying here. Yeah. At least no one's dying. Yeah, you gotta have off. Yeah, I mean, with this weather, are you kidding me? Ugh, it's the wife. Hold on a sec. Hey, babe, how you feeling? Ah, no. There's some crazy weather coming into Seattle so they rerouted us to Portland, and we were having a hard time getting a flight, but my co-producer extraordinaire got us the best pilot on the west coast and he's gonna fly us in right now. I'll be back in like 48 hours. I know, I know. Look, it's an easy one, okay? I love you too. Okay, take care of that bun in the oven. I can't believe we're meeting these guys on a street corner. You tell the wife? Ah, not yet. Pussy. Excuse me. You know what's crazy is I have no idea what to expect right now. Oh! That's camera. What up, beautiful people? You the guy from Xice Magazine? Yeah, I'm Mark. What's with the last-minute location change? I thought we were doing this interview at your office. - Yeah, I just thought it'd be better for the story, get to know me a little bit better, see me in my element, a little bit of atmosphere. Who is this? This is Sue. - Hi, Susan Chen, Mark's videographer. Videographer? Yeah. - I thought you worked for a magazine. Yeah, we shoot everything for the online magazine, and then that saves me having to take notes. - Ah, you're not gonna like this, but that's a no-go. It's only our cameras allowed in the van, I mean, unless little Suzie Chu here wants to get naked and play around with Johnny-boy. Suzie what?! - Um, look, we worked this out with your people weeks ago. - What can I say, the rules are the rules. Are we gonna have a problemo, or what? Ah, I dunno. Let me just have a chat with my partner. Okay? Sure. Love watching you leave, Suzie Choo-choo-choose me. Oh, that's a good one. Ugh. I want to punch that guy in the face. I can't believe they get girls into that van. I know. - Ugh, now they've got the camera on us. That guy's an asshole. - Well, that's exactly how I'm gonna make him look. You're gonna stay? I'm here. Oh, shit. Mark smells a story. All right, well, I still get paid? Of course. Okay, have fun. I'm sure it's gonna be a tough day for you. Yeah, yeah, fuck off. I'll see you at the office. See ya! So, gentlemen. So, what's the plan? - Well, we're gonna make a movie. You ready? Really? It's a little early for porn, isn't it? Yeah, right. Actually in our industry, the early worm catches the bird, if you get my drift. Very clever. All right. Hop in. Back here? Yeah. - So, this is where the magic happens? Yeah, watch out for stains. All right, introductions. This here is my boy John. I got him doing double duty today. He's going to be driving and fucking, 'cause you're an extra body, and an artist needs his space to work. 'Sup, man? 'Sup, man. So, you really do this at 10 AM? God damn right. - All right, Johnny-boy, start the engine. These hoes ain't gonna come to us. All right. Woo! Yeah baby, let's do it! - So, gentlemen, how does this usually work? We just drive around until we find a cute girl who wants to have sex in the back of a van at 10 in the morning? Well, yeah, pretty much, and I'm ready to get my dick wet. - I'd rather you not do that, man. - Oh, what, you don't like it either? What's the story behind that? - Well, the story is I'm interviewing you, so. - Lighten up, buddy, it's just a camera. You want and interview or not? - I think you need me more than I need you. - I didn't know this was a pissing contest. You're making it one. Really? Well, how far did you fly to be here with us, Mark? - I've flown a lot further than this, Steve. I though it wasn't a pissing contest. Look. This interview can go two ways, right? Either you give me full access, we have some fun, I write a nice article, and your company gets more exposure, or... we do the opposite. My publisher talked to your company. Money might have exchanged hands, it doesn't matter, either way, I'm here because you guys wanted more publicity, right? So if it's gonna be a no, I'd rather know now, before I have to see your boy John naked. - Oh, you want to see John naked. My dick is magnificent. - It's up to you, man, what do you think? All right, chief, fire away. Great. Okay, so, where should we start? How long you been employed? - What, you didn't do your homework? It's three years. Before that you were in the film industry, but I just needed it for the record. Bingo! - How much money you guys making off the website? A lot. What's a lot? A lot is a lot, man. Jesus Christ. A lot's a lot. What about you, John? What got you into the porn business? - Mm, 'cause I get to nail hot chicks all day. That's why I do this shit. Okay, what about you, Steve? What about me? Why'd you start this business? - 'Cause I get to film my buddy Holmes Junior here? Whoa, hell yeah, mothafucker! - Why do you call him Holmes Junior? - Well, you know that porn star John Holmes? Yeah. - Well, my dick is a quarter of an inch shorter than his. This close. That's lovely. So what about you, Mark? - What, are you asking my dick size too? Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Check out this one. Look at her ass, holy shit. Up here. Yeah, she has got a serious case of RCA. What's RCA? - Raging cock addiction, and bad. Oh my god, wow. Dude, we gotta come back for her. Yeah, we will, just calm down, cowboy. - So these girls that you pick up off the street, you rehearse with them before you shoot, or...? No, no rehearsals. It's actually pretty simple. We just pick them up, we offer them some money, they take off their clothes, and Johnny-boy here sticks them with his dick. They fuck for a buck. Exactly, yeah. We can get them to do anything we want them to do. Come on. Believe it, bro. Yeah, see, the trick is everybody else uses pros. We're the only bona fide amateur porn station. The ladies agree out of pure charm and seduction. Seduction or manipulation? Uh, seduction. Okay, we'll call it seduction. What kind of seduction are we talking about? - Well, that's why you're here, Mark. You're here to bear witness. I, Steve Coulter, am the most persuasive prick in the business! I'm the only guy with 100% amateur rating. Like, you know how guys, they're really good at math? Or they can play the piano, or painting the Sistine Chapel or something? They're blessed with abilities that nobody knows why they have them. Ah, idiot savants? He's funny. - Yeah, I don't know about the idiot part, but savants, geniuses, call it whatever you will, but for whatever reason, I was blessed with the peerless ability to get women to take off their clothes and fuck. I'm not good at much, but at this, I'm a fucking ninja. I am the master. I could do it in my sleep. I mean, I didn't have you come here to make me more money, man. Look around. We're doing fine. I want someone to capture this for pure posterity. - Oh, hey, hey, whoa, look at these two. Whoa, wait, two? Is there a problem? - No, this is where you watch and learn. All right. Hey, excuse me, ladies. Do you have a second? What is it? - We're film students doing a documentary on the neighborhood and we were wondering if we could ask you a couple of questions? Like a survey? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like a survey. We could throw you a little bit of cash. We're kind of in a tough spot, 'cause we need to hand it in by tomorrow. All right. Shoot. All right. Well, just hop in. In there? - Yeah! Yeah, in here. Why not? What did my parents say about getting into vans with strangers? Oh, come on. We're not kidnappers or pedophiles, we're just three handsome dudes. What's the worst that could happen? All right, fine. I'll offer you a little bit more in cash, okay? How's that look? You like that? Okay. See? So easy, just hop in. Beautiful. Thank you. All right, well, I'm Steve, this is John, and this here is Mark. Hi. I'm Sam. This is Beth. So, what do you do? I'm a writer. For documentaries? No, I'm a journalists. - Yeah, actually, Mark here, he writes the questions for us. Ask me a question. - Okay, why did you choose to get in a van full of strangers for a bunch of money? Education. Of course. Okay, okay, all right. Johnny-boy, hit the gas. Let's do this. So, ladies. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mark. Let's get to know these girls a little bit better. Look at Sam. Isn't she beautiful? Sam, you're fucking smoking hot, if you don't mind me saying. But I guess you hear that all the time, don't you? Yeah. Yeah, I knew it. So, are you from around here? Born and raised. All right, we got ourselves another local. Another local? You guys do this often? Shit. You look familiar. Really? Yeah. Have you ever been on camera before? Yeah, like something dirty? You two know each other? No. - So, you guys are all strangers? You've never met? Wanna get to know me? - Yes, yes, Sam, I want to get to know you. To tell you the truth, I couldn't give a shit about getting a good grade on this doc for school, 'cause now that you're a couple burners in my van and the camera rolling, well, it's it's got me thinking. Could you two hold hands? I'll pay extra. - I thought this was a documentary. I have a nice secluded spot, we could park and nobody'll bother us. - How much money are we talking about? Hold on. Can you two make out? I wanna know if you two can make out, and then we'll talk business. You want us to kiss? - You kind of want to kiss each other, don't you? Just close friends getting closer. I don't know. This is pretty weird. Well, it's a cliche, I mean, you're in a van with a bunch of guys who want to watch you kiss your friend, but I'm not asking you to do anything dangerous. I mean, isn't it on your bucket list? Do something naughty, once in your life? Feel your heart racing? All right. Sure. All right. Oh yeah. Oh, yeah, that's nice. That's really nice. Nice. That's really nice. Okay, now do it again. Okay, now how much are you paying them for this? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, just let it be, all right? And now we're in fantasy land. Yeah, Steve. How much are you paying us for this? Hold on. Beth, can you pull down Sam's top and give her a little kiss there? I don't know. Can't people see through the windows? No, no, no, no, no, no. These windows are really tinted. Maybe... maybe somewhere else? - Well, I gotta see the merchandise first, before I set value if you catch my drift. All right. Atta girls. Let's have some fun. You like fun do you? Oh, yes, yes I do. Oh yeah. Yeah, look at those little pups. Beautiful, Sam, beautiful. Okay, Beth, now it's your turn. Okay. Really? But not here. Seriously? Sorry, who are you again? I'm a writer. Yes, he's a writer. This is where we turn. Okay, great. I just need you girls to sign a couple release forms. Here you go. It's for the documentary. Oh, the documentary. - Wait a minute, let me get this straight. You guys are walking down the street, we roll up, and now you're willing to let us film you in the back of a van? For money? Sure. You're killing me here, Mark. - You're not very much fun, Mark. Where were you two going today? The mall. The mall? You wanna see our tits or not? - Oh, yeah, bring me the boobies. Easy. Find a place to pull over, buddy, and I'll get you all the boobies you can shake a stick at. Okay, Sam, I want you to bend over. I want you to show us that ass a little bit. Oh shit that's hot. That's nice. You like that? Oh, shit, that is hot. Okay, now, I want you to pull that top off. Okay, but I want you to do it real slow. Really slow. There we go. Atta girl. John, you seeing this? That's some good stuff, man. Yeah, daddy likes it. Here's the pull over. Perfect. Just take us in a little bit, then get back here and show these girlies what Holmes Junior's all about. All right, good girl, Sam, good girl. Okay, now, Beth, want you to get in the shot. Want you to pull down that bra, okay? Okay? Hey, Beth? Beth? What the fuck! Hey! Don't fucking move. Fucker. Hurry up, Sam, we need to get moving. I am. He's heavy! Oh god. What the fuck is going on? Shut the fuck up! Not so tough now, are you? Who are you? - Do you believe in karma, Steve? No! I'm like the Seal Team Six of karma. Get their phones. Hey, hey... And tie their hands. Who's this? It's my wife. She's pregnant. Yeah, we're due in two weeks. Listen, I was flown in here from New York, okay There's an X-Bus in New York? No. I am here doing a story on them for a magazine! Yeah, bullshit. It's not bullshit. You can check in my bag, my wallet's in there. Give me his wallet. Listen to me. Look, you can let me go. I'm not gonna say anything. You're a fucking journalist! Shut the fuck up, man! You write everything down! - This has nothing to do with you! It's what you fucking do! Shut up! Shut up! Unless you are being asked a question, you say nothing. I have a family, lady, okay? I don't work with these What the fuck did I just say? No! Okay! Okay! Get up. Get up. Get in the van. Put him in the back. Get up. Slowly. Move, move! Here. Sit down. All right, I need you to tell me exactly what you're doing here. - I told you, my magazine hired me to do a story on these perverts. Why? - Because they paid my company some money for exposure. Why you? - I've done a bunch of crazy stories. I've been to some wild places. And now I'm in the woods with a gun pointed at me. - Yeah, well, you weren't supposed to be here. Well, then let me go. Well, you're involved! Not by choice! Fuck! What? It's not exactly going the way I wanted it to. These things never do. Now that guy is dead, and I need to see this through because I made a promise. To who? Who did you make a promise to? You can stop this. It is never too late. Look, my company has some of the best lawyers in the country. We get people out of hot water all the time. I can help you out of this. Yeah, I've heard that before. Men are full of shit. I'm not full of shit. All men are full of shit! Just hear me out. Please. Did Steve do something to you? You could say that. Hey, babe. Think you could help me out? I got something caught in my eye. Thank you. Did he hurt you? Listen, I can do an article about this, okay? We can do an exclusive. I can tell your story and we can get you a lot of attention, you just need to tell me what this is about. - Hey, you wanna tell me what's going on here? I don't know anything. Hey come on, you can tell me. Hey, listen, what are you getting paid today? I'll double it, okay? And then I'll double it again. You just gotta tell me what's going on here. Who is this bitch? She's not a bitch. - All right, all right, your friend. Okay. She's a friend of yours. Why'd you invite her to the shoot? She looks out for me. - I know you feel trapped right now, and I know you feel the only way out is to go deeper, but that is not the answer. Come on, just talk to me, okay? I can help you out of this. You can trust me. This conversation's over. No, listen to me. Get up! Just tell me what he did! - If you don't start listening to me, we're gonna have a problem. Don't fucking cross me. - You don't have to point that at me. That's not necessary. Shut the fuck up. Move! Hey! Oh shit! What was that? What were you saying to him? - This has gotten completely out of control. - You don't think I don't know that? ...who the fuck that is, and it really doesn't help that you're running around in there with Steve. Keep quiet! I'm trying to hear what they're saying. - Augh, we gotta get the fuck out of here. That's not gonna happen, man. - Fine, there's a gun in the glove box. Whoa, hey. Tell me what you did to her. Me? I don't know that fucking bitch! - Well she sure as fuck knows you. And I know you planted them on the street, so you must know them. - There was only supposed to be one girl, okay? One girl! Sam! I don't know who that other fucking chick is! Knew it. - Oh, go fuck yourself, all right! What does it matter now? - Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We gotta play it cool, okay? If she wanted us dead, we'd already be dead. I don't think she knows what her next move is. Let's not force her hand. Get out of my way. What are you doing, man? You're gonna get us both killed, man. - Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? Just fucking stand there? - I'm gonna find out what she wants, okay? If we give her what she wants, I think we're gonna be okay. "We're gonna be okay"? "We're gonna be okay"?! Look at this guy! He's my best fucking friend, and he's dead, and we're fucking next! If you hadn't attacked her, he'd still be alive right now. Fuck you, all right. You gotta be kidding me. What? It's fucking locked. Okay, well, listen. Let's just, let's just calm down, okay? Let's think about this. Fuck this stupid-ass shit. Help! What are you doing? Help! - Shut up. - Help! Help! Help! Help, please! Please help me! Shut the fuck up! Please! Shut up! You shut the fuck up! Please help me! - Dude, she's coming, she's coming! - I told you not to fucking cross me. Get the fuck up. Sam! Come here. Over there. Trying to run on me, Mark? And here I was starting to think you were on my side. Sam. Sam, pay attention. Take this taser. If he moves or does anything, you do this. Got it? Yes. Good. Stay put. Steve? Okay. You need to start talking now. Steve Coulter. Born February 21st, 1989. You're lying to me. She trusts you. You know that girl. I don't know anything! That is bullshit, okay! I wanna get the fuck out of this van, right fucking now! Stop! So, what? Is she forcing you to do this? Just please stop. - I have nothing to do with this, and I am stuck here, okay? I have a family that I want to see again! I need you to help me. Shh! She'll be back soon. Your name's Sam, right? Do you know Steve? No. But you know Beth, right? I can't talk to you. Tell me what she wants. She wants him! Who the fuck is Beth, Sam? She's a friend! What kind of a friend? A new friend. Graduated 2007. Parents divorced in 2009. I know everything about you, Steve. Not so smart now, are you? Fucking die right here, you slut! She approached me. We became friends. She told me she needed my help. We've been through some of the same things. - If you think you can just sit here and be an innocent bystander, you're wrong. - I didn't think it was gonna be like this. I didn't want anyone to die. - We can help each other get out of this alive, okay? Do you understand me? I need your help. - It's Steve. She just wants Steve. Oh yeah? I don't think she's just gonna let us walk out of here. What were you two doing? What? Sam? He was asking me questions. What was he asking you about? How we met. - And you didn't tell him anything, did you? No. - Trying to get information on me? - Nothing I wouldn't ask you to your face. - You better slow it down, Sherlock, because the more you know, the less chance there is of you getting out of here and getting on Oprah. I love Oprah. Get on your knees. Both of you get on your knees! Face away from each other. Tie them together. - What magazine to you write for? It's called Xice Magazine. It's like a indie pop culture magazine. Indie pop culture magazine - Stop fucking entertaining him, Sam! Are you done? Get up here. We need to get moving. There's so much blood. Well, clean it up. With what? Do I have to do everything? Do you know why they call the internet the web? Because it's spun by spiders like you, Steve. - You're a crazy bitch, you know that? - Do you know how many hits Steve gets a month? Yeah. - Don't you fucking talk to her, man! Six million hits. Did you ever read Charlotte's Web, Steve? - Who the fuck cares about Charlotte's Web? It's a children's novel. In it the spider, Charlotte, writes messages in her web, which ends up saving the pig's life. Ah, that's wonderful. You need to start to listen to me. Do you understand me? Because I am the spider now, and I will write those messages about you for the world to see, do you hear me? Sam, start the car. Drive. Where are we going? Deeper. Deeper? Where the fuck are you thinking... Beth? Beth! People. Hikers or something. Go around. Motherfucker! Shit, Beth! Beth! Beth! Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. What's up? Your van almost hit a tree. Oh, yeah. Hit a sharp rock or something back there. I think I blew a tire. Mark. Do you remember that conversation we had earlier? If you wanna live and you want these hikers to live, you'll close your eyes, and you think happy thoughts. Shut up! Well, you need a hand? It's fine. Thanks though. - Yeah, have you seen anyone else out here? No, nothing. You got everything you need? Spare tire? Yeah. Should be good. Oh, you're not alone. Hey. No, she's in good hands. Yeah, just the two of us. - You guys headed out to Eagle Lake? Maybe. What are you guys way out here for? Hiking? Camping? Camper van. - Is that blood on the windshield? No, it's mud. - That's on the inside, that's not It's mud. You guys sure you're okay? - I think maybe you should leave now. Excuse me? - I said get the fuck out of here. I'm sorry. Look, we're just having a bad day. She didn't mean it. Thank you for your concern. Come on, honey. It's not worth it. No. It's not. Dude. What's going on? It's Susan. Rebecca keeps calling me. I don't know what to tell her. Call me. Call me, call me, call me, call me. - What the fuck just happened out there? - You idiots just got two people killed. Are you fucking serious? You have gone too far. You have crossed a line. Hey! Are you listening to me? Shut up. Sam, you can do it. You can do it. I can't. I need you to turn around. You can do it. Sam! Sam! Don't listen to her! I told you not to talk to her. - You killed two people in cold blood. Jesus Christ! I had no choice. Sam! Is it on? Yes, it is. Are you rolling? Yes, I think so. Put this in your mouth. Put this in your mouth and swallow it! What are you doing? - We're gonna make a video, boys. Are you awake in there, Steve? Now I need you to look into the camera. I want you to tell us your full name, and who you are. I'm Steve Coulter. Why are you doing this? No. "My name is Steve Coulter, and I am a rapist". Say it! Fuck you! - "My name is Steve Coulter, and I am a rapist". Say it! - My name is Steve Coulter and I am a rapist! Yes you are, Steve. And how many girls have you raped? - This is bullshit, I haven't raped anyone. Wrong. How many girls? It's not rape, okay? I pay them! - And what about before your fucking business? What about in college? You ever rape anyone when you were in college, Steve? No! Wrong! (Steve screams. You know, I could do this for real. Just go further and further into the woods with you. No one knows you're out here. No one even knows you're fucking missing! So why don't you tell me what this feels like on your dick? I don't I don't touch the girls. I just film them. My hands are clean. Check the tapes. I have. Then get out of my face, okay? You're barking up the wrong tree. I don't think so. - I sell videos of consenting adults having sex. Since when is that illegal? - Have you ever used gamma-hydroxybutyric acid? What is that? GHB. - Never! - Ever? All right, all right! Okay, okay, yes. Maybe once. Shhh. Close the door, close the door. What are we doing? Shut the fuck up. what do we do now? Take off her shirt. Nice and easy. There we go, there we go. Kenny, shut the fuck up. Me? Yeah, you. Shhh. It's that voice. It's that fucking voice behind the camera that makes it all happen. - This is entrapment and you know it. Oh, call it whatever you want. You're fucking guilty. Here we go. Okay, turn her over. Yeah. All right. Johnny-boy, you first. Okay, here we go. I'll flip her over. Okay. Make it hurt. Yeah. Right. Shit. I don't keep count. - And these videos are on your website? No. Yes! Which is it? - You can only access it if you have a special password. - So people pay extra to see these videos? Good boy, Steve. Mark? How you doing there, big boy? How you holding up there? Those pills I gave you, they making you feel pretty good? What are you doing? - I have you a male enhancement drug. What? Why? There you are. Do you like me Mark? Or is that just a banana in your pants? - I have nothing to do with this, okay? I have nothing to do with this! I know. I know, but John's dead, so I need you to stand in for him, okay? Stop it. You do not tell me what to do, do you understand me? Augh! - Steve, I want you to feel what one in six women feels every year. I've given you all you want. What more do you need from me? - I don't need any more information from you, shit head, but I will take something else. Smile for the camera. What? - Doing all right over there, babe? Remind me, how does it start again? Say "hi, daddy"? Say it! Hi, daddy! - You know, it feels like something's missing. You need something in your mouth. I want you to look in the camera and I want you to tell us that you're full of shit. - And tell us how worthless you are. Yes, you are. You're up, Mark. Time to shine. What are you... What the fuck? Put it in his mouth. What? What? No fucking way! Yeah, no fucking way! - Put it in his mouth or it's a fucking gun. If you put that near my mouth, I'll fucking bite it right off. - Mark, if you ever want to see your fucking wife again, you're gonna do it, you understand me? I can't fucking do this. Do it! Fucking can't fucking do this! Fine! You don't want him to put it in your mouth? This is the only reason you're still alive. Pull his pants down. He can't bite you with this. Don't do. Don't do it! Do it! No! No! If you ever want to see your fucking kid again, do it! No... Do it! Shut up! Shut up! Do you want to see your baby? Do it! Do it! Shut up! Do it! Don't move! On the ground! She was holding us hostage! Don't talk, don't move. Hey, hey! Behind the van, arms up! Let's go! I'm not armed. I don't have a weapon, okay? On the ground! On the ground! All right. Now tell me what the hell is going on here. - She fucking took us hostage, man. That's what the hell's going on here. Can you get us out of here? Are you by yourself? Yeah. Does that van work? I don't know. Yeah? She one of them? I don't know. I don't fucking know, man. Let's just get the fuck out of here right now. Hey, hey, we don't get your boyfriend to the hospital, he's dead, all right? Take this. Keep your eye on this one. I shot her in the shoulder. She's in shock. She's still breathing. Jesus. - Do you have a cell phone or a radio or something? We need to call like backup. Tell me you have a fucking radio, man. Please, please tell me you have a phone. Oh my god. Susan. Come on, come on, give me a signal, come on! Hello? Hello! Mark? Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Mark? What? - Come on, I've got a fucking bar. Hello! - I can barely hear you, where are you? What? Hello? Mark! Mark, you're breaking up. Oh, shit. Fuck. Stay with the van! You got me pretty good. You shoulda moved on. I think I'm bleeding out. Well you were helping the wrong people. I made a choice. You can't go through life pretending you don't see what's right in front of your eyes. It's no way to live. It's no way to die either. - Living, knowing I never even tried would have been worse. Those are bad men. And they're getting what they deserve. No. Nobody deserves that. That's exactly my point. I was only trying to help. Fuck! My name is Mark Tallion, okay? I've been taken hostage. Can you hear me? Hello! I don't know. I'm in the woods somewhere. I think I'm east of the city. People have been hurt. Landmarks? We need, we need help! We need backup! I don't fucking know. Just. No, I'm in the middle of nowhere. She killed two hikers. Another guy came out of the woods. Get someone out here! Hello? Hold on. Hello? Fuck. Hello? Come on! Come here, bitch! Yeah, you skanks are all the same. Stupid and weak. Yeah. Tell me how it feels. The fuck? You like that? You wanna rough me up? Hurt me? Fuck me? What the fuck was that? He attacked me. He was trying to kill me. So you decided to fuck him? Beth, calm down. I had no choice! Are you playing me? I thought you understood what we were doing out here. I do understand. - Well it sure as fuck doesn't look like it! You weren't here, Beth. He was on top of me. What was I supposed to do? I don't know? Maybe keep your pants on! I needed you. You weren't here. I can't do this all by myself. I had to go after him. Where's Mark? He's gone. What do you mean. I lost him. He's a journalist! Yeah, well I don't know where he went, Sam. Maybe if you had been helping me, instead of fucking that sleezebag in the van, then we would be on track still! - You brought us out into buttfuck nowhere. It's not my fault Grizzly Adams happened to be out here hunting deer and saving people! Your plan has gone to shit. We need to get out of here. We're almost done. You fucking bitch. I really thought she was gonna kill you. I need some water. Where you going, hot shot? It's over. Let's get out of here. Not that easy. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. You know how hard it was to find someone like her? Damaged, vulnerable, yet strong, angry? You found her? Bingo. Hey. It's me. It's almost done. See you soon. I've met you before, you know. That's why you recognized me. It was back in college. Kappa Sigma Phi party. Bunch of people were about to graduate. I was barely out of high school. I remember, I was having such a good time. I was there with my girlfriends, and Jonathan talking to me all evening. I thought he was cute. I probably would have slept with him. I remember thinking that. You told him to give me a drink. I remember that. I remember John giving me a drink, and that's it. Nothing else. The next thing I remember is waking up sore all over. Everything hurt. I was in a room I didn't know. I went home that day sick and I cried. I didn't know why, but I cried all day. I just felt like something was wrong. I had no idea. Make it hurt. - Three days later is when I first heard about the tape. It was going around campus, spreading like wildfire, and you guys had already moved on to the next girl, and the next and the next, and the next... I moved on with my life, much as I could. Went to a lot of therapy, blamed myself a lot. I drank too much. I let it happen. Then I heard you guys had started a company, and there you were, just going on with your life. That drove me mad. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I couldn't sleep, knowing you were out there, abusing women, getting paid, laughing about it to your buddies. That's when I met Beth. Did you know it's more likely for a woman in the military to be sexually assaulted than killed in combat? Yeah. Anyway, she understood how I felt. She wanted to make it right for me, for her, and you were such an easy target. God! You had your head so far up your own ass, putting yourself out in the open every day making your sick little X-Bus videos, and well, here we are. I know, I know. You're sick of hearing me talk. You're tired. You just want this all to be over now, but I put a lot of thought into this, Steve. Especially this next part. Thought for hours about what is the most important thing to a man. To you, your most prized possession. Watching you confess, suffer, and beg was the most satisfying moment of my life. You what? Make it hurt. Press it. Help me! At this time we're not allowed past the entrance that leads down this unpaved road. What we do know is that it all started with a shocking video posted online from an anonymous account. The video depicts what some are calling the most gruesome and violent vigilante act in online history. The police have told us that three people are dead, another three are seriously injured, and two remain missing. The individuals we have identified from the video are Mark Tallion, a journalist, Steve Coulter of X- Bus Industries, a porn site that features sexual acts happening in a van, and his business partner, John Wilkinson. Wilkinson and Coulter were in the news some time ago, facing rape charges. Those charges have been dropped, and the accused acquitted. Police... Police are now releasing new information. We are learning that the three men were last seen leaving downtown Seattle together in a white van. A source close to Tallion reports the men were planning to film a pornographic video. Was today a typical day on the X-Bus gone wrong, or a well-hatched plan of abduction and revenge? I'm Joanna Wills for KCXY Seattle.
