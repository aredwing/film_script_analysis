The snow-covered peaks, the rolling valleys, the beautiful rivers... For the first time in my life, I felt like I was home. Then Dad dropped the bomb... We were moving again, all the way to Florida. # I'm wondering where the lions are # # Wondering where the lions are # # I'm wondering where the lions are # # Wondering where the lions are # # I'm wondering where the lions are # # Wondering where the lions are # # Mmm # # Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay # # One of these days we're going to sail away # # Going to sail into eternity # # Some kind of ecstasy has got a hold on me # # And I'm wondering where the lions are # # Wondering where the lions are # # I'm wondering where the lions are # # Wondering where the lions are # # I'm wondering where the lions are # # Wondering where the lions are # # Mmm # Mom said it was so sunny and gorgeous... that everybody in America wanted to live there. Everybody except me. And as usual, I was out-voted. My parents gave me the same old pitch about being the new kid in school. Mom said I'd make lots of new friends. They promised I would love it there. Whoa. Get him, dude! Aah! Had enough, huh, cowgirl? Hmm? Had enough? Yeah. Aah! I can't hear you, Tex. Unh! Unh! Unh! Aah! Had enough... Tex? Yeah. OK? I've had enough. Aah! Allow me to be the first to welcome you to Coconut Cove. Awesome. Yeah. Who's the bad man now? Who? Who? One-Baker-six responding. We're getting a Mother Paula's here. How about that? About time you showed up. Oh, yeah, sorry. I was dealing with a 443 over on Twelfth Street... that eventually turned into a 961. Took me a little while to button it up. Uh-huh. Don't you, uh, want to know what a 443 is? No, I do not. I want you to deal with what we got going on over here. OK. They yanked up all my survey stakes. Filled them in, every last one of them. They must've snuck in late last night or early this morning. OK, can you at least give me a monetary estimate on the damage done? What are you talkin' about? Sir, in order for it to be vandalism... there has to be some kind of monetary damage. Like, something has to be broken or defaced. Otherwise, l... I don't know what to tell you about your stakes. It ain't about the darn stakes! It's screwin' up our entire construction schedule. I've got to resurvey the whole site before we can start clearin' and gradin'. Sir, I copy that... and I'm gonna keep my eyes and my ears open... and I'm gonna talk to my people on the streets... and try and get it figured out. Whatever. Well, sir, like I said, I'm gonna do the best I can, OK? Fine. Ow. What's the deal with these holes? They're holes, all right? Now come on. I ain't got all day. Every new school is different... but somehow they always seem the same. And day one was never my favorite. Good job, Nancy. Excellent, Zack. All right. And that was a great job with Chapter 5... which logically leads us to Chapter 6... Tectonic Plates and the Ocean Floor. I hope we all have our books. We can open them to Chapter 6. Yes? You must be Mr. Eberhardt from... let me guess. Montana. - Ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha! Welcome to Marine Studies. I'm Mr. Ryan. Have a seat. Thanks. Where was I? Chapter 6... Ocean Topography. - Howdy, partner. - He looks like Woody from Toy Story. Hey... l... I saw what happened on the bus this morning. Don't take it personally or anything. Dana screws with all the new kids. Just play dead for the next couple days, and eventually he'll forget you're alive. - I'm Garrett. - Roy. Six schools in the last eight years? What are you? In the witness protection program or something? Funny, nah. My... My dad's work makes us move around a lot. Hey, are there any other schools around here? Why? You sick of this one already? No, no. Just, I saw this weird kid on the way to school today... and I don't see him around here... so I figured he must not go to Trace. He... He was running like crazy with no shoes on. Fast. Faster than any kid I've ever seen before. You've already got a psycho bully on your hands. You know, m-maybe you want to slow down on the nut-job collecting. Plus, you know, it's only day one. # All the cool kids in the back of the bus # # Rubba dubba scrubba bubba # # What you talkin' 'bout, Gus? # # Breakin' the rules, I hope we don't get caught # # Sha la la la la la la la la # Sweet threads. Thanks. Oh, yeah. Oh, n-n-noogie! Hey, man. Looks like today might be your lucky day. Oh, where you going, cowgirl? No, Dana, let go. I gotta go. Oh, hold up here, cowgirl. You're my little puppet. Dance, little tomato. - Dance. - Aah! Unh! Aah! Hah... No way. Excuse me. Gotta go. Out of the way. - Unh! - Watch it! He broke my nose! It hurts! Hey, slow down! # Everybody get on your feet # # You make me nervous when you're in your seat # # Take of your shoes and pat your feet # # Doin' a dance that can't be beat # # Barefootin' # Wait up! # We're barefootin' # Where are you going? # Barefootin' # # Yeah, we're barefootin' # - Hey, there's a kid. - Fore! - Fore! - Fore! - Fore! - Fore! Oh, you hit him. What club'd you use? Eight iron. You all right? Honey, it's only your second day. This isn't like you. Why'd you punch this kid? He was choking me to death, and I was just trying to get free. Well, you broke his nose. Well, they're not gonna let you ride the bus for three days. I'll ride my bike. That's not the point. I discussed this with your principal... and we decided you're going to write this kid a letter of apology. You gotta be kidding me. Who's gonna help him read it? Heh, heh... You nearly knocked me over yesterday. Why were you running? Look, I think it's because I just broke the nose... of the meanest kid in school. Oh, I heard all about it, cowgirl, but that's not why you ran off, was it? - Just... let go. - Tell the truth. Ow. You were chasing somebody, weren't you? You saw him, too? The kid with no shoes? Oh, I didn't see anything. And if you know what's good for you, neither did you. Got it? Mornin'. How you doin'? Now this time, I got some actual vandalism to report. All right. This time they messed with private property. There you go. Each one of them tires is worth 150 bucks. They slashed my sidewalls. Yeah, uh... I don't think these tires were slashed. I think they were just, uh... - De-inflated. - De-inflated? Yeah, I'll write up a report on it. Write a report? - Yes, sir. - Why don't y'all... just put on some extra patrols out here. Now look... l... I'll talk to my captain. Did they mess with anything else? There ain't nothin' else out here to mess with. You, uh, you check out these toilets yet? Well, sure, but they ain't near as comfortable... as the ones we got in the trailer. Yeah, l... I meant for vandalism. You wanna go pokin' your head in the potty, be my guest. What are you doin' up there? Listenin'. Listenin' to what? Just step away from the potty, please, sir. Step away. Aah! Ohh! Oof! Unh... Oh, come on now, it don't smell that bad. Ehh..."Dear Dana... "I promise not to hit you ever again as long as you don't bother me on the school bus. "I think that's a fair arrangement. "Most sincerely, Roy A. Eberhardt." So what'd you guys think? Sincere enough? Honey, if he's such a big bully, isn't the note a little forceful? The kid was choking me, Mom... I'm not gonna write him a love letter. Look, this is what happens when you're the new kid. Come on, Roy, I'm the new kid at work. You don't see me getting into fist fights at the office. No offense, Dad... but you don't have to ride the school bus to work. Just... Just let me know when we're moving again. # Florida, I know ya # # I'll be hidin' from me... # There were a total of six gators, sir. The largest being four feet even... the smallest being, uh... 24 inches. Eh, probably just a bunch of kids screwin' around. Well, that was my original assumption... but with all due respect, Captain, I mean... h-how many kids do you know that could handle a four-foot alligator? I think we're dealing with, uh, you know... with a maybe more sophisticated syndicate... you know, somebody that really has it in for, uh, Mother Paula's... you know, possibly a... a revenge type deal. - Revenge? - Yes. Like, you know, a... a rival pancake house. That's a great piece of police work, Officer Delinko. And then also l... Hey, look, Sherlock... there are no other pancake houses in Coconut Cove. I got the mayor calling me about... "Coconut Cove's economy needs Mother Paula's." So, go rub those two little brain cells of yours together... then get out there and catch the punks... that are messin' with that construction site. No need to worry, sir, I am on the case. I'm all over it. That's precisely what I'm worried about. Nobody in the history of Trace Middle School... has ever hit a Matherson before. - You're a legend already. - Look... Look, I'm glad I can make my mark on history. OK, look... Iook, I wrote him a note and that should be the end of it. A note? That's adorable. What'd you say? "Sorry I smoked you... "please don't break every bone in my body. "Please leave me one good arm so I can feed myself." You're hysterical. We've got a game to win. Let's be a team for once. What do you know about that girl over there? That's Beatrice the Bear. Please don't tell me you messed with her, too. What is it with you, man? I mean, seriously? She jumped all over me for some reason, I'm just tryin' to figure out why. What's her story? She's a major soccer jock with attitude. First Dana Matherson, now Beatrice the Bear... You must have a serious death wish, bro. Officer David Delinko, case number 0-niner-0... Codename... Flapjack. The time is now... Still no sound. Still no visuals. Just me and the night. A Ione wolf... stalking his prey. Ho! OK... Whew. OK, everything's under control. Everything's OK. So as to adapt my vision to the nighttime visibility conditions... uh, I will now close my eyes for a few brief seconds. One-Baker-six, what's your twenty? I repeat, what's your twenty? This is one-Baker-six, my twenty is, uh, East Oriole and, uh... Uhh... police officer! Police officer! Oh, yeah? You could've fooled me. Ain't you heard me knockin'? What time is it? About 8:30. You gonna want to see this. This one about beats the band. Oh, no... Oh, no... Oh! No! Oh, yes, yes, yes! No, my cruiser! Your cruiser? Forget about your car. They yanked up all my darn stakes again. - Uhh... - Hey! Buddy... My stakes! I knew I couldn't spend the rest of the year hiding from Beatrice the Bear... so even if it meant getting decapitated with my lunch tray, I had to take a stand. What is your problem? I think you're the one with the problem. - Uh? - Ohh... Beatrice, I have no idea why you're mad about what happened on the bus... because you're not the one who got choked... and you're not the one who got punched in the nose. So, if I did something to upset you, then I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose. So next time you have a problem, just tell me... and we can sit down and talk about it... like civilized human beings, OK? Civilized? Are we straight on this? Good, then I'm glad we had this chance... to get to know each other just a little bit better. He's kinda cute, don't you think? - Ha ha. - Ha. In a way that's not cute at all. Sure you don't want me to come with you? Just keep the engine running. Hi, is Dana home? Who are you? I go to school with him. Dana! Dana! What? Get over here. I am not believing this. Hi, I just came by to give you something. It's... it's a letter. Um, so, who are you again? I'm Roy, the one your son tried to strangle to death the other day. The one who slugged him in the nose. You gotta be kiddin' me. This little twerp's the one who messed up your beautiful face? Yeah, Mommy. Look, l... I came by to apologize, ma'am. It's all in the letter. Let me see that. Me and you will settle up when I get back to school. Uh, actually, this letter is supposed to settle us. Me and you are a long way from settled. Now get lost, cowgirl. Dana... Give me that! No, not... gimme! I need to read what that says! What if it's a death threat! Come on! God! They're both rather odd, aren't they? Yes, they are. Maybe I should go and introduce myself. You're not funny. Start the car. Will you please just give me... - I want the letter. - Stop it! After getting whacked by that ball... I wasn't really thrilled about going back to the golf course. But that was the last place I'd seen the barefoot kid... and I wanted to find out what he was up to. Hello? Anybody here? Aah! This is not good. I wouldn't move, if I were you. I wasn't planning on it, not with cottonmouths. I want you to step backwards real slowly. On three... - One... - I don't think so. - Two... - No way! Three. Three! Uh! Ahh! Uh! Hey! What are you doing? Uh! Who are you and why are you here? Name's Roy. Look, I saw you run by the school bus the other day. I didn't come out here to hassle you. I just want to talk. You're gonna have to get out of here like right now. Ahh! - Now let's go. - Ahh! All right. All right. Why do you have poisonous snakes in a bag? That's my business, so just leave me alone. Where are you taking me? Keep walking and don't turn around till you count to fifty. You come 'round here again, you're gonna wake up one mornin'... with one of them big old cottonmouths in your bed, all right? Now start counting. Ahh, one, two... three, four... five... six... seven... Eight... nine, ten... ahh, forget it. Fore! Fore, kid! Uh! That hurt. Hey, Mom. Hmm? Is it illegal for a kid my age not to go to school? Well, I don't know if it's an actual law, but... Oh, yes, it is. Truancy's what it's called. I bet I know what this is really about... and I told you that that letter was too assertive. Oh, the letter was just fine. Listen to this... "A Coconut Cove police cruiser... "was vandalized early Monday morning while parked at a construction site... "when an unknown prankster spray-painted the car's windows black... "while the officer slept inside. "There have been three incidents within in a week at this location... "the future home of Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House." Oh, we're getting a Mother Paula's here. That'll be nice. Hey, Dad, can I see the newspaper for a second? Mm-hmm. Thank you. You'll notice that your name wasn't mentioned. That's because we refused to release it to the media. Thank you. I'm really sorry about this, sir... and... and l... l... I assure you that it will not happen again. - Oh, you bet it won't... - No. Because if it does, your name will be in the paper... under the headline "Officer Terminated"! Do you copy? I copy, Captain. Ah, so now, wh... what about my cruiser? Ahh, oh, I think I've got the perfect set... of replacement wheels for you. Ha ha ha. That looks like a small key. She's all yours. Don't forget to plug her in. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ahh! Sir, ha ha ha. Sweet ride, Delinko. Heh heh heh. Ah, ha ha ha. After reading in the paper about the gators and all the other stuff... I couldn't help but wonder if the barefoot kid... was involved with what was going on. So I thought I'd check out the lot for myself. Hey, little guys. What are you doin' here? What do you and your punk friends got planned for tonight? What? Nothing. That's right! You better run! Run, you little bugger! Don't you ever come back! Here's the stuff you wanted. I also made my special banana-mango loaf. Special? Tuh! I don't think I'd feed that to a gator. Kidding. You know I love your cooking. You know, you... you can't stay out here alone forever. Was there anybody looking for me? No, not yet. But I can only cover for you for so long before you're gonna get caught. I know. And I've been tryin' to stay out of sight... but I've only got a few days left to stop them. Hello! Hello! That's that kid that's been following me around. Don't worry. I'll keep him out of your hair. We are not done discussing this. Right. Hello! Hello! Look, I'm not here to hassle you. My bike! Looking for this? That's my bike. Yeah, it is. Now hop on. What? The handle bars, get on the handle bars, you dork. We're going for a ride. # From the beginning... # Ow! # I was wishing that our first impressions # # Wouldn't last # # But then you came to me... # Ow! # With something that was nothing # # And you kept coming back, boy... # - What's in your backpack? - What? Nothing. Oh! Can I get off now? Sure, when you tell me what's in the box. Nothing. Come on, cowgirl. Give it up. - What's in the box? - Shoes. Yeah, sure. I swear! Why are carrying around an old pair of sneakers? That is weird, cowgirl, really weird. They're not for me, they're for this barefoot kid I met. Maybe he doesn't want shoes. Did you ever think about that? Why do you care so much about this kid anyway? I don't know, OK? He looked like he needed help. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll make sure that the barefoot kid gets these sneakers. Now get out of here. So you do know him. Well, who is he? You won't leave it alone. Can I trust you? Of course. He's my brother. Well, my stepbrother. Why doesn't he live with you? My stepmom shipped him off to some military school. He lasted two days and then ran off. He hitchhiked back all the way from Mobile, Alabama. Nobody else knows that he's here and nobody's gonna tell them, right? Not me. About four years ago... when my dad was still playing pro basketball... he went to this celebrity golf tournament... where he met some cheerleader named Lana. At the wedding, she shows up with a son that she didn't seem to like at all. She didn't even like her own son? I'm the only one he even talks to anymore. What's his name? I call him Mullet Fingers. Mullet Fingers? Why? I think you've heard enough for one day. Besides, it's getting late. Yeah... Looks like I'm gonna be late for dinner. Here's your excuse. Look like you could use a lift. Why don't you throw your bike in the back and hop on in. - Thank you, sir. - You got it. Yep, there you go. Won't you go ahead and buckle up for me. One-Baker-six, one-Baker-six, come in. Sorry, I just got a little police business... I got to tend to. - Whoo-hoo! Go for one-Baker-six. Did you pick up the captain's dry cleaning yet? Yeah, this is, uh, just kind of a temporary arrangement. What's your name, son? I'm Roy, Roy Eberhardt. Can I ask you something, Roy? Now you go to Trace, right? You every hear any chatter about stuff that's been happening... at the new pancake house that's going up? No, but I saw the newspaper about the police car getting painted. Well, police officers aren't superheroes, Roy... and a stakeout can be a real test of focus for any good lawman. Even for a cop as good as that cop was. Ahh, you see how I'm looking at you right now... Like this? You see these eyes? Police work requires focus, Roy. Uh! - Watch it! - Uh, ahh! And... extreme tiger-like reflexes, like the ones I just exhibited. Whew. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Don't they smell delicious? You bet they do. Pancakes don't just feed the stomach... Take seven. Don't they smell... Of course, they do. - I'm sorry. - And action. They feed the soul. Ah-choo! - Marker. - No, you look great. - You look great. - OK. OK, it's sliding. And... freeze. Not good. I thought it was OK. We'll have to re-shoot this whole thing before we hit the road. I don't want to go to Wherever, Florida. These opening are getting old, Chuck. Really? Getting paid to dress up as Mother Paula... and do almost nothing, that's getting old? I didn't say that. You keep this up, you'll be back... dancing on a cruise ship where I found you. Well, good luck finding somebody else who'll put up with this stupid job, Mister. Ahem, Mr. Muckle. I have Coconut Cove on line five. Thank you, Felix. Which means you should go get packed, 'cause you're going to Florida. Mr. Brannit, what does one hundred pancake houses... sound like to you? Sounds like an awful lot of pancake houses, Mr. Muckle. It's a record-breaking accomplishment. I will be the first regional manager in the history of Mother Paula's... to reach one hundred pancake houses. And that is the stuff... that food and beverage industry legends are made of. Ahh, it is my dream. And you, Mr. Brannit, are responsible... for making a tiny piece of that very big dream come true. Gotcha. So then why are we behind schedule, over budget... and on the front page of the crime report? Well, we got us a... a tiny bit of a trespassing problem, sir. Well, solve the problem... or I will replace you with someone who can. What about them owls? What owls? Well, you know, the ones we got in the little... holes and... This time, at half speed, Brannit, ignore owls or lose job. I want you to go out and get what it takes... to keep those vandals off my lot. Attack dogs, Rottweilers, Dobermans... I don't care, just get that site cleared. Yes, sir. You sure them dogs will do the trick? Oh, please. It's best you get as far away as possible. All right. All right. Just look a little tame to me. I ain't paying top dollar... just for them to sit around slobbering, eating tenderloins. Sic him. All right. All right. Call them off. All right, call them off. - Off! - Call them off! - Off! Off! - Hey! Hey! Hey, all right! All right! All right! Here, you can go now. Not to worry... the dogs will take care of all of your problems by the morning. Yeah. Come, boys, come. Come, babies. Whoa! Easy. Ahh, no, no. Hi, Dana. Hey, cowgirl. You and me got some business to settle, Eberhardt. What business? I gave you an apology. That makes us even. We're a long way from even, you and me. You're gonna be sorry you ever messed with me. I am going to be your worst nightmare. Aah! - Uh! - Unh! What are you staring at? Hey, Beatrice. Unh! Please, don't hurt me. Ta-aah! Aah! What happened? Spooked, they got spooked. That's what happened. Spooked? How'd they get spooked? They're supposed to be doing the spookin'. There's only one thing that spooks a dog like this... snakes. We ain't got no snakes 'round here. Oh, you've got 'em. You got 'em crawling all over the lot. What? Do you know what happens when dog gets bit by snake? - What happens? - Dog dies. But we ain't got no snakes. Oh? What is that? Yeah, a snake. Yeah. What you think now? Do you think Kahler is some kind of crazy boy, huh? We go home, boys. # Ah-ooo # # Werewolves of London # # Ah-ooo... # Eberhardt, you look sick. You should go home early. I feel fine. I don't care how you think you feel... you should call your mom and go home, bro. Why? Look, I know a guy in Dana's P.E. class. He says Dana's gonna snatch you right before you get on the bus. And do what? Ahh, guess you got till 2:45 to find out. In the meantime, I'll get to work on your eulogy. Eulogy? So to answer your question... Pacific swells are usually a lot bigger than Atlantic swells. But remember, Kelly Slater is from Florida. OK, test tomorrow. - Wait, wait, wait. - Be ready. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - See ya. - Bye-bye. - OK, bye. - Bye. Be ready. - Bye, Mr. Ryan. - Bye. Roy, you OK? Oh, yeah, yeah, everything's fine. All right, maana. Hey, Mr. Ryan, wait up. You going home, too? Sooner or later. I got some papers to grade, but hopefully I'll catch a few waves before dinner. Cool, I think, uh, I think I'm just gonna walk with you for a little bit. Isn't the bus the other way? Ahh, just stretching my legs. Roy, is there something you want to talk to me about? Oh, no, no, everything's fine. Well, then you better get going or you'll miss your bus. Later, dude. Ahh, get over here. Aah! Curly Brannit. - Brannit, what's going on? - Hello, sir. Did you get my message 'bout the dogs? You're telling me snakes scared off the dogs? Well, now, sir, theses wasn't just your ordinary snakes... these was cottonmouths. And a cottonmouth'll kill a dog pretty darn quick. Really? Can they kill a bulldozer? Probably not. Brannit, I am this close to firing up the chopper... and coming down there myself. And trust me, you do not want that. No, sir. I told you, it was settled. Ow! Not even close. Aah, ha ha ha! Help! Help! Come on, cowgirl. Aah! Aah, shh... ow! Leave me al... ow! Aah! Aah! Aah, uh. Uh! Ha ha ha. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, I jus... Um, Mr. Ryan? How in the heck did that... Hey! You did that? You can thank me later, but right now we gotta go. Hop on, I need your help. Ha ha ha. Aah! Grr. Did you get everything I wanted? Yep, my mom keeps a trauma unit under the sink. OK, come on. We gotta go. I came by at lunch, and I found him like this. Uh, uh. The dog got me. Sss... Sss... uhh. Let me see. I'm going to put some antibiotic cream on for now. But you're gonna need a doctor. Uh, I'll be OK, all right? Sss... Uhh. How'd you get bit? My arm got stuck. Sss... - Doing what? - Uhh. Sss. Uhh. I got some little friends I look after over at this construction site. Anyway, they brought in these big dogs to get rid of me. So, I put some snakes around the lot to freak the dogs out. See, I knew the trainer would drag 'em out of there... when he saw that they were cottonmouths. Sss. Ow. Does this have anything to do with that cop car... that got painted black? The gators in the toilet? If they build that pancake place, those baby owls are toast. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen those owls. Wait, you have? Why don't they just build somewhere else? We tried to tell them about the nest... But all we got back was this form letter from this jerk named Muckle... saying they had all the permits they needed to build. They don't care about little birds. My brother's been trying to stall them ever since. Uhh... Hey, hey. You OK? Ha... are you kidding? Uhh... I feel like a million bucks. Uhh... Hey! H... unh! Uhh! Uhh! Let's get him to a hospital. The Central Florida shrimping industry has suffered major... Are you a big boy with a big appetite? You betcha, I am. Then come on down to Mother Paula's... for our famous all-you-can-eat pancake buffet. # Mother Paula's, we cover the world # Huh? # One flapjack at a... # What are you up to now? Uh... Uh... Uh! Aah! This is bad, cowgirl. Really bad. Don't worry. He's gonna be fine. I'm worried about him. I've never seen him act like this. Which one of you is Roy Eberhardt? - He is. - He is. - Police officer? - Hi, there! What's this about? Must be Roy's parents. I'm Officer Delinko, C.C.P.D. - OK. - Hi. Anyhoo, I, uh, I met Roy the other day... he got a flat. I gave him a ride home. So, when I heard over the radio that he was in the hospital... and they couldn't reach his parents by the phone... I figured I'd just come by and see if I could find y'all. - In the hospital? - Oh, my God. - Is he OK? - Oh, yeah. Sorry. No, he's... he, uh, he got bit by a dog. He's gonna be fine. That's the word. So, uh, you a police officer, Mr. Eberhardt? I'm with the Department of Justice. Where's Roy at? Oh, right. Sorry. He's um... he's over in the hospital on Eighth Street. Honey! So, wow. Department of Justice. We oughta get together and swap stories sometime. I'd, uh, take you over there myself, but I'm in this... this, uh, smallish vehicle, and you'II... probably get there before me. Let's go. Anyways. I'm in... this thing. This... this... Tell me again what happened, from the beginning. All right. A dog the size of a Buick attacked Roy at soccer practice. He came home all chewed up... so we brought him here as fast as we could. It's true! N-no, I believe your brother was attacked by a dog... I just don't believe that it happened today. Judging by how far the infection has progressed... I'd estimate he was bitten... eighteen to twenty-four hours ago? Yeah. Eighteen hours, that sounds about right. Because he, um... he, uh, right, he passed out right after he got bit. It wasn't until the next day that Beatrice called me and asked me... if I'd help get him to a hospital. I see. And... where are your parents? - Their parents... - Well... Their parents, they, uh, they work on a crab boat. And you are? Uh... - Ling Ho. - Uh. OK. Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to go attend to Roy. And then the three of us are gonna sit down... and somebody's gonna start telling me the truth. OK? Ling Ho? Ling Ho? You couldn't come up with anything better than Ling Ho? Uh... This is not gonna work, cowgirl. Once they figure out that Mullet's not you... they're gonna put him in juvey... or Lana's gonna ship him off somewhere... where he can't run away. Don't worry. We'll come up with something. I bet you will, cowgirl. But I gotta go. But wait... wait. Where are you going? To fix dinner for my dad. I do it every night. I'll be back in an hour. I promise. You're kidding, right? Hey! Come on! Get that tin can outta the road! We tried to get a hold of you, but his friend said you were out at sea. That you work on a crab boat. What? Anyway, he was bitten by a dog, so we've got him on an antibiotic drip. With a little rest, he should be just fine. Where's Roy? I just... I mean, I really... Ahh. I don't know. You don't know? One minute there's an injured boy in this bed... the next minute, he just vanished? And how can you lose the one and only patient that you have? Mom! Dad! I'm right here. Oh, honey! Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Roy, get back in the bed. Let's get a look at those dog bites. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Everybody, hold on a minute. This is not Roy. No, of course it is. Guys, I didn't get bit. It wasn't me. Ahh. Excuse me, folks, but we still have a patient missing. Can someone please explain to me what's going on here? I think only one person can do that. Roy. Who was in that bed, and where did he go? And I wanna know now. I don't know his real name, and I don't know where he went. I'm sorry. But that's the truth. Let me explain. All he was trying to do was save the owls. If the Mother Paula's people bulldoze that lot... they'll bury all the dens. Owls'll be gone. Roy, it's their property. But it doesn't mean that it's right, Dad. Those owls can't fight for themselves. Somebody's gotta stick up for them. That's all he was trying to do. Ahh. You're just getting settled here, Roy. Why you wanna get mixed up in all this? I wasn't looking for it. It just happened. What just happened? Some pirate kid hassling a construction site? I didn't do anything to that construction site. I'm not finished. Roy, you broke a kid's nose. You got... you got, uh, suspended from the school bus. Today a police officer shows up at our house. What's going on with you? You've always had such good judgment. Where is it? Where is it? Room service. - Here. - Oh. Thanks. Um, how's your arm? Eh, fever's gone, but I ache all over. Get in trouble last night? No big deal. But I had to tell my dad... about the owls and Mother Paula's. What'd he say? He said they can build whatever they want... as long as they have legal papers. There's really nothing we can do. We? You know what I mean. You're saying it's a lost cause, right? Hey, come on, Tex. You gotta start thinking like an outlaw. I'm not an outlaw. Yeah, you are. Last night at the hospital. That was definitely an outlaw move. You were hurt. You crossed the line, 'cause you cared about what happened to me. Hey. Come on. I got something really cool to show you. Ever since I was little, I've been watching this place disappear. The piney woods, the mangroves, the creeks, the glades. Even the beaches. And they put up these giant hotels and only goober tourists are allowed. It really sucks. The same thing's happening everywhere. Wait, they got mountains where you're from, right? Yeah. Miles and miles of 'em. See, that's what we need here. I mean, this state's so flat, there's nothing to stop 'em... from bulldozing from one coast to another. Except for you. Yeah. Except for me. Cool. Watch this. Whoo-hoo! Take a peek. What is it? It's a mullet. See, that's why my sister calls me Mullet Fingers. Ain't too many people who can do that, you know? Bye, little guy. Swim fast. # I come from where the rivers meet the sea # # That's why I think I'm so wild and fancy free # # I was early into crazy ways # # My folks said, it's just a phase # # They were hoping for better days # # Now in my line of work # # I seem to see a lot more than most # # I write 'em down and I pass 'em around # # It's the gospel from the coast # # Reflections, not just replays # # Takin' time to escape the maze # What is that? # Lookin' for better days # # Looking to the left # # Looking to the right # # Looking to the stars to shed some light # # Hoping for a breath # # Hoping for break # # Hopin' for the give without the take # Now... You gotta bite this. - Bite it. - I got it. Oh! Look at all that! # Pale invaders and tanned crusaders # It's huge. # Are worshipping the sun # # On the corner of Walk and Don't Walk # # Somewhere down U.S. One # # Back to livin' Floridays # # Blue skies and ultraviolet rays # # Lookin' for better days # # I'm back to livin' Floridays # # Blue skies and ultraviolet rays # # We're lookin' for better days # Seeing all the wildlife with Mullet Fingers... made me want to swing by and try to get another look at the owls. Change of plan, boys. Oh, yeah. Well, look who's decided to do a little police work. That should do it. Hey, cowgirl. - Uhh! - Aah! Beatrice the Bear isn't here to save you this time. Uhh! You're gonna be sorry you ever messed with me! Aah! Uhh! Grr. Right behind you, cowgirl. Ow! Uhh! Damn it! Ow! Uh huh huh! Uhh! Aah! Uhh! Ow! Ow! Uhh! Huh! Uhh! Aah! Oh! You say there. Looks like I got me a rat. Big ol' rat in a trap. Don't you move. Yeah, I won't. I won't. We caught it. Caught the Mother Paula's vandal. Caught him red-handed. The what? You're crazy, man. I've never been here before! Stay down. Stay down. I'll take it from here. I'm crazy? I'm crazy? Hey, calm down. Calm down. Get... get your arms up here. What's your name, son? Roy. Roy Eberhardt. Well, Roy, looks like your chubby little reign of terror is over. Hold on a second. I know Roy Eberhardt, and this isn't him. Uh-huh? So I assume you wanna press charges? Well, you bet your cute little scooter, I do. Yeah, attempted burglary, trespassing, destruction of private property... and so forth. Ow. You know, you could make this a lot easier on yourself, son. Yeah, right. Just tell us your real name and quit acting dumb. I ain't acting, and I ain't done nothing wrong, so let me go! OK, have it your way. Oh, come on. # Hey, hey, hey # # Hey, hey, hey, hey # Hi, Captain. Don't just stand there like a seagull. Sit down. Sorry. Thanks. A heck of a collar out there, Delinko. Just got off the phone with the mayor. He says we need more cops on the street like you. Heh heh heh. Sir, I was just doing my job. Right place at the right time. Did... did he really say that? Looks like you reeled in one nasty bullshark. This Matherson kid's got a heck of a rap sheet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about, sir. If you look in his record, it just doesn't make sense. I mean, shoplifting, breaking into candy machines... th-this kid's a delinquent. Not a vandal. It just doesn't add up to me. This is police work, Delinko, not algebra. Kid's been breaking the law since kindergarten... and you caught him red-handed. Case closed. Well, sir, I just... I believe these belong to you. Oh, boy. My cruiser. Just remember. Screw up again, you'll be swattin' skeeters... and counting cushions at the boat ramp. Copy that, sir. Can't say, uh, I'm gonna miss that, uh, smallish vehicle. Yeah. You expect me to do the right thing... and I'm trying my best. Well, we know you are, son. I'll see you in the morning, Roy. Tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck. Toes. Good night, Roy. Night, Mom. Good night. Hey, Dad? Yeah? What do you do to catch the bad guys? At work? Yeah. Well, uh, we don't chase our bad guys down the streets. The key is to catch 'em in their paperwork. Sooner or later, they all slip up, and they leave a trail. Right. I know it's, uh, boring stuff... not the razzle dazzle you were hoping for, right? I don't know. Maybe it is. OK. See ya. Get some sleep. Night, Dad. Tuck, tuck, tuck. Toes. Don't freak out. It's me. Me who? Me, Beatrice. How did you get in here? Easy. Sliding door on the porch popped right off the track. They all do. How long have you been hiding here? Oh, don't worry. I closed my eyes while you put on your very colorful jammies. Are you completely whacko? I'm sorry. It's just... Things got kind of crazy back at home. My dad and Lana, they got in this huge fight... and I mean, huge. She threw a clock radio at his head, so I beaned her with a mango. She went berserk. I didn't know where else to go. I was gonna stay with Mullet, but he wasn't at the boat yard. If you want, you can stay here. Really? Yeah. Just as long as my parents don't check back in... or we'll both be in trouble. You take the bed. I'll sleep on the floor. No way. I'm fine right here. All right. Suit yourself. Hey, cowgirl? Yeah? Ahh. I'm really glad that, um... I'm just gonna call you Roy from now on... if that's all right with you. And what's wrong with Ling Ho? Ha ha ha. Ow. It's not like him to disappear. He must be up to something. Don't worry. We'll find him. - Hey! - Aah! - Ha ha. - Ha ha ha. You jerk. What is that thing? It's a bulldozer seat. What are you doing with it? You can't drive a bulldozer without a seat, Bea. Don't tell me you stole... You're gonna love this. Come on. I'll show you. - Ha ha. - Ha ha ha. What the... Shh. Oh, mercy. Huh? Not the seat! You gotta be kidding me. Let's go. What am I gonna tell Muckle now? You can start by telling me why I shouldn't fire you. Oh! Goodness gracious! Mr. Muckle! We wasn't expecting you until tomorrow. Yes, Mr. Brannit, I came a day early. I'm gonna be sticking a silver shovel into somethin'... at that groundbreaking ceremony tomorrow. I want it to be free of you-know-whats. Gotcha. Oh! Oh, my. We're bulldozing today. Today? Today? This obviously wasn't something... I could count on you to handle unsupervised. Yes, sir, but today is gonna be a little difficult. Speak! Well, we had another incident, sir. And this time, somebody took the seat off the bulldozer. What's the quickest you can get a new seat? Well, I guess I could head over to construction supply in Fort Meyer. Go there, get it right now. I'll keep an eye on things here and make sure nothing else happens. Oh, and, Brannit, on your way back... pick up Miss Nixon at the hotel. I want her in her Mother Paula's costume... for a dress rehearsal at 3:00 sharp. And if you run into anyone... you keep your trap shut about all this, you got it? - Yes, sir. - Good, go. Mr. Muckle, I just want to say that... I've been trying like the dickens down here... Get seat! Get Mother Paula. - Get going. - Yes, sir. - Let's go. - OK, let's go. So, uh, you've had some time to think about your situation? I don't need to think, all right? That's how come I got a lawyer. Hey, did, uh, you spray-paint the windows of my squad car? How 'bout those gators in the toilet? I have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, really? - Yeah, really. - Yeah? Now why don't you be a good cop and go get me some donuts? OK, and that's the end of the nice interrogation. Now it time for a little hardball. Wa... Ha ha ha. That was smooth. You know, you just got to relax, all right? 'Cause you got a long day ahead of ya. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hey, mister, it's that attitude... that got you in here in the first place, OK? Remember that. No, what got me here in the first place is that little twerp Eberhardt, all right? He set me up. I didn't do anything. Huh. Wow, this Roy Eberhardt seem like quite the little evil genius. See you later. Oh, I actually got you something. What, what is it? Well, you know, I figured you'd be going away for about six months... and I thought you might get a little Ionely. So l... I picked you something up. I don't know, you kind of struck me as some what of a nature boy... so I got you this little guy. - There he is. - Oh, my God. Get it out! Get it out! Get it away! Get it away! - Are you sure? - Get it away! OK, Dana, you passed the lie detector test. Crude? Yeah, but effective. Today? I can't believe this. I can't believe this. We've got to do something. Ahh, well, yeah, I'm gonna do something. - Like what? - Well, first... I'm gonna hotwire Muckle's precious Hummer. I'm gonna hook it up to that construction trailer... Wait a minute. That's crazy. And I'll drive 'em to the edge of the canal... put a brick on the gas pedal... and release the emergency brake. You can't do that. It'll sink like a rock, pretty quick. And that'll give me time to come up with somethin'... that'll really freak 'em out. No. No, way. You'll slow them down, but you won't stop them. We've been through this. Plus, you'll end up in jail... and then nobody in town will be in the mood to hear the truth. Ahh. - Ahh. - Ahh. We're the only ones who care. We're the only ones who know. We got to let the town know what Muckle's up to... and stop this construction once and for all. That's what we've been trying to do. These idiots around here won't give a dang. They're all too excited about having a stupid pancake house. Look, I've got an idea. If it doesn't work, you're gonna do what you have to do. But can we at least try it my way first? It's worth a shot. All right. So what's your brilliant plan? So here's what we're gonna do... Burrowing owls. They're legally protected. Hello, this is Monica calling from Mother Paula's... to confirm that the mayor will be here today at 3:30... for the groundbreaking ceremony. Today? I have that scheduled for tomorrow. That's why I'm calling. We had to reschedule due to an unexpected rain tomorrow. Mother Paula can do a lot of things, but she can't change the weather. That would be Mother Nature. Thank you again for calling. And I'll be sure and let everyone know. OK, no problem. Hey, if you want to bring two cameras, l... I mean, that's what WZBY is bringing. But, hey, I'm just the P.R. guy at Mother Paula's. You guys are the journalists. Here you go. Plans, permits, environmental reports. Make it snappy. I got a conch salad going bad in the back. That's weird. Is there another copy of this report? Yeah. The foreman's supposed to have one at the job site. Thanks. Roy? Say, excuse me, where'd that kid go? I don't know, he was just here. What he do, Officer? It's police business. What was he doing in here? He was looking at the files on the new pancake house. What is he up to? Thanks. Where's that nitwit? Thinking about crashing my party? How 'bout a little artic blast to change your mind? Ha ha ha. Yeah, you might want to throw on a sweater. There's a cold front blowing into Florida. Ha! Heh heh heh. Hey, little birdie, you wanna meet my friend? Say hello to Jack Frost. Heh heh heh. I wouldn't do that again if I were you. Who's gonna stop me, you? You asked for it. What are you gonna do? You gonna throw your little butterfly net? Is that what you're gonna do? Oh, no. Please... hey. Hey. OK, you just made a big mistake, nature boy. Ooh! Oof! Ouch. So why are there palm trees in Ireland? Because the tropical waters of the Gulf Stream... traveling north from Florida... Roy, you're late. - Sorry. - Take a seat. Mr. Ryan, I know this is kind of weird... But can I make an announcement real quick? I hope it's important. It's really important. I know you don't know me very well yet... but... I need your help. When I heard this new pancake house was being built... I thought... Cool. l... I mean, who doesn't love pancakes? But then a friend took me out there... and showed me something that changed my mind. What's he doing? What's he talking about? Just... everybody, come to the Mother Paula's lot... right after school. What? I don't know. As I was saying... the... the tropical waters of the Gulf Stream... move north from Florida across the Atlantic... Officer, what can I do for you? Yeah, 'scuse me. I'm, uh, looking for Roy Eberhardt. Oh, Roy. Roy. I think... I think he's over there. Ahem. Roy, I need to ask you a question. Meet in fifteen minutes at the marina. Hey! Hey, hold up! Stop! Freeze! Roy Eberhardt! Come here! Roy! Hey! Roy, come on now. I just wanna talk to you, all right? I just wanna ask you a few questions. That's all, all right? Whoa! Pull your vehicle to the side of the road, son. No, not my cruiser. Come on. That's gonna leave a dent. Oh! Come on, Roy. Please, pull over. I just wanna ask you a few questions. All right, no more Mr. Nice Cop. You got nowhere else to go, Roy! Roy, stop! Hey, Roy, stop! Hey, right there. Just give me a second. I can explain everything... if you just give me one second. l... That was option "A," Roy. OK, but then you fled the scene and you resisted an officer. All right? I know you're involved in this somehow. I got to take you in. I got no other choice. OK? Officer, I'm sorry. I know this might look bad. There's something I got to do. Ohh. Uhh. Roy! Roy! Damn it! How'd it go? You're never going to believe this. Uh, we ran into a little trouble. The police are after me, and we're out of time. If you think that's a little trouble... then you're really gonna get a kick out of this. What are we doing here? Yeah, what's going on? Mmm-mmm-mmm! Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm! Mmm-mmm! Uhh. Mmm-mmm-mm-mm-mm! You can't do this! It just happened. He was trying to kill the owls. What was I supposed to do? We got to get him out of here now before people start... Mmm-mmm-mmm! Showing up. Too late. Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Here you go. - Thank you. Now, where's Muckle? Uh, maybe in the trailer, Mr. Mayor. Hi, Mayor Grandy. Is Mr. Muckle in there? Uh, yeah... um, no. He's been delayed. Um, I'm actually Mr. Muckle's daughter, Mary Myrtle Muckle. He just wanted me to let you know... that everything is proceeding as planned... and he's going to need just a few more minutes. What are you doing? I'm looking for the other copy of the environmental report. Mm-mmm. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm-m-m-m! Three... four... Mmm-mmm. Put your hands together for Mayor Grandy. Welcome, Mayor Grandy! Yeah! Whoo! Bingo! Page five. Yes! There's a cop walking this way. Let's go! Mmm-mmm-mmm. Go! Go! Go! Go! Mmm-mmm-mm-mm-mmm- mmm-mmm-m-mmm-mm-mmm. Good afternoon, Coconut Cove. I love it! Love you, love you. Welcome... Open up. Police. Mother Paula's Pancake House! Welcome! Hello? Mm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mm. Mm. Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. Mmm. Mmm-mmm. What are we going to do? We're going to stick to the plan. You need to let these people know what's going on... Not me. I can't be seen. Only you can do this, Roy. You have to tell them. OK. Good luck, Tex. I thought the ceremony was tomorrow. It is. It was. This is classic Chuck Muckle. He pulls this last minute, flip-flop, flapjack stuff on me all the time. He gives me absolutely no respect. Oh, don't worry. He don't respect me neither. Mmm-mmm. Sir, calm down. Mmm-mmm-mmm. Excuse me? Mmm-mmm-mmm. Mmm! Oh, yeah. Sorry. Aah! What are you trying to say? Untie my hands, you idiot. Wh... what happened? I was abducted! Assaulted! Hog-tied! What is going on here? What happened? You get in some kind of a fishin' accident? The vandals did this. They kidnapped me. What's this? Now, see, I told you they was pesky little fellas. Will you help me get out of this net? We have to get out there! Hold on. Everybody freeze. Something's not right with this environmental report. It says there's evidence of burrowing owls on your property. Uh-oh. Those burrows were abandoned years ago. There are no owls. I'm pretty sure this means your lot needs to be red-tagged... and all construction shut down. I've got a perfectly good explanation for this. But right now, I've got to get out there. It's a great day for Coconut Cove... This ought to be good. Mother Paula's is going to be... a shining example of my six-point economic development plan... bringing to Coconut Cove over twelve new jobs. What's going on? Follow my lead. Excuse me. Who are you? Where is Muckle? He's networking... and he asked me to make an announcement. Um, please, Mr. Mayor, take a seat. It's OK. - All right. - It's OK. Go ahead, Roy. Who likes pancakes? - We do! - Love 'em! Yeah, me, too. I love pancakes. And a pancake house will be great in Coconut Cove. But not here. Not in this spot... because somebody was here first and they still are. They're little baby owls. - Owls? - Owls? No, not up in the trees, but in the burrows you see all around. And if you build a Mother Paula's here... you're gonna kill some really beautiful animals. Now, just think about that as you're chowing down... on your key lime pie pancakes. Oh, no. Hey, Coconut Cove! Welcome to Pancake House number one hundred! Get out of the way, kid! You want to bury those owls, you got to bury me, too! Me, too. That makes three of us. We will not let you kill these owls. Ladies and gentlemen, these kids are a little misguided. They have no proof of any owls. You folks see any owls? 'Cause I don't. - No. - No. There sure is owls. Why would they come out of their holes while everybody's here? All we do is make noise. Cars. Trucks. Bulldozers. All we do is scare them. Yeah. No wonder we don't see them. Maybe if we all just be quiet, they'll come out. Go ahead, Roy. Why don't we try it? Let's all be quiet for one minute. Just sixty seconds, OK? This is absurd. OK? - Yeah. - Sure. Everybody ready? Go. Shh! Shh! Quiet. Quiet. Roy. Look. Ha ha! Check it out. Hey, look. There's one. There's four. - Ha ha. - Ha ha. There's another one. Don't scare him. I can't believe it. Hey, look. There's one over there. Oh, there's another one. Oh, my God. They're so cute. Hey, look! Shh! Shh! Oh, look at that one right there. You were right. Put your hands behind your back, please, sir. You're under arrest for violating state permits... operating a bulldozer without a license... and, uh... a lot of other stuff. Yay! Good job. Good job. Ladies and gentlemen of Coconut Cove. Ladies and gentlemen. Excuse me, Mr. Mayor. Ahem. I would just like to say that I, Mother Paula... am simply shocked by what has gone on here today. And you, young man, are no longer an employee of Mother Paula's. You're fired. Yay! You can't do that. She's crazy. I do the firing. She's only an actress. Boo! And, Mr. Mayor... I would like to donate this land to your town... as an owl sanctuary. Yay! Can she really do that? She just did. And on live TV. Mother Paula, that's a grand idea. Folks, doesn't that sound like a grand idea? Yay! And let me assure you... my office is going to launch a full investigation... into how the presence of these fine little creatures... was overlooked. Yay! Here we go. Guess I owe you an apology, Roy. No problem, Officer. I knew you were all right. Thanks. And thanks for the... you know. It'll come in handy at the trial. No problem. I couldn't have done any of this without Beatrice and Mullet Fingers. Where'd he go? Way to go, son. Mom and Dad realized they liked Florida just as much as I did... and they decided to stay here and make this our home. For good. After all the bad publicity, the pancake company... couldn't back off the promises made that day by Mother Paula. They ended up donating the land as a wildlife preserve. The owls are still there... and you could see them if you're real quiet. Beatrice and I became best of friends and I never missed a soccer game. Attendance was mandatory. Left! Right! Then there's Dana Matherson, who finally met someone... who was bigger and meaner than he was. What is your major malfunction, Chucklebutt? You've got the posture of a jellyfish! Officer Delinko was promoted to his dream job as a detective... and got his first unmarked patrol car. Ahh! Two days later, he accidentally backed it off a fishing pier. While serving his ninety days of community service... Chuck Muckle was hit in the head by a falling coconut. The judge gave him another thirty days for lying down on the job. Curly Brannit quit his job at Mother Paula's. Today, he brags that his life has gone to the dogs. Last, but not least, is Mullet Fingers. Well, whenever he wants to get together... he has his own secret way of letting me know. # Good guys win every once in a while # # Full grown men get to learn from a child # # Now and then just when you think... # And Florida had its own way of keeping us real busy. # But good guys win # # Good guys win every once in a while # # Full grown men get to learn from a child # # Now and then # # Just when you think it won't happen again # # The good guys win # # So you're lookin' for a hero # # That you can see with your own eyes # # When they don't wear the mask and cape # # They're hard to recognize # # Even though these are cynical times # # Bear it in mind # # Good guys win every once in a while # # Full-grown men get to learn from a child # # Now and then # # Just when you think it won't happen again # # The good guys win # # State of confusion, we're so disillusioned # # You turn on the news and the # # Good guys win now and then # # Just when you think it won't happen again # # Good guys win every once in a while # # Full-grown men get to learn from a child # # Now and then # # Just when you think it won't happen again # # The good guys win # # When I wake up in the morning, love # # The sunlight hurts my eyes # # Something without warning moves # # And bears heavy on my mind # # Then I look at you # # And the world's all right with me # # Just one look at you # # And I know it's gonna be # # A lovely day # # Lovely day, lovely day # # Lovely day, lovely day # # Lovely day, lovely day # # Lovely day, lovely day # # And the day that lies ahead of me # # Seems impossible to face # # Someone else instead of me, yeah # # Always seems to know the way # # And then I look at you # # Oh, and the world is all right with me # # Yeah, ah # # Just one look at you # # And I know this is gonna be # # A lovely day # # Lovely day, lovely day # # Lovely day, lovely day # # Lovely day, lovely day # # Lovely day, lovely day # # A lovely day # # Lovely day # # Lovely day, lovely day # # A lovely day, yeah #
