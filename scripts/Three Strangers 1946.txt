Begging your pardon, what were you doing in it? Looking for you. Really? I'm afraid I don't quite understand. Of course. Delighted. It's one flight up. Sir. I'm sorry I can't introduce you. You see, I don't know this gentleman's name, either. Won't you have a chair? It's only whiskey. If you don't mind, I think I'll go. Oh, no, you mustn't really. After getting you all the way up here? I'm sorry, it's rather late. Oh, please don't, please. I ask you as a favor. I played the same trick on the other gentleman. He doesn't seem to mind. Oh, no. On the contrary, I'm having a very good time. You don't know each other? No more than you and I. I got him off the street, too, In much the same manner. We're three strangers, that's the point. Point? What point? Please sit down. You can play. Even the piano must be astonished. Please don't stop. All right, I won't- Unless it interferes with more important things. You're both being very patient with me. The reason that I brought you up here Was to meet Kwan yin. She's a very ancient personage. The goddess of fortune and destiny, Of life and death. She was given to me when my husband and I were in the orient. Very interesting. But what has that to do with us? There's a legend that at midnight on Chinese new year, Kwan Yin will open her eyes and her heart to 3 strangers. This happens to be the night. Yes? Why to three strangers? That's perhaps because in the orient, The 3 is the symbol of the luck principle, Like with us the 7. Indeed? How did you know that? I've managed to collect here and there Some useless bits of information. Open its eyes? How can it? It's made of bronze. You do not believe in miracles, I see. Hardly. Pardon me, sir, But then what do you believe in? Who, me? I believe in what I can see. What I can get my hands on. And I believe that those things are not at all real. Who are we to say that The legend of Kwan Yin Is any less real than the iron You just tapped with your ring? What's the matter? Three on a match? you see? Well, everyone has some silly superstition. Then you can afford to humor mine, Even if that's all it is. Very well. I'll stay and witness your miracle, as you call it. If it's to happen at midnight, we have only 5 minutes to go. That gives us just time to make our wish. Wish? Yes. I mentioned that Kwan Yin would not only open her eyes, But her heart as well. Whatever we ask for she will grant. That's the kind of lady I like. The only difficulty is, it has to be the same wish for all three of us. What could that possibly be? I've been thinking about it for several days. You see, the wish that I have my heart set on Is one that I couldn't possibly expect strangers to share. But I found the solution. What one wish can make all others come true? It's very simple: money. Money? That's all right with me. Although I think that you slightly overestimate its power. No, I have no objections to money. How much do you suppose The Chinese lady can be touched for? A few thousand pounds? That's a very trifling amount, But, uh... I think I can use it. Look. Do you think she would answer a prayer like this? A sweepstake ticket. Anything will do, If we have sufficient faith. Well, now, that would be a proper miracle. You know where I got it? I bought it from a girl in a cafe, Paid my last 10 shillings for it. She had the most extraordinary blue eyes. A strange look... Well, that's unimportant. You know what? I'll take you in as my partners For about 1/3 of my original investment. That's 3 shillings. Huh? This sounds like a very elaborate way Of recouping part of your loss. However, I've gone this far. I'll take a chance. How about you, madam? I'll agree on one condition: We must make a bargain that if the ticket is drawn, No part of it shall be divided. However much it is worth, it must all go on the race. Agreed. I suggest you have good faith toward Kwan Yin, I gather? Yes. Agreed. Now we'll put it in proper form. I like to have everything correct. "We, the undersigned, "Are mutual owners of this ticket. "And we agree to share and share alike in its benefits, If any. " Would you please sign? All right, but we mustn't see each other's signatures Until after midnight. Very well. Now you, if you please. Now mine. You shall be the nominal owner of the ticket. And our pseudonym will be "Kwan Yin. " Very well. Her celestial highness. We now have exactly two minutes and 20 seconds. If it's no secret, What would you do with the money if you win? Well, I'm not sure. I never imagined having that much money. I'm a solicitor. I hope someday to be invited to join the barrister's club, Which denotes a certain standing in my profession. I suppose if I were that rich, There'd be no question about an invitation. What am I dreaming about? The chances of winning a sweepstake ticket Are about a million to one. Oh, you mean mathematically speaking. Yes, of course. And you? What is it you wish, if I may ask? My husband and I have been separated for a long time. Your husband? He's in London? No, no, he's quite out of reach in Canada. Oh. One makes a mistake, And suddenly one's whole life is shattered. But perhaps it isn't too late, if our wish is granted. I don't understand. A beautiful woman like you, It shouldn't be necessary. No, you misunderstand me. It would be quite impossible to buy him back, Even if I were willing to do such a thing. Well, then... I want enough money to be independent, Then there can be no doubt in his mind. Perhaps you've both heard the Chinese proverb, "You can trust love only when there's nothing to be gained by it. " And you? What's yours? Do you know the long bar at the royal? Yes. Well, I'd buy it and move in. How much time have we left? 30 seconds. Do you realize what you're asking Kwan Yin to do? We want her to reshuffle a hand That destiny has already dealt us. Why? Because, uh, we hope to get higher cards. A little presumptuous on our part, isn't it? I wouldn't worry about it, if I were you. I won't. The lights! The matches! The matches! You just had them. Where are they? I think I saw them over here. I can't find them! I have the matches. You know, a moment ago, I- I could have sworn she was smiling at us. No. What more proof do you want? Can't you even believe what you see? But I can't say I saw anything. She opened her eyes. Kwan Yin kept her promise. Now the wish - If one's come true, so will the other. Yes, sir, and then, uh, even you will believe. Indeed I will. If you'll excuse me, I must be going along. Wait, I'll come with you. You've both been very kind. It was a pleasure, Missus-er... Shackleford. Crystal Shackleford. I go by the name of west. Johnny West. Arbutny is mine. Jerome K. Arbutny. We'll be back to share in the sweepstakes. I'll expect you. Good night. Good night. Good night. Oh, mister, didn't you forget something? What? My 3 shillings. Oh, that. If I may speak frankly, this has been A most unsatisfactory evening. Say, that couldn't be- Of course it is. The photograph. I never forget a face. It's Shackleford. She certainly works fast, that Kwan Yin. As far as I'm concerned, I never want to see this place again. Unless of course the ticket wins. Hello, Crystal. David! I knew it. I knew you'd come back. You expected me? Oh, not tonight, of course, But sometime, sometime soon. Well, I, uh, my boat just docked tonight. I thought you might still be up. And you came to see me right away. Oh, David, I'm so happy, I'm so terribly happy. As a matter of fact, I- I have something rather important I wanted to talk over with you. Yes? Well, that can wait. Until the morning, at any rate. Morning? But, Crystal, In view of everything that's happened between us- Everything that happened was my fault. I know that now. I'm terribly sorry for what I did, And I want to ask for your forgiveness. I don't hold anything against you, Crystal. As far as I'm concerned, the past is over and forgotten. Then let me make it up to you For all the selfish, hateful things that I did. I've missed you terribly, and you must have missed me. Don't, Crystal. Because in your heart- You're making it very difficult for me. It's best I speak plainly. What you want is impossible. All that's over and done with. We needn't go into reasons. You know them as well as I do. Reasons? B-But I'm a part of your life. You can't change that. During the time you've been away, I've found other interests, a new life. I'm only staying here Until my new appointment's been confirmed. I'm up for an important post With the dominions office. You're not telling me everything, are you? Well, as a matter of fact- Who is she? I know there's someone. Yes, there is. She's a girl I met in Canada, One of the old families of Montral. She came back with me. Aren't you afraid of a scandal? Scandal? Yes. Suppose the dominions office Would get wind of this... outside interest? But you don't understand, Crystal. Janet isn't an outside interest. I want to marry her. Isn't that a little premature Inasmuch as you have one wife already? Oh, legally we may still be married, But we haven't lived together for a long time. Under the circumstances, does it seem unreasonable That we should arrange for a divorce? Does she know you're a married man? Naturally. Oh, but of course you'd tell her. You're so honorable. Oh, please, Crystal, don't let's have any scenes. I've had enough of them to last the rest of my life. You like everything to be sugarcoated! "Civilized" is the word you always use. At least there's no reason why We shouldn't be kind to each other. Kind? Do you imagine you're being kind to me? After hoping and praying- Yes, praying that you'd come back And that we could be together again. This is all you have to say to me, That you want to marry somebody else. You think I'd give you up just like that? You're wrong! I'll never give you a divorce as long as you live! In that case, I don't think There's anything more for us to say. Still Kwan Yin, eh? Still an idol instead of a soul. How little you've changed, Crystal, In spite of all your fine words. Well, Alfred, I disagree with this boy. It's very simple: a life of good drinking Is worth the years of fainting. It's stupid. At least 10 years of fainting. What is it? We're closed. Woman: is Johnny there? Oh, Johnny. Johnny, Johnny, Johnny. You got to come back to the room. I will, I will, I will, But not before I've finished my drink. The Chinese say that haste is the one unpardonable sin. Oh, Alfred, anything you do for this lady, you do for me. It's a very special friend of mine, As the best friendships are made on short acquaintance And last a very brief time. This is miss Icy. This is Mr. Alfred Bluecrown, my favorite innkeeper. Pleased to meet you, miss. Same here. Johnny, you shouldn't have done it. Gabby's awful sore. Why did you slip out on him? Oh, I'd become unpleasantly aware Of my presence in that room, So when Gabby went out in the hall, I went outside to lose it. How did you find me? I looked in 10 pubs. Sorry for the other night. Anyway, you didn't get in no trouble? No, I was but a face in the crowd. That's not quite true- I- I was recognized, I was picked out from the rest. What? Oh, not by a bobby. Not even by a person, for that matter. It was ordained by fate In the image of a Chinese goddess. You've had too much to drink. We're going back to the room. Shh! Johnny. Shh. Good evening, Mrs. Proctor. Good evening. You know, Gabby will be so glad to see us. Gabby. It's me, Icy. It's me, Johnny. Yes, he'll be very happy. Very happy... Happy Chinese new year to you, sir. Now where have you been? Celebrating. Where was he? Blue crown. And that was only the last stop. You're drunk. Taken in sufficient quantities, Liquor will make you intoxicated. Do you want to put the rope around your neck? And mine? And Fallon's? No, that's the hangman's job. He'll get paid for it. Johnny. You always- Leave me alone! I didn't want to do it, But he don't learn! Johnny, Gabby don't want to hurt you. We ain't stopping you from drinking. You can drink all you want to in here. Only, please, Johnny, You mustn't get drunk on the outside. Mustn't get drunk on the outside. It's a wonder we don't go batty, What with you on our hands, In a fix like this. In times of trial a dictator says, "This, too, shall pass away. " Is that of any consolation to you, Gabby? I can't even trust you when I turn me back. Any more gin left? As if you didn't have An whole distillery in your belly as it is. From now on, you're not setting foot outside this room. You ought to be ashamed. Fallon gives us money to keep out of sight. You have to get drunk on it and show yourself. Fallon. What's it to me? What's it to you? Plenty, that's what it is. One man by himself can hold out. But when there's two or 3, They can be played against each other. And one of them always spills. Isn't it lucky I'm innocent? And if I'm known to be innocent, Will I then hang quite as high As you or Fallon? If you show yourself And get picked up and spill- If we get nabbed on account of you- Yeah? I'll swear to it you're as guilty as Fallon or me. You'll hang, I'll see to that. Gabby, I'll get him some gin. He can have it in here, where you can keep an eye on him. It's the last time I get into a fix Where I have to play nursemaid to a bloomin' idiot. Where will you get the money? Same place I got it before. Fallon ain't gonna keep forking out money To keep him swimming in gin! He wants an alibi fixed, don't he? Well, he'll have to fork out. If you put it that way to Fallon, he's gonna remember it when they turn him loose. That will be my lookout. I'll drop by with the gin in the morning. Yes, please, if it isn't too much trouble. It ain't no trouble. And the crown intends to prove That police officer brown, hearing cries for help From the night watchman, Donald Frye, Entered the building and called upon Bertram Fallon And the two persons unknown to surrender, And thereupon was brutally slain. And the crown intends to prove that the hand that fired the shot Which killed police officer brown was Bertram Fallon's- And that Bertram Fallon is guilty of murder. I call Donald Frye. The prisoner may sit. Is it true, Mr. Frye, That on the aforementioned night At the aforementioned address, You were attacked and beaten by two men? I was. Would you be able to identify them? One of them I could. Is he in this courtroom? He is. Would you point him out, please? Him in the dock, that's the one! That is all, Mr. Frye. I call officer Cummings. "Tell us what happened, officer Cummings, "From the time you heard patrolman Brown's whistle "Until you came upon his body? "Answer: first thing, I blew my own whistle, "Then I ran towards officer Brown's whistle. "Halfway up the block I heard pistol shots, 3 reports. "When I got to the end of the block, "Two suspicious-Looking characters came around the corner, One pulling the other one along, helping him. " Is that the way it was? You don't remember any of it? No, I don't. Not any. It's like it says in the paper. "The one who was doing the helping "Let go of the other, and then sprinted off. "So I grabbed onto the other one. "He seemed like something was the matter with him, "Like he might have been hurt, disabled, Or maybe he was intoxicated. " Intoxicated is right. Filthy drunk, you were. Filthy drunk. "I was about to put handcuffs on him "When I was struck from behind, a very hard blow that made me lose my senses. " Gabby. It's a wonder his head stayed on his shoulders. Why did you do it? Do what? Why did you help me, Why did you rescue me from the police? Why? Because I- Well, how would you like to wake up tomorrow morning And find yourself charged with murder, maybe? And not know why or anything? Give me a match. Was it you or Fallon who picked me out at the Blue Crown? Fallon it was. He bought you the drinks and made you the proposition. But why me? Because you was under the influence, I guess. Only he didn't suspect how much under. Well, I suspect one can hold one's liquor too well. Did he ever mention to me that you were planning to commit a robbery? Oh, not exactly. He told you he'd pay you 5 If you'd wait someplace for us and whistle If you saw a policeman. And I accepted? All you said was, "I'll take a whiskey and soda. " That's me. "Question... "Officer Brown died in your arms, "Did he not, officer Cummings? "Answer: he did. "Question: did he make a statement before he died? "Answer: he said, Fallon. Bertram Fallon. Those were his last and only words. " Why did Fallon have to kill him? I could have hit the bobby. Hittin' him would have been enough. I wonder what's coming next? Fallon's lawyer begins his defense. Begins his defense. Why he gets paid for it? Glad it isn't my job. Icy's a girl that can lie and make it stick. Yes, but that's called perjury, isn't it? Yeah? And what we're up for is called murder. It's only me- Mrs. Proctor. Good afternoon. Quite comfortable? Quite. You like your rooms? Why not? Got a nice view from the window here. You can look out, But no one can look in. That's the best to being on the third floor. Worth the walk up, for privacy's sake. Is it? You can get too much privacy sometimes. Then you get lonely. Oh, not you two gentlemen, of course. You've got each other for company. We're lucky that way. Even so, you might come down to the parlor one evening For a game of cards. No harm in a game of cards, I say. All depends on the people. You ain't forgetting? No, we are not forgetting. The rent-Is it the rent you want? One pound, 6 shillings, right? For the coming week, it'll be 10 guineas. Payable in advance. 10 guineas. You heard correctly. This is the time of year- Gabby, uh... Give Mrs. Proctor a few pounds in advance, and the rest of it you'll get in a few days. All right, ma'am? You can come and go as you please, Nobody will bother you-you're quite safe, you know. Yes, Gabby. It's not for us to tarry long. Let's go. It's a good thing you weren't drunk. If it hadn't been for you, I'd have done her in for sure. Arbutny: you're a fool! I say you're a fool! If you're not a fool, prove it! Yes, sir. Prove to me that you're anything else but a fool! I'll try, sir. Then prove it! I'm waiting. Yes, sir, yes, sir. What a disposition! When you've been here as long as I have, you won't mind. Well, I hope to heaven I'm not here as long as you. In the meantime, I suppose I shall have to take his insults And swallow my pride. Your pride? I bet you it ain't big enough to choke on as it goes down. Good morning. Lady Rhea Belladon to see you, sir. Well, show her in, show her in. Her ladyship must not be kept waiting. Lady Rhea. Mr. Arbutny. An unexpected pleasure. To what do I owe this honor? Wasn't I- I mean-I thought this is the date, or isn't it? The check? The check. And here is the receipt. The receipt? The bank receipt to show the money was deposited. So you see, everything has been taken care of. Everything. You are kind. Really, you think of everything. Lord Belladon wishes me to thank you for all you've done. Indeed? It's very kind of him. He knows how well you're watching after my interests. He tells me to trust you implicitly. You've, uh... Talked to him recently? Yesterday night we were together. He's, in, uh, good spirits, I hope? Excellent. Of course it taxes him, getting through. It's a long, arduous journey From the other plane to this. I can imagine. But we're both supremely happy Now that we've established communication. Ah, just think- It's been two long years since he passed away. Lady Rhea, may I inquire- Do you see him? No. I only feel him. His presence, that is. Really? Oh, to the very depths of my being. But his voice- I hear it quite as clearly as I do yours. Do you really? For the most part. Our conversations are of an extremely intimate nature. The things that pass between man and wife... Aren't intended for other ears. I wouldn't dream of inquiring. But also, he advises me On everyday matters. He does? We discuss everything and everybody. You in particular he esteems, Mr. Arbutny. It's very flattering. He says I'm to do everything you say, and anything. Ahem. Well, I must be on my way. You'll dine with me some evening, Mr. Arbutny. I shall be delighted. I believe dear Robin will, too. That's very good of Robin. Number, please. Whitehall 3040. National securities. Mr. Case. One moment, please. Hello? Case, Jerome K. Arbutny speaking. Yes, Mr. Arbutny. About that South African stock, I wonder if it would be wise to sell? It would mean taking a slight loss. Yes, I know. But you see, it's not exactly Within my, uh, scope of operations to speculate. There's a considerable amount of money involved. A very considerable sum. Well, that's for you to decide of course, Mr. Arbutny. But I have it on excellent authority That the stock's due for a turn. You say excellent authority? The very best. I see, I see. Well, for the time being, we'll let the account stand. Very well, Mr. Arbutny. Look here, Fallon, The crown's got an excellent case. Eyewitness and all that. This alibi better be airtight. Icy's testimony will be all right. Yes, but it isn't enough. We need corroboration. All right. We call in Major Beach. The major was with us the night it happened. All night-Ain't that right, Icy? That's right. Very well, then. But I better have a little talk with him. So long, Fallon. So long. Well, what are you waiting for? To tell me how much you miss me? How'd you know? What's on your mind? We need money. The devil you do! You've had 2 quid so far this week! They got to have money to keep undercover. Where in heaven's name are they hiding, in the Savoy? You know where they are. I've given them plenty for their room and grub. Johnny gets restless unless we keep him in booze. Too bad about Johnny. If he gets too restless, he gets caught. So what? We ain't gonna let him get caught. Oh, you ain't? Seems like you're taking pretty good care of him. You got him in this fix, I'm going to get him out. We need money. Suppose I say no? Then I'll say no tomorrow in the witness box. For tuppence I'd bust you up! And bust your alibi at the same time? It wouldn't be so good. Make up your mind, Bert. Do we get the money? I was with Bert- Mr. Fallon. We never left the house. You say you had a visitor. Yes. Major beach. Major beach is a good friend? Yes. How long have you known Major Beach? Oh, several years. Then you know all about Major Beach. Well, a good deal. And you would have me believe That you and the prisoner Spent a pleasant evening with this man, Whom you say you admire and respect? Yes. He told us about something that we'd never heard of before. Bert thought it was wonderful, And he was going to join up as soon as he could. That's all, miss crane. Defense: I call Major Beach. Bailiff: George Alfred beach. Major beach, on the night of October 16, Did you call at the prisoner's home? Yes. At what hour? About 8:00. Was anyone there besides the prisoner Fallon? Oh, yes, a friend of his. Miss Crane. How did the 3 of you spend the evening? We spent, uh, a quiet time. What do you mean By quiet time, Major Beach? A quiet time is a period of silence In which the parties present open up their souls To the divine spirit. I take it that you're interested In the oxford movement. Oh, I am, intensely. Did you have a particular purpose In calling on Mr. Fallon? Yes. I wanted to interest him in the movement. And did you succeed? Enormously. Mr. Fallon told me the quiet time had been a revelation to him. He felt like a different man. At what time would you say your quiet time ended? Oh, uh, it was about 12:00 when I looked at my watch. Hmm. Cross-Examine. Major Beach, Do you hold the rank of major in the British army? Uh... well, uh- As a matter of fact, I- Answer yes or no. Well, uh... "Major" is a sort of honorary title. Conferred upon you by yourself. Uh, yes... well, heh heh. You were in the army, however. During the war. A private. How long did you serve Before you were court-Martialed? Oh, well, uh... A m-Month. For breaking into medical supplies, Stealing drugs, and attempting to sell them. On which charges you were found guilty And sentenced to a military prison For the duration of the war. It was a miscarriage of justice! When did you become interested in the oxford movement, Major Beach? Oh, well, uh, let me see... About 5 years ago, I guess. In the past 5 years, Have you measured your conduct According to the precepts Of that organization? I might say so. Were you absolutely pure, Major Beach, In answering to a statutory charge In Melbourne, Australia, November 9, 1933? Absolutely. And were you absolutely honest In answering a drug charge October 13, 1936? Well, uh- Was it absolute unselfishness Which led on February 2, 1936, To your trial and conviction In Norfolk for perjury? I was entirely innocent! Is it absolute love for Bertram Fallon or for money That prompts you to give false testimony here and now? My lord, this man is obviously not A member of the oxford movement, Nor of any other religious body. Because of the proven incredibility And the devious character of the witness, I move that his entire testimony be stricken from the records. Motion sustained. Silence in the court! My lord, if it please the court, My client desires to change his plea From not guilty to guilty, and put his fate Into the merciful keeping of the court. If it please your lordship, he desires to make a statement. The prisoner may make a statement. My lord, I want to say I took part in the robbery. I told a lot of lies up to now, But mainly because I wanted to protect the others. But I don't see why a man ought to hang for a crime somebody else committed. I guess that's what's going to happen if I don't tell the whole truth. I'm not asking to be let off, All I want from this court is not to be hanged. If you won't hang me, I'll turn king's evidence. "I'll name the guilty ones And I'll fix it for you to catch them. " I don't want to hear it! Well, you said one of us would blow, Only you guessed the wrong one. Come on, Gabby, don't tell me that this thing Has destroyed your faith in human nature. All I want is to get me hands on Fallon. That's all I ask. Yes, but just that may be a little bit difficult. They're taking very good care of him these days. I'll find a way. Gabby, Gabby, I'm afraid you have a vengeful nature. It can't do you any good, you know, it's- Johnny? Gabby? It's me. Hello, hello. Welcome home. Fallon squealed. Don't I know. Let go of my arm, Gabby. Here's some grub. It's all I could scrape up. That'll come in handy. So Alfred of the Blue Crown Passed on the good tidings, huh? He just said the bridge, that's all. I've been an hour looking. It's a nice hideout. And much more pleasant than Mrs. Proctor's. Let me show you around. Well, first of all, we have southern exposure. And here, come here. There's a beautiful view of the river all the way- Not in the daylight! I'm sorry. It's hard to imagine one is not free With a sky overhead. Grub? I had some lunch, thanks. You know, I like it here. You think we can stay, or do we have to pay the city rent? We've got to move on, Johnny. Where? To monk varney's up in aberdeen. Aberdeen? And how do we get there? I've got it all fixed. Monk's got a car in a garage over on bristol street. I got the ticket. They'd pick us all up as soon as we showed our faces. Not Johnny, they wouldn't. They don't know him by sight. He could go over to the garage and meet us wherever we decide. I'm not going to aberdeen. Why not? I don't want to get too far away from Fallon. Oh. Gabby, you better duck till it's all over. And then you can come back. Oh, all right- But I'll come back. Johnny- I ain't never seen you eat. Not since you been with us. This is the first time. I think I'm sober. Talk, Johnny. I like to hear you talk. What about? Anything you have a mind to. What were you thinking just now? Nothing. I was looking at all the lights in all these houses. Yes? You see, each light cuts a tiny little circle out of the darkness, And each circle is the center of somebody's life. People swing around these lights Like planets swing around the stars. And we ain't got a light, is that what you're thinking? If I only knew half what you know, A lot of things would be different now. Hasn't helped me much. You're an odd number, Johnny. Gentleman, ain't you? Was born one. The booze? No, not the booze. The psyche. You know about the psyche? Psyche? It's what makes human beings of us. Is that a fact? That's a fact. Something is missing from mine. You know how it is with a man who loses his leg And how the leg he hasn't got itches And he goes to scratch it? Mmm. It's like that with a missing portion of my psyche anatomy. Whenever it itches, I take a drink. Tonight, it's itching like the devil. It won't be long now, Johnny. Just till we can get away, And then you can drink all you want. I promise you. I'm going to stick with you, Johnny. I'm going to look after you. What? Wherever you go, that's where I'm going, too. What are you saying? You see, nobody has never treated me The way you treat me. Johnny, I've been knocked about Ever since I was a kid. I can't remember anything else. I just thought that was the way people acted, That's all. You make me feel like- Like I was somebody. At first I thought you was making fun of me, But you're not. That's just the way you are. I'd hurt you more than anybody. You couldn't hurt a soul, Johnny. You can't even hate anyone. You don't even hate Fallon. No. That's right. If I could hate Fallon... I suppose I... I could love you. Funny. Whatever you say won't change what I'm going to do. Oy, Johnny. Say, it's time we were going, ain't it? I think just about, if I'm to meet you at 9:00. Have you got the car ticket? Yes. Icy gave it to me. Now, wait for us in the car Down the street from the Blue Crown. You know just where that is, don't you? I could find the Blue Crown in my sleep. Johnny, not in the Blue Crown. No, not in the Blue Crown. Down the street from it. Oh, you're sober. Johnny, this is our one chance to pull out of this. I know. Icy and me, we're trusting you. Get that. We're trusting you to stay sober Until you pick us up. I promise you, Gabby, by the big light in our ceiling, The one we are swinging around. It's all right, Gabby. He'll do like he promises. Nice violets, mister? Only sixpence a bunch. No, not tonight. Make your wife happy, it will. I haven't got a wife, and if I had one, A bunch of violets wouldn't make her happy. Uh, one minute. Violets, mister? No. I- I've changed my mind. I- I think it would make her happy. Oh, here's one, special nice. Thank you. Oh, thank you, sir. Watch out for yourself in back of you. On the wagon? Yes. Uh, I promised my wife-No more booze till the baby comes. So you're going to have a baby, eh? Well, we ought to drink to that. This is on me. No, thanks. You know, I've seen you before somewhere. I never forget a face. In fact, I can almost remember your name. It's, uh... James aloysius mergatroyd. Mergatroyd? That's funny. I would have said something else. You would? Yes. Now, let's see. You're about 5'5", brown eyes, dark hair, With a continental accent. In fact, you tally so closely To the description of a man named john west That I'm afraid we're going to have to take a walk In the direction of the nearest police station. Anything you say. Oh, by the way, is the invitation still good? Why, of course, Johnny. I was a little worried about that. That was the only thing that didn't check with our information: Your refusing a drink. Huh. In there getting himself tanked up he is. I knew we couldn't trust him. He'll be here in a minute, Gabby. I'm gonna fetch him, drag him out of there. No. Stay here. There may be coppers watching the place. Inspector, I guess where I'm going, I won't need these. It's a copper. He's got Johnny. What was it? You are lucky. You get the cell with the gramophone. It belonged to barry, Him who chopped off his uncle's head. Oh. He left it here for anyone to use Who might occupy this cell. That was 5 hangings ago. 5 ago. It's broke, the record, in the middle. It won't go any further. It keeps playing the same thing over and over again. Please don't do that. You know, it gets on the prisoners' nerves. I imagine it would. It's very simple. I'll show you. You see, you lift it up over here, Put it down there... yes. And the record plays as good as new. Wowonder whether it's the same with us who play it? Sir robert. Forgive me for coming to your club, But I simply had to see you. You're Mrs. David Shackleford? Yes. I've come to you because there's nobody else that I can turn to. Nobody. Indeed. It's about my husband, of course. He's in trouble. Trouble? Not serious trouble, I hope. What trouble, Mrs. Shackleford? He's up for a new post in the dominions office, isn't he? Yes. I recommended him. Oh, it will mean so much to him... And to me, too. There's every likelihood that the appointment will go through. I do want David to succeed. He can do great things. He can. He has the capacity. If only... Sir Robert, how much do you know of my husband's affairs, That is, his affairs outside the office? All I know about him is his work. He's intelligent, trustworthy- Not his work, But isn't it true that in government services, A man's deportment away from his work is equally important? Oh, not unless it's scandalous. But that's exactly what I'm afraid of - A scandal. All my hopes for him, all my dreams... Oh, sir Robert, you must advise him, talk to him, Make him see. He'll listen to you. You're his superior. In that case, I shall have to know what to advise him about. Oh, he'll come back to me. I know he will... As soon as the new wears off. She's nothing but a passing thing in his life. But it's more than I can bear to see him throw away everything, His entire future, for something that is only passing. David. Hello, Crystal. Why did you ask me to come here tonight? What good can possibly come of it? Must a wife have a reason For wanting to see her own husband? After all, you are still my husband. Is it necessary to keep reminding me of that? I thought there were some things you wouldn't want to forget. Do you remember when we were in china, All the strange places we visited? How everything we shared was so new and exciting? Till the excitement wore off. That didn't take very long, as I remember. And then you began to concoct your own forms of excitement. I told you I was sorry. Oh, I don't suppose you can help it. Emotions as violent as yours aren't apt to be very stable. No one man could hold your interest for long. Except you, David. In spite of the way I've acted, you still belong to me. You're the only one I ever really wanted. That's the way it seems to you now, But I don't think you really know yourself. You only want what you can't have For as long as you can't have it. That isn't true. I didn't come here to discuss this sort of thing. I had a faint hope that you might have changed your mind- Don't let's talk about it. You know I don't believe in divorce. If only you believed in something. I was forgetting... you do believe in her, don't you? I was so alone. I had to have something to turn to. May I have a light, please? Are you afraid of me? Haven't I reason to be? Then sir Robert told you? Everything. Even his regrets. He wasn't the only one that had regrets. David, you don't think I did that to hurt you, do you? Didn't you? No, I didn't. I did it for you, for us, To bring you to your senses. I can fix things with sir Robert. Oh.. I love you, David. You must believe me. I love you. Don't be afraid of me. I can give you everything that you want. I can make you happy. Give me a chance. I'm more to you than she'll ever be. Why didn't you do it? Are you afraid? No. That's what you want. You'd even give your own life to destroy mine, But I won't let you do it. Drew Detective Agency. Mr. Drew? Yes. Speaking. This is Mrs. Shackleford. Yes, Mrs. Shackleford? I wonder if you could get me some further information. It's about a friend of my husband's. Yes, a woman. Please, it's much easier for me If you don't hold anything back... Even if it's unpleasant. But, janet, darling, there's nothing new. It's just that I don't see much hope. She'll never change her mind. Never. Well, then the worst that can happen Is we go on as we are now. Oh, that isn't so bad, is it, David? Darling... Been? You're putting it in the past. Janet, I'm thinking of you. Sometimes I feel that the only decent thing Would be for me to get out of your life and stay out. David, you've no right to speak for me. Then there's your family. You'll be going back to Canada still unmarried. What'll they say? They're my family. Suppose you leave them to me. But, janet, darling, much as I love you, We can't go on like this forever, Neither married nor unmarried. It's bound to end badly. David, you've tried everything with Crystal, haven't you? Everything. Well, then, let me see what I can do. You go to Crystal? My dear, you know how she's behaved. Do you really imagine she'll be any different with you? Maybe she's in love with you, David. And sometimes love makes people behave very badly. Love-she doesn't know the meaning of that word. Well, anyway, the most she can do is refuse, And we can't be any worse off. No. I forbid you to see her. Darling, I only - Only want to protect you. Crystal's a very dangerous woman. I don't want you within her reach. David, I feel very tired. If you don't mind, I think I'd like to go back to the hotel now. Very well, my dear. Your maid let me in. Hope you don't mind. I'm Mrs. Shackleford. Oh. It's very strange, Mrs. Shackleford, your coming here. Just today I asked David if I might go to see you. But of course he was against it, wasn't he? Yes. And he probably invented all kinds of reasons. How like a man, how like David. What do you mean, Mrs. Shackleford? You know, miss Elliot, I had no idea you'd turn out to be this kind of a person. What kind of a person? Well, so completely without guile, So honest and trusting. What a shame. What do you mean? Huh. Someone has to tell you the truth, And since David evidently doesn't have the courage- Tell me what? Mrs. Shackleford, I feel you're implying all sorts of things. Would you mind speaking quite plainly? Very well. But you'll forgive me if what I have to say Isn't pleasant for you to hear. When David and I had some differences, Little things that seemed important at the time, And he went alone to Canada, I'm sure he thought in his heart that he could forget me. There he met you. Forgive me, miss Elliot, But I had no one to help me through my loneliness. I just waited and prayed for him to come back, And finally, he did. You were with him. The first night he arrived he came to see me. Did he tell you that? Yes, of course. Why should he have concealed it? He went to ask you for a divorce. That's true. When David came to see me that night, I think he sincerely believed that he was in love with you And that he wanted to be free. But, when he left me the next morning, He wasn't at all certain. Mrs. Shackleford, I don't see how you dare say such a thing. Aren't you forgetting he's my husband? But... David loves me. No, he didn't. It isn't true. He's very fond of you. But tell me the truth, miss Elliot. Is David the same as when you got to england? Or has he changed... just a little. No, he hasn't. I don't know what you're talking about. But you must. No... no, I don't think you've ever suspected. Every time I've been with David I've begged him to tell you... That it was only fair to you. But he's afraid of hurting you, And so he keeps putting it off. You're making all this up. David tells me everything. I know how you feel, And believe me, I'm sorry for you. But think of what I went through... The torture of having him and then not knowing. And I'm his wife. He belongs to me. But it isn't only David and I any longer. Miss Elliot, I've come to you Because I must have him back-I must. David and I are going to have a child. Oh, please. I can't stand any more. I'm so sorry. I'll do anything you want, Mrs. Shackleford, anything. Only, please go. And I haven't the money, Mr. Case. I trusted in your judgment when I bought the stock. You must give me more time, a few more days. I'll take the risk. Unless you have your margin in your hand by the close of business tomorrow, We'll be forced to close out your account. But you can't do that. It will be my ruination. Blast you, why did you get me into this? I told you I didn't want to be a speculator. Now I'm ruined, and it's all your fault Blast you. Ruination... he said ruination. Shh... maybe he's broke a blood vessel. Crikey! Regent 2110. He ain't had a stroke. No such luck. Speaking of luck, how about a ticket for the sweeps? I got a book of them here. No, I never win anything. Lady Rhea, this is Mr. Arbutny. Lady Rhea: what is it, Mr. Arbutny? There's a matter of importance, lady Rhea, to talk over with you. I wonder if I could take advantage of your dinner invitation? Why, of course. Would tonight be convenient? Tonight? Why, that would be perfect, yes, indeed. Then, 7:00? Arbutny: delightful dinner. Most enjoyable. Delightful. Lady Rhea: but you've barely touched it. Oh, I ate heartily, Yes, indeed, most heartily. Would you like some brandy, Mr. Arbutny? Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Napoleon... my husband's favorite brand. Mine, too. Thank you very much. Sit here, Mr. Arbutny. Thank you very much. And now you have something to tell me. After dinner, you said. Oh, yes, yes, quite, of course. Excellent brandy, excellent. I, uh... well, I, uh... It's like this. Like what? It's hard rather getting started... Not easy putting into words... Saying what I have to say. What makes it so difficult? Is anything the matter? Oh, no, no, no, absolutely not. To the contrary- Handy gadget. Is it? Oh, yes... always works. Always. Unless that is, it needs a new flint or something. Then, sometimes I forget to put fuel into it. Do you? Oh, yes, but that's a rare occurrence, very. You were about to say... Ah, yes, yes... Lady Rhea, I hope - Believe me, I do not wish to offend. I mean, I have the highest respect for your rank, lady Rhea, And for you yourself. Only too well aware of the difference between our stations. Oh, friendship bridges such things. I hope so... friendship and... Love. Love, Mr. Arbutny? Love, yes. Two years since lord Belladon passed on, isn't it? Two long years. And you are a woman, well, in the prime of life. Ooh... Definitely. I am convinced firmly that lord Belladon himself Would approve, otherwise... Otherwise? Otherwise I wouldn't dream of making such a request. Request, Mr. Arbutny? Yes, the honor of filling his place. You mean...? Marriage... exactly. If I've offended in any way... Oh, marriage, I... I'm quite overcome. Will you have a glass of water? Thank you, no. You forget one thing, Mr. Arbutny... That although lord Belladon is only a memory to you, For me, he's a reality. To be sure, he returns, I know, But he's not flesh and blood, I mean. That is between us. You'd never guess. His visits- They needn't stop. I'm afraid lord Belladon wouldn't be so broad-Minded. If I've offended in any way... Shh! What is it? I believe... I believe he's coming. Yes, he is. He is coming. Please go. Go quickly, Mr. Arbutny. I'll tell you tomorrow what Robin lord Belladon thinks. Good night, lady Rhea. Do you think West's guilty? Perhaps, perhaps not. He'll hang, I'll wager. That's another matter. Odd number-West. Talks like a gentleman when he talks, The papers say. If he's a gentleman, more's the reason he ought to hang. He's had advantages. Not one word in his own defense. "What's the use of wasting my breath?" He says. "Wouldn't be believed anyway. " "The director of the barrister's club Take pleasure in placing your application before the membership. " Ah! "You will kindly furnish the names "Of 4 persons prepared to make... Certification of your character and personal integrity. " Good afternoon. Come in. Lady Belladon to see you, sir. She's here? Show her in. Ah, Mr. Arbutny. Lady Rhea, my dear. Sit here, my dear. Thank you. I've been waiting. And do you feel today as you felt last night- If you even remember the things you said? Do I? I mean, of course I do, absolutely. Well, I don't know how to tell you. It isn't necessary. I mean, I know. I'm sorry. Sorry? Why? You will. We ought to be married. Lord Belladon was furious, simply furious. Oh... Quite unreasonable, a very jealous nature, lord Belladon's. He simply raved and ranted. He did? Oh, how he carried on! He made all kinds of accusations. Accusations? Against you and me. He simply wasn't to be reasoned with. Among other things, He said you were simply after me for my money. Imagine... as though you ever had such a thought. You must know different. Of course, but I couldn't convince lord Belladon. He suspects you of all kinds of things. He suspects? Yes, and to make his mind at peace, I promised to have the books examined. Surely...? Oh, only to humor him, you understand? You don't intend... Well, a promise is a promise, So, I asked Mr. Gaising to meet me here. Who is Mr. Gaising? The accountant. May I tell him to come in? Oh, no, lady Rhea. I mean, wait... why must you do this? There's no harm in having the books examined. But it's such short notice. It's not customary. Under the circumstances, you will consent. Mr. Gaising... Oh, but the books aren't in order. I mean, there are several entries to be made. It will require some bookkeeping. Mr. Gaising, while you're going over the books of 1936 and 1937, Mr. Arbutny will have plenty of time to make additional entries. Isn't that so? If you'll be so kind, Mr. Arbutny. Very well, lady Rhea. You'll give the books containing lady Rhea Belladon's account, 1936 and 1937, to this gentleman. Yes, sir. Good afternoon, lady Rhea. Good afternoon, Mr. Arbutny. Good day. "The directors of the barrister's club... " "Character and professional integrity... " Afternoon paper, sir. Thank you. Beg pardon, sir? Thank you very much. Not at all, sir. Take the rest of the afternoon off. You may both take the rest of the afternoon off. Beg pardon, sir, but are you feeling quite all right? Quite all right, thank you. He thanked me, he did. What's that? Like the ground slipping out from under my feet, it was. He thanked me twice, he did, fancy. Thanked you? You don't say? Furthermore, he says we may take the afternoon off. I don't believe it. He did. I swear he did. Well, if he said so... Let's hop it. Kwan Yin! Kwan Yin! Well, Mr. Arbutny. What do you think now? As I said before, I'm not one to believe in miracles, and yet... And yet you're not unwilling to profit by them. What about that fellow west? The murderer? What about him? He's got a share. Shouldn't he be notified? He won't need it where he's going. Quite so, but he may have relatives. I mean, would it be strictly honest? Very well. Notify him if you wish. As a matter of fact, I think you're probably right. Under the circumstances, it might be somewhat cruel. And your share will be larger, of course, If you spare him the knowledge. Well, yes, both our shares would. 10,000 it's worth, and more. It could be worth many times more when the race is run. If the horse we've drawn wins, yes. But it would be foolish to count on that. The only sensible procedure is to sell our ticket For what we can get right now rather than speculate and take the risk. Oh, come now, Mr. Arbutny. That's not very sporting of you. Don't you remember that we agreed That the ticket should not be divided? The entire sum must go in the race. When we made that agreement, it was only as a joke. I wasn't joking. That'd be madness even to consider betting such a sum on a horse race. Mrs. Shackleford, circumstances are such with me... A situation has risen- That is, I have a very pressing need for immediate funds. I simply cannot afford to take such a risk. There's nothing that I can do about it. But you can! You must understand that this is a very serious matter. If I don't get my money for the share of that ticket right now, Well, I would be ruined. Mrs. Shackleford, what are you laughing at? I was just thinking how easy it is to be ruined. One minute to have everything, The next to have nothing. But they got what they deserved. They got exactly what they deserved. Mrs. Shackleford, I'm afraid I don't understand you. All I'm asking is- Of course you don't understand me, Mr. Arbutny. You never could. But that's not the point. That is, all I wish is to divide our respective shares. I'd be willing to take less than my half. Mr. Arbutny, understand this. We made a pledge, and we're sticking to it to the letter. Oh, no. No, Mrs. Shackleford. But you can't hang him. He didn't know what he was doing! Fallon rang him in on it. Johnny didn't even know what happened Until he read it in the papers. Miss crane, that's even more difficult to believe Than the story you told in court. But this is the truth. I swear it is. You may recall you took an oath in the witness box... A solemn oath to tell the truth And nothing but the truth. That was wrong. I shouldn't have done it. Not if you hoped to make us believe this story. But you know I'm telling the truth now. I came in here of my own free will And gave myself up to you. Doesn't that prove it? There's no reason to lie for Johnny. How do I know that? It's not inconceivable that you'd do more for west Than you would for Fallon. Oh, that ain't got anything to do with it. Please, you've got to believe me this once. Johnny's innocent. I tell you, he's innocent. Miss Crane, you're very convincing. But unfortunately, you were very convincing the last time. A court of justice has passed sentence on west, And the case is closed. Except that I must hold you on a charge of perjury. I don't care what you do with me. What's the time? 10:00. We'll be in reading within the hour. And there I shall remain... For the rest of your natural life. You must have preferred it to hanging Or you wouldn't have pinched on your pals. Even if I am a policeman, I hate a squealer. What is it? Conductor. Your ticket, sir. Gabby! West? Already? Nope, Fallon's been killed. He's dead? Yes, and they got the fellow what done it. Timothy Delany's his name. That's Gabby! And before Fallon died, he made a confession Which took the blame off you. And if what he says is true, Well, you ain't gonna be hanged. That's all I know about it. That's sufficient. That's wond- The governor wants to see you in his office. All right. Pardon me, please. Isn't that wonderful? Johnny... I was hoping I'd see you coming through. Hello, Gabby. Hello, Johnny. Anything I can do for you? Somebody you want me to see? Nothing I can think of, Johnny. Nah, no, there ain't. Where is Icy? Oh, didn't you hear? They got her in the klink for perjury. She tried to get you off. She did? Yeah. Anyway, they'll go easy on her now. I'm sorry about- I ain't. That Fallon... I wish I had it to do over again. Well, you're a free man now, Johnny. Yes, I'm... I'm a free man now. Good luck, Johnny. Good-Bye, Gabby. Good-Bye, Johnny! And how are you, sir? Lovely day, ain't it, governor? Yeah, wonderful. Perfect weather for the race. What race? The grand national, of course. Who do you think will win? What horse you picking? I don't pick horses. You don't? I got a bob up on corncracker. Corncracker on the nose, a lovely horse. A lovely horse, and if I had more, I'd bet it. I wish I owned a ticket on the favorite. Half of it I'd sell, and the other half I'd let ride. Not like her... Crystal Shackleford. And she ain't selling any part of her ticket-Imagine! Pardon me, what was the name you mentioned? Crystal Shackleford. She owns the ticket on corncracker. I'm glad I got my bob down when I did. Corncracker's a 3-1 favorite. Crystal Shackleford. Mrs. Crystal Shackleford. Winning ticket 666291/j, pseudonym Kwan Yin. A fast horse... a fast track. Why, it could- Well, I'll be. Is miss Elliot in? Why, Mr. Shackleford, I thought you knew. Knew? Knew what? Miss Elliot left the day before yesterday. Left? That's impossible. Well, nearly impossible, But we managed to get her passage at the last minute On a boat that was just sailing for Canada. But she must have left some... Some message for me. Well, I'm afraid not. Perhaps she tried to reach you and... Yes, that's it, I'm sure. I've been out of town. Thanks. She may have given your wife a message. My wife? Yes, she was here the day before. Miss Elliot was out at the time. Your wife gave her name and asked if she might wait in her room. And knowing that you were friends with miss Elliot, I... I say, is anything wrong, Mr. Shackleford? Mr. Harris, arbutny speaking. Yes. Meet me on the corner of conduit and regent street in half an hour. Will you please bring the check? I will have the ticket for you. Man: big race today! Buy a paper. Racing special... corncracker the favorite. Get your paper here. Man on radio: post time is 2:00, And as we're getting on to that about now, You may expect, I think, to hear the summons of the starting line. Mrs. Shackleford, I'm not asking. I'm demanding. Do you hear what I say, Mrs. Shackleford? What? I'm not going to gamble my share. No? You must give me the ticket, you must! I have a man waiting downstairs to buy it. There's just time before the race! Half of what I get out of it, I'll give to you, And you can do with it as you like, bet it or not! You're wasting your breath. Radio:... except for fog, Crystal: oh, it's you! But I thought that- oh, isn't it wonderful, the most.. Mr. West. Mr. Arbutny. So you did come back after all. When did you find out? About the ticket? Only about 10 minutes ago. I'm dying for a drink. Oh, madam Kwan Yin. Arbutny: Mr. West, if I could have a word with you. You're a lady of your word- What's the trouble, Mr. Arbutny? Are you so disappointed I wasn't hanged? No, to the contrary, I don't know how it is you're here, But I'm glad, believe me. That ridiculous agreement we made about not selling any part of the ticket. I hope you don't intend to hold me to it. He wants to back out. There's no reasoning with her. You must help me get my share now, Mr. West. I want to sell it before the race. I can't afford to gamble. No? Why? Because I need the money. See, I'm a thief... At least I shall be a thief in the eyes of the world Unless I get this money. I'm not truly a thief. I'm an honest man, Mr. West, believe me. I meant no harm when I did what I did. My intentions were perfectly honorable. When I explain to you the circumstances, I'm sure you'll understand. I am the trustee of an estate, An estate of several thousand pounds. It was my duty to invest the money, The law says, in government securities, First mortgages, and certain other preferred stock. But I saw a chance of making a large profit for the estate By investing in common stock. Do you follow me? In a general way. It was my intention- My perfectly honorable intention- Should the unexpected happen and the stock fall off a few points To make it up, the loss, out of my own savings. Believe me, I'm telling you the truth. Oh, but then the stock fell too low, And now you need this money to make up for the loss. That's precisely what happened, precisely. You understand my case perfectly. If I don't make it up, I'll be disgraced. In fact, I shall be sent to prison Like any common criminal. Oh, excuse me, Mr. West. Mr. Arbutny, I believe in sticking to a bargain, Especially when a gamble is involved. But as far as I'm concerned, you may have your third. Thank you! Thank you! Radio: he's supposed to be very fit. His odds are quoted at 20-1. Arbutny: did you hear what he said, Mrs. Shackleford, I can have my third as far as he's concerned. It's two against one. Do you hear me?! It's two against one! Radio: the favorite is, of course, the 5-Year-Old corncracker. At 3-1, a really handsome horse with a long back... Time is nearly up. Mrs. Shackleford, you must give me that ticket! It's a matter of life and death! Mr. West, will you stop that playing at a time like this! Why? Because... because... Can't you see what's happening to me? Well, why don't you sit down and rest? How can I rest? I must have that ticket. A man is waiting on the corner with a check only a block away. I must have it! Make her give it to me, Mr. West. Make her give it to me now! Or it will be too late! What can I do about it? It's up to her. Radio: the horses, I see, are now coming up on to the track According to their post positions. And except for the scratches, The post positions of the horses, As in the papers. Mrs. Shackleford, for the last time, will you give me that ticket? It means nothing to you. If I don't have that money, I've lost everything. I've lost everything, too. And everybody... Except one. Mrs. Shackleford! No! You may not have the ticket! Don't ask me again. I warn you, money means more to me than my life. It means my honor. I was going to kill myself because I didn't have the money. It means more to me than your life, Than all our lives. You must give me the ticket! You must not try and stop me, Mrs. Shackleford. Believe me, you must not. Out of my way, Mrs. Shackleford. No! No! Take your hands off it! Take your hands off-! Radio: and they're off! It's dolomite, sagittarius... Get some whiskey quick! Radio: Tarlatan lies still And the remainder of the field avoids him. He's getting up now uninjured. Dolomite leads by less than a length. Outsider is running nose and nose... She's all right, isn't she? She's not all right. Mr. West? She's dead. Oh, no, no. You better drink what you have in your hand. Radio: with the long shot a length and a half in the lead. Arbutny: oh, Mr. West. Maybe she isn't... Sometimes gives the appearance... When the person's only unconscious. I tell you, she's dead. She is dead. Radio: neck and neck past the grandstand... They're coming to the finish. And corncracker wins! Corncracker. Did he say Corncracker? Kwan Yin's horse. Kwan Yin... The ticket! Oh... How much is it worth? 30,000. 30,000! 15,000 apiece. We'll be rich! Aren't you forgetting something? What? Isn't there another name with ours on that ticket? Oh, what are we to do? First thing, the ticket has to be destroyed. Beg your pardon? Don't you see? The agreement on the back of that ticket with our names... That's the only connection between her and us. It wouldn't look very good for either of us. Destroy the ticket? Destroy 30,000? Don't think for a moment the idea appeals to me either. Oh, what I couldn't have done with my share of that money, But now, this ticket! It looks like a signed confession of murder! But it wasn't murder. I'm not a murderer! Really! No more than I'm really a thief. I had no wish to kill her. Just something took possession of me. Lifted my arms, and I could do nothing to stop it. Perhaps you're right. Maybe you couldn't help it. But it will be very difficult to convince a jury. Come, give me the ticket. When we leave here, I'll destroy it. Anything you say, Mr. West. I can't think anymore. You tell me- Come on, drink your drink. All of it. Drink your drink. This is an evil room. She was a very beautiful woman. She was a devil. Devil! Come on, Mr. Arbutny. I'm sure we are being watched, Mr. West. Come on. She's laughing at us. Let's go. Let's go. You're safe now. If only she'll remain here behind us. But I'm afraid... I'm afraid. Are we being followed? No, we are not. One can't see her, of course... Nor hear her. One can only feel her presence. She's following us. I'm sure of that. She'll follow wherever I go! Will you be quiet if you know what's good for you? But I... I feel her presence. She's not two paces behind. Please, be quiet! How can I be quiet When I know the devil's abroad? The people in the street should be notified. I should cry out the truth. But you won't! I will! I will! It is my duty regardless of consequences. I'll shout out a warning from the housetops So all may know and hear the truth. It is my duty. You, sir... You, sir, I have something to tell you. Never mind... My friend had one drink too many. If you don't be quiet now, I'll leave you right here. Let go of me, sir. I must speak. The devil's abroad! Murder has been committed! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! I tell you, the devil is beside me. True, you cannot see her nor hear her, But nevertheless she's at my side. You wish proof? I'll give it to you. A stone's throw from here is the room. In that room is a dead woman. She was murdered! Man: been a murder, he says, a woman! It's true, and I'd be glad to lead you to the victim. Man: who murdered her? Why, the devil, of course, I was her instrument. I struck the blow! The devil was responsible! The devil! I myself struck the blow, But the devil was responsible! Give us a half-And-Half. Same here. Billy Johnson had 5 bob. I'd have had a bet on it meself But me missis wouldn't have it. How about you, pal? Did you have anything on the winner? What winner? Blimey, where have you been? Haven't you heard that the cracker won the national? No-Oh, yes, yes. Some lucky blighters was in on it. I know one woman, she had a ticket on... Did you see him? I was just trying to make a little polite conversation. Some blokes can't stand to see anyone else having any luck. You forgot this, Mr. West. Thank you. First time I've known you to walk away from a drink. You looking for somebody, ducky? Johnny! Johnny! Johnny, I'm so glad to see you. Welcome home. I missed you so, Johnny. They let me off easy. How have you been getting along, Johnny? Icy, don't ever get mixed up with a Chinese goddess. No, Johnny. That's the worst thing that can happen... The very worst. Johnny, you're not in trouble again? No, I'm not in trouble. Not anymore. Found out just in time. Found out what? Oh, that things don't just happen to us, That we can do something about them. The fault lies not in our stars. It lies in ourselves. Yes, some people have to go to prison to be free, you know it? I even had to win a sweepstake ticket. Sweepstake ticket? Johnny, do you mean it? Yes, that's it. The winning ticket. What did they win? No, Johnny! Oh, Johnny, For a minute there you had me believing it. So help me, you had. I thought it was real.
