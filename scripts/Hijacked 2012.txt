There was an interesting bundle of files which basically a dossier on this Billionaire Bruce Lieb and his companies. - I think he's a target. - It sounds more like a backer. Yeah, that's what I thought as well, but then I found this. It's a manifest for his private jets for a flight leaving Paris tonight. It's a detail assessment about his security procedures, his flight personnel... ..As well as his technical specs of the aircraft itself. - But that's not the kicker. - Go on There were references to several holdings in the companies. And one of them is the IIU. Follow the money. - Sir? - Shit! I'm no longer clear to be anywhere near this. I don't really think that anyone else need to know. I'll be honest with you both. I really really hate this shit. We know, Bruce. But the SEC didn't call you in for tea. Your testimony tomorrow put we all to bed. Testimony? You told me this was a friendly interview.

I've been here for charity, not subject for the SEC crime. Mr. Lieb, one question sir. Listen, everyone. Its just a formal inquiry. That's all. Everything will be clear tomorrow. And it the Commission will provide you everything that they feel that the public should know. But let me just take this opportunity to tell you... We raised over 5 million dollars for needy children all around the world. And we're about to do the same for some needy kids in Washington DC. So let's not forget the bigger picture here and take our eyes off the ball. - Thank you so much for your time. - Mr. Lieb... I've nothing else to say. - They have a beautiful garden. - Have you been there? No I haven't. It's very beautiful. Unfortunately we have to cut this short Hey, gents. Steve.

Is that a new girl in the red dress? What's about that blonde? That blonde is married to one of Lib's biggest donors Yeah, they're both kinda young. Family money, gentlemen. Young people with privilege. They probably hate each other. Nothing makes Tara and I happier, than contribute to the foundation. The work that charity does is outstanding. We really appreciated all that you guys had done. And as a show of appreciation, Mr. Lieb would like to make his favourite chef available to you during your stay in New York That's very generous. Well, honesty your generosity what makes this all possible. I'll let you two settle in. You'll be in stair room no. 2 and once we're airborne, it's all yours.

Please, do me a favour, keep it down. - It's a better hell of a poker game. - Agent Ross, Otto Southwell. - How are you doing, mate? - Good to meet you. Yeah, you too. I'm going to need you to ground this plane. That's not going to happen. Bruce is aware of the intelligence, but he's not willing to ground the plane. - Does he understand the seriousness? - He didn't see it that way. Is there any chance I speak with him? Sure. This way. Boos's cabin is state of the art, build out of titanium and totally seal. Direct video feed, straight into the state room. Bruce, Agent Ross's here to speak to you. Thanks Excuse Otto. They're waiting for you in the vehicle. Right, see you around mate. You can trust yourself when all men doubt you But make allowances on their doubting too. and that is one of my favorite poem. 'If' by Rudyard Kipling. - Please, can I offer you a drink? - No, thanks. Sir, this flight... Listen, Agent Ross, I must truly apologize. I mean, you must think I'm.. I'm some sort of stubborn idiot. The fact is, I've got a very very important meeting tomorrow. and any absence of delay on my part can be truly detrimental to my entire enterprise Yes, I heard. But sir you got a bigger issue on this flight. I wasn't able to give details to Otto... ..but I believe you're the target of a powerful international criminal syndicates. I don't understand. I mean why'd I be an interest of a criminal syndicates? I'm not sure. But these are not thugs with guns. These guys manipulate markets, and they create insurgencies to start wars. We found the dossier that contains several of financial for your companies. Maybe they'll on this flight witch hunt. It's possible. But you can see why it causes concern that they have all the details to your flight. Now I'm not in the position to delay the departure. But if you choose to fly, I strongly recommend you double all your security efforts. Yeah, yeah, of course. Unfortunately, I have no say in the matter and I really appreciate your giving all this information. Look, I know this is highly against protocol.. ..but I would a lot more at ease maybe if you were to join us on this flight. Well I don't that would be necessary, but I'll be happy to talk to Otto. Whenever you change your mind. - Thanks. - Good luck. - How are you, Pierre. - Good evening, sir. You sure you don't want to come with us tonight?

Big boy. - Michelle went shopping again. - Yeah I can see that. Alright mate, give my regards to your family. Thanks. Have a safe trip. I definitely love to find time later on the flight to over the budget.. ..for the up coming benefit in New York. - Most definitely. - Great. Love to catch a drink soon. Liv, what the hell are you doing here? Would you please excuse me, Eric? Sam, he's ready for you. - Look, you can't be on this flight. - Are you out of your mind? What the hell are you doing showing up here? This has nothing to do with us. No, you're right this has everything to do with me. This is my work Paul. Are you okay? I'll be fine. Let me know if you need anything. - Come here. - The Tribe is targeting Lieb. Paul, stop. I had to listen to 4 years of this relentless obsession of yours and you know what I think? I think if there's actually a real threat... That the CIA actually thought was real. They would actually be here. - Would you Listen.. - No, I'm not listening. Just...stay away from me. Do we have a problem? - No problem. - Good. Would you tell Lieb I'll accept his invitation? Yeah Can I get you something to drink? - Beer and soda. - Not feeling well? No, I'm just fine.

Look keep an eye on Otto Southwell. He used to be special ops, and he's been with Bruce for years. - We should take him out. - Absolutely not! We may need him. He's the only one who can get to Bruce's chamber. - We'll handle it. - Fine. - You'll wait for my signal. - So what's your signal? When all is set. I'll give it a go. - That means, your signal is Go. - I'm sorry, can you repeat that? Hey, let's knock this off on a good note. I've got my end to covered. Keep yours in check. How do we end up with her? He's Lieb's half-sister. Wants her piece, before big brother goes down. Who says blood was thicker than water? Jack and Ginger. It's a peace offering. May I sit?

Was that necessary? - Sorry, I got excited. - Try to control yourself. - What did you do? - Where are the others? There's four in the main cabin, - Does the cockpit secured? - Cohen got it under control. - Go keep him occupied. - No more of this. Don't worry. Everything will be okay. Who the hell is Cohen? Cohen's a good pilot. He'll get the job done. Alright let do this. You, take it easy to that thing. When we land, we should go to that place we went to last time. Oh yeah. The catfish? So good. Looks like the love birds are finally done. Excuse me. Come in. - Enjoying everything? - Yeah, it's going okay. - Just okay? - Just okay. - Gin and tonic. - Make it a double. - Bad day? - Yes, something like that. - Hi there. - Hey. We haven't met. - Paul. - Michele Lieb. - Nice to meet you. - Pleasure. - What happened to you? - A little accident. That's not good. You have to take better care of yourself. Here's to being more careful. Hey, Steve. Can you open the door? I just buzzed you it. It didn't work. Can you try it again? Yeah, sure. Okay. Try it now. Nope, still nothing. Hmm, that's odd, must be some sort of malfunction. - Why don't you check the breaker. - Yeah. Okay. Get his gun. Alright, everybody on your feet! You heard the woman, move it now! Hands on your heads! Everybody, hands on your heads, right now! Get up! Back of the plane! Do you have a weapon? Lock your fingers above your head and turn around! Okay everybody downstairs to the back of the plane! Go! Go! Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm. I apologize that you had been detained against your will. But if you cooperate, no one will get hurt. At least no one else. They wont be any heroes tonight Mr. Southwell. I'm the hero. Think of me as a Robin Hood. I rob from the rich and give to the poor. You've met my band of married-men. Bruce Lieb is a corporate raider who's stole billions from people all over the world. Tonight he'll get a lessons in justice. I'm going to separate him from his ill-gotten games. If you do not interfere, you'll be witnesses. But if you try to get in my way, you'll be collateral damage. What is it you want? Name your price, I can make all of this go away. You must be the lawyer. Don't make promises you can't keep. What exactly do you think you can do for me? Unless you've billions of dollars you can transfer to the next half hour, I suggest you shut the fuck up! That's not very cooperative, Mr. Southwell. Keep everyone here. If they move, kill them! Grab the girl! Let's go! Please, let me go, please. Tie everybody up! - Jesus, ease up. You're hurting me! - Very convincing. Otto, talk to me, what the hell is going on? Mr. Lieb, my apologise. But Mr. Southwell is indisposed. - And who the fuck am I talking to? - The name is aren't important. What is importantly is we've taken over this aircraft. I'm hoping you'll make this easy for everyone. I prefer if you come out so we can discuss this like gentlemen. But I don't think you're going to do that. So, here's what you are going to do. You're going to transfer 2.73 billion dollars our number account. And you going to do that within the next hour, or people will begin to die. I can't do that. There's no way that I can do that. Mr. Lieb, you can and you will. There's a full first aid kit in the medical crash cart on board. Please, he's bleeding badly let me help him. He will wait until I say so or he dies. At least let me stop the bleeding. Make it quick. What's your emergency protocol? Once I pressed the panic button, the cockpit door sealed, so is Lieb's cabin. And the pilots? Contact Air Traffic Control, and land at the nearest airport. These people are good. They wouldn't gone without having the cockpit controlled. Enough! Get away from him! Bruce. Please Bruce just do what he says! Please I'm begging you, just think about what you're doing. Please, just let her go. Jesus Christ, Bruce! He's got a fucking gun to my head! Just give him what he wants! Bruce! Please don't make me kill her, Mr. Lieb. It's so tedious. Please, just let her go. Bruce! Fuck you, Bruce! Just give him you piece of shit. Just give him the fucking money you coward. God damn it! My God. What did you do? What did you do? Listen you selfish prick, whether you come out or not, you're dead unless I get what I want. You listen to me... I just can't transfer billions dollars just like that. I going to need time. I've to talk to the board. There are going to be questions. There going to be lots of questions. Then answer them. For now, get a pen and write this down. ROYAL BANK OF GENEVA ACCOUNT NUMBER: 2127376160 You got 10 minutes. Then you'll start to lose your top people. Clean this up. Otto! - Get away from him now! - He's in cardiac arrest. - I need the crash cart from the front cabin. - Please, let me get it. Sit back down! - Good job. - Nice acting. Take the scissors from the cabinet. Hurry up. They must've come from the cargo hull. I'll check it out see what we're up against. I'll go with you. I got to find a safe place for Liv. We got a short window to get them out of here. I want everyone to spread out and hide. Don't make it easy for him. Come on let's go. Come on. Listen carefully, you guys should be safe here. If you feel the need to move, make your way to the main cabin. There are lots of room to hide there. Until then, stay out of sight. I'll back as soon as I can, alright? - Hey, Paul. Be careful. - I'll be okay. Now you listen to me, you need to transfer that money and you need to transfer it now. Are you sure they're serious? I just watched them blow my sister fucking head off. They're serious. Bruce, we have to go to the FBI on this. It's the only responsible thing we can do. and what for? So they can fly up here in a secrets plane, and rescue us? What I'm telling you now if that's the only plan you got, I'd rather jump. I agree. No authorities. A word of this gets out, our stock will plummets. We'll lose any chance we may have to recover. I don't believe we may have that much. Even if we liquidate our entire cash reserves. It doesn't seems that we have any other option. Eric will know what we can pull. Bruce, is he with you? He was, he's outside. I don't know. I really don't know. Cohen. - How does it look? - We're going have to improvise. What are you talking about? There's a weather ahead that looks bad, a hail-storms. We're not going to make it to the ground. What do you suggest? Like beaches? Hold this. Rostow, the hostages have escapes. You have got to be kidding me. I'm on my way. Steve, just get us on the ground, I don't care how you do it. You figure it out. Where the hell do you think you're going? Downstairs. Go! Don't give me a reason. Move! What the fuck happened?! - He took my gun and my comms. - The big guy? I gave you one job. Make yourself useful and tie him up! Come on. Fuck! Fuck! So they extort the money and they jump. Yeah. - What the hell is that? - It's a cricket bat. They going to get to a much lower altitude to jump. Yeah they are. Otto, I assume that you and your big ugly friend can hear me. So listen up! I was mistaken to think that you cooperate. So play time is over. And you! The big guy. Are you listening? You ugly fuck, I'm coming looking for you! - The jackass is talking shit now. - Ignore him.. Mr. Lieb, where are we? Look, I'm going to be really honest with you. Nothing can happen until you talk with Eric Elmwood Who the fuck is Eric Elmwood? He's the CFO in our company. Christ! Good evening, gentlemen of the board. You're not going to get away with this. As your new larger shareholder, I'd like to submit a resolution dealing with corporate governance and executive compensation. No. No. Please, don't hurt me. Where the fuck is Eric? - He's in the one of the state room. - Where? He's in the one of the state rooms. Please, don't hurt me. Enough of this. I'm alerting the authorities. I think twice about that. I always wish Lieb Industries would been held with higher standard .. than your single minded determination to maximize profits. I therefore have no alternative but to nominate myself as Executor of the Company. Mr. Elmwood, take a seat. So, gentlemen. Do we understand each other? What you been up to eh? - Who did you work for? - Piss off! The man ask you a question. If you don't answer, I'm going to fucking kill you. - I don't know. No one knows. - Bullshit! - Let's kill her. - Wait! Wait, you need me. There is a bomb in that car. Once we reach 20,000 feet, that bomb will engage and you'll have 20 minutes. - Jesus, we got big troubles. - Fuck yeah we do. - Hey, what's going on out there? - There's someone coming. Come here. Get over here. Hide. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm alright. - Are you sure? - I'm alright. It's okay. It's okay, sweety You don't think you'll get off the plane, do you? They're only 3 parachutes, do the math. Why's taking so long? It should have cleared by now. Check again. TRANSFER COMPLETE Got it. We're ready. Cohen, bring it down. I'm telling you the truth, there's a bomb in the cargo. and activated at 20,000 feet. You got 10 minutes to get off and this thing will blows. Sorry Otto. I got 10 million calling on the other line. How did you come up with that number? What are you talking about? That the exact amount we had to liquidate. How would you know that? For not someone from the inside, this... That's called, corporate repatriation. I must be on my way. Don't go anywhere. Liv and Sam are in the main cabin. You'll be safe there. We found a bomb on the plane. We're going to attempt to disarm it. We're going to take the plane back. Can you get into the cockpit? This what exactly the system build to prevent.

No, I think it's blue. Really? No, it's red. Yes! Otto, are you okay? Check him Bruce. I'll go check on him right now. Bruce! Bruce! Yeah? It's Ross. Bruce's state room is burning. We got to get this thing down. We're 10 minutes out. Get strap in. This may get bumpy. Right Let's get him up, let move him upstairs. How about Bruce? It's going to have to wait till we land. Are you okay? Alright buddy, come on. Here we go. - How is she? - Hanging in there. Better sit down, and hold on tight. Hey, stay with us, Otto. Stay with us, man. Gear down. - Flaps 13. - Give me another 10 degrees of flaps. Full flaps. BERMUDA INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE Hey, over here. Please, for Bruce. Upload everything video and electronics, to Max Porter in the Paris office, alright? Immediately. He'll know what to do with it. - Hey, sweetheart. - Hey .. They've room arranged for us here. Why don't you head over there and get some rest. I'm going to be here a bit. He will take you. - Okay. - Okay. Only if you promise, I'll see you soon. You better believe it. Now get out of here. - Thank you. - For what? Being you. I'll see you soon then. Sir, we finally got in. Not much to see. Holy shit! Hey, it's Max. You're not going to believe this. Yeah, I can say the same thing to you. So, what do you have? As of last week, both the CIA and MI6 intended on closing the case work on The Tribe. my MI6 counterpart, Joe Ballard and I were the only to believe the group is still real. The night before the flight, we were set up and he was killed. Yet you survived. I got lucky. Until my colleague and I found information.. that led me to Bruce Lieb's flight. There wee an interesting bundle of files which basically dossier on.. this Billionaire Bruce Lieb and his companies. I think he's the target. When Lieb refused to ground the plane. I had no intention to remain on board. Until I realized that my fiance was on that plane. - Look, you can't be on this flight. - Are you out of your mind? She just been hired by the Lieb's financial. That's work. I'd love to know on how you would feel about your thought about joining us to a more permanent basis? I'm working with a new clients and I just really wanted you to know. Agent Ross, please come to your point. My point is, he wanted me on that plane. I know this highly against protocol... But I would feel a lot more at ease that maybe you were to join us this flight. - Stay away from me. - Do we have a problem? Would you tell Lieb I'll accept his invitation. In fact, every single person is in the position ..to know of Lieb's activity, was on board that night. His half sister. His lawyer. He's CFO and his bodyguard. Two days ago, up in one of the dozen account we tracked with The Tribe holding company called IIU. Do you know what that amount equals? Lieb's financial was able to liquidate. Now who else would had known that precise figure? What better way for the leader of The Tribe to retain control remain anonymous, and salvage the assets he laundered to Lieb's financial. If those hijackers were to down that plane, Bruce Lieb would have pull off god damn coup. What exactly are you suggesting? My God. It's all that was left. Our leader is not dead. He got off the plane before it even left the ground. What are you intent on doing, Ross? I gonna find him and bring him in. Sub edited and resynced by: PEEAN91
