You don't really do medical claims. You really do medical claims? Yeah [Laughs] I really... I really do. What? Come on. No. I... No judgment. Okay, fine. Um... I used to want to... I used to want to be a professional kickboxer. I take classes now, but... Kickboxing? Lame. It's... That's amazing. The sport of the future. Okay, I need to just breathe, uh... Okay. For a second. I like you. You are such a perv. If I was having sex, do you really think I'd waste my time answering your phone call? Fine. You're the queen of hook-ups. He wasn't a douchebag. He was a gentleman. Oh, my God. You did not just say that. You... you know what? You're a whore. You're a gigantic whore. Well, I'm not like my slut friend, am I? Hello? I'm gonna go. And thanks. Bye. - Aah! - Aah! Stay there! Stay there. Who are you? My name's Sabrina. Whoa, whoa. Just stop! Where are we? I don't know. Whoa. Same thing happened to me. We're the same. - There's nothing. - What? There's nothing back there. That's the only way out. What? That's the only way out. - S-stay... stay there. - Okay. Hello?! Aah! No. No. Damn it. I'm sorry. What? Help! Help! She's trying to kill me! Damn it! Hey! Hey! Hey! Fuck. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Why are you doing this? Because we have to. Stop! Stop. Aaah! Stop. Aaaaaah! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! [ Crying ] Die! Die! Die! Aaaaaaaaah! How many more do I have to kill? Can you hear me?! Please let me in. Just stay where you are, Sabrina. Don't even think about it. - Time for your announcements. - I do love that part. Oh, Joseph. I do. Well, I love most of it. You know that. M-mm. It's a lot of work and stress, I know. I feel it, too. But it's all very worthwhile. M-mm. The replacements can be an irritant. That's all. And they are. Hopefully, we will not need another one. Well, if we do, we will make do, as we always have. - Indeed. - M-mm. M-mm. My love. I can't! Hello, my friends! Well, another seven fights have crescendoed. Ha ha! Ahh. Well, congratulations to those down below who have survived this day. You may rest easy knowing that your loved ones will also survive this day. Let's meet Patricia Johnson. She is survived by several others, most notably her parents, whom you see here. But because today you fought and won, Cody, Your mother will live to see another day. Ah, the pretty and independent Jamie Williams grew up in foster homes, Then worked in a supermarket while earning a business degree. Jamie was gathered to fight as a replacement for Jennifer brown, who, you see here, tried to chew her way through her obligations. She was survived by her aunt and Uncle. May they rest in peace. But you, Sabrina, because today you fought and won, your daughter will live one more day. All right. Let the games continue! You "d"? [ Speaks indistinctly ] Phoebe. Guess we both know what's expected, huh? You haven't fought yet? They said they'll kill my baby sister if I didn't fight. Her name is antina. She just got her degree. I put her through school. They said they'd kill my mother. It's not your fault. I know. Rah! Rah! Get the fuck off me! I fucking hate my mother. Sabrina? I knew no one could hurt you. I-I saw you. You look strong. Did you see me? You're the one who broke that woman's neck against the wall, right? No. How come you can fight like that? I watched him beat up my mom so many times. And I just... I couldn't watch it anymore. Facing the corner, hands on your head. Let me tell you something right now... I'm making it out of here. I don't give two shits what you have to say. Just shut your mouth and fucking stand back. The only question you have to ask is what your neighbor over here asked... "How many more do I have to kill?" Facing the corner, hands on your head. Don't you fucking eyeball me. It was a good first kill. You should be proud. Fuck you. You made me kill her. No, you had a choice. You chose to let your kid live another day. I'd say, "good choice." That's not my kid. Oh, no? I don't have a daughter. So, you won't mind if I put the kill order in, then... Since she's not your kid. If you think I give a fuck what you do with that kid, you are gravely mistaken. If you want to kill her be my guest. Don't you fuckin' eyeball me. You think just because you were a p.O.W., you can take me on?! Let me tell you something about me! I didn't crack. You must be hungry. Let's go! Single file! Let's go! No. No. No. No! Aaah! Aaah! No! - Move! - Aah! Let's go. Where are we going? Initiates, let's go. Get your ass up! Listen up. Your questions will be answered, your concerns addressed, so just sit tight and behave yourselves. His honor will speak beautifully, and you'll feel as if you can say anything you want. Don't. Just keep those pretty little mouths shut, and I do mean all of you, and before long, this whole thing will be over. Understand that? Yes, sir! - Understand that?! - Yes, sir! I wonder how many of you I get to kill. - Here we go. - Yeah, here we go. Just like the rest of you, I can kill a bitch. Unlike the rest of you I fucking love it. None of this makes any sense... none of it. Cry. Cry. Cry. We have to figure out what the reasoning is for this. If we can figure out the reasoning, then we could talk to them. Listen, we're all in the same... I'm not in the same anything... not with you. I shouldn't have listened to those people. I should have kept talking to him. If I had kept talking to him, he wouldn't have gone down in the box. Why did he go down in the box? Ooh-whee! Looks like someone's off her meds. Stop it! We need to find a way out! You know what? Good idea. You grab the keys, rain man over here can grab a gun, and "we're all in the same whatever" can call the cops. Sound good? She's trying to intimidate you. Damn. You're both gonna be fun to wax. - If you lost them all. - Are you saying you're gonna kill me? I'm saying you sound scared. - I sound scared? - Yeah. Really? "How many more do I have to kill?" Ah, boo-fucking-hoo. Fuck you. We all heard you screaming like a little girl. I'm scared? Really? I'm scared? Cody's right. We have to find a way out. It's not that simple. We're probably being monitored right now... every word, every move. Greetings, Victors. We have goaded the initiates from their homes in frenzy. We lead our maenads into battle with one another, beast within every maenad made wild by the frenzy. Make the whole earth... Thunder with your rhythm, with thundering shouts and screams, tearing creatures limb from limb with their bare hands. Initiates... Fighters. Ladies, please forgive the semantics. We tend to get a bit excited during these times. M-mm. M-mm. Ff the 50 that we've gathered, fewer than half of you remain, and we like to bring you here, six at a time, intimately, to behold you. I know how it feels to be where you are... the rush of fear, the helplessness. You don't have to be helpless. That's all over now. Oh, look, sweetie. Wasn't she your pick? Indeed, she was... and is. M-mm. And my favorite's here, too. And how you won... feigning surrender only to betray her. I cherish the devious fighters. To be a woman, you have to be devious in this world. I agree. I still prefer Phoebe, however, for all of her bar fights and jail time, setting fire to the tails of dogs. M-mm. And, of course, I can understand wanting to try, but no one's ever escaped, I'm afraid. My husband has run this organization for a long time. For thousands of years. And his father ran the organization before him and his father before him, et cetera, et cetera. But make no mistake. This is not about me or my bloodline. This is about you... each of you. Remember the first time he talked about the maenads. Between us, I thought he was crazy. But he wasn't crazy. He sees who we are... all of us women. He sees the power we have inside. And the maenads... the maenads were the first truly empowered women. They left the shackles of polite society, freed themselves of all control... hunting down animals and humans, reveling in the blood. They were so special. Is that what this is all about? If we win enough fights, we get to join your organization? Join our organization? Huh. That's food for thought. There are 22 of you left, and the one that sees this room again will be the one that's brought to us as champion in three days' time. And that champion will be released, reintegrated into society, transformed. Search yourselves for the strength you carry within you. Here is where you will manifest all that you are. And that, ladies, is why you're with us. And that is the secret to your survival. Look deeply within. Find what's worth fighting for. Hey, sunshine. Listen... We got off on the wrong foot, huh? I was inspired by the way you killed that bitch who didn't even know she had to fight. Let's see how well you do with someone who's expecting it, huh? I like your story. I got a story, too. No shit. I was raised in foster homes by sick motherfuckin' rapists who'd rather stick their cocks in girls than give us dinner. Girls like that whore kid you got. Hey! - I'll fucking kill you! - Hey! Hey! I want your fucking kid dead! Move! Move! Move! - Please let me get... - Jesus. Baby. Baby. Let me help you, please. Hey, Sabrina. You military? Yeah. I was. You were a prisoner of war? You escaped? What good does that do us? Why? Hey. Hey. Are you okay? I have to get out. I know we can do this. - All we'd have to do is... - Is what? Kill those motherfuckers. Plus those other two guys and... and that other guard. That's eight, plus the man and the woman... and then the guys who brought them food, so 12? I mean, she's right. We can... we can do this. Don't you see what they're capable of? Who's recording Megan? I gave her up for adoption 13 years ago. I haven't the slightest idea where she is. I didn't even know her name. And these people have a camera in her fucking bedroom. So... so, what, then? We just... we keep killing until we die and then my mom dies anyways? Sabrina? Look, if we could all just get together and get guns... All six of us were together, and none of us got guns. - We need a plan! - We need a better plan than the impossible! Baby, I'm coming. Aaah! Sabrina... What? I'm sorry for yelling at you. What if we have to fight each other? Sabrina! Cody. Come on, Cody. Stop! Hit her, Cody. Come on! - Get away. Get off. - No! Aaaaaah! Go, Cody. Fight back. Aaah! Aaah! Get her off you! Good girl. Good girl. That's it. Yes. Yes. Fight it. Push your hips out. Cody, push your hips out. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze, baby, squeeze. Come on. Come on. Aaaaah! Hold it, Cody. Hold it. That's it. Okay. - Sabrina, no! - Cody, let her go. - No! - She'll be back. Don't worry. Hi. Ugh! I heard about your daughter... your daughter I have a fianc. We're getting married in a month She just fought! - We need more time! - She's not ready to fight again! I can't fight. Let's go, Sabrina. Think about your baby girl. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Good girl. Aaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Sabrina. Sabrina. Megan? I was gonna call you "Samantha." I liked the name "Sam." I never knew my father. Mom always said I was better off, but... I just always wanted to ask him... "Why, daddy?" If you could hear me. There's nothing about me that would make a good mother. I'm flawed. I'm very flawed. I was broken, you know? Oh, you were perfect. I carried you. I carried you every day, Samantha. And now you may never know. Teresa! Yes? Is she dead? I can't believe this! Let my mother go! Let my mother go! I don't care if I live anymore! I want to go home. Cody, listen to me. The people you love could be taken away from you like that. Don't fight for your mother. Fight for yourself. Tell Matty that I love him very much... And I'm so sorry. Come on, Brenda. The sign said, "no spitting." - Excuse me, ma'am. - Yeah? It's kurtz. - Excuse me. - Oh, no, Joseph. Let me handle it. Can you excuse me a minute? - Sure. - Thanks. No! No! N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! Oh, no! No! Yes, ma'am. - Stay down. - Yes, ma'am. All right. She's coming down. - Hey. - Stay down. Back to your cell. Stay down. Move it! Ahh! Ohh! Ahh! Ahh! - Sorry to disturb you. - No, no, please. That's what I'm here for, William... here to help. Oh, poor Brenda. Can we let her up? Brenda, dear, can we discuss this? Listen to me. This is very important, okay? I want you to look at your mother on the screen. Go on. Look at your mama. Go ahead. Can we get some water or a cold compress or something, please? I'm here to help you. I'm gonna help you, okay? Breathe. Good. Okay? Back with us now? Okay. Okay, listen... Brenda, we're gonna try this one more time. I want you to look at the screen with your mother. Look at your mama. Brenda, the only way you're gonna be able to save your loved ones... is for you to go down there and fight. It's just the way it has to be. - Are you okay? - Ohh. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I... She's not salvageable. Poor thing. Brenda! Ugh! No, no, no. Now we have to find a new replacement. Poor Joseph. Please. Please. - It's okay. - My daughter. Cody? Teresa? What do you think they'd do if we just.. Refused to fight? Come down and kill us both. Kill our families. How's your mother? What? Your mother. Don't talk about my mother. I saw what you did to that woman. Fight for yourself, right? Right? You know... when I first met my husband, Jason... we were at this party, and he, um... and he said he wanted to dance with a girl who had twizzlers for hair. He's been on ventilation in I.C.U. For months. If he dies now, it would probably be a blessing for him. How's your mother? Her health is good? Yeah. She loves you? She needs you? Yeah. And you need her. - You're... - Shut up! Squeeze. Squeeze. Go on. Squeeze. Squeeze. Go on. Why? Sabrina! Atten-hut! You're dead. You're dead. You... you're definitely dead. Just come a little closer. Please, just come a little closer. Fuck. I'll fuck you up! You're not gonna even get to say goodbye. Just come a little bit closer, Please. Just come a little... - Fight or die, right? - Don't you fucking touch her! Okay. Hey, there. Just wanted to talk. Thought you made it down here. All right. You can do this, Cody, okay? I just came down here to tell you how... Impressed I've been, seeing you kill all these girls, even your black friend. Saw her on the way in. Parents would be proud... Except maybe your father. Heard your story through the walls... his big, greasy hands all over your mother. I would have done the same thing. Did he, uh, touch, you, too? Stop! He did, didn't he? Tell me, how'd you do it, huh? You stab him, push him down the stairs? Don't! Gun? No, no, no, no, no, no. You poisoned him, didn't you? Yeah. That's what I would have done. Your story's the same. You're just like me now. This one's for you, Sabrina! Where you going, sweetheart? Huh? I'm not done with you yet. I knew you'd be easy. But, fuck, I didn't know it'd be this easy. Kind of sad your friend gave her life... huh? Just so you could die seconds later. What a waste. Aah! Let's try that again. Get up, Cody. I know you can't hear me, Sabrina, but you've got to understand, I do it all out of rspect. Fuck it. I want to fight. I want to fight. I want to fight! You hear me?! I hate to end the party, sweetheart... but I'm ready for the main event. I want Sabrina! s Stay there. I'll be right with you. Do you hear me, you fucking assholes?! I really want to fight! Are you gonna let me fight?! - I want to fight. - Yeah, I heard. Listen, no one here wants you to fight more than I do. All right, I guess you've earned it. But first you have to give up the pen. You really think you're the first person that would try the pen trick? All right. Good girl. I want to fight. You can fight all you want. We're gonna kill your kid anyway. Aaaaaaaah! You want her? You got her. Aah! Come on. Come on! Come on, bitch. Aaah! Aaaaah! Aaaaah! Aaah! Aww. You think you're done? The replacement. Well, lucky you. You get to kill them both. Over to the far wall. Well, hello, friends. Yes, the time has finally come. We approach culmination. And what a week it has been. But before we begin, Let us look at an initiate who could be the daughter of sacmus herself. The violence that she has endured, the violence that she has suffered... Come on. Sabrina, the one to watch. Come on in. Who could have expected the sheer efficiency of her most recent kill? It is to be respected, to be honored. Let us guide Sabrina into her final battle, facing one whom we have freshly reaped. Yes, a replacement. Now, it's true a final fight against a newly plucked initiative is unprecedented, but... no more unprecedented than the worthiness of this new adversary... Isabelle Thomas, a former collegiate athlete who earned a full athletic scholarship to Northwestern. Now she spends her time operating a gym that she owns with her husband and trains in with her husband and trains in Brazilian jiujitsu. Exciting. The Victor of this singular contest... will be our champion! I'm Sabrina. I figured. Where are we? It doesn't matter. Do you understand why they have us here? Do you have any children? No. Then I'm really sorry they have your husband. That's how they make us fight. If you don't fight, they'll kill him. If you lose, they'll kill him. Who are you fighting for? My daughter. I'm fighting for my daughter! So, we have to fight. We have to fight. How do I know you're not lying to me? Look around you. What other choice do you have? Come on. Fight! Come on. Ooh. Huh. That was a good one. That was good. You can do this. Come on. - You got to do it. - Fuck you. - Yeah, that's good. - Fuck you. Listen. Listen. Ladies and gentlemen, behold! All right. Okay. Listen to me. You don't have to do this. - It's crazy. - Yeah, it's crazy. But we don't have a choice, all right? You have to fight. You have to fight! That's it. Do it. Do it! Do it! Aaaaaaaaaah! Ha! Ha! Ha! Astonishing! Now, in all our years, the most unexpected culmination so far. To watch her, I could have sworn Sabrina would be our champion, but her exceptional violence was defeated by an ever greater violence. I-I'm sorry, my dear, but it appears that both of our favorites have lost. What a year. Congratulations to the champion. And now my beautiful wife and I are going to go meet and greet our champion. Oh, uh, I think you owe me something. That girl's dead. - You got lucky. - Yeah. Son of a bitch. - What was that? - I said, "go fuck yourself." William... We want to thank you for the enthusiasm you add to our efforts. - You have well earned your time to relax. - And you're like family to us. Sir. Ma'am. Oh, enough with the formalities. Go join the fun. I'm sure some of our guests would love to hear your stories. Need to count this? I trust you. What a douche. 700 bucks. Fucking losing it to that twit. Fucking shrimp. Clean you up. Yeah, I'll fucking take good care of you... clean you real good. Nice little band-aid. Thanks for nothing. - You're welcome. - Aah! Ohh! Aah! Hey. Fat fuck. You got me again. That was a good one. You owe me 5 bucks. As an aussie, I'm just glad that fucking kiwi's dead. That fucking kiwi's dead. She's... Deathless by nature, destroyed, demolished, razed to the ground buried by woman to the flesh of woman's sacrifice. But I-I hope you don't mind my saying... It was a great surprise. I'm glad you like surprises. We have waited the seven days for the one who would most successfully epitomize the purest image of female prowess. What we are capable of as a species. We will clean you, dress you, introduce you to our society, no no longer an initiate but longer an initiate but changed... dare I say it?... Transformed. A true maenad. - I'm sorry I'm so late. - I know. I'm just glad you're here. - Look out! - Aaaaaaaah! How are you? You all right? - You all right? - Yeah, yeah. - Joseph. - Darling. Oh, shit. How can you be a part of this? You're a woman! Exactly. Aaaaaaaaaah! Aah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! My wife! My love! Elizabeth. It may please you to know... That once you're dead, I will allow your daughter to live. Uh-huh. I hope you feel a deep motherly pride, because you fought so well... We'll provide your daughter the opportunity to fight, too, just just like you... just like you. Perhaps she can possess the tenacity to become champion. Aaaaaaaaaah! What?! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ugh! You were wrong. You did crack. - You really do medical claims? - Yeah. Stop! Stop! I'm sorry. I'm fighting for my daughter!
