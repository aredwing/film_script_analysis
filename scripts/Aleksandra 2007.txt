Where's the station? My train's due. Take the bag! Hurry up. Is it near? I can hear a train. Playing hooky? Slow down. Where are we? Is it this way? OK, let's go. -Walk slowly. - OK, OK. Can you see him? Let's go. Damn... - Who is it? -Take it easy. This armored train's yours. Armored train? Sounds good, "armored train"! -You being funny? - No! - She's in the front car. -The one with the ladder. There! He's forgotten us, hasn't he? The captain there? -Yes, him. - Sure. - It's here. -Where are you going? I'll handle it. She's got an invitation. - C'mon, Sergeant... - Wait a minute! She's got all her papers! Let her get on! - Give the paper back! - C'mon! There you go! Help her! Don't push me! My pass? Thanks. It's the 3rd stop. Go all the way. It'll be nighttime. Have they gone? Where did they find you? - Are you in pain? - No, I'm OK. Hello. Hello. Aliochkin! Over there! C'mon, get a move on, will ya? OK! Hold the door. Take your helmets off. You can't sleep here. Let her through. Don't look so downcast. Cheer up, soldier. Oh, my God... Stop staring at her. Get some rest. Stand up! Get ready to get off! Get a move on! Who's sleeping? Is everyone awake? Get out in a line! Line up alongside the car! Alexandra Nikolaevna! Coming. - Alexandra Nikolaevna! - Yes... - Alexandra Nikolaevna! - I'm here. Here! Major Mazour! Hello. But where's Denis? His squadron will be back tonight. -What'll I do, then? -Well, we'll... - We'll what? - Sit here! - Where? - Sit down here. - C'mon! - Whatever next! It's filthy. - Hurry up! - Are you insane? You can wash your clothes. Don't be scared. Don't pull me. Here I come... Don't pull my legs! Easy does it... Good grief, be careful! OK, I've got her! One, two! There! My God, it's stifling! -Where are you going? - The 46th. A soldier's going, too. Take him with you. Take the bag. Take it! Go on, move! When are we going? Let's go. Here's our vehicle. That thing? -Why did you wake him up? - Let's go! Give me your hand! I'll hold you! - Now what? - Grab her. - Do I worm my way in? -That's right. Here goes... Go on. We'll follow you. Good... This way. Careful now... It'll be a nice memory for you. Lean on the side. OK, let's go! -We're nearly there. - So I see. The lights over there... Left, left... Don't brake so hard. - Here we are. -We'll help you. Up you get. Straighten up. You get down. Your hand... That's it, come to me... Careful! Stand there, just in case. This way. - Now jump. - What? I'll catch you. Put your foot on the wheel. - He'll catch you! - Sure! Don't shout! So, are we cool? We're cool! Let's go... Help our guest! He is helping me! Keep going... Follow me. Valera! So, did they bring her? She's here! Don't stay there! OK, see you! OK, keep going... Lift your feet up here. There we are... Keep going... Alexandra Nikolaevna... Your "hotel". - Are we here? - Go ahead. Is this it? Go on, you go in first. As you wish. There you are, Alexandra Nikolaevna. Make yourself at home. Go on! - Put that there! - No, here! Hurry up! That's fine. Sir... OK, OK! Don't stay here. Go! Goodnight... Here! Let her sleep. Let's go. It's so noisy! It's hot already. What time is it? You'll drop me! Denis! My little Denis! I haven't seen you in such a long time! -Why are you all dirty? - I sure am dirty. Just look at you! You're all sweaty! Where are your manners? And your uniform's worn out! We'll wash it! But later, Grandma, later. Get dressed. I'll go freshen up. Then, I'll show you the wash area. You forgot your towel. - Give it to me. - Here. It's so hot! What's the temperature? It must be over 100 degrees. You promised me you'd show me your men. -There you are. - "There" what? And don't make that face! No grimacing! I'm the one who should be grimacing. Here's where we clean the guns. Each time they're used, we clean them so they don't get clogged up. - Each time? - Yes. Of course... - Rub it harder. - I'm rubbing... Why's the oil dirty? - So, the cloth's dirty, too? - Yeah. Does this really interest you? Come on. -Wait, I want to watch. -Take your time. It's important to me. Is she looking for someone or what? - How old are you? - 20. You're really 20? Go on, keep rubbing! My hands won't obey me. Got a phone? The firing pin is in wrong. The breech won't go in. Don't look, these are old guns. Why? That's just how it is. Look, they aren't your men. Right. Let's go! Let's go, you're hot. - Let's go see something else. - OK. Turn right toward the tent. Careful where you walk. I am being careful... OK, let's go. Is the grub coming? They're waiting for their food. Come see a tank. It's more interesting. Let's go. The men go out in it. Captain! Can I help you? - Hi. You OK?. - Hello. This is my grandmother who's visiting. I'll show her our combat vehicles. - Fine vehicle, isn't she? - Just back from an exercise. - Want to see inside? - Let's go. Put your foot on the trap door. - Where's the crew? - Sleeping. Bring me a Kalashnikov. - Where do you sit? - It's not very comfortable. - Sit down. - It's hot. It smells. It's the guns, the iron, the men. You'll get used to it. It's terrible. That's the driver's seat. How many people fit in? Ten or more. Must be a tight fit... Are you tired? Certainly not. Here, Captain! Give it to me. I'll stay here. You're not scared? Why should I be? Let me see. - Give it here! - Not too heavy? Let me try it. Hold it against your shoulder. Look up. Down, like that... Load it. There... Like that... That's good. It's so easy. Well done. Come on, I'll show you something else. Come on, Grandma. Turn around. Good. Don't pull my arm! You'll rip it out of its socket! Well done. - Careful. - Stand straight. Mazour, take the gun! Yes, sir! Well? It's great! - I'm tired. And my legs... - Same here. - Are you sleepy? - Always. Then, get into bed. - No, I'll go back. - Really? If not, I'll make a noise, tossing and turning in bed. And I'll say horrible things in my sleep. Well, go getwashed... If you can find the shower! You don't look after your body. You're strong and brave, but you're letting yourself go. You look like a peasant, not an officer. Maybe I'm not... Maybe I would be more of one if I hadn't shot so many people. It doesn't make me more ardent or proud. I don't believe you. And you're not the only one to shoot people. A man down isn't necessarily dead. And you take after me, you're strong. That's not the most important thing for a man. But I only understood that lately. I didn't understand your grandfather. He'd stopped loving strong people. It's complicated for a soldier. -Where are you going? - Especially a Russian. Let's talk a while. This'll make the others happy! - Discussion over. - Go to bed! OK, OK. Go to bed. I'm going, too. What's that? Good Lord, what's that? Well, I'm not going to stay here. Not everybody's sleeping. There's movement. Let's not get lost. Looking for someone? Can I help you? Goodnight. OK, thanks. I can't reach my wife. She's really depressed. Where am I going? I can't see a soul. Have they all gone or what? Halt! Who goes there? Who are you going to see? -You, clearly. -Why me? Wait! Where's she from? Look in the bag! - What now? - I'll just have a look. - Go ahead. -Who are you going to see? There's something soft, Andrey. I want to sit down for a while. Get off me. Get off me, I said! I'm going through, anyway! It stinks of dog in there! It always smells of something here! I'm getting used to it... Where's the dog? There hasn't been one for ages! You're not allowed to be here. I'm not asking your opinion. Do you hear? What is it? Keep quiet. Don't say anything. "Keep quiet." You're not hypnotizing him, are you?!. Sit up straight. You're a bit silly, you are... Stop it! What are you looking at? Why are you staring at me? It's my duty. It's his duty. Absolutely. Yeah, sure... Soldier, what are you doing? I can do it, too! - Stop playing with your weapon! - Sania, look! Do you hear me? It hurts my arms... - Do you have anything to eat? - Sure. Just let me find it for you. Do you like meat pie? - I want one, too! - Here. Thank you. - What's in them? - A bit of everything: meat... Hungry, weren't you? Is it tasty? Good. Where are you going? Sania, look! There's nowhere to go... You were hungry... Are you badly fed? We're very well fed. The enemy... never sleeps. Aren't you scared? - And you? - I am. Do you get homesick? - No. - No? I thought you were from here. I thought I was dead. Then, I realized you weren't. - I wasn't going to kill you? - No. I'm not homesick. Back home in Russia, the women are mean. Why are they mean? You watch too much TV. The women are glued to it. And they envy the people on TV. They just think of money, right? What else? Well, the Fatherland! - What Fatherland? - What? This Fatherland? What Fatherland? Boys, boys... I'm tired. We need to rest. I'm going to sit down. It's dirty! It doesn't matter. The stool is old. Never mind. You can't stay on that stool! -You're gonna fall over, Grandma! - No, I won't... Grandad! Sania, go back to your sentry box. Back to your post. Great! I'm going. Keep an eye on her. Go on. Virgin Mary, save us, poor sinners... Open the gate! Go on! Hold it back! I'll go back. - Take care. -Thank you. Alexandra Nikolaevna! - Is that right? - Quite right. Why are you wandering around? - Are you properly settled in? -Yes, just fine. I'm walking around, talking to the soldiers... -What do they tell you? - Don't worry, they don't complain. Last night, you were in the minefield. Please come into my office. This way.Through here. Don't get up. Come on in! Stay there. Don't get up. - Let them sleep. - Move your socks. Leave them be. It's stifling in here. They were clearing mines. They should have a wash! Is there no other place to sit down? Keep going. Usually, there's almost no-one here. It's my fault. - It's hot. - Come over here. -Who are you? -The unit commander. Let's go. - You can sit here. - Here? Well, alright. - What's this? -The men's wash area. Really? - Is my Denis in your unit? - Kazakov? Yes. It's usually girls who come to visit him. He asked me to allow you to come. I accepted. - Did you ask questions? - Yes. People like you no longer visit. What was worrying you? You've been fighting for so long... You're used to it now. Do you enjoy it? It's not right... Denis is a professional soldier. And it's his income. He's one of the best in the division. And he has the best scouts. It's almost war here. To become like him, you have to fight in the field. I'm sick of this military pride. You can destroy! When will you learn to rebuild? Take my Denis: If nothing happens to him and he stays alive... he'll be discharged. But shooting is the only thing he knows how to do. What do you actually want? I don't understand you. Where's my hotel? Your "hotel"!... Straight ahead over there. Over there... Give me your arm. Walk alongside the stockade. It's straight ahead over there... - On the right. - Over there? See the armored vehicle? It's over there. Bang it in! Look, like this! The nails are rusty. You're caught! I've got you! I recognized you! You never stay still! -Why didn't you sleep? -Where are you going? I've got something to do. I'll be back tonight. Get some sleep. Have a rest. - Promise you'll sleep? - I promise. I don't believe you! Go on, Grandma. I don't have time!... To your posts! Be careful. Go, go! Look after yourself! What are you doing here? -What's your name? - Andrey. Well? I have to stay with you and feed you. Sure... Don't you remember me? I'm not hungry right now. When I get hungry tonight, I'll find you. Till then, you're free. That's not possible. How so? Not possible? I said you're free. Run along! Alexandra Nikolaevna... I said, run along! Go on! Alexandra Nikolaevna! I don't like people watching me. Run along! Good Lord... I'll put my jacket on. My scarf. What else? Nothing. - Where's the exit? - Answer her. - Over there, on the right. - OK. Lift it up! What're you waiting for? - Where's the market? - Are you allowed out? - I need to go to the market. -That way. - Go to the station... - Not all at once! - Left. - Left? - We're not allowed to. -Why not? - Buy us some cigarettes. - What else? Cookies. It's just... - Just what? - We don't have any money. We really don't. Oh, you... Cross the tracks: there's no train. OK, OK. Near the station. I remember now. Thanks, lads. We don't have any money on us. - Don't jostle me. - You did! -The market? - Over there. - Over there? - Yes. OK... Here we are. How much? How much is it? #Why won't you answer?# #It's not for sale?# This shapka's lovely. Buy it. Thank you. - I'd like to. - Call in again. Buy something off me. Well, really! - Men's clothes... - Mom! - I don't need any. - Leave her alone. My God! I'd almost convinced her! How much are these cigarettes? Are they for soldiers or officers? - Soldiers. - Mercenaries? Draftees. I didn't bring my money! I'm sorry. -Tomorrow? - Tomorrow. Of course. Are you alright? Sit down. I'd love to. Stay a while. I'm tired. Have a rest. Are you in pain? Yes, all over. I'm tired. What do you want? - Cream. - What kind? Face cream. What for? - Cream? - Yes. - What for? - Nothing. -Where are you from? - Stavropol. -To see someone? - My grandson. - How old is he? - 27. He's an officer. What does he do? No idea. Did something happen to him? No, I missed him. I live on my own. What's your name? Malika. I'm Alexandra Nikolaevna. It's stifling. -The heat! - We're used to it. When we look at the Russian soldiers... They seem tiny. Just boys... Even if they smell like men... They look like kids. The Slavs really are different. And there are so many ofyou... Yes, but we don't understand what happens inside, we get muddled. Always looking for something... Keep looking. Who does he belong to? Your young folk are angry. There are all kinds. He was nice when he was little. He's totally changed. He does what he likes now. I'm afraid they'll all get like that. No-one's buying. That's true. -What are you doing? - Putting this away. You speak good Russian. - I know. All the opportunities in my life were in Russia. I was a teacher. You're so tired. Give me that bag. Yes, that one. - Give me the jacket. -There you are. Let's see what you need. - Cigarettes and 4 cookies... - Take them. I live nearby. Come and have a rest at my place. Here's Zoulai! If anyone wants anything, sell it to them and take the money. I'm hot. Let's go home. I live in an old building. It's stifling. I hardly slept. -What about your stall? - It's alright. They sell cigarettes here, too, but they're expensive. Not very far now. The men just stand there, chatting! Come on, don't worry. This way. Help my guest! I'm alright. Straight ahead. Second floor. Careful on the stairs.Turn left. Come in. Sit wherever you like. I'll go get changed. I made it at last. You can lie down if you want. Thank you. Make yourself comfortable. You must be hot in your jacket. My God, can we, at our age... start over? It's a bit late. Yes... My leg hurts. What about your stall? A friend and the neighbor will keep an eye on it. - You saw Zoulai. - Oh yes, you told me. That'll be OK. It's boiling already. Lie down. It's incredible how hot it is. This heat is stifling. I won't ask any questions, I understand that you're all alone. Why "all alone"? - Lie down. -Thank you. Let's start with painful matters... Your shoes... Oh, bliss! -The pillow. - I have an apartment, flowers... Is your head alright? My husband died 2 years ago. It was hard, living with him. He was cruel, he shouted all the time. Now I'm free, I lead a quiet life. I've stopped living for others. -The tea's not good. - It smells good. - What flavor is it? - Flavor! This tea's foul! When the officers barter it, it's very different. Do they barter much? They barter everything: uniforms, coats with epaulettes and medals... They're young. You've finished. Give me your bowl. A little more? I told you it was bad. What a fool I am! Coming on this journey, with my legs! Have you got brothers and sisters? A very old brother. The youngest was killed, as were 2 of my sisters. My youngest sister is in the mountains with her son. I haven't heard from her in over a year. You're so good to me. "Good"... Why be bad? Men can be enemies, but we're like sisters straightaway. Do you think it's so simple? I think I lived like that not very long ago. Everything's been destroyed here. Not just the houses. Life has been turned upside down. Good guys collude with bad guys, saints believe devils. They say fine words. They lie all the time... Pay no attention. Ours is a happy people. We like to laugh. I'd like you to see my home... Don't worry, Alexandra. - We don't abandon old folks here. - I know. I'll always have a roof. Well, I better head off. I promised I'd bring back cigarettes and cookies. -What are you looking for? - My bag. -There it is. - I forgot! Wait, I'll go get the boy next door. What for? -To take you back. -There's no need. That's how it is. Wait just a second. - Really... - Be right back. I nearly forgot my jacket. Zoulai! Are you back? My God... I have a guest. Is llyas home? He has to take Alexandra back to the camp. Hello. Hello. Come in here. Alexandra... This is the boy next door. He knows a short cut. Alright, let's go. How can you live here? It's bearable in summer. We're used to it. Give me your hand. Not too fast. The steps are steep. Thank you. #Be seeing you.# Take care of yourself, dear lady. Goodbye. Wait, don't go too fast. Look where you walk. #Up you go.# #Let's go inside.# Some short cut! Where on earth are we going? It's the quickest way. Let's carry on, then. - Have you ever traveled? - No. Where'd you like to go? To see Mecca... And to your Saint Petersburg. I'll leave you to get to Mecca. But I can help you get to Saint Petersburg. What are you thinking about? I know it's not up to you, but give us our freedom. We're tired and we won't last forever. Who's "we"? My boy... If only it was so simple! There are limits to one's patience. An old Japanese woman once said to me what you should ask God for, first. "Ask for intelligence," she told me. Strength doesn't lie in weapons or in one's hands. Let's go. You want freedom... If I had your freedom... I can see your camp. How about that! -Where did you get to? - Hello. I missed a meal. Here I am. It's dinnertime! Yes, let's have dinner. You haven't eaten? It must be cold by now... Let's go. Evening. - Andrey. - llyas. Raise the barrier. I'm tired. I got what you asked for. That's for you. Thank you very much. For you. There's this, too... What about me? Where did you come from? I didn't see you. Ask your pals. - I was here. - Don't lie. Lift it up! - Goodbye, llyas... Thank you. - Let's go. There was no need to buy all that. It's never-ending. Let's go. That way? Alright. Because of you, all day, the officers... Where's the captain? In your tent. He must be furious: He's been taking it out on me. Go away! Watch it! Alexandra Nikolaevna. -What are they doing? - Drying their clothes. Watch your step. What're you doing here? Let's go on. What's going on? Where's the table? Over here. Over here? Alright. - Where's the table? - What table? Where's the guard? Guard! -Who are you? - Private Katounov. What's going on? Where's the table? And dinner? OK, get the table and put it there. - It'll be ready soon. - Good. Hurry up. It should have been ready ages ago. - What's for dinner? - What's left. What do you mean? -Well, what? - You'll see. Can't see a thing! Turn the light on! Anton! What? Anton, hurry up and serve us. It's cold now. - Got the bread? - And the salad? Don't push me! - I've got the flowers! - What flowers? Thanks for not eating everything. It's cold. Come on... it's for her. It's perfect. Buckwheat, salad... Flowers... Herb tea... Thank you. I'm not hungry, but I'll have a bite. I'll try what they give you. Buckwheat with meat... He's a good cook. He's from the Urals. Why are you looking at me? Sania, go get some water! Leave me alone! I'm done. Thank you. Let's go. Do you know the way? I'll find it. - Finished? - I'm going back. I know where it is. Pull the table back. Move! You're sure you remember? We'll take you back. I'm going that way. - You remember? - I told you I did! - I'm going that way! - No, not that way. - No? -The next one. That way? I know that. That way. - I know. -Why say the opposite? I didn't ask you. I'm going that way, period. No, it's this way. Go away. - Go away. - Goodnight. Let's eat, Katounov. Let's go. Eat? Let's go. You'll make us dinner, right? I've already eaten. I'm back. Your hand! What's wrong with it? I taught a soldier a lesson. - What for? - He disobeyed. Sit up. Do you think you were right? Yes, we'll kick him out and I don't care what happens to him. But that's arbitrary. It's punishable by prison. He got a good hiding. He can't even answer back. - Move over. - He can do the same to me. - And the result? - A draw. Do you often organize fights like that? I won't say. Where were you today? We did a search. Nearby, in town. Did you kill anyone? People around here don't like you. That's nothing. But we're not feared! What good is the army if we're not feared! -You left the camp. - Yes. What for? - I won't say. -Why not? Don't talk to me like that! I'm not one of your army pals! You can't just do what you like! You haven't seen me in 7 years and you're yelling at me! -Why won't you get married? - I won't say. -Why? - Out of respect for you. - Out of respect? - Yes. Out of respect, Alexandra Nikolaevna. Ever since I was little, I remember that at home, everyone toed the line: you obeyed Grandpa, my mother obeyed you... It seemed normal. But even as a kid, I felt oppressed by it. Not to mention your daughter... My mother. She was clearly ashamed of your lack of tact, yours and Grandpa's. I can do without affection, but your daughter still can't. Are you sure that your descendants should satisfy your every whim. Are you? But only part of our selves is tied to you. We're people in our own right. You don't know what our life's like! Can you imagine a Caucasian son or grandson telling his mother he's a person in his own right and isn't tied to her? No problem. I know them well. Maybe, but I think you're wrong. A Caucasian can only do that in exceptional circumstances. Whereas the Russians abandon you for nothing or out of weakness. You go too far! You're right about the affection. I'm guilty. But I'll ask God for forgiveness. Not you. Try, it won't belittle you. I don't know where to start or where to stop. Women always bear every burden. Without leaving any for anyone else. Don't! They're too heavy! - Do you want some? - Why not? Turn the light on. Today I went to a woman's place. A local woman... She was very kind. I didn't dare to ask her why they confine people in pits. How can you kidnap other people? - What's that? -This? A shell case used as an ashtray. Stop it! Maybe she has nothing to do with all that. - It's in the genes. - Drink some tea. Only the genes can lead to that. Want some tea? Genes, genes... I know them very well.The answer... Their answer, if there is one, will be very pretty. You'd be surprised. They should be kept in pits. I didn't get that. But I freed one of those slaves. I thought that the guard would be a hairy beast with big ears. Know who it was? - Who? - A very handsome old man. I wanted him to be tried, but the women in the village screamed. They have terrible black eyes, husky voices, and they drool... Stop talking nonsense! I swear... The war veteran's jacket and medals stopped me in my tracks. When are you getting married? Do you take me for an idiot? You're nothing like Dostoevsky's! I turn the heads of girls I meet. But not marriage... Why not? I'm poor. Haven't you got savings? - Do you know how much? - How much? Forget it. We share a tent with an officer. He's divorced. I've seen the border guards. All divorced. There are thousands of us. Soldiers like to generalize. Oh, you... - What's that? -Where are you going? Why is the door always open? It's hot and there's only you here. -The mirror? - There. - Where? -There! What a character! Tell me what you're reading. - What? -What are you reading? Nothing. Do you watch films? - Shall I tell you which ones? - No need. Leave it. -Yes, Captain. - I'll do it. -The mirror's dirty. -Then, clean it. -Where do you do your washing? -What a question! Answer me. Hold still! Where are you going? I just want to sit down. -Where are you going? - Stop it! I'm sitting down. We wash our socks and underwear. We have a bowl. The rest - trousers and tunic - go in the machine. There's a washing machine. At the quartermaster's. You're very beautiful. Here we go again. Don't look at me like that. I understand why you're asking me all these questions. A soldier needs ceremony. Rituals if you like. We need to feel we're being well looked after. The uniform must be sturdy. Made of good material. I might croak in that tunic. My blood will flow on its stitches. It will soak up my piss, my sweat... - Honey... - Sorry. We men aren't tidy. We drag our sorry asses around. So, then I stand up straight. I tighten my belt. I hide my eyes under a fine cap. All around me are guys like me, with their dog tags around their necks which say who you are, where you're going and why. I'm getting carried away. No... You're right. I really miss you, you know. I think my life is coming to an end. I want to live. My body has grown old. But my soul can still live another lifetime. I love you. I want to have someone by my side. I'm no good on my own. Hey... You smell so good. You smell good, the way men sometimes smell. Women are all the same. Because all men are wonderful. Get washed, then come back to bed here. Don't wake your neighbor up. Alright. I'll braid your hair first. You used to do it when you were little. Wake up, Grandma, wake up! Come on, wake up! I'm going away for 5 days. You should go home. Come to the checkpoint. What checkpoint? The one you went through when you ran off. Wake up. Fall in! Follow me! Come on! Serguey! What's all the fuss about? OK, come on... - Hello. - Hello. Grandma... Hello again. You're so handsome... I'm going to find you a wife very soon. You're my only hope. You're so handsome, my darling. Do you remember? It's for you. Drive on! C'mon, c'mon! Hurry up! - Malika! -What is it, Zoulai? Well? I'm here. Ah, it's her! - I owe you money. - No, Alexandra. "No"? I don't want it. Put it away. We'll come with you. OK... I'll take your bag. Come on, we're going to be late. The train won't wait. So, we agree? You've got my address. Come visit me. I'll be waiting. Do come, we'll talk.
