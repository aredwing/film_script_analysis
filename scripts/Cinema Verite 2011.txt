AND IT PROBES THE DAY-TO-DAY LIVES OF A FAMILY FROM SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA. THEY AGREED TO LET A FILM CREW LIVE WITH THEM FOR MONTHS ON END AND THEIR MOST PRIVATE MOMENTS HAVE BECOME PUBLIC. THE SERIES HAS BEEN WIDELY REVIEWED AND CRITICIZED. AND NOBODY IS SURE-- MAYBE THEY'RE NOT-- WHY THEY LET THEMSELVES IN FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THEY DID. BUT THAT'LL BE ONE OF THE THINGS MAYBE WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT. I HAD THIS VISION OF THE LOUD FAMILY THAT I JUS COULDN'T SHAKE-- SEVEN PEOPLE STANDING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN SOLIDARITY, BONDED BY BLOOD AND TIME AND LOVE... WITH A HUSBAND AND A FATHER WHO WAS HOME AND THERE FOR US ALL. STARS SHINING BRIGH ABOVE YOU  NIGHT BREEZES SEEM TO WHISPER  I LOVE YOU  BIRDS SINGING IN THE SYCAMORE TREE  DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME  SAY NIGHTY-NIGH AND KISS ME  JUST HOLD ME TIGHT  AND TELL ME YOU'LL MISS ME  WHILE I'M ALONE  AND BLUE AS CAN BE  DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME  STARS FADING  BUT I LINGER ON, DEAR  STILL CRAVING  YOUR KISS  I'M LONGING TO LINGER  TILL DAWN, DEAR  JUST SAYING THIS  SWEET DREAMS TILL SUNBEAMS FIND YOU  SWEET DREAMS THAT LEAVE ALL WORRIES  BEHIND YOU  BUT IN YOUR DREAMS  WHATEVER THEY BE  DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME...  DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME...  - PAT. - MARY. OH, RIGHT ON TIME. WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? OH, YOU'LL SEE. COME, DEAR. WE'RE SITTING RIGHT UP THERE. CRAIG. CRAIG GILBERT, THIS IS PAT LOUD. - HELLO. - A PLEASURE. - CRAIG'S A VISITOR FROM THE BIG APPLE. - OH. - HE'S FRIENDS WITH MY EDITOR. - WELCOME. WELL, PLEASE, SIT SIT. CRAIG'S WORKING ON A VERY INTERESTING PROJECT. WELL, I MAKE DOCUMENTARY FILMS, PAT-- NOTHING YOU'D HAVE HEARD OF. RECENTLY I JUST DID SOMETHING ON THE WORK OF MARGARET MEAD. SHE'S A WELL-KNOWN ANTHROPOLOGIST. YES, SHE WROTE "COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA," WHICH I QUITE ENJOYED. - I'M IMPRESSED. - SHE'S DEAD ON ABOUT GENDER ROLES. FATHERS ARE BIOLOGICAL NECESSITIES, BUT SOCIAL ACCIDENTS. SHE ALSO SAID, "I DON'T BELIEVE IN USING WOMEN IN COMBAT BECAUSE - THE FEMALES ARE TOO FIERCE." - "FEMALES ARE TOO FIERCE." WHY IS IT I THINK WE ALREADY KNOW MORE ABOUT EACH OTHER THAN WE SHOULD? DIDN'T I TELL YOU? SHE'S PERFECT. PAT, I WANT TO OBSERVE AN AMERICAN FAMILY MUCH LIKE MARGARE OBSERVED A PRIMITIVE ONE, EXCEPT THIS TIME I'D LIKE THE CAMERA TEAM TO MOVE IN WITH THE FAMILY. AND I THINK THAT I FOUND MY FAMILY LAST NIGH WHEN MARY TOLD ME ABOUT YOU AND SHOWED ME THIS WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS CARD. MM, WHY WOULD ANYONE WAN TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH A THING? WELL, TO EDUCATE. TO BE PAR OF A BRAVE NEW EXPERIMEN WITH A REAL FAMILY, WITH REAL PEOPLE THAT AUDIENCES CAN RELATE TO. YOU WERE HIS FIRST CHOICE. I SHOWED HIM THE CARTERS, THE PERCYS, THE HALLS. THEY'RE ALWAYS IN HER SOCIETY COLUMN. YES, BUT NONE ARE AS INTERESTING AS THE LOUD FAMILY. AND HER KIDS-- HER KIDS ARE SO POPULAR. EVERYONE'S ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THEM. TIME  IS ON MY SIDE  YES, IT IS  TIME  IS ON MY SIDE  YES, IT IS  NOW YOU WERE SAYING  THAT YOU WAN TO BE FREE....  LANCE, WAIT UP. COME ON, HURRY UP. I CAN'T MISS IT. DADDY TRIED TO BE HERE TOO, YOU KNOW, SWEETIE, BUT HIS BUSINESS TRIP GOT EXTENDED. AREN'T THEY ALWAYS? ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. - I LOVE YOU. - OH, COLD NEW YORK NIGHTS-- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LOW RESISTANCE, BABY. THEY'RE CLOSING THE DOOR. GO. - BYE, LANCE. - LOVE YOU. - I'M GONNA MISS YOU. - SAY HI TO ANDY WARHOL FOR ME. GO AHEAD  GO AND LIGHT UP THAT TOWN  AND, BABY, DO EVERYTHING YOUR HEART DESIRES  REMEMBER, I'LL BE AROUND  AND I KNOW  LIKE I TOLD YOU SO MANY TIMES BEFORE  OH, YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK, BABY  YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK  YOU'RE GONNA BE KNOCK-KNOCKING ON MY DOOR  TIME TIME TIME  IS ON MY SIDE  - YES, IT IS....  - Girl: DAD'S HERE. - HEY, DAD. - HEY, DAD, WHAT'S UP? - HEY. - LOOKING GOOD. NICE SUIT, MAN. YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE BACK TILL TOMORROW. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? HEY, JOE NAMATH. - HEY, PATTY? - HMM? YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING WHEN I GOT HOME TONIGHT? WHAT'S THAT, BILL? WHEN I SAW THOSE KIDS PLAYING OUT THERE ON THE LAWN, RUNNING AROUND WITH THE SUNLIGHT IN THEIR HAIR, I WAS THINKING WE ARE LIKE-- - YOUR HAIRBRUSH. - MY HAIRBRUSH? - IT'S CLEAN. - AND? - WHO CLEANED IT? - I CLEANED IT. YOU'VE NEVER CLEANED YOUR HAIRBRUSH IN YOUR LIFE. PATTY, I'VE CLEANED MY BRUSH BEFORE AND I CLEANED I THIS TIME. WHY? BECAUSE IT HAD DOG HAIR IN IT. BILL NEVIN'S FOUR-YEAR-OLD OPENS UP MY SUITCASE AND BRUSHES HIS GOLDEN RETRIEVER WITH MY HAIRBRUSH. - UNBELIEVABLE, RIGHT? - I AGREE. SO WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY WAS THAT WHEN I WAS OUT THERE PLAYING FOOTBALL ON THE LAWN, I WAS THINKING WE'RE LIKE THE WEST COAST KENNEDYS. DO YOU MEAN THAT AS A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING? IT'S A COMPLIMENT, PATTY. I'M SAYING WE'VE GO A FAMILY TO BE PROUD OF HERE. IT'S INTERESTING YOU SHOULD MENTION THAT, BECAUSE I MET A FILMMAKER WHO'S LOOKING FOR THE IDEAL FAMILY TO PUT ON TV. REALLY? OF COURSE I TOLD HIM WE COULDN'T PARTICIPATE, BEING THAT YOU'RE AWAY SO MUCH. HOLD ON A MINUTE. I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU KNEW ALICE. SHE WAS MY SOPHOMORE ROOMMATE AT STANFORD. HER BROTHER JIMMY WAS IN MY HOUSE AT HARVARD. OH MY, WHAT A SMALL WORLD. SO, BILL, WHERE DID YOU STUDY? I MATRICULATED A THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS. YES, BILL WASN' MUCH OF A STUDENT, BUT HE MAKES MORE MONEY THAN MOST IVY LEAGUERS. YOU KNOW WHAT THE SECRET IS? YOU GOTTA LOVE IT. IF YOU DON'T LOVE IT, YOU CAN'T SELL IT. GOD HELP ME, YOU CAN LAUGH IF YOU WANT, BUT I LOVE STRIP MINES AND I LOVE SELLING SHOVEL TEETH. IT'S LIKE BROADWAY, BABY. MR. GILBERT SAW "HAIR" ON BROADWAY. HE SAID IT WAS LIKE A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE. YEAH, MR. GILBERT KNOWS MICK JAGGER TOO. YOUR BOYS HAVE PROMISED ME A CONCERT. WAIT UNTIL YOU MEET LANCE. HE'S THE COOLEST OF US ALL. - BUT HE MOVED TO NEW YORK. - TO MEET ANDY WARHOL. WELL, WE CAN SHOOT HIM IN NEW YORK. BUT HE'S NO IN THE HOUSE, AND THAT'S WHA THE SHOW IS, RIGHT-- WHAT GOES ON IN THE HOUSE? THE HOUSE, THE SCHOOL, THE SUPERMARKET, WHEREVER THE FAMILY GOES. - WHAT ABOUT THE BATHROOM? - NO NO. SERIOUSLY, WHAT IS OFF-LIMITS? WHY, BILL? YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE? WELL, NO, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION-- THE THRESHOLD OF PRIVACY. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS AND DECIDE UPON. WHAT ABOUT PAYMENT? NO NO. THE PUBLIC HAS TO BE CERTAIN THERE'S NO MANIPULATION GOING ON. I DON'T KNOW THEN. I STILL DON'T SEE ANY UPSIDE TO IT. COME ON, DAD. IT'LL BE SO MUCH FUN. WELL, YOU MIGHT, WHEN YOU SEE JOHNNY HALL AS THE HEAD OF THE MOS FAMOUS HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA. - JOHNNY HALL? - MM. WHAT'S SO GREA ABOUT HIS FAMILY? HIS WIFE HAS GO A MUSTACHE AND HIS KIDS ARE PRACTICALLY BRAIN DEAD. DAD! - SO THAT WOULD BE A YES? - YES. WHEN BILL WOULD GO AWAY, I WAS JUST LEFT AT HOME WITH MY OWN WORST FEARS. FINALLY I DECIDED THAT... WHAT I NEEDED TO DO WAS TO KEEP BILL HOME AND SHOW HIM AND THE WORLD THAT HIS FAMILY WAS AN INDESTRUCTIBLE THING. GENTLEMEN, MEET THE LOUDS. THE HANDSOME, HARD-WORKING, NIXON-SUPPORTING DAD, THE SMART, SULTRY MOM. SHE'S A LITTLE TOO LATE FOR WOMEN'S LIB, BUT TOO YOUNG TO BE A DISCARDED HOUSEWIFE. THE 16 YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WHO IS EXPERIENCING HER FIRST SERIOUS BOYFRIEND. THE LITTLE ONE WHO IS IN LOVE WITH HER HORSE. THE TWO BOYS WHO THINK THEY'RE THE NEXT ROLLING STONES. AND THE ELDEST-- HE'S MOVED TO MANHATTAN TO MAKE IT. I HAVE YE TO MEET HIM. WHY NO APPLAUSE HERE, GENTLEMEN? FOR WHAT, FIVE HOURS OF "PASS THE SALT"? I DON'T GET THE POINT. THE POINT IS WE'VE GONE TO THE MOON AND BEYOND, BUT WE HAVE YET TO GET PAS THE AMERICAN FRONT DOOR. AND WHEN WE GE PAST THAT DOOR, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO FIND? THE SMILING FACES ON THE CHRISTMAS CARDS? THE CUTE LITTLE JOKES WITH THE LAUGH TRACKS? NO. NOW ONE HAS EVER DONE THIS BEFORE, SO IF ANYONE SHOULD BE ASKING WHAT THE POINT IS, IT SHOULD BE ME-- OF HAVING TO BEG TO FINANCE WHAT COULD BE THE MOST GROUNDBREAKING EVER PUT ON THE AIR. - 10 HOURS? - YEAH. YOU HEARD THAT. I HEARD THAT, YES. WELL, YOU JUST REMEMBER THIS LAUGH WHEN YOU SEE THE DAILIES AND YOU'RE BEGGING ME FOR MORE. ALL RIGHT, CRAIG, I'M GONNA TAKE YOU UP ON THAT. IF I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE REST OF THE FINANCING, I NEED YOU HERE TO SCREEN DAILIES EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, SO WE CAN BE SURE YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING WORTH PUTTING ON. - ABSOLUTELY. - MR. GILBERT. YOUR ASSISTANT PU A PHONE CALL THROUGH. - THIS PICKS UP EVERYTHING? - MM-HMM, I'M GONNA WRAP THIS AROUND RIGHT HERE. YEAH, WE'LL BE PUTTING IN SOME HIGHER-WATTAGE BULBS. PAT, I WAS JUS DESCRIBING YOU AND I USED AN ADJECTIVE THAT ACTUALLY MADE ME BLUSH. Why aren't you here, Craig? MY HOUSE IS BEING TORN APAR BY A BUNCH OF NEW YORKERS. They're just prerigging a little. WHEN THEY'RE DONE YOU'LL HARDLY NOTICE. WHAT'S THIS ABOUT YOU FILMING MY TRIP TO MANHATTAN? THEY SAY YOU WAN TO START WITH THAT NOW? WELL, YOU DECIDED TO VISI YOUR SON AND WE THOUGH THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING. By the way, where is Lance? Where is he staying? OH, UM, I BELIEVE HE'S STAYING AT A PLACE CALLED THE, UH, CHELSEA HOTEL. LANCE? WE'RE GOING TO THE LA MAMA THEATER TONIGHT-- THE ULTIMATE OF UNDERGROUND, HONEY. YOU'LL JUST THINK IT'S SO NEAT. YEAH, ALL THE UNDERGROUND STARS ARE THERE. IT'S A BIG PLACE. ALL THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. OH, I KNOW, BUT YOU'VE DREAMED OF THEM. GOT TO PAY YOUR DUES  IF YOU WAN TO SING THE BLUES  AND YOU KNOW IT DON'T COME EASY  BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT...  WHAT'VE WE GOT? UH, FIVE-SIX. I THINK THIS IS HER. - YEAH. - SLATE IT. ROLLING IT. AN AMERICAN FAMILY, TAKE ONE. GOT IT. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA NEED THAT SUN GUN WHEN WE GO IN THERE. - THAT LOBBY'S TOO DARK. - YEAH. WE'RE STARTING RIGHT NOW? YEAH, JUST KEEP ON COMING. REMEMBER, WE'RE INVISIBLE. YOU'RE RIGH IN FRONT OF ME. IT'S OKAY. JUST KEEP WALKING. WE'LL GIVE WAY. AND TRY NOT TO TALK TO THE CAMERA, PAT.

I APPLIED FOR THE-- FOR THE CLEANING JOB, BUT THEY SAID I HAD TO WEAR A HAIR NET, AND I JUS COULDN'T DO THAT. WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER ABOUT THE SHOW? OH, UM, YEAH.

YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. LIKE JACKIE CURTIS AND CANDY-- SHE'S RIGHT THERE. SHE'S STARRING IN IT. - OH, SHE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS? - SHE WANTS TO MARRY HIM ACTUALLY. - REALLY? - OH YEAH. SHE THINKS HE'S THE ALL-AMERICAN BOY AND SHE'S THE ALL-AMERICAN GIRL. SHE'S VERY PRETTY. SO DO YOU WANT TO GO TO YOUR ROOM NOW, GO UP? YOU SAID I'D BE NEXT DOOR TO YOU. WHY AM I UP THERE? BECAUSE IT'S BIG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO SWEEP IN THE DOOR LIKE LORETTA YOUNG, YOU KNOW. THERE'S A CAMERA. MY GOD, A CAMERA. I HAD NO IDEA. YOU KNOW, YOU WERE INVISIBLE JUST LIKE THEY SAID YOU'D BE. LISTEN, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY? NICE TO MEET YOU. DROP INTO OUR ORBIT  WHERE QUEENS CAN COLLIDE  AND JIGGLE YOUR SWEET SPOT  INTO MADCAP YEARNING, OOH...  SHE WAS THE GREATES STAR OF ALL.

DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE TAKING ME TO SEE THIS? OH, OF COURSE NOT. I HAD NO IDEA THAT WAS HAPPENING. OH, IT'S NOT HAPPENING. TRANSVESTITES? THIS ALL GO STARTED OFF WRONG. IF THIS SEQUENCE UPSETS YOU, WE DON'T HAVE TO USE IT. IT'S NOT ME. IT'S BILL. IF HE EVER SAW THIS HE'D HAVE A STROKE. DON'T MAKE HIM LOOK FOOLISH, CRAIG. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, LET ME JUST SAY SOMETHING. I THINK LANCE IS AMAZING AND I CAN TELL MY CREW DOES TOO. HE'S SMART AND HE'S WITTY AND HE'S INCREDIBLY SPECIAL. WELL, I KNOW ALL THAT. I'M JUST SCARED-- THESE PEOPLE, THIS PLACE. WELL, HE'S TRYING TO FIND HIMSELF AND MANHATTAN IS THE PLACE TO DO THAT. - YOU REALLY THINK SO? - YES. NOW ARE YOU OKAY? WELL, I'D GIVE YOU A HUG, BUT I DON' WANT TO SEEM INAPPROPRIATE. WELL, I TELL YOU, THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING LIBERATING ABOUT GETTING OUT OF TOWN. FOR ONCE IT'S ALL IN BILL'S LAP. WELL, HIS TRAVELING MUST BE HARD ON YOU. YES, IT'S HARD ON ALL OF US. DO YOU GET LONELY? WELL, IT'S ALL... VERY COMPLICATED. I'M NOT EVEN SURE I UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF. WELL, MAYBE THE SHOW CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT SAY WHEN YOU TURN A CAMERA ON THINGS, THE TRUTH JUST RISES TO THE SURFACE. WHAT, LIKE DUMPLINGS? SO... DO YOU HAVE A WIFE AND KIDS? NO NO. MY MARRIAGE COLLAPSED. OH. YES, IT TURNED OUT THA WE WEREN'T THE RIGHT FIT. I'M SORRY. YES, IT WAS-- WELL, THERE REALLY ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT.

ON THE PHONE YOU MENTIONED-- WELL, I GET FLOWERY WHEN I'M IN MY SELLING MODE. WELL, WHAT WAS THE WORD? IT WAS "SULTRY." - SULTRY? - MM-HMM. BUT I SAID SMART TOO. I LIKE SULTRY. It's kind of late there. Have you been prowling the streets all night? - LANCE TOOK ME TO A SHOW. - How's he doing? - FOUND A JOB YET? - No, but he's making lots of friends. GOOD GOOD. ANY GIRLS? THAT'S STILL MY HOPE, YOU KNOW, THAT IF HE COULD JUS MEET THE RIGHT GIRL AND-- YOU KNOW, I THINK HE HAS. Really? YES, SHE WAS IN THE SHOW TONIGHT. Well, finally some encouraging news. WHAT ELSE? HAS THA GILBERT BEEN AROUND? UH, MM-HMM. - You betcha. - HOW MUCH HAVE YOU HAD TO DRINK, PATTY? ENOUGH TO PUT ME TO SLEEP. I LOVE IT HERE, MOM. I WISH I COULD STAY AT THE CHELSEA FOREVER. YOU REALLY NEVER FELT AT HOME IN SANTA BARBARA, DID YOU? I MEAN, LOOKING BACK ON IT, THERE WERE THINGS THA I COULD'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY, BUT I JUST ALWAYS FEL THAT I STOOD APAR FROM THE RES OF THE FAMILY SO MUCH. I MEAN, MAYBE YOU GUYS COULD'VE-- COULD'VE WHAT? OH, I DON'T KNOW. DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY. IT'S ALL OKAY NOW. BY THE WAY, DAD WANTS TO PASS THROUGH NEW YORK ON ONE OF HIS UPCOMING TRIPS. DO ME A FAVOR-- DON'T GET HIM A ROOM AT THE CHELSEA HOTEL. YOU KNOW, I STILL NEVER KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HIM. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR FATHER. HE'S SUCH A CONVERSATIONALIST, HE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE WHOLE THING. BUT THAT'S NO ACTUALLY TALKING, MOM. YOU KNOW, THAT'S KILLING TIME. WELL, SOMETIMES THAT'S THE BES YOU CAN ASK FOR. THE BOYS ARE SO SO LAZY. BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY TO LEAD THEM AS FAR AS YOU CAN. YOU STILL HAVE ALL THA HEAVY EQUIPMENT TO GET? OH, HELLO. WELCOME HOME, PATRICIA. OH, YOU'RE A VISION. DID YOU MAKE YOUR CONNECTING FLIGHT OKAY? WHY, YES, WE DID. OH. DID YOU MAKE YOUR CONNECTING FLIGHT OKAY? YES. HOW ABOUT I TAKE YOU GUYS TO LUNCH? YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED. THEY CAN'T SPEAK TO YOU WHEN THEY'RE FILMING, BILL. OH, TAKE TWO. HOW ABOUT I TAKE MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE TO LUNCH? - ON CAMERA OR OFF? - MY LIFE'S AN OPEN BOOK. OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. WE'LL PUT A LITTLE CAMI BEHIND I AND EVERYTHING WILL BE ABSOLUTELY FINE. WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR A MINUTE? MICHELLE, WOULD YOU PLEASE? WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY IT ON? PATS. PATSY. - VAL, HI. - HI THERE, VAL. - BILL. - HI THERE, VAL. SO I WAS GOING TO CALL YOU. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO? OH, JUST GRABBING A BITE AT EL PASEO. WELL, DO STOP BY WHEN YOU'RE DONE. I CAN SET YOU UP WITH A NEW SPRING OUTFIT, COMPLETE WITH PURSE, HAT AND SHOES, ALL ON THE HOUSE. OH MY GOODNESS. WHY? BECAUSE I'D LOVE AMERICA TO SEE MY NEW SPRING LINE IS WHY. AND BILL PROMISED HE COULD GET ME A WARDROBE CREDIT. OH, THAT'S MY BILL. - DID I? - ALWAYS FULL OF PROMISES. WELL WELL WELL, IT'S AMERICA'S PERFECT FAMILY. - HI THERE, JEREMY. HOW'S IT GOING? - HI, BILL. - SO NICE TO SEE YOU. - HI. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE A MOVIE STAR? WELL... YOU GOT A NICE TAN WHILE I WAS AWAY. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, KIDDO. THIS STRIKE'S GONNA DO ME IN. ARE WE GONNA GO BROKE, BILL? YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. LANCE LIVING IT UP IN NEW YORK-- I HOPE HE KNOWS HE'S ON A SHORT STRING THERE. WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY ANYMORE. HE LOVES MANHATTAN. HE'S SO HAPPY HE BURSTS INTO SONG SOMETIMES. HE HAS SUCH A SPARK OF LIFE, LIKE NO ONE I'VE EVER KNOWN, SO OPEN AND FUNNY. THAT'S GREAT, BUT HE'S GOT TO STAR THINKING ABOUT A JOB TOO. THESE KIDS GOT TO LEARN THE VALUE OF WORK. I TELL GRANT THAT HE CAN MAKE $10 AN HOUR HAULING CEMENT FOR DAVID WITZELL, AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES? HE GIVES ME THA WOLFMAN JACK DOG CALL-- "NO WAY, BROTHER. NO WAY. I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE AND I'M PLAYING WITH THE BAND." THAT BAND IS HIS DREAM, BILL. WELL, OKAY, BUT HOW ABOU FINDING A DREAM THAT BRINGS IN SOME BUCKS? WELL, HOW ABOU RAISING PEOPLE THAT HAVE A SHO AT BEING HAPPY? HOW ABOUT HAVING PARENTS THAT MAKE CERTAIN THEIR KIDS KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG, WHAT THEY SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T DO? I THINK THAT WOULD BE NICE TOO, DON'T YOU? I KNOW THESE GUYS THINK YOUR LITTLE ESCAPADE IN NEW YORK WAS MORE EXCITING THAN FILMING ME HOLDING DOWN THE FORT HERE, BUT BELIEVE ME, THIS WEEK OF BABYSITTING GAVE ME A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT GOES ON WHEN I'M GONE. REALLY? LIKE WHAT? LIKE A 16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER THAT STAYS OUT HALF THE NIGH AFTER A DANCE PRACTICE-- ON A SCHOOL NIGHT, PAT? SURE, IT'S FUN AND EASY BEING FRIENDS WITH YOUR KIDS, BUT HOW ABOUT GIVING THEM A LITTLE STRUCTURE? THIS CONVERSATION WILL END RIGHT HERE. I'LL SPEAK TO CRAIG IN THE MORNING ABOUT DROPPING THIS FROM THE FILM. BAIT ME IN FRON OF THE CAMERA AGAIN AND YOU'LL BE VERY VERY SORRY, BILL. So you let her walk off just like that? CRAIG, SHE LEF ON HER OWN VOLITION. I CAN'T INTERFERE WITH THE EVENTS AS THEY'RE HAPPENING. WELL, YOU COULD'VE FOLLOWED HER. There was finally genuine drama unfolding AND YOU DIDN' GET IT ON FILM. BELIEVE ME, WE GOT PLENTY ON FILM. Well, actually I think you barely scratched the surface. AND I DON'T APPRECIATE THIS ATTITUDE. This isn't about an attitude. THIS IS ABOU DOCUMENTARY ETHICS. Alan, your job is to film the Louds-- NO JUDGMENTS, NO INVOLVEMENTS, NO PERSONAL FEELINGS. - I know-- - THAT'S WHAT W.N.E.T. CONTRACTED YOU FOR AND THAT'S WHERE YOUR ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY LIES. SO LET'S GE ON THE SAME PAGE HERE AND YOU SHOOT WHAT I NEED TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL FILM. - HAVE A NICE DAY. THANK YOU. - Okay, Craig-- WHEN CRAIG GILBER HIRED US, WE HAD NO IDEA WHA WE WERE GETTING INTO. FIRST OF ALL, WE WERE JUST MARRIED AND I THINK WE HAD SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE EXOTIC IN MIND FOR OUR HONEYMOON THAN A ROOMFUL OF FILM EQUIPMENT. WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? THE SUBJECT MATTER, I THINK-- FOR ME ANYWAY. FOR ME IT WAS THE CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING PURE-- CINEMA VERITE, THE CINEMA OF TRUTH. HEY, DAD, YOUR TAXI'S HERE. - OKAY, HONEY. ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GO. HELLO? HI, LANCE! GUYS, IT'S LANCE. HE'S CALLING COLLECT. ACCEPT THE CHARGES, SWEETIE. - HELLO? - Hi! HI, GUYS. I have very exciting news. WHAT IS IT, HONEY? DID YOU GET A JOB? I'M GOING TO PARIS. - PARIS? - HE GOT A JOB IN PARIS? LANCE, ARE YOU IN HIGH SPIRITS AGAIN? Am I-- am I--? Yes, I am in high spirits! LANCE, LANCE, IT'S DAD. - Hi, Dad. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN PARIS? I AM DOING STREET THEATER. THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. I'M DOING IT WITH THIS REALLY REALLY SUPER GROUP OF PEOPLE. IS THAT ONE OF THOSE "UP WITH PEOPLE" KIND OF DEALS? You know, I didn't ask, but I tell them how great you are, not that I don't say that Mother isn't. In fact, I think I say that Mother's a bit greater even than you, but you know what I mean. Hold on a second. HEY, GUYS, GET ME A TOASTED ALMOND. OKAY, HONEY. - CATCH. - OH, WE'RE RICH! - Lance. - WHAT? I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO'S FINANCING THIS TRIP. OH, UH, THIS REALLY REALLY NICE, VERY RICH MAN WHOSE NAME I DON'T REMEMBER. - HE'S NOT GOING TO PARIS. - Maybe it's-- oh, I don't know. - I GOTTA GO. - Paul or John or Ringo OR SOMETHING. HE'S NOT GOING TO PARIS. HONEY, YOUR FATHER SAYS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PARIS. I'M ACTUALLY FLATTERED. NO ONE'S EVER TOLD ME THAT BEFORE. Lance, honey, how are you really? Have you been taking care of that cold? I JUST NEED YOU TO BE A LITTLE MORE PATIENT. YOU'RE BURNING 18 ROLLS OF FILM PER DAY. YOU'RE WAY OVER BUDGET AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH DRAMA. NOW I THINK WE'VE BEEN MORE THAN PATIENT. A HUGE PART OF THIS PROCESS IS ESTABLISHING A COMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SUBJECT AND THE CAMERA. SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD HEAD OUT TO SANTA BARBARA AND JUST PUSH THA RELATIONSHIP ALONG. WELCOME HOME. OH MY GOD. - WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? TO HELL AND BACK? - YOU GOT THAT RIGHT. I'VE BEEN BAKING ON A JOB SITE FOR THREE DAYS. WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME, KEMOSABE? IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE JUST A SHORT TRIP. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T GET A FREE MINUTE. IT'S BAD OUT THERE, PATTY. KERN COUNTY QUARRY HAD TO CLOSE DOWN BECAUSE THE TEAMSTERS HAVE JOINED THE STRIKE AND I GOT $200,000 WORTH OF EQUIPMEN SITTING ON A DOCK IN GALVESTON. WE CAN'T HIDE IT, MOM. THEY'VE GOT TO START HAMMERING. MAN, ARE YOU BURNED. HIDE WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON? WELCOME TO WOODSTOCK WEST, MAN. A NEW ROCK GROUP IS GONNA BREAK HERE ON SATURDAY. YEAH, IT'LL HELP US GE SOME GIGS THIS SUMMER. YOU HAVE A GIG THIS SUMMER, GRANT-- HAULING CEMENT IN ORANGE COUNTY FOR DAVID WITZELL. I DON'T THINK SO. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE POURING CEMENT, GRANT. I'M PUTTING YOU TO WORK TOO. LOOKS LIKE YOUR SUMMER BUSINESS TRIP IS TO AUSTRALIA WITH BIG TODD TO HELP HIM PICK UP SOME NEW CLIENTS. WAIT, HE GOES TO AUSTRALIA AND I SHOVEL CEMENT? DO I LOOK LIKE CEMENT GUY? DO I LOOK LIKE ARISTOTLE ONASSIS? - WHO DO YOU THINK PAYS FOR ALL THIS? - WE DID. - YOU DID? - YES. REALLY? WITH WHAT MONEY? THE MONEY MOM GAVE US FOR DOING CHORES. WHERE DO YOU THINK MOM GETS HER MONEY? WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE? WHY DON'T WE DISCUSS THIS LATER? WHY WEREN'T YOU WEARING A SHIRT? IT WAS A 110. I DIDN'T KNOW THE SUN WAS SO HOT. THAT FEELS NICE WHEN YOU TOUCH ME LIKE THAT. WHY'D YOU STOP? BECAUSE I DON'T WAN TO GIVE YOU THE WRONG IDEA. WHAT IDEA IS THAT? THAT EVERYTHING IS OKAY WITH US. YOU PROMISED ME THAT IF WE DID THIS SHOW YOU'D BE HOME MORE. YOU KNOW, I WAS FLYING BACK HERE THINKING EVEN IF MY BUSINESS FALLS APART, I ALWAYS GOT YOU, I ALWAYS GOT THE FAMILY. THEN WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS RUNNING AWAY FROM US? I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU WANT. WELL, FOR STARTERS, IT WOULD BE NICE IF ONCE IN A WHILE YOU LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS WORTH SOMETHING. A MAN NEEDS THA FROM TIME TO TIME. AND WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU THINK IT IS A WOMAN NEEDS, BILL? I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT A WOMAN NEEDS. I THINK WE CAN BOTH AGREE ON THAT. OW! OW OW OW. STOP IT. WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? HONEY. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOU. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE FOR ME, THE ONLY ONE THAT EVER MATTERED. OW. - OH. - MY BACK. HI. YES, IS VAL AROUND? I'D LIKE TO TAKE HER UP ON HER OFFER. HEY, PAT. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. MY BOYS ARE GIVING A CONCERT THIS WEEKEND. IT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO LOOK GLAMOROUS. HEY, I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU. LOOK AT THIS. I'VE GOT THESE ADORABLE LITTLE PASTEL JUMPERS WITH MATCHING SHOES AND THERE'S A TURQUOISE ONE THAT WOULD LOOK SUPER KEEN ON YOU. WHAT? YOU DON'T LIKE IT? THAT'S QUITE A SUNBURN, VAL. YEAH, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? ONE DAY OF GARDENING. YOU SHOULD SEE MY BACK. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY? THAT LOOKS LIKE MORE THAN ONE DAY OF GARDENING TO ME. TWO AND A HALF. I LIED. TWO AND A HALF. THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT. YOU SHOULD GET A JOB WITH COPPERTONE. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU WANT TO TRY IT ON? IT COMES IN FIVE COLORS. - I'LL TAKE ONE OF EACH. - OH. AND FORGET THE FREEBIE. BILL TOLD ME TO USE HIS CREDIT CARD AND BUY WHATEVER I WANT, NO MATTER WHAT THE PRICE. WELL, THAT'S REALLY-- IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER, I'D THINK HE WAS FEELING A LITTLE BIT GUILTY, WOULDN'T YOU? OR MAYBE IT'S JUST THA HE LOVES ME SO. UM, COME TO THINK OF IT, I'LL NEED SOME SHOES AND, UM, YEAH, SOME LUGGAGE MAYBE. YEAH, I MIGHT BE TRAVELING SOON WITH THE CHILDREN. IT'LL BREAK BILL'S HEAR TO BE LEFT HERE ALL ALONE, BUT I TOLD THE GIRLS WE MIGH GO TO TAOS THIS SUMMER. HOW WOULD THA WORK FOR YOU? COULD I SEE YOU FOR A MINUTE? WHAT ON EARTH IS YOUR PROBLEM? YOU OFFERED TO SHOW ME YOUR SUNBURNED BACK. DO YOU MIND? I THINK THOSE CAMERAS FOLLOWING YOU AROUND HAS MADE YOU A LITTLE NUTS. ARE YOU COMING TO THE CONCERT? I'M NOT SURE IF I SHOULD. OH, THE BOYS WOULD BE HURT IF YOU DIDN'T COME. WE'VE ALWAYS THOUGH OF YOU AS FAMILY, VAL. WE'LL BE FIGHTING IN THE STREET  WITH OUR CHILDREN AT OUR FEET  AND THE MORALS THAT THEY WORSHIP  WILL BE GONE  I'LL TIP MY HA TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION  TAKE A BOW FOR THE NEW REVOLUTION  SMILE AND GRIN AT THE CHANGE ALL AROUND  PICK UP MY GUITAR AND PLAY  JUST LIKE YESTERDAY  AND I'LL GE ON MY KNEES AND PRAY  WE DON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN...  PAT LOUD? THE PAT LOUD? I'M CRAIG GILBERT FROM NEW YORK. I'M A BIG FAN. I THOUGH FANS WERE LOYAL. IT'S REALLY BEEN QUITE A WHILE, YOU KNOW? I KNOW, I KNOW. I COULDN'T GET AWAY. BUT I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU EVERY DAY IN DAILIES AND YOU ARE AMAZING IN EVERY FRAME. ARE ALL MEN BULLSHITTERS, CRAIG, OR JUST THE ONES IN MY LIFE? FOR A GROUP TO ATTAIN SUPER STARDOM, THEY HAVE TO BE ABOUT ONE PERSON. NOW, THE SUPREMES HAVE IT. THE EMOTIONS DON'T. SO DO THESE KIDS STAND A CHANCE AT MAKING IT? - I'M TOM, BY THE WAY-- PATTY'S BROTHER. - HELLO. SURE, THEY'RE GREAT. THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY STICK WITH IT. OH, NOW THAT'S EASY FOR A GUY WITH NO KIDS TO SAY. LIFE'S ALL ABOUT CHASING YOUR DREAMS, RIGHT? WHY, I EVEN GOT ONE WHO THINKS I'M GONNA FLY HIM OFF TO PARIS. WELL, ACTUALLY HE'S IN PARIS. HE'S WHAT? AND I SENT A CINEMATOGRAPHER OFF AFTER HIM. GOOD FOR OLD LANCE. HE GOT SOMEONE TO PAY FOR A TRIP OTHER THAN HIS OLD MAN. FINE BY ME. - ALAN. - WELL, IT'S NOT FINE BY ME. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT PARIS FOOTAGE. IN FACT, I'D LIKE TO SEE ALL THE FOOTAGE AND FIND OU WHAT THE HELL ELSE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY FAMILY AND WHAT YOU'RE AIMING FOR WITH ANY OF THIS. ALL RIGHT. THINK OF A SPACESHIP LANDING ON EARTH AND FINDING A TIME CAPSULE. AND INSIDE THAT TIME CAPSULE IS A FILM. AND ON THE FILM EVERYONE IS SMILING AND SAFE IN THE CERTAINTY OF EACH OTHER'S LOVE. BUT AS IT TURNS OUT, ALL THE ALIENS FOUND WAS AN OLD EPISODE OF "THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY." NOW IS THAT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO LEAVE BEHIND AS A CULTURE-- SOMETHING THAT'S THE COMPLETE ANTITHESIS OF HOW WE REALLY LIVE, FUMBLING AROUND IN CONFUSION? OH, THAT'S FULL OF SHIT. FUMBLING AROUND IN CONFUSION? THE LOUDS ARE NOT CONFUSED AND WE ARE NO FUMBLING AROUND. I AM FINE. MY FAMILY IS FINE. I AM GOING TO COME TO THE MOTEL TO LOOK AT SOME FOOTAGE TOMORROW, CRAIG. AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING ABOU IT THAT GIVES A FALSE IMPRESSION THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE SENSE OF OUR LIVES, IT'S NOT GOING ON THE AIR. Who did that? Our sons are criminals. I have to wash my hair again tonight. THERE'S 86,000' OF FILM THERE, PAT, EVERY FRAME AS GOOD AS THAT. NOW WE COULD SIT HERE FOR DAYS AND I'D BE HAPPY TO DO THA IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO-- NO, THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. I'LL SEND A PROJECTOR OVER WHEN THE PARIS FOOTAGE COMES IN. I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR LAST NIGHT. I'VE BEEN HAVING KIND OF A TOUGH TIME. WELL, THAT'S CLEAR TO SEE. ARE YOU AND BILL HAVING PROBLEMS? THE PAINFUL TRUTH IS THAT YES, WE HAVE HAD A ROCKY PAST AND... NOW I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE ARE. WELL, I CAN' SPEAK FOR BILL, BUT THE PAT LOUD THAT I SEE IS A VISION OF A LIBERATED MODERN WOMAN. PANTSUITS WILL DO THAT. IN FACT, I SEE A ROLE MODEL. WOMEN ALL ACROSS AMERICA ARE GOING TO LOOK TO YOU FOR A ROADMAP OF HOW TO BE AND WHO TO BE. YOU'RE IN THE POSITION TO SHOW WOMEN, WHOSE STRENGTH IS ERODING, HOW TO TAKE BACK THEIR LIVES. AS USUAL, YOU ARE VERY ELOQUENT. WELL, LAST NIGHT YOU ASKED ME IF I WAS A BULLSHITTER. ARE YOU? TEST ME. WHEN WE FIRST MET I TOLD YOU WHAT I THOUGHT OF YOU. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF ME? I THOUGHT, "IF THAT GUY CAN FIX HIS FLABBY BODY, I'VE ME MY PERFECT MAN." I ALWAYS FANTASIZED THAT IF I COULD FIND THE RIGHT MAN, I'D LEAVE HIM. BECAUSE I CANNO LIVE ALONE. I ABSOLUTELY CAN'T DO IT. I'M GOING THROUGH THIS STAGE IN MY LIFE NOW WHERE LANCE HAS LEFT. SOON THE REST OF MY KIDS WILL FOLLOW. AND WHA HAVE I GOT LEFT? I HAVEN'T GO ANYTHING LEFT. IT SCARES ME TO DEATH. - HEY. - DON'T TALK. JUST LISTEN. I PROMISED THE GIRLS A TRIP TO TAOS. WE'LL GO AS SOON AS SCHOOL'S OUT. I WANT DELILAH TO HAVE A BREAK FROM BRAD. SHE CAN TAKE A FRIEND INSTEAD. I'LL FIND A HORSE FOR MICHELE TO RIDE. GRANT'S WILLING TO GIVE I A TRY IN ORANGE COUNTY SHOVELING CEMENT. AND KEVIN WILL ACCOMPANY TODD MAN TO AUSTRALIA. WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY LISTENED TO ME. NOBODY'S LISTENING TO YOU. I JUST WANT EVERYONE ACCOUNTED FOR BEFORE I GO, SO NO ONE'S IN DANGER OF DESERTION. SO NOW GOING TO WORK IS DESERTION TO YOU? I'M GOING AWAY TO GET SOME CLARITY ABOUT WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT ISN'T. I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GET AWAY, PAT. I'M SURE YOU DO. YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO RIDE ALL RIGHT, HUH? - BYE-BYE, LITTLE DARLING. - BYE, DAD. I'M GONNA MISS YOU. I LEFT THE NUMBER OF THE HOUSE WE'RE STAYING AT. I EXPECT YOU TO CALL ME COLLEC AS SOON AS YOU GET TO AUSTRALIA. - ALL RIGHT? - I WILL. - BYE. - WHEN DO YOU COME TO TAOS? OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOU CAN ANSWER ME. - WE'LL FLY UP OVER THE WEEKEND. - NEAT. WHO AM I GONNA TAKE TO THE FIESTA DAY PARADE? OH WELL, I MIGHT BE BACK BY THEN, SO... THE HECK YOU WILL. MOM, YOU SAID THAT IF I REALLY MISSED BRAD THAT I COULD COME BACK. I MADE LUNCH FOR ALL YOU GUYS BY THE POOL. - BYE, GRANT. - BYE. - BYE, KEVIN. - DELILAH. - BYE, DELILAH. - BYE, BRAD. BYE, BRAD. OH, I LOVE YOU, BRAD. NO, RAY DAVIES. I'M TELLING YOU. - RAY DAVIES. - RAY DAVIES? I DON'T LIKE HIM AS MUCH. - "CHANGES" IS GOOD. - "LIFE ON MARS." "LIFE ON MARS" IS GOOD. ALAN, SUSAN, I'M HEADING DOWN TO MY OFFICE IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND IF YOU WAN TO COME ALONG, I'VE GOT SOME PRETTY INTERESTING STUFF COMING DOWN THE PIKE TODAY. THEY'RE FILMING ME BUYING A NEW BUSINESS SUIT, DAD. YEAH, AND THEN BAND PRACTICE. WELL, THAT'S A GOOD DEAL. MAYBE TOMORROW, BILL. HELLO. - CRAIG, IT'S BILL. - Bill... hi. DID THEY GET OFF OKAY? They did, a few hours ago. LISTEN, HOW LONG ARE YOU AROUND FOR? I'M OUT ON A RED-EYE. WHY? I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD DO ME A FAVOR TODAY. WELL, IF IT'S IN MY POWER, SURE. WELL, CRAIG, I HAVE A FRIEND who would like to get into show business. YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. JUST GIVE HER SOME ADVICE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU CAN DO SOMETHING, THAT'D BE GREAT. PERSONALLY I THINK SHE'S A KNOCKOUT. IT'S CLEAR TO YOU I'M NO THAT KIND OF PRODUCER, RIGHT? - BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW THAT. - YEAH. AND PATTY DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT THIS EITHER. I HAVEN'T BEEN AN ANGEL, CRAIG, BUT I'M SURE YOU'VE FIGURED THAT OUT, CONSIDERING ALL THE TIME YOU TWO HAVE BEEN SPENDING TOGETHER. ANYWAY, I LEARNED THE HARD WAY TO BE VERY CAREFUL, KEEP ANY SOUVENIRS THAT MIGH GET HER STARTED OUT OF SIGHT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN "SOUVENIRS"? WELL, YOU KNOW, MATCHBOOKS, SWIZZLE STICKS, PHOTOS-- STUFF TO LOOK BACK ON AND SEE THAT THERE WAS MORE TO THAT BILL LOUD GUY THAN JUST SOME PACK MULE SLAVING AWAY FOR EVERYBODY ELSE'S SHO AT SELF-FULFILLMENT. WELL, LIKE I'VE SAID, EVERY HUSBAND DESERVES A HIDING PLACE. THEY'VE GOT IT FIGURED OUT RIGHT IN EUROPE-- A MAN'S A MAN AND FAMILY'S SACRED. BUT A MAN IN YOUR SITUATION, YOUR MARRIAGE BEING WHAT IT IS, YOU PROBABLY UNDERSTAND THAT MORE THAN ANYBODY. I KNOW I'M SHAPING UP TO BE THE SQUARE OF YOUR SHOW. MAYBE I'VE GOT MORE GOING ON THAN YOU THINK. SALLY IS LIKE A SISTER TO ME. - YEAH. - A BAD SISTER. SO DOESN'T SHE PHOTOGRAPH GREAT, CRAIG? - DON'T YOU THINK? - OH, BILLY, THAT ONE? - VERY LOVELY. - THANKS. YOU KNOW WHAT I TELL HER THE PROBLEM IS? TOO MUCH LIKE BRIGITTE BARDOT. YES. YES, I SEE THAT. DO YOUR THING, YOU KNOW, THE-- - OH BILLY. - GO AHEAD. OKAY. "AND I, OF LADIES MOST DEJEC AND WRETCHED, THAT SUCKED THE HONEY OF HIS MUSIC VOWS, NOW SEE THAT NOBLE AND MOST SOVEREIGN REASON LIKE SWEET BELLS JANGLED OUT OF TUNE AND HARSH, THAT--" YEAH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS, BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT. IT'S OPHELIA. - VERY NICE. - THANK YOU. - SHAKESPEARE. - AH. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, CRAIG? I THINK I MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE THA WOULD BE QUITE INTERESTED IN THESE. SHE'S BOUGHT A HA LIKE PRINCESS MARINA'S  AND HER NEIGHBORS THINK IT SUITS HER A TREAT  BUT SHE HASN' ANY FOOD  IN THE WHOLE LARDER  NOR HAS ANYBODY ELSE  IN THE STREET  BUT SHE SMILES AND YOU'D THINK  SHE WAS WEALTHY  SHE SMILES JUST LIKE A REAL MILLIONAIRE...  - OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T KNOW THERE'S A CAMERA THERE. - MY BROTHER'S SO SHY. ...PRINCESS MARINA  - 'CAUSE SHE DON'T CARE.  - Pat: OH YEAH. LET'S HEAR I FOR LANCE LOUD. - GO LANCE! - I LIKED IT. MOM. PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NO ABOUT TO START WHINING. WELL, YOU SAID THA WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT. AFTER JUST 10 DAYS, DELILAH? MOM, 10 DAYS IN TAOS IS AN ETERNITY. MISS LOUD, MY MOM SAID I CAN TAKE THE BUS BACK IF DELILAH COMES WITH. - HELLO? - WHO IS IT, SWEETIE? HI. MR. GILBERT. DAD SAID THAT WE COULD COME BACK WHENEVER WE WANTED, JUST CALL ANYTIME. HE SAID HE'D HAVE DINNER ON THE TABLE. MOM. FINE. TAKE THE BUS TOMORROW. YES! AT LAST, A GROWNUP TO TALK TO. - HOW'S YOUR TRIP? - Fine. I was kind of hoping that you might turn up here tomorrow. - Why? - FEELING A LITTLE SULTRY, I GUESS. Listen, this is... VERY HARD FOR ME TO DISCUSS. I'VE BEEN DEBATING WHETHER TO CALL OR NOT. But as a friend, I felt that I should. WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG? I saw Bill before I left AND HE TOOK ME FOR A RIDE TO MALIBU to see a friend. WHO? ANDY PLATT? NO NO, NOT ANDY PLATT. HER NAME WAS SALLY. And she gave me an 8x10 glossy AND A TAPE OF HER SINGING "THE SOUND OF MUSIC." LOOK, I CAN FLY OU TO SANTA BARBARA TOMORROW AND YOU CAN MEET ME THERE and we'll talk things through. I understand what you're feeling. I'M STILL RAW FROM MY OWN SITUATION. - Patty. - WE'RE FILMING TOMORROW. WELL, I'M THE PRODUCER. I CAN CHANGE THE SCHEDULE. No. IF SINGING SALLY EVER SEES ME ON TV, I WANT HER TO SEE ME HERE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE. HONESTLY, IF I HEAR ANOTHER ACCORDION, I'M GOING TO VOMIT ALL OVER THIS TABLE. I REALLY AM. I'M SERIOUS, CAN'T YOU ASK YOUR FATHER FOR MORE MONEY? I'M GETTING BORED HERE. BORED IN PARIS-- WHO KNEW THAT WAS POSSIBLE? I ACTUALLY MISS SANTA BARBARA. In Santa Barbara, firefighters continue to battle a wildfire that started in the ridges above Mountain Drive. One home has been lost and many more are threatened. Police and firemen are evacuating residents... OH, MOM, IT'S BURNING AROUND HERE. I'm here alone. I don't know what to do. PUT YOUR FATHER ON THE PHONE. NO, HE'S NOT HERE EITHER. HE DIDN'T SHOW UP. - WHAT? - He called to say THAT HE WAS AWAY ON BUSINESS, BUT HE WOULDN'T SAY WHERE. SON OF A BITCH. LISTEN, GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE. - THE POLICE ARE HERE. - I'm still 10 hours away. OH, MOM, I THINK THE COPS ARE HERE FOR US. GO GO. FOR GOD'S SAKE, GO. MOM! GRANT. - OH BABIES. - MOM. - DELILAH. - MOM, THE ENTIRE HILL WAS BURNING. I WAS SO WORRIED. - WE'RE OKAY. - IT'S OKAY, MOM. I'M FINE. REALLY, IT'S OKAY. - OH MY GOD. - MOM, LANCE IS COMING HOME. WHAT? MY BABIES ARE COMING HOME. A TRUE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. OH MY GOSH. WHO IS THIS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? HI! YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. - I FOUND THIS IN FRANCE. - OH MY GOD. I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE IT. YOU CAN THROW IT ON. YOU CAN WEAR I FOR A CONCERT, JUST TO REALLY SPARK UP SANTA BARBARA AND ALL THAT. HEY, DAD'S HOME. WELL, IT'S THE LONE RANGER. - HI, DAD. - MY WORLD TRAVELER. HI. HOW ARE YOU DOING? YOU LOOK GOOD. OH WAIT, LOOK. I GOT YOU A PRESENT. OH, THANK YOU, LANCE. THAT'S A SHARP-LOOKING TIE THERE, LANCE. - YOU LIKE IT? - IT SURE IS. YEAH. - IT HAS LOTS OF COLORS. - THANK YOU. THAT'S FOR YOU. OOH, WHAT'S THIS, KEMOSABE? $300,000 WORTH OF SHOVEL TEETH. THAT'S MORE THAN WORTH THE WEEKEND IN THE HELL HOLE OF FRESNO, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? WELL, I'M SURE IT WAS HELL, BILL. SAY, ISN'T THIS FIESTA DAY? WHO WANTS TO GO TO THE PARADE? PATTY? WELL, I'M SHOPPING FOR HELEN HARRISON. YOU KNOW, HER HOUSE BURNED DOWN. OH YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT THE FIRE. YEAH, I ALMOST DIED. YOU ALMOST DIED? WOW. WELL, THAT'S AWFUL, BIG D. WHEN I GOT HERE ON WEDNESDAY, THE WHOLE PATIO WAS COVERED IN ASH. IS THAT WHY THAT POOL'S SO GREEN? NO, THAT'S ALGAE. THE POOL MAN LEFT A NOTE. HE COULDN'T GET IN. APPARENTLY YOU LOCKED THE PATIO WHEN YOU WENT TO, UM, FRESNO. BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS, THAT WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO. WELL, I MADE IT BACK FOR FIESTA. HOW ABOUT I FLIP SOME BURGERS FOR THE COMMUNITY BUFFE AT EL PASEO TONIGHT? WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT, BILL? WHY DON' YOU FLIP SOME BURGERS FOR THE BUFFET? I'M SURE THE CREW WOULD LOVE TO GET A NICE SHOT OF THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE SAD TRUTH IS? THE KIDS ADORE THEIR DADDY. EVEN LANCE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. BUT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE HE LOST THE LINK TO ANYTHING THAT'S REAL-- TO ME, TO THEM, TO HIS HOME. AND I'VE FINALLY GIVEN UP ON PULLING HIM BACK. ARE YOU HUNGRY? WOW, THE MENU HASN'T CHANGED. OH, YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. I ACTUALLY-- I PICKED UP A MAN IN THAT BAR ONCE. REALLY? WELL, I'M ASTONISHED. WHAT, THAT I COULD DO SUCH A THING? NO, THAT YOU WOULD TELL ME. BACK WHEN I CAUGHT BILL RUNNING AROUND, HE KEPT GOING ON AND ON ABOUT AN OPEN MARRIAGE. I GUESS I WAS ALREADY IN ONE, JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT. ANYWAY, HE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED ME TO PARTICIPATE. I GAVE IT A TRY. IT WASN'T FOR ME. AND THEN I-- I GAVE HIM AN ULTIMATUM. I THINK THAT MEN HANDLE AGING DIFFERENTLY THAN WOMEN. ALAN, ALAN, ALAN, ALAN, ALAN. READY? HERE WE GO. - WOW. - NO NO, WAIT. CUT. ROLL AGAIN. HERE WE GO. READY? ALAN, READY? ALAN, READY? LANCE, ARE YOU SEEING THIS? WHERE'S PATTY? SHE LOVES THIS. AH, THERE SHE IS. SHE CERTAINLY ISN' WINNING ANY POINTS FOR ELEGANCE NOW, IS SHE? YOU'D THINK I'D BE HAPPY SHE'S NO BEAUTY QUEEN. SOMEHOW IT JUST MAKES IT ALL A LITTLE WORSE. DID I DO THE WRONG THING SHOWING IT TO YOU? NO, I-- I'VE BUILT AN ENTIRE LIFE LOOKING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. I THINK IT'S TIME I LOOKED THEM IN THE EYE. WELL, THERE'S MORE TO TELL IF YOU'RE READY TO HEAR IT. I'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR THAT TAPE OF HER SINGING. NO, YOU WOULDN'T. I COULD REALLY USE A LAUGH. WELL, ALL RIGHT. IT'S UP IN MY ROOM. I'LL GO GET IT. WAIT, I'LL GO WITH YOU. - REALLY? - WELL, WHY NOT? I'M USED TO RAISING EYEBROWS IN THIS PLACE. ALL RIGHT. DID YOU READ THAT LAST ONE? YOU DIDN'T READ THAT LAST ONE, DID YOU? KAY, I INSIS YOU SIT RIGHT HERE. VIVA LA FIESTA, PATRICIA. I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO SAY IT, KAY, BUT I ENVIED YOUR HUSBAND FROM THE MOMENT WE MET. AND I PITIED YOUR WIFE. OH, SHE'S ALWAYS MAD AT ME, KAY. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY. I'M AT A DANGEROUS AGE. - ARE YOU GETTING THIS? - UNBELIEVABLE. TELL JERRY I HOPE HE FEELS BETTER. PAN RIGHT AND PREPARE TO SHIT YOUR PANTS. WHAT THE HELL DOES HE THINK HE'S DOING? - SOMETHING TO EAT? - SOME STEAKS. - RARE? - THANK YOU. KEEP IT COMING. THANK YOU, SENOR. HEY, DARLING, I SAVED THIS SPACE JUST FOR YOU. HERE, USE THIS. OH, THERE YOU ARE. WHAT'S THAT FOR? - HER PHONE NUMBER. - THERE YOU GO AGAIN. OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE-- CECIL B. DeMILLE. WELCOME TO FIESTA, MR. DeMILLE. - VIVA LA FIESTA, BILL. - VIVA LA FIESTA. CRAIG, YOU CAN'T BE IN THE SHOT. JUST FRAME ME OUT. PATTY AND I HAD A LONG TALK AND SHE WANTS ME HERE. - WHAT FOR? - MORAL SUPPORT. PUT THAT THING ON YOUR SHOULDER AND SHOOT. - WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN? - GETTING A DRINK. GETTING A DRINK? AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'M PRETTY DAMN HAPPY RIGHT NOW. JUST A BARREL OF LAUGHS, HUH, PATTY? - BECAUSE LIFE WITH YOU IS A SAD COMEDY. - WHAT? I'M JUST SORRY THAT EVERYBODY REALLY HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS RIDICULOUS, CLOWN-LIKE CIRCUS. YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE FUN, PATRICIA-- THE FIRS ON THE DANCE FLOOR AND THE LAS TO LEAVE THE PARTY. I THINK YOU MIGHT BE CONFUSING ME WITH SOMEBODY ELSE, BILL. NO, THAT WAS YOU UNTIL YOU TURNED INTO THIS. WHAT DID I TURN INTO, BILL? SOMEONE THAT LIVES TO PUT ME DOWN, BRING ME DOWN. AH, WELL, I DON'T SEEM TO BE DOING VERY WELL AT THAT. YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE TODAY, THAT'S FOR SURE. IN FACT, I THINK I'M GONNA SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE. WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT? I THINK SHE'S OVER THERE SOMEWHERE. SAVE YOU FROM HAVING TO SNOOP AROUND MY CLOSET AND OPEN MY DRAWERS. SEND ME TO THE ELECTRIC CHAIR FOR TRYING TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN LIKE I'M HAVING TODAY BECAUSE I'M MARRIED TO A DOWNER. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, PATTY? I THINK YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT. I THINK YOU ARE A PATHETIC FOOL, SAD, LUDICROUS, - IDIOTIC, INCOMPREHENSIBLE. - WHAT ELSE? SCHIZOPHRENIC, SADOMASOCHISTIC-- GIVE ME THAT PEN. I WANT TO WRITE THIS DOWN, PATTY. THIS IS IMPORTANT STUFF. WELL, DON'T LEAVE OU GODDAMN ASSHOLE! THAT'S IT. WE'RE DONE. WE'RE LEAVING. VERY GOOD. WHAT WAS THAT? SCHIZOPHRENIC? DO YOU KNOW HOW TO SPELL THAT, PAT? ALAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? TECHNICAL PROBLEMS, CRAIG. ALL RIGHT, WELL, GET THE SECOND CAMERA. WE'RE OUT OF FILM. THAT'S BULLSHIT. - GET BACK IN THERE. - WHOA WHOA. THIS IS WHA WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. THE BEST STUFF IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. SUSAN AND I HAVE ESTABLISHED A TRUST WITH THIS FAMILY, CRAIG. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? WE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM DESTROYED BY YOUR FILM. THEY'RE DESTROYING THEMSELVES. THEY'VE BEEN DESTROYING THEMSELVES LONG BEFORE WE GOT HERE AND THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT SHY ABOUT IT. THEY FORGOT WE WERE EVEN THERE, MAN! THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT, ISN'T IT? THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. WE'RE FINALLY SUCCESSFUL AND YOU'RE FUCKING IT ALL UP. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM? I DO. I CARE ABOUT ALL OF THEM. BUT THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER PICTURE HERE THAT YOU DON' EVEN UNDERSTAND. ONLY TO YOU, CRAIG. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK, ALAN? I THINK YOU SAW SOMETHING IN THERE THAT TERRIFIED YOU. AND IF I WERE YOU, SUSAN, I'D BE VERY WORRIED. - THAT'S IT! - WHOA WHOA WHOA. - ALAN! GUYS! - SON OF A BITCH! - ALAN, COME ON. - ARE YOU OKAY? CONGRATULATIONS, TOMMY. YOU JUST GOT YOUR BOSS'S JOB. PICK UP THE CAMERA AND LET'S GO BACK INSIDE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S MY EQUIPMENT. - ALL RIGHT, CALL THE POLICE. GO, CALL THE POLICE. - REALLY, CRAIG? YOU WANT US TO SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT YOUR DOCUMENTARY TECHNIQUE, ABOUT HOW YOU OVERSTEP ALL ACCEPTABLE BOUNDARIES? - DO YOU NEED HELP, MRS. LOUD? - OH. YES, MY HUSBAND SENT ME FOR SOMETHING HE FORGOT. HELLO. I'M DOING IT-- LEAVING HIM. And I want to do it on camera. THAT'S WHA YOU WANT TOO, ISN'T IT, AFTER ALL, CRAIG? PATTY, I WOULD NEVER ASK YOU TO DO THAT. BUT NOT TELLING THE CHILDREN-- I NEED TO DO THAT ALONE. AND MY BROTHER ALONE TOO. No cameras. BUT BILL-- YOU CAN FILM THAT, BABY-- ME TELLING HIM TO GO TO HELL, NEVER COME BACK. I WANT THE WOMEN OF AMERICA TO SEE THAT. THAT'S WHAT I WAN HIS BIMBOS TO SEE. ALL RIGHT, PATTY, WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT THIS. Not you. JUST ME AND BILL AND ALAN AND SUSAN, NO ONE ELSE. All right. Whatever you wish. WAY OVER YONDER...  THE HARDEST THING THAT I CAN THINK OF IN LIFE IS DISAPPOINTING THE PEOPLE THAT I LOVE THE MOS IN THE WHOLE WORLD. AND I'M ABOU TO DO THAT. DIVORCED? WE CAN'T GET DIVORCED. WE'RE THE AMERICAN FAMILY. I'LL GO TO GLENDALE IN THE MORNING AND SPEAK WITH UNCLE TOM AND AUNT YVONNE FIRST. AND... I'LL TELL YOUR DAD TOMORROW NIGH WHEN HE COMES HOME. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, SWEETIE. MOM. WAY OVER YONDER  THAT'S WHERE I'M BOUND.  WHAT THE HELL? TOM? ALAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M LOADING THE MAG. WHY? WE'RE NOT FILMING WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. CRAIG CALLED ME. HE TOLD YOU APPROVED THIS. CRAIG'S HERE? OH, YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE! I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET, BUT LET'S HAVE A DRINK AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT. HERE. - YOU GAVE YOUR WORD. - JUST LET ME EXPLAIN. - I SAID NO FILMING HERE. - JUST HEAR ME OUT, PLEASE. NO, YOU HEAR ME OUT! THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO DO, IS HEAR YOU OU IN YOUR OWN WORDS, SPOKEN TO PEOPLE WHO WON' INTERRUPT YOU OR ARGUE WITH YOU OR SHUT YOU DOWN OR WALK OUT WITHOUT LISTENING, BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT BILL'S GOING TO DO WHEN YOU GIVE HIM HIS WALKING PAPERS. AND THEN NO ONE WILL KNOW ABOUT ALL THE YEARS OF LIES AND HUMILIATIONS AND BETRAYALS THAT BROUGHT YOU TO THIS. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE FANCY WORDS ABOUT THE THRESHOLD OF PRIVACY, HUH? IT HAS TO BE CROSSED. IT HAS TO BE CROSSED RIGHT NOW FOR THIS FILM TO HAVE ANY KIND OF EMOTIONAL IMPACT. THEN GO MAKE A GODDAMN LASSIE MOVIE! THERE'S REAL SUFFERING HAPPENING HERE, CRAIG. YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN MY KIDS LAST NIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. I SHOULD'VE SEEN YOUR KIDS. AND THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD'VE SEEN YOUR KIDS. AND FRANKLY, WITHOUT THA AND WITHOUT THIS, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS THING IS WORTH PUTTING ON THE AIR. - THAT'S FINE BY ME. - REALLY? WHAT ABOUT ALAN AND SUSAN AND TOMMY WHO'VE WORKED 24 HOURS A DAY FOR THE LAST GOD KNOWS HOW MANY MONTHS? OR ALL THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK WHO YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOU WHO'VE BEEN SIFTING THROUGH MORE FOOTAGE THAN WAS EVER SHO FOR WORLD WAR II? AND THE MILLION DOLLARS THE NETWORK HAS SPEN BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN YOU? NOT ME, YOU-- YOU AND YOUR STORY AND YOUR ABILITY TO EXPRESS IT. WHAT ABOUT YOUR SONS WHO THINK THAT THIS FILM CAN CHANGE THEIR LIFE? AND THEY'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. AND ALL THE WOMEN-- ALL THE WOMEN WHO ARE OUT THERE WHO ARE IN THE SAME POSITION AS YOU ARE RIGHT NOW, BUT THEY'RE ALONE AND THEY'RE LOST AND THEY'RE SCARED AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHA TO DO AND YOU CAN SHOW THEM. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. LET'S NOT PUT IT ON THE AIR. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU LISTEN TO ME. LIKE I TOLD YOU BEFORE, NOT YOU! JUST SUSAN AND ALAN. WHEN BILL WOULD GO AWAY, I WAS JUST LEFT AT HOME WITH MY OWN WORST FEARS. UNRETURNED PHONE CALLS, LATE-NIGHT HANG-UPS-- IT ALL JUST MADE ME SO PARANOID. THAT BLISSFUL DELUSION OF FAITHFULNESS, THAT NEED TO BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY-- IT DIED THE NIGH OF THE FILES. LIFE DOESN'T GO ON THE WAY YOU PLAN IT. WHEN YOU REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT, YOU JUST BECOME THIS UNLOVABLE PERSON. I'VE MADE MISTAKES-- A LOT OF THEM. I THOUGHT IF BILL COULDN' LIVE UP TO THE TRUTH, AT LEAST HE COULD LIVE UP TO THE FACADE. HOW DID THE KIDS TAKE ALL OF THIS? HARD. YOU KNOW WHO TOOK I THE HARDEST OF ALL, DON'T YOU? LANCE? HE'S THE ONE HE UNDERSTOOD THE LEAST. HEY. I'M CUTTING. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? LISTEN, I KNOW THAT WASN'T EASY. COME ON. ACTUALLY, I THINK IT WAS MY BEST SCENE. PATTY, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET. BUT AFTER TONIGHT, THE HARD PART IS OVER. WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. LET'S GO. COME ON. COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO GE TO THE HOUSE BEFORE BILL. COME ON! BARBARA, IT'S PATTY. LISTEN, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. YOU NEED TO TELL BILL NOT TO COME HOME TONIGHT. I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT SOMETHING AND I DON' WANT HIM HOME. HEY, MAN, YOUR MOM. GRANT, HONEY, CAN I TALK TO YOU? EXCUSE US. I NEED YOU TO BE THE ONE TO TELL YOUR FATHER. - WHAT? - I KNOW. HOW CAN YOU ASK ME TO DO THAT, MOM? HOPEFULLY BARBARA WILL HAVE GOTTEN TO HIM IN TIME AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING, SWEETIE. BUT IF SHE HASN'T-- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY TO HIM? THE TRUTH. TELL HIM THAT I'M TELLING HIM TO MOVE OUT AND THAT I-- I DON'T WANT TO HUMILIATE HIM IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA, HONEY. YOU'LL BE DOING YOUR FATHER A FAVOR THAT HE'LL NEVER FORGET. SOMEBODY HOLDS THE KEY  BUT I CAN'T FIND MY WAY HOME  STILL I CAN' FIND MY WAY HOME  AND I AIN'T DONE NOTHING WRONG...  MY BIG MAN'S BEEN HAULING CONCRETE FOR A LIVING, - YEAH. - STRONG AS AN OX. HAS YOUR MOTHER BEEN DRIVING THE MERCEDES? GRANT? UH, THE MERCEDES. YEAH. YES. DID YOU TALK TO YOUR SECRETARY TODAY? NO, I HAVEN'T. WHY? NOTHING. I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW EVERYTHING WAS GOING AT THE OFFICE. I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER ASKED ME THAT BEFORE. IT MUST BE BECAUSE YOU'RE EARNING YOUR KEEP THIS SUMMER. NOW YOU CAN APPRECIATE WHAT IT TAKES TO BRING HOME A BUCK OR TWO. I SOMETIMES WONDER IF YOUR MOTHER HAD TO WORK WHETHER SHE'D HAVE MORE APPRECIATION FOR THE OLD MAN. HOW'S SHE DOING, BY THE WAY? MOM? SHE'S GOOD. YOU KNOW MOM. I SURE DO. I SURE DO. The changing  Of sunlight  To moonlight  Reflections of my life  Oh, how they fill my eyes...  Nixon devalued the dollar today. Did you know that? WELL, IT'S LIT UP LIKE CHRISTMAS IN HERE. HOW ARE YOU DOING? YOU ALL RIGHT? - I WASN'T EXPECTING TO SEE YOU. - WHY NOT? COME ON, BILL. WE BOTH KNOW. - KNOW WHAT? - YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM? DIDN'T YOU GET A CALL FROM BARBARA? I DIDN'T TALK TO HER TODAY. DIDN'T GRAN SAY ANYTHING? GRANT? ABOUT WHAT? - BIG D! - HI, DAD. - OH. - IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. AT LEAST SOMEBODY IS GLAD TO SEE ME COME HOME. NOW WHAT'S THIS ABOU BARBARA NOW? WHAT DID--? BILL, DON'T YOU KNOW? WHAT? DON'T BE PLAYING WITH ME, BILL. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU DON'T KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM? NO. WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? WHAT--? WELL, THIS IS KEEN. UH, LOOK, LET'S NO SPILL ANY BLOOD HERE. I'VE BEEN TO SEE A LAWYER. THIS IS HIS CARD. YOU CAN GIVE HIM A CALL TOMORROW. OH. I WANT YOU TO MOVE OUT-- TONIGHT, NOW. JUST TURN AROUND AND GET OUT. REALLY? WE'RE DONE, BILL. THE MARRIAGE IS OVER. - JUST LIKE THAT? - JUST LIKE THAT. JUST LIKE THAT. JUST LIKE THAT. WELL, FAIR DEAL. I FIGURED YOU'D THINK THAT. WELL, I THINK THA IT'S A LITTLE-- A LITTLE SHORTSIGHTED ON YOUR PART. - DO YOU, BILL? - I REALLY DO. WELL, AT LEAS YOU DIDN'T PICK THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONE. HE'LL BE IN HIS OFFICE TOMORROW, EXPECTING A CALL FROM YOU. I'VE BEEN TO THE BANK, MADE COPIES OF OUR TAX FORMS. RIGHT. AND YOU'VE GO THE KIDS PRETTY SHAPED UP, HAVE YOU? THEY ALL UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM, THAT IT'S ONLY BETWEEN US. WELL, I GUESS I DON' HAVE TO UNPACK NOW, DO I? HEY, GUYS. HOW ARE WE DOING IN HERE, BIG D? NOT SO GOOD, DAD. NONE OF US ARE. YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW THE NUMBER TO THE LEMON TREE, DO YOU? THEY ALREADY HAVE A ROOM FOR YOU. OH. THAT'S HANDY. I HAVE TO GO, DAD. - WELL, STAY IN TOUCH NOW. - YEAH. - HONEY. - YEAH? WE'RE ALL GONNA BE FINE. BYE, DAD. PATTY... IF GLEN BERNSON CALLS ME, MAKE SURE HE CALLS ME AT THE LEMON TREE. WE'VE GOT A HUGE ORDER IN DAYTON. AND MERRIWETHER-- YOU REMEMBER HIM-- HE'S GOING TO TRY TO SELL BERNSON THE SAME DAMN THING, AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT HAPPEN. WE REALLY CAN'T. ANOTHER ONE. - LANCE? - LANCE. - JUST A SECOND. - LANCE, CAN I GET A PICTURE? - THANK YOU. - ONE MORE, PLEASE. WOW, LOOKS LIKE IT'S A HIT ALREADY. WELCOME TO TONIGHT'S PREMIERE SCREENING. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PRODUCER AND CREATOR OF "AN AMERICAN FAMILY," THE AWARD-WINNING FILMMAKER CRAIG GILBERT. THANK YOU AND WELCOME TO EPISODE ONE OF "AN AMERICAN FAMILY." - CAMERON, LOOK AT THIS. - BEFORE WE BEGIN, I WOULD BE REMISS IN NOT THANKING THE LOUDS. - YOU SEE THIS? - THEIR COURAGE STILL INSPIRES ME AND THEIR TRUS HUMBLES ME. SO WITHOU FURTHER ADO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, "AN AMERICAN FAMILY." Six, five, four, three... It's another New Year's Eve for the Loud family. But this year will be much different. For the very first time, Pat and her husband Bill are living separately after 20 years of marriage... "PATTY LOUD SEES NO WAY OUT OF A FALSE MARRIAGE EXCEPT BOOZE." - Please, Lance. - HOLD ON, LISTEN TO THIS. "LANCE OOZES HIS LEECH-LIKE HOMOSEXUALITY WITH THE GLEE OF A GROTESQUE, GOYA-ESQUE EMOTIONAL DWARF." WHAT? NO NO NO. OH MY GOD. Oh my God, what have I done? I NEVER WANT TO SEE THAT MAN AGAIN. MOM, I'M-- I'M COMING HOME. AND WE'RE GONNA WATCH THE SHOW WHEN IT AIRS TOGETHER, ALL OF US, ALL OF US AS A FAMILY. They are an American family, the family next door on the surface. 10 million viewers watch them every week on the most popular, most watched series that educational television has ever tackled. And those 10 million people have heard the Louds say things that many people wouldn't tell their lovers or tax accountants. You are a pathetic fool. Why don't we discuss this later? You don't know there's a problem? No. What's your problem? I've been to see a lawyer. This is his card. You can give him a call tomorrow. I want you to move out. It's a West-coast bourgeois all-American freefall. There is a tremendous amount wrong with this family and very little right. I for one view them as a true American tragedy. But they have one child who has not turned out well. What they didn't realize is that people were not going to look at it as an art form, that they were going to begin criticizing them as people. People dissected this family in order to call into question not only an American family, but the American family. ...role as a father, but that that role was of a pal. Have you seen Lance Loud and that get-up? Here was a family with very serious problems. Is there or is there not such a thing as a sense of shame? It's just-- it's shocking. And I wouldn't want anybody... SO SENSATIONALISM WAS HIS GOAL FROM THE GET-GO. IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. HE WANTED TO CREATE A SUCCESSFUL SHOW, BUT HE WAS ALSO ON A PERSONAL MISSION. COULD THAT EXPLAIN WHAT WENT WRONG? CRAIG DIDN'T SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT FAMILY. HE SEARCHED FOR THE FAMILY THAT WAS PERFECT FOR HIS AGENDA. ANYBODY WANT PIZZA? - PIZZA? - OH MY GOD, I'M AFRAID TO ANSWER IT. - HELLO? - HAVE YOU READ THIS STUFF, PATTY? - IT'S YOUR FATHER. - Get this-- "The father, COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH ANY WORLD EXCEPT THE FALSE ONE HE INHABITS, REACHES OUT..." WHY DON'T WE INVITE YOUR DAD TO PIZZA? HMM? WELL, WE ARE A CULTURAL PHENOMENON AND THE MOST DESPISED FAMILY IN AMERICA. IT'S REALLY ALL TOO GLAMOROUS TO HANDLE. REALLY. HONESTLY. I DON'T WAN TO BE DESPISED. WELL, THEN WE'LL JUS HAVE TO FIGHT BACK. WON'T WE, SWEETHEART? "The Dick Cavett Show!" WE'RE DOING THIS SHOW AND A DOZEN OTHERS LIKE I BECAUSE WE WAN PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT WE ARE NO MONSTERS OR IDIOTS. WE'RE PRETTY DECENT PEOPLE AND DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WERE SIGNING UP FOR. WE'VE LOST DIGNITY, AND-- AND-- AND WE'VE BEEN HUMILIATED AS A RESULT OF IT. OUR HONOR IS AT QUESTION AND I FEEL VERY DEFENSIVE, AS CRAIG BROUGHT UP. PEOPLE HAVE A MUCH DIFFEREN IMAGE OF THEMSELVES THAN SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE HAVE OF THEM. I THINK WE'RE MOST HORRIFIED BY THE THINGS IN OURSELVES THAT WE'RE SCARED OF. - WHEN I SAW MYSELF BILLED AS "HOMO OF THE YEAR 1971..." ...I WAS REALLY DESPONDENT FOR A WHILE. BUT I KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING TO COME OFF AS ANYWAY. THEY'VE SORT OF CATEGORIZED US. ONE THING IS THAT YOU BECOME OBLIGED UNDER THAT CAMERA TO REACT IN SOME WAY. YOU TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME PLATO-LIKE DECISION WHEN THE CAMERA'S ROLLING. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, ANYBODY WHO'S IN SHOW BUSINESS WOULD HAVE TO CALL YOU NAIVE TO THINK THAT YOU COULD THINK THAT YOU COULD APPEAR ON TELEVISION AND NOT HAVE I SELECTED, EDITED. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH BEING NAIVE. I SEE SOMETHING REALLY WRONG WITH BEING SOPHISTICATED. CERTAINLY NO OTHER AMERICAN FAMILY HAS BEEN THOUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND BEING SO OUTSPOKEN AND ACCESSIBLE. AND WE WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT. TO THE LOUDS AND OUR 14th MINUTE OF FAME. GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY. LET'S MILK OUR LAST MINUTE FOR ALL THAT IT'S WORTH. YEAH.
