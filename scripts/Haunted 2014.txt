I mean, she wants to be private, can't it be out in the sunshine or under a tree somewhere? Telling you, she never goes out. In all the years I've been here, I've never even seen here in the visitors' room. Look, she's my mom. I... I haven't talked to her in years. Yeah, she did get made up today just to see you. Look, you get her to go out, I'll be happy to take you. Ms. Di Santo? Your boy's here. What have you got her on? She hasn't been medicated today. Bang on the door when you're done. Hey. You can look at me. I'm not sure I can. Yes you can. Mm. Look at me. Oh my. You look like him. Why would you say that? You said you didn't remember him. You said it was like trying to remember a dream. You said you didn't know who he was. Do you know who my father is? What else do you know, Mom? Mother! Mom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Mom... No, no, no... I won't. Don't, don't. I won't. Stop... Mom... look, I'm not... I'm not gonna touch you, OK? I won't. Then don't. Do you... do you want me to get the orderly? You want your medication or something? I'm supposed to tell you about your father. And today is the day that I promised I would. Wait, you prom... you promised who? The things in the wall. They listen all the time, and then they tell me what to do. And Nicky, today is the day that they told me I had to tell you about him. I'm... I'm not... I won't. I'm warning you. Oh, Nicky. Hey! He's coming for you. Hey! Please... Open the fucking door! Your father... I only remember a nightmare! So what did she want to say? She wanted to let me know that she's still crazy. So no birthday present, huh? Let's go find one. Let's go drink one. Go, go, go. Yeah, come on. That's the guy, right over there. Can I buy you guys a beer? Why? Is that Nick Di Santo? What if it is? You know him? What if I do? Can he do it? You know what? I don't care. That is not what I said and that is not what you said. Hey, uh, hit me again. You know what? I'm through. Yeah. No, I'm done. I'm hanging up. You got a number for a cab? Anything I can do? Bet I got you beat. For worst day ever. There's no way you could beat this one. What, did your dog die or something? Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Yeah, 23's kind of a big one. You don't know? Um, it takes 23 seconds for blood to circulate throughout the human body. In every person are 23 pairs of chromosomes. And every 23rd wave that comes to shore is twice as long and twice as strong as the one that came before it. So 23 is kind of like this, um, magic number. I like 23. How about you do it, just one time? I... I just... I want to know if you can really do it. Hey, what'd I say? Do what? What are you doing? Nick. Don't... no. Relax. Are you trying to scare away the first girl that doesn't think you're Frankenstein? Well, if she's the one, she won't run. Do not do this. Please. If you were sober, you wouldn't do this. Hey, uh, Ronny says he'll do it. Just go up there. Go put your hand on him. Touch him. What? No, look, it doesn't work that way. I have to touch them. That's rule one. You can touch me all you want, but it's not gonna work. And rule two? It has to be something bad, something really bad, or I do not see you. There's no way to change it. There's no information on why or when or how... I just see it. Could somebody just tell me what everybody's talking about? Sometimes he can touch somebody and he can see how they're going to die. Seriously? Hold up your hand. Nick, please. Please, just sit down. Aaaahhhh! Gotcha. Whoa! Whoa, man! What just happened? Come on, man, look at me. Nicky! Are you kidding me? Just get out of here! No, no, no. What was that? Did you see... did you see something? You just couldn't leave it alone. No! I want to know! Did you see something? Dude, come on. Did you fucking... No, I want to know. What happened? Shut the fuck up, Nicky. Ryo! Shut up, Nicky. I don't want to get my ass kicked tonight. Ryo, look, man. What? I'm holding the lady's hand. And what? And everything's OK. You didn't tell him? I... I can't understand you. What did you do? I did everything. You were supposed to tell him about me. I did everything you asked... Excuse me? What? I was just saying I should pick up girls at a bar more often. Uh, news flash... I picked you up. Oh, no, no. I do not think so. No, I know so. Really? "I'm holding the lady's hand"? That was your pick-up line? Do you really see things when you touch some people? Bad things? You're gonna hear some stuff about me. You're gonna hear that I moved from foster home to foster home since I was nine. And you're gonna hear that it was because my mom committed herself when I was eight. That's a long scar. How'd you get it? When I was seven, I, um, I thought if I, uh, hurt my hands, they wouldn't hurt me. Nicky! What the fuck, man? Check out the "24 Hour News." Several area firefighters have joined the right, and more are expected. Again, we have no confirmation on what started the blaze, but speculation aside, as this dramatic footage shows, most of the facilities residents caught sleeping on the second and third floors had little chance of escape. Though the number is still rising, the body count is already at 74, and the firefighters expect to battle the blaze through the night, with fire departments from as far west as Pomo and Wheaton County expected to arrive on the scene at any moment. The building has a long and colorful history and was one of the oldest... No, I... I... yes, of course. Yes, I understand. You can count on me. You've always been able to count on me. Right. Nick? Come on in. Just finishing up a phone call. I'm Judge Bing. Have a seat. Is it necessary to go over the details of your mother's death? Uh, no. No, I know how my mother died, Mr. Bing. Respect Look, it's been eight months. I didn't even know she had a will. And are you aware that there is a lawsuit pending against the institution? I have no interest in suing anyone. Well, I thought you might be particularly keen on that now. Given recent unplanned developments? Life is full of surprises, Nick. This is the reading of the will, right? And there's no one else here? In accordance with your mother's wishes, you alone are to be here when I give you this. I'm sorry to say this is all she left. I mean, well, what is all this? Per her instructions, I have no knowledge of the content. So if there's any way I can help once you've been through it all, anything you need, don't hesitate to call. He has it. And unless I miss my guess, he's already found it. How'd it go? Stay there. I'm coming to you. That file's from her attorney. It's, uh, papers and old pictures. And? What? Come on, just sit down. I want to show you something. Are you rich? Here. You see it? See what? The house. Does that look familiar? Should it? Look, OK, guys, this house is not some ordinary house. This house and me go way back. It's in all of my sketchbooks, in every story I wrote as a kid, and in just about every class where they ever let me draw something. Look, I've been drawing this house since I could pick up a crayon. Look at this. Same house. You see this circular window at the top? Yeah. I mean, look at this. Same house. Age 12. I mean, come on. Look at all of these. So you liked to draw the same house when you were a kid. Come on. Come here, come here. I need... get up. Come here. Come on, get up. I just want to sit down. Get up, come on. I gotta show you something, Eve. You're gonna freak out about this. Ryo, come here, look at this. This house has been in my head all my life. OK, so you used to draw it. Why are you acting all psycho? Look, Ryo, I'm still drawing it. Look, this house, maybe the reason I started to think about architecture in the first place. So you have a tiny boner for old houses with little round windows. What the hell difference does that make? Ryo, up until about an hour ago, I didn't know this house existed in the real world. So what? You think this has something to do with your dad? Nicky, even if it does exist, what about it? I own it. Yeah. The directions in the will had the house in town on this road. There's no sign a town was ever here. This baby is sailing, man. You did a lot of work on it. How are we supposed to find a house without a street address? Hey, babe, how you feeling? Can we please just find a place that has a bathroom? I can't find a town or even a bowling alley called River's End. Oh my god, that dog has three legs. So? So don't order any meat. That's quite a set of wheels. Thank you. It was my granddad's. Bathroom? Down the hall, past the cigarette machine. Hey. River's End, this... this is it. Ryo, look. Holy shit. Look! Look at this! This house, we're looking for it. Are you all those folks that came through this morning? That van had a state logo on it, Knoxie. This place? I own it. You own Wormwood? Wormwood? That's the name of the house? Yeah, after the flood washed it away. You know, food for the worms? You've never heard of the Blackwater flood? 20-something years ago? It was the end, all right. There is no River's End. Washed away, all of it. Town doesn't exist anymore... same as your house. Unless you like old wives' tales. Well, yeah, I might like them. Don't shovel that shit to these kids, Lucky. There's one story that says that house is still standing. Story says the flood hit that house hard, but it didn't take it down. Couldn't take it down. Just washed it from here all the way down to here somewhere. If you believe stories for idiots and morons. You got some kind of deed? 'Cause you're about 23 years too late. What? Nicky. That house isn't the only way to find out about your father or anyone else. Hey. That's weird. Yeah, like "Texas Chainsaw" weird. Aughhh! Look out! Hey. You all right? Hey. Yeah. You guys all right? You came out of nowhere, man. Sorry. You OK? You OK? That was close. Is everybody all right? Yeah. I am so sorry. We haven't seen any other cars out here all day. I'm Chris. I'm Sam. That's Lillith. Hello. That your van? Yeah, PLS. Public Land and Survey? We're out here mapping the valley for the state. Yeah, what are you doing out here? Well, we were looking for a house, till we found out that it got washed down a ridge. Wormwood? House that washed into the valley during the flood? Yeah. You guys think you know something about that? Yeah, if you believe in urban myths. This is Wormwood, huh? Sam? Yeah, boss? What she said. We should just keep one foot in reality here. Any house, even if it survived being ripped off its foundation, would break into kindling, crashing through trees. Well, look, if there's any part of it around here, like a... a floorboard or a roof shingle... anything... I'd like to see it. Um, I'm telling you, it's an urban myth. Get in your car. Follow me. Hey, wait, wait, wait. Aagghh! Mmph! Nicky, Nicky. Is he OK? Yes, he's OK. He's OK. He just... he gets dizzy spells when he thinks too fast. Nick? Look at me. How about you get back in the car and sit down, OK? What do you mean? It's a long shot, but we mapped something a few days ago that I think you need to see. This is the old highway where the flood took it out. See this path through the forest? Something big definitely came through here. Yeah, it's called a flood. No. Look at the sway of these trees. It's way above the flood line. Come on, Chris, there's ravines like this throughout the county. Thanks, Sam. But on this team, I'm the arboriculturalist. God, not that word again. He likes to say that 'cause he thinks it sounds dirty. No, wait, so you're a tree guy, right? Nicky, Nicky. Baby, come back up here with me, OK? Yeah, come on, Nick, why don't you, huh? Baby, now. Please? What? At least one house came through here. It's, uh, it's a long shot. But we could all go for a quick little hike. He said it was a long shot, Nicky. A shot's still a shot, Evie. Come on. You gonna be OK here if I... if I take a quick look? I'm not hiking, if that's what you mean. It's only gonna be a few minutes. Ryo, can you stay here with her? Please? All right? Come on, Sam, I know you want to come. Yeah, I'm only going to see your face when all you find is poison ivy and a couple of humping beavers. Lil? Ooh, thanks, but uh, I think I'll stay with Eve. That's a great idea. I'm leaving in the van if you guys aren't back here in 10 minutes. And I'm taking Eve with me. Eve. I love you. See how the slip plane moves across? This isn't just from the water. It is... So I just follow where the trees are clear? Yeah, exactly. Nick! Nicky, slow down! Nicky! Nicky! Come on! We're gonna get lost out here. You gonna be OK? We gotta get back. Little window. Right, Nicky? Little round window at the top? What the hell are we looking at? This is wrong. Come on, this is wrong. It should have been pulverized. This can't be the same house. Oh, yeah? Then what is it? That's not even from this house. You gonna tell me this whole place just crashed here, perfectly level? Well, maybe someone leveled it. I think a lot of big stuff must have washed through here. And when the house did, I think that's the tree that finally stopped it. I just got this really weird feeling, Ryan. I drew this. I dreamed this. And now I'm standing in front of it, like I'm the reason it's here. Like it's holding on, just for me. Stop right there. Now turn around and walk away. Look, don't get the wrong idea. We're, uh, Public Land and Survey. I'm Sam. I know who you are, Sammael. Heh. It... it's Sam. You with the state, too? No. I'm with... Look, if we ended up somewhere we shouldn't be, we apologize, Mister...? My name's Seth. That's all you need to know. And let me tell you something else, Sammael. It's Sam. I don't know what you think you're doing here, or what claim you think you have to this house... We're just mapping the valley. But if this is about eminent domain or any of that state bullshit... It's a geodesic survey. We don't care about this house. Make no mistake. I've been swinging a hammer in it since before you were born. I've been working this place forever. And I'm here to stay. We don't want any trouble. Then you best be on your way. I th... I think you're probably right. Wait. The people that lived here. Do you know anything about them? No, Nicky. The man who used to live here 20 years ago. What about him? I just want to know his name. No. No you don't. Look, this house is in my mother's will. These people might be my family. I have the deed. I don't care what you have. What you came looking for isn't here. You do not know what I came looking for. Just you. Not your buddy. And no one from the state. You want to see this house you think is yours? Come on. What, do you think he's a fucking realtor? Look at him. Nick! Your old man's not in there! I drew this house when I was a kid. God, it had all of this in it. Every room, upstairs. Downstairs. What is that? What's in the walls? Rats? That's abhorrent. That's the tree at the side of the house. They lynched people from that tree. You ever see a hanging tree, boy? Who lives here? Look around. Nobody lives here. Who used to live here? What the hell is that? What's that in the chimney? The deed you have to this house is worthless, just like the house. Look, I just want to know if people from my family lived here. Nick! Hey. Time's up. Let's go, buddy. Let's get back to the car, OK? Sam and Chris say they have help ' How do you like your house, Nick? You seen enough? Are you not understanding something, Nick? When the flood came and wiped out this town, people blamed... this house! Did you know that? Survivors called it the Second Flood of Noah because they thought it came from God to wash away this house and all the horrors that came with it. This place was ripped from the earth and slammed into that tree. Instead of a pile of broken sticks, it's all still here. Chairs, tables, chandeliers... they shouldn't be here, Nick. I thought you said that was you. You said you'd been swinging a hammer in here for years. I have. I've been trying to tear it down. Nick, let's go! You tell you friend to run as fast and as far away as he can. Nicky? And you run with him, and never come back. Nick! There's some guys out here! You come back here, it'll be the last thing you'll ever remember doing. Let's go, let's go, let's go. They're trying to cut us off! Who the hell are these guys? What the hell are these guys? Go, go, go. Ryan? Yeah, I think... Yeah. Whoa! What the fuck happened? What? What did he say to you? He didn't say anything! What did you say to him? Get the fuck off of him. Look, I do not know what's going on, OK? Did he say something to you or not? Uughh! Aaah! Nnnnghh! Unngh! Hahhh! Aaaghh! Auurrrghhh! Aah! Ooh! There was a kick. How far along are you? Yeah, just far enough along to wonder what the hell we're doing out here. Can I? Sure. Ooh! Did you feel that? You know, they say that they can feel things in there. Joy, fear... whatever the mother's feeling. God! He's really worked up about something. Well, maybe he just doesn't like strangers? Evie! What? What are they saying? Evie! What? Evie! Get in the car! Get in the car! Get in the car! What the fuck is going on? Get in the van! Get in the van! Get in the car! Get in the van! Fuck the car! Get in the van! Get in the van! Go, go, go, go. Go! Go! Move this fucking thing! Oh, fuck! Who the fuck are they? How'd they get in front of us? Aauughhh! Get him off! Get him off! Get him off! Get him off, get him off! I'm trying! What the fuck? Where's Sam? Where is everybody? Diner looks closed. Lillith? Lillith? Hello? Anyone back there? Hello? Anybody? What are you looking at? I'll make sure Nick gets back to the house. You have my word. I'll bring your followers together to fight. Yes, Lucky. Don't worry. We'll get the 23. You will rise. We will all rise. No, I just told you. On a state highway off an old flood road. Look, we just passed Worthington, OK? It's the county seat. And where are you? Hello? God! I cannot stay connected long enough to talk to anybody. Forget it. I tried. None of the phones have been working today. Nick, what happened in there? What happened? What was said? Yeah, man. I told you, he tried to scare me, OK? He must have been hiding something. Yes, my first guess is drugs. I mean, look at the guy. Look at his gang of inbreds. They don't even fucking walk upright. Yeah, well, they know how to throw a fucking axe. He's running something illegal out of that house. Bet on it. Or he's just some hillbilly lunatic who thinks the state's gonna take his house. Oh my god! Oh, shit! Stop! I'm standing on the brake! Sorry about that. Are you OK? OK. What the fuck did you do? You drove us in a fucking circle? What are you talking about? That can't be the house. Then I hell is it? We left the house 30 miles back in the opposite direction. You drove us in a circle and you didn't know it? How? We all saw the signs. We were heading south. The house was north. Nick? Nicky? I smell gasoline. What? I smell gasoline. Oh, Jesus. OK, OK. Come on, come on. Let me get you out of here. To where? Where? Anywhere. Just away from this van. I have to sit down. Hey, wasn't that guy the guy from the diner we almost hit up there? Up where? What the hell are you talking about? I don't even see the ridge that we came from. No, look, he's got to be getting help though, right? Well, shouldn't one of us at least try to get back to the road to let them know where to find us? He kicked. But... but that's good, though, right? Nick, feel. There's nobody in the surrounding forest that I can see. And, uh, the house is empty. What? You went inside? I didn't think it could be the same house. And? Same porch. Same tree. Same lion out front. I swear, I did not drive us in a circle, but unless that house is following us, that must be what I did. I'm sorry. This is fucking great, you guys. Evie, Evie, it's gonna be OK, all right? I'm gonna fix this. How? It's gonna be cold and dark soon, and I'm really not feeling well. We need to keep her warm, Nick. We need shelter where she can rest while we get help. Nick? You sure the house is empty? If that's some kind of drug lab, then what are we doing? It's nothing like that. I told you, it's empty. Then why was Seth there with those axemen? No one lives here, Evie, OK? Trust me, no one. Is anybody else thinking what I'm thinking? Forest, ravine, car? So the car could still be sitting there? Unless those maniacs chopped it up. Well, should we try and see? Come on, we'd never make it by dark. And Evie can't make it anywhere right now. Well, I would rather go into the woods than stay inside that place. Oh, in the same woods where they murdered Sam? Sshh! Please, shut up! We don't need to broadcast ourselves. Nick, it's like you're all ganging up against me. How am I the only one that thinks this is a bad idea? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. There is no way that I'm staying in there. Stop it. Look at me, OK? Listen. We find one room. We wait until the sun comes up. That's it. That's all we do, OK? What if those men come back? Hey. Look at this. You see that window? That overlooks the entire yard. OK? Hey, come here. Come here. Come on, look at this window. We can see the side yard too, OK? We'll... we'll put one man on the back porch, one in the front, and we'll see anyone coming. Not after dark, we won't. Come on, Evie, OK? We cannot drag you through the woods tonight. We have to keep you and the baby warm and safe until... Don't make this just about me. I'm not. This is best for everybody. Is it? There's not a part of this, Nick, that's you wanting to be here? It's not a part of it? What is it, exactly? What is it that you think that's here that's going to solve any puzzles for you? Evie. Do you see those? Do I see what? Nnnnghhhh! Nicky! What's happening! Nnnnnghhhhh! What's happening, Nicky? Nicky! No! Get off me! Help! Nicky! Get back! Nnnggghhh! Nicky! Ah! Nick! Nicky! Nicky, Nicky! Nicky, wake up. Nicky, please wake up. Nick. Nicky, look at me. Nicky, wake up. Nicky? Ryan. Ryan, wake him up, wake him up. Nicky, look at me. Nicky, wake up. Baby, baby. Wake up, Nicky. Nicky, you gotta wake up. Wake up, Nicky. Baby, wake up. So the good news is he's still breathing and he's got a regular pulse. Then why isn't he waking up? I don't know. But look at his eyelids. That's REM sleep. He's dreaming. Lillith says there's some stuff that we should go back and get in the van. You watch him, OK? Hey. Since you decided not to have the baby tonight, maybe you could find some more candles. How quiet can you be? Mmm. Mm! No. Get back to the house. You'll know when to go in. Hey. It's so good to see you with your eyes open. How long was I out? 30 minutes? Where's Ryo? Uh, he and Lillith went to the van. What happened out there? You were touching the tree. That tree's a hanging tree, Evie. Just like Seth said. One of the bodies is from the Civil War. How would I see someone who's already died? How would I see anyone? I wasn't touching a person. I was touching a tree. Do you remember touching the baby? You said you never wanted to touch him 'cause you never wanted to know. What did you see? Is it something bad? Is that what gave you the seizure? All I saw was our baby. Yeah? And he wants out. Oh. Took you long enough. All right, Nicky. Alive and kicking, huh? This ain't. I can surf, but I can't make a phone call. What happened? Tell me. Tell you what? Why you smell like that. Smell like what? Like sex. What are you, some kind of a bloodhound all of a sudden? Lillith? You've got to be kidding me, Ryo! It was her, OK? It wasn't me. She was all over me. We're out here worried about getting our fucking heads chopped off by these lunatics... What are you? Pissed off or jealous? They could have snuck up on you! Don't you ever grab me! I grabbed your fucking jacket. That's the only thing I have ever asked you, in all of the years that we've been friends. What happened under that tree? I don't know. I know you saw something. What did you see? What did you see? Hey, get in here. Hurry up! There's something big in this wall. I just think that tree lets critters inside the framework. I mean... What the hell is that? We need that flashlight. OK. Ready? Aahh! Ready? Hey, you're not gonna kill it. I can't see anything. Come on, you're torturing it. Nick, stop it. This is cruel. I... what? I just want to see what it is. Well, you don't know what it is. It could be... it could be dangerous. Back up, back up, back up. What are you gonna do? Ryan! What the... the fuck? What did we do to it? We popped it like a zit. Jeez. There's nothing in there but goop. Holy, holy shit. Guys, shouldn't someone be outside watching the house? Yeah. She's right. I'll take the back. I'll take the front. Nick, I don't want to be here. I'm serious. I have a really bad feeling about this. Come on. We should stay where it's warm. We shouldn't stay here at all. Nicky. Peekaboo, I see you. I'm down here. My little Nicky. I remember when I used to call you that. Mom? What are you doing in there? We're all trapped in here. Your father, Nicky. He's trapped in here, too. The door to the cellar... you need to open it. Are you really my mother? Look at me. I can't. I'm not beautiful anymore. Why? What do you mean? I mean, tell your friend to stop swinging that goddamn bat! I think you're looking at a door that's never gonna open again. Not with those roots jamming it shut. Wanna give this a try? Yeah, no telling what's down there. I know. It's the only room I've never drawn. Never could. On three. One, two, three. What are you guys doing? The things in the walls are down there. What? I just want to see what's down here. Close it, now. Guys! Guys! Now, goddamn it! Jesus Christ, calm down! Hey! Axemen! Axemen everywhere! They're everywhere. They're all over the place. It's crazy. They're all over out there, just looking like they're asleep. They're all over the backyard, like statues. Where the fuck do we go? Where do you think? We only have the cellar. Go, go, go, go! It's the door. The door triggers them. What the fuck do we do? For starters, we stay away from that fucking door. Come on. Where the hell are we gonna go? Where the hell are we going? I guess we're going back to the car. You mean, if you hope it's still there. Do not let go of my hand. Run! They're gaining! Come on! Nicky! Evie, go! Nicky! Go now! Come on! Nicky! Hey! Over here, asshole! Hey! Right here! Hey. Oh my god! Get in, get in! Did you see Evie or Lillith? Oh, god, they had one of them right on their tail. I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't even look at me. I don't what happened to them. Oh, it's Sam. They just left him there like that. What is that? Oh, what's wrong with his hands? What in the holy fuck is that? What is that? That's not skin, Ryo. That's not skin. What's that shiny stuff? Hold on. What the hell is that, Ryo? That's not Sam. It... it's Sam's clothes. That's the same tree where Seth killed him. Then what the hell's wrong with him? Sammael. That's what Seth called him, remember? Yeah. And Sam, he kept correcting him, like... like Seth knew his real name. Or he knew what he was. We gotta find the girls. No, but... What are you doing? I'm doing a search for the word Sammael. Come on, we gotta find the girls. Sammael. S-A-M-M-A-E-L. It's a name from the Bible. It's a combination of the Hebrew word "sam," for poison, and "ael," A-E-L, for angel. It's a poison angel. "Sammael is one of the original angels of hell. He is the devil of death, Satan's assassin. Sammael can come in many forms, but traditionally a red-headed young man" Now we gotta find the girls. Come on. We gotta split up. We can find... we can cover more ground. Lillith. There's a glossary of demons. The name Lillith is on here. "Lillith is the daughter of the night. She is the queen of hell. Driven by insatiable hunger, Lillith stalks the Earth, seducing men, often raping them in their sleep and drinking their blood." -Come on. Ryo, this has got to... this has got to be bullshit. "By night she is the original unholy terror, stealing... stealing newborns and even the unborn from pregnant mothers and feasting on them." You OK back there? Mm-hm. Who has the keys? Ryan or Nick? Whew! Whew, that was a big one. Are you OK? Ah! Wow, he's, uh... he's really moving in there. Maybe he's just funny about me. Yeah. You get close, he starts doing cartwheels. No, no, no, no, I didn't... I didn't mean that in a bad way. No. You're right. I think I upset him. Oh, come on. I don't know what it is about me. I just... I think I freak kids out. Even in the womb, apparently. They can feel stress, remember? He feels everything I feel. That's all it is. He's... he's just freaking out 'cause I am. Lillith, turn around. Hey, I mean it. Give me your hand. Come on, do it. See? He's not kicking. It's not you. Easy. Ow. Ow! Stop! Lillith! What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? You all right? She's a demon called Lillith. She was sent to murder your child. You can't wait for Nick. By now he's found the house again. What are you talking about? Hey, I don't understand. Lillith, Christophe, and Sammael. Three demons of hell. Their purpose was to destroy the baby and make sure Nick found his way into the cellar of that house. Destroy the baby? Lillith's the eater of the young. The one you call Chris, he creates illusions, like roadsides you see but aren't there, or towns that look empty when they're not. Now I don't know where you should go, but if you want your child to live, you leave Nick behind and you make it far away from here. No, wait! I'm not leaving Nick behind. Why would Nick go back to the house? He wouldn't leave me. The beast is forbidden to enter the human world. Only his human son can invite him, and only during the boy's 23rd year. Why do you think he can touch someone and see their terrible deaths? Because Nick is the son of terrible deaths. And he can never be allowed to invite his father out of that cellar. You're wrong. You don't know Nick. You won't know him when he finds out who he is, or who his father his, or that he was conceived so that he could invite hell on Earth. She found her way to the car. Sun'll be up in an hour, and even Ryan will find the highway. But you... come on, you gotta stop running, Nick. 'Cause you're always gonna end up right back here. You don't have to be afraid of him. What the hell are you? Come on, Nick. That's kind of a big question. The same as Sam? We come from the same place. We had a job to do, Nick, and that was to see that you found your way to that cellar, just like your mother did on the day you were conceived. Is it really here in there? Or is that just a dream? With what your house is sitting on, you're gonna have a few lost souls in the walls. And the things with the axes, who are they? The, uh, opposition. So they're the angels, and you're... God's gargoyles, is what we call them. Created to scare away evil spirits. Seth brought them to frighten you, to keep you away. Am I an evil spirit? You're an abandoned child who for 23 years has been brutalized by the ignorant swine of this world who are afraid of anyone different. And there's a very special man trapped under that house who understands what your life has been. Talk to him. That's all he wants. That's all you want, isn't it? They can't hurt you. They would have killed you a long time ago if they could. We'll take care of them. This fight has been a long time coming, Nick. Go. Talk to your father. Do it! Aaaah! Nnngh! Aaaugghh! Hey. Hey! Hey! Aaaaghhhhhh! It's me, Evie. Don't scream. Don't make any noise, OK? You been wandering around all night? We have to go to the house. We have to find Nick. Nick's not at the house, Evie. He's there, Ryo. And he needs us. Why would Nick be at the house? Oh my god! We have to go back, Eve. Evie! Let's go back. We have to go in there. Nick's not gonna be here. They cut out their hearts. Come on, let's go! No! Hey, hey, hey! Come on! Who are we kidding, Eve? Do we even want to see Nick if he's in there? Ryan, he might be hurt. It's OK. It's just us. Nicky, it's me and Evie. Look at us, Nicky. What did they do to you? What did they do to you, Nicky? You're hurt, man. We gotta get... Don't touch me! Nicky, you are bleeding. You stay away from me. Let me breathe, OK? OK. What did they do to you? I asked if it was my father, and he... he said yes. Don't, Nicky... And I said yes. And it came in. And Seth and all of those things out there tried to stop him. They tried to stop me! Holy God. Nick. Our baby. I saw our baby. What did you see? I saw that we had 20. What did you see? Tell me. I'm trapped within until I get three more. Oh my god, Evie. Oh my god. What? Walk away. Evie, don't run. Get away from... Two to go. There she is. You're full of painkillers, honey. Don't try and move. You went into labor and had your baby. You don't remember? Well, he's in good shape. Let's go see your mama. There's Mama. How did I get here? You don't remember the man that brought you in? She's awake now. Yeah, you saw the picture? You like it? Yeah, that's part of the change. Yeah, we're doing good. A lot safer now. No, no, no, no. No, they're being guarded at all times. They're never getting out of there. They're never gonna find the house. I destroyed the will and the deed. Now above the door, make a window. Draw that window round. Good boy.
