You said you had it fixed it up. You don't mess with these guys. -I thought I did. -Rosa, what happened with the money?? Listen... I know someone who owns a bar. I got you a job there. He promised me US$ 800 in advance of your wages. But he has a brother and he didn 't tell his brother. They got into a big argument and today they only gave me US$ 300. Rosa, I want to work with you, cleaning the offices. So do hundreds of others. We talked about this before. I know, but I'm faster. Maya, we're not going to talk about this anymore. Enough is enough, you know... Please, stop. Okay, but what kind of bar is it?? Hi, pretty. Excuse me. Where are you from?? -Me?? -Yes. -Mexico. -Where in Mexico?? -Mexico City. -They say Mexico City women... ...are all sluts. -I don 't know. Where are you from?? We 're from Guatemala. You know what I heard?? Guatemalan men are all fairies. Did you say fairies?? What do you mean by fairies?? Mind the bottle! Mind the bottle! Don 't get in trouble with the guy at the entrance door. -Why?? -I told you, you can 't go in. -You can 't go in. -No?? And what do I do?? I don 't know, but you have to stay here. I 'll stay here, then. I 'll be here until night falls, Rosa?? I don 't know. -How are you doing?? -Not too good. Not too good?? May I help you?? Waiting for someone? You can 't hang in here. You speak English? Understand what I 'm saying? Yes, I speak English. I can understand everything. You can't hang in here. You gotta leave. Got it? -Yes. -Thank you. Are you okay? Are you lost? No, I 'm fine. Do you know anyone here who could help me get a job? No, but I can ask around. Hey, gentlemen. Guys! -She can 't hang in here. -I 'm making sure she 's alright. She 's alright. She was getting ready to leave. -She 's fine. -She 's doing nothing wrong. Look, you know the policies. She can 't hang in here. Are you sure you 'll be okay? Come on, man. We 're late. He 's just doing his job. He 's a good guy. -Big fucking donkey. -What the fuck he 's saying? -Long streak of piss. Let 's go. -What the fuck did he say? I gotcha. Pina... whatever fuck did he say. Your hair, I don 't know, I think it 's not... Can you turn around so I can see it? Can you turn sideways?? Turn around? Yeah, that 's not good. It has to be tighter, because it 's very dangerous, some machines. The uniform is a little too big. Can I see it tightened?? Can you hold it on your waist and pull it tighter so I can... Yeah, that 's nice. Good. That 's better. -That 's nice. -Well... thanks for this chance, Mr. Perez. I 'll work hard. I know you will. I know. It 's time we got someone young here, get rid of these old worthless rags. I get letters begging me to work here. You know how lucky you are? You realize that? You know, 'cause I do a favor for Rosa. I arrange the paper work. Decent paper work. For that, I charge a commission. And what kind of commission? Your first salary. We can split it over two months. I mean, you know... What do you say? Hold it! Hold it! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You 're not running, it 's not a marathon, okay? -lt 's not the Olympics, okay? -I 'll never finish on time. Yes, you will. Let me show you something. Hold it. Plug this there. -Are you trying to kill yourself? -No. -I 'll never finish on time. -You 'll finish. Take your time. Relax, take your time, get a little rhythm in it. Take long steps. Kind of swinging your butt... your shoulders, your hips, and you come back... and then you go back the other way. Act like you 're dancing. -This is your man. -Who? The vacuum? -This is your man, okay? -Sure. If you do it like this, you 'll cover the ground. Here, you try. Go, go. You 're doing it right. Come on! We 're dancing, okay? Easy up and back. Up and back. -Thanks. -Way to go. I 'm telling you, that 's your man. Treat him good, he treats you good. Watch it, Maya. First you have to use the screwdriver, like this. -This way is easier. -That 's the idea. -lt 's better than the finger. -First clean up these little bits. They 're stuck. Look out, sometimes the wind blows dirt in your face. There aren't any new facts. I think we should do it. The judge isn 't ready to grant it. He 's gonnawait. Even if we win on a couple of issues, it 'll be alright. -lt costs a lot. -I think it 's a good idea. Have I told you my theory about uniforms? They make us invisible. -Let 's do this other one now. -Why? We have to wait until they come back. What are you doing? -Wait asecond. -Christ, woman. What are you doing? -lf this goes wrong... -We 'll need the assignment language. If this doesn 't work, you 'll be up to your ass with terrible... I know! Who pushed the fucking buttons? You're crazy! And this is just your first day! There he goes! Son of a bitch! Where are you, you asshole?! Son of a bitch! Where are you? Excuse me. Don 't be scared. My God. Is that wax? I 'm sorry. Where are you, motherfucker? We 're gonna get you, motherfucker! Shit! Get out of the way! Fuck! Son of a bitch! -Where did he go? -The other side. Ernest, you went the wrong way. It 's this way! Which way?? Where?? What the fuck? People can get hurt here. I 'm sorry. -That 's okay. -I 'm not a thief. I promise. Don 't turn me in. I gotta get to the service elevator, okay? Service elevator, okay? It 's right there, down the hall. Quick, please. -Thank you, miss. -You 're welcome. Where are you, motherfucker? Nobody touches that motherfucker! He is mine! This is really nice of you. You 're not gonna get in trouble. Shut up. Sorry. That son of a bitch. We lost him. That's wonderful, assholes! What are you, triplets? Hey, fucking stop calling us that, would you? Fuck off, baldy! Just find him and quick! Why don 't you shut the fuck up? At least we 're doing something here. And who was that? Was that that ballfoot two inches... Just set your fat ass up! -You're the only one with a brain. -It's alright. IIItake it. Shit! We gotta find him. What do you got in there?? Books and old telephone books. Okay. Get out. Thank you. That was exciting. What is your name? Berta? Rosa? Teresa? -Well, you 're not Juan. -No, sure. -Where did you get this list? -ClA. -Anna? -No. -Where did you get it? -I stole it from their notes board. -You are Maya, right? -How do you know? Who the hell are you?? -Auntie 's home, Ma. -Yes?! -Where were you?? What kept you? -The queues were endless. I got this because the other kind was sold out. I 'll get it. -ls Rosa in? -Yeah. Hold on. Mommy? -What? -There 's somebody at the door. -Who is it? -I don 't know. I 'm Sam Shapiro, from Justice for Janitors ' campaign. I 'm Rosa, from Justice for Rosa's campaign. -Who is it? -What do you want? He has come to throw the wax all over the floor. Is this the clown you told me about? I 'm actually here with the Janitors Union. -May I come in for asecond? -Yeah, sure. Thanks. Sam, are you any good with electric fans? No. You actually don 't want me to touch that. -This is Luis. -Hi, Luis. -Please, have a seat. -Thanks. You want money, huh? More money than you ever imagined. You know what this is? -Let me see. -Wait. -This is a check stub. -Exactly. How much is it an hour? -US$ 8,50. -US$ 8,50? -What 's the date? -December 22, 1982. That 's 17 years ago. Seventeen years ago... that cleaner earned US$ 8,50, plus health... plus sick pay, plus holidays. Today, Los Angeles, 1999... you don 't have a Union deal, you get US$ 5,75... plus nothing. Over the past 20 years they 've taken billions of dollars from the poor. Billions! Okay?? We 're gonna get that back. Not millions, billions of dollars! Billions! You think I 'm nuts, think I 'm kidding? -I think you 're cute. -You and what army... is gonna get this money back, pal? Let me ask you something: does Rosa ever work late? No, she can 't. She plays golf. Does she get overtime? Are you out on a weekend pass from the nut house? Health care, dental care. Not just for her, for the whole family. Listen. Let 's just say one of your kids get sick. -Or Rosa. -Dad is sick. -What?? -Dad is sick. He needs an operation soon, or else he will get worse. Much worse. -What 's wrong?? -Diabetic. His eyes are really bad. -Look, that 's my problem. -Bullshit, come on. -Watch your mouth. -No offense. You're ill, alright? The kids are losing up. It 's all because of these fucking bastards. These bastards at Angel do not wanna pay health insurance. -How much the sugar kits cost?? 300? -He ran out of test strips too. -lf Rosa had this health care... -lf, if, if... -lf I hear this word once more... -Listen to me. -He would get treatment by now. -lt doesn 't have to be "if"! In the Union buildings downtown, every janitor has health care. Don 't take my word for it, go talk to them. Go down there and talk to them. I think that 's a great idea. Would you do that? -I don't think so. -Why not? If you get together with them, they'll tell you how they did it. Step by step. And if the company finds out, they're out, right? -You stall with a few you can trust. -I trust nobody. -You go to a safe place... -One mistake, I 'm in a black list. Do you have any ideawhat those bastards are like? -There 's a chance. -There 's every chance... you can get fired. I 've seen it before. Don 't give me any shit here. What are you going to do? Pay the rent, feed my kids? And you?? You 'd better keep away from this clown! -Listen, they'll fire us anyway. -3 months and she knows everything. -That 's not what... -Mom, take it easy. -Do something! -Keep quiet! -You know everything, you 're fucked! -I don 't know anything. I 'll get you another job, like this! You know what, you two?? Homework! Quiet! You! You know?? This is it! We don't have any time anymore. We have a lot of shit to do here, we're busy. So get out. Listening never hurt anyone. That 's all I 'm asking. We might be at the bottom of the shit hole, but we're doing our best. It 's where we're gonna stay if we let them get away with that. We? We? When was the last time that you got a cleaning job? You and your Union, your fat Union white boys, college kids. -What the hell do you know? -This campaign is different, okay? Don 't ever say "we"! I believe in nothing, nobody, nothing! Nothing but this. Do you hear me, wise guy? Now get out! -Get out. This is my house. -Thank you for your time. I have too many things to do. This is my house and nobody comes to tell me what to do in my house. Bullshit. Everybody speaking at the same time! -What 's wrong with you? -What do you mean "what 's wrong"? -You just had to listen to him. -Shut up! Just shut up, everybody! -He talks sense. -Shut up or leave the house! You forgot something. Thank you. -I 'm really sorry. -That 's alright. I 'll see you again. Give me a call, whatever... All these books! He 's been at it for years, now! Coming in early... -Why so many books? -Help him. You could learn some. You know what kills me? He copies everything. Look. He 's copying the whole book. -What 's the problem with you? -Why does he copy? -Why do you bother so much? -He 's supposed to have brains. You know what I don 't get it? Why don 't you make photocopies of the whole shit?? Come here. Come here. Not you. You, come over here. What time is it? -What time it says on the clock? -I 'm sorry, my bus was... Iate. What? I can 't hear you. -The bus. -I 'm not asking you. -I can 't hear. What 's the problem? -I 'm sorry... -Where are your glasses? -...but the bus... -Where are your glasses? -My glasses? -You can 't see, you can 't work. So? -I left them at home. Sorry. If you can 't see, you can 't work. What are you doing here? I 'm sorry, sir. My bus was late. Bullshit! Your bus was late? Everybody else was on time. What happened? -You know what? You lose your shift. -I 'm sorry, sir. And don 't came back here without your glasses. You can 't see. -I forgot about them. -What the fuck is going on? -I 'm sorry... -Fucking elderly and fucking blind. You know what? Give me some cripple people, some fucking leprous. This is a fucking business we 're running, not a camp for spastics. Jesus Christ! -Do yourself a favor. Don 't come! -Tomorrow... There 's no tomorrow. Don 't come back. Don 't come back. -I need my work. -You never finish on time anyway. -You 're fired. Get out of here. -I need my work. You can 't finish on time, anyway. Go do something else. I need to work. Christ! I need my work. She reminds me so much of my mother. What 's she gonna do? -I need my work. -I know, I know. Hello, excuse me. Is that Sam Shapiro? Yes, this is Sam. -Hello, Sam. I 'm Maya. -Hi, Maya. -Do you remember me?? -Of course. The Toluca street gang. Listen, something happened at work. So we 'd like to talk with you. This building, I don 't know if you know this... is probably one of the most important buildings in L.A. now. Alright?? That 's because Angel Cleaning Company... is one of the biggest cleaning contractors in the country... and they managed to outbid Union cleaning companies, okay? And you know how they do that? They cut your wages. They don 't pay health insurance. Do you have health insurance? No. I 'll make it very clear. I 'll draw a diagram for you. -Do you have a pen? -Yeah, I do. Okay, look. You take any building, right? This is your building. You have your owners... next you got your cleaning contractors, okay? Next you got your tenants, okay? This is where it gets very interesting... because the tenants... Who are the tenants? -The tenants are many things. -Finance houses, big banks. Some of the biggest banks in this country... operate in this building. These guys have a tremendous reputation, okay? They don 't want any problems, alright? What we have to do... is we pressure these guys... to make these guys hire Union companies. -How do you do that? -How do you force them? There 's many ways to do it. I 'll explain to you. You go to... You see? People are interested in hearing. Then we will talk, okay? -I 'll explain to you. -I 'm listening. You close off an intersection. You close off one traffic light downtown at rush hour. Do you realize the effect that has on all these people? Can you imagine how many lawyers and secretaries and accountants... business people and banks, how many people 're gonna be affected by that? You multiply that throughout the entire city. Believe me, it 's cheaper to pay you a decent wage. It's true. Are you fucking crazy? What are you talking about?? Who is gonna do it? Who 's gonna do it? We 've done this and it works. We have a group of workers... Guys, don 't listen, please, to these fucking idiots. Look at them. OK, look. That 's fine. Don 't listen. Don 't listen to me. Alright? You talk to the other cleaners. Talk to the guys who are in the Union. They are having open meetings in the garage right now. If we don't do it, who's gonna do it? That 's what they say. If we get organized... What 's wrong with talking to the other janitors? Just talk to them. Okay, listen. I 'm aworker here, like you. I 've been here only about months. My English is bad, like yours. I had nothing in Russia. But here I have my job. I can feed my kids, I can pay my rent, I can do everything. Maybe tomorrow my life will be better than today. -I don't think so. -lf you listen to him... ...we 'll have trouble, believe me. -What? What 's wrong with you? Then, shut up. Let 's go. Let 's go. Shut up you. You're not the boss. You 're a janitor like everyone else. OK, let 's go. I can 't have anything with this. This is not my business. Let's finish this meeting now, please. -We want to listen. -You never come back, please. Where are we going? Don 't be so impatient. -Tell me, where are we going? -Calm down, wait and see. Look at this. Read it. Did you pay US$ 1,600? I 've been saving for years. Guess what? I 'm going to university. -Here? -Yes! -Just like that? -I pay 20%, they pay 80%. -Who 's they? -A company. It 's something like US$ 16,000! 16,000 goddamn dollars! Think of it! -My dream, ever since I arrived. -How did you do it? Who 's paying? Look, first I took an exam. I didn 't do too well in the oral exam. But in maths I came first. They still didn 't give me a scholarship. You know why? Just because I 'm not a U.S. citizen. But after that... I found this private foundation run by two very rich Mexican brothers. They got about 800 applications. Guess who they picked? -No! -I was number one, baby. -And now?? -Now I just have to prove... I 've paid 20% of the fees before the semester begins. And then I 'll just have to pay US$ 1,600. -And you 're in? -That 's it. Congratulations! I can't believe it. Dear Ma, I moved into a new office today. But Iife isn't so good at home. It's impossible to find good servants these days... Iet alone a good cook. I also need someone to walk the dog. I m having to send my chauffeur, Hector... into the city to pick you up. He has strict orders to Iock you in the trunk if you misbehave. -Maya? -Here. Maya, come quick. Perez is mad, he 's pissed off... ...and he wants us downstairs now. -Now? Right now. We have enough problems. You think you're pretty fucking smart, don 't you? Don't you? Pretty fucking smart. You didn 't think we 'd find out about your little fucking meeting? You know what? We're fucking smarter than you. What 's this I got in my back pocket? Anybody seen this before? Look at it! Media. Where the fuck you think you are, the White House? You know what? Join the Union... and they'll take 20% off your fucking check. Join the Union, and they'll check your fucking papers. You got lmmigration. Join the Union. They'll make your fucking life difficult. Look at me. Look at me! No fucking Union, right? Right? And let me tell you this, if we catch any of you... talking to those motherfuckers, we got security... we got surveillance cameras everywhere, you can get out of here. Try it. Now get back to work. Get out of here! I don 't wanna fucking see you guys! -Do we go back to work? -Go back to work, get out of here. Back to work! You still gotta finish on time. Get out of here! That 's what I think of your fucking flyer! Get the fuck out of here. I don't wanna see you guys. Berta. One minute, please. Sit down. -How are you? -Fine. Three and a half floors. It's hard. Three and a half floors is tough. Takes it out of you. How about a vacation? Would you like that? -Yes, I 'd love that. -Take a week off. -Full pay. US$ 12,50 an hour. -That 's nice! -ls it swell? -lt's swell! -With insurance. -That too?? In the company we have new contracts. There'll be lots of work. We'll need people who we can really trust. A lot of confidence. -How'd you like to be asupervisor? -Me? I 'd like it. I would try to do my best. You 've been here many years now. -How many? -17 years. You think you could be a supervisor?? Yes, I could. That 's all I wanted to know. Thanks. Sit down again. One thing. Who organized the meeting with the Union? Who was it, Berta? Do you know? Can you tell me who it was? Come in. -What 's wrong? -What 's wrong? What is this? -What is this? -Don 't you remember? It 's three in the morning. I don 't know. You left it in the basement... and Perez found it. -The supervisor. -Oh, no! Have you any ideawhat is like to have this guy on our back? Can I ask you something? What do you risk? How much do you get paid? US$ 22,250. -What happened? Were you fired? -No. They fired Berta. Shit. They wanted to know who organized the meeting. But she wouldn 't tell them. I feel very stupid. I feel... I don't know, I fucked up. Yeah, I know, but... she has all her family in El Salvador... and she 's sent them her money, all her money for them... since 17 years ago. She was saving money for her daughter 's wedding. -She has not seen her for 5 years. -I 'm sorry. -You don't understand. -Easy, we 're gonna work it out. Do you wanna a drink? I don 't know what else to offer you now, I 'm sorry. Yes, thanks. Good, because I need one. Here. Sit down. Thanks. It 's not great, but it does work. Thanks. I 'm sorry. Don 't see Rosa for the rest of your life. She is ready to cut your balls off. That 's nice. Yes, she 's a tough one. Sometimes... I... get scared... everything is going to go wrong. Sometimes l... think... what is going to happen with me. And... I don't have an answer. I'm afraid. Please. Thanks. That 's our rights... He's watching us. If he says something, we talk about what we had for lunch. Okay, let 's go guys. Okay, let 's go. Let 's go. Hey, where the fuck you think you 're going? -We 're going for a walk. -We 're gonna get "burritos". -lt 's lunch break. -Bullshit! Get your asses in there. No, I don 't think so. Lunch time is our time, you can 't keep us in. -Who the fuck said so? -Who? Says the law. The court! If you can read this judgement... Bullshit. Do you wanna read that? Look. Read that. -We all got our copies. -Bullshit, Oscar. -I don 't give a fuck what you have. -Read it. Read it. Just read it. Read it carefully. It 's our right to organize. -Okay? -This is bullshit! -We got an attorney. -You got an attorney? We got an attorney to tell us what we can do. Let 's go. Hurry up. Let 's go! -Don 't talk like that, man. -A lot of troublemakers, man. Rosa, where are you going? -Come on, Rosa! -Take your fucking hands off me! What are you doing?? What is this shit, Freddy? What the fuck is this? I don 't know. Restrain and "corsed". -What? -"Coarsed". -Where? -What 's that word right there? -Coerced. -"Coerced"? Is that good? No, I don 't think so. Fuck! ...sent father Gregorio, from the church Pico Union. We are here tonight to send avery strong message... to all these building owners. The janitors in this city are getting ready to fight. We'll do whatever it takes to have better working conditions in here. Especially buildings like this one behind you... cleaned by a non-Union company that don 't give workers rights. Yeah, that 's it. It 's a pleasure to be with you now. I have great news for you. For the first time... we have non-union janitors from building 646. Guys, I 'd like you to come up and introduce yourselves. Come on up. We can do it! We can do it! Good evening. I'm very happy to be here this night. And I'm very glad to hear and to see that here are some students... to see other workers from other unions. All this reminds me of something that... sometimes we forget. We have always got... more strength than we realize. Always! I learned that in my country... when I organized students, peasants, workers... back there in El Salvador. But sometimes life is very hard. Sometimes you lose someone you love... your family, a friend... then you have to come to this country... and sometimes you can become sad... angry... upset, frightened... or you even lose hope. I feel the hope back... now that I 'm here with you. And I thank you for that. Justice! Now! Janitors together will never be defeated! We're trying to fight for a decent wage for these people. Mr. Griffin. Hi. You're the building manager for 646, right?? -Yeah. Do I know you?? -No, but I know who you are. -What the hell is going on?? -Let me ask you something. Can you survive on US$ 5,75 an hour?? Because that 's what the janitors at your building get. You know what?? I don 't hire the janitors and I don 't pay them. So therefore I suggest that you take this up with their employers... ...which is Angel 's Services. -This is really good wine. -You know?? You shouldn 't tell tales. -You 're the building manager, right?? -You take it up. -Who the hell do you think you are?? Coming in here, telling me I need to do... I don 't need. I need to do whatever I want to do. This is a private... Eat the broccoli, Mr. Griffin, it 's really good for your heart. -lt looks good. -Yeah, that looks great. I'll tell you what is good for my heart. It 's you can leave now! Now! My lamb chop! Tony! The guy just stole a lamb chop off of my plate. What kind of place is this? We eat here all the time. His accusations... I 'm not a thief. -What are you doing? Give me that! -Mr. Griffin invited me. We know, Mr. Griffin, we know how you walk out on bills. You 're not helping your cause there. You 're gonna hear from my lawyers. I'm tired of being harassed! Everywhere I go I 'm harassed by you. This march took place in Century City, Los Angeles, in 1990. So you 're gonnasee it what it is and we 'll talk about. Forthe janitors of Los Angeles, this was supposed to be another morning. They would sing, they would march, some would go to jail. But when the marchers reached the entrance to Century City... they found themselves trapped in a movie, a very bad movie. Twice the demonstrators tried to submit to arrest. The police moved in with vengeance. The marchers were barely able to scramble to Century and nearby it. Fifty of them would go to jail. But more than 60 demonstrators would end up in hospitals and ERs. Among them, were two pregnant women. One of whom would miscarry. I want to survive in this country Iegally. I m not robbing a bank or doing anything wrong. I m simply asking for an increase for the work that I do. And the policeman hit me on my back and my hip... and he shoved me as I was garbage. He hit me awfully. I Iike to study English because I feel obliged to do so So I can defende myself from a terrible white man I Iike to study English because I feel obliged to do so So I can defende myself from a terrible white man At the place I worked, they always bossed me around Just because I didn' t know how to speak English Just because I didn' t know how to speak English The terrible white man would tell me in English The terrible white man would tell me in English You, rustic yokel, don' t know what you're supposed to do You, rustic yokel, don' t know what you're supposed to do You, rustic yokel, don' t know what you're supposed to do Thank you! And let 's keep on playing music! This one comes from our race and goes back to it saying like this: Icame here to sing about a very sad situation About the Iaws being created by the White House and the Immigration Our Latin-American people are always being discriminated They take away all our rights and send us to the Immigration They take away all our rights and send us to the Immigration But I II never Ieave here I II be here forever I II never Ieave here I II be here forever I II never Ieave here I II be here forever I II never Ieave here I II be here forever Here I say all I m saying singing this jolly song It's better to die in the battle than Iive a Iife on bended knees The battle has to go on with the good old famous words Everybody yelling together We can do it! We can do it! -Yell! -We can do it! We can do it! We can do it! We can do it! We can do it! -We can do it!We can do it! -Come on! We can do it! We can do it! -Once more! -We can do it! We can do it! We can do it! We can do it! Thank you, thank you! Of course we will keep on playing! The next one is an ice-breaker! And this is for the North workers, here we go! Somebody call an ambulance! Hey, mom! Call an ambulance. Call an ambulance. -We need somebody! -Come on! Ma'am! Ma'am... -ls my dad okay?? -How is he?? He is okay. His diabetes is serious but he 's not critical. He 's stable now, so don 't worry. He was dehydrated, we gave him fluids. -lt 's very common with diabetics. -How serious differs from critical? He has some renal disfunction. -His kidneys?? -And I suspect he has retinopathy. -His eyes will need laser treatment. -You mean he can go blind? You need to make an appointment with the diabetics clinic. -They'll run tests and help you. -I can 't wait anymore. I 've been waiting months and months, in the end they fuck up the date. Now I 'm telling... Shit! -I can 't wait anymore. -Listen, there 's nothing I can do. I 'm sorry, you 'll just have to speak to them, okay? Wait, wait. I want to have aword with you. I 'll catch up with you. -I 'm about to have a meeting. -Come here. Three injunctions in two days? Come on, what is that? Do you wanna tell me what you were doing in Beverly Hills at night? -Well, it 's a free country. -No, not in Beverly Hills. What is this? Singing, dancing... That was a little lullaby for Mr. Wallace. -Who is he? -The CEO of Angel 's Services. What is this here about jamming his office up with 4 faxes in one day? -I tried to get in contact with him. -Jesus Christ! What are you doing? The lawyers are going insane. Don 't you understand? I tried to keep them off your back, they stuck on my ass. You want that? -Are the old timers waking up? -Don 't go there, okay? Let 's just see where you are in ten years, okay? I think we gotta start talking about changing our target. What?? We've been working in this building for 4 months. I won't change target. What do you have to show for it? Jackshit, Sam. They're waiting for me to go to a meeting, what do I tell them? -What? Go for an easier target? -No, a better target. -Please, Steve. -A better target with a better goal. That 's what you tell them. Remember who pays your wages. The old days. Collect your dues, pay your pensions, fuck the organizers. Is that what you want? You fucking dick head! You have no idea the fucking battles I've been through. Another one of these we'll be up to our ass in debt. You want that? And I can have your million to get the Democrats next election? -They can piss out of the toilet? -ln debt. You know what that means? Our hands tied behind our backs. You want that?? Subject to order? Sent back to the Stone Age because of your carelessness? No organizers? Think. To be continued... We 're gonna win! I get another one of these, I 'm shoveling it right up your ass. You 're giving me a fucking heart attack. You know the Hollywood lawyers on the 27th floor? Remember those ones? We found out that... they're not just the largest tenants in the building... but also they own 15% there. They don 't only represent these big stars, alright? These guys have invested interest in this building, right? Not only that, we found out, we got some juicy information... they are about to merge with another big law firm... that handles even more big clients, which will make them more powerful. -What 's so juicy about that? -Yes, what? They 're gonna have themselves a little party. A celebration. They 're gonna have some very powerful people there. Big managers, agents, maybe some actors... Some of the richest men in the city are gonna be there. What do you want us to do about it? I mean, you know... We 're gonna crash the party, okay? With volunteers. But we need to get in the building. Wait, wait. Listen to the man. Let him talk. What 's the point of this? The point... First of all, no one fucks with the stars, right? That 's rule number one. I 'm gonna personally embarrass the shit out of these attorneys, OK? You just gotta get me in the building. This is the biggest public event we might have in years, you understand? We can win or lose everything. For me, it's complicated. I have to tell you something about college. Everything is ready. I'll be able to pay the US$ 1,600 by the deadline. I'll have only US$ 125 left. But if I don't pay in time... the scholarship will go to the next in line. What are you trying to say? I 'm not doing it. Doing what?? The truth is, Maya... I don 't want to jeopardize the scholarship. I don 't want to lose it. I nearly killed myself the last 5 years... to get it, and then lose it, just like that. Just like that? I think our families can't afford... to lose the money we send them. But it 's different, Maya. I don 't know, the only thing I believe is that... if we don 't do this way, we won 't get anywhere. Nothing will change. I'm not doing it just for me. It 's for you, too. Don 't say that. Why not, Maya? You know I care about you. I want us to be together. I don 't know what I want. Is it Sam? I like him. He's fun to be with. I learn from him. He believes in something. And he's white. Don't give me that shit. I don't know what you think. That 's why you 're doing it, right? Remember what you said when they fired Teresa? "She reminds me of my mother". That 's why I 'm doing it. I 'm doing it because my sister has had to work 16 hours each day... since she got here because her husband... can 't pay the hospital bills, he doesn 't have medical cover... Iike million other people in this fucking country... that is the richest in the world! I'm doing it because I had to pay Perez... two months of my wages and beg him for a job. I'm doing it because we have to feed those bastards... we wipe their asses, we get everything ready for them. We raise their children and they look right through us. Maybe I'll go to school too, some day. But what 's the point if you forget more than you learn? How are you? Thanks so much for coming. -I 'm a friend of Gavin 's. -Gavin? Sure. Oscar, you have to secure the fire exit, okay? Keep them unlocked. Ella, you hold the elevator. So when the guys... you bring the guys in, okay? So you meet Ella, bring the guys in and that 's it. And you will be up there. We're gonnawait for the guys upstairs. Alright. Listen. This is it, I got the radio. It 's working pretty good. So I'll listen the security guards. If anything happens, I'll let you know beforehand, alright? I'm a big fan of him. An excellent guy. Good actor. Ladies and gentlemen, if we can have your attention for just a moment? We'd like to thank you all for coming today. This is a big day for Ted and l, bringing together separate firms. A merger is always a difficult process but we've worked it through. Indeed we have. It 's a personal triumph that after weeks... of intense negotiations, we finally decided on whose name goes first. My congratulations to both of you. My friend'd like to say a few words. Will you mind?? I mean, this is avery special occasion. He 's a friend of Gavin 's. It 's fine. Sure. Just a few words. -Please, introduce yourself. -Hello, everybody. My name's Sam. I just wanna say that... with unsurpassed brilliance you 've represented some of the best actors. But as you 're negotiating these multimillion dollars contracts... the janitors in your building earn less than US$ 12,000 a year. Allow me to present you... your "golden turkey", for the worst performance by an attorney. There you go. Great. Wonderful. We just want to make a point that janitors in this building... owned by this firm, they make poverty wages. -And that 's no fair. -These guys make US$ 5,00 an hour. -I really appreciate your coming... -Anyway, I 'd like to clarify... -Thanks for sharing your thoughts... -I want to say... I have a demonstration that might help ensure you get the message. Free of charge. Pro bono, if you will. We can demonstrate what a superior job the Union cleaners can do. So... enjoy the show. Ernest, get the fuck up here right away. ...Iawyers and business executives who work in this high-rise... come and go without much thought for those who sweep the floor. Tonight, they were impossible to ignore. Justice! Now! They demanded justice for janitors outside the downtown high-rise... that was sold 15 months ago. We pay 75% of our wages in rent. And then we have to buy food... and have to buy clothes for our children. The spokesman, Tony Rizzoli, says the company's taking a hard Iine. They felt necessary to sneak into the building, disrupt everything... turning on vacuum cleaners, yelling and screaming. But it's a tough Iife for unskilled Iaborers... when there's no shortage of workers willing to do their job for Iess. Angel has been out there for years, there's never been a complaint... about the Iiving wage, about the working conditions. And, excuse me, it's been going on for 3 weeks, I m sick of this. No talking's been scheduled and the Union says the marchers'II be back. Management says if there's another trespassing, they'II be arrested. What?? Wait a second. Oh, Jesus! Hold on. I can 't do this here. Hold on. I 'm going to get in so much trouble if I get caught. You 're a troublemaker. Sometimes. Oh, shit! Do you want me to get in trouble when we 're all set? All right, everybody, line up. Let 's go! Let 's go, let 's go! Line up! Stand up! Shit... -What 's happening? -All right, goddamn it! You, Ben... You, Ruben... Dolores... You, Juan... Oscar... And, definetely your ass, Ella. Got 2 minutes to get your shit and get the fuck out of here. Before I have you thrown out. What are you talking about? We haven't done anything. -You haven 't done anything? -No. You let unauthorized people into my building. Which is a violation of company policy. For which you can be terminated, which is what this is motherfuckers. It was you, fucking bitch! It was you, Marina! Easy, easy. -I'm pregnant, you fucking bitch! -You 're fucking crazy! -I 'm not crazy! -You are! I didn 't say anything. Take it easy. They weren't involved. I did it. -Shut up! -I 'm telling you that I did it... Ruben wasn 't involved. He 's nothing to do. He'll lose his scholarship. I don 't give ashit. You did it. You can go too. I can go, but not them. -You and all of them can get out! -What are you talking about? -I don 't give a shit! -What have you done, Marina?? Why? It wasn't me. And keep your mouth shut, please, Maya. -Alright, that 's enough! -No! Where is your sister, Rosa? -Where is your sister? -I don 't know where is my sister. She 's taking care of her husband. What are you talking about? I 'd like to know why you do that. She 's warned him. I say the truth. -What are you talking about? -Why would she do such thing? She phoned him, she said she was sick. And after that, she told him who was involved. -Goddamn it! Shut up! -What are you talking about? -You're a fucking liar! -Goddamn it! Shut up! Ask him who 's gonna be the new supervisor of the new buildings. What? Marina... It 's gonna be your sister Rosa. -Please, guys, believe me. -We don 't believe. Ask him. It 's not the first time that she says something like that. -What happened to my sister? -lt 's none of your business. Yes, it 's our business because we 're losing our jobs. It 's my sister. I did it, I 'm telling you, I wanna know the truth. Ask her, ask your sister. -Get them out! Get them out of here! -Fuck you! Fuck you! You can't do this to people. Why? Ella, your friend... Dolores... Ben... Ruben will lose his place at university. He wasn't even there! -Shut your trap! -No, I don 't. Dolores is pregnant. Shut up. They 'd have lost their jobs anyway, sooner or later. So it was really you?? Yes, and I would do it again. I 'm not watching my husband die... while he waits to get on awaiting list. Life is now, Maya. Now, stupid! This is no fucking fairy tale! -Why? -"Why" what? Why did you sell us out? Why did you sell us out? You sold yourselves out. Especially you. On your own. We always think we 're going to win, right? When are we going to face facts? When will we realize they are too strong for us? They've always been. How many times have we tried, dear God? Pick up the clothes. You 're a fucking traitor, Rosa! A fucking traitor, sister. Oh, yes? You think I 'm a traitor? Really? Is that what you think? While I was feeding you all? Sending money to mother and you? You think so? Filling your bellies?! Did you ever wondered how Rosa raised the money? How old was I when I arrived in Tijuana? I was a kid. A kid, wasn 't l? And nobody wondered. Why bother?? Rosa kept your bellies nice and full. You know how I did it? Whoring! I was a prostitute! How about that? -I had no idea. -I was awhore, sister. To keep you all from starving! For 5 fucking years in Tijuana, every single night... ...just about every single night. -I had no idea. Suck their cocks, Rosa! Do it! Fuck, Rosa, fuck! Do it. Your family is starving to death. Suck their dicks! Come on! Fuck, fuck! Sounds ugly, right?? Disgusting?? What do you think now?? Nobody wondered, right?? Dad walks out. Who gets screwed?? I didn 't know, Rosa. I didn 't know! Rosa goes out to fuck! Let Rosa fuck... and suck every cock on earth! Black, white... filthy, greasy, whatever! She can fuck the whole world, right? -We didn 't know. -My husband gets sick, I fuck! Who gets screwed?? Rosa! Let Rosa do the dirty work! Let Rosa do it all! Fool that she is! Let Rosa fuck the planet so you can all stuff your bellies. I hate the whole fucking world! I 've put up with it all my fucking life! It 's been always inside me, here in my guts! How do you like that, Maya? Come here. -I 'm talking to you. -Rosa, I didn 't know. You know how I got you that job? You wanted a job, didn 't you? "Please, sister, get me a job, I can do anything." You know what I did? That 's right, sister. I fucked Perez. I fucked him! For you! I fucked him for you! Because I 'm tired! Tired! All my life. My husband gets sick? I fuck. Dad walks out? I fuck. -I din 't know. -You want a job? I fuck. For Christ, Rosa, I didn 't know! No?? You shut your eyes? You feel bad now? You feel bad now? I have a husband, I have two kids and what? And I 'm a fucking whore, right? That 's what I am, because I did it in Tijuana and keep on doing here. How do you like that, Maya? My own daughter asks me where her daddy is. What am I going to tell her, Maya? I don 't even remember his face. "l don 't know who the hell he is. You were born in a brothel, daughter." You are right, Maya. I 'm a fucking traitor. A traitor to myself, to my family and my daughter! Rosa, what have we done to you? What have you done to me?? I had no idea. Sir, can I use the restroom? To your left, on the back. Don 't lose it. Sir, there 's a body! Oh, my God! Where 's the body? What body? Shit. Open the fucking door! Listen, lady... you better open the fucking door, or I 'll tell you right now... ...you 'll get in trouble. Open it! -There 's a pervert... in the lady 's restoroom, he 's got his pants pulled down. -He 's got his pants down? -Yes, it 's horrible. -Calm down. You call the police. -Thank you. -I 'll take care of him. -Thank you so much. -Hey, buddy. -What?? -Why don 't you pull up your pants? -Pull up my pants? What are you doing with your pants down, showing up to women? -What the fuck?? Open this door! -The police are on their way. What is this? Look and see... Is this a joke or what? You start on September 12th. Where did you get so much money? Don 't ask. Listen. If you don 't become this country 's top lawyer... I 'll never forgive you. I don 't know what to say, Maya. -Go to college. -Thank you. -What do we want? -Justice! -And when? -Now! -What do we want? -Justice! We can do it! We can do it! Justice! Now! Justice! Now! We can do it! We can do it! We can do it! We can do it! -Do you wanna have dinner tonight? -Tonight? Yeah. -Tonight? -At my house. -What are we having?? Pizza? -No, I 'll cook. I 'll pick you at 8. We can do it! We can do it! We can do it! We can do it! We want bread... but roses too! Upwith the Union! Down with exploitation! Alright. Alright. Listen up. Today... is a great day for the janitors in this building, alright? We have to let the owners of this building know that we'll continue... until people get their jobs back, right? In the past few months... I 've seen you insulted... I 've seen you fired from your work... I 've seen you go through financial crises with your families... there 's been threats of deportation, friends split up because of betrail. I salute your courage. Because it takes a lot of it. Now, we're fighting for health care, right? For respect at work. We want bread, but we want roses too. We want all the beautiful things in life. You see that banner? That banner dates back to 1912... from Lawrence, Massachusetts, when 10,000 immigrant workers... mostly women, had to fight against poverty wages. It was aviolent and long dispute. But you know what happened? They won. No one is giving you roses for nothing. No one. You know when you get roses? When you stop begging... and you organize. And you form a labor movement that 's strong enough to compete against... these powerful companies that are controling our lives. Stand up for your fucking rights! We shall not be moved! We're well organized! We shall not be moved! Because we have our rights! We shall not be moved! Because we're Latin-Americans We shall not be moved! Because we're Latin-Americans We shall not be moved Because we have our rights We shall not be moved -Not even by the police! -We shall no be moved! Please, may I have your attention, please! May I have your attention, please? You have 30 seconds to disperse. Not even the police will break us apart! Listen to me. You're trespassing. You're violating the Iaw. You will have to disperse. You have 30 seconds to Ieave the building. Does she have any medical problems? -Search her and take off the cuffs. -Excuse me, spread your legs open. -Don 't push, don 't push. -Come on, sit down. Who is Jose Ramirez? Jose? What 's your name, sir? -Me? -Yeah, you. Emiliano Zapata. Augusto Sandino. -What 's your name? -Pancho Villa Junior. Give me your right thumb. Like this, okay? Come over to your right. I want you to look straight to the ceiling. -Did you fill out a no-money slip? -Yeah, I put it in with the book. -These are the last two. -The last two? Come on. All right! What 's up, man? Who sings better? You, come here. Come take a picture. Hold on. Hold on. Hey, listen up! Listen up! Listen up! -Angel wants to settle. -What? Angel wants to settle. Hold on. Everybody has been reinstated. You all got your jobs back. They're gonna give you health insurance, holidays... We've won! We have won! It 's over! How is this? How is this? I don't know. The detectives want to see you. Listen, the detectives need to talk to you. Your prints match those of a robbery suspect. What 's up?? What 's up? Where are you taking her? I don 't know. Wait! Wait! Excuse me, officer. What 's happening? What happened? It doesn 't look good. They made her prints at the scene of a robbery... ...a gas station. -That can 't be true. Do you have any relatives living in the United States, ma'am? My sister. -What 's her status? -I 'm sorry? What 's her status? Is she legal? Has any documents?? Mother's maiden name, ma'am? Hernandez. You must sign this form. Right here. You 're gonna be taken to the Tijuana border. If you re-enter the United States... you'll be prosecuted for grand theft under section 47 of the Penal Code. If convicted, you'll be subject to a prison sentence of 3 years. Do you understand? You know, this is the United States government. We're going very easy on you. Consider yourself lucky. Let her be. Here they come. -Where 's Maya? -I can't see her. -lsn't she there? -lsn't Maya there? -There she is. -We're with you, Maya! Yes, we're with you! Don 't worry, sister. -Here we are! -We're with you, Maya. We're gonna help you. Don't cry. Don't cry, Maya. Take care. Take good care of yourself. I love you.
