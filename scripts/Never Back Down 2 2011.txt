We've got some great matches for you tonight, people, make some noise! We've got boxers, wrestlers, psychos, criminals... We've got a couple of douchebags in there as well. Support these douchebags people. Make some noise out there! Isn't this fucking great? Yeah, you see that? That's you in an hour. Oh, really? Why wait? Save it. Fm ready to go out tonight, guys. I need some blood! Who wants some blood out there, guys? What the hell are we even doing here? -Any of you guys Stokes? -Yeah, I'm Stokes. You're up, bro. Get some. This one's gonna be a barnburner people. Let's hear it. This ends here. Tonight. Ends? This is where it begins. Wow. PS3, huh? What's your favourite game? I don't know. Killzone 3, I guess. -Here, let me get this. -I got it. I can give you guys a hand if you guys need any help. I'm Kurt, Mike's roommate. Hey, Kurt. John Stokes, Mike's dad. -Nice to meet you, John. -You, too. All right, so who's hungry? How about I treat you boys to lunch? I think I'm just gonna go unpack. Okay. I'll see you upstairs. -Look, Son... -Thanks for the ride. Shoulders up, Zack. All right, Zack. Smoke and Thunder, baby. Smoke and Thunder. You keep droppin' that shoulder, and any club fighter could pick you apart. Yeah? Tell that to my last three victims. -Listen, kid... -Hey, look, look, look. There's been a little change of plans, all right? I just got off the phone and Jefferson pulled out. But not to worry, all right? I got you a sub. This guy named Ortega. And he just moved up from Welterweight. He's got a 4-and-3 record. I think it's a mistake. The fight's in three weeks and we don't know anything about Ortega. The guy's 4-and-3, I'm 5-and-0. You know what that adds up to, huh? An ass whupping for Ortega. Even you can do basic math. Man, educate this dude. Title fighter right here. You tell 'em Zack, you tell 'em. It's time. Tim! Hey. Tim! Hey, Mom. What's wrong? Nothin'. Would you all leave your brother alone? Go upstairs, wash up for dinner. Come on, both of you. So, what have you got goin' for tonight? Term paper. Okay. The bank gave us a third notice and they're giving us another month to pay. You've been killing yourself ever since Dad died to keep this house, Mom. Just let me drop out. I'll get a night job. No! Go finish your term paper. And I'll bring you something for supper, okay? Go on. You know me. I'll figure something out. Go on. Dude, there's no way you can compare Wonder Woman's Iasso to Thor's hammer. That doesn't make any sense. That's like comparing a penis to a vagina. Oh, hey, I gottajump. -Hey, what's up? -Hey. Just thought I could do a little trading. Sure. What you got here? -These are '86. -Nice. Real nice. Some trippy stuff. This is yours? Yep. I got 18 more just like it at home. That's cool. You know what, the guy who's in charge of buying is this guy, Butler. He's just not in today. But... I don't know what you want to do. -Come back tomorrow? -Yeah, of course. That's cool. Actually, why don't you hang onto these, and then I'll just swing by tomorrow. Yeah, sure. For you, yeah, I'll do it. -All right. Thanks. -All right, no problem. Hey, you don't wanna, like, go out sometime? Not gonna happen, dork. Hey, Kurt, check this out. Somebody hacked the college server. It's all over the place. Come on. Come out with me. No, I'm staying in, man. Dude. -What? -We are college freshmen, man. Whether you know it or not, your body is a reservoir of raging hormones and pent-up sexual energy. What is wrong? Talk to me, all right? And then let's get on it. Okay, but you cannot tell a soul. It's about my dad. Welcome to college, man. Not bad for early season. Come. Freshman crop of honeys ripe for the taking, right? You gotta put your bid in early. Not a problem. You wait till you see my man here in action. Legend. Pick any honey in this room, Mike gets it done. -Ignore him. -Hey, hey, how's it goin'? Legend, huh? All right. That one. Right there. All right, roommate, show him how a pro gets it done. Seriously, dude, that thing with your old man, -take it out on that. -Fuck off, Kurt! Hey. Hey. -Pretty cool party. -Yeah. "Cool." Okay. All right, not the most original of openers. Let me try this again. Would you like to go grab a cup of coffee? So? Would you? If I tell you I already have a boyfriend, you promise not to take it as some big, macho challenge and try to steal me away from him? I promise? I'm already dating someone. Get a doctor! All right. Back and forth. Left and right. Step left, kick right. Left, right. Left, right. There he is! Get his ass! Let's go! I told you I was gonna get you, boy! -What? You got something to say now? -Fuck you! I think he's gonna start enjoying this ass beating, bro! Stop! -Pick his ass up! -Please! What? What? You think this is a game! I'm gonna teach you not to run your mouth. That's what I'm talking about, boy. What? You got something to say? Get him! Get him! Motherfucker! Fuck! I got something for your ass now, boy. Hold him! -Man, this is gonna hurt. -No, no, no, no, no, please, come on! -Get that motherfucker! -Come on! Let's go! Where you going? Hold it! Who this motherfucker is? What y'all want? We can take him. Hold up. We're cool. We're good bro. We'll get you another day. Let's go. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Who is it? Mike. I was told to come see the RA for some reason. Nlike, the wrestler kid? Yeah. Enter, Mike the wrestler. So, why'd you want to see me? We'll get to that, Mike the wrestler kid. But first, may I ask you, are you a fan of the fight cage? Do you have a taste for the savage science? Yeah. I guess so. Okay, great. Come on. Behold. So, you're behind this? You tell anyone that, and I'll fucking kill you. What's up with the clock? That's the countdown to the Beatdown, baby. -The what? -The Beatdown, bro. It's back. Less than 100 days to go for a second dose of ass-kicking, skull-crushing mixed martial arts madness. Cajun style. Only this time, I'm in charge. Max Cooperman, impresario of the Beatdown. Fight's on when the clock ticks down, bro. $20 a head, at a site to be determined. -A tournament? -Yeah, bro. One night, two hours, 16 fighters. Winner takes home a cool 10 grand and nationwide celebrity. Well, that sounds cool, man. But what's that got to do with me? As you can see, I have some spots to fill. And you can help by talking to some of your no-neck wrestling buddies. I'll give you a finder's fee and comps to the Beatdown. -Just keep my name out of it. -'Cause it's illegal, right? I don't know, man. You think? It's like a rave. Only instead of drugs, we're gettin' stoked on mayhem. Cops and non-believers to be avoided at all costs. I'll think about it. The swelling's gone. But if your retina detaches any more, you could go completely blind in that eye. Now your injury is caused by receiving too many blows to the head. The symptoms won't heal without a medical procedure. Well, I mean, then all I need is surgery, right? -Then I can fight again? -I'm afraid not. Well, I mean, I won't tell anyone. -You can't tell anyone either, right? -Zack, I'm sure this is atough blow, but it's not as tough as the one that takes your eyesight. Your career as a boxer is over. Oh, my gosh, girl, these guys are so hot. I know. Yeah, girl. MMA is what boxing wishes it could be. I know, right? Ground and Pound, baby. These guys could have me any day of the week. I know. I know, right? What are you guys watching? Where's lVlom at? Look, I had to do it, okay, sweetie? We need this money. -But, Mom, I just... -We can talk about this later. -I don't... -No. Go home, Tim. Hey, Stokes. Should I be worried, man? -What? -it's gotta hurt, huh? Your dad leaves your mom for another dude? You think that shit's hereditary? That's it! You're done for the day! You're done, Stokes! Don't set foot in my gymnasium again! What? I was looking into entering this Beatdown thing. Did you fucking tell him? What makes you think I have anything to do with that shit? You did. Just now. Fuck! Okay, come in. Come on, come on. Well, you obviously don't go here. How'd you find me? Comments, man, on the Orlando videos. You're semi-famous. And you ain't that hard to find. So you two wanna fight? Either one of you ever mix it up, MMA style? I box. Or used to. AAU, All City. Wrestling champ. State. Dudes, chill. Okay, I can't just put any Tom's hairy dick in the cage. I've got customers to please, aficionados of the savage science. My fighters gotta have moves. Don't worry. I got moves. -So do I. -Yeah? Show me. Let's get some! Nice. The TV. The TV. All right. All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, get off! Chill! Chill! I like the passion. You both have heart. Reminds me of a boy I brought up back in the day. But, dudes, this is mixed martial arts. It's about boxing, wrestling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, judo, Muay Thai. You gotta be hip to all the disciplines, not just one or two of 'em. You wanna be the best, you gotta take out the best. And in order to do that, you gotta learn from one of the masters. Who? Point us in the right direction. Well, lots of clubs around here are run by posers and wannabes. You boys need someone who's been in the soup. The cage. A true warrior with the scars to prove it. A name, Max. Give us a name. Case Walker. Former collegiate wrestler. Kyokushin black belt, trained jiu-jitsu in Brazil with the Machado family. One of the most fully loaded fighters on the planet. And I guarantee you, a day with this guy is like a month anywhere else. That's if he decides to take you on. Well, how come I've never heard of him? Yeah, me either. You guys ever hear of Fedor? Anderson Silva? Or Overeem before they steamrolled everyone in their path? Believe me, those guys have heard of Case. Where do we find this guy? -What? -Are you Case? You wouldn't even ask me that shit if you didn't already know. Why don't you answer my question? What? As in, motherfucker, what do you want? Look, I'm Nlike, and he's Zack. -We wanna train with you, Mr Walker. -Why? -'Cause we heard you're the best. -No, no, no, no, no. Why would I teach you? Do I know you? You kin to me? I owe you a favour? We wanna fight in the Beatdown. -Max said that you're the best... -Max? You tell that little wannabe Dana White, next time he sends a couple of bitches over to train with me, he gonna have some damn problems. Now, get the fuck outta here. Hey. I ain't no bitch, man. You ain't too smart either. What about you? Man, I don't even like this guy. But I ain't gonna let him go out like that. You all got heart. You got money? How much? This week, $20 each, five-pound bag of potatoes, and you gotta wash Daisy. Daisy? My house. I'll try you out for the day. But real talk. Our deal is I teach you. You pay me in blood, sweat and money. And I don't teach you what you want. I teach you what you need. And I never teach any two people the same way. Now what you take from here becomes yours to do with as you wish. Now, come as often as you want, or don't come at all. I won't expect a card at Christmas either way. Let me see. So I got a boxer and a wrestler. All right, Mr Boxer. You're gonna start by giving me Sprawl? Man, I don't know... My bad. I forgot to mention, shut the fuck up. I don't even wanna hear your voice. And I don't make mistakes. You do what I say, or get the fuck out. You feel me? All right, Tim, give Mr Boxer 100 sprawls, followed by 100 front kicks. Au right? Go. All right, IVlrWrestler, I got somethin' special for you. I want you to punch this piece of paper. Now, your punch has to be perfectly straight and accurate. Use the first two knuckles. Watch. Make a hole in the centre of the paper. You don't get it done, you don't move on to the next technique. Go. Hey! Don't you have a home? You ain't ready for that technique. Come back tomorrow. And you owe me a new composition notebook. Black. No, no, no, stop, stop, stop. No. Try it again. All right, good. Nice hat, dude. Fuck! Man, where's this dude at? Hey, if it's too long of a wait, why don't you stop your bitchin' and leave, hotshot? So, dude, what's your deal? How'd you end up training with Case? How come you're not in the Beatdown? I don't have to fight like some caged animal to prove I'm a man. What you tryin' to say? I didn't try, I believe I said it. Yo. Hey, chill, man. I'd like to give you a personal facelift, too. We got reason to be here, fellas. Unlike some people I know. Is that supposed to be directed at me? Yeah. What are you gonna do about it, Kurt Cobain? I'm just sick of you ridin' me, all right? That's not what your mother said. Hey! Justin! You gonna let him talk about your mama like that? Punch his ass in the face. Or better yet, do Flounder Three on his ass, like we worked on. That's got to be the worst role model since Sweep the Leg, man. Yeah, and what's Flounder Three? I don't know. This dweeb ain't gonna do shit. Got dropped on your ass, dude. You all right? -Are you crying? -What's up, bros? You guys are like a tight-knit unit now, this is great. Man, fuck that, that was a cheap shot. No, Zack, come on, man, that was even called out. I think it was called the Flounder Three, man. No hard feelings, all right? Smoke and Thunder, baby. Deal with that shit. -Come on, man, chill out. -Hey, I barely even touched him. Dude. It's cool, right, buddy? Right on, guys. Anybody seen Case? -Yo, Case. -I'll be out in a minute. -Hey. -Man, don't you knock? -I did. -Did I say come in? Hey, put that down. -Well... -Don't! Okay. Nlax, what do you want? You got a nice little band of acolytes out there, dude. Warms the heart to see. I think they might just kill each other. Dude, I know it sucks what happened. But you had the frickin' fight world by the short hairs, man. -You could still. -Nlax, what do you want? I'm just trying to help you. Let me help you, man. I can put you back in touch with some good people I know at Strikeforce. And all you gotta do is, you know... All right, dude. I can take a hint. Okay? I just hate to see a waste of God-given talent. Which brings me to the true reason for my little visit. You need cash, Sensei? I can put money in your pocket. -What is this? -Max's idea. Little pro-am action. Get the crowd excited for the upcoming Beatdown. Ifyou can survive one minute with Case, you'll get 100 bucks. That's my sensei. That's my sensei. -Is it true that your mom works here? -Not tonight she doesn't. Dude, I wish my mom worked at a strip club. Oh, shit, my girl's here. -Hi, babe. -Hey, what's up? -How are you? -You look good. Thanks. -Hey. -Mike. -Right, Mike. -Yeah, you two would know each other. Got me a little college girl. Well, at least I know it wasn't a brush-off. Yeah! Nice. That's right. Nice. -Hi, Zack. -Hey, what's up? Is that your mom? -How's your mom? -What? I mean, it must suck that your dad left your mom for another man. -What? -Hey, dude, that blows. No pun intended. No. Let's go, Case! Rip him up! Dude, get down. -Nlike, are you out of your mind? -Not a good idea. -Yo, someone get Max. -Yeah! Get some! It's stupid to fight angry. You gotta remember, an angry mind is a narrow mind. Come on. Oh, shin -Tap. -Go fuck yourself. Tap. Tap, or I'll break it. -Four, three, two, one. -Four, three, two, one. Asshole. If this was a real match, I would've broke your goddamn arm. -Fuckin' great show! -Nlike, yeah! Fuck, yeah! Who's behind all this? A fuckin' genius, man. -Looks like we got an ex-con lurking. -How can you tell? Where else do you see pull-ups like that? Where'd you do time, boy? State? Angola? Hey. I asked you a question. Well, I'm gonna have to ask you to vacate. Why? I'm not hurtin' anybody. Yeah, well, it's my job to get your black ass out of here before you do. -Come on, man. -Come on, Come on, come on, man. You listen to me, convict. I got 50 ways to make your black ass disappear. So when I say go, you better say, "How far?" -You got that? -Nlorning, Sensei. -So what the hell's goin' on here? -Nothin'. I don't wanna see you around here again. That goes for you, too. What was that all about? -What's up? -What's up, bitches? -Wow. -Dude, you're bald. Guys, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonnajoin the Beatdown, dude. If it ain't in ink, you ain't a believer. Dude, you spelled "beat" wrong. Let's cut the bullshit, guys, let's train. What's the matter with Case? Man, the cops hassled him. Said none of us can train here any more. Well, fuck the cops, right? I mean, they can't make us leave. No, no, no, no. Case is on probation. If he so much as jaywalks, they're gonna send him back to prison. Yeah, well what does Mike give a shit about Case? Obviously, he don't. What are you talking about? That's not true. Really? Is that why you put him in a position to suffer his only loss? Yeah, that's right, asshole. Because he spared breaking your arm, he's now been defeated. Nah. That was just a bullshit match at the strip club, man. No, not to him. To him it was an I mean, what has he got? Daisy? What the hell did you guys do? You guys cheered? Really? He should have ripped your arm off and he should have shoved it right up your ass. What? Hey, Case, it's Mike. Can I please talk to you? You heard the cops, we've been shut down. Just leave me alone. All of you. We gotta find him a place to train, man. Yeah, not some shitty vacant lot, either. We need a proper dojo, man. Oh, shit, guys. I think I know a place. For years, we've been delivering people new furniture and hauling the old stuff away for free. Originally, we were gonna fix it up, try to resell it. As you can see, that never happened. I talked to Ted and he said if we clean the place out, we could make it our own dojo. Just have to pay the utilities, no rent. What do you guys think? I think we got a lot of work to do. -it's fucking perfect. -What? While you guys finish cleaning up, I'm gonna go make sure Case doesn't leave town. I got an idea, fellas. How to get some equipment at a real bargain. -Hey, babe. -Oh, hey, not now. I'll be back in a couple of hours, all right? Look, I'm sorry, all right? It was just something I heard. I don't know what you're talking about. People gossip. it's what they do. I didn't know it was some big secret. Okay, can we talk about something other than my father's sexual orientation? Well, it's not like you're gay, right? I mean, like, homosexuality isn't, like, hereditary. It's not like a disease. And no, I'm not gay. How do you know? How many girls have you slept with? I don't know. Who the hell keeps count? Seventeen. What? -Seventeen? -Yeah. Seventeen. Heavy numbers, don't you think? Relative to what? A player like you? Look, I've done okay. Define "okay". And if you lie, you curse yourself to a life of bad lovers. You were saying? Okay, I got an idea. I'm gonna write my guess on this table. But do not look until I walk away. And no peeking. All right, put it down, fellas. Yeah! I got all the equipment, fellas! Look what Daddy's got. What do you think? Put it down, fellas. Where'd all this shit come from? Let's just say it was liberated from a certain boxing gym. I thought the idea was to keep Case out of jail. Believe me, Frankie is never gonna report this stuff stolen. Yeah? How can you be so sure? 'Cause I know the gym he stole it from. World of boxing, right? Well, this ain't even half of it. I got a truckload more stuff outside. Let's hustle, fellas. I'll be damned. Not too bad, huh? Well? That's my inspiration. Little piece of equipment I used to use back in the day. I'll demonstrate. Just... You might want to back up a little bit. In case I still got it, you know? This far enough? Yeah, like a foot further. Fucker. Thank you. Thank you. Is he really gonna do that? Now would you rather push your opponent or finish your opponent? Don't worry about the bag. A little duct tape will fix that up. Let's get started. -That was powerful. -Okay. Rubber Guard basics. First go to Mission Control. Right here. Then we Zombie the arm. Next, we go to Chill Dog. Up and over. Once in Chill Dog, I can choose whatever submission I want. This one is called Gogoplata. All right. And time. Switch. Come on, come on, come on. That's good. That's good. You've got a good chance to win this thing. Nah, man. I'm just not interested any more. Oh, shit. Dude, is that Lyoto Machida? Yeah. It is. He used to be light heavyweight champion, dude. What's he doing here? Him and Case used to train together in Brazil. Okay, so, dude, what's the deal with Case? I mean, why isn't he world frickin' champ? Well, he was champ in a few other organisations. Max told me six years ago, he was set to take the MMA world by storm. Then he just disappeared. Damn. That must have been when he went to prison, right? Nope. He was only in prison for two years. He got out on good behaviour. Hey. What are you guys lookin' at? Go get ready. Hey, so what was Case convicted of? Never asked, he never told. Bet it rhymes with "kromicide". I saw some old clips of him on YouTube fighting. You would not believe the famous dudes he's beaten. I know. Case got busted for cuttin' the tag off a pillow. Did you see his fights with Ray Sefo? Or how about him versus Bas Rutten? Zerohacker Lebanon GOODFELLAS DVDS -Yeah. -Those were some good fights, man. Or what about, what's his name, the blonde, buff brother? Melvin Guillard. No, no, no. He's, like, half Case's size. Sisqo. -Michael MacDonald? -No, no, no. Bigger than him. I know. Case got in trouble for copying a Hornets game without the written consent of the NBA. Dude, did you forget to take your meds or something today? No, this guy, he suplexed Fedor. And he knocked out Mirko Cro Cop. Kevin Randleman. Hey, guys, I just... I just wanted to say, look, what you guys did for me with this gym, I just wanted to say thanks. Go easier on us in sparring might be one way to show your gratitude. You know, it's your temper that gets you into trouble sparring. I'm a little worried about you. Zack needs to be the one worried about Mike. What, you don't see the way he looks at Eve? I'm just sayin', dude, you need to get your own girl. I'm just gonna ignore this clown. Hey, Nlike, why don't you slip me your mom's number? I hear she's single. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. You guys wanna go at it? Get in the cage. Yeah, I wanna go at it. Let's get in the fuckin' cage. All right, good fight, guys. Good fight. Here. Right here. Oh, almost. You know what, I'm gonna fight like your daddy. Nice. Watch the wrist, man. He's got you, bro. Just tap. -He ain't tappin'. -Dude, don't be a dummy, man. Tap. He ain't gonna tap. Are you okay? -Zack told me you got hurt. -Yeah, I'm fine. I heard you were caught in like some triangle thing. Yeah, tell me about it. -What? -Nothing. -Do you wanna come in? -No. I was just... I was just here to check on you. -But you seem fine. -Yeah, I feel okay. I guess I could be better. I mean, maybe I should've tapped. Well, when you have the opportunity to tap, maybe you should. You know, I can come back later. -In fact, I left something in the field house... -No. I was just leaving. So, bye. I am so sorry, bro. No, it's okay, man. Anyway, she's got a boyfriend. Yo, man, maybe it's the headgear, man. Take it off. -What's wrong with your eye, man? -Man, nothing's wrong. Come on. Dude. What, so if I tell you, you don't let me train any more? Nah, man, I put too much into this. I need this. What's up, man? Doctor said I have a partially detached retina. That's why I can't box any more. That sucks, I guess. Does this mean I can't train any more? -Why not? -What about the Beatdown? I ain't your daddy, man. If you wanna risk goin' blind, that's on you. You don't think it's stupid? -Me fighting with my condition? -Of course, it's stupid. But, hey, I ain't done a whole lot of things most folks would agree with. But I can live with my choices as well as my consequences. Can you? Yeah. Well, there it is then. From now on, you're a southpaw. Work that jingle into your footwork. All right? You gotta plan the footwork. There you go. Protect that eye. Keep that eye back. Just like that. Left hand up. Get that asshole! -Now for the next trick. -Calm down, all right! Calm down! Watch what I'm about to do. To a bitch's face. Nobody touches me like that! Hey, hold on, chief. Wait up. -What's up, man? -You made that look easy. Yeah. -You're Vail's kid, right? -Yeah. -I'm here to pick her up. -You know who you are? You're my new head of security. How does $400 a night sound? Sounds great, man. -But on one condition. -What's that? You gotta fire my mom. You got it. Okay. Remember, I told you an angry mind is a narrow mind. Whenever you're angry, you're only thinking about what you can do to somebody. You're not thinking about what can happen to you. Now that's how Justin got you. Isn't anger good for fighting? No. it's about emotional content. Not anger. -Doesn't that anger make you work harder? -No, it just makes you feel like you're working harder. You're actually burning out your mind. And where your mind goes, your body follows. It's better to make your opponent angry, so you can control the fight. The real test for you is to calm your mind. Five, four, three, two, and that's time. All right. Hydrate. Stretch. That means you, Justin. What's wrong with you? I don't know, man. My numbers are thin. I got the diehard fight fans, but that ain't that many tickets sold. I gotta, like, broaden my base somehow. I don't know what to tell you. Save money on venue. Use this place. Thanks. Dude. Dude! Dude, come here. Time out. Check this out. Check this out. Hey, take a photo. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes! Zack, are you crazy? All the training, all the work you've been through. What, you're just gonna quit now? I don't know, man. I just don't see the point any more. So you're not in the Beatdown? Oh, that's too bad. I mean come on dude, really? Dude, I mean, life is looking pretty damn good. Haven't you noticed? Why risk Iosin' my sight? it's stupid. Hi, Zack. I saw your video. -Yeah? What'd you think, beautiful? -I thought it was hot. Thanks, baby. That's real sweet of you. What do you say we get out of here? -What about your girlfriend? -Yeah, what about Eve? -What about her? -I'm just sayin', baby. I'm just sayin', why don't you mind your own fuckin' business, man? I broke it off. You satisfied? What do you say we go to the Champagne Room? Don't wait up, fellas. Hey! What the fuck's your problem? I ain't got no problem. Just cleaned your car. For free. I think you owe me 10 bucks. What the fuck? You don't remember me, do you? Comic book store? You stuck a knife in my belly. So what the fuck you want? I don't know. A kiss. Damn, this isn't your day, boy. You're next, bitch. Does it hurt? Come on dog, look, look, look, we don't want no more, all right, dog! Look, my bad! Look, come on, bro. Look, we were just foolin' around, all right? Come on, dog. It's all good... Just be quiet. I'm not gonna hurt you, I'm not gonna hurt you. I just, I came here to thank you. I wanna thank you for turning me into the beast that I am today. Look we had enough, bro, all right? Oh, but I didn't have enough. -Happy birthday to me. -No, no, no, no, no! You look so fuckin' pretty. I'm a fuckin' beast. Fuck yeah, dude. I got 'em. I got 'em. I buried 'em, man. I went Hiroshima on their asses. Justin, what are you talking about? And where did the blood come from? Dude, the three guys. You should have been there. The three guys that stabbed me. I fuckin' wrecked 'em, I got 'em back. -And you come here? -Well, yeah. You taught me everything. I could've never done this without you. Justin, the cops come looking for you, they're gonna find me. And I'm not going back to prison. Dude, no, you should have been there. It would have got your fuckin' dick hard, I swear. You know what? That's enough of your psycho bullshit. -You're out of here. -What? Find another place to train. Fuck this. -What do you mean? Why? -Get the fuck out, Justin. Where am I gonna train? I train with you. -Get out of here. -No. Come on. What do you mean? No. Get out of here, Justin. And don't come back! Fuck you, Case! Fuck you! Fuck! They fuckin' cheered! Not me! They fuckin' cheered! Macaroni and cheese. See? Yeah, it's pretty good. It's your dad. Seriously, Nlike, you can't keep prolonging things. You know what? I think I'm gonna have the macaroni and cheese. You? Where's the waitress? Waitress! Nlike, it wouldn't hurt to talk about it. Look, not thinking about it is the same as not remembering it, which is the same as it never happened. Listen, Nlike, I'm sorry. But it did happen. And pretending it didn't won't help. What, and talking about it will? I've already talked about it, and look where it got me. Yeah, people found out. I know you have this male tribal, tough guy thing, but I just have to say something. So what, your dad's gay? It's not about him being gay. It's the fact that he left. It's the same as if it were another woman. The fact is, he wanted something more than he wanted us. Just talk to him. No, it's not him. it's about the Beatdown. What? Nothing. it's just the Beatdown. The question is, what do you want? Why exactly are you in this thing? Honestly, I think it's all the sweaty, bare-chested men. You only asked me how many women I've slept with. Stupid. Ifyou would've asked me how many men I've slept with, that desk would've had to have been so much bigger. How big? Get ready for the Beatdown. Get that over there, to the left. Cleaning, all to the right. And you, just go to the left there. Don't forget to lock up. Come in. It's nice. Yes. it's a sellout, dude. Half of them chicks comin' out to get 'em some Zack Gomes. Too bad Zack's not fighting. What? Why the fuck not, dude? -Ask him. -Fuck. One other guys drops out, and now Zack? My brackets are gonna be shot to shit, man. Welcome to the fight promotion game, kid. Fuck. Case. Case, dude, I need you. I need you. -What could I do? -You can fight, man. I'll put you in the first round, light this place up. I don't know why I didn't think of this before, dude. Ten large to the winner. Plus, I got a couple of guys from Strikeforce coming, scouting new talent. This could be your ticket back to the show, killer. I got no time for this, man. What the fuck, dude? You got nothin' but time. Why not fight? Fight who? The guys I've been training? The guys who gave me the gym? You need to get a soul, little man. Sorry. Is that your mom and dad? Katrina? Yeah. Man, Katrina feels like it was yesterday. It's been yesterday for six years. My father was a professional boxer. Had a few pro fights, and never went far, but he got a chance to spar with Floyd Patterson. I have four brothers, and I was the only one that followed in my father's footsteps. I was the youngest. Man, he was my biggest supporter, my biggest fan. My parents had me late in life. I think they were just holding on to see me make something out of myself. That flood, man, that wasn't supposed to happen, man. They were supposed to be around to watch me become... After that damn flood, man, I was... I just lost all faith. And I was in a bad head space. Probably shouldn't have been anywhere where there was trouble. But I go out in aclub. Guy starts a fight with me, I finish it. Once the judge hears my background, I get the maximum. You know what my lawyer tells me? Said if I had shot the guy, I would've gotten off with self-defence. Ain't that some bullshit? Justice system is bullshit. Well, Case, I better go in light of this whole Zack fiasco. But I don't know what you believe, but I believe your parents are still watching. I'll see ya, man. Fuck me. Come on. Elijah Walker. We got a report. And I'm gonna have to ask you to hold it right there. You know the drill. Why am I being arrested? Well, you ain't exactly being arrested just yet, but we're gettin' there. You mind if we search your residence? You got a warrant? A warrant? Now why would I need a warrant? I just asked you nicely if we could search your residence and you just said, "Yes," clear as day. And these fine officers all heard you. Let's go. Put your hands on the car. It's procedure, you know that. You mean, just like illegal search? Dude, believe me, you don't want to give him an excuse. Well, it looks like I got you now, convict. A felon in possession of a firearm. That's five years mandatory. You planted that gun. What'd you say, you piece of shit? I ain't gotta plant no gun to get rid of your black ass. You done lost your manners, boy. Hold his ass. -Fuck! -I said, hold his ass still! No, no, no. He's cuffed. Case! Let's go, man, I got it all on tape! Holy shit! We gotta get you to the Feds. Are you crazy? What if they destroy the tape? We'd have no evidence. Case, roughly 2,000 people are watching that thing right now. This is ridiculous. This is the third frickin' office that we've been to. I wish we knew someone influential. Hey. Why don't you call your girlfriend? Maybe she can blow somebody. Hey, cut that shit out. You two need to put this on the shelf until we figure out what to do here. You guys are killin' me! It's two hours to the Beatdown! We've been here all frickin' day! Nlax, calm the fuck down, all right? Ifyou don't want to be here, just go, man. Dude. I'm stayin' right here, man. Are any of you guys affiliated with a Justin Epstein? Yeah. He's a psycho that used to train with us. But Case kicked him out for being, well, psycho. Well, it turns out only Justin's prints were on the weapon. His dad reported the gun stolen last night. Did Justin fuckin' set Case up? You know where we can find him? No, man. Wait, wait. So, is Case free to go? I'm afraid not. Fortunately, the video speaks for itself. As does the motive for planting the gun. But there are other issues involving Mr Walker's parole requirements that he still needs to answer for. We know where Justin will be. Nlax, I'm back in. His ass is mine. Not if I get to him first. Yes! Yes! Go get him, Mike. -What's up, Tim? -How's it going, Zack? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the motherfuckin' Beatdo wn!

That's gotta be the quickest fight in Beatdown history! How's the family? So I guess you heard about Case, right? Take him out of the ghetto, but... No, you can't take him out of the ghetto.

Three shots to the body! Big shot! What's up, Tim? You son of a bitch!

Big round of applause out there! Make some noise! For both your fighters! We don't know where Tim Newhouse is, but here's his opponent, Justin Epstein! Still looking for Newhouse. Can someone find Newhouse? We're looking for Newhouse. Newhouse to the ring. Or to the cage. Immediately. -What happened? -Justin cracked my fucking knee. Chill, dude. You can't even walk.
