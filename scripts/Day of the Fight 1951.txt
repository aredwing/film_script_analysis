o'clock on the morning of the fight Begins the taughest part of being a boxer The waiting Walter is on the right of Vincent his identical twin He soesn't mind the hard training The four miles of road work everyday, as much as the waiting Walter knows that each bout is more important than the one before Because he is rapidly climbing the middleweight championship of the world And he must keep winning It's a long way until night Walter wearing the bow tie is 24 He's a native of New York And a fighter as far back as he can remember His father is away And when he was a little boy he lost his mother Walter began to do exibition boxing with his brother Vincent when they were 3 years old During the war they fought exibitions in the navy Where they were in the same outfit together Now through the quite morning streets of New York The two boys walk to morning mass It's important for Walter to get Holy Communion In case something should go wrong tonight At Walter's three room apartment where he lives with his aunt Vincent is serving him breakfast He's a lawer and Walter's manager Vinc lives in New Jersey But in the slow hours before the fight he's staying with his brother Now they live as they used to years ago The two boys And Walter's dog At noon Walter gets a complete examination from the commission doctor If he's not in perfect condition the doctor can call off the fight but this doesn't trouble walter What bothers him is the whole days waiting Of which this is a part Sometimes he thinks of the man who don't pass And he knows that he must And he does Meat is vital to Walter It gives him the raw energy he needed for fighting Dan Stampler owns the resturant Where Walter comes to eat every day Often sitting proudly like this with the boy He thinks will be the champion This is Walter's second and final meal before the match Walter has a knock out punch in either hand And he's one of the host hitting middlewieghts in the ring He moves around his apponent Jabbing, shifting, looking for an oppening Then finishing the fight with one exploding punch He's won almost half of his Now at four o'clock, It would be six hours Until he enters the ring to try for his thirty six No one ever told Walter to be a fighter His family was against it But he just had the feeling for it On this day the people around him Feel the pain and fear But for Walter the bad part is the waiting for the thing that happen Soon it's coming He'll be glad when it's finally here His boxing gear has been carfully laid off for the ride to the arena And he's ready to be packed The time draws near and Walter prepares to go Above everything else in the world Walter Cartier wants to be champion Unlike a lot of people he's got something to move towards All the time And that thing is the championship Nothing is going to keep him back from it He goes ahead and he never stops The fight Walter's riding to now In a friends car, may bring him nearer to the middleweight crown When it's over, there will be another one coming along And another one after that Always it's fighting and training and fighting again But always there's the goal At 8 o'clock in the small hot dressing room Behind the arena Walter moves in to the last two hours of preparation In these hours he can feel his body tightening But it's tightness that does not come from the lack of comfidence Its the presure of the last waiting Here in a place where the walls are so close A man can barely moves his body around If only the fight was on Then everything else will not be so bad Not really bad at all Bobby James is the man he's going to be fighting in one hour Walter has never seen him before But when the fight is over They will know a lot about each other Bobby has been on the ring with many of the top middlewieghts And has never been counted out That's something to think about At a time like this It's almost as if the brothers were going into the ring together Time is a strange thing When you have a little of it And you want it to last It scatters away in all directions and you never know where it's gone But in a way that's gone pretty quickly for a couple of boys It's only when you want the hours to go like now That time has a way of staring you in the face as it barely moves along But there isn't much of it left now Before the main event goes on And everything is here at last As he gets ready to walk out to the arena And the three thousand people who are there Walter is slowly becoming another man This is the man who can not lose, Who Must not lose The hard movements of his arms and fists Are different from what they were an hour ago They belong to the fierce new person They are part of the arena man The Walter Cartier that the crowd outside is going to see In 15 minutes A few moments are left He can almost hear the commissioner coming down the hall to call him He's done it, he has K.Oed Bobby James This is a fighter Walter Cartier He has just moved up one more place in a line That may end with the championship It's a hard life But to him it's worth all the hardship and the risk To him it's worth everything
