It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay. Please. I need to know if he's on the other bus. - We can check when we stop, ma'am. - But my son. Ma'am... Alpha One, this is Alpha Two, over. One, this is Two. Do you copy? Why are we stopped short at the gate? Over. Alpha One, this is Alpha... What the fuck? What's happening? You have to tell us what's happening. Open the door. It's all fine. Everyone stay in the seat and quiet. Open the door. And close it behind me. No one gets on or off till I get back. Alpha Two, do you copy? Alpha Two, do you copy? Alpha Two, do you copy? - Open the door. - Yeah. I don't think that's a good idea. Okay. Close the door behind me... Patrick. We need to protect ourselves. That soldier out there's got two guns. I don't know. Maybe we should sit tight, man. I'm going out. You got my back. Come on. Let me go. Quick. What's happening? No, no, no. Patrick. Emma. Emma. - Emma. - Stop... It's me, it's me, it's me. Emma. Where's Emma? No. No. No. No. Leave me alone. No. No. No. No. Jack. Jack. It's okay. I got her. It's okay. I got her. You're okay. - Jack. - Emma. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - No, no, no. - Baby, stop. - She's bleeding. - Oh, shit. - What's that? - I don't know. It's not hers. It's not hers. Get away from the window, please. He killed another animal. Time for homework. I can't remember what real meat tastes like anymore. Photo. Photosynthesis. - Can you spell it? - F-O... F. What other letters make the sound "F"? - P-H? - Very good. Patrick Thornton here... broadcasting out of Harmony on 109.9. Can anybody read me? Now, that is a real shame. Because we've got a very special show... in store for you today on Radio Harmony. Chock-full of contests, interviews... fantastic musical numbers. So let's begin with today's guests. How you doing, John Doe? "I'm doing good, Patrick. Really good." And so tell me, John. Are you happy? "Of course, Patrick. Why wouldn't I be?" Well, maybe because you haven't talked to anybody for nine years... besides your stupid dog. All right. Let's get to the weather: The forecast for tonight is cold. Tomorrow, cold. The day after tomorrow, cold. Next year... Well, let's move on to the question-and-answer contest. Now, this first one is easy. Whoever gets it right wins an all-expense-paid trip... to the end of the fucking earth. And the crowd goes crazy with anticipation. All right. Now, here's the question: Where the hell is everybody? Good night, Lu. Lu? You know I don't like it when you go downstairs without telling me. I didn't wanna wake you. Anyway, I'm big now. There are bedtimes you need to follow. You'll be big... when I tell you you're big. Can I have another cookie? I'm still hungry. But that was... You're not hungry, you're bored. When you're finished, brush your teeth, or you won't get any more cookies. - I don't like brushing my teeth. It hurts. - Because you don't brush your teeth. No, I don't like brushing my teeth because it hurts. It hurts because you don't brush your teeth. Okay... Yeah. I'm coming. Hey, doggy. Hey, buddy. Did you miss me? Did you miss me? I saw a really cool episode yesterday. Ramble asked Mamble out. She said no. Because he didn't bring her flowers. I'd already seen it, but it was funnier this time. Hey, doggy. Did you do this? Did you dig the hole yourself? Good boy. Now I can give you cookies even better. Just don't tell Dad. He'll cover it back up. No. Where the hell do you run off to every morning anyway? Yeah. Two times five. Ten. Five times three. Fifteen? Nine times 14. No counting on your fingers. No counting on your fingers. - Dad, how did you know? - I know everything. Well? You know this. - Hey, Dad? - Yeah? I think it's recess time. Few more minutes. All right. Hey, Dad? Can I shoot? I already told you no. What? I said it's not a kiddie game. Then stop shooting and come play with me. I'm bored. You don't like playing with your dollies? I'm too big to be playing with dolls. Oh, yeah? Who told you that? Too big, huh? What do you wanna play? How about I be the teacher, and you be my student? Okay. You again, Jack. And you didn't do your homework this time... because you think you're Mr. Big Shot. I'm really sorry, ma'am. I'm... - It won't happen again. - Dad, do it right. In a kid's voice. I'm sorry, ma'am. It won't happen again. Dad, I said do it in a kid's voice. Not a squirrel one. I ate a squirrel. That's why I sound like this. I have a squirrel in my tummy. He'd like some food. He's hungry. He likes little girls. He wants to eat little girls alive. I eat everything. Dad... I'm hungry. All done. Face and teeth, Daddy. We should get her new flowers. - What is it? - Open it. Cool. Who's that? That's your mom when she was really young. All these things were hers. But why are you giving me all these today? You don't know what today is? Today... Is it my birthday already? Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday to you How about you take it to her? Because I'm pretty damn sure Jack wouldn't open the fucking door to me. The last dog alive. And the stupidest one. - House. - No. - Loud. - Nope. No. I give up. - It's mouse. - Mouse? - That's wasn't a mouse. - That was so a mouse. Before there were lots of kids at birthdays, right? Absolutely, and you can invite anybody you want. They all brought you presents? But is it true... or just a story? Why would I make something like that up? I don't know, it's just, I've never seen any other kids before. Don't even remember ever seeing Mom. Honey, I'm telling you the truth. And your mom, you knew her. You were just little. That's why you can't remember. Now that I'm grown up... you can tell me the truth. Do the monsters really exist? They did. But there are no more left. They all died from the cold. I'm cold, though, and I'm not dead. Well, that's because you're a very strong young lady. - And grown-up. - And... No, not grown-up. - Oh, I'm very grown-up. - Very grown-up. Grown-ups dance. Come on, honey. Come on, Lu. Spin. That's all for today. This is 109.9. Somebody fucking answer me. Hello? Hello, this is... This is Patrick Thornton in Harmony. I'm 109.9. Do you read me? Hello? Hello? Do you hear me? Hello? Do you read me? Hello? Lu? What are you doing under there? Would you come out here, please? Lu, come out here. Lu. All right. Move over. I'm coming in. Come on. Scooch over. Now will you tell me what you're doing under here? I saw a monster last night. Out the window. What did it look like? Like Ramble... but really white instead of Grey. And no hair. Claws too. Oh, and fangs. I think. Honey, that was a bad dream. You were having a nightmare. No. First, I had the nightmare, then I woke up and saw the monster. You said so yourself that before, there were monsters that killed mom. And all those monsters have died from the cold. And they didn't look like Ramble. If they all died... then why do you keep so many locks on the door? You never let me go out. Not even to get food with you from the other houses. Do you wanna go with me to get some food? Okay. Okay. Let's go down to the kitchen and get some food. Come on. Wait, what? Okay, bunny. I need you to not let anybody but doggy in this hole. Okay? Thank you. Come on. So... you're the one. The one responsible for my dog's daily disappearing act. If you give him too many treats, he could go blind. The... The dog, he... You can... You can eat as many cookies as you'd like. Get away from her. Don't you look at her. Don't you come near her. Don't you talk to her. You shut that dog up... or I swear to God, I will put a bullet in him. No, doggy's my friend. Dog. Dog, shut up. Come on. Dog. Jesus, Patrick. Quit making noise or they'll catch us. That what you say to Jack? "Don't make too much noise, or Patrick will catch us"? You and Jack... Dog. Come on. Dog. Dog, quiet. Dog. Dog, run. Run. Dog. Go, go, go. Come on. Come on, Dog. Come on, Dog. Run. Come on. Come on. It's too heavy. Hold with both hands. This is your sight. Like your finger... - aim right at the bottle. - Okay. Put your finger on the trigger. Squeeze it. I can't. Hold on. Take your finger off. Okay. Wait. Okay. Aim at the bottle. Squeeze the trigger. A little harder. That was so much fun, Daddy. Can I do it again? Can I, Daddy? Please? Now, next time, what I want you to do... You see it? Can I shoot it? How hungry are you? You better do it this time. Stay there. Jack. Hey. Run, Jack. Lu, are you all right? Look at me. You okay, baby? Are you hurt? Get in the house. Get in the house now. Go on. Get behind the gate. Shoot it. Lock the gate, and get in the house. Now. Shoot. No. - Honey, are you okay? - Get off me. - No. - Get off me. Get off me. Honey, calm down. Honey, hey. Listen. Listen up. Listen to me. Honey. Listen to me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Lu, honey. Hey. What did I tell you about playing the hero, huh? What did I tell you? No. No. No. Fuck me. Do it. Do it, Patrick. Do it. Do it. Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you read me? Oh, God. Can you read me? Are you out there? Hello? Yeah. I read you. Oh, thank God. For a minute there, I dreamt I'd never made contact with someone. Yeah. Me too. Well, where are you? In Harmony. - It's in the... - I know it. It's not so far from where we are. They're back. We thought they were all dead, but they're... They're back. They infected me. What? But... You were bitten? When was it? This morning. Too much time has gone by, you'd be one of them by now. You're not infected. I'm gonna kill it. I'm gonna go out there... and I'm gonna kill that... - That creature, whatever it is. I'm... - Patrick. That creature isn't responsible for what happened today. The neighbour could've helped you, but he didn't. He's got the girl, and now you've got nothing. What are you gonna do about it? What? Who are you? You're a liar. Last night you said the neighbour would turn into a monster... because he got bit. But it's not true. That's impossible. That thing... That thing bit him. Why'd you break my watch, Lu? So, you wouldn't know what time it is. That monster was the same one I saw the other night... and you didn't believe me. Honey, can we call a truce? What's a truce? A truce is when you forgive someone for a little while. You always liked a second cookie in the morning. The second cookie was for doggy. Honey, please. What's gonna happen when you're real old? Will I have to ask permission to go out then too? I'm tired of living my life locked up. I've never been out of this house. You never let me do anything. I wanna go pick new flowers for my mom. - If you're afraid, I'll go myself. - Can't go out. Can't go outside. Those things... I don't know what they are, but, honey, the monsters are back. But they're flowers for Mom. I bet the neighbour would do it. Are you there, Patrick? Answer, Patrick. Who are you? Patrick, are you there? Patrick? Who the fuck are you? Patrick, the time is now. You got your rifle ready last night. The decision's been made. I am not a murderer. I am not going to kill Jack. Yes, you are. Don't you dare turn your back on me. - Shut up. - No, you shut up. Don't make me hurt you. You had the balls to let Emma die... and now you feel bad for that son of a bitch, you piece of shit. Candy ass. You don't even have the balls to shoot a goddamn radio. What will happen to the girl? Lu, there are no flowers left. Then I won't call a truce. But I found these. Even better. Now they won't droop. Thank you. Thanks for watching, bunny. I'll be back soon. Promise. Lu? Lu? Lu. No. No, no. Wait. Over here. Hey. Lu, baby? Oh, honey. Look at me, baby. Look at me. Lu? Lu? Lu? Lu? Where the hell you going this time of night? It's the creature that attacked you. Think there'll be more? Who are you? I've been keeping watch with binoculars. - What are you doing? - There's no sign of them. Check this out. Thought the fucker would bleed out and die. Tell me where Lu is, Patrick. Fucking sealed up the wounds in just a few hours. We thought they were dying, but they're evolving. They adapted to their environment. Teeth. Claws. Hard skin for resisting cold. Evolution like that takes millions of years. It took this thing nine. - What happened to Lu? - It's not all bad. Neither one of us got infected. The contagious strain is gone. Gives us a fighting chance, right? Totally blind. Locate their prey by sound alone. Don't know how many are out there. - We're gonna have to be ready. - What happened to Lu? How long before this thing starves to death? Couple of weeks, a month. These fuckers are tougher than the first. Where's Lu, Patrick? Daddy? - How did you...? You okay, Lu? - I'm sorry. - It's okay, baby. - Patrick took care of me. - It's okay. It's okay, baby. - I'm fine. - Are you hurt? Let me look at you. - I'm... I'm okay. - It's okay, baby. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... Are you cold? Are you hungry? Patrick? Are you there? Patrick. Patrick. Listen to me. You... Hello? Hello? Neighbour Patrick? Hello? Neighbour Patrick? - Yes? - Dad. Hey, he answered. Come on. I wanted to invite you over for dinner tomorrow night. I mean, if you can, of course. Can you, Neighbour Patrick? Yes, Lu. That... I would like that very much. What time should I come? How about after my cartoon? Okay, Lu. I will... I will see you then. I promise. Okay. Bye, Neighbour Patrick. Christ. I didn't know what to bring, so... You don't drink anymore, do you? Me either. Lu, come on down. This is yours. That's a... - It's a gift for Lu. - I figured. What I mean is, I don't play with these things. Hi, Neighbour Pat... Neighbour? - Aren't those fancy. - I know. They're like my mom's, but without the holes. It's for your birthday. Look, Dad. It's the one I wanted. I thought you were getting too old to play with dolls. How'd you know it was the dolly I liked the best? I just figured. I sure liked them when I was a kid. Okay. So be honest. What else did you like when you were a kid? Lots of stuff. Toy soldiers. I had a whole bucket of them. And then robots like Mazinger. But more than anything, playing hockey with my buddies. You were a lucky duck. All I get to play with is my dolls. There's gotta be a kid or two out there somewhere. - There's gotta be someone somewhere. - My dad says there's not any. Are you scared of the monsters? Of course he's scared of the monsters. That's why he protects himself. And we'll be safe as long as we protect ourselves. Yeah, but he's braver. Now that you two are friends, you can go hunt animals with my dad, right? So we can have real food more often. I think that's a good idea. I can help your dad hunt... and he can help me go get ammunition... and other supplies in the store. What do you think? I think you don't need my dad's help to go into town. You, when you were a kid, did you know how to add and subtract? Well, not much. I tell you what, not much now neither. Well, I do. My dad taught me. Watch. Three plus two is five. Six plus one is seven. Eight plus four is...? Come on. It's easy. No counting on your fingers. That's cheating. It's 12, Neighbour Patrick, 12. I'm glad to know your dad is good for something. What about geography? Did you know about geography? Let's see. In what country is the Great Wall of China? Oh, gosh. - Mexico. - Nope. China. Do you know what language they speak? Chinese. Very good. - Do you know what the population is? - Right now? What is it? What's so funny? Why are you laughing? Oh, shit. Dad, he said a swear word. If you swear, people think badly of you. - I know. I know. - Right, Dad? - I know. - They will. It's important what people think about us. Yeah. Well, especially the Chinese. Goddamn Chine... And then E.T.'s heart started to beat again. And the plant that looked like it was dead... came back to life. That's a nice story. Meanwhile, Elliott and his friends... planned E.T.'s rescue. And she's out like a light. - Should I take her up? - I'll handle it. Another night where she goes to sleep without brushing her teeth. Not a tragedy. I don't like it when she disobeys. It's normal. I'm sure you were rebellious at her age too. It'd be normal if we were living in a normal world. Disobeying is dangerous here. She's a lot like her mother. She has nothing of her father in her. I'm sorry about your dog, Patrick. - I don't know what came over me. - It's all right. I know what it's like to have weird things come over you. These things are back. I haven't forgotten what happened or what you did. But I can't do this alone. Not with Lu. You can count on me. For anything. That truck we were gonna take back before Emma... I think I can get it working. What? - We're not going anywhere. - What, are you planning... on staying here and waiting for more to come? What makes you think more are coming? The fuck are you saying? They're coming. If it's not today, it'll be tomorrow or next week, but they're back. Shit. You're worried about her brushing her teeth... instead of her living her life cooped up in this prison. There is no future here, Jack. You lower your voice, or you will wake her up. We are safe here. We can protect ourselves here. We have no idea what's on the other side. That's the problem, Jack. We don't know shit. You have been so hell-bent on surviving... that you have forgotten how to live. Oh, if you're so damn sure, why the hell haven't you left already? This dinner was a bad idea. This was her thing. Go. I'm grateful for how you raised her. - Emma would also... - No. No. Don't you talk about Emma. Not in this house. I'm sorry. What are you actually sorry about? Just go. What did you do? Emma's... Do you know what you've done? The infected are all gone. They're not... Drunk son of a bitch. Fuck off. It's okay. It's okay. Where is she? - What? - Emma. Where is she? You fucking killed her. Fuck. Fuck you. You're no longer her father. Dad. What? Lu, what is it? What? Baby, you were having a bad dream. Hey. It's okay. The monsters can't hurt you anymore. I... I didn't dream about the monster. You died, and I was left here all alone. I don't wanna be alone, Daddy. - I thought I was big, but I'm not. - It's okay. - I'm not. I'm not. - Okay, okay, okay. You got room for two more? Daddy. Dad. Dad, do you see this? Look, Neighbour Patrick. Look. Look at all those trees. See this? Come on. Look. Lu, stay close. Lu needs a father, not a drunk. You... You and Jack... Patrick. Is this where you got the dolls from TV? There's only one way to find out. Jack, give me a hand. Lu? Lu? Lu, wait for me. Dad. I think there's something out there. Are you okay? Hey. No. No. No. Get in the truck. Get in the truck. It's okay. Calm the fuck down. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. She's in shock. Her clothes are soaking wet. - All right. - Yeah. Come on. Sweetie, go downstairs. - But I don't wanna be alone. - Go downstairs now. Do not disobey me. Go. Is that woman gonna die? No. No, she just got very cold, and that made her sick. She's gonna be okay. - So there are other people in the world? - Yeah. It looks that way. Kids too? I don't know. We could ask her if she gets better. Now, that sounds like a good idea. Did you like my mom too? It's just you have so many pictures of her... up in your room. We don't even have that many at home. I think that's why you and my daddy keep fighting. It is, isn't it? You are a... A very clever girl. And when my mom chose my dad... I bet you were pretty sad. But weren't there other pretty girls for you? None as pretty as your mother. She's stabilised... but she is running a fever. It's hot. I'm gonna go out and check the fence. You have to do what I tell you. Please. She was delirious. Said dozens of creatures attacked them. See anything? I hadn't noticed that for so long. What? It's okay. We were shut up in our house... for over a year. My parents, my brothers and I, we just stayed there... because of what we heard on the radio before the blackout. Then what happened? Then... Then we left our house and headed north... in just abandoned cars we found along the way. And... living in all kinds of places. And we found little cells of survivors. People like you all. And I met a guy in one of these groups... and I got pregnant. Although, he never had the chance to know it. And... about a few weeks ago, we... We hooked up with about a dozen others... and created a three-car convoy. We heard a radio broadcast out of this valley... and thought that maybe things weren't so bad here. Why did you leave your house? Because... that was no longer living. I mean, we're human beings. What about you? How long have you been here? Do you know how to braid? Lu. Yeah. I'd like to go to China. It's really, really big. Well... I'd like to go to China too. Yeah. They say it's a very beautiful place. What is it? Is there really a baby in there? Yeah. There is. And... well, you know, when... When he's born, you'll have to help take care of him. - Would you like that? - Yes. You'll be able to play together and be friends. They're here. They're here. - No. No, we captured one. It's harmless. - What? Yeah. It's harmless. I'm telling you. Completely. Hey. That's how they fucking call to each other. What the hell is going on? Now, we're all gonna die. No one is gonna die. Hey, you. - That's a nice doll. What's his name? - Lu doesn't deserve this. I call him Randy. Look. I'm sorry. Sorry for everything that's happened. It's not my forgiveness you need. What...? Lu, sweetie, for once in your life, just obey Daddy. I need you to go downstairs. Listen to me. Lu, listen to me. Daddy needs to help get the monsters out of the house. I can't do that if I don't know you're safe. The windows, they're small, monsters cannot get in. Listen, they won't get in. - Gonna shut the door, walk downstairs. - Daddy. And no matter what happens, you don't make a sound. All right? You understand? That's right, sweetheart. That's right. That way they can't hear you. Okay. So, you just... And when this is all over, Daddy is gonna open the door. Okay? You'll be fine. You'll be fine. No. Patrick. I think they're inside the walls. Lu? Honey, are you there? Lu? Drop dead. Lu. I don't like the basement. There's a monster, and he tried to hurt me. That's why I need you... - to stay right here. - No. Everybody can see each other right here. Okay? You'll be safe here. Where's my dad? Your dad... Your dad is upstairs, and he's gonna be down any minute. I need you to stay here. Stay away from the doors... and the windows, and everything's gonna be okay. Hello? Do you read me? We're broadcasting from Spring Falls. This is not a pre-recorded message. Lu? Lu, what are you doing here? Are you hurt? - Dad. Dad. - Now stay here. Don't move. - More fuel? - Yeah, but the generator's out too far. More ammo? Not enough. Shit. Give me some fucking light. Right here. Hurry. I won't let them hurt her. - Dad. - It's okay, baby. Baby, listen to me. I want you to close your eyes and think of Mom. - Dad. - Close your eyes, baby. Close your eyes and think of Mom. And when you see her... - the monsters will be gone. - Dad. And when you see her, the monsters are gone. And when you see her, the monsters are gone. No, Dad. They said you have to shoot them in the head to kill them. Who? The woman on the radio. They said it before everything turned off. - Where's Spring Falls? - Some 50 miles from here. - They said we have to go there. - Yeah. That's right. We heard that too. No. It's too far. We'll never make it. I'm gonna draw them away from the house. And when it's clear, you get to the truck... but don't start it. Not until I give you the signal. What's going on? He's drawing them away from the house. Lu, listen to me. There's something I need to tell you. When this is all over... no matter what... No matter what, always brush your teeth before bedtime. Okay? And now we're gonna kick these monsters out of here, princess. Right here. I'm right here. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm right here. Come on. Right here. I'm right here. Come on. Come on. Right here. Right here. Come on. That's right, fuckers. Come on. Come on. All right. All right, now. Come on. Come on, now. Come on. I know you're all cosy inside. But I really... We really wanna meet you, little girl, so don't get too comfortable in there. Hey, don't say that. I'm not talking to you. Now, you gotta come out soon. And I hope, for your sake... that you look like your mother. Because right now, there is nothing more beautiful. Lu. Look. Look, Dad. I can see China. Now what?
