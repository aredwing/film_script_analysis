We talked on the phone from the hospital, right? Yes, we called as soon as we heard. We tried to come and see you, but... but they wouldn't let us until the test came back. So, here you are. Okay. Hi. Hi. Well, charges have been pressed, and McKay will be held without bail. So far, her hospital records are clean, although she did refuse to take a full examination. That's private. Of course. As discussed, she's to meet with a court-appointed psychologist once a week, more if needed. Dr. Andrews... here's her card. This should calm down. We petitioned for a protective order on your behalf, and that should be settled by tomorrow. Thank you. I only wish we could have met sooner. Thank you. Take care of yourself. Can I hug you? Um... sure. You're real... you're really here. Welcome home. Is it okay if we stop hugging? Yes, of course. You're so big. Would you like something to drink? I have lemonade. And tea. Water. Coming right up. Please, make yourself comfortable. Here, let me... I'll take... No. Okay. Is this you? Yes. And him? Yes. And this. This is me, then. Yes. There you go. You look so young. I was. I rode horses. Ponies. You had just started. You were barely four. But you kept asking, and your friend Caroline had had some lessons, so of course you couldn't let it go. Do you remember Caroline? No. Your birthdays were ten days apart, so we always had joint parties. We had costume parties, it being so close to Halloween. You were always a princess for your birthday and something else for Halloween. Isn't my birthday March 15th? No, it's October 21st. I celebrate it on March 15th. You see... Um... Yeah, here's another one. So you're about to, um, blow out the candles, and here are the pumpkins and leaves on the ground. Oh. We made a cheese plate, if you're hungry. And there's a pie in the oven. Do you still like pie? Sure. Please, sit, and make yourself comfortable, and let us know if... if we can get you anything. Leanne. Leanne is here. Actually, my name is Leia. - Huh? - What? My name is Leia. You changed your name? No. We... we named you Leanne. We've always called you that. I don't remember that. I only know that my name is Leia and that I was named after a princess. Like from the movie? What movie? You don't know? Know what? Your name. It's Leia. Leia. Yes? No, I was just saying it. Your name. So tell us about yourself. I'm tired. Oh, would you like to lay down? Yes. Oh, you can go right up to your room. We didn't have time to change anything, but we kept it like this for you. I hope it's okay. Maybe it's nice, even. For now. Okay. All right, I'm gonna let you get settled in. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. I'd like to propose a toast. To Leanne. To Leia. We're so happy to have you home. It's a miracle. Thank you. I'm sorry, are we being rude? Are you saying Grace? I'm doing a "Dear Universe. " It's a kind of prayer. "Dear Universe, thank you "for the food I'm going to be eating, "the thoughts I'm going to be thinking. Thank you for this moment we are making. " And then you make wishes. Wishes? Yes. "I wish for you to keep me honest, help me to know who I am," and anything else you want. "Sincerely, Leia. " And you can add a P.S. if you feel necessary. What church is that? No church. Church is for people who can't believe in themselves. The Universe is for when you believe in everything. Thank you. You must be hungry. Been quite a few days. The police, the hospital... Hospital food can't be that good. And all the beeping. Who can eat with all that beeping? I remember when I was at the hospital after I had had you. And they brought me some food, and I couldn't even recognize it. It was like astronaut food, I swear. The only thing that I would eat was the Jell-O... I remember that. Because the rest of it was just so... No, I remember that, because I had a pack of Rollo's in my pocket that you went absolutely nuts for. - That's right, that's right. - I mean, she went bananas. Well, I was starving. I'd never seen anybody... I was starving, because... Go through a half a pack of Rollo's before like that. Because after you give birth, they should have a turkey dinner waiting for you. Hello? Hi. Yeah, she's right here. It's Jill. Hello? Great. Thank you. Uh-huh. I know. I know, I was thinking the same thing. She would be so happy. Would you like to talk to her? Hold on. Um, Leia, this is your Aunt Jill on the phone. Why don't you say hello? So... so say hello. Hello? Okay. Congratulations for you too. Okay. I think she's done talking. Oh, okay. I should go. Hello... already? Okay. Jill? Yeah, she's tired. I'll see you tonight. - I'll see you tonight. - Of course. Okay, so would you describe your first week at home as a positive experience? Sure. I notice you say that a lot. "Sure. " We just met. Yes, but over the last half hour, "Would you like to sit?" "Can I get you some tea?" "Have you been sleeping on a regular schedule?" "Do you find yourself adapting to your new surroundings?" All these are things you answered "sure" to. Maybe you should ask different questions. Maybe you're right. How would you describe your first week at home? As a positive experience. Do I make you uncomfortable? No. Do I make you uncomfortable? Of course not. Okay. "Sure" is a noncommittal statement, even in the affirmative. If I say, "Do you want some tea?" and you say, "Sure," it tells me that you want tea only because I asked it, not because you want it. I want you to feel free to express definites, concrete feelings. This is a safe environment. Okay. I don't really want this tea. Everything you say here is confidential. You keep writing things in that folder. I keep notes. But you are looking for things, right? Against Ben. Are you concerned about Ben? Are you looking for things? My only true concern is how you are doing, how you are feeling, that you feel supported. Okay. If there's anything I can do to make that clearer to you, do not hesitate to tell me. I am here for you. Can you stop calling it "home?" Like, my "transition back home?" All right. Does it not feel like home? Would a place you don't remember feel like home to you? How does it feel? Like a place I don't remember, like a neighbor's house. Did you spend much time at neighbor's houses when you were with Mr. McKay? No. I spent time at home. Want some dessert? You don't have to look at that. It's just... it's just there. Can I have this? No. Or not right now, okay? Congratulations, God bless. I've been following on the news and everything from the very beginning. - So inspiring. - Thank you. You are so inspiring. You must be so happy to be home. You holding up okay? Fine, thanks. Oh, I bet you are. Just excuse me. You are in our prayers. I hope that monster gets everything he deserves. Don't you worry. Thank you, thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. I'm sorry about that. People have a lot of questions, and sometimes it gets the better of them. Questions about what? Well... about you and how you're doing, what you went through... how you survived. Survived what? The unknown, I guess. I could ask everyone else the same question. You're ruining it! You're ruining everything! Hey, don't say that. Ruiner! Leia, that's not very nice. You are not very nice. Yeah? Who else do you know that's nicer, huh? No one. That's right. You're hurting him! Let's take him to the hospital. He has to go to the hospital. Leia, we both know he can't go to a hospital. And why? - But he has to... - Leia. Hospitals are bad. Yes. And why? You can't just say something is bad without knowing why. They have no confidence in the nature of things and no respect for the mystery of life. Yeah. And part of the mystery of life is death. And part of the nature of things is accepting that. I don't want him to die. Well, look who's lost confidence in me, huh? Are you ready for a story? Which one should I read? How about The Frog Prince? You can follow... He's fixed. You fixed him. That's what I told you I was doing. I thought you were hurting him, like a doctor. No, I was fixing him, like a Ben. Look at you. You're a mess. I'm not a mess. You get so worked up. Sorry. No, you don't have to apologize. We can't help what we feel. But we can help what we think, right? So why would you think I would hurt Teddy? I don't know. You don't know what you think? I thought you were mad at me. Why would I be mad at you? For looking out the window. I was concerned when you were looking out the window, yeah. I didn't want you to see something scary. But I fixed it, right? So, we don't have to worry about that anymore. I know. But you yelled. Even if I was mad, I take care of you. Always. Okay. Okay. How long does it take trees to grow? Maybe 30, 40 years. This has looked like this for 40 years? More than that, actually, because we moved here almost 25 years ago, and the trees were big then too. Why does Glen get to leave? Well, he goes to work. We could leave too. What do you think? You could try it on. Sure. Oh, that looks so pretty. Do you like it? Do you want to try it without the other shirts underneath? I always wear these. Would to try it? Now... How is that one? That's... that's not as tight as the other one, right? Good. Do you want me to adjust it? It's adjustable back here. - No. - No? Okay, great. Great. Well, I think that should work better under the clothes. I can do it. Okay. Okay. Don't... don't forget... don't forget to come out and show me. If... if you want to. It was... it was really nice. I think she liked the clothes that we found. She looked great in them, really beautiful. I hope she liked them. Good. See? It's good. Yeah, it's good. She's... She's sweet. Dear Universe, thank you for the thoughts I'm going to be thinking. Thank you for the dreams I'm going to be dreaming. Thank you for this moment we are making. I wish for you to keep me honest and to keep an eye on Ben. Sincerely, Leia. Leia? Good morning. Leia? Leia! Leia. - Yes. - Oh, my God. I... I... I... I didn't see you out there. - Don't do that. - Sorry. - Don't do that. - Sorry. You know what we're gonna do today? We're gonna get you an ID card so that... so that you have an ID card. Okay. Salem, Pennsylvania. Department of Motor Vehicles. What does "Louise" mean? It's your middle name. It's work. Okay. Whatever it is, I think we should just try to be more... than we were. We already are. We already are more than we were. Leia? You okay in there? Oh, oh, okay, okay, I'll get it. - Sorry. - No, no, no, no, no. It's alright. Here. Careful. I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it. There we go. It's all fine, it's all fine. I like the bread warm. That's okay. How do we... let's see. I like it toasty, sorry. That's all right. It'll... it'll go off in just a second. This happens all the time. There we go. Okay. There we go. - Sorry. - No, that's fine. So... for next time, there's a toaster. You know. So you could toast the bread first, and then make the sandwich. Oh, yeah. Here, let's start again. Okay, here we go. And... Here you go. Mm-hmm. Now turn it on. There we go. - Oh, right. - Mm-hmm. Mr. McKay didn't have a kitchen? We had a kitchen, obviously. Just, I never went in there. It was in a different part of the house. Ben always cooked for me. Mr. McKay. So you never left the basement at all? You weren't allowed in other parts of the house? We didn't call it a basement. It was where we lived. I'm sorry. That's okay. It's an honest mistake. What is? Calling it a basement. No, I meant, about everything. I'm... I'm sorry about everything. It's okay. You're trying. Thank you for doing this with me. It's supposed to be therapeutic, meditative. You used to love beads. Your Aunt Jill had a bead shop before she moved to Santa Fe, and you loved to go in there and sink your hands deep into the bins of glass beads. I wanted to get you some, but I was always afraid you'd eat them when I wasn't looking. What are you making? A string of beads. So I have room for about six more, but I have ten beads left. Which... which ones do you think I should leave out? Any of them. Well, help me out. Which ones do you think? I know things. Oh, I know. I wasn't nothing to him. He raised me. Okay. Also, "ones" isn't a word. What is that? What? That. Oh, that, wow. Maybe you better open it. Okay. What is it? Look through it. Look at the light. Whoa. Yeah. That's the window I promised you. Click that button down on the side. And those are the natural wonders of the world, before they went away. Where did they go? You know. I told you. Everything's ruined out there. Nothing good out there anymore. You couldn't save it? Well, you have to pick your battles. You can only save so much. I picked you. Those trees are so big. They're called redwoods. An up-and-down river? Oh, that's Niagara Falls. Inside-out mountains? That's... that's the Grand Canyon. It's so pretty. I love it. I love my window. Well, we have a lot to look at. We have underwater oceans, and night sky and space, the deserts of Africa, cities of Europe. It's like magic. Can we look at space? When you look at space, you have to lie on your back and look up at the stars. Leia? This is Ursa Major, the Great Bear... Leia. You seem distracted. Sorry. What are you thinking about? Did you ever see Niagara Falls? Um, once, when I was very small. Was it very far away? It's an eight, or nine-hour drive. What about the Grand Canyon? Was that far? It's in Arizona. Yes. It is in Arizona. Yes. This is a very special birthday for us, for all of us. And we wanted to give you something really special. We're very proud of you, Leia. Okay. Now... Open your eyes. What... It won't hurt you. It's okay, it's okay. No, no, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Feel her, feel how soft she is. - I don't want it. - She's harmless. Here, touch her, touch her. I don't want it. - Leia. - I don't want it. - Marcy. - Leia. We're sorry. I'll go bring back the dog. No, don't do that. Don't act like you're righting some wrong of mine. I will take the dog back myself. It was my idea. This doesn't make sense. It makes perfect sense. People have been doing trust falls for generations. But I don't understand why we're practicing something that isn't going to happen in real life. So, this isn't a practice for a real fall. This is the actual fall. It's a metaphor, for... things that happen in real life. Now, turn back around. Come on, here we go. Now... fall. So it's natural that you hesitate, because you've never trusted anybody before. I haven't? No. I'm here. I'm gonna catch you. Now fall. Okay, um... Maybe... would it help if I went first? If I let myself fall backwards and you caught me? Let's try that. Okay. I'm gonna fall backwards, and you're gonna catch me. One, two, three. How is she? She's fine. I drew her a bath. It'll get better. It is getting better. You're always looking ahead of everything. "She'll be fine. " "We'll get through it. " "Let's wait till morning. " "Let's see what the police say. " "Let's have another baby. " What about now? What about what's happening right now? I need you with me in this. I am. Well, it doesn't feel like it. If you can't see that I'm in this with you, that I... I want us to move on, yes. But I've also spent the last 20 years holding your hand through the search initiatives and the anniversary vigils and you never going back to work. That's not fair. Nothing's fair. You have to move on, especially now, now that it's over. - It's not over. - Because of you. You stopped. Everything stopped. Why is it that when you talk about it, it's always like something that only happened to me, like you're some noble outsider, some... some saint, who sacrificed his life for me. I have sacrificed my life. No. It was taken. Our life was taken, and you are not giving me anything, or her. Why won't you read one of these books? Why won't you show an even minor interest in how hard this is? It doesn't have to be that hard. How would you even begin to know how hard it is if you won't let yourself be a part of it? In case you haven't noticed, we need your help, whether you think we do or not. I didn't know anyone was in here. No one said if I could get out. Let me get you a towel. We want to talk to you about your future. My future? We know that you're smart and that you know things. And we think that maybe the best way to assess what you already know and structure your future learning might be a tutor. What's a tutor? A teacher. A teacher who comes to the house and works with you to make sure you have everything you need. Leia. - Leia. - Go away. Leia. - Go away! - Hey. Hey, that's not fair. Where have you been? I'm sorry. That's what's not fair. - Where have you been? - I'm sorry! Three days! You left me for three days! Two and a half days. Why would you do that? Why? I'm sorry. - I called your name. - I know. You get everything! - All right, all right. - I hate you! Get it all out. All right, all right, hey, hey, hey. Care! Why don't you care that I hate you? Because you don't hate me. Yes, I do! You want me to die like an animal! Aah! Stop it! Stop it now! Now, look at me! Look! Leia. Now we are even, yes? But I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't mean to stay away so long. You did mean to hit me. You aimed. You got me, on purpose. Okay. Okay? And I didn't mean to hurt you. I don't believe you. If you don't believe me, then... then what? Then what have you got? Nothing. That's the point. I don't have anything. Don't... don't say that. Look, everything I do is for you. If you don't have anything, then what am I? I'm... I'm a failure? Come on. Shh. Come on, shh. What's gonna happen to me, Ben? What's gonna happen to me after this? There... There is no "after this. " Anyway, think about it. We've got three weeks till the first session. Leia? Okay. Brennan, Pennsylvania. Packerton County Jail. Leia. You came. I miss you. You look different. You look good. I like your hair. Looks nice like that. Did you know... Did you know that you were changing things about me? Like my name... and birthday? I didn't know those things about you to begin with, so I didn't think I was changing anything. I was giving you things. You can't change what you don't know. I don't know how to do anything. You got here, didn't you? You could follow directions. You caught the bus. I don't know how to do anything. You'll be fine. Do you regret it? Never regret the things you do. Regret the things you don't. It takes as much effort running in place as running a mile. I'd rather see the mile. Even if you die in here? Even if I die in here. I can't decide what the worst thing that's ever happened to me is... Being with you my whole life or being without you for the rest of it. Hey. No girls in their 20s at all? What about teenagers? Any teenagers? Yes, I will hold. No, I know. Yes, you will... you will call me if you hear anything. Okay. Oh, my God, where were you? Are you okay? Where were you? Leia, where were you? I went for a walk. A walk? For seven hours? Yes. Where did you walk? I don't know, a park. What park? Grayson Park? Yes. With the fountain? Yes. There is no fountain in Grayson Park. Then the park with the fountain. There is no park with a fountain. You can trust me. And you can tell me where you were. I did. I don't think you did. What is this? Stop it! Hey, Leia. We were worried about you. Are you okay? Nothing is okay. Look at this. - They're pictures of him. - No. These are pictures of him, Glen. Stop, they're mine. I found them under her bed. "Today is my fake real birthday. I wanted to tell you I'm sorry... " - Come on. - "For blowing out the candles. "Even though without me telling you, "you wouldn't even know, "but I feel so bad about it, I have to tell you, "so I can apologize. "I'm sorry, and I'm sorry for telling you. " What kind of a hold does this man have over you? Okay, okay, Marcy. That's enough. You've had enough, Glen? Can we talk about this? We will sit down... I don't think we can talk about this. I... I don't think so. Put the phone down. Hello, this is Marcy Dargon. I'm calling for Detective Timms. - It's an emergency. - Marcy, wait. What are you doing? Wait. Well, please tell him this is Marcy... - Stop! - It's an emergency. It's an emergency! Stop getting him into trouble! - Give me those! - These are not yours. - They're mine! - These are not yours! - Give them back! - No! He is hurting you! He is still hurting you! - No! - He's hurting you right... You are hurting me! You! You did this to me! Go upstairs. Go! Thank you for all your help. What's wrong with you? I am done. You can't just give up on her. With you. I am done with you. Oh, you're done with me? I am so sick of dragging you around on my... Is that what you think? Yes. Do you have any idea what this has been like for me, huh? What you have been like for me? What you have been all these years? Where you have been? Where have you been all these years and years? Here. In our actual life, in what actually happened to us, in what actually is still happening to us. And it is not my fault that you cannot do that, and it is not my responsibility to make you. I want to move on, for Christ's sake. I want us all to move on. No. You want us to be different. You want to fast-forward to the easy part. Well, there isn't one, not like this. And I cannot drag Leanne back into reality if I have to do the same for you. And I choose her. The only loophole in our system is free will, and we can't account for that. A restraining order has since been put in place forbidding Mr. McKay to make further contact with the girl. His lawyer released this statement. "I deeply regret any conflict I may have caused. "I only want what is best for Leanne "and apologize for any actions "that could have been interpreted to the contrary. I wish her only good things at this difficult time. " Hello? Hello? Who is it? It's Mr. Henry. Mr. Henry? The tutor, for your daughter. I left you a message last week. I confirmed with your husband yesterday. Can I see some ID? - ID? - Yeah. Sure. Illinois? Yeah, that's where I'm from. No, thank you. Excuse me? Excuse me? Years ago when she became separated from a group of neighborhood kids while playing in an inflatable castle. 911, what is your emergency? Yes, my daughter is gone. She's missing, she's 41/2. Oh, my God, oh, my God. She was... she was in the bouncy castle with the other kids. Ma'am, ma'am, I'm gonna need you to calm down. What is your location? We're at Welling Park. There's a barbecue. I took off her shoes and I put her in the castle for a minute. I was here the whole time. I've been here. She can't go anywhere without her shoes. She doesn't know how to run without shoes. And how long has she been missing? Oh, my God, I don't know! How could I not know? Ma'am, how long ago did you discover she was gone? 15 minutes, we've been looking for her for 15 minutes. Can you tell me what she's wearing? She's wearing a yellow t-shirt and a denim jumper, yellow socks. She's not wearing any shoes. I'm holding her shoes. Benjamin McKay was a product of the foster care system... Bouncing between over 30 residences and group homes before the age of... Hello? Oh, hi, Dr. Andrews. How are you? I was gonna call you, and you beat me to it. Yeah, so... one of the things that I was gonna call you about is that Leanne has come down with a little touch of the flu, we think. So can I call you when she's feeling a little better? Thank you. Okay. Bye. Leanne? Leanne, it's time for lunch. I made you a sandwich, toasted like you like it. I'm gonna slide it under the door now. Am I still in trouble? You're not in trouble. Then can I come downstairs? Do you miss me? I'm thirsty. Water's in a half an hour. Check the schedule. What do I have to do? Just look at me. I don't get it. The bond that we created when you were an infant has been erased. Children bond to their mothers in the earliest months of life, when they can't speak, when they can only look in each other's eyes and trust that the mother will care for them and provide the things that they want or need, without their even asking. I'm 22. I'm not an infant. And that's why it's called "attachment therapy" instead of just "attachment. " Just attachment happens when you're a baby, but attachment therapy happens when you're older but you're incapable of attaching to someone. I was attached to someone. This isn't something I'm asking you to do. So... you should lie down here with your head in my lap. Okay. Now you look at me. For how long? We'll see. What color are my eyes? Blue. - Yours too. - Mm-hmm. They were green when I was born. They changed. When I was born, did my eyes change? I don't know. Well, are there pictures? Now, you know there aren't. I want you to tell me the story about when you found me. You mean when you found me? Please. Well, it was spring. And it was the middle of the beginning of the end. Of the world. Of the world. And... I was driving, and something told me to stop, something in here. So I did. And there you were. What did I look like? Whew, all lit up, the brightest... You were the brightest thing I ever saw. But you were stranded, and strangers. Am I still the brightest thing you ever saw? You're brighter than the sun at the center of the earth. Is there really a sun at the center of the earth? Well, there's a you, isn't there? Okay, keep going. Well, you could feel I was looking at you. - In here? - Mm-hmm. So I picked you up, and you said... "Save me. " So I did. I saved you from everybody you left behind, from ever being anything but mine. I wish I could remember things. What color were my eyes when I was born? Shh. You're not supposed to talk. They were gray. When am I allowed to be alone again? It's on the schedule. Now fall. Where's Glen? Did you make a schedule for him too? No, we made a choice. And at some point, we'll make a decision. Why choose to be apart after so long? It's important to make choices, even hard ones. Now fall. I don't want to. Leanne, fall. I choose not to. You have to. On the count of three... - No. - One, two... Aah! Now you don't get cake. I know you're scared. But it doesn't matter. I didn't catch you. That doesn't matter either. If you do this now, you can eat alone tonight. Glen? Marcy, open the door. I didn't think you were home. It's dark in there. You should turn a light on. I thought maybe you were out. No, here. I just came by for some things, some clothes. Open up the door, Marcy. Can I at least see her, say hi? You can't have it both ways. She'll call you when she's ready. I'm sorry. I'm just... sorry. I'll go get your things. At some point I'm coming back in the house. That's my life in there too, my house. I'd rather not do this with a lawyer, Marcy. And I wish you'd cared half as much about us as you care about your things, but... That's not fair. Nothing's fair. Sooner or later, Marce. Fine. Later. If you need anything, I'm not far. Over on Highland? - Yes. - Hmm. Lucky her. After all this time. Thank you. No, no. Good. I'm done. Mrs. Dargon? Dr. Andrews. I'm... I'm sorry. Oh, not at all. Is everything okay? Did you need something? May I come in? Of course, please. So how is Leia? She's... she's good. Oh, good. She hasn't been to my office in a while now. Well, she has that cold still. It's bronchitis, I guess, now. She'll be fine. A lot of bed rest. Her flu? What? Her flu turned into bronchitis? Yes, it did. Sorry. You okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm good, I'm good. - Thank you. - Here you go. What happened to your face? I fell. It's minor. It's not a big deal at all, really. Glen called my office. He's worried about you and Leia. Could we not call her that? I named her Leanne. That is her name. Sure. Glen expressed concern for both you and Leanne. He and I are taking some time apart, as I'm sure he told you. That must be very difficult at a time like this. Is this your first separation? I went to my sister's once, years ago. 12, 14 years ago. It was after they found that body in Maryland. How is Leanne finding the separation? Fine. Are they seeing much of each other? Not at the moment. He's... He's not... I don't really want to talk about Glen. Okay. What about other family? Your sister, are you still close? She got married. She had two kids, 11 and... 8, which made it hard to... travel. I imagine that's not easy, other people's children. You have kids, Dr. Andrews? No. I never know how to answer that. I'm sure you're doing just fine. You do this a lot, counsel victims of kidnapping? Not specifically. Me neither. But I'm sure you're doing just fine. Well, I don't want to take up any more of your time. If I could just see Leanne now, I'll be on my way. Oh, yes, right. Not for long, just to touch base. I'd love to hear about your vacation. I'm sure it was great for her. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four Mississippi, five Mississippi, six Mississippi... 58 Mississippi, 59 Mississippi... So she's... she's sleeping. I... I... I tried to wake her, but she's just too feverish to come down. Of course, her bronchitis. Yes, it'll have to be another time. Thursday, her regular time. Yes, right, Thursday. Great. Bermuda. Bermuda. Barracuda's a fish. Okay. What was your favorite part? We went on a boat. Good. I've never been on a boat. I know. What if she asks why I like it? You just tell her you like the water. But what if I don't like the water? Do you? I don't know. I don't want to answer these questions. I don't want you to answer them either. How was the plane ride? It was scary. Good. I don't get it. Why would people do something scary on purpose? It's not actually scary. It's just, some people think that it's scary. Do you? Not really. Then why do I? Because you've never been on a plane before. But the boat wasn't scary. No. - Why not? - I don't know. I'm sorry. Why don't you have a tan? I wore a sun screen. One word, "sunscreen. " I wore a sunscreen. Not "a," just "sunscreen. " "I wore sunscreen. " It's... it's a lotion. I wore sunscreen. That's good. I... I... I think that's good for today. I think we should... we'll practice more tomorrow, yeah? Okay. What happens if I get them wrong? I'm just trying to do my best to protect you. From what? Why do you ask so many questions and you still don't know what a barracuda is? I know what it is now. It's a fish. Let's move on. What's next? Beads. I think that we're gonna try something new. Applied accountability. What's applied accountability? I fall, you fall. I succeed, you succeed. So, how are you feeling about the changes in the house? Which changes? Glen being gone. Okay, I guess. Are there other changes? Has your relationship with Marcy changed at all since he's been gone? Can we talk about something else? What about your vacation? Good. It was good. Good. I used a sunscreen. It's a lotion. What about your relationship with Mr. McKay? We're not allowed to have a relationship. And do you still want one? That doesn't have to be a yes-or-no question. It's natural to feel conflicted about Mr. McKay. Ben. Ben. You always say that. What? That it's natural to feel conflicted about my feelings. And it is. But how can you have feelings about something when you don't know anything about it? Is that how you feel about him? That's how I feel about everything. Okay, all right. I'll let you get settled in. Water's in a half an hour. Is this how people love? They become a room for you to live in, and then they lock? How many rooms do you get in your life? Am I lucky or unlucky? I'm really asking. We're both lucky. I... I have something for you. I have to go and get it. Where is it? It's downstairs. We are downstairs. It's in the basement. Is it alive? No. Okay. I'm gonna trust you. Okay, good. 17 years, the singular window in the basement was sealed and covered, making it impossible to see in or out. Neighbors said they never noticed anything unusual about Benjamin McKay or his basement. He kept to himself mostly. We'd always say hello if we happened into each other, but, you know, I mean, never mentioned family, never had anyone over. I mean, he was always alone. At least we thought he was alone. No one knows how much time McKay himself spent in the basement, though there was just one bed fashioned out of a camping cot wrapped in blankets. The bedding is being tested for DNA, and thus far the results of those tests have not been released. What will happen at this museum of captivity at 111 Langston Road is yet to be determined, as the relics of a life underground wait to be claimed. Truly horrifying. For 21 News, I'm Juan Fernandez. This is a stationary bicycle. You ride it in place, like... like this. See? And... it stays up by itself, so you don't have to wear a helmet or anything, and you can change the speeds with these dials. I... I found it downstairs. Here, get on. Now you just... you pedal. You push down with your feet. Yes, like that. Next week is a solitary block, and I thought it would be nice for you to have something to do. Dear Marcy, thank you for caring about me, for trying. The idea that you can fight for something you want is new to me. I thought before that you only fought against things you didn't. But now I know there are different ways of doing it. It's not that I don't not love you specifically. I maybe don't love anyone, maybe. Or maybe that doesn't matter. I'd say I wish I could be different, but I don't. I don't know what that would be. I'm sorry I don't remember you from before, but I'll remember you now. I didn't leave because you were bad. The whole point of taking everything away from me in the first place was that I would get to be someone. I mean, I am someone, when I'm alone. But when I'm with other people, I am what they think I am. I don't know how to be that. And I think I don't want to be something to share anymore. I thought you couldn't choose your family and that you were trying to make me choose you. But then I saw that Ben chose me. He picked me out, and he made me his. And there is no one choosing that. There is no un-growing up. It's time for me to grow up for good... and have something that's mine. And mine only. Sincerely, Leia.
