Go right ahead, but the government is strong and I assure you this ship will not sink. It will not sink! He told them this time. He just doesn't get it. I'd say you don't. Excuse me. Please, excuse me! Great job! Thanks to you all! See you on Monday, don't forget. Well done, great speech! Cut the compliments, Malgradi, and make our friends at the Treasury reason. Since you're on the committee, talk to them yourself, you cannot simply sit there and second. I'm bending over backwards on that committee, but by now... If we'd dumped them, the government wouldn't be about to fall. Enough talk, take action! How's it going with the amendment on the waterfront of Ostia to put into the Suburban Renewal Law? About halfway, seeing who's behind it... They're the good ones, here they are! Keep up the good work, well done! - What happened? - We'll leave the Party. Who'd ever thought it of you, so straight and upright! - You're one to preach! - Well done, well done! - Have you read it? - What? The various European statements on us. Fuck! Ah, you speak Italian! Ninni! Going great, isn't it? Take a break, that knock-out body might rack-up victims. By the way, someone's asking for you, what do I do? It could be good, he's organizing a conference next year here in Rome, I could do it myself, if you put in a good word. I'm already busy tonight. - With him, like always? - Yes. I gotta find him a different girl every night. He's obsessed. Thanks to you all, good night. - Sir, good evening! - Good evening. Ms. Lagarde said Italy lacks credibility in the announced measures, isn't that a rejection? No one's rejecting anyone, let's be serious. The opposition says Italy is on the brink of default. I think it's wrong to think Italy is in a severe financial crisis, consumer spending hasn't decreased at all and our lifestyle is that of an affluent country. We're not on the brink of any abyss. - Thank you. - Keep up the good work. Goodnight, Your Holiness. Darling, the committee will go on late, don't wait up. Yes, I'm a little tired, but don't worry, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You can drop me here. - Good evening, Mr. Malgradi. - Hi Faisal, any news on your son? - Not yet. - I'm sorry. For your trouble... Thank you. Have a good night. Shut up, you're upsetting my girlfriend. Listen... How about this signature? We gotta go, Aureliano! You're wasting my time just for a signature! Give me that, Mirco. What are you doing? - How about this signature? - Yes! - Don't cry! Yes or no? - Yes, I'll sign! I'll sign, I'll sign! Good man. See? That didn't take much. Don't do it. No! C'mon! C'mon, c'mon! Let's go! Why all these people? The first nightclub rounds are done, now they're going again. - Move, think we're on vacation? - C'mon, let's move! - Evenin', Scab. - I said don't call me that. So? What are we doing here? Tell Samurai even the guy at Traiano says he'll sell. My work's almost done, you gotta have me meet him. - You can tell me. - You? Who the fuck are you? If my dad hadn't got you votes, you'd still be robbin' old ladies. Your father reasoned with people. - I'm not my father. - I know. In fact, you've got more balls than brains. Tell Samurai I got more contracts in two months than Dad in two years. Okay? Bye, Scab! Roach? He's inside. This town's all changed, the traffic, the buildings... Even this place, what is it? What was here before? Nothing. And you? Have you changed too? Or are you the same Samurai you were? The warrior at the service of the Idea? I carry the Idea right here now, and that's it. Twenty years... I did 20 years for heists and neo-fascist terrorism, but now Pippo's a big shot, you've become the king of Rome... And me? Nothing. What would you like? A little piece of your trafficking with Africa. I'll handle the diamonds from down there for you. And if I say no? - You can't. - Why not? Because this time I won't keep quiet. What's your hand? Don't worry, my cards are good. Nothing's in your house, we cleaned it out when they arrested you. That's what lawyers are for. You're bluffing. And you're not good at it. If I'm bluffing, show your hand. Your lawyer is on my payroll, been on it for years. Ilena! What's the matter? Fuck, she's really sick. - And she's a minor. - It's what you asked me for. I know! Help me, shit. What do you want me to do? You're the big shot, call someone! I can't call anyone. That colonel friend of yours? And what do I tell him? Let's take her out, have you got the car? - No, I sent the driver away. - Call him back. Shut up! Don't talk shit, shut up! I have to go, I can't stay here, you can understand that. You can't leave. Cover her, will you please? Cover her? Shit! So? I'll call a friend of mine. Good, do that. I'm off on the usual rounds. Send the kids to bed, it's like Christmas here. Okay, get to bed! Eminence... What's the matter? Does he feel ill? No, it's not that, it's... more, it's something I should probably keep to myself, because the Holy Father confided in me like a son, but the burden is too heavy. What did he tell you? The Pope wants to step down. That can't be! Did he say when he intends to do this? Very soon. Aren't you ever sick of this place? Why don't you sell it? No way! You know what's about to happen here? Ostia will be like Las Vegas. You'll see how much it'll be worth! Why do you like it so much? Because it's all mine. Don't you like it? You don't? And what do you like? You. And this? Do you like this? Yeah, that too. That too? Don't you love it most of all? No, not most of all. What's better? Watching you sleep. Okay, so... I'm leaving. Don't contact me, I'll call you. - Need any help? - No, Faisal, she drank too much. - Should I call a taxi? - I'm the taxi, bye! You look tired. Yeah, Dad, I'm exhausted, I just got off work. What did you want? Nothing in particular. You called me three times tonight. That's because yesterday I went to the cemetery. Couldn't you go too, once in a while? Your mother's grave was full of dead flowers. If she were alive, she'd like that. I'd like her to be alive too. Listen, I'm dead tired, I need to get to bed. Why don't I come by the construction site tomorrow? Actually, tomorrow's a mess, but the day after... Friday? It was a mistake having you come here. Dad... - Need a lift? - Bye, Seba. I'll pay! How much? Thank you. Stop! He jumped! Call someone! Call an ambulance, hurry! Mr. Malgradi won't be here for an hour, if you like... All right, I'll wait. Got any coffee around here? Add a drop of cold milk and make me happy! Someone wants to talk to you. We heard of your loss, condolences. Thank you. You must come with us now. - Where? - To Manfredi. So he can explain everything. What? Why your father decided to fuck off. How dare you speak to me like that? Do I know you? Calm down. - Don't you know who Manfredi is? - No, no idea. Your father knew him well, they were in business. He's my uncle, we have the same last name, Anacleti. Excuse me, let's talk about this some other time, tomorrow... No, not tomorrow, today, believe me, it's better. That person wants to talk to you, I wasn't able to send him away. How are you, Mr. Malgradi? Everything okay? Excuse me, who are you? We saw each other last night. Wanna talk about it in front of everyone? No. Come with me. From now on, you and your playmates get your coke from me and your hookers too, you gotta get them from me too. And, seein' you got dealings all over, let me cash-in on something. What dealings? Cash-in... what? I'm not a businessman, I'm a politician. Exactly, what the fuck do you think I'm saying? Politicians eat and you gotta let me eat too or I'll go to the cops and tell them everything. I understand. How much? I'll find a way to get it to you. You don't see, I want you to get me in with the right people, you decide. Relax, I'll give you time. I know you're worried, killing a minor with overdose doesn't happen every day. I didn't kill anyone. You have one day, I'll be back tomorrow. Hello. Do you know why your father killed himself? No, I don't. Debts. A mountain of debts, with us. Things weren't going well for him lately. I know he had a tough period two years ago. That continued and we took on all his debts, we're talking millions. So, everything he had is ours. He passed on early and we want our investment back. My friend, when the fat runs out, you get what you can, even the nerves, right down to the bone. Get my drift? Too bad nothing's in my name, or I could have... We're off to a bad start. How about the villa where you organize parties? No, it's in the company name, all I have is stock. The majority of share, so, it's yours. Not exactly... I'll give you a week to hand over the villa, the house, car and all the small change you can scrape up. I'm furious with your father, so, if you don't go, I'll chop your leg off, put it in the fridge and give it back when you bring me the money. Scabbre... I need a hand, you have to help me. - You asking me? - Yes, only you. I had a visit from a guy, who needs to be taught certain things can't be done. Who is it? A scab. I'm listening. Hi, Dagger. Hi, you scared me. The devil himself can't scare you! Wait a minute. The politician complained. The fuck you're doing going to his office in front of everyone? - It's none of your fucking business. - It's not done. We treat those people different. What do you want? Are you his butler? Why didn't he come directly to me? Same reason your brother didn't go and sent you. Manfredi doesn't even know I saw him, this is my own deal. Politics aren't your thing, forget it. And who's thing is it, yours? Sorry but you gotta make room for me, I'm sittin' at this table too. Why do you touch your dick when you talk? Got the clap? - Maybe you do. - Don't fuck me around. Who knows, maybe so. Manfredi's right, when he says the Atlantic separates you and your pa. Your brother doesn't even know where the Atlantic is, Dagger. So, I'll tell him you'll be by to give him a geography test. - Good! - Now get the fuck lost! Manfredi! Manfredi! He died next to the locked door of his car, a brand new luxury SUV. Maybe he wanted to run and was attacked from behind. Alberto Anacleti is local, young, he grew up here. A figure known to police by his nickname, Dagger. We're on the south east side of Rome, home to many strip clubs. Forensics is at work where it happened last night. The victim is a young man, about 25, it appears he was stabbed and for the moment, the men are working, but the weapon still hasn't been found. Hi, Pippo. ACCIDENT OR EXECUTION? Did you read about Roach? Did you do it? It was Rome, it's dangerous even to cross the street in this fucking city. Over time I've learned to take it easy with the dead, they're tough to handle. But it seems you don't know that. What are you talking about? What the fuck were you thinking calling Aureliano Adami to resolve a matter involving the Anacleti family? Manfredi Anacleti is one of the most badass fucks in Rome. I didn't call anyone, I don't know this Aureliano Adami. - He's called "Number 8". - I said I don't know him! I just wanted to scare the idiot who was blackmailing me, I spoke to a party colleague who has contacts... Why didn't you call me? I haven't seen or heard from you in years. How the fuck did I know the asshole would kill him? How did you find out? I know lots of things. So, why are you here? To give you a hand, if anyone rubs you wrong, I'll cover you. In exchange I need the Suburban Renewal Law. It's on its way. With the amendment for the Ostia beaches? - No, that still... - Vote it with the amendment. - You're on the committee, right? - Yes, but I can't... Once again, vote it. In a few days, your party, the government... will fall apart. Rumors, gossip, anyway I'll ask my party leaders... Your leaders no longer exist. If the law passes before the government falls, meaning days, Santa Claus will bring your foundation a couple of million. Just push the law in the Chamber, get back the defector votes... Cuts are in the air, how can I? If it's money you need, no problem, we can buy anyone. Just do your part, I'll deal with the rest. Got it? Yes. Say: "Okay!" Okay. Who was the girl that night? Who do you think she is? A hooker. Where does she live? No, wait... She's the only witness. No! She won't talk, won't say a thing. This is absurd! Couldn't we meet in a more discreet place? - I feel safer here. - What's that mean? - I'm scared of you. - Of me? You ordered Dagger killed? How can you even think that? I know loads of things about you. I've got everything: photos, videos... I filmed you when you slept, when you did drugs. If anything happens to me, I'll ruin you. You can't touch me! I didn't ask anyone to kill Dagger, it was the mistake of an asshole from Ostia called "Number 8", what you don't understand is that someone much worse might come after you. From now on, don't talk about me and I won't talk about you, it's convenient for both of us. You have to go now. Don't go back home. Hear me? Don't go home. - Seba... - Ninni! You have to help me, I'm in trouble. No, please, you don't know the mess I'm in. - I know. - Really, please... Please, I can't go home, I'm scared. Can I stay with you? Just for tonight! That old guy is the great Samurai? And he goes around alone? He was the only one in the Magliana gang my dad was scared of. Why? He knows loads of things, all the Mafias respect him. You and your family are in this deal only because it's here in Ostia, on your turf. You worry me, you want to be the boss, but still haven't learned how. I don't like the way you talk. I respect you, but I want to be respected too. Because you respect me, you killed a guy you should have just scared? He wanted in on the deal, he told me! Don't bullshit me, Aureliano! The Anacletis don't know a fucking thing about all this. What's all the fuss? I took a dickhead off the streets! No backtalk, just do what I say, you have to do like your father did. My father licked all the asses of the Families of the South, I won't do it. The "Families of the South" poured millions into this deal and I'm their guarantor, I want to work in peace. Is this big deal really coming? We do lots of talkin'! It's happening, if we cut the shit. Can you be good for a couple of weeks? Answer me. - I can, I can. - I hope so, for your sake. I wanna know who he saw last night. Look for 'em one by one. Find them. So, it was the brother of... This guy that died was Manfredi's brother. Manfredi, the... The Anacletis, the gypsies! Now this guy's after me. Who, the guy from Ostia? No, why? Maybe they're two different things, maybe it was a thing between gangs. Maybe you have nothing to do with this, these guys here... I have to leave now, I have an appointment. It'll all work out, you'll see. Stay as long as you like. Bye, Ninni! Bye. Is Manfredi here? Manfredi's here? I want to talk to Manfredi. Not today, come back tomorrow. It's really important. What? I know who killed Dagger. Let him in. So? How do you know who did it? A rumor. I know all of Rome. Give me a name. But... the villa where I work... you have to let me keep it, take the rest. I want that name right now, or I'll throw you in the cage with him. It's a guy from Ostia, he's got a nickname... What nickname? Number 8. You know him? Do you know why? From kitten to tiger, thanks to all the beatings, he nearly ripped my nephew's arm off the other day. So, you'll have him put down. No, I respect all warriors, as long as they show me they've got courage. Now get out. So, the villa... I told you to get out, my brother's dead, not my cat! - Sorry. - We mourn alone. Ninni! It's me! I've been waiting so long. You never came back, where were you? Public relations. I'm cold. Poor thing. I'll warm you up. May I? I'm going home tomorrow. Why? You can stay as long as you like, at least until they kick me out. Who'll kick you out? No, I just meant it... as a joke. I feel good here with you. You do? Can I say something stupid? I do it all the time! If I'd had a brother like you, I wouldn't be a hooker. No? Why, what else can you do? - I can do lots of things. - Like? I can play hopscotch, jump rope... Anything a little more... modern? I kick butt at videogames. Okay, that's good. Want to fuck? Thanks for the thought. I can just see this shit town all changed. All the lights, cars coming and going, neon signs, fireworks, one big party, day and night. All the skyscrapers, game rooms, slot machines, casinos... And a mile-long row of restaurants, clubs, people having fun, top-notch pussy. All rich, all beautiful. Okay. See you next week. What are you doing? They're coming. We'll have to buy this guy something or we'll look bad. Stay down! Go! Cover your face, there's cameras. Wait. It's just a scratch. Let's go. My love, don't die on me here! My love! You can't leave me, please! Get up! Let's go. C'mon, the cops are comin'. I'm here with you. What do we do? Mirco! Go! He can't walk, Mirco! He can't walk! Go! I'm not asking you to change your mind, just support me on the Suburban Renewal Law. Politics has nothing to do with it, it's about Ostia. It's a big project, if you say yes, you'll be part of it. Meaning? The firm handling the funds for the waterfront, will need a General Manager, interested? What exactly would I do? What do you need? Your vote. I already have your friends', a few more here and there... If you say yes, I feel more at ease. It's a zoning issue, if they break your balls, tell them the agreement was before you left the Party. A CEO's salary? - 500,000 a year. - Plus benefits. Obviously. - Car with driver, trains, flights... - Of course. Length of contract? Four years, renewable. Alright. Just a few days left to get the law passed, so we need to free those funds, now. That's impossible, it takes time to make such large sums available... Just a few days or it all blows up. I'm sorry, I really don't know how it can be done, it's impossible. Unfortunately, at this very moment, there's something bigger than me, or you, but don't make me say it. Eminence, you are too intelligent not to imagine the consequences of your attitude. If the deal blows, they'll put you at the bottom of the Tiber. And I'd rather see a better fate for you. Alright, but, with increased risk, the expected quota will have to increase too. That's no problem at all. Any better? I didn't sleep all night, this shit wound stings. You gotta change location, I got a fishing shack set up for you, it sucks, but it's really hidden. I'm not moving, I'd like to see if they come. They all know you're here, it's not safe. Cover her, please. When should I go? Today, then we fuck the Anacletis up the ass. They think we're freaked out, their guard's down, and we fuck 'em! We go after them tonight. Do what you have to, slaughter those shit gypsies! Instead, nobody does a thing, we do nothin'. Why? - I made a promise. - To who? To whoever the fuck I want. We can't let them get away with this. I make the decisions, no more fuckin' around or it all blows up. Tell everyone to sit tight. "I am this bread from Heaven", said the Lord, "If any man eats of this bread, he shall live forever". - The body of Christ. - Amen. I heard, before he died, Dagger was called by a piece of ass who's in the big time, one of those who cost. That night she was in trouble, so she called my brother. That's the shit people you hang with, right? Know her? Cat got your tongue? - What do you want with her? - Just a chat. Do you know her, or not? Where is she? Tell me what you want to know, I'll talk to her. Want me pissed off in church? Just tell me where she is, don't drag your feet. Tell me where I can find her. She's at my place, my apartment. Lord, grant him eternal rest, and let Your perpetual light shine upon them... O God, creator and redeemer of all the faithful, grant the souls of the deceased universal remission of sins. Seba! I just want to know the name of the guy who was with you. What do you care? He has nothing to do with Dagger's death. I say he called Number 8 to get rid of a witness. He didn't call Number 8. - How do you know? - I just do. Because I know him, he'd never even think about it. Give me his name, I'll do the rest. I... I guess you don't understand, let's do it this way. I ask a question and you answer or I'll cut your sweet face. - Who was it? - He's a politician named Malgradi. Malgradi? I'll tell you all about him, just don't hurt me. I can't stand just staying here, just the thought bores me. Get up, Viola. Go take a walk! Go out, I want to be alone! Take me to Rome, I gotta get a wax. - Pull over here. - Here? Hello. Miss? Excuse me, do you have an appointment? Stop, Miss, please. Fuck off! Can I help you? Ehi! Let's go. C'mon! Thanks for coming. You never age, I haven't seen you in ten years. Stop this mess between you and the Ostia guys. I didn't make any mess. To kill Number 8 you almost caused a massacre. Let me remind you he killed my brother and a few hours later they wiped out two kids I saw born. No one can stop my revenge. It's not the moment to have a fucking war between you. I'm on a project in the interest of the Families and I need peace and quiet. A project? What project? A project. It must be a big deal if you're in it, how come I don't know nothin'? Because it's in Ostia, it involves politics, finance. Till yesterday you were loan sharks for nobodies. Okay, but we've grown now and they all respect us. To your face, because you scare them, but from behind? They still call you shit gypsies. You're still a couple of Shylocks. I don't give a fuck about that bullshit, I just want to even up the corpses, I'm only sorry I didn't kill Number 8 like a dog. I've told you what I had to. Think twice before going against me and the Families. You shit! You're a piece of shit! You make me sick! I trusted you! Fuck you! In the parties you organize, full of pussy and dirty politicians, have you ever heard talk of this project? If you tell me who's behind it, I'll give you your villa back. Of course I've heard about it, it's a huge project, they want to make a kind of Las Vegas in Ostia: casinos... A group has been pushing for months, but approval is set for next year. It's for now, they did something to move up the project. That's something I don't know. To push it through, they need a politician, it might be this Malgradi. Aida! I'm working. Malgradi? Maybe. - Maybe? - Yeah. Get out, all of you, you've pissed me off! You're driving me nuts! Know what, I'm leaving! Let's go, come with me. Fuckin' bastards! You're just fuckin' bastards! Damned them! You fuck off too! You walking shitter! I'd like to call on this politician, know where he lives? Yes. - What do you mean by "call on"? - A courtesy call. Has he got a bodyguard? He has a driver, but no bodyguard, why? Let's go, move. This building, top floor. - Perfect. - He lives here. Let's go! - Give me time to walk away. - You're coming too. You talk better than me, you talk to him. All the times we crossed paths at parties? He'll recognize me! See? He won't recognize you now. Is this a joke? Don't piss me off! You can't go, you're in this like us. You gotta get dirty, so you don't go running to the cops. What's going on? Stop, you piece of shit! What do you want? Please don't hurt us! Shut up! Give them everything, please! Now listen to what this friend of mine says and answer him straight. Say you will. Say you will! - Yes. - Louder! - Yes. - Come here. C'mon! The bill for the construction of all those hotels, the casinos and the Olympic structures at the beaches of Ostia is going to pass now, right? We're talking about the "Waterfront", right? Is it true you're the one getting this law passed? - Is it you or not? - I'm in it too. - Mommy! - Sweetie, stay away, it's nothing! Shut up! Look at me! Do you know me? Get a good look! - Know me? Know who I am? - No, I don't. I'm the brother of the guy you had killed, Dagger's brother. - I didn't do... - Filthy rat! He's gone and you're still here breathing, so listen up good: you gotta block this fucking law and tell your bosses at the top we want a cut of 20%. 20%. Tell 'em that, do like I say. And just to be sure, lovely lady, we're takin' this little toy, and if you call the cops, the toy could get broken. It could get broken! You're sure you just put him to sleep? Don't worry, he's all yours now. Meaning? Keep an eye on him and tell me if there are problems. But... How do I figure into this? I can't do it! You're mine now, I'll do what the fuck I want with you. Now take me to your house, we'll hide the kid there. Pippo! I have to talk to him. - Good evening. - Get lost. - Who the fuck... - Get lost! Go, out! You guys too, out! What happened? Manfredi Anacleti came to my house and kidnapped my son, you said you'd protect me. You didn't do a fucking thing, so our deal is off! I'll bring him home, just relax. I won't 'just relax', I don't believe anything or anyone anymore, especially you, you can shove the law up your ass, shove it up your ass! Pippo, you don't have to do anything, just calm down and listen to me. Go home, go stay with your wife. What did he ask in exchange? He wants a cut of the deal, 20%. I'll fix this thing for you, nothing will happen to your son! Don't get any closer. C'mon! Don't complain, another guy would throw you off the bridge for the shit you pulled. What do you think? We're playing cops and robbers, havin' fun? Not one fucking bit! Any bullshit, the millions go and we get years in jail. - We can't always let it go. - What the fuck do you know? You made a mess! I evened the score for you, didn't I? Now it's World War 3 against the gypsies! It's my fault? Yeah, it's your fault. Careful! Careful! Go! On my three: one, two, pull! Careful! A grim chance discovery: the body of a woman was found this morning at the bottom of a man-made lake on the outskirts of Rome. Giving the alarm were the maintenance men charged with emptying the basin. Police are investigating, little news has leaked out, but it seems it's the body of a very young woman. At first examination the body may have been in the water for 3 or 4 days, but autopsy results are needed. The man-made pool of water is located in the outskirts to the south of the capital. It's hard to find eyewitnesses, the entire area is abandoned... I know, what we did was shit. So, how do we fix it? I made an agreement with Manfredi, he's in the project now and to pay for the deaths you caused, he'll take part of your cut. - No way, this isn't their turf! - I've already decided. That's just great, but I've been working my ass off for a year getting villas and lands sold. I'd say you can just go to Manfredi and say the deal's off. And the junkie... you gotta give her to me. Hands off Viola, she's my stuff. And don't call her that, it bothers me. So, no junkie and no deal with Manfredi? Exactly. Anyway, you know nothing moves in Ostia without my okay and that I'm not like my father, so I don't give a fuck who you are, who you were, what you represent, you're a total nobody to me. You were... But this is today! You were and I am. Move! Gettin' some sun? Have you all voted? Have you? May I close? Voting is closed. In favor 380, against 26. The Chamber approves. It passed! It passed. Hello? Hello? Hello. It passed, give me back the doll. Where... Hello? All okay, the kid's fine. My work's done, right? Tell me tomorrow, I gotta go now, my family is waiting. About that promise... I told you I'm goin' now. It's just a second, all I need are the keys. I'll decide when I have a second and now I don't. What's that mean? You've got one now! I'm asking you for what's mine! I did it all, everything! Raising your voice in my house? What's yours? I need the villa to work, understand? You owe me! Most I can do is offer you a job. I don't want it, I want what's mine! You don't have a fucking thing. How the fuck can you be this way? You piece of shit! You rat, you scum! Want to die? Want to die? Throw him out! - Well, satisfied? - In your opinion? I hope yours is the start of a political change of heart. Go slow, a step at a time. You sign the contract tomorrow, I got you what you asked for. You won't be sorry for the choice you made. Congratulations! I didn't think you could pull it off. You're not the only one. Now can we stop warring in the Party? From tomorrow we work side by side, even in your nice foundation. I await you with open arms! Let's have something to eat. How are you? Thanks for coming, I'm glad to have you here. I'd rather not be here, I don't have good news. I just received a tip about you from the DA's office. The DA's office? They want to issue an arrest warrant to the presidential offices of Parliament. An arrest warrant? That's absurd. Well, it concerns a dead girl. I got mixed up in that by chance, I didn't even know the girl. I'm not the one to convince! They're investigating a night of drugs, and sex with a minor. Listen, you know what? As things stand, in this country, a guy like me, who's gotten where he is, and arrived where I've arrived, can tell the Judiciary to fuck off! I'm a Member of the Parliament of the Republic of Italy. They can shove it up their ass! - You know I'm always here for you. - Thank you. This is nothing personal. This is the Norwegian salmon that our friend orders. Fuck! - Everything okay? - Excuse me. At 8:30, after the Chamber's final approval of the Budget... Could you turn up the radio? The Prime Minister will present his resignation to President Napolitano. The Budget has received final approval, we await the resignation, then the Head of State will begin consultations. For the outgoing Prime Minister, many meetings, starting with one with his probable successor. Annamaria dear, this is Malgradi, would you put the Prim... Filippo Malgradi. Put the Prime Minister on, please? I have to speak to him before he leaves. Annamaria, if we go to elections, he's not risking alone, we all are. If we go to early elections, my seat has to be secure. Five minutes and I'll be... Damned fucking slut! A small crowd has gathered before Montecitorio and Palazzo Chigi.... Dirty crooks! What's all this? Piazza Colonna is closed off, people are standing, waiting, their eyes on the entrance to Palazzo Chigi. What's happening? Good evening, it's all closed-off. Look... - The Prime Minister's waiting for me. - Sorry, it's all blocked. Sorry, excuse me. Resign, resign... Excuse me, I must get through! Excuse me, sorry! Malgradi, you crook! Go home, at your age. Let me through, please! Excuse me! Don't shout, I can hear you! No need to yell, I can hear you! Go home! Excuse me, sorry. Will you let me through? The Prime Minister is waiting for me! Will you let me through? I must see the Prime Minister! Mr. Prime Minister! Mr. Prime Minister, we have to talk! They're attacking us! Mr. President, you mustn't resign! The Judiciary, Mr. Prime Minister! I have to be re-elected! It doesn't matter. Anyway, he got the law passed, didn't he? If there are new elections, we'll find a politician, maybe on the other side. Yeah. Are you leaving already? Yes. But I'll come by tomorrow. Mom, the cake? You didn't even taste it, I went all the way to the Kosher shop to get it. I don't like anything anymore. You're tellin' me! I have to make such an effort. It's raining so hard. - Wait a while. - I'm all covered up. - Want me to eat some? - Just a little. - How much? A lot or a little? - A little. Like this? - Are you glad? - Good girl. - Bye, Mom. - Bye. You're making a mistake. Move. I want to make a deal. A deal? - With me? - Yes, with you. Next time. For my father
