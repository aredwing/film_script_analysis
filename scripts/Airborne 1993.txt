It is war. Sometimes you have to fight to win, right? - No need to go that far. I do not know, but I think you do not need fight to achieve anything. Anything? I once knew a guy who always fought by the waves. When someone got close, I would go up like crazy and drove away. No matter the face size, the blockhead was not even there. One day I was behind a boy Morey-boogie, nervous to be in your wave. I thought: I will teach a lesson to this kid. I'll scare him. Then it went up but came so close that the board hit him in the head. I had blood everywhere. The boy began to drown ... - He was good? - Yes, but with a scar on his head. What happened to the surfer? I'm living in Cincinnati. You know, it's funny. You're so worried by the fighting wave that loses the chance to enjoy the sea. Life is too short for that. Since it is not fight, what do you like? - I like the smell of the sea. ... the color of the setting sun and surfing in the rain. - You are a poet. - No, I just know what I like. I think you like what's cool. We are talking and not even know your name. - Nikki. - I'm Mitchell Goosen. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too, Mitchell Goosen.

At least one burrito, my God. I need the ocean. I can not stand it anymore. - Calm down, man. Neither the E.T. want to go both home like me. I need to get out of here. - Can we go to the market and lead you want my mom cook. - Not exactly what I had in mind, Wiley. - Which was? You do not want to bring something different? Mom is very flexible with food. Mitchell? Louie, come quickly is Mitchell. Oh Jesus, Mary or Joseph, 190. Do not be ... do not overdose overdose. Aunt Irene ... Oh my love... Do not ever do this with Your Uncle Louie again. - I was just resting. - I think it was drugged. - No, I'm just tired. - You will pass out or something? - No, I just had a hard day. - Oh, I was already forgetting. We received a card from their parents. His father was intoxicated with the food. And it received a large package I laid on the bed. What is it? - Something that should never have forgotten. Nikki! Are you okay? How are you? I am fine. How are you? It was just a little upset, nothing much. You have to be more careful with this. Dangerous if not know how to use. I will be more careful hereafter.

It's my bus. I forgot it was going to the city with Wiley Friday night. Bring him too. I do not know if he can pack company in time. Can I bring a friend. Nice. Okay, well ... bye Mitchell Goosen.

Do you think Gloria will like the look of a guy rebel without a cause walking the margins of society? It's the way you dress everyday? All right, Mr. Esperto. Mr. Know It All. Help me with the laundry. Let's see what you have. You're not my cousin. Ah, what is? I quit. Popeye , Tai a great guy. Do you know why? He never entered the Club Hairy. Wrong. Because his motto was "I am what I am." You Think Popeye ever bothered with clothes to win Olive Oyl ? I say no, mate. And you know why? He was gay. Because it is what it is. Hello... ... Gloria, I am Wi ... Wiley ... ...How are you? Po ... I can drive. - How about a stroll the pier before dinner? - Sounds good to me. - That's it, since I have Driver's License. - That's cool, right? - Only he needed three attempts. - It happens. Here we go. Just checking commands. Whose was that car? If you could have lunch with only three people worldwide living, dead or fictitious. Does not matter. Who would? - What kind of question is that? - Just a joke, go. Well, I must say Tom Curtis , most live surfer, would be cool. And ... maybe Gandhi . But not for lunch because he does not eat anything. - And the third? - Would you. I? You can have lunch with anyone in the world and you choose me. - You are not anyone. You are special. So... Usually always come to the pier? Oh, yeah ... here I am a lovely atmosphere and ... personally ... - The best pier side is over there. You need to see that side ... - Hungry? - Dying. Staff? We can go for ... Gloria is hungry. Much. I think she liked me, man. Furthermore, she knows the words to You ate my train Jenny Young , man. It's great and she likes. I think that neither teachers They are so boring. All strange. - He's a little nervous. - He's nervous? I thought I would die when almost hit that gas truck. We almost turned asphalt. - It will change your view. - Not in this lifetime. ... it was very strange. Did not I say here would be cool? I love this place, it's my favorite. I practically live here. They wanted for a pull back there so you can sleep here. Funny because I never seen you here before. I have been always on Tuesdays. - Really? Sit in the back ... with the owner. I come late, very late. Hey guys, do not mind Walter and you sit down, do you? Blane, get the hell out of here. - See, it seems that Nikki arranged a new little friend. Partner, good, what're going on here is private. You understand, right? What do you think we left another time and bowling, perhaps? I like bowling but do not want go, Blane. We have to go? - Go? Before thanking our star for helping to win the game? It would be impolite. I understand what you mean, brah. Thanks for the words and Goodbye. - Boys, do something. - Why do not they leave us alone? What do you think we left here? - Good idea. - At least. Let me go Blane. - Calm face, there is no reason to start a fight. - Shut up, will you not see that I'm dancing with Gloria? - Man, leave her alone, okay? Go and loose it. - You will beg forgiveness? - Did you hear, man. - I have not heard head carrot. - Did you hear, Blane. So I will have to hurt you. Come here. Do not miss me? Mitchell! - She Solta. - Get a grip, this has not nothing to do with you. - Stay away from my sister. And I will not speak again. - Let her decide, Jack. - She's already decided. Now get out of here! Not over, Jack yet. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - Come on, give you a ride. - I do not need a ride, Jack. I'm here with ... All right, the Caiara is your match. Cool, let's go. - Jack, this is not your decision. - Why not sit down and discuss So eating some french fries? - What do not you take the basket potatoes and you shove down our throats? - Stop Jack. - Calm Jack, relax. I'll take you home Nikki. - Jack wants to stop acting like a stupid man-of-caves? I said I'm here with Mitchell. - She'll be a good, Jack. I take it early in the morning home. - Everything's a joke to you, man? - And all for you is so serious? She'll be fine, listen to your consciousness, my buddy. I'll take Nikki home. And there's nothing you can do. Do you understand, surfer? - What do you think I am? Some idiot. I know what you want, Jack. I'm doing it to 3 weeks. Wanting me to come into your game. I hate to break with his grace, but I will not fight you Jack, I will not. - He's scared, Jack. - He're not afraid of anything. - Is true? It is true that're scared, man? Are you afraid of me? You think playing the strong one, putting me nicknames and sand filling my closet You will make me fight you? You have no idea who I am, for I do not give a fuck about you, your school or your hockey game. I'm leaving in three months and think I'm going to waste my time with you or with anyone else? You is not worth it, brah. No one here is worth. No one. Nikki! Gloria, want a ride? I think so. Hold on, partner. Stop, okay. Stop this partner thing. I thought surfers were brave. - What did you do? Fight them all and be a hero? Yes. Have done something would be better than going out and doing nothing. - What does that solve? Anything. I know because I used to think so. - And Nikki? You let her go. - I let it go? She ran away from me. Besides not you tell me she was the sister of Jack. - I did not know. - It does not matter, man. What is the problem? I'm leaving in a few months. You really disappoint me, man. Nikki? Need to talk to you. Does not fill, okay? Does not matter. - You did not give me a chance to explain. - I know, you go away in a few months so not worth it. - That's not what I meant. Does not matter because you know what you're right, not even worth it. Wiley! Wake up man, wake up. I have to tell you something. Up, up. I had a dream ... had a wave ... not those of normal size was a big, huge, like, those who will not have another chance As solar eclipse. Tava enjoying it in the most styling. Until I saw a shark, even very large type. And his name was Pepe - Pepe? Pepe. And he began to come to me. But then he stopped. He looked at me and said in Spanish "La mia s hello" I spoke Spanish in my dream, man, because at the time I understood what I was saying. "The wave is my" Then I woke up. - I woke up at 3 by a silly dream? - Are you kidding? All we need know're in our dreams, man. They are windows for knowledge. - So what this shark Pepe mean to you? - It is obvious that Jack is the shark and Nikki is the wave. And he does not want me near her sister. La mia s hello The wave is mine. So what does it do? It comes on me like a shark. I'm trying to scare me to stay away from the wave, man! - The question is? - Is that when you have the perfect wave or any perfect thing you go after. You do not worry if you have a shark almost biting her bottom, there will always be sharks. But when another wave appears perfect like that? - What does it mean? Will fight with Jack? - And throw Gandhi in his grave? I think not. Moreover, no need to fight the shark to fight the wave ... We Wiley. - Go ahead. Do not worry. I I'm cool. All because of the Pepe. - What's he doing here? - We can talk? - No. - And when we can? After the game ... after the game. - Jack, he's not thinking in play, right? - I do not know what he thinks, but it is better to leave. - Jack, is not the best worm playing? - For what? - If you let him play, we can see he was kicked. - Really, I like that, man. - Hey people, you have room for more? - Travis, you're out. - Adios California boy. - You guys have a ... taco? - Do not stop here, man. - Get them surfer. - That. - Very good. - Go after him, Mitchel! - Get it, man. - He will face. - Soca it, we're here. - A punch will.
