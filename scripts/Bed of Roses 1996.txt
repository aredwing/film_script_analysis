Well, there's always risk, Mr. Bayard, But we've got a seasoned management team in place, An asset-liability ratio in excess of 3.5 to 1, No long-term debt. We feel confident that this Is a great opportunity for you. We'd love to include you as a major investor. Simon must have a lot of confidence in you To put you on a deal this big. When did you make VP? Two weeks ago. But it's because this is my first major deal That I know it in and out And breathe it, sleep it, eat it. Um, if you'd like to go over The cost-benefit analysis one more time- No, that won't be necessary, Ms. Walker. If all this checks out... I'm in. You're in. Really? Really. Really? That's- That's wonderful. Really. Well... I'll send you the paperwork first thing, And if you have any questions- Excuse me. Ms. Walker, a Mr. Sims is on the phone for you. Sorry. Yeah, David? Lisa, sorry to bother you, But I got a call from a doctor in Pittsburgh Regarding a death certificate For someone named Stanley Krasne. Apparently, he has you listed as next of kin. Do you know anything about this? I'm sorry. I can't talk right now. Can I call you later? Of course. Ok. Everything all right? Yes. I'm sorry. I, uh, I better hurry To catch that last flight out of Heathrow. It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Bayard. Yes, it was. Hey, Melville. No, that's collateralized Against the mortgages on phase one. We don't consider that a significant factor. 12-12 million shares? I need that by noon. I'm going to check with state again And get back to you with the new numbers. Yeah. No problem. Shoot me now. Delivery for you out at reception. What is it? Delivery for you out at reception. They'll last longer if you put A little 7up in the water. I know it sounds weird, but it works. Here. Sign here. Ok. Anywhere? Just, uh, right over there. Thank you. Thanks. Enjoy them. Oh, I will. Yeah? Hello? Hey, Danny. Did you send me something today? Like? Well... someone sent me some flowers. It wouldn't have occurred to me. Yeah. That's what I thought. Danny, he's here. Two seconds. I got to go. Ok. Bye. Hi. Thanks for calling. If you want, you can leave a message, But if you don't, I'll understand. Hi, um, it's me. You didn't, um, send me some flowers You couldn't possibly afford, did you? Um, I'm at work. Just call me later. Bye. Now it looks like It'll be four to six weeks before we can get Any functional infrastructure into place. If these numbers are right, We're looking at 12 to 16 before going on-line. Right. That should do it for now. Stay a minute? How are you, Lisa? I'm fine. Good. Take the rest of the day off. Pardon? Take tomorrow off, too. I don't want to see you this week. Simon, I'm fine. Good. You'll enjoy the time off more. Don't misunderstand. This isn't some kind of altruistic gesture. You'll have your hands full with this. I want you in top condition. This isn't necessary. This isn't a discussion. If I see you here before monday, you're fired. Excuse me. Oh! Late lunch? Oh. More like an early retirement. What? Till monday morning. Forced vacation. My sympathies. 2:00 on a tuesday afternoon. What do people do? I have to catch my breath, they're so cute! I know you will love my guests today Because they're five Of your favorite daytime leading men. The terrible news is she has 40 dog outfits, But you don't have a dog! We're going to take a break. When we come back, We'll talk about how we do this show. 48 spring street, apartment 3a. Yes, I've got it. We'll be there by 5:00 at the latest. Thank you. Rush, rush, rush. Uh, can I help you? Um, yeah, I hope so. Um, I called earlier today About a delivery I received. No name on the card. Oh, Walker, right? Right. Jimmy, you know anything about a floral for Walker That went out this morning? No. It wasn't me. Wait a minute. What am I thinking? Today's tuesday. Yep. He still must be there. "Suddenly, the boy felt the zephyr begin to shake. "The sound of the water "Rushing past the hull grew louder. "The air filled with spray "As the boat sliced through the waves. "The bow slowly began to lift, "Higher and higher! The zephyr was flying." Everything all right? Oh, I'm feeling much better. How are you doing? Uh, pretty good. Lisa Walker. Right. I'll see you later. Um... How are your flowers? Oh, um, they're- They're beautiful. Um... look, I don't mean to seem obsessive, But your boss- I spoke to him, And he said that there's no record of who sent them, And he said maybe you'd know something. I mean, I have to know, you know. Um... I have to, uh, I have to be someplace. You want to walk with me? There's nothing like Hearing a story read out loud. She's-she's great, too. A real natural storyteller. Do you go to story hour a lot? Well, I haven't been lately. She's been sick. Look, um... I, uh, I did take the order, But to be honest with you, I don't feel it would be right to tell you. I know they're your flowers and all, But it seemed really important to the person That they stay anonymous. I'm sure if the situation were reversed, You'd want the same thing. That's not very likely. Oh. Why? If I wanted to cheer someone up By sending them flowers, I wouldn't make them so crazy By not signing the card That they couldn't enjoy the stupid things In the first place, You know? It sort of defeats the purpose. You're not going to tell me? I'm-I'm sorry. Someone sent you flowers? Who sent you flowers? Listen, I'll be at Puffy's 6:30ish. Come drink adult beverages with me. Hey, how come you're not at work? All right. Let's break this down. We're running out of people who would have... Thank you. Did anyone else know about Stanley? Maybe someone back in Pittsburgh sent them. No. Mm-mmm. Not a soul. How about Captain Thoughtful? Um, it wouldn't have occurred to him. He said that. No, he didn't. Danny is, uh... Yeah. You know, he's- He's the romantic equivalent Of a night-light. You say that as if that's bad. I don't have time in my life for anything more. I'm a VP, remember? Ok, so if it wasn't Danny, And it sure as hell wasn't me- It was nobody! Somebody likes you. Stop it. Come on. Why not? Your prince has finally showed up To sweep you off your feet. It's a nice fantasy. What fantasy? You got the flowers. Yeah, but I live on a little planet called reality Where stuff like that just doesn't happen, And even if it did- Yeah? I'm not the sort of person that they happen to. It was probably just some... clerical error of the floral world. Yeah. And even if it wasn't, Prince Charming probably Would have turned out to be a dick. I'm serious, too. It's safer this way. You'd just be disappointed. I'll keep the fantasy, though. An anonymous gift from a secret admirer? I could go for years on that. And I guarantee you That even my dullest fantasy Would be 10 times more romantic Than the truth could ever be. Oh, god, you got material like this, Who wants the truth? This is terrible. Dallas. 237 people just dropped right out of the sky. Joey let you in. After being tortured long and mercilessly. What are you eating? Pork? No. It's chicken. Oh, my god. Would you look at that? I've been watching for, like, three hours. It's the same images over and over. I'm completely addicted. Oh, where's Mel? Oh, no. Really? Yep. Didn't the feeder work? It worked fine. I think he just died of loneliness. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, why aren't you at work, anyway? And who sent flowers? Can we just not talk right now? Ok. Thank you. You're welcome. Stanley? Sarah from school is having A birthday party on saturday, And is it ok if I go? I'm going to be on the road all next week. Uh, why don't you ask Mrs. Elkins? Maybe she'll take you. Stanley... When's my birthday? You don't have one. Hey. Ah! Hi. I, uh, hoped I might find you here. Look, um, The store doesn't open for another hour. Do you want to get something to eat? It's a public place. You'll be perfectly safe. There you go. Do you want anything to eat? No. No, I don't. Nothing for the lady. I'm going to have a bowl of corn flakes And a little glass of milk. Ok. I just-I came down to tell you that- I-I sent you the flowers. You? Um, you see, I, uh... I like to take these walks At-at night, mostly. I like to look up At all the darkened windows And wonder what people's lives are like And what they're dreaming about. One night, I was out pretty late, And as, uh, as usual, All the windows were dark... except one. And I stopped, and I looked up. I saw you... standing there, and, uh, And you were crying, And I thought, What was it that made you so sad? So I followed you to work The next morning, Found out your name- And you made this... incredible arrangement of flowers For someone you've never even met? Yeah. I'm really sorry if, uh, If I was strange yesterday. Somehow, it seemed really important to... to keep it a mystery. Yeah. Look, what are you doing The rest of the day? Pardon? Why don't we spend it together? What? No. No! I know, I know. This is all very strange. It's not the kind of thing I do every day. Well, that's good. Besides, if you don't come, How else will you solve The rest of the mystery? Hey. Here you go. Congratulations. These are Foxgloves. They do well in northern climates. They're beautiful. Here's Agapanthus. It's a good flower. A little finicky about moisture, though. Oh, nothing worse than a finicky Agapanthus. No. They're all going to be gone soon. Cold weather and everything. Oh, yeah. That's Heliotrope there. That's my personal favorite. Why? It reminds me of the past. There was a lot of it where I grew up. Yeah. Well, what's yours? Oh. Favorite? Yeah. I don't know. Roses, I guess. Pretty boring, huh? No. Nothing boring about a classic. So, you from the city? I-I grew up in Pittsburgh. That where your family is? Um... No. I don't mean to push or anything. I just, uh... a friend of mine got some once- Roses, I mean. They were this pale lavender gray that- Sterling roses. Yeah. Yeah? Those are beautiful. A thornless kind. Yes, that's right. Only I think they ought to have thorns to balance it out Because otherwise, they're too perfect. I don't know. It kind of seems like There's enough thorns out there as it is. I think every now and then, um, Everybody's entitled to too much perfection, You know? Have you always been interested in plants? I think my, uh, My grandfather, actually- He got me into it. He was sort of known around the house As the king of amateur gardeners. He was really, really bad at it. I mean, he had a real black thumb. You're close to your family. Yeah. Pretty bizarre, huh? No. Oh, I forgot what this feels like. Hmm? It feels so decadent. Decadent? How do you mean? I didn't get anything done today. You got a lot done. No. You know-done. I failed to earn my keep. I did not contribute To the gross national product. Did you have fun? Utterly beside the point. This is, uh, this is me. Oh. Well... uh, do you want to, uh, Do you want to come up? Uh... I'd better not. Why? Because I'm a psycho Who wanders the streets at night And follows beautiful women to work? Basically. Ha. Well, see, actually, there's something I just really would like you to see. It's not going to be around much longer, And it would, um... I mean, you don't have to, But it would just mean a lot to me If you came up and saw it. Here. After you. Have you lived here long? Uh... almost four years. Really? Yeah. Um, would you like some tea? No, thanks. It's a reproduction. It was painted as a study. It's, uh, it's up here. Need any help? It's, uh, this way. This is incredible! You're Lewis. Yeah. It was my grandfather's name, too. Actually, I named the store after him. But... you deliver flowers. I, uh, like to see people's faces When they're just falling in love Or making up from a fight, Even if they're grieving. There's something beautiful About a person's face at that moment. Yours was incredible- Confused and shocked. I have... have to go. I-I'm sorry. Who is it? It's me. God, it's starting to get cold. I'm flying to Phoenix To move in with my mother. She'll be thrilled. Get it? Nice flowers. What the hell is going on? Here. Ok, what is it? What's going on? I found out who it was. You found out- I found out, and he's great. This is who sent you the flowers? Uh-Huh. Ok. So you found out Who sent you these great flowers, And it turns out It's this guy who's great, And this is really a terrible thing because... because... why is this a terrible thing? Ok. It's ok. Everything's going to be ok. I have no idea what's going on here, but... I know. It seems crazy. No, no, no. Is this about Danny? Are you worried about Danny? No! Oh, no. Danny's fine. I mean, we... It's not like a spend-the-night kind of relationship. That's the last thing we wanted. We just keep each other around for- Nocturnal lighting purposes? So? So... I'm not in the market. I don't have any room in my life For someone who's great. I mean, I work for a living. Right. And I'm very good at my job. No one disputes this. I'm just... I just don't think I'm up for this. Oh, my god. What? It's him. Who? You get it. I... wh... What... uh... who is it? Delivery. It's him. It's... what is it? Flowers. That's what he does. He's a delivery boy? It's sort of a hobby. It's... ah... what do you want me to say? Tell him nobody's home. He's got flowers. Forget it. We've seen what you do with those. Kim! Can I please just see What Mr. Right looks like? Just... Delivery? Is Mr. Right kind of short, About 16, with a little... all right. There you go. "Thank you for a day Of too much perfection." No. No. They took a break between 12:00 and 8:00. Other than that, they've been coming On the hour. I don't know where to put them anymore. That little guy must be exhausted. No. There's another one, too. They go in shifts. I know. It's great. But he's just wasting it On the wrong person. Marry him. Marry him now. Oh, my god. This can't continue. No, no, no, no. That's not going to be enough. I'm going to need at least another 12 dozen. Fly them in if you have to. It's important. Thanks. You're going to blow this, buddy. Have you called morrow's yet? You cleaned them out about six hours ago. You're going to scare her off. I already did that. Jeez, Lewis, not for nothing, but- Randy, I just found her. I screwed up once in my life. I don't want to do it again. Rosen's- We haven't tried Rosen's yet. Hey, Pete. This is Lewis. I was wondering if you had any more... uh, I'll call you back. Hey. Hi. I'll, uh, I'll clean up. All right? Yeah. Hi. How are you doing? Jimmy, let's go. Take it easy. I cleaned out the city. It's all in my apartment. Look, um, I'm sorry about yesterday. That was all wrong. I moved too fast. No, you didn't move too fast. I'm just not used to having, uh... look, I know I don't really know you, But, uh, yesterday was one of the nicest days I've had in a long time. I just... I forgot... it's not... it's not you. It's me. Just... you're just wasting it on the wrong girl. I won't bother you anymore. You're not... you're not bothering me. My, uh... my wife painted this. She used to... to work for museums Restoring paintings. I was still on the trading floor When she did that one. See, we, uh, We met in high school, Started dating, And after I got this job As a runner at goldman sachs Working these 14-, 16-hour days, Paid my dues, got my own desk- Six months later, we, uh, We got married. She stayed home, and she painted, And I kept climbing the ladder. Then she got pregnant. One night, I was working pretty late, And I got this call. They told me that she'd gone into labor, And... and that there were complications. I lost everything in one second. So I just- I cashed out. Then one day, I saw this guy delivering flowers, And I thought, "Maybe that's what I should do. "I'll deliver flowers. "Has to be the best job in the world. Everybody's always happy to see you." I'm sorry. I'm sorry to lay all this on you. One question. Why me? I guess... I guess I finally looked up... and... and your light was on. Hey! Hey. Morning. Did you, uh, you sleep well? Yeah. My clothes? I took them to the dry cleaners. I hope that's ok. I had some things to get- So I'm a hostage. I can go get them real easy. I'm just kidding. Uh, I also got you some toothpaste And your own toothbrush And, uh, your own bathrobe So you don't have to walk around In the sheet, And there's some new towels, too. Exactly what time did you get up this morning? Yeah. Bacon- Do you like bacon? Because I wasn't sure, So I got some ham, And I got some steaks. If you're not a meat eater, You know, I didn't know. I got some of these tomatoes here And some green peppers And, um, Uh, but I don't know. Coffee. Uh, coffee- Regular or decaf? Or maybe you want some tea- Some english breakfast, Earl grey, orange pekoe? Coffee, coffee, coffee. Fine. Coffee. Uh, sweet 'n low? Sugar? Half-and-half? Milk? Black. Black? We don't actually have to eat at all. The other morning, You didn't order breakfast. I wasn't sure if that was because You weren't a breakfast eater Or because you thought I would kill you. Yeah. I... was. Actually, I'm starving. Are you? Good. Good. I must seem pretty ridiculous here. Mm-Hmm. I'm not sure, you know. Ah... you're kidding. It was amazing. He's amazing. I mean, We delivered flowers. I wore a hat. It's just... the whole thing was... just completely- Amazing? Look who's back. Hey. We'll talk later. You'll tell me everything. Hello? Yes. Hi. I'm sorry. Hang on a sec. Hello. Aha! The creature lives. Where have you been? Danny. You've been working all weekend again, haven't you? Can you hang on a sec? Um, it's Danny. Oy. Can I call you later? You better. Bye. Hi. Um, can you have lunch? Come on. Guess. You and your mysteries, Lewis. I don't know. You heard the most amazing new story? No. You bought a new hoe? Wen, you're not even trying. What? You built a beach On top of the World Trade Center? No... I, uh, I met somebody. Sam, I'm going to need the car. Well, it's a great story- Standing in the window, Juliet on the balcony. I just don't want to make any mistakes this time. I just want to get everything right. I want it to be perfect. Lewis... do you, um, Do you remember when you were- You must have been Jason's age, Like 7 or 8, And you were working with grandpa Lewis In the garden? Yeah. He was teaching me How to water the plants, and I thought If a little water was good, Then a bunch... by the time we stopped you, The whole place looked like Thailand. Right. Lake Lewis. I was very proud of that. It's just that, you know, This is your first time out there. I just... I would really be afraid To see you put too much on this. Hmm. Well, I think It might be too late for that. I think I'm in love with her. It's great. So how did it end up? He was actually pretty relieved. We'd been going for a long stretch this time. Listen, how about I come over later And maybe bring us a pizza? I can't. I'm leaving early. Oh. I... excuse me? "Snowflakes fell... " You don't remember that? Come on. Hello? The fruit cocktail. Thank you. That year, we were the only two Who didn't go home for winter break. So we went up on the roof And ate fruit cocktail And drank peppermint schnapps Until I threw up all over the place. So how come you didn't go home? My mother was going through One of her nightmare dominatrix periods. You really don't want to know. No, you don't. Why don't you tell him About the kids? I warp young minds. She works for, um, an outreach program. Explain it to him. Well, you know, We work on building their self-esteem, Working with them as a team, And every year we put on a play. For example, we put a little girl Who maybe isn't so pretty As beauty in beauty and the beast- That kind of thing. That's fantastic. Yeah, when it works. Right now we got a real tough case, though- This 7-year-old girl. What- what's wrong with her? She's... extremely bright. She builds these incredible things All by herself, But whenever another kid gets near her, the lights... go off. Do you know what happened to her? She had it rough. Her adoptive parents are really great, But, uh... they don't know what else to do. Hmm. You know, I forgot. Um... I have to make a phone call. Excuse me. So... so you must be wondering who I am. Someone who's... making Lisa as happy as I've ever seen her. But? But... if you hurt her, I'll kill you. Ok? So he went up into the stands- In the middle of the race? Yeah. He asked her to dinner, And that was it. How about you? How did your parents meet? They met at, um... at a dance, At a VFW mixer. My mom had a cold, And, um, my dad was there, too, And he was, uh... he just kept asking her to dance, And she was too embarrassed Because of her cold. She was sneezing and everything. So he just offered to walk her home, And- and they did. It turned out They lived in the same building. Wow. Yeah. And, um... they got married just six weeks later. That's a great story. Yeah? Yeah. I think our story's the best. Yeah? Yeah. Lisa Walker. When is your birthday? What? In case, on a whim, I feel like getting you something. Well, I was never real big on birthdays. Well, I want to put it down here. April 1st. April 1st? Your birthday is on april fools' day? Listen, I've got to go. I'm really busy. Ok. Ok. Bye. Hey. Hey. I tried you at work. What did you have, a late meeting? I left early. Left early? It's after 10:00. What is it? I love you. I love you, too. Hi. It's cute. I'm a jewish elf. How you doing? How's work? Oh, let's see. yesterday, I knocked over a display Of dishwasher-safe crockery. Oh, no. So today, I'm in notions. Can I have some coffee, please? So, how you been? I thought you'd fallen off the edge. How is, uh, how's things at school? Not great. I just finished writing This year's play. The performance is supposed to be the 23rd. I was hoping you'd come. Of course. I wouldn't miss it. So how's married life? Oh, come on. You're living with him. I still have my place. You're living with him. So, you two got big plans For christmas? We're supposed to go to his family's place For the holidays. Supposed to? Yeah. You know, the whole meet the family routine. You know, I play the girlfriend. I don't know what the big deal is. All the functions family used to serve Are served by friends and colleagues now anyway. I mean, the whole thing Sounds pretty prehistoric to me. You haven't told him anything about you yet. I'm just wondering what happens When he wants to marry you, Which he will. How are you going to explain Your side of the aisle at the wedding? It'll be me and me. I don't see why I have to explain anything, Kim. You're right. You don't. You shouldn't. You should just stay In your little fantasy world Because it's safe there. I'm leaving. Yeah, right. Run away. Bye-bye. Don't forget your umbrella. You know, you're just jealous. Excuse me? You'd rather I stay miserable And wait with you for a prince on a white horse. When it happens to me for real, you can't take it. For real? He doesn't even know who you are. Honey... No, no, no. Get out of there. What do you think I am- Scrooge? Thanks. You going to be leaving soon? Uh, we leave in the morning. Is she psyched? Completely. Meeting the family. Big time. Bigger than you know, buddy. Would you mind Loading the leftover poinsettias In the back of the van? It's already done. You're a genius. Merry christmas, Lewis. You, too. Merry christmas. Uh, Kim called again. Yeah. She left the information. I don't know. Maybe she thought You might change your mind. Well... I'd love to go, but... you know... I'll call her. Right. We're, uh, we're all packed, So we should probably get an early start tomorrow. I can't go with you tomorrow. I know- I know it's really bad timing, But... I should have said something before, But I thought I'd be able to get out. We've got this whole licensing mess Crashing down on us. This has nothing to do with work. W- what? I, um... I found your address book, And there's no listing in there For a Richard or Ellen Walker. The only number for Pittsburgh I found Was for somebody named Stanley Krasne. I also found... I also found this picture. Was that you and your father? I don't know when my birthday is. When I was 3 months old, I was found at the Pittsburgh airport. It's great, huh? They put me in a shelter home, Then I was placed with this couple. The woman died right after they got me, But the man petitioned the state to keep me, And they said ok, so, um... that's, um... he sold auto parts And mufflers and spark plugs. And, um, he drank, And he, um... his name was Stanley. He died just a couple months ago. That's it. Big deal. It's pretty disappointing, huh? I don't think I could get on oprah With that one. Anyway, um... I'm sorry... about all that. I'm sorry, but I- I can't go with you tomorrow. I want you to go out there. You know the play. You know what you have to do. I want you to trust me, ok? Go for it. We're so sorry, princess. We never meant to leave you alone. Please come back. Please come back, princess Amelia. I know it's easier to stay safe- Safe in your dreams, where no one could hurt you. But no one could love you there, either. Please come back, princess Amelia. Please wake up and let us love you. Then I wished he didn't have to kiss me, But then it wasn't that bad. Can we do it again? We'll see. Hi. It was- It was great. I'm going to, uh, talk to Lisa. Hey. Can I still come with you? I changed my mind. Would you grab me an apple? Can we turn the car around? They're right behind your seat. I'm going to be sick. Why don't we spend christmas at home? We can watch "It's a wonderful life" For the millionth time, Snuggle by the fireplace, Order curry from Tandoori Palace, And make love all night. Please? Nah. We don't have a fireplace. This is it. Maybe we should go in. So this is what they call nature, huh? Yeah, I suppose that's what they call it. If we leave now, We could be eating chutney by 8:00. I love you. Gee, that changes everything. You all right? Do I look like a total gumbyhead? Gumbyhead? No. You look beautiful. It's going to be all right. Mom! Hey, come on in. How are you? Good. How are you? This is Lisa. Oh, Lisa, welcome! Oh, take your coat off. Hi, uncle Lewis! Hey, how's it going? Be careful out there. It's slippery. I put Wendy and Sam in the guest room Because of the baby, So I put the queen-size in Lewis' room. Mark's old one? It's been down in the basement. Jason, stop. Say hi to uncle Lewis and Lisa. Hey, hey. This is Bob and Eva franklin. Hi. Hey, sis! This is my sister Wendy and her husband Sam.

There's another wolf. There's three wolves. See the wolf? All the little wolvsies. That's his tail. He's got a tail. Oh, look at the mountains. You climb mountains so high, it seems... hurry up, you guys! What is this? Oh, you'll see. Hey, you guys! Sam, honey? Hi, mom. Ok. Good. Here we go. See, we have this tradition That everybody opens one gift on christmas eve. Sort of a little preview Of tomorrow's orgy of greed. So, who's first? Me, me! We have something for Jas. Jason, do you want to open a present? Dad, it's right there, Under the tree, right to the left. This one? Yeah. There you go. Take it easy. Take it easy. That's, uh, David Copperfield. That was my favorite book when I was your age... or around your age. Oh, thanks. Come on. There's something else there. That's from Lisa and me. Oh, cool! The legends of Zordak 2. Hold it! I'm going to break that camera, I swear. I love this! I bet it makes perfect froths. It's got color-coded instructions for you. This is beautiful. I don't have to try it. Ok. Go ahead. I kept the receipt. Uh... Wendy? Excuse me. Yeah. Duty calls. Come here, Katie. Come here, sweetie. There you go. There you go. Oh, wait a minute! Does Lisa have something? No, no. It's ok. No, no. Lisa, let's see. Honey, right there? No, I'm... Mom, mom, no, no, no. I got this one. Here. Merry christmas. Open it. Lewis. I'll... honey, are you ok? I just need to... air. Lisa! What- I can't do this. I don't belong here. Let go, please. What is it? What happened? What did I do? You just proposed to me In front of your entire family. I thought it would be nice. I wanted to share it with them. Nice? Share? You always talk about how you don't want To put too much pressure on me. What are you talking about? You push too hard, Lewis. You just push too hard. What did you expect me to say? I expected you to say yes. Then we'd live happily ever after. This isn't a fairy tale, Lewis. Everything has had to be too perfect From the beginning. I can't live up to that. You want to rescue someone, And I was in a window, And my light was on. Uh... wait a second. Maybe that was true in the beginning, ok? But since then, I have fallen in love with you. I want to spend The rest of my life with you. You just can't admit That somebody could actually love you. That's what it is. M- maybe you're right. I mean... you have an entire house Full of people who love you And have always loved you. You don't have to question that. You have a wall full of pictures, Of memories, of children, Things I've never had. You talk about having a family. I have no idea What I would do with a child. I have nothing to give. I... can't... pretend anymore. I just can't do this. I- I can't do this. Look, I'm... I'm sorry. I... I didn't... I didn't mean to scare you. I mean, that was never my intention. I just... Uh... please, I don't want to lose you. Just don't run away. Please. I wish I... I wish I could give you something. I wish I could give you part of myself, But that's just not something I have In my possession right now. I'm sorry. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye. I... what's up with you? It's really stupid. It's been, um... it's been three months, And I can't stop thinking about him. It's like, uh, I take these walks, And, uh, I keep showing up in the same place, And I'm outside his building, You know, looking up at the same window, And all I can think of is, I want to be... there with him... like it was, And, uh, I can't even cross the street. I just feel like such an idiot, Like the best thing that ever happened to me, And I blew it off, and I don't know why. Why can't you just go to him? Why can't- Just call him! What? What do I say? "Hi, it's me. "I'm sorry I'm psychotic, But, gee, can I have the ring back?" That sounds good. How could he ever forgive me After what I put him through? I wouldn't forgive me, for chri- He might not, But don't you think that he's worth the risk? I know your life has not been a fairy tale, But if anyone deserves a happy ending, It's you. I knew you'd say the right thing. You're my best friend. You're supposed to say that. Delivery. I didn't even know If you were going to be here Or maybe out on one of your walks. I, uh... sort of got out of the habit. Hey, Lewis, have you seen my bag? I'm sorry. I'm... Lisa! Hi. Um, I was just... Actually, I have to go, Lewis. Sam will be waiting for us, And she's getting fussy, so we'll hit it. Come on in. It's really good to see you again, Lis. I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye. Put a little 7up in the water. It sounds weird, I know, but it works. So... um... how's business? Actually, Randy's been running the shop lately. Been working part-time As an investment consultant for the city. Public housing, health care, that kind of thing. And, um, and your family? They're good. Um... I guess... I guess I should be going. Um... this is the part Where you're supposed to say, "wait." Yeah, see, I'm supposed to start to leave, And- and that's when... you forgive me for being such a coward... and for being the last one to figure out What everyone else already knew. Then... You call out, "Wait. Don't go," And I stop, and we hold each other, And then we know everything's going to be ok. I- I guess... I'm not familiar with the procedure. Yeah... I guess not. Um... I guess I'll see you around. Wait. Don't go. How was that? That was good. Everything's going to be ok.
