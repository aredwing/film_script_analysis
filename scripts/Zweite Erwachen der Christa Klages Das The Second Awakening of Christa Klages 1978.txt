I'd never done much thinking about myself... Especially not in the last few days. Let me have ten. That's all. - Where are you going? - Don't be impolite. I'm going to see a friend. She's terribly inquisitive. - Is he your friend? - Yes, he's my friend, too. Stop bothering the nice lady. You know the most expensive cars in the world? Rolls Royce Silver Shadow - Rolls Royce Corniche Convertible - 177, 522. Stutz Blackhawk - Lincoln Continental Mark III - Yeah, made specially for the U.S. President. There were three of us. Wolfgang was the youngest. Please, don't get excited, sir. I'm perfectly calm. The two others got away, but we'll catch them soon. You used to cry when I went to the station. You don't expect me to do that now, do you? Don't forget to send us your sermon. I think the taxi's come. I'm all ready. I've done my best to straighten things up a little. You'll be able to find things easier. It's summer, couldn't you wear your hear a little shorter? Thanks, I can manage. - See you next month. - Bye. - Can I give you a hand? - Oh, that's very kind, thanks. You might have thought of it. Wouldn't have hurt you. Think they got Wolf? Hell, at his age I could run I'll wait here. If it falls through, I won't have so far to walk. - Hello, are you Mr. Grawe? - Yes. I'm Christa Klages, a friend of Wolfgang Prinz... Really? How is he? Come in, won't you? Did Wolfgang find a job? His parents said he was just bumming around. Yes, he found a job... I wanted to ask if my friend and I could stay here tonight... His parents live right near. I'm not here with Wolf... And they already turned us down. I really don't have enough room. - We can sleep on the floor. - No, this is my office! I can get you a hotel room. Even pay for it, if you want. I sang that cantate once. Not so nice, though. We're here for a special reason. To talk to you. The part that's coming up is especially pretty, I think. I like it too. - Just one night, okay? - All right. You can come after my confirmation class. That's very nice of you. Because you like this cantate. Don't you have Italian spices? On the top shelf. I already looked there. My mother's been straightening up again. Can I move this? Wait a second. Oh, sorry. Aren't you hungry? We thought you prayed first. Is it important to you? No, not really. The sisters used to make us pray round the clock at school. Aren't you exaggerating? No. They used to come in and wake us up screaming 'Praise the Lord'. And we had to get up and answer 'Forever and ever, Amen'. And grace at every meal: "May the Lord bless our humble..." Even Christians jabber like heathens sometimes... In Japan they eat this slippery spaghetti stuff with chopsticks. He went there as a sailor. Try it. It's impossible. That's why I never got enough to eat. Cut it, or you won't get enough tonight, either. - Typical kindergarten teacher. - Do you teach kindergarten? - Wants to cut everything for you. - And you're a seaman? - Ex. Everything's ex with me. - And what do you do now? We need your help. We started a day-care center three years ago. We had different ideas about training children from the usual kindergarten. My daughter's in it, too. At first we had only the kids of the people who started the store. But then the word got around. Now we have foreign children, children of people who can't take care of them. - Welfare children... - I'm afraid I have to go. But we'll talk about it when I get back. We don't have such experiments here in the country. I'm going out for a drink. I dont know... What if you attract attention? You just dont want me to go out. Admit it. I don't care what you do. Have you been here long? Sorry I'm so late. - Is Werner asleep, too? - He wanted some nightlife. - I thought you were together. - We are. In what way? I mean, what kind of relationship do you have? You mean, do we sleep with each other? Yeah, sometimes. That sounds uncomplicated. Enviably so. Would you like to hear a cantate? If you feel like it. What you said about praying gave me a good idea. Read it to me. Come to church tomorrow and you can hear it. I used to masturbate during the sermon at school. Do you still? I don't go to church anymore. What would you do if you ran out of money for your youth work? - Ask the District Board. - What if they said no? - I'd ask the city. - What if the city said no? I'd go to the parents. If they didn't have any money? I'd think of something. Now I get it. You need money for your kindergarten and want me to help. Would you be willing? Of course. I always am, if it's for a good cause. Hey, wake up! Where did you get this money? What are you snooping around for? - We hit a bank. - Are you serious? Yes, Hans. - Get dressed and leave. - Don't worry, we will. I knew this would happen. But first you sign a money order, so this money gets to the people who need it. We want you to send this as an official church contribution. We can't take it there. It's too risky. You want me to pretend I collected this money for you? - They need it badly. - How much is it, anyway? We haven't counted it. It's not for us. I don't want to see it. It's wrong, and need doesn't make it right. Don't tell us what's right and wrong. Just send the money. Or do you want those kids end up in a home? Ask Werner what that's like! Leave my life story out of this, okay? Are you going to do it? Of course I'm not. Think about it a minute. It'd take me years to raise that much. Even privately? Christa, the church is like a corporation. I'm only an employee. I have to account for every cent. The only thing I can do is turn the money over to the police and plead immunity. I'd advise you to do it for the children's sake. - There must be other ways. - Thanks for the sermon. I should never have listened to Wolf. Wolf was convinced you'd help us. You got him involved in this? That poor, naive kid? You don't know him. You always led him around by the nose. So did you! Don't you realize what you've done to him and yourselves? It was his decision. He was sick of people telling him to have patience. People like you! I want you to be gone by the time I get back. - You're not leaving here. - I have to go to service. - He could report us. - He won't. It would be the smartest thing. Dear Congregation, must prayer be a meaningless ritual without hope of being heard? Or worse, an alibi for not acting, a way to avoid true involvement? Instead of doing good, do we turn to prayer? This alternative is made clear in the famous scene in 'Mother Courage' where the peasants pray, and Kathrin sounds the alarm on her drum. In 1636 the Protestant city Halle was besieged by the Kaiser's troops and was in great danger. Mother Courage, her daughter Kathrin, who could not speak, and a group of peasants await the catastrophe. It's night. The town and its people are asleep and know nothing. A peasant woman tells Kathrin: "Pray, poor child, pray." We cannot stop the bloodshed. You cannot speak, but you can pray. But Kathrin climbs up on the roof of a house with her drum, and begins to beat it, waking the town. An approaching soldier sees her and shoots her dead. Her prayer is an act, and she pays for it with her life. What is Brecht telling us? On the one hand, the old woman who prays to a God who doesn't exist and cannot save the town. On the other - Kathrin, who instead of praying beats her drum and saves the city. But isn't this a contradiction Christians can resolve? Can't we rely on the words of St. Augustine, who said: 'He who knows how to pray right knows how to live right?' For Christians know that this world offers the possibility of salvation, and that we are called to put our faith in its coming to pass. Your sermon was truly inspiring today, sir. - Truly inspiring... - Can you give me a hand? Thanks. I'll lock up today. You may go now. - What've you been doing over 6 years. - I've been here the whole time. Haven't there been any changes in your life since then? Time passes very slowly out here. It passes fast for children. all of childhood. If they miss something, they can never make it up. We're the only positive thing some of our kids have ever had. Please, I'm not changing my mind. And what about me? I made that place what it is. I invested all my energy, all my time and ideas in it. I'm not going to let them take it away. Pastor Grawe! I need some more aspirin. And have you got hair coloring? Blonde, not too light, please. It's for my mother. She's started dying her hair. Why not? I'm only 20 and I dye mine already, too. - I'll cut yours afterwards. - Oh, no thanks. - I always cut my husband's. - Your husband? Most girls get married before they see the light. It looks awful. Sorry, I'm not too good at this. You've really never had any doubts? Some things you just don't doubt. It's a good feeling to carry on. My father was a pastor. So was my grandfather. So you followed family tradition. Some things aren't meaningful unless they're carried on. What my grandfather did takes on meaning through me. Doubts or no. If I thought like you I'd still be a housewife. Like my grandmother and my mother. - Doubts or no doubts. - Exactly. Clergymen are nothing but figures of fun nowadays. - One more reason to be one. - To be a martyr, you mean! Playing the martyr has its good sides. Why aren't you married? A real pastor needs a pastor's wife. The women I like can't imagine being married to a pastor. Like you. I like you. You still can go back. Both of you. You have to give some people wings. Others need lead in their boots... I wrote something in it. We'll be seeing each other again. Interesting job, pastor. Carries a lot of prestige, too. Number 3 on the list. Right after professor and doctor. Come on, admit you had a great time talking to him. You tell me I talk too much, and gab with him for hours. 'Sleep, dim eyes.' You never talk to me about that stuff. We talk about other stuff. Yeah, you went to school and so did he. And he gives you poems. Don't be stupid. I haven't read poetry for so long. And these are really beautiful. Want to hear one? No, thanks. I don't need my soul massaged. When I say get down, get down. Are you crazy? I don't want them to see there's two of us. Who? There's nobody behind us. Don't turn around! Never turn around. I was in this cop car once, and this other car was in front of us, and the guy kept turning around. So one of the cops says: 'That dude turned around twice, let's shake him down.' So they stopped him and checked him out. We have to decide where to go. To the next good Samaritan. Miss Seidelhofer, would you come here, please? Is this the woman, Miss Seidelhofer? People always look different in pictures. Do you think it could be her? Is there any resemblance? Yes, but some people look good in pictures, some look awful. I always look awful because I just don't photograph well. We're not interested in your photogenicy. Please concentrate. She has pretty hair. - What's her name? - Christa Klages. What kind of work does she do? She used to work in a kindergarten. It might be a front, though. There is a certain resemblance... It must be her, if she's a friend of those two boys, as you say. I can't be sure until I see her. We have to catch her first. The alternative number is 30. - I can't, not now. - Oh, please. You're feeling... just the same as I am. You know, sometimes I feel like crying... Not because of me or because of you. Just because of everything. You're right. It's no good. Police have been able to identify the second man. According to Wolfgang P., who has confessed, it is Werner Wiedmann, at present unemployed. Why did Wolf have to squeal on me? He's only 19. So what? I was 14 when they got me and I didn't squeal. He was jealous of you because you were good at everything... Bull. You were like his mother but he couldn't get close to you, and you don't rat on your mother. I can't make anybody looking like this, either. I liked your real hair better. We're splitting up. If they catch you with me, you've had it. We did the job together and we're staying together. Listen, you got a little kid! They don't have anything on you. You think I'll buy me a Porsche with this? I want us to stay together. Excuse me a minute, please. He's got no staying power. If I weren't married to him, I'd have... I'll be right back. Hello, Flo. - How did you find me? - Information. - Is your husband at home? - No, but I've got a customer. - A customer for what? - Beauty treatment. We can come back in half an hour. - Are they after you? - We're not criminals. Yes, I'm coming. Come on in. This is Werner Wiedermann. This is Ingrid, alias Flo. You can wait in there. You think that witch is gonna help us? - I'm not staying here. - Where can we go? I don't care, anywhere. Did you know there was so many different kinds of bats? Geez! Is she married to a taxidermist? No, an army officer. You gotta be kidding! He'll recognize us! You really don't have to be afraid, Flo. Is it true what the papers say? Yes, but nobody recognized me. With Werner it's different... Why did you become a beautician? I didn't go right on to college after I got my diploma. So I took this course and now I can work at home. At home? Why? Do you have children? No, not yet. And Mischa? How old is she now? this fall. I can't wait to see her. We should have kept more in touch. Ask her whether she'll do it or not. This place gives me the creeps. Do what? Stop bothering us, will you? Can I use your toilet? First door on your right. Werner's a little up tight. There's a bat in there. Can you take it down? Get out of here! I'm sorry, Chris. I've thought of you so often and... It was so great to see you again. But now that you're here... If Heinz finds out... When does he come home? Only on weekends. He lives in the barracks. Then it's alright if we stay here tonight? Don't you want to come along? - No, I'm busy. - As usual. So long. From that day on Lena Seidlhofer, the bank clerk, began looking for me. Who did you want to speak to? - Christa Klages. - She's not here. She's gone to her mother's and can't be reached. She's going to bring me a present. Me too. - A big present. - A little one for me. A big one for me. Like something to eat? No, thanks. I ate at home. How many people live here? - 10! - 7. No, it's 8. 5 grown-ups and 3 children. And you? Do you live by yourself? It's alright... Everything's fine. We just started buying furniture. We have to turn over every penny. How much did this place cost? - 300,000- You'll be paying for life! Heinz's job is for life. You screamed in your sleep last night. I know. Sometimes I scream so loud I wake myself up. You're alone a lot, aren't you? Well, Heinz only comes home on weekends. And goes bat-hunting. - But I've got my customers... - Do you have any friends? I haven't had a real friend since you... But I know a lot of people, or at least I did before we moved... - But when we have children... - Why haven't you had any? Heinz wants to wait till he's promoted. - I think he's right. - I don't. Not if you want to have children. I gave this to Heinz for his birthday. It says 'Please fertilize.' I want to see Frieda, there's nobody to beat her. Oh my little Frieda... No girl is sweeter... - Oh, sorry. - Come on in! How did you recognize Christa with her blond hair? The way she laughs... Her famous laugh. She always laughed like that when the teachers scolded her. She wasn't afraid of them like me. I wanted so much to be like her. Can't you give me one of your treatments? You need cold cream to do it. Well, I think I could use a little youthful invigoration. Can't you do it from the front? No, not really... It's Frau Wurm. Could you go to the living room? You're beautifiul. - Look at my thighs though. - So what? Mine are like that, too. Why did you marry Heinz? He always knows what he wants. And he wanted me. You're the type a lot of men want. - I'm not, you are. - I'm too independent. I always envied you for that. Do you still? Why did you get married? Just for the fun of it. We didn't want it to change anything. But then I realized I was doing nothing but exchanging recipes... Like we used to exchange poems, do you remember? 'Life is building bridges over transitory torrents...' 'We are nothing, our search is all...' 'Flee disappointment and you flee fulfillment...' You get to sleep together and I have to sleep with the bats. Would you start all over again? With another man, I mean? Sure. But I wouldn't get married. Especially not to him. Excuse me, aren't you Christa Klages' mother? Yes, why? I thought I might find her here. No, she's not here. I'm sure I don't know where she is. The police've been looking for her, too. - Are you from the police? - No, I'm a friend of hers. Just asking. Come on in, then. The neighbors, you know. Please excuse the way I look. I'm playing a knight's lady tonight. Amateur theatre. Otherwise, I'm just a normal person. - Take a sit, please. - Thank you. I haven't had a minute of peace since it happened. My colleagues do nothing but gossip about my children. I sometimes ask myself why they're so... different. I have another daughter, too. She lives in Berlin. Maybe it's because deep inside I'm the same as them. I don't take things lying down. It makes life bearable. Yes, Christa really felt cooped up here. That's why she went off to London when she was 19. She took care of other people's children, and she liked doing it. It's not my idea of fun. I want to enjoy life. Raising my two children was quite enough for me. So now I do these theatricals. Why don't you come tonight? I have to get up early, thanks. - Do you work in an office? - No, I'm a salesclerk. You should come. It's really a good play. Listen: 'O printhee, let thy gracious heart hear my lament and help me fight the terrible injustice they have done to me.' Since when are you ever late? Alarm clock didn't go off again? And you've had the same things on for 3 days. The memo said we're supposed to change every day. - Like the newscasters on TV. - I forgot. But I will, tomorrow. Here, at least put this on so nobody will notice. You finally got a boyfriend? Leave me alone. Could you bring me the insurance files? Thanks. Sit down, please. What foreign currency did they take, and how much? It was 4000 $, and 1300000 Lire. What exchange rate did you use? The rates from the 27th. Let's enter the rates from the 25th. But the robbery was on the 27th. We'll say the 25th. When they catch that woman, we get the money back. I thought the insurance would pay anyway? Of course, but they'll pay faster when they know who to charge it to. I see, Mr. Schlei. Try to get Mischa to come outside so I can see her. Maybe it was because she liked Werner, maybe for old time's sake, but Ingrid agreed to take the money to the kindergarten. We couldn't wait any longer... if it wasn't too late already. - Did you see that woman? - Reingard? Yes. No, the one who came out before you. Yes, we passed each other... She was my hostage at the bank! She stared at me like you are now! Maybe that's why they didn't want the money. What?! They didn't want it? Did you bring it back? But why? They need it so badly. They're afraid. You acted on your own. On my own? Should I've taken the kids along? Why did we ever do it, anyway? You mean it was all for nothing? Didn't you say tomorrow? Does it always look like this when I'm gone? Sorry, I didn't get around to cleaning up yet. Your friends seem to be really living it up here... - On my money! - No, they're paying. They even bought you a carton of wine. No reason for them to stay forever. Who slept in my bed? A friend of mine. I want them out of here by tomorrow. That bastard. No, she has to go it alone. There's a bakery. I'll buy us some rolls. And a sweet one for me? May I help you? A loaf of bread and 3 rolls, please. - You can't park here. - It's not my car. You were sitting in it. Your ID, please. I was just looking! Stop where you are! Drop that gun! What's the matter? Like some milk? That's very nice of you. - I'll pay you for it. - No hurry. Why don't you come over? It's nice at my place. All the same city? Yes, that's Riga. My hometown. - Have you lived here long? - Oh, a long time. I don't know exactly how long, because my memory isn't as good as it used to be. It's nicer here in the summer. Lots of people come out here. But in the wintertime it gets pretty lonely. You ran away, didn't you? I ran away from Riga, too. My parents looked for me everywhere. They were very strict. Please eat. My mother always cooked me vegetable soup when I was sick. I still have so much to embroider. So much... Look at these. I still have all these postcards to embroider. Sometimes I even have to work at night, when I can't sleep. I wasn't sure you'd come. - Have you got a gun, too? - Why? After all that's happened? I don't feel like talking to you if you do. I don't have one. I shouldn't have let you leave like that. - And the money? - You want me to turn it in? I tried to help you find your own way out of this. It was no good. What are you going to do now? - Keep on hiding forever? - I don't know. I really don't. I only know that I'm not going to turn myself in. You told me yourself how fast children grow up. She wouldn't see me very often if I was in jail, either. Then I don't know why you asked me to come. How did you get my name? You're an old school friend of Christa Klages. They killed her friend, that Wiedermann fellow. Who says I am? Her mother told me. You went to see her? - Yes, and her ex-husband, too. - Why are you doing this? I'm responsible to the insurance company. Why don't you leave this business to the police? I can't tell you. Anyway, you wouldn't understand. Do you really think you'll be able to find her? Your problem is that you don't think enough about yourself. Call Erich. Either he'll pick you up or tell you how to get there. I told him you need help. I didn't tell him why. I'd rather stay here. With Mischa. You have to go, Christa. Hans is going to take you to the other kids. I have to go now, but I'll be back soon. You know, when I tell you I'll be back, then I will. Take care of yourselves. For the 1st time I'm thinking of myself - by thinking of you. You'll look just like me. I didn't learn this for nothing. If they catch me, I'll say I stole your passport. Hold still. No, promise you won't. - I was my idea. - Promise. Now get dressed. Hans helped me 2nd time. He sent me to Portugal, where his younger brother taught at a German school. Tell him I'm very grateful to them for having me. Dear Hans, this is to show I'm really working. I've been here for 2 months and still feel like a stranger. Your brother helped me a lot. He comes from Lisbon every week and then I can talk to the people. They're very friendly to me, but I can't speak Portuguese. I see how important being able to talk to people really is. They want you to sing a German song. But I can't sing. - You can't let them down. - I can't think of any. Oh, just sing 'Am Brunnen vor dem Tore' or 'Die Gedanken sind frei', or 'Sah ein Knab ein Roslein stehen.' No, thanks. Oh, I remember one. Where is Little Jacob? He drove the cows into the woods and never came back again. His sister and brother went to the woods to look for him, calling Little Jacob, Little Jacob, come home. - Did you have to wait long? - Yes, forever. - It's good to see you. - Yes. Let's have something to eat. Didn't Heinz try to stop you? He would have, if I hadn't told him I was going to mother's. I bought a ticket to Zurich, and from there to Lisbon. - Good thinking. - I had trouble at customs, though. The customs official thought I had the stolen passport. But then I explained to him that it had been stolen from me. Did that girl from the bank come back? No, but apparently she sits around the day care center after work... She's not budging an inch. It's weird... I'm glad you budged, though. We helped the farmers peel cork trees. Women's work - picking up all the little pieces of bark. Oh, my back. Mine hurt at first, too. It would be great if Mischa could be here with us. - You really want to stay here? - Yes, I like it here. You haven't had a nightmare since you've been here. So it was Heinz. You're not scared of him anymore, are you? Since I've been here I almost felt sorry for him. I understand him better. You liked Werner a lot, didn't you? As much as you. Werner and I... We always had our hackles up... Were always picking at each other. And when we got tired of that we robbed the bank. - Not just because of the money? - Sure, that was important, too... But maybe if we'd really loved each other, we wouldn't have needed it. Let's go. Look at my hands! I can't massage anybody with these callouses. You should see my knees. If Heinz could only see me now. I have to talk to you. You can't stay here any longer. - Why not? - Manuel heard about the robbery. You didn't tell me. Hans didn't. That doesn't have anything to do with our work here. It's a difficult situation. They're closing down some cooperatives and they can't afford to risk anything. - And then... - What? There's something between you and Ingrid. Manuel didn't say what. You know women here... think in really old fashioned terms. You have to respect their customs, don't you think? The idea of doing something useful with the money kept me going... After I left it in Portugal, I felt paralyzed. The former tenant left those curtains here. You can pay for them. I'll have the leaky faucet fixed. - When's your furniture coming? - It's coming in a few days. I'll fix the faucet myself. You're staying here now? I had always tried to change things if they didn't satisfy me. I thought I could help myself and others. Not anymore. - Why are you moving out? - Ask him. He's the one who threw us out. Are you the owner? I sure am. Why are you evicting these children? Is it any business of yours? They're 3 months behind on their rent. Just look at it. Look at the mess they made of that shop. It's a pigsty. Look at the filth. A sex shop's your idea of clean, I suppose? At least they pay rent on time and don't make any noise. Very clean. BE ABLE TO WAI Can I speak to Ingrid? When can I reach her? I had tried to reach Ingrid several times, but either nobody answered or her husband did. I didn't know then he'd thrown her out. Christa, what're you doing here? I thought you were long gone. Are you crazy? What if somebody sees us. I was gone. Where are you now? What are you doing? - Alright, don't tell me. - How is Mischa? I haven't seen her since they closed the kindergarten. So they threw them out, huh? Reingard's taking care of a few of the kids at her place. - What about Eyip? - I don't know for sure. You better go. Give Mischa a kiss from me. So long. Can't I do anything for you? 'When you are old and grey and full of sleep, nodding by the fire, take down this book, and slowly read, and dream of the soft look your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; How many loved your moment of glad grace. And loved your beauty with love false or true, but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you and loved the sorrows of your changing face." Why don't you open the door? - I'm sick. Go away. - I'm responsible here. There's something has got to be fixed. The faucet's leaky. And when you move out, you'll have to repaint the walls, you know. Would you like a beer? I can go buy some. No thanks, I don't drink. Are you alone here? Sick? I'm not really alone. I have a daughter. She's 5. Haven't seen her for a long time. She needs me. She's starting school this fall. It won't be long until I move out of here, though. I was out of the country and didn't know where to go when I came back. So I couldn't see my daughter. But I'm not really sick. I'm feeling much better. I know where I'm going. You can't live in this place. I just didn't know where to go. I'd never been alone so long in my life. I couldn't even get up anymore. I had the feeling I would never get out of that room. Then suddenly I couldn't take it anymore. I think about Werner a lot. But I still can't believe in what happened. - It's all my fault. - No. - You shouldn't say that. - But it's true. Two checks for 1.000 each. With this message: "Even utopias have timetables." Who could they be from? That's nice. Excuse the disturbance, but your neighbor called again. Your kids are just too loud. It's not that we care, but when people complain, we have to come. Be a little quieter in there! So, you can go now. What if they recognized you? I was in hiding long enough. - Christa Klages? - Yes. You're under arrest. Try to remember, Miss Seidlhofer. Take a good look at her. Could she take off the glasses and stocking? Was that the woman? No, I'm positive it wasn't. THE SECOND AWAKENING
