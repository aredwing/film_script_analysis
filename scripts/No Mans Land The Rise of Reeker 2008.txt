The, uh, Drifter? You never heard of the Death Valley Drifter? No. Killed dozens out here in the desert. Kinda funny, huh? Death Valley. You get it? Death Valley. Uh, at the, uh, filling station up ahead, I'll let them know you need a ride. It's a sad state of affairs when a man can't trust a fellow man. Damn it. Okay, I can do that. I sell supplies to machine shops. I used to be a welder myself, but it's much more exciting on the road. If I had stayed in the shop, I would have never earned such a colorful nickname. I know. I'm getting to it. They always say practice makes perfect. Freeze! On your knees! You have the right to remain silent. Anything... anything you say can... Help. I need backup. What's your 20? At the old Shrader Ranch Road. - John's at the school. - Now! I've caught the Death Valley Drifter. You have the right to remain... Deputy! They tell me my work here is done. I'm yours. His parents were victims of unsolved murders. He served in Vietnam. He had the highest enemy body count in his division. His not-so-positive record refers to him as an unpredictable killing machine. Do you enjoy killing people? Do you enjoy analyzing people? - It's a job. - Exactly. It's a job. But it's not a job if you don't have a boss. What about the voices? Voices? What do these voices say? Killing in this world is practice for my afterworld calling, that I serve at the universe's discretion until my earthly body is completely decayed and I can kill no more. How would you feel if I told you that these voices aren't real? You think you know what's real? Nobody knows shit. The only given in this world... everyone has to die. Can't say how proud we are that you're the new sheriff. We owe this to you... a true hero. Do you really think he heard voices? Or do you think he was just angling for an insanity plea? It sounded like bullshit to me. So are you really buying a home in North Dakota? Well, I always said I wanted to retire where it's cold. It would be nice to freeze my ass off for once. We're gonna miss you, Sheriff. Thanks, darling. Mmm. You are exactly as Mom described you. Your mother doesn't know me. She didn't know me when we were married, and she sure as hell doesn't know me 40 years later. - Top you off? - Whoa whoa whoa. Can you give me another cup, please? I get a balance going with the creamers and the sugars, - and they always... they mix it up. - Yeah. Whenever there's a new girl, I park my spoon right on top of my cup, but you'll learn soon enough, won't you, dear? Whatever you say, Sheriff. Is she new? Yeah, she's from LA. You two have something in common. Wow, we're both from the second-largest city in the United States. - Amazing. - Out here, you take what you can get. - Asshole. - Hey, that asshole is the new sheriff. What is that smell? I'm cleaning the grease trap. Did someone take a shit in the grease trap? You've got a mouth on you. I say it how I see it. Excuse me, the toilet's clogged. It was already clogged when I went in there. - Of course it was. - It's gonna be one of those days. Going? It already is. Shouldn't we be doing something? - Look, son... - Harris. - Harris, it's a different pace out here. You'll get used to it. It's just... first day on the job, and catching up with a father I hardly know, - it's all a little... - Overwhelming? Yeah. You take the lid off the tank and check the float. Make sure it doesn't stick. You want me to fix it? And be sure to wash your hands. You might need this. I'm afraid to ask what you were doing with it in the kitchen. Well, then don't. There was a bloody shirt. - That's all? - "That's all?" Well, we are the only public bathroom in 100 miles. You'd be surprised what you find. Well, surprise me. - Do you really want to know? - Yes. - Do you have a strong stomach? - Yeah. - A shoe... - So? ...with a foot in it. - No. Oh! Come on. Come on. You all right? Fuck! - Did the bleeding stop? - No, my t-shirt was soaked. - We've gotta get him some help, man. - I'll be okay. - Okay okay. - No, really. Come on, man. We gotta get him to a hospital. Let's go. Stick to the plan. - Did you put 40 in the pump? - Yeah. Fuck. I cleared out the corner office. What do you say we get you moved in? Oh, before I forget, I got a call about a missing man... Indian. Family said he wandered away from home a couple of nights ago. He had been drinking. Keep an eye out. - One second. - Armed men stormed the casino, ordering patrons to their knees. While the customers were held at gunpoint, one of the men barricaded... Well, that's not surprising. The only thing standing between all that money and anybody that wants to take it are a couple rent-a-cops clocking minimum wage. ...suspects in this brazen daytime robbery. The suspects are armed and considered dangerous. They were last seen in a blue four-door sedan. Any information... Maya. What are you doing here? Maya, I need your help. - You always need something. - This is serious, all right? And cheating on me with my sister wasn't? Whatever you're selling, I'm not interested. I do appreciate whatever pull you had in helping me get this job. Well, everyone deserves a second chance. What is it? - I don't wanna see you. - Look, Maya, listen to me. I have a friend in the car who needs to get to a hospital. I'm gonna leave him here. When I do, you call 9-1-1. - All right? - What's going on? Oh, shit. Get back... back. Nick, I need a physical description - of the casino robbery suspects. - Copy that. Three males... two Latinos, one has a shaved head. All right, we have a visual. I need you here at 6 Corners for backup. - How many of them? - Just get your ass over here. We're gonna let them go. We'll pull them over on the highway - away from the civilians. - We don't want to let them out of our sight. - Let's move right now. - Hey, get back here. I am still the sheriff here. It's my last day. It's my call. - Where the fuck are you? - There's a problem... 2:00. No, don't... don't look right now. Freeze! Where's the keys? Shit. All right, against the car. Hands on your head. Whatever I'm about to say, I'm lying. Don't move. Let him go. She's dead if you don't. I swear to God. Let him go. Please, just let him go now. He's lying. Shoot him. Look, our friend is dying. We don't want to hurt anyone, I swear. We just need to get him some help. I'm a doctor. I can help your friend. We just wanna get out of here. Nice and easy. You can take me instead. Keys. Help me. Where are you guys? - Fire! - Run, go! - In here! - I've got you, buddy. - Harris, leave him! - Help! Nick, where are you? I need you here now. Officer down. Send medical and fire. Let's go! Come on! - What was that? - Earthquake. Come on! Hurry up! Let's go! - I couldn't save him. - You were out. You tried. We left Carlos in the car to die, man. - He was gonna die anyway. - You said the guards were unarmed. Look, don't go blaming me! I didn't do this alone! Because you said no one would get hurt! If we didn't have to stop and see your girlfriend, - we wouldn't be in this shit! - What did you do? - We've gotta disappear. - Our car. I'll find another one! What did you do this time? I just hope the epicenter's near us, because if there are any casualties in the city, it'll be a long time before we get any help. - Where are the fugitives? - They ran behind the diner. - With the waitress? - Yeah. We have a hostage situation. Hello? Is anybody there? Do you read? I think we should make sure everyone else is okay. I'm gonna go find a landline. No no no, just sit tight. Sit tight. We don't want to get ourselves killed here. Backup will be here at any moment. - I should just walk away. - Fine, leave! It's what you do when things get tough, you leave. Go! - Adios. - See you around. I don't think so. We've got a cop car or a grey four-door. The grey four-door is hers. Well, what are we waiting for? Keys. Tell him where the keys are, Maya. My purse, in my locker, inside. You go with her. I'll make sure we're not followed. They should have been here by now. Look, there's a hostage in there, okay? And there's other injured parties in there possibly. It doesn't help anybody if we hide. Yeah, well, it doesn't help anyone if we don't have a plan. Look, let's all move together to the back door and we'll make a call on the landline. Nobody. Phone's static. Should we go check the motel? Yeah, let's go. Where did all the people go? Where's Ravi? Out of here, where we're going. Hey, you smell that? What? It's rotting flesh. You don't smell it? I have anosmia... no sense of smell. - There's such a thing? - Blind people, deaf people... - they get all the attention. - Well, I guess if I had a sense to lose... People and animals with no sense of smell are twice as likely to die prematurely. Bad smells are nature's warning. Nature's sure as hell warning us. Are you okay? Base, there's been an explosion. Code 13. It doesn't look good. I don't see any survivors. You don't see us because we're back here. Hello? Nick? Hello? Nick? Base? Anybody. We're still here. We're okay. There should be a body in here. There's... there's no way he walked out in one piece. The physics of an explosion like this, it's beyond our comprehension. - Maybe it... - Made him disappear? Yeah, well, I'm gonna go try the base radio in the car. - What now? - We get the fuck out of here. You're not gonna get away with this. There's no sunset. Give me the fucking keys! If I don't? You will. Maya. What are you gonna do, kill me? No. No, I'm not gonna kill you, but Binky will. You wouldn't let that happen. Well, I guess we're gonna find out, aren't we? Huh? Someone wrote out their will in the guest comment book. People who stay here are obsessed with death. The few who actually know how to write. Doctor Al. Allison. I'm Harris. Hal's son. Your wife left you for your captain. You roughed him up, got kicked off the force. - Word spreads quick around here. - Don't worry. Most people who live here are running from one thing or another. And you? I own a horse ranch between here and the Halfway Travel Oasis. I work at the hospital in the city. Whoa. That's still wet. The other workers... what do they drive? The cook lives here with his wife. She's in town with their car. That's everyone. Maybe we can carjack, huh? There hasn't been another car since we got here. We're in the middle of nowhere! - What do you want me to do? - I should put a bullet in you! Binky, listen to me. Put the gun down, please. Put the gun down. I will find the keys. I'll find the keys, okay? I'll find them. All right? I'll find them. That's the spirit. The septic tank traps the solids, lets the water seep through a bed of gravel. There's usually a clean out on top. Yes, the one job you kept for over a week... Randy Rooter. So respectable. And a waitress is what, huh? A start. I have plans. You've got plans. What's this? It's the clean out. - This? - I don't know, but it's next to the tank. We're going down. Oh, it's a bomb shelter. The tank's on the other side. Someone's been injured. Possibly the hostage. Whoever else was here left. The tires of my motorcycle were slashed. Yeah, well, they don't want to be followed. So you're the little shit that robbed the casino. Fuck you! Oh! All right. I ain't doing it. Ah! He's gone. We lost him. What the fuck are you doing? Help! It's that. It's the purple rabbit-foot keychain. Be careful. Alex? Asshole. Not funny. Boo! You were worried. No no, I heard you. There's still something there. You still care. Yesterday I hit a skunk with my car. Killed it. I cried. It doesn't mean I wanna be with a skunk. You were still worried. We keep our eyes on him until help comes. If we have an opportunity to rescue the hostage, don't you think we should? What the f... What? What do you see? We're screwed, Maya. We're never gonna find those keys. - You're screwed. - They could be anywhere. They could, but they're not. What are you talking about? Psych. Payback's a bitch. You didn't. Look, if this means we're even, l... We are far from even. I just swam through shit for you, Maya. See, that's where you're wrong. You swam through shit for you, so you could leave with your boyfriend. You have never once done anything just for me. I didn't come back here for your help. It wasn't supposed to happen, all right, Maya? I came back here for you. I did. I came back here for you. Look, Maya, please just come with me. Okay, I have money now. We can make a fresh start. What can I do to change your mind? Just go. He couldn't have gone far. He couldn't have gone far. Drop the radio. - Kick it towards me. - You're not gonna get away with this. - I already am. - Freeze! Drop the weapon. - You drop the weapon! - I said drop the weapon! I said drop the weapon! Guys! Oh shit. What did you do to him? - I was standing right here! - What about your partner? He was with me. He was running away. He was scared of something. I didn't touch him! Hey! Don't move! Don't move! Hey, he let the hostages go. It's not worth it. Are you all right? Yeah, same story, different day. We need help... now. I'm walking up to Hertel Ranch. - It's two miles up the road. - No, I'll go. Hey hey hey, no one is going anywhere. We are the help! We have listened to you enough already. You have lost control of this situation. Doc, go check out the old man. Look, backup is on the way. - We cannot count on them. - We have no choice. They are not coming! It is no surprise you spent your life alone. Who could put up with you? You don't know anything about me. Whose fault is that? Now why don't you just throw your little handbook out the window and start trusting yourself? What are you so afraid of? Take plenty of water. Be back by sundown. Hey, take this. This is Mr. Anderson. He was scheduled for surgery today. Surgery? He wasn't expected to survive. How did he wander all the way out here? You know, there's a precise nature to the wounds. It looks as if they were made with surgical tools. It's just strange that someone would kill him this way. How's that? He was scheduled for open-heart surgery. - What's wrong with you, man, huh? - You stink. Hey, you know what? I got the keys, didn't I? Pull over. Oh, come on, Binky. What now, all right? Stop the car. I could take a shower, all right? I'll take a shower. Stop the car and get out. - What are you doing? - I'm starting over. Are you okay? Did you see that? What? You really didn't see that? God. You haven't made any weapons? You don't know where you're at, do you? 6 Corners Travel Stop. Almost. My people tell the story of an evil darkness that lurks in the space between the light and the dark. That's where we are. If you do not go peacefully when Mother Nature calls you back home, this darkness will come and take you by force. Are you Leonard Eaglesmith? That's me. Yeah, your family called in and said you were missing... wandered away from home. You had been drinking. Something terrible must have happened to me. All right, all right. Look, why don't you sleep it off, huh? We'll set you up a room here at the motel. You'll feel better in the morning. I can fight back, and I will not die lying down. Well, I mean, I can't make you stay. You haven't broken any laws, but I think you should consider waiting with us out of the elements. I warned you. What is going on?! .' I tried to scold you.' .' But yesterday you had already gone.' .' You know, you move so fast.' .' You're a solitary breed.' .' Yeah, everybody loves you.' .' That's a solitary... .' "You are trapped between light and dark, night and day." That's what Eaglesmith said. Where are you going? To find him. What's wrong with you? Binky, your head, man. What? What?! What? What? Maybe you should lie down a little bit, you know? I don't want to lie down! - What did I hit? - I don't know. Something doesn't want us to leave. What's going on, Binky? Here. Well, don't leave me. Eaglesmith! Eaglesmith! Don't be an asshole. Slow down! You wanna know what the problem with me is? You. Ever since I met you, you... Look, this is not the time! I'm freaking out here! Come on, man. I need you now, more than ever. Oh yeah, look who's being nice now that they don't have a face. What the hell is wrong with you? Hot! What the... water! Water! Don't just stand there. Water! - Water? I don't have any water. - We've gotta do something. Just... Come on, help. Are you kidding? - I can't do it on command! - Just try! - Don't look at it. - I wasn't. I hope that's not my share. - Carlos? - What happened to you? Badass black thing's chasing me around with a flame-thrower. - Black thing? - It's hunting everyone here, man. - Hunting? - Watch your backs. You smell that? I have a cold. I don't have a nose. I wouldn't stick around here if I was you. Carlos. Carlos, wait! Carlos! I think he's in trouble. I found these. He's probably passed out somewhere. You could smell the booze from a mile away. If any of the prophecies are correct, we're not the first to face this, - and we won't be the last. - That's just a lot of hogwash. "An evil darkness lurks"? Listen to her. She's right. Any luck with the phone? Couldn't get to it. Oh, there's just a little matter of an invisible wall that's keeping us all trapped here. That and a smelly ass Grim-Reaper-Iooking thing performing lipo on an Indian man in a shack off old 13. Eaglesmith. See? "See?" She says "See?" Now I was hoping that you would think I was out of my mind, at the very least sarcastic. I would pour you a coffee, but I think you need this. Thanks. "Rotting flesh. The smell of death. Beware the Reeker." Whoa whoa whoa, let's not jump to conclusions. Well, what about the old man then? Well, call me crazy, but I would tend to believe that the armed robbers were responsible, not some ghost with a hygiene problem. Add up the clues. - It's called detective work. - Where are you going? To protect us. Will you come on? Come on. What, you're worried about the cash? - What about your face? - Yeah, right. Now I got nothing. I can't even afford to buy a new fucking face. You can buy a face? Well, for the right price, they can make a man into a woman... filet and fold your penis right up inside. Why not? How could you even be alive? Well, chickens live with their heads cut off. Yeah, for a few seconds, but they don't talk and they sure don't walk. I swear, if I get out of this, I am never doing anything bad again. I'll volunteer. I'll sing for the needy. - Oh, check it out. - What? It's clean, it's green and it's mine. I'm not sticking around. Freeze! Okay, don't shoot. Please take me to jail. Okay? Please take me to jail. Look, I give up. I surrender. Okay? You saw him, didn't you? Yeah. Yeah yeah, I saw him. Down on your knees! Now! I don't think he's going anywhere. There's a problem with the world... it ends. - Now! Now! Hands behind your head. - Okay okay okay. We could use the help. He's not gonna be much help when he's under arrest. Look, I just think we should stick together. Armed robbery, attempted murder, resisting arrest. You have a sworn duty to enforce the law, kid. I told you there was no sunset. Maya, make sure they protect you. Maya, please. - Maya, don't ignore me. - Keep on moving. Maya! Look, he had half of his head missing, okay? Now I don't know much about science, but I know that when your brain's showing, and part of it's missing, that, you know, you should be dead, not walking around. This all happened in a car accident with an invisible wall? - I swear. I swear to God. - Sheriff. Clues. That's not what killed him, you guys. It was this... this black ghost with a flame-thrower of all things. I swear to God. He's responsive with normal reflexes. He doesn't appear to be drunk or on drugs. - It's incredible. - What? Your heart... it's beating, but it's so slow. You should be in a coma or dead. You're the doctor. All of us. It's like we're in some sort of walking coma. We're not quite alive and not quite dead. We're in between? Well, we can't hurt ourselves. The only thing that can hurt us is... this death. We need to make a plan. Yeah, well... my plan is to have a good meal and take a nap in one of these lovely rooms. - Sheriff. - Listen, hey. No, don't leave me here alone! Please. I'll stay. I like it when fish fuck. Excuse me? I said I like it when fish fuck. Are you serious? Why lie? Either all of this isn't real, or we're gonna die soon anyway. Whichever it is, all bets are off. We might as well be honest with each other, you know? Under water? No, in a bed. Yes. I saw two dolphins doing it in an aquarium once. It was... it was hot. Not that I would want to fuck a fish. You know what I'm saying? I just... something about it. It was... you know? I mean, it was... I once stole a quadriplegic's wallet. I needed new shoes. Hello? Hello? I thought we were being honest with each other, right, Deputy? Listen, Deputy, I was kidding, all right? Deputy? Deputy? Deputy. Deputy! Hello? Help me. Hello? In here. Someone, please help! Hey, Deputy. There's so much blood. Help. I can help you. You can't. Thanks for trying. Look out! You know, if there was a radiation accident at the power plant, it could have messed with the electronic transmission. Have you seen the people who stay here? I'm not gonna sit around here and wait to be proven wrong. I'm with you, Sheriff. There's no Tooth Fairy, no Santa Claus and, on my life, no soul collector. - Excuse me. - Yeah. Hello? Hello? Hello? What? - Is everybody okay? - Ravi? Deputy. Who is there? Is there somebody there? Who is it? Your worst nightmare. Hello? Hello? Everyone has to die. Oh my... Deputy. It's cool. It's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool. It's cool. Somebody help! Help me! He just dropped. He fell. Come on. Okay, lie still. Lie still. This thing threw me. Threw? It was trying to kill me. Okay, you have a fractured skull. It's a serious injury. I need you not to move. Lie still. I'm gonna go get some ice to stop the swelling. You... I need you to keep an eye on him. - Yell for me if he stops breathing. - No no no no. - What do you mean "no"? - No. - Why not? - What? What the fuck was that? This is a taser gun. It fires an electrical current. It'll temporarily disable your victim. Look, hey, how about a gun for me, huh? Don't press your luck, pal. Here. What have you got here? Answers. What else do these voices tell you? They need good killers in the in between to collect errant souls. How does that make you feel? I'm one of the chosen. I don't feel. I'll work till I rot away, then someone else will replace me. They will always be training new killers. It's always been and will always be that way. Have you even considered that what you are doing is wrong? Never. This was a big deal. You never talk about it. I thought he was insane. But the voices he heard were right? I don't... I don't get it. This thing is a serial killer? Was. Was. Whatever it is now, it's also trapped here, working for... death, I guess, taking people's lives who are supposed to die but don't wanna die. What are you writing? I'm making sure other people know who we're up against. Well, what about us, now? Well, if there's nothing left of him, he can't hurt us. We have to completely destroy him. Hey. What do you say we do now, Sheriff? Kill him. We need a timer. Well, there must be a clock around here somewhere that we could use to reconfigure. We need a trigger that's gonna release the gas at a steady rate - to create vapors. - Follow me. We fill the tank with gas. - When it swishes around the bowl... - Vapors. This will give us about 15 seconds before the vapors in the bowl ignite. Perfect. I... never actually caught him. Who? If it had been up to me, he would have gotten away. I ran. I'm no hero. So? So... I lived a life I didn't earn. I was always afraid that you or everybody would find out what a fraud I was... so I pushed people away. It would have been nice to have you around, - hero or not. - Yeah, I'm sure. Look, I know I've never been much of a father to you... and I'm not sure I can ever make it up to you, but I want you to know that I'm gonna try. There will be time. I really hope so. But if there isn't, I just wanted you to know who your father really was. Yeah. I'm gonna go help the kids with the gas. Dad. Yeah? Be careful. Thanks... son. Sheriff? Harris! Sheriff! Yeah? Sorry, I was getting our pilot light. - Is my dad not with you? - No. - He didn't help you? - I didn't see him. Stay here. Hey! Hey, asshole! I'm back! Did you hear that? No. Hey, any luck? - There it was again. - What? It's another explosion. Oh dear God. He's breathing. Heart's beating... barely. - He's lost a lot of blood. - No kidding. But we can't help him if we die. Come on. Your time will come. Nick, where are you? I need you right now. Officer down. Send medical. Send medic... You made this town safe. Copy that. What's the 20 on the suspects? Sheriff? Sheriff. Hey, come here. Don't worry, okay? I've got your back. It's all right. What are we doing? When he gets close, we open the propane valve, we flush, we dive in the bomb shelter and it's "Goodbye, asshole." No. I mean, what are we doing? Us. Living in the moment. If we're actually living. - Anything? - I'm not sure. Do you see that? - No. - Lights. - No, what? - A cop car. - No, hey, Maya. Maya, Maya, Maya, wait! - Hey! Help! Help! Come on. Come on! Maya, in the shelter now! Hey! - What are you doing? - I am not letting you die here alone. What, are you crazy? Maya, don't! Take me instead. Come on. I'm easy. Psych. Payback's a bitch, isn't it? Copy that. So what's the 20 on the suspects? Sheriff? Sheriff. Hey, there's been an explosion. Code 13. It doesn't look good. I don't see any survivors. All units respond to 6 Corners Travel Stop. We need fire, EMTs, coroner stat. Miss, don't move. Help is on its way. He didn't make it through surgery. I told you. It looks like you owe me 20 bucks. There has been an explosion at the 6 Corners off the old 64. Two survivors en route. Tag them and bag them. Yeah, we got a male Native American deceased. It looks like the vultures and the coyotes beat us to the punch here. Log your coordinates and run. Report to the 6 Corners. Officer down. You're the little shit that robbed the casino, huh? If you weren't toast already, I'd kill you myself. Oh, he's gone. We lost him. Too bad. You've got a punctured lung and a couple broken bones, but you're gonna be all right. He saved your life. - He did? - Yeah. Listen, honey, do you remember anything about what happened? There were gunshots. The gas pump exploded. We ran, and we were fine. And then I blacked out. Never mind. I found the rest of him. He has massive head injuries. My father... did he make it? He would have wanted you to have this. I was using the restroom. When I heard the big boom, I call for help. That's when I heard the second big boom. - You say there were two explosions? - Yes. In here! Harris, leave him! Nick, where are you? I need you here now. Officer down. Come on, hurry up! The thing threw me. Copy that. What's the 20 on the suspect? Sheriff? Sheriff. - Where is the babysitter? - You know. You told me. I told you what? What to do with her. - No, I didn't. - Someone did. Someone did? To practice. The voices said it was my duty. Voices. Where is she? Exercising.
