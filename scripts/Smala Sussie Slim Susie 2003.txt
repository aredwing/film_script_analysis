It began in Stockholm yesterday morning. Open up! I'm an Independent publisher. I've only really published one book, so far. Which I wrote myself. - Erik Svrd Publishing. - HI, it's Sandra from home. With the red hair, except it's black now. Slim Susie's gone. She's been gone a week. You haven't heard from her?. SIim Susie Is my little sister back home. She's very proper. Writes Christmas cards in September. Very uptight. Stupid fucking pencil! What was she like when you last saw her? Well, she was... - Go on. - I hitchhiked home to find her. Nothing had changed In three years. When I left three years ago, the kiosk girl was knocked up. Things do go slowly in the country. I knew my sister had moved, but it was only 200 yards. I had to leave her behind. I couldn't take it. The last straw came on a Sunday, at the weekly movie. The movies came just about when they were released on video. But with a lot more scratches. Yeah, the movie ran out. They forgot the last reel. Which sucks. But I'll try to sort it out. Hi, it's me. Fine, and you? You've seen Pulp Fiction, right? So, how does it end? Oh, really? That seems confusing. What happens to the colored guy? Well, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but... John Travolta dies coming out of the bathroom. - He does? - Bruce Willis shoots him. - The colored guy does fine. - Good. It's not my fault. It's Stockholm's. But now you can do things at home. You can rake leaves, or something. Thanks, bye. - Where are you going? - Where they don't show half a movie. - Stockholm. - Do I take care of Mom alone? - I want to go too. - It's too dangerous. It's full of junkies who jab people with syringes just for fun. - It's too rough for you. - It's rough here, too. I'll die if you move! You asshole. Susie! I can't come to the baptism. My VCR is busted and there's a game on. Is my sister home? Tore Tumor. Known for the tumor he used to have in his head. After the operation he couldn't speak. Which caused problems. Like when he got his pension papers in the mall. He didn't understand the numbers. Just lots of zeros everywhere. Tore thought that was unfair. That's Tore for you. Had a kid That means we're family now, Tore. My sister wasn't the mother. She didn't even live in the apartment, but next door. Shut upl Baby sleeping I figured mom might know something about Susie. It seemed likely, at least. Erik! How nice! Do you want cookies? You! Don't stand there sneering. Think you're some big shot. Just because you have a company. My son runs a company in Stockholm. And yours? Do you know where Susie is? She didn't know. She was busy with her booze. See my gorgeous daughter. I signed her up for the Miss Motor pageant. She's going to win. Mick Thirteen. The most inept petty thief in the county. Or just very unlucky, I don't know. Like the time he got out of jall- - and found out that he'd inherited 100 grand. And the wrong car stopped. A stock broker. Third generation networks are a good bet. But for blue chips, telecom is the thing to go for. Really? Telecom? Grits' answering service. You're in line. We'll take your call later, or you can leave a message. - Who was it? - Some guy. Not Billy? He's so easily riled. You're not filming, are you? No, no, no. - Hiss it: "I'm sixteen". - I'm sixteen. Now, try fourteen. Are there no normal people here? There's lots of normal people. Everywhere. There's not much to tell about them. Gunnar, set the alarm 15 minutes early so I can blow-dry my hair. Good night. The only thing with these two Is that he's jealous. So, he's sewn shrimp into her pants. You set it to It's important, to give me time to blow-dry my hair. There's one thing I can tell about her. Can you hear what I'm saying? No? Good. I just need to talk. No one listens to what I have to say. It's just too nerve-wracking. There's so much noise. I need silence. When you're in the womb, before you're born, it's all quiet. And when you die, I suppose it's quiet too. Between the two, it's just noisy and I can't take that. That's all I wanted to say. Thank you. I tried to find Sandra, the girl who'd called. All I knew was that she was cute and had some last name. Not a lot of information, really. I was sad that my pizza "Erik's Extra Everything" was gone. - Hi, Erik. - Hi. It's me, Susie's friend Sandra with the piercing and red hair. - Except I took it out and went black. - Hi. It had been foretold that Sandra's love would be a latino man. She was supposed to meet him in an elevator. But the fortune-teller hadn't said which elevator. There's two of them in town. Elevators, that is. Can I get something on tab? Acalzone and a schnapps? Erik, isn't it fucking odd that no one's seen Susie for a week? No one's seen her since she paid her tab on Sunday. Tab? Susie was never in debt. - She kept a household budget. - She used to, but not now. She ate the same pizza, morning, noon and night for three months. - Pizza? She was such a health freak. - Health freak? So, what do the police say? Well, I guess you can say... Didn't you use to have red hair? Billy Davidson, the sole cop in town. A Stockholm native sent here against his will. Well, I guess you can say... Could you get rid of that fly there? It just looks disgusting. I guess you can say that these things happen. Things disappear. People disappear. - Maybe she walked the dog? - She doesn't have a dog. How would I know? Dogs get borrowed, people dog-sit. Yeah... You shouldn't offend me. We should avoid offence in this town. Can't you tell what it's like? Paper, paper, paper. I'm choking on paperwork. Break-in, nursing home medicine cabinet. Naked man in the supermarket. Moose hunting in town. See? I'm drowning in paperwork. But I do get some tip-offs. Ever heard of Keyser Soze and Tony Montana? - No... - Nope. They're not mentioned in any police files. How far do these reach? 100 yards? I have no one to talk to anyway. It's 40 miles to the nearest... And look at this. Four minutes of talk time, then the battery goes. And it takes two days to charge the fucker. I'm ashamed. I sit here in shame. That's how it is. That's my lot, to sit here in shame. Susie wouldn't just go. She's damned reliable. She's not the Susie you think. She'd never have dated Grits. - Grits? - Yeah. But it was a mess. She was in love with someone else. Erik? Grits and I wentto school together. We did a lot. Collected Star Wars figures, put rocks on the tracks- - rented movies and opened our first beer together, But he also ran into the driving instructors car- - when he was getting his bike license. Erik! Good to see you. We're making a movie. Come in. Hey, Grits. Are you and Susie... No one cleans up around here. That just sucks. Have a beer. - Beer smells great. - Who are these guys? Good guys, working class. Not that they have jobs. So, just good guys. We've had a two-day Scarface conference. That's why they're wasted. We did all the lines. We tried to email the guy who made the movie, which was hard. The connection just sucks. Shoot! Shootme. Yeah, there you go. Grits really loves movies. We've made 50 movies together. "Deadly Murder" was probably the best one. THE END It was not that bad. - Morning beer smell rules. - Why am I filming? For a documentary about me, to leave something behind. I'll die one day, like everyone does. - Are you working? - Don't have the time. Sit down. Don't you want this one? Yeah, it's Grits. Right. Yeah. Hey, what are you on? Can you get me some? - Screw that. - Who was that? - No clue. - So, are you dating Susie? Damn it, the laundry. Nope, never dated Slim Susie. Not that I noticed. - Cut it out! Yes or no? - Naw. She'd sleep here sometimes. She'd bring a pillow. I never touched her, not someone's little sister. I swear. Haven't seen her for a while. - She's disappeared. - Well, that explains it. What was she like last time you sawher? - Drunk and unhappy. - Why? - Too much to drink, I guess. - Cut it out! I'm worried! Why was she unhappy? It happened at the opening of the sports hall. The Chimp from Electric Banana Band was there. After the opening he split, and left her alone. Screwed up with love and memories. For a while she thought was pregnant by him, but she wasn't. It was probably just the pizza. Sandra, if anything happens to me, look in the drain pipes. Why didn't she tell me? Yeah, why didn't she? What a crappy sister. Siblings stay in touch. I've got something to comfort us. Vino Shito, right from hell. It's orange flavored. - I have a sieve... Ah, screwit. - Who uses this? You can add other stuff for flavor, pizza crust, pepperoni... - None for me. - You drain the bacteria culture... - Why'd you tell that? Makes me sick. - It's important. You need all the details to know I'm innocent. If you're lying, I will be sorely vexed. When I get sorely vexed, I get really mean. - You're lying! - No. - It's true. - Good. Go on. Settle down! I've got something awesome to show you. - We'II take the Humpmobile. - I'm goingto the cops. - My awesome thing first. - Does no one care that she's gone? First the awesome thing. Then we care. - But you've been drinking. - Let's go. I can bullshit the cops, or anyone else. Yeah, I can. - Get in. It feels kinda American now. They call it Little Chicago. Or Very Little Chicago. I don'tremember. Here's something mega-awesome. Something to survive crappy days. Check it out. A video store. Awesome. Gerd! Get out here. Look who I found. You're back. Didn't do well in Stockholm? - I did great, but Susie's gone. - No wonder, with her lifestyle. - What kind of "lifestyle"? - Ignore her. She's annoyed, 'cause she got arrested for assault. Check this. A movie about me, "Grits Nr. 1". I'm working on the sequel. Few get to star in their own movie without screwing someone. There's a powerful scene where I almost die, choking on dinner. - Real scary. Rent it. - Well, that does sound interesting. Hard fucking work, too. You don't just shoot. Everything has to be right. Light, sound... Action. Shut up. Damn... Answer it! It's that damned German again. He's stalking me. Hey! There's an awesome scene where... Closed. For emergencies, call the police. You need a ride somewhere? Fuck. I knew where Billy Davidson lived. He might still have my souped-up moped. Hey! Look what I found in the glove compartment! Moonshine! Grits has always been like a turd. A floater that won't flush. Fuck. No one ever fills up the car. Damn it, Grits! You're supposed to steer it! Shit. The bad luck won't end. Poor Grits, having to do time for drunk driving. But I felt it was probably the best thing for him. - Quick coffee? - Yeah. That's awful decent of you. I don't know what to say. I guess we could organize a search party. It seems sort of early, and I have a few days off. Overtime compensation that I'd like to use. - Is she dead? - I doubt it. I mean... She could be, but I doubt it. Why? Has she been ill? - No. - That's why the search party is off. Normally, I'm spontaneous and quite likely to organize searches. How long has she been gone? What day is today? Want milk? The wife demanded a porch, or she'd leave him. They've been on the rocks for a while. How do I know? She visits for a humping sometimes. Cops' wives are like everyone. Here's a coconut cookie. The wife made them, with coconut. Guess what? Mom thinks dad is bad in bed. She said so on the phone. But I can teach you to make the bed, daddy. Have a coconut thing... Cut it out! You should be looking for Susie, not offering cookies! Uffe, turn it off. I've told you not to ride around on seized property. - Park it. It's not yours. - But he got it for his birthday. Go in and tell mommy you have to go to the bathroom. You can take it. It was your moped, right? You can take it later. The matter is settled. - What are you thinking about? - Billy Davidson. No real cop would behave that way. He knows something about Susie. He's just overworked. Cops have a damned hard job to do. Just be happy you got your moped back. I'd rather have my sister back. Don't worry. I'll tell you a story from my life. It's similar to this. But I have to do it in English, or I'll start bawling. I don't want to do that. - There you go. - Who do you think it belongs to? - Fix the potatoes, Gunnar. - That's not my thing. For God's sake. You know how to lift a pan. Jeez. Those are good potatoes, King Edward. Oh, my God... Grits's answering service. - That's Davidson's wife. - Yeah. - How disgusting. - Yeah. - Really, Gunnar. Turn off that filth. - Yeah. Stop making noise, or I'll call the police! I know the policeman, and he knows Gunnar and my mother too. That might work in Stockholm, but in Vrmland we want quiet. There might not be a law on the books, but there's an unwritten one- - about not making noise and respecting people. I'm glad you turned it off. It's not that you're a bad person. I over-reacted. I just had to vent. Thank you for listening. I'm tired of your made-up buffoons. Just admit your guilt. No. There were many people involved. They're too weird. Most crimes are committed by normal folks. - They're normal ordinary people. - Normal? Imagine Saturday night here, with all these people. - That was interesting. - That's about how it is. Try that in court. I'm sure it'll go over well. Go on. You slept at the pizza girl's house. Erik, I think Susie's dead, and a lot of people know it. Even Davidson. A while back, I saw something weird in the video store. - A lot of talking in this one? - Hardly any. I'll take it, then. Put that away. - Can I have a bag of candy? - Sure. Some for the kids, too. If he can be bought with a B-movie and some candy- - he's cheap. If she's been killed, he knows who did it. And someone gave him candy to keep his mouth shut? Damn it, I can't sleep! Two other people were sleepless. Tore Tumor and his baby. The baby had colic every night, and the mother had left- - after having read something about equality. Sandra, if anything happens to me, look in the drain pipes. How often did you see Susie before she disappeared? Occasionally. She'd just gotten so weird. She just wanted... ...cash and to talk about The Chimp. - What Chimp? - What're you making? - Disco powder. - Disco powder? - Now i'm really getting spaced out. - Don't worry, it'll pass. - I'm back. - It's starting again. - What's with that powder? If things are so boring, why don't you move? I'd rather be a ducky in a pond than in the ocean. Wow, well said. That was really well said! - Yeah, it was. - I have to write it down. - Yeah, you do that. - I should write a book. A book about myself. Bridge to the chorus... This is just so good. - No, it sucks. - Whatever. It's a free country. Hey, Susie. Make the book about a girl drugging her brains out. - Hello, Susie. Can I ask something? - Go ahead. This dump has the lowest educational level in the country. How do you feel about that? It's not bad, actually. Makes it easy to be smart. - But you don't seem smart. - Exactly. But I am. I just pretend to be dumb. Here in the countryside, you're supposed to be... ...just plain happy and dumb. - What? Was she doing drugs? - Yeah. Didn'tyou know? I thought you knew. - Where'd she get drugs from? - From work. The nursing home. - More. - One more time? - You need to pay the jukebox. - Here you go. - I tried to get her to quit. - Why'd she even start? - I just don't get it. - I should've called you much earlier. She kind oflooked up to you. A lot, actually. - Who, me? - She missed you. Grits got her started. In the grocery store, of all places. She was hardly eating at all at that point. But she had to care for your mom, too. So when mom made a fool of her self for several times... You can't just fire me! There are laws even here! I've worked here longer than anyone! I only had cough syrup, that's not illegal. I want my job back! - Go get Ralph! - Settle down, now. The customers want people like me, you goddamned fascist! Are you sad? I know what that's like. I've probably been sadder than anyone in the county. See? I look like some gym teacher. You can't be too sensitive. You have to find a way to perserve. Just act dumb. Then people will leave you alone. Check this out. Brown sugar. Smoking smack. - What? - It's a prescription against sadness. Or baldness. Wanna try it? - She's not dead, you know. - Yeah, let's decide that. Good. Positive thinking. Let's talk about something normal. Something normal? I had a huge crush on you when you lived here. Really? Well, I certainly didn't notice. - I was pretty popular. - Susie said you were a virgin. - No, no... - She said so. I thought I'd fuck myself to death, but it worked out. Guess what? I had my fortune told a while ago. The fortune-teller said I'd meet someone from another culture. But I don't know any languages. Maybe it was you. Does Stockholm count, you think? I don't know... - Hey. I actually dreamed aboutyou. - About me? Lots of times. But I've stopped doing that. It doesn't lead to anything. That's what happens when you do it too much. - What was that? - A crow? That night, I dreamed of my little sister. Someone, please help me. Someone, please help me. Grits! - Come in. Movie's just starting. - You'd better help me, Grits! Help you? Have a problem? Got something to sell? Screw it. Come on in. - There are four junkies in there! - Just the four? It should be packed. We're having Kubrick night. - They're always full. - I think Susie's dead. I borrowed a tape of Clockwork Orange backwards. The entire movie. We look for hidden messages. There one scene where it sounds like he's speaking Swedish. Imagine that. Alex speaking Swedish. She died, like in my dream. You have to tell me what you know. - Cut it out. You could die. - Well, so could you. He did try to quit sometimes. Last time was three years ago, when I left. - Erik? Do you think I'm an idiot? - Naw, it's cool. Thank you. My parole officer was impressed that I'm not a mean drunk. Then he said I was enough of a loser to be drunk forever. - What do you say? - Try being sober for a while. Sober? Ithink I'll try that. Seriously. Never take any drugs ever again. I think you can reach your goals. - As long as you have a vision. - So, what is your goal? It doesn't really matter. Get on welfare, maybe. Hard these days. As long as you have dreams. I know this guy who claims unemployment. Part of the system. He's had a house and a wife. That's going to be me. Happy. What? It's low-alcohol beer. Okay... - Who killed my sister? - You're riled up. - We've got to catch this on film. - Who killed my sister? - Damn camera... - Do you know who killed Susie? It wasn't me. Or anyone else. Where's the camera? Hello? I think we've already had this conversation. - Do you know German? - No. Damned German, calling all the time. He's stalking me. What's this? - A regular Makarov. - What have you used it for? I took it from Tore. He got it to shoot you when you were breaking in. I was kind enough to take it. Tore ain't too bright. Hey, it's me. Yeah. He understands. Stop writing me! We will never go bananas together! Signed, Claes the Chimp. Someone, please help me. She was so happy when she won the Miss Motor pageant. It's a pretty nice contest. The neighbors called. I'm technically off, but... - They said a druggie was breaking in. - I've seen nothing. - How'd you getin? - The unlocked door. - Been fighting? - I wouldn't hurt my sister. Back off. There are even people who murder themselves. You don't get a free pass just because you're siblings. - There's a hole here! - Talk to the landlord. - It could be a bullet hole. - It's a hole, nothing more. Tidy up in here, and go back to Stockholm. I can't really guarantee your safety anymore. And I don't want to catch you here in town again. Damn it. And I don't want to catch you here in town again. Wait! Are you okay, Thirteen? Mick Thirteen always treated me well. I got to sit on his shoulders when there was a crowd. It was Papa Dee. He'd gotten dirt in his carburetor. - What bastard did this to you? - I did it myself. Yourself? I felt so guilty, I just wanted to die. It's about Slim Susie. I should just start at the beginning. Susie and Blow Dryer Woman work at the nursing home. - What's that smell? - It's crab, I'm sure. - Ignore it, and work. - I'm exhausted. - It happens. - Hey. Did you do get a hair cut? No. I've just blowdried it, I getup a bit earlier to have the time. - That's clever. - Yes, it's practical. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that about cutting your hair. And now, dear, you'll have a freshly made bed. - Should we wake her? - No, she's going to sleep anyway. You know what? I think she died. She's not alive now, anyway. So, anyway... BlowDryer Woman found a strong box of money. While they were cleaning up. Something's happened. I found money in the wardrobe. And I was thinking. We should share it, Susie. We've helped Mary a great deal, and there's no need to tell the others. And I felt that... Because I like you so much... ...I wanted to share it with you. - Okay. Let's see. There's about 20000, so that's 10000 each. Just between you and me, you know? There. Debt all repayed. - Pay me interest too. - But I have a pizza tab. Stop it. - Will you stop it, already? - The money. Never! - Fuck. - The money! - Who'd you get it from? - Gudrun, the blowdryer crab woman. - She found 20 grand, and I got half. - Half? Are you sure? - Trust only yourself, Susie. - No thanks. I'm quitting. I've heard that before. Now, go watch the movie. Gerd Johanson, the biggest drug dealer in the county. Once a month she goes to Oslo and gets as much as she can. A lot. Then she adds a zero on the end as markup. She never does any of it herself. Except a joint, at parties. Watch out. Do something. You've reached Ninja status. Use a throwing star, or somersault. - Or a spear. - Or make him vanish in a puff. What's that crab smelling woman called? Which movie? This one's all Hong Kong guys. - Gudrun. - Right. She's wearing a fur. She screwed you, Susie. That fur is worth more than 10000. The hag has more money, and I think you deserve it. There is absolutely no risk in stealing stolen money. - Really? - Especially if it's from a non-biker. - I've never seen her on a motor bike. - No, just a bicycle. - I think she keeps the cash at home. - You do? You don't put it in an account if it's stolen. - You take charge, Susie. - Okay. How much can an old woman have saved up? Half a million? Damn! Tore immediately ordered an upscale baby carrlage. BABYSITTER WANTED Tore hadn't slept for weeks, and looked forward to a normal life. He was exhausted. I wasn't the only one spending in advance. Gerd didn't do the jobs. But she still demanded half the money. There's rumors about her. Some say she's a man. Or that she's not really 43. I don't know. Rumors always fly about the wealthy in this country. - I heard you got some new movies. - New movies? Yeah. Watch this one. Quite a simple story. A woman is robbed of money she's stolen from an estate. An estate? And after that? Some yahoos breakin and steal the money. - What about the police? - She doesn't contact them. And if she were to, the cops wouldn't do a thing. Sounds good, I'll take it. And some candy-for the kids too. - And some for my brother. - Go ahead. So Susie organized the heist against BlowDryer Woman. Quite impressive. Mick. You distract Gudrun going home for lunch at ten of twelve. - You mean 11.50. - Right. Grits, you take her husband. He bikes at quarter of twelve. - That's 11.45, Grits. - How do you mean "distract"? - So he doesn't make it to lunch. - OK, that's no problem at all. - I'll just thump him. - No, none of that. And you keep guard outside. - Doesn't he get a time? - No. If something happens, toss a bottle through the window. - Like a Bat Signal. - Stop smoking. It fucks your mind. I've been smoking for ten years, and haven't noticed anything. I'll show you. Hold this. That's not bad. The big day came, and Blow Dryer Woman was chatty. She told Susie she'd quit and was getting a divorce. - What happened? - Going home yesterday... I heard a powerful song on the radio, and I'd just had enough. - Know what I mean? - Yes. I don't know who was singing. The lyrics went something like this... Want to hear? Don't think me silly, but it's great. It's meant a lot to me. Here goes... I mean it. Gunnar will have to get himself a new maid. That's Girl Power. Go home and tell him. Yeah, Girl Power. Iwill. What the hell is this? I handled my end perfectly. Who parked this brown car here? Hello? But Grits wasn't there to stop her husband, Gunnar. Grits had been so scared of oversleeping- - that he'd rented the longest DVD-box he could flnd. Hello? I can't talk. I'm watching this really deep movie. The Catalogue, by some Polack. Kieslowski. Nine hours. Susie knew the money would be where the husband wouldn't look. Damn... What's for lunch? Gudrun? Are we having pork pancakes? What are you doing? I'm starving! Where are you? I need my lunch. Alright, I'll eat at the burger stand. No problem. God damn it. It didn'tmean to. I fell asleep. I had a party for this little guy. - They must have spiked my drink. - With alcohol, maybe? - Could be. - Shut up. -How much was it? What? This is 2000. Why is she getting some? - He. - She wasn't part of it. - Neither were you. - He's a boy. - Is this all of it? - Yes, Gerd. - It's not enough for a carriage. - You're talking. Tore was counting on the insurance. So he pretended to be brain damaged after the operation. - What a Jesus moment. - Did Jesus talk a lot? I'm out. I don't want to see you anymore. See you in my book. - Is it done? - Two minutes. I'm leaving. Want to come? We could live together. Don'tknow. I kind of like it here. Kind of. Kind of... She's just chicken. - What? - Nothing. If something happens, if I don't go, call my brother in Stockholm. I'm sure he cares a bit about his sister. Why don't you call him right away? You think he wants to see me like this? - In this one? - Yeah, unfortunately. Sorry. Well, goodbye. Hey! Sandra if anything happens to me, look in the drain pipes. And then? Then she went home and got into the tub. - Where's the money?! - God damn it, Tore! - Alright. We'll just leave. - This is for real! - I'm tryingto solve it. - We can't just leave. She had a gun. It was totally selfdefense. A gun in the bath? Are you nuts? - We'll say Tore killed her to death. - That stinks. How about this? We write a suicide note. - She couldn't take it, and... - You goddamned moron! Tell the police it was an accident. They wouldn't get it. They're just so damned suspicious. Don't trust people. Gerd went bat shit when she heard about Susle. She ordered us to move the body to...somewhere else. What the... - Who took the body? - I have no clue. - It's just weird. - It's all my fault. Thirteen is snitching. There's more money. Don't worry, Erik. Puke all you want. I'll clean it up later. Nothing to worry about. There. You sit in the front. - Come on. We're class mates. - You didn't come to the reunion. You upset everyone. I'd made a killer punch. - But that was two years ago. - That's nothing. - I'm putting the baby seat here. - You can't bring the kid. You drive, Mick. - How much do you know? - About what? - Like us shooting Susie. - Are you slow, or something? - I have something to tell. - What's in the bag? What smells? It's crab, but nevermind. I have something to confess. It's just awful. Shouldn't you be taping this? - Interview with Gudrun... - Mrtensson. - September 30th... - My maiden name is Karlsson. That doesn't matter. You need to stand a little closer. Or you'll have to speak up. I can hold it. I bought these with stolen money. A blowdryer and a fur coat. I took the money from an estate. I'm fully prepared to do my time. I thought I needed to change my life. That can be quite costly. I booked a trip I haven't paid for yet. I just wanted to get out of this mess. Ouch. You can leave a message at the tone. - Oh, hello... - God damn you. - You were in my apartment. - No, I wasn't. This was in my kitchen. No one else writes love letters to The Chimp. Pull, you stinking little brat. - Open up, Susie! - Damn. Open the door, Susie. I should have split the money with you. I'm sorry about that. I don't know what happened. Now I want to. - Where are they? - I'm sure you know. I need the money more than you. I'm starting a new life in Stockholm. You're not the only who wants a new life. You're all set. You're a youth. Pretty, slim and attractive. I deserve the money, too. 22 years I spent at the nursing home. For 22 years I've been sitting at death beds, listening... - The money's not here anyway. - I'll smash your damned Chimp photo! No! Put the photo down, and I'll tell you. Here's the deal. I hid them, but I don't remember where. - I don't believe you. - I can well imagine. I was high as hell, and I hid them somewhere clever. - Clever? You can't find them. - The cleverness wore off. You'll never be clever, Susie. Know this: I'll always be smarter than you, you stinky old hag! You bastard! I picked up the suitcase and came back. And then the mailman helped me pull the suitcase to the car. The same day they buried the old lady who had saved 500000. No one suspected there were two bodies in there. I don't think I believe you. The tub has a bullet hole. She must have been shot. What are you doing? She was dead before she was shot. It's all on this tape. You go stand over there. You, too. - One question: Where is the money? - Take it easy. I don't know. - I swear. - You do it. This is like a movie. Stand closer together, so I get both of you. - You can't shoot me. - Didn't we want the money? He knows nothing about that, but does know we killed Susie. - Oh, right. - I don't know where the money is. I can't do this. We collected Star Wars stuff together. - Shoot. - Calm down, Gerd. Erik, do you still have your laser swords and the starship? He was into Obi-Wan Kenobi, and I dug Princess Lena. Shoot, or we'll all go to jail. I'll be in until I'm 90. - Could you do it yourself? Please? - Calm down, Gerd. - Unbelievable. - But I killed her first. Here's what we'll do. We'll just let bygones be bygones. Mostly for your sake. And for her I'm making a porch? People are so damned phoney. Damn it, Gerd. Grits. I'm down at the mill, dealing with things. - Who is this? - Listen. Leave my wife alone. - Who was it? - Tore. He's at the hamburger stand. - So, what happens to me now? - Nothing. You can go home. Take the fur coat and blowdryer with you. - Screw this, Gerd. - You're staying. No. I'm not doing this childish crap. I quit. - I told you to stay. - No. I'm going to clean up my life. Start doing normal, reality-based stuff. Not just drink beer and hide my baldness. - Yeah, real smart. - Smart? Do you mean it? Thanks, Gerd. You're the first person to call me smart. Smart... What the fuck are you doing? What the hell? Gerd? What the hell have you done to Grits? What's the matter with Grits? Gerd? You've gone too far, Gerd. Come on, give up. I just turned on the alarm, so all cars are alerted. Davidson. Yeah, good. Bye. The walkie talkie has no range. It's from 1987. Pure crap. OK, good. Bye. That was them. They'll be here soon. Are you the only one here, Gerd? Davidson. I don't have time to talk to the press. Who tipped you off? Alright, but make it quick. Some damned junkie woman here has... Why did you run, if you were innocent? I don't know. - Where's the blowdryer lady? - We kept running. And when we came to the kiosk, there she was. She seemed to be choking, from a Grits and mashed potatoes. Where's the money? I - Unbellevable. - But I killed her first. Oh, shit... Sorry. - Who are you calling? - The cops. Not the cops here. I'll talk to them in Stockholm. - I'll join you. I've had it here. - I gotcha. Wait here for me, and I'll go pack my bag. Wait here! Damn it. I hate sad endings. The interview cassette is in the stereo over there. If Susie had been my sister, she wouldn't be dead. To each his own. It's a free country, unfortunately. Let me go now. If you tell a single person that I got a little sad... I will kill you. Yeah. Bye bye, hometown. Or? Look. ERIK SVRD SLIM SUSIE Translation: John EThelin Priredil: Pelish
