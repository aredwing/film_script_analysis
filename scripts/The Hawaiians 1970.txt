They told us we shouldn't mix Punti and Hakka together. Mountain and valley people have hated each other for years. Punti and Hakka, they're all Chinese. They all bring the same price in the dock in Honolulu. They won't bring us a dime dead at sea. Damn! Who brought her aboard? What name you? I said no women aboard this ship. She looks none the worse for it. Would you like her topside, captain? Who belong you? She belongs to me! She's my wife. Well, damn your eyes. Did you pay her passage? Passage all paid. The name is the same, Son of Ti Chong. Look at the contract, you'll see. I'll do that. And, i'll teach you not to try any more tricks... you smart bastard. Nail up the hatch cover. No food and water for 24 hours. Give them something to think about. Aye, sir. - Watch out for him. - What for? He's dead. More shark meat. You'd think they'd know better. How many does that make? Seven all together. I'd hate to lose money on my last voyage on the Carthaginian. You're sure is your last? Your grandfather is not going to like it. Unless you're taking command of a newer ship. From now on, i'm shorebound. I've got a scheme bigger than the old man ever dreamed. He'll love it. We'll miss you, sir. The Carthaginian is a good ship. Maybe i can talk the old man into letting you have her. If we can keep enough Chinamen alive to turn a profit. I learn you Pidgin, you savvy? I learn you Pidgin, you savvy? Ship, you say. You say. "Shhhhhip." "Shhhhhip." Ship! Ship! Bed. Bed, you say. Bed! Bed! Pakes, this side... Move along. I'll miss things about the sea, but not that stink. Can you spy my wife, Mr Morris? No. Is hard to see anything with that crowd seeing the lepers off. You there, stand clear. Come along, now. Come along. Chop-chop. I see why you mean to quit the sea. Purity! Purity! Whip! He says her name is Char Nyuk Tsin. You, Tsin. You belong Island of Mauie. You are Prohilde. Next Pake. You, boy. He says his name is Kee Mun Ki. Too long. We call you Kee. You belong Janders and Whipple, Island of Kiwai. Next Pake. You, boy. This the girl from the brothel of Spring Nights in Macao? She's Hakka! I want half my money back. She healthy? No mark up? She's not for sale. What the hell's going on here? Me buy woman. You told me she was your wife. Sure, she's my wife. See? Me buy. Me want woman. Whip, if she's his wife, you can't let them be separated. Is none of my business. I don't know who's cheating who. He cheat me. Me want woman. Whip, couldn't they work for us? You bet. Me cook, in whorehouse in Macao. Plenty fine house. All right. We'll give it a try. You just bought yourself a wife. Maybe you're lying to him, but you better not be lying to me. Come on. Aloha, Pakes. Aloha! Aloha! This your house. Hey sister, how about one drink? Ship. Ship? No ship, house. No ship, house. Bed. By damn, some Pidgin, you learn pretty good. Whip, please don't go back to sea. I couldn't stand it. I won't. You know... we should have a Hoxworth shipping line with schedules... instead of just tramps sailing here and there. If i can just convince the old man. We can make Honolulu the crossroads of the Pacific. Your grandfather died six weeks ago. I didn't want to tell you until... Was that too selfish of me? No... I'm glad you didn't. Is like a main mast breaking. You don't believe it can happen until it does. I didn't expect such a gathering of the clans. I thought the will had already been read. Hello, Malama. Why so glum? Must be the company you keep. Is good to have you back. I wish you'd seen grandfather once more. Cousin, Micah. The will has been read, Whip. Some time ago. Perhaps you'll want to look it over privately. No, I'm only interested in the ships. I imagine he left all the other businesses to Malama and you. If you read it, you'll see that he left the shipping business... all the businesses to us. What the hell do you mean? You get Hanakai Plantation, free and clear. Hanakai? 85,000 acres of nothing. He always said is the only mistake he ever... Did you put him up to this? I had nothing to do with it. If you think my wife did, you're wrong. I don't. The only thing I've ever held against her is marrying you. I loved that old son of a bitch. And he loved you. Whip... At the end, he was obsessed with the old missionary families. He said they left all their sons rich... but he didn't have to do that for you... because you could make it on your own. He provided you with an option to buy the Carthaginian... out of earnings if you chose to stick to the sea... which he advised. He wasn't married to Purity. Granted, but he knew you better than you know yourself. Now, we're prepared to make an offer. For Hanakai? You name it. No, we agree that Hanakai has no value. Assuming you don't want any favours from your sister... we'll give you, not lend, but give you... funds enough to buy the Carthaginian outright. I don't want a gift and I don't want one stinking ship... I want a shipping line, a scheduled line. I want it enough to eat crow for it. All right, Micah, you've got the ships. Let me organise it, run it. Micah, thas a wonderful idea. But impractical. You have no business experience. You've been a hell raiser for too long to turn respectable now. You're prepared to give me a ship just to get me out of here? No. If this offer isn't enough, name your price. There's not enough money here to pay my price. I envy the pious... they can be bastards and never know it. Captain, the name's Overpeck. What? I'm opportunity knocking at your door. I'm a well driller and I can make Hanakai bloom for you. Like hell you can. My grandfather tried to find water there for 20 years. I know all about it. He dug six wells. All down to caprock, all dry. That right. But caprock ain't deep enough. The way I see it, id be... Excuse me. You wouldn't have a drink in the house, captain? Come on in. You've got a lovely place here. Is that your grandfather? That him. A fine figure of a man. Will you be going back to sea? The whole island knows about the will. Coconut telegraph. You're a queer bird to be in the water business. That a fact. Look... these two volcanoes built this island. The lava flowed from both, overlapping, building up in layers. You've got to be able to read them layers. You can? Yes, sir. Like a chart at sea. I've been reading Hanakai. I've got the only drill... that can bust through the caprock to milk them layers. If is so easy, why hasn't anybody tried it before? Because... these pious fool believe that if God intended them to have water... he'd have installed fountains. Where's this drilling rig? In hock, for 900 dollars. If you're broke, make me a deal, and I'll steal it back. I can get the money, whas the deal? Whiskey and grub money for every day it takes. Too cheap. I was hoping you weren't all hot air. Nice to have met you, Mr Overpeck. Don't make a mistake, that was the price of a dry well. If i find water, and i will. I want 3,000 acres of your land. Have a drink. Foo Sen is a very wise man. We do what he says, savvy? Savvy. You're going to have a boy, his name is Kee Ah Chow. You, girl. You understand me? The wife of Kee Mun Ki lives in China, in the Low Village. She's naturally the mother of all his sons. You'll care for all of his sons... until he returns with them to his wife in China. You understand? When baby comes, I take care, yes? When you're delivered of Mun Ki's son... his wife in China will change her name to "Mother of Wu Chow." The mother of five continents. How am i called? Your name will become "Aunt of Wu Chow." The Aunt of five continents. When baby comes, I'm the auntie? In China, man, he bring baby. I bring very good. His name Kee Ah Chow, all same Asia. Asia? That little Pake? He'd better have broad shoulders. Pakes very strong. Pretty soon come, Africa... America... Australia. I forget other name. Here... for luck. Whip, there's something... What wrong with me? There's nothing wrong with you. Just hurry up and have that baby so we... Wu Chow's Auntie. I'd be deeply grateful if you could manage to... that is if you still have enough? Missy doesn't have any milk. Missy's sick? No, she'll be all right. The milk will probably come in a day or two. Thank you, more than I can... Who told you, you could start a garden here? Making money, I sell in town. Don't you have enough work? I give you half, all right? Why do you need money for? I'll see your family's fed. Take money, buy land, buy this land, maybe. You can't buy this land, is practically in my parlour. Anyway, Chinese don't buy land. They take money back to China. I'm never going back! All right. Grow what you can, and keep the money. I may need to borrow from you someday. Overpeck! Overpeck! Damn! Damn your scabby, rummy soul. Hello, love. Get out to that rig. You can take that food right back down the hill. He traded the last batch for booze, he can work hungry for a while. Food from garden, doesn't cost anything. Then take it in town and sell it. Pretty soon, water. Pretty soon, dry hole. Dry hole number four. Come on, get in here. Garden food belongs to me, you said. Any whiskey in there? What makes you so sure he'll find water? Not sure. No sure in China, I come here. I have baby, garden... alongside great man Hoxworth. I think pretty soon water. What the matter, honey? I don't know. Maybe is too soon. You're fine, the baby's fine. Hell, it seems like a year to me. I don't want to stop you. Good night. Purity... what are you doing? Thinking back a thousand years or so. Thinking of the first canoes that came up from Bora Bora. Why did our people come here? Our people? A little Hawaiian blood doesn't make us natives. It does if we want it to. There was no one here and they came thousands of miles. Who knows how many lives were lost in those canoes. The missionaries, the whalers... the Chinese, it was easy for them. But, not for our people. They were magnificent, Whip. Is coming, I promise you. You've been saying that for two years. Is coming, i can feel it, thas why I've got you here. I can hear it. I've got the land and now, I've got the water. The only difference between a sugar planter and me is money. Don't you want to see me turn respectable? You're not just asking for a loan? You're trying to blackmail us. That right. I'll disgrace you a lot less as a planter than a beachcomber. - No. - You'd be broke again next year. There's not money enough in sugar to pay for irrigation. The water is free. But, not the labour to dig ditches and keep them open. You know very well, we'd have to foreclose. You're not a farmer and certainly not a businessman. I don't know if sugar will pay or not. But, i've got something nobody else does, artesian water... and miles of land. Sooner or later, is got to be worth money. We can't see the sooner and we're not interested in the later. Take my advice, and go back to the sea. I'll see you in hell first. And be damn glad of the trip. What the matter, Micah, cat got your tongue? Pious bastards. Don't you care? Of course I do, but they're all pirates. They came here, took everything, and now, they won't part with it. I sure thought they'd fall off a few points in my direction. What will we do now? I don't know. I'll have to go back to sea, I guess. Whip, i don't want you to go. All right, I'll stay. By God, i'll stay. We'll lick them yet. I've got enough cash to plant a few acres of sugar. I can... We can mortgage the house... We could sell the house. We could sell the house and just live. We can live the way our ancestors lived. In a grass hut? On fish and poi? Yes! Listen... You didn't marry some kanaka, you married me... remember? You love me? Yes. I love you. That how it all began. I can't understand you. How could i? We haven't shared a bed for 6 months. No, Whip. Whip, please. What is it? What wrong? I don't know. I know this. If i ever needed you, is now. And all you can do is tell me to go to some beach and play dead. Nothing to worry about. Most babies get cranky sometimes. Noel was just an excuse. Is Purity i want you to see. Did you notice the way she is? Why all this Hawaiian culture? She's filled the house with this stuff. I can't get near her. Thank you. Was it having the baby? Is that what did it? It may be a post-natal depression but then again... it may not. Purity isn't just one quarter Hawaiian... she's one quarter royal Hawaiian. You know how those families have been intermarrying for years. She's losing her mind? Is possible. Yes. Here chick, chick. Come here, chicken. Here's my big fella. Wu Chow's Auntie... You did a good job nursing Noel. I've got another baby for you. What kind of baby? Pineapple, from halfway around the world, French Guiana. The French won't export any. I had a sailor friend steal this seed plant, and smuggle it out. It looks dead. Just about. Ill take a green thumb like yours. Plant them among the vegetables, and don't say a word. If you can make them grow and taste sweet... I'll smuggle out some more to plan at Hanakai. We grow. We grow. You, come with me. Maybe Captain Hoxworth will loan us money. Money? For what? Buy littee bittee land. You'll like. I know. No good buying land in this country. I want a field. Buy field in China. I want a field here. No savvy Punti! You savvy Punti yesterday. A little bit, one word. Maybe. You learn savvy Punti! Too old! Not smart. Soon my sons will begin to think they're not Chinese. In one year, we'll go back to China. One year. Where will we live in China? I'll take my sons, and live with my wife in Low Village. Where am i going to live? You'll live in your village. No! I want to buy a field here. Not buy a field. Asia! Africa! This you'll honour all your life. Your mother. Your true mother, in China. Remember? She's my wife. She looks pretty, no? Wu Chow's Auntie... I can't wait any longer on this. Les see what we've got. A little prayer to Confucius wouldn't hurt. You brought off a miracle. You grew a good pineapple. Wait. Now, you've got something coming. Shall we go look at that littee bittee land? What land? Small land up the road. The man says is 100 dollars. Captain says, i pay 20 and maybe he'll lend 80. 80, hell, this is on me. Make up your mind, do you want it? I got to get to French Guiana before I go broke in that sugar cane. Yes, i want it. Jesus shall reign... wherever the sun... does his successive... journeys run. His kingdom stretched... from shore to shore... till moons shall wax... and wane no more. People and realms... of every tongue... dwell on his love... What brings you here for the first time in your life? Business. Business? You know, we don't discuss business here. Why not? You've all got rich in the name of the Lord. I want the Carthaginian for a year. That impossible. You're as penniless as we said you'd be. Look... The will states I can sail the Carthaginian with an option to buy. I'll give up the option for the use of her. Well, brother Micah... what saith the Lord? Amen. 10.07 and twelve seconds, Mr Stein. 42 degrees, 8 minutes and 22 seconds. Right, sir. Too many dishes. Ah! You burnt! No, no. I look this hand. It no hurt? Do you have medicine for Mai Pake? Did you get the medicine? But, no like Chinese doctor. I like to see Dr Whipple. No, he'll send me to Molokai. Never, you savvy? I hear about lots of bad Chinese men. They tell police about Mai Pake. Police pay money. I think Chinese doctor and bad men are the same. What will we do when the money runs out? Kee Mun Ki. You know, i no like go back to China... but maybe is better. My Chinese wife see me as a leper? Never, never. In China ill be the same. Wu Chow's Auntie... you're a good woman. You're a good woman. Why don't we get the mosquitoes to carry the pineapples? Quiet, there may be patrol boats along here. Got him. Damn your eyes, Conroy. I said no shooting! Morris pick him up. Glendar take his place. Stand by to give way together. Oars out. All right. Work as fast as you can, but quiet. Any man comes out of there without a full sack gets left behind. Good morning. Now, is time for my preparation number 41. How much this time? Very special formula. 15 dollars. 15 dollars! I don't have 15 dollars. You have a vegetable patch. You could sell. No! I've got five sons. Patch for sons. Then, i'm afraid your friend can't be cured. No cure anyway. Medicine no good. Better i go see Dr Whipple. A white doctor? He'll sell your friend to the police. Pig! Liar! You sell to the police already. Go after her. - You know where he's staying? - No, they go, didn't say where. - Where are the kids? - Not home from school yet. - Where's Mrs Hoxworth? - She's gone. Listen... if those two Pakes come back, you tell us. Sure! Better sleep now. No, you sleep. I'm not sleepy. Funny thing. I'm sick, but I don't feel sick. Everybody's afraid of me... but, i feel the same as the day we came here. Maybe, you should be afraid too. No. Better we go. No chance unloading tonight. Don't worry about that. We'll unload the cargo ourselves. Purity! Captain, you're home. Where's Missy? Gone. I don't think she'll come back. Captain, little Pakes are in bad trouble. Come and help, please. What do we do? Help me get him in the buggy. Poor little Pakes. Kee Mun Ki. Aloha, Mun Ki. Aloha, little Pake. All kokuas aboard! All kokuas aboard! What are Kokuas? They've not got Mai Pake. Husband takes care of wife, wife takes care of husband. They stay there and don't come back. I'm a kokua. I go. I'll help Mun Ki. You got babies, Pake wahine. You take care of these babies. I take care of Mun Ki. Wu Chow's Auntie, you can't go there. Last call for kokuas! I go, i help Mun Ki. I go, please. Ready to make sail. Stand by to cast off. Kee Mun Ki. You take me with you? One more time? This time... I'll learn Punti. All right. Everybody out. Come on, lively now. Over you go. Look, i came here to see you. Purity, i want you to come home with me. But this is my home. I belong here. You belong with me. If you really mean that, stay here. By God, if i thought... Look... whatever has been wrong between us... is it over? Purity... do you want me? I don't know. By God, there's one way to find out. Whip, please put me down. Please, put me down. Please, put me down! Put me down! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're trying to trick me! All right. But, i'm taking Noel back with me. Noel belongs here with his people. These aren't his people. He's my son. Whip! Here, you take him. Captain Hoxworth! Captain Hoxworth, you got Mai Pake? No... No, by God. If i did they'd have to kill me to get me out here. What about you? She doesn't have Mai Pake yet, she's a strong woman. Mun Ki. I got your message. Captain... Better you take baby, go quick. Sorry, the baby's a girl. There's a place for girls in the world too. Is she weened? She has no name. You ask Foo Sen for a good name, please. Sure. Well... I'd better go. Good luck. Noel. Dad... Is it true you killed a man when you got the pineapples? In cold blood? Where did you hear that? School. Is it true? Yes, is true. What else do they teach you at that school? Did they tell you I found water here so they could raise the pineapples? No. They're saying the pineapples have blood on them. You don't know whether your old man is a son of a bitch, or not. Still want to go to sea? Yes, sir. All right. You'll go to sea. See what you learn there. Maybe you can figure out whether those pineapples are worth the blood. It has been long since we heard anything from them. And your sister, did you name her Mei Li as i instructed? Yes, will you tell our mother? Also tell her we're going to build a house by the vegetable patch. A house? You are ambitious. A pity your Punti is so poor. Go, go. Those aren't Chinese. Japanese. They're a lot tamer than the Chinese. Work cheaper too. Is time for you to get along. Do you need anything? I don't know, Dad. If you get in trouble just... you just get yourself out. Bye, father. What the hell's going on here? They finished it last week. A good job. On whose time, mine? No, sir. And they paid for every penny's worth of materials used. If i was you, I wouldn't put up a stink. Bathing is a kind of religion with these Japanese. Is hotter than Port Said in the summer today. Give me a hand with these. Am i supposed to give him money? He makes the soap, or his wife does. I reckon you'll be on the house. You speakie pidgin? No? No fellow speakie pidgin? My name's Fumiko. I speak. Fumiko, you don't need to speak. In Japan, I worked in a custom house. I can speak many languages. Why are you working here as a field hand? He wrote me a marriage proposal and i came. He's not a respectable man. He's very bad. You see... Hawaii's not what i thought. No work for a respectable Japanese girl, except field hand. I think maybe you can help. Help you do what? Find someone to marry you? I don't think thas much of an idea. You've got a wife already? My wife doesn't live with me. Men like you have plenty of women. That not true. Men like you don't need Fumiko. You don't know anything about a man like me. Wu Chow's Auntie. But, they said you weren't allowed to leave Molokai. Captain Hoxworth, got me out. You, Asia? No, Africa. Africa. Europe? That right. America, Australia. Where's Asia? Asia is at his restaurant. Restaurant? That good. What her name? Mei Li. The name given her by Foo Sen. Are you a leper? No, no. Do you think you can climb the ladder to your house? My house? I'll help you. Have you got Mai Pake? No. But every night i look. Now, you and me got secret, understand? Africa is smart. Much study. Better he be lawyer. But he can't be. They don't want any Chinese lawyers. Five sons. Why did Kee Mun Ki have five sons? So, the house of Kee would be big and strong. In China, big, strong family always has a lawyer. But they won't teach me here. I'd have to go to America. You go to America. But having to send money to mother in China, we could never afford it. So, we'll make more money. Restaurant too little, make it bigger. Garden too little, make it bigger. But, we haven't any more land. We get more land. I'm sorry, is impossible. Impossible come back from Molokai. Micah, what do you think of our new Queen? She's a proud, strong woman. Some think she's got herself confused with the Queen of England. Can you handle her? Or should we push someone else for Secretary of State? I doubt you'll succeed. She knows I've served three monarchs loyally. My loyalty is to my pocketbook. I hope you can protect it. Maybe this monarchy is becoming a luxury the islands can't afford. Can i give you a lift? No, thank you. I prefer to walk. To the Kee farm. I don't care if you buy it. I'll even lend you the money. The Queen won't stand for it. It belongs to a Hawaiian family. She won't let them sell their land. To white man? To anyone, except Hawaiians. Do you know this Hawaiian family? It won't do you a bit of good. I still would like to meet this Hawaiian family. Frankly, as Prime Minister you aren't worth spit in a windstorm. What were you doing when the Queen tore up our Constitution? Praying? She's given herself the power to confiscate all the land and money. I couldn't stop her. I believe is a gesture to prove her independence. Gesture! She wants every white man out of Hawaii. She's trying to drive the islands back to the 16th Century. She's trying to protect herself and her people. Can you deny that for years you've financed... a campaign to promote the American annexation of Hawaii? Why should i deny it? I'll tell you something else... for the past six months a group of us, in the family... have been buying up every firearm in Hawaii. Including some from the Queen's arsenal. For amateur revolutionaries we've done pretty well. Whip... you must wait. What for? Until we lose everything. I'll not participate in this ungodly scheme. Do you want your relatives shot for treason? No, you've got to be our white knight. I tell you, i'll not be paety to a revolution. I'll supply the revolution, you be the father of your country. Never! And i don't intend to let you drag the family down either. There's only one thing worse than a successful revolution... that an unsuccessful one. Sit tight, Brother Micah... and await your call to greatness. Is coming, believe me. Tired? Tired? Hell, no. More? I never know if you do that because you love me... because is the custom, or just to keep the furniture clean. No one ever comes here. You better see who it is. I'm Lieutenant Keholo. I know Mr Hoxworth is here. You're under arrest, sir. Am I? Whas the charge? Violation of the Defence of the Realm Act. Treason. You're taking me to jail? Yes, sir. Fumiko... you go to the American Minister... give him this. He'll know what to do. Anytime you're ready, Lieutenant. After you, sir. Hey, hold it... what are you doing here? Captain Hoxworth, you're in trouble. You'd better go or you'll be in trouble. You need money, maybe? No, thanks. I don't need money, maybe. Captain Hoxworth is an American citizen. For too long the whites have claimed any citizenship that suited them. Is particularly convenient when there happens to be... two American warships in the harbour. Apparently, you suspect some sort of conspiracy. Let me ask a hypothetical question. Suppose an uprising did occur and failed? The rebels would be beheaded. What? I'm sorry, i put it poorly. I meant a bloodless uprising. Is a custom of the islands... he who acts against the throne is beheaded. But if Americans are involved, prominent Americans. You've travelled all over, you are familiar with civilised custom. Mr Houghton, what you call civilised custom... has been more cruel to these islands than beheading greedy men. If you have any influence over them, I suggest you use it. This is all hypothetical, of course. I'm sure you intend to release Hoxworth, soon. I intend to execute him. You can't be serious! I'm sure Hoxworth is serious. Why shouldn't I be? He must have a trial. This is a government founded upon law. This is a government fighting for its life. Are you with it or against it, Mr Hale? Good evening, ma'am. We're dealing with men who hope to buy a revolution. Will they be so eager when they see it will cost them their lives? This uprising must stop. You must call it off. I'm sorry, there's nothing i can do. They've started the ball rolling. Ma'am... I still think is all talk. Let me speak to them! You have great influence with many people, so much so... they speak of you as Hawaii's first President after my fall. Without my consent. Your influence could be decisive. If is crystal clear... you stand shoulder to shoulder with me, no matter whom it hurts. This man is guilty by his own admission. Are you prepared to concur in the sentence? - Is barberous. - Not if it saves other lives. Yes or no? Time is short. Yes or no, Mr Hale? No, your Majesty. Ma'am, sailors and marines are in the city... and already in the palace grounds. As God is my witness, it was none of my doing. This is a sad day for both of us... for only God will believe you. Congratulations, Mr President. How does it feel to be the father of your country? Now, we're finally annexed and Micah is a 10,000 dollar chunk of art. The Hawaiians think he was a hell of a fellow. How many Hawaiians have forgiven you, father? Whose side are you on? Let say i think i understand your viewpoint. What was that Hoxworth and Hale sign i saw coming up from the dock? Since Micah died, your Aunt Malama and i... have gone into things together. Ignition, spark. Sounds like i've come back to a little empire. Does that scare you? It might, if i were committed to it. You've got a nice touch with that razor. Why don't you ask what a girl like me is doing here? All right. Whas a girl like you doing here? Shaving you. Is that supposed to stop me? Yes. Then how about lunch? If i can choose the restaurant. Why not? Good Lord, Mei Li. Does the whole family live here? Of course. All my brothers are married now. Why should it surprise you? I've got to agree with the Chinese... white people live and die alone. Don't forget... we're having lunch tomorrow. I won't. Pistol, we're going to be seeing a lot of each other... let go for a drink. Why not? Forgive me, but you forget how fortunate you've been... in having five sons. A daughter is a far different matter. Matter, no matter. Wong family wanted too much dowry last year... and want too much this year. Mei Li's not getting any younger. Time is on the side of the Wongs. Wongs got only two sons and one is not smart. With Mei Li they get five more sons, all smart. I say, good bargain. They're rich. They know the alliance can be of benefit to you. Together, you'll be as powerful as all the old white families. No family is rich with only two sons, and one thas not smart. They ask for ten city lots, I think they take six. They refused that last year. Seven. Seven... I will try it. Quick, he's very sick. Take him away before the police come. All right. I'll put out a couple of cases of rat poison, if you want. No! Captain Hoxworth. Put them on my desk. I'll check them later. Three cases of bubonic plague reported in Chinatown. I'm not surprised. I never saw a worse pesthole in China... and your shacks are no better than the rest. You've been seeing the pigsty the Kee family lives in... they could afford a palace. They'd have it if it weren't for the old lady. Watch what you say about that old lady. While we're on the subject, stay away from her daughter. I've seen Mei Li 12 times and I haven't been alone with her yet. What are you getting out of it? I enjoy being with her, she's whas keeping me here. What do you mean by that? I suppose I love her. All right. Live with her, but keep quiet about it. You carried her back from Molokai when she was six months old. I plan to marry her. Have a drink. No, thanks. I've never been easy on you... but there's no point making life tougher than is got to be. Have a drink. There isn't a club in this town that will let me in. I can't remember the last time I was invited into a private house. I don't give a damn, I never have. But, maybe you would. I like Mei Li, but I don't like the idea of this marriage. If they were to marry, they'll be sorry. You know all the reasons. I know reasons. I'm against it too. I can't stop it, but maybe you can. Captain Hoxworth, doesn't like the marriage either. But it was Noel who did the proposing. No Hoxworth has broken his word to us yet. He isn't even asking for a dowry. Marry Wong boy, marry whole family... Marry Hoxworth, marry one sailor. At least he speaks our language. He speaks Hakka? Only Punti. If this plague gets worse, whall happen to our business? The city lots the Wongs want are worth money... and we may need it. Now, you hear me... Captain Hoxworth is my friend, so his son is my friend... but they're white. They don't think like Chinese. They don't have 5 sons, 1 daughter, 14 grandsons, 10 granddaughters. They don't think about when they'd be married to families... that are the same one family and they spread and spread forever. That what Mun Ki and i talked about on Molokai. That what makes Mun Ki live forever. Hawaiian families understand, but white families don't. Wongs want ten lots, we pay ten lots. All of your clothes have to be burned. They're burning the house down. They found a dead man in it, they say is the plague. This place belongs to Hoxworth and Hale. Go and see Dr Whipple, he's over there. You speak their language? Tell her we need to burn everything. First, you tell me. Have you got a permit? No, but i know plague when I see it. Sue me if is your propeety but talk to her first. Don't talk to me about poison, the rats laugh at it. Our only chance is to burn the blocks down. You talk freely about burning down other people's propeety. I'm sorry, but he's right. Do you want a plague thall cover the island or to save lives? Very noble, Doctor Whipple... but not very practical. Chase the people out of here, hold them in quarantine and clean up. And in a little time, we'll get rid of the rats too. Is too late for that. By the time we cleaned up, we'd have lots more of those on our hands. Simmons, can you get fire engines in here? Some places yes, most places no. Then you risk setting the city on fire. You start anything like that, I'll get an injunction to stop you... and don't think I won't. Let me have your attention. Anyone who wishes to enter the area... must pass medical inspection. Repeat... Anyone wishing to enter must pass inspection. First tent, please. To the second tent, please. You know the quarantine hasn't worked. There are hundreds hiding in those shacks... if we wait any longer they'll all be infected. You want to burn them up? We won't burn anybody. I'm asking you to get that injunction called off. Either you get rid of it, or we'll go to the governor. What does he know about it? He's from Chicago. He never even saw Hawaii until six months ago. These islands have stayed afloat... long before your great granddaddy got here. I guess we can them from sinking under the Americans. They've provided a good way of life for you. Yes, sir. First at the expense of the Hawaiians and now the Chinese. I'm talking about the plague! What do you expect the governor to do? I'll show you. Hey... you're getting a kick out of this, aren't you? Oh, yeah. I'm having the time of my life. Is a life's work to make this island of yours fit to live in. Damn right. Left. Left. Left. Platoon, halt. Open up. - Yes? - Get your stuff out. We've to dynamite this place to clear a firebreak. - I don't understand. - The governor declared Marshall Law. You've ten minutes. Keep moving! Africa, quickly! Look out for those burning beams! Go this way. Make way for the fire wagons! We can't save it. That the end of that. Everybody move back. Chop-chop. I can't hold it anymore. The whole place is about to go. Doctor, i suppose you're happy now. Where's Wu Chow's Auntie? - The Chinese won't leave. - They're hiding everywhere. Make way for the fire wagon. I've been over half Honolulu looking for you. You've got to come to Chinatown with me. The old people won't leave, they don't know English. I only speak Hakka. At least is Chinese. She's with me. Mei Li, come with me. There's still people on the next street. Get some water, quick! She said the government will pay them. It won't. Quiet. Is no time for details. Where have you been? Looking for you. Take him, he's heavy. You stay with me. There should be 458 dollars here. And we owe 96,000. It looks like we're more than broke. Don't sell vegetable patch. I guess we were squeezing too many people in here. I have to admit it... Is better off gone. You're not broke. I'm better off than i was before. I've got cash to buy this land for what ill bring now. Dirt cheap. I guess the Chinese will hate me for that. What about you? I'll never hate you, Captain. You know, if Mei Li were to marry Noel... it may heal a lot of wounds. No good. Hoxworth up here, Kee down there. I know what you really think. Hoxworth down there, Kee up there. You know, Mei Li is supposed to marry the smart Wong boy. You never cared much for being Auntie to your own children? But, at least you had the man you wanted. Never mind, i guess you can't let her marry a white boy. I'll still let you borrow any cash you need. 96,000 dollars. 96,000 dollars? And a bit more to buy bit of land while is cheap. And Mei Li marry Noel. You know, I'm a damn lucky man. At my age i still have a goal in life... to keep you from getting my shirt. Wu Chow's father... I know you're bothered that Mei Li's marrying a white man... but remember that all the sons... have married as well as you could hope. Asia has six children. Africa, seven. Australia has five and another will come soon. Europe, remember we worried about him... he has two.
