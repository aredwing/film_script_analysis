Hardly knew her. Do not complicate things vai, vai? - What madness! - According to the certificate... You are the parent. She has to stay with you. We're on tour. This is no life for a girl. I agree. But the thing is: I called the rehab center, not find her mother. We called home and cell. The two are off. I pulled her file and saw that was arrested recently for possession of drugs. Possession of methamphetamine. The court has a warrant for her. Now... She may appear one way and give in all this. Please God yes. But none of this is good for this girl She must have other relatives. She said she did not know anyone, but we will investigate Hi Is everything okay? Was telling his friend... I'm sorry, girl. What's it called? - Iris. - Iris. - Beautiful name. - Thank you. Iris, I said to his friend Ethan that we have a problem. - What is it? - Look. - I think she is not my daughter. - If you do not stick with it... Have to call the social worker and it will go to the orphanage... And then to a foster home. But what about you? Your name is on the birth certificate. - You have a daughter? - No, no. - I have a daughter. - If I call the court now... Can not go anywhere. They will have to stay here until the hearing. And if the court order recognizing fatherhood, and they ask... And you are the parent, you're in trouble. And it will. A living hell for you. - I do not think you have a daughter. - I know it's a shock. - This is not happening. - Thinking about not stick with it? I'm thinking about what is best for Girl - I think I can not do that. - Right. You can choose. Do not need to go with it. I call the social worker... But I think I will not like. Come say "Hi, Dad."

Why canceled the tour? Let me see if I can understand why they did it . I think it was... Because of a video on You Tube that appears in fighting on stage... And abandons the two thousand fans that remained. So think... "Wait a minute. This guy is ridiculous! And there is no profit in this business and the idiots do not sell more records! That backpack may have played with Radiohead... but you can not spend money on this former someone. E was shameful! All in favor of canceling the contract with the Ethan Brand Experiment... " Fuck.
