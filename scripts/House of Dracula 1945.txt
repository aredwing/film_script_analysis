I must apologize for the intrusion, but travel for me is very difficult and I've come a long way. I don't understand. Perhaps you will after you've led me... to the basement room of this castle. It's a very strange request. This is my home. Have no fear, Doctor. Had conditions permitted, I would have presented myself in the usual manner. Well, it is most unusual. I'll explain everything before sunrise. Dr. Edelmann, do you believe in the immortality of the soul? Naturally, being a religious man. Of the body? Medical science refutes such a thing. Just as it denies the existence of vampirism. [Edelmann] It doesn't deny certain physical aspects of it. Cases have been recorded in which the victims, driven by some abnormal urge, actually believe the blood of other people was necessary to keep them alive, became psychopathic killers in order to obtain it. These beliefs probably upset their metabolisms, induced fixations, lustful appetites. The whole thing is of a highly speculative nature, particularly the supernatural aspect. Do you doubt the supernatural? I find it difficult to believe... that a human being can change himself into a bat, or that by feeding upon the blood of the living he can obtain eternal life. But what has this discussion to do with us, Baron Latos. Perhaps a great deal, Doctor. Shall we proceed? [Edelmann] The Dracula crest. Yes, Doctor, I am Count Dracula. But I'm known to the outside world as Baron Latos. You see before you a man who lived for centuries, kept alive by the blood of innocent people. You ask me to believe that? That's why I've come to you; to seek release from a curse of misery and horror... against which I am powerless to fight alone. According to the legend, a vampire must return to his grave before sunup. If you remain here, how would that be possible? Within this coffin, is a layer of soil taken from my native country. That earth makes this my grave... in which I must lie helpless during the daylight hours. Because a single ray of sunlight falling on the vampire... would destroy him. Yes, Doctor. That door was locked. How did you get that in? Since you doubt the supernatural, let us say you were mistaken. The outer door was not locked. You've taken a great deal for granted, Baron, proceeding on the assumption that I would take your case. Your reputation for helping others made me certain that you would. You could effect a cure? There might be a way, despite the dangers involved. It would be a challenge to medical science. Accept that challenge, Doctor. But decide quickly. The dawn. Good morning, Nina. Good morning, Doctor. Make a blood smear of this will you, please. A Baron Latos will be in this evening. I'll see him immediately. Well, how are things coming? Splendid, Doctor. Increasing the humidity was a good idea. The spores are multiplying faster than ever. Yes, we're making progress all right. The operation on Johannes'leg proves that. If we can produce the mold in quantity, think what it will mean to thousands of people all over the world. We'll succeed, Nina. And when we do, your devotion to this experiment will be rewarded. You'll be the first to benefit by it. Nina, make a culture of this and prepare an antitoxin as soon as possible. All right, Doctor. [Knocking] I am Baron Latos. Dr. Edelmann is expecting me. Baron Latos. Miss Morelle, what a pleasant surprise. It's good to see you again, Baron. You left Schvonheim just as we were becoming acquainted. I could hardly refuse the opportunity to become Dr. Edelmann's assistant. Now that chance has brought us together again, I hope to see you quite often. I've taken a chateau close by. You're not here as a patient. Unfortunately, the doctor thought it advisable that I come here for treatment. Good evening, Baron. Come in. Miss Morelle, it will be necessary for Baron Latos... to have his appointments during the evenings. Yes, Doctor. Sit down, Baron. Thank you. It appears that I may have to alter my theories. An examination of your blood... reveals the presence of a peculiar parasite, a form with which I'm completely unfamiliar. It's possible that it may have something to do with your, ah... problem. Proceeding on the assumption that it has, I'm having an antitoxin prepared so that we can see. Your new theory being... That a pure culture of a parasite... introduced into the parent bloodstream, will destroy, not only its own kind, but themselves as well. Sounds very promising. Perhaps. But we must proceed slowly. These treatments... will take some time? Without doubt. Meanwhile, your visits here should be only at intervals... on the nights and at the hours which I shall designate. Is that understood? Quite clearly. Then we shall start treatments tonight. The transfusion. How long will the doctor be busy? Some little time, I'm afraid. I'm must see him at once. I've come a long way. If you'll just give him my name. Talbot. Lawrence Talbot. Maybe he'll understand. I can't interrupt the doctor now. He's giving a transfusion. How long will that take? An hour. Maybe longer. I'm sorry, you'll just have to wait. I can't wait! There isn't time. There isn't time! Your next appointment will be Thursday evening, Baron. At about the same time? Yes. Good night, Doctor. Good night. [Dracula] Good night. Good night. Oh! Baron. Mr. Talbot was here to see you, Doctor. He was terribly upset. Talbot? Lawrence Talbot. He seemed to think you'd recognize the name. Lawrence Talbot... No. There was something tragic about him. He had the look of a man tormented by fear. When I told him you were busy, he rushed out of the house saying he couldn't wait. There wasn't time. Well, perhaps he'll come back. [Ringing] Hello. Just a moment, please. It's Inspector Holtz. Yes, Inspector? Oh? Very well, I'll be right down. You'd better come along with me, Miliza. Go to your homes, all of you. This is no concern of yours. We don't have to go home. We know our rights. That goes for you too, Steinmuhl. Whenever there's trouble, you're always on the front line. Good evening, Doctor. Come right in, will you, please. Go home! If I find the person... who started the rumor we have a crazy man here, I'll lock him up. As a matter of fact, Doctor, we have. He came in here a little while ago and demanded that I put him in a cell, to keep him from committing murder, he said. I did it to humor him. But when he started raving, I realized we had something serious and sent for you. Decent chap otherwise. Name ofTalbot. Talbot? You remember, Doctor. The man I told you about. Come in, Doctor. He's in here. Who are these people? Get them out of here! I didn't come here to be put on exhibition. Come, come now. Take it easy. This is Dr. Edelmann. He's come to help you. Dr. Edelmann! Yes. You wanted to see me? That's why I came to Visaria. In the hope that you could help me. It's too late now. What seems to be your trouble, my boy? Do you believe that a man can be transformed into an animal? [Edelmann] I believe anything can happen in a person's mind. [Talbot] This is not in my mind. Doctor, have you ever heard of the pentagram? Five-pointed star. The mark of the beast. When the full moon rises, I turn into a werewolf... with only one desire in my mind... to kill! Listen to me, Talbot. There's no such thing as a werewolf. It's a belief that exists only in your mind. [Growling] Doctor, isn't there something you can do? Not until morning, when this passes. Bring him to me then. Put him in my care, and I'll do all I can for him. Oh, I didn't hear you. The doctor will see you now. Do you think he can help me? He's done some wonderful things. Then why has he kept me waiting here all day? Doesn't he realize that tonight... I'm sorry. I know he'll do whatever he can for me. Good afternoon, Doctor. Sit down, Mr. Talbot. What have you got to tell me? In your case, my boy, diagnosis is extremely difficult. But the examination you made this morning, the X-rays. The examination discloses one condition, pressure upon certain parts of the brain. This condition coupled with your belief... that the moon can bring about a change... accomplishes exactly that. During the period in which your reasoning processes give way to self-hypnosis, the glands which govern your metabolism get out of control, like a steam engine without a balance wheel. When this happens, the glands generate an abnormal supply of certain hormones. In your case, those which bring about the physical transformation you experience. But explaining it doesn't help. What can you do about it, operate? A surgical operation to enlarge the cranial cavity is a long and dangerous one. Then there's nothing you can do to help me. There might be. Come here, my boy. Under tropical conditions, which we have tried to duplicate here, this hybrid plant, clavaria formosa, produces a mold which we've been able to distill... Well, a substance which possesses the property... of softening any hard structure composed of calcium salts. Bone, for instance. With this medium, it might be possible, without surgery, to reshape the cranial cavity and thus eliminate the pressure. You can do that now? Can you? Unfortunately, it will take some time to produce mold in sufficient quantity. [Talbot] Tonight the moon will be full again. What can you do to help me now? Only what you did for yourself last night. Confine you. No, Doctor. No. I can't go through that again. [Edelmann] Talbot, listen. Talbot. Talbot! Talbot, come back! [Edelmann] Seigfried! Seigfried! There are many caves along the coastline here made by the tides. There's still a chance that he can be saved. We must think of the danger to Dr. Edelmann. If Mr. Talbot has been swept into the cave down there, he's still under the spell of the moon. We must wait 'til it sets. When it does, if he's still alive, he'll try to destroy himself again. That's why the doctor must time his actions to the very moment. If he can find him just as the seizure passes, and his reason returns... Perhaps he can persuade him to want to live. Here we work half a night to get this thing rigged up... and then he says, "We'll wait a while." What's going on around here anyway? Shh, that's Dr. Edelmann's business. Strange business, if you ask me. Shh! All right, swing me out. Lower away. Easy. All right! I might've killed you. Why did you follow me down here? To bring you back, my boy. Back to a life of misery and despair? I only wanted to die. You wanted to die, but instead you will live... 'cause God in his divine workings... has lead you to the very thing which makes help possible. Look about you. The temperature and humidity down here are ideal... for growing the spore-producing plants. Before the next full moon, we should have more than enough to help you. I wish I could believe that, Doctor. You can, my boy. But you must do your part. You must want to live. The Frankenstein monster. That must be the skeleton of Dr. Niemann... who revitalized him years ago. As the story goes, the villagers drove them into the swamp... and they went down in the quicksand. After all these years, the mud has brought them here. He's still alive. He's indestructible. Frankenstein's creation is man's challenge to the laws of life and death. Doctor! Dr. Edelmann! Doctor, look here. There must be a way out of here into the castle. [Edelmann] History mentions an old torture chamber. But its entrance was sealed up years ago. [Edelmann] He was made bit by bit, piece by piece. The undying monster. The triumphant climax of Frankenstein's genius. The heart that Frankenstein gave him never died. The spark of life is still there waiting to be revived. Dr. Edelmann, this thing destroyed Frankenstein. It's brought death to all who have tried to follow in his footsteps. Is that poor creature responsible for what he is? It's a thing of violence to whom death would be a merciful release. Can man sit in judgment over life and death? The evil he creates, he can also destroy. That would be murder. Think what you're doing, Doctor. To bring him back again would unleash worse than murder upon humanity. That helpless body is man's responsibility. Man's responsibility is to his fellow man. Perhaps you're right, Nina. Frankenstein's monster must never wreak havoc again. ##["Moonlight Sonata"] ## Baron. I didn't hear you come in. Please go on. ## You like it? It breathes the spirit of the night. They played it the evening we met at the concert. I'd forgotten... until I saw you again. Perhaps I wanted you to remember. ## ##[Haunting Music] I've never heard this music before, yet I'm playing it. You're creating it... for me. It frightens me. It's beautiful. It's the music of the world from which I come. It makes me see strange things. People who are dead, yet they're alive. Mine is a world without material needs. It calls to me, but I'm afraid. The fear will pass as the music becomes fixed in your mind. It will make you long to be there. ##[Peaceful Music] ##["Moonlight Sonata"] Why do you stop? Play the music again. There's something Dr. Edelmann... told me to do. Roll up your sleeve, please, Baron. The music will come to you again. My world is waiting for you. Forsake the cross so that you can join me there. Your world is coming closer to me. But I'm afraid. It is a world without fear. It is like the music. Beautiful. Beautiful. Oh, good evening, Baron. Thank you, Miliza. That'll be all. I feel that we're making progress, Baron. This photomicrograph of your blood reveals an odd condition, one which I can't account for as yet. What is it? A different species of antibodies has appeared. Why worry so long as the treatments are proving successful? If a doctor effects a cure, he wants to know how he did it... Which is of little concern to the patient so long as he's being cured. Day after tomorrow? At the same time. Then good night, Doctor. Please go to bed, Miliza. I'll finish down here. I think I will. Miliza! Miliza! Are you all right? The music is bringing my world closer, closer. Doctor, Baron Latos... he left here early this evening, didn't he? About half past eight. Why? L... l... Miliza and I were working. What are you trying to tell me? She seemed awfully tired... like a person in a trance. In a trance? She left me without saying a word. I followed her. She met Baron Latos in the hall. They went into the garden. And when he walked in front of the mirror, I couldn't see his reflection. I imagined that, didn't I? Didn't I? No, Nina. Baron Latos shows no reflection. Then he... He's Count Dracula. In trying to save him, I've endangered the lives of all of you. Then cast away the cross so that you may join me there. I must try to stop him before it's too late. But how? Prepare for a transfusion at once. You can't give another one so soon. Do as I tell you. If anything should happen to me tonight, go to the armor room in the basement and burn what you find. What is it, Doctor? You'll understand. You must destroy it by fire. Go to your room. When you hear the music, I will come to you. I've been looking for you, Baron. You remember that I was puzzled tonight by the new antibodies? Yes. I know now where they came from. They're from my blood. We may be on the verge of an important discovery. So to check my theory, I'm going to give you another transfusion. Now? Lmmediately. If this is the answer, we must see. Doctor. Dr. Edelmann! Doctor! Dr. Edelmann! He's gone. Mr. Talbot! Mr. Talbot! [Footsteps] Miliza. She's all right now. But what about him? The evil I brought here will never live again. [Electricity Crackling] They tried to kill you, but they couldn't. Frankenstein gave you eternal life, power which time cannot destroy, the secret of immortality which will soon be mine. [Electricity Crackling] [Electricity Stops] Dr. Edelmann? Go away. Leave me alone. Dr. Edelmann, I have some coffee for you. Go away, I tell you. Dr. Edelmann, let me in! Doctor. Doctor, you're ill. No. I'm all right. That'll make you feel better. How much of the spore concentrate have we ready? Don't worry about that now. We're making fine progress. Answer me. Is there enough for two operations? No, there won't be for some time. But we do have enough for one? I think so. Then I must operate as soon as possible, on you. But doctor... You were right, Nina. I am ill. It's impossible to know what the future holds. Oh, there, there, Doctor. You mustn't talk like that. I'll operate tomorrow, Nina. Then you must operate on Mr. Talbot. The moon will be full in a few days. We can't let him suffer again. But you... You've waited such a long time. Then I can wait a little longer. It won't make any difference. You're worn out. Why don't you get some rest? I'm all right. I know who you're thinking of. I'm hoping we'll be ready in time. I can't stand the thought of him having to go through that again. Don't worry, we'll have enough. Why, it's wonderful, Dr. Edelmann. What you've done would ordinarily mean an operation of the most delicate nature. This way the dangers of surgery didn't even exist. We can expect some nervous shock. He must be kept quiet. Any exertion might undo everything I hope we've accomplished. We'll know in a few days, Miliza. All we can do now is hope. And pray. We must think now only of Nina. Every minute must be devoted to producing... more of the concentrate for her. You're a fine nurse, Miliza. You know perfectly well Mr. Talbot should be asleep by now. Sleep? I'll have a lifetime in which to sleep, when I know what lies ahead. After what Dr. Edelmann has done for you, only happiness lies ahead. I wonder. Please don't think that I'm ungrateful. Time after time people have tried to help me. Time after time they've failed. If this fails... It won't fail, Larry. You must believe that it won't. I've tried to, but when I face the night... Try to see the night as something beautiful. Until the full moon turns it into a thing of ugliness and horror. Soon you'll see it as everyone else does. Restful, tranquil and serene. Until that time comes, I'll live a thousand hopes, die a thousand times. It will never be ugly to you again, Larry. Believe me, I know it. How do you know that? My heart tells me. Hello, Seigfried. Dr. Edelmann! Did you hear me call to you, Seigfried? Why no, sir. I would have stopped for you if I had. I'm certain you would have. Don't worry about it, Seigfried. What's the matter, Seigfried? You act as though you were afraid. Oh, no, sir. Why should I be afraid? Of the night, perhaps. I'm not afraid of the night. Your hands are trembling, Seigfried. Are they? Seigfried. Yes, sir? I believe I know what you're afraid of. Do you? You're afraid of me. Of you, sir? 'Cause if you weren't, you'd look at me, Seigfried. Ya! Ya! See, you are afraid of me. You're driving faster so that you can get into the village and tell the police. Why should I want to tell the police anything? Because you're afraid I'm going to kill you. Kill me? Doctor! Yes. You've seen what's happened to your old friend. He doesn't want anybody but himself to know about that. No, Doctor! I will never tell! That's right, Seigfried. You never will! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! There he is! There he is! This way! It's your brother Seigfried. Is he dead? There he goes! [Knocking] Good evening, Inspector. Sorry to disturb you, Doctor, but I'd like to see... Mr. Talbot and everybody else in the house at once. Certainly. Is something wrong? You'll know in good time, Doctor. Now please hurry. Now, Inspector, what is it? Your man Seigfried's been murdered. Seigfried? Murdered? By the person who rode into the village with him tonight. His throat was torn open as though by some enraged animal. So naturally you suspect me. I have good reason to. But he hasn't been out of the house for days. Not to your knowledge. Have you been with him all evening? Until an hour ago. But the murder was only committed 20 minutes ago. And within the last 5 minutes, we pursued the murderer to these very grounds. But it's impossible. Only the full moon affects Mr. Talbot. The moon won't be full again until tomorrow night. Not only that, but Mr. Talbot has undergone an operation... which makes physical exertion out of the question. Running a short distance, much less from the village, would cause serious complications. A cerebral hemorrhage, perhaps even his death. I respect your word, but a murder has been committed. It's imperative that I search your premises immediately. He's the man you want. Are you gonna let Dr. Edelmann talk you out of it? That's enough, Steinmuhl. That's enough. I apologize, Doctor, but the man who killed his brother is somewhere around here. It's my duty to find him. I shall hold you responsible for these people until further notice. [Knocking] Yes? What are you doing here, my boy? You shouldn't be up. Never mind me, Doctor. It's you I'm worried about. You were with Seigfried tonight when he went to the village. I saw you. I saw you when you came back. Why didn't you tell Inspector Holtz? After what you've done for me? Why, you tried to help me. And you want to help me now? If I possibly can. Because you suffered the tortures I'm going through now, you of all people will understand what I'm going to say. In trying to perform the miracle of medical science, I failed. My blood has been contaminated... by the blood of Dracula. My soul and mind have been seized by some nameless horror, a lust which changes me into the thing that killed Seigfried tonight. If you wish to help me, there's one way in which you can. Say nothing to Inspector Holtz of what you know. Not to protect me, but to give me time. Time to do for Nina what I've done for you. After that, this evil thing must be destroyed. You have my word that it will be, my boy. But if I am unable, you must do it for me. Dr. Franz Edelmann. Bonn University, cum laude. What's going on here? I was just on my way over to your office, Inspector. I want you to take a look at this. I found it clenched in Seigfried's left hand. Dr. Edelmann killed him. Be quiet, Steinmuhl. You don't know what this means. Neither do I. It's obviously a matter for the police to handle. Is that clear? It's clear Dr. Edelmann killed my brother. Last night you thought it was Talbot. Tonight you say it's a man we've known and respected for years. You're worse than a gossiping old woman. Go home! Go home, all of you. I'm sick and tired of this. Come on, break it up. [Steinmuhl] Something's going on at Dr. Edelmann's, I tell you. What does Holtz have to say about it? [As Holtz] This is a matter for the police to handle. It's a matter for us to handle... unless we all want to be murdered. He's right. I'm for doing something about it. Well, I don't know now. I'm with you. The next few moments will give us our answer. It's the time we've all been looking forward to. You must put fear out of your mind. Confront it with a belief that the past is over with, that a new life lies ahead. A new life. Stay here, please. All of you. But, Larry... No! Not until we can be sure. Oh, Doctor, it's wonderful. Dr. Edelmann? Doctor! [Electricity Crackling] That's it. That's it. Now! Now! That's it. That's it! I'll make you strong, stronger than you've ever been. I'll give you the strength of a hundred men. No, Dr. Edelmann. No! You promised. What are you doing here? Why, l... You were spying on me, weren't you? No, I just wanted to find you. I wanted to tell you that l... You shouldn't have done that, Nina. I want to see Dr. Edelmann at once. You shouldn't have come here. I don't like people who see what they're not supposed to see. Aaah! Doctor! [Miliza] He's gone mad. Hello, Mr. Talbot. You broke your promise to me, didn't you? You told the police. I don't like people who break their promises, Mr. Talbot. Get out! The Frankenstein monster!
