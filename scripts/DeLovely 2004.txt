Though, under the circumstances, l suppose l should say my prayers. Why start now? Exactly. lf l believed in God, he would be a song-and-dance man. He would have to carry a tune. Preferably one of mine. Do you think he would like this? In the still of the night As I gaze from my window At the moon in its flight My thoughts all stray to you You wrote that about Linda, of course. Did l? Songs don't have to be about someone, you know. We should start. l thought we had. Cole, you have to play us into it. lt's your life. Your music will be our guide. Swell. In the still of the night As I gaze from my window Oh, my God, that's me! l'm so young. You satisfied? He's very good. He's not much of a singer. You never were. In the still of the night The words, l can't hear the words. While the world is in slumber What's the matter, can't he take direction? Cole, talk to me, l'll pass your thoughts along. He can't hear you. ln a musical, everyone works for the composer. Times have changed. May l borrow this? Times have changed Never open with a ballad. This isn't one of those avant-garde things, is it? lt's got to be entertaining, it's a musical. And a love story, of course. A little unconventional, but honest. You're playing with my life. lt's my show. Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock Plymouth Rock would land on them In olden days lt's your life, Cole. Was looked on something shocking Oh, my God. lt's an opening number, of course. lt's the Berlins. lrving, Ellin. lrving gave me my start. This is my whole life. There's Monty Woolley from Yale. Look at Monty. That costume is all wrong. He never wore that. That's all wrong. Change it. And black's white today And day's night today L. B. Mayer and the gang from MGM. The Hollywood years. When folks who still can ride in jitneys found out that Vanderbilts and Whitneys lack baby clothes Anything goes Boris and Jack. Bill Wrather. Gerald, Sara, Honoria, where are the boys? Boys. Anything goes Hi, Mom. And every night, the set that's smart is intruding on nudist parties in studios Anything goes Fantastic. So though I'm not a great romancer I know that you're bound to answer when I propose Anything goes If saying your prayers you like, if green pears you like If old chairs you like, if backstairs you like, If love affairs you like Stop, this is wrong for Linda. She should sing a different part, stop. ls it me? No, dear. lt's backstairs and love affairs. lt's too early for complications. We're gonna get ready for Paris. lf you're not in Paris, l'll see you later. Come on, move along. You're doing beautifully. But then, you always do. Remember, it's your story, too. lt's a love story. -That's why l'm frightened. -Don't be. Have you ever seen a musical without a happy ending? All right, then. We've just heard Anything Goes... as if it's Cole's declaration of independence. lndependence from whom? Never mind. Don't argue with the director, love. Leave that to me. He's very strict. She can't hear you. l know. You're seeing Cole for the first time. You start to move towards him... because there's a spirit in his eye. Go ahead. Move slowly. You'll be fine. Weren't we fools to lose each other? Weren't we fools to say goodbye? God, she was beautiful. She could stop your heart. No, start it. You chose another So did I If we'd realized our love was worth defending Then the story's broken threads we might be mending They're so good, it's a shame more people aren't paying attention. Cole can take care of that. Which one is Cole Porter? The one who's standing, who's being so serious about being playful... that's my husband Gerald. And the one who's playing at not being serious at all, that's Cole Porter. -Has somebody died? -l think it was us, Cole. -Linda Lee. -Sara Murphy. -We met at Lady Mendel's. -Yes, indeed. ls that Linda Lee Thomas with Sara? -l really couldn't say. -No, it is, and just as they described her: The most beautiful divorce in Paris. My God, she's ravishing. ls this gonna be another Porter fascination? An obsession without preliminaries? Obsessions don't have preliminaries. -Will you join me? -l'm a married man. No, come on grab a chair. Let's really light a fire under these deadbeats. You begin. I have heard, among this clan You are called ''the forgotten man'' Well, did you ever? What a swell party this is Have you heard that Mimsie Starr just got pinched in the Astor Bar? Well, did you ever? What a swell party this is Take over. -You're not gonna pinch her in the ass? -l might. Reggie's rather scatterbrained He dove in when the pool was drained Well, did you ever? What a swell party this is It's great, it's grand It's wonderland It's tops, it's first It's DuPont, it's Hearst What clothes, quel chic What pearls, they're the peak What glamor, what cheer This will simply slay you, dear Have you heard the coast of Maine just got hit by a hurricane? Well, did you ever? What a swell party this is Have you heard that poor dear Blanche Got run down by an avalanche? Well, did you ever? What a swell party this is What daiquiris What sherry, please What burgundy What great Pommery What brandy, wow What whiskey, here's how What gin and what beer Will you sober up, my dear? Have you heard, Professor Munch ate his wife and divorced his lunch? Well, did you ever? What a swell party this is Have you heard, it's in the stars Next July, we collide with Mars? Well, did you ever? What a swell party a swell party, a swellegant, elegant party this is! God, we're a hit! Now we have a party. -Shall we? -Yes, let's. My God. Grace personified. Was that me? Did l sweep you off your feet? Because l hadn't intended to do that for quite a while. You really are smooth, aren't you, Mr. Porter? Never till now, Mrs. Thomas. Your song was absolutely delirious. Thank you. l'm never sure if they get the joke. -Especially when it's on them. -Learn to trust your audience. l trust it, l just wish l could expand it. He seems a bit calculating, don't you think? -Weren't you? -Not entirely. l said l was ambitious, but l was anything but an opportunist. After all, l spent 10 years in Paris... just having fun. What are we talking here, a love affair? A business proposition... or a social arrangement? There was nothing arranged... or negotiated about our relationship. lt was... our own. What about these gloves? ls it really true... that you only wear them once and then you discard them? Yes. To where do you discard them when you're finished? l send them to a cousin in Louisville. Not this one, all right? Let me keep this. Look at that hand. You should never cover your hands, they're beautiful. -They're ungainly. -No, they're strong. No one's ever thought of me as strong before. l think of you as strong and down to earth... -and solid. l think of you in many ways. -You're sweet. lsn't that Diaghilev and his boy from the Ballets Russes? That's his premier danseur. -Would you like to meet them? -Don't know, would l? Perhaps another time. Bonjour. He is an acquaintance from yesterday. An unmanned piano. Come on. I know you hate to hear That I adore you, dear Not you, dear. But grant me, just the same I'm not entirely to blame For you'd be so easy to love Christ, that cue is as loud as my whistle. And it's too early for another song. lf you can say it better than you write it, fine. Otherwise, Cole sings. All right. The yearning for So swell to keep every home fire Thank you. Burning for We'd be so grand at the game So carefree together that it does seem a shame If you can't see Your future with me 'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love Dear Cole. You have so much nerve, Mr. Porter. God, l'd be frightened. l'm just showing off. There are much worse things to be afraid of. You have a dazzling gift and a life to go with it. What could you possibly be afraid of? Myself. l'm not afraid of that. l hope you never will be. Even when you really get to know me. We'd be so grand at the game So carefree together that it does seem a shame If you can't see Your future with me 'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love l thought you would be tired of your apartment. You're gonna have to help me out here. l mean, if this is really you. Why? This is how it was. This is how l was. l wanted every kind of love that was available. I could never find them in the same person. Or the same sex. l've never had the urge to be completely honest with anyone until you. lt's quite disturbing. Especially since l haven't been totally honest. You knew so much about me when we met, Cole... don't you think l'd heard a thing or two about you? Then you know about.... Well, that l can be.... That l have... other interests. lnterests, the pursuit of which some people might find cruel to you. You mean men? Yes, men. Let's just say you like them more than l do. Nothing is cruel that fulfills your promise. l've been promising all my life. l've got a notebook full of promise. Trunks full. l want to be more than promising to you. We could fulfill your promise together. We could be singular as a couple. Would you stay for dinner? lt will be just us. l'd like that. So, did you love her then? Then? I don't know. I thought I might discover what love was. The physical side was always.... We could take it or leave it. It was pleasant enough. But the intimacy was stunning. Good morning. What's that? lt's an idea for a song. This part, right here, l think would go nicely with... ''l love you.'' What do you think? l think that would be beautiful. l do, you know. You don't have to love me the way that l love you, Cole. Just love me. lt's so easy. This verse you've started seems to me The Tin Pan-tithesis of melody So to spare you all the pain Monty. l almost didn't recognize you under all that hair. We've all matured since school, Coley. At Yale, the only grooms that interested you were in the stables. Monty, behave yourself. This is the happiest day of my life. The night is young, the skies are clear So if you wanna go walking, dear Along with the bluebird, dogwood is the great harbinger of the Kentucky spring. -They're beautiful. -Thank you. l'm ready. Ma'am. Where is he? You might prefer privacy. l would not. To holy matrimony, then. And whatever further perforations you may put in it. -Excuse me. -What? Sorry, Monty. lt's good to see you again, Mrs. Thomas. -lt's Mrs. Porter. -Not yet. Don't blame poor Cody... he was only doing what l told him. My name never suited? Thomas not proper enough? lt's another name for ''shame.'' So now you're all snug and proper, are you? Marrying this fawn? Why are you here, Edward? There's a certain section of the bar here. The left side, l think, significantly enough... where your groom and his gentleman friends like to call on each other. l assumed, for symbolic purposes at least... that the wedding would be held there. l had to assume, you see... since my invitation never arrived. -l would invite you to hell. -No need. Already there. Too bad you never cared for it. ln spite of caring for you once-- My fault, then. You offered care, l needed passion. What does the fawn need? Can you supply him? Surely not with everything. And what can he give you? Pride. Don't turn your back on me, Mrs. Thomas. That's so funny. From what l remember, it was the position you most favored. -Are you all right? -l'm fine. Wait. Mr. Thomas, you have the most peculiar sense of timing. You think you can make her happy because you won't violate her delicacy? Because you don't need her as a woman? l think maybe we define ''woman'' differently. l don't define it as ''punching bag,'' for instance. Cole's not like you. He creates, you destroy. And as you can see, you're a failure even at that. Let's get married. See the crowd in that church See the proud parson plopped on his perch Get the sweet beat of that organ sealing our doom Here goes the groom, boom! How they cheer and how they smile As we go galloping down the aisle It's divine, dear, it's diveen, dear It's de-wunderbar, it's de-victory It's de-vallop, it's de-vinner It's de-voiks -Mrs. Murphy? -Absolutely. The knot is tied and so we take A few hours off to eat wedding cake It's delightful, it's delicious It's de-lovely It feels so fine -Thank you, dearest. -For what? For all of this, for our future. For being with me just now with Edward. That was nothing. That was pest control, that's all. To the pop of champagne Off we hop in our plush little plane Till a bright light through the darkness They seem so happy. Let's hope he doesn't misbehave. Our day's complete And what a beautiful bridal suite It's dreamy, it's drowsy It's de-reverie, it's de-rhapsody It's de-regal, it's de-royal It's de-Ritz, it's de-lovely We settle down as man and wife To solve the riddle called married life It's delightful It's delicious Now you love her, yes? l said the words. l meant them. l wanted to mean them. God knows l wrote them often enough. And even more after we were married. Maybe that says something. They did always sound better with music under them. God, she was beautiful. Venice. We had such parties. We had a floating dance floor on the Grand Canal. You know that Robert Browning once lived in that palazzo? He got a lot more written than I did, but he didn't have half the fun. There they are. Hello, Berlins. Welcome to Palazzo Rezzonico. I got so out of hand that finally Linda had to bring in reinforcements. And being Linda, she brought the best. She single-handedly orchestrated my reformation. l have to say, the music is not bad, either. -ls that Cole? -Yes, it is. This funny thing called love Just who can solve its mystery? Cole? You're lrving Berlin. -Am l interrupting? -No, l mean, yes. But it's an honor to be interrupted by America's greatest songwriter. -What a pleasure. -The most publicized, that's for sure. And rightfully so. Linda has told us so much about you, she's left out the most important stuff. -What would that be? -Your songs. l heard about them, but l've never actually heard one played before. You were listening to that? That's a bit daunting. l need a drink. Can l offer you something? No, it's okay. l'm gonna let you get back to your work. l'd love to hear the tune when it's done. lt's a real pleasure. A real pleasure. -Pleasure's mine, welcome to Venice. -Thank you very much. -We'll have some fun later. -l look forward to that, Cole. I was a humdrum person Leading a life apart When love flew in through my window wide And quickened my humdrum heart Love flew in through my window I was so happy then But after love had stayed a little while Love flew out again What is this thing called love? This funny thing called love? Just who can solve its mystery? Why should it make a fool of me? I saw you there one wonderful day You took my heart and threw it away That's why I ask the Lord in heaven above What is this thing called love? What is this thing called love? This funny thing called love? Just who can solve its mystery? Why should it make a fool of me? I saw you there one wonderful day You took my heart and threw it away That's why I ask the Lord in heaven above What is this thing called love? Bravo, Cole. You know, Cole, you're spoiling us. And, excuse me, you're pampering yourself. You have far too much talent to waste as an amateur. And we must do something about that. l think it may be the most beautiful love song you've written yet. Why, thank you. There's quite a bit of you in it. What do you think you'll call it? l don't know, something about confusion. Dinner is served. Yes, let's eat. Thank you for your indulgence. That was the truth, for the most part. There was a lot of Linda in that song. I wish there could have been more. We are leaving soon, you know. The tour begins. l heard. l don't like it one bit. l don't know what l'm going to do without you. Of course, you know... it is only a European tour... and l can travel. l could mysteriously appear in certain European cities from time to time. But you are a married man. What about Mrs. Porter? Boris, l've told you... Mrs. Porter... tries very hard to want what l want. Surely not everything. Whatever l need. As long as she knows the rest belongs to her. And what is the rest? Everything that happens in the daylight. Which is why l have to go. -l'll see you there? -Of course. You could have a great career And you should, yes, you should Only one thing stops you, dear You're too good, way too good If you want a future, darling, why don't you get a past? 'Cause that fatal moment's coming at last We're all alone, no chaperone Can get our number The world's in slumber Let's misbehave There's something wild about you, child It's so contagious Let's be outrageous Let's misbehave When Adam won Eve's hand He wouldn't stand for teasing He didn't care about those apples out of season They say that spring means just one thing To little lovebirds We're not above birds, let's misbehave l'm being hailed. lt's from lrving. lrving? -You knew. -l had hoped. No, you knew. Okay, l didn't know what the show was to be called. lt's to be called Paris. And lrving has assured the producer... that l'm the only one with the suitable sophistication... to do the show. So it seems that we would be leaving Venice... to go to New York to do a show called Paris. We'll go, won't we? Darling, what do you think? l know you would like to. You orchestrated the whole thing, you willed it into being. l'm just not sure l'm ready. Cole, l promise you, you are ready. lrving Berlin believes in your talent. He wouldn't recommend you simply out of friendship. No, l suppose not. Cole, it will be a wonderful chance for you, and a good change for us. Yes. Yes, we'll go? Yes, it will be a big change. l think we need a change. l never intended this to cause a breach between us. lt hasn't, it just.... Cole, we never had a formal agreement, we don't need one now. lt's done. l can't promise you that. Just so it doesn't put us in jeopardy. Or your music. You really love me that much? You are the rhythm of my heart. They're playing your song. Would you care to dance? Why not? They say that bears have love affairs And even camels We're merely mammals, let's misbehave See, true love. l'm not so sure about true. Linda played that beautifully. l think that's when l began to really love her. All right, Linda, Cole, smile if you're in love, please. Didn't that make things even more complicated? -What things? -Your other relationships. No, why should it? Isn't that why birds do it, bees do it? Even educated fleas do it Let's do it Let's fall in love In Spain, the best upper sets do it Lithuanians and Letts do it Let's do it Let's fall in love The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it Not to mention the Finns Welcome, sir. Folks in Siam do it Think of Siamese twins Say hello to Mrs. Porter. Richard, would you please take my hat? People say in Boston, even beans do it Let's do it, let's fall in love Cold Cape Cod clams against their wish, do it Even lazy jellyfish do it Let's do it, let's fall in love Electric eels, I might add, do it Though it shocks them, I know Why ask if shad do it? Waiter, bring me shad roe In shallow shoals, English soles do it Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it Let's do it Let's fall in love The dragonflies in the reeds do it Sentimental centipedes do it Let's do it Let's fall in love Mosquitoes, heaven forbid, do it So does every katydid do it Let's do it Let's fall in love The most refined ladybugs do it When a gentlemen calls Moths in your rugs do it What's the use of mothballs? Locusts in trees do it Bees do it Even overeducated fleas do it Let's do it, let's fall in love Let's do it, let's fall in love Let's do it, let's fall in love Very cheeky. Excellent. -That's so far. -Listen to them. One act down, one to go. Darling, for you. God, Linda. Exquisite. Just a little memory. There are no little memories with you. Patrick, you all right? ls he all right doing that? His doctors approve? Probably not, but he's got to have a childhood. His sickness seems to come and go. Patrick, let me give you the key to the cartwheel. lt's all mental. Keep your arms straight. Here comes trouble. You plant it, watch this, ready? And plant it like that. See? Good catch. l always thought so. Sun-tanned, wind-blown Honeymooners at last alone -You know, this was written as a duet. -Thanks. Oh, how lucky we are While I give to you and you give to me True love, true love So on and on it will always be True love, true love Cole, l know this is your song, but it just doesn't sound like you. Linda thinks it does. With nothing to do Are you going to put it in the new show you're working on? -Why not? -Because it doesn't sound like me. Love forever true Bravo! Oh, my goodness, could you be any more wonderful? Come in. -Hello. -Hi. l was lying in my bed just now, thinking... l don't want to stay in that room. l want to stay here tonight, is that all right? Of course it is, darling. ls everything all right? Are you lonely? No, l'm fine. lt's just that.... lt's funny, this afternoon... l was watching you... and watching you watching the Murphys' kids... and l thought about how happy we are and how much we have... and then l thought about the Murphys and how happy they are... and l think we could be.... We are as happy as the Murphys, but we could be happy in the way that... the Murphys are happy if we had what the Murphys have. They bring them so much happiness. l'm so glad l'm not trying to write this as a song. lt would be a beautiful serenade. Champagne, or how do you wanna play this? Comedy, tragedy? Musical comedy, farce? Why don't we just play? Good idea. Night and day You are the one Only you beneath the moon And under the sun Whether near to me or far It's no matter, darling, where you are I think-- Stop! -lt's impossible, l just can't do it. -Cole. He is only an actor, but he's still maybe right. He's tried it seven times. The song is a problem. l told you, we should have given it to Astaire. Beard, the song is not a problem, it's a challenge. Just give me a moment. Jack, dear boy... what can l do to help? Anything, just name it. Write another song. God, that cuts me right to the quick. l know it's God-awful, but it's the best l can do. And we open in three days. Look, Mr. Porter, the song goes so high and so low, it is impossible. lt's not impossible. Jack, l wrote it with you in mind. l know you've got it. l can sing it, and l have a range of three notes. Where did you come up with it? l get all my ideas from a little Chinese man in Poughkeepsie. Listen, you can sing this. The problem is, you're not having any fun. Just don't think about the melody. Just think about the words. lt's about obsession. lt's about being in love. You've been in love? All right, obsess about it. Just sing it with me. Think about the lyrics and just look at me. One more time. Jimmy? Like the beat beat beat of the tom tom When the jungle shadows fall Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock -As it stands against the wall -lt's relentless, it's obsessive. Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops When the summer shower is through So a voice within me keeps repeating You you you Night and day You are the one Only you beneath the moon And under the sun That's beautiful. Whether near to me or far It's no matter, darling, where you are I think of you Night and day Jimmy, try E flat. Day and night Why is it so That this longing for you Follows wherever I go? In the roaring traffic's boom In the silence of my lonely room I think of you Night and day Night and day Under the hide of me There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning Burning inside of me And this torment won't be through Till you let me spend my life Making love to you Day and night Night and day Bravo. I never believed in anything, least of all myself, until Linda. She restored me to myself. And l gave her back... me. Hardly payment in kind. lrving swears that The Times critic was dancing up the aisle. Our producer was still standing in the front row, applauding. No triumph complete without this. Thank you. You're welcome. Let's not be late. l'm gonna ride with Monty if it's all right with you. He says the London producers are dying to talk to me... about the West End transfer. ls it all right if l join you later? Can't you speak with him at the party? No business at the party, only fun. -lt's all right, l'll be there soon. -All right. Bye-bye. Beard, you know, you're very dear to me, always have been... but these opening night gifts of yours are becoming more and more intricate. lt's not as elegant as one of Linda's cigarette cases, l know... but l believe it may be better suited to the daring side of your nature. Monty, you've always been so solicitous vis--vis my nature. You pamper me. l have to, my boy. Nature is a nasty bitch. lf nature were fair, l'd be Marlene Dietrich. If you wake up and dream Life will suddenly seem as gay as it used to be Never mind what they say Let your dreams dream away And you'll still be alive when they're dead Your words. Yes, Monty, but it's a song, not a call to arms. Arms weren't what l had in mind. l wanted to tell you privately how much all your attention did for me. And Night and Day, how much it means to me. From here on, you two will have to improvise. l'm gonna find some trouble of my own in the Ramble. Shall we have a cigarette? Good morning. This is something new. To be inconsiderate, to ignore your obligations. l know. l'm so sorry, l really am. That was unforgivable. Cole, you disappointed a lot of people last night. The London producers were there. Some Hollywood people were most anxious to speak with you. l don't want to go to Hollywood, and l don't want to fight. l don't want to fight. -And l don't want to blame. -Thank you for that, dear. But if things are gonna be different... l'd like to know. l'll tell you as soon as l know. You must have known already. l got the ending. I didn't know how much my happiness would hurt us. We couldn't hear the songs the same way anymore. Suddenly the lyrics all sounded like code. In olden days, a glimpse of stocking was looked on as something shocking Now heaven knows Anything goes Good authors, too, who once knew better words Now only use four-letter words Writing prose Anything goes If saying your prayers you like They love your song. -If green pears you like -If green pears you like -If old chairs you like -If old chairs you like Don't you? If backstairs you like -If love affairs you like -If love affairs you like If love affairs you like With young bears you like Why, nobody will oppose So though I'm not a great romancer I know that I'm bound to answer When you propose Anything goes Ellin says lrving is having a great run in Hollywood. The Gershwins are there-- You want me to leave at the top of my game? -If old hymns you like -If old hymns you like -If bare limbs you like -If bare limbs you like -If Mae West you like -If Mae West you like Or me undressed you like l'll give this to you now in case... Monty has more producers for you to visit. The set that's smart is intruding on nudist parties in studios Anything goes Anything goes Anything goes -By the way, do you want one? -No, thank you. -That's beautiful. From Linda? -Yeah, of course, opening night. Linda must be keeping Cartier in business all by herself. -She does spoil me. l don't deserve it. -No, you probably don't. Which reminds me, how's Linda? She's all right. A bit more fragile than usual, but all right. How's Patrick? There's a doctor in Zurich who may give us more time. They don't give you much hope with tuberculosis. So sorry. Does Linda know? She hasn't said anything. Yeah. She said, ''We live in castles built on sand.'' l just think that life has been one great carnival... and now we're teetering on the high wire. Yes, but you've got Sara to catch you, and l have Linda. Ever wonder who's there to catch them? When they begin The beguine It brings back the sound Of music so tender It brings back a night Of tropical splendor It brings back a memory evergreen I'm with you once more under the stars And down by the shore an orchestra's playing And even the palms seem to be swaying When they begin the beguine To live it again is past all endeavor Except when that tune clutches my heart And there we are Swearing to love forever Promising never Never to part What moments divine What rapture serene Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted I know but too well what they mean So don't let them begin the beguine Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember When they begin the beguine When they begin the beguine l am so terribly sorry, darling. l know how late l must be. Late? -Linda, you missed the whole thing. -l misplaced the cigarette case. l'd rather have had you. lt would have been bad luck. To hell with luck. This feels very wrong. l don't like bringing up this whole thing. lt happened and it was over, and that was that. We never brought it up again. Finished, done. Done, maybe. Finished? -l won't have it. -lt's not your choice. Anyway, l hope you like it. Linda, what were you thinking? You wouldn't have lost it. l had hoped not. -What are you talking about? -Nothing! Absolutely nothing. Definitively nothing. Shall we go now? l would hate to compound the felony by making us late for the party. That would be terrible, dreadful. A tragedy too great to bear. God, Linda, what's happened? Nothing, just a small thing. lt's just not like being late or missing an opening. A very small thing... that stopped growing. My sweet girl, l'm so sorry. l didn't want to tell you like this. l just went to the doctor, he said l should rest, and it got so late. l'm sorry. l wanted it so, Cole. l wanted it for us. l know. -l want to take you home now. All right? -l don't want to go home. l don't even feel like we have a home. Then we'll find a new one. We'll get out of town, we'll travel. We'll find a new place. Some place good for you and good for me. lf everyone's moved to Hollywood, then we'll go there, too. We'll try it. We'll make a fresh start. Let's just get the doctor in tonight, just to make sure you're all right. No more doctors. l already know l'm not all right. Linda, then it wasn't meant to be, that's all. So, fine, we'll be all right. We'll be just fine with what was meant to be. That's you and that's me. That's what was meant to be. l love you, Linda Porter. l love you so much. -Okay, darling, don't cheat. -lt's not in my nature to cheat. All right, okay. -All right. Ready? -l'm ready. My goodness. ls it all right? No, l'd like something a little bigger, please. lt's Hollywood, darling, we do things big out here. This is beautiful. Look at the bow. Richard! Let me show you the inside. All of Metro is proud to have you as part of our family, Cole. You said that, L.B. Thank you, l appreciate it. l wanted to tell you again, just to be sure you know. -We know you'll be happy here. -l'm already happy. Swell. That makes me happy, you're happy. You know who else makes me happy? lrving Berlin. Every song lrving Berlin writes, l love. You know why? Because his songs sound like what people who aren't clever... say to each other when they're in love. Real love songs. Not clever love songs. Could you write real love songs? When you write funny songs, l want funny-funny, not clever-funny. Could you do that for me? You're stronger if you're not angry. Tickle their ribs as you slide in the knife. Try it. I'll remember forever when I was but three Mama, who was clever, remarking to me If, son, when you're grown up you want everything nice I've got your future sewn up if you take this advice Be a clown Be a clown All the world loves a clown Act the fool, play the calf And you'll always have the last laugh Wear the cap and the bells And you'll rate with all the great swells If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread And if you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown -Be a clown -Be a clown -All the world -Loves a clown -Show 'em tricks -Tell 'em jokes And you'll only stop with top folks Be a crack jackanapes And they'll imitate you like apes Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears? Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years When crowds will pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears? Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown Be a clown, be a clown All the world loves a clown If you just make them roar Watch your mountebank account soar Wear a painted mustache And you're sure to make a big splash A college education I should never propose A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown -Give 'em quips -Give 'em quips -Give 'em fun -Give 'em fun And they'll pay to say you're A-one If you become a farmer, you've the weather to buck If you become a gambler, you'll be stuck with your luck But, Jack, you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck Be a clown Be a clown Be a clown Jesus, though, it was a relief just to have fun and... do something trite and not care a damn... and get paid a hundred times what you'd be paid for something good. I love you under my skin They'll never know the difference. What's it going to be called? What's the dreariest title ever? l bet Coley $5... that he could never write a song called I Love You. Get your money out. l'm telling you, Louis B. Mayer is going to love this. He's going to weep. l need a time of year. A month. -All right, April. -June. Perfect clich, April. ''I love you'' hums the April breeze I love you under my skin I love you Is it a sin? Certainly not. ''I love you'' hums the April breeze ''I love you'' Echo the hills ''I love you'' The golden dawn agrees As once more she sees daffodils It's spring again And birds on the wing again Start to sing again The old melody ''I love you'' That's the song of songs And it all belongs to you and me It was just one of those things Just one of those crazy flings lt's a real pearl. Go ahead, dear, take it. lt's tiny, but trust me, it's still the biggest thing... you can get your fingers around in this crowd. -You'll make big bucks on this. -That's swell. lt's something, isn't it? Yes, it's lovely. lt's so imaginative to actually have the party at the studio. ls absolutely everything in Hollywood connected to movies? Everything good. That's why we're trying to coax Cole into permanent residency. How would half of every year be? l think Hollywood's fantastic, it's like living on the moon. Or 20,000 leagues under the sea. When we started painting the town Can you believe this? Linda, Hollywood was your idea, not mine. Now you're acting like it's the worst place on earth. l had thought that the change of weather might be good for us both. l had no idea how hot the climate would really be. The climate is good for growing flowers. Everything grows wild, Cole. And the pickings are far too easy. Now and then It was great fun But it was just one of those things -Mr. Porter, how are you? -Mr. Nelson. What you did with that song is just splendid. l'd love to introduce you to my wife. Cole... I hope we could coax you into a song. Be right back. -Good song. -Thank you. There's a plan for later. Linda's being very prickly tonight, but l'll try to get away. -Plenty of company lined up? -Good company, l promise. Thank you all. This is indeed an honor and a surprise. Obviously L.B. wants you all to get home early... that's why he's asked me to sing. So here goes. Before you leave these portals To meet less fortunate mortals There's just one final message I would give to you Now you all have learned reliance On the sacred teachings of science So I hope through life you never will decline In spite of philistine defiance To do what all good scientists do Experiment Make it your motto day and night Experiment It will lead you to the light If this advice you'll only employ The future can offer you infinite joy And merriment Experiment And you'll see Good night. Thank you. What a marvelous song. l don't know it, do you? lntimately. You seem very happy, dear. l am, darling. l wish you were. -Excuse me. -The Springs will take care of that. l was actually thinking of going to Arizona. lt's so much further. l don't mind. l expect l'll be gone by the time you come home. Love for sale Appetizing young love for sale Love that's fresh and still unspoiled Love that's only slightly soiled Love for sale Who will buy? Who would like to sample my supply? Who's prepared to pay the price for a trip to paradise? Love for sale Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way I know every type of love better far than they If you want the thrill of love I've been through the mill of love Old love, new love Every love but true love Love for sale Appetizing young love for sale If you want to buy my wares follow me and climb the stairs Love for sale Aren't there always copies of those sorts of photographs anyway? Cole wanted a set for himself. These are not blackmail pictures, Linda, they're-- Mrs. Porter. They were taken for recreational purposes. Cole has a heedless appetite for life. l'm sure we agree he needs to be protected. You became devoted so very quickly, Mr. Reed. He is so easy to love. Beyond devotion, what are your ambitions? l have thought of my own theatrical agency. lt would be a company that would... keep their clients' best interests close to heart, always. As you and l do Cole's. Of course. And how many backers do you require? Only one, Mrs. Porter. Just let me know how much. l'll leave these with you. You don't sweat, do you? Not a drop. l don't believe in wasting my resources. Goodbye, Linda. It's the wrong song in the wrong style Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile But it's all right with me Welcome home. Aren't you pleased? -About the roses? -Yes. They're glorious. Are they for me? Who else? One never knows. What's wrong, Linda? Your friend Bobby Reed has been to see me... with his nefarious portfolio. Yes, he told me. -He told you? -Yes. l paid him, too, you know. No, l didn't know. Yes, he's an ambitious fellow. lt's all right. l don't think it's all right, Cole. l think it's disgusting. He's exploiting both of us. Well, yes. l like to look at it as a kind of luxury tax. A luxury tax? What an extraordinary thing to say. Do you have any idea how much you've changed? How much your behavior has changed? You have put everything that you've accomplished with your music at risk. Darling, my work has never been better. lt's flourishing. Even if we're not. Your music comes from your talent, not from your behavior. lt's all the same thing. l can't put my talent here and my behavior here... and my eating, sleeping, and drinking habits. lt's all me. l have never asked you to change. Just be discreet. Linda, l have never been discreet. What is discretion but dishonesty wrapped up in a little good breeding? l don't think you want me to be discreet, l think you want me to be different. l am partially responsible for all of this... because l have spoiled you, l have indulged you. But so has the entire goddamned world. And for what? Just a little music. Linda hated being late for anything. And the next day she was late for lunch. I only had to hear the clock strike... and look at her empty place at the table to know she was gone. Gone back to Paris. It's quite simple, really. Two people who wanted too much from each other. Porter residence. Hold one moment. -Sir. -Not now. lt's urgent, sir. Yes? All the money, all the music had deflected reality for so long... I didn't know that everything we had was so fragile. Hold it loose, hold it tight. Everything breaks. l'm going to take them to Paris next week. All of this is just.... Got to get back to a better place. And it would be good to see Linda. Morning, Cole. Are we the only ones up? Our hostess just retired. l've been up since 5:00. Writing another hit, l'm sure. l wish it was that easy. Nothing comes easy anymore. And when it does, it's lousy. l write better in my own place or the Murphys'. l'm going to swear off these house parties until l finish this score. Remind me l said that, will you? That melody sounds like it could go somewhere. Yeah, like out for a drink. Have you heard from Linda? No. No. l've written, l've wired, l've called. Nothing. l'm sorry, Cole, l'm really sorry. Maybe with time.... lt'll take more than time. l'll be back before breakfast. Just seemed so much to ask children to bear. How long will you stay? No idea. Let's go inside, it's getting cold. You see how far l'll go to get you back? l think you've gone too far this time... but l ought to be used to it by now. I'm afraid his right leg should be amputated. Perhaps the left as well. There's really no alternative. lf you amputate his legs, you will cut out his pride. You'll break his spirit, he would never work again. He'll have nothing without his music, it's the essence of him. He'd have nothing to live for. He would have his life, his friends, you. Nothing. He would just be living out his death. You're asking a lot of him. We are accustomed to asking a lot of one another. So what did the sawbones say? You get to keep the old things. And he expects you to walk, and so do l. But only if l can walk to you. As far as Williamstown? Williamstown? Massachusetts. l found a very pretty home. It's on a hill, it has a work space. Thinking of buying it. A little bump. -All right. -Now? A grand piano. That is grand. That's not quite right. So shall l leave you to it? Guess you'd better. God, l can't work the pedal. Can't work the pedals, dear. God damn it! l can't work the pedals! And what did it take... to finally work the pedals? A few years. A pharmacopoeia of pills. A reservoir of Scotch and 20 more operations. Nonstop fun. But over time, you got five shows up and running. Up? Yes. Running? Barely. At least, according to the critics. ''Not up to Mr. Porter's usual standards''... was the refrain. So when Hollywood finally called again? l was on the train before the second ring. He is the same. One of Yale's sons of whom we are all proud. Cole Porter. There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning Burning inside of me And its torment won't be through Till you let me spend my life making love to you Day and night Night and day lf l can survive this movie, l can survive anything. And you shall, darling, beautifully, like everything else. Thank you. The movie will do very well, and you'll be encouraged. l wonder, it seems like every time they operate, l lose songs as well as blood. Remind me to call the studio and tell them how much we ''absolutely loved the movie.'' Naturally. Sorry. l'm all right. Why on earth does Linda come back to Cole anyway? Because he's Cary Grant. And she misses the music, as do l. l must say, going down in history as Cary Grant is not too bad. Not for a boy from lndiana. We should be grateful to them, they found us a happy ending. Yes, happy endings. You don't get many of those, do you, in Hollywood? So this promises what, surgery number 25? Twenty-six. Good God. And how long will l have to wear the cast this time? A few months, we'll see how you mend. What's that? lt's Linda. lt's gotten that bad, then? Even if she'd agree, l don't think surgery would help. The lungs are too damaged. Dr. Moorhead, are you saying that Linda is dying? God, what a swell party this is. Four weeks, you rehearse and rehearse Three weeks, and it couldn't be worse One week, will it ever be right? Then out of the hat, it's that big first night The overture is about to start You cross your fingers and hold your heart It's curtain time and off we go Another opening of another show Miss Morrison, the line is ''away we go,'' not ''off we go,'' dear. You couldn't manage to make me hear you before... and now that l can hear you, you've got it wrong. So shall we do it again? Let's pick it up, dust it off, and get it right. The tempo was good. All right, everyone, let's go. One week, will it ever be right? Then out of the hat, it's that big first night The overture is about to start You cross your fingers and hold your heart It's curtain time and away we go Another opening Just another opening of another show Very good. Thank you, all. Carry on. And chorus... keep those consonants crisp. The audience shouldn't think you're saying, ''An annoying opening for an ugly show.'' Let them come to that conclusion on their own. Please stop that knocking. -Mr. Porter. -What? Your wife sent me to fetch you. Fetch me for what? -For tea. -l don't like tea. lt's just a few steps. She's waiting. Fine, come in. Fetch me, for Christ's sake. -Who are you, anyway? -Bill, Bill Wrather. Bill rather? Rather what? Bill Wrather. Yes, you're Linda's... -decorating wizard. Yes. -lt's a great pleasure for me, Mr. Porter. The pleasure is mine. -Can l? -No. -Are you sure? -No. Lots of practice. l will take an arm, actually. Thank you. Well, l'll be making my way. Linda, a pleasure as always. lndeed. l'll see you soon. Cole, that tune you were playing was just beautiful. l can't wait to hear that in the show. -Goodbye now. -Safe drive. -lsn't he delightful? -Lovely. We've become such fast friends. l was hoping that you might as well. He'd be a good companion for you. Linda? l don't want you to be lonely. l'm worried about you. You don't need to worry about me or your show, it's all taken care of. l'm in God's hands, the show is in yours. l do wish it were the other way round, though. Give me that cigarette. Strange, dear But true, dear When I'm close to you, dear The stars fill the sky This really needs a proper singer. l really can't do it justice. Wait till opening night, hear it sung well. l think it sounds fine right now. And l won't be there, dear. What are you talking about? Why wouldn't you be? You know the doctors, honey, they're so boring. l don't think l would add very much to it. l'm sure it will be a great occasion. lt won't be any occasion if you're not there. Darling, Bill will be with you. He'll help you. l wrote this for you. What's the point of doing it if you're not gonna be there? Well, that's why l want you to play it for me. All the way through. All right. l won't do it justice, but l'll do it. Strange, dear, but true, dear When I'm close to you, dear The stars fill the sky So in love with you am I Even without you My arms fold about you You know, darling, why So in love with you am I In love with the night mysterious The night when you first were there In love with my joy delirious -Wait. -Are you all right? A few people may have been carried out of my shows... but no one's ever been carried in. So taunt me and hurt me Deceive me, desert me I'm yours till I die So in love So in love So in love with you, my love Think of Linda a little and applaud a lot. In love with the night mysterious The night when you first were there In love with my joy delirious When I knew that you could care So taunt me And hurt me Deceive me Desert me I'm yours till I die So in love So in love So in love with you my love, am I In love with the night mysterious The night when you first were there In love with my joy delirious When I knew that you could care So taunt me And hurt me Deceive me Desert me I'm yours till I die So in love So in love So in love my love am I Bravo! Sorry, we have to move on. Please, let me enjoy this. lt took two years to get the backers interested in this show. No one wanted anything to do with it, they thought l was finished. We have to move on. Very well. We make quite a pair, don't we? We're still les colporteurs of Paris. Plying our humble trade. l could hear the score. Darling, it's giddy. lt's all about Paris. Brings back fond memories. -Those were fine days. -Yes, they were. -And we were fine. -We were fine. Finding each other. Taking care of each other. l have a little something for you. lt's a whole new flower. A gentleman in Spain did it up for me. lt's a hybrid of two varieties of rose... thought to be completely incompatible. Yet look at it, it's perfect. The Linda Porter rose. Exquisite. lt's just a pale reflection of our life together. lt wasn't all beautiful. You were always my life to be. -l remember that song. -lt was about you. They were all about you. Not all of them. But some, l hope. How l have loved you, Cole. l don't know how much longer l can stay. Would you mind terribly if l went just a little early? Every time we say goodbye I die a little Every time we say goodbye I wonder why a little Why the gods above me who must be in the know Think so little of me they allow you to go When you're near there's such an air of spring about it I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it There's no love song finer But how strange the change from major to minor Every time we say goodbye Goodbye Sara. Hello, darling. Gerald. How is he? Cole is already seated. He doesn't want anyone to feel awkward about the leg. He would still have the damn thing if Linda were here. And Monty was by for a visit. He asked to be remembered, of course. Good old Monty. Noted. So, Cole, when are we gonna get another lyric from you? l haven't the wit nor the will to write any more. Cole, you can write from everything you remember. You've had the most fascinating life. Sara. Memories. lt's like the phantom pains l get in my missing leg. They're not real and they hurt too much. l'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop. Cole, please. Don't. Oh, my God. My dear friends, l'm boring you. Let us repair to the living room for some goodbyes... and some coffee and some traveling music, shall we? Bill is all packed, and you all have a long drive ahead of you. The invitation was for the weekend. Let's pretend it's Sunday. We'll be right there. -Sara. -All right, dear. l wish you'd let me stay with you, Cole. l want to stay. Bill, please, let me at least try to do something noble, all right? What l'm trying to do is best for both of us. Then can't both of us decide, not just you? My sweet boy, there's nothing for you here. Come on now, get the wheelchair. It's the wrong time and the wrong place Though your face is charming it's the wrong face It's not her face That was evil. l'm sorry. l think you're trying very hard to misbehave. -And you used to be a better actor. -l used to be better at a lot of things. At words poetic, I'm so pathetic That I always have found it best Instead of getting them off my chest To let them rest, unexpressed You're the top You're the Coliseum You're the top Go on, get out of here. Get outta town Cole, by all means-- Before it's too late, my love Take it easy, old friend. Get outta town Be good to me please Why wish me harm? Take care of him. Why not retire to a farm and be contented to charm the birds off the trees? We love you. It's done The little dream, it's done So bid me a fond farewell we both had our fun Cole. Was it Romeo or Juliet who said when about to die ''Love is not all peaches and cream'' Little dream -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Goodbye Lonely, miserable, melancholy What a perfect musical finale. Don't worry. Never open on a ballad, never end on one either. -Do you hear that playing? -Yes, we hear that playing -Do you know who's playing? -No, who is that playing? Well it's Gabriel, Gabriel playing Gabriel, Gabriel saying ''Will you be ready to go when I blow my horn?'' Oh, blow, Gabriel blow Go on and blow, Gabriel, blow I've been a sinner, I've been a scamp But now I'm willing to trim my lamp So blow, Gabriel, blow Oh, I was low, Gabriel, low Mighty low, Gabriel, low But now since I have seen the light I'm good by day and I'm good by night So blow, Gabriel, blow Go on and blow, Gabriel, blow I want to join your happy band And play all day in the Promised Land So blow, Gabriel, blow Blow, Gabriel, blow Blow, Gabriel, blow Blow, Gabriel, blow Blow Gabriel, blow, blow, blow I want to join your happy band And play all day in the Promised Land So blow, Gabriel, blow Blow, Gabriel, blow Blow, Gabriel, blow In the still of the night As I gaze from my window at the moon in its flight My thoughts all stray to you In the still of the night While the world is in slumber Oh, the times without number Darling, when I say to you ''Do you love me ''as I love you? ''Are you my life to be ''my dream come true?'' Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill, in the chill still of the night? Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill, in the chill still of the night?
