Although I have denied any wrong doing so far... I want to tell you the so-called secrets that have landed me here. Then you can decide whether they merit this treatment. Chambolle Musigny... 19... 1985 or so. Very good. IBIS can... lubricate relationships... between your companies and its American investors... open trade barriers etc, etc. It's really a win-win situation. So Monsieur Gast, tell us a bit about yourself? There's not much to tell really. Come now... Well I studied economics at Princeton... and that led to a stint working for the government. Oh yes, and what did you do for your country? Well that's classified I'm afraid. Ah... Eliott merci, all the best. You're welcome. It was nice to meet you. My pleasure. Thank you. I'll see you later. Hey honey, it's 3am here. Flight was fine, hope you're having a good day. I'll speak to you soon. What the? Hey! Hello? Can anybody hear me? There's been a mistake. My name is Eliott Gast. I'm an American here on business. A book... some new clothes... I've been wearing this suit for three days for God's sake! And a pack of cigarettes. Cavaliers in the red box. Those are my demands... for the moment. Hello? Who's out there? Hey! It's Europe. How long? Couple of weeks. What about the weekend? I'm sorry okay. It's important, I have to go. You have very good taste. I heard that you are concerned. I'm concerned that I'm being held here against my will. I demand to be released. In good time, Eliott Gast. In the meantime, don't think of it as being detained... you're being punished. Audio on. Oui. America today is the England of Victoria... except that its empire is hidden. Its battles do not take place in open sea... but via the movement of enormous sums of money. They must have taught you this at Princeton... Eliott Gast. It will not be long... before we are fully absorbed by the US imperialists. This is our source of anger. So - we are exposing the American conspiracy... in short we are making an example of you. I think you could have chosen a better representative of American imperialism. Audio off. Oui. That, like so many other things its not for you to decide. You have made your choices... and now you must accept the consequences... Look, whatever your opinion of me, my work or my government... it does your cause no good to take hostages. On that point you are wrong Gast. Capturing you is the best thing that's ever happened to us. You are the golden goose. The one that lays the golden eggs. We will talk again, I enjoy discussion very much. Get some sleep... tomorrow is a very important day. Please. Why am I here? I'm not here to discuss ideology. I am your liaison, nothing more. My liaison? To the others. They make the plans. What plans? For now I am here to make sure your needs are met. Your accommodations I assume is comfortable for you? For a jail. Yes. But I'm being detained illegally... I demand to be released. You're afraid. I understand. But this is just the beginning. My family will be very concerned. My wife will already have alerted the authorities in the US. And my children... You have no children! Now. Please. Sit. Who is in charge here? What do they want from me? Perhaps you need reassurance. Then know this. We are committed to our ideals, but we are not extremists. The difference? Extremists wear the bomb. We do not have a bomb Monsieur. All we have is you. I'm flattered. Perhaps you should be. We have been watching you for some time... Monsieur Gast. Your role is important, the most important of all. Some things are going to happen to you... some thing that will change you forever. I advise you to prepare. Have a seat Eliott. I've explained your role... now its time for you to play your part. It's ok, It's ok. Be thankful we are not amateurs. Let's begin shall we. Wait... wait... no... No, too soon... fifteen minutes. Ortolon, a traditional South-Western dish. Ortolon? A tiny bird. A type of bunting. They are captured alive, force-fed grains steeped in butter... and then drowned in Armanac... next they're roasted whole and eaten bones and all with the fingers. Sounds exquisite. To capture the scent of the birds. Or to hide your face from God. Monsieur Gast. It's time for your tablets. It was absolutely brilliant Gast... that bit with the pill... the sympathy is pouring in... and the money too of course. Will you release me? It is not enough... not even close to our stated goal. I can... I can get you money. If only it were that simple... Just think of this unfortunate injury as a great opportunity. You Americans are always eating too much... devouring meat the body cannot digest... it sickens me. But why me? To truly change a man... you must take away what's most important to him... you must take away a rich man's fortune... a passionate man's wife. You're a man of the senses Eliott Gast... so we are eliminating them. By this method we can leave you thoroughly changed... but your example can change thousands. Your nurse tells me that the pain is lessening. Don't worry Eliott... Gast, we have captured their attention... now we're just working on getting our message across. So just rest... relax... we have much more collaboration to do... much more. Too bad... Eliott Gast... I thought we would remain civil to one another. Eliott! Open the door right now! I didn't do anything! I said open this door! You cannot stay in there forever... I am... Eliott Gast... I am Eliott Gast... am... Are you feeling better? I understand, it must hurt you to speak. You understand nothing. What do you mean? If you really understood you wouldn't allow them to continue. Audio off... audio off. Oui. I must speak quickly, please understand... while I believe in our cause... I do not agree with their methods. I must keep my opinions to myself. A lot of good that does me. I will help you M. Gast... believe me... What's going on? I ask that the audio remain on at all times unless I say otherwise. We were discussing his medical condition. I just wanted a few moments of privacy. Privacy? Let me explain... we're not just watching you Eliott Gast... we are broadcasting you to the world. You're like a celebrity... an online hostage. Sustain interest will generate more financial contribution for us... In the future all conversations must be recorded... understand? Oui. Hey kid! What you doing here? Hey! Get away from my little brother. I can't leave you alone for a minute. I didn't do anything to them. Doesn't matter. Being innocent never meant you wouldn't get beat up. I have nothing to do with any conspiracy. I'm an economist for IBIS and nothing else. IBIS is your country's economic CIA. My work has nothing to do with politics. Your denials are annoying me more and more! Perhaps the time has come to hurt you again. Anyway... we are letting the people decide what lies ahead. This is being done in a truly democratic fashion. We've put forward the evidence to the world and asked them to judge you... for a price of course. How much have you raised so far? The money's not important... what is truly interesting is how the people are voting... and the votes say we should go ahead. Hasn't anyone voted to have me released? Of course... but they are less vocal. Now you know what it feels like to be in the minority Eliott Gast... to be controlled by the cruel wishes of the majority in the same way as the Basques... the Flemish... the Irish... the Iraqis, the Kurds... the Tibetans, the Aborigines, the Native Americans... think about that. Showtime Eliott Gast! Scream then... More action means more money... and more money means you get released sooner- are you making the connection? Here nurse, your patient needs you. No, no. Scream damn you. Give the people what they want. My tongue, oww my nose... it hurts so bad mummy. Make it stop. Fuck you! It's a beautiful day outside Gast... a touch of what you Americans call Indian summer? Unfortunately for you, you cannot enjoy it because you're... otherwise engaged. Haven't you done enough already? There is still much to do. Yesterday's activities did not generate the levels of interest we expected. I have to ask you to work a little more closely with us. Your resistance is simply prolonging your suffering, practice your screaming - please. Why don't you just kill me now? It would be so obvious... so crude... so Archduke Ferdinand. It is easy to kill... in your country children go to school and do it. What a typically American idea that I should just kill you huh? And how should I do it hmm? Should I set fire to you? Should I strangle you? Or should I shoot you? Maybe I should ass-fuck you to death? My thick cock will make short work of you. People will be finding this scene intriguing and disturbing don't you think? Eliott Gast? No-one is amused by the suffering of others. People are always fascinated by pain and suffering... as long as its not their own. Perhaps... but people have empathy as well... A man who single-handedly affected... the lives of millions for the worst now talks of empathy? Go now. One more thing... your nurse is not coming today... she is meeting with the others in the group so we can reassess her personal resolve... she sends you this. Good morning Eliott. Where is she? She has responsibilities beyond tending to you. Why are you doing this? If you want attention you have to go completely over the top. This week, an earthquake in China has killed thousands. Dissidents in Belarus have taken over a nuclear reactor. A new virus has been identified in India. A young mother in Liverpool has killed her baby in the microwave. This is our competition Eliott Gast. We have to do something so audacious that people will notice it. Small acts simply splash on the surface like a stone thrown into a pond. You, on the other hand, continue to set new records. Millions have watched, more every day. You really enjoy this... I'm simply doing my part. I disagree. Of course you would. My advice - practice your screaming. Why you held me here? You have to scream loud if you want to be heard over the incredible din of the world. You have to be, Pow! Over the top! Boom... over the top. There's no reason for this to continue. Imagine what this feels like. You can see me... you've seen what goes on in this hellhole... I know that. But that's not enough... you're not doing anything about it... you're not making it stop... so you're a collaborator... you're giving them an audience. If you quit watching it will stop... if you keep watching, it will continue. You are angry with me. Where have you been? My time is not my own. You must be punished for your role in the American conspiracy Monsieur Gast. This way we can send a powerful message to the world. You told me you would help me. I think I know how you can. I'm not in a position to do that right now. Our purpose is clear... our resolve unshakable. Please... argue with me. What is happening here will not affect national policies. This is a personal assault. Your work made you a public figure. You represent the vast apparatus that your government has put in place to control us. I represent only myself. And your attempts to turn me into some kind of symbol are truly misguided. Imagine if I were your brother or your husband, how would you like to see them mistreated like this? I have no husband. Our files on you are open to the public M. Gast, it is up to them whether to deserve this treatment or not. We're selling lead soldiers... for 50 cents. Thanks. He did what? Eliott stole money from a blind boy. Eliott! Eliott! Open the door right now! I didn't do anything! I said open this door! Darby told me what you did. You cannot stay in there forever. Stay the hell away from me! Greetings Earthling. Get away! Fetch. Get away! If I were you I'd leave them in. Stop it! Please stop! For all those that have suffered at the hands of US aggression. Stop! Please stop! Finally some action around here eh! Bio-polymer. Made from sheep's plasma and resin. Usually they apply it underneath the skin graft to get the right kind of bond. Incredible stuff. Expensive too. Eliott Oh, it's too much! Stop! Oh! It's too much, please! What is too much anymore? We have an obligation to our audience. A little more emoting would be good right now. Oh God... If I find it in my shit I'll be sure to tell you. If you're going to vomit, do to your right... that's your best camera angle. Don't pass out on us now Gast! The fun has just started. We'll be right back after a word from our sponsors. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Just keep doing what you are doing. Contributions are up... and here's an interesting aspect Eliott Gast... there's been a turn of tide in you favour. Many people are asking for your release... there have been highly visible media campaigns... a Washington Post editorial... statements in local government... and your wife... has been very active in gathering support. Despite her heart warming efforts... more people are making donations to see our project continue than to stop it. Any teenage boy that can get his hands on a credit card number has been donating money... and offering up intriguing ideas as to what we should do next. Now for the good news, we have found that there is a high percentage of return visitors. People are seeking us out... following us like fans - we are truly famous Eliott. We have become a recognisable brand. I'll leave you to your thoughts. But if I were you, I'd keep talking... I'd talk as much as I could... because very soon it will be very quiet for you Eliott Gast... that I promise you. We don't have much time Eliott. Time for what? To talk in confidence. I have temporarily disabled their cameras. Please help me. All I can do I tell you what I know so that you can prepare. Don't they have their money yet? They have reached their goal and more... this is where there is disagreement. Understand, our group is diverse by its nature... there are various... Just get me outta here... We are wasting valuable time discussing the impossible. Stop it! This is your work. I am sorry... Then help me. I will do what I can. I want to unmask your pirate friend. I need you to tell me when the time is right. I will give you a signal. Good. We don't have much more time Eliott. You must know that what comes next will be very difficult. I cannot stop the others from continuing... but I can tell you this... your mind is what makes you who you are... even when your body is damaged... your mind will remain in tact. I'd prefer to have both. No... they are committed to moving ahead. Because there's so much money coming in? Oui, this is one of the reasons... and now there are more... more personal... Camera on. Confessing your sins is one of the first steps towards redemption Mr. Gast. I would take this time to reflect upon your life. I've done little else. Please accept my deepest apologies. I have sinned, I stole money deliberately... I pray that God in His goodness will rescue me from my little tendencies. I have taken advantage of an affliction... in doing so I've demeaned not only myself, but my family, my state and my race. For that I sincerely apologise. You have been watching me... for several weeks now. Sometimes I'm walking around... other times I have been writhing in pain... at all times I have been a prisoner. I know that efforts are underway to gain my release... and I appreciate that. I wanna thank my wife for doing what she can... to help end this pointless and barbaric charade... but I have something else to say... Although I have denied any wrong doing so far... I wanna tell you the so-called secrets that have landed my here... then you can decide whether they merit this treatment... For the last three years... I have been active in encouraging target nations to accept loans... large loans... packaged as unrestricted American aid. Before long these nations default on repayment as we intended... its like issuing credit cards to college students... they become beholden to us so we can ask them to help us however we need them to... politically... militarily. Debt is better than any treaty, believe me. But I realise now that is has consequences. By putting American interests first... I'm sure we've made life worse, much worse for many people. I didn't think about this at the time... but I do now, and I sincerely apologise. More... What? Say something else. Punishing me for my work... is like beating the paperboy for bringing bad news. I did not authorise the loans. I delivered them to corrupt officials but I didn't tell them what to do with it. I am a small cog in a system that is beyond my control. I am not responsible for all that I'm being blamed for. More si' vous plait. Okay then. I single-handedly dreamed up globalisation. I like the world Trade Organisation. I eat junk food all day long, sometimes all week. I'm intent on burning down the rainforest and building luxury condos there. On weekends I club sea turtles and dolphins and baby seals... Will they release me now? They're angry enough with you as it is... do not push your luck. Its time to focus not on what you've lost, but on what you still have. Just try and think of this as a second chance. Well it's easy for you to be so glib... you're not the one being tortured. This much is true, but you are missing my point. Right, that little bit about the mind... how I should be lucky to still have one. Well, after a month in this room... with only you and the others to talk to... I'm not sure that I do. Here... Why are you here anyway? Did they send you in ere to find out more about my brilliant career? I have nothing left to confess. I asked to come in here. Why? I enjoy you company. Likewise... There's only one problem... I'm losing my mind, do you hear me? I've had enough! I know. I told you I will try and help you... You call this helping! I'm sorry, there was nothing I could do. Just get me outta here! Have faith Eliott... you will leave here soon... but there is still much ahead for you. Then let's just get it over with! Bring on the torture! I'm already broken! Cut off more parts! Burn me some more! Take it over the top! It's easy, it's easy! You're boring our audience. Good, fuck them. Turn around. Now! You're too much of a coward. You hide behind you mask, behind your ridiculous features. Everyone watching knows you're an idiot! Good, we're getting somewhere. Say something else. You lay claim to some kind of moral superiority but you're a fucking hypocrite... a spoiled child... your beliefs are naive. And you are better? You know nothing about me. I know what you stand for and I detest it! Well you got your work cut out then... there are millions more where I came from. Then I will fuck each and every one of you... You... fuck you! Fuck you... fuck! Just a minute. Do you mind? Stop this! Stop this! Tell them to let me go! Call the embassy chief and tell them to pay whatever they want. Get the money from IBIS, just tell them they need to stop! I just wanna go home. More excitement! And a touch of creativity, I'm impressed... as I'm sure is our audience. Everyone wants you to be a hero Eliott Gast. They are cheering you on. Unfortunately you won't be able to hear them. Despite the recent excitement... this part requires concentration and a calm mind, otherwise the pain will be unbearable... and the procedure unsuccessful. I've confessed already, I've confessed! I've given everything you wanted. I understand... please, allow me... to ease the pain... You tell those folks what you did. Please accept my deepest apologies... I have sinned. I've stolen money deliberately... I pray that God in his goodness to rescue me from my little tendencies. I've taken advantage of an infliction. In doing so I've demeaned not only myself, but my family, my state and my race. I didn't think about this at the time... but I do now. And for that I sincerely apologise. Any last words? It'll be a pleasure not to have to hear the sound of your ridiculous voice ever again. Very brave Eliott. The audience will really enjoy your defiance. Anything else? I'm sorry Eliott, I was not... Enough with the love talk. Here are my last words! Never forget what you have done Eliott Gast. You are not innocent you fuck! Oh, I have a message from one of your very loyal supporters... Whoever you are... please let Eliott go. He's a kind, loving, gentle man. A wonderful husband... I don't know what I'd do without him. Eliott, if you can hear this, I love you... It's Europe. Okay. I just got the call. How long? Couple of weeks... What about the weekend? I'm sorry, okay. It's important, I have to go. I'll see you in three weeks. No! You're crazy. You're crazy. You're all fucking crazy. Then leave me alone. If you have any shred of human kindness. Please just leave me my eyes. You've taken everything else... Christ, you're actually going to cut out my eyes? This isn't the sort of operation that... It's a different thing. You can't just, you can't just do it. You don't have to do this. Wait, wait, just wait. Nim! Turncoat! Show him, show him... show him how much you love him! Show him! Show him how much you love him! Show him... Cameras off! Cameras off! Completely! Over! The... How could you lie to me? How could you lie to me? No!
