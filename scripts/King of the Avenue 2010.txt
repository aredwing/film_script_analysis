And all respect due, l don't think you'd never ever have a professional black golfer. l don't know about that. Oh, come on, now, Scooter Pie. Next thing you know he's gonna be talkin' about a black president too. You better do whatever the fuck you gotta do to make sure you count boss man's money right too. Y'all need to apologize. Fuck him. Man, kiss my ass. Done deal, right? With all that shit talking you did, y'all just woke boss man's baby boy, Where your daddy at, boy? He's taking a shower. Let me ask you something. Do those pajamas hide the pee stain when you wet the bed? Go on back into the bed before your daddy catch you while you're awake, go, go ahead. Why you go say some dumb shit like that? Mommy just needs to take her medicine. Hey, Daddy. What's the flashlight for, Taz? l told you l ain't raisin' no punk. l got the same dream again. lt's just a dream, little man. Your momma Ioved you, you know that. Get some sleep. Daddy? Do you kill people? What made you ask that? l got into a fight with Malcolm at school. Did you get your ass kicked? No, l beat him pretty bad. Yeah. So what's the problem? He gave me his Iunch money and apologized, but some kids told me that my daddy was gonna kill his daddy. Two things: one, it doesn't Iook like you're gonna need lunch money tomorrow, and two l'm not ever gonna lie to you. Now, l wouldn't kill somebody's daddy for a fight between two little kids, but if somebody took something from me, or hurt somebody that l loved, l mean, if somebody hurt you real bad l wouldn't kill their daddy. l'd kill their whole family. l love you, Daddy. l love you too. There now. You get some sleep. Guess what? One day, this is gonna be yours. Woo! l'm digging this shit all day, son. Fucking-h right. This the mother fucking future right here, son. Hey, Dooney, turn on the TV. The Lakers on. Right, Boss. In sports- Walk away from the TV, Dooney. What? l said walk away from the TV. Come on. Just walk away. Uh-huh. Now walk back toward. Oh, come on. Shut up, mother fucker. Walk back to me. You see that shit? Hm. What? Shut the fuck up. Open your shirt. Wha-? Shut the fuck up. What the fuck, man. Open your shirt. You better be quiet about it. Now, you're gonna tell them everything's cool. Everything -everything is cool, man. Tell them you gotta go to the bathroom. -l'm going to the bathroom for a minute. Now take your fuckin' pants down now. No, what the fuck, man? Take your mother fucking pants down. Take your mother fucking pants off. Huh? What the fuck, man? Open your mouth. They were giving me 25 years, man. Open your mother fucking mouth, huh? You fuck over your niggers, right? Suck that shit like a good bitch. Get your bitch ass up, come on, keep the shit in your mouth. Keep it in the mouth, easy. Twenty five years, man. Come on. Are you okay, Uncle Dooney? l'm as far away from okay as you can get, little man. How come? l betrayed my friends. They were gonna give me 25 years. They were gonna take me away from my family for a long time. That's a Iot of time, huh, Dad? Yeah, that's a long time, son. l think you did the right thing, Uncle Dooney. Because l wouldn't want to be away from my dad that long. Turn around and sit straight. You seen that? Yeah. See, that's what happens when you betray your friends. You know better than to talk about this to anyone, you got it? Okay. l love you, Daddy. Yeah, l Iove you too. My father's life, a drug dealer, A killer and dead at 38, He left behind a son that loved him very much. And l did, He was my world, Despite what he did and who he was, l loved him as if he was a doctor, a fireman, a humanitarian, but he wasn't, He was, for the most part, one of those people that society could probably do without, Nevertheless, he was my father, my first example of what a man should be like l watched people treat him like a god so to me he was a god, I feared him as much as I loved him, and I wanted to be just like him. That's probably why l became a drug dealer, I tried to make sure my father's fate wasn't mine, Like most people in my Jine of work, l thought l was smarter than the game, l didn't play it like everyone else, Although l could afford to live anywhere, l chose to live somewhere upscale but not too upscale where my finances would be an issue, Nobody wanted to see someone too flashy in a conservative neighborhood, So to the people who lived around me and my family, l was Joe Ordinary, I lived what I considered the sucker's life, nine to five till you die. But most importantly, I had a routine. Good morning, Taz. Good morning, Greta. Kiss my wife, Amanda, and our son who I named after my father, Norman, Remember we play the Tigers today. At six o'clock. Have l ever forgotten? Taz.. . Done, l'm there, Mwah. Bye, baby. Bye. l told everyone, including Amanda, I was the East Coast rep for a West Coast consulting firm. That way no one could ask to come by my job or see where I worked. You know, Greta, you water that same spot every morning. Mm-hmm. Now this, this was my dope house, l just call it that because l would never have drugs of any kind here, I'm the boss. I leave that to the soldiers. I just all it that because it's where I do all my dirt. After Mom died, nobody wanted to let a known black drug dealer adopt a white orphan but hey, cash is king, And after years of fighting with courts, l was his, There you are again, with that photo album. When l got older, I realized that family is someone that you end up with, You don't have a choice in the matter, l swear you look at that thing a hundred times a week, But what he did to make me his son was a choice and it made me love him even more. Baby. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Hello? Alright, l'll see l'll see you in a little bit. Am l not on the fucking phone? l'm taking your car. No you're not. l'm taking it. You take the truck. l don't feel like driving that big old thing. You're the one that wanted the SUV with 20 TVs in it, not me. That shit is ghetto. Oh, l know you didn't call me ghetto. l'm not saying you're ghetto. l'm saying driving around in a SUV with But, baby, isn't that what you say, the man makes the car, not the other way around? Right? You're always saying that. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, you're learning. The answer is still no. Why? As calm as I was playing, what was about to happen would be huge, So huge it was sure to make me king of the avenue, l was getting ready to make a deal with the Mexicans, l start by getting my product at wholesale, that's about half, only thing was, you better promise to buy a minimum every month, Come hell or high water, you better buy that minimum, But l wasn't worried, l was moving so much shit, l was already doubling minimum. l had just hooked up with these bikers, See, they were white supremacists and would buy from me before my black and Latin peers, l used to think how my father would feel about me working with racists, But then, I figured he woulda told me to take their money first, Cal, My most trusted friend and general of my operation, The son of Scooter Pie. You'll be king of the avenue for sure after this. King? No. This is just about the money. Fuck that. Your daddy was fucking king, man, it's your fucking birthright. Yeah, look what happened to him. l'm not going out like that, man. l'm just getting my cake and l'm out. Then you could be king. Fuck it. l'll be king after you? Shit. White folks don't wanna see me living next to them acting like l'm a fucking consultant. No, we don't. You know what l'm saying? l was playing it cool to Cal, Being the king was my birthright and I wanted it more than anything, And I mean anything! I would do it or gladly die trying. Pop! What the fuck! You fucking back-doored my deal? You shouldn't disturb what we got going on here. We already made the deal. My deal? Hector, l thought we had an understanding. You guys ain't my family. l don't give a fuck about you. What l care is about me getting my money. I don't care who I make the deal with, Dooney Jr, son of the man my father killed when turning informant. Current king of the ave, What the fuck were you thinking, white boy? Not supposed to buy from anybody but me. That's the rules. You know 'em, mother fucker. The only reason you ain't stinkin' in a fuckin' dumpster right now is 'cause Scooter Pie talked me out of it. The only reason l listen to him is because he's my general. And his son is your general. Otherwise -l woulda come to your house and kill you myself. l'll tell you something, white boy. King of the ave was made for men like me. And as much as it kills me to say it, for men like your father. Get this through your head. You're never, ever gonna be king. l suggest we go into my restaurant and have a couple margaritas, King, baby. Who the fuck did you tell? l didn't tell nobody. Fuck! What do you want to do? Nothing. Let's go home. But we need to talk this shit out. We seen Dooney Jr. kill for much less than this. Fuck that shit he was saying. Only reason he didn't try something is he didn't want to get Hector in the crossfire. Just go home. Come on, man. Go! Mother fucker, Hector! Fuck! Taz, you missed the game. l know, l'm sorry. Work just got crazy. l got to go to the west coast. When? Now, l gotta go now. The kids are all meeting for pizza. Alright. Okay. You know, he didn't even let them clear the scoreboard until his daddy saw how good he did. Fifty five to five. That's a good old-fashioned butt-whipping. Sorry, little man. Daddy'll see you next time, okay? Stop. Here. Do me a favor and just go out to dinner with your friends or something, alright? Are you okay? Yeah, l'm fine. l just need to take some shit out. But what about you? Jesus Christ, you not fucking listening to me? l said go! Why be a fucking ass to me all the time? Sorry. Cal. Yeah, what's up? Yeah, meet me at the spot tomorrow. Tell everyone to stand alert. Alright. Fuck. Mommy just needs to take her medicine. Fuck! Damn. Tia. Tia! Cumegu. Amulachio. Shh. Out of the frying pan. Who are you? Who do l appear to be? Yeah. l'm him. What do you want from me? A favor. And in return for that favor, l will deliver you right where you want to be. King of the avenue. For my soul? We're overcrowded with souls. We get thousands a day. Not to mention the billions we already have. Your one meager soul makes no difference either way. But why? Why you? You're one of my best workers. You're just providing a service. They have to get it from somewhere. Might as well be you, right? l don't want this anymore. l'm done. You know, Taz, sometimes we do too much to turn around. How do you know when you've crossed that line? How do we know when it's too Iate for us? Call me conservative, but when l appear in your living room, as a rule of thumb you can probably assume you've crossed that line. Dooney Junior's king. He's the one doing your work. You need him. The world sees Dooney Jr. as a common street thug. Only com for table in the hood. He can't go to the places l need him to go. You can. You're an all-American white male. Blue-eyed to boot. That's all l need to put you where you need to be. So here's the deal plan. You become king and do my bidding and l will save your family from Dooney Junior. You've got no choice. Let's face it. He hates you. For what your father did to his. And he's been waiting for a reason . Dooney Jr. is plotting to kill your family as we speak. And once he's had his way with your precious Amanda, her summer dress pulled up, bent over your kitchen sink, back dooring her, he's gonna go to work on your little boy. Little Norman as he makes you watch. Whatever you decide, deal with me. l will meet you tomorrow at midnight at your father's final resting place. lf you're not there, l'll take that as a no and Ieave you alone. Baby. What are you doing on the floor? Something told me to come home. Let's get you in bed. My father broke by the rules, right? Well, what happened? Huh? Taz's father killed him, right? Two days before my fuckin' tenth birthday, how the fuck you think l felt on my birthday? You know, l'm the wrong motherfucker to ask for forgiveness. You cannot live by your father's life. You're not getting what l'm saying, man. lt's a done fuckin' deal. What are you talkin' about? l already sent one of my boys to nail him. You gotta have permission from the commission before you kill a boss. They're gonna find out where his girlfriend lives, where his son lives, they're gonna do 'em too. Why the boy's family? 'Cause l'm not gonna make the same mistake his father did. See -Taz's son will grow up one day, man, and the only way to keep the weed from growin' is to take it from the roots. And don't worry, man. l told him to make sure not to touch Cal. Let me ask you something, Scooter. What side are you on? l'm on your side, boss man. l don't wanna go. lt's too dangerous. But l'd rather be in danger with you than stay without you. Where the fuck are my keys? lt's all right. Shit. You all right? Fuck. You okay? Yeah. l'll get the car and put it in the garage. Are you okay? Yeah, l'm fine! Go clean up. You know, Pops called. Said Daddy Junior put out the hit. We need to do something, man. l thought l heard a scream . Where do you live? l live next door! Right next door? You didn't hear shit. Okay, man. Okay. l didn't see anything. And l didn't hear anything. Okay. All right. lt appears as if we have a deal. So what now? You become the king. What, so, you just wave your hands around and do some magic or something or what? Do l look like a Ieprechaun to you? Then what? Open it. What? Fuck that! Aren't you the devil? Can't you just raise him out of there or something? Contrary to popular belief, l don't just wave a magic wand. Different events have to take place for you to become this king. For those events to happen, l must bring forth a demon. This demon needs a host. And to show that this is your will, kind of like the signing of the proverbial contract, the host must be only the people you love the most. The only reason to do this is to save my family. l'm an opportunist, l really don't care why you're doing it. As long as you're doing my will. Thanks. Jesus! You've signed your contract. l'll take it from here. Hello? Taz. Amanda. Honey, you need to come home. Why? What's wrong? Baby, l don't know how to tell you this. Why? What happened? The people from the cemetery called. Somebody dug up your father's grave and and stole his remains. Did you hear what l just said? Yeah. Oh my God. That's horrible. What did they say? Don't worry about that right now. Can you please just come home? l'm really scared. Okay. Uh l gotta call you back. Give me your hand. Why? Now. You need anything? Why? Scooter Pie gave me your stuff. l never got rid of it. You want something to eat? l don't eat. So, what do we do now, Pops? My name is De'Sha. Oh. Okay. Let's get one thing clear. l don't give a fuck about you. l'm a demon straight from hell. Sent to wreak havoc and do whatever is necessary to make you king of the avenue. So don't think, just because l'm in this body that it somehow ties us emotionally. l'm here to do his will. And if l'm commanded l'll take you out and leave you on the field for dead. That's just what l do. And that's the story of you and me. Now go get dressed. Whoa, how'd you know about that? l know everything you know. Pop the trunk. Yeah! Council meeting? l didn't know anything about a council meeting. Huh. That's 'cause it's about you. So now J'm the motherfucking bad guy? Dooney, you know you can't put a hit on a boss without all us votin' on it. Those are the rules. That mother fucker broke the rules first. l agree with Dooney. You would. What the fuck's that supposed to mean? Nigger. It means Dooney gives you your shit for a discount. So you're gonna agree with anything he says. You his bitch. Stanley, shut the fuck up. l'll sell my shit to whoever the fuck l want for whatever the price l want to. Anybody got a problem with that? l don't blame Taz for doing what he did. Shit. You ain't showing nobody no love. A nigger gonna fuck around and starve to death dealing with you. Motherfuckers, l am the mother fucking king! Me! And the rules are: nobody can buy shit from nobody but me unless l say otherwise. l chose these mother fucking bandits from wild wild west. Dooney, calm dow-! Calm down! We don't need to start a war. l think what we need to do is let Taz answer some of these accusations. Mother fucker, of course you gonna say that! You mother fucking white boys stick together. White boy? l'm Italian. Same shit to me. A white boy that eats good. l didn't come here to get disrespected. Mother fucker, l'm the one that disrespected in this bitch! Dooney, come on. Dooney, just chill. l mean nobody's disrespecting you, alright? Right, Ed? Stanley? l'm just sayin' what's on my mind. Ain't that why we had these meetings? Let's just fucking vote, alright? Who's not in favor of the hit on Taz? Raise your hand. And who's in favor of the hit? See? Vote came to an end. That's it. His ass is mine. Prepare for a baptism. Now who said your vote didn't count? Three things. One, this never happened. Two, Taz is now the new king of the avenue. And three y'all gonna get your shit for half price from now on. See? That's what the fuck l'm talkin' about. Yeah. lt's not like we don't appreciate all this. But you just killed five! Watch your tone, mother fucker! You just killed five bosses and the king. lt's gonna be all-out war out there on the streets. l'll handle that shit. Y'all just go about business as usual. And you remember, when the mother fucker's in the room, you just talk to the mother fucker, you don't yell at him. You got that? Yes. Say l'm a bitch-ass nigger. l'm a bitch-ass nigger. At the time, l wasn't aware of what had just happened, especially because the demon showed the same emotion as if he had just swatted a fly. But that was only the tip of the iceberg, lt would've been an all-out war if the crews of the dead bosses woke up the next morning and found out what happened to their Ieaders. Except for the crews of these bosses, waking up was not an option, That night, I drove the demon around as he massacred 28 of the most influential people in the gang, Sometimes it's not how many you kill, it's who you kill. lt was actually pretty easy for him. No one even knew there was a war, Everyone just had their guards down, so he just kind of picked them off like fish in a barrel. Ask them what they want. What do you want? A lot of people died last night. A lot of people die every night. Yeah, but you're not one of them. Fancy police work. You think this is a joke? l think the joke is you guys are here at my door saying that you're here 'cause l'm not dead. A lot of your constituents were murdered last night. Constituents? Yeah. You're a drug dealer, right? Drug dealing is illegal in the state of Florida. Where were you Iast night? Where were you? What? What you're basically saying is l'm a suspect because l'm alive. That would make you a suspect too. Where were you last night? l know where he was. l came over Iast night. Twice. Okay? l looked at this boy straight in the eyes and l told him, ''Turn the music down.'' He wouldn't turn the music down. He wouldn't listen to me. Hey, wh -where you guys going? Hey! Hey! l told them what you wanted me to say. Please don't hurt me. Please. Please. We have to meet with the Mexicans. Twenty eight bodies in one night, You had a busy night. And it shows. Man. That gotta be some kind of record. l'm not impressed. l don't know what you're talking about. So l take it you're here for the same deal l gave Dooney Jr. Yeah. The deal that was supposed to be mine. l don't trust him. Hector, what's up with your boy? Dooney was gonna get him tickets for a game. Well, tell him l'll give him season tickets if he just shuts the fuck up, alright? Taz -don't Hector. l'm here to do business. The deal's yours. Good. Good. We'll be in touch. Look, you taco eating mother fuckers Wouldn't that be chicken eating mother fucker? Well, l guess we all gonna be some chicken taco eatin' mother fuckers. The old deal is off. The new deal is 10% less. Dooney Jr. and all the crew's gone, we gonna be moving making a lot more money. So pony up, mother fuckers. Hi, guys. Your order, please. l guess we'll be having chicken tacos. Okay. What the fuck? Who is it? lt's me, boy. Come on, Pop, use your key. Well I'll be calling your ass. lt's about Taz. Baby. Go take a shower. Police have few leads, but the question in everyone's mind is vigilante justice or the biggest turf war in decades? Where's Taz? l talked to two of the other bosses. And they say that Taz is the new king of the avenue. ln one night? Hold up, Pop. They're saying Taz did all this? I, like this they ain't speakin' all of it. but he's now the fucking top dog. Who the top crew? Holy shit! He fucking did it! We top crew? l gotta get dressed. l gotta find Taz. Good. 'Cause l'm going with your ass. Let me go throw some clothes on. My boy. What's up? You the man, How you pull that off? l'll fill you in later, all right? Hey, Scooter. Taz. So, uh, l gotta leave for a little while. l need you to run ship while l'm gone, okay? Done deal. Son, l gotta talk to Taz for a minute. About what? Well, get your ass in the car. Hey, Cal, give us a minute, alright? Alright. Alright. We top crew. What's up? Did you do this? l did what l had to do to protect my family? l know. Now look. l need a job. Done. Taz. My son, Cal, he's all l got. l do whatever l gotta do to make sure that he's safe. l didn't want this life for him, man. But you know, kids see everything. Even though we think they're not paying attention, they are. Shame on us for that. We tried to make you tough. l mean, we used to say ''We ain't raisin' no punks'' and with that, we gave our kids a front row seat to our world of death and destruction. And all I can ask of you is if you need some bad shit to be handled let me do it, man. This boy Ioves you, man. And he Ioves his life, and he ain't about to walk away, man. l'm gonna make damn sho that he's gonna be safe. Okay. Promise me. l promise. Now you go home, take your ass to bed, get some rest 'cause you look like shit on a stick. Boss man. The demon told me to go home for 30 days to let everything cool down, l told Cal the things l wanted him to do and that I was gonna be out of sight for a month, He didn't understand why but but Cal was my best friend, my absolute soldier, He didn't question too much of what l said, He just did it. Wow. Baby. l'm sorry l passed out Iast night without saying anything. Well, no. You came in on Thursday night, passed out and didn't say anything. lt's now Saturday morning. No shit. Yeah, no shit. l just figured you were still upset about your father. What do you mean? About your father's remains. How'd you know about that? Taz, l'm the one that told you. Oh. Oh, yeah. ls everything okay? Everything's fine. Could we just not talk about it right now, please? Yeah. Sure. Gonna take a shower. Throw the ball, Dad. Ah, those 30 days were the best 30 days of my life, Being the king was what l thought l always wanted to be, And now that I had it, I'd have gladly given it all away just to relive those 30 days, How long are you gonna be gone, Dad? Just a couple of days and l'll be back to my normal schedule. But l don't want you to go. Stop crying, Norman. Hey, l said stop crying! l ain't raisin' no punk. Daddy? l won't be a punk anymore. ls Norman sleeping? Yeah. What's the matter? He was crying 'cause he didn't want me to leave. l told him l wasn't raisin' no punk. Taz! That's what my dad used to say to me. He knows you didn't mean it. Hey Can l enjoy a glass of wine with my husband before he leaves? Norman's gonna be fine. He's strong. Just like his daddy. Cheers. We made more money in one month than we have in the past six months. The shit with the Mexicans is gonna set us forever. Everyone is scared of us. We're a fuckin' powerhouse. Pops even said he ain't seen a king more powerful. You the shit, Taz, and everyone knows it. What the fuck's wrong with you? You ain't said two words since you got in the car. You wanna get married, man? Have some kids? Where the fuck did that come from? Man, don't waste that shit on me. l mean, that's cool for you 'cause you the boss man. But me? l'm a rider. You and Pops, the only family l want. That's it. After that, l don't give a fuck. Change this radio station. Let's put on some white boy music. Why you always gotta go playing that white boy shit, man? Hip hop's where it's at, dawg. Hip-hop's dead. Stanley wants to meet us here? Yeah, he asked for a meeting with the king. lt's like being the mayor. You gotta shake some hands, kiss some babies. Surprise! What's this? Everyone's here to show you respect. Welcome you as the new boss man. l love you, mother fucker. We made it. Taz. l've been in the game a long time. l'm gonna tell you it ain't never been this good. Appreciate it. Thank you. We appreciate it too. Of course. Congrats. Now let's go party with these ladies. Dude, for real. You know what l mean? Watch out. What the fuck you say to me? You heard what l said. Get the fuck out of my way. Fuck you, nigger. What you wanna do? Wanna die? Hey! Hey! Hey! Relax. Hey, man. Who are you? Who are you with? You don't know who l am, man?

We gonna talk later. We got your bitch-ass. What's wrong with you? Let that shit go. Fuck that nigger. You see gangsters? Gangsters? They go to jail. Time of the street thug? That shit's over. Done. You will never ever see anyone from my crew wearing saggy pants and the oversized shirt. The only thing missing are floppy shoes and the red noses, fucking clowns, See, this is a business. Alright? Like the military uses camouflage to blend into their surroundings? Our camouflage are suits, conducting ourselves like gentlemen. Keeping the violence to an absolute minimum, Cal. l'm watching you, homey. Reach out. Apply these principles to your operation, l guarantee you the era of prosperity will be here for years to come. Hear ye, hear ye, mother fuckers. Cheers. Drink up! Baby, pour my man some more drink. Okay, baby. Thank you, sweetheart. Everything that we've been dreaming about l was telling you about that shit Hey, Cal! Hey! l let this shit go once. What's up, nigger? What's up, nigger? What are you?

You need to deal with this shit. Why the fuck do l need to deal with it? 'Cause you broke the bottle over his head. He was a bitch! Well, take this bitch to the swamps. Fuck! Go ahead, handle it, Cal. We appreciate your hospitality we'll get this cleaned up. Thanks a lot, boss man. l'll do it to keep the peace. But this shit is fucked up. l'll do it. Just help me get him in the back seat. After that little glitch, things went exactly according to plan, making money hand over fist. We had everything we wanted: money, houses, cars, and the women, oh, the women would do anything just to be in our world. We were young, rich, and unstoppable, Since Cal was running the business so well l started spending less and less time in the hood and more time with my family. Got to the point where l hardly even seen the demon anymore, Hey, look, my mom collects these. ls that cool, Mommy? Yeah, look. Look, Daddy. Grrr. Norman, put that back. l'm gonna get yah. l'm gonna get Daddy. Stop it! Okay? I ust take that off. You might rip it -or something. Sorry. Can we go see the motorcycles?

A pleasure having the king's son on my bike. Dad, what are you a king of? The streets haven't been the same since you taken over, my brother. lt's definitely a pleasure. Come on, Iet's go. ls that your lady, too? You don't know me, you made a mistake. Okay? Yeah, you got that. You got that. You the king. Come on, Iet's go, son. What was that about? He thought he knew me. Then why did he? That's all ! What's up, Cal? Shit. We made the streets flourish like this. We paid you every fucking month! And now you want more money? You might as well put a gun to our head. l'd rather not. Well, if it's on, it's on. Cal let me talk to Hector. Your boy needs to Iearn some respect. Maybe. But like me, he said we had a deal.

The most evil entity known to God or man. You can't just turn that shit off. The floodgates of hell are open So whet her l'm with you or not l still have to do his will.

It wasn't them. You killed all those bosses and everything just fell into place. That was brilliant, Taz. l just wanted to do like you did. l gotta go. # Swing low # # Sweet chariot # # Comin' for to Carry me home # # Swing low # # Sweet chariot # # Comin' for To carry me home ## Cal! No! No! ! Cal! ! Where you going, mother fucker? Fuck! You're not real. l'm real enough to make you kill. Mm-hm. l made you kill Eddie. Frankie. That Stanley, who by the way, is still in the trunk And then there's your boy, Cal. Oh, yeah. Double bless 'em. He really Ioved you, And how about poor little Tia? Oh, you don't remember that, huh? All that little girl wanted to do was love you. l make you see what l want you to see. And l make you do what l want you to do. And you have the audacity to say l'm not real? Ha! l'm as real as it gets. Your whole damn life is one big tragedy! Son, you dysfunctional. You had to create a mother fucker like me to protect you. Just like your daddy said. l told you l ain't raisin' no punk. The punk is exactly what you became. Until l came along. Until De'Sha came along. Then nobody fucked with Taz. Yeah, you kept me hidden all these years but then l had to come out! Get out of my fucking head! l'm your daddy. l'm just fuckin' with ya. And l'm always gonna be fuckin' with ya. Because l like to fuck with people. So l'm always gonna fuck with ya. Are you okay? Amanda! Amanda! ! Amanda, baby, baby! Oh my God. l killed everybody. It was me. l fucked up. What are you talking about? You gotta get out of here, baby. He's gonna kill you too. Who? What are you talking about? My Dad. He came back as a demon or me. l don't fuckin' know! Taz. Your daddy's dead. You're just upset because No, that was me! You're really scaring me. You're covered in blood. Not my blood. lt's Cal's. He made me kill Cal. Daddy? Don't let him see me like this! Go up to your room! Mommy and Daddy are just talking. Whatever is going on, l can help you. Baby, listen to me. You gotta get Norman and get the fuck out of here. Why, Taz?? l love you! ! l'm not going anywhere until you tell me why? Baby. l'm a drug dealer. One of the biggest drug dealers on the Florida coast. And -l kill people. A lot of people. And 30 miles from here, l got another house with a girlfriend named Tia. l killed her too. And l was the one who dug up my dad's remains. And that's the dead body of one of my drug lords in the trunk of my car. Baby, the demon in my head, he makes me do things so listen to me. Get Norman and get the fuck outta here! Now, okay? Go! Go!! Go. Uh-uh-uh. Now what the fuck did you do that for? You told her everything. Now you have to kill her and your son. No. Mm-hm. You have to. She knows everything. Fuck you! No! Fuck you! Wasn't my fault that you told her everything. Now l'm a-give you a option. You can go in there, put one in the back of their heads, painless, or you know how l work. No. # Swing low # # Sweet chariot # You're not gonna hurt them. # Comin' fo' to Carry me home # Amanda, go! Fuck! ! Daddy? No! ! # Comin' fo' to carry me home # Now my son will grow up without a father, without the proper guidance, He'll always wonder ''What if my dad was here?'' l'm sure one day Amanda will find someone eJse. She's a good woman, so she'll probably find a good man, And they'll raise my son without me, But I know nobody will ever Iove them like l did, And under different circumstances, we could've been so happy, But l guess we'll never know the answer to that, 'Cause l wasn't strong enough to break the cycle, Are you?
