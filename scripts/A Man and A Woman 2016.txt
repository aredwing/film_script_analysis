I was just wondering what song it is the Jong-hwa sings all the time? It's from a TV commercial in Korea. OK. Good bye! Go... go... Hurry to Loan Loan King There's a car coming. What is it, Jong-hwa? I was afraid you might get hurt. Mom is sorry, okay? Mom is sorry. Yes, sorry. Mom is sorry. Mom is sorry. Mom is sorry. Kids who went to the camp said it's great. You'll have fun. I'm worried you'll like it so much you won't come back. I love you. Speedy Loan Loan King Please... I'm afraid not. You have to follow our rules. I'll just watch from a distance. I won't get in your way. Yes... But there's no point to this camp, if parents comes along. You just have to trust us and let us take care of him I promise. I won't be in your way. My son needs me with him. If you're this concerned, then maybe you should take him home with you. Pardon? Think about the reason you came all the way here. No interest for first two months regardless of credit rating Excuse me. Do you have a light? Thank you. You're from Korea, right? Yes. Is the camp far from here? It's near Tampere. It'll take 3 to 4 hours. You're really okay with this? Yes. Anyway... You thanked me already. Are you sure we're going in the right direction? Yes. You don't talk much. Not really. It's over there. It's dangerous. No, it's not. You can come. Let's go to the camp. Across this lake? We need to get to the kids. We can go by car, but let's try this way. Just kidding. Let's go back now. We're not seeing the kids? It's okay. I've seen where they are. Your coffee. Only one cup? I don't drink coffee because of my stomach. But all they have to eat are sandwiches. Coffee is enough. I think you should eat something warm. That would be nice, but we'd better hurry. Shall we? How about finding a place to eat first? My treat. You drove all this way. This kind of food don't suit me. My tastes are too Korean. I like soybean paste and that sort of thing. So when I go abroad, I carry around red-pepper paste. Do you have it with you? Why? May I have it? Is it good? Yes. So you've been here two years. Is life better here? Well, it's alright. It took some time getting used to it. But life is the same everywhere. What? What kind of answer is that? Vague and thoughtless. I mean, it's nice. Quiet and clean. Lots of snow... The road's blocked, we need to wait. Until when? It has to stop snowing first, so they don't know yet. What shall we do? You can probably catch a train at Tampere. Let's try that. And you stay here alone? I guess. It's a common thing here. Then I'll wait with you. It might take really long. It's alright, we're near the camp anyways. I'll bet the kids are doing better than we are. So did your girl get better living here? Well, yes and no. - Another vague answer. - No, I mean it. You can't see progress on the outside. Depression isn't cured easily. Oh, I thought she was like my son, being at the same school. The condition of my son is... really quite bad. Since coming here, I check the time constantly. I've lost all sense of if it's day or night. I've been there, too. - You're up. - Hi... Why are you up so early? I thought I'd take a walk. We walked quite a bit, are you okay? I'm fine. The place I work is by a mountain. So every day I walk up and down the hill. Which mountain? Mt. Namsan. You can call it a mountain, too. Look. I think it's a sauna. Are you okay? Is it okay to just come in? Don't know. Someone's just been here. A sauna deep in the forest... People here love saunas. They say Finns build themselves saunas before houses. Even 100 years ago, women gave birth in saunas. They even have a legend about 'Saunatonttu', an elf living in the sauna. If people are naughty here, the elf gets angry and... Sorry. What were you talking about? About... the elf in the sauna. I woke up this morning, and I was alone. I thought I'd fall apart if my son wasn't by my side. But strangely, I felt calm. I haven't felt that before... Take care. Wait. I don't even know your name. It's me. Hey... Did I wake you up? Sorry. Today is Sunday. Is something wrong? No, I just called. Hi. My feet... ice... Home... Your feet are cold? Yes, let's go home. - My feet... - Poor Jong-hwa's feet are cold? My feet... ice... No interest for first two months regardless of credit rating Dial 8282 Regardless of credit rating Dial 8282 Speedy Loan Loan King Hurry to Loan Loan King He seems to be calmer. How was it there? Okay. - Heard it's freaking cold. - Yeah, it is. But it's nice. Quiet and clean. Lots of snow. We have quite a lot here, too. It's different, really. What's so different? It's just... different. 8 MONTHS LATER With this high ceiling, it feels too big. It seems that way because of the glass. But the mood totally changes after sunset. How many guests were you thinking? About 200 to 300? What do you think? I like the open space, but with a square shape the runway and seating will be hard to arrange in an interesting way. Shall we keep looking? There's not much time. Finding a place with glass walls won't be easy. And if you think about parking, there wouldn't be better options in Seoul for a fashion show venue. Hello, Teacher. I want to see how it looks like in the evening. - I went to Jong-hwa's school. - So? He tore up his classmates' textbooks. Thank god he didn't hit anyone. Did you pay them? I sent them the money and gift certificates. Called all of them to apologize. Problem solved then. How about transferring out of Gangnam district? Schools near here are more difficult, and the parents are picky. Look, Ms. Lee Sang-min. You think that's the real issue here? Ordinary schools will all be the same. But we could at least try. I told you not to insist on an ordinary school. Special schools in Korea aren't bad. But special schools... We need to face reality. From an objective view, this is vanity. Great, you know its name! Crabs walk sideways like this... There are so many! Which animal is your favorite? - Hello! - Yes? Hello. What brings you here? Pardon? What are you doing here? I was... passing by. I had business near here. CEO Lee Sang-min. I didn't expect that. You mean the work I do doesn't suit me? I just didn't see you as a CEO type. What exactly does a CEO look like? I didn't mean to... It's okay. It's just a title. I'm hired to manage the boutique. The real owner is someone else. Her? Yes. Are you back for good? Yes... and no. Guess you got well. You said you don't drink coffee because of your stomach. You remember that... The display team is here. - Shall I tell them to wait? - Yes. You must be busy. Go ahead. It's not a coincidence, is it? 50/50. It's nice to see you. It's a little distracting because of the reflection. Then how about taking out some pendants? IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU TOO. KIM KI-HONG What do you think? Or should we take out all of them? This is so heavy... Where's Yoo-rim? Sleeping? Yeah. You working? Need to change the layout. Sena's giving you a hard time? You're friends, she can go easy on you. Does she have to play the client? The wine was on sale. - You want some? - Sure. Did you accept that job? I met them today and asked for more time. Need to think about it. Anyway I need to finish Sena's gallery first... Are you okay? This opener sucks. I'll do it. Leave it. I'll shower first. Don't drink without me. Why do we feel stress? The bottom line is there's only one reason. We want something, but because of inner or outer obstacles, we can't get it... and we perceive a feeling of discomfort. IT'S KIM KI-HONG. CAN WE TALK NOW? Jong-hwa! No, Jong-hwa! That's not for drinking! It's dirty! Are you okay? Let me handle it. Enough, Jong-hwa. Let's stop it. My baby will catch a cold. Let's dry your body. Oh no, Jong-hwa. Let's stop. It's dirty. Jong-hwa! Stop, Jong-hwa please! Now my son can outfight me. I looked through the pictures you sent. Is there any place more casual? I'm on it. Don't worry. Mr. Kim from Busan's on hold. Will you take it? Oh the second brand? How's it going? I'll go to Busan to present it myself. Good. Thanks! Hello. Hello. Hello... Were you waiting for me? You can say that. You could've called. I texted you a few days ago. But you didn't reply so... I'm sorry, I forgot. - Have you had lunch? - Not yet. I know a nice place. Want to go? You need to eat anyway. Lunch is ready. You said it's a nice restaurant. Isn't it nice? Quiet, nice view. Why isn't anyone here? They went out for lunch. One person needs to stay on site. Here. Your favorite, soybean stew. So this is what you do. I didn't expect that. Meaning the work I do doesn't suit me? Right. Just kidding. Oh, it's good. Do you like your job? I chose it because I liked it. But now, sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. It's your habit. Giving vague answers. Is it? It's amazing. To have a place like this in a container building. The containers are narrow. So we extended the deck here like a center garden. Isn't it a little chilly? You're warmer now. So what's the progress of the construction? About 70% done. Did you have lunch, Ki-hong? When do we pick up the jewelry? The carving will be done this week. I'll go this weekend. We'd better hurry. The boss is arriving next week. Yes, ma'am. I should've gotten it earlier. Ran, how's the presentation file coming? I'm working on it now. It'll be done tomorrow. Okay. - I'm going. - Okay, bye. I'll wait downstairs. Are you staying? I think I should leave too. It's quite late, right? I'm sorry. Jong-hwa fell asleep in the fitting room again. Got it. - See you tomorrow. - See you. Shall we grab a bite? - At this hour? - Why not? I'm here to shop for clothes. Am I too late? We're closed. I see. Shall I come another time? What if you showed up and I weren't here? Then I'd go home. It's true. It ended at my father. - It wasn't passed down to me. - You're stuttering. I just have a hand tremor. Hi Mom. We'll grill the beef and stuff. You know he can cook. Why do you always make him do everything? - Hello? - Mom, I'll call you back. Where's your daughter? In her room. Why not have her eat with us? She's not comfortable with strangers yet. She's a shy girl. Just like you. Should I walk naked around the neighborhood? Stop, I brought my girlfriend! - This is really pretty. - Isn't it? They have great furniture in Finland. Like Alvar Aalto. Why didn't you ship some back? I wanted to, but I couldn't. Things were so uncertain. Why, are you going back to Finland? Giving it some thought. But I thought you'll join Han's company. You should decide quick. My gallery is almost done. - I also... - Right? That precious gallery's tied him up for months. I thought he came back to Seoul for my sake. But it turns out it was for your gallery. Or was it just an excuse for something else between you two? I suppose that's possible. That's a bad joke. How do you say "Cheers" in Finnish? It's fine. I have a meeting early tomorrow, that's all. Don't worry, just keep up with the gallery work. Let's go! Thank you for the dinner. - Take care. - Bye. That looks dangerous. Moon-ju! Come down, you'll get hurt. You come up, too! Moon-ju! Such a coward! Come down, I said! Ki-hong. It's my sweet girl! Oh... you peed. Don't go! I'll be right back. If you want to see a whale you'll have to just ignore the roses. And all their pink and all their sweet and all their wild and all their waving. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'RE DOING OK. DELETE Yoo-rim, what are you doing? Moon-ju! Moon-ju! You tired? You haven't slept at all. I'm alright. I'll take her at my house when she leaves hospital. Yoo-rim, too. Since she wants to stay by her mom. What should I do? Got to take care of my girl. Don't blame yourself, it's not the first time. Her mood swings and victim mentality... She got married too young, and depended too much on you. She could never grow up. How could you forget this? That presentation caused us so much trouble. Come on. I'll drive you to the station. One minute. What are you doing here? Did you eat breakfast? I'm hungry. Sorry, I don't have time. I have a train to catch. - Going where? - Busan. For work. I'll give you a ride. To Busan? Why not? I gave you a ride once before. You don't have to today. Then just to the station. Sang-min! You look terrible. You didn't even shave. What's up? Do I look that bad? Maybe because I skipped breakfast. - Don't skip breakfast. - Yup. And shave, too! KIM KI-HONG You want something to eat? Here you go. So laid-back. Me? You seem to have nothing to worry about. Do I look that way? Do you work at all? The construction is almost complete. Then you're going back to Finland? I wish I could, but I don't think I can. There you go again. I can't go back because of you. I wasn't sleeping. You even snored. Go back to sleep. You're too far away. Don't want to bother you. You'd better go now. I want to see you off this time. Okay then. What are you drinking for? Celebrating... we passed the final building inspection. Sorry, I should've taken care of it. Forget it. We took care of it anyhow. I assumed you couldn't make it. You look terrible. Well, that's to be expected. I don't know... why everything in my life is so vague. You realize it now? You've been that way since you were little. I have a date. Gotta go. Hey... something's different about you. It's not just because of your wife, is it? This is our first big investment in the fashion business, so we're depending on you for a great result. Money types like us should support artists, shouldn't we? - Ms. Lee will do it great. - We have to have good results, seriously. Take the call, a busy person like you. Busy? A little. Ah... Hello? Did you drink? Yes... a little. Get some rest. You looked really tired. I just... wanted to hear your voice. Okay, then. You're warm. I wish I could sleep like this. Go ahead. What time is it now? The watch... No. It's better not to know. I like this place. Excellent choice. Thank god you like it. I had so much trouble finding it. How's Dad doing? The same. Says he feels anxious after giving up smoking. He wants to leave New York because of terrorism. He hates everywhere. LA's too boring, and he's scared of earthquakes in San Francisco. What are we going to do with him? He could come here. Seoul? No way, he's scared of the war. That's our Dad... Hello! So, they wanna change rehearsal schedule. Push back in an hour. Is that okay? OK You need anything? No. Everything's fine. - Alright. - Yeah. Are you two serious? My relationships are always serious, every time. But if you mean marriage, then... not yet. I don't think I could live like you. What do you mean, live like me? Happily married. Aren't you? She talks quite a lot to the kitty. Do they connect in some way? Curious. She looks good, right? Yoo-rim. You do, too. Still, I'm locked up. Why do you think so? Who's locking you up? You must think you know me well, but you don't. What do you think, Sang-min? Good. A little more glamour wouldn't hurt. Hun... gry. You said 'hungry'? You know what I'm saying? OK. I'm sorry. Sang-min, let's eat first. Let's resume after lunch. - Keep those outfits. - Yes. - Put things in order. - Yes. How can I help you? I'm looking for Mr. Kim Ki-hong. He's not here now. What do you need? I'm a friend of his. I was just passing by. He won't be in today. I see. And your name is? I'll call him later. Excuse me! Did you happen to know... that he's going through some trouble lately? You didn't. Well... His wife is very ill. Which clothes go with these? These ones. Or something like this with a similar tone could work. Your phone is ringing. - These are good. - Really? Then we'll change them all. What about this? That one goes with... Yes. Can you talk? Go ahead, please. Hello? - It's strange. - What's strange? You sound strange. And you look worried. Come out for a sec. I can't, I'm busy. You came to see me earlier. You won't talk to me? Let's just have sex. What's this about? You like me, and I like you too. That's enough. Why bother talking? Sang-min! I just want to talk to you. What's there to talk about? Why are you so angry? I need a cigarette. Can you buy some for me? I'm not angry at you. At myself... I'm angry at myself. WE SHOULD END IT HERE. LET'S END WHEN IT'S BEST. Let's go, Jong-hwa! Hello. Be careful! How could you leave like that? I'm sorry, but please don't call me again. If you're really sorry, tell me in person. I can't end it like this. It's better to end it now, before it gets too hard. Was it nothing to you? What can we do? We don't have a choice. INCOMING CALL: LEE HA-JUNG Hello, Ha-jung. Hi, are you on your way? What are you talking about? I'm waiting for Jong-hwa. He went in a while ago. I've been waiting here at the entrance. Wait... You haven't met him yet? No, did you really see him come in here? Just before... I'm sure he went in. Where is he then? Let me look for him. I'll go now. Call me if you find him. I'm almost there. Did you find him? The instructors and I searched every floor but I don't think he's in the building. Then... what do... He could be outside. I'll go out and look for him. Please do that. I'll look for him on the way. Don't worry, he'll be alright. Should we go a bit further? Look! Jong-hwa! Jong-hwa! What are you doing here in the rain? Let's go home. Come with Mommy. - Drifting away. - What? Drifting away. Drifting away. Give me his shoe. Sang-min! I found your shoe! My shoe... My shoe... - Mommy found it! - My shoe... Let's go home now. Years ago, while playing by the sea his shoe came off and was swept away by the waves. He must've remembered it. A memory hard for a kid to forget... You found it for him. Now he can forget it. Some memories are better when forgotten. The sea. The sea. Sea... The sea... You want to go to the sea? Let's go again sometime. The sea... sea... The sea... The sea... Thank you. I'm glad you were with me. You're not answering? You're not answering? They can call back. It seems whenever we meet, we're traveling. It's true. Shall we not go back? Sure. I'm not kidding. We really are in trouble. What did you draw? - Shoe. - Hold on, Jong-hwa. Why is a shoe in the sea? It drifted away. I see, it drifted away. But whose shoe is it? Despite getting so soaked, he seems to be fine. That's a relief. Why go to the sea, all of a sudden? He wanted to go. Well done. Sometimes you need to be impulsive. This is heart-shaped. Right! How many are there? One, two, three... Dad is home. Here you are. Are you done eating? Really? Then I'll take that. Did you eat? I made pasta. You want some? Yoo-rim, brush your teeth. It's a simple one I made with the things in the fridge. You know... I like you a lot. Maybe too much. I needed a man who loves me as a woman. I didn't want a guardian. But with you I feel like a patient. I know... I'm a bit weird. And you, staying by my side... The thought just came to me. Have I ever understood my husband? It must've been so hard on him. He must've been so lonely. Daddy's fine. Check if it's correct. One, two, three, four. That's right. Much better, right? Are the earrings too much? We'll change it later. Is this the right order? Doesn't it overlap? Make a fierce look! Good. It's me. Can we talk? Yes. You must be busy. Today's the big day, so it's been hectic. How have you been? Ma'am. Your sister's looking for you. Sorry. I'll call you later. I miss you. Let's meet after the show. It'll be quite late. Is that okay? I'll wait. Good job, everyone! Your sister was tired, so she went back to the hotel. I know. Her boyfriend is quite cute. Though I'm not really into foreign guys. I'm glad the show went well. - Aren't you? - Yeah, me too. Take her stuff. I'll drive you home. - I'll manage, go ahead. - Alright then. Let's go! Take care. Good job today! Thank you, good night! Shall we call mom? Look, Jong-hwa. Mommy's over there! Jong-hwa... Surprised to see us? The show finished early? Jong-hwa, if we were any later, we would have missed her. What brings you here? Jong-hwa's been missing you all day. So we decided to take a drive and pick you up. You must be tired. Let's bring Mommy home. You're not coming? Be careful, son. So your busy stretch is over now? Jong-hwa, let's take a trip with mom, shall we? I'M SO SORRY, TONIGHT I CAN'T. What? You're going out? Yes. Going where? I need to see someone. At this hour? I see... It seems you have a lover? Yeah. I can't live without him. You don't have to forgive me. Even I can't forgive myself. Lee Sang-min. Sit down here for a sec. Let's talk it through. What on earth... - I'm sorry, really. - Lee Sang-min! ONE YEAR LATER You want me to come for no reason? Does it have to be for work? Just come and have fun. New York is too cold. I'll go when it warms up. Dad's worried about you. Living all alone. You've pulled yourself together? Alright, let's talk again. Bye, sis. It would catch more light, if they touched the traverse. Yes, but also disrupt the flow of light in the room. That's true. Coffee? Yeah, let's get some pulla as well. Watch out. How are you? How many people? Ah... Where is the toilet? Toilet? Just around the corner over there. Give me a bite. Hello. It's me. Yes. Hello? Sang-min? I'm listening. I can't hear you clearly. Hello? Do you hear me well? I do. Don't you? Hello? Is she out of country? - Hello? You hear me? - Hello? Jae-seok. Do you hear me? Hello? It's better now. How are you? Okay. Jong-hwa, wait. I'll put Jong-hwa on. Son, it's Mom. No interest for first two months regardless of credit rating... Dial 8282 Speedy Loan Loan King I love you, too. I love you. I'm sorry... We can... We can go now. Thank you. Huh? For what? Just saying. Do you want one? Yes, please. Thank you. What time is it? I don't have a watch... One moment. Oh, no. It's OK. I don't need to know. It's better not to know.
