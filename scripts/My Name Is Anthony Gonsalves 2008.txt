You have to struggle a lot in this line! You tell me! I will just make the call! No, bhai! I am there! I will manage it on my own! As you wish! But you need to use some power.. ..to make your luck shine. I will use it, bhai! I will use the power of my toil! Go ahead! Very good! Refill! How are you? Anthony.. you didn't tell me you want to become a hero! Let it be! Do you want to become one? I want to become an actor! Look, Anthony! I didn't become a cameraman in a day! Earlier I was a light man. Then I said I wanted to be a cameraman. Gradually I became one! You have to say it! First to yourself and then to others! Now say it! I am a star! I want to be a hero! Here? First say it here! Then you can say it there. Say it. I am a star! I want to be a hero! Do you want to be the hero of a silent movie? Roar like a lion! I am a star! I will be a hero! Say it!

I have fever! I have fever here too! Look! The mosquito bit me! I need 100 rupees to see the doctor. Does the mosquito want to die that he will bite you? There is no blood in you! Only liquor is filled in your body! Give me 50 rupees! I will not go to the doctor. I will buy my medicine from the medical store. No chance! No chance, Michael! You can't fool me! Anthony, its rainy season! I will die, Anthony! Is this your friendship? Did you forget? I showed you a movie for free when you were small! Don't make me emotional, Michael! Don't make me emotional! You get a tip of 200 rupees in the pub! That's why you have forgotten Michael! Enough of your drama! Stop this drama! Give me 10 rupees! - No! I will light the mosquito coil at home and go to sleep! Give me 10 rupees! Please! Please, Anthony! God bless you! Thank you! If I found out that you used this money for drinks.. ..then you just watch! You watch, Michael! You just watch! Anthony, what will I get in 10 rupees? I will get! I will get cheap liquor! I will get to drink today! I am coming! Will you have more beer? If you drank then you will have to use the bathroom. And for that you will have to take sir's permission. Sir is with Sikandar. Important meeting. Gang's meeting. Neither your work nor my work! He has brains! Let him use it! He has brains. That's why he can sit with sir! And here you.. You didn't even come to know when Sikandar.. ..became the right hand of Murtuza sir. Right hand! Sir eats with his right hand! You know what he does with his left hand, don't you? You are drunk! Yes! I am drunk! That's why I speak the truth! Maqsood! You are a courageous man! But that Sikandar.. he is smart! And you can never trust smart people! How can I trust you? You can't! Nobody is trustworthy! Sikandar will go places. I too will prosper. But what will you do, Maqsood? You will work under Sikandar! Tell me! Maqsood, nobody gives you company in death. You have to die alone. You too will die alone. They must be drunk! They must be joking! Anthony, you don't be tense! Okay, bhai! Nobody can dare to kill Sikandar! All the big stars in this industry live here. Amitabh Bachchan too? Not just Amitabh Bachchan! I said everybody! How are you? Pappu, get one tea! Anthony! Yesterday morning you were going in haste! Did you get any role? I went in haste. And I came back in haste. Forget it! Look! He is my cousin! Umesh! He came from Kolhapur yesterday! Like you, he too is a big fan of Bachchan! Great! Anthony! Enact like Kalia! I have heard so much about you! No! At times just for time pass! Why are you acting smugly? Come on! Do it once! But you need Pran too along with Kalia! Pran? Paresh-bhai! What happened to him? Today you have crossed your limits, Kalia! Many prisoners tried to flee from.. ..inspector Raghubeer Singh's prison! But what you have achieved, no prisoner has achieved that. Bhim! Bhim! Take him! And tie him with chains from head to toe in such a way.. ..that he can neither flee nor can he try to rebel. Bhim!

Somebody you will tame the elephant! You will ride on it! The whole world will lie at your feet! But the point is.. to be firmly grounded. Hello! You! What are you doing here? I work here! What are you doing here? I have come to give the audition! Are you serious? Why? Can't I become a hero? You can become a hero! But this audition is for a big movie! I know! A big Hollywood company.. ..has come to make a Hindi movie here. I have the information. Yes! And Ms. Barucha is going to direct this movie! So Ms.. She is new? - New? She is a big director! And her previous movie got a Cannes award. In the film festival. New! I understood! Slow movie! It's between you and me. I don't watch such movies. I get bored. But it's okay. I only have to work. Look, Mr.. Anthony! Anthony Gonsalves! Mr. Gonsalves, this is not your street! Where you can enact some hero in front of your friends. See that! - I am looking! There! He has done 3 years acting course. From National School of Drama. And he! He has done RADA! What will he quarrel? I know how to quarrel! Come in my area and see! Not that one! RADA! Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts! From London! He has come to act! There are many talented people here! But remember! Only poor people truly love! The rest lies in destiny! Token number 5 just went in! Your number will come by evening! Ma'am, can't you do something? Something! - Yes! Possible! You should have told me before! I knew that you will do something for me! We are old acquaintances. We met that day. Let it be! 38 is fine! I will manage! People have to struggle a bit. Method, I think is so methodical. I mean it just takes away the naturalist.. the.. The spontaneity from your performance! I absolutely agree with you! That's why I hate actors like Al Pacino, Robert De Neiro.. ..Dustin Hoffman. You know give me an actor like Nicholas Cage! Or Sean Penn. I love Sean Penn! He is God of acting! I just saw a girl here. She gives me signs. But I think she is afraid of somebody. Yes, she is afraid. Yes, she is afraid. Yes, ma'am! Hello! Thank you! Hello! - Good morning! Name! - Anthony! Anthony Gonsalves! You didn't tell ma'am about me? Sorry! No, no! No need to say sorry! You say! We will talk in English. So that my colleagues too understand. Okay. English! You see the coefficient of the linear.. ..just opposition is just a position.. ..by the hemoglobin of the atmospheric pressure of the country! Who is this joker? What is he saying? Ma'am, he has to make a movie in Hindi. So he should know Hindi. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, Mr. Gonsalves! We will talk in Hindi! Now tell me! What experience do you have in acting? Ma'am, my experience is first class. Whenever I act.. my experience is really good. Acting runs in my blood. I am.. She means to say, have you ever acted before? In any movie or TV serial. No, no! I don't like TV medium, ma'am! I am the man of the big screen! I watch movies! That too first day first show on Fridays! Always! Surely you must have done some theatre. In theatre! I don't watch movies on TV! He is talking about working, not watching! Have you ever acted before? What are you talking, ma'am? There is no child in Chapel Road.. ..who has not seen Anthony's acting! You come and ask them! Ask Ria ma'am! Am I right, ma'am! You too saw Kalia's trailer, didn't you? Who can tie somebody? You.. you know this guy? No! No, ma'am! I just happen to be passing by! All right! All right! Never mind! Just get him to read for Anthony! Okay! Yes, ma'am! I will just be back, ma'am! I will be back, sir! Come! - Greetings! Greetings! What are you doing? Will you get me sacked? Why are you so scared? He has no chance! I will give such an audition that you will get a pay rise. Now listen to me! Your character's name is Anthony! Anthony's role! - I will act so well! Now tell the rest to go home! I will tell them! Now listen to me carefully. Ms. Barucha has set William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.. ..in Mumbai's underworld. There are 4 main characters in this movie. Firstly is Julius Caesar himself. Caesar is a big and dangerous don. Nothing can happen without his wish. And his most trustworthy friend is.. Brutus. Brutus is as powerful as Caesar. But he is more dangerous than Caesar. The third one is Casio. He pretends to be a friend. But actually he is jealous of Caesar's success. He is very intelligent. But he needs Brutus's power to compete with Caesar. And Anthony amidst all of them! I understood the story. Now what do I have to do? Excellent! This is the copy of the scene. Enact it. My name is Sikandar! Come on! Come! Maqsood, you too! Brothers.. friends.. Mr. Murtuza! I have not come here to praise Sikandar. I have come to bury him here. A person's vice doesn't leave him even after his death. And his virtue dies with him. Let the same thing happen with Sikandar. Maqsood-bhai told everybody.. ..that Sikandar was selfish. He was a traitor. He was building castles in the air. Maqsood-bhai won't lie. Maqsood-bhai is an honest man. Sikandar never exploited a poor man! He took the hardship of his friend on himself. He slept in the hut so that sir can have a bungalow. If this is not building castle in the air, then what is it? Thanks a lot for calling an ordinary man like me here. And giving me a chance to speak. And to shed two tears on my friend's death. But forgive me. I will shed tears at this traitor's death. Because if Sikandar obligation was nil.. ..still everybody would have been under his obligation. Hello! Anthony! You didn't go home? How can I go? You didn't tell me. Where is the shooting and when? I told you. They will call and let you know. So will I wait for the call the whole day? Tell me honestly. Do I have any chance? You have a chance. But.. - But what? Will I get the role? What can I do, Anthony? I am just an assistant director! Ms. Barucha didn't even ask whether I liked the audition. Did you like it? - She didn't ask me! No, no! I am asking it! Did you like it? It was okay! In fact not bad! Then will I get the role? - Yes! No, no! Nothing is confirmed! Tomorrow we will again see all the auditions! Don't keep me waiting! Tell me honestly! Will I get the role? My dear Anthony! Please understand! audition in the past 3 days! Tomorrow we will come to know whether.. ..you are the chosen one from those 200 guys or not! What, ma'am? I am one in a million! I can see that! I have an idea! I will.. - Look, Anthony! If you bored me, then I will myself.. ..cancel your name from the list! And I will tell Barucha! That you got in fraudulently! What? - I will call you tomorrow. Tomorrow I will ask you. Tell me tomorrow. Okay. I will leave now. Don't get angry. Sorry. Idiot! Bunty! - Yes, sir! Quickly get Bedi's head! Quickly! - I will just get it! Will it work today or not? Who is it? Anthony! How was your audition? It was superb! Everybody was impressed! Everybody said an actor should be like me! Look there! Actors should be like him! What an actor! If somebody wants to become an actor.. ..then he should fall at his feet! Sir. - Got it? What is he doing! Who is he? Anil! - Who is this boy? He is Anthony! I know him! He wants to be an actor! He is a nice boy. - I see! Get me a chair. So you want to be an actor! Yes, sir! I am your big fan! You act so well! It looks so real! It looks easy! But when you actually do it, it's difficult! Difficult! When you do it emotionally then nothing is difficult! Sir, today I too gave an audition. There every actor was trying to be smart! Method acting and God knows what not! I couldn't understand anything, sir! Sir, explain it in simple terms. I see! Have you heard Stanoslovaski's name? Stanoslovaski! Forget it! Russia! Russia country! Yes! I know Russia, sir! I saw James Bond's movie! From Russia with love! He is a famous director in that country. Constantine Stanoslovaski - What? Constantine. Forget it. I will explain in your language. This Russian man has explained acting in simple terms. He said that there are four pillars of acting. You understand pillars, don't you? Yes, sir! Pole! Pole! Fine! He said there are four poles of acting! First pole is concentration. Paying attention. The second pole is observation. Meaning observing people and.. ..understanding their behaviour. You mean to imitate them! No! You should get under the skin of the character. - What? Understanding them! - Yes! I will do it, sir! Will you do it? - Yes! The third pole is imagination. You understand that, don't you? Yes, sir! Dreaming! Am I right? I am an expert in it, sir! Yes! Nowadays everybody is an expert in dreaming! The fourth pole is relaxation. - Meaning relaxing? Not to work? If you won't work, how will you become an actor? Use your brain! If an actor is relaxed then he can concentrate better.. ..observe better, imagine better. Okay! - This is simple, sir! It's simple. And it's not simple also. But to understand the character.. ..to feel his situation.. that's called real acting. In your language it's called getting.. ..under the skin of the character. I will do it, sir! - Will you do it? Now leave. My shot is ready. I will have to go. Okay. Okay, sir. Thank you very much, sir! - Thank you! I will always remember what you told me! - Okay! Thank you, sir! - Bye! Concentration! Observation! Imagination! Relaxation! Concentration! Observation! Imagination! Relaxation! Observation! Concentration! Observation! Relaxation! Concentration! Observation! Concentration! What was the third one? Imagination! I met you and I don't know what happened to my heart. I don't know what happened to my heart. My ignorant heartbeat is craving. I don't know what happened to my heart. I lost my own self. What have you done? There is loneliness in the crowd. On which path am l? Your eyes touched my eyes in such a way. I got so fervent that I lost my solace. There is a strange trance all the time. I don't know what happened to my heart. We both are quiet. But this silence is talking. We are not in our senses. What intoxication is this! We don't know anything. We are so crazy. Now we can't stop our steps in this craziness. Lovely heartbeats in death. I don't know what happened to my heart. I met you and I don't know what happened to my heart. I don't know what happened to my heart. Hello! Hello, Mr. One in a million! Your name has been short listed! What are you saying? I will be there right away! Strange, dear. Well done, Anthony! That was a very, very good audition! Thank you, ma'am! I want you to keep track of the role that you have done. Thank you! Quite complex! I know you have done well today! But Ria needs to give you your lines! Ria! And you need to be disciplined. When did you see him for the last time? Tell me! Sir, thrice. He says twice. And you say thrice. Shall I give you a slap? Hey, come on! Leave! It's such a boring job! What to do? We have to do it! His name was Gupta. I don't know whether he is alive or.. We will search for him until we find the body. When we will find the body.. we will search for.. Search! It's your job to search! And to dispose.. whose job is that? Tell me. Name. Anthony. Work? Sir, he is a waiter. He has nothing to do with all this. Gupta was one of my best officers, Sikandar. He has a family. Two children. His son always asks me, when will papa come! When will papa come! When you and I very well know.. ..that Gupta will never come back! Excuse me, sir! A week, 10 days.. a month. A year, 2 years, 5 years. I will retire after 12 years. I won't spare you. What the police know? I don't know. What Yakub knows? I don't know. Are you a man or what? Say I don't know! Shiraz introduced you to Gupta. Saying that he is Yakub's man. He will give us information about Yakub's gang. Right? Yes, sir! Then you felt that Shiraz and Gupta are playing a game with you. So you killed Gupta. Right? - Yes. Where is Shiraz? Sir, we are trying. We will find him. What do you mean? Will he come by himself? Find him! Find out where he is hiding! This policeman.. what did you say is his name? Khan! Can't you handle him? By giving him bribe. No, sir. He is an honest man. Maqsood, pray! That Gupta's body is never found. If it's found then pray that the police never come to my door. If they come.. then pray that somebody saves you from me. There is still some chance of.. ..the first prayer being accepted. But there is no chance of the third one. I am in a bad plight! I have no penny! Nobody is getting married! Nobody is dying! Nobody is taking birth! God, are You on strike? Don't You care for me? Do You hear me? Or will I have to use a loudspeaker! Fulfil our demands! Fulfil our demands! Fulfil our demands! The one who will confront us, he will perish! Fulfil our demands! Fulfil our demands! Fulfil our demands! Fulfil our demands! Brothers, till the time poor people drink liquor.. I mean till the time they don't get to eat.. ..till then nobody will receive justice in this country! So march forward with me! And say!

What are you thinking? You won't get it for less than 500 rupees. What will I do with this? You keep it! And today I don't even have money! Father's useless bike consumes so much petrol. Anthony! When did I say that I want the money now? Look! I had to pay you 1 00 rupees! Right? That's settled now! And if you give me 1 00 then l.. ..will go and drink in your pub.Okay! Hey! Hey! Hey! Michael! Now don't change your mind! Come on! You are getting late! Come on! Leave quickly! Come on! Come on! Hey stop! No, I don't want to hear anything! And I don't want these excuses! Every actor should have every scene's copy all the time! Understand! But ma'am, I gave the.. ..copies to everybody yesterday! They lost it! I don't care! Now keep 4 copies! Look at all of them! Sitting around! Wiggling their arms, doing nothing! Absolutely nothing! - I am sorry, ma'am! And look at that one flirting with that girl! - Anthony! You are coming now! Sorry, ma'am! Where were you? I.. I had gone to the market, ma'am! Market! Market! - Yes, ma'am! What did you want from the market early in the morning? What I wanted, ma'am.. I went to buy this, ma'am! For you! - For me?

Ria, sorry! What did I know that you will get so angry! She has got a new toy! After 2-4 days she will get bored and leave it! Why are you tense? - Ria! She is hell bent! She will leave it! This woman will kill me! I.. - Ria! Hold this! What will I do with this? Ria! Ria! To tell you the truth.. today I got late because of you. Shahrukh's movie! - Yes! All the shows were houseful!

Anthony, I want to talk to you urgently! You sit in my car. I will drop you. - Okay, ma'am! Anthony, you can't go in the car! Why? - Why? You had brought somebody's scooter! You will have to return it! No, no! There is no tension! Ma'am, Father Briganza uses the scooter only thrice in a year. On Christmas, New Year and Easter. I will return it tomorrow. No tension. Fine. You come with me. - Yes, ma'am! Bye, Ria! Anthony should be just like you! Very normal! Very real! He can be a bit more stylist than you! But not at all fake! - What do you mean? I mean I have found my Anthony! So here! You mean me! - Yes! Keep it safely! And work hard on the preparation! I will work really hard! I will tell you something, ma'am! - Yes. Please don't mind! That you want to leave! And you want to go back and tell Ria! How do you know? For God sake, Anthony! Give me some credit! I am your director after all! Now go! Run along! Go! - Thank you, ma'am! Take care! Bye! See you tomorrow! Okay, ma'am! See you tomorrow! I have reached home! I live on the 7th floor! There? - Yes! Will you have coffee? Not today! Today is the best day of my life!

For sure I will come! Ria, will you offer me coffee tomorrow? Anytime! So I will come tomorrow. Don't cancel it. - No. I will meet you tomorrow. Bye. - Bye. Sikandar-bhai! Sikandar-bhai! Hold the head! Carry it! Carry it! Greetings, brother. Pappu, how are you? - I am fine, brother. - Brother Yakub? He is waiting for you. - Is it? - Yes. - Let's go. This is your passport and ticket. And this is good luck. The flight is scheduled at half past 5, brother. What do you want to do till then? to do shopping. - Yes. I have to bid Seth farewell. - Yes. And I want to meet my 'Umrao Jaan'. Brother Shiraj will you meet 'Umrao Jaan' like this? First shave yourself. Or what? No one is going to give me any attention like this. Start. All your friends must be very happy especially Sikandar Bhai. Yes, he is very happy. Maqsood. Rascal, I am here. - Let go of me! I will beat the rascal. The scoundrel. I will stab the rascal. Maqsood! Don't touch him. Don't touch him. - Make that rascal understand. Explain. Come. Come. You don't listen. I have told you so many times not to come inside like this. Go away from here. Who knows on which tree sprits love, friendship and loyalty? Who knows where truth and loyalty lives? Sikandar Bhai you were the one to teach me all facts of life. And today you are telling me to forget everything. Yes, I am telling you to forget. What are you saying, Bhai? To forget the one without whom I cannot even eat. What have you seen? We do what you have seen all the time. You are a good man. I am not a good man. But you should become a good man. That's why I kept you away from all this. You will not know, think or speak.. ..to anyone about business. Open your mouth. Say your lines Anthony. Why are you stuck? You are getting stuck there repeatedly. From where has this Sikandar come from in between the scene? I am sorry, madam. Now come on. Take it from the top. Come on move your brush here fast. A forest has erupted here. Place it here. Clean shave me completely. I want the special shave. Take a good blade and.. So Shiraj you must be thinking that would have been.. ..better of I had shaved in Dubai. All right, now I understand. Party. Right? You must have drunk too much alcohol at the party. And your Sikandar Bhai must have forced you to drink. No wonder. That's why you are taking his name all the time. Don't blabber uselessly. You don't know anything. Anthony, I just know that you are worried. And I can't see you worried like this. - Why? What do you mean why? I don't like it. - But why? What why? You are my friend and I like you. So I don't like to see you like this. You need so much time to understand this. I don't need time understand. But I need time to make you speak. Shut up! Has no one come to fetch his body? - No, sir. Family? - He has one, sir. But his father had disowned him years ago. What do we do now sir? Shiraj was the only man to take us to those people. Chauhan, the Almighty's law is more efficient than ours. We will find some way out. Some is bound to speak. Then? Then you woke up. Why are you shaking your head? Just say that you had a nightmare. It was not a dream father. Not a dream. Have mercy on him. Have mercy on your child. Oh my God. This is the 3rd time they had robbed the church donation box. I just want to meet him once. I will teach him such a lesson that he will remember. Father, people even try to cheat God. The one who can betray himself can betray anyone. Not everyone is like you. What will I do now, father? You have done hat you had to do. You came to God and spoke. Now he will do the needful. Now continue doing what you used to do before. Dream. Your old dream. Your dream to shoot and girls. If is dream that then you will say, Anthony.. ..you have a dirty mind. - Oh no, Anthony. You never had a dirty mind and you never have one either. You are God's child. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Anthony, how many times have I told you. Anthony is not a hero. He doesn't show styles. Anthony is real. What? Madam, this is my real style. I always sit like this with outstretched legs. Anthony, you mean to say you have never sat with your legs together. Actually madam. I don't like sitting like this. When I was small is used to sit like this only. But don't worry madam. I will pick it up like this for you. What he does? Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. The one who comes to my dreams. The one who has stolen my heart. Do you realize it? I can't live without you for even a moment. The one who comes to my dreams. The one who has stolen my heart. Do you realize it? I can't live without you for even a moment. Without you. Without you. Without you. Yes, without you. Without you. Without you. Without you. Without you. What a pained heart I had. I was engrossed. And my heart started getting restless. What a pained heart I had. I was engrossed. And my heart started getting restless. Why do I find the moon and stars boring these days? Without you. Without you. Without you. Yes, without you. Without you. Without you. Without you. Without you. Without you. All my moments turn into my enemies alone and sad.. All my moments turn into my enemies alone and sad.. I get unrest even in rest. Everything is there, but something I still lacking. Without you. Without you. Without you. Without you. Yes, without you. Without you. Without you. Without you. Without you. The one who comes to my dreams. The one who has stolen my heart. Do you realize it? I can't live without you for even a moment. Without you. Without you. Without you. Yes, without you. Without you. Without you. Without you. Farida Khanam sings great exactly like butter in butter chicken. Don't insist to leave today. Just keep on sitting beside me. - What uncle? You have called us urgently and.. ..here you are talking about Farida Khanam. Talk about work. - You have started talking like your father My sister has married into a lowly manner. He is just a thorn, Seth. All this is beyond their comprehension. Tell me, Sikandar. - Yes. Why there is so much difference between you and them? Because you have raised me, Seth. And they have been raised by your money. But I am tired of raising now. Now you look after your friends. You wanted to talk about work with me. Then listen. I am going for Haj (pilgrimage). Sikandar will take all decisions in future. And you will respect all his decisions. Riyaz, do you hear? Yes, I am listening. But l am not able to understand. Maqsood is the heir to this post. He is your nephew. And blood is after all blood. Even my bed bugs have blood. So what do I do? Should I give them the mattress? And I have just announced my decision. I have not asked for your advice. Why are you sitting silently, Sikandar? Seth, don't separate us. When you there.. - Sikandar. Life is uncertain. I want to be Haji Murtuza from Murtuza Seth before dying. Remove this post from between me and God, dear. Congratulations on your Haj, Seth. Not now. Let me go and return. If you speak. With God's grace it will be done. Congratulations on your Haj, uncle. - Hey. Congratulations, Seth. Oh yes, congratulations. Give me a coke. Your cycle. - Hey! Thief! Wait! He has taken my cycle. Hey stop! Where are you running to, rascal? Careful. Are you new? Uncle, has the second thrown you out too? Correct yourself. You are too old now. Mr. Sunil, how are you? Did you recognize me? Michael. From aunt's den. - Come now. - I know big people. to lowly constables, understand? I used to talk to inspector level directly. - Is it? - Yes. Go inside directly. Go. Why are you getting so angry, sir? I am talking politely and you.. Weren't you taught how to talk with the customers? I am your customer if l have come to your shop. All right. Vishwas Bhai. So Michael, you thought l won't find you after you fooled me. Brother, don't touch me. I have my contacts. I will tell Sikandar Bhai. Don't touch me. You are threatening me. Vishwas Bhai. What is happening here? Who is this new convict? - An old fraud, sir. He steals manhole covers and even other high level frauds. There is nothing that happen between Khar and Bandra.. ..which this rascal doesn't know about. - Listen. Yes, sir. - What do you know about the Murtuza gang? About Sikandar? First take me out, sir. Please. Tell me what you have to say, fast. I don't have the time. Did you hear? Sir doesn't have time. - 5 minutes. That's it. I need the 5 minutes just to think. Sir. I will tell you everything, sir. I will say everything. Aunt. Anthony's confession. Sikandar's basement. I will tell you the entire truth. What are they doing early in the morning? Good God, Anthony! You saw a body in Sikandar's basement. - Yes, father. I saw the 3 taking out a body from the basement. Maqsood Bhai, Riyaz Bhai and also Sikandar Bhai. Sir, I have told you everything. Why did you slap me now? Because you stole from the church. Understand? We will be deciding together. The question is not what is right and what is wrong. The question is.. The gang's loyalty.. Anthony you have forgotten your lines again. Sorry, madam. - Riya, please. - This is the line. The question is for who our loyalty is for. For the gang or for truth? Read it carefully once. - No, I am ready. The question is for who our loyalty is for. For the gang or for.. For whom the gang's loyalty is for. The question is that.. For God's sake Anthony. You have forgotten everything. I am sorry madam. That.. - There is no point here. Let's just break for lunch. And post lunch I want scene 45. Just keep your focus. - Anthony. Inspector Khan. I want to talk to talk to you. About what? So this is your final answer? This was my first answer too. What was he asking? What? - What was he asking? He was asking if I want to marry his daughter. So what did you say? What will I say? Does anyone mess with policemen? I said, go and find and auspicious time. I will marry her. - Why don't you do one thing? Eat with his daughter. Riya! Riya! Hello. May I drop you somewhere? No, we will go. Oh no. I was asking her. You are as it is coming with me. If that is your question I have the same answer. I don't want to ask you anything. I want to show you. One minute. I will tell you everything but not now. I will leave now. Move back. Come on, move back. Go back. Who knows? What is this drama? You are a good boy that's why you go for confessions. Right? Why can't you tell the law what you have told God? What have you seen? What have you seen in Sikandar's basement, Anthony? Uncle. Hi, uncle. Uncle Khan. Hello, lshaan. - Uncle, papa? Dear, he will come soon. - You said so even last time. Yes, dear. He is your papa's friend. Ask him. Uncle, are you papa's friend? Yes.. Do you know when he will come? He will come soon, dear. Why are you telling the child stories? Son lshaan, go and play there. At first you used to come alone. Today you have come with someone. Why have you brought him here? Come friend, let me introduce you to Gupta's family. I am asking you. Tell me the truth. Is he alive? Thank you very much. Everything doesn't become good by confession at church, Anthony. You are saying as if l have murdered Gupta. Anthony, people you want to save are not good. And Sikandar has killed countless people. And maybe he has.. - Sir, I want to tell you something. If Sikandar was not there l would have been staying in a gutter. Or die having drugs. Or I would have been a petty thief or gangster. Sir, Sikandar had made me human. Anthony is there today because of Sikandar. Sir, I don't know anything more. And I don't want to know anything more either. Okay. Datta. - Yes, sir. - Guests have come. Arrange for some refreshments. - Okay, sir. Come. - Come. - Close your mouth. What is the matter, sir? Why are you so kind suddenly? Sit. We work in the same area. You have a business and we have a job. We should at least have the formal relations. Sir, neither you nor we have time to waste in formalities. Tell me, why have you called us? In ancient days, kings used to hide their treasure in basements. Time has changed. Now people hide something else and not treasure. What is kept in ancient days, sir? We don't even find the topic while trying to unravel the truth. Murtuza. - Greetings. Inspector Khan. I wished to meet you. You could have come to my home. My bungalow is yours. The servants are yours. And these documents are for you too. You are embarrassing me. Why these bail documents? I have not even arrested them. Not till now. Hello. Jai Hind, sir. No, sir. We didn't find anything here, sir. I think that Michael has given us wrong information. No problem. Just get back. - Okay sir. In future I won't separate you from your people like this. The next time you all will come together. Good bye. It is not our mistake, Seth. That day we were burying the body here.. ..and then Anthony came and.. Anthony? Our hero. - Yes. That dog has barked in front of the police. - Maqsood! Maqsood is right, Seth. You 2 have become mad. What's wrong here? - What are you doing? You are playing who is guilty. Why don't you people do one thing? Why don't you publish an ad that on a certain date.. ..we had killed a policeman by mistake. And we found no place we hid his body in our basement. And in a few days we thought we should shift his body elsewhere. And when we were doing all this, Anthony came there. Yes? And then we thought now since Anthony knows it.. ..we should tell this to the entire world. And you 3 go to the police together. And if you get bored then call me. All of us will sit there and sing songs. Darling, I remember you again. Darling, I swear on God I won't forget you. Seth, one chance. One chance, Seth. Then whoever is the traitor, even if it is Anthony. I will bury him here. All right. You keep your promises. But Seth this is.. I trust Sikandar. I won't spare him. - Spare him. - I will kill him today. Father. He made a mistake. He made a mistake. Why did you do this, Michael? Why? What would I do, Anthony? The police beat me a lot. They did the right thing. You steal money from the church. You listen to confessions. They should kill you instead of beating you. Father. Father. - No! I am dog father. Dog. But father even the dog wants to live. Anthony. Anthony, believe me. Forgive me Anthony. Father. The police have spared me. But my life is at risk now. I won't stay here now, Anthony. Who will allow you to stay? - Father. - Get out. - Father. Father, he has committed a mistake. Michael. What do you mean by you won't stay here? I have arranged everything. I will leave now and reach Goa in the morning. I have a cousin there. Patrick. I will fish in the day. Drink at night and go to sleep. And then I will return after 3 years. Till then, no police, no father, no Sikandar. Father will be there. Michael you won't go anywhere. If I stay here they will.. - Nothing will happen to you. Don't be afraid. I will talk to Bhai about you. No. Anthony I am in danger. I am in great danger. because of Sikandar. What shall I tell them now? That brothers, go. Business is over from today. Why? Because from today my Anthony has become great. Bhai, if you like this life crime so much.. ..then why did you keep me away? Why didn't you give me a gun too and said, go, Anthony. Start killing everyone from now. Why didn't you give me the life you gave to the other 200 people? This life is not for you. - Why not? Why did you take me to father Briganza and.. ..told him to teach this child everything good in this world? Why did you tell him to teach me to.. ..differentiate between good and bad? And today you are telling me to stop differentiating. Then what wrong did I do? You tell me, Anthony. What wrong did I do? The people who betrayed law were right. Should I have spared Gupta? Should I have allowed Shiraz leave for Dubai? You tell me. Speak. What should I do? And do you think that if I stop business.. ..there will be great peace and rest in this city? No. I don't know al that, Bhai. Gupta had 2 small children, Bhai. I saw them. Children should have their father, Bhai. I know. I had lived as an orphan. And it will be more wrong if you kill Michael, Bhai. Michael will die, Anthony. I had promised Seth Murtuza. Even I had promised Michael, Bhai. Seth Murtuza is my master. And Michael is my friend. And Sikandar Bhai's promise holds no importance for you. Understand one thing. You are either with or against the gang. I am with truth, Sikandar Bhai. Are you with me? You don't know Seth Murtuza. Both of us will be killed. And he will bury us in this very basement. Got it! Take this. Keep this money and leave from here. Leave Mumbai. - Why? Leave Mumbai? Bhai, I won't even leave Bandra. Where will go leaving my home? You have become mad. You have to go out of this mess. You want to become a hero, right? You want to become a hero. Then be a hero. Go ahead. You.. Bhai, I don't want to become a hero. What will do by becoming a fake screen hero? You want to become a real hero. A real hero. What will you do by becoming a real hero? What will you do? You will have Maqsood hanged. Send Sikandar to jail. What will you do? What will you do? Bhai, I will do what is right. All right. Go. Go. You will stand in front of Sikandar. But remember one thing. You are alone in future. Absolutely alone. Go. Not me but you are alone Sikandar Bhai. Tears are colorless. Pain knows no discrimination. People smile in depression. There is nothing to cry. Today I am depressed, as my friend is angry with me. Why are we departing? You've become a stranger now. Today I am depressed.. ..as my friend is angry with me. Why are we departing? It is difficult to console my heart. God has to take care of you. God has to take care of me. God has to take care of you. God has to take care of me. Today I have building, bank, balance, property, car. What do you have? What has the heart found and lost here? Who knows how anyone is tied here? My God, give him peace. The one who took my rest before leaving. Give him happiness. Give him victory. Give me defeat. I am crazy God has to take care of you. God has to take care of me. God has to take care of you. Vivek was better than him. He at least knew his lines. He has broken the entire flow. Damn it! Anthony. It is Anthony's mistake. Anthony's. I told him many times to leave this work in the pub. There will be a problem one day. But he used to say, father. What problem? Sikandar Bhai is there. This is the problem. Sikandar Bhai is there. And this very Bhai has left him with you 15 years ago for studies. Today he has gone out finish this very Bhai. You taught brothers to fight. Not with the brother but with badness. Then why have you come here? What good do you expect from this bad man, father? Sikandar it's been 1 5 years since.. ..you have done a good turn to others. This is your 2nd chance. Do something for yourself now. Surrender yourself to the police. Where do you get so much courage? Why? You can become a brother to everyone. Can't I be a father to one? It has burnt you. Show me your hand. Show me. You know to read hands too. It seems you are not destined for good coffee. What is this? You are destined for a wife who prepares good coffee. Riya, I don't know what will happen to me. But one thing is for sure. No one will love me so much. That's why I am not sad. Even if something happens.. Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen to you. And whatever you are doing is absolutely right. Uncle. - Speak. That policeman has come to meet Anthony. Tell me, what we should do. Kidnap him. Where is Sikandar's name here? Sir, I have the same answer to your question. If you think I will spare Sikandar then you are wrong. Sir, you had pushed all you wanted. I have moved as much I had to. Now if you want you can beat me too or arrest me. But I won't speak against Sikandar. I am sorry, father. I can't do this. Brother! - Anthony, run. Run Anthony. - Maqsood sit in the car. Let's go from here. Move. Move. Can't you see? - Move. Run. Run. Run. Run. There. - Maqsood, here. - Let's go. You know well, what you must do, right? Yes, boss! Three bullets into the head! From your own hands. Shucks! The car had to break-down now! Hey! Get down! Riyaz, there's problem with the car. - Come. Hey! Take him there and kill him! Keep watch here! Come on! Bhai, you always asked me.. about the story of my film. Maqsood! Do you remember this place? You'd killed Gupta here. Oh, yes! He showed a nice place to us before he died. - Yes. Riyaz! - Yes! Police! A famous man lived in England 500 years ago, Bhai! I mean Shakespeare. It's his play. Its name is Julius Caesar. There are 4 main characters in the play. First was Julius Caesar. Very powerful! Just like you! His most trusted friend was Brutus. As is our Maqsood. The third one is Cassias. He showed friendship on an outset. But he was jealous inside. You can say just like our Riyaz. And among all these, l, Anthony. He has taken too much of time. Now tell me, does Anthony have any way left to convince you? No! Now no way is left. Sit inside the car! Let's go. Stop the car. - What is the matter? Stop the car! You'll take care in the night? Yes, I'll. Riyaz, I'm not feeling well. Drop me at my house. Riyaz, I'm feeling unwell, drop me at my house! The teacher has killed his student. And he's left the dead body for the animals to eat. Left the body in the jungle! Idiot! That Sikandar who did not leave Gupta's body in.. ..jungle even at night, how can he leave.. ..Anthony's body in the jungle even during the day? - Why? Can Sikandar play such a daring game? Open the dickey! What happened, sir? Has the commissioner lost his dog? He must be without the uniform! May I ask you, where you're going at this time? Why? Is it a crime to go from here at this time? No! But a murder is a big crime. Murder! Yes, Anthony's murder! Sir, can we go now? We're getting late. Go! But tell Sikandar that now he'll not be spared. The law needs the evidence, sir. Gather it soon! If it rains, it'll get washed out. But you.. Who is it? Ali speaking! - Who Ali? From Yakub's gang. So? - I've important information for you. But I want the cash for it. - What is the news? There's a bomb in your Danda factory. What nonsense? This nonsense will cost you 20000 rupees only. If you don't believe me, you can go and see for yourself. But make it soon. It'll explode within 1 5 minutes. Hey! Open the door! Hey! Who is that Yakub's man? Whose dared do it? I'll not spare him. - Maqsood! Hey! Who has seen it? What are you looking at? Go find him! - Cool down! - Cool down?! Cool down? There's bomb in the factory! Hey! - Maqsood! Maqsood! What are you up to? No one came here, neither a car not a man. You're the first man who came in a car since six hours. How can any one.. Hey! Stop your work! Let's go out! Run! Run! Run for your lives! Run! Run! Go! Go to inspector Khan. Tell him that I'll call him. Get in! Can Sikander play such a big game? Sikander! Anthony's murder. This nonsense will cost you 20000 rupees only. If you don't believe me, you can go and see for yourself. It'll explode within 1 5 minutes. Sikandar has fulfilled his promise, sir. Now you.. Don't worry. No one will touch Sikandar. I told you so many times.. Think! Think! Think! What have you achieved with your thinking, man? At least I didn't let the godown to explode. You came in a car! There was a bomb inside! - Yes, there it was. In your car, idiot! Hey! I'm not idiot, but you are. My information was correct. If you talk more, I'll kill you here itself. Look! - Hey! Good! Very good! Tell me Maqsood, how did Yakub's man found out.. ..your new mobile phone number? Only three others had it, right? Riyaz, I and.. Sikandar. Good! Very good! Uncle, today our film will start. Please bless Anthony so that he acts well. Anthony! Your inspector is so great, man! He destroyed the whole gang. Now what's to be done? Tell me! Let's go. Nothing is to be done now. Anthony, we've to go for the shooting. Yes, but I must talk to Sikandar once. Sikander Bhai, Anthony here! Anthony Bhai! Murtuza here. You've grown up, kid! Where is Sikander Bhai? He is here. He is dieing to meet you. But I hope he doesn't die before he meets you. You're coming here to meet Sikander bhai, right? What you call it in your filmy language? Yes! Climax! The climax has begun, kid! Uncle! Please talk to him. How can he go in this manner? What if something happens to him? Riya! I'd told you a lie. It's not my dad's grave. - What? When you met me for the first time, you were crying a lot. So I made him my father. I don't even know who my father is. Sikandar raise me. He is my father. I'm sorry. Whose permission did you have? - Father! Who gave you the permission to take my scooter? You take too many risks. I won't give you my car. Father! What's this? Already I'm very late. I'll ride my car myself. Sit behind, and hold this bible. Father, I'm not going there to ask for money for Church. There's going to be a fight there. I know! And so I'll come with you. I've tried to improve you, but you didn't. Now I'll try to improve them. You'll try to improve the gang men? - Yes. That they should not fight? - Yes! What's the point in all this fighting? Do you think they'll listen to you? Dear, surely they'll. Now don't discuss it with me. Sit at the back. Come on, sit behind! Oh! Oh, why do you leave me here? Wait, Anthony! Boss! Anthony has arrived. Bring him here! Alive! Anthony! You've brought a big team. A priest and a pauper! Where is Bhai? We're not here for a fight. So have you come here for a ballet dance? Priest, you're God's man. We don't want to fight with you. Look, fight is a bad habit. If you've a problem, we can sit and we can talk. There's no problem which cannot be solved with talks. And so I'm.. Hey! Stop your speech or else I'll kill you right now. Father, I had told you, it's of no use. But one must give it a try, Anthony! Have you tried? Now please you go. I'll see what's to be done. All right. I'll go. But what you're doing is wrong. Everything can be talked peacefully.. Hey! I told you to go, come on, get lost! Let him go, or it'll be completely wrong. 'My life is for you. It's not Anthony's fault. My heart is honest about it. I'm with you, boss! My friendship says." If you want, you can cut me into pieces, but let Anthony go. 'I'll sacrifice everything for my friend. Sacrifice! Lord likes sacrifice. Anthony is like my child, boss! Have you forgotten that I'm your father? Ah! Huh! Hey! Deal with him! Ah!! Hey! What happened? Buddy! Please call an ambulance! - Huh! Right foot forward! Right hand forward! And look in front! Hey! You scoundrel! Hey! Don't touch me! Or else I'll kill you. Hey, run! Munna! Michael speaking! Please come here.. ..at the godown very soon. We've a fight with Anthony! Hey! I picked you up from the road. I fed you! And I raised you properly. I raised and made you well known as Sikandar Bhai. Sikander Bhai! This is selfishness! You made me a don for your own benefit. But I made Anthony a human being. So I'll not be unhappy even if I die, boss! Because even if I die I'll be known as Sikandar Bhai. But when you die no one will even come for your funeral. Well done, boys. - Come on! Hey! - Hit them. Why are you hitting me? Hey! Stop! Don't hit me on my face. I want to be a hero. I told you; I want to be a hero. It's the end of your Sikander. No! Hey!! Sikander Bhai! Anthony! Look back! Hey! Bhai! Babu, you've killed uncle? Arrest them. Get in! Anthony! You're getting late for the screening. I'll go! - All right. Don! - I'll go. Hey! Slowly! Slowly! Don't worry, go fast! Go live your dreams. Mr. Khan! - Yes! I've a request to you. Anthony! Anthony! Go live your dreams. Anthony! Anthony! Hey, my hero! Go live your dreams. Sikander Bhai! Thank you! Sir, can I borrow 101 rupees! Yes! Thank you! Bless you! Please come and meet me in jail sometimes.. with your hero. Bye! - shall we go? Bye! Anthony! Anthony! What's it gonna to be. Sikander Bhai.. Yes. It's the first day of the release of your film. How do you feel about it? Anthony! Anthony! Go live your dreams. Go live your dreams. What's it gonna to be. What's it gonna to be.
