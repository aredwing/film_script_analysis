Your dog wouldn't let me cross the bridge. Apparently, he's not a jogger. And you are? I was, for a while. Can you come into Boston tomorrow? I'm pretty busy. I'll check my schedule. See if you can squeeze it in. How about a ride? It's unlocked. You. You. What have I done? Madness. Madness. Why so early? Nobody's on the clock till 8:00. Exactly. Doughnuts? They're, uh... Coply? So, what are you going to do, Jesse? I'm going to mull. Mulling's good. Today's your last day, Suit. New chief starts tomorrow. How do you feel about that? How do I feel about that? I don't know how I feel about that, Lou. He's Jesse. I know that. Oh, what the hell. I'm working on the new me. So, what are you going to do? After I mull, I'm going to do some jogging. You know what I mean, Jesse. I thought he should hear this. He's a dog. If you say so. I'm going to have to run a tab for a while. That okay? For a while. Most golden retrievers live for affection. He never seems to want any. Think he has issues. What issues? - My issues. - Fear of loss? When I met him, he was sitting next to his owner's body. Existential despair. This was a stupid idea. How you dealing with it? Well, we're kind of like roommates. The loss. What loss? The job. I'm jogging. Jogging clears your mind? I hate jogging. Why bother? It clears my mind. Have you talked to your ex-wife? No. - Have you wanted to talk to Jenn? - Yes. But you have not talked to her? That's correct. Last time, you said you can't call her. No. I said she can't call me. Why can't she call you? I ripped the phone out of the wall. You had a fight? No. I picked a fight, three weeks ago. You were angry. No-- frightened. Why is this so hard? I'm in a dead zone. It's not the first time you've felt this way. No, I can't get cell phone reception in my house. I got to go outside to the point. Keep a bottle of scotch out there? That's not funny. I didn't mean it to be. I'm not that far gone. If you say so. You lost your job in L.A. Now you've lost your job in Paradise. Are you drinking? I always drink. Are you drinking a lot? I'm sticking to my rule. Two drinks a night. That's correct. - Are two drinks a night a lot? - No. - Then, you're not drinking a lot. - I'm having two drinks at night. You're having two drinks at night alone. Did you tell me this morning you're jogging? I did. You hate jogging. I was wondering if you could feed Reggie for me tonight. I can. Ooh, I got to go. Rose. Like you to meet your new chief, William Butler. Actually, we've met already. The job interview. Based on ex-Chief Stone's attitude, I bet you never thought I'd be standing here. Well... It's funny how things work out, isn't it? Yes, it is. Councilman Hansen, I heard your daughter was in the hospital. How is she doing? Oh, she's fine. It's... Just an appendectomy. William, I wish you wouldn't do that. Do what? Finish my sentences. I'm sorry, sir. She'll be fine. Is the temp chief in? He is. Could I see him? We don't stand on ceremony here. Go right on in. Well, I don't want to meddle in police business. See you at dinner, William. Information's out there. All you have to do is let it in, Rose. William. Oh, sorry. I wasn't expecting you... Until tomorrow. I-I thought it would be better-- well, maybe a little less embarrassing for you, if you could move back to your old desk today. Yeah. I guess it might be... Awkward. How's your wife doing? Small town. It's just an... Appendectomy. She'll be fine. The badge. Excuse me? The chief's badge. May I have it? It's Lou Carson's badge. Jesse wouldn't carry it. Well, I'm sure you're very busy. Good work solving that convenient store robbery, Detective Simpson. We don't have detectives. Detective Gammon. We don't have detectives. Good afternoon, Paradise Police Department. Luthor, I'm on the beach road going out to Jesse's. Can you get out here right away? I can. And bring Doc Perkins. You don't have to take him over to your house. Just feed him here. What's wrong? Cindy Van Aldan is dead. Who found her? I did. I found her on the beach road about a mile from here. Was she coming to see you, Jesse? I got that from her two days ago. You didn't open it. I got preoccupied. Read it if you want. Read it out loud. "Jesse, I'm sorry I haven't stayed in touch. "You are my best friend. "I need to talk. "I tried to call you, but your phone is disconnected. "I'm coming back to Paradise. Cindy." Doc Perkins said it looks like a drug overdose. Did he say anything else? He said she just stopped breathing. When's toxicology come back? Jesse, you're not the police chief anymore. Have dinner with me. You want me to have dinner with you tonight? I do. Who'll watch your boys? It's Jim's night with the boys. You don't want me to be alone. That's correct. What are you looking at? Hello? Jesse? - Where's Reggie? - Home. I had to cancel an appointment. Thank you. So, I've cancelled my appointment. What's so urgent? You said I had a fear of loss. No, you said that. No, last time you said I had a fear of loss. Because the time before you told me you did. Why is this so hard? I hate cell phones. I don't want anyone else to have that number. I called Jenn. You told me you haven't spoken to her. - I hung up. - So you haven't spoken to Jenn in three weeks? That's correct. Tell me about addiction. - What about it? - Drugs. Mm-mmm. This is not about you. How do you know? 'Cause I know a lot about addiction. You're not a candidate for pills. Booze is your drug of choice. Did you come here for help, or did you come here for information? I came here for help... and information. I busted this kid a couple of years ago. - For using drugs? - Drunk and disorderly. Her mom's very well-off. One of those big houses out in Paradise Point. Divorced. An ugly one. Mom wanted to take her home. I insisted she spend the night in the Paradise jail. That sounds like you. Talked to her most of the night-- good kid; missed her dad. I said that I was her friend and that I'd keep in touch. That sounds like you. Mom put her in rehab. One of those expensive places in Boston. When she got out, she went back to college. And you kept in touch. I did. For a while. What happened? She's dead. Drugs? Most likely. Did they give her prescription drugs when she left rehab? I have no idea. When I asked you what happened, I meant, why did you lose contact with her? I guess I got preoccupied with my favorite subject. What subject's that? Me. Did I ever tell you you have a hyperactive sense of responsibility? You did. Well, let's recap. You live where no one can find you. You drink alone. You've talked to your ex-wife every day since your divorce. You've cut yourself off from her for three weeks. And now you feel responsible for this kid's death. That's about it. Before you came here yesterday, I hadn't seen you in a month. Three weeks. We need to spend more time together. Once a month is not enough. If you say so. I got wasted last night. Okay. And that's why you called me. That's correct. If you need me, I'll be at the speed trap, sir. I think it would be more appropriate not to refer to the entrance to Paradise as the speed trap. I understand, sir. You don't have to call me sir. Did you get the medical examiner's report, Luthor? Sir, that won't come in until toxicology is finalized. Doc Perkins' preliminary finding showed no sign of foul play. Drug overdose is most likely the... Cause of death. Good. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. It's a horrible tragedy, but at least there's no indication of a crime. Suicide's a crime. Only technically. What I meant was, lots of kids OD. But crime is bad for tourism, and tourism is Paradise's main business. I know that, sir. We may have gotten lucky here. It didn't make this morning's paper, and I think we can get the Town Council to exert some influence over at the Gazette. Headline it something like, "Boston College Student Found Dead of Drug Overdose on Beach Road." But she lives here. No, her Mom lives here; she lived at school in Boston. What do you think, Luthor? My sense is, we need to tell the truth, sir. That is the truth. Thanks for dinner. Are you okay? I'm fine. Is he there? He is. How do you feel about that? How do I feel about that? Got to go. Thelma. Jesse. Can I help you, Jesse? Your hair smells of violets. Do you know what violets smell like? No, but I'm sure violets would smell that way if I'd ever smelled a violet. I don't mean this in any negative way, but you are maybe the simplest person I've ever met. In what way? You know what you want. Sometimes I know what I want. You know what you want right now. I do. Are you going to tell me? I can't tell you. You know what you want, but you can't tell me. I don't want to presume. I see. I can tell you what I'm hoping. Tell me what you're hoping. I'm hoping I can see you sometime. You mean you're hoping that you can see me again. Sorry to keep you waiting, Jesse. I came early. Mrs. Gleffey's a hottie. Hadn't noticed. So you're done with your ex-wife? Oh, didn't say that. I'm obsessed with Thelma, but I'm in love with Cissy. Have you talked to her since she moved to Boston? How would you know she moved to Boston? Small town. You and Cissy...? Me and Cissy what, Hasty? She won't return my calls. Nice. Well, I just closed on a slightly used Beamer M6. Minty. Can you imagine? Who's the lucky guy, Hasty? Don't ask. Could you turn that thing off? I can. So, how's the drinking thing going? I'm very fond of you, Jesse. I know that, Hasty. Can I tell you something? Do I have a choice? I'm running for Town Council. Hasty, you're a felon. So's Marion Barry. I got one word for you, Jesse-- redemption. Are you going to church? No. That's my platform-- redemption. I'm sorry. This shouldn't just be about me. Don't you think I've got a winner? Redemption. Just one word. It's easy to get emotionally. Kind of punches you in the gut. I don't like the train. Lets me think too much. Excuse me? You know that car you let me drive? - Test-drive. - Can I drive it to Boston? You already test-drove it. Perhaps you could consider it a loaner. That would imply you got a car in here for repair. You have my Scout. You're repairing it. Your Scout's beyond repair. It's a rusted hulk. Exactly. But I don't know what that's supposed to mean. - You're saying I have issues? - You do. How would you know that? I'm the police chief. - I know everything. - So I have to spend the night in jail? We both do. What is that supposed to mean? If you spend the night in jail, I can't go home. You can't put me in jail just because you think that I have issues. No, I can't. And my mom wanted me out of here. She did. So then, why can't I go home? Public drunkenness is illegal. - This is not right! - I'm not in the right and wrong business; I'm in the legal and illegal business. You don't make any sense. Detective Gammon, can I talk to you for a moment? We don't have detectives, sir. Well, what should I call you? Rose. Well, Rose, as you know, we're understaffed here. We lost a very good man when Detective DeAngelo left. I'm sorry. How do we refer to our personnel? As "Officers," sir. Chief Stone had a problem in that... He didn't like Officer D'Angelo. That isn't what I was going to say, sir. You don't have to call me sir, Rose. What should I call you? I don't know. How about "Chief"? Well, Chief, the former chief felt that Officer D'Angelo spent too much time writing tickets. - That's a good thing. - Tickets bring in... Lot of revenue. Anyway, being shorthanded, I'm going to need you here manning your desk. This has nothing to do with you being a woman. I want you to know that, Rose. You need someone to man the telephones, to be a kind of dispatcher. I prefer that you think of it more as a temporary kind of home guard action. Then I'll try to think of it that way. Thank you, Rose. Thank you. I guess it takes me 24 hours to get offended. You could have called. I'm in a dead zone. Okay. Truth is, I forgot. By the time I thought to call you, it was raining again. Was it important? I don't know. I got a perp on trial for robbery and murder. What's your problem? What makes you think I got a problem? Every time you stop by to see how I'm doing, either you got a problem, or I got a problem. Well... you've got a problem. So do you. How do you know? Coply intuition. Oh. I don't think the perp's the perp. Excuse me? I don't think he did it. Did what? Robbed a liquor store, got the money, shot the owner in the face three times. Nice. Your bust? No. One of my ambitious college students. Case is a slam dunk. Eyewitness ID. Credit card receipts, cell phone records put him in the area at the right time. Final arguments are today. And you got a problem? I do. Why do you have a problem? Coply intuition. If I set it up, will you talk to him? I will. Just one thing. This time, I want to be deputized. You want to be a consultant who's deputized? It might be nice to carry a badge again. What's your name again? Jesse. And yours? You sure this is police business? Yes, ma'am. State Homicide. Because Rutherford College doesn't reveal this kind of information. Not even to family. What if the parents were paying the bills? The privacy and integrity of Rutherford students is paramount. But since you're with the government, what would you like to know? - May I see that? - I don't think so. What would you like to know? How was Cindy doing? Cynthia was unfortunately showing a downward trend in achievement over the last year. And, of course, she dropped out of school in the middle of last quarter. Could you be mistaken? I don't think so. Was anyone informed? There's no need. Her tuition was paid for in advance, and it's not refundable. Why do you want to know? She's dead. Do you have any other questions? I don't think so. Chief Stone. Jesse would be better. I heard, small town. Did I miss your call? I didn't call. This would be about Cynthia. Come in. For a mother, the loss of a child is so unfair. I'm sorry I didn't call. I got preoccupied. Chief Butler mentioned the possibility of suicide. Cindy didn't commit suicide. How do you know? I just know. You're not Chief of Police anymore, Jesse. Old habit. You were friends. We were friends. There's just some things I should know about Cindy that I don't. What happened with college? Nothing happened with college. After rehab, she went back to school. What about last quarter? She seemed fine. She was very involved in school; she'd even met someone. Did you meet him? No. Do you remember his name? Of course I remember his name. Cynthia met him in rehab; his name was Val. Do you know his last name? No. I know you don't think much of me as a parent. I didn't say that. Have you talked to Cindy's father? I haven't talked to him since the custody hearing. - Has Cindy? - I should hope not. Does he know? I assume so. He's living in Singapore. Had you talked to Cindy recently? Had you? You're the guys that put him away. So, why should we talk to someone from State Homicide? You don't have to. Well, we always want to explore all our options. But my client's not going to be convicted. We presented a very strong defense. Not that strong if you're talking to me. I've been looking over their cross-exam. I have some questions. "We have you at the crime scene." Charles Morris: "I wasn't there. " "If you can prove you were somewhere else, speak up." Public Defender: "Objection." Objection. If the prosecutor's stupid enough to help establish an alibi, why wouldn't you let him? Are you trying to tell me how to do my job? No. I am asking you a question. Your client's gonna get convicted, and he's gonna get sentenced to the maximum. If you can cast reasonable doubt as to his whereabouts, why wouldn't you let him speak? Can you talk? I'm sorry... Please address your questions... Officer Stone. Jesse. Jesse, I can't prove that I was somewhere else. Can you prove where you were last night? - Not all night. - Jesse, I have seen the pictures. His face. I couldn't shoot someone. I don't own a gun. I don't even know how to use one. You were identified by an eyewitness. Yes, sir. Do you think the witness had a prejudice? I don't think so. No. If you want to know where I was... Are you a lawyer, Officer Stone? No, I'm a cop. Don't try to tell me how to do my job. This interview is over. We did not recover the murder weapon. So, no prints. Something doesn't make sense. What doesn't make sense? I don't know. I gotta think about it. Tranquility is committed to providing a high standard of care to our patients in a nurturing environment. Do you normally discharge a client in two weeks, Dr. Parkinson? We don't have clients. We treat patients, Officer, uh... Jesse. Well, Officer Jesse, the duration of a patient's stay varies. How so? If a patient's addiction is a form of self-medication because of a bigger psychological issue, in some cases, two weeks is sufficient with, of course, intensive out-patient follow-up. Did Cindy get intensive out-patient follow-up? Was Cynthia Van Aldan self-medicating? How do you know Cynthia's duration of treatment was two weeks? She was a friend. Was Cindy self-medicating? That's between the patient and her doctor. And her doctor would be? Her doctor would be me. Why is State Homicide interested in a death that the local police have described as a probable suicide? Suicide's not good for your image. Addiction is a complex problem. Do you feel any sense of responsibility as her doctor? Cynthia's death is of course a horrible tragedy. You haven't answered my question. That's correct. When she was discharged, was she prescribed drugs? I can't tell you that. We're not allowed to disclose patient information. There are privacy laws, Officer Jesse. Except for family. Even for family, she was 19. Even if they're paying the bill. That's not to be considered. Are prescription drugs used in the treatment of alcohol dependency, Doctor? They can be. There are tranquilizers and antidepressants that may serve as an interim step in the treatment of alcohol dependency. With, of course, intensive out-patient follow-up. Of course. So, you'd consider it. If one of our doctors felt it was appropriate, it's possible he or she might prescribe medication. Well, you were her doctor. That's all I'm required to tell you. Were you thinking of checking yourself in, Chief Stone? I commute to Boston. I live in Paradise. Small town. She was at the sanctuary a couple of times recently. She wasn't one of my regular girls but she did spend some overnights. You have a good memory. I do. She was pretty wasted. Was she drunk? No, drugs. Maybe painkillers. For sure she was shooting smack. I saw the tracks. What do you know about a place called Tranquility? They give families the answers they want to hear. They cost a lot, don't do much good, and can be part of the problem. This kid went in for alcohol and came out with prescription drugs. Well, heroin's the main course, but they might've provided the appetizers. Places like Tranquility just substitute addictions. No follow-up, no exit strategy, it's a rehab mill. I'm starting to rant, that's not part of my job description. She's dead, isn't she? Yes. What was her name? Cindy Van Aldan. Thank you. Can I ask you something? You can. Is Cindy the reason we're having dinner, Jesse? Yes. Was there any other reason? Yes. So you think we might've had dinner otherwise? Yes. Last time you said you didn't know what to do with dinner with a nun. How did I do, Sister? You did just fine. Figure if I practice, I'll get it right. I just... ...like you. I like you, Jesse. Most men and women lead lives of quiet desperation. That's a quote from someplace. My desperations are never quiet. I got hats older than you. We found a common interest. Used cars? Sex. Anyone special? That I'm having sex with? I'm not seeing anyone at the moment. I'm divorced. I knew that. Why are you still carrying a gun? Peace of mind. Do you always carry one? Yes. I was a cop in L.A. Always a cop? No. I played baseball before I got hurt. - Were you any good? - I was very good. - What do you know. - Interested. You over your wife? Ex-wife. You over her? No. You looking for a husband? No. I've got two kids in college. You married young. I did. Two kids in college, that's a lot of money. Their father can afford it. I raised them, he paid for it. He's always been good that way. In what way wasn't he good? Where his penis led, he followed. I enjoyed our dance. Pressure of possibility. The way your hips moved under your dress. What possibility? Possibility of seeing you without the intervening dress. I'm not a good basket to put all your eggs in. I'm not going to fall in love with you. I don't think you'll fall in love with me. We can be each other's friend. We can have some nice, uncomplicated sex. I'm going to take a shower. I wish you could join me. The water is wide.  I can't cross o'er.  And neither have I wings to fly.  Give me a boat  To carry two  And we shall row  My love and I.  I don't know why people do that. It doesn't do any good. So, why do you want my picture? I like you. Turn that thing off! What is that about? It's rude, and I don't like 'em. They don't work anyway. Garbage disposals are supposed to dispose of your garbage, so why do you have to sort your garbage before you only dispose of some of it? Same thing. - Okay. - Just 'cause you earned back the right to use it doesn't mean you have to. You're not usual. People your age are always certain of what's usual. How would you know that? I used to be your age. When's the last time you talked to your dad? Not since he went away. Fathers are important. Now that you got your cell phone back, why don't you call him? - Don't tell me what to do. - I didn't. Why doesn't he call me? I asked you first. Why won't you talk to your dad? Don't get all parental on me, Jesse, okay? I'm afraid he won't want to talk to me. Okay. Maybe your dad's afraid of the same thing. I got to go to group. Here. The divorce wasn't your fault. I know something about divorce. You can only do what you can do, Jesse. When's your gun permit expire? I noticed you're carrying. That's good police work, Chief. Retired police officers are entitled to carry. - It's federal law. - You were let go. Sir, if you would care to read the transcripts of the Town Council meeting, I think that you would find that former Chief Stone was granted early retirement. How generous. So you're armed at a funeral? You can assume I'm... Always armed. Don't finish my sentences. Sir, I feel the department should formally express its regrets to Mrs. Van Aldan. Cindy did not commit suicide. It doesn't really matter if it was an accidental overdose or suicide. There's clearly no sign of foul play. Looking under rocks is only gonna cause that poor mother further grief. It's just a... Horrible tragedy. Stay out of this, Stone. Luthor, shall we? You can only do what you can do. Was Cindy ever busted? Jesse... Did you do a criminal background check? He said it wasn't necessary. But you did one anyway. He said for you to stay out of it. What do you think he meant by that? That you stay out of it. I'm going to find out one way or the other. Jesse, Cindy was pretty close to bottom. She was busted two months ago on possession of heroin and OxyContin. And prostitution. Jury was only out about three hours. His attorney looked stunned. Guy's got his head up his ass. Sorry, Rose. So the guy has his head up his ass... and...? Brand-new public defender with an oversized ego. He should have just pled him guilty. I'm not sure he did it. If you want an argument, you're gonna have to change the subject. How do you know he didn't do it? I don't. Where do they got him now? They'll keep him in County awaiting sentencing. You said there was an eyewitness. Doesn't mean it was him. A lot of white people are afraid of black people, won't look 'em in the eye. What did you get out of him before the PD shut him up? He said he was somewhere else but couldn't prove it. If you don't like the answers you're getting, check your premises. My new boss just walked in. You want to put my coat over your head? How about I put mine over yours? Doesn't look too social. Who's the guy doing the finger pointing? Wealthy local. Runs a high-end rehab place in Boston. How do you know that, Jesse? Small town. - How's everybody doing? - Fine. Rose? Maybe later. I'll have one, Laura. That's two. Looks like my boys are still up. My mom won't say no to them. How's your new chief? I don't like him. You sound like me. I'm gonna get my job back, Rose. Fate won't do this to me. Jesse, have you ever considered counseling? You mean, like, a shrink? Have you ever considered it? Only crazy people see shrinks. I'm seeing one. You're seeing a shrink? I am. Is he any good? I have nothing to compare him to. What's he like? He's an ex-cop, so he's unorthodox, which is good for me. Knows a lot about addiction... and divorce, which would be good for you. Would he see me? I'll talk to him. What are you gonna do, Jesse? I'm gonna go home and feed Reggie. Don't be cute. It's hard for me not to be cute. Good night, Jesse. Hello. And you would be? Jesse. Do you have a last name? Stone. And you would be? Amanda. Do you have a last name? No. Do you have an appointment with Mr. Fish? I do not. Mr. Fish is in. You're not going to give me a hard time, Amanda? You're on the list. What list is that? Mr. Fish is in. He's having breakfast. Thank you, Steven. I guess I'm on the list. Amanda does have the names of the people I don't mind seeing. I'm touched. Beautiful woman. Well, there are certain advantages to having an attractive woman as an assistant. Such as? Let's just leave it at that, Jesse Stone. Do you miss Alan? I don't miss having a psychopath in my outer office, no. Actually, he was a sociopath. Well, he's a dead sociopath. Some say he was hit by that car intentionally. Can I tell you something, Jesse Stone? You can. You're off your game. Your banter isn't up to standard. You seem preoccupied. Do I? You're not wearing your PPD hat. It's retired. As are you. You thinking about coming over to the dark side, Jesse Stone? Not hardly. I lost a friend. Would you like some eggs? She was being treated for an alcohol issue at a place called Tranquility. Rehab mill. I've heard it described as that. They graduated her on prescription drugs, and within a year, she was into smack and prostitution. How's that happen, Gino? You're asking me? I am. You have scruples about prostitution. So do you. And you know something about drugs. Hey, I am just a boxing promoter. You're a significant contributor to Sister Mary John's shelter. Now, that is private. You hear things. I hear a lot of things. And you know a lot about drugs. If we are to remain friends, you'll have to allow me my personal vanities and my double standards. It was nice seeing you, Jesse Stone. Did you change your mind about picking up the check? Hey, I'm a pensioned retiree. If you say so. I don't think he did it. Jury didn't agree. Why don't you think he did it? I don't know. Seemed like a decent kid. So did Ted Bundy. If you don't like the answers you're getting, check your premises. I think it's right in our face and we can't see it. You proficient on that thing? Not hardly. Well, unless you want to call in one of your college boys, check for unsolved crimes on the same date in the same vicinity, about the same time as the killing. I'm sure one of my highly educated college graduates would have run this. Are you now? Okay. We got a rape three blocks away. What time was the killing? The rapist approached the victim at 11:43. Well, unless the guy is a two-minute wonder, we got a theory. We got more than that. We got the rapist's DNA. You got the perp's DNA? Hold on a second. Give me a minute. I-I got to have my fingers catch up with my mind here. I'm checking my premises. Couldn't match his DNA with anything at the robbery scene, but we did get it. My sense is, it'll match the rapist. Oh, I believe it will. So, why didn't you call me with this? Why'd you come in? I just like you. Give me the badge. I got a call from a Dr. Parkinson at a place called Tranquility. And a call from Rutherford College. They were inquiring into State Homicide's investigation into the death of a Cynthia Van Aldan. Good for them. After Dr. Parkinson suggested that you were impersonating a police officer, I assured him that you were working for State Homicide. Did you also get a call from the Paradise Police Chief? I'm not going to tell you that. Give me the badge. When are you going to get your head out of your ass and think? Do you want to know who she was? I do not. Are you sure this is police business? It is. May I see your badge? What's your name? Lewis Lipinsky. What do you do here, Lewis? I work for Dr. Parkinson. - You're an intern. - Yes. Where do you go to school? Rutherford College. I'm sure Dr. Parkinson shared with you the fact that I saw him two days ago on police business. - He did. - Are you trying to hide something, Lewis? No, sir. - Jesse. - Jesse. Lewis, I'm simply trying to locate a former patient. His name is Val. We've never had a patient named Val. How would you know that, Lewis? Well, it's not a common name, sir. Not a common name, Jesse. Jesse. Could Val have been an employee? Oh, no. "Oh, no," what, Lewis? We're not supposed to talk about Valery. You're not supposed to talk about Valery who, Lewis? Valery Siminov. - Because? - Because he was let go. Because? I believe he falsified his rsum. Yeah, I-I-I think that was the reason. Was there another reason, Lewis? It might have had something to do with the fact that he was busted for drugs. And prostitution? Yes. Pimping. Please do not tell Dr. Parkinson about this. What did Valery do here, Lewis? He was only an orderly, so that could hardly reflect on Tranquility's mission of providing care and nurturing to our guests who have entrusted us with their destiny. When was he fired? Almost two months ago. Do you know he was busted with Cindy Van Aldan? She was a former patient. I... I do know that. I also know her from Rutherford. Do you know she's dead? Doesn't look good on Tranquility's rsum. No, it doesn't. You're a good kid, Lewis. This what you want to do with your life? No, Jesse. Good. Afternoon, Thelma. Afternoon, Jesse. May I have the keys? Nice car. I need to sell it. Well, I might consider a purchase. I'm just not quite convinced yet. Maybe if I test-drove it for a couple of days. What are you writing? My stump speech. Your trips to Boston have created concern in some circles. Hey, I'm working for State Homicide. There are people in Paradise-- powerful people-- that would like the Van Aldan death... forgotten. Dr. Parkinson call you? I wouldn't associate with that piece of crap. All I'm saying is, you could lose your pension. You could go to jail. It's been five days, and knowing you, I'm sure you've broken some laws by now. I'd rather regret the things I've done than the things I haven't done. Two days. I'm very fond of you, Jesse. Morning. I find a certain poetic symmetry to having you meet me. You gave me the heads-up about Alan. So, speaking symmetrically, you have something to give me. I do. Two tickets to the fight Saturday night at the Garden. Okay. Oh, and there was one additional item. Moscow Nights. - Ring a bell? - No. Outcall massage. The missing part of your puzzle is Valery Siminov. Wetback pimp. You don't like this guy. What's not to dislike? These Russians-- they have no code. "I will bow to no man"-- that's not a code. Russian mob? No, a freelance wannabe. He recruits his girls by working at rehab clinics. He's a predator. He knows their profile, see? He romances them when they're at their most vulnerable. What happened to your friend? She's dead. Overdosed on heroin. Tranquility put her on antidepressants, pronounced her cured and forgot about her. So did I. Not your fault. When she stopped calling, I could have found her. I think I know you, Jesse Stone. Meaning? Meaning... you will have to do something about your friend. These Russians are bad guys. You need to be careful. The ugly truth of it, Gino, is, it doesn't matter a whole hell of a lot to me. It was nice talking to you, Jesse Stone. Thanks, Laura. That's one. WOMAN Welcome to Moscow Nights, offering the complete massage experience in the privacy of your hotel room. Would you like to speak to one of our beautiful Russian therapists? CINDY Jesse... Jesse... I'm sorry. You're my best friend. I need to talk. I tried to call you, but your phone is disconnected. I'm coming back to Paradise. What are you looking at? You called me? We'll talk about this later. The DNA's a match. Your perp's not the perp. But he is a rapist. So the judge declares a mistrial, and you arrest him for the rape. That's correct. I'd like to be a fly on the wall for that one. You could've told me this on the phone. You close to, uh, Cynthia Van Aldan? I was. Got any evidence of foul play? I do not. If you get anything, I'll go after it. Don't do this on your own. Jesse... thanks for this. You are Mr. Stone. Jesse. Come in. Please. You speak Russian? I was talking to her. What's your name? Svetlana. Is she Russian or not? I'm paying for a Russian. No, she is not Russian, but she is young and beautiful, is she not? Are you a cop? Why would you ask? If I ask, you have to tell me. Otherwise, it's entrapment. No, I'm not a cop. Good. You, of course, have to pay in advance. Then I will leave. You're not gonna stay and watch. After you pay, I will leave. Actually, I was a cop. A small town police chief, but I got into a little trouble, and I had to retire early. Come on. What's your real name? Emily. You have family, Emily? Yes. If you need to talk to someone, call me. Go home. Please go home, Emily. You a tough guy? I'm tough enough. Cindy Van Aldan. Horrible tragedy. I didn't kill her. You might as well have. "I bow to no man." What's that about? If your friends could see you now. You prey on kids. You're thinking about shooting me. I am. You can't kill me. Why can't I kill you? The hotel has your name. Actually, I registered under an assumed name. Valery Siminov. I paid cash. You need to retire, Valery. That's not in my plan. Okay. So shoot me. I've been thinking about that. Oh, this? Just kidding. Do you hunt, Valery? No, I think it's cruel. Oh. Well, here's what I was thinking. When you shoot a big animal like a deer or an elk with a high powered rifle, you can shoot him right through the heart, and he still might run off, sometimes for quite a distance. The animal's already dead, he just doesn't know it yet. It's a good thing animals can't think. Now, people... People can think. I'm going to haunt you, Valery. You won't know when it's gonna happen, but when it does, you'll have time to think. You need to consider retirement, Valery. I'm enjoying the hell out of it. Oh, and when you work your way out of all that, one piece of advice for your own good: Stay away from the mini-bar. The judge declared a mistrial. How'd you do it? Well, I just stayed at it. You saved my life. They said they'd make a formal announcement later on today. Then I can get out of here. I don't know why not. Charles Morris? Am I free to go? You're under arrest for rape and assault perpetrated on Mrs. Jane Francis on February 4. You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions. - Do you understand? - He does. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. Do you understand? - He does. - You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police... Cracker Jack? I got good and plenty. If you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present, Thanks for this. you have the right to stop questioning at any time until you talk to a lawyer. Do you understand what I... Yes, he understands. I feel he has issues, Jesse. We both do. You took off early. I did. Where's your Cruiser? At the station. What'd you need to talk about? Did Cindy commit suicide? I don't think so. But we don't know. No, we don't. He won't let me go after it, Jesse. I would expect no less of him. I want an answer. I know you want an answer. I may not find one. I see it as my job not to look the other way. You quit, didn't you? Numbness of the heart. You do this for me? For myself. You sure about that? I don't belong there anymore. I feel it in my cells. Does Rose know? She understands. She said she can't afford not to stay. You're a good cop, Suit. You can hang your hat on that. You going after Tranquility? No. They didn't help her, but they didn't kill her. My sense is, you're going after somebody, Jesse. I want to help. I'm not after anybody, Suitcase. There are no place out there for graft, or greed or lies, or compromise with human liberties. And if that's what the grown-ups have done with this world that was given to them, then we'd better get those boys' camps started fast and see what the kids can do. And it's not too late, because this country is bigger than the Taylors, or you, or me, or anything else. Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here. You just have to see them again! Go on! Move it! To the left! Stop, Jeff! Stop! I guess this is just another lost cause, Mr. Paine. All you people don't know about lost causes. Mr. Paine does. He said once they were the only causes worth fighting for. This is Jesse. Leave a message. He knows who you are. Well, that was stupid, Gino. Don't turn around, Valery. I don't think you're gonna make it. Good morning. Paradise Police Department. I'd like to report a shooting.
