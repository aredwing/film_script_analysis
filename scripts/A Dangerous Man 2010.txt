I'II see you soon. - I love you, babe. - I love you too. Out of the fuckin' car, bitch! Now! Shane? Shane! You OK? - Come back, I'm gonna kill you, bitch! - No! Shane? Don't leave me! You hunted him down, just like you used to hunt down the enemy on the battlefield. You're a trained killer who went after the stupid son of a bitch who went after your wife! Admit it! Shane! I don't know what you're talking about. You got the wrong man. That's bullshit. We checked your past. You were Special Forces. Someone took this guy apart! Look at you. Now you're just a murderer. What the hell happened to you? The guy carjacked my wife. I chased him off. It doesn't mean I killed him. You're going away for a long time, tough guy. - Yeah, where he's at. - Come on, bitch! Yo, what's up, man? I'm sorry, so very sorry. I know I promised to wait for you, but I can't wait any longer. It's been six years, I need to move on. I need to get my life back. I love you so much, Shane. Get out of here, Daniels! Big day's tomorrow. Counsel, I take it that you're ready? We are, Your Honor. I believe you have our recommendation in front of you? As you've read, the prosecution has filed for a dismissal of charges against my client, and, because of that, we will expect certain details to be included in the record when his record is expunged. And what are those? That a weapon, one that matches the ballistics profile of the one used in the initial murder, was recovered in the possession of another subject. That the DNA of said subject matches the DNA that was recovered in the initial murder investigation. AII of this was brought to light with the help of Project Innocence. And that DNA was never admitted into the original trial? OK. I find sufficient evidence to support a dismissal of any and all charges against the defendant. Also, the state will award Mr. Daniels $300,000, $50,000 for each year Mr. Daniels was erroneously incarcerated. I trust you are satisfied with that, Mr. Daniels? Your Honor, I gave 14 years of my life to the military, six years hard time in a federal penitentiary. I don't know why you people think that money can replace a life. There are no words to describe what it's like when you're an innocent man in prison, sitting there and waiting and hoping and praying that this day will come. I don't believe that money can buy back my name, my reputation, my wife, my family, and all that I lost. Mr. Daniels, the court recognizes your grief and we sympathize with your loss... I don't want your money. I want my life back. Take him to the safe house. A nice lady like you needs a nice car like this. Come on, I'II take you for a ride. Come on, get in. This car's worth more than you can trade. Look here, it's a great deal. Tonight, right now. Get in. You should shut your mouth for one fuckin' second and listen. That's why you're slippin', dawg. Yo. Want to buy some wheels? Naw, man, you know... I don't know, how much? How much? For this classic car? Tell you what: I like your face, so, uh... - How about everything you got? - Everything I've got? Look, man, you want to jack me? Is that it? - Yeah, that's it. - Let me tell you something. I just got out of prison for something I didn't do, and, before that, I used to, like, you know, study real hard and learned all kinds of different ways to kill motherfuckers just like you. This motherfucker talking shit. So let me go. Just let me go on by, or I'II fuck you up ugly. - "Fuck you up ugly," he says. - Both of us? Tell me something. What's that mean, "Fuck you up ugly?" It means your mama won't recognize you in your coffin. Talking about my mama? Hand it over, motherfucker. See this gun here? I'm just gonna pop the slide release, then pull this bitch off... ...and then I'm gonna take this and I'm gonna fuck you up ugly. No! No, no! Fuck you. Put that shit away, boy, before somebody gets hurt. Now count to 100, and get some help for those two fools. - I'm taking this car, bitch. - Bring it, motherfucker. Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two... What is this shit? Oh, come on. OK, just pick a station, man. My ears are throwing up. Just relax, man. I'm just trying to find a good station. Listen to DJ, man. Look, I gotta take a leak, Sergey. Pull over, man. - Are you serious? - I'm serious. Oh, man... You've always gotta take a squirt, man. - Dude, slow down, man. That was a cop. - Yeah. Yeah, I saw him. Man, you better throw that out. We got an open container issue here. Open con... We got a stolen car issue here, man. I hope they did a good job on the VIN. That's true. He's probably hammering a donut, anyway. He didn't even look up when we passed. Let me toss the rest of the empties out when we get to the rest stop, all right? - Yeah. - I gotta take a squirt. Come on. Just pull over, man! There's a rest stop ahead. Take a right. Take a right here. I love you so much, Shane. I'm sure! Well, we won't talk, we won't talk. No problem. Got that for you. - You should go pee. - That's what I'm gonna do. - Go put those in a can. - Yeah, I'II do that. Damn. You're luck... lucky I don't throw the glass one at you! We have a 629, two males down, liquor store on Hastings. Unit 5, please respond. Potential suspects in black 300. Will approach. Driver's license and registration? No English. Sorry. You? You speak English? OK, get out. Put your hands on the car. Drop your keys and put your hands on the car. Step off to the side. Take a step to the side. Whose car? What's in the trunk? You don't understand, huh? You can't tell me whose car it is or what's in the trunk? What's this? Shirt. Shirt? What, clothes? Wanna hurry, before that cop decides to mess with us, too? Coming. Fuck. Please... just go. Take the car and go. Can't do that, man. You'd call back up. Here, take my radio. Take my radio! - Holy shit! - Please! Please... Shit! - Run, man! - Markov! - Please... - Who's in charge now? Come on! Come on, buddy! Come on! Shoot this motherfucker! What the hell? Whoa, whoa. Hey. Take it easy. I'm the good guy. You're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Man. Shitload of cash in here. Did you know that? What do you want to do now? - Is that car of yours drivable? - Yeah, more or less. Go start it up. Holy fuck! There's a body in here, man. Get the car started now. Now! Who's this? Is she dead? No. Hurry! We've got company! OK, go. Fuck. What's your name? Tia. Where am I? We're just going up the road. We found you in the trunk of a car. What? I was... I was with my friends. What about all that cash? I don't know. I went to a meeting... ...with a man about an immigration issue. Take it easy. You've been drugged. It'll probably wear off soon. My fr... My friends... I think... I think they... I think... I think they killed them. She's out again. Look, do you have any idea what's going on here? Just get us to the next town. That sign back there says Bellingham in 50. Well, I live in East Bellingham. What the hell do I tell the cops if I'm stopped, huh? Do you have any idea who these people were that were shooting at us? I mean, for that matter, who are you? I don't think it really matters anymore. After you drop me off, just tell the cops whatever you want. Just give me a few hours to get into the wind. Well, my father'd disown me if I spoke to the cops, especially the ones from Bellingham. Is your father a gangster or something? Ex-con? Well, it's like I said, my father's not exactly an upstanding citizen. He sells cars that aren't necessarily for sale, if you know what I mean. I could relate to that. Hey. Welcome back. I wouldn't do that if I were you. We're going about 70 miles an hour. It's OK. We saved you from those guys back there. We don't mean you any harm. What do you mean "we", white boy? OK, technically, he did. I did drive the car, though. Are you going with him? Is she going with you? My advice is just drop her off at the first cop-shop. - No. I can't go to the local police. - No? Why's that? They're the ones who killed my friends. - Damn. - Look, I need to call my father. Not until we reach Bellingham, then you're free to do whatever you want. But I need help. Didn't you hear me? The cops killed my friends. My father will pay you if you help me. The problem is, I don't need any money. Got a whole bag of cash here. Maybe instead of money, your dad can get me the fuck out of America? - Could he do that? - He can. Yeah? Well, if you're so sure about that, I'II tell you what, son. Drop her and I off together, and then you park this piece of shit somewhere where nobody can see it and hightail it to the fuckin' moon. Maybe I can help. I know the town really well. My father's got connections. Just forget about us, man. Do what I said. - Hey. - Let's see what we got. Nice. Now you're a hero. Lay that dead kid so it looks like the chink killed him first. I want this whole thing tied up by the time the state boys get here. - You got it. Let's go. - Yeah, OK. Pull up over here, kid. AII right, listen. You're gonna get out here. Put as much distance as you can between yourself and the car. These guys are gonna come looking for you. They're gonna come looking hard, you hear? I'II wipe it down. They'll never trace it back to me. Thank you. Look, if you guys ever need anything, you go to Little Russia, you ask for Vlad. That's my father. He does some other business, too. AII right, man, be safe. Thanks. - Where you going? - I thought we were... Yeah, no, we're not going there. Come on. Wait. Wait for me. Here? Why? They catch that kid and we're fucked, and from him, they'll roll back to that other motel. You understand? You don't trust anyone, do you? It ain't about trust, it's about survival. Look, I need to call my father. I need to tell him I'm OK. Before you do that, I think you and I need to have a little talk. I already told you everything. What more do you want me to say? You told me that your friends were killed by local cops. That really doesn't explain to me how you ended up in a trunk next to a bag of cash. I already told you, it's not my money. What are you, deaf? I want you to shut the fuck up. I want you to pay attention and understand one thing. If I'm gonna try to save you, and if I'm gonna try to help you, you need to talk to me, you need to listen to what I say, when I say, how I say, and if you don't, I will leave you here to get eaten by the fuckin' jackals, who are coming soon. OK? OK. I'm sorry. If you want me to help you, you gotta talk to me, man. You gotta tell me straight, so I can know who's coming for us. You're right. You saved my life. - I guess I owe you the truth. - Well, the truth would be nice. I was trying to get my uncle into the country. Yeah, they're coming in now! I was contacted by someone who said they could help. - They want me to go inside alone. - I don't like this, Tia. I'II be OK. I was told to show up alone, but I insisted on bringing some of my friends since it was the first time we were meeting. The man I met is a Chinese drug smuggler only known to me as "Chen. " He told me that he would help smuggle my uncle into the United States. I should've known it was a trap. It was all my fault. I heard the shots. I was in shock. They forced me into a room where another man was waiting for me. He said that he was waiting for my uncle's arrival, and that I was going to be held for ransom until he got the information that he needed from my uncle. And then someone placed a cloth over my mouth. Why would your father send you alone to do this kind of thing? He didn't. I went against his wishes. It was his preference to keep trying to get my uncle here through legal channels. You see, I love my uncle, and I had to make sure that he escaped from China. - Escape from China? - My uncle is an accountant. He wanted out, but it's not the kind of job you can just quit. My uncle's involved with some senior members in the Chinese Army. These men are in charge of an area known as "the Golden Triangle," a place in Burma where the poppies are cultivated. Oh, I'm very familiar, very familiar. That's why he was denied entrance into the United States. - So he's on the watch list? - Yes. If he was an accountant, that means he knows where all the books are, what all the numbers are, where all the bodies are. They're not gonna let him go. That guy's worth his weight in gold. But he's a good man, Shane. And the man in the office, he's also Chinese? They called him "The Colonel. " Chinese military. What makes you say that? My father was a military adviser. I've been around the type my whole life. He asked me some questions about my uncle. Almost like he was trying to make sure I was who I said I was. I get it. I know what to do. I know what to do. - Ritchie, it's Clark. Come in. - Go for Ritchie. Over. Think we got it. OK, hang tight. I'll be there in ten. Where's my money? Where is my money? My money. What? Your money? No, no, no. The deal was, I get half the money up front, the other half when I give you the Uncle. That was my fucking money. Until he arrives, it's my money. And that girl, I need her to control the Uncle. You lost her, too. And I'm gonna get her back. You forget, the girl was a bonus. You better deliver this "bonus." If you want to do business with my backers, you need to be a little more responsible. Yeah. You find him. AII right, you take care of it. I gotta go. He angry? Chen... Please, I did my best. Who has my money? It wasn't my fault, Boss. What the fuck? Now answer my fucking question. Who has my money? And, more importantly, where is the girl? It was a big guy. Maybe Indian, I don't know. He took the money and he took the girl. The girl might remember how to get back here. We should go to the safe house. We have plenty of notice. The state cops have to go through Bellingham before they get here. What about the dead trooper? Ritchie should have a handle on that, right? - Yeah. - The local cops are in my pocket. Ritchie says he found the abandoned car in the center of town. He also said prints on the outside of the car belong to a dead Russian kid. Russian? Yeah. Russian. OK... OK. Well, you make sure Ritchie has a description of this Indian guy, you send him to the Russians and get him to talk to 'em, then you grab a few men, and you start searching the town. Nobody leaves without us knowing. Understood? Get the fuck out of here. You're bleeding all over my office. Russians and Indians? Chen says if the Russians are hiding this guy, you'd better make them give him up. - AII right. - Got it? Understood. I hate that little chink. Dmitri, two more! OK. Coming right up. - Yes? Go on. - Nothing to link back to us. Covered our tracks, covered the vehicle. I mean, we were just minding our own business, the cop pulled up and... We were a little freaked, so... you know, all of a sudden, these other two guys get out, and come out of nowhere. Markov heads off down the dock. I duck for cover. He should've stayed low. He should've just stayed low. - Instead he gets... - Hey, who's the guy in charge here? So the guy comes out of nowhere, and... I don't know, he seemed to help me out of the situation, so... ...just kind of rolled with it. I'm looking for the driver of a blue Suburban. People around here tell me you deal in cars. No. People probably tells you lots of things. But I bet most of it bullshit. Why don't you go back to your side of town, cowboy? We try to keep to ourselves here. Isn't that right? See? No ones here wants to whisper in a cop's ear. Some Eurotrash just about your age got himself killed down by the border line. Did you know him? Well, I don't know any Eurotrash, officer. I'm trying to finish my meal here... ...but I obviously can't do that with you standing here. The smells of you makes my stomach turn. I will cut your balls... ...and I will cut your throat, you understand? Hey, man, I'm a cop. We're fucking cops! Let me explain something to you. Where I come from, we fuck cops in the mouth when we run out of farm animals. If you want to lock us up after you count your dead, then don't forget that American jails is paradise to us. So think hard... before you jump. - We need this cleaned up. - AII right. What the fuck was that? We're just gonna walk away? That asshole just threatened you. Listen to me. We walk away for right now, all right? - This is their part of town. - Oh, give me a break. These fuckers are crazy! We can't take them all on, not the two of us, not right now. - We're the fucking law! - Listen to me! Soon as we handle this shit, I'm planning on paying him a little home visit. Oh, yeah. There's a place and a time for everything. Now get in the fuckin' car! So... this is drug money, unfortunately. And I don't know if you can read Chinese, but it's obviously Chinese drug money. So, I'm sure folks are looking for this real hard. Who are you? I mean, how do you know that? I... I was in the military for a long time. I was in the army, Special Forces. Had a great career, very colorful. One day, I lost it all when I got accused of something I didn't do. Did six years hard time. I was acquitted of all wrongdoing through DNA evidence. They found out I had nothing to do with that crime. I was let out recently, and... look at me, I'm already in trouble again. Fuck. So this is a transponder, which means people are probably closing in on us real quick, you know? Get down. Somebody's here. Let's go. Oh, God. I think I'm gonna be sick. Do it while you're running. My uncle's due to arrive today. I'm so worried what might happen to him. AII right. How you doing? You ever hear of a young man called Sergey? Never heard of him. He said that his father owns this place, someone called Vlad? News to me. Really? OK. Thank you. Let's go. This is a waste of time. Wait a minute. That's them! Those are Chen's men. Why don't you tell me what business you've got with Sergey? The boy owes me something. Why don't you check with the father? - What's in the bag? - None of your fucking business. Little Russia, everything my business. Well, how bad do you want to find out what's in the bag, boy? Who are you? Where is he? The shop. The shop! OK, let's go see your boss. Son of a bitch. These guys ain't with us. Whoever took them out's a professional. Found these. Weren't we just there? So the motel surveillance cameras gave us a tentative ID. Guy's name is Shane Daniels. He's just out of the joint. And guess what? He's ex-Special Forces. The guy's a fuckin' killing machine. Still doesn't explain why there's two dead Asians. Oh, and you're gonna love this. We found some kind of tracking device in the room, too. Maybe my friend is being a little less than honest. You want me to come back there and kill that piece of shit? No. I can handle him. So, if both ends of town are truly covered, then he's gotta be somewhere close. We shook down the Russians. They ain't talking. But our guy was there. Well, then you take the gloves off and you make the Russians talk! You sure you want to go there? They went there first. Colonel? The man we're looking for killed two Dadu. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? - No, I don't. - Liar. - Think before you act. - I am thinking, and I think those men were yours, and they were after my money. You deliver it, and then you try and steal it back? You are thinking too much. Well, no one's ever accused me of that before. - The Uncle arrives tonight. - I still don't have the girl. I'm aware of that, and I'II burn that fuckin' town to the ground unless they hand over the girl before dawn. Now, please... contact your people and tell them to deliver my money. Of course. I want you to go to the Russian's house. I want you to go around the back and fucking kill them, all right? - Yes. - He threatened my balls, and nobody threatens my balls... Yes, yes, Colonel. AII right, grab that bottle. Pour us a couple drinks over here. Oh, yeah. Perfect. Drink, Colonel? You say... You say you trust me, but you refuse to have a drink with me? AII right. More for me. Oh, yeah. AII right, enough. That's the guy. And he has the money. Go around the back, let yourselves in. Me and the boys will keep them busy. Let us know when you have them. - Yeah. - We're going in. Good. You get the money and the girl, you come back here. Understand? Understood. What about Mao? He can mop up. I need you back here to clean up a little mess of my own. Understood. - Come in quietly. - Got it. Here he is. Hey. I heard a lot about you. Please, sit down. Welcome to my home. Oh, yeah, man. Perfect. I heard a rumor about the Dadu, that they prefer to... each other? You know, I'm almost starting to think that it's true, you know, 'cause... 'Cause, look at these beautiful girls, they're just... They're just dancing around, and you're not even... You're not even looking at them. You're eating your food. This one, maybe you like her, huh? She's got the ass of a nine-year-old boy. Look at that. Maybe... Hey, hey. Maybe if you have a drink with me, I'II let you take her from behind. You'd like that, wouldn't you, Colonel? Where you going? Colonel, where you going? What? What? Did I hit a nerve? Where you going, buddy? Oh, baby, I think I hit a nerve. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Come on, come sit on Daddy. I owe this man my life, Father. In life, we fight wars for many things. We fight for our family, for our friends, and for our pride. But always maintain code of honor. Without that, life has no meaning. I understand that. Where is your family? My family's gone. I see that in your eyes. You are the man who put others ahead of himself, not to garner others' respect, but simply because it's your very nature. You saved my son and for that, I'm beyond grateful. Please tell me what you need. If it's within my power, I will make it happen. I don't like to start a fight unless I finish it and... After this, now they have her uncle. And if we don't step in, theyll kill him. That is a serious problem. Where was this place they had you? It was an abandoned mill about 50 miles out of town, not too far from the border. Chen's place. Very secluded. He likes to do business out there. So you know this man? Of course. What do you think? From now on, you're my brother. You son of a bitch. You should be dead by now. I just wanted to make sure the Uncle arrives before you screw that up, too. My associates will retaliate. You know, they rely on me to deliver their product across. There's... there's a lot of money at stake here. You think you matter? You think I was going to pay you? The only reason I came to you to intercept the Uncle was because you were easy to manipulate. And I was right. You think your Dadu background and training make you untouchable? It doesn't. He's coming. You'll see. The Dadu are the highest-ranked warriors of the Chinese people, something you know nothing about. I tell you what. I will do you a favor. I will unite you with your nine-year-old boy lover. Happy? Goddamn it! Did I hit a nerve? We're in. Don't make a sound. Answer me by nodding or shaking your head. Is the girl still here? - Is the man still with her? - Yes. - Fuck me. They know we're here. - Let her go! Fuck you! Put your fucking gun down. I said put your fucking gun down! Give me a couple more mags, man. AII right, I got these guys. You get the guys in the front. Sergey will take you down below. Save some for me. You guys keep going. I'II double back. It reminds me of the old days. Let's go! Get 'em out of here! I'II cover you. Tia! Ritchie, I've got her! We're coming out the side exit! Get the car ready! Tia, run. Who the fuck are you, huh? Fuck! It's me! It's me! AII right? Come on, let's go. This way. - But Shane is... - He can take care of himself, OK? Let's go. Come on. I fucking knew it. I told you. Shit! Fuck it. Come on, you fuckers. Sergey! Get down! - Get down! - Vlad, clear! That took balls, young man. You did good. You did well, Sergey. You did well. Shane? You've heard my speech, and now you've saved both of our lives. What I want to know is, how can I help you? I have friends all around the world. You have the cash. I can help you start a new life in a new place. Is that not what you wanted all along? Well, I'm gonna take care of her uncle, and then we'll talk. Then I will go with you on this as far as it goes. Great. I'm with you, too. I'm coming, too. So... let's go. Looks like they're dug in. Let's go join the party. Be on your toes. They're not answering the radio. You'd better pray the Uncle is here. Let me know when the charges are all set and ready. Let's go! - We are here. - Where the hell is Chen? That's him. That's my uncle. Wait a minute. We got another player here. It's an ambush. They won't have a chance. You finally did something right. The Uncle has arrived. Sergey! You go. Tia, stay low. I'm gonna go outflank them. - Shane! You're all right! - Let's go. Sergey! Give me a shirt and a coat from one of those dead guys right away. Quickly! You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right. You hear me? Talk to me. I know. Shane? - Yes, baby. - Am I gonna die? No. You're not gonna die. You hear me? You're not gonna die. AII right, listen to me. I got something to do. I'II be right back. OK... get on your left side. You OK? Stay just like this... you hear me? You all right? Sergey? Watch her for me. OK, baby, I'II be right back. - OK. - I'II be right back. We have to get out of here, OK? OK? I'm sorry about this. I'm sorry about this. Come on. Come on, now. Hang in there. Almost there, OK? Almost there. Come on. Right through here. Through here. Stay with me. Stay with me. Right here. OK? We're going down. We're going down, OK? OK, here you go. AII right, stay there. AII right, stay. Come in. Come on in. - Have a seat. - Maybe later. Who are you? What do you want? Well, unfortunately, in the fabricating of your plans, you inadvertently stepped into my minefield. And to answer the second part of your question, I want you dead. I did not believe you were that good until you dispatched my men. Very impressive. But let's get down to business, shall we? You want the old man? You pay with your life. You know, brother, where I come from, the definition of death is emptiness. If that's the case, I've been dead for a long, long, long time. Well, it looks like we're in a room with three dead men. AII right, let's go! Come on. Somebody wants to see you. Where... where is Shane? He's coming. He's coming, OK? He's on his way. He's coming, all right? OK? It's gonna be OK. Sergey! Shane, look out! Everybody's waiting for us downstairs. I've got something more important than that. Your smuggling days are over, that's for sure. Does that mean what I think it means? Guess what? Vlad just called, and your uncle can stay. Thank you, Shane... for everything. AII right, sweetheart, let's go celebrate. I got a new home.
