They were barbeque on the beach. Dan Rose, Tara, Jeremy. Wayne noticed it. Jeremy was gone. What happened to him? He went for a swim and hit by a boat. Dan got a little bit strange after the accident. I mean, who wouldn't? He just always had that ... that camera with him. Uh, I mean, he had it before, but he would use it for birthday parties... or school recitals things like that.br I went for a jog and I saw him in the backyard, just staring into the woods, just pointing the camera at nothing. So, did you get any calls regarding Dan Wittlocke or his wife's pryer through their disappearance? Yeah, I got a series calls from Dan claim there were some stalker in the woods outside of his home. I never saw anything. Dan? He did not hear in that. He began to wag and raving, and insisting there was a guy living in the trees on his property. If you ask me, the guy playing with the full deck there. Oops, sorry, I moved my hands. - No, that's okay. - Okay, that's alright. - That was pretty good. - A lot of we did that.

You see that? You see that? See what, Milo? Birthday girl's gonna be defeat. You see? There ... Look, there's somebody standingbrback there by the trees. - Look. - There. Yeah, there. Looks like a guy in suit. Hold on. Alright, just listen. Rose, I'm telling you. I look through the camera, he there. I look up, he's not there. I'm not lying. I don't know how's the put. Right, because you can only see him through the camera... I'm not crazy, you've seen it. I don't know how else to... Wait, what is that? Look. Right there. - What is that? - I didn't see it this one. I didn't see it. Is that it? Should we had to stop rewind and show it this tape to the police? I don't understand. Maybe he tried to and they were just tired enough of them. In the 60s there was that serial killer, do you remember? - What was his name? - Zodiac. - Yeah. - I used to make entire, you know, uh, code messages and the press to the police station. - So yeah, one of the most of them was actually... - Oh yeah. - with this little cross over it. - Yeah. So ... I don't know. I mean I guess that this guy was not that imaginative. You can always return an X. It is a similar symbol. - This guy... is a serial killer? - It could be. You know, we just found knives clean and blood in the kitchen. That thing is that the one trade most serial killer is, that they are somebody for a while and then they choose them. You know, and if this guy keeps popping up for the kids birthday in the woods in the backyard, I guess this is ridiculous thing to say. And in fact I have a friend in the Bureau in Boston. Let me see if I still have his numbers. Hang on. Yep. I'll giving a call, to see if something is ringing the bell. Are you okay? Hey, is Barbara pissed with us or that just your face looks like this all the time? - Hello, Barbara. - Hey. Oh yeah? Two hours late.
