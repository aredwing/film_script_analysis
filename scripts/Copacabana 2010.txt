You look like a whore. Can I have a menu, please? No, the fridge is full at home! How you talk to me! Bring me a menu. I'm not going home. I have the right to eat, don't I? I'll eat and go. And a Martini, please! Dream on! - What's the matter? - Nothing. A customer's giving me shit. Which one? - 'Night, Mum. - Where you going? Justin wants a steak at the Buffalo Grill. Nice dress. I've never seen that. Come here. It's gorgeous. You look beautiful. Justin, don't you think she deserves better than a grill? - Don't get lipstick on me. - I can't even kiss her anymore. I have something for you. A finishing touch. What did I do with it? I have to pause it. I'm making a Brazilian tape for Patrice. If he can even listen to it, now that the cops towed away his car. - Mum, we're late. - Two seconds. There! You can make a pretty bandana. It's great with your dress. Okay, see you later. - Sleeping here? - I don't think so. - Have fun. - You, too. - Bye. - Bye, Justin. Oh, Esmerelda! I have a job interview tomorrow! Cool! I think I'll go to bed early. It's at the candy store. She's at that ungrateful age. She's 22! She's not a kid anymore. That's what depresses me. She's an adult. She knows her mind and doesn't like me. Don't say that. I feel like she avoids me. We never eat together, we have nothing to share. It all started when we moved to Tourcoing. We always used to be inseparable. In Guadeloupe, it was great! Sure, she had friends. But after school, we'd go to the beach together. The problem is, in Tourcoing, the beach... Who cares about the beach? We were close. Yeah, I got that. The truth is, I've got to find a job and settle down. It's been ages since I gave her anything and... Even if she has a boyfriend, I should spoil her, show her I can take care of her. I put a quarter in the juke box hours ago! Give it time. Anyway, I'm crossing my fingers. I think I may have found something. How did your job interview go? Was it real estate? A fiasco! It was selling what they call "timeshare" apartments. I'd have had to move to Ostende... Without a car, I'm limited. I couldn't. Who cares? You'll find something. We've got what it takes to find something. Finally! Don't be mad. I'm dying to dance! Then I'll take you home. Patrice, stop! We're going Dutch! You always pay! Don't start, Babou. Let's just say it's for the tape. Even if I've got no player. - What's up, Babou? - Do I ask you questions? Shit. I came miles for your chocolates. Thank you, that's nice. I'd given up on you. I'm sorry, my car broke down. And the bus took forever. Anyway, I'm here. How can I rely on someone who's late for a job interview? It'll never happen again. I'm very punctual. Fine, but no. I'm sorry. please... You're an hour and a half late. I'm not hiring you. And look at your hair! Well, I ran here. That's not my problem. We had an appointment and you weren't here. You're responsible for your actions. Anyway, my response is based on that. Have a nice day. Excuse me. Have you tried our new specialty? They're cookies with cocoa and slivered almonds. What? I don't believe this. Are you crazy? She's nuts! Hello! Come on, sweetie. Let's walk, okay? Excuse me? You don't need a nanny, by any chance? No, I'm the nanny. "I'm the nanny." A concierge who rings your bell and asks for a Christmas gift? No way! It's up to the tenant! Slip her an envelope, if she deserves it. Come on, Patrice. She doesn't do shit. Your building's a pit. Last week we even had to put the garbage out. Am I tripping? Say, "Take 10 out of 20 and give me change." You're nice but you got taken! Hold on. What is it, Esme? I'm free for dinner tomorrow, if you are. I'll call you back. Sure, I'd love to! - Okay, see you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Hugs to Justin. Find something? No, they stripped the section. Just the dregs are left. How to Cook Offal, So what'd you get? Indian Flavors It's specific. I'll make do but ingredients will be hard to find. I always had a recipe file on my travels... in Israel, Spain. But I've moved so much I can't find it. Hey, this doesn't look bad! I'll just substitute shrimp for the squid. Squid's great. You can get it cheap, frozen. Esme doesn't like squid. I'm glad things are better. I was just venting. Her boyfriend's the problem. It'll never work. She'll dump him one day. He's so serious. Kind of a pain. Quiet! Some people are trying to work. Serious. - Hi. - That means "welcome" in Indian. You see, I planned a thematic evening. A cocktail to start. Thank you. Excuse me, I've got something on the stove. Saris are nice but impractical for frying. - Did you have a nice day? - Not bad. But I flunked my Latin test. Why do you have to take Latin when you're a contemporary lit major? Ask my advisor. I'm sure she'd love your advice. You're dumb. Is this invite for tonight? You wanna go? I thought we might stop by, if we're still awake. In that getup? It's more elegant than the local riffraff. I have a phonetics class at 8 AM. I'm not going nightclubbing. Next time. Cheers. I couldn't find cardamom at the discount store. - I've been wanting to talk to you. - Have some more. You're not listening. Yes, I am. You've been wanting to talk to me. Justin and I have decided to get married. please, don't start. I didn't say anything. Exactly. I can see that look on your face. You're not happy. Is that it? Mum, we've thought it over. I know you think it's bourgeois and superficial. But it's important to us. We want to do it and... we've made our decision. Don't you think you're a bit young to get married? If you'd been around and needed stability, I could understand. I've been around plenty with you! After all you put me through, can't I settle down? All I put you through! You'd think I had you robbing banks. Let's not rehash old times. All your schlepping around got me a shit education. Now I want to change all that. I want a normal life, I want to have a family. Can't you understand? I understand but I think it's a shame. I tried to open you up to the world and now you shut yourself in, as if... We're getting married near Amiens. Justin's parents found a nice place to have a party after church. It's a church wedding, too! Justin and his parents are into that. I don't mind. Have you picked a date? When I visited his parents. You could have consulted me. Justin's parents wanted to call you but I told them you were in Brazil. Pardon? They wanted you to chip in, so I said you'd gone to Rio. Now you won't have to pay anything. I'm a big girl. I can say I'm broke and irresponsible. How long do we have to keep up this farce? They'll talk to me about expenses at the wedding. Don't worry, they'll slip me the bill. I said you wouldn't be back in time. Are you crazy? Why create such a situation? I'd rather you didn't come. Why? I don't want to create any expenses for you and... And what? I don't want you to embarrass me. I embarrass you because I'm broke? No. I don't know. Sometimes... you seem crazy. I can control myself, too. Am I jumping on the table with straws up my nose? No, you're just in a sari. And Justin saw you come out of the candy store. You busted up the place. So that's it. A few bonbons on the floor and I'm persona non grata. It's not just that. At times, you're out of control. Yeah, I have a strong personality. Listen, Mum... As far as Justin's family goes, I swear, it's better if you don't come. Well... Okay. In that case, I'm not your mother anymore. - What are you doing? - Clearing the table! Go see Justin. Maybe he'll take you for a burger. It didn't use to be a problem. When I took her and her friends to a club for her 15th birthday, she wasn't too unhappy! Back then I was "way cool." "Awesome!" Now I'm crazy. Babou, don't get all worked up. Can I have the last one? What was that timeshare thing of yours? Would you consider moving to Ostende? Why not? What's to keep me here? My daughter wants to put me away, I'm in debt. But... I'm here. You... Why not come with me? We can work together. As for the car, we can take mine. Problem solved! Forget it. It's impossible. Why? Because after the interview, as I was leaving their office, I swiped a ream of paper from the photocopy machine. There was nobody around. I thought, "You can always use paper." Sometimes I like to draw at night. Did you get caught? Some girl apparently saw me. The bitch told the guy who interviewed me. He left me a message saying I wouldn't even be considered for the job. In other words, I shouldn't say you sent me. That may be less risky. Patrice! What are you doing? Stop! Have you lost your mind? Why ruin everything like that? Because I love you. Come on. We're friends. We're close. We're broke. But, shit, we're not in love. Speaking of being broke, could you lend me a few bucks? That pisses me off but I'd rather you ask that than kiss me. - Ten euros, how's that? - Fine. Instead of declaring your love, give me the number of that agency. Did my assistant offer you some coffee? I'm fine, thanks. So, your name is Elizabeth Delmotte... Yes, but everyone calls me Babou. I never liked the name Elizabeth much. It sounds like the Queen of England. I see. So, Babou, do you have any idea what a timeshare is? Yes, it's... They're apartments that are purchased weekly. Exactly. It's the part-time use of a property as a second home. When I lived in Spain, I was often approached about renting timeshare apartments. Right. It's a very successful system there. Our advantage is that we're pioneers in northern Europe. Everything's been settled about the restaurant coupons. Great! Do you know Babou Delmotte? No, not as yet. She may join the team. Wonderful. pleased to meet you. Oh, a little welcome kiss. Very good. Would you close the door please, Genevieve? We're recruiting people with some sales experience. Does this interest you, in theory? Absolutely. I'm not working at the moment, so I'm... looking for a job. Yes, it interests me a great deal. You should know that you'll be trained and housed on-site, in the apartments available. They're not all furnished yet. Our plan is to rapidly start selling those apartments, like hotcakes. Will the training be long? Let's say the training is ongoing. You'll quickly begin soliciting customers. Then you can take courses to improve yourself. We don't expect you to be at the top of your game right off the bat. I have been surprised. On one project, I had some very gifted people who didn't need class work. If I accept... Well, if you hire me, will I have to move to Ostende? Yes, for a while. Why? Do you have family obligations keeping you here? No, I'm free. Perfect. One more thing! You'll have to canvas in the vicinity. Which means you'll need a car. That's not on your rsum. Yes, I have a car. It's sort of out of commission but I can take care of that right away. If you think I came to borrow money, you're wrong. Why did you come? Here goes... I got a new job. I'm happy for you. Now you have to hold onto it. That's my intention. Sorry for the mess. I'm moving everything around. Why didn't you call? I figured if you saw my name, I'd go straight to voicemail. Clever! Classy! Can you help me? I want to put the sofa there. Wouldn't you rather... So you have a better idea. No, no! Okay. You know, Suzanne, it took a while but I think I've finally grown up. If you say so. So what is this job? I'm going to sell timeshare apartments. I see. You found dirty work, swindling people. Why do you say that? It's a very serious company. They're not beginners. This isn't bad. Nice view. - Not too Feng Shui! - You still into that? It leaves a big hole. How much are they paying you? I didn't want to get into that. You're expected to negotiate. I should be well paid. I'll get a fixed monthly salary, even during training. Plus a bonus for each unit I sell. What luxury! Where would you have put the sofa? I'd put it there. You get the view, plus it separates the living room and dining room. Obviously, once they're all sold, I'm back on the street. But they said they could transfer me. They want to be loyal to their staff and build a team. What? I have a bad feeling about all this. It'll be the same old story. You're always all hopped up at first. Then two days later, you take off. I told you, I've changed. This time I'm hanging in there. That's what you said about the massage internship. You lasted 30 minutes. With reason! The guy wanted us to undress to get to know our bodies. He was indicted and went to jail. And then that dress shop in Biarritz. You made your daughter move her senior year. Then came back two months later. Because the damn police shut us down for selling Cardin knockoffs. How could I have known? I'm still not convinced. I'm not convinced about the sofa either. Are you challenging me? I'm in! I've decided to see this through for Esmerelda. - I'll never get used to that name. - Why not? Naming your daughter after a bohemian dancer with a goat... The sofa's all wrong! Let's put it back there. If I knew I was coming to play moving man... Nobody forced you. Why aren't we friends anymore? Why do you think? I don't know. I don't get it. After your divorce, I came back from Guadeloupe and we saw each other all the time. We had a blast... - I don't know. - I don't disagree. You were funny, full of beans, smart, one of a kind. With you, life was a show. But did you listen to me? No. Were you interested in my life? No. Do you care what I think? No. Do you listen to me? Then you pigeonholed me as a bourgeois trapped by the system. That's not me. I'm not pinned down. I move furniture. If I want the bedroom here, I put the living room in there. Okay, okay. Shall we move the sofa? Now I want to change all that, I want us to find each other again. That's all I'm hoping for. Like I said, with this new job... I can't change my mind now. Now that she's getting married. Who's getting married? Esmerelda? To her marketing guy? Don't even try to dissuade her. She's crazy! That'll cost you a fortune. I know. But I have to chip in. Or at least give her a nice wedding present. I am her mother! - Want an apple? - No, thanks. Well, honey, you'll have to sell some apartments. When do you start? I leave on Sunday. Oh, I didn't tell you. The complex is in Ostende. I have to move there. The only problem is I have to have a car. So? I don't know what's going on but my car won't start anymore. So I figured, since you live in the city, you never use your car. Could I borrow it? Is this a joke? I don't have the cash to get mine fixed. I'll leave you my car, you get it fixed and I'll pay you back. You bet you will! - What? - Use your blinker when you pull out. Keep in touch. I'll bring you Belgian chocolates. Just bring my car back. Don't worry, Suzanne. And thanks again. Really. Once known as "the queen of beaches, " Ostende still bears its ancient lustre. Leopold II, "the Builder King, " made Ostende his vacation home, erecting prestigious buildings, like the ''Royal Galleries''. - Pardon? - Oh, you speak French? A real feast for the eyes! All this luxury isn't a dream. And it can be yours more easily than you think. My name's Katia. If you have a few moments, I'll show you around. Well, I... Don't worry. Looking doesn't cost a cent! Why deprive yourself? - It's just... - Are you in a hurry? We can always make an appointment. We're going to be co-workers. I've been hired to work here, too. Oh, okay. - How long have you been here? - I just arrived. Excuse me. Isn't all this marble impressive? My name's Katia. If you have a few moments, I can give you a tour. If it won't take long. Excuse me. - Do you know who I should see? - What? I don't know where to go. Is there someone I should see? Wait here, I'll be right back. Can't you see I have a customer? I'm sorry, I don't know where to go. No one's at reception. Did you try Lydie's office? Lydie? The sales coordinator. She's at the end of the hall. Thank you. It's no picnic hanging around here. Of course I'd rather be with you. No idea! She must still be on the road. Hold on. Are you Babou? She just got here. I'll call you back. Couldn't you call? I'm sorry, I don't have your number. Don't you check your messages? I left two. Do you think all I have to do is wait around for you? I'm sorry. They just told me to show up this afternoon. - Who told you that? - I don't know, someone at HQ. Fuck! Why? Is everyone else here? Yes. There are 4 of you. One guy's staying with friends in town. The other two got here this morning. Can I at least show her to her room? If you keep calling, I can't go any faster. Talk to you soon. My boyfriend's squawking, I haven't seen him all weekend. Where is that key? Here it is. - Follow me. - I left my things in the car. You can get them later. We're obviously still under construction. But that should be done soon. - The plan is to be ready by summer. - Of course. I don't know if your roommate's in. I hear the TV. We have roommates? They didn't tell you that either? Not many apartments are done, so it's kind of tight. But they're big, you each have your own room. Hello, Irene. All moved in? This is Babou, your roommate. Irene arrived... this morning. Are all the apartments identical? We also have studios and 1-bedrooms for up to 4 people. The sofas are all convertible beds. We'll go over all that tomorrow, when we're fresh. I'll give you a brochure with all the information. Irene took the big bed. You'll have to take the kids' room. That's okay. Anyway, they all have the same view. I still have a choice between bunks. Is there supposed to be only one TV station? Yes! The satellite dish hasn't been installed yet. These are your keys. That's for the apartment and that's for the front door at night. What else can I tell you? Get a feel for the place tonight. Tomorrow at 9, we meet in the conference room next to my office. Before I go, this is the laundry room. Washer, dryer, ironing board, steam iron, of course. Is this the bathroom door? No, the bathroom's near the apartment door. That's not practical. May I speak to you? What is it? I went up to the 11th floor and saw lots of finished studios. Why are we doubling up when we could each be in a studio? That wasn't my decision, it was management's. They thought it was less chaotic to put everyone on the same floor. But the floor they chose has mostly 2-bedroom apartments. Being on different floors wouldn't be chaotic. These apartments are for sale. The less spread out you are, the better. Do you understand? And we thought living together might be less disorienting. Popping up in a strange city can be tough. All the more reason to have peace and quiet. I'm going. Babou, come with me. I forgot the garage key. Be right back. Are these your kids? And my grandchildren. Do you feel like taking a walk, seeing the city? Having dinner somewhere? I'm not hungry. I'm tired. Fine... Good evening, ma'am. What's today's special? Steak with fries and... Oh, no! No steak. No meat. And what's the Noordzee soup? That's a bouillabaisse from the North Sea. It's not at all like a Marseille bouillabaisse. - But it's fish? - Yes. I'll have that. You'll see, honey, it's good. And to drink? A beer. Stella, Juplier, Duvel, Maes, Leffe? The least expensive. Thanks. Would you like to join us? No, thanks. I'm fine. Come on, don't eat all alone. Honestly, how dare she? She wants to give that to her kid. So? He asked for a Spider Man T-shirt. But he can't read. I'll just tell him it says Spider Man. That's awful! You can't give him a Jogging T-shirt and say it's Spider Man. What if he's got friends who can read? When he finds out, he'll hate you. Today, my daughter hates me. And for a lot less than that. Why? What did you do? I don't wanna talk about it. She's back! What happened? They gave me the wrong key. I can't get in. Maybe you're not strong enough. It's funny, I was just saying I shouldn't have let you go and you came back, saying you were locked out. Right, very funny. It's not the right key. Now what the fuck will I do? I can't call my boss. I already got in trouble once. I think you'll have to stay at my place. Do you have a guest room? We can work that out. Did you like it? Yeah, I did. It's 4 AM, I'm supposed to start at 9. I like that, too. I'll drop you off. That's nice of you. Okay, bedtime! Hi. Excuse me, I don't have anything to write on. Can I borrow some paper? Sure. Thank you. Do you need a pen, too? Yes, please. My name's Babou. I'm Amandine. And that's called "boomerang." Your job isn't complicated. It's to boost sales. Obviously, you have to learn quickly. We can't train you for months. We're not saying we won't train you. We'll train you. That's understood. But our priority is bringing people in. So, at first, you'll simply be soliciting people. Approach them on the street, at the beach, the casino. That's up to you. That's your job. But what I expect... what we expect is that you get them to come here. Through that door, to be won over by our sales staff. Is that clear? Meaning we do the dirty work. They sit around while we freeze our asses off to deliver clients on a silver platter. Irene, you're not qualified to handle sales from A to Z. You don't have the experience of Aureilen or Katia or Daphne, who've been here for over a year. But you get a bonus for every sale closed with a client you solicited. That's why we're distributing folders containing business cards. When you approach anyone, be sure to hand them one with your first name written on it, so we can identify which of you led them here. Okay? You'll forget about all us, once you get your mitts on a customer. Anyone who stops by from now on will inevitably be sent by you. We promise not to take advantage of you. Then why not have confidence in us now? We may be just as qualified as Daphne, Katia... I have 12 years experience in real estate. I didn't just come here to beat the bushes. I don't want to instigate things but I quit my job. The people who recruited us misled us. Listen! The door's wide open. If you're not happy, you can go. Okay, Irene? Are you still with us? Babou, we haven't heard from you. I'm staying. They know what they're doing. We couldn't start right away. In any case, if they said to me, "Tomorrow, "you have to sell apartments," I couldn't do that. I've never done this before, I don't know anything. When you look at Lydie or Katia, there's a big difference. They're clearly professionals. Like everything, in any field. You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs. Right? And how did you wind up here? Like everyone, I guess. I need cash. What did you do before? If you want my life story, a lunch break's not long enough. No, the short version. Well, the short version... It all depended on who I met. I traveled a lot. For your job? Not necessarily. I sort of bummed around. But how'd you earn a living? I think we ought to get back. The brochures are nice. I'll see you inside. - Why are you here? - I was in the neighbourhood. Katia said you were at lunch. Her name's Katia, right? These are for you. - This morning's catch! - That's sweet. I'm glad to see you. How's it going? Fine. Aren't you supposed to be at work? Yeah, but the boat I have to unload is late. I'm going back at 3. - I have to go. - Are you free this evening? I can pick you up and show you around town. I should work. They gave us a lot of stuff to review. I'd rather have a quiet evening. We could spend a quiet evening together, too. Listen, Bart, I just got here... This job's important to me. Call me when you need a break. Okay. Don't be angry but we're doing sales simulations... The shrimp will be in my way. No problem. Bye. See you soon. Grandma's away on a job. She'll be back soon. I miss you, too. Give me a big kiss. I want to hear it. That's not a big kiss! It's a little kiss. Come on, a big smacker! Bigger! That's better. That was a big kiss. You're nuts. You're talking to yourself. I'm nuts? You lost the bag of food! I'm sure you left it on the tram! You were stoned! Shit! Chill out. please, sit down. Hello. I thought you might be hungry. I made pasta. With pesto. In case you're allergic to nuts. - You okay? Not too cold? - No, it's okay. Yes, Esmerelda. No big deal. Is there a problem? Listen, you made it clear that I don't mean much to you. You said I embarrassed you, that you wanted space. I got the message. In Ostende, Belgium. I got a job here. Hold on. What? - You woke me up. - Sorry. I have no sockets in my room, I had to put it here. It's not the hour for calls. When I was working, you drove me nuts for 3 hours with your grandkids. Did I say anything? That's it. Slam it harder. Bitch. My roommate. Remember the bitch in Misery?. Identical. Worse! Sir, would you be interested in... No? Might you be interested in looking at... Hello, madam... - Hi, how are you? - Fine. Sorry about last night. I didn't even thank you. Oh, no problem. - How was the pasta? - Good. Want your plate back? Right now? No, you can keep it. Or throw it away. Very chic today. This is Kurt, ma'am. And I'm Sophie. My name's Babou. Call me Babou. Does it ease your conscience to toss us scraps? Don't start. Gimme a break! She's just a fat bourgeois do-gooder. Me, a fat bourgeois? You don't know me, punk. Excuse him. He can't help acting like a hot shot. I can see that. Have a nice day. What a jerk! Did you have to insult her? I'm not a fat bourgeois. - You look beautiful. - Hi. Want to buy a timeshare apartment in Ostende? I already have an apartment. Plus, I can stay in it all year long. Why? Having a hard time? Worse. They all blow me off and laugh in my face. This isn't the place to approach people. You should go after tourists. Have you tried the Zeebruges harbor? Ferries come in from England. I'm happy. I made up with my daughter. - Cool! - She's coming to see me on Sunday. Great! So, miss taciturn! You spent the night with Bart? News travels fast! This is a small village. I called him yesterday and he told me. Did he say he came to see me at work? I advised him to do that. You're a pain! Why? He was whining, said he couldn't stop thinking of you. I need space. I didn't come here for a boyfriend. You're making a mistake. Bart's a great guy. - He's romantic. - Petra, that's not why I'm here. Plus, he snores. As we say here... - What does that mean? - It'll work out. Thank you. You come up empty and Babou sends us 17 people in one day. It doesn't compute. Irene, you can't stop talking about your real estate experience. Twelve years with... what agency? - De Havilland. - In Saint-Cloud! And you couldn't even send us one prospect! I see why they let you go! Jacques, can't your Ostende friends help? What's the problem? Are you scared to run into them? No, the problem is the minute I say "timeshare" people take off. People are suspicious. Do you hear that? "People are suspicious." It's your job to persuade them, to demystify this new way of vacationing. So you have to move your ass. How do you think it happened in Portugal? In the Canary Islands? It didn't happen like that. They had to convince people. And persevere. But there it's sunny every day. Here, two weeks a year. Wasn't it sunny today? I know it's off-season, there aren't many tourists, and that timeshares have a bad reputation. But! Babou managed to send us 17 people. Do I have to draw you a picture? Wait for me! I'm just leaving now. Can you do the shopping once in a while? We can eat out. Or order in. - Have a nice evening. - You, too! Keep up the good work! Okay, I'll go to the supermarket. What do you want? Chicken nuggets. And as a side dish? - What's that? Looks good. - A pepper omelet. - How do you do it? - There's not enough for two. I wasn't trying to mooch. I just wanted to chat. But if you prefer, we can keep ignoring each other. I'd prefer that. In that case, take all your photos out of the living room. This is a common space. You've appropriated it. After grabbing the big bed. I may be moving to Amandine's apartment anyway. Funny, with her, you've got lots of things to share. But you act like I'm a bitch. Let's not go that far. We just don't hit it off. You can't have everything! You can't be my friend and teacher's pet. So that's it. We have to choose sides. Sharks on one side, Jets on the other. It's a gang war. Watch your omelet. When they burn, they're disgusting. - Follow me! - Where? You can stay in one of the studios. But we can't leave our dog. Bring him. Keep him on a leash. Hurry! We'll go through the garage. It's less risky. Make sure it's back in order by 8. - Okay. - You have a cell phone? - An alarm clock? - Yeah. If anybody finds out, I'm screwed. - Can I count on you? - We promise! Kurt, are we in agreement? You'll be out by 8 AM? No problemo. Here's the key for the garage. You can return it tomorrow. That's so nice. It's only natural. Got a joint, Kurt? Yeah. The fat bourgeois is slumming tonight. You do this. Babou, you have to... Your phone kept ringing. I answered. It was your daughter. Sorry. Good night. Hi, Babou! Have a nice evening. What if a client stumbles over your cables? From now on, when we give tours, I want all this out of here. We're not playing leapfrog in the halls. Okay, you can go. Am I right or am I right? So how'd it go today? - Twelve people. - Not as good as yesterday. But that's not bad. Good news. The Irish couple you approached yesterday came by today. They're taking 2 weeks in April. - I get a bonus? - And Katia. She gave the tour. That's great news! Headquarters. Yes, Stephan. It's going fine... Everything okay? Here's your key. - No problems this morning? - Smooth as silk. - The garage was empty. - Perfect. Thanks again. We even took a bath. Great! I have to go. Hold on. I rolled you some reefer. In case you feel like chilling. That's sweet. - Can I help you? - No, no... I didn't know if we'd finished our conversation. I think so. I confirmed the bonus. Yes. That why you're happy? No, I just spoke to management. They gave me a week off. So I can go skiing. - You like to ski? - My boyfriend does. Now I can go with him. Listen, you won't broadcast that you saw me dancing around? I don't have many friends around here. Oh, I forgot! I don't want to overdo it... But could I have a small advance? My daughter's coming to see me on Sunday. Is 200 okay? More than enough, yes. Again... Mum's the word! - I went through Brussels. - I'll pay for the ticket. - Forget it, Mum. - No, Esmerelda, today's on me! - You won't believe what I did. - What? - I didn't buy a ticket. - Stop! I can be rebellious, too! Give me a kiss! I'm proud of you. I wish you were that happy about my wedding. I told you I'm happy you're getting married. Now if you'd just invite me to the wedding! My in-laws think you're on the other side of the world. Say I came back for my daughter's wedding! They'll understand that. - You really didn't pay? - That amazes you. It's freezing. I need another sweater. Let's stop by my place. I'll lend you one. They've thought of everything. Except the faucets. That's the cold water, that's the hot. For warm water, you figure it out. What do you tell clients? I don't give tours. I just solicit people on the street. In this cold, you have to beat the bushes! Thankfully, I have my little tricks. Do you wear support stockings now? What a horror! My old roommate! She must have forgotten them. Too bad for her! In the trash! Let's go. I reserved at a great restaurant. I left my money in my suit. Wait here, I'll be right back. - I have good instincts. - I thought she was nice at first. You're not too sharp. She's obviously a real shark. I'm onto those dames. All smiles, then you get taken. That's Babou! All she cares about is making money. So she wants us out of her way. She's merciless. They learn that in business school. - She never went to business school. - So she says. I say she's got tons of degrees. That said, she was very secretive. Jacques thinks she had a business that went bankrupt. And now she's going into real estate. In fact, she's a mole. Checking out the competition. Oh, hi! Have you met? That's my daughter, Esmerelda. - Shall we? - I'm ready. Have a nice day! That's my old roommate. The short one. Nice place, isn't it? - Are we waiting for someone? - I invited some friends. Here they are. They're really nice. They leave for England today. I wanted you to meet them. - Sophie's your age. Cool, huh? - Cool. Excuse me, may I have a bowl of water? For my dog. - Right away. - Thank you. - This is great. - It should be. They say it's the best in town. It's agreed. Order whatever you want. It all looks delicious. Can you afford this? Don't worry. Order whatever you like. It'll be a change from those disgusting waffles. Open your mouth, Kurt. I never noticed that tongue ring. - Did you see that? - I saw it. - Isn't it annoying? - No, it's pleasant actually. Wasn't it painful to get? No more than a blood sample. The next day's hard, when your tongue swells up. You can't talk. You take liquids or suck on ice to bring it down. I had a chocolate sundae. But I forgot about the nuts. I immediately confused the nuts with my piercing. Can we order? A guy picked us up but he went wrong way. It took us two days to go 150 km. When we got there, they said we needed a pass. - That cost 100 euros. - That stuff kills me! Bands don't make a cent on those concerts. It all goes to the record companies. Anyway, we didn't let them take us for suckers. I had a brilliant idea. Wait! Let them guess. I don't know. Any ideas? You gave blow jobs in the toilet maybe? - Are you okay, Esmerelda? - No, I'm not. Esmerelda! What's the matter? Enough is enough! I come here to spend Sunday with you and wind up with these losers droning on about all their bullshit. And you're completely gaga, drinking in their every word! "She plays djembe? How great!" You're pathetic. What's the big deal? I don't get it. If they were slightly original... But they're a dime a dozen. You find hordes of them at any rave. Well, if I had to count on you to make conversation... You refused to talk about your wedding. You changed the subject. Because I knew it would open the floodgates to more stupid jokes. That's your probiem. You pigeonhoie peopie. They're getting married, too. As bizarre as that may seem. But since I have a daughter who judges my friends, my lifestyle... You know why I like them? Because they're fun. - They're young and free. - Free of what? - They have to beg for food. - So? You think you're free? You're scared of your boyfriend. I bet you didn't even say you were coming. I came to this dump for you. To show you I could hold onto a job. But I see I can't prove anything to you. You think I'm a failure and we have nothing to share. What more can I say? Go! Go back to your in-laws, to your little love nest. Go watch TV with your guy. - And I pigeonhole people? - Isn't that the life you dream of? My dream was to spend just one day alone with you. But that's not enough or entertaining enough! I'm going home. You're still in Brazil, thousands of miles away. Does this tram go to the train station? Wait! I wanted to take you to the aquarium. The aquarium? Why not a puppet show? You okay? Yeah, fine. No kidding! We should go. Our ferry leaves in 30 minutes. I understand. One ticket for Lille, please. Hi! Oh, right... two. Can I take your coat? I'm glad you called. I didn't expect it. If you don't mind, I'd rather just fuck. I don't mind. How did you lose your finger? A work-related accident. We have portage engines, but dock work is still pretty physical. I think my back's gonna give out every day. If you saw the loads we carry! But if I play my cards right, in a year, they'll let me manage the warehouse. Then I can take a breather. Do you wanna do it again? Right now? You're more exhausting than any cargo I've had. Babou, wake up! You'll be late. I don't care. Let me sleep. Come on, Babou. You have to go to work. I don't care! I don't give a damn about that job anymore. Listen... I'm counting to three. I warn you, if you don't get up, I'll throw you out of bed. One... two... three! - Sorry. - No big deal. Take a seat. So, where was I? I was saying that Katia broke her leg. It's not serious but she can't work this week. So Martial and I discussed it and called headquarters. They agree that one of you should replace her. We obviously need someone efficient, someone who's a quick study. We rapidly came to the conclusion that Babou was our obvious choice. Her figures testify to that. She did what she was asked to do. As they say, it's no contest! The bitch did it again. Is there a problem? Speak up. Why not save your chitchat to attract customers? Isn't that more useful? They do shit then want to be rewarded. Is that how much I'll be paid now? I see why they're pissed. When Katia comes back, will I be back on the street? Don't panic. If you do a good job, there's no reason we'd put you out there. Initial it there, too, please. Be sure to mention that the sofa's a convertible bed. But avoid opening it. Last time, it took me so long I blew the sale. If need be, lift the pillows, show them the mechanism, then move on. They won't be the wiser. Vlad, what did I say last time? Isn't it enough that Katia broke her leg? I can't believe it! This is a studio. They're really tiny. So focus on the view. Tell them all the balconies are the same size. They usually like that. They figure they get the same benefits for less money. How does this work? Is this screwed up, too? Vlad! I think it's the whatchamacallit. Oh, yeah. Thanks. There! It's big. I'll send Stephan a memo, asking for a sign that reads, "stroller parking." - What's that? - Look! Finally! Not bad. They're great! I was afraid the logo was too small. See, the yellow's eye-catching. - Nice. - Really nice. Yeah, they're great. Babou, what do you think? Nice. Very nice. I think I'll take a little walk. Notice the detail. The curtains, for example, match the bedspread. High quality bedding. Quite firm, quite comfortable. Try it. It does feel good. They're nice at that age. They treat you like shit later. Shall we go see the kitchen? That's great for you! And it's going well? One family said they'd mull it over. Then I had an English couple I brought in. I think they'll bite. We'll get their answer tomorrow. - Hats off! You're doing well. - Not that I care. Why do you say that? You'll make money. You can spoil your daughter. I'm not going to her wedding. She doesn't want me there. They'll slam the church doors on me. Aren't you going a little overboard? You have a communication problem. She just wants to see you. She may have to wait a while. Because now... I have other plans. Really? What plans, may I ask? Brazil. A trip. As soon as I get a little cash... I'm outta here! I'll just pack up and go. You can live on nothing there. I just have to learn the language... and I'll be on easy street. You're up. Lane 3. What difference does it make? See you around. What? Don't you want me to come? - No. - Why? Listen, Babou, what do I get out of all this? All you seem to need is a cock on two legs. I have a lot more to offer. I have feelings, I have a heart. So do I. Really? Did you think of me when you planned your trip? Don't you have cargo to unload? Yeah, right, I've got my cargo. Ciao! - Are you dumping me? - Yeah. Have you noticed I'm in bad shape? Go easy on me. Why? Do you go easy on me? You just use me. I'm your sex object. - Isn't that flattering? - Maybe. But it's not enough for me. I'm too old to be a pinup. Let's go home and cuddle. - No. - We'll just hug under the covers. No, it's over. You act like miss revolutionary and this is the result. - You're all alone. - You all piss me off! One acts like I've got the plague and the other whines about being a sex object. Some guys would love that. Go ahead. Nothing's stopping you. Find yourself another stud. A little modesty. And let me make one thing clear. You're not dumping me, I'm leaving. Okay? Can I speak to my daughter, please? - She's not here. - I know she is! I just drove 150 km to see her. I want to speak to her. I told you she's not here. We had a fight. She's staying with her friend, Sonia. Really? A serious fight? She won't get married. When she got back from Ostende, I sensed that... she wasn't in a good mood. I asked but she refused to say anything. I didn't push it. I told her about my day. About the wedding preparations, the menu I chose, all that. She was irritated that I chose a meat dish. She said not everyone likes meat. Okay. I didn't want to argue. I agreed. If she preferred fish, fine. Then things really went downhill. I said, seeing how expensive the wedding would be, maybe we should postpone the honeymoon. At that point, she lost me. She said I wanted to imprison her, I just wanted to sit around and watch TV. - She refused to be my maid. - And what did you say? What could I say? She was screaming, so I screamed louder. Have you called her since? No! Shouldn't she be the one to call? Do you want her back or not? Hello, Esme, it's me. Did I wake you? No. What do you want? - To see how you are. - I'm fine, thanks. I've thought things over. All your worries about the wedding and all... I understand. I don't want you to think I'm trying to trap you or stifle you. If you don't want to get married, if you think it's too soon, if you're afraid, we can wait. It's not a punishment. If we get married, I don't want us to feel like we can't budge. I want us to do lots of things, but together. Always together. Esme? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Is that all? Justin? I miss you. I miss you, too. I want to see you. I can come and get you. See you soon. I think she liked that. I know. I know my daughter. Thanks! Italian design. Machine-washable slip covers. I won't open it. You can do that. Let's go out on the balcony. Watch your eyes! The view is extraordinary! Just breathe in that sea air. Some people pay a lot for that. - What are you doing here? - Babou! We're back. They turned us back at the border. Because of him. Those assholes were afraid he had rabies. And since we didn't have some paper signed by a vet, they stuck us in some office. For 48 hours. - When'd you get back? - Just now. It was either that or stick Ecstasy in a kennel. So what are you gonna do? We're gonna find a vet to sign their lousy paper and take another boat. Tomorrow. Maybe. You poor things. What a story. Where you staying? We'll try that guy who put us up last week. Take the garage key, in case you can't reach him. That's sweet, but we'll manage. Don't worry. Take it. After 10, it's a morgue there. Everyone's asleep. Irene! Dead, huh? Why don't you go down to the Zeebruges harbor? With all those ferries, there's bound to be lots of tourists. Anyway, it's up to you! Easy on the champagne! I'll get drunk. Are we celebrating this sale or not? Okay! Didn't I say I'd be home late? Try listening to me. We can watch a DVD tomorrow. You're a pain. I've had it! - I hung up on him. - Bravo! Now, for some real peace, turn off your cell phone. You just had to ask. Career-wise, things went downhill. I found stuff but I was never really happy. And are you happy with us? Isn't that obvious? Plus you promoted me. I've certainly got no complaints. I don't believe it! We're happy, too. Things are picking up. We're getting back on our feet. We flipped earlier. Irene brought in 14 people! We were thinking of firing her. Fourteen people? My goodness! I hope that'll make her a little nicer. Look! Isn't that tempting? - What? The show? - Come on, it'll be fun. I'm sorry, the show doesn't open till tomorrow. But the casino is open. No, we wanted to see the show. Aren't the dancers here yet? Can't they do a show just for us? Sorry, they arrive tomorrow. What a shame. I love Brazilian music. I love anything Brazilian, in fact! I've traveled a lot but never there. Maybe that's why it's always fascinated me. Brazil... - Rio? - There's Rio de Janeiro... Look what I found. I'd completely forgotten. - What are those lights? - A power plant, I think. In fact, I've never known. It looks more like a city. Let's pretend it's Rio. - I can't steer it! - Go this way or we'll get stuck. I love this! Look! The lights are on on the 11th floor. How is that possible? No one's on the 11th floor. There are people. I'm not that stoned! I put them in one of the studios. - What? - It's a young couple. Homeless. I said they could sleep there. It's the second night. It's so cold, I felt sorry for them. Are you mad? No. You were right to do that. They should serve some purpose. I told them to be out by 8, so they wouldn't be seen. I was afraid they'd run into you. Why? Do I seem that mean? I didn't know you. I see. I'm glad you told me. I prefer it. But you're not mad? You sure? No, I'm not angry. I was surprised, that's all. And it's true, it's bitter cold... - I'm freezing. Can't we go back? - Love to! - But will we make it? - We'll try. Morning, Babou. Would you come with me, please? But I have to give a tour now. Come with me. Have a seat. Do you have any idea what I have to say? No. Is Katia coming back? Am I back on the street? Babou, we hired you to bring people in. Then to show the apartments, so as to sell them. As you've seen, we clearly trusted you. We weren't disappointed. You did very well. Only... If I recall correctly - tell me if I'm wrong - neither Lydie nor I nor anyone asked you to house the poor just because we had empty apartments. We agree, you alone decided to do that without consulting us? What you've done is inexcusable and forces us to fire you for misconduct. Effective immediately. Here's an envelope with what we owe you in cash. Bonuses included. Lydie insisted on that. There's a 200 euro deduction. Probably for an advance you received. If you could just sign these documents, attesting to the fact that we paid you and that we owe you nothing more. And mark it "read and approved." The problem is my English isn't very good. - I told you that. - Yes, but we have French speaking tourists as well... There are Swiss... Place your bets. Can I put it all on the same square? So... Four. Do I give it to you like this? Thank you. The bets are placed. - Can I still change? - Yes. Put it all on 14. Bets are closed! Fourteen red, even, low. - I won? - 35 times your bet. That's huge! Absolutely. I can do it. The angel. The bride! Thanks. See you later. Justin... - Have you seen my mother? - No. Did you know about this? - You speak Brazilian now? - Yes! Tonight we play Nancy. I've never been there. What do you think of curly top? Him? Not bad. Why? No reason. See you inside... My baby. I love you. Ciao. Bon voyage. Processing by B.B.
