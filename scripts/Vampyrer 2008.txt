Okay, l don't know who it was. ls it here, or the next one? Can't you tell me? NOT LlKE OTHERS There's some for you too. l don't know how long, exactly. An hour and a half, two at most. Yes, great. We'll meet up afterwards. Can you make it? Yeah. No, l haven't had the time yet. l think she's still sleeping. l will do it soon. Yes. Okay, good bye. Me, too. Bye. -Did you get yourself a phone? -Yes. -What do you need that for? -lt might come in handy. -For what? -For making calls. l was thinking about going to the movies tonight -l don't want to go. -Well, you don't have to come along. l want to go dancing. How about we go here? And then we can go to the movies later. Yeah, okay. You have poor eating habits. ''Poor eating habits''? Are you from the 50s? Yeah, you go ahead and make jokes. -You don't need that much food. -That's not the point. You don't get it. You're always depressed, so you're never hungry. Even you can get fat if you eat too much. l don't think there's any risk of that. -You saw Mom at the end. -She was genetically predisposed. -And you aren't? -No. -How do you know? -l've got Dad's genes. -Oh, you do? -Yes, l do. The way you eat, we can always hope. You think it shows? Hello? Hello? Stop! -And promise me you'll tell me. -What? -lf l start to gain weight. -Maybe. Why ''maybe''? Maybe. -Stop bothering me. -But why ''maybe''? -Because. -So you wouldn't say anything? -We might not always be together. -Of course we will. You don't know that. You're not little anymore. What difference does that make? l don't know if l want to go on like this. Like what? -Living like this. -There aren't that many other ways. -You said so yourself. -Yes there are and l want to try. What? -To live like them. -But you can't! -They'll figure out what you are... -Maybe, but it's worth a shot. l've heard that others managed it. Finally they just blended in. But...how will you live? How will you eat? Have you thought of that? There are other things. They don't taste good, but keep you alive. -Wait. -Go away, l'll be alright. -There are many things we could do. -Such as? -We could go to a club. -We could? We can find one that doesn't have a cover charge. -l don't know. -Don't you want to? -That's not what l said. -What, then? -That l don't know. -Can't you just answer? lt's usually not much fun. Are we just supposed to sit there? How about the movies? We can sneak in when it's started. l do that all the time. -Then what will we do? -l don't know. Enjoy nature! Hi! Hello. Thanks for just leaving. How much did we get? l'd like to have some. -Why do you always have the money? -You just spend it all right away. No, l don't. -Look, the train! Let's scream! -Knock it off. Come on! Would you like a taxi? Where to? -Can you just drive around a bit? -Okay. Are you sure you don't want to go somewhere? Uh...just drive a bit. Do you have money? Well, no. And you didn't realize that until now? -lt was just... -You think l drive people for fun? No. lt's just that l... -What do we do now? -l don't know. Do you have any ideas? No, alright. l'm sorry. l apologize. Are you sure you don't want me to drive you somewhere? -Are you sure? -Yes. Say where you want to go. Okay, you can take me to the other side of the bridge. No problem. l'm sorry about that. lt would be better if you have money next time. Mostly for my sake. l'm married. l can't just be paid in any old currency... And you. Do you have a boyfriend? No. Girlfriend? No. Alright, l got you. No attachments. Just family. lt's better that way. -Just a sister. -No parents? l'm sorry, that's none of my business. Sorry. -So, you live with her? -Yes. -ls that working out okay? -Yeah. -You two agree on things? -Yeah. l never agreed with my siblings. We fought all the time. But next day, at least when we were little, it all blew over. And then you're best friends again, right? -You never fight? -All the time. -And you still live together? -Yeah. -So you couldn't find an apartment? -No, we didn't want to live alone. -Really, never? -Never. For now, maybe. But you'll get married and have kids. Then it's a different story. You won't want to be together forever. Why not? So, does your sister look as good as you do? What? No, she is much better looking. Well, well... Okay. We're here now. Ah, wait. Just a bit, wait. l've driven you quite a bit. And you don't have any money. So don't you think l'm worth a little something? What, that's it? So, what, then? You're cute. So very cute. You're like a little doll. And l...had to drive quite a distance, so... Don't you think l'm worth a bit more than just a kiss on the cheek? -Right? Come here. -But... Stop. Let me go. Let me go! -Come on! -Okay. Okay. But let me go. Let go. Okay. Okay. Come on, then. -So you would just leave me? -Not 'just'. There's a reason. -What reason? -lt doesn't matter. -Of course it matters! -Not to you. You don't get it. -Because l'm too young? -Because you're a psychopath. -What? -Or that you are not like me. A big fat narcissist? -What have l done to you? -What have you done? Nothing. But still, you're thinking of just leaving me. -Not everything is about you. -Well, what is it about, then? -This. -The movie? All of this life. lt's pointless. -Oh, not this again. -What? You're just depressed. lt'll pass. Not now, l'm doing something. And don't say l'm depressed. l'm not. l've never been so happy in my life. Yes, you're absolutely bubbling over. -And still you'll just ignore me? -l'm not ignoring you. -Yes you are! -Shut up! There's a movie playing. Shut your mouth or leave. Damned idiots. Show a little respect for the other people here. Let's go. You don't get it. There's no point in talking about it. Then tell me the truth. -l am doing that... -Nice try. l know how you are. -So, you know everything? -You're hiding something. -Not at all. -Tell me! -What? -Tell me! -Okay. You want to hear it? -Yes. l've met someone. And? -He's not like us. -What? l know. There's no point. lt'll never work. -How do you know? Did you try? -Not me, personally. -See? -They'll figure out what you are. Then it's end of story and you're locked up. At best! You don't know that. We're not like them. They hate us! They hate us. -Not all of them. -Yes, all of them! Not him. He doesn't know what you are and you can't know him, not yet. -l know. -You can't know. -You can see for yourself. -How? He's coming here. -Now? -After the movie. We're leaving together. Don't be sad. l'm not sad. Where are you going? We don't know. Just away somewhere. -Are you okay? -Yes, of course. You can't smoke in here. -Okay, let's go outside. -l'm staying here. Okay, l'll come for a little while. Come on! Vera! Vera! Vera! We don't need to run now. l'm sure they've lost us. -No, come on! -lt's safe here. -Come on, we can't stay here! -l just have to make a call. You can do that later. -Dammit, give me that! -Come on, now! Oh, Vanja has to call her Prince Charming. What will you say? ''l'm a little late-'' ''-because l'm being chased by motorcycles, you see.'' ''And why is that?'', he wonders. ''Well, you see, my little sister was hungry.'' ''l understand. Maybe you can explain it.'' Yes. She smokes too much pot and gets all stupid. Do you always have to think that everyone is against you? -Maybe he's not like you. -How do you mean? You believe absolutely everything. And why do l do that? Because if he says that he loves you, then you'll believe it, right? -And l shouldn't? -No. Everyone has ulterior motives. They say one thing, mean another and want a third. -Everyone has them? -Yes. Even you? Not me. Did you know they were waiting for us out there? Who? Vanja? Fucking bastard! Stop it! Stop! Stop it. What is it? Leave me be... Why did you lure me out there? -How could l know they were there? -Don't lie. But you seem completely out of it. l can't talk to you. -So what was l supposed to do? -Nothing. You would have done the same thing. You'll thank me for this later anyway. You are unbelievable! l'm going to thank you for ruining my one chance to get away from you? ls that what you think? Okay. l thought you were a little down and had strange ideas. l thought it would pass. lt will pass. See if you can find another way out. l'll stay here. Come. We can get out over there. -lt won't work. -Yes, it will. -They'll catch us when l'm like this. -We have to try! That's just stupid. Wait here. We're out of options. Come on, l'll help you get down. Okay. Run as fast as you can. What? What are you doing? Run, you'll be okay. -What? Get down here. -l'll follow. Are you sure? l'm sure. Come on, you cunts.
