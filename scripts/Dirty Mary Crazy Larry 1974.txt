It'll be all right. Terrific. I even brought my own bag. Try not to squash the tomatoes. And you cease to be a family man right then and there. Hi, asshole. What did you do with the keys? She ought to be paid like one, right? If you don't give me those keys, i'm going to pop you. Oh! That's right, lady. Now, let's have the keys. Okay. Relax. Those were the keys to my grandfather's pickup. You just holler. Did you see that crazy son of a bitch? - You won't yell? You promise? - Uh-huh. I'm trusting you now no. Would you go back to your office now? Mr. Stanton? You better check with the stewardess in tourist section. Get in. As full of shit as that, huh? Honest, i was spouting off to a dial tone.

I'm glad! Your friend's a real dazzler. D-a-z-z-l-e-r. Okay, hang on. You know what it means when somebody like me gets off to a bad start? Not a god-damn thing. You've been holding those cars over my head a year and i'm getting tired of it. It's got nothing to do with you or you getting your new patrol cars. Kiss my ass. That's not nice. Sheriff's department, please, right away. I'd like to get out and look at the car. Oh, just beautiful. Yeah. Thanks. Come on. Let's get this turkey under-cover. - Yes, sir. - "Yes, sir. Yes, sir."

Tell 'em how you went to europe with jamie richardson. - Mister, she's gonna talk. - So what? Check the map for that second turn. - Where'd you put it? - Under the seat. Have you gone crazy? It's not here. That's what i'm going to break. - Hi. - Hi. Hand it over. Oh, sure. Why not? - Then you- - get in. Car 10 in hot pursuit. What, are you worried you can't outdrive him? Don't mean a thing. She always overheats. Come on, baby! God damn it, let's go. I ain't blowing nothin', partner. Whoo! Tappets. Contact that helicopter. Tell them to meet me at beacon's corner. Yeah, well we're going to get right back on it. Headquarters calling captain franklin. Give me that thing. Franklin, this is donahue. Come in, please. Donahue: Everett, i want you to get back to headquarters now. Everett, aren't you taking this pursuit a little bit personal? What's that supposed to mean? That's all you got in your brain is having the biggest troop in this state. I want you to catch 'em. - Hey, carl? - What? Kiss my ass! I was given orders to hit it and get it, and i follow orders. Let's go. There she is. Then we'll get the tools. Come on. - I said i'll be back in a minute. - Oh. I'll take it. Why don't you watch out what you're doing? Mm-hmm. What's the matter, mary? Ain't we good enough for you anymore? Same old technique. Whew! Look what i got you. Hey, there's a blue chevy. Hey, i think we should go. Car 20 to headquarters. - Which way are they headed? - Fryman road area, south. Notify all of the cars to make a sweep in that area. Uh, i might not be able to hear them pipes. Did anybody see a license number? Hey, had a black racing stripe. Mmm! Larry: Well, well, well. Hi, guys. They're about four miles south of miner road. Oh, shit. Officer: Son of a- now, what did that billboard say? That means he's gonna set up roadblocks. Where are you? All right. Listen to this. Unlimited. The roadblock at old 99 junction is now set up, sir. Hey, what do you know? A landing spot. Aphrodisiac, huh? With you around? Hey, that's $1.85. Computer. Shit. Lots of green between those balls, you know? This table's kind of screwy, too. When deke shoots pool, he's so loaded, he usuall y can't see the table. Hey now, bunky, that ain't an excuse to go on a binge, you know. Ain't no drunk costin g me another race. You walk now, mister, and we'll hang it up for good. I think maybe we ought to go. No sign of them yet, sir. Over. 18 minutes since your call. Over. Maybe that clown got us wired. Give me a piece of paper and a pencil. - Little miss mary's gonna do us a favor. - Why should i? Well, because i'm asking you to. Okay. What is it? Let's gas up and get out of here. Over and out. Ooh-whee! Hey, hold it! Swing off and pass. - Bunky! Hey, bunky, cheer up! All right, get me to that walnut grove. - What you slow down for?! - He wants to play. I think someone's knocking on the door. I hope he's a good sailor. Give me that mic. If you really get it on, you may be able to cover 15. Listen to him. It's just a matter of when. Now, get off that line. We haven't got any fuel left. You probably did. Let's go fix up the front end. Hey, wait a minute. Fix up the front end? Yeah. I got a way. Maybe you can save yourself, mary. Don't you do that again, ever. If she has any sense about her, i won't need to. To get up by yourself, you don't think anybody can, huh? Come on! Say it again! Just fix the god damn wheel. Hey! Wait a minute! Why? I'm his mechanic so what? You don't have to be. Well, i mean, you said half the money's yours, right? You and i, we could- it's not that at all. Well, i do lie a little. But the reason i lie... i know you, miss mary. You do? I mean, you're good. Even i know that. I drank myself right out of the entire circuit. I don't have anything else to do. Yeah, but i always think that. Now, let's get on with our business. Just hold on to them. Be right with you. I'm gonna stick right up your ass this time, buddy. Hang on. I think we got a mover here. I'm gonna eat your lunch, you long-haired faggot. He's staying with you. You'd better get, and i'm gonna put you right up against the wall. - If he gets any closer, i'm gonna lunch him. - Come on! Shake him! - Yeah. - I'm gonna powder his face. It's gonna take more than that to dust me off 'cause this is where i came from. I'm going to show you my twice-piped system, buddy! Keep going, partner, 'cause my top end is unlimited. Damn. And the steering wheel's loose anyway. Get me over there. Come on. You're just wasting gas. - All right. It's up to you. - What is? - I want 'em stopped. - Stoppedhow? 'Cause i'm going to give it a try. So go on down there. I said go on down there! Come on! Let me talk to him. This ain't no dirt track, roundy-rounder. Come on! I believe you're right. Crash into him! - Fuel! - Come on! - We're out of fuel! - God damn it! Go ahead and set it down! All you got to be is willing to take it to the max. Those cars ain't within 10 miles of where he's talking. What's he doing? Mary: And you go right. Jeez. From your coordinate, r-3 and walnut. Two up and left again. He's trying to make 'em outdrive themselves. One over, left! Okay. Two up, left. Hey, bunky, he's strokingyou. Yeah, but i'd like to call not collect. It sure looks that way. Time i always thought that we were friends time but you slipped right through my hands.
