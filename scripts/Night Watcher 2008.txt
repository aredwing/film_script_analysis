Listen, I didn't say anything. Nothing happened. She just got mad. - Oh, she got mad? Got? - Yeah, got. You're gonna have to think of something to say to her. You're apologizing. - Fine, whatever. - You guys... It's nice to know that there are others out here who have had the same kinds of experiences, who've been through the same kind of feelings. It can be very hard to relate to people about a suicide in the family. Sometimes you just need to talk to people who understand. There are some feelings that a lot of people, even your very best friends, are not gonna be able to relate to. Well, we were supposed to have a couple of new people here today, but it looks like a couple of them couldn't quite make it. So we only have one... one new link in our chain. What we usually do when we have a new member is a self-introductory type of thing. Okay. Whenever you're ready. My name is Angela. Hi, Angela. And... I guess the reason I'm here is because... Hi. Are you Brian? Yeah. Continue. You always have to take the bus? What? Oh, no. I do it sometimes to save money on gas. Oh. I used to always have to take the bus when I was little. I hated it. It made me really anxious, you know? I felt like I was gonna miss my stop. I always got nervous that I was gonna miss my stop. It's really stressful. But it's one of those it's-the-least-l-can-do sort of things, you know... riding the bus, that is. Why were you late? Missed the bus. No, you didn't. I just was, I guess. My name is Brian. I knew that already. Oh, yeah. You're Angela. I knew that already also. Who was it? My dad. You? My mom. I'm sorry. Well, good luck on the bus, Angela. Don't get lost, okay? Thank you so much. I guess I'll see you next time? I'm probably not going back again if I can help it. Yeah, I don't want to either. Really? No. - Well... - I mean, I guess. I don't know, I haven't really thought about it. Well, do you want to talk about our sorrows elsewhere then? Like where? Like online? No, definitely not online. Well, not like a date, right? Just out. Are you seeing someone? No. Are you? I probably wouldn't be asking you if I were, right? - Hey, Brent. - Morning, Angela. How's the security business? Sorry to hear about your mother. Thanks for helping us out, lan. That's really great of you. Angela, hi. Hi, Mr. Lopes. I didn't know if you had class or something. No, I'm just here for you. Oh, I didn't know I was so special. No, I mean I scheduled this meeting with you because I need to know what's going on with you. I know. I'm trying to get... Do you work? No, I don't. Just to be honest with you, Angela, you're not gonna pass this class the way things are going. It's not the quality of your work. You're not too stupid for this class. It's just that you don't turn anything in. At the same time, I can't cut you any slack because you haven't given me a reason to cut you any slack, you know? L... I don't know. I know, I know. It's just... My God. My mother died really recently. She wasn't old or anything. She... killed herself. And, you know, my dad's, like, not in my life. We're sort of not on speaking terms. I'm sorry. It's okay. I can sympathize. I lost my daughter Beth recently. She had tonsillitis, you know, which usually isn't very serious, but things just kind of... they went wrong. And she... she left us. And she was nine... nine years old. It was really hard. I'm so sorry. So I can unders... I understand. I understand how it can be really really hard. Well... I'm glad you told me what's going on with you, okay? I guess I can cut you a little slack now. Come here. - Bad? - No, it's annoying. - What did you get? - B-minus, which is so stupid. I hate that guy. If I had to find a new roommate, I would never put up one of these ads. They're so weird. Aren't they weird, Ange? Um, I would never answer one. I don't think they're weird. Well, the reason why you wouldn't answer one is 'cause they're so weird. I guess. People put some crazy stuff up here. Oh my God. What? Your message. I thought you already got that. No. I know. It's so sad. God, when did this happen? A couple of days ago at the beach. It's hard to tell with Katherine, though, you know? Hey. How was work? How was work? Fucking amazing. How was sitting alone in the apartment? Actually, you know what I did today? I bought cigarettes and went to the bank. Did you rob the bank? No. Pity. I'm gonna go change. You got something today. There's no address on it. Someone must have, like, dropped it off or something. I just heard. I just can't believe she would do something like that. Oh, honey, what is it? Happens all the time, you know... there's statistics... everywhere. I know. More people kill themselves than each other. There's more suicides than homicides. You know what that means, Angela? You can't be alone. You're safer living with a complete stranger than with yourself. You can't run from yourself, though. You can't escape it. Angela, what's going on? I'm sorry, Garrett... I mean, Mr. Lopes. I can't really stay, but I just wanted to stop by. What are you doing? I just... I don't think I'm gonna be able to get my... I mean, maybe, but I don't think that I'm gonna be able to get your intro paragraph in on time. Things are happening. Well, thank you for letting me know, Angela. Sure, yeah. I mean, I'll just try and email it to you when I get a chance or something... soon, I mean. Just get it to me when you can. Thanks. I never know if we're supposed to wait for the check or go up to the front. I thought you'd never been here before. Oh, well, yeah. But I mean at places like this, I guess. I don't know. Check, please. What? You go on lots of dates, don't you? You don't? Well, no. Let's just say for the sake of, I don't know... say that... Okay, let's say... ...that you were on a date right now. - Right this moment? - Right this moment. - With you? - With me or anyone. It doesn't matter. Okay. What would you do right now? Well, hmm. I would probably try to get to know you or her, so I might ask, I don't know... - what's your favorite...? - Chinese. I thought it wasn't you. What's yours? Italian. Well, they had pasta. I don't like pasta. But your favorite food's Italian? That's weird. No, that's an interesting fact about me... a fact that might make you think that I am a unique and interesting person. And you are the only person here that knows that about me at this very moment. And that is what's gonna make you like me. Okay, your turn. Okay. Um, let's see... Oh, my mom and I used to send messages in a bottle, like, all the time. What were the messages? I don't know. I don't remember. I wish I did. Did you put your contact information on them? Shut up. You're making fun of my interesting fact. Do you still do it... I mean, send a message? No, after my mom died I just got so mad at her that I never went back to the beach. It's like it cheated me or something, you know? Maybe if you forgave her... I don't want to. You should. It's better. How did it happen? Can I ask that? She slit her throat. Oh my God. Wow. Yeah, I know. In the kitchen. I found her. I'm sorry. What about your dad? He put his head in the oven. I didn't think people really did that. Me neither. Did she leave a note? No. Doesn't make any sense, you know. Doctors are supposed to help people. My dad was a doctor at Hunter General. Same with my mom. Maybe they knew each other. - There must be something off, you know? - What? They did it at the same time, both doctors. I don't know. It's the hospital. That place must have done something to them. - Maybe if we went... - No no. Yeah, let's go to the hospital. Maybe we can find something out. I can't go there. I can't go to the places where she's been. I can't touch the things that she's touched. I can't. If I tell you something, do you promise not to tell anyone? Who would I tell? Seriously. Of course. I mean, it's not a big deal. It's just... What? I mean, seriously, it's probably nothing. Well, you should tell me. You know, I'm not gonna tell you because if I told you then I'm making it a big deal. And if I don't tell you it's like it never happened. So just forget it. You should tell me. No. Fine. Don't. You can't do that, you know. What? Say something provocative and then not tell me. Provocative? You know what I mean. What if I tell you something? Then will you tell me? I guess so. What? I got... I got this tape. Of your dad? - Yeah. - Me too, of my mom. - What's going on? - I don't know, but why would somebody videotape our parents? Why would somebody do that? I don't know. Angela, I think... I think maybe my dad didn't... like, maybe somebody else did. What? Come on, like somebody killed him? It just doesn't make sense to me any other way. I guess I'm just confused, you know? I don't know. Maybe... maybe somebody's trying to help us. Listen, we're gonna be fine, okay? I'm glad you're here. I can't believe I just said that. I'm not really used to this sort of thing. You're doing fine. Thanks. I should go. Okay, I'm gonna go. I get off work at 7:00. I'll come over. Yeah, okay. Lock the door, okay? - Shut up. - I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, bye. You know. Are you happy? Sure. "I'm out bowling with the buddies, baby." When did you plan on telling me all this? Shut up, Lisa. I don't have to tell you every fucking thing that I do. You know, you bore me! You know what? Why don't you get off your fucking high horse? It's just a fucking hobby. Sure, like it's so hard to believe that I might want to know what my husband does in his spare time. Are you happy? You're doing this to my life. Shut up, Lisa. You shut up. You fucking shut your hole. Shut up. I just don't feel safe here by myself. Babe, I know. I know you don't. You know what? Everything is gonna be fine, okay? I'll stay here until Brian gets home. And we'll just watch a movie and paint our nails. And I'll make dinner, okay? And you'll never ever ever have to be alone again, okay? My wife and I want to get back there as soon as we can. It's the most beautiful city you've ever seen. Is it? It's just gorgeous. Are you back in school now, Brian? Excuse me? - Are you in school? - No. I don't know. I guess I just really haven't been thinking about it too much recently, you know? Do you know what you want to do? I want to drive a taxi. Yeah? A taxi? I know a guy who drives a taxi. I can give you his number. Yeah, that would be really great. Definitely give me his number. You got it. You left your phone here yesterday. Do you have it now? Yeah, it's on the table. Where was it? In the kitchen. Oh, yeah. I remember leaving it on the counter. That is, like, the third time I've had to replace this thing. Thanks for finding it. No problem. All right, I'm taking off. Oh. You got a hot date? Something like that. I have to catch the bus. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Are you sure? Brian is gonna be here in, like, a minute. I'll be fine. Really? Yes, really. Brit, you've been really great. Oh... Oh, and I'm really sorry about all this. Please don't stay you're sorry. You're my friend. You don't need to say sorry. Okay. Promise me you won't say sorry to me again. Brit, he's gonna be here any minute. I don't want you to meet him yet. Are you trying to replace me? Of course not. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Bye bye bye bye. Hi. I didn't see this the first time. It was on mine too. The same exact thing? Yeah. So that's your dad? Are you mad at me for some reason? - Babe. - No. What is going on? I hate this. I'm terrified. My life is terrifying. This is not a good time for me to be alone. You're not. I know. What's wrong? Lan committed suicide last night. I don't think he did it. I don't think he did it. What did they say? He suffocated himself in the car. It wasn't even his house. God, this fucking sucks. I think I know who took the picture. He usually comes back from work right before I go to school. He's a security guard. What about his wife? Just about to leave. Okay, so how long do we have? At least 15 minutes. I don't know if I can do this. We have to do this, okay? There's no better time. I think they have a key around here somewhere. Hey, put that down. What are we doing here? What else can we do? Oh, you're so annoying. You're annoying. What are you...? - Whatever. - Whatever. - What are you doing? - I was just trying to distract him. I just came by to tell you that I don't think I can come back to your class right now. Okay. - What happened. - I told him. I shouldn't have told him. He didn't believe me. Angela, of course he didn't. No one will. I thought he would. Sweetie, let's go to your house, okay? I really don't want to go back there right now. Could we please just go to yours? Of course. It's okay. We're gonna get through this, okay? Please no. I can't. We went into his house. We can't go to the police. Lan wouldn't kill himself. - Maybe he did. - No. Brian. - I took one of the tapes. - Brian. It has to be him, Angela. I had to be sure. - Why would he...? - Hey, guys. Hey, Graham. Hey, Angey. Oh, sorry. Hey, Graham. Wait a second. How... did I introduce you guys? What? Yeah, the other day she was over. No, I wasn't. Maybe it was someone else. I guess I just figured we had met 'cause I'd seen you so many times walk in and out of... I guess that's your room? Yeah, that's my room. How did you know her name? You must have told me. No, I didn't. Maybe she just looks like an Angela. I don't fucking know. Yeah, but you called me Angey. It's a fucking nickname. You know what, Graham? I'm sorry, man, can you get out of here, please? All right. Jesus. See you soon, Angelique. Hello. Hey, I'm at your house. Huh-uh. I was on my way to my mom's and I wanted to stop here and see you first. It was open. Yeah. Where are you at? Oh, of course. Be safe, Ange. Hello? I can't hear anymore. Ange, if you're saying something, I can't hear anymore. I'm hanging up. Bye. She was at my house. Inside? Yeah. Look at this. This is the tape I pulled from his house. Help me. Help. Help. Help. What? What what? No. Okay. Listen... You want a granola bar? Is it late? Is Graham home? I don't know. His door is always closed. What? I don't think I want to go in. What's up? I just don't want to. Then why are we here, Angela? I don't know, but I don't want to go in. Why? I haven't been here since the burial. What's going on? I don't understand. - I'm still mad at her. - So? I'm not ready to forgive her. You have to. I don't have to. Why do I have to? I don't want to, so why do I have to? She made a commitment to her life when she had me, which she completely ignored when she left me. Your dad left too, didn't he? Yeah, well, I don't need him, okay? Maybe she didn't need to live anymore, but I needed her too. And she should have been thinking about that. And she just left me. Whatever, Angela. It doesn't matter anymore, okay? What are you gonna do, huh? Are you just gonna stay mad at her forever? When people ask you you're just gonna say, "My mom died. I've never been to her grave"? Why do you care what I do? Because apparently there's something between us. Hey, I know what's going on with you. I've been there. I'm currently there. I'm gonna be bold here, Angela, and I'm gonna say that someone killed my dad. I believe that. And you can either take things the way you have been all this time and stay stuck in this... I don't know what it is... rut, I guess. Or you can at the very least admit that there's something else going on here. Someone hates us. I don't know, maybe you can ask her for an apology. Where are you going? My mom's this way. Are you gonna be okay? Are you? I'll see you soon. Brian! - I got a... - I got a tape. It's okay, come on. We're gonna be fine. It's okay, come on. We're gonna be fine. Come on, it's okay. Come on, we'll be fine. Come on, we've got to get back to the car. Come on. - I'm coming. - We'll be fine, okay? We've got to get back to the car. Don't worry. We'll be fine, okay? Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on, let's go. I'm coming. We'll be fine. We've got to get back to the car, come on. We'll be fine. Come on, let's go. Let's go, come on. Let's go. Come on, baby. Let's go. We've got to get back to the car. - It's fine. We'll be fine. - He's gonna kill us. We gotta keep on driving for a while, okay? What does he want? What the fuck does he want? Why does he hate us? Why did he kill my mom? I have to call her again. I have to call Brit. Hey, Brit. Brit? It wasn't Brit. What is it? A car. Is it his? The headlights are off. Don't. It's not that dark. It's dark. It's okay. He's gone. What the fuck was that? - I don't know. Jesus. - Something in your trunk? No. I don't know, maybe. Fuck. Oh, God. Jesus Christ. We have to stop. What is that? We have to stop. I think your tire blew. What's happening? We need to keep on driving, okay? But the spare's under him. Is this the one? I think so. It's weird. It hasn't been that long. I think we should go. Where can we go? Find someone. And tell them that we have my dead neighbor in the trunk with a gun? If we get back on the road, he'll kills us. We're not any safer if we stay here. Yeah, but... if I leave it's like I never forgave her for dying. I can't do that. Okay. The moon's big tonight. I can't tell if it's full. I never can. I think it is. It's usually foggy. You can't see the moon most nights. You came here at night? We went all the time. Even now... I just want you to know that I'm glad I met you. I'm glad I met you too. - Angela. - Mm? It's morning. Let's go. But I'm so comfortable. Come on, let's go. Her name was Beth. Don't bother screaming, okay? Because no one's gonna hear you... no neighbors. You have no right to be crying. Sorry. Shut up! See, that's the thing... no one ever apologized to me, not once. So what do I owe you? Hmm? What? What do I owe you? I owe you nothing. I owe you hell. They took it all. They took everything I loved. It was tonsillitis. Tonsillitis. Can you fucking believe that? It's not even a real disease. I'm sorry. Shut up! It didn't happen to me. It happened to her. That's Beth. My life was destroyed because of two fucking people. - I'm sorry. - Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. See, that's why I did it this way... to keep you safe, you know, so nobody would ever know. They would just have to guess and make up little stories about why their children or their parents hated their lives. We didn't do anything to you. And what did my daughter do? You are too stupid for this class. It's not about what you did. It's about what your parents did. They destroyed my daughter's life. And now I'm gonna destroy yours. No. No. I've taken everyone you love. And now I'm gonna take you. No. It should have been a normal procedure, Angela. So couldn't your parents have done their jobs? No, it wasn't their fault. It was an accident. Maybe it was worse than what they thought. No no no no. Your parents... they killed her. They destroyed my family. They destroyed my life, Angela... my life, my life. You get one. My life! What would you have me do? - Your family owes me this. - No no. You owe me this. No no. No. Baby girl, listen to me. Just listen to Daddy, please. Please listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Angela! Angela! You could join her. What? See her again. What are you saying? Take your life and see her right now. I know how you feel. And I know you don't blame me, but I hate my life too. I know what it's like to feel alone. You could see Beth right now. I know. I'll take you first. What did you write? My contact information. So what do we do? I don't know. Do you, like, throw it in? You just leave it in the waves. Let's throw it. You want to throw it? Aren't you gonna watch it? We don't watch it.
