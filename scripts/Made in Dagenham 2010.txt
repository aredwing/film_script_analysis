Eileen, you got more support there than the Arsenal. At least I ain't got bee stings for tits. Oh, all right. Cheeky. Desmond Dekker stirring up a storm with "Israelites" on the hottest day of the year so far. So girls, don't forget your bikinis and try and stay cool. Here we go. Connie? When you get a moment, can you just have a walkthrough? Just give me five minutes to settle in. Morning. Morning, morning. Everything all right? Yeah, I overslept. How's George? Don't ask. I've been up half the night. You're all right, you've got time. Man! Ladies, if I could interrupt you a second... - Come on. Cover up. - Please, ladies behave. Cover yourselves. Cover yourselves up. Oh, here he is. What if your husbands saw you? What would they say, eh? Come on, girls, this is important! Thank you, Connie. Thank you. Shut up! Now, shut up. Do you wanna hear what I gotta say or not? Yeah. Right. Now, listen. To quote Winston Churchill himself, this ain't the end. It ain't even the beginning of the end. Oh, for fuck's sake, get on with it. Get on! Look, ladies, please. I'm doing my best. Oh, come on. Now, the deadline we set the management to respond to our complaint about how they've regarded you unskilled... Shh! has now passed. Shut up! Which means you've gotta vote on the threat we made in the original communiqu. An immediate ban on all overtime. Right? And a one-day stoppage to take place on the 29th of May. All right? You got that? Right, now, those for industrial action, hands up. Yes. Against? Full house! I'm seeing the management tomorrow morning, and I shall inform them of your decision. Isn't he gorgeous? We did it. First time for everything. Fuck them. Every other bugger goes on strike, why shouldn't we? Just don't put it like that if you get interviewed by David Frost. David Frost. I know what you think about him. It's a bit scary, isn't it? I feel quite proud of us. You should. I fought Rommel in the war, you know? I wasn't once scared like I am when I walk in there, I tell you. - Happy birthday, Sandra. - Thanks, Eddie. Isn't it lovely what they did? Come on, get up. Are you coming, George? No. Go on then. Come on, you come. Connie. Spoilsport. Happy birthday, darling. - Thanks. - Happy birthday. Have a wonderful time. Thanks, Albert. Oh, leave it out, Dave! It's all right, it's the fuse box. Calm down. Of course it's the bleeding fuse box. Right. Oh, no, here he goes. Altogether now. It's bloody Liberace. Oh, God. Where do you reckon Brenda's got to? Where do you think? You're joking. No. Your trim. That'll be hanging right off in a week or two. And I bet I know the girl what sewed it, and all. Come on, then. Chop-chop, or we'll miss the buffet. Want another one, anyone? I'll have one. Yeah. George? No. I'll be up all night. Come on, mate. Connie, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Please. Come on. Just a little one. G & T, half a mild. Dave? Salt. Whole lemons. Who's next on the dance floor? You sure you don't wanna sit down, Sandra? Are you joking? I want a snowball. George, you ain't even tripped the old, uh... Come on. No, no, no. It's all right. Please. Do you mind, George, if I have this one? Like to keep me hand in. Jitterbug, twist, all them. You be careful. We need you on top form tomorrow. What you talking about? Fantastic. - No, no, no. Not being funny. - All right. All right. - Good night. - Thanks. Sandra. Sandra. Sleep well. Sandra. Happy birthday. - Good night. - Be good. Hang on. I don't live here. Wait. What? Now, what was that for? Nothing. I just like you, that's all. Yeah? Come here. Hey. What are you doing? Not out here. You're better than that, are you? Actually, yeah, I am. Graham? Graham. Breakfast. There you go. I don't feel very well. Don't you? You're not hot. It's my stomach. Okay, what's wrong with your hand? Nothing. Well, give us a look, then. No. I never done nothing. Honest. Mr. Clarke again? It'll be fine, okay? Now, eat some breakfast and get dressed. I'll deal with it. Sharon? Chop-chop. Eddie. Come on, lover boy. No, no, just clear off, I'm dying. We're all dying. We've all gotta go to work. Eddie? Oh, you cheeky cow. Come here. God. Balls. Balls, balls, balls. Bollocks. Yes? Mr. Clarke? Can I have a word? Of course. How can I help? You hit my son. On his hand. Caned him. And it ain't the first time. Yes. O'Grady. I remember. Forgot his protractor. And it isn't the first ti... Don't care whether it's the hundredth time. I don't want you doing it. You live on the estate, don't you? I don't see what that's got... We find boys who come to us from the estate often have difficulty in adjusting to the standards of behavior required in a school like this. It isn't really their fault. Their parents have never undergone the full rigor of academic life. The boys can hardly look to them for guidance, can they? But they do adapt in time. And I'm sure your son will too, if he's just given the chance. But thank you for your concern, Mrs. O'Grady. Are you all right? Fuck off. Hold on, is this Sandra's? Yeah, I know. Connie? Con? Sandra's at it again, look. You've gotta say something. She hasn't. You've gotta talk to her. Don't wave at us, silly cow. We're moaning about you. I'll do it. No, you can't keep covering for her. I'll talk to her. Will you? Here it comes. Oh, no. Look at that. We might as well not have a roof. How many times have we asked to fix this? It's not difficult, is it? Connie, listen. Albert. I'm sorry, I didn't realize. Oh, my God. - I didn't realize. I'm sorry. Oh, God. - You were saying? There's a meeting tomorrow. At Ford's headquarters down in Warley. You're joking. I'm not. Machinists threatening strike action, they couldn't believe it. - Oh, yes. - Yeah. We'll have to make a good strategy. They'll have Hopkins and Jones and Grant, miserable sod. Now, who have we got on our side? We've got, um, Monty Taylor from the head office, he's coming. There's me, two. You, Con, three. Well, that leaves us one short. Why? Little principle I picked up in the war, Eileen. Turn up with more on your side than they've got on their side and turn up when they're least expecting it. So who's gonna make the fourth man? Oh, not me. I'm not going. Any takers? No? You want it? Fuck off. Come on. It's a day off. - Oh, actually. - Yeah, you all wanna go now. Yeah. I ain't having that. What? Yeah. Go on, Rita. Day off. Go on, Rita. You'd be great, Rita. Go on, then. Yeah, right. What do you have to do? All right, Gordon? Hello, Sandra. Think you're going? It's the new Escort. Finally designed something people like. They can get fucked. That's right. We ain't working no overtime. Me and the boys were saying we'd have gone on strike just having to turn up in a pig hole like this. You know it's raining here, don't you? Yeah, yeah. Whatever. - See you tomorrow, Connie. - I think he likes you. It's going, it's going. The police are being pushed backwards. There's screaming now. Absolute hysteria. Now you can see the banners are being used as clubs... No, they don't want so much. No, look what you're doing... Sharon? Don't open my share. Turn the telly off now, there's a good girl. Now, please. Wake your dad up. Wake up, Dad. Right. Pull your finger out. Help your mum. Square eyes, what have I told you? Dad, Martine Clarke's got color. I've seen it. Martine Clarke's got color, has she? We'll go around her house and watch it after tea, won't we? Her mum'll be pleased. Look, we'll have color soon. Once you can rent them. Eddie, don't go promising color. We haven't even paid for the fridge yet. And the three piece is still on tick. Now we've got all this unrest at work. What unrest? Oh, that? You had a vote, Rita. Unrest is when you actually come out and strike. Blimey. No, don't look like that. I'm only joking. All right. I'm proud of you. We all are, aren't we? Sticking to your guns. We had a book going on the shop floor. No one thought you'd even take the vote so, yeah, good on you. Well done. Ain't just a vote now. Got a meeting tomorrow, all the bosses. And I'm going. Oh? It's all right, I'll plate your tea up in the morning and then if I'm back late, you can just heat it through. Apparently, you go to a Berni Inn on the way there. That's snazzy. Isn't it? It'll be all right, won't it? Yeah, of course. We don't have to do anything. The men will do all the talking. No, I mean, it's not too posh in there, is it? I'm wearing the right stuff? No, you'll be fine. I'm so glad you're here. After you, ladies. Gentlemen. Thank you. - Here you are, sir. - Lovely. Do you ever worry about your waist? You're joking. That steak. Barnaise sauce. It's Monty. He always insists on coming here. As long as the union's paying. Rita. Yeah. Word of advice. When we get there, don't let them lure you in. If they seem to be asking you a question, keep your head down. I'll handle it. Above all, if I nod, you nod. Got that? Right. That nice, was it? It's lovely, thank you. I couldn't eat another thing. Oh. Mr. Dawson. I'm sorry, we weren't expecting you until... It's quite all right. It's no problem. Oh, and there's four of us. You might need an extra chair. Right. Two teas. On a previous occasion, in a free vote, the girls agreed to the new grading structure. They did not agree, however, as to where they would end up on it. Which is why we're sitting round this table. Look, I understand what the girls are saying. I just don't... I'd rather you didn't speak for the girls, Mr. Hopkins. None of us here knows what's in their heads. The fact remains there's a formal grievance procedure in place and the machinists' case will be heard. What we can't do is let them jump the queue. Peter, look, you know me. I ain't got no ax to grind with Ford. - Am I right or am I right? - You've always been fair. Exactly. Ah, we're all men of the world. Let's cut to the chase, shall we? We'll reconvene in two weeks' time. Monty. Listen. We'll reconvene, we'll come back down here again for the day and then at that point you can guarantee to look into the girls' complaint. The thing is, Monty... That way you can go back to your bosses and say that the strike's off because of how you've handled today's negotiations. We can go back to the girls and say they're now your number-one priority in a few weeks' time. That seems very fair. I'm not so sure the girls'll be too happy. The girls will be fine. As long as they know they're not being fobbed off by the management. The union's setting the terms. That's what's important. Bollocks. What? I'm sorry, Albert, but it is. Three hours we've been sat here. "That's what matters to the girls"? How you qualify to talk about that, I do not know. Here. Have a look at this. There. You put them together. Go on. It's Ford property, I believe. Oh, stop it. We have to take these different pieces and work out how they go together. Because there ain't no template, is there? We have to take them and sew them all freehand into the finished article. The same with the door trim and God knows what else. That is not unskilled work, which is how you've regarded us. Christ, you need to take an exam to get on our line. Please, miss, I... No, it's Mrs. O'Grady. Mrs. O'Grady, I understand your grievance... Well, I really don't think you do. It's not difficult, though. We're entitled to semi-skilled and the wages what go with it. Bring this to the meeting... Hang on. And as regards to this queue-jumping business, well, we put this complaint in months ago, didn't we? It's just you've done nothing about it. And we all know why. That's because women have never been on strike before, isn't it? You just thought you could forget it and we'd all go away. Well, I'm sorry, but it isn't gonna be that easy because we're not going anywhere. We're gonna do what we said we would. No more overtime and an immediate 24-hour stoppage. And where it goes from there, well, it's up to you. If you'll excuse me, I've really got to be going. Thank you very much. Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you. You think I like looking stupid? I didn't know what she was gonna do. You didn't know they were in her handbag, pull them out? Look at his face. Oh, don't worry, you were great. Thank you very much, Albert. Thank you very much. I knew, I knew. It's up here, you see. I wanted clever, Rita, that's why I picked you. Oh, stop it. When you pulled out these cuttings, oh, that was amazing. It was. I never expected that, that you'd come prepared. Oh, no, he was right. I was nicking them. Yeah, Eddie uses them to patch the tent up for when we go camping. All the same. Listen, don't worry about Monty, I'll handle him. Don't worry. Can I have them back? Oh, yeah. Cheers. What are you gonna say to them? You tell them. You what? This is your fault. All right. Hold that. Right. Everybody out. I can't believe it. It's all right. I could do with a cup of tea. I could do with something a lot stronger than that. Now, I realize this is my first day in the job and it may be that I am missing something here, but when we were elected two years ago, it was on a wave of optimism that Labour would utilize its close relationship with the unions to develop manufacturing industry so that it would better serve the employer and the employee. Yes, I think that was in the manifesto. It was. Trust me. So, what have you been doing since 1966? I... Two years this department has had in which to make a difference. Shall we see what has been achieved in the last 12 months? Twenty-six thousand strikes in the United Kingdom, with the resulting loss of 5 million working days. Unions and management barely talking to each other, productivity levels through the floor, and our balance of payments, the wrong side of catastrophic. It's hardly the stuff to set the champagne corks popping, is it? Thank you. See yourselves out. Here you are, babes, you forgot your flask. I love you Dave, cheers. You too, darling. Good luck. You get stuck in, girls. Thank you. Thank you. Monica, that's yours. Cheers, love. Happy with that. It's a holiday. What's this? A mothers' meeting? Hey, cheeky sod. Are you all right? How you getting on? Give us half a chance. Good luck. See you later. Come on, ladies, let's hear you. Bye. See you later. Cheers, Eddie. What have you done to your eyes? It's amazing, isn't it? My friend showed me how. Scouts everywhere. That's how Twiggy got discovered. Up west, you dozy sod, not Dagenham. You never know. We'd better shut this gate. I've spelt it right, haven't I? Close the gate. I know. At least they know we're serious, eh? Not as helpless as they thought. Come on then, girls. No more seats today, Mr. Ford. Come on, girls, let's get together. What if we form a line or something? Line up there. Yeah. Hold the banners up. - We need some in the back. - Standing? - Like that. - Come on, then. That's it. Here we go. Like this? Yeah. They're running low on finished seats. So get these down to the Cortina line, then come back for the Escorts. They're calling. Come on. Anyone fancy a cuppa? Yeah. Tea's up, ladies. Come on. Yeah, put that down a bit. That's gonna hurt your arms. Get me Tooley. Stand by, girls, could be trouble. - Hello, girls. - What's Brenda got? Tea's up. Bananas, apples, pears, the lot. Thanks for the ride, Arthur. He's lovely. Brenda, you never. - Why not? He's gorgeous. - I would. Just as I was leaving with the fruit, he goes: "I believe all the workers of the world should unite." So I thought: "I can help you with that one straight away." So I did. Hey, Peter. Bobby here. What can I do for you? We've got another dispute, I'm afraid. Another one? Who is it this week? It's the women. Quick. Quick, quick. Come along, girls. You're gonna get soaked, love. Oh, no. They're gonna drip, aren't they? - It'll pass. - What are we gonna do now? Pubs ain't even open. Monica. Just wanna have some chips. I suppose we've done a full day, haven't we? - We have, haven't we? - Yeah. I have gotta get down the dogs later. Yeah. I did promise my mum I'd cook her tea. Did you? Yeah. Oh, sod it. We've registered the protest, haven't we? Yeah. Go on. School's out. Yeah! Home time. Onwards and upwards, Rita. - Well done, girls. - See you. Hey, and Rita, well done. It was your gob what got us here, wasn't it? Sandra? I've just been round to your house. I've just been round to your house. Why? I thought you would've gone home ages ago. No. I'm lucky if I can get the lads to hold out for a full hour. Look, I wanted a little chat. You fancy a cup of tea? I can't. I'm sorry, I've got stuff to... I'm buying. Go on, then. Seeing as it's pelting it down, a quick cuppa won't hurt. Over there by the window. Over there. I'm dripping all over the floor. Come on, Albert, spit it out. Yeah. Sorry. It's all right. This dispute's got nothing to do with what skill level you are. Ford decided to give you less money because they can. They're allowed to pay women a lower wage than men. All over the country, Rita, women are getting less because they're women. You'll always come second. You'll always be fighting over the scraps. Until you... We get equal pay, yeah. Yeah. What I don't get is why it's so important to you. I got brought up by my mum. Me and my brothers. She worked all her life and she paid my Aunt Lil to take care of us during the day. And it was hard. Especially as she was getting less than half what the blokes at the factory was getting for doing the same work. And there was never any question that it could be any different. Not for her. Yeah. Someone has gotta stop these exploiting bastards getting away with what they've been doing for years. And you can. You can, Rita, believe me. What about Connie? I mean, she's shop steward. We voted for her. But this needs a leader. Someone to inspire the girls, to make the points clear. And that ain't Connie. Not at the moment. Not with George the way he is. I've already spoke to her. She's more than happy for you to have a go. More than. Look, don't say nothing now. Just sleep on it. Will you? Do you want to wait in here? Ey? Do you want to wait in here? No, you're all right. It's tipping it down. Please. I'm dripping. I know. Get in. I'll get it all over your car. Come in, quick, quick, quick. Thank you. Oh, my God. Gosh, you're soaked. I'm so sorry. It's fine. I'll ruin your car. We met before, actually. Do you remember, in the corridor? Yeah. I've been hoping to run into you for a day or two, actually. Oh, yeah? Um... I was wondering if you'd sign a letter. I'm making a formal complaint to the headmaster about Clarke's use of the cane. What? He seems to think my son... Sorry, I mean... You were there for the same reason I was? Yes. He was indiscreet enough to mention you. Of course. I think he was suggesting we were hysterical and desperately needed to calm down. I had it all straight in my head what I was gonna tell him and what I was gonna say. It's just... Oh, you can't talk to Mr. Clarke. I mean, nobody can. He... You have to listen. He's a bully. Which is why he beats them. Yeah. Yeah. Go on, then. Give us a pen. Thanks. It's stopped. Yeah. That's just my luck, isn't it? Thanks. Look, um, I know you're not mentioning it because you're being polite. It's just... You know, when we met in the corridor, I was really upset, and I never usually use that type of language. Don't you? No. Because I called Mr. Clarke a complete cock. Oh. Oh! Did you? Fair enough. Well, he is. Here they come. Left a bit of a puddle, now. It's all right, David's getting in the back. That dress, I've seen it before, it's lovely. In Vogue. Oh, thanks. It's Biba. Is it? Well... Well, it's still gorgeous. Have a good day, yeah? You too. Be good. And you. Hell, Sandra. I think you've had a bit of shrinkage in the wash. Hot pants. Mary Quants. Give them back to her, they look painful. I think they look lovely. Thanks. It's like what Brenda said, isn't it? This ain't Knightsbridge, it's Dagenham. If you wanna get spotted, you gotta stand out more. And that's exactly what I'm gonna do. - Yesterday were great, weren't it? - Being on strike? Yeah. It's a glimpse, isn't it? Of how it could be. Well, that's what it's about, isn't it? Pitch-bleeding-black. I couldn't see me hand in front of me face. Finally when he turns the lights on, it was actually stuck to me bottom lash. She got fired. Blimey. I'm here, just. Oh, Christ. Connie? Con? Rita, I... No, I just wanna say something. Sorry, I just, um... If I was to get a bit more involved, you know, with Albert, it's only because I've got a gob on me. You're the heartbeat of this place, always have been. Rita, look at me, all at sixes and sevens. You can do this and you should. Here we go. Man! Brian. Hello, Brian. Is that a cotton bob in your pocket or a hard-on? - What's he doing? - Having a fiddle. Here, Con. Pass them out, girls. Yeah, come on, Rita. Go on, Rita. Give them hell. Ignore it. Ignore it? Standard issue, day after a walkout. Have you seen the language? "Your aggressive disregard for the existing complaints procedure." Tone of that? They don't mean it. So why are they saying it? That's how we've always done it. All the other strikes. It's like the rules. Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Sorry, we ain't playing that game. We ain't your men. We're us. And we certainly won't be addressed in this manner. No. All those in favor of not only maintaining but increasing our current action by going to an all-out stoppage until we get the same rates of pay as the men? What? Equal pay? Why not? Because that's what this is really about, isn't it? We're on the lowest rate in the whole factory despite the fact we've got considerable skill. And there's only one possible reason for that. It's because we're women. Yeah. And in the workplace, women get paid less no matter what skill they got. Which is why, from now on, we gotta demand a level playing field and rates of pay which reflect the job, not whether you've got a dick or not. This strike is about one thing and one thing only: fairness. - Yeah. - That's right. Equal pay or nothing. Yes. All those in favor? Yes. Everybody out. Well, it's got nothing to do with me. An all-out stoppage? Also, the specifics of this strike, they've widened out a bit. Christ. Shit. Fucking Ada. Equal pay? What were you thinking, Monty? It wasn't me, it was Albert. He went behind me back. Really, Monty? He's a loose cannon. You wanna haul someone over the coals, he's your man. The bloody troublemaker. Get him in. I tried to protect you, Albert. But you're gonna get such a fucking bollocking. Come on, then. This is awkward, Albert. You know that, don't you? It jeopardizes a whole raft of other negotiations that the unions are already at loggerheads with management over. Look, comrade, basically, you encouraging these women to get all militant... It shifts resources away from the blokes, who are the ones at the coalface. We ain't unsympathetic, but as a union, we have to remember who comes first. The Communist Party and Marx himself said: "Men write their own history." That's "men," Albert. But didn't he also say, "Progress can be measured by the social position of the female sex"? Or was that a different Marx? That was Groucho, was it? Equal pay across the board. You telling me that ain't worth fighting for? Of course it is. And you know it. I'll tell you something. This Rita has got a bigger set of balls than you three put together. And she ain't scared to lay them on the line neither. And I, for one, am gonna help her. And if you are what you say you are, an organization pledged to support its members, then you'll get off your lazy, fat arses and you'll help her too. Good fucking evening. They can't expect us to carry on being graded unskilled. Unskilled, my arse. We're here to put across our point of view about what's going on. It ain't fair. And also about how it's a part of something bigger, much bigger. What about a little bit of support this way? Come on, mate. You might learn something if you just listened. The time has come for all women to say "enough." We do not and we will not accept this any longer. Ow! Dad, the pan. Bollocks! No, Daddy didn't mean that. Thank you. Thank you very much. That was magnificent. That was wonderful. Be back in a minute. You're doing the same work for Ford here in Liverpool that we're doing for them down in Dagenham. So you know that our job is skilled. She's a bit of all right. Think beyond that. I'm asking you to strike now for all women, not just machinists. Leave him alone. He's gotta concentrate. Go, get back. Have a word with him. And what is right is that every single one of us is entitled to the same pay as men. Yeah! That's my girl. Will all those in favor please put your hands in the air now? Yeah! Yeah. Well... How'd you get on? We slaughtered them. Every single one of them came out. It was incredible though, Eddie. Well done. Go and check on the kids. Give them a quick kiss good night. Gonna take some money, all right? Oh, no. What happened? Dad. Tell him to give it another go, yeah? I'm off. See you later. You're all right taking them to school, aren't you? Of course. You're all right with that? Everything's all right, isn't it? Yeah, why wouldn't it be? No reason. Have a good day. See you later. This is my last one. Ey? The shirt, I just noticed. Oh, yeah. Sorry, I forgot. Forgot washing Monday. I'll do it tonight. Right. - Take care of your dad. - Bye, Mum. Have a good day. Oh, dear. Come on. Come on, girls. Equal pay. Equal pay. Equal pay. Which way? Wait a minute. No, Ri, it's here. It's down this way. It must be up here. Anyone got a map? There. - There it is. - Oh, my God. - Oh, here we are. - Here we go. We want respect. We want respect. We want respect. We want respect. Get the banner up. Look, get that. There. Equal pay for women! - I'll support you. - Thank you for your support. Equal pay for women. Women workers for equal pay. - We want respect. - Darling, over here. We want respect! Hey! Hello. I finish at 4. Give us a call, love? I never thought we'd get this backing. Show us what you got. Hold on, girls! We're not entirely unfurled, look. Don't we all? I know the feeling. Don't look, boys. In their campaign for equal pay, women workers of Ford Dagenham brought their protest to Westminster today. Some didn't need much persuasion to demonstrate their feminine charms. It's interesting, all this politics, when you get down to it. Oh, sorry. How long will they stay out? Must be starting to bite. As long as it takes. Does your husband support you? He has to. Yeah. Yes, of course he does. And we all supported the men when they went out on strike. Yeah. Does it bother you that you've been described as the Revlon revolutionary? Have they been in touch about doing some modeling? I don't think so. I think you're talking to the wrong girl. Actually... No, I prefer to focus on the issues of the strike. What makes this strike different is it's not about a specific pay... Ain't that something, eh? Yeah, she's doing all right. This is Laurie Cannon, BBC News, at Westmin... She mentioned you on the telly there, Ed. I tell you what, that's some woman you got there. Right. I gotta get going. What, already? Gotta fetch the kids. Rita reckons they ain't gonna be back till 6, so I need to get them sorted. Get your apron. Shut up, you. Tell her to get her finger out. It's gone on long enough. I don't think they're dragging it out. It's all right for you, it's different for me. I can't be doing with this strike. Yeah, I know that, and they'll settle it. Soon as they can. See you tomorrow. Yeah. See you later, Ed. Top it up, would you, Pete, please? There's nothing I can do about it. Come and have a look for yourself. That's what I'm saying, you've had them all. There are no more finished seats. Full stop. Frank, what do you want me to do? We're going home, mate. You what? No more seats, no more jobs. For any of us. You lot are a bit early, aren't you? Hey, what's going on? You've shut the factory. Well done. Ford's Dagenham. The plant is mainly idle. With thousands laid off, strike bound, and production barely ticking over, millions of vital pounds being lost in export orders. And until there's an answer to the rift between management and Ford's machinists, the factory gates will remain closed indefinitely to the entire work force. You all right? Yeah. Been busy, have you? Yeah. It's the final push, Eddie. Entire main plant closed down. Ford can't afford that, so... I mean, I'm sorry about you and the lads and everything. Oh, no, don't worry about us, Rita. We was only saying on the way out it's warm weather at the moment. Cut the gas off, we'll hardly notice. Yeah. Well, the thing is, Eddie, you know, I know how you feel. All them times you've been on strike and us girls come out in support of you men. It's meant no work for us either. Yeah. Have you got something on your mind, Eddie? Ey? Got something on your mind? Got nothing on my mind. I'm fine. I'd say. Good. It ain't been the easiest day for me either. Thank you for waiting. I have Mr. Ford for you gentlemen. I thought your boy said he could handle this. Do we even know what we're dealing with? Socialist Workers Party? Workers Revolutionary Party? Revolutionary Communist-fucking-Party? Who's she with? Well, we don't actually think she's with anyone, sir. We actually don't think she's a communist. She looks... I don't care if she looks like Jane-fucking-Fonda. I wanna know why she's acting like this. As a matter of fact, she hasn't got a political background either inside or outside the union. Her husband is a moderate. We just think she's got a beef. A beef? Heh. Have you tried getting a decent steak in England? If this woman gets what she wants, we'll end up having to do it right across the world. Do you understand that? Yes, sir, I do. Good. So deal with it. Guess you'll be getting the next flight. Yeah. Prime Minister, I don't think you appreciate the urgency... The urgency of the situation. Fetch. Good dog, Barry. - That's it. - Prime Minister? Until you help me, I cannot get this country back to work. I understand that, but we need to tread carefully. Draw the unions in. We have to acknowledge that without the unions, there would be no Labour Party. Hm. I was a member of the trade union movement while you were still at your mother's breast. Unless you've got something to add beyond the obvious, I'd prefer it if you keep quiet. Harold, you asked me to do this job. You appointed me. You're the best man in my cabinet, I often say that. Harold, I cannot do it without you. I need you. Jack Scamp, he's your man. Any impasse, get Jack in. Sits them all around a table, beer and pork pie. Straight-talking negotiation. He's the way forward. Beer and pork pie? Mm-hm. Might not do for the latest one down at Ford. A hundred and eighty-seven machinists, all women. Well, perhaps we can get them a finger buffet in, eh? Finger buffet? Good. - So how was the flight? - It was long. I'm sorry to drag you over. Well, they're taking this very seriously, right at the top. Come in, my wife's cooking dinner. Well, I don't wanna be any trouble. Honestly, it's the least I can do. Lisa, this is Robert Tooley. Pleasure to meet you. Likewise. At last. I was telling Peter that I'm perfectly happy to eat later at the hotel so... It's really no problem. She loves to cook, don't you? Let me take your hat and coat. Thank you. Come through, have a drink. I'll run you back when we're finished. Thank you. It was delicious. Lovely. Thank you. Can you bring some brandy glasses back in with you? Absolutely. Lisa? Do you mind if I call you Lisa? You must have quite a head on your shoulders. Peter tells me that you read history at Cambridge? - Yes, I did. - Do you mind if I ask what do you think of our little problem over at the factory? Do you think maybe he's a bit too much velvet glove? Not enough iron fist? Oh, not at all, no. No, quite the opposite actually. Look at Vauxhall. They don't have any problems with the unions because General Motors has a more collaborative approach to management. Whereas at Ford, you... Well, you only deal with the unions because you have to. You tolerate them. And as a result, they're more entrenched and they're aggressive in their dealings with you. Well, ha-ha, that's a very progressive point of view. Don't you think? Cheese. What? We have some Stilton. Why don't you get that out? Right. Some grapes. - Yes, good idea. - That'll be terrific, thank you. Come on, girls. There's a cauliflower or cabbage for everyone. Cauliflower again? Haven't got anything else? Blimey, he must love you. I've never had real pineapple. - Let her know it's yours. - Go on, Mum. Sandra, here's your strike pay. Thanks. Three quid? Yeah, I know it's not much. It's all the union can afford, I'm afraid. Better than nothing. I'll take it back if you don't want it. No. Oh, all right then. Sandra, cauliflower or cabbage? - I'm fine, thanks. - Come on, take one. No, I'm all right. I've gotta go, actually. So I'll see you all later. See you. See you later. This one's for Connie, you seen her? I haven't. I'll give it to her. Monica? Oh, is that Connie's? I'll take it. No, it ain't all your responsibility. Yeah, I know. I wanna see her anyway. - Is that real pineapple? - You bet. Can I have some? Go on, help yourself. - See you. - See you. - Bye. - Later, Rita. Come on, girls, get stuck in. There you go. My God. - So sweet. - Yeah, it's just like him. Connie? Connie, are you there? Got you a present. It's from Brenda's fella. Makes a change from potatoes, eh? Albert's been in touch. There's a meeting down the union. Sounds important. Thinks we should be there. No, I don't think so. What are you talking about? Connie? George is ill, Rita. You know that. He's touched. The strike's just whipping everything up. I've gotta put him first. Look, Connie, I know it's hard... No, you don't. I'm not his wife anymore. I'm more like his sister or his... But I'm his. That's all he's got left. Connie, I ain't saying you gotta give up on him. You've got a life too, you know. You gotta live it. Or the war's gonna end up destroying two people. George. George. Shh, shh. It's all right, it's all right, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. It doesn't matter. I'll change it, come on. Out you come. What the hell do you care? I know what you're up to. You're gonna put me away! George. Stop it. Stop. Stop. Stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Monty, this is Mr. Tooley, he's from... Good afternoon, Mr. Taylor. Go break the strike, please. As soon as possible. I'm not sure you appreciate whose side I'm on. Oh, yes, I do. I've been going through your file here. File? You seem to be on your side, Mr. Taylor. I beg your pardon? I don't have to listen to this. Yeah, that's it, keep walking and in six months' time, your union won't exist. Industry cannot afford to pay women the same rates as men, gentlemen. That is a fact. If it is forced to, it will collapse, under the weight of the extra wages. Its workers will get laid off. Their union subscriptions will disappear and so will the unions which collect them. That means you, Monty. You would no longer have any reason to visit these gentlemen via the... What is it? Berni Inn, is it? The Queen's Head? The Chequers? Wow, that's a lot of restaurants. Not to mention the all-expenses-paid trips to the party conferences to the union conferences. In Paris, no less. The Gallic rank and file. Good on you, Monty. These women get what they want and you're fucked. I'd start thinking less about what your union can do for you and more about what you can do for your union. Go break the strike. Please. Personnel files, gentlemen. Everyone's got a weakness, you just have to find it. Hello? Yeah, hello, yes. Yeah, it is. It's all right. I got your note. Thank you. Sorry, I was busy when you came round. What? Really? Hello, Gordon. You all right? Yeah, I'm all right. You all right? Yeah, I'm all right. Yeah? Course you are. Well, you don't have to work, do you? Ey? You can afford to have principles. I mean, you ain't the breadwinner. It's nice. It's a bit extra, but you don't have to. I have to fucking work. Pay the electric and the food and the coal, the fucking basics. Only now I can't. Fucking idiot. Do you believe in this women's strike? No, I don't. They shouldn't get the same as lads. You don't believe in equal pay? No, no, no. Not for women. The men are the breadwinners. The women shouldn't strike because a lot of them husbands work here. Now that the lads have been made redundant, they're gonna be nervous. And Monty, Ford has rattled him, I can tell. So be careful what news you share with him, all right? That's our fridge. Bingo. Excuse me. What's going on? We ain't paid the HP. Last of mine went in the electric bill. How are you set? You want me to hold the door open for you? Go on. I'll make life a little bit easier for you. You spent the money. Ey? Spent the last of the emergency, out of the repair kit. I had to pay the milkman. Not that it matters, we ain't got a fridge. Why? What do you mean, why? Could have put him off till next week. He wanted paying. Should've told him we didn't have it. Right. I'm in charge of the money. Ain't much fucking good at it, are you? We might have some left. Welcome to the real world, Rita. This is being on strike. You run out of cash and you end up screaming at each other. What happened to you? Oh, shut up. Don't you tell me "shut up." Eddie... Hi, Rita. All right, Marge? I thought you were back at work. Can you come in now? In a minute. No, no, we're still on strike. Oh, right. Sharon. I was sure I saw your Sandra down the factory. Sandra? Yeah, it was her. Love, in a minute. I'll see you later, all right? All right. I'm sorry, love. Mummy's gotta sort something. But you said... Yeah, I know I did. Eddie? Eddie, can you look after Sharon? I'll be back later, love. It's all right, sweetheart. Yes. I like this. This is beautiful. Hi. Sally, is it? Sandra. Sandra, yes. Okay, chin up for me. Find this light up here. Find the birdie. There we go. That's a little bit sexy. Okay, there we go. Fabulous, you're a natural. Let's go down on the floor, here. I like that. I like that. And I fucking well like that. I don't know about you guys, I've forgotten about the car. That's great. Let's go up here. Let's go nice and high now, guys. Straight into the camera. Sandra. Keep that. Just keep the pose going there, Sandra. I'm sorry, can I just take a minute? Do you wanna get...? I need a minute. Sure. This is something I've always wanted. I know. I mean, I don't even know if I really care about equal pay. I mean, it's still a shitty factory. This is just a brochure, but, you know... It's only trade, but it'll lead on. Get my foot in the door, you know? I just don't wanna let you down. You haven't let us down. You haven't gone back to work, have you? Because that's the deal here, isn't it? They set up this shoot, you go back to work? Only you haven't gone back to work, have you? So... But if they don't use these photos... Sandra. Look at you. You are a model. You're a natural. They couldn't get better. You could, though. There she is. Up against the clock now, my love. Come along. Drape yourself across this vehicle. I shall avert my eyes. How's this look? No? Hi, Mum. Mum, we've gotta go. Yes. Sorry, darling. You're going, are you? You know I am. I said. Rita asked me to go special. You gotta fight for what you believe in. You know that more than anyone. You think I'd do the same again? If another war come round? I know you would. I love you. Go. Minister, the unions are turning. The other unions. Normally, they all band together. Yes, I gather that's called solidarity. They're not being solid. The men want to return to work. So they're telling unions to withdraw support, put pressure on the women. They'll be back within the week. We'll see. You're assuming the girls will do as they're told. It's not my fault. Connie. You said it was important. Thanks. Listen, I'm sorry I'm late. We've got to talk before this meeting. They're ready for you now. This way, ladies. They've hung you out to dry. Lads in the other unions have had enough. So whatever they say to you now, don't believe it. We'll sort it out later, all right? We're absolutely behind you still, Rita. You and the girls. We're not saying otherwise. We've got other representatives from other unions to pledge their support. You haven't got them all though, have you? The important ones. No, but we're very confident we'll prevail. The thing is though, we've got the national conference coming up. The most sensible thing, probably, would be just go to a vote. Which would be the actual final and binding position, I believe, comrade. After which, it'd be out of our hands. That's right, Monty. As I say, we're expecting full support. We gotta get down to Eastbourne and talk to them first. "Actual final and binding position, comrade." Cheeky sod. That Monty is a sly one though, isn't he? I can't wait to see his face when we turn up down there. See you tomorrow. We can deal with him, Con. We can deal with anyone. That's right, comrade. No! No, George! No! Connie! Connie! Connie. George! Connie! Connie, let me in! It's okay. Dear God. May the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be with you always. Amen. Amen. I'm so sorry, Connie. No, you're not. What? You thought he was a millstone. You thought he was keeping me back. Hey, Con, that's enough. I should've been there. I'm all right. It's all right. I know. Hello. Hello. This is a surprise. Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry it's so late. I nearly didn't come at all. It's all right. I... Sorry, yeah. Do you want a cup of tea? To be honest, I'm not feeling chatty today. I'm sorry. No, it's fine, really. I really don't want to keep you. It's just, um... Mr. Clarke's been asked to leave the school. We won. They're getting rid of him. Right. Of course, yeah. Oh, that's great. I just... That's brilliant. Well, I wanted to tell you. Well, cheers. Thanks. Anyway, I'm sorry to bother you. Not at all, thanks. I'm married to Peter Hopkins. Sorry, what? At the factory. I had a feeling that you didn't know. And I didn't know who you were. With the strike. Sorry, I don't understand. I'm sorry, if you've come here to tell me to back off, I wasn't joking. I've had a hell of a day and... Oh, no. Oh, no. Keep going. Please, keep going. Do you know who I am? Who I actually am? No. I'm Lisa Burnett, I'm 31 years old. I have a first-class honors degree from one of the finest universities in the world. And my husband treats me like I'm a fool. And when I was studying for my degree, I was very, very happy. And mostly because of the work. Because I loved reading about all these extraordinary people making history. And... And I just wondered what it felt like. So let me know, will you, when you finish doing it? I don't know. Don't give up. Don't let me down. Rita, wait! Where are you going? Eastbourne. I left you a note. - I thought you changed your mind. - I gotta go. Rita? Look, Rita, just stop. What, Eddie? Just listen to me. Just... We've gotta sort this out. Eddie... No, no, no, we have, right? Just... Look, I know it ain't been good between us lately, which I ain't about to make worse. Eddie... Just listen to me. Look, if I ain't appreciated what you've done recently... Gotta catch a bus. I really am sorry, but you ain't been perfect either. This really ain't the time, Eddie. Yes, it is, because it needs saying. I know you reckon I ain't bothered about the important things. And I drift along and I'm more interested in fiddling with motorbikes or making tents out of seat covers, but, you know, I try my best. You know? I have a go. I like a drink, but I ain't out on the beer every night or screwing other women or... And I've never once raised me hand. Ever. Or the kids. Christ. What? Why you looking like that? Right. You're a saint now, is that what you're telling me, Eddie? You're a bleeding saint? Because you give us an even break? What are you saying? That is as it should be. Jesus, Eddie. What do you think this strike's all been about? Actually you're right. You don't go on the drink. Don't gamble, you join in with the kids, you don't knock us about. Lucky me. For Christ's sake, Eddie, that's as it should be! You try and understand that. Rights, it's not privileges. It's that easy. It really bloody is. Didn't think you were coming. Hey. Very good, gentlemen. Can I call on Monty Taylor, Senior Convener, Ford Dagenham? Thank you, I shall try to be brief. If you would. The great achievements of civilization depended on slow progress. Step by step. Hence, I am here because I feel that my union, in backing these lovely, brave ladies, these Boadiceas in hairnets, on their way to a fight for equal pay, no matter what. But we have to think about the trade union struggle as a whole. Therefore, gentlemen, I ask you to consider these ladies' demands too much, too soon. Monty Taylor, you two-faced, hypocritical toe-rag! You fucking piece of... Hang on. No, you hang on! Sorry, gentlemen. Hey, we'll sort this out between ourselves later, eh? Monty, I've seen more of their mugs on the front pages the past few weeks than you've managed in 20 years. I wouldn't mind hearing from them. Go on. Go on. My best friend lost her husband recently. He was... He was a gunner in the 50 Squadron in the RAF. Got shot down one time on a raid to Essen. And even though he was badly injured, he managed to bail out. I asked him why he joined the RAF and he said: "Well, they got the best women, haven't they?" Which they did. And then he said, "Well, you gotta do something, haven't you?" You had to do something. That was a given. Because it was a matter of principle. You had to stand up, you had to do what was right. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to look at yourself in the mirror. When did that change, eh? When did we, in this country, decide to stop fighting? I don't think we ever did. But you've gotta back us up. You've gotta stand up with us. We are the working classes. The men and the women. We're not separated by sex. But only by those who are willing to accept injustice and those, like our friend George, who are prepared to go into battle for what is right. And equal pay for women is right. Thank you. I never knew you could talk like that. Scorch marks all the way up the curtains where Monty's arse caught fire. Hello. Excuse me. Gin. I need to calm my nerves. They might vote against us. - How long we gotta wait? - They said half an hour. You know what we can do? Stick it on Monty. - Brilliant. - You're a genius. In that case, I'll have a double. Babycham. - Double gin. - Eddie. - Excuse me. - What do you want, Rita? Where's she gone? Most probably needs some air. Can we have Babycham? I've come to say sorry. I mean, I thought about what you said and you were right, I suppose. You are right. And it's amazing what you've done, Rita O'Grady. And I wanna back you. See, I was gonna tell you that. Only then when I come in and you were speaking and I heard you up there, and you was huge. You was... I don't know. Like a force. Then I thought I'm not sure me backing you makes that much difference, to be honest. Where you are now. Anyway, go on, you go back to your meeting. I'm gonna... I should... Eddie? You've said some pretty stupid things in your time. Of course you backing me makes a difference. It makes all the difference in the world. Very good, gentlemen. The results of the vote are as follows: Delegates in favor of support for the women machinists: Seventy-nine. Delegates against: Forty-eight. I declare the motion carried in favor of the Dagenham machinists. Their bloody unions are back in line. It's verbatim. Our man was there. Well, well, well. It really does seem time to call in Sir Jack. Good. I'll do that, then. I'll set up a court of inquiry which he can oversee and let's hope that does the trick. Oh, yes. One more thing. Set up a meeting, will you? Minister? With the machinists. Their leaders. Pardon me? I want to meet them. At the earliest opportunity. But... Yes? The minister doesn't do that... Never has done. It'll just encourage them. Give credence to their cause. I am what is known as a fiery redhead. Now, I hate to make this a matter of appearance and go all womanly on you, but there you have it. And me standing up like this is, in fact, just that redheaded fieriness leaping to the fore. Credence? I will give credence to their cause? My God, their cause already has credence! It is equal pay. Equal pay is common justice and if you two weren't such a pair of egotistical, chauvinistic, bigoted dunderheads, you would realize that. Oh, my office is run by incompetents. And I am sick of being patronized, spoken down to and generally treated as if I was the May queen. Set up the meeting! Morning, Ed. All right, Albert? Yeah. Now, listen. Listen to me. Now, there's no reason to panic, Rita. Okay. Only, I've had a call from Barbara Castle's office. Oh, my God. Eddie. What's happened now? Barbara Castle wants to talk to me. Well done. Cheers. The secretary of state is seeing the women? On whose authority? On her own, apparently. I gather Mrs. Castle is quite a forceful woman. Is she? What are you doing? I represent Ford. We are the biggest car manufacturer in the world. We pump millions of pounds into the U.K. economy. I think it's time my bosses reminded one or two people of that fact. Have you or have you not invited the Ford women to your offices? Prime Minister... I've just spent the last half-hour on the phone to Ford, reassuring him that my government isn't on the side of the strikers. It isn't taking sides. We have to grasp the nettle. Now is not the time. Ten years ago, you were adamant. I wasn't running the country then. See the women if that's what you want to do. But whatever you do, do not upset Ford. I've got enough trouble with the Americans as it is. It's all right. It's your missus I'm after. Is she in? Rita? What are you doing here? Rita? I need a favor. Come in. Thanks. Lisa? What? Come inside. Everything all right? Want a cup of tea? Yeah. Rita. Smile, please. Over here, ladies. Excuse me, gotta get through. Do you think the strike will go on? How long? Rita. Wait a minute. Hey, Connie. Sorry I'm late. You made it. What if Mrs. Castle says "no deal"? How will you cope? Cope? How will we cope? We're women. Now, don't ask such stupid questions. Ladies, ladies. Come up. This way, please. Come on, this is it. All right. See you later. Stay back, please, gentlemen. Follow me. Mr. Tooley. Madam Secretary. I wasn't expecting you. But you are meeting with the women. I think it is time I heard their argument, yes. But if you would care to wait, I will inform you of any decisions we make. I think we both want the same thing, Mrs. Castle, you and I. I think we wanna see Ford Motors employing British workers. Ford is a vital part of our economy. I am well aware of that. Then don't make us build our cars elsewhere. Help us hold the line here. Support our efforts to combat these constant strikes which undermine our ability to build cars at a profit, which is why we're in business in the first place. Otherwise, we will take our factories elsewhere. Are you threatening me, Mr. Tooley? I'm trying to stop 40,000 people from losing their jobs, Mrs. Castle. That's how many workers Ford employs. Not to mention tens of thousands of peripheral jobs sacrificed. Now, I don't think that either one of us wants to take that risk, surely. Look, look. Eileen and Monica. I wonder if they can see us. Get me the prime minister. Yes. Put me through to Number 10. Yes. Yes. Fine. Thank you. I'm afraid he's on a plane. Won't land until this evening. Thanks for coming. Connie, I'm so sorry. No, don't. It's me who needs to apologize. Don't be silly. The minister will see you now. Here we go. You all right? Ready? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Mrs. O'Grady, I recognize you from the news. Rita, please. Rita. Very pleased to meet you. Well, and me, you. Sorry. This is Connie. Connie. - How do you do? - Brenda. How do you do? Sandra. Well, I'm delighted you could all come. Please, take a seat. Would you care for a sherry? Be lovely, thank you. Thank you. You haven't got any whiskey, have you? Here's a woman after my own heart. Make that two. Thank you. Well, cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Now, I've been following your dispute very closely and I want to say how proud I am of the battle that you fought. I fully support the struggle for equal pay and you will have it. But in time. What? Industry'll object, the lords will kick up a fuss, the press will have a field day. It's not going to be easy. Well, what is what's worth fighting for? Return to work. Go back to your machines and you have my word I will push forward with your fight. No. Mrs. O'Grady... No, we need something solid. Something now. You've got the authority. You know, we thought seeing you, we'd... In politics, you sometimes have to play the long game... We ain't politicians, we're working women. And so are you. Very well. What would it take to get you back? Excuse me? The "something solid." And mark well, I say something, not everything. Well, we'd need... We'd need a guarantee that we're gonna get equal pay. And in the meantime, we need to move much closer to the male rate. Now. At Ford. Seventy-five percent? Ninety. Ninety. At least. You're putting me in a very difficult position. I wasn't too aggressive, was I? No. Mr. Tooley, that risk you were talking about? I'm going to have to take it. And from Whitehall we're getting news that talks between Mrs. Castle and the striking Ford machinists are nearing a conclusion. And a statement is expected in the next few minutes. Intense interest here... Just a moment please, minister. Yes, of course. That's Biba, isn't it? I saw that in a magazine. Yeah. I have to give it back at the end of the day. Is that C&A? Yes. Why pay more? That's what I say. Well, exactly. I've got the same one at home. Have you really? They're ready for you now, minister. Girls? Rita? Rita? Ladies. No, after you. Oh, no, no. After you. Oh, gosh. Come on, then. Thank you. Rita, is it a positive result? Now, ladies, can I help? Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you very much. I am delighted to announce that following our talks this afternoon, the 187 Ford machinists will be going back to work on the first of July. They will receive an immediate pay rise of 7 pence an hour. Which will put them at 92 percent of the male rate. However... However, this is not all. As a result of our discussion, I can confirm that the government is in full support of the creation of an Equal Pay Act. And by the autumn of this year, I guarantee appropriate legislation to ensure that that act becomes law. Thank you. Yeah! More support from the back there. To celebrate, they let us have the canteen, and we had a party. I don't remember much of that. No, I remember you didn't, no. And I thought to myself, there is some of the old spirit that gave us the success of the suffragettes. - We are on strike. - All of you? All of us. All us machinists, anyway. So no car seat covers for Fords? No, not from us, anyway. You're still staying out? Yeah. You're not going back at all? No. Nobody expected us to come out on strike. Nobody. What we're fighting for, we'll stay there until we get it. Women don't make a habit of coming out on strike for nothing. Well, we didn't think we were that strong. We didn't think we would bring Fords to a standstill. It was all down to us. Us ladies. And we are ladies, whatever anybody else may say. We are ladies. Everybody out!
