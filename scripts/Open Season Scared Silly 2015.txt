I'll be scary! With lots of claws And so hairy These stubby legs will grow into Four muscle-y weapons of ferociousness My puppy dog eyes will burn blood red My snout will grow into a toothy snarl This silky coat Will all fall out And in its place a wolf-y mane I feel a change and now Yes, at last! I am the werewolf! Lupus homine Which in Latin means "werewolf" Yes, at last Mr. Weenie is no more!
