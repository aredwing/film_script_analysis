Charles. After you get through this. Take the night off. Get some sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Thank you. Doctor. Not another one. Tim. You can't keep leaving DVDs in the locker like this all day. Man. It's hot as fuck out here. Dude. They'll melt. Tim! Yeah. Yeah. I hear ya. Hey. Simone. Busted. Yeah. Laugh it up. Bitch. Yeah! - What a dweeb. - So gross. They had better not go to this party tonight. Their best friend is dating Jackie. So I'm sure they'll be there. God. Do not remind me. Oh! Jesus Christ! I'm sorry. Did I hurt you ladies? What's your problem. Lance? My problem is you know you're not supposed to be talking to my girl. We'll talk to whoever we goddamn please. They'll talk to whoever they please. Guys. That's what they're gonna do. Just watch it. Let's go. God. I'd like to fuck up that kid's day. I'd like to drive a chainsaw right through his face. Where the hell's Chris? No. Wait. Wait. Jackie. We have to talk about this party tonight. You're trying to get off going. Aren't you? It's just that it's not my thing. Plus. Your friends hate me. Whatever. I know it's not your thing. What are you doing for the rest of the day? Well. There's an early show at the Backward tonight. - The nasty bar downtown? - It's not nasty. Grungy maybe. But it's not nasty. - Whatever. Who's playing? - Dance Floor Tragedy. What? What now? - They suck. - They do not. They do suck. - Hooker. Let's go back to class. - Did you just call me "hooker"? Good afternoon. Good to see everybody back from the weekend. Let's take out our homework. If you would. While we're turning to page As we continue our study under the problem solving we've been looking at. It's important to see... ...as we note in our problem solving... - Yo. Matty. - You guys have to check this out. Everybody move! Get out of the way! Asshole. You guys wanna hit this show tonight or what? - Uh. I will if you drive. - I don't have the money for gas. - I'll swing by and pick you fools up. - What time? Five. We should leave early so we don't have fucking traffic. - I'll be over at Scott's house. - Hey. That shit's fucking gross. Man. Oh. Yeah. Come on. Man. Let's go. What's your fucking deal? That's so disgusting. You're totally ruining your reputation right now. I gotta go. Have fun tonight. Bye. You're such a bitch. Bye. God. I hate that fucking kid. Mom? Mom. You up there? Mom? Jesus... Christ. Mom. What the fuck? Mom? Holy shit! Mom! No. Mom. It's me! Stop! Help! Stop this! Mom! Help me. God! Oh. God! Mom. No! Why is it again that we're driving all the way out to this stupid party? This is where everything was going down. Everybody's gonna be here. Come on. Baby. It's gonna be the social event of the year. Plus. We got states coming up. I gotta get my drink on. - This sucks. - I know. He's such a player. I gotta pee. Where is this place? Dad? - What are you doing home so early? - Jesus. They let us out early. Yeah? What's the deal with the old man leaving his mower on? He probably fell asleep on the toilet again. We're gonna head downtown. Check out this band for a couple of hours. - Is it cool if I take the car? - Yeah. Just be home by midnight. More dead bodies to drain? Get outta here. - All right. Later. - Bye. Forget something? Seriously. Man. What the hell do you think happened with Brad? I don't know. The kid has always been fucking weird. It doesn't surprise me that he went psycho on Latt. Yeah. But you heard Professor Latt. He said Brad bit him. Maybe he was... hungry. Don't spread crackers in my bed. Man. Come on. Whoo! At least there's a bunch of people here already. Did you guys expect anything less from this town? I mean. A bunch of drunks. And you. What's up with you dating this grungy-ass stoner? He's not a stoner. OK? - We haven't been down here in weeks. - Because this asshole has to have a job. I work at the video store where y'all get your free videos. DVDs. Assholes. That's way better than working for my dad. I have to drain dead corpses all day. Give me this. Here comes my man. - Hey. Babe. - Ladies. Ladies. How are you? Good. - Been waiting for this beer. - Let's go celebrate. - All right. - Excuse me. Ladies. See you girls later. Are we there? How long we been driving? Scott. Hey. How long we been driving? - About 45 minutes. - Why? Something's not right. What are you talking about. Man? I've been driving for 45 minutes and I haven't seen a car in either direction. - So? - So look at the time. It's rush hour. What the fuck is going on. Man? I don't know. Let's just get to the bar. You're just what I thought. Lady. Are you serious? - How you doing? - I'm fine. No. Wait. Where are you? - Your breath too? - Yeah. I think I got... What do you think? I think it's a bad idea. Man. There's gotta be people in there. The city just doesn't shut down. Fuck it. What the hell is that noise? Scott! Oh. Shit! What the fuck was that? What the fuck was that? Calm down! Just fucking calm down. Calm down. - Did you see what was out there? - I fucking saw what was out there! - Who the fuck are you? - Whoa. Whoa! I said who the fuck are you? We're nobody. Look. We just came from Downey. We're just here to see the show. Can you tell us what the hell is going on? I don't know. It all happened so fast. The band started playing. And then... then it happened. What happened? They were eaten alive. Ripped apart like they were nothing. Who... Who got eaten? Everyone. Are you telling me that those people out there are fucking zombies? I'm saying that whatever they are. They ain't human. Why we always gotta match? - I don't know. I'm sorry. - Damn cell phones. What? Is your boyfriend not answering? - No. It hasn't been working all day. - Right. If he even went to that show. You always drink too much. It's so funny. You can't get a hold of your boyfriend. I said the phone wasn't working. - That's what they all say. Honey. - Whatever. Fuck off. What are we gonna do? I don't know. So where did they go? To get their next meal. Great. Meanwhile. We sit here and wait for them to come back? Do you ever just shut up? It's all right. He's locked up. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well. When I have it in two months. Oh. Hey. Matty. How you doin'? Are you OK? Are you all right? Oh. My God! My baby! I think you've had enough to eat for one day. You gotta shoot 'em in the head. We have to make it back to the car. - It's our only chance of making it out. - We never should have gotten out of it. - I'm not going back out there. - Fine. You can sit here and be dinner. But not me. If it hasn't already reached Downey. It will soon. And I can't sit here and let everyone I know become food for these bastards. I knew this was a bad idea. What the fuck? Get the hell out of here. You dick. Look. Asshole. She said get the fuck... Oh. My God. What the? - Let's go. - Unlock the door. Unlock the door! Unlock the door. Unlock the door. The door! The door! Chris. Let's go! Let's go. Chris! Chris! Let's go. Chris. Get in the car! Chris. Let's go! Chris! Chris! Chris! Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Get in. Get in. Get in. Chris! Let's go. Go. Go! We have to get back to Downey. This is suicide. You know. I know. Chris. Let's just keep goin'. I can't. I have to. No! No! Shit. Argh! Hey. Jackie! Go. Go. Go. Chris! Get over here! Hold the door. Hold the door. Hold the door. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go! Get out! Let's go. Go. Go. Go! This is fucking bullshit! Ah. Shit! God! Do you want to get out or stay in this fucking garage? Scott's right. This place is a death trap. They can smell we're here. How far is the school? Are you serious? School is definitely crawling with those bastards! The school has a chance of having survivors. Now. How far is the school? It's less than a mile. How the hell do we get past them all? There's hundreds out there! I have an idea. Lance would be so proud. This is insane. So you're gonna stand here and watch them break in through the door anyway? We have to make it to the school. - We can head out there and wait for help. - If help even exists. Jackie. Jackie! Jackie. Get to the school! Back up. Go! Come on. Get in the car! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Are you OK? - No. What the fuck was that? No! No! Oh! Tim! Tim... Oh. My God. What? No. Oh! Come on. Come on. Come on. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. How much farther is the school? It's just past those trees. They're gonna catch us. No. They're not. They're not. What... What if it's the same there as everywhere else? People know to go there in emergencies. Maybe they're still alive. Yeah. But what if they're not? If we wait... someone will come looking for us. Jackie! Hey. Jackie! Jackie. Come here. Come here. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Damn. That's hard-core. Tim. Tim! It's OK. Look. I'm not one of them. What's going on? What's happening to everyone? Look. We shouldn't be here. Why? Why? They can smell us. What are you doing?! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! I'm not leaving you. But we cannot stay here. Let's go. Listen to me. Listen to me. If we stay here. I cannot help you. But I know someplace that we can go. Listen to me. I know what these things are. I can help you. Understand? Please... just... leave! I got ya. Jesus. look at this. Oh. My God. Shh. Shh. Shh. Don't they ever quit? They will when we're dead. Argh! Upstairs. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Get up the stairs. Get up the stairs! No. No! Come on. Come on. Dinner's over. Oh. Shit! No! No! Ahh! You son of a bitch! Scott. Scott. Hold on. Hold on. - Shit. Give me your hand. - Get me up! Get me up! Come on! Look out! Where's Tim? Huh? Where's Tim?! Where's fucking Tim?! Where's Tim? Where's fucking Tim? Where's fucking Tim? Get the fuck off me! - She saved your life. You fucking asshole. - What about Tim. Huh? What about Tim? You were right. We can't stay here. - No! - We can't stay here. Don't you get it? No! - We're gonna get out. - We're not. - We're gonna get out. I promise. - I wasn't right. Tim was right the whole time! We're fucked! No one is coming for us. Everyone is fucking dead! - We're all gonna be all right. - No. We're not! I'm tired of running. Where... Where are you going? - Don't do this. - I have to. Scott... Don't... It's time to go. It's time to go. All right. You fucks. Come and get it! We have to go. There's no one left. Chris. Everybody's dead. Someone's alive and we're gonna find 'em. Are you serious? - I'm not going anywhere. - We have to. - Please don't make me go anywhere. - We have to! - Get up. Get up. Get up! - What was that? Oh! Simone! Aaargh! Let's go. Come on. - Wait. Aren't you Lee. The janitor? - Sit down. Kid. How long you been down here? Since it started. Since what started? The war. We're not in any war. No. Not the commercialized bullshit war you're thinking of. Hmph. This is different and we're definitely in the shit. What the hell are you talking about? Those things out there aren't any fucking accident. This town and Grover City aren't on any maps. Out here. We're all just guinea pigs. Guinea pigs? Wars? You're not making any sense. And how the fuck are you such an expert? But you've been our janitor since... since I started at this school. I was stationed here like a hundred others. Including your father. My dad? He's a mortician. Yeah. And I'm just a janitor. So you're saying that the government put you here to prepare for some war? In the early 1970s. When everyone was concerned about what we were doing in Vietnam. The government and the army started doing tests to reanimate corpses. You mean zombies. In the movies. Zombies can't think. They can't run. They can only feed. In real life. The army made them lethal - able to think. Able to run. The only thing left that remained was their lust for human flesh. After a few years. The experiments were shut down. Everything was deemed classified. Until recently. Over the last ten years. The army says they made leaps and bounds with technology. So the government reopened the experiments and Grover City became their main facility. What about my dad? What does he have to do with all this? Your dad led the experiments here in Downey. You said it was an accident but... why would the army just let 'em all loose? They had to see if they were controllable. They found out quickly that they weren't. Why are you telling us this? Aren't you as responsible? Yes. And I will pay for my sins. So what now? How do we stop 'em? You can't stop them. But you can stop it from happening to you. How? Well. His dad invented a serum that rejects the virus should you ever be bitten. - Where is it? - The morgue. The radio signals have been jumbled. That's all I could make of 'em. Everybody stay still. Jon. This is Chris Swartz. Chris. Your father is a good man. Was. He was a good man. I'm sorry. Jon here worked with your father for two years on this experiment. Did you not think that what you were doing was wrong? We were looking at it in terms of saving lives. And how is reanimating dead corpses that feed on human beings saving lives? Who the hell are you to question me? I'm sorry. Chris. Your father was my friend. But think about never having to send our own boys into battle ever again. We could use the dead to fight for us. Never having to tell another American mother their son was killed in battle. - We never thought it would get this far. - It wouldn't have if the army stayed out. But they were never satisfied. They forced Jon and your father to give them a sample before it was even ready for human trials. We need to get to the morgue. That's impossible. All the roads leading to the morgue are infested with the dead. We don't even know if anyone is alive there. Can't you get someone here with your radio signals to help us or something? Doesn't work that way. In the event the experiment failed. This city and nearby cities would be quarantined. Nobody enters. Nobody leaves. This is bullshit. That serum is our only chance! Chris. I'm sorry about your father. But to risk your life to get that serum isn't realistic! Realistic? Nothing I've heard in the past ten fucking minutes has been realistic! We've come too far now. We're not gonna stop. I'm not gonna rot down here. You got balls. Kid. If you think you can make it. Take my key. Here. Oh! Oh. My God. - Come on. Come on! - They're still behind us. Come on. Come on. This way. Come on. Come on. This way. Look around. look around. Where is it. Chris? What the hell are we even looking for?! Anything that can save us. Come on. Who are you? What are you doing here? Jackie. Get back! Come on. Let's get out. Let's get out. Oh. Shit. They're infected. Get 'em now. Come on. Come on. Come on. Move. Move! Go. Go. Go. Go. Wrong turn. Come on. Come on. Inside. Inside. It's locked! Open up. Open the damn door! Let us in! Come on. Open the damn door! Oh. My God. What are we gonna do? Hold on.
