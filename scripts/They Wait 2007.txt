This time of the year, when the dead walk in the world of living, they who can see them, they have to be most careful. - why can't everyone see them? - Most people just feel the fear, but to see them it take a special kind, A very sensitive soul.

You know the rule, you have to at least try it once. - She wants to know if you like duck. - He loves duck. You don't speak Chinese? He speaks a few words. All time time in Shanghai, and he does not speak Chinese. He goes to the international academy, it is a excellent school, and we wanted him to have good language skill when were we return back home.

All these years in Shanghai, and he still cannot speak Chinese. She kind got a point. You said that we would be in China for a year, two at most. We agree that the English school made sense. You did not want him coming back with a lousy language skill. Did you remember? Sarah What's the God damn point, you do noteven care if we come back. Hey, easy. Baby, I'm sorry. I know that it has been tough, the Shanghai's office is almost ready. And we;ll come home soon, I promise. Do you trust me? Why do they callUncle Raymond the bones'collector? Back in the days, he was task to take the bones of Chinese for re-bury. Why? Another old superstition. They believe that unless you bones are buried near the ancestors, your spirit will rest. Is it just the bones? Yes. After seven years he dig them up, clean them, doing the whole ceremony together with the Uncle Xiang. Why you never tell me any of this? It happened before I was born. They were never talking much about that. something a history. - we all have our skeletons. - Yes, but yours are just real. Good one. Get the light. It's ok. I am here. - What's happening, mother? - I think that you are safe, rock and safe. Comeo on, up to bed. - I can't go, mother. - Why not, sweety? - I have to work, lot of work to do. - I think that you are still sleeping, sweet heart. - Just close you eyes. - I cannot, lot of work to do, Or else... - How is Sam? - Sleeping, poor thing. I can't believe neither of you woke up, he was sreaming his lungs out. I'm sorry, I took my sleeping pills. I don;t care what the contract say, we are responsible for the whole amount. I know that it is easier in person, but I am on a funeral, for christ sake. I'll call you back. - They can't manage a week without you? - apparently, not. - You can go, I am ok. - No Aunt, it too soon. - We are not going anywhere. - Business come first. Raymond always said that. No, I need to see the sun, I'll be right back. We are screwed, timing could be worse. - Just go, we'll stay and help her out. - I can't leave you alone with Sam sick. He is not sick, He was sleep walking. - He never sleep walk before. - He never had jet lag before, or see a dead person. he got lots in his mind. - Are you sure? - We'll be fine. You are the best. I am going to pack, Yeah. - Sorry, I did not see you there. - Still sleeping? I think that he is running with a fever. Is there trick to openning the window? It got stuck and it getting a bit stuffy. - I will do it . - No, it is not necessary. Why don;t you go and lie down? You were out all night. I watch over him. Maybe, I'll go and take a shower. Thank you. Get away from me, witch! You do speak Chinese! - You lie to me. - I am not a liar , you are ! What kind of boy's fool an old lady? What kind of old lady fool yourself? Mummy, I don't feel so good . Oh, my god! What happened to your arms? May,May,May, call 911. And his arms ... I do not know, he was down in the basement. There used to be a factory, it might have got something bite. - He was the fine, he was sleepwalking. - can i get some space, please? How is he? - He's still not responsing. - Why?

You said, You said if it got too much that I could come here. - Where did it get this? - I found it in front of my son. - He was the sleep walking. - It is a grave box. a what? The bones of the deceasede were shipped back toe China in this. -One person to a box. - Is this made from lead? Or something toxic? Here, her name was Chen Lu from Kuandung province. She was 17 years old when she died. The girl. Did you already seen her? I have been having these... walking nightmares. Those of us who we see when we dream, are more awake than ever. Leave me shows something. I record my dreams. I try to learn what world beyond this world is telling me. Here, when I first saw your boy, I recognized him. I had that dream to a year ago - What had you done to my son? - I am not your enemy. What had you done to him? from what you described to me I fear that the spirits have it. His soul. I'm sorry. I can'tt believe that I did this. You are confused, frightened. A mother desperate for her child. It is natural. Even that I'm going to believe in this, what am I supposed to do? Find out what the spirits want of you. This girl,Chen Lu, if this is the her box, where are her bones? It was said that if the bones were not buried near to the ancestors the spirit cannot rest. - Then do I have to find her bones? - Perhaps. Ask the Raymond's housewife. In old days, many young girls came to work for your factory. ok You should hurry. The soul of a child is very fragile. Thank you. - I'm so sorry about your boy. - Thank you. This is Ben Lee, an old associate. Sit down, please. What is that? This may sound strange, but but is there a girl who worked here in the old factiry called Chen Lu? I can't remember, we had so many girls working for us. - It was 40 or 50 years ago. - Were her bones left behind? What? Uncle Raymond, the Benevolence society, they were shipping the bones of back to China, were any bones left behind? The Chinese Benevolence society it stopped the shipping of bones many years ago. The communists took it power and they closed the borders, even for the deceased ones. - Many people bones were left behind. - What happened to them? They stayed buried. We stop exhuming the bodies. Thank you. What do the doctors say about Sam? It still no change. Would there any file kept on record of the workers? I remember see some filing cabinets downstairs. - We filled them up years ago. - Do you mind if I go and poke around? - No! - No! Why is there a new padlock in the door of the factory? Because of what happened to Sam. I am worry there is still dangerous chemicals down there. What does the truck do outside? If you don't wany anybody there - what are they unloading? - They work for me. Mrs Tsai is allowing me to put supplies in the warehouse. I sorry, ladies, we have to go. What are you hiding from me? I understand the stress you must be under. For your son sake you should get some rest. Why are you insulting my guests? What's wrong with you Can I please go down and check the records? There are no records! Who keeps the records for over 50 years? I got your message. In coma? I should never left. I love you, hanging there, ok. I'm getting a plane now and we see each other soon. lets me guess, you changed your mind and you want to return to the work. I can use your strength. - I need your help. - I'm your man. Where I can get the records of immigrants who worked in the factory back in the 40s? Are you working on a story? I just need the information. Please. Ok, I am going to try. Which the name of the company? Jason's unlce used to own a garment factory in Chinatown, Tsai Fabrics or something so. a garment factory? - I don't think that they kept reocords of that. - what do you means? It had to have payrolls, immigration's papers or something so? Sarah thinks about that, a chinese garment factory in the 40's or 50's, bringing girls from China, Definitely not going to have any records. - You mean, sweatshop? - I do not want to malign your relatives, but hold on, they had a shipping company to... - Tsai factory, right? - Yes. Swore to god that I am going blind. Here we go, you complain to the labour board, but the workers did not testify. That was in 1949. There was another investigation in the 70's. Allegations of smuggling. Insufficient evidences. All charges were dropped. - Were there drugs? - Parts of animals. - Parts of animals? - Yes, in this zone it must be bears. I did a piece of that a few years ago. Bear's parts are huge delicies in the Chinese. - They make into soup. - That is disgusting. It used to be worse, they use the bear's bile in the traditional medicine. They stick a catheter in the gall bladder of the bear and withdraws bile. The bear suffers very much. That is awlful, whu did Jason's uncle be involved in anything like that? It is illegal and it worth a fortune if you can get it back to China. Yes, she is Sam's mother. Oh my God, I'll be right there. - What happened? - We had to get him to surgery. - His heart is failing. - What? Dr. Kent is with him. we are going to get him through this. Let me get you some water. Mrs Tsai, Are you okay? You really should sit down. - Yo need to take care of yourself. - I am fine. I am going to check on his progress. This is not real, this is a nightmare. Your boy is getting worse, yes? Then it makes sense, the ghost month ends tomorrow at dawn. Arrive already! When the sun rises, the tie between ours and theirs will be broken. - and your son will be lost. - Stop it! - I cannot let a child perish. - Then do something! There is something you can try, but it is very dangerous. - What? - Come with me. Stand in here waiting, does it help your boy? The sacrifices that we make in streets are mere decorations. They allow the livings the illusion of security. When do we want something from the spirits, we have to sacrifice something precious. This time of the year, the worlds of the livings and the dead intersect, and the world is thrown into madness. Angry spirits, driven by vengeance are at the height of their power. But you have no choice, if you want to save your son, you must face them now. This will protect you. as will this. - What is that? - You'll take it with you. where am I going? The sad spirits are trapped where they suffered most. hurries, You only has it until sunrise. You will see with the eyes of the dead, but don't let them touch you. they cannot touch you unless you allows it. Don't allow it, Or they will trapped you in their world as they did it to your son. The angry spirits become demons. They are devious and come in any form. The orange is for the guardian demons, to buy yourself entrance. The drum will call the dead. Tap it only once. And the final step... the needle holds a poison thay will bring you to the brink of death. To see as the dead do, you must join them. I can't do it. - Sarah - Jason, thank goodness that you are here. - What are you doing? - I am trying to save Sammy. - Is Sam here? - No. - Come on, I'll help you. Let's go, we got to go to the hospital. You are very smart for a woman. I come to you tonight. Uncle Raymond. - Raymond. I think that this one is done. - Good, they're expecting the shipment tomorrow. Are you spying on us? You never sent the bones, instead you sent the bears'parts instead. I knew that this one was going to bring trouble. How can they do this? The bones must go home. Let's send your bones home! No. - No, please, I don't tell. - Raymond. Did we trust her? - Raymond, please. - Shut up! For Mr Tsai, to you. She's not going to talk. Look at her. If you say one word, I'll cut you tongue out and made you eat it. Do you understand? Get back to work! We can't trust her. She would have talked. - We have to move her? - We can't move her now, wait till it get dark. She can help, since she made the mess. She can clean it. Mummy? Come here, let's go. Sarah, relax, Sarah. relax, relax. - Get them off me! Get them... - They are for your protection. The doctors want to be sure that you are not going to try to hurt yourself again, ok. You don't understand, we have to save Sam. Seetheart, the doctors said that they are doing everything that they can. - ok - What time is it? It's like 3:30 in the morning. you need to rest. We still have time, still have time, we have up till sunrise. Who said that? Shall we call a doctor? Let's asks her. - Ask her about the bones. - What bones? Where did you hide the bones? You did not send any of them back to China. Did you? - I am upsetting her. - You worked them to death, and you did not even have the decency to put them to rest. - I am going to ceck on Sam. - Stay away from him! Don't let her near him. Listen, listen to me Your uncle and your aunt, they ran a a sweatshop. - and they killed a girl. - What are you talking about? Her name was Chen Lu. She saw what they were doing and they killed it. - Sarah, hears what you are saying... - The spirit of the girl has Sam. We have up to the sunrise to find her bones otherwise we will never get our boy back. Sarah, I love you. I am going to check on Sam, check it by myself Is it ok? - I will be right back. - Don't leave me. Takes me with you. It may be a matter of hours. I am very sorry. - Who was Chen Lu? - What did you say? Chen Lu, - did she work for you? - Many people worked for us. What do we pay to the persons what worked for us? - Why will you ask such a thing? - Because I want to know. I want to know if any of them move on, went to school, started their own businesses... Enough! Those people worship us. They did what they were told and they w ere grateful for it. Really? So, you did run a sweatshop. And what about Sarah, my wife? What else did she say is true? - I do not know what to do. - I need you to trust me. Please. They are still doing it. Shouldn't you be in the hospital? What the hell is going on here? Do not be an idot, it's just a business. Yes, but that's my company. You've been using me. They walled it up. There was there a room back there where they dumped the bones. - Your woman is crazy. - Easy. Hey, what are you doing? - Tell me how to get in there. - It has nothing to see. What have you done? Sarah, no! You have your bones. Will this save your son? We'll send you home. Please, Can we have our son back? Let's go. I don't know what to say, It's a m iracle. Can we go home now?
