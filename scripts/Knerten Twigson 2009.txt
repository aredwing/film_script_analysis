They gave me this bust for free. It just might do the trick. Right, Phillip? - Bye-bye! - He drives like an idiot! Come back inside for a little while. Wait for me! I'm not finished! I saw a princess. - There is our dream castle. - Wow, it's beautiful. Yes, it is nice. - It's even nicer than I remember. - Yeah, much nicer. This is our new home. Do you like it, Junior? It's really, really old. Just needs some paint. Oops, it's okay. Easy enough to put back in place... - There are no houses around here. - Nope, not a house within a mile. - Look, an ant! - Yes, that's how it is in the country. - Are they dangerous? - No, not too people. - Your very own room, huh? - Will you read this to me? Now? No. You can start unpacking your boxes. - The carpenter is here! - Be right there! Hello! Junior. I've been a carpenter for over fifty years. This house is completely rotted. No, it'll be just fine. I'm just going to. - Like that! - Hey, keep the door open! Over there, please. In the corner. Or hang on. Could you put it over there instead? - Here? -No, wait. Bring it back over here. - Please make up your mind, Ma'am. - Okay, just put it down. Junior! - Hey. Sweetie? - It's okay. Drip Board, window frames, floor. It's a real money pit. Thanks. No receipt necessary. Where are all the other kids? I think the carpenter left his hammer over there. Go find some nails and see if you can build something! Never give up, Junior. I'll hold it for you. Hey, hey, easy now. Good. Well done! Let me get it for you. - There we goo. And that one? - Yes. - What are you making? - A castle. A real castle? The sky is our limit. Like that? I think you can manage by yourself now. All done. - What are you doing? - I'm cutting some twigs. - So you are "twigsing"? - Yes... Twigsing! Step aside, here comes a big one. Will you be home more now that you don't have a real job? - I have a real job, just a different job. - Selling underpants? That's right. One must never give up, you know. Just keep going and going. - Okay, Daddy. - Watch out! - Daddy, look!. - Yeah, put it inside by the fireplace. This is your house. What's your name? "My name is... My name is..." My name is... My name is Twigson! What's yours? - I'm Junior. - Twigson and Junior. - Good day. - Daddy, look. He's shaking my hand. - Wait! What's on the path over there? - It's the dragoon. Bring it on, Mr. dragon. We're not afraid of you! - I thought dragons were dangerous? -No, not too us! I'll stab you with my sword! Are you scared, Junior? -No, I am not! - Me neither, actually! - We're going to save the Princess. - She's captured in the dragon's cave. Here come Twigson and Junior, the brave knights! And at my last strike, my sword got stuck in his teeth. I made him run for his life! It's the carpenter. Hey, he's going to... he's going to crush my house! Junior. Wanna know something? I'm in the middle of an ant hill! Help! Get'em off of me! - They were trying to eat me! - No, they just bite a little. Oh no. That little one who's running away, he took a nibble of my hand! Those ants are wood eaters! You don't want those in your home! - Don't go anywhere. - Nope, I'll stay right here. Junior! Help me! Junior! I am innocent! I am innocent! I've never done anything wrong! Help! - Open a window! - I have already opened all the windows! - I don't believe this. - Twigson! I'm coming! You can't be in here right now. Go on. Goo outside! - You were trying to burn Twigson! - Broken chimney? Great. - Everybody out! - It's like this with old houses. - Is that Twigson? - He talks too. Isn't that right, Twigson? That's nice. Are you okay? We all need too help out around here. Take that stool up to your room, okay? - You too, Phillip. - Sure. - It's okay. - I think it's your bedtime. - Now? - Yes. Going to bed at six? Not even shrubbery goes to bed at six. - Why didn't you say something? - Well, he's your father. Besides, I was still in shock. I'd just been burned. It was terrible. The flames. And I'm like: "Hello, isn't anybody going to save me?" But then I showed up! Riding on my horse! And just as the flames were about too eat me. I saved you! - I am a little tired after all. - You better sleep with me. - Good night, Junior - Good night, Twigson. Help, help! Help! - Of course I'll sell the lingerie. - Things did get a little more expensive. - Look at this one. - It goes really well with these two. My complements on your bust, Ma'am. Oh, hello. You're up early. Twigson dreamt that the ants were chewing on him. - Oh, really? - Are you leaving already? Yeah. Daddy's going out too sell some underpants. Go upstairs and wake Phillip up, will you? We need to get going. Okay. Sure. Phillip. Phillip! - Nothing can wake him up. - But we never give up. Daddy said so. And said is said. - What the...? You bloody... - Daddy said to do it. - Mom! - Phillip? You're going too school, right? - Are you throwing them out? - Yes, it's the wrong color. - Look. Noobody wants to wear that. - Twigson wants them. Okay, here you are. Come here! It just needs a little paint. It'll be okay. Watch out. Howdy, little fellow. Yeah, we were wondering who'd moved in over there. - We're very happy to be here. - Nobody's lived there in ten years or so. And Anders was very pleased with the price. He never expected to get that much. Look over there. You just wait right here. NOW HIRING SALES LADY WANTED - What''ve you got there? - Nothing. It looks like a pig. Give it to me. Yes, Mother. - Look at this store! - I've ordered everything. They've got everything here. I did put up the note! I've got a wife. No, customer. Welcome. How can I marry you? I would like to get my deposit back on these. One can deposit bottles here. Look... over there. There's tons of stuff behind the counter. - I want too sit in the front. - I want too sit in the back. This is quite some store, Sir. Hardware, notions, dairy produce. Phillip could use this. - Are you girls buying anything? - No, we're just looking. - Get out! - Help me, Junior! - No children allowed. - Okay. I told you to wait outside, Junior. - That's nice. - Yes, that's bloody nice. - Oh, look how cute they are. - Yes, they're so bloody cute. - A dress! I hate dresses. - Mama. Mama. No, no! Help me. Mercy! Mercy! No. Twigson, I'm coming! Come on. Let's goo home to my place. - No, it's my turn. - You always decide. I never get to decide anything! Ouch! It's okay. Thank you, Junior. You're a real hero! Mr. Eilertsen. He's a character. The store is the least of his problems, too put it that way. - Whoo's taking our house from us? - Nobody. We just didn't anticipate that there'd be this much work. So we need to be careful with our money. At least until Daddy sells his products. - The underpants? - Yes. - He'll sell them, though. - Yes. Twigson's really hungry, because he has sold a lot today...over a thousand. - Maybe he should be excused, then? - Yes, me too, please! - Are you sure you've had enough? - Have you had enough, Twigson? We are bloody full! - What did you just say?! - I know how we can make more money. - It sort of depends on Junior, though. - Are you going to sell me? No, we are not going to sell you. But I've got a job. - Really? - Yes, at the grocer's store. The owner is in a nursing home. So therefore, her son needs help. The store is actually the least of his problems, from what I've heard. But I'm only helping out around the store, of course. Full time. - But. What about us? - You will have to go with me, Junior. Maybe you can take the bus home with Phillip? - Phillip! We all have to contribute. - I'm full. - Then you better excuse yourself. - May I be excused, please? - Do you think you could manage, Junior? - Yes. It's a great idea! The house turned out to be so expensive, you know. But now you and I can work at the store and make money for a new chimney! Ouch! - Watch out. - Yeah, yeah. - Howdy, little fellow. - Here they come. Thank you. Check out his hair. Look, it's the king of bra's! - Hold still! - Want me too cut your hair too? Scissors, anybody? - Do you have a pair of scissors? - No. Take it easy, his father actually wears a bra. - Does he? - No. Where are we going? You sit right here. I'll bring your lunch out in a couple of hours. - Am I not coming in with you? -No, kids are not allowed in there. And silly me didn't tell Mr. Eilertsen about you. But Twigson's here with you. I'm sure you'll come up with lots of things to do. You can go exploring! Hey, Junior. Did we just get fired? We can still make money, though. We just pretend like we don't know your mother. - Junior! - I would like my deposit back on these. Okay. Here you go. Let's take this off. Twigson and I are saving up money for a new chimney. That's great. You better goo back outside. Okay? Deposit, the possum, deposit Oh yeah! Deep in the forest, sneaking around Sniffing and searching look what I found Tougher than anyone, looking around Now you must wait here for Phillip, okay? Just stay right here. There you are. Looking for bottles, guess what I found Which is the wealthiest animal in the forest? "The possum it"! Always slick and smooth, so proud and stout Finding bottles everywhere, so watch out! Always slick and smooth, so proud and stout Finding bottles everywhere, so watch out! Sniffing and searching, sniffing and searching Wealthiest in the forest! Be aware of the possum, he 's here and he 's there Searching for bottles, he is everywhere Deep in the forest, sneaking around Sniffing and searching - look what I found! Always slick and smooth, so proud and stout Look, Junior. A whole crate filled with bottles. Finding bottles everywhere, so watch out! Always slick and smooth, so proud and stout Be aware of the possum he 's here and he 's there Deposit, the possum, deposit, the possum, deposit! Wealthiest in the forest... Look, the crate's been filled back up. Vivien Luckyboard! I 've been look in g forward to this movie. - We should watch that one. - Yes. - What animal? - Is the most wealthy? - What animal? - Is the most proud? - What animal? - Is the most stout? - What animal? - Is slick and smooth? Be like a possum! Deposit Boy! Welcome back Deposit Boy's been here. He brings us the same bottles over and over. I never thought I'd see the day! - Auntie Everywhere! With a cane? - Yes, imagine that. It happened last Thursday. I was on my way down too Mr. Tupes with his dinner. And I'd forgotten to feed Reidun's cat. So there I go, back and forth, up and down. But when I had reached the bottom of the hill - - I decided to take the short cut over the brook. And you know the old root ball sticking up there, right? Well, one of the loops on my boot got caught so I lost my balance! But do you think. I fell in? Oh no, not this lady. I stretched out like an arch across the brook! But... Just as I thought I was safe... Oops! Twigson told me too do it. I don't want too see you here ever again, Deposit Boy. Let me take him. I told you not to come inside! You've been stealing bottles! I could lose my job over this. You sit right here! We were so close to getting busted! If the clerk had asked me if I knew your mom, I don't think. I could've lied. Your mom is good at keeping secrets, though. It's stopped raining. You can get some rest now. - Where is it? - At home. Give us the doll. - What is this? - A stick. This isn't just a regular stick. This is a soulful piece of wood. - How does he know that? - How do you know that? It's my job. Too see what's any good. But you know all about that. You're a home builder. - I wanna make a bed for Twigson. - For Twigson? - But the nails are too big. - Really? Well, we can't just stand here. Come on. - I'm not allowed in the store. - What nonsense! They can't turn down a customer. There you go. Take this. Mom. I'm a customer. Is that your soon? Yes, unfortunately. I'm sorry, sweetie. I didn't mean it like that. - You understood that, right? - You probably have a husband too, then? Yes, I do. Ma'am. Deposit Boy is welcome at the store. - Thank. you. Thank you so much. - Easy now. - I thought you didn't like kids. - Well, I'm glad you're here. Wouldn't it be good for you to get away for a while? Meet some new people. - Look at this. - No. - I can look after the store for you. - You're moving quickly. From Miss to Mrs. in two minutes. And now you want too take over my store? Yes. Just like that! Does this bed seem soulful to you? - Stop it. I'm studying for a test. - I'll go show it to somebody else. Just because he gave us the nails, doesn't mean it's safe to goo see him. What if it's a trap? What if he nails me too the wall? Then what? - Are you scared? -No, I'm not scared. - Are you? - No. But what if he gets out his big saw and starts sawing me? I bet you'll be scared then. He's probably out of town. Let's just go home. Oops. I guess he's home, all right. - Come on, Junior. - It's okay. Let's just thank him for the gift, and then go back home. Right. And Twigson too. - Thank you for the nails. - Sure. And then go back home. Go home. - Bye. - Don't you want to come inside? - No! - Yes, please. How did you make these? It's not up to me too decide. The wood decides. Just look at it closely, and it will speak to you. These two were inside the wood all along. I just happened too notice them. I just helped them get out. - Just like you did with Twigson. - Twigson speaks to me. Yes! That's what I'm talking about. - Let's have a look. - I used a lot of nails. Nails are great. There, just like that. What? Oh, well isn't that nice. -Remember to turn left, now. - I will. I really like the carpenter. I always liked him. - You didn't like him before. - I just said that maybe he wasn't home. That bed you made for me is so wonderfully nice and soft. And it's got so many nails. It's really well made. Left! I'm from the forest, you know. I know all these trees. That one over there's Per, and he's Per. And the one behind him is also Per. There's nothing dangerous about the woods at night. It's just that the path seems a lot longer. This really is a long path. Wow, that's definitely not a Per. Yoou know what, though. I don't know these trees. It's the dragon! - It's the Princess! - The Princess? I wouldn't trust a girl for a second. Girls have doll buggies! They make me wear a dress and kiss me! I get all blushy barked by the thought. Hey, are you listening to me? Junior! Junior! Daddy! - Where have you been? - I went too see the carpenter. What were you thinking? You can't just walk over there! I saw a dragoon, and a riding princess. Enough about princesses and dragons! Your mother is very upset. Hey, listen. It's just that Daddy's struggling to sell his things. He got mad at me for visiting the carpenter. I saw a dragoon, and a horse and a princess. - Nobody believes me. - I do. Did you get a haircut? You look stupid. Go to sleep. - There are ants in our walls. - Inside the walls? Twigson had a dream about it. - You can't come to the store today. - But I need too help out. Not when you have a fever. - Will you be gone long? - A week, max. Mr. Eilertsen is in Spain. Could you and Twigson be home alone for a little while? - Sure. - Great. I'll make you some sandwiches. Yak! Daddy? Let me see! - Oh no! It's a giant ant! - A dragon! - It's locked, it's looked, it's locked! - Wait, that's not a regular dragon. It's a dragoon with a key! Go away, dragon! Twigson will beat you up! Hello? - So this is where you're hiding? - It's okay. - I'll stay until your mother gets back. - Auntie Everywhere? Yes. That's not my real name, though. I'm only Auntie Everywhere too little guys like you. A boy gave me that nickname. "Everywhere". Because I'd work a little here and a little there. - Like now, when I'm here watching you. - Twigson too. You and Twigson should take a nap. You are sick, you know. Twigson's not sick. He's just afraid of the ants. He's safe in here, then. Do you have a vacuum cleaner? Nothing like the ant colonies at the Watson's house. They would go too bed upstairs, - - and during the night, the ants had eaten the entire ground floor. In the morning, they could walk out into the front yard from their bedroom. There we go! No wall, no ants! At least you've got an open kitchen solution. I'll be back tomorrow. Free of charge, as long as I can bring along a little girl? Yes of course. Thanks you so much. One of the girls from the store? There! Yes! Now put a chair on top of the table. I'm leaving now! Take it easy up there. - Okay. - Bye. All right, I'll keep watch. - Are they here yet? - What? Hang on. I'm on the job! I can't really see anything. They're here! That doesn't sound good. I'm afraid I've gotten worse. Open the door. I need to take your temperature. - Better not. It might be contagious. -Oh, that's too bad. - You'll meet Tiny another time then. - Tiny? - Probably the one with braids. - You go outside now, Tiny. She'll destroy my house! - It's the Princess! - You don't know her. Come on! It's a girl. Junior. Hey, help me get back up. We don't like girls. Right? - Tiny? - Yes. Junior! Are you hungry, or are you still feeling sick? - Hey, where are you going? - I'm just getting something. But you're really sick. Hey! You'll get her sick as well. - Feeling better? - A little. May I eat on the stairs, please? Are you sick? You poor thing. - Wanna play? - Soon. - I knew it! Not that interesting, huh? - She wants too play. If you start playing with her, I'm gone! I'm serious. - Wait! What if I want to go with? - Whoo were you talking too? - No one. - Let's play with the guy in the window. - What's his name? - Twigson. - Hello, Twigson. Does he talk? - Yes. You look vey nice. "Thank you very much". You seem much better. Maybe you can come with me after all? Oh, she is so fine, she's in this neighborhood of mine Oh, she's got that smile And her laughter just makes you go wild If you 're feeling kind of low and lazy Go meet the girl that makes the world go crazy The girl just up the street She's the most amazing girl you could meet! She's got a heart of solid gold! Like solid gold! She's the master of Rock 'n roll! At least that's what I've been told The Princess with a heart of gold! - Wow, you've got the moves. - Yeah, there's hope. Or "vaya con dias", as they say in Spain. - You will meet her in a month. - Your girlfriend? - Here's a gift for Junior. - Thank you so much. Oh my... Now you just gotta get old enough to smoke. Would you like too come over to my house? - It's over there and to the left. - To the left, okay. Thank you. Twigson thinks you look. Like a princess. Daddy! - Don't run towards the car like that. - Come see the Princess! I could've driven over you. Wow, look at that. Hello. So...? - Nothing. - I see. Not even a sock We need to talk. The ants came gushing out of the wall. Thousands! - Imagine that. - Just like Twigson said. Did you make this bed all by yourself? Must have been a lot of work? I just listened too what you told me. Never give up. Junior, I think there's something wrong. Ouch! What does it say? Hou... hou... hou... HOUSE FOR SALE - Something about a house. - What does it say on the note? - Nothing. - Yes, it says something about a house. We'll talk about this when we get home. - Well, hello there. - We're closed! I'm not buying anything. I'm sorry you have to sell the house so soon, Ma'am. Moving twice in one year, huh? I have never moved in my life. Sometimes life is wonderful You and I, together here Playing hide and seek, or finding funny things When there 's you and I together I am smiling - Come on out, Junior. - I even cut my hair to fit in! Y ou guys don't think about our needs. Me and Junior! Just look at him! We exist, you know. It's not all about you two! - Junior, please. - No, I don't want to! I have to pack. He can come to work with me today. Maybe I'll even sell something. What's the point? We're moving anyway. Imagine having a very best friend Soon, we will be together again Tomorrow you and I will play together again When we 're together, it's okay It's okay It's okay It's okay, it's okay One must never give up, Junior. For sure it'll be okay! I need a Coke. Nothing beats it an ice cold Coke. Oh no! I tore my stockings! I probably have too go too Rome to find new ones. What? Are you looking at me? Look, it's Vivien Luckyboard! Gosh, oh my. It's Vivien Luckybooard, the movie star! Thanks, kid. This is the best thing that's happened to me since Rome. What...? Did you sell something? Excuse me? Do you have more of those colored stockings? We're out of the colored stockings. But we have a wide selection of other things. - Milk. Ham. - Ham... - Headcheese. - We'll put that here. Butter and cheese. - The orders keep coming in. - Crackers. - One must never give up, you know. - That's right - never give up! Milk chocolate. I'm changing my name too King of Stockings. The ladies' best friend. - Stop it... - No! One must never stop, never give up. I can work behind the counter, or wrap presents or something. You two just stay here and relax. But Phillip won't appreciate being woken up now that there's no school. I was thinking. Maybe you'd want an early Christmas present? Open your eyes. A sled! Well, open it and find out. King of Stockings. Long legs of all colors. We're going sledding with the Princess. You can stay in bed, though. Yoou know what? I can't wait too go sledding with the Princess. That's her house. It's almost like a castle. They should've cleared the driveway up to the castle. Look, there's even snow piled up in front of the door. Maybe they're in here? Tiny? Pegasus? They've moved away! Who are we supposed too play with now? I was so looking forward too go sledding with the Princess. Hey, slow down! You have to use the brakes. Don't just sit there! We're going to crash! Oh no. Twigson. Sit down. There you go. I have to go. Don't you want too take Twigson with you? The Princess moved away. - Twigson doesn't know anybody here. - He'll be all right. - Good choice, Dad. - What do you mean? Hello there, Junior. Hello Twigson. I brought Twigson's brother "swigson" with me. Look! There are other princesses around. - Those girls are not princesses. - No? What if they are? Let's go and buy some soda. Thank you for your attention. Now it's time to dance around the Christmas tree. - Can you hear me all right? - No! Thorben! - As I said, it's time to dance... - Wow, look at her! Mr. Eilertsen!
