Established in 1916. Exeter's population grew rapidly, resulting in overcrowd. There was rampant physical abuse and neglect. The children were no longer patients. They were inmates. Several died due to these conditions. So common were these tragedies that officials commissioned an on site graveyard But space eventually ran out. They simply erected a crematorium. Exeter was not a place where young people found help, but a place where they were discarded and destroyed. In the late 70s, the facility was shut down. For egregious human rights violations. It is rumored that the halls of Exeter are still haunted by the soul of all those who were wronged here. Sure is warm. Patrick, I'm getting hot under the collar.

Seriously, Drew... - You got to piss on the wall? - Oh, that's gross. That's Church property. It's holy water. Work here so. Where did they keep the shock therapy? - It's rehab. Not... asylum, dude. - Same thing. Those crackheads crack as wreck. Yeah. Did they teach you that at youth camp? Why, you been to rehab? All I'm saying is people have bigger problems than uh... what kind of pudding their mom packed for their lunch. Didn't this place used to be a nut house? Yeah, it's actually a psych hospital. It wasn't a hospital as much as it was a dumpster for human refuge Psychos, gimps. - Sorry. - Jesus. And then in the 80s. The church bought it and turned it into a rehab. Whoa whoa. You okay? Just let it out. - Yeah. - He's alright. Wait, why would the Church buy this place? It's 'cos it was fully equipped for Conway's fascist mind tortures. - Oh. Seriously, Knowles? - Yeah. - Yeah, I heard that. - It's true. There was a kid in here that went absolutely berserk. And all the other patients started going psycho. Suicidal, attacks and then Conway burned this place to the ground to cover his ass. Yeah, why would Conway torched a building Knowles. I'm looking it up here. "Local church shuts down rehab facility due to fire." He created that version and he blamed it on Rock 'N' Roll. - Oh, oh. Yeah , yeah, yeah! - You alright? - Forgot about the backmasking. - The backmasking, exactly. What is backmasking? It's when a band records messages backwards into their songs. The clergy convinced the parents that there were satanic messages in the music. And the press was all over it. Here. Check it out. Where? Exeter had become home to unconventional methods of punishment. resembling an exorcisms. The patient went missing in fire. There were vivid accounts of electroshock therapy Conway denied any wrong doings. And cited Rock 'N' Roll, an occult experimentation, as the cause of the arsenal. Yeah. Actually, there's this Emo girl on YouTube. Swears she can make herself weightless. - Pull it up. Pull it up. - I want to see. - That's fake! That's fake. - Look at that. - What the fuck... - Fake. - There could be something to this. - How? If you believe something enough. It effects you physically.

We take out their teeth. We saw them into manageable pieces, Melt them down in acid. Grind the remaining into a fine paste. Pour that shit in jam jars and then we're going to disperse them in dumpsters all over town. Any questions? Concerns? Where are we going to get jam jars. We are not dismembering a priest. - If they're identified, we're fuck Patrick. - Who cares if they're identified? We wiped our prints. Grab our shit and we bail. I'm going to fix this, okay. I promise you, Rory. I will fix this. Okay. I promise. Jesus, Patrick. - What are you doing? - Come on. Look at that. All one drawer for just one patient. Devon Ryer. Age 14, born addicted. Parents unknown. Escaped several institutions. Created by Father Charles Conway. Let me see that. Patient displays extreme violent behavior, pathological liar. sociopathic tendencies, does not respond to treatment. This is the patient that went berserk. I thought that was just a rumor. Maybe. Whatever happened to this kid is happening to Rory. - There's a tape. - Here. This was nothing like the symptoms of withdrawal. Davon exhibited extraordinary abilities. to manipulate people vicariously into erratic and sometimes violent behavior. Gavin, you have to talk sometime. or maybe you rather go back ... Devon's fucking freak out... Gavin! We then restrained and confined Davon. But this only seemed to intensify these abilities. Play it backwards. This place will burn! You hear that? Who is doing this? Someone lock the doors. Guys, come on! - We are locked in! - What? What the fuck are you talking about? - It's not opening. - Oh my god. Try the front doors. Fuck! Jesus, Knowles. - The whole place is on one system. - You work here. - So? - You have a key. - And why would I lock us in here? - Open the door, Patrick. Open the door! Open the fucking door! - I didn't do it! - Brad stop! Rory? What... the... - Shit. He's gone. - Damn it. Rory! Rory. Rory? Stay back. Christ sakes. What is this? You hold him down. I'll medicate him. He's possessed. Are you seriously that fucking stupid, man. You didn't see his face. Oh, come on. There's no such thing as possession. Okay. That's just something that Catholics made up to keep you guys going back for waffles This whole religion is one big fuck up costume party. There's no God. There's no Devil. It's idiots like you believe everything the... Holy shit! This that a sign of possession? Okay. So what kind of possession do you think that is? What kind? Because this is saying that not all possessions are caused by demon. but also by earth bound spirits. And this also saying that some of these verify vicariously behaviors that mimic possession. This is a Demon. Fuck. How did it get in? It says either direct invitation or reckless attempts at rituals under the extreme influence of mind altering substances. - Oh fuck. - Oops. Guys, we got to get it out of him. We can drive a stake through his heart. - He's not a Nosferatu , you fucktard! - Oh my god. He needs an exorcism, you assholes! A fucking exorcism. Okay, let's do it! Are you serious? Why not? I found a do-it-yourself site. - There you have it. [DIY EXORCISM - TEN EASY STEPS] - Let's do it. Do you know how insane that is? Do you have a better idea. Guys, this could work! Hey, get matches and bibles, okay. You get crucifixes. You get bubble wrap and lighter, Knowles, you get candles okay? - Go! Hey, go! - Remember this way. Come on, hon. - Bibles. - Grab all those. - Okay. - Grab all those. - What's that for? - Not to shake as brutal. Guys, I think that this whole do-it-yourself exorcism guide is a joke. We have to try. You'll never pull it off. You're just a hicktown douche. Not Father Merrin. Please choose the menu. Start incantations now. The power of Christ... compels you... Symptoms such as nausea and vomiting may occur. "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come..." Do not let the Demon intimidate you. The power of Christ compels you! In the likely event of an actual levitation. A vigorous application of holy water is recommended.

Shit! - I forgot about that. - I got a bottle of water. - It's gonna know, okay. - I can put it in a cup. - It's got to be blessed by a priest. - Not going to make a difference. - Not doing this without the holy water, guys. - Wait! We got a priest down there. Can we dip his finger in it? Like a tea bag... What the fuck, Patrick! Make a hole. - Where're you going? - You got something! He is alive. - He is alive. - Oh my God! - He is alive. - I thought you said he didn't have a pulse! I can swear he didn't. Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. - Oh my god. - You son of a bitch.

We are locked in. What the fuck is this? Dude. That's holy water, man. We have to find him. Well he's gone, okay. We would see him if he was here. He's gone. Maybe he knew a way out. - He could be bleeding to death somewhere. - He could be pass out in one of the rooms. Oh my god. He's gone okay? We should be gone too. - How do we know that? - Okay, should we at least look for him? Rory. Shit! Go. Broaden the shoulder, you're gonna mean that shit. Rory, it's okay. Don't let it intimidate you.

Fuck, fuck, fuck. Jesus Christ! Fuck! Reckless child. Rest. Rory! - Knowles! - Maybe they found a way out. No. They wouldn't leave without us. Knowles! Patrick. Look. Fuck! We'll find them, Patrick. Rory! Rory! Rory! Knowles' iPad. I'm Ryan Knowles. If you find this. I'm probably hacked up and dead like the rest of my friends. The crescent, I Google it. It's a Wicca sign. The summoning. True terrible things happened here. Restless souls, all brought upon us. by someone alive. And in this building... Knowles! Knowles! Knowles. Knowles. Get out! - Patrick! - Give it to me! - Knowles. - Oh my god. Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, he's dead! - Fuck. - Patrick, basement. Rory! Wait, wait, wait... Are you okay? Yeah, it's... Let's go, okay. Maybe it's a roary. Rory. Rory! Rory! Rory! Wait! It's Rory! It's Rory! Are you alright? Hey, did Knowles did this to you? It's.. It was Conway. He's...He said it was for my own protect or something. What are you talking about. Conway. He was talking about the apocalypse, the second coming. Dark entities. That's just fuck, man. - I almost suffocated. - Patrick, Patrick. Look. Devon spelled out a box. This is got to be it. Where's the corpse? Maybe there never was a corpse. What're you talking about? This is where Devon transformed. Into what? Remember what Knowles said. The summoning. Someone can call upon souls that were wronged, and make them carry out their will. While they stand there and watch. He was talking about a living person. - Where is Knowles? - Wait. Are you saying that Devon came back to life? Devon never died. Can we go? Jesus. Holy shit! I told you Conway was alone. No. There's no way he did this. 'Cos he just locked kids up in boxes. Guys.

No. No. No, no, no. No! No, no, no... No, no, no... Look at me, look at me. Look at me. No! Look at me! Fuck! Patrick. Patrick, I had to do this to protect you. This is the only way. Slay the flock that killed the shepherd... Father. Father. Father, look at me! What have you done? What have you done? Don't you understand? You have no comprehension of what you're dealing with. Devon was... no child. Devon was a vessel of evil. He was your son! I have no son. No. No. Patrick. I don't need your help! Patrick! You burn in hell! Patrick, no! Aww...! Oh god... [D].[E].[V].[O].[N] You never even asked my name. My mother love Father Conway. All she ever wanted was someone to care. But we weren't good enough. He abandoned us. And she couldn't handle it. But I grew to accept despair. And then at 13. I came here. I thought he could save me but he was ashamed. He locked me away. I survived so I could come back to summon all those wronged. I let Conway live. So you could kill him. I knew he would be hurt more by you than by me. My child. He cared more about those spoiled, pathetic drunks than his own flesh and blood. And you were his favorite, right up until you killed him. No, you made me do it. I didn't have to. You're just like everyone else, Patrick. You don't give a fuck who hurts as long as it is not you. She's lying! Patrick! Patrick! Rory! More chains! Go! This way! Bitch deserved it. No, she didn't. Did I kill the junkman? Don't tell mom. @KunalStark
