My clients are selling for four, leaving half a million in equity. Now, this is the deal. Oh, No. Richard, please sit down. I'll show this to my clients. Don't know if it'll fly, but we'll see. Hey, how's it going in there? Anything I can do? Listen, when Bill and Norah leave, I want you to pop your head into the conference room and I want you to say these exact words: "Your clients are leaving." Sure. Anything else I need to know? No, not yet. Hmm. Well? 3.5 million. We already came down from four. We'll only break even if we agree to three and a half. Do you trust me? We know you're working as hard as you can to close this deal, but that richard guy... is taking advantage of us. I know. That's why if you trust me, I want you to do exactly what I'm about to tell you. In 10 minutes, I need for you to get up, walk out of this office past the conference room, and out the door. I don't understand. We're in the middle of negotiating. Trust me. Haven't you ever done something without knowing the outcome? Wait 10 minutes, and go home. The next time you'll hear from me will be me calling to congratulate you. Do you understand now? Not really. Bill, let's just do what she asks. 'Kay. 10 minutes. Let me call you back. Well? Do we have a deal or not? What is it with you and this paper? Can't you speak? What did they say? Do we have a deal or not? You're crazy! No, they're crazy! 4.2 million? What is going on here? We made a fair offer and they're going up in price? They're tired of this back and forth, push and pull. And they said if you do not agree to it within 10 minutes, the deal's off the table. I don't believe you. 3.7 million is a lot of money. I mean, who's gonna walk away from that? Your clients? They're leaving? They're walking out of the building right now. Well, I guess that means the deal's off. What? After all the time and work I put into this? Go. Go get them. As I explained, they told me if I didn't come back, they were walking. Meghan, your clients are leaving. Okay, four. Four, and we go to close today. Now would you please go get them before they leave? Ah, tell my clients I'll send the paperwork over this afternoon. Okay. It's been a pleasure. Thank you. And congratulations on a great buy! I just closed the Smith's deal. Good. It's about time. No, I don't like any of it. Redo it. You, come with me. There's some people I want you to meet in my office. Meghan, I would like to introduce you to the Yakamoto brothers, Kana and hoshi Yakamoto. Gentlemen, this is Meghan Doherty. Konichiwa. Konichiwa. She will be heading your casino project. Mr. Whitaker, we have a lot riding on our deal. I understand. Meghan is my top investment banker here at the firm. We've revised our business plan to include photos of the extended land in the Mojave. I have been anticipating these plans for a few weeks now. And for our next meeting, we'll have an outline identifying your potential profit, risks, and facts underlining your investment. Now, that was different. To say the least. You have your work cut out for you now. So, we all set for tonight? The decorations are up. The caterers start serving at 8:00. Everyone knows to be at your house by 7:00 or die by the hands of Meghan Doherty. And Valentina knows nothing? She thinks we're doing sushi. I hear you're trying to close on the Yakamoto brothers' casino thing, Randolph. You think so, Al? Well, we'll see about that. You know, you've been trying to squeeze our company for years now, (and) it's not going to work. We're not giving in. I can't wait to show off my new outfit tonight. Like always. Are you implying that I'm self-centered? Mmm, that's right. The same self-centered friend who stuck my neck out to get you a job at the firm. How quickly we forget! [Al] Just remember one thing, Randolph. I am in first position on Eden Graham's Mojave land, and I will foreclose on Saturday, and when I do, well, the Yakamotos will be knocking on my door. Oh, it's the office. Hold on. will you? Hello? Meghan, I need you here tonight. Tonight? It's Valentina's party. Sir, all right. I'll be there by 6:00 pm, sir. I'll have time to stop by Jason's at Beverly Hills before I meet with Whitaker. I wanna get Valentina something special. So, what's new at the firm? I closed a big one today. You did? Congratulations! How's your car dealership going? Dealership is great. That's gorgeous! I have to get a gift for my friend. Oh, that's beautiful. Any interesting opportunities you can throw my way? Yeah. One of my clients is thinking of opening a chain of automatic car washes. Mmm, that sounds interesting. I know I did real well investing in the last exotic car business you got me turned on to. So how much? For you, 8000. That's retail. What's my price? Okay, I'll do 7500. Okay. 7000. But that's it. Deal. Uh, how much for that one? That one, normally it's 2000, but... for you, 1500. Could you box that also? Sure. So how's the Ferrari? Fast. You know, that's the only car I don't have in my dealership, so if you ever wanna get that thing off your hands, let me know. Let go of my pride and joy? Never. Jason, you know better than to ask me that. [Whitaker] The Mojave Desert. 5,000 acres of the Mojave Desert. We are going to build a casino resort, including an 18-Hole golf course and a country club. So what's the catch? Well, Graham Ministries owns 1,000 acres... right in the middle of it. The Yakamoto brothers are going to need... this one piece of land to build their vision upon. Now, this land is already in foreclosure. But the owner, Mr. Eden Graham, is not cooperating. And so, this land is going to go to auction next Saturday. But that doesn't give us much time. I know. This guy absolutely refuses to sell. Therefore I need you to drive up to the Mojave, and meet with Mr. Eden Graham. Meghan, you close on this deal, and we'll enjoy a celebration together. My dream will be realized... and guess who will be in line to fill my shoes? Hi! Valentina. I'm sorry I missed your party. No, you didn't miss it. You're here now, And this is how it should be, three best friends, enjoying each other. I knew when Whitaker called you to his office it would be a late night. We all knew that. We decided to wait for you. Guys, you are so sweet. Oh, I'm acting as if it's my birthday. Here. Oh my, look at this bracelet! It's so beautiful! - Okay, open. - Okay! Oh! Do you like it? I love it! Oh, thank you. Look what Adam got me. That is gorgeous! You must have spent your entire paycheck on that. Not all of it, but, yeah, most. Hi, mom. I finally caught you. Let me talk to her. Mom, I'm gonna give you a call back tomorrow. Wait, you were supposed to call me back yesterday. Good night. I love you. She has the worst timing. I have the biggest deal of my life and she calls to chit chat? Don't be selfish. It's your mother. You can't take two minutes of your time? Two minutes will turn into two hours. I just have so much on my mind with the Yakamoto account. Meghan, ever since I've known you, all you care about is money and your career. What's going to happen when you turn 60? You're going to wish that someone would call and visit you. And guess what? You are going to be all alone. You are just as old as I am. But I love my family. And one day I plan to settle down and have children of my own, so that when I get old I'll have someone to love me. Look at you! You don't date and you have no friends outside of Adam and me. It's late, and I have to prepare for the biggest presentation of my life tomorrow. That's right. Big presentation. I'll go get my computer so I can assist. You know that I'm right. Let me google "God's Country" and see what we're working with. What do we have here? God's Country is not just a getaway. it's a safe haven for those who need a break. In the middle of 1000 acres, we offer the best hiking, camping run by minister Eden Graham, second generation... Good night. Stupid shoe! Have they made it? Meghan, where are you? Have they made it? They are here now. Okay. And Mr. Whitaker is walking them into the conference room. Why didn't you wake me? I've been calling you all morning. I had Research put something together. It's on your desk. Okay. Offer them some coffee, tea, something to drink. Stall them. You want me to go into the conference room? But I... I don't have time for these questions! Just do it! Okay. Who do you like better? You like Matsui or Ichiro? Meghan is a couple of minutes away. She asked me to offer you something to drink. Coffee? Water? Tea? Tell Ms. Daugherty we prefer her presence instead of drinks. But since you're here, bring all of the above. Yes, sir. Anyway, my favorite player is Hideki Matsui. They're waiting for you. I stalled as long as I could. Here's your material. Oh, uh. Gentlemen. Thank you for coming. Shall we get down to business? We've identified your prospectus and have done an evaluation over the next 10 years, keeping in mind the growth rate of the surrounding Mojave area. Now, we see your casino not only as gambling for adults, and we believe you have an entertainment portal. We see the profit potential at a capture of 40% lift annually. Your investment over the course of 10 years will yield an annual $2 million, which by year eight, from your profit, your interest, and neighboring leases, your investment will be paid back in full. We at Whitaker & Associates would love to team up with the Yakamoto Brothers to turn the Mojave Desert into one of America's most impressive casinos. Whitaker & Associates is the most qualified financial organization to bring your astonishing vision to reality. Thank you. Excellent. Very good job. Arigato. I'm sorry. Could someone translate for me? I just complimented Ms. Doherty on her presentation. Excellent. Did you see the look on their faces? I did. We really won them over. You know, Meghan, I don't hand out compliments too easily, but you were outstanding today and I mean that. But before we start blowing our own horn here, we still have some unfinished business. Come on, walk with me to my car. All right, let's not waste any time with this. I want you to get up there as early as tomorrow. Have you assistant call ahead and set up a meeting with Graham. And Meghan, do not pull any punches with this guy. Let him know that you mean business, that nothing, and I mean nothing, will stop Whitaker & Associates from closing that deal. 'Cause you know what? I can feel it, God is on our side. So you close this. Hello? I thought maybe I'd have a chance to speak with my only child. but she's always too busy for her only mother. Sorry, mother. I've been swamped at work. Well, it must be going well. I received another check in the mail. What are you doing? Oh, every week the church hands out food donations to senior citizens. So I'm headed on over to the retirement home, which is where I'll be living in a couple of years. Mom, come on. You make me feel so guilty. Well, you should. What has it been, almost six months since I've seen you? You know what this coming weekend is. No, ma, I don't know what this coming weekend is. It's my birthday, Meghan. Listen, Pasadena is not that far from Los Angeles, so I don't wanna hear any excuses, and I don't want another check from you. I wanna be with my daughter on my birthday. Okay, ma, I will be with you on your birthday. I promise. Cross your heart? Cross my heart. Ha! Oh, I'm so excited I'm gonna see you finally! I love you. Love you too, mom. All right. Hello, Adam. Meghan, hey. Um, Mr. Whitaker asked me to get you on the phone. Oh, no. - Here he comes. - Get Meghan on the phone yet? Wait, what does he wanna talk about? - Yes, sir. - Adam, wait... Hello, Meghan. You're heading up there, I hope. Yes, sir. I should be there in a couple of hours. Good. Now listen to me. The Yakamoto brothers are scheduled to fly back into town this Thursday to finalize everything. I'm counting on you. I am depending on you to take care of this. - Yes, sir, I plan to. - Don't plan. Do it. Call me the second you have your meeting with Graham. Do not leave his side without signing those documents. Bye. "Close it." I'll close it. I'll show him. I'll make partner and force him to retire. Where am I? Hey, sir. Finally. Do you know where God's Country is? You need to go about 10 miles down the road, and make a right at the fork in the road. Make sure that you make the next right, not left. When you turn down that road, go straight, you'll run right into it. Got it. Two rights, got it. Miss, my truck over here... Okay. Whoo! Paris hilton ain't got nothin' on you, girl! Da-Da-Da-Da! I'm sorry, ma'am. Don't touch the car! Ma'am, it's not every day that a Ferrari pulls up. Hoo! Hey, my name is lenny. I'm one of the counselors here. Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't get your name. I didn't give my name to you? Listen, I'm looking for Mr. Graham. Is he around? Mr. Graham is always around. Well then, can you get him for me? I'll be right back. Hey, uh, Mr. Graham, there's a woman out here with a Ferrari. Really? Where's she from? My name is Doherty. Where, Where's she from? Mrs. Doubtfire, he wants to know where you're from. Doherty. My name is Doherty. Huh? I'm from Whitaker & Associates. Huh? Whitak... Oh, just... I'm sorry, ma'am. I just don't understand what you're saying. Mr. Graham, this is Meghan Doherty. I'm with Whitaker & Associates. My assistant called yesterday. - Hello, Mr. Graham? - Ma'am. Ma'am. What? If you wanna talk to Mr. Graham, you have to push that button right there. Where's his office? Where is his office? Incompetent people. Ooh, that's a nice ride! Hoo! One fancy automobile! Mr. Graham. - No, give me a hug. - What? Here we go. Ms. Doherty? Doherty. Meghan Doherty. Good to meet you. This is pastor Tinsley. How do you do? Pastor Tinsley, what do you think? Breathtaking. Pastor Tinsley's church is gonna be our guest all this week at camp. Mr. Graham, is there someplace we can speak in private? Well, sure. Right this way. Have a seat. I need to get right to the point. As you know, we're the lender in second position on your property. Mr. Whitaker sent me down here to discuss your property in its current state. You're in foreclosure, set to go to auction this Saturday. Since we don't wanna risk anyone else attempting to buy your property, I'm here to make you an offer and close on this deal today. Hmm. It's funny. I spoke to one of you people the other day. Now Whitaker's sending somebody down here to patronize me? Mr. Graham, I am not patronizing you. I'm here to make you a serious cash offer, an offer that I know is more than fair. Look, you're behind in monthly payments, behind on your taxes. We're just trynna help. All you have to do... is sign the power of ownership over to us and we can handle the rest. Ms. Doherty, I may be a little late paying this mortgage, but... I serve an on-time God, and he will deliver us from this financial hold your bank has on us. Mr. Graham... Do you know anything about this place? Or are you just down here to earn a commission? I'm here to do you a favor. Follow me. (I'd) like to take you on a little tour of the camp. A tour is not going to change the position you're in. Come on. What do you have to lose? Hmmm. I'm second-generation land owner of Graham Holdings. My dad was a minister. I use this land to give back to God for me rebelling against his righteous ways when I was a kid. Look at it. I love this land. There's no place like it. Our ministry's taken a big hit, just as I'm sure residential has. Churches can't tithe the way they used to or pay extras for the kids, (and) that trickles down to people like us. Meghan you can tell Whitaker I have to decline his offer. Listen, the deal is the deal. You can pray to your God any time, day or night, but it's not gonna stop the fact that out bank is gonna take this property. Take me back to my car. Meghan, I'll tell you what. I'd be willing to put my faith that God will come through (that) this will all be water under the bridge. If you just... stay here for six days. see what it is we do here. watch God's blessings unfold. and then if by some chance you don't see why this land is so important, I'll sign your deal before the land goes to auction so you can get your big commission check. Listen, take the check, gather your Christian folk, and go build a church in a new location, near a city where people actually live. Ms. Doherty, I know that as long as I don't put my signature on that document, I have a fighting chance to keep what's rightfully mine. No, it's not over till God says it's over. and God hasn't told me anything. So, why would me staying here for six days make any difference in whether or not you sign this deal? You'll be able to see what we do here with your own eyes. Maybe then you'll understand why I'm willing to put my faith in God and fight to keep this place open to help people in need. To you, this is just another business deal. This is my whole life. If it's more money you want, let me call Mr. Whitaker. Let's up the offer. You have my offer. Six days and I'll sign. That's my promise to you and to God. One condition: the deal remains between you and me. You can't tell anybody else. I don't want people around here to judge or treat you any differently than the rest of the guests. Ok? All right. Deal. Okay. I just need to make a few calls. Meghan. You scared the living daylights out of me. Sorry. Uh, we have a camp meeting in five minutes. About this deal, I need to go and make a call to my office. I need to go home and get some extra clothing, because the only clothing I have is what I'm wearing. Now, do you have a phone in your office I can use? Five minutes. And you can leave all your stuff in the car. No one's gonna mess with it. Five minutes. Hasn't anyone ever told them that staring isn't polite? Meghan, listen, why don't you join my church's ocngregation? You can be our special guest. Maybe you could teach my kids a little something about whatever it is that you do. They... They love your car. Sure. Whatever you say. Awesome. Thank you. Well, I guess somebody didn't get the camp memo about appropriate attire. I'm Jacob. Everyone around here calls me Jake. Well, Jacob, you can keep your smart comments to yourself. Ok, I just saw you walk in here with my father, and I can tell by the way that you're dressed that you're obviously not one of the church group leaders. So, why are you here? I'm here for the same reason as everyone else. Enlightenment. Now I don't know who you are, but... I'm sorry, did you just say that was your father? Yeah. I run this place with my parents. I'm the head counselor here. Sorry. Meghan Doherty. Hello, everyone. Welcome to God's Country. I want you to shake away all the worries of your day-to-day rat race and peer pressure, and especially video games, social networking, and... texting. You're here to relax, make friends, and most of all, discover that real inner love of self and God's spirit. Before we begin, I want you to turn to the person to your right and left, and give them a big, welcoming hug. Oh! Hey. Okay. Oh, my... Meghan, I'd like to introduce my better half over here for almost 25 years now, Caroline. She's sort of the mother hen, caretaker of the camp. So if you get sick, bitten, or just plain homesick, she's... - Bitten? - Honey, stop it. He's just pulling your leg. If it was the summer time, yes. But in the cooler months we don't have that problem. Good to know. Oh, hey, Meghan, this is Geri. She's one of the counselors here. You guys should... Hi! Are you a model? You're so pretty. I know your feet must be killing you in those high heels. Uh, Geri, go fetch Meghan a pair of your boots. Oh, no. They'll probably be a little too big, But they'll give your feet a much needed rest. Just show me to my room, so I can get on my laptop and make a few calls, and I'll be awesome. Meghan, you're kinda missing the point of what we do here in God's Country. And that is? Off the grid. Here you go. Anyway, welcome aboard. Grudge match. Ping pong. Let's go. You wanna watch? I'm gonna watch. Ok. Those are for you. I'll take you to your trailer. You're gonna want those. I'm not wearing them. My trailer? What is this? Well, this is your living quarters. Sorry it's not the plaza hotel. I am not staying in that. Well, it's stay in that trailer, or in the house full of teenagers. Here or there. What have I gotten myself into? Gross! Get it off! What are you doing, stalking me? No, I just came by to see if you were okay. I am not okay! I hear these things howling at me and there was this big bug... Wait. A bug? Yes! Are you laughing at me? Wait a minute. What are you doing? Hey, mom? Yeah, honey. Can you send Geri to trailer number one, please? What's up, Jake? It's Meghan. And a bug. It was a big bug. Big. Sorry. A big bug attacked her, and now she refuses to go to the trailer. You want me to send someone to stay with her? Affirmative. Okay, honey. I'll tell Geri. Bye bye. Thanks. It was a big, big bug. Yeah. It's all clear. Hi again. Are you always so petulant? Oh, um... They actually said that you needed a little help out here, so we're gonna be roommates now. I hope that's okay. You're not too adjusted to the wild, huh? - That's okay. - Well, now you've a bodyguard. Thank you. Okay. Okay. This is for you. What is this? Um, Mr. Graham said that you needed some clothes to wear, so I just brought you some of my own. I'm not wearing that. We don't get any signals out here. What, are you guys in the 1800's? How do you live like this? Live like what? Like this. No cell phone, Wi-Fi. What are you supposed to be proving? (We're) not trynna prove anything. We're actually just in the middle of nowhere. Hey, Meghan. What? Do you mind if we just say a quick prayer before we head in for the night? Pray on. Okay. You've reached Meghan Doherty. Please leave a message. Meghan, bet you've wrapped Graham and those documents around your little finger today. I can't wait to hear about it. Call me. Meghan, wake up! Meghan. Meghan. Meghan. Wake up, sleepyhead! Rise and shine and kick out the glory, glory What time is it? It's 6:00. 6:00 a.m.? Yeah. Come back at 10:00 a.m. I don't do breakfast. Geri, where's Meghan? She wouldn't get up. Jake, will you ask pastor Tinsley to start this morning's prayer service? Yeah, you got it. Thanks. Be right back. All right, y'all, how's everybody doing today? What is wrong with you? We're having prayer before breakfast and you have to join your assigned group. Listen. I'm tired. I am not going anywhere. And I've agreed to stay here for six days. You agreed to be part of the journey. Being part of the journey means taking the journey. Now (if) you don't show up for your assigned group, our agreement's off. You can get back in your fancy car (and) drive back to Los Angeles today. Okay. I get your point. Let me just go take a shower... No time for that. You gotta meet your group. Breakfast is in 15 minutes. Get up, throw some water on your face, I'll see you out here. Jake, do we know where your father is? There she is. Meghan, I think we can all sit down together, and eat as a family. Hmm? Let's bow our heads in prayer. And Jesus said unto them, "I am the bread of life, He that cometh to me shall never hunger And he that believeth on me shall never thirst. Amen. Now we can eat. All right, gang, remember this is a contest, so there are special reward activities for the group that pulls together and does the best job. The first activity is a two-Mile hike up to the tennis courts. So, Lenny, it's all you, buddy. Wait. You all right? I am not dressed for a two-Mile hike out in this jungle. I'd actually be more worried about the snakes. Come on, I'm just kidding with you. I got your back. You're gonna be all right. Thank you. Okay, let's go for a hike! You've reached Meghan Doherty. Please leave a message. Hola, Meghan, you've been gone for two days now. We all know when you're working on a big deal you stop communicating, but you missed our weekly facial appointment today, and that's not like you. Okay, call me. Bye. Group three, we're here, and you might notice that there are no tennis rackets. But... We do have these. Oh, no. It is bad enough that we hiked two miles, And now you expect us to work? Come on. It'll be fun. You'll have fun. We're gonna clean this place up. We're gonna get it nice and beautiful. What is fun about hiking two miles to clean a tennis court? Listen, it's not about the work. It's about us working together as a team. I can't believe what I'm hearing. It's like you're brainwashed. Okay. We'll start on this end, and we gotta work our way back. Let's do it! Hey, Meghan. Everything okay? No. What do kids learn from hiking two miles up to a tennis court covered in weeds? And guess what? Here are some gloves and shovels and let's clean the tennis court and learn about the good lord. Hmm! Calm down. I am not going to calm down! Why don't you just sign this document? Just give up already. There's nothing you can do to save this land. Ok, I get it that you are a man of God and you live off this and, but I don't see a miracle that's gonna come out of the sky and save this place! You done? No. Do you want more money? 'Cause if you want more money, I can get you more money. What is it that you want? Ms. Doherty, We have an agreement. I plan to stick to my end if you stick to yours. Now if you don't get back to your group, deal's off. Well, welcome back! I need a facial and a makeover so bad. Wow! You look so different. You look really pretty without makeup. Ugh! My body hurts so bad. Have you ever had a facial or? No. No. Sit right there. 'Kay. You have pretty healthy skin. You should take care of it. Oh, I wash it with soap. Soap? Soap is the harshest thing on a lady's skin. My friend Valentina and I, we get a facial once a week. Oh. I feel like my face is cracking. Wanna see? Good morning! What time is it? 5:45. Why do we have to get up so early? "Early to bed, early to rise, makes a girl healthy, wealthy, and wise." All right, I know that's not in the Bible. How did you sleep? Gosh, last night was so special. Just, it was like... almost like I had a sister. Ouh! Oh, are you okay? It feels like someone's poured concrete down my back. Oh no! Listen, why don't you just go ahead and tell Mr. Graham that I can't get out of bed because my back hurts. Just go ahead. Okay. Hello, Meghan? My... uh... My dad asked me to come check on you. Meghan, are you all right? I'm gonna come in. Are you dressed? Ouh! Ouh! Are you okay? I'm all right. I... just strained my back from pulling weeds yesterday. I thought I had some Ibuprofen in the car. Well come on, let's get you some aspirin. You wouldn't happen to know where there would be a phone I could use. Um, yeah, well, the only phone's in my father's office. Other than that, the closest phone's about 10 miles away in the nearest town. I could ask him if you like. Oh, no. I guess I could drive you to town if it's that important. Yes, it is that important. Just far enough until I get some cell signal, and then I could make the call. Yeah, sure. Come on. We'll take my car and we'll be back before lunch. Yeah, all right. Where are you guys headed? Oh, she needed to make an important call and use the phone. I didn't want to bother you. Is that right, Meghan? Yeah. That's right. You okay? Yeah. All of a sudden I just feel sick. Maybe Carol can help her with her sudden sickness. You know, I think I'll be okay. I just need to sit down and rest. Run! Run! Come back! Come on, come on. Come back! Come on. Let's go! Come on! Run, run! Go, go! Come on! We would have won if I didn't have to run two legs of the race. Yeah, what's her problem? She scared of breaking a nail? So how do you feel? I still feel a little dizzy. I understand if you wanna leave, but... I wasn't trying to leave. I will be here until next Saturday, 'Cause we agreed that you would sign that deed. And I'll be here to personally hand it to you. It sure looked like you were trynna leave today. I wasn't trying to leave. I was making a call. My job is at stake and I needed to let Mr. Whitaker know it's taking a lot longer than I thought. Meghan, the point is to leave that behind. You being here is about resting and getting in touch with God. Calling Whitaker is not gonna change that or speed up the process. You are just so in control. But you know what I've figured out? You're the only one who knows how bad things are around here. And you're the only one who knows that this may be the last week this place is in business. (I) wonder how your family would feel if they found out. You threatening me? You've reached Meghan Doherty. Please leave a message. Meghan, hey, it's me. I've been calling for three days now. No one in God's Country is answering the phone. So, if you had closed the deal you would haves called by now, right? I'm really getting worried. Hola, Meghan, soy yo. It's Valentina. I wish you would just pick up the phone. We are all trying to locate you. I really hope that Your not calling has anything to do with our discussion the other night. I'm so sorry. I miss you. Please, just... just call me back or, or call Adam, okay? All right. Bye. gotta love it in God's Country nice! You know what, I was just thinking something. When I was a kid growing up in California, one of the things that I remember the most was spending the holidays together with my family. And even though we were all packed in there, it was a tiny little two-Bedroom house, - I was the runt, - Rightfully so! Right? I slept on the floor. I had my brother here, I had my sister here, these cousins everywhere. I never felt crowded. Never. You know what I felt? I felt love. I felt togetherness. I just don't think there's anything that can replace that feeling, that feeling of being together with your family. Amen. I think maybe we should take a little moment here to realize how lucky we are to be here with each other. Amen. You know. Okay. All right. (I) Guess I'm sorry if I got you into any trouble this morning. No, you didn't get me into any trouble. I do have a question for you. What's going on? Why is my father hovering over you like a mother over a new born baby? When I came here I told him that I needed help. And so he agreed to help me and treat me like everyone else. (I'm) Not being nosy, but help you with what? Don't worry. I'm not a drug addict or anything. I'm a workaholic. And so it's work that I think about all the time and hence I'm up here for rest. Hence, no cell phones, no computers, None of that stuff. That's what your dad's been helping me with. Yeah, well, he can be bullheaded and stubborn sometimes. Tell me about it. How's your back? You know, it's... still a little tight. But I think the aspirin has helped ease the pain. So what do you... So tell me about Jake. I've been a counselor here since my parents owned and ran the place. I left for a couple of years to go to college and business school. And then I came back to help my mother and father run it. Where did you go to business school? Harvard. You went to Harvard business school? Yeah. What are you doing here working as a counselor? Well, who needs Wall Street? You know. I came here to learn how to build the perfect bonfire. Plus I make one heck of a smore. Listen, do you wanna come with me? There's something I wanna show you. Okay. So, this is my vision. I wanna build a Christian college with full student housing. Uh, the campus will be a state of the art college with full academic curriculum. And the students, they can earn college credit and they can earn scholarships by working at the camp during the summer. This, um... Well, this is a day care center for single mothers who wanna attend college. This is student housing. Oh, and look at this. That's the student activity center. I'm impressed. Does your father know about this? Oh, yeah, of course he does. I mean, we spent thousands putting together a business plan with some really solid projections. And we can get state funding, tax relief. But, I'm talking about building an entire infrastructure here, I mean electricity, sewage, water, paving a road that goes all the way to the highway. I'm sorry. Am I boring you with this? No! No. So why haven't you put this plan into action? Graham Estates is a nonprofit organization. It raises most of our funding through church offerings. With the economy hitting all churches, big and small, it's put our entire organization into flux. What we need is a venture capitalist to invest, but so far efforts have fallen on deaf ears. Our vision is not their vision. My family... We really believe in helping those who need help. It's God's way. Paperwork looks good. And we are ready to move forward with Whitaker & Associates. Mr. Whitaker, one question: Where's Ms. Doherty? Have you heard anything? Nothing. Adam, I'm worried. My brother thinks she's very impressive. It's been four days! Okay, hold on. - Ms. Doherty? - Yes. Valentina hasn't heard anything. ...and she is. She is very impressive indeed, And right now she's away. She's handling... some very detailed business, but... I don't know what to do or how to reach her. Why doesn't someone just drive down there and make sure she's all right? ...I can assure you that everything is going to plan and the closing will take place on time. How's the weather over there, Hoshi? Mr. Whitaker doesn't wanna go down and interfere. He'd prefer for Meghan to call in. She's working on some really big deal for the firm. I don't know much about it though, other than it's worth a lot of money. Forget Whitaker and how much money this deal is worth. What if she's in trouble? What if she needs our help? Anything could have happened to her. You get on that phone and call the state police and place a Missing Persons Report. Don't just sit around and do nothing. You hear me? Okay, well, look, Mr. Whitaker says if she doesn't call in the next couple of days, he'll go down there himself. All right? I gotta go, though. Okay, bye. You can't keep putting this off. What are you going to do? I don't know. We've tried her cell many times. There's no answer. Adam, our friend is missing. If you're not going to call 911, I will. Well, you decide. If I call 911 and she's okay, I risk blowing her deal and my job. How's your back? My back's doing good. Hey, Meghan, I could use your help on this pull. No! Come on! You can do it. Meghan! Meghan! Meghan! Oh, wait a second. Let me put my hair up. Bring it on, blondie! You're goin' down! You're goin' down. You got nothing. Grab your ropes, everybody! On your marks, Set! Come on, Meg! Pull! Bring it on! Okay, come on, come on! One, two three! Pull! Come on, guys! One, two three! Pull! Pull harder! - One, two, three... - Come on guys! Pull! One, two three! Pull! Great job! Meghan, he has never lost! That is amazing! Victory, baby! Victory! Great job. So this is it. This is what it's all about. Wow! This is your reward for winning at tug-of-war. You didn't let me win, did you? Trust me when I tell you this, I love to win too much to allow you to win. Oh, I... I have to go. Stay on task... Wait. ...It's not personal. It's business. Did I do something wrong? Can you take me back to camp? Meghan, so, I spoke to a guy out at God's Country, and he said that a Meghan Doubtfire with a Ferrari has been out there for the past five days. So what's goin' on? What have they done to you? Look, you know, I don't care about the Yakamoto deal. but if I don't hear from you by the end of the auction, I'm calling the police. So what do you do for a living? I'm in real estate. Oh, real estate. That sounds interesting. I wanna major in civil law. My father's a lawyer, so I get to see how he helps people out of tight spots. I can never see you as a person who'd major in law. Why, 'cause I'm not all glamorous like you? I always wanted to fit in with the girls, you know. It's just, I have four brothers. It's just easier to play rough, you know? I have an idea. Listen, why don't you come to Los Angeles for a weekend with me? Really? Yeah, we can... we can go shopping, and... Well, we could find you a new hair style. How does that sound? We could have some girl time? You know, just do a bunch of girl things. I would like that. Yeah? Sounds like something my mother and I would have done together. Oh, where's your mother? She died last year. I'm sorry. My father died when I was about your age. I did everything with him, and then... When he died I just lost interest in everything. Hey, you know what? You seem too nice to be a lawyer. All the lawyers I know are just ruthless. There's good and bad in everything and everyone. I wanna be a lawyer so I can... So I can fight for the people that can't afford to fight for themselves. You know, for example, say there's this big bank that locks an elderly couple into a bad mortgage, and then tries to evict them from their home for the money 'cause they're greedy. That's when I would swoop in, Superlawyer Extraordinaire, coming in, saving the day, saving the elderly couple, punishes the bank, does the right thing. I don't know, I think it'd be great. I know this verse on greed. Isaiah 56:11. "Yeah, they are greedy dogs who can never have enough." "They are shepherds that can not understand." Where are you, Meghan? This is what I was talking about, Jake. Luke 10:23. "blessed are the eyes that see what you see." How are you doing this morning? Great. Good to see you. Hey, Jake. Yeah. The truck. Where is it? Uh, right in front of the office. - Keys inside? - yup. Thanks, man. Come in, Meghan. Eden? Hi, Meghan. Have a seat. I have a confession to make. Mr. Whitaker didn't send me down here just to make an offer. There's a pair of businessmen, the Yakamoto brothers, and they're here to develop the land. They want to turn it into a casino and resort. It's a $100 million deal and I don't see any way that you could stop it from happening, especially since tomorrow is the auction. Thanks for the information, Meghan. There's nothing left for me to do but pray. Will you stop it? Right now is the decision! Mr. Whitaker is gonna come down the road any second now and just shut down the entire operation, including me. I get it. I understand. There is something really special about this land. But you have to be proactive. Jake shared with me the entire vision that you have to be able to build a Christian college. You gotta find someone to invest in it, to pay up the debt, to buy this land so you can put this camp back in operation. I've tried everything. I've called everyone I know with money that could maybe bail me out, but so far, no one. All I have left is my faith in God. Don't you understand? That's all I have left. But what about Jake and everyone else? Jake trusts you. He trusts that you and him are going to complete this vision. You're right. You're right. You're right about the whole situation. Just... Yeah. You know what? I'm gonna tell my family tonight. It's not fair to hide things from the ones you love. It's just not fair. They have the right to know. You're right. Okay. No. I want you to come with me. Can I have your attention, everyone? In John chapter 8, the passage states, "Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." Well, I have a confession to make about God's Country. We're in foreclosure. And as of Saturday we will be no more. The land will got to auction to the highest bidder. But the good news is, they made us an offer, and with the money, we'll be able to start over in a new city. Sure we can start over in a different city, but... I love this land. Wait. Why can't just call the bank and ask 'em to work something out with us? Because I am the bank. And... my boss won't bail you out of debt. There are some businessmen and they have made a very large offer for the land. Jake! You lied to me. I didn't lie to you. I just didn't know how to tell you. Lying and not telling are the same thing to me. Jake. Wait! It's not her fault. Yeah? Then whose fault is it? You hid this from me! What about the college? What about the vision that we had? Son, I know... Know what? That we're losing everything that we've worked for and you didn't have enough respect for me or the workers to tell us? Meghan, how... how could you do this to us? Geri, it's not her fault. She's just doing her job. Eden, how did all this happen? I tried everything I could to stop this. But uh... our time is short. I meet with Ms. Doherty tomorrow to finalize the paperwork. So, um, Let's enjoy the rest of the camp. Pastor, could you lead us in prayer? Sure. Dear heavenly father, we ask for your guidance and your wisdom, and that you may pour your blessing upon your work, your land, and your people. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. It's okay. I'm sorry. Hey. You know, as long as I can remember, this's been my spot to come (and) get away from the world, clear my mind from any worries, doubts, Fears. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to mislead you why I was here. I'm just doing my job. I should have known. Right? Like, who drives up here in a Ferrari? It's gotta be a banker or a lawyer, somebody self-oriented. Yeah, that would be me. I was exactly that person you just described when I came here. I was on a mission to close on this deal and get back in time to have drinks with my friends in the city. But something changed. After seeing all this, and you sharing your... your vision with me, and meeting everyone, I understand why your father doesn't wanna part with this land. This really is God's Country! Look, I know I can't blame you, but I don't have to like it. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I feel so bad. Don't. I realize that you were just doing your job. And... that I need to forgive you like Jesus would have. Do you wanna forgive me? Yes. Yes, I do. I... I really enjoyed what we shared together. And I learned that there's a lesson in every part of life and it is not your fault that this camp is broke. That's something that Jake and Eden and Caroline have to deal with. So... I'm gonna go for a walk. May I come for a walk with you? I'd rather be by myself. I just... I've a lot to think about. You've reached Meghan Doherty. Please leave a message. Meghan, Whitaker's furious. he plans to come out there if you don't call in. Your job's at stake. I hope you're doing the right thing. I should just close the deal and walk away. That's all you have to do. You've done it a million times before and it's gotten you a Ferrari, a home out in the Hollywood Hills. I mean, what more do you need? Who cares if I've taken away everything they care about? When have I ever cared before? Meghan, just stay on task. It's not personal. It's... It's business. It's business. Hey, pastor Tinsley! Meghan. How do you feel today? Confused. Okay, I'm listening. Yesterday I felt so bad, and... today is the last day, and I just feel like the executioner. You're a good servant. That's all God wants us to be is good servants. I guess I've just been experiencing this... overwhelming amount of guilt these last few days. If it's God's will, then it's his will. You're only his messenger. I just feel like there's something that I should do. If this is God's will then it's his will. Good luck. Everybody ready? Hey! Jake! Jake! Jake! -What? - Jake, listen. Grab your truck and come with me. What's going on? I don't have time to explain. Just follow me. Listen, Jake, I know you don't trust me, but I have an idea. (I've) had enough of your ideas, okay? Why should I trust you? You standing here mad at me is not going to save this land. You... let's go to your room (and) get your business plan. I have an idea! If you don't trust me, then trust God. Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on! Meghan, OMG! Where are you? We've been worried sick! Adam, I'm fine. Tell Whitaker nothing, okay? I can't just do that. Look, you fell off the face of the earth. We all have questions. Call jason and tell him that I am on my way bearing gifts. Okay, my friend? Yeah, okay. My car. Take it. It's yours. Jason, you told me that if I had a great opportunity, you wanted in. This is it. What is it? It's the future. I hope you have your check book. Hello. Mr. Whitaker, we can no longer wait. I thought you said the deal would be closed by today. Hoshi, relax. I gave you my word. You know how these lawyers work, Going over all that paperwork. It takes some time. I understand that, Mr. Whitaker, but we had a deal, and we agreed upon a deadline. - Yeah, but... - I'll wait for your call. All right, gather around, folks. we're gonna start the auction in about five minutes. Now, what you're gonna be bidding on is 1,000 acres of God's Country. Please, serious bidders only, Includes three nice trailers, lovely little log cabin, and a private lake. All right, we'll start the bidding at 75,000. Wait! - 1000 acres of... - No no no no! Wait! wait! Wait! I got it. I got the payment. Here you go. I'm with Whitaker & Associates and I hereby present to you the payment to restore the land into good standing. Everything seems to be in order. Sorry, folks, no auction today. Thanks. Meghan, I hope that smile is because Whitaker & Associates is closed on this land. No. We have a new partner. God's Country is gonna survive, so we can continue to save lives and give back. Do you think the world needs another casino to take people's money and destroy families? Why couldn't you build something that gives back to mankind? Meghan, you gotta be kidding me. No, I'm not, sir. After spending time here and seeing what this land was really about, I realized I could not be a part of building a casino out here. There are so many other pieces of land in this vast desert where the Yakamoto brothers can build their casino on. This little piece of land, this is too valuable, to this camp, to these people, And now me. You know what? You're fired. I know. Meghan, I trusted you to come up here and do the right thing! And you crossed me? I did do the right thing, and it took being up here at God's Country and this land to finally realize that. Now if you'll excuse me, we have a college to build. Man, I can not believe you got rid of that sweet ride! Listen, I'm gonna be in Los Angeles in a couple of weeks. Maybe I can come down there and we can hang out. Promise. Yes. Oh, stop it. I'm gonna go get the truck. All right. I'm really gonna miss you. I told you I want you to come hang out with me. Yeah, but you're just saying that now. Promise. You're special. Thank you. Meghan, we're truly gonna miss you. How did you know? I didn't. He did. You ready to go? I am. So, partner, you ready to take me back to the hustle and bustle of city life? You know you're always welcome to stay here. You can teach business finance at the college. Trust me. I'll be back to check on my new venture. especially since I'm officially unemployed. Yeah, well, I hope business isn't the only reason you come back. How about I buy you dinner? You know, I know a great sushi place. Hey, do you have any plans tomorrow? Why? What do you have in mind? Hello? Meghan! Oh. Well, I can't say I'm not disappointed. Well, I know that you're busy... Meghan, can you wait a second? There's someone at the door. Be right back. Ah! Yes? Hi. I have a delivery for a Ms. Emma Doherty. That's me. Great. These are for you. Oh, thank you. Have a great day. - You too. - Bye bye. Oh, Meghan. Okay, I'm back. I just received the flowers. How beautiful! Thank you. At least you didn't forget about me. Again? Please hold. Oh! Surprise! Oh, my God! Meghan! Oh, sweetheart! Happy birthday, mom. Oh! Thank you. Come in. Oh my God! Happy birthday! - You look beautiful! - Thank you! - This is Jake. - Hi, I'm Jake. Hi! Yeah, I know! Come in! Oh, sweetheart, I can't believe you did this! Hey, come on! I was so surprised! I just couldn't believe it. Oh. I actually got you a little something. Jake, thank you. That's very sweet of you. You're very welcome. Your daughter's very important to me in the little time I've known her. So... That's so sweet. Thank you. Yay! Cake! Oh, look at that! Happy birthday, mom! You think it's big enough? I'm so glad you're here. Oh! Hey, you mean the world to me. Thanks, sweetie. Okay, now blow out your candles. Okay. Ready? [music ends]
