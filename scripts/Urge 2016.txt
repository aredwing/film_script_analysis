Your original offer was, for lack of a better term, ridiculous, and this is even worse. Now Neil, you can't just grind and grind and grind until you get everything you want, changing the bid every time. There has to be some decency, now I suggest... Sorry, new toy. Can't keep my hands off it. Come here, look inside. Perfect scale. See that cigarette lighter? Functional. If you happen to smoke tiny cigarettes. I only mention this because I've got the real one about to land upstairs. By now my friends have just gotten to the roof. We're heading off to eastman island for the weekend, kind of a reunion. No offense, but could we... Move things the fuck along? Yo ho ho! - What?! - What?! What's up, dude! Oh my God, look who it is. Oh! So he's invited you two as well, huh? Yeah, what's that supposed to mean? - Nothing, come here. - How you doing, babe? I'm good, how are you? Good, good. - Hey! - Hey! Does anybody have any idea why we're up here? You can't just leave, Neil, you have to address the issues of this deal. Look Gerald, I'm gonna call you Jerry. Jerry, from where I'm sitting you don't seem happy, you seem downright stressed. Stressed would be an understatement. Wouldn't you agree that we have a massive problem here? No, I mean I could see that you may have a problem. The closest thing i have to a problem is whether or not i can get to the roof before my chopper touches down. I don't like to keep the rotors running. This is insane, this is not the way it's done, this is not the way I do business. Who the fuck cares how you do business? This isn't a negotiation, it's a fire sale, a fire that you and your pals here fucking started. So give up whatever best case scenario you walked in here with, take a deep breath, swallow hard, and accept your new reality. This deal is not going through. We both know you're only putting on this little show for your underlings. No offense. I really do have to get out of here. Great, well let's close this baby before you guys run out of money. It's not all about money, you know? You have to be able to apply your mind and your body. God, there's nothing worse than a self-righteous former fatty. Whoa, whoa, vick fat? No way! - Yeah, cheers for that. - What? I used to be a tad husky in college. Ha, husky? Yeah, whatever says 48 cargo short. Okay, you know what, go easy on my man because I'm gonna tell you right now your body's banging. - But yeah, you're good now. - Rock hard stomach. - What, have you finished? - All right, I'm done, I'm sorry. So what about Jason, is he coming as well? - No, uninvited. - What? The droid has put an end to Neil subsidizing Jason's rock star lifestyle. Who's the droid? Well now we have something to celebrate. Neil, I don't know, is it really necessary that I go this weekend? It has zero to do with work and I have zero desire to hang out with your friends. This weekend's gonna be epic. Epic as in I'll have to contend with Jason's antics all weekend? I did not even invite Jason. I knew that would make you happy. - You're not gonna give up. - No. Okay, well do not expect me to cut loose with your bridge and tunnel friends. There you go, that's the spirit. Sort of. - Oh, he's there, yeah? - That's him. Hello, my friends. Hello. Victor old boy. Looking a little doughy, did you stop working out? - Hey, babe. - Don't call me babe. You want me to take that? Entirely unnecessary. The droid, right? I get it. I told you this was a horrible idea. Anyway, now if you wanna ride back with me to the city, we gotta leave 6 am Monday morning 'cause i gotta be back to work. Otherwise, the only way off the island is the ferry and it's always a mob scene. You guys, I guarantee you all a weekend you will never forget. Are you kidding me?! Oh, of course Jason is already here having amazing looking sex. Bravo! You said he wasn't coming. Well, I said he wasn't invited, but you know Jason, he does what he wants. It's completely out of my control. Oh right, like you would put anything out of your control. Welcome to eastman island. God I'm happy to see you guys. You must be starving. This has probably got all dairy, right? Hey pastry face, can you give me a little room to grab some food, Vick and I, we gave up wheat and dairy and that literally changed our lives. We can do this. We just have to stay clear of temptation, all right? I for one am gonna be smashing it in the well appointed and completely unused gym that Neil probably has somewhere. Shit man, what, is it cheat day? Come on, you're only cheating yourself if you don't eat what you want. You know I hate when people flaunt abnormally good genetics. God I missed you idiots! Everyone put down their plate, I got one more surprise. Ready? Come with me, let's go. Especially you. Come on. Okay, stop. Okay, Neil, I wanted to show you how much I appreciate you being there for me all these years. I know you said that I should take my art seriously and go big. Well, I give you big. Wow. Yeah. Well that's going to affect the resale value. Probably won't get a dollar over 20 million for this dump. The struggle? I love it. It's killer. Thank you, brother. In fact, in honor of this, and you guys all being here, it's time to crack open the macallan. Neil, not the bottle from the auction. It's 62 years old. Exactly. What a better time than now to break it open. 62 year old macallan? That's gotta be pretty pricey I'd say. 65k? 75? 100? It's... - Jason. - Yeah. Did you by any chance get the inspiration to open my scarce and ridiculously expensive bottle of scotch? Dude, seriously, i had no idea. Who spends that much money on booze, right? That is scandalous, even for you. You are such an asshole. You did not mix macallan with coke. If you mixed $100,000's worth of the world's finest scotch with a can of coke, I can never ever know about it. Get your big eyes off my girl, you massive perv. What, oh. Did you save her family's life, grabbed them out of a burning building or something? She is so above your pay grade. Speaking of pay grade, are you still in that fixed income desk at merrill? You can't be far off, what, five figures now is it? All right, just so you guys know, this isn't gonna be another weekend where I play punching bag to a whole bunch of over-privileged one percenters. I was genuinely, as a friend, sincerely asking if her family was ever in danger and if their lives were at stake and you happened to be there to save them. Because you plus that girl makes zero sense. Why is that? 'Cause she's a nine foot tall beauty monster? You could all learn a lot from me boys, I know exactly how to handle a girl like that. Yeah, by playing off your British accent even though you moved here when you were 13. Never let them think they are doing you a favor. She'd never admit it, but she knows it. She loves it. I think you need to sign Danny up for your dating class, vick. Actually I'm off women right now. It's exhausting. Think about it, you obsess about meeting them. Then once you meet them, then you obsess about taking them out, and then once you take them out, then you start obsessing about having sex with them. Then once you get them into bed, that's when you start obsessing about other women. I don't have time for that. Stop obsessing, drains the moment. give up what you want is the moment you find what you're looking for. Oh my friend, if only that advice worked in the real world. We'd all be oversexed and under-stressed like you. Granted, no skyscrapers would've ever been built. There'd be no velcro. Children would still be dying of polio. So what, the world doesn't need dreamers? Yeah, dreaming's great, but doing is the only thing that matters. I'm talking about accomplishment. Being able to say i did that or I own that. Why? To impress women. Man's unrequited desire to sleep with beautiful women is a linchpin of a thriving society. Have you put your linchpin in the droid yet? You know me. So you two are... together? That part's complicated. You guys get that. We love you, but Sigmund Freud on an ounce of coke couldn't understand you and the droid. Hey, what are you doing? Putting my stuff away. I don't want anything to wrinkle. Could you at least stay in my room? Please don't start. You know that's not happening. - I just thought... - what did you think? I work for you. How would it look if i were to stay in your room? It would look a lot better than if you didn't. Yeah, for you. Theresa, they know I'm crazy about you, okay? They just don't know about our arrangement. Oh my God, do not say "arrangement." I'm am not a geisha! I'm sorry, I have a very large bed, I will stay on my side, you stay on yours. I will be a very good boy, I promise. Please. Fine. We will share a bed. happy? Yes, I am fucking ecstatic. Great. I'll take care of your stuff. I'd like you to go up and get a drink and try to pretend that you don't hate everyone. - Fine. - Thank you. - Do not... - wrinkle anything. I know. Wow, a line huh? Eastman finally got a civilized club. Hey, we'd like two tables please. Is there a vip hostess or somebody we can talk to? No there's not. "No there's not", okay. Neil, Neil, Neil! Is this guy kidding me? Yeah, good talking, good talking. All right, hey brother. Sorry about my friend, he's a little rough around the edges. New money? Yeah, super new. All right, look, there's rules okay? If you get chosen, you can have anything you want. Are they serious? All right. Thank you, brother. You don't call me brother. Whoa, this place is... This place is awesome. We'd like two tables please. Are you sure you're ready for all this? Yes, I believe we are. Do you have any? Any what? Any coke? I can get you so much coke. What just happened? Will you have me? This is crazy, what is everyone on, ecstasy? K, special k? Mdma? Same thing actually ain't they? My God you're an old man. We are going to get into so much trouble tonight. I have a feeling that tonight is going to be epic. Oh, this is really something! This is all too much. Hello, little ones. Hello. Yes, it's that kind of show. We speechless? Bewildered, overwhelmed? Oh how I look forward to falling in love with you, staring deeply into your eyes. I can't wait to show our secrets. Our hopes and dreams and then blissfully die in your arms. But all that will have to wait. We just have too much to show you. So much, so much. Now I know you are not ready for this, but I know she is very ready for all of you. Let me introduce you to our very own angel, xiomara! I mean okay. You guys, I'm turned on and freaked out at the same time, but please tell me we're doing whatever it is everybody else here is on. Oh, baby, I assure you, we're gonna make this happen. Do we really wanna do this? Yes, we are so doing this. I don't know if it's Molly or mushrooms or fucking pharmaceutical rhino horn, this is happening. You, come with me. - Me? - Now. Come, don't come, I don't care. Hey, go, go! Oh, I'm going alone. I mean what else is new. All right, lead the way, take me to the lion's den. Bring me something 100 years old this time. You are going to be introduced to the man. Oh, you mean the drug dealer. Please, try not to be so exhausting. Here's the deal, you're meeting the man, show respect, get respect, got it? So do I pay you the money, or... what did I just say? You aren't even inside yet, you're already being a pain in the ass. Don't say anything stupid. - Yup, okay, got it, got it. - Got it? Welcome, Jason. We've been expecting you. So what are we thinking, Jason? What are we thinking? I can tell you what i was thinking. I was thinking about scoring some party favors. Now I'm not so sure. Tell me what you think you know. Well, honestly, everyone out there's partying like it's the end of the world, so I assume mghb, dmt, mollies, and pharmaceutical cocaine or some combo of all that. Exactly, it's nothing like that. Well what I think you're looking for is something they call urge and it's new and from what I hear it's very... ...very different. Could you be more obscure? Imagine a key that unlocks that which is most hidden. Uninhibited by modern anxieties. Imagine being truly you. For just one moment. A perfect creation. Wow, you can be more obscure. You are so irreverent. No wonder the local girls from town are smitten with you. Oh, my dear boy, you will find out that I know quite a lot. Look, can I get the stuff from you or not? Please, Jason, please don't be so common. Come now, you are better than that. Have you ever noticed how different you are from all your other friends? Have you ever noticed how the worst part of buying drugs is having to listen to dealers who think they're fascinating? Look man, I'm just here to have a good time. A good time. Now there's a concept. Listen, it's not that I'm not enjoying this. It's that I'm really not enjoying this. To be the libertine. The artist, speaking of which, did you ever tell your friend, Neal, that you hired local talent for the mural? What? Look man, I stenciled everything, I just... shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, easy breasy. It's just gonna be our little secret. Between you and me. Know what Norman mailer said, hmm? "Good artists copy, great artists steal." Hey, man, that's my work. Of course it is. And what do you think I do here at volcano, I create, i delegate, I make things happen. The stage show, the experience. All of it. It's my art. It sounds like a dream. In dreams begin responsibilities. Delmore Schwartz. Wow, I can't believe i got a dealer who quotes delmore Schwartz. Spectacular. We'll talk again soon. Wait, really, that's it? You're not gonna sell me the stuff? Oh, I never was. The red bastard will see you out. Can you snap the brink? You've been puffed? Had your pill pricked? - Have you done urge? - No. Okay, that is the right answer. Watch and learn. Urge. Makes you feel so wonderful you think you're gonna die. And afraid you won't. I think we're just looking to get high. "High." High is old paradigm. Urge is way beyond that. So, are you ready? Where? Here? Now? Give me your face. A good old fashioned rush. - I don't feel anything. - What? Nada, I mean... that's rare. Maybe a little trippy at first, but... - You really feel nothing? - Nah, nothing. Give it awhile, I'm sure it'll kick in. There is one more thing we have to discuss. We need to discuss the rule. - Rules? - Not rules, rule. There's only one. But it's a doozy. Supposedly it blows the doors off of anything you've done before. There's no hangover and it's perfect, but you only have one shot. You can only do it once. Wait, you mean once tonight. No, no, no, like once ever. That doesn't make any sense, I've never heard of any shit like that before. That's stupid. Jesus, Joey, can you spell addict? We haven't even tried it yet! It sounds kinda sketch. I tried it. - What? - And? You guys try it and tell me. I don't think it's really kicked in yet, but it's supposed to be some next level shit. Yeah? So who told you this one time rule? I mean... You know, something tells me not everyone's following that rule. You guys do what you want. I'm just telling you what they told me. Guys, this conversation is great and all, but we all know we're doing it, so if you will. - Okay, let me show you. - Please do. I get it now. Fuck yes! Took you guys long enough. She is everything. I'm here. My God, I can't believe the way I feel, I've never felt like this before. Yeah. Have you seen me dance? Did you see me dance? I was like really fucking dancing. Not like white guy dancing, but dancing for real. It's like a piece of self in my body, it just feels like it's in the right place, it's like I'm fucking hallucinating reality. Reality's perfect, reality's perfect. I'm glad that you reached nirvana 'cause I don't feel shit. - What? - What a crazy fucking night. I'm in heaven. God, I feel amazing. Hey, hey, he's not feeling anything. - I don't... - what?! How? How is that possible? This guy is not affected by urge. When you're pure ID, you don't need to shake your superego. Let's not forget I'm a philistine please. When you're not on a leash, you don't feel anything when you're off one, it's just business as usual. I don't know about that. I think so. You lucky fucker. So you feel like this all the time? Like... None of this weight on your chest? Because I could get used to that. Maybe we've all been wrong about you, Jason. You may simply be more enlightened than we are. Oh, come on. - Oh, okay. - Whoa! Okay, so Jason's the ascended master. Oh, no, no, guys, I just think i need a bigger dose. No, baby. You're the only man here who doesn't need a dose at all. Now can we get back to having the best fucking night ever?! All right, I'm bringing it up. Hey, all right, you two fucking on the dance floor last night? I'm sorry, I guess i was just raised a little differently than you sluts. No, no, we didn't. Yeah, you did. And you did hard. Real hard. - Mmm-hm. - Mmm-hm. Yeah, well I guess i never realized how much I like an audience before. I guess I never really realized how much I like being in an audience. Oi! Show some respect. I respect everything you guys did last night. You're not funny. Come on, relax. We had such fun last night right? I mean what kind of a club allows you to do that in front of everybody? I mean who condones that type of behavior? Party still raging. - Woo! - Yeah! Oh, Jason, last night that girl I was with asked me to give her a shaved bat? Ew! I don't know what that is, is that awesome or is that disgusting? A, I have no idea what a shaved bat is, and b, if you're involved it probably is disgusting. - Oh, hello. - Hey! Neil wanted me to give these to you. - What?! - How nice. Good morning, little babies. - Good morning! - Hello! Believe it or not, today is going to be even better than yesterday, and yesterday was fucking epic. Understatement. Now you all have today's agenda on your iPads. We are going to begin with deep tissue thai massage. After that you have a choice. Tennis lessons with Pete Sampras, he's a friend. He won wimbledon, no big deal. If you're not into that, scuba lessons off the shore, or private yoga sessions with this famous yogi that Theresa found on TV. He's ours for the weekend, everything's taken care of. Whatever you choose will be amazing. Trust me. Easy, control freak. After that I have glam squads coming for the ladies. Gentlemen, steam baths at the local Russian joint. I bought the whole place out so we don't have to stare at any sad old man balls. Ooh, sadder and older than yours? Wow. Oh my God, i might have to marry you. Charming. Tonight, dinner at acadia. Chef's table inside the kitchen. Ten course meal with wine pairing. It's going to blow your fucking minds. That sounds amazing. What? What is it, are you guys not feeling this because everything's taken care of. Whatever you want. Guys, I even had dj z-trip make you all personal relaxation mixes. Really? Yeah, maybe that was a little overboard huh? So... It's just that... We all had a really great time last night. It was like the best night ever. I don't wanna sound like a dick about it, but the only thing that i actually wanna do, the only thing I'm thinking about is... Dude, we just wanna urge out! We can only do it once, and yeah, we had our shot at it, and it was as advertised. Perfection. Come on, what's the issue? Why can't we do it twice? I wouldn't mind doing it again. Great! We're taking urge hitting everything in the agenda! Hold on, hey, wait, wait. Obviously it didn't work on me, so you guys go ahead, have fun, but I'm out. - Have fun. - Oh, come on! You are so doing more urge, Jay. Come on! Yes you are. You guys are gonna be the death of me. Look who's uptight now. Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a beautiful day, but it's now time for the main event. Finally. I have to be honest. I'm a little nervous. - Aw, let's just do it. - Yeah. Jason? Bottoms up, bitches. Oh, bravo, bravo. Who the fuck are you? You just staring at me? No, we're not the only ones. Neil's gonna be pissed. Jason! Hey, Joey, hey! You're awake! - What is this? - What do you mean? What, you don't remember? Seriously? We went back to volcano and it got weird. Got real freakin' weird, and then at the end of the night, Neil basically invited the entire club back to the place and... Who was that? Danny, he's been up to that all night. Yeah, well of course it's Danny. God, I would love to murder him. Sorry, can't believe i just said that. Jay, why has nothing ever happened between us? Why have we never hooked up? What? No, don't answer that, don't answer that. I already know the answer, okay? It's because I'm not like one of your dazzly, glittery, sparkly girly girls. I wasn't born that way. Why don't you just go find Danny before he kills himself or somebody else or us, I don't know, I'm starving! Fuck... Oh, my fucking God. You should see your stupid fucking face! Hey, Jay! You don't look like you're having fun. Don't tell me you gave up on fun! Oh, shit! Urge! The first time, amazing. The second time, it just hits you so hard! And then the third time is just... Oh, and the fourth! Fucking paradise. Why aren't people fucking in here?! When was the last time we ate? Really, how long has it been, right? Get up. It's over. What are you talking about? I'm over this. You're out of my system. It was fun. I see things clearly now. What is that supposed to mean? You're a bad person, Theresa. You use me. You use my insecurities against me. You make me believe that I have all the power, but we both know it's always been you. Not anymore. And guess what? I can't believe that I ever let you think that your beauty was equal to my talents. I'm fucking brilliant and you're a quickly aging six. Maybe six and a half. You're what we would call a rapidly depreciating asset. I don't ever wanna see you again. Where the fuck have you been? I got so fucking hammered last night, I don't remember anything. Yeah, you disappeared after we hit the volcano. Danny said he saw you talk with some guy in a $10,000 suit although I don't think Danny would know what a $10,000 suit looks like. Neil, your house, there's so many people. You want me to kick them out? Are you kidding? I fucking love this, the entire island has been through here tonight. You know what your problem is? You just need to take more urge. Go ahead. Take more, do it. You really think that's a good idea? I wasn't asking. You don't understand why you're here? Do you not get it? - What? - I mean you're the Jester. - I'm a what? - A Jester, like a... Like an organ grinder monkey. When I want my monkey to dance, he better fucking dance! - Are you okay man? - I'm fucking amazing. I'm on top of the fucking world, Jay. What's happening tonight? I'm scrubbing off the barnacles. You know what, you're right. You're 100 percent right. I'm out of here. Enjoy your party. Jason, wait! Maybe six and a half is a little harsh. The hell are you doing? I am stealing this guy's shit because he's not gonna notice. Sounds about right. Hi beautiful. What are you doing? You know you are. What's wrong? God, you're so beautiful. Your body. You're stunning. I'm disgusting, I just fucked a cake for Christ's sake. Come on, you are just amazing. Stop it! It's okay. Urge, right? I mean look at you. You're stunning. No. So what? What was all that about? What the fuck? I guess some people can't handle their urge. But I can. Baby, no. No, no, I've got nothing left in the tank all right, I can't do it again. Come into the pool. I'm done. I'll tell you when you're done. Oh, it's gonna be a long night. I hope you're up for it. ...i just wanna tell her to lay off the... And who shops at kohl's? Oh, I look so good. giving out blowjobs like they're handshakes. Stupid cunt. Oh, my God! You cunts are what's wrong with the world! Oh, my God! Okay, so next round, double the odds and we're not gonna stop until somebody stops breathing. You look so confused, Neil. Why are you confused? Oooh. Oh, when you followed me in here like a little puppy, you thought you were gonna get all of this, huh? You probably thought you were gonna get some kind of marathon fuck session, didn't you? God, I cannot believe what a predictable neanderthal you are, Neal. So let me get this straight. I throw on some lingerie and you forget all about your little speech about how I was pure evil. I had you by the balls every second of every day, you would have given up your entire fortune for one night with me. Yet somehow you still thought that you owned me. Oh, fuck. No, no, no, no. No, ah, baby, baby, I'm really sore, come on. Shhh, I thought you loved me. I'm really hurting. Oh, no, no, no, no. Babe, you gotta stop, stop, stop. - Ow! - Choke me. - What? - You gotta choke me. Come on, fucking choke me. Just do it. No, no, I don't... yes, yes! Fucking do it! Don't fucking stop you fat piece of shit. - Fucking choke me! - Don't fucking say that. Fucking choke me! Yeah, like that. You fat piece of shit! Fucking... You fucking fat slob! Fuck yeah! You're a fucking disgusting... Do you really fucking like that? Look at me! Fuck! Come on! Fuck, fuck! Woo! Wooooo! Oh, fuck. Fuck. Oh, baby, that was fucking awesome. For the first time in your life, tonight... You will not win. Do you know what time the next ferry starts running? Oh, hun, I'm sorry, it doesn't start running 'till 10 on the weekends. There's a booth in the back if you wanna sit with the crazies. Yeah. All right, I'll bet you 10 bucks they're gonna puke before we do. - No, I'm not betting, quit it. - Come on, it's 10 bucks. I'll give you odds, two to one. I'm not betting. Come on, don't be a bitch. Dude, relax, all day with this bullshit. You're gonna fucking punch me right in the face. Yeah, I will punch you in the face. I can't take it, stop it. May I join you? Knock yourself out. Thank you so much. You ever read the good book, Jason? The good book? Mmm. If you had read the good book you'd know that God created man in his own image. What they don't tell you is the copy is nowhere close to the original. One can only conclude that people are simply... ...abysmal. Don't you agree? On this island, yeah, you might be onto something. No, not just on this island. Look at history. Man's inhumanity to man proves that the very nature of mankind is defective. Wow, I forgot how chatty you were. Look, I'm really not the guy that you're looking for, and I don't spend a lot of time nodding on dialectics, I'm more about the here and now. Ah. And how are things here? - Now? - Pretty fucked up. Which is why I'm getting off the island. Like the song says. Where you gonna run to? You can't escape the fact that mankind is tethered to a vicious cycle of creation, decay, and destruction. Rinse and repeat. Look, man, I think your little science project's wrecking havoc on the island here. I can't be responsible for people who indulge and don't follow the singular rule they've been given. Nothing to do with me, i wash my hands of that. As Milton said, mind is its own place. And in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven. - So what? - So urge is both. It's like a magic key to the soul for whoever... I mean have you seen the way that people are acting around here? It's bizarre. Once we lose our inhibitions, we don't remember why we had them, I mean look around you. Life still goes on, does it not? Yes, but ever since my friends took that shit you gave them at the club, they've been acting out these personal orgasmic catastrophes, i mean they've been... saying things they've never said before. Doing things you'd never expect them to do. Yeah. Something like that. Jenny, stop it. Punch me in my fucking face! Now you owe me 20 bucks! Don't touch my baby! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey, you all right? You all right, you all right? Don't just stand there, we gotta get this guy to a hospital! Hello, gorgeous. How can I help you? I don't really know. I was just kinda walking by. Well, you're just in time. My last appointment is a no show. How about a facial? Come, come sit, beautiful. You think I'm beautiful? Of course you're beautiful. I'll be right back. Oh, there you are. I have an appointment and I need my injections. I'm sorry, but I have a client and she was here first. Did she have an appointment? - You were late. - Are you kidding? Lupe, I have put your kids through college. What are you saying? Let's go! Let me just go sterilize. You know, the one thing your people have is not one wrinkle on that colored skin of yours. Who doesn't honor an appointment? - Honestly. - You're in really bad shape. You know, I need all the help I can get. Oh, shit! What did she do to me?! Come on, you fat fuck! You can do it! Oh, boy. Your perfect little weekend... Didn't end up so perfect, huh hotshot? I should save you from your misery of being you. While I'm at it, I should definitely take this. Oh, please keep crying. I can't tell you what it does to me. You have deserved this for a long time. You're totally right, i deserve this. I deserve this. I deserve this, please do it. Please do it. Just do it! Please... Please! You can't even do this right. Please, Theresa, please. You are such a worthless piece of shit! ...fucking loved me! Instead you stick your little fucking nose in here. - I don't fucking care. - You are a coward. Why don't you take my money? It's all yours. No. And why don't you just finish this? Just finish it, I'm fucking telling you to fucking finish it today. I am done giving you what you want. You can finish this. I need you to finish this, please. I need you to finish this right now. Do it, do it! Theresa, where are you going?! Finish this! Finish this! Theresa, kill me! Finish this! Please, please. All right, all right. All right, you're gonna be okay. Holy... Joey! Joey, are you okay?! Jason, what are you doing here?! - Are you hurt? - No, I'm okay. I brought this lady in here who got jacked up, man, look at all these people, something is happening. No, no, no, i noticed, I noticed. What happened to you, are you... excuse me! No, no, no, it's not my blood. - It's not my blood. - Oh, it's not your blood, oh, that makes all the difference in the world. My bad, I'm sorry, sit down! Guy got hit by a truck and I brought him in. Jesus, it's not even a full moon. That guy was shot in the forehead with a nail gun by his brother-in-law, you know why? Neither does he. This guy had to have his stomach pumped, his wife brought him in, said he couldn't stop drinking lysol. Lysol, that's not a beverage. This lady over here, we had to handcuff her into the chair she's sitting in, you know why? 'Cause she couldn't get clean enough. Her boyfriend found her in a tub full of bleach scrubbing herself with brillo pads. - Urge. - What? I think it might have something to do with a drug everyone's taking. Oh, for sure it's the drugs. There's no way good Americans would act this way sober. You city people, you come to eastman and you treat it like sodom and gomorrah and you don't expect a wrath of God? My advice to you is to get off the island now. Yeah, no, I wish. About an hour ago I would've, but I gotta get my friends off the island. Are they adults? Fuck your friends, listen, your best bet is to get up on outta here, go to the ship... Wow. I always wanted to do that. Here, hold this. What do we do? Obviously I have no idea. Joey? Joey! Go. Joey, go! Find the girls. Oh, fuck, Neil! What the fuck is going on?! Hey, hey, hey, Neil, Neil, Neil! You all right, you're all right. What the fuck happened, who did this to you? - It's not her fault. - Whose fault? Don't blame her. Okay, okay, I'm gonna get you the fuck off this island. Denise is dead, I can't find vick anywhere, - we gotta get you... - don't untie me. - Neil, let go! - Please don't untie me. - Neil... - don't untie... ow! Don't untie me! Get you off this island, buddy, come on. We can do this. Neil, Neil, no! No, fuck! All operators are assisting other callers, we're sorry, we know this is an emergency, 911, what's your emergency? Oh, thank God, thank God, thank you. I need an ambulance, my friend, he killed himself... He took this drug, everyone's taking this drug. Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, you're not listening to me, there's something happening in this town... sir, shut the fuck up! Excuse me? God, you people are so fucking boring! You know, I'm glad the whole town is eating itself alive! I just wish people would get off the island and stop bothering me so I can get back to my sudoku! - Jason?! - Joey, don't come in here! Joey, Joey! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Jesus, holy shit! What the fuck, Jason, what happened?! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, we're all gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay. they're dead too, all our fucking friends are dead as can get! Okay, listen, listen, I know. Listen, we're gonna go down to the ferry, I'm sure that everyone's heading there to get off the island. Why the ferry? Because getting to the ferry's our only hope. - Shit! - Talk too much! Oh, my God. Come here. What the... oh, Jason! We can't go back that way. I just tried to get to the ferry and they are animals, all of them! For what you did to Neil, you deserve worse than what they would doing to do! Jason, stop it! You have no idea what's going on. You have no idea what you are talking about! Neil deserved everything that he got, okay? You know how it feels. He always had the upper hand, he always had control over me and I wanted control, i wanted to win just once! You won, he's dead! He killed himself, Theresa. What? Jason, we don't have time to turn on each other. We have to go find Danny, come on! You can't take the beach, guys. Theresa. If you go that way, we die. The beach, it's worse. Theresa, please come. Come on! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Jason! Joey, come on! Oh, fuck, guys! Oh, my God. Oh, no. Hey, hey! Hey, let them go, let them go! Look, man, we're just trying to get off this island. Therein lies the rub. Danny. You guys don't get it. You wanna leave here? What are you going back to? It's perfect here. No more pretending, no more lies. We can be free. Why would you wanna leave paradise? Danny, we're your friends! Why are you doing this to us?! Oh, wait, you're my friends, is that why you guys always treat me like a dickless clown? Why I'm always the butt of your fucking jokes? Danny, it's us, let us go! - This place... - this place is magical! I am the Neo here! Can't you see?! You don't know me. You guys know the old me. The scared me. The me who gave a fuck what you thought! This is the real me! The king of the motherfucking beach! Come on, Danny, let's stop it! I mean look around, look what's happening! People are dying! Your friends are dead! I can't tell you how happy I am to never be jealous of you again. Stop! Danny, you're turned into a monster! Jason, when you've got a chance take Joey and run! Oh, wait, shit. Shh, shh, shh. You guys having a little chitchat over here? Theresa, why don't you share with everybody. I was just saying... You're the king of this beach, but where's your queen? What is a king without a queen, right? My God, you're right, i need a queen! Will you be my queen? Just like that, will you be my queen?! You know, I never realized what you were capable of. And now you see me. You can see me! And you still think that you can control me like you controlled Neil? Oh, you're getting me fucking hard! Oh, that's funny. See, I always knew you had a thing for me. Everyone did, but I didn't give a shit because you were invisible on my radar. Compared to Neil, you're nothing, he was a giant. It's a new Danny. String her up! Don't do this, man! Jason, you're next. Oh, my God, I feel so dumb! Before you go, there's something that I've been meaning to give you. Danny, no! No! No, you can't! No! My God, stop it, Danny! No! Danny, stop it! Theresa, no! Danny! Danny! You're all animals! Woo! It's too late, run! Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go! Go, go, go. Wait, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave! Gotta take off. Hey. - You okay? - Where is he? Hey, why don't you have a seat? You know who. The man. Listen man, i know that he's here! Sit down and relax, just have a seat right... hey, hey! Oh, hello, Jason. Where is he? - Who? - Where is he? Who? I'll take it from here, captain. Well, you certainly know how to make an entrance. You're gonna tell me what the fuck's going on! Jason, I know it's hard for you to understand, but trust me, you cannot grasp the totality of this grand design. What you witnessed was the dawn of something as necessary as it is devastating. No, I don't understand why you wanna kill every man, woman, and child on this island. That was none of my doing. You know damn well that shit you sold everyone's wreaking havoc on that island! Jason, Jason, i didn't sell anything. All urge did was lift up the rock. What you saw was the wickedness and evil that laid beneath it. So you're playing God? Spiting the wicked? Wrong on both accounts. I am not pretending. And I am not the one who will do the smiting, Jason, it will be you. You have lived your whole life as the son of a scoundrel and a whore. Without the slightest notion of any meaning in this world. You have no roots. You go from place to place, from woman to woman. Never allow yourself to succumb to the lure of stability. Why is that? Because you know there is no such thing. Nothing, it is a fallacy. Normality? Stability? It's a construct, a fantasy, you see through that. You see the truth. How do you know all this? I know all. I see all. Yet... I didn't expect to find you. The anomalies of my creations are always so fascinating. Jason, you will stand beside me and you will help me cleanse this world and return it to perfection. You will take urge to the city and then you will take it to the world! This is insanity. You need proof? You need context? I completely get where you're coming from. You cannot stop that which has no beginning and no end. Mankind can be such a disappointment. Please trust that they have nothing to give you. I, I can give you immortality. I'd rather have my humanity. You wanna see the future of your beloved humanity?! Walk with me. And you never will look back at this decrepit world. Do you like mushrooms? Let me see if they have mushrooms. - Don't go too far! - Yes, mom! Billy! Billy! Mom?
