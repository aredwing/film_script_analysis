Martin always made the arrangements|with the nursery. After his death, the service|just automatically continued. Not that I haven't the time. With|the children away except for weekends, - I've got nothing but time.|- Yes, I know. That's enough about that.|Let's have our lunch. It's all ready. - Darling, I can't have lunch.|- Oh? I would have phoned, but I wanted|to bring back the dishes I borrowed. Sometimes I think you're smart|not to be a club woman. Sometimes I wonder,|but it's just not for me. - I hope you didn't go to trouble.|- I didn't. It's George. He just phoned.|He's bringing out a weekend guest. Last-minute notice, as usual. What with a hundred other things to do,|I've got to dig up a date tonight... - For this Mr. Allenby.|- A date? Look, he's 40, which means he'll|consider any female over 18 too old. We might as well face it.|I've got to be off. Oh, how about joining us tonight|at the club for dinner? Well, no, Sara,|I don't think I'd better. Don't be silly. I'll phone Harvey.|Pick you up around 7:30. - Harvey?|- Oh, well, at least he's available. - Bye, darling.|- Good-bye. Engine Starting] - Could I help you, Mrs. Scott?|- Well, yes, thank you. - Just put it right there.|- All right. - Would you like some hot coffee?|- Yeah, thanks. Perhaps you'd like|to share my lunch with me. My friend couldn't stay. I have plenty|of food. Chicken, salad and rolls. - Just a roll and some coffee will do.|- All right. - Won't you sit down?|- Mm-hmm. I was just wondering|if there's much to be done. - Everything looks so wonderful.|- Not much. [Chuckles] Do you think you'll finish today|or will you have to come back? Well, probably will. I often wish I knew more|about gardening. Do you think|I ought to take it up? Only if you think|you'd like it. - I'm Mrs. Scott.|- Yes, I know. - I'm Ron Kirby.|- Oh, you're Mr. Kirby's son. Mm-hmm. I took over the nursery|three years ago when my father died. Have you been coming here|ever since? Mm-hmm. Every spring and every autumn. This may be my last year. At agricultural school, I got interested|in trees. So I started growing them. - What kind of trees?|- All kinds. White fir, Douglas fir,|silver tip spruce. - Do I have any?|- [Chuckles] No. But you have some|just as interesting. Like this Koelreuteria. In china where it comes from,|they call it the Golden Rain tree. Beautiful, isn't it? They say it can only thrive|near a home where there's love. - It's a beautiful legend.|- Mm-hmm. Well, I'd better|get back to work. Thank you for the coffee. [Boy] Hey, Mother! Here I am! Hello, darling!|- Hi! - Ned|- Hi, mom. I didn't expect you home|until tomorrow. I didn't have a class today|so I phoned Kay from Princeton... I was catching up on some case|histories... bane of the social worker... - So I brought them along.|- When's dinner? I've been invited out|for dinner. - Where are you going?|- Sarah's giving a party at the club. I'll have to get dressed. Harvey's|going to pick me up in a little while. Harvey? Oh, that's all right.|I'll go fix the cocktails. - Harvey likes my martinis.|- Ned, the martini wizard. Have you been seeing much of Harvey?|- No, dear, he's been out of town. Florida, I think.|- I like Harvey. He's pleasant, amusing,|and he acts his age. If there's anything I can't stand,|it's an old goat. As Freud says, when we reach|a certain age, sex becomes incongruous. I think Harvey understands that. ##[Orchestra] And the only bachelor|around here. I'll admit,|he does have his drawbacks. He talks too much|about his health, but when you get to be his age,|it's understandable. Of course, it's normal to|fall apart as one grows older. But I can see|it might be hard to accept. Although naturally it doesn't matter|as much with men as it does with women. But, I guess Harvey's|intelligent enough anyway to... this? [Wolf Whistle] It's about time you wore something|besides that old black velvet. - Is it?|- Of course. Personally, I never subscribed|to that old Egyptian custom. At least I think it was Egypt.|- What egyptian custom? Of walling up the widow alive in the|funeral chamber of her dead husband... along with|his other possessions. The theory being that|she was a possession too. with him. The community saw to it. Of course, that doesn't happen anymore.|- Doesn't it? Well, perhaps not in Egypt. - What do you mean?|- Oh, nothing. Let's go downstairs. [Music Off] Holy cats, Mother. I've had it for quite a while.|I just haven't worn it. - Do you like it?|- I guess it's all right. [Doorbell Ringing] Hope it doesn't|scare Harvey off. - A typical Oedipus reaction.|- A what? A son subconsciously resents his|mother being attractive to other men. We call it an Oedipus complex. [Door Closes] - Good evening, Harvey.|- Cary, my dear! Well! - And Kay!|- Hi, Harvey. - You'll have a cocktail before you go?|- We have time. - He's mixed it especially for you.|- Thank you. - We've missed you.|- I'm glad. - Did you enjoy Florida?|- Perfect, Kay, perfect. Cary! I discovered one of the most|wonderful doctors down there. Cured one of my eternal colds,|like that! Mom, Harvey, the Scott special.|- Thank you, Ned. - Thank you.|- Mmm! Excellent, my boy! Excellent! I'm not sure the gin is as good|as the brand I usually use, but the vermouth is fair. [Kay] You mean|those two little drops you put in? Kay, I hope for the sake|of my liver you've miscounted. [Chuckling] Cary, you're looking|lovely tonight. - That color becomes you.|Well, thank you, Harvey. Ned was afraid the dress|might frighten you. It would take more...|perhaps I should say, less to scare me. No, thank you, Ned.|One cocktail is my limit. You know,|my reform started... the night your father|won this trophy. He filled it with champagne|and made us drink it. [Sighing]|I can still remember it. - How many of you were there?|- Not enough. - I think we better start, don't you?|- Yes, Harvey. ##[Orchestra] - Cary! Hi, Harvey.|- Hello, Bill. - We never see you anymore.|- Cary, dear, it's been ages. Ann and I were laughing|the other night about the time Martin... Here you are. You can have her later.|Come on, darling. My favorite woman. What'll it be? - We had a martini at the house...|- Never switch the pitch. - Same for you?|- Nothing for me. I've had my quota. You'll need more than one to see you|through this party, all my fault too. - And I've got him for the whole weekend.|- George! Hush. Tom, Cary. I want you to meet|Miss Frisbee, Mr. Allenby, Mrs. Scott. - Mrs. Scott.|- How do you do? Hello. I've been telling|your Mr. Allenby... He's awfully hard to resist. Seems to be mutual. - Sara!|- Hello, Sara, Cary. Did you see? The Nortons|are here together. After all the talk... - What talk?|- You know what everyone said. - No, but i'm sure you do.|- [Clearing Throat] Cary, oh, darling! How wonderful|to see you. I hardly recognized her. It's indecent to have two grown|children and look as young as you do. attracting attention, is there? I suppose that's why so few widows wear|it. They'd have to be so careful. - Hello, Howard.|- Hi! [Sara] Go ahead, Cary. All right. I'd like to. That was a horrid thing to say, Mona. What do you mean? I was only trying to cheer her up|by telling her how lovely she looked. - But she didn't seem to need it.|- Shall we have a drink? - How are mary and the children?|- Everybody's down with the flu. - I'm sorry.|- House is like a hospital. Now i'm glad I did.|[Chuckles] You're beautiful, Cary.|Too beautiful to be lonely. I can never decide whether Howard's|wife is a saint or just not very bright. She stays at home alone|night after night. - Yes, but she has the children.|- Even if she hasn't got Howard? - What does that mean?|- Don't bristle. Did I mention cary? I'm beginning to think|you have an evil mind. Now, really. - It's much nicer out here, isn't it?|- Yes. That's where they're going|to build a new swimming pool. - Oh? That's a wonderful place for it. When do you think they'll... Why don't we meet in new york?|I know a place. Howard, let's forget|you said that. I'm sorry, Cary.|I don't know what got into me. I know you're not like that.|I apologize for what I said. That's all right, Howard. - But I don't apologize for wanting you.|- [Sighs] Why didn't Ned tell me|about you before? Think of all the time|we've wasted. You're off on a tangent.|Your values are confused. I don't get it. The basic values of the sex attraction|between man and woman are... Oh, Mother and Harvey. Well, i'll try to explain,|but not here. Here you are. - Would you like a nightcap?|- No, thank you, Cary. It's way past my bedtime.|It's been a wild night for me. I've enjoyed every minute of it.|I always enjoy being with you. Thank you.|I feel the same. - Have your key?|- Yes. Now do you understand that much? Frankly, no. But... All right, I'll...|I'll try again. Cary...|[Nervous Chuckle] I don't know whether you're ready|to think about marrying again. Well, no, l...|I don't think I'm ready. Of course I realize I'm not|very romantic or impetuous... But then, you'd hardly|want that sort of thing. I'm sure you feel as I do. That companionship and affection|are the important things. I could give you those, Cary. Well, I won't press you|for a decision now. - Good night, dear.|- Good night, Harvey. You really didn't want to be|a football captain. You wanted love. - Yes.|- No, not the romantic nonsense. I mean, basic love,|the desire to be liked. Football was merely|a means to the end. Of course,|you do have the build for it. How can anyone so little|be so smart? And yet so pretty? [Sawing Sound] - I'll see you Tuesday.|- Well, how long does this go on? Oh, you mean the pruning. He was supposed to come back|a couple of weeks ago and finish up. - I almost gave him up for lost.|- The independent type, huh? - Good-bye, darling.|- Good-bye, Sara. Hello there. [Engine Starting]|- Hello. I thought you deserted us. - I've had a busy week.|- Busy two weeks. - Have you been buying more trees?|- How did you guess? Well, l... I was just going to make|some fresh coffee. - Would you like some?|- No, thank you. I'm all finished. That means we're not going|to see you again until next spring. I won't be coming back|next spring. I'm giving up|my maintenance work. Growing trees|is a full-time job. At least the way|I want to do it. Don't worry.|I'll find you someone. Thank you. Well, I guess this is good-bye.|I wish you luck with your trees. - Remember the silver tip spruce?|- Yes? I was wondering,|if you're not too busy, you might like to come over|to my place and see them. Well, I'm sorry,|but I'm afraid I can't today. Oh, well, of course,|if you can't. - Oh, Mr. Kirby.|- Yes, Mrs. Scott? Well, I was just thinking|that maybe if... You've changed your mind? All right! Let's go! It certainly is|out in the woods. - Not what you expected?|- I thought you lived here. I do. I can see that a woman might not|like it, but it does very well for me. If one likes to live|in a glass house. At night when I'm in bed|I can see the stars in the sky. - And you have your plants.|- Mm-hmm. - What a lovely color.|- That's a coleus. The one on the other side|is a dracaena. Grows into sort of a tree. - Oh, where are the trees?|- Right outside. After you. Of course, they're only|five year olds, but... Five years to grow that?|Don't you ever get impatient? If you're impatient,|you have no business growing trees. Someday I'm gonna tear down the old mill|and put in more silver tip spruce there. - What's in the old mill?|- Oh, nothing. Could we go in?|I love to poke around old buildings. [Door Creaking] That's the old millstone.|Grandpa used to grind his flour here. Watch the cobwebs. That's the loft where|he used to store his grain. Oh! Oh, look. Oh! Wedgwood.|If we could only find the pieces. - What would you do with it?|- I'd steal it. I love wedgwood. It was probably thrown there|because the pieces were missing. Better leave it. Seen enough? No, I haven't even started. I suppose these old beams|are rotted. No, they're oak.|They're good for another hundred years. And the stairs?|What's up there? I don't know.|I haven't been there since I was a kid. - It's pretty dirty... full of cobwebs.|- Oh, I don't mind. [Gasping] Did the bird|frighten you, Mrs. Scott? Well, it...|it would frighten anyone. A fireplace.|Why, that makes it perfect. Perfect? For what? Why, a perfect place|for you to live. It would take a lot of work,|but it'd be worth it. - I've got a place to live.|- Oh. You don't intend to live|in that room all your life. - I hadn't thought about it.|- You'll have to one of these days. You'll meet a nice girl...|- I've met plenty of girls. Nice and otherwise. Well, not the right one. And when you do...|Or do you think you're not susceptible? No. I don't think that. Well, it's getting|a little late. I'm sorry. I wasn't|trying to arrange your life. After all, it's|none of my business. [Dove Cooing] [Door Creaking, Closing] I'm going upstate to buy some trees|for some friends of mine. I'll be gone a couple of weeks.|I'll see you when I get back. - No, l...|- I'll see you. [Footsteps Approaching] ##[Piano] [Doorbell Ringing] - Hello, Cary!|- Hello, Sara. I dropped by to invite you for dinner|tonight. Mona and Mark are coming. Mona?|- I know, but I owe them a dinner. Besides, Mona can be amusing|unless you happen to be her target. I suppose I should say yes. I haven't|been out since harvey left town. But mona...|I didn't mean that the way it sounded. You can't sit around here|with nothing to do. You should at least|get a television set. - Oh, no!|- Why? Because it's supposed|to be the last refuge for lonely women? That's very sweet of you,|but I don't want a television. All right, but I've already spoken|to the local television man about you. [Doorbell Ringing] - You really should get one...|- Excuse me. - Hello.|- Hello. I was just going to drop in|on some friends of mine. I thought you might like|to come along. Well... won't you come in? Thank you. They'll probably ask us|to stay for dinner. I have a guest right this minute.|Could you wait? Cary?|- Yes, Sara? - Mrs. Warren, this is Mr...|- Kirby. How do you do? I can't stay.|I'll see you tonight. Would you be terribly disappointed|if I didn't come tonight? Of course not! I understand if you're|not in the mood for Mona's gossip. - We'll make it next week. Bye.|- Good-bye, Mrs. Warren. You are coming. Well... Yes. It'll be cold by the time we get back.|Better take a warm coat. [Horn Honking] Hey, Mick! I'll be right back.|Hey, Mick! [Car Door Closing] - Hi, Ron.|- Hi. [Laughing] [Laughing Continues] [Ron] Hi! - I'd like you to meet Mick and Alida.|- How do you do? - Hello.|- Hello, Cary. What a nice surprise.|Come on upstairs. - You're just in time for the clambake.|- Good! - Come on in.|- Thank you. - It's a little chilly in here.|- I'll have a fire in a moment. I'll take your coat. - Say, Ron, why don't you start it?|- Okay. I'll make an anderson special, a talent|I developed on the ulcer circuit. Freely translated,|the advertising business. You wouldn't believe it,|but he was once a v.i.p. In New York. No, you're the one that taught him|to be a very independent person. The only thing he ever taught me was|how to open a wine bottle with my teeth. To hear them tell it,|you'd think they spent the war... crawling from|wine cellar to wine cellar. [Ron] We did!|- Make cary comfortable, will you, Ron? All right.|Sit down, Cary. - What did you say about me outside?|- When? When he looked at me|and laughed. I told him you had the prettiest legs|I'd ever seen. - Here is the Anderson special.|- Oh, it's heavy! Put the cauldron on the fire,|will you, old man? - You're in for a shore dinner.|- Hope you like it. - I do.|- Good! - Here you are, Cary. Alida.|- Thank you. Here's to those who wish us well, and|those that don't can go to hackensack. Salud. - How do you like it?|- Marvelous. What's in them? First you get some ice, two jiggers|of clements, a little twist of... Mick, stop it! - You can help me bring up some wine.|- We'll be right back. - How many are coming tonight?|- You never can tell. That's so true.|You never know with that boy. Which means I better get busy. - Can I help you?|- Oh, no, make yourself comfortable. "The mass of men lead lives|of quiet desperation. "Why should we be in such|desperate haste to succeed? "If a man does not keep pace|with his companions, "perhaps it is because|he hears a different drummer. "Let him step to the music|which he hears, however measured... or far away." - Why, that's beautiful.|- That's mick's bible. He quotes from it|constantly. - Please let me help.|- All right. Come on. Kind of heavy. - Is it Ron's bible too?|- Hmm? I don't think Ron's ever read it.|He just lives it. - Put it in the middle.|- All right. Thank you. - Alida?|- Hmm? taught Mick? Well, it's kind of|hard to explain. I guess all of us|are looking for security these days. You see, Mick thought...|Well, like a lot of other people... that if he had money and an important|position it would make him secure. Then when he met Ron who didn't have|either one and didn't seem to need them, He was completely baffled. Mick a long time to figure it out. What was the answer? To thine own self be true.|That's Ron. comes from inside himself. take it away. Ron absolutely refuses to let|unimportant things become important. That's what Mick|and I were doing. We were. In fact, things got so bad|between us that... right before he went to Korea|we were thinking of a separation. You seem so happy. Not then.|We weren't happy then. Our whole life was devoted|to keeping up with theJoneses. But when Mick was wounded|and had a lot of time to think, He decided to get off|that merry-go-round. When he came back,|he put it right up to me. [Woman] Alida!|- Yeah? My room's a mess,|but don't bother. I'm off! - Wait!|- I can't, I'm late. See you tomorrow. - Mary Ann! What time?|- I don't know. In the afternoon. [Ron Chuckling] Mary Ann! - I didn't know you were coming.|- Why, sure. - [Mary Ann] Now I'm disappointed.|- Why? I thought it was just another|of Mick and Alida's get-togethers. - If i'd known... I want a rain check.|- Name it. - To go swimming with you again.|- It's too cold. - How about sailing then?|- Fine. - Before it gets too cold for that too.|- I have a windbreaker. - What about me?|- You'll be warm enough. You never take me seriously. Drive carefully, Mary Ann! My young cousin.|She's spending the winter with us. She thought our party sounded dull, so|she arranged to stay with a girlfriend. - Think this will be enough?|- Yes. darling? What have you been doing? I thought|you'd have the heavy work done. - Put the bottles down.|- Think 16 will be enough? - With this crowd? Thanks.|- You betcha. Oh, no, thanks, honey, but there's some|tablecloths in the right-hand drawer. - Lobsters have arrived!|- Look, I got 'em! Hey, Manuel! Thank you! I caught myself|this morning! - This is Manuel, the lobster king.|- Hello! My pleasure.|She's beautiful! My wife Rozanne. Tanto gusto! Mi hija, Marguerita.|- How do you do? Marguerita is a very good cook.|She makes this corn bread... Hey, hey, hey!|Get your paws off! [Rozanne] Alida!|- It's so good seeing you. You will love the lobsters.|Mick, let me help you. Well, Grandpa! How are ya?|Let me take your coat. Cary, this is Grandpa Adams.|He's a beekeeper and artist. - You must see his one-man show.|- Why, I hope to. Of course, Miss Cary, I'm not|an abstractionist. Strictly primitive. [Alida] Come on in, Grandpa! Edna, what a beautiful cake! Meet Miss Pidway, head of the Audubon|Society and an outstanding bird-watcher. - How do you do?|- How do you do? - Glass of wine, Manuel?|- Two glasses of wine for Manuel! - A dollar says you can't.|- Why, put it on your bill. I've never seen this|done before. - I wouldn't try that with my new teeth!|- Oh, no. - [Cork Popping]|- Ha-ha! # My, my, my|I have rovey eye # # How he fly|all around the town # # Eye, eye, eye|every passerby # # He look-a her up|he look-a her down|ooh-hoo # # Ooh-hoo # #Lady, what a pleasant view #|- Thank you. # Ooh-hoo #|[Wolf Whistle] # I make the flirty eye|at you # No more fly # #All around the town # # Not since I find|a passerby # # She look-a me up|Me look-a her down # # She and me we go to town # Hey, Mick, take over. # Da-da, da-da, da # # Da, da, da # # ah, ha, ha # - Hey! [Muttering]|- [Laughing] [Manuel Continues Muttering] - Faster, mick!|- ## [Tempo Increases] [Cary]|Oh! Hey! Hey! Hey! - [Laughing]|- Oh! Hey, everybody!|The lobsters! [Chattering, Laughing] [Alida]|Get 'em out of the way. There! [Doorbell Ringing] Mrs. Scott?|- Yes? I'm Mr. Week. Mrs. Warren told me|you might be interested in television. Most of my ladies tell me|tv gives them something to do. Mrs. Warren has made a mistake.|I'm not interested in television. I'm in a terrible hurry.|Will you excuse me? May I call again, Mrs. Scott... [Car Horn Honking] When you called me|to hurry, I hurried. Did you have anything better to do|of a Saturday afternoon? No, as a matter of fact, the children|aren't coming up this weekend. After you. Oooh! What you've done to it! And the fireplace!|Oh, it's so friendly. And you put in|this big window. What a beautiful view|of the pond. - Why, you can see for miles!|- Mm-hmm. - The sun comes up right over that hill.|- Oh! - Do you like it?|- Why, it's unbelievable. Let's take your boots off, huh? Of course, there's a lot of work to|be done yet, but it'll be worth it. - Your feet are cold.|- I know. They're frozen. - The teapot. You found all the pieces.|- Mm-hmm. It took days and days.|[Chuckles] These stairs are|moving to the loft. I'll add the bedroom up there. The old millstone|I'm trying to make into a table. You know why I've started|to fix the place? I didn't want to say anything until|I knew I could make it livable... for us. Do you understand|What I'm saying, Cary? Yes. I'm asking you to marry me. I love you, Cary. L... I just hadn't|thought about marriage. Why do you think|I've been seeing you? I didn't think. - Can't you see it's impossible?|- No. This is the only thing|that matters. No. There are|other things that matter. The children... How could I ask them|to give up their home? Home is where you are, Cary. But the kind of life you lead,|l... I don't know that life. How could I make sure|it would work out? You can't, Cary.|You can't! Don't you see I'd be turning my back|on everything I've ever known? - Isn't it enough we love each other?|- No, cary. It isn't.|It isn't enough for either of us. You're running away from something|important because you're afraid. - Afraid?|- Mm-hmm. - Of what?|- Many things. Perhaps you're right. It's absurd|to think of marriage. - It's out of the question.|- Cary! The hours|you've spent mending it. Doesn't matter. Cary. Don't forget your boots. I'll help you.|You mustn't catch cold. [Sobbing] Darling, don't cry. Oh, Ron,|I love you so much. What are you|thinking about? That I love you. It won't be easy. There will be|a lot of things that... You'll have to help me. I'll help all I can. - It's getting late.|- Mm-hmm. Does it matter? I'll take you home. with the roast twice on saturday. I kept phoning|up till 9:00 in the evening. I'm sorry,|but I completely forget. - Hello, Mrs. Plash.|- Hello. I was just thinking about you. - Pleasantly, I hope.|- Of course. I was telling Mrs. Scott|I couldn't figure out where she was. - I even phoned the club.|- Oh? The children weren't coming up so|I decided to go away for the weekend. - I'll take my roast now.|- Glad you had a chance to get away. - Where did you go, darling?|- Upstate. Good-bye.|Good-bye, Mona. It's comforting to know|she's not lonely, Mr. Gow. Mona Plash is such a gossip. It'll be all over town|by tomorrow, I'm afraid. I hate to have the children learn|about us before I tell them. Then you'd better tell them. It should be so simple. Two people who are in love|with each other, want to be married. Why is it so difficult|all of a sudden? It isn't,|if you're not afraid. That's what Mick|learned from you, isn't it? No. You can't learn that|from anybody. Mick discovered for himself that|he had to make his own decisions, that he had to be a man. And you want me to be a man. Only in that one way. Mona certainly didn't|waste any time, did she? I suppose the whole town's|talking about it. Well, she phoned me.|That's why I rushed over. Of course,|I didn't believe a word. You should. You can't be serious.|Your gardener? He isn't my gardener. He did work on the trees.|You met him. And even if he was,|I'm in love with him. And I'm going to marry him. Well, all right,|maybe I'm a snob. But it isn't just a question|of whether he's a gardener. The talk won't stop at that. younger than you are. And the fact that you're a widow.|- What does that got to do with it? - With money.|- Ron isn't interested in my money. And that he worked at your place|while Martin was still alive. People will say that all this started|before your husband died. - But that's not true. You...|- I don't! But Mona? Ha!|Mona will have a field day. Before she gets through,|the whole town will believe it. You know, Cary, as well as I do|that situations like this... bring out the hateful side|of human nature. Remember you have|Ned and Kay to think about. At their age,|what people say matters terribly. Have you stopped to think|what all these rumors will do to them? You're asking me to give up Ron because|of something in people that's mean? - I didn't say that.|- Do you think it would be good... if I were to let myself be|beaten by such hatefulness? Well, I'm not gonna do it. Let them say what they want to. And that goes for you too, Sara. I must say, Cary,|you've got stubbornness. And courage. If you want to throw me out,|I won't blame you. I apologize.|At least I can do that much. You don't have|to apologize, Sara, just... just go on being my friend. I'd be a fool not to do that. I've got to give a cocktail party|this weekend for that moron Jo-Ann. She bagged Tom Allenby. You bring Ron.|Maybe if people see him, maybe if they get to know him,|they'll accept him. Well, I'll call him. [Train Bell Clanging] Good evening, Mrs. Plash. - Hello, ned. You home for the weekend?|- Yes, I am. Just wait until you see your mother.|She's never looked so radiant. - I wish I knew her secret.|- Thank you, Mrs. Plash. - Lf you'll excuse me, I've got to hurry.|- Mm-hmm. Yoo-hoo, Mildred!|How was New York? Mother? I'm home!|Where are ya? I'll be up in a minute. Yeah. - How are you, dear?|- What were you doing in the cellar? I was putting some things|away in the storage closet. Everything was getting|so cluttered. Where's Kay? She and Freddie|were supposed to drive up together. She's upstairs.|We've been waiting for you. Why all the mystery when|you phoned? Who's coming? Oh, mother, I hope you don't mind|my borrowing your manicure set. Which is better?|Crimson snow or traffic light? [Ned] Oh, dig you. Since|when have you joined the female ranks? - All right!|- Now, Kay, Ned. I want to discuss something with you|that concerns you as much as me. You're going to get married. Why, yes.|How did you know? Oh, it had to happen. Anyone as attractive as you. Besides, you know what I think|of widows being walled up alive. Egyptian fashion. I knew you felt that way in theory. Theory and action should be one. Don't worry, Mother.|We're all for it. Oh, darlings. Hey, save that for Harvey. Harvey? Well, it isn't Harvey.|It... It's Ron Kirby. You know him.|At least you've met him. The only Kirby I know|is old Kirby the gardener. - Last I heard, he was dead.|- Ron is his son. Mother, is this a joke or something? - No, it isn't a joke, Ned.|- But, Mother, you can't... There's no point in approaching this|emotionally. Let's try to be objective. us! Just the same. Now, Mother, have you|introduced him to any of your friends? [Ned]|Yeah, what does Sara think? Well, Sara's invited us|to a cocktail party tonight. I wanted you to know him first,|so I asked Ron to come early... for a drink,|one of your special martinis. This is no time for martinis. Mother, why did you keep|this whole affair such a secret? Because subconsciously|you were afraid he wouldn't fit in? Why, Ron has no intentions|of fitting in, Kay. He's quite content|with his life the way it is. - Mother, the whole thing is impossible.|- You don't know him. - We know the type.|- And we know you, Mother. [Doorbell Ringing]|- Suppose that's him now. You must realize how|important this is to me. I'm relying on both of you|to be fair and... give Ron a chance. All right.|I'll make the martinis. [Doorbell Ringing] Won't you come in, Ron? - You know Ned and Kay?|- Yes, of course. Hello. - It's nice to see you again.|- Thank you. Shall we go into the living room? Kay, as I told you, Ron,|is doing social work in New York. sorts. - NNed, you make a very good martini.|- Not too strong for you? - You still have the nursery, Mr. Kirby?|- Oh, yes. He's going in more|for tree farming now. money in growing trees?|- There can be. The only thing I know about trees|is they make good logs. - Now's your chance to learn.|- Mother? - What happened to dad's trophy?|- Why, nothing happened to it. clutter|you were putting away? Ned. I suppose from now on,|there'll be lots of changes around here. Ned, if you mean because of my marriage|to your mother, you needn't worry. I have no intention of living here.|We'll be leading quite a different life. But this has been the family house|for I don't know how long. we were born! Ned, I wish you'd treat this matter|in a more detached fashion. You don't know Mother as we know her.|She's really much more conventional... than you seem to think she is. She has the innate desire for group|approval, which most women have. Never mind the $10 words. And where, if I may ask,|do you expect our mother... and, I suppose, us too to live? - My place.|- In a greenhouse? Oh, no, no.|He's going to remodel the old mill. Mother, if you'll excuse me, I'm going|to a lecture. I'd better get ready. Good-bye, Mr. Kirby. Mother, I've got some|studying to catch up on. What happened? I've never|seen them act like that before. It's natural, Cary.|I'm not like their father. What does that|got to do with it? It would be different if you were|marrying the same kind of man. Successful businessman,|pillar of the community. I can understand it. Perhaps you're right. But once I make them see that...|Shall we get started? Cary, do we really have to go? Well, Sara said that...|And anyway, I want to show you off. - We can take my car.|- Mine's right here. - Does it matter that much?|- It shouldn't. Jim, get me another one, will you?|I don't want to miss the arrival. - How about you, Mrs. Taylor?|- Well, I really shouldn't, but... Excuse me. If you see cary before I do,|let me know. It'll be easier for her|if I took them around. - Count on it, Sara. Got a light?|- I may need to. Hold my drink, dear.|A gardener? Why doesn't he find himself|a decent money-making vocation? You think material success is the only|end worthy of pursuit of man? - What's wrong with money?|- You have to have it to have contempt. Excuse me. Thank you. Do you really think|she'll have the nerve to come? - Oh, there they are now!|- They're here! - Just look at that car.|- Just look at that man. Daughter! It's always the quiet ones,|isn't it? But she's certainly the last person|you'd expect to... Always pretending|to be so prim and proper. Why, Howard,|did she turn you down? I'm Cary's best friend. - I'd like to be your friend too.|- Thank you. Come on, darling. George. - Cary, my favorite woman.|- George, I want you to know Ron Kirby. - Used to know your father. Fine man.|- Thank you. Shall we say hello to Romeo|and his Juliet? Come on, darling. So that's Cary's nature boy. - You know the doctor, Dan.|- Hello, Cary. You know Miss Frisbee,|Mr. Allenby. Mr. Kirby. - How do you do?|- How do you do? This was kind of|supposed to be my party, but looks like Mrs. Scott's|getting the attention. I guess it is more unusual|when someone your age gets married. But I think your friend's|awfully lucky. You see, no one in my family's|had a dime since the civil war. So, Tom won't get anything|but poor little me. My dear. What's this I hear about... Oh. Haven't I seen you|somewhere before? Well, Mrs. Humphrey,|probably in your garden. three years. Oh, yes, of course. - Ah, sara, I really must be going.|- I'll be right back. Come into the bar. You've earned|yourself a good strong drink. - Go ahead, Ron.|- I'll be right back. All right. - Howard.|- Hi. How are you? - Mona, Mark.|- Oh, my dear, he's fascinating. And that tan!|I suppose from working outdoors. he's handy indoors too. Mona's sure got your number, Cary. So have I. Well, excuse me, Howard. ##[Piano] Guess you played me for a prize sucker|that night at the club, huh? Goin' into that perfect lady routine.|Makin' me apologize. If I'd known then|what I know now, - would have had a different ending.|- Oh, Howard. Never too late, huh, Cary?|Line forms to the right. - Howard, you're drunk!|- Why, Cary! Isn't one man|enough for you? Maybe you'd better stay|right where you are. What is it, Cary? [Sara] Believed what? type. You seem to attract that, Cary. - Shall we go?|- Yes. - Excuse us.|- Oh, george! Why, that man was|positively murderous. - Did you see that, Fred?|- What's the commotion? He might have|killed poor Howard. - And in Sara's lovely house too!|- Well! Car Door Closing] Nothing's important except us. Will you remember that? Yes. - I'll take you to the door.|- No, Ron. Thank you, but... good night. Good night. Engine Starting] Ned, you're still up? Don't forget to put the screen around|the fireplace before you come up. Mom... I've got a few things|to say to you, Mother. All right, Ned. I just want to tell you, meeting him|hasn't changed my mind one darn bit. We did what you asked. I asked you to give Ron a fair chance.|I don't think you did. Just because we didn't agree|with your choice? Listen, Mother, somebody in this|family's gotta think straight. And you don't think I can? I think all you see is|a good-looking set of muscles. Why, Ned! That's the way it looks,|doesn't it? You're planning to give up a home that's|been in the family for I don't know... There's a certain tradition. Aand for what? Don't you realize|what people are gonna say? Haven't you any sense|of obligation to father's memory? What does that|got to do with it? How can you think of marrying Kirby|when you've been Father's wife? - It's against everything.|- Nonsense, Ned. Mother... are you really|intending to go through with this? Yes, I am. me|to come visit ya. How could I bring my friends?|I'd be ashamed. Ned! Ned, we mustn't let this|come between us. If you mean Kirby,|he already has! [Door Slamming] And then Ned|on top of everything else. No, I haven't heard a word.|I've got a call in for him. Well, Kay stayed over. [Door Closing] the talk will die down? Kay? Sara, I'll have to call you back later.|All right. [Sobbing] [Door Opening] - Kay, darling, what is it?|- [Sobbing] What's the matter?|Well, tell me. [Sobbing]|Nothing. It... - [Sobbing]|- It's about me, isn't it? Freddie and I|were at the library. One of the kids|made a crack about you. What did they say? That you and Mr. Kirby were...|even before Daddy... Now, you stop that, Kay.|You know that's a lie. Of course I do,|and I told them so! They went on and on|and I got mad and... We were asked to leave.|[Sobbing] [Sobbing]|- Oh, darling. And on the way home|Freddie and I had a fight. I told him that I didn't care|what people said. But, Mama, I do care!|I care terribly! - [Sobbing]|- Oh, Kay, l... I don't know what to do. I can't bear to see|you and ned so unhappy. - [Sniffling]|- But, you see, Kay, I love Ron. You love him so much|you're willing to ruin all our lives? - You can't really think that.|- What else can I think? But, Kay, you've talked|so much about people... and why they do|the things they do. - You say you understand.|- But I don't! I don't! I thought I did. [Sobbing] [Knocking] Cary? - Oh, Ron, l...|- What's the matter? Well, Ned's left home and l... I left Kay in tears. Some of her|friends have been dreadful to her. Because of me? Ron, we're gonna have|to wait to get married. - Why?|- Well... To give the children|a chance to get used to the idea. They'll feel differently|when they know you better. - You don't want to marry me?|- I'm not saying that. I'm asking you to be patient.|It's only a question of time. Only of time? Right now everybody's talking about us.|We're a local sensation. Like Sara said, if the people get used|to seeing us together, then maybe|they'll accept us. You mean, we'll be invited|to all the cocktail parties. And, of course, Sara will see to it|I get into the country club. Dear Howard and I will|shake hands and forget. - And Mona won't be malicious.|- That isn't what I mean. And ned and kay|won't mind so much... because we'll be living|just as you always have. - Probably in your house.|- What's wrong with that? It's only for a little while.|It would make things so much easier. It wouldn't change you.|You couldn't be changed. Yes, I could. I'm learning right now how easy|it would be to let myself be changed. - By whom?|- By you. I'm sorry, Cary.|But it wouldn't work. I can't live that way.|You knew that from the beginning. But I can't ruin|my children's lives. I have a responsibility to them. Are you sure it's just that? Well, what do you mean? - You don't think I care what people say.|- Yes, I do. You're not even trying|to understand. - How can you say you love me...|- God knows I love you. But I won't let Ned nor Kay|nor anyone else run our lives. Don't you see we could never|be happy if we did? I can see that you don't want to listen|to anybody's ideas but your own. I can see that you're trying to make|me choose between you and the children! No, Cary, you're the one|that made it a question of choosing. So you're the one|that'll have to choose. All right. It's all over. Cary? [Door Closing] I admit, after meeting him,|he's a darn nice guy, but l... But I still say|you did the right thing. Oh... I suppose so. Everyone will welcome you back|to the fold. I'll see to that. I don't know what i'd do|without you, Sara. I know what you've been|going through. I know it hasn't been easy.|But at least you have the children. with club work and parties. [Phone Ringing] That must be Ned.|I have a call in for him. You've told Kay?|- Yes, she's very happy. - Hello?|- [Woman] Mrs. Scott? - Yes.|- I have your party now. - [Ned] Mother, you called me?|- Yes, Ned, I did. I wanted to talk to you.|I, um... I've decided that... Well, I'm not going|to be married. - Oh, great.|- You will be up this weekend? You bet, Mom.|I got a class now, so good-bye, huh? - Well, Ned... Ned?|- [Phone Disconnects] Was he pleased? Yes, he...|He seemed to be. - Hello, dear!|- Bill! I thought you'd never get here. - What's for dinner?|- Good night. Say hello to the children. - Hello, Cary. Nice to see you.|- Hello, Doctor. Nice to see you. I've been meaning to call you|about a checkup. I don't think it's serious, but|I've been having miserable headaches. - Any time. Can I give you a lift?|- I'm waiting for the children. - Let me hear from you now.|- All right. [Train Whistle Blowing] Oh, Mrs. Scott. Seems the kids couldn't make it. Guess they're pretty busy|with the holidays coming on. Something in a christmas tree,|ma'am? Oh, hiya, Mrs. Scott. - Merry christmas!|- Merry christmas, Tom. - Like this one?|- I need one bigger than this. - How about this?|- That's not very pretty. I'll show ya another one. Hello, Cary. Well, hello. I, uh... I have to get a tree|for the children, and I saw these. How are you? - How about this pine, Mrs. Scott?|- Oh, I'm fine. [Clearing Throat] No, not that one. L... I didn't know|they were your trees. No, they're Mick's. I'm helping him unload. - How are Mick and Alida?|- Fine. Will you say hello|to them for me? They'll be right back.|They're doing some christmas shopping. Here's a medium-sized fir,|Mrs. Scott. Or maybe you'd rather have a spruce? - A silver tip spruce?|- Oh, I've got a beauty! You remembered.|Oh, Cary... Ron! Ron? Mick and Alida sent me|to get you. Oh, I didn't know|you had a customer. How about this one,|Mrs. Scott? No. Send this one to me. Ron? Shall we go? Yeah. #Let heaven and nature sing # #Let heaven and heaven # #And nature sing # - #Joy to the world #|- [Bells Jingling] #The Lord is come # # Let earth receive her king # prepare Him room # #And heaven|and nature sing # and nature sing # and heaven # #And nature sing # the Lord is come # receive her king ## - Hello, Mama! Merry Christmas!|- Merry Christmas! - Thought we'd never get here.|- I'm so happy to see you. - Oh, it looks gorgeous!|- Hey, look at all that loot! - Is that for me?|- Where's our present for you? Nothing's come.|But don't worry about it. - Just having the two of you is enough.|- I better phone. - Not here. It's a secret!|- [Chuckling] - Don't open anything until I get back.|- All right. Mama! Look! Why, that's lovely, Kay. Freddie and I|are going to be married. In february,|after he graduates. Well, aren't you a little young? You were 17 when you got married. But... it's so soon. Soon?|Oh, it seems like forever. Oh, Mama! Remember the afternoon|that Freddie and I had the big fight? each other. Mama, he's so wonderful. Yes, I remember. That was the day you told me your life|would be ruined if I married Ron. I was being childish. You shouldn't|have let me get away with it. Of course, that was different. You didn't really love him,|did you? Mother! Your present's on the way. Hey, this is Christmas.|Let's enjoy it. After all, it'll probably|be the last one we spend in this house. What do you mean? Kay's getting married.|And if I'm not called up right away, I'm in line for the Walker Scholarship|which means a year in Paris. with the Dayton Company. I didn't want to tell you till|I had it pretty well cinched. Hey, Mother. Thank you. Yes, with Kay and I away,|I think we should sell the house. The house? It's too big for one person.|What with taxes... [Doorbell Ringing]|- There's your present now. [Sighing]|Tsk! [Door Opening]|- Mama? [Door Closing] Don't you see, Kay?|The whole thing's been so pointless. Oh, mama, I'm...|I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. [Sobbing, Sniffling] Mama, it still isn't too late,|if he loves you. [Sighing] Mother? Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Mrs. Scott,|and Happy New Year. Kay and I couldn't afford|anything but a table model. and it's easy to operate. All you have to do is turn that dial and|you have all the company you want... right there on the screen. at your fingertips. Fetch, go on!|Fetch, old boy! Ha, ha!|Boy, are you slippin'. Why don't you try|using shells in that gun? - Doesn't seem to help.|- Ha, ha! Can't shoot straight anymore,|I guess. I don't seem to be good|for anything lately. You haven't been good for anything|since you and Cary broke up. - What's that got to do with it?|- Everything, and you know it. You're not the same anymore. You're no good to me,|yourself or anyone. All right,|so what do I do about it? - Call her up. Go see her. Apologize.|- Apologize for what? I don't know for what.|For anything. Make up something. [Dog Whining] That's a boy. Good boy.|Hey, nice, huh? Look, Mick,|I told her that I love her. I asked her to marry me. I can't force|her. She has to make up her own mind. She doesn't want to make up her|own mind. No girl does. She wants you|to make it up for her. - Come on, let's go.|- No, I'll be along later. Gotta catch one pheasant|at least. Hey, uh...|Well, uh... You know. [Laughing] Well, Dan,|what's the verdict? I was just going over|the findings. There's nothing organically|wrong with you, Cary. Why do I have|these headaches? It's not my imagination.|And they're getting worse all the time. - You're punishing yourself.|- For what? For running away from life. Headaches|are nature's way of making a protest. Will you give me|something for them? Do you expect me to give you|a prescription to cure life? Sit down.|I want to talk to you. Forget for a moment|that I'm your doctor. Let me give you some advice|as a friend. Marry him. [Whispering]|Oh. Well, there's no point|in discussing that. - It's all over.|- Apparently it isn't. - You still have the headaches.|- But that's silly. And anyway,|how could I marry him? The whole thing was impossible|from the beginning. You know, Dan, in a place like|Stoningham, you can't ignore convention. So you gave up a man you were|in love with because of others? And you had the great satisfaction|of being taken back into the fold. I was thinking of my children. were before. Lonelier, in fact, and ned abroad. Sso what good|was your noble sacrifice? Cary, marry him. Oh, it... it's too late. And maybe he's|found someone else. Anyway, if he'd really loved me,|he would have come to me. No! If you'd loved him,|you'd have gone to him! In spite of the town,|the children, everything. Let's face it. You were ready|for a love affair, but not for love. Good-bye, Dan. [Door Closing] [Horn Honking] - Cary!|- Hello, Alida! Hi! - It's so good to see you!|- It's so good to see you! What were you doing in the doctor's|office? Nothing wrong, is there? Oh, no. Just a checkup.|He couldn't find a thing wrong with me. - Would you have a cup of tea?|- I'd love to, but I'm late. - I have to pick up Mary Ann.|- Mary ann? She's getting married, you know.|- Married? been going together for a year now. I don't think you've met this one. I have to dash. Come by and see us,|We miss you! - I appreciate that. Good-bye, Alida.|- Bye! Cary! C... Cary! Cary! [Doorbell Ringing] - Alida?|- Hello, Cary. - Come on in.|- I thought I should come over. - There's been an accident, Cary.|- It's ron. - You better come with me.|- How bad is he? Don't know yet.|Dr. Hennessy and Mick are with him now. - Oh, alida.|- Get your coat first. [Footsteps Running] Mrs. Scott.|Please, Mrs. Scott. - How is he?|- We don't know anything yet. - Where's Mr. Anderson?|- He took the doctor back to town. - Well, didn't he...|- Nothing that he could have done. He'll be back|in the morning. I'm sorry, Mrs. Scott.|I have strict orders. He can't be disturbed.|He must be kept quiet. Let me take your coat. Why don't you sit down?|I'll get some coffee. Wish Mick had waited. But I'm sure the doctor wouldn't have|gone if he thought there were... Alida. This room. The beauty that|Ron's put into it. And the love. He never gave up hope|that you'd come back, Cary. You told me once that|Ron was so secure within himself. Because he refused to give importance|to unimportant things. Why did it take me so long|to understand it? Remember I told you it took us|a long time to find the right answer? It doesn't happen overnight. I feel like such a coward. I was so frightened.|I let others make my decisions. Alida, I've let so many people|come between us. Friends, neighbors, children. And the strangest one of all, myself. Don't worry about things|in the past. Isn't that|unimportant too, hmm? If only I haven't|waited too long. Your coffee. Thank you, but I really|don't care for any. Why don't you go upstairs|and rest a while? Try to sleep. I couldn't sleep.|I want to stay here in case he wakes up. May I sit over there? Well, all right. [Chiming] [Chiming Continues] - Well, Dan?|- He's got a concussion. Otherwise, I'd get him to the hospital. It's gonna take time|for him to recover. Dan, what can I do? You plan to stay? Yes. No more running away. He'll need rest and care.|And he'll need you, CCary. Nurse. Cary. Yes, Ron. You've come home. Yes, darling, I've...|I've come home.
