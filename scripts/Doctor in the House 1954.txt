New term wouldn't seem the same without you. Thank you. What's the prescription? Same? Yes. The Dean's coming along now. I suppose I'd better make an appearance. - I think you'd better. - At least I can read the paper. Excuse me. - Hm? - I'm a new medical student. Are you, now? Well, I'm a very old doctor. I was wondering where I should go. Take my advice - straight into another profession. - How much? - 15 shillings on the clock. 15 shillings?! What? From Waterloo station? - Via the Windmill Theatre. - Oh. Clock's a bit fast, isn't it? - 15 bob, mate. - Hey, Taffy! - Back in a tick. - Hey! Where you going? Hello! - Taffy, lend me a pound. - A pound? Where would I get a pound? And you owe me 32 bob. You'll get it back. A bookie I met... I haven't got a pound. How did you do in the anatomy exam? - Failed. - Me, too. Those examiners never asked a question I knew. - Back where we started. - Never mind. Plenty of football. - Hello, Mr Benskin, Mr Evans. - Hello, Jessup, you old rogue. - Had a nice holiday? - Shocking run of losers. - Any letters? - Only bills, sir. - Throw them away. - Can you get me a head and neck? - I want a brain. - I don't know about a brain, sir. Brains is hard to come by these days. Times aren't what they were. - Both failed your exam, eh? - Back with the new boys... and girls. - You'll pass this time. - What time is the Dean talking? Five o'clock. You'd better get going. I'm about to ring. I left a taxi waiting at the gate. Pay him off, there's a good fellow. - Excuse me, I... - Sit down here, please. - Name? - Sparrow. Simon Sparrow. - Have you been here before? - No. - Have you a doctor's letter? - Do I need one? - You're making it very difficult. - I'm sorry. I... - Have you been here before or not? - No. Very well. Go in there and take your clothes off. - Now, wait... - Really! You are the limit. - What's the matter, Nurse? - This patient won't undress. Won't he? We'll see about that. I've been trying to explain. I'm a new medical student. - Taff, me boy. - Hello, Grim. How are you? - Hello, Tony. How's the love life? - Easy come, easy go. Excuse me. Could you tell me where the students go? Well, certainly not in here. - Where are you looking for? - Actually, I'm new. - Could you tell me where to go? - The medical school. - That's right over the other side. - Could you tell me how to get there? Go past Physiotherapy, right at Neuropathology, left by Gastroenterology, till you come to the main hall. - Then it's... - That's not the quickest way. Go down there by DXR and EEG, then straight on past ECG, till you get to the almoner's office. No, it's... You're going in the right direction. Thank you... very much. You took the stitches out too soon! - Funny. - Let me help you. It is customary for me, as dean of this hospital, to welcome new students at the beginning of each year, but thanks to the vigilance of the examiners in protecting the public against the medical ministrations of idiots, I see that I am welcoming many familiar faces, as well. Medical students, gentlemen, were described by Charles Dickens as "a parcel of lazy, idle fellows "that are always smoking and drinking and lounging." That is, unfortunately, still true, and the time has come, gentlemen, for a change. Mr Evans, I suggest you devote to your studies some fraction of the energy you expend on the football field. And Mr Benskin, I would ask you in future kindly to remember that nurses are here for the comfort of the patients, not the students. Furthermore, you will be expected to arrive at every lecture punctually. Last term, it was a disgrace. Students thought they could come in at any time that suited them... Good afternoon. Won't you be seated? - May I continue? - Oh, yes. Thank you. Your course here will be for a minimum of five years. Those of you who at the end of that time satisfy the examiners you have sufficient skill will receive your degrees and be entitled to call yourselves "Doctor". It will require the greatest hard work, application and serious-mindedness from you. For your first two years you will study biochemistry, physiology, anatomy and pathology. Three minutes shorter than usual. Did he do female patients and professional etiquette? - I think he mentioned it. - He must have speeded up. - You heard it before? - Three times. Three times?! You must be a very senior... Not a bit. I haven't passed an exam yet. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I... Don't be. I always fail on purpose. Shall we see the Padre? - Is that what you usually do? - That's what I do. Come on. - Hello, Padre. - Mr Grimsdyke. Nice to see you. - Nice to see you. How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Good. Meet... What's your name? - Sparrow. Simon Sparrow. - Glad to meet you, sir. New? - Yes. I expect we'll be seeing a lot of you. What'll it be, gentlemen? - Two pints, please. Beer all right? - Guinness. Make one a Guinness, Padre. He's been here years. Nobody knows his name. - We call him the Padre. - Why? - Why? Shall we tell him? - Yes. Well, the patients might get a bit upset if the doctor said he was popping to the pub, but if he says he's going to chapel, they're quite impressed. - Hello, Grimsdyke. - Tony. Been home yet? Not yet. Did you see that Indian girl? Hello, hello! Are we going to be knee-deep in boiled rice this term? Oh, I beg your pardon. Simon Sparrow, Tony Benskin and Taffy Evans. - How do you do? Do you play rugby? - A little. - What's your position? - Wing. - Any good? - I was in the school team... Wonderful. Just the sort of fellow we need. I shan't have time for rugby. No time for rugby? Don't be blasphemous. - Ah, rugby... - Here you are, gentlemen. - Five shillings, please. - Well, Mrs Rivington-Lomax. - Here, here. - Five shillings. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. - Cheers, Sparrow. - Yes, cheers. - Got some rooms yet? - Not yet. - There's a list. I'll show you. - Thanks. - Have you met Hubert yet? - No. You must meet Hubert. He's one of your ancestors. There. - What is it? A specimen? - He'd be offended at that. He's the mascot, idol and oldest inhabitant of St Swithins. My dear fellow, I'm so sorry. Sir Lancelot Spratt presented him to the college as a student. St Crispins tried to pinch him after the championship. Wizard set-to that was. Three fractured mandibles. - Hello. - Hi, Tony. Here we are. Digs, digs, digs... "Two students have spare room, nine-foot-six by six-foot-nine." - How tall are you? - "Medical student received..." We're all just one big, happy family here, aren't we? Home from home. We're free to come and go as we please, as long as it isn't after 10:30pm. And we don't have visitors in our rooms, Mr Williams. We don't spend more than ten minutes in the bathroom, Mr Barton. And none of us smoke in our bedrooms. Now, Mr Porter's Ancient Greek. - Mr Williams is Economics. - Greetings, comrade. - This is my daughter Millicent. - How do you do? Mr Sparrow's a medical gentleman. How nice. I always think it's nice to have a doctor in the house. Saw a lovely film about a doctor once. He operated on a beautiful girl and married her. Come in. Doctor, I'm sorry to trouble you but will you examine my foot? Well, I'm not really a doctor. I'm only a student. That's almost the same thing, isn't it? Well... What's the, er, matter with your... foot? I think I must have twisted it or something. It's ever so painful. - Well, all right. - Oh, thanks. Don't bother to take off your stocking. I can manage with it on. - That hurt? - Yes. Does that hurt? Yes, but I don't mind. You've got such lovely, soft hands. There's nothing seriously wrong. - Cold poultice, that's the thing. - Is that all? - That'll do the trick. - Will you put it on? No, get your mother to do that. I'm very busy. Oh, well. Thanks a lot. Good night. Good night. Ripe tomatoes! Lovely apples! I say, do I really have to learn all this? I'm afraid so, sir. Wait till you start your clinical studies. Don't worry. I'll see you through. May I recommend this? It's not on your list but if you have difficulty, you might be glad of it. - What is it? - The Student's Friend. - Fits easily into the pocket. - Put it with the others. You won't regret that. I must give you copy of this. Yes, and I also want a skeleton. Naturally. One can't get anywhere without a skeleton. Would you like the ordinary skeleton or the de luxe with hands and feet? - I think the ordinary one will do. - Very well. I'm not sure but this one might suit me better. No, sir. This has the most perfect pelvis of any skeleton I've seen. Oh. Ripe tomatoes! Two bobs a pineapple! Hurry along there. Now, come on. Hurry along. Hold tight, please. Grim, I've gone a bit wrong. Can I look at yours? Jolly colour, isn't it? Like crme de menthe. I'd like a waistcoat like that. - Is that the colour it should be? - I'm afraid so. If I go on like this, I'll pass the exam. - Don't you want to? - Heaven forbid. I must muck this up. Let's see. What have we got here? A spot of this. Now a drop of what you fancy. I say! That's a most pleasing effect, don't you think? - There you are. - Ta. Mrs Rivington-Lomax. Mrs Rivington-Lomax. I ought to know who she was. Who was she? A hospital benefactress? A benefactress, but not of St Swithins, of me. She was my grandmother, bless her. Rather a gruesome old lady, but well-to-do. She spent the twilight of her life surrounded by the medical profession, about every member of which she was besotted. Then one morning she said to me, "If you'll train to be a doctor, I'll allow you a thousand a year." Well, medical training can last a lifetime, if one wishes. - So, of course, you accepted. - She put it in her will that night. It's not a gracious living but at least one hasn't got to work for it. I'm not partial to anything strenuous, are you? Chopsticks? One, two... This demonstrates that the faster the subject pedals, the more oxygen he consumes. Faster, lad. Put your back into it. You've got to work! Work! And that applies to you all. You've all got to work. And now drains, ladies and gentlemen. Drains. Immensely important factors in the health of the public. I've studied them all my life. You must, too, to be efficient doctors. There's only one thing more important than drainage. What is that? Sewage. Come in. - Well? - It's moved up to my hip now. Out! Landlady's daughter. Oldest joke in the world. - She went too far. - Women are all the same. The psychiatric ward calls it "behaviour pattern". - I've given in my notice. - I don't get why. She sounds a good show, if you like that sort of thing. - Doesn't help your rugby. - Found anywhere else? - No. - Do you drink beer in bed? - No. - Oh! I'd ask you move in but the domestic climate isn't congenial. - I could learn to drink beer in bed. - Ah! Oh, no! - Come in, will you? - Well, I think I've made a mistake. I've come to the wrong flat. I was looking for Mr Grimsdyke. I'm his fiance Stella. I live in the flat below. Oh! How do you do? You're going to sleep in there. Have you had tea? - Hm? No, I haven't yet. - Oh, the kitchen's in there. I have to go. I'm in a hurry. I'm borrowing the bathroom because mine doesn't work. Excuse me. Oh, could you do this for me? It got caught. Certainly. Thank you. And will you bring me a cup in? - What? In there?! - Yes, I don't mind. - You're all doctors, aren't you? - Oh, yes. Yes. There you are. Sorry I wasn't here to meet you. I was being feudal with my tailor. - Made yourself at home? - Er, yes. There's a lady called Stella having a bath. Ah, Stella, my fiance. You've met. Ravishingly beautiful. Adores me. Splendid thing to have around. Did you notice her sternum? - No. - You should. It's exquisite. - Richard! - She probably wants her back washed. Is this is what Mrs Rivington-Lomax envisaged for her favourite grandson? - Richard! - Coming. Hello, darling. Mmm... I forgot to tell Simon I had a fiance. I have something to tell you, Richard. You haven't. - Oh, not much I haven't. - No, I'm serious. I've been thinking. I'm not marrying you. - What?! - I hope he brought his own soap. Of course you'll marry me. You're in love with me. But I want to marry a proper doctor. I can't spend my life as the wife of a student. It wouldn't be decent. Now I must hurry or I'll miss my train. Did you tell him we all have our own soap? To hell with his soap! What train? I've got a ticket for Sweden. They have a lot of proper doctors there. - A ticket for Sweden?! - Yes. It's in my bag. - This means I'll have to qualify. - Yes. - Well, my allowance will stop. - Yes. If Granny's allowance stops, we... - Good heavens! I'll have to work! - Yes. - And you say you're in love with me? - I am. - Aren't you in love with me? - Oh! You know I am but aren't you in love with my grandmother just a bit? Mm-mm, but if you were a proper doctor, I'd love you both. - Well... - Now I must wash and go to Sweden. I must have time to think. Five minutes. I'm a very quick bath lady. You've got to work, gentlemen. Work, work, work, work, work... Hydroxyl groups become a hydrogen atom linked to a carbon atom. Two stereoisomers are possible. Alpha and beta indicate the isomers on which the hydroxyls are above and below the plane of the ring. That's... perfectly clear, I suppose. Why didn't we select professions with no exams, like cabinet ministers? Do you think they'll ask about sarcoidosis? - What's that? - I haven't the foggiest. If there's one on anxiety, I'm home and dry. - You all nervous? - Oh, my... Well, we're not overflowing with confidence. Your psychological attitude is all wrong. You're expecting failure. I'm not. I just don't admit the idea of failure. It doesn't exist. I expect a pass. One wonders which examiner will be frustrated enough to make it. - Phew! Cigarette, chum, please. - How did you do? That exam was an instrument of torture. Sarcoidosis. They must have heard me. - It's over now. - There's worse to come. Excuse me. You see? Easy, wasn't it? Ah! Your slip's showing! - I feel very peculiar. - Are you ill? I don't know. I think it's passing that anatomy exam. It's upset me. Clever boy. I feel better. It's extraordinary how efficacious female companionship is. - Simon, I think you should have one. - Oh, should I? Taffy, shouldn't Simon have a female companion? No! Not till after the rugby season. Thank you. I've enough to do. I'm worried he has a mother fixation. - I don't think so. - We ought to find out. - Who shall we get for you? - I'll be your female companion. - I have plenty of time. - That's a very unethical suggestion. Come and get it. Dinner is served. Catch. - Fish and chips. - It's better than beans. - Salt on the chips? - Yep. We're trying to find a girl for Simon. We think he needs a practical education. Any suggestions? - What about Rigor Mortis? - That's the girl. - Who's Rigor Mortis? - One of the nurses. - No great beauty but a kind heart. - Fine for a trial run. - I don't want a trial run. - Of course you do. Nothing to it. Just hold her hand and look plaintive. I had an awful job to get here tonight. I had to swap my late duty with Nurse Gibson's bedpans. Oh. That was just before that awful case where we had to use the stomach pump. Look, would you rather have some cocoa? It is customary for me, as dean of this hospital, to welcome new students each year and to address a few words to those who are part of the way up the ladder towards qualifying. Among the latter are some whom, I must confess, I had regarded as permanent fixtures on the bottom rung. However, they have, to my surprise - and, I suspect, to theirs - succeeded in doing enough work in two years to pass their anatomy and other exams. I only hope that this state of affairs continues. This term, they will commence their clinical training in the wards. I wish them - though not very hopefully - well. - Toothbrush, sir? - Stethoscope. Certainly. Any particular type of chestpiece, sir? This type's popular. Well-balanced. No, that's a little old for you, sir. What about this one? Perhaps you'd care to try it for size? Oh, yes. That's very much more you, sir. Comfy? - Comfy? - Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Yes. It slips easily into any of the resting positions. I don't know which you prefer. There's the posterior cervical... or the axillary-inguinal position. - It's very popular, sir. - This will do. Just starting in the wards, sir? Will you pay or shall we charge it? - Are you boys coming in? - Don't be so eager. Anybody would think you charged fees. - Come on. - You're wasting your time, old boy. - Nurses only have eyes for doctors. - We are doctors, practically. And who are you? - We're the students, Sister. - Oh, are you? Well, I do not like students but I am forced to put up with you. But I warn you, I stand no nonsense on my ward. Is that clear? - As crystal, Sister. - Hmm... You will examine patients five, 12, 18 and 20. You will replace bedclothes neatly, you will not walk upon floor that has just been polished and you will not talk to the nurses, except on professional matters. - Is that understood? - Yes. Very well. You may proceed. Proceed? - Proceed where? - Choose a number and examine it. Hey, there's a new lot of students. We'll have some fun. - I don't feel like fun. - Cheer up. You're not dead yet. You will be if you let students get at you. Will they'll know we've never done this? Don't be silly. They'll think we're doctors. I can hear the sea. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Er, would you mind if I examined you? - I'm all yours, Doctor. - Oh, dear. Er... Well... It's 76. I just took it myself. Oh, thank you. Would you excuse me just a minute? - You stuck, too? - Yes. What page is appendicitis? I've no idea. I'm looking for the chest. - What are you doing, Mr Briggs? - I'm being examined, Nurse. - Are you? By whom? - Good afternoon, Nurse. Now, I'd just like to examine your chest. It's my stomach that's wrong, Doctor. Yes, of course it is. Now, what are your symptoms? Hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis and renal colic. - Thank you very much. - He has hammertoes, too. Graham said the original diagnosis was wrong, but I... Forgive me, old boy, but aren't we inclined to be talking shop? - Oh, I'm sorry. - Broaden your outlook, Simon. - There are better things in life. - Such as what? - Such as that, for instance. - Taxi! Taxi! See what I mean? - Taxi! - Look out! - There we are. - Are you all right? I think so. Aren't those roads hard? - I'm sorry, miss. Are you OK? - Yes. It was my fault. - I was too eager for a taxi. - Are you sure? Come to the hospital and we'll look you over. It's only my stockings. I don't think hospitals can help... or can they? - Er, no... - Let my colleague examine you. - I'm really fine. Are you a doctor? - Well... He's a mainstay of our hospital. Aren't you, old boy? - Er, yes. Well, yes. - How glamorous. I'll certainly visit this hospital for anything more than stockings. Do. We can always find a bed for her. Eh, Simon? Hmm? Yes. Sure. Well, if you'd help me into the taxi, I'll go home. Yes, certainly. 33 Cornwallis Mews. Goodbye. Hmm... Thanks. Bye. - 33... - Cornwallis Mews. Not a bad fit. I know it's unnecessary but no gravy spilt or anything, I beg. It's brand new. When you make love to her, do not be too English, be more aggressive. He can do without that. He's late already. - Got some cash? - Yes, I pawned my microscope. - Don't drink champagne. - Why not? Because it's bad for the wind. - Where did you say to take her? - Fernando's. I haven't been for a bit but they do a good all-in for ten bob. - Hurry up. Taxi. - Just mention my name. - Where's my coat? - Here. - And my flower. - Take it easy, now. - Good luck, dear. - Oh! - Good evening, madam. - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Simon, I won't be a minute. I'll have a Martini if you're ordering. Er, Mr Benskin told me to come here. Mr Benskin? I do not know that name, sir. Oh, he comes here quite often. Probably before the restaurant changed hands. You wish for a table, sir? I'm afraid we are very busy but as it's Miss Minster, I shall accommodate you. - You know Miss Minster? - Who does not? Something to drink, sir? Er, yes. A dry Martini and a pint of bitter, please. We don't serve beer here, sir, I'm afraid. Oh. Oh, well, then. Two dry martinis. - Large, sir? - Yes, of course. Very. - Your cloakroom ticket, sir. - Oh, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. - Oh, I do like this place. - Oh, do you? Do you come here very often? Fairly, but never with a doctor before. Whereabouts exactly in Harley Street are you? Well, I'm not actually in Harley Street. - I do research at the hospital. - Oh. - Your Martinis, sir. - Oh, thank you. Simon, these look absolutely enormous. Your bill, sir. Er... Is that absolutely right? - Two trebles, sir. - Are you in need of a stimulant? - Yes, I am rather. - Thank you, sir. - Cheers. - Good evening, sir. Miss Minster. Would you care to order now? Well, do you have any of that caviar that I had last time? Yes, Miss Minster. Also, we have some pt fresh in and some smoked salmon. After, there is some delicious filet de boeuf or some chicken la Kiev. Do you know, I don't feel very hungry at the moment. Shall we finish our drinks and order later? - Yes, if you like. - Very well, sir. I had to sit through one of those heavy luncheons by the governors. I hope you'll forgive me. Will you excuse me? I've left my cigarettes in my coat. Of course. - Isobel, how lovely to see you. - Helen, Paul. Hello? Oh, Taffy? Taffy, it's Simon here. Hmm? Simon. Listen, I'm in a terrible jam. No, I can't explain about it now. Listen, as soon as I've hung up here, call me back. It's Mayfair 11494. Yes, say you're the hospital with an urgent message for Dr Sparrow to come at once. He's awfully sweet. Very young-looking, but he must be brilliant to be able to afford to bring his pick-ups here. Simon, this is Mr and Mrs Gray. Dr Sparrow. - How do you do? - How do you do? Doctor Sparrow, I'm hesitant to suggest this, but I was wondering if we couldn't have dinner together? - Er, well... - I mean as my guests. I'm celebrating a win at the races and we'd love to make a party of it. - You mean for us to be your guests? - Yes. - That's awfully kind of you. - Fine. Well, let's order, shall we? - Simon's not very hungry. - I could pick at a little. - Dr Sparrow, sir? - Yes? Your hospital have just rang, sir. You're wanted at once. Oh. Oh, how dreadful. Can't you just have something? Well, I... Well, I don't see why... They stressed the urgency, sir. - Oh. - Well, if you must, you must. - Yes. - Fetch the doctor's coat. - What? Oh, yes. My coat. - Thank you, sir. What a pity. We were going to have a lovely evening. Simon was getting some delicious caviar. We'll come next week. Then he can buy us all caviar. Yes. There was smoked salmon... caviar... pt de foie gras. Fresh in, too. Delicious filet de boeuf... and chicken la Kiev. - Morning, Sir Lancelot. - Good morning. - Morning, gentlemen. - Good morning, sir. - Not late, I hope. - Not at all, sir. Come along, my man. You must pursue me! - Boring cholecystectomies today? - Yes, sir. After last night, I feel like one myself. - How about that gastrectomy? - Not so well. Oh. Pity. Great pity. - Morning, Sister. Ready? - All ready, sir. Splendid. Now, lie still while I discuss your case with these young doctors. Take his pyjamas off, Sister. You. Examine his abdomen. Take that grubby fist away! The first rule of diagnosis - eyes first and most, hands next and least and tongue not at all. Look! - See anything? - No, sir. Very good. Carry on. Gently, man! You're not making bread. To be a surgeon, you need the eye of a hawk, the heart of a lion and the hands of a lady. - You found it? - Yes, sir. - Well, what is it? - A lump. - Well, what do you make of it? - Is it kidney? Is it spleen? Is it liver? Is it dangerous? Don't worry. You won't understand our medical talk. Er, you. What are we going to do about it? Erm... Cut it out, man! Cut it out! And where shall we make the incision? Nothing like large enough. Keyhole surgery! Damnable! Like this. Don't worry. This is nothing to do with you. Now, you. When we've cut through the skin, what will we find? - Subcutaneous fat, sir. - Quite right. Then we come across the surgeon's worst enemy, which is what? Speak up, man. Blood, you numbskull! You cut a patient, he bleeds, until nature forms a clot and stops it. This interval is known scientifically as the bleeding time. - You! What's the bleeding time? - Ten past ten, sir. "Ten past ten." Old Sir Lancelot blew up. Hello. Sister Virtue nearly had a baby. Hey, have you seen that little fair-haired nurse, eh? - The one watching your patients? - Yes. What about that, eh? No. It was her that winked when he asked that question - and again when he bawled me out. - Twice? You must follow that up. - I've followed up enough already. - Of course you must, mustn't he? Certainly. But you know what nurses are. They're all right for a flip but they all suffer from tinnitus. - What on earth's that? - Tinnitus? Ringing in the ears. Wedding bells. Isn't that so, Jessup? I've known young gents who got hooked before they knew what a worm was. Rubbish! Press on with her, Simon. Are you two at him again? Let him be celibate if he wants to be. - Celibate? He likes girls. - I don't want to be celibate. Then how can I pick a rugby team that's fit? - You must ask her out. - I don't even like her very much. That's not the point. It's your duty to experiment. - You can't get near a nurse. - Love laughs at sisters. Eh, Jessup? Look, there's been Rigor Mortis, the most expensive girl in the world... This is the last thing I do for you or scientific experimentation. - It's beautiful, isn't it? - All right, I suppose. I wonder where the water comes from? - The river. - Hmm? The Thames. The water probably comes from the Thames. Oh, I see. - Could we have some tea? - Yes, if you like. Well, we might as well, now we're here. All right. - You didn't want to come, did you? - Why would I ask you? - I think you were put up to it. - What a filthy thing to say. I bet the others said, "That fair nurse is interested in you." - Absolute nonsense. - They cooked it up. - No, they didn't. - Admit it. Oh... Yes, all right. In a way, they did. There. I knew it! - Why did you come, then? - I didn't know then. I thought it would be rather fun. I like going out. I rather like you. Oh, now I feel absolutely awful. Oh, don't worry about it. We all make mistakes. There's no point going on with this. I'll clear off. Oh, please don't go. Honestly, I'm terribly sorry. I like you, too. Now we know the truth, couldn't we start over again? I'm an awful clot, really. I wanted to ask you out often - but I didn't dare ask you. - Why not? You always looked so superior. You were always laughing at me. I wasn't, Simon. Honestly. - That ruddy suitcase. - Oh, that. Well, it was rather funny. I suppose it was, really. Look, let's start from scratch. We'll buy a guide and go to every place on it. - From start to finish. - Right. Come on. - You the dresser, boy? - Yes, sir. Well, get scrubbed up, then. Hurry up. - First time you've assisted? - Yes, sir. Well, don't get under my feet or I'll have your guts out. Yes, sir. Sir James Willoughby chased me out of the theatre with a scalpel - for getting under his feet. - Oh, really? And remind me to get some dry ginger. My wife will play hell if I forget again. Yes, sir. Don't forget, if you feel faint, fall backwards, not across the patient. Everybody's pampered these days, bewitched with free teeth, spectacles and psychiatrists. Good afternoon, all. All right. Let's get started. Left nephrectomy. Come here, boy. You can't learn surgery from the doorpost. Now, although it looks easy to you gentlemen, I've been doing this operation for 20 years. All right to start, Stubbins? He's a bit blue down my end but you know your own business. Sister, how the hell can I operate with this jam spreader?! Why is it that every operation I do is plagued by incompetence and blunt instruments? Don't crowd me, boy. That's much better. Hang on to your swabs. This is important. You can cut a patient's throat and nobody minds but leave anything inside, you'll be in the papers. Now for the first incision. Swab, man, swab! Have I got to do everything myself? Watching? Catch him, someone. Another Spencer-Wells, Sister. Hurry up, woman. The edge of quadratus lumborum. See it? Another clip, Sister. What happened? - He passed out. - Oh, Simon! Oh, don't be so silly. Thousands of people pass out their first time. That's right, sir. I remember Mr Willoughby when he started here. Sir James he is now. He couldn't stay on his pins for three months. - Nobody minded and look at him. - You see? I bet he didn't go out on a trolley. For heaven's sake. Have another drink and forget it. - Do you think I will make a doctor? - Yes, I do. Well, you're a jolly good nurse. In this case, anyway. - Hey, guv. - Oh, Briggs. I'm terribly sorry. - Were you looking for someone? - Er, yes, I was, actually. - Right. - Nurse! Yes, Mr Briggs, what is it? Just a minute, Mr Lodge. Nurse, he says that I've been written up for the wrong medicine. Does he? I'd better see your prescription sheet. - That seems perfectly all right. - What time does it say to take it? - Six o'clock. - Six o'clock. Any trouble here, Nurse? No, Sister. Mr Sparrow was just discussing a forthcoming operation. - You'd better go back to Mr Lodge. - Yes, Sister. And to those of you who are now entering your fifth and, let us hope, final year of your training, I would remark that if you are to master the subjects in the syllabus - anaesthetics, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology, ear, nose and throat and so on... If you are to qualify in your final examinations, you will have to use all your powers of concentration and clear-mindedness. Mmm. Hmm... Erm... do you mind if I try this on you? - No, go on. - Sure? - Comfortable? - Sure. Do you mind if I give you a whiff? - Oh, no, thank you very much! - I won't put you right out. If you put me half out, I might never get in again. - We're supposed to be practising. - I'll practise on myself. - We're in this business together. - I'm not the sleeping partner. - Simon! - Here, hold this. A- ha... I'll be late tonight. She's given me extra duty. - What's wrong with her? - I don't know. I'm off at 7:30. - Same place? - Yes. Must fly, Sister Virtue wants her tea. Taffy! Taffy! What have you been doing? Come on. Come on. Hello... Hurry up. She's screaming for that. - She's on the warpath. Hurry. - All right. Nurse Gibson! That was orange pekoe! Don't you cry, my little pretty. Never you mind. Don't you cry, my little beautiful. - Think I ever looked like that? - You still do. I'm worried about my first call. I've never had a baby before. Hey, this one's developing antisocial tendencies, I think... Yeah. Ooh! The more I read, the more I wonder why Mother Nature didn't choose a less complicated way of populating the good earth. I can't remember any of this stuff. I suppose I'll manage in practice. Stella, my flower, when we're married, we'll raise geraniums. Oh, no. We're going to have lots of children. Six or seven, I think. Six or seven? Get started on that. Hormones control the psychological manifestation of emotions and directly colour these emotions. Take the so-called emotion of love. After all, what are we? Just a collection of cells, nerve impulses, collagen fibres and hormones. - And so, of course, are women. - Mmm... Lovely. Move. For Pete's sake. I'd just got sight of her disc. I've just found her eardrum. Well, my disc is just as important as your drum. Look, that's the very first eardrum I've ever seen. Oh, any fool can see a drum, man. - Help! - It takes brains to see a disc. And what are little girls made of? # Good King Wenceslas looked out # On the Feast of Stephen # When the snow lay round about # Deep and crisp and even # Brightly shone the moon that night # Though the frost was cruel... # Christmas Eve. What a time to start midwifery. I hope no mother starts producing in the next eight hours. Don't worry, man. The people round here go in for large families, so the mother should know about it. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - You on call tonight? - Yes. - Ever had a birth before? - Not actually. The midwife will help you through. Here's your tackle. Check it before you go. - Have you got your threepence? - What for? To telephone the hospital if you get into trouble. Who's first out? - Him. - You'd better make up your minds. - Well, it's quiet, anyway. - Ha! Once it starts, they pop up like rabbits from a warren. Good hunting. - Merry Christmas. - And Merry Christmas to you, Sister. I just popped in to see how things are. - Quiet. - Yes, same in Casualty. I'm slipping up to Prudence Ward. That Night Nurse. I've been on her trail for weeks. And you said beware of nurses. This one's all right. Wants her stocking filled. Well, Christmas Eve, you know. See you later. Well, toss you for who has a baby first. Tails. Tails. It's me. - Who's that? - Benskin the Ravishing Reindeer. You startled me. What are you doing here? Bringing presents to good little girls. You be careful. Night Sister may be round. I'd brave any sister to wish you happy Christmas, you luscious little Florence Nightingale, you. Don't be silly. Would you like some cocoa? Cocoa?! I didn't come for cocoa, I came for you. Now, wish me a happy Christmas, you succulent starched uniform with a soft centre. Mr Benskin, I'll scream. Not a very loud scream. Well, I... couldn't wake the patients. Ooh... Mr Sparrow, sir? - Mr Sparrow? - What? - There's a case just come up. - Oh, Lord. Where? I've got the address here. Mrs Cooper, an old customer. This is her seventh. 23 Paradise Street. - Thank you. - What's the time? - It's zero hour. - Oh. - Good luck, man. - I think I shall need it. The bicycle's outside. Mind how you go. It's a bit temperamental until you're used to it. Taffy! Taffy! Taffy, wake up! Yes! Yes! Where's my bag? - Taffy. - Oh, I thought it was a baby. Wake up. You've got to help me. Something terrible has happened. - What's up? - That girl I popped up to see... - Yes. - Don't go to sleep! - Go away! - I was up there and feeling good, with it being Christmas Eve and her being cooperative... - Disgusting. - Eh? Well, with the soft lights and mistletoe and everything... Strike me down, before I knew where I was... I'd proposed to the woman. - Did she accept? - Accept? She said, "Yes, please." Well, congratulations. You'll make a lovely bride. Why don't you tell her it was only a joke? Be hauled up for breach of promise and kicked out of the hospital? What can I do, Taffy? It's beyond me, man. Should've stuck to football, see? - You sunbathing? - I'm going to a maternity case. - That's different, Doctor. Hop in. - Thank you. It's 23 Paradise Street. Hello, hello...? Hello. Grimsdyke? You've got to help me. - 'Who's that? ' - It's me! Benskin. Something terrible has happened... A- ha... Mmm... Mmm... I take it you're not sold on marrying this ministering angel? - Thanks. - Want a hand, Doc? - Father of twins myself. - No, thanks. - Happy Christmas. - Same to you. - Good evening. - You'll have to hurry, Doctor. She's getting near. I've got the water boiling. - Good. Is the midwife here? - No. - No. - Stuck in the snow, probably. Still, doesn't matter now you're here. Here's the doctor, love. You're a genius, old boy! That's wonderful. I'll get cracking. Thanks, old man. Bye. - We'll just have to be patient. - I'll try, Doctor. - Where's your husband? - He's asleep next door. Asleep? - Does he always sleep when...? - No, he didn't for the first three. Oh, I see. - Any sign yet, Doctor? - Not yet. Any sign of the midwife? No. I don't expect she'll get here now. - Oh. Is there a telephone nearby? - Down at the corner. - I'll pop down... - Ooh, but it's out of order. Oh... Well... You'd better boil some more water. More?! There's enough now to bath the whole of Dr Barnardo's. Grandma! Hot water. Quick! Tony. Hey, Tony! - Did you do it in time? - Just. It was a close thing, though. A very close thing, old boy. Good lad. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, girls. I've got news for you. Tony Benskin proposed to me last night and I accepted him. He gave me this. Isn't he sweet? Me, too. Well, goodbye, Mrs Cooper. You've got a jolly nice baby. The nicest one I ever had, Doctor. Thanks to you. - I didn't do much. - Oh, but you did. You made all the difference. You were so kind. I expect the doctor does hundreds every day, don't you? Well, not quite hundreds. May I... May I call him after you, Doctor? I would like to. Yes, Mrs Cooper. Certainly, if you'd like to. My name's Simon. Simon. Oh, that is a nice name. I'll call him Simon. Then he'll be reminded of you as long as he lives. Thank you, Mrs Cooper. It's a great honour. Must be wonderful to be a doctor. Yes... Yes, it must. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Doctor. - Bye, Simon. Come on, Tony. Get your shoulders down! Oh, he must get his... Never mind that, darling. Now, then, boys. Into it. Heave! They're not made of feathers! It's out! Swing the ball out to the quarter boy! That's it! Pick it up, man! Go on there, Simon! - Wonderful. - What happened? We scored, Dean. Have a swig. - Thank you. - Do you good. Come on, Bolton. Right through the timber, boy. - Congratulations. A wonderful game. - Thank you, sir. We're going to burn the ruddy gorilla! # Vio, vio, viola, viola, viola # Vio, vio, viola, vio, viola # Ich mit mein musicale, come from Schlavischland # Ich kan spieler, vosch kan spieler... # Crispins are here! # Vio, vio, viola, viola, viola # Vio, vio, viola, vio, viola... # Crispins... Quiet, everybody! Crispins are here! Crispins are here! - Crispins are here! - # Vio, vio, viola, viola, viola # Vio, vio, viola, # Vio, viola! # - Whoa! - Crispins are here! They're trying to kidnap Hubert! We'll burn the ruddy monkey! Push me in, go on, then! Not backwards! Forwards! Oh, put me down! Put me down! Let me go! Help! Put me down! Put me down! Please! Help! Help! Help! Come on! Hold it! You're pulling the church with it. Come on, fellows. Let's take the ambulance. Come on! Hurry! Hurry! Come on! - Come on, Taffy. - I'm with you. Hey, come on, fellas. You'll never catch them in that. - Come on! - I've only got two legs! - Made it! - Shut the door! Watch it, Tony. - Help! Help! - You stay down there. Hold on! Oh! Learn to drive! - Get the gorilla. - Come on. This side. It's safe. - Back to St Swithins, my boy. - Get out of the way! Hey, the police! - Are you the driver? - If you like. Come on. Come on. Nurse, ask the officer to kindly close the door. Didn't you hear the doctor? Shut the door. - Something wrong? - Urgent casualty. - A matter of life and... - Death. We must drive to the hospital. We're all going for a nice drive but not to the hospital... - Nursie, darling. - No? Students? What sort of students? - Veterinary, I presume. - Oh, no, sir. Medical, sir. Oh? Is that a medical student, too? It might well be. It has the same lofty and hygienic appearance as the rest of them. No, it's a mascot, sir. It was in this football match... Oh, it plays football, does it? On ice? No, sir. Not play, sir. It was on the touchline. Thumping its chest, bellowing "pass"? I don't understand why it was in the ambulance. Can you enlighten me? - We were rescuing it, sir. - You were the nurse? Yes, sir. Not very convincing casting, to use a theatrical expression. Well, this won't do. The court has more to occupy itself with than the rescue of gorillas in distress... stuffed or unstuffed. Have any of you anything more you wish to say? You? - No, sir. - You? - No, sir. - You are fined 40 shillings each. I have no doubt that your hospital will have more to say in the matter. It is unnecessary to say that your conduct has been unfitting for members of the medical profession. - You will agree, gentlemen. - Disgusting. You will each be fined ten pounds, and I warn you, if any of you commit the slightest breach of discipline during the rest of your time here, you will be expelled from the medical school forthwith. That is all. I will not tolerate this rowdyism. Ten quid! I can't raise that. It's twelve with the two the magistrate gave us. I've already pawned my microscope. Well, Mrs Rivington-Lomax can't help. I've just paid for the car. We're done. Pay fines in 24 hours - that's the rule. You realise, you miserable worms, that you have disgraced the hospital? Well, you've had your punishment, and richly deserved, too. In my day, they'd have thrown you out. Behaving like hooligans because we won a football match. Here, you. Take this prescription and get it filled straight away. The old so-and-so. - What's his prescription for? - Arsenic for himself, I hope. What does it say, Simon? "Pay Simon Sparrow 40 pounds - Lancelot Spratt." Stella, my little flower, would you give me a long, lingering kiss? - No. - Why? - I'm reading. - What? A pamphlet about Spain. About Spain? Why? I think I might go there. What for? You'll never be a doctor, ever. You should be studying for your final exams and all you do is lie on that sofa and dream. Nonsense. The finals aren't for ages yet. The finals are in exactly four weeks. Tony! Taffy! - The finals are in four weeks! - Four weeks! Four weeks! I'm sunk, man. Holy cats! Where are my notebooks? Joy, tell me the answer, please. - Don't you know? - No. - Guess. - I can't. Go on. Tell me, please. All right. Six grains for three doses, followed by three grains for two days, and half that dose for two days. - I'll never pass. - Of course you will. I'll ask you something else. What are the signs and symptoms of pink disease? I didn't know there was such a thing. Joy? - Yes? - I've been thinking. If I do qualify, I shan't be seeing so much of you, shall I? - No, I suppose not. - Are you always going to be a nurse? I expect so. Is a presystolic murmur diagnostic of mitral stenosis? Yes. It would be funny if we met some time in a hospital and we were both old, and you were a matron, and I was a Harley Street specialist. Yes. You'd better ask me something else. - Do you mind doing this? - Of course I don't mind. What is the treatment for...? - What's it striking? - What? Quarter to. I haven't got a late pass. I must dash! I'll come with you. - What's the time? - Three minutes past. - I'll have to get over the roof. - I'll help you. - Good night. - Good night. See you in the wards, and don't worry about the exam. Good night. ...it's a question for the governors. Until they give a decision, our hands are completely tied. I agree, but we could hurry them up. Well, you know what governors are. - What was that? - One of those cats, I should think. Matron, about that meeting... Hey! Help! Help! There's a man in my room! Oh! - Sister Virtue! - Mr Sparrow! Good of you to drop in. - I slipped. - You certainly did, Mr Sparrow. Simon! Simon, are you all right? Oh, Nurse Gibson, won't you join us? - Oh! - Oh! You know that it is against the rules of the medical school for a student to enter the nurses' home on any pretext. Yes, sir. I didn't actually mean to enter them, sir. That is, to say the least, questionable, as you were with one of the inmates. And anyway, the roof is equally out of bounds. Is it not? - Yes, sir. - Your conduct was incompatible with that required of a future doctor. You are expelled forthwith from the medical school. - But, sir, I... - That's all, Mr Sparrow. Wait a minute, boy. I say, Dean. I know rules are rules but he hasn't done the girl any harm, and it's just before his finals. He should have considered that before. Oh, but medical students are medical students, not choirboys. Besides, he's the finest rugby player we've had. I am dean of a medical school, not a football manager. No, I'm afraid my decision is irrevocable, Sir Lancelot. Parrish, do you remember when we were students? There was a terrific rag one term after some match. - There were plenty. - I'm reminded of one particular one, where someone led a horse into the nurses' home. Oh, I remember. It was a large white one, wasn't it? - Well, it was large. - That's it. - This is irrelevant. - He got a nurse to play Lady Godiva and ride around the courtyard. - She did, bless her. - Who was it? I can't remember. I expect I'm the only person who hasn't forgotten. - I remember who it was. - Sir Lancelot... Pity these stories should die. I think I'll tell that one to the students as light relief. They'd love it, especially if they knew who was involved. Who was it? Do remind me, I... Oh, yes. I remember now. Yes, that story would be quite sensational if it got around. Just what I was thinking. Mr Sparrow, would you wait outside? Well, he sacked me, then they started talking about horses or something. Then he said he'd changed his mind and fined me ten quid and the cost of the skylight. - What happened to you? - It was extraordinary. I was in Sister Virtue's office waiting, and the phone went. She answered, talked for a bit, then went white. I thought she'd pass out. Then she hung up and said this time, she'd overlook it. - Who was on the phone? - It sounded like Sir Lancelot. - What did he say? - I thought I heard "Lady Godiva". - Mmm? - Lady Godiva. Sit down, my boy. Sit down. Don't waste time. Now, do you know which mosquitoes transmit disease to man? Malaria. The female anopheline mosquito. Yes, a theory first postulated in 1894 by Sir Patrick Manson. Manson... I remember him well. Charming man. Charming. We met at the BMA meeting in 1914... or was it '13? Well, it might have been '19. Now, how do you diagnose malaria? Erm... Spleen? Yes, that's right. Oh, very good, my boy. Very good. Your question. What is the commonest cause of acute heart failure? Shock, sir. Severe shock. Now, my lad. Take a look in there and tell me what you can see. Be careful. Those things cost money. Well, what is it? - Trichinosis, sir. - What? It's some kind of worm. I can't quite recognise them. Worms? Perhaps if you removed your tie from the field of vision, it would help. Sorry, sir. That would be the worms turning, I presume. Well, my boy. Where do you come from? St Swithins, sir. Number 306. Right. Now, you see these screens? Well, behind these are ladies and gentlemen who volunteered to be prodded around by you blighters, so you can tell us what's wrong. You go to number ten, make a thorough diagnosis, and I'll come along and see what you've rooted out. - Hello, guv'nor. - Briggs! What are you doing here? - How's that little nurse? - Fine. I thought we'd cured you. I've got new things now. Beautiful mess, I am. I'm their most interesting case for years. I've got thyro... - I've got to find out myself. - Don't interrupt. Thyrotoxicosis, thrombophlebitis obliterans, tremors of the fingers, - loss of weight, palpitations... - Shut up. Be quiet. - Ribs, sir. - What's wrong with them? - Empyema, sir. - Mm-hmm. And that? - Femur, sir. - Anything the matter? - Erm... osteomyelitis, sir? - Mm-hmm. Would you mind? And that? Well, come on. Come on. Come on. Sir, it looks like pickled gherkins. And this? There's thyrotoxicosis. The symptoms are loss of weight... - Yes. ...tremors of the fingers... - Yes. ...and he complains of palpitations. - Any auricular fibrillation? - No. No auricular fibrillation. Excellent. Excellent. And what's the treatment? Well, er... - Well? - Operation. Partial thyroidectomy. Splendid. Splendid. My dear sir, I'm glad you're teaching surgery at St Swithins at last. This fellow gave a first-rate diagnosis. Really? Good afternoon, Mr Briggs. We've met before, haven't we? He's a bright lad. Sorry you didn't hear him. So am I. Perhaps he would diagnose another case? Well, er... one's the rule. I'm sure Mr Sparrow wouldn't mind being an exception to the rule. Oh, very well. He's a pleasure to listen to. See what you make of the case next door, my lad. It's a real stinker. Next, whoever you are! Come on. Don't keep me hanging about here all day. Right. I'm a jolly young woman, 23 next birthday, and I complain of putting on weight. What do you do? May one ask if you are jolly in an attractive way, sir? I wouldn't waste my time being knock-kneed with a squint. Well, then, I should send you to an antenatal clinic. Oh, good heavens, man. If you send every pretty woman to an ante-natal clinic, you won't stay in practice long. - St Swithins? - Yes, sir. I thought so. You all have one-track minds. All right. I'm a year-old baby and I'm brought to you with a pain in the tummy and yelling blue murder. Waaah! Well? I'd ask if there was anything missing, sir? - What sort of thing? - Well, for example, a doorknob. A doorknob! More likely to be a knob off the television set nowadays. Well, what would the symptoms be? All right. I've swallowed a doorknob. What would my symptoms be? Well, I should say mild indigestion. You would, would you? What are you going to do? Give me castor oil and hope? No, sir. Locate the object and remove it. I should ruddy well think so. And how would you locate the object? I hope the X-ray department would help, sir. - We're on a desert island. - There wouldn't be a doorknob. Nonsense. I sell doorknobs and I've saved my samples from the wreck. Well, where would it be? Well... in the oesophagus, sir, or the stomach, or the duodenum or the jejunum. - Do you know where the jejunum is? - Below the stomach, sir. Is the object a long-distance runner? - Do you know where the caecum is? - Yes, sir. - All right. Show me. - Yes. - There. - It won't bite you, boy. - Where? - In there, sir. All right. I said show me, not tear it out with your bare hands. It's by Mcburney's point. Where's that? - Mcburney's point, sir? - Yes. Do you know? - It's slipped my memory, sir. - It's no business to. Supposing I got to a man's appendix by cutting off his feet because I'd forgotten where it was. Mcburney's point, you ignoramus... Take your coat off. I'll show you. - Go on, take your coat off! - Yes, sir. Great heavens alive, man. - What on earth is that? - A waistcoat, sir. You have the effrontery to face the examiners like that?! In all my years, I've never seen anything like it. Thank you, sir. I've never seen anything like it either. Rather fewer than usual. The standard's definitely dropping. People say that every year. I failed three times myself. Doesn't mean a thing. Here, let's have a look. - What, him? - Mmm... - And him? - Yes. - Not him?! - No! And him? Well, it's a good job there aren't exams for elderly eminent surgeons, otherwise, I should have to take up the other kind of butchery. Here, Jessup. Let them have it. Hello. Hello. Ah, Dr Evans! Why so gloomy? You passed. Got a job, too, I hear. Oh, yes. Assistant medical officer in a prison. - A woman's prison, too. - Oh! I start work at Holloway on Monday, so it's goodbye to this. - I'm sorry you failed. - Bad show. - How's it coming on, Taffy? - Fine. Yeah. I've got a date. New nurse. Real smasher. - Next term should be all right. - Well, good luck. - Grimsdyke, when does Stella leave? - I don't. I thought if you failed, she was leaving. She was, but since I started working, she got interested in the noble art. She joins me as a student next term. Oh, goody-goody! I'll be a doctor's husband. Wonderful! - You get all the luck. - Luck? That's long-term planning. - Mrs Rivington-Lomax. - Mrs Rivington-Lomax. Dr Sparrow? Dr Sparrow, sir, a message from Dr Stewart. He says will you take over in Casualty. He's been called out. I'm sorry. Oh, I've forgotten my stethoscope. Anybody got one? - I won't be long. - Good luck, Simon. Simon. - Hmm? - Good luck. Oh, thank you. I've collected rather a lot of these. Do you mind taking some back for me? What a shame. Your first night as a doctor. Yes, I suppose it'll always be like this now. - Blimey, a doctor. - Do you feel different? Yes, I do, rather. I've suddenly realised a lot of things. - A lot. Joy, I... - Yes, Simon? Dr Sparrow? - Will you wait for me? - Yes, I'll wait. Thanks.
