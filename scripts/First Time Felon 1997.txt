Because this is your first offense, pending qualification... ...you will be given a choice to serve an alternative sentence... ...under the jurisdiction of the prison boot camp program. This shit's a fucking joke. You did what you did and now you got to pay. You think you can do whatever you want and get away with it? Five years for my first offense? That's bullshit there, Mama. What about this boot camp? l don't know. l heard it's out in the middle of nowhere. Guards yelling at you, telling you to do pushups. Like the army.

Peter Jackson? -Yeah. -Let's go! -All right, player, stay up. -You do what you got to do now. Ta-dow. You're dead, motherfucker! -Fuck you, bitch-ass nigger. -Hear me? You're dead! -Fuck you. -You're dead! -Stuttering-ass bitch! -Dead, motherfucker! Shit. What the fuck you looking at? My uncle, he owns a used-car lot on Western.

No, ma'am!'' -You scum understand that? -Yes, sir! -l can't hear you! -Yes, sir! Everybody turn around and face me! Do l look like your friend? What is your first name, fat boy? Your first name is ''inmate!'' What is your first name? ''lnmate,'' sir! -Do you think this is funny, moron? -No, sir. -Wipe that smile off your face, inmate. -l can't, ma'am. Get him out of here! Let's go, come on! See how funny the penitentiary is? Dummy! One down... ...17 to go. Guards! Everybody else, move out! l'm Superintendent Sorley. From this point forward, you will take no actions on your own. You will do absolutely nothing... ...unless you are instructed to by a member of this staff. -Do you understand that? -Yes, sir! You have no reason to say anything to the inmate standing next to you. You are all here alone. lf after 120 days, you all decide you wanna call each other up... ...and talk about all the good times you had while you were here, that's fine. But while you are here, no talking. Ever. Any time, any place... ...ever. This program is unfair. lt was designed to be unfair. Life is unfair. -Do you understand that? -Yes, sir! Now, there will be no escapes. lf you try to escape, we will apprehend you. We'll hunt you down like the animals that you are and after you are caught... ...you will get seven to 10 years added to whatever time you're doing. -Do you understand that? -Yes, sir! You're all non-violent first-time felons. Sentences between two and five years. Now, all of you, each and every-- Stand up. You put your eyes on me again, l will pop them right out of your head. Yes, sir! My staff will not lay a hand on you. And you will not lay a hand on my staff. Anyone who takes a swing at one of my staff members... ...will then cease to be an inmate and will become a convict. And believe me... ...we know how to deal with convicts here. This program exists solely to make room in our over-crowded prison system... ...and to save taxpayers' dollars. That is all we have to do. lt is not our job to straighten you out. lt is your job. lt is your responsibility. Move out! -What are you in for? -Car theft, ma'am. -Are you a drunk driver? -No, ma'am. You run over old ladies while they get in your way? Why are you wasting my time? -Get out of my chair! -You sold my sister heroin? -No, sir. -Why, my sister ain't good enough? -No, sir. -What? What? What is this? Pick it up! -What's your last name, you idiot? -Buber, ma'am. -Ever attempt suicide? -No, ma'am. You're sure, with a name like ''Boob''? You sure look like an idiot to me. -Yes, ma'am. -You're a real piece of work, idiot. Shot... ...stabbed. What's that? Bite mark, ma'am. -Who bit you, you idiot. Your girlfriend? -Yes, ma'am. Being mean to her? Probably deserved it. A look at your body and your secret's out, Sims. We both know you don't belong here! Ma'am, l have a bullet in my back. -Now? lt's in your back now? -Yes, ma'am, right here. That's just great.

Keep looking straight ahead, dummy! Everybody! Prepare to mount! Mount! Sleep! Fuck Calhoun! Everybody on their feet! -Who wants to fuck Calhoun? You? -No, no, sir. -You wanna fuck Calhoun? -No, sir. How about you? -You wanna fuck Calhoun? -No, sir! No talking ever! That means never! Maybe we should be able to say whatever we want to... ...in language they understand. lf they can't take it in here without losing control... ...how are they gonna make it in the street where it'll be 10 times worse? Yes, but within limits. We have our boundaries and one of them is no cursing. That's not what they understand, Captain. l know what these kids understand! l grew up with kids like this. We must be so much worse than the street to them. lf you get them early and just hit them hard! You can't hit them so hard that you demoralize them. You've gotta give them some respect and some space to come up. These kids are not from your neighborhood. They're not going back to your neighborhood. How about you? Help the ones you can help... ...and l'll work with the ones you can't. You know what l think? You should project your voice from down here. lt's easier on your throat. You wear white because you are ghosts. Ghosts do not exist. As you have been told, your milk cartons face front! Do it! And your plate touches the tray! Do it! You'll have exactly 10 minutes in which to finish your food. At-- Did you hear what l said, numb-nuts? Milk carton faces front! Get up, Yance! Get up! You'll eat standing.

Sir, l said that l don't believe-- -You think this is the Cub Scouts, moron? -No, sir, l don't think-- You think if you keep cryin', l'll send you home to your mama and daddy? You quit me now... ...and l'm gonna ship your butt right back to prison, dummy! Right now, understand? ls that what you want? -ls that what you want? -Yes, that's exactly what l want, sir! l quit, sir, l quit! Get out of my face, quitter. Go on, move, loser! Pack your gear and get a move on! Man, this shit here fucked up! They got some dicks in here! l been thinking. We have the wrong approach. -What?

And l ain't going back to no motherfucking prison! When we get back on the streets we do what we gotta do. Motherfucking straight! Seem to me we got to work together. Unless we ain't never gonna get no sleep. -What's your name, partner? -Tyrone. Greg. l'll put it to you like this here, player. We peace this shit out, we be outta here by July. Be back on the streets by summertime! Won't see none of these bitch-ass motherfuckers no more. Can make some money, get some clothes, take care of some business. Goddamn, it sound good to me.

All right. Experts report that the Midwest can expect some of the worst flooding in years, Heavy rains continue to swell the Mississippi River,,, ,,,to the highest levels seen in years, Closer to home, no rain is expected in this small Iowa River town,,, ,,,but residents decided to spend the weekend sandbagging the local levee,,, ,,,in hopes of avoiding the heavy flooding,,, ,,,which their neighbors to the north have been battling for the last week, This is the worst flooding the Midwest has seen in over 50 years. And right now the National Guard is spread so thin... ...that the governor has asked for our help. This is a perfect opportunity for us... ...to show what this program and our men are all about. River broke through right here at Davenport. Flooded 25,000 acres of farmland. Right now, Davenport is 15 feet underwater. Fifteen-thousand people have lost their homes and been evacuated. -You got any questions? -No, sir. Sir, l don't think our unit is really ready to deal with a situation like this. Those are the orders. Our men are gonna help with this flood. And l'll tell you, they're gonna do a damn good job. All right, let's get it. This is the perfect challenge for these inmates. Just the kind of positive publicity this program needs. -lt's gonna be great for these kids. -lt'll be great for some of these kids. Some of these other kids will finish this program and be back on the street... ...doing the same thing that got them here in the first place. Or worse. And tell me, Captain. What is it gonna do for this program if one of these kids assaults a farmer? Or worse yet, touches some white girl in that town? That is not gonna happen. These are non-violent felons. Ten years ago, these first-time kids would've just been given probation. The same way first-time rich white kids still are. Those white kids you're talking about, they got nice homes and nice parents. You can be sure they won't allow their kid to get caught a second time. These men don't come from those neighborhoods! And the last thing they need is somebody telling them that their race is an excuse! This program believes that young men can change. -Are you with the program, Officer? -Yes, l am, ma'am. All right. Got a mighty long time on this here land, Got a mighty long time on this here land, I can't have me a woman, so I use my hand, I can't have me a woman, so I use my hand, All right, people, hands on your hips! -One! -Down! Up! -Two! -Down! Up! Three! Yance! Get over here! What's the matter with the rest of you people? Get those hands down! You think this is a joke? You still wanna be gangbang around here? No, sir. l saw what you just did. -That wasn't no gangbang-- -Who told you to talk without permission? You think the rules are for everybody but you? That's what got your little butt here in the first-- Tom, l'll take him to the storage room for a few minutes. You make sure l'm not disturbed? You follow me, Miss Yance. Straight ahead. Take your hat off. You know you're the enemy, Yance? You don't know that, do you? l'll bet your black ass doesn't even know there's a war going on. And l'm not talking about the war on crime and drugs. l'm talking about the war between Black people... ...and niggers. That's what you are, Yance. You a motherfucking nigger. Let me tell you something. God, l hate niggers. l love Black people. Honest, hardworking, law-abiding Black people. Niggers like you make me sick. There's no problem for a nigger to get his own people hooked on drugs. Got the girls on the corner turning $5 tricks. No problem for a nigger to shoot another nigger. No problem for a nigger to rob and steal... ...from good, honest, hardworking Black people. That's what they want. You're doing their work for them. You know what's so fucked up about that? You look at me and you call me an ''Uncle Tom?'' You are the Uncle Tom! You fucking joke! You are the real enemy of Black people. White people look at me, it kills me that they see you... ...'cause there ain't but one nigger in this here closet. You been here this long and you gonna try to run a game on me? This here is where the game ends. l don't believe you're ever gonna have a home. Or have a half-decent job. Or get an education. Or even have a family worth a shit. You know why? Do you know why? Because you're happy just to be a motherfucking nigger. The clock is ticking, son. You have no time. l don't believe you'll make it through that motherfucking flood. Get out. When l get outta here... ...l'm gonna come back down here and smoke Calhoun. Yeah? Well, l'll posse with you. Motherfucker talking all kinds of crazy shit. He the type of motherfucker hate his own damn race. Call me a nigger. That's the type of nigger right there. Gotta say ain't nothing but an Uncle Tom. Yeah. Yes, sir. Yes, he is. A staggering amount of the Midwest is underwater tonight,,, ,,,as the deadly Mississippi continues to rush southward,,, ,,,destroying everything in its path, It's official, folks, This is the worst flood to hit the Midwest in 100 years, As one exhausted volunteer put it, all you can do is hope for the best, All right, off the bus and fall in! Let's go! Move, move, move! Rednecks. Confederate flag under them damn sandbags. Sims, give me 50! -Mary McBride, Dept. of Corrections. -Civil Defense, welcome aboard. Thank you. Might not look too bad on a nice day like this. A hundred miles north of here, it's raining like hell. We're gonna get the full brunt of that when it rolls down here. The crest is already rising fast. We'll have to raise this whole bank ...or we'll lose 1,500 acres of crops, and the whole town of Niota. Okay. All right, l wanna see those sandbags move. Let's go, team. Go, go! Let's make those sandbags fly through the air. Let's go! What the hell is this? l ain't working with these people! You talking about my men? How we supposed to work with one hand on our wallet? Military don't work with convicts. l didn't realize a yearly camp-out made you fellas military. You're just a prison guard. You got no say over us. You just keep the criminals away from us. -Where you from, Guardsman? -Kentucky. How's about l just kick your ass all the way back to Paducah? Let's move those bags! Let's show these people, man. Move those bags! Come on, let's go, come on. Come on! Work those bags, come on!

That fish of yours stinks. This here is catfish. This is soul food. Excuse me. You men have done a fantastic job today. -Y'all eat up. -Thank you, ma'am. -There's plenty more. -Okay, ma'am. lf you don't want it, l might as well help myself. You're insulting these people who made this meal with your lack of manners. Your meal is done, boy. You get outside, you wait outside. And you're next. We will not break discipline, gentlemen. We will not. Understood? And we will not eyeball me, Yance. Get out, you, too. Go, get out! That means now, Yance. Go, now! Do we have a problem? Okay, we all have a problem. Everybody, get the hell out. l'll teach you goddamn fools! All right, men, you have been disciplined. Now go back and finish your meal! They need to eat to keep their strength up. You embarrassed them in front of the whole town! l know you have your agenda and l respect that, but you go too far! One more time and l will see to it that you are suspended. -Don't worry about your town, -Don't worry about your town, -We ain't gonna let you down, -We ain't gonna let you down, -Pick you up and turn you around, -Pick you up and turn you around, -You must be thirsty after all that work. -Thank you, ma'am. l'd work all day with this fresh air out in the wilds. -ln ''the wilds?'' -Wilderness. Whatever you wanna call it. lt's beautiful. Where l come from you can't even breathe. The buildings cramp you in so. Nothing like this. All these beautiful trees, fresh air. Hey, everybody! Grandview is underwater! lt's headed your way! Sharon's got a sister in Grandview. lf you don't mind me asking, sir... ...what would happen if this town floods? Well, the bolt factory outside town will definitely flood. Sharon works there. Most people here do. They'll all lose their jobs. People's homes... ...they'd be ruined. No home, no job. Families will have to move. The town just won't be the same. -l'm gonna call you ''nature boy''. -Those frogs eat them damn mosquitoes. This air out here is straight. -Got some decent people, too. -For crackers. They're people just like you and me. So, what you saying? -We need to save this damn town. -Yeah, do some good work. Come back down here, work on a damn farm. That right? l'll ride the tractor. Put a spoiler on it. -Yo, Greg. -What's happening, player? What will we do when we get back on the streets? Shit, man. l'm just trying to do what l got to do, you know? You know l'm Disciple, and you... ...you still Vice Lord. Shit. Listen here, dude. -l'm just trying to live my life. -One life to live, huh? Ta-dow. Ta-dow. Hey, dude, you ain't moving nothing. This is how. Sims! Get over here! After 3 inches of rain last night, flood waters destroyed main levees,,, ,,,40 miles north of Niota, Niota's in a bad place. When the flood passes this curve, it's gonna hit us hard. -You have children? -Yes, sir, two boys. -You a free man in what, two weeks? -Eight days, sir. How'd you get involved in the drug business? -Did your mother sell drugs? -My mother didn't sell no drugs, sir. Okay, what about your father? l don't know! Where is your father? He still alive? l don't know, sir. -l'm just asking. What's your excuse, son? -Ain't no excuse here. Don't bullshit me. There's always some excuse. ''My family was poor, l didn't have no father. ''My mother was turning tricks.'' lt doesn't stop with you, your mother and father. You got children of your own and they're watching you. And if your kids say: ''My daddy is a gangbanger, my daddy is a drug dealer.'' You're giving your kids the perfect excuse. Don't talk about my kids! You're gonna go get a gun and shoot me 'cause l dissed you, huh? -Just don't talk about my kids. -Put your goddamn hand down, boy. -What about the mother of your children? -Don't even talk about her! l'll teach my kids! Teach your kids what, boy? How to be a gangbanger? How to sell a $5 vial of crack cocaine? You leave that man alone!

Remember my homeboy, Alex? -He dead. -Yeah? Carl got shot. He dead. He was in boot camp like you. Went back to hustling.

Yeah, me neither. Hey, whip out the cream. -Welcome back, player. -Good to be back, my man. Boss Dog. Ta-dow. -Be safe, man. -Yeah, man. Stay up. ''With warmest thanks from your Niota family. You'll never be forgotten. ''Signed, Sharon.'' She was the cook. They sent pictures. See, there's the church we used to eat in. Oh, every day was like Thanksgiving, boy. They had this catfish, used to fry it whole without the head. lt was good. Wasn't nothing as good as your cooking though, Mama. People was thanking us every day, thanking us for this, thank you for that. We had a cadence we used to sing. Y'all wanna hear it? Yeah. Please? -Could we please hear the song? -Come on, let's hear it. ''They say in Niota, the people's mighty fine. ''Feed us twice a day, so now you're friends of mine. ''Oh, won't let you flood, 'cause there's lots of love. ''Ooh, ooh, ooh, hya!'' Y'all in jail wasn't singing about no love. We was. lf you were there, you'd have been singing, too. l know they didn't have no fish like mine. But it's nice they sent you that card. My mama had an interview with her boss. You were never in. You didn't get back to me. l couldn't get the anklet turned off... -...they had to cancel the interview-- -Who's that? Give me the phone. Yes, is this his parole officer? Ma'am, why can't my son ever get a hold of you? And why can't he go to the library and get some books? He likes to read and he wants to do some job research. You don't want him to get into trouble? He had discipline... ...and a lot of activity at boot camp. He came back all gung ho. Now you force him to be idle for four months? Don't you think that's a little counterproductive-- Thank you. There it is. Ta-dow. Hey yo, Boss Dog! What's up, player? Yo, come here, man! -So you out, huh? -Yeah. Let's take this ride, player. Yo, l just got this anklet off. l only got two hours. l'll drop you off. Why you tripping? Come on, man. Trick or treat, motherfucker. -This is my nigger, Boss Dog. -What's up, man?

Damn, she's slamming. -That thing can't do shit with speed. -l show you what this motherfucker can do. -Bring it on, goddammit. -Let me go. -Watch this bitch. -Ta-dow. Why you ain't go with them? Why go with them when l could be here with you? Why you ain't call me? l don't know. l hear things. You think l was gonna wait? -Just saying you didn't write me-- -l don't write no one. Your hair looks different. You like it? lt's pretty. People say you think you better than everybody else now. You ain't down like you was. You wanna be just another fool can't get no job. Do l look like a fool? l gotta go. Can't be seen with a nigger with no money? Straight out, Greg? l'm the same, even if you ain't. l'm the same, too. Just ain't hustling, that's all. l gotta get my hair done. Feels lighter. They're long, but they were on sale. l got you some shoes. They're durable. A nice white shirt. Ta-dow. ''Now's the time for something new ''There ain't nothing you can't do'' You tell them the truth, straight out. Don't hide nothing. Think positive. Look at yourself. -What are you looking for? -Anything. What kind of salary? Minimum wage, anything. What was your last job? Burger King. -When was that? -'91. What've you been doing since? l've been in a boot camp for young men headed down the wrong road. What did you get arrested for? Selling drugs. l completed my high school GED with honors. l also have a recommendation from the superintendent of the boot camp. What kind of drugs did you sell? Heroin. Why don't you try back in about a week? Thank you very much. lf you have any openings, my number's on the application. Thank you. l was wondering if you needed any help. Maybe in the kitchen. l could wash dishes, be a short-order cook. l'll do anything. l don't need any help. Part-time, full-time, no-time. Thank you. -Can't get nothing. -Just a goddamn nigger to them. They don't want you to open the door for them, messenger for them... ...pour their watery-ass coffee for them, nothin'. That's why l ain't gonna drag my ass down to no motherfucking job interview... ...and ask them for some bullshit they ain't never gonna give me. They give the sisters work. That's cool. They ain't gonna give me no mop to slop their shit with. l don't have your fucking money. Man, ain't one brother out here got a job. My homeboy, Lovell. He down there at the Hyatt Regency making about $6.40 an hour. He ain't never been in prison, man. He ain't got no arrest sheet. Out of all the motherfuckers you begged to give you a shit job, was there one brother? Hell, no. Not one goddamn nigger got a job to give us. Check out Jason's brother. He owns that funeral parlor. Only legit business around that makes money. l already did, dog. Got a motherfucking waiting list. -Believe that shit? -That's bullshit. -Fucking waiting list at a funeral parlor. -Straight up, man. You know you always got a job with me, right? Hey, bitch! Motherfucker, l'm tired of your ass! What's up, boss, my man? l heard you was out. Didn't even try to contact me? What's up with that? l heard you squaring up on me. How your job search? -lt's all right. -You got a job? Ain't all right, then. l hate to see you like this, homey. How much longer can you take this poor-man shit? Who's paying your health for you? Getting over on your mom? -She pick out your clothes for you, too? -l don't work for you no more. l ain't asking you for shit. Matter of fact, get the fuck outta my face. Damn, l didn't know it was bad as all that. You'll be all right. Gorgeous, come here. What's up, Greg? Tell you what, let me know when you wanna work just one day. Put some papers in your pocket, me and you can go out and kick it. l gotta tell you, don't look like you had yourself no fun in a long goddamn time. You have to hang in there. What you think l been doing? l been out every day, all day... ...looking for a job, any kind of job, for three months now. l haven't had an interview in two weeks. -Ain't nobody wanna hire me. -Something will come up. Mama, this ain't the '70s. You can't just walk out there and get a job. Ain't nobody gonna hire me unless l tell 'em l been to college or.... l know guys never been to prison and still can't get a job. They catch you lying and that's it. This is it now, don't you understand? l'm a grown man and l live with my mama! l can't get a damn job! You think l wanna be here? This is it. This is bullshit! All of it, it's bullshit! Wait a minute. ''Bullshit?'' This... ...what you just did, is bullshit. This is who you are. This is what you accomplished. Now, you go and get what's yours. You're a man. A man like who? Who you trying to be like, baby? Like your father? l'm not gonna let you be the man your father was. l don't need another dead man. l am not gonna have you give up and die on me, too, goddammit. l am not going to let you die. This is what we're gonna do. Now... ...you're gonna go down there to them employment people again. You're gonna look them in the eye... ...and you're gonna tell them the truth. Step up, baby... ...and tell them who you are. You are Greg Yance... ...and you are not going to die. Can l tell you about my experience down there? l worked 18 hours a day... ...for $3 a week. Throwing sandbags from dawn to dusk. Stepping in water with snakes and all types of insects l never seen before. We worked in 110-degree heat. Uniform soaked. Feet blistered, hands raw, mosquito bites all over my body. After we finished, we'd still have to do our P.T., that's physical training. Stomach crunches and pushups and jumping jacks. Then we'd still have to jog three miles a day. l know that may sound like a nightmare to you, but.... Throwing sandbags on that levee was the best job l've ever had. The people there... ...they made us feel like we had a purpose. We made a difference and they thanked us. l'm a hard worker, l like backbreaking work. l work good with my hands. l'll work on the outside and start at the bottom. Making $3 an hour would be a very big accomplishment for me. l'm just asking you. Please, could you look for anything? Just anything. l'm willing to work. l'm sorry, we just don't have anything for you right now. What's wrong? You tripping me out. Shit, ain't nothing, everything just going in slow motion. -You know something? -What's that? For a minute, l thought l wouldn't end up hustling for the rest of my life. For me, there ain't nothing else. Especially seeing what your ass is going through. Shit. When you wanna start? lf nothing come through by next week.... Monday. What's going on? -What's up? -What's up, Pookie? All right. You know that motherfucker? -l thought you knew the nigger! -l don't know that motherfucker. Let's get the fuck outta here, man. Pookie, check this out. Snitchin' bitch! That'll shut your fat fucking mouth. You see anything? -Tell me you saw something, motherfucker. -You got it, dog. You a snitch, too? No.
