Marie! If you find your gent charge him up a grand. Tell him it's gone up. Tell him everything's going up! Keep me Marian... This way! Here! Over here! This is the testament of Dr. Henry Jekyll. Age 30, male. Male... Male! I must set this down before it is too late. It all began on the November last... That grey and fateful day when I was visited by my dearest friend and colleague, professor Robertson. Oh! - Allow me. - That's very kind of you. It's my pleasure. Er... Which way? - Oh, please don't bother. I'm going to that house over there. My, a happy coincidence! So am I. Robertson, professor Robertson. How do you do? I'm Susan Spencer. And this is my brother, Howard. How do you do? This gentleman has kindly assisted me. - Most kind... but, we can manage from here. Well, you said you could manage. Thank you. My dear Doctor Jekyll, you work yourself far too hard. Only last night I passed here, well after midnight, and your light was still burning. I was working. What were you doing at that hour? - No, I was on the job too. Research, you know? Delicious blonde fragment from the chorus of the Alhambra. Come now, professor. Research? - Oh! Certainly a great benefit to the mankind. Well... To a small section of it, ten-a-rate. - And what will you have to show for it? The pox? I sincerely hope not. Well, if you do, perhaps my researches will help you. Antivirus. The universal panacea. One virus to combat perhaps 20 diseases. How far have you got? - Oh, not far... I admit it's early days, naturally... But, I have produced a virus strain which will provide some imunity against it, theoria. And when that's perfected, I'll tackle another disease. Cholera, perhaps... Robertson? Ah... Yes! Yes, very commendable. You seem to be acquiring a very interesting new neighbour. Professor... - Though, I was listening... My eyes were diverted but my ears were yours. So... An antivirus? To protect us against a myriad of diseases. Now, tell me... Just how long before you expect some results? - Well, I'll have provided more complete imunity against it, theory, whithin a year or two. A year or two? And then, what? Cholera? - Yes. - Another year or two... And then, typhus... Another year or two... And then, typhoid, and influenza. And yellow fever... Oh, my dear Jekyll, that's race to be forty or fifty eaten before you've completed the experiment. - Oh, it's a long process, I agree... But, the point is... - Point is you'll be dead and burried long before it's finished. A chance remark from Robertson that sparked off this whole evil affair. A remark remained and festered in my mind. I had no mind, no will for work. I walked the streets brooding upon the bitter irony that all I wanted to do for humanity, for life... Would be cheated by death. Unless, I could cheat death. The thought took shape in my mind. Suddenly, it was clear to me what I must do. I decided to explore a new avenue... An elixir of life. The secret of eternal youth. A secret that had fascinated and eluded men for centuries. But, they have sought it through witchery, black magic and superstitious nonsense... But I had science at my fingertips. I saw it as the first step in an exciting scientific adventure. I could not know then that it was the first step towards the black abbyss, towards a myriad of horrors, towards self-destruction. I was seized and engulfed by the idea. Became my passion and my obsession. I worked without stop. Days and night passed without meaning for me. I was utterly heedless of the outside world. What does it so fascinate you outside that window, Susan? Susan, your brother is talking to you. - I was wondering what you were looking at. - Nothing. Or at least, nothing yet. - A riddle, this must be a riddle. - Sorry... What I actually meant was, I haven't seen Doctor Jekyll. - You mean the young man who lives below us? Oh, why should you have seen him? - No reason. It's just that I'm sure he hasn't been out of his room in past five days. Why should that concern my little sister? It seems odd, don't you think? - Why, I think he's remarkably dilligent. And that's Doctor Jekyll's reputation. He's a dedicated man. A good man. There he goes. - Where? There. You see? There's your precious Doctor Jekyll. What do you think of him now, mamma? Where can he be going at this ungodly hour? Hope you're not going to chose her... I'm kind of fond of her... This one. She's not so much of a choise. Oh, I'll be outside then, till you want me. And, uh... Just call. Although it's you. Pop potatoes! They're 10 pence. Lovely yot. Pop potatoes! Lovely pop potatoes! Berries, wine, myrtles! Handsome? Never! I don't believe it. - I tell you he is. Handsome! A fine face. But, so tired... So very tired. And young too, he's much younger than I imagined. - That sinister Doctor Jekyll? - There's nothing sinister about him at all. Nothing! - Of course, there isn't. Howard, you mustn't tease us so. I've met Doctor Jekyll myself, I should think he's rather a nice young man. At last! At last! - Come in. What time is it? - Well, don't mind the time. What have you been up to? Glad to get to see you since Wednesday. And you were here. There's no use denying it. - Wednesday? Did you say Wednesday? What day is it now? - Saturday, of course. Really, my dear chap. You must try... Saturday? I've been asleep... three days. I don't wonder at it. And what I can make out, you worked without stop for ten days. Three days! Three days! - Don't go on like this, you know. Spare some air! Get some fruit inside you. Yes, yes... I will, dear Robertson. I'm going to show you this. Here. Do you recognize this species? Of course. What's it's life cycle? A few hours, no more. - Robertson, this insect, which normally dies within an hour or two of it's birth... ... has been alive for three whole days. How long would that be in human terms? Three days, that's 72 hours. By human terms, this insect is already more than two hundred years old. Just what line of research are you following? An elixir of life... - That old one? - Nature's elixir. Hormones. Female hormones. What is it that gives a woman's skin that silk in texture? Why does she keep her hair when so many men lose theirs? Hormones! Female hormones! - Yes, I have heard the theory. - No longer a theory, professor, fact. See for yourself! Here. Yes, it is remarkable. I wonder... ... how it would work on a male? You can see I used a male. Sorry, old man... My due, it's an easy-laughed mistake to make. Something as small as this. This insect is male! Then, who laid these eggs here? You could've made a mistake, old chap. Anyway... What happens next? Next? - To increase the life-span of an insect, -- where does that lead? I don't know yet. I am... I'm not sure. It's just not possible, Doctor. You've claimed me heart, I have got none to supply you now. It's important to me, Byker. Very important. Well, perhaps, eh... ... there is an alternative. But, it would have to be... quietly done, you understand. Quietly done. It will be just between you and me, Byker. Can you arrange it? - I'll see what I can do. It's a couple of fellows,... ... named old Burke and Hare. They're in the Troitsa this week. I'll see what I can do. - It must be female, no more than twenty years old. Oh, I shan't forget. It's exactly how I like them. It's alright, isn't it? I mean, she has been pretty, hasn't she? Except, with a cart we went over her. Wait in there. You'll find a good brandy. What do you think he needs 'em for? - Eh? - What do you think he does with them? - I don't know. But, if I was you, I wouldn't need me meat-boys in this neighbourhood. - Alright. - You've done already? You get away. Get it away from here now. What about the others? - Others? - Yes, I shall need more. As many as you can get. Others? Might cost you a little more. You'll be paid. I think we could supply your needs. Yes, I think we can do that. We'll be in touch. And that's how it's going to be That's how it's got to be For me Watch out for these tasses. Keep your hands to yourself! The good doctor keeps an excellent cigar. They're onto a very good thing all-around, my friend. A very good thing. What do you mean? Well, he only mucks about a little bit. Doesn't he? That one tonight, for instance. Top hat's as good as new. We could sell what's left elsewhere. You said we could supply him with more. What'd you like, gentlemen? - You, for a start. - Oh. Cheeky, aren't we? - I can afford to be. - And, uhm... What would a girl have to do to get that, then? Nothing that's not in her nature. We'll have two pints of porter. For the time being. I have what you want. As long as you can pay. I've seen this girl before. She works at the tavern. - Worked. Worked at the tavern. That's the correct vernacular I take. - Very educated is Burke. Very educated. And her neck... She's been... - Dead for some little foil. That's all you need to know, Doctor. Isn't it? That's all you really need to know. I mean, if you wish to make deeper inquiries... I could cut off your... ... source of supply. Better make up your mind, Doctor. We can do bussiness elsewhere. I thought so. Done bussiness with your kind of gentlemen before. All in the cause of science. Eh, Doctor? I mean, you got to do bad to do good. Ain't you? Doctor Jekyll... It is Doctor Jekyll? Forgive me for introducing myself in this way,... ... but I'm Susan Spencer. We have the rooms above yours. - Well, I'm sorry if I've made too much noise at late, but I've been working. It will soon be finished. - You misunderstand. I haven't come to complain. I merely wish to invite you for dinner. - Dinner? - I know you've been working very hard. And I thought... - I'm sorry. It's uncommonly kind of you. But I'm very busy at this moment. Some other time, perhaps? Yes. Yes, indeed. Never mind. He might just have had another engagement. No, he said he was too busy. Too busy? Or impervious to women. There, someone's knocked something in there. - You don't think something could be wrong? That we ought to go down there and see that he that he's... Susan, isn't one rebuff enough for you? There is something wrong. I just know there is. Something terribly wrong. Howard? He might just have fallen. Or be ill, or something. Alright, mother. I'll go down and see. Will that satisfy you? Doctor Jekyll? I'm... s-sorry. Forgive me. I take it all back about Dr Jekyll being impervious to women. A- and... He is busy tonight. Very busy, I should think. I didn't meet him. He does seem to got the joke. Miss Spencer? The time... Do you have the correct time? I have been working, I've lost all account. It's soon after eleven. But surely your friend could have told you that. I'm sorry you were too busy to dine with us last night, Doctor Jekyll. I didn't realize you had a prior engagement. My brother tells me she's very attractive. He saw her? But, how did he... Your brother saw her? - Last night. Didn't she tell you? Oh, you mean my... My sister? Sister? - Yes. - Oh... I look forward to meeting her someday. What is her name? Uhm... Hyde. Her name is Hyde... Mrs Hyde. She's a widow. Excuse me. He has sister? And a widow, you said? That is interesting news. This may quite be my day. She is a damn pretty woman. - Howard! - Oh... Sorry, mother. Just the same, she is deuce attractive. Jekyll having a sister like that? Never thought he had it in him. So you see, we were both wrong. And yet both right. Mmm... What the devil do you mean? - Oh, the insect, you recall. I said it was male, you pointed out that it couldn't be. But it was male before I cheated it. You mean, you changed it's sex? - I invested it with female characteristics, yes. - Keep away from me, my boy. I'm having far too much fun that way I am. But I did succeed in extending life. Somewhere I've gone wrong. Somewhere... Perhaps from the very beginning. Playing around with things you don't fully understand. Oh, take my advice, dear chap, and give it up. Get back to your own line of research. - I can't give it up, not now. I'm so close. I must continue. I can't! There's been a message for me? None at all? No. No, sir. Secret assignation? - No, it's just... Just two fellows who said they'd meet me here. Forgive me. Of course, I know where they're staying. - Then take me to them. Huh... I don't know about that. Back in there, they're very funny customers, aren't they? They'll want to see me. Alright. They're at Mrs Murphy's. It's not far. We can walk. Looking for something, darling? - I'm not looking for you, Yvonne. I'm looking for Mrs Murphy. - Mrs Murphy ain't there. - Where is she, then? - Floating down the river, I shouldn't wonder. What's going on? - Burke and Hare! The grave-robbers! That's what! And she's been a bourgie of them. That lenient bitch. That will teach her to have body-snatchers under her roof. Here, you let go off me! Unless you mean it. Unless you've got... half-a-grand. Get off of him! Where are Burke and Hare now? Burke's up there! We give a lift-up in the world. Burke by name, and a burke by nature. Come on, Doctor. Let's get away from here. - No! Hare... If I could only see Hare... Oh, you can see him... But I doubt very much if he'll be able to see you. Not after he gets out of the lime pit. I'm sorry... It's got nothing to do with me, but I've heard you pacing there for hours. I know you haven't eaten. Please don't be offended. I'm flattered. Not offended. Would it compromise you if you took a glass of wine with me? Thank you. You must think me a strange man. No. I think you're noble. I think you're working on something good. And dedicated to it. Far too dedicated. I'm delighted to make you eat. But I wish I could make you rest. To stop driving yourself so hard. I can't. Not untill I've made a decision. Your health and my gratitude. Please. What kind of decision? - It's a question of morality. I have to weigh an evil againt non-questioned good. A life-boat with... half-a-dozen people aboard. And a big steamliner with, perhaps, five hundred. Would you sacrifice the life-boat to safe the steamliner? - It's absolutely necessary to sacrifice the life-boat? To save the liner, yes. Then you must. Any means is worth the end-result? - If the end-result is worthwhile and important enough... Then you have no alternative. - Any means? I decided I must take human life so as to eventually prolong it. And then came the next terrible decision. Who? At the end of the next long street He'll be there Around the next-up corner Waiting there Hello... Looking for something? Well, it wasn't me! I can tell you it wasn't me! - What a twat are you! Want a punch of bogus ratching-o? - Come on, Jack. Leave her! Come on! Do you want the law here? That... That filthy, dirty... Come on. She's not worth it. I should have killed her... I'd be doing everybody a favour if I killed her... Thank you, kind sir. You're a gentleman. - May I escort you? Oh... A real gentleman... I knew it. I'm really popular with real gentlemen. On the account of the fact that I speak langue French. 'Course, I come from very good stock too, you know. My father was a gentleman. But he wasn't gentleman enough to marry me mother. Oh, that's by-the-by. Point is, I can tell a real gentleman. Not by the way he looks... But, well... Real gentlemen... ... they have such... sophisticated taste in... ... certain things. A quiet one, aren't we? You've hardly said a word. Well, if you'd lost the youth of your breath, you hadn't lost the youth of your hands. Undo me. Please, dear. Oh. I hope you're not going to be too vigorous, dear. I mean, it's been a long, hard night and I don't want any... Hear this! Hear this! Hear this! Good people of Whitechapel! Hear this! A murder! Foul and horrible, grizzly murder! Took place within this precinct... Howard, please! There's some exitements in the area. - It's nothing to do with us. It does not concern us. ... murder! Hear this! Hear this! Hear this! Good people of Whitechapel! Hear this! Murder! Well, professor? Mutilations are expertly done. Most expertly done. A butcher? A slaughter-man? - Is very possibly. He certainly knew what he was doing. And mad just the same. I mean, who else but a madman would do that to a woman? Miss Spencer! Oh, please. I'd much prefer Susan. I've brought you some supper. - That's kind of you, most kind... I'll eat it later. You... mustn't stay. Mustn't... You're ill. - It's just a slight headache, it will... - But you're trembling! You have a fever! - For God's sake, leave me! Leave me now! Good evening. It's Hyde, isn't it? Mrs Hyde? Is it? - The... last time we met I didn't get an opportunity to... ... introduce myself. I am Howard, Howard Sencer. Howard Spencer... Yes. Uh, how is your brother? - Brother? - Doctor Jekyll. Oh. He... He hasn't been himself at late. Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Eh, well... I'll see you again... I hope. Howard? I hope we shall meet again. Well! I may not have much time for Dr Jekyll, but his sister is absolutely marvelous. - You've just seen her? - Yes. She's downstairs now. - I'd love to meet her. Mamma, do you suppose... - Well, you could hardly go barging in without an invitation. But, you do have that tray to collect. Doctor Jekyll? It's the same as before. A same devilish hand. But, professor... Why would any man do that? She was very young... and pretty. Ah, Byker! A word with you. I'll see you later. You seen this one? Not very nice. I'm used to it. Anything familiar about it? Familiar... Well, you've been around as many bodies as I have. How's Doctor Jekyll? Jekyll? Well, I should imagine. You hadn't been supplying him lately then? - Not lately, no. - I see. There's no point in offering him this one. What he wants has already been taken. Am I disturbing you? - No, I'm glad to see you. I wanted to see you to apologize for my behaviour last night. - You're feeling better. - Yes. Come in. Let me take that. - Oh, thank you. Sit down. What's burning? - Oh, just some old clothes. Well, not old, exactly... Stained by chemicals, you see. I'm... I'm afraid I was careless. Well, as long as you replace them. - Yes, I've already ordered some and they're sending them over. - Oh, that must be them. It was outside the door. Oh, I see. Thank you. - You've heard about the murders, of course. Two. Mamma is absolutely terrified, just completely forbidden me to... Fools! The blasted fools! How could they've made such a stupid mistake? I specifically ordered them to... It's not even your colour. - But it's not a mistake... - What? - They're for your sister. You see? Charged to Mrs Hyde. Around the next-up corner Please make him there Waiting there I'll keep searching, looking, waiting, hoping He'll be there I have to know what you're up to, professor. I merely want you to wait and to observe. Depends on how long I have to wait. At the moment, there's not much to observe. He's at home. He's awake. There's nothing ought to report. - Patience, sergeant Danvers. Patience. And moderation. I want a sober and reliable witness. Witness to what? Maybe nothing. We shall just have to wait and see. A man. They'll be looking for a man. - What was that you were saying about moderation? Don't do as I do, sergeant. Do as I say. He's got a woman in there. What? - Just now... I saw a woman get pass the window. - Where? - She's gone now, but there was a woman. Are you sure? It was a woman. I saw her shape clearly! I'm no Berryl Lothary here, but I can tell a woman when I see one. Oh, there she goes again. Ah... Oh, perhaps Jekyll has taken my advice at last. And forsaken research for a while. - Might that mean we're sitting here for nothing? With an empty brandy flask. Mrs Hyde? Someone coming out. It's a woman... And a deuced pretty one, too. Professor... There. That's where we're supposed to be looking at. With an empty brandy flask. Trouble with is you don't know when you've had enough. You did in order without that last gin. - I'm alright. - Well, you could straight your own mind. Don't you be taught into any strange men or familiar ones, either. I'm telling you, I'll be alright. Hey, just a minute! Come here! - Hey, what's it now? Over there. - Where? - Someone waiting. Oh, it's only a lady... Later, Vonne. Night. - Night. Excuse me... Do you mind if I walk a little way with you? Company? - Well, with a murderer about, I'll be glad of it. Yes. You don't think he'd do 'em in twos, do you? Who are you? Do I know you? I don't think so... No, I don't think so. Sir Danvers! Sir Danvers! There's been another murder. - Where? - Hoeur d'Elaine, sir. Ole d'Elaine! There. It explodes your theory about Dr Jekyll. Whip him up! Any comments, sir? None... that I haven't already made. It's a queer business, sergeant. Very queer. Oh, I'm sorry... Ah... Doctor Jekyll. Uhm... Good evening. And, uh... How is your delightful sister? F- fine... Excellent. I am in excellent health. Oh, it... It... No, no, you've... You misunderstand me, your sister. Howard... Won't you hear me? No! Jekyll, my dear chap... I just happen to be passing. And so I thought -- marvelous opportunity to catch up on your news. See just how much progress you've... ... you've been making. Seems rather more than I'd anticipated. Taken my advice, eh? - No... Well, I... I mean... No need to be embarassed, dear chap. Perfectly normal and natural. Been preaching it to you for years... Get a woman in your life... A good woman. And one day you'll wake up, you'll look at yourself in the mirror and you'll see a changed man. But, Robertson, I... I don't mean to be rude, but... - Understand, dear chap. Understand absolutely. The two is company, three -- positive deviation. I'll, uh... I'll leave you to it. Terrible thing, these murders. Murders? Oh, come now... I know you're a remote sort of fellow, but they've been happening all around you. - Oh, yes. The murders. I've... paid them little heed, I'm afraid. My... work, you see. The elusive elixir of life. How's it going? Well. Very well. Couldn't be better. I'm glad to hear it. Most glad. I was caught in a terrible trap. To continue my work I needed sister Hyde. Yet, all the time I became more and more aware of her growing dominance within me. A dominance I no longer had the strength to fight, contain or control. Hello, darling. Looking for something? Yes, constable? What is it? - Another murder, sir. In Legger Button yard. Sergeant Danvers... - When did this happen? - Very recent, sir. Minute, probably. Trail is quite fresh. - Yes, well, tell sergeant Danvers I'll be with him directly. - Sir. At first, there's another call I must make. Professor Robertson. But, of course, it could only be you. You have me to disadvantage, ma'm. - My brother has told me so much about you. Won't you come in? Your brother? Doctor Jekyll. I'm his sister. The deuce you are! He never mentioned that he had a sister. And such a sister. - Uh, oh... Forgive me, ma'm. It is your brother I came to see. He's not here. Thought as much. How long has he been out? All evening? Haven't seen him since I arrived. I knew it. I knew I was right. I don't understand... - Perhaps I shouldn't be saying this to you, ma'm, but, I have grave suspicions... Very grave suspicions. Suspicions? About his actions, his state of mind. Professor, I'll be honest with you. I, too, have been very anxious about him of late. But, we can't talk here. And if were to return... There must be somewhere else, somewhere quieter. More discreet. There are my rooms, of course. But, then you would be unchaperoned. That would be an adventure. To date I'd met a very shortened life. Come, professor. You did tell him? Said he'll be along directly, sir. - Not like professor Robertson... Not like him at all. Wonder what's keeping him. Your brother... Forget him. I can't. That's why I brought you here. To talk about your brother. You've heard of the... ... murders in this area? The Whitechapel murders? Well, I have been involved in them. In an official capacity. There's a terrible similarity about all the victims... About what he does to them. I told you I had grave suspicions. All that suspicion is based on observation. And my knowledge of your... ... of your brother's work. I've lived with this problem for days now. I've struggled with my conscience... After all, your brother was... is my friend, I owe him something. But I have a public responsibility, too. And I am convinced that your brother is the man who... We can talk later, professor. It's you?! That was a dream... It is nightmare! No! Robertson... It was you! You! Well, I'll be rid of you! It is I who exist, Doctor Jekyll, not you! It is I who will be rid of you! Rid of you! Rid of you! Rid of you! Howard. If you... If you knew what you... do to a man... Oh, if you could imagine what a man feels when he... But I can... ... imagine it. Howard? Oh, damn... It's Susan. Dear sister Susan... Howard? Yes, yes... Just come in... I thought I heard your voice. Oh... Er... This is... ... Mrs Hyde. We were just, eh... ... just talking. My sister Susan. I've been longing to meet you. I... know your brother quite well. So, I gather. He's very fond of you, isn't he? He said that? There are no secrets between my brother and I. None. Yes, he's very fond of you. And I am very fond of your brother. A fascinating stratum, don't you think? It'll be interesting to see who wins. Wins? - But, of course, I have the stronger personality. I always have... Ever since I... Ever since the moment I was born. My poor brother is far too weak. I don't think he's in the least weak. But, not like you Howard... Not like you, you are... But, now you must go. Both of you. Leave me! When shall I see you again? Please go. Leave me! We'll see who wins. We'll see. Knife grinding! Hit it off the grinder! Knife grinding! Hit it off the grinder! Susan... - Doctor Jekyll. Oh, but, you look so ill. You must... - Just over-worked, that's all. You saw my sister last night? Yes. I want you to promise me something. Stay away from her. - Your sister? But, I don't understand. I can't explain, just trust me. Stay away from her, she means you great harm. But, why? And how could you possibly know? - I just... feel it. That's all. Promise me you'll do as I say. If it pleases you. Thank you. - And you can do something for me in return. Anything. I have two tickets for the concert tonight. Howard doesn't care for it, and mamma is too tired... - I will be delighted to escort you. If you would come for me at eight o'clock. Well? Very pretty. But then, you always do look very pretty. - But, I want to look specially atractive tonight. You think he'll like it? - That's if he sees it. Lucky if anyone sees anything tonight. A fog's like pea soup. I got lost, twice, on my way home. Oh... That's charming. You know, it's quite charming. - Oh, Howard, do you really think so? Yes, positive. So-fit a prettiness. That's how it's not wasted. What do you mean? - Our Doctor Jekyll's a pretty unpredictable chap. It's just the likely that he'll call it of at the last minute, and... He wouldn't do that. He promised. Mamma... - No, of course, he wouldn't ill-keep his promise. Howard knows he will. Is just teasing you. You did agree eight o'clock, didn't you, dear? I think that clock's a little passed. No... Yes, just a little. Perhaps he got lost on the stairs. Oh, I've told you the fog was thick. He must be on his way by now. I'll go and meet him half-way. Bye, momma. Doctor Jekyll? Doctor Jekyll... Doctor Jekyll? Doctor Jekyll! Please... He's outside, calling a cab. Good night, Howard. There will be a different kind of victim tonight. Not a street-walker. A fresh, young virgin! It's then, the tug of war will become dead between us. I had won a battle, but only just. I knew it could only be a matter of time before sister Hyde completely took over. My only hope lay in pin-pointing the floor in my researches and that meant one more experiment, one final experiment. So desperately I turned for help to Byker. I'm very sorry. As you can... see for yourself I've got nothing that's suitable for you. I'm very sorry. I had to kill again, but I dared not evoke Hyde. I had to do it myself. Myself. Myself. - "Marie, if you find your gent charge him up a grand". "Tell him it's gone up, tell him everything's going up!" I write this testament as a scientist. And as a salutary lesson to those who would tamper with nature. Laugh if you like,... but I worked for the man once. A doctor. Special work, if... - Get to the point! The point is... We all know how "the ripper" carves them, don't we? We all know his particular little quirks... Well,... this doctor used to carve them in the same way. The self-same way. Well? Who is he, this doctor? What's his name? - His name? Oh... I'll tell you that, perhaps. After I've had another drink! Tell me, now! Right now! And now it is done. Finished. And I have destroyed myself. And those that I loved. I think that window's open. Would you close it, Susan, please. What's the number we got? - Number 30. Attention... Doctor Jekyll? Police. Open up, in the name of Law. What's... Have you seen him? - He barred me in, sergeant. Sergeant! Look! Up you go. Where's the loft? - For pitty sake, what's he done? - He's the Whitechapel murderer.
