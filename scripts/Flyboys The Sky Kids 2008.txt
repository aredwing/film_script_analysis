No idea. - What does your father? I have no father. Actually ... Somehow, I think. I've never met him. This is Jack. Who is Jack? Rick's brother. Are you new? Are you the brother of the nursery? He said you two, with a few friends, have robbed him. That is not, how I remember. You call my brother a liar? - Yes, absolutely. Listen codger.

Uncle Ed save for their own plane. Do you like airplanes? No idea. No idea? I've never flown. Do you do this often? - As often as I can. I may never my mother, they hate flying. Why is that? - I do not know. My grandfather was pilot, in the Second World War. He shot down 17 enemy planes. He is a hero. He is alive, if you want, you can meet him. Again. We are far too late for dinner. Thank you Uncle Ed. - Yes, thank you Mr. Thomas. It is all right, let's say Ed. Say no to your mother, I've flown with you. Love you kidding me? - And certainly say nothing about that spin. Or about those somersault. Or that nosedive. Shall we again tomorrow? - And the school then? We have no school tomorrow. Is that so? - Yes, teachers consultations. Really, huh? Okay, come to seven hours to the airport. - Seven o'clock in the morning? Yes, we are going to make a couple's somersault and ensure that you are at school on time. Nice to meet you Kyle. - Yes, same to you. Hey, make sure your nose clean. - We are not ready for eight hours. Did your uncle with your impact? - Of course not. This is Kyle, he's new here. We have great hunger. Stop blowing bubbles, baby. - This is already two months on date. If there is no mold on state it is still good. Katie, if you do not stop, there is no puppy. Who said anything about a puppy? - Hey, we can call him Ace? That is a stupid name. - So they called Grandpa. Okay, we are still talking about it. Like Grandpa wants, that a dog is named after him, little gay. Sorry, what? Such words we use here. What's a gay? This is not just word. See what you did? You would be an example for her to be. Can I maybe some chicken? - Of course, grab a drum stick. There is also still a pup. He does not talk more, since he has the surgery twice. That is okay, he talked not much anyway. He was always on the veranda and smoked a lot. I do not know why they bring him his meals. He almost never eat something. Grandpa. Here is your food. Are you hungry? You want some water. See you there. That he received for saving a pilot, when they were both shot. He took it from there sometimes, for them to show me. Then we began to polish them. You had me today not only must leave behind. Since that alley. When that thing with Jack. You had no way to go. I'm sorry. I thought that you have saved. And did you, or not? You came out. And if I did not road could have been? Earlier at school, I helped you. You had to help me. I'm sorry. I was scared. I'm sorry. It is all right. We have reports, or not?

Let us now but around bicycles. This is so cool. Owns one of your uncle here? No, he maintains them alone. Hey, come take a look. Can this be? - Yes, everyone here knows me, I'll do this more often. Is it difficult to fly? - No, Ed taught me how. He takes me everywhere. You want something really gaafs see? Where are we going? - Wait and see. What are you doing? That is so cool. - Great, huh. What type is it? Wait until you see the cockpit. Wait. Are you sure this is okay? - Sure. Here is none. Look. - It looks like a camper or something. Yes, come inside. Do not. Nowhere in print. - Calm down, I do nothing. Not start, okay? Want to see what gaafs? Put your hand on it. Look at the wings. What have you done? - Nothing. Hide. That is probably the owner, we gotta get outta here. - No, they will see us. Hide it. Fast. The walkietalkie. We gotta get outta here. And what if he goes off? They probably just find something. They go off It is time to go. They have weapons. What should we do? What do you think we go? - No idea. There is always something bad happens, if you spijbelt. What do you see? There are still more. Where are we? I do not know. Are we on car? - Are you crazy. Maybe now we fly back. Maybe. Wake up. Come on, wake up. What time is it? I need to find the bathroom, I needed to pee. I am hungry. Would this be something to eat? Come here. Is that what I think it is? Where's the door? No idea. Where is everybody? I do not know. We tell the pilot, fast. You should fly. - I can not fly.

Jason, how can you have countries? Kyle threw the bomb out and helped me in the cockpit. And helped me to have a mountain to fly. - Hello Jason. The plane will remain here, the owner is known. We take the two boys in custody, they did something that clearly was not. There is no evidence, that there were problems with this plane. There is no evidence of a crime. - One of ours? The police are still mistrustful ... - Those kids are super. We think that there are about four million on board was this week. Most comes from the casino. There is nothing found on board. Find out who did this. - That all may have been Angelo. Search Carmine. And call my brother. The police is outside, the plane leads to you. They want a few questions. Super, keep them busy Sal, make them a couple sandwiches, or something. Okay, I call Silvio. - Good. I want my plane back. I want to know who did this, so I 'm can be murder.
