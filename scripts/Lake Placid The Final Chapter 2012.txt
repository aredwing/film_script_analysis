(ROARS) DENNIS: This research is very important, Sheriff. TERESA: Don't worry, Dennis, we'll catch you one. There's a good feeding spot up here where the currents meet. Sounds good. Why does this always seem like a better idea on dry land? Why did the crocodile cross the road? To eat the chicken. You have a way of taking the fun out of things. You sound like my daughter. Remember, we're here to capture, not kill, not injure. As far as we know, there are only half a dozen of these crocodile creatures on all of planet Earth. There's more two-headed cats born every year. Oh, now we know that's not true. The point is, we kill one of them, even one, we're making the world a lonelier place. Are you buying this craziness? It's tree-hugging bullshit! All right, get to it. Crocodiles, normal crocodiles, they couldn't survive in these conditions. (GRUNTS) Yeah, yeah, we get it. They're a damn miracle! You know, the miracle is that we haven't napalmed this place yet. My previous job used to be on the anti-preservation side of things. Fish and Game shanghaied me into this for one reason. Yeah, to make sure you didn't go to prison for poaching. Because I know how to blow these bastards to high hell if things go all ape-shit. (CROCODILE GROWLS) Reba, I've got one. (SIGHS) (CROCODILE GROWLING) What the hell was in those? Elephant roofies. Seems like it did the trick. Jump into croc-infested waters, that's smart. Smart, no. Fun? Fuck, yeah! (SIGHS) Lieutenant. Sheriff. You got what you came for? Five-footer. Should do. Great. Then let's get the hell out of here. Spotted the footprints of something bigger down the shore. TERESA: How much bigger? RYAN: A lot. Work fast. Eat me. Let's get the hell out of here. (CROCODILE GROWLING) We gotta get the hell out of here. Oh, for fuck's sakes. (GROWLING) Damn it! Max! Open the gate. Come on, Max, open the gate! (CROCODILE GROWLING) (DEVICE BEEPING) Watch this shit. You're gonna love it! (ROARS) That one had to be 20 feet long. You told me the biggest one was six feet, maybe seven feet at the most. Listen, lady, the first time I saw that thing is when it tried to bite our asses off. It's your job to keep tabs on them! It's a big damn lake! Look, none of my people saw anything that big while building the fence. What, your boyfriend gets a pass but I don't? Max, wait by my truck. If I can stick my head into this lovely argument for a second... Let me guess, the Godzilla wannabe up there is even more miraculous and life-affirming than the rest of them, and we can't kill it either. No! But something important is happening here. Crocodile, a normal croc? No way it gets even 10 feet. He's right. I mean, the growth rate on these crocs is mathematically impossible. You want to contain this problem, Sheriff? You gotta find out the cause, mutation, environmental factor, what? Think about that before you start shooting guns. There's no need for shooting. That's what the fence is for. Keep crocs in, people out. Who has access to the lake? The four of us, a few more Army Corps people, EPA, Fish and Game. From now on, no one goes in or out without my say-so. I'm gonna call your boss, see if I can get him to take your leash off. RYAN: Hey. Hey. Look, she's not my... The Sheriff, she is nobody's girlfriend. (SCOFFS) Sounds like your problem. Can we, uh, short circuit this whole rebellious teen, authoritarian dad thing, please? I'm good. Now can I get back to work? Look at me. When this place was a glorified petting zoo, I was okay with you being here. Now, with what we just saw... You gonna tell those other guys that it's too dangerous for me to work out there, but not too dangerous for them? Okay. Finish your work and I'll see you at home. (SIGHS) (DOOR OPENS) Hi! Hi, Mom. Give it. Ah, give it back! Oh, don't tell me you're studying again. If you saw the reading list I just got from my Lit professor... The ink isn't even dry on your diploma yet. Ease off the throttle a little. What do you have against having a good time? I slept in today. No, you didn't. I heard you typing on your computer when I left this morning. (CHUCKLES) I'm a little obsessive. (LAUGHS) A little? (LAUGHS) A lot. Come with me on a walk. I want some coffee. (LAUGHS) (EXHALES) (SIGHS) (TURKEY GOBBLING) (GOBBLING CONTINUES) (GRUNTS) (CROCODILE GROWLING) TERESA: The EPA director won't even submit it to his subcommittee, which means... Cut out the boring parts. My hands are tied. MAN: Bitch! (SCOFFS) What's his problem? Why does everybody think this is our fault? We've been here six months. Black Lake was lousy with the reptiles before I ever heard of the place. Mmm. Hey! What can I get you? Hey, Barbara, the usual. Yeah, sure. Me, too. Thanks. TERESA: So, I have a really great idea. CHLOE: Yeah? Yeah. What? Why don't you read for a couple of hours, you know, then we'll rent a movie, a foreign film, so you can still feel like you're reading. (CHUCKLES) Chloe? Yeah? Yes to what you said. So what's the first book on your list? Uh, Heart of Darkness. Heart of Dark... Oh, that's an even better idea. We can rent Apocalypse Now. Mmm-hmm. BARBARA: Here you go, ladies. Thanks. He's cute. (GIGGLES) Oh, my God. Mom, we're not talking about boys. I don't want to talk about boys. I don't even have a boy to talk about. (LAUGHS) Really? Really. Whatever you say. ELAINE: Chloe! Uh, this is my cousin, Tina. Hey. Hi, Sheriff. Hey. Oh, wait a second, isn't this your senior camping trip this weekend? Yeah, we're tagging along with Dillon High because our class was so small. I thought you were going. I'm not going. I thought I was making you go. Please, make her go. Okay, I gotta go, all right? I order you to have fun whether it's with me or your friends. Yes, ma'am. Love you. TERESA: Make her have some fun. You really should come, Chloe. There's still room on the bus. Is Drew coming? (GIGGLES) (SIGHS) JIM: Let's get Dennis his croc DNA so we can make us some money. Camp all set up? Yeah. Just like you said. This way. JIM: How about the boat? DENNIS: Ready to go. (BEEPING) (MUSIC PLAYING ON EARPHONES) (CHUCKLES) (CROWD CLAMORING) Now, look! We need you all to just calm down. See, we all want the same thing. SHARKEY: No, we don't. We want those damn things dead. And you want to... To make the town safe. You swore up and down it was safe, but now we hear there's one of them 40-foot long. That, sir, was a gross exaggeration! This wouldn't have happened under Sheriff Willinger's watch. It did happen under his watch. That's why I'm here. We also have the Army Corps of Engineers here to build a fence to contain them. We're trusting the same Army Corps that built the levees in New Orleans. Listen. In the time I've been here, I've come to know a lot of you. The last thing that I would want is to put any of you in danger. The fence will hold. You have my word. I'm gonna turn this over to our Fish and Game rep, Reba. Reba, can you enlighten us as to why we have to protect these creatures who've killed dozens of people? Well, when you put it that way, I'm gonna get going. Reba, please. (SIGHS) Fine. Look, I'd rather be harpooning them myself than babysitting them, but, uh, they are the only ones of their kind. I mean, we kill one of them, even one, we're making the world a... What's the word I'm looking for? A lonelier place. If you need anything else, I'll be in my office. (CROWD ARGUING) Hey, hey! Calm down! Calm down. We have everything under control. Thank you. (SIGHS) It's a late lunch. You almost won 'em over in there. I do my best. If they only knew you were lying through your teeth. You know what, Loflin? I like you, I really do. I think you're trying to build a 10-foot levee around a 100-foot swell, but... You got a nice ass. That goes a long way in my book. Oh, don't worry, Barbie, I won't play with your Ken doll too long. I mean, you made your claim on him perfectly clear. Might as well have peed on him. TERESA: You're a class act, Reba. I know. Enjoy your drink. We plan on it. Right, Loff? Loff! Loff? Sheriff! Wait up. Loflin, (SCOFFS) I can't do this. Teresa. (SIGHS) Have dinner with me tonight. No. I have plans with Chloe. No one would think less of you. Actually, they might. Come on. The whole town already thinks we're together. The fence is almost finished. There is no conflict of interest. I'm an elected official, and as you've pointed out, you're leaving town. If you don't like me, just tell me. (SIGHS) It's not that. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Excuse me. I'm sorry, have a good night. This is the Sheriff. ELAINE: Hey! Hey. Heart of Darkness. (GIGGLES) It's a great book. I mean, so I hear. I just started it. Who reads? Elaine says you might come with us. She did? She did? If you do, I'll give you the CliffsNotes version. Come on, Chloe, it's the last trip before the snow comes. DREW: No pressure. If you want to come along, we're leaving at 7:00. (CHLOE SIGHS) Oh, my God. Please come. (CROCODILE ROARING) Sounds like showtime, boys. (JIM WHISTLING) (KISSING NOISES) Do you see anything, Dennis? Nothing yet. (KISSING NOISES) Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Come to daddy, you fucking bitch. (GROWLING) (GUNSHOTS) JIM: Get out of here! Let's go! (GROWLING) (GROANING) Hey, honey! They didn't have Apocalypse Now, but I got the Gilmore Girls. Which is really the same thing, isn't it? I take it you're going. It looks like you packed for college. Yeah, I brought a couple of books in case I get bored. (LAUGHS) And there are chaperones? And you're camping at Clear Lake, right? Mmm-hmm. And Elaine and her cousin know these friends of theirs? Yeah. They all met in juvie. (LAUGHS) You're not going. Okay, you can go. Probably the last time you'll ever sign one of these. Don't say that. (GIGGLES) Want to stay and have some food with me? No, I've got to get going. Bus leaves in like 10 minutes. So, I'll be going, I love you. I love you, I love you. See ya later. Okay. This is great! Have fun! (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) (SIGHS) (SIGHS) Oh, God. (EXHALES) Hey! Do you like, um, red wine and Kung Pao chicken? (PANTING) Hi. (LAUGHS) (ELECTRICAL BUZZING) (SCREAMING IN DISTANCE) MAN: (SCREAMING) No! (DEVICE BEEPING) Hello? Hey! Who's out there? Dennis? Reba! (MAN SCREAMING) Hey! Who's there? (CROCODILE ROARING) (SCREAMING) (GIGGLING) DREW: You guys didn't go on a class trip? We barely have a senior class. Small school. Do you have sports? We have a math team. (SCOFFS) Cool. (CHUCKLING) GUS: Phew. Ooh, baby. What's up with you? Nasty girl. (BRAKES SQUEAL) (GRUNTS) What was that? Sorry, Coach. I almost hit a deer. Keep your eyes on the road. (SIGHS) CHLOE: Are you sure we're going the right way? Lighten up, Chloe. We got everything under control up here. Look, it's not my first barbecue, okay? Just back on your seat. (SCOFFS) It's okay. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Come in. The Sheriff, in the living room, with a wine bottle. Arrest me. (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHING) (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) Polished that off, huh? (LAUGHS) Oh, my God. (SIGHS) We're professionals, Ryan. So you pointed out earlier. Well, I'm glad you changed your mind. I didn't change my mind. We're just having some food. (CHUCKLES) (EXHALES) You know what this says? It says you're gonna fall madly in love with me. (CHUCKLING) We're gonna get married, and we're gonna have 10 children. (LAUGHS) It does not say that. It does. It does. It also says, "Have some more wine. " (STUDENTS CHATTERING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (CHUCKLES) Mmm! Back that ass up. (LAUGHING) Yeah. I feel like we should be there by now. I don't know. I've never been. Us, either. Most people stay away from the lakes around here. No one cares. Quit being such a buzz-kill, Zoe. Her name's Chloe. (SCOFFS) Whatever. (STUDENTS TALKING LOUDLY) Hey, kids! We're not animals! Come on, Coach, live a little. Let's do this. Hey, Coach. Are you sure we're at the right beach? Everything's all right, Chloe. Come on, I'll be here the whole time. Try and have some fun. Okay. (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) Are you sure Max isn't waiting up for you? No. No, we stay out of each other's business. Uh, it used to be that I couldn't even go to the bathroom without him wanting to follow, but then he spent 15 years listening to his mother tell horror stories about me, so. No, we're not exactly the type that waits up for each other. And I'm guessing that you did the same thing with your kid. It goes with the territory. (BREATHES DEEPLY) No. You'll leave in a few weeks. Yeah. I will. I can't do this. Yes, you can. Oh, screw it, I'll be me tomorrow. GUS: So, they're laying there kissing and he pulls his face away from hers, (CHUCKLING) Stares deeply into her eyes. And that's when he ate her face. (LAUGHS) (STUDENTS LAUGHING) But don't worry, honey, the Skin-Eater only eats virgins. (LAUGHS) Phew. I'm good. I've got a story, a true story. GUS: Hey, Blondie, mine was real. (CHUCKLES) There was this old lady, Mrs. Bickerman. She lived on a lake not far from this one. She and her husband, they had a farm, loved animals, probably too much. So when a crocodile swam up the river from the ocean, she started feeding it. It got big, like, dinosaur big. Let me guess. He ate her. My story was much better. (LAUGHTER) Well, first it ate her husband. It was years before anybody found out, but when they did, more people started to die. Bickerman, her sister, a dozen others. Can we, uh, talk about something else? This story is totally freaking me out. Sorry. Okay, let me tell you a really nice story. Rick! Jim! (CROCODILE GROWLING) Rick! (BREATHING HEAVILY) Jake! (GRUNTS) (SCREAMING) No! Are you okay? Yeah. Why? I don't know, you just seem a little nervous. I'm sorry. It's just... Being on the lake kind of creeps me out a little. Your mom's the Sheriff, huh? Yeah. My grandpa was a homicide detective. Is that what you want to do? No way! I don't know what I want to do yet. I like books. Librarian? I was thinking journalist. I'm gonna get an MBA, start a business. I want to retire by the time I'm 35. Ambitious. I mean, I know it sounds cocky... No, no, no, ambition is good. None of the guys at my school have any drive besides get high and get laid. ELAINE: Chloe, do you want me to leave the flashlight on? I'll be right there. I better go. You got to go? Yeah. Good night, Chloe. Good night. Hey, you. Hey. For old time's sake? What about Chloe? She's asleep. What if somebody sees us? Let them watch. (GIGGLING AND SQUEALING) (GROANS) Hi, ladies. GIRL: Ew. (CHUCKLING) Hey! This is not a toilet. We're swimming here. The whole world's a toilet. The sooner you realize that, the better. Perv! (SCOFFS) GUS: Ah, honey, our first fight. Bite me! (GROWLING) (BONES CRUNCHING) (SCREAMING) (VIBRATING) (SIGHS) This is the Sheriff. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Has anybody seen Gus? You mean creepy bus driver guy? Maybe he went for a hike. DREW: Whoo! BOY: Fuck! Oh, jet skis! It's go-time, bro. Yeah. DREW: Whoo-hoo! Who wants to be my co-pilot? Not me. I have serious plans to do nothing. What about you, Chloe? I... I'll ride, bitch. I am sure you will. Skank. She does have a great ass, though. Hey, Sheriff. What do you got? Well, I made a loop last night around (STUTTERS) 7:00. The gates were closed then and Max was still working. Now when I came by at 8:00 this morning, wide open. Who was the last one to see Max last night? Well, that was Jake Forester. He's one of the local contractors. He said that when he drove out of here, he saw that Max was (STUTTERS) filling up his car. Well, he must have seen someone inside. Why else would he open the gate? Hey, I got your call. What's going on? RYAN: Max is missing and the gate's been left open all night. (BEEPING) Ryan! It's a few hours old. The trail leads this way towards the water. Let's go. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (WHOOPING) (LAUGHING) Hey! Hey! (SCREAMS) (CHUCKLES) Hey! Hey, hey, guys! (GASPING) (SCREAMS) (GROANS) Ow! What the hell? Max? Chloe. What happened to you? No time to explain. We gotta go. Chloe, look! We're inside the fence. This is the wrong lake. Yeah. We have to get out of here. Wait. I'm with a bunch of friends. (INDISTINCT TALKING) ELAINE: Oh, there they are. BRITTANY: Hey, guys. Where's Chloe? Oh, she's gone for a walk. Who cares? Ooh, what happened to Joey? He got schooled. (FISH TRILLING) Hey, throw me one of those. (GROWLING) (GROANS) (SCREAMING) (ALL SCREAMING) (GROWLING) Open the door! Run! Come on! Hurry! (BONES CRUNCHING) (SCREAMING) (GIRLS SCREAMING) (CROCODILE ROARING) (CROCODILE GROWLING) Max! (GROWLING IN DISTANCE) Hey, you're not gonna want to see this. Oh. It's not him. RYAN: Thank God. That's gonna be a lot of paperwork. You're a sick fuck, you know that, Loflin? (GRUNTING) It's not the weirdest thing I've ever seen, but it's on the list. TERESA: What is it? It's the spinal column of another croc. They really are eating each other. No, the little one crawled up the big one's ass. We knew that putting up the fence would limit their food supply, but we didn't think it would get this bad. They must have run out of deer. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Gotta find Max. (PANTING) (SCREAMS) Oh, Elaine, thank God you're okay. I can't find Tina. I don't know where she is. What the hell just happened? CHLOE: We're at the wrong lake. Understatement. Does anyone have their cell? DREW: Everything I had is back at the camp. Me, too. This is crazy! This is crazy! We have to get back to the gate. It'll be faster to go back to the camp, get the bus from there. Back to the camp they just tore apart? I got away from them once already. No! Absolutely not! ELAINE: I'm not going back there. Fine, then we follow the fence, head south. Wait, there's a fence? Can we climb it? The fence is electrified and it surrounds the entire lake. There are only, what, three gates? Two, north and south. I'll get us back to the gate. Whoa! That ain't great. (CELL PHONE RINGING) (RINGING) CHLOE: How many do you think are out here? When we started work on the fence, we'd barely see any. Maybe one every three weeks. Recently, a lot. If this is some kind of nature preserve crap, how did we end up here? The gate was left open. Our parents have got to be looking for us already. They'll find us. Before we walk another mile. What is it? Does anyone else smell that? Someone's cooking. Last night, I opened the gate because I heard someone inside the fence. Poachers maybe. Poachers have guns. A gun sounds good to me right about now. You okay? Hey, we should go. Hello? Who's there? (GROWLING) (ROARS) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMING) (YELPS) (CROCODILE GROWLING) Chloe! Chloe! (SCREAMING) (WHIMPERING) (CROCODILE GROWLING) Chloe! Chloe! Chloe! (CHLOE SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) (ROARS) (CROCODILE GROANING) (BONE CRACKS) (CROCODILE GROANS) Chloe. You okay? Yeah. I'm okay. Hang on. I'll get you out of there. We gotta cut the power on the fence. Uh, bad idea. Unless you want to use the entire population of Lake Placid as bait. She's right. Without the voltage running through the fence, it's not gonna hold up long to something that big. We cut the power. The kids can climb out. Then we can put it back on. Yeah? Well, the kids won't know the power's off. There's no way they'd climb over the fence. I'm with the Lieutenant on this one. I've seen what happens when these things go all psycho reptile. We need more eyes out here. And guns. What's the name of that bartender friend of yours? Seth. You ever go hunting with him? Yeah, sure. He even shoots decent. For a dude. Deputy Glass. GLASS: Copy, Sheriff. Get Seth and Sharkey on the horn, tell them that crocodile season has officially opened. You got it, Sheriff. I'm all over it. (SOBBING) (VOMITING) (SOBBING) (GAGGING) Drew. I need your help. Chloe needs you. Yeah. Brittany needs her head. Snap out of it, bro. I need your help. (WHIMPERING) Nermal, tie up the back of the boat. We need first aid here. I'm on it. You're gonna be okay. Thank you. I couldn't move. I just waited. Was Max with you? No. You know what? I don't understand how half the damn universe ended up inside the fence. Why don't you build a bigger sign, Loflin? Yeah, I'll get right on that. DENNIS: You weren't gonna let me back in. (GASPING) I didn't have a choice. What did you do? I had some loose ends to tie up on my project. What kind of loose ends? Just samples. By the old Bickerman cabin. What were you thinking? After what you saw yesterday. It was worth the risk. You tell yourself that the next time you try and sign your name. Yeah, and jacking off's gonna be a bitch. RYAN: Look, he's gonna bleed out. We gotta get him help. All right, let's get you to the fence. (WHIMPERING) (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) (CROCODILE GROWLING SOFTLY) (CONTINUES VIBRATING) (HISSES) (GASPS) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Sheriff Giove. CHLOE: Hi, Mom. Chloe, thank God. Where are you? I'm inside the fence. Where inside the fence? I don't know. Max said we must have come in through the north gate. Max is with you? Yeah. Mom? You gotta get us out of here. (STATIC CRACKLING) Chloe, stay by the fence. We're coming to get you. Mom? Chloe! Mom? Chloe! Mom! Chloe, I love you. We're gonna find her. Yeah. Okay. Chloe, we found a rope. Grab on and we'll pull you out. Hurry. It's getting all twitchy. (GRUNTING) I got it. (GRUNTING) (CROCODILE ROARS) (ROARS) (GROWLING) (SCREAMS) (GASPS) (SNARLING) TERESA: Reba, are you okay? Yeah, just peachy. Never better. Come on out to the lake, have a few laughs and play World War llI with some man-eating crocs. I'm having a fabulous time. (ROARS) Ain't that a shit sandwich. (CROCODILE ROARS) (SCREAMING) TERESA: Dennis, don't let go! (GUNSHOT) Let him go. No. (BONES SNAPPING) (SCREAMING) Dennis, stay with me. Let him go. No! (CRUNCHING) (GRUNTS) (SOBBING) Oh, no. This is not gonna look good on my resume. Thanks. So help is on the way? Help is here. They just have to find us. Find anything? It's a boat key. It's gotta be nearby. ELAINE: Or it's parked in his driveway. We've already wasted enough time. Let's get back to the fence. We'll be easier to find from the lake. I'm not going back on the water. I say we go for the boat. That's a bitch. Now what, genius? (JIM GRUNTING) Well there. Howdy, girls. Come get us. I lost the goddamned key. We found a key back at the camp. Can you swim back here and get it? Well, I don't think I could make it back... Back to the boat here. (GRUNTS) Tore up my leg here pretty nasty. One of us has to go. Are you kidding? According to your shirt, you're a fast swimmer. DREW: No way. We can't just leave him. Of course we can. Hey, hey. Girls, I got guns. Dennis. Is he okay? Tell you what. You come out here and I'll tell you all about it on our way out of this dump. Come on in. Water's just fine. Screw it. I got you covered. Come on now. (CROCODILE GROWLING) Look out! Look out! Ah! Come on, boy. You can do it. MAX: Thanks. Jim. Max. Listen, I'm the one that should be thanking you. You just saved all our lives. (STARTING ENGINE) This is a mistake. We should go back to the fence. Can't you get any closer? No, no, no. Not unless you want to carve a hole in the hull. Besides, I'm not too keen on being croc chow. We'll cover you. Come on. It's our only chance. Fuck this! ELAINE: Chloe? Just come on. Elaine, don't. MAX: Come on! Come on. Please. I can't go in the water. Come on! The place is crawling with crocs. Don't leave me. Chloe, come on. I'm so sorry. ELAINE: Come on, Chloe! MAX: Come on. You can do it. Quickly. Quickly. (CROCODILE GROWLING) Chloe, grab my hand, grab my hand. Help. (WHIMPERING) (ROARING) Hey! Oh! I can't get a clear shot. Hey, now. You like a little nip, huh, sweet cheeks? You sure? Hmm? Made it myself. Well, let's motor this boat out of here, huh? (CROCODILE GROWLS) All right, you got your search areas. Spread out and give them hell. Go find your kids. We'll take care of these crocs. Got one. Starboard side. At least somebody's having fun. You did what you could. Didn't even want to go on this stupid trip. Now they're never gonna let me check books out of the library again. I left the library books back in the bus. (CHUCKLES) I think they'll understand. (SIGHS) The librarian is such a bitch. What were you reading? Heart of Darkness. Lame. You didn't like it? Nothing happens in it. It's too bad you lost it. You could've read it to the crocs. Bored them to death. (CHUCKLES) Hey, Jim, where are you taking us? (CHUCKLES) Heading for the gate. What do you mean? No, you're not. I haven't got what I come for yet. Need a little more line here, Max. Wouldn't it be faster to tie up at the dock? Trust me. You don't want to go near that dock. You said you were gonna get us out of here. And I will. But you're not the only one I made a promise to today. Dennis? No shit, Sherlock. (GUN COCKING) Oh... (SCOFFS) Either you drive us to the gate, or I will. Drew, put the gun down. Shut up, Chloe. Son, as if you got the stones to pull that trigger, boy. There's a cabin up the road. The Bickerman place? My rendezvous with your buddy Dennis. No way you're a scientist. Only other reason for you to be here is as a poacher. Oh. And Dennis wouldn't allow that. Well, sometimes money's a lot more powerful than integrity, honey. You paid him to let you in? Ah. Bingo. You're a smuggler. Crocodiles are rare. The only ones of their kind. Rare means expensive. JIM: All right, you got me. (CHUCKLES) I'm a greedy old fart. But right now, I'm just trying to save Dennis' sorry, tree-hugging ass. It'd be a hell of a lot easier if I had a little help, kids. So what do I need to do, huh? Pay you? Because I'm about to become a rich boy. Yes, siree, I'm gonna hit the jackpot. You with me? Giddy-up. Come on. Yo, Dennis! It's me, Jimmy. Dennis. Don't make me regret paying you in advance. Mrs. Bickerman wasn't a very good housekeeper. Hey. That's no way to talk about the dead, son. Whatever. You hear me, boy? Huh? Huh? Get inside. All of you. Everybody inside. Not so fast. Listen, if I... If I hit the jackpot, maybe I'll come back for you. How's that sound? Adis. I thought you needed our help. No, not with this part, son. Sorry. You, too. Come on. DREW: Guy's a whack-job. You think now's the time to curl up around the fire? That man just pulled a gun on me. In fairness, you pulled a gun on him first. CHLOE: Our parents are out there. They just don't know where to look. Chloe, you're a genius. GLASS: Sheriff Giove, over. A trucker just picked up the missing kids. Repeat, the missing teens are outside the fence. You've got them? Yes, ma'am. The teens are at the south gate. On my way there now. Get a room. (GRUNTING SOFTLY) Where are you, sweetie-pie? Come on. Where's my big-ass bitch? Damn foot. (SIGHS) There's my babies. Yeah. My little golden eggs. Now I just need me one of those brats to get me out of this shithole. TERESA: Chloe? RYAN: Max? Has anybody seen Chloe? Tina. Tina, where's Chloe? I don't know where Elaine is, or Chloe. Sheriff, you've got to find them. Yeah. We're doing the best we can, okay? (SIGHS) I'm sorry, Sheriff. Call came in there was only survivors. We've been up and down the perimeter twice. If Chloe's still inside, she's not by the fence. Come on. Let's go. Hey, don't lose it. I'm not fucking losing it! Uh, it looks like you're losing it. I don't know what the hell to do. I take it that's an unusual feeling for you. You know what I think? I think you gotta quit your navel gazing and your soulful eye-banging with G.I. Joe over there and do your damn job. You are the most by-the-book, stick-in-the-mud bitch I know. The kind who wouldn't let emotions get in the way of what she had to do. That is who is gonna find Chloe. So be her again. Let's go check Bickerman's cabin. Bickerman... I hate that rat box. (CHUCKLING) MAX: I hope they see the smoke. DREW: We should go. If he's telling the truth, if Dennis is meeting him here, we can't leave him. DREW: Listen, Max, sometimes we can leave people behind. If it means saving our own asses. Not everybody has abandonment issues. Do you think this place has a bathroom? It smells like it does. (FLIES BUZZING) Hey, guys? (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) DREW: Come on! (WHIMPERING) (GASPING) Elaine. Come on. I need you. I need you. Chloe! Chloe! Mom? Mom! Chloe! (ROARING) Chloe! (GUNSHOT) We're gonna find another way out of here. Elaine, we're gonna get you some help, honey. You had me worried there, kid. MAX: Hey. You find Dennis? Dennis is dead, kid. Who's this? He's a poacher. Jim Bickerman. I saw the picture of you with your mother, "Delores and Jimmy, 1960." Oh, you're the nut-bag cousin. With all due respect, Miss Fish and Game, I'm the son of a bitch that saved these brats. Nut-bag! Is that what they're calling me back in town now? No. That's what I'm calling you. Ah. Nathan Bickerman owned this cabin, and before he skipped town, he told me that his cousin was suing him for it. You're not honestly pissed because you didn't inherit this shit house. Jimmy. Can I call you Jimmy? Yes. Jimmy, the way I see it, not leaving you this place is about the nicest thing anybody could ever do for your crazy ass. (CROCODILE GROWLS SOFTLY) You tied that thing up? Uh, Dennis did. I just sort of helped. Yeah? What'd you do that for? Whatever. Let's just get out of here. You don't want a full confession? Maybe you have changed. (CROCODILE ROARING) Well, well, well. Now, that was some kind of fun, huh, folks? Listen, I'd love to just hang out here and chat with you all, but, Max... You're coming with me. You let him... Oh! Excuse me, Daddy. I'm not gonna get very far with just one wheel here. I need this tough guy to help me along the way. Uh-uh-uh. Wouldn't do that. He'll be dead before you pull that trigger. Max... I'll be okay, Dad. You're a dead man. (ROARING) (CROCODILE SNARLS) This would be a good time to run. Go! Go! Move! Hey, hey, hey. Slow down, there, sport. I only got one gear left here. (DISTANT GROWLING) (ROARS) Drew! Drew, no! Get out of the water! Drew, get out! Drew! Drew, get out! Drew! Drew! Stupid asshole, get back! Let him go, Max. He's dead anyway. Drew! Max, come on. Get out of the water, Drew! Get out! Max! Drew, get out! Max! Get out of the water! (GROWLING) (GRUNTS) (CROCODILE GROANS) Max! Get out of the water now! Come on! (GIRLS WHIMPERING) Whatever you do, don't look up. (CROCODILE GROWLING) Mom! Mom! (ELECTRICITY ZAPPING) (GROANS) (WHIMPERING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Mom. (SOBBING) Mom. Well, damn it. I always miss it when they kill the big ones. (GRUNTS) (LAUGHING) (GROWLING) Too late, big daddy. Your babies are omelets now. What's the matter? Hungry? Eat shit. (ROARS) (SCREAMING) (INDISTINCT TALKING) TERESA: I'm going to follow you to the hospital, honey. RYAN: Is she okay? Yeah, I'm gonna get her checked out. Mom, I'm fine. God, I just need a month-long nap. Chloe, I really love you. I'm never, ever taking your advice again. (LAUGHS) That's probably a good idea. We've spent most of our life apart... I don't need this feelings speech. Okay. No feelings. I'm just glad you're not dead. Okay, I'm gonna be right back, okay? Thinking the fence thing was a bad idea. I can definitely confirm that it was hard to escape from. Hey. Hey. Don't let that librarian give you a hard time. I won't. I'm going there tomorrow to beg forgiveness. Speaking of... People don't change, Ryan. And I don't really think that they need to change, I don't want you... I don't want you to stay here because of me. If you are happy building levees and fences, then you should go do that, and... Um... Just come back here once in a while. I was thinking of getting a library card. Maybe I'll see you there. Yeah. I'd like that. Welcome home, you handsome prick. MALE RADIO ANNOUNCER: Rise and shine, Lake Placid. Hey, how you doing, and good morning. It's 86 degrees on the water with blue skies for as far as the eye can see. And guess what? The Army Corps of Engineers has assured us that we are now croc free on Clear Lake. How about that? 100% croc free. So put on your bikinis, slather on that sunscreen, pack a cooler and come on out for a dip. We'll see you in the water.
