Now it's the limit of endurance. Let's bring this reckless act to an end. Smoking at public places is prohibited. Violation will lead to penalty. Don't smoke. Or let others smoke. You will have to pay a heavy price for smoking. Who doesn't want to be happy? But at what price? You will have to pay a heavy price for smoking. Smoking is iniurious for you. And for your dear ones. You will have to pay a heavy price for smoking. Kiran... You wait here. l'll be right back. - Oh, Mr. Dubey! Good morning! - Good morning! - Have a seat! No matter what day of the week it is... ...you always show up here to put pressure on me. Well, all l need from you is my pension. After that... ln any case, l don't enjoy unnecessarily doing the rounds here. No, no...do the rounds! It's good exercise! Listen... - No, you listen! Look at this pile of files. And here's your file. When it reaches the top, you'll get your money. My files hasn't moved up for two years now. Oh, Mr. Shinde! Ty and bring Mr. Dubey's file up. l'm ready to do it, Mr. Sharma, but to reach the top, it needs a little monetay push... And Mr. Dubey isn't ready to give it the right push... what can l do? You people should be ashamed of yourselves. l'm old enough to be your father! Then think of us as your sons and give us the money. But remember one thing, Mr. Dubey... - Today you're our father's age... - ...but if you wait too long... - ...you'll be our grandfather's age by the time your file comes up! The things you say, Gupta! Give me my money. He's lost it! Throw him out! - You can't do this to me. Get him out of here! This is my life's savings! - Out! l'm not begging! Don't show your face here again! - Give me my money. Come on, come on. Please! Let him go! They're treating me like a beggar. Look where your file is going now... right to the bottom! - How dare he manhandle me? Get him out of here! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! ls my father okay? Yes...lt was a minor stroke. This isn't the age for him to be getting into fights. But, Doctor that's his hard earne'd money. And at this age, he can only support himself with his pension. - But another incident like this, could prove fatal. - You have to keep that in mind. - It's a good thing you brought him here quickly... Nepali and his two thugs. Looks like Samad Khan's work. Wow. You news guys know evemhing before we do. What can l say, Inspector. Nowadays, we journalists have to do your work, too... Oh, really? Sir, l've told you in the beginning... lt takes Rs. 11,OOO to fix this computer. Now how can l give you a discount of Rs. 2,OOO? Stop whining for Rs. 2,OOO! You're the one whining, sir. l sell hardware, not underwear. Okay, take Rs. 9,500. Final. Not a rupee more. Rs. 11,OOO or else... ...l'll show your wife all those porn films from your hard disc. Evemhing's been saved on this CD. Forget underwear... ...your hardware will turn into software. Relax, l'm giving you Rs. 11,OOO! Can't we ioke around a bit? - Kalim! - Your phone! Here! 11,OOO in full! Hi, Maya. - We need to meet... l think we've got our first case. - Who switched on these lights?! Quiet. Listen carefully. These time bombs will now be activated. As long as you keep running around this stadium...they won't go off. But if any one of you stops running...BOOM! Why are you doing this to us?! Because you three enjoy making helpless folk... ...do the rounds of your office for years. This time however to save your own live's... ...you'll be doing the rounds. Listen, please... We're ready to pay you anything. We'll give you money! Lots of money! That's the difference between us and you. We don't take bribes. Please... Don't do this, sir... Hello? - On your marks! ls this the Aai Tak News Room? - Get set! l have some a vey interesting stoy for you. Go! Hello, Police? Come on, Maya, let's get out of here. Keep running! Don't stop! Keep running! Keep running! Don't stop! Come on, keep running! Don't stop, don't stop! - Get back! Keep running! Bomb squad! Hury up! Sir, it's iust a firecracker! - In Breaking News - - Three government officials were kidnapped by a masked gang... - ...who then made a tape of them which they sent to all news channels. Let' see what they had to say. We've been talking about fighting corruption for 65 years... ...but nothing's really happened. We've only worn out our shoes with candle marches... ...landed up in hospitals when we went on hunger strikes. Peaceful processions only got us beaten up by the police... Nothing ever changes. But now, things will change. By punishing corrupt people like Sharma, Gupta and Shinde. From this moment, decent citizens like Makrand Dubey... ...will not be victims of corruption anymore. When, both, the right and wrong way fail... ...you have to take the middle road. - Sharma, Gupta and Shinde have been charged with bribey... Manav, l want to follow this gang's stoy. Alright. Do it. - As for the masked gang... ...citizens have praised them and also accepted them with open arms. - Let's hear what they have to say. They made those corrupt officers dizzy by making them do rounds! lt used to feel like being retired is a crime in this county. By getting Mr. Dubey what is rightfully his... ...they've stood up for evey senior citizen. This gang that gave the finger to corruption... ...has a new name from the citizens... - The 'Ungli' (finger) gang. You were right, guys! We have a name to sign autographs with! The 'Ungli' Gang. - Shhh... How cool is that! Don't talk about autographs in a public place.. ..if you don't want a warrant with your name on it. - Relax a little. - This is iust the beginning. We still have so many things to do. Guys, l was thinking... What's happened has happened. We've been lucky to not get caught. Let's not push it. What do you mean? Are you quitting? l'm iust scared, guys. How can you even think of stopping? - Shhh! - Especially now! Maya, this isn't a candle march. l run my house on my salay alone. What'll happen to my family if l go to jail? Besides, who are we? Ajournalist, an intern, a mechanic and a computer engineer? Beyond a point, we can't change squat! Goti... have you forgotten Ricky? - Let it be, man... We've chosen our path. Let Goti choose his. Goti. There's no pressure. Take your time. Kalim, what happened of our headquarter? l've found a perFect place. How much for this place? 25,OOO rupees a month. 25,OOO? For this hole?! At this rate, this is the best you can find in Mumbai! lt's completely central. There's a McDonald's nearby. There's also a an Udipi restaurant and a pizzajoint! With free home delivey. Wow! You should said that first! Guys! l think this place is good for the office. What do you think? And between the three of us, the rent won't seem so high. Actually... lt'll be even less if it's between the four of us. Sory. l chickened out a little. lt's not important that you chickened out... ...as long as you manned up on time! Mr. Dubey, can you recognize those people? Even if l could, l wouldn't tell you a thing about them. How many of them were there? 3...no, 4! Sir, one of them was a girl. What car is this? - It's a Tata Ventura. This video was recorded a few minutes after the kidnapping. - Note down the car number. - Sir, no garage has any information. - l think the number plate was fake. Sir, according to this lab report... ...the security guards were injected with a sedative called Midazolam. lt's impossible to get this sedative without a Doctor's prescription. We couldn't find anything from chemists of hospitals, either. Sir... Before the Ungli gang gets out of control... ...we have to get Inspector Kale on their case. Sivaraman, have you lost your mind? Trust me, sir. This way you can handle the Thane district political parties... ...and the public and media will be assured... ...that we're tying to catch the Ungli gang. Sivaraman, l... - Sir, l give you my word... ...that Kale will not cause any problems. He respects me vey much. l can handle him. l've called him today, sir. He's waiting to meet you. Okay. How's Thane district? The officer before you used to complain about the mosquitoes. Sir, l have no complaints... ...the complaints will come from the mosquitoes. Unlike the previous officer, l don't eat sugar... ...my blood is infused with salt. Kale. On my recommendation, the commissioner... ...wants to assign you to a vey important case. Which case, sir? They call themselves the Ungli gang. They give the finger to the system and law and order. l want them found and stopped. Okay, sir. You can't go in! Move! Hey! What's going on here?! Where's Ansari? Tell me! What's going on here?! What's up, Ansari? You're going to file a case, are you?! This is your final warning. lf you don't take back your lawsuit against Gaikwad... You're done for. Understand? Yes, Ali! When did this happen? Excuse me. Are you okay? Yes. My bones and spirit are intact. l'm not going to hide like a coward. l'm will file an FIR against Gaikwad today itself. Look what he's done to my computers. You'll be able to recover my data, right? l'll ty my best, Ali. Thanks, Gautam. He's been going to the Municipal Corporation for 2 years now... ...to get Gaikwad's hoardings removed. Gaikwad's men threatened him a few times. But he didn't give up. He's possibly thinking of filing a lawsuit. - The FIR isn't going to do squat. The FIR is worth less than the paper it's written on. He can't touch Gaikwad. Yeah, you're right. The police have explained this to Ansari already. Filing a case will cause even more trouble. Next week is Gaikwad's birthday. Just see how his sycophants will fill... ...evey street corner with 'Happy Birthday' posters. Next week is Gaikwad's birthday? Yeah. Why? Who's there?! Security! Who entered my house! Security! Security! Are you all dead?! Not a single wall was spared! Who entered this house? Who did this?! l just asked you that, why are you asking me! Who entered this house? Tell me! Where else are these put up?! Behind you?! There's nothing! Your... - Behind me? lt's behind me? - A message to all our politicians... This city is not your personal property. lt is the home of us citizens. And if anyone messes up our home... ...then we won't hesitate to mess up theirs. - Forget his posters in the city... Today onwards, Gaikwad won't even pose for his family pictures. To hell with theoy, we love the Ungli Gang! - These politicians have ruined the city with their damn posters! - This gang has taught them a good lesson! This gang is really giving the finger to corruption, huh? Not iust the finger... ...they're completely exposing the system. lt's been two days since the Ungli gang struck! Are you chasing them or faffing?! Sir, we are tying our best to catch them. Well, stop tying and catch them! - Next time, it won't be but a higher power who calls. Hang up! - Why are these amateurs proving so hard to catch? What do you need to catch the Ungli gang? Sir, the Ungli gang thinks differently. Their method is different. Their purpose is different. To catch them, we have to think like them. We'll have to do something different. Then do something new! Yes, Mishra, tell me! - Kale, my blood pressure is off the charts right now. Did Nikhil do something? - What do you think? Okay, l'm on my way. - Oh, Kale! Come, come... What a fortunate man you are. J As far as l remember Kale didn't even go to get his son's report card... ...but here he is for your report card! What has he done, Mishra? Listen to this stoy, carefully... ...because l've never told a stoy like this in all my 47 years in this job. - Last night, around 12. 30 am... - ...we got a call from the Marine Line's girls' hostel. - Someone called the matron and warned her... - ...there was a bomb in the hostel. Take your team and check the first floor. Move fast! - You take your team and check the second floor! - Check evey room! What are you doing here?! l was missing you. Couldn't wait until morning. Did you do all this?! Sometimes you have to use a fake bomb to get to the real bomb... Are you tying to kiss me? lt's what l'm known for! And now for the plot twist, Kale! - We traced the number that called the matron... Guess where the call came from? From my landline! A call from the Mumbai Police Bomb Squad Chief! Now give me one reason to not suspend this man right now! - One reason! Sir, l'll give you three reasons to suspend me. One, l'm no good for this iob. Two, my antics threaten to tarnish my father's respect in the force. And three, l don't think l'm going to change. - Look, Kale! Look how disrespectful he is! Get out! Thank you, sir. Thank you?! - You're laughing?! How was that funny? l'm sory, Mishra. But even you have to admit; it's an ingenious method to meet a girl. These methods will seem ingenious if they're used to catch felons! Not to be a delinquent, yourself. His mind is no less than any delinquent. And l don't want him in my squad! lf you want to groom a criminal... take him! Ashok! You? Here? Come, come in. lt's been so long. Sit. Have some tea? No. Where's Nikhil? He's not home. He came and left. Why? What's he done now? lf you hear the saga, you'll start a war. l'm sory, Ashok. You've done a lot for us after Nikhil's father passed away. Arvind wasn't only my partner. He was my friend. Whatever l've done has been for that friendship. l've tried to make Nikhil understand... ...but he's so stubborn. He's so like his father in so many ways. Truly. But l haven't given up hope on him. Besides stubbornness, he has so many qualities of his father. No problem. l'll find him. ''Oh, girl your moves Look so kinky to me'' ''Oh girl, your dangling earrings Look so funky to me'' ''Oh that killer look you give... Like the sharp edge of a knife'' ''Oh girl, your tantrums... Feel so hanky panky to me...'' ''Shake those hips to the beats of a song'' ''And make this pauper heart feel like a prince'' ''Put those high heels on And, dance Basanti'' ''Dance Basanti'' ''Dance Basanti'' ''Forget all the limits and just Dance Basanti'' ''Dance Basanti'' ''Dance Basanti'' ''O when you see me you go wild'' ''You want my love you want it now'' ''You see me dancing up a star'' ''You know, you know that l'm the bomb'' ''Oh when l pump it up on the floor-ohh'' ''l know the boys be going uffo-oh'' ''And l'll be shakin' it up, takin' it up, makin' it go, breakin' it up'' ''l'm gonna be funking it up'' ''Hey Basanti, where do you live?'' ''Hey Basanti, open up the gates of your heart'' ''Oh, Basanti your smile's like an ex! plosive'' ''From head to toe, you're a missile'' ''Shake those hips to the beats of a song'' ''And l'll take whatever satisfaction l get'' ''Handle your row of admirers and just dance, Basanti'' ''Dance Basanti'' ''Dance Basanti'' ''Forget all the limits and just dance Basanti'' ''Dance Basanti'' ''Dance Basanti'' ''O when you see me you go wild'' ''You want my love you want it now'' ''You see me dancing up a star'' ''You know, you know that l'm the bomb'' ''And l'll be shakin' it up, takin' it up, makin' it go, breakin' it up'' ''l'm gonna be funking it up'' Yes, Kale sir. - Nikhil, meet me at Lalit bar tomorrow at 7 pm. Why? Can't you lecture me on the phone? - l'll be waiting there for you, Nikhil. - Be there. - All l want is news about the Ungli Gang. - What is this bullshit, ya? - Not a single concrete report on the Ungli Gang. What the hell do you guys come to do here?! Can you please disperse and get me something concrete? Go! Bad meeting? Don't ask. Manav bit my head off. Ouch... So not a good idea to suggest coffee? Correct. What's Manav's problem? This Ungli gang! Can't find a lead! And l'm getting cursed because l'm handling the case. Can't understand why they're getting so much importance. Seems like a bunch of spoilt, rich kids who want a bit of fame. Oh, right, l nearly forgot! You're the famous crime reporter, Mr. Abhay Kashyap. Why would these ordinay cases interest you? You handle serious cases like murders, gang wars and extortions. Thanks...You think l'm famous... You wish. And these spoilt, rich kids you're talking about are a lot more than that. They're heroes in the eyes of the public. And trust me, Abhay. This is just the beginning with them. Seems like you're really close to this Ungli gang... Bye, Abhay. Well done, Abhay. You should write a book on how to win girls over. What's the update on your love stoy with Teesta? Nothing, man. Listen to me. Let her go. lf you don't mind, can l get her before letting her go? lf you're going to let her go, then what's the point of getting her? Correct? Listen, listen. Abhay... listen. Teesta wants something only you can give her. That only you have. mye. Now you're being vulgar, Goti. No, man, l'm talking about information on the Ungli gang! Shit! You're right! Why didn't l think of that?! Goti! You'll get the first invite for my wedding with Teesta. Thank you. You're driving drunk?! Show me your license? - Thank God it's only a dent and they didn't kill someone! How do these underage kids get licenses? The credit for that goes to driving schools... ...and corrupt Transport officers. - Getting a license is as easy as going grocey shopping. These corrupt officers would give a license... ...to even a blind man for a few bucks. Wow, Kalim. What an idea! You move! Smile! Sir. Sir, the photo's okay, right? As long as the notes are okay, don't wory about the photo. You'll get the license in four days. Go. - Okay, sir. - What's the update on the Orion group? We have a few sources who are ready to share information... ...on Agarwal's deals and broker's information. The stoy'll be up in a few hours. Good. And what about the Ungli gang? Uhh... Please tell me you have something. No, Manav. We don't currently have anything. Ya, Abhay? This iust came in the post. lt's from the Ungli gang! What's in this? Actually, it's fan mail... What? Read it and see. Hi, Abhay. Your crime reports are quite interesting. Next time we give someone the finger, you'll be the first to know. - Cheers. The Ungli Gang. Not bad, Abhay. Thanks, Manav. Abhay! Abhay! How could you?! l had no idea you were so unethical. Besides, this was my stoy! You could have at least come to me before going to Manav! We could have shown it to Manav together! l've never been a fan of sharing. Don't be so iealous, Teesta. Relax, Abhay. l'm not jealous. You know what. l could introduce you to the Ungli Gang. Maybe... for my sake... they'll drop a stoy or two your way? l don't need your introductions or help. ls that clear? Okay. Fine! lf you change your mind, don't hesitate to ask... Goti, bro... Mission successful. Hi! Yes, Gadkari! He's blind. But you don't wory. He has a license. From you! He is capable of driving on the streets, according to your Transport officers. But! You left out the most important part before giving him the license. What? Test drive! But we can fix that. Yadav is going to take you on a test drive. Yes, sir! Here are the car keys! One minute, sir. Let me keep my cane away. Relax. Higher! To the left! A little lower! Flash some light! Light?! ldiot! You can't see! He can't see?! Sory. Drive, drive! Sory, sir! Sory, sir! lt's my first time! Should l switch on the AC? Stop! Enough! Switch it off! What 'ahh'?! Stop it! Save me, God... Save me!!! Look in front! l gave you the license? Stop the car! Stop the car! NO!!! Stop the car! Reverse. What do l do with these contact lenses? You can keep it. l've been struggling in the film industy for so long. No one's ever given me a role. Tomorrow onwards, you'll be flooded with offers. Evey news channel will have your face on it. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Shhh! l have a gift for you from Abhay! l'm going to take my hand off your mouth. Don't scream. Okay? Enioy the CD! And don't forget to thank Abhay. ln today's breaking news... ...the Ungli gang's latest stunt has shaken up the county... ...by exposing the partnership between... ...Transport officials and driving school in License corruption. By using a blind man, they've opened our eyes. The illegal license issued, endangers the lives of citizens. The legal driving age is 1$, to avoid that danger. Nice! Thank you! Wow... You're rocking! The biggest breaking news is that Manav is happy with me. Someone asked me to thank you for the CD. Thank you, Abhay. It was vey sweet of you. What can l say... It's nice to see a beautiful face on the morning news. Well... if you're not satisfied with just looking at the face on TV... ...then maybe you can look at it in a coffee shop after work? Really? Really. - You're not as bad as l thought. l can be veyiudgmental sometimes. Did your Ungli gang member ask you to apologize, too? Shut up! How did you know l would come? l've known you since you were a kid. You always liked free things... ...whether that's a lollipop... or whiskey. l've also known you since childhood. This free whiskey could really cost me. What happened of your college hostel girlfriend? We broke up six months ago. Then that night? l'd gone to give her something l'd forgotten to give. What? Goodbye kiss. This badboy image of yours can fool others... but not me. There's still some good in you. Wow! l knew there were X rays for your body... ...but you can X ray even my character! Vey good. What do you think of this Ungli gang? Let's see. l'm iealous of them. We've been called to sing at the party, but can't sing. We're the police and we get no credit for doing ourjob. No one can do ouriob besides us. Lazy and ineffective people have no right to anything. The laziest person in the world is imparting wisdom to me. Sitting in a bar, drinking free whiskey is of no use. lf you want work, l'll give you work. And that is to catch the Ungli gang. You've been kicked off the bomb squad. Join me and you'll report only to me, Nikhil. Why are you doing me this courtesy? You don't look it but you're just like them. l was right. About what? This whiskey really did cost me. - Have you thought of a plan? - The plan is exactly like theirs. We have to find something that's bothering the public. Like these sidewalks... and their potholes. The Municipal Corporation has dug up wherever and whatever they wanted to. Except for the sidewalk... ...in front of the Municipal Commissioner Pradhan's house. Which, incidentally, he fixed up Iast week... with the public's money. And all for his son's wedding in 3 days. What exactly do you want to do? Just... want to greet the wedding guests... ...with something other than refreshments. Just give me 3 months, an allowance... ...admission in University and the freedom to myjob, my way. This information should only stay between us. What information, sir? - Good Morning and welcome! - The Ungli Gang presents an explosive wedding video just for you. This video has music, playing and wedding guests. We played the music. Mr. Pradhan, our Municipal Commissioner, is the one who got played. And you all are the wedding guests. But don't wory about giving the bride and groom a gift. You've seen the gift... ...the potholes in front of Mr. Pradhan's house... ...which the Municipal Corporation had fixed with your hard earned money. Perhaps Mr. Pradhan will now realize... ...he who dig holes for others, often falls into it himself. The Municipal Corporation fill their pockets than the potholes. lt's his son's wedding and we're paying to fix his sidewalk?! Ungli Gang, we love you!!! Hello? How'd you like the explosion? You're creating explosions there, and we're feeling the tremors here. Are you crazy? lt's not like you've hired me to sing prayers, sir. l've been getting the hiccups all day... Somewhere in this city, the Ungli gang is thinking about me. - Dear Ungli Gang, here is an explosive wedding video just for you. - This video has music, playing and wedding guests. - l played the music... This scoundrel is using our name and taking the credit! lt's not cool! Whoever he is, he's vey intelligent. Question is, why is he doing this?! To be famous, why else?! No! This isn't going to benefit him at all! He's using the Ungli Gang's name! We're the ones getting the credit! - ...those who dig holes for others, often fall into it himself. He's even been smart about his imitation! Hey, guys... come check this out. Come, come... Watch carefully. The graffiti on the wall is exactly like ours. But if you zoom in... there's something written there. 11... Do Tanki, C.S. T. 11 pm, Wednesday. This is an address... near C. S.T Station. Yeah, Goti. - He's been waiting for two hours... he still isn't tired. He has to tire eventually and come down. Okay, he's coming down. l knew you'll would come to meet me. Who are you? l'm a fan of yours. What you'll are doing is correct. l want to ioin your gang. You think this a club that we can give you membership to? Come on, guys! You'll saw how l taught BK Pradhan a lesson, right?!! l gave such an audition for your gang... ...that the audience would immediately know it's you! Yes... ...but we don't need a new partner. Look, l know it's not easy to just trust me. My name is Nikhil Abhyankar. l'm a law student at the Mumbai University. And l want to join your fight against corruption. Finally there's someone who's fighting the system! And is winning! Nice speech. But the answer is still no. Then why did you come here? To give you a warning. Go study law quietly. Don't ty to take the Iaw in your hands like us. Andheri? Where do you need to go? - Andheri, west? lt's too nearby. Long fares only. Andheri, sir? Andheri? Where in Andheri? - Andheri, west. Too close by, madam. Please, sir. Look at how much stuff l have to cary. Please? lt'll cost you double the fare. Why double fare? That's how much it costs... If you want to go, let me know. Or find someone else. Okay, come. Mom, what are you doing? Get down. - There you are. Good. You do this. My feet are paining. What happened? l'm getting old! Not to mention, l was looking for a rickshaw all evening. l had to wait for an hour! You should have called me! l would have picked you up on the bike! No, no. Why should l disturb you at work? Nikhil... something needs to be done about these bully rickshaw drivers. They're only interested in long fares. Don't care about senior citizens. But, Nikhil, today l have noted down the number of this rickshaw. Where did you take this rickshaw from? Where do you want to go? Andheri. Not Andheri, sir. Only long fares. What the hell are you doing?! Will you go to Delhi? - What? - Drive quietly. - Or else you'll reach heaven before Delhi. Start. lt was a mistake, sir... Forgive me! Keep going. Yes... Please forgive me. Look ahead! - Forgive me, sir. - It was a mistake, sir. Forgive me! - Turn and stop here. - Stop here. - Open that door. - Open it! - Take this rickshaw inside. Sir, please... - Sit. Let me go, sir... Sir, please, sir... Sir, let me go... Only long fares, right?! Here's a long fare. Go to Delhi! - Ghanshyam Tiwari. That rickshaw driver... ...who was sent by the Ungli gang to Delhi for a 'long fare'. He was found with his autorickshaw on a Delhi-Mumbai goods' train. This driver only went as far as Delhi. lf the autorickshaw drivers don't stop harassing the common man... ...and don't stop being greedy for long fares... - ...next time we'll send them a lot further than Delhi! The Ungli gang has done the Traffic Police's job. Hope these rickshaw guys learn their lesson. They act like doing their job is a favour to the citizens. lt's a good lesson for rickshaw drivers. They have no manners. The Ungli Gang has given them such a long fare... ...that the next time they ask for one... they'll rethink it 10 times. We autorickshaw drivers will not be secure... ...until the culprits are caught! This guy wants to meet us again. Monday. Same time, same place. Doesn't seem like he's going to stop. Have to admit... he has a really wicked mind. Truly. Sending the rickshaw driver with his rickshaw to Delhi... What a badass thing to do. Until yesterday, he was our fan... ...now it seems like you'll are his fans. Next you'll say he should be a part of our group. What's your problem, Abhay? Why are you so scared? Do you think someone new will endanger your importance in the team? This is your insecurity! l'm not talking about my insecurity. l'm talking about the security of us all. What Nikhil said that night is true. This isn't our fight alone. So, what do you want? - Whatever. - What do you mean whatever? We should give him a chance. Fine. But let's find out if Mumbai University student Nikhil Abhyankar is... ...a soldier or a problem. - Seems that whatever Mr. Nikhil Abhyankar said is true. So. Do you want to meet him? - Despite our warnings, you didn't change... People who ty to change me, usually end up changing themselves. This isn't a game. lf you get caught, you'll go to iail. Gandhi didn't wait to claim salt. Only difference is... he used peace. We use force. l've never met anyone as crazy or stubborn as you. Just think that l'm a shadow of you'll. Remember one thing. lf you betray us... ...l'll kill you. l won't give you the opportunity. l like living. Welcome to the gang. The official Ungli gang. Kalim, Goti, Maya... Abhay. There's another... ...who isn't with us today. Nikhil... ...meet Ricky. Ricky is Maya's older brother. We first met him at his gym. - He used to make us do these strange, scay exercises. Crossfit. - He's a wonderFul guy... ...but super strict when it came to exercise. - He wouldn't let us go until someone vomited. - As we built our bodies... we formed a friendship. lf l tried to bunk... ...he would come home and drag me out of bed to go workout. He, himself used to sleep like th! e dead. Even on Brother's Day. - Wake up! - How much can you sleep? Come on, l want my gift. Letting you celebrate Brother's Day is my gift to you. Give me my gift. Give it or else l'll take it from your wallet! Then the incident happened... ...which caused Ricky to fall into a slumber so deep... ...that he still hasn't woken up. - Can't you understand? - Can't you see? Didn't you see the car? l've been honking for such a long time, you couldn't see the car? Look... Listen, old man! l will turn you into a piece of garbage like your car. What?! You overtake from the wrong side and then make noise?! Won't take me too long to mess you up, do you understand?! Stop, stop, stop... Aren't you ashamed to be harassing an old man?! What, man? Is he your father or something?! Leave it now, come on! Get out of here, or l'll smash your face. Aye, boss! He'll kill you! You want to create trouble? You've come to get a beating?! Come on, come on, come on! Let's go! What are you iust standing there for?! - Help him! - No, sir! This is a police case! - Help me! - l'll take him to the hospital! Doctor! How's Ricky?! l'm sory. He has massive head injuries and internal hemorrhaging. He's in a coma. - It's difficult to predict anything in coma patients. - He could wake up tomorrow... or take years. But evemhing happened before my eyes. Sir, they hit him with a cricket bat. He's suffered life a life threatening attack. How can you not file an FIR?! We have the car number. l told you already! l don't want to file your FIR. Don't irritate me unnecessarily. Get out! When they found out l was ajournalist, they agreed. Evey citizen has the right to file a complain. l'll put you all on the front page if you don't! Then we found out, Anshuman Dayal, who hit Ricky... ...his father, BR Dayal, was well known in the police department. He was a bookie for the whole police force. Hello? Mr. Joshi, why are you tying to be a hero at this age? Enioy the few years you have left... Take the case back. - Who is this? l'm going to report you to the police. Mr. Joshi... you don't understand. This is the police. lf you value your wellbeing then take this case- Who was that, Grandpa? No one, dear. You go to college. Bye, Grandpa! Let's meet his grand daughter... lt was iuice this time. Next time, it'll be acid. Tell your grandfather! Understood?! Let's go. Mr. Joshi, is my client... ...Mr. Anshuman Dayal, the one who hit Ricky? No. - l don't remember. - It was dark... l couldn't see him properly. Your Honour, Mr. Joshi has given a statement to the police. l think someone is threatening him. No. l really don't remember. l made a mistake. Without him, we can't do anything! How could he do this to us? - Until yesterday, he was with us. Why did you lie? l can sacrifice my life for the truth... ...but not that of my grand daughter and family. A common man cannot fight the corrupt system here. And if they do... ...they cannot win. l would have smashed that Anshuman's face if you hadn't stopped me. And then jail for the next five years?! So what?! Should we sit here with our hands folded?! We should stop Ricky's life support system. You want us to kill Ricky? What will keeping him alive like this achieve? Dayal won. He lost to the corrupt system. Okay. Come on. Abhay... - Let's go kill Ricky. Come on! Let's go! Do it. - Abhay! Do it! You heard Joshi. A common man cannot fight the corrupt system here. He was right. Because the common man has to follow rules. He has to stay within the law. Those laws and rules that criminals break whenever they want. We'll do the same thing. We'll break the law. So that these people Iearn to respect the law. What are you saying? You want to us to become criminals and delinquents? No. l want us to be gang... ...of ordinay people who fight forjustice in an extraordinay way. Because when the right and wrong way don't work... ...you have to take the middle road. - It's time we show the system the middle finger. That night, the Ungli gang was formed. And thanks to Maya, you are now one of us. Maya? Yeah... she was vey impressed by you. ''Oh, my sweet affliction...'' ''My heart melts when l see your eyes.'' ''Oh, my sweet affliction...'' ''You've taken over my heart.'' ''When you speak.'' ''lt's like a prayer to me.'' ''This love, yours and mine Is beyond divinity.'' ''This love, yours and mine Is a sweet affliction.'' ''This love, yours and mine Is beyond divinity.'' l can't figure it out. What? How is Rapunzel still single? l guess l still haven't met my vine-climbing hero. Will this Hero Honda riding hero do? ''Sweet affliction...'' ''Sweet affliction...'' ''Sweet affliction...'' ''Your smile showers light on the world.'' ''And you teach my soul to be happy.'' ''You are my new beginning.'' ''And life is nothing without you.'' Look at what we got. Traffic cops accepting bribes on Kennedy bridge. They must make at least Rs. 3,OOO a day. PerFect. Nikhil. You'll be with us on this iob. Yes, of course. Hello? - Have you got anything on the gang, Nikhil? No. - l don't think you're up to doing this job. - Come to my office tomorrow morning. - The Commissioner has called a meeting. - Nikhil? Dinner is ready. Shall l serve? Not now, mom. What's wrong? You look upset. Mom, if one of dad's friends broke the law... Would he have turned him in? He would first ty to explain. And if he still didn't agree? Then he would do his duty. He would honour the oath he took when he joined the police force... ...more than the friendship. Come on! Come on, come on, get up, get up... Are you okay? Shit! Carefully... lt looks like a muscle pull. Nothing much. You'll be fine. You can't come with us today. No, l'm coming. This is my first job with the gang... l don't want to miss it. lf you come on you first job in this state and get caught... ...it'll be your last one. No. No, l'm coming. Relax, man. lt's not like this is our last iob. There's going to be traffic. We should go or we'll be late. Let's go. Take care. You'll be okay, man. Come on, Maya. Yes, Nikhil. Sir, in half an hour you'll find the Ungli Gang... ...carying out their latest Iark in the Mukesh Mills' basement. How do you know? l'll tell you later, sir. You only have half an hour. Stop on the side. Stop on the side. He's driving with a broken number plate. Come here, son. Come. - What happened, sir? What do you mean what happened? Think you can drive with a broken number plate? Show me your license. l made a mistake, sir. Let me go. Okay, you made a mistake. Now show me your papers. Quickly. Let's compromise, sir... 50 bucks? Do l look like a beggar? You won't get squat for 50 bucks. Rs. 200. Come on. 200?! 200 is a lot, sir. lt's a lot, huh? Jeetu! Write him a ticket. A car that size and 200 is a lot for you? Think l'm a fool? Okay, fine. My friends are in the car. l'll ty and get it from them. Okay, come on! Okay, you'll come. You, come! We have to go there. Hey, what are you doing?! You'll won't be spared! Shut up. You cops love the taste of money, right? Here. Fill your stomach with this. How can we eat these notes? Why? lsn't this part of your diet? Eat. Eat. Eat! Surround the place. Cover the entrance and exit. The rest of you, come with me. Look... please... we can't digest these notes. Ty it with pickle. Nice and tangy! l can't believe you brought pickle with you! - Dude l've even got ketchup in the van. Someone's coming. The window! Look upstairs! Look! There he is! Catch them. Catch them, catch them! Behind you! Goti, run! Nikhil! Come on... Come on! He's not even answering his phone! You think he's been caught by the police? Don't say that... Goti. - Shit, he's bleeding! Oh, shit man! Should we take him to a hospital? The bullet's iust grazed his arm. He's lucky. You were with him... How come your foot is fine? ACP Kale called him by name. How does he know your name? Nikhil? l lied to you'll. l'm not a law student. l'm a police officer. Kale assigned me to the Ungli gang case. This dirtbag has been fooling us this whole time. We trusted you. We thought you were our friend. This is your idea of friendship?! Abhay! Abhay! What do we do with him now? We can't let him go. He'll report evemhing to the police. We have only one option. We have to finish him. Are you insane? You want to be a murderer? - Maya's right, Goti. We're not killers. Do you guys understand that his freedom means jail for us all?! l'm not going to go to jail for this scumbag betrayer! Kalim! l'm going to kill him, l'm going to finish him! Kalim! Get out of my way, l'm going to kill him! Move out my way, Abhay! Control yourself! Stop it! Stop it! - Goti's been shot! Stop! l can't go to iail for him! Stop! l can't go to iail for him, man! l can't go to iail for him... Get out, Nikhil. - Go man. Before one of us actually kills you. - l can't go to iail for him... l'm sory. ''Hollow eyes.'' ''Traces of a lost dream.'' ''Like a broken star'' ''The flame of hope, flickers and fades...'' ''How, then, do we light the way?'' ''Oh, Lord... show me the way.'' ''Oh, Lord... show me the way.'' ''Pick up this broken man'' - What happened, Nikhil? ''Oh, Lord... show me the way.'' ''Oh, Lord... show me the way.'' ''Oh, Lord... show me the way.'' ''Oh, Lord... show me the way.'' Abhay? What's wrong? Teesta... l have to tell you something. Something l should have told you earlier... What? ''Two paths lie before me...'' ''Which one must l take?'' - What's going on with Kale? Why hasn't he caught the Ungli gang yet? My phone is ringing off the hook. l'll speak to him, sir. Hury up. ln any case, it's time for his transfer. You know how things get during this time. ''Oh, Lord... show me the way.'' - It's my own fault for thinking you're like your father. But the truth is... ...that you're not worthy of being his son nor of wearing this uniform. What uniform are you talking about?! The one they wear to accept bribes at evey traffic signal? The one they wear to ask for money to... ...ignore cases or extort money from citizens by threatening... ...them with false cases? Half the police officers are bursting out of their shirts... ...because they're stuffed with money. Children's dirty nappies are changed immediately. But the system has been dirty since 1947... ...and the police's job of changing it is being done by the Ungli gang! What nonsense are you talking, Nikhil? The ones you're praising are criminals. And the ones you want to arrest are now my friends, sir. l realized that if they get caught... ...it's not them but a hope that will be locked up. A hope that evey citizen of this county has. That there's finally someone who's ready to fight the system. Without any agenda. l want all their names. Immediately! Sory, sir. l can't tell you their names. Come to the police station. l'll make you talk. Come on! Yes, sir! - Kale, leave evemhing and come meet me. But, sir... - Right now, Kale. - Will you have a drink, Kale? No, sir. l'm driving. lt's bad news... l didn't understand. That's why l've called you. - To explain. - Kale, the order for your transfer has come. Don't look at me like that. - They were going to transfer you to Zone 11. You would rot and die there. l staked my reputation on you... ...so the commissioner agreed to put you somewhere good. Sir, if you transfer me, what will happen to the Ungli gang? Don't wory about them. Wory about yourself. You know you can't get a good post without bribey these days. lsn't that right? There's a lot of competition for the dockyard area. Lots of officers want it. l'm giving you that. Just make sure you give Rs. 5 lakhs to B. R. Dayal. l'll handle the rest. B. R. Dayal? That fixer?! He manages all the illegal money of the police force. ln the next few years, you'll have to pay about 40-50 lakhs more... But don't wory. You'll be earning so much, this will seem like nothing. Sir, l'm not interested in that... ...only in law enforcement. l know, Kale. But if you don't accept, that's the end of your career. Go home. And think peacefully about it. You have three days. And then, even l can't help you. - Think about it. You were right, Nikhil. The men in uniform are the worst criminals. l have no right to arrest you. lt's all dirty... from head to toe. Come on. Start the bike. - l don't get it, man. - We were going to stay away from this place. Something's wrong. Why did Abhay call us here? Abhay! You- lf l wanted to arrest you'll... ...we would be talking in the police station. Where Kale would beat a confession out of you'll. You must be wondering why that hasn't happened yet. Consider it a kindness from me. l haven't told Kale your names. Why? l thought your goal was to have us caught. lt was. lt was. But then l got to know all of you. l began to understand the objective of the Ungli Gang. Began to understand how the injustice dealt to Ricky led... ...you'll to seek iustice. Really... - l started believing in my new friends. lf you believed in us so much... ...why did you inform Kale about us? My father was a sincere police officer. He gave his life for his duty. l put myself in his shoes... And as noble as your intentions were... He wouldn't have let you take the law in your own hands. l realized that l am not my father. And he may not have been right. Why have you come here today? l need you'll. Because somebody needs you'll. They don't need law, government or the police... ...only the Ungli gang. This is bullshit. He's tying to trick us again. - Wait a minute. Say we agree to help you. What will we get in return? That which made you'll form the Ungli gang. Justice for Ricky. Anshuman Dayal and his father BR Dayal. Why have you come here? To take you away from here. Don't make me hit you. l want to explain something to you. Nothing gets solved from sitting and drinking at a bar. lf you want to do something about it, l can show you how. Remember when l was the one giving you orders? What can l say? l can't see a lion cower like this. Nikhil, there are less than 300 lions in India. lf another one dies... it makes no difference. What do you need? Just because you're not giving Dayal Rs. 5 lakhs... ...doesn't mean you spend it all on whiskey. Sitting here and cying will achieve nothing. Tears only dilute the whiskey. lt's not that easy. You were right, Nikhil. Evey police officer's uniform is tainted with corruption. Even DCP Sivaraman, whom l respected. lt's won't iust wash off. Who wants to wash it off? l want to strip them naked... Forget washing. And who's going to strip them naked? You, me and some of my friends. Why would the Ungli gang work with me? Because like yours... ...this is where their heart lies. ACP Kale... ...meet the Ungli Gang. Guys, ACP Kale. l don't shake hands with criminals. We aren't criminals. And from what Nikhil says... ...you need us and we need you. That's why we're here. What's the plan? - Sir, Kale sir is here. Bring him in. Come, Kale, come. - Sit. l iust suffered a loss of Rs. 10. l bet that you wouldn't come. This is Rs. 3 lakh. Count it. Don't embarrass me. The world knows there is no cop as honest as Kale. Even when you're being underhanded, you'll be honest. Anay, what about the rest of the money? Today's the last date. Tomorrow seems auspicious to put the money away. lt's not easy for me to put together this much money so quickly. l'll send it tonight with my men. Then tomorrow morning your post at the dockyard will be confirmed. Earn lots of money. Throw a net to catch some cash. l know you're new to this. But don't wory. lt's only tough to start with. Slowly, you'll get used to it. Just think of it like this... You're not buying a house; you're buying a career. My son, Anshuman. Do namaste to Kale sir. Namaste. Come, sit. No, Dad. l gotta go. l'll see you later. Okay. Drive carefully. - Yes... Namaste. Take care of this. This is between you and the police force. Who am l to come between such a beautiful relationship? Pande! Yes, sir. Take Kale sir and have him keep the money inside. Go, Kale. Come, sir. - Thank God he's gone... Boys. What do you want? Kale sir has sent us. Let the car in! Yes, sir? Kale sir's money. One minute. Hello? - Sir, Kale sir's men are here. Should l throw a welcome party?! Take them to the room and have the money kept. Yes, sir. Come. Hello, sir. Who's come? Kale's men, sir. l've seen you before. Have you ever come here before? No. First time. Okay. Teesta Sen? ACP Kale. Of course, l know you. But you're here...? Are you ready for the biggest stoy of your life? Welcome, eveyone. ln today's breaking news, a stoy... ...that will blow the doors wide open on corruption in this county. The criminal is neither a minister nor a politician... The criminals are the same ones who are meant to stop crime. Our Police. And the one making this sensational... ...and shocking accusation is ACP Ashok Kale. Sir, can you tell our viewers what happened that night? For the first time in my career, l was told... ...that if l paid, l would be transferred to a good place. Otherwise, l would be transferred to place... ...which could be career-ending. How much money were you asked to pay? Rs. 5 lakh, upfront. Above that, 40-50 lakhs to be paid off in the coming years. Who made this offer? - My superior officer. - DCP Sivaraman. - Who collects this money for the police? - BR Dayal who is the fixer for the police force. Bloody swine. - This money is distributed through the police force. How high does this go? To the Commissioner of police. You're making some serious allegations. - Do you have any proof? - l do have proof. And that evidence... ...will bring the police force crashing down like a house of cards. The police force's money is kept under high security in Dayal's house. This money is counted by eveyone who gets it. This money has been sprayed with a sulfur solution... When this solution comes in contact with saliva... lt leaves a black mark on the tongue of the person counting. How long does this mark remain? Four days. lt's next to impossible to get rid of it. lt can only be removed with acid. And l'm sure... ...my capable fellow officers won't wash their tongues with acid. So all we have to do is ask our top police officers... ''Sir, would you mind showing us your tongue?'' Sir, can you show us your tongue? Can we see your tongue? How much money did you take to blacken your tongue? Open the door, Sivaraman! - Sir, we won't leave! - Open the door! Down with the Commissioner! The Chief Minister should resign. lf the owner is dishonest, then why won't the dog steal the bone? Down with corruption! Down with the Mumbai Police! The public is furious, Chief Minister. This agitation will increase more. We need to solve this. Ma'am... - Could l get an autograph? - Settle down... Settle down... To erase the corruption that's destroying our society... ... l have decided to take some severe steps. So that the people meant to protect the people aren't... ...the ones taking advantage of them. Today onwards, ACP Kale will be relieved from his position. From today, he is no longer ACP... But Mumbai's new Commissioner of Police. Kale, you rock! - So that, we can fight corruption from the top. - l would now like Commissioner Kale to discuss his plans for the city. All l want to say is... No one is bigger than the law. Even if he is the protecter of the law. Commissioner Kale, how did you cary out the sting operation on your own? The planning and all? l wasn't alone. My friends helped me. - Commissioner Kale... Not bad! But, why have you called us here? To give you all some good news. Dayal and his son have been given a tough and lengthy prison term. Justice for Ricky... l would like to meet him some time... And pay my respects to the man that the Ungli gang was formed for. Of course, sir. He would love to meet the man who helped his friends. You don't shake hands with criminals, so... No, l don't. Sir.. Sory. So should l confirm this alliance? The uniform looks good on you... would you like to wear it again? l'll think about it. Think. l'll be waiting for you at the club tomorrow. Let's have a drink. You're planning to trap me again? Maybe... l hope that this city will no longer need the Ungli gang... That depends on you, sir. lf you do your work... we won't be needed. That's the thing about this generation. Give them an inch, and they want a mile.
