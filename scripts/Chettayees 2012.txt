From all these drunkards sitting here save me and my honor. Amen! - Don't play. - lt must be Kichu. Will he ever ring the bell, pray and enter? lt can't be him. Half an hour back he had called from Kayamkulam. lt is some other guy. How come association secretary is here? l was just passing by. - Have you passed any petition against me?

To the celebration fund account the members of each flat has given Rs1000. ls it? - l came to get that. lf you wish you can give. We have no such wish. You city cultured people celebrate as you wish.

She is Goddess. My wife is Goddess. lsn't that what he said? What is wrong in that? Till the last minute she tried to unite you and Gracy. Not only that. When you were admitted in hospital after cutting your veins... l have told you many times not to talk about cutting the vein. Then haven't you cut your veins? That was because none of you came here for one week. You were all very busy. Yes, we were busy. lt is nothing new. l got drunk. The loneliness got on to me. Then unknowingly l did that. After that l promised that l'll never do like this again. lt was when we promised that you said it. - What? We promised that minimum one of us will daily come here and meet you. You leave that. When you were in hospital who brought food for you daily? Who? lt was Merlin. You must be grateful to her. l got her married to Kichu. lt was the gratitude of that which she showed. That's correct. - You were not the only one who took trouble to get them married. We were also there. - Then you also go and cut your veins. She'll come with diet food for you also. - She'll come. Even if my Magistrate wife doesn't come, she'll come. Even if it is a bit exaggeration, Merlin is an Goddess. What do you say? - Yes, correct. Listen, you are right. - There is no doubt that she is an Goddess. Okay? Enough. Sir! Kichu, sir! Sir! Wife. Where? - ln phone. You drive the car. Don't scare me. Damn it! What a chest pain is it? Sir, we'll go to some hospital. From afternoon you are saying this chest pain. l'm telling you no need. ln these days even youngsters get heart attack. By taking an ECG, we can become peaceful. ECG. When was this ECG found? Just by taking ECG we can't get peace. lf it is going to end, let it end. Sir! See there. What is it? - Hospital. Shall l take you there? Yes. Not the first board. To the second board. Andappa! - Yes. - Your coming here might have got caught in that camera. lf that President sees that, you'll lose your job. By seeing me in camera he can't do anything to me. See this tool box. l have come here to do repair. Here is your money. - Okay. - Keep this also. - Thank you! Andappa! Tomorrow evening bring 3 beer bottles also. Okay. - For whose sake you are getting this beer? lt is not for drinking. Night at 12 o'clock we'll say happv new year shake the bottle and splash it all over. No need for that. No need for that. - Why? That is foreigner's style. When it gets 12 o'clock we'll howl together. That is the true Malayalee style. Like this. Kooo!!!!!!!!!! No, l won't howl like this. l'm not a true Malayalee. My mother was best Anglo lndian. Then tender true Malayalee. We need beer. We need beer. Kichu sir is not to be seen. - As he said why is he so late? You call him. Pick up the phone, dog. Sir, it is me the driver. Sir is in the bar. There is a problem, sir. Hit that idiot. After all this while is he still keeping quiet? How long is it since he went inside the bar? One hour? You go and see. Don't cut off the phone. You give the phone to him soon. From afternoon he is having chest pain. The pain was in the left side. He is still having pain. He didn't pick up the phone when Merlin called him. When asked about going to hospital he said if it is ending, let it end. Sorry! - Walk carefully, buddy. Some of them come after getting fully drunk. Sir! Phone. You! Did you say anything? - No. Like that. Will you stop us from saying anything? There is no compulsion. You try to say. l'll listen. Then you listen. - Leave it. Come with me. They won't allow me to go. - Sir! - You say then only l'll go. Get lost. - Leave me. - Leave it. - Stop. Stop it. The line got cut. ln the bar something has happened to him. This is the commotion of taking him to hospital. Move. Move away. - Mother! Oh Gosh! - Give way. He didn't say anything for which he needs to be beaten. Didn't he say? On seeing him you feel like hitting him. His Kurta, bracelet and a face like a peeled off orange. Listen. - Why should we bother? Are you fine, sir? John sir had called you. That line got cut. - l'll call back. With this chest pain what was the need for you to have.. ..hit him on his nose and made so much problem? After losing honor what is the need to live? That too when you are not sure whether you'll live. John! lt is something serious. There is some serious problem. When he told you the matter you should have asked him the area where he was. When he said chest pain how could l ask in the middle the area and constituency. What to do now? According to the time if we see he should have reached Alapuzha. Then we'll change dress. We'll take a car and go there. Correct. - l can't drive a car. My hands and legs are shivering. That is no problem. You come. One of us will drive. Bava! Don't we need to inform, Merlin? - That... Let us see what is the matter and then we'll inform. Hey! Park on that side. What pain is this? Sir! Do you want me to help you? - To pass urine? Oh! No. - Do you also want to pass urine? - No. Then you sit in car. Close the door and raise the glass. Do you have any money? - On the way we'll withdraw from ATM. There is only driver and fellow people there. They must have taken him to some local hospital. We can't take that risk. We'll arrange for an ambulance and get him here. ln a hospital of there a known cardiologist of mine is working. Best. - Then you phone him and inform. ldiot! Pick up the phone. - lt is Kichu's call. - Give me, give me. lt must be the driver calling. You switch on the speaker. We must be ready for any kind of news. Hello! - John, it is me Kichu. Hello! Can you hear me? - lt is Kichu. - Where are you now? l'm crossing Alapuzha and coming. - lt is over 11 o'clock. l'm leaving. Why the hell did you scare us all saying chest pain and all that? lt is nothing. You go and sit inside the room. l need to talk something personal to you. Don't make me tensed. Tell me what the matter is. l can say it only to you. You stand some where alone. You talk from here. - Why are you quiet? l'm going to the room. l'm inside the room. Now you say. l need to write a will. - What? - Dying statement. l can't delay it any more. l want to do it now itself. What is this.... Without making me mad you tell what the matter is. You come here. We'll go to a hospital. You can write your will tomorrow. This death statement should be written when we feel like dying. You do one thing. First you switch on that voice recorder in your phone. Then you record what ever l say. You have told me before that it is enough to make a will and it is legally valid. You come here soon. - You switch on that voice recorder. Did you switch it on? Did you do it? - You tell. Due to any reason if l die here take what l say now as my death statement. Till now what ever l have earned and what ever l.. .. inherited in all that my wife Merlin doesn't have the right of even one rupee of that. Now you switch off the recorder. How is your pain now? - l feel much better now. l feel a lot and lot better now. John! l'm coming to your flat. What ever l told you now is not because you are my friend. lt is because you are a known lawyer of mine. Except you if some one comes to know about it... What has happened to you? You only said all along that she is Goddess. Yes, Goddess. My wife is a Goddess. Goddess of devil. There are 8 missed calls. - Who is it? Merlin. - lt must be Merlin. - Why should we be tensed? We'll ask her what the problem is. She is not unknown to us. - No need. lf you talk to her, he'll come to know that we all know everything. l'll talk to her. - That is correct. We know nothing. For that what do we know? Merlin! - Johnetta! This is Merlin. l have been trying you for so long. lt has been coming as engaged. - l was talking. ls Kichuettan there? - No. He told me that the recording will be over at 4 o'clock. lt is now 12 o'clock. He is not picking up the phone. He must be kicked. - Keep quiet. Merlin, there is nothing to worry. He had called me. When the recording was over it got delayed. He is on the way. May be he has slept in car. That is why he may not have picked up the phone. See how difficult he is acting. l'm so tensed here. lf it is getting delayed, can't he call and inform me? lf he comes to the flat late, don't allow him to go. Let him sleep there. He must be tired. Once he reaches you just inform me. Okay, l'll do that. - l'll sleep only after you call me. Okay, l'll call. - Bye, Johnetta. Jesus! Look after him. Actually the fault is with whom? ls it him or her? - You call astrologer Ramakrishnan. We'll ask him to predict. His ego is stopping him from even telling us. Then for what reason are we sitting awake? You go home. - You go home. - You need not stare at me. He told you even this much because you are an advocate & not because you are his friend. Tomorrow itself you register and give him his will. Then you take fees also from him. You don't get emotional. - l'll get emotional. No director is allowing me to get emotional in cinema. Now won't you also allow me? - You be emotional. Let it come out. Let it out. - Don't make fun of me. John, he doesn't require a cardiologist. He needs a psychiatrist. What you said is a serious matter to think about. Psychiatrist. l'm saying this seriously. You think about all the things that happened in this last one year. One analysis. l'll start from the starting. lf anything is left, you make me remember. ln AR Rehman's American concert he was called to play. Then after everything was fine just 2 days before leaving he lost his passport. With that the area of Rehman was over. We know what the problem is. He is hesitant to leave Merlin and go. Then in Tamil one music director called him. Some Shankerji. - lt is not Shankerji. Shanker Raja. lt is Youvan Shanker Raja. Let it be anyone. lt was the recording of his Hindi movie in Mumbai. The flight was at morning 5 o'clock. When he got up it was 10 o'clock. Even if a mosquito bites he gets up. He says he could not hear the alarm sound. Why to tell all that? Last Madras case. Morning when he went to airport he realized that some one cancelled his ticket one day before itself. lt is a lie. He is not ready to stay away from Merlin. That is why he did all this stupidity and lost his profession. Now suddenly she has become Goddess of devil. There is problem with her too. She loved married him against her family's wish. After that what kind of love is this? Due to her over possessive love she destroyed Kichu. Let him first come. First his chest pain. Then we can talk about the rest. lt is my wife. You pick up the phone. - What should l tell her? Tell her that l'm in studio and doing dubbing. - His matter. Hello! Roopesh sir is in dubbing theatre. When he comes out l'll tell him to call you. - Best party. Don't you need to call at home and tell? lf l call her now, l'll have to hear her abuse now itself. l'll hear it fresh tomorrow morning. - That is what is good. One car is coming. lt must be him. Hey! You must all know only about chest pain. Don't spoil everything. We are all tight. Act drunk. l don't know how to act so l'll have a peg. - l also don't now how to act. Then you pour a peg for everyone. - Pour it. Here is my glass. Saji! - Yes. This is for you. Keep it. No need. - The key. - Give it. You remain cool. ldiots. What are you doing this? Keep quiet. - Don't say anything. Serious. Serious. All of you are here. - Yes, do you want us all to leave? They are all waiting for you to arrive. How is your chest pain? - lt is better. - Hasn't it gone? Then it is gone. Make a peg for me. lf he gets pain again, we shouldn't wait for his permission. We'll take him directly to the hospital. - That's all. That's all. Before he leaves you call Merlin and inform that he has arrived. You watch. Merlin! lt is John. He has arrived. He is in bathroom. Should l ask him to call you back? No need. You don't have to tell him and make him call. lf Kichuettan wants, he can call by himself. John! He is coming. - Okay. Fine. Okay. Who is it in phone at mid night? - lt is Gracy. lt is her marriage. She invited me to come. - very good. We were invited yesterday. Didn't she invite you? She invited Merlin. What about tomorrow's programme? First today's programme must be over for tomorrow's to start. Why are you sweating? - lt is very hot. We all are not feeling any heat. - Then you try to find the reason. Where are you all going? - To hospital. Who is in hospital? - Your father. What? - Lift him. - Leave me.- Bring him. - Leave. - Bring him forcibly. Drag him. Kitchu, what is the matter? - What is it? - Nothing. - Don't run. Catch him. Don't come near me. - Hold him. - Let us take him like this. Leave me. Put me down. - Lift him. - Bring him like that. - Put me down. Allow me to say. No need. Bring him like that. - Come on. Bring him. Put me down. - No need. We'll carry you. - This is a serious matter. - You listen to me. Bring him. Bring him. - Don't kick me. - Bring him. - Bring him. - Move away. Move away. No need. Bring him. - What is the matter? - Carry on. Carry on. - What is the matter? He has a slight chest pain. We are taking him to the hospital. This is not chest pain. See how violent he is acting. They are taking him as he has gone mad. This violence is the last stage of alcoholism. - You are correct. You sit tight. Don't move too much. There is nothing wrong with me. Leave me. You keep quiet. - Don't act violent. - Keep quiet. lf it had been heart attack, l would be dead by now. This is gas problem. You keep quiet.- Put some thing in his mouth and make him shut up. You stop the car. - Shut up. - Leave my hands. - Kitchu! Keep quiet. There is police. - lf they make us blow, we are caught. John, tell them that he had to be taken to hospital. That is why you drove car. - You ldiot! You keep your hand on chest and act as if you are in pain. - l don't wish to do anything like that. lf they catch, we all will get into problem. Not all of us will get caught. lt was you who drove the car. Bastard! Stop the car. Move on that side. Are you drunk? Get down. No, sir. He is having chest pain. So we are taking him to hospital. Start the car. - What is it? - All are drunk, sir. They are saying that due to chest pain they are taking him to hospital. On seeing it looks fishy. Sir, l'm an advocate. - l'm Advocate John Pallan. - So what? - Nothing. Sir, we are taking him to hospital. Allow us to go, sir. lt is paining. - Bear it. Bear it. Joseph! - Sir! - You go with them to the hospital. lf this chest pain is an act, you phone me. l'll send the jeep. Are you happy now? - Satisfied. Mobile phone, watch and phone. Nothing is allowed. Go. - Move away. Hold this. You all wait there. Take this too. - On reaching here is he having pain? For ECG it is only Rs250. - Not that, sir. First both had pain. Then suddenly one guy became okay in car. Sir, it is a fraud case. You send the jeep. May be actually he didn't have any attack. You be patient. There must be some problem with him. God won't betray us like that. Hey! See there. Do you know any one? The one whom l know are not co operating. Then how'll stranger's co operate? Get lost. Gosh! Not that. See that doctors board. lf you know anyone in that you call, Ask them if they can do any adjustment in ECG. l know that doctor Santhosh. - ls he your friend? No. Once in bar l have hit that beggar. There is nothing wrong. He is totally normal. - Thanks a lot. The jeep has come. We'll go to the general hospital. Don't we need to test the blood? - Okay. Sir, cash... - No, no. That won't work here. Once before when l came here... - lt won't work out. Tomorrow come to the station and take your license. Stop it there. Hey! Your house has come. Get down. Get down. l'll come to the flat. You need not come to the flat. Get down. - No... Get down. Get down. Get down. Start the car. - Hey! Father! Father! What is that sound? The dawn has broken out. You sleep, dear. He won't get up on time. Do you want me to pour water on you? Then you'll come to your sense. Today let me see how you go out of the house. Don't make people say that Magistrate was beaten by her husband. When will l reach court? Damn it. Sir! Sir! Tea. l didn't ask you for tea. You go. Tonight whole l'll have to keep awake. Let me sleep. Are you coming from flower show? l went to the temple. - What is so special? lsn't today December 31st? - Yes. l went to do a puja in your name. Don't you have dubbing today? - Which movies? Why do you need a name? For your drinking act the new name is dubbing. What is it? - l'm not able to get John in phone. What was it yesterday? - What? - His death statement. Will. Madness. What else? When he got drunk. He said all that. Okay, bye! Who the hell is that? You! On what courage did you come here? They are watching in camera. No camera can catch me. l went to 13th floor and came down. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Did you get yourself tested? l got the result. - Then? lt is negative. - Promise? - Yes, promise. You are giving out foul smell. Have bath and come. You come and bath me. l'll bath you but not now. ln the evening. - Evening? - Yes. l'll stay here today. Let us celebrate the happiness of the result. No, no. Today my friends will be there.

Stop it. - Leave me. Let me go. Keep it there. l'm telling you not to take that. - Leave me. Today l'll bash them up. Leave me. - Kichu! Catch hold of him. Take that bottle from his hand. - Leave me. Let me go. Stop it. - Allow me to go. - Give that bottle here. Stop this nonsense. - What is wrong with you? He was going to throw that. - Hey!!!! You did it. You are the real man. Super! Hey! ''My heart is crazy for love. My heart is crazy for love.'' Don't run. Wait. Wait for me also. - Come on. - Don't go.- Nothing l need to sing a song. Just one song. l'm also a young talented guy. Let me also show my talent. lt is not possible here. - Then nothing will be possible here. This is a function that is going on decently. After getting drunk don't create problem here. Else we'll have to call the police. They'll inform the police. - Then you call the police, Secretary. lt is not we alone who are drunk. Let the police come and smell your wife and many of the women here. Look at that sister there. This sister is fully tight. - Yes. - Yes. He just said that he wanted to sing a song. Did he ask you to get your mother and sister married to him? You! - You sing. - l'll start as ''With vermillion in forehead.'' You sing Atmavidyalayame. - That will be good. - Okay. You can go to the stage and sing. You can't sing in this dress. Go and wear pant or jeans and come. Okay. l'll come just now. What is wrong if he sings in this dress? Did you lose your chastity? Talk decently. l'll hit you. - Leave my hand. - You go away. Leave it, leave it. Wait. Wait. None of you leave. Don't go. Hear my song. First you listen to my song and then go. What the hell is he doing? - What kind of a President are you? You don't know how to handle these kinds of anti social elements. lt is you who should be first beaten. - Now you listen to the song. After that you can go. Take off your hands. - You sing. - Thank you! Attention please! This is the famous play back singer John Pollan. That is l'm going to sing a light music here. - Leave me. - Gange!!!!!!!!!! l don't know how to swim. ldiot! The water is only this much. Only 7 minutes remain for 12 o'clock. Make it fast. What ever l had has got sobered. Let me have a peg each fast. Pour one for me too. - How cold it is? Pour one for me too. Pour it fast. Pour it fast. - Where was the beer that was kept here? Beer? - Yes. l had kept it here. Yes, where did it go? - You kept the door open and went. When no one was looking the children must've taken it. - Thank god! They did'n't take the rum. At 12 o'clock what will l splash all over? - That idea is gone. You have this now. Cheers!! Have they called the police? What is there if police comes, first class advocate is here. No fear. Kichu! - What is it? - The velangadan and group have come to hit us. Come. Come fast. - Do we need to fight here? - There is not enough space for all of us. We didn't come to hit you or make problem. Then? - We tolerate all your nonsense. But... But sex racket. That we won't allow here. From when did five people drinking liquor has become sex racket? All of us here are men. Any kind of sex which is against nature is also sex racket under section 377 lPC. There is a woman inside this flat at present. That is for sure. Woman? - What is it? Didn't she go? Here there is no woman or anything. While we were downstairs any of you might have left their.. ..wife here to spoil our name. That l don't know. - Yes. Don't just stand there talking. You go inside and see Velangadan sir. lf any of you come inside without our permission, l'll break his knee. l'll also break his knee. What do you say? Who the hell are you? Are you some cultured police? No need. We'll call the original police. What for? No need to call any police. - What is it? lf there is any one, you tell the truth. - lt is nothing. lf this matter comes out, in bar association they'll talk around saying l did women trafficking. That is why l said that. Why are you hesitating? - What hesitation? Okay. One of you can come with me and see inside. After seeing if you don't find any woman here, l'll bash up the guy who comes inside. l'm sure, sir. - Sir, l'll go inside and see. Come. You are the guy who must see inside. Reason being what ever you desired to get is here. Go. She is here, sir. - Move away. Where? Where? Come here. Are you hiding here? ldiot! Come here. All are some 40-45 years old. They are interested in a young girl. Are you feeling bad? - Get lost. Now what do you say? Let all the decent people of the flat see you. Drinking beer she was hiding there. What all did they say? They'll break the hand, leg. Come here. Why is it that no one is talking now? What are you staring? Look there. Hit me. Hit. Hey! Hey! Kichu! - Hey! - Kichu! - Today l'll show him. No need. No need. Leave it. - Send her out. - No need. Don't send her out in this state. That too being New Year. She can go in the morning. Then at day time we must see this decent guy. Come on. - ldiot! What is this? What? lt is we who should ask you this question. lt is you who should answer it. l know nothing. You ask that devil. - lt is not she. lt is you who should answer us. Without knowing the matter don't do anything wrong. What more is there to understand than this? l don't know how she came inside this flat. Don't you know anything? - Let him say. After that you can hit him. Then you tell. Hey! She is mad. l don't know anything else. - Hit him. Open up. Come out. - l'm telling you l don't know anything. We have always ignored your illegitimate connections with many women. l know nothing about what is happening here. Leave me. Leave me. When they said there was a woman inside why did you hesitate? l was just doubtful. That's all. Promise, l know nothing about this. l'm innocent. Tell us. Tell us the truth. You will again make me cut my veins. You said you'll cut your veins. Here it is. Make it fast. After sometime you might change your heart. What is this we are seeing? - Did you lose your peace of mind? lt is some 5-6 years since l lost that. Today at least l must sleep. Don't make noise. Hey! l'll make noise. l'll make noise. Oh..... l won't let you sleep. Oh.... - Stop it. You get lost. Else let her say what wrong l have done with her. Oh..... Tell us. Tell us. Tell me. Let her tell. Do you want to know what you did to me? Compared to what you did l have done only this much to you. l? With you? With your family people were going to kill you on hearing about your love l got you both married. Was that the mistake which l did? You got us married so that we could live happily. Did you allow that? Not even a single day Kichu can remain without seeing you. Then wasn't it enough for you both to have married? Are you all 16 years old? You put your arms around the shoulder and walk around. You hug and roll around. You jump here and there. ldiots! You are the unsolvable problem of my life. Do you understand? l understood some what. What? - l'm able to understand little by little. The problem is with her and not with Kichu. - We made a mistake by hitting John. No problem. When he hits back you take it. Kichuettan says that l'm his 2nd wife. The first one is his profession. The first one is profession. lt is non living. lt was then that a bearded one of 6 feet came. You are not spoiling our life alone. lt is Kichuettan's profession too. He got so many opportunities. All of them were outside Kerala. l told him so many times that we'll settle in Chennai. What is the name of that place?... What is the name of this place? What is the rent? What is the rent? What is the rent? Hello! l'm calling from Cochin. ln today's Hindu paper l saw one of your advertisements. That only. T. Nagar. What is the rent of that flat? - Oh God! What is it? Tell me. - Nothing. - Whom did you phone? l didn't call any one. - l understood. - Mother! Leave me. - Give that to me. - Kichuetta! What is this? l just phoned. We must know what the rent of a flat in Chennai is. Just for general knowledge. - Oh general knowledge. Are you going to crorepati programme now? lt is not your fault that you were not born as rich. But it is only your fault that you are not becoming rich. So are you not happy now? - l don't lack any happiness. Then it is better that we don't lose what ever happiness we have. l don't understand. My dear! Not only in Chennai were ever l live in a flat l'll lose my peace of mind. Then no need. l'll stop my studies. You sit here, my dear. Like this. Our happiness is like our heart. Do you know? l feel bad thinking about John. That Grace and he are going to give joint petition. For divorce. He is a buffalo. Poor thing. Once he becomes alone he'll have only his friends. What are you thinking? Kichuetta! Tell John to wait for one week. - For what? Before they sign the petition l'll talk to Grace. l'm sure everything will be fine. Did you think l was eager to see you with wife and children? For one week l roamed behind that woman. l thought if everything works out, Kichuettan won't have.. ..to come and sit here on the excuse of your loneliness. That is why. When that didn't happen l had to do all the other things. What all? Priya! Priyakutty! - Yes. Pack all the good T-shirts. - Don't you want any woolen items? Kichuetta! l was about to start. There are only two programmes. One in Chicago and the other in Boston. There it is summer. l can bring only 2 liter. Okay. Fine. Totally it'll take some 12 days. Maximum. l'll be busy. The 12 days that l won't be there will be compensated tomorrow. Full day l'll be with you. Tell them also. No, l'm just starting. How difficult it is? Dear, l may not be back at night. You have food and sleep. Okay. Hello! l could not get it, sir. Sir! lt'll take Sir! That is... Listen... The line got cut. l lost that. Don't cry, dear. Let us think that this was not meant for us. Else in this last moment... - Sorry, Kichuetta! For what? Cool. Jesus! Forgive me. Hello! l had a problem here. l misplaced my passport some where. No. l have not told John. Otherwise also he abuses me saying l'm not careful in anything. You buy a bottle and come to the flat. Let us have a get together. You need not forgive me. l'll bear with that. That will be fine. Okay. Why did you say sorry? You are a busy guy, Kichuetta. lt was my responsibility to keep all this safely. Leave that. ln future you be careful. - l'll always be careful. Why should boys have all the fun? lt is seven years since l left my family. My parents have not come and seen me. Till now. Who do l have? What is my role in all this? Cooking and cleaning? ls it? - No. Next was Madras recording. The flight is at 5 o'clock. lt'll be enough to get up at 3:30. - Who? - John. Why should John wake up at 3:30? - He is also coming. Now it is court vacation time. Poor man. Till now he has not seen recording. What is this? Has he not seen it till now? l have seen so many times. - When? Where? - ln Tv. Sometimes you can see cinemas song recording. Don't sleep. One minute. Have milk and then sleep. - Okay. ls it? Hey! Recording. Vacation. Enough. My stomach is full. Rest you drink. Don't any of you want to see recording? No need? He is roaming around to see recording. Small boy. Which is your date of birth? - For what? Tell me. - June 15th. Do any of you remember the importance of June 12th? vishu. lsn't it? A day when with lot of hard work you all got a marriage conducted. Mine and Kichu's. Dear! That travels people have sent my ticket. You take a print out of that and keep it in my bag. l may forget it. - Okay. When will you be returning? When will you be returning? - Tomorrow. The flight is at evening 4:30. l remember only now. From airport l'll directly go to John's flat and then only come. Do you need to tell me that particularly? There is an importance to tomorrow's date. lt is his birthday. There will be a small get together. He'll feel bad if l don't go. What was particular about day before yesterday? Day before yesterday? What is the importance of that day? June 12th. - June 12th? Oh! Wedding anniversary. God! Fool! Did you at least make me remember? Sorry! lt is okay. Next year we'll have a nice time. Won't John have next year birthday? - Will he die today? l was just joking. Leave it, sir. Let it be any thing. lf you get fish, buy some. Kichuettan is very fond of it. You said that sir has gone to Madras. - You need not enquire about all that. Kichuetta! What happened? Did you miss the flight? Do you know what happened? Not only about canceling the ticket. Do you know what happened before this too? l'm asking you. You have decided to destroy me. l can't avoid being getting destructed. You could have said that you didn't do all this. How can l love you after this? Merlin! We'll give a joint petition. Then? Will you permanently go and stay in John's house? You can go and tell that in some church. For afternoon l have prepared crab curry. You can have food and then go to celebrate John's birthday. You don't remember my birthday. You don't remember the wedding anniversary. You remember John's 28, 56, and 90. You remember everything. l'm waiting for his death day. John? What did John do with you? He is your friend. He might be a poor guy, lonely and everything. But l don't like him. Who do you think is John? - That Rascal! Rascal! John! Drink this. You drink water. You need to listen to the rest. For New Year where is your programme today, Kichu? There is no programme. With friends we have some get together. Then you'll be back only in the morning. Why should boys have all the fun? - Give it here. - Give me. Leave it. Don't drink this. - Let me also know the specialty of this. See the difference. You are so happy with John. With me? Then why did you marry me? You could have married John. - Talk slowly, idiot. lf you make noise, l'll stamp and kill you. Yes, John. l'll call back. Leave it. - Today l'll show you.- Give me. - Leave it. One John. Are you Grace? - You! Don't come near me. l'll throw this on you. Promise, l'll throw this. That must also be that idiot. Are you spoiling my honor, you Devil? - Do you have so much value for your honor? Yes l have. My honor is more valuable than your honor. Okay. l'll finish off that value now. - Then after spoiling my honor you get lost. Kichuetta, please! Don't do anything to me. Kichuetta! l'm an innocent person. Kichuetta! Please! lf you don't want me Kichuetta, you'll never find me here after today. Sure. What ever you say. From here l won't get down even on the road. ls he going to play around in this kitchen whole night? Bava! How long it'll be. - lt is ready. That time itself l told you we'll order from hotel. l'm telling this to all of you. Today l'll bash up all these building guys. One time you tried to die. Why don't you die then? Don't talk nonsense. l won't even think that you are his wife. l'll hit you and throw you out. - Hey! Stop it. l'll die. lt is not a very difficult thing. What is the use for you even if l die? Do you think in this birth he'll be able to love you? That is because you don't know. l did all this due to my hatred for you. No, l did it without realizing. Kichuettan knows well what my wish is. For that your certificate is not needed. l don't know whether it is correct to say like this to a friend's wife. You stupid! What is your problem? - Hey! - Dog! Don't touch me. - Now it is a draw. Do you think what you did is a small thing? What do you think? Do you think what ever idiotic thing.. ..you do he'll forgive you thinking that it is due to the love that you have for him? See here. See this. lt is his death statement. Day before yesterday he had chest pain. He thought he'll die. He made me record this that time. Do you want to hear this? - No need. Leave it. Don't do that. Get lost, you dog. - What more is there to lose? Let her listen. - John, don't do it. He said it believing you. Hearing this if her sickness gets cured let it cure. This is inexpensive shock treatment. You switch that on. Due to any reason if l die here take what l say now as my death statement. Till now what ever l have earned and what ever l.. .. inherited in all that my wife Merlin doesn't have the right of even one rupee of that. You went away from there saying you'll die. ln spite of that he came here sang song and celebrated New Year. He has zero love for you. - John, enough. - Get lost. Then everything is over. lsn't it? lt is you who reached it till here. l don't want to live any more. - No need. You need not live any more. You go and die. There are 4-5 knives in the kitchen. ln bathroom you'll find razor and blade. Under the cot there is a rope. lf all this is not enough, then there is the balcony. This is 9th floor. You jump. Let your brain break open and spread all over. What the hell are you saying this? Have you gone mad? You get lost. Let her die. lf she dies here, the blame will fall on me. No problem. What ever it may be no problem. At least he'll be saved. Don't stand here. Go to Kichu. See whether he is alive or not. l don't think he'll be alive. lf l had been in his place, you would have been waiting in.. .. front of the mortuary like crows sitting on current wire. To take the bundle. To take the bundle of the dead body. Don't stand there. Go and see where Kichu is. What is it, Buddy? Have you not sent that woman till now? l'll kill you today. Are you talking nonsense? Sir, don't hit him. Leave him. What is it, sir? That is Kichu's wife. She had a fight with him. ln that anger she came here to spoil the New Year party. This idiot used indecent words. We can't keep them here any more. With today we must finish them. lt is nothing else. She is in love with him. Don't make her feel sad any more. Try to solve it some how. - For that where has that Kichu gone who knows? He must be lying down drunk some where. - Let Bava find him and then call. Before that she needs counseling. There is no use of threatening and shouting. An emotional approach. - Can you do it? This is a chance. For an emotional performance. - Who am l? Am l Balachandra Menon? Dialogue, action and direction. You need talent for that. - Hey! - What? - She is coming. Where are you going? You didn't come here on our invitation. Now you can leave after we tell you. Sit there. There is no problem which can't be solved. You come and sit, Merlin. Sit down. After he got drunk he must have lost his control. That is why he is talking about this will and all. You need not take that to the heart. Shall l? Sister! Merlin is a good girl. - You write and sign it. Don't spoil the continuity, idiot! lt is lucky to get some good friends. Merlin! We are not such bad people as you are thinking, Merlin. We do have some small faults. For that don't say that we spoilt Kichu's life and profession. lt is a grave accusation. Don't you know Merlin? None of us studied together. We don't work together. Even our age is not the same. We came from different places and got together in this city. As far as we are concerned our friendship and 9D flat is like the pressure cooker nozzle. lt is a nozzle which lets out the daily life's stress, strain and monotony. lt is not a parallel life ignoring the house and family which is happening here. As far as l understood some adamancy, little bit ego and some bad habits. That is what Kichu is. - Cut. Enough. Stop there. Merlin must have seen Thoovana Thumbigal film. You phone Kichu and see. We have not tied him up here. lf your problem is his coming here and seeing me, then l'll stop that today. After this l won't allow him here anymore. l won't see him. Talk to him and l won't phone him. lsn't that enough, sister? What ever you may say Johnetta, Kichuettan will come. lt is like that. l know that. Dear, no one will be able to tolerate this kind of heavy duty love. My God! lt is my wife. What is it? l'm still not able to lift my head. New Year is totally cold. lt is all because of your prayer and offering coming true. My prayer is that not even my enemy should have this kind of New Year. Keep the phone and go. When l feel like l'll come. Kichu is not at home. The house is locked. lt was Bava who called and said. Ask him to check in the bars. - Today being 1st where will you have bar? l have told him to check in the club. Tell all the occupants of the flats to come out. No need to include the children. Police and media will reach here now. ls she still there? - Yes. lf l had not left from there, she won't have stopped the matter there. Else l'll have to come there. l'm not sure whether l'll be able to with hold in front of her. Kichu! What is this? Don't cry. l phoned her father to come and take her. He says he doesn't have a daughter like this. Cruel! A heartless guy. This is my house key. Give it to her. l'm going to Chennai. How will John face the people after this? John will see the face or ass anywhere. ls John your father? ln this concern that you are showing, if you had shown even 10% of it on her all this problem won't have arose. Life is not yours alone. lt is hers too. - That was before. After this she can have her life. Tell her to get the joint petition ready. Else tell John to move accordingly. Without taking off your eyes you keep seeing here. lf they come out, you inform at once. lf Kichu from their gang comes, don't allow him inside at any cost. Okay? - Fine, sir. Move a bit. l have told for the gate to be locked. We'll open only after the police come. Come here. Why take unnecessary risk, President? We'll switch off the lift. We'll put it on after the police come. That is good. Andappa! You go and switch off the power of the lift. Switch off the power of 9D too. - Sir, why don't you avoid an issue? A family will get spoilt. - Then we'll surely end his family life. Yes. We are all living as a family. These people are coming from outside and doing all this nonsense. lt is a good thing to pay them back. - Why is there so much sorrow on your face? Are they your co-brothers? Go and switch it off. Go. The phone is switched off. Call after some time. He is not picking up the phone. Andappa! There is power cut. You switch on the generator. There is a small problem. The current is not gone. Power has been switched off. Outside all the people have surrounded the building. Okay.- What is it? Say what the matter is. That Valangadan and team is spoiling the situation. They've switched off the power for 9th floor alone. They have switched off the lift too. All the bastards of the flats have gathered below. What a problem? lf police comes, the whole situation will go out of hand. Let the police come. What is there? l'll tell them. What will you tell? - That l'm Kichu's wife. To prove that where is your husband? Without your husband in a flat where only men are there what is your job? lf police ask this, what answer will you give? All the people who were here last night are standing there to give witness. What ever we might say they'll arrest us. Then we'll be able to prove only in station or court. Before that the photo will come in TV and paper. ln that a cinema actor is also there. News will flourish. Not only cinema actor. With that Magistrates husband is also there. And High court advocate too. - What nonsense is this? This problem can be talked and solved. lt is that much only. No one can hang us for this. They can't put us in jail for even a day. But the one hour that it'll take from here till there. That one hour's news of arrest and gossip. That character assassination won't leave us in this birth. ln cinema l was always rowdy and used to get beaten. lf this also happens, l'm finished. Mammooty won't allow me to act in any of his movie in this birth. Lalettan is not like that. He'll take it in that spirit. Then you go back to the serial. - No... - Stop it. Your cinema and serial. l'll tell you one thing. lf bad news comes about you in paper, l don't know what stand Kichu will take in your matter. Leave that. You made problem with all these people and made them mad. That is why all this has happened. lf on this name Kichuettan rejects me, l'll write your name and die. You do that. You write my name. - Stop it. lnstead of fighting try to find a solution to this. - lsn't there any way to slip from this? Who made you an advocate? - Your father. lt is Bava. l'll tell him not to come here. Else he'll also get caught. Hello! Where are you? Did you find him? Kichu is in club. - You tell him about the matter here. Before police comes Kichu must reach here. lf he says, it'll be okay. He can say that he and she came here to celebrate New Year. Leave me. Leave. - Kichu, listen to me. - Leave me. You have to come. lt is a problem in which all of us will get caught. You leave me. Even if you cut my throat, l'll not say that. ln front of all those people do you want me to come and stand like an idiot? l'm already half dead after losing my honor. lt will be torrid news. You think about her. - Leave me. You don't talk about her matter. After hearing you all this while my heart literally changed. You said about her innocence and love. lt is all nonsense. lt is all due to her arrogance. She could have left that house and gone in the morning itself. But she stood there to create more problems. Let that devil go and die. What happened? Have the police arrived? They will reach just now. Where are you? By the time he arrives here everything will be over. What do you want me to tell him? He need not come. He won't come. Now did you understand what his decision is in your matter? Are you going to shooting? They are waiting downstairs to take photo. When our face comes in paper why look bad? Hey! Remember one thing. The situation has reached till here due to you and your wife's problem. Leave your wife's matter. On the name of that 3 innocent people are going to lose their honor. Their family life is going to end. You can hang on to your dignity and go to any under ground. What happened? - The police have arrived. We'll go down. - The lift? - Lift and nonsense. Come. Move, move away. Sir, l'm the president. l'm Mathew velangadan. Which is the flat? - 9D. Switch on the lift. - Sir, those four are coming down the steps. They have reached the 7th floor. The staircase is there. All of you stand boldly. Act as if nothing has happened. l'll play a trick. lf it works, it is fine. Come. Why did you switch off the lift? - They told me to do so. Just because they say will you switch off the lift, idiot? Has the association paid a salary for this and kept you here? Stop there. - Who is this woman? This? This is Merlin. My friend's wife. Kichu's wife. l'm Advocate John Pallan. - They are saying it just like that, sir. She is a prostitute. - lt is your wife who is a prostitute. lf you talk nonsense, l'll slap you with slippers. Wait, wait. When did you come in this flat? - Yesterday. Alone? - No, with my husband. - Where is he? He left in the morning. He has to go to Chennai in the evening. He has some purchases to do. ls it a crime to go for purchase? They are lying, sir. That Kichu left the place yesterday night when all the people gathered. lt is true. - Yes, we saw. Who the hell are you to say that? - Leave me. Enough. Enough of it. l can't wait till you show your marriage certificate. This entire people are unitedly saying this. There is a complaint from the association side. We can't remain without arresting you. Rest you can say in station. Get in the jeep. Kichuettan! Hubby! Sir, that is Kichu. He works as drummer in A.R.Rehman's troup. Are you the husband of this lady? - Velangada! With the animosity of yesterday, you've come out. Aren't you? See this ATM card, sir. This is a joint account with my wife. This confusion is because he didn't get beaten up. Yesterday night during the New Year celebrations, we had a tussle with him. The problem was that, his wife in an inebriated condition was a nuisance and abusing. He reprimanded him saying he must bring her under control. On that account some of them under the influence of alcohol came to our flat to beat us. We've avoided that, purposely. When his wife is with him, he won't allow any nuisance, sir. Ok. Ok. Stop. l have seen you in films. l have also heard of advocate. Yes. Who are you? l am... - Tell him, man. He is the husband of Judicial First Class Magistrate, lndhumathi. He works in the RDO office, here. - Sorry, sir. - lt's ok. Sir! They may be big shots. - Shut up! You should've been.. put under bars. Botheration to the police. Come! We shall go. - What to do? Get lost before getting beaten up. - Get lost, before beatings. Where are you going, before we come to a decision? l'll produce the decision. - Why are you beating me? - Go in. Get lost all of you. - What are you? The King? To wander like this with a crown? Go inside. Take this. The key to the home. Hey! Rascal! Are you trying to thrust on me something that you don't want? Are you talking nonsense? - You can have anything you like. Do you want to thrust her on me, when you've neglected her in your death will? Kichuetta! No! No! Hey! You've become mad to beat me. - Leave me. Come. Let us go. ls it not enough, sister? What is this, pal? Why can't we all have a small? lt is still New Year. ls it not? Recording at Madras.
