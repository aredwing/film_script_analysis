"Sticks it in", Solis Yes, sir. Why does he look like that? Uh sir, Torrente said he'd wear his Sunday best. Well, I've seen shit dress up better than your friend there. Not big on classical? Classical is "The Candy Man", this sucks. - Back to France! - I'm Bulgarian. What, you want pity? Hey what's this? A spread of mousse, nuts and cream of foi with crispy licorice, sir. How stuck-up is that? What no Tootsie rolls, pork rinds, chips? This wedding blows. Where did you dig up this slimeball? Don't let him fool you, Oswaldo, Mr.Torrente -is highly recommended. - Yeah, by you. Whaddaya got? McCallan or Cardhu. Here we go store brands Serve me a bit of both. Jerk. An officer with prestige, years of service on the force, and, most vital lots of poise. What a work of art I don't know who I like more: grandma or granddaughter. You're amazing, madam for your age, that is. Were it not for the huge respect I have for you and because I'm personally in charge of wedding security, I'd do you a favor right here and now. You are a crude man. Enough or I call security What are you saying? I am security, ha ha. Who could you be safer with than yours truly, ma'am? Your granddaughter has your lashes, your nose... ...and your my God, what nipples! They resemble a pair of missles. Come here! Tell him to go the fuck home, hide him wherever, but if I see him here again, you'll both be out on the street. - Understand? - Understood, Oswaldo. Right away. Hey! This isn't a whorehouse. Sorry, I have work. - Not so fast. - Let me be. Let's see ooh, laughing powder - I'm security. - What? I have no choice but to report this regrettable incident. Oh, please, don't tell my father! Sorry, but it's my job. Please! Well, perhaps I could... ...look the other way. Fabulous wedding for your daughter, Rocamora. A kid only yesterday. Don't let it dry up. Give it some spit, let it slide, let that baby slide, yeah. Regarding those matters, I hope we don't end up angry with each other. No I won't get angry, I'll just cover my back and defend whats mine. Hey, you bit the head with one of your teeth Swallow, use some technique, try the Peter Pan move. Deep, ring that bell. Like Greek yogurt, eh? It's Spanish goat cheese. Cream rises! Uh, Torrente! C'mon in, there's plenty more! Where you going I was half done! Man, why didnt you get some? Jos Luis, you're gonna get me in deep shit, they'll fire me, and with the crisis and all I can't allow it, Jos Luis. Look, kid, you're offending me. I only took a second to be human with the girl, doesnt mean I wasn't doing my job, or wasn't on full alert. I'm in total control shit! What were you guys doing when I walked in? It was the Peter Pan move ...? Nothing gets by you. Shh I think the curtain just moved. Look, Torrente, look what we have here! This'll make 'em happy. A "par-apache". Hand over the roll, now! What roll? This camera's digital. What digital? You think I'm stupid? The roll or you're mush. OK, alright, here it is. You shitting me? Not the battery. Jerk your mom off. No, no, Jos Luis, the pictures are inside. - I had a vision. - What did you see? - it's only for you - Yesss! Nothing and no one will ruin this wedding. Paparazzi, paparazzi paparazzi! Jos Luis! Prick! Watch him, he's slippery. Outta here! Get him, Jos Luis! Back here, you twit! Torrente, you're screwing things up! Get outta here! You're making things worse. You're creating a scene. Come back, for Chrissake! Come here! It's security! Security! Security! It's a paparazzi! - There, good, good! - Jos Luis! Don Jos Luis! Daddyyyyy! TORRENTE IV: Lethal Crisis Since you passed on, things arent the same, Fary. Spain has gone to the dogs. The whole world is on the fritz. Queers can get married now, the Socialists have flushed Spain down the tubes, and in the White House, there's a jungle bunny, but not a cleaning man, no he's the president! It's like a joke. What's next, a broad? Yeah, I know we won the World Cup last year, but that doesnt count. Most of the players were barely Spanish. What do you think? Never mind. Your spirit and music will always be with us. Damn! Looks like I gotta take a dump, Fary. Some timing, huh? Sorry, Fary. At your service or should I say mine. You see: the dead get flowers and the flowers get fertilizer. Shame on you! Have you nothing to say? Have a Kleenex handy? OK, ifs the flowers then. Hey, cutie! When's the next meal? Two o'clock. Torrente long time no see! Hey, Cuadraclo, what are you doing around here? Trying to get by, as you can see, like everybody else. I'm in such a slump, if you only knew. No need to say anything, it's pretty obvious. Here, I'll get you in. Give me a break, that's all I need. Think I need charity or welfare? Sorry didnt mean anything. Some of us still have class not hard-up like this rabble. Hardly any meat left, used to be better. All these people like after the civil war. Damn, kid, beat it! What are you doing here anyway? Get the tuck outta here! I was here first. No manners, no nothing. Roasted pork, with the skin still on it too. People leave the best, then they cry poverty. Kids, didn't I tell you to scram! What uh, would you like some? I was wrapping up here, I'll pass on dessert. Serve yourself, boys enjoy! Hey, Blondie! Jules, you're better every day. Hey, girls! I'm working. - Who, me? - Come here a sec. Hey, what's your name? My name is Rin-Rin, well, my real name is Julito, but my dad sold alarm clocks, so the kids re-named me. That's a good one. Uh could you spare a couple of euros for the booths? - I left my wallet home. - Uh, no! Know who I am? Not really. Of course not. I'm Torrente. Jos Luis Torrente. Here, keep it. Have you heard about Operation Woxter Asia? - Later Woxter Hong Kong. - No. I directed it entirely, the whole shebang. Go ahead and ask around the hood! I even got a medal. I was Number 1 on the force for ages. Then I quit, now I do only top-of-the-line P.I. work. Two euros, I just wanna beat off. I'll pay you back tomorrow. It's not like I need it. I'm loaded. - Really? - Yeah, dude! Cool! Getting filthy rich is my dream. I'd spend it on babes, what I'd really like. Sorry to interrupt, bud, but the one I like just came out. Jos Luis Torrente. Secret Agent. - Hey, mister! - What the...? - Am I bothering you? - Isn't it obvious. Madam, am I disturbing? Leave my wife out! Who's talking to you? Lady, did I offend you? Have I been obnoxious? You're stunning, madam, you're an exotic beauty. Maybe a tad sad, like something's missing. Perhaps your husband isn't? Kid, your mom and dad dont - If you don't leave - Manolo, please! - Don't butt in, Encarni! - He's sort of right. - Encarni! - Encarni-schmarni, I don't get enough! My wife says that and there's hell to pay. Good for nothing, you ain't worth a dime. - Shut up! - Manolo, it's my mom. - Mini dick! - I was known as "Anaconda"! - Worm dick! - Wanna see my worm dick? Time for a peek at the worm, it's show time! - Peek? - Manolito! Let me go! - You're crazy! - I'm dandy. - Always a scene. - Bug off! Hey, no scenes! - What scene? - Please leave. -I wanna show her. - Sir, please leave. - Mom, let's go don't touch me - Leave me, get your hands off me! Run or you'll wind up an orphan. Marital bliss, dear God. The witch, the wicked witch! Where's the broom, your broom? Salaam malecum, poromperooo. Want some wine, eh? If you want wine, then give me your "meat", "meat", lots of meat. What the fuck? I swear on my fucking what kind of shit is this? - Sorry, Mr. Torrente, sorry. - Pacheco! Pacheco! Didn't I expressly say my room was off limits to Jesus himself? Problem is we're nearly 30, in only 53 square meters. So? Two meters per person! It's not like you pay enough to live in Buckingham Palace! Speaking of money, it's been a bad month. We only have half. We haven't earned... Whoa, don't even go there! Pay up or I'll kick all your butts out! Fuck you all! Follow? Torrente, give us a few days. How about I give you a swift kick? What's up, Pacheco? Hand it over! Now get ready for this - Lady, my money! - No, my money! And, by the way, I've reported you. The back rent I let slide, but this subletting scam. What subletting? The flat is filthy as hell and packed with illegals. I'm ted up. What are you talking about? My cousins from the islands are visiting a few days. Excuse me, one question: is this where they rent rooms? Oh, this is too much! - These spics took the wrong stairs. - Yeah - We're looking for Mr. Torrente. - There he is. These people come with drugs stuffed in their asses, the bags explode, then they all go nuts. Go ahead, go in. OK, that's enough. Good morning, people! How's everybody? - Good morning, Torrente. - Hey, what's up? What's new, Tony? No "top-of- the-morning" to a regular? No more freebies, Torrente, you owe me 36 "euros" in whisky. Hold up, Tony. Are we or are we not good buddies? Give me some churros and a Sol y Sombra. Torrelavega will pay. - I've paid dozens of times. - I left my wallet somewhere. Well, Damian will pay then. What the fuck? What do you think? I'm the Bank of Spain? No way. Perhaps that gentleman in the rear will pay. He's been looking for you. - Sit down. - Thanks. Okay, I understand, you've been looking for me? That's right, Ramirez spoke highly of you. - Ramirez spoke highly of me? - You might say so. I won't beat around the bush. The job we want done can't be executed by just anyone. A subtle piece of investigation, I take it. Not exactly, it's a delicate matter. It wouldn't be illegal, would it? It's totally illegal. You have to kill someone. Shit! Whoa, kill someone Ramirez, perhaps he's the wrong man. Wait, wait, wait, if I have to kill, I kill. - It wouldn't be the first time. - So you have experience? I was on the force for quite a few years. Where public safety is concerned, pulling the trigger is a fact of life. This would be different. It would involve killing in cold blood. If the money's right, I'll kill every 8 hours, before every meal, like taking antibiotics. Perfect, say no more. It must look like an accident. There's a picture inside. In the envelope, you'll find his address, schedule and habits, and a small advance for expenses. Thanks, that's very kind of you. Splendid. Hey, could sambo over here give me a lift? I'm pretty far from my neighborhood. Hey, brownie, open up. In Colombia and third world countries from the third world, they'll kill you for a watch, and in some places for a crust of bread. Luckily, we're in Spain, where a person's life has higher value. They said they'd pay 30.000 euros for this job. Fifty million pesetas in old currency! I'm ready to split it with whoever lends a hand. Needless to say, all that I've said here will remain in the strictest and absolutest confidence. - Is that clear? - Yes Great. Dismissed! Look, the graffit idiots. Hey, Torrente, count on us to kill that guy for you! Right on, Torrente. He'll feel our pain! It's impossible to keep a secret in this country. Stop, damn it, stop! Hey, let me go! Let go of me, please. Hey, wait a second! What's up? - What's up? - He was jerking off. You gotta pay for that! Okay, take it easy, this kid was relieving himself, as part of his undercover work as my assistant. Who the hell are you? Who am I? I'm Jos Luis Torrente. Have you never heard of Operation Woxter Hong Kong? We're working on a case of illegal immigration and sex slavery. So watch it, girls. If you don't want to be part of a roundup, you'd better split, move! Bastard, slimedick! Thanks, Torrente. You're the best! Dont mention it, kid. Why were you on the street relieving yourself like a clog, with two Latin chimps to boot, "Din Don"? It's Rin Rin,Torrenle. I was horny and was broke. Women are just too much for me I mean hookers. Right. Money and broads. The 2 euros you lent me will be the best investment of your lite. People who hang with me usually get very lucky. I give people luck. I'm like a rabbit's foot. - You plan to pay me back? - Don't be silly. You've got to get rid of that mop. Mops are for homos. I plan to quit, but there's no other work. It's obvious I could've done this job alone in my sleep. The thing is the mastermind of an operation must never soil his hands. That's why you're here, you're my go-to crew. I want to know who-knows- what about executions. Let's see, for example, this Let me see, who thinks this weapon is lethal? Yeahhh no? Wrong! Too obvious! This? With that "brick", Torrente, you could do real damage. Wrong again, Rin Rin. You're not too bright. Who has a metro ticket? This, this is a deadly weapon. This in the right hands could sever the jugular vein of any attacker. Find something funny, Popi? Come on, attack me! Fuck your family! How can I kill anyone with this? It expired. Stop complaining! It was a clean cut, an inch higher and your carotid is kaput, leaving you mumbling the story. Torrente, don't be a pig! It doesnt kill, it only stuns. Who else wants a whiff? The five of us will go by car to the El Campillo housing development the victim's home is there. Pochito will watch the north route, Chancletas, the south. Popi and Rin Rin, the gate. There you'll aid Rin Rin, who'll be the go-to guy and I'll strategically wait in the car. Rin Rin, where-'s my boy? Narciso, haven't I told you a thousand times to steer clear of riff raff? - But, Juani - Shut shut up, before I slap you one. I already forbid you from being anywhere near my boy. - Mom! - Take that! Don't back-talk me! Madam, do you know you're interrupting a vital operation? Who's this fat pig? Why are you with these boys? - You some "pedophiliac"? - Lady! Mom, ifs Torrente. I said: Shut up! Let's go home, what did they do to you? Shameless trash, and you get on home! You too, Rin Rin! Get ready, because when I see your mom, I'm telling and you two little bastards, I'm telling on you tool Torrente, I gotta go and change grandpa's diapers. -Count on us - Keep us informed. There are no men left, kid. Today's youth has no balls. - What do we do, Torrente? - Follow the plan. I just realized you and me can do the job alone. We don't need anyone. That way we get a bigger share of the loot. The truth is, Torrente, we haven't discussed the "loot" part yet. Everything has its moment. When we pull the job, we'll see. I was thinking of something fair, like 90/20, something you'd feel easily comfortable with I thought more like 60/40. Have you gone mad? You should pay me for the privilege of my company! I should charge you for letting you be near me. Torrente, no Look, don't piss me off with this trivia. Who cares about bucks, as long as I get mine? We're going to spend the whole advance. Great, Torrentel Sol say Manolito, put it on my tab but leave the bottle. Torrente, I've got a black pussy thirsty for some milk. No used goods, I have money. I want hotties! But Russian chicks are frigid. And Spanish chicks: clingy, ugly and wear mustaches. C'mon, get out of here! Hey handsome, wanna have a good time? OK. - Torrentel - Gotcha! Don't be disgusting! Caught you napping! A cup of insert it ammo methane bam! Works every time! The girls left, now what? Ah, what the Babes just don't get it. They lack our sense of humor. -sum -Pig! Shh, they may come back. I'm gonna tuck all the sluts in this joint, another round Excuse me, would you accompany me? Are you throwing me out? - More or less - C'mon, I may lose it This is the worst part of surveillance, kid. The down-time, I mean what do you do? Should we try or Crosswords? What if we jerk off 50-50? You mean each other? No, Torrente, to each his own. Monogamy strikes again! Kid, this is to honor the manhood of a fellow mate. - Your pizza - Torrente, my pizza's here. - You ordered a pizza? - I'm starving. BBQ-flavor, want some? You're crazy, you're not too well, kid. This is the scene of the crime. How could you order a pizza? Look, Torrente, the hookers are leaving. At least this guy is gonna die happy. - Come on - Let's go. Right, kid, now let's follow the plan. You'll see how easy it is. And up we go! Look, Torrente. I love easy money, babes and them kinds of things, but killing killing someone I just can't I can't. Ripping off a leg, an arm What are you babbling about? I just get this stirring inside. it's like a panic attack, Torrente. I never even killed a fly. Faggot! I'm gonna end up doing it myself. Look, you stay in the car, be on the lookout. Hank the horn if you see anything. - Come on. - Don't worry And away we go! Watch from the car! What a fright okay, the dog's on a chain. Son of a bitch Police! Don't move! Murder One! Whatever you say may be used I have my legal rights! Let me go, it's a mistake! You've made a mistake. You're making a mistake Well Everyone out! ALHAURIN DE LA SIERRA STATE PRISON Leave items in the basket, then move on to the booths for a strip search. Let's go -I was a cop once. - Right. - The old kind, old school. - Shit Can I keep this calendar? Look, when you suck on the panties, you can see her snatch. Leave that crap too. Let's go! Come on, come on. Joaquinesss Jos Luis. Don't you recognize me, Jos Luis? I'm Gregorio, your uncle. What are you doing here? Uncle Gregorio. They told me you were dead. Naturally, I'm the black sheep of the family. My mother, your grandma, may she rest in peace, told me how well you were all doing. I was so proud. Especially of you. Best cop on the force. Number 1 in his class. Here everyone knows the class nephew I have. How many in here did you send to the Slammer? I see you did tell everyone. We don't like coppers here. You'll eat your share of shit. Here, kid - Want some? - Nah - it's quite a zoo. -Yeah. Gotta keep both your eyes open. All talk, they're good kids. Fucking pig! Now your fate is in our hands. You just wait, Fats! Easy, the forks are plastic. Sure, no sweat. Everybody, calm down! As long as I'm here, nobody messes with Gregorio's nephew, is that clear? Wait here You defend this stinking pig? Hey, I'll slice you up! Motherfucker, I'll kill you! Those are brass balls! Mr. Gregorio you're like a father to me in here. So, I'm like your cousin. Torrente, while I'm here, nothing will happen to you. Great, that's very reassuring because I have a certain - Peralta, it's you again. - What, why me? Torrente! If you need anything, I'm your man. Good to know, good to know. Let go, assholes! How do you score, "Teeth"? Women like men who know how to dress, with style, culture, a good complexion. That's why I'm a hit with the bitches. Hey "lvlustache", don't be putting things in my ear. What do we have here, a queens convention? Let's see, wiseguy, you haven't seen my buds when they get fired up? Not lately, no. - Listen, look, I - No, you look. The jail's full of fairies, but who knows I might enjoy having a fat and ugly one with a droopy ass like yours. The thing is: I fuck anything. My ass is sacred, ifs like a temple. Nothing gets in. A fart escapes now and then, maybe even a fine sausage Don't wanna mess up my pipes. Maybe you need to open your door some. Dilate it, open it a crack. Boys, boys, boys! What do I always say: Hand games are bad man games. Come on, see you in awhile, in the showers or Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go. Go to the yard and play with your mates. So, you're one of the new ones. Already making friends. Father, those people were homosexuals. And killers too. They carry knives. I'll report them to the proper authorities. Do you think the Lord would welcome your being a snitch? You're a good Christian I get the impression you're a benevolent man, with a great heart I'm never wrong. Would you like to partake in the prison parish activities? You mean praying and all that? No, not praying. Don't be silly. Together like brothers, members of a church Together we're walking to see Christ our Lord Oh Loooooooooord, If I hook ya, gonna fuck ya Father! What do you think? Wrote it for my missus who's as bad as they come, but I love her sick. Right, very good, very nice, Joaquin. You'll come to realize God didn't give you this calling. Perhaps you should return to playing sports in the yard or arts and crafts, that sort of stuff. What are you saying, Father? Fuck that shit! I'm outta here, damn shithead! Boys! Joaquin is no longer with us! Right on, Father only those who know how to sing can stay. What a bitch, so they set you up, eh? You said it it's a heavy charge. I gotta get out of here, to clean my honor and get revenge. There must be a way. There-'s a prisoner: "Colibri", the humming bird. He's been planning an escape digging a tunnel for years. He's almost finished Maybe, if I talk to him This, this is the cell. It cost me smokes to see him. How do you do it, uncle? You maneuver like you're at home. It's been many years, my boy. What a guy! Let's go. I told you. Freedom is right here. Always a pussy involved. A creature, I saw a That's no creature, it's a man. This is "Colibri". What the fuck? Hi, Mr. Colibri. My name is Jos Luis Torrente. A pleasure. "ML Colibri" Fuck me and my fucking rep. Three years of digging with a spoon for this Hey, come on, don't be like that. This man would drown in a glass of water. He-'s small enough. Today, I finally reached the end, and what do I see through the hole? The end of the tunnel is right right below the wall where the guards patrol. Don't tell me you drew the map wrong? Never happen to me. You miscalculated. You gotta pay special attention to height and angle, that's it. Gregorio, make him disappear before I rip his eyes out! What could I do? Here's this Cuban eyeing my girl's ass, saying I love you baby, I wanted to hit him, which is what i did, that's what I did, Torrente. Instead of receiving a medal, I got sent here like a criminal. It's not not fair. No, it isn't. What why are you in jail? I killed a man! He must've done something to piss you off. Yeah, he looked at me. I know how to do it Like they did it in "Victory" with Stallone. You know that World War I flick? They were in a "consecration" camp, and played a match against the Nazis, escaping at halftime. Movies are not my thing. But it premiered after 1972 It was a huge hit! Anyway, we'll do it too. We'll organize a big match, a real spectacle of rivals, Atleti-Real Madrid! Against the guards. And escape through the tunnel. He's bright, huh? We'll need a car outside But I got that covered, don't worry, I have a team of professionals. Very nice, Manolito, they look real. You look like someone else. Are the lashes yours? No, I put on a little makeup. - Bring the ...? - Yes, Torrente. Super, it's key. Yes, sir. I need to tell you the exact date and time of the match. Jos Luis and Maruja Soler pass to the visitors' quarters. You have 15 minutes. Here you are, hurry up! You wouldn't believe what it took to get that thing in, and to pull it out I decided to Tie a string to it like a Tampax. Here it is. What the fuck - What shit is this? - Mine. Let's see, you inserted that in there unwrapped? Believe me it wasn't easy. You wanted it gift-wrapped? No, man, just a little plastic, cellophane, something The important thing is that it has a battery and it works. I tried it, it buzzes. I'm sure you spent half the afternoon calling yourself. You say the darndest things! Come on, wrap it up! We'll need a car right away. - Be ready for my call -Yes, sir. Uh, Torrente, since we're already here, do you want me to Say what ...? How can you be such a degenerate? Mr. Castano, it's a pleasure and an honor to be in the office of a Real Madrid supporter. I saw you out of respect to your uncle, dean of prisoners here but let me tell you from the outset that arranging a match won't be easy. Here, the rabble uh, the prison population, lacks camaraderie and sportsmanship. You're tighter than right. It's a question of motivation. I'm just the person to inculcate in these people the competitive spirit. You know, I I was a junior player for Real Madrid when I was a kid. They called me the Dark Arrow, say no more. What memories What a time. It just occurred to me Why don't you personally manage the guards' team? Manage, at my age? You tempt me, Torrente You tempt me. - Skipper, me me! - Nah, I want stars, stars Nothing but wannabes here Historically, South Americans just aren't good at soccer. Look at him, he's got a nice touch. Gimme a break, man. He's black. So what? Wasn't Pele black? He was the best player of all time. - That's true. - Right. Let' see. Hey, boy, Bimbu, bimbu, Ankawa, ale! Again the cops I no just arrive, I Spanish! Spanish! Fuck me! Pirate DVD, I no know. I friend. Soccer, you like soccer? Play with monkeys, back in jungle? He understands "nada". Throw him the ball Ball. Fuck, he does have a touch. Give him a pack of smokes, he's on our team. Bumbu, bumbu, guay Come here, come on Don't be afraid, dude! Fight, tactics, freedom, feeling, yeah Team spirit The ol'red-and-white! - Peralta, please. - Yes, sir. Let's begin with some technique "Mustache", "Teeth", go! Some respect, damn it. You act like kids! Come on, listen up a bit, the We have fake strikers, fake backs, we got 'em all. Above all, we have fake defenders. The only authentic guy is the goalkeeper. We'll play the "fake-out". Coach, why not use two strikers and attack from the sides? This way the midfield will be in closer too. Look kid, shut up if you have nothing to say. Respect experience. Hey, you're off the team Get outta here! Bastard. Hey Torrente, Iet's play "Tiki-Taka". Can someone translate? - Mr. Castano. - What? - How goes it? Coaching eh? - Looks like it. Where was I this kid haven't I seen him before? He's my nephew. So he's not a staff employee? No, he-'s studying for a civil service job, but let's not get all bent out of shape over players now. After all, it is a friendly match. We're gonna crush you! Hey! Shave it! There he is! He's Bazooka Boy, Torrente! Bah, lighten up He lacks technique. He-'s all brute strength. Boom! I may not know too much, but I do know how to train. Are we men or are we queers? Come on, let's go! Move, go, go! Yeah, you're machine! Up, up, there you go! That's it, very good! No pain lift that black ass, move that rear, that's it, keep it up! Alright, sprint, sprint! - 5, 6, 7! - There you go! Yeah, let's go! Very good, very good I'm strong as an ox. Don't worry about me. You don't worry me, I only worry that if you insist on coming with us you endanger the operation. Baloney, Jos Luis, you won't even know I'm here. OK Dioni, what are you staring at? The bikes. - I thought vans were your thing. - They were. -Jos Luis Torrente? - That's me. - I was looking for you. - Me? We've heard that you're the most virile prisoner, the best hung here. Yeah, a real sex machine! My reputation precedes me. My friends and I would like a sample demo. A demo, huh? You'll have to earn it. Strip and dance for me like disco sluts. Eenie meenie, miney moe, check the ass out on this hoe Don't care for this one. This one's like a peach full of fuzz and all. Take that thong off and join me in the cell. Ooh, oh, let's go, yeah! Grrrr, Joaquiness! With your shit backed up, I figured you need a massage. Wait a moment, you don't look so hot. I'm OK, I just had a nightmare. Cheer up, okay? If all goes well tonight, we-'II soon be free men doing a few lines, banging bitches right and left, popping pills like mad, Torrente - Like normal people. - Great. I like you optimistic. Here, make a call. Why me? - It doesn't bite. - I don't wanna ... -Take it. -Okay. Careful! -Tony -Tony it's in "contacts". Man, this smells, Torrents-I What do you want? It smells like a phone. Damn! It's Bakelite, which has a special smell. - Bakelite - Yes, Bakelite. You just don't know it. That team looks like thunder rolling in They're so cute A killing machine. Probably recruited locally to intimidate us. Amateurs! I bet if you threw the ball at them they'd run for cover. Let's throw 'em a beating. Show them who we are! Let's go, kill 'em! Come on! Let's go, cheer the boys on! You're our side? Alright, okay, alright Those should be banned. Illegal footwear, too phosflourescent, they blind my players! Come on Joaquiness! Way to go! Fucking hell! Hell of a goalkeeper What foosball game did we get him from? He's your "find", T! Hey ball-hogs, pass me the ball. I'm all alone here! Don't sweat up a storm Don't sweat Now, let's split, kid. How can we leave the bench? lt'd look suspicious, Torrente. You're right Well, even a master plan has its flaws. I have an idea. Goikotxoa! Hey, you're Basque, right? From Bilbao. You like violence? Look, you're gonna kick the black guy with all your might. But, he's on our team! You never see the big picture. I'm the strategist, not you. How about following orders without a word? Go, pick him up. Right. Did you see that tackle? Damn, it was criminal. - A red card, at least. - It was your guy. Well, the injured must go to the infirmary. Don't worry, one of the guards can do it. Do you know any Atletico player who'd abandon his men? You just don't want to see the massacre. Okay, go ahead, it's obvious you can't stand the humiliation. Go, go on We'll have to leave "this" somewhere. Here, here There. They broke my leg, Torrente, my leg is broken, man! Look you black bastard, don't be a crybaby, I know injuries and it's only a sprain. Two days of rest and Arsenal will sign you! And stop yelling, people are taking naps. Let's go. Everything's ready. The game-'s at fever pitch. In daylight, this looks a lot smaller. It looks kid-size. An average person can't fit in there. Of course an average person can fit in there. I do. What doesn't fit is a fat slob like you. Oh, insults now? You see I distract the guards, arrange for a car at the door and he disses me. Stop arguing. It you want, I'll go first, just in case. Going first is always risky. Shut up, go in, uncle. - Shall I go? - Come on. -Go Gregorio! -Go! Ahhh, let's go shit Okay, uncle, everything's cool. Now Peralta, careful Let's go. Bye bye birdie! - Watch it with my ass! - Right, I got nothing better to do. Fucking midget moron! I don't know if I can borrow the van again. So we go in Tony's car. No one touches my car! They tried to involve me in their escape. Naturally, I had no idea. Jesus, how could I let them lead me on or be so blind? At least we stopped the breakout. That, plus we mauled your team. It was a tragedy. I tried to convince them not to, but they beat me badly. That's why I brought Escamilla, one of our finest men one of our men to watch over you night and day. With your permission, I have to join the boys in our victory celebration, you know. Father, I can't seem to get out of my head all those people buried in the rubble, asphyxiated, all dead. Well, not all, luckily, Gregorio survived. My Uncle Gregorio, Uncle Gregorio. Thanks for saving him, Lord Despite being the instigator and mastermind After all that's happened, he is still family. -Jos Luis lies. - Tries? - Tries what? - Doesn't tell the truth. Probably begging for drugs. He had a habit. - He's incredibly bad. - Someone's glad. - Mother fucker. - He said "mother fucker". - He lies - Air - He can't breathe. - He needs mouth-to- mouth. - Be my guest. Airrr ... The light, uncle, follow the light, seek the light. We-'re nothing. My son, I know this is a difficult moment and ifs okay if you say no, but tomorrow are the Inmate Choir Regionals. We'd love to count on you and your voice. How can you be so heartless at a time like this? My uncle is still present. When does the bus leave? Okay, okay, okay. Very good, boys. Alright, okay, fine thanks. It was really quite hard to get "leave" passes for the choir competition. Li's paramount we exhibit manners and the best behavior we're capable of. Hey Montanilla, have you no shame? Apologize to Father Tobias right now! You should all learn from Jos Luis. His voice is fair, but he's found a niche here, thanks to his team spirit and Christian ways. Thanks Father, learn from me. Let's sing! What joy when we discovered we were bound to see the Lord Look, Montanilla, when ifs your turn to do the solo, don't put on that crow's face. It doesn't suit you. Very, very ugly. Father, I don't mean to when I concentrate, this is my face. Father Tobias is still giving ii a shot. Wait till we beat the shit out of your singing chimps. Father, there's a real spiritual feeling among the clergy here. He's just a jealous member of the Piarist Order. Don't worry, Father. I've seen the boys rehearse a bit and they don't stand a chance. I know. Before we begin, I just wanted to ask a favor: I gotta crap. You're too much. Leave it to you to always come up with something. "Opening night" jitters. Go to the bathroom, let's see if your voice clears up. I'll go with you. Okay, right What are you guys in for -- singing? Leave the door open. I'm planning to unload a big one, so be advised. Okay, close the door. But no funny stuff, I'm a quick trigger. Relax, one dump and I'm out. Boys, we follow the plan. We're down here, Torrente. You through? Open up or I'm coming in! Fucking shit! Stop or I shoot! Fucking - Run, Torrente, run! - Wait up! Torrente, we'll never forget you. - Run, Torrente! - Wait! Pull me up! Pull me, pull! - Pull me! - Pull the chain. Hold on, Torrente! Who the fuck is driving? How're we doing, Torrente? We' re fucked! We have a shotgun. What's this? This is only good for supermarket holdups. You're wrong, it packs a wallop. I filmed it all on my cell. Wanna see? Not now. Come on, more cartridges. We only brought one. I don't believe it! Let's head to the gas station. They won't shoot at us there. Right, we'd all go up in smoke there. Civil Guard on the grill! Fill 'er up. Torrente, what are you doing here. Weren't you in jail? Shh, bitch, I'm incognito. My black pussy is thirsty for milk. Not that pussy again! It stinks, it must be dead by now. - I'm seeking information. - Will the yellow pages do? Isn't she funny my sweet little honey? I'm looking for Rin Rin, that kid who hangs out with me. You mean the mongoloid-looking one who could be a relative of yours? Uh I don't know You' re all leeches! Here, take that it's almost 2 euros! Your friend's up there in one of the rooms. Why's he doing that? Hey, the door! There you are! So, Judas, spending all you got for selling me out? I can explain, you got it all wrong. No need to explain. Come here, come here. You shit - Excuse me, ladies. - Who's that? -Very nice. -Again! - It'll be worse if you run. - Torrente, don't be crazy! The race is over. Don't get any closer, I'll jump. I swear on my mother! No need to jump, I'll push you off. I didn't do anything wrong. Oh shit, I'm scared stiff. -You sold me out. - It was more of a rental. "Rental"? Come here. Come here, kid! What are you doing? You're breaking one of my ribs! I'll bash your head! I was broke, I didn't imagine you in jail. What you didn't imagine was me breaking out. What are you doing? Like we used to be, remember? We did it anywhere. Oh, hush up! Torrente, I'm sorry. I regret what I did, really. You wretched shit! At least tell me who ratted on me. I don't know! All I know is Ramirez paid me off, but not who he works for That we're gonna find out right now! You don't know how bad I felt these days. You're like an idol to me. And, of course, I thought: what would Torrente do? Look, kid, how much money did they give you anyway? At least 3.000 euros. Couldn't turn that down. Torrente, have I ever told you that I love you? Yeah, well, truth is I kind of like you too. - Give me a hug, Torrents! - Don't go gay on me, that's all I need. What's this, Torrente? "Friends of Ecuador"? Yeah, we're here for my gun. This place is tighter than a virgin's pussy. You leave for 3 days and they go nuts. What, not again? You've gone too far! Sorry, Mr. Torrente, weren't you in the slammer? I mean, "on holiday". Look, he was jerking off to a photo of yours. It's true, that's me. Where did you get this? The computer's mine, I'm a programmer. I came across the memory card in that drawer by chance. So that was a real roll of film, after all Now what we came for. Don't shoot, sir, I beg you, in the name of Baby Jesus. I'll do what you want Right now, shut up. You make me nervous. Take it easy, these bullets already have a name carved on their skin. That carved name must be the brand, Torrente. And it's a chassis, not "skin". Bullets don't really have skin. - He's half-jerk, huh? - This kid's a retard. Oh, darling why didn't you tell me you invited friends for dinner? - Friends, what friends? - See I told you, madam, he's forgetful. Well, Torrente Heavens to Betsy what brings you here? Always joking, you invited my nephew and I for a home-cooked meal. Super! Of course, right, I forgot. - Was it today? - Today? You crack me up. Oh, you sly dog, top secret, eh? A pair of honeys like these. Especially the oldest, sooo well-fed. - isn't it late for her to be up? - You're right. Gladys!! Cutie, off to beddy-bye Sweet dreams with Uncle Torrente, hmm? You need rest so your tits grow big like your sister's. See you later. Look at those tears! Madam, you don't know what close friends Tinin and I were in the army at Melilla ... real bosom buddies. Agustin, you never talked to me about your old pal. You know I like keeping some things private He's so uptight. With my looks, I stole his girls. Uncle, isn't this the guy who used to swing hot both ways? What are you saying? Don't be silly. Excuse the kid, he has such a loose tongue. Your husband wasn't gay. We just pleased each other any way we could in the army. Tinin was a good doggy. Hogwash, Torrente. I have something to discuss, come with me. Of course Rin Rin. Madam, sir, excuse us. Torrente, you're mad showing up here talking trash. Who the fuck sold me out? Besides this one the boss? Copping a feel or what? Torrente, an iPhone 4, it's the latest. Can I keep it? Sure, he won't use it. Super, Torrente. Shoot me if you want, I won't say a peep, nothing, got it? Torrente, let me. Rocamora, Roman Rocamora planned it all Queers! That's the boss whose wedding I offered my services to. Services? You were the laughingstock of all Spain. Bride's still in therapy. Rocamora'll kill yaaa! Out of there, fagqots! Run, kid, come on! Run, kid, run! Let me , let me Damn, let go! Let me go. Queers! Hard-up pervs ...! I'll get you Your triglycerides! I missed them shit! Okay, so it's clear: Rocamora. What did that rat Ramirez say? Weak point is his girl. We have a photo of that babe. That's our tool of revenge. Torrente, how do you get revenge with a photo? Kid, you're so thick! We-'II blackmail him. Blackmail Can we change the music? My mother spends all clay listening to this folk stuff. Drives me up a wall. How about some hip-hop? Out of the car, kid. - What's wrong? - Nothing. There-'s nothing more sacred in the world than El Fary's music. Who? El "Fali"? Did you say El "Fali"? How is it possible that anyone doesn't know who El Fary is? Torrente, don't be like that. Please don't cry. Come on, cheer up, just a little bit. Shall we jerk off a bit? Sir, I swear I don't know what happened. I didn't know how to react. Really Mr. Rocamora, he's an imbecile. That much I know. But he's a dangerous imbecile. We shouldn't have problems, sir, he's an idiot. It would be better if he were in jail again soon. No, better if he-'s not. Since you divulged my name, I think he should disappear for good. Look Torrente, an anonymous note. I've seen these in the movies. Great, let me sign it. Something! wrong if we mail it, they'll take forever to answer. Right, the ideal thing would be to call and read it to them. - Who's got Rocamora's number? - We do. This guy's number was on Ramirez's cell. Here, call him. I have a special voice distorter. You're so smart - What's this? -I told you, sir. He surprised me Yes - Can I speak with Mr. Rocamora? - Speaking. Who is it? - Torrente. - Torrente who? Jos Luis Torrente. Listen, we have your daughter. - What? - Well, not physically. - We have photos. - What kind of photos? - Not the First Communion kind. Son of a... Quick! Trace the call! More-ti, to the pool now! How do I know you really have photos of Melanie? I never lie. Judge her cock-sucking talent yourself in an interviu pinup. You demand ...? A sworn testimony admitting you were Fontanelli's murderer, to clear my name. Or give me a million euros and I'll clear it myself from a Caribbean beach. - Torrente! - What now? Tell him to throw in another That's a lot of money. Okay, nix the 20.000 euros! Wait a sec, you spend that in toilet paper at your mansions. I hate bulk so bring only large bills in a duffel bag. Deliver it at 4 to Full Moon Mall at the Mercedes Business Park. Don't hang up No prob, it's Ramirez's phone. it's not costing me a cent. My men will make the delivery at four. What, you think I'm stupid? If you don't come personally, no God on earth will be able to save you. Understood. We got him I'll see you there Very well, good. Regards to your girl from our private parts. Hustle, move it! And don't return without his head! - Van with the "Scream Team" now! - More-ti, join 'em it's done. - Always be alert. - What is that? I shit myself, Torrente, I shit myself. Nincom-poop! More-ti, get him! Miss, we're looking for Jos Luis Torrente. Torrente, that slime. Look, let me tell you something, not another "renter" comes in here, I'm fed up to the depths of my snatch. Say what, lady? What am I saying? Out, or I call the cops! - But, madam - Madam? ma'am? mad... That's enough, lady. Tell me where Torrente is or you fly! Sons of bitches! Let me go, you bastards! Let me go! Stop, let that woman go! Torrente, they let her go. Run, kid, run. To the flat! Run, Torrente, run! Embarrassing! This government is a sham. They said they'd give first 500 immigrants at the Ministry and free residency! Long live Spain! Flattened out, crushed. Hold on, kid, the fun's about to begin. What if it's a trap? Nah, Rocamora played and lost. He knows I'm serious. He won't try anything funny, especially here. You're an ace, you're super! It'll be like taking candy from a child. Hey, hand that over. My Popsicle. A yellow Popsicle and he looks chink. Torrente, it's almost 4. - H-hour. - No, 4. You come alone? - The photos? - Here, inside. - No copies? - My word as a Legionaire. Anyway, we don't know how. Sure all the money's there? My word as a man of honor. I better count it then. Here? Surrounded by all these people? Be my guest. Torrente, I say ifs all there. We'd better go. I trust you, we're all honest here. Good. We have 'em, get the money and kill them. It's the security guy. Rocamora tricked us. Run! You said "nothing funny". They lack scruples. Go! We need kids to use as shields. Shh, nice and easy, drop the money bag or I kill this cretin Cretin, cretin, your mother's a cretin! Damn, this kid has a thing for falls! Out of the way, jerk! I should've done this long ago, Torrente. As the saying goes, you want something done, do it yourself. Or have a mate do it. Like a hand job. Rin Rin, hey kid God, what a sad creature, in the prime of life. Dim-witted, but a good kid. I'll spend all this money in your name. - it's nothing. - Hookers. - Nothing happened. - Champagne. - A 30-meter yacht. - I'm OK! - Shut up! - I'm super! -I won't forget. - Forget who? Shut up, you were supposed to be dead. Goddamit! I'm super! A tire conked me one Good, good, I'm glad. I'll give you your 2 percent. Only 2 percent? That one! - He offered you sweets? - No. Torrente, they got us. This can only be bad. - The chink. - It was him! Look who we have here. Thanks, kid, we've hunted for this guy a long time. Patrolling the city in his car aii night, non-stop He works in law enforcement, a friend you call "the cop" The dangers that he faces are those that he must stop His duty is to society, to ensure it doesn't flop He patrols the city He patrols the city in his car all night patrols the city patrols the city He patrols the city in his car all night He patrols the city Criminals and hooligans Violence and such He does the work of God with devotion and His touch He'd just as soon save a pooch, as die in the line of duty Or prevent a holdup at a bank and recover all the booty He patrols the city What do you want, you come looking for me, with all your tears and bawling you make a foo! out of me. Go and leave with the wind and take your suffering fan What do you want, let bygones be gone, I'll bear you no grudge now decide and move on. You stole my money and you stole my love.
