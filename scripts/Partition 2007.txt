As an attempt to prevent civil strife, India is divided into two nations ... Islamic Pakistan and secular India. More than 14 million people were displaced the migration of Muslims in Pakistan Sika and Hindus in India. Ancient hatreds again broke to the surface and over one million have died ... the chaos and violence that may occur as a result. Leave India to God. If this is too much, then leave her to anarchy.

Only Muslims can enter Pakistan. But if you want to dovete his wife here, we can. There are still Hindus refugees entering the country. My wife is Muslim. It will take the appropriate channels in Pakistan ... In order to obtain the papers. The current situation is still tense. If you are a Muslim, you can simply cross the border. Happy Divali, Mr. Sigh. From now on, you call Muhammad Hasan. This is not enough. But they told me in New Delhi that nothing more is needed. Wrong you are informed. We need a license ... proper identification. This is not enough. Please, let us pass. The trip was difficult for my son.

LAHORE, PAKISTAN ROYAL HOTEL, PAKISTAN Good day, sir. What can I do for you? Looking for a room with my son and me. The name and address, please ... My name is ... Muhammad Hasan. And the address? Sirsa. In Pakistan? In India. Pity. Thanks to the British, so we are many refugees became in your own home. Perhaps they had no choice. They had a choice. Naseem ... attempt to understand. We can not let you go back to India. You can not lose again. Do not do this to me. Mother, I'm begging you. Now I have a husband and her son. Do not keep me here. This man is a Sikh. And I thought that I have a problem in deciding which religion to approach. It's been a long time. Welcome to Lahore, Gian. Miss. Stillwell. Yes? You still have your bike, Margaret? Gian! What did you do? Naseem did not return. We have no news. It's been almost 3 months. Tomorrow morning I go to Castlemoon. Does anyone know that coming? No. Gian. Do you work tomorrow? No. We have no session until the next week. Can I leave you with Vijaya? You can not go alone. Here the situation is very bad. Can you lay Vijaya? This is not a smart move, Margaret. Let's go, Akber. Let's get out and be with us. Please. Please. Yes? Naseem. Gian. No! No, Akbar! No! Zakir! No! Mama! Akbar, please! She's my wife! No! Gian! No My sister with a chic! How dare you come into our home? How dare you? Murderers! You killed my father! You are attacked and massacred us as we Belial. Leave him alone! Margaret! What happens? He is a Sikh. I am a Muslim. My name is Mohammed Hasan. He is a Sikh. He tried to take her our sister. If the crime was being born as a Sikh, it is a crime to be born as a Muslim. I do not want to hear this. Half my life I was a soldier. I fought for India. For Sike, Muslims, Hindus, Christians, for all. I do not consult us, consult his people. Yes, I killed people. Lots of them. I returned home to find peace, and found the division. Hatred everywhere. I did not want to be part of it. The day I found my ... I could not leave there that someone else was found. I had to save her. But Naseem is actually saved me. Your sister is my life back. She did it again I want to live. She is my everything. My sister has a place here with its people. Why not place it would be next to me, Akbar? The whole life I was looking for. Will you give this man his sister? Never. Let's go. Do you can not send it back to Lahore, Sergeant? It is impossible. Well, maybe we manage to arrange something. I work for the government in Lahore, I suspect that a person who works for the state might want to have a new friend. Friends who can help. Take him in Lahore. Good look. How is my son? Margaret keeps it. I envy you. It must be very much like ours. Authorities will set you free if you come back with her son in India. Not without its mother. No Vijaya work, go back to India. I have some influence, even in Lahore. We will come out with this before the courts. And sooner or later we will save your wife from Pakistan. I can not go without it. It is my life. If you want to stay in life, go. Not like this is supposed to be. Your father and I were out of town. Our families were moderate views. We were supposed to be involved in such things. Your father is not supposed to die that way. There is little, but it will help you go from Pakistan. When you grow, tell his son that you are also had a mother who loved you. Mommy. So I love you so much. As usual, do not go to the main streets. Allah. Let Allah follows. Two, please, for Amritza. Tata. Dad! Do not worry. I will buy you another vreeicu. It does not matter.

Naseem! Naseem! Naseem! No, Akbar! Vijaya Go! Go! Vijaya Go! Go! Akbar, please! Naseem! Mommy! Naseem, hurry. In the train. Hurry. Enter into the train. Like many whose life is destroyed by division ... Margaret, Vijay and I have come to England. Walter took the Giam Sirs. When he and his ashes scattered Avtar around the tree in the village. His roots are deep in the earth that comes as new trees. Thus, Giana and I gave the love of power To start a new life. Lives on in everything I am, what we are.
