How about... - Her name is Elizabeth Valentine, right? - Yes. His name is on the card. - Then where the card? - Already I return to him. I want you to think for a moment. - What are the two initial letters of his name? - Who? The girl, Elizabeth Valentine. What is the name initials? E and V. (Evie) What about the doll?

I've dreamed about the painting. "Landscape in Winter Snow" with a picture of a bird trap, painting simple. If you look a little closer you will find something odd, something evil in the painting. Trap the bird. You can see the bird trapped if you're hiding behind the window. That's what keeps me thinking about the dream. The dream contains one question. Who is behind the window? Who are the people who do not want you to see, Peter? Who is behind the window? Other. Who? Evie !! You missed your station. Erika, patient. Erika? You fell asleep. What was the last station?
