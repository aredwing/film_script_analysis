'Please complete your transactions and exit through the main doors.' - What do you think? - Did you boost that? Of course not! I paid him the 12 grand. You'd risk a job like this for a necklace? - Come on, kids. - Loosen up. Over here. Hey, guys. Next floor. - One more up. - Sorry. Jeez, I'm sorry, man. Ah! Sorry. Sorry. Hey, what the hell's going on? Come on, man, what's your problem? That's what they get paid for. Let's go. Found the alarm. Don't touch anything till I say so. Damn! I said wait. - I thought you said you found it. - I didn't by-pass it yet. Idiot. Relax, we got time. Over here. - Here you go. - Right. You're gonna be a rich bride. Oh! Jesus. Oh! Frank! These'll be worth at least 25 million dollars. - Let's get out of here. - Yes, sir! Come on, come on! - Come on. - You should've been here. - Where's your cap? - Screw the cap, take this. - We said no guns. - Relax. We gotta look like real cops. Keep it. Stay cool. - You see 'em? - They saw us and ducked back inside. - How many? - I don't know. - Two. - You two hit the roof, you three inside. - Sir. - Let's go. Let's go, let's go. - Nice necklace. - Er, yeah. Our precinct won't let us wear anything but chains. That's too bad. Yeah, things are really lax at the Manchester station. Yeah... There is no Manchester station. - What the hell was that? - I don't know. Oh, no! - Officer down! - I'll meet you there! - Where are they going? - Stop! Fuck. Come on out with your hands up. Fire! Go after him. He's in a squad car. Go get him! - Let's go! - Hurry up! 'Car 129 pursuing suspect in police uniform and squad car, 'driving east on Gasray Avenue.' We're banged into a wall, we can't pursue yet. You want me to go after him when I can? No. I have a few people here who would like to meet him. Let's get in position, guys. He's coming out any second now. Here he comes! In position. Hold your ground. All right. Here goes. He's not stopping! Fire! All right, move in. - Watch him. - Easy, easy. - Where is he? What? - There's nobody in there. What the hell's going on? He rigged the fucking accelerator. Goddamnit. Motherfucker son of a bitch. - Where the fuck is he? - Start looking! - Where the fuck have you been? - Foolproof, huh? No cops, no guns. Real easy, in and out, no problem? Were you out of your mind? Setting off the alarm? - We almost got killed. - Come on. - At least you made it, lover. - Coulda been a funeral, not a wedding. - Yeah, yeah. We gotta go. - Yeah, I stopped by the... Oh, by the way, Frankie, I got some more bad news for you. - The lady's with me. - Come on, Sam, don't fuck with me. Sorry, Frank. You never were very smart. He's making you say that, right? Wrong. No! OK, blindfolds off. Hey, hey, boy. Step up. Move on up here. Come on. Move your sorry butts. Get that smile off your face. What do you think this is? Get your sorry ass on that line. Move it, fat ass! You, move! Come on up here. I don't get it. A few guards, no fences. Mm-mm. I don't know why everybody's staying around. Quiet, fuckfaces! Attention! Who does your hair, hm? Oh... What's a fetching female like you doing here? I don't know. How many guesses do I get? Well... Morning. I'm Warden Holliday. Welcome to Camp Holliday, the new jewel of maximum security institutions. All of you are now participants in a new penal experiment. Demonstration. No one has ever escaped. Why? Because we've taken the responsibility off of our shoulders and placed it on your necks. Our gift to each and every one of you. It may not make the Cartier catalogue, but it has a very real and practical purpose. Each collar is electronically linked to another prisoner's collar. If they're ever separated by more than 100 yards... We like to refer to it as wedlock. So, why not find out who your wedlock partner is and both of you run away? Because nobody knows who their partner is. The blue line around the perimeter of the compound is the point of no return. Stay within that blue line and you're always 100 yards from everyone else. Everywhere you eat, sleep and work is within that blue line. You cross it, well... I think you get the picture. So you see, ladies... gentlemen... who needs fences? Who needs guards? We got the best ball and chain in the world - your ass. Does it have to be so tight? You'll get used to it. Oh. I've seen slug wounds in my time but how come you're still breathing? Well, missed the lung, missed the spine, missed the heart. You're lucky. - I guess. - OK, you're live. Remember, don't touch it, don't even scratch it. And if you try to remove it, you and your wedlock partner... boom! Rules. No women in the men's dorms, no men in the women's dorms, men and women only meet at work, meals and magic hour. Camp Holliday is a nonsmoking prison. Anybody caught smoking and they get a day in the floaters. From this point on you cease to have a name. You will be referred to by your colour. Anybody using their real name gets a day in the floaters. OK, listen up and remember your colours cos I'm only gonna go through this once. Cardinal, Amber, Lime... Ivory. I had a pair that's... That's funny. Huh. No joke. Magenta! You, over there. Move! You, right there. You, over here. Move it in. Come on, move it in. You, go up there. You, here. Hi, I'm Teal. Hi. Frank Warren. Your name's Magenta, fuckface. I hear anything else again, it's the floaters. Fine. I'd like to bury an axe in that asshole's brain. First you gotta find it. What's that? New federal water meters. Bastards cut you off after two and a half gallons a day. Either gives you time for a shit, a shave or a very short shower. Hey, you. You. Warden wants to see you. Come on. That was one hell of a chase you gave the police. You almost got away. Too bad. Just think, I would have missed all this. Oh, it could be worse. You could be in one of those old prisons getting butt-slammed by Bubba. Lucky for me I'm in a place where they just blow your head off. Well, that's a necessary insurance policy. - I'd rather go down on Bubba. - Afraid those days are over, chum. It's a war out there now and the battlefield's up here. And I got a brand new weapon. What? Exploding necklaces? No. Paranoia. We got you guys watching each other like hawks. You're prisoners and guards at the same time. - That's sadistic. - Yeah. Lucrative, too. If I'm able to pull this thing off, I can franchise Camp Hollidays across the country like taco stands. You're not just a sadist, you're a greedy sadist. I understand how you feel. I'd be pissed off if my fiancee set me up and left me for dead. - She got cold feet. - But you got the last laugh. They thought they'd get all the diamonds but you were one step ahead. - I got work to do. - You got rid of all the diamonds first. Clever, but how did you know they were going to cross you? Do you want something or do you just love talking? - She promise you a June wedding? - You must be psychic. I can't blame you, I saw her picture. Man, those lips! - They could suck a man dry. - Oh, fuck. Bet she's banging your buddy trying to figure out where you hid the diamonds. I could kill you for a thrill. - You're not that stupid. - Don't overestimate me. You're an electronics genius, not a murderer. Where are the diamonds? If I didn't tell all the DAs in the state of California, why would I tell you? Because I'm your pal. You'd be my pal. And I'd see to it your time here goes smooth - easy details, good food, no hassles - but you fuck with me and I see to it you got 12 years of pain and humiliation. That doesn't sound so bad. Mr Magenta... everyone has their breaking point. We'll find yours. Give me a chance! - What do you want? - A chance! So what about this Emerald guy? You ever hear of a New York drug gang called the Executioners? - Yeah. - He was kicked out for being too rough. - He's chief trustee. - What's a trustee? Prisoners that help the guards. They get some favours in return. Do you mean they trust him? Look, relax or you never gonna make it. You don't know how good we got it. We're privileged to be here. Yeah, "privileged", that's the word I'd use. The food's good and the work's all right. And then there's magic hour. Oh? What's magic hour? Every night from seven to ten, you and a partner of your choice get to jump bones at the Ranch. Holliday thinks this releases prisoner tension. I've never been so relaxed. Hey. - Juicy. - Do yourself a favour, give up. ...and I said, "Fuck what?" Hi. Hi. I'm Teal. Lloyd Strathern. Ivory. Tracy Riggs. What's his problem? Don't! I heard you saw my little tracheotomy today. I got eyes everywhere and you go no eyes, no memory. You saw nothing. - Nothing, got it? - Yeah. And stay away from Ivory, she's mine. Yeah. That's fine. She's not my type anyway. Inspection! Everybody out of bed. - Move. Move! - Inspection. - Come on, come on. - All right, all right, I'm coming. Out of bed and on your feet. Up. Now! Sorry to wake you, gentlemen, but I'm looking for a very brave man. Someone here has decided to take the ultimate risk. One of you has had the guts to challenge my rules. - I thought you were smarter than this. - They're not mine. I don't smoke. Then maybe you could tell me whose they are? Well, possession is nine tenths of the law and the law round here says you go to the floaters. Emerald. Well, thanks for the cigarettes. Next time, don't forget the matches. Promise me you won't die in there, asshole. I'd hate to miss my shot. I'll do my best. He's had it. - I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. - No, you weren't. Magenta, you're gonna love this. No lights, no noises... no nothing. Couple of hours, you'll be banging on these walls, kicking and screaming to get out. By tomorrow, you'll feel like you've been in there a week. The day after, it's gonna seem like a month. There is one way out of all this, you know. Where are the diamonds? The diamonds? Gee, I know I put them somewhere... I'm sorry. You nonconformists are all alike. Emerald. Move it. How long is this ride? Oh, an hour, a week... a month. Figure it out. Hi, Frank. You remember where those diamonds are yet? You must like it in there. Hey, how you doing, man? - Hey, Teal. - How you doing, man? You all right? Get me out of here. - Get me out of here! - Shh. Here. I just wanted to say hello! Ah! Goddamn son of a bitch! - You ready to talk to Holliday? - No! I can't. Stop it! Goddamn... You still with us there, Frank? How... long? Are you having a nice day? Listen, pal, you're not looking too good. Listen to me. I could get you out of there in five seconds. All you gotta do is tell me where the diamonds are. - North... - North? North Pole. Ask for Santa. Shit. Shit! You were right. He's one tough little bastard. - 'Is he dead? ' - No, no. He's in the infirmary for a week. 'I told you he was smart. Will you listen to me now? ' OK, we'll do things your way. Everyone thought you were dead. Do me a favour, pretend I am. Jeez, Magenta, you'd make coffee nervous. Pal, I'm really sorry. Uh-uh. You are dead, fuck. Break it up. Damn it, break it up. You're making friends fast. Now, clean this up. Be seeing you. Come on, baby. I got something for you. You sure looking good, baby. Come on, don't walk away. - Oh, yeah! - Hey! Please, baby, might as well give it on up. - Uh-uh. - Oh, come on. I'll be back. Give you another chance. Hi. Come on. - What can be so important... - Shh. I know who my wedlock partner is. Gee, congratulations. Er, goodbye. And... I know who your wedlock partner is. Is that it? You're not very smart, are you? You're my wedlock partner. Bullshit. How would you know? One of the guards. I have my ways. I'm sorry, I don't feel like risking my life on information some guard told you in the middle of a poke. Listen. I've gotta get out of here and I can't do it without you. - You got a date? - A wedding to go to. Oh, great. Tracy. Let's get out of here, get these collars off. We can be together. Can I be frank with you? You couldn't turn me on if I had a switch. 'You got a real problem with women, pal.' 'Right - all the ones I know are still breathing.' - Watch yourself. - Watch your back. - Over here. - Give me that PO number. It's on the way. Don't worry about it. Thought you might want to apologise about last night. Yeah, I'm sorry I wasn't clear enough. Stay the fuck away from me. Now what? I told you she's mine. She's all yours. I didn't touch her. That's where you're all wrong, pal. Puce saw you boning at the Ranch. You don't understand, all we did was talk. Tell him. Tell him. Now I'm gonna have to kill you. Kill her. She was the one who invited me over. You guys wanna mangle each other, do it the right way - settle it in the yard. Tomorrow... morning... fuck. - Fine. - I'll see you. - You were better off in the floaters. - I was better off engaged. and nobody will make a bet on you. Teal, you've been a real pal. In case I don't make it through tomorrow, my friend's holding something for me. Give him a call and he'll take care of you. The diamonds? Come on, it's no secret, it's been all over TV. - Non of your accomplices got any of it? - No. I panicked after the job. Dropped the diamonds off, figured I could pick 'em up later. Then I got shot. That's too bad. Where can I find this friend of yours? - What's that? - It's a little equaliser for tomorrow. All these have a transmitter and a receiver. If I can attach this to Emerald's collar, it will amplify the signal and it will shatter his eardrums. - Let's try it. - No, man, it's all right. I trust you. It's only a tiny level. I need to see if it works. Ah! It works, man. It works. Hey, Teal, I didn't trigger it yet. What are you so nervous about? Let's see. OK. Damn, it's not working. Give me that. Your wedlock collar's not live. Don't be ridiculous, man. Where can I find this friend of yours? Either Holliday made a mistake... ...or you... - No. You got the wrong idea. ...are an informer! An informer! I'm not gonna get killed today. I'm... not gonna get killed today. I'm not... gonna get killed today. I'm not... I'm not gonna get killed today. No way. I'm not gonna get killed today. Well, well, well. Wouldn't want an unfair fight, would we? I am gonna get killed. Look, I, er... - When do you wanna stop it? - Just a little bit more. Oooh, I'm so scared. He's gonna strangle him. He's not gonna strangle him, he's... Get the ambulance! Get ready to fly. Jesus... Help me! - Ouch. - OK. OK, it's over. Get me some trustees over here! Get 'em back to the dormitory. Get back! You, get this man to the infirmary now! You too. OK, now. Now, back. All right, easy, watch it. Yeah... I wanna go home. Watch his head. Good. OK. What are you doing? - What does it look like? - Are you crazy? Go back! - No way. - We're gonna die. Whoo! You're my wedlock partner? Oh, no. Let's go. - I can't believe we're still alive. - You should have believed me. Last time I trusted a woman, I needed surgery. Let's get these off. Yeah, just a screwdriver and off they come. I know about electronics. Anyway, from now on, just stay close. Yeah, just don't get too close. You took the words right out of my mouth. - Oh, shit! - What? What? Why do I get the feeling you know where you're going? - Instinct. - Easy. Whoa! Look out! - So... where are we gonna go now? - Come on! Let's go. There's the ambulance. There they are. Fire. Oh... - We gotta jump. - No way. - Frank. - No! OK, but you better make up your mind quick... cos you got a nice neck! Tracy! Wait for me! Tracy? Frank! Come here. Oh... God. All right. All right, Tracy. Tracy! Come on! Hey, Tracy. Wake up! Hey! Son of a... Get off. Get off me. Well, so far so good. Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. - What? - Uh-uh. My men have reported that they crossed the river but... is he going to lead us to the diamonds? I know the guy. He was my best friend. Back in the Columbian wars, we were the boomer kings. I covered his ass while he defused the mines. Kind of relationship that builds life-long friendships. Right. Unless you're talking about 25 million dollars. And we are. Which reminds me, partners, er, I've had to renegotiate my deal. I'm going to need more than a third. I need half. Is that so? Is that supposed to be some kind of deal-breaker? - Well, you could put it that way. - Yeah? I'd rather put it this way. - Sam. - What? You're entirely too excitable. Now, listen carefully, I get one half or I detonate Ken and Barbie's collars, then nobody gets their money. - So you can do it from here? - Like a thunderbolt from God. - You're with me? - You're willing to risk $25 million? No. Are you willing to risk Hey, you guys, men and your toys! Stop it. - Half is good. - Nah. Look at me! Half is good. - I was just kidding. - Me, too. Quick. you steal the one going to Bangladesh. - It's a joke. You've heard of them? - If I hear one, I'll let you know. When we hit the coast, we'll head north. - What if I want to go south? - We still go north. I'm cold, I'm hungry, and I feel really stupid in this. Yeah, right. I'm not going any further till we get some real clothes. - We need some money. - Yeah. - Let's try it out. - OK. She's free. See if you can keep her busy. Hi, can I see some of your crystals? There's three over here that I think you'll like. I'd like to show you these. They're very special to me. They buzz me every time I walk by and I'd like you to see if this might be something that is for you. Er, so, please choose. As you know, each crystal is a mass of energy caught in a solid formation. - Oooh. - Are you feeling something from this? Ooh! OK. Er, I think that might be a very good one for you because I sense that you're strong. - Yes. - That's a terrific necklace. - OK, OK. - I'm getting a lot of energy from that. - It's a wedding present. - Oh. - How much is this one? - That is $1300. $1300? It's a life-flow experience waiting for you to happen. Honey, it's a rock. 'As the drought enters its 16th destructive year, 'the cost of water continues to skyrocket. 'LA officials project three million residents will move... ' Real good, this is great. 'In an attempt to salvage the economy... ' - Anything about us on the news? - Not yet. '... the gold standard, a desperate measure not used since the Great Depression.' 'It's time to put the dollar on the endangered species list. 'Not only has it dropped to record lows against all foreign currency, 'if we don't bedrock our dollar on a solid reserve... ' Frank, what are you doing in there? I'm, er, brushing my teeth, OK? You sure do take your time about it. 'In sports, the New York Mets have sweeped the Series in four games 'against the failing Los Angeles Dodgers.' We are adults here. We could share the bed. No, we can't. It doesn't work that way. All women are monsters, huh? Just the ones I pick. What's the matter? Did you get dumped or something? Mm-hm. So how did you end up in there, Frank? - Purse snatching? - One of life's little mysteries. Fine. You don't wanna talk, you don't wanna talk. Listen, since we're heading north I was wondering... if we'd stop at Sterling City on the way. - No. - Wait a minute. - Who died and made you boss? - I did. Go to sleep. You go to sleep. Son of a bitch. We are gonna stop. 'Police are seeking two convicts who escaped today from Camp Holliday, 'identified as Frank Warren and Tracy Riggs, pictured here. 'Authorities are combing the Jannville area 'but do not know their exact whereabouts.' Frank! Could you hurry up in there? Could you yell a little louder? They can't hear you in Cairo. Frank Warren and Tracy Riggs! This is the police. We know you're inside. - Oh, shit. - Come out with your arms raised. Shit, what are we gonna do? - Make a run for it? - That'll work(!) - You have a better idea? - Yes. Give up. Come on! Don't shoot, we're coming out! - OK, come on out. - Careful now. Nice and easy. Keep those hands up. Keep 'em up high so I can see 'em. Officer down! What the hell is going on here? Watch it! Cover me! - Oh, my God. - Call for backup! Come on! Up on the hill! Attagirl. Up here, come on. Come on! Who the hell was shooting? Gimme that. - How should I know? - 'Attention, please. 'The 9am bus to John Lennon Park will be leaving in approximately five minutes. - 'Purchase your tickets... ' - Here. - Put it on. - OK. You get in line, I'll get the tickets. 'Attention, please. 'This is the last call for the 9am bus to John Lennon Park. 'The next bus will leave in approximately 30 minutes.' 'The bus to John Lennon Park 'will leave from the curb outside the ticket office every half hour. 'Please purchase your tickets before you board.' - Hey! - Follow that bus! Now! Come on! I've never used this before, so don't be stupid. There you go. Stay within a hundred yards. - Don't stop! Run it! - I can't! Come on! Keep going! Are you crazy? Step on it! Come on! Yeah, good, good. OK, don't let anything get between you and that bus, understand? - Yeah. - Where's it going anyway? - John Lennon Park. - Oh. Never been there. What's your rush? It ain't going anywhere. - Where's the park? - Up there, you have to take a van. OK. Sorry, didn't mean to scare you. Just kidding. Yeah? Could've fooled me. Hold it! Hey! Don't go! Hey. Frank! Let me on! Sorry. 'Good morning, and welcome to John Lennon Memorial Park.' - Excuse me. - 'Before the park was dedicated, 'it contained a working zoo. 'You can see some abandoned cages to the left. 'Due to the drought in the early '90s, the lakes dried up. 'The depressed cavity to the left... ' Tracy. Tracy? Oh, no. Oh, God! You look a little pale. How are you feeling? I swear to God... if that collar doesn't kill you, I will. - Can I ask you a personal question? - What? Why were you in Camp Holliday? Oh, I didn't know you were interested. Heroin. You... You were a junkie? No, I was not a junkie. What happened? I'd like to know. Just relax, will you? Doesn't really matter. Fine. Good night. I was engaged to this guy Michael Travis. It was great but his family didn't approve of me. I didn't have the right pedigree. Who the hell were they? His dad's some big-deal Connecticut senator. Didn't like the fact that I was "only" a waitress. We were gonna elope to Vegas and then, the night before we left, two narcs broke into my apartment and found a pound of heroin. That's a lot of heroin for one person. Tell me about it. Ah, whoever put it there had enough power, political clout or whatever, to have me locked up as far away from his son as possible. Michael's getting married on Saturday and I just wanted to see him, just wanted to ask him how come he never had anything to do with me again. So why were you in there? Man, they not hangin' around here! They probably halfway to Mexico by now. Come on, Chesterton said we have to sweep the grounds. Man, let's get the hell out of here. Let's go check out the alligator pit. You'd better quit playing with me like that, I told ya. Enjoy the show? I oughta rip your collar off just to watch you blow. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. - A hundred yards and no further. - I know the rules. 'They'll be giving away five gallons of water as the grand prize... ' Yeah? Oh, hello! How are you? I was worried about you. So where is he now? Hey, hey, you're getting all hysterical over nothing. 'So it was a little gunfire, that's nothing to get upset about. 'It'll all be over soon. So has he told you where the diamonds are yet? ' No. He doesn't trust me. He doesn't trust anybody. Look, Holliday, I'm getting tired of this shit. You said all I had to do was get him out of prison, not follow him everywhere. 'Hey, relax, you're my insurance policy. 'Listen, you're going to be contacted by Sam and Noelle.' Who the hell are they? 'They shot the police officer at the motel. 'Hand the diamonds to them, they'll take your collars off, I promise.' Yeah, right. Holliday, you are a lying, cheating son of a bitch and if you think I'm... I'm... I'm fine, Dad. I'm fine. No, I can't tell you where I am but I wanted you and Mom to know I'm OK. I'll call you back when I get a chance. I gotta go. Bye. Thanks. Whoever made these did a great job. We're definitely still hot. We can explode any time. If I can get my hands on the right tools, I can defuse them. - You can do that? - I used to be in the Navy. Disarming mines was part of my job. And here I thought you were just a career criminal. Well, that wasn't really part of the plan. I wanted to set up a diving school. Then my buddy Sam introduced me to a woman who tells me how to do it. A simple job, real neat, diamonds. In and out, real easy. I said no, she said yes. She could be very persuasive. Then what? She shot me and ran off with my best friend. No way! With the diamonds? - No, the diamonds are somewhere. - Where? Safe. - Looks all clear to me. - We should check down here. Maybe they're not looking for us. And maybe Boston will win the World Series. Let's go back to the car. - Where are we going? - The roads are being watched. We'll get a boat. We'll go west, sneak up the river to Bondale. Good, we can stop at Sterling City on the way. Get the lines off. Plenty of fuel, nice fresh air, should be able to make it in under two hours. Aren't you forgetting something? What? Michael's wedding, Sterling City. - We don't have time. - It's on the way! All we wanna do is get these collars off, then you can do what you want. - We are going to stop there. - No we're not. OK. - Frank! - What? Goddamn! This is no time to be fucking around. Get in this boat! I'm staying in here till I drown or you promise we're going to Sterling City. What do you wanna see him for? You like being humiliated? Oh, that's good coming from a guy shot by his own girlfriend. Get in the boat! Please! For God's sake! OK, fine, we'll go to Sterling City. - Promise? - Promise. OK. - Bitch. - Bastard. - They're heading west. - Let me see. Hey, she's not bad-looking. - Cuter than me? - Oh, she's much cuter than you. But your teeth are sharper. Ah, yeah. - Now, you're sure you wanna do this? - Yeah. - What do you expect to get out of it? - The truth. Satisfaction. - It's a woman thing. - You'd still marry him? Maybe. With the right guy, marriage can be a great institution. I just got out of an institution. - That's his sister Melanie. - It's all right, I'll sign us in. Melanie! - Do I know you? - Yeah! Michael and I used to steal software together. Excuse me. Jesus! Tracy! I know this seems like a bad time but where the hell have you been? - What is this about? - Deborah, I have no idea... Deborah? I didn't know frigid debutantes were your type! - You're going right back... - Let go! How come I never heard from you? - Why didn't you call or write me? - Let her go, Dad. - You owe it to me! Tell me! - I didn't know where you were. - They had me sent to prison, you jerk. - Prison? - You didn't say anything about prison. - She's hysterical. Shut up, Dad! Tracy... You knew about this? - You gotta believe me... - Michael... - I loved you. - Tracy, it wasn't me, it was Dad. He said he'd give you some money and you'd go away. You son of a bitch. Get her out of here! Yes, sir. Excuse me. Come on, let's go. Oh, no, my God. Excuse me! Let's take the express. Tracy! Frank! - Wait! - I gotta go with her! - Tracy! - Don't go! Don't go! We're gonna die! Now what? - Wait! - I'm sorry! - No! - Come on! I'm wedlocked to that guy, and if we're separated I'm gonna blow up. - Marriage'll do that to you. - Goddamnit, call the police! I'm an escaped prisoner from Camp Holliday. - Isn't that that singles resort? - This isn't a joke! Randy, can you check on something for me? - Wait a minute. Is that him? - Yeah. Let's go. Hey! Wait a minute! Hey! What are you doing? Nooo! I'm gonna blow up any second, you dickheads! 'The cops are looking for your girl, she's got a bomb.' - She's got a bomb! - She's gonna blow! Get down! Get down! Frank? Frank? Stay down, stay down. Frank? Spread out, everybody, get down! Tracy! Jesus Christ! Come on. Hey! Hey, man! Wait, I have an idea. Stay right here. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna get us to Bondale. No. No. Fuck you. Come on. Is it my eyesight or am I getting paranoid? Oh, my God. This Noelle sounds like a real princess. - She actually shot you three times? - She only had three bullets. Says she ran off with your buddy Sam. What a slime. How do you get even with a guy who steals your woman? Let him keep her. Buddha's Bed & Breakfast? This should be interesting. Listen, we've been riding in the back of a truck all night. I didn't exactly get a whole lot of sleep. Don't ask. If I told you, you would never believe me. Just don't forget the tools, OK? We'll be there. Bye. - What a guy. - Who? Jasper, he's a buddy of mine. Oh, God, a real bed. How do you feel? Better than I look. You look fine. What? Nothing. Just tired. So what now? I don't know. We might maybe... - start again. - I meant... what is our next move? Oh. Well, we're... we're gonna go to the brewery where Jasper works and he is gonna pick us up at 12. Does he have the diamonds? Yes. But I told him it's Sunday morning and we need some time to get a little sleep. Mmm, good idea. Frank? What? Oh, sorry. - I'll switch it off. - Jesus. I'm thirsty, I'm gonna get some water. You want anything? No. Thank you. - You having second thoughts, Tracy? - What? Relax. Didn't Holliday tell you to expect us? You? You were his fiancee. Oh, you make it sound so romantic. Did he tell you where the diamonds are? No. No? What do you mean, no? Now, look, all we want is the diamonds. You understand? Listen, sweetheart, it's just like Holliday said - as soon as we get the diamonds, we'll take both your collars off and everything is going to be fine. You want those collars off, don't you? - You listen, sweetheart... - Easy. I don't know where the diamonds are. He hasn't told me yet. So you'll keep your eyes open. And we'll be in touch. Get out of here. That fucking bitch is getting out of line. You all right? - Come on, I want a hug. - Ohhh. - It's almost over. - Yeah. Something bothering you? No, nothing. Frank, there's something I have to tell you. Tracy, hold on to that. If you feel the same way as I do, let's wait until this is over and then maybe do something about it. We have time. OK? Jasper. Hey! Look at this! You look great! Look at ya! So, man, I thought I'd never see you again. - I can't believe you left LA. - Man, you know I hated LA. Fucking brown air, brown trees, brown oceans. The only green thing they got is fucking traffic lights. Besides, I couldn't afford the water. Why didn't you cash in on the loot? It's gonna take a lot more than 25 million before I'd screw you. Seems to me half is fair. Twelve million? Jeez, I could open my own brewery. Incorporate, go legitimate, pay taxes. Nah! - You all right? - Yeah, fine. Come on, I'll show you how they make suds. This carries grains and malts down into that thing over there. And that thing, well, that baby, well, she blends and, you know, all that kind of shit. Yeah? Sounds very scientific. I'm just a grain shoveller. Who gives a shit how they make it? Just as long as you get buzzed. You know what I mean? Like, really. You don't ask the buzz how he got there. Just be glad he knocks. Everything you wanted. I never heard of some of this stuff. Thanks, pal. I owe you one. Oh, no! - Jesus Christ! - No. But I am flattered by the comparison. Now, back up. - You didn't have to kill him. - Sometimes you don't think, just do it. Oh. Like killing your best friend? We thought about that. Hi, lover. Oh, Noelle, darling. I'm so glad to see you, I never really got a chance to say fuck you. Such an ingrate. We saved your life at that bungalow. We've been your guardian angels. Oh, of course, it's so simple. You guys let me escape, I lead you to the diamonds. The whole thing is a setup? Brilliant. So how did you follow us? Uh-huh. Oh, no. Nice job, sweetheart. You getting bad flashbacks, Frankie? I mean, talk about your cosmic screws. - Frank, I tried to tell you. - Oh, shut up. You got what you wanted. Will you let us go? Sorry, sweetheart, this one's personal. Don't you wanna make sure you have the diamonds? You're gonna feel pretty stupid when you find out they're not in it. I got a question for you, Frankie. - Please. - How does it feel to die twice? - I got the bag! Tracy, come on! - Son of a bitch! Where'd they go? There! They've got the bag! - Can we make it? - Sure, no problem. - Sam! Here they are! - Where? - By the vat! - There's fucking vats everywhere! The big one! Tracy! Hold on! The bag! All right. Damn it. - You son of a... - Frank, I'm sorry. Help me, Frank. I'm sorry, man. Come on, Frank. - What are you gonna do now? - Please, Frank, I'm sorry. Son of a bitch. Frank, help me out, man. Ha! Nowhere to run now, lover! I'm sorry, sweetheart! If you want me, you'll have to shoot my buddy. - Sam! - Noelle! Don't shoot. This didn't work out very well, did it, Frank? Why did you do it, anyway? The money or Noelle? Oh, man. She's awfully cute, isn't she? You hit me, you bitch! Sorry, honey, but I did it for the money! - Looks like she fucked us both, hm? - Yeah. Hey, you want her back? Come on. You're losing a lot of blood. We gotta stop and take care of this. What is this place? Abandoned nuclear power plant? What do you think? - I think I'm gonna faint. - Hang in there, Frank. Oh! God. - How's that? - That's fine. - You gonna be OK? - Yeah. Hey, you weren't kidding. Where are the diamonds? Jasper fenced the diamonds for cash. The money is... somewhere. What's all this stuff? God. They're tools from the aerospace lab. I can't fucking do this. I can't fucking do this. Wait a minute. Maybe you can. - Frank. No, no way. - You do it. Come here. Get down here. We don't have a choice. Here, take this. Take off the lid. Where? Now, take out the plastic explosive. - This? - Yes. But you gotta be very gentle. Don't unplug it or it will blow up. I can't believe I trusted you. Look, it was either go along with Holliday or spend the next 30 years of my life in hell. What would you have done? - I still think you should've told me. - Frank, what would you have done? - I would've told you! - Bullshit. I would have. Maybe. Exactly. Now, will you shut up? Let's just forget about it. Take this. Don't... touch the pins. - Clip it on the box. - That one? Yeah. OK. - It's on. Now what? - The thing with the wires. Get the blue wire and attach it on the top, second one, your right. - Here? - Yeah. The red one goes on the bottom, far left. - Here? - Yeah. Good. No, it's OK, it's OK. It's a temporary safe mode. What we're gonna do is disconnect the explosive. OK. Gently. - Ah... - Follow the double wire. Get a good grip. Don't touch the magnet. OK. OK. Oh! Oh, we did it! - Oh. - It's OK. Oh, thank God that's over. It's your turn now. You gotta do yourself. You can do it. OK. Eleven paces from the door. Right. Careful. Got it. Yeah! Whoa. Yeah, whoa! Great! - That's it, Frank. - Oh, great. Let's see. Oh! I think this is for you. Shit. Son of a bitch. Mr Magenta! Miss Ivory! No hellos for an old friend? How did you find us? Oh, stupid, stupid, stupid. Play with the dummies, you gotta think like one. - You had all the cards. - Of course. I don't like surprises. You're playing in the big leagues now, pal. Do or die, a lot of money on the line. Now, if you please, hand me those briefcases slowly. - You'd better check it. - You check them. Ahh. Smart for a change! Fencing the ice. Thank you for saving us the trouble. Oh, it was nothing. I'd say that looks like about 12.5 million each. - Take your pick. - Hmmm... Close it up. Please. I'd love to stay and chat but, er... You coming? Nah, just go ahead. I'll drive the truck down to Mexico, after I settle a little score. Er, well, here. Save your bullets. - What's that? - A detonator. They could've blown us up any time. I'm curious. Were you ever in love with me or was it always a setup? Oh, you were so handsome and you were a very decent fuck but you fall in love way too easily. I'm trying to remember what I loved about you. It was my ass. Oh, you had so many bad breaks, Frank. I guess life isn't for everyone. You're gonna need the keys. You never were very smart, lover, were you? Holy moly. I never was very smart but then... I'm not the one who blew up, lover. Sorry. What do you think? Should we stay together... now we don't have to? Till death do us part? That sort of thing? I don't know, Frank. You're no day at the beach. You're no picnic either.
