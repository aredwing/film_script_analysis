I'm so stupid. What lured you out here? They said that we should dump Julia Christiansen. We had to bathe naked, and so we had to dump her. Dumpty Julia Christiansen? Is not she quite popular? I thought they liked me. Set we are gone, when they come back? Set we swim ashore, getting clothes and show up for breakfast? I will never see them more! I will not talk about it anymore, so shut up. I'll burn to a fire. We have to keep us warm. They're coming back! - They're coming back! - Why is that? They will probably shoot us and force us to eat sand. We go down to the water. When they go up here, we take a canoe. - Are you coming? - I do not know. - I go. - Wait! I'm coming with. - Why do not we turn off the lights? - If it burns, do they think we are here.

Did you? They were still hot. I could not do it. Hers was the clean. You said they smelled good. What are you laughing at? Pull your pants up, however. Come on!

It's not that hard. Should anyone run with the other bus? It's probably two of us. Yeah, but come on! It is you who slows us down. It is several hours ago, I spoke to her. Where is she? - She can be bolted. - Stung by? Mr. Russell, she is 12 years old. She was Their responsibilities. That you understand it? Of course. I'm just so worried for your daughter who you are. She said, that she would go back to camp? No, not in the words. I said I would come to visit the weekend on Saturday. I understand. She's not coming before on Saturday? Are you saying that this is my fault? - They do not panic. - I am in a panic! She came here to have fun and make new friends. We develop the children's social characteristics - - But a strong, young woman created at home, not at a camp. - Tell me what happened. - Not all children thrive in the beginning. The others mistakenly thought they could improve your daughter - - By placing her in a situation where she understood - - That we're just people. "Improve" my daughter? What the hell are you talking about? - They left her on an island. - Leaving behind the her? They thought enough not evil with it. We are accustomed to jokes about redheads, but this ... - It is criminal. - I put even a stop to it. But some traditions die hard. I was a goat. - What? - At camp. The island is called Gedeen. I was left, and ... And ... I was a goat. At first I was afraid, but everything went fine. There, you see. We must find her, you understand that? It should be right now. Sheriff and police and other authorities cooperate - - To find your daughter. I understand how it feels. No, you do not. I would have been in the space camp. Why did you do it? Mother would not let me go to Houston alone. We need to NASA together later. - Want to be an astronaut? - I think so. I want to fly so high that I can monitors the ground with his thumb. Silly, is not it? No, not at all. The boys go to the right. Follow Vince. Girls left. Follow ms. Higgins. - We can not be separated from each other. - We run away. Here you go. Always leave, like you know, what you're doing. - Take all of your belongings. - Over here. What are you doing? Why are you out in the woods? Take it easy! - We should tell mr. Carlson it. - No, do not. - Where are you going? - To our camp. - Where is it? - Near. It will be dark soon. There are wolves and bears in the woods. - She is scared. - We are not afraid. They may well sleep here tonight? No one knows anything. They even our camp shirts. It's okay. But Susie Burns'd be mad. - We must stay together. - It can not. - Boys and girls sleeping separately. - We should go back. Who are they? - Do not you know? - I have not seen them before.

It is Susie Burns. - In whose bed she should sleep? - I min. - We will have trouble. - No, Susie, for you know nothing. Well? It's only in the night, Susie. You must choose bed first. Okay.

It is already dark, and we do not know where we are. - Tomorrow we stabs of. - Yes. Sit down. We have a couple of points and then you can start to have fun! No, I sent her away to work in peace. What? We agreed, that this was good for her. Yes, it's a great cause. So what? That's why we drive Houston afterwards - - So she can visit NASA. David, you are her father, and you know not that she likes space. She keeps more of the other planets than of it here, and I understand her well. No, I do not know why she did not called you and your new wife. I'll call when I found her. - Come on, let's dance! - I dance badly. Come on, Clyde! Hi, Bonnie. You and me, okay? Let me be your. Now we dance. - I do not know ... - Come on. I will not bite. Come here. Relax. It's just a kiss. Here comes the Clyde. I just said, that Bonnie needs a real man. - She did. - There is only one real man here. And I need a mirror to see him. - Bonnie, that fool to go. - Shut up! Clyde, shut your trap, before I shut it for real. I'm not talking about you, I talk to Bonnie. You are a zero, Clyde. A genuine zero. No! So we stop! What is happening? - Butch fell, sir. - What happened there, Butch? I fell. I have injured knee. We just silly around. The party is over. Go back to the lodge. How are you? Clyde is just cool! So his look? The clean bedroom eyes. As Richard Gere in officer-film where he carries his lady. - I'm not his lady. - Stop it! We're just friends. If you are just friends You may greet him from me. So off vilyset / i What happened to your arm? My father drank a lot. When I made a noise or did anything wrong, he burned me. - With what? - With a cigarette. - I do not understand why you do it. - Do what? Do not hurt them. You get them myself worse afterwards. - That's it, that's the problem. - What do you mean? Some people like it. They feel stronger that way. As your father? Yes, I suppose so. Do you wish that you had no father? Sometimes. Sometimes I wish I had an older brother. A protector. Yes, a brother would be awesome. Promise me that you call your mother, as soon as you come into town. Ask her to pick you up right away. Say anything, she just comes. You can not hide like this. Okay.

I have not actually so many friends back home. I lied. It does nothing. Would you have helped Julia, if they had chosen her? I do not know. Did you know to Bryce puts the girls in the class? Super Sweet, sweet, normal, ugly and super ugly. What was I? He said that you were ugly. But he did not look right on you. He would never have said it, if he had looked at you. I feel disgusting. I'm in the shower. You were right. This is very Better than sleeping in the woods. Yes, that's it. - I like your glasses. - I hate them. I remember when I got them. Suddenly I could read the signs. In the bus I read them aloud. Everyone thought I was crazy. I did too. Everything was so clear. - You know what? - What? I should have asked sooner, but I did not get done.

Where is she? Deputy Sheriff frightened them so they jumped into the lake and swam ashore. - Grace can not swim. - Howie and Grace? Sheriff review it, the deputy acted inappropriately. He wore no uniform, and he appeared not quite correct. What did he do? We were supposed to meet here. Go back to hotel and wait for the Grace calling. - I'll call if she comes. - Everything will go fine. I need to talk to mr. Russell, I'll come back. I'm sorry it has happened with Grace. She's really sweet. Not like some other roots here. Thank you. - Was your mother there? - No. Mother is in a hotel in Ahlburg. It said her secretary. She came here yesterday. Mr. Russell rang when we came back. She drove directly to the individual. She is very concerned and the police looking for us. Mother gets angry with me. I thought not that mr. Russell would call.

We could have all what we needed ... ... from meadows and cottages. No one would bother us anymore. Jag has thought a lot about it recent days. I would tell it, but you had probably thought I was crazy. Yes, it's crazy. But it's a nice thought. We would have to to build a raft. If you could not teach me how to swim. - You could teach me, right? - I think so. What if one of us got sick? I do not know. I thought not. You would have found something.
