You're gonna get in the water today, Case? Oh, I'm gonna get in the water. Today? Today! I'm gonna get up on that board today. You're telling me you're gonna get in the water after all this time? It's been since junior high you haven't done it yet. You're right, I haven't done it yet, but I'm gonna do it today. What's so special about today then? You wanna know what's special about today? I had my Crunch-berries this morning, so I'm feelin' good. Waves were awesome this morning, bro. Dude, you are insane. What do I have to do to get you in the water? Uh, drain the ocean. Right, right. I'm serious. I can't believe we're almost done with school. Done? Uh, hello, we still have like another four more years to go. What, college? College. Dude, I don't even want to think about college.

Well, you've been promising to teach me since like... junior high. Case, you gotta get out into the water first, man. Dude, there's sharks out there and stuff. Okay, you know, stuff that could like, kill you. Right, like, let's say we're swimming along like, somewhere exotic, like in the Caribbeans, and then I cut my leg on a coral reef. Sharks have a very strong sense of smell, and then the next thing you know, one of them comes up, rips my leg off. Case, I think you've watched Jaws one too many times, man.

You've got six minutes to get Mrs. Winterbottom her large jalepeno and meatball or it's coming out of your salary! Hey Mom. Where's Dad? You're late, Luke. I asked you to be on time tonight, honey. Well, where's Dad? He's later than I am. This isn't about your father, this is about you showing a little respect. Alright, take it easy, I'm sorry. Sorry about what? Nothin'. I'm starved. Well, now that we're all here, we can say grace first? Sure. Dear Lord, thank you for this food. Thank you for the time that we can spend together as a family. And please, Bless the time that we have together this evening. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Oh, amen. Well, I hope it's not cold it was hot at seven when everybody was supposed to be here. How's work? Work's work. So, any word on colleges yet? Yeah, deadlines are comin' up, Luke. What if I didn't want to go to college? What? You hear this kid? Did I miss the memo that you had a choice in the matter? Look, what if I just want to surf for a living? I'm sorry, is somebody paying you to surf? Yeah, exactly. So surf on your own time, because your mother and I have been sacrificing for years so that you can get a good education. Thanks. Look Luke, we've been putting up with this surfing thing for years. I mean, you've turned my garage into a surf shop. It's time you grow up. You're gonna go to college, and that's it. I just, uh... love these family dinners. And you know what? You don't have to eat anything. Why don't you just go up to your room then. Fine, I will. David! What? You know, and I appreciate the support, Dad. Yeah, but how about the roof over your head? And the food on the table, pal? Really? You're unbelievable. Where are you going? Surveillance all night. Don't wait up. Perfect. This is just perfect. Encinitas. Hey, what're are you doing here? You're usually the last one in, first one out. Yeah, well... not in a huge hurry to get home. Uh-oh, girlfriend or parents? Parents... they're trying to plan my life for me. You gotta have a plan, Luke. Life can get pretty messy without a plan. Yeah, but I mean, their plan or mine? Well, you have to honor your parents, that's a command of God, But you also have to maximize the gift that God's given you. They want me to go to college and... I just want to surf. You gotta get you education. That's just a fact of life. Especially when you've got parents that are willing to pay for it. Your parents make you go to college? Did they make me go? Don't I wish. No, I did everything the hard way. Twenty years in the army, taking classes on the side, saving every penny I could. But see, that was my plan. And here I am. Gonna be opening a second location soon, too. That's great, Carl. Look, all you have to do is come up with a plan that will please you, your parents, but most importantly God. Is that all? That's all. Ha ha ha. Look, why don't you talk to your folks. You might be surprised how receptive they can be when they see that you're taking some action. Do you do much night surfing? Night surfing? It's kinda hard to see the waves, Carl. Well, you can always take night classes. Same credit, same degree. Now, get on outta here, I gotta lock up. Thanks. Thanks, Carl. Lou's Records. Oh, I was hangin' with Nat down at the shop today, he was telling me how there was an opening on the surf team and how tryouts were coming up... I mean, I'm sure you heard about it. Yeah. Yeah, I heard about it. Well, you're gonna tryout, right? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know, man? I mean, think about it this is your shot. You make the team, and you're on your way. Maybe. Maybe... Well, I took the liberty of signing us both up. You did what? I had to, man. What do you mean you had to, Case? Well that new guy from school was in the shop today and he was talking to Nat. He was all like, "Oh, that spot is so mine." And I was like, Psh, that's funny coming from "a guy who doesn't know how to pop up." So I signed us up. I'm just looking out for you, bro. Besides, that spot, all you. Yeah, yeah. Ah, here we go, jackpot. Nice. See, I told you Lou's Records would have it. You see this price? Pretty nice. What's this? So, I have a plan. There's tryouts coming up for the local surf team. I'm signed up, and I think I really have a shot. Luke, we've talked about this surfing thing. Honey, your son has a plan, I think we should let him finish. Okay, so here's the deal. If I make the surf team, I get to keep surfing full time. But I promise I will go to night classes at the community college. And if you don't make it? I mean if, if I don't make it, then I mean... you can pick any college you want me to go to even if it's a thousand miles away from the nearest beach. But I'm still gonna get my education either way. So... you really can't lose. I mean, what good is making this surf team? Are they gonna pay your rent? It's just a step, Dad. Well, I think it's a great plan, Lucas. I do, and I'm really proud of you for coming to talk to us about it. Dad? Win or lose, no more surf shop. I want my garage back. Deal, deal. Okay? Okay. We're gonna go with you on this one, alright? It's up to you now. Thanks, Dad. Mom. I really have no life right now. I can't even... Hello. Hi, uh, can I help you? Yeah, we have a pizza for pick-up. Wait, aren't you in my history class? Yeah, yeah. You sit in the front, right? Yeah, ye ah, that's me. I'm Emily, by the way. Luke. The pizza? And this is Jessica. Yeah, um, what's the last name? Lopez. Right. That was so obvious. He's so cute. Large pepperoni, extra cheese, right? Yeah, that's it. Hello, the total? Oh, uh... $14.50. Thanks. Here you go. Thanks. Thank you. Are you guys going to Kelsey's party tonight? We, um, heard about it. Are you going? Yeah, I mean I'll be there. Cool. Well, it was nice to finally meet you, Luke. Likewise. Oh, you too Jess... Jessica. Yeah. Bye. That part of the plan, Luke? We'll see, Carl. Bro. This party is sick. There's babes... everywhere I turn. Yeah, man, well... why don't you go introduce yourself? That's the problem, man. Everywhere I turn, they turn me down. Case, I'm sure there's somebody out there for you, man. Dude, no way. Yo, I'll be back. What? Oh, come on, you're not gonna... You're gonna crash and bum, bro. He looks drunk. I know. Oh, hey girls. Hey, what's up? Having fun? - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, oh, can I get you a beer or something? No, um, actually we're good. So is this what you call a birthday party? Yeah. Yeah, I mean... there's someone with a hat on over there. I can't remember who, but yeah. So, um, is this what you usually do for fun? No, I... usually I'm in the water. Oh, are you on the swim team? No, the swim team? No. no. Usually I'm surfing. Oh, you surf, that's, that's so cool I've, I've always wanted to surf, actually. No way, really? Yeah. I could totally teach you sometime. I, I go before school. Yes, that would be amazing. Okay, surfer girl? We have that other get-together to go to, and we're late. Sorry. Um, yeah, we, I have to go. But it was really good to see you. I'll talk to you later. Likewise. Okay, bye. Alright. And don't drink too much. No, I won't, I won't. Hey, great convo. Convo. Smooth, Luke. Told ya, bro. Crash and burn. You just never listen. Hey, you can't even see with those glasses on. Smooth moves. Case, you hear something? You know, I didn't hear anything, man. Don't waste your time on that chick, dude. She's some kind of Jesus freak. She'll just try to convert you. Yeah, I'll take my chances. Thanks. I'm Matt, by the way. Yeah, I'm Luke. This is Case. Yeah, we met the other day at the surf shop. He was bragging all about you. Saying you're the only one in my way of that spot on the team. Thanks, Case. Just telling it like it is, my man. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Alright, well, I'm telling you guys like it is. That spot is mine. You come over here and introduce yourself, and then you start acting like a kook! Kook! I can out-surf you any day of the week. In your dreams. Yeah? I'll, I'll take you on right now! I don't know if you've noticed... but it's dark. And I'm kinda drunk. Okay. Okay. Excuses. Tomorrow then, at The Point. What time? 8:30. Okay. Better show up. Oh, I'll be there. You can believe that guy? Listen, that spot? All yours. That's what I'm talkin' about, man. That's what I'm talkin' about. Come here. Bring it up, come here. I love you, Lukester. Dude, you're my boy. You're my boy. I want some taquitos. Dude, let's do it. 7-11, I'm hungry. One too many there, buddy boy? What are you talking about? How do you think this reects on me? Dad, you need to chill. Chill? I'm a police officer, Luke. And my teenage son's Out There running around drinking and getting drunk? Should have never let you stay home from church. Church? The only reason you go to church, Dad, is because Mom makes you. You're about as much Christian as I am. We're through here. You're grounded until you learn some respect for me, your mother, and yourself. You can't ground me! I just did! My house, my rules. I have to be at the beach in the morning. Not tomorrow, you don't. You're gonna stay in your room until you change your attitude, Luke. What happened to this plan of yours? You know what? Why don't you go to your room before I decide to take something else away from you? And don't wake your mom up when you go upstairs. Crazy kid! Hey, thought you'd never show. Guess you thought wrong. Are you ready for an old-fashioned butt-whooppin? Yeah, we'll see. Let's do it. Where you two been? I'll tell you where we've been. Your son deliberately disobeyed me and went surfing this morning, knowing full well he wasn't supposed to leave his room. You know, it's safe to say you're going to be on restriction for the rest of your natural-born life, pal. So, up to your room. Was that necessary? Your son came home stinking drunk last night. So I put him on restriction. That means in his room, and that means no surfing! Have you ever watched him surf, David? I mean, really watched him? God has given him a gift. I don't care if God gave him a surfboard from the burning bush. He disobeyed me! Oh, whatever. You know what? If I don't start getting some respect from you or him, then maybe we should start thinking about another plan. Why... what is that supposed to mean? Luke's getting older, he's almost done with school. Maybe we need to be done, too. Where is this coming from? You cannot be serious. I gotta go. Where are you gonna go? It's Saturday! What are you talking about? Somebody's gotta make money around here! I'm getting sick of your real estate deal. Fine, you know what, just go! Yo, dude. Hey. Sorry about your dad showing up. Yeah, whatever. I had you anyways. Right. One spot. On that team. It's all mine. Dude, keep dreaming. Later. What's up dude? What's goin' on, man? I just seen you conversing with the enemy. What, are you kidding me? That guy? Yeah right, man. He can surf though. I'll give him that. So we hanging out after school? Are you kidding me, man? I think I'm on restriction for the rest of my life. I'm sorry, bro, I'm sorry. It's not worth it, man. Well, you wanna get out of here? Yeah, man, let's do it. I hope so, I hope so. I feel like I'm getting through to some of them, so... Is that son of yours ever on time? Would you like some more coffee? I'm fine, thank you. Hey Mom. Oh, here he is. Dad, you're home early. Don't get wise, Luke. Sweetie, I'd like you to meet somebody. This is Pastor Shane. He's the new high school leader at church. What's this all about? What's up Luke, I'm Shane. Hey. I just... I thought it would be really good for you two to meet. Why? Watch it. You know, I was just telling your parents about some cool things that are happening down at church, think you might like. Cool things in church. Right. Luke! Sorry. Pastor Shane, church really isn't my thing. Sorry. Luke. Luke! I am so sorry about that. No worries. Comes with the job it's okay. He'll be at church, Pastor, even if I have to drag him there myself. Hey, you. Oh, uh, hey. Uh, sorry we left the party the other night. It's not really my thing. It was kind of a lame party, anyways. And I got way too drunk. Yeah, I kinda noticed that. You know, you should really be careful. Careful, right. Oh, I heard you go to Beach-side. Yeah, I do. Do you go there? Uh, I guess I do now. Cool. My parents are making me go to youth group, too. Punishment for the other night, so... Well, um... maybe it'll do you some good. You know, some of us actually enjoy going to church. Right. Sorry. Um, well, maybe I'll see you there. Yeah, yeah, maybe. Well, um, uh, I... I have to get going before my dad sends a patrol car after me, so... Yeah, I actually gotta go too, so... Maybe I'll see you around? If you're lucky. Don't ruin your appetite. Hey Mom? I was just wondering... are you and Dad happy? What brought this up? I heard you guys talking the other day. Didn't sound too good. Honey, your father's under a lot of pressure at work. Don't worry, everything's fine. This is all my fault isn't it? No, this... why are you saying that? No. Your father and I love you more than anything in this world. Okay? Okay. What does the world "integrity" mean to you guys? Abby. Isn't it like being totally honest. Even when no one else is watching? Exactly. It's the decisions we make when we're alone. It's that little voice inside that says, "I'm not gonna do this... even though I probably won't get caught." Or "I am gonna do this", because it is the right thing to do... "even though it's not always the coolest thing to do." Can anyone give me an example? Yeah, Danny? What about when you're surfing the Web, and maybe you're tempted to go to a site that you know you're not supposed to be on? And you don't go there? Good. And how would you know? Hey guys, cool it. We've all been there. Anyone else? Jessica. It's honoring your parents. Exactly, exactly. What about you, Luke? What does "integrity" mean to you? Uh, yeah, they're both right. You think I'm gonna let you off that easy? Come on, man. Example from your life anything at all. What do you mean? Okay, why are you here? Well, the only reason I'm here is because I made a promise to my Mom. You, re here, aren't you? Keeping that promise? That's integrity. Keeping your commitments... to God and to others. Did you get Luke off to youth group on time? Do you see him? Of course I got him there on time. Pastor Shane's gonna give him a ride home. Pastor Shane? Yeah. Why, why aren't you picking him up? Because I have to work. You have to work of course you do. Why did I even ask? Probably have to work during our counseling session, too. See... why do you assume that? If I say I'm gonna be there, I'm gonna be there. 'Cause I only want you there, David, if you want to be there I wouldn't be going unless I wanted to be there. Well, thank you. Volvo's in the shop, huh? YUP. Wouldn't be stuck here if it wasn't. Grab those Bibles for me? How's the surf been lately? Um... been at as a lake the last few days. Bummer, man. Mom tells me you want to surf for a living. Yeah. Yeah, I guess. That's great. How long you been surfing? I don't know, since I was little. Luke Harris... Pro Surfer. Could work. Could work? Now what's that supposed to mean? Pretty big commitment making that level. Even harder staying there. Oh, and you know... you know all about that. Look, man. You ever want to talk, my office is always open. Is that cool? Yeah, yeah that's cool. Well, let's get you out of here. You know, we got a group of guys that go surfing here all the time. You should come join us. Yeah. I mean, you know, maybe. Oh, hey Mom. Hey Honey. How was work? You show any houses today? I finally got a real offer on that Johnson's old house. That's great. Praise the Lord. How was school? Same old. Oh, hey, haw was church last night? Oh, it was great. Pastor Shane's really cool. You don't sound too enthused. Eitherway, I am just so proud of you for going. Life isn't always about doing what we feel like, Kind of like you staying married to Dad, Lucas, listen. We have to keep our promises, no matter how we feel about them... and whether it's a relationship, or promising to be somewhere every week, like your youth group. Sorry. Your father and I are going to start counseling at church this week. This is just a season in our lives, honey. God's gonna see us through this. Cool. I'm so glad that you guys are here today. Well, David, the fact that you're here is really big. In a lot of situations like this, when we do marital counseling, a lot of times the husband doesn't even show up. And it's really awesome that you're here. Well, she thought it would do us some good, so. That's your answer? What? Never mind. Here we go. See, Pastor, this is part of the problem. I work really hard for my family, putting my life on the line every day that I put my badge and my gun on. And then I come to my own home and I get no respect. She even says grace before we eat. Well, somebody has to. Well, maybe I would if you gave me half a chance. But obviously the fact that you're both here shows that you want some change to happen in your relationship and to strengthen your family. Is that correct? Good. Well, the Bible's full of specific things? That you can build your life upon, and it'll lay a rock-solid foundation. But if you don't apply it and you don't use it, it doesn't work. In the book of Joshua, we hear one of the most significant quotes in the entire Bible. In its word, Joshua is addressing all the children of the Israel and he tells 'em, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." And David, I want to encourage you today. What are you gonna do? Who are you gonna serve? You've gotta make a choice. It's not based on your comfort. It's not based on convenience. But it's gotta be based on a commitment that you make before God and your wife. So as you leave here today, think about it. Who are you gonna serve? How many more chips you got... Hey. Oh, hey. Oh, have you met Casey? No. Um, hi, Casey. I'm Emily. Hey. It's nice to meet you. How's it going? So, um, the youth group is going to Boomers this Saturday. You should totally come. To Boomers? Oh, wow. I mean, I haven't been to Boomers since I was little. Right, I get it. It's not cool enough for you. Oh, no, no, no. Not at all. Ah actually, it sounds like a lot of fun. Cool. And, Casey, you can totally come too. It'd be really fun. It sounds, sounds good. Great, so I guess I'll see you later? Totally. Alright bye. Are you serious? My mouth was full, bro! I couldn't get a word out. Okay? Seriously man, like, video arcades are an the comeback. You just mark my words. Fine. But if you want to go to Boomers, then you have to go to youth group with me. Youth group? Still up? Yep. Just finishing up some homework. Well, your father and I talked. And we think it's about time you're off restriction. Thanks, Mom. You think you can stay out of trouble this time? Yeah. I won't let you down. Alright. Why don't you finish up and get yourself some sleep, okay? Okay. Love you. Goodnight. By a show of hands, How many have ever done something they may regret? All right. How many wish you could undo what you did? I forgot lunch. I'm sorry, guys. You guys don't mind? Anyone hungry? Casey, right? Yeah. All right, let's see. Here you go. Anyone else? Uh, I think my banana's defective. Looks whole on the outside, doesn't it? But on the inside it's cut to pieces. This banana is like our lives without Christ. But God, God is always there to pick up the pieces, no matter how bad we mess up. Hey guys. A bunch of us are going to go for pizza. Do you want to come with? Yeah, totally. Yeah, um, but Casey just got his license today, so I'll ride with him. No way! Yep, about time. Bout time, I know. Well, that's perfect I guess we'll just go in Jessica's car and we'll meet you there. Yeah, that sounds great. - Okay. - I'll see you there. - Bye. - It was fun. Yeah. Dude, Emily, she really likes you, bro. Oh, you think? Oh, I know, man. Don't mess this up, Lukester. She could be the one. Ya know, she is pretty cool. Dude, can you believe we're hanging with church girls right now and it's actually awesome? You're telling me. Thanks for inviting me, man. I mean, all the stuff I have to deal with at home. You know, my mom's new boyfriend. I guess I just never knew there was a God, let alone that he actually cares for me, you know? Case. You're actually serious about this Jesus stuff, huh? Wow!, I guess I am. Who knew? Casey! Hey. How's he doing? He's resting. Janet, I'm so sorry. I've been doing a lot of thinking. I've been going about everything all wrong. You and Luke are the most important thing to me. And I promise from now on, things are gonna be totally different. You promise? I promise. I love you so much. I love you too. I'm sorry. Hey, would you two get a room already? Hey. Look who's up. How are you doing, buddy? Pretty sore. Oh, how's Case? Listen, why don't you get some rest? It's been a long day. Yeah, but Dad, how's Casey doing? Honey, you need to get your rest. What's going on? He didn't make it, son. What... what are you talking about? Where's Casey? I'm so sorry. You're lying to me. You're lying to me! Lucas, listen. Stop it. No, get off of me. No, he's outside. Let me go. It's gonna be okay. Don't touch me. Lucas, you need to get some... Don't touch me! No, I don't! Where's Casey? Come here, come here. No, get off of me! Stop it! Sweetie... Come on. I know where he is. Hey. It was a nice service. What are you still doing here? I don't think I'll ever get used to this place. I'm really sorry about your friend, Luke. Thanks. Do you want to talk about it? Not really. He never got to surf. I should have made him get out there just once. I know that it really hurts right now. I know. You just have to trust that God's in control. And this is all part of His plan for our lives. God's plan. Casey had his license for, like, a day, and now he's dead. What kind of plan is that? Maybe you should talk to Pastor Shane about it. Pastor Shane? Pastor Shane? I'm never setting foot in that place again. You don't mean that. I just think that it would help. Help. If I hadn't brought Casey to church, he'd still be here. It's little late for help. No, it's not. It's not too late. God cares about us and He wants what's best for us, Luke. So Casey dying is what's best for us. You're pathetic. Pathetic? Do you honestly think that you're the only person in the world that's ever gone through something like this? Spare me. You have no idea what I'm going through right now. Really? You see that cross over there on the hill? Do you see it? Yeah. What's the point? A year and a half ago, we buried my dad there. That was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. I thought my life was over. I hated the world just like you, okay? When I finally got the strength to open up my Bible again, the first verse I came to was Proverbs 3:5. "Trust in the Lord, your God, with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding." You see, if my dad hadn't have died when he did, then my mom and I never would have moved back here. And I never would have met you. Emily... God has a plan for you and me and Casey. And sometimes it's amazing, and it's wonderful. And sometimes it hurts. And you want to just curl up in a ball and die. But He's always there. He's always in control. And He never stops loving us. I gotta go. Luke, what are you doing here today? My shift starts in a few minutes. No, no, no, no. You're on leave. Leave? I need this job, Carl. You don't need to be here today. Now, I want you to go home and take it easy. Your job will be wailing for you when you're ready to come back. You take as much time as you need, okay? I mean it. Thanks, Carl. Hey, bro. Hey. Hey, man, I just wanted to say I'm really sorry about your buddy Casey. Thanks. Guy really cracked me up. Wish I knew him better. You would've liked him. He was my best friend. Well, maybe I'll catch you in the lineup? Yeah, maybe. All right. Take it easy. I miss you, Casey. What's up Luke? Hey Pastor Shane. Shane's just fine. Oh, okay. Mind if I sit? Pretty fun day. Why aren't you out there tearing it up? I haven't... I haven't paddled out since... since the, uh... I got ya. I'm really sorry about your friend Casey. Yeah, me too. I've lost a buddy before. Hurts for along time. And honestly... the pain never completely goes away. He was the only one that really believed in me, you know? Yeah. We all need buddies like that. Back us no matter what. What if it would have been me that died instead of Casey? I don't know where I'd be. Never really cared about it before. You know, God, church, religion, praying. I mean. Am I a bad person? I don't think you're a bad person, Luke. And honestly, it doesn't matter what I think or... anyone else thinks. You know, in the Bible it says we all have sinned. And we all fall short of the glory of God. That's why He sent Christ. He sent His own sun to die for us. To wipe away all our sins. And restore our relationship with Him. I invited Casey to youth group to have a buddy there. Someone to make fun of it all with me. But, of course, Casey gives his life to Christ and now he's in Heaven. And I have no idea where I'm gonna be. You can change that. You can change that right here, right now. Simple as that. Look at it this way. It's like the ultimate cutback on a wave. You're going one direction... and wham! Your whole life changes course. God... God has an amazing adventure for all of us, including you, Luke. But it's your decision to make. It's either yes or no to the gift that God. Has given all of us, which is salvation, man. I'm hungry. There's nothin' in there you didn't see five minutes ago. Where's Luke? Hm? I'm so hungry. Well, why don't you... Hey, wait for dinner! Go set the table. All right. Where you been? I'm starvin' here. Sorry, Dad. It's alright. Wow, this looks great. Mm-hm. Starved. What's so funny? Oh, mm, nothing, sorry. Mind if I say grace tonight? Of course not. Dear Lord, thank you so much. For my mom and dad. Thank you for their patience. And everything they've done for me. I know that you know what's best for our lives. And I'm gonna trust in you to guide, my life from now on. In Jesus name, amen. Amen. Amen. Wow, what was that about? I met with Pastor Shane and I've decided to live my life God's way. I love you and I'm so happy. I love you too, Mom. And Dad, I know I've been a real jerk lately and I promise I'm gonna change. Proud of you, son. Now, let's dig in. Let's eat. Let's eat, I'm starved. Did you make an appointment. To get your hair cut yet? Not yet. It is getting a little long, isn't it? Yeah. It's not that bad. Is everybody in school like that? It's a trend. You wouldn't know anything about it, Mom hey, I'm pretty hip. Come on. Yeah. You're not too bad. Mm-hm. Better than Dad anyway. Hey, Em, Jessica. Hey Luke, what's up? Hey Luke. Oh, I just... just came to get my paycheck. What did you guys order? Pizza. Right. I'm gonna go get some crushed red peppers. Need anything? Mind if I sit down? No, go ahead. Listen, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean the things that I said. I was an idiot. Can you forgive me? You're not an idiot. And I forgive you. It means a lot, Em. You know, you were right about this God stuff. I was lost after the accident. And God gave me a peace, you know what I mean? Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I owe it to you, Em. Well, I have to get to the surf shop. Before it closes, so... Thanks a lot for talking. Anytime. See you soon? Oh, totally. Maybe we could catch a movie sometime. Yeah, that'd be great. Awesome, all right I'll see you guys. Bye. A movie. Aww, so all is well? Yeah. Yeah, you know, there's a little wave out there right now for sure. But it's kinda like me wasting your time, you know what I mean? Yeah, a swell coming though, for sure. Okay. Luke, little bro, get over here. Welcome to the family brother. Huh? Yeah, Shane told me all about it. You're in the family now! Pastor Shane? Yeah, God's family, Lukey. Oh, man, I 'am sorry. I didn't know you were Christian. Ouch, I guess I should be a better witness, eh? Oh, no, no, no. My bad. Um, how do you know Shane? Oh man, everyone knows Shane. He's the first guy from around here to win a big contest. Pastor Shane? Yeah, man. He would have dominated the tour. If it wasn't for his accident. Wait, what accident? Ah, it's been a while now. Shane and Skip Smith, another local guy. Who was really rippin it up around here. They were headed up to the Open in Huntington. Drunk driver cumin' the other way, blasted over median and landed right in Skip's car. It was heavy. Skip died and Shane was in the hospital for a long time. He never surfed a contest again. That's insane. I mean, I heard about that but I had no idea it was Pastor Shane. Yeah, God has a way of changing our direction when He wants to. You know, we think we have it all figured out and He's like, "No, I need you over here." You know? - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, that's crazy. Yeah. Oh, I'm here to pick up my board though, so. Which one? Which one? The one Patterson shaped, the magic board. Oh man, bad news, bro. That thing's long gone. No way, man. Yeah. Yeah, I wanted to use it for the contest this weekend. Yeah, I know. I just sold it the other day, though. We still have some sweet boards back there, though. No, man. I really wanted that one, so... Sorry, bro. All right. Sorry, Luke. What's up? Hi. Tomorrow's the day. You surf in'? Yeah, I'll be there. Don't get your hopes up. Funny. One spat buddy, it's all mine. Yeah, we'll see. Hey. Oh, hey. What's up? Same old, same old. Yeah. I'm on my way to math class. Very exciting. Yeah, I know what you mean. Chemistry. Oh, fun. Um, so, I was wondering what are you doing tomorrow morning. Like, early? Okay, you're kind of scaring me. How early are you talking about? Well, I have a surf tryout tomorrow morning at 7 at the Point. Or is that too early for you? Are you asking me to come? Well, yeah. I mean, we can meet there if you want. All right, I'll see you at 7. Awesome. Bye. Bye. Nice mornin'. Mornin' Dad, what are you doin' up? Mornin' Luke. Mom? What are you guys up to? Didn't think we'd let you go to the tryouts without us, did you? Come on, I'll drive. Okay. You're not gone need that, Luke. Dad, I need my board. No way. Way. You gotta be ki... where did you... how did you know? Do you like it? Are you kidding me? It's perfect! It's... it's the magic board. Well, it's a big tryout, right? And you're gonna need all the help you can get and we just wanted to do somethin' for ya. We're real proud of ya. You guys are the best. I love you guys so much. All right now, we're gonna be late. Let's go. Come on. Wait, wait, wait, Dad, one second. Well, how you feelin', son? Ready to go? Yeah, feeling good, Dad. No way. Dad, honk the horn. Hey, who's that with Pastor Shane? That's Emily from church. She actually came. She's so cute. Any last minute advice? Nah, you're gonna do fine, man. Get out there, do your best. Trust God for the rest, all right? - Go! - Go, man, go! And I was like, "Where did he go?" She's like, "Oh, he went surfing at the Jedi." I was like, "Do you mean the jetty'?" She's like, "No, he definitely said the Jedi." Yo, Lukey, how much, man? $48.50. Ouch. Here you go. - Thanks. - Thanks, man. Luke. Grab a slice and take a seat, my friend. All right, guys, let's get started. But first off, let's welcome the two new members of our team. Matt McCoy and Luke Harris. So, what now? I don't know. A big contest comin'up soon. See how it goes. Just learning to trust God more each day. That's good. I'm proud of you. So, um, what about college? Ugh... I start at City in the fall. Can't wait. Hey, it'll be good for you. Right, and what about you? You all packed up for the dorms back east? Not quite. What do you mean not quite? Well, there might be a slight change of plans. Huh? Do you know how much money you can save getting your lower division classes out of the way at a community college? Hold on a sec. Now, what are you saying? Just saying that maybe you'll be seeing me around campus in the fall. You're serious? No way! That's great. Yeah, I think so, too. Wow. Well, maybe we can take some classes together? Maybe, if you're lucky. If I'm lucky. Get out of here. No, no, no!
