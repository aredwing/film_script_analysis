For similar sentences i send other soldiers to jail. Focus, please. - I cannot believe it. - What can i do, i'm an animal. It's a rabbit! He is looking at us. Hurry up! Ofir, shut your mouth. Gotta pee, Damn... Call Yossi for me! Ask him out, Or you'll have to deal with me. - I'm afraid. - About what? Yaeli, in the worst scenario send him to hell. Ciao, Goldi. Gotta go, they are calling me. Hi guys! what a crazy bud! - Ofir, how are you doing? - Great. You look good! i wear the lens. you look good as well, did you have an hair cut? - How are you doing? - Freezing out. - Did you come back this morning? - Yes. Refrigerators got broken and the meat got spoiled. do you know where is Jagger? Where is Yossi? Went with Jagger to the field to check the model. - Didn't they go already? - Is there some problem. I'm going in. Do you have the key to your room? - It's on the door. - Fine. I'm going to be a bit busy, do not disturb me. Do you need anything? warn the chef that i'm here, i'll be hungry later. Already? Don't get your head bigger. - What is it? - A transistor, a gift from my mom. Who knows if it connects here. Rita! I cannot believe you are going to leave. Why don't you leave as well? We'll leave for the east. Why you insist to stick in the army, you already got yourself an officer. - You can't be without me. - Calm down. Let's go under the light not under the shadow. Till when we are goin to continue... Do you really like this gay music. Here Radio Normality. We have online Yossi, a tough, commander of company, a real fag who ask to listen Meir Ariel. Tell me something of your moments of fear, it's easier let them put it in your ass. come, let's loose the fog. Let's go under the light and not under the shadow. Till when we are going to continue... Generally i bang only the fighters. This time i say: ''Oneg, if you do the pilot, i'll be a parachooper.'' - Is Oneg his real name? - I swear! It's too cute. In the tibetan buddism it's a good name to have. I almost forgot, i brought some movies, hope you like them. Adams, check if there is some tibetan movie for you. Give it to me. ''Stand by me'' ? Where is ''Fuck me 2'' and ''horny Mission 3''? I need you. Stand ease. It's all garbage ! Tell him the kitchen is closed. - What's missing? - What doesn't it missing! there is nothing fresh, a part from some chiken. just boxes and they all stinks. Prepare for him a sushi of meat, He likes it very mutch. Everything is going to be all right. Hadad, open ten boxes of meat, Sasi, warm the water. Its going to be all right, go. wait, do you want to help? Get some aromatic grass. Hadad, move your ass. Did you know that 2 years ago i travested myself as a rabbit? you should see the pictures! With the ears like this. Shit, what are you doing here? please verify that at the check point they aren't masturbating themselves. i'm serious. - What are you doing here? - Hi. - You know where is Yoel? - No. Yossi, wait a sec! wait! i see also Goldi is here. Say, Isn't Jagger back with you? Yes, he is in the control point, why? You and Jagger are close, right? In which sense? what did you hear about that? that you are a sort of couple. no? What? Well, that you are his friend. I like him very much and i thought to ask him out, maybe one of these days, during the weekend. I don't know... Are you sure you really want it? Sometime female soldiers think to be in love with their commanders but it's an illusion, the uniform and ranks can be confusing. i'm not confused, i'm sure i feel something for him. Jagger is fantastic. No offense, but he is not likr other men. Not only cause he is cute, with those lips... also that, but not only that. he's simple, and different. I guess he realy has it. You know if he has someone already? Have you been here the whole time? No, i just arrived. - Everything ok here? - Yes, fine. If it's true, why not saying perfect? Are you ok? Perfectly. Let's go eat. Where have you been? This place is dirty like hell. Did you tell him? Disgusting, have to wash my hair. - Maybe you should come with me? - Don't know, haven't seen Jagger yet. What are you doing? I told you for 5 minutes. Do you think this is the way to cut? -Have you been told you are a nazi? -I'm an artist. A nazi artist. Make sure the bread is on the table, i can take care of myself. I'm starving... Yaniv! On my way! Did you come to eat or something happened? There are good news. First of all the spring rolls ''California'' home made. Get some. Heavenly. You're a genious! - What are you doing here? - i have no clue. Sure? what do you mean? You have been the whole morning with Yossi. He didn't say anything? I doubt he knew something about it. They are more than simple warnings, they are already in the stripe, they'll get in today and it's going to get ugly. And this should be the good news? Yaniv, give me more please! Why bad? War is always a good thing. The smell of burned meat early in the morning ! Relax, where is your sense of humor go? Tonight we are going to kick their asses, or we are screwed. Grilled chicken with triumph local grass and zenzero. Weather you like it or not, you won't leave here, you won't go to Cordon Bleu school, promise ! I promise to invite you in some years to my restaurant, french,lebanese, not to miss. - There is bad karma on this table. - What ? The light of their aura is terrible. There is a limit to everything. They were 3 days in the mog under the snow, it's not wise to let them out again. Did you become gay? are you their mom ? I have a mission to accomplish, did you forget? No, but we came back just an hour ago they are tired, they can't get into action again. And with the full moon they will see us till turkey. - Why don't you bomb them from the top? - bullshit! Who cares of the full moon! In a while you'll tell me that Mercury is retreating. I hate the idea for another ambush tonight! Let's hope it will be a traumatic ambush, I forgot why i became comando. in an ambush you can't do nothing, you just eat salami and chocolate. we only miss the waitress that serve cappuccino to be as the fags of Shenkin. ''Any interest in the menu of the day?'' Animal, i hope you die in lebannon. You would like to fuck as the fags of Shenkin, they screw like you'll never fuck in your whole life. Did you take it in the ass? You walk in a odd way... What are all these bullshits? We are just joking. why are you laughing? Psycho, what would you do if i'd tell you i'm a fag? - Can i speak to you honestly. sir? - Go ahead. You are cute as a female, i'd screw you. I thought you didn't know what's going on there. I'm out. Let's focus on the details. Let's finish eating first. do you mind if i say it to the soldiers now? Be my guest. Guys, we're going to another ambush overnight. I know you planned to rest, but listen, it won't be any easy. everyone will be responsible of their own stuff. I don't want surprises tonight. It's 10 past 13:00, there is not mutch time, i see you in an hour in the instructions room. Its going to be allright, don't worry. warm? Tell me something, It doesn't bug you he is married ? On the contrary, i'm here to have fun, not to get married. - Are you in love with him? - What are these questions? You might be laughing, but in high school i used to like the guys like Yoel. At the beginning he tried to do the sensitive man, but who looks for preliminares? Thus i told him: ''Leave to me the clitoris, you take care about the fucking.'' - And what did he say? - It's what he wanted to hear. really? I don't know what to say. I'm looking for somehting different, someone who is male, but also with good manners, that hugs me, caress me and kiss me everywhere. But in the end, he fucks you , ain't it? well! - Stop teasing me. - I'm not teasing you. I understand what you say, but i decided, i'm going to bed only with someone i'm inlove with, this way it will be perfect, with the bathroom full of foam, and the candels romantic music and chapmpagne slowly, slowly... - Where have you been? - Nowhere. - I know why the commander arrived. - Wh? - The ambush. - Are you sure? Bugger! Talk with Yossi, i have to go to give rest to the sentinel. You really have no limits! We should meet when we're home once. - Do you have a crash for me? - Yes, but not like for Jagger. Bitch, give me a kiss. - Who is the cutest here? - Me? Bravo! - He is not here. - wait for him. Mission to accomplish, did you forget? Ciao. How much violence, what nerve, with so much compassion i cuddle. people suffer to much from love. Beg me tonight, cry for me. No matter how difficult is, i'm always under the impression that is not enough, that there is still a lot to do and i get scared and run away. i can't be happy. and i can't be sad. the world is tough, i can make it only with the force, just with crazy acts. I hope everything burn, whispering, beg me, beg me... i came to your window to play with guitar and flowers... - What are you doing here? - You didn't stay for the dessert. Yossi, The commander is looking for you. On my way. Hi. - is my bed comfortable? - Sorry, didn't know it's yours. Doesn't matter, I'm only joking. - Do you like it? - I don't know it. You look great today. Goldi made me up. - Isn't it too much? - No, but you don't need it. - I'm waiting for Jagger, do you know where he is? - No. - Ok, i'm leaving. - Wait, i have to talk to you. What's up? - You are hopeless with him. - With whom? with Jagger? i don't think he is the guy for you. How do you know? did he talk about me? did he tell you anything? take it easy. and even if you are not his type, it's his problem. Yaeli, everyone would like to have you. you smell so good. Ofir! what are you doing, are you crazy? how could i forget? You sleep with someone only for love.. are you nutts? you have an ambush tonight, go back to work! hi.

I guess you didn't understand that this is going to be a hot ambush. you thought i was going to distribute blankets and chocolate? with hot ambush i meant it's going to be cold and this cause you are going to loose blood, cause Samucha enlightned us with the watch and Sasi went out with the broken stretcher. i know you are tired and that not everyone understand why we go out again, but you don't have to know always everything. i'm asking you to make an effort, be professional and be caeful. because i have no intention to meet your mothers soon. not today, not tomorrow maybe at your wedding if you remember to invite me. start couting yourself. - One. - Two...
