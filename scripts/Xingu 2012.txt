THE MARCH WEST. - the March West. CLEARING THE WAY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF BRAZIL RONCADOR XINGU EXPEDITION LEAVING SOON An expedition into the unknown regions of Central Brazil. To open trails, build airstrips... explore, and take control of the region. Dozens upon dozens of peasants enlisted, eager for the measly wages. Me and my brother enlisted eager for adventure. There... You look horrible. It'll work. Hired gun. Put your mark here. - Get your things. Name? - Agripino Pinto Silva. - Age? - 50. - Schooling? - No, sir. Get your things. - Name? - Jose Carlos. - Age? - 25. - Any schooling? - No, sir. Take your things. - What was your last job? - I'm a peon. - Name? - Joao Carlos Santos da Silva, sir. Almiro Almeida, sir. Joao Pereira dos Santos. Ariosvaldo Custodio da Silva. - Age? - 29. - Schooling. - None. - Last job? - Miner. Get your things. - Name? - Claudio Villas Boas. - What? - Claudio Villas Boas. Schoofing? No, sir. - Last job? - Workman. Sign here, please. Leonardo Villas Boas, 24. I'm not picky, no, sir. - Name? - Joao Pereira dos Santos. - Age? - 40. To walk where no on has walked before. Go where no one has gone. I don't really know why... but it seemed liked an irresistible idea. CITY OF SAO PAULO Mr. Orlando, a telegram from your brother. Thank you. PEONS HIRED WAITING FOR THIRD ILLITERATE CLAUDIO AND LEONARDO We went to good schools. - Had decent jobs. - Mark! That's it! But we traded it all for life in the wild. RONCADOR - XINGU EXPEDITION VANGUARD Colo! Time to move! OK, let's go. We're losing time. Put out the fire. We always knew we could only be really free... - It's the tributary of Xingu River. - In the great outdoors. Go suck the devil's blood in hell. And you too, you little prick. Not even dad's farm had so many ticks. Listen. Is it a jaguar? That's no jaguar. It's Indians. Shit! - Shit. - Calm down, everybody OK? - Lower your gun, damn it. - Shit! - Put this out. - Check the mules. Put out the fire. Put it out, put it out! They're going to kill us. But we can't kill them back. Colo? Colo, look at this. Look at this club, man. Mr. Claudio, more than 20 Indians came this way. Let's get out of here, Colo. We can go back from here. - Calm down! - Let's go back. Take it easy, Leonardo, calm down. It's the Indians. Something's strange. What's all this smoke here? There's smoke here, Colo. - Here too! - They're surrounding us. - They want to cook us alive. - Lower your gun! Get down. Shoot into the air. Into the air. Let's get off their land. - Good idea! - Let's go. Break camp. Let's go, guys. Let's get out of here! What the government called unoccupied land... in reality, had owners. Orlando? A fish trap. XINGU RIVER Orlando? Look, over there. Hide your guns. Indians. Lower your gun. Take it easy. Claudio, there's too many. There's more over there, look. On the left. Leonardo. Row. Let's go, let's get out of here. Go! Shit, he's going to shoot! - He's going to shoot! - Leonardo, calm down! - Calm down, Leonardo. - Go to the other side. Shit, row! What are going to do here? - Wait. - Wait for what? Nothing, just wait. You're all crazy, let's go, let's get out of here. - Let's go. - Leonardo! Take it easy! We're going to have to talk to them sooner or later. We can't keep running from them forever. They don't look like Xavantes. Yeah, they aren't. Try this. Orlando. Come on. - Orlando, Orlando, should I go too? - No. Stay here. Orlando. Claudio. Orlando. Claudio. Villas Boas. Give them whatever we've got. Sugar. What in the world? - What's going on? - Where're they going? Watch. Airplane. Land. Land. Airstrip. We need an airstrip. - Colo? - What? All flat. East, west. All flat. This is a good place. Another three meters that way. Thou shall not covet the Indians' women. Leonardo, I'm serious. We're going to fly over the airstrip before landing. JACARE AIRSTRIP ONE YEAR AFTER FIRST CONTAC Airplane. Flying over now. - Airplane. - Fly over here. Right. It isn't going to land now. It will land later. It's coming, look. Look. It's coming. Look at the airplane, look. Hey! Wait. Izaquiri, hey! Izaquiri! - They're scared. - Who wouldn't be? Come on. - Minister, sir. - Orlando. - At your service. - How are you? - How was your trip? - Fine. Where are the Indians? They hid when the plane landed. You did a good job. To come this far without killing one Indian nor losing one white man. That was our deal. - Right, congratulations. - Thank you. And this is only the beginning. We're going to build a major outpost here. This will be a city one day. And, at the same time, we'll continue with the trail north. You'll have to keep to the plan. The next airstrip has to be finished, at the most... by next year. - Leaders? - Yeah. I knew you'd accept. I have to talk to Claudio. I'll go call him. Orlando, hire as many peons as you need. Money isn't a problem. I'll send you a plane, motorboats... everything you need. Excuse me. - What's he doing? - Look at Colo. Colo! Holy shit! What a utopia, man! I could never have imagined. Look at that one there. PEACEFUL EXISTENCE BETWEEN WHITE MAN AND INDIANS TRIBES CONTACTED IN UPPER XINGU For me, they weren't savages. I had merely come face to face with another civilization. VILLAGES IN UPPER XINGU This encounter would change our lives forever. This'll make you feel better. What is it? What's wrong, Tatomai? Sick people, at the village. - At the village? - The village. Wait here, Tatomai. We'll help you. Medicine. It'll do her good. Make her better. Calm down, calm down. This will make you better. They don't have the slightest idea what this is. They've never had the flu before. And they never would have if it hadn't been for us. - Come. - Help me. We're out of penicillin. Out of penicillin? The Indians have all got the flue! We need more penicillin fast! Oh no! Not the chief! They're all dying, an epidemic! This is an emergency, buy more! Colonel! - Let's go, we're going up. Let's go. - You're crazy. Let's go! Let's go, damn it! There is no way we can fly in this weather! Leonardo! Have you seen Orlando? Where's Orlando? The flu wiped out half the village. It took Izaquiri. And then spread throughout the Upper Xingu. And now? What do we do now? I don't know. All I know is that white people can't come in any more. They'll come anyway, Claudio. If we can't control them, I won't stay. We can't just leave now. If they want us, it has to be on our own terms, Claudio. We have to impose our own conditions. We can bring a doctor in, medicine, vaccines. We'll take care of them, Claudio. We take care of these and do away with the ones we meet later. That's just the way it is. We'll be the poison and the antidote. Either that, or worst. It won't hurt at all, you'll see. It's just a small prick. Just a prick. There, that's it. - A bee sting. - We're vaccinating you all... - against the white mans' diseases. - Pass me the cotton. Hey, girl! Let's do you now? Good, good. Take it easy. NORTH XINGU RIVER Repeat, we need more fuel to continue north. UPPER XINGU OUTPOST. - Confirming request for more fuel. Repeat, more fuel. Over and out. When the fuel arrives, take half and hide it. For the doctor. They all need gas. - Chief. - My student! How are you? This is the chief. This is Noel. Noel, Doctor Noel. - This is Marina. - Marina. We felt responsible for everything that might... happen to them. After all, they weren't the ones who came looking for us. We were the ones who had trespassed on their land. Come, closer. Put your chest here, like that. Closer, that's it. It was only fair that we protected them... against everything and everyone. We have come here to bring medicine... 12th VILLAGE CONTACTED. LOWER XINGU GOOD PLACE FOR OUTPOS Villa Boa. Villa Boa. Come down, come down. Villa Boa. Get your gun. Lower it. Come, come closer. Villa Boa? Claudio Villas Boas. Prepori, Caiabi. - Were you looking for me, Prepori? - I have heard about you. - Caiabi is traveling alone? - No. Come. Who is he? - Pionim. - Pionim? My woman, Carolina. My son, Tefu. Give them some food. Come closer. My father's father worked with the rubber trees. Worked for the white man. Caiabi suffer. Rubber tappers no give food to Caiabi. Work, work, for rubber tappers no give food. Rubber tappers kill my children. Kill eight of my children. Only one left. This is why I come with my family looking for you. Villas Boas. Because I hear about your name. Take this. For you. - For me? - I have another one. To protect your boy. This way. My brothers. Leonardo, Orlando. This is Prepori. Pionim, Carolina, Prepori's woman. They are Caiabi and will be staying here with us. Welcome. Come, feel at home. Hi. These are our friends, Prepori, Pionim. They are Caiabi. They will be staying here at the outpost with us now, OK? Totomai, they are not going to the village. They will live here at the outpost. Totomai, they are our responsibility. We are responsible. You can't fight each other, we have to help each other. The white man is the enemy. Smoke. White mans' gun. He's Trumai. The Trumai village is just up ahead. Take them to the boat, to the boat, go! To the boat! Prepori! Calm down, calm down. That's it. You alright? Everything's OK. Drink, that's it. - What's her name? - Kaiulu. The chief's daughter. Fences are what work. Fence in the villages and don't let the white man in. Yeah, Rondon is already doing that. Only, with small reservations. Adapt Indians to civilization. That's one way to do it, but I don't think it works. No, it doesn't. The Caiabis... have been working for the white man for many generations... and they're scattered all around. If we don't get them together, they'll all be gone, fast. To civilize them is the fastest way to finish them off. What we have to do is separate a large area. Almost a whole country. That's it. A place where they'll be safe. - Protected. - An empire of Xingu tribes. Our land has forest, animals and water to drink. We have rivers full of fish for our children to eat. We need a very big piece of land. We are the owners of the land. Caiabi is right. Our land is where we live. - Your land. - Our land. ISOLATE AVOID CONTAC Here. For you. BRAZILIAN AIR FORCE - Prepori! - Hi. Go get Claudio. It's an old dream. A military base in the Cachimbo Mountains? That is not our job at all. Airstrips are one thing, Military bases are another. Two completely different things. It's a personal favor you do the president. Something the Americans have been on our backs about for years. The problem with Cachimbo is access. That's why your name was brought up, right, captain? - A nationwide consensus. - The governor will help any way he can. The ranchers too, with planes, fuel, whatever you need. Military presence in a region as abandoned as ours... is more than welcome. A military base in the Cachimbo Mountains would be a disaster. One of the last untouched Indian tribes in the region. The Kreen-akarori. A military base in the Kreen's land. - Who? Whose land? - Kreen-akarori. The giants of the north. General, Claudio is right. Any hasty contact could finish them off in no time. You take care of that. Isn't that what you do? I propose a trade. We make the base, clear the trail... - And? - In exchange... you isolate an area... a large area, for the Xingu Indians. A campsite? An outpost? I don't think the governor would be opposed. We could throw in a couple hectares ourselves. No, a campsite, no. An Indian park. An Indian city, is that it? A city, no. A state. I can talk it over with the president. But I can't promise anything. Land is always pretty touchy business. Always very disputed. Great cattle land that, too. How long will it take for you to deliver the base? - General... - You set the date. - We have a deal? - A deal. It's a deal. The base in exchange for the reservation. This time, Orlando outdid himself. XINGU INDIANS MAY BE GRANTED OWNERSHIP OF LAND Caiabi help build base... and later we'll make a big Caiabi village on the reservation. On the land the white chiefs are going to give us. Will white men be able to trespass and kill Indians... like they do now? You have my word. THE DEFENDERS OF INDIANS Those outside, can't come in. But, those inside can't leave either. Principally health agents. - Marina has a fiance in Sao Paulo. - Fiance? He's out, can't come in. CACHIMBO MOUNTAINS Shit, Leonard. Fucking reporter. VILLAS BOAS GETS INDIAN GIRL PREGNANT. - Reporters don't do anything... by themselves. Just when everybody has their eyes on us. - Yeah, like I'm the only one. - What? Let's fly over the ridge and find a plateau. I like her, Orlando. I like her. There's a lot more important things at stake here. Like what? What, Leonardo? The park, Leonardo. The Indians. - What's going on? - What was that? I don't know. - We're losing power. - Keep this thing in the air, Adilson. - What's that? - I don't know. The engine. - Go back if you have to, Adilson. - Calm down, Adilson. - Calm down, Adilson. - Higher, Adilson. Go up, the mountain! We're going to hit! - Keep her going, Adilson! - We're going down! Up, go UP! - I'm going to land. - Watch it, Adilson. Shit, this thing is going to crash! Hold on! I just can't understand it, we just checked the engine. Unless somebody tampered with it. What, Adilson? Somebody might have tampered with the plane. Tampered, how? Everyone wants to get rid of you guys. They'll tell you that in any two-bit bar in Xavantina. I can't believe it. What happened to your leg, Adilson? We have accidentally found a good place for a base. It's begun. Indians. - It's the Kreen. - The giants? They heard the plane and came up the mountain to see. Do you know what these Indians do to white folk? Neither he nor you know that, Adilson. No white man has ever seen a Kreen. Claudio, what are we going to do with Leonardo? There's too much pressure. They'll do everything they can to stop us. We're going to have to amputate Adilson's leg. I'm not going to amputate anybody's leg. - He's going to die. - Let him die with both his legs. More dignified to be able to walk into heaven. Claudio, if we don't cut if off, he'll die. We're all going to die, pale face, all of us. I'm not going to die! You guys can die, if you want to. Claudio, Orlando isn't going to die. I haven't come this far just to up and die. He's decided he isn't going to die. - Claudio isn't going to die either. - You hear that, Colo? You're not going to die either. - We came here for a reason... - Yeah, a great reason. Install a military base right on top of the Kreen's head. And they live out in the middle of nowhere. I'm hungry- I want to leave. I want to get out of here! - You are already out anyway, Leonardo. - Shut up, Orlando. You're out, you fucked up. - Enough! - You're out! And who's going to make me go, Orlando? Who? You? You did it to yourself. I see, Orlando. You're scared of losing your job? Is that it? It's all yours, isn't it, Orlando? This is all yours. Huh, Orlando? You want it all for yourself, is that it? Stop it! Stop it! Hey! We've located the Villas Boas's plane in the Cachimbo Mountains. LEONARDO VILLAS BOAS ABANDONS EXPEDITION LEONARDO AND HIS INDIAN DAUGHTER VILLAS BOAS REPLY: "WE WON'T GIVE UP" INAUGURATION OF CACHIMBO MILITARY BASE TWO YEARS LATER This is our white chief. Chief Awara. Chief Kuikuru. Chief Kalapalo. Are they the ones who are going to give us land? That was the deal. And give today? It's not fair, we had an agreement. Lot's of people are interested in that land, Orlandinho. A symbolic gesture from the governor. Could be a cattle ranch, plantation... Anything you like. That land already has an owner. Excuse me. They're handing out land deeds. The bastards! We're on our own now. Orlando, I gave my word to the Caiabi... that they would get their village. I know, but we're wasting time, we won't be able to do anything here. We've got to set up a front. I'll go to Rio, Sao Paulo. Janio promised me he'd help. And you get back to the outpost... keep the white folks out any way you can. If you can. FARMLAND GAINS GROUND IN MATO GROSSO FOREST AREAS GIVE WAY TO GRAIN FIELDS What do they think they're doing? Assholes! Just look! Shit! Let's go. Let's go! - I'll go with you. - No. - Where's your boss? - Up at the ranch house. The ranch house? So, let's go talk to the fat bastard. - Show some respect, huh, mister. - Yeah. Exactly what you should be showing more of for this land here. What do you think you're doing? This is Indian territory. - And since when do Indians own land? - Since always. You're trespassing on their land. This is Trumai territory. Trumai territory my ass, this is my land. The governor himself gave it to me. I think you all better leave I'm warning you. Nobody here is afraid of Indians, buddy. And they're not afraid of you either, boy! You should be. White people who defend Indians, for us... is worse than Indians themselves. I'm warning you, you hear! I'm warning you! I warned them. I found this near your village. We hold the governor of Mato Grosso personally responsible... for the present state of war in the Xingu region. And his blundering policy of the random distribution... of the ancestral lands of the Indian people. Orlando, one more question please. One more question. White folks are sure to start invading those lands now... don't you think, Darci? The official position is... to occupy the Brazilian territory and integrate Indians into society. Civilized Indians. Does that exist, huh? You're right... civilized Indians aren't Indians, are they? They're civilized. You get me? Goodbye culture, beliefs, their differences. Goodbye Indians. Exactly why we want to isolate them. To retard this process. One day, they'll all have to integrate... but this way they'll be prepared for it. Three million hectares should be enough to accommodate everyone. I can't take this into my own hands, Orlando. I could be arrested, you know that? But revoke the land deeds in that region that you can do. The governor is cutting the whole region up in small pieces. Minister, just clean out the area. No ranchers, miners, nobody saying that they own the land. That you can do. Put it all down on paper, prepare a document. A map, defining the borders, OK? PROJECT FOR XINGU INDIAN PARK BORDERS. - They've never had borders before. But now, borders were the best thing they could have. VILLAGES ALREADY ESTABLISHED OUTPOSTS Thank you. But, this is bigger than Belgium, Orlando. It's Belgium that is small. Governor, it'll be the largest Indian park in the world. Take out the word "Indian". Call it just "Xingu Park". Nobody likes Indians in Brazil, son. Well, to please everyone then, I'll call it "National Xingu Park". The military love anything that is "national". When you become president, the park will be created. It's not "when", but "if". Endeavoring to preserve the fauna and flora of our country... recently appointed president, Janio Quadros... has just signed decree number 50.455... dated April 14, 1961... authorizing the creation of the National Xingu Park. Belgium is ours, Claudio! - Located on the Xingu River... - Wait, keep it down. And measuring over 2 million square kilometers... the park will be administrated... by the Villas Boas brothers Orlando and Claudio Villas Boas. And will be home to the Indian peoples that have inhabited the region... now for generations. Marry me? - When? Today? - Today. Orlando. The radio. Orlando. What is it, Orlando? What is it? Leonardo... His heart. No! What's wrong, Claudio? What is it? He was my brother too. And did that make any difference when you sent him away? All it took was for some white chief to ask, right, Orlando? - White chiefs exist, Claudio. - They exist. And you've been obeying them now for 20 years. You obey them too. You cleared airstrips... contacted Indians who had never seen a white man in their life. You obey them too. You do a little more than just obey. You play their game. Who put the Caiabi to work? Who promised them a village? You play their game too, Claudio! And we're going to have to keep on playing... to keep this place standing. And if you want to talk about Leonardo, let me tell you something... Leonardo left because he fucked up. And you watch your step if don't want to go down the same path. We're leaving. I have to take care of the park's northern boundary. We're going to unite all your people, like I promised... and make a big village there. And Prepori is going to be the chief. And you, Pionim... are going to live with me at the outpost there, at Diauarum. You'll work with me there. I'm a Caiabi too, why can't I go to the village with them? Because you're coming with me to the outpost. LEONARDO OUTPOS NATIONAL XINGU PARK Pionim, go sleep in the other house. And take your things too. The Caiabi were scattered throughout southern Para. Bringing them into the park wasn't going to be easy. OPERATION CAIABI The park might be a safe haven, but it wasn't their land. I came here with Claudio to get you all... and take you back to the Xingu. We have our own land there. The white man here is destroying our land. We'll have our own village in the Xingu. I need more gasoline, Orlando. Much more. Don't you want it, huh? There is land for all of us in the Xingu. We have boats to take you all. You can hunt in the Xingu, fish. No one can tell you what to do. Come on, go, come. Go, go, go. Hurry up! Go! I need first aid medicine, fast. Many Caiabi are coming into the Xingu. We'll build more villages. MILITARY GOVERNMEN HAS PLANS FOR AMAZON REGION You've got to act fast, Claudio. The military government has their eyes on the Amazon region. THIRD YEAR OF OPERATION CAIABI Go, go go- The miners are getting closer. What is it? What's going on? - He doesn't want to go. - What's your problem? I work here, make money here... so, I'm going to stay here with my family! This is white man's land. In the village, the park, where the Caiabi are. That's where your land is, you have to go there! Look, my boss is coming. You come now. With your family. You come now! Go! Go on, get in! Come on! Let's go! Go, go! I'm tired, Tauarru. Colo! Colo! Claudio! - Do Indians exist? - Belgium is ours, Claudio! - The Xingu nations. - You obey them too. Orlando isn't going... You'll be going down the same path. White people who protect Indians, for us, are worse than Indians. He's decided he's not going to die. You play their game too, Claudio. - What's her name? - Who promised them a village? Civilizing them is the fastest way... And we're going... It'll be the longest highway in the world. You see where they cross here? The highway is going to to cut through the forest. The Transamazon Highway. But, does it have to run right through here? Couldn't you just move it over to the side a bit... Or, maybe make a detour here, just to go around this part... Orlando, what are you doing? This is the Kreen's land. Orlando, I don't know if you've noticed... but the highways have, so far, respected your boundaries. I know, and I thank you for your consideration. But the Kreen, they've never seen a white man before. They could react badly. Get them out, clear the way. But, make it quick. Major, couldn't we just leave them where they are a bit longer... - in isolation... - No way. And besides, we don't think that isolation is good for anyone. Progress, that's what's good. - Even for Indians. - No, no it isn't. Sorry to disagree with you, but it isn't. And even for us, I have my doubts. But, for them, progress is neither good, nor necessary. Work has already begun. Hundreds of peons. And peons, you know, right? Are all very ignorant people. Claudio? Claudio! Come here. Orlando? We're going to have to go and save the Kreen, Claudio. The Kreen? The first part of the highway goes through here. Right through their land. Impossible, they can't do that. do something. This can't happen, Orlando. It's no use, these people won't listen, Claudio. The Kreen are the last ones, Orlando. Let's go and get them. Bring them into the park. Something inside them dies forever as soon as we get near. I'm not going after the Kreen. You go if you want. I won't lay a finger on the Kreen. I have a question to ask you. Why did you want to save the Caiabi so bad... and you can't save the Kreen? We help those who are already lost. And the Kreen, aren't they going to be lost? The way the Kreen were will never be again. But they will be another way. Claudio. TWO YEARS LATER To walk where no one has walked before. Go where no white man has ever gone. Because there is no place where the white man can't go. To get there before the others... was all that we could ever do.
