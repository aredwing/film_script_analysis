Christopher Robin had toy animals to play with. And together they had many remarkable adventures... in an enchanted place... called the Hundred Acre Wood. But of all his animal friends... Christopher Robin's very best friend... was a bear called Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh? Wait halfa darn minute! It seems to me that most of these stories are about that silly old bear. Well, then, Tigger, who should this story be about? Well, I happen to know someone... who's extremely fascinatin', not to mention handsome and debonair-y. But the title already says Winnie the Pooh. Oh, that's easy to fix. There! Now, that's a wonderful title. And speaking of wonderful things-- Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! The wonderful thing about tiggers is tiggers are wonderful things Their tops are made out of rubber their bottoms are made out of springs They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm the only one Tiggers are cuddly fell as Tiggers are awfully sweet Everyone el-es is jealous That's why I repeat and repeat The wonderful thing about tiggers is tiggers are marvellous chaps They're loaded with vim and with vigour they love to leap in your laps They're jumpy, bumpy, clumpy, pumpy Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm the only one I'm the only-- Hello! I'm Tigger. That's T-l-double-geh-er. - And that's me. Hoo, hoo, hoo! - I know. You've bounced me lots and lots of times. Yeah. Fun, ain't it? Say, you want to go bouncin' with me, on account of bouncin's what tiggers do the-- eh, best. - Eww. - Well... I would go bouncing with you, Tigger... except that I must count all these honey pots... to be sure that I have enough for winter. Let me get that, please. - Bother. - Yech! What do these Pooh bears like about this icky, sticky stuff anyway? Well, no time for goofi n' off. I've got dawdlin' to do. Hoo, hoo! T.T.F.N.! Ta-ta for now! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Oh, d-d-dear, dear. Hiya, Piglet, old pal! What say you and I do a little bouncin' together? B-B-Bouncing? Oh, my! I-l haven't enough firewood to last the winter, and-- Why, sure, you do! Why, there's lots of firewood. What's this? It's lyin' all over the place. - Whoa! Whoa! - There. See? - Now we can go bouncin'. - B-But... I would really rather prefer that my firewood... not have quite so much chair in it. Oh. Well, then, uh, T.T.F.N.! Gotta be bouncin' along! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Well, hello there! And good mornin', Mrs Kanga, ma'am! Well, good morning, Tigger, dear. She called me "dear." Pardon me for askin', but you wouldn't happen to be interested... in doin' a bit of bouncin' with me, would ya? Well, I'm afraid I have just too much to do this morning, dear. Oh. Well, if you have to-- See ya later. Bye. Tigger! Tigger! Tigger. Oh. I wonder why nobody wants to bounce with me. Oh, well. What am I talkin' about? There's plenty of others I haven't even asked yet. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! And so, the others all came 'round... to see what they might do to help. But the end of Eeyore's house was merely the beginning... of a very unfortunate day. Wow! Look at the size of it. Your attention, uh, please. I have officially completed the plans. - What plans? - The plans for removing this boulder... and restoring to Eeyore, uh, his happy home. No need to bother on my account. All we need is a little, uh, uh, team effort. Rabbit's Rock Remover! Now, then, Pooh bear, release the counterweight. Kanga and Roo... start depressurizing the granite extractor. Piglet? Piglet... start pulling your own weight over there. But l-- I don't weigh anything. A-- A little more over there. Yes. That's good. No, no, no, no, no, no! Over here. This way. This way. All right, now-- - Oh, good. I think-- - Bother. - Oh, my. - Oh! Well, now, why didn't it work? Oh, let's see here now. - The counterweight-- - Perhaps we could use another helping hand. Yes. All we really need is-- - Tigger! - Hello, you blokes! - Anyone up for a little bouncin'? - No! No! No bouncing! Look! Just look at all this work we have to do! What? Movin' that old thing? Hoo, hoo! Not a problem. All you need is a little bouncin'. How will b-bouncing move the rock, T-Tigger? Tut, tut, tut. Not now, Piglet. If maybe we had a little, uh-- Mm-hmm. Right there! "Bouncing will move this boulder." It's almost amusing. Whoo! Oh! Help! Whoa! Wow! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Now that that's outta the way... who's up for a little bouncin'? What is it with you and bouncing? Just look at my rock remover. Everything's ruined... and all you can think about is bouncing! But that's what tiggers do best. Exactly. Unlike us. I'm afraid he's right, dear. Wh-What we're trying to say is that, uh... we really can't bounce like tiggers... anyway because, uh-- We're not tiggers. Who needs them other fell as anyhow? Mostly I'm happy and I'm bouncy Because lam the on liest one But now all at once I feel so lonely For someone like me Someone like me Right now I'm sort offeerin 'downcy I'm just about the loneliest one And deep in my heart I'm sort of wishin' For someone like me Someone like me Somebody with springs and things Who laughs and sings And jumps everyday Somebody who's fun, fun, fun Who loves to trounce and pounce And bounce their gloomies away Howl dream there is another A double or a triple of me To keep him company But since I'm awake I feel so lonely Because I know it can't be It never can be Bein' that I'm the one and on liest Someone Like me Someone like me Tigger? Um-- T-Tigger? Don't be sad, Tigger. Wh-Why don't you go bouncin'? That'll cheer you up. No one to bounce with, Roo boy. Oh. Well... what about another tigger? Another tigger? Well, that-- No, it's-- it's impossibibble. It's crazy. I'm the on liest one. But aren't there other tiggers? I've got a mama. Don't you have a family somewhere too? Why, that's ridic-- Uh-- I mean-- Ooh, a family full of tiggers, you say. Hoo, hoo. Can you imaginate such a thing? Why, that'd be more tiggers than you could stick a shake at. And we'd all be bouncin'! Bouncin' morning, noon and nighty-night! - Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! - But I could still bounce with ya, right, Tigger? Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! My very own tigger family! Oh-ho. You wish to find your family. A most noble quest, indeed. There we are. Help yourself to the cream and sugar. The search for Familius Genus Tiggeris. That is Latin, I believe. Or is it, uh, Greek? Speaking of family, why, my very own family portraits... hang right over there... a collection I've gathered throughout the years. Notice the interesting twists and turns of its many branches... stretching out across the ages. It all comes from having strong roots, you know... and plenty of time to grow. In fact, I do believe that the very seed of my family... began to germinate as far back as the 1 4th century... when a great-great-great grand-uncle of mine... went out on a limb and proclaimed his blossoming love... for a blooming young maid. As their love blossomed, they eventually... were blessed with nine fine young saplings. Never a bough did break-- Now, my dear boy, are you quite all right? Perhaps some more tea. Anyway, if I may go out on a limb here... I would first and foremost suggest for Tigger... that to find one's family, one must first look up... one's family tree. Oh, it does bring to mind a distant nephew of mine. An odd sort of fellow. He became a sailor and fell in with a member... - of the feline persuasion. - My... family tree? My family tree! Why didn't I think of thinkin' of that? So long, beak lips! Thanks for the tip! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo, hoo! I say. Was it something I said? And so began Tigger's grand search... for his family tree. He searched high. He searched low. He searched near... and he searched far. Yoo-hoo! Family! Family! Hello! But Tigger, how are you gonna know... which tree is your family tree? Why, that's obvious, Roo boy. My tigger family tree has got to be the biggest... hugest and most gigantical tree in the entire Hundred Acre Woodses... on account of all the enormous numerical numerous numbers of... tigger family members that'll be on it. And besides and furthermore, it'll be all stripedy... just like yours truly. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! The only question is... where could my family tree be? There! Good as new. Or maybe even better, if I do say so myself. Could be a bit drafty. Might leak some. Sort of lopsided. Kind of cramped. Otherwise, a dream house. Hiya, donkey boy! Hiya, donkey boy! - Tigger. - Tigger! - Tigger? Back to his bouncy old self. Oh, is this perhaps a tigger family tree up there? Were you asking us to bounce with you? Because, you see, we would be glad to-- Hello, tigger family! Hello! - Uh, no, not this one. Hello! - Hello! - Other tiggers, come out, come out, wherever you are! - Other tiggers! - Come out, come out, wherever you are! - And aren't! Et cetera! - Hello! Tigger's family! - Hello! Tigger's family! - Where are you? - Pooh bear? I didn't know Tigger had a family. Yes. Only it appears... that he has lost them. Seemed to be lookin' for 'em. Uh, was that something we were supposed to be doing too? Why, I believe it must be, Piglet. I quite often remember to forget these sorts of things. Oh, no, no. Aren't you coming, Rabbit? Huh? To look for more tiggers? As if one wasn't bad enough. No, no! No! I have too many winter preparations to make. And-- And if you three had any sense, you'd be doing the same. Come on. - Hello! Hello! - Hello! - Tiggers! Come out, come out, wherever you aren't! - Tiggers! - Hello! Tiggers! -Just where aren't those tiggers anyway? We looked every which and where... not to mention right over there... and not a single stripedy tree in sight. Maybe I've been going about this all the wrong way upside down. Maybe what I need to do is find some sort of clue... as to where are their whereabouts. What kind of clue? Maybe in here. Some thingamabob or an heir-i-loom or something. Oh! Maybe this belonged to my uncle! Whatever. And just think... if there are other tiggers, we could all bounce... the Whoop-de-Dooper, Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce! 'Cause it's the bounce that tiggers do best. The Whoop-de-w-- What kind of bounce? Oh, you know, that bounce I bounc-ed when I bounced that big rock... the most hardest bounce of them all that only the very bestest bouncers can bounce. - You know. - Only the very bestest bouncers... can bounce it. Oh! Could my auntie have made this for me? I could bounce it. It looks like she made a pair. If you could teach me the Whoopy Super-Duper Bounce, then I could-- Teach ya the W-D-double-L-A-O-B? What? That's ridickerous! Why, it-- it's a-- It's a very powerful bounce, and it's only... for professional bouncers. But I'm a real good bouncer. Hoo, hoo, hoo. No offence there, Roo boy... but I think you're a little on the smallish side of tiny... and kinda lackin' in perpendicaler. I-l could do the Whooper Dooper, uh-- The Looper Dooper, uh-- If you teach me. Oh, you can't bounce the bounce... if you can't even pronounce the bounce. Repeat after Tigger. The Whoop-de-Dooper Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce The Whoop-de-Dooper Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce It's got the zip that makes you flip and that's what really counts In the Whoop-de-Dooper Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce Now, half this bounce is 90 percent mental. If you calculate the specific tiggerjectory... of your stripecelleration dicipherus... by the square boot of your rebounce, your vertical situituation indicator... and your stripersonic springnertia should ric-a-ticochet... your hydranific fu-silly-age... into an accelerometric de-orbit! - Any questions? - When do I get to learn the Whooping Looper Whooper-- I mean, the Looper Dooper Whooper, uh-- The Whoop-de-Dooper Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce The Whoop-de-Dooper Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce The more you try, the more you fly and that's what really counts In the Whoop-de-Dooper Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce Now, you swing your legs up high, and you twist your tail in tight. Wind up all your springs... and with your eyes situated straight ahead... you let it all loose. Um, is this right? It's best when done by tiggers 'cause ourtiggerific figgers Are filled with vim sand vigours and that's the thing that triggers The Whoop-de-Dooper Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce The Whoop-de-Dooper Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce - The more you try, the more you fly and that's what really counts - Right. It activates, it elevates accelerates and more - Whee! - You're bouncing off the ceiling like you never did before - The Whoop-de-Dooper - Whoop-de-Dooper - Loop-de-Looper - Loop-de-Looper Ali-Ooper Bounce Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Wow! Now me! Now me! Tut, tut, tut! Hoo, hoo, hoo. Wait a minute. We haven't gone over all the safety rules and regularations. - Aw! - Rule number one: Always bounce in a well-lit area. Rule number the-next-one: Never bounce near an open flame. Rule three: Never bounce right after eatin', or you'll get tail cramps. - First you-- And then you-- - Rule number four: Do not forget rule number-- And then you let it all loose with a-- Rule number-- Whoo! Whoa! I think you let it a little too loose. Maybe another lesson? I could-- What is this doohickey? Why, that's no doohickey. It's a thingamabob. Been in the family for generations. And I never even knew I had a doo-- Hoo, hoo, hoo! This is the exact thingamabob I was lookin' for. And it must have a picture... of my tigger family inside it. - Oh, boy! - Oh! I can't wait. I'll bet I got my mother's eyes... and my father's tail and-and-- one of my sister's chins, of course. My grand pappy's stripes. It's kind of, sort of-- Empty. Completely tiggerless. How am I supposed to find my family now? M-Maybe there's another way to reach 'em. Another way? A letter! Why don't you write 'em a letter? Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! - Hello! - Hello? - Hello out there. Hello! Tigger's family? Tigger's family tree. Hello! Uh, how will we know a tigger family member... when we see one? I suspect that he, or she... would be rather more bouncy than usual, Piglet. I found 'em-- Tigger's family. - Really? - Oh! Where, Eeyore? Here they are, bouncin' like anything, stripes and all. No need to thank me. Do these particular tiggers seem... rather strange to you, Piglet? Y-Y-Yes, and rather f-fierce. Still, I suppose you never can tell with tiggers. Pardon me, Mr-- or Mrs-- Tigger... but could you perhaps accompany me back to Tigger's house? He misses you very much, you see. And he-- Oh, bother. Uh-- Uh, hello, tigger family member. Uh, uh, I was wondering-- That is, i-i-ifyou're not too busy-- Oh! Whoa! D-D-Dear. Sinkin'? Figures. If I could just have a moment? But-But please come back! We really need your help. It would just take a minute. Oh, bother. Nice tigger. Ooh, hoo! I-l don't remember tiggers being quite this s-slippery, do you, Pooh? Well, now that I think of it... I don't remember a tigger making quite that sort of sound either. - Piglet. - Yes, Pooh bear? I don't think these are the right sort of tiggers after all. Not that anyone will miss me. Let me see now. "Dear T-l-double-geh-ers. Tiggers. Greetin's and salivatin's! Please drop by any old time... on account of my house... is your house, and vice-y verse-y. Love, Tigger." Hoo, hoo. There! That oughta do it! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Now there's nothin' to do... but wait. - Hello, Tigger's family. - Hello! - Hello. - Tigger's family? - Are you out there? - Anybody out there? Why, if my tummy is not mistaken... this particular family tree... is a bee sort of family tree. And where there are bees... there's honey. Um, I think there may be something moving... in this tree. D-Do you think it could be... Tigger's family up there, Pooh bear? I suppose there's only one way to find out, Piglet. Just as my tummy suspected. Ow! Bother. If only these bees were a bit less... busy. Perhaps if I hummed a soothing sort of song... Like such: Go to sleep Shh, quiet lf you're a bee A lullaby Lullabee, lullabee Honey bees in the tree Rest your wings Till the morning light Lullabee, lullabee Honey bees in the tree Your honey Is safe tonight Just dream to the tune I 'am singing Time to stop All that buzzing and Stinging Mm, ouch. Lullabee, lullabee Honey bees in the tree All I want is a smackrel Or two Or three Don't sleep lightly Sleep very tightly Happy slumbers To you Shh. Pooh bear's been up in that tree an awful long time, don't you think? Most likely he's stuck. Been known to happen. Oh, d-dear! Then l-- I'd better climb up and-and see if he's all right. Uh, Pooh bear. - Uh, a-a-are you stuck? - Oh! Oh, bother. Uh, Pooh bear? - Oh! Piglet. - Yes, Pooh? - I have come to the conclusion that-- - Whoa! that these bees are definitely not the right sort of tiggers! It doesn't look good. Bees! Run! At last, the day had come to an end... as days often will. And what had begun as a very exciting idea... had changed to a rather discouraging one. Tigger? Uh, I gotta go home now. Mama will be worried about me. Tigger? Oh, what, am I kiddin' myself? They're not comin'... 'cause I might as well face it-- there aren't any other tiggers. I guess that means this silly old thing's... just gonna stay empty for... all of forever. But isn't that the wonderful thing about tiggers... being the only one? You betcha, Roo boy. Oh, the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm The very only Last, lonely, single... s-s-s-solitary... one. First, l-- And just so-- And then l-- Like this. And then a little twist, like such. And then I let it all loose with a-- Oh! Whatever are you doing, Roo, dear? I'm practising the Whoop-de-Doop-Tee Bounce. Maybe if I do it really good for Tigger... he wouldn't miss not having a family so much. But I can't bounce it yet. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to do it in time, dear. But Tigger seems awful lonely, don't you think, Mama? I suppose he might be every now and again. - Mama? - Yes, dear? I wish I had a big brother like Tigger. Now, why wish that... when you have a Tigger like Tigger? 'Cause then I'd be his little brother... and he'd be just like one of our family. - Wouldn't that be great? - But, Roo, dear... Tigger is one of our family. And as long as we care for him, he always will be. Sweet dreams, Roo, dear. I still wish I could do something to make him feel better. I say, young Roo, if you suggest that a letter... would bring cheer to our friend Tigger... then we shall, by all means, write one! Now, uh, what sort of letter is this to be? It's by us from them to him. By which from what to whom? From Tigger's family to Tigger. Ah, yes! "Dear Tigger, Just a note to say--" Uh, "just a note to say"? What shall it say? Well, uh... I suppose it might say... um, "dress warmly"? Oh, oh, I see. Excellent advice. Oh, Owl? Perhaps-- "Eat well"? Good point, Pooh bear. "Stay safe and sound"? Oh, a very good idea, Piglet. "Keep smilin'." "We're always there for you." "Wishing you all the best. Signed, Your Family." - There. - Won't Tigger be pleased? - Yes, yes, how wonderful for Tigger. - What a splendid idea. - Nice, everybody. - Yes, marvellous work, everyone. And so, the next morning-- Hello, everybody! Pooh boy! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Pigilet! Kanga! Kanga! Roo! Roo! Roo! Hoo, hoo, hoo! Eeyore! Eeyore, old buddy! Look at what I got. A letter, a letter for me! That's who. Hoo, hoo, hoo! T-l-double-geh-er spells Tigger! I, uh, wonder who it might be from. From my very own family! I knew I had one. A great big family! Full of uncles and aunties... and-and grand-tiggers and second-cousin tiggers! And they're all just like me. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Just imaginate it. Hundreds of thousands of tiggers! All bouncin' around up there in our huge gigantical family tree! There's momsey tiggers and popsey tiggers And tiggers In ever knew Like sister tiggers and brother tiggers And cousin tiggers too There's grandma tiggers and grandpa tiggers as you can plainly see When we're all together it's ajumpin 'jamboree 'Round, 'round my family tree I look like them and they look like me 'Round, 'round my family tree We're a happy family There's huge slews of nephew tiggers Uncle tiggers by the ton There's whippersnappin 'grandpappy tiggers and grandma tiggers are fun There's skinny, little tiny little thin, little tiggers Roly-poly tiggers too But we're all relations and we're quite a mighty crew 'Round, 'round my family tree I look like them and they look like me - 'Round, 'round my family tree We're a happy family - The Amazing Flying Tiggers! 'Round my family tree We're a happy family The firstest-most roots of my family tree Reach way backin history To the braverest, fiercerest noblerest tiggers You'd ever care to see The heroicest figgers of my ancestor tiggers Has always been hailed and cheered And the sculpturous grace of our tiggerous faces Is why we're all revered There were warrior tiggers Explorier tiggers And tiggers of worldly acclaim There were glorious fantazmagorious tiggers With prizes and fortunes and fame There's the glamorous branch and the amorous branch Of our fabulous family tree And when we sing together We're in perfect harmony 'Round and 'round my family tree I look like them and they look like me 'Round and 'round my family tree We're a happy family Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. There's momsey tiggers and popsey tiggers And tiggers In ever knew Hoo, hoo. Like uncle tiggers and nephewtiggers And grandma tiggers too And when we tiggers all get together We really have a ball The bounciest, trounciest flounciest, pounciest Most tiggerifigest Family reunion of all Everybody bounce! You know how to do it! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. And-- I'm especially excited about this part-- they miss me somethin' awful! And they're comin' to see me tomorrow! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! T-T-Tomorrow? - Uh-oh. - Oh, Tigger, I can't wait to meet them. Now, w-w-w-where did it say that exactly? Exackatackly nowhere, per se... 'cause with us tiggers, you got to read betwixt the lines. I'm gonna see my whole family! 'Cause my whole family is all comin' to see... Little old you-know-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm not the only one I'm not the only one Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Now, Tigger was so enormously excited... that his friends couldn't help but feel, well, a bit concerned. Tigger? Tigger? - Tigger? - Oh, hiya, Roo. What are ya doin', Tigger? Why, I'm buildin' a family room on to my house! So my family will have plenty of room! They got to live somewheres after the big family reunitin' party. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! - Party? - Why, sure! Boy, it's gonna be great. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! It's all right in my letter. Speakin' of which, you wanna hear me read it once or thrice again? - Uh, Tigger-- - "Dear--" They call me "dear." It's embarrassin', ain't it, the way us tiggers go oozin' oodles and doodles of affection? - Yeah, but-- - "Dear Tigger--" Ya see that? Us tiggers always call us tiggers by their firstest names. "Dress warmly." They're worried sick about me. "Eat well. Keep smilin'. Stay safe and sound." And here is the best part of all. "We're always there forya." Isn't this the all-time greatest? Yeah, the greatest. I was gonna tell him, but I couldn't. Pooh, do you think you could? Why, certainly, Roo. Could what? Tell him, uh, about the letter? Why, certainly. Could that be them already? Tiggers are usually fashion bubbly late. Welcome, dear brothers, to the house of Tigger! Oh. Hiya, buddy bear. You're just in time to help me finish up with the finishin' up. - Hold these here while I put those there. - Uh, Tigger... there is a very important matter which I must discuss. You're right, Pooh boy! I could use another balloon or two dozen. Um, Tigger? Hmm. Something isn't right here. Much better. Now, what'd you want to talk about, Pooh boy? Pooh? Perhaps I'll need a bit of help. Tigger was so very excited... and had so very many things to do... he heard very little of what anyone else was saying. But as it so happened... none of his friends had the heart to tell Tigger... very much of anything anyway. Not like he won't find out for himself... sooner or later. Oh, poor dear. He'll be so disappointed. - Oh, d-d-dear. - Indeed. Oh, what have we done? Oh, perhaps his family will come... and everything will be fine. That's it! There! A veritable work of art. Ah. And just how will this cheer up Tigger? Uh, well, uh, the stripes look okay. But what we have to do is act real tiggery. We gotta do a lot of bouncing... and say a lot of tigger stuff. Yes, such as, "Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!" "Absoposilutely." That's kinda sorta like-- Like Tigger, but, um-- How to be a tigger How to be a tigger How to be a tigger is up to you Ah! You've got to look like a tigger -And-And sound like a tigger -And act like a tigger too If we paint black stripes on our underwear And glue on whiskers too We're bound to appear far more as tiggers do Ha, ha. Unquestionably. Maybe we could all say T. T.F.N. and shout hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo We all might sound a lot more tiggerish too You think? And that is how to be a tigger How to be a tigger How to be a tigger is up to you You've got to look like a tigger and sound like a tigger And act like a tigger too If we break things up and knock things down And leave the place a mess That's the thing that Tigger does the best I oughta know. And if I don't eat honey from the honey pot Ol' Tigger will plainly see I must be another tigger because I couldn't possibly be me And that is how to be a tigger How to be a tigger How to be a tigger is up to you You've got to look like a tigger and sound like a tigger And act like a tigger-- Um, also. Oh! Thank goodness I found you all here. There's a terrible storm headed for-- What on earth are you doing? Stripes? Springs? Have you lost your minds? You should be covering the windows! Counting your supplies! Gathering firewood! Winter is here, and-and you aren't even ready. What are you doing wasting your time with-- What am I doing wasting my time? I've got serious work to do! At least I haven't lost sight of what's really important. Well, l-l-l really didn't have enough time... to gather any firewood. I am down to this... Last lonely honey pot. Well, come to think of it, uh... we don't really look or act very much like tiggers. Thought I was pretty convincing. Wait! Wait! We gotta do it! We have to do it! Think how sad Tigger's gonna feel. Oh, but we don't really know how to be a tigger. Yeah, we do. Um-- If we could all be happy Full of friendliness and cheer He'll surely see we are his family Ah! We're filled with joy and laughter And the happiness he starts Candlelit from the bottom Of our hearts And that is how to be a tigger How to be a tigger How to be a tigger is up to you you've got to be like a tigger -Full of glee like a tigger with a happy -Hoo, hoo, hoo - How to be a tigger - How to be a tigger How to be a tigger is up to you You've got to be like a tigger full of glee like a tigger With a happy hoo, hoo, hoo Hoo, hoo I wonder where they could be. What if they got the wrong directions? What if they strayed off the beaten path? What if they're out there hopelessly lost? Clutched in the cruel grasp of winter? Hold on, tiggers! I'm comin' to get ya! Surprise! Is it-- Is it-- Is it really you... my very own one and only family? - Yep, yep! - Come in, come in! There's a lot of catching' uppin' we gotta do. We haven't seen each other in-- We haven't seen each other! Ooh! Ooh. Um, gee, it's, um, nice... to have all us tiggers gettin' together like this. - Huh? - Oh, yes, yes. - Yes. - Sure. - It certainly is. What am l-- Where the heck are my mannerisms? Uh, uh, r-r-refreshin' refreshyments for all. Hoo, hoo. Comin' right up. Hoo, hoo. Help yourself. Don't be-- Don't be shy. There you go. Take two, you're small. I mean, they're small. - I mean, oh, here, have another. A lot of vitamins and minimals after all. - Bother. Oh, um, my, what-- what-- what a nice home you have. Yes, and what lovely decorations. So bouncety and, uh, stripedy. - Nice weather. - Party flavour? Now this party's really startin' to pick up. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! - So, what you been up to, cousin? - I-l-l-- I've been, uh-- Bouncin'! Bouncin', bouncin', mornin' and noon, and noon to night. Why, that's what I've been doin' too! It must run in the family. Hey, who's up for some family-type fun and games? You look like a fun-lovin' type offella. I got a great party-type, family-type game we can play. How about pin the tail on the do-- It looks like you already been playin' it. - Whew! - I know. Let's all do what tiggers do best. That would be bouncin', of course. - Oh, yes, what a lovely idea. - Oh, of course, bouncin' again. - Yeah! - Let the bouncin' begin! Yeah! Bounce. Bounce. Oops. I do enjoy bouncing. - Bounce, bounce. - Don't bounce too high now, Roo. Tigger. Tigger, dear. You certainly have a wonderful family, Tigger. Wait a second! We gotta bounce the Whoop-de-Dooper... Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce! What a tiggerific idea! Guests first. You gotta swing your legs up high. And you twist your tail in tight. You wind up all your springs... and with your eyes, fix them straight ahead... you let it all loose and go... "Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!" Roo! What are you doin' impersonizin' a tigger? Piglet? Kanga. Owl. - Eeyore! - Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. We only wanted to help, Tigger. Oh. Oh. Now I understand. It was all a big joke. Well, that's all right... 'cause somewhere out there... there's a tigger family tree full of my real tigger family. I've got a letter to prove it. And I'm gonna find 'em, so... T.T.F.E. Ta-ta forever! Poor Tigger, all alone in the cold. He must be very sad... and perhaps lost. And maybe even a bit... hungry. Bother. Pooh, you gotta help me find Tigger. It's all my fault. He never would have left if it wasn't 'cause of me. I didn't mean to make him feel bad. I just-- I-l just wanted him to-- to be my big brother. Oh. Oh. We gotta go find him. We just gotta. And so we will. What we need is-- think, think, think-- an exposition. - An expotition? - Yes. To the place where Tigger is. Or was. Or will be? I believe Rabbit should lead us. - Rabbit? - Oh, yes. He's the only one who ever says he knows what he's doing. Absolutely not. I mean, uh-- Well, after all, he, uh-- I-It was not, uh, my-- he, um-- He wanted to leave, uh, didn't he? But, Rabbit-- He could always give that extra little push... when you needed it. Oh, thank you, Roo. I-It was n-nice to have him here when things were fr-frightful. Sort of lit up the room when he came in. Uh, well, uh-- Y-- Well-- What do you need, uh, me for? Why don't you, uh, go find him yourselves? But we're just not clever enough, Rabbit. Rabbit. I miss him. Well, l, uh, oh-- Oh, very well. - Tigger. - Tigger! - Tigger! - Tigger. Now, now, uh, careful, everyone. It's a bit windy! Are you all right, Eeyore? Eeyore? Oh! Oh, d-d-dear! - Help! Ooh! - Uh, we must take care... to stick together. Perhaps not this stuck, Piglet. P-P-P-Pardon me, P-Pooh. - Tigger! - Tigger! - Tigger! - Tigger! - Tigger! - Where are ya? - Tigger! Tiggers! Tiggers! Where are you, tiggerseses? I-- I hope they're all okay. Tiggers! Tiggers! Whoa! Whoa! The biggest, hugest... and most gigantical, stripedy tree... in all the entire Hundred Acre Woodses! Is it-- Is it-- My family tree! My family tree! I found it. I found it. I can't believe it! Hello! Hello up there! Where are you, tiggers? It's me, Tigger! Hello! Hello, family! I got your letter, and-- and I came to see ya! Hello! Hello? Hello? Maybe they forgot I was comin'. But...

What are you guyses doin' here? "Doing"? What are we doing here? We came all this way to look for you. Now-- Now forget about all this "other tiggers" nonsense... and, uh, come home. Nonsense? No! No! No! No! No! No! Are you, uh-- Are you crazy? - It's not safe out here. - Exactakly! That's why you should all go home where it is safe. But I've gotta wait here in my family tree... for my real family! Family! Family! Family! - Family! - Is that a rumbly in your tumbly, Pooh? I don't think so, Piglet. Come on, hurry up. No time for dawdling. Not a second to waste. Watch yourself there, Roo boy. Take care, Pooh bear! Don't be scared, Piglet. Up ya go, donkey boy! Help! Oh, no, no! Tigger! Oh, no! Oh! The Whoop-de-Dooper, Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce. The more you try, the more you fly. And that's what really counts! Tigger! Tigger! Wake up, Tigger! Wake up! Tigger? - Yes! - We're alive! - You saved him, Roo. - That was just wonderful, Roo. - Oh, Roo, that was very brave. - Hooray. What a Whoop-de-Doopin', Loop-de-Loopin' Ali-Oopin' Bounce that was! It was, wasn't it? I mean, I really did it, didn't l? Did ya? Come here, you. Why, that bounce was just as good as any old tigger fa-- Tigger... family member. Tigger? Please don't go. There they are. We found them. We found them. - There's Tigger! - Roo! Oh, Roo. - Mama! Mama! - We've been searching all over for you. - How wonderful. Oh, Roo, dear, I was so worried. I'm sorry, Mama. - I'm all right. - Oh, my little Roo. Pooh bear! - Pooh bear! - Christopher Robin. Pooh bear! Pooh! There you are. - Silly old bear. - Oh, my! - Nice to see ya. - Where have you all been? We were looking for Tigger looking for Tigger's family. Tigger's family? You didn't have to go looking for them. But-- But I got a letter, and-- and it said that-- that-- It was right-- Oh. I must have lost it in the avalanchee. I can't even remember the words. Dear Tigger, just a note to say-- Dress warmly. - Eat well. - Stay safe and sound. Keep smilin'. We're always there for you. - Signed-- - Your family. You mean you fell as are my family? I'm afraid we have nothing better to offer. Well, of course not, Pooh boy... 'cause there's nothin' better than the best! I should have seen it all along. Spotted you a mile away. Then the whole mountain came down on top of us. - But Tigger saved us! - I wasn't worried at all... except for the part where I was worried, of course. Ahem, ahoom and et cetera. In honour of this most occasional occasion... my firs test ever family reunitin'... I'd like to present each ofya with a present! Firs test, for Eeyore! A new family room for your lovely home. Seems kind of big. Bit on the comfy side. Not very drafty. But I suppose I'll get used to it. I love parties so much. And for Pooh boy, enough honey to last all winter. Or till next Thursday anyways. Why, thank you, Tigger. It looks good enough to eat. And for Piglet, old pal, a winter's worth of firewood. - Keep warm. - Oh, thank you, Tigger! Well, you're very welcome. I think I'll eat a piece myself. And for you, long ears, I promise from now on... I'll always watch where I'm bouncin'. Oh, well, thank you, uh, uh, Tigger. Bravo, Tigger! Bravo, I say. Very well done indeed. - I'm very impressed. - Thank you so much! - Thank you, Tigger. - Thank you so much, Tigger. - Oh, look at this. - Whoa! You didn't think I was gonna disremember you, did ya? Go on. Go on. Open her up. It's all yours. Is it really for me, Tigger? Only the best for my bestest little brother. Wait halfa minute. We still need a family portrait to put in it. Look this way, everybody. Closer. Smile. Sunny days and starry nights And lazy afternoons You're countin 'castles in the clouds And hummin' little tunes But somehow right before your eyes The summer fades away Everything is different And everything has changed If you feel lost And on your own And far from home You're never alone, you know Just think of your friends The ones who care They all will be waitin' there With love to share And your heart will lead you Home Funny how photograph Can take you backin time To places and embraces That you thought you'd left behind They're tryin' to remind you That you're not the only one That no one is an island When all is said and done If you feel lost And on your own And far from home You're never alone, you know Just think of your friends The ones who care They all will be waitin' there With love to share And your heart will lead you Home There'll come a day When you're losin' your way And you won't know where You belong They say that home is where the heart is So follow your heart And know that you can't go wrong If you feel lost And on your own And far from home You're never alone, you know Just think of your friends The ones who care They all will be waitin' there With love to share And your heart will lead you - If you feel lost - Lost and on your own And far from home You're never alone, you know Just think of your friends The ones who care They all will be waitin' there With love to share And your heart will lead you Where you belong I know your heart Will lead you Home
