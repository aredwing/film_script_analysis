If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there, Your Hand will guide me. There is no place you can go, no place you can be, where you are not in the presence of the Lord our God. There is no thought you can have, no dream you can dream, where the Lord our God does not see. If I go up to the heavens, You are there. If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there, Your hand will guide me. If I make my bed in the depths, You are there. Dorothy? We're back. Dorothy? Naughty baby won't drink its milk! Jesus! Shh. Shh. - No, please! - Calm down. You see what I mean? Absolutely normal. Can I have a cigarette? Things are still very... confused. There's no rush. You take all the time you want. Where should I begin? You wanted this case. You knew how difficult it would be. But you still wanted it. You insisted. I wanted to go. I needed to. I had to get away before the city smothered me. They're riding our backside! Hurry up! Hurry up! Faster! Go! Step on it! Step on it! Come on, lads. The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. Look over there! You all right, miss? You're okay? I wasn't speeding. There were two cars racing each other. Racing each other? An orange and a blue one. It's hardly a diving watch you've got there. Let it dry. It'll tick again in a day or two. Well, we can't sit around here all night. Wait. There's a back entrance. The psychiatrist. - Gloria. - Did you have a bit of an accident, huh? All right, Colin? You come with me. We'll get you dried off. Here it is. Isn't a suite, but I hope you'll be comfortable. I'll maybe get you another blanket. It's been cold these last few nights. The heating's been on all day, so there should be plenty of hot water. This is the bathroom. Should I run a bath for you? I'll bring you up another towel. Don't take any notice of the menfolk. They're decent enough men at heart. Be back up in a few minutes. Bring you up a bit of supper. There you are. Did you sleep well? Not with an electric guitar playing over my head all night. That's funny. There's no one here but ourselves. You were maybe dreaming. It's a lovely day. I'll get you some white pudding. It's delicious. You'll love it. How long will it take to fix this? It's scrap. Even if we could get the parts, it would cost more than the car's worth. Can I rent a car? I've only got that pickup over there. - Is it safe? - How safe was your BMW? I'll get you the keys. You must understand that I'm here as much as for your sake as for Dorothy's. You're already making excuses for her? I'm trying to find out the truth. The truth? The truth is... you'll find some name for her condition, and in another couple of years, she'll be out there abusing someone else's child, maybe even her own. Can you tell me what happened that night? That was the first time we used Dorothy as a babysitter. I had my doubts, but the pastor said she was all right. Dorothy? We're back. Dorothy? Naughty baby won't drink its milk! Jesus! He's my baby. He's my baby. He's my baby! - Get away from him! - He's my baby! Hello, shit face! What have you done? What have you done? What have you done! Come on. Come on! Pastor, you gotta let us on to the mainland. It's an emergency. Please! In this case, we'll make an exception. Well, I'll call for assistance. They'll send a helicopter. She's a fuckin' nutcase. Ask Paul Fallon's son Jake what he thinks of her. Hello, Dorothy. I'm Dr. Morton, but you can call me Jane. You were expecting me, weren't you? You're very gifted. Dorothy, we need to talk. Can I sit here? You know why I'm here, don't you? Look, all I want is to listen to you. I'm not here to judge you, and I won't make any decisions. Do you like babies? What baby? There was no baby. I wasn't even there. I don't want to speak anymore. Nobody listens to me. Nobody. I'm listening. And I'll understand you. Dorothy. Trust me. So where were you if you weren't at the Kearsleys'? I said my prayers, and I went to bed. And I woke up in the morning in my bed. Do you remember anything else? I'm sick of all your questions. Okay. Well, why don't we just swap places, then? You ask me questions. I can ask you questions? You think she's guilty, don't you? I'm just doing the first psychological assessment in this case. Case? This case is a child. And she has suffered enough. It's up to the court to decide what happens. I promise I'll do what's best for her. "Curiosity. Sin or flaw?" That's enough now! Write that out 100 times and show me in the morning. Now go! So you're the doctor, too? I am. How long have you been looking after Dorothy? Not since she was 13. Healthy child, isn't she? Here on the island, we live a clean, healthy life. Our faith shelters us. I suppose you just failed to notice her mental illness? Dorothy is a special child. There is a place for her in our community. Even if she did molest that baby? It is the Lord's place to judge, not mine. I'm not here to judge her, either. I'm here to help her. And she can be helped. We have little faith in your science. How can your science fathom her pure soul? One of God's angels. An angel that might end up in prison. They're not really fond of women in here, are they? It's a very devout community. They take their faith very seriously. You're not a believer? Me? No. Jeez. Had enough of that when I was a kid. You were born here? Hmm. And raised. Tried to escape the place, but this island is like a magnet. You can't escape. There you are. What is it with white food and this island? Hey, you've only three days of it. I have to live here. I saw Dorothy today. Yeah? How'd it go? I think she's scared to death. - Scared of who? - Don't know. Herself, maybe. Self-loathing can be a powerful driver. Don't stare at her too long there, John. You know what these shrinks are like. Wouldn't want her to know we're thinking about fucking her. Jesus. Dear Lord... ...once again we ask You to shower Your blessings upon us. Give unto Your servant Dorothy the warmth of Your divine light. Let her find the way through the halls of darkness. Talk to me. I know you're there, my son. Say hello to your mother, son. Happy Birthday, son. Perhaps this is not the time. I'm sorry, mate. Hello! Janey! What's up, lying shrink? Hope we're not wakin' you up, eh! We don't need you! Go back to where you belong! Would you calm down, John? Come on, lad. They're only kids. - Christ Almighty! - Jesus. They're just kids, John. - It's just kids messing about. - Let go of me. I'll fucking kill them. They were underneath my window, waiting for me. Look, I can see you're upset. But I know everybody on this island. There aren't any teenagers that fit that description. Or orange cars, for that matter. You think I'm imagining this? No, but... Look, if it helps, I'll stick around for the next couple of days, okay? You're leaving Sunday, right? That's my son. Lives with his mother on the mainland. Do you have any kids? A little boy. Yeah? He died. I'm sorry. It's okay. Um, I'd better go. Thanks for the drink. When my sister died, there was no one else to look after her. So it was natural she stay with me. What about Dorothy's father? We never knew him. Mabel wasn't promiscuous, you understand? She was fanciful, flighty. She wasn't simple, either, no matter what the others say. She just couldn't seem to hold down a job until she took the job in the funeral parlor, laying out the dead. She liked that. But she was a good mother. And she kept Dorothy safe from the other children. Do you have any idea why she was bullied by the other children? Because they hated anyone or anything that was different. God help the child. She was always different. Did you ever think she might be dangerous? She never laid a hand on that baby. She swore to me she didn't, and I believe her. Why do you want to help me? Because I've heard you talk and... I don't think you're here to help me. I am here to help you. I think I can help you, Dorothy. You know why? Because it's my gift. You're good at painting, and I'm good at listening and understanding. I can see why you like this place. It's beautiful. My mother used to bring me here when I was little. We had this game where we pretended to fly. I always wanted to fly. Suppose you could fly. Where would you go? Nowhere. I'd just fly. I'd never land. I'd fly as far as I could until my last breath... and then fall. And everything would be over. Don't be shy, boy. Hey. Hey, Paul, that son of yours won't take a drink. Go on, Jakey. The Pastor's not here. You're a man now, Jakey. Uhh... The love of the Lord Jesus is as the ocean, vast and endless. We see it lap upon our shore. But know that it laps on every shore. The Lord sees all and knows all... the righteous and the sinner, the guilty and the blameless. Morning. We had an appointment. Do you remember? I'm sorry. I had to take Dorothy to the police station to sign the register. She's ready for you now. Hi, Dorothy. Do you want to come for a walk with me? I'll take you back to your aunt afterwards. I want to stay with my auntie. Come on, child. Come out. Do as you're told, child. That's a girl. Your aunt is really nice with you, isn't she? Yes, she is. She's looking after me until Mommy comes back. Where is your mommy? She's out on the sea, sailing. She'll soon be back to pick up her little Mimi and give her a pretty dress. M-Mimi? How old are you? Ain't she gorgeous? So if you are Mimi, where has Dorothy gone? She hasn't gone. She's asleep. Asleep? Yes. In here. Right inside. Dorothy is asleep inside of you? You know what? When her mother died, I had to go to the funeral because Dorothy was sleeping. They don't let her out much. Who doesn't let her out? The others. Who are they? I'm not allowed to tell. Why don't they let her out? Because she always tries to kill herself. Do you think my hair is pretty? Do you like it? It's a gift. You can keep it on. Oh, thank you! Tear that bitch's dress! Tear that bitch's dress! Dorothy! Trash it to ribbons! - Mimi! - Shut your mouth, you little bitch! Aah! Bitch! Who are you? Talk to me. Fuck off! Ugh! Fuck off, slag! I'll kick your fuckin'... Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy, where are you? Mommy, help me. Help me. Shh. Shh. It's over. I'm here with you, baby. How dare you! You should be ashamed of yourself. Come on, pet. I would appreciate it if you didn't interfere during the sessions. Come on, darlin'. Go on now. Good girl. Hello? Tom? It's me, Jane. Yeah. Great. Well, it's a very interesting case. I think I just might have to stay... Hello? Hello? Shit. Badger! Oh. You scared me. Sorry. It's difficult to call the mainland from the island. You going back to the village? I am now, I suppose. Your fags are crap. Haven't you got anything stronger? - Dorothy? - Uh-uh. Wrong answer. Want to try again? Well, I see Dorothy. But you're listening to Mary. Fuckin' weird, huh? So where's Mimi? Little bitch couldn't keep her mouth shut. And what about Dorothy? Moaning or praying somewhere in here. She's only good for one thing... taking the hangover after I get drunk. Is that what happened, Mary? You hurt the baby and let Dorothy face the consequences? I didn't lay a finger on that brat! But if she goes to jail for it, there's no more drinking for you. You better take care, shrink! You're a stranger here. Stick your nose in too far, and you might lose it. Trust me. You don't want that. Who said you could feel me tits? Why are we going to this shitty party anyway? Because I want to dance. Fuck you. And you know how well I can dance. Hey. - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo-hoo! Jesus. The bastards. The bastards! Christ. I'm gonna make them pay for this. By Christ I am. Come on, lads. Come on. Come on. Mrs. Fallon. Mrs. Fallon, I'm Jane Morton. - I'm here to... - I know who you are. I need to speak to your son Jake. You want to ask him about that bitch Dorothy Mills? She's a liar. A slut and a liar. Why do you call her a slut? What's the problem? What do you want? Come to gloat? - Paul, calm down. - Shut up! You're getting a real kick out of this, aren't you? Messin' us around like guinea pigs. Well, let me tell you something. This island is no fucking laboratory, Doctor. Come on, now, Paul. Drop it. - All right, come on. - You fucking bird. Go on. What the fuck is wrong with you people? Just go. Get a grip on yourself, boy. We didn't do anything wrong. Not us. We've nothing to be guilty about. No, sir. Does nothing work on this bloody island? - We'll see what we can do tomorrow. - Tomorrow? It's the Lord's day today. Go and see in the church. She let the devil into her house. Our Father... - Our King of glory... - Our King of glories... - We ask the Lord Jesus... - We ask the Lord Jesus... To bear your servant Dorothy... To bear your servant Dorothy... Once more into the realm of the dead. Once more into the realm of the dead. Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ, - our Father, our King... - I beg you. Please let him talk to me. Please let him find the peace to talk. Leave her alone! Through the blackness of eternity... Fuck all of you pigs! Please stop! It hurts! Let her go before I fucking kill you! Please don't! Leave her alone! For God's sake. Please don't. Please. I shall notify the court in the morning that Dorothy must be taken into custody immediately. She's not safe with you. I'm taking her with me. Aah! You bitch! Bitch! All right, Dorothy, calm down. Oh, hey, it's the fucking sheriff! I asked you not to intervene. Well, next time, I'll tie her up. My head. Well, you were kind of asking for it. Dorothy? I'm not Dorothy. I'm Kurt. Well, nice to meet you, Kurt. I'm Jane. Tell me what I can do to help you. I always take the pain for her. For Dorothy. I take the pain so she doesn't get hurt. She wouldn't handle it. That's very brave of you. Yeah, well, I'm getting a bit bored with it now. And I don't want to go to jail. If Dorothy goes to jail, we'll all go, won't we? Yes. But you have to help me. Were you there at the Kearsleys'? - Did you see the baby? - No, no. I can't talk. Duncan won't let me. - Who's Duncan? - Duncan's the boss. Where is he? Can I talk to him? Trust me, you don't want anything to do with him. You, especially. He'd kill you. Tell Duncan that I want to speak to... Come back here, bastard! Bastard! Shut it! Hold her down for me. Dorothy. No. I killed the baby, didn't I? Tell me. Tell me, please. - Dorothy? - What are you doing? No. - I promise... - Stop it. - I promise it won't hurt. - Stop it! We should take her home. I gave her a tranquilizer. She'll sleep until tomorrow morning. I'll be here before she wakes up. You were very impressive back there. Thanks. But you should've got that ferry this morning. You know, people are getting nervous around here. You're unsettling them. I'm unsettling them? You've had time to gather your material, you know? You can write your report now, can't you? Well, maybe there's more at stake than just a report. Look, I've a small boat. I could easily take you to the mainland. I can't leave without Dorothy. Well, the next ferry isn't for three days. Well, then, I'll just have to wait for it. See you later. Jakey. Hey, gorgeous. Want to party? Dorothy, you shouldn't be out here... Shut up. You drive. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. You really think I was gonna let a pinhead like you jerk off inside me? You're a funny boy, Jakey, aren't you? Can't resist. I'm desperate, but I'm not that desperate. You twisted slut. I'll fucking kill you! You slag! You fucking dirt box! Hello? Dr. Norton? Yes, it's me. Who's speaking? Dorothy tried to kill herself. Who is this? Dorothy needs you. Come quickly. Dorothy! Why, you must be freezing. I'm not Dorothy. I'm Kurt. What happened, Kurt? When you put Dorothy to bed, Mary took over and escaped out the window. What did she do? The usual tricks. She got arsed with some bloke, and then vanished when things got out of hand. Dorothy was so close to throwing herself off that cliff. If I hadn't been there to save her... Good man, Kurt. Dorothy will be very proud of you. Oh, sweetheart, I'm here. It's all right now. I'm taking you home. What sort of drug did you give her? I'm not dead? I'm not dead! No, no, you're not dead. But I saw the cliff. I remember the cliff. I fell off the cliff. I saw the waves. Shh. You're safe now. It's okay. No, but I'm a freak. Nobody can help a freak! You're not a freak, Dorothy, okay? I've done horrible things I don't even remember. I'm so ashamed. I'm so ashamed. Listen, Dorothy. Listen carefully to me. The things that are happening inside of you are not your fault. These blackouts that you have, they're caused by different characters that you've created in your mind. And when you're scared, just like now, your... your mind sends out a character to protect you. But I don't remember anything. No, but it's because... it's because you... - Dorothy. - No. It's because... you disappear when that happens. Dorothy... they're inside of you. No. No. Dorothy, they're trying to keep you - from killing yourself. - It isn't true. Dorothy, it was one of these characters that hurt this baby, Dorothy, not you. You mustn't be afraid of them. Listen, you must try to relate to them. Get your hand off me. Didn't I already tell you to piss off? Duncan, is that you? Did you hurt the baby? Do you think I hurt the baby? - Why did you do it? - How can I do anything? I'm just a character. Why did you do it? Payback. Just a little bit of payback. What could a baby have done against you? You think you're so fucking smart, don't you? You don't know anything. Why don't you take a look at Dorothy's latest drawing? She did it just for you! Isn't that sweet little David, floating and dead like a rotten old fish? Mommy, Mommy, the water is so cold. - Stop it. - I don't want to die. Stop it. Stop it! Don't shout at me, Mommy. I'm drowning. Help me. Help me. Why did you leave me? Don't let me drown. Mommy, help me. Why did you leave me? Don't let me drown. Please, the water is so cold. The water is so cold. I don't want to die. Please forgive me. It was my fault. I thought it was safe. Please forgive me. Who is the boy in this photograph? That's my grandson. He's the boy that drove me into the lake, him and two other kids. Oh, no. It couldn't be him. He's dead this ten years. He was good on the guitar. What was his name? Duncan. How did he die? Such a stupid thing. They crashed their car into the lake. They? Duncan and his two young friends, Mary and Kurt. No, that's impossible. I saw them in the car in front of me. I've seen them in the square. If you don't believe me, check the records. You must have told her about your son. You're the only one I've mentioned it to. And I didn't even tell you how he died. You've obviously been going through too much strain. Look, you're exhausted, and your imagination's beginning to play tricks on you. Tricks? You don't have the slightest idea. These characters inside of her head are dead. They're dead! And these kids that drove me into the lake, they're dead, too. And they're the ones that are turning poor Dorothy into a fucking ventriloquist! One time she's Mimi, then she's Kurt, then she's Duncan, then she's Mary. I've heard them all speak through her, and there's not a fucking thing she can do about it. How can you believe that? You're the psychiatrist, for fuck's sake. Colin, some evil shit is going on. I swear, she feels people's pain. I mean, I even heard my own dead son speak. Jane. Jane, Jane, Jane. Shh. Hush. Jane, you have to get away from here. I'm gonna take you to the mainland tomorrow... - No. - No, listen. I don't like the way people are acting. I don't think you're safe here. What is their real problem with Dorothy? What are they so fucking scared of? It's old stuff, okay? Local stuff. It's like you've lifted a stone and exposed something. I can't believe it's Dorothy. Here. These'll help you get through the night. You can sleep here. I'll wake you first thing in the morning. Trust me. We'll make decisions in the morning. Okay. No! Badger! Colin, you fucking loser! Get them, Colin! Oh. I'm going to take Dorothy back with me to the hospital. With the right treatment there, I'm confident we can help her. It's for her own good, Mrs. McMahon. If I can prove this is a case of multiple personality, there's a good chance she'll be acquitted. You want to keep her gift all to yourself, don't you? I couldn't bear to lose my Mary all over again. We're talking about Dorothy, Mrs. McMahon. Well, my little Mary died 10 years ago. I thought I'd never see her again. But the good Lord brought Dorothy into my home as a gift. She's worked miracles for me. She's made your son speak, hasn't she? David. That's his name, isn't it? Isn't it? We have to think about Dorothy. We have to help her. I'll take good care of her. You've gotta get away from here. I've seen death cast its wings on you. What is it, Dorothy? Is it the water? - And the blood? - I'm scared. I don't want to remember. I'm scared. It's okay. You've gone through it once. And you can live it again through memory. I want to take you back in time, Dorothy. I'll count from 10 to 1. Where are you? There was an accident. My mother is washing the dead people. - How old are you? - I'm 5. - Do you know them? - Yes. Look, Dorothy. Aren't they beautiful now? They've a long journey ahead of them, to the realm of the dead. Shall we say good-bye to them? No... Don't be scared, Dorothy. Look. It's your cousin Mary. Give her a kiss good-bye. - No. - Give her a kiss. No! Dorothy, give her a kiss good-bye. Come on. Shh. It's over now. It's over now. Dorothy. Shh. Shh. You didn't kiss the dead bodies. Your mind created Mimi as a tiny little girl who doesn't have the slightest idea about death. She kissed the dead for you. Yeah. It's all over now. Shh. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. We'll leave tomorrow morning. Shh. Evening, Colin. Remember me? - No... - You weren't so scared when you were with your three mates. No. You're not real. Don't pretend you've forgotten, you fucking piece of shit! You're dead. Mary's dead. You're all dead. We're back. We've been waiting for you. Time for payback... Sheriff. You tell us who's next! It's up to you. There's a man lying dead in the hall. You tell us who's next. Don't you tell us what to do! Quiet, every one of you! Dorothy, tell me what happened. I don't know. I don't know. When I woke up, he was dead. She's got to be stopped. Before she comes after all of us! Can't you see he killed himself? Dorothy's not the problem. It's you! It's all of you! She knows the truth about your community. Dorothy is a lunatic, just like her mother, and you know that. Dorothy's a member of our community. It's our responsibility to deal with her. My name is Duncan McLellan. Oh, Duncan. My dear Duncan... I was a member of your community, too. We're listening, Duncan. I'll show you. Tell us, Duncan. Why did you hurt the Kearsleys' baby? His father had to pay. They all had to pay for what they did to Mary! Yeah! Come on, Mary! Whoo! Get the fuck away! - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo! Whoo! Why don't you give us a dance? Just piss off, would you? Slapper! Duncan? Kurt! Why the fuck are youse hiding from me? Keeping all the booze to yourselves, is it? Lads! Fuck it. - Hey! Come back and dance. - Fuck off! Better watch your language, you slut. Yeah, be polite to me friend. Hey! Let go of me, will you? Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off me! Duncan! Duncan! Leave her alone! Jesus! Let her go! Or I swear I'll kill him! Let her go, lads! Let her go! Back off! Back off! I'll cut his throat. Fucking shag this! I'll fucking kill him for that! This is getting out of hand, lad. He tried to kill you. Are you with us or not? It's okay! It's over now! They're riding our backside! Hurry up! Faster! Speed it up, man! Try the fucking gas! Faster! I can't go faster! Hurry! Just step on it! Step on it! Oh, God. Hurry up! They're gonna kill us! You... You killed my daughter. You killed my daughter! Kurt. My Kurt. We were just young and stupid! We didn't mean... Forgive us, Duncan, please! Duncan! - You bastard. - Get away from me. Stay away! Stay away! Mary McMahon was up for it! Oh... you bunch of hypocrites. You didn't bat an eye when we took her away, did you? Hmm? You all thought she deserved it. Didn't you! We're all in this together. Together. We can keep this on the island. - She's the only evidence. - Dorothy! Please! Please, don't touch her! You leave her alone! Please! - Hush, woman! - Don't touch her! Think about it now. Huh? Do you really want all the publicity? Hmm? Policemen? Journalists? Huh? All poking their noses all around this island? Our island? It'll be the end of your happy little community. Huh? Think about that now. She's the only evidence. You leave her alone! This is a time of tribulation. Fear and anger threaten to drive apart those who have lived in fellowship for many, many years. We cannot let this pass. For the sake of the island, we must act. We must right this wrong. We will not hand you to the police. But you cannot stay here. You will be exiled from this place forever, you and your families. Your homes will be leveled. All memory of you will be erased. If any man should disagree with this, let him speak now. We have all sinned. And we shall all suffer. So let us now devote ourself to the worship of the Lord our God, in the hope of redeeming ourselves in His eyes. As for the psychiatrist, it was her own stubbornness and refusal to listen to reason which brought her to tragedy. Suffice to say she left us without word of her destination. No. No. It's not possible. I'm dead? I'm so sorry, Jane. It's all my fault. I should've stopped you from going on that damned island. I feel so guilty. Don't say that. I'm happy you sent me. I couldn't save David, you see. But at least I saved Dorothy. I saved her, didn't I? You saved her. You brought her back to me. She'll be acquitted, and she'll stay here until she's cured. Yeah. And now it's up to you, Jane. You have to leave Dorothy's body. She won't be free until you're gone. Will you take good care of her? I promise. Keep it. David loved you so much. I'll keep it forever. Good-bye, my love. Dorothy? Is that you? Has Jane been crying? She was here. She's gone now. She's with her son... David. Do you think they're all gone? Duncan and Kurt and Mary? And Mimi, too? You have to learn to live on your own now, Dorothy. You're free. # No charm # # No spell # # Never # # Harm # # Come our # # Lovely # # Lady # # Nigh # # Philomel # # With melody # # Sing in our sweet lulla-lulla-lulla # # Sing in our sweet lullaby # # Come our lovely # # Lady nigh # # So, good night, with lulla-lulla-lulla # # So good night with lullaby # # Weaving # # Spiders # # Come not here # # Beetles black # # Approach not near # # Worm nor snail # # Do not offend # # Sing in our sweet lulla-lulla-lulla # # Sing in our sweet lullaby # # Come our lovely # # Lady nigh # # So good night with lulla-lulla-lulla # # So good night with lullaby # # Now all # # Is well # # Lovely # # Night #
