Let's go check it out, old-timer. - Jack. - Dad. Dad! Should I shake him? Definitely. Dad... Dad! Where's Dad? I don't know. Come on, Mom! What is he up to now? I see presents. But not Dad. Well, he's got to be around here somewhere. - Woof, woof! - Oh my gosh! What... what are you doing? Dad, what are you doing in a dog costume? Jack. Happy birthday, buddy. Cool! Can I wear it? Caden, your presents. Oh yeah, presents! What do you think it is, buddy? Wide box. Cool! A superhero cape? Awesome! - Come here. - It's a bird, it's a plane, oh, it's Caden. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, that looks good. - Perfect. - Okay, open this one next, open this one next. Oh, well, what could that be? Camo? Cool! Camouflage? Yeah! In case he wants to hide it or something. Oh, right. Oh, honey, you are going to love this. Oh, my goodness. We started out with so much promise. Honey. Isn't that cute? Oh, yeah. I think this one almost got away. Huh? A... puppy? A Puppy for me? Yeah, it is. Uh, Jack? Who-- who is going to take care of this puppy? I mean, that is a big responsibility. Oh, honey, it's a rescue. Besides... who can say no to this face, huh? - Look, we have matching capes! - Aww. You two are a dynamic duo, what you are. You need a cape too, Mom. Oh, honey. Ohh... Mom doesn't need a cape. She's already a superhero. Hmm... I'll get it. Dad? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Oh, Jack's fine. He got Caden a puppy for his birthday. I know. No. No, nothing has changed since we last talked. I know. Yeah, I know. It's a pterodactyll It's a rocket! No, it's Super Caden! Nothing can stop the vessel of power, justice, and just total coolness! Oh no, it's the Destructo Puppy! No! Help, Caden! Help me! Uh-Oh. It's the Decaffeinatorl The boss of the universe. We're doomed. You guys are too much. Caden, can you go get dressed please and take... Um, does this little guy have a name yet? He's a real super dog puppy. Jack. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, no, he battled all the puppies in the shelter and I hear he took a huge bite out of crime. A real hero. Cool. So... what's his name? Charlie. Charlie? Why Charlie, buddy? Is that a dog name? What about-- I don't know-- Sparky or Cooper or-- Charlie. His name is Charlie. It's Charles Radcliffe Owenbrook Ill. Charlie for short. Where did you come up with that? That's cool. You can call him anything you want, kiddo. All right, goofball. Charlie it is. Okay, now go get ready for your day, okay? Hey, if you do, there might be some birthday cake in it for you. - Birthday cake? - Oh yeah. Awesome! Come on, Charlie. Superheroes unite! - Come on! Come on, Charlie, come on! So you sure you won't come with us? Delivering toys to the toy drive at the children's hospital? It's gonna be a lot of fun. No, no, no, no, that's okay. You two go. It's good to have something, you know, special for you two to share. It's... it's really great of you to do this, you know? Well, you know... I am a pretty great guy. Yeah. Got a great kid. And now... a new great dog. Yeah. A great wife. Jack. - I want to make this work. - Don't. Let's not do this in front of Caden, especially on his birthday. Oh. Oh, that is not fair. God... No, honey, I didn't mean it-- You are the one who always gets to play. I always have to be the grownup. I'm the one who has to discipline, I'm the one who has to have a real job. - Faith-- - No. I wanted this to work. I supported your dreams for a long time. But then those dreams never became a viable business. You're amazing at what you do, Jack, but it's become a hobby. And we have a child. And now a dog. And I cannot continue to support a family and an expensive hobby on my own. I know, I know, but things are gonna change really soon. Honey, I've been working on this new toy-- Please. Don't. Faith. Once you can be more responsible, supporting your family's future... What's this? I love you. - Open it. - Oh. Oh, I don't know. We can't afford this, this... Oh, Jack. Wow. - Jack! - What? - Really? - What? No, honey, I'm gonna give you an upgrade as soon as I can, but... Honey, this decoder ring is the coolest. Did you look at it? We're ready, Dad. Okay, buddy. I picked these out for the hospital kids and... Charlie! It's my birthday, not yours! Oh, God, I spent hours on that cake yesterday. Looks like you did a good job. Look at him go. Oh... This is your day, nine-year-old... and I am so proud of you for sharing it with the other kids. You know, I think it's about time I get these superheroes out of here, huh? A lot of crime fighting to do, gifts to give. People to see, places to go, that sort of thing. Yeah, that's probably best. Unless you guys want to make more of a mess, you know, maybe spill some milk or, I don't know, break some of my dishes. Have a good day, honey. Your phone. Yes! Oh, I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on. Bye. Come on, Charlie! Bye. Mom! Love you! Love you, honey, bye! Come on! Come on, Charlie! Come on! Ready, Charlie? Come on, Charlie! Come on, come on! Remember, Charlie, anything's possible. - Ready for anything? Come on. All the hours of preparation, all the planning, all the blood, sweat and tears, it's all lead up to this one sweet, glorious moment. - Think it'll work? Me too. I believe in us. Let's go. It's showtime! What was that? Wonderful. It's a brainless bully brigade. Sounds like we're under attack. Hey there, freak show! Why don't you go play with an actual human being? What you waiting for? You and your scaredy-cat dog afraid? You hear that, Charlie? He called you a scaredy-cat! No dog should have to deal with - that kind of talk. Let's show them who they're messing with. Come on, chicken! Yeah, chicken! Ready. boy? Superheroes unite! Can you understand us or should we start barking? One... Are you gonna let your flea-bitten mutt do all the talking? I always knew he was the smarter one between the two of you. Two... Looks like you got yourself into a sticky situation. Actually, it looks like you got yourselves into a sticky situation! Want some pancakes with that? This isn't over! You're right, it's not over, is it, Charlie? Well, let's show the nice little children what else we have in store for them. You look like a pink rooster. So do you, dude. We're gonna get you for this! Oh, I'm so scared. Looks like your three-year-old sister's bedroom exploded in your face! We're going to find you, punk! Hey, Dad. Pink feathers, huh? Can you hand me those pliers? Scooter and Robbie think they're so cool. Well, you didn't let 'em get to you now, did you? No. You know... those two are bullies. And you're an amazing kid and they're just jealous of you. I don't think so, Dad. All right, talk to me. Well, Dad, why would they be jealous of me? I mean, they have all this awesome stuff. Scooter has a big-screen TV in his room with three different video game systems and Robbie carries his video games everywhere he goes. I don't have any of that stuff. I just have these stupid toys that don't do anything. They think I'm weird. - Maybe I am weird-- - Hey. You stop right there, Caden. You're not weird. Toys we make here are way cooler. So what if you have to use your mind and your imagination to play with them? When did that become a bad thing? They're spoiled bullies that stare at screens all day. I don't think that's very awesome at all. It can't be doing much for their brains, either. Come on, they throw eggs at you? How original is that? You shot syrup at 'em. I mean, everybody knows that syrup is a way more advanced breakfast-based battle toy. And then you top it off with pink feathers? That's classy, buddy. And besides, their big, technified" bully brains came up with some of the worst name-calling that I've ever heard. How'd you know? Your mother called. She was worried. I mean, come on. The best they could come up with was flea-bitten mutt"? And scaredy-cat dog. All right. Hey, why don't you grab your attack dog over there and follow me, 'cause I have something to show you. Robbie! Can you chill? Have you ever heard of pause? Put that baby toy away and focus. Fine. It's not a baby toy. It's got two ARM processors, an ARM 7E-S main CPU and a TDMI pro-processor at clocked speeds of 67 megahertz and 33 megahertz, respectively. You are such a techie tool. Come on. We are not letting Wonder toy boy get away with feathering us. We're almost there. Now, where are we going and what exactly are we going to do? We're going to your grandma's house for cookies and milk. Huh? My grandma lives four hours away, and, dude, you know I'm lactose intolerant. Come on! Can't you reboot your brain or something? We are going to get dog boy. He wasn't at his little girly playhouse so he must be at his daddy's pathetic excuse for a toy store. My dad has a real toy store. Too bad for Lame and Lame -Jr. They're going down. What are you gonna show me, Dad? It's what I've been working on for the last three years. Now, I've been waiting to show you until I knew for sure that it worked. Does it? Yes. Well, what is it? Dad? It's just... I think I've done it this time, son. Invented a toy that can not only change things for me, but... for us. But it could be so much bigger than that. It's just I'm a little nervous. I thought I had it in the past and, well, for whatever reason, things just didn't take off. You mean like My Funky Pet Skunky? That was just a little too lifelike. The Helium Plus Super Balloon. Somehow I forgot to test on under-sixes. Ahh: Ahh: Ultimate Army Ant Farm. The Supersonic One-Man Band Set. Life-size Bubba Bubble Gum. - The Turbo Skateboard that-- - Yes. Yeah, yes, okay. In the past, not everything has worked out as I planned. I think I did it this time. I just hope it works. I want to keep the toy store. And I want to make you proud. You're my dad. I'll always be proud of you, no matter what. Okay. What if I could change back the way children play? To tap into their imagination like no one else has? Dad, seriously, show me. The suspense is killing me. Breathe in this moment, Caden. Ready, Dad. Go ahead. Wow; Ready, buddy? Ready, Dad. Here we go. Hold on to your seats, gentlemen. Wow; Wow. Wow. Dad... it's amazing. What is it? It's Wondermation. It's everything. It's anything you want it to be. Imagine something that can transform more amazingly than any transformer, that can sculpt more fantastically than any modeling clay, that can create more creatively than any dream. All you have to do is use your imagination. It can be anything you want it to be. Anything? - Anything? - Anything? Anything. But how? I've been working on it for years, creating the ultimate transforming, creationin"" imaginationing" toy. Do you see that? Whatever. It's just another one of his crazy ideas. I needed to perfect the scientific formula for the ideal substance that could access the wildest gamut of toy-making material. Well, that's a bunch of technical boring stuff. Basically, it can... Well, I think it can. No, I believe it can become any toy you desire. All you have to do is believe and use your imagination. Oh yeah, and it has to be a real toy. None of this silly electronic stuff. Can you see? - Take a video with your phone. - What? Have you lost your mind? What he's talking about is impossible. Shut up, I know. Just take it, just in case. My dad has to see this. If Professor Looney Tunes has created something incredible, we're gonna get our hands on it before anybody else does. Good plan! Dude, I said take a video, not a picture! Come on, let's go! Don't let them see us! It's okay, buddy. There's nobody out there. Come on, I want to see what Wondermation can do. Come on. Okay, so-- so what you're telling me is that the completely bonkers toy Wonder man-child has made a toy that not only works but is also absolutely amazing? Not possible. He's a total fruitcake. What, sweetie? Did you say fruitcake? I think we still have some left over from your mother's-- No, Misti, no. But didn't you just say fruitcake? I can get you boys some, it's no trouble. - No. - No. But you can make me dinner later, how's that? Okay. Uh... is this it? Wow. Awesome. I'm telling you, I didn't get a really close look but it actually looked pretty amazing, which is too cool for his loser and his loser son to have for themselves. - Just look at this. - Okay. Scooter, I really can't tell anything from this video, son. See how it shuts off there with the bright flash? You're gonna have to bring me something better than that for me to bother with a lower-level competitor who makes magical toys " Okay? Okay, Dad. I'll get you what you wanted. How's dinner coming, baby? Oh, what a day. There you go. Can I get you guys anything else? Want anything? Aw, thanks, boy. That's why I let you stay inside. Charlie! Where's your manners? I am so sorry. - He's a hopeless flirt. - Oh, no worries. He's adorable. Now, I don't want to rush you guys, but just to let you know, we close in about 15 minutes. Wait, it's almost 9:00? Yes, sir, it's a quarter 'til. Oh, your mother is gonna kill me. Where did the time go? Okay. No, that's not for you. - Dad? - Yeah. Your Wondermation toy box is really amazing. Really. Thanks, buddy. I knew you could do it, Dad. I knew you could make the awesome-st toy in the whole world. Oh, come here. I never stopped believing in you. That means so much to me. - No. Okay, I gotta get you home. Hand me your book bag. Here. - Come on, come on. - Okay. Okay... Cupcake. Got everything? II' What's this, buddy? Well, open it already. You didn't have to... Oh. Just believe. Is this a falling star? Do you remember what you told me the time we saw a falling star at the lake? You said, Look, a falling star!" And I said, Can I make a wish?" - And you said, You know--" - You know... I don't think you need any wishes. All you have to do... ... just believe in yourself and never give up. You'll make your own magic." And you did, Dad. You did. You made your own magic. You are the most... magical thing I ever helped make. Oh, your mother. - Oh, gosh. - She is going to kill us. Here, grab your book bag. You got everything? I know, Charlie did so good, didn't he? I know. When he took that first step... I know. He did so... Oh... Looks like you two had a good, long time. We did, Mom! It was so much fun! We had cupcakes, and Charlie almost ate a stuffed cat... What? Okay, okay, slow down, baby. Listen, why don't you take your stuff, go upstairs and get into bed, pronto. Chop-Chop Good night, buddy. Good night, Dad, love you! It's almost 10:00, Jack. I know. We were just having so much fun and I just... I lost track of time. Okay. Fine. I'm glad you guys had fun, but you can't just lose track of time, okay? And now I've got an overexcited ten-year-old boy hopped up on sugar at almost 10:00 at night. I understand. I mean, I know, Faith. I just hate that I don't get to spend all the time with him anymore. I know. It's hard on me, too. Just... just try, okay? Just... try to grow up a little bit. For Caden. I mean, you don't have to grow up entirely. Just a little bit. Okay? Okay. I could come in. Help you settle Caden down. Maybe we could talk a little bit. Um... I can't. - I'm sorry. - No, it's... Not-- not tonight. See you Wednesday? I come pick him up? Okay. Have a good night. Have a good night. Ha. - Fight! - We're gonna have to take matters into our own hands. We're gonna have to get those plans for whackman's" new toy. And how are we supposed to do that? The dude lives in his toy store. So we get him out of there. Wait a minute, I think my battery's low or something. I can't see. - Ow! - Body blow! Way out of there. We're gonna have to send him away for an entire night. And you're in no problem! - Ow! - Body blow! Ugh... Game over. Hey, what is that? Every year, Mr. Amrak and his team invite only ten of the most promising, innovative toymakers in the country to share their most amazing creations. The grandest toy will receive distribution with our company and the opportunity to be shared with all the children in the world." That's it! Robbie! Robbie, come on, man. There's no time for resting now. I've got our plan. Game over. Come on, kiddos. Lunch is served. Oh. Hey, Dad. I'm just making lunch for the boys. Up. Mom, phone! Jack? Yeah, he had Caden last night. Took him home at almost 10:00 at night. Oh, it's Dad! Hey, Dad. Hey, buddy. - Is your mom there? - Sure. Mom! I know. That's okay, we talked about it, it's fine. Well, she's kind of busy. You want me to give her a message? Uh, yeah, sure. Do me a favor. Let her know that I'm going out of town for a couple of days, and I know I'm supposed to pick you up on Wednesday and I am so sorry. Um... I got this big invite in the mail this morning and it's a big deal in Los Angeles, so I have to drive straight through if I'm gonna make it. Los Angeles? Like, California, Los Angeles? How long you gonna be gone? Just for a couple days and I'm gonna be home on your birthday, buddy, I promise. What about the store? I'm just gonna shut it down for a couple days. I can't pass up this opportunity. This is Amrak's Annual Toy Search. It's an honor just to be invited. You'll let your mom know, won't you? Sure thing, Dad. I came by earlier, you guys weren't there, so I left the invite underneath the mat in front of the door. It has all the information on it and stuff in case of emergencies. Make sure your mom gets it. Yeah. Hey, if l wasn't in such a rush, I would run by. I could talk to your mom if you want to run and grab her real quick. Dad, it's cool. It's handled. Just chillax, 'kay? Okay- If it's cool, then... and it's handled, I will chillax. You know, it's all... it's all good in the hood, yo. Did I say that right, buddy? Dad, please. Right, I'm sorry. Okay, I gotta go. I gotta lock up the store and I have to get on the road. I have a long drive ahead of me. Keys. Um... I love you, buddy. I love you too, Dad. How about I call you later? Okay. All right, great, love you too. Mm-hmm, bye-bye. Come on, Charlie! Caden, lunch! You too, Charlie. I see you haven't gotten that beast trained yet. I can say the same thing. You think you got all the answers, don't you? Did you girls need something or you just like carrying flowers around the neighborhood? My stepmom wanted me to give these to your mom. How nice. She obviously must feel sorry for her or something. Have a nice day, loser. - Whoa! - Whoa! How mature. You gotta have your mutt fight your battles, huh? Hope your loser dad has fun in Lost Angeles, loser! Ow! What? How do they know Dad's going to Los Angeles? Hey, there you are. Who was that? Robbie Hutchins and Scooter Reed. Well, this is nice. Scooter Reed. His mom is Misti Reed? Huh. Yeah, she and her wardrobe have been a very interesting addition to the PTA. Big brick house at the end of the street, right? It's his stepmom. Yeah, the big Greek house. Are you okay, sweetie? Yeah. Okay, good. Hey, look, don't you worry about this, okay? We're gonna get this all cleaned up. Come on, goofballs. Come on, Charlie.

Bases loaded, here's the pitch! Holy mow! Right between the pitcher's legs! All the way to home base. The ball's in the outfield. And he scores. The Yankees lose to the Rangers. At 5:00, he met a boy. ...Hey, you'. said the grouchy lady bug, 'You wanna fight?' Waited for the answer to reply. 'Oh, you're not big enough,' said the grouchy ladybug, and flew off." That's one grouchy ladybug. At 5:00, it met a wave. 'You wanna fight?' The wave didn't answer at all. You're not big enough anyway,' said the grouchy ladybug and flew off." And flew off. And flew off, that's right. Dad. Yes, yes? What is it? Remember when we used to play superheroes? Superheroes. What made you think of that? I was just... remembering. Mm-hmm. Well, I just bought you a bunch of expensive Wii games. Why don't you remember that? You're a little too old to be playing make believe. Don't you think? I was just kidding, Dad. I can't hear you when you mumble, son. I was just kidding, Dad. Duh. Hey, this is Chip. Did you call me? What happened, the alarm go off? Well, call the police. I almost forgot. You are invited to attend the exclusive Amrak Toy Company's Every year, Mr. Amrak and his team invite only ten of the most promising, innovative toymakers in the country to share their most amazing creations. The grandest toy will receive distribution with our company and the opportunity to be shared with all the children in the world." No! This is Misti's stationery! It's a setup, Charlie! Those bullies tricked Dad! I gotta get you home. Dad! But why? What do they get out of this? Why do they want Dad out of the store? There must be a reason. Whatever they're up to, we need to be one step ahead. That's it, Charlie! We'll stay at the store while Dad's gone! And be ready for whatever those bullies are planning. Mom thinks we're going to Dad's. Dad thinks we're going to stay with Mom. I'm a genius! Fine, you're a genius. Caden! Well, have you packed for your Dad's yet? Sure, Mom, I'm packed. I'm gonna ride my bike over. You are becoming so grown up. I love you, sweetie. Love you too, Mom. He fell for it. Operation Steal The Plans is on. We commence tomorrow. Don't worry, Dad. I'll make you proud. Lord, not now, please. Why didn't I fill up earlier? It's... the next gas station? No, we're never gonna make that. Is that... Oh, is that a gas station? It can't be a gas station. It just said 50 miles. Looks like a gas station, looks like a gas station. Oh please, Lord, be a gas station. Please be a gas station. How are we this morning? I trust you're pleased you got here just when you did. Yeah, thank God you're here. For a minute, I thought I was out of luck. And then-- poof-- here you guys are. Yeah, we often get confused with luck. Right... all right. Oh, hey... do you pump it or do I? We're full service here, sir. All right, fancy. Does that cost me extra? Don't worry. I'm on your side. No extra charge. Thank you. Charles Radcliffe Owenbrook Ill. Hello, what can I do you for? Is your name really Charles Owenbrook Ill? People call me Charlie. Oh, this... Wow. Oh, what are the odds? Well, they say truth is stranger than fiction. I've driven this road before and I've never seen this gas station here. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm glad you're here, because I am completely empty. Of gas? Or are we talking about something else? No, gas. Your employee is pumping it now, I think. Mm-hmm. Well, it's good you stopped in. We haven't had a customer in quite some time. No offense, but you're kind of remote. Appears we are, yes. Can I get you something else? Nope, just the gas. You sure? About the gas? Yes, sir. You have a family, Jack. A son? Um, yes, I have a son. He's, um... He's a great kid. He's got a vivid imagination and-- That's wonderful. Vivid imagination is important. You know, creativity is highly underestimated these days. Yes, I know. I mean, isn't it a shame, the kids today? Me, personally, I blame it on the parents. You know, they're all wrapped up in electronics and technology, they're focused on the quickest way to anything. The quickest way to gratification. I mean, they completely ignore anything else that's important. I know. It's a shame. But it is true that some people do focus on one thing and forget about paying attention to the things that are most important in life, the things that are right in front of them. That's $80. Oh, yes, sir. Let's see. There you go. But the good thing is that it's never too late to make it right, to make things the way they ought to be. You're all set. Have a good trip. Um... yeah. Tell Amrak I say hello. Oh, and, Jack? Remember... just believe. You called me Jack. Just believe" is our thing. You got a ways to go to Los Angeles, Jack. And remember, real success begins with that first leap of faith. And for you, that leap is your trip. It was random that I got the invite. I mean, I'm excited about the trip and everything, but-- But nothing's random, Jack. There's an order to everything. Okay, what's going on here? Oh... Okay... okay. Okay, I gotta be losing my mind. What is this, The Twilight Zone"? It's never too late to make things right. God, come on. Our biggest mission ever. We have to be ready for anything. Hey, honey. Are you about ready to go to your Dad's? Sure, Mom, I'm almost ready. Okay, 'cause I'm about to head to work, okay? Is that everything? Hey. So are we set? Moron! Excuse me. Not you, moron. The game moron. Okay, can you join the real world for just a minute? Fine. Yes, I told my mom I'm going to your house. Perfect. My dad thinks I'm going to your house. So where are we going? We're breaking into Wonder Free Toys and taking the Wonder freaking plans, remember? You're not wimping out on me, are you? No, dude, chill. It's cool, I'm in. Just wondering where we're actually going is all. So where are we going? Just shut up and meet me at the square. We'll scout out the place and make sure he's out of there. We lay low for a while, then we make our move. - Moron! What was that? Sorry. Where did you say we were going again? I'll see you in a few. Robbie, what are you doing in there? Ahh. What's he doing there? And who's the dame? I don't know. Looks familiar, though. Clear a path, sister. Now maybe you can afford to pay attention next time. Yeah. That's not how you treat a girl. But then again, what do you guys know about girls? Shut up, dog boy Yeah, dog boy. What was that about? Who knows? Who cares? Change of plans, though. What? Why? What do you want to do now? I'm paralyzed with options. This is Robbie Hutchins and I'm here with Scooter Reed. We're about to embark on a risky expedition. If we don't make it back alive, we want our parents to know that we love them and... Mom, I'm sorry I lied about your grandmother's crystal jewelry box. It was me who broke it, but it was an accident. I just want you to know that if I had made it out alive, I would have sold all my gaming systems to buy you a new one. I know it's not the same, but... Robbie, we're not going to Iraq. We're stealing one measly little set of plans from a toy store that is going out of business. Come on. It's go time. All quiet over here. How about you? Copy, over. Copy that. Dude, are you playing a game while you're supposed to be working? What?! No. Why? Is Joker Jr. even in there anymore? - Dude! - Coming. Come on! Come here, Charlie! Whose phone is this? Hi, Robbie. I'm so sorry to bother you and your little friend but you left your blankie at home. I know how you have a hard time falling sleepy-bye if you don't have it to snuggle. Call me if you want me to drop it by. Bye-bye, poo-poo buns Poo-poo buns? Robbie, we are not going to Iraq. We're stealing one measly little set of plans from a toy store that is about to go out of business. There's nobody out there. Hope your loser dad has fun in Lost Angeles, loser. Charlie! They're trying to steal Wondermation! That's why they wanted Dad in Los Angeles! Too bad for them, we-'re still in town. Come on, Charlie! We're walking right in? That's right, game boy. No fear. No fear is right. Ha-ha, suckers. Are you gonna bring the pain or not? What? Like right now? But I've almost beaten level 12. And I'm about to beat your head. Let's go, come on. We make our own magic. - Where are they? - I don't know. You guys need some help? I think it's you that's gonna need the help, - loser boy! - Yeah! Well, catch us if you can! - Let's get him! - Right! Come on. Target in sight. - Let's move. - Oh! They're not here. Right. He took the plans. Looking for these? Come on. - Let's get him! - Right! We're gonna get you, dog boy! What are we gonna do now? Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho... Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho... What is this? It's... it's vanilla! - Get in there. - I don't think-- I don't pay you to think. But you don't pay me at all. Exactly, now get in there! Come on, go! Ow, help me, I'm stuck! Help me, dude, I'm stuck! Get in there! Ow! Get in there, man! Go, go! Come on! Is this better or worse than the feathers? I mean, so far. Come on! Come on, let's get him! - May I help you? - Yes, - I guess I need to check in. Amrak Toys. Yeah, I understand. I understand your dilemma, but there's simply nothing I can do. No, sorry. It's out of my hands. Alrighty, bye-bye May I help you? Amrak Toy Search, I need to check in. Alrighty, name? Jack Wonder. Nope, there's nothing here. Have a good day, then. - Bye-bye. No, excuse me. Amrak Toys. I'm sorry, I cannot accomplish that for you. I understand your dilemma. Yeah. I really don't need to hear any more of this story. Alrighty, bye-bye Excuse me. Is there something else I can do for you, sir? Yes, could you please check again? I'm sorry, Mister... - Wonder. - Right. You are not on my list. This convention is invitation only. I have an invitation, so please, check again. I'm sorry, that won't be necessary. You're not on the list. - Have a great day. Amrak Toys. Sir, you're not on the list. Nothing you say or do right now will make your name appear on that list. There's simply nothing I can do. Does that make sense? You have to get me in that convention. I just drove halfway across the country and I shut down my toy store. I have an invitation. It came in a pink envelope. You're mistaken. We don't send our invites via pink envelopes, sir. This is out of my hands. Good day. Here, now maybe you can afford to pay attention next time. You look like an ice cream sundae! Wait! Let's get him! Whoa! What's your problem, man?! - Come on, let's go! - Right! All you have to do... ... just believe in yourself and never give up. You'll make your own magic." And you did, Dad. You did. You made your own magic. Mr. Blunder. Wonder. Of course. What are you gonna try to do now, sir? You may just want to hold your breath 'cause I simply don't care what you have to say. I need you to check me into this convention. Right, I understand your dilemma-- No. It'll be your dilemma if you don't check me in. You can take time away from your monotonous, self-indulgent secretarial existence and playing with whatever power you think you have on the good people that care to hear me out for one second. Mr. Amrak built this corporation on a philosophy, a philosophy of wonderful toys, simple, real toys that could be the gateway for children to nurture their imagination. A philosophy that challenges kids to find strength in fantasy, and power in creation and ingenuity in original thoughts. He wanted to allow kids, people the opportunity to think broader than conventional thoughts. And I believe-- I know, that I have a toy that champions that philosophy. And if Mr. Amrak was here right now, he would insist that you not hinder me showing it to him. And being the largest toy distributor on the earth, in tum, sharing it with all the kids in the world... he would insist on you extending this opportunity to me. Just like somebody... extended an opportunity to him when he was an unknown toymaker with nothing but great ideas and a dream to show them. You're absolutely right. He'd insist. Good evening, Mister... Wonder. Yes, Mr. Wonder. I'm Phillip Amrak. Are you? And, uh... I really liked what you had to say. But unfortunately, the convention has just wrapped up. Sorry. Wait. Mr. Wonder, you got me interested. Let's see what you got. - Ahh! - Whoa! What's your problem, man? He's making a break for it! Camo. Good thinking, Dad! Those plans are mine! You forget I know where you live, Caden! So much for bringing the pain. I'm about to deliver it. Hey. guys, over here! Over here! You guys must really be desperate for toys at your dad's shop. Why don't you quit running like a little girl and face us? If I'm running like a girl and you still can't catch me, what does that make you? He's got a point there, Scooter. Shut up, Robbie! Well, he does! He's making a break for it! - We're gonna get you, Caden! - Yeah! Are you serious? Wait, go the other way! Hey. girls! Watch this! Hey, streamer boys! Catch me if you can! Well, I certainly do thank you for the call and thanks for the heads-up. It was my pleasure. Right on time. Just like we planned. Come on, Robbie! I'm new at this. I've never run this much in my entire life. No one has. Shouldn't we just cut our losses and go home? Failure is not an option. That's why all my video games have reset buttons. Look up, buttercup. My neighborhood's up ahead. It ends there. Victory is imminent. I'm gonna step out for a minute. I'll be back. Okay. Hey. Dog boy- Ooh, I'm so scared. You're gonna dry me to death? Well, this baby's actually a bit modified from its original factory condition, if you catch my drift. Dude, I play video games for a living. I've faced on mega tanks, rail guns the size of Texas. Your salon special scares me not. Plus, two of us, one of you. Do the math. You can't blast us both. You were saying? Hasta la vista, boys! How touching. That really was sweet to watch. Let me out of here! Get me out of here, Caden. I take it you've had enough? You recognize this? My phone! It's says Mommy. Wanna answer it? I better. Hi, Mom. What? You're where? Caden's house? But why? I was sure you guys would want to share this special time with your parents, so we called them ahead of time. And here they come now. Poindexter Scott Reed! Poindexter? You are in very big trouble, my friend. Very big trouble. - Ow! - You think that hurts? Just wait until we get home. And what possessed you to do this in the first place? Scooter made me do it, Mom. You know I have self-esteem issues. Ow! You want to explain this to me? Right now, young man, right now. Okay. We tried to get the plans for Mr. Wonder's toy, the one I told you about. The one you said I needed to get more info on before you'd listen to me. Don't try to put this on me, son. I just wanted you to listen to me, for once. Like you used to. Uh... What is going on in my backyard? Why are you not at your Dad's? Well, that's a long story. Start talking. But before you do, based on this explanation, which I'm sure is very logical, just know that you may not see the light of day until you're 18, okay? Spill it. This is inexcusable. You know that, right? Inexcusable. You can't just go around committing corporate espionage, son. You know, there are gonna be consequences for this, serious consequences. What were you thinking? When did you even think of this? I know it was wrong, Dad. I just wanted to get the plans for Mr. Wonder's invention and give them to you. I thought you'd be proud of me if I did something that could help your business. Yeah, but not like this, son. You don't do business this way. You understand that, right? All right. Scooter, you are... by no means off the hook. But I think I know what you were trying to do. You were just trying to get my attention, weren't you, son? I haven't been there for you much lately, have I? Get you out of this. You Okay? I want you to know something, son. All that not-being-there-for-you stuff... that's gonna change. Honey... Listen, I know that you wanted to protect your dad but you really should have told me. What is it, boy? Dad! Hey, buddy. What's going on here? Caden, go ahead and tell him. Uh, first-- Dad, what happened in LA? I tried to call you to tell you that the invite was a setup, but your phone was in my backpack. They loved it. - Really? - Really. Okay, who loved what? I'm completely in the dark here, so... First, these are for you. Thank you. And they loved it. I'm talking head over heels, chills down your spine, want to distribute it" loved it. Loved what? What did you do? You didn't tell me this part. It's what I promised. To build the ultimate toy and set our family up for life. Things are gonna change for the better for us. I knew you could do it. I believed in you. So... what exactly did you create? That's what I was trying to tell you! The Wondermation Imagination Toy Box, Mom! Dad's new invention! That's what Scooter and Robbie were chasing me for. I saved the plans. Robbie. Your phone? Don't forget to show your mom that cool video about your grandmother's jewelry box. Thanks a lot, dude. Jewelry box! I knew it was you! Wait 'til we get home, Robert Francis. Ow, ow... Thanks, April. Can you believe this? When did our little boy get big enough to even think about doing something so crazy? I think our little boy is growing up. I've been doing some growing up, too. What? Oh, Jack. No more decoder ring, Faithy. This is the real deal. Oh... Jack... the ring never mattered. You did. I love you. I love you too, Faith. You think they'll forget about this whole running around the town, setting traps, making a huge mess all over the place" thing we did? Not a chance. I don't know. I mean, he was pretty creative as he went about it. Jack... - Superheroes unite!
