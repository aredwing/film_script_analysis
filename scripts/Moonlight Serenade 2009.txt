I don't need to know your homework technique, son. Give me something I can chew on. Don't worry, Mr. Beretsky, I'm about to give you a mouthful. According to the research compiled by Miss Webster here, more than 60 percent of your current portfolio is rated at mid-risk to dangerous. You can find weak spots in any company. None of this means anything until we verify it. These companies have been stable for years. Check out everything if you want. It'll take weeks. Meanwhile, state regulators have investigations pending on both Klasco and DeBridge, which, I believe, are two of your biggest holdings. Due respect, sir, but without some serious hedging, you're ripe for a big fall, and soon. I've heard enough. Carl, wait, uh, we have other investment ideas. Better ones. Formulated by better brokers. Let me introduce you to a few... I'm not interested in other brokers. I like the way he thinks. That went fantastically well. Yeah, you think Holtzman trusts me? Forget Holtzman He isn't smart enough to trust you. Beretsky does. That's what's important. A whole new part of your life is starting right now. After this, it's only a matter of time before there'll be a handful of Carl Beretskys begging you to take care of their money... at the investment firm of Nate Holden and Associates. Well... Go on. Go on. Get going. No, wait. Here. Here. Got it. At last My love has come along And my lonely days are over And life is like A song At last Skies above are blue And my heart was wrapped up in clover For you are mine At last Frank D., everybody, right here at The House. Stevie Cotter on guitar. Tony Banda, Ramon Banda. Our special guest this Friday and Saturday, Khani Cole. - Nate, where you going? - I'm sorry, Frank. I gotta go. Are we gonna see you for an entire show? You're lucky I could stay for the set. We got this new big shot client. He has me up to my ears. Alright. Well, did I tell you Junior's starting private school next month? Hey. Don't worry, Frank. I'll take care of you. All right. When I fall in love It will be completely Or I'll never fall In love In a restless world like this is Love is ended before its begun - And too many - And too many - Moonlight kisses - Moonlight kisses - Seem to cool - Seem to cool - With the warmth of the sun - With the warmth of the sun When I give my heart My heart It will be forever Forever - Or I'll never give - Or I'll never give - My heart - My heart And the moment I can feel that You feel That way too That's when I fall When I'll fall in love With - With you - You Yes! Yes, yes! Hil-Co. I think we might have something here with the reshuffling at Hil-Co. Feels like a smoke screen to me, like they're changing the band on the Titanic. What do you think? Sorry. What? Did you read the Hil-Co story? Uh, no. I haven't gotten to it yet. Something about it feels right to me. Sorry, Mr. Holden has a phone call. Take a message. It's the police. Nate Holden. Hi, Mr. Holden? This is the Weehawken Police. There was a break-in at a residence that's registered in your name. We're gonna need you to come down here and speak with the detectives. As far as we can tell there's at least three other houses in your neighborhood that were hit last night. I don't know if you have an inventory of your valuables or not. No, this was my mother's house. There weren't many valuables. Well, as you can see, they turned the house upside down pretty well. - Yeah. - Though there is a room down the hall where the door's locked. We're not quite sure about that. We could pop it open and take a look, if you'd like. No, no, that's okay. Nate, go take a look. Thanks anyway. Well, suit yourself. Take a look around. If you change your mind, let me know. Thank you. Excuse me. My God. What? I took this photograph. You remember? Yeah. - Why isn't this at your apartment? - I don't know. - Well, here. Take it with you. - Look! I don't want to deal with this right now. Well, you're not just gonna leave it here. That's the plan. Here you go. - Here you go. - Thank you. Excuse me. Are you Nate Holden? - Yes. - I thought so. My father hates you. Uh, did you and I date? His hatred for you is strictly professional. Hi, I'm Marie Devrenier. My father's Robert Devrenier. The CEO of Duocon. They had kind of a rough patch last year. Yes, which you rode all the way to the bank. Yeah. Look, uh, it's been kind of a long day, and I don't really like to talk business while I'm here, so... I'm sorry. Yeah. Neither do I. Would you like to have a drink with me and my friends? We won't talk business. I promise. Uh, maybe some other time. Wow. You're not selling me short, too, are you, Nate? No, really, it's nothing personal, and, um... like I said, hopefully some other time. Okay. But I'm gonna hold you to that. Bye. So, Nate, what are you doing tomorrow night? You free? I'll be in your neighborhood. "Chloe sings. The Last Stop". Come on, Frank. I gotta work. Ah, all right. Is, uh, everything okay between you and Charlene? Of course. Why? Oh, you know, I'm just wondering why you're wasting your time driving halfway across the city on your night off. - Who says it's a waste of time? - Aw, come on, Frank. There's got to be 2,000 girls in this city making up little postcards and singing at rundown joints like the Last Stop. And, okay, maybe in the end, one of two of them have got what it takes to sing in a place like this, but come on, do the math. The odds are a thousand to one this girl is not wasting your time. Have a good evening. It's yours. That's Chloe. You didn't know that? - No. - You know, Nate, music isn't money. Somebody gave me a shot once, I wanna return the favor. - That's the way it works. - Excuse me. Hey, Chloe. I think this just came off your bracelet. Oh. Thank you. You need to apologize to her. Excuse me. Thank you. Do you need a ride? 'Cause we're going across town. No, Jesse'll be here any minute. Thank you. - Do you want us to wait? - No, that's okay. You guys go ahead. I'll see you on Friday night? - Okay. - Okay. Bye. Can I give you a ride home? No, thanks. Uh, all right, I'll walk with you, then. I'm fine. Just leave me alone, okay? When I fall in love It will be forever Or I'll never fall In love Thank you. Found that outside my window. Where you sang with me. Look, I hope... you didn't take what I said before too personally. - I... - Ugh. Hey! Wait! Look, I spend all day and most of my nights predicting failure. It's my job. I'm very good at it. - Well, I'm sorry for you. - Well, I'm not. I believe in what I do, but... I need music to keep me sane. That's why I go to the club every night. That's why I play a song or two before bed. It helps me... I don't know, it helps me keep in touch with a part of my... - A part of your soul? - Yeah! Yeah. Do you know how many drunken confessions I hear from suits like you? Every week. "Oh, I hate my job. I should have been a musician". Look. You apologized, and I accept your apology. So let's stop this before it gets any more annoying, okay? But I'm not drunk. And I'm not confessing anything. I just want you to play music with me. - That's... - No, thanks. - I don't do charity work. - It wasn't charity work the other night. No, it wasn't. It was a vocal warm-up. Excuse me? I play a gig near your house. I was warming up. You're a decent piano player, but there are a lot of them in this city that I should be playing with before you, including my boyfriend. Yeah, right. - What is so funny? - Come on. You're walking home alone late at night in this neighborhood? There is no way you have a boyfriend. No way. Look, I don't have to prove anything to you, Mister... - Just call me Nate. - But since you asked, here. Photograph doesn't prove anything. Here. You should read the back. It's kind of cute, actually. Anyway, this is my building. Thanks for the walk home... Nate. Yeah. - Morning. - Morning. You should take a look at this. Okay, but before I forget, this is Sunset-Western and DEK. I'd like you to take a look before lunch. - Sure. - And one more thing. - I'm sorry about yesterday. - Oh! Stop it. Stop. - And I appreciate your concerns. - Stop it. No. Look. I think I got a little overwhelmed there for a couple of days, but it's over and done with, so thank you. Well... Come on! They're lovely. Speaking of which, this is what Vogler gave us on Hil-Co. That's it? Don't waste my time, David. I know you have more on Hil-Co than two quarterly breakdown sheets. I did, but I don't anymore. - Where is it? - I honestly don't know. Right. You lost the research. I don't have what you're looking for You could check my files. No, no. I'll let Holtzman do it. Wow. You're first really big case, and you're running to Holtzman with some lame conspiracy theory that I'm, what, shredding documents? Not the best show of poise under pressure, kid. I mean, you might want to do your own research. That is, if you don't find what you're looking for here. Life gets a lot easier when you're not betting against people. We should do lunch sometime. Is Chloe coming on soon? Yeah. Should be. Comin' right up. All right. But I just talked to him. He's gonna be here any minute. - Don't lie to me. - Please? Look, I know it's annoying, but Jesse just needs to feel like people are waiting on him, but then he's fine. Three nights in a row he's been AWOL, while you and I are wasting our time here. You gotta stop doing this, Chloe. What Jesse needs is help. I know. I know. If I... From somebody other than you. You're too nice to be in this business. I can't afford to lose this gig, Rudy. Rudy... - Hey, Rudy, how ya doin'? - How ya doin'? Good night. - Hi. - Hi. Do you know "In The Wee Small Hours"? Uh... yeah. Can you play it? "A" flat? Uh, well, actually, I was just doing some work. In the wee small hours of the morning While the whole wide world Is fast asleep You lie awake And you think about the boy And never ever think of Counting sheep When your lonely heart Has learned its lesson He'd be here If only he'd call In the wee small hours Of the morning That's the time You miss him most Of all Do you want a glass of wine or something? If you're still interested in playing together, I can be back here tomorrow night at the same time. Did something happen to you? Look, if you don't mind, I'd like to keep this about music, okay? Sure. Same time tomorrow night? Yeah, same time tomorrow night. Pick up a hundred thousand on the first uptick. - Ten thousand-share increments? - Right. Now it's at 72 and a half. - So, say we start at... - Sixty-eight. Exactly, and watch it drop like a rock. Good, good. That's great. Love walked right in and drove the shadows away Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day One magic moment and my heart seemed to know That love said hello Though not a word was spoken One look and I forgot the gloom of the past One look and I had found my future at last One look and I had found a world completely new When love walked in with you So far we're ahead of schedule. Good. We're gonna build it around Hil-Co. Hil-Co was Vogler's baby. He give you any problems? David's been great. Thanks. I'm gonna work on these at home. - Snappy. - Ah ahh Right. Can I at least give you cab fare? No, I'm fine. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Reinhardt, it's Holden. Oh, boy, have I got a story to tell you about a company called Hil-Co. Love walked right in and drove the shadows away So, listen. Rumor has it that you're shorting Hil-Co. Where'd you hear that? Nate, come on. Don't tease us. We pay our secretaries good money for that. love said hello though not a word was spoken You have a good night. See you tomorrow. One look and I had found my future at last One look And I had found a world completely new When love walked in with you Hey, Dot. Oh. Excuse me. - Cream? - Oh, thank you, I... Say when. Uh... when. Sugar? Oh. No. Thank you. Sweet enough already, huh? - Ready, Terry? - Sure thing. Have a great day. These guys could hire Superman to run their company, and they'd still be looking at 12 to 15 months... of tough times. Oh, yeah, we're talking about years of dysfunction here. - One minute. - Right. Uh, Jimmy, I'm gonna have to call you back. Yeah, thanks. Bye. Nate, I want you to meet a friend of mine. Terrence Hill, this is Nate Holden, our brightest young portfolio manager. What a pleasure to meet you. Well, any friend of David's is... Terry is the CEO of Hil-Co. So, this is where it all happens. Word is you see our stock dropping We run a family business. When you tell the business world we are mismanaged or irresponsible, not only are you doing damage to our company but to my family as well. Well, facts are facts, Mr. Hill. These people you love have made a series of financial mistakes, and this little ambush that David has set up here for us won't change that or the negative impact it will eventually have on your stock. Which you have no qualms profiting from. David, please. This is not an ambush, Mr. Holden. - No... - This is an invitation. I'm here simply to invite you to consider our approach, to think as we do. It's easy to focus on the mistakes of the past. But we believe the changes we've made make us strong for the long term. The question is whether you have the foresight to believe it. - Have a great day. - Yes. Thank you. An invitation. Thank you, David. Who is that man? Terrence Hill. Oh. Uh, as in... Hil-Co. What happened? He stuck up for his company. I can't figure out why David is hell-bent on protecting them. He's jealous. You're young, you're single, you're attractive, and soon you'll be twice as rich as he is. - Come on. - Shall I call for takeout? No, no, I'm gonna grab something later at home. I don't want to stay here too late. But we're making good progress, don't you think? Yes, I suppose we are. Good. Have a good night. You go to my head Like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew And I find the very mention of you Like the kicker in a julep or two The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought To my plea casts a spell over me Still I say to myself Get a hold of yourself Can't you see that it never can be You go to my head With a smile that makes my temperature rise Like a summer with a thousand Julys You intoxicate my soul with your eyes Though I'm certain that this heart of mine Hasn't a ghost of a chance In this crazy romance - Oh, you go to my head - You go to my head You go To my head I should go. Why? Because we almost kissed? We didn't almost kiss. We were just in the moment of the song. It's nothing personal. Oh, come on. Everything is personal with you. Oh! Is everything so simple to you? "That's a waste of time". "It's personal". Does everything become black and white when you have money? - Can you tell me that? - I guess I tend to think in absolutes. My life isn't like that, Nate. Well, tell me what it's like, then. No, thank you. Right. Is there anyone you can tell? - Huh? - Fine. I'm in love with somebody who doesn't love themselves, so it makes it hard for them to love me. And every day, because I love this person, I lower my expectations until just getting him to sit upright and be alert is... a really good day. Actually, I think I know how that feels. Yeah, of course you do. I'm sorry. You don't know me either. Let's just keep it like that, okay? On the night that Frank D. showed up to hear me sing, my piano player didn't. And I can't afford to lose that gig. And you want me to help? Yeah. It's, um... on Wednesday night. And it's late, so... Right. What's the big deal? I... I don't play out. Why not? I thought you said you wanted to play music together. No, it's not about that. I... I don't like performing. Can you make an exception? One night. Three songs. And what happens after that? Well, then Frank D. gives me a gig at The House, and I play with him. Oh. Frank D.'s coming. Right. Well, that's why I came here 'cause I already blew it with Frank D. But I figured he was your friend and he'd show up to hear you play. You figured? Yeah. Still personal? That's just not gonna work for me. I can't. Oh, come on. I thought you wanted to play music together. Of course I wanna play music together, but I don't wanna be in a position where I'm playing music for the benefit of someone else. Especially not Frank D. The guy doesn't even know that I play, and that's the way I wanna keep it. I can't believe that you don't get this. Music is a gift. Don't start with that, please. When somebody plays, when Frank D. plays, he is giving you a piece of his soul, and the greatest thing is to be able to give that right back to him. I've given back to Frank D. more than a few times. With what, financial advice? Is that what your soul is made up of? Is it? What if it is? Then I'm sure you're very good at what you do. Fool that I am - For falling... - falling in love with you And fool that I am For thinking you love me too You took my heart Then played the part of little coquette And all my dreams just disappeared... just disappeared In all the smoke from our cigarettes, oh Fool that I am For hoping you'd understand And thinking you would listen to All the things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye Darling, this is goodbye But I still care - Crazy little fool that I am - What a fool I am It's clear there are gonna be cash-flow problems. Yeah, I suppose. I guess I'm not sure they can't weather the storm. May I just point out to you that Cytek is just as vulnerable as Sunset-Western and DEK, both of which are on the board. Nate? Nate, Angelica. Someone you might want to say hello to. You remember Marie Devrenier. Yes. We've met before. Nice to see you again. Likewise. Miss Devrenier is here on behalf of her father, Robert Devrenier. CEO of Duocon. Well, he must hate us. He's over it. But now he'd like to take his personal investments... in a new direction. Which would be you, Nate. If you're free this evening, I'd like you to take Miss Devrenier to dinner and convince her that her father's money should be with us. I'm sorry for the short notice, but my father likes to wrap things up quickly, and I'm headed out of the country tomorrow for the next two weeks. Sure, sure. You're still ahead of schedule on the Beretsky plan, right? - Uh, well... - Yes, we're ahead of schedule. Good. Then you're free. I'll leave you two to iron out the details. Uh, Marie, this is Angelica Webster. - Pleasure to meet you. - How do you do? Uh, just leave it open, thank you. - Angelica, it's fine. - Why be fine when you can be perfect? She's a beautiful girl. And smart. I don't know why you're not more excited. - You could use a woman in your life. - Debatable. - Oh, come on. - I'm just not in the mood. Well, find a way to get there. Devrenier would be a huge client. This girl could be the key to your future. So... do the right thing. Which is what, exactly? Make her happy. Go on. I'll take those. Here. You just keep this part, and I will, uh... - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay, great, great. - Let's sit over here. - I want to talk to you. - Huh? I'm sorry. - I want to talk to you! - Sorry, I can't hear you. Hey, come on. Let's go. - Here. Ticket. - Thank you. Just bring it back later. Band is gonna take a short break. They'll be right back. Yeah, the band was great. This is great, guys. So, Nate... tell us. Come on, please. Stop with the questions, you guys. Sorry. We're all a little fascinated by you. Yeah, we were all there for "the rejection". - Rejection? - Oh, come on. You remember. - Oh, that. - Right. That doesn't happen to Marie. Ever. What were you thinking? Well, I was thinking... what a horrible mistake I was making. Right. Smart boy. Here's to that. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. Great glasses. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Have a good night. - You, too. Hey. Ticket. - Why are you so upset? - I'm not upset. - She's a client. - Who's a client? - The woman I'm with. - You're with a woman? Very funny. Look, I need to talk to you about last night. Please, no more talking. It's exhausting. - Hey, you ready to go? - Ticket? Yeah, ready. I'll see you guys later. Okay, huh? You two have a good time. Here you go. Have a good night. Yeah, nice meeting you. Next. Hi. What do you think? Is this supposed to prove a point? No. I thought it might be a nice play-out on Wednesday night. I was trying to tell you at The House, but you were too busy not being upset. - How's your client? - I dropped her off. So, you like the music or not? Well, it's not how I would have done it. So? So, I don't know. You can't expect me to just instantly like something that's not what I've been imagining. Sorry. When you figure it out, you know where I live. Wait. Will you play it for me? Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. Thank you. Why do I let you do the things you do 'Cause, baby, when it comes to you I should know better Once upon a time your love was my great passion Shined just like the colors of a rainbow Happiness Ours for the asking I remember when you loved me And then I looked around And without a sound Love is gone Still I can't let go I keep holding on When I know I should go Why do I let you do the things you do - Things you do - 'Cause, baby - when it comes to you - 'Cause, baby, when it comes to you I should know better Once upon a time your love was my great passion Shined just like the colors of a rainbow Happiness Ours for the asking I remember when you loved me Then I looked around And without a sound Love is gone Still I can't let go I keep holding on When I know I should go Yeah. That's just about it. I mean... the bridge could probably use a little bit of work, but otherwise it's... What do you think? It's in pretty good shape, right? I didn't make a hard copy of that. Good. I wanna go long with Beretsky's investments. - You what? - I spent the entire night thinking about what we've been doing here, Angelica, and I'm tired of it. Do I really want to spend my entire life finding failure? No. But, Nate, it's what we do. We sell short. We're good at it. Maybe it's time we got good at something else. I don't think it's time. We're a couple of days away from finishing a $40-million portfolio. Now is definitely not the time to go back to square one. I know I'm pulling the rug out from underneath you here, but I wanna do this, and I want you to do it with me. Okay. I want you to tell me what's going on. - Angelica... - You don't just wake up one morning and decide that everything you've been doing for the past 5 years is wrong! Well, how else does it happen? I don't know! You haven't been yourself since your mom's house was broken into! - Aw, come on... - I was concerned about you then. You told me not to worry, and I tried not to, and now look! - This is totally reckless. - Well, maybe it is. Maybe I'm losing my mind. I don't know, but... it just can't be any other way. You're my best friend. I love you. Let's do this. Just stop it! - Angelica? - Stop it! We'll start with Buchanan's newsletter. He's an optimist, but he's not blind to reality. - I'll get the last three months. - Good. And I love you, too. Yeah, right away, please. I think so. What have I got for you? Well, how about Hil-Co? No, I'm not joking. Five years' time, they'll be swatting everybody else away like flies. These are the stocks I'd bet on for the long term. I know what I said before, but I don't care. I'm over it. Okay, yeah, I trust you. You're right. Explain how I'm supposed to feel comfortable buying a stock that just last week you told us to sell short? Look, it's simply a question of perspective. That's right. What do you say you return the favor? All right, what do you got? Sixty-six and one-eighth. January, right. Now I have a favor to ask you. Up three points? Up three points. No, that's driven them up, right? No, it's going up. Up. Yeah. - We did it! - We did it. They're solid investments, Paul. That isn't really the point. The point is Carl Beretsky bought into a strategy of short-selling, and you're giving him something completely different. In fact, you're giving him the opposite. With all due respect, Mr. Holtzman, Beretsky didn't buy into a strategy. He bought into Nate. He was worried about his financial security, and Nate gave him hope. I doubt he really cares what we do with the money as long as it grows. It's not that simple, Angelica. I have to tell Carl we completely reversed the field. He could fly off the handle and pull all his money. Not if you believe in the plan yourself. With all due respect, your number one man did all the work. All you have to do is trust him. How easy is that? You were amazing. That speech was inspirational. Now that we've got the basics ironed out, we ought to talk about some designations for Beretsky's general fund. I had ideas for creating tax protection I wanted to run by you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. We've been working our butts off for weeks. You know what? I want you to take the day off. Don't be silly. There's plenty of work to do here. I'm taking the day off. I want you to do the same. Well, what are you gonna do? Hello. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, Angelica, this is Chloe. Hi. It's really nice to meet you. Likewise. They're, um, fancy digs. Would you like the 25-cent tour before you two go? Oh, thank you. I would like that. - Yes, thank you. - Okay. Let's go. Wow, you guys work here? Sometimes. Oh, my... Is there no nonfat milk in this place? Shee. I don't know why but I'm feelin' so sad I long to try somethin' I've never had Never had no kissin' Mmm, what I been missin' Lover man, oh where can you be That's for you. Come on. Sit down. The night is so cold - Yeah? - I didn't know that. And I'm so all alone I'd give my soul Just to call you my own Oh! My heart. Got a moon above me But no one to love me Lover man, oh where can you be I've heard it said That the thrill of romance can be A heavenly dream - What do you think? - Oh. Hmm. Well. A new man? One day we'll meet Thank you. And you'll dry all my tears And whisper sweet little things in my ears Huggin' and a-kissin' Mmm, what we've been missin' Lover man, oh where can you Be You still want "A" flat, right? Yeah. Give me a hand up? Thanks. Hi. Welcome to the Last Stop. Hit it. Here I go again I hear those trumpets blow again All aglow again Taking a chance on love Here I slide again About to take that ride again So starry-eyed again Taking a chance on love I thought that cards were a frame-up I never would try But now I'm taking that game up And the ace of hearts is high, oh Things are mending now I see a rainbow blending now We'll have our happy ending now Taking a chance on love Taking a chance on love Thank you. Yeah, sorry. They were friends. You know what I'm worried about? Now that you're gonna be singing with me, I have to bring my "A" game every night. - Yeah, Frank, no more slackin' off. - Well, here's to the "A" game. - Cheers. - Cheers. And, you, I don't even know you anymore. - You want a gig, too? - No, Frank, I'm retiring. Goin' out on top. Well, you're gonna have to come play a duet with me sometime. You're not just gonna sit there. - Yeah. - All right. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yay! - Alright, alright, alright. - Cheers. - That'd be great. - Cheers. - Cheers. But I don't want you singing. You just stick to the organ, Frank. Okay? Mmm... You're like a piano. Play something on me. Like what? I don't know. You choose. Okay. What is that? Schubert. Mmm. It's wonderful. My mother used to play this every time she sat down to practice. Which was right about the time I got home from school. So... I must have heard that hundreds of times. Used to hate it. Now it's what I think about every time I look at a piano. Mmm. Do you miss her? I wish she hadn't died unhappy. If I could figure that out, that would probably lead me to knowing whether I miss her or not. I... Well, that's a pretty complicated answer for somebody who thinks in absolutes. Well, I thought I had everything figured out. And then I met you. Holtzman's been here for 3 hours. This doesn't look good. - Good morning. - I've gone over everything. About half of Beretsky's portfolio can absorb some overall market damage. The other half I would classify as vulnerable. - Mm-hmm. - We have two options: short anything that gets an initial uptick, or we just dump everything right away and start again once the market's stabilized. What do you wanna do? We don't have a lot of time. Well... I think we should just ride it out. Ride it out. Are you kidding? No. I like this portfolio for the long term. Nate, you're gonna lose his money! We need to sell everything in the Beretsky portfolio as soon as the market opens. I'm not gonna do that, Paul. Excuse me? I'm not going to give up on a good thing because I'm scared that something bad might happen. I believe in the stocks we chose. I don't have time to get into this with you right now, but we have 40 million dollars... tied up in a market that's about to crash. So if you don't mind... You don't know that, and even if it does, this portfolio can withstand... Beretsky will lose half his money by noon! And I can't withstand that! So just dump the damn stocks! Or I'll find somebody who will. You better start looking, Paul. - You got five minutes. - Stop it! You made your point! It's not about making a point. I am not going to be bullied into doing something I do not believe in. That's fine. I'll sell the Beretsky portfolio. You clear out your desk. You're fired. Excellent. Mr. Holtzman, wait. I haven't got time to wait! Mr. Holtzman! Aw, come on. Angelica, let him go. It's okay! Hi. No, it's okay. You don't have to be afraid of me. I'm-I'm here to help. I don't need any help. Well, I'm here to help Jesse. I don't know where Jesse is. Well, I do. He's in the bedroom. I would give it a couple of hours. It's not really a good time right now. What did you do to him? Who are you? No... I'm Vince. Jesse didn't tell you about me, did he? No. I'm the guy people call when... when they can't get clean. Call me tomorrow. Holtzman will have cooled off by then. - I'm sure I can get him to reconsider. - Don't bother. Nate, you need this job. You need it so that you eventually have the leverage... to start something for yourself. I already have started something for myself. Finally. And... I have all the leverage I need. Seeing as Holtzman had to have the last word, I should get a pretty good severance. That's not gonna last forever. Well... who knows? Call me! Life's gonna be pretty simple for Jesse. He's gonna have two kinds of people. People that help him stay clean, and people that don't. It's your choice. It is your choice. I haven't seen Jesse for a few weeks, and I didn't know... when he was coming back. And, um... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Um... You were already gone, weren't you? You're already outta here. Yeah. Oh... I'm sorry. I should have said this from the beginning. You don't have to do this. You don't. Can I help you? Uh, I'm looking for Chloe. Is she here at all? Chloe's not available right now. Can I give her a message? Is she here or... not? She's here, but she's not available. Is there a message I can give her? Yeah, just tell her Nate dropped by, I guess. Nate. Okay, Nate. I'll tell her. All right? Thanks. Nate? Hey. What's going on? I'm going to explain. Um... You wanna grab some breakfast? I need to talk to you, too. No, I, um... I have to stay here. What's the matter? Um, that man that you met upstairs is here to help us get Jesse clean. "Us"? Yeah, Jesse and me. He came back last night. Um, and the next few days are supposed to be kind of crazy, so Vince is gonna hang around for a couple of days and make sure that nothing bad happens to Jesse. What about you? I'm-I'm going to help. Oh, Chloe. It's not what you're thinking. - You're doing what we always do. - No, I'm not. Yes, you are! You just can't see it! If you had a chance to go back right now and try to help your mom, you would do it no matter how bad the odds were. That's different. That's totally different. That's only because it's too late. I'm sorry. The thrill is gone The thrill is gone I can see it In your eyes I can hear it In your sigh Feel your touch and realize The thrill is gone - I'll get Vince. - Stay. This is the end Jesse? So I pretend And let it linger It's gonna be one hell of a write-off. Here's your receipt. On The thrill is gone So, you know, basically I'm just exploring my options right now, figuring out what I'm gonna do. There's no rush, right? Did you quit, or were you fired? Which one was it, 'cause I'm not totally clear on that. Uh, uh, I quit. Well, you know, for all intents and purposes, I quit. Right. Ah. Hey, Nate, it's Frank. I haven't seen you around The House lately. Where you been? Where's that gig you promised me? Give me a call. Why do I let you do the things you do 'Cause, baby, when it comes to you I should know better Once upon a time your love was my great passion Shined just like the colors of a rainbow Happiness Ours for the asking I remember when you loved me Then I looked around And without a sound Love is gone Still I can't let go I keep holding on When I know I should go - Up. - Uh, what... What is... What's that? What's what? It's soup. Not the sou... The tune you're humming. What is that? Oh. Was I humming? Yeah. Oh. You didn't know you were humming? No, I didn't know I was humming. I knew you were humming. Mmm. - You know, I was thinking... - Don't think. Eat. I'm serious. I was... I was thinking we should get outta here. Are you sure you're up for that? No, I mean, um... "out of here" out of here. I can't be in this city anymore, Chloe. It's not healthy. I wanna go somewhere else and start all over. The right way. With you. My little lady. What do you think? Um... What's new How did that romance Come through What'd you expect? You don't return any of my phone calls. Super let me in. He mentioned, by the way, he loves what you're doing with the place, and I have to agree. As good as that looks, I... I'll just stick to my glass of wine, but thanks for the offer. What, are you mad at me? I'm on your side. I'm not mad at you. I'm just... I don't have anything left inside of me. I don't have the energy to return my phone calls or... sit on the couch and talk about what's going on in my life. Sorry. It's the girl. You know, when we met, I thought there was something so familiar about her. I couldn't figure it out, and then just last night, it occurred to me how much she reminded me of your mom. That's ridiculous. She does. You remember your mom. Before she got depressed, she had that same sunny, optimist... Of course I remember! I moved on! You should be trying to do the same thing, Angelica. You're not exactly young anymore. Maybe you should sit down and try to figure out what's really going on in your life, what you're going to do, instead of just playing my wet nurse. Everybody deals with heartbreak in their own way. Some people drink. Some people eat sweets. You... you just push away everything you love. And everybody, too. - Hello. - Hi. - Just one. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Thank you. Thank you very much. We're gonna take a short intermission. We'll be right back. Hey, Frank. How ya doin'? - Nate, how ya doin'? - Good to see you. - Sounding pretty sharp up there. - Thank you, thank you. Yeah. Frank, what? I did what I had to do, and that's that. I'll be fine, okay? I'll find something else. All's I'm sayin' is you could have thought of me before you did something rash. I have a feeling you'll be okay. Ah, anyway, it's good to see that you're back. - Cheers. - Cheers. So what's the plan? I'm not sure. Look, have you seen Chloe at all? No. That girl, she just vanished. Anyway, I hope you've been practicing. I got you booked here for next Wednesday. This is Nate Holden. Please leave a message. Nate, it's Angelica. Forget about the other night. There's a new firm looking for a partner, and they're asking for you. Hello. Hi. No, look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. No, I really appreciate it, Angelica. I do. Wait a minute. Who? The crash. The crash was really more of a fender bender. It had a healthy rebound. All I did was reinvest Beretsky's funds into what pretty much amounted to the portfolio you created. It went up 12 percent. And this... this I've been planning for quite some time. But it was your investments that gave me the push I needed to make it happen. I mean, you and I together, I mean, we could make an incredibly strong team. And I know Beretsky feels the same way. The only question is... how do you feel? - How'd it go? - Incredibly well. Now, would you meet me... at this address tonight? Here. What is this? And in the meantime, David wants to see you. - What for? - Just go on in. He's waiting for you. Me? You're gonna be great. Go on. He's expecting me. Why do I let you do the... - Hey. - Hi. Did you, um, finish up in there? Does, um, that have anything to do with this sheet music? You, um, love him? Jesse... You know, it's funny when... I mean, when you think you've lost everything, you find out you can, um, always lose a little more. Hey... Thank you very much. Thank you. At this time, I'd like to bring a very special guest up, personal friend of mine, Mr. Nate Holden. Ladies and gentlemen, please make him feel welcome. It's his first time here at The House. Thank... Excuse me. Thank you. Hey. Angelica? Hi. Oh! - What a pleasure to meet you. - Hi. Pleased to meet you. If the nightingales could sing like you They'd sing much sweeter than they do For you brought a new kind of love - to me - Hello, let's hear it for Chloe! Microphone. Yeah. And if the sandman brought me dreams of you I'd want to dream my whole life through 'Cause you brought a new kind of love to me I know that I'm the queen, you're the king Still you can understand That underneath it all I'm a girl And you, you're only a man I would work and slave my whole life through If I could hurry home to you 'Cause you brought a new kind of love to me Yeah. You brought a new kind of love I love you. I love you, too. Love walked right in and drove the shadows away Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day One magic moment and my heart seemed to know That love said hello Though not a word was spoken One look and I forgot the gloom of the past One look and I had found my future at last One look and I had found a world completely new When love walked in with you Love walked right in and drove the shadows away Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day One magic moment and my heart seemed to know That love said hello Though not a word was spoken One look and I forgot the gloom of the past One look and I had found my future at last One look and I had found a world completely new When love walked in with you
