'Varsha is dead!' 'Her son is also dead!' 'They died because of you.' 'I wanted to talk about something important.' 'Are you listening Ajay.' 'I am worried.' 'Balwant Rai.' 'Is anybody listening?' 'They killed my brother.' 'Is anyone listening?' Ajay, the medicine is right in front of you and you...! Take it. Stop playing with your memories, Ajay. These moments that you tq/ to recall with your dear ones.. Just stop it! The nightmares that come with them will take you somewhere from where.. ...no neurologist will be able to bring you back, let alone me. You know that your life isn't just yours anymore, right? You killed her, right? Confess it. You raped her. Confess it. You did it, right? Tell me. I killed her. I killed her. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Ajay, he is Inspector Pawar.

Ajay Mehra, you bastard! You bastard! Who the hell do you think you are? You want to mess with me? With Aditya Rajguru? You will mess with the Daily Herald? After a few exposs, you think you are someone great? You think you are a media mogul? These RTA activists, retired police officers. You think you can challenge me with the help of these clowns? You wanna mess with me! You... Your mother is a woman. Your wife is a woman. A daughten. A sisten. Do you recognize her? Read it. 'Papa, I thought...' '...l'll come to Mumbai, get ajob and support you.' I'll become ajournalist and be the voice of all the girls in this countw. But my boss Aditya Rajguru.. '...who is exactly your age.' Killed my voice. 'He took advantage of my trust.' 'He raped...' 'I don't want to live anymore, papa.' 'How will I ever face you, or my fianc Shrikant?' 'I am sorry, P3P3-' 'Please forgive me.' What does this prove? I didn't kill her. Docton. Between a rapist and an innocent boy's DNA.. There is a difference, right? Sorw, sir. Please forgive me. The three suspects of reporter Renu Sharma's rape. First: The owner of the Daily Herald, the rapist, Aditya Rajguru. The entire countw is shocked by the shameful deed of such high-profiled socialites. Dr. Poonawala. Instead of Rajguru's DNA sample... ...he presented Renu's boyfriend Srikanfs sample. ...and made a false report. Police commissioner Saurabh Sinha. He destroyed all the evidences. He tortured SrikanL. And forced him to confess. That he raped Renu Sharma. S.l. Pawar was instrumental in Ajay Mehra's unraveling of the case. This is the biggest and most Sensational expose done by Mr. Ajay Mehra. He had torn the suicide note on being pressurized by his seniors. But later S.l. Pawar realized" That he too has a daughter. Ajay Mehra has done it again. How does he do it time and again? - May Ajay Mehra Iivelong. We will disclose this secret in some time. - So that our daughters stay safe. This was Mumbai police'sjob, but Ajay Mehra did it. Ajay Mehra should also be in Delhi. Only then will our girls be safe. I will regain the trust people have lost in Mumbai police. 'We used to give sleepless nights... ...and now Ajay Mehra has done the same to us.' 'Our boss has been arrested...' '...but keep listening to Radio Herald uninterrupted.' The market today opened with Herald shares. "Taking a 47% dip in the value. Experts are predicting a further fall ahead. That's great. Dad, Herald media group is now ours. That's good, Kabir. Wow! Butter chicken! Ajay Mehra... That's why you are my favorite doctor, Ms. Riya. Because you know how to keep your patients happy. Well done, my boy. JOe! What are you doing? Meet them. Hello. - Hello. Hi, dear. Ajay! I am feeling so proud of you. Come, come, come. Evew woman in this world must be praying for you today. Wonderful. Let him eat. It's okay to have it sometimes. Sometimes? He eats it evew day. Hey! Sir, what's the progress of Nanded's case? Did RTA reply? Yes. I had to go there as well. I asked the principal to come along" ...we would work as well as romance a little. Romance? - So? Eat. You should go with him. Long drives, outings. Don't listen to him, Riya. He always has a hidden agenda. Last time he took my friends with him to Latur for an outing. Once there, he parked the car outside the collectorate. ...he gave us some plank cards to hold.. "And asked us if we could protest with him for a while. I was so embarrassed. What are you saying? - Yeah. Did you really do that? I killed her. - She is lying. - What? I humbly asked them whether they could protest for a while. They rudely said "no"! I said fine. - I won't let anything happen to you. Trust me. I killed her, mother. I killed her. As you can see Srikant who was excruciated by the police.. "Has lost his mental balance completely. You can see that he is vew scared. And that police has tortured him a lot. I killed her. - You didn't do anything. I killed her. L.. I killed her. - I am right here with you. L.. I killed her. L.. I killed her. Renu.. Renu.. - Yes? Renu.. you are here! - Just relax. I have been twing to explain it to them.. Lie down. I didn't kill you. - Nothing will happen to you. I didn't kill you. You are not Renu. - Just relax. Where is Renu? Where is Renu? You are not Renu! Where is Renu? Relax Shrikant. I want Renu! Renu! He'll get 10 more electric shocks? It's not electric shocks. It's a therapy which is vew important for him. Look at Ajay. His case was vew serious. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. Kill me. Let me die. Die. I want to die. Kill me. Kill me. I want to die. Kill me. Kill me. Be careful. Calm down. Are you feeling all right? Ajay? - Vars h a? Relax, Ajay. - You are not Varsha. Ward boys! - You are not Varsha. Prepare the E.C.T. - 'Varsha! I want to go to Varsha' Relax. 'I want to die. I want to go to Varsha' After the death of his wife and kids, he turned suicidal. But look at him now. He is absolutely fine. Srikanfs case is not that serious. He will get well in a few months. But he can get well only when you and others. "That is, his friends and family behave positively with him. We will need to give him a new aim. When he will get a new aim, his new life with begin. What are you thinking? Superintendent said that my term here is coming to an end. I will be released next year. What will I do once I go outside? The things which others can't do, Ajay. Not even/one has the strength to endure and to fight as you do. He is right, Ajay. And when we are with you then your aim is close by. An aim.. - Ajay.. Why don't we get out of here and help those who are helpless. Alone.. And feel defeated by the system. Ajay? They are leaving. Your son will get well. Just like me. We will always be grateful to you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Ajay, we're getting late. Shall we? Let me call on stage, Mr. Ajay Satyakant Mehra. He should come here and give the braveq/ award to these brave kids. I fell into the fast flowing water while doing river rafting" "but these stupid kids saved my life. Zoya Sehgal. Varun Jain. My son. Thank you. Thank you so much. - Rohan Kriplani. Yeah! Thank you. Thank you, sir. - Anushka Kulkarni. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Please share a few words with these kids.

Ajay, the accident that took place on Pen Highway... D'Souza sir's car was in it. Sir, there were 8-10 more people apart from Joe sir. And the tanker driver was also burnt to death. Ajay, sister-in-law.. JOe! JOe! I want to see Joe. 0h, my God! JOe! Joe! No, Joe! No, Joe! Joe! My Joe! I want to go.. Let mejust see him once. Let me.. oh my God. - 'An Accident on Mumbai-Pen Highway.' We have got information that 8-10 died in this accident. Former deputy commissioner and RTI activist. 'This incident.' - Guys! Guys, he killed him. Joe D'Souza! - Who? The RTI activist. Kabir shot him. Shit, he killed him. Shit. I was watching this and suddenly the.. - What happened? - Look at this grandpa. Raj Bansal. And that's Kaka Sahib, that's the home minister. - Shit. I am going to blog this right now No, Zoya. - Why? It will take only two seconds to trace its IP address. Exactly. - Shit. We should give it to the police. Have you lost your mind? The home minister himself is involved in this. Ajay Mehra. We need to take this to Ajay Mehra. - No! No Ajay Mehra. No! No one will tell anything to anyone. You guys don't know anything. Come with me. This is the biggest ever road accident on Mumbai-Pen Highway so far. 8-10 people are believed to have died in it. What? You saw that? - Former deputy commissioner and RTI activist. Are you getting it? They turned a murder into an accident. They killed 8-10 people. These images might disturb you. - Rohan, call up your father. And ask him to come here immediately. Yeah, my dad. It's clear that the Pen Highway accident in which our founder... ...and other 10 people died.. "Happened due to the mistake of the tanker driver.. ...and road department's mismanagement. - Vew good. Satyakam family prays for Joe D'Souza and" Mr. BansaL. good riddance. Troy is just great. He killed 11 people along with D'Souza. That made the accident quite convincing. And the way Satyakam confirmed it.. Now I am relaxed. I am relaxed. - Good night. 'You socialist rats!' 'Bloody anarchists!' 'What is your contribution in this countq/'s growth? 'We are the ones who create wealth.' 'We are the ones who provide employment.' 'We are the ones who are feeling you all.' 'You always create hurdles for us.' 'All of you should die.' 'And lwill kill all ofyou.' Where is papa? Over there. Ananya! - Ananya! Slow down, dear. Papa! Look at this, papa. Mom got an award. I, too, went on the stage. Why didn't you come here? Dear, I was. Prema.. Ananya, you have to go to school in the morning. Say good night to even/one. Good night, papa. - Good night. Good night, grandma. - Good night, dear. Good night, mom. Good night, Ananya. What's wrong, son? You look upset. Nothing, mother. lt'sjust.. You should go and rest. What is wrong, Raj? Actually, today, I realized that the huge empire that my dad built.. ...our legacy, our son won't be able to take it ahead. Why do you say that? I wish you could witness his anger today. He shot a man today. And the way he shot. Shot? What do you mean? What do you mean by shot? He killed someone? Yes. But the murder has been taken care of. What are you saying? - But the murder has been taken care of. I told you not to give him a gun. This is not about the gun. - I had told you.. Tomorrow he kills someone with his can. I will! I surely will! - Please tq/ to understand. I am shocked by the rage with which he killed that man. His attitude, his thoughts. How will he run such a big empire with so much anger? We have failed as parents. What kind of an upbringing have you given him? Me? - Yes, you. L.. - You are his mother. You never let me be a mother, Raj. I was just a nanny to your prince. I gave birth to him, but he got all his values from you. You didn't stop him when he insulted his elders or the sen/ants. You gave him even/thing he wanted. You made such a big Bansal world for prince.. ...that he thought that he has a right to anything and even/thing. You are responsible for it. You have made him a.. You have made him a murderer. This is even/thing? - Yes. - Yes, dad. There is nothing left behind with you? - No. You sure? - Yes, sir. Let's go. - Uncle.. But what are you going to do? Dear, you know that I am a lawyer, right? Yes. I will do what you want to do. But in my own way. Another thing: You won't mention this to anyone. Promise? - Yes, uncle. Yes, uncle. - Let's go. - Okay. Doomed. Oh damn.. What a piece of crap! This makes it look as if we are killing him on purpose. But it was not so. Well done, Kaka Sahib. You invited the vew person I came hereto complain about. Mr. D'Souza.. You've made a good name for yourself with your RTI applications. It's time to call it quits. Now it's time to join hands and move ahead. Kaka Sahib, how many times do I have to tell you.. I don't wear a uniform anymore. I am retired. Hence, I am no longer forced to follow your orders. I have instead gotten into a habit of following up. Look at this. 3452 families which you have ruined. Rehabilitate their homes, farms and animals and the problem is solved. Mr. D'Souza.. We have given them the compensation government has ordered us to. You haven't given them anything, you have fooled them. In exchange of a mere compensation, you've stolen the lands of those illiterate poor people. Come on, Mr. D'Souza. People will get employment because of the project. If they don't die due to stan/ation by then. Even/thing that we did was done with government approval. Which government are you talking about? The government that dances naked to your tunes? How dare you talk to my father like that, you rotten slave? What did you say? Leave me. - This is what your father wants to make us. Mr. D'Souza. - Leave me. The government too is your slave. - Leave me. Water, electricity, phone network" - Leave me.. Even/thing belongs to you. - Leave me or I'll kill you. Even/thing belongs to your father. The only thing left is his image on the currency. You are making this countm. Now do you understand? Yes. I completely understand. You are not at fault, son. It isjustified. Justified, he is. Joe D'Souza is such a man that this was bound to happen eventually. Hence, I brought even/thing over here. Mr. Kriplani, what do you mean to say? That you have not made any copies of it? What? What are you saying? You must have kept one for safety sake. You are accusing me. You are a lawyer. You are getting me wrong. l.. Look Mr. Raj, I am a corporate lawyer. You know me. I did all this" Kaka Sahib is making an accusation on me. Relax Kriplani. - I did all this for you. Relax. He is just reassuring. And I trust you. And I appreciate your gesture. - Thank you. Vew shortly, you will receive a call from my accounts department. No. Why are you taking it the wrong way? Look, you are getting it all wrong. I didn't do all this for the money. Mr. Kriplani, control yourself. No, no. Mr. Kriplani, please. This is the reason I brought all these things with me. - Calm down. I spoke about the moneyjust as a good gesture on our part. No, I don't want any money. You don't have to worw about anything. Please relax. - Mr. Kriplani.. I hope you don't mind sharing a few details of those four kids with us. They won't utter a word about this to anyone, sir. Mr. Kriplani, Troy is our security chief. - Okay. It's just a regular security drill. You don't need to feel scared. Like you said, my son is just like your own son.. - Absolutely. Similarly, your son is my life my own son. Okay, relax. Yeah? Thank you. Thank you vew much. Thank you. This gull-- He is too funny. Kabir.. I'm damned" Stop worming about your son. We will have to stay alert now. You know why no one has ever touched D'Souza? Because he had Ajay Mehra's support. He is vew stubborn. You don't know what kind of a person Ajay Mehra is. Balwant Rai was once where you are now. He killed Ajay Mehra's brother. The entire Mumbai police, D'Souza and his men provided him security. But no one was able to stop Ajay Mehra. He gave him 24 hours. He went inside Balwant Rai's house and shot him. And he also killed all those who were with him. He killed all of them. He is a crazy stubborn guy. Mr. Bansal, he killed even/one. Did you hear me? You don't know what Ajay Mehra is. Who is this Ajay Mehra? I am thinking about my son and you are talking about Ajay Mehra. Who the hell is this Ajay Mehra? 'Why are you staring?' 'Honesty never dies.' 'When a corrupt person dies, his rein ends.' 'But when an honest man dies, his rein begins.' 'Satyakams never dies.' Morning, mom. Morning, dad. - Good morning. See you in court. - Sure, sir. Morning. Dad, what did you do with that video? I mean what's the progress? My friends were asking" "as we haven't heard any news about them getting arrested $0.. Eat this. - Yes, I'll eat it. So what's the progress, dad? Rohan, the progress is that I have made all of you safe. Safe? - And I am sure, this is what other parents wanted as well. Aren't you getting late? - Yes. Let's go. Dad? Dad! Dad, wait! Rohan.. - But what does making us safe mean? I gave the video to the ones to whom it belonged. Kabir Bansal murdered Mr. D'Souza. And you gave the evidence to him? Rohan, it's" - Dad.. dad, he is wrong. What is wrong? Is it wrong to be a father? Is it wrong to save your family? No, dad. But it wrong to be scared of the wrong people. And you are a lawyer! You stand for truth and justice. Truth and justice? You know what is truth and justice today? Today truth and justice is Raj Bansal. Raj Bansal, today, is truth and justice! He must be having his own reasons, Rohan. He must be genuinely afraid of Mr. Bansal. He's a powerful man. Anushka is right, Rohan. How is she right? If a lawyer of his stature cannot bring justice to someone" ...then how can a common man hope for anything in this countw? And our parents are so duplicitous. They teach us one thing and they do something just the opposite. Pretending parents. - What? Pretending parents. You are right, Zoya. Pretending parents. That day we should have given that video to Ajay Mehra. Then what are you waiting for? I have taken a backup of that video. Zoya? When? How did you do it? What are we waiting for? Let's go. He will now stay in the militaq/ academy, mother. L'm the one who spoilt him, so I'll be the one who will get him back on track. No. - Call him again. You have a problem bending before your elders as well? Touch her feet properly. Go on. Your manners help you win the world and not your ego. He is not answering it? Yes, Zoya? Hello, Alnoor sir.. Can I please speak to Ajay Mehra? Any emergency? Sir, Joe D'Souza didn't die in an accident. He was murdered. What? And we have the evidence. - Are you sure? Yes, sir. Can we please talk to Ajay Mehra? Troy, kids have a copy of the evidence. And they are going to Ajay Mehra. Copy that. Mr. Bansal, the kids have the copy of the evidence. And they have made contact with Ajay Mehra. Ajay.. There is an emergency. Hello, Zoya.. - Sir! Ajay sir! Raj BansaPs son, Kabir Bansal murdered him. We have the proof, sir. What? Whose murder? We went to Karnala bird sanctuaw to make a documentaw. One of our cameras captured Kabir Bansal shooting at Joe D'Souza. Our home minister Kaka Sahib and Raj Bansal were also present there. Do you know what you are saying? Are you sure about it? Yes, sir. We have the proof. This incident took place in a farmhouse in Karnala. Where are you? In college, sir. Hello, sir, I am Rohan. Rohan, do you know where my office is? Yes, sir. - Go there. I'm coming here. O K3Y- Let's go. Let's go, guys. Call Kaka Sahib and Kriplani as well. - Yes, sir. What's happening, Raj?

Just make sure that Kabir stays unharmed. I don't let any harm come to my son. Don't worw, Sheetal. - Zoya is at Pedar Road. And we are here. Joshi, what are you waiting for?

Another copy of that video has showed up. The kids are going to give it to Ajay Mehra. Why are you putting me in a fix? Just shut up. Just do as I say.
