The centuries killing black Jews not registered. - Are you hurt? - It is the blood of a dog. It is no longer a difference. There must have a means of escape. There is one. Join the Zionists. They have the solution. No, excuse me, but I am neither Zionist nor socialist, and practice neither politics nor religion. Describe what a horse is not explains what it is. Anyone who needs the description a horse is shortsighted. But if our papers are in order, we can move freely, even in Christian neighborhoods? The law is too simple to be credible. A rich Jew can live and work wherever he wants. You must be rich. You are properly installed. Nobody is poorer than me. I am a tailor. God bless my father who taught me the trade! Like all poor, I live and work in the ghetto. However ... pay kopecks goods Christian out of the ghetto, it is possible, why not? In Kiev, there was no difference between Jews kopecks rubles or circumcised. It was like the shtetl. The village. I saw a sign. He said: "Death to the revolution the Jewish people. " When did it start? They are out of kilter. Everything is madness. Think about it. To the revolution, we need a country. Do you know a single Jew, considers that this dirty country like hers? Shmocks! Do their civil war! Let us avoid the revolution at all costs. They do not expect it. Good night. It's even worse here in the village. The village? You sound like a goy. Is a shtetl shtetl. You want a piece? With pleasure. I walked all day. I have repaired a window. It's better than nothing. You complain to a man with 5 children and has more misery that Job himself. Thank God for your children. For me ... What interests me most, is to get rich. How do you I won today? Beans. A small plate. So clear soup a horsehair sank ... right at the bottom. Listen ... I'll give you some advice. So much for your rent but I prefer to be honest. A man like you should work outside. I can tell you, friends ... You do not even seem to be Jewish. Who decides who is a Jew? The goyim again. Try, you'll see. More we hide, the more we are forced to hide. It's like hunger. You need to have confidence. I'll tell you how. First of all ... take the air of a man busy who has no time to lose. At critical moments looking straight ahead. Raises the chin. Remember the promise to Abraham. And crossed the passage. you will spend for any Russian anti-Semitic and honest. People will look to sentencing. He's drunk. I should have guessed. Why you thought you on my way? I'm already quite suspect. Wake up. I do not to have you on the arm. You might as well die of cold, dirty anti-Semite. Dad, get up. Help me get him back. It is next. It has enough strength I'm busy. I should not have ... Dad gets home. Okay, go. Take his legs. This side. Lidya, Nataliya takes. You fell in the snow, Dad. This gentleman found you and saved his life. A faithful Christian. And a good Samaritan thank God! Sir ... Do not go so fast. Forgive my rudeness. That you just saved Nikolai Lebedev is Maximovich. I am his daughter, Zinaida Nikolaevna. If you want to return tomorrow morning you will receive something more "concrete" that thanks. "In more concrete"? She spoke of money ... I do not want a man which shows his hatred of Jews. But these anti-Semitic rubles allow a Jew to live. This is an argument. But before accepting I'll be frank. I tell him: "Nikolai Lebedev Maximovich, "This is me Yakov Bok Shepsovitch, "You have saved my life and I'm Jewish. "If you're not happy, keep your money. " What is your name? Yakov Ivanovich Dologushev. To be exact. Dologushev. Painter, roofer, carpenter, a bit of everything ... Lidya, Nataliya takes. I'm Nikolai Lebedev Maximovich. Sit down. I am an honest man. I'm really grateful to you. I'd be dead in the snow without your dedication. Others have ignored me. Christian charity is rare in this world, do not you think? I meet people charitable everywhere. This is not surprising your part. You read course the Scriptures? I know the psalms. Gorgeous! You hear, Zinaida? He knows the psalms. It is impossible read the Bible without getting ... crying. That is correct. The exact truth. He can not read without crying. Yes, every time. That's why I drink. I feel responsible all the world's ills. I carry on my shoulders all the sorrows of life. When Zinaida was small, I cried constantly because of its poor small withered leg. You know as well what kind of man you saved from death, last night. Yakov Ivanovich how do I pay you? I have an empty apartment above whose walls need to be redone. I will give you This is more than the normal wage. You are a man of honor, a job offer worth a tip. You do not believe? Obviously if. not a salary. This man is a member centuries of black. Daughter makes me uncomfortable. And his dog is the worst anti-Semitic. Would you have dinner with me when you're done? Dinner? Uh, no ... I have ... That is to say ... If you are bothered because of Dad he is so drunk the night that we must lie. I am forced to dine alone. It is intimate. But I feel alone. For solitude, reading is the best medicine. I do not have time to eat. I have another room to finish. It should be ready for tomorrow. Stay supper tomorrow then and if it is too late, you will sleep here. Pardon? You've distracted. Splendide! If I may so express myself, it is a true work of art. You're an impostor, I knew it. An impostor? You are presented as a simple worker, but I see that you are resourceful. And I intend to profit from it. There is little time I had the misfortune receive a brick inheritance. It is operated a boy competent but particularly dishonest responding on behalf of Proshko. I want it back on the right path you confident in accounting. The salary are 50 rubles per month, free housing the site of the brickworks. It is forbidden to stay there, but if the job is promising, buy fake papers and kiss the Cross. It's clever. I never papers. Childless, a man can not look anyone in the face. He lost his pride. As a woman, when her husband regrowth. Sleep with a woman sterile? I spent 5 years with you what it gave me? An empty bed. Raisl, whither goest thou? Find someone who loves me. And also ... Something concerns me even more. Girl! Why? She makes eyes. Sometimes you need to know sacrifices. Accept the job. Do you ... romance, Yakov Ivanovich? How? - Want herring? - Oh, no. But take it back in, please. At times ... I think that sometimes let love fly away. Like a cloud, a day of high winds. If you are a little too ... shy. As you can see ... after the appearance of this house, I'll never be penniless. That is certain. I know you and I we come from different backgrounds. What could make you doubt opportunities a lasting relationship. Even if you have the desire at heart. I've been cool. Yes, I see. Thank you. I thought ... it would be fair put you at ease. I love you, Yakov? Just a little. I'm sorry, Zinaida, I do not like you. But you do not lose anything. I am ignorant, indecisive and my uncertain future ... Yakov Ivanovich please. For heaven's sake, stop being so serious. Kiss Me. I defy you. I know my leg is ugly. But my face ... sometimes is nice. Often, I see that men notice me. Even young. Want to see my room? Forgive me ... to put it bluntly. If you are innocent, it is better not continue. Only mark of respect. In addition, we must think of your father. He would notice. He has never seen. Will you prepare my room is right there. With a Russian! This is ridiculous. If I told him that I was Jewish, she scream like a hunted animal. I can not do that. It is impossible. On the other hand, times are tough. Undressing in a goy in one of the most anti-Semitic must be sick! Too bad! I am a man, after all. Moreover, this would make him an insult. I wonder if it's worth the risk. At your age! As if it would be new! Surely not! For me, it has no interest. On the other hand, recklessness is already done. Why sneak into an orchard without fruit fly? But there is also this job. A little courage! Plow and the harvest will be good. My God, a cookie! Have you ever loved? Sincerely? Sincerely loved? You are impure! This is wrong, I assure you. Forgive me. I did not know your indisposition. So do I. It has just begun. Do not go. I could not know. Excuse me. There that can ... I do not. No, do not go. I beg you. Forgive me, Proshko. Really, I'm sorry. Here are the outputs you controlled. your account. We'll talk later. It's my job foreman to cover all papers by the police. Give yours. It is kind of you, but Nikolai Maximovich has already taken action. You know what? You do not speak as a worker, but as a boss. I bet 100 rubles you're a snitch. You count 68 Stop there! Stop, you hear? Do not come back! The bricks are worth money. Watch them. It is intelligent answer. Dologushev! You called me? Twice! You run like a pig hurt. Only a pig would see. "All these points ... "Enter human natural man ... "We can not abdicate even his own consent. " "Even his own consent ... "We can not abdicate those rights." A great man. A great thought. You do not become scientist copying the ideas of another. Who goes there? What has happened? I arrived in Minsk to visit my brother, in the ghetto. I lost my way. Boys have stoned me. I dragged far. By helping you, I compromise myself. You will leave tomorrow after the departure of carters. There is a tram just down the street. It goes straight to the ghetto. I'll give you to eat. Thank you ... but I can not accept. Would you mind give me some water? Passover. I'm Colonel Bodyansky, head of the secret police of Kiev. On behalf of Tsar Nicolas II, I arrest you. I am Boris Bibikov, judge, Log. Yakov Bok Shepsovitch. Jewish, of course. I should not have to hide, I agree. I've always admitted. I just determine the reason of your imprisonment and the duration of your stay. For this, I must collect information about you. Where is your family? Suffice to say that I do not. I lost my parents young. Are you going to the grave, the Jewish Day of Atonement? Anymore. They are dead. - Married with children? - No children. We tried, unsuccessfully, so I gave up. And to be honest ... she was not faithful to me. She left me for another. If it was not part I would have stayed in the village. At this precise moment, I would prepare supper. It could have been worse. On reflection, I was not there all bad. Do you know the expression "A historic need?" I have not received education. Maybe. But you speak correctly, not as a villager. Explain that to me. I tried to teach me, but I was hurt. I brought three books in Kiev including a grammar book and pronunciation. Your Business also concealed selected texts of Spinoza. You found my tools? These tools, this is my life. Of all the philosophers of this world, why Spinoza? Because he was Jewish? Not at all. I unfortunately accepted this book as payment. I unfortunately accepted this book as payment. When I started to read it, I could not get rid of. What do you think of his philosophy? It is hard for a single man ... I ask you because I also read Spinoza. He meant life is life. There is no need to think about death. It goes further than that. He taught us as free men must preserve the freedom of others. Am I right? If you say so. My philosophy of life has nothing to do with politics. What is your philosophy of life? Can improve things. Making policy! Politics it is for the rich. Everything would be better if there was more work. Besides the goodwill. I would like to see a lawyer. A cigarette? They are Turkish. If you were to give in your own words, a description of yourself, what would you say? I am myself. I am no longer young, but not yet old. I am ready to take me away, but quiet most of the time. At times ... I sometimes show me shy. I am not a coward. I may lack education, but I'm not completely stupid. In two words to summarize, I am a man, it is certainly not much but it's better than nothing. You talk to a lawyer. We must investigate. Then we will develop an indictment. At this time, you will see a lawyer. Do you understand? Fill out this questionnaire. And sign. I'll let the candle I must hurry. My little boy has asthma. What concerns my wife. Me too, actually. It's sad. I was also asthma. I wish I could relieve. Accommodate adults in better than children. Keeper! Whatever happens to you, cheer. The law will protect you. Unless you're guilty. Guilty of what? Sexual abuse against Miss Nikolaevna. This is false, Zinaida. I've not attacked. Silence! Sit down! He knows he's lying. He lunged at me with an air lewd and without clothes. When I screamed for him to escape, he fled. So you tried to rape her? It was not an attempted rape. She invited me in her room. I should not have. But I am a man. What harm has he? She was lying and pushed the sheet for me to join. This is false. He lies! Then? Some things are better not be repeated. What has happened when you joined? The truth is that ... The truth ... As always, no one knows afterthought. The truth is that ... She asked if I ever loved. At this time, a change occurred in me. I realized I liked that. At the thought of love lost I panicked. I ran as fast as possible, that's all. These are lies. I got him any proposal. He did anybody else. There is another reason. We do harclerons more. Semyonovich will take you home. Yakov Bok, under the circumstances, and without congratulate you for your conduct, I cancel the charge against you. God thank you! However, I will ask the court ... You are still charged to be domiciled in an area forbidden to the Jews, unless they have made service to the crown. This is not your case. No, I must admit. You will be charged and tried for committing an offense. His luck. Are you part these political organizations? Social democracy, Socialist Revolutionaries or any other group, league whose Jewish Zionists of all categories nihilistic or people's party? To save time, note that the defendant has already responded negatively. Everything is in its folder. You understand that my goal is not to save time. I take these revolutionary seriously. Time is irrelevant. Listen carefully my next question. What do the Jews by the word "afikomen"? This is a matzo you eat the Passover. That's the magic? For me, it would be superstition. This was in your room. It was an old man, a Hasid. But I do not know. He was lost, I left spend the night with me. Although Jewish. Jews do not fear nothing of their own. A little respect. This old you did he not help to prepare and cook the matzo? Not at all. Do you know this? The old man was shot in the head. I used my shirt to clean his blood. Approach. Tell me, Yakov Bok Shepsovitch, alias Yakov Ivanovich Dologushev, alias I do not know what yet ... Have you chased children? Among them, a 12 year old boy, Zhenia named Golov? It was found murdered shortly thereafter. You can see the photo right here. Well, Mr. Jew ... why are you trembling? It reduced the number of outputs for pocket money. The secret police confiscated If flying four rubles per day, it would make much more. Who knows what a Jew is his money? He had to buy sweets to attract children. They struggled to escape. When we found the body in the small cave, I searched his room. And I found the matzo, flour and soiled linen. This is it! Yes, that's him. What do you mean by "it"? The Jew who chased Zhenia with a knife. The accused has been identified. Can we enter Marfa? Tell us events before Passover. Speak slowly and clearly. Are you listening? Carefully. My son went to school as usual. I worked late. Zhenia was not at home when I returned. I thought he was at his grandmother. The same evening, I caught the flu. You know how it is. I had fever, I was sweating and vomited like a fountain. For three days, I remained bedridden. I was going to go to the police ... when it was found Zhenia body. With 39 stab wounds Jew in the body. My life is over. I lost my reason to live. They killed my baby! I'm mad. Why did you warned police so late? In my state? I was holding any liquid dgoulinais and everywhere. - I did not get up fast enough ... - Keep your story. You said the Jew Zhenia before his assassination? He told me that a Jew had chased with a knife. And he wanted to kill for good. My poor little Zhenia! He wanted to be ready. You I said, my father? He saw a jar of blood on the table of the Jew. I do not have a jar of blood! It's jam not blood! Silence! Tell him to drop his weapon. This man in handcuffs. We have our answers. I do not think ... I'll use my privilege and examine the witness. Why persecute sick? What have I done? We have no account to make us. Have you accepted stolen goods a band of thieves ... with your lover? Is it not true in January, you blinded by throwing phenol in the eyes? Then you are reconciled. He beat me. I had to defend myself. He tried to poke my eye. There was pus flowed. And besides ... As you said, I continue to see it. He swears by me. Is it not also true he beat your son so much the boy fainted? He killed my baby. He killed my poor little. Zhenia! He undressed the little and prayed over his body. Then he stabbed at specific locations. Thirteen stabbing in the core. Thirteen blows to the throat. Thirteen face. He collected his blood in vials while the small begged him and wept no more review the world of the living. You cry? I grieve for the child. Who else? You confess? I can not say I have not done. All seem to indicate ... you are a victim of the Jews as well as the child. The idea was to them, not you. Come on, admit it! We take into account the fact that you acted in spite of you. A man of your intelligence an open mind. You have been deceived, Yakov. You can not fool the innocent. No Jew could not kill this child. It's written everywhere: no blood. It's in the Bible, the Torah, laws, everywhere ... My wife threw eggs that yellow was stained with blood. I told him to be careful. We do not drove gold. She was a good cook, elsewhere. We ate well. Enough! We have evidence you killed the child and that you belong to the Kahal, Jewish secret organization, preparing a revolution to overthrow the Tsar. I'm not rvolutionnariste. Policy has never interested. I know nothing. Admit if you want to live. Otherwise, even God can do nothing for you. I do not have the talent to lie. Lie ... This is the only talent of the Jews. They are predictable and criminal nature. Everything has been scientifically proven. Get up! The Jewish nose ... And all are signs of crime. Here, this is yours. This is yours. It is the mind? Tell me, did not we learn respect to the Jews? Si What is it? It receives only if it has. I'll make you move in a cell preventive the Kiev prison. Mr. Attorney ... I've spent 5 months in prison. Mr. Bibikov said ... Crying on the shoulder of Bibikov, it does not change anything. I will make sure pourrissiez you in jail. You leave when you stop cover crimes these revolutionary and admit this vile conspiracy. A new one. You, I like you. You have soft skin and sacred mane. They will not have shaved heads? It's cute. You just snitch? Of course not. Kiss me. Slowly, my big. It has not been presented. It stinks Jew ... Hey, guys, we still sends a Jew. It is to me. You'll be my grandma, you have understood, dirty Yid? I know who you are. I, too, am a Jew. And then? Unlike you, I am guilty. Just for that, I admire you. This is more than I can say. What does it serve me? It frees me tomorrow. You want to write to someone? No, no. I do not want to violate any rules. I have enough trouble. My lawyer just me. I will pass your word. We do not search. Anyway, I have nothing to write. Take this. It is an honor share your cell. You are our martyrdom. Martyrdom in spite of myself. "Dear L. Latke ... "I do not want to get into trouble "A tailor penniless with five dependent children "And who suffer from rheumatism, "But I started in a dirty mess. "I am detained the prison in Kiev "Dorogozhitsky street. "I ask the impossible "But if you can help me, do it quickly. "Your former tenant, Yakov Bok." Why do you limp? I have shoes that are too tight. I hope you burn in hell. What do you expect? I forger. I have 5 young children and a mad woman. That's the kind of help you can expect your countrymen. This is a weak man. And in my eyes, a dead man. I run a great danger with my long hair. You distrust me. Wanna complain against aggression? I do not want to report. It should shave my head. This is the law! This is us who make the rules. We'll keep the hole until you confess, dirty bloodsucker! One must compare your footprint to that found in the small. The other prison has raised. But again. I need shoes. My feet are bleeding. The small also bled. If you want that you life easier, says. Go, search it. Undress! You've already searched Undress. Opens his mouth. Lean. Spread. The tub! Go ahead, open. Your friend Bibikov sent me to say you should confess. Excuse me, but every time, it's the same. You just when the director is absent. Opened! Please wait down the hall. And close the door. Your appearance betrays what you have endured. You will not see any disadvantage that I dodge the subject. I need to focus on another matter. Time is running out and I want to help you. So you also forgive my ways. I have nails in my shoes tear me feet. You'll get another pair. Would you like a cigarette? It would be a waste. My asthma has returned. You will excuse me. How's your boy? He died. What can you say to that? Nothing. Death has all the answers. Listen. I'm back from St. Petersburg. I asked Minister of Justice to drop the charges, except committing an offense. And .. What did he say? My dear Boris Alexandrovich, it is not so easy. After 9 months in jail for murder, how to charge for simple offense? - He should be released. - I agree with you. But the case became public and compromises our prestige. Confidentially Tsar believed guilty. It closely follows the file. The father's testimony Anastasy was particularly impressed. Anastasy father is a fanatic. It belongs to no religion nor church. I know. Tell the Tsar that the expert is a charlatan. Report to His Majesty Rasputin is a charlatan - What it is - and I will do the same about Anastasy. In this second decade twentieth century, Your Excellency has she accuse a man of ritual murder? I'm not fooled enough to believe these stories. Believe me. Do not harm the Jews neither in Russia nor in person. Everything comes from human nature. Is it in human nature to accuse an innocent person? It's possible. Man, by nature, is unhappy. And it is the passion, not reason, which the guide. Please ... We govern men in governing their passion. It unites men unifying their passion. Hatred predominates love. It is their hatred between them. Our reflex is to eliminate the reason for their hatred. If farmers hate tsar - As I fear - he is little time left to live. It is best they kill a Jew. It is in everyone's interest. A confession solve everything. For our salvation ... and the Jews. I'm lost. Finished. We still have a chance. Listen to me. I will not charge you. The boy spoke his classmates illegal trafficking which perpetuated his mother. He was killed by her mother's lover to avoid talking about it. And it certainly helped. I have a witness, who saw the dead boy in the bathtub of his mother. Long before we found the in the cave. The blows were inflicted thereafter ... when he was already dead. To incriminate the Jews. They destroyed the life of a man. And a little boy. Excuse me ... The attorney knows it what you have to say? Grubeshov was ordered to destroy any evidence that will exonerate. They want to condemn you. I want to prove them wrong. I ask you to stay confident ... and patient. I trust you. I am patient and kind. However ... I do not mean to sound bitter, but I do not eat in the hand. Your bitterness not offend me in any way. I'm afraid to disappoint you. How could you? Who knows? I must leave you. I think ... men sometimes fail. When trying to accomplish what they hold dear. So if you happen to fail ... involuntarily of course ... and at that time, I'm taken a terrible fear ... after all, who could call it a failure? Yes, who could? Indeed. This is not madness which messes up the world. It is the consciousness. The tub! Put your shoes. - My feet ... - I do not know. Put your shoes. It's a trap. They attract you to shoot you. There is nobody. Person. Is it possible? Should I try my luck or regret it later? Up! The old Jew that you received telling us about you. The only way to save your skin is to confess the vile plot. Soup! I'm not going the day here. We need scrap of your nails. - Arise. - I can not. Look at my feet. Take him to the infirmary. We cut his nails there. Advance! I can not walk. Then ramp. It will give you a lesson, Bok. Now you know what little has suffered. Admit it, if you want morphine. You're lucky. The director sends you gifts. He believes that practicing Judaism will do you good. A Bible? A Christian Bible. "The centurion, that was in front of Jesus, "Seeing that he had expired so, said: "Certainly, this man was the Son of God. " A poor carpenter. That must have tinkering here and there. The last Jew in the kingdom of David and the first Christians. Meanwhile Christian he hated his Jewish side? How is this possible? His whole being was Jewish. And Christian at the same time. He did not know hatred. Baragouines that you? I just realized ... Those who hate the Jews or any other human being ... hate Jesus. You can not be anti-Semitic ... without rejecting Christianity. It is in the Gospel. Then? Nothing. It only reads. No incantation or prayer? No Shawl or yarmulke? Almighty God, forgives sins this young Hebrew. Help him to forgive us our sins to him. We forgive you? I do not forgive anyone. I beg you to listen. God appeared to me. Your troubles will cease if you accept God. You must confess your crimes and repent. I beseech you, Yakov Shepsovitch. You heard me, Lord. You heard my voice. Let your name be sanctified. Open the door. Guard, open the door. What's going on? I received a message of Heaven. Tomorrow six hours after the rooster, the Jew will recognize the divinity of Jesus Christ and confess everything. Satan! Mary, protect me. I focused on the Evil Eye. Hold it. Returns it. My God! My God! What was he? I am a man. I am a man. Raisl! I love you, Raisl! Why did you leave me? I'm lost in the depths of the universe. I pray. Where are you? I'm going crazy. Help me, I'm sinking. God has destroyed I have no friends, help me. I'll drown in tears and slime of this world. Mom, Dad, save me. Raisl, anyone. Help me. The world has forgotten me. I walk to Jerusalem to the mountains of the moon. I walk to hell. I walk to St. Petersburg see the Tsar. His Imperial Majesty Nicolas II. Emperor, Tsar and Autocrat of all the Russias. Yakov Bok, handyman. Please undress. Excuse me? Undress! Keep your shirt. Remove the rest. Why? I have to search you. What are you looking for? Pity. Stop shoving me. Who's there? The king of Bulgaria! I leave you. You have two minutes, no more. Doing yourself. Look at me. What have I missed your face? Nothing. What did they cut? What did you cut? We were poor and childless, but you're also a prostitute. A man, it does not me a prostitute. A wife either. You stopped loving me because I could not give you a child. I'm not here for that. Forget it, it's over. Why so? I returned to the shtetl and dad told me. I implored the General Counsel let me see you. He told me to bring you a paper. Sign and you are free. I curse this paper! I curse you for bringing him here. Stop yelling and sign. That's why you came. To betray me again. It was the only way to see you. This is not the real reason I'm here. I came crying. You cried already the last time I saw you. Two years later, I'll see you crying. God, why are you crying? I do not know. Tears are tears. Do not cry anymore. Forgive me not honored to have you in bed. I had to punish someone and you gave me a scapegoat. You were the person nearest. What can I say? If everything were to start again, I'd cry less. Then stop. There is not that much. I have news for you which may sadden you. I gave birth to a child. It was time. Boy or girl? Boy. How to call it? Chaiml, like my grandfather. It's a pretty name. He is doing well? Obviously. Besides my asthma, I never got sick. Yakov, you do not understand. I left you there are more than two years. Stop it! The baby is less than a year. If you can have children, where was the problem? Why do we ever had? Who knows? They sometimes come on later. It is a matter of luck. Lucky me has always been lacking. I already find incredible to be alive. What do you want from me? This would make things easier if you recognize a child. You do not have to. The father ... The father is a goy. He was a Jew, a musician. He did that happen. It is the parent, not the father. Whoever behaves father is the real father. My own father cares. Make the sign and go. Give. This written confession is a tissue of lies. I declare that the legitimate father of Chaiml, the son born to Bok Raisl by my wife. Come to the aid of my wife and my child in spite of all my troubles. I'd appreciate it. Out. English Petition includes 240 names, whose archbishops Canterbury and York, Cardinal Bourne and Primate of Ireland.

Better than that, my friend. Tsar party the tercentenary of his dynasty by pardoning several criminals, including you. You can go in your village. Shtetl. It's called a shtetl. You are free you have been pardoned. I have committed no crime. I do not want amnesty I ask for a trial. If you try release me without trial, he will shoot me. You treated me as a criminal. Prove it. Yakov Bok, I implore you, on behalf of the tsar. Prevent the worst tragedy that can befall the Jewish people. I prevent it. During my trial. You're crazy. No, Mr. Prosecutor. This is not madness. He would understand. Who? Mr. Bibikov. This is not madness. But consciousness. Of consciousness. This is horrible of killing such a man. It would be wise not to blame that you depend on. Wisdom has never been my forte. I felt a change perpetuate itself in me, Mr. Minister. Fear gave way to hatred. Who do you hate? Tsar. Government. You.
