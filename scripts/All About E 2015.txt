Where is she? 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. It's E time! E! Where's E? I think she's gone. E, E, E...! It's E time! Here's the money for E. Thanks. You must really work out. Not that much. I could make an exception to my no-men's-clothing rule, and design a perfect t-shirt to show off those arms. Thanks. Johnny will see you in his office after E's set. Right. Stunning as always, eh, hen? Ok, it's a new theme - Arabian nights. It's gonna be a smash. Matt's drawings are brilliant. Here is me as the sheikh. Och, not this towel-head thing again. Stick to the Spanish theme. The punters love it. Let's leave the arabs out of it, eh? Och, come on, now, hen. Have we not got a winner here with the Spanish thing? Yeah, but it's not really me, Johnny. Dinnae mess with it till I say so, eh? Now... Was there anything you wanted to tell me, anything you think ah should know? You mean, the gig at ice? Well, aren't we the popular one, then? I suppose it's too much to ask for a wee bit of loyalty. Oh, come on! Don't be like that, Johnny. You know you'll always be number one. Aye, I know I will. And that is why I took the Liberty of telling those lads at ice that you were nae available. - You can't do that! - Who took a risk on a wee, Leb Naebody from the gong, turned her into the top dj? Now, I'm thinking, we need a coffee and a catch-up... Just you and me, like old times. - Sure, but I don't... - And in future, you ask your uncle Johnny before you go taking gigs from other people. Is that too much to ask? Of course not, Johnny. Now you give your uncle Johnny a kiss, and then you two can piss off, eh? Ol! Want one? Why not? Mornin', cupcake! Oh! And where is last night's new best friend, hm? You know the policy, no overnights. Now go away. Don Juana, charming as always. She's better off out of your web anyway. Now, how do you stand this pigsty? Hm? hm? Piss off! Leave me alone. I am dyyy-ing dyyy-ing, dyyy-ing! Go away! Ow! And here's me, looking forward to this all morning. To what? You don't know what I'm talking about, do you? Of course I do. You take the fecking cake, E. You really do. Oh, come on, don't be like my mother. At least my mother would have remembered my fecking birthday. I'll take you to bill's for breakfast. Now get your shameless arse in that shower. Hey. Hey. Starry, starry night. Yeah, sure is. You play very well. Just not well enough to pass my exams. Was that your own tune you played? Well, it's not Mozart's. That's a gift. Thanks. E! Shower! In a taxi? Please tell me I'm dreaming. You left ma' money in a fucking taxi? You fuckin... Fucked up... Fuck! A dress designer. He wants to know what I look like. Alright, let's see. Hello there, John boy. Someone once said I'm like an Irish version of Robert Pattinson. You? Liar, liar, pants on fire. I'm a bit old-fashioned. Can we chat a bit more before we meet? - Elmira? - Mrs Malouf. It's me, Matt. Matthew. Elmira? No, she's in the shower. Manners! Manners, manners! Babe, who was that? - Your mother. - What does she want? What does she want every Saturday when she calls? That I don't exist. You back on the chat room again? No! How else am I supposed to find a man? Not by pretending you have amazing abs, that's for sure. Outrageous! Speaking of outrageous, what are we going to do about Johnny? Look, I know he gets a little bit over the top. Over the top? Psychopathic, more like. We have to leave, E. Ice really want us. They'll let us do Arabian nights. Whatever we want. Jaki heard that Johnny threatened to firebomb them - if we play there. - Fuck, E! What is it with you and him? Stop. Make it bigger. Who's that blonde tart? It's the barmaid from ice. Icethose fucking towelheads. Shite! That's E. It is too. Boss, you can't think E's involved? There's no way she'd do that to me. Oh. Looks like Johnny's ears are burning. Jesus, E! It's my fecking birthday. D'you think we can just last one day without talking to that psycho scrooge uncle of yours? Ok, I'm all yours. It's off. Let's go. I need a coffee. Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Hey, this is E. You know what... In your pigsty, please. Not mine. Well, it's not mine. Well, it's not mine. Well, it's not mine! We are so in the money! Where did it come from? Who cares? Well, how much is here? Listen, E, what happened last night? Nothing. Jaki and I were wasted, so we caught a taxi. Which taxi? We have to give it back. Are you crazy? - I'm calling the police. - No you're not. Give it! Matt! Who is it? We're collecting for the give a girl a go appeal. Kylie and Tanya. We're collecting for the give a girl a go appeal. Ah, here you go, girls. - Love your work. - Thank you. Tightarse. Here! You girls are doing a great job. Think! In a bag like this, this much cash. Do you think that a) The taxi driver who gave you a lift is just some eccentric millionaire who's driving his taxi for kicks? No. I didn't think so either. Or what do you think, is it actually by some son-of-a-gun drug dealer who's a little too smashed on his own merchandise to realise he's mislaid a small matter of, what, say, half a million in used 50s? So why don't we keep it? No! Because that taxi driver is probably navigating under water as we speak, and I tell you, I cannot swim! Calm the fuck down. No-one knows that we have this. They find the taxi driver, they find us. I want it out of the house now. Bad Karma! Come on, Matt. You want to leave Johnny, right? Oh, my god! Of course! Fuck. He didn't leave anything! You've got the wrong man! I didn't find anything! No, wait, no! Boss? Why do you have to bullshit everyone? - I didn't. - Oh, for sure. The flowers were for me! Yoo-hoo! Mr and Mrs Toreador. Hi, girls. Hi, Mitze, kitty. Matt and his machine. You can always tell a man by what he rides. Hey, arse fuckers! Old, fucking fags! - What the fuck is that? - Waste of a good Holden. Piss off and leave us alone. Suck my dick, ya fuckin' dyke. My pleasure, darling... Wa-hey! If I could find the tiny thing, I so would. What did he say to me? Psycho bitch! Fuck off! You ok, girls? Aren't you a little ninja turtle? Just young boys, letting off a bit of steam, Darl. I'm sure I fucked one of those boys last month. I need a drink. Come on. Bye, Matt. Bye, E. Fuck! Oh, my god. What the fuck? Do you know how much these cost now? Oh, he must have every model! Come on! - You didn't lock the door. - Me? you were last to leave. Shit! Shit. You said nobody knew. We have to go to the police. Stop screaming. I'm trying to think. I'm sure that car is following us. Ohh. A mother and two kidsyeah. We just need to find someone who'll put us up for a couple of days while we work out what to do, ok? What about Leonora, my old landlady? We are not that desperate. Oh! Who is this girl? She was a beachside romance. She really loves me. Well! That went well. Mum! Dad! She said she was a bit confused. Not anymore. Hey, Lou. It's been over a year. Wait - I've got your money. Plus 100 to say thanks. Took you long enough. What happened, you rob a bank? Look, the thing is, Lou, we need a place to stay, just for a few days. - I don't think that's a g... - Habibti. You know I wouldn't ask unless it was urgent. Nah, nah. My mum was right about you. You're trouble, E. If we're finished with those people you've dumped, ignored or fought with, we might have no other alternative. You said she was a total fruit loop. Well, that doesn't mean she can't be trusted. I had a feeling you'd be coming. Many happy returns. Don't ask. Leonora. Leonora Laventallini. E. Just E. Well, that's short and to the point. Come in. This is you, the page of cups - beautiful, artistic, emotional... Deep. But reversed, this is the immature card. I could have told you that. More swords behind you. Great loss or heartbreak. - Her younger brother. - Matt, don't. Michael. He was only 17. Killed - drunk driver. - Terrible! - Matt, shut up! This doesn't feel like a man. - This feels like a woman. - Ok. We don't have time for this psychic babble. E! How can you be so rude? Can we borrow your car? Shite, shite! What are we going to do, E? Why don't we ask Johnny? He knows all the heavies. Stop running to feckin Johnny all the time. I'm just saying he'd know what to do. What a grand idea... let's go live with uncle Johnny. You got any better ideas? What about Bali, or Shanghai? My one and only chance to travel first-class... How was I supposed to know you need ID for domestic travel? You went to college! I rely on you. Well, you shouldn't! I dropped out. Hey, this is E. - Elmira? - Hi, mumma. It's me. Matt and I were thinking of visiting you and dad. We... we could come now, really. Clarinet concerto in a minor penny for them? It'll cost you. Oh, really how much? You can't afford it. Says who, Princess? - Princess?! - Yeah! - Says me, skippy! - We'll see about that! Move in with me. What? Move in with me. Really? Really. Ok. Jaysus! Can we not play something else? Your man Kenny g sounds like he's being strangled. Ow! What was that for? Kenny g plays the sax, not the clarinet. Sax, clarinet - what's the diff? Equal love, equal life whether you're man and husband or woman and wife equal love, equal life we're spelling it out - lgbt better than Mozart better than Mozart better than Mozart... Wollongong! Equal love equal life, equal life we're spelling it out - lgbti equal love equal love equal life equal li... who keeps ringing? No-one. 'No-one!' you find them? I dinnae believe this. The biggest deal of my life. And that's the good life. Every time we passed the stacks, dad would say, 'see this? this biggest in Southern hemisphere. I work here for you. This what get you good school, good house, good life.' I've tried so hard to get away... And I'm here again. - Shit! - Ignore it. I can't. - Ok, ok. I'll answer it. - No! - No! - Hello? - Elmira? - Hello, mrs Malouf. - Elmira? - No, this is Trish. - Hello, mumma. - Who? - No, it's me. - You still in bed? No, mumma. I've been up for hours. Who answered your phone. You have visitor? No, that's Trish. You know, my flatmate. I have some very important news. Your cousin Darina, she christen the baby Michael on the 30th. I didn't think she talked to you. This time we invited. We come to Sydney for three days. The church, a big party afterwards - everybody coming. The 30th for three days. Who you talking to? You no want us to come? I'm not staying with Darina. No, mumma, of course you can stay. Trish will be away that weekend, won't you, Trish? Mumma, I'm going to have to call you back. - Hey. - Don't. What could I do? I don't know. You could say no. You could say, 'let me just ask Trish. She really hates it when I take all of her stuff out of our room and puts it in the lounge like she's the bloody lodger. - It's not like that. - You could even say, 'my beautiful lover and I have our anniversary that weekend, and it's really important.' I'm really sorry. You know how crazy she makes me. Yeah, I do, but I thought just this once you could think of me, of us. - I do! - So tell them. You're ashamed, aren't you? You're a coward, E. You're a fucking coward. Is my tattoo covered? Uh-huh. Do I look straight? Now? Now? Now? Alright, wifey, let's go face the music. You never come to see us. You ring us three hours ago. Where you beenyour father and I been worried sick. Mumma, relax. We're here now. Mrs Malouf... The food is almost ruined. Come, we eat now. Red hair! How can you do this to us? Habibti, we miss you. Me too, dad. You, you come with me. Mr Malouf. Joseph. Sorry - Joseph. How's it going, mate? Good, thanks. You come, no warning. We have no food in the house. Why we have to have this emergency meeting, like you have emergency wedding, huh? I still can't believe you thought I was pregnant. Don't eat! Cut some onion. We need more onion. Oh, that's... - I... I take this. - Oh no! No, it's alright. Sit, sit. Why you marry this fat man with red hair? Mum! He's not fat, and he's not deaf. And why you wear your hair like this? And why you choose him when you could have that boy, Khabbaz? 'Cause he's a pig, that's why. Cut the bread, we need more bread. What about your music? You fail your exam. Everybody know. They say, 'why she leave university?' your brother never do this to us! Yeah. He just stole cars and didn't finish high school but he's still Saint Michael. You shame us. We already live with so much shame. Elmira. You proper musician. You can work in the orchestra, teach music, get proper job. Your teacher say so. I tried, and it's not me, mumma. No? Who you, Elmira? Who you are? All my life I work hard for you to go to university, but you! It gets too hard, you just throw it all away. Poof! Like that! Like it's nothing, like we nothing. How can you say that? Ever since you a little girl, you like this, stubborn! No respect. Your father and I, we give you everything. We have you, we get married. I don't sing anymore. I never asked you to have me. Umi... You and me, we're not too different, you know. You reckon? You make my stomach very bad from what you do to us. - Dr Nassar... - What does he say? He say my ulcer is back. Is very bad. I go back to hospital if I not careful, if I get upset. Alright umi. You can have a huge party for us. Invite every single cousin we have. You play clarinet for us? I haven't played in over a year. Ok. Just tonight, give Matt a chance. A fat chance, huh Whew! What's this called again? - Arak. - Ah, is the milk of the lion. It's very special. It's from my brother in Lebanon. - It's lethal. - It suits this kitty cat. I'm just saying, what we do in Ireland in the country is sing and dance. Lord of the riverdance, that's me. I love to dance. I used to dance all the time in the club in Beirut. I bet you cut a fine figure on the dance floor, mrs Malouf. I better singer, ah, a long time ago. You show us this dancing. Er... I don't think that's such a great idea. How about a song for us, mrs Malouf? Please, you leave this man alone. Your father, he doesn't like singing or dancing. But you listen to me - he used to like it before everything change. Nadine! No, you cooked. Let me clean up. No, I do. You guest. No, I insist. - We do together. - Together! Together, together. - Oh, Danny boy... - Oh, you sing! Your mother never sing anymore. You upset her. Since the day I was born. Oh, my god. Please tell me your mother gave you those. Fabulous. What? Even though we're married? They don't like you that much. Do you not miss it? Nah. Being a dj's much cooler. Especially when dressed by moi! Clarinet concerto in a minor aye, that sounds like an ok deal, but what are your delivery times? I need this lot fast. Ok. We'll get to the bit where I cut your toes off fairly soon now, so you'll maybe be wanting to try and remember where that bitch has taken ma money, eh? I swear, I don't know! Check the wee bitch's phone. Elmira it's for you - a man. Why you get call here this time? Sh, mum! Hello who's this? You treacherous, wee wog. So this is how you repay me? - Why he ring this late? - Dad, please take mum... - You take mah money... - Your money? - What you done? - Mumma! Dinnae play the innocent with me! Why've you no answered your mobile, eh? You get my cash here by nine, or I dinnae know what I'll do. Matt! Get up. It's Johnny, it's Johnny's money. He knows where we are. - We need to leave now. - What? oh, my god! Oh, sweet Jesus! But why we have to leave now? I no like Ali. He is a bad man. He's got bad friends, he smoke bad cigarettes. - Exactly. - He can't cook! - We stay here. - Mumma, you can't stay here. Dad, please tell her. You have to go to Ali. - Tell him there's trouble. - Enough! We will go. Dad, I'm so sorry. Is for you, for later. Let's go. I knew this was too good to be true. We have to give it back, E. - No, we don't. - What? He thinks he's in charge of everything, can control everyone. Well, he's about to find out he's wrong. Are you crazy? He had no right to cancel ice. Let him stew. It's not like he can go to the police and report it missing. No, but he can kill us. Not if he can't find us. Do you think your parents will be ok? Yeah. Ali's a thug. If anyone can handle Johnny, he can. I wish we'd given it to the police. Then Johnny really would kill us. I still don't get you and him. Ok, so you don't get it. Nobody does. Hey. You know, I still don't know why all of row 4 have died. It should be a good mix. - I got it, Trish. - Got what? Johnny's given me top billing. You're looking at the new resident dj for Saturday nights. Don't you have clarinet quartet on Saturday nights? No biggie. They can find someone else. I thought you said they'd fail you if you didn't play in the quartet? Maybe I don't want to play the clarinet anymore. You're joking? This is my chance. Johnny says that I'm the best dj he's seen in years. I could be really big. Why can't you be happy for me? I can, if it's what you really want. - It is. - I don't believe you. Well, it's the truth. I don't want to play the clarinet anymore. Jaysus, E! Pull in! You're not fit to drive. And I could eat a small child. I need a hangover cure! Well, what d'ya think? Don't ask me, then. Furthest I've ever been is Bondi beach. Hm... And one time when I went to Brisbane. Met a guy online. I arrived for a romantic weekend. One word - disaster. Let's just say, I know why the caged bear sings, and it's not my tune. What about taking Arabian nights to Melbourne? Mm. Ow! No wonder you can't keep the weight off. - Sorry? - You heard. You have no idea what it's like to be me. Come on Matt, I didn't mean it like that. Uh-huh. Yes, you did. Here I am, a fat, Irish redhead looking for true love in the Sydney meat market, full of tanned gym junkies who are all as superficial as you. What's my chances, hey E? Come on! You know you're my best friend. When it suits you. You're a selfish little shite. No wonder your woman Trish left you. what are you doing here? Three days, E. Must have been really special. Trish, wait! Please. Oh, fuck. Gay chat - again? At least they talk to me on gay chat. Look. Hello is that the believer? Oh, yes, it's E here. I need some help being a real person. Hope is drying out in the state's north-west as the long drought shows no sign of breaking. play. Clarinet concerto in a major it's boring. Can we not play something good? This is much better than good. It's a feckin' downer, that's what it is. It's god. That's what it is. Oh, my god! Pull in, pull in! What? Hello, Johnny. I'm just checking on you and mah money, hen. You near? We're at Rockdale. Um, lots of traffic. Shouldn't be too long. Better not be. Oh, fuck. Fuck. What have I done? Please god, my parents stay at Ali's. Hey, this is E... Well, just say it! What? I'm not stupid. I don't know what you're talking about. Ok, so you don't. Ok, Trish. Trish lives out here. You happy? I am now. Don't you think we'd better let her know that you're coming? She hasn't spoken to me in a year. After what you did, do you blame her? This is it. Go. Tiny, in. Trish? Hello? Trish, can I come in? Trish? Trish? - Hey. - What gives you the right? Nothing. Trish, I'm in trouble - serious trouble. - So you bring it here? - Please, Trish. You've driven a long way for nothing. Tiny! Let's go. Tiny! Tiny, get back here! Look, sorry to land unannounced. I wouldn't be asking, but we've no place left to go. If you say no, we're stuffed. If you love E half as much as she loves you, you'll help. You're our last chance. Do I have to do everythin' myself? And so you see, we had no idea, and now Johnny's ready to cut our throats. We just need time to sort out... You can stay the night, two at the most. After that, I want you and your damn money gone. What am I gonna do on Saturday night? Mikey! No, no. There's no problem. I have it, but there's a wee technical hitch. I need a wee bit more time. Ach, come on. There's no need to involve the abbas lads. You and me, we've got a deal, right? Ok. When? Ok. I will, I'll have it. No problem. Aye. This is not fuckin' happening! So where's your mum? Oh, you don't know. After dad died, she just kind of gave up. She's gone to live with her sister in Sydney. You can't stay? Nah. It's mortgaged to the hilt. Let me give you the money. I don't think so, E. Why why won't you let me help you? Help, you? You can't even help yourself. Well? The neighbour said they'd gone to their cousin's or something, but E and Matt didn't go with them. - Outside. - Mr a! What's happening? I heard something's missing. Who told you that? Did Mikey call you? - So nothing is missing, then? - No. Mr A, I tell you, there's no problem. Good. can't believe you kept it. What are you doing in here? Trish, I couldn't sleep. You? What am I doing? You really hurt me, E, and I promised myself I would never let you do that again. - Me too. - Yet here you are, back in my life, causing trouble, as always. - Please, Trish. - Just don't. I can't. Hello, you. Hello, you. You know, I did try, Trish. I really did... Try? You don't know the meaning of the word. Try running a property after ten years of drought. Try beating cancer. That's not fair. Are you serious? Oh, right on cue. I was wondering where you girls were. - I have made... - I won't be having breakfast. Be out all day. Come on, tiny. Be careful - you'll flood it. Be my guest. After all I've done for that wee bitch. What am ah to do, eh, hen? What? Why's she done this to me, eh? Got ya. Fuckin' gotcha! I don't know how I'm going to live without that sound. E was right, you are an angel. And yet, despite my best efforts, here I am, single. Their loss. E's really lucky to have you as a friend. It's a buffet. Something I meant to give you a long time ago. I gotta go. Morning, Prue. I've just been talking about you. - All good, I hope. - Not really, but you'll live. Seriously - a couple of blokes from Sydney been asking about you. That's me - miss popularity. What did they want? How to get to your place. They seemed very keen to see it. What were they like? One was Scottish, or Irish. Bloody rude, if you ask me. - Yeah? - I didn't like them. I sent them via stony gums. - That's for 4-wheel drives. - Yeah, I know. Thanks, Prue. - Hey, that was quick! - Where's E? She's still on the fence line. Hey, what's the hurry? You need to get up to the warrens' old property. No-one will find you up there. That food'll keep you for a bit. As long as I don't have to fire that thing. Hopefully, it won't come to that. Now, clothes. You want me to walk 20 more kilometres? We're not going without you. - I have to talk to Bev first. - Who's Bev? That's none of your business. Now get going, and take tiny with you. Come on, tiny. Fucking push! You get this fucking car going, and come and pick me up. Understood? Oh, god. You've slept with her, haven't you? What makes you say that? Trish, I haven't slept with anyone in five years. It gives you a kind of NASA like radar. I can literally smell the pheromones coming off you. I hope you know what you're doing, hon. That's just it - I don't. She comes here after all this time, and I can't help it. It's like, I'm screaming, 'no, don't go near her, ' but my body just won't obey me. - Oh-oh. That sounds bad. - It is. Like, bad-bad or bad-good? Look, I just need you to help me get rid of her before she gets herself killed. - Can you do that for me? - Sure. You know I love an adventure. How many flies did you eat, E? Tell you what - that's why I'm fat, all these flies you've got in this country. Feck! Flies! Don't worry, I can handle Johnny. Johnny won't hurt us. Johnny loves me! Come on, Matt. Always think you can get out of things, don't you, E? - How was I to know? - I dunno. Be radical. Try thinking of other people instead of yourself, for once! Your woman Trish had the right idea - keep well away. - Matt, I'm sorry. - Not as sorry as I am. If we get out of this alive, we're getting a divorce. I'm taking my share, and I'm back to Ireland. You can keep your flies too. Come on, tiny. Huh, the Hilton! - It's not bad. - And I'm filthy! I'll get tea on. Baked beans, coming up, no doubt. You're more than welcome to cook yourself. No, look - sorry. Truce. I'm sorry about that stuff I said before. I'm just... I'm tired and I'm scared, and... Me too. What do you mean, no way? Seems to me like you're in with a chance, if you don't blow it. She should be here by now. And that is how I met the parents. I can't believe you're still going through with this charade. Well, you would too, if you knew my parents. Well, I was never allowed to, was I? We should all get some rest. Bev will be here at first light. She'll take you as far as Katherine. That is so fabulous of her. Ow! beautiful. Scary, but beautiful. You still play like an angel. I wish. Trish. Don't. I promised myself that I would never let you do that again. Come with me. I can't. I need you to go back to your own bed now. I can't think straight with you near me. - Good morning! - Johnny! Trish, are you alright? So this is how you and that wee wog repay me, eh, fat man? - Johnny, what are you doing? - Shut up! Where is she? This is nothing to do with Trish. Let her go. No? I'd say it has everything to do with her. Now, you have ten seconds before I start cutting, and as you know, I am rather fond of cutting. Alright, alright. I'll get the money. Just don't hurt her. - Let her go, Johnny. - Fuck you, ginger! You throw the sack over here first, eh? How do I know you won't hurt her? Well, I guess that's the fun bit. You don't. Drop the knife, Johnny. Oh, how touching. The dj saves her girlfriend! I dinnae think so. I bet you don't even know how to use that thing. Why'd you do it to me? Why would you want to leave me? I can't do it anymore, Johnny. Look, hen, we go way back. You give me my money back and we can sort something out. You can do your towel-head thing if you want. Let her go. You're hurting her. Mah money first, or your sheep-shagger lady friend gets it. 10, 9, 8, 7... Don't make me do it, Johnny. I don't want to, but hurt her, and I promise you, I will blow your brains out. Tie him up. Go. Come on, come on. Quickly! Get him in! We're running out of runway, folks. Tiny! Look out! Go, tiny, go. E! That was stupid, hen. Why'd you do it, E? - You don't want to hurt me. - I made you. You're nothing without me. I can't be that E anymore. You have to find someone else. Someone else...? Ok, let's go. Let's go! What are you doing? I don't want the money. I just want you. That's all I've ever wanted. Oh, no! No! Many are the roads that do not lead to the heart so take courage in both your hands be true to your heart my darling, my heart remember who you are hear the song calling you follow your heart it's the crack of dawn and I am traveling along a dusty road the moon is fading into white opening these watercoloured skies and my belly button burns 'cause I know I've so much left to learn these are the days given with grace these are the old and new these are the days given with grace but never to hold onto it's the crack of dawn and I'm traveling the passages of time open up your heart, they say for with every wound there's wisdom to be gained so I open the door and I open some more then even when I've fallen fallen down I'll rise these are the days given with grace these are the old and new these are the days given with grace but never to hold onto so open the door and let it open some more then even when I've fallen fallen down I'll rise these are the days given with grace these are the old and new these are the days given with grace but never to hold onto it's the crack of dawn and I am traveling along a dusty road.
