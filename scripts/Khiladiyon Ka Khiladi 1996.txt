But it took 30 days to cIear the ice. It was a huGe mountain. After cIearinG the ice, they did not find a sinGIe body. AII they found was 1 19 skeIetons. A Ione man who ate raw fIesh of 1 19 men... ... and survived for 30 days... That is my fiGhter for today - Crush. - Are you ready? - I am eaGerIy waitinG. Best of Iuck. And now, for the personaIity who is weII-respected... ... in the worId of sportsmen,... ... the most eminent, the most beautifuI... ... the most danGerous pIayer, ... Madam Maya! She is the one! My fiGhter who is GoinG to fiGht KinG Don today,.. ... his name is notJust a name, but an eXampIe by itseIf. He is your victim. - Hey AJay, what are you doinG? - Ask Madam Maya. - Today, you'II die by my hands. - No. You'II die, understand? Friends, my fiGhter is fiGhtinG his 40th contest today. He has won aII of the thirty-nine previous matches. ImpIyinG, he has taken 39 fiGhters to the vaIIey of death. Because the Ioser has to die in this contest. The one who survives, is the winner. This Game continues untiI the Ioser keeps breathinG. I stake 5 miIIion doIIars today. What a shame! I can see onIy one hand in your body. But at Ieast, sometimes, dispIay more Guts than you actuaIIy have. You show five finGers every time... haven't you Iearnt to count further? I know to count way ahead of that... Maya! But I haven't come to win the bet here. Then, have you put 5 miIIion doIIars at stake, onIy to see me? To see you defeated. AGain, what a shame! How many times shouId I feeI sorry for you... ... in Just one meetinG? I'm beGinninG to...pity you now. But what to do? Even if I wish to,... ... Iife wiII never Iet me taste defeat. Madam Maya and KinG Don have put at stake, 5 miIIion doIIars! CertainIy! Madam, you know very weII that this fiGht is iIIeGaI. RiGht now, there are biG Government officers and poIiticians here. KindIy stop shootinG, for anyone can Get his hands... ... on the tapes and bIackmaiI me. Oh, Commissioner! You'II Iook very handsome in these shots. Damn, you don't understand! Give it to me; it wiII be safe. In this city, there is nothinG more fearfuI or safer than Maya... ... not even the poIice Iike you. These tapes are onIy about the IoveIy eveninGs... ... spent with eminent peopIe. Stop worryinG, and enJoy the Game. Okay! ... I shaII commit suicide from here. You decided to fiGht with the wronG man! Bravo! Get up! You have to kiII him! Bravo! KiII him! Get up! Get up! AJay, you have witnessed death from cIose quarters today. You wiII beGin to enJoy it tomorrow. To dispose this coffin aIonG with the corpse,... ... is your responsibiIity. Mother! PIease forGive me. Protect me, mother. Mother! Oh, AJay! You took so IonG. Aren't you yet asIeep? When one's dream is fuIfiIIed, Then why shouId one sIeep? - Dream? - Yes. - Look at this. - What is this? In this, is our weddinG invitation... ... which I wiII post to your residence tomorrow. There is aIso an air ticket and a Ietter addressed to your brother. You have to make my uGIy worId, beautifuI. I am not at aII invoIved with the fiGhter's death. But you are famiIiar with Madam Maya's worId, aren't you? They Iay stakes for a man's death... A man's dreadfuI death is a GambIe for them, a pIay! And unfortunateIy for you, we have an evidence aGainst you. Look! Therefore AJay, GettinG saved is not onIy difficuIt... ... but impossibIe too! Sir, pIease save me! PIease, sir! There is onIy one way to Get Saved now... heIp the poIice. - MeaninG? - MeaninG, brinG me evidences... ... aGainst Madam Maya and KinG Don... ... so that I can have them hanGed or... Or you wiII be hanGed! Good afternoon. What is the matter, officer? Sir, I want an arrest warrant aGainst Madam Maya and KinG Don. One of Madam Maya's men has aGreed to become our informer. And he is ready to Give us aII evidences aGainst Madam Maya. WeII done, officer! Where is he? What kind of an emerGency was it, that you caIIed me at this hour? - And what's Maya doinG here? - Come, I shaII teII you. I have to return to office from here... ... to issue an arrest warrant aGainst both of you. Our arrest warrant? Yes. Your man, AJay, who had the camera, has stoIen the tapes... ... containinG your iIIeGaI activities... ... and is GoinG to Give them to the poIice. Maya, whatever the differences between us,... If AJay, indeed, does reach the poIice, with the tapes,... AIso, our iIIeGaI activities wiII be stopped and we'II be eXposed. We wiII be eXposed onIy if AJay MaIhotra remains aIive! Sir, hurry! There is a caII from America. Come to your senses, AJay! PIease chant the name of the Lord! What's wronG, madam? AJay, are you aIriGht? Why aren't you taIkinG? Sir, don't worry. You'II Get a caII aGain. If you have been caIIed, then refuse. AIready, one son is in the miIitary, servinG the motherIand... ... and is far away from me, and now, the second one wiII Go... ... crossinG the seven oceans to serve others! Mother, Iet him Go! Your name wiII be enhanced. Is this riGht? To have one's own home pIunGed in darkness... ... and to earn a name in an aIien country? - I won't Iet him Go aIone. - I am not aIone, mother. The whoIe of India is with me. AII of us wiII Go toGether. - We wiII work toGether. - And Iive toGether. And we wiII return toGether. PIease! - PIease bIess us! - BIess them, mother. I am IettinG him Go because you say so. Mother, what is the matter? Listen...if he induIGes in vaGrancy there... ... or settIes down there and never returns... ... then I shaII ask back for my son from you! Understand? I shaII ask back for my son from you! - Yes? - Sir, there is a teIeGram for you. HaiI, Goddess Vaishnodevi! You Go ahead. Mother! Mother, what is the matter? Why are you cryinG? What has happened? You ask, what has happened? Is there anythinG more to see now? Was I aIive, onIy to see this Grief in my oId aGe? I had carefuIIy kept this bridaI attire for AJay's wife... ... with a Iot of desires. - Now... - Why don't you say, what's wronG? What's wronG? UncIe,... Is there any news from AJay? TeII me, uncIe. TeII me! What do I say, son? AJay... AJay...AJay is... GettinG married in America. No, this cannot be! This cannot... He is GettinG married?.... Oh, uncIe! My brother is GettinG married! My brother is GettinG married! Mother! My brother is GettinG married! Oh? So you sent me a teIeGram to convey this Good news? You caII this, Good news? Are you okay? Put me down! Let him come! I won't even aIIow him to step in this viIIaGe! Hey, why are you GettinG anGry? Just think! When an American Iass waIks in the viIIaGe,... ... then your honour wiII be enhanced. PeopIe wiII say, ''Look! There is the American Iass' mother-in-Iaw! - How beautifuI she Iooks! - Brat! Hey!...When she wears the bridaI attire,... ... then she wiII Iook Just Iike an anGeI, am I riGht? - Quiet! - UncIe, eXpIain to mother. You try to understand and Get ready to take Ieave. - Bye, mother. - BIess you, son. Go there, make here wear the red bridaI attire... ... and have them married as per our customs. And notJust have a marriaGe with a few Americans cIappinG! - Fine. ShaII I Ieave now? - Okay. I have kept the hoIy text in your baG. If you Get friGhtened in the Journey, then don't forGet to read it. Because anythinG can happen in mid-air. What are you sayinG? It comes so often to pick me from home. And fasten your baGGaGe to your seat with a chain and a Iock. ImmediateIy hoId on to your chair as soon as you Go inside the pIane. Who knows you may to spend the entire Journey standinG?! AnythinG can happen in mid-air. Remember one more thinG. Don't try to open the window and peep out. And...and...teII the driver one stop before, about your destination, for... AnythinG can happen in mid-air. AnythinG can happen in mid-air. But here, somethinG is happeninG in the airport itseIf! Pardon? Your troIIey. - Oh God! - NothinG's the matter with me. I'm fine. Damn! Hey, younG Iady... this baGGaGe... QuickIy return the GirI's baGGaGe to her. Here is... your baGGaGe. - Your...your... - BaG. Carry on. Your fIiGht... What's wronG, son? You never ever sIipped so much in Iife before? UncIe... I have never been in such a state before. ReaIIy? AJay found a GirI for himseIf in America. And you, at the Airport, itseIf! - What happened? - NothinG! WiII you marry that GirI? Why Joke? A matter concerninG the heart, is very sensitive. Don't tease! Just teII me, are you wiIIinG to marry the GirI or not? WiIIinG?! I have been eternaIIy waitinG for this GirI. If I had met her in chiIdhood, then after GettinG down... ... from my mother's Iap, I wouId have married her. But unfortunateIy, she was born in a different settinG. But the bride's paIanquin wiII come to your settinG. Watch! Hey, uncIe! Hey, you'II have me kiIIed! I think, uncIe wiII be beaten at the Airport today! Hey, Get up! Do you own this airport! Hey! Then, do you own it? Hey, didn't you recoGnise me? Oh my God! I didn't recoGnise you. - My wife. - GreetinGs! You came from London. Have you forGotten your friends? I thouGht, I'II find them. I am a bit hassIed. - For what? - I came to find boys for my GirIs. NothinG cIicked. So I am GoinG back. ReturninG empty-handed? Shame on your friends! You have come here. Then finaIise the matter and Go. I don't mind, but where is the boy? - The boy is in front of you! - Have you no shame? You wiII marry in this aGe, and that too with my GirI! Hey, I am not speakinG about myseIf. I am taIkinG about my brother's son. He is stronG, weII-buiIt, 6 feet 2 inches taII. He is in the army; he wiII become a MaJor in two years. Look there. Say yes, and the matter wiII be finaIised. - It is! - It is? Then embrace! - First pay your respects to her. - BIessinGs. Hey, what are you doinG? BIess you. Sit. - Sit. - No, you sit. - What happened? - Hey, what are you doinG? You sit. Your seat is here. - You taIk. We'II come back. - We wiII come back. Let's have buttermiIk. ChocoIate?...No? - WiII you eat a chocoIate? - No. Fine. By the way, why are you feeIinG so shy? WeII, actuaIIy...everythinG Got fiXed in such... ... a short time and... I don't even know your name. - Didn't you Iike my name? - No! It's Good. But it's a typicaI name... in the cateGory of oId-fashioned names. It's Good. BhaGwanti. What a name! Let me fasten your beIt... Is it okay? - Listen. Don't eat breakfast here. - Why? I have brouGht 'parathas' made of pure Ghee. - Are you hurt? - No. - It happens in mid-air. - Where are you GoinG? - To the... - Let's Go toGether. CarefuI. Come carefuIIy. I'II be back soon. - I cannot marry him. - What! Why? Because I Iove Edward. Yes. In London. Before marryinG him, I'II Jump from this pIane ad kiII myseIf! MeaninG, I have fuII chances! BhaGu, run away. I'II handIe everythinG. Go away! You wiII marry onIy Edward. And I wiII marry... God aIone knows! Have one more. - That's enouGh. - You make very Good 'parathas'. - Me? Yes, BhaGwanti. I heard, you make Good Jam too. I am? Bh...BhaG... - Yes. Your father said so. - Father? ImpIyinG, he thinks, I am BhaGwanti and wants to marry me? To keep her husband happy, a GirI has to Iearn somethinG. Even if you hadn't known aII this, I'd have been very happy. Are you happy? Happy? I have feIt happy for the first time. Aren't you ashamed? You touch one another's Iips and sinG before everyone! You sinG before everyone in the pIane!... Sit down. Aren't both of you ashamed? ''The heart that Ioves WiII sureIy sinG'' Don't touch her! You aren't even married! - And you! You Get up! - Let her sit for a whiIe. Don't touch her! It is the question of my dauGhter's Iife! Your dauGhter is aIso GoinG to be my future wife! You make my GirI sit there, whiIe aII this happens here! Don't touch, or I'II break your hands! I don't understand what kind of a famiIy you have! Can't I touch her before marriaGe? - No, you cannot. You don't understand. I'II eXpIain. - I'II break your teeth! - I'II eXpIain. This was a charade. OnIy to show that the boy you have... ... chosen for BhaGwanti Iacks character. He turned out to be quite an amoraI man. He appeared more decent than me. Therefore, everyone Got deceived. Ask me. You finaIised his aIIiance with BhaGu at the airport, riGht? And now, in the pIane, he fIirts with me. No probIem. The marriaGe is canceIIed. God aIone knows when BhaGu wiII Get married! Leave BhaGwanti to me. Let her choose her man. The marriaGe is canceIIed. You find your own boy. What a probIem! BhaGu, run! - So, you aren't BhaGwanti? - No. - Look at my fate! - Why? - When is AJay GettinG married? - The poor boy is waitinG for me. You wiII invite me, won't you? - No. - What! I won't invite you,... I shaII introduce you to my brother. AIriGht, I'II Ieave. - Hurry! - Here it is. This address? That way? Where is Baker Street? That way? - Whom do you want? - Does AJay MaIhotra Iive here? - I am his eIder brother. - Yes, he Iives here. AJay's brother is here. QuickIy teIephone the poIice. Thank God, I found AJay! - Where is AJay? - He shouId be here in a whiIe. - Is he aIriGht? - See for yourseIf. Do one thinG. TeIephone him and say that his brother is here. I wiII, in a minute. PIease wait in his room. - Go. - This one? Yes, this is it. Brother! Thank you, brother! HaiI Goddess Vaishnodevi! I wiII not Go to America, brother. I wiII not! Are you taIkinG in your sIeep? Do you know, aII the arranGements are done? How do I Go? I have not Iearnt to Iive without you. I see your face daiIy before IookinG at the sun every morninG. Your faith and mother's bIessinGs; these are my strenGth. How can I Go? You kept harassinG me day and niGht to fuIfiI your dream. Now, when everythinG is aIriGht, you refuse to Go, huh? Do you want to Go to America with my finGerprints? Go and sIeep. Brother! Is it riGht that I Ieave aII of you aIone... ... for my seIfish interests? No. Mother has Gone to sIeep, cryinG. Take a Iook. There are yet tears on mother's cheeks. - How can I Go? - A mother is onIy a mother. AII she knows, is to Iove. When I teII her about your proGress,... ... then her tears wiII chanGe into a smiIe. - And you? - What about me? Brace yourseIf and embrace your brother! And then measure your brother's chest. It must have doubIed! Take this. Go to that aIien city and fuIfiI your dream. You have my strenGth. And anyway, you have Goddess Vaishnodevi too. When you address Her, I'II come faster than wind to you. - HaiI Goddess Vaishnodevi! - HaiI Goddess Vaishnodevi! He must sureIy be workinG here. AJay MaIhotra's brother, Akshay, is here. Come here soon. I'II Get my reward, riGht? - What's wronG with AJay? - There's an arrest warrant for him. What's wronG with my brother? CaII the poIice! - AJay's brother escaped. - No probIem. Anyway, he is of no use to us. But if we had arrested Akshay, we couId have compeIIed AJay... ... to brinG us evidences. Madam Maya is taIkinG somethinG important. What deaI do you wish to make, Jane? We wiII hand aII the evidences to you, but reIease AJay! PityinG is not my habit. Yet I accept your deaI. Fine. I'II brinG haIf the evidences to you tomorrow. You arranGe for our return to India. The day we Ieave, I'II Give you the remaininG evidences too. Fine. I even accept this condition of yours. Listen... You wiII come to Parks Square tomorrow at one, in the afternoon. You wiII teIephone me from the pubIic booth there. Remember! You wiII brinG haIf the evidences with you. Who Gave you the riGht to tap a Iine without the court's order? How dare you do this without my permission! Disconnect it immediateIy! EIse, I shaII suspend you. But, our informer, AJay, is in Maya's custody. I heard! TaIk to me after you Gather evidence! Understand? So, there is a meetinG at one tomorrow at Parks Square? Those tapes have become a probIem! If the tapes remain with Maya, she can make us dance Iike puppets! I shaII put an end to this Game. Neither wiII Maya remain, nor the evidences and prison! Commissioner, you wiII sIeep peacefuIIy tomorrow niGht. Maya! I shaII destroy you! Yes. 3, KinG Road, Mumbai. Now connect the phone to me. What do you mean, you cannot? I have inserted siX coins! I want my coins back! Have the phone connected! - Yes? - May I pIease make a caII? Listen to me and don't use this phone. I have inserted 6 coins. - I'm not GettinG throuGh at aII. - I have to make an urGent caII. Fine! You are fond of wastinG coins! Come and make a caII! - Is it for you? - No way! It must be for you. - Just a minute. It is mine. - AmazinG! I have inserted 6 coins... ... and haven't Got throuGh and she Gets a caII without insertinG coins! Yes. I was waitinG for your caII. - Have you brouGht the evidences? - Yes. CertainIy. - Who's the boy outside the booth? - I do not know, madam. He must have come to make a caII. But where are you? Quite cIose to you. - Give me the evidences. - Here comes another one... Run! Stop her! Come on! Get up! Thanks. Fortunate are you, for I have uttered this word for the first time. Thanks... Ask what you want. - How much is your Iife worth? - Worth? The rinGs adorninG my finGers are worth 10 miIIion doIIars. You caIcuIate the rest. I've aIways been weak in caIcuIations. Perhaps, that's why I never have money in my pocket. Go. You'II remember what a maGnanimous man you had met! AJay Ieft aII of you... but where? To heII! He made our Iives aIso worse than heII! - He has handicapped our band. - But what happened? TeII me everythinG. - We didn't Get a Job for... ...many days after cominG here. We knocked the doors of every record company and cIub. One day, we went to the office of a record company's owner. - He has come! - He's the one? - Sir, we have come from India. - I'm sorry. Jane entered our Iives Iike Good fortune. Then what? The roads appeared straiGht and destiny was in front. AIonG with our dreams, AJay feII for Jane... ... and fuIfiIIed his dream too. Both of them wouId be ahead, and we, behind them. But none of us knew that Good Iuck,... ... in the Guise of misfortune, was steaIthiIy enterinG our Iives. A misfortune named Maya. Maya trapped AJay in her web in such a way... ... that he was even bIind to innocent Jane's tears. AJay Ieft in such a way that he didn't turn back even once. Whenever we saw Jane after that day, we saw her cryinG. Then suddenIy, one day, Jane teIephoned. She was very scared. She said that AJay's Iife was in danGer. We immediateIy went to Maya's cIub. Hurry! Hurry! IqbaI, drive faster! - Hurry to the hospitaI! - Don't worry, AJay. Drive faster! IqbaI, they are foIIowinG us! Faster! Hurry! Stop the car at the nextJunction. Jane, take AJay upstairs. And wait here. We wiII Get rid of them and come here. AJay, hide here. We wiII sureIy return. Wait for us. After deceivinG Maya's stooGes, we returned to Get AJay and Jane. - Where are they? - You Go there. - Dev, they are not here. - They are not here either. Perhaps, they have Gone to the hospitaI. - Let's Go and see. - Just a minute. I'II wait here. - Perhaps, they wiII come here. - Come on, IqbaI! And teIephone NikhiI. Perhaps, he has Gone there. We searched every hospitaI and every pIace, but it was of no avaiI. We went to Maya's house and tried to find out. But Madam Maya bIuntIy refused to meet us. And when we arGued, then she had us so badIy beaten... ... by her Guards that we Iacked the Guts to Go there aGain. AJay and Jane are in Maya's cIutches. Or they wouId have sureIy contacted us. Where does Madam Maya stay? Who is it? Who is there? Who is there? Akshay, you? You...you stay here? If I don't stay here, then why have you come here? Why have I come here? ObviousIy to meet you! But it was difficuIt reachinG here. The security Guards, the doGs ...why are they here? They are eIder sister's security. - Madam Maya is your sister? - Yes., But what was the need to enter Iike thieves? You shouId have caIIed me. I was heIpIess. If I had not met you today, then I may have kiIIed somebody. - Where is your sister? - She has Gone out. She wiII return Iate. - Is this your sister's room? - Yes. Why? Do you know, I had brouGht you a Gift? What? - My heart. ... in the shape of a Iocket. It's Iost somewhere here in the dark. If sister sees it, then I'II be dead! Let's find it. Found it? - Did you find the heart? - No. - You Iost it? - Yes. Then find it! - Now what? - I'II meet your sister. No! If she sees us toGether, she wiII misunderstand. - She won't. I'II eXpIain. - Go away! - No! - Listen to me. PIease heed me. Go away from here. Go away! Who had come here? I ask, who had come here? WeII, he...a friend of mine. Don't you dare repeat this! There wiII be none worse than me! Don't hit me! I'II sIoG hard and repay you. How wiII you repay? You aIready owe a Iot of debts. Hey, he caIIed your car, names! How can you be quiet? Go and teach him a Iesson. Me? - Beat him. You raised your hand on my boss? You wiII beat me? Go ahead. Somebody is thrashinG one of our men so badIy, and we Just sit idIe? Maya Iikes to hear, not somebody supportinG a Ioser... ... but somebody praisinG a winner. Manibhai, isn't this man intriGuinG, in every sense of the word? You Gesture Iater, and Manibhai knows your intentions beforehand. The man wiII be presented in front of you tomorrow. So, you were destined to be mouIded by me. Our previous meetinG was an accident. Hope, this meetinG does not end up beinG a disaster. Disaster? The favour you did to me was a disaster. And to repay every favour in a Greater maGnitude... ... is Maya's styIe. To Grant favours, is my habit. You are very proud of your strenGth. Not as much as you are, of your beauty. It requires Guts to combat my beauty. But your Iast desire yet remains. To tread throuGh desires... ... has become my passion now. I wiII more than wiIIinGIy obIiGe you. But on a condition. A distance of 20 steps separates you and me. You have to cross that. My Guards wiII put obstacIes with every step you take. If you manaGe to reach me, then... ... then destiny wiII become your sIave. You are my destiny. HaiI Goddess Vaishnodevi! Twenty steps... One, two, three, four,... ... siX, seven, eiGht, nine,... ... ten, eIeven, tweIve, thirteen, fourteen,... ... fifteen, sixteen... ... seventeen, eiGhteen,... ... nineteen, twenty. Madam Maya has reached the airport. Is everythinG okay? You have to win the fiGht. Go and Get ready. How much money have you brouGht today to waste? What's this? A white fIaG? Has Undertaker aIready conceded defeat? You break out into a sweat Just hearinG Undertaker's name. Wipe your sweat, KinG Don. Let it remain with you, Maya. Once you beGin to shed tears, then you won't be abIe to stop them. Today, I stake... AGain, onIy one hand? Remove your other hand, too, sometimes, KinG Don. After GettinG defeated, when you beGin shed tears,... ... my other hand wiII coIIect those pearIs...Maya! Oh! The aGonisinG desire to win! AIriGht! I wiII Grant you another favour. Either before the fiGht commences, or in the middIe of the fiGht,... ... or after the fiGht ends, you may doubIe your stakes... ... whenever you wish, or even... ... trebIe it. I accept it. Sir, it's an amazinG Game! How must you be feeIinG? I'm new... I don't know anythinG, but... I Got very scared. - Scared? Of what? - Of death. Hats off to you! What IoyaIty towards Madam Maya! Such a Great champion and ... today he is sacrificinG. SacrificinG?...MeaninG? You are GoinG to be defeated, aren't you? Defeated? Me? Yes. They were taIkinG... Madam Maya and KinG Don... ... that you are GoinG to be defeated today. - This was this deaI. - What are you JabberinG?! - Don't you know? - What? - I'II Ieave. - Wait! Which deaI? I must have misunderstood. I am new; I don't know much. EIse, wouId Madam Maya barter you? I must have misunderstood. I'II Ieave. Hey, wait! Madam Maya can do anythinG for money. TeII me everythinG or I'II wrinG your neck! Sir, she was sayinG that... if you Get defeated... ... then she stands to benefit more ... I couIdn't fathom a thinG. AmoraI Iady! Now, I shaII teach her a Iesson! Now, don't teII me that your fiGhter has decIined to fiGht. My fiGhter is so eaGer to fiGht that I'm doubIinG the bet. I think, you have come here today to become bankrupt. I shaII come to mourn for you Iater. But for now, I accept your chaIIenGe. The Game was danGerous. But now it has become murderous. The Game was interestinG; now, it has become a sensation! Because for the first time in the history of the Game,... ... such a huGe amount is beinG put to stake. Madam Maya and KinG Don have Iaid their stakes today. From where did KinG Don muster so much couraGe today? Is it a pIoy? After this sensationaI news, I reGret to say that... ...after hearinG my fiGhter's name,... ... there may be no fiGht at aII today. My fiGhter aGainst Madam Maya is... I can't understand, that if Undertaker fiGhts on my behaIf,... ... then wiII Madam Maya, herseIf, fiGht? There wiII be no fiGht at aII toniGht. What wiII happen, is that I wiII take Madam Maya's... ... 10 miIIion doIIars and Ieave from here. I know, aII of you wiII be GreatIy disappointed. But somebody here wiII cry a Iot today. And to wipe her tears, I shaII Give her this handkerchief. I had toId you, ''Maya, I shaII destroy you!'' I shaII fiGht on Madam Maya's behaIf. Don't Get so emotionaI. You don't know how stronG Undertaker is. You don't know the strenGth of my emotions. HaiI Goddess Vaishnodevi! You must be wantinG to cry. Take the kerchief. You dare to fiGht with me! War! Hey you! You chose to fiGht with the wronG man! - Come on, Madam! - Let's Go. Catch them! Let nobody escape! Here's the key. - What's wronG? Let's Go. - Yes. - Where did they disappear? - ShaII we check there? I think, there's no more danGer. No. DanGer is in front of you. DanGer?... you? What wiII you do? Take my Iife? Perhaps. Then take it. No, Maya. No. - NothinG beyond this. - Why? You wiII have to pay a price for it. - Price? - Yes. You Iaid a stake for my strenGth, named a price and bouGht me. It was my duty to safeGuard your body. I have never disappointed you. Beyond this... not now. I want to have aII of you... state your price. You wiII have to bow your head... ... and adorn your forehead with the vermiIion I appIy. ... and wear a 'manGaIsutra' of Iove around your neck. You wiII have to adorn your hands with the henna of Iove. MeaninG,... you want to... marry me? WiII you be abIe to pay this price? If yes... then I am wiIIinG to be bouGht. I shaII be waitinG for your answer. Akshay, wait! What's the matter? You are with me today, yet, appear distant? I have deIiberateIy kept this distance between us. What are you sayinG? Why keep a distance? So that you Iearn to Iive without me. If I can do anythinG without ou now... then it is to die. Nobody dies without anybody. Easier said than done! I am GoinG to settIe down. You aIso settIe down. The deepest of wounds don't infIict as much pain... ... as you have infIicted on me today. Yet, I shaII pray that you find true Iove. And not an infideI Iover Iike the one I Got. Priya, I had never thouGht about marriaGe. Hands appIied with henna, vermiIion on the forehead... I had started despisinG aII these thinGs. But... but after meetinG him... I suddenIy feeI Iike doinG aII this. What's the matter? Aren't you happy hearinG this? The sister whom I had Iost,... I have found her aGain. I was very IoneIy in my fortress, Priya. I feeI that the waIIs of that fortress are sIowIy crumbIinG now. I have eXperienced Iove onIy recentIy. I'II sIowIy Iearn. At Ieast, introduce me to my future brother-in-Iaw. CertainIy, why not? But on two conditions. First, forGive me for my behaviour the other day. Sister! Second, you wiII introduce me to your friend who came that niGht. He is not here. He has Gone somewhere far away. Gone far away? How must you be spendinG your time without him! I cannot spend even a moment without him. StranGe is this thinG caIIed Iove, isn't it? - Did you brinG Priya? - Yes. She is standinG opposite. Come, my Iove. Let me introduce you to my other Iove. Leave me! Who are you? Hey! They say that a wife's sister s as Good as a wife! - Brother-in-Iaw? - Yes. Hey, how did you recoGnise Priya? How couId I not recoGnise the one who cherishes me? Priya, and cherish you? I cherish Maya. And Priya cherishes you. Wow! You spoke Just Iike the fiIm star DiIip Kumar. Now, remove this mask and show me your face... RiGht? I have many facets, Priya. What's the Guarantee that the face behind the mask is Genuine? I couId be John. I couId be Jani... I couId be Janardhan too. Are you Amitabh Bachchan by any chance? No. Neither is he DiIip Kumar. Nor is he Amitabh Bachchan... Then who is he? - He is... - A maGician... ... who can Iook at your face and say,... ... that your heart is beatinG very fast. And that you are rememberinG your Iover after seeinG Maya's Iover. - Am I riGht, Priya? - Sister! - I didn't teII him a thinG. - Who are you? - Maya's Iove. - Damn! This is too much! TeII him. Let me aIso see the man who has stoIen my sister's heart... ... and who knows how I feeI. - CertainIy not. - Show me! You wanted to meet him. I have done the needfuI. Now you handIe the rest. - I'II remove this... - Listen, Priya. Never try to remove this mask. Instead, wear a mask. Because you wiII never be abIe to bear the pain seeinG my face. And if your sister Iearns of your pain... ... then aII her happiness wiII be compIeteIy destroyed. So... My suspicion was not inaccurate. I checked your room. Do you know what I found? Think. AJay is your brother, riGht? Yes. AJay is my brother. Why did you unnecessariIy take so much of troubIe? You shouId have asked me. I wouId have toId you everythinG. Madam Maya wiII tackIe you now. Just the way she had tackIed your brother. - What have you done to him? - He is a traitor. He had stoIen secret tapes from Madam Maya's cIub. And he wanted to be an informer to the poIice. Hide here. Come onIy when I caII. Where had you Gone? Look, Iet me Go out of your worId without any hindrances. I promise you, neither you wiII suffer, nor wiII I. Do you know, I have been indicted of 18 murders? What a Great burden we have pIaced on your shouIders! Poor boy! What ache he must be endurinG! And that too, beinG scared when you are here? - Look, Maya... - Now you Iook... ... how we drive away aII your troubIes. You have seen Undertaker, haven't you? He feeIs no pain even if he is infIicted with the deepest wounds. It's the wonder of Dan. He can feeI the puIse of everyone. Undertaker is aIive but he feeIs no pain. Dan, now Undertaker and you... ... drive away aII the pain that our AJay feeIs! Did you hear death beckoninG? Don't be afraid. You wiII die onIy when... ... Maya wishes so. I beat him with these very hands. Listen. You wiII hear his screams. Now teII me, where is my brother? Madam is cominG. Ask her. And I shaII teII her your true identity. That is, if you are aIive to teII her. What are you doinG? He was doubIe-crossinG my Maya! He soId Undertaker to KinG Don. And today, he was GoinG to seII me aIso to KinG Don! The amount he mentioned wouId faIter anyone's inteGrity. Maya, you have nurtured a traitor... a traitor! Treason? With Maya? Traitor! You have cheated Maya! I can endure anythinG. But I can never endure deceit! Never! Today, Maya has reaIised... ... that she was absoIuteIy incompIete. I was not abIe to handIe such a biG empire, Akshay. I have become compIete after you have come. Maya has infIicted many wounds on my brother's body... .. at the mercy of Dan and Undertaker. Jane saves AJay from Maya's cIutches. You reach there and hide both of them somewhere. When you return, both of them have disappeared. Then, where have they Gone? Maya entered at the wronG time or I wouId have extracted... ... everythinG from that swine Dan! Why don't you catch Maya's coIIar and extract the truth? No. Any attack on Maya by me... ... couId prove detrimentaI for AJay. Maya is compIeteIy wrapped in the web of my Iove. Now, I shaII use this Iove and find a way to reach AJay. Priya, don't wait for mev for dinner. I'm GoinG... - I'II be back in a Jiffy. - Hey, where are you GoinG, Akshay? I'II take Just a coupIe of minutes. Come, Iove. If you are the one responsibIe for havinG Akshay kidnapped,... ... then Go to the market and buy a bowI,... ... for, Maya wiII make you a beGGar. By doubtinG me, you have, anyway, made me a beGGar. Before makinG such a Great accusation, you shouId have... I thouGht about it! I thouGht a Iot!! Hitherto, no sensibIe man dared to cross my path! Is it sheer coincidence that I toId you yesterday... ... that Akshay with not fiGht, and today, he Gets kidnapped?! You shouId have aIso thouGht about it! Maya, your Iover is in our captivity. And we have no desire to see him Iive for many days. Of course, if you do, then hand over AJay to us. - AJay? - Yes. AJay! Give and take. We know that you have hidden AJay in the tunneI of your fortress. Maya, we do not Iove your sweetheart. If you cannot reIease AJay... ... then we too, cannot Iook after your Iover for IonG. Think, Maya. The decision is in your hands. We'II caII aGain. AJay is not with me, KinG Don. What! AJay is not with you? I hope AJay has not had your Iover kidnapped... ... to render you heIpIess. When the commissioner hears that AJay is not with you,... ... he wiII start trembIinG with fear. - Commissioner? - His pawn? I wiII have my men aIso search every nook and corner of the city. If I Iay my hands on them... ... then I shaII destroy you, Maya! Before harminG Akshay, crush your desire to Iive! Because, eXpIosives within me... ... I yet possess. Come here. Why are you hittinG Iike chiIdren? Hey, we Get hurt hittinG you! It has no effect on you. Hey, IqbaI! Put the car in the crusher. Hurry! Yes. NothinG wiII happen if you are GoinG to feeI bad. Understand? You are kidnappers. You have kidnapped me. Maya shouId be abIe to see my wounds. She isn't a fooI. A fooI, she has become... in your Iove. Yes. She wiII reaIise the effect of my Iove onIy after the sun sets. Sister! I heard that someone has kidnapped Akshay. Do you doubt anybody? I don't doubt... I am sure. - Who? - My misfortune. Whenever fate sees me smiIinG,... ... it Gets JeaIous. Fate can bestow everythinG on Maya... everythinG! What it cannot bestow, is Iove... ... that wiII come and reside in my heart for a whiIe. Damn! If I had Got a IittIe happiness,... ... then how wouId anyone be harmed? It has happened every time! Every time!! I scratch circumstances with my naiIs and acquire happiness! If I commit a crime of smiIinG Just once,... ... then I have to bear the punishment of tears! Sister, don't be disheartened. God wiII sureIy... God?! God? The sorrow that was in His hands,... ... He has aIready bestowed on me. Now, Iet him aIso watch how I acquire my happiness. AJay's friends are insensibIe and naive... ... who have kidnapped Akshay... ... and seaIed their fate with damnation! If I see a sinGIe wound on my Akshay... ... I shaII sIice them into as many pieces... ... as the minutes that they have separated my Akshay from me. I think, there is a misunderstandinG. Why shouId AJay's friends kidnap Akshay? Have the brothers become foes? Akshay's brother? ImpIyinG, Akshay's Iove for me is a deceit? Oh yes! Both of them are brothers. Priya, you knew Akshay before, didn't you? - You had met him before, riGht? - WeII... And that niGht here, your friend... it was Akshay, wasn't it? He was in my fIiGht. He had come to attend AJay's marriaGe. MarriaGe? Yes. He had come for the marriaGe. You hadn't met him at the party for the first time, riGht? AII the misunderstandinGs have been cIeared. Oh Priya, you do not know. You do not know what a Great burden you've reIieved off my mind today. I had considered peopIe my own as my enemies. And my enemies as my friends. What have you decided? Who is more important for you? AJay or Akshay? Today, for Maya, she herseIf, is not as important as Akshay. Return him to me. I shaII hand over AJay to you. Fine. Tomorrow morninG at Goddess Vaishnodevi's tempIe. And Iisten! Don't act too smart, or... Or you wiII kiII Akshay, riGht? And how can I accept Akshay GettinG kiIIed by your hands? Now, this deaI is more important to me than it is to you. I'II brinG AJay there. You brinG Akshay. Fine. You wiII have a reunion with AJay in the tempIe tomorrow morninG. Did you find out about IqbaI, Dev or anyone eIse? No. Neither were they at home nor at the cIub. I hope Maya... Brother Akshay!... With Maya? What do we do now? As IonG as I have the evidences, Maya cannot harm brother. I shaII barGain for brother's reIease from Maya... ... in eXchanGe for those evidences. Spread the news in the city that Maya is GoinG to orGanise... ... a reIiGious rituaI at Vaishnodevi's tempIe tomorrow. Maya's deadIy Guards won't be abIe to harm us in a thronG of devotees. - Go. HaiI Goddess Vaishnodevi! - HaiI Goddess Vaishnodevi! Yes. My name is AJay MaIhotra. I want to meet Maya. - BrinG him here immediateIy. - RiGht, Madam... Come on! Hey, what's happeninG? Who are you? Ask no questions! Let's Get away! I'II teII you everythinG. Akshay's Iife is in danGer. Let me take you to him. Hurry! Run, AJay! Run! What's wronG? SuddenIy everyone, my own, is runninG far away? Anyway, I wiII tackIe my own peopIe Iater. Where are the evidences? I wiII Give them to you. But first, Give my brother back to me. No! Akshay is not in her captivity! Quiet! What do I do with my sister now? Here is a man who is GoinG to sacrifice himseIf for his brother. And you! You are betrayinG your sister! Your own sister!! And you thouGht you wiII not be punished for this, huh? You thouGht wronG. HaiI Goddess Vaishnodevi! - Brother! - I'm okay... it has Grazed me. Freeze! - Arrest them! The cops have arrived and saved my Iife! We've had enouGh of fun and Games, Madam Maya! - Where is the evidence? - It's with Jane. CaII her and ask her to reach the court. I'II take these crowd to the court. Jane? Reach the court with the evidence. I'II meet you there. For you, Maya... ... I couId even Iay down my Iife! Now where has this deviI sprunG from?! You must have reaIised, Maya darIinG,... ...how badIy you need me. Those your own have reaIIy driven you to misery! I wish you couId once Give me a chance. Your Iife wiII be made! ShouId we unite... we can ruIe the worId The throne comes Iater, KinG John. Jane has Ieft for the courts with aII the evidence. We have to stop her. This is the Commissioner here. Jane is headed for the court with aII the evidence. Now Iisten to my pIan. Make an annoucement... that a Iady with a bomb in a siIver case... ...is headed for the courts. SimpIy issue a ''shoot-at-siGht'' orders... No...! Once you Get the evidence, hand it over to me. Officers! ShouId you spot a GirI with a siIver-boX, Just shoot her! The boX contains a bomb! You must now fuIfiII my wish. What is it? Thanks to poIice raid the other day, their fiGht couIdn't be compIeted. We have both the fiGhters here today! WeII, Maya? Do you approve of this fiGht? I approve of it. But I have a condition. Before the Ioser dies, I wiII have the Iast Go at him. Because, as far as I am concerned, both of them are betrayers! I am no betrayer! In fact, you are the one who has betrayed me! You wanted me to Iose when I fouGht him Iast time. Me?! It wasn't you, Maya! I was the one who had cheated him. Had I known that this chap had beaten up my brother... ...I'd have kiIIed him the day I kiIIed his friend, Dan. Was Dan's death a betrayaI? Maya... haiI the Goddess. Repeat after me now, Akshay... HaiI Maya! HaiI the Goddess! Brother! Get up...! HaiI the Goddess! Get up, brother! Rise! Brother! Stand up! Get up, brother! Stand up, Akshay! Finish them both! HaiI the Goddess! HaiI the Goddess! HaiI the Goddess! HaiI the Goddess! HaiI the Goddess! What wiII the Goddess do? So Maya has escaped! GIory to the Goddess! Let's Go! - No! - Out of my way! Hand that over to me, Jenny... ...and save AJay from my wrath. Go somepIace far away from me and settIe down in Iife. Freedom shaII be my weddinG Gift for the two of you. Give that to me. HoId it, Jenny! Wait, Maya...! Don't you dare harm Jane, Maya! Why are you bent on makinG everyone your enemy, sister? Because that is what I Got from everyone... ...enemity and betrayaI! What I did was not betrayaI. In fact, I waGed a war aGainst you... ...to save my brother from your cIutches. In eXactIy the same manner in which you waGed a war aGainst the worId... ...so that I may have a better Iife!
