The hero of a generation, equally known for his swashbuckling in public and in private. He died true to form, in the arms of a much younger girlfriend. Now, all of America is asking, "Who is the girl?" Just got a few questions out here. Just a couple questions. All right, first let's all just move back and give Miss Aadland some room, would you, please? - Miss Aadland! - Miss Aadland! There she is! Is it true that Errol Flynn died in your arms? - What were his last words? - How long had you known him? Miss Aadland, are you going to the funeral? Miss Aadland, did Flynn leave you anything in his will? Miss Aadland! - Beverly! - How old are you? - Bev! - Are you going to the funeral? Beverly. Miss Aadland, what were you doing in Vancouver? Don't push! Don't push! - She's gonna faint. - Beverly! Please, just get back! Hey! Beverly! What was your relationship... The girl fainted. Yeah, it's a pretty crazy scene over here. Hey, let me call you back later. Excuse me, ma'am. - Are you the mother? - Yes. Hi, I'm Tedd Thomey, here's my card. I was wondering if you could just... - A few questions about your daughter? - I'm in a hurry. I... Is it true that she was mentioned in the will? Well, he wanted to make sure she was very well looked after. Well, do you think she's pregnant? - Pregnant? - We just saw her faint. We're talking a big age difference here, do you think that they were in love? Oh, head over heels in love, yes. I mean, it was her first love, and his last. I couldn't have done anything to stop it, even if I wanted to. It was all predestined. Mrs. Aadland, look this way. Here, take this. And dab your eye. - Looks great. Thanks. - Do you need another one? - Baby, are you close? - Going as fast as I can. - Let me see. - Hold on. I thought we agreed on the bolero dress, the Paula Lynn. What's wrong with this? Nothing. It's adorable, but it makes you look too young. Trust me. Now, this is much better. - They're here already. - All right, Herb. Here you go. I've canceled your dance class for the next three weeks. But you can still make the acting class as long as you don't go over time. - Do I have to? - Yes, you do. I said I'd go bowling with some of the gang. Well, never mind about that. You know, Mrs. Morgan is so excited. She couldn't believe when I told her that you were in a movie with Gene Kelly. - I'm only in the chorus line. - I know, but that's just for now. I mean, what's that Natalie Wood girl have, that you don't have? - Cab's waiting. - All right, Herb. - Now, remember your manners... - But don't fade into the woodwork. That's my girl. Beautiful. - Bye bye. - Bye, sweetie. Excuse me, may I talk to you for a moment? Sure. - How do you do? - Very well, thank you. I'm Orry Kelly, doing costumes on Too Much, Too Soon over on stage eight, and there's a certain someone over there, who would very much like to meet you. - Who? - Errol Flynn. You know who he is, don't you? Sure. Robin Hood. - Are you decent? - Never, come in. Hello, there. I'm Errol Flynn, and who might you be? I'm Beverly Aadland. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. And what exactly do you do, Miss Aadland? Actor, singer, dancer. Really? All three, that's extraordinary. Triple threat, yes. I envy you, I never could dance myself. - Or sing. - Or act. How long have you been in this profession, Miss Aadland? Forever, pretty much. - A seasoned professional. - I guess. - I'd better be going. - What? No, no, no, no. Stay, Orry. Stay. Isn't she an exquisite creature? She'd be perfect, don't you think? Yes. Yes, Errol. Perfect. Aadland residence. - Hi, Mom. - Hi. I can't make acting class tonight. I have an audition. - What kind of an audition? - It's for a play. "Master of" something. It's with Errol Flynn. - Who? - Errol Flynn. - Don't be nervous, just be yourself. - Okay. - And don't smoke in front of him. - Okay, Mom. - Be a good listener. - Okay, okay. - Okay. - Bye. Bye. - Would you care for one? - No, thanks. You'll get a kick out of this lodge where we're going. It's a... It belongs to Huntington Hartford, he's the producer of the play. Yes, my wife and I are separated. And he took pity on this homeless vagabond. I'll be sad to leave it. Every good, true vigorous feeling I have, gathers impulsively around him. I know, I must conceal my sentiments. I must smother hope. I must remember that he cannot care much for me. I must repeat continually, that we are forever sun... sunder... - Sundered! - Sundered. - Sundered. - Very good. Very good, indeed. Do you like that speech? Well... I think it's kind of corny. It is, isn't it? Come on. There must have been something that made you feel suspicious. Well, if it turns out to be one of us, I'm gonna wring his rotten red neck. - Yeah, maybe you are wringing it. - I'll get it. I'm a first class United States American, see? Don't even hint I got... - Aadland residence. - Hi, Mom. - How's it going? - Everything's fine, we're having dinner. Dinner? Well, then the audition must have gone very well. Yeah, I guess. It's just the two of you, he's not getting any funny ideas, is he? Mom, of course not. You come straight home afterwards. Okay, there's someone who wants to say hello to you. Hello, is this the charming mother of a very charming young lady? I'd recognize that voice anywhere. Very nice to meet you over the phone, Mrs. Aadland. I would love to meet you in person, though. Perhaps you could come round to the lodge, sometime next week. Thank you. That sounds lovely. Wonderful. I'll have my man call you and make all the arrangements. - It's a plan. - Who is it? It's the producer of the play. What the hell play is auditioning at this hour? We're chasing... Are you sure you won't have some champagne? It'll make the movie go down much easier. No, thank you. Okay, maybe I will. All right. You've seen it this color before? Millions of times. - Millions? - It's a figure of speech. You're like a little sprite. You know that? A wood nymph. Has anyone ever told you that? - No. - Oh, definitely. Yes, in fact, I think I'm going to call you Woodsey. - Do you like that? - I don't know. Would you think about it and let me know? - Thanks, Woodsey. - I didn't say "yes," yet. But it's such a perfect name for you. Woodsey. I don't think so. Oh, Woodsey, you have to face your destiny. My destiny. You're extraordinary. Errol. You got any smokes? No. There's a gas station down on Sunset. - Can we stop? - Sure. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Is he like that with all the girls? What do you mean? That's what I thought. Oh, baby, I was so worried. - Hi. - How was it? Oh, it was fine. - Yeah? - I don't think I got the part, though. Why do you say that? He took you to dinner, you must be in the running. - I guess. - So what's he like, Errol Flynn? He was nice. He talked a lot. - And were you a good listener? - Yes, I was. But I'll talk to you about it later, I'm really tired. I've seen all your movies. The Sea Hawk was my favorite. I saw it, like, five times. Really? I could barely get through it once. Oh, but you're such a great actor, Mr. Flynn. Thank you. Woodsey, I've been looking for you all day. I wanted to ask you out for dinner, if you... Look, I'm terribly sorry that things got so out of hand at the audition. Is that what it was? An audition? Look, I'm so sorry. I mistook you completely. - I didn't realize... - I'm late. Well, why haven't you seen him? He's on a different soundstage. Well, when you do see him, I want you to remind him that I'm very excited about meeting him. - He did say he wanted to meet me. - Okay. Yeah, okay. Well... Make sure that you have lunch, you're getting too skinny. One and two and three and four. One and two and three and four. Sorry to intrude, ladies. Now at last I find out where you've been hiding. I was hoping to have a word with Miss Aadland. If you don't mind. Excuse us, please. Who was that? Here. Beverly, I can't stop thinking about you. I lie awake, nights. Really. I... I haven't slept in days. I don't understand what the point is. You already got what you wanted. What I want is to get to know you, to spend time with you, enjoy your company, that's all. Look, I know my reputation precedes me, but I promise you, whatever you've read in the press, I swear, the man standing before you now, is a different animal entirely. Please, believe me. What's that? Oh, it's a... It's a question mark. Yes, I know. Why? Because I question everything. Even at my age, I'm still trying to figure it all out. I... just never believe what I've been told. Someone tells me, "You can't do that," I say, "Why the hell not?" And then I go ahead and bloody well do it, and I get into a bit of trouble. But I'm just endlessly curious. I'm especially curious about you. - Who is it? - Hi, Mrs. Aadland. It's Tedd Thomey. - If I could just ask you a few questions. - Why don't you all go to hell? It's Tedd Thomey, ma'am. We met at the airport. I gave you my card. Yeah, I'm not a reporter, I'm the guy that writes the books. Look, I know it's been a difficult time for you, ma'am. I'm a straight-up guy, I won't misrepresent you. Things have been so crazy since Errol died. It's been a very hard time for me. - I was very close to him, too, you know. - I can understand, yeah. - Are you okay? - Oh, I have an artificial leg. My so-called handicap in an accident, many years ago. I'm sorry. I assume you've been reading all the BS they've been printing. I mean, they just take your words and they twist them around until you say whatever it is they want you to say. - Yeah. That's the gutter press for you. - I know. I know, but... I'm worried that Bev will see it. Where is Beverly? She's... She's staying with Errol's lawyer. He has a real swanky pad with a gate and everything and... - it keeps the press away. - The press. You know what, Mrs. Aadland? Forget about what the press are saying. This book is the chance to tell your side of the story. It'll put it down for the record permanently. And I'm certain you have a great story to tell me. Okay, let's get started. Just speak normally, relax. I'm gonna start with a few questions here... Well, there's one thing I wanna make clear right off, and that is that my baby was a virgin the day she met Errol Flynn and nothing makes me sicker than those dried up old biddies who don't have any of the facts, but they make all these snide remarks and make it seem like my daughter, Beverly, was a bad girl for what she did with Errol, which... nothing could be further from the truth. And I ought to know, because I'm her mother and she told me everything. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. It's amazing. Woodsey, you realize you're bringing out my best work in years. These past few weeks, have been heaven. For me, anyway. I'm not complaining. So, you do like me, just a little? You're growing on me. You are a cheeky little wood nymph, aren't you? What time is your mother expecting you home? Not until 5:00. All right, that's good. You told her dance class again? I told her I had to stay and practice the new routine. Well, that's... that's true, isn't it? I need more practice. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. - Why not? - Oh, Woodsey, this is the monstrosity in love, lady, that the desire is boundless, and the act, a slave to limit. Who said that? William Shakespeare? Yes, how did you guess? It sounded corny. Yeah. You... Some say that happiness is hard to find Some say they'd never... Hey, Beverly. Did you go to Hollywood High? - Yeah. Why? - Nothing. Just drop you at the end of the street again? Sure. Some say that life is a mystery Some say that love brings only misery I felt the same thing And I thought it was true But that was before I met you Thanks, old boy. Errol? Well, it's just... It's about Beverly. It's just... I thought she looked familiar the first time I saw her, but I didn't say anything and now I realize that could have been a mistake. What is it, Ronnie? Just spit it out. She went to the same high school I did. But she wasn't in my grade, she was a couple grades below me. I'm sorry. I feel stupid, it took me so long to figure it out, but really, she seemed a lot older. I mean, she's really good at looking the part. I don't know why I didn't remember her sooner. Don't beat yourself up, Ronnie. It's not your job to monitor my love life. I know. Well, I'll be inside if you need anything. Right. Out of the blue, Errol called and he asked us up to the lodge. That's not the kind of invitation you get every day, I'll tell you. My husband Herb, was away on business, in Arizona. So, we didn't have any transport. But Errol, very gallantly, sent his car. - Mom. - What? - Come on. - Okay. - There you are, you made it. - Yeah. Beverly, how nice to see you again. And who is this, your sister? I've waited weeks for this, Mrs. Aadland. Oh, please, call me Flo. Flo it is then. Would you like a drink, Flo? Yes, please. I'll take a vodka on the rocks. Perfect. Vodka is also my poison of choice. Beverly, why don't you... Why don't you find a soda? It's in the kitchen, which is down the stairs and to the left. Okay. She's amazing, your daughter. I want you to tell me all about Beverly. She's been in show business for a while, hasn't she? Oh, she has been a pro since she was 12. Here, and in Vegas. She was the Pears Soap baby. And then at three, she won a contest for a knock-out impersonation of Bette Davis. "Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night?" It was, "I'd like to kiss you, but I just washed my hair." And then, five, her first film. The Story of Nylon, Technicolor. She's just... She was born to be a performer. You don't have to convince me, Flo. I saw it right away. She's one of the brightest, most unaffected, natural talents, I have seen in years. - Oh, please, sit down, won't you? - Oh, thank you. The thing is... If there's a way, I would really like to help her. - You know, get her career going full-steam. - Really? There's so many people in this town, friends of mine who have influence, you know, that I could introduce her to. And I could say, "This is my discovery. My protge, so to speak." That is, with your approval. - Of course. - Splendid. I never got you your drink. There is one thing, Florence. The other day, my assistant told me that... he thought he remembered Beverly from high school and that she's not yet 18. Is that true? Yes. - How old is she? - She's 15, Errol. You know, that could be very dangerous for Beverly. If the studios found out that she's underage, she could be blackballed. Blackballed? Oh, yes. They're real sticklers for the rules these days. Not like in my time. - Well, they won't find out. - No? No, she has a birth certificate that says she's 18. - It's a good one, too. - Is it? Yes, she was dancing in Vegas when she was 13 and no one ever suspected anything and she could pass for 20 now. Well, that's exactly the age I took her for. It occurs to me that if I were to take Woodsey under my wing, we'd naturally be seen around town a lot. And the press in this country, the free press is... Well, they have such filthy minds, they could make it rather difficult for us. - Even when nothing is going on? - Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Well, that's frustrating. I mean, that's not fair. No, it's not. But I've had an idea, Flo. What if you were to come along with us, when we're out? You know, be a part of the group. - Well, that's a swell idea. - You are her mother, after all. We'd just be... We'd just be three friends, out on the town, having a wonderful time. Well, that sounds like fun. Splendid. Are you out of your fucking mind? Yeah, you bet. And loving every minute of it. Does the mother even know what's going on? Well, you know, mothers see what mothers want to see. Here you are, sport. Oh, you're flying too close to the sun, my friend. Your wings will get burned, you're gonna fall down to earth, and you're gonna land in this nasty little place called jail, which you barely escaped in '42. That was a show trial, I was a big star then, I'm not anymore, so the DA doesn't care about me. And I don't give a damn about him. And besides, Beverly is not a gold digger, like those girls were. But she is underage and the public never forgets. You don't have to remind me, sport. I live with it every day. "In like Flynn." It'll be my epitaph. That's exactly why they're gonna throw the book at you. And the studio can't protect you anymore. Belli, you're a lawyer and I pay you quite handsomely to think like that. But at the end of the day, I don't give a damn. Do you know what doctor once told me, that if I didn't give up the drink and the drugs and the wild ways, I'll have six months to live. That was 10 years ago, and I've lived every day and night as if it was my last. That's what I love about you, Baron. I really do. But now you're gonna listen to me. Statutory rape, that's hard time. Look at that... I began to see that there was a real chemistry between Errol and Beverly. He was so eager to please her, to do things for her like she was a big star and he was her youthful admirer. I went everywhere with them and met the best Hollywood had to offer. The crme de la crme. - Hello? - Hello, Woodsey. Oh, hi, Errol, I love the music box, it's so sweet. I'm so glad. Something about it made me think of you. Listen, my love, is this is a good time? - Sure. - Put her on. Mom, pick up. Hello. Florence, hi. Listen, I hope I'm not interrupting your dinner. Oh. No, no, not at all, we just finished. How are you? Bev, hang up the phone. How are you doing? Not well, Florence, not well at all. I have to leave on Monday for New York. - Oh, really? - It's that damn play. I've committed myself to it and I'm stuck. I really don't want to go. But, listen, I've had an idea, why don't you take some clothes and things and throw them in a suitcase, take the baby by the hand and join me, there in New York, soon as possible. Errol, stop joking. No, I'm not joking at all, I'm deadly serious. I want to launch Beverly's career in New York. You'll be there as a chaperone. I'll take care of everything of course. That's a very generous idea, but... I have to give it some thought. No, no, don't think about it really, Florence. Just do it, come on. Come as soon as you can. It'll be wonderful for Beverly, I mean just think of it. New York? What are you talking about? There are some people who took interest in Bev and they could really move her career along. Yeah, like who? Errol Flynn. What? Yeah, he's been helping her out with her career. She's 15 years old. I mean, Lord knows what's gone on. Oh, nothing's gone on. It's perfectly innocent. - I've been there, I've seen them together. - Flo. Flo, Flo. Errol Flynn is a walking penis. - Oh, no that's not... - He can't keep his hands off of young girls. - Okay, so he's interested in her talent? - Yes. Oh, wake up, woman. She's a chorus girl, she's a so-so singer and she's... - She can't act her way out of a paper bag. - You know, you don't know anything. I know. I'm not letting you take Beverly to New York, to be served on a platter to a man like Errol Flynn. Listen, Beverly's whole life has been about one thing and one thing only, and that's show business. You don't understand the difference that just a little helping hand from a director or a producer or a big star like Errol can make. It makes the difference between those who make it, who really make it and those that are left behind on the garbage heap, the has-beens, the wannabes. This is her shot, you can't say no. If you do, she's gonna resent you for the rest of her life, and I will, too. You owe me this. Oh, Flo. You always had your way with that girl. You kept me out... I never kept you out of it, you weren't in it because... Let me finish! Damn you! Take her if you want. But that's it. I'll wash my hands of the both of you. You're on your own. Oh, look, Bev. I've always wanted to come to New York. You know, not many mothers would do what I'm doing. I know. I love you, Mom. Oh, I love you too, baby. Mom. Errol wanted me to talk to you about the sleeping arrangements. Okay. He wanted me to tell you that I'd be sleeping in his room most nights. - What? - It's the way he wants it. That may be the way he wants it, but that doesn't mean that's what he's going to get. Mom, come on. He's Errol Flynn. - You better not say anything. - Don't tell me what to do. I trusted you. - Mom, don't embarrass me. - Just stop whining. - Yes. - Yes, we are here to see Mr. Errol Flynn. It was leaving for Hong Kong. So, we got on it... - Hi, how are you? - Good. Woodsey. - Everyone, may I have your attention. - May I take your coat? I wish to present the marvelous Mrs. Florence Aadland and her exquisite daughter, Beverly. It's their first time in New York. - So I hope you give them a warm welcome. - Welcome. - Hello, Beverly. - Hello. - Oh, God, I missed you. - I missed you. - Thank God you're here. - I'll put these in the closet, ma'am. - Hey, there, I'm John Ireland. - The actor? Yes, indeed. Your daughter's very lovely. Yes, thank you. Hello, Florence. I know. I know you're angry with me and you have every reason to be. - I am the devil incarnate. - I could have you thrown in jail. - Please, don't joke about this. - I'm not joking. You lied to me. You blatantly lied to me, to my face about what you were up to with my baby. I thought it was perfectly obvious. What did you want me to say? That I was in over my head with your daughter? Your beautiful clever daughter. Whom you've groomed so carefully - to seem older than her years? - Oh, now, I'm the one to blame? No. No. No. No more than I am. But, if I deceived you you deceive me as well, not to mention the rest of Hollywood. Florence. I love Beverly as much as I've ever loved anyone. And for some reason she loves me, really loves me. So, please, try to find it in your heart to forgive me for both our sakes. And I think if you'll admit it, you always knew what was going on, didn't you? All right, what are you love birds doing in here? - I'm sorry. - No, no, we're just, catching up. Right, Flo? So here we are. Enough for everyone. Seeing them together again I realized that it was a love match. I saw that he genuinely cared for her, very much, but as I turned it over and over in my mind I realized it could go either way. The liaison with Errol could be very good for Beverly's career, but it could also be a disaster. They weren't married after all, and if the press realized what was going on, it would be a page one scandal. I knew we were playing with dynamite here and it all had to be handled very carefully. I didn't want our lives turning from an A picture into a B movie. Look darling, Dag Hammarskjld, he's a great man. - You know who he is? - Yes. Who is he? He works at the United Nations, he's like a secretary. - Yes, secretary-general to be precise. - Yeah. I am going to get you a tutor while you're here. - No, tutors are boring. - Well... I like things just the way they are. Well, I'm gonna get you some decent books to read at any rate. Something with a little more literary merit than the funnies. Oh, no, come on, don't spoil it. It's the most fun I've ever had. Really, you don't miss Los Angeles, your friends? No. I'm like a windup toy there. Go to this audition, go to this dance class, go to this voice coach... - Do you even like show business? - Yes. - Really? - Kind of. It's fun. There sure are a lot of swelled heads around though. You might say that. What I really want is to just be with you, and do fun things and go out and stay in. And just be free for once in my life. You examine me, Miss Eyre. - You think me handsome? - No, sir. By my word, there is something singular about you. When one asks you a question you... you... You rap out a round rejoinder, which if not blunt, is at least brusque. Sir, I beg your pardon, I spoke too plain. I ought to have replied that beauty is of little consequence, or something of the sort. You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little consequence, indeed. Indeed. Indeed. And so, under the pretense of softening, your previous outrage now, you stick a penknife under my ear. What fault do you find with me, pray? I can't believe it. - Who does this clown think he is? - I told you not to read that. They never ever a kind word, if they did, they probably misspell it. Goes after the actress, too. You should have used Bev. Well, I had a really disastrous day myself. I'm sorry, what happened? I got a letter from Bev's father asking me for a divorce. - And he's not giving us a penny. - Oh, that's terrible. - I'm so sorry. - Yeah. You know, I was mad for that man. I met him when he was the bartender at the Roosevelt Hotel. I was a waitress working for tips and going up for auditions whenever I could. - You were an actress? - No, I was a dancer. And not half bad, actually. I got a callback for a Fred and Ginger movie. - Really? - Yes. One night after work we were going up Highway 1, to this little beach that we liked and, oh, we'd been drinking, and Herb took a turn too quickly and the next thing I knew, I was in the hospital and the doctor was telling me that he'd taken off my leg. Poor thing. That's awful. But when Bev was born, she was such a special child, and I felt as if she had been given to me to make up for my leg. - Of course. - It was as if it had been pre-ordained. Everything that has gone on has felt as if it was... pre-ordained. You've done a marvelous job raising Woodsey. No, no, you are a superb mother. - Thank you. I tried. - Yeah. My own mother was a class A cunt. - Errol. Oh. - Oh, no, no. She did despicable things to me and to my father. Destructive woman. Yeah, I'm sure Mr. Freud would say that she had a large hand in shaping my distinctive attitude toward women. But you're a gentleman among gentlemen. Florence, I am and always will be, quite literally, an absolute son of a bitch. - Cheers. - And you know it. Cheers. - To hell of a day. - To hell of a day. - So, what happened next? - Well, then after the play closed, Errol's luck changed and he got a call from the top director, John Huston, who asked him to be in his new film, The Roots of Heaven and that starred Juliette Grco and Orson Welles. The only bad thing was that it was in Africa. Woodsey, it's incredible to me that love would exist between a man my age and one so young. But I do so want to believe that you mean what you've been writing to me. It might seem unbelievable that a man as masculine as Errol would weep while writing a love letter, but there's no doubt that he did. Beverly loved those letters, they were the only thing that kept her going with him away. But afterwards, she just missed him more. And then something happened that took us both by surprise, Errol landed a part for Bev in the film, but it turned out, that old fox had a trick up his sleeve. - I'm sorry, no. - Mom, come on. It will be a cold day in hell before I let you go that far without me. It's not my fault that he could only get them to pay for one ticket. Yeah, I'm sure he tried very hard. - Please, please, please... - Baby, just stop it. Just stop it. This isn't a day trip to the Santa Monica Pier that we're talking about here. But I would be with Errol, you know he'd look after everything... There are bugs and animals and diseases and God knows what else. Well, fine. I'll just go, you can't stop me. You just try it, missy, and you see how far you get. Mom, it's a big movie with major stars. I have to say I'm really amazed you'd want me to pass up an opportunity like this, it goes against everything you've ever taught me. Unless you don't think I'm up to it. That's ridiculous. So she went to Africa, all that way, and she would write me these wonderful little postcards saying how hot it was. All of the cast and crew came down with dysentery except for Errol, who was avoiding drinking water. I stayed on in New York and picked up a job in a nearby movie theater. The pay wasn't bad and the people were all right. One week they were playing Errol's movie and I really got a hoot out of telling folks all about him. In the end I decided to go home to California and wait for Beverly. And when she came back we clicked into our routine just like she'd never been away. - That's Katonga. - Katonga, okay. - He was so nice. - Sweet. - Is that a rat? - No, no. That's Riki. - Oh, Riki? - He was my pet mongoose. - Oh, God, looks like so much fun. - It was. I ate so much, the desserts were so good. This was our hotel. And here's us in Madrid. We didn't stay there for very long. - This is the Mediterranean Sea. - Oh, so calm. Yeah, I know. This is on Errol's yacht, the Zaca, in Majorca. - Such a beautiful boat. - So beautiful. I almost forgot, I have a little, welcome home... Just a little something for you. Thank you. That's so sweet. It's a Paula Lynn. Oh, that's nice thank you, Mom. Of course, if you don't really care for it, you can exchange it. - No. No, I really like it. - My feelings won't be hurt. - It's really pretty. I like it. - Fine. Florence. - Errol. - Drink? Why not, what are we drinking? We're drinking your health, of course. - So nice to see you. - Thank you. I can hardly believe that we actually made it back in one piece from the bowels of darkest Africa. - Here you are. - Thank you. You're younger. - Doesn't Woodsey look well? - Beautiful. Light of my life. Fire of my loins. - You remember where that's from? - That book by Nabokov. You see how I'm educating her. Yes, well... Ladies, if you will excuse me, I'll go slip into something more dignified. Oh, I'm so glad you're back, both of you. Does he seem maybe just a little... - I don't know, off? - He's fine, Mom. But you wouldn't notice because you see him every day, but he seems... - I don't know, something's going on. - He has back pain, that's all. That's what it is. Is he seeing a doctor? - Yes. - Okay. Just drop it. I'm gonna get another box of slides. Woodsey, why are you so dressed all the time? Grab a hat, would you? Flo, pardon. One line, that's it? - I had more, they cut it out. - I don't believe it. - I'm furious with the studio. - Good job, Errol. Yeah, thank you very much, thank you. You know, they always do it, they cut the best scenes. - They cut a lot of my lines, as well. - Can't you do something about it? No, no, no. They're a hard-headed lot. I gave you up for five months and that's it? - I had a great time. - That's not the point, is it? I don't know, Florence, I think perhaps happiness is the point. At the end of the day, more important than stardom and Hollywood. Fame is like a religion in this godless country. It only provides the public with idols that they can worship and then tear down as the mood strikes them. Don't change the subject. She hasn't had a shot, you said you'd give her a shot, she hasn't had one. - How's your health? - Never better. People say you drink too much. If you believed all the rumors about me, I'd think you were... I'd think I was something quite extraordinary. I have to say the idea definitely intrigues me. - Errol Flynn as Humbert Humbert. - Yes, it's the part of a lifetime. I was born to play it really, you know, I think this chap Nabokov is a genius. I love that book. Yes, and I think for the role of Lolita you'll agree that Beverly has all the right prerequisites. - How did her audition for you go? - Not well. Oh, you're not gonna find a better Lolita. - You can search all you want. - No dice, Errol. Besides, she's too old. That's a shame. I think you ought to rethink this, Kubrick, because you see, we're sort of a package deal. You're not serious? Well, that makes things... Awkward. Just when Hollywood closed its doors, Errol had a terrific idea. He'd always been fascinated by the ideology behind rebel causes. So, he flew to Cuba and began work on an independent movie in support of the rebel chief Fidel Castro. This time, it was no bit part for Beverly. Are all you Americans so bloodthirsty? This isn't even your war. I don't even know who those guys Batista and Castro are. That's your problem. But the man I'm gonna marry is out there in that stinking, lousy jungle hiding. And if he has a reason for it, so can I. I wish some of the Cubans felt as strongly as you do. Cut. Wonderful, moving on. - Nice take. - Oh, thanks. - I'm serious. - Goofball. So we got... three hours of sun and five scenes. Here's what I think you should do. You should do... - It's nicer over here in Cuba. - Yeah. Beverly, I know flirting when I see it, and that was flirting. What am I supposed to do, he was talking to me, I was only talking back. While you're here, making this movie with me, you will behave appropriately. - Got it? - What are you, my parent? Don't dare try that with me. Hello. - Here you go, Mr. Flynn. - Thank you, old sport. - Where's Miss Woodsey today? - She's... - Out and about. - She's very young. Yes. I'm far too old for her, but sadly, she's not too young for me. Mr. Flynn, there's a place that's not too far from here, they have plenty girls, and very young and very beautiful. I'm sure they are. Thanks old boy, not today. Excuse me. - Hello. - Hello. You're mad at me? Is there a reason I should be mad at you? No. Then I'm not mad. You surprise me. I surprise even myself sometimes. They are having a ball out there. And Beverly's career is taking off in leaps and bounds. That Errol's a marvel. Errol Flynn. They don't make them like that anymore. Yeah, he's... He's a rascal, that one. He's always playing pranks. I mean, it's just so much fun. To be around him, you know. I miss him. You're burning up. - It's malaria. It's come back. - I think we should get a doctor. No, no. Look, maybe they could give you something. Just hold me. Just hold me. I'm dying, Woodsey. No, you're not. I am. I feel it. - I feel it. - You are not. I am the... most selfish man in the world. Don't be silly. All my life, I've done what the hell I wanted. And to hell with the consequences. I'm dragging you down with me. - What have I done to you? - Errol, stop. This is crazy. Just rest. You'll be okay. You'll be okay. Good morning, Woodsey. Morning. Do me a favor, would you, darling? Bring me that flask. I think you should drink water. Water is just for swimming in, I've told you that. Are you gonna be okay? Yes, I actually think the worst is over. For this round. - You need to rest for a few days. - Yes, ma'am. I want you to get me a clean sheet of paper. I want you to write something down for me. What? - Just do it, would you? - Not until you tell me. Just in case anything happens, I want to make things right with you. To make an amendment to my will, that's all. What are you talking about? You're gonna be fine. Just do it. - There's some notepaper. - Good enough. I, Errol Thomson Flynn, being of sound mind and body... am hereby dictating my last will and testament. When they came back from Cuba, it was time to throw a party. Beverly's 17th birthday was coming up, so Errol splashed out. He hired a band and invited some of his Hollywood crowd. All of Beverly's high school friends turned up. And I think they were amazed to see what a star she had become. Go, Daniel. Darling, that was beautiful. Oh, God. Everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, friends... new friends, old friends, I have a formal announcement I'd like to make concerning our birthday girl. I want the world to take note that Miss Beverly Aadland, a lovely girl, somewhere between the ages of five and 50... will soon become the fourth and final Mrs. Flynn. Happy birthday, happy, happy birthday Happy birthday Happy, darling? We did it, baby. We did it. And I hope that all your dreams come true Happy birthday, happy, happy birthday Happy birthday Happy birthday to you - There you are. Enjoy. - Oh, thank you. Congratulations, Florence. - Oh, Madge, thank you for coming. - Such a swell night. - I had so much fun. - Oh, good. Beverly looks so beautiful. I know, she's gonna make a beautiful bride. You never told me. How did she ever meet Errol in the first place? Well, I think it was fate. You see, she was passing for 18 at the studio, so I couldn't really tag along. Mama couldn't just tag along, you know. So, I wasn't there when they got together. But she told me everything. - Beverly? - Oh, are you leaving? Yes, yeah. She was a virgin and he made love to her on the first night. And he was so crazy for her that he tore her dress. Yes, it was a $75 bolero Paula Lynn. Can you imagine, but, you know, what was she gonna do? - It's Errol Flynn. - My God. Baby! - You remember Madge from the nail salon. - What are you doing? What do you... Oh, it's okay. It's okay. Madge is good people and she's been following your career. - It's private. - Don't you talk to me that way. I'll see you ladies later. Why do you keep telling everyone? It's none of their business. - I know who I can trust and who I can't. - No, you don't. Yes, I do and look, just because you're engaged to Errol, doesn't mean that you own him lock, stock and barrel. He's my friend, too. - He's my fianc, not yours, Mom. - Obviously. So stay out of it. Just how far do you think you would have gotten with this thing if it weren't for me? - What thing? - The thing. You and Errol. Do you know how much I sacrificed so that you two could be together? - How much I've... - It has nothing to do with you. Nothing! - I lost my home, my marriage. My husband... - You did it all for yourself. - I did it for you! - Leave us alone. You come back here! Come back here. You... What? What are you looking at? You too. Mind your own business. You know, Florence, I was wondering. I really wanna interview Beverly. I don't think so. Maybe she could shed some new light on some of the... Beverly doesn't know about the book. And I don't want to involve her in this. Well, I'd handle it very gently. When the time is right, I will tell her. Not before then. Okay. - That's how you feel? - That's how I feel. So, where were we? The final chapter. Errol, he wasn't making the kind of money that he did in his glory days. And in order to settle his divorce, he needed some ready cash. So, even though the Zaca meant the world to him, he went up to Vancouver to sell his yacht. That shows how much he loved Bev. Right there. I'm already getting enquiries. A treasure hunting expedition in the Caribbean, searching for Spanish gold. Errol Flynn at the helm. That's a nice idea, sport, but... need a bit of time to think it over. Okay. Well... - We best be going to the airport. - Fine. I can drive you there myself. - Are you sure, sport? - Are you kidding me? It would be an honor. What's the matter? My back. - Oh, it's killing me. - I can call a doctor. No, no, no. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. Yeah, it's getting better. Yeah. And I've got medicine in my bag. I could use a nice stiff drink though, if you'd be so kind. - It's in my legs. - I have an old friend who's a doctor. - His house is on the way. - No, no, no. I'll be fine, really. We need to take him to the doctor's. - Hello. - Hey, doc. It's George. Are you busy? I have someone with me who needs looking at. - Is it urgent? - I don't know. It might be. And get this, it's Errol Flynn. Okay. Bring him straight away. You're not gonna believe this. - Great to meet you, Errol. - Pleasure, doctor. And this is Beverly Aadland, my small companion. I told Cynthia not to call anyone, but... Shall we go into the den so I can take a look at you? Later, later, old sport. Hello, everyone. You all remember who John Barrymore was? One of the greatest actors of his generation, right? - Of course. - Yeah. Well, he just died. Been a tremendous friend of mine, and of the director, Raoul Walsh's. And well, while I was out drowning my sorrow in vodka, Raoul hightailed it over to the mortuary. And he's told the mortician that Mr. Barrymore's crippled aunt wanted to view the body. He slipped the cat 200 smackers, smuggled the corpus delicti to my very own home, where they deposited him in my favorite armchair. Well, I got back two hours later. I was drunk. Sad drunk. I opened the door, flicked on the lights. And staring right at me, was John Barrymore. His eyes were cold. His expression was... He was bloodless, gray, bloated. I let out a gasp. I ran out the door. I was about to climb into my car and tear down the hill, when I heard voices. There on the porch was Raoul and his cronies, just as pleased as punch. What happened to the body, Errol? Oh, they took it back to the mortuary and no one was the wiser. But if I know Barrymore, he was up on his cloud saying, "Thanks for the outing, boys. That last place was a bit cramped." Is it true you have a two-way mirror put up in your guestroom? I'm sorry, young man. I would never corrupt you with that sordid tale. Oh, it's all right. He can hear it, Errol. To tell you the truth, I need to lie down for just a bit. - Do you need me to... - No, no, no. Stay there, old sport. I never felt better in my life. I shall return. - So, how do you like Vancouver? - Oh, it's beautiful. We really like it. Can I ask how old you are, Beverly? I'm 21. Really? You look younger. I was only 18, when I met Kenneth and we were in high school. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm going to check on Errol. Errol? Errol? Errol? Is it your back, Errol? Errol? Help! Someone help me! Please! Errol? Help! Help me, someone! Help me! Help! Please, help! Errol? Errol! Errol? No. No! Errol, no! But is it true Errol Flynn died in your arms? - What were his last words? - How long had you known him? Are you going to the funeral? Miss Aadland, did Flynn leave you anything in his will? - Beverly! Bev! - Miss Aadland, how did you meet... How old are you? Beverly! Now, it's time for our once-a-week round-up of America's number one society stories. What's the news this week, Hedda? Well, I for one, am fed to the teeth with all the drool about Errol Flynn and the Aadland ladies. It makes me sick. We've known for years what a rou Flynn was. And he met his match in Beverly, a teen hellcat... As for the peg-legged scheming mother, well, Mrs. Aadland, in this state there is a little statute on the books about contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Keep it up and you'll end up right where you belong, in the clink. Bev! Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I missed you so much. Come on. You look tired. Have you been sleeping? I'm fine. I just... just wanted to stay out of the spotlight. I know. It's... It's been very hard. I fixed up the bedroom for you very nicely. And I'll just... I'll stay on the couch. Oh, no, it's okay. I'm fine with the couch. Mom? There's all this crazy stuff in the press about me being pregnant, and the will. It makes me so damned mad. - Have you been talking to them? - No, not really. Well, don't. She's not great. She's only been sleeping about two hours at a time. And she doesn't eat... I didn't know what was wrong. So I took her to the doctor and the doctor said that she's just grief-stricken. - Well, she's been through a lot. - I know, Ronnie. I know. That's why I thought it would be a good idea for her to just... You know, throw herself into something. Like her career. Take advantage of all the attention. In fact, there's a guy out in Glendale who wants her to appear in his nightclub. It's just the ticket for Bev, I think. Some say that happiness Is hard to find Some say they'd never Have peace of mind I say the same thing And I thought it was true But that was before I met you Some say that life Is a mystery Some say that love - Brings only misery - Asshole. I say the same thing And I thought it was true But that was before I met you Hank Segal of the Times loved you. And the Hollywood Post is gonna write a little article. And Pat is so happy because the take at the bar was twice what it normally is. That's 'cause you were here. Very funny. So... What do you say we celebrate and go, maybe, to Canter's and get a burger and a shake? I can't. I'm going to a party at Jack's tonight. I don't like you hanging out with those punks. They are... They just play up to you because you're famous and because of Errol... - That's not true. - You be home by midnight. Beverly? Bev? Wait here. - Yeah, who is it? - I wanna talk to Beverly. - Who is this? - I have to talk to Beverly. If you don't let me talk to her, I'm gonna call the police. - Sleep it off, lady. - Wait a minute. Beverly? Beverly? Beverly! Beverly! Beverly, it's your mother! - She's out of her mind. - She's baying at the moon. - Beverly! - Go home, lady! - What? - Go home! But I want my daughter here! Is she up there? - Beverly? Send her down! - I haven't seen her! Yes, you have! You liar! Get me my daughter! Bev! What? What the fuck are you doing, you jackass? Come down... stop it! What are you doing? Beverly! I'm gonna get the law after you, you stupid punks! Go home! I called as soon as I saw the papers. - When's the court date? - 23rd of next month. - It's hard to believe, really. - I know. Contributing to the delinquency of a minor and then they take Bev and they hold her in juvenile hall, what is the point of that? They're just trying to punish me for what Errol did. - It'll never stand up in court. - Why? It's got a lot of major difficulties. I mean, it's in Beverly's handwriting for a start. And that really wouldn't be such a problem, except for when you look on the back, there's no signature page. - It's gotta be there, somewhere. - No, not on this copy. He dictated it to Beverly, so he must have signed it. I mean, he wanted Beverly to have a third of his estate. Well, his estate is, believe me, a nightmare. I don't really care. You've gotta find the signature page. But Florence, it's more than that. He needed to initial every page in the presence of a witness, two witnesses. This is a sloppy job. Typical. - Are you eating? You look thin. - No, I'm fine. - They taking good care of you? - Yeah, they're really nice. Don't worry, baby. We're gonna be back together again real soon. Mom, people are saying that they're never gonna give you custody. What? Who's saying that? Just people around here. My social worker and stuff. Well, that's not true. I've spent my last dime on a crackerjack attorney and I'm fighting with everything that I've got. I know. But I just wanted to say that if it doesn't go your way, they've talked to me about some foster care at a ranch outside the city. No, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. It's not the way it's meant to be. I don't think that anything was ever meant to be, Mom. I disagree. All right, I don't wanna argue about it. Bev, I... I went to see the lawyer about the will and... It's no good. He doesn't think it's gonna hold up. But, Errol dictated it to me himself in Cuba. I know, I know, I know. But they can't find the signature page. And they don't know if it was stolen or it was misplaced. Then he didn't... He didn't file the damn thing properly. It's just... Left us high and dry. Well, I don't care. I don't care about the money. I don't care about anything, really. There's nothing that can bring him back. I know, baby. It was a party whenever he was around, wasn't it? Now, the party's over and we have to clean up the mess. But, actually, Bev... Something has... come up that might be a silver lining to all of this. There's an offer of a book. It would be about you and me and Errol, and I've been talking to this writer. He seems like a good guy and he says it's a slam dunk. - Mom, don't. - What? Don't do that. Don't talk to him. - Bev, did you love Errol? - Of course. Well, don't you think that you owe to him to tell the real story of your love? I mean, all the gutter versions are out there. Now is our chance to set the record straight, to tell the world what a good man he was and how much he loved you. Bev, you're still so young. When you get to be my age, you realize that life just goes by in a minute. This is our chance to make our mark. All those people that are clucking their tongues at us, they don't have what we have. They don't have our real story. A love story that will stand the test of time. People will know who we are, a hundred years from now. But none of that matters once you're gone. Look at Errol. Look at Errol. He is still here, because he's Robin Hood, the swashbuckler, and people remember. Have you signed anything with him? Not yet. Well, don't. - Promise me that you won't. - Oh, Beverly. Promise me, or you'll never see me again. All right, I promise. Thank you. I love you, Mom. I love you, baby.
