Look at that... you scum! You get awesome chicken on the left here. Don't just pay lip service, Morey. Get it tomorrow. Morey, stop here. Ma'am... Jai Hind, Ma'am. Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir. Jai Hind, Sir. Boss is in a bad mood today. He's pissed with everyone. His wife must've screamt at him Ma'am, his PA was telling me, he forgot to take his wife shopping for their anniversary. She got so upset she cancelled their dinner reservations. We can handle the toughest of criminals easily... ...but when it comes to handling family, we goof up. So true, Ma'am. That's why Morey is taking the day off tomorrow. Oh yes. It's your sister-in-law's wedding on Sunday, right? Yes, Ma'am. How is your younger one studying? Wonder when she studies! She's always glued to the TV or the computer. That reminds me... Hello. - Hello, Meera. - Yes, Aunty. - Done with your revision? - Of course. I can hear the TV. - When are you coming? - Soon. - Have you got it? - What? Yes, Ma'am. I was speaking to Jafar. O kaY- Better get done with your revision till I am back. O Kay; bye' Have you fed them? They are getting a royal treatment. Morey, is feeding them cheese since the afternoon. Who told you mice eat cheese, Morey? I saw it on Tom & Jerry. These guys love cheese. Our surveillance team is already there, right? I'll confirm, Ma'am. Shinde... The baby's crying... oh my God! You son of a... Get up! Bloody rascal! Only a mouse can get another mouse out of his hole. Ma'am, please don't shoot me. Please, Ma'am. We are not going to shoot you. Please, Ma'am... I don't have orders to shoot you, you scum. I have to take you in alive. - Jafar... - Yes, Ma'am. - Send the rest of the unit inside. - Yes, Ma'am. God knows who else is hiding inside for a threesome. Get him! You son of a... You have dodged us four times before. You think we'll let you escape so easily? Ma'am, I am warning you. Ali Bhai will ruin you. Take him away! Giving refuge to rats spreads plague. Rehman, you should be thankful to me. You could at least make love one last time. Jafar was all set to spoil it for you. You are ragging me, aren't you, Ma'am? Sir's call. - Yes, Sir. - You got Rehman? Yes, we are taking him to the station. I had ordered you to get him out and nab him... ...not barge right inside the chawl. You know how sly Rehman is, Sir. If we had let him come out he would definitely have escaped. We would have arrested him again if he escaped. But who would be responsible... ...if a civilian was killed in a shootout? We had taken precautions, Sir. Taking rats along was your precaution? Oh, for God's sake, Shivani! It was a calculated risk, Sir. Your job is to take orders, not risks. You understand? Someone please take Sir's wife for shopping. Go home, Ma'am. Meera has asked you to come early, right? If we don't get this rascal's paperwork right... ...he'll find a loophole to escape from the law. No chance, Ma'am. We'll keep the papers ready by morning. You have a look at it. O kaY- Sorry, I am late again. It's okay. Meera, wake up. Your Aunty is home. sorry... Happy birthday, sweetheart! Aunty! You are so late. Happy birthday, Aunty! For me? No, Aunty. I stood first in the orange belt category. Wow! Did you show it to mom and dad? Yes. Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday dear Shivani... Happy birthday m you. This is for Meera. And for me? Come on... Fast, fast, fast. And this is for you. Wow! It looks great on you, Ma'am. Just like John Abraham (Indian film star). Wear these goggles and ride a bike in style... Hey, hey! If I look like John Abraham, then girls will chase me. Show me something else. Of course, Ma'am. I'll show you something else. I have a lot of variety. Try this one. Chulbul style. Dabang (Indian film). He was a cop just like you. Roam around in style with these. That one Chulbul Pandey is enough. We don't need another. Ma'am, I also have a Sunny Leone style goggle. But that one doesn't have a glass. It's a see through. That's why I am not offering it. But don't worry Ma'am. I know exactly what you are looking for. Hang on a second. I have a lot of variety... What the hell is going on there? Go check Morey. Ignore it, Ma'am. We are from the crime branch. Why do we need to get into it? Morey, we are from the crime branch later. We are cops first. Let's go. Let's go. Ma'am, goggles... How dare they celebrate Valentine's Day! Enough! Enough of this destruction! Ma'am, please don't come in our way. Let us do ourjob. Get lost! Only one of us can do ourjob right now. And right now, I am on duty. So, you stop working and let me work. Don't act smart. Shut up and get lost. You guys keep going! Last warning. You and your bloody last warning! You...! I will screw your happiness! Stan counting, Morey. Section 143 - unlawful assembly. Section 147 - rioting. Section 132 - abetment of mutiny. Section 504 - intentional insult with intent... ...to provoke breach of peace. Section 506 - criminal intimidation. Get up! Two more sections left. Get up! Section 188 - disobedience to order given by public servant. And Section 353 - assault or criminal force... ...to deter public servant from discharge of duty. Anybody else wants a lesson in law? Jafar, did you get record the video? Yes, Ma'am. Make sure your boss gets my name right. Shivani Shivaji Roy. Senior Inspector, Crime Branch, Unit 3. Do whatever the hell you want! Get lost! Aunty, it's only for fifty bucks. - How much? - Aunty, fifty bucks. No, no. Give it for thirty. No, Aunty. Take it for fifty. Okay, let's settle at thirty-five. Okay? O kaY- Pyaari! Pyaari! Come here! Hang on. Aunty, please hurry. Here's a twenty... thirty... Pyaari, come quickly! Coming! Keep the change. Pyaari, get in. How are you? There it is. Read later, Pyaari. Eat first. lam going to treat both of you this Friday. Really? Why? It's my birthday. - Really? - No. I thought I'll celebrate my birthday along with Ganpati's (Hindu God). The whole of India will celebrate it then. Very smart. If the whole of India will celebrate... ...then even we must too, right? Right. I'll get the cake. Which flavour do you like? Kaalakhatta. Aunty, kaalakhatta... No problem. If that's what Miss Pyaari wants. Done. Kaalakhatta cake. How old will you be? - How old are you? - Twelve. Me too. You too? Same pinch. What a stroke of luck it was that I found you! Remember how you were standing at the railway station? If it wouldn't have been for me, your uncle would have sold you off. Aunty, but you met me, right? My Ganpati selected you for me. And me? You, I have selected myself! Shivani, please put these eye drops for me. Just a second. I am on my last set. Again? Hurry up please. I have to go to the clinic. What happened? Your Kaku never lets me work out in peace. Really. Why are there so many boxes of cake in the fridge? There will be one more today. Why? These are Pyaari's birthday cakes. Its been three days, I just can't find her. So a new cake every day? We can't feed her a stale cake on her birthday, can we? Just you wait! I'll pull her ears and get her home today. Very good. Yes, Jafar. I'll handle that. You keep the charge sheet ready. I'll come in some time. Yes, Jafar. Ma'am, I want to meet Pyaari. Who are you? Tell Pyaari, Shivani Aunty is here. Who is Shivani Aunty? Shivani Shivaji Roy. Crime Branch, Senior Inspector. Did you find her? - Who? - Her. Who's her? You just asked for her. Pyaari. Did you find her? Find Pyaari? Where is she? I thought since you are a cop you might have found Pyaari. Who let these kids inside? What's wrong with her? She's missing since the last four days. Usually we wait for two days before we file a missing complaint. These kids wander off sometimes. But they come back in a couple of days. Pyaari didn't come back till last evening... ...so we filed a missing complaint. Where? At the D. N. Nagar Police Station? This is D. N. Nagar... ...so we'll obviously go to D. N. Nagar Police Station, right? When did you see her last? Four days back. I want to meet these kids. Ma'am, please wait. Tambe! She was with us three days ago. And... You fool! We even ate wadapaav. Kids get lost but they also come back. You come after a few days. You'll find her. We played together at bed time. Hide and seek. I haven't seen her after that. I saw her when I came in the morning. Don't know where she disappeared later. She was carrying her bag of books. I even asked her where she was going. But she didn't say anything. She just left. Six months ago even Yashoda Didi disappeared in the same way. One cup of tea Since when do you have your stall here? What's the matter Ma'am? ls anything wrong? Just answer my question. I regularly bribe Mr. Pawar, Ma'am. You won't have to pay, if you work for me. What's the job? You have to keep an eye on this shelter home. Who comes in, who goes out. You want me to be an informer, right? You are very smart, huh? A girl called Pyaari is missing from here. Give me all the information you can get. Clear? Write my number down. 9-8-2... Meera, are you ready? I have made your favourite breakfast today. Sharda Bai, one more cup of tea please. Yes, Sir. Let me comb your hair today. - Sir, tea. - Clear this. You need a good hair-cut. We'll go to a posh salon in Bandra this Sunday... ...and get you a nice haircut. Okay? How can you be so normal, Aunty? Pyaari is missing since five days. And we are behaving as if it never happened. She has been kidnapped. Wonder where Pyaari is now... - Hello, Ma'am. - Hello. There's no network inside. So he comes out to take his calls. Something about dealings... He bought a new cell phone a few days ago. He is obsessed with clicking snaps on his phone. He has clicked mine too. Where would he be right now? Ogling at girls outside Chaaya restaurant. Kapil! What are you up to? Nothing much. I was just heading home. Heading home? I'll drop you. No, Ma'am, don't bother. It's no bother. Come, sit. Come. Come sit. Half our life is spent waiting in this Mumbai traffic. Whose call is it? Answer it. It's from home. lam going home anyway. Your family is missing you, huh? Well... my wife gets worried if I don't reach home on time. Anyway... May I take a snap with you, Sir? Yes, of course. Take a good one. Done? Show me. What a phone you have there! Ma'am, take a look. Latest mobile. WOW! Jafar, what did you earn in so many years with the police force? Peanuts! We should also quit our jobs and join an NGO. Pick little girls from the shelter home... ...sell them and buy expensive cell phones. Get home on time and enjoy life. Right, Kapil? Don't play dumb. We know. Jafar, let's start his interrogation here itself. If we wait for the traffic to move Kapil won't get home on time. Good idea, Ma'am. Speak up. Who do you work for? I don't understand what you are talking about, Sir. Why are you stretching it? We are in an 'instant' era. The quicker you answer, the quicker you get home. Come on speak up. On whose instructions did you kidnap Pyaari? Where is she? Speak up, you scum! He's just pretending. You are messing with my head now! Are you done? - He's been shot, Ma'am! - What?! There they are! Morey, call the control room and get reinforcement. - Quick! - Okay, Ma'am. Morey keep his mobile. Move aside! Move! The other shooter. Jafar, this matter is getting complicated. Damn! Pyaari, where are you my child! Come here. Move. Stop fooling around, guys! Come on. - Go there. Who's next? - She. What's the matter, baby? Having fun, aren't you? Will you rip it or should I? - Come on. - No, please no! Come here. No! Get her. Come on. Stand straight, you! lam telling you for the last time. Don't do this to me. Please! Easy, Matt u! Take it off! Take a good look. She's a virgin! In spite of you around? Don't you find anyone else to pick on! Put her in No. 2. Baby Doll! Come here to Papa. Come. Hey! Don't come near me rascals. Don't come. Are you insane?! Who will you kill with that splinter? Myself. I will slash myself. Don't slash your wrists. It'll hurt more and will take more time. Loretta School, Kolkata, huh? Her school is very famous. I was in Hindu College. Dropped out in the second year. But that I can help you with. No really. If you really want to die then cut this vein of your neck. It'll be quick and it'll be painless. And if you still want to run I really suggest you drop that idea. Because you have seen me. What's her name? Mrunal. Mrunal, now it leaves us with two options. You either work for me... Don't come, don't come. Chill. It's okay. Or I will have to kill you. What were you about to do? Yeah. I would have also done the same. Slash your wrist slightly from here. It would have taken 5-7 days for you to die. In front of all the girls. ls that what you want? But what to do? A bit of drama is required to control so many of you. And that leaves us with our last option. If you want to stay alive... ...and lead a good life I can help you with that too. You are quite hot, you know. I can get you the best clients. 5 star hotels, fine dining, beaches, clubs, foreign trips. Think about it. But the way I look at it, you don't really have a choice. Do you? Mattu, keep her for Hong Kong. Come on, Charlie's Angel. Put her in No. 1 The shooter has been identified. He's Hanif Hatela's man. - Hanif, the hired assassin? - Yes, Ma'am. You are quite hot, you know. We found a treasure in Kapil's phone. All the notorious ones together? Ma'am most of them are members of the Ali Gang. This one is Balu Kotian... ...and this one is Dhapna Khalid. Go back. Just a moment. This... Who's this? I have never seen him before. Kapil loved to flaunt his connections. He's surely a member of some gang. This is definitely a huge syndicate. To pick up a girl so smoothly, and then shoot him... Only an organized gang can operate with such finesse. There is one man, who keeps track of such things. ls this a new style of interrogation? Feed meat and extract information? Tell me, Rehman, is anything free in life? If everything was without a price... ...then would you have become a gangster? You are right. Do you know him? Are you kidding me? You want me to be an informer at my stature? You idiot! When I had come to arrest you... ...you were begging me not to shoot you. And now you talk about stature? Don't waste my time. I have loads of other work. Katyal. He is Sunny Katyal. He's not from Mumbai. He started operating here around three years ago. He has fifteen car showrooms now. But the real dough comes from drugs and trafficking. Whenever a girl between 8 to 18 years disappears... more often than not he is involved. You can call him the wholesaler of trafficking. No matter where a girl disappears from, she ends up in his net. Why is he not on our radar yet? Your radar? He is not even on our radar yet. It's impossible to crack how he smuggles drugs and girls. How do the other gangs let him operate? He is a very smart man. Keeps everyone happy. Has no enemies. But I have a strong doubt that he is not the brain behind all this. There is someone bigger supporting him. You gave me a lot of information in return for a Mutton Kolhapuri. I did it for the girl. Not for the food. Thanks for the meat. Katyal. Sunny Katyal. I want to know about every message... ...every call that's made from his cell phone. What time he wakes up in the morning to who he bangs in the night! I want to know everything. Got it? Yes, Ma'am. - Check the angle of the video. - Yes, Sir. I want it clear. Hello, Vakil Sir. It's a mess here. The crime branch people have made my life hell. I think they'll very soon monitor me in the loo! How did they get to know about you? How do I know that Vakil Sir? I just know that they are behind my life with a vengeance. What will you do now? lam thinking of talking to the commissioner. Moron! Why inform the commissioner about things that he doesn't know yet! Then please tell me what I should do. Find out the price of the inspector who's leading this operation. Throw some money at him. That's the problem, Vakil Sir. It's some woman. She has a track record of not accepting bribes. Woman? Tell me her name. Shivani Shivaji Roy. From the crime branch. Do one thing. Get me her number. I'll call her tomorrow. Get me the number! Like it's a piece of cake. Where the hell am I sitting! Just when some money was on its way... ...this moron has made plans to ruin it. I have a feeling this inspector is going to ask for a huge price. Has Mr. Singh's payment come? Yes. The batch of girls this time is superb. Really? What did he say? He signed a 200,000 deal. The foreigners loved the service that our girls gave. What is the status of the girls from Bangladesh? It's getting delayed. The security at the border has become very stringent. It will take a week more. You are very lenient with them, Vakil Sir. They are very prompt at collecting their payments. But when it comes to delivery, a week's delay? Not done. What was her name? Shivani Roy. Wow! She's hot. Let it be, Vakil sir. You are too old to deal with women like her. I'll talk to her. Tell Katyal to get all information on her. A week has passed and no leads yet. Either he is smart or our information is wrong. Yeah, Mr. Sinha (Boss) too is getting impatient. Let's wait for a few more days. lam sure he will commit some mistake. Come on. I have got dinner. Hello? You reached home, Ma'am? Who's this? Doesn't matter. How come you picked dinner from Aaswaad tonight? Sharda bai didn't come to work today? Yes. Aaswaad has lovely food. - Want to join us for dinner? - I had heard right about you. Aunty, what have you got? Someone else would have been rattled. Set the plates. lam very hungry. Call Kaku. Go, quick, quick. Tell me. Why are you watching me? If you keep a watch on my men then I will have to watch you, right? Oh! So you are Katyal's daddy! You sound like his son though. How does it matter? It's the same family. The whole family seems twisted. You are calling me from VOIP so I can't trace your call? To deal with a sharp officer like you... ...one needs to be prepared, right? No point tracing the IP address... You won't find anything. Enough bragging- Get to the point. My food is getting cold. Stop watching my people and quote your price. I want my daughter back. Daughter? You have a daughter? The girl you picked up from the Andheri shelter home... ...is like my daughter. Oh! That's why you are behind my life. It might have been possible if you had asked earlier. It's difficult now. Fine. Then the surveillance will continue. You are stretching this a bit too much. She was like your daughter, but not your real daughter, right? Let's do one thing. There's a 35 story skyscraper coming up in Wadala. The top floor is yours. No thanks. If the elevator breaks down, who'll climb 35 floors! Then tell me what you want. I told you I want Pyaari back. Shivani ji, you aren't listening to me. That girl has seen too much. I don't take such a risk in my business. It's too late now. Aunty, hurry UP! Listen, kid. I'll come hunting to your house to rescue Pyaari. But rescue I will. That's a lot of anger Ma'am. Chill. Don't get worked up. It doesn't suit you. Anything else? Don't do this. Think about it please. You need to think about it Junior. I won't take too long to reach Pyaari... ...but the day I reach her you won't be capable of even thinking. Okay, Ma'am. You do your job and I'll do mine. Let's just both do what's best for business. But I have to admit it was fun talking to you. Bye Ma'am. Hello. Mattu, put that girl Pyaari in tonight's lot. Jafar, pick Katyal from his house. I'll finish dinner and come. Yes, right now. How dare you touch me? You can't harass a responsible and innocent citizen this way. Please, please, Sir, speak in Hindi. I do not understand. I will speak to the Human Rights Organisations... ...and feed you to the dogs. Sure. - Jaiar? - Pam? You feed us to the dogs and we will feed you jalebis. Jalebi? You will eat the jalebis, feel Very sleepy but we won't let you sleep. I don't eat jalebis. Shut up and eat! Or I'll... Eat it. He hits very hard. Eat it. I will eat it. Hang on a second. Eat. Gentlemen, please key in your bids on your iPad screens now. For the sweet and spicy No. 104. She looks grown but is just a child. 100% virgin. 100% pure. Guaranteed. No! I thought I'll celebrate my birthday with Ganpati. The whole of India will celebrate it then. How are you? - How old will you be? - How old are you? - Twelve. - Me too. You too? Pyaari, come quickly. You met me, right, Aunty? My Ganpati selected you for me. What will you become when you grow up? An airplane driver. What? It's called a pilot, not a driver, you fool! Same thing. I'll fly the plane very high, right in the middle of clouds. Ma'am, have your ginger tea and fix your mood. Thank you, Jafar. He's a seasoned player. We stuffed him with a kilo ofjalebis... ...didn't give him even a drop of water... ...but he still didn't open his mouth. Ma'am I'll continue for the next four hours. You go on home. Ask Morey and Pawaskar to continue later. Don't let him sleep even for a second. Yes, Ma'am. Thank you. lam coming. Two minutes. Aunty, you are so late! Sorry. But I think we'll soon find Pyaari. Really, Aunty? You are the best, Aunty. You are the best. It won't hurt after a couple of times. Here... ...cupcake. For both of you. Every girl gets it after her first night. Have it. I too blew my past away after my first night. That's the only way to survive here. Otherwise your life will be hell. Come on, now blow the candle and move on. Come on. It's a great idea to teach that nosy cop a lesson. But we'll have to pay a fat price for it. This guy will do our job for free. Here. Call Riyaz. Tell him that this job must be done. Performance bonus guaranteed. Shivani ji, you will stop nosing around after this. Sometimes... I feel scared of you. It's good that way. Fear gets work done faster. Morey... 21 missed calls! Ma'am, come quickly. Why? Ma'am, come quickly please. Get the pervert doctor! In a shocking incident in Mumbai... ...a female patient accused a doctor... ...of inappropriate behaviour. Runa, that's my Kaku! What's going on? A few hours after the allegations... ...the members of Maharashtra Seva Mandal... mattacked the dispensary and defamed the doctor. We had no intentions of taking the law in our hands. But the people are fuming with anger... ...because of the growing exploitation of women. The anger found its vent this way. That doctor must be punished. Please eat. Hello? It's the 'kid' speaking, Ma'am. lam genuinely sorry for what's happened. In fact I even had tears when I heard the news. But I hope this doesn't change things between us. Because I am just starting to like you. There was nothing personal about this, Ma'am. It's just business. Please don't harbour any misunderstanding. Please. You know what, Junior, I grew up in a village. There was a dense forest near my house. That's why from early on in life I knew animals very well. Maybe that's the reason why Kamat Sir took me in the crime branch. To trap a mouse you have to act like one. To catch a dog you have to think like one. To hunt a tiger you have to become one. You know what you are? You are that poisonous snake near the river... ...who can't be seen but bites oblivious kids swimming in the river. You should have been with the Discovery Channel, Ma'am. What are you doing in the police force? You are the one who's about to be discovered, kid. I don't know what your name is. I don't know where you are speaking from. Who your boss is or where you have kept Pyaari. But I've figured your type No matter how far you try to stay away... ...your nature will compel you to come closer to me. 30 days. I will hunt you down in 30 days. And then with a lot of love and patience I'll squish you to pulp. Mark my words. 30 days. Tandon Sir, I have heard there's a high command meeting next week. You hear everything, Mattu. But you do nothing. Sir, first you don't give me an opportunity to work... ...and then you call me useless. This is unfair, Sir. Big announcements are to be made in the party meeting this time. Now you are making me drool. Mr. Taneja is coming this time. Really? That means it's going to be huge. That's awesome, Sir. The contract for Taneja's personal party must come to us. Why should I get you the contract? Name the drug and you'll get it, Sir. Indian, South American. And as far as girls go, look at the choice, Sir. Film star or porn star. You are still not getting me, Mattu. Why should I get you the contract? Oh! I have been blabbering like a fool. The list will obviously begin with you, Sir. And shame on me if you have to tell me your list. Hey, Jennifer! Come here, baby. Come here. Take Sir... Oh! Good choice, Sir. Hey, Julia Roberts! Darling, baby, come here. Don't be shy. Come here. Good girl. Keep the tray here and take Sir to the washroom. Call me on Monday. Maybe this time you'll get lucky. Don't forget, Sir! Come, baby... Hey, Mattu. You really do appear out of nowhere! I have been watching you. How long does it take to crack a deal? lam not selling water purifiers. lam trying to crack a deal worth crores. It takes time. If he doesn't call on Monday... I swear I'll go to Katra and sell religious CDs. If this deal doesn't come through... I won't even leave you capable of selling porn CDs at Palika. I am at it. Please don't threaten unnecessarily. Okay. You crack this deal. I'll send you to Mumbai to look after our set up there. Mumbai? But Katyal is looking after Mumbai, right? Left... left... Very good. Good Job. You fool! Be careful. The packet will break. Be careful. Guggu, will the car be fixed by evening? Yes, Sir. It'll be ready. Hello, Vakil Sir. This time the consignment is superb! Forget the consignment. Listen to me. That cop chick has lost it. She will pick you up again. Vakil Sir, she is after my life! Should I fix her? Don't be stupid, Katyal. You want the entire Mumbai Police force to come behind you? What should I do then? Go underground for a few days. One of my men will come in the evening. Go with him to the safe house. He will make arrangements for you there. What nonsense is this, Vakil Sir? Don't crib so much! Pack your bag and be ready in the evening. Go with my man. Bye. Pour it in my mouth! Get lost! lam surrounded by duck heads! What's going on? Vakil Sir has sent such an atrocious car! Good bye, Sir! Hello? Hello? The network conks off at the slightest disturbance. Nobody cheats the people more than these cell phone companies. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me, Sir? Hello? What's wrong? Why did you stop the car? Everything is bloody jinxed! Get out of the car. Get out. Vakil Sir! Get out of the car or I'll shoot you. lam getting out! Listen to me. Why are you doing this? For money? I'll give you double. Move! Listen to me once. I'll give you all the money you want right away. Your life will be made. What's happening with me! Isn't there a chance? Vakil, what a way to repay my loyalty! Let me tell you one thing before I die. Don't ever be overtly loyal to anybody in life. It screws you. Look at me. Fifteen years... The Hanif you hired to kill Kapil... ...eventually took the contract to kill you. What a business you guys run! May I ask you something? How did you know about this? lam beginning to know your boss a little bit. He knew that if he didn't pick you up I would have. You would always remain a risk to him even if he saved you. When you sat in the car, Morey recognized that your driver was Hanif's man. Hanif has a brick factory here in Kharegaon. It makes it easier to dispose bodies. True. I won't leave that rascal. Nor will I. So tell me. Where does the kid stay? Kid? Which kid? Your boss. He sounds like a kid on the phone. What are you saying, Ma'am. Vakil is at least 50 - 55 years old. He is not a kid. You scum! If you waste our time again... ...I'll make you a eunuch and sell you off. I swear by God I am not lying. If I am lying... ...then do whatever you want to do with me. Vakil got me to Mumbai four years ago. lam working with him since then. Keep talking. I know Vakil very well. He stays in Delhi. Hello? Damn! Katyal escaped. H ow? Hanif's man was found dead. How did he die? He was shot. Where? Tell me, where was Hanif shot? On the body. Where on the body? Front? Behind? Where? He was shot in the head from behind. Where did they find the dead body? Near Kharegaon in a brick factory. Hang up the other phone. Hung UP- Someone saved Katyal exactly where he was supposed to be killed. But who saved him? Who else? Shivani Shivaji Roy. It's time to send her another gift. Congrats Ma'am. Someone has dared to point a finger at me for the first time. Every time you point a finger at me... ...you will get this gift from me. Your Kid. Hunt this guy down. No matter what. Hello! I have left from the hotel. lam going to office now. Be calm. You are the most dangerous when you are calm. Me and Sinha go back a long way. He was my senior in the institute. We used to have fun times those days. He praises you very highly. He is my teacher and guide otherwise I behave like awild bull. You know what. Good officers like you... - May I? -Yes, come in. - Sir... - Take a seat. Meet Sub-Inspector Balvinder Singh Sodhi. A very efficient officer. Shivani Roy. - Ma'am... - Senior Inspector, Mumbai Crime Branch. She has come with information on a huge child... ...and drug trafficking syndicate in Delhi. You guys have my full support to go the whole yard on this, okay? Thank you, Sir. - Where are we going? - To meet my source. Your source? Here? I have got him here with Sinha Sir's help. - Mind if we take my motorcycle? - Sure. Ditto! This is exactly how he looks. The same curls, light eyes. He is the one. The whole world knows him as Vakil. But nobody knows his real name. He sometimes deals as Devinder Pasricha. Or opens an office in the name of Aakash Pandey. But he keeps no name or office for more than six months. We haven't heard of him ever. He takes pride in that. He always boasts that he will never get arrested. Isn't there a way of reaching him? Of course there is. One is drugs and the other is girls. And that too because he is getting senile with age. We can't go posing as customers for girls. He will be expecting me to do something like this. We'll have to play him in such away... ...that lures him to us instead of us approaching him. Usually drug suppliers deal only in one kind of drug... ...but he deals in all kinds of drugs. If he has his way he'll sell cough syrup as drugs. He is that greedy. As far as I know, Sodhi... ...South American drug is hard to get, right? Right. And even if you get it, its very expensive. That means a higher profit margin. He will do anything for business. If we can get this news to Vakil that we are not buyers... ...but suppliers of such high-end cocaine, he's bound to approach us. Bob. There's a guy called Bob. If he comes to know then it is sure to reach Vakil. But our drug supplier should look genuine. Why should we do it? Because it's a question of somebody's life Mbangwa. But it's a matter of our life too. And what if we get killed? Who will kill you? We are here to protect you. Relax. Stupid policeman. No. Listen to me Mboso. Don't forget you don't have any passport. So either I will make papers to deport you back... ...or I will arrange for your stay in Tihar Jail. You decide. - Where's Bob? - What? - Where Bob? Bob? - Bob? Down there. O kaY- Hail Almighty! Mindblowing stuff! Very good, very good. ' Hey. Bob! - Baby! - Having fun? - Yeah! Go enjoy! So, big guy, how much do you have? Five. Five what? Five kilos. Are you crazy? I want 100 grams only. Hey listen. It's either full or nothing. Let's go. Listen, come here. I will tell you one thing. I have one customer who will take it all. The whole material. Okay? How much longer? Please hurry. What should I tell Bob? Who's Bob? Our Bob. Bobby Kukreja. He met those Nigerians. - How much is he demanding? - 50 lakhs. Give me some onions. The material will be good if Bob has checked it. Besides the cricket season is beginning from next month. How much longer? It's been a long time now. Tell all our people that if someone demands girls... ...especially young girls, then don't entertain. Our cop chick will surely send someone as a customer. Not to take any new customers? I said no. This is the limit now! How much longer? Taste from my plate if you are in such a rush. What else to say! Call the Nigerian. But in our manner. Yeah, Bob. The call has come. I am leaving. O kaY- Mathur, I'll wait at Babur Road. Tell me the position of Mboso's car later. Let's go. - Auto! - Lajpat Nagar, please. Ma'am, what are you doing? We called for it first. Shut up! Or I'll call the police. Ma'am we are the police. We are going to raid a place. Want to come along? Ma'am, let's go. Sit. Quick. I am leaving. Have patience. Let me take my bag. The cops are riding autos these days. - Please hurry. - Auto! - Tell Sodhi Mboso's location. - Right away Ma'am. We have got a biker who's asking us to follow. Follow him. Sodhi, a biker is guiding Mboso. Be alert. Sod h I, stop. Stop following Mboso. They are watching. Come, Sodhi. They have left. - Mathur... - Yes, Ma'am. Track the car on GPS and let me know. - Okay? - Right, Ma'am. Go. Yes, Math u r. Sodhi, take a left. Vakil sir, is everything fine? Should I come up? All okay. You can come up. O kaY- Sodhi, Stop. That's Mboso's car. The cops are here. Get out from the back door. Sodhi, there'll be a back door. Cover from there. Bloody swine! You got the cops! Ratan, they'll come up if they hear a gun shot. You leave from the back door. Vakil Sir, leave! The cops have surrounded us. You've deceived Vakil! Leave, Vakil Sir. Hurry! The police is here. Leave from the back door. Hurry! Ratan, you escape from the roof. - What about you? - Don't worry about me. O kaY- Break it. Yes, Vakil Sir? Are you out of there? Come, you... You conned us! In the Nehru Place office... ...there's a black diary beneath my chair. It has the numbers and addresses of our clients. Keep that carefully. I don't have time. If they arrest me they'll reach you. And I won't ever let that happen. What are you talking about, Vakil Sir? We'll get you out somehow. You just leave now. Okay, Tiger. I got to go. Bye. Hello? Vakil Sir? Vakil Sir? Move, move. Sod h i. Damn! You piece of trash! - Hello? - Good morning, Ma'am. Did you sleep well? You are up so early? Do you work in a call centre? What to do Ma'am! I couldn't sleep wondering how to kill you. So have you decided how you'll kill me? I won't kill you. You will kill yourself. lam just going to lie back and watch you. Wow! That's some style you got kid! Are you done wishing good morning... ...or is there anything else you want to say? What is there to say? Now, I will show you what I can do. You are sharp I must admit. You killed Vakil Sir... ...hid your family safely. But now you can't harm me anymore. Because I am still alive. And I am comfortably sitting in my own house. But you are in my territory. Beware. Don't chew. Swallow! Hey, Bengalan! Don't you want to go to London? You just have to eat this pellet. Even the grapes are here. Will you practice with grapes? - I won't. - What do you mean, I won't? You better! Open your mouth. Give me some other work. Enough of your nonsense. Eat or I'll slap you! Mattu is here. Open your mouth and swallow it. - Stop your drama. - Why don't you ask her to swallow? She got Ratan and Sunny arrested. Rest of our men are hiding, right? Yes, they are. You worry too much. By the way when are you sending me to Mumbai? I'll take care of our set up there. Forget Mumbai. What's the report here? 6 girls are leaving for London and 3 for Texas. Their domestic help visas and documents are ready. Last time on the way to the airport... ...a pellet burst in one girl's stomach. Remember? ls anyone else going to die this time? No. This time Alka has taken all precautions. - Right, Alka? - Yes, Sir. This time I have used the safest coatings. The pellets won't burst. Chill. Everything is under control. Yes. Keep the No. 1 and 2 categories. Get rid of the rest. We must have only the best in the party. - Alka. - Yes. Have you sent our man to the police headquarters? Yes. He's been waiting since the morning. She will definitely go there. You don't worry. Dinesh will handle her. That girl with dengue... do something about her. Angelina, baby... ...what's wrong with you? - Nothing... - Nothing! She hasn't slept well last night. ls your name Julia or Angelina? Julia... Then let me talk to Angelina. Look at your condition. Why don't you do something about it? I am just tired... Tired, huh? That's why you have this strip of cloth on your forehead. I understand. Come on. I'll take you to the doctor. Dr. Brad Pitter for Angelina. No, no, no... Let it be, Mattu. I'll take care of her. Let her go. No, Alka. The doctor is waiting. Hurry. Please let her stay. Please. - Come on. - I am alright. - Alka! - Coming. Come... No! Please let her stay. Please. - Hurry. -Yes. Runa... Runa... Get her quickly! Runa... No! Runa! Take her away. Come on! Runa! Please don't take her. Please stop! Shivani, don't stretch this case too much. We have got the man we were looking for. But we didn't, Sir! The mastermind of this syndicate is still roaming free! This is what you think, Shivani. We don't know that for sure. I know that for sure, Sir. I have spoken to him myself. And not just drugs... ...but he also is the kingpin of sex trafficking. Shivani, trafficking is altogether a different matter. We have a trafficking department to investigate that. Department? There's a department to lodge an FIR in every police station, Sir. In spite of that why is just one out of every twenty complaint registered? Sir, you don't need the law to do something. You need intent. And you are determined to find that girl all by yourself, right? She has a name too. Pyaari. All these girls who need our help just end up being 'that girl'. No name, no ties. It's very easy to give up on them. You know what, Shivani. You are being unnecessarily emotional. So one should get emotional only after girls are raped? What's the point of holding a candle march after every-thing's over? After all these days, I don't know what state I'll find Pyaari in. I don't even know if I'll ever find her. Or if she'll be alive. But that doesn't mean that... ...l forget about all these girls like the rest of us. And that too after being a police officer. You know what, Sir... The day our police force gets emotional and works for these girls, ...nobody will dare to harm them. Enough, Shivani! I agree that we have arrested a drug dealer... ...and drugs worth lakhs because of you. But now allow us to take over from here. ls that clear? Sir, why us all the time? Shivani, please don't worry. We'll take care of it. I will see you soon in Mumbai. Thank you, Sir. - Since when do you drive an auto? - What, Ma'am? I asked since when do you drive an auto. Past four or five years. - Can you see that guy there? - Where? - There, the white building. - Where Ma'am? She escaped! Hello? Hello, I wanted to discuss an idea. About what, Miss Shivani? The case is shut. - Hear me out. - Okay. We share the smallest details of our life... ...with our girlfriend boyfriend or spouse, right? Yes, it's a natural human tendency. Correct! So Vakil will also have someone like this. Nobody came to claim his body. Because of fear of interrogation. Tell me what's your point. Vakil must surely have someone. Maybe not a wife. But someone. She will surely know whom Vakil worked for. It seems possible. But how will we find her? Whatever you found on Vakil's body... ...gun, pant, shin, wallet, anything. Get everything. We'll definitely find a clue. But Miss Shivani this is evidence. How can get it out of office? Sodhi, you said you would help. You will get me in trouble Miss Shivani. I was so worried getting these things out of office. Honestly whatever we are doing is illegal. Always by the book. How will you arrest criminals if you keep working by the law? On a serious note, Ma'am, I can't get involved in this any further. I understand. But what if we find something? Please, Ma'am. Okay, okay. We'll cross the bridge when we get there. What bridge? There's nothing here! Modern Tailors, Chandani Chowk. That's surprising. In an era of readymade, this guy wore stitched clothes! Classic old school. Someone who stitches his trousers and shirt form the same tailor... ...is most likely to get all his clothes stitched from him. Where is Modern Tailors? - Modern Tailors... Liyaqat Ali? - Yes. Go straight and take a right. First floor. - From here? - Yes. - Thank you. - You are welcome. I am a social worker. I am attached with AIIMS. I wanted to enquire about Mr. Vakil. I know him for the past 23 years. Was this an accident or some police case? I don't know that. My job is to find out if he has any relatives. I don't know of any relatives. But there is a lady with whom he was acquainted with... ...for the past many years. Minu Rastogi. She was a prostitute in Paharganj. Mr. Vakil's acquaintance with her was still strong. Then she should know about his death. Where does she stay? - Where is D-40? - The second house. Yes? ls Minu Rastogi here? Who are you? Mumbai Police. I want to speak with her. Please come in. - Hello! - Hello! Please have a seat. Harish... - Yes, Ma'am. - Come here. Get this medicine. Yes, Ma'am. Please sit. - Sugar? - One spoon. I have diabetes. My doctor has completely banned sugar for me. You are young. - Here... - Thank you. How did Mr. Vakil's fame reach the Mumbai police? It's a long story. I have a lot of time. - Got the medicine? - No, Ma'am. - Did you look properly? - Yes, Ma'am. If I find it later, you know I'll shoot you, right? Yes. I keep my servants on a tight leash. Go do your work. Actually... I hadn't sent Harish to get medicine. I had sent him to see if there are cops outside. No, no, I have come alone. O God, strange are your ways! The person my son is looking for in the whole city... ...is sitting right here in his own house. And that too all alone! That boy who calls you, is my son. Karan. What do you call him? The kid. This is his house. What's happening to you? Feeling dizzy? Oh yeah... I put sedatives in your tea. Now you won't be capable of doing anything. And my Karan will be back in some time. You killed Vakil, right! My Karan will torture you to death. What fun it'll be! Hello, Ma'am! How are you? Hey... I am Walt. Actually my name is Karan. But I have changed it to Walt. It's the name of the hero in an English show. So you did keep your promise. You found me on the 27th day. That's amazing. Congratulations! I will keep my promise too. I won't kill you. I'll just bring you to a state... ...where you'll beg me to kill you. You! Mom, what's for lunch? Are all the girls ready? Alka, you are on what's app again! - Sorry, Ma'am. - They will be here soon. I'll get them ready in just five minutes. How many times have I told you that don't doll them up like kids? Those rascals should see their lovers in them not daughters. Honey, please. Thank you. Open your mouth... Properly... Good girl! That's good. And don't behave like a fool there. Be sexy! Good girl! Did you get what Ma'am is saying? No, no, don't tie her hair. Remove the pins. Quick. Quick. Thank you. Look at that. Aren't you looking ravishing now! - Go put on your shoes. - Be careful. - And put on a smile. - Keep it down. - Did you get that woman! - Yes. - Yes, Ma'am. - Very good. She's very strong. - Look how she's still fighting. - Wait! Who is she? I don't know. - Wait! - Get back to work everybody! ls everyone ready? Alka, anyone left? No, Ma'am, all are ready. Should I take them downstairs? No, no! I am going to perform here now. Everybody please wait and watch. Come on. Get out and be ready. - Off you go! Come on! - Yes, go on. Come on. You foreigner, come on. Get out. - Look at her desperate attempts! - Let her try! She's not asking you. Julia, there's no movie being shown here. Go. Go, or else I'll slap you! Go! Go! We still have to deck her up. Get her out of the sack. - Open it. - Yes, Ma'am. Ma'am, please co-operate. Why are you fighting so much? Hang on, hang on. There, it's open. Hold it Madam. Cool down. Get lost! Listen girl! I have been doing this since before you were even born! I know exactly how to tame the likes of you! Just untie my hands and see... ...you won't have a tongue left to speak or eyes to see! Hit her! There's no use talking to her! Don't hit the face. Au ntyl ' pvaari! Hey! Wait! - Aunty! Please! - Pyaari! Please, please! Let her go! Let me meet her. Once, just once. I'll do whatever you say. Do my make-up. Saw Mattu! That's how you fix such dames! Get your make-up done. ' Pvaari! I slapped her hard. Pyaari... All this is because of me. NO, Au nty! I am alive because of you. Enough of this nonsense! Enough! Stop it! Stop this emotional melodrama. Come on! Aunty, no! - You have to get your make-up done. - Take her away! Aunty! Now, it's looking beautiful. Hi, darling! Oh hi! Long time. Take good care of them, sweety. Please come, Sir! The whole arrangement is especially for you. Thank you. Everything is ready, Sir. Sir... Hi, good evening. Sir, when will Mr. Taneja come? - He will come at his own time. - Oh yes. Of course! You first show me your arrangements. - Please come, Sir. - Sir, your phone... Angie, baby, wait. Right now he's just checking things out. He'll come later. Come, Sir. Security is very tight. It's for your benefit, Sir. Only when there's no fear of being photographed... ...can a person enjoy freely. Julia, come, baby. Come, come, for Sir. Don't be shy. Sir... Girls get abducted in our cities for free... In broad day light. But when one guy sets up a small organized business... ...and everyone gets upset! Why did you do all of this? What did you get? You women get personal too soon. I agree that you are a cop, from the crime branch. But to obsessively chase just one criminal? What kind of professionalism is this? Where did you learn this? Nonsense. That's why we men climb on top and you women just stare at the ceiling. You know what I am saying, Miss Shivani? The night is young. Stare at the ceiling and scream your lungs out. Scream? Scream. That's right. There's no point. Crime branch! Sir has come. Good evening, Sir. This is Mattu! - Welcome, Sir! - God bless you. - How are you? - All good. Everything's ready for you. Welcome, Sir! - All well? - With your blessings. - Please come, Sir. - Tandon... Wait here. Come, Sir. Come, Sir. Tandon, have you checked everything personally? Yes, Sir. You are bound to be happy with the arrangements. Come, Sir. - Everything's ready. - This way, Sir. Sir, to your left. The arrangements look great. Yes. You are the one who gave us the opportunity to serve you. There's a special gift for you in the suite upstairs. You should check it out if you are in the mood. Everybody knows. Be it the opposition or women... ...l am always in a mood to crush! Spoken like a true leader! Brilliant, brilliant, I say! Hello! I have heard a lot about you. You? Yes, I am who you think I am. Everybody has their own hobbies. lam sure even you do. My hobby is this. Have you really come to rape me? I don't know how one pretends to rape. You fight with all your strength. Only then it'll be fun. You want to rape me! Get up! Come on! Stop this party! Get out! What is happening? Walt, where the hell are you? - Get out! - What is going on, Mattu! Where did she come from! She has lost it! Karan Rastogi, do you want this minister alive or not? Tandon! Do something, Tandon! Mattu, wait! Karan, if anything happens to Sir... ...you and your mom will die a miserable death. One second, Ma'am. What do you want? I want all the girls out. What are you staring at, Alka? Send all the girls out. - Girls, go out. - Come on! Mattu, are you dead! Come on, Julia. Angie, baby, hurry up. Scarlett, go. Hurry up! Fast. Fast, girls! Fast! Hurry up, Alka. - Pyaari, wait. - Au nty. - Mattu! - Yes? Give the key of the mobile locker to Pyaari. Give her the damn key. You got the girls. What else do you want? You. You will come with me. Chill, Ma'am. Chill. Chill, it's okay. - Step back. Step back. - Help! - Help! - Raise your hands. Tell them that no one moves from here till you get back. Nobody moves from here. Tandon, keep him in check. You wait. Everybody, we have got a bit of a situation. lam going to son it out and be right back. Raise your hands! Move! Move! Come on. Move quickly! Look ahead. Damn! She has locked the door! Come on quickly. Aunty, but the exit is this side. We are not going out. Open it! Open! Get in. Come on, girls. Get in. Be there. Pyaari, close the door. Lock the door. Lock it! - Okay, okay. - Get in! Get in! Not bad, Ma'am. Not bad at all. You guys think we cops are morons, right? But how did you manage to do this? When I got the address to your place... ...l had no clue that it is your house. - Where is D-40? - Second from the front. In crime branch we are trained to... ...carefully scan a place before entering. - Does Minu Rastogi stay here? - Yes, she does. Who else stays with her? Her son and a servant. How old is the son? Around 25-26. I was wondering what to do next when I heard a sound. Maybe God was trying to tell me something. I had heard this Azaan before. But where? Then I remembered. But you can't do any harm to me. Because I am still alive. And I am comfortably sitting in my own house. That is the first time I wondered if you are Minu Rastogi's son. But then who will take a risk with you? I began watching your house. I spotted you the next day. Although, I hadn't seen you before. But one look at your sly face... ...and I knew it had to be you. The first thing I did was put a GPS tracker in your car. 48 hours went by... ...you didn't go to any of your hostels or warehouses. I wanted to reach Pyaari... ...and also the other girls. Even if we did arrest you, what could we charge you with? That's when I decided that there's no point wasting time. Now you yourself will take me to Pyaari. I entered your house but I was fully prepared. I just had to make the move at the right time. Now I just need to inform Sodhi. He'll track us on the GPS and come here with the police unit. Pyaari, get the phone. And what if I would have killed you right then? I had to take that risk. Like I said, I knew your type. You wouldn't kill me that easily. You would want to exploit me like other women. I must give it to you. But what now? Sodhi, come. The police will take at least 25 minutes to get here. Your freedom lies behind that door. And I am standing in between you and your freedom. Kill me and claim your freedom. Women... women... Take everything personally, right? Come on. Let me see how far on top a man can climb. As you wish. Aunty! Get up! Get up! Hit me, Ma'am. How much will you hit me? You will me hit me a little and then arrest me, right? You are forgetting one thing, Ma'am. This is India. Over here, if you have the right contacts... ...the biggest of scandals can be buried. This is trivial in comparison. So till then you hit me and have fun. Hit me, Ma'am. There is nothing else you can do. This is India. This one thing you are right about. This is India. 'This' is what goes on here. These people sitting outside will bury your crime? They can do it only if you reach the police station. But you won't reach the police station because this is India. Here, if you don't want to bother the court too much... ...issues can be settled this way. Get up! Some people call it an 'Encounter'. Some call it 'Teaching a lesson'. Get up! Some also call it the 'Lokpal Bill'. What's your plan? Are you going to murder me? In front of everyone? This is India. In India, if 50 people take the law in their hands... ...and kill someone, then it's not called a murder. It's called 'Public outrage'. From right now, never again will I let you crush my pride You can have my body slain but you can't have my soul tied From right now, never again will I let you crush my pride You can have my body slain but you can't have my soul tied Touch my heart and I promise you will mean the world to me But if you ever mess with me I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget If you think being a man gives you the right to sell me like cattle I will in that same place destroy your entire race Hold my hand and walk with me and I will never leave your side But if you ever mess with me I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget In a skin or a saree, at day or at night I will not walk afraid I won't lead a life full of fear and regret In a world where mothers and sisters are not a blessing but a curse I will break all shackles of rules belonging to this world Change the way you look at me and I will shield you from the evil eye But if you ever mess with me I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget Walt died on his way to the hospital. Mattu became a prosecution witness. He revealed everything about Walt, Minu and Vakil along with Tandon's involvement to the court. First, the girls made up Minu's face. And then God did. Minu later suffered a paralysis attack. Taneja survived and is now in Tiharjail. His scarred face is an amusement to most in the jail. Today, we could bring back the smile on Pyaari's face. But there are many like Pyaari that have to be rescued from this muck. Many others like Karan Rastogi who are still scat-free... must be stopped. The Mardaani (Fighter) that's hidden within... has to be discovered by every woman, every girl herself. The war is still on.
