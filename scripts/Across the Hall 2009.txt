Hauser kicked my ass again. - You got to stop playing ball with that guy, man. Thinks he's playing every game at Rucker Park. - You don't need to tell me that. Speaking ofwhich, we called your ass. What, you can't call people back?. What's the matter with you?. - You know, I was waiting for my anytime minutes, man. You know, fucking nights and weekends. - You and your nights and weekends.

She's cheating on me. - Wait a minute, what?. - June, she --- she's cheating. - You'll be happy to know this elevator is very reliable. - As opposed to?. - The Riverview is fully inspected and certified, of course. But we are in a... transition period currently. This is our only working lift. - I'm quite happy to take the stairs. - This room is a personal favorite of mine. Everything in here is original. Preserved in time. You'll be joining some very distinguished company. - I bet. - Some of the first guests at the Riverview were the Ambassador to Estonia and the conductor of the Chicago Philharmonic and... and, of course, uh... numerous celebrities and movie stars. - Really?. Like who?. - Oh. Well, I'm not at liberty to divulge their names. - Oh. - Um... But rest assured, the names would impress you. - I'm sure. Oh. Thank you for the history lesson. - You're welcome. - So here. - Oh, it's--- - No. Have a wonderful evening. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Hi. - Come on, man, you really think she's cheating?. - I do. - 'Cause, I mean, you know, you've thought this before. Yeah, I know I've thought this before. - You've called me. - I know. - And every time, you end up just--- - Feeling like an asshole, yes. I know. It's different. - Okay. - She was supposed to be away on business. The airline, they called the house. She canceled her flight. - Just 'cause she canceled her flight doesn't mean--- - Then I gave the guy at her car service a $20. Told me where she was going. So I went to see for myself. - You followed her?. - I did... to the fucking hotel. - A hotel?. - That's right. - Shit. Oh, shit, man. So what are you gonna do, huh?. Are you gonna confront her?. - Yeah, you might say that. - Terry, where are you?. Come on, you're not--- are you--- Are you still at the hotel?. - Still?. No, not still. Where were you?. Why weren't you here?. Hmm?. - Terry, do you know what you've done?. - Yeah. Look, look, I need you to help me fix this. - Fucking stay away from me, Terry. - What?. - Just stay back. - Jules, look, I need your help here, man. That's why you came here, right?. So we can do this together, like you said. - No, dude, I never said--- I never told you to do this. - You told me to wait, and I waited. - Yes, fucking wait. - You left me here. - Okay, so what the fuck do you want me to do now, Terry, huh?. What can I do about this?. - I want to make him pay for it. - Good evening, sir. Would you like a room?. - A room, yeah. - I, um... I believe we have--- - It has to be the right room. - You've---you've stayed with us before?. - I've never been here before. - But you have a--- you have a particular room in mind. - I don't know the number, but I know what room I want. Is it okay if--- Please?. Here. That's her. I know her no matter what name she uses. - One moment, sir. I'll ring her room. - No, you can't--- can't do that. - I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not allowed to let you in unannounced. - Unannounced?. - She requested privacy, sir. - You saw her, then?. - Yes. - She's here. - Yes. - Well, I can't let her leave, then. And I need you to give me a room. I'm here for a room. Someplace across from--- I need room 508. How much for the night?. - Oh, um... I'm sorry. That room's not available this evening. - Why don't we go up there together and take a look?. - I can't. - Surprise yourself sometimes what you can and can't do. - Previous guests include the Ambassador to Estonia and the conductor of the Chicago Philharmonic. We never fill this room. The guests complain about the sign outside the window. I can close the blinds for you. - No, it's--- Just leave it. It's fine. There's a lot of history to this place, huh?. - Oh, yes, sir. All of the cornice work you see is original. Nothing has been changed since the day the Riverview opened. - I always thought it's just better to let it fall the fuck apart than cheat it of a past. It's not right, you know?. To renovate the soul right out of a place. You ever wish you could just keep things exactly the way they were?. That you could just hold on to a moment in time like it was... Fuck this. - I can't believe this is happening. I can't believe it. - What part?. What part can't you believe?. - I don't know, all of it. - Hey, but--- I'll have to go like this from now on. - You believe how much I love you, don't you?. - Of course. - And you believe how much l--- I mean it, how much I just mean everything I say, all of it. - Yes. Though not everything, everything. Hey, I didn't mean it like that. Hey, forget about it. I didn't mean it in a bad way. - I know. I only get like that when I'm scared, you know. I only talk like that when I'm scared. - I get scared too, Terry. We all get scared. - Are you scared of me?. - No. No, no, no. I get scared of us, though. - Scared of us?. - Yeah. Too powerful sometimes. - Hey. - Yeah?. - I don't want you scared of me. I don't ever want to do anything or say anything, hurt you. - Shh. I'm here. I'm right here. She said yes. Yes, she did, didn't she?. - Yes, she did. - Yeah. - She yelled it. I can't believe you. Shit. - What?. - I got to call Jules. - No, can't--- Why don't we just enjoy this alone?. - We got to celebrate, don't we?. No?. - Just tonight, just the two of us. - Baby, it's Jules. - I know. - I got to tell him. - Hello. - Julian, hey. - Terry?. What time is it?. - No, I have no idea. We've been up all night. Listen, man, um... We're getting married. - Wow. So you guys are still--- - Still?. No, not still. Actually, Jules--- Actually, I had to stop by your place for a minute. - Wait, you were here?. Why?. - Just listen, man, all right?. Just listen. I was gonna leave a note so they'd know you were free from blame or whatever. - What?. Terry, what are you talking about?. I don't even know what you're saying. - I had to--- I had to borrow something. - What?. Terry, what?. - I only came to talk, man. It's not like I planned--- I don't know--- - Okay, fine, so then we're talking now, right?. - It's too late for that, Jules, all right?. - Terry, it's not too fucking late. Come on, man. - I know you keep the---the--- the bullets hidden, so I had to go buy some. Not even sure I got the right size. I mean, do different handguns take different bullets?. I don't know. - Terry. - I only know what I've seen on Law and Order. - Okay, hang on. - I don't watch CSI. - Hold it. You have my gun?. - Yeah, I'm sorry. - Terry, you stole my gun?. - Dude, I'm sorry. - That's a fucking shitty thing to do, man. - Yeah, I hear you, man. - Okay, Terry, what are you going to do?. Are you going to shoot him?. - I might. - Okay, you're gonna kill him?. - I might, yeah. - What, you want fucking Jerry Orbach, fucking the other guy, whatever the fuck his name is, you want them coming through your door, hauling your ass off to jail?. - What am I supposed to do, Jules?. - I could think of a couple things. - You wouldn't let it go. - Wh-wh-what is that supposed to mean?. - You wouldn't let some girl treat you like this. I mean, that's what you said. - Yeah, but dude, I never fucking said that with a gun in my hand, Terry. - It doesn't matter now anyway, man. - No, this does matter. Terry, you keep--- You do this, man. How am I ever supposed to trust you?. You keep pulling this bullshit. I mean, this shit is in your head, Terry. You keep--- you put it on me, and then you put it back on her. Terry. Terry, come on, man. Listen to me, all right?. You are just really scaring me right now. - I'm not asking you for anything more, Jules. This is it. No more phone calls, no more... jobs. It's the last time. I promise. - Terry, where are you?. - I'm at the Riverview. Across the hall from them. - You're not. - I am. - You're across the hall. - Room 508. Nonsmoking. Check out at noon. Gonna smoke this cigarette and then, you know... head on over there. - All right, um... Fuck, how about this?. How about---what if l--- what if I met you there?. - Here?. At the hotel?. Yeah, dude, I could be there in, like--- I mean, I can be there in, like, 20 minutes. You give me--- give me 20 minutes. But listen, man, you have to sit tight, all right?. You have to promise me you're gonna put that fucking gun away and that you're gonna sit tight, all right?. That's the deal. Terry, come on, man, - 20 minutes, man. You got it. - All right, Listen, man, I'm telling you. We're gonna be sharing drinks in no time, man. We're gonna laugh about this, all right?. - Jules, man... what would I do without you?. - June. Hey. June. We got a problem. Hello?. - Hey, it's me. - Hey, what's going on?. I was wondering, are you free to get together tonight?. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I can do that. Is everything all right?. - No, I'm fine. I'm here at this hotel. - The Riverview, you know?. - Right. - And I kind of needed to talk. - Riverview. - Do you know how to get here okay?. - Yeah. No, no, no. I-I know it well. Wow, Anna. - This is not the third floor. - No, no, this is the lobby. - Floor?. - Uh, 507---five. So you're back in town, obviously. - Mm-hmm. Just for business. - Right. I didn't know you were so sentimental, Anna. - You don't have to flatter yourself, Julian. - I'm just saying--- - Expense account isn't exactly cut out for the Waldorf. I'm not staying here for the memories. Did you know that the Ambassador of Estonia stayed here?. - I didn't know that. That's great. - Mm-hmm. So what are you doing here of all places?. Or don't l want to know?. - Nothing, I'm just seeing a friend. - Really?. A friend. They just call you up like room service now or what?. - Hmm. - Well, it's nice to know I can still make you uncomfortable. - I'm sorry.

I need to talk to him. - No. No, you cannot call him. - Why not?. - Because he's got a gun. - He's got a gun?. - I don't know, maybe he's got a gun?. Probably he doesn't. - Well, which is it?. I don't know. Maybe---maybe he's got my gun. - Jules, you mean to tell me--- - Stop, stop, stop, stop, listen to me. Listen to me, you cannot say my name. Terry is directly across the hall, okay?. He's in the room right across the hall. So we just need to relax. We can do this. Yeah?. We can do this. It's Terry, for God sakes. - Oh, shit. Of course you pick a room on the fifth fucking floor. - Got to call the police. - Shit. Fuck.

Just play along, please. - Room service. - Listen to me. The guy at the door. - Yeah. - That guy is the porter, okay?. I just need you to talk to him. Can you do that for me?. I will keep Terry on the phone, I promise you. I'll keep him talking. I'll be right here for you. I'll be right in that room. Can you do that?. - Get in the room and shut the door. - You can do this. - Keep him on the phone. - Julian?. Jules?. - Yeah, Terry. Terry, I am here, man. I'm here.

And they--- and they... must've slept together, right?. - I don't know, Terry. I mean, I guess so. - So they'll know it was him. - I can't, man. I cannot frame an innocent man. - Wait, innocent?. You tell me how he's innocent. - Okay, I didn't mean--- - You know what?. He's the one who did this, Jules. He's the reason she's dead. - Okay, Terry, Terry, I know, all right?.
