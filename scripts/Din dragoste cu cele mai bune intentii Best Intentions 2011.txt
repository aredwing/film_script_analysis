What am I s'posed to do if I don't?! Okay... bye... Did you really throw them out? - Delia! Did you? - I told you to throw them out... You keep a lot of crap! How many times did I tell you? But that's not the way to do it! You could've told me beforehand! Really love, what's the big deal You've had them for 10 years! I hope you're not upset... They were in tatters! Of course I'm upset! They were a souvenir... A souvenir, right... Perhaps Alinuta gave them to you... Not Alinuta... I got them in the Army. You're making such a fuss for some briefs you wore in the Army?! Really now... You have a way to... it's not the fucking briefs! They were old, torn and yellow! But they were a souvenir! Don't you have thingies like this? No! I don't keep You're such a smartass! You've covered the fridge with those ugly magnets! C'mon, love... They were yellowish and the elastic was loose. Why did you Keep them in the drawer if your mom gave them to you? You should've put them in that memorabilia box of yours. - Or frame them! - I keep them Where I Want! Are you upset, or something? Did I keep them among your panties, or something? - How were they hindering you? - You really are upset! - Alex... - Leave me alone... From now on, you'll clean up all by yourself! Well, I don't wanna... This is the last time I take care of your things! No shit! Gabi... Why is it so complicated to send me that link? I got that, but I Wanna check it beforehand, okay? Okay... Did you check with KLM, too? How much?! Aha... No, no... No, no... Okay, bye... Why are you so upset? If anything, I should be the one... - I'm not upset... Bye, Kiss ya... - Well... don't you?! I'll kiss you tonight... maybe... BEST INTENTIONS thursday Yeah... Gabi, really, what's so complicated?! So... as you're walking on the right, on Pache Blvd... yeah, you go past Izvor... Okay man, on Elisabeta Blvd. If you pref en on the right... it's an orange sign, B something... it's an open air pub. At 4 o'clock, right... But mind you! You can't see it from the street, you have to go in first. No, the beer is on me... Because I Want to. Okay see ya there. Bye... Hi dad, how are you? What a surprise... I was about to go out... You? I got time, tell me... No, not later. Tell me now. No, tell me now! What happened? Dad... Dad! What?! When is he gonna tell you? Okay... Call me... I'll be Waiting... Gabi... I can't meet with you, sorry... Mom's not okay and I have to go home... Thanks, but there's nothing you can do... Bye. I see... Whenever I need you, you don't have time, your battery's empty, or I don't know What! Yeah, I am, 'cause that's the way you are! Dad called and told me that mom was taken to the hospital... A stroke... They x-rayed her and now dad's going to the doctor's to see what's going on. Dad... He called me... He was scared... He Went to the hospital and found mom in a wheelchair, repeating herself... She couldn't remember how she got there! He couldn't reason with her 'cause she kept repeating herself, don't you get it? And the doctors told him that it's a blood vessel which is either obstructed or broken and causes internal hemorrhage. Why? Does Susu Know about these things? Okay, I'll call him.. Listen, I'm leaving by the 17:15 train... No, what can you possibly do? Okay, bye... Hello Hi Susu, Alex her... Hi Susu, Alex her... Well... not very well, 'cause I have a problem... Mom had a stroke and she's in the hospital... Dad called and told me that shes speaking nonsense and keeps repeating the same question... Right... Right... I don't know... The doctor's explaining it to dad as we speak... Got it! What's his name?! Crisan?! Got it! Okay Susu, thanks... I'll ask and I'll call you back... I don't know... I'll talk to my dad and then I'll call you back... Okay Susu, Thanks... So... Tell me... Thank God, dad... Listen, ask for the CD with the X-ray because I Wanna send it to Cluj so that $u$u can look at it... What's the doctor's name? Fuck! Tell him I wanna move her to Cluj! Yeah, We have to! 'Cause I Want to! Tell him that I have a friend in Cluj and I wanna move her there. Listen, I have a train at 17:15... Of course I'm coming! What pajamas?! Okay, bye... I called dad to tell him to move her to Mrs. Nuti and he's getting on my nerves saying he's ashamed of the doctor. Yeah... His wife's a professor at my mom's school... He says he owes him 'cause had it been 10 minutes later, the radiologist would've left... Really now! Apparently if it hadn't been for Crisan, they would've sent her to Arad even though Cata said it's dangerous to move her... I hope... That's what they said... Wait a sec... Hello... Yeah... Given the rush, I hope they read the X-ray properly... Can you please close the door? Thank you... Or maybe the doctor didn't tell the truth? Why wouldn't he? 'Cause that's what they do in critical situations around here... What, ain't it so? I'd rather not tell you than make you suffer... What do you mean okay if she keeps repeating herself?! Okay... Talk to you later... Bye... Sorry for cutting in... I heard you talking and I Wanted to tell you my sister suffered a similar stroke... - That's it, right? - Yeah... You should move her someplace safer... to Bucharest... Oh, I'll move her to Cluj, for sure! Or to Bucharest... I'll see... Well, of course! I heard a lot of things about hospitals... I have a friend. She fell ill recently... Poor thing, she had ah awful migraine! She Went to the hospital. They sent her to the eye doctor when, in fact, she had had a stroke and it was too late... Yeah... Hi Susu... Yeah, I asked but I didn't understand it very Well and I didn't dwell upon it, either... Anyway, he said something about a transitory ischemic... What does it mean? I see... Really?! Okay... And transitory'? How am I not to think about it?! Transitory ischemic sounds like shit... Transitory towards What? Okay thanks a lot, and sorry for... Okay I'll call you later. Bye! Well yeah... Transitory sounds bad but, apparently, it comes from transition towards good... The first 24 hours are critical, ma'am. Only if she's not being taken care of... 'Cause if she is... They didn't say anything about this. They're critical anyway So, until morning, it can be very bad... Listen to this... A coworker of mine, poor thing... His father, a man in his 80s had some sort of cancer... And he bought him vitamins... the good, expensive ones... He thought it would help his body... But Within a month, his father was dead... The doctors told him that it was a bad idea, 'cause those vitamins sped up the cancer process... Without them, he could've lived another 10 years! You can imagine how the poor man must be feeling... He only Wanted to do something good... Do you know what's great for this disease? Let me tell you the secret... Propolis and Water... - Sorry I cut in... - Don't Worry! But I'd rather you didn't, 'cause it doesn't help me. Hi! Listen, I talked to Susu and he says that it's okay for now. He says we should move her to Nuti, 'cause she's the neurologist. No, Crisan is a neurosurgeon. No, I don't know what the difference is... What do you mean she's crying?! Because I'm coming home?! And why wouldn't she talk?! How not to worry, Delia?! If there are aftereffects, she might not even recognize me or we might never speak to each other as We did before... Okay... Got it... Okay... Bye... Stop being so pessimistic, Sir, 'cause it doesn't help, anyway... It will be alright! You must say it over and over again: It will be alright! 'Cause it will, damn it! Dad! Hi... - You've turned kinda gray... - Is this all the luggage you have? I have some clothes at home... Let's go to the can - You come here by car? - How else? I've just found the pajamas she kept asking me about... I thought she was talking nonsense, but I found it. I don't Know why she wants precisely this one... I don't Know why she bought so many of them... Look! It's pink... She has others, too... There are about ten of them in her closet. To the right... - Is she still on perfusions? - Yeah... - But is she still repeating herself? - I didn't notice... You know, when I Went to the hospital it was awful. She was just being moved from Radiology in a Wheelchair She looked at me, absent-minded. She had murky eyes, as if she were on drugs and she asked me where she was and what had happened. There are two other ladies in her Ward. One of them, poor thing, was in a dreadful car accident on that curve in Hateg. All her family is in hospital. The car is a wreck, I saw it on TV Her face... you'd be horrified if you saw it. And the girl... she's in the 7th grade. Both her feet are broken. Thank God it's not Worse! God, it reeks in here... Can mom undress all by herself and stuff like that? Yeah. She remembers what she did this morning, because I tested her with questions. What she was Wearing... She remembers everything. She knows that today they installed video cameras at the school. Then she only remembers about being in the ambulance and asking them to turn off the siren 'cause she was embarrassed. But the worst thing was that she Kept whispering to me, though the other two could hear her, "Donn, go bring me those pink pajamas and a pair of panties". I'd nod and, a couple of minutes later, shed start all over again Go bring me those pink pajamas". I didn't know what to say any more... People are unbelievable beings... One single screw loosens and you're gaga already! Did you tell Crisan about Nuti? Yeah, I did, but... He said that he also studied neurology and that he's good at it. He's good at shit, dad! Susu told me he'll butt in and that we have to move her under Nu;I's care... He said he'd treated patients like your mom before and everything will be alright... Can't you understand that he really Wants to help us?! He should mind his own business! We need a neurologist! - You'll talk to him in the morning... - I can hardly Wait! - But it ain't nice! - I can hardly Wait! To the right... To the right and in the back... Do you think it's Wise for mom to see me? Delia told me she was crying because I'm coming... - What do you mean, crying? - I don't know! Delia said her mom told her that she saw mom crying... Yeah, 'cause she kept asking when you'd get here... - Are you afraid, or something? - I ain't afraid... Over here! She ain't asleep... - Good evening! - Oh, you're here! - Hi, mom. - Hi, dear... - What happened to you? - Eh... Well... It happened... Why did you come? Why trouble yourself? I couldn't have stayed in Bucharest. I was scared... - Listen, give me my kit... - What kit?! My make-up kit. It's in that drawer somewhere... But didn't you have Work to do Meet with Sarbu... - I did. There's no hurry... - Eh... Well... It happened... - How are you feeling? - Now I'm fine... But I don't Know why I'm so sleepy... I'd die for a coffee... Yeah, that's all you need right now... You should go to sleep. - How are you? - Fine... - The lady's puttin' some lipstick on... - Why are you putting lipstick on? What are you so scared about? I am... Why would you put lipstick on, when you should get some sleep? - Shes soiled herself... - What time is it, mom? - What do you Want from me? - Tell me... it's morning... Why are you so scared? Mom, please, listen to me... it's late at night. You took a pill and you need some rest. Look outside, it's dark... So what if it's dark? Call the nurse... Push the red button... - Call Crisan, please! - At this hour'?! - Give me the phone, I'll call him! - Hand me the mirror to see myself... Give her the mirror... - What happened? - Nothing... Hello, good evening... Sorry to bother you so late... Alex David here... Yeah, I just got here, and I think mom has another one of those crisis... She thinks it's morning, she's confused... she put lipstick on... Yeah, she's here... Right away... Sorry... I have the doctor on the phone... Yes, doctor. She was putting some make-up on... I'm Wearing this so that my girl won't get scared... I told my son about the accident... - Okay mom, calm down... - Mr. David... Thank you... Hello... I'm very sorry... it's because of the sedatives, don't Worry. The doctor gave her more, so that she could sleep. She's fine... Now you Woke him up! It's because of the sedatives... - What did he say? - I told you, that it's the sedatives! - Why did he tell you to go outside? - He didn't! I went out so that she won't wake up. Why are you panicking? 'Cause the first 24 hours are critical, thats Why! She'll be alright, don't Worry. Why did you put her like this? She's going to fall. No... If she needs something she can signal it to me and I can take her to the bathroom... She asked me earlier. - I just hope she won't fall! - Give me those pajamas... If she needs it overnight, I'll take care of her... We'll see about it in the morning... Let's go! - I'd rather stay here with mom... - What's the point?! Why stay?! shes not alone here, you know! - Shes definitely going to fall! - Fall where?! She can't fall! Are you sure it ain't better if I stayed? Why? Don't you see the lady's here?! She won't move 'til morning! All day she's been restless 'cause her son was about to come. Now he's here, so she fell asleep... Let's go! Goodbye, thank you... Wait a sec... - I'm gonna give you my number... - Sir, please don't! - I don't have a mobile... - I have one! Give it to me! If anything happens, call me... - Okay... - Thank you! Good night... I'm going to the hospital. Finish your plate! We've just come back... Honestly now, what did he tell you out on the corridor? - Sorry? - On the corridor... That he rebuked the nurse for allowing visits so late, that he gave her the sedatives... He was very nice, you know... If it hadn't been for him... He personally took care of the Ward... He took her over from the ambulance 'cause his Wife had called... I got it, but there's nothing to talk about! Tomorrow morning, we move her to Cluj. I'll talk to Crisan, what's the big deal'?! He's always looking after her. He's taking good care! That's what's bothering me! So What, he's looking a&er her? I get it! Mom helped his wife and he wants to show us how grateful he is. I'm going to thank him for this. But you cant behave like this, he'll get upset... He really helped us! You have no idea what we've been through! What about the CD with the X-Ray Why didn't he give it to you, huh? Everywhere in this world you have to give the CD to the patient! - He was in a hurry huh?! - He came back for your mom! For mom, huh?! So, if it hadn't been for mom, he wouldn't have come back... You think that's normal?! That's the way it is... Do you have any idea how nice everyone's been? Very helpful... You have no idea how busy it is in the ER! Dad... If I had had the CD, I'd have moved her in the morning. You Know perfectly well that it's dangerous for her to be here! You know what happened to Cristina's mom?! You've told me already... - Do you Want another beer? - Yeah, if you have some, too... - Let's have a beer! - It's in the fridge? I'll talk to Crisan. I understand that it's difficult for you... Yeah, 'cause we'd fight and I might need him again someday - Cheers! - Cheers! After all, everything's fine now... - Why did she want those pink pajamas? - She had nothing to sleep in. - I mean why the pink ones... - How should I know?! I was surprised, too... - I'm going to the hospital... - Stop it! At this hour'?! Mom's asleep! Oh, you haven't seen the cats yet! Do you Know how big the little one's gotten? Mitzu... Hey kitty kitty... - shes asleep, don't Worry! - You've startled me! Good evening... I mean morning, 'cause it's very late... I can't sleep... I have a terrible headache. I'Ve just come to see if everything's alright. Don't worry, I'm here, too. I'm in terrible pain... My back, my face... Don't they give you sedatives, or something? No, I'm allergic to them... I can't even go to the dentist, I can't be anesthetized. That's bad... If it bothers you, I can put the mask on. Don't Worry! Is your girl alright? Yes, poor think is in the next Ward. Both her thighbones are fractured. They won't operate on her, so both her legs are bandaged She's only 12! What about your husband? I heard he's in Petrosahi... Yeah, he had to stay back there, he has a pelvic fracture. That's really bad! No, he's better than us. He called to encourage us... He said he'd run here" to see us. He's going to be immobilized for 2 months. Go home... I'm gonna take care of her. Great, thanks... Well, it's not great, but... I'm gonna go home... Go in peace. Good night. - We're going to move her to Cluj. - Really? - What do you think about it? - I don't know... Do as you feel. That's always the best. In Cluj it's okay, too... Yeah... I keep thinking about these 24 hours 'cause things can go awry... No, not that! I mean... that too... Think about it... What if tomorrow morning I won't be able to reason with her? What if there are aftereffects? We might hot be able to talk to each other as we did before... It would be as if I had another mother... Yeah... She recognized me, but... God, the look on her face... And the lipstick, right. And what if in the morning she starts repeating herself again? Yeah... Okay thanks. Kiss you to, bye. Friday friday - My God, why did you come'?! - Because... - He's my boy... - I met him last night, no?! But didn't you have Work to do? Meet with Sarbu... - We did, there's no rush... - Was I asleep when you arrived? - Fast asleep! - Don't you remember that we kissed?! Anyway, you fell asleep pretty fast, 'cause you were heavily sedated. I kinda remember... Right... I thought it was a dream... - Why didn't you Wake me up?! - What for?! I brought you some cottage cheese, tomatoes and bell peppers and later I'll buy you some yoghurt... Thanks hon', but I can't eat now. Later, after the blood test... When are they coming? In half an hour, followed by the doctor's visit. - You changed your pajamas'?! - I was soaking wet! Do you Know how hot it is at night'?! Terribly hot! But wait for July to start! Jeez... Crazy hot! Not even a drop of Water... The poor grass... But what can one do?! - She's crazy, huh? - Don't talk like that, poor thing! She has something in her brain... Crisan operated on her two days ago. She's on those Kinds of pills... That's why she's so happy But I don't think shes aware of what happened to her... Mom... dad says you don't remember how all this happened... I don't... I remember I was angry with some 7th graders, then, apparently, the ambulance arrived and I told them to turn the siren off. And my blood pressure was 18! I've never had that much, ever! But I don't remember any ambulance... I know I was angry with those kids... You've already told me about the kids... So what'?! Were you never angry with them before? How should I know?! This time, things went sour! Nothing Went sour! I've told you already... I talked to Haiduc and Susu and they assured me that there's nothing serious... These are the symptoms when a blood vessel is obstructed by fat. You don't even faint! - Wasn't Haiduc a gynecologist?! - He is, but he knows stuff... At first there's short term amnesia, and then you recover. I know, Crisan explained it to me, but I didn't understand a thing. He told me it happened because of the high blood pressure. - And you had some coffee, too... - Oh, ma'am, why didn't you say so'?! Not more than usual! But I got angry get it?! - And you really remember this? - The coffee'?! Sure! - Sure? - Sure! Oh, hon'... In my Whole life, I've never been in a hospital for more than two days, and now... I got sick! - You're not sick, it's just a syndrome. - It's called synpton! - Synpton? - Right... Rodica says I'll be on medication my Whole life... She's very nice... - Rodica who? - Lazar... You shouldn't listen to Rodica Lazar... Did she come by yesterday? She said that in order to not get angry, she takes a little pink pill every day Really! So, did she come by yesterday? Yeah! Okay I'm going to see Crisan, and if he says you're able to Walk, tomorrow we'll move you to Cluj. - Eh, move me'?! And who's Susu? - You know him... He was in the same class as Delia... I mean you know his mother... Suiaga... - Oh, Dani?! That was his name, I think... - Right! - And is he working in Cluj'?! - He's a neurolo... Neurosurgeon. - I mean he's still a resident, but he's good... - A surgeon'?! Since when? Is he married? I don't think... Does it matter'?! Why don't you want to be moved? Why move me'?! I thought about Bucharest, but Cluj is closer. Everybody does it. It's the same as here! Do you know how nice Crisan is? - Go! You said he's Waiting... - He's not Waiting... And he should have transferred you to Neurology, anyway... If it hadn't been for him... wow! He operated on me and I'm as good as new, see?! Ma'am, I fell down, out of nowhere! Really! I started puking... It was as if somebody had turned off the lights! Internal hemorrhage... Look at me! Can you see any hemorrhage on me?! - Go to him, he's Waiting! - I told you he's not Waiting! - Don't you remember?! - I do... Honestly? Do you remember I've just told you he's not Waiting? Stop fretting! I'm the one who told him you're coming... - I'm now stupid... - Don't get too excited... Okay... Don't forget to ask him about that pink pill... Go... - I'm Waiting for dad... - Ouch! What a cramp! Right, ho?! it tickles mel it's because of all this strings... The perfusion... Thank God I'm okay! See, Alexandru, this vague White blemish? That's a stroke with broken blood vessels! Your mother doesn't have it. She's clean... This means it was only a temporary obstruction of the vessel due to a dot of fat tissue. And is it normal for her not to remember? Yeah, amnesia is quite normal in such situations because that vessel might be in that area of the brain Where the memory is located... - What about the repetitions? - They are normal, too... The brain is like any other organ... It recovers in time... As you've noticed, there are no more repetitions. Is there the possibility of a relapse? Yeah, in about a year, unless she has a healthy lifestyle... In my opinion, healthy lifestyle" means less fat, less sweets... And I forgot to tell you about exercise... Exercise is crucial. Otherwise, in about 20% of the cases there is a relapse... -20%?! - Yeah. Got it. So, from now on, she's on a diet... I'm gonna call you back... I didn't say she has to be on a diet, I only said a healthy lifestyle... Which means she can eat whatever she wants, as long as it is healthy and she exercises... a lot. But if it ain't that serious, how can I explain her the amnesia to her? You don't explain it to her. I explain it to her! It's my duty right? As far as amnesia is concerned... One glass too many and we're all amnesiac You're right... Your mom was lucky I was on duty, 'cause otherwise it would've taken a lot of time. You know how things are in the ER... And I was lucky I was able to bring the radiologist back... Dad told me what you did for us and I'm really grateful... Now... and I'm telling this to everybody, because I understand the situation and human psychology... If you Want to move her to Cluj... I understand Alex nas a friend there... I'll have nothing against it, I won't get upset, but you should know that it would be better she stayed here... She's properly taken care of... And it's not too serious anyway... - it's basically the same treatment. - I think its okay to keep her here. Of course it's okay, but I'd be more relaxed if she were in Cluj, enjoying the best medical conditions... - Got it... - And, by the way... Please give me the CD with the X-Ray, cause I Wanna check beforehand if she can be moved... Please don't be angry because of my paranoia, but... I'm not angry! I get it... But there is one problem... I'd give it to you, but I don't have it... The radiologist Went to Germany and when he comes back... - But I can give you this... - Really? If it's allowed, sure... Allowed... well... it's 'cause it's you... I'll scan it and bring it back to you. Please do. Take this, too. You might need it. Sure, thanks... Thank you once again for everything and I nope you're not angry with me... Thank you, too. I think she should remain here but for his tranquility... What can I say?! I understand and I'm not angry... I have a mother, too... ...and from now on you should be more careful what you eat... - Less fat, more exercise, less stress... - So I'm on a diet! I was sure you'd say that! Yeah, you have to be a bit careful about what you eat, but it doesn't mean it's a diet! If Delia doesn't gulp on pork fat does it mean she's on a diet? As long as you don't eat everything you like, it's a diet! - What did he say about the pink pill? - Nothing... - He said not to listen to other people. - You didn't ask him... And did he tell you why can't I remember what happened? Yeah. Apparently that's what happens when a vessel is obstructed. In your case, the effect is the memory loss. - But it's a minor thing... - Minor? I can't remember a few hours and you say it's minor'?! Mom, remember when I Went on a trip to Sinaia and I got so drunk that I still can't remember half of that night? Remember? - What trip?! - To Semenic! A couple of years ago... People would come to me next day and ask me for cigarettes as if were the best of friends, and I couldn't remember anything. - The alcohol affected my memory... - But I didn't drink! You didn't... Please tell me if it's serious... Didn't he tell you anything? Mom, you're really something! You forgot some things, it's normal! - Are you finished? - Yeah, take it... it's a form of amnesia, but it's the easiest one. A couple of hours' amnesia and I'm on a diet for life! I'm really getting angry with you! What do you keep talking about the diet?! I told you it's not serious. Look, I have your radiography... I'll send it to Susu, too... Look... Broken blood vessels look like White stains. There aren't any White stains, so there're no broken vessels! Consequently, it ain't serious! Leave it... Alex, hon] I don't wanna move. Especially if I'm fine... - And Crisan is a really good doctor! - I'm not saying he ain't! But look at the state of this hospital! If only one nurse makes a mistake... - The staff is better in Cluj! - Everybody's been so nice to me! Two of the nurses used to be my students! - So what'?! - God, it's so hot... - They're very nice to me... - Yeah... I've been meaning to ask you... Why did you Want this pajama? - Because I was very hot. - But why this pink one? Don't you like it? I do, but you have other ten in your closet. Why this? - Why do you Keep asking me that? - Oh, hon', nice to see you! - Hi, Rodica! - Did you come by to see your mommy? Good for you! How's my little sick girl? They're so beautiful! Put them in that jar... - How are you? - I'm fine... A bit dizzy because of the perfusions and the blood samples they keep taking from me. You know what I brought you? Some cakes, my mom made them. She's not allowed cakes... No way there's sugar in them! There isn't any it's honey! We're not eating sugar any more. Sugar is poison! - And one won't hurt her... - Not even one! Leave it, Rodica... from now on, I'm on a diet... I'm a sick woman... I told you you're not sick! You just have to take care... Listen to me... it's the age! There's nothing serious. From now on, every day, you'll take, a small pink pill, same as me. - What pill'? - A little one. Calms you down. You're no longer feeling stressed. She has to take care of herself. She gets upset so easily... But the doctor didn't say anything about the pill. Believe me! The pink one does Wonders! She'll feel better. And there're no adverse effects. I don't know what to say... Alex dear, your mom is too stressed. And the retirement... And that damn inspector who wouldn't sign her request... Don't remind me of him, the doctor said I shouldn't get angry damn it! But he could've signed the request, he said he was your friend... - Alex wants to transfer me to Cluj. - I don't wanna talk about it... What a nice boy... I'm going now, but I'll be back in about two hours, okay? Cluj is a great idea! Their clinic is awfully great! - They took great care of my mom... - Bye! He's such a good boy! He's such a good boy! Crisan only said about the aspirin, but it's none of his business. And I'm afraid Rodica will set her mind on I don't Know what pink pill... And she brought her cakes, too... She's right about something, though... She's about to retire, and she might be stressed 'cause they didn't sign her request. No, she DOESN'T Want to retire. What's the hurry? Wait a sec... Mom's fine, she's under permanent observation... No shit! Yesterday you said it was better to keep her here! Now you had the epiphany?! Maybe... But maybe you're the one who doesn't see things right... Maybe you're the one who doesn't see how great things are over here... Maybe it's a mistake to move her! How can you know? I didn't say that! it's not that I don't Wanna transfer her... There're so many things to be done... What's the connection? I can take the fan with me, to Cluj, can't?! I don't see the connection! Yeah, mind your own business! I can manage on my own... Shit! Hello... What do you mean she's crying?! She's not okay... - She's been crying for a While... - What's up, mom? - Nothing... - Why are you crying, then? - Did anyone say anything to you? - No hon', I'm okay... C'mon mom, you're frightening me... - I'm okay... - Did Crisan come by? - Did he tell you anything? - I'm okay, really... - Then what are you crying for? - She started when Mrs. Rodica left. - So it's because of Rodica! - I don't know... - it's about your retirement?! - Yes... Let it be... I can't calm down. Please, go find Crisan and ask him to give me something... I'll call him, but calm down please,... - And the lady... '? - She's with her daughter... I'll go to Nuti and ask her to give you something, okay? But please calm down... I'll be back! Go, go... - Hi, Mrs. Nuti? - Over there! Hi, I've come to tell you that my mom's crying and she's really agitated and I can't find dr. Crisan and I don't know what to do... - You're Alex! - Yeah... I forgot to introduce myself... That's okay. You look like your mother. - Why is she crying? - I don't Know. I think she remembered about school... the retirement... - I found her like this. - I'm gonna give you a pill... it's not strong and it has no side effects. I take one everyday Look. Here... - Give her half, and... - Is it a sedative? Yeah! But give her only half, it's enough. - And is it okay? - I take one every day, I told you... But don't tell Crisan, or he'll get angry... Speaking of him... I Wanted to tell you that I trust your opinion. As far as I'm concerned, you have the last word. Okay, thanks... But don't Worry... You're mom had the easiest form. Shes fine. I checked her reflexes.. - Did you check on her?! - Of course! Thanks! I'll go give her the pill. Once again, thank you! Bye! - Who's your Contact in Cluj'? - Susu... Dan Suiaga. - Danut! He's a great kid! - Yes, he is. Bye... Here... She said half's enough for now. Okay hon', thanks... - Thank God it's not bitter! - But don't say anything to Crisan. Otherwise he'll get mad. Nuti asked me that... Go now... The doctor's about to come by I'm going... - Are you calm now? - I am... Go... Hi, hello... Hi, young man, still here? - What a good boy you have! - That's true, doc... What's going on? Why did we cry? These pink pills are useless, believe mel My cousin used to take them and she got Worse! - Rodica told you about Nuti, right? - No, a friend in Cluj... And he says she's fine. I'm not happy about that pill either, but as long as shes here, she'll have to take them... But who's this Nuti? I've never heard about her... - Nuti What? - Kelemen! Kelemen... She's Hungarian... And what are you going to do? Your dad told me you wanna move her to Cluj. As soon as they check her X-Ray and see it's not dangerous... See? it's better to Keep her here. Why move her'?! I'm here... We'll see about it... - How are things in Bucharest? - The same... Hot... - I'm really upset with you! - Why'? Why?! We'll talk about it later... What's up mom? Why was Crisan so upset? I couldn't lie to him. You Know I can't... I told him I took half of that pink pill... - Oh, mom! - So what's the big deal?! - I told him I was agitated! - Geta, you shouldn't haven! - It's hot soup. - I have no room left... - I'll go explain it to him... - Explain What? I'm sorry about that pill! I'm sorry about that pill! I've looked for you but I couldn't find you! The phone was off, mom was crying and I had to go to Mrs. Nuti... So you Know why I'm upset with you... - Yeah... - Alex, I get it... You care a lot about your mother. I have a mother, too. But that's not the way one does things round here... - I'm sorry but... - And Nuti was wrong, too... Definitely... No, no! I explained her that I couldn't find you and... - I panicked... - I get it... But imagine your mother didn't tell me about the pill... I could've given her something else... Some pills don't go well together... I know... What I did was Wrong, but I panicked... I cant help if you don't trust me! I'm in charge of this section! - I'm not a nobody... - That's not what this is about! - This is exactly what this is about! - That's how mom is... - She Wants to know everything... - That's very good! And if she wants to, I can give her some books on this matter Great, thanks! I'm sorry and... Wait... Don't go... Sit down... Let's talk... - How are things in Bucharest? - The same... Crowded, huh? I find Bucharest horrifying... I couldn't move back there... You know, I lived there 20 years. From a certain point of View Bucharest is interesting... I used to go to concerts, theatre... My father Worked with the National Theatre... - Really? He was an actor? - In the 60's... it's complicated... But I chose a small town because, after all, what could Bucharest offer me? A dog eat dog world... I'm sure you know... Small town, high prospects. I was lucky I was really lucky Back then, neurosurgery was breaking new ground and I did things I don't think I could've done in Bucharest... - I see... - I was right to leave... And I'm proud of what I accomplished. We can't have everything, of course... Mom's in Petrosani. shes 75... She lives by herself and I can't convince her to come here. Anyway... You Know how old people are... I go visit her whenever I can, but... it's a pity... Well... I'd better be going then... Once again, I'm sorry... I trust you... - Thank you... - I'm glad you're taking care of mom. You can relax... I'm taking good care of your mother. We've known each other for a long time and I owe her for some things... It doesn't matter... Last night I listened to Nana Mouskouri... Gorgeous singer! I'm thinking about bringing some to your mom because its very relaxing. Relaxation is very important... - You know Nana Mouskouri, right? - Yeah... Her voice is out of this World! This one is the nicest of all the nurses... Alex, at the bottom of the drawer there are some chocolate bars. - Take one and give it to her... - I won't do it. Let dad... - Why Alex'?! it's a chocolate! - I don't want to! - Good evening... - Here's your pill... I've been meaning to ask you... What's the pill for? For sleeping. It will help you fall asleep. - And what's in the perfusion? - Same thing as this morning. Vitamins. A small gift... for you... And what are they called? - I'm interested in this stuff... - She could become a pharmacist. Mannitol and Cerebrolizin for the blood circulation... - There are so many... - Yeah, why does she need so many? This is what the doctor prescribed! They're good for her. Probably... They're crucial! If you Want to call somebody or go to bathroom during the night, you can't reach the bell... - If I have to, I can reach it, look... - 'Cause you're not lying down. Are you and your friends going out tonight'? - Yeah, but I'm Waiting for Delia... - Why did she take the trouble?! She didn't, relax... She Wanted to see her folks anyway... it's good to go out. You've been mostly in here. - I'm okay now. - Let's Wait for Susu to see the radiography... - We might have to move you... - I don't want to! If they have to... The truth is, I got used to seeing you here... - Why transfer me?! - C'mon mom... We'll see... If he says you can stay here, you'll stay here. - Everybody's been taking care of her! - You should get some sleep. - Bye... - He's not going to Pakistan, you know... - And ring the bell, okay? Like this... - Don't! - Good night. - Don't joke like that... Pakistan! - Good night... - Good night! He got upset 'cause I told him I'd frame them... He got upset 'cause I told him I'd frame them... I wasn't upset you threw them away, 'cause they were torn and without elastic, but I had them from the Army they were a souvenir. - We were in the Army together... - Yeah, man, I Know those briefs... They had a red A oh each... Delia, why did you throw them away? - See?! - I was Wrong... What time is it? Susu's about to call... I had to move my mom... She doesn't Want to, - I don't get why she likes it here. - Cluj is definitely better. - That's what I said... - I don't believe in these things. My neighbor died in Cluj because of a mistake. I don't know what happened precisely but she Went there with cancer and died 'cause they gave her something and her intestines burst. It can happen anywhere. Well, that guy in France Went to the hospital with his kid suffering from a sore throat and the kid died. Where is safer? In Cluj they are better professionals. If it is meant to happen, it will happen anywhere. - Be it Cluj of Honolulu. - I'd rather go in Honolulu... You should transfer her... If you say so, Alinuta, then that's what I'll do. It might be better to stay here. She has friends, acquaintances... - That's also true... - No, it ain't. Look at Gina. Here, she was told shed be dead in two months. - And she's alive and Kicking. - Gina was told that in Bucharest, too. She went to Vienna, that's why she's alive. The idea is that in such serious situations one should at least go to Timisoara. But hers ain't a serious situation... Is your mother's state serious? I don't think so... Who the hell knows? - See? - Do as you Wish... I'd be more relaxed to know shes been moved. Being relaxed is a completely different matter Unless we're talking about his mothers relaxation. If we're talking about Alex's... That's the difference. - C'mon Curly, give us a break. - Alex! Is your mother okay? - Is she pleased here? - Yes, Curly... Sometimes I can talk to her normally... I mean in general... But she does some freakish stuff, too. For example, she kept asking for some pink pajamas... - What's so Wrong about it? - That's what I told him... its got a stupid print on it, a black cat and Capri pants... A black cat'?! I have one of those, too. It's very cute... You're fancy even when you're asleep, Alinuta... - With her, there're two Kitties... - We get it... it's important to know the Whole context. What context, Vlad?! Forget it... It's just a pajama, are you drunk or somethin? Go home! Let's change the subject... Cheers! I don't know Whig but damn it, during Easter I did some thinking while I was at the church... Why do they say... - Another one, please! - For me, too. Why do they say that Jesus came back to life on the third day according to the Scriptures? - Again with this? - Alex is curious... In Romanian, please. We're in Romania here... She says I'm drunk as if she were a saint! - Who got plastered yesterday huh? - Alinuta... - Go on, Bono... - Right... So, on the third day, he rose from the dead. But he died on Friday, right? And we go to church on Sunday morning... This means 2 days... Why do they keep talking about a third day?! C'mon Cretu! Be serious! Friday, Saturday... and Sunday is the third day - That's not the way one calculates... - These are not hotel days... Anyway... It could be, but it's not fair... We get Mondays off as if it were still Easter... - Tuesdays are off too, right? - Are they? I don't know... - Catholics are free only on Mondays. - So, the Bible stipulates 5 free days. - Why five? - Friday and Saturday are not free. - The fasting period ends on Sunday. - So it's only 3 free days on Easter. - Sunday Monday and Thursday - What's the connection? - Well... He's drunk. - C'mon Curly, I'm not! I mean he died... may God rest his soul... - Jesus! - And there are 5 free days. - That's what I'm Wondering... - Bono, everything will be fine... - Let's drink! - Cheers! He says the aftereffects are so insignificant that there's no use in moving her. - Wonderful! Great! - Cheers! Maybe it's better this Way... That's what mom Wants, too... If Alinuta says so, too... But he says to transfer her to Nuti, 'cause she's the neurologist. I told you she's fine and that you Worry too much... - If she's so fine why is she... - Alex, let her be! Calm down. Everything will be just fine. After such a shock it's normal to repeat herself... Cheers! If you're gonna toast, then look people in the eyes, otherwise you'll suffer Really? I was trying to look at your double, but I couldn't caught his eyes... Jeez, Curly, you and your jokes... - I Wanted the best for you. - I know, hon'... The only thing we still need to do is that MRI in Petrosani. - Already? - Didn't I tell you you're fine? You did. Listen mom... Why wouldn't you talk to me on the phone While I was on the train? - Huh? - On the phone... On the train... - Why wouldn't you talk to me? - Why would I'?! I was scared... - Why were you scared? - I was tired, too... Tell me... it's better than to keep it in yourself. Well... There was more than one reason... I was thinking about when you were little you used to kiss us 'cause you loved to kiss us. Don't you remember? And you used to hold me tight. This is what I was thinking... I was missing you, probably... it's stupid... Go to bed now, it's late. I'm going... - You smell of beer! - Well, I've been drinking beer... Like a broached barrel... Go, hon'... I'm going, mom... - Bye... - Bye... saturday - What do you mean? - I told you how you behave... - How do I behave? - Forget it... - What's the connection with mom'?! - You Kept looking at her! I knew it! Do you really think this is the right time to talk about it? With you, there's never a right time. I Wonder what the others said... What were they to say? I made the same jokes as always... - You could've not called her... - You're really somethin'! She's Bonds girl! What was I s'posed to do? Phone him and tell him not to come with her because my girlfriend is jealous Without reason? Not completely Without reason... You're so nice to her. To me... - To you What? - Don't know... you're cold. And you're the same with your folks. What should We do then? Smooch each other all day long? Don't pretend you don't get it, 'cause you do, and very Well! I don't! Give me an example, so that I can understand... - When did you last buy me flowers? - That's the problem?! Yeah... You see, that's the problem. You're cold to me and to your folks. Stop bringing my folks into this... You're making me angry Do I have to buy you flowers every day so that you feel you're cared for'? Did I say anything about every day? At least once a week... You haven't bought me any in 2 months... -2 months, no snit... - And then, only because I insisted. Okay, fine, you're right - But I still don't see the connection. - You should... - And you're the one getting upset! - Mornin'! Alex... Wait, love... Calm down... Wait... - Hi! it's you! - Hi, ma'am... How are you? Well... I went to the bathroom and I hurt my arm with the perfusion... - How? - Against the wall, I think... But I didn't feel anything. Only later I realized I was bleeding... I don't Wanna even talk about it! I don't Wanna hear it! What if it happened at night? It's exactly what I imagined! And why are you the one cleaning up? Why don't you call a genitor or a nurse? So not only did I make a mess, now I have to bother them, too! - It's their duty! - Please, allow me... Forget it, Delia... I can wipe a little blood, you Know! They were supposed to be careful something like this doesn't happen! Mom, please stop bending, the blood will go to your head. Go to your bed! - You're overreacting... - I'm overreacting? - Give that to me, ma'am... - I can manage, Delia... Whenever I say that it's dangerous for her at night, people laugh at me. And now I'm overreacting! It was bound to happen... Mom, what are you doing?! I'm cleaning myself up, what's all this fuss for? I pricked myself a bit, what's the big deal? You act as if you didn't understand. It's dangerous at night. You can't see a thing, you can't even notice you're bleeding! - It happened this morning! - You act as if you didn't understand! - Are you feelin' alright? - Yeah... Of course! You'd better give me something to eat 'cause I'm hungry... - How are you, Delia? - Fine... - See how he's rebuking me? - I see... Hon', look, the bleeding's stopped! So why all this fuss, then? - Let's see what you brought me. - Some yoghurt and some cheese. My god... I'm in the mood for some meat or pork fat... - I've had it with this food! - Be patient now! You have to eat healthily Have some yoghurt! This cheese was really good. - Is it from the market? - Don't know, dad bought it... Probably... Apparently, cottage cheese is hard to find... - Hello! - Hi! - Mrs. David? - Yeah... You don't know me... My Wife Mimi Works at your school... Mimi! Sure! Of course I know her! - Please forgive me, Mr. Marta... - No, my name's lliescu. She kept her maiden name. She told me what happened and if you need anything, please don't hesitate to tell me. I'm on the 3rd floor, in Orthopedics, but who knows... Thank you very much, but I don't need anything for now. My son is taking care... He's feeding me, see? - He's my son, Alex. - Nice to meet you. - And his girlfriend from Bucharest. - Hi... Ciprian will come by in the afternoon. Do you remember him? - Ciprian Stoica? - Yes. - Don't tell me he's a doctor here... - Yes, he is! He's Working with me. - Bye, then... - Thank you very much, doc. - Elena, hi!

My son already told me. Doc... Do you think we can get that CD with the X-Ray? - Didn't they give it to you? - We don't need it any more... It seems that the radiologist didn't have the time to... Anyway... I scanned it and I sent it to Cluj. - Dr. Crisan gave as a... the X-Ray. - Right... Sorry... Okay... I see they gave you Mannitol and Cerebrolizin. Those are fine! And you're feeling fine, you say... - Yeah, very... Thank you. - If you need anything, tell me. - Thank you! - Do you need anything now? No, doc... And Dr. Crisan is really nice.

You didn't have to bring me all these fruits! - He's my son, Alex. - We've already met... - Oh, I forgot to give you a kiss. - You've brought me too many things! - Don't you remember we've met? - I forgot! You're just tired... What am I gonna do with all these fruits? They'll go bad... I have some here, too... I have some strawberries... - Want some? - No, thanks! I'm allergic to them. What am I gonna do with them?! Mom, we're leaving... You have guests, anyway... We'll be back in about 2 hours. Hon', before you go, please take these cherries to that lady's daughter. - No... I don't Wanna... - Please... She's so cute. - Both her feet are in plaster - I'll take them to her... At least give those flowers to the nurse! Do we really have to, mom?! It would be a pity to just let them wither. I'll take them... Alex doesn't buy me any. Why don't you just smack one another'?! Delia, not those, they're so beautiful! I just got them... I Wanna tell you somethin'. - We really have to transfer her! - We've already talked about it! Yeah, but you don't know what happened this morning. - There was blood everywhere... - What happened? You have no idea what I've been through! Crisan lied to us! He promised us great conditions and look how noisy it is! - But what happened to her? - I'll tell you... - Good morning! How are you? - Fine... You should come by my office to talk about Petrosani... I brought some books to your mom. Hello! - These are my colleagues. - Nice to meet you! - I brought you those books. - Isn't the doc nice?! And some of my music... Pavarotti and Nana Mouskouri. - It's such a hot summer! - Here's your fan, mom... Look, my boy brought me a fan! - How much was it? -100 lei. - So cheap? Where from? - The market. - Hon', what am Ito... - I'm on my way then, bye! - Hello, doc! - Hello. - It's a bit crowded in here... - Yeah, and not only that... I wouldn't Want us to suffocate her... I'm Waiting for you to come by, okay? - Bye... - Diana found me. The school nurse was there and she said it's nothing serious. Diana insisted on calling the ambulance. - If it was up to the nurse... - Good girl Diana... - Thank you! - You don't have too... I don't Want to nag you, but I heard you Wanna take her to Petrosani for a tomography it's better to take her to Timisoara Everything's better there, doctors and everything. Everyone does the same. At first I thought about taking her to Cluj, but... No, Timisoara's better There's no contest, believe me! I do believe you. But tomorrow they'll discharge her... I wouldn't hurry... She should remain in Timisoara, under observation, for at least three days... Everyone does the same and it's serious business! I'll see... Once again, thank you very very much! Think about it... I have to go to Crisan. Wait here, okay? I'll be back in a jiffy... Are you coming, dad? - Where? - To see Crisan. - Crisan, now? - Yeah... - Tell me what happened. - I'll tell you about it... Delia dean come sit with us... I told you you were lucky to have such a boy... Remember when little Alex used to iron his clothes? We talked about this when I told you the perfusion was not fixed properly and you laughed at me. And this morning, mom had blood all over her! You're overreacting. Minor incidents happen all the time... Alex dear, it's not such a big deal... - Don't Alex, dear me... - Sorry... For me it's not a minor incident. It's major! - C'mon, nothing happened! - It's okay... We all do the same when we care about someone... But Alex, anyway, you have to talk to me. Your mom's fine now, thank God, so... it's over! I didn't say anything when you Wanted to transfer her, I almost agreed with you, but now I'm happy shes here... - it's better for her... - Sure! - Everybody come visit! - She's home... it's good for her, now, when she's about to retire... it's got nothing to do with moving her to Cluj! It's got to do with moving her to Mrs. Nuti, because she's the neurologist. And she was recommended to me! - Sorry... By Whom? - My friend in Cluj! - May I know his name? - What for? Enough, child! What's the matter with you?! Of course, Mrs. Nuti is great, who says differently? But I forgot to mention this to you... Her sector is a lot dirtier and here are normal people... Over there, there are some Wacky people, so to speak... - That's true! - Right... And anyway, I studied some neurology and your mother ain't my first patient, you Know... My dad told me about your studies, but I wanna transfer her to Nuti. I got it, you don't have to insist. The best thing would be for her to remain here and Nuti come visit her... If she Wants to check on her, I have nothing against it. On the contrary... We've Worked together before... - Two are better than one! - Like hell they're better, dad! I thought everything will be fine, that we'll do as agreed, but now I see you've changed your mind... But Nuti made a mistake. She should've noted everything down! Maybe she was upset. Perhaps they had ah argument, who Knows? - We should've transferred her! - We had no argument... Do as you please! You didn't care about my opinion anyway... And you Keep my mom on those mega perfusions only for me, so that I can see how nice you are! - Think I'm stupid, or somethin? - Alex! You're exaggerating! Alex what? I'm off to Bucharest. Fuck it! No, there's nothing to talk about with Nuti... No, I'm not upset! Okay, enough! Tonight I'm going back home and that's it. Okay, fine, I'm going... I'm not upset, Delia. Okay bye! Sometimes medicine can have the same effect. - Are you feeling sick, mom? - I'm not sure... - It could be the food?! - What else did you bring? The last perfusion for today and a shot. - She likes tequila, you know... - Sorry? You said Shot. Stop with this nonsense, they don't have time for it! - So, are you feeling sick mom? - I don't know... I feel Weak. - It's the perfusion. - I think it's the food. Why do they put you on so many perfusions? - They said she was fine, no? - It's not a simple perfusion... - it's got medicines, vitamins... - No shit! - Sure! They're good for me, right? - It's only an impression... - I really think it's too much. - It's just glucose... Only to let us Know how nice they are! - You're too off-putting... - I'm not! They Keep her on perfusions and she thinks she's not fine. Anyway, tomorrow she'll be dismissed and it will be over... We'll see about it... They don't know it yet. You should leave now. I'm sleepy. - Did they bring the results of the tests? - No, not yet... Don't they know you need them in Petrosani tomorrow? Of course they Know, thats why they tested me! They might bring them tomorrow morning... I knew it! Yeah, maybe... anyway thank God we'll be out of here! We don't Know yet... I'd better remain here under supervision... - You see I'm not fine... - Do you feel dizzy or What? - Shouldn't I call Crisan? - No, hon'... it's no big deal, but maybe I should remain here for a While... You're fine! You're just taking up a bed! Wait a sec. Let me take your picture... What's got into you? I'm not trimmed up and I'm sick... That's the point: I Wanna photograph you exactly as you are right now... - Say cheese. - No... - Say it! - Cheese... - Alex, take one of us, too. - You're in the mood for pictures now! Move right, into the light... You should take the lady's photo too, she's been so nice... - You're right... - Do you mind? No... - That's nice... - Let me see it! - Have you already been to the bathroom? - No. - But do you Wanna go? - No. - Why? - Because! Promise me that if you'll feel the need overnight you'll ring the bell... - I promise... - I'm serious, mom! Think about it... At night, with the perfusion on, it's dark... Want me to find you bleeding again? You're exaggerating! Go home. - See? What's so hard about it? - You didn't ring the bell, I hope... - I made a joke... - it's really good! - Let's go... - Who rang the bell? No one... It was an accident... - Did anything happen? - No, nothing... Sorry... Alex, you're turning me into the laughing stock... I Wanted to show her it's not that difficult... You can't joke about these things. Don't.. Okay, bye then... - What's up love? - Nothing... - What time is it'? - A quarter to 5. Stop Worrying. Try having some sleep. I'm going to the hospital. I can't sleep anyway... - Alex, calm down... - I'll be right back, love. Half an hour ago, that lady took her to the bathroom. - She's fine. - Great, thanks... I came to see if everything's fine. - Don't Worry we're here. - Okay, thank you. - What is she doing? - Looking out the Window... - Is everything okay? - Yeah... Of course she peed oh herself! I took her to the bathroom and then she Went back to bed. - Are you relaxed now? - Yeah. I'll come straight to bed, I'm beat. She was Wearing those pink pajamas again... - Sorry? - The pink pajamas. - She had it on again. - So What? It's strange to see her with that cat on her chest. Go to sleep... sunday What's up mom? What happened? Have you been crying? No, hon' I Woke up at 7 in order to get ready, and I got the results, they brought them to me. The triglycerides' level is over 700. Not in there! Here... They put it in my file without me Knowing it... That's why they didn't want to show them to me: so I wouldn't Worry. In my first day here it was only 300 and is was still too much. - Shouldn't it be lower now? - It could be the perfusions... With all the stuff they put in there! You barely ate anything... - Then why is it so big? - How should I Know... When Relu's level was 600 and he got scared, the doctors told him to give up drinking and smoking... - And I'm up to 800! - But Relu's fine, isn't he? - It could be a mistake... - Forget it! That's why they hid it from me: because it's serious! It's nothing, really howl I've brought you your clothes... - You've only eaten diet stuff. - It's definitely serious! - All I eat turns into fat. - No it doesn't... If it did, we'd all be dead by now... This could be why I was so sick last night... - But are you sick now? - Not any more, but... - I ain't that good either... - I'm calling Crisan... - Did you bring me the shoes? - Yes. Talk to him. - Relax! - Leave me alone! It's disconnected. - What's up? - It was Haiduc... - What about Crisan? - Still off. - What did he say? - He said shit. He said it's too much. And that we'll talk when we come back. Fucking doctor... C'mon love, relax and try calling Susu again. Hi Susu... Fine... We're going to Petrosani... I looked over the latest test results and the triglycerides' level is very high. Over 800... Regular stuff... How shouldn't I, Susu?! When she checked herself in it was 300. Cottage cheese, yoghurt, tomatoes... The normal one... Oh, really? Really? I should've bought the 0.1% fat version. - Is there such a thing? - Yeah, there is... Danone has it... - Fucking shit! - What did he say? That cheese and yoghurt have fats. And that the sugar in the fruits also turns into fat. Give me that file, please... - A little thingy like that?! - Yeah... And that it can also be the perfusion, 'cause they should've put you I don't know what substance to neutralize the vii... the syn... Who the fuck can understand this writing?! it's like little Worms. It's like they're doing it on purpose so that no one can understand it... Understand What? I mean if something happens to someone, the doctor's are home free. Here... It looks like Arabic! I bought that yoghurt myself, get it? C'mon love, so What? Calm down. Didn't the doctors tell you the food was fine? My point exactly! I should've moved her immediately C'mon Alex, you're overreacting! Why do you keep nagging me with this exaggeration business? That's how things happens: out of nowhere! You go to the hospital with a cold and they give you all kind of crap. And now my mom's triglycerides are the size of China because I gave her yoghurt! - How much do we owe you? - Nothing, please... Rodica helped me a lot and there's really no need to... As you wish... What can I say'?! Thank you, you're very Kind... You're welcome! And really don't worry -800 is a lot but it isn't that much. - Did you hear the doctor?! That it was almost impossible not to happen given her diet. - And that even 800 isn't dangerous. - I can hear her, dad... if it really were bad, she wouldn't be able to stand up and she would definitely not look so good... - Thank you... - That's on the outside... But how can I know what's on the inside? When she had the accident it didn't show either, did it? You Worry too much. Come through here... - Everything will be fine! - Fine and healthy! I talked to Susu again and he says it can't be only the cheese and yoghurt. She's been here for 2 days... Really stop blaming yourself... I mean he says that's a cause, but it can't be the only one... I should've asked more people what she's allowed or not... But Susu told you the same thing. Really now! I gave her that yoghurt with my own hand... Sir! I told you not to put chicken and cheese in the salad. Bring me another one... - Chicken's okay... - Okay then! - It can have chicken, but no cheese. - And a non alcoholic been please! Fine... In an open air pub near the hospital. We're Waiting for the results. They said it will take about 3 hours. There's no hurry... it's so nice outside anyway... Okay... If you say so... Okay kisses, bye... - Who was it'? - Rodica... She said she'll call to hurry them up a bit 'cause it's unacceptable to Wait that long. - You know how Rodica is... Nice. - She is nice! What's so nice about hen mom? Didn't everybody tell you that these tomography analyses take time and that it's important? - Why does she mess about? - I told her... - But she said she'll sort things out... - There's nothing to sort! - Does she know Whats best for you?! - What am I supposed to do? I didn't even have the chance to tell her... God! These guys and their good intentions drive me crazy! They can't mind their fucking business! - They can't possibly be that stupid... - Let's eat... I'm hungry! Alex! - He sometimes behaves just like father! - Like me? - You do exactly the same! - If you drive me crazy... of course! - C'mon love... - I'm fine... Hello, yes... Yeah... Okay... No, I'm coming... 20... Thank you! In about 20 minutes we can go pick up the results. - I knew it! What did I tell you? - What did she say? That it's really bad... That I'm the only one shell tell... - Stop messing around... Tell me! - They didn't find anything! - It's the same diagnosis. - As if you can be sure... They didn't even have time to check the results properly... - Mrs. Nuti will check them... - Of course! And Mr. Crisan too... Why the fuck does she mess about? Why? It's nice outside... We're in no hurry... What does she Want to prove?! - Alex, enough. it's over! - No, it's not over... She was overzealous and we came here for nothing! Enough Alex! You want everybody to do exactly what you say. She only meant to be nice... That's why I wanted to move mom to Cluj! You believe all you hear and you can't say no to anyone. - What do you mean?! - You believe all the morons! Now you're teaching me what to do! And Keep quiet! Everybody's looking at us! I snould've gone back to Bucharest... You know everything anyway... It would've been better! What? Don't you think we can take care of ourselves? And why are you acting so high and mighty? You always talk back to people... - They're my friends... - Enough... Like hell, enough! You gave me that cheese and it wasn't good, see? - Or that you don't see? - Why do you have to fight? C'mon love, what did you get so angry for? Let's go pick up the results... He's edgy... He's feeling really guilty about that cheese and he got scared this morning... - Look! it's Written in pen... - I've noticed, but it's illegible. It says physiological serum". It means they found traces of physiological serum in her blood. So, the tests are useless. - You see? You Worried for nothing. - How was I not to Worry, dad? - You said we'd talk later... - I needed to see it with my own eyes. - You're way too sensitive, Alex! - Is this it'? - He's an only child... - Sorry for yesterday. Exactly as I suspected: no traces! Look here... There's some dots... Here, here and here. See them? They are older. Anyway as we grow older, the brain is affected by the... all kind of factors... It looks like a stroke, but it's got nothing to do with this, so... You can relax. In other Words, with time We all get brain spots! Right! Brain spots... - So can we discharge her? - Sure! Anyway I'll have to keep her under close observation for a couple of months. I'll decide upon her medication together with Nuti, and she must continue to take the Frontin in the morning and in the evening. It's bad to take it in the morning when she's fresh and not sleepy. Right... But, at first, she should take at least half a pill. Yeah... Half in the evening and half in the morning. And, in time, we'll decrease the dose. And she should take the brain pill for about 3 months. Wait a sec... There are no traces... It doesn't hurt, of course... If it doesn't hurt, then it's good! Let's try it for a month and if she's fine, then... Okay, that's good, too. There's no fixed medication for this. Alex dear, we're not having an argument... That's the Way We talk... We've known each other for ever... Your mom's medication is great. Alex, your mom's fine. You can go back to Bucharest Without any Worry One more question... I looked on the internet to see whats the medication in other countries and its the same... except there was another drug. - Dipirimol, I think... - See how cute he is? How could anyone be angry with him?! - He's on the internet. - It's called Dipiridamol. It used to be recommended, but it was proven useless and it was eliminated from the medication... - it's an older drug... - I see... I didn't check that... That's what I had to deal with every day! - We all do the same, no? - And he's an only child, too... - We all do the same, no? - And he's an only child, too... You're not upset I'm not seeing you off at the station, right? That's really something! I have no luggage and dad's seeing me off! What time will you get the results tomorrow? - Round 12. - And you'll call me, right? - Is this tuica enough? - That bag is ugly... - This is mine... - No, it's not. - Okay, it's his... I'm ready. - Go get your shoes then. I'm off... Thanks for coming. And I didn't mean to upset you... I mean... to say what I said... I got angry... No, it's me who overreacted I'm sorry. C'mon, we'll miss the train. Keep your Skype open so that I can hear what happens. And call me tomorrow to tell me about the tests. Okay... C'mon, it's not like we're leaving for Pakistan! I'm sorry mom. I didn't mean to hurt you. Eh, how would you hurt me'?! And it's not the first time we had a fight, but sometimes you act all hysterical. But I'm not upset... - Bye... - So, you ARE leaving for Pakistan... Listen... don't get angry if mom forgets things, Listen... don't get angry if mom forgets things, 'cause that's the way it is... And tell her to call me tomorrow when she has the results. And buy her those low fat yoghurts. And some flowers... Anything else? What time does it reach Bucharest? Round 6:30, unless there are delays... Okay then... God, you've turned grey! You'll catch up with me in no time... Bye; it's very hard to notice. Especially with the train moving... - What? - For all we know she could be dead... Can't you think of something nicer? Whenever I Went to see my mom at night in the hospital I'd check to see if she was still breathing, if the blanket was moving over her chest. It's hard to notice... Love, I'm gonna catch some sleep 'cause I'm beat. Okay, sleep then... - Did I Wake you up love? - Nope... - What time is it? -5... - I'm going back to sleep... - Okay... So... it was the yoghurt and cheese you bought at the supermarket? Right! That yoghurt, as normal as it may seem, it ain't that normal a&er all... it's fat! And if, God forbid, something had happened to my mom, it would've been because of all the fat in her blood. - And I gave her that cheese myself. - Wow! Monday We ran out of Espresso. I made some Jacobs, okay? My parents had some... They were supposed to call by now... They will call... They might not be ready yet. You Know how it works... Yeah, they could've called to tell me that. They know I'm Waiting... The phone could be on silent and they don't know it... - Try on Skype. - I already did... - What time are you leaving? - Round 2... Did you see that stain in the bathroom? it's back... I did, fucking morons! I told them it's from under the bathtub. Take this one, it's sugar free. Relax, they'll call, don't Worry Who is it? Dad. Why aren't you answering? I'm scared it's bad news... So... you won't answer then?! I can't... - Should I? - No, I'll call him later. Why? What if they made a mistake in Petrosani? - What if... - Can I see the caller's ID? No, Delia, forget it! Go to the bathroom, I'll call him later. Why? I'm scared... - Why are you scared? - I don't know... - 'Cause it's bad news. - Enough with this nonsense! Let's see who called... Hi! Right... That's great, right? I mean, it ain't that big, right? Right, from time to time a diet doesn't hurt. Yeah... I'll put him through... Or... He could call you later... That sounds good... Perfect! Great. Bye, kisses. She's fine... Why are you so scared, huh? She'll call you in 5 minutes. She was with your father... Your mom's fine, love... Really fine! Shall I Wash them? Wait... I'm afraid he's calling and it's bad news. That my mom... you get it... - But she's fine now. - Yeah, Delia... But it could be a phone call similar to my dad's... Okay... But it isn't. And it ain't bad news... Not now... But one day there will be, right? - I should be going... - I know...
