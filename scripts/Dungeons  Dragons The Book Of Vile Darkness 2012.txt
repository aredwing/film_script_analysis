Consumed by hatred to all living things ... Nhagruul sold his soul the demonic Lords of the Abyss ... so your spirit Malignant survive ... after the end of the body. In an excruciating ritual ... the skin was abraded Nhagruul to serve as leaves ... his bones were shaped to serve as a cover ... and blood malignant transformed into ink ... to write the book vilest of all. Those exposed to the book To the madness were taken. Or became so corrupted dangerous content by its ... I do not have a choice, but to become malignant. The misery and bloodshed followed the disciples Nhagruul ... specially tailor who spread the dream obscure their master. Creatures vile and depraved ... emerged from every corner alleys and dirty ... to join To the agitation of destruction. The cities and kingdoms of Karkoth were devoured ... by this evil plague ... to arise from the ashes an order of warriors. They were called Knights of the New Sun .. and took the oath of resuscitating Hope lands. The purity in their hearts was so great that Pelor, the God of Light .. awarded to riders powerful amulets ... with which could channel its power of fair. Bathed in divine light Knights of the New Sun .. penetrated in the shade that obscures the land ... in the last 1200 years, and drove them on. But not everyone was dazzled by its splendor. The disciples of Nhagruul dismantled the book ... and bribed three greedy souls to conceal parts ... until they could be recovered. The ink was discovered and destroyed, but ... despite several years of searching ... the cover and pages were never found. Peace reigned in the land for many centuries ... and the Knights lost in light of his own glory. To the extent that memory Nhagruul of disappeared ... also happened the same the power of the servants of Pelor. The Knights of the New Sun left to themselves ... in reckless belief that The Book of Vile Darkness ... more never be restored.

You forward a portal of magnitude ... and do this to their guardians no reason to enter. You know what we're looking for? Only care with the reward. And do not spend it foolishly. The reward is and 1/12 of treasure we collect along the way. - I only see six. - And only see half man. I'm more than enough for you. - Sorry. - We're waiting. I'll take that. Everyone agrees with 1/5? Are the bloodshed on my map. Yes, Lord Shathrax, 're on our way. Five people. - Do not even think about it. - Think about what? Women of Shadar-Kai believe that the best way, reaching the heart of a man ... It's in the back. I'm not interested in her heart. I'll write that on your tombstone. It can be difficult with only one hand. I'm fine with both hands ... and recordings. - Want me to show you? - Leave him alone. Dragon! I expected to find the sleeping dragon. What we look for is in his cave. Let's give him time to feed. I saw five prisoners. In my experience, a dragon that size ... an accurate time to consume a human being. - Five hours, then. - Four hours. - What? - One of the prisoners was a child. Okay, four and a half hours. The dragon will sleep after gorging. No! Why do not we attack now before they eat and regain your strength? Shall speak only when you are consulted. Standing boy. You can not for the world burning lying. Bezz, take a look. See if the dragon is sleeping. Corpse. Another corpse. The dragon sleeps. What is happening? Clatha! Says "clatha"! Clatha! - Where is the boy? - Under what. He ensured our victory with your life. A bargain, as there are few. Sometimes it's best remain silent ... and cause people think we are idiots. And open it only when to remove any doubt. Are you making fun of me? Yes. Speaking when consulted my ass! Slayer of dragons! This may be useful. - That's it? - Everything of value. What a miserable excuse for a dragon. So was defeated so easily. - See if you're trapped. - Back.

Only the weak, cowardly others to kill for what they want, This summer time as something cruel. We one third Karkoth's return to power. Foreordained by themselves laws that gave us life ... and took care of all existence. What's this? One of the prisoners of the dragon. There are three more upstairs. Must have them put to sleep before battle. - Vimak help me. - Vimak, receive my orders ... not his. Never said anything about slaves or human sacrifice. - I think I want to free them. - Good boy, was listening to us. - Freeing them? - The Celestial Wheel says ... whoever asks mercy, deserves death. Your intention is to free least the lower ... their mediocre lives? If so, please ... - Let me help you with the ritual. - No, no ritual! If we take the bastards back to Little Silver alive ... to treat us like heroes. Yes. Give us what we want to. I think a great idea. Can be generous. Vimak. Help him with the rest prisoners. Do not hurt a hair their precious heads. Seith. Open up! We killed the dragon. We need food, water and shelter. Do you want badly. We save three of your citizens from certain death. Delgar! - Is that you? - It's me! They rescued us. I think this belongs to you. Open the gates! The dragon is dead! Are you feeling well with yourself, is not it? Killing a dragon has this effect. I cut this tail it for you. Only the most powerful killers earn the right to use such trophy. Come on. Take. - Have you catches a raccoon? - No. Put an apple in a box ... and makes a hole in the side. The raccoon grabs the apple ... but he can not take his paw, because the hole is too small. Buster is so happy to have found the apple ... I do not want to release it. When you see the stone in its direction to crush her skull ... is too late. Slayer of dragons. It is possible that these people enjoy the simplicity of their lives? No. The only meaning of their lives ... is providing me a place where to bury my gun. Only then will feel complete. Ver Riyo is the wife of the tanner? - Yes - My condolences for your loss. He certainly would to stay with it. - Thank you. - Is the daddy! Will take care of your mother. You're the man of the house now. Mom? Get out! Stay away from me! Dance with me. Here. Hold me so. It's not so bad, is it? Come home me tonight. All the others are so boring. Farmers and blacksmiths. I took an oath to my father. He'll never know. I can not. - I'm not who you think I am. - You are, yes. Let's get this over with. The strong prey on the weak without pity or remorse. Strong. Weak. Do not move. The device is ready ... pain to extract liquid, Lord Shathrax. Father! You saved my life. By the law of Shadar-Kai, you have a right to my body. You can delight you as they see fit. Want me to bed? - No. - Okay. Commands me. Arise. Dress up your outfits. My clothes? - Are you kidding me? - I do not know what you want. Escaped the Pyramid of Shadows. Faar, King of Trohold, sighed for the last time on my face ... with my knife in his bowels. My knife. You think I'll tolerate rejection a human boy? You told me I could delight me how well it is understood. Prefer delight me of your pride. My wish is to see you humiliated. No. I can see in your eyes. Want more than my humiliation. Your heart beats more Accelerated than a rabbit. Want to, but not doses. Why? What are you hiding? I do not trust you. I think travel to the fortress of Shathrax without you. Goodbye. No. You like courting death. I like that. It makes life worth living, is not it? We met at the gate. Vimak. It's locked. The outside. Everybody stay calm. Open the gates! The gates? I would open, but our keeper had his throat cut. Like other six. Just a sample of what's coming then if you do not open the gates! Let's finish what the dragon began ... and take down these walls on top of your heads. None of you will be spared. - Think of your children. - They killed our men. And now you expect me to let you leave here with our treasure? See how payment the death of the dragon. So die fighting, rather than starve ... for thus will die with us! Aim at Shadar-Kai Witch! Kill her before the others! Open the gates or blow up the collar ... and sponges need to clear his remains! Then I shall know my Creator shameless in his heart. Men, when I say 5, attack. - 3! - Half! We will refund half the treasure ... open the gates. The next words that talk gonna be your last. I'd rather you split half than not having anything! - They killed the dragon! - Give half! We've had too many problems. It seems that our allies spoke for us. I did not think he had one. Well .. the reason prevailed. Take half the treasure. And follow at peace. Clatha! Delgar! - I'm not who you think. - Who are you? Hey. They need to stay silent. I'm here to help, yes? There should be an exit ahead. Then we ran to the forest, okay? What is your creature Forest favorite? Zombies. Zombies? It's not what we want to see. I told them that the zombies 're bad, but I do not hear. Your sister is right. And the unicorns? - Unicorn is a girl thing. - They can help us. When we reach the forest I want you to stay tuned. Let me know if you see one. They can do this for me? Akordia, let's go. - Where is Grayson? Did you see him? - No. We need to get out of here ... before the walls come hell. - Go thou. - He must be dead. I'll catch you later. You'll throw your life away by a boy! A human boy? Not very legendary. If you say a word this to someone ... assarei and your bones. So you're talking! It was your doing. There will be a reckoning! If such a thing were to happen to me, it would have happened a long time ago. Anyone stupid enough ... to offer your life to a god that does not give you value ... deserves what he got. Thank Pelor. He opened my eyes. Time to split the treasure. In total there are 60 000 gold and stones. Nearly 12 thousand for each. More than reward. More than enough for me. For you. A vorpal weapon. The idea of ??returning Little Silver was yours. Come on. Take. See how. And Shathrax? I'll sell the horn for the killer ... for his share of the treasure. They can continue with it, if they want. Drink of my blood the rite of fidelity. And you can be my servant. Or you can go home with me to the city of Gloomwrought. Let terrify them awhile. Adventure, Battle ... glory beyond your imagination. Share the treasure the morning. You do not have to decide now. Let me convince you. Do not leave me. My son. I can not sleep. Can not you sleep? You got the gold. You got the girl. Grayson, you must learn to enjoy life ... with the same impulsivity that you risk. How will you spend your part? When I was little ... our village was hit by an avalanche. My family died. I was hurt. The boss banned me. He said that my family was poor. Since then, I just have a dream ... see their heads burning over a campfire. Not because they were wrong, but because they were right. Those who are too weak to overcome ... - Deserve their low position. - Has it ever been different? The lions are attacking each other. An avalanche much less pious than the first ... is approaching my village. Avenge the shame of my family killing all who remember her. So, with my gold build another village. It's a good dream. When Chief Vimak. When Chief Vimak. Poison! Root thistle! Killer. A Goliath of two meters disappears with 60 000 gold ... and nobody saw or heard anything! - No footprints, no! - We still have the horn. Why not continue with the task ... and collect the reward with Shathrax? Shathrax? I'm tired of hearing his name on your lips. Why are you so desperate to see him? This worked very well for you, right? The horn is mine. We had an agreement. Agreement? Give me your share of the treasure and you can have the horn. What? No treasure? So no deal. Give me the horn. If you want to join me, you kneeling in submission. And part of the rite of fidelity. Or what? - I'll kill him! - Go ahead. Never kneel before thee. As you wish. He was lying. I would not kill him. Tell her, I heal. She'll hear you! I implore you. Pity! No. Back to the original plan. Will complete the task and find Shathrax. The ruins are in elevation. "Only the darkness can see your soul. " Nhagruul. What the hell is that? A child undead betrayed in life by his guardian. I am hungry. I am hungry. What does she eat? Vive energy negative that created it. Malice, fear, kindness and compassion are deadly poisons for her. My tummy hurts. Give me food and I will give you a prize. We must prove that our hearts are free of decency. Bezz. You first. Delight yourself. Is not she cute? Okay, Bezz. Enough. Enough! More! More! Grayson. Grayson, vai. Grayson. Make or cut your hand and do in your place. You did bad things. You did? I heard you did, Vimak when killed. Love! Love! Love! It hurts! It hurts! Father, kill them! Are wound. - Was I? - Yes Too bad it will not scar. We have to cover. Yes. We are ready. Yes, Lord Shathrax. Of Little Silver. Red. Grayson. You were key events Karkoth that will change forever. Your gonna be legendary acts. Your name will survive while the earth exists ... where the freaks gonna be governed and the healthy, devoured. Welcome Shadowfell. Cede to your secrets darker ... without fear of reprisal or trial. The ceremony of the construction site begin at midnight. Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! - Grayson. - Yes Me. I'm here. - My son. - My son? Shathrax asked me to see the prisoner ... and against this mouse calling you a son! Grayson, like this abomination of Shadar-Kai knows you? What I know about it would make you roll in the hole, man. Akordia. I can explain. What did you do? - What happened to my son? - Come on, Dad. We need to go. I'm not going anywhere until you wilt tell me. Betray all oaths. Murdered and denied mercy to the enemy. I saw horrible things, Dad. So I will not hesitate to drag him away, if necessary! Judge me if you want, but will not let you save it. I'm going with you ... but not because I ordered as a slave. Through the window. Father, vai! Through the window! Grayson, you have to destroy me. Shathrax is gathering The Book of Vile Darkness. He regained the pages ... and want to extract liquid pain in my body ... for use as ink. - When you get the cover ... - They ... already got the cover. They have? Grayson. No. It was the only way to save him. Save me? At what cost? Quick, pull down the door! He said he has sinned, who committed terrible crimes. What is one more? What about keeping the light of hope? This light has faded you, Grayson. Think of the pain. For me. To all people of Karkoth. If we do not kill me ... I'll do it myself, if needed. Do it, now! Before it's too late! Every sinful act I committed on behalf of a greater good ... I only approached this time ... where necessary to destroy what I love most. I became a beast. No better than the they're behind that door. No, Dad. I will not kill him. Let's fight. Fight me! Until death, if necessary. Even if we captured and the book created ... while the light shines in the darkness, they never come out victorious. Come, then, if they are able. Grayson'm Azriel! Dragon slayer and merciless! See! Father It is the man who gives power the amulet. Do the opposite. Your son was worth hundred men like you. I tried to warn you, but did not hear me. Mine is the only option to survive in this world. It would have been a better parent for you than this useless idiot. Get ready for the extraction. During all this time. It was that he wanted. The first true Knight of the New Sun in 800 years. Your net is used for pain draft the new Book of Vile Darkness. You used me from the start. You lied. You risk my life to bring him ... - Until now. - Correct. Take comfort ... knowing that there would be no punishment it infligisses ... pain greater than that awaits him. Today we will The Age of Darkness. But some call darkness ... call ascension of power. The gutters gonna be bathed red with blood ... those too cowardly to defend themselves. Someone will stop him! Even if it takes a thousand years! A new order will emerge. Excellent. Even now I believe that all its decisions ... led to my purpose. Extract liquid pain before the truth is put in place ... and the purity of your heart is dominated by despair. I announce, there is darkness. More ink. My boy. Come with me to Gloomwrought, Grayson. We shall swallow our victory over Shathrax. That choke with our legend. Then what? More thereof. A life that is worth living. I can not. I need to fulfill my duties Knight of the New Sun What boredom. Maybe. And if our paths intersect again ... tempt to kill me? In self-defense. Do not promise anything. Goodbye.
