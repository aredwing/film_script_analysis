BUT SOME DEFY DANGER AND SET OUT ON A JOURNEY, IN HOPE OF A BETTER LIFE. Good. Signe? Do you wanna try? You aim along the... You aim along the arrow. Nice. You're just a bit... Impatient. Food is ready! Tormod? Look at this. What's going on? Just some stones... Stay here! No, don't look! I'll take care of you. Weren't there two? Just kids. Help! Run! Run, Tormod! - Boy! - I got him. No! You got her father. She's mine. Wait. Take her. Something to warm up with. Careful. Frigg? Hello! - Have you been good? - Yes. Wanna see what I brought you? Let's see. Why is she here? Here. Look at that! Nice? Now, you were lucky. You can have... The horse is yours. Frigg? What's your name? What's your name? Don't be afraid of them. They won't dare touch you... as long as I forbid them. I'm thirsty. You're not like them. Frigg? What are you doing? Every time she tries something, you cut off a finger. But this time, just slap her. Good. You, come here. She deserved it, right? Come. Go to bed. I can't have children anymore, and Frigg wants to have a sister. A little sister. There's one thing you must understand. Frigg means everything to us. The brat and the witch can burn in hell! Don't feel sorry for her. Frigg, look at me. She wants to harm us. There are people, people like her, who chased us out into the forest. Don't talk to her. I'm not a child anymore, Dagmar. You know that you can tell mom, right? Quiet, or I cut your throat. Not a sound! I was the one who found her. Dagmar said no. We do everything for her. She's our reward. You must remember one thing... Do you hear what I said? Do you hear what I said? Dagmar? Wait a minute. It's enough. I said that's enough! You're getting old, Arvid. I said that it's enough. Are you deaf? You... What did I say about this? Witch! I missed your little brother's heart. He probably spent hours bleeding to death. Maybe he's still screaming for help! I just can't wait until tomorrow. I'll let the boys have you, one by one. That's what I wanted to say. You know what you have to do when the sun rises? Say it. I'll cut off her finger. Yes. Good. Go. Stop! Come! Arvid? She runs away! Frigg? Frigg! Come on! Come. They're not here! Frigg! Frigg! We ran past them. Search through the forest. Find them. Here! At the ravine! Help me! I got her. Wait! Frigg, stay there! I'll get you. Frigg? We cross further down. Come. They're going to catch us. We must get away from the trail. Come. We spread ourselves. Then we meet here. What do we do with them? Bring Frigg here. And the other girl? Do whatever you want. We won't find another one. You still haven't thanked me for setting you free. I don't know how to survive here. If you want to live, you'd better turn around. They can take much better care of you. I can take care of myself. The girl probably threatened Frigg to follow. We'll just find her and take her home. Where is Loki? Take my hand. That's it. Hurry! Come! Calm down. You'll be mine anyway. It'll be fine. Drop it! Or I'll cut your throat. Let's see. I should have killed her in the ravine. They can be anywhere. Want to see Frigg again? I just want Frigg to be all right. If you were on the run, what would you do? I would follow the valley. Along the river. And try to find people. What if there's someone there. Only dead people. Yes. Where are your parents? The real ones. Dagmar told me I was alone when they found me. The Black Death had taken my mother and father. Only I survived on the farm. Do you remember anything? You said you'd take care of me. What are you doing here? Answer! We wanted to warm up. We'll leave now. Stop! You can never be too careful up here. I saw the smoke from the house... I thought it was robbers. Are you hungry? We went down into the valley. Then we found the farm... And decided to rest here until tomorrow. I'm sorry to hear about your family. How many men were there? Five men. But a woman was their leader. Dagmar. Dagmar? Do you know who she is? Everyone around here knows her. When the Black Death came to the valley, people thought it was Dagmar's making. They thought Dagmar had cast a curse on the village. She and her daughter were subjected to the water test. She had a child? Yes. Five years old. You could say that they took it away from her. After the girl had drowned, it was her turn. But when they would pull up, the body was gone. They looked for her at the bottom of the river, but found nothing. What are you doing? Taking care of the weapon. What is it for? Bear. How? You wanna know? Yes. First, you get the bear to run after you... Then you lie down and wait. Let him come very close... And bring up the spear, aiming at its chest, and... Signe? Signe? There's a village two days' walk from here. I'll follow you. I have to bury my brother. It's not safe now. I'll find someone in the village who can go with you. Do you know someone who can take care of Frigg? Yes. You. Me? No. I can barely take care of myself. You got her away from them. Maybe you can do more than you think? Frigg? Frigg, where are you? Frigg! Frigg... What is it? Did you think we had left you? No. Who's he? Who cares. We kill him and the girl. Frigg gets her punishment in the camp. - Are you ready? - Yes. Ready. Yes, I'm ready. Watch! Stop! Back! Drop the knife! Get them all out in the yard. Get them out! All out in the yard. Now! Come out! - Get ready to run. - Let him go! Let Frigg go, and we'll leave. Put down your weapons. Frigg? Come out, or I'll kill you! Come! I know the injustice that was done towards you and the child. But these girls are innocent. Just as you and your girl were. Dagmar... We let Frigg go. We can let Frigg go. No! Out the back door! - Hurry up. - We're not leaving without you. Do it now! Come! Around the house! Come, Frigg. I'll jump! No. I know I've done so many terrible things. But I promise to change. Everything should be fine now. We'll start over, just me and you. Will you let Signe to go? Of course. Never forget who you are, Frigg. No! What are you carving? Here. Along the arrow. - You've been in the river before. - You too. Die! Mom! What did you say? Mom. My girl... Come. I couldn't take care of him. A rune? "Odal." What does it mean? Family.
