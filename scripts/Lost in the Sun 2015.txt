Nobody else's. Mine. When you get older, all those mistakes start piling up inside you. Regrets, blame. It's enough to make you sick to your stomach. Problem is, there are certain things that I just can't change about myself. Fill it up, will you? - Morning. - Good morning. $20 on eight, please? Where are your cards? Cards... Backside of this aisle right here. He almost finished out there? Yeah, almost. 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Hello? What's the address of your emergency? That'll be it. Okay, $20 on the pump, $24. $24. That's a steal. You have a good day. BOY- You're the one from the paper. I think you got me confused with somebody else, all right? No. I know who you are. I know who he is too. The truth, sir... I assume you're a friend. I'm sorry. A friend of the family? Yeah. I'm sorry for your loss. What's gonna happen with the boy? He's going to his grandparents' place. Where were they? They live in Farmington, New Mexico. But I hear his grandfather's gravely ill. You driving him? Oh, no. I'm just gonna chauffer him over to the bus station. Do you know Louis? No. Thank the Lord, he's got his grandparents. Yeah. All right, son. You ready? Yes, sir. Let me help you. Right over here. All right, son. So all right. Here we go. Now I've got your ticket. Your money's in the envelope. They're gonna put your skis and bags underneath. I hate buses. Can't you just drive me? Aw, son, I'm needed here. But you'll be fine. Nothing to worry about, okay? It's uh... It was nice meeting you. You too, Louis. I'll be praying for you, son. Hey, Louis. I'm John. Yeah, you were at the church. That's right, that's right. Nice to meet you. Listen, I'm sorry about your mother. It's a shame. Listen, I just got a phone call from your grandparents. Apparently, they don't love the idea of you riding on this bus for three days. They asked me if I'd give you a lift. Meanwhile, I was headed that way so I told them, shit, why not? Sir, I don't know you. Yeah, well, I don't really know you either and, frankly, this is a pain in my ass. But, like I said, I know your grandparents and your mother was a... She was a good woman. You knew my mom? Yeah. She never really talked about you. Yeah? Well, I guess I didn't make much of an impression then, did I? We kept in touch. I'd call, she'd call. - You know how it goes. - Yeah. Listen, I got to hit the road. I understand if you don't want to come with me. Besides, buses ain't so bad. Perfectly civilized mode of transportation, if you ask me. But, hey, good luck to you, kid, and my deepest condolences to you and your family, all right? Kid, you getting on the bus? I gotta go. Sir. Sir? Get in. You, uh... You live in this car or something? No, of course not. I just wasn't expecting guests. Your mother was a wonderful woman. Classy lady, fun gal. Full of spirit. She was... Sparky. - Oh... - She was... I forgot. What do you got there? Pictures. Ah. This is my grandparents' house. Oh, yeah, yeah. Good, that's good. You know, the only time I really visited them was when I was little. Mom didn't get along with my grandparents too well. Didn't really talk. Hey, how long do you think it'll take? I don't know. What? Nothing. Hey, I got to make a couple quick calls. Should just take me a couple minutes. - Moody residence. - Mrs. Moody? John Wheeler here. How you doing? You have got some nerve calling here. I was just at your daughter's wake. Where were you? Earl's sick. Now what do you want? I got Louis, her boy. What... why would you have Louis? Now, look, there's been a change of plans. I'm gonna drive him home. Where's that priest? Put Louis on the phone. It'll just take a couple of days. You got nothing to worry about. Now you put Louis back on that bus and get back... One more stop. Stay here. Hey, I need that to get home! What's up, John? Will you excuse us for a moment, please? Okay, thanks. This is a fucking joke, right'? There's a little over 6,000 bucks right there. You're short $14,000 and change. Maybe more. Well, what are you... you said $10,000. I owe you $10,000. You're late, John, again. So it's $20. What are you doing, huh? How long have we known each other? Long enough for you to know better. This is fucking bullshit, John! Do you understand? What the fuck do you want from me? John, protection in jail is very expensive. Do you understand that? I didn't ask you for any goddamned protection. Yeah, but you took it. You know jail could have been dangerous for you, John. I'm living out of my car. I don't have anything else. I just gave you everything that I got, okay? Boy, do you want to go back to jail? You like the bed and the three meals of crap they serve you every day? 'Cause I can arrange that with just one fucking phone call. Freddy, give me the fucking phone. No, no, no, no. You're not gonna make any phone calls. I got just as much shit on you as you got on me. 6,000 bucks. That's all you get. We're closed! We're closed! Goddamn kid. Hey, are you in some kind of trouble? It's nothing. Did they do that to you? I don't know what I was thinking. You ain't worth the trouble. The closest I could get you is Albuquerque. I'll call your grandma and have her pick you up in a couple of days. Good to meet you. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Louis! Louis! Louis? Louis. Hey. Hey, I'm talking to you. I don't want to be alone. Why did she have to die? There's no good reason. I don't know, man. I don't have anyone else. Hey, you're gonna be all right. Hey! Hey! Hey, let's get something to eat. I'm hungry- What's with these skis? For skiing. Yeah, well, there ain't no snow around here. The skis were a gift from my mom. You probably never even skied before. She wanted me to learn. Skiing's expensive. I just saved you a shitload of money. It was the last thing she gave me before she died. Yeah, it's a dumb sport. I can't believe all you got was $20 bucks and that stupid ring! Are you hungry? I'm starving. Let's go. Mm, mm. Good. What, you're not gonna eat? I'm not hungry. Fine with me. Starve. Look at that little piece of ass. Hey, you like women? Yeah, I guess. You guess? All right, well, know this. A scorned woman will tear your heart out, put it between two buns and eat it just as your life slips away before you. Don't ever forget that. Hey, you wanna drive? Yeah? You wanna drive? All right, can you see over the hood? I guess. All right. Your feet touch the pedals? I think so. You think so or you can? It's kind of a big deal. - Yeah, fine. - Okay, all right. So this is an automatic. So all you gotta do is pull that lever down from P to D. There you go. All right, now take your foot off the brake. Push down on the gas. There you go. All you gotta do is avoid other cars and that's pretty much it. How fast you going? Uh, 32 mph. No, no, no. You gotta get it up. At least 50 or 60, even 70. There you go. See, faster is way better, isn't it? You're blind! Oh! Oh! All right, the first rule to gun fighting is having a gun. All right, I prefer to have something small. Something easier to carry. Easier to conceal, all right? Can't go hunting with something like this, though. Why not? You just can't. It ain't right. What's the point, then? The point is, if I have the gun... I have the control, right? You want to give it a shot? If I let you shoot this, you owe me a favor. Okay. All right. Go ahead. Go ahead, shoot it again. All right. Turn it, gangster style. There you go. Let's go. Hey, give me my gun. Wake up. Wake up. It's time for that favor. All right, now keep the engine running. Don't turn it off for any reason, you understand? Where you going? I gotta run inside and grab a couple of things. Just keep it running. I'll be right back. Now jump in the driver's seat. Wait, what? - Howdy. - Howdy. Let me know if I can help you with anything. We got some specials back there. Are you gonna get it? Yeah, that should... oh, the newspaper. Get on the ground. Get on the fucking ground! - Get on the goddamned... - I heard you! - I'll beat you with this fucking gun! - I heard you, damn it! Listen, this store's all I got. You leave me something you hear? There you go. You're a real son of a bitch. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Hey, hey! Get out of the fucking car! Get out... Hands off the boy! Easy, easy! Go! Ha! All right! Now keep it up over 70. Keep it on the right side of the road. - Just like I told you. - I'm gonna be sick. What do you mean, you feel sick? - I'm sick, I'm sick. - What are you doing? Hey! Hey! Get in the back! Get in the back! GO, go, go, go! Oh, shit! God damn it! Son of a bitch! - I need some air. - Yeah, well, shut up! I need air. - I need some air! - What are you doing? Shut that door! No! No! God damn it! God damn it! Stay here. Where you going? Get your things. - Where'd you get that car? - Shut up and get in! Did you steal it? I will leave you here. I swear to God, I will! You cost me a lot of money today. I don't want anything to do with you. Well, that's not an option, is it? You can't make me stay. I can leave. Just hitchhike. Yeah, okay. You're gonna hitchhike? Yeah. Why don't we find a place to sleep tonight? With a bed? Yeah, sure. Why not? Fine. You awake? What? Just wanted to see if you were awake. Why'd you do it? Do what? Rob that place. Because we didn't have any money and we needed it. To get me home? Yeah, to get you home. Food and gas. This bed. Why do you live in your car? Because I can't afford anything else. Most adults have jobs... Just go to bed, Louis. Just go the fuck to bed, please. All right. When you're done in there, I want you to pull the truck around. Understand? Hey, you paying attention to me? Yeah. I heard you. God damn it, you pay attention! Wake up! You're not gonna go fucking this up for me again. All right, Louis. Stop fucking around and open up the door. A couple of days. That's how long you said it would take. You're a liar. Open up the door. Come on! The fucking... Open up the fucking door! God damn it! Okay. Now take your hands off the wheel and get out of the car. Just one more day and I'll take you to your grandparent's, all right'? Now come on. Open it up, please. You need me. Hello. How's your day? Oh, just going great. Good-looking boy you got there. Yeah, yeah, he is adorable, isn't he? Got a daughter myself. Huh. I'll take $20 on two, please. No gas. Pump's broke. Been broke for months. Oh, shit, all right. Would you grab me a can of that Black Bear Longcut Wintergreen? You don't want any trouble now, do you? - Open it up. - Yeah. Ain't much in there. Well, that'll do. Boy, what are you doing? Come on! This ain't no fucking library! Hurry up! Quit pissing around! Now get back there and clean that up. Come on. Come on. In and out just like a couple of ghosts. Gimme that. Thank you, sir. You got a safe? Christ! GO, go, go, go! Fuck you! God damn it! God damn it, I can't believe that. Shit. I'll tell you what, boy. Life can be such a bore sometimes. But this... This is great. Well, don't look at me like that. You and me make a really, really good team. Shit, they probably got nicknames for us already. Who? The papers? Yeah. Don't they have better things to do? Shit, no. Bonnie and Clyde was all over the newspapers. Billy the Kid, too. He was famous. Like in movies? - Exactly. - Mm-hmm. You know, in the movies, they all got shot to death. Aren't you having fun? If I was your age, I'd be having fun. No, I'm not having fun. You think this is easy for me? Dragging your skinny little ass all over the place? This ain't no fucking holiday, all right? This is a job. This is work driving you home. You know, it'll all be over soon enough, all right? Yeah, I hope so. Did you, uh... Did you see that shotgun under the counter earlier today? No. No? I just figured you might have seen it underneath there when you were, you know, down below... I didn't see any gun. Okay. Ma. Do you have chocolate ice cream? I'll have to check in the freezer. Okay. Well, We'd like one scoop. Two spoons for me and the boy, please. One scoop and two spoons. Two spoons. That's right. Okay. Let's go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ice cream. We're leaving. Come on. - We have plenty of money. - We gotta keep moving. I'm not even done eating yet. Yes, you are. Let's go. Get out here! God damn it. Here we go, honey. One scoop and two spoons. I love chocolate. Thank you. Oh, he just needed some fresh air. Uh, he'll be back, right? - Yes. - Okay. I can share if you want some. Honey, I don't need the calories. You enjoy that chocolate ice cream. Let me know if I can do something for you. Thank you. That'll be $14.50. Thank you. You're welcome, sweetie. I'll tell you what. You tell his mama that she raised a gem of a boy. Yeah, I'll be sure to tell her that. We gotta get rid of that truck. I like that truck. Yeah, well, it's not safe to drive anymore. Come on, let's go. Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Come on, lady! I got a kid here! Jesus Christ. We should have kept the truck. Yeah, well... Hey! Just keep walking. Just keep walking. Shit! Keep your mouth shut. Neither one of us want to go to jail, right? Hello, Officer! Hitchhiking is illegal. Particularly on Sunday. Yeah, our car broke down. Uh-huh. Let me see some ID. Come on. Turn around, over there. Spread your legs. Come on. Where you headed? Uh, his grandparents' place. I'm real sorry about this, officer. It's just that, you know, we didn't have much of a choice. Our truck broke down back there, so... Well, now is it a car or is it a truck? He meant car. You better both come with me. We'll clear this up down at the station. Come on. Uh, sir? We're just on our way to church. What was that? We're going to church to pray for my mom. Yeah, his mama died. - Is that right? - Yeah. Is that right, son? Your mama just died? Yes, sir. Just last week. I'm sorry to hear that. All right, get in the car. I'll give you a ride. - Come on. - No, no, we can do... No, it's all right. Don't worry. Come on. Don't make me wait. Can I sit in the front? Sure. Thank you, Officer! All right, let's get the hell out of here. Hey, where you going? Church. Louis? I Sweet by and by... I I We shall meet I I On that beautiful shore I I In the sweet I I By and by I I We shall meet I I On that beautiful shore I I In the sweet I I By and by I I We shall meet I I On that beautiful shore I - Praise the Lord! - Praise the Lord! - Amen! - Amen! I am so pleased to see some visitors with us this morning. Come on up here, son. Come on up here, son! I'm not gonna bite you. Come join me here. There you go. Let him by there. Here you are. What is your name, son? Louis. Everyone please welcome our child of God, Louis. - Welcome, Louis. - Welcome. What is your name? John. - John. - Yep. Why won't you join us? Nah, I'm good right here. No, no. I'm extending my hand in the name of the Lord so we may greet you as a congregation. If you wouldn't mind removing your cap here in the house of the Lord? Everyone please welcome these brothers in Christ, John and Louis. Welcome, John and Louis. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, can we sit? - Please do. - All right. Take your seat, gentlemen. We don't see too many new faces around here. It's exciting when we do. We won't be staying for long. What, you just passing through? Yeah. Listen, I want you to know something. You're welcome to stay as long as you like. My mission is to grow this family. Spread the word of God. Well, like I said, we won't be staying for long. All right. He's a quiet one. Got many friends? I have no idea. A boy needs friends, you know. Jesus had 12 of them. Yeah. Well, look what good that did him. Listen, we're having a retreat tonight. Want to stick around? The boy will love it. You gonna have food there? We'll have food there. One piece of advice. What's that? You want to save a little room for the coconut cream pie. Good to know. Louis, hello, my friend. - Hi. - How are you, son? Good, thank you. I'm gonna sit here and join you if you don't mind. It's fine. We're happy to have you with us today. Happy to be here. So tell me about yourself. Hey. Louis. Louis? Hey, hey, wake up. We gotta hit the road. Come on. What the hell is... What the hell are you doing? - Come on. - I don't want... I'm not fucking leaving! Come on, it's time to go. - What the hell's your problem? - Hey, come on! Come on! This is yours. I hate you. I think you were scared. You're scared they'd find out you're a bad person. A wolf, like the pastor said. A wolf? He called me a wolf? Beware of false prophets who wear sheep's clothing because really they're ravenous wolves. He said that? That's... I'm not doing this anymore. What do you mean, you're not doing this? I'm not doing it. Hey, get up! Come on! We've been over this! Hey, get up! We gotta keep moving. Hey! Can't just sit around all day! Come on! Let's go! Thank you. I need a lift for me and my friend back here. Just take a minute. Hold on one second. Louis! Come on! Louis. Grab our things and take them to the room, will ya? I'm gonna go grab a drink. HOW long? I don't know. As long as it takes me. Give me a whiskey and a beer chaser. - Oh, God. - Okay. Ah! I don't know where the damn kid is. How can you drink those things? They give me heartburn. Yeah? I think they're just fine in the morning. Oh, there he is! Great. This is Louis, Louis Moody. - Hi. - Hi, honey. I'm Mary. This is Rose. Mary and Rose are headed into Mexico. That's right. You're gonna pay for the gas, huh? 'Cause she pissed off our meal ticket! Oh, Rose, shut up! So there you have it. Well, get in. You're driving, right? Oh, yeah. Should I put the stuff in the trunk? - Just throw it in the back. - Back there? Why don't you guys both get in the way back? We got some adult conversations to have. Get in. This is gonna be fun. Were you the one knocking on my wall? No. Yes, you were. Why didn't you knock back? That's how it works, you know. You're supposed to knock back. I don't know. How old are you anyway? I'm 13. Well, I mean, I guess, 14. I'm 13. Is that your mom? You could call her that. It's that you don't look like each other, so... I was just wondering. People say I take after my dad. People say I take after my mom. That's an amethyst. That's turquoise. Oh, I know turquoise. I got a... check that out. Brand new ring. - That's nice. - Turquoise. Well, that's what they call kismet. Oh, yeah? What's that mean? Well, it's a Middle Eastern word for coincidence or serendipity. Ah, kismet. Kismet. So here's the deal. You pay for the gas. We'll pay for our own lodging, okay? All right. You know, I don't just let any stranger into my car. These are unique circumstances, you understand? I understand completely, and we're not exactly strangers at this point. Just don't get any ideas, lover boy. I won't get any. Well, I might get a couple ideas. I'll just keep 'em right up in here. Don't go telling 'em too much about yourself. Remember what I told you about women. Well, look at us. Just like one big happy family. Hardly. Hey, you know what I think we should do? We should go shopping. Might as well have a little fun while we're on this trip, right? I don't know. She loves buying stuff. All right, y'all. What do you think? Well, well, well. Just like Miss America. Can we go now? I'm gonna buy that for you. - We need that money. - I got plenty. I'm gonna go pick out some things for the kids. Oh, yeah. I hate dresses. You two look adorable. You look nice. You know, I'm usually a pretty good judge of character. But I'm gonna admit I read y'all wrong. I thought you were gonna be greedy and selfish like most of the men I've been with. But you ain't and I like you. Yeah? Well, I like you too. You know, my mama always said, "Don't waste time waiting for the perfect man because, well, life is too goddamned short." That's what she said? Wish I could just run away, don't you? I don't know. There's nowhere to really run off to. Where would you even go? Ever been to the beach? Never really had a chance to. That's where I'd go. Somewhere with a beach. You could always come to the beach with me and, you know, we could have our Sandcastle house. Go fishing. We'd survive on fish. Could be a lot worse. If you could, if there was any place on Earth you could run away to, where'd you run? If I had to choose? I'd probably go home. Pretty exciting, right? Is that in New Mexico? I don't know. Well, come on. Tell me something about yourself. Well, there's not much to tell. I don't much like talking about myself. It's not easy for me. Fine. What about the boy? His mother died. And? I'm taking him to live with his grandparents. Well, why go through all that trouble? Well, because he's a good kid. I don't mind spending time with him. Uh-huh. What's in it for you? There ain't nothing in it for me. You're lying. You're a liar. Is he yours? Look at you. I ain't no fucking liar. You're way better. I'm not even making... Snap, snap, Clap- I can't snap. Hey, you know we're not far from my grandparents' house. My mom said it snows there. I've never seen snow. - Really? - Yeah. You should come. I mean, you know, if you wanted. It'd be cool. Yeah. Sounds fun. Yeah. Yeah? Hey, let me talk to George. It's John. John? How's the head? Oh, just fine. How's your sister? Hey, John. Any luck in finding my money? I've got the rest of your $10,000. So you're 10 short. How about this? I bring you what I have. Or you can come looking for the rest. Maybe I'll go and look for it in New Mexico. Farmington, New Mexico. Maybe I'll find my money over there. I don't know what you're talking about. Of course you don't. $20,000, John. See you soon. Our hometown ain't far from here. Y'all can stay with us if you want. Oh, yeah? How long? As long as you want. Yeah, I don't know about that. I think that this little thing has probably run its course. So we should probably get going. Wow. Well, fuck you, John. Well, I think we've already done that, haven't we? Louis. John tell you why he's taking you home? Yeah, he's taking me to my grandparents. No, baby Did he tell you why? I think you should probably quit while you're ahead. Well, I think I'd like to fill in the blanks, okay? John strikes me as the type of guy who's failed at just about everything he's ever done. Am I right'? You always had luck with the ladies, didn't you? But that never lasted and somewhere along the way, all those big plans, well, they fell apart and you got desperate. A little lonely. That's why the idea of dragging him around, well, wasn't so bad, was it? Mom... Don't worry, honey. He ain't like us. Men like him don't have the balls to survive in the real world. All right, listen, lady... But the one who's got the most to lose is you. Do you even know who he is, honey? 'Cause he's using you. Just like he used me. Just like he uses everybody. This is bullshit. They always run. John? - John? - Get back inside, Louis! John, let's just leave. We can find another ride. Louis, get back inside. John, she doesn't know anything about you. She's right, Louis. I am afraid. And I just can't take living like everyone else, you know? The problem is, there's certain things about me that I just can't seem to change. John. John, stop. John! I knew there was something wrong with him. Come on, Louis. We're gonna take you home. It's not gonna end well, honey. Come on, get in. Come on, it's okay. Louis! What are you doing? Get over! Get down! God damn it! God damn it! This is a lot of money. We could fly to Farmington if we wanted. You know what she said about you wasn't true. I don't know, she split me wide open, didn't she? You know, when I was in jail, everyone wanted to blame everyone else for who they turned out to be. Mom, dad, girlfriend, wife. I made a lot of mistakes in my life. But they were my mistakes, nobody else's. They're mine. You know, when you get older, Louis, all those mistakes start piling up inside you. Just a pile of mistakes. Regrets, blame. It's enough to make you feel sick to your stomach. Secrets make me feel like that. Yeah, secrets, too. You got many secrets? Yeah, plenty. How about you? Yeah. I like that girl. Shit, that ain't no secret. Yeah. Tell me one of your secrets. Maybe some other time. John? John? John? Hey! Look at that. Hey, we need some food for the road. All right. I'm gonna go grab some gas. Let's meet back here in ten minutes. All right, you go first. Watch out. Go on! Our APO here is 96309. So drop us a line, anytime, APO 96309 and we'll get it on. Anything else? Oh, that's it. Thanks. This is the 11:00 report featuring John Marks with the news and sports. A brazen daytime robbery of the Alpine Savings Bank has state police looking for an unidentified man and his teenage accomplice. They were last seen traveling west on Farm Road 369 in a tan station wagon with Texas license plates 74EJQ8. Are we going to jail? Nah, we ain't going to jail. You scared? No. I'm scared. What are we gonna do? I don't know. Oh, what a mess. We should go to Mexico. We could live there for years with all this money. We should get a car, but... we could do that. - Kid 1: Give me a rock. - Kid 2: Oh, I got it. I liked the station wagon better. Yeah, well, nobody's gonna be missing this piece of shit. I can tell you that much. Be nice if we could this thing up over 50. I figure we'll drive about halfway there then find a quiet place to camp for the night. What's it gonna be like? What? Your grandparents' place? Yep. I don't know. I imagine it'll be beautiful. Think we'll be there tomorrow? Oh, yeah. We should be there by lunch. First we have to make it through the desert. Then we'll cross into the mountains. We'll know we're getting close when we can see the farmlands. Green, as far as the eye can see. Just like that picture? Yeah, just like the picture. Let me get that for you. There you go. You're looking good there, partner. I want to make a good impression, you know? Let's go. Fill it up, will you? - Morning. - Good morning. He almost finished out there? Yeah, almost. 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Hello? What's the address of your emergency? That'll be it. Okay, it's $20 on pump, $24. $24. That's a steal. You have a good day. Boy? You're the one from the paper. I think you got me confused with somebody else, all right? No. I know who you are. I know who he is too. The truth, sir... The truth is, he's my son and all I've ever done is disappoint him. I've abandoned him. I've lied to him. I found every excuse that I can just to make him another mistake in my life. A secret that I keep to myself. But he won't let me. Please, just let me make it right. Just please let me make it right. Come on. Grab your bag! Don't you hear that? Do you remember the address? What? Do you remember what the place looks like? Do you remember the address? What's going on? All right, I need you to leave. I'm not leaving you. I promised this guy in there I wouldn't run 'cause I can't run anymore. I see myself as a person that I'm supposed to be. A good person, the kind of person that you deserve. I just... I don't have the courage to be that person. I don't have the courage to change. Do you understand what I'm trying to say? Here, take this with you. Take it with you, and go. I need you to go, all right? You're gonna be okay. Hey, you're gonna be all right. Now go, 90, 90, 90- I don't want to leave, John. I don't want to leave you. You gotta go. Go. I don't want to leave you, John. Go! Run, god damn it! Run! Face the car! Hands in the air! What do you think it's going to be like? I'd imagine it'd be beautiful. Surrounded by farmland as far as the eye can see. Just like that picture? Yeah, just like the picture. We're going to do a quick line inspection here in Farmington, New Mexico. Line number seven. You lost? I need to get to Farmington. You are lost. I'm not lost. Oh, whatever you say. Yeah, you're close. It's up that road about an hour or so. An hour? Yeah, at least an hour. But you're young. You could give me a ride. I could, yeah. I'd be a lot more willing if we was to bargain for it. Kid with that kind of silver ain't gonna have a hard time finding a ride home. How about it, kid? 23 Farm Road. 23 Farm Road. Louis? Hey, Grandma. Oh, thank you, Lord! Oh, we thought we'd lost you forever! You were supposed to be here days ago. Just look at you. How'd you get here? I Walked. Oh, Lord. Well, come on in the house. Where'd you start from? What do you mean, you walked? How do you boys get so dirty? It's good to have you home, sweetheart. I want this to feel like home, okay? This was your mother's room. I kept so many of 'em. I hope they don't make you sad. I like looking at 'em. Makes me feel like she's still here. You were born in this bed. This exact one. Really? See? There's your mom and your dad holding you. You were just a few months old. Oh, you've grown so much since then. Oh, my sweet boy.
