Just think. What if it so happens... You can string together all of love's cherished moments. I'll enshrine it in my every breath... Adorn it With my thoughts and dreams. This heart of mine... ...so much in love... ...is noW yours to keep. This heart of mine... ...so much in love... ...is noW yours to keep. Just think. What if it so happens... You can string together all of love's cherished moments. I'll enshrine it in my every breath... Adorn it With my thoughts and dreams. This heart of mine... ...so much in love... ...is noW yours to keep. This heart of mine... ...so much in love... ...is noW yours to keep. So foolishly unaWare Was I... I couldn't recognize you for What you Were. This thing called love... I didn't knoW What it Was, O my dearest one. I said yes, my darling. Don't delay any longer noW. Make me a promise that can never be broken. O my love, my smitten heart could die for you Then Why are you still afraid to tell me so. This heart of mine... ...so much in love... ...is noW yours to keep. This heart of mine... ...so much in love... ...is noW yours to keep. The lovely face I cherished hidden in my eyes... HoW can I tell you. I met her yet so elusively. Hold me in your arms... I am by your side, my love. I am your obsession... I am your aWareness, O my love. All my love is only for you. O my darling I knoW What you so ardently desire. This heart of mine... ...so much in love... ...is noW yours to keep. This heart of mine... ...so much in love... ...is noW yours to keep. Just think. What if it so happens... You can string together all of love's cherished moments. Even if I Want to, I cannot destroy this distance. HoW Would you ever knoW hoW helpless I am. In your memories your promises..., ...I am lost forever. Lost in everything about you. This heart of mine... This heart of mine... ...is noW yours to keep. This heart of mine... ...so much in love... ...is noW yours to keep. This heart of mine... ...so much in love... ...is noW yours to keep. Just think. What if it so happens... OH HI! I Was just passing by. Thought I'd meet you. Why? Can't We even meet, Gia? We could have met, Shiven. That is, if you Wanted to. I alWays Wanted us to meet... Friends. Boy and girl friend. We had such good times together, Gia. Only good times... Not bad times. But Shiven, love is What's there at all times... Because love is not about good times but Who you spend time With. It's so complicated even When you hear it... I mean life should be simple you knoW? Like? Like We Were. God! It Was so beautiful. No complications. Nothing. This good time, bad time... Today, tomorroW... Who knoWs What tomorroW brings. I knoW. I knoW about my tomorroW, Shiven. I am getting married tomorroW. They Went to Delhi? But We Were told that if your daughter Was rejected... ...they Were to go to Jammu. That dirty, loW-doWn sinner! Who is he to reject us? We broke it off. Col. Bakshi has lost his mind! What is he saying? - I pity the girl Who is married to him. Rohit's getting married. Rohit, dial Canada. Give our relatives the good neWs. Okay, give it to me. I'll phone. Your call. - Yes. Hello. - Hello Rohit it's Stephanie. Rohit, it's your sister from Toronto. I'll give her the good neWs of your Wedding. Hello Rohit is getting married. Don't even try to call. Understand? I need to talk to him. Please I am begging you. Rohit, your sister Wants to talk to you. Rohit. Hi. It's me. I am. I need to come and see you. I need to talk to you. I'm getting married okay? You take care. Bye. Hurry. We'll reach Delhi in 3 hours. Quick... hurry. Where's she going off looking so sad? Hey, madam! Listen! That's not the Way. This is the Way. Where're you going off? Taxi Waiting. Madam! Oh Raju! What happened? The end! No end... start. It's the beginning. Rohit Waiting there... He's not Waiting. He's getting married. He told me. So What if he says that? Will you agree? Come With me. I don't dare believe that I came all this Way... ...thinking that he Was Waiting for me. But listen... Listen to me... I didn't need to listen to his family and I just... Listen to me... And I Was stupid. But listen... I have lost him forever... - Will you listen to me or not? There's no hope. - Shut up! I'll give you a tight slap! Your hope of Indian Woman? No, no hope. Eating egg curry and parathas don't make you an Indian Woman. You don't become an Indian Woman reading Hindi English novels. Giving up hope and turning your back on love... ... Will never make you Indian. Indian Woman fight! Fight for love, fight for husband! So, What did the jackass say? Must've said... I can't marry you Stephanie. Can't go against my parents. If he runs aWay, you'll also turn coWard? What do I do, Raju? Come With me. I'll take you there in 3 hours. We'll go there, talk and then marriage to Rohit. Why are you doing all this? - I love you. When you meet Rohit, it's What you say, I love you... That's the reason... Come. Where are We going? Just one more attempt... Your hair's turned White, uncle! Ashu Baba, you! Madam, look Who has come! Madam, look Who has come! I'm on the terrace, drying clothes. Oh, let the Work be, madam. Come and see Who's here! I'm coming. Why are you shouting? Hi Mom. My son... Son, your father... We'll go... We're here just for a While... Tehzeeb has lost her memory. Perhaps this place might... At least get some Water, Kaka. Where are all the servants gone! Our daughter-in-laW is home. Do you remember this place, Tehzeeb? Remember that day... Garlands of floWers everywhere... All the people... the bustle... Music... lights... The festive air... And the Wedding canopy... Panditji reciting mantras... Everyone busy With Wedding preparations... Nidhi's Wedding... Your best friend... And my sister. Look, the groom's party has arrived... Remember, Tehzeeb. I can't remember anything. Try and remember, please. Look, Nidhi's friends are all coming doWn... Laughing and chattering... And your face amongst them all... My heart stopped beating When I saW your face... Congratulations, Kaka. Nidhi is a bride! Shall I make you a bride too? You think it's easy? It'll be very difficult. KnoW Why? Because I'm not going to marry just anybody... Saved in time. Not me... Naughty...! Remember anything? Something? Please try. Remember those people... What people! What Wedding? What day? I don't remember anything! Who let these people in? Where are all the servants? Are they all dead? Tehzeeb met With an accident. She lost her memory. Congratulations! NoW finally he has a chance to mend his mistake. Make him understand... Tell him to leave her... ... so he can rectify his life even noW. Don't say that! He is in trouble. - Then Why has he come here? Where else Will a son go if not home? He should've thought of it the day he married a Muslim. Tell him. There's nothing in this house to give him. There is, father... ...your hate. I have come to ask for it. Hate Tehzeeb... ...exactly the Way you did When she first came here as a bride. Tehzeeb doesn't remember anything... ...not even my love. Perhaps she might remember your hatred. If not my love, your hate may perhaps give her back her life. Please, father... Give back Tehzeeb her memories. Placate her, father! Placate her... Placate her, father! Placate her... Why Weren't you ansWering my calls? Anjali...! I Was about to call you... Vinay please. Don't lie to me. I'm not lying to Anjali. A lot is happening. I need a little time. I don't have time, Vinay. I'm going to Paris. I have a dance scholarship. Come With me. Relax... What're you saying? I have a job here... a family. A home... My life is here. Is this the kind of life you Want? I don't knoW What I Want... I hardly knoW What to do... What to say... Don't say anything, Vinay. Just listen to your heart... ...the Way I heard... And saW... I see in your eyes a man Who Wants a lot from life. I Will give you all that. And more... Anjali please. Vinay. It's Paris. The city of love. Just us... you and me. Please Vinay. Come With me. Please Vinay. Papa phoned... Gia is getting married. I came to collect the tickets. Perhaps you are going someWhere else. Just a minute... Come in. Yes? Looking at the photos? I thought I'd appear in person and come close to you. What do you Want noW, Rahul? Nothing. Thank you I got What I Wanted. What? Being With you. You can't stop playing this game even for a second, can you? Consider, just for a second... What if this is not a game? What if Raooul really loves Kkamini? What if he has alWays loved her? From the time Kkamini Was not Kkamini... ... but Was Kamna? An ordinary singer at a small hotel in Dehradun. From the time Rahul Was not Raooul but Rahul... An ordinary Waiter at the same hotel... ...Whose only desire Was Kamna... ...Whose only dream Was Kamna's love... Okay, let's leave it at that. Let go of all those old things. But if today... If Rahul Were to ask Kamna... Will Kamna fulfill Rahul's unfulfilled dream? If Rahul Were to say today... Kamna, I love you... Will you marry me? Wait... If there is a knock on the door at the same time? Then...? And today, Kkamini's dream is standing at the door... ...money, name, fame... A Whole neW life... A life that begins With Rahul's death? What if Kkamini has to choose betWeen her dream and Rahul? Your dream has come true! Karan Johar announced his neW film. You knoW, he's thinking of casting you! This means We must act quickly... This means... Rahul must die. Hey, aren't you going to Wish me a loving goodnight? All right... listen... May not be love... But I surely found ansWers to my questions. Oh, I forgot the most important thing... My Wine... Cheers everybody. Congratulations on the tears of joy. What're you doing? I'm talking to you! What are you doing? What's all this! LoWer your voice. Listen to me... Rohan and Shai are home. - I knoW... They don't have to see all this drama. This is not some drama! Let go my hand! - Then first listen to me. There's nothing to listen. I have seen it. Shut up! Shut up and listen to me! Listen to me! Why did you do it, Vinay? Weren't you happy? It's not a matter of happiness... ...but of life. There's a World outside the four Walls of the house and office... ...that I Want to knoW... A life I Want to live. I Want to realize the dreams I had the dreams We had dreamed. Don't you remember Seema? The dreams We had dreamt? The dreams you had? Why have We forgotten them? In these 15 years of marriage, they got lost someWhere. That feeling, the love, that excitement... Where has it all gone, Seema? Where is it? Where is all that? Perhaps time has changed... But I love you as much even today. Yes, I too had dreams... Dreams of my oWn. But after meeting you, your dreams became mine... Your life became mine. My dream Was for you to get What you Wanted. I had Rohan and Shai... and you. I didn't Want anything more from life. But I Want... I Want more. May you get What you Want... ...that is my only dream even today. Is this love or punishment? Tell me, O my heart! Why doesn't this endless chain of pain not break? HoW many tests and trials must this love endure? So many diverse stories are Writ by this love. O God... Even if someone lays doWn one's life... It has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. O God... Even if someone lays doWn one's life... It has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. Is this love or punishment? Tell me, O my heart! Why doesn't this endless chain of pain not break? HoW arduous is the journey to reach love's destination! There are no solutions to the heart's tribulations. Every heartbeat emanates sorroW. Every breath breaks restraining bonds. Every moment someWhere... ...plaintive lips sigh a complaint. Someone's World destroys itself for love. O God... Even if someone lays doWn one's life... It has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. O God... Even if someone lays doWn one's life... It has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. Hi. Congratulations... ...on your marriage. I am not getting married. It Was all a publicity stunt. A plan to get a dream role in A Karan Johar film. Sure shot plan. NoW When the plan is about to be successful... I Want something else. Even I don't knoW What I Want. Why're you telling me all this? Because you too don't knoW What you Want. 2 O clock at night... alone... ...distressed... You have all the symptoms of being confused. I guess both of us are confused. Okay, let's decide Who is more confused. HoW many years have you been married? 12...? Let me guess... tWo kids... A boy and a girl. I have met your Wife. She is very pretty. Together in college too... Then marriage Quick rise... Well paid job. Comfortable home in the suburbs. Perfect but boring life. Then you meet somebody... In the office, on the street, bus, train... On the train? A neWness in life... you Want more than What you have. You seem to knoW a lot about me. Not about you but I surely knoW Miss. Train. I understand girls like her very Well... Because I too am a girl like them. Or perhaps I Was... Until Rahul came into my life... So, Miss. Train... She has a name... Anjali. Anjali What? You don't even knoW her full name. You Want to lose What you have... For What? You Want to lose What you could have had. For What? O God... Even if someone lays doWn one's life... It has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. Even if someone lays doWn one's life... It has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. Yes, it's true Rahul is no more. He died in a car accident. Seema... Where is Rahul? Is Rohitji in...? They've all left for Miss. Gia's Wedding. They've gone? - Yes. No one hears the sobbing sighs. No one allays the longing of tormented arms. Raging desires only half-slaked. All hoped for pleasures shattered into fragments. SomeWhere a seed of suspicion... ElseWhere a Wall of hate. Even in victory... There is loss. O God... Even if someone lays doWn one's life... It has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. O God... Even if someone lays doWn one's life... It has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. Is it love or punishment... Tell me, O heart... Don't ask the pain-afflicted... ...What happiness is. What is laughter. Hardship hovers over them... ...in some form or other. O God... O God... O God... O God... I love you. Sorry, madam. I dozed off. Oh this...? I made this for you. Give it to your boyfriend When he says I love you... Delhi ma'am. Mom, I Want the WindoW seat. Mamma, Where's Papa? - He's not coming With us. Madam. I need to get on this flight. Ma'am it's very urgent ma'am. Calm doWn sir. - Sir can I talk to your duty manager. Please sir. I need to board this flight. Seema... I just need to talk. She is my Wife. Seema Wait! She is my Wife. - Papa! - Rohan! - Papa! I haven't come to ask you to forgive me... ...because What happened Was unforgivable. Please don't go. What had to happen happened, Vinay. Nothing happened, Seema. Nothing has changed. No. Everything has changed. It Was you Who said... That love, the excitement... I could never give you What you call life. This is not true, Seema. Then What is the truth? What is the truth? The truth is that in all this, I am left standing like a joke... ...I, my love, my trust... everything. I am going so that you can get all that you Want from life. But you are my life, Seema. And this is the only truth. The only truth. Sir. You have to leave this flight noW. Sir please. Please don't go, Papa. For all of us to go together... ...I suppose We've to catch another flight. You're all right, aren't you? I must put on this act for the World. You are a very good actress, Kkamini... ...but not that good ... I can tell the difference betWeen real and false tears. It's too late... I have lost him forever. When Kamna Was lost, Rahul searched and found her. Because Rahul loved Kamna. And noW When Rahul is lost, Kamna Will find him... ...because Kamna loves Rahul. Shall I cancel our tickets for the Delhi-Bombay connecting flight? HoW're you feeling? Are you okay? I am Ashu, Tehzeeb. Let me go. Listen... I've to make a call. Please... Listen, Tehzeeb. I shouldn't have taken you to my father's house. I shouldn't have taken you anywhere Listen, Tehzeeb. You are With me. That's more than enough. Come home, Tehzeeb. I don't Want to go With you. I don't Want to stay in your house! Because I can't bear to see you like this! You alWays say everything Will be all right... But nothing ever is all right. You are alWays searching for your memory in my eyes. And When you don't find it... You try to act as if it's all fine... ...perfectly normal. You bring me back my smile and hide your tears. I can't bear to see you suffer like this! I Want to see you happy. But my happiness is With you, Tehzeeb. HoW can it be! I don't even knoW you! I need to make a call please... Give me your phone... please. I must make a call. Thank you. I can't remember... Abba, yes. Tehzeeb is all right. Talk to her. Abba... Take me aWay... please! Take me aWay. Sorry. I tried so hard to recognize you... But nothing... reminds me of you. I knoW, Tehzeeb... ...you have forgotten me. But that your heart has also forgotten me... ...is something I can't believe. You'll remember everything one day, Tehzeeb. And if... If I can't... remember? What if I can't remember anything at all? We'll create neW memories. Memories are of life... And Without you, there's no life. What life Will you have With me tomorroW? Whatever our tomorroW may be... We'll make it beautiful together. But if you are not With me... Then I have neither today nor tomorroW. Will you give me my tomorroW, Tehzeeb? Tell me, Tehzeeb! Will you give me my tomorroW, Tehzeeb? But Shiven, love is What's there at all times... Because love is not about good times but Who you spend time With. Whatever our tomorroW may be... We'll make it beautiful together. But if you are not With me... Then I have neither today nor tomorroW. Do you knoW What you are doing, Gia? Let's go. Don't ask the pain-afflicted... ...What happiness is. What is laughter. Hardship hovers over them... ...in some form or other. O God... O God... Hail, Mighty Hanuman! Come, madam. No invitation, no entry sir. We are very sorry sir. What're you saying sorry for! It'll be too late if We don't go in. We don't have orders, sir. Then call the person Who can give orders! Are you the manager here? - Something like that. Sir, he doesn't have the invitation sir. Why's she going on about invitations! This girl here... ...came half-Way across the World. I made her roam all over India. In betWeen my Maya darling had 2 punctures and 4 repairs! She says invitations!! And all this for Whom? That moron of a jackass in there, ha? He promised love and marriage to her and is marrying someone else! She is mad enough to love that jackass. But if love isn't mad, is it any Worth, sir? And she harangues about invitations! You may go in... because madmen don't need invitations. Thank you. STOP! Stop this Wedding! I told you, madam. The jackass Will stop his father When he sees you. Go ahead. Go. What are you doing? - Listen, Why have you come here? Didn't I make myself free on the phone. I cannot marry you. Absolutely I cannot. I Will not. Do you hear me, I Will not marry you. All this Was my decision. It Was completely my decision. I Want to marry an Indian girl... ...not some blonde people like you. NoW I have said it. Are you satisfied noW? Without embarrassing me further... ...please leave. Just get out! You said get out to madam! Are you a man or dishrag? She left her World and came running after you. And you spurn her love! To opt for hate and reject love is the Worst stupidity. If I Were in your place, I'd put my hand on my heart... ...close my eyes... Take a deep breath and say I love you! Then Why didn't you. Why didn't you say it Raju? I love you, madam... I love you too. I love you too. Shall We...? Just a second. SWine. SWine of a Paaji oWI... Ruin and damnation upon you. Your son is jackass no.1. DimWit of an oWI Who doesn't knoW What love means. Go to... Go to hell... all of you! Go to hell... all of you! What are you looking at me for? Read the Wedding mantras. Bakshiji, shall We start? Please start. STOP! Let go. This...? Stop this Wedding? Stop this Wedding! Sir, hadn't I told you? When tWo people truly love each other, they'll get together. I can't find the Words... But all the best. First time, I need to talk. I am getting married, Shiven! Why's the Wedding going on? I mean Why are you getting married? Why shouldn't I get married? Get married. Most certainly. But Why him? Why not him? Look at him... - Excuse me. - Please! Please, don't get emotional. I have to marry someone or other, don't I? Yes. But someone else. Not him. Marry Whom? Me. There I said it. No side-tracking. You must marry me. Why? Because today I realise ... Love is not about good times but Who you spend time With. Gia, I noW knoW... Whatever our tomorroW may be... We'll make it beautiful together. But if you are not With me... Then I have neither today nor tomorroW. Something like that. The Whole mind is here. I said I love you. I knoW I am late every time but today... If you Were late today... I'd have really killed you! If you don't mind. Panditji, you may begin. Wait! Bakshi Saheb... Bloody blighter! Panditji, What are you looking at me for? Start the ceremony. This is simply not done! Every one here... Why don't you do something, Paaji? - No, sir. When man and Wife agree, can a mere Paaji dare disagree! Panditji, finish the ceremony. Yes, yes, Why not. There is no time. Boat... So... you did come. I have come. So, you did find me. I found you. Cheque... Cheque? 10 million. You brought the cheque, didn't you? I forgot. You forgot too? HoW clever. You love playing games don't you? But not more than you. All right. So let's begin. Please, right aWay. If I said... I don't have a cheque for 10 million... ...but loads of love for you... Then? If I said... Rahul, I love you. Will you marry me. Then...? If the phone rings exactly at that time... And it is Karan Johar calling. Then...? And you have become Karan Johar's heroine... Kkamini's dream isn't a dream anymore but a reality. Then...? Hello. Ms. Kamini. I am Karan Johar speaking. I have some good neWs. Hello... - Wrong number. Then... Will Rahul marry Kamna? Good technique... ...to split 10 million in tWo. Accept love's sWeet salute, my darling. Just commit the folly of loving me back. My heart is restless... My heart is restless... My heart is restless... If not the first year... I've to give you something at least the second year, don't I? Happy second anniversary. Mr. Ashitosh Rana.
