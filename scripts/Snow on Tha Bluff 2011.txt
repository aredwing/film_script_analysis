Show you the spot where my brother got killed at. You know, like, when a motherfucker die, or when a homey was a team member, you give 'em some bells, or you give 'em some goddamn-- some flowers or something, you know what I mean? You put it right there, just to remember the spot, you know what I mean? - Frank, that's fucked up. - Yeah, Frank--fucked up. This is my brother, right here. His name was Snow. "R.I.P. Snow." He got killed right here on this corner. He got shot right there. He came right here, but he ain't die right here. He got shot three times. He fucked around and made it to the hospital, you know, and everything, but when they put the medicine and all that shit in him, that made him die, you know what I mean? But at the same time, he probably would have pulled through, but, you know, God got the answer to everything. But, yeah, he died right here. We put the flowers and all that out there, every year. That's my real brother, Antonio James Snow. This is my strip, right here. I walked this strip for 20 straight years, man. From right here-- this is where it all began. My granddad stayed there first. I remember when I first got introduced to James P., when I first ever came to the Bluff, this is where I was, right here. My first shooting was right here in front of this door right here. Nigga tried to rob me and my brother, Snow. I'll never forget it. Snow had a.22 with two bullets in it, the nigga came, right, and he ran-- he robbed my brother right there. They had the car parked right here. He ran out--the driver, and my brother's like, "Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him." I was spooked. Shot the two times--"bow, bow." Tried my best to hit him, but missed him, but nigga know not to ever try that again. And then, boy, I got my rank right then like this. This here bust, so motherfucker know not to fuck with me no more. After that, it was straight really ruckus with me, but at the same time, I grew older, went to jail a couple times. Right here is where my baby mama got killed. Her name was Tashiba Matthews. A nigga shot her, hatin', you know what I mean, because of some bullshit. And the nigga was just geeked up, had done been awoke three, four days, trippin', Iike, goddamn on that thing. So goddamn nigga like this here, so when it all boiled down, it's like, boy, nigga walked down the street with like a goddamn semiautomatic, and she was just walkin' to ask him what happened between them, and he just started shootin'. Shot her, killed her right here. Goddamn blood ran from right here all along the ground, man. She was a girl, and she was cool as a motherfucker. She didn't take no shit from nobody. - Hey, what you doin' that for? - Oh, I told her I was gonna make a book.

But other than that, the niggas from Pittsburgh, they in town, they in our spot. Nigga say, goddamn, they probably have one or two brick, guaranteed. I don't know how many, but, goddamn, they say gonna be one or two. It's a guarantee. So the only thing we got to do is go straight in there, Iay the whole house down, and get the goddamn dope, and get the fuck out. - Anyone went in there bumble, one in the head, boy, for real. - Hell yeah, that's all we got to do. - Yeah, boy. [hip-hop music] # # - That look like Red right there. - Probably right there. - Hold on, hold on, let's see what Red's talkin' about. What's up, nigga? - [indistinct] - Uh-huh. - Red ain't up there, but his folks are up there right now. - They up there? - Up there right now, boy. The just went up there. - All right, all right, I'm fittin' to go on ahead. Let's pull up. Let's go, let's go. Pull over right here. Pull over right here. # # Cut the car. Cut the car. No, we're not fuckin' around. Fuck you. [people shouting and screaming] Where that motherfuckin' dope at? Where that motherfuckin' dope at? Where that motherfuckin' dope? Where that dope at? Where that motherfuckin' dope at? Where that goddamn dope at? [all shouting] Get on the motherfuckin' ground. Everybody get the fuck-- stay the fuck down. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Whip out, whip out. - Hell yeah, boy. - Hell yeah, fuck them sucker-ass niggas. Turn your lights on. Get right. Everybody get right. Act normal. We got those fuckin' niggas. Let's go. Take your masks off. Everybody out. Take all the hoodies and everything off. Get the gloves. We got to throw all this shit away. Yeah, just throw it. Throw it out the window. - What about the gun? - No, we got to keep the guns on us. Let's go. We got to keep it strapped. Hell yeah, so we run into trouble. That's for when we get pulled over. Turn right there. We good. Fuck them niggas. Everything went smooth. Yeah, that's good enough. [coughing] Yeah, that good enough. That's good shit too. Mm-mm. Boy, that's it. Goddamn, man. - Got the power of Red in there, man. - Them nigga would. They say they from out of town. Whatever, we don't give a fuck. The deal is done, and the cake been baked. They need to come on with the drama or whatever they gonna do. Other than that, fuck 'em. We ball. It's Curtis, Grandma. Hey, Grandma. How you be, Grandma? I need a big favor. - What? - I need you to tell the camera about Dad, about dope, you know? About how long you been staying here. - Who, me? - Yeah. - I been here since 1 936. - 1 936, the same house. - All raised up here. - This is a picture of my daddy, right there. - And that's him on the piano. - There's my uncle. - Ain't Curtis over there? - Mm-hmm. Yo, my dad. It's his mom. - I sure wish you'd told me he was comin'. I would have straightened up some, Curtis, and moved some of all these things. - No, it's straight. It's straight, Grandma. - No, it ain't neither. I don't like pictures like this. I like to be straightened out, honey. That's why the scripture teaches us that if my people that are called by my name would armor themselves, pray, seek His face, and turn from their wicked ways, then they will hear from heaven. That means you will hear from Him. He will bless you more, because there's nothin' out in the street but trouble. And death-- you're guaranteed of that. - Yeah, well, we seen that with Tonio. - You can have that though eternal life by knowing Jesus. So you got to straighten up. We got to get you a job, and be a man. God done let you live over 25 years. 25 more, you'll be 50, if He lets you live to get that old. Some of 'em don't even get that old. Look at Tonio, didn't get to 22. - I was just gonna say, 22. - Because if he had known that he was gonna get killed, he would have changed his ways. He wouldn't have been in the predicament he was in. But that's the trouble. We don't ever know where death is. David says just one step between you and death. He said, "One step between me and death," so that's us, too. It's just one step. And you never know when you're makin' that last step. - That shit scary. Gonna take a drink. Word up in the end. This shit over. Oh, we laughin' at her. This shit ain't funny, but, boy. See, I see how she look when she sayin' it at you. But listenin' to that shit, takin' that shit, I been listenin' to that shit-- ain't anything I made a deal for. [hip-hop music] # # - You want to hit that blunt, bro? - It's game over. You get no cocaine. I'm on the new rule. No cash, not gonna get it. - This it right here. - Six. - Hell yeah. - There ain't gonna be no six. - Says who? - We got to make sure everything bagged up. 'Cause we stashin' it. - We chillin' on now, man. - Ain't nothin' but fifties for cocaine. That's why we're baggin' up. Nothin' but fifties. I read that-- It's easy to see, this how this shit go in the street: Either you gonna be the one that doin' it, or it gonna get done to your ass. It got to happen one of them way. But it ain't got one of those on and off, because I was doin' odd jobs, and, you know, tryin' to goddamn see what the move's gonna be. That shit wasn't for me. And then I'm thinkin' in my head, "It's so easy for me to just, 'Get up,"' you know what I mean? When niggas see that gun, it can be fake or real, if you know how to handle it, man, them motherfuckers gonna get up. Motherfucker don't want to get shot. That's the scariest thing in the world, a gun, dead in your motherfuckin' face, the barrel part. And you don't know who that is on the other side of it. Yeah, I got my name right there. I just got her name. - Let me see if for the camera. - "R.I.P. Trice," with a sack in the middle. I'm the only nigga you know, still, got a crack sack tattooed on him, you know what I mean? Dedicated to this shit. 'Cause this is what really made me. If I don't know nothin' about this shit, I wouldn't goddamn have nothin' to eat all them days when I ain't had no job or my mom and my daddy weren't workin'. That shit helped us out a whole lot, so I'm motherfuckin' sayin' dope ain't always been bad. Helped my family out, so I really like to know that, "Hey, well, drugs kill, now, but at the same time, "shit, they also do help you out. "They pay your rent if you ain't got no job, or they do this." There's a lot of shit you can do with drugs, so, you know. Shit still here. Could be still here. It's a still life. Still smokin', still drinkin', still standin' in lines. Still takin' care of children or whatever. Still strapped. We just still. We just still. Hell yeah. We need to go and see what they talkin' about. Bro. Guess we waitin' on them clock to strike, and boom. You know what I mean? We pack up. We still got the goddamn-- don't let me forget that we got to walk around to the other spot, 'cause I got to get something out of there. Bro, I'ma fuck with you. Got them guys don't handle their business, man. But goddamn now, I'm gonna keep everything under control. - Yo, they say the nigga gonna be waitin', so we got to hurry up. Lock the door, bro. Make sure you lock the door. You got to make sure this shit goes down. All the way down, man. Yeah, man, police. Shit. Ah, shit. - Meet that nigga up there, goddamn, how that is. - Get the hell on. - I know, man. - Crazy-ass shit, man. But yo, what's up, man? - All right. How y'all? - All right. - What's up with y'all, niggas? - Fuck around, who the fuck? Now that fuckin' nigga front of-- Iame-ass nigga. Fuck-ass nigga tellin' me don't remember something. I know you remember me, nigga. Everybody know me. You know what I do, pussy-ass fuckin' nigga. Keep it on me, man, instead of that bullshit. Sucker-ass nigga, man, startin' that shit. [gunshots] Shit! Fuck. Shit. Shit. - Let's do it. - Hey. - I see Uncle Curt. I see Uncle Curt. Look, he's talkin' on the phone. He's talkin' on the phone. - There he is right there. - What's up, Uncle Curt? Long time, no see, man. - Yeah, man, it gonna be ugly, but it's goin' down. Hell yeah, man, I've been goddamn thinkin' about y'all like a motherfucker, man. Kita, what's goin' on, baby? Goddamn. I'm so happy to see y'all is the same, boy. Man, I had to goddamn ride that shit out. That fool talkin' about givin' me five years. Somebody had took a warrant out on me about some robbery shit. I already know about some old shit comin' back, but goddamn, didn't know that shit gonna pop up. And then when I went to Grady, goddamn, them fool like, "Yeah, man, you got a warrant." I'm like, "What?" Had a probation hold for that old shit. - We didn't know what was goin' on. - But I couldn't even tell nobody. - Did you get any of the letters we sent? - Yeah, I got them. I got the three letters you sent, and I got-- - Got the pictures and stuff? - Yeah, hell yeah, man. I was like, damn, boy. Feels so good to see these streets. Like good God Almighty, shit. - But you need to, like, lay low for a couple of days. 'Cause I really ain't broadcast. Ain't told nobody nothin'. - You ain't told nobody. - Naw, fools be comin' up to me, "Kita, what's going on?" - That means they gonna be totally surprised. - That is the most important part. But you got to try to stay out of trouble. - I love y'all. I love y'all. - I love you, too, Curt, and I'm glad to see you out of jail. - How the goddamn heck? - I told you, boy.

Goddamn, that's a long time, boy. - What you over there talkin' about? - I'm just tellin' my baby goddamn, you know what I mean, everything good. - Here's your bag. - Here the bag. Say, "Bye-bye." - You want to say bye to Mommy? Give me a kiss. Come give me kisses. You gonna give me kisses? I love you. You goin' with your daddy. - So, shit, we'll be back in, like, two days. - Okay, bye, little Curtis. - Say, "Bye-bye, Mommy." - Bye, Curtis. - Bye-bye. - Bye. - Stop, boy. Hell yeah, Pancho, man, shit. Did this shit like a goddamn-- you know what I mean? Like some shit-- a routine now, man. I been fuckin' with dope now about goddamn... a good 1 5 years, myself, personally, but my uncles, cousins, whole generation of motherfuckers, you know what I mean? Been sellin' dope ever since I was goddamn born, way before I was even born, Iike 25 years deep in the dope game, you know what I mean? First time that ever caught, I sold a nigga a nick for a dime. My uncle wasn't there, and I was at the spot. And goddamn I knew where the dope and all that was. I was about 1 2 years old. Sold a nigga a set. Felt good about the shit. I was like, "Boy, boom boom." Yeah, I goddamn-- I had dope in my system when I was first born. I was goddamn-- what you call that shit? Premature. 'Cause my mama, goddamn, she smoke so goddamn much, and she had me before I was-- she used to tell me, be like, I used to be like this little when I first got born. Look, you know what I mean? Little enough you can hold me in the palm of your hand like that. Yeah, but she didn't goddamn never get took by the folk, even though she did her thing, you know what I mean? But she wasn't never no goddamn-- no geet monster who ran the street. She always made sure children, everybody was straight. And whatever her job was, she made sure that was done before she even did any kind of dope, you know what I mean? But when she do get high, she just want to goddamn, you know what I mean, enjoy herself. And I had to get older to peep that shit, you know what I mean, be like, "Damn, this what make Mama happy." And I was like, "Damn." I ain't feel too fond of givin' it to her, but I rather her get it from-- I rather for her to get it from me than go out there in the street, and somebody sell her some flat or some shit like that. Or, you know, some shit like that what they have in 'em. Or sell her some bad dope or something like that. Ain't no way in hell, man. Yo, man, I can remember myself bein' that little, right there, man, just like my boy. Goddamn, my uncles used to do the same shit, you know what I mean? And it'd be damn nearly the same setup right here. He have some liquor. He had him some weed. He had a pistol just sittin' right there. And he'd be sittin' by the door. When I just thought about this shit, I was like, damn, damn near in the same motherfuckin' position. But this be my uncle, and that's me walkin' around, you know what I mean? That's how I used to be, just like that, while my uncle doin' this same exact shit. I was that little, runnin' around the house, back and forth. Hell yeah. I remember that shit like it was yesterday.
