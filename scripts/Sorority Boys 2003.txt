Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la.|Boo-la. Boo-la. Spence, are you done yet?|We need this... ...room for the bobsled. Jiminy Cricket. Goddamn it, Dave! Mush, I say! -- Mush!|-- Ow! Oh, come on! Change of plans, boys.|Someone ralphed all over|the living room. We need to relocate.|You guys, out. Hey, I will not tolerate|insubordination during my ceremony. Oh, just relax. Look, I thought that your mask|was really scary this time. You two "fraternity|brothers" think you can|do whatever you want in this house,|right? Wrong. I'm the president! Dave? What's that, Adam? I think it's time|the president got laid. Hmm. Fuck you. Fight sexism,|support feminism! Don't fall victim|to the antiquated|standards of femininity. Be proud to be a woman. Look, by going in there|tonight, you're enabling the same|misogynistic mores that kept women in bondage|for the past 5,000 years. They do bondage. Let's go. Thanks. Wait, if you just -- Fight fe-- sexism. Listen, that last|girl you set me up|with was great -- really beautiful. I'm just -- I don't know. I guess I want someone I can have an actual|conversation with. Can you find that girl,|Brutus? Go get her, boy. Go. Fire in the hole! It's good distance. You're still|pulling to the right. Who was that girl handing|out the paper thingies? Oh, she's the|lame-ass president|of the D.O.G. house. She's always protesting|something. That bitch had the nerve|to call me shallow. God, you look so thin. Thanks. I don't even|remember that year, man! I don't remember|that year either. ls that me? You weren't even here! I don't r-remember|if I was... Oh! Ohh... Oh, hey, there you are. Oh, I'm sorry.|ls he bothering you? Um... No. No. You know, "a woman's face|with nature's own hand painted has thou, the master-mistress|of my passion." I heard you drive a Beemer. Ahh... Bad dog. Um, who let the yeti in? Ohh... Doofer! Doof! What? Come on, man,|leave her alone. She's not bothering|anyone. Doofer,|think of the house. We let one dog in,|next thing you know,|we'll have three. Okay. Pledge!! Pledge!! ## What'd I say ## I'm still the dogcatcher. Excuse me. Dogcatcher!! Dogcatcher?!|Whoo-hoo-hoo! If the boys at K. O.K. want war, then D.O.G.|will give them war! Evelyn Wheelwright|founded this sorority with a mission -- a mission to bring equality|and respect to all sisters. Thanks to Patty's|heroic efforts tonight -- Wow... thank you, Patty. ...We now have actual footage of what is going on|at a typical K.O.K. party. See for yourselves. Look at the degradation,|the manipulation. And these poor Tri Pis think that they're|having fun. But they're actually being|exploited and objectified. And this is going on|across the street,|day after day. What we just all -- Direct hit. It's big. This...must...stop. ## It's a beautiful morning ## ## Ahh ## ## I think I'll go outside|for a while ## ## And just smile ## ## Just diggin'|some clean fresh air for ## -- ## There's no sense|in stayin' inside ## ## If the weather's fine|and you've got the time ## -- ## Ooh ##|-- ## It's your chance|to wake up and plan ## ## Another brand-new day ## ## Lead the way ## ## It's a beautiful morning ## ## Ahh ## I just had|the best dream, Dave. Oh, yeah? Yeah... And I never even|went to sleep. Hey, girls. Hi. Ew! So, I thought maybe we|could get together later|and do something fun. Tri Pis are|having a barbecue. That sounds awesome. And after that, we could|go someplace and talk. Okay. The girl|was fair who went upstairs with her favorite KOK. She knocked around|and came back down, and now she takes the walk! The walk of shame --|she's not to blame. Who could resist the KOK? -- Smile!|-- The walk of shame,|she found her fame, and now she takes the walk! Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.|Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Who could resist the KOK? Walk of shame... Now she takes the walk. Oh! Classic. Jeez, bro... You were cutting some|fine ass last night. You had two,|and I had none. I mean, I'm lucky to catch|a little runoff. What should I do, bro? Look, if a guy like you|wants to bring his numbers up, you're gonna have to|bring the quality down. -- Way down. I hereby call to order|this emergency session of the 32nd chapter|of Kappa Omicron Kappa. Come on! Quiet! Shut the fuck up! Thank you, Big Johnson. Gentlemen... we are here... to discuss...|the KOK-tail cruise. Let me remind you of the story of Pete Young,|K.O.K. class of '95. Now, Pete never took|a single test. Pete fell out of his|bedroom window twice. Where's Pete today? Pete is pulling down|$ 1 50k a year all because some alum|got a little play on the KOK-tail cruise. Then there's the story|of the '88 KOK-tail cruise. Those boys decided to --|to skimp on the party. Homemade wine coolers... ...a homeless stripper... ...soft-core porn. Needless to say,|the boys of '88 are still paying off|their student loans. I have no regrets. That is why|I've called this meeting. This year's cruise|is in grave danger. 'Cause you'll be there? Will the social committee|please rise? Gentlemen, the brothers|standing before you have embezzled all of your|parents' hard-earned money. Yeah, very funny, Spencer. The money's in the safe.|I just checked it. Then you won't mind|showing us, then. What the -- Okay. All right,|what the fuck?|Where's the money? Exactly. Where is the money? These gentlemen... have seriously jeopardized|our futures. Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la.|Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la.|Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. I say|we split up the money, and we go|our separate ways, man. Doofer, we didn't|steal that money. We didn't? What just happened? -- Maybe you left the safe open,|and we got ripped off.|-- I locked it. -- Well, if you locked it --|-- I'm positive. Look, Spence|has the only other key. Yeah? Well, what the fuck|are we gonna do now? -- Don't worry about it.|I'll figure it out.|-- Figure it out. Just let me deal with my father|first, and then I'll get us|back in the house, okay? Jesus, Dave.|You look like a mess. Oh...well, you know|life at the house. I remember. Things|get pretty crazy, huh? Yeah, crazy. Good news, son. John Kloss, class of '54,|is coming to the|KOK-tail cruise. I've set up|an interview for you. Oh, that's great. Great? lmpress John,|and he'll groom you|to be his number two. ln 1 0 years, you could be|running the biggest annuity and liability|brokerage in the country. All your hard work|in college will pay off. -- Okay, dad.|-- Boys, you all know Dave. He's head of the K.O.K.|social committee. He tells me|he's going to throw the mother of all|KOK-tail cruises this year. Yeah,|it's gonna be incredible. It's Dave's last year|at the KOK house, and we all know|what that means. -- Oh, yeah. No more free ass! Show us the strut, son. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Strut. Hey, Dave, did they|make you do the strut? Yeah. John Kloss is gonna|be there this year. My dad|set up an interview for me. What? -- Awesome, dude.|-- Oh. You get the job with|Kloss, you turn around,|you hire us. We're set. Dude, I'm not gonna|get the job with Kloss if he thinks I stole money|from K.O.K., and neither are you. Oh, thanks for dragging me|down with you. We just need to prove|that Spence stole the money. Well, although|I hardly feel like this is the appropriate time|to bring it up, what about|the videotape, man? What videotape? The videotape of Adam|humping the Tri Pis, man. Hmm? Doofer,|what are you saying? Well, I'd just finished|studying for some school when I noticed Adam's|speaker was tipped over. On the floor was|a little video camera rigged|to a motion detector. I found a thing. I noticed that its|input cable had come loose, so I carefully traced it|to its source. I got a thing. It led to a metal footlocker|at the bottom of Adam's closet, which was, you know,|already unlocked. lnside, I found|a videocassette recorder. Well, naturally, since|it was his private property, I didn't touch anything. You could see the safe|right by his bed. You were watching my tape? No. -- You're a pervert! You're a|pervert! You're a pervert! No, no. Hey, hey, hey. Come on.|Come on. This is great. Look, Spence is gonna be|on videotape. Look, we need to|sneak back into the|house, get the tape, and we're back in K. O.K.,|all right? Well, how do we get|in, Dave? Tonight's|the "all trim" party, and the only thing walking|through that door is tits. I got a plan. Jeez-ass! -- Mmm...|-- ## Oh, yes,|it's ladies night ## ## And the feeling's right ## Um...hi. We're here for the, um,|K. O.K. "all trim" -- I mean...|"all girl" party. ## Y'all got one ## Move. ## From New York to Hollywood ## Act normal. ## It's ladies night ## All right,|you get the tape. We'll split up. Okay? Okay. ## Oh, yes, it's ladies night ## ## Oh, what a night ## ## Oh, yes, it's ladies night ## Hey, nonny-nonny. Excuse me.|ls this your room? It is now... since I'm the new head|of the social committee. Did Little Red Ridinghood|lose her way to Grandma's bathroom? Yes. I have to tinkle. So, tell me your name, and I won't|follow you home tonight. Uh...Dina. What? Adina. My name is Adina.|What are you doing? Oops. It gets a lot bigger. I gotta go! This barrel thingy|isn't working. Yeah, it's, like,|total foam. Just like a man -- always laying around|while we do all the work. Right, ladies? Why don't you go back|to your cave? Twat. Any sign of Adam? No. Jimmy moved into|our old room. -- I couldn't get past him. -- This dress|is too goddamn tight.|-- Well, I told you. Yeah, well, you don't have|the best selection when you|shop at Goodwill, all right? Dogcatcher! -- Fuckin' love this. See ya later,|big fat uglies! Yeah! Frat assholes! Oh, I hate them! Just because you guys|are plus-size girls, it doesn't mean|they have to be so mean. Oh, are you okay? God. Well, we gotta go. Oh, wait, wait,|wait, wait. Have you guys|pledged a house, or -- or do you --|do you want anything? No. Come on.|Well, are you hungry? ## Girl ## ## You'll be a woman soon ## So, where did you girls|say you were from again? -- Newbury.|-- Bermuda.|-- Minnesota. Well, we -- we transferred. Well, um...good. We're -- we're in the middle|of a membership drive. Yeah -- free room and board|your first semester if you pledge D.O.G. But -- but no pressure,|really. Are you sure|we should let them in? They're a real|pack of barkers. That is exactly|the type of attitude that we have to fight|against, Susie. I mean, D.O.G.|doesn't give in to... media images of|what a woman should be. We need to welcome|all types. Let's pledge. Yeah, good one. No, it's only one night. No, we take care|of business, and|we're back in K.O.K. No fuckin' way. Doofer,|what do you think? I pledged|20 minutes ago, man. Come on in. Here we are. Ohh! It's fully furnished, compliments of|last year's seniors. But it --|it's nothing fancy. Make yourselves at home. This place is so clean. Ooh, candles. Welcome to|Delta Omicron Gamma. Whoo. Ooh. This place is great. Look, let's at least|join Tri Pis, where there's something|to look at. Look at us. We're not|exactly Tri Pi material. Yeah? Well, what|about clothes? We don't|have any more money! Don't worry|about it, man. There's all kinds of|leftover shit in here. Oh, my God, man.|Look at this little handbag. This'll go perfect|with my shoesies. Holy -- So, most of us|know each other|from last semester, but there are|a few new faces. So let's go|around the room and share something|about ourselves. I'm Leah,|house president. And...as most of you know, I can get a little serious|about things. Maybe even a little|too serious. That is so true.|lsn't it, girls?|lsn't it? lsn't it? Sure it is. Sure it is. So, h-how 'bout you? My name is Adina,|and I like sports -- football mostly. Great... Adina. How about you? Well -- well,|my name's Daisy. That's a pretty name. Oh, thank you. I was named after|my grandmother's sister on my mother's side. And I have to agree|with what you were|saying before. You know, I look around|campus, and I see the way|that guys treat women. And as a woman,|you know, I'm not|asking for anything other than the respect|that any normal person|deserves, you know? Yeah. Hi.|I -- I am an exchange|from France, no? I love your American way. Those skyscrapers and --|and -- and the baseball. Ohh! And -- and those|toilets that flush. That's brilliant. A-A-And I-I try and get boys to like me, and -- and they run|away, and I try and|run after them, but I can't 'cause --|'cause -- 'cause one leg's|shorter than the other! It's because of my voice,|isn't it?! No, not at all. Not at all. You guys are super-duper! Um... My name is Patty. Hi. And as you can see,|I'm a giant. I just want to fit in... to anything. M-My clothes... My car. I'm a very gentle person. You're beautiful to us,|Patty. Thanks. That helps. Okay, that leaves one other|girl that we haven't... heard from. Would you like to share|something personal with the group... Robert...a? Roberta. Um...personal? Mm-hmm. Well, um...|my name is Roberta. And... I'm addicted to porn,|and I masturbate constantly. Pillow fight! Pillow fight! Oh! Roberta, stop! Stop! Finally. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. -- Hello?|-- Uh... Yeah? Who is that? I don't|have my contacts on. Oh, it's, uh...|it's me -- Daisy. Oh. I hope you saved me|some hot water. Wow. What?|Ow... Ow. I-I-I got|a little soap in my eyes. Oh, God. This warm water|feels so good. Uh-huh. Ooh! Well, I'm clean. Clean, clean, clean. How do I look? Well, I -- Personally, I think|you look better|with two tits. Yeah. Oh, shit, man. What|happened to my other -- Hey! You're eating my bosom! Look, uh, just try to pay|a little more attention to the details, you know? Yeah. We -- we don't have to be|babes -- just believable. By this time tomorrow,|we'll be back in the house. And after that,|we repress and deny any memories of this|whole experience...right? -- I look like shit.|-- No, you don't. Yeah, I do.|I look like shit. No, you don't.|You look beautiful. That's easy for you to say.|You're pretty. Oh, thanks, you know, I just kind of|threw it together,|and, you know -- Ohh. Aren't you, uh,|late for class, you know? -- Yeah.|-- Yeah. -- Yeah, I'll see|you guys later.|-- Okay. ## You're always dancing|down the street ## Damn it. ## With your suede blue eyes ## Suck my dick. ## Every new boy that you meet ## ## He doesn't know|the real surprise ## ## Here she comes again ## ## When she's dancing|'neath the starry sky ## ## Ooh, she'll make you flip ## ## Here she comes again ## ## When she's dancing|'neath the starry sky ## ## I kinda like|the way she dips ## ln our exploration|of the text, we will learn about|objectification, subjugation,|and obfuscation. Um, excuse me... I think you're|in the wrong class. This is Women's Studies 2b:|Femalehood ln Crisis. Which satisfies my|"history of consciousness"|requirement, right? Have a seat, please. Mm-hmm. The primary text|is my study, "Histrionics|and the Male Demographic: "Examination|of Gender Economics, Oh. -- Huhh!|-- Huhh! Party last night|was awesome, bro. Thanks for putting up|the cash. Hey, whatever it takes|to preserve the reputation|of K.O.K., even if it means|paying for everything|out of my own pocket. Ohh! My collarbone! Well, well, well. Co-inky dinky,|my stinky pinky. Here we are again. Excuse me. Phone moi. Next class will be|a detailed discussion on the myth|of the male orgasm. -- To be prepared,|-- What the -- please read|chapters 1 through 1 6. I strongly recommend|a study partner. So, you know,|would you -- would|you like to, uh -- Fine. Great. Let it burn! Come on, people!|Work it! Here it is again.|She goes up, and she is fouled hard. Hey.|Oh, shit! Oh! Ooh! -- Sorry.|-- You startled old Roberta. You shouldn't be watching|TV anyway, Roberta. -- Ooh.|-- Your name's up|on the work wheel. It's your turn|to clean the bathroom. Okay. Ugh.|I thought guys were pigs. Plaque all over|the place... Teeth scum... What the hell is this? What -- Oh, my God! Goddamn! Ugh! It's a fuckin' Wookiee,|man. Sick. Oh! Ugh!

Some guy put this|on my desk in class today! I am not deaf! Well, we -- we should|all be so lucky. Hey, listen. Listen. Shh. Shh. You -- you forget him. Your voice has real... real... personality. Really?! Y-Y-Yes, it does. Okay. Okay! Now, listen,|you forget about him, and you go and have|some fun -- fun, fun, fun. -- Fat-ass dog girl!|-- Whoo! Mother's ass! Why do you let them|treat you like this?! You can't be|a bunch of pussies... ...your whole lives! I hate this place. Whoo! PMS! Uhh! Hey, Doof...|what do you think of this? I borrowed it from Leah.|Huh? That is pretty. Yeah? Wish I could fit|into a size 6, man. Fuck all! I can't take this! Hey, what do you think|of this? Do you think I'd look good|in this -- like a midriff|and the thing? No, no. You need|something more that -- you know, something|that accentuates|your curves more. What the fuck|is going on here?! What's your problem? What's my problem? Where do I fuckin' start? My bra's rubbing me raw,|I have a fat ass, and I've twisted my ankle|three times today! W-Why are you|wearing heels? We're in college.|No one's wearing heels. Heels are out, man --|last year. Hello. Dude, they make my legs|look slimmer. I have a fat ass. No, you don't. Yes, I do! No, you don't. Look, relax.|It's gonna be okay. No, it's not gonna be|okay. Look at this. Ugh, dude.|Man, that is nasty, dude. Oh, Jesus.|Uh, what is that? I don't know. Oh, my God. Adina, those are the worst|ingrown hairs I've ever seen. Any of you girls have any heavy-flow|maxi pads I could borrow? I soaked through|an entire box this morning, and I had to use a whole|roll of toilet paper and -- Um...I used the last one. Sorry. I gotta go. Bye. That poor girl. I mean, she's so big. She's like Paul Bunyan, man. Do you have any idea|what this will do to us? Hmm? We're not supposed to know|about makeup or periods or self-esteem issues. You're not supposed to see|behind the curtain. Look, you go|to a restaurant, right? It's your favorite place.|You've been going there|for years. You order a bacon burger. You don't want to|see some guy slit|a pig's throat, toss it on top of|a dead cow -- no. You --|you just want to|enjoy your meal. I'm getting that tape. I'm getting|a bacon burger, man. Psst, psst! Jimmy! Who's there? Ohh! Bro! -- Hey!|-- Bro, it's you! Oh, my God!|Where'd you go, man? Everyone's been looking|for you! Don't worry about it.|It's complicated. Listen, I -- Wait!|Bro, I have awesome news! I did what you said.|I got a girl. A skank --|I banged her five times, and she was begging|for more! No, you didn't. I mean, that's great.|That's great, Jimmy. No, no. Wait, I --|you're shunned. I am not supposed to be|talking to you. Hey, hey.|Hey, who's your true bro? Huh? Who told you|about skanks?|It was me, right? Yeah. Spence told me|you'd say that. Look, forget what Spence|is saying, okay?|We've been framed. He told me|you'd say that, too. Look, Spence is a lying|prick with his ass hairs|caught in a twist. He told me|you'd say that, too. Jimmy! Duh! Fuck. God. No, sh-- Bad, bad, bad! What the fuck|are you doing, dipshit? Hmm. Oh! ## She's your adolescent dream ## ## Schoolboy stuff,|a sticky-sweet romance ## ## And she makes you|want to scream ## -- Hmm...|-- ## Wishing you could get|inside her pants ## ## So you fantasize away ## ## While you're squeezing her ## ## You thought|you heard her saying ## ## "Good girls don't" ## ## "Good girls don't" ## ## But she'll be telling you,|"Good girls don't, but I do" ## ## So you call her|on the phone ## ## To talk about the teachers|that you hate ## ## And she says|she's all alone ## ## And her parents won't be|coming home till late ## ## There's a ringing|in your brain ## ## 'Cause you could've|sworn... ## No, not there. -- Aah!|-- ##... "Good girls don't" ## Oh, isn't this fun? ##... "Good girls don't, "|but she'll be telling you... ## Hey! A little help, chunk. ## "...But I do" ## Ohh! No, I --|I can do better! ##... That you know|you can't erase ## -- Oh.|-- ## Till she's sitting|on your face ## Coming through!|Coming through! Aah! Aah! Ow. -- Oh!|-- ##... "Good girls don't, "|but she'll be telling you... ## Hey! Fat city! Clear the way|for Buttzilla! ## "Good girls don't" ## ## "Good girls don't" ## ## But she'll be telling you,|"Good girls don't, but I do" ## ## "But I do" ## ## "But I do" ## ## "But I do" ## What?! Uh... A woman's face|with nature's own hand painted, hast thou, the master-mistress|of my passion. A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted|with shifting change, as is false|women's fashion. Should I...|get under the table and suck your cock|right now? What? Right here? Please -- a few lines|of Shakespeare, and you expect|a girl to swoon. No, I -- Next you'll be telling me|what kind of car you drive. No, no, no, I'm not like that.|No, really. By -- by taking this class,|I'm -- I'm trying to|get in touch with -- My breasts? Yes -- No. No. I know why|guys like you take|Women's Studies courses. No, Leah. I'm not like that. I'm just -- Can we just study?|'Cause that's what|I came here for. ## Sugar ## ## Ahh, honey, honey ## ## You are my candy girl ## ## And you got me wanting you ## How many times|do I have to say it? The toilet is|for toilet paper|and toilet paper only! Aah! Uhh! Another souffl burnt! I cannot concentrate|on my cooking! Well, what's|your fucking problem? Huh? I mean, what --|what's wrong? I want a boyfriend. But, no.|They will not have me. But why? Why? Can I make a little,|teeny, tiny suggestion? Now, just go up, up,|and flick, just like that. Ooh. And after we get|the mustache, maybe we can do|those armpits. And, um, we can do|your knuckles and your back,|your legs... ## Ahh, sugar, sugar ## ...your ass. So, um...who was|that cute guy I saw|you with at the library? No. He's just some frat guy|I have to study with. Oh. 'Cause, um... Well, I got the feeling|he was gonna ask you out. I would never date|a guy like that. But don't you think|that maybe if you -- you got him alone,|away from the other frats, he might actually be|a nice guy -- y-you know, underneath? I can guarantee you that guy is "wham, bam,|thank you, ma'am." No, no,|I hear he's, uh... "Hello. How are you? "You seem like a person|I'd like to get to know. Can I take you out to dinner|sometime...ma'am?" I love when|you braid my hair. It feels so good. How do I look? You look...good. -- Yeah?|-- Mm-hmm. Adina, are you in there? Just a minute, please. Adina, I really have to|pee-pee. I said,|"Just a minute, please." It's tinkle time! I'm leaving. Oh, no, no. Yep. No, 'cause I got|a plan, dude. Trust me. That's your plan --|an aspirin? Oh, trust me.|It's not an aspirin. You drop this little baby in your little hairless|boyfriend's drink -- Hey. Jimmy's not|my boyfriend. He drinks his drink, he goes out like|a little light bulb, and you go get|that tape, man. Dude, is that a roofie? No, that is not a roofie|right there in my hand. Well, it doesn't matter,|all right? 'Cause I'm not|fuckin' doing it. Huh. Wait, this is actually|a good plan. You go out on a date|and get him to take you|back to the house. If there's any problems,|just give me the signal. I'll be right outside.|I'm your wingman. How's this signal, huh?|I'm not doing it. You know, KOK-tail cruise|is next week, and with your grades|and extracurriculars, you're gonna be lucky|if you even get a job. Hey, college boy! Time to tuck in|my hemorrhoids. Uh, uh, uh, uh... No. Come in. Take a load off. So, you like my robe,|baby? I only settle|for the very best. Let's fuck. Let's have a drink|first -- loosen things up|a little. Yeah. Ah. Ooh, yeah. Oh... What's this --|bo x of pornos? Yes. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Someone having a bash? Oh, I bet it's for|that famous boat party you boys throw every year --|am I right? Uh-huh. Vodka and cranberry|for milady? What a good idea. Daisy... Yes? Will you come|wash my hair for me? So, you sassy|she-devil... How 'bout some mellow tunes|to set the mood? ## Get out of my way ## ## Ugly woman ## Ohh. ## You're not here to stay ## It's awfully hot|in here. Take off your bra. I'll open the window. Ooh,|I'll dim the lights. Aah! ## Get out of my way ## ## You've been cheating|on me, baby ## Ahh... Uh-oh. ## I'm gonna count|from one to three, baby ## Drink up, bitch. ## When I say do,|get out of my way ## I'm starting to|get in the mood. Not without a toast. ## You're not here to stay ## ## Get out of my way ## Tonight... I lose my virginity... to a woman I love. ## Get out of my way ## Right. Drink up. Oww! Dave! Where are you?! The first time I tried|shoplifting, I got caught. Me too --|I wanted a Twix, but I thought I should|practice on something|I didn't like, so I stole an onion|and got busted. Daisy, stop poking me|in the butt. Sorry. Wingman! Wingman! Ugh! Wuh. Oh! Ohh! Aaah! Ohhhh! Don't tell Leah, but sometimes I think that life|would be a lot easier if I just looked like|one of those Tri Pis. I mean, do you know|what it feels like to be a constant butt|of jokes? I do. Do you know what|it feels like to|be called a freak, to be humiliated|day in, day out until your self-esteem|is so low, you'd -- you'd walk|a mile out of your way just to avoid looking|in a mirror? Or to be...|peer-pressured into crushing|hundreds of cans|of beer on your head for nine years... despite|the constant migraines and the expensive|C A T scans? Roberta... We love you. Ohh... My giant.|My gentle giant. I feel like... you girls|are my best friends in the whole world. A-And I think|it's time... we stopped|moping around... and started having fun. What kind of fun? So -- so why do|they call it a|gravity bong? I have no idea. Oh, that tickles. Stop that now.|Stop it. Did you leave a|boyfriend or anything|back in Minnesota? Oh, no, no.|My father didn't|want me to date boys. Oh. Sounds|really controlling. He is. He expects me to|graduate, buy a house|in the suburbs, and be part|of his old-boy network. That's really...strange. Well, uh... Daisy, I think you deserve|better than that. I mean, the only way|you're ever gonna be happy is if you're true|to what you want. Your dad's just|gonna have to accept that you have to make|your own choices in life. You know, you're right.|You are. God! Do you hear that? I'm so sick of|those stupid frats|and their stupid music! Oh, oh, oh -- your toes. Watch the toes.|Watch your toes. Oh. Sorry. God.|Do you mind doing it again? Okay. Like you're naughty, girls!|Like you're naughty! Whoo-hoo! ## Double shot of|my baby's love, yeah, yeah ## ## Double shot... ## You want to sleep over? Ugh! You...are strong|for a girl -- for a girl. Guys are such idiots. What -- -- Wingman!|-- ...I lose my virginity to a woman... Bring|the quality down... -- Co-inky dinky, my stinky pinky.|-- ...Way down. Who told you about skanks? Fat-ass dog girl! I banged her five times, and she was begging|for more! So... Good night. Uh...yeah. Good night. I had a really good time|tonight. So did I. I feel so comfortable|with you... like I can tell you|anything. Yeah.|Yeah, me too. I'm glad you decided|to sleep over. ## Tiger Lily girl ## ## Standin' cross-eyed|in the corner ## ## Tiger Lily girl ## ## Standin' tongue-tied|in the corner ## I'm... really...really confused|right now. So am I. I've never done this|before. Me neither. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Why don't you...|come over here|and we'll talk? I won't bite. Come on. Uh, I've got to go. Ah. Ooh. ## She was a rough rider ## ## A cool stroker ## -- Oh. Oh.|-- ## A strong whiner ## Like it hurts, girls. ## I had a hard night ## Make it sting, girls. -- Hurt yourselves, girls.|-- ## I had a hard night ## Oh! Arggh! Ooh.

Jimmy,|where are the tapes? What happened to|that box of pornos,|you little piece of shit?! Jimmy! Jimmy!|I need my tape! Oh, shit. Huh? Can I help you? The girl|was fair who went upstairs with her favorite KOK. She knocked around|and came back down, and now she takes the walk. The wa-- Ooh! Whoa! Hey, where you been, man?|Did you get that tape? No. Where's Dave? Ahh! That's weird. What the hell|is on your skirt, ma-- Oh! Uh...gum...|or something. Yeah?|What flavor was it? Big juicy cock? I don't know what you mean. Nothing happened. Dude,|did you get the tape? The tape? Yeah. Ohh. The tape. Let me tell you|about the tape, Dave. Somewhere between the ribs|and the rohypnol, I had the tape. But what happened? You fucked me over,|Dave! And now the tape|is in a blue crate|on its way to the boat! So...|you didn't get the tape? Where were you|last night, Dave? Uh, well, I was -- What happened|to the wingman, huh? You were with her,|weren't you? You left me hanging|in the wind. Oh, is that what|they're calling it now? Shut up, Doofer! Ohh! You betrayed me|to be with a DO G! You're calling her|a dog? Dog, dog, dog. Have you looked|in the mirror lately? You know, I can't|even believe Jimmy|even asked you out. You know, you're the joke|of the whole house! You're not half the woman|she is! -- You take that back!|-- No. -- You take it back!|-- No. I just want|to stop the fighting.|I want us to be friends! Shush! Well, you tell this bitch that a friend would've|had my back last night. Looks like|Jimmy got there first. Aaaagh! Aaaahh! Aaaaaahh! -- Ohh-ohh!|-- Aaaaaahh!

Ooh, that hurt! That all you got? You're gonna pay! Waahh! Hey. So, you wanna play?|Let's play. Oh,|is that supposed to scare me? Adina, catch! Yah! Yaahh! Ahh! Ohh! Girls, stop it! Eat it! Ohh! Yah! Yah! Okay, easy, now. Go easy. Ahh! Oh! Ohh! You don't understand|what I'm going through, Dave! This is killing me! I was the go-to guy|at K.O.K., okay? Now look at me.|Look at me! I'm ugly! I would never fuck me! That's -- that's not true.|That's not true. You had sex|with Lisa Philbin. Yeah.|Remember her, huh? You're much prettier|than she is. Aaaahh! Football! Football. What? Football. Look, huh?|Look at that. I don't get it. Who gets to go to|the KOK-tail cruise|every year? Huh? Tri Pis. Technically, it's whoever|wins the powder puff|football game. Yeah? With you, me, and Doofer|on the DO G team, the Tri Pis|don't stand a chance. Look, we win the game,|we get on the boat, we get the tape. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. It's perfect. We get on the boat,|you meet with Kloss, you get the job,|you hire me and Doofer! DOGs are gonna be|on the KOK-tail cruise. Oh, I'm not going anywhere|looking like this. No, sir. Why would we want|to play football?! Why...would you want|to play football? Yeah! Haven't you read the studies|about sports and self-esteem?! Mnh-mnh. I wouldn't mind|a little self-esteem. I say we go out there, and we knock their tits|in the dirt! Let's do it! They don't look so tough. Okay,|we're gonna do this. Ready? Break! Uh-oh. Girls! Girls!|Remember what we learned! Come on! Huh! Come and get it, ladies. Aah! Look out. Aa-aa-aa-ahh! Whoo! Yeah, bitches! Whoo! Aaaaaaaahh! This is supposed to be|touch football! -- Aah! Aah!|-- Are you all right? Oh, my ba--gina! My -- she kicked me|in the vagina! Stretcher! Ohh! Get the giant! I want my giant! Aaaaaahh! Thank you, giant. Watch my vagina. Aaaahh! Aaaah! Aaah! Ohh! DOGs rule! Break! All right! Bunch of pink nightmares. Get your eyes off my tits,|rug muncher. Blue 42! Hut! Hut! Oww! Aah! Adina, I'm open! DOGs don't go|on the cruise. Adina! Aaaaah! That's the second injury to the|DO Gs this quarter. She may be hurt pretty badly. It's a go. Hit it! Aah!|Aah!|Aah! That's my trick. What? Nothing. Why are they cheering?! I don't know! God, that is so weird. It's payback time. -- Not till I tell you.|-- Ready? Break! Get against that line.|Show 'em! Hey, Leah, next|to the receiver.|Cover the receiver. Hey, back, Katie.|Get over there. Okay. -- You don't wanna|mess with me!|-- 25! 32! Oh, I'm in your head now!|Oh, I'm in your head now! -- Feel it!|-- Hut! Hut! Waaaaaahh! DO Gs' ball. First and 1 0. Okay, this one's going|to yours truly. Ready? Break! Yeah, Adina! Adina rules! Get that fat-ass bulldyke|no matter what it takes.|Ready? Break! ## Yeah ## ## Yeah ## Blue 48! Hey, everybody... This is the DOG|that Jimmy backdoored! Evidently, the quarterback is|Jimmy's new girlfriend. No! Yaaaaaahh! Okay. The balI's coming fast. We're over here! Yeah. Come on. Times out! Times out! That's the DO Gs' final timeout. We can't win|without you, Adina. -- Right.|-- Right. Listen up...all of you. I am not gonna let you|give up on yourselves. When I first pledged|the D.O.G. house... I thought, "My God,|what a bunch of losers." But I was wrong. This house... has more heart|and more loyalty than the Tri Pis ever had. I mean, sure, they may give|great blow jobs, but... we're a family. Yeah, you know... I think we're still|in this game. Still in it? You're damn right|you're still in it! You can win this thing! Okay, the name of the|play is "Patty up the middle". Me? On two? On two.|Ready? Go DOGs! Red 64! Red 64! Hike! Yaaaahh! Are you all right,|Patty? Yeah, I guess so. Chickenshit. Yeah, go back|to your huddle, freak. Yeah, Sasquatch. What did you call me? Um, chicken...shit. No, after that. Sasquatch? No, before that. Freak? That was it. Thanks. Let's try "Patty up the middle" one...more...time. What do we do? Get out...of the way. This should be|the last play of the game. Hike! Aaaaahh! Ugh! Yaah! Patty! Hyah! Who's number one?! D.O.G.! Fat ass! It's true. Sports does improve|self-esteem. Leah's the first girl I met|I could really talk to. Maybe I should|just tell her. No! Not after what|we've been through, man. Come on.|Eyes on the prize, Dave. We're almost|out of this. Watch it, dog! You watch it,|plastic tits. Oh! Do you believe|that bitch? You going back|to the house? I gotta stop and get|some more lipstick, man. Yeah, I'll go with you.|I need a new dress. Oh, hi. Can I help you|find some-- ugh! Uh, hi. I'm going to a very big,|important party tonight, and I need to look|absolutely perfect. Can you tell me which|shade of lipstick|looks best on me? Um...uh... Um, oh... Maybe the orange. Orange. What|an excellent suggestion. E-- Hello? Hello? Hello? So, once we get the tape|off the boat, then what? We show it at the|national chapter meeting|tomorrow morning, we bust Spence's ass,|we return to K.O.K., and we roll our wieners|back out. W-Well -- what do I --|what do I tell Leah?|I mean, what happens to Daisy? Daisy, Adina, and Roberta|are going to disappear. And this...never happened. Well, I have to tell Leah|something. Tonight, Daisy could|tell Leah that she's|going back to Minnesota. Oh, that's so stupid.|That's such a cop-out.|Come on. Ah. I'm sure this would|look good on an anorexic. Why can't they|design dresses for girls who need to hide|a big caboose? You know,|you really don't have a -- Oh! Please be a size 8.|Please be a size 8. Yes!! D.O.G.! Whoo! Whoo! No DO Gs allowed! Yeah, you fat cows!|Whoo! We were stupid to believe|we'd ever get on that boat. Ay-ay-ay-ayooh! That's our party! And we're going. All right? I've got a plan. Nothing beats the sea air whistling up my dress,|ladies. ## Whoo ## ## Sugar pie, honey bunch ## Oh, yeah. Hello. This way to the|little girls'|room, right? Yes,|it's right that way. Oh! Where's that kid of yours,|anyway? Let's get this over with|so I can go tomcatting. He's around here|somewhere. ## Come and you go ## Whoo! Yo, bro,|why am I dancing with you? ## I'm tied|to your apron strings ## Dude, I don't know. ## And there's nothing|that I can do ## D.O.G.s in the hi-ouse! Mm-hmm. Ha ha ha ha! Adina. Where did|all the Tri Pis go? Hey. Let's dance. Mr. Kloss, Spence Rivington, president of K.O.K.,|class of zero-two. -- Hello, son.|-- Listen, sir... I heard you're trying to fill|a position in your company, and I have to tell you,|I'm like the beer in the mug. I'm the guy|to fill your position. I...know this|isn't easy for you. Oops. It's not easy for me|either, but, um... I'm willing to commit|if you are. One second, son,|all right? We're trying to watch|a little girl party|over here, okay? No, um... I love lesbos. Sorry. Um... You know, uh... I've decided I'm moving|back to Minnesota. But...we can, uh... we can still be together...|in a different way. I mean, I'm -- I'm --|I'm moving, but|I'm not moving. I don't understand you. You know, we can talk|all night when we're alone, but we go out|in public, and you're|a different person. I can't do this, Leah. I thought dating a|girl would be easier|than dating a guy. It's the same story. Care to dance? Oh, I don't think -- No. Davey! John Kloss. I thought that was you. So, your dad tells me you'll be a valuable member|of team Kloss. Oh, absolutely. Yes. Good! Because we start every day|promptly at 10:00 A.M. Welcome aboard, son. All right. Let's go upstairs. There's a tall,|dark-haired beauty|with an ass like an apple I can't wait|to sink my teeth into. I know the one. Aah! Relax! It's me. What are you doing?|I'm hiding from Jimmy. Shut the door!|Shut the door! Come on! Hey, where's Doofer? Looking for your tape. Yeah?|Did you talk to Kloss? -- I got the job.|-- Are you serious? -- And I can pick my own staff.|-- Oh! Oh, yeah! -- Bonus once a year!|-- Oh, that's great, man!|Great! Minnesota, huh? Leah, wait. No, no, no, no, no,|no, no, no. Let her go. We still got work to do. Excuse me. How would you like|to go to bed with|a very rich man? Ow! Oh! You see that one|over there? -- Yeah.|-- Yeah. Got a real attitude|on her. What do you say we play|a little dogcatcher? For old times' sake? Dogcatcher! Ow! Let go of me! Leah! Put her down! Leave her alone,|you fucking dickheads! Piss and shit! Careful, now! Piss and shit!|Piss and shit! One... Two -- Stop! Put her down. Hold on, darling.|You'll get your chance. One... Two -- Dad! David? Dave? Yeah. Good Lord, Daisy. You look like a man. Oh, Leah, I can explain. Give us another chance! I can live with the fact|that you don't love me, but maybe with time,|you could learn to -- Hey! It ain't gonna happen. I'm a dude. Bro? Dude, you plugged|your big bro! Ow! Ow! There's mutiny afoot. Convene the High Council. We must punish these thieves to the full extent|of the original charter. Any last words, gentlemen? Yeah. Hey, you see those girls|out there? Well, you guys treat them|like garbage. Why? What, so you can feel|like real men? You all should be ashamed|of yourselves. You know, I learned more|in one week at D. O. G. than I learned in four years|at K.O.K. And after seeing myself|through their eyes, I don't want to be a KOK|anymore. No? That's sweet. ls that all? You just wait a minute,|there, puffy head. What's that? Oh, nothing --|just a little videotape of you stealing the money|out of that safe! He's bluffing. No. No. No, he's not. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. ls this it? No, I don't think it is. It's all right. Waa-ha-ha! See? He lied. Just a pathetic|stall tactic. Look! I'll teach them|to humiliate me. That's not me. I'll show them who has|real class, because now|I've got all the money. Who's got the class now? Not you. Not them. John -- uh, I mean,|Mr. Kloss, I can|explain everything -- -- Tell it to the High Council.|-- It's time to get even. Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. -- Boo-la.|-- Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. -- No, not the mice! No!|-- Boo-la. Boo-la. -- Aaaaaaaahh!|-- Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. Boo-la. My collarbone! Do you promise to|faithfully administer|the office of presidency? Yup. And do you solemnly|swear to uphold the|values of brotherhood? Yeah. Do you promise to|maintain the superior|social traditions of Kappa Omicron Kappa,|forsaking all others? No. That's cool. Hi. I quit the house. I'm so happy for you. Listen, I know you can never|trust me after what I did,|but I'm glad it happened. What? Under normal circumstances, we never would have gotten|to know each other. I mean, let's face it --|you had me pigeonholed as|a certain kind of person, and the same was true|about me. So that's why I'm glad|it happened, 'cause you're a person|I can talk to. I wasn't afraid|to tell you things I never talked about|with anyone. Like when you lost|your virginity to the bass player|who had huge balls, right? Yeah, actually, that -- that happened|to my cousin Maggie. Look, you don't|have to forgive me. I just -- I just wanted you|to know that meeting|you changed my life. Changed whose life? The sweet girl|from Minnesota? Or the guy scamming on me|in Women's Studies? Or the lesbian? Or the transvestite? Who? Me. Dave. So, you're still|my little bro, right? Yeah... Yeah. All right. Can I ask you something? This is coming|outta nowhere. You remember that night? You know -- our "date." Nothing happened, right? Huh? ## Let's do it right, now,|baby ## Right. I didn't think so. ## You're all I need ## ## Soul to soul, fire to fire ## ## Nothing like|this man's desire ## ## Love is a beautiful thing ## She's my friend... so treat her nice. Go on. ## Love is a beautiful thing ## ## It's so beautiful ## ## Beautiful ## ## Love is|such a sweet emotion ## ## I want to share it all|with you ## Yum. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. ## There ain't nothing|in this world we can't do ## ## Oh, tonight ## ## I want to thank you, baby ## ## You make my life complete ## ## Soul to soul, fire to fire ## ## Nothing like|this man's desire ## So... How's...Daisy doing|in Minnesota? ## One to one, you and me ## Well, uh... She's, uh... taking the semester off|to...get her head straight. Oh. Right. She's a... very confused woman. Hmm. I know the feeling. If you talk to her,|will you, um, tell her I... I feel like|I lost my best friend? Well, I know for a fact|that she feels the same way. Do you think|she'd be jealous if... you and I... took a shower together? I'll talk her through it. ## Soul to soul, fire to fire ##
