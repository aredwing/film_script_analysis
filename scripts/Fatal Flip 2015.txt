The house wasn't the right fit. I'll keep looking. I know that the perfect house is out there. I think I'm gonna go up north next. I miss you. Aah! Aah! It's too bad. Jeff, are you sure we're ready for this? Alex, you're the one who wanted to take a risk. Change things up. That's exactly what we're doing. Maybe I'm getting cold feet. Well, it's a little too late for that. You're right. This is just what we need. I'm not sure I packed everything. Would you stop worrying? We have everything we need. Ah, there it is. And it looks like it's in great shape. Come on. Love the house. Bright and early, like always. We're doomed. Well, well. I think it looks beautiful. There they are! Hello, hello. - Hello. - Alex? - Hey, Babs. - Jeff. So good to see you. Oh! It's all yours. An antique Colonial at this price, it's a real find. - Yeah. - Well, thanks to you. The keys. I've got your paperwork. Wow, look at that thing. You're nervous. Your first fix and flip. You should be nervous. Oh, we got the basics. Fix it, stage it, sell it, right? Oh, selling is the easy part, especially if you let me list it. First you have to renovate the house enough to pass FHA inspection. And you two are sure you want to do all the work yourselves? Sweat equity. That's the way to go. Your wife is very confident, Mr. Taylor. Oh, she's not my-- No, no, we're not married. Not yet. Oh, I just assumed. I mean, after all, you bought the property together. Anyway, inspections are a challenge, and you're on a deadline, right? About 45 days. From today? Oh, we'll be fine. No, the exterior looks good. Just a few touchups here and there. Maybe some light woodwork. Take a look at the electrical. You remember the roof leaks? Yep. And there's a crack in the foundation? Yeah. We really appreciate it. Thanks, Babs. Okay. I've included a welcome packet. Papa's Hardware is just down the street. A lot of local guys hang out there. Most of them know their way around a remodel. Well, it's our house, our remodel. I think we got this. Okay. I'll be back in a week to take some pictures. It's never too early to start looking for a buyer. You never know. You might fall in love with the place. Fix it up, never want to leave. This is ours. Yeah, we did it. I love this vintage wallpaper. Yeah. Can't believe this place was built in the 1870s. This is big. What we're doing, this is really big. I know. And your plan is kind of nuts. Aw! I know. It could all backfire, and we could lose everything. Yeah, but we've talked about doing this for a long time, right? You're pretty handy, and I've always been wanting to get into design. People are making a million dollars, you know, flipping homes. This could be great. This could be really great. Yeah. Told you. You seem eerily calm. I feel eerily calm. Tell me about 45 days. Okay, check this out. We max out our credit cards for the next 45 days, and by the time the bills are due, we sold the house. Pay them off and enjoy the profits. So there will be profits, huh? Yes, as long as we make the 45 days. If we have to pay interest on the debt, that's when we'll be in trouble. So it's not an ideal plan. No, but the timing is right. Hey, we could stay at the firm, work our boring jobs until retirement. Or we can take a chance and do this. This is a great house. Yeah. So I've convinced you of... my daring, brilliant 45-day plan, huh? Well, I don't know. Can we get the money back? Nope. Then I'm convinced. Jeez. I might still need a little convincing. It's your plan. No, it's our plan. Water damage. Hmm. I don't even know where to start. Kitchen. Definitely the kitchen. Specifically the stove. Oh, I need drip pans and an ignitor. Okay. Well, if you're gonna start in the kitchen, then maybe I'll start upstairs. I have big plans for the master bedroom. I wonder what kind of tile they have? Oh, that reminds me. The staircase is a bit rickety, so we might have to replace the entire thing and start from scratch. - Jeff? - What? That's the original banister. That's custom woodwork. You can't just rip it out. You know what? I think we might have to, I'm sorry to say. Jeff, we don't want to be the kind of flippers who don't care about the integrity of the house. We improve and refurbish. Maybe we could use some help. Will you just trust me? Let's get out of here. Don't you think we should have called someone before we just started digging? Oh, definitely not. Make us fill out a bunch of paperwork and make us wait three weeks. We don't have time for all that red tape. As opposed to yellow tape? We're going to find this gas main, and close to that, the water main. How does a nice hot bath sound? Heavenly. Right? Now get to work. Damn it. We can now officially brush our teeth. What? Oh, these are lead pipes. I checked the pipes in the bathroom. They're PVC. They need new fittings. I can do new fittings, but... But these are lead. They need to be completely replaced. They're dangerous, and perhaps they're poisonous. Maybe we were naive in thinking we could do all the repairs ourselves. - Yeah, you think? - We need an expert. A plumber, maybe. I can go to the hardware store. No. Don't you worry about it. I'll do that myself. We're in over our heads. Yeah, just a little. Yeah, I'd go PEX over PVC. Unless, of course, you got the money for copper. Oh, yeah, I definitely don't have the money for copper. Yeah, I like PVC. Worked with it before. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, yeah. You working any jobs around here? Yeah, just a little remodel down the road. Oh, you fixing it and flipping it? Yeah. It's a bit of a headache right now, but-- Congrats. Oh, thanks, thanks. Appreciate it. You went to Michigan? No, no, I wish. My ex-girlfriend went there. Are you kidding me? No, I went to UM. That's where I met my girl. Go Blue! Yeah, small world. I'm Jeff. - Nate Grant. - Yeah, pleasure. Yeah, nice meeting you. Yeah. I ran into a bit of a setback today. Kitchen pipes are lead. - Lead? - Yeah. That's hard to believe. You sure? Yeah, I think so. Well, they could be galvanized. Sometimes corroded galvanized looks like lead. Corroded galvanized sometimes looks like lead. Why don't I know this? I could come by and take a look if you want. Yep. See that? Galvanized. Zinc-coated steel. Congrats. No lead here. Oh, thanks, Nate. Whoo! Any time, bro. Whew. That's a relief. So, uh, you do a lot of plumbing? Yeah, plumbing, electrical, roofing, foundation repair. Even did a little mold removal for a while. Oh, nice. You working on a deadline? Yeah, only the impossible, 45 days. Yeah, I see that all the time. People buy a place without realizing how much work it can actually be. Overwhelming, huh? Yeah, tell me about it. I'll tell you what. I'm new to town. I'm still looking for work and a place to stay. I can lend you a hand if you like. Oh, hey, that would be ideal, but we really can't afford it right now, you know. I get it. I've done jobs like this before. I know there's no money in it until the place sells. Hey, if you help us with the 45 days, you're more than welcome to stay here. We have an apartment above the barn. When the house flips, I can give you a little something. Yeah? Sounds good to me. That's a deal. - Sold? - Yeah. Are you kidding me? I think I'm dreaming. Hey, I really, really appreciate it. Good deal. Yeah? My pleasure. - Well, let me walk you out. - Sure. I mean, I just wish that you would have asked me first, you know. Nate? He's seriously totally qualified to do this. And here. Sit down. Okay. He's totally qualified. He'll make sure we make our deadline. We can't flip this house without him. Fine. Does he have to stay here? Well, he's working for free. I mean, the least we can do is offer him room and board. Okay. Okay? When does your little playmate get here? Hi. Hi. I'm Alex Saunders. I'm Nate Grant. Wow. You're not exactly what I expected. And likewise. Well, it's a pretty big job. Think you can handle it? Yeah. I've worked on a lot of old places like this. I really enjoy it. Looks like you've even got the original banisters here, huh? Come in. In the modern age of football, you-- The modern age? I don't think so. Could we please talk about anything else? I don't know anything about-- - Hey. - Are you thirsty? You bet I am. Thanks, babe. Oh, I'm sorry, Nate. There's more water in the kitchen. You look tough. You look sexy. Yeah. You like my .44 Magnum? I do. Hey. Hey. Really appreciate everything you're doing, man. No sweat. This stuff is fun for me, believe it or not. Yeah, well, you're saving us. Aw, you're a natural. You guys got this. We have no choice. Well, how long has it been? How long you been doing this kind of work? Pretty much since I was a kid. Yeah? Did you ever do any fix and flipping on your own? Yeah, I dabbled in it. It's hard work. All right, let's hit the roofing aisle. Okay, I got knee pads, pry bar, sandpaper. Hello? Oh! Oh, my God! So I didn't find your tape measure again, but I did-- Ahh! Roslyn! Alex. This place is really coming along. Yeah, I know. Where's Jeff? He's on the roof. We have to replace the whole thing almost. Oh, this is Nate. This is my friend Roslyn. She's helping us stage the house. Why don't you take one? I bought it for Jeff, but... - But Jeff's not here. - Right. Oh, thank you. Well, I'd better get back to work. The circuit panel's a real mess. Be in the basement if you need me. And thank you for the coffee break. Any time. - No. - It's a sample. Mm-mm. Okay, it's ugly. I'm sorry. I used all my contacts. I am calling in all of my favors. When I'm finished with this place, it's gonna sell in a heartbeat. So, tell me about the hot handyman. Oh, my God. Can you believe that guy? And also he absolutely hates buttoning his shirts. Oh... No, but seriously, he is a godsend. I mean, he does everything. Carpentry, electric, plumbing, roofing. I don't know what we would do without him. We? Oh, good, good, good, good. You do remember you have a boyfriend. You know I love Jeff. But, I mean, it doesn't mean that I can't enjoy the view every now and then. Well, especially if the view looks like Nate. Ooh. Suddenly the reason you and Jeff have yet to be engaged is becoming clear. Guys like Nate are not the problem. Then what is? I'm just not sure that I'm ready for that planned-out, safe little life. So you quit your job for a stint as a roving house flipper, and you drag Jeff along for the ride. It was his idea. He's jumping through your hoops. You know it. Girl, this is his grand romantic gesture. He's trying to prove he's the one. Well, that settles it. I will date hardhat, tight jeans out there. I mean, you're taken. One of us has to give him a try. Look, I have to go. Call me in a few days. I'm gonna bring by some samples. - Okey-doke. I love you. - I love you. I love you. Thank you so much for everything. - Tell Jeff I said hi. - Okay, I will. You were listening to us, me and Ros. Will you hand me that screwdriver? You better screw it in. Okay. - Like this? - Yeah. - Okay. - Perfect. - Nice and tight? - Nice and tight. All right. Good job. Okay. So, why were you listening to us? Curiosity. Okay, take the grounded wire right there. Put it there. All right. So you bought this place 'cause you don't want to lead a safe, planned-out life? - Is that right? - Yet. Not yet. Got it. Well, maybe I had no business listening, but I heard my name. Okay, now... put that right in there. Be careful. Okay. Wait. Okay, here we go, here we go. That feels right. Ahh. All right. Now flip that switch. - Okay, this one? - Yeah. Is it safe? You don't trust me? Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh, you did it! Jeff: Alex? Nate? Where are you guys? Oh, Nate fixed the circuit breaker. We have lights. It's your favorite realtor! Jeff? Alex? I just want to take some pictures for the listing. Hello? Hello? Hello? Mr. Taylor? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff! Oh, hello. Hi. I see Alex and Jeff took my advice. You must be the new handyman. Yeah, that's me. You know, I want to get your info and put your name in the listing as well. You know, when people buy one of these fixer-uppers, they want to know who did the fixing. Yeah, that won't be necessary. You're under a crazy deadline. Are you sure you can get this all done? You know, I might be able to get you some work in the neighborhood. I have a few friends who I'd love to pass your info to. What did you say your name was? I didn't. $10, though? Oh, my God. How are we gonna make any money? If it was marked $50, you would have paid $50. When in doubt, haggle. Next time, ask me. I'm an excellent haggler. Yeah, I'm not a haggler. It makes me uncomfortable. Well, try me. I didn't know that about you. Hey, can I help? No, thank you. Hey, how's the back yard looking? It's good. All done. - Yeah? - Yep. Oh, great. Hey, baby, just checking in. I found the perfect house. No, you'd really like it. It's just a bigger job than I expected. I think this place has great potential. There's still a lot more work to be done. Miss you. I drank 17 of these once and threw up on my neighbor's dog. Oh, wow! I'm on number two. Eventually, I'll get there. Hey, Jeff? Oh, hey, Nate. I'm going to the store. I'll be right back. All right. See you soon. So what's up with you two? You're not married? Not exactly, but we've been together since college. You know, we occasionally refer to each other as fianc. But she doesn't wear a ring. Yeah, she never wanted one. Huh. All right. Let's get to work. Yep. You ready? Yeah. Yeah, Alex, she's not like everyone else. I mean, she's not like anyone I've ever met. There's no rushing her. She kind of reminds me of my ex, actually. Yeah? - Yeah. - What happened? We were a lot like you two. Bought a fixer-upper and started talking about having a family. Then the economy tanked, and I was having trouble finding work. Fell behind in payments, the whole deal. Lost the house, her. Oh, no. All my hard work and I still couldn't save us. Yeah, I totally get it. Hit a rough patch, too. It's kind of why we did this. You know, wrapped up in our careers. Growing distant. We almost ended it. I think after one screaming match, we did end it. So what is this, some kind of couples therapy? Work on the house, work through your problems? Maybe. How's it going? I don't know. Ask me in a couple weeks. Whenever we make this deadline. Gonna make a payday. I mean, I don't know. Suddenly it feels like a second chance. All right. Let's get started on the roof, huh? Yeah, get these shingles up. - You got it? - Mm-hmm. You got it, right? Right behind you, buddy. - Alex? - Oh, my God. What happened? Jeff fell off the roof. What? He's getting an MRI. It could mean internal damage. Or it could mean that the doctors are just being careful, right? They're just checking everything out. Come on, let's sit. I don't understand. The ladder broke. I feel like I should have been there. This is not your fault, okay? This isn't anyone's fault. Ladders break. I just don't know what we're gonna do now. - Here. - Thank you. I got you. Thank you. Ow. I feel fine now. It's just a broken ankle. Get off my feet for a couple of days, and I'll be back to work. I wish I could have been here. I could have... done something. I still can't believe that ladder just broke. Yeah, me, neither. I was climbing and then I was falling. There must have been like a weak hinge or something. Thank God Nate was there. Oh, yeah, right. He did a bang-up job holding up the ladder while I plunged to the ground. Jeff, I don't know if I can handle all of this responsibility on my own. You'll be fine. You flip a house, I mean, half the job is done by someone sitting in a chair with a leg propped up. That's me. Do you think that Nate can handle the overtime? My leg is throbbing. I'm sorry. I'll go pick up your prescription. Thank you. I'm just beat. Just try and get some sleep, okay? I love you. I love you. Oh, hey, Alex. I thought I'd make you and Jeff dinner. I feel terrible about what happened. Oh, wow. Thanks, Nate. I'm sure that Jeff will really appreciate this. I took him a plate, but he is totally passed out. So are you hungry? Yeah. - Sure. - All right. No, but seriously, I love these old houses. They have so much character, so much history. All the little things that makes a place interesting. I mean, it's terrifying, but it's exhilarating. Going all in, risking it all. I'm just relieved that I wasn't too afraid to quit my job. It's refreshing to work with someone who has so much passion. That's rare. Most people are just into this for the money. I want the money. Yeah, yeah, but you care. You care about this house. I can tell. Yeah. So what's your passion? Well, I've always liked building things, restoring. With just a little bit of work, you can take something that's old and broken down and give it a new life. There's this quote by Churchill that I really like. It's maybe a little corny. It says, "We shape our buildings, but thereafter they shape us." Wow. - May I? - Sure. Uh...night, Nate. Thanks for dinner. You know, I am down to help more if you need help. Mm... How long is Jeff out of commission? Oh, that's my favorite. Well, they say like two weeks, but he really wants to get back to work. You gotta love his drive. Yeah, well, I would love it a lot more if he could actually work. I can't handle being nursemaid and carpenter. Hey, bitter Betty. I know, I know. I've just been really stressed out lately. I'm very overwhelmed. At least you have Nate. Yeah, right. What is that tone? Nate's really been creeping me out lately. I swear to you, I thought that he was looking in my window last night. He is right outside your window. I wish he was right outside my window. If he's peeping on you after hours, why don't you just fire him? It's because he's hot, right? What? Mm-hmm, come on. If some ugly dude was watching you change your bra, you would have a SWAT team come kick his teeth in. But with Nate... Ros... Hey, it's the way of the world. Beautiful people get away with murder. Aren't you setting me up with him? I thought you were kidding. Is he even your type? Have you been listening at all? He is everyone's type. Well, are you sure that you're his? Please. Hey, did you get any more primer? I thought it was mixed in. Not always. That's really interesting. Primer? Nate... Will you give me a hand? I have one more sample book in the car and then I'm gonna head out. - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. Oh, wow, you're really sweet. Thanks. You're welcome. Um...hey. So Roslyn wants to go out tonight, if I'm not too busy. You think I should go? I think you should go if you want to go. You won't be jealous? Why would I be jealous? Wishful thinking. You were watching us. So what? Why? Curiosity. The last few years, I've been chasing jobs around New England. Helping people flip houses? Yeah. It's been pretty steady work. A lot of flippers these days. Have you ever thought about buying your own place and flipping it yourself? I mean, you are the expert, after all. You sound like Alex. Maybe so. I guess if Jeff and Alex can do it, then... So can you. How long have you two been friends? We met in college in an art class. So she was an art major, or design or-- Political science. Have you ever been married? Are you proposing? So soon? Are you deflecting? No. No, no. Never married. So do you want to go eat? Yeah. Okay. Let's go. I'm starving. Let's do it. Here. Don't forget to take your pill. Oh, thanks. Can I have some water? Oh. Oh, I think I left it in the car. Did you mean to leave this out in the driveway? He needs to take his pill. I got that. How you doing, man? Oh, you know. Like I fell off a roof. You? I am so sorry. I have no idea what happened. Yeah. Hey, man, you don't have to keep saying you're sorry. Hey, here. Take your pill. All right, I'd better get upstairs, do some more work. Okay. Hey. You're being rude. Excuse me? It's not Nate's fault that you got hurt. It was an accident. Don't take it out on him. I know, I know, I know. I don't mean to take it out on him. I'm just stuck in the room with this cast, and it's been driving me crazy. I'm sorry you got hurt, but we really have to get this done somehow. You don't think I know that? Look, the bottom line is you can't work. We need Nate. Yeah, I know. What do you want me to do, fire him? Well... We can't do that. This whole thing falls apart without him. You seem tense. It's the house. And Jeff's jealous of Nate. Oh, my God. This is like college all over again. Of course. The hot guy has a crush on you, but you're taken, so he dates me. That's not how I remember college at all. You have a very selective memory. Ros, don't make this a competition. He's just being paranoid, and you're just being coy. So how was your date? We had a nice time. You describe milkshakes with greater detail. Come on, spill it. He was smooth... and sweet. And I love seconds. Nate asked about you last night. Oh, yeah? A lot. A lot? Don't worry. I will take care of him. Even though he's into me. Why do you care? Roslyn, I'm kidding. No, you weren't. Roslyn. Alex. Look, don't be so sensitive, okay? I mean, you're the one who was teasing me about Nate. Now, oh, all of a sudden, I do it and it's just too much. You know, I don't like this. I'm the one dating Nate. Okay, great. Go for it. Date him. - What? - Oh, my God. You know, you're just jealous because you're in a relationship, and you don't get to have sex with every half-naked man that strolls through this house. Here we go again. Why is it that single people think that everyone is jealous of them? You know why I got all the good guys in college? Because I wasn't throwing myself at them. Screw you. You got Nate for that. Hi. Roslyn. Alex and I had a fight. About what? You. Oh. So this is your place? Yeah. You can call it that. Hmm. Can I see? Sure. Huh. What? It's not much. There's nothing to see, really. I don't know about that. I think there's plenty to see. Some things need to be seen. - You done? - Mm-hmm. Oh, my God. What are we doing? "Matthew Waterman." Good morning. Morning. I'm borrowing your shirt. Later. Later. I might get used to this. Me, too. Are you sure you're not in pain? No pain, no gain. How many of those pills did you take? Enough. I just picked up the lighting fixtures. Oh, hey. Oh, yeah. We wanted that in the front landing. Oh, Nate and I thought that it would make more sense in the master. Alex thought it'd be more dramatic in the bedroom. Yeah. Huh. Yeah, I see. More romantic. Yeah, hey, I love it. Boy, I'd better make myself more useful. No, you're supposed to be resting. No. Okay. Tuna melt? With extra cheese. You got it. Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Mmm. Where'd you get this? What? This is a different faucet. Mm, yeah. Nate ended up getting a great price. Uh, what else did you and Nate decide on? Jeff, we picked those out last week. No. We? Yeah, we. You and I. Okay. Oh, knock it off. This is broken. Well, you're the one who thought he was perfect. Yeah. That was before Nate wanted in your panties. Jeff! What the hell am I supposed to do here? We have maxed out half of our credit cards, and now with your hospital bills? Well, this is suddenly on me now? Terrific, Alex. I see the way he looks at you. Would you just knock if off with all this Nate stuff and just keep your voice down? No, I'm not gonna stop talking about Nate, all right? I'm not gonna walk on eggshells for that guy! This is my house, damn it! I thought this was our house. Alex, not right now. Can you eat your food? - Looking for something? - Aah! Sorry. Oh. I found these in your toolbox. You must have dropped them. Are you done? Yeah. I'm sorry. I really am. It's okay. Let's take the evening off. Hmm. I don't think that's such a good idea. Will you just trust me? Well, all right. Yeah? But we can't be out all night, okay? Okay. Matthew Waterman. It wasn't my fault you lost the house. It still wasn't enough for you. You can't leave me! I can give us a big lift. I can save us. I can make this work. Can I help you find something? No. I'm sorry. I have to lean on you a little bit. That's okay. When we sell the house, let's go to Fiji. - Fiji? - Yeah. I think we have to wait till we sell the house. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When-- - Ah. - Oh oh, oh, sorry. When we sell the house. All right, deal. We're supposed to be fixing the garbage disposal right now. No. Hey, hey, what did I say? I owe you a date. I want to be alone with you. I haven't been alone with you in weeks. Oh, my gosh. I was supposed to go by the hardware store to get some caulking for Nate. - Wait. - Yeah? Can you not talk about Nate for a second? Jeff... Just for a minute? - Aah. - Oh. Yeah, let's find a place to sit down. Let's get a dog. Absolutely. Wife. Monica Waterman. Found dead? Hello? Roslyn? Matthew. Where are they? Out. You changed your name. I wanted a fresh start. You lied to me. You said you were never married. Monica Waterman. Your dead wife. That was unfortunate. We don't need to talk about her. Seriously, I rate it top 10. What, the day you quit? Well, it ain't the day I quit. The day we quit. Can't believe you had me go second. Thompson's stunned face when you walk in there and give your notice, and then I walk in there, and, wham, double quit! I know. I felt bad. I thought he was gonna cry. Oh, he should. I mean, you did like 90% of the work. Yeah, you did the other 10%. Okay, yeah. I think he did cry. Carefree days of our former life, right? Yeah. Oh, God, what are you doing? Pick up the phone, give her a call. Nate! Nate, wait! Never enough for her. Nate. Nate, please! Please! Matthew! Matthew! You murdered your wife. It was always the house! Aah! You're not gonna get away with this. I hope they choke you with your tool belt. Aah! Oh, thank you so much for this. I really, really needed this. I told you so. So, you wish your friend was here to hold your hand and buy you coffee? Jeff, you have nothing to be jealous of. I'm not jealous. Okay, I'm not insanely jealous. I just can't keep having this conversation over and over and over. It's just weird. The fixtures and the faucets and half the paint colors. It is like he's trying to take over everything, and you don't see it. Look, we have a million and one things to think about. We can't just keep doing this. We can't just keep butting heads. He's always watching you. So what? Okay, fine. So he has some little crush on me. If it makes him work harder and get the job done on time, who cares? I care. I don't like it. Jeff, we are running out of time. Okay, here we go again. Do you want to get in the car? Okay. You know what? Fine. Just hurry up. We were supposed to be home an hour ago. Okay, I got it. Let's not continue this argument. Well, come on! That is what I call very good spackling. It's not. It's not even flat. And then it puffs out. It doesn't have to be, 'cause what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and sand over all this. - Oh, yeah? - You know what I mean? It's down and up. Oh, thank you. Oh-ho-ho! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Alex? I've got good news. I have a surprise for you. Yeah, Jeff, I'm really not in the mood. Please? You'll love it. I guarantee you'll love it. Go, go, go, go! What? You'll see. You didn't. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I did. Oh, Jeff! Yeah, I'm king of the pipes! Oh, my God. The pipe king they'll call me. Oh, I can't believe it. Give it a test drive. No, just turn it on. I just did. - It's okay. - No, it works. - No, that's okay. - Alex, this works. I fixed it. Jeff, it's okay. No... Hey. Hey. This is my favorite part of the house. Mine, too. - We're almost done. - Mm-hmm. Soon all of this will be someone else's. Yeah. Strange to think about somebody else living in our house. Yeah, it is. What are you doing? Come on, Alex. You know. Nate, you got the wrong idea. Do I? Yes. So I'm just imagining the way that you look at me? I thought you wanted a different kind of life. Adventure and all that. Not with you! Look, you can finish out the week, but you better be gone by Friday. I need to match this swatch. Have you called Roslyn? No. I will...soon. You guys are still fighting? No, not really. Well, yes, I owe her an apology. So Nate's gotten a new job, and his last day is gonna be Friday. What do you mean, he got another job? That's unexpected. Oh, not really. I mean, we're almost done. We only got a few loose ends to tie up. And I figured we could do the rest ourselves. Our first fix and flip. Hey, can I have one of those? Yep. I got two. One for you. There. Hey. Oh, hey. We're out of primer. What? I just bought four cans. Yeah, I used it. You said you wanted the porch done today. It's not gonna happen without more primer. No, that's not a problem at all. I'll just go back to the hardware store. Yeah, I'll be back soon. - Thanks. - Yeah. Want that? Oh, oh, okay. - Hey, call Ros. - Okay. Be right back. Hey. Hey. Listen, I've got a little surprise for you. I'm really busy right now. It'll just take a minute. I guarantee it'll be worth it. Come on. It's upstairs. Come on. Oh, Nate. Oh, this is incredible. Yeah. Wow. Well, try it out. Listen, I'm really sorry about what happened. I wish that I hadn't, you know... Yeah. Okay. - Oh-- - Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, I got a lot of work to do before Friday. Enjoy. Jeff? Are you home? What are you doing? Would you please leave? How do you like the tub? Nate, I need you to leave! You look beautiful. Get away from me. It's okay. Jeff won't be back for a while. Get out. You're such a tease. Get out! Honey! I'm home! Get out of here! Hey, what the hell's going on here? I need this man out of our house right now! There's nothing between us! - Nate, Nate, Nate. - At least not on my end. Nate, I think you should leave. I agree. This has gotten way out of hand. Get the hell out of here! Okay. You're done. Get out! I'm gonna need your key. Hey, this is just a big misunderstanding. My skin is crawling. It's okay. I got you. Shall we call the cops? I'm just glad he's gone. Just gotta check on one thing. Would it be a bad idea to suggest a nice hot bath? Hmm. - Okay. A nice, hot candlelight bath? Hey, where you going? The basement to check the circuit. I'll come with you. No, that's okay. I'm quite the expert by now. Oh, the hot handy girl routine. Miss me? Don't fight me. Uhh! Aah! Aah! Uhh! Alex! Alex! Why are you running from me? I just want to talk. I'm just trying to help you, just like I helped Monica. She couldn't understand. No, she wouldn't understand how much work this is. They'll take everything. The banks, the money people. They'll take the house that you built. I worked my fingers to the bone. I got nothing to show for it. No home. Wife? No. Oh, Roslyn. She made me do it. You can't leave like this, Alex. I'm trying to build something with you that will last. Alex! Alex! No, I was never good enough for her. I could never give her enough, no. I promised her that I wouldn't stop until I found the perfect house. She would have like this place. I had you pegged as a fighter right from the start. I think you killed her. Don't talk about her that way. You're sick. You really want to tear down everything that we built? Shut up. You're just like all the rest. - Aah! - Come here! This is gonna be a new beginning. No! Don't touch me! I can't let you go. I can't let you go. Look at everything that we built, babe. Aah! Alex, run! Aah! Jeff! Jeff! Oh! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's over. Where'd he go? You're sure? - Where'd he go? - What? Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, sweetie. Oh, my God. 6-0. All right, look, we've put out an APB. If he's hurt as bad as you say he is, he's not gonna get very far. Don't worry, we'll catch him. Attention, shoppers. The store will be closing in 10 minutes. Please bring all items up to the front. Yeah, you're gonna need a 3/8 for that one. Let me help you out here. There we go. Voila. Thanks a lot, man. So what are you guys working on?
