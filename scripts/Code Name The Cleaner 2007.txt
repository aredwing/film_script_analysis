It's okay, rela... okay, I... I oughta have a wallet. I'm missing my wallet! Should have some ID. What's this? "Storage check. " Who are you, man? Come on. Come on, man. No! No no no. Shit. What the hell is this? Holy shit! No way! Wait a minute. This is a lot of money, man. This ain't right, this ain't right. Hello, front desk.

You know me? - Are you kidding? - No, I'm not kidding. Hey, what happened to your head? - I gotta go. - Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa. Just relax, you're gonna be fine. I'm here to help you. Over here. Hmm? Roger, Dispatch... Come on. - Huh? - Let's go! Okay. In the car. Wait wait wait wait wait wait. What the hell is going on and who are you anyway? You really don't know who I am? No. I mean, I have no damn idea - who you are. - You don't remember anything? I think that's been established, okay? L... What were you doing at the hotel? I came to pick you up. - You called me. - I did? Wh... what was I doing at the hotel? I don't know. What were you doing at the hotel, Jake? You really have no idea who I am? No, I have no idea! What are you doing? Are you crying? Don... don't cry. Why are you crying? I can't believe you don't remember your own wife. Wife? I'm married? To a white woman? Yes, to a white woman! Look, okay, a'ight, look look look, calm down, don't cry, okay? Don't cry, um... um uh uh, whatever your name is. Diane. My name is Diane. Of course. I call you "Dynamite," "Di Baby," "Di Baby. " No no. You don't call me that. You call me Diane. Of course I call you "Diane. " There's no... okay, Diane. Don't cry, baby, all right? It's okay. Everything's o... come over here and give your man a big kiss. We are definitely married 'cause that's some bullshit. Ow. Jake, we are gonna have to get you all fixed up. Yeah, why don't we do that? Get me fixed up. I need a doctor to check out Jake immediately. Right, he's had an injury. I'm bringing my husband home. Yes. Yes, to the country house. - A dead FBI agent and 250 Gs... - Yes. We're gonna be there shortly, ...and I'm married! - So get the staff ready, okay? It's been a hell of a morning. Yes, sir. Did you notice if your window... Tell me something. The attendant said he saw someone leave the room. Any description? He was black. Oh, well, now that you solved the case, - could you tell me what happened? - I don't know. That's all you can say? That man was part of your team. Look, I know. Find out who this room is registered under. It wasn't registered to anyone. - What, they just let themselves in? - Apparently. How could you not know what one of your agents was doing up here? Look, with... with... with all due respect, all he did was phone. He left me a message saying that he'd come up with a lead, but he wasn't on a secure line and... - And? - And then that... that's it. He said he was gonna call me later and that's the last I heard from him. I want you to search every surveillance tape in the hotel. Whoever did this has to have been seen leaving the building. I'm on it. Oh, what's all this? This is where we live. Wait wait wait... you're trying to tell me I got it like this? - That's what I said, baby. - This is where I live and ain't none of my cousins or nothing living all up in here? All these cars is mine, all that lawn is me, and all this house is mine? Well, that is, until you die... then it's all mine. My mama know about you? Come on, baby. Come on. Yoo-hoo, Daddy's home. Hey hey, what are you doing, man? Sorry, sir. I was trying to take your briefcase. That's all you're gonna be doing, is trying. You ain't taking no briefcase around here... Jake! Simon's our butler. - Our butler? - Oh... my husband's having slight memory problem. - Memory problem, sir? - Yes, memory problems. Look, Simon, I can't remember a thing right now, but don't you worry, all right? I'm just going to settle in and try to get all this to work for me, you know what I'm saying? Now you're gonna leave me hanging. Okay. - Very good, sir. - Thank you, Simon. Thank you, madam. So, uh... what is it that I do around here all day? - You don't really have to do much. - Why is that? Honey, you're rich! - I'm rich? - Hmm. I'm rich... I guess you don't have to do much if you rich. In that case, I ain't doing nothing for the rest of the day. As a matter of fact, I ain't gonna do a damn thing tomorrow, either. Except remember. Right, angel? Yeah. Where the bedroom? Mmm? Wait a minute... I'm rich, I got a big house, married to a white woman. Am I Lionel Richie? Whoo... this is all right, huh! - So this is my bedroom? - Our bedroom. Yeah. And this is my chair? You know, it could use some plastic, and these curtains... these, uh... All yours. I mean, they don't seem like me. I mean, they real frilly. Well, that's because I picked them out. Oh, sorry, babe. You have exquisite taste. Thank you. - So those are my trophies? - Mm-hmm. So I'm karate man, huh? Who are all these white people? That's my family, Jake. Don't you recognize anyone? Why am I not in the picture? - You took it, remember? - I took it. Of course, I took it, I took it. I mean, what are you, Creole? - That's right, baby. - That's what I thought. Them red beans and rice is working! Doctor Soames, madam. - Oh, the good doctor. - Hello. This is Dr. Soames. He's gonna examine you and make you all better. Ahem. Good. Good, 'cause I need to remember something. Like, first of all, where is the bathroom around here? - Right through that door, sir. - Cool. I'm gonna be ready for the examination in a couple of minutes... or a half hour. You got any magazines? Of course. Here they are. - Where's my "Jet"? - "Jet," sir? Yeah, the small, little magazine, like a pamphlet... a lot of pictures, "Beauty of the Week"... for people that like to read, but not too much. I'll get one immediately. Anything else, sir? - I got a craving for Skittles. - Skittles, sir? Yeah, man, I love those little bite-size, chewy candies... They're delicious! They get stuck in your teeth, though. - Right away, sir. - Good. Oh, and if you don't mind, can you pick me up some frozen Tater Tots? Right away, sir. This may be asking for too much... but two birthday balloons and a pony? And a Spiderman kite? Spiderman kite, sir. And get yourself something nice. You know, maybe... maybe get some color contacts or something. - Thank you, sir. - It'd look nice with your outfit. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Yeah, nice. Oh hell, no. I know I wear no pink underwear. Uh-uh... no, this ain't right. That ain't right. Okay. Now, show me the lobby. There it is... that's it, right there. - Okay, I'm gonna need the master tape. - Right. - Okay, that does it. - Your Skittles, sir. That's what I'm talking about, right there! - Can I have a word, Diane? - I'll be right back. - Mm-hmm. Have a Skittle, brother. - No thank you, sir. Come on, man, taste the rainbow. - Good, ain't they? - Mmm. Mm? Mm-hmm, yeah. Here... here's the "Jet" Beauty of the Week. Fine. - There's a sister. - Lovely. Says this girl's hobby is slapboxing and archery. Fascinating. - Those my golf clubs? - Yes, sir. Well, let's fire them puppies up. Yeah. Ha. Okay. Here we go. That would be a slice, sir. Slice of what? Pizza? - Son of a bitch! - Uh-oh. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go... What on earth is he doing? One wing of his brain has shut down. Some recent events, recent acquaintances have been temporarily lost. He still knows how to eat with a fork, drive a car, go to the bathroom... and play golf. Swing, batter! Usually, the recovery transpires in waves or flashes over a three-to-five day period. Any number of things can trigger his recovery... a person's face, a certain smell, a familiar sound. We don't have five days. How do we speed it up? Arousal sometimes can do it. Oh my. Whew, well... That's about enough of this. Simon, I think I'll take a little nap. - Jake? - Oh! Whoo! Are you feeling better? Hell yeah! I mean... but I think I'm gonna have the good doctor come back and take my blood pressure again. Why? 'Cause of these? You bought them for me. Remember? Oh, yeah. Still can't believe that you don't remember me. Well, big Jake can't remember shit right now, but little Jake is screaming, "I'm home!" Oh, come on. Think hard. Yeah, try and remember something. Anything. Come on, for me, baby. Ooh! Like what? Like... the computer chip you had at the hotel. Computer chip? I don't... You went there to return it, - remember? - Well, computer chip, potato chip, chocolate chip... I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just so happy I'm married to a freak! Come on, baby. Give me one memory. Okay, baby, talk and blow now, talk and blow. Okay, a memory... sure sure. Um... Oh, yeah. I remember, uh uh, combat. Really? Uh, oh, some place called "Digital Arts. " - Keep it coming, baby. - No, you keep it coming. Come here. - I wanna tell you something. - Hmm? You know what? You wait here, I'll be right back. Where are you going? Did I cross the line? Don't take too long! Little Jake can't be alone right now. - That's it. I'm not going any further. - Fine. - Plan B then? - Yes, do it. What's in it? It's a hot mix of speed and sodium pentothal. Will it make him talk? Oh, he'll talk, all right. But I have to tell you, there is a chance that it could cause his brain to scramble - and send him into cardiac arrest. - Cardiac arrest? Hopefully, you'll get what you need before his heart explodes. Shit! Whoa. Help me. Yes! Damn, that was smooth. # Get 'em up, put 'em up # # HP, KG, light 'em up... # #...

Oh, so now it's coming back to you. No, I just read your name tag, crazy waitress lady. What the hell is wrong with you? You... attack all your customers? Look, I've already been traumatized. What the hell happened to your head? Ehh... besides you trying to smack me, I... I got hit with something. Ow, ah, ah-hh. Toast up, Gina. - A'ight, I'll be right back. - Yeah. And... "fine ass girlfriend. " Crazy, but fine. Hey, Gina, that building across the street means something to me. That's where you do your business, fool. I do? Like, is that my company? - Your company. - Yeah, like, do I own that place? - Why are you messing with me? - I'm not messing with you. Otherwise, how would I know that this place only has three exits? Or that that woman eats a short-stack of blueberry pancakes every morning without syrup? How would I know that? That this guy drinks two cups of coffee, then steals the sugar packets when no one's looking? Oscar, put the Sweet'N Low down... now! Gina! Gina. Look, some strange stuff has been happening to me. There's only one explanation... am I...? - A fool? - No. - Seriously! - What... Look, Gina, am I a secret agent, - you know, licensed to kill... - Shh shh shh. Shh. We shouldn't even be talking about this. Of course, I mean, this place could be bugged. Sure. Go ahead, tell me more. - You're a killer. - A killer... like... like Green Beret, Navy Seal, Army Ranger? No, you're in a class by yourself. - By myself. - You've got a code name... "The Cleaner. " The Cleaner. Listen, the government calls you in to mop up. Okay, I see where they going with this... The Cleaner mops up trouble. Gina, how many men have these hands killed? Oh, they've taken out a lot of trash. Of course... keeping the world safe from human debris. - Destroyed millions of germs. - Germ warfare. Cleaned countless toilet seats! "Cleaned countless toilet sea... " - What? - You're a janitor, dumbass. - No. - I don't have time for this. No no no no, I am special ops! Try special "mops. " "Broom Raider"! Let me break it down for you... you're a janitor. You work at Digital Arts. Huh? Nah. No no no no no no. - You had to see me yesterday. - Check, please. - Oh, one second. - I'm, like, flipping off balconies, I cannonballed onto a truck and landed like a cat. I was like James Bond on Red Bull. Jake, you know people can do incredible things when they're scared. Scared? Who said anything about being scared? - Ain't nobody scared. - Eggs still up, Gina! Boo! Scramble this, Charlie. There he is. I know the back of that head any damn where. Hey, and with your church clothes on. Where the hell have you been, Jake? - I know you guys, right? - Yeah, I'm your daddy. Come on, Jake, don't play dumb. He not playing. Look at his face. What's going on? Y'all... y'all mad at me? I've been in shit water all morning. - I'm mad at everybody! - So I really am a janitor. Yeah, you. But me, I got bigger dreams. I'm a rapper inside. I'm about to explode. Come on, the "Clean Dirty Doo"? # It's all about doo-doo, they're trying to flush me # # I ain't diarrhea so you can't rush me # # It's doo-doo! Listen to me closely, wiping me like paper # # Can't throw me around, can't flush me! # Excuse me, guys. # We're rolling money like toilet paper, money like toilet paper, yeah... # I went from ballin' to not-at-all-in'. - A couple of coffees here. - Gina, I feel like I'm losing my mind. Now, I think you're my friend. - Can you help me? Please? - Sure. Show me where I live. - Can we leave now? - Okay. Jake, I need you for the video. Jake? Good morning, Digital Arts. Good morning. - He's waiting for you, Diane. - Thank you. - What happened? - I told you... I took him to your house, got him to trust me, - but he didn't remember anything. - You really believe that? Yes, he believed I was his wife. So where do we stand? We've got a janitor out there that's breached our security with company property and has absolutely no memory of any of it. Really? A janitor is really putting you through all this trouble. We have Jake's place covered. We're tracking Riley down and we've issued a warrant for his arrest. My buyers expect the product by Monday. I'm handling it. Here we are. No! That's my crib? You should've seen where I lived yesterday. It was on a whole 'nother level! Cops! - I gotta take you somewhere familiar. - Oh, I believe I'm there right now. # I'll kill you with my plunger # # I'll pull your heart with my plunger # # You ain't never seen a plung... # Oh-oh. Hey hey hey, don't come in here now. I'm cleaning, okay? Oh, no, you look like you gotta go bad. Do not use that last stall. I need to talk to you about uh... - Jake Rodgers. - Oh, Jake? - Yes. - Jake is my man! Yeah, we got big plans! - What sort of plans? - He's gonna manage me. It's me, Ronnie, the Dirty Clean Rapper... me. It's a metaphor, see? Can you feel me? Shut up! Tell me about Jake Rodgers. Is he really a janitor? Uh, not a good one. Otherwise he'd be here now, right? I wouldn't be here by myself, cleaning up this whole bathroom. So he could be doing something else? Right? We all could be doing something on the side. On the side? You're asking a whole lot of questions, um... agent... - Sir. - Sir. - Uh-huh. - You want me to call you "sir" now? Like "mass-sir," like I'm a slave? And even though I don't like the way Jake cleans up around here, I'm not a snitch nor a rat... either one of them put together... I'm not a snat or a rit! Okay? You done hit the wrong janitor! Come on! Oh. So you're gonna shoot me? I was thinking about it. Shoot me. Shoot me... you gonna shoot me in the bathroom. That's what I've been waiting on. This is my street credibility right here! I ain't been shot yet! That's why I ain't sellin' no albums! What was I thinking? That's why I'm not sellin' no albums. If I die, I'm Tupac. If I live, I'm 50 Cent. What if I end up somewhere in the middle, like in a coma? Yeah! I can write all my rhymes in a coma, just... "beep... " "How does he do it?" And writing to the beat of the... "beep... " And every now and then I can show a little struggle and come out... and go back in. Oh, man, selling records and laying down! Oh, shoot me, shoot me in the shoulder. Come on... the top part. No, shoot me in my side, like right here. Dude, like, shoot a piece of fat off. You know what I mean? No, man, that'll hurt. I know... shoot me in my ass. In my ass! 'Cause that will be like what the police do anyway... shooting brothers in the backside. And at the end of my concert I can pull my pants down and show my ass like... "This is what y'all did to me, America!" Shoot me in the ass! Gotta be in the ass. Shoot me right there! Give me another pocket! Put it in my ass, come on! Come on! Shoot me in the ass, come on! Shoot me in the ass, right in the middle. Come on, put it in my ass! Put it in my ass! Put it in my ass! I can take it... Put it in my ass! Put it in my ass! Come on! Right here, in the ass! You know, I... I don't even know you anymore. Oh, damn. All right, here we are. Damn, girl, you kind of a slob, ain't you? Are you always on the job? You've been having a rummage sale? You know you're too cute to be living like this, right? Oh, this is your cell phone. - This is my cell phone? - Check the call log. Maybe it'll help you remember something. Good good good good. This will prove I know what I'm talking about. I'm sure all the numbers in here are classified... CIA, everything. All right, recent calls, here we go... Papa John's, Papa John's, Quiznos, El Pollo Loco, uh... Crazy Chicken. Spies gotta eat, right? Right. This is your work shirt. Explain this. Yeah. You know, it is obvious that I'm undercover as a janitor. - Undercover? - Look, you are a waitress, all right? So this may be over your head, but is there's some serious, serious super-spy stuff going on here. - This is what I do! - Okay, super-spy, - let's take a look at this. - Ow! Such a baby. You know... you really could use a janitor in your life. Look at this mess... Oh, man. Riley gave you those. - Who's Riley? - You don't remember your friend Riley? He's an exec at Digital Arts. Well why would he give me these games? You're a freak for video games, Jake. Digital Arts manufactures them. You even gave Riley ideas on how to make them better. - I did? - Mm-hmm. Hmm. You came in here a few days ago in a big hurry. You said it wasn't safe to go back to your place. You said a whole lot of stuff is gonna make sense to me soon. - Do you remember any of this? - Ack! Sorry. I remember alcohol stings like a bitch. Damn! You said, "We're gonna get away for the weekend, maybe go on a vacation," - remember? - You and I? Where... where, like, like the Bahamas? I can see that... a couple of mai tais, - maybe a little coconut oil. - Mm-hmm. Hey, Gina, how long have I been uh, you know, - hittin' it? - "Hittin' it"? Trust me, you ain't hit nothing yet. You would remember hittin' Mama. - What kind of girl you think I am? - Well, damn, if I could remember what kind of woman you are, I would remember what kind of man I am. Then I would know why my clothes are over here and I ain't hittin' it. Hey, you have left your super-spy watch on the sink. Hey hey hey, don't touch that. This is government-issued, I'm sure. You push the wrong button on this thing and boom! Pah! Goodbye, New Guinea. You know, Jake, I've got a bad feeling... I think we need to get out of here. - Hey, Gina? - Mm-hmm? This may not be a good time to bring this up because, uh, well, it involves another woman. Another what? - Another woman. - Oh, I heard you! What about this other woman? Okay, all right, she told me her name was Diane. The "who-what-and-why" of Diane right now! Well, I met her at the hotel yesterday and then she took me - to this big-ass estate. - Mm-hmm. And then she had a doctor check me out. That's it? - Then her clothes came off. - What? - I'm gonna smack you. - Would... Would you stop... hold on just a second, okay? It wasn't like she was naked, okay? She had on some lingerie. - Ah... - you know? Little cool, little pink thing, you know, with the glittery lotion, you know? Damn it. It wasn't like it was dirty. She was my wife! Your wife? She was your wife? Okay, quit it with the haymakers. Thank you. - Hmm. - That's what she told me, all right? I didn't believe her, though, because in my subconscious mind there was a voice saying, "Jake, don't do this, man. There's somebody out there that loves you more than your wife. " - You expect me to believe that? - Yeah. You know she tried to kill me, right? - Come on. - Shit! Roger that. No luck duplicating the chip? Not by Monday. Know what I've got in my hand? Security footage showing Jake Rodgers leaving the Pacific Crest Hotel. And you know who else is on it? You're just lucky that I got this before any other agent saw it. You're lucky you're still here. Hey, I'm not your employee. I'm not your head of security that you're dating on the side. You get the chip, I set up the buyers and I keep the rest of the FBI off your case. So far, I've kept my end of the deal. A janitor can't outrun a citywide manhunt. What if he's not? Not what? A janitor? What if he's not just a janitor? What if he's an undercover agent? You said you knew all of the FBI assigned to this case. If he's not CIA, NSA, or Military Intelligence, they're not gonna tell us they're on our turf. They're gonna want that bust for themselves, right? - You're serious? - Yeah, it happens all the time. - Parallel investigations. - I questioned him up close, okay? There's no way this guy is faking. Maybe he played you. Or he is hurt... did lose his memory, but he's running on instinct. What better cover to infiltrate your company than a janitor? Janitors go anywhere, everywhere, nobody pays any attention to them. They're hired help. They are the only people who have key cards to every room in the building. Total access. Janitors work after hours, after everyone else has gone home. If I was looking for the perfect cover, that'd be it. He started work here a year and a half ago. That's when we started developing the X-1 chip. No, it's coincidence. A lot of coincidences. A spy pretending he is a janitor or a spy who thinks he's a janitor, either way he's a lot more dangerous than we ever anticipated. It doesn't matter. I want the chip, then I want him dead. Yes. Where? Stay on him. A lead on Riley. Shut up, you idiot! - Did you get him? - Hey, I'm just trying to make sure things are tight... protecting you, show you some love. That's what I do. And I'm, uh, also good at a few other things. Oh, hell no. You are still in cheaters' jail. Look, you need to tell me what's going on here. All right. All right, all right, all right. I found this briefcase at the hotel yesterday. - It's full of money. - How much money? Well, minus a double mochaccino, and a couple of lottery tickets... about $250,000. Oh my, dog, you nicked this cash for a mochaccino and a couple of Quick Picks? Eh... still think I'm a janitor? Look, Diane mentioned something about a computer chip. And I think they think I have it. Maybe that's what they want. Well, if they want it, they can have it! I just don't wanna end up like the dead guy at the hotel. Dead guy? You didn't mention anything to me about a dead guy. It's not the best icebreaker... "How you doing, Miss Waitress Lady? I just woke up next to a dead FBI agent. - What's your special? - FBI? Jake, this is serious. You're in a lot of trouble. - You need to tell me everything. - That's it. I mean, that's all I know. We need to get you back to your place... that'll help you remember. I'm gonna change. I'll be right back. Who is Riley? Diane... freaking wife! Gina... fine-ass girlfriend saying I ain't hit it. Question mark. Computer chip. Digital Arts, Digital Arts... Quiznos, Quiznos... must be a code... Be careful of The Rat. We're in his territory now. Prepare to die, Colonel Bowman. This ain't what you want! Yeah. Gina, - I remembered something. - What? I am definitely not a janitor. I'm some kind of bad-ass Special Forces, like... like Black Rambo. Okay, "Blambo", what else? I'm a colonel. - Hello? - Where have you been? - Who's this? - It's Riley. - Who do you think it is? - Riley? Listen, you were right about everything. Don't trust anyone. You meet me at the airport as fast as you can, SEATAC terminal number one and come alone. Janitor, my ass. - Who was that? - Get your stuff, let's go. Okay, now he thinks I'm coming alone so I need you to sit tight. - But I wanna help. - You wanna help, you... look, I don't know how to say this. Gina, you're just a waitress, I'm the agent. If I wanna know what the soup of the day is, I'll ask you. But until then I need you to sit in the car and just wait for me, okay? It's dangerous in there. - But, Boo... - No no no. No no no no. Don't "but Boo" me right now. Stay in your lane, okay? Oh. ...your baggage unattended. All your personal items must remain with you at all times. This is the last call for boarding for flight #486, nonstop service from Seattle to Phoenix... - Hey, Jake. - Hey. - Hey. - You're Riley, right? Of course. What is wrong with you? - I got hit in the head. - Where's the X-1, Jake? - The computer chip? - Yes yes. Where is it? Everybody is looking for this thing. So that's why I was at the hotel? - You aren't kidding, are you? - No. - I can't remember shit. - You went to talk to the Bureau. You went to meet with the FBl... you remember that? I promise, man. I, I-I, I don't know. The last thing that you said was that you were headed to Boca Raton. Go! Go go go. Hi, honey. - Move it. - Don't do it. Stop. Let's go. Get your hands off. - Hi, baby. I tried to call you. - In the car. L... put... uh, hey... stop! Get your hands off me. - Look, this ain't what you want... - Get in! Hey hey... - you don't have to push me. - Move. - Hey hey hey. Come on, man. - Jake, you might not believe this, but I'm here to help you. I'm telling you, this is your last chance. Obviously, our marriage is not based on trust and communication. Jake, we're not really married. What? - No. - Look, you took something. Give it to me or I can't help you anymore. You call this help? You call this help? Who are you supposed to be, more help? You don't recognize me? - You don't know who I am? - Hell, no. He still doesn't remember anything. Or maybe his memory is back and he's just faking it. No way you can bullshit Stick him. Oh, ooh-ooh. No no no no. Come on and get it. Aye, you got me. This drug is only effective for a few moments. Start to question him. Jake? Jake! Whoo-whoo. Where did you hide the chip? Oh, I hid the chip in... in my treasure chest, under the castle, with my pet dragon, Gus. You'll like Gus. He breathes fire. You gotta be more specific. - Hello. - Now Jake, you got a secret and you're gonna feel a whole lot better if you just give it up and just tell us what we wanna know. Come on. I have a secret? I know I have a secret, I... I admit it, I admit it. But you gotta admit it too. Martha Stewart's hot. - She's hot. - We don't wanna hear this, Jake! I don't wanna hear this! I want the truth! Just tell me the truth! Whoo, the truth is... your breath smells like ass. Whew! Funky time! Okay, that's it. Shut him up. What the hell is that? He's having a reaction to the drug. You gave him too much. Hey! Don't! Don't kill him. - What are you looking at? Go get him! - Run! - Yeah yeah. - This way. - Boy, am I glad to see you! - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Hang on. Sweet Jesus! Damn, they're shooting. Get d... get out! Grab the wheel! Hyah! Hey hey hey. Damn, girl! You got skills. So I take it you're not just a waitress? I'm a federal agent, Jake. Federal agent? Why didn't you tell me? You're on a strictly need-to-know basis... like the soup of the day, super-spy. Okay. The man that shot at you back there, his name is Richard Shaw. So wait... wait, you know him? Yes, unfortunately he's with the FBI too. - Crane here. - Martin, we have a situation here. Uh-huh. I just had a very disturbing conversation with Shaw. Now, you need to turn yourself in immediately. You don't understand. Shaw has turned. That's exactly what he said about you. Just tell me exactly where you are. We'll straighten this whole thing out. - I can't do that, Martin. - Gina? Gina! Shaw got to Crane. We're on our own. Whoa whoa whoa, what does this mean, "We're on our own"? - I've been working undercover, Jake. - Damn. We discovered that by altering the encoded chip in the X-1 video game, classified information can be transferred undetected. Damn! Espionage. That's what it is. Someone at Digital Arts wants to sell the chip on the black market. You get the picture. I was assigned to you. You were assigned to me? For what? Why would you be assigned to me? - Because you have the chip, Jake! - I have the chip. I have the chip. - Riley, did you check out the chip? - Yeah, I checked it out. You were right, Jake... the processor chip for our new gaming console, the X-1, it's got another chip engraved inside its circuitry. Somebody's been developing a spy chip using our gaming research as a cover. You just change around a couple of polarities, you go from video games to making unbreakable codes, you understand? The CIA, NSA... nobody could break these encryptions. So if somebody can get ahold of this thing... they could smuggle in anything, plan an attack, and we couldn't even track 'em down! We gotta stop 'em, Jake. Of course. Of course I have the chip. That's what this operation is all about! And you must be a support-level agent assigned to assist me in this thing. Also, I guess it's a good time to tell you, Gina... My real name is Colonel Bowman. Welcome aboard. I got some bad news for you, Colonel. I'm running errands for you now? What do you need, a PowerBook, an AC adaptor or something? You're not gonna like this. Here's your Colonel Bowman. It's your favorite game. Okay okay, so maybe I got the name wrong, but explain these skills, huh? You learned the moves from the video game, Jake. It's just coincidence. - Be careful of The Rat. - I mean that don't prove nothing, Gina. - This ain't what you want. - Okay? I'm a master! It takes years of training to do what I do. Jake, you leave me no choice. We had you under surveillance. Wait, what? Y'all were looking in my house? That ain't right. We caught you in one of your training sessions. You were spying on a spy? Damn! Oh, it gets worse. Okay, will you turn that off? Not pretty. Ha-aa, this ain't what you want. Turn the thing off. Turn it off. - Turn... turn this thing off. - Okay, okay. Let's go. All right, but we're going back your place. Prepare to die, Colonel Bowman. Wow, what a dump! This is your place. Does it look familiar? This my place? Huh? No. Hey, Gina. Since you're really FBI, I guess you never really were my Boo, huh? Sorry. Hmm, you acting jealous, you... you were just faking that too, right? Jake, let's just say you made it easy for me to keep my cover. Another place, another time. Hey, you never know. - Did I treat you right? - Always. # Am I the lover that I think I am? # You're sweet. You make me laugh. - And we love to eat together. - I took you ice-skating? Yeah, you're pretty romantic. Look how cute you are in those tights. Yeah, but I couldn't get a extra large? - Hey, you've got messages. - Yeah? Hey, Jake, it's Steve, from Quiznos. Bad news... someone jacked our bread truck. No worries, bro. Your sandwich will be delivered as usual. Just how you like 'em... triple oven-baked... "Spies gotta eat. " That's what I'm saying. - That's what I'm saying. - Jake, it's Riley. Sector Seven is just not working yet. You can't kill the man in the black coat before the eagle strikes. I need more help with this. I hope your friends at the agency don't mind. You see? You see, that's what I'm talking about. That's some real spy talk right there. - I knew it, I knew it. - It's Riley. - Mm-hmm. - You're right. Hauck must be in on this. When you meet the FBI, remember: No names, no IDs. Only contact me on my cell. You gotta come through on this. From here on out you're "The Cleaner. " - Did you hear that? - Yeah, I did, actually. I'm "The Cleaner," I'm "The Cleaner"! I knew it! I told you! It's Riley again. Did you leave town? You mentioned Boca Raton. Where are you, Jake? - Boca Raton? - Were you planning a trip there? No! No. Boca Raton is a city north of Miami in Florida. Nothing. Boca Raton... "the mouth of the rat. " - Huh? - Spanish for "mouth of the rat. " "Mouth of the rat. " Mouth of The Rat... yes! - I know where the chip is! - You know where the chip is? That's what I'm saying. - You're sure? - Yes, yes! I'm positive! Come on! - What? - Would you put th... - bac... those are mine! - Stop it! Look, I don't wanna be noticed. Well, I guarantee you're gonna get noticed in that getup. Look, would you put those back? The plan is we get in, we get out. It's simple. Maybe you're right. I mean it is after hours. Nobody'll recognize me. Hey, can you open the gate? Well, if it isn't Mr. Jake Rodgers. You know everybody is looking for you? I could get $75 for turning you in. What's going on? I know, baby, okay? But right now, I need you to let me in. Baby, I know you didn't just call me "baby"! How about calling me "Jacuzzi"? How about that, Jake? Why would I call you that? 'Cause it's my name. - It's French. - French? - You don't know nothing about that. - Look, okay, whatever. Jacuzzi, would you open the gate, please? No! You didn't even remember my name. I guess you also forgot how you was all up on a sister at the Christmas party? Just all up in through here. No no, I wasn't with you at no company Christmas party. What? Okay, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh! What? Bam! But uh... Huh-uh. What the hell! - Hmm? - No! Is that a goat? Whoo! Are we in the manger? Okay, wait, hold on. Is it all coming back to you now? Damn, do everybody got pictures of me? You promised me dinner, Jake, and I want it. - Look, fine. - And I don't want no damn nine-piece. I wanna go to a nice restaurant where they got the salad bar - and free refills. - Okay, free refills, you got it, okay? But right now, I'm gonna have to ask you - to get in the trunk. - What? Look, this is for your benefit so you don't get fired or nothing, okay, from your job. Get in the trunk. No, I ain't getting in no trunk. - Get in the trunk. - No! Get in the trunk. You went with Asian? - Hello, Riley. - Hello. So tell us... what was your meeting with Jake about? Oh, we were discussing how to get you behind bars. What happened to you? You used to be a real team player. Well, that was when the team made video games, not weapons. You shouldn't have called the FBI. At the time I didn't know that you'd bought a few agents. One less, thanks to your friend Jake. What? What are you talking about? Eric, I think you should take a look at this. Shh! It's this way. How do you know? I just do. Bad memory and an attitude. Okay, this is it. Colonel Bowman's revenge. Remember... we get in, we get out. Okay. This is the motion capture stage for the game designers. I remember sneaking in here. Check this out. This is it. This is the throne of the drug lord, code name "The Rat. " I knew it! I knew all this stuff was real! So now what? "Boca Raton," baby. You said it yourself... "the mouth of the rat. " I hid the X-1 right here. - The chip! - How do you like me now? - You did it! - That's right, I did it. Okay, come on. Let's get out of here. So nice of you to come, Mr. Rodgers. So nice of you to come, Mr. Rodgers. So nice of you to come, Mr. Rodgers. Thanks for calling the FBI on such an important matter. Anything I can do to help my country. You fellas got some ID? You're a cautious man. That's good. Now hand over the chip. Got a little something for me? Here it is... $1/4-million in thanks. Obviously, this is just between us. It seems a little more than a thank you. Seems like a payoff. I was just testing you. Something's not right here. Don't get too clever, janitor. Give us the chip and take your gift. I got a feeling if I give you this chip I ain't getting no gift. Am I right? I ain't leaving this room either, am I? Ah. Man, I ain't got the chip with me. I mean, do I look like a sucker? I mean, do you think I'm gonna come into a strange room with the thing in my pocket? No, man! Okay, yeah. Yeah, I remember everything now. Y'all in some shit. Yeah, you... I'm gonna take my right elbow and hit you in the Adam's apple, knock it out. Then you... I'm gonna kick you with my size-12 shoe... And then you... I'm gonna hit you with him! And there ain't gonna be a damn thing you can do about it, because I'm with the CIA! Ha! Jake, what are you talking about? The CIA? You said it on the answering machine... I'm with the Agency. The Agency for Custodial Professionals. Jake, you're a janitor! Wha...? Uh-oh. We're gonna die! Run! Shoot! Argh! How are we supposed to get in and get out now? Hey, wh... wh... We're trapped, Gina. They got us! They got us! So I'm just a janitor. I don't fight crime, I fight grime! I get it, I get it. I'm running out of bullets. We should just give up. Hey, we give up! We're coming out! Jake, I need you to pull yourself together right now, okay? Okay. All right, all right. - I need your help! - Oh! Okay. Okay. This ain't what you want! I'm out. Go! I knew it was a weapon. What are you doing? Jake? Come on. Come on, let's go. You, go! Go on! Ooh. Wow. Go on, go! Oh. Jake! - Come on! - Go go! Go go go go! Give it up, Jake. You can't win. You're just a janitor. Yahh! Yeah, you're being mopped by The Cleaner! - Huh. - Damn, he hit me! Stop right there, Mr. Hauck! Do you know who I am? Yes, sir. We're just doing our job. Too bad. Huh? - Ooh! - Damn, girl. Get 'em, girl! Oh, shit. How do you like that? You all right? Hand over the chip, mop boy. Mop boy? This ain't what you want. And that's for wearing pink underwear, you freak. Come on. Oh. You all right? Oh, Jake, that was amazing. Well, people do some pretty incredible things when they're scared out of their minds. Don't make me laugh. It hurts. Am I bleeding? No. He... he hit me in the mouth. I wish I had my nunchucks. Yeah. Get out of my way. ...stomach. He hit me, and it kind of hurt. - Yeah, but then you came back. - Then I'm... bow! He was on me... There he is. Jake! - Hey-hey! - Good work. - Yeah, man. - I'm never gonna forget this. Hey, I'm just happy to help. So you two were working together all along? Well, Jake discovered the X-1, he came to me, and together we planned how to flush these guys out. Gina... I never should have doubted you. - Nice work. - Thank you, sir. I couldn't have done it without Jake Rodgers. This is my boss, Martin Crane. So you're "the" Jake? Jake Rodgers. How are you? The Bureau thanks you. Well, everybody except for Shaw, right? Listen, we could use a good man like you. How would you like to join our training program? What? Me? The FBI? Like, with... with the whole badge and everything? I don't know. L... No, sir, I'm gonna stick with the Agency. Somebody's gotta keep this place clean. It's what I do. Jake, I don't think that needs to concern you anymore. I trusted you and you came through. I got a little surprise for you. What are you talking about? Don't do this, man. I don't like surprises. Where do you think you're going? You again? Wow. Two ladies fighting over a janitor. - #... Far as I know, you're a freak # # Look nasty girl that shake her ass to the beat # - # To the beat, phat phat skee skee... # # 'Cause I'm ready for the girl, but she don't come cheap # # Aha, far as I know, you're a freak... # Come on, get up. Had enough? - Jake. Jake! - Huh? Are you just gonna stand there and watch? Hell yeah! Okay. Don't blink. Hey, babe, I don't think we're gonna make it. And you... you can use some hot cocoa and a nap. Come on. Easy. You! Hey hey, Jacuzzi. Do you have any idea what being locked in a trunk for eight hours does to a black woman's hair? I'm guessing not good, right? Mmm, you guess right. A sister is not happy if her hair is nappy, all right? You owe me a visit to my stylist Kiki over at the salon called "Hair This. " Why? 'Cause a sister needs to get her hair did. I want some highlights, and I'm thinking the highlights make a sister look a little more Latin. - Eh? - Latin? Ah! Okay, you got it. You know, yes, definitely. All right. Do you salsa? Ooh, he cute. Uh! What's up, fellas? There he is. There he is... Look, before you get started, man... ...Mr. Big Hotshot Video Game Maker. I can't believe you gave up your mop for this suit. Look, fellas, this was a really hard decision. I mean, not really, but if... for real... but I'll make us some good games and... G- g-games? I got game ideas. I've been holding them in. I'm gonna let 'em out. What... what about the one... "The Deadbeat Daddies. " The objective of the game is to avoid your baby mama... her legal team... you gotta keep switching your social security number, and they can't get a DNA sample. They take you on them talk shows about... "Look at his face, look at his eyes, look how much they look alike. " "Look how much they look alike. " That's how the game gonna say it... "Look how much they look alike. " - And you gotta avoid all that. - That's good, man, that's good. I heard it was based on a true story, too. - Ronnie, I'm gonna have to go, man. - Whoa, wait, whoa whoa, one more... what about the mad janitor versus the co-worker with the promotion? Yeah. I'll t... I'll track you down and... I mean, he... in the game... will track you down... - Hey, look... ... and he take care of you, and... and... and... and... and take you out. I'm... I w... I'm gonna call you, okay? Wait, I got, like, Just don't forget where you came from. Yeah, because the broom don't wait on nobody, baby. You understand? This is mop life, mop life! So sweep on! You think he liked my ideas? Oh, yeah yeah. Hey. How's the game? Eh, working on it. Level five's too damn easy, but, uh, we're tweaking it. Okay, we'll bring that up at Thursday's meeting. Thanks a lot, boss. I appreciate everything you've done for me. How about a raise? No. Oh. Just checking. I didn't think you was going to... Mmm? Hey, Jake, what's up? Hey, what are you doing here? Surprise! This is nice. Thank you. That's beautiful. Oh, wow. "'The Cleaner' Saves the Day! Love, Gina. " That's right, with the help of his waitress-slash-agent- slash-almost-Boo. How about... almost-getting-closer-Boo? Oh, really? I thought you just would have forgot about me. How could I forget about you? Technically, this is another time, another place. True. What are you thinking? Dinner and ice skating? Ice skating? On no! You are not getting me into those tight pants again. I was thinking more like moonlight under the stars in the Bahamas. Sounds pretty romantic. First class all the way. Sounds expensive. Why don't you let me worry about that? - Okay. - Come on. The waitress and the janitor take on the world. That's right. Uh... hold on. A spy's gotta eat, right? Eh? Let's spend some of this money. Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Oh, if you don't mind, could you pick me up a little box of kittens and a rainbow Afro? And if you could get my eighth-grade schoolteacher on the phone... I'd really like to talk to her. One other thing... some brown shoe polish with a little sponge tip. That's the kind I like. And a Simon and Garfunkel album... just the... just the album cover. I don't need the actual album. I mean, if it's no trouble. You can get yourself something nice, maybe some animal crackers or something. Maybe, like, a little sparkly... a little spinning hat or something with little... little helicopters on top. I'm sorry, Oprah, I can't take you to the Grammys, okay? You know why? 'Cause I need a dirty girl. Give me that. Stop! Okay? That causes shrinkage. Keep the freezie off the deezie. Enough with the ice on the dice. You gotta be real dirty. Can you be dirty? Can you be dingy? Can you not brush your teeth for me? I have a computer chick in my hotel? You have the hottest... - computer chick ever. - Computer chick in your hotel ever! Nobody... nobody's... ...but I can't even go in to pretend to give him a kiss? Nyah! You want me to take your temperature? That's right. All the dirty girls, make noise! "Please, Dirty Clean Rapper, be with me!" L... I'll think about it. Here we go. Ow! Ooh! Yeah! - Lower. - Do you think that's... Hey, lady! Take these. I'm going to still tell your wife. Your breath smells like sauted ass. ...like trash date. ...smells like hot garbage. Eww! I got two words for you... Al-toids! Lady, get your junk in the trunk! Are you the girl from "Charlie's Angels"?
