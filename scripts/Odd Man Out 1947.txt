Turn right to bring you to the back of Northumberland Street post office. Then drive straight across the parade ground to the park. - How is it, Johnny? - Fine. The orders haven't changed. - The weather's good. - Snow later but we'll be back by then. Dennis, I was saying we'll go the way we planned. Queen's Bridge, Bedford Street, Shaftesbury Square. It's a bit longer but it brings the car into a better position. There's no hurry. There's time for a cup of tea. - Is the car all right? - She's OK. - Is it a nice clean one? - With decent tyres? - I picked a good one. - One day, you might have your own! - I wouldn't mind having this one. - How much petrol? - Three gallons. - Half will do us. - We might have to... - No. We'll be back by five. I'll have the car there at twenty to. - I'll be on the bridge. - I'll be at the car sales room. - Any tea? - Everything settled? - Yes. They're leaving soon. - I heard that. - You hear everything. - Or I can put it together. - Pour in the milk. - Will he be coming back, me darling? I've watched you grow up and I know what's in your heart for that boy. Maybe you know what's in his heart too. - Did you sell me coupons? - No time to talk about that. I want three bob a piece for the clothing ones. You can have the meat ones if you give me a few points for me sweets. We're district managers making a report. Friday's their day. - What do managers talk about? - Oh...goods on order, export market. I'll be where we said with the pram. Has nothing changed? No. We'll be there, Maureen. You're to take the money to Hannigan. He'll distribute it. Right. No more worries till your man's out of prison. - A slice of the party cake. - A few crumbs of it won't go amiss. - Good luck. - Good luck, Maureen. We'd better be moving too. - Hold hard for a second. - I'll wait here for you. Nolan. Murphy. You've got to look like businessmen. - I wouldn't wear that. - I've got me coat. Go easy with those now. Anybody that asks for it can have it. Yes but don't... don't encourage them to ask. You don't want to start getting mixed up in shootings. - OK. - See you later. - Good luck, boys. - Good luck. Your...your heart's not in this job, Johnny. Is it? - I won't be sorry when we're back. - You don't believe in it? I believe in everything we're doing but violence is getting us nowhere. You? You were sentenced to 17 years for bringing in guns and ammunition, you talk about violence? In prison you have time to think. If only we could throw the guns away, make our cause in the parliaments. Johnny... Hiding in this house for six months since your escape from prison... it isn't the right kind of training for a job like this. You were in prison for eight months before that. It's been over a year since you were able to get out in the streets. You're not fit to go right out on a job like this. Let me go. Let him go, Johnny. Do I look soft then? Well, the men have noticed something. You've changed lately. They want me to go in your place. - Don't they trust me? - They trust you all right but... Dennis, I'm the leader of the organisation in this city. I've spent months planning this raid to get the funds we need, for Maureen and the others. I've got my orders and I'll see them through. When I want your advice, I'll ask for it. All right. I'll wait downstairs. - You haven't drunk your tea. - Don't you start worrying, Kathleen. It'll go fine. Thanks. Here. You haven't told me if you're remaining here. I'll be back but when the excitement ends, I'll make for the hills. - There are friends up there. - Shall I come and see you? Of course. Bring Granny. You've been a great friend, both of you, putting up with me while I've been hiding here. You've been very... Well, you know what I mean. Johnny, will you ever be free? Someday perhaps. I must go now. Thanks. Well... Do I look like a businessman? Don't worry, Kathleen. We'll be back in no time. Johnny, you've been stuck in this house for six months. You're not fit for it. Let Dennis go instead. Will you be here when I come back? Here we are now. - Harry Jermison, seven... - All right. Lay off your work. Back up there. Back up. Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Put your hands down. Have you not got these in yet? I say, stop! What are you doing in here? Stop! Stop! Stop! Get in! Hurry! Come on, Johnny! Come on! Come on. Get in! - Look out, Johnny! - Who are you? Get him in the car! Quick! - Look out! - Get him in, man! He's hit. Pat! Not so fast! Wait a minute! Wait till we get him in! Pull him in, can't ye? Slow down, he's slipping! Don't let him go! Stop, Pat! Johnny! Stop! Pull up, can't you? Pull up! The whole crowd of us will be lifted. Back up! Quickly! - Get out and fetch him. - He's dead. Yous told me to hold the car and now you just sit there. Go on, man! Reverse! Do we go back for him? If we cut down there, they'll be waiting for us. - Run back and look for him. - We'll pick him up at the corner. He'll be there ahead of us. I'm not staying here, it's too risky. - If you'd only backed the car! - Here's the street. Keep a lookout. Can you see him? No, he's not there. Get going. Go to Kathleen's house. He'll get there. - Here come the big shots! - All planned up to get Johnny McQueen! Can I have the thousand pound reward if I catch Johnny? - Alive or dead! - Here's chief of the cops. Do you want my identification card? I'm Johnny McQueen! All the police are looking for me! Murphy and Nolan had a hold of Johnny and they must have let go of him somehow because when I looked around, I seen poor Johnny lying in the road. I was going to back the car but he was up and away down the street. Why did you let go of Johnny? - Who said we let go? - Can you deny it? I took yous by the coal cart and that wasn't easy. Then I made the turn... - You took it too quickly! - And who let go of him? - We told you to slow down. - So I did slow down! If it wasn't for you, there'd have been no need. Johnny was wounded. At the turn, the door cracked his arm and he let go. - You mean you let go! - And what did you do then? - We kept telling you to stop. - You drove on for near 100 yards. - You did. - Tell him what you did. Before we could get out, Johnny got up. That's a lie! Yous fellas wouldn't stir out of the car! - That's enough. Give us the facts. - What's happened? That's it. They kept shouting at me to pull up the car, so I did pull up the car and they wouldn't get out. - You came back without Johnny? - I'm handling this. - Without your chief? - What do you know about it? - You weren't in the blooming car. - Their own chief and they left him. For heaven's sake, leave us alone. We done our best. Give us a drink or something. Give me the facts. Maureen, bring some tea. A drink of tea, is it, and a dose of poison. Oh, Donald, what a dream I had. What an outing. I dreamt I'd escaped from prison. I dreamt I was on a raid, robbing a mill... funds for the organisation. I remember I wasn't feeling so good. I hadn't felt so good ever since I'd escaped from here. After we'd done the job, there was a fight and I shot a man. Yes. I dreamt I shot him. And I couldn't get onto the car. Somehow I couldn't get onto it. That's right. I was wounded in the left arm. I fell off, then got up and ran... along streets... afraid. Afraid I'd killed him. And then I came to an air-raid shelter... slumped down... I must have passed out. All right. There may be an inquiry into this. - Inquiry? What about? - We didn't finish it off right. - That's poor thanks. - Kathleen, get some bandages. - We did our best. - What's the bandages for? I'm going to look for Johnny. They may take me for him. - The police will be out in force. - You've no chance. "Armed raid on mill. Cashier killed in struggle. "Wounded assailant still at large." Killed? Poor Johnny. May heaven protect him. Pat, Nolan, Murphy, get to headquarters. Go the back way. Dennis, may I go with you? No. Tell headquarters so they can take action. - Right you are. - Good luck. Do you think this will deceive them? The police are looking for a wounded man. They may take me for Johnny. - It'll give him a chance to get away. - By yourself? They don't know he's there. Too many will attract attention. For a long time now, there's been no serious trouble but tonight the police will be everywhere. - Take a few men with you. - No. It's better this way. - Take somebody you can trust. - Come on, finish it. Dennis...let me come with you. - Why? - It's something I want to do. Something for yourself and not the organisation. Sooner or later the police will get him. Let me have him until then. As long as he lives, he'll belong to the organisation. - Always the organisation. - Yes. - Wait here in case he comes back. - There's Granny. Stay here. Could I see your identity card, please? Right. Thank you, now. Identity card? Thank you. Come on. Through here. - Pat! Where are you taking us? - Theresa's house. - There'll be trouble if we go there. - Just till the road's clear. - What else are we to do? - Go to headquarters. - Go on, you, and try! - Come on! Come on! We're in trouble enough without asking for more. She'll give us a drink or something and a bite to eat maybe. - I wouldn't trust her. - You wouldn't trust nobody. - Don't you worry. - Steps like the mill. Keep your mouth shut about that. Just keep it shut. - Theresa, how are ye? - Pat, Murphy and Nolan. Come in. Give me your coats and hats. Come in and let me see you. I'm away to me mother's, Pat. Sorry, Theresa, I can't stay. - He was in a terrible hurry. - We just dropped in for a minute. You're not leaving without having a drink? Give me your coats. It's barely six and plenty of time for something to eat. For your own peace of mind, you'd better keep these handy. Come on into the warm. In here. Come on. - Somebody will see us, Lenny. - It's all right here, Molly. - No. I... - What's wrong? I don't want to. You said you would. Yes, I know but I've changed my mind. Anyway, Lenny...I've got a sty. I haven't seen you for two days. Where else can we go? You'll see, Lenny. We'll have a place of our own. Lenny, there's somebody here. No. There is somebody. Put it out! Clear off! It's that fella - Johnny. Lenny. Lenny, come on. You'd better not get mixed up in this. The fella came rushing out shooting. Got Johnny in the left shoulder. We dragged him onto the running board but he fell off. Aye, and wasn't I saying to Dennis that Johnny wouldn't be fit for it? Have they found poor Johnny, tell me? Did the police find him or is he safe with friends? - He's safe enough. - Is he still down near the mill? Aye. Dennis will be able to get a hold of him somehow. Dennis, is it? There's no better man for a job like this. Drink up, Pat. It's good stuff. All they'd give us is tea. lmagine? Tea. - Where was that? - Kathleen's house. A little music will cheer you. I'll get a meal ready and then we can put our feet under the table and eat. We want to watch what we tell her. - Whatever she knows, you told her. - You told her about Dennis going down. For heaven's sake, man, pipe down, leave a fella take a drink in peace. Get out. Police headquarters. lnspector, this is Theresa O'Brien speaking. I know Theresa like I know a bad sixpence. She's right as rain. Plenty of dough too. Here...go on. Have a smoke. Go on, she's on the house. Ah. Of course, there's people says queer things about her sometimes... but they say queer things about me too. Jealous, you know? The town's full of it. I dare say she'll lay down a good feed for us fellas and a wee spot of booze too. She's an old chancer mixed up with every racket in the city. Smuggling, moneylending - squeezing the blood out of the poor. Is that so? And you can sit there warming your... Maybe we shouldn't have come. We'll take what's here and what else is to come then we'd better be going. Aye. You're always saying I'm a bad one and agin the law. I'm proving now that I'm always willing to help the police. I know there's a big reward for this but I...I'm not thinking of that. These boys have told me where Johnny is and somebody's looking for him. We'll talk about that later on. Why, I wouldn't like any trouble in this house, lnspector. I see. Well, in a few moments, I'll do me best to get them out of here. Yes...thanks. - A bell. - You brought us here... - Stop. Listen. - I'm off. Stay where you are. Don't be a fool. Let her come in. Put away that thing, man. You're terrible. You do nothing without you've a load of booze inside you. Leave us a spoonful. Put your coat on. If she starts any of her tricks, I'll make her pay for it. Let her try. When she comes into the door, I'll give her a right good fright. - Go easy. - Shut up. I just got word on the telephone. The police are heading this way. Go before they lift you. If you don't go now, things will go bad for you. Stop flourishing them things. Must I tell you what to do? Out you go now. Run for it. There are three steps. All right, ye are! So come on! - Are they killed? - I heard them running past me house and now there they are. Get the place cleared. Go on, sonny. You said they'd sent someone to look for Johnny McQueen. Where are they looking? Go inside, then I'll join you. I'm Johnny McQueen! - Who are you? - I'm Johnny! - Give him a kick in the face! - Give him a kick! Go on, Johnny. Shoot him. Bang! Bang! Hey, mister! Give us a penny. - Give us a penny. - Go on, beat it. - I'll call the police. - No police around here. - What? - There's no police here. Have you not seen the police up the street? - Give us a penny. - There's no police here. They're looking for that fella that killed the man. - Give us a penny. - They've gone. - Did you see them? - Or give us a cigarette. - But they were here? - They were but they went back. - Sure? - Quite sure. - Mister, give us a penny. - Did they find the man? - They'll never find Johnny. - He escaped in the car. - Mister, give us a penny. - Give us a penny. You sure they didn't find the man who killed the fella? - Quite sure. - D'you know where Johnny is? No. We don't know. Did you see him? Did you? The man? Where was he? In a house? In a shelter? Which one? Show me. Take me to it. Come on, be a good girl. Show me. Did the police take him away? Did he run away? The police never came? Johnny? - Did I kill that man? - Can you walk? Did I? Can you stand up? Grip my arm. Can you walk? Come on, man. Come on. That's fine. You're not too bad at all. That's fine. Come on. You hear that? They've got to know you're down here. I'll cut off to the left and draw them off. When you hear three shots... Are you listening, Johnny? When you hear three shots, make for the house. It's a long way. It's our only chance. You'll get through. Come away now. Stand near the door here. Wait for three shots, your coast'll be clear and then be off. Good luck. Dennis, did I kill that fellow? Joe. Come along. Clear the platform, please. Right down the centre of the car, please! Make a bit of room for the orphans of the storm! - Oh, start her up again! - Pull the cord. Fares, please. How are you, Mrs McCluskey? - What's holding us up? - The car's overloaded. Chuck some off. - Take your face outside. - Back to your wheels. Some of you can get out and push. Come on, clear the platform! I've brought something hot for you. Here's the police. Come in and warm yourself, Constable. Come on, get off the tram. Come on, please! It hit him! - Are you badly hurt? - Get an ambulance. - I'll be all right. - Come indoors. We know all about first aid. We were in the ARP. We've got bandages. Can you come in? Maudie, I've got your umbrella. - His arm's broken. - Don't be so dramatic. The book said keep calm. Fetch a basin and a kettle of water. It was boiled, so it's sterilised. - His arm's broken. - Who did the first aid? I did the ARP and I'm saying his arm's broken. You failed your practicals. Get the water and the first aid box. You'll see when his coat's off. - Oh, my goodness. - Can I stay here? It's quiet. - Maudie? - Yes? - This fellow's badly hurt. - I told you it was broken. - Maudie... - Oh. Help me off with his coat. Can you...? That's right. There now. Sit down. - Give me the scissors. - What are you going to do? You shouldn't do that without asking him. - It's the way they told us. - But whose jacket is it? The troubles you make. I'm only warning you that it's his jacket. - Look at your hands. - What? - Germs. Go and wash them. - Oh, fuss, fuss, fuss. Anyway, they told us that the air was full of germs. Can you sit up? I want to take your coat... Maudie... You see to it. Don't bring a doctor. I wouldn't interfere with that. - He needs the hospital. - Of course. Look at him. - Help me up. - Lay quiet. We'll bring a doctor. - No... - Just lay easy. Rest. I must be on my way back. I can't stay here. They're waiting for me. Get a glass of water. Listen, son... You've been badly hurt by that lorry. - I'm going to send for the doctor. - Don't do that. Is there someone we can fetch to help you? Your wife, maybe? Or a friend. If you send to her, she might... If she could, she would. Is it your wife, son? - Who, then? - Some friends. Where do they live? I'll send Maudie for them. We're new to this town but we'll find them somehow. I'll just slip on my coat. Where do they live? What's the address? I can't bring them out tonight. Why should I be the one to bring you in? What will my husband say when he sees you? Give us a hand up and I'll go. Stay there. What'll I do with you? It said in the papers that he was wounded and got away. - You're right. It's him. - Chief of the organisation. Did that fellow die? Did I kill him? Rosie, what'll we do with him? I can't hand him over to the police - not as he is, - lying there, near dead. - Nor can I, Rosie. - There's a reward out for him. - A thousand pounds. - I wouldn't lay a finger on it. - No more would I. There's Tom. What'll Tom do? Tom will do his duty. He'll go to the police. - Not thinking of the reward. - But he'll be in the way of getting it. Now, Rosie. Bit late tonight. Got stopped by the police at the end of the road. This mill business. Tom... There's something I... We found this fellow outside. - What's happened to him? - Come here. I'll tell you. Listen, Tom. We'd just been out for a few minutes getting the rations... Who is that fella? - That's Johnny McQueen. - I know, Tom. - Put him back where you fetched him. - We can't. - How did he get here? - He was laying on the road. - Did any of the neighbours see? - No. - Sure? - Quite sure. - He's the chief of the organisation. - I'm thinking about what he is now. And I'm thinking of the decent man he killed! I've no pity for them, - murdering innocent men. - But he's dying, Tom. - Let me send Maudie for his friends. - There's a police cordon. - You wouldn't treat a dog like that. - Are those fellas our friends? I don't know, Tom. Maybe not. He's not long for this world. Call the police then or take him to hospital. - Not giving a dying man peace. - It's sense. - Sense is cruel. - I respect the law. There's a police cordon round here. We'll be in it too! All right! Put him out. You're the master! Shh! Quick. I'm going now. The thing is settled for you and you won't have to worry. What are you going to do? Open the door and I'll go out and never trouble you again. Here. Hold on a minute. Close the door when I'm gone... and forget me. - What about...? - Drop it in the drain. Rosie. Good luck, lad. Hurry up! I've got wet enough as it is without being splashed by your plates of meat. A little of that won't hurt you. You all right, chum? There's no driver. - Come on, Harry! - I think the chap's hurt. - Or he's tight! - Tight? Are you? Let's have a sniff. Oh, lovely. You're right! He's had a drop. Ask him where he got it! Where'd you get it, eh? All right, mate? - Our tram! - There's our tram! Come on, get up. Identity cards. - What's the matter? - Chap trying to get out. I've been trying to get out for five years. - Have you not caught him? - I think he's out of the district. - Who have you got in the back? - In the back? Johnny. All right, Gin. On your way. Get on with it. Get up. - Peelers. - Sit down. Let them in but don't talk. Like some poor old creature with no spirit? - I could hold them with my eloquence. - Now give them a taste of silence. There's a gun upstairs. I'd better get rid of it. - We've orders to search your house. - Then get on with it. - Who are you? - I live here. - Who occupies this room? - My father. Wait downstairs. It's a fine, brave sight, our James. They'll never think of searching me. Where is he? My father's out. I wasn't asking you about your father. Come on. I know they've been here. Smoking cigarettes and drinking tea, the whole bunch of them. I had friends in to see me. The fellows who raided the mill. You were all wondering how you could find Johnny McQueen. It was about Johnny. I can tell you nothing. You were making plans how you could find him. That's the truth. What do you want in this house? He's gone too far this time for any of you to help him. Finish your work here and get out and leave us in peace. We're not after him for taking a shot at us or for blowing out the windows of a barracks with explosives. This time he has shot and killed a man. - You know what that means. - It's his concern. - And yours. - I'm not responsible for him. You're responsible for what goes on in this house. I warn you, if there's any evidence found here, it will go very hard with you unless you help us now. - What do you want me to say? - I want the truth, that's all. - You want to know where Johnny is? - Mm-hm. - I'm ready. - There's nothing upstairs. Take a look around here. Stand up, old girl. Give them to me. Them's my sweets. All right. You can sit down now. Whose coat is that you're wearing? - It belongs to my father. - He hasn't lived here for two years. I put it round me when I'm cold. Are you often cold? You shouldn't be with a crowd always in the house. These didn't help Johnny. Or Dennis. All right. I'll join you later. - You've searched and found nothing. - I've found all that I came to find. - The bandages and the jacket? - More than that. - There was nothing more. - There was. Something that you couldn't hide. - I'm not afraid because of that. - He belongs to the law now. It might be easier for you if you could bring yourself to realise that. If you don't and you try to help him, you'll be in trouble. Stay out of this business. That wasn't a bad fella as them fellas goes. - He spoke fair. - Give it to me, Granny. There was decency in him. He spoke sense. - Give me the revolver. - What he said was true. - Let me have what I want. - Sure, you'll never find Johnny. I've seen the men go out like he did and the women go look for them but they never found them. Stay here, darlin'. Where's the sense in running towards trouble if you can't mend it? Look at me there. That was me on me wedding day. I was 1 9 then and as lovely as yourself. I had the fine looks the same as you have them now. I had the boys admiring me. There was Hughie Fitzpatrick - he wanted to marry me. He was a rebel on the run and was never seen again. Did I go out to look for him? I did not! I stayed and had me life and grand times I had with Frankie and the rest of them saying I was an angel of God. Grand times, thanks be to God. And the voices of the fine boys singing the songs. And I had 11 children, so I had. Fine boys and girls, all of them. Colm and Frankie... And the spirit of them. See you home, madam? Cab, sir? Cab, sir? See you home, madam? Cab! Cab! Right, sir. Be with you right away. Get up. There's somebody inside, Jack. You've already got a fare. The man's drunk. I'll soon get the heads and tails of this. - Out you get. - Take your hand away. Oh, it's you. And I drived you through the police cordon in my cab. - Carry on the way you're going. - I can't, man! I'm not for you or against you but I can't afford to get mixed up in this. Hey, you! Get along there. Yes, Constable. Right away, Constable. Come on, son. You'll be all right here. Listen, son. If you get back to your friends, tell them I helped you - me, Gin Jimmy. But if the police get you, you won't mention my name, huh? I saw you, Gin. Is he hurt bad? You keep out of this, Shell. Get away. But why ask me? He's got lots of his own crowd. - But will you help? - It's an awful risk, Kathleen. - What time are you leaving? - Eleven. It's only eight now. I'll go to Father Tom. He might know something. Yes. He usually hears things. If you do find him, you won't get through the way you came. Bring him by Dock Square. I'll see the gate at the clock tower is open. Good. I'll be here before eleven. Out for a little walk, I suppose? I'm glad you're keeping out of this business. It's a nice place. I thought you might have stayed. You're wasting your time. Father Tom can't help you. - You're going in then? - Yes. Why don't you go home? There, go in if you want to. But you're too late, miss. - Is Father Tom in? - He is but somebody's with him. Will ye come in a moment? - You came to ask me about Johnny. - Do you know him? I taught him as a child. I know them all. I was expecting people to come inquiring. I've another visitor. A poor man whose little bird is sick. We'd better hear what he's got to say first. This is my other visitor. His name is Shell. You are? - Kathleen Sullivan. - How are you, miss? He's having trouble with his bird. D'you see this wee creature? He's a rare one. It's a budgie. There are thousands. There's millions of men and women but there's rare ones among us. Like this bird. He has a chief. A devil of a fella. Always making mischief. - Just like some fellas does. - What's his name? Me and Lukey and Tober - them's the friends that I live with, the three of us calls him Johnny. I must tell you, miss, Johnny is what you call a menace to society. We have a rule saying that the door of his cage must be kept shut because there's other birds in my room besides Johnny and he can't stand them and they can't stand him. There's a sort of difference of opinion, like, between them. - The bird's almost human! - How bad is he? I tell you, he gets out of his prison... his cage, I mean, and off he goes. But he's back now. You have him. What happened when he got away? Murder. D'you see his left wing? It's hurt. Poor fella. He gets out and does mischief. Killing one fella in the struggle. But the one he killed contrived to sort of give him a dig and there it is - a spot of blood. How did you manage to capture him again? Oh, I got word from a friend and got me hands on the bird. - And he's hurt bad. - How is he now? Well, this corner that he's laying in... it's not the sort of place for him to sit up proper. Perhaps he's not long for this world. There isn't a sound out of him. If he's that badly wounded, perhaps nature should take her course. Father Tom, I'd hate for to let the bird slip out of me grasp. It's a hard world, Father - I don't mind telling you - and I want the bird because there's money in him. My son, it's a hard world, a very hard world. It's fierce. I know there's praying and all that but if I don't take what's coming to me as chances, I'd just starve. Poor fellow. - What will you do with him? - I've told you. I want to get him out of the corner - and put him right. - And after that? There's lots of people that'll pay me a grand price for Johnny. - The police? - I'm not referring to them. I'm thinking of the friends he must have. - Where is he? - Don't blame him. He's got to live. - But not telling us where he is. - I've told you he's in the corner. If he knows where he is, we must trust him. Tell me, what price are you asking for him? Well...I could get a thousand for him. You foolish man. Money wouldn't make you happy. I'm only telling you what I could raise on him if I had a mind to. We'll get you a little something but not 1,000. All that money would be a terrible burden. First of all, where is he? - Bring him to us. - That's what I was waiting to hear. But, Father, it won't be an easy job, you know. - No but you'll try. - I will, I will. But I'm still thinking and wondering... how much you're...? I'm a poor man. I've got no money. Oh, that's bad. Oh, but it might be the young lady here, she could lend you a bit. I'm sure she couldn't. Oh, well, listen... A fella was telling me the he heard tell that His Reverence the Pope is rich. - Blather. - Blather? - Is that a fact? - It is just blather. How do you suggest that we should settle this matter decently? If you like, I'll try to inspire in you a precious particle of faith. Faith? Would it pay the rent and help me to get a pint of stout now and then? Shell, you and I are poor men. We must live the best we can. I've been poor longer than you have. Bring back Johnny and I'll show you the way to get real riches. We'll talk about the way to live and then there'll be a fine reward for you. Still the bit of faith? But what is the value of it in hard cash? Trust me. Bring Johnny back and we'll settle it all. Now, will yer? Aye, I will. I will. - No, miss. I'll bring him. - You stay here. - Well, my child? - Father... When Shell returns... give Johnny to me. - It's not for me to give him away. - Why is he coming here? Shell says he's wounded, maybe dying. I want to hear his confession and do what I can to comfort his soul. - And afterwards? - I'll ask him to give himself up. - Father... - What do you want me to do, child? Take him back so that he can kill more people and defy the authorities? So that I can take him away and be with him. You will never hear of him again, I promise. - But you couldn't hide him for long. - I've done it before. This is different. He's killed a man and he must pay the penalty. Rather than that, I'd take his life myself. Child, you mustn't say such things. Why, Father? The law would do it for revenge. I only do it out of pity. Have you thought what would happen to you? I shall go with him. Kathleen. You don't know what you're saying. If he's arrested, I'll have to live while he's on trial, while he's being executed. And afterwards for all the years of my life. Kathleen, there's a little glove for putting on the coals. Can you see it? Listen. When people are in deep trouble, they often say to me they'll kill themselves and they mean it at the time. But when everything seems lost, God gives them the courage to win. It's not for myself that I'm afraid. Why then? I'm afraid for him if he should die alone. When men were against him, I protected him. If I go with him, perhaps I can protect him again. Listen, Kathleen. This life is nothing but a trial for the life to come. You're being tested now and if you want real happiness for Johnny and yourself, you'll face your ordeal and win your own heaven. You're wise, Father, good, I know. I want to listen to you but I can't. I can't take it in. I only know that what I feel is stronger than my religion, stronger than myself. Kathleen, where's your faith? My faith is in my love. You have neither the power nor the right to do this thing. I believe that what I intend to do is good. - Did you see who came in? - Yes. Keep quiet. Ha'pence change. - Mr Fencie... - Quiet. - Who is that fellow? - It's Johnny. Get on with your work. Let Charlie chuck him out before there's trouble. And what would happen if his friends found out? - What do we do then? - You carry on. Come on. Take this and get out of here. I need to stay and rest. I'll go when you close. You're not going to rest here. Come on. You're wasting good stuff. Get out of here. Pull yourself together. - Shall we run him out? - No. Wait till closing time. Then get rid of him. Keep your eye on here. Serve number four. Shell! - That you, Shell? - I'm going out. I have business. Ah! I've got it. That's right. You be good birds, you be good birds. - Ah, Shell, dear. - Lukey! Lukey! Shell! - I need you. - Lukey! Look, Lukey, I have important business matters, Lukey. Look, you see? It's not right. I haven't got what I wanted, have I? - Oh, you're at it again, Lukey. - It's the eyes. Why don't paint a nice jug and some apples like the other fellas? - Sit down, Shell. - But... - It'll take a couple of minutes. - It's always a couple of minutes, stretching to hours in this blasted chair! One day you'll die, Shell, but this picture will live. Lukey...Lukey, I have important business matters. Lukey, I know where Johnny McQueen is hiding. I know where I can lay hands on him. And, Lukey, he's hurt bad. He can't move. - What's that you say? - I went to Father Tom. Him and me agreed on terms. Nothing definite, no promises, but a rich thing, a particle of something - very precious. What have you been up to, you sneaking little rat?! Lukey, dear! There's hundreds of police out to get Johnny and what was the wrong in me diddling him out of harm and putting him into the palm of the hand of mercy? - You! - Lukey! - I only asked... - Selling a human being! Lukey, he goes to the right buyer. - How much did he offer? - There was no exact figure. - How much? - Negotiations was left open! Liar! I'm going to hit you hard for trying to sell a man. Lukey, don't. I know where Johnny is at this minute. Let me take him to Father Tom. - I'm going to hit you unless... - What? You bring him here for me to paint. That's a desperate thing you're asking. What about his friends? Then you can do what you like with him. - Do what I tell you. - It'd take too long. Just head and shoulders. There'll be something in his eyes, something more than all my failures have. - I don't know. - Don't you? - Then I'll break your little neck. - Lukey, let go of me. - Yes or no? - I want to think over me plans... I said, yes or no? Well...yes. If you don't bring him here, I'll hit you hard where it hurts. Yes. But if you do bring him here, then I may, I may find some good in you after all. Now look, I'll have everything ready. You dirty little...! Shell! I'm not running any risks for the fun of putting up models for you, my boy! Are there faces in the fire, Lukey? Hundreds of them, Tober. Beautiful ones, ugly ones. Smiling...glaring at me. Men and women, one after another, telling me things, shedding tears. But they don't stay. Oh, Tober, dear, if I could only get just one of them... Go and get yourself a drink, Lukey. Oh, thank you, Tober. Johnny. Johnny, Johnny, I've fixed it for you. Johnny. Johnny? Johnny! Look out where you're going! Shell! Have a drink, Shell. Have a drink. - How's business? - My best bird has flew. - Too bad, too bad. - Aye. I'm looking for him. - What sort of bird is he? - Mr Fencie, he's hurted. In the left wing. Do you think you'll find him on a wild night like this? I'm halfway to him already. - Is that so? - I know where he is at this minute. - Why don't you catch him then? - No hurry. No hurry. He's in a corner. Can't get out. What would you do if you had him? I'd sell him. He's a prize creature, wounded or sound. Suppose, now...just suppose, like, you didn't find him at all, what would you do then? I'd go to the police, Mr Fencie. I see. I wish you luck. Would you give me a hand to get him away? Wait here a minute. Look out. - Large whisky. - Hello, Lukey. How's the art? Listen to them all yap yap about a man who committed a murder. The police want him but you're all afraid of him but I'm not. - I'd look into his eyes. - Then what? I'd paint him and the truth of life and death. - Like those of yours up there? - That muck? Beer money. Hold on! Who are you! What do you want? What are these people doing here? - I wouldn't interfere with that. - He needs the hospital. Didn't I bring you through the police cordon in my cab? Come on, get out! You all right, chum? Oh, you're tight. - Who are these people? - I'll wait for you, Johnny... There's that little rat! Time, gentlemen, please! Time! Let me get at him! Let me get my hands on the wretch! You...! That's enough. Get out of there. Get out! Night, ladies. Good night, good night. - Good night, good night. - Good night. - Give me a couple of those. - Where's the money? Put it on my account. You must be feeling a bit tired after all your exertions. The damage will amount to about 25 quid, I think. - What suggestions have you got? - I have no money. No! But plenty of talent for smashing up the place! It's the police for you this time. The last time you had a small artistic difference, I forgave you - this time, it's a little more serious. - I must send for the police. - 25. I'm a painter, not a publican. - Pay up or go to prison. - I'm pinched financially. - Then it's six months in jug. - Have your revenge. I've got a proposition to make. Yes. A couple of my pictures will square it. - No. An alternative. - What? You'll see. The police or my proposition? I'm too busy for six months' holiday in prison. - Then it is my proposition? - Yes. Joe, tell Bill to bring his cab here. Over here. - Sam, give us a hand. - What a picture you've painted. He's going to make good that mischief. But it's Johnny. - Yes. It's him all right. - How are you? I've ordered a cab. The driver won't ask any questions. - What do you want me to do? - Get rid of him. Tip him out somewhere away from here. Here's ten bob for the cab. Make up your mind. Get out of here. Sam, give us a hand. - It'll be ten years if we're caught. - He's for the road. There's only one road for him. Wait here. - The street's empty, the cab is here. - My bottles. My beer. See if the police are about. - But, Mr Fencie... - Shut up! - If the police see us... - Shut up. Open that door. Thank you. Lukey, come on, outside. Come on, come on. - A little brandy for the journey? - Outside. Go on, go on. Come on. Get him in there. Go on. - Be careful with him. - Then give us a hand. Get in. Hurry up. - Take it away. - Stop! Have you no manners? Go on! When I get you home, I'll give you a drink. And a friend of mine, he'll fix your arm for you. Tober... Oh, Tober. Tober? Tober, is this serious? When you were a student in that university in London, did you learn about things like this? Am I hurt bad, eh? No. I thought I might have been. Fish and chips. Good nourishing food, Tober. Ne'er one for poor Shell. I'm desperate hungry. You're a decent man, Tober. Tober. Tober, a bad thing has happened. You won't be cross if I tell yer? You won't, will yer? - Lukey was terrible cross. - Well? Well, I...I found where Johnny McQueen was hiding. - Go on. - And I... I took and I went to Father Tom. - To get your dirty bit of profit? - I have to live. - Shell, you are foul. - Father Tom never said so. He was decent. I told him that I had to live and he sort of agreed with me. Of course, he has no fortune but he hinted he had something else. It's faith, precious particle - something he has by him. That's where I've lost. It might have glorified your miserable soul. Tober...what does it mean? Faith? I knew one man had it. I wonder how Father Tom would have given me a bit of it. - What is it, Tober? - It's life. I've got him. It's Johnny. - Put him over by the fire. - Oh, no. It's his shoulder. He's in a bad way. Boil up some water quickly. Bring a clean bowl and a piece of carbolic soap. - Bring that case from my room. - I know. All them silver scissors. - What's this you're up to? - Look at him. All the people I've painted were living but he's different. He's near death. He sees it. He's dying. I don't need to be told that. There are wonderful thoughts in his eyes. - You madman. - Won't take long. After I've fixed him up, he's going to hospital. You know who he is. If he gets there soon, he might live. - His life is lost already. - Not my concern. Patching up his body so he can be tried and executed. I can't help that. There's more to be considered than the body. That may be dying but the soul is still alive. Tober, are you going to operate? Bring the hot water, fetch a clean towel. Have you got the stuff that makes the hospital smell? Get those things. You'll keep out of the light, won't you, Tober? Why do you want to do this? Because there's something to be said about him before he dies. - And about all of us. - I can see it, Tober. You might find something you don't understand that'll frighten you. - I understand what I see in him. - What is it? - It's the truth about us all. - Is that all? - He's doomed. - So are we all. - Is he really dying, Tober? - We're all dying. Could you not fix him up so he could walk home? I'd see him safe along the road. Maybe I'd go with him. Shell, in my room there's some brandy. Bring it. Aye. That'll give him the strength. Father, it's an inspector. Where will I go? You stay here. I'll see him downstairs. - Hello, Fred. - Father. I just wanted a few words. I've a visitor upstairs. Come into the vestry. Thank you. I know what you've come to talk about. - It's a serious matter, Father. - Johnny McQueen's doings. And Kathleen Sullivan was seen entering your house. There's nothing against her, surely? In the eyes of the law, she's dangerous. - I've been listening to her. - She asked you where to find Johnny? - That's a crime? - A serious one. From your experience of men and women, would you say they're all bad? In my profession, there is neither good nor bad. There is innocence and guilt, that's all. I've seen the bad in them and would condemn that, and rightly too, but what do we do when we find something that is good in them? Shouldn't we recognise that? I know what you're saying. This woman loves McQueen. She can't find him, so she comes to you to ask for help. All the people here expect me to do miracles. Father, I have my duty to do. Where is this man McQueen? Out there amidst the stones of the city. Is that all you have to tell me? You all come asking my assistance but I wanted to see him for a reason. - Why? - You'll think it strange but I wish I could've seen him before his arrest. I wanted so much to comfort him. That isn't unreasonable, Father, but you can't do that unless he's coming here. I'll have the streets watched and, Father, don't interfere. Oh, I wasn't interfering. I was only just wondering if there mightn't be a little mercy. It's my duty to bring this man to justice. That's the duty of all of us. Father, it might be better if that young woman stayed here with you. - You understand. - Good night. The young lady left. She said she couldn't stay. - Where did she go? - She didn't say. It's time you were in bed, Father. Wait a little longer. The tide's dropping. By midnight, the ship will be grounded. He'll be at Father Tom's any minute. Get him here by midnight. I can't do a thing after that. I'll get him before then. Aye, you'd have been a great doctor, Tober, if only you'd finished your studies. You'd have had a top hat and fine clothes and a big house and rich customers coming to you to be cured. And you wouldn't have to get out of bed till ten in the morning when the streets would be sort of aired. Easy now. Easy. He's ready for hospital now, Lukey. Give me a hand with him. - He'd better rest a bit longer. - He must have a blood transfusion. - What good is that? - It might save his life. - He's not fit to be moved. - Your infernal paintings! - Give him a brandy. - While the life dribbles out of him! The pot calling the kettle black! You don't care a pin about him. Yammering about his body and his soul. He has an immortal soul. He must go to hospital. Make up your mind about him quick. I'm not going to stand any nonsense from you fellas! Do you think I dressed his wounds so you could paint him? You only fixed him up to be proud of what you've done! - If he dies... - Give him peace to do it in then. And what if he does? What do we tell the police? I will not allow him to sit there and die in that chair! Aren't you going to hand him over to the priest? They'll keep him there. When he's fit, the police will put him up for trial. - You expect me to hide him? - He should stay here. It won't take me much longer... - Can't you see...? - I see life. Have you ever heard tell of Father Tom? Father Tom. - The old priest at St Catherine's? - That's him. Where is he? Tell me, Father, like you used to tell us. The police will put him on trial. I tell you, he should stay here. Louder, Father. I can't hear you. Let him rest. - Can't you see...? - What I see is life. - Now come on. - No, leave him. Look. We've always drowned your voice with our shouting, haven't we, Father? We never really listened to you. We repeated the words without thinking what they meant. But I remember when I was a boy... I remember. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I understood as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity, I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. Though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faiths so that I could remove mountains and have not charity... I am nothing. He's mad. He's out of his mind. He's delirious. I'm going to fetch an ambulance. Father Tom is waiting for you. There's a young lady named Kathleen with him. Could you get as far as Father Tom's if I gave you a hand? Shell! Come on now. You're doing fine. Step it out. That's the lad. Step it out. That's it. That's right, son. - Show me the way. - Right, Johnny. Come on. That's the boy. That's right. Come on, Johnny. Come on. That's right. You're doing fine. Come on. Stay there, Johnny. So as I was saying... This fella says to me if you bring the bird round to me next week... Come on. Johnny, come on. Come on. It's all right, Johnny. Come on, it's all right. Johnny, listen to me. You stay here. I'll get past the police and I'll bring Father Tom to you. Stay there, Johnny. It's a hardy old night, Sergeant. Where is he? - I left him safe a wee bit back. - Where? - Just before the square. - Take me there. - The police are all around. - Don't! Wait! - I have to tell Father Tom. - Tell him we've gone to the square. Aye, that's right. Me shoelace is busted. Me shoe's come off. A sock full of snow and ice! Johnny. Kathleen. - Is it really you? - Come to me and see. I can't. If you are real, stretch out your hand to mine. What d'you want with me? Go back to life and peace. I'll stay with you, my love. Hold up your head. Don't cry. That's our chance. Will you take it with me? - Is it far? - Keep hold of my hand. - Father Tom. My shoe came off. - Where is she? - The lace busted. She went on. - Which way? I couldn't keep up with her. Kathleen, where are you? It's all right, Johnny. I'm here. Is it far? It's a long way, Johnny, but I'm coming with you. We're going away together. There's their gun, sir. - Two shots fired. - That's when we had to fire back.
