Relationships never last in my family. Could it be genetic? And why put your heart out there just to be broken? I learnt that lesson often and early. And this is where I had my first kiss. Behind P.S. 53 at recess with Tommy Nolan. Who pushed me off the swings when the other boys made fun of him. I sprained my wrist and chipped two teeth. This one is called "Love hurts." I've been revisiting my life lately. Through my art. Yeah, I see that. And it's very interesting, but umm... Oh, you should also mention that I am opening my own art studio here in San Francisco later this month. I hate to stop you, but I think you've confused me for someone else. Aren't you a critic? But you said you were a critic. Back there someone said "everybody's a critic" and I agreed. You just assumed. Oh, oh. I work around the corner, actually, and I saw the crowd. And to be honest, I saw you, and... I'm sorry if I disappointed you. No, no, I'm not disappointed. It's the public's opinion that really matters. Just for fun, though, if you were a critic...? Oh, you don't want to hear my opinion. I'm just a guy off the street. Well, what? You don't like the photos? No, no, I do. They're um, they're all in focus. I'm sure they'd be great for someone. I'm sorry, this isn't coming out right. They're really nice. And clearly I was aiming for nice. I hate to do this, but I actually have to get to work. The best of luck with everything. Seriously. Hey, roomie. I definitely need to come to more of these gallery openings. Champagne, free food. Cute guys. See anything you like tonight? Now that you mention it... I think he means something that's for sale. What, the art? Way out of my league. Excuse me, waiter! So... how's business over here? Well, no one seems to be much impressed by photography these days. It's all the digital cameras and photo programs. When everybody can do something it stops being so special. Not that everybody can do what you do. Oh God, that came out so wrong. No, no, I know what you mean, sadly. Well, gotta go. 3:00. Polo shirt, perfect hair. So not interested. C'mon, it's been months, hasn't it? The whole "Love" thing is just so depressing. I mean, who needs it? Me, for one. How do I look? Well, I'm guessing 'desperate' isn't the look you're going for. Don't wait up. Sorry to keep you waiting. Oh, it's you. "Chloe Davenport, Moments in Time"? So this is the place around the corner? Gabe Sinclair. I really put my foot in it earlier, didn't I? Did you? I didn't notice. Yeah, um, let me make it up to you. A drink on the house. Soda water? Soda water it is! A little wild. I may need to see some i. d. I like your photos. Yeah, it's the city over the years. Customers seem to like it. Lime? Too crazy? So tell me, what was it about my work? The truth. I can take it. I don't know. All those pictures of a bench, fences. The full spectrum of human emotion. Well, excuse me but I find beauty in everyday objects. And there's nothing wrong with that. I happen to prefer people. It's hard to cozy up to a wall. Excuse me, can you top me up? Sure. Ah well, at least the wall's always there for you. Sorry? Nothing. I did it again, didn't I? Sorry. I'm not that good with first impressions. I'm waiting. Just, excuse me. Y'think? Are you interested in anything in particular? Just looking. You never know. No, you never do. What's all this? Oh, just a bunch of stuff I've had too long. I could give you a deal on the whole lot, if you're interested. The time someone put into this. These photos, a Valentine. Tickets to a Ricky Nelson concert? Before your time, but oh my I had such a crush on that man. If he'd played his cards right... Oh, I had a dress just like that. 'Course, that was back when I had a figure like that. But who's ever going to buy someone else's memories? How much do you want for this? Oh, well, a valuable personal item like that? These don't come along every day. Look at the binding. All the work that went into it... I couldn't let that go for any less than, say... I'll give you ten dollars. Sold. These two, Sarah and Jonathan, they're so sure of each other. Look at the way he looks at her. There's this one in front of a roller coaster. Here, at a carnival or a state fair or something. But you can just feel the love in their relationship. You don't believe in this stuff, remember? True love and all? But these people look like the real deal. Oh, hey, didn't the waiter take you to dinner tonight? Although, he's not just a waiter. Would you believe he's also an actor? A waiter and an actor? What are the odds? It's late and I gotta turn in, but a word of advice? Please. Find someone. Like Sarah and...? Jonathan. Jonathan. Find someone wonderful, pick a date, rent a church, and be insanely happy instead of just... you know. What? Insane. Good night. Good night. I know the price was right, but you really think this place is going to work for a studio? Seriously, Chloe. What is their secret? I don't think there's really a secret. I think it'll work or it won't. Man, you seriously have a lot of equipment. Did you leave anything in New York? It's so obvious in every photo. They know something I don't. Well, I'm obviously talking to myself, so... Break time. You planning a trip to the mountains? This is what I want. Backpack, blisters? This. Entire book. Look how happy they are? That's pretty much how love looks. Especially when someone's pointing a camera at you. Even biking along a lake. Looks like the Stow Lake at Golden Gate Park. Whoever they were... Wait, they lived right here in San Francisco? My days are filled with mistakes, some that I didn't make, I carry them around. Some people don't feel a thing, some kind of blissful dream, I wish I could live that now. Oh I wish I could live that now. Oh yeah, those two are reaching out to tell you something. Definitely a sign. Definitely a sign! Ok, read it for me. Ok, well the sign says that contrary to everything you seem to believe, lasting love is possible. That scrapbook proves it. Bits and pieces. But maybe there's more to it. I wonder if I could find them. You know, get the whole story. What, play Nancy Drew and track them down? Yes, is that such a crazy idea? Only when you say it out loud. No last names, addresses... An old phone number. I wonder if it's still working. July 29th 1971. Where is this? Huh. Vito's. Do you really think the answer to your mystery is in those photos up there? This place has to be somewhere, there's no listings online, there's nothing with the phone company so I figured why not try your wall? Is this a thinly veiled excuse to flirt with me? Oh, it must be so crowded in your head with an ego that size. See, now we're talking, light banter back and forth. While I'm on a roll, what are you doing Saturday night? Dinner? Only if it's at Vito's. Hey. Right in front of you. What does that say? Right up there, doesn't that say Vito's? Vito's. That's about thirty years ago, looks like the Mission district, right? Around 24th. You know it? Yeah. I mean, if it's the place I'm thinking of. Changed owners a couple of years ago. Still an Italian name. Alfredo's... Adagio. Adoraddo's. Adoraddo's. I'll tell you what, I get off in ten minutes, I'll take you there, we can check it out together. Why would you wanna do that? Well, you know, you'll have a hard time finding it on your own. And, well, you've kind of peaked my interest. [sighs] So what do you say? You wanna go? Yes. But this is not a date. It's not a date. This is research. Whatever you need to tell yourself. If this is the same place and they have the old reservation records... From what, forty years ago? That's kind of a long shot. It's better than no shot at all. So if they have them, I might be able to find a last name or maybe even a phone number. Woah, you know it might not even be the same owners. Better slow down there. Yeah, you flew through that stop sign back there. I almost stopped. So how do you feel about stop signs? I see it. Do you see it? Do you? I see it, and here we go. What are you doing? I get the impression that you'd be more comfortable behind the wheel. Gabe, get back in the car. Sorry, don't keep the nice people waiting. [Horn honking] Are you out of your mind? I've actually never had an official diagnosis. [Horn honking] I cannot believe this. [Horn honking] You are crazy. You're crazy. I can't believe I got in the car with you. This is ridiculous. Still the best Italian in the city. When you use your father's recipes, Vito. If only he hadn't kept most of them in his head. Hi. Oh, hi, welcome, come on in. I'll be right with you. He had a gift, alright. See you soon. Take care, Jack. Yeah. Gabe, that's the booth. Hi. I'm Vito Marino Junior. Owner, manager, chef, head waiter and host. Wow, all that. Well, it's all I can afford. Didn't this place used to be called Vito's? Yes, when my dad owned it. And when he passed it down to me I figured new generation, new name. Might have been a mistake. Can I get you two a table? Perhaps this romantic corner? No, no, we're not- Don't argue with the nice man. You know, I'm never wrong. It's the body language. No, we're not here for lunch. Oh, well it's a restaurant, and it is lunch. You get my confusion? Yes. I'm here because I am trying to find- We're trying to locate these people in the photos here. Oh, like in a "Where's Waldo". No, not exactly. You mind if I take a look? Sure, please. It certainly is this place. It hasn't changed much, has it? Huh. July 29th, 1971. My dad was a master chef. Me, not so much. My wife did all the cooking, God rest her soul. I'm only telling you this because you're not eating. Pizza delivery is the only thing that's keeping me in business these days. But lucky for you guys, my dad was also a nut for keeping records. Never threw away a thing. Wow, all these? Every reservation, every stock order, every bill in one of these boxes. So I'm gonna leave you guys to it. I'm gonna go upstairs and see if someone comes in. It could happen. Well, this is more than I had hoped. You sure you're up for this? Yeah. I mean, it's not exactly how I pictured my afternoon going, but yeah. Let's do it. Chloe. 1971, May, June, July. July 29th. Birthday dinner, 8:00 pm, cake to read "Happy Birthday, Sarah". And that's all. There's not even a phone number. But we know her birthday, the month and the day. Hey, find what you needed? Well, no, not everything, but something. It was a birthday dinner. Ah, well, people used to come here and celebrate a lot of things. Now they come at all and I celebrate. I've been taking a look at your book. These two really got around. Take a look at this fish. Now that's a winner. Yeah, I mean, it could be a clue. The park, the ranger, everything. I saw that, but it could be any park in the country. That's odd. [Phone rings] Gabe? I'm closing up and I wanted to say thanks for today. Ok, seriously, why'd you call. I had a good time and I wanted to tell you that. That's it? That's it. So... good night. Ok, good night. Thank you for your help today. Any time. Well, it's too big for a post office box and too weird for a house key. Something sentimental maybe? Did you show this to Gabe? Why would I do that? It seems like you two make a good team. Holmes and Watson, Batman and Robin. Matlock and... whoever he had. I don't know, look. He found the restaurant, you couldn't, and let's face it, he's kinda hot. Can we change the subject please? Fine. You've got an old restaurant and a key that doesn't fit anything. What next? Taylor, I'm overlooking the one person who probably knows exactly who this book belongs to. It's so obvious! I need a clue. Seriously. Sounds like... how many syllables... what are we talking? What's with you and that book? I want to find the original owners and return it. Well, don't you think if they wanted it they might have kept it? Maybe they lost it. I mean, in any case it's a story I really want to hear. How did it end up in a discount bin at a flea market? A swap meet. It's a fine line. Can you help me or not? I suppose I could spend my free hours digging through months of receipts and come up with something, but it's a lot of work. I'll do it for a hundred bucks. A hundred? Take it or leave it. I do not need her help. I'm doing just fine on my own. What've you got so far? I know their first names, I have a birth date for her. Well I have the date that they went out for dinner so it has to be close. I know that they were local when the photos were taken. And? That is it. Pay the hundred. [Knock on the door] So this is where the magic happens. Not yet, but soon. Huh. So what's the concept here? Portraits, wedding photography, that sort of thing? Oh, that's not really your style, is it? It's my art studio, and I do real estate photography on the side. Sales brochures, architectural portfolios, that sort of thing. Yeah, that makes sense. This must be Gabe. Oh, you've been talking about me? Well, Reggie and I also had a long discussion about termites this morning. Cute. But you might change your attitude when you see what I found. I went to the library this morning. Old school, I like it. That fishing photo. My dad and I used to go camping every summer. Something about the badge on the ranger's shirt... it's not very clear, but is that a match? Why yes, Gabe, I think it is. Which tells us that he is a wildlife specialist at Yosemite National Park. Is that close? Did you do any research on this part of the country before you moved here? Ok, well what are the chances that this guy still actually works there? Way ahead of you. Yosemite National Park staff photo. Oh, that is absolutely the same guy. Look at the ears. Stan Benwick. Stan Benwick. So when do we go? What, we? Oh yeah, you can't go by yourself, it's too dangerous. To begin with, you don't know the way, and then there's mountain lions to contend with, rock slides, fresh air. You want to protect me from fresh air? Oh, yeah. If you're not used to it, it can go right to your head. Isn't that right, Reggie? It's a silent killer. Great! Pack a bag. We leave at dawn. No, no. You can't just go, we need to call ahead, I need to clear my schedule, we need to check the weather... Or we could just go. The book says he's there, the internet says he's there, we know the park's there. Let's roll the dice. What do you say? Are you in? What's all this? A tent, stove, provisions. And a canoe? We're just going up and back. Yeah, it's called be prepared. The motto, Boy Scouts. Anyway, it's a great motto, a motto to live by. Yeah. It's six am, so it's just too early for this conversation. So that means I win? You win. We'll have a great day! Great day. The cold, the sky, the dark. and time stands still everything is moving... So fast, you lose, your will but everybody knows the shape you're in, everybody runs away sometime. We all want to say that everything is all right. in the meantime. So all this gear, you just happen to have it on hand? Oh yeah, we loved camping. The whole family. Mom, dad and me. Oh, you're an only child. Hard to believe? Not to anyone with a passing knowledge of psychology. I'll take that as a compliment. Of course you would. Alright, what about you? You have any siblings? Uh, just my sister. She's pretty, smart, incredibly successful. You're not close. How did you know that? A passing knowledge of psychology. It's closed. Huh. I guess we should have called ahead. Well, then we'll come back tomorrow. What're we going to do for an entire day? I bet this canoe doesn't look so silly now, right? Ok, I need you to pick a side. I'm gonna stay on the right here. No. Gabe. Yes? Stop telling me what to do. I know how to canoe a canoe. Ok, just stay there on the left. Ok, I'm paddling like crazy and we're getting nowhere. That's because your stroke is all wrong and we're not in sync. Ok, excuse me. But this is not exactly something I do every day. Ok, look, you're tired, why don't you just put the paddle down and let me do the work. Not a chance! I'd never hear the end of it. You have a stubborn streak, you know that? It's kind of attractive. I have to say this. Has anyone ever told you that you can be extremely condescending? Yeah, all the time. Say cheese! Put that down. That is incredibly expensive equipment. Oh, interesting. When the camera is on the other foot... that didn't come out right, but you know what I mean. No, I don't. Switch places with me, because I've figured this out and you have the easy end. So you need to switch with me. No, it's a canoe, there is no easy end. You just do it. Woah, woah! It's fine! [Screams] I can't swim! Is this the part where I said I told you so, or do I wait for you to dry off? Shut up and help me! Good news, I saved the camera! I can't swim, I can't swim! Stand up. I hope you have an appetite. You made this with a can opener and a pan? Yeah, it's just salmon. And risotto and broccoli and pine nuts. Oh. Mmm. What is the sauce? The beurre blanc. Nothing to it. I couldn't make this if I had Martha Stewart on speed dial. Where'd you learn to cook like this? I always loved food. I was the only kid on the block who preferred risotto to mac and cheese. But I couldn't afford the four star restaurants when I went off to college so I taught myself. See, there's something else I didn't know about you. You went to college. Yes. It's kind of a prerequisite for law school. You have a law degree? Yes, I was an attorney. I hated it. So I saved up a few bucks and took a few years off to figure out what I really want to do with my life. And you chose bartending? As a temporary calling. Haven't you been doing it for- A couple years. Actually three years. Hey, save room for dessert. So did you always want to be a photographer? Uh, yeah. I got my first camera when I was seven and haven't looked back. So you're always comfortable putting a lens between you and life? Look, it's late and I'm tired. Can we just turn in? Yep. Do you need some help there? It's just a little hard to navigate in here. There's actually a zipper right here- I'm good, thanks. Do I make you uncomfortable? No, but don't try anything funny 'cause I know a lawyer. Yeah. What's that smell? The pine trees? [laughs] I have a room spray like that. Didn't know this is where they got it. You know, you being from New York and all. Yeah. [Owl Hooting] What's that? You've never heard an owl before? Hoo hoo! [Owl Hooting] [Laughs] Sounds like a cartoon. [howling] There's Wile E. Coyote. Thanks. [growl] What was that? I actually don't know. Was that a bear? No, no, no. Bears are afraid of humans, especially when there's a fire going. The fire is still going? It is if you put logs on it. That was your job because fire is a man thing. I think that you're thinking of caveman culture. Relax, just go to sleep, you'll be fine. Besides, this tent is bear-proof. It's been lab tested. I won't let anything happen to you. I promise. Good night. Good night. Goreng Pikus. How's that? Goreng Pikus. Rainbow Trout. One of the biggest ever taken out of the lake. July 1971. You remember. Twenty nine inches, eight and a half pounds. Wow, what a memory. Not me, can't remember what I had for breakfast. But this fish is right here. Right up there. I see it every day. You'd remember it, too. Who caught it? Is there a name? Well, there was a name plate on it, fell off back some time around Reagan. So you don't know who caught it? Sure I do. These folks right here, the photograph and all. Whoever they were. Tori, is that her name? Why do you say that? This picture right here says "Tori in her garden". That's just a friend or relative, I don't really know. Does it mean something to you? Yeah. There's this place right around the corner from where I grew up, my mom would go there every Sunday and get flowers. I haven't thought about it in years. Tori's Garden. The girl would be grown now, maybe about your age. Where did you get this? I found it at a swap meet. We're looking for the owner, a woman named Sarah. We want to return the book to her. And the memories. There's a beautiful love story here and I really think that she deserves to relive that. You don't have a last name? Just Sarah and Tori here. I don't suppose that this could be you. She's very sweet, but no, I have no idea who she is. It's just such a coincidence, I mean, Tori and her garden. Your place, Tori's Garden. I'm sorry, I can't help you. How about I leave my number if you think of anything. I'll be glad to call. Thanks. So this is where you grew up? Yeah, haven't been back in a long time. With mom and dad gone there really hasn't been any reason. Well, since we're so close, why don't you take me by the old place? It's only fair, you saw photos of where I grew up. Yeah. Aunt Sarah? Hi, it's Tori. I hope you're sitting down. Wow, hard to believe this is the same house. How long has it been? Eleven, twelve years. It's so much smaller than I remember. Oh, hello. I decided you weren't coming. Bill and Monica? Oh, no, I'm actually- Yes, we are. You must be Shirley? The realtor, yes. Sorry to keep you waiting, is it too late to see the house? Not at all, the seller's not home. Come on in. Coming, Bill? Right behind you, Monica. I have to say, you don't look a thing like your voices. I'm usually so good at that. [Phone vibrating] Sorry, I have to take this. Would you mind showing yourselves around? There's an information sheet on the table. Thanks. Hello? Yes, this is Shirley. Wow. This all used to be wallpaper. Chinese birds, I think. No wonder they took it down. We had a grandfather clock in that corner. Dad used to have an easy chair, listened to the radio on Sundays. This was our breakfast room. Mom used to make the best pancakes from scratch. Good memories. Yeah, good. Bad. All kinds. What is it? It's my parents' room. It's so weird. It's like I have this feeling that if I just turn the knob and open the door they'll be there. Dad dozing and mom reading. You can't go home again. You can, it's just different. [Shutter snaps] Hope you don't mind. No, we don't mind. You look really happy in these shots. I mean wet, but happy. We had fun, surprisingly. No, I mean like moment in your book happy. You think so? ave the same phone number. Can I ask, is this you? That was me, alright. And that's Jonathan and Sarah you say? Please tell us you remember them. Never saw them before or since. But I do recall that car and how much this fellow wanted it. He wanted to test drive it, so the four of us went for lunch down to the waterfront. Jerry and I weren't married at the time. This couple, they were so much in love. Being around them got us thinking. A month later we tied the knot. You wouldn't happen to have any old paperwork, like a cancelled cheque or something? That was a lifetime ago. A happy lifetime. Because of them. So many people passed through Sarah and Jonathan's lives and there's not one single lead. How is that possible? There must be something we've overlooked. What about this? The skating rink? Yeah, it's over on Bayview. I used to go there when I was a kid. Sort of a local landmark. Thousands of people must have skated there over the years, what could we possibly find there? Look what she's got. Skates? That's not so unusual at a skating rink. No, in her hand. [Gasps] It's the key! Sorry, this hasn't been a roller rink in a couple of decades. 37 doesn't mean anything to you? My son is 37, does that help? Not really, but thank you. Wait a minute, come to think about it they used to rent personal lockers back there. Could it maybe be a locker key? It's so damp. Yeah, we flooded it a few years back. Nobody uses this area. That's the thing about the past. Once it's gone, not many take the time to look back. Well, they're not in order. What a mess. You know, I can't imagine what you'd be looking for after all these years. A pair of old socks, maybe. Oh hey, Chloe. Number 37. An extra pair of... old socks. Wait. Wow, Nixon is president. Think he'll last? Woah, what's that? Dear Sarah, my darling Sarah. Beautiful Sarah. They're love letters. Why would she leave them in a locker? Maybe she lived at home and didn't want her parents to see them? The guy had a way with words, that's for sure. I thought I was happy before I met you, but in meeting you I realized how I had no idea what happiness meant. You're not only everything I want, you're everything I ever knew I wanted. I thought the photos were special. No one writes letters like this anymore. What's this? Your presence is requested. Chloe, look at this. It's a wedding invitation. Yeah, but I can't make it all out. There's water damage. Sarah Lunde and Jonathan something. Sarah Lunde. She has a last name. It's her maiden name, so that's not going to help. What about the groom? It's just Jonathan, it's water damaged, washed away. I can't see. [Phone rings] Chloe Davenport, hello? Hello? If you're selling something- I know who you are, and I want you to stop what you're doing. Oh my god, is this Sarah? Stop this search and leave me alone, please. Tell me, is this Sarah? Leave me alone. Please. I have read romance novels that weren't this steamy. You're sure it was her on the phone? Did you check caller I.D.? It was a private number, and she's definitely onto us. How could she have tracked you down. Somewhere along the line someone must have known more than they were letting on. Sarah wants us to give up the search, she was very clear about that. Did she sound angry? Suspicious? I don't know, she kind of caught me off guard. She was firm, I guess. You know what, maybe we should just let the whole thing go. Let it go? Have you never read a detective novel? This is where it gets good. I mean, why doesn't she want us to find her? Do you think maybe she murdered him? That's how it turns out on CSI. No one murdered anyone. Ok, Sarah is definitely hiding something, and we finally have our first real lead. So... The wedding invitation? Yeah, but I mean there's no groom's last name, which means there's no Sarah's married name. But there would have been an announcement in the newspapers. Oh, I'm way ahead of you. I have already Googled and Bing-ed her and there's no record anywhere. It's been erased. You know what though? I mean, we have the date of the wedding and the address of the church, why don't we go there? O-63. O-63. I hate to interrupt. Is this about a wedding? Ours? No. Why does everyone assume we're together? O-63. Uh, it's about a wedding, yes. But one that already happened. So it's about marital counseling then. We could use that. We're not together. We're not getting married. We're not married. It's about a wedding that happened 40 years ago. That was a little before my time. I-21. I-21. Keep your eyes on your card. You have that one, too. We're actually looking for a couple that was married here in 1971. I'm sorry, I can't help you. There was a fire in '93 and all the files were destroyed. Ugh. This is really starting to feel hopeless. Chloe. Nothing is ever hopeless. Have faith. G-52. Bingo. Bingo! I won! I won! Well, it looks like you're a $100 richer. That's exactly what Mabel wanted to go through her records. You think she'll do it for us? Um... last time you said you'd do it for $100. I have a right to be compensated for my time. It's not a crime, is it? Uh, no, but here's the hundred. The price has gone up. I couldn't even consider it for less than200 bucks. 200 now? Miss Potter, I shouldn't be showing you this, but you leave me no choice. What was that? Was that a gas card? You've already seen too much. A badge? Was it a badge? Who are you two with? The police? Bigger. The FBI? Oh. The IRS? We can't discuss it. The IRS? Oh, shhh. Please keep your voice down. Sorry. The IRS? You are clearly an intelligent woman, so you've no doubt surmised that this is an issue of some importance. Is there a photo of something in that book that there shouldn't be a photo of? Or someone? A big time tax evader? We cannot confirm or deny. We can only ask your country's help in locating the donor of that property. Not here. Big ears. Prying eyes. Come with me to my office. This is your office? Excuse me if I don't meet your federal standards, but this works for me. Ink and paper, that's what I put my trust in. How do you find anything? I have a system, it's called "it's in here somewhere". And I pay my taxes, every penny. 1993, '97... I'm closing in here. Hold this. I'm getting closer. I'll know it when I see it. Ah! You found it? Key lime pie recipe! I thought it was gone for good. Ok, ok, here we go. Name, address, phone. I think you'll find it's all here. Can I see- I feel pretty weird about this. Well, do what you think is right. I am bound by law, however, to inform you that you've been under constant surveillance. Surveillance? Oh, don't, don't look around. Just keep your eyes on me. There's a half dozen cameras trained on you right now. Here, take it. We thank you. Your government thanks you. Take it and forget you ever saw me. Is this the info we've been looking for? Sarah Lunde... That can't be right. Why not? Lunde is her maiden name. Well, that's what it says right there. Sarah Lunde. Maybe we couldn't find a wedding announcement because... There was no wedding? Gabe. Where are you? You'll never guess what I'm doing. At this point, nothing would surprise me. I'm in the car tailing Sarah Lunde. I thought you were gonna wait for me to be done work. No, no, I know that was the plan but we're so close I couldn't wait. So you're in a car chase. Is this the same woman that quoted me the speed limit? It's not a car chase, she was driving away when I got to her house so I followed her at a sensible speed keeping a low profile. The target has pulled into a flower nursery. Wow, in a few short weeks you've turned into Sam Spade. What do I do? Introduce yourself. Talk to her. I'm nervous. I think I'm having second thoughts. Chloe, if you get a chance just talk to her. Ok, I gotta go. She entered the store. Do you need back up? Stay by the phone. Stop following me. I'm not, I'm shopping. A plastic owl? Yeah, I had a real one but he died. I saw you outside. And here in the shop. Ok, I'm following you. You're that woman, aren't you? Chloe Davenport, nice to meet you. There is nothing nice about this at all. I know it was you on the phone, but if you only knew why I was trying to find you, I have- If it's about that book- Yes! Yes, so you know! If you had any idea what we've been through to try to find you, we found your fish on the wall, the park ranger, he sent us to the flower shop. That was your Tori, wasn't it? It was. Then we went to the skating rink and we found your old locker with the box of old letters... Why are you doing all of this? That is what I would really like the chance to explain to you. I... I don't want to hear it. Then why did you ask? It was rhetorical. Please, I just really need to know about the wedding. We couldn't find a wedding announcement- Because it never happened. There was no wedding. And I have no intention of reliving all that in the middle of a garden center. Or anywhere else, for that matter. What do you mean, there was no wedding? So what exactly do you think Or anywhere else, you're going to find there? If there is even a trace of ink left on this paper, I'm going to find it. And if I can get Jonathan's last name, we can find him. And if I find him- Chloe, we were right. I mean, there was no wedding. She told you so herself. Well, I don't care what she said. Those people in those photos are the only truly happy, loving couple I've ever known. I put my faith in them. And if this perfect couple couldn't make it, what chance do I have? A little melodramatic, don't you think? I need to know what happened, and if Sarah won't tell me then it's up to Jonathan. Wait, wait! Is this a D? O, D, D? Yeah, Jonathan Dodd. One, two, three. [Knocks on door] [Knocks on door] Can I help you? Mr. Dodd? Who's asking? You don't know me. No, I don't. I've been looking for you for a very long time. Are you bill collectors? No, no. We're old friends, Mr. Dodd. Not really good friends I guess, since I'm not the guy you're looking for. We're neighbours. Oh. Do you know where we might find him? He's gone for lunch probably, same place he always goes. Do you know where that is? I can't tell you exactly, but he's nuts about some place called Vito's. Vito's? Got some sentimental attachment. Jack's odd that way. Jack? Odd about a lot of things. Not Jonathan? Everybody calls him Jack. What kind of friends are you? Thank you. Hey, that first day at the restaurant. Yeah, the guy that was just leaving. Wasn't his name Jack? This Jack? This is the guy you've been looking for all this time? He can't really be the same person. We'll, there's only one way to find out. Gabe, you can't just go out and ask him. Sure I can. Ok, well be careful how you do it because if he reacts the same way Sarah did- You're forgetting there's a difference. I know what I'm doing. Hey there, Jack is it? Yeah, who are you? Name's Gabe. Sorry to interrupt. I've been thinking about investing some money in here and Vito told me you're kind of a regular. Ever since his father ran the place. So you're in the restaurant game, huh? I'm thinking about it. Well, you couldn't find a better place than Vito's. Sorry, Adoraddo. Never did get used to the name. Way to fancy for me. Wow. What's in a name? Yours for instance, it's not really Jack, is it? Jonathan, Jon, Jack. Call me anything, just don't call me late for dinner, right? Sit down if you like. So what's so special about this place? Well, more than the food. For me, it's the memories. Back when it opened I proposed to my girl here at this very table. Your wife? Well, it didn't work out that way. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, well, it's a long story. Well, as it happens, I have some time. Hey Vito! A bottle of wine over here. It's on me. Great. Her name was Sarah. Prettiest woman I ever saw. Stubborn maybe, everything by the book. But where it counted... I was so crazy about her. So what happened? Well, she had been hurt in the past, afraid it wouldn't be perfect. Perfect is asking a lot, especially with a guy like me. She needed guarantees nobody could give her. Life's a crap shoot, same with love. You close your eyes, you take a leap and trust the feelings to last. But I would have bought her the moon if she had asked. When it came right down to it... So the wedding... She opted for safe. So Jack has been coming in here for years. I've never heard that story once. Not a clue. How did you do it? Trade secret. Bartender. You're a bartender? Bartender, attorney, chef. You're a chef, too? He's terrific, actually. Ok. You are going to try a slice of this pizza and tell me what you think. One for you. Alright. And one for you. It's hot, be careful. Mmm. This is really good. Be honest. Yeah, this is your recipe? It's my dad's recipe. It's great. I feel so badly for him. Yeah. Look what it cost them both. Hey, your show is still up. Until this weekend. Let's go in. It hasn't changed. Humor me. You know, maybe I spoke too soon last time. I look at your pictures now and I don't just see an old house, chipped paint, empty swings. I see you. They're really beautiful, Chloe. The light and the composition. You know, looking at these now after the past few weeks with you, it seems like the work of someone else. It does lack the full spectrum of human emotion. Yeah? Yes. Just think of all the people we've met over the past few weeks, the couples, the faces. It's been quite a journey. Chloe, I don't want to live my life like Jack. Wishing things had worked out differently. He knew what he wanted and he lost it. It's not the story I had hoped to hear. I thought that they could change my mind about relationships and if they couldn't make it work- No, Chloe, you can't live other people's lives for them, you have to find what you want, what you love, and live for that. Chloe, I think I'm falling in love with you. I'm sorry, did you hear what I said? Yes, yes I did. And that's so flattering and I like you Gabe, I really do, but it's never going to work out between us. It's just not. Because you won't let it. Because I can't. Because it would end. It always does. Love never works out. And the only thing worse would be having it not work out with you. Wow. I guess I should have seen that coming. Gabe. No, I... I get it, Chloe. I do. Um, can I walk you home? No, I think I'm going to stay here for a little bit actually. Ok. [Knocks on door] Not you again. I just need a minute. I am perfectly capable of calling the police. Just please look. I told you I don't want to see it. Now why won't you listen to me? Because I need to understand. This whole thing, it started out as a mystery, something to do... Well, have you considered crosswords? It's become so much more than that. I really need to talk to you. Please, Sarah. I cleaned the attic a year ago and found this. I didn't have the heart to burn it or throw it away. I guess I thought maybe somebody could use the pages or something. And now, like it or not, here it is again. Maybe some things are just meant to be. The roller rink. You were there, you say? They still play that terrible organ music? I don't know. Our trip to the mountains. Our boat overturned. I almost drowned. You can't imagine. Actually, I can. None of those shots are in here, of course. Only smiles. Happy memories. Decades in the attic gathering dust, where I thought it should remain. So you really don't want it back? I really don't. Memories are too hard to look at. See, I don't get that. When you look at these photos- The photos don't show how it turned out. Jonathan's car. He drove us around all day hoping someone would notice. And that's the sweet couple that sold it to him. You know they're still together? They say you two were the reason. Well, I'm glad something good came of it. Whatever possessed you to buy this? I thought it was inspiring. A real life storybook romance. There's no way you could have known, I suppose. How do you take your tea? Milk. It was all my fault. Something I have to live with. We got to the big day and I just couldn't go through with it. What stopped you? What caused that doubt? I didn't believe in love, I guess. I wanted to spare myself some imagined heartache. So I panicked. I ran. And I thought if he came after me, that would prove something. But he didn't. He was the one who was hurt. And I have missed that man every day of my life. Did you ever tell him? After standing him up like that? No. I chose to leave mad enough alone. And you never found anyone else. Not another his equal. So I made my life about my friends, about my work. And it hasn't been unpleasant. But it might have been wonderful. What have I done, Taylor? If I heard right, Gabe pretty much said he loves you and you pretty much dismissed it. It's because everything about the man is wrong. He's cocky, he's impulsive. He got... he got a law degree to be a bartender. He is impossible. Then you did the right thing. Yeah, I guess. So the whole adventure was for nothing? Not if Gabe and I can get Sarah and Jonathan back together. Well, there's a challenge. You think he's up for it? I think Gabe will want to see this thing through. And I have an idea. So you want me to offer a free meal to some woman I don't even know? Yes, but think of it as a promotion, or just helping out your best customer. What are you up to? I'm begging you. Look, Gabe and I we're trying to fix something that's really overdue for fixing. I'll dial, all you have to do is talk. I hope this is legal. What do I say? Hello? Sarah Lund? This is Vito Marino of the world famous Adoraddo restaurant downtown. Nice touch. I've got good news for you. Your name has been chosen at random to receive one complimentary meal. Yes. What night? Friday. Friday night. Time? Seven. How about 7:00 pm? We look forward to seeing you. Wow. That felt good. This is going to be great. Roller coasters, boy how I hated those things. I'd ride with her all day if she asked. I knew how much she loved them. Jack, when was the last time you wore a tie? I'm not a tie kinda guy, check the book. A beauty, wasn't she? She still is. Are you sure you're alright with this? Is she ok with this? That's the real question. Hey, she sounded great on the phone. Sure she did. Sarah was always great. Where'd you say you found this? At a swap meet. It's a shame, isn't it? Anybody's memories should wind up for sale. [bell] Hey, Vito, we have a customer. She's here. Showtime. Some advice from an old guy. If you find love, hold onto it. Trust your heart. It never lies. Excuse me, miss. Is this seat taken? Jonathan? You haven't changed a day. Oh, well... your eyesight must be failing. Maybe. But my memory is working up here. It's like yesterday. Wherever my father is tonight, I know he's smiling. It's like they've never been apart. Yeah. Makes the whole search worth it. What are you doing? Well, it's a special meal. You didn't think I was gonna trust it with Vito, did you? Ok, still, you should probably ask. He knows. You know that nest egg I've been sitting on? That career I've been looking for? What, you're going to buy the restaurant? We worked it out this morning; Vito and me, 50/50 The kitchen, that's my 50. Hand me those tomatoes over there. Ok. In a way, this is all your idea, so it better work out. Yeah. Speaking of ideas, do you think we could talk about the other night at the gallery? It was all my fault. Huge mistake. I was jumping in without thinking things through as usual. We just found Jack, anything seemed possible. Truth is, some things, they just aren't possible. They just aren't. Sure. Yeah, you were clear from the start, never lead me on. Whatever I thought was going on, it was all in my head. Let's just leave it at that. No harm, no foul. Here's to us. Over the past few weeks, I've developed a new appreciation for faces, for relationships. Old ones, new ones, and relationship rediscovery. It's an exciting new direction for me. Very nice, Miss Davenport. Your work is stunning. It demonstrates a deep understanding of matters of the heart. I'm impressed. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr... Crestor. Art critic for the Chronicle. Give me a call this coming week. I'd like to do a profile on you. If you don't mind. No, I don't mind. Thank you very much. Was that somebody? That was Jeffrey Crestor, wasn't it? The critic? He specializes in neo-expressionism. I read. Sweetie, would you mind getting us something to drink? Anything wet. Sure. So... what did he say? He loves my work. And you know who else does? My fianc. Your what? I know, I wouldn't believe it either, except I have proof. I am absolutely... Me too. Absolutely. And he wants to buy a framed copy of that one. The couple in the restaurant. He finds it inspiring. I've gotta go. Hey, we'll be closing up soon. Do you want me to start packing stuff up? Just one more minute? Sure. My days are filled with mistakes some added in make. I carry them around. Some people don't feel a thing Some kind of blissful dream I wish I could live that now. Oh, I Wish I could live that now. Chloe? What are you doing here? It is your first day with the new business and I thought that deserved a celebration. Yeah, um... how did you get in? Oh, just a suggestion that the first thing you might need is a new alarm system. Yeah. Hey, um... listen. About the other night... There's plenty of time to talk about that over breakfast. Breakfast? What is this? It's only breakfast. And I microwaved half of it, so don't worry, your job is safe. Sit. Um... there's something I want to say, and I want to get all the way through so please don't interrupt. You and I could not be more wrong for each other, and you have no concept of the rules of the road, you choose your adventure at the drop of a hat. You nearly drowned me and fed me to wildlife. Is that it? That is the tip of the iceberg. But the thing is, Gabe, I love that iceberg. I really do. And if it melted, I don't know what I would do. So just so you don't forget that... What's this? A peace offering. Sarah had a great idea. This is just a start. There's plenty more pages to be filled in if you're game. And do you Gabe, take Chloe to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer or for poor, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish from this day forward for as long as you both shall live? I do. I now proudly present you as husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. [Applause]
