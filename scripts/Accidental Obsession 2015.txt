Ms. Williams, this is an astounding verdict of Not Guilty on all counts surprising many in the legal community as well as the press, and public. My client is innocent and found to be by a jury of his peers. Now contrary to public opinion, a defendant should not be tried by the media. The evidence against your client was overwhelming from the forensic experts to the eye witnesses. Many are shocked by the outcome of this case and chalk it up to your client spending a fortune on a legal team that was able to manipulate the system and win on technicalities. How do you respond to that? Twelve neutral members of this community weighed the evidence and decided in favour of my client. Justice has been served. That's all for now. That was defense attorney Heather Williams winning the biggest case of her career. A huge victory for defense attorney Heather Williams. Not many in the legal community were predicting this outcome. Oh come on! We won! You should be ecstatic. You are a celebrity now. Oh Lisa, a celebrity? No. What? Nancy Grace wants you on her show. I'm not interested in Nancy Grace. Heather! There you are! Congratulations kiddo, you did it. Thank you. Now your brilliant work will make Ruben & Associates one of the most sought-after law firms in the state. And you, rightly so, deserve to be a part of it. That is, if you accept. Saul if you're asking me to be a partner I absolutely accept. Oh thank you Saul. Oh my God. Wow. Hmm? I will take that. You go. Stop. Congratulations counsellor. You did it. Well, thank you. We did it. I just can't believe it's over. 18 months on this case. Thousands of cups of coffee. Airports all over the world. You know what the best part of this job was? What? Getting to know you. Thank you. After the dust settles, would you have dinner with me? I would love to. Good. Good. Unfortunately I have to get going. Previous commitment. Oh that's a shame. Party's just getting started! I know. Love to stay but I have a client leaving the country in the morning so... Oh. Sounds like there's a possibility of some international intrigue in the works. Could be but you'll never know. Client confidentiality and all. Call you later. Ladies. Alright. Good night. Bye Jack. Oh stop that. Why not? He's handsome and smart and I saw the way you two looked at each other. You know what? Let's celebrate the victory. Okay well if you want me to start dropping any hints just let me know. Lisa. Yes? Can I have a moment with Heather please? Sure. Thank you so much. Look Heather I've got to go but before I do, I just wanted to let you know that I'm letting you to take the lead on the Eli Boden case. Really? Are you sure? Why not? You did fantastic on this case. I mean, you deserve it. Oh thank you. Now Boden's got deep pockets. And if we get this guy as a client it could put us on the map. Alright. I'll file a writ. Judge Andrews will never go for it but it will give us some time to build a defense. You're going to go far. Aww, thank you Saul. Have a good night. Everybody having a good time? Congrats all, everybody. Well done. Heather. What the hell are you doing here? You look as lovely as ever. What's it been, almost two years? Yes. I see you all over the television. Thought I'd come down here and congratulate you in person. Oh cut the crap. What are you doing here? Is there somewhere more private we can go? No. I want you back. What? Listen I know I screwed up our relationship and I take full responsibility for that. But I've changed! Are you joking? Getting involved with you was the biggest mistake of my life. What on earth? We were good together Heather. You have to give me another chance. No we weren't and no I don't. I don't even trust you. I think it's time for you to walk away. You know what? I'm going to walk away. It's not going to be that easy Heather. Don't you remember the good times? Yes. We had so many special moments together and we can have so many more. I remember those special moments and that's why I'm going to say goodnight. Don't contact me again. Are you okay? Yeah yeah. I saw Ray. I know. He's leaving. Are you sure? Hey. I'm a new partner. Let's go celebrate. Okay. Hello girls. I had a good night. Did you? Morning! Hey. Hi there. There's two nice surprises for you on your desk. Ooh two airlines tickets to a tropical island resort? Not quite that exotic but I think you'll like them. Bring me the Eli Boden file would you please? Nice ring. Thank you! Oh, wow. I have Jack Reilly on hold. Shall I tell him you're unavailable? Ha-ha, very funny. Put him through please. Hi Jack. Good morning. I just happened to be in your neighbourhood. Are you available for lunch? I have a client lunch but I would love to go take a walk with you afterwards and get some fresh air. Are you up for that? Absolutely. Okay I'll see you at 2:00, good? Queens Park? I'll see you there. Great. See you then. Hello. Nice to see you away from your desk and outside the courtroom counsellor. It is. Thank you. You're welcome. You know I have a little confession to make. Oh yeah what's that? I did a little research on you. Oh really? Mhm. What did you dig up? I know that you served in Afghanistan and Iraq. And then you joined the agency. Very good. And then you resigned to go into private investigating. You really have been checking up on me. Mhm. I could have worked anywhere, FBI, Secret Service. I decided I wanted to work for myself, then I could choose what cases to work on and when. Mhm? Being a private investigator fit the bill. And since we're on the subject of confessions I have to admit I've been doing a little checking up on you myself. Oh really? Oh. Single the past two years. No kids. And your favourite food is Japanese. Oh, no. No what? It's now Indian. That's a huge error there. Yeah it is. Well then I guess I better get to work on finding the best Indian restaurant in town for when I take you out to dinner. Well thank you. You know your CIA sources can help you with that I think. Oh trust me, they're on it. Oh good. I'm happy we were able to do this. So am I. Hey Jack. Nice kiss for a first date. Talk to you later. Damnit. Oh Damnit. Oh my God, ughh. Are you alright? Uh yeah I'm fine. How come you slammed on your brakes so fast? I'm sorry, a dog just ran right out in front of my car. I couldn't hit an animal. I'm sorry, it doesn't matter. It's my fault anyway I hit you right? So let's just exchange information. Right. Oh god. I don't have my driver's license. I must have left it. I do know my number by heart. You know it really doesn't look that bad. It's probably not worth your deductible and the increased insurance fees. If you want you could just pay for the repair directly and leave the insurance company out of it. Uh I'm not so sure about that. Well honestly I am feeling just fine and you don't have to worry, I won't show up tomorrow with a neck brace and crutches. Yeah that would be hilarious considering I'm a lawyer. Oh, why don't you just pay for the repairs. I'm okay, you're okay, everything's fine. And besides you seem like the kind of person who might do the same if the tables were turned. Did you not catch the part about me being a lawyer? That's funny. Here's my card. You call me when the estimate is ready. I'm Heather. Vanessa. And I'm glad you're not hurt. Have a good day. You too. Ray, give it up. There's a woman on the phone. Said she's a friend of yours? Vanessa? Oh that's right. Vanessa! Put her through. Oh hi, Heather. Can you meet me today? I should be able to show you a copy of the estimate. I could meet you downtown at lunchtime. Should I be sitting down? The body shop said it shouldn't be that bad. So how's 2:00? I'll bring you your cheque? Terrific. Francesco's Caf. 2:00 Great. I'll see you then. Alright. Bye. Bye. So it's actually a little worse than I thought. It's $1100. $1100 is much less than I expected actually. Don't worry about it. I'm paying for it, it's my fault. Remember? That's a relief actually because I'm between jobs right now and I don't think I could afford the repairs and I'd have to go through all the hassle of dealing with the insurance company and... I totally understand but I did forget your cheque at the office so we'll have to get it afterwards if you don't mind. Oh it's no problem. So how many days before you get your car back? They said just 4-5 days. Well if you need help with transportation let me know? That's very nice of you. Thank you for offering. What do you do for work? I'm a travel writer actually. That's my passion anyway. But I'm having a lot of trouble finding work here. It's hard to write about far off exotic places when you're stuck in East Crescentview trying to make ends meet right? If you hear of anything, strictly legal of course, let me know. I will. You have great hair by the way. Thank you! Thank you. I have to confess, I actually smoothed it out after I saw yours, I thought it was so pretty. Well thank you! I'm very flattered. So tell me what led you to become a lawyer anyway? Oh it's a long story. Well you know what, I'm starving. So why don't I order some food too and you can tell me while we eat? Sure. Here. That is a great story. Heather you have the most interesting life. I mean maybe professionally but not personally. Ah, you're single. Yes. Very. Divorced actually. I caught my ex having an affair with my best friend I decided to leave the state, get as far away from the two of them as possible, start fresh and voila! Here I am. Well, I'm sure it'll work out for the best. Everything happens for a reason, or so they say, right? If it weren't for the crash, I wouldn't have made my new friend. A toast, to friends. Well I guess we could toast tea. Heather. May I? You're kidding me? Hi there. I'm Ray Johnson. Vanessa. Heather and I, we used to be together. Okay. Well, uh... You haven't gotten back to me Heather. Yes. Have you given any more thought to our last conversation? Ray, this is really not the time nor the place. You didn't even thank me for the flowers I sent. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to ignore me. Hey, jerk. She doesn't want you here. Can't you see that? Maybe you should just leave. I can handle it. Spoken like a true lawyer. Can you actually just give us a moment? I'm sorry. Sure. Ray. Listen to me. I saw you outside my house last night. You cannot do that again. Why not? Or I'll call the police. You owe me another chance. I deserve another chance Heather. No I do not owe you anything. Hey are you okay? Is that bastard following you? We should do something about that. We? This is my problem. I can handle it but thank you. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you by saying that. No no, you didn't upset me. I'm just a little frustrated. I'm sorry. I just... I'm looking out for my new friend. No, it's fine. I can handle it but thank you. Can I catch a cab near here? You're not going to catch a cab. I'm going to drive you. We're going to pick up the cheque and I'll take you home. Are you sure? I'm sure it's out of your way and it's not the best part of town. It's totally fine. Hey! There you are. Hi. Thank you very much. And voila. Thank you. So this is my assistant Lisa. This is Vanessa. Hi Vanessa, nice to meet you. Lisa runs the show. And Vanessa is the one I got in the car accident with, obviously. So that's it. Great. Oh hey Jack. Hey. Hi. What are you doing here? Just dropping off the rest of the files for Miss Lisa. Thank you. Nice to meet you. You as well. Any chance you have time for a quick cup of coffee? I can't. Actually I have to drop Vanessa off. This is Vanessa, this is Jack. Nice to meet you Vanessa. Likewise. So maybe another time then? Bye. Can I ask you a question? Of course. Who is Jack? Jack is a private investigator. Oh well I know we're just getting to know each other but I got the impression there was chemistry between you two. Yeah well we'll see what happens. Well a catch like that you gotta move fast. Well we work together so I'm not sure how I'm going to keep that from getting complicated. Oh that's me, right up ahead. Oh it's not that bad. Well it's not exactly 5 stars but the price is right. Cute. Thank you so much for the ride. Sure. Talk to you later. See ya. Would you do me a favour? I'd like to see if we could find some work for my friend Vanessa. Vanessa? The woman that you got into the accident with. Right. She's new in town. I want to do something nice for her. Do you want me to do the background check or go through HR? No you can do it but I don't want her to know that I'm doing something nice for her and I have her driver's license number. Great. Give me a couple days. Thank you. Hello. Hi Heather. It's Vanessa. I'm going to be in town later today. Do you want to meet up for coffee? Actually I don't, I have to go on my daily run. You want a running partner? I could use a workout myself. Sure! I'll be at Queens Park in an hour. Great, I'll see you there. Okay. Talk to you later. You run every day? Yep. Try to. It's really good for stress. You know I always imagine that I'm running with whoever or whatever I'm up against at the time and I take off and I push past them. It's a great visualization. You must be really stressed right now. Why? Because we've been running for miles. Let me guess. It's your ex, Ray, right? Yeah, good guess. I'm going to visualize him right now. Oh okay. Haha. Oh hey it's the office. Can you give me a second? Yeah. Yeah sure. Take these, I'll meet up with you. Hey Saul. Yes I am working on that... Sorry about that. That's okay. Not again. Oh, it's Jack. Hey. Yeah tonight's good. Concerto's bar is good. 9:00 is good. Okay, see you then. Wow, Jack, nice. We have a date. Great. Well I've got one more case in town and then in three weeks I'm off to Europe. Business or pleasure? A little bit of both hopefully. I'm so sorry I'm late, the cab took a while finding this place. What are you doing here? Oh my god. I'm sorry. When you said we have a date, I assumed you meant me as well. I'm sorry, I should leave. No. Sit down. Yeah of course. No, please. Are you sure? Please join us. Yeah. Okay. There you go. Thank you. Can I get you something to drink? I'd love a glass of wine. Heather tells me you're a private investigator? Guilty as charged. That must be very exciting. Well I guess that all depends. On? Well who the client is for one. Well on that note, why don't we order something to eat? I'm starved. Thank you. Can I give you ladies a lift? Actually we're taking a cab. Thanks, good night. Vanessa, it was nice seeing you again. Oh, okay. Well, good night ladies. Good night. Thanks. Oh that was fun; we should do that again sometime. Haha. It was obvious Jack is crazy in love with you. Is it? Are you kidding? Girls would kill to have a guy like Jack. He's a sweetheart. Thanks. Oh my God. Good morning. Morning. Saul was looking for you. He wants to know how the Boden file is going. I told him you're up to your eyeballs in work on it. Yeah I've been a little distracted the past few days. He wants to see you in his office as soon as possible. Great. Do me a favour? Get this key cut. Sure. Oh and you have another message. Jack called and he wants you to give him a call back. Okay. Is there something you're not telling me? No comment. Hi! Hello? Hi, my birdies. You wanted to see me? Yes please, sit down. Eli called. Mm-hm. He's concerned that we're not giving our full attention to his case. He hasn't heard from anyone. I just started the defense. Is he looking for someone to hold his hand? Heather. If he wants someone from this law firm to tuck him in at night, we will. There are millions at stake here. Now you just make sure that you deal with it and keep him happy. Alright. Now don't get distracted, do you understand? Yes. Hello. Hi. Heather, it's Vanessa. I'm at the motel and I'm just thinking things through and I could really use your advice. About? Well I seem to have hit a brick wall and I don't know if I should move back home or stay here. Do you think we could meet and talk tonight? It would really help me. You know I'm sorry; I'm working on this big case. I really can't. I understand. And I don't really usually reach out about these things but I really respect your opinion and I could really use a talk. Uh, I don't think I can. Well you need to eat right? I could pick up takeout and bring it over and we could chat through dinner and then you could get right back to work. Okay I'll help you for an hour and then I'll have to work after that. Okay, great. Thank you for being such a great friend. Sure. Okay, bye. Blue is my favourite colour. Surprise! Dinner as promised. You scared me. Oh I'm sorry. The door was unlocked so I let myself in. So good to see you too. You too. You have birds! They're beautiful. Aww thank you. I love birds. They're so sweet. Sorry one second. You gotta be kidding me. Everything okay? Uh huh. Sonofa... Thank you for bringing it but now I feel like I filled my skirt, I'm so fill. That was delicious. Yeah. Thank you for your advice and for putting up with me. Well now I've got work... I am tired of being ignored. Ray! Get out! You think this is some kind of joke? I am going to call the police. Don't you walk away from me. Hey! Ow! That is not a very good idea. You and I are going to have a talk once this crazy bitch isn't around. No we're not. ...and that's never going to change. Get out of here! Go! And don't come back! Go! He's crazy. What were you thinking coming at him like that? I don't know, it was just reflex I guess. I had all these images of my husband threatening and beating me. I'm so sorry. Should we call the police? I could stay with you tonight. I could keep you company. No. No no, I'm fine. I have a lot of work to do and... Are you sure? Yeah thank you. Are you sure? Yeah yeah. Thanks for the food. Okay. Good night honey. Alright, thanks. Hello. Ray. It's Vanessa. Heather's friend. Really? Well we had way too much wine after you left and that's when she told me. Told you what? That she still loves you. She went on and on about how she really feels about you. That's when I felt truly awful for trying to stab you. Yes, that was a little crazy. I was going to call the cops on you. What else did she say? I'd really rather not talk about it over the phone. Could you meet me somewhere? I'm showing a house near Bryant Park. After I'm done we could meet there? That sounds great. Text me the address and I'll see you there. Something came up I wanted to show you. I sent you the file. So when I sent you the driver's license number that you gave me, this is what came up. That's not Vanessa. Exactly. I checked twice. And Vanessa's what, 5'4"? Yeah. This Vanessa is 5'8" I don't know what to make of this. Do you? No, but you could ask Jack to look into it. There's got to be some explanation. Sure, but it wouldn't hurt to look into it. Okay call and give him the details and see if he can meet with me tomorrow. Got it. Hi Ray. Nice suit. Makes a good first impression. Are you here just to blow smoke or what? Are you going to invite me in? Wow. This is a nice house. I should make an offer. Are you going to tell me what Heather said to you? Heather is crazy in love with you. She went on and on about how she misses being in your arms and making love to you. I knew it. The reason she broke up with you is because of pressure from her friends. Those bastards. That's right. And I started thinking if he's such a great guy, why treat him so badly? My thinking exactly. And then I thought I should get to know him better. Much better. Just think about it Ray. Heather dumped you once before, what's to stop her from doing it again? She's crazy if she can't see what a catch you are. You are my kind of man. You are strong, demanding, successful. Powerful. Why are you telling me this? I told you. I like you. What is this? A trick? You're Heather's friend. If she found out you're hitting on me. I guess that's a risk I'm willing to take. I think you're worth it. Say I was interested, how do I know you're not going to run off and tell her? I've got just as much to lose as you do Ray. That's my promise of secrecy to you. I won't tell if you won't. Some friend you are. This has nothing to do with friendship. I would never hurt Heather. But I'm a woman who knows what she wants and when I see it, I go after it. I want you. Now. You want me now. Are the owners come back any time soon? They are away for a few days. It's just the two of us. Why don't you make yourself comfortable and I'll pour us some wine? Sounds good. A toast. To what? To us. To us. Are you okay? I don't feel so well. Oh no. No, you don't, Ray. What did you do to me? Oh just a little poison. Why? Because you're such a nuisance honey. You're always popping up when it's least convenient. I need Heather to focus. No distractions. You're interfering with my plans, Ray. Did you honestly think that Heather was interested in you? Did you know she has a new boyfriend she really likes? His name is Jack. Heather doesn't know it yet but Jack loves me. Oh. Shh. Hey Heather, it's Jack. I can meet you tomorrow at Francesco's but listen, I've got some suspicions about Vanessa. See what you can find out about her and I'll see you tomorrow, alright? Okay, see you then. What was that? Hello? Hey Heather, it's Jack. I can meet you tomorrow at Francesco's but listen, I've got some suspicions about Vanessa. See what you can find out about her and I'll see you tomorrow, alright? Okay, see you then. Hi. What are you doing here? I wanted to surprise you. I'm surprised. Why didn't you just call? Oh I'm sorry. Where I come from it's just the way we do things. You know I'd invite you in it's just I have so much work that I brought home and... I'm sorry. I should go. Where do you come from? Is it Indiana? Idaho. Just outside of Boise. Oh that's right. What about your family? No family. They passed away when I was in my teens. Oh I'm sorry. You're asking a lot of questions. Yeah just trying to get to know you better. I thought you crossed me off your friends list. Oh, no. Not at all. Talk soon then. Sure. Give me a call. So Lisa filled me in on the DMV information not matching with Vanessa. I'll look into it to make sure it's not a mistake. You know she could be involved in some kind of identity theft or other fraudulent activity. You know before today I would have said no but now, I'm not so sure. Why's that? Since we met at the accident she's been... I don't want to use the word stalking, but nudging her way into my life. Dressing like me, doing her hair like mine, calling me continually. It's weird. You never told me any of this. Because I didn't think it was a big deal at the time. But I got your message and so I started asking her questions. Where are you from, your family, what do you do for work. She started getting suspicious so I stopped. Okay. Why don't you tell me exactly what she told you. Okay. I asked her where she came from, she said just outside of Boise. I asked about her family, she said she didn't have any they passed away when she was in her teens. And then she wondered why I was asking so many questions so that's about as far as I got. Okay. This is some good info to start. Just need a few days and by then I should have something more concrete. And when she calls? Just keep it friendly, don't change anything. If she's not who she claims to be and she suspects you're on to her, she might try to skip town and we don't want that. Yeah. You're so sweet. But now I have to go back to work. Come on, I'll walk you. Hi. Finally. I've been trying to reach you all day. Sorry I've been really busy with this big case. I left messages at your office. Why didn't you call me back? Like I said, I've been really busy with this big case. It feels like you're trying to avoid me. Well I'm not. I thought we'd have lots of time to hang out together with Ray out of the way. What do you mean with Ray out of the way? I mean, you haven't mentioned him bothering you anymore so I assumed he got the message loud and clear. Anyway with Ray gone I thought we'd have time to relax and I wouldn't have to protect you anymore and we'd have a lot of time to connect... Vanessa I'm so sorry to cut you off but I've got to get back to work. Okay so I'll just talk to you tomorrow. Twelve neutral members of this community weighed the evidence and decided in favour of my client. Justice has been served. That is all. That was defense attorney Heather Williams... Heather Williams... Heather Williams... Justice has been served. Thank you. Heather Williams. Hi. So you were right to be suspicious. It's confirmed. She is not Vanessa Miller. So I think I've come up with an idea that will let me dig a little deeper. Tell Vanessa that I'm looking for an assistant and I need to interview her first. Set up a meeting for tomorrow and pick a public place. Why can't I just tell her that I know she's lying so I can just get her out of my hair? Well you could do that but I think we should play this one out. Why? Well she is stealing identifies and we need to stop her. Right. Okay. One more thing. Why don't we meet at my place tomorrow evening? I want to make you dinner. I may even try an Indian dish. Wow. Then I can fill you in on what happens with Vanessa then. I'll be free after 6:00. Good night. Hello? Hi, Vanessa, how are you? Okay. I have good news. Jack is looking for an assistant and I mentioned you so can you meet up with him and he'll fill you in? When and where? Drake's Caf at 1:00. Sound good? Okay, thank you. I'll be there. Well I will let him know. I'll call you after the interview. Good luck! Jack. I'm not Vanessa. Vanessa is a very close friend. Jack. I'm not Vanessa. Vanessa is a very close friend. She knew that my husband would never let me leave alive. She knew that my husband would never let me leave alive. Hi Jack. Hi. Thanks for meeting me. I really appreciate what you're doing. Of course, not a problem. Can I get you something? Yeah, I'd love a cup of coffee please. Can we get another cup of coffee please? Thank you. So I don't know how much Heather's told you about the position. I need someone to do some basic filing, bookkeeping, scheduling appointments with clients and generally just keeping me organized which is not always an easy task. That sounds promising. Tell me about yourself. I'm from Boise. I had a bad marriage so I came out here to start over. What did you do in Boise? I'm a travel writer. You'll be able to supply references of course? Absolutely. Why don't you give me your email address and I'll fire that over to you? I don't think that'll be necessary. That was easy. I've got the job already? No it means I know you're lying. What? You can drop the act. I know you're not Vanessa Miller. Now you want to tell me what's really going on? Okay. I'm not Vanessa. Vanessa is a very close friend of mine. She's the only one who witnessed my abusive relationship. She knew that I'd never get away from my ex alive. She left for an extended trip to Europe and she let me assume her identity just long enough to get as far away from my ex as possible without being traced. She's a very good friend, she's very generous, very kind. Where is she now? Still in Europe. I'm so embarrassed. I should have been honest with Heather from the start but you have no idea how frightening it is to be stalked. It terrorizes you. I have no doubt that if my ex knew where I was, he would kill me. I'm sorry but would you excuse me for a second. Sure. I'm sorry. I've been such a fool. Don't be silly. You haven't even told me your real name. It's Carla. Carla Majors. I should go. You must hate me after everything I've done. Of course not. If what you say is true, who could blame you. Come on. I'll walk you to your car. Thank you. What about Heather? You think she'll forgive me? I don't know. You'll have to ask her. She has everything. Excuse me? She has everything. She doesn't need me. She doesn't certainly need me to complicate her life. I wouldn't say that. She's successful, she's smart, she's beautiful. Look at me. I'm a wreck. I think you're being a little hard on yourself. Am I as pretty as Heather? I think you two could pass for sisters. Why don't you let me talk to Heather? It's probably best if I explain the situation to her first. Thanks Jack. I really appreciate it. Sure. Woah. What are you doing? Oh. Oh I'm sorry. You, you were so kind. I just thought that maybe. It's okay. It's fine. Heather is so lucky to have someone like you. Please will you tell her I'm sorry? Sure. Here you are. So that Vanessa is quite a piece of work. So what happened? Well she broke down and fessed up. Her name is Carla Majors and the real Vanessa is a friend of hers who let her borrow her identity while she's off traveling in Europe. Why would she do that? She said to get away from an abusive ex. What do you think? I'm not sure. But I'm checking on the name she gave me and I managed to get some prints off a spoon I took at the restaurant. I'm having the lab run them as we speak so we'll see. What does your gut say? Well either she's a really good actress or she's telling the truth. Either way we'll get the prints back in a couple days and either we get a match or the mystery continues. Anyway enough about Vanessa this is supposed to be our night. Right. And I'm starved. Okay. And I have cooked you up a little surprise. Oh Indian? I don't know. Dinner was so amazing. Yeah? What about the company? The jury's still out on that. Oh really? Ouch. Well maybe this will tip the scales. ...A little help to blur my vision? Who would have thought the two of us... would have connected like this. Hello. Wow. That shirt looks way better on you. Oh thank you. I hope you're not a vegetarian. Oh come on you know I'm a meat eater. That's true. What time is it? Oh almost 10. Oh my god! I have to get the office. Woah. 10 more minutes. At least finish your breakfast. Come on, the world will still be there when you're done. Morning. Uh Heather, I think I recognize that outfit. Don't start. Hey. Saul's on the warpath. Great. What are you doing in here? I'm sorry everyone looked so busy, I didn't want to bother anyone. Heather I'm here to apologize. I misled you. And for that I am so sorry. I should have been honest with you when we met but the stakes were high for me and I didn't know if I could trust you or anyone for that matter. Alright. You have to understand I didn't mean to harm you. I hope you can forgive me and we can start fresh. I really enjoy the friendship we started and I want it to continue. Alright thank you for telling me. You can thank Jack. He was so lovely when we met and he made me feel safe and special when he kissed me. When he kissed you? Oh it was just innocent. He was only trying to make me feel better about myself. Don't worry, I didn't let it go too far. After all I know how you feel about him. Yeah okay, Vanessa I don't want to be rude but I really have to get back to work. You and Jack and I should go for drinks together again sometime. Miss me already? I had an unannounced visitor when I came in this morning. Vanessa. She said that you kissed her. Did you? No. Of course not. I walked her to her car and she tried to kiss me, but I stopped her. Oh, she didn't mention that part. She was upset. I was trying to make her feel better and I guess she misread that and somehow thought there was something between us but there's not, believe me. She seemed so convincing. Look why don't we talk about this later in person and I'll explain everything. I'm waiting for a call on the fingerprints. Thanks. Okay, bye. Ugh. Saul would like to see you in his office. Okay. What's going on Heather? I just got off the phone with Eli. He's not impressed with the way things are going. Now you tell me what the hell is going on. I've just had a few personal issues that I've been dealing with but they're wrapping up. Heather, there is no room for personal issues when millions are at stake. In this case business always trumps personal issues, do you understand? Yes. Perhaps I was a little premature in offering you a partnership. Please just don't worry, I'll fix it. Worry? Fix it? It shouldn't have been broken in the first place. You're right. I'm sorry. I am done talking about it, just go and do what needs to be done. I will. Lisa. My office, five minutes, clear my schedule for the day, we're going over the Boden case. Got it. Hi. Hi babies. Oh, she really loves you two, doesn't she? Come play with me. Come see me! Come see me! Come see me, you two! Come see me! Hi girls. Hi honeys. Don't be such a crybaby. You! You did that?! Why would you do that?! Because you have everything and I have nothing! I don't have everything! Yes you do! You have this house. You have an amazing career. You have money. Friends. Prestige. Fame. Just like when we were in school together. That's right we were in school together. You don't remember that, do you? That's because you were so busy being little miss perfect. Little miss popular. That you didn't even notice me. Well I deserve to be noticed too! And then you stole him. Who? Him. I loved him. And you stole him from me. I don't know what you're talking about Vanessa, please. Shut up! Carson High School. We went to school there remember? Until they took me away. You're not the only one who hurt me, you know? My parents did too. Your parents? Mhm. So I had to kill them. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. That's what the judge said when he threw me in the psycho ward. They put me in that hellhole for years and they rotted my mind with their drugs. And then I saw you on TV. My life had purpose again. You're supposedly such a brilliant lawyer, do you really think that we met by accident? Who do you think phoned you on your cell phone and distracted you while you were driving? There was no dog! Why did you do that? Because ever since I saw you I wanted to be you. Not like you, but to be you. Oh my god. Known. Talked about. Just like when we were in school together. Now I want you to phone Jack and convince him to come over here. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You just call him right now and don't do anything stupid or I will pull this trigger. Hey you. Do you want to come over? What, right now? I miss you. Uh yeah sure, I just have a couple of things to finish up at the office and I'll come right over. Okay I'll see you soon. Bye. And now we wait. Vanessa you don't need to do this. Just walk. Just. Walk. Finally. Alright let's see what we've got. Well hello miss Anna Burrows. No. No. Damnit! Come on, pick up. It's Jack. Don't answer it. Heather it's me, call me back right away. It's Vanessa. See if he left a message. Play it. Heather it's me, call me back right away. It's Vanessa. She's not who she says she is okay. She's dangerous, very dangerous. Well Heather that changes things doesn't it? Heather! Where have you been? I've been trying to call you! Did you get my message? Hey. Are you okay? Hi Jack. Just give me your gun. Slowly. Don't move! Give me your gun honey. Slowly. Okay take it easy. Move away from her. You don't need to do this. I'm so glad you came. I'm so happy to see you. Good, then put the gun down. Don't tell me what to do. All my life people have been telling me what to do. They are not going to do that anymore. Heather. You ruined everything. It was all supposed to be so easy. This life, your life. It was all supposed to be mine and you stole him! Anna! We know who you really are okay? It's over! See, you ruined everything! Well if I can't have him... I enjoyed watching you see Jack die. Now I'm going to enjoy watching you die. We all have to make sacrifices for love, Heather. Good bye. Ugh! I thought you were dead. Okay. Let me call this in. Yeah this is Jack Reilly. I need units at 4101 St. Paul's Road. Code 44. Suspect is dead, thanks. Thank god you're okay. That's for killing my birds! I thought she was dead! What the hell! You think you're so clever. They put me in the psycho ward once before, there's nothing to stop me from getting out again. Good luck with that. I still have that case waiting for me in the south of France. I've heard that's an awful place. Sure would be a shamsi all those vinerds yaone. Yeah wouldn't it. Of course I could always use a good lawyer to make sure I don't break any international laws. Do you need a referral? Actually I kind of already had one in mind counsellor. Oh yeah? Will you come with me? Hmm, let me think about that. Okay.
