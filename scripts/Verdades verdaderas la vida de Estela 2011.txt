The kids have come to play with you, they're having their milk, let's go. Yes, let's go. Sometimes they ask me how I can love someone so much without knowing him, without knowing what he feels, when he laughs, why he suffers. I try to imagine your face; I try on mouths, eyes, gestures.

I can't stand it any longer, Ricardo, I can't stand it anymore! Do you know anything about Claudia? Claudia is all right. Well, if you can consider all right to go from one place to the other, hiding. Don't talk to those people. And who do I talk to? Tell me, who do I talk to? They don't know anything at the police station! They don't know anything at the hospitals! No one knows anything! What do you want me to do? It's been three weeks already! What should I do? Go to bed. You need to rest, we'll discuss it tomorrow, ok? Please! Go to bed, Estela. Ah! Go to bed! Go to bed! This guy! Guido! Honey, Guido. Darling, Guido. Guido! Kids, kids! It's daddy! Come here! Can you, honey? Help me! When those guys released your grandfather, they told him to walk without looking back. He walked a bit, then turned around, looked at them and unbuttoned his jacket because he didn't want to... As he thought they were gonna kill him, he didn't want his jacket to get stained, because he thought I could use it. Then some people he found on the street helped him. The first think he asked for was a comb. To tell you the truth, he came back as a quarter of what he used to be. The night he came back he spent eight consecutive hours telling us about the murders and the tortures he had seen. Then he spoke less and less. I'd like you to take care of him, the small one, Mariana's little brother? Keep him close to you. Hey! Don't run! That one's a menace. Mrs. Estela? Yes. You've got a call. It's Silvia. I'll be right back. Hi! Hi, mom. How is he? Well, he's pulling through. How are you? I've been feeling a bit sick. I have to go to the gynecologist. Err, excuse me, would you give this to Marta. I accidentally took it. Sure. Thank you. A bit sick? Tell me about it. No, not now. I have to go. I love you, guys. We love you, too. Laura! Laura! Leave it, darling. Something happened to her. Leave it. It won't come out. Hello? Hello? Hello? This is a mess! Is it too hard to keep things a little tidy? What are those clothes doing here? Are you all right, darling? Guido! Go ahead, call him. Let's wait. It's Sunday. Chief of the army command. Buenos Aires 1977 Come in. The General is waiting for you. Thank you. May I come in? I am very sorry to bother you. Thank you. I asked your sister for this meeting. We've taught at the same school. It's about my daughter, Laura. It's been weeks since we last heard from her. You know what the problem is, madam? We tell them to turn themselves in voluntarily but... and there's still that disrepute campaign abroad. There are model jails here to get them recovered. If my daughter committed a crime she must stand trial, right? I mean, if she is found guilty of something, she must go to jail. We'll wait for her, all her family will wait for her. That's what you say, madam, but I just came from Uruguay and there, the Tupamaros who are in jail not only get more clung to their ideas but they also end up persuading the jailers. That's not gonna happen here. Here, you gotta do what you gotta do. ...we gotta do it here, madam! Please, sir, please. I don't want to go crazy like other mothers who are looking for her daughter in cemeteries. Don't kill her. And if you have killed her already, please give me the body! How do they call her? Write it down. Do you know her? She's been wandering around here for a while. Good morning. Good morning. Guido? Yes. I don't have much time. I've been kidnapped with Rita. With Laura? She's alive! Yes. Hello! Erminda! How are you? Fine. Go ahead, please. Serve the young lady, she got here first. No, no. I haven't decided yet. Would you show me those again, please? I'll show you, I'll show you. You know my daughter is getting married, right? We're throwing the party at home so we'd like you to give us an estimate. Oh, leave the details, so we can prepare it properly! But could you knock a bit off the price? Certainly, as usual. Thank you very much. Good bye. Where do they have her? It's impossible to know. They take us walled up. What? Blindfolded. But how is she?! She's six-month pregnant. Before they released me, she asked me to tell you to look for the baby in Casa Cuna by mid June. She thinks they're gonna leave him there. Why? Why there? Why don't they leave him with us? Let her talk. She said that, if he was a boy, she wants him to be named Guido, after you. Oh, darling, she's alive! She's alive! Casa Cuna, La plata 1978 Madam, you cannot come in here, you're putting my job at risk. I'm sorry. I've already asked. The baby that was brought yesterday was picked up this morning. Picked up? Where did they take him? Children come and go all the time. A judged ordered his adoption. A judge? Do you know his name? I can't give you that information. It's confidential. I'll have to ask you to leave, madam, please. Law Courts, Buenos Aires, 1978 I apologize. The judge was at a meeting, you know. I was not allowed to interrupt him. That's what took us so long. Look, I told him what you said to me and the truth is, Your Honor said that the best you can do is stop looking. What? look, if you keep looking, you'll end up getting in trouble. You might end up in a ditch. What? Just that. Did he say that? Look, I need to go. Did he say that? I have to go. Excuse me. The girl told me to ask there. Some kids might be left at Casa Cuna but most of them What? They are more than one would imagine. They say kidnappers themselves or military men's relatives take them. I also went to Casa Cuna and nothing. But I don't know where to ask anymore. I know but still, we have to keep asking. The same happens to us because no one pays any attention, you know, politicians. Not even priests, go figure. That's why we have to be there. Stay firm and not leave them alone until they tell us where they are! We're going to Plaza de Mayo tomorrow. Do you dare, Estela? Laura? Tomorrow I'm going to Plaza de Mayo with some women, you know? I took it already. No, you didn't. I'm not sure if I'm going crazy but today, in the street... Oh, call the kids. Dinner's ready. Plaza de Mayo, Buenos Aires 1978 Hi. Move along, move along! You are not allowed to be here. Move along, move along! Come on, madam, come on, move along, move along! I can't, Beba, I can't do this. No, no, don't be afraid. That's what they want. Walk, listen to me, walk. Hello? Yes, it's me. Would you give me the address, please? We'll be right there. Do you think they have her here? Will they give us the baby? Madam, gentlemen, the Captain is waiting for you. Come in, please. Do you know this person? It's our daughter. She was intercepted in Route 3, she was accompanied by a man. She was commanded to halt, she answered with a fire gun. Your daughter died in a confrontation. How did she die? She died, madam, died, died! She was killed! She was killed! It's OK. Calm down, please. Darling...! What did you do with the baby? There's no baby, madam, there's no baby. Do you want your daughter's body? Sign this paper and it's yours. Right now, OK? It's done, come on. What do you mean there's no baby? Sign this paper and take it, please! It's done. I'll ask you to leave, please. This, sir. You're right on time. One more second and I would have taken it. If you also wanna take the kid No, no. We don't know who he is, what the fuck are you saying? No one knows. Cover her, Ricardo, please! It's cold! It's OK. No! It's OK. No! Ready. As good as new. Thanks, darling. What for? What for? Did she fit in there? She looked older, didn't she? Throw everything away. Laura? Laura? Laura? Laura? He's right. He must go. What's he gonna do? He'll be safe in Sweden with Claudia. I haven't finished! But if he stays we could at least see him from time to time. Living with the military, do you know what could happen to him when they found out he's a Carlotto? We have to get him abroad, no matter what! "Serving the country" What country? Couldn't you find a worse one, huh This one sucks! It sucks! Look! We've been discussing it with your father and you're right, Kibo. You should flee. It's the best. You'll be safer. Listen to this! Listen to this sound! It's a tin! Look! Look! This sucks, mom, it sucks! Stop it! Please! We all miss her! All of us! What are you doing there in the cold? Did you take your pills? I think so. I think so? That's what I need! You getting sick! And I was right! It's bent! Everything's bent. Municipal Cementery. La Plata 1979 No one knows anything. Somebody has to know something, Sir. You're here all day. People come and go all the time. You must have seen someone. No, I didn't see anything. But listen to me, please! I need to know where my daughter is! What do you want me to tell you? I don't know anything, madam. Please! I need to find my daughter! That's what I am here for! I don't know anything, madam! OK, ask the manager. Easy, we're both here, easy. Defense Counsel of Human Rights. San Pablo 1980 Well, we are permanently meeting there in Buenos Aires. And, well, we've been to Chile and Uruguay, and our work clearly shows that children in those two countries. The committee's actions will be performed in all South America. Luckily, we have the support of the archbishopric. Ha! The archbishopric? Yes. Where I was held under arrest, there were many pregnancies. Most of the times, babies were delivered and were killed. Not all of them. Some of them survived! True. I remember one of them. The day they released her, I gave her a black lace bra. And I told her to take it as a souvenir. What a stupid thing to say, Her father had a paint shop or something like that. They took her away for the delivery and took her back alone and asleep. When she woke up Sometimes they took her out. They took her out? To the streets, for a ride, so that she... ...would point at a fellow. But she wouldn't betray anyone. You're talking about my daughter, Laura. They killed her. And the baby? What happened to the baby? She had a healthy boy! Guido. These are the frst of Argentine landing in Puerto Argentino at Islas Malvinas... I'm going to bed. Go. Bye, dad. The attacks began at midnight. The sky was covered by missiles... ones of many planes crashed in the Malvinas War... that the enemy is unable to recognize... Are you in a better mood now? The thing is that customers don't pay and I'm not that good at numbers. The Army was able to hoist our flag again in the southern territory... showing it's millitary power... Where's that thing? Fucking shit! Hey, what's wrong? Turn it off, please. Dear Remo: So many things happened and we haven't been able to talk. We have to be confident. All this massacre and persecution cannot last forever. Today, I regret not having strengthened our relationship. I would really like you to feel that I'm your friend and that you can tell me all about you. Daddy told me you're not playing tennis anymore. Why? Did you get bored? Don't let life get you down. You have to be strong and optimistic. I love you and miss you a lot. Don't stop writing to me. Laura. Kibo! I was stopped at customs in Asuncin and the policeman looks at me and says don't you know you cannot bring animals here? Animals? What did you have? The thing is I had bought a charango and had it with me all day. They were talking about you. He was actually talking to the charango. Leave her alone, don't be silly. OK, OK, OK Our return was also complicated. Besides, at Ezeiza... They're watching us! Who? Where? Right there! Don't look! Let's go. Let's go. There, don't look, mom. We're leaving one at a time. You go first. I'll take the girl. I'm staying with the girl, all right? OK No one is leaving this place. What? Pay the check, darling. Estela. Tell her to stay here, dad. I can't. Mom! Why didn't you stop her? Hi. Yes, madam. How are you? May I speak to the Doctor, please? Oh, all right, all right. Yes, Mrs. Carlotto. Tell him to call me. Tell him that, err... we're here at the Capital with my family, with my children, who have just come to Argentina to legalize and that, well, we're here, having a good time at a bar and there are some people who look like they're from the services and they're watching us. Oh, thanks. All right, tell him that we're now going home, to La Plata and please ask him to inform that we're being followed, yes. If we don't call you back in two hours, please submit an habeas corpus. That's right. Well, thank you very much, madam. Good afternoon.

My fellow was going to the train station. At that time, we lived in Florida. Three cars blocked her on the street. I managed to see everything but I couldn't help. She was pregnant with Francisco.

Don't clam up like that. Say what you think. Lea, you're always seeing it half empty. I'm fine. How are you? Very well. At least I see something. But if we say A you say Z. You're like that, Lea, somebody has to tell you! What's wrong? Is it el Tano? Now you want to write letters. You can read me like a book. No, Ivonne, I didn't say that. Every time I leave the house, he makes a scene. Talk then. What's the point of talking? He looks like a different person. I always see the glass half empty. Everything I say is useless! I can't tell him anything. I can't get angry because it's not his fault but it also breaks my heart. Estela, could you please tell Lea to be clearer and to speak? Don't look for allies! We're all allies! Or is anyone breaking away? I suppose you're referring to me, aren't you? No. But you're always objecting to everything. You doubt if we're doing things right or if you're going to find your grandson. Don't you ever doubt? Yes but I cannot just sit down and do nothing! I'm home. What are you doing, honey? What's up? Everything's misplaced. Am I doing the right thing, honey? Today I was thinking "there are lots of grandmothers now". What if I just quit? We could spend more time together. ata! Don't you even think about that! I'm getting a strong presbyopia, too. Oh, thanks. You know, this hand goes numb and this one itches as if I had an allergy or something. Are you OK, Lea? Yes, yes. You stood up so suddenly. Oh, well, I have a bit of a headache, Estela. Yesterday I... No, it's OK. I was too nervous. I wasn't feeling well. We all feel the same. Do you forgive me? There's nothing to forgive, Estela. Come here. What? Here, look. Let me see. It doesn't show. What should I do? I'd have it cut a bit. Come here. Look. Oh, and with no glasses!

It's as if I had never said goodbye! The military is going to insist on the confrontation, Claudia! You'll see. When they stand trial, they're going to say what they always say. That Guido does not exist! What are you thinking about, mom? That we should ask for the disinterment. When I heard about the pregnancy, I hit my head against the wall. I wanted her to have a miscarriage. They were the worst news I could hear. And now I regret it, right? But I was afraid of what they could do to her body in that condition. But she clung to her pregnancy and to you and you managed to live through it together. They could steal bodies, break them, throw them into the river but they couldn't destroy certain things, certain dreams. Your mother's dream was you Municipal Cementery. La Plata 1985 She received two almost simultaneous shots at a distance of 30 centimeters approximately: One in her womb and one in the nape. Any of the shots would have been enough to kill her.
