I'd like it to be you Her name is Kyoko, she loves you" If she were just another woman... but she's not. She's another world... You see what I mean? What's that? A lesson... At this hour? What's that: your violin? I'm going. I'll get Alphonse tomorrow Listen, I'll sleep in the chair... you can have the bed Not in the same room! All right! Not in the same room! What a mess! You left without waking me this morning! Mind if I kiss Alphonse? We had to talk... remember? We'll always have time to talk! Besides, I was late for work Your parents are coming for dinner... and to see the baby Didn't you say no? How could I? You're out of your mind! I haven't told mother... Call them! Call it off!

We invited ourselves Here, take this... Let's see Alphonse What's that? A duck for Alphonse - Anything wrong? - I'm fine... I'm fine! The duck isn't for you! You see, I just read a novel called: "The Mischievous Duck" It's about a judge who falls in love... with a duck, like this... his son's toy! Couldn't happen to Antoine He loves people, not things... though he's very partial to yellow! Just look at him! He's cute! He's grown... Look at the duck! Come to mama... He wants to walk... watch! He's too young! He is not amused! I'll call you Good... Sorry about tonight... I was tired We all were... Don't catch cold Help me with the mattress Must we do this? If I sleep next to you... the world won't end! I'm not like you! I hate what is vague... elusive... ambiguous... I like what is clear! Don't come near me... don't touch me! That's the way you want it! All right! Goodbye! TUESDAY THURSDAY SATURDAY I don't know what I'm going to do You're living alone? More or less... Doesn't it bother you? I don't mind solitude When I'm alone... at night... I'm afraid I'd marry a streetlight if it could talk! Oh, it's you... Antoine came yesterday, so... Believe me, he'll come back I don't think so I handled it badly Instead of smoothing it over... I panicked and made it worse It takes patience. All men are children I thought you loved her? Very much! At first I couldn't get over her good manners So polite! Funny, yet touching... Then it got on my nerves! "Thank you for this..." "Thank you for that..." "Thanks one and all!" I called her "Peggy Proper" Peggy, because of her British reserve.... Proper, because she was! Know what I mean? I was a virgin... I'm not proud of it! I dated as much as I wanted But I was scared and ignorant... Imagine: a virgin at 20! I was a living anachronism! I had false ideas about life, too... But it is fascinating! No, the truth is... that life is disgusting! You should see her smoke! She doesn't know how Like an awkward little girl... acting grown up! He's really funny And I'm never bored, with him Those colds of his! At first, when he'd sniffle... I wanted to say: "Blow your nose!" Now, when he doesn't sniffle... I think he's sick! My husband! Was Alphonse good? Fine! He smiles and blows kisses... You noticed... Did you see his tooth? A little tooth! I packed your summer clothes I'll get them another time Hook me up. I'm late... He's playing with a program, okay? No! He'll tear it I went to the ballet... What's written on it? Nureyev's autograph... We went backstage afterwards That's so provincial! Bothering a guy who's danced for 2 hours! Now don't start that! I'm ready to baby-sit Am I too early? I can come back... Not at all! To baby-sit A taxi, please: 17 rue Descazes Six minutes?... Thank you I'm going out... But you can stay with Alphonse... I'll walk you down Goodnight... Be good Watch TV if you like Take care of him Here, this is yours I gave it to you It's yours! Remember how you used to say: "Take your keys in case we fight?" You're in a good mood Surprised? Coming here, you think... "She's going to yell at me again!" - Admit it! - It's not so! - You mustn't... - Oh? I thought... I just thought... Let me go! I was just helping... I don't need help! You're a pain! A real pain! All you know is what you want! A kiss when you want it! Solitude when you want it! I'm not "yours to command!" Not any more! Shut up! I'm sorry... I understand... Oh, I know that line: "I'm too rotten..." "for a girl like you!" I'd never pull that You have... 100 times! Put it in your novel! Well, the truth is... it's all I think about That's why I'm so fouled up Once it's done, we'll get along better Don't send me a copy, I won't read it You're getting even with your parents... washing dirty linen in public I'm not smart but I know this! Writing to settle old scores... isn't art! I've wondered about that That's what's bothering me Do what you must but leave me alone I've never had much pride, so... I can say this: I still love you But I'd rather not see you You can see the baby, but I won't be home The taxi's coming... Where's that cab? They said 6 minutes... Anyway, I hope you're happy I don't think about it It can't work. We hardly talk now You can always smile That's all we do! By evening, I have lock-jaw... from smiling! Restaurants are hell! Between courses... I'm expected to make small talk I can't even eat! It's awful... She thinks I've gone away for 3 days I pity you! Where you going? I don't know... Can I drop you off? No, I'm okay... Just a minute Do you want me to stay with you? Want to go to a movie? No, I'll just go for a walk You're sweet... Kiss me... You are my sister, my daughter, my mother... I'd hoped to be your wife... Wait for me here... No, no... I'll be right back! Don't you like any of them? I didn't know it was like this... It's very simple: You look and choose... then... Follow me... It's slow, right now We used to be busy till the 23rd Now, everyone's broke by the 15th The Administration! When I saw them on TV, I knew we'd had it! Not interested in politics? A little... Anyway, I agree with you: They're all bums Some bums cost us more than others "If you don't follow politics..." "politics will get you in the end!" The end of the month, the ends to an end... the end of a film... I hate all endings! What's that? Nothing... I said... you are especially beautiful Walking in your sleep? Glad to see you... Nothing like a good house... to complete a happy home! - I owe you 100, right? - Me?.. No! Where are you? In a restaurant - And? - And nothing... Nothing special... I just wanted to talk to you Anything wrong? It's just that... I'm with someone Mademoiselle Butterfly? Right... I can't take it! She never talks... she just keeps smiling! She expects me to amuse her... to tell her jokes... I've had it! Tonight, I'm not even trying... Don't be mean It was good talking to you Did you make your call? You should have started - Finished? - What's next? - Some cheese? - No thanks... Sorry! Cheese... I have another call to make Excuse me It's me again Still eating? Yes. It's deadly... as I expected Is the food good? Rumpsteak?.. In silence! Each minute counts triple Feels like I've been here all day! Try to talk to her I'm too bored to try! I just want to beat it!.. And she's ordering cheese! But if she orders dessert... I'll kill myself! Cheese? That one's very good Excuse me... another phone call... Our coffee? Not yet. After dessert... Bring the check with the coffee At the same time! It's me again She just doesn't understand! Now it's a souffle... 20 minutes! Are you there? I'm here... Say something I'm listening You know... I'm listening I can't say it now... I'd like to kiss you Me too... Tenderly Me too... Is that true? It's true DROP DEAD! ONE YEAR LATER... Say "Papi"... Go back inside I'm coming! I'm very late...
