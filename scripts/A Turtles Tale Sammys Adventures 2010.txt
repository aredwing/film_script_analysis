That was my old mate Ray back there. He almost got himself run over. Huh! We were born on this very same beach, some fifty years ago, and we've been mates ever since. Today is a special day, we're both going to be granddads. Imagine that! 'It could take awhile before the little ones hatch though, 'so, let me take you back in time, 'and tell you about our first encounter with the humans. 'There was a time when this beach was practically deserted. 'Nothing out here but us turtles, 'and the sound of those beautiful waves.' Ohh! (Seagulls screeching) Oh! Ohh! Ohh! Hey, come on, you need to hustle a flipper! I can't get out! Let's go... to the water. We're wasting time. See you in 30 years! Or not! Ohh! Oomph! Ohh! (Sighs) (Seagulls screeching) Hello... hello? Is anybody up there? 'I was only five minutes old and already I had the sinking feeling 'that I was not going to make it.' (Screeches) Ahh! (Squawks) Help, let me go! Ah! Oh! Ohh! Oh-ho, oh! Hi there! Watch out! Ahh! WOO! That was well cool with those birds, eh? It was as if we were flying! - (Groans) - You know, you don't look too good. (Groans) - Can you move? - Huh? We have to get going. We've got some good waves coming in now. Come on, we gotta go, Shelly! Birds are everywhere! Wait, we have to help him! Come on, Shelly. There's nothing more you can do for him. Shelly? Oh! Come on, don't give up. You can still make it! You have to try. Get up, I'll help you. (Screeching) Ah, let go! Help me, help! Shelly? (Gasps) (Sighs) Oh! 'And so it began for me. 'A little nudge to start me off. 'Nonetheless, I was on my way.' Let this love be a fading sky We could drift all night to the new sunrise Because we'll be free I know you know you're free Feels so good to be free Mm-mm, baby Free There's nothing in between What we are, what we've seen What we are We are just free Free Free... (Grunts) Oh! Ohh! Ohh! Oh, hi there, new to the current? Hatched yesterday. You're awful young to be alone out here. It can get really scary. Scary? It is a big pond out here, in case you hadn't noticed! Lots of creatures out to get you, as you'll find out soon enough. - Find out what? - Where do I start? - Well, what about barracuda? - Barra what? Cudas, fastest predator in the ocean! - And you got your Great Whites! - White? Faster than the fastest, they are, and big teeth, too. Oh, never mind them. Just go with your instincts, and you'll be fine. No reason to be scared. I'm not scared. Well you should be! You're not even a snack for most creatures out here! Just follow your instincts, and good luck on your journey. What am I supposed to be looking for? When you find out, let us know! And watch out for the nets. If they get you, you're turtle soup! And watch out for the plastic. Seaweed good, plastic bad. OW! What did you do that for? Do I look like food to you? Oh, crazy fish! What a way to start the journey. Hmm. Ah! How's it going, guys? Looking mighty cosy up here. - Get off, you big oaf. - (All) Yeah! Who put a dent in your shell? He's gonna eat all our food. - Yeah! - Yeah! - Get out of here! - Yeah. Go! We don't need some eating machine hanging around! Sling your hook! I wouldn't ride on your stupid whatever, if you were the last turtles in the ocean! - Good! - Go away! Hiya, fellas. Hoy-oy-oy, don't even think about it! Beat it! All right, I'm not one of your kind. Got that right! - Hey, watch out! - Ow! Ah, this is not my day! Now why'd you whack me upside my head? But, I... Lucky I didn't pass out! Look at that! Got a bump the size of a barnacle. Probably get bigger, take over my whole head. I, I, I don't think it will... You ever seen them barnacles? You let 'em hitch a ride with you, they never leave, bunch of freeloaders! Hello? Oh! Goodbye. What is that thing you're on anyway? You make it? Oh, I fell on it. It's a long story. How's your bump? Ah, no worries. Us Leathers got heads like rocks. The name's Ray. Sammy. Pleased to meet you. How long you been on the journey? - Just one day. - Me too! Caught the drift up north. - So did I! - Say! We have a lot in common, you and me. - Would you like to hop on? - Nah, I'm OK. Oh, OK. It was a joke! You know, seeing how we're supposed to be floatin' around until we grow up and all, this little raft of yours could come in handy. This ain't bad. Now, you're sure about this? I don't wanna get all friendly like and then you go crackers on me one day,, - and wanna kick me off. - I wouldn't do that. Besides, we were hatched on the same day, probably on the same beach! We're practically brothers. Brothers... I like that. Ah, the sun feels good, doesn't it? I like laying out in the sun. it's good for my skin, cos you know, when a turtle, you know, gets all dried up, everything gets all ugly and flaky, but I like that. I like that, it's good to have a turtle tan. 'And that's how I met Ray. 'He was definitely a character. 'Always fun and never at a loss for words. 'For ten years or so our life in the open sea, 'consisted mainly of floating and waiting.' You should try some. it's good! You've got to be kidding. My taste buds are a little more refined. (Laughs) That's what you call refined? Hoo, I love 'em! (Burps) They do gimme gas though. (Laughs) I'm feeling happy And warm all over I hold you in my hand And you spillover So come on, we're having a good time We're happy people, We're having the best time ever We're happy people, Oh-oh Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh... 'You know, despite all the stories I heard, 'the ocean didn't seem like a scary place after all.' I'm the way it should be So come on, we're having a good time We're happy people, We're having the best time ever We're happy people, oh-oh Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Horn blasts) - Why don't you take a look around - (Both laugh) Take a look all around you I'm feeling happy Take a look around And warm all over Take a look all around I hold you in my hand Take a look around And you spill over... 'It was a pretty great life out here. 'Time just seemed to fly by. 'Before we knew it we had... Well, we had grown up. 'Well, almost grown up, that is.' Oh, this is the life, my friend. No gas problems today, Ray? I'm feelin' pretty good. By the way, did you notice those two cuties leaving - when we were comin' in? - Nope, didn't see them. Come on, they were checking you out! - No, they weren't. - Oh, yeah. Hey, do you think we'll be pals forever? Of course, forever and ever. - Don't you? - Definitely. But, at some point, now I'm not saying now, but, some time in the future, well, we're gonna have to choose a mate, right? OK. So? Have you ever thought about finding that someone special? I suppose. So, what's your type? - I don't know. - Come on, everybody's got a type. For me, she's gotta have a great laugh, and of course, share my thing for jellyfish. Of course. You still haven't told me what your type is? Actually, I met someone once that I think could be my type. Oh, really? Well, come on, come on, this is major! You gotta tell me! You're gonna make more of it than it actually was. You already made more of it! OK. - Her name's Shelly. - Go on. She was... she was kind of sweet. Mm. Where'd you meet her? She was um... an important part of my early life. What? We met a day after you hatched, been together ever since, and she's a big part of your life? - She is! - Mm? - Was. - Well, OK, I want all the juicy details. There are no juicy details. Start talkin' or I don't stop bugging you. OK, OK, fine. - Come on, I'm listening. - (Laughs) Wow, that was some story. You saved her life. It was more of an accident. The birds collided. You spit sand in that bird's face. You saved her life! I don't even know if she made it. There you are, you never know. It's a small ocean out there. Maybe someday me and you'll run into her. - Maybe. - (Both) Ah! - Whoo! - Ha-ha, is this great or what? Better than great! 'Ray was truly the best friend I could have hoped for. 'He was always fun. 'Always good humoured and always looking for new adventures. 'One thing though, I could have done without his stinky jellyfish.' (Crash) (Groans) (Alarms) (Crash) 'Come on, don't give up.' You can still make it! You have to try. Get up! - Come on Sammy, get up! - Oh! It's about time you woke up. What? Oh. What have you been doing? Exploring! Made friends with a cool old octopus. You gotta check him out. Have you eaten yet? I'll get something on the wing. Picky, picky, picky. Where are you taking me to? You'll see, we're almost there. Hey, Slim! Well, hello! Grab on, boys! Come on, Sammy, you're not scared, are you? No, of course not. Come on then! it's gonna be fantastic! - Welcome aboard. - Here we go! Pick a tentacle, any tentacle. Fasten your seatbelts, it's going be a bumpy ride. Here we go! Round and round and round. Love it! I Teach you to carry on I Watch now, but now it's gone away... I Oh! Woo-hoo. So was that fun or what? My head's still spinning. - Where's everybody going? - Whoa, we've got a situation here! What's going on? It doesn't look good. - Smells bad too. - Oh! What is this stuff? It's all around us! We'd better take cover! We'll be safe in here... I think. Slim, you ever seen anything like this? No, not like this. However, I do remember a cargo ship once ran aground on some rocks, and dropped a whole batch of Icelandic bananas! These aren't bananas. Most certainly not. Oh. Good lord, that's disgusting! I'll wager a guinea that that ship is rammed to the gunnels with the stuff. You chaps should head out, it's not safe staying around here. What about you, Slim? Oh, Slim'll be fine. I like staying put. I'm a hermit, not the crab, you understand. But anyway, I've got a lot of cleaning up to do. Take care my turtle friends. - Thanks. - Take care of yourself! This looks horrible. It was so beautiful here. Why would anybody do this to us? I don't know, it doesn't make any sense at all. (Helicopter) 'Humans were strange creatures. 'Some made a mess, while others cleaned it up. 'That was our first contact with humans. 'It wouldn't be our last. 'Over the years, I learned that many things would change, 'but one thing was always a constant. 'People would affect our lives 'more and more.' (BANG!) Wow, what was that? That hurt my ears. Look at that! What is it? Some kind of aliens? No, humans. They're everywhere. I think we need to get out of here. This is a little too close for comfort. Hey! What did ya do that for? There's no room on here, especially for your stinky jellyfish. What are you talking about? We can't even move on here any more. Maybe I should just take my jellyfish and hit the current myself! Then you could stretch out and have all the space to yourself. - I wasn't saying you had to... - Whoa... Uh-ooh! Well, there you go. I guess we won't have to worry about being crowded any more, now will we! Look, Ray, I... What? What's the rush, guys? Oh, Ray! The net, it's got me! Hold on, I'll get you out of there. Don't panic. I'll tear this thing up. I already tried. It's too hard! I can't bite through it! Ah! - Ray! - Sammy! Wait for me here! I'll find a way out. I'll be right here, Sammy! You hear me? Right here! Ah, they got me. - Sammy? - Ray? We'll get out of this. 'That was the first time that I saw real fear on Ray's face.' - Sammy! - 'I was pretty scared myself) Sammy! Oh! Ohh! (Grunts) Ohh! Oh! Whoa! Oh! Ah. Oh! Ahh! (Grunts) (Sighs) Oh, Ray. 'This was one of those times I could've used a little luck, 'one of those little nudges. 'I had the feeling I was never going to see Ray again.' Gotta be thirty degrees out here. Away with you, I'll give it 35. What you got there then, boy? It's a little greenback. Think we should we make some soup? - (Both laugh) - That little boy's overcooked already! Chuck him! (Both continue to laugh) (Groans) Oh-ho-ho If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea I'll sail the world to find you If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see I'll be the light to guide you To find out what we're made of When we are called to help our friends in need You can count on me, like one, two, three, I'll be there And I know when I need it, I can count on you, like four, three, two You'll be there Cos that's what friends are supposed to do, oh, yeah... Hey, what's this? Oh, isn't he a cute little turtle? See turtle, Fluffy? - See? - He looks so scared, doesn't he? We'll get him some food, and we'll take real good care of him. OK? Fluffy, turtle eat food. And it's time for your dinner, too. (French accent) OK, let's get one thing straight, little turtle. - these are my humans. - I didn't ask to be here. Your humans brought me here. If I may suggest, you should plan on getting your little shell out of here as soon as possible, unless of course, you prefer to end up like my ex-amis, ze chicken. - Chicken? - Absolument! Whose playpen do you think this was? They eat animals? But she seems so nice. Do not let the mumsy-wumsy attitude fool you. She will stuff you like a goose, then, it is r-r-r, pt for everyone. Shh, here she comes now! Here you go, little man. You are so skinny. We need to fatten you up, don't we? Come here, don't be afraid. Do not forget. You have been warned. Bon apptit! "You have a strange way, Ralph, "of proving that the world has grown smaller. "So, because you can go round it in three months..." "In eighty days," interrupted Phileas Fogg. "That's true, gentlemen," added John Sullivan. "Only eighty days, now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad, on the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, has been opened. So, have you given any more thought to your escape? You are starting to look like ze fat goose more and more every day. Ze time will come. it's a sure thing. You and your chicken stories! Is it true? Can you really go around the world? But of course you can! I myself have travelled all over with my humans. Since they rescued me from the murky waters of the Seine in Paris, oo-la-la, it has been magnifique! So, wait, there are other oceans out there? 'One day, Snow found a female turtle. I think she wanted us to...' Mate! You've got to be kidding! I suppose she wants more turtles. I know what mating is. That is so not happening. And who's your hairy friend? That's Fluffy. These are his humans. Exactement! You just stay away from my humans, sister. Oh, you can keep your humans as far as I'm concerned. Bunch of wack-a-doodle-doo creatures! The further away from them I am, the better. Tell me, sugar, how long have they been holding you prisoner? I'm not a prisoner. Really, then why are you still here? This is the same question I have been asking for weeks! Back off, whiskers. Let me break it down for you. Where I come from, this here fence looks a lot like a prison, but, OK, believe what you will if it makes you feel better. Fluffy! Dinner calls! bientt! - I'm Sammy. - Vera. Speaking of dinner, I am starving! Do they just feed hairball or us, too? Yeah, when the sun goes down. Beautiful! Don't make any sudden moves on me. Go ahead and give us a wake-up call when it's time to eat, will you? (Yawns) (Sitar music plays) There you go. You'll be our little peace ambassador. Merry Christmas, little man. Hey, what did she paint on my shell? Turn around, let me see. It is zat, stupid... ze sign! What can I say. I have told you. You are marked, mon ami. Oh, there you go again with the chicken and the funny words routine. Never mind him, Sammy. It looks cute on you. Why do you think they dress up like that with those silly hats? Incroyable! You really don't get it? Because it's Christmas! You get presents. Hey, maybe this mark is Snow's present to me. Doubtful. In any event, don't get any ideas, Monsieur Hard Shell. She is only being nice because it's Christmas. Jingle bells Jingle bells Jingle all... 'I still don't know if Fluffy's chicken story was true or not. 'I wanted to believe Snow was a kind human and wouldn't do that to me. 'But you never knew, when it came to humans. 'It didn't take long before the hippies realised, 'Vera and I weren't going to mate. 'They said we had different karmas... 'or auras - whatever they were.' Zat should be you out there. Hold on, I thought you liked Vera? Vera's too old and too tough for turtle soup. But you... - Ow! - ..I'd say you were just about right! Vera! (Man) None of you kids belong on this beach! I want you all off here now! Snow, they're taking Sunshine away! (Sirens) The cops! The army! They're shipping them out to Vietnam! (Man) You with the love beads, start that bus up. Vite, vite, go, go, go! What's going on? You, you're coming with us. This is it, it's chicken time. You have to hide now! They did the same thing before. They... you know what I mean. Stay put, and don't move. You don't want to end up as fricassee, do you? (Man) All right, shake a leg. Come on, get out of it. (Young man) We have rights, man. (Snow) Wait. Where's the little man? Has anybody seen him? I can't find him. Quiet. (Man) Right, you horrible lot, everybody get off this beach. Get your stuff and move out! (Sirens) Have a good life little turtle! Peace. 'The whole time I was with the humans, Fluffy wanted to get rid of me, 'but in the end, it was them who left. 'I never quite understood what happened.' - All the leaves are brown - All the leaves are brown I - And the sky is grey I - And the sky is grey - I've been for a walk - I've been for a walk - On a winter's day - On a winter's day - I'd be safe and warm - I'd be safe and warm - If I was in L.A. - If I was in L.A. - California dreaming - California dreaming On such a winter's day Stopped into a church I passed along the way - Well I got down on my knees - Got down on my knees - And I pretend to pray - I pretend to pray... Mm. Hm! Oh, hey, excuse me. You wouldn't know where I could find some food, sea weeds? (Sighs) 'At that point I thought, maybe I wasn't meant to go on this journey. 'Maybe I'd spent too much time with the humans. 'But there was no turning back now.' Oh! (Grunts) Argh! Well, well, well, look what the trash brought in! Vera! I see you escaped one prison and got yourself all tangled up in another. I'm so glad to see you. Yeah, lots of rubbish out here. Got to be careful. What brings you here? - Food. - Yeah! Follow me. What did I tell you? This is just what I needed. (Faint) Help! Hold on a sec, what's that noise? - I didn't hear anything. - (Faint) Oh, oh! - This is so tasty! - (Screams) Shh! Ah-ha! Shark! Help! Help! (Screams) Oh! - Are you hurt? - He bit me pretty hard but I'm fine. He's coming back. Quick, this way. Hurry, he's gaining on us. Quickly. Here. - (Screams) - Oh! Quick! In here. . Oh! . Oh! Ohh! Quick, no! - Keep going! - Oh! Faster, faster! - Ohh! - (Screams) Come on, keep going! (Both gasping) Keep going! Down here! Ohh! That was close! Too close. (Screams) Leave us alone! Hey you, big teeth! That's right, hot shot! I got your scaly botty on my radar! You picked the wrong turtle to be messing with! Ohh, you want some of this? (Grunts) Is that all you've got? I'm gonna call you the Great Wimp not the Great White! Ah! - Oh, no! - Vera! Hey, you think that hurts? What? Please! That's all you got? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna make cat food out of you, pal! Look at you, I've got one tough shell, fish breath! You heard me. And don't make me swim after you! Woo, that felt good. No need to worry about mister shark any more. You were incredible! Are you two related? No, we're just friends, well, sort of. Well, got to go. Feed the boy, cos, a fat turtle is a happy turtle. Take care you two. You know, you don't look too good. Are you OK? 'Don't give up. You can still make it! You have to try.' (Gasps) You're... Wait, you're... you're Shelly! How do you know my name? Is this a dream? No, I, I don't think so. Are you the same "fell out of a bird's beak when you were hatched," Shelly? Just a minute. (Gasps) I knew you looked familiar, too! You saved my life - twice! What? No! The first time was an accident. That was no accident, that was fate. You know, I don't even know your name. Sammy. Well, Sammy, this is incredible! It is, isn't it? How's your shell? It's just a scratch. Are you as hungry as I am? Famished! 'Life is strange. 'Just when you thought the going was pretty tough, 'out of the blue things happen, 'and everything's suddenly great again.' Hey, Shell, you ever get bored just drifting, going round in circles? It's what we do. I know, but wouldn't it be great just to travel around the world? What do you mean? This is our world. I think there's a lot more than these waters. For instance? Well, the humans talk about ice oceans and strange islands. I want to see them! You're definitely a different type of turtle. - I guess that's why I like you. - (Gasps) You like me? What's not to like? So, just how exactly do you plan on seeing the world? Have you ever heard about a secret passage? You really think one exists? - I do. - The humans again? Maybe they made that whole thing up. Maybe, but I want to do something no one else has done. I want to see the world, ice oceans! So, you wanna come along with a weirdo turtle like me? Is this a proposition, Sammy? Yes, I suppose it is. - I'd love to go with you. - (Gasps) Really? It's not every day you get a chance to see the world, right? How do we find this secret passage? I'm not sure. Let's head south, we'll ask around. 'Everything suddenly fell into place. 'I had a purpose, a journey. 'And best of all, someone to share it with.' Destiny is a funny thing We hear people say things are meant to be... All I know is that I see a lot of ships heading that way. A secret passage? That, I couldn't tell you. I stay as far away from those humans as possible. That must be the way! I feel it! I feel it, too! Good luck! Never to feel love And you will see that nothing at all is impossible Because love will find a way... There's loads of boats. I don't see any secret passage. Let's move on. Of course he's not crazy! We have a plan. We want to see the world. Thanks anyway. This is not as easy as I thought. Wait! Over there! Because mountains and valleys may come between us But time nor space will ever defeat us And you will see that nothing at all is impossible... This is not the secret passage. Look at all this nasty stuff around here. This can't be it. I think you're right. (Birdsong) Taste the water! - It's sweet! - Wait! I remember the humans mentioned something about sweet water - flowing through the secret passage. - Do you think we're close? Yeah! This must be it. Let's check it out. It's so different and so beautiful. It's amazing! (Bird call) Wow, did you see that? There's birds everywhere! We've got to be careful. Look at that! I've never seen a snake that big in the ocean. Maybe he's the guardian of the secret passage. - (Hisses) - Let's keep going. That is one strange looking beast. It looks like a real monster. (Gasps) Did you see that? - What? - I'm not sure. I feel like we're being followed. (Gasps) Sammy? Ohh! I don't think they're anything to worry about. They're not that big. OW! Ah! True, unless you count the fact they have a whole lot of nasty teeth... There seem to be quite a lot of them. (Growls) - (Growls) - (Scream) See, I told you they were... - Ah! - Sammy! Let me go! Ahh! Ahh! (Grunts) Why did you bring me up here? - (Cheeping) - Ow! OW! Ow! Stop it! Ow! Cut it out! (Gasps) - (Cheeping) - Ahh, cut it out! (Chainsaw) (Screams) Great! Now how do I get down? Oh! (Ship horn) (Sawing continues) Ohh! (Screams) Oh! Sammy, I was so frightened! I thought I'd lost you forever. (Gasps) Duck! Maybe looking for the secret passage is a bad idea! I think I know where it is! When I was up in that tree, I saw all these big ships heading towards a place in the distance. I think we're close. Really close! (Ship horn) We made it! You were right! Yeah, and getting through is gonna be another story. Sammy, you're too close! Follow me! We've gotta get ahead of the ship! Maybe we should go back! They already closed the door behind us. We've come this far! We can make it! Oh! Oh! - Sammy! - Shelly! I can't hold onto the rope! Hold on, I'm coming to get you. - Sammy! - Stay! Stay! Hold on. Just hold on! - (Screams) - Shelly! - Help! - No, no, no! Shelly? Shelly! Shelly, where are you? Shelly? Shelly? Shelly? Oh! Shelly! Shelly. Oh! Ohh! Argh! Oh! Ohh! Ahh! (Gasps) Ohh! Oh, Shelly! 'Losing Shelly was all my fault. 'My big idea to see the world, and now here it was.' Ain't no sunshine when she's gone it's not warm when she's away Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away... Yo, what's up with you? - Nothing. - Is you lost? I suppose I am. ..when she's gone Wonder if she's gone to stay Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away Anytime she goes away Mm-mm-mm-mm And I know, I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know, I know, I know... - Well, hello there, young turtle! - Hi. What's that funny looking mark on your shell? Humans painted it on me. Oh, you poor thing. No, it's not what you think. You're the second turtle we've met with a strange mark on its shell. A shark bite? Yeah, I think that's what she said it was. Yes, I think you're right, dear. Oh, she was a lovely female, too. A bit strange though. Sure was! Told us some crazy story about going through a secret passage, heading for the ice oceans. You sure she said secret passageway? Heard her plain as day! Indeed we did. She was going on and on and on about sweet water, giant ships... That's Shelly! Why, I do believe that was her name. Shelly's alive! She's alive! Oh, thank you, thank you! You just made me the happiest turtle in the whole ocean! Thank you! Good luck, dear. We truly hope you find your mate. Oh, to be young and in love again. 'I searched everywhere. 'I talked to anyone who would listen. 'For a long time, Shelly seemed to have vanished without trace. 'But, once in awhile, I'd come across turtles who'd seen her. 'They gave me hope, fleeting as it was, 'because every time I was close to finding her, 'I'd lose all trace of her again. 'If only she had known I was looking for her. I've been searching Across the lonely water Arms wide open to take you Seems like forever Since we last were laughing Do you remember it the way I do? Just know you never are alone We just need to find our way back home You're not alone We just need to find our way... Hey there, turtle! What's that crazy do-malarkey on your shell there? Helipad or something? It's a human marking. - A peace sign. - Peace sign? Where have I heard that before? Thinking, thinking, och aye, that's what she called it. - Who? - Oh, a cute little greenback like you. Big talker she was. Going on about sweet water, a secret passage, and propellers! You saw Shelly? I sure did! She had to go to the ice ocean. Made no sense to me, but then again what do I know, I'm just a bird, - you're the turtle. - I've gotta get there, fast! Hold on, it's mighty cold there. Please, just tell me how I get there! This current you're on will get you there in no time. - Wouldn't stay there too long, though. - Ow! Frozen stiff ain't too attractive, if you know what I mean. (Laughs) Gotta fly, got a date with a pelican. 'Funny how things had a way of repeating themselves. 'I guess it was all a matter of circumstance and how you looked at it. 'This time around, strangely enough, I was really happy to see a bird.' (Thunderclap) (Thunderclap) (Wind howling) I say, little man, what's that you're riding on? I don't know. The humans threw it away. I think it's some kind of boat. Looks pretty seaworthy. What brings you to these waters? You're a long way from where you should be? I, I know. I'm freezing. Maybe you can help me. I'm looking for... Look out! Oh! Put down your weapons! You cannot do this! You're in violation of the law! The world is watching! - Hey, look at that! It's a green turtle! - Give me a hand. Pull him up here. - You found another one? - Yeah, you believe that? What are they doing in this part of the world? I know the climate's changing, but turtles in Antarctica? That's crazy. Shelly? (Barks) (Barks) (Chattering) (Trims) (Trims) Here you go, my friend. (Man) Her vital signs are good. She's made a remarkable recovery. We'll give her one last check up when we get back to base, then we'll tag her and she's good to go. Yes, I was right, it is you! I've got to get out of here. (Bangs wall) Open! Open! Shelly? Oh. Oh! - Shelly! - (All chatter excitedly) Sammy? (Mimics) Sammy! (All chatter at once) Hey, easy! You're gonna hurt yourself if you fall off there. All right, all right everybody. Shush! Shelly, is that you? Not today. Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Do you know what's going to happen to us? I heard the humans talking about this place. They're gonna take good care of us, put some kind of tag on us, and release us back into the ocean, man. I say, "Relax and enjoy the food. I heard they got good cheese Fritos, man, and that stuff is good. OK? Level Easy. Sacr bleu! Well, look who it is! You are so fat, mon ami. Oh, it's you, Fluffy. But of course it's me! Don't I look just as fantastique as ever? I should be mad at you for tricking me that day on the beach. Oh, yes, ze chicken story. Well, you got me zere. I made it all up. I was a little more insecure back then. You're not going to hold a grudge, are you? No. it's good to see you, Fluffy. You, too, mon frre. So, how did you end up in here? I practically got myself frozen in the ice ocean. Really? So you did it, you went and saw the world after all? Yes. But you do not sound too happy about it. Pourquoi? It's a long story. Oh, mon dieu, speaking of stories, I have to admit I did miss you, whenever Snow started reading her books to me. Snow's here? Mais out! Somewhere. - Shelly! - Shelly? Who is that? Never mind! You have to help me get out of here, now! OK, OK. For being so slow, you turtles are always in a hurry. Fluffy! What do you want me to do? I need you to get the door open. Certain. What are doing in there bothering the animals, again, Fluffy? Oh, I don't believe it. Fluffy, you recognised him? It's our little peace ambassador. Look at you, little man, all grown up. What happened to you? How did you get here? I was afraid you wouldn't make it after I dumped you on the beach. It's so good to see you. I know, I know, you're in a hurry to get back to the sea, aren't you? Well, we're gonna get you out there soon enough. First we have to tag you. I need to get some more from the other building. It's so good to see you, little man, isn't it Fluffy? Back in a jiffy. Fluffy, hurry! All right, stand clear, I will get ze door open! Oy, oy, oy, stop that. Come on, outside, Fluffy, come on, outside and play. Leave the animals be. Sorry, mon ami. OK, here we go. You find yourself a mate, little man. And stay away from the cold water, OK? Bye-bye. 'For a sea turtle, the odds of surviving in the ocean are pretty slim. 'Shelly and I made it through some tough situations, 'with, at times, a little help from the humans. 'But somehow, no matter how hard we tried, 'fate was determined to keep us apart. - You have to help us! - What's wrong? He's trapped! He's gonna fall over! - Who? - Hurry! Follow us! We found someone to help you! Good, cos this thing's about to go! Hold up, hold up, is that all you could find? You might as well have brought me a shrimp. He's too small! What's he gonna do? How's he gonna help me? Stop moving! You'll send yourself over the edge, and you're done for! Wait a second. You sound familiar. Come here. Come on, come closer. Let me get a better look at you. Well, twist my shell cos I can't believe this! Sammy? Sammy, is that you? Ray? I thought you were... Go ahead, go on say it- turtle soup, huh? (Laughs) How did you ever get away? Ah, it takes a lot more to stop old Ray here. You know that. It took me two days. This kid, a first-timer on the boat, found me, tossed me in a bait bucket. - Hoo. - Good thing, too, cos I was starving! After I ate all the bait, I jumped overboard. By then we were miles away from each other. I blamed myself for us getting separated. No, Ray, you... Whoa! He's gonna fall over if you don't get him out of there! I can do this. How did you end up in this thing anyway? OK, let me tell you about it, right? It was full of frozen squid when I found it! It was gonna be an easy in and out, but it slipped and I got trapped, so I just started eating them one by one, cos they thawed out real slow. But as I was eating, I started getting full, then I started moving slow, then I couldn't move and you know me I got the trots. OK, OK, no more talking, it's time to get you outta there! (Grunts) No, no, no! Easy, Sammy. Don't move, Ray, stay still. No! Ray! Sammy, can you get me out of here? Get me out of here! - Ahh! - Oh! Ahh! (Grunts) Whoo! I knew you had my shell all the time, my friend. Whoo! Ladies, my heartfelt gratitude goes out to you. Your bravery is only exceeded by your collective beauty. (Both giggle) Good line, Ray. Isn't it? Aside from the obvious reason, it's really good to see you, Sammy. It's been a long time. So what are you doing out here all alone? It's a long story. - Now where have I heard that before? - I need your help, Ray. Hey, we're practically brothers. What do you need? I have to find someone. Someone very special to me. The trick is to know where to look. And this time of year, there's only one place she would be headed. That would be the magical place. Look at this. It shines like this all day. You never want to leave. This is amazing! If you're looking for a mate, this is where you wanna be. There's Rita! Hey, Honeybee! - Rita, I'm back! - Huh? What? (Gasps) Ray! What took you so long? Oh, shnookums, I was... entangled, so to speak, OK? And then I swam into my very old friend. Honey, sugar pie, this is Sammy. (Gasps) Sammy? For real? The one and only. Hi, Rita. Very pleased to meet you. I thought you was dead? I mean, Ray always thought... I know, turtle soup. I'm glad you finally tamed his wandering ways. (Both) He's cute. Hey, hey, hey, relax, girls, he's got a mate already. Well, where is she? I'd love to meet her. - I wish I knew. - That's why we're here. See, we need to find her. They were separated quite a while ago. Oh, you poor dear. They've been looking for each other ever since. (Both) Oh, how romantic. She's got a shark bite on her shell. - Anybody seen her? - I believe I did. What's her name? - Shelly. - Yes, that's her! Where did you see her? Where did she go? I'm pretty sure she went in there. What are you waiting for, buddy? Let's go find her. - Oh, no, you don't. - Oh, but sugar bee... You stay right here. Sammy needs me. You brought him here, now it's up to him. Oh, OK then. I'll be right here if you want me. (Both) You'll find her, Sammy. Love always finds a way. Yeah. Always finds a way I know you're somewhere out there - Somewhere far away - Shelly? - I want you back - Shelly? I want you back - My neighbours think I'm crazy - Shelly? But they don't understand You're all I have At night when the stars light up my room I sit by myself Talking to the moon Trying to get to you In hopes you're on the other side Talking to me too Or am I a fool Who sits alone Talking to the moon? Oh-oh-oh I'm feeling like I'm famous The talk of the town They say I've gone mad Yeah, I've gone mad But they don't know what I know Cos when the sun goes down... Shelly? Shelly? Oh! (Grunts) Shelly? Oh! What's wrong? You didn't find her? She's here all right. She's got a mate. Are you sure? I'm positive. I saw them together behind the boat. Oh, no. I'm really sorry, Sammy. What are you gonna do now? I know, I know you're probably not thinking this way, but there are lots of other turtles out there. Stop it, Ray. That's not what he wants to hear right now. Hey, Ray, you's back, how's it going? - Could be better. - Ooh, hi, Rita. Robbie, Clara's been looking for you. Well, that figures. With all the good-looking gals out here, she does not want me to be wandering around too much. - (Both giggle) - Well, I better get going. And later. You too, manana banana, you know what I'm talkin' about. - Who's Clara? - Robbie's mate. I thought... Shelly and... Robbie were... Mates? (Laughs hysterically) Yes, that's the way it looked to me. Robbie? Oh, oh, he'll flirt with any gal that says hello, and that's why Clara keeps him on a tight leash. That... would be Robbie. I should do the same with you. Me on a leash? Oh, sugar, you know you're my baby bee. So that means... Shelly may not have a mate after all. You might be right. What do I do? I wouldn't be waiting around here. But what if she doesn't... Doesn't what? Duh! Want him as her mate. Oh, yeah, OK, hold on, hold on. I got it! I got an idea. All right, listen to me, this is what you're gonna have to do, You're gonna need to make a big entrance, Sammy. Is Albert still hanging around? He is. What crazy idea are you trying to pull off this time? Trust me, eh! Ohh! (Screams) Help! Oh! Oh, thank you. You were so brave. I suppose I was finally in the right place at the right time. Sammy? How did you find me? Look out! Behind you! It's OK... he's a friend. What? What, what's going on? I knew this was a bad idea Oh, I see. After what happened at the secret passage, I wasn't sure if... If what? If you and I were meant to be. Come here, silly. Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do J Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-bi-do! Yeah! I - Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do - (Both) Whoo! Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh I was born, by a mother at the school of understanding And raised, by a sister, who taught me I could be standing At the age of seven, I fell in love with Blackie And nothing could come in my way When women go smiling I start running When women go talking I start blushing When women start asking - Why I keep on falling - Keep on falling I can't stop running away They call me little love child with a thorn in my side You shouldn't be talking to me They call me little love child with a thorn in my side You shouldn't be talking to me Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh I soon turned eleven I was lost and separated It was head over heels that got me stimulated Like John McEnroe, my sky kept on falling I knew I had something to say... Look, I'm getting all blubbery and soft-shelled. Oh, you poor dear. Next thing you know I'm gonna put a little pink pom-pom on my tail. Oh, I'm so sensitive. Asking, asking, we're falling, we're falling... 'The day I was born, the odds were I wasn't going to make it, 'and I didn't have a clue as to what I was supposed to do. 'Ray showed me how to have fun and the meaning of true friendship, 'and then I met Shelly. 'She made me complete, gave my life meaning, 'and that, by any measure, is pretty great. 'As for humans, 'I must admit, we're going to need their help more and more, 'to protect us and keep our oceans alive and beautiful.' Looks like the little ones made it out pretty good this time. Well, looks that way. So, where did we say we're supposed to meet the women again? Tristan da Cunha. Tristan da what? It's in the middle of nowhere. - Any humans? - What can I say? You know they're everywhere! Hello? - I've got this one. - Go for it. Hello, hello, is anybody up there? Hi, there. Uh, hi, I can't get out. Could you help me? I know exactly how you feel. Let me give you a little nudge to get you started. The first steps are always the hardest. What exactly am I supposed to do? Just put one flipper in front of the other and you'll be all right. 00-oo-oo 00-oo-oo Sometimes I get my head in a dilly Feeling so lost, ticking you off Now, boy, you know me well Said, I'm that kinda filly That kind of soft, that kind of silly But when I'm in doubt, I open my mouth And words come out, words come out like Baby, there's a shark in the water, water There's something underneath my bed Oh, please believe I said Baby, there's a shark in the water, water I caught them barking at the moon Better be soon High in the sky, the song that I'm singing A sweet little lie, I cry wolf, cry Rabbit out the hat Yes, that's what I'm bringing Got some tricks up my sleeve For noticing me Oh, yeah I wouldn't cause you any harm, I just want you in my arms I can't help, I can't help myself Baby, there's a shark in the water There's something underneath my bed Oh, please believe I said Baby, there's a shark in the water, water I caught them barking at the moon Better be soon Better be soon Right is right Rules are rules This is more like April fool I'm just winding you up I
