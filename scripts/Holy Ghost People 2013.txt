Who the fuck are you? You left your wallet and keys at the bar I work at. You know, after you got your ass kicked. Catch. Get the fuck out. Ah, not a morning person? No. How about I get dressed first? If you're gonna tell a story, it's best to tell it straight and true. But what if the truth ain't straight? This here's the story of two sisters torn apart. The question is: By what? Fate? God? Me? Maybe. I found him last night outside the bar I work at. Out here all alone It's time for thinkin' And dreamin' about being gone I call this song my own I sing it for myself Just a song before I go And I remember How many times we got to keep doing this, Wayne? Always trying to make me look bad in front of my people. Hey! - Get off him! - Step off, bitch! Hey, man, you all right? Want me to call the cops? Tell me what you want me to do. Learn how to mind your own fucking business. Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah-ah, oh Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah-ah, oh The story really starts when I was 15... and my mama got cancer. One day we're all sittin' around her hospital bed... while they drained her blood out like a bunch of mosquitoes. Next it's just me and my sister... figuring out the world for ourselves. Once upon a time, we could hide our pain by slipping into a costume. Liz, a princess, and me, Wonder Girl. But after Mama died, things got complicated. I could get high a dozen times and stop whenever I wanted, but for Liz, it wasn't like that. There's people you miss when they're gone. Then there's the people that's so tangled up with you... that losing them means cutting off a piece of your own flesh right along with them. You cut off that much of yourself, it's bound to leave some scars. Get in. Thanks... for bringing my shit back. Not much I can really do with six bucks and a military I.D. See you around. I'm Charlotte, by the way. Come on, Shirley. Ah, Jesus. Hey! I need a favor. Hey! I need to borrow your car. No. But, uh, that's what friends do. They borrow things. Oh, you have a friend now, huh? - When did that happen? - When I needed a car. Get out. Well, how about a ride? Look, um, my mom's not doing so good. I need to go get my sister, bring her home. I'll pay you. $200. Everything I got. Let's go. Where we going? Up Sugar Mountain. After this, you can stop coming around, okay? Yeah. Runnin' from the devil 'Cause running's all I know Ran so far, I got lost And so I ran some more Jesus rides ahead of me But the devil's gainin' ground So I'm runnin' Yes, I'm runnin' When you're alone in this world, you learn to find help anywhere, any way you can, including bending the truth about your own dead mama. Yes, I'm runnin' The trick is to find someone who might just be worse off than you are. They're the ones who've got nothing to lose. I haven't seen or heard from Liz in over a year. Then a letter came in the mail. She wrote that she missed me, that she was sober and living at a church up on Sugar Mountain. Needed me to come get her right away. Why? She didn't say. Just that she was scared and needed to come home. What is this place? A church, I think. Goddamn it. Let it shine This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine I'm gonna let it shine, let it shine, let it shine Thank you. All right. All right. - Welcome. - Welcome! Yeah! - This Bible don't lie. - No, it don't! No! It don't do nothin' but tell God's plain truth... every word. Every word. You don't get to pick and choose, now, honey, do ya? This ain't no ice cream parlor. What do you like, Smiling Bobby? Vanilla? No! How about bubblegum? It ain't like that, is it? No, sir. - No, it ain't! - He knows it, Brother Bill. You're either all in... or you're out. - That's right! - You're out! You are out into that lake of fire to burn for eternity. But it don't have to be that way. Do it, Brother Sherman? No, sir. No, it don't. And why is that? Why is that? That's because Jesus sent us the Holy Ghost. But there's only one way to receive that spirit, isn't there? We got to be in one accord. - Are we in one accord? - Yes! Amen! Bless your name, holy Jesus. Satan's sheddin' big ol' tears tonight. Yeah! He's a big boy, ain't he? I call him Satan, 'cause he's so big and mean. It's these deadly serpents the Lord sent us to handle... without fear. Our hearts are filled with the Holy Ghost. Mmm. Get on up here, Brother Cole. Satan wants to talk to you. Hey! Where is she? I don't know. I'll be in the car. You hear stories trickling down the mountain... of people up here following their own sort of laws. Old laws. You know? The kind where blood gets shed when they're broke. Cops don't even come up here, let alone a city girl poking around, asking questions. How you doing? How can we help you? Well, I was wondering... Mm-hmm? I was wondering if I could join your church. And what about your gentleman friend? He wanna join too? Oh, uh, that's my daddy. Oh, well, your daddy don't seem too interested. He has problems with his nerves. Socially. Hmm. We're not so easy to find. I know. But, uh, people talk, you know. No, I don't. Excuse me. Wait. My dad, um... He has a problem with the bottle, you see. And... I've tried everything, short of kicking his butt out of the house. And, uh... I'm sorry. You're all right. You're fine. Now, what's your name? Rachel. All right, Rachel, I'm Billy. Now, listen. This mountain, it gets awfully dark at night, easy to lose track of where you're at. This ain't territory you wanna get lost in. I can't just let you up and join. But... But what I can do is offer you a bed for the evening, and tomorrow you and your daddy can take a look around, see if what people's been saying is the truth. Plenty of folks out there speaking with forked tongues these days, if you know what I mean. Your dad? I'll pay you another $200. When we get back. Take care of yourself, kid. Right this way. Where's your father? He forgot something in the car. - Hey. - You must be Rachel's father. Wayne. I'm Sister Sheila. Y'all need anything else, don't hesitate to ask. We'll be fine. Good night. Good night. How'd your sister get caught up in all this shit? I... I don't know. You know what you're getting yourself into? Just give me the day. I always hated going to church. Shit. Charlotte, let me in. Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte, it's me! Charlotte, it's me! Just open the door! Charlotte. Charlotte, you want me to die? We let Jesus and his beliefs guide us, not only in our hearts but also in our hands. Up here, we live, breathe and sleep the Word, submit ourselves to it. We have addicts and former convicts... forgotten souls that other churches would have turned away. But we're all family in God's eyes. Hello. That's Smiling Bobby. Brother Billy gave him his name. Said God stuck a smile on him and called it a day. Brother Edgar, your commitment to Jesus Christ starts today. Your baptism truly is... your new beginning. An obedience to the wonderful, almighty, powerful word of God. And in commandment with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, we baptize this brother... in the name of Lord Jesus. Sweet Jesus! How do you do it, Jesus? How do you give us this strength? Whoo! Hallelujah, brother. Hey. You gonna stay the day, you got to work the day. That's the rule. I got Jesus on my mind When you see me comin', I got Jesus on my mind I got Jesus, Jesus on my mind When you see me prayin', I got Jesus on my mind When you see me prayin', I got Jesus on my mind When you see me prayin', I got Jesus on my mind Need some help? Sure. Can I ask you something? Can you leave? You know, if you decide this isn't right for you. Honey, this ain't no prison. You know if someone called Liz O'Neil ever lived here? Mm, not that I know of. Are you sure? 'Cause she told me that she did. Hey. Ain't you supposed to be cleaning the showers? I finished with that, so I thought I'd... You thought you'd what? I'm sorry, Brother Sherman. I'll... I'll go see if Sister Nancy needs extra help. Good. How you doing... with all this? I'm all right. It must be quite a shock. City girl like yourself. I'm doing just fine. Come on, son. Back and the front. The back and the front. Come on now. Wash 'em. Marine Corps, huh? Iraq? Afghanistan. Three tours. Look at this. Look at this. United States Army. First Battalion, 101st Airborne. Vietnam. Hooah. Hooah. Come on now. Do the work. Do the work. Come on now. "There is no fear in love." How true. Excuse me, Rachel. Come on. You're fine. Let me out. All right. Come on. Come on, girl. Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. When you handle a deadly serpent, all your pain, all your fears just... disappear. It's just you, the serpent and the Holy Ghost. Only one way to conquer your enemy. That's to love him. You comin'? Yeah. Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Yes, sir. I am hot for God tonight. Yes, sir, Brother Billy! If you ain't hot for God, honey, then just get as cold as you can get. We'll know what side of the fence you're on. If the gospel's good enough to live by, then it's good enough to die by. And I'm ready. I'm willin', Lord. Oh. I ain't afraid to be judged for the deeds I've done. Are you? Praise. How about a song? Well, he didn't have to do it, but he did He didn't have to love me, but he did Brought me up, put me on my way Woke me up and I'm here to stay He didn't have to do it, but he did I love my wife. With all my heart. She's obedient, kind. I am truly blessed. But... I have a demon inside of me. It's invaded my mind... with thoughts of other women. Sexual thoughts. I-I-I've prayed on it. Alone. And with my wife. But it's no good. God... Je... Holy Ghost, come in me. That's enough. That's enough. God bless you, Brother Sherman. God bless this church. What the hell did you do? - Get your shit and let's go. - You backin' out on me? You lookin' for something that ain't here. Yeah, well, you're just looking for a fucking drink. Fuckin'... Go get your drink, Wayne. Get the fuck out... Fuck it. You're a Southern boy, aren't ya? Let me guess. Louisiana. - New Orleans. - New Orleans. Whoo! Devil sure runs wild down there, don't he? Think I even ran with him a time or two. You don't seem surprised. I think I got you pretty well figured out. You do, huh? Yeah. Hide up here, feed these people bullshit. You think that, huh? Just one big power play, and you get off on it. Oh. Well, maybe you're right. Sometimes I forget what this must look like from the outside. You know that Neil Young song "Sugar Mountain"? What? You know that song? - Yeah. - I like Neil Young. Used to. And that song's all about being young forever. Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain With the... I can't remember all the words. But I do remember... You can't be 20 On Sugar Mountain Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon Leaving there too soon I was 19 when my daddy died. It was a jet black, son of a bitch timber. Got him real good on the arm. He was dead in 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes. I was right there with him, holding his hand when his heart stopped cold. He'd have killed me if he knew I was listening to Neil Young. Drinking beer. Lots of beer. Sleeping with women. Lots of women. We're not that different, Brother Wayne. I know it might feel that way. Yeah. Anyway, I just wanted to come down here and apologize... for forcing that snake on you. That was bullshit, and I'm sorry. You take care of yourself. Hey. You really believe in all of this? On my daddy's grave. Shh. Shh, shh. Hey. Shh. Shh. We'll leave in the morning. I thought I smelled smoke. Sorry. It's not allowed or something? May I? Sure. Can't smoke cigarettes, drink, wear makeup, any of that. A pretty girl like you shouldn't hide behind your lipstick anyway. Ah, it's fine. Finish it up. Now, I'm gonna help your daddy heal, and then I'm gonna help you. Oh, yeah? Good girl. Now, you entered God's country, and he brought you up here for a reason. When you figure it out, give me a holler. Liz O'Neil. Know where she is? - Who's that? - A friend. Part of this church. She's the one that told me to come here. Huh. Sorry. I never heard of your friend. Wrong church maybe. Church of One Accord? You're at it. Liz? Many burdens that we have to bear Brother Bill, you in? But there's a prayer bell at the Lord's right hand Give it a ring and he will understand Thank you, God. Prayer bells on heaven Oh, how sweetly they ring They're ringing today, Father. Sendin' a message unto Jesus, our king Thank you, Jesus. Another precious day. I know you don't believe in what we're doing up here. You don't know anything about me. I know more than you think. My world wasn't always this place. Take your daughter and go. You don't belong here. Where'd you get this? Billy's cabin. Hey. Go to the cabin now! Billy? A word. Sure thing. Brothers. Appreciate it. What's goin' on? How do you have this? Why did you lie? About what? - Why do you have this? - Don't fuck with me, man. You said you didn't know Liz O'Neil, but you have a picture of her. Brother Wayne, this is Lyla, my wife. I know this woman as Lyla Rose. Where is she? Why do you care? Because I do. She fell hard, brother. Right on down the mountain. - You mean she left? - I mean I kicked her drug-using ass out. Broke my heart to do it. Women. Why God made 'em such slippery creatures I'll never know. Where'd she go? Who knows? Her mama's dead, and never really had a daddy. Her mama ain't dead. Sure, she is. Been dead for years. All she got left is her sister, Charlotte. Or should I say Rachel? Why don't you go ask your daughter what happened to her sister? Watch that forked tongue slide right out of her fuckin' mouth. Excuse me. Is your mom dead? What? How do you know that? What did he say? Wayne, what did Billy say? Wayne, what did Billy say? Look, I know that I lied, but... I was desperate, okay? I fucked up. What'd he say about Liz? You know you can't trust them. Wayne! The Lord knows what we're doing up on this mountain. - He knows! - Yeah, he does. He knows we ain't lookin' to die. - We're lookin' to live! - Yeah! Stop it! We're lookin' for redemption... in his name. Brother Cole, get on up here so we can pray on you. We know you have the power, Lord Jesus. We know you have the power. We ask you to heal this man. Cure him of his cancer. We ask you to purify his body... and strengthen his heart... for the battle to come! Butch, bring it on. Come on. - And I'm on my way to heaven - Come on! We got you, brother. We got you, Brother Cole. Praise the Lord! Hey! What do you know? Come back! Come back! Ow! Oh, my God! Save him, Jesus. Save him! What are you doing out here, Charlotte? How do you know my name? Lyla... she talked about you all the time. Lyla? Your sister. Brother Wayne pulled out that photo, and it was like a shroud had been lifted from my eyes, and I could see you. Is she here? Go on. - Where is she? - She's gone. Back in the gutter where I found her. You comin' here was never about your sister, Charlotte. It was always about you. Your sins. And your need to be forgiven for what you did. On your knees. You got a demon inside you, Charlotte. Just like your sister. Except your demon's name is guilt, and we gotta get it out. We talked for hours, your sister and I. Right in this very room. She told me everything. And it was all your fault. And you wanted her to fall. No. No. 'Cause you were jealous... of who she was and who you weren't. No. - Say it, Charlotte. Say it. - No. Say what you did. No. No. Are you sure? - I'm sorry. - I know. I'm sorry. I know. Where's Wayne? He left. I'm gonna take care of you now, honey. We all are. Okay, here we go. It's okay. Shh. Char... Charlotte? Shh. Shh. It's just me. Charlotte. Holy Ghost in a vial. I survived him. I survived Billy. But Lyla Rose... I told you you should leave. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. How long you think till he, uh, you know... Uh, not long now. What are you doing here, sister? Brother Billy asked me to come check on him, and, of course, I said yes. You are a real good woman, Sheila. You're gonna make a husband really happy someday. If God allows. Forgive me, Lord, for all that I have done. Forgive me. I beg... your safe love, Jesus. It's time to get up, sweetie. Come on. Would the Lord smile upon me... if I was to end your suffering? Okay. Take a deep breath. Today we are gathered together in the sight of God... to witness this holy binding. This man and this woman. Let us pray. Precious God, we pray your blessings... will be released on this couple and on this union. Marriage holds this church together. It strengthens our bond, feeds our souls. We live and die by one accord. By accepting Billy as her husband, Rachel joins this accord. She is now one of us. Till death do her part. - Amen. - Amen. Please take Rachel's right hand. Brother Billy, do you desire to be united in marriage to Rachel, to love her as Christ commands... so long as you both shall live? I do. Rachel, do you desire to be united in marriage to Brother Billy, to love and serve him as Christ commands, so long as you shall live? I do. You may kiss your bride. Praise God. Praise Jesus! Hello? Hi. Hi yourself. Your sister, on her wedding day... never saw anything so beautiful. Till today. Sit up. It's through suffering... we find our true selves. I'm sorry you're in such pain. What? Take me to her. Now. All right, girl. All right. A last fire will rise Behind those eyes Black house will rock Blind boys don't lie Immortal fear That voice so clear Through broken walls That scream I hear Cry, little sister Charlotte! Come to your brother Thou shalt not die Unchain me, sister Thou shalt not fear Love is with your brother Thou shalt not kill We're here. This woman, Rachel, came to us as a Christian, ready to join our family. Along with her father, Wayne. But this is not the truth. This woman's name is Charlotte, and she is no Christian. Wayne is no blood relation of hers. She lied to us. She lied to herself. She lied to God. She entered into holy union with Billy. Why? To spread distrust. To do the devil's bidding. To sever our accord. For this, she must be punished. Please. Will anyone raise a voice in her defense? Let us pray for her soul. Someone, please help me. I'm sorry. Stop! Stop! Billy, please! Someone help. Proceed. No, please. Billy, please! Please! Go on. There is no fear here. Only love. Billy, please! Stop! Drop it, Sherman. I said drop it! Everyone get down on their stomachs. Now! Do what he says. Not you, Sheila. Get on the ground, Billy. Wayne, don't do this, brother. Sheila, I need you to go untie Charlotte. - Please. - Don't. We're your family. Wayne, give me the gun. Sheila, please. I'm sorry. Look out! Bobby, get down! No more, Jesus Christ! Please make it stop! Please make it... I got you. I got you. Easy. Okay. Okay, honey. You gotta let go. Okay. There you go. Get her to a hospital. I will. Fear God... and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment has come. Brother Wayne. Admit it. You're just a babe lost in the woods. What do you believe in, Wayne? Your country? How'd that turn out? What you've done is wrong. Your words can't change that. I have a feeling we'll meet again, brother. Like two serpents intertwined. Would you be free From the burden of sin? There's power in the blood Power in the blood What are you doing? I'd like to have known you back in New Orleans. We'd have ripped up that town, you and me. Couple of hound dogs on a hunt. Hey! Back out of the fuckin' water! What are you gonna do, shoot me? I did my time, boy, Louisiana State Penitentiary, and I ain't goin' back. Would you o'er evil a victory win? There is wonderful power in the blood Yes, sirree. I'll be seeing you again, brother. Hopefully in heaven, but can't be too sure. I imagine where we're headed might look something like this lake. Except it'll be on fire, of course, and millions of people screamin'. See you later, Wayne. Power, power Wonder-working power In the blood of the lamb Power, power Wonder-working power In the precious blood of the lamb How many times did we dream of runnin' out of that house? You'd be a princess. I'd be Wonder Girl, sworn to protect you from harm. Take my hand. One, two, three... Run! Get outta here, or I'm gonna call the cops! Oh, call 'em! Would you be free from the burden of sin? There's a power in the blood Power in the blood Would you o'er evil A victory win? There's a power in the blood Power in the blood Would you do service For your Jesus, your king?
