I'm behind bills... - I know, I was... I'm counting on it too, okay? I'll figure something out, I will. I promise you, I will. Come on. - Don't be like that. - Don't... Don't "come on" me. Stop it. Stop it. - Go to basketball tryouts today? - No. Why not? Because I don't wanna play basketball. I wanna play football. He's gonna get hurt if he plays football. - Tell him he needs to play basketball. - You need to play basketball. Wow, that's just the enthusiasm he needs. - What do you want me to say? - I want you to encourage him. I would, but he can't shoot hoops. - Why not? Why not? When he dribbles, he looks like a retard. - I can dribble. No, you can't. - I can. - No, you can't. - Yes, I can. - I've seen you dribble. You can't dribble. Your sister dribbles better than you. - Can I box? - Can you box? - What are you gonna box, oranges? No boxing. - Out of your head. - Why not? Because I say so. Don't look at me. If you throw a punch the way you dribble, you're not even gonna see 13. I can't be worse than you. - Hey, what'd you say? - Nothing. You said something. I wanna hear it. - I didn't say anything. What'd you say? I didn't say anything. - So? - What? What now? Jesus Christ. - You check the fuse box? It's not the fuse box. We're the only ones out. Did you pay Con Ed? You wanna do this in front of the kids right now? Can you turn on the lights? I'm scared. Oh, sweetie, don't be scared. Come here, come here, come here. There's nothing to be scared of.

Don't throw that at me. You're playing this game no matter what. - That's right, that's right. I ain't playing this game. - Yes, you are. - Come on, concentrate, woman, focus. Don't throw that at me. - Open up, Mom. Come on, it loves you. Wait, wait, baby, let me do it, let me do it. Let me get it, Mama. Watch, watch. Come on, open your mouth. She's right. Come on. That's right. You know how we like it. Oh! Ah. You spit it out. I got it in. I wanna demand a recount. Justin. Aw. All right, that's enough. No more. Come on. We're not gonna waste all the food. That was fun. - You're not scared anymore, right? No, I'm not. - What was that? Not anymore. CHILDREN Trick or treat! All right, I'm coming, I'm coming. Hey, can I help you? Yeah, New York City Department of Housing. Trick or treat. - What's going on? What is this? Sorry, man. You got two hours to pack your stuff. Come on. All right, how much do we have? Two hundred and twenty-nine. Two hundred and twenty-nine, okay. If I sell the car, we could probably get what, another 800, maybe 900, if we're lucky. - I'll look for a job tomorrow. - You can't look for a job. Who's gonna take care of Tina? Come on, we can't afford it. - Where are we gonna go tonight? - I don't know, I don't know. Why don't we just go to a hotel, sleep the night, try to figure things out? Why don't we call your cousin Benny? No way. We're not staying with Benny. There's no way I'm staying with him. He's been shot, like, five times. He's a goddamn hoodlum. I can call Luis. What are you thinking? I wasn't thinking. I mean... Hey, I'm sorry. Look, I'm fine. Just forget it. Just forget it, all right? Check, please. Check. Everything okay here? - Yeah, it's great. - What's the damage? - Uh, it's 16 pumpkins. Sixteen, that's a lot of pumpkins. - How much are the shakes? Five dollars apiece. - And the fries? Three ninety-five. Okay, so five and five and four is what, 14? Well, there's tax too. Right, right, tax. Who can forget the government, right? Excuse me. I'll give you a minute. Can I get some money, please? What's the matter? Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong? What, what, what? What's the matter? Come on. Look, this isn't easy on either one of us, all right, but we gotta be strong. Gotta be strong, baby. We've gotta make a pact, no crying in front of the kids. You got me? - I'm just tired. - I know, I know. But the best thing for us right now is to stay together, you got it? Yeah. We're gonna make it. I promise you, we're gonna make it. - Okay. - All right? Yeah. I love you. Now come on. Let's pay the bill and go to sleep, all right? I'll take care of it. Take the kids out. - I need a moment, okay? - All right. Come on. Come on, hurry up. Put all the candy away. I got it. I'm not done watching. You pick them up. Why do I gotta go pick it up? Why can't you? Don't start. - But we... - I got enough things on my mind. - What the hell you doing? I'm sorry. - I'm really sorry. - Clean it up. Help him. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. - Don't you usually give me 75? - What about those bricks you dropped? - You expect me to pay for that? - Come on. I broke 10 bricks. How much are bricks, You want the 50 or not? Come on, man. All I'm saying is that 10 bricks at 50 cents is how much? I mean, do the math. You know what? I don't got time for this shit. Take the 75. Just don't ever expect me to hire you again. It's your choice. Keep it. There's a smart man if I ever saw one. Hey, have you got any work coming up in the next few days? I don't know if you noticed all the decorations all over the place, but it's Christmas. Thanks a lot. - Ha. - You scared me, you idiot. So, what you doing? Just trying to bring some Christmas spirit to this place. Oh, yeah, it's really working. Look at that. - How was work? - I made 50 bucks. - You usually make 75. - Yeah, usually. Look, I don't wanna talk about it, all right? Okay. Where are the kids? Justin's outside playing with some friends and Christina's on the bed playing with some toys the Salvation Army dropped off. Hey, Tina. - Who's your friend? Smiddy. Hi. Get the hell out of here. Angie. Angie. I can't find my jacket. What? I think somebody stole my jacket. Can you believe that? Jesus. Hey, excuse me, can I talk to you for a second? Someone stole my jacket last night. I need to file a report. Actually, Mr. Diaz, I was just about to come and find you. Uh, follow me. I need to talk to you. Did you find it? You're not gonna believe this. You're not gonna believe it. What? What's wrong? We gotta leave the shelter. What? Remember that list I put us on for the apartments a couple months ago? - Yeah. - Yeah, well, they called us. - You're kidding me. - Yeah. We're gonna be in our own apartment for Christmas after all. What do you think of that? I'm not kidding. I gotta see the property manager in an hour. - Oh, my God. - Didn't I tell you? - Didn't I promise you? - You did, you did. - I promised you, right? - Is Santa Claus gonna come this year? There is no Santa Claus. Really, stupid, think about it. How can Santa Claus go to everyone's house in the whole wide world in one night? Don't listen to your brother. He doesn't know his ass from his mouth. Sweetie, you know what? Santa already came. - He brought us a beautiful apartment. - But I want my doll back. Aw. - Well... You know what Papa's gonna do? I'm gonna call Santa personally and make sure that he hooks you up with whatever it is you want. Let me get a little giggle out of you. - Nothing? - She's tired. All right. I gotta go, honey. Come on. Why don't you take the troublemaker with you, and I'll take Tina to the clinic and pack everything up? You get the easy way out, huh? - You know he can't stay here. - I get stuck with him. - Come on, Justin. - Why can't I stay here? Because you're coming with me, that's why. Come on, bundle up, champ. - Bundle up. - You can't go out like that. Come on, baby. I'm five blocks from the subway, then a couple of blocks... Just take that. - See you back here in a couple of hours? - With a key. With the key to our new apartment. Thank God. Oh, it's freezing. - Come on, let's go. - Why can't I stay here? Because you can't, that's why. It's not safe. - I can protect myself. - Oh, yeah? You can protect yourself from a grown man? Yeah, hell, yeah. Yeah, let someone try something. - Where the hell you get that? - I got it from a friend. Can I see it? What the hell are you doing with this, man? What's wrong with you? - What? - Carrying shit like that. - What's wrong with you? - I can protect myself. - You can protect yourself from a man? - Yeah. - You think you could? - Yeah. Come on, protect yourself. What you gonna do now? What you gonna do now? Come on, what you gonna do? Protect yourself. If you can do it, man, if you can protect from me, you can stay here all day. Come on. - Ugh. - Uh-huh. Just as I thought. You're an asshole. Don't ever let me catch you with a knife again, you hear me? Whatever. - Go under, go under. - What? Go under. Go, go! Hi. Merry Christmas. I'm Frank Diaz. I'm here to see Carita about an apartment. Oh, Jesus. Oh, look. Hey, hey, look. Yankee Stadium, man. - We can watch the game from here. - Oh. - That's cool. Okay, Mr. Diaz, it's $201 a month. And utilities included, first and last month's security. There's three bedrooms down the hall. This is it. What do you think? Well, it's not exactly where God left his shoes, but it'll do. You can actually move in today. That's great, that'd be great. If you're handy, you can, mm, fix it up, do something with it. Yeah, I know. Put a little muscle to it, maybe paint it, you know? - Yeah. - Change the floors a bit. - I could do something with that. - Yeah, well, wonderful, wonderful. Um, why don't we go back to my office, and we can get the paperwork filled out? It's Christmas Eve. I know you'd like to be in. - I would love that. You saw that, man? I know. - How great is that? Awesome. Here you go. Fill this out. - What is this? The application. You need a pen? Sir, you need a pen? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, thank you. Okay. You all right? Yeah. You know what, do you mind if I filled it out right outside? - Be just a second. All right. Thank you. Come with me. Here, fill that out. - Why? - Just fill it out. Why can't you do it? Because my wrist is killing me from the last fight, that's why. It is. My wrist is killing me. Just fill it out, all right? Then anything you don't understand, just ask me, all right? Here's your application, and here's the $400. Well, actually, it's $398, but I'll get you the 2 bucks in about two days, all right? Okay, that's fine. You didn't fill out the employment section. Right, because, uh, I'm in between jobs right now. I'm a boxer. One of the requirements in qualifying for an apartment here is that you have some form of income. No, I do, I do. I just work off the books, that's all. So it's, like, construction and, you know, work hasn't been steady lately... Unfortunately, I can't put down that you work off the books. Right. I'm gonna have a few jobs lined up right after Christmas. That won't work. Management is very strict, and since you don't have a guaranteed form of income, I can't process your application. I will have to put you back on the list. What are you talking about? I can't give you the apartment unless you are presently employed, on the books. Your name will go on the list. When an apartment becomes available, I'll contact you. My family's in a shelter, and I can't do it anymore. We just can't do it anymore. Do you understand? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what else to tell you. You can tell me the apartment is ours, and we can move in there today. I can't do that. Come on, it's Christmas. It's Christmas. Give me a break. Can you cut me a break, please? I promise you, I'll have a job by the first of the year. I guarantee. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. I have a family too, and if I put you down for the apartment and get caught, I can lose my job. Justin, wait for me outside. - Give her hell. - Yeah. Let me explain something to you. Let me explain my situation to you, maybe. Maybe you'll understand, um. Me and my family, we've been having some hard months, and all we want is to have an apartment for Christmas, that's all. That's all we want. Look, I understand your position. I know what you're in, but imagine having children and sleeping in a dirty shelter on a cold floor for three months. Imagine that. I understand, I understand... - No, but are you imagining that for me? Yes, I understand your position. Many of the tenants who live here were in your shoes at one time or another, but like I said, there's nothing I can do. Right. Nothing you can do. You know, let me ask you something. How many of those tenants that were in my shoes went into the Gulf War and fought for this country? - How many of them, huh? - Excuse me? It's a simple question. How many of them went and fought? I went and joined up and fought for this country when I was 18 years old, okay? And you're telling me that it's okay for me to risk my life, risk my life for your family, but you don't have to put anything on the line - for me and my family. - It's not like that. Yeah. Yeah, it is like that. It's just like that. Wait, wait, uh. Come back, please. Do you get a check from the government each month? I don't get anything. I don't get a dime. I don't get nothing. Look, I leave the office at 6 tonight. If you can find a job by then, the apartment's yours. That's the best I can do. Otherwise, and I'm sorry, but I'll have to call the next person on the list. - Thank you. I know what you're doing. - Here. - Thank you so much. - Mm-hm. So, what happened in there? So we didn't get it? No, we didn't get it, Einstein. Not yet, anyway. - Where we going now? - To get a job. Why? Why? Because I need a job to get an apartment, that's why. Why didn't you tell her you already have a job, make something up? - And when she finds out I lied? - We'll already have the keys. We'll get thrown out of another apartment. Great. No. But why can't you just...? No, you could... - Actually, you could just tell her... - Guy, you're not making sense. - Shut up. - Don't tell me to shut up. You shut up. I'm just trying to help. - Know how you can help? - How? By shutting up. MAN Stand clear of the closing door. Oh, man. I'm hungry. Well, you should have ate at the shelter. Can we eat when we get off the train? No, no, no, all the money I got is for the apartment. Should have went with Mom. Yeah, you should have. Who lives here? Just mind your business and don't embarrass me, all right? - How you doing? - What are you doing here? - I told you I got no work today. - I know, I know, and I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to talk to your father. - About what? - It's about... Hello, Mr. Montecello, how are you? - How you doing? - I'm sorry to bother you. I know it's Christmas Eve and whatnot, but I got something very important to talk to you about, if you got a minute. We're a little busy right now. Yeah, I realize this, but this is really important. - Come on, it's cold. Let him in, come on. Thank you, thank you. You're just gonna leave me out here? Go over there and play with the kids. - Play ball, make friends. - Why can't I...? It's freezing though. I'm cold. What's this about that you gotta come bother us today? Yeah, well, this isn't easy to say, but, uh, me and my family, we're living in a shelter. - What are you, homeless? - Just about. You hungry or something? - Dad, give him a few meatballs and: - That's okay, I didn't come here for food. - I didn't come here for handouts. - Come on, have a bite. Have a bite. I'm fine. Thank you very much, but I'm fine. Come on, my wife made 200 of them. Have a bite. You know, it's an insult to turn down an Italian woman's cooking. MoNTECELLo: Come on. - I don't wanna be insulting anybody, right? MoNTECELLo: It's good. - Sure, sure. Be good for you. Have a bite. - Wow. That's great stuff. The best. - You want more? - No, I'm great. It hit the spot. Thank you. Look, I know you guys are very busy, and I don't wanna take up your time, but the reason I'm here is, uh, I'm a boxer. And I was up for this big fight, and I got taken off the card. I knew I recognized you. You're the guy that got his ass kicked by Rodriguez back at the Garden, like two months ago. - I lost the fight, yeah. - You threw in the towel. I saw it on ESPN. You'd have had a shot if you didn't quit. Hit him with a couple good punches. You still would have got your head beat in, but you would have had a shot, at least. - As I was saying, um... - How can we help you? Well, that's why I'm here, sir. In order for me to qualify for this apartment, we need somebody to tell the people who are running the building, um, that I work for you guys on the books. - But you don't work for us on the books. I know. - You want us to lie? - No, I'm not asking you to lie. I'm not asking you that. I just need proof of employment so I can get my family out of this shelter, and all I need is a W-2 form or a paystub, anything like that. - We can't do that. No way. My family will be very appreciative. I'll work it off. I'll work weekends, I'll come here whenever you guys need it, - whenever. Holidays, I don't care. - No can do. Come on, vinny. It's Christmastime. The guy's down on his luck. Let's give him a break. Maybe we could do something with this. We can't do it. We're not hiring anyone on the books, and we for shit sure ain't lying to the government. Forget it. We'll lose our license. What happens to us when we lose our license? Huh? - For this? - All right. Look, I'm sorry. My son runs the business. If there was something we could do, believe me, Frank, we'd do it. Thank you, sir, thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your time. - Thanks for leaving me out in the cold. - You're welcome. I wasn't really thanking you. Now where are we going now? - In the city. - Can we get something to eat? Yeah, we will, in a little while, okay? What's that red stuff on your mouth? What red stuff? What are you talking about? The red stuff on the side of your mouth. Did you eat something while you were in there? I bet you didn't know that it's an insult to turn down Italian cooking, know that? You suck, you know that? You really suck. I can't believe... I can't believe you ate something in there. Hey! Hey, stop right there. Hey, I said stop. Stop right there. Yo, I said stop. Police. Stop right there. Stop. Police! I said stop! Stop. What's the matter? What's the matter? Come on. Get on my back, quick. All right, let me see, let me see. Okay, okay. All right. - Oh, man. - All right. Can you bend it back? Can you? All right, so you didn't break it, you just sprained it. Look, I'm gonna have to tie this up really tight, all right? - To cut off the swelling. I got to, man. - No, leave it. Leave it. All right, see? Hey, what happened to your hand? - When I fell, I cut myself. - Oh, Jesus Christ. Let me see it. Look, we'll clean it up when we get into the city, all right? All right, stick your hand out. Stick your hand out, come on. It's gonna sting a little bit, all right? Come on. Let me see. All right. - Where'd you get that? - I took it. - Oh, shit. - What's the matter? I can't eat it now. It has peanuts in it. - So? What's the big deal, man? - I'm allergic to peanuts. - Remember? - Allergic to peanuts? I thought you was allergic to, uh, raisins. No, peanuts. Well, that's what you get for stealing, man. Hey, look, I wanna say I'm sorry, all right? It's just that... Never mind. I'm sorry, man, all right? I'm sorry. Can you walk? Yeah, I think so. All right. If it hurts, let me know and we'll take a break, all right? Come on, let's go. Excuse me, ma'am, do you know where the Human Resources department is? - It's on the third floor. - Third floor? WoMAN: Up the escalators. Okay, thank you. Come here. Hey, over there. Go. Go sit down and rest your ankle. Go. WoMAN: Can I help you? - Yes, how you doing? My name is Frank Diaz. I'm here for the security guard position. - I was wondering, who should I speak to? - Sorry, they're all filled. Oh, wow, really? Well, are there any other positions available? WoMAN: You don't look like a perfume tester. Well, I can be very versatile. Look, we really don't have anything right now. Try back after the New Year. You know, what do you have to do to be a perfume tester? What do you do? Hold the bottle and say, "Try this fragrance, Chez Monet"? I could do that. Sir, move your foot out the door before I call security. Sorry. - Come on. Find something, man. - I'm looking, I'm looking. Relax. - What about this? What about that? - No, not that. What about that, a beautician in the Bronx? Oh, a beautician. Ha, ha. That's hilarious, man. You're really funny. What? How hard does it have to be to cut someone's hair? Gotta go to school for that. You can't just cut hair, - give a perm or a weave without learning. - Don't have to go to school for that. You do. Gotta go to school for everything. Not if you wanna be president. All you have to be is 35 and a U.S. Citizen. Look, just find me a job, okay? Just find me a job. Because I'm not gonna be president, and I'm for sure not gonna be a beautician in the Bronx. What about painting? - I can do paint. Where? Right here, 230 East 1 st Street. Good work, man, good work. Rip it out, rip it out. Hey, hey. - Hey, Jus. Check it out. - What? - Little girly over there. - Where? Right there. Oh, look at her. She's looking at you, man. She's eyeballing you. No, she's not. Look at how she just smiled. - Come on, do something, man. - No. - She's smiling at you. - No. Look at that. You're in like Flynn, buddy. Don't waste it. It's a great opportunity. Do something. Do something. - Wave at her. - No. She loved it, she loved it, look at her. I'm helping you out, man. - Stupid. Helping me out? - Don't call me stupid. Let's go. Let's get out of here. - You're not gay, are you? No. You ever get to first base? Second. You're lying, man. You never got to second base. - Did too. Kissed a girl. - Oh, yeah? - Who was the unlucky lady? - I ain't telling you. Better not be that girl with the wooden leg you always hang out with in the shelter. Little perv, taking advantage of the handicapped, man. - You guys even touch tongues? - None of your business. When you start hitting triples and home runs, you're gonna have to bag it, all right? Because you can't go raw dog these days. "Bag it"? What, what...? You never got to second base, forget it. Yeah, I know, I know, but what does "bag it" mean? What's wrong? Nothing, man. Come on, let's go. - How's your ankle? - It hurts even more. Just put the weight on the other leg. - Don't step on it. - Can I help you? Yeah, I'm here to apply for the painting job. - Come in. - Thanks. MoRRIS: You ever work in a school? Uh, no, I can't say that I have. A bunch of bratty kids with no respect. Yeah, it won't bother me. I got two of my own. You know how to paint? Yeah, of course. You know, I painted my own car once even. It didn't come out all right, but, hey, it saved a lot of money. Good. Principal Danner wants every classroom painted over the holiday break. - Step into my office. - Yeah. Hey, hey, do me a favor. Go sit by the radiator and stay warm, okay? - You smoke? - Yeah, yeah, sometimes. Thank you. It sucks they got you working on Christmas, huh? Tell me about it. All right, let's get this sucker filled out. - Name? - Frank Diaz. - Address? - 1873 Hunt's Point Avenue, Bronx, 11457. - Social? - 987-65-4320. This is on the books, right? Yeah, of course it's on the books. It's a city job. Pfft. Good, good, good. Where was your previous place of employment? I was working construction, but it was off the books. - Yeah, before that. - Oh, before that? - I'm a professional boxer. - No kidding? - Yeah, yeah. Why, you a big fight fan? - No, no, no, bowling is my sport. Bowling's cool, bowling's cool. What else? Uh, ever been convicted of a felony? No. Any medical condition I should know about? Not that I know of. Heh, heh, heh. Any problem starting today? It would just be till 3:00. I gotta get a jump-start on those classrooms. No, yeah. I can start today, man. Whatever you need. That's what I'm here for. You seem all right in my book. Besides, I needed somebody yesterday, um... - The job pays $ 12.50 an hour. - Twelve-fifty. - Yeah, is that a problem? - No, that's great. Twelve-fifty's great. - Well, Mr. Diaz... - Hey, hey, why don't you call me Frank? Just call me Frank. It's what everybody calls me. - Frank? - Yeah. Well, Frank, unless you changed your mind before you walked in that door, you got yourself a job. I do? Merry Christmas. Don't be so happy. It sucks working here. The doctor will be right in. - Okay. Okay. One, two. Good girl. Relax, you're gonna get better. - Hi, I'm Dr. Desai. - Hi. Hi. So what's wrong with this little cutie? Oh, she's been sick for three days. This morning she woke up with a fever. Oh, flu's going around. It sounds like you're coming down with it too. Everybody at our shelter is sick. Oh. Which shelter is it? Most Precious Host. It'll be a little cold, okay? There are better shelters in the city. There's Safe Haven downtown. That's for women who've been abused. What are you trying to say? I see a lot of women come here in need of help - and they don't like to talk about it. - I don't need help. My husband's never laid a hand on me. We came here to take care of my daughter. Can we just do that? Okay. Um... Can you stick out your tongue for me for a second? - Wide. "Ah. " Say "ah. " Ah. Okay, thanks. I've been down that road in the past, and I was smart enough to get out. There are better shelters, but that would mean leaving my husband. I was just giving you options in case you need them, but you don't. He's out getting the keys to our new apartment. - Our last day at the shelter. - Congratulations. Good news. She's got a lot of inflammation in her throat, so I'm gonna put her on an antibiotic. I'll just get the medicine and get you something for your cough too. Thank you. Twelve-fifty an hour, man. You know what that means? You can finally get me something to eat? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna get you something to eat on the way home. But it means Yankee Stadium, baby, you and me, opening day. - Sound like a plan, huh? - Yeah. I'm gonna get those seats on the second tier over first base where all the foul balls go. - Can we get hot dogs? - We're gonna get hot dogs. Hot dogs, peanuts, cotton candy... oh, no peanuts, man. - I forgot, you're allergic. - We have to have ice cream. - Yeah, ice cream. - Lot of ice cream. Tons of ice cream, tons of ice cream. Cotton candy, zeppoles... I'm gonna give you so much candy, it's gonna rot your teeth. But don't think about food right now, man. Because it'll make you hungry. We got two hours left, all right? Oh, we did it. Can you believe that? We did it. We did it, little man. Come on, give me five. Give me five. Uptown. Midtown. Downtown. - Oh, man, why'd you slap the brush for? - Come on, that's not funny. - You see me laughing? I'm not laughing. - Okay. We'll go cross-town. That ain't right, man. That ain't right. You think that's right? I got your hand, you got my threads. That's a whole other different story. - Frank, got a minute? Yeah, yeah. What's up? I was just about to start painting the wall right now. - Look, I need to talk to you. - Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure. Keep stirring it. Get to work, man. Help us out, all right? What's going on? Ran your social through the district computer. Felony charges came under your profile. Do you know anything about that? Felony charge? It said you spent two years in jail. Yeah, well, I... Something did go down. It did go down. I mean, I was a young kid, man, a stupid kid. Twenty-one years old. You know how that is, right? I was hanging out with the wrong crew. And I'm with them, and they go into this bodega, but I stayed outside and they took some shit. - I didn't even know they were gonna do it. - They held up the place? I don't know. I don't know. Like I said, I stayed outside, so I have no clue. But it was a big mess. It was a big mess, and I was guilty by association. And even the store clerk said that I wasn't a part of it. I couldn't afford a good lawyer. You know how that goes. - Frank, this is a problem. - Mr. Morris, I'm not that guy. Okay? I'm not that guy. That was a long time ago. It was a mistake, you know? I got a wife and two kids, man. That was the wrong time, wrong place, wrong friends, you know what I'm saying? - Frank. - It happens to everybody, you know? - I mean... - Frank. Look, I need these classrooms painted as much as you need this job, but the board of education has a policy: No felons near the kids. Now, I'm sorry, but there is no way around that. Right. Justin, come here. Hey, buddy, can I talk to you a second? I'm looking for a guy. Frank Diaz, a Latino guy. He's a boxer. He's about maybe your size. I used to pick him up here for work. I picked him up with you. - Sorry, I don't know him, man. - Whoa. It's a good thing, a good thing. I'm trying to do the guy a favor. I'm looking all over the place. - Sorry, guy, I can't help you. - Can you help me out? Aw. - Oh, man. Come on, stay over here till it clears up a little bit. You never told me you went to jail. Yeah, you never told me you sucked face with Peg Leg Patty. The things you find out along the way, huh? What you doing listening to my business? - I couldn't, I could just hear you. - Yeah, sure. Does Mom know? Yeah, your mom knows. - Did you shoot anybody? - No, I didn't shoot anybody. That's why your mom wants you to take up a sport, so you'll stop hanging on the street or end up in trouble. Matter of fact, you're signing up for basketball next week. - My ankle could be broken. - It's gonna be better by then. Now, come on, we haven't got much time. Let's go. - It's pouring. - Put your hood up. Find me a job. You're not gonna find anything today. It's Christmas Eve. You want a warm apartment? You want something to eat? Find me something. - You buy the paper or you put it down. - Relax, it's just a quarter. I'm running a business here. You look, you buy. - Oh, is that so? - Yes, that's so. - Oh, I found something. - What you find? Look, "Stockroom employees needed for holiday. " Where at? - Right here. Oh, it's Houston Street. Here, I'm putting it down. You happy? There you go. You happy? Let's go, come on. Wait, you can't go like that. - Why not? Because you're wet, you have paint on you... Yeah, so what am I supposed to do? - Get new clothes, that's what. - Oh, right. You wanna go to Armani's on a shopping spree? Barneys? - You don't have to spend money. - No? Because people are giving away clothes for free nowadays. - Just do what Mom does. - What does she do? Tell you when we get there. - Are you sure your mother does this? - Yeah. And she gets on me for cursing. Hey, help me pick out a shirt for these pants. - How about this one? - What, you mean like a pimp? Come on, man. This is more like it. This is good. All right, just stay here. I'll be right back, all right? Get your hands off! Hey. Hey, relax. Get off! - Hey, what's going on? - This your kid? Yes, he's my stepson. Why? - Just caught him shoplifting. What are you talking about? Hey, you, empty your pockets. Empty your pockets, or we're gonna do it for you. Hey, kemosabe, just relax, all right? This is a kid, man, please. Empty your pockets, man. What the hell are you doing, man? What the hell are you doing? I'm sorry. I don't know what the hell got into him. We have to take him in the back. Gotta write this up. Come on. We all make stupid mistakes, right? Come on, look, you got it back, right? No harm, no foul. It's all good, right? We gotta take him in the back and write him up. Look at him, he's a 9-year-old kid, man. We all make mistakes, right? It's Christmas. - Want me to pay for it? Sir, it is store policy. I know it's store policy, man, but it's not your store. I'll pay. I'll give you the money. Sir, what do you have on underneath that sweater? Oh, man, you know... You know what happened? We're gonna need some more assistance down here in the men's section. I was in the dressing room when I heard the screaming. I didn't get a chance... Go, go, go. Meet you at the newsstand. Go, go, go. - Whoa. Where's he going? - Come on. Let's just try to work this out, all right? The two of us, all right? Because what? Look, I'll give you the clothes, I'll pay you back, whatever. - We can work this out. - That's not the point. So, what is your point? The point is you have on a sweater that doesn't belong to you. I told you why, man. I was in the dressing room putting it on, and I heard the commotion. - Relax. - I came out to protect my son. - I am relaxed. - You don't seem relaxed. - I'm just trying to work this out. - Your voice doesn't seem relaxed. I'm trying to work this out. I said I'll pay you. - Back off right now. - You are not going anywhere. - I'm going... - You're coming with me. What the hell is the matter with you, huh? What the hell's wrong with you? What are you, stupid? You stealing jewelry for your girlfriend? No, it was for Mom. It's for your mom? VENDoR: Two fifty. - For your mom? WoMAN: All right, I think I'll... I think I'll give you some change... All right, just forget it, all right? Forget it. - At least I got the new clothes, right? - Yeah. Now, come on. Let's go look for a job. Come on. What's the matter? - Tell me. What? - Oh, man. I left my money inside the pants in the dressing room. - What are we gonna do now? - I don't know. I don't know. If I go back in there, I'm gonna get arrested. Jesus Christ. This is great, man. This is great. - Hey, excuse me, do you have the time? It's 2:15. Two-fifteen, great. Now I gotta get the deposit and a job. That's just great. - All right, come on, man. Let's go. - No. I can't walk. - What? - I can't walk. My stomach hurts. Your stomach doesn't have to do with your legs. No. I'm not going anywhere until I get something to eat. - We'll get something to eat at the shelter. - No, no, no. - Don't be a pussy, man. - I'm not a pussy. I'm not a pussy. Hey, don't do this to me now. Come on, man. No, no. I'm not... No. I'm not going anywhere until I get something to eat. I've been walking miles and miles, and my stomach is growling, and my stomach is empty. I feel like I'm gonna pass out. Justin, come on, man. I swear to God, I... - I want you to get up right now. - No. Justin, get up right now. Right now, you hear me? No. I'm done. I'm done. I don't care what you say anymore. Anymore. I'm hungry, and I want something to eat. All right. I'll get you something to eat. Are you happy? Come on. Finally. I'm not eating shit from there. - Are you listening? - Yeah, yeah, I'm listening to you. - Why can't we go to a restaurant? - This is a restaurant. It's the back of a restaurant. Try to find something that's wrapped. Yeah, I'm looking, I'm looking, man. Oh, bingo. Look. Look what I got. Look what I got. Look at this. Look at this. A perfectly good little jelly doughnut. Here you go. - It's fricking hard as a rock. - Yeah, it's just frozen, that's all. This is disgusting. Maybe if I hadn't listened to you and stolen clothes, we could have bought something edible. I've been asking to get something to eat for the last five hours. I knew I should have left you at the shelter, man. Yeah, you should. Leave me right here. - I'll get back to the shelter myself. - Trust me, I'd like to, man. - This isn't my fault. - Whose fault is it, man? Who got paint on my pants, and I had to get new clothes? Was that my fault, huh? Was that my fault? - It's your fault we live in a shelter. - What? What did you say? You do this all the time. What'd you say? - I said it's not my fault. - No, that's not what you said. You said, "It's your fault we live in a shelter. " I heard you. You think I'm a loser, don't you? You know how many families are struggling, trying to make it? A lot, okay? Wait till you have kids, boy. You're gonna see how damn hard that is. I'm not gonna have kids unless I can afford them. You got an answer for everything. Yeah, I have more answers than you do. You think I needed you in my life? Think I needed the responsibility? - You think I needed you? - Yeah, you did. You did. Or would you rather be with your real pops? Huh? Think you're better off with him? Go back, so he could beat you up for no reason every day. Shut up. Just shut up. What, now you don't have an answer, big man? You had a big mouth, but when somebody fights back, - you have nothing to say? - I'm a bigger man than you. - Is that so? - Yeah, it is so. I can make more money begging in an hour than you can in a whole day. Ooh. You're a big man. Ooh. I can read. And I can walk all over the city for five hours with a broken ankle, and you can't even get out of the corner and at least lose a fight like a real man. Give me that. You don't want the doughnut? You don't want it? Excuse me, can you spare some change? Spare some change? Excuse me, can you spare some change? Excuse me, sir, can you spare some change? Excuse me, sir, can you spare some change? I'm not talking to you, man. You're not gonna get anything like that. Merry Christmas. I'm not talking to you. Go back to the shelter, man. Go back to the shelter. You're not gonna get anything that way. Yeah? Hey, see, I'm not talking to you, man. Excuse me, can you spare some change? Excuse me, can you spare some change? Excuse me, can you spare some change? Excuse me. Spare some change? Excuse me, ma'am, can you spare some change, please? WoMAN: Sorry. Excuse me, sir, can you spare some change, please? Thank you. Excuse me, can you spare some change? Excuse me, ma'am. - Excuse me, ma'am. - Excuse me, spare some change? Can you spare some change? Merry Christmas. Excuse me, can you spare some change, please? Excuse me, can you spare some change? - Thank you, sir. Merry Christmas. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Count your money as fast as you can, all right? Hey, look, I wanna thank you for helping me out there, okay? Whatever. Remember when I was at the park trying to tell you something this morning? Yeah. I'm gonna tell you... I'm gonna tell you the most important thing that I'm ever gonna tell you. This is the secret to life. You listening to me? Like I got a choice. There's nothing to fear. Okay, come on. Say it. Why? Because I don't wanna waste my breath. I wanna make sure that you heard me. There's nothing to fear. Right, because fear is the worst weapon in the world. The most powerful weapon. People are gonna try to scare you into doing a lot of things that you don't wanna do, trust me. I mean, look where it got me, right? Look where I am today. Anyway, just know people are gonna manipulate you, and that's how they're gonna do it. You got me? - Yeah. - Good. Good. - So how much you got? - Hundred and forty. - Wow. - How much you get? It's none of your business. - Do we have enough? - Yeah, yeah, we got enough. We got enough. As long as I get a job, we'll be fine. All right, man. Come on, let's go. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic. But I'm looking for a job. - We're closed now. - I know, I know, but the trains... - Try another day. - Two hours. Two hours. - I'm sorry, I can't help you. - Give me a chance. Come on. What about the beautician job in the Bronx? It's 5:30, man. By the time we go back uptown and come back, we'll never make it. Maybe we could try a few restaurants over by the building. - No, it's over. - It's not over. Why do you always do that? You're always giving up. Hey, there's no shame to losing. I did my best, okay? Come on, man. I wanna make one more stop before we go to the shelter, all right? Come on. Hey, is this what Christina was looking for? You're buying her a present? - Yeah, I'm buying her a present, why? - What about me? - What about you? - I walked all over the city, sprained my ankle and starved for 10 hours, and she gets a present? - Look, all I wanna know is, is this what...? - Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Now go get something for yourself - and make sure it's under 20 bucks. - Forget it. Forget it. - No, go get something. - I'm fine. Why would you have brought it up if you didn't want something? - I don't want anything. - Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. Come on, you give me shit, and you make me feel bad for not getting you something, not thinking about you. Go get something. Go, go. Did you mean what you said? Said about what? About you not needing me around anymore. Come on, come on. Of course not, man. We were just arguing, that's all. What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? What are you doing, man? What's the matter? Is something wrong, man? Is your ankle hurting? What? - Do you love me? - Do I what? You always tell Christina and Mom, but you never tell me. That's because you're a man. You're a man. Come on. You're a little man, but you're still a man. Come on. You know I do, right? So we're men, man, and men don't do that. Imagine me dropping you off at school every day, saying, "Justin, I love you. I love you, Justin. " - You would have kicked my ass, right? - Yeah. You know, when we start... When we play-fight like this or I pound you on the head, right? When I pound you and give you noogies, that's me telling you in code, all right? I thought you knew that. No. All right, now you know, stupid. What was that? What was that? What was that? Come on. Throw a punch like the way I taught you. That's it, that's it. That's how I used to hit when I was your age, man. Go ahead. That's right. That's getting good, man. I'm gonna take you to the gym, but don't tell your mother, all right? All right. No, that's it, that's it. That's it. Hey. What are you doing? Hey, cut it out. What are you doing, man? Hey! Come on, stop it. Stop it, man. What the hell's the matter with you? People are watching. Hey, stop. Calm down, I'll let you go. Calm down, I'll let you go. All right. Here, baby. Hey. Give me that. - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah. - What happened, baby? - Oh, he's fine, baby. He's fine.

Some Christmas dinner, a nice-looking dinner somewhere, all right? How about that? Let's go eat. - Yeah. - All right? - The kid's starving, I had a long day... - Yeah. All right.

If somebody showed you a crystal ball right now, and they said to you, "This is where you're gonna end up," would you do it again? Come on, the truth. I love you, you know that. And you're the best husband and the best father in the world. But would I do it again? No. And neither would you. And that's just the truth. I don't feel so good.

We are completely full. We have no beds. It's totally full. I don't know what the hell to do. WoMAN Stand clear of the closing door. - What the hell you doing? - Playing a game. Don't play. Try me.
