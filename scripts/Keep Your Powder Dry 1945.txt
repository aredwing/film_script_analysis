For the WAC is a soldier, too We can type and file in the army way For the WAC is a soldier, too We can drive a truck, take our place with the best We'll be here to see it through We'll replace you here while you're fighting the fight For the WAC is a soldier, too Hut, 2, 3, 4, hut, 2, 3, 4 Hut, 2, 3 Oh, dear. Val! Valerie, come on, wake up. Oh, I don't dare open my eyes. Oh, my head. Mr. Lorrison's waiting. Who? Mr. Lorrison. Lawyer? Your lawyer. Oh. Tell him to go sue himself. Come on, darling, on your feet. Oh, my head. Oh... fine lawyer I've got myself. Prowls around waking people up in the middle of the night. Hmm. It's 2...P.M. Well, don't split hairs. It feels like the middle of the night. Oh, Valerie. Here. Put this on. Thank you, darling. Well, all I can say is, if Mr. Lorrison can't do anything about your estate, we ought to be able to sell that hangover to a museum. Oh, you can say that again. Oh! Well! Look at me, everybody. I'm standing. Well, you'd better drink that, or you won't be. It's my own secret formula... guaranteed not to rip, ravel, or tear at the seams. You'd better knock on it, Val. Oh... They're making terrible mirrors these days. Oh, uh, she'll be in in a minute, Mr. Lorrison. She's just, uh... she'll be right in. Good morning, Mr. Lorrison. Good afternoon, Miss Parks. You were a perfect lamb to come all the way up here, and I couldn't be more grateful. Sit down, Mr. Lorrison. All right, Valerie, all right. Now, I've just 5 minutes. What is it now? Well, it's the same old question. When do I get my money from the Rocked-Ribbed Trust Company of Measly Falls, Vermont? The Rock Ledge Trust Company from Mitchell Falls, Vermont. That's what I mean. I need it, Mr. Lorrison. Your grandfather's will is very specific. The board of directors of the bank are trustees of the estate, and until each and every one of the trustees is satisfied that... "that my granddaughter Valerie Parks is conducting herself in a manner typical of the finest traditions of American womanhood," no money. Exactly. Well, how do they figure I don't live right? Valerie, there's a record of spectacular extravagance. There's been... publicity of an unfortunate sort. Oh, pooh. A few gags and a little harmless fun. Pooh from your point of view, but far from pooh from mine. Well, what do they want me to do, leap up at dawn and milk cows? Tear across the country in a covered wagon? Have Old Glory tattooed on my chest? Or maybe they'd like me to join the WACs, the WAVEs, or something. That is an excellent idea. What? Valerie, you've hit on it. What did I say? Joining the WACs. Oh, now, Mr. Lorris... it's a stroke of genius. If I could tell the trustees that you're actually in uniform serving your country, it would be the best means of influencing a quick decision. B-but there must be some easier way... it's a great idea... great. Well, it may be great for you, but when I... you'll love it, Valerie. Best thing in the world for you. Fresh air, exercise, good, wholesome food. I'll have to rush to make my train. Wire me at the Belvedere in Washington the moment you're accepted in the WACs. I'll get busy at once. Good-bye, my dear, and good luck. Miss Corwin. Oh, but, hey, Mr. Lorrison, wait... well, how do you like them apples? WACs! Val, it might not be such a bad idea at that. Huh? We're washed up on the beach. You're broke, but flat! I know, but fresh air and exercise and all that solid food... Yes, but it sounds to me like the quickest way to get control of your estate. Oh, Harriet, fun is fun, but, honestly... You just have to go through the motions. You mean and get right out again? Yes. No, I don't think they'll let you. It's like a long-term lease or something. No. That's out. Then I guess I'm out, too. Well, it was nice being your best friend while it lasted. Look. What's to prevent my joining this thing and then, as soon as I get the money, coming down with general debility, blind staggers, or whatever it takes to get out? Great... if you could take it. If I can take it? Don't worry about that. I can take it, all right. Whatever I have to do to get this money, I'll do. I won't like it, but I can take it. Good. Come on, honey. Harriet, call the WAC recruiting station, make an appointment for me, will you? An appointment? I'll see you in my dreams Hold you in my dreams Johnny. Mm-hmm? How much did you give the orchestra to play that every night? How do you know I gave them anything? How much? 5 bucks. A night? Oh, Johnny... Sure. A million dollars' worth of memories for 35 bucks? Cheap at the price. Oh, no. Yeah. I'll get an apo number when I get to the port. You can use that till I'm assigned to an outfit overseas. Yes. I guess just "First WAC Training Center, Fort Des Moines," will reach me until I'm put in a company. Ann, if it gets too tough for you, if you find that you're getting tired or anything, you're to go right to the medico. Understand? Basic training is plenty tough. I nearly folded myself. When you were a WAC? Don't kid, dear. I'm serious. Darling, don't worry. I'm durable. You're everything. Darling... keep safe. Morning, Miss Rand. Good morning. Morning, Miss Rand. Come in. Good morning, captain. Oh, good morning, Miss Rand. Is the general busy? I think I can wangle him into seeing you. Do something for me, will you, captain? Why, of course. What is it? Announce me as "Private Rand." "Private Rand"? Go on. I'll explain later. All right. Come in. There's a Private Rand to see you, sir. Private Rand? Have I a namesake among the enlisted men? No, sir, among the enlisted women. I just received my travel orders... First WAC Training Center, Des Moines, Iowa. You've joined the WACs? But, Dad, I've always wanted to, ever since the corps was formed. Indeed. This is a shock. Without warning, for you to enlist... but, Dad, you don't need me anymore, now that you're going overseas. Do you know what I think about this? But it's right for me, Dad. I'm an army brat. I was born and raised on army posts. I think you'll be the all-fired best soldier that ever wore a skirt. Oh, Dad. I'm tickled to death, Leigh. I'm proud of you. Leigh, uh, don't try to run things, huh? Oh, of course not. I know better than that. Sure you do. When do you go? Monday. I have a little something for you, in the line of a going-away present. Oh, Dad. What a beautiful watch. Rustproof, shockproof, nonmagnetic, self-winding. It'll darn your socks, too. "Good luck, soldier." You knew all along. Of course. But I never said a word. Oh, you villain. You and your 20 years in military intelligence. Yes, and besides, you used your Aunt Eleanor as a reference. She told me all about it. Oh, I give up. Ok, darling. You angel. Keep your powder dry! Well, now, I didn't think the trip was so bad, did you, Mary? No. So this is Des Moines. Have you been here before? Are you kidding? Well, it can't be that bad, can it? It can't? Bro-ther! I played here once in a vaudeville act with a trained duck. After two nights, things got so tough, I ate the act... And the egg it laid, too. Here comes the colonel, girls. We should try to form some sort of a line. Dress it! Dress the line! Oh! Welcome to Fort Des Moines. Thank you. Welcome to the corps. Thank you. It's nice being here. An accident? Oh. We'll see that you get some sturdier shoes. Welcome to the WACs. Thank you, sir. Welcome to Des Moines. I played here in vaudeville. That's fine. Welcome to the corps. I'm awfully sorry about that. Oh, that's all right. But, after all, we were told to wear low-heeled shoes. I guess those trucks over there must be for us. Well, pull up your rayons, girls, and let's go. No, no. In the army, we wait for orders. Well, this'll be the first concrete mixer I've ever slept in. My mattress feels like a section of the Lincoln highway around Altoona, PA. I think I'll try this one. You know, they promised us room and board. Well, that's the board. In the army, they don't call it board. They call it "mess." And speaking of a mess, look at my hair. Say, has anybody got a comb? I went and lost mine on the train. I think the PX is still open. You can get one there. Oh, here. Take mine. Look, if we once start borrowing from each other, we're all sunk. Keep it. Thanks. Say, you know, when I saw them taking those pictures of you at the train, I knew I'd seen you somewhere. Small world, isn't it? And now I know where it was. It was in a magazine, in that cold cream advertisement. Confidentially, don't use the cold cream. Eats your face off. I think it's wonderful, somebody like you giving up everything to join the army. Don't you? We all gave up something. Well, I guess I'd better unpack. Personal belongings will go in the footlocker, with the exception of photographs, typewriters, and books, which will go in the wall locker. When we get our gi clothing, stockings, towels and pajamas will go in the footlockers, while the wall lockers will be sufficient for uniforms and so on. Say... What are you, an old cavalry officer? I'm from an army family. I happen to know a little bit more about this life than the others, and I don't mind being helpful. No, I'm sure you don't. But if I need any help, I'll send up a flare. You'll need help... lots of it. Look, Napoleon, I don't care if you were born in a tank and weaned on a hand grenade. I'll take my orders from the people entitled to give them. That attitude won't get you very far in the service, Parks. Oh, don't make any rash predictions, Napoleon. The name is Rand. It's going to be mud if you keep trying to ride over me on that high horse of yours! Ten-shun! Sorry, girls. I was just practicing to be a sergeant. But I feel funny sleeping in a room with so many people. At home I had a room all to myself, with only my sister and Aunt Sophie and her little girl. Oh, you'll get used to it. This your husband? No, we were just friends. But now he's helping an old gal spend her annuity. What's the idea of the picture? I just like to see him hang. Ha ha ha! Well, listen to this... the training schedule. 6:00, lights on. 6:30, reveille. Classes from 8:05 to 11:30. Mail call, 11:35. Is there just one mail a day? No, there's another at, uh...1630. If you'll pardon a question from a PFC... what? "Poor, foolish civilian." That 1630... is that the time or the year? You see, army time is counted straight around the clock. 1300 is 1 P.M., so 1630 would be 4:30. Just subtract 12. Imagine telling the boyfriend to meet you at a quarter after 13. There's a very good reason for it. If I were commanding a company, let's say, and I should issue a written order to the company to report at a given assembly point at 8 A.M., for instance, a mistake in a single letter... P.M., instead of A.M.... might be very serious. If you were commanding a company? That was just an example. Oh, I see. I think it would be a good idea if we were all to memorize the schedule. For the platoons compete against each other, and we must be sure that our platoon is the best. Teacher, if we win the blue ribbon, do you get to wear it in your hair? Listen, Parks, I've taken just about all I'm going to take from you. That's what you think. That's what I know. You're a bad influence, and I don't think I care to serve in the same squad with you. Well, maybe you won't be able to. You'd better wait until you've had a little physical training. That nightclub tan of yours is terribly becoming, but I don't think it's very healthy. Oh, you don't? Well, let me tell you... stop it! Stop it, both of you. You're behaving like a couple of children, and it's not fair to the rest of us. We're all going to have trouble enough living up to what they expect of us without taking time out for private fights. You're right. It won't happen again. I'll see to that. There'll be two of us seeing to that, Miss Rules and Regulations. Come in. Private Rand, ma'am, requesting permission to see the company commander. It's after hours, Rand. Yes, ma'am, but I noticed you were still in your office, so I took the liberty... if you'll read your regulations before going to bed tonight, you'll discover that a request for an interview with the company commander must be made through your first sergeant. Yes, ma'am, but paragraph "B" of that article modifies the regulation by stating that, in the absence of the first sergeant, or on a matter of urgency... are you suggesting that I do not know the regulations, Rand? Oh, no, ma'am. I'm merely quoting from the regulations. I see. You may continue. Thank you, ma'am. The recruit personnel with whom I arrived will be sent to the 4th Training Company, will they not, ma'am? You may assume that to be correct, Rand. I should like to be transferred to some other company, ma'am. Why? Personal reasons, ma'am. Someone you... dislike? Yes, ma'am. You're an army gal, aren't you, Rand? Yes, ma'am. You'll probably make application for officer candidate school? Yes, ma'am. Coming from an army family, Rand, you should know that the first indication of a good soldier, or a good officer, is the ability to get along with people. I think it would be much better if we both forget completely that you ever made such a request for personal reasons. Anything else? No, ma'am. And thank you, ma'am. Parks... Parks. I want to tell you something. I want to tell it to your face because... I don't do things behind peoples' backs. Tonight, I asked the company commander to transfer me away from you. I did it because... I don't think we'll ever get along. I realize now, in doing what I did, I made a great mistake. I should have known that the situation would take care of itself in time because, frankly, I don't think you'll ever survive basic training. Just a minute, Rand. I've got something I wanna tell you to your face. I'll be here as long as you're here, and anything you can do, I can do... better. That remains to be seen. Yes. Good night. Reveille, girls. Rise and shine! Get up. Come on. Come on, get up. Come on, up. Come on. Good morning, corporal. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Ann. Good morning. Val. Val. Go 'way, Harriet. Please go away. She's far away, out of this world. Val, come on, it's after 6:00. Now, come on. After 6:00! Now, now, you don't want to be late your first morning in the army. Come on, wake up. Army? What army? You'd better hurry, Ann, or you'll be late. Come on, I'll get your robe and your kit. Now, snap into it, Val. How much time have I got? 10 minutes! Oh... 10 minutes? I can't get dressed in 10 minutes. I can't even stand up in 10 minutes. Good morning. Shoes. Size? 5, please. 6 1/2... Approximately. I wonder what the lingerie is like? O.D. Pardon? The lingerie is O.D. Onder drawers? Olive drab. 3 rayon panties. Not very romantic, are they? It all depends on the way you look at them. Next. What's the matter? Just a little fixing here and there. Don't worry. We know our business. Look at this. A perfect 12. We don't need to do a thing to it. Good. 1, 2, 3, march! 1, 2, 3, march! Left face! Left face! Right face! About face! Take it easy, Parks. You're not doing the rumba. A little less on that vibration. Yes, sergeant. About face! Well, what is it, girls? Refer to your charts. You ought to be able to identify that. Refer to your charts. What is it? Well? P-63, King Cobra. That's right, Parks. Next. Well? P-40. Warhawk. Correct, Parks. Next. Well, what is it? B-29, Super Fortress. Correct. Next. Well? Somebody beside Parks take this one. Come on, come on. Ma'am. P-38? No. P-61. Black Widow. Correct. Good going, Parks. You know your planes. I know my pilots. Very good, Walters. Now, I want each of you to pick as your opponent the girl opposite you, and let's see if you've learned anything. Change places with me, honey. I'm going to show that Leigh Rand a thing or two. Are you ready? Go! May I help you, Parks? We're the girls from Fort Des Moines you hear so much about People turn and stare at us whenever we go out Hut, 2, 3, 4! Hut, 2, 3, 4! From all walks of society, we came to win the war But what did we do when we got here? We scrubbed and scrubbed some more Hut, 2, 3, 4! Hut, 2, 3, 4! They get us up at 5:00, the day starts with a roar Then what do we do when we get through? We scrub and scrub some more Hut, 2, 3, 4! Hut, 2, 3, 4! Fall in, fall out, fall in, fall out We're crazy about it, but We're falling in and out so much We're falling on our Hut, 2, 3, 4! Hut, 2, 3, 4! Hut! Hut! Hut, 2, 3, 4! Oh... Who ever said the army traveled on its stomach? Some general who rode on a horse. Oh! One week of basic to go, but I don't know. Will my feet hold out without a retread? What are you putting in for, Gladys? Cooks. Bakers and cooks, after being an actress? Listen, after 10 years of my kind of show business, give me a role with yeast in it. Radio and television for me. I got news for you. Me, too. Here's an old favorite. And what are you thinking about, pretty maid? As if I didn't know. Have you heard from him lately? No, not in the last two weeks. Oh, well, he's probably busy, and the mails are slow and all that, you know. I know. Annie... How did you ever happen to join the WACs? Yeah, how come? I'd cast you strictly for home-girl parts. Well, that's what we both want... a home of our own, Johnny with a good job, and... And no more good-byes. Maybe some children... And maybe a dog. That's for us. Well, how does "hut, 2, 3, 4" jibe with that? Johnny's doing his best to make it come true. This seemed like a good way for me to help. Gee, that's a swell old tune. Yeah. Give me the oldies every time. No... please, let's not have any more music. How 'bout going for a swim? I've had enough sun. How about it? Who's going in? I'll go. Ok by me! Sally? Oh, no, not me. I never touch the stuff. Come on, Sarah. No, thanks. I'll clean up the picnic. How about you, Leigh? Ok. Thar she blows! Well, here goes nothing. Come on, come on, come on. I'll tell you what. I'll swim anybody back to shore. Oh, you're too good for me. Aw, I'll swim sidestroke. How about it? Anybody? Come on, slowpoke. It's a dead heat! A photo finish! We'd better hurry, or we'll be late. Oh, well, you kids can stay in your wet suits if you want. I'm getting out of mine. Me, too. Let's go in the bushes. We'll be ok. Uh-uh. Wait a minute. Hold everything. What's the matter? A peeping tom? No, a jeeping tom. Well, hello. Oh, you're from Fort Des Moines? Yes, ma'am. Sir. Sir. Been having a picnic? Yes, ma'am. Sir. I'm afraid the food's all gone, though, sir. Oh, that wasn't a hint. We're working on a little problem. Problem? Well? It's becoming. Very becoming. I don't think I've ever seen another one like it. Darling, what about the money? "Everything going forward most satisfactorily," end quote, from Mr. Lorrison. Trustees think it's just ducky that I'm a WAC. And in the meanwhile you hang around here among those buxom lasses with the flat heels and the pure hearts. And I probably won't hang around here much longer. As of today, we're through basic, and tomorrow we move on to staging. Staging? Oh, don't tell me they put on plays. No, dear, they don't put on plays. You complete basic, you go to what is called staging, there to await orders to a special school or job. You know, I think you like playing soldier. Like it? Like getting up at 6:00 in the morning and going to bed at 9:30 and doing my own washing? Oh, darling, you're kidding. And ironing and scrubbing the barracks floors? And drilling every day, and going to 6 classes a day, and shining my own shoes every day? No, Harriet, darling, I don't like it, and neither would you. Of course, at the end of a week, you'd be dead. By my own hand, Val. By my own hand. But my hat's off to you. You're Superwoman. Yeah, I know. Well, I got to get back. We stand retreat at 5:00. And as soon as I hear from Mr. Lorrison, I'll phone you or shoot you a wire. Ok, lamb, but take care of yourself. Hi. Hi. Well, any news? Mary got her orders. Yep, camp fun in sunny California. Well, wonderful, Mary. A coeducational army post, oh, boy, oh, boy. Well, good luck. So long, old kid. Bye, chickadees. Don't forget to write. Bye, Mary. How long are we gonna be stuck in this dump? Oh, now, stop being so nervous. Nervous? Who's nervous? I'm not nervous. Oh, of course, you're not nervous. All you had for breakfast was coffee and fingernails. Well, if they keep picking us off one by one like this, we'll be here until we're old. They used to sit in staging for as long as 6 weeks. Now it's seldom more than two days. At least we know we're leaving sometime today. Thanks a lot, Rand. You make everything so clear. Here she comes. At ease. Rand, front and center. Good luck, Leigh. Thank you, Ann. Well, that takes care of Ms. Armored Force, off to run the radio and television school. Oh, now, Val, as long as you have to be with her, you might just as... ah, but that's where you're wrong, little Ann. Oh, but you applied for radio and telev... nuh-uh. I did a switch. I asked for motor transport. You mean just because of Leigh? Yes. Well, I think that's pretty silly. Why? Radio, motor transport, I don't care one way or the other. I've driven cars since I was 12, so I'll be ok in motor transport. Besides, it has a couple of big advantages. First, I'll get Rand out of my hair, and then I think I stand of chance of being near you. Well, I suppose if the two of you can't get along, it is better this way. Anyway, I can quit playing the referee, and we can settle down and have a nice, peaceful time fighting the war. I am glad, Val. At ease! Parks, front! Well, this is it. Hello. Hello. Well, Leigh, good news? The best. Motor transport, Oglethorpe. Oh, well, that's fine, motor trans... motor transport? But, Leigh, I thought you said something about... I know, but I did a switch. Oh. You did a switch. Because Val said that day at the picnic that... oh, Leigh. All right, maybe it seems childish, but that playgirl annoys me. I'm just as interested in motor transport. After all, I was brought up around vehicles of all kinds. Frankly, I'd like to be with you. And just as frankly, if I never saw that spoiled, snooty little face of Parks' again, that would be fine with me. What's so funny? Leigh, look, it just so happens... at ease. Darrison, front. That's me. Take it easy. Ha ha! Well, Parks, get what you wanted? Oh, indeed. Indeed I did, and you? Oh, yes, just what I asked for. Oh, splendid. For a modern-minded girl like you, radio and television seems just the right field. You know, Parks, I might say the same about you. Well, I made it. Oglethorpe, motor transport. Oh, Ann, that's wonderful. That makes everything perfect. At ease! All those holding orders for Fort Oglethorpe... Fall out. Well... right with you. Here we... but you said that... you told me that you... Private Rand, meet Private Parks, and in the middle, Private Darrison, all students of the motor transport school. Come on. Good-bye, kids. Bye! Can't hear you. Now, what's the big... where's my wrench? I haven't got your wrench. Now, wait a minute. Look, old ironsides, you keep your hands off of this truck. Ok, rattles, but give me my number 3 wrench. I haven't got it. Oh, Leigh. Were you looking for this? I lost my number 3 wrench, so I had to borrow yours. Hope you didn't need it. It's all right this time, Ann. Darrison, Parks, Rand, front and center! Here, look at your nose. Come on. Gee, I'll bet this is it. What? They're going to tell us if we made officer's candidate school. Gee, kids, I can't. I'm gonna be sick. Oh, come on, Ann. So, the general's car broke down. Boy, I thought it was going to be about O.C.S. I wish they'd tell me I'm not going to make it. Then I could bawl about it and forget it. Oh, why decide about it beforehand you won't make it? Because I'm a realist, that's why. Ha ha ha! My turn. Oh, for Pete's sake. Is the battle of the lightweights still going on? Why don't you two behave? What difference does it make who drives the truck? It doesn't make any difference. It's just that it's my turn, and I want to drive. Rather temperamental, that little car. Nothing but trouble since I bought it. In and out of the shop... I think we can take care of your car, general. Oh, you mean those girls? Yes, the maintenance crew from our motor pool. Oh, well, now, that's very kind of you, but I wouldn't want to put you to any trouble. It's no trouble, sir. Motor pool detail reporting, ma'am. Well, I'm afraid there's nothing you can do here. The best thing is to have it towed. May we have your keys, sir? What? Oh. Here. Thank you, sir. And? It's ok. Looks ok to me. Plugs foul? I don't think so. Get the top off the distributor. Right. Well, she's still sparking. You know, there's a fellow from my garage... they'll fix it. Oh, the points are probably burnt. Must be. Just what I thought. Nice. Here, you do it. You're better at it. Oh, ok. There, that ought to do it. Hit it again, will you, Rand? Sure. Will that be all, ma'am? Yes, thank you very much. Well, fine job, ladies. Thank you. Thank you, sir. May I ask the general if he's had his distributor points cleaned and spaced lately? Distributor points? No, I don't think I have. Well, I'd do that if I were you, sir. Fine, fine. I'll have that attended to today. Thank you. Amazing. Such pretty girls, too. And see how they went to work? I congratulate you, colonel. Thank you. Amazing, and such pretty girls, too. Poor old guy, he thought we were gonna wreck it for him. Bradley... I must ask Dad if he knows him. Hey, we did all right, huh? Oh, you're darn right we did all right. Just think, 13 weeks ago we didn't know a differential from a carburetor. I didn't, anyway. Me, either. I'm still an awful dope about mechanics. I can do it ok, but, Jiminy, when they ask us about theory... Oh, gloomy Annie, you'll pass the course. The general's car broke down I'll go sign the trip ticket. Ok. I wish Ann had more self-confidence. She can do anything we can do. Better. Rand, Parks. Now what? Front and center. Yippee! Congratulations. Thank you, sergeant. Oh, thanks, sergeant. How about this, Rand? We made it. Officer candidates. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Don't buy the bars yet, chickadees. It's a tough course. Wouldn't care to make a bet, would you, sergeant? No. Good luck, kids. I want to wire my dad. Leigh, what about Ann? Come on. Oh, Ann, honey. Don't, please. Congratulations. Oh, Ann, dear, you mustn't feel so badly. It's no disgrace. They only took 4 from here. And you should have made it. But I did make it. I'm just crying 'cause I'm so happy. Ann, that's wonderful! What a day. You know something? I feel great. Just great. Why, Rand, the way I feel right now, I even like you. Well, it's about time. What do you say we bury the hatchet? Well, if... If you'll just keep your hands out of my toolkit. I didn't... oh, now, wait a minute, Leigh. I was the one that borrowed the wrench, not Val. I tell you what, let's go to the service club tonight after we move our stuff, and the drinks are on me, huh? Ok, you're on. Good. Oh, Leigh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. My friends, this is a double celebration. Not only have 3 of us been accepted as officer candidates, but two of us have today buried a hatchet. On this auspicious occasion... suspicious, nothing, this is the McCoy. The real McCoy. Don't interrupt. I, graduate of the Bakers and Cooks School, true to our motto, "Reach for a can opener instead of a cook," have baked a cake. Look at that! Oh, you didn't. From a friend in the jungle. There was a time when a knife around here would be used for cutting a throat. But now, who cuts the first slice? You do it. Go ahead. Very well. Notice the smooth, glossy icing, the tender golden cake light as a brush of a swan's wing. Parks, where did we put that hatchet we buried this morning? It could happen to anybody. Not only is this cake a thing of beauty... a taste treat... but it is also guaranteed against termites. Officer candidate Darrison, Ann Darrison, office please. What do you suppose that's for? It's probably a date. And you're the only married girl in the club. Now, Ann, don't forget that we're you're best friends. I wonder if it could be... Mmm. Here goes 3 pounds, and I don't care. Gladys, this is absolutely divine. Same as I baked for the colonel's birthday, only more eggs. I'm Candidate Darrison, sir. I'm Captain Barclay. Bill Barclay, not that you care right now. But you will, honey. You will. That was for John. Johnny? What a lucky guy he is. Well, when did you see him? Oh, about 3 weeks ago. Uncle Sam sent me home on an errand. I'm going right back, though, tomorrow. How is he? How does he look? Has he lost much weight? Now, whoa. I'll answer them in the order named. He's fine. He looks well. But I forgot to weigh him. Captain, does he get my letters? Yeah, he gets 'em. He reads 'em. He learns 'em by heart. But he kind of misses that cute little... Throaty voice of yours, among other things. But I sent him a record. I made a record... yes, and it got there in pieces. He tried to patch it together, but every time the needle hits one of the cracks, you sound like a bullfrog with laryngitis. So I've got orders. You're to make another one now, tonight. And I'm gonna take it back, ok? Ok. Well, uh... Up to now I've been working for your husband, but I have a little personal problem. This is my only Saturday night in these United States. Captain, I think your problem can be solved. It can? Yes. If you'd come with me, I'd like to introduce you to my friends. At last, a girl with friends. I'm sure there will be enough for all. Thank you. You're welcome. I'd like you to meet Captain Barclay, Leigh. Hello. Bill, this is Candidate Rand. How do you do, sir? I'll tell you how I do in just a minute. Are you happily married, candidate? I'm not married. Well... In that case, at ease, candi-date. Leigh, whatever happened to Gladys and Val? They went over to the PX, but they'll be back. Well, as far as I'm concerned, Val and Gladys can stay in the PX. I like it here... Just as it is now. Ann, your husband's request, remember? Oh, yes, I remember. I'm going. Leigh, take care of this lonely heart for me till I get back. I have to make a record for Johnny. The first one was broken. Who knows? Maybe Leigh and I will break a couple of records ourselves. Leigh, ordinarily I would ask you if you'd read any good books lately. I would draw you forth on the subject of music, the theater, the cinema, the state of the nation. But here's how it is, darling. I have only this one Saturday night here. Leigh, man does not live by K-ration alone. There are other hungers. Well, could I get you some pop, captain? Oh, lady. Two can live as cheaply as one. Longest eye-blinkers I ever saw. Man could trip over those and fall. And, Johnny, I never in the world thought I'd make it. You know, they only take 50 out of the whole corps. I was certain about Leigh and Val because, well, they're sharp as tacks. But I honestly hadn't much hope. But anyway, I'm in. And now I've got to stay in and be graduated so we can both be officers, if not gentlemen. Well, darling, this is about the end of the record. I don't know what else to say. Except... Good-bye, darling. Take care of yourself. You're the best. I'll be seeing you. L-e-I-g-h. I'm putting you in in pencil. If you answer the next question correctly, I'll ink you in. The $64 question? The life and death question. Leigh, where are we dancing tonight? Oh, I can't go dancing with you. You can't? But you can't do this to me. You've led me on. You've plied me with pop. Pop. Come on, break your date. I haven't got a date. It's just that enlisted WACs may not go out with officers. Those happy couples I've seen in Chattanooga can't all be brothers and sisters. Well, if you've known an officer before, then you can get permission from your company commander. Well, get it, darling. Get this ration card. But, Bill, I didn't know you in civilian life. Now, wait a minute. This is no time for technicalities. Aha, this is no technicality. This is a hard and fast rule. You mean to say that I can't date anyone here unless I've known them for a long... Well, hello, darling. I haven't seen you in years. Valerie, this is Captain Bill Barclay. Valerie Parks. Hello, captain. Val, my goodness, how you have grown up. Oh, I've filled out a little, too. Yes, indeedy. Getting to look more like your father every day. Oh, really? Some people seem to think that I look more like Aunt Minnie, the one with the two heads. Ha ha ha! Must be a good 10 years since I used to dandle you on my knee. Must be. Course, I'm a little behind on my dandling. Aw. That is, since I've joined the army. Ah, but I'd know you anywhere by those eyes. Longest eye-blinkers I've ever seen. Yes. I touch my toes with them 10 times every morning. Valerie, this madman is a friend of John Darrison's. Oh. Parks. Let's see now. "P." Here we are. I'll just pencil you in. No, no, Valerie, I'll ink you in. Valerie, I've tried to explain to this man that enlisted WACs do not, cannot, and must not go out with officers. Listen, Miss Hard-And-Fast Rule, no sabotage. We're making plans, my niece and I. Oh, now, don't pick on my friend. Leigh is right. Val... And I'm inking you in. But she forgets that when a WAC and an officer are old, old friends... Yeah. But, Val, you'd have to make a false statement to the company commander. Oh, but it would be just a tiny, little false statement. Sort of a falsetto. But if they ever found out, you might be washed out of O.C. If she turns down a lonesome soldier, she'll be washed out of heaven. Well, here it is. Swell. John will love it. Ann, thanks for everything. So long. Bye, Bill. Thank you. Rand, it's been grand. Chattanooga, here we come. Ann, you better talk to Val. Now, wait a minute, Rand. What about? She's going to lie to the company commander and say that she knew Captain Barclay in civilian life. Val, if they find out, you'll get a reprimand, sure as shooting. Now that you're an O.C., why, there's... but who's going to find out? Come on, uncle. Well, let's plan our strategy. You want to meet me at the hotel in Chattanooga? Meet you? I'll go with you. I'll only be about 15 minutes. It will take me that long to get a pass and put on a new face. Never mind the new face. Just bring that one you're wearing. Well, you're the most beautiful soldier I ever saw. You can't come in here. You're supposed to wait in the day room. But it's nighttime, honey. Well, scat, honey. Yes, ma'am, honey. Come in. Candidate Parks would like permission to speak to the officer in charge. In reference to what, Parks? I'm going into Chattanooga. No Chattanooga for you tonight. You're C.Q. What? Charge of quarters. Oh, no, sergeant. I'm Parks. You see, it won't be my turn for a couple of weeks. Alphabetically it was Atkinson's night, but her parents are in town over the weekend. Well, I'm sorry, but I'd planned... well, I'm sorry, but Rand told me she knew you had no plans. Rand was misinformed, sergeant. Scrap it out between you. You're down for c.Q., and that stands. Yes, sergeant. I'm sorry, Val. But somebody had to keep you from making such a fool of yourself. Listen, you officious, smug double-crosser! From now on, as long as I'm in this corps, I will never speak to you again. I only did it for your own good. And if you speak to me, I'll slap you right across that smirk you call a mouth! Do I make myself clear? Perfectly clear. Ten-hut! Order! Order! Order! Arms! Dismissed! What a week! Amen! I thought basic was rugged. That motor transport course was no rose. But in O.C., they really mean it. You know what I'm going to do? I've got a weekend pass. And I'm going to buy all the Sunday papers tonight. Then I'm going to draw myself a really hot bath and soak for about an hour. And I'm not going to get up until the crack of noon. Sounds divine. Why don't you come along, Annie? Maybe we can still get a double. No, I think it's too late to get a pass. Anyway, I want to write a long letter. All right. See you later. Bye. Hi, Annie! Hi. So, is the iron maiden leaving us? She's going to spend the weekend in a bathtub. At the hotel. Tough. How we will miss her. Say, why don't you come into town with me? I received a wire from my lawyer, and I have to have dinner with him. No, thank you. I've got to... write a long letter! All right. I'll be back for bed check. Be good. Bye. Mr. Avery Lorrison, please. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Oh! Junior Vanderheusen! Surprise, surprise. Uh, no, I'm not surprised. I've always seen you in this condition. Did you get it here or bring it with you? I got it in New York, and I brought it with me! Oh... I see. Well, let's get away from this plant. You'll kill it. Junior, what in the world are you doing in Chattanooga? I... I beg your pardon. That's quite all... quite all right. Come on, junior. Junior, what are you really doing here? Are you going to join the WACs? I came down on my scooter. Me and Marco and Harriet... Harriet? Mm-hmm. Did you send that wire? Big joke! Yuck yuck yuck. I was stationed here as lookout. Been looking for you like crazy. Where are they? Upstairs, waiting. Well, come on. Val, you looks cute in that little soldier suit! Hey, that's pretty good! Oh, be quiet. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2... junior, answer the phone. 1, 2, 3. The desk again, telling us to pipe down. Who does he think he is, top sergeant? Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Excuse me, sir. Well, I'm a civilian. See, I'm 4-f; I got a wet brain. You can't order me around. Junior, take that hat off. No-oh-oh. I'm playing soldier, same as you. I said, take it off! Dance with me, my sweet. Marco, I don't want to dance. Answer the door, junior. Tell him to his face. Marco, I told you I don't want to dance. I beg your pardon. I have the room across the hall. I know it's early, but I came here to rest. Won't you please turn the radio down? She's a WAC, too. Everybody's WACs around here... it's an invasion. I'd be very much obliged if you could manage to make a little less noise. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Excuse me, sir. Marco, shut off the radio. Give me... oh, no, you don't. Junior, give me my hat. Valsy want her lil' ol' hat? Yes, I do. All right. There it is. Oh! Ha ha! You must be tired. All the time marching. Left, right, left, right. Here. Sit down. Oh, junior, don't do that! Now, give me my hat. I want to get out of here. Val, what's the matter with you anyway? You can't go now. We haven't settled anything. There's nothing to settle. I told you 90 times I don't know what my plans are. Ha! Army life doesn't agree with you. You used to be a swell girl... a lot of laughs. Now since they gave you a gun, nothing but grouch and gloom. Oh, you fool! You're still burned by my signing Mr. Lorrison's name to that wire, aren't you? Yes. But what else could I do? You wouldn't answer my letters. I had nothing to say to you. I tell you I don't know when I'm getting out. Oh, Val, you can't go on being so vague. If we're going to have any place to live, you have to sign the lease on the Palm Beach house. I'm not signing any leases. Oh, Val, you must! I committed you to it but definitely. The man took it off the market because I said you'd take it. Oh, if you're going to renege now... Val, you must sign it! Oh, all right. Here. You've stuck me with this white elephant, and you can live there if you like, but I'm not going to. Why ever not, Val? According to Harriet, it's but heaven. Heaven with a stunken tub, or sunken stub. Anyway, it's down. What do you mean you won't live there? Why? Because I'm staying in the corps. Are you crazy? No. But the whole idea was for you to stay there just... I know what the idea was, thanks. Well, it was your idea. You kept me dangling for months. I'm sorry, Harriet. I'd never ask you to dangle. I guess the money will be paid in time for me to meet the rent on this Palm Beach villa... I hope so. You can live there until you find a job. But my mind is made up. And all I want to do is get out of here. I'm not going to let you. I honestly think you've gone a little mad. Patriotism's all right, darling, but really! Drink this down. It'll sober you up. Make you a civilian where you belong. Have you 3 always been like this? What do you mean, have we always been like this? We're your best and closest friends. Don't tell me I was like you until a few months ago. I know it. I guess that's what makes me feel so sick just looking at you. You, scared green for fear you might have to go to work. And you, 26 years old and pickled in alcohol. And you, fussing around with swatches and valances and lyre-back chairs. So what? While the whole world is... do any of you ever read a paper or see a newsreel or anything? Oh, the idea! There aren't many of you in this country, thank heaven. You don't mean anything. Now, wait a minute. Who you calling names? Just because you got on a funny hat. We don't have to take it. Give me... ohh! Junior, give me that! Oh, no, you don't! Oh, you fool! Junior! That fixed her. She slapped me! You'd better go after her. And get my face slapped? I should say not. Oh, sorry! Hey, watch out for the MPs, sister. Thanks, sergeant. Taxi! Taxi! Who is it? It's Parks. What do you want? Leigh, let me in. I've got to talk to you. Leigh, I had some trouble with those people. I don't want to go into it now, but... a drink was spilled on my uniform. I wasn't drinking, honestly. I haven't had a drink all evening. My hat... well, that clown threw it out the window. And look at my sleeve. I know I have to be back by 1:00, but I can't go back like this. They'd think I'd been mixed up in a drunken brawl. Well... you believe me, don't you? I feel terrible having to come here... Letting you even see me like this. Then why did you? Leigh... You have a weekend pass. My uniform wouldn't fit you. No, I didn't mean that. Let me stay here tonight. Tomorrow, Ann can bring me another hat, and I can sew this jacket and get it clean somehow. Stand bed check for me. If your bed is empty, it's all right. They know you're off the post for the weekend. Just sleep in my bed. Please, Leigh. It's my only chance. If I were caught, they'd throw me out, too. Ok. Forget I was here. Yes. I figured you'd realize that I wouldn't ask this of you of all people unless it meant the world and all to me. What means the world and all to you? Staying in the corps. Since when? Since the first day, I guess. Oh, Leigh, you can't do all right at something as tough as this unless you really believe in it and love it, can you? Come on, Leigh. You know you can't. Leigh, I'm here now practically on my knees begging you to do this for me. To save your neck. To keep me in the corps. Suppose you do get washed out. Suppose they discharge you. What difference would that make to you? They don't do anything to you; You'd just go back to where you belong. Why should that bother you? Because being a WAC means more to me than anything. It's more to me than my pride, even. I can't be thrown out over nothing... over something that wasn't my fault. I can't, Leigh. I... I've just got to stay in. All right, Val. Thanks, Leigh. I guess I was wrong about you. Val, did you have a good time? Shh! It isn't Val. It's Leigh. Leigh, what on earth are you doing... quiet. I'll explain later. Here she comes. Hold it a moment, please. 4, please. Make mine 4 also. I wish to apologize for disturbing you last evening. Oh, that's all right. It was not all right. It was discourteous, and I try not to be discourteous, though I can't say the same for others. There are certain WACs who are not too polite. One WAC I can name in particular. One alleged fair-weather, fair-feathered friend. Naming no names... fourth floor. Permit me. No, thank you. My dear young woman, civilian though I be, noblesse oblige. This so-called WAC, who shall be nameless... just because a woman is in uniform is no excuse for dirty cracks, am I right? Please. Be courteous enough to answer me. No. You see? And a phony WAC, too, who only joined the army to get that money. So, where does she get off calling names? Really, I... just a minute. Suppose they won't take me in... ok. Maybe I did want to get in. Anyhow, I may have a wet brain, but what about her? I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about, and I don't care. There's such a thing as free speech even for a civilian. "Pickled in alcohol," she said. Then she slapped me. All the time she only joined to get that money. Do you think that's so patriotic... to join just to get some money? I would have joined for nothing. Well, do you? What money are you talking about? Val's money. Uh-oh. I shouldn't mention names. I'm no cad. I gathered you were talking about Val. Shh! "Low and mercenary though she may be, a woman's name is..." Come in and have a drink. No, thanks. I don't drink. Come in anyhow. I like your point of view. Who is it? It's Leigh. Open up. Oh, gee, thanks, Leigh. Never mind the thanks. I've just come from your friends across the hall. Nice people, and very illuminating. So you had to stay in the WAC? I risked being kicked out so you could stay in. It meant more to you than anything. "More than your pride." Pride? Well, you're a contemptible snob without duty or obligation. You're a phony. Go on. I shall. I knew you had some motive for entering the service, but I didn't suspect the real reason. I couldn't conceive of anyone low enough to pretend patriotism for money. Now, wait a minute, Leigh. If you'll just calm down, I can explain. Oh, save your breath. Don't go into your act again! I've got the whole picture now. You keep waving the flag until you get your money, then you kiss the corps good-bye and live in a Palm Beach villa. Ok, Napoleon. You've got the whole story from start to finish. And what are you going to do about it? I think I'll take a shower. I have a sudden crawling feeling. Then, after you're all nice and pure and shiny, you'll run tell teacher, huh? I'm afraid you don't understand how things are done in the army, Parks. I'm not interested at all in your private affairs, but there's a little thing called honor involved. If you remember, we had a lecture on honor our first day in O.C.S. We were told there was no room in the service for a cheat. No, I won't run and tell teacher. But I'm telling you that for the honor of the corps, you'll never graduate from O.C.S. If I can prevent it. And now what do you intend doing about it? This. That vile temper of yours will get you into a lot of trouble someday. Ohh... Well, you could see your face in that on a clear day. Wax, huh? But are we allowed to? Sure, I did mine a week ago. Passed inspection ok. At ease. Rand, don't do that. I thought it was the company commander. As acting platoon commander, I'm going to make inspection before the company commander makes formal inspection. I want to be sure our platoon makes a record this week. Parks! Parks, your hands are dirty. See to it they're clean before inspection. Yes, Rand. Your toothbrush, Parks. I believe you'll find that they're just 6 inches. I prefer to check them. Parks, what have you got on here? Wax. Wax? Floor wax. You've discolored the floor with that stuff. Get it off. All of it. Before inspection. Now, wait a minute. You were addressing me, Parks? Go on. No, I was not. I've had my floor waxed for a week. Do I have to take it all off? No, you can leave it on. Well, I'll be... Parks has to take the wax off, but you can leave it on. What goes on here? Oh, our platoon commander doesn't love me. I'll say. She's been picking on you all week. Laundry duty 5 days straight, extra detail on Sunday, police this, police that. This is the worst. Gee, I thought you were going to sock her there for a minute. Oh, no. That's what she wants. That's what she's been waiting for. And that's where she gets left. But why? What's she sore about? Oh, that's a long story. Well. Oh, darn. Look at that jacket. I think I'd better go down and press it. Can I do yours for you, Val? You won't have any time. No, thanks. That's probably against regulations. Come on, chick. Hi. Hi. I have a telegram for you. I signed for it. Read it to me, will you? My life's an open book. Ok. "The Rock Ledge Trust Company "of Mitchell Falls, Vermont, "today transferred to your New York account "funds in the amount of $639,000. Avery Lorrison." Holy smokes! Think of that. Gee, I knew you were well-off, but I didn't dream you were that wealthy. Yep. I am probably the wealthiest floor unwaxer in America. You know something? I feel great. Two days till graduation, and right now our last drill. I wish the last one was our last one. Why, Annie, how can you say that? With my dream girl Rand, my honey lamb, my pinup babe, acting company commander? Huh! She's waiting for me. It's her last chance. But she ain't a-gonna get me! Oh! Oh, Val, what are you going to do? Change it. On the double! To the rear. Halt! Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut. Hut. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut. Hut. Where's Parks? Rand'll skin her. Hut. Hut. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut. Hut. Hut, 2, 3, 4. You're late, Parks. I'm sorry, ma'am. Right face! Forward... march! Hut. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut. Hut. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut. By platoon. Column left! Column left! March! Hut. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut. Hut. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut. By platoon. Column left! Column left! March! Parks. Commands should be clearly given. Yes, ma'am. Let me hear you give the cadence. 1, 2, 3, 4. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Louder. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut! 2, 3, 4. That's better. Thank you, ma'am. Hut. Hut. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut. Hut. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut. Hut. Hut, 2, 3, 4. To the rear. March! Hut. Hut, 2, 3, 4. Hut. Hut... to the rear. March! Company halt! Left face. That was extremely slovenly, Parks. Sorry, ma'am. I did not hear the command. None of us heard it. No talking in rank. Yes, ma'am. McBride. Front and center. Yes, ma'am? Take over acting command of this platoon. Maybe you can make it look something like a military unit. Yes, ma'am. That's all. You are relieved, Parks. Take your place in ranks. Thank you, ma'am. Parks! Yes, ma'am? The salute is a military custom. Any halfhearted or careless salute is discourteous. Render the salute again. Again. Again. Again! Again! Again! Again! Parks! Take your place in ranks! Parks! You realize, Parks, that you're here to give reasons why you should not be dismissed from training as an officer candidate. Yes, ma'am. The report of acting company commander Rand states that as an acting platoon commander on this date, you demonstrated inability to properly command a platoon. And that you abandoned and refused to perform your duties, and struck her, and without permission left the drill field refusing to obey a direct order to return. Are the statements contained within this report correct? Yes, ma'am. Have you an explanation? No, ma'am. You've never before been on report for disciplinary action. No, ma'am. You make it very difficult, Parks. If you make no explanations, this board must act on the information contained in officer candidate Rand's report. The particulars contained in officer candidate Rand's report are correct, ma'am. There's nothing more I wish to say. You still refuse to make a statement? Yes, ma'am. Very well, Parks. You may go. Thank you, ma'am. How'd you make out? Oh, skip it, honey. Oh, Val. They're not going to dismiss you. I don't care what they do. Now, look, you've got to be sensible. You're throwing away everything you've worked for... all your hopes, your whole future! Oh, Ann, don't make it sound so important. But it is important. Annie, what you think of me means an awful lot. Leigh found out about my money and that I'd signed a lease on a house in Palm Beach. But I never intended to use either. Please believe me. I do believe you. But, Val, you are the most stubborn person. Why didn't you explain... Val! Leigh. Did it ever occur to you that... Commander Rand. Go right in. Officer candidate Rand reporting as directed, ma'am. Sit down, Rand. I wanted to discuss this matter of Parks with you. Yes, ma'am. Your report is rather severe, don't you think? It's correct, ma'am. I'm not questioning its correctness, Rand. You're too good an officer candidate for that. Thank you, ma'am. It must have been rather difficult to do your duty, knowing that at this phase of the training such a report is enough to prevent Parks from graduating. It's always unpleasant to bring charges against anyone, ma'am. Especially a girl who stood high in her classwork and with an unblemished record. Yes, ma'am. I see. Just... what is your personal opinion of Parks? I have never considered her fit officer material, ma'am. Mm-hmm. Would it surprise you, Rand, to learn that approximately 50% of the members of your own platoon do not consider you to be fit officer material? I... I beg your pardon, ma'am? I've been looking over these ratings sheets. You were called to fill one out, were you not? Giving your opinion of the military and personal fitness of each of the members of your own platoon? Yes, ma'am. Well, on their rating sheets many of your classmates have indicated grave doubts concerning your leadership ability and fitness for command. In fact, they seem to think that you're rather a cold potato. They question your ability to inspire confidence, and they place a question mark after your human qualities. There's no criticism of your purely military character. I'm sorry, ma'am. That's all, Rand. Rand. The really important qualities that go to make up an officer are not written in textbooks. It means a great deal to you to get your commission? It means everything, ma'am. I'm sorry for you, Rand. You've worked so hard to learn so many lessons so badly. Is that all, ma'am? As today's acting company commander, you did ride Parks pretty hard, didn't you? Yes, ma'am. In perfect honesty, just who do you think is responsible for Parks' conduct? As the acting company commander, I am responsible for everything that happens in my company, ma'am. That's all, Rand. Officer candidate Darrison is waiting, ma'am. Oh, yes. You'll want to see her alone, won't you, ma'am? Yes. That's all. Candidate Darrison. Officer candidate Darrison reporting as directed, ma'am. Sit down, my dear. I have some very bad news for you, Ann. My husband? Yes. H-he's wounded? He's dead? 3 weeks ago. I wrote him last night. But it's a good way to go, I guess. The best. 23...The third of may. Oh, God. I'm sorry. Would you like to stay here for a while by yourself? Yes, please. Oh, my God. I've been waiting for you, Ann. I need your help. I've never needed anybody before in my whole life, but... now suddenly I... I need somebody. I'm as good as busted out of O.C.S. Oh, no, Leigh. Oh, yes. But what's worse is that half the girls in this outfit think I'm the... the kind of a specimen you find clinging to the bottom sides of slimy rocks. Oh, that's not so. Oh, yes, it is. The commandant gave me a chance to meet myself. And for the first time, I... I guess I understand me. I understand my feelings toward Val. From the first time I ever saw her, she was everything I wanted to be all my life. A girl in... in high heels and furs. A girl who knew her power as a woman. The kind of a girl who... who lives in the pages of Vogue and Town and Country, not in an army camp in boots and breeches. I just couldn't bear to see a girl from her world make good in mine. The further she went, the better soldier she became. The better soldier she became, the more envious I got, and the more I wanted to see her fail. Leigh, don't. Please, don't. And then when I found out about the money and a lease she had signed on a Palm Beach house, I lost my head completely. She never intended to use either. She wanted to stay in the corps. I was even wrong about that. Wrong about everything. Don't punish yourself. Oh, let me get it off my chest. I've got to say it out loud to somebody. I... I just can't be whispering it to myself. Valerie Parks turned out to be a better soldier than Leigh Rand. Funny, isn't it? That's what I was afraid to say, and that's what I'm going to tell her when I find her. She's probably at the hotel. Ann, will you... Ann, you don't mind going with me, do you? I need your help with her. But I don't see how I can help. Oh... You've got so much influence over both of us. You're... you're so sane. You've made your own life so fine... and... with a husband that adores you and... please, stop it now. Stop crying. It doesn't do any good. Honey, you mustn't let yourself go like that. No matter what happens, you've got to hang on to yourself. Now, stop crying. Ann, you will go with me, won't you? I do need your help so. All right. If you think I can help. A compartment... an upper, a lower, just anything. Oh, come in. Well, all right. Thanks. I left word downstairs that I wanted to see no one, and I meant no one. Val. I asked Ann to help me find you. So you came looking for it, huh, Napoleon? Please listen to her. Oh, why? This whole idea is silly... women like me playing soldier. "Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am." Parading around, saluting each other. I was wrong from the beginning, and I'm sorry... terribly sorry. You're sorry? Oh, now wait a minute. There's an angle to this. No, there isn't any angle to it. I just want to square things. Oh, you want to square things? Ha ha! That's funny. Tomorrow the murder board will notify me that I'm kicked out of O.C.S. "Not fit to be an officer." And you want to square things? Well, I'm not waiting to get the boot. I've beat them to the punch. I've already resigned from O.C.S. As of today, I am through with the WAC. They can give me a dishonorable discharge or anything else. I'm going home, back to sanity, and forget I ever wore a uniform. Sorry, Ann, but that's the way I feel. Val, would it change your decision to quit if... if I told you that I weren't going to graduate, either? What? I had an interview with the commandant, and she told me that... that I was unfit to be an officer. Oh, I don't believe it. It's true. She said something else, too. She practically said that if anything happened to you, I was responsible for it. Oh, now I get it. I knew there was an angle. The colonel told you that if the murder board bounced me, she'd bounce you for using your rank to ride me out of O.C.S. Oh-ho-ho! You're here to save your own neck. You're not sorry. You're a... wait a minute, Ann. I'll go with you. No, thank you. Right now, I-I'd like to be by myself. Just be alone. Right now. Ohh. Ann took my bag by mistake. I found that in hers. She came here to straighten me out, and all the time she was dying inside. I couldn't measure up to Ann Darrison if I lived 100 years. And if she can take it after what's happened to her... Well, there are others in this army who can take it, too. Well, come on! I admit I forfeited my chance for a commission, ma'am, and I'm willing to go on as a private. I'm ready to take my medicine and start over, too. Very generous of you both. I'm sure this board is impressed with your having learned at least to subordinate yourselves to the good of the service. Have either of you any idea what it costs the army to train you to be officers? Over $3,000... no, ma'am. No, ma'am. Having made that investment in you, the army, not you, will decide what your future duty will be. So, your requests for transfer back to enlisted service as privates are denied. And your commissions as officers... approved. Holy mackerel, colonel! I mean, thank you, ma'am. Me, too. Thank you, ma'am. Oh, Ann, it's all right. We're going to graduate! Oh, I'm so happy! I'm so glad for you both. We made it! Attention! Sorry, girls. Still practicing to be a sergeant.
