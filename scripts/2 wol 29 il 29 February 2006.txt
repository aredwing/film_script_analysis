Or is it a lie? It's the story of a curse that recurs every 4 years on February 29th. Park Eun-hye, Lim Ho Lee Tae-woo, Lee Myung-jin Executive Producer You Il-han Producer Ahn Byung-gi Director of Photography Kim Woon-gwang Lighting by Go Young-gwang Line Producer Lee Anna Assistant Director Oh Hyung-jin Producer Kim Yong-dae Directed and written by Jeong Jong-hoon February 29 Hello. How do I get to Moonkyung Mental Hospital? Hold on, sir. Here's your change. Moonkyung Mental Hospital? Go straight. Take a left under the bridge. You'll see it to your right about 10 minutes in. Have a nice day. Did I scare you? Haven't you ever been in a mental institution before? You scared me! Journalists can have heart attacks too, you know. I haven't seen you in so long I had to make it special. We haven't been in contact for a while. What brings me here? I wanted to help you out by giving you a story. Why? You don't want it? I run a science column. I only report on facts. Have you ever met a stalker? I've seen and met things you wouldn't believe. What about ghosts? Ever seen one? No, but I'm sure they're easy to make up. They clone dogs nowadays. It's a scary world. What if I told you a body came back from the dead? What are you trying to say? Would you believe me? If the person is still alive, then he probably didn't die. You're talking like a true science columnist. Did you know that John Lennon was murdered by a stalker? Will you just get to the point? You'll see. Jiyeon? How do you feel today? It's beautiful day, why don't you go outside? Isn't it too bright in here? I can't even open my eyes. She doesn't like to be in the dark. In fact, she thinks this is too dark. How does she get her sleep? She's an insomniac. She hasn't slept in months. I brought you a journalist, you can talk to. He believes your story. Will you talk to him? Nice to meet you. I left in a hurry, so I forgot to bring my note. If there's anything I can help, I'll do it. Will you tell me your story? This is an unauthorized visit, so we don't have much time. My superiors can't find out about this. It's getting dark. Pardon? She comes to see me when it's dark. Who comes to see you? The murderer who died 12 years ago. No one believes me, But that woman is still alive. She even appears in my nightmares. She's coming to kill me. Why would she kill you? I saw her face. Her cursed face! What's the date today? February 29th. Please, Get me out of here. If I stay here, she'll come to kill me! Please! Let me out! It's too cold for this. This is too dark. Make up your mind! This is pretty. Hey! How's it going? Are you ready to leave the country? Hey there! Are you in Pusan right now? What are you talking about? I'm on my way to work. Don't lie to me I just saw you pass by! You need to buy me a drink before I leave the country. But I'm not in Pusan. I'm going to work. Aren't you wearing jeans and a lime green sweater? Do you have a secret boyfriend or something? It must be just a coincidence. It's probably someone who looks like me. Really? I could swear it was you. Why would I lie to you? Call me before you leave, I'll go to the airport. Okay, see you later! Look at you! You're so fresh and pretty. I wish I were fresh, I'm stuck at work all the time. Why don't we go on a trip? I heard we don't have to pay the full amount at once. Really? We could go for some fresh air, and we can lose some of these extra pounds! That's the hope I've been singing this tune for months. Would you say I've got a common face? Did someone tell you that you look like a clown? You'd never understand. Not with a face like yours. We're about the same. What should we do to kill time today? Just don't be late for your shift. Yes, ma'am. Good evening. Thank you. Over here sir. Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you. Is that Jongsook? What is she doing here? Jongsook? It's not time yet! Go back to the lounge. Why can't she hear me? Are we having a power out? This can't be... What does the rulebook say about a situation like this? This is awful. I'm terribly sorry. We're having a blackout. The machines are not working. Let me get you your change. It's already time for shifts! Time for me to get to work. I want to stay in that warm lounge longer. You scared me. - Jongsook? - Yeah? Did you see that car? What car? I didn't see anything. I guess you couldn't see it because of the blackout. Just before, some woman... What blackout? Didn't you see the lights go off? No. Everything was fine at the lounge. Hurry up. Before I don't rotate with you. Why did the power go out, Mr. Kim? The power didn't go out. I was watching soccer on TV. What's the date tomorrow? Tomorrow? It's March 1st. I knew it. This is why I feel bad for people born on February 29th. Why? February 29th only comes every four years, and sadly, it's my birthday. That's pretty sad. Do you want a birthday gift? It has to be very special. I only get one birthday in 4 years! In fact, why don't we take a day off tomorrow? I don't know. It'll be really awesome! I promise it'll be great! All right then. Drink this if you get sleepy. Jongsook? Have you ever received a ticket with blood on it? Of course! One time, I even got a ticket with poo all over it. Anything can happen here. See you! This is our news update. A tollgate employee was found stabbed to death last night at Dongseong Tollgates around ten-forty. The violence of this crime suggests careful execution and planning. In other news, a fire broke out last night at a schooling institution. Was Dongseong Tollgate near your work place? Yes. It's only 10 minutes away. The bloodstained ticket must have had something to do with it. When Jongsook told me about her birthday, I suddenly remembered that woman. Is February 29th a significant date? There's a curse on our tollgate. Every four years, people die for no reason on February 29th. Why? A few years ago, an accident occurred on February 29th. A prison bus exploded near our tollgate. All the criminals managed to escape, except for one person. Is she the woman you mentioned earlier? But they didn't find her body. It wasn't on the bus. Her body was not quite burned... It was gone. Did you witness the accident? No. I heard it from some people at work. That woman's spirit lived on. Every 4 years, she kills someone. From that day on, I began to see her everywhere. I knew I shouldn't have bought this on the internet. Everyone ends up having the same stuff! What is the matter with her? Apartment security. Sir? This is Apartment 808. Some woman's been knocking on my neighbor's door for an hour. That's strange I didn't get any calls. Will you please do something? I can't fall asleep. I'll check for you. Han Jiyeon? This is the police. I need to ask you about the murder at the tollgates. Have you heard about it? Yes. We need to ask you a few questions. Do you remember this? I heard it was you who received this ticket. Yes. It was me. Do you remember the face of that customer? No. There was a blackout, so I couldn't see anything. I didn't know tollgates had blackouts. What about the car? Did you see what kind? No. I just know it was black. And you didn't get the license plate number? No. I was too shocked when I saw the blood. Why didn't you call the police? Because. These things happen often at tollgates. That ticket was issued from Dongseong Tollgates. The time punched in the ticket matches the time of the murder. The lab is running the blood through tests. If it matches the blood of the victim, we'll have a suspect. Are you working late tonight? Huh? Yes. It's not an easy job. You should get some rest. We'll come back if we have anymore questions. Good day. You should be careful. These cases usually turn out to be serial murders. And the killer is usually among the people we first interview. Thank you. I'm not saying that you're a suspect. That's just what they teach us at the police academy. Good day. First, she presses the call button to page one of the employees. An employee runs out to help the customer. The murderer then stabs the victim with a sharp knife. Blood spatters everywhere. The ground gets covered in blood. The murderer leaves quietly, leaving the victim behind. The victim dies in a slow and painful way. Anna? Hey! Come to the first floor of the building. What are you talking about? I just saw you walking by. You're in a white jacket with a butterfly pin. No, You're mistaken. Why are you trying to hide from me? Let's have lunch with my boyfriend. It's not me! What's the matter? Are you okay? You saw someone else That wasn't me you saw. You look awful! I barely got any sleep. Did you hear about the person who died at Dongseong? It gave me the cold creeps. Why does it have to be a tollgate employee? I'm too scared to go to work. Are you sure there was no blackout last night? What if you were sleeping and you didn't know? Could be. I remember it got dark for a few minutes. Oh! Oh... I guess it's already been 4 years. Why? Who is that? Remember that murderer who died in that burning bus? That's her grandmother. She's got Alzheimer's, so she keeps looking for her. Does she come here every 4 years? Isn't it ironic? The day I was born was the day she died. Mr Kim! Jiyeon and I want to take a day off tomorrow. Ma'am? You can't stay there. Ma'am? It's too dangerous! Hey, excuse me... Show your ticket... Why are you so jumpy? Who left this here? I'm scared enough as it is. - Jongsook? - Yeah? About that curse... What curse? The February 29th curse? What if that woman is still alive? There was that murder at the Dongseong Tollgate. What if we're next? Did you see her ghost? Really? Last night, she came... You're kidding. Right? That's just a stupid ghost story. You should take some pills to help you sleep. Jiyeon? It's Inspector Park. There's been another murder at the Neunggok Tollgate. The victim was murdered in the same manner. Did you happen to see that car last night? I don't remember I was too tired last night. You didn't get anymore tickets with blood on them? No. The murderer had to have used one of the exit tollgates. But we can't look into all the tollgates in the country. The blood on the ticket was not from the victim. Then what was that car about? Whose blood was it on the ticket? There's something else. What is it? The computer had no record of a blackout. Jiyeon? What's going on? I swear I'm not lying. There was a blackout. Look! Computers don't lie. Think carefully. Are you sure you didn't fall asleep? Would you believe me if I said there was a blackout last night? That car was also there last night. Do you know you can go to jail for false testimonies? I can't seem to see the face of that person. I don't recall anything except the smell of something burning. That's impossible. Why haven't you seen his face yet? I know one thing for sure... There are deep scratches on the woman's wrist. But you haven't seen her face. How would you know it's a woman? I have an idea who it is. Who is she? It's the serial killer who died several years ago. That woman is still alive. What? She's been appearing everywhere in the same clothes I'm wearing. She's acting just like me! She's been killing people every February 29th! Don't you see? What's the date today? February 29th. Send this to the lab. But sir. And find out all you can about that serial killer. It looks like schizophrenic symptoms. A bad memory from dark is influencing her to sleep. It could be a form of insomniac that usually happen to overly anxious people. First, you should take some sleeping pills to help you fall asleep and later get further psychological treatments. The bus which was going to jail was overturned on a snowy road. A condemned woman was burned and died. She had couple of suture surgery. Jiyeon! It took a while for me to find this information. Plus, I got stuck in traffic. Do you recognize her? Yes! It's her! It's the woman who was strangling me. Are you sure? It's her. She came back from the dead to kill more people? Who's supposed to believe that? She didn't come back from the dead. She never died. The police report says she was burned to death in the fire. No, I know she's alive. We're not here to investigate the past. We're investigating into a murder that's happening now! You saw her strangling me! Don't you care about my safety? Fine! Let's say she's back. Why would she kill the people working at tollgates? Serial killers don't need reasons. They just kill. All right. Find out more about this woman. Talk to the inspectors who handled the case. Yes, sir. Who's at the tollgate today? Inspector Kim. All right. Let's stop by to see him. I need to check something out. Jiyeon? Are you going to work today? No, It's my friend's birthday, so I took a day off. That's a rare birthday to have. She only gets to celebrate it once every 4 years. Where's that ticket? You said you saw it on the wall. I don't know. It's gone. Yes. Are you taking medication? They're sleeping pills, I haven't slept in 3 days. It's no wonder, since you see dead people. Excuse me. May I ask you for a favor? Will you please walk me to the parking lot? I didn't know you went to church. Chew on one of these if you get sleepy. Maybe you should go see a doctor. I'm a professional, I've done this for 10 years. Whatever. Jiyeon! Jongsook? Where should we meet? I'm really sorry. I forgot to tell you. Why? Did you make other plans? Mrs. Lee couldn't come in to work today. So I agreed to cover for her. Since you have been exhausted lately. You can't stay there. Get out of there. Why? Is something wrong? You sound upset. Today is February 29th! Don't you know that? Are you still obsessed about that stupid rumor? I'm late for my shift! I have to go. Jongsook! Jongsook! Are you crazy? Get off the damn road! She's been wearing the same clothes as mine. She's killed so many people. I'm scared of that curse. It's my fault Jongsook died. I could have saved her if I was there on time. If only those inspectors had believed me. Why don't we take a break? We'll continue later. Come on. You don't believe me either. Pardon me? I can tell from your face. How can you tell? Your face make me sick. It's been 4 years since Jongsook died. If she were alive, today would be her birthday. That's right. Today's the 29th. If I die, will you believe me? Will you? Get me out of here now! The blood is from the murderer. We'll have to check the other ticket. But the blood on the tickets match. Don't you believe me? Truth is a relative thing. Everyone has his own side of the same story. If you had believed me, Jongsook would still be alive! Of course the detective, too... The DNA tests will tell us who the murderer is. Can I go now? I'm sorry. You must still be in shock. February 29th is over. Will the ghost return in 4 years? Will she? You need to get some sleep. You need to get some sleep. How can you sleep with all those lights on? I've been having some bad days. That all depends on how you see it. If you think bad thoughts, bad things will happen to you. By the way, are you sure you heard those knocking sounds? What? Nobody else in the building heard that, except for you. Jiyeon? Are you okay? We saw your lights flashing. Are you okay? Yes, I must be too tired. Is there somebody else in there? No, I live alone. We got orders from the top. We'll be with you 24 hours. Is something going to happen to me? Don't you remember how she strangled you? You must be getting no sleep at all. Are you working late again? Yes. It's too bad we can't close down all the tollgates. Call us before you leave. We'll come and pick you up. Thank you. Are you okay? You seem nervous. I'm fine. Let's go, sir. Yeah. We'll see you later. Inspector Park? Here. What's this? It's the car's license plate number. Where did you see the car? Did you see that woman? Yes, She's been following me since this morning She followed me to the parking lot... She's probably watching me right now! That car's been reported stolen. I suspected as much. Yeah? Issue a search for that car. Yes, sir. It's me. Can you issue out a search for this car? Take your time. I'm not going anywhere. I'm almost ready. Hey, help me! Jiyeon? I'm sorry! I meant to turn on the bathroom lights. I flipped off the wrong switch. I feel like she's watching us. Jiyeon? Can you hear me? Yes. Is it always this quiet at night? It's always dead silent. Something seems very wrong. There are many strange things about this case. Like what? I've been to a few crime scenes myself. But I never got this kind of feeling before. This killer doesn't seem to have any feelings for her victims. There's no sign of resistance from the crime scenes. They knew they were against a person with no soul. So what's your point? It's possible the victims knew the murderer. I guess we'll find out. It could be that woman who died 12 years ago. It could be her ghost... Or it could be someone else. Inspector Park? She's here. Inspector Park? Are you there? Inspector Choi! Wake up! Sir. I saw the car. I'm on it. Be careful. Don't do anything rash. I won't. What's going on? Is that woman really back from the dead? I guess not all ghost stories are false. I should give up guns and start praying for God. Is that the car you saw? I'm near the car. I think in the car, there is nothing. Just a moment, I have a question for you. The dooris, This is the police! Inspector Choi! Can you hear me? Hey! Do not leave your booth, do you hear me? Lock the door! Inspector Park? - Please. - Inspector Park? Are you okay? Inspector Park? Don't come in here. Don't come in here. Don't come in here! Go away! Go away! Go away! Please! Please don't take me as a lunatic. Go to the tollgate and see! I was telling the truth. If I stay here, she'll come to kill me. Please. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm not insane! I'll look in to it. I can't make any promises, but I'll do my best. Thank you for your story. Open the door. Jiyeon! - You're all the same! - Catch! You're like the rest of them! I didn't do anything wrong! I'm not crazy! Let go of me! You listen to me! Four years from now, I'm going to kill you! Mark my words! I'm going to come for you! Let go! What do you think? Do you think she was telling the truth? I don't know. I don't know what to think. Everyone here is considered insane. I don't know what to believe. Is she crazy, Or did she really see a ghost? Will this make a good article? It'll be interesting to track down a dead body. Want to hear something interesting? This is called the two faces of truth. The two faces of truth? Yeah. As far as I know, that woman has not been lying at all. She's only telling the truth. So everything she said is true? She told us the truth, but her story is not what actually happened. She told us what she believes to be true. But truth is a relative thing. I remember that day exactely. When I saw her first time, how can I say... I feel sympathy. Many memories are in patients' tears. You heard the story about the dead body. About the story of the ghost who came back from the dead. But the police report tells a different story. Jiyeon knew the face of the murderer from the beginning. The police had listed Jiyeon as a suspect all along. Han Jiyeon? This is the police. They discovered traces of someone else's blood mixed with the blood of the victim. The blood on the ticket was not from the victim. The police tailed her to the scene of the third murder. But they lost her. If they had caught her then, they would still be alive... I talked to the car owner. He's got a solid alibi. And his record's clean. That car's been reported stolen. I suspected as much. Yeah? Issue a search for that car. Yes, sir. It's me. Can you issue out a search for this car? Who do you think is telling the actual truth? What about the body that was lost in the bus fire? That incident actually happened. But the body was never found. But Jiyeon's just a woman How did she manage to do this? According to the record, It's possible if she drove 100 miles an hour. What if the police is blaming her, so they won't feel the heat? Are you starting to get confused? People fabricate stories all the time. Who's to say the police are any better? Our tests showed that she suffers from a mental illness. Her lawyer is pleading insanity. What's the reason for her mental illness? The reason? It stems from her fear of dark. There was a blackout that night, but only inside her booth. This confused the police at first. We made startling discoveries about her past. When she was 5 years old, - She got trapped inside a sewer. - Help me! She was rescued after three whole days. This fear came back to haunt her when she experienced the blackout. Remember. Truth is a subjective thing. Now it's up to you to make a story out of this. The truth seems all fiction, I don't know what to believe. If this works out, don't forget to buy me a drink. Why did you lie to her earlier? Today's not February 29th. I feel bad about that, but it was the only way to make her talk. Remember what she said? There's a curse on that day, every four years. By the way, You'll have to be careful on the next February 29th. Why? Don't you remember? Do you hear me? Four years from now, I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you!
