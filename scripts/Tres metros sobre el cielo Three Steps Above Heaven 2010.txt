Your honour, I've got Or your father, or your brother, or anyone in your fucking family. Son of a bitch! The accused will stand. This court finds Hugo Olivera Castro guilty of assault, Or the judge. And sentences him to 18 months in prison, commuted to a fine of 6,000 euros as this is a first offense. Or even yourself. Court is adjourned. You just want to run away. You must be careful from now on. There can be no more violent incidents. Another offense means you'll go to prison. Hugo, are you listening? - Why didn't mom come? - She's on a trip. And don't call me Hugo. Fuck. Get the hell out of wherever you are. Come on! And suddenly it happens. Something clicks. And you know that things are going to change. They've changed already. Dog face! Yeah, you! Dog face. And they'll never be the same again. - Bye, dad. - Bye. Never. And when it happens, you know. THREE METERS ABOVE THE SKY - Babi! - Okay. Hurry! Good morning. Silence. Silence! - May I? - Late. Close your notebooks, please. She'll pick me. Fernndez Camino, Luna Vergara, and Dueas Martn.... No, she's outside. Absent. So, Herreruela. Translation. Take your phone. Domus itinere eunte, moltus ambulantus fuit. Herreruela... On the way home he had to walk a lot. A lot. You'll have to study a lot to get into college. Cell. Miss Alczar, won't you take my call? Sit down. We'll continue. De strictus sensi cui super impia. Babi! I'm sorry. - It's OK. - Silence! Mara, doing it a few times doesn't mean you're dating. So what? Anyway, his pals told me he never calls. And you believe his pals? Just look at them. Claudio, change your tie. This looks better. - Girls, are you ready? - Yes, mom. If you want a lift, we're leaving now! With this make-up, how old do I look? At least 15. But I am 15. Let's see. Like that, you're about to turn 16. H! I wouldn't ask, but it's urgent. I need 400 euros for my bike. - It's in the repair shop! - Don't worry about that now. Chino! We've got a new contest on the Bandstand! Are you ready? The countdown has started! Who'll be king of the Bandstand? On your marks! Get ready! Go! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Don't act like you're desperately seeking someone. But I am. There he is! Dani! - Don't go.... - Hi, Rubn! Shit, with all that make-up I didn't recognize you. Would you like something? Yes, come on. Thirty! Thirty one! Thirty two! Thirty three! - Thirty four! - That's the first one down! Katina! I thought you weren't coming! I was at another party, but it was full of gays. A real bore. Someone else who was bored brought me here. That's him, chasing Berta's brother. Hello! - Happy birthday! - Oh, yes! Thank you. Want some? No? Well, the drinks are back there and there's a bar outside. See you later! I love this song. Let's talk to my new gay friend. Fifty one! Fifty two! Fifty three! Travolta, you're slipping! Fifty six! Fifty seven! Eighty two! Eighty three! Eighty four! Eighty five! Ten seconds! Come on! Let's have a final sprint! One, two, three, four, five, six... Come on! Seven, eight, nine, - and ten! - Ten! There's a new king of the Bandstand! Chino has lost his throne after two years! There's a private party up town! - Can we go? - Sure, I've got tickets! - Coming? - Not to a rich kids' party. Will you ever forgive me? I've been looking for a reason to do it, but I can't find one. Typical of a woman. See? That ''typical'' is what ruins everything. You're beautiful tonight. Tonight? Always. Alicia, your brother rang, he's coming with some friends. But I'm an only child! - Yes? - Hello! - Who's my brother? - Sis! Sis! There are canaps.... Listen to the music! My little sister! Close the door! What do you want? My purse. - Take it. - I can't. Some idiot got it first. Here. Didn't your mother tell you not to snoop in girls' purses? I don't know my mother. - But I'd tell yours something. - Really? What? You can't go around with just 50 euros. That's my week's allowance. - It was. - Now I'll go hungry. If you want, I'll buy you lunch tomorrow. You know what? When I'm paying, I like to choose my company. - What's that? - Never mind! Stop it! Stop! Holy shit! Forget about lunch. What would we do after? Tell jokes? Look, I wouldn't laugh at yours and you wouldn't understand mine. The jokes, I mean. Half-wit! If you dare take any alcohol I'll tell mom. Excuse me? Don't you remember? I accompanied you to school this morning. Well, I was your escort. You were the one shouting stupidities. No, I just said one. ''Dog face''. You liked it, right? It always works with girls like you. Like me? Up-tight and keen to break out. Do you want something? A Coca-cola, please. I have to drive. Babi? No, I served myself. See? When you're pleasant you're not such a dogface. What? - Chico! - Pollo, take this. No, put me down, you brute! Let go of me! No, no! I'm sorry I threw the milk shake at you! The damage has been done. You're out of your mind! I'm wearing a Valentino! - It's freezing! - It's good for the circulation. It pumps more blood to your brain. You offer milk shakes, you don't throw them at people. And tell Valentino the dress looks a lot better wet. The police, please. Shall I get you a towel? You don't want to catch cold. Go to hell! Move, they rang the cops! Remind me the next time we bathe together to wash your mouth with soap. Why did you do nothing when he threw me in the pool? Babi, it was all a set-up. I rang those idiots to cause a fuss so I could be with you. Roberta will never forgive you. They wrecked the house. What the hell? What are they doing? Go away! Stop it, please! This is my father's car! Bastards! You want aggro? - You're fucking crazy! - Go to hell! Are you OK? Shit! It's nothing. Just some scratches. - They could have killed us! - It's all right. There's still time. - I'm sorry! - Sorry? For what? Tell me. For calling the police or for the hit and run? You're so sexy. Leave him alone, you animal! You brute! Leave him alone! You're despicable! You want to grovel? All right, say after me: - I will not ruin the party... - Stop! I will not ruin the party for people who know how to have fun. I won't ruin the party... Please, help me! ....for people who know how to have fun. - Mr. Santamara! - What's going on? They're going to kill each other! Boys, that's enough! Let's get out of here! Babi, come with us! Fuck, it was your fault that I hit him! You made me hit him! Get in the car! - I won't.... - I won't ruin... That's it. Leave him alone! I hate you! You're an animal, a brute! I hate you! Put me down! All right, I've put you down. And he's gone. I'll say goodbye too. How do I get home? - Let me get on the bike. - What? Let me get on the bike. You said I'm an animal and a brute, right? I can't let someone like that take you home. It's for your own good. Tomorrow you'd regret not being consistent. Stop, please. Want to go somewhere? You want your face smashed? Scram. Scram! Get on, I've fought enough people because of you. Wait, wait. I'm paralyzed. You're squeezing me. If you grab my jacket I can't drive. Please... You want to stay like this all night? Sorry, I've never ridden on the back of a bike. So I'm the first, right? Shit! Babi! - Did you come on that bike? - No, mom... She had no choice, ma'am, really. The boy who was driving her dumped her and she had to come with me. Hi, mom! Didn't I tell you to stay with your sister! - Hello. - Hi. Get in the car. You two won't have any kind of phone for a week! You're exactly like your mother. A grouch. Are you seeing that guy? I don't even know him. He's Hugo Olivera, but they call him H. Something horrible happened and he wants to forget his name. My friends and I say it's H for ''hero''. He looks like he'd save your life. Who the hell let you in? - Get up, you've things to do! - Yeah, for you! No, I understand. But I could go to Paris next week and we'll close the deal. Alex, I need to borrow 400 euros. Fuck, what a drag. Wait. We'll talk to Head Office. Yeah, sure. OK. What are you doing? Give me that! Are you crazy? Don't give it to him! Don't speak! Don't speak! Yes, of course. In my wallet, in my jacket. Yes! - No, of course. - Thank you! Really, if he can't, I'll see to it. Hugo, remember about dinner with dad. Are you sure it's here? Yeah, I saw it in her diary, and we're having lunch. - You're broke. - She said she'd pay. - Hello. - Hi. That's her! - Which one? - The blonde. - Bye, Babi. - Bye. And that's the girl from the foam bath. I'm off. God, Babi! That's the guy who stole my allowance. - Which one? - The ugly one beside the bike. Oh, no! Did he steal from you too? No, but his pal threw me in the pool and wrecked Chico's car. You never tell me the interesting things! Hello. What are you doing here? Hey, take it easy. I just came with my friend, he's having lunch with that girl. But she happens to be my best friend and your friend stole all her money. You owe me one. Why not invite me somewhere nice? What do you say? Moron! How sweet! Coming for lunch? You can't have lunch with him! But he's paying, so I'll get some of my money back. I thought she was paying. I swiped her money yesterday so it's like she was paying. Don't be angry. I'll call you later. Excuse me. Just to show I'm not a liar, didn't you and I have a foam bath yesterday? That's a yes. - Hi, mom. - Hello, love. Why is your brother so late? You know him, he's always working. Where's mom? On a trip, with a girl friend. What grade will you get? In Physics? A distinction, definitely. I'm popping out. Do you need anything? No, I'll take a break later. Wrap up well if you go out. It's freezing. Yes, mom. Rebeca, did your son ever argue with that man before? I didn't even know they knew each other. With his injuries, if we don't have some proof Hugo could be in big trouble. Do you think I don't want to help my son? Hugo, have you nothing to say? I'm moving in with you. Don't you want to know how it went? How did it go? If you ask like that I won't tell you. - All right, don't. - Babi! Excuse me, that blonde hunk was giving you the eye. He's still doing it. Shall we follow him? Why are you looking like that? You dumped me and went off with that thug. Hey, you don't know him! He's got problems. He's got no money. His father treats him badly. But he's really nice. He asked me to the races tonight. What races? I told mom I'm sleeping at your house. - Leave a key under the mat. - I don't believe this! - Why don't you come? - No! I don't want to see him or his friend. Then we're not going to see each other either. - Why not? - I'm going out with him! Katina! - Babi! - Yes? Come here a moment. Coming. What? Haven't you something to tell us? The Santamaras rang. Felipe's nasal septum was broken, it almost pierced his brain! - I had nothing to do with it. - It's true, she didn't. Who asked you? Be quiet! Look, Babi, they want to report your friend. They want to know his name. He's not my friend. I just know he's called H. Are you defending him? How long have you known him? The only thing I know is his nickname! You know his name, tell them! - Do you think I'm a tell-tale? - You told me his name. Daniela, his name. Hugo Olivera. That's his name, dad. Call them, and say Babi had nothing to do with it. Great, Babi, you've really put your foot in it! Daniela... My parents are out. Yes, she's here. But I reckon that in a week she'll be dead. She informed on a dangerous guy, and she likes him. Stop talking about me and hang up. Wait, I've got another call. Yes? Yes, just a minute. It's for you. Yes? Good evening! Yes. Katina? She's sleeping. Shall I wake her? Yes, I'll tell her. Good night. Bye. What's going on? What is it? Who was that? It's turned off. Where are the bike races? The Siamese races? At the port. - Can I go? Please.... - No way. And don't tell anyone. Know where my sister's going? WE REMEMBER YOU No, stop, Pollo! What a surprise! I'm so glad you've come! Why is your phone off? Your mother rang. - What did you tell her? - That you were asleep, and she believed me. She's picking you up tomorrow at 7:00 for your blood tests. Don't be late, I don't want any problems. - Come on, stay! - No! We're going for a pizza. I doubt I'd eat the pizzas you eat. Well, it's the untamed shrew! Have you come to see me race? I didn't even know you were here. Then why are you red as a beetroot? You just make me laugh. - Yeah? - Yes. You won't be so cocky in court. I said it was you who broke Mr. Santamara's nose. - You bitch! - Take it easy. You could go to prison! That won't happen, OK? The day I'm up in court this nice girl will say I did nothing. Know why? Why? By then you'll be so crazy about me you'll do anything to save me. The race is starting! The race is starting! Want to ride behind me? Never. H, will you take me? Get on. Stop being scared and you'll have fun. You don't even have a belt. This is just for Siamese. So, race or fuck off. She's a real cow. - What did you say? - I'm racing now. Well, then? Give me your belt. Babi, no! Shit, my scarf! Get on! Are you crazy? Don't! I haven't got all day. Good luck! Belts off! Come on! Up! Up! Last lap! Chino! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Shit! Forget the bike, help her! Don't move her! - Lift her up! - Call an ambulance! Get on! Get on! The cameras! Cover the license plate! Hide here! I'll pick you up once I shake them off. Quick! Shit! I'm here. - Where? - Here. Why are you in there? Come out. There's a huge dog out there. There's no dog here. I still can't come out. Why? I'm embarrassed. Come out now or I'll leave. No, wait! Wait! What? Promise you won't laugh. I promise. What have you done, kid? - Are you covered in mud? - It's manure. That's manure? I don't believe it! This is too good to be true. I knew it. Your promises are worthless. - Wait, what are you doing? - I'm getting on the bike! Are you crazy? You're covered in shit. - You're joking, right? - No. If you want, you can wear my jacket. But first take off those clothes or you can't get on the bike. Fuck, this is disgusting! - Look, H... - I like how that sounds. It's the first time you've said my name. If you turn round I swear I'll jump on you and cover you with manure. And I do keep my promises. Don't look! I've got no interest in looking. I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry. You're a filthy, disgusting bastard! I didn't turn round, did I? But you've got a great ass. I wish I'd rubbed the manure in your face. Now I do hear a rabid dog. - Hurry up! - Look! Lift your legs or he'll bite you! Thank you for the lift. So I'll pick you up tomorrow. What time? Sure, and the police can chase us again. Right. You were a very brave Siamese. Are you going to report me? - Yes. - Yes? Really? Do you swear? Oh, Babi, Babi! I'm a pig, an animal, a beast, but you'd let me kiss you. - You're inconsistent. - And you're a bastard! You had your mouth open, begging me to kiss you. Give me back my jacket right now. Hot lips, what about a good night kiss? Go to hell! I was really worried. Your mom thought I was you and gave me a good night kiss. - What happened? - It was H, wasn't it? He tore off your clothes. You'll wake mom. Well? I'm going to shower. She smells of shit. Sorry, the police were after me. Liar, I saw you go off with that stuck-up little mouse. Illegal races cause disturbances in the port area Throw it up to me! Come on! She raced as a Siamese and saved a girl who had an accident. It's really wild. - Are you going out? - No! Sure. Katina, not again. I'm not going out. Look who's waiting for you Babi! You're seeing H, aren't you? If mom and dad ask, I'm studying at Katina's. OK. I'll be back by 11:00. I'm the hero's sister-in-law. H... Got a light? What's up? New projects. Good luck, I don't think that prude will open her legs so easily. I'll call you, OK? Vodka with pineapple. Dog face. Brute. Mom, why are you still up? Why are you behaving as if you weren't my daughter? It got late. Come here! - Were you drinking? - You know I don't drink. What's that boy doing to you? - Is he making you do anything? - Nothing I don't want to do. Is anything wrong? No, dad, I came home late, that's all. I got his license plate. - Talk to him. - They're just kids. Tell him if he doesn't leave our daughter alone, he'll be in trouble! Is that you? I want to see you. I'm grounded. I got caught coming home late. So it's not an urban legend. Nice girls who behave badly are still grounded. What will we do tomorrow? Go off somewhere. Pick me up at the school gate and take me away. I haven't been up that early for over a year. I might sleep in. I trust you, H. Good night. Bye, Babi. - Bye, Babi. - Bye. Let's go inside. I can't. H is coming. - We're going off! - What? You're going to screw! As your best friend, I want all the details. You animal! No, I'm really excited. It's like I was losing my virginity again. - There he is! Wish me luck. - Lots of luck. Babi! Relax your pelvis. Hello. Look who's there. Hugo... Hugo, please. Hugo, stop, please! H, what is it? Hugo, please, don't! In physics? A distinction, definitely. I'm popping out. Do you need anything? No, I'll take a break later. Son of a bitch! Stop! Please, Hugo! Please, stop! H, please! Stop, Hugo! Stop! Are you crazy? You could have killed us! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop, please! H! Stop, stop! Who was that woman? She was my mother. Your father and your brother don't know? My father thinks she's with her friends. Am I the only one who knows? Stop, stop! Why? We're out in the open. There's no one here. I said no. OK. Come here. Come on. Why did you bring me here? Don't you like it? My parents always brought us here when we were little. See the house that's for sale? Yes. My sister and I pretended it was ours. We used to see the owners and we imagined we were them. It's so sad. It's like we can never enjoy it again. I knew you'd like it. The jacket suits you. Who's calling? My mother doesn't trust me. Or rather, you. Is that like mom's signature? I think it's perfect. - Thank you for helping me. - Not at all. Don't go yet, come and meet my daughters. Girls, this is Gustavo, our new upstairs neighbor. - Yes, we've seen each other. - Yes. He doesn't know anyone, I said you could take him out and introduce him. Yes, mom, but not tonight. The girls have asked me to go to the cinema and as I'm not grounded any more I can go, can't I? I have to go. My pleasure. Likewise. Ciao. This weekend, if I can, I'll call him. That hunk is walking into the lion's den. You, ''Hello, Kitty". This is yours, right? You wouldn't have such good taste. The other night, H used it to tie me to the bed. It's strong. Not strong enough if you're here. Poor thing. You thought he'd promise you eternal love, eh? I feel sorry for you. It's obvious you're crazy about him. Give me the scarf! Give it to me! - Let go! - Give it to me! - Get off! - Let go of me! - Stop it! - Give me the scarf! Let go, you bitch! Hit her, Babi! Hit her, Babi, go on! Hit her harder! H! Shit, it's Babi! Let go of me! The next time, I'll kill you, you whore! I don't know what happened me. I didn't want to hurt her. - She said you'd been with her.... - Babi, Babi.... I won't cheat on you or hurt you. I'm with you now. With the girl who'll beat up anyone who insults her guy. You know what warriors do after their first victory in battle? Hugo... Someone wants a word with you. I'm Claudio Alczar, Babi's father. - Shall we go down for a drink? - Yes, of course. Hugo, we have to talk. - H, won't you introduce me? - Of course. Rosanna, Claudio. Claudio, Rosanna. - My pleasure. - Likewise. Sweetheart, you want olives or nuts? Olives. She liked you. She doesn't offer nuts to everyone. - No? - No. I don't really know where to begin. You see, my wife.... Olives for the best looking man to come in here this year. Married, of course. Claudio, I understand that your wife is concerned. Her daughter is with a guy who rides a motorbike, racing around at 100 m.p.h. Because I don't want to see things. But suddenly someone appears and says "Calm down", "ease up''. And when you ease up you become aware of things. That there's a dance trophy among the bottles of tequila. That my favorite song is playing. That today is Tuesday 13th. And that Rosanna would run away with you right now to the ends of the earth. Little things, Claudio. Your daughter is easing me up. And that's good for me. Not now, Alex. What wrong with you? Didn't you understand about prison? You can't just do as you wish. I'm sick of being your nursemaid! Stop messing around and behave like an adult! And what's that? Being old at 30 and not knowing how to enjoy life? Tell me! I'm sorry. - Mara Avelln. - Present. - Babi Alczar. - Present. Irene Catur... Here you are. Miss Alczar! Did your mother sign this? Yes. It's odd. I've just spoken to her and she didn't know you were ill. Nor that you were absent on Friday. She's on her way. You know that what you've done means immediate expulsion from this school? - Did they expel me, mom? - No, because we've donated 8,000 euros to the school. - Mom, I promise... - Be quiet, please! Stop making a fool of me. When did you decide to laugh at me? I don't know you, Babi. - Babi, what's wrong? - Stay away, Katina. And don't call! She's in on it too, isn't she? It's time you stopped seeing her. Katina said the teacher is screwing you around. They tried to expel me. My parents paid a lot of money to avoid it. They're going to lower my grades. I mightn't get into college. Are you crazy? You'll wake my parents! Come on. I'm not climbing down there. - I'm scared. - Scared? You're brave. Come on. - No! - Come on. - Where are we going? - Come on. Trust me, Babi. - Hey, Pollo! - Look who's here! - Great! - I didn't expect you. - I told you. - I bet 20 euros I didn't have. Get in the water! - I haven't got a costume. - Come on. No, H... I've thrown you in before. Stop... No! Come on, it's great! Save me, Babi! - Come on, you two! - Yeah, yeah. Stop! Stop, please! I have to tell you something. I'm nervous. Why? I've never done it. Me neither. Liar! Liar! Babi! This lunatic just asked me to marry him! I'm not in a hurry, Babi. You can't smoke here. I'll be brief. From now on, you'll treat one pupil very well. If I hear that Babi has any problem because of you you're in trouble. Don't waste your time threatening me. You're not the first. I'll just say one thing. Listen carefully. Pepito. Pepito! Fetch the ball! Pepito! The fucking ball! This dog must have a trauma. Like my aunt's dog, it thinks it's a rabbit. What's that thing? No insults! He's Pepito, and he's a slow learner. We bought him between us. - Who has custody? - Pollo. - But he's staying with his mom. - What? - Don't leave him here! - Better take him out or he'll piss on the carpet. Bye, Alex. What's wrong? If mom hears you're smoking in here, she'll slice you up. But I won't say a word. Shall we go see a movie? I thought everyone knew I'm grounded for life. We'd planned to sleep over at Katina's and now I can't go. Go on, and have fun. And mom? I'll take care of that. I love the smell of a pipe. It reminds me of when I was little. - Hi! - Hi! FOR SALE Wait here, and don't look. I hear the sea! What was that? Come here. There's a step, careful. More steps. Where are we going? I can smell it now. The sea! Like it? Well? I never want this to end. This is incredible. It was your house, right? I've bought it back for you. You're crazy! Now we're the owners. Are you all right? What do you think? Do you want me to be the first? And the last. Don't laugh. Relax, my love. Relax. I love you, Babi. Are you all right? - Did I hurt you? - No. I'm not very good, am I? You're perfect. You made me feel great. I'm happy. I'm happier. No, I'm much happier. - From here to Barcelona. - From here to the sky. Well, I'm even happier. How much? Three meters above the sky. Good morning! Why is she babysitting? Rich kids don't work. Her mother has stopped her allowance. Why did you bring Pepito? He doesn't like being alone. It upsets him. No, it upsets you. We mustn't be apart! Hi! You brought Pollo and the dog? He can look after the kid. Hey, champ. You're playing tennis! Get Pepito off the couch! - He's called Pepito? - Yes, he is. And I'm Pollo. What's your name? Show me your favorite part of the house. Come on, or are you scared of me? Come on, hit it hard. - Let's go to your parents' room. - No, come in. Sit down. - May I? - Yes. - What was that? - Don't worry, Pollo's in charge. That's what worries me. Who the hell do you think you are? A friend of mine? - I'm sorry, Babi. - Get this rabble out of here. - Get out! - Everyone, out of here. Get the fuck out! What were you doing, Pollo? I'm sorry. Parties here don't last long. What are they doing here? You get out too. I don't want to see you. Get out! You lot don't respect anything! Babi, this isn't my fault! Get out! Hi, this is Babi. Leave a message. YOU AND I OK, the meat should be rare with a little salt. - A little salt. - And the strawberries? They're in the fridge. No, that's wrong! Add the cream just before you serve them. And light the candles five minutes before she arrives. - Five minutes. - Right. - Why not apologize over the phone? - The dog! You're so unromantic! She's due at 8:00, but she's always 10 minutes early. OK. OK. - Yes? - Hello. Babi, supper's getting cold. Mom's looking all over for a ring her mother gave her. It's been missing since your friends were here. Is it always going to be like this with you? - No, Babi. - Leave me alone. Chino.... Watch it! I don't want any problems. You don't want any problems? Tough guy. Don't touch me! Look at him. He wants a fight. I just want the ring. H, stop, please! Stop, you'll fucking kill him! I've got the ring! I've got it! - H, go away, please! - Tell Babi to let me in! She isn't here! It's H! What'll I do? My parents will be here soon! Go away! Let me in, Babi! - I'll call the police. - I have to give you something. Why are you crying? Miss Alczar, can you tell us what happened that night? Miss Alczar, did you hear me? Can you tell us what happened that night? Babi! Wait! Why are you humiliating our family? What will they think of us? We promised we'd help them! No, you promised, I didn't. Stop being ashamed for me, stop deciding for me. I refuse to grow old and realize I've become like you. I won't live your lousy life. H is my boyfriend and I want to be with him. I won't lie for you again. You hear? If you keep doing as you please, we're through, I swear. Very well. I'll change. They've passed! I passed! Be quick, we've got something to do. I got the best grade! Forga gave me an 8. I thought she'd fail me. I'm proud of you. We have to go. - Where? - Pollo! - Come on, Pollo! - Behave yourself, Pepito. Don't gulp your food. You know it makes you sick. He doesn't want to go back to the witch. Who is it? Pepito Delivery Service. And don't dare treat him like you treat your pupils. You hear? Move, Al Capone! So long, buddy. There'll be more than 100 of us. No, not a private room, the whole restaurant. Yes, a very special occasion. Not just her good grades. A daughter doesn't turn 18 every day. I'll send the guest list this afternoon. - Mom.... - Yes? In case you'd forgotten, Hugo Olivera, my boyfriend. - Hi, Laura! Did you pass? - Yes. Come in. Good morning. I wanted to thank you.... Pepito? I want to marry her. First you need a job. Or will she go on paying for everything, like she does now. Tomorrow, I'm going to win. So she can see me do it. Our girls are incredible. We have to live up to them. She'll love it. - I'll get it. - H... Promise you'll be there. What do you think? Pollo... It's Babi! Here, take this. Hello. Can we talk? Sure. You threatened my teacher! Are you stupid? You screwed me, H. - I thought that if... - Stop thinking for me! Don't treat me like a moron. Let's leave it for a while. - Shall I say anything to him? - No. I'll be along after the race, OK? The dopey upstairs neighbor, he'll take us to the party. You're a fucking genius. Come on. - Have you seen H? - No, I haven't. Babi, come here a moment. Carlos, this is Babi. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. My love. A photo. What would happen if I asked your sister out? Her boyfriend would break every bone in your body. That's all. Hi, dad! Hello. Hey, where's your buddy? I want some fucking revenge. I'm racing for him today. I love you. Who is our daughter dancing with? With a good boy, Rafaela. Be careful! Stop, stop! Forgive me, I'm sorry, Babi. It's all right, Gustavo. I said it's all right. Leave me alone! She told you twice to leave her alone! Get out! I'm just trying to help her. What are you doing, H? He didn't do it on purpose! - Are you OK? - Yes. You think he meant to do it? Yes? Come on. I'm sorry, Claudio. - Katina! What is it? - Pollo. Where is he? They won't tell me. Look for him, H. Please, I'm begging you. Where is he? Over there. You can't get through. Calm down. Let go of me! Let go of me! Pollo! Let go of me! He's my friend! H! H, stop, please! Please! H! - Don't touch me! - Listen. - Don't touch me! - Listen. I can't take any more. Your life is full of shit and death and blood, you don't care about me. I do care, and Babi, I swear that... Don't swear anything. You don't care about anyone. Not me or your family or your best friend. It's not my fault! - Yes, it is! - It's not! Of course it is! You killed Pollo! You killed him! There's always a moment when the road forks. Each one goes off, thinking the roads will come together again. Come in. You see the other person getting smaller and smaller. That's all right. We're made for each other. She'll be there at the end. But at the end only one thing happens. The fucking winter comes. Yes, yes. Don't keep on. I'm eating well, Alex. There's someone at the door. I'll call you later. Merry Christmas! Come in, please. I haven't been around much these last months. I couldn't, I'm sorry. Don't worry. Santa left this for you. I miss him so much, H. I can't... Sometimes I think I'll never find anyone like him. No, no one like him. But you'll find someone who'll make you happy. Have you spoken to Babi? Have you? We lost touch after the accident. I think she's with another crowd. And she's going out with some guy. Maybe you should forget her. Want to stay for supper? I can't tonight. Some other day. Thank you. That's OK. Yes? Hello. Is Babi there? Just a minute. Bye, mom. Call me tomorrow. Take care of her. I will, Rafaela. Are you ready? We're leaving in five minutes. What are you doing here? - I locked myself out. - OK, come on. What's wrong? Hugo, what's wrong? What's happened? Suddenly you realize that everything is over. Really. I'm going away for a while. To London. To work. That's a good idea. I can't stay here. There's no going back. You feel it. And then you try to remember at what point it all began. And you discover it started before you thought. Hello. Hello. Long before. And it's at that moment you realize things only happen once. And no matter how hard you try you'll never feel the same again. You'll never again feel you're three meters above the sky. THREE METERS ABOVE THE SKY
