What would you say if I was to tag along with you and Emmy and Chiara this weekend? Oh. No, I understand. Congratulations, then. No, I'm... I'm fine. I need to go now. - You thought we were too sad and depressing for you. - I did not say that. No, but it's what you thought. - What if you are lucky tonight? - The odds do not look too great. It only takes one to be the right one. There... across the room... Your eyes meet... Bingo! Good luck. - Madam. - Thank you. It's that time. Take your seat. Ladies, you stay seated. Gents, after the next bell you move one table to your right. Chin up, girl. Yeah, you're right. What do they have that we don't? Nothing age can't better. You want to share? Suction. - Excuse me? - You heard me. Oh... I don't do that. I bet the little blonde he left you for does. Actually, the split was mutual. We did not realize what we had. No, you didn't realize what you had. Now it's a little too late. Things ain't what they used to be. We can meet the men we want now. So, get your skinny legs back out there and flaunt them. I remember my mom having the same conversation with her friends, in 1965. Right... Nothing changes. Is there one for me? Yes, indeed. What a relief. I'm dehydrated. - George. George Stone. - Hello, George. Hello? Hello? Do you know that your water is running? Is there anyone here? Report of a suspicious death. Is anyone near Ink Building? The one who alerted is waiting there. Someone nearby, come in. Any unit in the vicinity? Come. - Are you the police? - Mr. Green? Over here. Your lot asked me to come back here and wait. - Have you been in the flat? - Of course. Have you touched anything? - Who is it? - For god's sake, Mom! Stevie? You obviously like to sleep, hum? What's happened? No, Linda, I'm not being smart. I said I would talk to him. You know how it is, he is fifteen. We can't keep wrapping him in cotton wool. Sir, did we miss something? Where? Did we say that? Units are on their way here. Get the log going. What are you waiting for? A packed lunch and a goodbye kiss? No, Linda, not you. The door is this way. You look as lost as I am. That's what I was looking for! Guv? What are you doing here? Nineteenth floor. Stop staring. George did this to you? You're staying with him, aren't you? I know you are. Say that you're staying with that fucking shit. He did this to you, right? Sh! The baby sleeps. You don't remember having struck something? Did you lift something heavy? I'm sorry. Don't worry. Bone fractures are common at your age. It heals quickly. I'll arrange for some painkillers. It'll hurt for a while. Oops, sorry. Can you trace a number plate for me? - I have only part of the number. - Sure. Thank you. - Hello. - Can I speak to George? Are you a relative? Is he there? I'm afraid there's been an incident. George Stone. Not his best side. White male, 46 years old, separated. Prone to temper tantrums, according to the neighbors. Unless the autopsy shows something else we can assume that he was killed by... ...A blunt artwork. No forced entry, no signs of struggle. Valuables - TV and computer were left, and 7,000 pounds in cash. - Not bad. - Investigators received a call. It was traced to his wife, Janet. - I found nine. Should I continue? - No, it will be good. Neighbors have described a young male boarding. A backpack under the bed contained a digital scale and plastic bags. Brooks, find the flat mate. I'll get the spouse. The guv was first on the scene, at five in the morning no less. Mrs. Stone? Detective Frank. Mrs. Stone, I need to talk to you about your husband. I leave my card. Call me, please. It is important. What is happening? The police are here. I don't know. Hello? Hello? Hello? Emmy? ...Then we can have dinner, just you and me. Okay? Janet Stone, did not come to work. - What about her car? - Gone. She's on the move. - That doesn't make her a suspect. - I call her car, then. - Have you found anything about George Stone? - Slightly disturbing taste in porn, so far. - Is it across the border? - Not legally speaking. Great. Remind me why I'am here. Okay. Find me the flat mate. Anna? Everything all right? - Emmy! - Hello. - Mom, it's from three years upwards. - Hi, Chiara! I can take them. She was awake half the night. - What happened to your arm? - It's only a fracture. - I slipped in the bath. - I can't leave you alone for a minute... What about your dad? Emmy, I'm not stupid. He didn't show up. - I'm sorry. - You're not at all. Of course I am! I don't like to see you upset. - He isn't ready for us yet. - Us? You know what I mean. I missed you. Who is Allegra? - Got Allegra lucky? - Emmy! - Well? Did she? - You make it sound easy. Mom, these kinds of things are meant to help. Did you even talk with someone? All are terrible. I can't do it. Do not be such a snob. - Simon isn't speed dating. - Mom... Not everyone has to read books for a living. - What's up? You lost a fight to your girlfriend? - Yes, blood. - I ain't your blood. - I can't get the money. - I've got a problem. - It's sorted. - Huh? - Adz is taking care of it. Have you seen Adz? Bull, what did he say? Talk to me! - Back off! I'm not your messaging service. - What the hell, where did he get the money from? - Fuck off now. - I must know! Get the fuck out of here! Fucking dick. Kensington Elites Singles Night MURDER Witnesses sought. Can you help us? - Hello. Have you registered? - No. Well it's 40 entry, and you get two glasses of bubble. - What's your name? - Franks. - And the first name? - Kevin. I hope you find what you are looking for, Kevin Franks. Thank you. - Call me Lou. - All right. Thank you. Hey. Your name's Allegra. - My name is... - Kevin? - Have we met before? - Have we? I tend to remember faces and... I don't know, you seem familiar. - I guess I have that kind of face. - It's a nice face. - Would you... - Yes. At least you're honest... Oh, no! We're separated. - Of course... - Yes, indeed. I live in a hotel now... And you're out for a bit of affection to ease the transition? No, no, not at all. This is your first time? Is it obvious? Do you have any tips for it? I'm no expert, but the procedure seems to be: Man talks to a woman. Man buys free drinks. Man talks on about his accomplishments. Woman shows keen interest, but emphasizes her independence and self-sufficiency. - Then, there's the slow dance. - What's the slow dance? It's supposed to help us overcome our inhibitions. And... what's next? Then the drink's are not free anymore. It was an accident waiting to happen. I could hear it in my mother's voice: "He's so young, dear." Simon always said that we proved them wrong. But it was a matter of time... and biology. - Sorry to hear that. - It's okay. I have git Emmy and Chiara. That's the important thing. Three generations of single women in a one-bed flat. All laundry and mayhem... Bliss. - How... - It's a long story. So, is that the cure? I think so. Do you...? - It... - It's fine. Quite the dancing, hey? You're not so bad yourself. - Should we listen to some music? - Sure. - Should you really drive? - Not really. - You look very lovely. - You haven't seen me in cold daylight. Do you mind if I call you? No- Surely not. - Do you have a pen? - Yes. - Don't lose it, it's my only copy. - Anna. I'm Bernie. It's nice to meet you. - What a party! - Guests will be fashionably late. I did my best with what was available. And she makes some mean cocktail... - Cheers. - Cheers. Did you forget something? - You're having a quiet one? - We were trying to, so... Maybe you can just fuck of? Yeah? I'll just pick one thing. - It's late. I think I'll go. - No, stop! He's gone in a minute. This is Adz. Leave a message or signal. Adz, what the hell is happening? Don't say you did it. The police came to my mom. You need to call me. Please, call me. I am going crazy. Sorry. Excuse me? I would like to talk to you. Hey! - You look nice. - You are practically a married man, Kevin. - Did you get my message? - No. - Janet Stone found in Southend. - Good. The case is solved. She had a sixteen year old son from a previous partner. He tried to escape, but we took him. He had been beaten. - Can he be our lodger? - Yes. She wants to talk to us. - Do we have to go to Southend? - I can buy ice cream for you. - He won't call. - Well, he might. - Isn't there some kind of two day rule? - Why is the phone here, then? - That's my toothbrush. - I'm so sorry. - Remember the slow dance? - I'm starting to do it. I like these. - Where are you going? - I'll be right back. Okay. Bring something nice! Hi. Yes, we did that. We waited for two hours. No, I'm not. What, now? Look... I'll think about it. Come on, you. Here we go. He just freaks me out sometimes. I need to make her some feeds. Come on, sweetheart. - Who was that? - Huh? On the telephone. Well... Just a friend. - Is everything all right? - Oh yeah. Did I mention she took a few steps the other day? - Can you baby-sit for a while? - Are you going out? - Yes... It's no biggie if you can't. - No, that's fine. Hello. We are not available now. Leave your name and phone number after the beep. We will return your call. Who is Anna? Oh, she's just... nobody. Go on... Call her. I won't tell. There's nothing to tell. - You called George's apartment, didn't you? - No comment. - Why leave London? - No comment. Why didn't you answer the door? Why run? No comment. You feel this is helping Stevie's cause... You're wrong. - No comment. - All right. - Would you like a cup of tea? - The fucker got what he deserved! First Steven, let me get this straight. You and this Adam Taylor own to this dealer 15,000 k. You are desperate. You need George's cash, but he's refusing. - And then it gets a little out of hand. - It wasn't at all like that. I wasn't there, that's the whole point. He could not see me. It had to be Adz. You mean Adam Taylor? Yes. He was only supposed to threaten him, not... He wasn't supposed to do anything like this. Not like this. - And you say you called it off. - I did. I told him there was someone with him. He got mad and hit me. Adz did this on his own. - Who was there with George? - Some woman. He met many. Can I just see my mom? Hello? Is it... too early to call? - Oh, no. - I... I did not mean to wake you. I woke you up, right? - I had my eyes open. - I'm sorry. Never mind. Sleeping isn't really my for tie. What were you thinking, with your eyes open? - If you'd call. - I did. Yesterday. I didn't want to leave a message. - I mean, it could have been a fake number... - Women can never be too careful. I was going to call again a bit later, but it was just too late. Yes, six in the morning is much more appropriate. - When should I pick you up, then? - Tonight? - What if I'm busy... - Are you? Fine, then I pick you up at eight o'clock. - Is that real? - Does it matter? - Where's the guv? - Without trace and tail, but say nothing. - What is it? - We have Adam Taylor. - He robbed a wine shop on Sunday. - He was desperate. So what, you want to keep it for yourself? Leave a message after the beep. Guv? We got Adam Taylor. Hello, Emmy, it's me. I just wanted to say that he called. We're having dinner tonight. Don't wait up. See you later... Well, tomorrow morning. Bye! Come on, Bernie, answer the phone! - Oh! But you said eight o'clock? - I can come back. No, it's fine. But let me slip into something less comfortable. Oops, wait a minute... - They said the water should not be too cold. - They are beautiful. - I have to change. - Sure. How did you find me? - The phone directory. - You should be a detective. - Actually... I am. - Really? Detective Chief Inspector, to be precise. Though I do shuffle more paperwork these days than I do sluthing. Oh, I can see it. The sluthing, not the shuffling. I am amazed that it's not this cluttered with toys and stuff. - I remember my own chaos. - I do what I can in the living room. But Emmy's bedroom is a different story. - You've got some messages. - They're all for Emmy. I never get any calls. Not even from strange men at six o'clock in the morning? Well, I make a point of answering those. Simon put out a few crime stories. They didn't do very well. But then neither did the other stuff. - You would be good though. - Because I've seen it close up? - It wouldn't have worked out. - Why not? Because I'm a bit of a fraud. I'm not the cop that people think I am. Behind the worried eyes lurks your obsession with truth. Everyone, including my wife, thinks I'm married to this job. That I'm driven by the zeal for justice... But for me, it's always just been a job. I became a provider. - You got promoted. - I am diligent. So what is your calling? A man's greatest failure is not knowing his calling. I was told that a woman's greatest failure is no to want children. First date rule: Keep it light. Oh, I was the one who started. I thought we were happy, just the two of us. That was enough. Simon thought we needed more. So what about all the bliss and the mayhem? Oh, I never regretted Emmy. Or Chiara. They are the most wonderful thing I have, I'm just not really good with babies. - I left Emmy outside a shop once. - You wouldn't be the first to do that. - You know we've met before? - Where? Briefly, at the Ink Building, on Sunday morning. I haven't been there for years. But... I saw you in the lobby. We spoke. You must have the wrong woman, detective. Well... Where were we? - Did I say something stupid? - No. Oh no. I had a lovely evening. I have just got to get up... early. - Can I... - No, it's okay. - Good night. - Good night. - Yes? - Should I take the interview? - What interview? - Check your messages. We have Adam Taylor. I can't wait any longer. Okay, okay. I'll be there. Fucking pills! I saw dad. He seemed different. He did. He wants to see more of Chiara. He asked us over for the holidays. Me and Chiara... You think I shouldn't go? Of course, you should. He's your dad. - You look like shit. - Thank you. Where is Taylor? The sketch from Stevie's interrogation is ready. Hicock bets it's the woman you saw leaving the lobby. - Do you? - I'm not sure, but yes. - We can track her through the party. - What party? - Singles. Stone was a lonely hearts junkie; He signed up for a party that night. - Do you want coffee, guv? - No. - I got him! - Stop lying! Liar! Why lie about it now? Want to put me in? I'll kill you! Let go of me! Let go of me! - Shall we? - He's gone. You're fucking kidding me... Come on, come on! Answer! Excuse me, I'm looking for Anna Welles. - Come on! - No! You fucking bitch! - Yes? - I interviewed Adam Taylor. Forensics saw no trace of Taylor. However, there's plenty of party girl there. I can't talk right now. Just deal with it, okay? - Bernie? - Deal with it. What the hell is your problem? Okay, good. We got the woman's identity. Anna Welles. She calls herself Allegra. - Address? - I'll see what I can do. Anna Welles, divorced. Married name: Anna Matheson. Anna! Anna! It's Bernie. Can you open? Anna, I know you're there. I hear the water. Anna, please. Can I come in? Please? - Anna, we need to talk. - You look tired. - I haven't slept. - I'll make you some camomille. No, I want to talk to you. - I can't be seeing you like this. - It's okay. - So you say. - I mean it. - I have to change! - Anna, stop. Listen to me. I have nothing to... This is important. - Yes? - Are you with her now? - Huh? - I've got the plate checked. What are you doing? - I'm following a lead. - You have to bring her in. - She could be dangerous. - What the hell... She is Anna Matheson. Do you remember? Baby Matheson? Bernie? Bernie! Just get there. Four new messages. Emmy, are you there? I think I have found Chiara's green umbrella. You'll never guess where. I've been out. You see, I do listen sometimes. I'll tell you more when I get home. Hello, Emmy. I finished early today. I stop on the way home and buy some gruel for Chiara. Emmy? It's me. I just wanted to say that he called. We're having dinner tonight. Don't wait up. - See you later... Well, tomorrow morning. Bye! - End of the last message. I didn't want to wake you. You looked so peaceful. I'm going to make brunch. I hope you like omelette? You really don't remember the first time we met? Anna? Do you remember George Stone? Please. This is important. There is somewhere I need you to go. We should probably take over. - We have to bring her in. - It's not necessary. Bernie, she's a crime suspect. You don't know what you get yourself into! Bernie! - Look, Anna... - I know where you're taking me. It's okay. I need to do this. Anna, I can't help you unless you remember. You should take that. - Frank. - Bernie, it's serious. I'm dealing with it. Let's just take this one step at a time. Anna! Anna. Open, please. Anna? Anna? Hey, Simon, it's me. I was just wondering how... Yes, I'm fine, I'm really fine. I've been busy. What would you say if I was to tag along with you and Emmy and Chiara this weekend? No, I understand. Well... Congratulations, then. No, I'm... I'm fine. I need to go now. Anna! Anna! Anna. You don't need to do this. Anna. Please. Do not do this.
