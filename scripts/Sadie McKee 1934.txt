Mother McKee, give me a mouthful of something. I'm starving. Joe, do you like to be talked to while you're driving through traffic? I could walk in here blindfolded and know it was home. It smells so good. Mr. Michael, I'm so glad to see you! - Glad to see you home, sir. - How do you do, sir? He hasn't forgotten your cooking. - How's everybody? - Fine. It's the only kitchen in the world where you see the same faces. Let's see now, it's two years, isn't it? I thought you'd forgotten you had a home. I've been trying to get out to see you, but the family thinks I came to see them. Mr. Michael. Hello, Sadie! - Hello, Mr. Alderson. - Oh, oh, oh, oh. Michael to you. I'm glad to see you. I got a glimpse of you coming up from the depot. Yes, I know. I saw you, too. Say, what are you all dressed up for? My father told me you were selling hats or something. She helps me at the table, sir, when we have an extra. Oh, I see. Hey! What's happened to the freckles? I outgrew them, I guess. You did a pretty good job of outgrowing a lot of things. Thank you. You must like New York, you stay away so long. Sadie, I thought you were going to be a nurse. You know, when she was seven years old, she promised me faithfully, she was going to grow up and take care of the poor, sick folks. Yeah, and you were gonna be a prizefighter. Did you ever confess our foul deeds to your mother? - No. - Mrs. McKee, this angel child of yours used to sit up there in that corner... Wait a minute. - Joe, lend me that a minute, will you? - Yes, sir. I want to see how much Sadie's forgotten. Come on, do your stuff. Sadie McKee, of all things! Now, what are you doing? Tearing up that paper! Stop tearing that and get out of this kitchen. Do you hear me? Please stop. It's a wonder that I'm not driven stark-staring mad trying to keep this place clean. Michael, you horse thief! Come back with your father's breakfast. Mother McKee, chase me out. Make me feel at home. Where's the broom? Where's the broom? Here it is. - Mighty nice to have seen you all. - Get out of this kitchen. - I'll see you again, Sadie. - Run along, now. My dinner is spoiling. - Sadie, he came out to see you. - Oh, no. Sadie, did you see the way he looked at you? Oh, Mom! And the way he brought up things that used to happen. They never meant anything. Well, it don't do no harm to look your prettiest. - Mom, will you have some sense? - Well, I wish you had some. You'd look higher than that Tommy Wallace. Please don't. Tommy's in trouble. Yes, I know. He lost his job. Yeah, I heard about Tommy being fired. - Where'd you hear that? - Down at the pool hall. Did they say anything mean about Tommy? Oh, they said he was a nice enough fellow, maybe just a little bit crooked. That's my idea of a pretty rotten joke. All right, Sadie, remove the cocktail service. Now, look pleasant. Smile. His name is Tommy Wallace. Well, maybe I sound a little tough, but the country's trying to get back to old-fashioned honesty. Every chance we get to make an example of someone, we ought to let the honest people know we're backing them up. Quite right. I remember him in high school. Cheated his way through, ponied his exams, never a whale of a character. Mom, he's turning them against Tommy, Michael is. And likely he's right. Now, you be a good girl, dearie. Okay, Mom. Your father wants to put him back to work with a little friendly advice. Well, it's a kind of petty graft, it isn't really like stealing anything. Well, I've practiced law in New York several years. Everyone who ever got sloppy about crooks has been sold out. I think we ought to listen to Michael. I think so, too. - Somebody take these before I drop them. - Why, what's the matter with you, Sadie? - You can get the rest yourself. - My word. My word. Mr. Alderson was gonna take him back, but Michael won't let him. Now, you go do your work, Sadie McKee. Big-shot lawyer from New York says they must make an example of Tommy. Sadie, anything about us servants stops at that door. All right, Sadie, you may serve the soup. Sadie! Sadie! Okay, Mom, but I just saw blazing red, that's all. The taste of easy, crooked money is worse than blood to a tiger. They never figure to get it honestly after that. If you put him back, you tell your 3,000 honest employees it doesn't make any difference whether they're honest or not. I don't care. I couldn't help it, but I don't care. Why, Sadie! You're only lucky I didn't throw it in your face. Why, you'd think you were talking about a mongrel pup that went a little bit mad or something. Just because you're the mighty Aldersons, and you live on top of the hill and own the town, you're gonna kick a poor kid into the gutter for something he didn't do, just to show the world you're good Americans. I think you're rotten, and I think you're cruel. We'll make you eat every word you've said, Tommy and me, before we're through. I'm glad I said it. And as far as I'm concerned, to the devil with all of you! Well! Did I say thoroughbred? Didn't I? All aboard! - Don't you let them worry you, baby. I'll get a job right away, and I'll send for you. When you come to New York, we'll be married. - Tommy, I can't let you go. I just can't. - I know, darling, but I've got to. I couldn't get a job here now, anyway. Not a chance. - Yeah, I know. All aboard! You won't forget how much I love you, will you? I'll be thinking of you every minute. All aboard. - Goodbye. All aboard. I'm so afraid with you in New York! Well, don't you be worried. I can take care of myself. But it's such a big town. I'm scared! Now, don't you worry. Goodbye. - Take care of yourself and I love you. - You take care of yourself, too. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Holy smoke! Hey. What do you think you're doing? I went blind when that train started out. I just couldn't help it. And I'm sitting here wondering how long it's gonna be till I see you again. - Were you thinking that, Tommy? Honest? - Sure I was, but look here, Sadie... I know, but I haven't any more right back there than you have, after that row I started in the dining room. Gee, Mother's so hurt. - You sure went to the mat for me. - The things Michael said. I couldn't help it. Well, look here, Sadie. What are we going to do? I don't care, just as long as we're together. - Sure, but the way things are... - I don't care if you don't. There's nothing any place, Tommy, if I'm not with you, and I don't care how tough things are if I am. You're some girl, Sadie. There's one thing. In New York, we can get married right away. I mean, we don't have to wait for anything. Okay, baby, okay. Will we make that town say uncle? Look out, New York. Here we come. And a cup of coffee. Gee, that looks good. I wonder how much it costs. Forty cents. Up a dime since last week. Tommy, look. Corned beef hash and poached eggs for 30 cents. Want it? Two corned beef hashes. Coffee? - How much is coffee? - Five cents. One coffee. - I beg your pardon. - Sure. - We're strangers here. - No! We want to find a place to live and we don't know where to look. So you kids thought you'd go to town, huh? Well, you got a grip. You can go to a hotel. Everything will be jake. Well, we want to find rooms to rent that don't cost much. Oh, I got you. Well, you're talking to an expert. That's where I live. Bathroom on every floor, standing room only Saturday night. - Well, I guess if it's good enough for you. - It ain't good enough for me, not near! Honeymoon? - Well... - In a way. Oh, in a way, huh? Well, New York will give you a chance to try it out. - Go ahead and eat. I'll wait for you. - Thanks. If you've lost your marriage certificate, don't worry. Very broad-minded, this landlady. Mrs. Craney! Oh, Mrs. Craney! Well, what do you want? - Coming up with Romeo and Juliet. Customers. A couple of friends of mine from... - Where? - Richley, New York. - Richley, New York. Mr. And Mrs... - Wallace. - Mrs. Craney. - How do you do? I don't allow dogs, cooking or laundry in the bathtub. Anything else you want to do is all right. I'll be seeing you. Right this way. Now, this is one of my very nicest rooms, and I could let you have it for $9 a week. Well, you see, it isn't exactly what we're looking for. Well, of course, if you were able to pay me a week at a time in advance, I could do a little bit better by you. - Could you leave us alone for a minute? - Tommy, what's the use? Well, I'm sure I don't see what there is to talk about. My deluxe room and I'm offering it to you for $7 a week, and $7 a week is only 50 cents a day apiece. And she certainly looks worth it to me. Say, I've been thinking this over. You know, it's late and it's a tough night out, and we don't know where to look. But, Tommy, one room and one... Well, you can sleep here tonight and tomorrow night everything'll be all right. - But what about you tonight? - I'll find someplace. Well, it's all right, isn't it? Sure, I guess I could go along with you to see that you get along all right. I can take care of myself. I know that, but, darling, you're just not very lucky. Tommy, how much money have we got? We gotta be practical, you know. Let's see. There's 10, 15, 16, 17... $17.45. Well, then, that's $7 here and $2 for our marriage license, $9... That only leaves $8 to start life on. Do you wish you were home safe in Richley? No, but I don't want to start in by making things tougher than they have to be. Tommy, don't. We've got to tell the old lady what we're gonna do. If we don't call her in pretty soon, we'll have to pay rent. - I know what I'll do. - What? I'll sleep in the chair. Yeah, and by daylight you'd hate me because I was comfortable. Well? - Well? - We can only pay $6, that's all. $6? $6? 6... Well, of course, in these times, $6 is $6, isn't it? - Good night, children. - Good night. Good luck. Don't get worried. I'm gonna sleep in the chair. Yeah, you go to bed. I'll sing you to sleep. Good night. - Good night, baby. - Good night. Who's that knocking at my door? - I'm on my way, darling. - What's your hurry? Well, the man wants to give me a job and he says call before 9:00. J.P. Morgan wants to see me at 10:00, too. Don't forget, city hall at 12:00. Oh, we're gonna be married today, hurray - Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye. Good morning. I guess it's morning, all right, but it's not much good. You're just getting home? You wouldn't call this dump home, would you? I'm surprised you speak to me for bringing you here. Still in love this morning? Would you come to the city hall at 12:00 today? - Bridesmaid? - I don't know anybody else. Sure, baby, sure. I'm a sucker for fires and accidents. Oh, gee, thanks. Let me look at you. Seems to me, I remember once being just as silly as you look about somebody or something. Can't just remember. - 12:00. - Thanks. - Hello, bella. Just falling in? - A hard night at the office. All guys that sing in bathrooms should be shot in cold blood. Say, what did you do? Wake up lonesome? There you go, always belittling. Listen, Dolly, with a voice like that, he's sure to sit in his own lap. Not what you want on those long, cold sleeper jumps from Oregon and Montana. - Why, I'm an artist, I'll have you know. - You're telling me. Remember that handsome bellboy in Schenectady? I suppose you took him to Buffalo because he wanted to see Niagara Falls. No, that was a couple of other fellows. Excuse me, darling, but I've got to be a bridesmaid again, and at 12:00. Hey! Go into your dance and make it soft-shoe! I didn't know I was making so much noise. I'm sorry. Oh, don't apologize to me. I enjoyed it. Who yelled at me, then? Do I look as though I'd say anything as rude as that? No. No, indeed. - Were you waiting to get in here? - Mmm-mmm. I was waiting to get a look at you. Want to see if I look as bad as I sound, huh? - No. I'm Dolly Merrick. - Oh, yeah? Well, I'm Tommy Wallace, not that that cuts any ice. Oh, there's no ice around here. I got warm just listening to you. Now, I'm not trying to flirt with you. That's too bad. I'm taking a chance you might want a job as much as I want somebody like you to fill one. Job? - I was just going out looking for one. - You don't say. Now, you'd have gone around New York looking for me, and I'd have just pounded my heels down looking for somebody like you. We might have missed each other. Well, here we are. Yep, here we are. Just where are we? Well, I've been looking for a lad to sing in my act. - Act? - I told you, I'm Dolly Merrick. Say, listen, I just hit New York last night. I've been working seven years in a factory, on the level. I don't know what you're talking about. You wanna come in and sing that chorus for me again? - Want to get someone yelling at me again? - Let me worry about that. Relax, kid, relax. You don't have to be Caruso's ghost. Go ahead, nothing to it. I'm rooting for you. That's great. I've got to take the 10:00 train for Hartford. - 10:00? - And I've got to take a man with me. How would you like to go? Watch the matinee and try the evening performance. - I gotta get married at 12:00. - Well, you can't do both. That's a cinch. - Too bad. - You really mean... You mean, you'd take me? Listen, kid, what it takes, you've got, for my money. And how I need a job. I guess that's out. Who has the dough to get married on? The girl? No. No, she hasn't any money. I got about 7 bucks. Say, there ain't much sense to it, is there? Do as you like, but this is a tough town to get married in if you're busted. Plenty tough. - Someone in this job now? - Oh, don't. It makes me sick to think of him when I look at you. - Is it hard to do? - Oh, no. Sing a song in the box, then come down on the stage, take me in your arms and give me a big kiss. That doesn't sound like work. It sounds like a party. The guy doing it now reaches for me like a bull in a china shop. You know, nothing sweet or nice about it. - Can I try that, too? - I insist. Do you two girls want to get married? - Officer, how late do you stay open? - We close at 4:00. Opal, I'm scared. Listen, honey, there are 10 million people around this village. No taxicab is gonna pick Tommy out of 10 million and run over him. - But he's such a baby. - He's all right. Come on, simple. What did you... I've lost a good day's sleep. Wait till I get hold of that canary! No use being upset. Just explain to the bozo that it takes two people to get married. - You get some sleep. I'll wait for him. - The room has kind of an empty feeling. What's the matter? Everything's gone. Tommy's things, I mean. - Ran out, bag and baggage. - A telegram for Miss Sadie McKee. - Miss Sadie McKee. - That's her stage name. Nerts, says Mrs. Craney! "Job with Dolly Merrick. Will wire your fare home. " I guess you'd better go back home, kid. I can't go home. - What do you mean, you can't go home? - Not now. Gee, kid, what do you think you're doing? Making a sneak? Room rent, huh? Why do you keep things to yourself this way? Next, you'll be jumping off a dock and I'll get mad at you. I'm going to get you a job. - But, Opal... - No arguments. A silly job, but you can eat and pay Craney. - Feeling better? - Yes, thanks to you. You're going to find out about men. The tripe. No, thanks. Not interested. Swell. They come to my dump to get taken, see, and if you're smart... Am I talking loud enough? - I'm kind of sick of men. - Oh, you're crazy. They've got what we want, all of it, and every gal has her price. Yours ought to be high. Every gal has her price. I don't know what you got, but you sure gypped somebody. Hello, beautiful! How about a little souvenir? - Let go of that! Will you let go? - Come on, don't be like that. - What do you think this is, anyway? - I was just trying to be... Thanks. What do I want with a rose? You big mug! What happened to him? Say, did you see that pretty little girl? Tell that little girl I want to buy her a drink. - Yes, sir. - Bring her here. - Yes, sir. - And, hey... I wish they'd keep their filthy hands off me. Oh, you'll get used to it. Now, hurry up. Let's get home. Sadie! Sadie! You... You come along with me! - Oh, no, I'm going home. - No, Mr. Brennan wants you. I never heard of him. What does he want? - What does he want? - Maybe he wants a souvenir, too. Shut up, you dames. He's a rich millionaire, go ahead. Come along. Make him buy champagne. I'll give you 10. - See you when you get home, Sadie. - Okay. Mr. Brennan is in the... He'll come back. Just a moment. - This is Mr... Mr... - We've met. Sit down, Sadie. Sit down, Sadie. Where did you drop from, Sadie? - Are you kidding somebody? - No. Golly, I'm glad to see you. Where's this guy that sent for me? - Oh, you're dancing here? - Yeah. And if I wasn't afraid of losing my job, I'd... Why didn't you come to see me? What did you want? I wanted to send you both home. Give Tommy his job back. - A little late, I'll admit. - We won't talk about it. You know, your running away like that was a shock. I wanted to see you. I saw you for the first time in two or three years, I thought, "What a sweet, lovely girl. " I had a chance for a few words, and you're gone. A few words of yours is what did it. Well, I was right about Tommy. He proved it. - You trusted him and he let you down. - Nothing of the kind. He was afraid to take a chance getting married on nothing. He was just weak, got all turned around. That's what you did to me. Sadie, that's the alibi of a quitter. After all, nothing's happened to you that hasn't happened to millions of people. Millions? I wouldn't know that. It's happened to me, that's all I know. Sadie, if there's anything under the sun I despise, it's a person that quits the first crack they get. - It's a big world. There's lots of room... - Oh, cut it. Cut it! Big world? Well, I had a little world just my size, and you took it away. Now leave me alone, will you? Is this the girl? Is this the girl that gave me the rose? Hey, what are you doing with my girl? That's my girl. - What's your name? - Sadie McKee. What's yours? - Brennan. Hello, Sadie. - Hello. That's my lawyer. He's a nice fellow, but he's an old stick-in-the-mud. Sadie, will you have a drink? - Now, what shall it be, huh? - So your name is Sadie, huh? - Did you hear that, Michael? - Yes, I heard it. My grandmother's name was Sadie. Yeah? What'll Sadie have to drink? Pretty Sadie. You are a pretty little devil, you know. - What'll you have? - Ginger ale. Yeah, but what'll you have in it? - There's only one thing I really like. - Well, name it. So your name's Sadie? What do you like? I like champagne. - What's her split, Riccori? - Oh, shut up, will you, Mike? Supposing the girl does make $1 or so? - What does she get? - Oh, signor... Cut it out. Cut it out. - What does she get? - Well, I give her 10. Oh, swell. Champagne for everybody in the house. Signor! Jackass! Come on, let's get out of here. I want to get some sleep. Oh, keep quiet, will you? - How long you been working here? - About 10 days. - Listen, Sadie... - Will you let her alone? Where do you come from? I come from Richley, New York. - Where my mother's a cook. - Oh, did you hear what she said? Did you hear how she said it? Her mother is a cook. Oh, do I love you for that. You want to know something? My mother was a cook. - Yeah. - Yeah? You never knew that, did you? Yes, sir, my mother was a cook. Oh, Mr. Brennan, everybody is very, very happy. Look. - I take it all back. Thank you, Mr. Brennan. Here's to you, Sadie. It's a swell name. - You keep your head, do you, Sadie? - Yeah, I take a lesson from you. Michael puts it over the plate and she knocks it right out of the lot. Oh, Sadie. So your mother is a cook and your name is Sadie. Oh, that's wonderful. Mike, did I ever tell you that I had a grandmother who was a cook and her name was Sadie? Yeah, we got a lot in common, haven't we? Oh, so you're a cook and your mother's name is Sadie. Oh, that's wonderful. What's the matter? Don't you like it? I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll go up to my house where Sadie can have something she likes to drink. Don't be a chump. I'll take you home. I've got to get some sleep. Well, go ahead and get some sleep. I'm crazy about this girl. Her mother is a cook and her name is Sadie. - Come on, let's get out of this joint. - Who's telling Jack Brennan what to do? Sadie, will you take this and scram? You're a nice fellow, Michael, and I like you, but don't insult Sadie. Hey, Riccy, tell that band to come over here. We'll play some music, eh? What do you say? We'll have some music, huh, Sadie? How much money do you want to get out of here? I'm having a swell time. Jack, pull yourself together. Let's go home. I've got to work tomorrow. Oh, listen, I'm crazy about this girl. Now, let me alone. She's a great little girl. Yeah, and you're drunk and you don't know what you're talking about. Oh, now, stop your fighting. Let's everybody have a good time. Sit down and listen to the band. Go on, play something. You know, Old Pal. Old Pal? Old Pal, once over light, boys. Old Pal. Now play something hot. Oh, that was wonderful. Now play Old Pal. Sadie, you're a wonderful girl. You didn't go away. Come on, Sadie. Come home with me. - Sadie, you can't. - What do you say? - Do you know where he lives? - I'm about to find out. - Come on, Sadie. - Listen, you fool, all she has to do is get inside your house and she'll haul you into court and take a fortune away from you. I've met all the chiselers and the come-on girls, you can't fool me. Sadie's a great girl. Come on, Sadie. Listen, Sadie, whatever your little racket is, play for smaller game. This is my friend, you can't get away with anything. You cut me down once, Michael. It's harder to do now. For all my pals. Come on, Sadie. It's all right, Finnegan. I can walk tonight okay. You know, his name is Phelps so I call him Finnegan. He's a great guy, but Phelps is the wrong kind of a name for a guy like me, eh, Finnegan? Now, there's a living room upstairs and a living room downstairs. There's a den and a bar. Now, what'll you have, Sadie? - Let's go in the den. - Drinks in the den, Finnegan. - Yes, sir. - Jack, I'm going to give you just one drink, then I'll put you to bed and then I'll take Sadie home. Sadie is home. There's 28 rooms and 14 servants. That's a home, isn't it, Sadie? You turn on the radio and we'll have a little music, huh? All right. Wait, I'll turn it on. And now we'll have a little drink, huh? A welcome home for Sadie. Will you have a little dance? I must be drunk. A little rye, Phelps. I'm dead. Anything you want, Sadie, ask Finnegan for it. Anything. - You think I could have some coffee? - Certainly, miss. Fix a little drink for the lady. - She's ordered coffee, sir. - Oh, anything she likes. - Now don't go away, Sadie. - I won't. If you want anything, Finnegan will get it for you. - Won't you, Finnegan? - Yes, sir. A little rye, Sadie? Jack, will you drink that highball before you spill it? Oh. You know, I'm crazy about you, Sadie. You're a real down-in-the-earth girl. Yes, sir. And her name is Sadie. - Here, I'll take it. - No, you don't. I'm celebrating. Always said when the right girl came along, she wouldn't get away. - You can't get away, Sadie. - Tell her tomorrow. - I'm taking her home. - Don't leave me, Sadie. Don't ever leave me. - I'm waiting for my coffee. - You're waiting for a lot more than that. You're waiting for a whole lot more than that. You want to know something? Come here. We're gonna get married. Yes, sir, you and me are gonna get married. She's coming back with me if I have to carry her. She's gonna stay right here. This is just the kind of a kid I've been waiting for all my life. All my life, I've been waiting for a kid like... You aren't listening to this thing seriously, are you, Sadie? What business is it of yours? This man's weak. He's sick. He doesn't know what he's saying. All right. When he's sober, he'll forget about it. So what? - Supposing he doesn't? - Then I'll talk to myself about it, and to him, not to you. Listen, Sadie, haven't you any sense of sportsmanship? - Anything at all I can appeal to? - Not a thing on earth. You told me tonight to play for smaller game. Well, Tommy was small game. I knew it then as well as I know it now. But I've lost him, and nothing else makes any difference. He was a rat and a crook and he was guilty. That's got nothing to do with it. We were just little people asking for help, and you weren't human enough to give it to us. But, Sadie, this is a good egg. He never hurt anybody. It's shooting birds on the ground to take advantage of him. Yeah? When an Alderson kicks helpless people in the gutter, that ain't shooting birds on the ground. Oh, no. Your coffee, miss. Finnegan, fix me a little drink, will you? Don't you want a little drink, Sadie? I got mine. Gee, you're a great girl. Don't you think so, Mike? Oh, I forgot. You don't think so. Finnegan, hurry up with my drink. Always Johnny-on-the-spot. My, am I thirsty. Listen, Jack, are you gonna let this little chiseler marry you for your money? Why, you... If I wasn't so tired, I'd bust you one. I'd bust you right in the nose. Now, wait a minute. Lie there and get some sleep. - I'll sit here and watch you. - Gee, you're a great girl, Sadie. - Is your mother alive? - Yeah. Oh, that's fine. I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll send her a little present, huh? Anything you like. We'll send her a season pass to the Yankee Stadium, huh? Yes... You couldn't think of marrying that man for anything but his money. Sure, every gal has her price. And mine's high. Beautiful. It's too bad she has so shabby a bridesmaid. It's a shame she has so shabby a bridesmaid. Oh. Mr. Brennan. Okay. Goodbye. - Oh, madam. - What? I am so sorry. It's all right. Keep it on. - Well, I am that embarrassed. - Oh, yeah? Come on. Goodbye. Where is everybody? Where is the committee of welcome? Oh, Finnegan! Oh, always Johnny-on-the-spot. - Good evening, Mr. Finnegan. - Good morning, madam. Morning? Wait till I look at my new watch. - Isn't that pretty? - Yes, indeed, madam. Oh, excuse me. Good morning, Mr. Finnegan. - Just Finnegan. - Just Finnegan? Good morning, just Finnegan. Finnegan, get all the servants together. I want them to meet Mrs. Brennan. Oh, no, I don't feel sociable. I'm tired. - Can I get you a little supper, madam? - No, thanks. We drank our little supper. - We drank our supper. - Come on. Do you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna trade this house in for a house with elevators. Three elevators. One for you, one for me, one for Finnegan. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Say, what's today? What day is it today? - Thursday, sir. - Thursday? When were we married? - Wednesday. Oh, Finnegan. Wednesday was the happiest day of my life. - Congratulations, sir. - That's very sweet of you. Come on. Here we go. Come on. - Finnegan, you mix us a little drink, huh? - Yes, sir. And we'll have a little celebration. And, Finnegan, you show Mrs. Brennan the next room. Very good, sir. Don't you feel good? - Excuse me a moment, please. - Sure. He can't take it, can he? Finnegan. Finnegan, I want you to tell me something. Tell me, do you think I'm a little drunk? What do you think, madam? Well, don't get sore about it, I just want to know 'cause... 'Cause I've never been before, and... Maybe I am. I don't know. You hurt yourself? My foot slipped. My foot often slips. Put him to bed, Finnegan. He's tired. - Yes, madam. - Attagirl. Yeah, that's what's the matter with me. I'm tired. I guess it's the excitement of getting married, huh? Finnegan, did you get a good look at her? Isn't she wonderful? Yes, sir, quite wonderful. Jack, do you mind if I wander around and look at our house? This is gonna be a personally conducted tour. All right. I can't make it. I can't make it. You get some sleep so we can celebrate some more. We'll celebrate all our lives. Nothing but celebrate. I'm going to look at the rest of the house and get acquainted with the rest of my servants. Right. Sadie. You know the first thing I'm gonna do? Trust fund for your mother. $50,000. Make it $100,000. Anything you like. How's that? Thanks. Is Mrs. Brennan home? Are you the young lady she's expecting? - Well, she's expecting me. - Will you come in, please? Here it is. Lady, when you say, "I do take thee," how you take them. Got this all to yourself? Yep, all to myself. - Always all to yourself? - Yep. Well, a whole lot of us do a whole lot more for a whole lot less. Come on, take your hat off. Swell! Everybody can clean up at the same time. We got a dozen of them in this house. - Sadie McKee, you're a liar. - No, truly, over a dozen. - Could I bring Mrs. Craney up sometime? - Sure. Come on, show you a lot more. Say, what are you doing with these? Keeping track of Tommy? Listen, are you going to be nuts about that canary all your life? - I'm afraid so. - Well, control yourself. Because you've got everything. Everything. Henry Ford coming to tea? You wait here. Where's the fire, huh? So I've got everything, huh? I'll take it. - Let go of me. - Okay, sir. Okay, I have enough people in the world who make Jack Brennan do what he doesn't want to do. - Take it easy, now. - What's the matter? Is he hurt? - Oh, hello, Sadie. - Hello. Sadie, make these fellows let go of me, will you? This is the best friend I have. She never bothers me. Sadie, tell them to mind their own business, will you? Come on, put him on the couch. All right, big boy, everything is going to be all right. Nothing to worry about. - You're home and I'm here. - Yeah, that's all right, but I don't want those guys pushing me around, that's all. - I know. I know. - I'll do anything you want me to do, but... - All right, dear. - I don't want to be pushed around. Now, lie there. What time did he leave the house tonight, Phelps? - Shortly after midnight, madam. - Where'd you find him? In a dump on 9th Avenue. He was breaking things. Pretty wild. Much obliged. That's all right, ma'am. We take care of him. There ain't a cop in the Roaring Forties that don't know Jack Brennan. Sad, but true. Oh, wait a minute. - There you are. That's all right. - Thanks. Give it to him. He's got a wife and two sick kids. His mother's sick, too, ma'am. - And how's your old man? - He's dead. Gee, thanks, lady. Thanks. Thanks a lot, boys. Sorry to have caused you so much trouble. It's no trouble at all. - I appreciate it very much. - No, it's all right. - It's no trouble at all. - Thanks again, boys. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hey, you! Where're you going? - Wait! Wait a minute. What are you doing there? Oh, just practicing. This is a funny place to practice. Well, you gotta practice someplace. Come on, professor. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Competition's too strong for me. You better give him the spot. Help him out, professor. - Good evening, Phelps. - Good evening, madam. - Hello, Dr. Branch. - Mrs. Brennan. - Your husband's a sick man, Sadie. - Some more of the same thing? Really bad shape. I suggest the hospital. As bad as that? The doctor says he can't live six months at the rate he's going. But he's been in the hospital before and it didn't seem to do any good. Well, what else would you suggest? - What chance has he? - Only one. Quit drinking. I'd like a little time to think it over. The hospital, I mean. I don't know very much about it. Madam, a Mr. Tommy Wallace is asking for you on the telephone. Tommy Wallace? Excuse me, please. She'd let him walk right into his grave, and she'd walk into about $11 million. Well, there's nothing much you can do about it. I've got a feeling like... Murder in the air. Hello, Tommy? Sadie, when I saw you this afternoon, my heart stopped. Yes, I know. I felt the same way. Only that was this afternoon. I've got a job on my hands now that I've got to do. Listen, Sadie, I know I haven't any right to ask, but there's things I gotta say to you, kid. I wanna see you. - I gotta see you. - I'm sorry, but it's impossible. I can't, Tommy. Goodbye. Good luck and God bless you. - I'll call you, Doctor. - All right. - He'll sleep a couple of hours. - Thanks. Michael, I'd like to talk to you. - Dinner is served, madam. - Just a moment. - Will you stay to dinner? - Yes, I'd like to talk to you, too. I'll see you later, Doctor. - Good night. - Good night. This is nice and friendly, isn't it? - What's so funny? - Everything. My mother dreamed that I'd grow up so beautiful that you'd go simply mad about me. She dreamed that we'd be sitting like this in a grand house. Here we are, Michael. Sadie, I've known you a long while. - You used to like me, didn't you? - A lot. A whole lot. - Why not go back to being a sweet girl? - What do you want me to do? It's awfully hard to say unless I say it plainly. All right, go ahead. Well, this marriage, the way it happened, it doesn't give you the same rights, in my mind, as if it'd been a different kind of marriage. Drunk or sober, Jack's been good to me. I can't forget that. - You've been seeing Tommy haven't you? - I saw him this afternoon. And yesterday and the day before. - No, just this afternoon. - Sadie, why don't you get out of this? - I mean it. - Get out? I can guarantee you a generous settlement. All the money you'll ever need. Michael, my husband's in trouble. And I want to put him someplace where he'll have a chance for his life. He's been in all the places, hasn't he? You've figured out all the angles on this, haven't you? Maybe you've been expecting it. Michael, were you ever in love with anybody for a minute? - Apropos of what? - You learn more about people. As far as you're concerned, I look at the evidence. You ran away with a good-for-nothing rat, and because he let you down, you jump at the same cheap conclusions that all cheap people do. - That's the evidence. - All right. All right. But we're not talking about yesterday or the day before. Listen, Sadie, take it from me. Money isn't worth it. There isn't enough in the world if you let this man die, and do nothing about it. Jack doesn't feel that way. He likes me and he trusts me because he knows he can. That's why I wanted to talk to you. He's been so good to me. If he'd let anyone save him, he'd let me. I want you to help me, Michael. Help me to do it my way. Help you to do what? You know absolutely nothing about it. I know that. But if I give him to you and he dies, that's cowardly and I won't do that. - I'm gonna change doctors, Michael. - You're going to do what? Isn't there any use talking to you? He already has a doctor that understands him and has taken care of him. Yeah, and that'll go on taking care of him until he dies. I'm going to do this job alone. I don't know how, but now I don't care what you think about it. That's twice you could have helped me, Michael, and twice you fell flat on me. Sadie, I want to warn you, an alibi won't be enough this time. I know what's at the bottom of this. It's a nice, safe way for you to gather in a fortune that you and Tommy are going to spend. You can't fool me. But there are laws in this country, and I know something about them. If you do this monstrous thing, your life won't be worth living. No matter where you are, no matter what you get out of it. I'll see to that. I'll hound you through every court in the land for deliberate murder. - So help me. - I don't care what you do or what you think. If I'm taking chances, okay, I'll take them. I'm his friend. I'll prove that. Now, this is my house and you're not welcome. Oh, Finnegan! - What's the matter, dear? - What's the matter? Nothing, I feel great. Come on in here, Finnegan! - What do you think you're gonna do? - We'll go places, eh, Finnegan? Jack, don't be crazy. You can't go anyplace. We'll show them, won't we, Finnegan, huh? Listen, you're sick and it's dangerous for you to get up. I want to see the lights and hear the music. Don't we, Finnegan? Oh, Mr. Finnegan, got whiskers on his chin again. Jack, you're not gonna leave this house. So that's the answer, is it? Get out of here before I smash this bottle on that ugly, sneaking face of yours. Get out! Put that down. You're through. Fired, right now. Get out of this house as fast as you can. - That's not Mr. Brennan's orders. - It happens to be mine. Get out of here! She's just discharged me, Mr. Alderson. There's no knowing what she'll do if she gets things into her own hands here. Thank you, sir. Do you want me to wait until you get here? Very good, sir. He'll stop her. He won't let that little tramp get away with murder. I thought I told you to pack and get out of here. Oh, so that's it, huh? All right, you're all fired right here and right now. Every one of you. Bag and baggage. I was hired by Mr. Brennan. He'll have to tell me himself if I'm fired. What have I done? Yes, what have we done? - We haven't done anything. - Shut up! You don't get me, do you? I'm firing you. Throwing you out. Now, beat it. But, madam... We didn't understand. Finnegan! I'll show you. Making Jack Brennan a prisoner. My job is to keep him alive, so that I don't get $11 million that don't belong to me, and that I don't want. If I fall down on my job, I don't even get a reference. I'll make a bargain with you. You can keep your jobs if you help me keep mine. - We're with you. - All right, I'll stay. Not another drop of liquor to Mr. Brennan, so help you God. - So help me God. - So help me God. That goes for all of you. I don't know how you feel about this, Phelps. I feel very ashamed, madam. I shall be proud to work for you, if you'll allow me to remain. Thank you, Phelps. Finnegan! Somebody! Finnegan! Oh, there you are. You can't do this to me. We're gonna settle this meddling business right now. All right. All right, dear, I'm sorry. Now, please go back to bed. I can't get what I want in my own house, I'm going to get out. - Jack, you can't. - Oh, yeah? - Please don't. I'm fighting for your life. - Will you get a load of Jack Brennan having to fight his way out of his own house? - Jack, you can't go. I won't let you. - Oh, is that so? Well, I'll show you. Then you can pack your things and go back to where I picked you up. Jack, can't I get it into your head that I'm trying to help you? You're sick and if you go out now, anything might happen. You might even kill your... Here's to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. - Leg broken? - Yes, broken. Bad break. I'm afraid he won't move for a good many weeks. What a break for us. Oh, Signor Brennan, this is good. This is very good. Us small boys only drank because we had prohibition. - Are you sailing for Europe tomorrow? - Tomorrow. Now, what's the use to go to Europe if you don't drink champagne? Give us a toast. - Well, what'll he drink it in? - Ginger ale. Honest, Mr. Brennan, are you being a strong character or don't you want it? No, I just don't want it. - Here's to Sadie. - She ruined my best customer. Here's to you, Sadie. - Thanks. - Do you wanna dance, Sadie? - No thanks. Come on, bury the hatchet. Let's be happy. - I can't be happy till she's forgiven me. - That's asking a lot, isn't it? We ask big things of big people. - Meaning me? - Meaning you. Meaning you. I'll say so. Wait a minute. What are you doing there? - I'm just practicing. This is a funny place to practice. Well, I gotta practice somewhere. Come on, girls. Competition's too strong for me. You better give him the spot. Golly. I suppose you've come to thank me for getting that sap Tommy out of your way and giving you a chance to go after the big time. - Where is he? - Where is who? Tommy. I haven't the faintest notion. What do you care? Is he in New York? - I dropped him in New Orleans. - How long ago? Oh, about three or four months ago. I don't know. He may still be there. Did he have any money? I don't know. He was three weeks salary ahead of me when I dumped him. - Why did you dump him? - Personal reasons. Ever since we left New York, he's been going around in a fog. Couldn't get him to bed, took a derrick to get him up. No ambition. He got a cold in Vancouver, still had it in Kansas City and couldn't sing, so I... - Look here. - Yes, I still love him. I'm not gonna try and tell you much about that, except this. Instead of thanking you, I could kill you and love it. You can cut that. You grabbed yourself a millionaire pretty pronto, didn't you? Yes, and I'd give every penny of every million to be back at Mrs. Craney's before you pulled your cheap little bag of tricks. Where do you get that stuff? I do as I like because I like it, but I never sold myself for money. Shut up! Well, you... Dolly, honey, you better hurry. You're on in... Oh, darling. Did you tell that gal her right name? - Sorry, dear. - Sorry for what? - Will you have a little champagne? - No, thanks. Do you want to tell Papa your troubles? Jack, I'm going to fall down on you because I'm a fool. - You're the only girl in the world. - That makes it harder to say. I can't go to Europe with you. What happened tonight, it's something I never told you. There was no reason for it. I thought it was dead. - Somebody you love? - I can't help that, can I? Any more than you can help loving me. I fell in love with him when I was 17, with all my heart. Everything. We were gonna be married. This girl, Dolly Merrick... Oh, Jack, please try to understand. I married you because I was knocked silly and it was a refuge. I found out tonight that this boy's in trouble. Maybe alone. It's blinding me. I can't think of anything else. If I went on with you, you'd soon hate me. Jack, there's only one man in my heart, and I've got to find him. I don't know why that's so, but... That's the way it is. I don't know how to say it. My dear, you said it straight as you always do. - I'll call you in the morning. Right. It's awful hurting you this way. Sadie, one can't buy love. That's about the only chance I'd have. - Jack, I do love you. - Yes, I know. You've given me my life, and if there's anything in the world that you want, I'll help you get it. Stick to your guns about this, will you? Right. I'll arrange with Michael about the divorce. - Jack, I just wanted you to understand. - I do understand. Take me home, will you? There's so much I want to tell you. Let's have one dance. After all, we're saying goodbye here. Right here, where we started. What do you say? All right. I don't like that cough very much. I guess you like it as well as I do. How are you, Tommy? Well, fancy seeing you here. - What'll you have? - Nothing, thanks. Sadie wants to know how you are, Tommy. How you're getting along. - She send you? - Not exactly. - Well, I don't want any part of it. - Never mind that. How you and I feel about each other has nothing to do with this. Well, you tell Sadie I'm okay. I'm not doing as well as she is, but okay. How long has this been going on? Listen, buddy, what do you want? What is all this? Come on, let's have it. Did you ever make a bad mistake you'd give your whole life to fix up? - Yeah. - I'm speaking for myself. I did a lot of damage, Tommy. Now give me a chance. I want to do what I can. Listen, you had me pegged right in Richley. I was guilty. No, that's got nothing to do with it. You see, Sadie is still in love with you. She's clearing the decks. I'll tell you all about it. It's too late. I'm shot, brother. - This could be fixed, this cough business. - Oh, yeah? You don't want Sadie to find you like this. And she's going to find you. - Anything new? - About the same. - This is a slow business. - Hey, it speeds up for the exit, doesn't it? - Exit? - I know, Doc. I heard the consultation. I was playing possum. - Kind of caved in last night, didn't I? - You've been asking for Mrs. Brennan. - Is she here? - Mmm-hmm. Do me a favor, will you, Doc? - Don't tell her. - No. - No, of course not. - On the level, Doc. Don't tell her. Dr. Briggs. Mrs. Brennan, Dr. Briggs. - How do you do? - How do you do? Did you warn her about excitement being bad? We haven't been able to fool this young woman. Why, I wouldn't say we told her. Instinct, I guess. - He was improving until last night. - And now? Well, that's hard to say. He made me promise we wouldn't tell her. All right, Doctor. - Mrs. Brennan, you won't... - Of course not. I'm all right now. Hi, Tommy. Hi, Sadie. - How are you? - Swell. Come here. You'll have to come all the way. I'm not allowed to move. Holy smoke, Sadie. I came as soon as I knew you were here. I had it all figured out, what I was going to say to you. - Now I can't think of a blooming word. - Tommy, you don't have to say anything. I'll just sit here. Now, don't you go and get worried. I'm okay. Yeah, so they tell me. You know, Sadie, you're even prettier than you used to be. Am I? Yes, sir, you sure are. I took care of myself for you, Tommy. I knew we hadn't lost each other. Will you give me another chance? Anything in the world you want, you know that. Sadie, you know why I'm kind of tongue-tied? Tommy, if you're gonna worry about the least little thing now, I'll have to go. Oh, now, look here. I feel swell. They got me down, but that's nothing. I'm all right. But you mustn't dig up things except the good ones. - I never stopped being crazy 'bout you. - I know that. I've been lying here thinking about you every second I'm awake. - Darling... - Don't shut me up. All right, dear, only don't worry 'bout it. I should say not. You're gonna give me another chance? I knew you would. I always did. Once I started, once I messed things up, I couldn't get right again, and then... You remember that time I saw you in the theater? Yeah, I was through after that, no fooling. I used to go to bed and get to thinking so hard in the dark, get so sick about it, I'd get up again and go out someplace and get drunk. - Tommy, please... - No, I gotta tell you. I want you to know. You don't have to say it, darling. I know all about it. Say, I'll sing you a song again - when the robins come home. - Sure you will. I don't know where Michael got all these doctors, but they sure are great. Michael? - Haven't you seen him? - Yes, I saw him. Didn't he tell you? That's the funny thing about that guy. You know, he is just as swell a bird as he ever thought he was. Tommy, I'll have to go. You've had enough. I'll sing you a song again when the robins come home. Yes, sirree. Tommy, darling, I can't pretend any longer. I know I shouldn't break up this way, but just seeing you like this and... I'll get hold of myself in a minute, darling. It doesn't mean anything, honest. I'm sorry. It's just that it was all tied up inside and had to come out, I guess. Tommy. Tommy, dear. You know, there are a lot of people in New York who'd buy seats to watch me do this. Say, tell Sadie I really did some of that, will you? - How do you like it here in the big city? - Oh, I love it. Four months. It seems like four days. Doesn't it go fast? This is the first real birthday party I've ever had in New York. Tell me something, will you? Am I coming here too often? - Hello, everybody. - That man's in again. - And welcome, too. - How's the honest working girl? - Swell. Many happy returns. - Thanks. - Look at that. - Gee, Mom, it's grand. Now, you two sit right down. Me and the hired girl will bring in the dinner. All right. You three girls are pretty snug here, aren't you? It's a lot of fun. If I ever get to be a nuisance... Michael, you're much too good a friend to ever be anything like that. I'll take those kind words for a birthday present. All my waking hours are going to be spent trying to think of something I can do for you. So if you can't take a lot of it, don't encourage me. Now, make a wish. You have to blow them all out or your wish won't come true. English - SDH
