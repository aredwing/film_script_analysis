And Mr. Pim, the grocer he says that you shop once a week and not till late at night. Now, I can understand. You don't want your friends to see you perhaps not as you once were. But if you came in for your therapy you would improve. and so would your spirits. I can arrange to have a physical therapist come here three times a week. Hm? Would you like that? Of course, it's going to be more expensive than at the hospital. What else... What else do I have to spend my... my money on? Ah, son of a bitch! It stinks! Let's keep our voices down.

Let me help you, sweetheart. Get away. Are you OK? Give me your hand? Oh, don't be like that... for God's sake. Are you worried I might be catchy? Or you might suffer from a severe jewelry rash?

Michelle Pfeiffer goes after a dangerous mind. I know you're in there. You paid for the lesson. You might as well get it. Come on. Open the door. Walt, I want you, baby! Oh, Walt, please be my man! Oh, please put it inside of me! Break it off in me, daddy. Break it off in me. What the fuck's the matter with you? OK, OK. What the fuck you doin'? All right, we had a few words.

I told your doctor it would never work. - You. You talked to D-Dr. Nirmala? - Yeah. Nirmala? Yeah. She's a fine woman. She helped a friend of mine who died of Al DS. Miss Burma. And also, if I was gonna teach you, I wanted to make sure I was doing it right. Like Anne Bancroft, you know. The Miracle Worker. I don't need no fag with a heart of gold. Honey, you see a crown of thorns on my head? Only rhinestones, sweetheart. I am no Brother Teresa. I told you, I need the money. I got big plans. Oh! Got a letter from Ed Koch. Ah, when New York was fun. Oh! You're a bowler. That's so cute. Third place. Pretty good. Oh, I always heard you were some kind of hero. Yeah. Look where it got me. Oh, hey. You know? You got a rough break. Who did n't? Look, I see you sittin' there all alone you know, all the time. Hidin' from life, you know? Life. Life is shit. Aren't you just a little ray of sunshine? Allow me to leave you sitting all alone on your pity pot, cos I've been there before. Poor me, poor me pour me another, all right? OK. Oh, honey, are you coming upstairs? You know, to face the music like the man you're supposed to be? Or should I just get Dr Kevorkian's fucking phone number for you? Your favourite note. Oh, that was so adorable. All right, play that funky music, white boy! OK. I think you're doing pretty good with the scales. We need to start workin' on a song, OK? All right. Oh, listen. Everything's Coming Up Roses? Peppy, positive, Sondheim. No? OK, OK. Moving right along. Probably you 're into Sinatra. Although I don't do Sinatra. Although I'm sure I'm the only girl who hasn't. I... I like the tango. So... you're a tango dancer? Are you? Was. Was. Yeah. You will be again, though. I know I know a song you'd probably love. All right, hold on. It's right here. Sorry, girl. We didn't know you was entertaining. We're going downstairs for some pizza. We were gonna go watch Carmine twirl that pizza dough with his big muscles. - You wanna come with us? - Ladies. This is Walt from downstairs. He's taking singing lessons, all right? Well, Mary, I just wanna find out about my blue dress. I'm sorry. This will only take one minute. You better watch out for Rusty, honey. She likes you "straight" guys. Miss Thing, shove a land mine in that big hole you call a mouth. How you doin', baby? My name is Cha Cha de los Santos Prez Cueva. You can just call me Cha-Cha. Oh, I'm sorry. You have a My Left Foot thing going on, don't you? All right, out, out, out! Out! I think we got the message! Come on! Yoo-hoo, Miss Taco Bell. Vmonos. Vmonos. - Bye, Mr. My Left Foot. - Vmonos. Vmonos. All right, I'll take a Mido! Miss you already! Sorry about that. They are so much work. All right. Is this the real you or what? Give me some men who are stout hearted men Who will fight for the right they adore Ooh, macho man! The macho man! I kill bear! Shit in woods! Am I right? You'll love it, honey. All right. Now, we can start with. From the top of that song I thought would be really good. How long you been doing this? Singing? No, no. This drag queen type of thing. Well, I've been in musicals at school, ever since I was a little kid. You know, I was Prince Chulalongkorn in The King And I. Bu t I was miscast Then I was the lion in The Wizard of Oz and I was definitely miscast but I was the only one... fat enough to fit into the costume. Whatever. And then in The Snow Queen I was again totally miscast as the king. We were all on stage and they had made these dry ice kettles so smoke could come out of 'em. And one night, all of a sudden one dry ice kettle exploded and dry ice flew everywhere. Well, pretty little Miss No Talent who was playing the snow queen dashed off the stage screaming and pulling her hair out. Well, the play must go on, I believe and she had dropped her crown. Well, honey, I just picked up that crown put it on my head and I was the greatest goddamn snow queen In the history o f PS 11 Paramus, New Jersey. And I have been wearing dresses ever since. Bu t I don't like the term "drag queen", you know? Because most drag queens just wanna parade around looking lawless. and if they sing they lip synch to records and... I'm a singer... and I'm a female impressionist. I'm an artist, you know? Who do you think you're bull... bullshitting? You 're a fuckin' drag queen! Let me savour those lovely words for a moment, all right? What are you, channelling Jesse Helms? Don't be so... so sensitive. You. You can take a dick. you can take an insult. Right, Walt. I'm not so... stupid as you think. Honey, you could never be as stupid as I think you are, all right? Yes? I owe you two weeks, right? Yes And there's a week in advance. I'm getting a motorcycle. Can I park it in the back so it's safe? A motorcycle. It's $50 additional every week for parking. $50? No problem. Take it easy. Would you like a receipt for that? No, I trust you. Why don't you lighten up a little bit, Leonard? - Cone on, Tasha. - Bye Have a nice evening. Don't push me! Don't push me! Please don't push me! Just go! Don't call my fuckin' house! Jesus! Wait! Wait! No, wait! Look, Im sorry! Please stay! Please! - We're gonna start with "Shirley, Shirley". - Last night. - What, honey? - Your boyfriend? Yeah. It's complicated. He's married. He has two kids. But the fucking gambles you know? On sports. He always needs money for new storm windows or something for his kids so he says, but it's for gambling and I know. He gambles with your money? Yeah, the gambles with my money So you pay... for sex? Honey, there's no romance without finance, you know? Oh, no. I don't pay for sex. No? No. Well... What, you think if you got a wifey or a girlfriend, you don't pay, honey? Honey, you pay, all right? You ever been married? Don't answer that. She probably died of some horrible disease and it's made you what you are. Well, she was a... a dancer. I worshipped her. She ran... ran off with some guy who... gave her a... a tattoo. Took everything. Everything. The dog. Everything. Honey, you should have gotten another dog. All right. All right, slowly now. Oh, Christ. I'm sorry. Just Shirley, Shirley. Just practise it. OK, OK! OK! Stop ringing. What? What? When? Hold on, hold on. We're gonna have to stop for today, sweetheart. I'm sorry. I just have to stop. Hello? Hello? Who is this? Walt. Walt. Is there anything you need? To tell you the truth, I was... I... I was hoping later we would get together. Sure. You're a godsend. Because Im. having trouble with my rent... again this month. To tell you the truth, I'm... I'm kind of tapped out. I don't have any money except for the... the therapy. I see. But we could still... still get together. Oh, sure. How about some... some time next... next week? Listen, Im gong to be tied up for the next couple of weeks. But I'll call you. I gotta go. OK. Bye. - Bye, sweetheart. I'll call you. Bye. - Sure. OK Bye. Don't go, cos she ain't interested in you or what picture you wanna see. Mr. Pogo has returned. Where you going? I haven't finished my story. Nice wheels. Thanks, man. - Yeah, it must have cost you. - Yeah. Where'd you get the money? Hey? - What the fu ck? - You been lashin' around a lotta cash. Where'd you get it? Some guy owed me money. Big deal. What fuckin' guy? What guy? Look, fuck this shit. Tasha, we gotta get out of here. Aw, shit! I'm fuckin' the bitch. I'll tell you. Don't hurt the bike. I been dealing. Dealing? For who, motherfucker? Radio. For that fat fuck? In Mr. Z's territory? Fucker! Oh, shit! You deal around here again you're fuckin' dead! You never said nothin' about dealin' drugs! Prick! Tasha. I really thought you were the one. You just treated me like scum. And you left me like a tornado leaves a town. I gave you love. I gave you gifts. Bu t you treated me like shit. And you fuckin' kicked me when I was down. You fuckin' kicked me when I was down. So no more excuses. When I call, youse answer the phone. Cos I know you talked to Karen. She told you? No. Tia. The young one in the dance club who had eyes for you? Tia's a whore, Tommy. They're all whores. Except my mother, may she rest in peace. Hey, watch it. Hey, and your mother too... What's your name again? - LeShaun. - LeShaun. Right. Anyways, tomorrow's Saturday and the card game's at Vinnie's. The guys would sure love it if you would drop by, like old times. Maybe. Yeah, sure. And black is beautiful. Man, watch your mouth, all right? Fat boy Fat boy? Oh, you motherfucker! Now, watch it... You wanna come over here and watch? Don't be mad at me just cos you look like Pillsbury Doughboy. I am somebody. Oh, no. Hold on. Hand me the paddle, man. Get that fuckin' paddle before... Watch out... Hey, come on! I said it to you on purpose! I know, you came from kings. I saw Roots. All 20 nights of it. Hey, you're making me miss 'em, Tommy. Come on! I got it. There we go. Hey. Is Walt there? Yeah, he's here. Thanks. Don't cry for me, Argentina. What do you think, M r My Le ft Foot? You know, for the Flawless contest? I don't know. Oh, your brain's still broke, huh? Well, that's OK. Have you seen Miss Rusty? Cos she was supposed to help me with this. No, I haven't seen him. OK. Thank you. - Bye, baby. - Bye. Bye, big boy He gone? Huh? I don't wanna hear one fuckin' word from either one of you. OK... baby. OK, baby. Oh, my God. I'm so glad I lived long enough to see that. Baby! Get up, girl. Like Lana Turner in Ziegfeld Girl. Oh, honey. Oh, honey. Hi. Are you all right? Oh, peachy, honey. Where the hell you been? Oh, fun and games. My mothers funeral and wake. Oh. Sorry to hear about your mother. Oh, my father killed her a long time ago. Buried her today, that's all. This is my legacy... Her old gloves. She always wore gloves. Yeah, she was a victim, you know? But she was sweet you know, but a victim. A reformed drunk... on her knees at church, begging you know, Jesus, Mary and Joseph and every goddamn saint in heaven to forgive her for giving birth to Cruella de Fag, you know? Being a slave to my father before he died. You would have loved each other. He... He thought Archie Bunker was a flaming liberal. You know, every morning she would get up and fix him breakfast. And... every morning, for 30 years she said Hi, Daddy. Do you love me? No answer. Every morning, 30 years. Hi, Daddy. Do you love me? No answer. One day, my ma says Hi, Daddy. Do you love me? And... he said no. The moral of that story is so... If you haven't gotten an answer in 30 years, you ought to know it by now. Thanks for the drink. You're welcome. See you tomorrow. Thank you for staying. Sorry about your mother. Thanks. You 're right, Walt. Honey, I just want you to know that you're right. You know, Im I'm not an artist, you know. I'm not some... female impressionist. I'm a... I'm lonely... and I'm ugly... and I'm a drag queen. Now look who's feeling sorry for themselves. Where have you been? Sonny, don't. You says if I come here last night you'll have the fuckin' money Not now! I didn't have the money! I was somewhere else! Where's the fuckin' money? Come on, man. Take it easy. Who the fuck is this? - Let go! I'll get the money. - Get my money. Let go of him. I'll give you the money. Walt, just get in the room. He's not gonna let you go. Just walk in the room. I'm tired of coming here for nothing. Five minutes. OK? If you fuck around, I'm telling you I'm gonna fuckin' smack you. You look really good today, all right? All right, honey. Fuck you, you cocksucker! Don't you fuckin' lock this door! Motherfucker! Don't you lock that door! No! Not the fuckin' door again! Rusty! You wanna fuck around let's fuck around. Open the fuckin' door! I need that money, man! Steel plate. Don't worry. I don't know if I did it to keep out burglars or Sonny when he gets like this. Go home and beat up wifey before I call the cops, you fucker! All right, fuck you! You just fucked up. I'm comin' back every fuckin' night. You don't pay me, I'll take a fuckin' scissor to every fuckin' wig you got here! Motherfucker! So that's your... your boyfriend? He's not always like this. He's got this Italian Catholic guilt and shame thing because he loves me so much. We're... we're working it out. This won't happen once I have... my operation to be all woman, you know? That's why I work teaching and sewing saving up for the day that I... become a real woman. You 're gonna become one of those he-she freaks? All she. After the... hormone shots and the operation. You're gonna cut off your dick and balls? Snip, snip, sweetheart. How could a man cut off his dick and balls? Why would you do that? Because I'm a woman trapped in a man's body, honey. You 're no woman. I'm just not your idea of a woman, Walt. You 're nobody's idea of a woman. I'm my idea. Maybe I can under understand if if you wanted to be a woman, but... I don't understand a man wanting to be an ugly woman. Open up! We ain't got all day! Come on! Walt! We didn't think you would come to Vinnie's house so we brought the party to you! - We missed you. - Let's go! Let's go! Hey, you guys. Is Waldo back here or what? Waldo Koontz is back. The man's a true hero. I'll never forget that day in that bank 14 years ago. I heard it 43 times. I heard it. I don't wanna hear it again. All right, I won't say it! Whatever happened to the other guy? You know, the other guard, Joe? Is he retired? No, no. He got a great job in Southeast Asia, something like that. He was a smart guy. Right. Walt. I hear you're thick with the she he's... or should I say long and thick? I'm taking speech therapy cos it's in the building. It's in the building, fuckhead! Yeah, Mike. And he's doing great. He is. I never thought I'd see Walt The Wall Koontz hangin' out with drag queens. Will you shut the fuck up? It's better than lookin' at you. I'll get it. - Paulle, are you out? - Yes, Im out. It's you and I, Vinnie. Are we playing cards? We're out, huh? Fellas, you remember Tia from the dance club? Walt, you remember Tia, right? Jesus, you know what? We should go. Look at the time.

We've been discussing this year's Gay Pride parade. And we felt that it would be important... well, a good idea, to show a united front. Synthesis, I believe. Right. Synthesis! We felt, as gay Republicans we thought it would be a really good idea if we could all come together and show the world our likenesses not our differences. To celebrate the... Synthesis. Right, synthesis. Synthesis. You 're very good You a re Sorry, go ahead. We... We could march together as a united brotherhood. What about the sisterhood? We march on foot. No floats. You think if you have no loats we won't do drag cos we can't march in heels. Well, let me tell you something, honey. We can march to Lake Titicaca and back in stilettos. So don't. Hey, let's just calm down, men. Aren't you guys the same group that raised a shitload of money for Bob Dole's campaign, and he sent it back? He would have lost support of the Christian Right... Exactly. Cos you're gay. You 're gay, so he sent it back. Aren't you ashamed? You are right. We are different... but not in the way that you mean. We're different because you are ashamed of us, and we are not ashamed of you. As long as you get down on those Banana Republican knees and suck dick, honey you're all my sisters. And I love you. I do. God bless you... and fuck off. Ma? Ma? Ma? Oh, my... Oh, my God. Jacko... Jacko. Mr. Z I didn't expect Where's my mother? Leonard. Haven't I always been good to you? Good to me? You've always been g-good to me, Mr. Z. Didn't I help you get the mortgage on this place for your mother? You 're a saint, Mr. Z. I kind of treated you like a pet, didn't I? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Sit down, Leonard. We searched every step of Raymond's route 5500 times and still no money. Mr. Z, don't you remember that I was the one that tipped you off? Mmn-hmn. And we searched every square inch of that asswipe leabag motel. - And still no money. - Mr., Z, please! I swear to you. I swear on my mother. I swear on my mother! Oh, your mother. She said she didn't know anything either. Even after we took her glasses. Monmy. And her hearing aid. And her teeth. Mommy. Mommy. And her little bird. Lucia no. Now, in exactly 20 minutes, Vance is gonna deliver your mother here. Don't worry about her. I told him to soothe her with milkshakes and whatever the fuck else she could gum down at the drive thru. Now, if... and this is a big if', Leonard if you are telling the truth then someone in that hotel got my money. I don't have it. I don't have it. I don't have it. If you're a good dog you'll fetch and retrieve it for me. If you don't... I can only come to one conclusion. Leonard, if you spend one dime that looks suspicious next time, you won't be swearing on your mother. You'll be swearing on her grave. Who is it? It's Walt. Oh, honey, come on in. The door's open. Surprise! Come on in the house. Come on. Surprise. Happy graduation! Happy graduation! Happy graduation! Yeah, sing it up! Happy graduation! Happy graduation! Wanna dance? I'd love to. But I should go. Bye, honey. Take care o f yourself. Mr. My Left Foot. This is the movie I was talking about. My Left Foot. This is for you to keep. It's very inspirational Do you like my cufflinks? And they really shoot BBs. If you like this, I can get you another one. It's called The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Have you heard of it before? It's my favourite. It's about this guy who's really misshapen. Even worse than you. And he falls in love with this beautiful fiery, wild, gypsy girl called Esmerelda. She kinda looks like me. Let's dance! Oh, God. My tits are falling down. Here, you wanna see 'em? Here's what it is. Hello! Pizza, everyone! All right! Carmine, Carmine! Let me pay for them. We got 'em. I got one, and Carmine and his folks are getting the other. Hi, Carmine. I have to get goin'. My father's waitin'. A lot of work to do. Carmine, why don't you have a drink? Come on, have a drink. Let me touch you r chest. Girls, take him down! Take him down! No. You first. My popper, good popper Give me a kiss, honey. She's sweet, right? God, how old is she? She's a Leo. I asked how old she was. I... You know, I don't know. I met her when she was wearing a uniform. Oh, yeah? What kind of uniform? You know, that school outfit or whatever. What school? The little Catholic place down the street. Junior high? High school? You know, yeah. You know. Take it off! Look at that. Oh, my God! Look at his stomach, Jesus Christ! Goddamn, Carmine! I sent you an hour ago! Come on! - Let him stay! - Hey! Leave the guy alone. Leave him alone Carmine, I love you! Oh, my God. She shot me. Oh, my God. I'm scarred! And the big contest is tomorrow night. It was an accident. I'm sorry. - I told you not to wear those guns. - Look, you 're so stupid! Oh, Rusty. I shot my best friend in the tit with my cufflink. I didn't mean it. You know I never would have believed that we could have gotten through this together. I mean, I can't believe that I could. I mean, that I could... you know, actually be of some kind of help to someone like you. You know, the big hero and all you know? I'm no big hero. I'm... I'm scared. I need a drink. Well, what could you be scared of? What's the worst fear? That you'll fall on the street? Someone'll make fun of you? I mean, what? I'm... I'm afraid that women won't want to sleep with me any more. Well, guess what? Some of them won't. So you'll just have to find the ones that will, Walt. And just remember this is who you are, Waldo. You 're Walt "the Wall" Koontz, a true hero. Who's the little guy? Joe. Joe. Joe and me were friends for years. Best friends. He really wanted to better himself. I really admired him. He went to school nights and on weekends... to learn computers. Got a... big job in Asia with computers. I drove him to the airport... and off Joe went to Asia. Two days later, the bank... has $200.000 missing. Oh. Oh, Christ. Somehow done from the inside with computers. Nobody ever heard from Joe again. I drove Joe to the airport. Got used by my best friend. I never told anybody that. Some hero, huh? Well... Since it's confession night... at Our Lady of Perpetual Disco I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone. I've got... Mr. Z's money. I got here right when you were being rushed to the hospital, you know. And when the cops left, I went up. Cos Amber had given me her key and told me where she had always hid her money. She always had some money set aside for her funeral cos she always knew that she was gonna die young. And of course, she did. Poor baby. So, where is it? Right in here, honey where Momma always knows where it is. Right here in hips, ass and titty city, sweetheart. It's gonna pay for my operation. And when I come back you know, a new woman I'm gonna give Amber a funeral and a monument and an eternal flame, honey. Just like Princess Diana. Wait a minute. You said that... You said that you needed the money from the lessons, right? But if I was your your cover? So all the sewing jobs the crying poor the... my lessons that was all that was all so that Leonard would not suspect you? Wait a minute, honey. I mean, you... You used me cos of my condition. Excuse me! Check your playbill, Judge Ito. You came to me. That's cos I needed help. And you used me. Truth, baby? You wanna play fucking truth? You needed someone you weren't ashamed to be crippled in front of. All right? Someone you thought was so beneath you. A worse freak so you could feel superior and still be the big fucking man. At least... At least I'm a real man. Everybody, including Wolf fucking Blitzer on CN N knows you don't think I'm a real man, honey. All right, what? Cos I don't... What? Shit in the woods? I don't shoot guns? You know? Let me tell you something, baby. It takes a shitload more courage to wake up and face my life than anything you've ever fuckin' dreamed of, all right? You couldn't handle real adversity, honey. That's the truth. Truth? You want fuckin' truth? You 're never gonna be a woman. You're an ugly fat faggot. There's truth. You're an ugly fuckin' fat faggot. I am more man than you will ever be and more woman than you will ever get. - You wish! - Yeah, I do wish! All right, honey? And while the hate was pouring out of you, you didn't stutter. Now haul your sorry, crippled ass out of my house. Move it, gimpy. Watch your mouth! Or you'll beat the shit out of me? You r days of beating the shit are over! Face it, Waldo, your hero days are over. And you're a fuckin' faggot. I may be a female impersonator, but you my friend, are a male impersonator! Fuck you! Yeah, life's a bitch so I became one! Oh, my God. Look who's here, Sal. We gotta say hello. Hey, Walt. How you doin'? Hey, Tommy. It's good to see you, man. Welcome back. That's OK. I'm goin' over there. We'll talk to you. Right. Hey, Walter. How are you? OK. I've really missed you. Well, thanks. Mmm, flowers. For me? Not exactly. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. I brought you some flowers.

You girls that way! This is what gives drag queens a bad name. You two are banned from the contest next year. - Maybe so, hefty. - Yeah. You 're old and Im young and I'm gonna live to piss on your fuckin' grave. Hello, buzzard! This was the first time I... since this... happened. I was real nervous. But you were great. You were great. You were? I was nervous. You just need to be around somebody. I don't know, that... that likes you... just the way you are. Somebody else said that to me. Said Some girls won't like you like this. "You gotta find the one that will". Yeah, well, they didn't bullshit you They told you the truth whoever it was. She must be a real good friend, huh? Why do you say she? I don't know. It sounds like something a woman would say. Why? Was it a man? Well, not... not exactly. Well, whatever. Whoever it was... sounds like a good friend. Good evening, Mr. Koontz. If you hear anything in the building later tonight... - Like what? - Anything at all. Just ignore it. Pretend it's not happening. Do you know the phrase Two closed ears, one closed mouth? That's my motto and I follow it. To hear nothing, to see nothing, to speak nothing. I... I don't care what goes on in this rat trap. Who are you kiddin'?

I earned that money. $35.000 for a complete series of female hormone therapy. $25.000 for extensive psychological testing before therapy. Another $40.000 due.
