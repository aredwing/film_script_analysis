[Man] Hop in the old jalop and [Woman] Head for the malted shop and [Chorus] All the cats join in Down goes my last two bits Comes up one banana split And all the cats join in [Horn Honking] Drop yourjack in the old jukebox - [Tires Screech] - Play your favorite disc When you dance with the bobby socks You dance at your own risk Rip, everybody swing Yes, swing till the rafters ring And all the cats join in [Tires Screech] [Scatting] [Continues] [Crowd] Yea! Rafters ringin' How they're swingin' All the cats join in [Orchestra] I'm so lonely and blue When I'm without you I don't know what I'd do Sweetheart, without you The joy and tears That love endears Would have no meaning If I didn't have you To keep me dreaming At the close of each day When I'm without you And my heart kneels to pray I pray about you You take a star And lead it far away From heaven And the star will be lost As I'm lost without you At the close of each day When I'm without you And my heart kneels to pray I pray about you You take a star And lead it far away From heaven And the star will be lost As I'm lost without you [Orchestra Ends] [Upbeat Piano] [Band] [Band] [Chorus] Oh, what a lark to ride out to the park - [Whistles] - And just to see Casey They travel for miles and they stand in the aisles - [Whistles] - And just to see Casey The ladies don't understand baseball a bit They don't know a strike from a foul or a hit But when they see Casey that game has got it Casey the pride of them all [Man Sustaining Note] All The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville Nine that day The score was four to two With but one inning left to play Listen, ya bunch of bush leaguers. This here is the ninth inning, in case you don't know it. It's the windup, the blow off. Come on now, unbutton your shirts. Now get in there and fight. Who's up next? Cooney! [Colonna] The coach was really worried when Cooney went to bat, but all he had to offer was 300 pounds of fat. Ah, but Cooney was determined. He tried to do his worst. He kept his batting average all right, and as usual... died at first. - You're out! - Attaboy! Uh, hurray for our side! Hurray, hurray! - Aw, shut up! - Sit down! Kill the ump, the bum! I'll kick the stuffin's out of him. Yeah, run that guy outta town on the rails. [Colonna] Barrows was the next one up and Barrows made a hit. Wow, he smacked a beauty right in the pitcher's mitt. - You're out! - [All Shouting] - [All] Boo! - There goes the... A straggling few got up to go, ah, but the loyal fans stood pat. They'd put up even money now were Casey at the bat. Ah, but Flynn preceded Casey, of all the stupid guys. The bat is getting in his hair. Now the hair is getting in his bat. Egad, he let drive a single much to his own surprise. [Crowd Cheering] - Safe! - [Cheering] The next one in the lineup was No-HitJimmy Blake. Of all the mugs in Mudville, he was the biggest fake. - But he was really blazing and to the wonderment of all, - Wah-ha-ho! Blake the fake tore the cover off the ball! [Crowd Laughing] And when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred, there was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-huggin'third. Cozy, isn't it? You're safe! [Cheering] [Chanting] We want Casey! We want Casey! We want Casey! - [Giggling] - [Chorus] Oh Casey's the guy with his eye on the ball - [Whistles] - [Colonna] But mostly the ladies [Chorus] Casey's the guy who's the idol of all - [Whistles] - [Colonna] But mostly the ladies [Chorus] Casey is mighty and manly Casey's a dangerous gent [Colonna] Egad, when he goes to bat hang on to your hat He's batting a thousand percent with the ladies Oh, Casey has nerve and he knows every curve - [Whistles] - He's no hokeypokey - [Grunts] - He gets away with that old double play - [Whistles] - He's sure okeydokey [Chorus] He makes all the ladies go ga-ga, it's true No wonder they swoon when he comes into view [Colonna] He was the Sinatra of 1902 [All] Casey, the pride of them all [Squealing, Giggling] [Colonna] The pitcher's nerves were jagged and his knees began to shake. Hey, can't catch me! Can't catch me! One eye was watching Flynn... and the other eye watching Blake. [Players Heckling] [Gulps] While the frightened pitcher ground the ball into his hip, defiance gleamed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip. [Chortling] And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air, and Casey stood a-watching it... in haughty grandeur there. Close by the sturdy batsman, the ball unheeded sped. "That ain't my style," said Casey. St-t-t-t-rike one! The umpire said. - [Babbling] - From the benches black with people, there went up a mighty roar, like the beating of the ocean on a stern and distant shore. Kill him! Kill the umpire! Yelled a cutie from the stands. And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand. With a smile of Christian charity, great Casey's visage shone. He stilled the rising tumult and bade the game go on. [People Shouting] He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew. But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, quote... St-t-t-t-t-trike two! - Unquote. - [Booing] "Fraud,"cried the maddened thousands, and the echo answered, "Fraud!" But one scornful look from Casey... and the audience was awed. They saw his face go stern and cold. They saw his muscles strain. And they knew that Casey would not let that ball go by again. [All] Ooh! The sneer is gone from Casey's lip. His teeth are clenched in hate. He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate. And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go. And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow! [Women] Somewhere in this favored land - The sun is shining bright - [Chirping] [Colonna] Ah, yes. [Women] Somewhere bands are playing sweet [Full Chorus] And somewhere hearts are light [Colonna] Somewhere men are laughing [Laughing] Somewhere children shout [Thunderclaps] But there is no joy in Mudville. Mighty Casey has struck out! [Sobbing, Blubbering] [Angry Yell] [Frustrated Grunts] [Chorus, Colonna] Casey, the pride of them all [Colonna Sustaining Note] All What do you know? The game is over. Two silhouettes Together in the afterglow Two silhouettes Become as one When lights are low And with the night slumbering on We'll build a dream for two Aperfect dream set to a theme Lovely as you Two hearts on fire Will soon inspire The stars to dance The flames that stray will light the way To our romance And when I hold you in my arms To my heart's delight Two silhouettes will drift away Into the night Two hearts on fire Will soon inspire The stars to dance The flames that stray will light the way To our romance And when I hold you In my arms To my heart's delight Two silhouettes Will drift away Into the night Will drift away Into the night Now, this is a story of, uh, uh, uh, uh, "Peter and the Wolf." As you know, in the musical score of"Peter and the Wolf," each character is represented... by a corresponding instrument in the orchestra. Peter, by the string quartet. [String Quartet] The bird, whose name is Sascha, by a flute, way up high. [Flute] Sonia, the duck, by an oboe, like this. [Oboe] And here is Ivan, the cat, represented by a clarinet... [High Voice] In a very low... [Deep Voice] Ahem, in a very low register. [Clarinet] Grandpapa is an old bassoon. [Bassoon] The shooting of the hunters'guns, by the kettledrums. [Kettledrums] And there is also a wolf. [Dramatic] [Snarling] Little does that wolf know... what's in store for him this day. For our hero, little Peter, armed to the teeth, is setting forth to capture him. Uh-oh. There seems to have been a change of plans. [Bassoon] For Peter's grandpapa thinks that little boys like Peter... should not go out to hunt the wolf. This is very embarrassing for a great hunter. [String Quartet] [Bassoon] - [String Quartet] - [Whistling] - [Flute] - And this is Sascha, the little bird we told you about. Excitable little chap, isn't he? Forgetful too. [Flute Continues] [Holloway As Sascha] "Hello, Petie. What goes? Where ya goin, huh? Can I go, Petie? Can I? Huh? Oh, boy! A gun! Loaded too! Going hunting? Ohh! That's for me! Everything's okay, Petie. Come on. Let's go!" [String Quartet] [Flute] The wolf! - [Oboe] - But it isn't the wolf at all. It's only Sonia the duck. [Oboe, Flute] "Hello, Sonia." "Hello, Petie." Now Sonia wants to join the party. [Oboe] Imagination is a wonderful thing! [Snarling] But sometimes it can run away with you. [Flute] "You coward!" [Clarinet] Now who's this? Oh, it can't be... [Chuckling] Oh, no. It's Ivan the cat! Hello, Ivan! Ivan's a peaceful, fun-loving sort. Maybe a little shy on brains. You know the type. Hey! Look out, Sascha! "Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!" [Clarinet] Oh, how can they ever get any place... if they're going to fight among themselves? "Ivan, you ought to be ashamed! You big bully! You cat-in-the-grass!" "Come on, Sascha. Ivan's sorry. He won't do it again." [Hissing] [Dramatic] And so, once more, our little band of intrepid hunters sets forth to find the wolf. - And they find him. - [Screeching] [Dramatic] Sonia! Sonia! Behind you! Look out! W-O-L-F! [Snarling] Oh! That wolf is everywhere! Peter, do something! Oh, no. Look, Peter, why don't ya... Look, maybe if you could... Then maybe Peter... Oh, well. Peter, don't just stand that way! And don't stand that way either! [Oboe] Oh, Sonia! This is no time to relax! [Snarling] [Oboe] [Snarling] [Dramatic] [Snarling] Poor Sonia! [Oboe] Well, that's one gone. Good-bye, Sonia. [Oboe] Will this crime go unavenged? - [Snarling] - Not if little Sascha can help it. [Snarling] [Flute] You, you, you beast! Take this and this and this! How do you like this, eh? And this, eh? How about this, eh? Not so good, eh? Good work, Sascha! Uh-oh. Trouble! Sascha! Sascha, get up! Get up! Get out of there! [Dramatic] [Dramatic] - [Snarling] - [Flute] Look out, please, for overconfidence. Oh! This is bad. This is very bad. [Violins] Saved! [Snarling] [Dramatic] Just when things are looking blackest... Hark! What's that we hear? [Cossack Music] What's this we see? [Cossack Music] The hunters! Mischa, Yascha, and Vladamir! That's Vladamir in the middle. [Kettledrums] Wait a minute. I'll show you. W-O-L-F. Wolf! Wolf? To the rescue! [Cossack Music] [Dramatic] [Whistle] [Kettledrums] Oh, Peter, you're safe! You've captured the wolf! Oh, happy day! I think I'll say that again. Oh, happy day! Oh, Peter, what a hero! You too, Ivan. Everybody's happy... except the wolf! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! [Sobbing] But little Sascha isn't happy. He's thinking of his lost playmate, Sonia. Sonia. Sonia? Sonia! Oh, then you're not dead! You're safe! Oh, Sonia. This is the most wonderful, wonderful day! The wolf is captured! Peter caught him!

Read all about it! - Paper! - A singing whale - What do ya know - Imagine that I don't believe it I don't believe it For who ever heard of an operatic whale I don't believe it I don't believe it Then headline followed headline Then doctors and experts And men of anatomical biology - Debated and argued - [Barking] And quoted ichthyology Impossible Preposterous We savagely deny it Magnificent Miraculous We certainly certify it And even the great impresario Of the grand opera Raised an eyebrow And tried and tried to figure it out [Italian Accent] Hmm. This a-whale, she's a-maybe swallow the opera singer. That's it! This a-whale, she's a-swallow the opera singer! I find-a the great Signor Donatelli in the fish market. I discover the great Lilli Galli in the honky tonky. Then why not I find the opera singer... in the belly of a whale, huh? I do it! Oh, get-a me a great big schooner And get-a me a good harpooner Photographers and reporters from all the newspapers Publicity Publicity Publicity [Eddy] Publicity, yes. But to Whitey the sea gull, it was opportunity, the big opportunity... for his friend, Willie the whale. There was no time to lose. He must bring these two together. Well, there was Tetti-Tatti now. And Tetti-Tatti was in for a wonderful surprise. Because Willie hadn't swallowed any opera singer. He could really sing. Listen. Mammy's little baby loves shortenin', shortenin' Mammy's little baby loves shortenin' bread Mammy's little baby loves shortenin', shortenin' Mammy's little baby loves shortenin' bread Two little children lyin' in bed One of'em sick and the other most dead Call for the doctor The doctor said Feed them children on shortenin' bread Mammy's little baby loves shortenin, shortenin' Mammy's little baby loves shortenin'bread - Mammy's little baby loves shortenin, shortenin' - [Dinging] Mammy's little baby loves Shortenin' bread - Mmm! - [Applause] After all these years... of casting his shortenin'bread upon the waters, - now, at last, success lay just over the waves. - [Seagull Squawks] Willie! Willie! Willie, look! That's you, Willie. He's looking for you. It's your big opportunity. Willie's going to be a great star. Our Willie, going to sing grand opera! Good-bye, my friends I'm off to be discovered Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la I'm off to be discovered At last, the long years of patient waiting... and the endless hours of faithful practice... were about to be rewarded. As Willie sped to his audition, he wondered what he should sing for his opening number. What would impress this impresario? How about a bit of"Figaro"? Yes, sure, "Figaro." [Willie Singing In Italian] [Singing Continues] La-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la There she's a-blows! There she's a-blows! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! [Willie] Figaro, Figaro, Figaro. Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro! - [Squawking] - Figaro! [Willie Singing In Italian] Shoot-a the whale! [Continues] [Continues] [Willie] Figaro! Figaro! Hey! [Whistles] Figaro! [Continues] [Continues] [Continues] Hurry up! Hurry up! Rescue the opera singer! - Shh! - Shh! - Shh! [Continues] [Gurgling] [Finale] Don't a-worry! We'll a-save you! Ta La-la La-laaaa - Bravo! - [Whistling] Bravissimo! Bravo! [Eddy] Ah, but they hadn't heard the half of it. Well, they hadn't even heard a third of it. For Willie was no ordinary singing whale. Willie could sing in three separate voices. - La-la-la-la-la-la - Tenor. - La-la-la-la-la-la - Baritone. - La-la-la-la-la-la - And bass. La-la Why, Willie was a singing miracle! [Tenor Voice: Italian] [Continues] Let-a me up! This is a-mutiny! [Mutters] [Continues] [Baritone Voice Joins In] [Squawks] Mamma mia! He's a-swallowed two opera singers! [Continues] [Bass VoiceJoins In] [Squawks] He's a-swallowed three opera singers! Stubborn, deluded Tetti-Tatti. For right there before his very eyes... was the biggest discovery in all musical history. Just imagine, a whale... singing opera on the very stage of the Met. [Singing In Italian] [Continues] [Finale] [Applause] Bravo! [Cheering] [Applause, Cheering] - Bravo! Bravissimo! - [Whistling] [Barking] [Squawking] Ah, mio core Ah, dolore Ahh Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Io pian... Go - Tristan - Isolde - Geliebter - Geliebter [Singing In German] [Continues] [Continues] Je suis mefisto Roi de I'enfer Je veux Ta Vie [Holds Note] I got him! I got him! Vittoria! Vittoria! [Eddy] Now Willie will never sing at the Met. But don't be too harsh on Tetti-Tatti. He just didn't understand. You see, Willie's singing was a miracle, and people aren't used to miracles. And you, faithful little friend, don't be too sad. Because miracles never really die. And somewhere, in whatever heaven is reserved... for creatures of the deep, Willie is still singing... - in a hundred voices, each more golden than before. - [Willie Singing] And he'll go on singing... amid the applause and the cheering... forever. [Willie Singing In Italian] [Continues] [Continues] [Finale]
