And I'm telling you that what really happen was far, far more terrifying than anything the story-tellers ever admitted. It started in the royal palace... where a king, Maximilian lay dying. Bring me... ... my son. Bring me... ... my son. Your son died at birth, your Majesty, many years ago. You've to choose a successor. And choose from among those present, your Majesty. Us, your noble relatives. Word with you, cousin. You and I are the leading contenders for the throne. I am the leading contender, Count Rudolph. You were just one ambitious noble among many. So you wouldn't consider perhaps forming an alliance? - Maybe working together. - I know you too well, cousin. You're mean, vicious and cruel. And ruthless. You forgot to mention "ruthless." - Did I? - Yes Never forget "ruthless." You shan't forget it again. Help! Somebody help! For the love of God, somebody help. Duke Edward... seems to have suffered a ruthless accident. Very good, Rudolph! You shall reign, promise. And now, my little darling... are you ready to come to mama? - Coming? - Let's go! - ... see ya! - I'll see you! Belle, come on in here. I need help. These washing doesn't smell right. What would you like the dirty washing to smell like, mother? Like the old mixture you made, you know. It had lavender and eucalyptus and queen's bane... and all the customers said it made their washing smell nice and fresh. She is right, you know, Belle. That's why I bring my washing here because of all the wonderful scents you put in. Well, I'm sorry we're all out of that mixture, Dr. Thorne. But I'm making a new one today, want to smell? Ah... Belle, always the experimenter! Well, it was watching you mixing medicine growing up, ...that made me think with such wonderful thing. What is it, Belle? I mean there's nothing more satisfying than seeing someone who is sick and knowing you've what they need to bring them back to health. And where did you get those from? From the forest, like all the others. Essence of oak, oil of pine, camphor leaves... Camphor and pine? I have a feeliing they may not go well together. Anyway, you spend far too much time wandering around the forest, it's a dangerous place! Come on, Mom. The forest is wonderful and beautiful and I love it! And in all your explorations, you've never seen any sign of the - ... famous Beast? - The Beast? That just a story people made up to scare themselves. Oh, I guess this one could used some work. I knew there was something about that combination. If that would have happened in my washing boiler. Mother, it's all trial and error. Brsides... I go out and get some herbs for a new combination. You are not going out now? Why not? There's no time like the present. Besides, Dr. Thorne doesn't want his washing smelling bad, does he? By Asteroth and Ishtar... By Beelzebub and Ahura Mazda... By all the heart of darkness that sip beneath this fatal earth... I command you to come forward! Yes, my dear. Come to me. Yes... you shall do my biddings. Who are you? I said who are you? - Water to the horses. - Yes, sir. And so Count, concerning the throne, do you think it'll come to a fight? Let me put to you this way, - I want you to start recruiting more men. - Hmm! If I can't bring the Nobles around with persuasion, it may take a show of force. You'll need more than that, Count Rudolph. Lady Helen, to what do we owe the pleasure? I've come here to help you become king, cousin. Shall we step aside? I was impressed with how decisively you dealt with Duke Edward, Rudolph. Duke Edward's death was nothing more than an unfortunate accident. Come on, I've ways of seeing these things, you know that. That's right...I've forgot. You dabbling with witchcraft. Witchcraft that can help you reached the throne. And why would you do that? What could possibly be in it for you? The fact that I would also like to be on the throne as your queen. Excuse me? Am I not beautiful? Your heart is black as hell and everyone knows it. If you want to be king, Rudolph, you'll need my black heart. I will get the throne without your help, milady. - Good day. - Oh no, you won't. Because I've at my disposal something that would destroy any hopes you have. And what exactly would that be? Think about my offer, Rudolph. Think about the pleasure I can give you... and the power... and what I might do if you spurned me. Lady Helen? Lady Helen! Lady Helen! - Count, are you alright? - Of course I am. - It takes more than a witch to scare me. - Oww...oww! Well! Well! My pretty maiden! What's your story? The Beast tried to kill me! The Beast is nothing more than a legend. You have let your imagination run away with you, young lady. Do I look like an idiot? The Beast killed a wolf... right in front of my eyes with a crossbow, and then he tried to kill me! Crossbow? That's the weapon the Beast's supposed to use. Well .. Certainly would be another feather in my cap if I was the one to capture it. Show the Beast head to the people, they gotta made you the king. The people adore you for your bravery! Which way to this... Beast? Back there, in the woods. A little vague, no matter... you're taking us. Spread out, look for tracks. Move along! - Spread out, men! - Right away, captain. There's no need to hold me so tight, Count. I'm quite comfortable on horseback. But I like holding you tight, Belle. Besides, how often does a washer woman's daughter get the chance to be intimate with Lord, hmm? - You should feel flattered. - Problem is, I don't. So get your lecherous hand's off me. You need a lesson in manners, wench. And you need a lesson in common courtesy. You little tramp! His head! - By all that's holy! - Over there! There it is! There's the Beast. After it. I'll deal with you later. Let's go! Come on! Come on! Halt! He's headed for the village. This way. What is going on? Elizabeth, gather the children! Over here, now! The doctor's house. That's the Beast on the roof. Good, it's trapped. Three... up there. The Beast, has gone through the window, sir. Get the people out. Somebody go in after the Beast. Move it! Move! - I'm in! - Get off me! Sheriff-- Otto, what happened? You look as though you've seen a ghost. - They're gonna kill him. - The Beast? Isn't that a good thing? No...no, he never did anybody any harm. Otto, I saw him tear a man's head right from his body. - You saw it? - I saw the body. How do you know the Beast was responsible? Careful... stay back! - Help me! - Dr. Thorne! Help me... help me! I'm thinking... Help me! Let me down! Let me down! - The Beast has killed the doctor! - No..no, it can't be him... Fire into the window... Fire! What's in the name of all that is holy... brought into our village? - There he is! - Come on... - After him both of you. - Yes, sir! Let's go. - He has gone into the woods. I promised each and everyone of you here now... I will see justice delivered! I, Count Rudolph of Breslau, will destroy that beast. Otto? Otto, what's the matter? - I've to... - You've to what? - ... talk to him. - Who? - I have to... - Someone... help me! Help me get him home. There, we got him there. And so they went off after the Beast. At the very minute when I could do nothing to stop them. I've been afraid of something like these for years. And now that it come, I was helpless. And without me, I knew... ... the Beast was doom. You must rest. He needs me... He needs me... What are you talking about? That thing just killed Dr. Thorne. No, no... you don't... you don't understand... Please sheriff, get some rest. What's going on? Keep your eyes open, men! Don't miss anything. It won't get away. There's no place. This isn't a tea party, gentlemen! Let's keep it moving! Let's have a look over there. Come on! Alright, ... hold your place. Come on... keep moving! Got any water left in your skin? Yeah, I think so. Hold on a second. We've been out here a long time. Come! Come on! Let's have a look over this side, come on! Is anybody here? The Beast killed the doctor. I can't believe it! I saw him tear a man head right from his body. - You see what? - I saw the body. Otto sent me. Otto... Sheriff Otto, in the village. - Otto? - Yes, Otto. He is very sick. He couldn't come. But he is worried about you. He used to bring me food... when I was small. Come on, yah! Move on! Come on... keep it moving. Come on! It was you who saved me from the wolf, wasn't it? With the crossbow. Yes. And then you turned and fire a crossbow at me. Why would you do that? To make you... go away. I did not want you to see me! Why did you kill those people, tear them to pieces? What people? I have kill no people. Someone killed them. - I saw Dr. Thorne torn apart. - I kill to eat. Only to eat! - Ask Otto. - Otto said you didn't kill them. But he is sick. He is very ill. That's why I came. You've brought hunters to kill me, haven't you? No... no, I didn't! You stay here! - Stay here! Don't move! - Please... No! You got it all wrong! No! Run! Oh my God, no! I had nothing to do with this. It was a creature, a troll. A troll? Does this look like my work? Does it? I am a hunter, with a crossbow. I don't have a speck of blood on me. I did not bring these men here. I believe and trust you. I wouldn't trust that ambitious rat Rudolph though. As fa as I am concerned, Count Rudolph can rot in hell. So who are you? What's your name? - Beast. - No, that's just what they called you. What's your real name? Drink this. You must have a name. If i have, I don't know what it is. Well someone must know. Perhaps Sheriff Otto. - Did he bring you here? - I don't know. All I know is he used to come here when I was small. He taught me to hunt. He was... he was good to me. Did he give you this? I don't know. I don't think so. I think I always had that, since I was a baby. What is this pattern around the rim? My pattern. You are very clever. I have a lot of time on my hands in the winter. When the wind howls and the snow falls... I sit by the fire and carved. The pattern of the Beast. Don't call yourself that. But it is what I am. Sack them dog. Pour it! Get out! I hope that was for me, but perhaps we could share it. As a kind of... loving cup. A pledge of our future partnership. - What the hell are you doing here? - I've come to soothe you. I understand you had a very trying afternoon. What the hell do you know about my day? Everything cousin. You see that monster, was my creation. The Beast? It wasn't the Beast that killed the doctor or your men. - Then what was it? - It was my troll. A vicious maniacal killing machine control only by me. With a little help from this. - A troll? - Yes! And unless you pledge your trust to me, dear Rudolph... that troll will ensured you never get anywhere near the throne of our beloved country. So what are you going to do now? - Do? - Well, you can't stay here anymore. They'll just send more men to kill you. Do you've somewhere else you can hide? I have a shelter up between the hills. Yes... stay there hidden until I come back. - You'll never come back. - Of course I will. - Why? - What do you mean, why? You don't have to pretend you want to see me again. You have had some horrible things happened to you. I guess I feel like some of it is my fault. So Count, what will it be? Are we partners or not? Let's say I entertain the idea and you call off the troll, how's that help me get the throne? Well, hope you catch the Beast. The Beast is famous... If you were to bring him down, the whole kingdom will look up to you. And you and I will ascend the throne. How in the world can I possibly trust you? That's simple... I need you. They will not allowed a woman to rule alone. But with you by my side, anything is possible. And without me, you don't stand a chance. Here's to a great partnership. I drink to success, milady. I haven't decided on the partnership yet. - My lord? - Come! Sorry to disturb you, Count. You told us to bring any news as soon as it came. We found this one coming out of the forest. Well, well, well... if it isn't my little spitfire. Washer woman daughter, right? I believe you and I have a little unfinished business. You know this woman, Count? She's the one who alerted us to the Beast rampage. Then had objection when I took her with me to go find it. What I objected to was you fondling me like some lecherous old goat. Well, is that what you think of him? Let me look at you. I can see why Count Rudolph got so excited. You're quite a beauty, ain't you? And you saw the Beast? - I said did you see the Beast. - I've nothing to say to you! How dare you speak to your superior like that, you tramp? What did you see? I believe the "rack" might loosen her tongue, milady. Oh no, there's no need for that, Count. I have much better methods. Oh yes... show me more. Is that possible? What is it? I thought it was dead! You thought what was dead? The monster? What is this? It is just a hair, milady. But it's not one of her's. I'm done with her now. But I haven't yet. Take her to the dungeon and secured her. - I'll be down later. - Alright you... come along. She is still under, sir. She'll comes around soon enough. And then wish she hadn't. Take her away. - That beast must be killed. - You speak the obvious, milady. No, there is another reason. It could be that the animal known as the Beast, sat between us and the throne. - What's the problem? - Count's order, sir. - To the dungeon. - Chained her properly. Look at her, sir. She's away with the fairies. Away with the fairies? Away with the fairies, you moron. Open the door! - No use, the bitch locked it. - Get an ax here! What the hell! - Move it! - Yes, sir! - Open it! - Yes, sir! I will break your neck! - Hurry up! - We nearly got it, sir. Pattern of the Beast! What is that noise? Guards... guard! What's that noise? I nearly got it, sir. Come on, men! Come on! Get out of my way! Out of my way. Why aren't you at your post? Guards? Guards? Guards? Where the devil is everyone? Forget about them. We need to talk about the Beast. So, you keep saying. So why don't you tell me how... does this Beast stand between me and the throne? Stairs! Stairs! Do you remember the story about Maximilian only son? He was deformed, wasn't it? He died at birth. And that's what we thought. That's what I believed, until tonight. And now? And now I believe he may not have died. That the Beast may actually be Maximilian's son... Clear! Nothing here, sir! You check over there. You check over... ... there. All clear over here,sir. Who else knows this? Nobody, I hope. - And what does it matter? - Because if somebody finds out... Then what? The shutters aren't fasten. There's no way down there, sir. It is impossible. Get me a torch, hurry! Listen, having that monster alive is like having a sword hanging over our head. And no one in their right mind is going to accept that thing as heir to the throne... Stop arguing and understand this! The Beast must die, and he must die soon as possible. Agreed! The problem is going to be finding him. Found anything, captain? There she is! - Quick, guards! - Come on, quick... It might just be that the beautiful Belle has given us what we need to find him. The hair of the Beast. By thorn and by root... by blade and by chalices... I call upon that from which this comes. Beast of the forest, can you hear me? What? Who is there? A friend. A friend that wants to warn you. Where are you? Show yourself!. Belle is in grave danger. Belle? The troll is on her track. He'll be there by morning. Only you can save her. - How? - It is up to you, Beast. Go to her house in the village. Save her! I can't see you, I don't know who you are. - Why should I believe you? - Don't believe me, if you choose. But then, my friend, the troll will tear her apart, and it will be your fault. Well, I think we've got him hook. Impressive. Now, all you have to do, is make sure you're there. - Through this way. - Yes, sir. That Beast will met the troll, is that true? Yeah, it will be. Cause I've seen this creature and he's dangerous. Well, now that you and I are partners, Count, you're in no danger. That troll is under my command. You're absolutely sure of that? Oh, yes. Remember, he will do anything for a drop of this. And, of course, he wouldn't hurt anyone I didn't want hurt. There's no need for you to come with me tomorrow morning. There is every need. The Beast must not be allowed to say a word before he's killed. You're absolutely sure he'll be in the house tomorrow morning? Well, if he is not, we'll have to make sure he is. It must be like he did the killings. And don't worry. My creation has his instructions. Over there, sir! Look! - Dogs are on their way, sir. - No, she's heading for the stream. Sir? She's got into the water where the dogs lose her scent. We'll just follow the stream to where she came out. Try to keep up. She crossed here. That way! Washer woman? Where does the washer woman live? - Over there. - Thank you. Open up! Quickly! Get up! - Who is there? Who is it? - Argh! The troll's coming from the roof. Help me! Quickly! - The troll is here! - Stay away! You must come out! - They're here. - Move back. He's coming to get you. He's inside? - Leave me alone! - It is time. Spread out. Surround the house. Let no one pass. First person to bring me the head of the Beast win 1000 francs. Open it now! Listen! The troll's coming through the roof! He's coming to get you. The sheriff will be here any minute. Open the door or you'll die! You'll die! No way! Help me! What is going on? - Help me! - Open the door! Wait, give it time to kill him. It just wants me. Don't let him get you! Okay. Now! Halt! Get him! Hold him! We've got him. Bound him! - I'll take it from here. - Yes, Count. This is the part I enjoy. It appeared the Beast has met his match. Your murderous rampage is finish. And the people of our beloved country... will have me to thank for your death. Congratulations, Count. The people owed you a debt of gratitude. You can say the congratulation when the job's finish. Of course, sir. As soon as the trial's over, we'll be singing your praises. - Trial? - Put this on him. Of course, my lord. What trial? We caught the Beast red-handed! He certainly looks guilty, your Honor... with the poor old laundress lying dead. But King Maximilian laws insist we trial people. King Maximilian? Befoe executing them. And I know you're sworn to uphold those laws, just like the rest of us... while the King is alive. So if you'll excuse me, your honor. Count Rudolph has subdued the Beast! The trial will take place tomorrow. Come to the window, my lord. And accept the acclaimation of the people. We'll take it from here. The jail are very strong. Thank you. Thank you. Come... come on.You don't want him escaping, do you? Come on. Damn it! You vain glorious fool! Why didn't you kill him when you've the chance? Put him inside the jail before they turn on him. Get him lock up and bring me the key! Get back, all of you. Move it! - What... what's going on here? - I'm sorry, Belle! - What're you sorry about? - Something terrible... What? What happened to her? - Let me... - Sorry, Belle. - It appeared the Beast has killed your mother. - No! It was only my regard for the law that stop me from killing him - on the spot. - What happen to my mother mother! Let me go! I need to see her! The trial must be swift and just. This Beast must not be allowed to commit an actrocity like this again. The jury will sworn in as soon as possible, my lord... and in the meantime, our grateful thanks. Till tomorrow, then. You fool! You should have killed him when you had the chance. She worked so hard! She worked so hard for me! I could never tell her how much I loved her. - Oh... I think she knew. - I can never tell her. Who is there? If you try that again, and I'll throw this right between your eyes, before you've time to pull the trigger! Just try it! We'll never forget your mother. Either of us. - But it's my fault! - Your fault? How? I met the Beast, I trusted him... And if it wasn't for me, he would never have come here. You don't think the Beast killed your mother, do you? Otto, the Beast was found beside my mother body! It was the troll, Belle. It was the troll, he told me. That's what he said... yeah, back at the village. There was a troll... I mean, where's this troll? Any time he comes around, something bad happens and he's a monster. No, no, no. What's really going on here, Otto? Who is this Beast? Well, it all started when Maximilian fell in love... with Lady Helen of Augsburg. For a long time... she was the only woman for him. He couldn't take his eyes off her. - ... they went everywhere together. - I thought they never married. People said he discovered she was cruel and hard-hearted, and a sorcerer. He shunned her, and... well, they became bitter enemies. The King .. King married the beautiful Elizabeth of Austria... and eventually they had a child. But I thought the King was childless. I thought the Queen died giving a still-born. No. No, Helen cast a spell on the baby, and he was born terribly deformed. Poor Maximilian was distraughted by the death of his wife... - ..and he couldn't accept the child. - How do you know all this, Otto? I was a servant in the palace... and I was ordered to disposed of the child. Though he was hideous, I couldn't bring myself to do it. I took him to a old hunting lodge deep in the forest... that I went to with my father as a boy. I bring the lad food as often as I could but... ... eventually he didn't need it. I taught him to hunt for himself. Does the King knows he still has a son? No, no. No one does.. As I got to know him, I... I realized that beneath that horrible exterior... was one of the kindest, gentlest being I've ever known. A true prince, Belle...huh. I promise you that. A true prince-- Does he knows? It would have been too cruel. It sounds like you really care for him. As if... as if he were my own son. And I know he could never do any of the thing that he's been accused of. I believe you. It's... it's just-- What? I think I cared for him too. Come on, let's go see him. - Who goes there? - It is me, Sheriff Otto. - Let us through. - Halt! What's she doing here? She has the right to confront the killer of her own mother, doesn't she? Now... let us pass. Well... I warn you, he's got a weapon. He could kill you without even leaving his cell. - How did that happen? - Never mind. Yeah... well, we'll take our chances. There's no need for the rest of you to stay here the whole night. He is secure enough, wether he's got a weapon or not. Count orders, we stayed here until the thing's executed. It's a waste of time putting him on trial if you ask me. I did not kill her. I know. I believe you. Otto told me your real story. - What real story? - About who you are. - I think you should know the truth. - Belle, no. Alright, then. You're probably right. Damn her eyes! Why didn't that fool Rudolph get rid of him when he could? And why didn't I get rid of him? I'll send you in my little one, but we can't risk letting anyone seeing you now, can we? Not until the Beast has been proven guilty. But after that... there'll be plenty of works to do, won't there? So you shouldn't be in this jail cell. You should be in the Royal Palace, acclaimed as the next king. It's true! Don't you believe it? I believe you, I believe Otto. But who else will believe? If Helen used sorcery, if she casts a spell... perhaps it could be broken. - Broken? - Well, in the story, there's usually something. What? Come here. Closer. Put your face between the bars. What're you doing? Close your eyes. You kissed me. I was trying to break the spell. Not so easy, I think. No. Alright...that'll do. Time for you to go. You need your beauty sleep. Come on! The King is dead! The King is dead! God bless the King! The King is dead! The King is dead! God bless the King! The King is dead! The King is dead! God bless the King! Hear me lad. Place the head there! Hold it! Get out of the way. Hold him. Stand out of the way! Tie him up! Hold him. Shut up! What the hell do you think you're doing? Following orders! This is a trial, not a torture chamber! The prisoner've to be kept secured for the safety of the jury. - And also kept quiet. - I am the sheriff here. And I will not let you do that! It's on account of you we're doing it. - What? - The Beast attacked you. What are you talking about? Of course it didn't attacked me! Oh yes he did! Vicious huh? Dump him somewhere. By the time he wakes up, it'll be all over. - You find her? - No, sir. - What? - The house is empty. We went round the whole village. Afraid she's escaped, sir. You are an idiot! No mind, we've got the place surrounded. If she tries to get in, we'll have her then. After he's dead, don't matter what. And he woke me up and said, "Where's the wash woman house?" And I showed him. And then he slammed my head against the table. The washer woman was torn to pieces. And the Beast was standing over her covered in blood. It is the same monster that I saw coming out of the old hunting lodge, and there he tore men apart in minutes. Well, I believe that's enough from prosecution. Is there anyone here to stand up for the accused? Anyone? Sheriff Otto? Sheriff Otto here to stand up for the accused? Sheriff Otto is too ill to attend, my lord. It seems the Beast attacked him. And the Beast himself have nothing to say. Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict? Is the Beast guilty or not gulty, of the dead of the - washer woman, Anna? - He's guilty. We have, my lord. And what say you, guilty or not guilty? Guilty, my lord. Quiet... quiet! Now I hereby announce sentencing... Death by beheading. - Woh! - For Anna! Immediately. Kill him! Kill the Beast! Let the ax fall. - Quick... run! - Who threw that? I can't see a thing. I think it's time to go, don't you? Bastards! - Thank you. - Keep your hands apart! Keep them on the block. They are getting away! Quick, they are escaping! Quickly... over there! Get them! They got away! No! Fool! Justice having fail troll, it's time to set you loose again. This time, it's the Beast. I know! I know... he's stronger than you and almost as ugly! But... would you like some of these, hmm? Well, you'll get some once you've got him for me. And I'm going to give you a little help. Do you know what this is, troll? This... turns living beings into stone. And here's the perfect way of providing the Beast with the required dose. Now that the mixture's on the dagger all you've to do... is stick it in. You are not too afraid of him to do that, are you? Good! Now go into the forest and hunt him down. Ooh, and troll... if the girl is with him, and you're in the mood, feel free to break her head off. Go! You came back for me. - Of course I did. - Why? I guess I thought it was the right thing to do. - They could have killed you. - It was still the right thing to do. - And also... - Yes? ... because I care about you. We need to search for Otto. - I know. But that's not the first thing. - What? We've to get to the heart of this. Where it all began, who it began with. - The sorceress! - Exactly. - I am afraid. - What? I am ashamed to say it, but I still fear her name. You should be angry, furious. She destroyed your life. Anger, yes. I feel anger. But she made me as I am. I fear what her magic could do to me. So, you've to destroy her. - Can she be destroyed? - I don't know. But if she isn't, then she and Count Rudolph... will have this country in the palm of their hand. What does that matter to me? You think the people would take me as their king? No. Probably not. - Then why should I do it? - Because it's the right thing to do. And because I hope that you care for this land and the people in it. The people who shunned me? The people who spat at me? The people who wanted to kill me? Yes, those people. The frighten people, the ignorant people... and also the good people. People like Otto, people like my mother! They need someone to stand up for them. - Against the sorceress? - Against the sorceress. - You ask a lot, Belle. - And you have a lot to... No! Are you alright? Yes... yes. He didn't touch me. - And I've decided something. - Yes? The witch must die! You look like a real hunter. - A witch hunter. - A monster hunter! Sorry, I wasn't thinkinig. But the troll is a monster; and you weren't. - I just look like a monster. - Not to me. And besides, what makes a monster is the soul, not the hide. So you and I are real monster hunters. You are not thinking of coming with me? If we go hunting, my friend, we go together. What? You jibbering stupid fool. I gave you the most powerful magic I possessed. I gave you the best dagger ever made, and you failed?! I ought to put you in the cauldron from which you came. Get in the cage... go! You haven't earn it, so you don't get it. No! No more until I said so. And should something happens to me, no one in the world knows how to make more. Get in the cage! You'll be back sooner or later. You'd do anything for a drop of that. Now, for that damn Beast. Smoke? Welcome to the killing zone, Beast. I called on Ahura Mazda, God of the Storm! Damn your eyes... Perhaps literally! Wait till this hit you. You've come here to kill me, I suppose. No one deserves to die more than you do. I'm sure you're right, but considered one thing before you shoot. - What's that? - I made you what you are. Which is just one reason why you should die. And the whole reason why I should live... Because only I know how to turn you back. If you kill me, you'll stay a Beast forever. Spare me and I'll turn you back into the prince you really are. Now, isn't that a wonderful bargain. - You are evil! - Quite true, but... ... you see this? This came from your head, when you were still human. I used them against you, and I also used them to give life to my troll. Your life. And only I can take it from him and give it back to you. Only you? You need me, Beast. This country needs me. With my power and your strength, we could rule it together. Show you could do it. Changed me back into what I am. - All in good time, dear boy. - Now! You can't threaten me. Not if you want my help...Max. Max? Oh, that's what your father would have call you. After himself, Maximilian the XIV... before he got obliged to abandon you. Turn me back now or you die. I'm sorry, I don't respond well to threats. In fact... I hate it! Nobody tells Helena of Augsburg what to do! No! What a perfect morning this has become. I get to kill the Beast and slit the throat of his beloved all in one morning! How dare you? - You killed her for me. - There was no choice. You could have let me die. You could have forced her to change you back. If you're dead, I would have no reason to go on. Do you really mean it? Lie down. Oh God! Oh... There must be something here that can help you. Yes! Please! Please! Oh... thank God! He's taking over. What? - Count Rudolph.. he's got the troll. - I loved it! He's going to make himself the new king. What has that to do with me? Everything! You are the rightful heir. I would have been if I hadn't killed the witch. You still are, no matter what you look like. If Count Rudolph takes over with that monster by his side... - ... this place could turn to hell. - Belle, everybody hate's me! And there's only two of us. Three of us. Don't forget me. - Otto! - You came! Well, doesn't looks like you needed me. There must be something useful we could take from here. We need to formulate a plan to announce to see who's going to take over this kingdom. That's enough. Quiet, all of you. Listen to me. And why should we listen to you, Rudolph? Because we've to select a new king. - We've to listen to each other. - To you, you mean. It's an excellent start. After all, it was I that caught the famous Beast of the forest. - Oh... and let it escaped again. - That's not fair! - Witchcraft was involved. - Ha... witchcraft? And aren't you surprisingly friendly with that famous witch, Helen of Augsburg? We're not having a witch friend for a king. So pipe down Rudolph, and get down from there. Yes, it's true. I'm friend with Lady Helen of Augsburg. In fact she gave me a gift. A wonderful gift. Well... take it home and played with it, Rudi. Uncovered it! Now... it would be much more generous of me if I let it play with you. You see, there was a time this creature... only answered to Lady Helena of Augsburg. But now she's transferred his affection to me. Shut it! Shut the door at once. Pick one of them... kill them. Just one! Then have some more of this. We won't be intimidated by some goblin. We are all armed. My little red friend isn't afraid of your swords. Attack him! Wonderful demonstration, don't you agree? How about a small round of applause? Nothing? Duke Henry... you wouldn't want to hurt my creature feelings, would you? Back in the cage. Gentlemen! Nobles... It's time for us to choose a new king. Excellent work! I'm aware they're a few of us equally qualified, by rank and by blood, for the title of the king. But in view of my recent contributions to the country safety, I would like to put my name forward first. I'm going to ask each and everyone of you one by one if you'll support mine becoming the next king, starting with you, Duke Henry. Do I have your support? Yes, cousin Rudolph. I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Yes, cousin Rudolph. The rest of you... do I have your support? - Yes, my lord. - Yes, Count. - Yes, Count. - Of course. - Yes - Yes, my lord. Well, I am honored and surprised by this very unexpected nomination. - I accept! - Begging your pardon, Count! Sheriff Otto captured the Beast and the girl. Bring it here! Bring them to kneel before the new King so he may administered his justice. Well done, your Majesty. Well done for bringing such a monster to justice. - Well, somebody had to do it. - And it had to be you, didn't it? Because you were determined to condemn me... for the crimes commited by that monster there! I don't know what you're talking about. Someboy, take him away. Not until we're finish, Count! Somebody seized him! Get him! It appears as if the Count has been using the witches spawn... to intimidate you. But the truth is, there's no need for any king choosing at all. You see before you the rightful heir to the throne. - How can that be possible? - Are you mad, Beast? No, I am Maximilian the XIV, son of Maximilian XIII... transformed at birth into a monster by the sorceress Helena of Augsburg, left to die in the forest. And rescued by this man, who many of you will recognised as once having worked as a groom in the palace. It's the truth, your honor's. This is the child the good Queen died giving birth to. And this, is the royal cup that was sent away with me. Who in the world do you think is going to believe such a foolish story. Anyone who denied for the truth, Rudolph. Anyone who knows you, as a cruel grasping Lucifer that you are. Someone like me, for example. You forget the troll, my friend. The troll is afraid of me, Rudolph. Almost as much as you are. You see, it was my humanity the sorceress used... to give life to that thing. And heaven knows I'm determined to get it back! Don't leave her, he won't harm her. But only if you renounced any claims you've to the throne. Isn't that right, troll? All you've to do, is say the stories are lies. Leave this land and never return. Say it! Say it... and the troll will let her go. No! Please! Say it's not true! No! Remember me! Please! - Forget about me! - Say it! I'll do as you asked. I hereby renounced... - I hereby renounced all claims... - The hell you do! Guards! I proclaim the start of the reign of a new monarch... Maximilian the XIV! And I promise to rule in the name of... and for the good of every men, women and child in this land. He did exactly what he promised. As long as that couple ruled, there was peace, there was prosperity... and there was also two very unusual statues, just to remind people, how lucky they were.
