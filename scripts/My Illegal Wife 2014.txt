Ginny, for a man she'll never have... and you, for a man you've tricked into a big lie. Wait now. You act as if you're part of the movie. But really, I feel guilty. But really, I feel guilty. Should I cancel the wedding? While there's still time! Go! Do it! But it's hard. My family loves him now. I love him. Does he love you? Does he love you? He said so. What if his memory comes back? Will he still love you? I don't know. If I were you, I'd put an end to this right now. Explain to him everything. He deserves an explanation. Why did you cancel the wedding? I deserve an explanation. I deserve an explanation. I deserve an acceptable reason. Have pity on him, and your family. You're fooling all of them... and yourself too. Agree.

Let's bring him to the hospital! Nurse! Hurry! Henry! Clarise, we'll go now. We will get back again, A-S-A-P. A-S-A-F. Come on, bro. Us too, Girl. We'll just come back. Can you take the kids home?

How have you been? - How are you? Fine. Are you his...? Yes, I'm his wife. Really? Let's sit down. Friend, do you know about this? What are these? They're pieces of 24-karat rare gold we recovered from your husband's stomach. They were implanted so deeply that's why they were unnoticeable. Is your husband a gold mule? Hubby, I hope you still have amnesia. Hubby... Hubby? How are you feeling? Are you okay? I'm fine. Hubby... they found these inside your stomach. What do you know about these gold? Nothing. Wait... wait. Im so sorry. I didn't know that you're here, there, and everywhere. Are you all right, hubby? Hubby? We're married? Yes. Don't you remember? I remember. I remember everything. I know you! I know you! You're the woman on the airplane! What did you do to me? - What-- - Henry! Bro! Henry, what's happening? Henry, I'm your wife! You are not my wife! And you will never be my wife! You made me believe we're married? Yes! That we got married. That we were in love. - How dare you! - Bro! - You're a witch! - Don't bother yourself! You took advantage of me! What kind of person are you? - I hope you forgive me, Henry. - Never! Yes, I lied to you. But I really loved you. Didn't you love me at all? Girl, what's happening? Hen!- Get out! I never want to see your face again! Did you hear that? What are you waiting for'? Get out! Girl, you have to accept that he's gone. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Mama, what happened? Is Papa Henry dead? There's no Papa Henry... there is no real Papa Henry. Walling? My child! How? Why'? WOW! From walling to... flooring?! He had amnesia. I made him believe we were married. From flooring to... sofa-ing? Crying. I wanted him... to be the one. The husband I've been looking for. Though it was just pretense, I truly loved him. I truly loved him. Mama, don't cry. Be strong, Mama. Mama. Please forgive your Mama. - My child! - Forgive me. Forgive me. That Clarise is one heck of a person! Yeah! That girl, what she did to you... I can't remember the words I think it's... hug-hug, yug-yug, Iek-lek! What? Oh, I remember the words - Stinking bomb. That girl is a stinking bomb! She did to you what she did you! She-- Who's there? I think that's Clarise. She wanna talk to you. She wanna be with you again. She'll see. Surprise, Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! I love you babe! Babe, take a seat. Babe, how are you? What is this? What happened to you? Babe, I just had surgery. What? Where's the gold? Babe, the gold? Where's the gold? You made me a... gold mule? Babe, wait. Let me explain! Please. What's happening to the Clarise name? Is that user- friendly? Yes. Users! I only did that for our future. Babe, please forgive me. Babe. I was just surprised. Babe, k understand. But we have to get those gold back. Where are those? It's with Clarise. Me? No. Clarise with the s. Whoever she is... we have to get them back from her. No. Why'? I said no. There is no other way. Those gold are rare. You're asking too much from me. How should I do that? Why don't you make her fall in love with you again? - Right. - Shocker! Babe, if that's the only way... please do it. I don't want to lie to anyone. Even if she lied to me. I don't want to involve her family. How should I pursue her? In the catering business, you'll have full stomachs and pockets. This is good business. Let's try this! Maybe we shouldn't. Come on! It will take your mind off things-. So you don't wallow in pain at home... and you forget about Henry. But I can't stop thinking of him. What if we meet again? What if I shove your face down the food? A Christmas carrol? Isn't it too early? When he first met you, he loves you dearly! Oh Clarise! He loves you dearly! You have it all... AN! AH! You have it all... AN! AH! Break it down! Yo! Chichay! I mean, Clarise. For all that I've done... I'm sorry! Why are you apologizing? Shouldn't it be the other way around? Have you forgiven me? Yes, and I'd like us to start over. Even if... there was never an us? Yes. I hope we have one more chance. If Popoy and Basha had one more chance... Who am I to deny you that? Big mouth. What? How does it taste? Delicious! Are you stuplish? Stu plish? Stupid and foolish! My child, don't punish yourself. Ma, this is not punishment. This is called another chance to love. I know I've said many hurtful words. Sorry is not enough. So please, let me make it up to Clarise. You have to deal with us first! Pa... I mean Mister Henry, we have a Family Day at school tomorrow. Can you pretend to be my Papa? Sure. Next week, I'll be 9 years old! Can you arrange the party? I will. This is a gentleman's agreement. And don't hurt Mama again... or else, you'll get hurt! Understood? Okay. Very good. I still can't believe it. It's like I hit gold when I found you. - Wifey... - Yes? Are the gold still with you? Yes. Really? Where are they? I want to see them. I forgot. So that's why you have rock-hard abs. You're hiding something. So where? Don't worry, they're just there. Let's look for them. How did they get inside your stomach? I have to rest now. I'm tired. Sure, take a rest now. So you'll have more energy tomorrow. I hope this lasts. You know, Liam just pretends to be a toughie. Next to me, he was the one who missed you the most. (Crowd Cheering) Go! Go! Go! There you go, team green is leading. Blue team, hurry up. Orange team, hurry up. Fight! Fight! Fight! Children, let's look for a spot. Mama, is Grandma Magda coming? No. She'll just be stressed here. Wait. Where's your husband? Why isn't he here yet? He forgot something at home. Really now?! Has he amnesia again? You're overreacting. Because you're not reacting. He has to be here. Because this shirt and Liam are waiting for him. He might miss the whole family day. He promised to come. Don't worry, I'll get him. I'll be back. Wait for Mama. Please watch over them. Babe... - Hello? - did you find the gold? No, I'm looking for them now. Hurry up, Babe. When you find them I'll give you a reward. What? Hubby-- - Babe? Babe? - I can't find them, Babe. Babe? What's happening? What are you looking for? Who are you talking to? It's Bryan. I'm asking for help to look for something. Why do you have to turn this place upside down? What is it, anyway? The gold. The secret to your rock-hard abs? I'm not sure, maybe they were thrown away. What? ! That can't be! Cannot be! - Cannot be! - Ouch! I'm not a rag doll. - Cannot be! - Ouch! Ouch! - Cannot be! - Ouch! Ouch! You've shaken my small brain too much! Sorry. Sorry. I lost control. I'm just curious. I want to see them. Where are they? Are you hiding something from me, hubby?! Are you hiding something from me, hubby?! Are you hiding something from me, hubby?! Nothing. Forget it. Let's go to Liam then. Right, I forgot about him. - Let's go. - Come on. Wait. I think you need to make it up to Liam. Hazel: We're going home already. Liam is upset. I think you need to make it up to Liam. Why didn't you show up? I thought you're a showman. Enough. Clarise, I'm pissed! He promised to attend the Family Day as Liam's father... what happened? I was the one there instead of you. Aren't you part of the family? You're right. Come on, let's eat. Your Papa Henry prepared this meal. Let's eat. I'm not hungry. Me, mo. Me, mo. But if you have leftovers, I'm just there. Liam... please forgive me. I'm sorry. Don't fail me again on my birthday. Pa... Mister Henry. - Papa, don't leave me. - I'm not leaving Liam again. Like how my father left me. Good thing I was adopted by Bro Anjo and Bryan's parents. I hate him so much! I'll never forget what he did. If you see him again, will you forgive him? No! HefY- SOFT)'- You cannot be a father if you can't resolve your issues. It's difficult, but you have to forgive him. Clarise, not all problems can be solved by forgiveness! That's not true! I wanted to give this to you earlier. Here. Our teacher asked us to make it... for a family member I want to forgive. She said, A family that forgives is a family that loves. When you came back, I was mad but I easily forgave you. Because we are family. Papa Henry. H' the gold aren't with me by tomorrow night... I will have you taken care of. Understood? Yes, Madam. Boys, put the pork in the barrel. Yes, Madam! Babe... Babe... Babe, have you found the gold yet? Not yet. What? ! What's taking you so long? Babe, I'm always with Clarise. I can't find the chance to look for them. You better hurry up! Do I have to remind you how important those gold are to me? That's all that matters to you? Is that why you searched for me? Babe. Of course not. I looked for you because I need you. And I love you! But I'm worried about our jewelry business.--... because a lot of people know that the gold is here. Don't be mad. Please? I love you, Babe. I love you, Babe. I love you, Babe. Everything's ready! Are you happy now? We! BMW Mama. Happy birthday! What got into you? Why did you decorate everything in gold? Gold is lucky. Okay. Where's the mascot? Didn't you call one? - Hello! - There it is! - Hello! Hi! - Hi! - Happy birthday, Baby! - Thank you. - Happy birthday, Liam. - Thank you. Don't I look nice? It goes with the motif... - Golden. - Buddha? Retriever. It's buldging. What? Your tummy. Mama! Mama! Yes? What are these? Grandma found these in your wedding gown. Those belong to your Papa Henry's. Good thing you found them. Here. Mama, what's that? These are gold. Keep them. Give them to Papa Henry when he gets here. - Okay. - Sister, may I borrow? Where is Henry? He prepared the food but he's not here. He's the only one missing! He's coming, just calm down. Okay, I will. Who is Clarise Zabaldica? Not them! Not him, not her and certainly not her. Probably me. It's me. Why? Give me the gold now! Gold? Oh, what gold? You want gold? Take this Golden Retriever. It's all gold. Hey! And who are you, stinking woman, to barge in like this? Right! That is just the start! Next time it will be this. Well, since you don't know me yet... let me introduce myself. I am Clarize, with a z not with ans. I am Henry's fiance. What? My husbands fiancee? Your husband? Who are you kidding? Oh, please... I am the one and only Henry's legal wife-to-be! And that makes you the illegal wile wannabe! Legal wife? How did you seduce him? What did you take off first? Your bra, your panty... or your conscience? You want war? You want war? Empty words, Clarize! Empty words! I don't want to talk to you! Can't you accept that Henry's mine now?! Henry's mine! He's mine! He's mine! He's not yours, Nicole! He's mine! My husbands mine! I'm not Nicole! I'm Clarise! Stupid! Speechless? That happens when you get slapped by the truth. How? We've been together for a long time... back in Japan... before he had amnesia... and before you pretended to be his wife. Henry is just here for you because of the gold. He made you believe he loves you to get the gold back. No! That's a lie! It's true! But apparently, he can't do the job quickly. So I'm here to do the job. So where is the gold now before I make my move'? - What's that you're holding? - Nothing. Hey! Let go of my son! Let go! What are you doing to my grandson? - Liam! - Liam! Liam! - Liam! - Here's the gold. Liam! - Ruthless people! - Let's go! Liam, my child? Liam! Liam! Are you done? We are just facking it. That didn't sound right. It's a p not an f! Blogger! Enough. Hurry now, Liam may get mad at me again. When did you become concerned? Is he your son? He's like a son to me. Bravo! Bravo! That was the first time I've ever heard you speak a complete English... not buckling yourself. Crazy! But you know, Bro. I feel guilty about what I'm doing to Clarise. After everything... they accepted me as part of the family. And Clarise feels sorry too. I want to stop this now. Whatcha gonna do? I'm going to talk to Clarise and tell her the truth... so her family will be spared. And then I will talk to Clarize... - With the-- - with a z. Sure. Let's go. Clarize: I attacked her family and got the gold back. Yahoo! Oh, no! What! Hey Bro! What about this? You pack it up! Oh, come on! Maid. Clarise, I came from our house. How dare you show up after everything that happened! Clarise-- I already know the truth! You lied to me for those freakin' gold! So get out! You bastard! Clarise, I'm sorry. Yams s W Can your sorry take back all the lies you made to my family? Can your sorry take back what happened to my son? Clarise, forgive me-- But come to think of it, I have no right to get mad at you... because I also lied to you. What hurts the most is that... I convinced myself that someone like you could love me back. Cora was right. I am stuplish. Stupid and foolish to believe. This is what I got from watching romance movies. All those stories I told you when you had amnesia... were from all my favorite scenes. Because I thought they could happen in real lite. To us. Even if we are not compatible. Even if our looks and ages don't match. Let's get real, I found gold in you. Maybe that's life. I will never find someone who'll truly love me. Clarise, I loved you. That's the truth. There was never an us. There will never be an us. So please, stop flirting with me. Bro, are you okay? It's Clarize! You're right! Where is Clarize going? - To Madam. - Who's Madam? A slaughterhouse owner. ' Bro! ' Bro! Call the police! I'll get Anjo! Okay, bro. And you, stay here! Good pork. Another good pork. Madam. What, Clarize? It's all good, Madam. Very good! Finally, we have all the missing pieces. The key to proving that I'm the queen of the black market. Clarize... you know what to do with the mule. And to the woman... with the same name as yours. Get rid of them. I certainly will, Madam. - Babe, what is this all about? - Stay there! - Who are they? - Stay there. Madam... meet my mule. Is this why you sponsored me in Japan? To be your mule? You treated me like... like... A Piggy bank! A Piggy bank! And not only that! I was also the mastermind of your accident... so we could put the gold inside you! I'm so brainy, right? That's why when you went missing, I got worried because... you can't be found. You were protected by your amnesia. So, I had to step up. I had to track you down. And I tracked you down! Clarize, why-- How could you do this to me? You said you loved me? Well... surprise! I lied! Enough of this drama! Get rid of them! Arrest them! You! Me?! Madam, you're under arrest! I have the right to an attorney! Do you have one? None. What do you know? Nothing. I'm glad you're out of the hospital. Yes. How's my grandson? I'm okay grandma. My daughter... Ma, I'm sorry. This is all my fault. But you didn't want to put us in danger. But because of my desire to have a husband... this happened. At first, I only wanted a father for my children whom they can count on. But when I met Henry... I asked myself... Is this really what you want? A father for your family? What was your answer? My answer was... Stop pretending. Because what I really needed... what I really wanted... was a husband. A husband that will love me forever. Even if I'm already old... he will never forget to love me. That's what's wrong with you. Because of you're desire to be loved by a man. You forgot... that we're just here. I know that, sis. I was wrong to think, that I am loved enough. When your love is more than enough. I made myself believe that we need a man in this family. But the truth is, we can stand on our own. We can be happy by ourselves. So there... you had an amnesia, not in you're mind but in your heart. Sorry, Ma. Sorry. Sorry, sis. Thank you. We're just here for you mama... we'll always take care of you. We love you very much Ma. He's right. Don't be sad. - What is that? What? - I know what to do. Everybody follow me. Everybody follow him. One... IWO... one, two, three, huh! One... - TWO... - Just like that! One, two, three, huh! Look at your sweat, enough to water rice fields. You're exaggerating. Incredible Henry! Jerks'.! Who's your love? Who's your mama'? Tell me-- Your Mom was amazed to me. I love you, wifey. I love you. How is he? He's been suffering from Alzheimers. He loses his temper whenever he has to process new information. You have a visitor, Sir. Young man, who are you? You don't remember me? I'm Henry. Your son. Yams my S an.) MY Son? Kid, don't fool me. My son is still young! You have the same name, but you're not him. This one is my son. He looks handsome just like me? Sorry, my child. Papa left you. Why did you-- Why did you leave Henry? Nothing. That's it? Nothing? I loved my son. But I couldn't give him a good life. Though it hurts, to leave him, I still had to. For his future. If you really love him, why didn't you come back for him? I tried... but I couldn't remember where to find him. I didn't know where to look. I just woke up and it's gone! Gone! MY memory's gone! I didn't know who I was. I don't know! So you, young man... don't leave the people you love. Especially your family. Don't ever forget them. Especially here. Me... even if I don't remember him here... I know that right here... I will never forget that I love him. I just hope... that it's not too late for me and my son. It's never to late. Papa... Papa? Papa for real? Alright! You're my son now! My child! Mama. My daughter... are you sure about this? Yes, Mama. I want to take advantage of the chance to go back to Japan. - Okay, take care. - Mama... you don't have to send me off, we'll just be bawling there. My make-up will ruin. All right. Take care! Yes, I promise! Okay. - My children... - Mama. I hope you understand Mama. This is for us. Yes Mama, we understand. Please take care. Yes. You look after your sibling. Yes, Mama. I can take care of myself mama... I'm strong now. I'll look after grandma and big sister, too. Thank you, baby. Let's go. Hey Clarise, don't tell me you'll have a sequel to your Henry Acuesta experience! Enough of that already! But if you do find a man, send him to me! You're such a flirt. I won't be a fool anymore. Really?! But what if you see him again? Then so be it. Why does my heart beat fast Every time I see your face? Will you ever notice me'? Who are these? Times we bumped into each other - You even picked the books I dropped - Cops! Arrest those rugby boys. - Still, you didn't notice me - What's this, sister? - Do you know anything about this? - Nothing! Every day I follow you I'm shocked. - But you don't notice me at all - How beautiful? - What must I do? - This is familiar to me. I know I've seen this. Cora, you have something to do with this! - Why do you look away? - What's this? - Don't my legs look nice? - Oh, see. - I just want you to know me - And she wore a costume! Now that's something! - Here in my heart - You're it! Look at this one. The eyes are tantalizing! - There's a space for you - isn't it cute? So cute! - Okay, here comes. - May I get to know you? I'll send to the house. Every day I follow you You don't notice me at all - What must I do? - I like it. I like it! This is really fun! Is it fiesta yet? What's this? I don't know! When When will you notice - It's beautiful! - The secret Im keeping No marker what I do - You don? notice me. - I remember. This is from It Takes A Man and A Woman! We saw this! When When will you notice my long hidden desire No marker what I do You still don't notice me Everybody! Wait! If this is a scene from the movie, then is Miggy coming?! Oh, my God, Miggy! Here in my heart A special space only for you May I get to know you? Clarise... I want to ask forgiveness from all of you. Especially to Liam. I hope you can forgive me. And to you Clarise, I hope you give me a second chance. What's this new gimmick? Didn't you like my take on John Lloyd Cruz? I can do a Xian Lim? Enrique Gil, perhaps? Or Daniel Padilla? What? Anything! Stop giving me false hopes. Let's stop hurting each other anymore. That's why I'm doing this, to stop myself from hurting. I want you to know how I feel. And I want you to know you're the only one in my heart. But I'm not the Clarise you loved. Clarise, I asking for your forgiveness. I will forever regret all the wrong I did to you. Clarise, I love you so much. But why? Why'? Why me? There are a lot of girls out there. Like her! You're the only one. You're the only one who made me feel what true love is. No matter how many times this suffers amnesia. Here, I will never forget to love you. Clarise Zabaldica... wifey... will you allow me again to be your husband? Wait, I'll have to think about it, this is so sudden. Don't think twice, Clarise! Get him or others will! Or I will! All right, yes! Group hug! Before, this was lust an imagination. But now ifs real. Finally! I'm getting married! Thank you very much, Lord! Who would have thought I'd get married to someone like Henry'? Wait... am I imagining again?

In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God... and the communion of the Holy Spirit will be with you all. And with your spirit. And now I pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride. Long live the newlyweds! Long live! Mother of God! Subtitle by: Orestis-05
