All citizens must surrender their radios. - A radio, does it? - Upstairs in the living room! Take it. You have many nice watches here. Bavarian? The box appears to be Style Berringer. Yes, 1886. Well you know ... watches? My father is a watchmaker. I grew up under his desk. And look what it became. - What city? - Mattenbraw. Mattenbraw ... Mattenbraw, 1895. - Splendid. - You should have seen the state ... when he arrived here. The way some people treat a clock without care ... without ... understanding. It was a gift in my 70th birthday. "When Grandpa Ten Boom Children of Haarlem. March 26, 1935. " Give him the speaker. - Over any radio in the house? - No, no. Good day then. JEWS ARE NOT WELCOME FORBIDDEN TO JEWS Quena not anything too expensive, understand? Then there's one here ... seven rubies, manufacturing whisker, but all the craftsmen are German immigrants. It costs 42 guilders. It's a birthday present. I spend a little more. Well, we have this ... Bamendor style. Excuse me. Daddy, is leaving? I will not be hanging around this house doing nothing. Dad? Excuse me ... Sorry. Yes .. See ... you can have notched Io ... or you can order in Io ... white gold. The white gold costs 60. ... residents in occupied Holland must present themselves as the following rules. - Someone is considered Jewish ... - Take your star. Or partly Jewish if ... - Next. At least one grandparent of Jewish origin. A grandparent is considered Jewish one belongs or has belonged a synagogue. You should not be here. I came for my star. They are for the Jews. You do not have a "J" in his identity card. You could get it for me. If they do not we use all know the difference between ... a Gentile and a Jew. Go home, please. Go home. I will use my star! And I will not take it until God says I should take it! The God of Abraham and Isaac ... and my God, too! Leader who? Come on, hurry. Let's go there! Good day ... Not Miss. Ten Boom? Children, stop. The watch? Ten Boom, street Berteljorisstraat! You took our radio. I wrote to my father. - I told him about his shop. - Who are these guys? Why do not prevent to disturb the man? They are young Dutch patriots. They say he made derogatory remarks the Reich and our Fuehrer. Are expressing their outrage. Patriots? Who are these kids? They are my students. Talk to them about God. At least that's what I did. This will be the Iast class. Through the new orders on unauthorized meetings. Mlle. Ten Boom ... the measures are temporary. When all this has passed and order is restored, then all will live together Aryans as our brothers in the Reich. Men live together as brothers only in the kingdom of our Lord. Nowhere. Can we go? Come ... yes. Children ... Children ... Come on! Come on! Grab some cookies. Yes .. Jan always comes running for the wafers. Lisa, yes. Carol ... ah, yes! Ha! Biscuits? I can not then be with you for a while. But Jesus is still here ... always looking out for you. See ... without Jesus, we are thus. Empty! We can not do anything. But when Jesus fills us with ... with His love, then we complete. Yes! We can do anything. We can do anything. Nothing serious, pastor. Maybe just a bit dirty. He is delaying 5 seconds per day. Maybe a good cleaning solved. You can do it now? While I'm here ... really would be great. Sure! Great! I'll go up and talk with his Father I heard he is wearing a Jewish star. Stubbornness is the daughter of pride, and pride is the first of the seven deadly sins. I'll talk to him about it. I need to be back to the church at 1:30. Will be ready. Dr. Heemstra! Mlle. Ten Boom. I can only stay a moment. We need milk for him, no soup. Good heavens, I hope not intend to stay with him! But they can not! It's illegal! You may all be arrested! He's gorgeous. Pastor ... You were sent by God! Do you live in the countryside! Nothing could be safer! This is ... impossible. I have my family to look after. We could lose everything because of this child. What would my church without a shepherd? - Ah, but ... - No, Betsie! The minister has decided. It's the law! And Christians should obey the law! Think of the risk they are running, because of a Jewish baby. Will give us away, pastor, if the baby gets for a time with us? Corrie ... must obey the state law if it is not against the higher law of God. Pastor, you want I no longer wear the star. Okay, do not I will. But we are left with the baby. As a Christian ... I regret that any Man has to suffer; no matter who or their race. - But remember, are the Jews ... - Who gave us the Bible ... and our Savior! Be as you wish. I take my watch tomorrow. Good Morning, Ten Boom. Ladies. God forgive him. He had no bad intention. How can he to give the title of a Christian? Living in a cookie jar does not make a mouse a wafer. What do we do? - We need milk! - He has to go to the field. Beware, it will choke him up. - Where will send him? - Only God knows. The doors are opening throughout the Netherlands. Last week a farmer and a Baroness slept in the same bed. And now you have a little Moses in a basket. Corrie, please. Thanks. - Willem! - He can not cry! - You are very organized. - Oh, is not the first time. We helped in the escape of Jews ... for a day or a week. He hid it from us, Willem? Before they were German Jews, and now the Dutch. We do what we can. The Nazis only happy when there are no Jews in Europe. They hurt the girl's eyes of God. I have for them. - I hate them. - Ah, Corrie ... You can not hate someone and walk with the Lord. You could have told us, Willem, we would have helped. The most important thing is to take our little friend here. It would be hard to explain this sudden gift of heaven. Son, I'll walk with you a little. Goodbye, Moses. We're doing well. Sometimes we have some potatoes ... and occasionally even eggs! So far we have not been bad. And of course ... - This is a peasant? - Grandpa! Kik, you got anything? The carbon in the waste basket, Io if you hold the light, can see. Thanks. See, Papa ... - We have a contact in the Gestapo ... - Quiet! It provides us with deportation lists whenever he can. Alright, Kik? Bye, Grandpa. - God bless you, Kik. - Hold tight to the hand ... good! Pope ... Now every day ... they are sending 400 Jews Central Station in Amsterdam. Help those who can. We know someone on the list? - Sorry. - No, please ... sorry ... for disturbing Ios. Maybe he ... Dad ... There is a gentleman up there. We met. - Well, it was too late ... - He had nowhere to go. Daddy, he is a teacher. Willem studied with him. They closed the university. All Jewish teachers were forced ... Ah, Betsie ... Good morning again, professor. I apologize for the intrusion, Mr. Ten Boom. Please ... Thanks. Professor ... Give us the honor praying thanking? Blessed art thou ... O Lord our God, you give us the bread of earth. Amen Amen How lucky that Aunt Bep had large feet. Is. E. .. what is your date of birth? Birth? August 19, 1885. Name of the Father? Casper Ten Boom. Mother? Cornelia Ten Boom. Her maiden name? Mlle. Ten Boom ... If we stopped, I ... I could never I pass you by. Professor Ziener ... There is no "if" in God's world. He brought this house; and you will see that depart in safety. This is where we turn, teacher. Stay close to me. I'll try. Well done, professor! We're almost there. - Katrien! - Tia Corrie! - Tia Corrie! - Katrien! I need help from his father. You should have seen the teacher Ziener entering the boat. Katrien's father as if he were helping Queen Willemina entering the yacht! Cornelia, do you think is having too much fun with this? Me having fun? No, I was terrified. Except when kept to laugh at him dressed as Betsie ... Thank God. He kept away from the patrols. Remember to save a piece cake for a friend of Willem. Friend? It's all very mysterious. Is anyone he wants we know. What you said when Willem Professor Ziener told him? This is not a joke to when they want to have fun. If you get involved this work people have to entrust their lives to you! I told you, Willem. We gave him my documents. We plan everything very carefully. And if they questioned the ... Does he sing soprano? No! He had a ... sore throat. Excuse me. But you walk around picking people at random? How did they know they could trust him? I knew him. And he knew what the Lord told me. Pope ... You're the boss of this house. The head of this house ... orders that the door is opened anyone to beat. We can not afford to skip to anybody to engage seriously in this work, regardless of their methods. Perhaps allow us to ... help with this. Thanks for the delivery, Mr. Smit. Only for emergencies! We have a contact in the phone, but you never know if the line is not bugged. We hope to develop their own sources. The less contact have me, or any other ... better. Willem, know half of Haarlem. We have friends everywhere! My dear, Ios know it's something ... - Know their political stances ... - God knows! And ask Him to guide us. We understand your concern, Mr. Sluring. We are not the perfect candidate. But since there is a need, should do everything possible to service it. People have the most varied reasons want to work secretly, emotion, perhaps. Mr. Sluring, have passed the age at which the emotion was important in our lives. Actually ... rather do anything else. I wish to close the door and not open it anymore. Until all this horror has ended. But that's me. My Lord Jesus ... says to open the door for anyone who comes. Share His love the way I can. And I will listen to his voice ... and not mine. We passed the inspection? How can you get? We ... Mom's room, your old room Aunt Anna's room, Bep aunt's room and our 3 / 4 ... are 7. We can sleep in the same bed if necessary. So, our hotel is ready for guests. Not yet. What will the Gestapo appear? You will receive a visit Jan Smit. There are actually two houses. For over 100 years they were joined. The front has 2 rooms a long and wide. The back, here ... has 3 bedrooms. On top of one another. Pope, this is Mr. Smit. Mr. Smit. I know some Smits in Amsterdam. And the family that Smit ... Father, this is the man I told you about. He came to inspect the house. A building inspector? It's yours office Grote Street in the Hous? No, Papa, he is not building inspector, and his name is Smit. - Not Smit? - Excuse me, Papa. We have to see the rest of the house. The living room ... Mealtime ... is preferred for a hit. Beware the dumps ... and ashtrays. We need a place the highest possible. Increases the chances of escape to a place safe while looking down. - These are all rooms? - Yes. If there is a night raid, will have to take their bedding, and can not forget to flip the mattress. The favorite trick of the Gestapo is feeling the heat of the bed. What's up there? The roof is just above. Who sleeps here? I sleep. Perfect! The wall ... will be ... here! Alright! The sign is in the window. You see, There is a different brand, we can always recognize a Flenstadht. What a beautiful day, Aunt Betsie. Peter, no! - I turn to look on Tuesday, then. - Good Mlle. Ten Boom! Frisian! That beautiful wood! My father has already made a box like that. Ah, he spent months riding polishing, varnishing. But it's just a case ... we need to put inside a machine. How much will it cost? Well, it'll take months to assemble Io. Name your price. Steep until I paid. I liked the clock. - Can I afford the best! - But ... not have machine! None. Very good. Tuesday, Mr. Ten Boom. Kik! Quick! Aunt Betsie, how many times I have to tell you? Take the sign of the window when it is not safe! Kik ... Sorry. Sorry! Grandpa ... just look! Tea, Mr. Smit? Ah, thank you! Yes, yes, yes, yes! - Good morning. - Milk! No milk! Ink! Ink? Betsie! Betsie! Remember Fred Koonstra? Sure, it made reading our clock by light years. Her daughter was our student. - Milk! - Ink. Ink! Elsie Koonstra. I know her name, I'm trying remember some faces. She must have some twenties now. Yesterday I learned that Fred works Koonstra the department of nutrition. Where? Where to send ration coupons. I'll be frank. We had unexpected visitors. First, a baby ... then a man, and last night a couple. All Jews, Mr. Koonstra. Why do I say that? Remains only 3 of us home now. My father, my sister and me. And our ration coupons are not sufficient. All coupons are conferred. Are checked in several ways. Yes! Yes! I know. I should not have asked for. I thought maybe you could help me. The office in Utrecht was stolen last week. - The men were caught. - And dead. If it had been at noon, when just me and another employee are there ... We would have to be tied and gagged. How many coupons do you need? Hundred! I know someone you can achieve. Pope, now! Papa! - Ready. - How long? 47 / 2! It is better not to send nobody bigger than me. Hallelujah! Our Lord, we ask Thy blessing on this secret hideaway. Eat what you want! - Herren, is not kosher. - Do not worry. Could you pass the potatoes, please? My God! Go, go, go! Go! Quick, quick. One in the head, another on the other hand, and one on each side. You're spilling! Corrie? A minute and 15 seconds. That's long enough to wrap the stomach. Peace be to this house and all that dwell therein. - The peace of the Lord God ... - Come in, do not get out there praying. I hear you have accommodations. I need a room for me quiet to study, preferably without children. Well, can I stay? Well, yes, I think so, but there are many questions ... I would eat something. My meal was Iast Sunday. Thanks! At noon. This house is kosher? Well, we tried, we have many requests we can not answer. And no children? Well, not at the moment, but they come and go. Not coming while I'm here. It's around here? - Yes! But before ... - My contacts told me ... that most of its guests are in transit, are fleeing the country. - Most, yes. - Well, it's not my case. I am a teacher and soloist of Congregation Beth Kodesh. I will not be taken by those German and his thousand-year Reich. Who is this man? As a patriarch Isaac or Jacob, father of nations. Papa, we have a new guest. This is my father, Mr. Ten Boom. Pope, this is Mr. .. Wijnstok, Meyer Wijnstok. Nice to meet you, Mr. Ten Boom. God willing and the accommodations are good, I'll be with you to end this madness. - You're welcome. - Thanks. Mlle. Ten Boom, my room, please. Aunt Betsie! My friend needs a place Jan to stay for a while. He fled the train. At noon tomorrow will new identity papers. But ... where they got the uniforms? Not all Germans Nazis are, Aunt Betsie. His name is Jan? Corrie! Mr. Wijnstock refused helping in the kitchen again. He has to study. If you want to eat, he has to do their part in the work. - Where is he now? - In the living room. Could I ... Oh, sorry! Sorry. Corrie, he was upset today. He discovered that the call of "Eusie" in the back. He was considered an honor. I should be flattered to be compared to a scholar! But a scholar Gentile. He said ... we should compare the Io Josephus. Rules are rules! Mr. Wijnstok, my sister said you refused ... Mlle. Ten Boom, I'm praying. Already refused to work on Saturday because of the Sabbath. After he refused to work Sunday, that was our day of rest. I was just trying to respect the customs of this house. But today is Tuesday. Tell me, Miss. Ten Boom, because they found it necessary give me a nickname? We call Eusie because ... Eusie is the kind of name we would give to a cat. As a guest in your home should not be more respected? We're totally changing the subject. However, as this seems to give satisfaction, please have the courage to use the name in my presence. If you want Eusie, so be it. Ladies! - Good morning! - Good morning! - Good morning! - Good morning! It's past seven! Feel the smell of coffee? Betsie! Betsie ... Good morning! - What? - Today is day 18! - Birthday Dad and Mom! - Oh, no! 54 coupons for sweets. Tell Mr. Klassen what's for Dad. Corrie ... Corrie ... that blouse and skirt ... You should not use. Not today. But ... You'd look like a flag Stretched on a mast. But you always like this blouse. The blouse is beautiful and you're beautiful But the combination of you, the blouse and skirt ... is impossible. Santa Fluc Santa Fluc Pope Ten Boom, you is an extraordinary man. To a great man ... there must have been a great woman. Well, this is not just a song ... is a more ... blessing. It means "May the Lord bless you, and keep you, and to illuminate His face upon you. " You want the whole Haarlem you listen to? I did not ask to be born Jewish. I'm tired of having to ... carry the burden of suffering worldwide. Just because the name my mother was ... Stein. Then you will be another Esau selling his birthright for a mess of pottage! Do not want your great Jewish heritage! I want nothing to do with his Lord God Jehovah. It is not easy be in the palm of the hand of God. Betsie, answer the door. - Betsie, go! - Yes, yes I will. Yes, one moment! Is Mrs. Beukers. Betsie, are you insane?

The way we were passing messages in church. - Kik! - Tia Corrie. All these numbers ... what they mean? Different things, general instructions. Instructions for what? Well, there may be a pilot lying around. The numbers may be coordinates to the rescue ... or perhaps to explode a Nazi supply train! Stuff like that. Sabotage? This means blood on our hands.

Ten Boom? Yes! I appreciate your promptness. Heard a lot about you. About their work. - Actually it is the work of my father. - I'm not talking about watches. His other work. You mean to children? We had to cancel classes. Mlle. Ten Boom, many of us who can not express our feelings, greatly appreciate the work they are doing. People call his house "Hiding from God." Is this some kind of trap? Use the name of the Lord is not correct. If it was a trap, would be another room, talking to the Gestapo. This will not leave. So why did you call me here? I want you ... pass the name of this man to your friends. Who is he? An entrepreneur. He denounces people to the Gestapo. He receives 75 florins per head. Just pass the name ... and they will take care of him. If I did what you asked ... would be to kill him with my own hands. I can only put Io Lord's hands, and ask Him that reach your heart. Do it, Miss. Ten Boom. The demons are on the loose today. He thought he could sleep with any noise. Want some tea? Thanks. You know, Miss. Ten Boom ... we are very similar. Stubborn ... firm ... determined. Still not doing their share of housework. We are equal, yes. But I'm more ... then ... I won! Did you know ... I have a wife and young son? That's right.

I had a boyfriend, but I was not thin enough for his family. I had no style. Still, I was the first woman to obtain license to watch the Netherlands. And you have your father, and his religion. Is that enough? More than enough. God has been good to me. Yes, I ... I think so. And I think ... that already go to my bed. I will pray for your family.

I'll call. - And use the steam kettle! - Yes, yes. I feel that today the Lord wants we read Romans chapter 8. Who shall separate us the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution or famine or nakedness, or peril, or sword? This means that God abandoned us? No! In all these things, however, are more than conquerors through Christ who loved us. Because I am convinced that neither death nor life ... nor angels, nor principalities ... can separate us from the love of God. Nor things present ... nor things to come, nor powers ... nor any other creature can separate us ... Side door. Come on. All upstairs! Corrie! Yes, I am sorry, but we closed until 2 am. Mlle. Ten Boom ... marked time with his sister. Mr. Vogel? I need the money now! - Yes, of course, I'll pick him up. - Please! Mlle. Ten Boom! - On your marks, everyone! - Come, quick! - Please, Miss.

I do not know what you mean. - Where are the Jews? - What Jews? O Lord Jesus, help me! Where are the Jews? Where is the secret room? Corrie! Stop it! We did nothing wrong in this house. So why are all these ration coupons? To feed an army? What does your book about obeying authority? There is a moment ... where we choose between God and man. Keep walking. - Name? - Cornelia. Ten Boom, Elizabeth. - Name? - Ten Boom, Casper. Papa! Only six? Seven. God is with us. Ten Boom ... Give me your word that will behave, and may die in peace in his bed at his home.

And I live for revenge Pigs who betrayed me. You owe me 75 guilders! Are you cold? For me it is very pleasant. Sorry. Here for violation the rules of rationing. Care to say where he got these extra coupons? Sometimes they just appeared. Like so ... appeared? Were tucked under the door. Other times I have been market data. By whom? - A Mr. Smit. - Mr. Jan Smit? Can you tell me about their activities? My sister and I we took classes on the Bible until these classes were banned. And we worked with exceptional children. - How? - Like what? As they worked with? We taught them about God. What a waste! If you want to convert, certainly worth a normal person delayed more than all the world. In the eyes of God, a child may be worth more than ... The daughter of a watchmaker. Maybe ... but I know that He is always watching over me. You really believe that? I believe that He is looking for you too, Lieutenant. Tell me, Miss. Ten Boom, how can one believe in God leaving an elderly man die in prison? And your body be buried in a common grave? My father? It seems that he was taken ill after 10 days. He was taken to a hospital in The Hague, but unfortunately ... there were no beds. He apparently died in the hallway. One type of administrative malfunction. In these circumstances, nobody complains when the body ... is difficult to know where you are. I know where my father is, Lieutenant. That's all, Mlle. Ten Boom. Do you have news from home.
