L- I just, I never met anyone like you before. What do you want? Tell me what you want. If you don't tell me, I'll be forced to improvise and who knows what will happen then. So... what is it? What do you want? Could I maybe get a glass of water? No. Yeah. - Come here. - Hold on. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What kind of game is this? - A really, really fun game. - Yeah? - Come here. - Hold on. Hold on. Whoa, whoa. What are you doing? No, no, come on. - Do you know what this is? - What are you doing? No, no, no. Don't play with that. - These are really fun. - Whoa, whoa, hey. - Come on, come on. - No, you come on. God. It's gonna be fun, I promise. Whoa. Where you going? Come back. Come here. What are you doing? Hey, where'd you go? Come back. Come back. Where'd you go? Here, why don't you take off the cuffs? Whoa, whoa. What was that? What was what? "Aida" walks a fine line between post-feminist critique and blatant objectification. Images of schoolgirls commonly associated with innocence, perfection, and conformity in Japanese pop culture are twisted and inverted. Severed limbs and shackles play in stark contrast to crisp school uniforms and a pervading sense of serene and subservient calm. Women are depicted as playthings, or even as pets. Now, in his series, "Edible Artificial Girls," he shows teenage girls as a pure commodity. A snack food for men. But are these images a rejection of misogyny or a celebration of perversions that are found in male-dominated art throughout the world? Hey. Did you get my text? What? Wow. Okay. Hey, you're still coming to The Cave tonight, right? Shit. - I totally forgot. - What do you mean? I'm sorry. I made plans. - But you promised me. - I know. And my friend Tyler is playing and I told him you were coming. Why? You know I have a boyfriend. Terry's not a boyfriend. He's like, 45 years old and he's married, Shae. He's 35 and they're separated. You need to be careful. The guy's, like, having a midlife crisis. No, he's not. All right, I'll stop pushing. But I still want you to come to the party. - I told you, we have plans. - What are you guys doing? We're gonna go see the Martin McDonagh play and then we're going to the Hamptons for the weekend. All right, fuck the party. Can I come with you? No? No. Have fun this weekend and I'll see you on Monday. All right. - Bye, girl. - Bye. - Have fun in the Hamptons. - I'll try. Come here, Calvin. Come here. Over here, silly. There it is. What's the matter? Did something happen? I can't see you anymore. Sarah and I are gonna try and work things out. What do you mean? I'm so sorry, Shae. But I've got to think about what's best for Celice. Celice? My daughter. You have a daughter. She's three. You never told me you had a daughter. Well, it didn't seem to matter at the time. Shae, come on. You're a beautiful and intelligent girl, Shae. What we've had together has been amazing. But we can't sustain it. There's a million guys out there your age who'd kill to be your boyfriend. Hi. Come on, Gus. What are you doing? Let's go. You think it's in my head. You think I'm crazy. - It's not. - She's just jealous. See ya, Jim. That'll be 28. Do you wanna keep it open? What can I get you? Large Mexican Cosmo... and your digits. That'll be $82. So many girls... and so little time. Are you fucking kidding me? $3? Brad... my God! That's so close. I was wondering why everybody was yelling. - What are we doing? - We're related. You okay? Is it a guy? You want me to kill him for you? My name's Lu. Lulu, really, but you can just call me Lu. Shae. I know. I started last weekend, but I... I saw you upstairs on Saturday night. What are you doing now? You wanna get a drink somewhere, maybe? Hey, I get off at 3:00. No takers? I'm not complaining. Hey! My God. - How's it going in there? - Great. What do you wanna do next? Doesn't matter. I'm just happy to be out. I do like, work in sculpture, you know? Yeah. Working with metal a lot. - New friends. - To friends. - Good friends. - Cheers. Make yourselves at home. Beer, water, guys? - Something to drink? - Beer. Beer... please. - Beer. - Beer it is. What are these guys' names again? - I'm Eric. - Eric. And this pretty young man is Simon. Simon. And that guy over there is Duncan playing DJ. Dude, none of that gay '80s shit tonight, man. You guys live here together? Just me and Duncan. You two lovers? No, we have separate bedrooms. Would you like to see them? Maybe after you open this beer. It's almost tomorrow. I should go back in the other room. What are we doing here? Hey, are you okay in there? Yeah, I'll be right out. You've been in there for a while. Are you sure you're okay? Hey. What... what you been doing in here? Just sitting. You want me to get you a glass of water? I think I need to go home. Okay. I'll walk you. It's okay. No, it's no problem. I was gonna leave anyway. Taxi! Beats walking. Ready? It was nice meeting you. Thanks so much for getting me home. Can I come up? I'm really tired. I just want to sleep. We can sleep. Seriously, nothing else. I promise. I actually have a boyfriend. Sorry. Bye. Hey, can I get your number at least so I can call you sometime? I already told you, I have a boyfriend. I just want your number. How about you give me your card and I'll call you? Yeah, bet you say that to all the guys. - Hey, how about a kiss? - Whoa. Can I just... can I at least get a kiss good night? One kiss and I'll let you go. No, you... you really need to go. You think you're fucking better than me? You're hurting my wrist. Stop hurting my wrist. Who do you think you are, you fucking slut? No, no! Where the fuck do you think you're going? Get your fucking hands down. You like playing games? - Fuck! - Help! Come on. Come on...! Let go. Hold still. Lie still. Avery, Armstrong & Kaczynski. How may I direct your call? Diane Marshall. Diane Marshall's office. Hi, it's Shae. Ls my mom available? She's not available right now, Shae. Can she call you back? No, I really need to talk to her. She's in a meeting right now, but I can have her call you when she's out. Or you can leave a message on her voice-mail if you want. Do you want to leave a message? You've reached Diane Marshall. Please leave a message and I'll call you back. If you need to reach me immediately, please call my assistant, Jessica... You've reached Karen. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Daddy did it. Daddy did that. My goodness. What a beautiful braid. What the fuck are you doing here, Shae? Please, I just need to talk to you. Who is it, baby? You can't just... Come on. What the fuck are you doing? You can't just show up like this. Okay, what? What's going on? What'd you wanna talk about? - Never mind. - I can't do this anymore, Shae. I've told you already. I have a family back there. It's not fair on them. It's not fair on you. You okay? Come on, I'll take you home. No, Terry. Stop. Hey, come on. This is what you wanted, no? You wanna fight me? You wanna fight? Come on. Go, please. Stop. Stop it! Stop! Get the fuck off me! I don't know what you want from me, Shae. I really don't. I'm sorry about the table. I'm... I'm sorry. Hi. I've always been interested... I need to speak to someone to report a crime. Well, you've come to the right place, sweetheart. What sort of crime would you like to report? I was assaulted this morning by a man. Did you call 9-1-1? - No. - Why not? I don't know. Well, you look fine to me. You need to fill out some paperwork if you want to file a report. It's down the hall. Processing. Room 112. Can I help you with something else? He told me to fill out this paperwork. Excuse me? Come with me. Marshall, number 73. Ahem. Hi. Can I help you? I was gonna ask you the same thing. Sorry? Don't be sorry. Sorry's a sign of weakness. You should project strength. Do you wanna fuck me? What? You heard me. I asked if you wanna fuck me. You're married, right? So what were you looking at? - I'm sorry, okay? I was just... - I asked you a question. What if I said I want you to take me someplace and fuck me? Someplace with a little bit of privacy. I just wanna fuck. So this Simon fella... you met him at the bar and you took him back to your house with you. Did this guy have a last name? Come here. Come here. Come here. Come. Yeah? Where you going? Come back. Where'd you go? Come back. What are you doing? Hey, come back. Hey, why don't you take off the cuffs? Whoa, whoa. What was that? - What was what? - What are you doing? What are you doing? Um... Whoa, whoa, whoa. No. Don't fuck around. - Come on. - You come on. I'm serious. This is not a game. I'm serious. What... what do you want? What do you want? What do you want? I'll do... fuck... I'll do anything you want. No, I'll do anything you want. Fuck. Please, please. Please, please, please, please, please don't hurt me. Please, please, please. Aw, fuck. God, no. No! God, no. God. Please. Please, please, please don't do this. Please, please. I'm begging you, please don't hurt me. Please. I have a little girl. I have a little girl. We'll need to deal with it ourselves. - "Deal with it"? - Get our own justice. - What do you mean? - Close. For starters... we go back to those guys' house and find out where he lives. Men are easy to manipulate. It won't be hard. Besides, if they don't cooperate, I have a gun. You have a gun? I thought it might be useful to have one. Where'd you get a gun? From a guy I met who was a cop. You met a cop and he gave you a gun? I can be very persuasive. So, we go visit Eric and the Duncan guy and find out where he lives. Then we just go to his house. Piece of cake. Hi. I have to go to the bathroom. Ls your friend Simon here? We're looking for him. No, he went back to Brooklyn. Ls that where he lives? Red Hook. Do you have an address? - An address? - Yeah. I'd like to talk to him. Talk to him? What are you, a fucking parrot? So you gonna tell me his address or what? I don't know his address. Eric might, but he's not here right now. Should be back in a bit. So... Why do you want to talk to Simon so bad? We don't want to talk. You think that's funny? Simon said you two got freaky last night. Maybe you're looking for... a little more action? What? He's dead. Are you okay? Shae? I'm fine. You sure you're all right? What do we do next? Wait for Eric, I guess. You sure you're all right? Riboflavin. Thiamine? B-12. Vitamin A? Folic acid? Hundred percent. No shit? From now on, I'm only eating Cap'n Crunch. Four bowls a day and you got a well-balanced diet. Crunchinate me, Cap'n. You might need a steak every once in a while for protein, but for vitamins and minerals, the captain's got you covered. Guess how much vitamin C is in a bowl of Cap'n Crunch as a percentage of the daily recommended allowance? Wrong. Hundred percent. They must add that. Are you kidding? They add all that shit. Unless it's in the Crunch Berries. Do you have an address for where your friend Simon lives? He lives in Brooklyn, in Red Hook. Yeah, we got that much already. We're looking for an address. Your boyfriend thought you'd know it. He's not my boyfriend. Well, it's none of my business, really, is it? Fag. What the fuck is wrong with you? Just fuckin' with you, Ric. So, do you have an address for Simon or not? Ricky. Focus. Over here. I asked you a question. You're totally weird. He lives in a warehouse in Red Hook down by the water at 609 Halleck Street. - I don't know the zip code. - That's okay. Ls... is that a gun? I mean, is it... is it real? Jesus fucking Christ! No, please, wait... - What the fuck are you doing? - We're gonna cut you up. Okay, okay. Stop fucking around and untie me. See, the problem is bleeding. Once we hit a major artery, the party's over. Are you fucking crazy? Untie me. We need, like, a tourniquet, right? Like, if we tie it tight right up here, we cut it anywhere down below. Okay, stop fucking around and untie me. Okay, all right. You've made your point. All right? Look, why don't you just untie me now? You can just walk away. Okay? Just untie me now and we'll call it even. All right, you are fucking crazy. I don't know what you're thinking. Look, just let me go now and I won't press charges. I won't... we won't... I'll just let it go. Just untie me and we can talk about this like rational fucking people. You're not gonna fucking get away with this shit, okay? So just untie me now and you can leave. I swear to fucking God, if you don't fucking untie me... you fucking untie me right now. You fucking untie me right now! Fuck. Let me go! No! No! Let go of me! Let's get this show on the road. What the fuck? God, no! No, no, no! Don't fucking do it. No, no, no, no. Don't fucking do it. No, no, no. No, don't fucking do it! No, no! That's it for the feet. You wanna do the arms? What's the matter? What? - Please. - Please? - Please. - Please what? - Please don't. - Don't what? Please let me go. You got someplace you have to go? By all means go. - Come on, Shae. - Wha... what? - Thank God. - Simon has someplace he needs to go. Go on, now. Run along. Aw, you look beautiful. What do you need those feet for, anyways? I could use a chicken parm hero right about now. How about you? Fucking bitch. Ls that him? Hey there. Seriously? Shae, come on. What are you doing? Fuck! No, no, no, no. Not here. Let's take him somewhere outside the city. - Shae! - Shut up! What are you doing, Shae? What's all this about? Shae, what are you doing? Please. You've every right to be angry with me. But I thought you understood me. I thought we had an understanding. What the fuck are you doing? This isn't you, Shae. This isn't you. I know you. Look at me. Shae, look at me! Please. Please, I beg you. I'm a decent guy. I beg you not to do this. Please. I'm so... Shae. I'm a... I'm a decent guy, please. Please, I beg you. I beg you. We can't let him go. I can't do this. - Shae. - He didn't do anything. Everybody did something. Get in the car. There. Right there. It doesn't make me feel any better. What? What we did to those guys. Those pigs? Are you kidding? They deserved it. Maybe, but... it doesn't make me feel any better. It kinda seems like you enjoyed it. Men are all the same. The only thing that stops them from acting like pigs is the fact that they're cowards and they're afraid of getting caught. Did something happen to you? Like, when you were a kid or something? You mean, was I molested by my stepfather? I don't know. I don't have a stepfather. Right. Just asking. When I was about five years old, my dad started letting his friends have sex with me for money. They'd get me drunk and tell me it was what my father wanted and if I loved him, I would do it. And I loved my father, so I did it. But he never paid any attention to me. He barely even spoke to me. Jesus. When I was seven, I got chlamydia. That's when my mom realized what was happening. I think she knew all along, but... it was easier for her to pretend that she didn't. What... My childhood was fine. It was great, actually. Lighten up. Why do you hate people so much? Why do you want to hurt people? 'Cause I can. Come on, Shae. It's what people do. They hurt each other to make themselves feel better, stronger, more powerful. Whatever. That's the way the world works. Besides, it gives me a rush. Tell me you didn't feel it. You're so stupid. No, she's okay. Stop. So what happened to you this weekend? I called you like, five times. Ls everything okay? Shae? What's going on with you? Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. How was your weekend? Early feminist works criticize the western intellectual tradition for its objectionable depiction of women, its misogynist theoretical underpinnings, and its generally inadequate representation of female voices. In the late 1970s, however, a hermeneutics of suspicion arose from feminists who began to feel that gender bias could be revealed by one's perspective on the nature of reality, in one's style of thinking, in one's approach to problems, quite apart from any explicit gender content or attitudes towards the sexes. Do you think it's an accident that the word "hysteria," from the Greek "hysterikos," meaning uterus, was originally conceived as a purely female complaint? Hey. Hi. What you doing? Nothing. L... I was... I was... I was just going home, I guess. What are you doing? I don't know. Kicking your tire. - Sorry. - No. Please, kick it. Kick it all you want. So... Do you want to... Do you wanna do something? Sure. Do you want to go for a ride or something? Don't I need a helmet? I've got a spare. So where are we going? - What's that? - It's some clam. Enjoy. Can we play? Hi, guys. Get some balls. You guys got your balls? And 10 and 13 and number 15. - We got us a winner. - That's me. 15 is the winner. - I'm so excited! - 15. Yes, I was. - Well... - Well... - I had fun today. - Yeah, me, too. Thanks so much for coming with me. Yeah. So... I'll see you at school, I guess? Maybe you wanna come to this thing we're having for Halloween on Thursday down at The Cave? My friend Aaron's band's gonna be playing and I'm gonna DJ. Yeah, maybe. Sure. Well, cool. I mean, only if you want to. No, I definitely... I definitely want to. I'm sorry. When is it again? It's... it's Halloween, which is Thursday. Right. You said that. Well... Good night. Where were you? Jesus Christ, you scared me. What are you doing in the dark? - So where were you? - I went out with some friends. - What friends? - Just some people. Girl people or boy people? School people. What are the names of these people? Are you kidding? I'm just wondering since I made dinner and I've been sitting here waiting for four and a half hours. I was just wondering where you were. Did I know you were making dinner? Did we have a plan? I wanted it to be a surprise. So how was I supposed to know? If you knew, it wouldn't be a surprise. Well... I just thought you'd come home and it would be a surprise. So you've just been sitting in the dark? Yeah. For hours. You're crazy. So who were you with, then? I'm just curious. Can't I be curious? Are you hungry? Do you want me to heat you up something to eat? No, I'm good. It'll only take a minute. I'm not hungry. What are you doing for Halloween? I've got some school stuff, but maybe we can hang out this weekend. Sorry. I'm trying to work here. Excuse me. All right, I'm sorry. I'll be very well-behaved. Dudes, fireworks on the roof! Come on, fireworks on the roof! That was Lycaon Pictus, you'll be interested to know... play a track from their new upcoming album. The track is called "Yes, I am. " Fireworks. On the roof. Hey. Fireworks? - Not so much. - No? - Bathroom? - It's just down the hall. Okay. Be right back. All right. Hey, Shae? I'm really happy you're here. I mean, I'm just... I'm really glad you came, you know. Me, too. Psst. I'm sorry, baby. You understand, don't you? You're not mad at me, are you? I did it for us. Come on, baby. Don't be mad. I did it to protect you. You believe me, right? How about I make us something to eat? Everything will be okay. You'll see. Wow. You cut me really good. Sorry. L- I didn't mean to... You okay? Yeah. It's stupid. Do you have a cigarette? Is it a guy? Yeah.
