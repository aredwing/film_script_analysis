And for them I murdered and I tortured and I destroyed lives. And I helped them. I helped them create this new world where everything has changed. Everything has changed. Ladies and gentlemen, we live in a society that becomes more demanding, fast-paced and hectic by the day. To cope with this, we all need a little help, and as managing director of N-gen Industries, I'm proud to announce the arrival of RAK 295, the next generation of performance-boosting supplement. Mr White, if RAK 295 has an effect on mental and physical abilities, how can you be sure it'll be safe? We pride ourselves on our thorough procedures at N-gen. A full RAK-295 testing programme is underway with 30,000 volunteers participating. Following two months of assessment, they will be recalled, fully tested, and the product will then be available to all. Are you sure two months is enough time? The work of lead scientist, Michael Brooke, and my team prior to the testing phase will be there for all to see, but I can assure you, I have no concerns whatsoever regarding any harmful side effects. - Mr White, I have another question. - No more questions. 'The British pharmaceutical giant, N-gen Industries, 'is facing an unprecedented number of lawsuits. 'Many of the volunteers who took part in the drugs trial two months ago 'have experienced extreme side effects, with some becoming seriously ill. 'RAK 295 was intended as a strength and stamina supplement 'to cope with the strains of modern-day life. 'Test patients have allegedly suffered high fevers, 'vomiting, internal bleeding, 'and in some cases, multiple organ failure. 'Subjects feeling any side effects whatsoever 'are urged to report immediately 'to either N-gen laboratories or to their nearest hospital.' Another 12 people were admitted to St Mary's in Birmingham. And a further 37 to the two hospitals in Manchester. Two more upstairs. So that's all of them, all with failing organs and vascular collapse. And her, Angela Mills. Nothing yet? No sign of her? She's not in any hospital in the country. I want to look at her flat now with Billing. She has a stepbrother in the river service. Cooper's looking into that. - But what about her parents? - Died three years ago. White thinks she might be dead. What if she's alive and unaffected? Either way we need to find her. Our glorious CEO will be paying us a visit later. N- gen, it's finished. Even White's pockets can't handle 30,000 lawsuits. We owe it to these people to fix what we've done. We'll never be able to fix what we've done, Michael. It's already too late for that. Listen, look, I'll be back before White arrives. Just hold it together, yeah? - The incident report was inconclusive. - It's meant to be proof. Your shoulder injury from the struggle is still our best hope. - So what now? - We have a much harder battle ahead. The press are... See for yourself. They've picked a side. I didn't do anything wrong, Morgan. I didn't. I'll see you in court next Tuesday. All out of limos. Great to see you. I'll give it all back to you, Steve. Every penny. I'm not bothered about that, mate. Let's just get you back on track, eh? Fuck it! Get over there. - Who the hell are you? - Never mind me. Who the fuck are you? I'm calling the police. Check that phone. Check his numbers. - No! - Now you listen to me. I'm going to ask you once and once only. Where is Angela Mills? I don't know. I don't know. She... She left two months ago. There's nothing, no number. Where is she? We know she lived here, so where did she go? Aargh! Where's Angela Mills? Where did she go? Billing, leave him. He knows nothing. We're going to be late. Go and get the car. We know where you live, where your daughter goes to school. Prick! 'Another situation needs resolving. 'Do what you do best. 'Leave no trace.' Has anyone died yet, Mr White? How do you plan to defend yourself? 'RAK 295, as has been widely reported, 'was to be a revolutionary over-the-counter performance enhancer. 'As the final testing stages were completed, 'it slowly emerged that serious side effects...' Turn that bollocks off now. - Well, what about the landlord? - He knew nothing. - Are you sure? - Trust me, we were thorough. Cooper should be at the step-brother's house. - Who the fuck are you? - Andy Billing, my replacement. - Good to meet you, sir. - Gentlemen. Wait here. Keep the bloody press out. Hold on a minute. I'm done at the end of the month, Peter. Do you understand me? I'm done. I'm sick of dealing with all your shit and I don't want it any more. We'll discuss that later. Brooke, we need to have a serious chat. You're not turning your back on me, too? This girl, the one from the first batch of volunteers, if she turns up dead, it's prison. No lawsuit. Prison! She may be abroad. There are many possible scenarios, Peter. We have to think positively. There's always a chance she hasn't reacted with it. She may be immune, may be special. - If that's the case... - Oh, just wake up, Michael! That's as close to a 100% failure rate as you're going to get! There's a message from Cooper, boss. If you've killed her, there's nothing I can do. - Me? I told you what we should do. - Oh, shut up! 'Angela Mills is here at her step-brother's. Can't tell what condition... Hang on. 'What the fuck? Fuck off! Go on, fuck off! 'What do you want me to do? 'Some fucking poof just got shanked. He's bleeding all over my car. 'All right, you little shit!' - She's at her step-brother's flat. - Thank Christ. - Her condition? - It's unknown. He's looking into it. Good. You, new man, go and tell Cooper to keep his eye on her and get her here now. Michael, show me this mutant that's got the press up in arms. Then I can go upstairs and placate those bastards. Call Cooper. - Then find out what's going on. - OK. Matt, I know I said it was over, but I think I have to see Joe. I need to talk to him. You can't be serious. You said you'd moved on from him, Angie. He killed a kid. You were right to leave him. Well, come on. - Say something. She's your friend. - We all know how I feel about Joe. Listen, I like Joe as well. Fine, I did like him. And I know you think it was an accident. And if it was, I'm sure the system will clear that up. I've got to go. My shift started at 12 and I'm already late. Just think about it. OK? Joe will always let you down. Always. - I thought you'd support me. - That's what I'm doing. I'll see you later. - Caffeine will give you arrhythmia. - Fuck off! Seriously. Mess up your heart like that RAK shit that's all over the news. - When's your test? - Next week, Thursday. Where have you been? It's a bloody circus here today. Rob's about to crack one off. Matt. Matt! - Where the fuck have you been? - Told you. Sorry, Sergeant. Personal stuff. - How's your step-sister doing, then? - Well, she's still confused. Yeah, well, Joe's a fucking disgrace, isn't he? He let me down. He let the entire MS U down. Anyway, listen up. It's kicking off all over the gaff. Craig's taking the launch to Battersea Bridge. There's some kind of riot going on. People are diving in the drink. So what we're going to do is steam down there and pick up the jumpers. So dust her down, lock 'n' load. Let's get ready to rock 'n' roll, boys. Rob! - Something's wrong with Sally! - There's always something wrong. No, she said some guy attacked her on the way in today and she just fainted. I think it must be shock. Do I look like a fucking doctor? Oh, Jesus! Get ready! Come on, let's go. Jesus fucking Christ! This is John Healy, our first trialist. A week after receiving his initial dose, he started having an allergic reaction. A bad one. We thought it best to keep him in isolation. His physiology and cellular make-up started changing two days later. The viral suppressants we've been administering seemed to keep it at bay. Although it hasn't completely stopped the abnormal changes. We've taken everybody off it to see what would happen. And? Nothing. He's just been lying there. Billing, that doctor. Talk to me. What's going on? What in God's name are these things on his back? - He's not contagious, is he? - We're not sure. Billing, get back here. We've got a problem. Billing, come in. Get an adrenaline shot. Hurry! Cole? Cole! - Everybody just stay still. - What's that noise? Lockdown. Why are we in lockdown, Cole? Get me the fuck out of here! Get me out of here! Open this door! What the fuck was that? What have you done, Brooke? What the fuck have you done? Brooke? Oi, oi! Stay still. Stay still, will you? Stay still. Come on, hold the crazy bastard. Come on, hold him! Keep fucking still, will you? Aaargh! He fucking bit me! Come on, we should go back inside. It's not safe out here. - Where's all your cars? - I had to get the cash from somewhere. - Fucking hell. Sorry, mate. - Enough of that bollocks, eh? It's not important. It's only a bit of cash. Hey, I don't think she knew you were getting out, you know. I haven't seen her since I went in. No letters, no phone calls, nothing. I know I let her down. I need to see her. - She needs to know I didn't do it. - I wish I could help you, mate. But I haven't seen her since it all happened. Come on, eh? I get 24 more hours in the air, then I take my test. I can't wait to get off this fucking river. It's hardly a river, is it? More like a plague-ridden cesspit of Ebola or something. Ebola, no. Plague, maybe. - Bubonic or pneumonic? - What's the difference? What the fuck was that? - Get the boat ready. - Fucking hell! Sarge, Sarge! Sarge, what are you doing? Sarge! Sarge, what are you doing? Guv! Guv! This is MS U Central. We need help. Someone, come in. Matt, what the fuck is going on? This is seriously fucked up. This is MS U Central, come in. We need help. Somebody, anybody. 'Get out of there! Get anywhere! 'Now!' Jim, what the hell's going on? Cole? Cole? Cole, wake up! Cole! Cole, wake up! For God's sake, wake up! Get up, get up. Over here. Something must have gone wrong with the code. What we saw is impossible. This is just impossible. It got in behind him as he was trying to shut the door. Well, the power's back on, so why hasn't help arrived? I hate to think. Well, now we know it spreads. But how? Blood, maybe. Maybe saliva. I don't know. - I just don't know any more. - So that means they've all got it. All of those upstairs and all of those in the hospitals. They're all going to catch it and then it's going to spread even further. And now I've got it. Is there anything I can take? The stuff you used on the other patients. The viral suppressant. It's in there. The syrettes. There's only three but that should control the infection for up to 18 hours. Well, we've got to figure something out. - Aaargh! - No, no, no! - No, no! - Oh, shit. - I thought he was a... - Please hang on. Cole, I didn't realise. This place is a fucking slaughterhouse. They're all dead, and if they're not dead, they're turning. Angela... Talk to me. Talk to me, Michael. Find Angela Mills. - There's more of them coming. - Shut up! You've been bitten. Don't. 'I'm sick of dealing with all your shit. 'And I don't want it anymore.' 'Find Angela Mills.' Aaargh! 'There's only three but that should control the infection for 18 hours.' Aargh! 'So what measures are being taken, Clare, to combat these... things 'and to calm this situation police heads have labelled "A Devil's Playground"?' 'Well, what can anyone do to calm this situation, Adam? 'Nobody seems to know. 'The authorities are having enormous difficulty tackling these hordes. 'Their agility and strength are frightening, 'truly frightening. 'It seems that they will attack anything and everything 'Jesus. I think we're... 'We're going to have to come back to you, Adam.' 'OK. We're hearing now...' OK, we need to get to the Abraxon construction site in Wapping. It's by the river. Matt and Jim will meet us there. It shouldn't take us too long. About 40 minutes. - 'We are unable to connect your call.' - Dead. Please, babe, let's just get out of here. Come on. What about Joe? Shit! - What about Joe? - He's in prison. In one of the safest places possible. Now come on, get in the car. Please, Angie, please. You're not shitting me about the helicopter, are you? No. My instructor goes on about it being a silly place to have a helipad. We even flew over it the other day. The chopper's there, I swear. Just got to figure out how to get to it. Matt. There's some seriously strange noises coming from the canteen. We need to get out of here fucking fast! Jesus Christ, we're fucked! Yes, I know, son. That's why Mummy took you out there with what's-his-name, isn't it? So you could enjoy Spain, the good weather, the food. Just be a good boy for her, OK? All right. Yes, you'll be with Daddy in about a week, OK? All right. I love you too, son. I miss you loads. Hey, look, put your mum on before... Great. - Did you get a doctor to look at that? - Yeah. It might come in handy with the trial coming up. It's proof. What the f? Someone's just done the reporter. 'Er, once again, breaking news. 'A state of emergency has been declared throughout the UK.' What the fuck's going on, Joe? 'Reports are now coming in that an infectious disease of some sort 'is responsible for the outbreak of random acts of frenzied violence. 'The infected are spreading from city centres. 'If you are attacked, the only way to stop them 'appears to be with a blow of extreme force to the head. 'I repeat, the blow must be to the head. 'We will be halting transmission shortly but information will be broadcast on...' Right, we've got a couple of choices. We can either stay here, make sure everything's secure. Or there's a fishing shed up the road near the lake. It stinks a bit but it's made of stone so it'll be safe. - Are you listening? - I've got to find her. - I can't leave her out there in that mess. - Do not do this to yourself, mate. Look, she's a clever girl. She'll be all right. It's chaos out there. What chance have we got of finding her? She's a smart girl. She's probably in a safer place than we are right now. OK? So are we going to stay here or go up to the fishing shed? Yeah. - Yeah, OK, we'll stay here. - Right, good. You check here. I'll go out the back and make sure everything's safe. - Matt will wait for us, won't he? - Of course he will. He's my brother. I hate to say it, but he has got a point. Joe's not right for you. You did so well rebuilding your life without him. Now all that work... Kate, I've made up my mind. Have you thought what the testing might do? No, it's fine. I'm fine. OK. Sorry. Sorry. - All this is just so fucking weird. - I know. But we are going to be OK. Come on! Why aren't they moving? - A345. - What? No. That's going north. We need to head east. It'll take us out of this bloody traffic. We need to go out to come back in. - How? - Come on! What's going on? We need to get out. Hey, stop that! What are you doing? Everybody stop! Oi! Oh, shit! Shit! 'We urge all listeners in the city to evacuate. I repeat. 'Evacuate the city immediately by any means possible. 'Emergency services have been overrun. 'If any member of your group has been bitten by the infected, 'they will have limited time before the infection 'takes over their brain function. 'Do not allow them to stay with you. 'I repeat, do not allow them to stay with you.' God, we're not going to make it. We're going to have to stop somewhere. Where? Steve's. We need to try and find somewhere with more people. Steve's is just down the road. No, no! Please, not now. Not fucking now! Come on. Come on! That's Steve's van. - Why is it so empty? - Something's not right. Looks like two or three people. There's too many fucking rabbits out there, mate. Let's get behind the bench. Hello? Oh! Ange! - What are you doing here? - Jesus, Joe! - Why aren't you inside? - Did you break out? What? No. Baby, I made bail. I got out a couple of hours ago. - You're not hurt, are you? - No, I'm fine. Well, come here. You're safe now. You all right, Kate? So what are you doing here? Steve. Listen, the car's completely broken down. We need your help to fix it. The radiator's gone. You won't get far like that. - Can't you lend us something? - I haven't got anything. We had to sell the lot. Needed the cash. You two should stay here. We'll be all right. No, Joe, we need to get to the Abraxon site across from MS U. Matt's meeting us there with Jim. Jim's learning to be a pilot. He says they've got a helicopter. So what are you doing here? Wapping's the other way. - We figured we'd go round the traffic. - Who's Jim? - Jim's got your old job. - Kate! Fuck 'em. As far as they're concerned, I'm fucking guilty. Did you think they were going to give you your job back? No, we're safe here. - Joe... - The news says to stay indoors. In all fairness, it did say that. You'd be stupid to go into town. It's carnage out there. The news said it was pretty fucking bad. Well, this is hardly Fort Knox! How do we know Matt and Jim will even be there? Unlike you, Joe, we can trust them. - What? - You know what. Just hang on for a minute. - Ange! - Get the gun! What the fuck is it? No, no, no! Don't shoot! Get away from the door! - Easy, easy! - Now just calm down, all right? Just calm down. What the fuck is that? There you go, mate. Do you want one, love? - No, thanks. - Fair enough. So glad just to see some normal faces, you know. What's going on? What happened? Er, well, we were on our way to work Near Bank. My colleague, Alex Johnson, that's the guy who tried to... That was him. He was travelling with us when the subway stopped and all the lights went out. The emergency lights came on. The screaming had started. They came through the carriages, clambering over each other like insects. They bite you. It's like, they bite you and then you become one of them. So we ran through the tunnels till we got back to the station. - The police couldn't do much. - No, they did nothing. One cop, I mean, he had a shotgun. He'd been bitten three or four times. So he turned... He turned the gun around. - His head split open like a log. - Fucking Jesus! Well, that settles it. We barricade these fucking doors and we stay here. No, wait a second. You haven't understood. These things chase people. That's all they care about. Everybody's running away from the city. Running this way. Do you hear that? There can't be any questions now. We go to the Abraxon site, yeah? - What's there? - There's a helicopter. - Sounds like a plan. - Why don't we head for the coast? There's too many of us. There's not enough room. Matt said it was a four-seater helicopter. Four people. It's a fucking joke! No, we'll make it work. We'll make it work somehow. Oh, my God. There's someone outside. Joe! Aaaargh! Is he one of them? You all right, mate? Shit, they're coming through the office window! Fuck it! Get over there! Take this. On three, you go over the top and you go behind me, OK? One... two... three! Matt, wait. Sandra, what? Sandra? Oh, Jesus! Sandra? Run! No, Andy! Fuck! Fucking hell, run! Run! Run! Jim, look. They're scared of the water. We might make it, Jim. We might just fucking make it. Jesus Christ, are you OK? Keep it raised. - Let's just get out of here. I'll be fine. - Try and stop the blood flow. Ow! That's all we can do. We were quick. You might be lucky. - What about me? - What about you? I'm still here, ain't I? All right, listen, everyone. You've seen what two of them can do. They move fast and they spread fast. We need to do exactly the same thing. Now, as this is a garage, I'm hoping there's a car we can use. Who are you? She asked you a question. - I'm Cole. - What are you doing? I'm running, just like everyone else. We're all in the same boat so we need to help each other. What happened back there? Looked like a heart attack. What are you, a fucking doctor? I'm a diabetic. There's a van outside. I need to change the fuel pump. I think I can use the one from Angie's car. I'll try and make a start on it, all right? There's a helicopter at a site in Wapping. Yeah, but that's that way, isn't it? Back in the shit. Don't see your helicopter outside. - OK, so what type is it? - I don't know. It's a four-seater. Well, the only way round that is to do multiple trips. I'm good with cars but not with helicopters. We have a pilot. And who would that be? He's a friend of ours. He's meeting us there. I need a map. Show me. And now there's even more of us. Steve, you've got to be quick. There's not a lot of time. Have you got any soya milk? Yeah, it'll be in the fridge next to the caviar. The man in the suit, is that the policeman that? - Yeah, that's the same prick. - Hey, Katie, watch your mouth, eh? - He's still a good mate of mine. - I'm sorry, I'm just... I'm not coping well with this, you know? Yeah, well, the way I see it, everybody deserves a second chance. It is him. Yeah, I thought so. He was meant to go on trial sometime soon. Shot a kid who stole a boat. Back home a cock-sucker gets the chair, no questions asked. There's something that's bothering me more than that. - What's that? - Friends and family. Most important thing in the world. And we're neither. We're the outsiders here. OK, the helicopter holds four people. So we do three separate trips as agreed. I'll go last. - You all right, mate? - I didn't agree to it. - It's a fucked-up plan. - Why? What if the pilot don't want to come back or the chopper runs out of juice? What do the second and third parties do? Just wait around and be attacked? Forget the helicopter. We drive. We go to Dover, Folkestone, wherever. We grab a boat. Are you mad? You'd last ten minutes at the most. I've just spent two months in prison. I think I can handle a road. Yeah, well, once we get the helicopter, you're more than welcome to the van and the road. Me and Angela will drop you at the Abraxon place and then go our... You go on your own. She comes with us. Are you fucking serious? What, you think I'm some sort of? Jesus, enough! She stays with me. Do you understand? How long with that fuel pump? We've got to get that van going. How's your arm, Jim? Is it getting worse? Look, whatever "it" is, Andy's infected me with it. Fucking arsehole! If we don't make it to the helipad, just fucking throw me overboard. I'm not doing that, Jim. You can't let me become one of those things. I can't do that, Jim. OK. Promise me. I promise. Why are you showing me this? - You know why. - I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine. That's why I'm here. Because of the testing. Everyone who took RAK has turned into one of those things. I saw one change right in front of my own eyes. - Are you saying that I'm next? - No, I don't think you will be. and are spreading it. For some reason, you're different from all the other trialists. You're special somehow. We've got to get you out the country and into a lab. And we've got to do some tests. You might be the person to stop all this, but first things first. You listen to me. Just leave me alone, Joe. That shit on TV. It's the reason behind all this. People having heart problems. They're the symptoms, the start of it. I was one of the first trialists. - So are you? - No. I haven't got any symptoms. I'm the only one who hasn't. - Why did you do it? - Why do you think, Joe? I was trying to rebuild my life. I needed the money. Who told you about the drug? Cole? He's lying. Doesn't make sense. - Why is it spreading? - I don't want to talk about it anymore. I don't want to talk about it, Joe. In all the time we were together, I never lied to you once, Ange. I just want you to know that. I'm pregnant, Joe. What? Well, do you want to keep it? Yeah. I think I do. I'll be there for you. You know that, don't you? No matter what. All the more reason to get you out of here in one piece, eh? Steve's nearly done. We need to move. Now. For fuck's sake. - What are you doing? - Sorry. - Just practising. - Practising what? Give me the weapon. - Stand up. - Why? - Stand up! - Hey, come on. Let me tell you something. Right here, right now, you do exactly as I say. And don't fucking question me again. You got that? - Show me your hand. - You be careful! Am I going to be OK? Probably. - What do you mean, "probably"? - You ready? - I'm coming as well. - Whatever. Geoff. He's going to leave us behind. That's exactly what's going to happen. He doesn't like us. If there are too many of us and not enough room on that helicopter, - we're the ones he'll leave. - Yeah, but Lavinia... - Geoffrey. - We won't let that happen. Right? There's something I want you to know. Yeah? She's pregnant and it's mine. So whether she's immune or not, she's coming with me. There's no way I'm letting them become someone's chemistry project. So you'd better stay out of my fucking way. You know, there was a time when right now you'd be screaming and begging for mercy. The RAK testing, Katie. It's responsible for all of this. - You don't know that. - I do know that. Cole told me. He works at N-gen. He saw a guy who took it there turn. What? God, I don't know. I don't know. I'm so scared. Oh, my God. You could turn into one of those things. What? No, I won't. I'm fine. I'm fine right now. Yeah, sorry. I'm shocked, that's all. You've said all along you feel fine, right? Right? Fuck! Hey. You know, in the States RAK 295 was apparently going to be marketed as Quentinium. So? Lucky nobody in here takes it, that's all. Imagine if they did. My God! She's fine. You're the one with the bitten finger, remember? Come on, Kate. Do I look dangerous to you? If that crap had got into my bloodstream, do you think I'd be sitting here? Yeah, well, Ange is not exactly biting people, is she? Yeah, but I'm not the one who's been injected with RAK. - She could be immune. - Well, are you willing to take that risk? I can't help but wonder what would happen if we're halfway across the Channel in that chopper with nowhere to go and she turns into one of those things. What then? I know it's not an easy thing to imagine, Kate, your friend becoming like one of those things. But the same thing happened to my colleague and it's no longer them. They're as good as dead. Actually, they're worse. What? Tell me. What? You know what? I want you to get out of the car. - Get out of the car! - Hey, it's just an opinion, all right? Lavie, the blonde, she's infected with the same shit that turns you into one of those things. That's all we need. Sorted. What is it? We have to move, now. Everybody get moving! - Joe? - Get the flashlights from the office. OK, now's our chance. Lock her in! - Lavie! - Close the fucking door! Katie? Katie! All right, let's go. Let's move! Get out of here! - The van won't start, mate. - Angela? Wait, I can't get the van started. Into the woods, move! Move! Move it! - What happened? - I don't know. A shelf fell across the door. I was trapped. We have to find them. - Baby, they could be anywhere. - What? No... We need to think about other things. Let's get to the coast. No, please, we have to. I think there's one place we can try. Abraxon, Jim. We made it. We're here. Grab it, grab it! Jim. Jim, OK. I'm going to go and have a look and then I'll come back for you. - OK? - Yes. Just hurry up, will you? Or I won't be able to fly anything. And Matt... Remember what I said, yeah? Before. Angie? Aaaargh! Are you kidding? A fishing hut! You got any better ideas? No, I didn't think so. Joe knows where this place is. So this is where he'll come, all right? - Are you sure he'll come? - Joe's a mate. We still don't know where Ange is. Let's get inside here and wait for Joe. He knows where we are. Aaargh! Katie! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Steve, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry! Let us in, you fucking bastards! Let us in! Ange. You can't do what Cole says. He'll take you to some fucked-up lab. They'll do all sorts of experiments on you. They may even force you to lose the baby. Joe, what really happened on the boat with that kid? I replay that moment in my mind every single day. Sometimes... I manage to talk sense into him, you know? I manage to get the gun off him, and then I'm the hero. The hero who saved a young man high on crack from shooting someone. And not the cop who killed a 14-year-old kid. It doesn't matter now. He's dead. And whether he deserved it or not, I helped him on his way. That's something I'll have to live with for the rest of my life. I'm not going to let you down again. Open the fucking door! Fuck. Fuck! We're nearly there. Once she's gone, there's only four of us. I can't do this. What are you doing? Hey, you listen to me! We have to open the door. She will attract more of those things. Is that what you want? Huh? - Kate, I'm sorry... - How could you? - What was I meant to do? - What is the matter with you? Leave him alone! You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch! Angie! Those fuckers locked us out. Hey, we were attacked. You know what'll happen to him. Fuck off! She's staying with me. She don't want to go with you. I'm not going to tell you again. You really think it's that easy? Don't fucking tell me... - I can if I have to. - No, you can't. Because I can tell you ain't got it in you, Joe. I can see it in your eyes. Because I've killed more people than I care to remember and I do not want to see you ever, ever end up like me. Listen to me. Take that to him. Do it. Oh, fuck! Joe. I don't want my little boy to know I knew you'd come back, mate. You. What did I say to you? What did I say to you? - He hasn't done anything. - Shut your fucking mouth! - Stay away. - You two are staying here. How's your back, Angela? Huh? How's that chest pain? She took RAK. She's going to turn into one of those fucking things. Get on your fucking knees! You left her in there, didn't you? - You left her in there. Answer me. - He didn't do anything! - She did! - What? That's not true. That's a lie. I didn't do anything. That's a fucking lie! Don't, Cole. It isn't right. She knows you're going to turn into one of them. She doesn't trust you. None of us do. Please, I didn't do anything. I promise you, I didn't do anything! Please believe me. That's just it, though, isn't it? You just left me there. You didn't try to help me. You did nothing. Everyone in the van. - Hold on. - I don't care what you think! I'm not lowering myself to their level. Matthew Mills of the Marine Support Unit. Come in, HMS Valiant. 'This is HMS Valiant. Five miles east from city limits along the River Thames. 'Any surviving citizens are to proceed water-bound eastward along the Thames 'and await rescue. Over.' Proceed eastbound along the Thames on the water. Copy. Copy that. We'll be there. Wait for us! 'Proceed water-bound eastward, Mills. 'We will remain in situ for 12 hours. Over.' Copy that. We'll be there, we'll be there. Angie! Jim? It's me, Matt. Come on, it's Matt. What is it, mate? What? Stop. Jim. Jim. Jim! Jim, listen to me. Listen to me. What if it happens when we're in the air? - What then? - Why don't you shut up? - Am I the only one concerned? - How's your hand? It's stopped hurting. - Has it? - Yes. - It has. - Good. Stop the van. - What? - Stop the van, Cole! I'm not going. - You're forgetting something. - The real monsters are in this van. - I know that. - They can have their helicopter. I'll take my chances on the road with Joe. I can't stop those things getting to us. But I can stop this lot. - They would rather see me dead. - Now you listen to me. I've got you this far, haven't I? And I'll get you to the finish line, because I know I can. But you have to let me finish what I've started. You have to. You're the only hope for a cure. - OK. - Ange, you cannot let them turn you into a lab rat. Oh, shit! Go! Move! Abraxon, through the gates. Hold on! Ange? It's all right. - Katie! - No, no, no, no! I'm sorry. Stay quiet. Stay quiet. Let's go. No. Let us go, Cole. Let us go. You know what they're going to do to her, I can't let that happen. You four, you take the helicopter. We'll take that truck there. It's like a tank. Everybody wins. - No, you won't stand a chance, Joe. - Well, we can try. I have to do this. For everyone's sake. - Come on. - Angie! I can't let you do this! Matt? We're not going anywhere! Fuck! Now what do we do? - Angie. - Matt, oh. Are you OK? Listen, I've got a Zodiac on the river. The HMS Valiant is ten miles downstream to the east. Whatever these things are, they fucking hate water. So I think we can make it, OK? - I don't even know you. - Trust him. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Just trust him. He's my brother. - Come on, Joe. - OK, let's go. Come on! Let's go! Oh, Geoffrey! Geoffrey! Help him! Geoffrey! - Go and get the boat ready now. - What's happening? Leave him. He's got it. Nothing you can do. Go. - Come on. - You fucking help him! Or I'll kill her. - No. - I'll scream. - I'll scream so loud they'll all come. - No, you won't. Help him. Help him! You let her go now. Get to the boat. Go. Give me the gun. Lavie, don't leave me. - I'm coming with you. - No, you're not. You should never have threatened her, ever. I just wanted to save you. They're coming, they're coming! What the hell's he doing here? Angie, watch out! Matt! Matt! Matt! No. No! No, don't! Just get her on the boat! No! No! Just take her and go. Oi, no, Joe, come on. You're coming with us. I can't. Oh, Joe! It's OK. It's all right, it's all right. I can't be without you again. You won't be. Angela! You do the right thing. I love you. Just go. Go. 'I've done so many bad things in my life.' But I'm not asking for forgiveness. 'Because I've had my shot at redemption. 'And every second chance, 'well, it comes with a price.' - You ready? - I'm ready. You've done good, Joe. 'Two of us needed her first. 'And now she can save the rest.' I'm sorry, Ange. I'm so sorry. Come on, let's go. Let's go. What did that guy mean? When he said, "Do the right thing", what did he mean? I need to see some doctors. As soon as I can. 'This is HMS Valiant to Control. 'We are now proceeding en route to safe zone. 'Confirm we have picked up two civilians. 'Request immediate transfer of female adult 'to infection control research unit. 'Over and out.' So, my time has come. Being part of this world I helped create. I'll die with it.
