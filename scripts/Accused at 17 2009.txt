Their parties seem to be the end. As long as I'm back at nine. You do not make it later, huh? - No. We will not stay long. How far away is that party or not? We're almost there. - I told you 'remote'? It is an old house or something that is ideal for. It's over this corner, I believe. - Yes, it is right around the corner. Wait, what is this place?

Look at her eyes, I think they ... She has nothing. She pretends Imagine not you so and come up. - Stop. She stopped breathing. Arise. Dory, get up. Arise. Dory, stand well on ... What are you doing? - I'll call an ambulance. Have you lost your mind? - Somebody help her. We have to help her. - You can not. It is too late. Give me a minute, okay? Let me think. Damn. Want to jail? Is that what you want? Because that is what will happen if you tell anyone, okay? I did nothing. Yes. You have driven us here. You knew the plan. You had also attended. - We wanted to hurt her. So the police will not think about. Then we get both problems ... It'll be fine. Listen ... Nobody knows we're here.

And you slipped on gravel? - Yes. I'm tired and have a headache. I really need to talk to you about last night. I did not mean what I said. I'm sorry if I have hurt. Trevor I'll make my excuses in an email. That's not the point, I want to talk about your father There are things that you will now understand ... Can not this another time? - That you did not understand when you were 12. Let your voicemail but take. - Is it not important. Let your voicemail but take. - I can not, it's important. I do not want to talk to you. - Cver your post, I can explain. You slept? With Dory - I have not done. I was terribly drunk. You were not too drunk to her telling me that I was still a virgin. I do not know what to say except that I'm sorry. Since it is now too late for something. Hey, I did not hear you come home. Did you have fun with your girlfriends? Yes, it was very nice. Maybe I can even sleep without snoring of your father. Good night, honey. - Okay, Mom. Trusts. What was that? What's so secret? Dory's mother called me this morning. She did not come home last night. Nothing to worry about. Typical for Dory. Did you tell her about ... - The joke? Of course not Why not? - She was wrong nothing when we went. They may be lost. We have to tell someone. We love it for us ... She clings hiding so everyone is worried. She wants us to confess then she can play the victim. Yeah, she's already gone. - Like when that guy's houseboat. Yeah, she's already gone. - Like when that guy's houseboat. She'll be showing up again. Until then, we keep our mouths shut. Let's go. She did not come home last night. I've always been kind to you. - So what? Typical for Dory. - You're such a bitch. She was wrong nothing when we went. - You can leave me hler Nlet. She was wrong nothing when we went. - You can not leave me here. They may be lost. - She'll be showing up again. We should tell someone, Fallyn. She has nothing against you, Trevor. It's not personal. She wants to itself even in an e-mail apologize, she said. She did. It was a very nice mail. I do not know what to do ... with Bianca. Within a year, they are studying, 4000 miles from here. If I can not close that gap now I may never get the chance. I want you in my life. But Bianca comes in first place. I love you, but I need time to solve this. It's all right. I see. You know how much I care to you and Bianca. Take as much time as you need. I will be patient. I listen ... I'm going now, but you can call me. Goodbye, Bianca.. What was that about, did you split up? Surely not because of me? It was my decision. - Oh no? I put this is right. He did not receive my email? - Let him go. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm pretty messed up for you. Is it? - Yes. I just discovered where was that party. It does not matter anymore. It'll be okay. How do you know? - They can not prove anything. The police are looking for her locker. Let's tell them. Do not be stupid. We get all three the debt has happened to her. We can proceed in the cell. - Exactly. I drove there yesterday. To see if she was hurt or something. That was not so. - That's good news. See? She's probably hitched with some guy or something. She'll be above water. Let's stick to the plan. We have not seen her right? Good morning, all. Sit down. Had a nice weekend? I have checked your keys. Later we take together the answers. And that is Alaska's gift to us. You're a genius Jacqui. If I Emmys would issue you got six. Go getaway to Palm Springs for a romantic weekend. That is difficult. Trevor and I have a break for Bianca. But she does still distant. Just when you think: Worse can not. - Believe me, it can always be worse. Pregnant with a 28-year-old heroin addict ... all day Bob Marley draws on beer cans on Venice Beach. As the youngest daughter of my brother. - How awful. But it cheers you anyway? Oddly enough though. - You see? I know what I'm saying. Which kid are we talking? - Are you starving? His name is Chad. With whom she rummaged that night? - The same. But no one says even 'scratching'. - What do they do? I think they say 'decorate' 'Score', 'win', 'mess'. You know we eat? An hour - They say still "scratching". Give me a break. We have six people talked ... that you and Dory inside have go down. Do not deny it. Okay, so you were together in that bathroom. Only. And when? Nothing. - Come on, we are not the morality police. All you prepared crack in a toys oven. If it is true. You were to scratch? Have you messed? Well, now we're getting somewhere. And when? - They went back and I went home. I have not spoken to her. - Not Saturday We were not a couple. It was just a mistake. That gave her to feel good. Where were you Saturday night? I have the afternoon played basketball, ate pizza and went home. Can your parents confirm that? - No. I live with my father. He was with his girlfriend. But you do not seem like a type on Saturday night stay at home alone. That's what I did. Not really at home. I sat for a while in my car. What did you do in your car? - Just chill I've had enough. Hold on, otherwise go to the police station. What I was getting stoned. So that I could handle my girlfriend to speak to. She was furious. How did you know? - She had me scolded by voicemail. Chad, did you voicemail accidentally saved? Mama. I called your cell phone. - I know that. So what? Hey, Gilson. I'll call you right back? The last time I saw Dory Friday was at school. Where were you Saturday? Saturday? I am away from my girlfriend Fallyn been home ... went to the mall and I walked around on my own. Everyone is now only on Saturday night. Did you buy something? - No, I just walked around. A cup of coffee or pack of gum? A receipt showing that you were there? I was there. But I did not buy anything. How did you get that scratch? I bumped me when I got into my car. Bianca, you find Dory nice? - Yes. I mean, she's not so bad. We can get along fine. Prima? Yes? So you were not mad at her when she creep around with your boyfriend? Gore liar. Did you really that I would not find out? If you thought I quietly that slut left sewing, you are wrong. Everyone will know, creep. I can be a bitch. Dory and you get what you deserve. "You deserved. That sounds like a threat. That was not it. - Enough. No more questions. Ms. Maller a classmate your daughter is missing. Do you understand that? A girl is missing. If she has any idea where she is, I know that. That has not. I will just exhaust? I see you, girl. Bianca, what the hell on? Why did you lie about Saturday night? - I did not lie. You told me that Sarah and Fallyn there were at the mall. I never said, Mom. I'm only gone, that's the truth. If you know anything about that girl, you have to say. Otherwise I can not help you. - I do not need your help, Mom. I do not know where she is. I did not do anything to her. But of course you do not believe me. Again - Hold on a moment, Bianca. I can be candid but that does not matter. That message does not prove anything. I threatened her, said the detective. - He wants to make just scared. Nothing connects us with her or that place. Do you simply plan, then blows it by itself. Do not you know how it is with her? No, she can not care me. I'm worried about us. To you, me and Sarah. You would also need to do. I do not want you. Snotlap - No, this is what I found in my car. Did you find anything else? - No. I got it. What happened to Bianca? - Nothing. She is fine. Okay, see you later. I'm so sorry. I'll tell you how it is. - Do not. Look there. What is that? I just called to say .... I do not really know. Is everything all right? Actually, no. I miss you. Very much. I miss you too. Jacqui, what's wrong with you? I almost had you called last night. Something strange happened with Bianca. Wait a minute. Here comes a spokesperson the police: The victim is found the 17-year-old Dory Holland. She was a few days deceased. We assume a murder. If you have any information about this case ... is to be included please contact with polltie of Westlake Village. What is it, Jacqui? Dory is dead. I just heard on the news. She is found in Wells Canyon. How did it happen? Not yet, they say but they think she was murdered. Bianca, what's happening? Do you know something about this? - I can not. The Honey, you have to. That detective will come back. You do not just make. Tell me. Please. It's my fault. Why? Fallyn, Sarah and I left her there. Why then? As punishment because she had slept with Chad. But this was not my intention. A hiker from Culver City found the body and called the police. Dory Holland was last seen at her home on Saturday morning. The police account with a crime. With Sarah. They found her. I know it. I watch the news. - What do we do now? Are you sure she was unharmed when you left there? You gave her only a push? - After she hit me. Hence the cut. She scribbled on and nothing was wrong. We must take this to the police. - No. Then they think it was me. Sarah and Fallyn can vouch for you. - But I would mention. Whatever you have promised, that girl is just dead. This changes everything. -. If that does not work Look, Bianca. If the police find evidence that you were there .. becomes much worse for you because you have not said it. You have to tell them everything. You were not allowed to leave Dory. But you did not kill her. What will you do? What is Fallyn's number? I call her mom. We ask them to come along. No, let me first talk with Fallyn. I'll call her right away. Good, but I call her mother once you're done. I have to tell my mother. She wants to come and talk to your parents. Why did you tell her? Bianca, we had a pact. I know it. I had no choice, right? I'm sorry. Fallyn ... - When do they come? Tonight. She'll call your mom in a couples of minutes - Fine. Stupid bitch. I have to tell you something, and I need your help. I can not tell dad Only you. Of course, darling. You know that you can lose everything to me You know that Dory was gone? - Yes. They found her. She's dead. My goodness. What horrible. That's not the worst. Claire, you have restored the house again? - Yes. Let's sit down. Sit down. Thank you. Sarah's parents could not come? No. I know that you wanted, but they already had plans tonight. I was gutted when Claire told she was found dead. The police seem to think to a crime. Bianca and I find that the girls the police should tell what they know. I do not understand it at all. They should explain why they took Dory ... but she was unharmed when she last saw her. Are you talking about Fallyn and Sarah? - Yes. Last Saturday? - Yes. Did not you tell them? - Fallyn and Sarah were here all day. I've ordered pizza and we watched DVDs. That's a lie. - Excuse me? Let your mother lie for you? You were there, it was your idea. The Dory paid up because Chad. Why would I want that? He is not even my boyfriend. Mom, you have to believe me. Have you seen them here Saturday? - I was out of town. Why do not you ask him? I told you they were with me all day. You're lying. You want all the blame blame it on me. Do you have brought up your daughter? - Sorry? To offend us in our own home - You can find me some. Wait a minute ... Calm down. Blanca, start again at the beginning. No. I want to have our house. How dare you speak against us? Claire ... - Immediately. Out. You know where the door is. How can you listen to? - I try to follow what is going on. Bianca wants to drag us into its trap. - You do not get to kick. You always solves everything fine on. You knew as well as how to deal with the FDA in DC. Fallyn, honey ... Why Bianca you want to give problems? You're one of her best friends. - Let mommy doing this over with. You have to tell me the truth. - Mom, she was there and Sarah too. If you do only was and do not dare to say ... I was not alone. That you let convince ... They are the ones who lie. Damn. What will you do? - Call Sarah. Hey, where are you? - Home. Fallyn's mother has called you you not to come? How do you mean? Did you think they would lie about where were you Saturday? I give my mother the phone. Say her what really happened with Dory. I can not. - Why not? I do not know. I watched a DVD at night do Fallyn. I have no idea what you're talking. I am suspected of murder. You must my mother tell the truth. That's the truth. I was not there. Are you okay? - Yes. Best. They also lie al Mama, I swear on my life they were there. I thank you so late could call. No point. You have the address? Beautiful. - I'll see you tomorrow. See you. That was the lawyer Trevor recommended. Tomorrow morning half past nine. Do not bother if you do not believe me. - Bianca, I want to believe you. But you do not. Do you? I wish Dad was still there. This has nothing to do with your father. It's about you and me. Since his death, there is like a wall between us. I'm sorry, Mom. I just wanted that you would forgive him. As if something had happened . As if the affair has never happened. It has happened. And it was not the first time. He had had an affair just when you were born. Why did not you tell me that? I wanted you to love him as the father he was ... and would not hate him for his mistakes as a husband. He loved you more than anything in the world. And I also. You know I did not do this. Dory bring to the ravine was mean and stupid ... and my biggest mistake ever, but ... I'm not a murderer. I know that. I believe you. No more corn chips. Is it so hard to fill a vending machine A moment. Yes ... And that was Saturday afternoon? Yes, I thought you should know. - Thank you. That was one Steve Hopkins. His pumping station is about 5 kilometers the place where Dory is found. Saturday afternoon and asked a girl in a silver Prius drove . for the key to the toilets, and they had a cut on her forehead. I know a girl with such a car ... - You're kidding. Call out our favorite judge? I have a search warrant. Would you let us in? Where does this come from? - What is that? I think that Bianca knows. It was lying on her back. I've never seen it. - Are you serious It corresponds to the pin Dory who wore that day. She has not been in my car. - You sure one? Or someone has him down there. - It must be. Bianca Maller, you're under arrest for killing Dory Holland. Is that really necessary? - Yes we can, Ms. Maller. You can come to the office. You have the right to remain silent ... I will be behind you to drive. Dory had slept with your friend, so wanted to teach her a lesson. Come on, you know the difference between a question and an accusation. One of them has a question mark. Right? What else but. Which hit you in her skull? Enough. My client has already declared she was not. More we can not say. - Oh, no? This is what we are going to say. We have a motive Dory's hairpin in Bianca's car ... and tomorrow we may also DNA and forensic evidence. What do you think about it is after that downpour? Do not forget the witness who saw her Saturday afternoon. Are you Bianca sue or not? - No. Because that would be premature. But we hold her to the trace evidence is completed. Can they do that? - Yes, that's allowed. Should I stay here? You come in provisional detention. I come back in the morning along. Do not worry. I'll come tomorrow. Everything will be fine. Premeditated murder? - Since they seem to be out. And incredible guarantee? - About 72 hours we will know more. Let's tell them about the other girls. They had an alibi, you say? - If you want to believe Claire Werner. And no motive as far as you know? - No. I would rather see the indictment and proof by taking. I'll call you later today. - Thank you. It's good. When she was little, we walked once Evening on the beach in San Diego. She was only six. Choir To Fish roe shots there. She picked them up from the beach and threw them into the sea to save them That does not surprise me. Total - She always had a good character Therefore I know she is innocent. I can not imagine that her friends so let her down From Fallyn I can believe it. That whole family is just weird. What about that other girl? She said the same thing to Bianca .... but she was always already says everything Fallyn. Might help her parents. I'll take him. Rita, hello. With Jacqui Maller. You got a minute to talk? It's Bianca's mother. Jacqui, I have spoken Claire. But you should not call. I want you, Sarah or Werners cause you any trouble. Bianca is held today ...
