When I was a senior in high schooI... aII I wanted to do was attend a famous bIack coIIege... and study journaIism. But my father had different pIans for my Iife. You're not going to one of those nigger coIIeges! You have the opportunity to go upstate to a good coIIege... and that is where you are going! No, I'm not! That's where you want me to go! I'm going to Southern Tech! No, you are not! Not with my goddamn money! You are not! We don't need yo, money! We don't need nothin' from you! You must think you grown, huh? You think you got this whoIe worId figured out. If you are that grown... you need to get the heII out of this house! Get out there and get a house of your own! No! She is not goin' anywhere! That's right! And don't come back... tiII you get some sense in you! Don't pay attention to what he says! Diana, he'll caIm down. Just wait. Honey! You got that baby! - Do you hear me? - Mama, I'm gone! So to show him... I got a IittIe apartment with my baby's father. And it was aII good untiI he needed his space- whatever the fuck that means. So instead of checking into Southern Tech that semester... I had to deaI with the reaI worId. That's when I met Tricks and Ronnie. Ain't you supposed to heIp me try these on? You need heIp? I ain't trying to get in your business... but can I ask a question? How much money you make working here? I make enough. Enough to do what? They couldn't pay me enough to smeII feet aII day. You couId be making a Iot more money... if you wouId just use what you got... to get what you want and forget this chump change. - What's that mean? - Just what it sound Iike. Don't be stupid, girI. Use what God gave you. y'aII some prostitutes? HeII, no. We dancers. Dancers? Where y'aII dance at? The PIayers CIub. The PIayers CIub was owned... by this Iow-Iife named ''DoIIar BiII''- aIways in debt. He was the one that gave me the name Diamond. He said 'cause my face was so pretty... but he never reaIIy Iooked at my face. How you doing? Hi. I'm Diana. DoIIar BiII. Kinda cute. A IittIe makeup... fix your hair a IittIe different. Turn around. Let me see. Damn, she got ass. You can start tonight if you want to. I got to caII the baby-sitter. AII right, then. They was cheap tonight. Just quit fuckin' with my shit! PIease! What's up, new booty? How you doing? Nervous. Don't think I can go out there Iooking Iike this. Yeah, you can. You just gotta Iearn how to reIax. Took around you. Everybody here is naked. Every girI was nervous their first night... but they got used to it. You drink? Here. Let me show you something. Try not to Iook at the customer. Just Iook in the mirror and dance sexy to the music. Pretend You're at home in your bathroom by yourseIf. That's it? And drink as much as you can as fast as you can. You might as weII get faded. HoId on. Where's my money from the party you did? I want my money, and I'm not pIaying. - Tet's go, ho. - What? That's what they about to caII you upstairs... so get used to it. Now, Iet's go, ho. When it was my turn to dance... I was shittin' bricks. I feIt Iike a mouse in a room fuII of snakes. What's up? That's it! Damn, baby! Work that shit! You want a dance, Miron? What you waitin' on, girI? You better get yo, money. My first tabIe dance... was the most degrading experience of my Iife. But after a few hours, and a few more drinks... I didn't even worry about it. The money was fast and easy. And I needed it. I tried not to Iet this cIub change me, but it has. You can't park there. I'm not the same person I was before. God damn it! I said you can't park there! I waIked in a young Iady and came out a woman... knowin' a Iot more about Iife. Like in this business, hounds can be maIe and femaIe. And I tried to avoid both. Excuse you. You better watch where you going! I had a four-year hustIe pIan that was the bomb. I wouId go to schooI in the daytime... and I wouId pay for it at night. I got aII the way up to my senior year... without getting caught in any buIIshit the cIub had to offer. I had Lance, my new boyfriend. And my father and I was even speaking again. Everything was cooI. At Ieast untiI... my 18-year-oId cousin Ebony moved here from TaIIahassee... a month before finaIs. And my mama toId her mama I wouId keep her out of troubIe. I said, ''Yeah,'' because she was my favorite IittIe cousin. - How are you? - I'm fine. Look at you. Come on in. Give me your stuff. Lance, this is my cousin Ebony. How you doing? After seeing my new apartment... she asked if she couId work with me at the PIayers CIub. Stripping business started in Africa. Long time ago... Iong, Iong time ago, white men went to Africa. And he saw aII these bootifuI bIack women... waIking around, singing... dancing, working, Iiving... in the nude. Bucket nekkids. You couId see they pubIic hairs. This white man went from viIIage to viIIage... to seek out these bootifuI bIack women. Watching them perform in the nude. Titties! Asses. Free. White man got a idea. He figure he go back to Europe... and start the same type of business... take away from my bIack womens. Try to get those white bitches to dance the same identicaI way. But to no avaiI. Wasn't no shame in our bIack women. Wasn't no shame in them waIking around bucket nekkid. So he went to Europe, tried to start the same thing. But it didn't happen. Those white bitches toId him the most bootifuI words... you ever wanna hear in our profession. What she say? Baby, those white bitches Iooked at that white man... dead in the eye and toId him, ''Fuck that. Pay me.'' That's why I get thirty percent. When can I start? ImmediateIy. Ebony jumped head-first into this IifestyIe. She wouId stay out aII night... and I wouId have to spend aII morning Iooking for her. Hey, girI. Have you seen my cousin? See you tomorrow, man. You got your bag? Yeah, I got it. Bye, Mama. Bye. Don't teII Grandma Ebony didn't come home. I know. And don't teII her she works at the cIub. Right. Very good. Give me a hug. See you Iater. Bye, Mama. Hi, sweetheart. - Grandma, me here! - That's my pudding. Come inside. I made you some chocoIate chip cookies. Wake up, DoIIar BiII! Shut up! Now, you open your mouth wide and say, ''Ahh.'' Open your mouth, nigga! Now what we have here is a faiIure to recompensate. HoId this. HoId the damn gun! Don't jerk your head. Got a hair trigger. WiIIiam DoIIar. You own the PIayers CIub. You borrowed $60,000 from St. Louis. You haven't made one payment yet. Mr. St. Louis is coming to your cIub... and he wants a payment of $10,000. If you don't pay him, he don't pay me... and I'm gonna take that reaI personaI and come get you. I'm supposed to get some pussy tonight. You make that payment... or Iisten for the pop. Maybe I shouId just bIam! It's gonna be a pop, fooI. Oh, my mama. ,Scuse me. Are you motherfuckers dancers? y'aII need to cIose the door and step behind the Iine. I ain't Ietting nobody in yet, partner. What's up, l'll Man? Why you trippin'? Don't you remember me from Iast weekend? - I remember you. - What's up, man?

St. Louis, what's up? TeII DoIIar BiII to bring me my money. He ain't in there. He went to the airport. He went to pick these girIs up. He shouId be back about 11:00 or 11:30. What you saying?

What's up? This dick. Hey, Diamond, what's up? I'm gonna go hoIIer at DoIIar. Hey, Diamond. Come here, girI. - Want something to drink? - I don't drink no more. That's right. GirI, good for you. Look...you taIk to your cousin today? Nah. She didn't come home Iast night. - What happened? - I'll Iet her teII you. But you know she was with Ronnie and Tricks... and you know how they get down. You shouId have never toId nobody that was your cousin. You know they was gonna try her. I'm supposed to keep her out of troubIe. Is she here yet? Downstairs. I'll see you. I just don't think It's fair... you charge me 250% interest on the money that you Ioan me... when you aIready take 30%% out of my check. I ain't got no G-string and no tips. WeIcome to the stripping game, partner. Look, you ain't nothing. AII you do is spin records. That's aII you do. Who you think you is, DJ quik? Kid Capri? You must be Jimmy WaIker. You ain't nothin'.

Don't speak to me. Don't Iook at me. I'll teII you what. You better go on back out there... and get out my face before you get swoIe. Hey, I ain't trying to come here... muscIe you, nothin' Iike that. I'll teII you something. BIue, if I raise up, gonna be troubIe. Go waIk it off. - Punk. - Fetus. Say, man, they came. Who? They Ieave somebody out there? Nah. I toId 'em you went to the airport. Good, good. That's good thinking. You was quick. You was good on your feet that time. Listen, go back out there and Ieave that side door open... in case I gotta do something reaI quick. Go on. You gonna ever pay 'em? Do what I teII you! Keep your eyes open in case something transpire!

So if you don't have my money, I'm gonna... So, what happened to you Iast night? I made me some money. That's nice. But aII money ain't good money. So how you make yours? WeII, Ronnie and Tricks Came up to me Iast night... and asked if I wanted to make some extra money. They knew about some party at the BeImont... and they wanted some dancers, so I went. But I heard it wasn't no maIes there. It was just femaIes. So, what'd you do? I danced for 'em. They was paying. That's aII you did was just dance? That's it. Whatever. That's what happened.

And it aII goes down here at the PIayers CIub. Miron, can I just do one dance? No, thank you. What you want, Joe, some SIim Fast? No SIim Fast, baby. I want some Henn. Doggy dog.

You'd rather shake your ass for some strangers... than spend some time with your man. That's not true. You know I'd rather be with you. You don't act Iike it. When you going to quit working at that dumb-ass cIub? Because I'm getting fed up with this. Was it a dumb-ass cIub when I met you there? Don't you think you want to put some cIothes on? For what? Lance? He ain't nobody. Come on. Let's go in my room. So, what do we do... when our mainstream media quotes our tabIoid media? What do we do? Investigate the subject for yourseIf. Don't trust anyone's research but your own. AIways question the information you receive. If it is the truth... it shouId be abIe to withstand the test of investigation. Don't forget- review chapters 27 and 54. The big day is coming. Excuse me. Miss Armstrong. Wake up! I am up. How wiII you pass your finaIs if you sIeep through my Iectures? I'm going to pass. How?

She toId me to make sure you stay out of troubIe here... and I toId her I wouId. For you and my mama's information... I don't need nobody watching me. I'm grown. I been watching myseIf for a Iong fuckin' time now... and if I want to make some extra money on the side... that's my business, not yours. It's your business. You right. But what you trying to do, make a career of this? Maybe. Everybody can't go to coIIege. Some of us got to use what we got to get what we want. Oh, pIease. Don't give me none of them Ronnie ho quotes. Just stay professionaI. You onIy been here 3 weeks... and you aIready getting sucked up- - Sucked up? - Yes. You aIready caught up, so what's the difference? I know what happened between you and Ronnie. They toId me. I'm fin to go back inside. Don't have to worry about me. I'll find a ride home. Make the money. Don't Iet it make you. He crazy. So, what's up? What eIse you want to see? He want to see you go down. How much? Six hundred. No probIem. Make sure you give them their money's worth. Drunk bitch. Why don't you put that crossword puzzIe away... and come on upstairs earIy? You wish. I'm back. I didn't feeI Iike working tonight. Is Ebony working at that cIub with you? No. Who toId you that? JamaI. He toId me she was dancing with you. You caII that dancing? She come by the cIub sometimes, but she don't work there. You caII that work? Don't start with me tonight, Daddy. Dang! Excuses, excuses. I hope you don't have that girI working in that cIub with you. It's bad enough you doing it. My sister wouId have a fit. I can hear her mouth now. WeII, Mama, I wish the next time... you voIunteer my house to your sister's kids... you ask me first. Excuse me, Miss Thing. I thought she was your favorite cousin. Look, Diana, sometimes famiIy has to heIp famiIy. Just Iike you dropping JamaI off here every other night. Just keep her away from that bar. I don't want to hear nothin' about her being in that bar. I can't stop her from doing what she want to do. You better find a way. Look... I know what your cousin probabIy been teIIing you about me. This ain't the same thing. I worked with these peopIe before... and you my protege... so I know you'll bIow their fucking minds. So what's up, rookie? You trying to get money or what? What you waiting on? The PIayers CIub? Don't get me wrong. It's cooI getting those trick-ass niggas... to pay you ten doIIars to see you dance naked... but me and you both know... sometimes you got to work too hard for that ten doIIars. They be wanting you to do too much. ''Bend over.'' ''Spread your Iegs.'' ''Stick your butt out.'' ''Come on, back end bounce for me.'' Nigga, what? AII of that for ten doIIars? You can stick it out at the PIayers CIub if you want. You going to mess around and be just Iike Diamond's ass. Four years going to be done passed you by... and you going to be riding around in a Honda Accord. You scary as heII. You bony. You probabIy onIy going to make enough money... to buy yourseIf a Honda Civic. I'm going to teII you the truth... because I'm tired of fucking around with you. In this business, CIosed Iegs don't get fed... and It's as simpIe as that. It's men up there, right? No women? Look, I'm not trying to turn you out. I'm just trying to turn you on to some game. Hey, baby, how you doing? Great. I can't compIain. The wife's stiII a pain in the ass, though. I,ve cIeared everything with DoIIar BiII. Tricks is here, but the boys been waiting on you aII night. Good. I hope they brought some money with them... because I brought a new moneymaker with me. Where we changing? Right upstairs. Come in. Come in, girI. Yes, that's right. Show me the money, baby. I'm gIad Tricks brought the right outfit. GirI, what the fuck is this shit? It's the party. No shit. They the poIice. I ain't fin to dance in front of them oId-ass white foIk. Hey, Ebony, you trippin'. Them white foIks got green money. Get dressed, aII right? AII right, you white motherfuckers. AII eyes on me. If I catch you Iooking at anything eIse...
