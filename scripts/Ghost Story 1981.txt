A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT, THE OLD CARETAKER WAS AWAKENED BY A TERRIBLE SOUND; WHIMPERING, PITIFULLY. THE SOUND CAME AGAIN, FAINTLY. ONLY THIS TIME HE WAS SURE IT WAS HUMAN. THE GRAVEYARD WAS SILENT... EXCEPT FOR THE STEADY PADDING OF HIS FEET... AS HE WEN AROUND THE TOMBSTONES. "HELLO ? IS SOMEONE THERE ? SOMEONE ?" BUT THERE WAS NOTHING. NO ONE. AS HE STOOD THERE, SCRATCHING HIS HEAD, FEELING SOMETHING OF A DAMN FOOL, HE HAPPENED TO LOOK DOWN. AND THERE AT HIS FEET, SOMEONE HAD BEEN BURIED... THAT VERY AFTERNOON. THE GRAVE HAD BEEN DISTURBED. THE SOIL WAS UPSET, AND THE CROSS LAY ON ITS SIDE. "RESPECT," HE MUTTERED, SURE NOW THAT HE WAS THE BUTT OF A PRACTICAL JOKE. SO HE SMOOTHED OUT THE SOIL... AND SET THE CROSS BACK UPRIGH AT THE HEAD OF THE GRAVE, AND THEN HE WENT BACK TO HIS BED. BUT OUTSIDE, IN THE GRAVEYARD, IN THE WIND, THERE WAS STILL A FAINT WISP OF SOUND, ALMOST LIKE A SONG: "ALIVE. STILL ALIVE !" AAAH ! "ALIVE." GOD. MARVELOUS STORY. MARVELOUS. I THINK THA WAS THE WORST SHOCKER WE'VE HAD IN YEARS. DAMN NEAR SCARED THE PANTS OFF ME, I'LL TELL YOU. WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I COULD DO WITH ANOTHER BRANDY. HEAR, HEAR.
