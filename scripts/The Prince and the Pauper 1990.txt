England was ruled by|a wise and good king... and the people flourished|and were very happy... but by-and-by.|the good king became ill... and a darkness fell over|the countryside. As the king grew weaker... his captain of the guard.|a ruthless and greedy man... saw his chance to terrorise|the people of England... and worst of all.|in the king's name. It seemed that no one could|save the kingdom of England... from the thieving captain|and his ruthless henchmen... until one day... Kindling! Kindling! Fresh kindling! You can't cook dinner|without a fire, can you, sir? I know, fella.|I'm hungry, too. Snow cones! All kinds, sir.|We got plain, mud, and twig. Hiya, Goof. How's business? Gawrsh, Mickey, if I don't get|a customer soon... I'll have to eat them myself. Don't feel bad, guys. Come on, fellas,|secret handshake. Ooba boola boola boola! Swing it up! One of these days,|we'll eat just like the king... with lots of turkey and ham|and potatoes and con. Yeah! And ice cream|and cookies and pie! Fruit tarts and cobblers|piled this high. # Oh. Give me a suckling pig # # To make my belly big # # I'm just a little guy # # Give me a pizza pie # # I have a happy face # # Next to the fireplace # # I'd like a hat to wear # # And thermal underwear # # It would be appealing # # To have that royal feeling # # Doing everything # # A little bit like a king # - Like a king!|- Like a king! # Just a little bit|like a king # # I # # Just a little bit like # # Just a little bit,|little bit like # # I would love to live|just like a king # # Captain Pete,|Captain Pete # # Captain Pete,|Captain Pete # # He never met a man|he didn't cheat # # Cheat, cheat, cheat # # He's the vilest villain|that you'd ever want to meet # Pluto! No! # Quite a cad, super bad # No! Pluto! Pluto? Pluto? Who goes there.|and what do you want? Gosh, I just want|to get my dog back. He ran in before|I could catch him. Your Majesty, do come inside. Thanks. What do you think this is,|open house? Captain,|that was the prince. Then who's that, numskull? Now to review, sire. All triangles|have three sides... and the relations|between these sides... are known as ratios. Trigonometry is|the branch of mathematics... Sire, if you could give me|your full attention. Name the three secondary|trigonometric ratios. You may begin. Cotangent... secant... Who did that? What is it? Cosecant! Sire. We've been through|this time and time again. It's hypotenuse. Hypotenuse! Now, Donald,|I'll have you know... that I don't find|your behaviour amusing at all. If the prince is to assume|the royal duties... No! He started it! - Donald!|- Aw, fooey! I'm always getting in trouble|for that stupid prince. And as for you,|Your Highness... you know|that your father is ill... and requires rest and quiet.|Now, sire... Beat it, you dumb mutt! Get out of here!|Let go of my leg! Captain! What's the meaning|of this outburst? Just some|local riffraff, sire. Even the lowliest subjects of|this kingdom deserve respect. Have him brought to me at once. The prince wishes to see you. Allow me. Put me down! Wow! Hiya! # I'm just a little guy # # Give me... # What the devil's|going on out here? Donald, if this is|your idea of humour, I'm... You look just like...|I thought you were... Wait, wait, wait.|Just a moment. Now, who are you?|And who is your tailor? The name's Mickey. Mickey Mouse,|Your Royal Highness. A beggar boy. Mickey, I must thank you|for saving my life. Saving your life? I was about to die of boredom. Do you know what|it's like to be the prince? Boy, it must be fun. Never a moment to myself.|Breakfast at 7.00. Lessons till lunch... fencing till tea time... and every night, banquet|after feast after banquet. Wow! And then 9.00, bedtime. Beddy-bye. How I envy your freedom. Games all day long... no studying|dreary old books... staying up late as you like,|eating junk food. If I could take your place|for just one day... Yes. What a grand idea. Don't you see?|lt'll be perfect. I'll take your place|in the streets of London... and you shall be the prince. The prince?|I can't be the prince. How do I act?|What do I say? You needn't worry, lad. To goven, you need to say|only one of two things... "That's a splendid idea.|I'm glad I thought of it!" and "Guards, seize him!" But your father, the king... I'll be back|in the wink of an eye. And if there's any trouble,|all may know me by this. Wow! I'm not sure|this is a good idea. You'll do fine, Mickey. Why, you're looking|more royal already. Good-bye, Mickey. You won't forget|to come back now, will ya? Well... good-bye. Hello, Captain. Ah, my little peasant. Embarrass me in front|of the prince, will ya? Peasant? Captain, I fooled you.|I am the prince. Forgive me, my royal liege. How thoughtfuI of you,|Captain. I live to serve. Sayonara, sucker! I did it! I'm free! I am good! I fooled him. For now, nothing's|going to spoil my fun. Hey, Mickey!|There you are! Ah, my first encounter|with the peasantry. Where'd you go, Mickey? Come here, you little nut. Noogie, noogie, noogie! Give me that|secret handshake, Mick. Put your hand up here.|Swing it now. Oh, yes. That is me... Mickey Mouse,|peasant at large. My good man,|you must forgive me. I'm dreadfuI with names. Could I have your name? What's the matter|with the one you got? I'm Goofy. Remember? So I see.|And, my dear man... if there's anything|I can do to help... by all means,|let me know. Oh, I get it! It's a joke. That's a great one. Will you look at the time?|I really must be going. Ta-ta! Hey, come back here! Come back! Gosh, if my friends|could see me now. Surely His Highness has|not forgotten his royal duties. You'll pay for this!|Leave her alone right now! - Get away from her!|- Help me! Relax, lady.|It's for the king. - Yeah, the king.|- But it's all we have. Then it's all we'll take. Halt!|As your royal prince... I command you|to unhand that hen. What's so amusing? Forgive me.|I think you forgot your crown. When I retun to the palace,|you'll pay for this! I can't believe it.|Stealing in the king's name. This happens all the time. The king takes all our food.|We're hungry. Outta the way, you slobs! Make way for|the royal provisioner. Out of the way.|Come on, move it. What are yous. Deaf? Halt! I am the prince... and I command you to surrender|your entire inventory. And I'm the queen mother.|Be off with ya. Will this help? - It's the prince!|- Your Highness! # Give me|a suckling pig... # Now, where can he be? For you, sir. There he is. Thank you, sire. Gawrsh,|Mick's flipped his wig. Alright! Clear out!|Out of the way! He's the one what|showed me the ring, sir. You there,|you're under arrest. Run for it, boy! Hang on, Mick! I'm comin'! Oh, that's rich. Now, I may be losing|my mind, Captain. And I know that you've said|that time and time again... but all I know is|he acted like a nobleman... and he had the royal ring. The ring? So it was the prince|I booted out. You threw out the prince? # You're gonna get it # Not if he doesn't|come back alive. Take that!|Take that! And that! Enter! Oops! Nice shot, sire. Your Highness, your father|is in his last hours... and wishes to see you at once. We better tell the prince.|He'd want to see him. You are the prince, sire. I've been meaning|to talk to you about that. Sire, he is gravely ill. I'll explain everything.|The king'll understand. - My son...|- Huh? - I'm not really the...|- Come closer. My son, from the day|you were bon... I have tried to prepare you|for this moment. I shall be gone soon... and you will be king. You must promise... promise me that you will rule|the land from your heart... justly and wisely. I promise. I gotta find the prince. Good day, my phoney prince. - Unhand me!|- Shut up! Now that our dearly departed|king is out of my way... you're gonna do|every little thing I say. 'Cause if you don't... - Pluto!|- Get the picture? You there, what's happened? The king is dead... and the prince|is to be crowned at once! Father. Your soup's almost ready, Mick... I mean, Your Majesty. Now it's up to me to right|the wrongs I've seen... children going hungry,|corruption everywhere. Gawrsh, you really|are the prince, ain't ya? Sire, your wish is my command. Goofy, I owe you my life. This will not be forgotten. Come, friend. We must retun|to the palace at once... For a visit to the dungeon,|my prince! Get him, boys! En garde! Let me go, I say.|How dare you? You'll pay for this, Captain! I command you|to put me down right now! After the pauper's crowned,|it will be adieu for you. Let me out of here! I'm the prince's valet! Your Highness! We're saved! Wait a minute.|You're in here, too. We're doomed! The coronation! My lord. This charade|has gone on long enough. I demand that you open|this door immediately. Shut up! Huh? Looks like the boss|ain't wastin' any time. Be my guest, pal. What's the big idea? Sorry. You wouldn't happen|to have an axe I could borrow? Thank you. I've had a lovely evening. - Gawrsh.|- Goofy! Just sit tight, little buddy. I'll have you|outta there in a jiffy. Be seated, sire. After you. No, no.|Beauty before age, sire. Oh, no. Age before beauty. Your Highness,|you're such a sport. - Sit down!|- Got it. Let me see. Was it|the skinny one or the round? Maybe it was this little... Get 'em, boys! Gawrsh, that thing's sharp. Oops. It is both|my duty and pleasure... to crown you... I say,|you're a rather wiry lad. So slippery.|Would you hold still? - Stop!|- What the...? I'm the prince, right? And whatever|I order must be done, right? Uh... yes. Well, then, the captain|is an insolent scoundrel. Guards, seize him! Seize him!|He's an impostor! But I'm not, Captain! Thank you, guardsman. Oh, boy! Wait a minute, Your Majesty. I can explain everything. Very well.|I await your explanation. Your Majesty is too kind. Look out, sire! Geronimo! Hold on, sire. I'll... I got you now, you varlet! Fooled again, Captain! Out of my way! Oh, boy,|am I glad to see... I mean, what a time I've... Ah, but, you see, I... Good heavens,|which one is which? Pluto! I guess there's|no fooling you, boy. Therefore, I crown you|Prince of England... I mean, King.|King of England. # Everybody. Sing # # A toast to the king # - To the king!|- To the king! # To His Majesty the King # # I # # Long live the king # - Yeah!|- Gawrsh. And so with|his loyal companions... Mickey and Goofy.|at his side... the young king|ruled his happy country... as he'd sworn he would... with justice|and compassion for all. Old Icky. If you recall.|was the country schoolmaster... dreamed up|by Washington Irving. He had a way with a yarn|did Mr Irving. If we could|but journey back... to that remote period|in American history... when the city of Manhattan|was but a market town... we would discover in the bosom|of one of those spacious coves which indent the shores|of the Hudson... the little village|of Tarrytown... and just beyond... nestled deep|in the low rolling hills... a sequestered glen. It's a quiet. PeacefuI place.|and yet somehow... foreboding... for it abounds|in haunted spots... twilight tales.|and local superstitions. The best-known story.|however... concerns a certain|itinerant schoolmaster... who once frequented|these parts. Indeed. Some say|his melancholy spirit... still haunts the vicinity. The worthy pedagogue|was described... as a most unusual man. To see him striding along... one might well mistake him|for some scarecrow... eloped from a cornfield. He was tall|and exceedingly lank. His head was small|and flat on top... with a long snipe nose... so that it looked|like a weathercock... perched|upon his spindle neck. Altogether. Lhe was|such an apparition... as is seldom to be seen|in broad daylight. It was late one drowsy|autumn afternoon... when this strange figure|first approached... the tranquil little village|of Sleepy Hollow. As usual.|there had foregathered... at Ye Olde Schnooker|and Schnapps Shoppe... a group of rustic lads known|as the Sleepy Hollow Boys. Their self-appointed leader.|one Brom Bones... was a burly.|roistering blade... always ready for a fight|or a frolic. And though Brom was much given|to madcap pranks... and practical jokes... still. There was no malice|in his mischief. Indeed. With his waggish humour|and prodigious strength... Brom Bones was quite the hero|of all the country 'round. Odds bodkins! Gadzooks! Look at that|old spook of spooks. # Who's that comin'|down the street? # # Are they shovels.|or are they feet? # # Lean and lanky # # Skin and bones # # With clothes a scarecrow|would hate to own # # Yet he has|a certain air # # Debonair|and devil may care # # It's the new|schoolmaster # # What's his name? # # Ichabod # # Ichabod Crane # # Ichabod # # What a name # # Kind of odd # # But nice just the same # # Funny pan. Funny frame # # Ichabod.|Ichabod Crane # # Ichabod may be quaint # # May be odd|and maybe he ain't # # Anyway.|there's no complaint # # From Ichabod.|Ichabod Crane # And though the arrival|of the pedagogue... gave rise|to mixed emotions... the townspeople all agreed|they'd never seen anyone... # Like Ichabod.|Ichabod Crane # The schoolroom|became Ichabod's empire... over which|with lordly dignity... he held absolute sway. Truth to say. Ichabod|was a conscientious man... and ever bore in mind|the golden maxim... "Spare the rod|and spoil the child. " Still. Lhe was carefuI|to administerjustice... with discrimination. For it behooved him to keep on|good terms with his pupils... especially if their mothers|happened to be good cooks. # Who's the town's|ladies' man? # # Gets around|like nobody can # # Has to be|none other than # # Ichabod.|Ichabod Crane # Thus. As time went by.|it may be seen... that the pedagogue got on|tolerably enough. Moreover. Ichabod|found diverse ways... to increase|his slender income... and at the same time... awaken the cultural interests|of the sleepy little village. It was inevitable|that such a man as Ichabod... would become|an object of ridicule... to Brom Bones|and his gang. And yet to Ichabod.|these were small matters. Indeed. The schoolmaster|possessed... a remarkable equanimity... which remained|quite undisturbed... until that fatefuI day... when his path|was crossed by a woman... a certain woman... Katrina Van Tassel... daughter and only child|of old Baltus Van Tassel... the richest farmer|in the county. She was a blooming lass... plump as a partridge... ripe. melting... and rosy-cheeked. # Once you have met|that little coquette # # Katrina # # You won't forget|Katrina # # But nobody yet|has ever upset # # Katrina # # That cute coquette|Katrina # # You can do more # # With Margaret or Helena # # Or Ann or Angelina # # But Katrina|will kiss and run # # To her.|a romance is fun # # With always another one|to start # # And yet when you've met|that little coquette # # Katrina # # You've lost your heart # Now. There was no doubt|the fair Katrina... was the richest prize|in the countryside... and the schoolmaster.|being an ambitious man... at once began to fill his mind|with many sugared thoughts... and hopefuI suppositions. Ah, Katrina, my love... who can resist your grace... your charm... and who can resist|your father's farm? Boy, what a set-up. There's gold in them acres,|and that ain't hay. Not to mention|that lovely green stuff. Katrina, my sweet,|my treasure. Treasure...|That ban's a gold mine. How I'd love to hit|the jackpot. Dear Katrina... Papa's only child. Papa! The old goat|can't take it with him... and when he cuts out,|that's where I cut in. Sweet Katrina.|Poor little rich girl. Don't worry, Katie,|Ichabod will protect you. Yes, Katrina, you've won me.|I surrender. # And yet when you've met|that little coquette # # Katrina # # You've lost your heart # Truth to say. Every portal|to Katrina's heart... was jealously guarded by|a host of rustic admirers. Ah. But Ichabod|was confident... he'd soon ride roughshod over|these simple country bumpkins. The most formidable obstacle|of all. Lhowever... the schoolmaster|failed to reckon with. That was the redoubtable|Brom Bones himself. Now. The ease with which Brom|cleared the field of rivals... both piqued and provoked|the fair Katrina... and she often wished that|some champion would appear... and for once|take the field openly... against the boisterous Brom. And though a wiser man would've|shrunk from the competition... Iove. They say. Is blind... and Ichabod was aware|only that Dame Fortune... was at last thundering|at his door. It's true that Brom liked|a joke as well as the next... but enough was too much. It's time to carry the issue|to open warfare. Why. Lhe'd double|that schoolmaster up... and lay him on a shelf|in his own schoolhouse. But this. It seemed.|was easier said than done. No doubt of it.|this was Ichabod's lucky day. It was evident|the schoolmaster... was indeed a man|of hidden talents... a rival to be reckoned with. Still. Wars are|neither won nor lost... with the first encounter. The high-flying pedagogue|might be brought to earth... for Brom Bones was never|a man to cry quits. It was upon the occasion... of her father's|annual Halloween frolic... that Katrina again chose|to stir the embers... of the smouldering rivalry. Thus one invitation|in particular... carried a most personal|and provocative summons. The worthy schoolmaster|was in a transport of joy. To him. This could mean|but one thing. Icky, you sly old dog, you. What is this strange power|you have over women? Tonight's the night, boy. Just tun on the old charm... and fair Katrina|is yours for the asking. So gaily bedecked and|nobly mounted upon a horse... he had borrowed|for the occasion... Ichabod issued forth|like a knight errant of old... to keep a tryst|with his lady fair. In all the countryside... there was nothing|to equal a merrymaking... at Mynheer Van Tassel's farm. To Ichabod. Lhere was a perfect|field for his endeavours. Now. Indeed. Would he put|his best foot forward... for beyond|all his other talents... the schoolmaster prided|himself upon his dancing. The unhappy Brom.|already bested at every turn... saw himself|once more outmatched. For as he watched|the posturing pedagogue... he was forced to admit|that here... here was a flawless picture|of ease and grace. There was no doubt that Ichabod|was the man of the hour. Brom knew that|he must concede his rival... still another victory. And yet. There was still|a chance his time would come... for when the hour grew late... Van Tassel always|called upon his guests... to tell him ghostly tales|of Halloween. And Brom knew there was|no more firm believer... in spooks and goblins|than Ichabod Crane. Just gather 'round,|and I'll elucidate... on what goes on outside|when it gets late. 'Long about midnight|the ghosts and banshees... they get together for|their nightly jamborees. There's things with hons|and saucer eyes... and some with fangs|about this size. - Some are fat.|- And some are thin. And some don't even|wear their skin. I'm telling you, brother. It's a frightfuI sight... to see what goes on|Halloween night. # When the spooks have|a midnight jamboree # # They break it up|with fiendish glee # # Ghosts are bad.|but the one that's cursed # # Is the Headless Horseman.|and he's the worst # # That's right # # He's a fright|on Halloween night # # When he goes a-joggin'|'cross the land # # Holdin' his noggin|in his hand # # Demons take one look|and groan # # And they hit the road|for parts unknown # # Beware. Take care.|he rides alone # # And there's no spook|like a spook that's spurned # # They don't like him.|and he's really burnt # # He swears to the longest day|he's dead # # He'll show them|that he can get a head # # They say he's tired|of his flamin' top # # He's got a yen|to make a swap # # So he rides|one night each year # # To find a head|in the Hollow here # # Now. Lhe likes 'em little.|he likes 'em big # # Parted in the middle|or a wig # # Black or white|or even red # # The Headless Horseman|needs a head # # With a hip hip|and a clippity clop # # He's out lookin'|for a top to chop # # So don't stop to figure|out a plan # # You can't reason|with a headless man # Now, if you doubt|this tale is so... I met that spook|just a year ago. Now, I didn't stop|for a second look... but made for the bridge|that spans the brook. For once you cross|that bridge, my friends... # The ghost is through.|his power ends # # So when you're ridin'|home tonight # # Make for the bridge|with all your might # # He'll be down|in the Hollow there # # He needs your head|Look out! Beware! # # With a hip hip|and a clippity clop # # He's out lookin'|for a head to swap # # So don't try to figure|out a plan # # You can't reason|with a headless man # It was the very|witching hour of night... when Ichabod pursued|his travel home. The sky grew|darker and darker... as one-by-one the stars|winked out their lights... and driving clouds|obscured the moon from sight. Never had the schoolmaster|felt so melancholy... so utterly alone. And the nearer|he approached the Hollow... the more dismal he became. Once inside the murky glen... Ichabod's anxiety|increased one hundredfold. For now the forest seemed|to close in behind him... and every small detail|of Brom's awfuI story... returned to haunt|his recollection. Ichabod! Ichabod! Ichabod! Headless Horseman.|Headless Horseman. Here he comes! Beware! Beware! Once you cross that bridge.|my friends... the ghost is through.|His power ends. The next morning.|Ichabod's hat was found... and close beside it... a shattered pumpkin... but there was no trace|of the schoolmaster. It was shortly thereafter|that Brom Bones... led the fair Katrina|to the altar. Now. Rumours persisted|that Ichabod was still alive... married to a wealthy widow|in a distant county. But of course|the good Dutch settlers... refuse to believe|such nonsense. For they knew|the schoolmaster... had been spirited away|by the Headless Horseman. # With a hip hip|and a clippity clop # # He's out lookin'|for a head to swap # # So don't try to figure|out a plan # # You can't reason|with a headless man # Man. I'm getting outta here!
