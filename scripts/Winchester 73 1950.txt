I heard it took over a year to make it! Yeah! They give the first to President Grant! I'll sure be in good company when I win that one! We've hit a lot of towns, Lin! What makes you think he'd be here? He'll be here! We've been wrong before! He'll be here! On account of that? If he isn't here already, that gun'll bring him! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Stayin' overnight, mister? Maybe! We'll board your horses! Two bits in the corral with grain feedin'! Four bits to stall 'em! Real clean stall? Yes, sir! You can look for yourself! You look like an honest man! Here! I'll take your word for it, mister! I don't care! Let go! Let go! You've got no right to treat me this way! I'm not doing anything now that I haven't been doing for the last six months! -Just till over the Fourth! - Why don't you pick on the gunslingers... and the tinhorn gamblers instead of a girl tryin'to make an honest dollar? What about Steve? You know I'm expecting him any minute! If he comes to town and finds I'm gone, he's liable never to catch up with me! Come on! Oh, no! Is there something I can do for you, ma'am? - Stranger in town? - That's right! But I was talkin' to the lady! Yeah! Well, don't fret about it, Lola! If Steve comes along, I'll send him on after you! Thanks, anyway! Get up! Hyah! Lola's all right! It's just that some folks in town!!! think the dance hall girls might give the place a bad name over the holiday! Not that I'm one of them! You boys plan to stay for a while? We might! Dodge House about the best place in town! Might be full up, but I'll put in a word with Jake! Oh! Might as well drop off your guns here at the office! Let's have 'em! - Now, wait a minute! You must have a real good reason to ask a man to do a fool thing like that! We don't allow anybody to wear guns in Dodge City! Hadn't you noticed? - Who's ''we''? - Oh, didn't I introduce myself? Well, where in the-- Where'd I put that thing? I had it here someplace! A man could get himselfkilled hiding his badge like that. I'm the marshal, Wyatt Earp! Oh, well! Come to think of it, everyone did look kind of undressed! Yeah? Hmm? Virgil, here's some more guns! Take good care of'em! You're gonna get this office so cluttered up with six-guns!!! a man won't have a place to spit! We got half the guns in Kansas hangin' on the wall right now! An awful lot of law for one little cow town! This is the kind of cow town that needs a lot of law! You boys gonna try for the Winchester? I sort of thought I would! You'll have some tough competition! Who do you think is the toughest? Well, uh, as of now, uh, Dutch Henry Brown! You ever hear of him? No! Can't say I recall the name! Local boy? No! I'd say he was sort of in on a pass! You can sign up for the shoot over there! That's Dutch Henry Brown! I thought you said you didn't know him! I said I didn't recall the name! Pick out a name and write it down! All right if I use my own? Some folks do! Yeah, some folks do! Lin McAdam, that'll be two dollars! Bein' as you're a stranger and nobody knows nothin' about you, I'm just gonna make your odds five to one! I'll take a little of that! And who would you be? High-Spade Frankie Wilson! With a hyphen! That's what I sit on when I get tired! Friend of yours? I wouldn't exactly call him that! Personal matter? Yeah, very! Have you got any goat's milk? Ain't cow's milk good enough? Give it to our cat! Don't hurt her! This personal matter, I hope it can wait till after you fellas leave town! It'll wait! Oh, uh, for the!!! gentleman at the end! From the gentleman at the far end of the bar! Let's have a nice, quiet Fourth ofJuly, shall we? We're about to begin the proceedings. Right this way. All right! Gentlemen and ladies, today, at our centennial celebration, we are going to make history here in Dodge City! My old man shoots a Henry, and he says it's the best gun there is! Gentlemen, if you please! Ain't no better than a Spencer! When the Winchester people-- A Spencer's better than anything you can get! Young men, dry up! Without being unkind to either the Henry or the Spencer, do you suppose we could agree that this is the finest gun in the world? Can I touch it? You can, if you keep shut till I get done talkin'! All right! Fellas, this is what you're shootin' for! Take a good look at it and say a prayer! Pass it along for the others to see! That's real pretty! Mm-hmm! While the contestants are examining the prize to be awarded to the winner, I'll tell you something about it. It seems when the Winchester people are turning out these here guns, every so often, maybe one gun out of every ten or twenty thousand, well, it comes out just perfect! Now, naturally, it ain't for sale! I would give a year's wages for that gun, but money won't buy it! It wouldn't be right to sell it! So the Winchester people, they have given it a name. They call it One of a Thousand, and that's a good name. President Grant has got one and Buffalo Bill Cody. And today, you're going to see one of these here men win something... that I would give my right-- that I would give my left hand to own! If you folks'd behave yourselves, I could give my right hand! However, that is the prize! All right! First group, pick up your rifles, get your shells from Bat Masterson and the sheriff here!!! and take your position on the firing line! Rules for the contest are!!! three rounds of three shots each to an elimination! High score wins! Over there, boys! Hold your rifles! Ready, boys? Aim! Fire! One bull's-eye and two in the first for number five! One bull's-eye, two in the first, number five. Three bull's-eyes for number six! Three bull's-eyes, number six. Better check it. It's a real tight group. You call it luck, or do you come by it natural? Let's just say I learned from a good man! Three bull's-eyes for number seven! Three bull's-eyes, number seven. Almost the same grouping. Huh! Hmm! Looks like you fellas might've learned from the same man! He taught quite a few folks how to shoot! Only trouble was, he taught him how! He didn't teach 'em what to shoot at! Maybe he figured a man should know that without tellin'! Yeah! That was his big mistake! He lived just long enough to find it out! Huh? Well, all right! Next group up to the line! All rounds being completed, the decision of the judges is!!! a tie between Lin McAdam and Dutch Henry Brown! The targets-- The targets will be moved back 25 yards! You all right? - Yeah! Find out where he put up his horse? Right next to ours, next to Wells Fargo! Don't try anything, not with Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp around! You gotta wait, Lin! - I'll wait! Pass the cartridges. Ready? Lin McAdam! Three in the bull's-eye for Lin McAdam! Henry! Dutch Henry Brown. Three in the bull's-eye for Dutch Henry Brown! Looks like we could move this target clear to the next county!!! and they'd still be shootin' even! Wait a minute! See if he can hit this! Huh? Suit you? Sure! All right. - Ready? - Uh-huh! Plumb center! Here, I'll put up this time! I wouldn't want to play my hand on borrowed money! All right! You ready? Whenever you say! I've never seen the beat of this shooting! Well, it's not plumb center, but it is a good hit! Well, wanna try again further off, McAdam? Hmm? Further off? Oh, sure! Might get a little expensive though! Say, uh, you want sell? Uh-huh! How much? One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! I thought I had him beat! Yeah! See what you can do with that! Anything you say! All right, Dutch Henry? All right! A miss! Looks like another miss! I wouldn't wanna say you're wrong, Marshal, but I didn't miss it! I don't see any mark, except maybe this scratch on the inside rim! That was my mistake! I shot through it! You missed it! Can I borrow this for a minute? Yeah! I'll do it again, if you want! You mean, you want another shot? Is that it? No, not exactly! I'll tell you what! If I hit it, I win! If I miss it, I lose! You don't have to shoot! Don't go makin' any such fool deal as that! If you're gonna have to shoot, he's gonna have to shoot! I'll take that bet! Lin McAdam says he's goin'to shoot a hole... through this here postage stamp! Are you ready? Uh-huh! The winner! Fine shootin'! Thank you! The boys would like to engrave your name here on the gun stock! So if you let us have it, you can pick it up in the morning! That's real nice of'em! I appreciate it! How much will you take for it? It's not for sale! That's too bad! That's too much gun for a man to have just for!!! shootin' rabbits! Or for shootin' men in the back! If it's all right with you, I'll get my gun! You mean you're pullin' out of town? Yeah. All right! Get your gear and stop by the office, and Virgil will let you have your guns! And see that you get out of town! I guess I won't have time for that engraving! I suppose! You're pullin' out too? That's right! All right! I wanna congratulate you! That was real fine shooting! Thanks! You pick up the guns and the horses! I'll get the stuff out of the room! I can't think of anyone I'd rather see own that gun, except maybe me! Fine! Fine! Thank you! You understand I don't care what they do to each other once they leave town! But there'll be no gunfighting-- I understand perfectly! And I promise you there won't be! All right! Virgil, did Dutch Henry pick up his gun? No, he didn't pick it up! I think this is his! I thought he was gonna come by! Why and how could he come by and pick it up if it's still here? Sometimes you don't make sense! Of course he didn't come by, or I'd have seen him! Dutch! It's Wyatt Earp! It's Earp, and he's got a gun! Let's get out of here! Lin! I don't know what your quarrel was before, but you can add the rifle to it now! Yeah! Yeah! I don't know about you, but after two days, this saddle's pounding the back of my neck! Why don't you run up and hit him over the head with it? What I wouldn't give for a pocketful of shells! While you're at it, dream up a few for me, will you? And a six-gun to go with it! I ain't felt so naked since the last time I took a bath! You got a long memory! A funny man, huh? But I still want a gun! You'll have one as soon as you get down to Riker's! Maybe he'll buy you a bath too! There's more smoke!!! up on the saddle back! Yeah! Take a look! Can you read it? I don't have to! Injun smoke always means the same-- trouble! You think they know about Custer? All I know is, I wanna get my business done and get outta here! If you were smart, you'd do the same! With what? Mine doesn't come as easy as yours! Then why don't you try it my way? Or is that too rich for your belly? Call it that if you want! There's some things that even I wouldn't sell to an Indian! Are we gonna quarrel? Howdy, Dutch! Been a long time! Anybody inside? Fella named Lamont! Indian trader! Did you come far? Far enough! Notice much smoke on the way? Looks like they're working up a sun dance! We're hungry! This is Joe Lamont. Dutch Henry, Johnny and Ben. Looks like you might have been in Dodge City and left in a hurry! Was that meant to be funny? He's all right, Dutch! Just that he notices things like guns! You sellin' these? Yep! You a half-breed? I'm white, and you haven't got a gun! That's right! So I'll buy some of these! I might even get one that was meant to kill a white woman!!! or her kids! It's empty! How much you got? Less than $20! I left the rest in Dodge City at 5 to 1! You? Uh, 7.58, 9. I went for the whole kit. We'll take three six-guns and some 44-40s for my Winchester! What'll it be? - $300! Three hundred? Why, you two-bit thief! I ought to wrap 'em around your neck! A six-gun doesn't bring better than $25 anywhere in the territory! - Does for me! - Why-- Wait a minute, Dutch! You got no call to insult this gentleman! Gentleman! All right! So he's an Indian trader! I know of a lot worse things! What, for instance? That you're not gonna get the price down that way! I'm sick and tired of goin' around naked! Dutch, we need guns! We got $82! What'll that bring? Mind if I look at your Winchester? I can use a four-pound steak! Or will that cost 300? No, I get my beef cheap! Have one on the house while you're waiting! One of a Thousand! I've heard of'em, but this is the first I see! Play your red six on the black seven! The red six! Thanks! I'm not much of a hand at cards! Just killin' a little time until Young Bull sends his man down! Yes, sir, that's a real fine gun! Don't suppose you wanna sell? I'm buyin', not sellin'! Your black jack on the queen! What's Young Bull doin' this far north? I wouldn't know! But he wants guns! They all want repeaters since the Little Big Horn! Thought I'd clean up and get out! Might go ranchin' up Montana way! What happened at Little Big Horn? Haven't you heard? Sioux jumped Custer! Wiped out his whole command! Yes, sir, gettin' to be mighty tough country to travel!!! without a gun! So I see! Now, that gun there, I'd be willing to give you 300 in gold!!! and let you take your pick of six-guns and repeaters! Might even throw in 50 rounds of shells! Move your king over and get 'em all up! I'm not tradin'! You're about ready to fall outta that saddle! Why don't we rest up for a little? I'm not that tired! Four or five hours ain't gonna make any difference! We've been chasin' him since-- since I can't remember! That's right! We've never been this close before! It might just be that Young Bull's man won't show up! Might be! You'll be stuck with those guns! Yeah! After that meal, I'm down to $80! That's still enough to play poker with if you fellas want cards! I lost one place that way! Since then I've reformed! Well, I'm not much at poker myself! Still, if it's only for a dollar or two-- Who knows? You might win another 20 and have the price of one gun! That the idea? Three guns, if your Indian friend doesn't show! Well, cut! First jack deals, anything opens, right? Do you mind? No, not at all! Your deal! Drink? Would it do any good for me to suggest that we bed down for a while? Nope! That's what I thought! When do we sleep? As soon as we get to Riker's, we'll sleep then! Could be Dutch didn't go to Riker's! Wyatt only said if he was Dutch, he'd go to Riker's, providin' he was goin' to Tascosa, which is only what somebody said they heard Dutch say where he was going to! I think you better spit! Huh? Spit! Just wanted to get your tongue straightened around! You know what I mean! That's the reason we're goin' to Riker's! Come on! Call! Three kings! I've heard of beginner's luck, but I didn't know it could be this good! That clean you out? Yeah! At least we ate! I'm about to give mine back! I could act like an Injun trader and lower the price, but I won't! Offer still goes-- 300 in gold for your Winchester, whatever you pick! No deal! I'm a very patient man, but you're talkin' like a fool! Give him the gun! - I said no deal! - Be smart! It's a long, hungry ride to Tascosa without money! Again, I don't wanna sound like an Injun trader, but with all that smoke in the hills and you with no guns-- Why don't you shut up? The man's right! Give him the gun! You bought a gun! Now all I need is a beaver hat and I'll be dressed for Easter! I'll be happy to find one of these things that works! No wonder the Indians try to shoot around trees! Your deal! Aren't you ever satisfied? Not till I get my gun back! Deal! Want me to pick out one for you, Dutch? Find one that won't crack open in my face! You got any Winchesters? Ah, there's nothin' here but a bunch of junk! I won't need a rifle! Just get me a six-gun! It's gonna cost you 300 to draw cards! Well, we weren't playin' for that kind of money! Playin' table stakes, aren't we? Three hundred to draw cards! Well, I may be foolish, but I feel lucky! How many? I'll play these! Now I don't feel so lucky! Your bet! Give me your guns! Oh, no! Table stakes! Aces full on eights! Just missed being a dead man's hand! Not enough! Four threes! Drop it! You hadn't ought to done that, Dutch! You know I run a decent place! One on the house before you leave! - Who said I was leaving? - You're leavin'! Don't forget your shells! You may need 'em! Open 'em up! Young Bull, sorry to see you all wearing war paint! What's the matter? Trouble between the tribes? We will look at the guns! They are old, worn out! They are not the guns of which we spoke! I'll admit they're not Winchesters, but everyone's a repeater, and they'll all shoot true! You lie! If you were a white man, I wouldn't take that! But you're an Injun, so-- Yes, I am an Indian! So it is wise to listen in silence while you wait to cheat me! All white men are thieves! In peace, they steal our land! In war, they kill our women! And you are a white man! If you want my gold, bring me the guns with which Crazy Horse and the Sioux of the north!!! made their war at the Little Big Horn! Then you know about Custer, huh? This is gun I want! There isn't enough money in your whole tribe to buy that gun! This is gun I want! There's a thousand in gold and my gun! You missed him! If I did, he's deaf! That's the trouble with these old Henrys! Takes 'em too long to kill! Let's go down and get a gun that does it right now! I don't think it was a bullet! I said it wasn't a bullet! Why do they always scalp when they kill? You'd think they'd let a man keep his hair! Never mind his hair! Some Indian's got my gun! He said he was going to Tascosa, huh? To meet up with WacoJohnny Dean, which, in any man's language, means trouble! I'd say good riddance! You see, it's like I said! When Wyatt told me if he was Dutch, and if he was going to Tascosa, he'd come by here! But that was only what somebody heard Dutch say where he was going to! Uh-uh! Anyhow, I was right! Mm-hmm, you were right! Thanks a lot! You've been real friendly! Let's move along! You mean you're gonna get up and ride away from all this comfort? I know! We've never been this close before! It's better than a two-day ride into Tascosa! Sure you won't stay here for the night? Thanks, no! We'll ride! Yeah! On account that it makes much less sense! Have it your own way. But keep your eyes open along the ridge. See ya! Good luck! If I had been there-- Wyatt Earp or no Wyatt Earp-- they wouldn't have run you out of town! It doesn't make any difference! You found me, didn't you? I don't like it! I may just tell him so next time we meet! Well, you're not gonna meet! Not unless he comes out to our ranch! Is it a pretty place, Steve? Uh-huh! It's the old Jameson place! About 40 miles outside ofTascosa! That wheel is enough to drive anybody crazy! I should have greased it back at Doan's store! Can we move right in and start living there? Yeah! You can! What about you? Well, like I told you, I gotta meet some fellas! It'll only take a day or so! It's-- Well, it's a deal! Oh, please, Steve, please, no more deals! That's why I worked in Dodge City! That's why I got the money! That's what I mean! You got the money! Now I gotta get some! Steve! Can we outrun them? I don't know! I don't know! Come on, boy! Hyah! Hyah! The wheel! Hyah! That wheel, it'll split off!! Hyah! Hyah! Steve, what are you gonna do? Ride ahead and find help! - Steve, what about me? - I'll get help! Hyah! Steve! Steve, come back! Steve! Stella, come on! Come on! Cavalry in the valley! Come on! I'm sure glad we run into you! Are ya? Mind if I help you down, ma'am? Do you mind if I kiss you? No, ma'am! I'd like it! Providin' your man don't mind! That's for saving my life! Now you disappoint me! I thought it was 'cause I'm pretty! Got some coffee boilin' on the fire! Wanna just sort of help yourself? Oh, coffee! You know, now that I look at you, you are pretty! Never thought I'd have a woman around when I cashed in my chips! What? You don't know about them? And them? Them Indians been keepin'up pinned down all day, waiting for those reinforcements you brought in! Figured you knew, till your lady kissed me! Guess you'd better tell her! Yeah, I hear 'em! I told you night ridin' wasn't smart! I guess you did! Now we're smack in the middle of'em! I guess you're right again! Bein' right ain't gonna do us any good! What'll we do now? Now? Keep ridin'! With Indians all around us? Maybe you'd feel better if we stopped! Mmm, no! Well, maybe we'd just better keep on ridin'! It was such pretty hair! I had it ever since I was a kid! A little thin on top, but I'd sure like to keep it! Come on! Come on! Wrong way, Lin! We're headin' right into their camp! That's no Indian's fire! It's too big! Come on! Pour it on! Here they come! You'd best get under the wagon! I can shoot! But I don't want you to get hurt! Fire! Hey! Stop that fool shooting! We're friends! Don't shoot! Hold your fire! Name's McAdam! Thanks for leaving the door open for us! This is High-Spade! Glad to see ya! I'm Wilkes! This is Steve Miller! How are you? How are you? He and his lady came calling a little earlier! You got a woman here? They jumped us on the rim too! Well, hello again! Hello! Do you know him? Not exactly! We just sort of met without talkin'! He's the fella I told you about who offered to gun Wyatt Earp for me! I didn't know it was Wyatt Earp! I don't like to break up this gabfest, but we make a wonderful target!!! standin' here in front of that fire! You men, what are you looking at? Keep your eyes where they belong! They'll be coming in any minute now! At night? That's the best time for a raid, isn't it? Let's hope they wait until I have a cup of coffee! Got any cooking? I'll get you some! You from Fort Bascom? That's where we're headed! Replacements! New in the territory, huh? Mm-hmm! Pennsylvania Ninth! Picked up our mounts at Fort Smith! Been ridin' ever since! Pennsylvania Ninth! You fellas were at Gettysburg, weren't ya? Mm-hmm! Left a rib there! Oh! One of them Johnny Rebs hung me up on a bayonet! Real group of fightin' men! Never knew when they were licked! They give us a real bad time at Shiloh and Bull Run. Say, about these Indians, seems like they hardly ever attack at night! - Why? - Well, they figure if they're killed in the dark, the Great Spirit can't find their souls and whip 'em up to heaven! Something! I-- I, uh-- I don't mean to be forward, Sergeant, but if you've never fought them before-- Keep talkin'! You ain't forward! Well, it might be a good idea for your men to catch up on some sleep! - They're gonna be real busy in the morning! - How many sentries? Oh, two oughta be enough! You men turn in, get some sleep! Coates, Murphy, take the first sentry duty! Call your relief in four hours. I see you've done my chores for me again! Yeah, you can say thanks! This cavalry, a little on the young side, most of'em! What do you guess for our chances? What chances? This is a little softer than the ground! That's real thoughtful of you! Thank you! My woman's got yellow hair! Did have yellow hair! It's white now! Where is she? Home with the kids! Got one bigger than you are! Go to sleep! Hey, Mossman, you awake? Yeah, I'm awake! Pretty, isn't she? I don't like yellow hair much! My wife has brown hair with red in it! I hope the kid has brown hair with red in it! You see, this'll be my very first own home! Not that I didn't have a nice home, but this'll be my very own! You know? I know! - Did you have a home like that? - Sort of! With your wife? No, I haven't got a wife! Oh? No, it was with my father! Is that where you're going now, to your home? No! My father was killed! Oh. They're pretty, aren't they? Sometimes they sing all night. I know what they are! Maybe you'd better try and get some sleep, huh? I can't sleep! Can you? Yeah! I mean, if I tried, I could! Aren't you afraid of tomorrow? Would it do any good for me to lie to you? No. I'm afraid! I guess everybody gets afraid sometimes! Yeah, I guess so! Yeah! And I made you some coffee too! I'll do the same for you someday-- tomorrow! How soon do you think they'll come in? Anytime now! Hear them talkin' first! You know, I was chattin' with a fella out in the territory, name of Riker! He was tellin' me about how the Sioux, under Crazy Horse, wiped out Custer! Clever fighters, those Sioux! It seems they knew all about your Springfields being single-shot! You mean they had repeaters? Yeah! They sent in the first wave light so it'd draw the fire! Then they sent in a heavy second wave before the Custer men had a chance to reload! You think these fellas have repeaters too? And they'll try the same trick? Yeah, I kind of think they will! Only this time, we just might outfox 'em! - On account of we got two Winchesters! - And a Henry! You'll save your fire for the second wave? It's up to you, Sergeant! Whatever you wanna do! - Sound all right to you? - I guess! Round out, you men! Go to your places and take 'em as they come in! Take care of the girl! Take out those pistols! Yeah! Morning, ma'am! Good morning! I fixed you a spot over yonder under the wagon! That was nice of you! That saddle was real comfortable! That's good! Say, uh-- Just in case you, uh-- I know how to use it! I understand about the last one! They'll be comin' down in about three more whoops, Lin! What do you pick for our spot? Well, they'll come in under the sun! Let's get up to the other end of the wagon! Let 'em have it! Let's concentrate on the chief! We get him, we might have a chance! All right! This is the big one! It's all or nothin' this time! So long, partner. Good luck. And one other thing, Sergeant! Out here we play winner take all! No use leaving all those repeating rifles lying out there to rust! Never thought of that! Go out and pick up them fast-shootin' guns and anything else that you happen to like! You're a man after my stamp! Wish we'd have had you with us at Bull Run! We might not have run so fast! I wanna tell you something! I was with you at Bull Run! So was High-Spade! Only we was on the other side! Good luck, Sarge! Good-bye, boys! See you again! - So long, Sergeant! - Lin! Before you go, this is yours! Oh, yeah! The last one's still there! Well, so it is! May I have it? You just never know when a girl might need a bullet! Sure, if you want it! I want it! Hey, Sarge! Look at this! Look what I found on this one! Oh, he was their chief! I saw that Lin fella drop him! Real pretty shot! Well, now! ''Dodge City Rifle Shoot Won By--'' It don't say who won it! Do I get it? No, some officer would take it away from you at Fort Bascom! It's too good for an officer! No, it rightfully belongs to-- Hey, Lin! Steve, I hope you won't think this is second best, but one of you fellas oughta have this! That's a real fine gun! Take it with the thanks of the U! S! Cavalry to protect your lady! And I wish it was a Congressional Medal for Bravery! You earned it! Help you in, ma'am? That one's 'cause you're real pretty! Good-bye, ma'am! Good-bye, Steve! Bye! Bye! This is theJameson place? That's right! That garden you were talking about-- we could plant it over there! Maybe you wouldn't want a garden! Would you? I don't know! Maybe you don't want to go in! I'll go in! Sort of nice, isn't it? You'll like it after it rains! Gets green, and there's water in the run! Oh, hello, Mr! Miller! You got back real soon! Yeah, I did! This is Miss Manners, the lady I was telling you about! Oh, how do you do? Come in, won't you? Hello! Jimmy-- that's my husband-- he's in town! Sit down! I'll fix you a bite to eat! Oh, uh, we don't want to cause you any trouble! Oh, no trouble! None for me! I have to go into town! But if Miss Manners could stay-- You're not going anywhere till I fix you some supper! Now, sit down! Hello! Hello! Hello! What's your name? Bonnie! And what's yours? Gary! Cute kids! They sort of go with the place! Sort of! As soon as we get married, you'll be wanting kids! They got plenty of room for it here! Bonnie, Gary, come on up here! Don't bother the folks! Oh, they're no bother at all! Come on! Gary! Steve, why do you have to go into town? I've got to meet a fella! Who? WacoJohnny Dean! You don't know him! I know about him! He's no good! That's 'cause you don't know him! Do you like this? I don't know! It's on account of what I did back there! Steve, I'm not sure! I won't lie to you! I went yellow! Crazy yellow! It-It came over me all of a sudden! But I came back for you! You know I came back for you! I'd-- I'd give my eyes if it didn't happen! And someday I'll prove it to you! Waco! Well, hello, Steve! What kept ya? Roan, Latigo, look who's here! Yeah, I saw him! How many was there when they started? Twelve, I think! There's only nine now! Eight! Nine! I make it eight! Aw-- What a pair! Well! Hello! You live here? She's with me! Her name's Lola Manners! I told you about her! Yeah, but you didn't tell me she was, uh-- Hello! Steve, what's all this about? It's old home week in Texas! Happens every Saturday night! Steve, you want a laugh? While we were waiting for you, we jumped over to Hays!!! down in the big blue, just for jokes, and who was there? Noonan the marshal and a dozen men from the Triangle Bar! You have no right to come in here! You got any coffee? I said-- And I said, you got any coffee? Waco? Waco! There's a woman and youngsters in there! Send 'em out the front door, and we'll hold our fire! Then what? Then you can come out too. Under arrest, but I'll promise you a fair trial! And if I don't come out? Then we'll gun you out, and you know we can do it! All right, now! Send that woman and her young 'uns out! Come and get 'em! All right, but remember, you asked for it! Where's the coffee? You're about the lowest thing I've ever seen standing in a pair of boots! Why don't you let this woman out of here! She hasn't done anything to you! And these kids-- You ought to be ashamed to look at them, you two-bit, four-flushing gunslinger! Well! Why don't you stand in back of her!!! when Noonan starts gunning? I want to see it, remember it, so I can tell my friends about WacoJohnny Dean, another brave man! They're coming out, Noonan! Go! Not you! Remember, you want to see this, you want to tell your friends! And I want you to tell it right! Waco, are you coming out? She didn't mean all that! Let her get out while she can before they start coming in! They won't come in! But this is the only chance she'll get! Where did you get that gun? I won it! Let's see it! I'll buy it! I'm not sellin'! Name a price! Make it big! I'm not sellin'! All right, Steve! Have it your way! Cook up some coffee! Coffee? With Noonan sitting out there? I'll make it! Let him do it! I know bett-- I said, let him do it! You don't mind, do you? No! I don't mind! Send out that other woman, Waco! And we want her now! Yeah! I can see his point! But she likes it here! Come on! Sit down! We've got lots of time! Have you, uh, known him long? Long enough! Aw! No bad habits? No, just bad company! Maybe we can change that! I'm a likable person when you get to know me! Are you? And you're a lot of woman! Too much woman for, uh-- Hey, Waco! They're bunching up around the barn! Mind if I take care of them? Oh, you'd miss! You know how I hate noise! What was I saying? You were talking about yourself! Where did I stop? You didn't, but you can now! I already know about WacoJohnny Dean, the fastest gun in Texas! Texas? Lady, why limit me? This one I can't miss. Lenny, Nick, gather up some brush!!! and out it on that rig and head it right for the center of that house! This is what I want-- coal oil! David, fill them buckets up with this here, and bring 'em outside, and hurry! Coffee's ready! Well, bring it on! Put an apron on! He'll look better! Coffee? What are you trying to prove? Nothin'! Just trying to buy a gun! You sure you don't want to sell it to me, kitchen boy? You can serve us next, waiter! I like mine black! Steve, give him the gun! Can't you see what he's trying to do? Coffee's ready! Ah, clean it up! Clean it up! No! Steve! Steve! I tried to-- Get ready! Let her go! Waco! I believe it's time to go! And walk into those guns? Would you rather fry? Last man out is a fool! Run for it! We'll go this way! It's shorter! Easy does it! Why don't I take one of the other horses? Guess why! Look! He's gettin' away! Yeah! Don't shoot! Can't you see that's a woman? When do you figure to hit Tascosa? Around 2:00 or 3:00 tomorrow! I remember when you were taught that trick! Long time ago! Yeah, long time! Did you ever wonder what he'd think!!! about you hunting down Dutch Henry? He'd understand! He taught me to hunt! Not men. Hunting for food, that's all right. Hunting a man to kill him? You're beginning to like it. That's where you're wrong! I don't like it! Some things a man has to do, so he does 'em! What happens when the hunt is over? Then what? Well, I hadn't given it much thought! Maybe we could get the ranch back together again!!! and round up the strays, and then we can-- I haven't given it much thought! Now might be a good time! On account of we're coming pretty close to the end of the trail! Yeah, I guess maybe you're right! You've been fine people, riding along with me! That's what friends is for, isn't it? Leastways, that's the way your dad always said it! Yeah, he did, didn't he? He said if a man had one friend, he was rich! I'm rich! Oh, now we're playing games! Cute little echo, huh? Your echo's confused! This time it's Dutch Henry! Hey, he's got a woman with him! Maybe that's what kept him! As though I didn't know! Sometimes I think he's a little on the crazy side! Yeah, so do I! But I think quiet! Howdy, Dutch! John, Dan! Hi! Ooh! Want to come along? I wouldn't leave you for money, bright eyes! Boys, this is Lola! She's crazy about me! Where did you get my gun? Your gun? This was given to me by a very dear friend! It's my gun, and I want it! And if you don't get it? Do you want in on this Tascosa deal? I didn't ride out here to pick blueberries! Then I'll say it again! That's my gun! Well, as long as you feel that way about it, the gun is yours! Where's Long Tom and Dudeen? Didn't they show? They're inside sleeping! Rode in late last night! Where's Latigo and the others? Um, they're not here! Got themselves all shot up! How come? Oh, it's a long story! With tears! I'll tell you over a drink! Haven't I seen you somewhere? I've been somewhere! In Dodge City! You were playing a piano and, uh-- Singing! Yeah, that's why Earp ran you out of town! Who plays the piano? You? Sure! Roll one out and I'll toss off a tune! I'll take you up on that as soon as we get to Tascosa! Which by the way happens when? Today! Today? What are we sitting around here for? We won't be for long! Now, here's the setup! First, John, Ben and I ride down to Trygillo! That's here! And when we get to Trygillo-- Take a walk! You heard what I said! Take a walk! She's doing swell right where she is! Now, uh, what happens at Trygillo? Nothing! Oh-ho! He doesn't like you! Well, don't tell him now, but I don't like him! Get smart, and I'll crack you across the ear! Look, Waco, this time tomorrow you and her can play pat-a-cake all you want! But when I line up a deal, I don't want any dance-hall woman listening in! Why don't you cook up a few eggs for the man you love, huh? In other words, take a walk! Just a very short one! Uh, nice place you got here! How would you like to rent it out for our honeymoon? Here's the layout! We pick up the stage at Trygillo! Now, there's four men riding, guarding the gold! They'll ride it to Tascosa! That's here! Where will I be? In Tascosa, with Dudeen and Long Tom! Right across the street from the bank, there's a saloon! Dudeen and Long Tom will have the horses tied off... in front of Jenkins Bar. Now, after they carry the gold into the bank, the four guards ride on to the livery stable. You stand at the bar, and you'll see the stage when it pulls in! At the piano! Lola's gonna play for me! Aren't ya, honey? I know! Take a walk! What else do you know? Nothing! So I'm in the saloon! What happens then? The stage pulls in, they take the gold into the bank! I go with 'em! You go into the bank and make your play, and if there's any trouble-- I cover you from the saloon, hmm? That's right! Get started as quick as you can. Come on. Did you help yourself to that too? It was given to me!!! by your friend in the picture! Do you know him? I know him! Then we've got something in common! He's been trying to give me one of those for a long time! - You're a strange person! - Am I? First you kill a man to get that gun! Then you just give it away! Oh, I'll get it back from old debts! The same way I got it from old Steve! Hey! That's all right! It's better than all right! Take your hand off your gun! We got no quarrel! Haven't we? That business with Steve? Oh, he wasn't for you! I did you a favor! Thanks! Maybe someday I can do the same for you! Did you love him? I guess I did! You two had a lot in common! Yeah! A lot of woman! I wasn't trying to be funny! When you talk like that you are! Or didn't you know he was yellow? I knew! You kill me! You want a drink? No! You mind if I get one? I don't mind! Your clock right? Little fast, I think! The stage is due at 3:00, and it's always on time! Oh, looks like you're full up! Yeah! Looks like! Isn't that-- Isn't that, uh-- Well, hello again! Well, hello, nice people! What are you doing in Tascosa? Well, let's put it the other way around! What are you doing here? Oh, playing the piano! I never woulda guessed it if you hadn't told me! Where's that Steve boy? Drinking whiskey? He's dead! - Sudden, wasn't it? - Very! He was killed by that gentleman standing at the bar! The one who's looking at us. Ha! Don't seem right for people to go around killing nice folks like that! He's not people! He's WacoJohnny Dean! Riker told us Dutch was riding to meet-- WacoJohnny Dean! Yeah! You haven't got a chance. Don't quarrel with him. I got no quarrel with him! Lin! Watch his left hand! I been ridin' to meet up with a man name of Dutch Henry! Whiskey, will ya? Hopin' to run into him here in Tascosa! Wouldn't happen to know him? I may! How long do you know him? Long enough to tell you how he got that scar above his right eye! I gave it to him when he was 10! Now you want to give him another? Ahh! Where is he? Supposing I don't tell you? Then what? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? I'll take you to him! When? Right now! Lin, look out! He's walking you in-- Lin! Tom, the horses! It's Judge Henry! - Lola! Get out of the way! Where are you hit? In the arm! You little fool! Here! Here, Lin! I'll take her! She's hit in the arm! Don't let him go! Oh, why'd you let him? Dutch Henry's a murderer! I know, ma'am! So does Lin! It was Dutch who killed his father, so it's right for him to go! Doubly right, because Dutch Henry is Lin's brother! The old man taught you better than that! You're caught below another man's gun! I guess I forgot! Matthew! Don't mind my calling you Matthew, I hope! I like it better than Dutch Henry Brown! Matthew McAdam! Has a good sound to it! I guess that's why the old man gave it to you! You got yourself in trouble again! I can smoke you outta there easy! First chance I had to thank you for-- for winning me my gun! Shoots real pretty, wouldn't you say? I didn't get a chance to use that gun, Matthew! But I intend to! There's something you forgot too! The old man told you never to waste lead! Now you're short! Not that short! Well, that's the way it was! The old man sired two sons! One was no good! Never was any good! Robbed a bank, a stagecoach! Then when he came home and wanted to hide out, the old man wouldn't go for it! So Dutch shot him! In the back! Lin!
