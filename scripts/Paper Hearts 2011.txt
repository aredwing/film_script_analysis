Hey it looks like you socks. I left my bag behind, before. Your mum is going kill me if she finds out how we got lost. Come on. Where did you leave it? This is where I last had it. But we only in here minutes ago, so where is it? I'm sure this is where I last had my bag. Definitely! You must have left it back in the shop we visited earlier. Come on. Come on! Your mum will be here soon! I won't be able to see you next week if we are late again. No. All right, its okay! Why can't you just be like everyone elses dad? Hey look! We are not going to find your bag, are we? Why don't you show me where I can buy one just like you. No. Its okay. You don't have to. Just show me, will you? Who taught you to punch like that anyway, Ricky Hatton? That one. You don't have to you know. It's okay. No, I want it! I'm your dad. I get some money from the cashpoint. It won't be a minute. Well, I don't want to wait here. You just wait there. And hold the bag. I go get the money. Its the last one. You make sure no one buys it. You sleep here? No! You make it worse. Go away! Where does it hurts? Can you wiggle your toes? Okay. Show me moving your ankle. I don't think you broken it. It's probably just a bad spraining. Lucky your head is not marked up. Let see if you can stand on it. Why didn't you tell me? I thought you disown me. I didn't want you to see me like that. I meant to be your dad. You are my dad. Okay. Come on peg leg. Lets get you back to your mum. The End
