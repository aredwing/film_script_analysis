All of them are beautiful I'm just making one with onyx. - Have you got more? This one. Look, this is like the one my grandmother gave me and I gave it to my sister Margherita on her wedding day. Do you remember Yes, I remember. - Beautiful. Do you like it? Yes I do. With two kind of gold. Chiara? The sight of him filled my existence from the time I was a little girl; He was always elegant and kind. He had very beautiful hands. And lots of money. His father was crazy about him. He wanted his son to be a gentleman and he was serious about it. His father planned to turn all of his business interest over to him And they were numerous. I well know, I was his advocate. It comes from France, it's good. This time you bought in grand style. It was my son's doing. "Buy this for the ladies and that for damsels... French fashion!" Careful! That stuff is delicate. This year I have things to satisfy every taste. No my purse is empty. We'll have to go over some account. And this? - That's special... upstairs'. And what is the French fashion? It's velvet with gold embroidery. I recommend it. It raises the spirits. Les gaufrettes! Room for me! - No, you dirty my water! It's wonderful! - You think you left so clean? Flanders lace! I bought it for you... He grumbled, of course... That's not true! I paid, didn't I? - Thank you! You tell him, too, that he can stay home. We do our share, in any case. If I have to leave in this city I have to take the bad and the good weather. Let the nobles deal with it. For once you can take the advantage of not being one of them. But you with you were one of them and they are fighting. That's all they know how to do. Perugia will win. You can bet on that. They are better armed and more ferocious. Francesco... - Aren't you going to eat? I have finished. They're waiting. - Just a moment... But you have hardly eaten a thing. Now at least have some wafers. Ah, you made them! Something for you. Give it to me! - No, to me! I want it! - Give it to me, to me! Should I write those things? - Yes, write them. You could have bet one thing: he would have become a great businessman. Less cautious than his father, but more alert to trends. His father had a craze, he really wanted to become a noble. Not really, his craze was his son. Events came to a head... It was a ferocious war and ended in slaughter... As I foreseen, Perugia won and Assisi lost her finest youth... For days no one knew who was dead and who had remained alive... Give them everything they ask. We know the jails. It's impossible to survive in there. All right, let me think about it. - No... There are other prisoners from Assisi. At least forty, it seems. it would be best to negotiate a general ransom. No! No! - That's how it's usually done! No, I want separate negotiations, just for my son! Even if it costs more. You can't ruin yourself however. - First let's hear their demands. Everything. Give them everything. Everything that's necessary. Of course. But keep calm. Tonight nothing can be done. Am I right? Nobles, out! Nobles, out! Come on, hurry up. Out of the way! Stand back! You're not a noble! They're being slaughtered. Because no one has come to claim them. Keep moving! Move! - There's nothing you can do. Perugia is faithful to the Church They come from the North and they proclaim themselves messenger of justice. But they spread only hatred and revolt! No, don't close your eyes, open them! The enemies of the Church are the enemies of Perugia! heretics who want to come here and stir up trouble. Look! We know how to deal with them! - What is it? This is our ways with the godless. It's a Gospel... not in Latin. - In what language? Our spoken language. That poor heretic probably translated it. Throw it away. It's dangerous. - Later. The negotiations were endless. Francesco was prisoner for almost a year. Stop that! - Leave him alone! Here life isn't worth a thing, your sleep isn't worth anything either. You're wrong, first they sold the dead meat... now the living. Do you have someone who'll pay for you? - Maybe, if the price is low enough. And you? - My father. I bet your friend has someone who'll think of him. Isn't that so? Hey, you there! Man of learning! Will you tell us who are you? Me? I'm a great prince of the region. And when you speak to me, bow your head or... Francesco started to behave oddly and his father was very upset about it. He blamed the year spent in prison on it. And most of all, he didn't like that job and he couldn't decide what to do. Fortunately a great Lord turned up in Assisi to recruit the sons of the rich. There was a great plan for conquest in Apulia. A unique opportunity for young men seeking glory and adventure. To become a knight was his dream and naturally he responded to the summons. That was the second time I saw him. He was as mixed up as a child. This one? - No, the other one, the next one. Look... This is the latest fashion among the ladies of Provence. You were saying? Excuse me, you were saying? This is the latest fashion among the ladies of Provence. Go away! Go away! Go! Go! Just add up. Including last purchases makes... let's see... seven houses in Assisi. Three in Foligno. Rented. Six barns, five oil mills. The commission on the slaughterhouse in Foligno... Four dairy... - Interesting... Fifteen farms. Plus the grazing land and the handling of the cattle Here's the schedule of cash receipts and payments. I already told you about the weaving and dyeing factories. Ah! While you were away, your father employed more dyers. Yes, yes, now let's go to the book of wonders! Your father has also started an activity of loan at interest. It's legal, but it's better not to make it too public. You suggested to sell on credit and I sell money on credit. Yes... all the details. What's mine, is yours Francesco! Chiara, come on! Why are you doing this? They're in need. You do it for your own good. And you? What do you do? I do nothing. That time he hurt me. Was I being charitable only because I had been taught to? Were my actions habitual and not spontaneous? Who was I? What did I want. Do you know I'm leaving? Where are you going? Maybe... Jerusalem. If you have to go off with a lord like that... you have to be fitted out properly. Beside our armor, we have to provide a horse. With suitable trappings, a squire with mount, all of our provisions. It will cost as much as two farms. But that doesn't bother me. Because you'll win the family a coat of arms! You are both mad! Think of the risk! You've barely regained your health! This will loosen the catarrh. If you don't risk, you gain nothing! Your mother is right. You're still in a daze. How can I be... It's my only chance. A second separation from their beloved son was difficult for his parents, but they wanted a brilliant future for him. # Because I have a lady with cook and scullion, maid and companion... Look! A leper... Get out! Get out of there! Get out! Francesco! Go away! No! - Francesco! Do you want it? - Of course... It's yours. But what about you? My horse. Sir! Francesco! What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to conquer the word? It's done. Can you lend me some clothes? I can't go back to my house like this. Have you been robbed? - No. What happened to you then? - Nothing. Really nothing. Honestly... - Don't you believe me? I don't understand you. Didn't you want to become a count or a duke? And now? What will your father say? Will you be back at the counter? I don't know. Is there a woman behind this? That one who... No. Do you still have that book? You know The one of that character that they... Do you need it? I don't know. What happened to you? What are you doing here? Have you forgotten where your home is? Where is your armor? Your horses? Wait! - Don't hit me! Wait! Are you crazy? Are you sick too? It's all right... It' all right... it's all right. No... What need is there to go to Foligno? to sell these things... Aren't you going to wait for your father? There's no time. Someone's waiting. - Who? A customer? Don't worry. Don't worry. He sold the cloth to give money to those in need. He started living among the poor and the lepers. His father was beside himself. If Francesco had lost a fortune in misguided business venture, well, Pietro would have understood it. He unburdened himself to me. He said he considered his son a failure. It was his own fault for spoiling him. He asked my advice. This should be a normal civil suit between a father, who is suing his son for removing property and squandering it and then... Wait, the son didn't ask to be heard in this tribunal, it was the City's consuls who decided the matter came under the ecclesiastic court... The wrong tribunal. As far as I know, my client's son is not a priest or a monk... true, but he has declared himself to be a penitent. A "penitent!" A penitent toward his father, perhaps. No! A "penitent" toward God. A meaningless expression. Here some quite specific things are involved, such as the question of the patrimony of father and son. The son is the owner of goods that the father has already passed to him. And that the son could now squander in the same way Not to mention the rights of inheritance... No! One moment! The "penitent" publicly declares that from this moment on, he will make no further claim against his father's wealth. My boy, reflect. From this moment on you could be stripped of everything. Of every rights in the present and in the future. He says he has thought it over and has decided. Francesco! What have I done to you? What did I do wrong? Yes, I was annoyed by those things you took away, but I have already forgotten that. After all you wanted to give alms. That's only right. You thought that household things were also yours to dispose of. And so you did. Right. That, too, must be done, otherwise what sort of Christians would we be? But now you must be yourself again. Let's go home. Think about your mother... We have disturbed the consuls and the bishop for a family matter and I apologize... my client has embraced a different life. He cannot go home. What life? The life of a beggar? Some gratitude! He cannot do this, my lord bishop! You cannot allow a son to trample on the rights of a father! I've spent a fortune to bring him up like a gentleman. It cost me his weight in gold to free him from prison. I equipped him with armor and horses for a venture that never came off! But I was ready to put my faith in him. Everyone will confirm that! What are you doing Francesco? Francesco! These are yours... I have another father. What are you doing? I was waiting for you. I'm coming with you. Where? - Wherever... I mean it. Go home, go home. We'll meet again. Sir, I wish you peace and well-being for you and yours. Sir, I wish you peace and well-being for you and yours. Get out of here! Get out! It was for the dogs, but if you want it... Thank you. Peace be with you. Go away! That's Tano's place! We don't want outsiders! You're stealing our bread. Go away! Don't touch, this stuff is mine! And you go away! I said no! Soon you'll have a roof over your head. Youre ill, you must cover yourself up and take a rest. Do you realize that? I won't go home till you've started to take care of yourself. She must have made ten miles of bandages. Have you emptied your dowry chest? Come. - What is it? My little brother's dead! I had no more milk... Come away! Come away! I ran away too the first time. And I would have gladly done without my nose. I'll kill myself! I'll kill myself! Let me go! Out! Out! Here comes the bread at last! Be off with you! - No, wait! Hey look, that lunatic Francesco! You started to come in, then you ran off. I saw you! Sit down, eat with us. - I was ashamed... but not anymore. Let's show him a good time! You're kind, just a little something - Ah, it's for you Oh stop it! Take a bath and come to the table! I have an important engagement - Who with? With my mother, my sisters and three children. Stay with us. - Don't go away! Francesco, wait... Where are you going Rufino? Make yourself at home! Thanks... I must go. This is my friend Rufino. My mother can't walk, her legs are sick. My sister has lost a child. Forgive us if we are silent. I was in a panic, like never before, not even during the war, so I run away as fast as I could. I wanted to forget and I couldn't. I kept telling myself, Francesco is crazy. Peace to you... peace to you... peace. Mister, alms! - Mister Hey look who's there! - Francesco? He's Francesco! - How are you? Come here, are you all right? What's wrong? You're not well? - Hey Francesco, don't you recognize us? Are you hungry? - Take a little of this. He's hungry! - Do you want some? Come on eat it! Come on take it! Do you want some more? - Let's give him something to eat! What wrong? Don't you recognize us? - Do you want some more? Do you? That's it, now he will be warmer. But don't you see? It's a delicacy! - Do you like shit? Let's give him some more. - It's good! It's good! Is it true that you like shit? - Come on have some more, eat it! Let's give him alms. You must wrap yourself up, or mummy will scold you! At least he'll wash himself! - And he will refresh his mind. Cling to me! Lord, the rain is beautiful. It washes and relieves our thirst... Lord, our houses are flimsy, and made of mud straw. Lord, help our houses, and speak with the rain. Blessed be the Lord. Who speaks with the rain. I have a list of the goods your father is prepared to give to the poor. That's fine! provided of course, that you go home and lead a normal life, like everybody else. I live a normal life. You don't belong to this people. In the city archives they don't exist! They don't exist? What do you think you can resolve for them? The poor live on nothing, and I can learn from them. I don't understand. - So, what shall I say to your father? Tell him... that he can come and live here I should give away everything I have and become a nobody, like him! The two of us' a fine old age in store for us. He loves you and he respects you. - Respect?! He really does. I thought about it... - Out of here! Shut the door! It's hard to explain. It's as if he'd found... something wonderful and wanted you to share it. Then he really has gone crazy! In the midst of that filth... a wonderful world! My dear notary you've thought about it, but you don't make yourself clear. And what do you have to say, lawyer? I don't know what to say. The notary has told what we saw... I can distinguish order from disorder. I saw there a kind of order. I can't explain it, but I saw it! - You are a man I trust. What do you think of my son? - To say what is happening to your son... I've thought about it too. it's kept me awake. I spied on him... and you were also spying on him. I had to prepare a report... - But I saw you approach a leper and... Because Francesco was there... - No, he wasn't there anymore. I admire your son. But I realize it's possible not to agree with him. And, in fact, I do not agree. I was lying, and Pietro Cattani knew it. I had always been a precise, orderly man, even fastidious. Well, I couldn't sleep, I ate at odd hours, I forgot appointments. I was spying on Francesco, as Pietro Cattani said. And he saw me, because he was doing the same thing. Until... It was a beautiful sunny morning... I'd be very happy! But when it comes to a program... I understand your question, Bernardo. you are a very precise man. But I really don't have one. I don't know anything about it. Thank you. I have these words. If you would be perfect, go sell what you possess and give everything to the poor. Take nothing with you, no purse no money, no sandals. He who would come with me, must renounce himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. That's all I can say. There's nothing to fear. I hardly have any fear now. I hardly have any fear now. Not anymore. Would I have the courage to give away everything for that piece of bread? Out of the way, we are in a hurry! - Be careful! Let's go that way! - That way! Quick! Move! Out of the way! They already took everything. You're not poor! - And you are a fool! Out of the way! Hey! Cousin, this stuff is also mine! Do not touch it! It would be yours if I was dead! - Yes of course as you like... Just pretend I will never die! Aren't you happy - Get out of my way! Out of way! Watch out! - That way! That way! There is the house, lets go! - They already took everything! Let's go! - Give it to me! Give it to me! Move, or theyll take everything! - Out of the way! Stand back! - Excuse me... Excuse me... I was there that day. I knew that Bernardo had three grey-hounds and I wanted to take them. The poor, I said to myself, won't be interested in those hounds. Leone, Lamb of God, where are you going? Can I help you? I was thunder-struck. "Leone, lamb of God!" Why did he call me that? My mother used to say that when I was little, but he couldn't have known. You gave me nothing! - They are giving money too! Don't push! There's plenty for everyone! Don't push! There's plenty of money for everyone. Don't push! Don't push that way! - Wait! Calm down! There's plenty for everybody, calm yourself! Do you realize what you've done? Don't push! Don't push! - There's some more! Finish! Finish! Wait! Wait! You can take it! Suppose they regret this? Not the clothes! - Let's throw him in the water! It hurts, stop! Hold him! Hold him! - Let him go! Some gratitude! - Ingrates! Did you expect them to say "Thank you gentlemen"? Hey! You look like a beggar! - If you could only see yourself! Me? Am I like him? No, he's more handsome! He soaked! And now? And now you're beautiful! I moved from the grieving eyes of my parents, and my horse Omar, to the eyes of Francesco, who became my father and my tender mother. I'm sorry. Angelo, you speak. How did I arrive at the seat of Lord? I've already told you how I met Francesco. I came back to Assisi after my adventures to give him back his armor. It had brought me luck and I wanted to compensate him. Actually, I must confess: I wanted to see that pensive cavalier again. Do you know where I found him? Nino! Nino! Please, don't hang him. He's my brother. Brother? - Brother... Get out! Get out! He's my brother! Hey you' leave him! - My brother! My brother! Let's go away! Nino! Nino! Do you recognize me? What's happened to you? have you become poor? Business gone badly? They're killing him. - That man's a thief! He's our brother. Our brother? Then you're in a bad way. "Fraternitas... I kept repeating fraternity to myself until I got the word into my head. That was what I wanted, to my enormous amazement. Write that, Leone, it's beautiful. I grew up with Francesco. Everything happened before my eyes. But I was hesitant, a fearful man. Fearful since my childhood. Nightmares. Then I was afraid that I would lose my inheritance. Because my father became involved in business ventures. The first rain, it'll fall down. - Eh, so it goes. Wouldn't it be better to use stone and mortar? If you need, I can... Don't worry. It's like those. I've brought you something to eat. Oh good idea! Leone, please, you fix the meal. Somebody else can kill it. Not me! Oh! What a fuss! I don't know where to strike. I was a notary, not a butcher! You do it. You've had more experience. And roast it with horse mint! You're no better than women. Come here, you. He looks like Leone! If a lamb stayed alive, among those hungry men, then, I said to myself, that is truly the house of the Lord. I didn't go home again, and I no longer felt any fear. Fear, no! But plenty of hunger. Write that, Leone! I'm dying. I can't keep it up. Bad dreams? - No, hunger. Don't be embarrassed. Eat in peace. Where does this gift of God come from? - It's like a rock. A peasant had given it to his rabbits. - And the poor rabbits? They were very happy to share. I asked them, and they said: "yes, yes, yes... " Mamma! Mamma! This big one is my wife, and the little one is my son. I've been tempted, forgive me. We must separate for a while. You two go North, and you two South. You and you here, to Assisi. No, please. Send me somewhere else. I'd be ashamed here. Ashamed? Then you should go right into the cathedral. It's Sunday and it's full, and you can preach a sermon. I don't know how to speak! And besides, everybody knows me! Then go naked. - Naked? No one's ever seen you before. You should wash your face. - No! Ite missa est. Hey! Look, it's Rufino, look! - Rufino! Peace is everything. Those who are at peace with God are already in Paradise. I swear it's true, I give my word. No! no! - Let's go away. Don't act like that! Brother, forgive me, I was carried away. Speak to them, try again. They will listen. I am a son of God. We don't want you! But I didn't know that before, so are all of us, I give you my word. I give you my word of honor. Peace is everything. - Peace is everything. It is easy to worship wooden images. They never suffer hunger or cold. Would you drive away a man who wants to become a saint? Would you? Drive away a man who want to become a saint? Would you? It takes courage. And others have this courage. I'm speaking of those who live outside the city, the poor. Who live outside of the wall of the city they have this courage. Will you help us? will you pray with us? Blessed Irene paralyzed and peaceful. Blessed Irene paralyzed and peaceful. Blessed Irene paralyzed and peaceful. Blessed Matteo, orphan full of hope. Blessed Eugenia, leper who does not curse Blessed Bonizio, blind man, who sees sun and stars. Blessed little Luca, in heaven. Blessed his mother, without milk, but with faith! Blessed are the stupid fools like you! Let's throw them out! We took a beating. But afterwards many young men joined us. The period of persecution was beginning. You can fill a lot of pages with that. It was also my fault. I will write that it was also your "merit" You can still come here, as you used to do from time to time. All or nothing. Like him. Like you. I couldn't bear it if you were humiliated or hurt. Mater Carissima, love has a price. I'm afraid. The only fear I have left It's for you. Are you afraid I may be hungry and cold that I might be raped or killed? Let me offer up the safety I have enjoyed. Tell her no. My cousin cannot live here with the life she's used to. She can't stay here or go along the roads at the mercy of violent criminals. Have you finished? - No. Chiara says she love Christ, may be she loves you and she doesn't know. Go on! You say you love only her soul, but Chiara is also beautiful! Chiara is beautiful, But don't tempt me with your fears. - You trust yourself to much. I trust her. They'll insult us more than ever. They'll imagine who knows what. What? You know very well what people imagine when they see a girl with some men. Chiara wants to become a brother. Fantastic! I'm serious. I have seen a lot of women around the world, gypsies, adventurers... Nobody is going to recognize her if she dresses like us. Women are even between lepers, poor... - Christ trusted them. He was the Christ, but what about us? We are only men. Why limit the grace of God? - That's right! You're all a bore! I'm with you even when my body is here. I have found that life is beautiful only because your life is beautiful. Fathers, mothers... Brothers, receive me. Father, mother, sister, brother, pray for us Father, mother, sister, brother, pray for us Are you sure? Don't worry. I know, I know "he who lose gain", but... Chiara, poorest of the poor. Chiara, pilgrim of the world. Chiara, mystery of God. Chiara, pray for us. Chiara poorest of the poor. Show your face! Hey you belong to the Offreduccio family! Yes you do. They are looking for you, you know? Let's take her home! - What if she isn't? Let's take her somewhere else. She has a little pretty face. What is wrong? - My cousin. She's alone on the road. I'm worried. I sent her out. What happened? - Nothing. Stand back Bernardo! Ah! There you are! Hey listen to me. Where is my niece? I want my niece! Idiot! Where is my niece? Tell me! Where is she? Where did you hide her? Idiot! Take me to her. They're hunting Chiara! - Where is she? At the lazaret. - Bring her to San Damiano. Most lofty and all powerful Lord. You are strong, you're great, you are true... You are our guardian, our protector and defender. You are safety, you are peace. You are beauty, you are meekness Uncle, leave them alone, here I'm. Come home! The farce is over. - I'm already home. I have made a vow! To whom? To these fools here? I have made a vow to God and you are in his palace. Come on! - Stop! Why is he coming out? - Push! He must right where he is! Good... keep on pushing very good... push! Push! He must stay inside! Saint Lady, Saint mother of God Lady full of grace Saint your home Saint mother of God. Lady full of grace Saint mother of God. Lady full of grace Saint you home. Saint mother of God. Lady full of grace Use this. Thank you. If we only had some wool. He is beautiful! - Another unfortunate. He's the King of the Kings - Stop talking rubbish! They've came to tell me that you're a disturber of the peace, provoking scandals. And now, women! People have come to me to protest! They expect you to set up a convent, a house, a charitable institution. There are offers, building, lands... I can't accept. You're not alone! The women, they are exposed to all kind of dangers. What are you going to do my boy... You cannot go around like stray animals, with no roof over your heads, half naked, so vulnerable, you must realize that Francesco! I cannot defend you. Cause only the Pope has the power to do that. Listen, it's necessary that you see him. With his permission, they'll leave you in peace. You must come to a decision. Only he is able to resolve your problems. Can you borrow me the needle? - No... I'll do it for you. It's an excuse for not washing yourself. - Let me finish my job. Do you want to go to the Pope with tears? Patches are all right, tears are not. Stop it! He will never grant audience to us. - Why not? Innocenzo llI used to study in Bologna with me. He is a clever man, very sensitive... So you are the who'll talk to him. I'll do what you want, but in my opinion you should do that. Cut it out! - Come on you need a bath! But, there must be a mistake. Paupers are received on the floor below. But... - Cardinal of St. Paul's orders. Follow me. Full power is here. Tell the bishop of Rennes that we alone are the vicar of him whose eyes see justice. We alone have the proper remedies against evil. I feel a weight here. - It's all the lemons you eat and drink. The only thing I can digest. Now I'm as bitter and yellow as they are. You bring the alms seekers up here? The Cardinal of St. Paul's, my lord. He's the one who ordered it. Come on, come on. What do you accuse us of? Everybody accuse Rome of something. They are not accusing anyone. They speak no words of hate. They love everyone, including us. They want to live following the Gospel and ask their rules to be confirmed. This is the life of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that the penitents of Assisi The penitents must live in poverty, love and chastity, following the teaching of Jesus Christ, who said: go, sell what you have, and give all to the poor etcetera. Renounce yourself. - Yes we know the Gospel, thank you. These groups always begin following the Gospel in humility and poverty, then vanity takes over! Yes. and before long they proclaim themselves the true Christians, the only Apostles, and cover the throne of Peter with insults. I will guarantee against that. They have the recommendation of their bishop, a man of proven faith. And I myself have observed them for more than a month. How can you guarantee the impossible? What man can strip himself of everything to live like a lamb at the mercy of the wolves, who are so many and so fierce? Should we declare that it is impossible to live the life of the Gospel? We certainly cannot declare that! And we should not. Who is the leader? Speak! Speak. The pope is listening. I don't know... I'm confused. Do you believe it's important to dress like beggars? It's... a first step... dress as a new man. Good, a fine quotation, St Paul, epistle to Ephesians. You were rich, now you are poor, how will you survive in a world spoiled by sin? The footprints. - The footprints of Christ. They're covered with dust! Trampled by the prints of impostors. "We" are not poor. How can you love us? Without limitation without judgment. We will never try to restrain any possible grace. We shall see if you are truly "new men" then you will come back. In nomine patris, et filii, et spiritus sancti. Well? Tell me. - He gave us his blessing. We did it! Francesco! Francesco! Calm! be gentle! He can't breathe. You're crushing him! - Stand back! Stop! - Gently! Gently! Let's lift him up! - Don't hurt him! No, don't do that! Stand back! Stand back. Please! If the Pope or the cardinal had seen us they wouldn't have taken us seriously. Did anybody take us seriously? Plenty took us seriously. Too many perhaps. The reason was... - He was the reason. You always loved him. Yes, I did. I always will. That goes for me too. - "Amor... Ardor". What? For me he was an earthquake. it changed everything. Before I was a dumb ox, and I didn't know it. And afterwards you knew it? Yes, I owe him a beautiful life. "Novae gratiae... verbum" "Novae gratiae verbum" The word of new grace spread so widely, that young men of every country wanted to become our brothers. We became so numerous that it was decided we would all gather at least one a year for Pentecost, here in Assisi. "Ave Maria, gratia plena, dominus tecum, benedicitas tu in mulieribus... et benedictus fructus ventris tui. " "ll fault le suivre" (let's follow him) Look! How will I ever meet everyone? - That one is Francesco! How can we feed them all? Tomorrow belong to the Lord. - No... Francesco! - No! Get up! Where are you from? Come from Freiburg. Pedibus, on foot. Peace to you. And you? - Venice. Bologna! - Paris! Pedibus? - How can I be like you? You must announce peace. First you must find peace in your heart and in yourself. You say: "Take nothing with you. " Do you mean stark naked? As naked as a hand. What's falling? - What's going on? Be careful! - What's that? Francesco! What are you doing? - This is our house! My brothers have no house! - our baggage is in there! And some provisions. It's Francesco, he's destroying the house. A holy man with his own ideas! With his poor eyesight, he could fall. Francesco, Francesco, please! This house belongs to the city, which offered it to us. We cannot accept it! - But it's no right! There are more delicate brother, noblemen, scholars... Would you have them all sleep under the trees? Yes! Under the trees with the squirrels. You should come down! The Pope's envoy has arrived. Nobody obligates us, we are the brother without anything. We do not judge those who are above us. All I say is that we have chosen to be lower, with nothing, and therefore those without fear, free! What do you mean "those who have nothing?" We've come here to come to conclusion. We would like a program, a rule. I believe I am expressing the general opinion of those who protest. The rule exists, it's the Gospel. Brother the program is there waiting for you. What are you meaning "is there waiting for us"? Don't be absurd! - The Gospel is a serious matter! We want a program! - Yes, a program! With a rule! - A program, we want a program! Silence! - Let him speak! Brother, you take the Gospel literally like a simpleton. Yes, literally, like a simpleton. Brother, you're an intelligent man, aren't you? At the university I studied "grammaticam divinitatem et legem" By any chance, did you have a fellow student by the name of Jesus of Nazareth? What do you mean? You are the one who studied. Learned brothers, you know how to speak. I am so low. That I mingle with the dirt. I know nothing. I've been only able to listen. To listen, listen. And finally I have succeeded in hearing these words. "Blessed are the poor" and blessed are those who weep. For they shall laugh. And blessed are those who have something to laugh about! This is a farce! Be quiet! - Brothers! Let Francesco speak! Sometimes I laugh instead of crying. I have heard also this: Woe to you when everyone speak well of you! Bless those who insult you, and love your enemies. Really love them, embrace them. There is no great merit in loving those who already love you. Do not judge. Who are we to judge anyone? Besides our Father's mercy is beyond knowing. Forgive, ten times, even a thousand times. And most of all, give, give, always give! Give what? We have nothing to give. - That's right! He won't allow us to have anything. - Be quiet! He hasn't finished! Father, I am blind. Can a blind man lead other blind men? We can't do anything, Francesco keeps on telling us, don't judge. Don't take offices. No buildings and so on. Francesco has the uprightness of a hero. - Of a saint, let's face it! But not everyone can be like him. Without a serious rule, all the people who want to join us will become a group of wanderers, instead of an army that serves the church. Our community is getting so wide that it can't be controlled just by his inspiration. Francesco accepts anybody. If someone wants to leave he can do that in fact a lot of people come and go. We don't have any disciplinary rule. He lives from hand to mouth. He has no theological qualification, he can't control a religious order. But his ardour and his obedience to the Church make of him a very precious man. Sure, but our movement has reached a turning point. At the beginning it was just ten of them but today we are thousand we have brothers all over Italy. Most of the time they are refused by the local authority because they don't have any document to prove they are reliable. But in this way we are free. Documents tie people. They are mistaken for beggars and mistreated. We need to be organized, we need a hierarchy. We need headquarters and branches, This indescribable place is not enough! I've studied hard, now I can't stand that everything is summed up in "Blessed are the poor and the ordinary" he want us to serve paupers and lepers It's dangerous to carry things too far. Francesco's popularity is huge. I'm amazed. Here we are just a few, there are a lot of young men who want to join us. We need to take control of the situation as soon as possible. Heretics of every sort make the Church a plaything of the godless. We are forced to fight hateful wars to defend ourselves. With loving envy we look at those like you who can stand to one side and live the Gospel wholeheartedly. Don't you think the practice of the Gospel should be more accessible? You cannot ask the impossible of a human being. Confine your dream. It's less beautiful I understand that, it's also sad. But necessary. You must be reasonable. Won't you speak? Francesco! Francesco! Francesco! Francesco! Francesco! Francesco! - Francesco! We were waiting for you. Speak! It's my turn to remain silent. You should speak. No, my son, speak. Nothing will be done against your will. If I should speak... Then I should say... go through this world... empty handed... as this child. Forget me, I am as if dead. from now on. Our new leader will be Pietro Cattani. We will obey him. Francesco! Francesco! Stop! Leave him alone! Please leave him alone! Francesco... You've come back? I knew it. I kept saying to your mother, He'll come back, I won't change my will. No, because he'll come back. A son is a son. Forgive me. The coffer! It's all written here. The new plans, too. You understand better than anyone else. My son on the Crusade! Did you really go? Is it true you spoke with the Saladin? That he would speak only with you? They say you're famous. You've won! You're a knight, aren't you? I knew it... I knew it... I knew it. He's still cold. Where are you going? - To look for some blankets. Where? - I don't know, I don't know what to do. The same quartan fever? Yes, but it's worse than ever. He needs a doctor! - He refuses! In the Gospel there is a strong, meek man, vigorous and tender, a man who knows how to cry and knows how to laugh, a man who can be excited or desperate. A man who faces the cross with his heart, a man like you, in other words. A man who doesn't draw back. We are alone. You can raise your cloak. Alone? Francesco! Francesco? Francesco! Let us learn from the stones! - Learn what? Silence. Write, the one who doesn't work won't eat either Leone... - slow down a bit please. Today you've gone to town and begged alms for two lazybones! Write Leone... being poor is a warrant for freedom Wait I've got just two hands! I'll write it later. be always kind to everybody, write this as well. And be like a mother each other Wait! You're trembling like a leaf. - NO, no... Yes, and since I'm your mother I must insist. Stop! Leave him in peace! We are writing the rule! Precisely, that's why we are here. Francesco, are you all right? What do you want? They're afraid you'll write too stern a rule, something inhuman. They want you to know that, if so, you write it just for you, not for them. "They want you to know that, if so, you write it only for you, not for them". They? And you? Lord I said that they would not heed you. The lord has said that the Rule is his! He says to follow it to the letter! To the letter! Those of you who do not wish to, should leave. No one is obliged to! Do you understand? Do you understand? We must persuade him. He must come down with us. He can't stay up here. Francesco is ill. - His stomach, his eyes. It's cold here, impossible. Come down to the valley, I'll find you a house. He would be worse. We are not learned man, are we? - No. They want us to write out a Rule. - You dictate and I'll write. We know the Gospel, and we like it. What do you think we should do. Write what we know and like. Jesus says... "Come follow me". And what does the man who's called to? He gives up everything and follows. Shall I write that? Shall I? This rule is a suicide. The same all words. He's as stubborn as a mule! We should go around like vagabonds, dreadfully poor, with no protection. The cardinal is waiting for a document to present to the Pope. We can't show him this text! We're back where we started. He must rewrite it! He'd write the same thing. I don't think he could rewrite it. He's not able, he's ill. In that case, appropriate brother must do it, us in other words. But what about it? One can't ignore it. This one will be lost. - No! What are you doing? No! No! Little lamb of God, we have to start again! What's going on? Where are we? Do you have a good memory? - Why? We have to rewrite the Rule. - No! This time we'll bring it to the Pope ourselves. He's in Perugia now. When did he die? Yesterday. They're already running off to the election. Up, go up! Take it up! Come! What did you tell him? To open his eyes. - But he's dead! To open them elsewhere, in peace. Leone, the Rule! We came here to give it to him. But... he's dead! Do you think because he's dead he cannot read? Go on give it to him. Lord... Lord, answer me. Lord... Lord... Lord... Lord, answer me, answer me. I, Leone, lamb of God, would have been very strict before accepting so many brothers. Especially those, who were the most glib talkers. Just come out and say it, what with all the criticism and objections, they bewildered and humiliated and depressed him. You must also write that we saw him in despair. He had the impression that he had done everything wrong, and that he was really insane, just "God's madman". Yes, Leone, write it down. It was his darkest moment. Francesco! Francesco! Leone! Leone! Francesco! Francesco! Leone! Leone don't leave me! I'm here. Leone. Leone. - Yes. I have not studied Grammaticam, divinitatem, et legem. All the same, "Deux mihi dixit"... "Deux mihi dixit". God spoke. Do you understand? Yes... it's true. Leone, what if I'm a fool? No! You responded without reservation, yes, without reservation. But he was suffering. - You were suffering too. But I have seen many suffer much more. For us it was easy. Wasn't it, Leone? Not always... - I see so many... so many faces, and what have I been able to do to help them? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I desire to be alone. But if it's necessary to you to come, come. Speak to me... Speak to me... Speak to me... Speak to me... Speak to me... Francesco! What's happened? Let me see. Let me see. You've hurt yourself. He answered! "Deux mihi dixit... " God spoke to me again! "Deux mihi dixit... " God spoke to me again! That's exactly what happened. After so many days finally he smiled and embraced me. You saw nothing? - Saw? Silence. For some moments there was a total silence. And he didn't talk to you about it? - No, it remained a secret. Except for Chiara. - What did he say? What did you think? He said nothing. I tended the wounds, without asking any questions. I thought that love had made his body identical to the Beloved's. And I asked myself if I would ever be capable of loving that much.
