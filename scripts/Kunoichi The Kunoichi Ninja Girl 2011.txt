Come on, we've been walking for ages. Hey, you all want to rest too, right? Come on, speak up! You all want to rest too, right? No one wants to rest. Your back and legs must be tired from all this walking. Yes, we're tired, aren't we? You agree, right? Where are you taking us? Let's decide when to rest, depending on where we're headed. What's the word? Are you a ninja? That doesn't matter at this point. Because I was kidnapped by a second-class ninja like you. You've got a point. So, where are you taking us? Tell us. Finally, you're going to rest? Inshun. Hey, wait a minute. You're doing a head count with this small group? You already counted in the morning. How can we escape while being tied like this? There's no need to count. What's the problem? No use debating with him. He only does as he pleases. Next time you hit me, you're gonna get it! Are you threatening me? You can't do anything, tied like this. Hey, hey, you hear me? It hurts! I said it hurts! Stop with this, will you? I can't stand pain. You see, pain is hard to stand, right? Huh...you've got a good kick. Did it hurt? You like pain, right? Hey, hey, I said I hate pain. Hey, there's a better way to stop the sword than this. Let go. I said, let go. Whatever. Answer when your name is called. Inshun. Yes. Yayoi. Yes. Hanatsuki. That's me. Kisaragi. Hey, how much are you getting paid to do this? We're not getting paid. Working for free? We're not doing this for money. What for, then? This is a part of ninja's work. What kind of work is this? We have a curious bunch here. I'll tell you if you open your legs wide. You take off your clothes first. I'm too shy, so I'll follow after you do it. Don't be shy. In the name of ninja's work, you've done it with many guys. Hurry and take off your clothes. When I run out of bogeys to pick and get bored as hell, I'll let you do it. But before that, you tell us why you're doing this. To make you all tools of pleasure. How is this possible? Hey. I have a proposal to make. Hey! You shouldn't waste your time like this. Yo! You hate me that much? The least you can do is hear me out. Why are you in such a hurry? Don't be so scared, I'm not going to bite. I might lick though. What are you going to do with me? You know the answer to that. Yes, that's it. That's the answer. You kidnapped us all the way from Kouga, just to make us your tools of pleasure? Huh? Is something wrong with that? Were you about to wet your pants? I don't want to get dirty with piss. Don't worry, killing you is not our goal. Our goal is to take you all to the village. Just so you will never escape again. This is a job our family has done for generations. For generations? I think it's time to go home. Yes, let's call it a day. We don't fight with our enemies. We hide in the enemy's village, and kidnap women. Or we kidnap the women that belong to the enemy village that our ninja group defeated. Why do you do this? In our village, men of low rank are not allowed to sleep with women. They can sleep with men though. But male ninjas tend to want women. And the village would not exist without children. No women in your village? Women are only for high-ranked people. Not enough to get around to the low-ranked. That's the way it is. Women are rewards. Only men who've worked hard get them. The best living reward. Even a useless woman like you will get nice treatment if you come to our village. So, are you coming to our village? How about it? Say something! I'm asking you! This is a very important job. We've done this for generations. My great-grandfather, grandfather and father. Without this, our village would not exist. That's why we are taking all of you there. Everyone in the village is waiting for all of you. Come on, are you coming or not? You don't want to, of course. Come on, hear me out. Don't run away. I'm "Kouga", not "lga". Kouga? Yeah, I'm Kouga, same as you. You'll save me, then? First, just come over here. If you don't come with me, do you know... ..what'll happen to you? Before the sky turns red though it's not sunset. And before the leaves turn red though it's not autumn. You should come with me. It's better. So don't ever think of running away. I have to deliver you safely to the village. That's your problem, I don't care. Never heard of a freaky job like that. You think I'll happily become your tool of pleasure? Huh! A normal man would be in great pain if he was kicked in the crotch. But we're different. I told you we've been doing this for generations. Our genitals have been cut off. So we won't lay a hand on the women. To be precise, we've lost our manhood. Don't want to be kidnapped by a sissy like me? I don't even like myself. I'm adopted, don't know my real parents. On top of that, my balls were cut off at birth. It was painful. Have you ever had it cut off? No way! I knew that. Even I don't remember, since it was right at birth. If you can't do it with a woman, then what do you want? I'm not like the other members that don't touch women. I want to do it with women, just like a regular guy. But I can't with this body. So instead... Show me. What? Not you. What is that? An illness maybe? What kind of illness? And why are you showing me such a sick man? Don't get so excited. I'll explain everything. I don't lay a finger on women, but it doesn't mean I'm their slave. Please...don't. All I need to do is take you to the village alive. I understand, I'll do as you say. So please don't hit me any more. Let's straighten you out before we get to the village. So you won't try to escape from the village. I'll teach you a lesson so you will be obedient. That's what kindness is. Do you know what this is? When you arrive at the village, you'll get your teeth pulled out. To prevent you from biting. It is troublesome when women bite off the man's thing. The ninja will lose his agility if his thing is bitten off. That's why all teeth are pulled out in the beginning. I'll go ahead and do it now. It's not my job to do it. But I love that sound... the tweaking sound of teeth. Let's give it a go. Lately, there's been too much kidnapping of women. I was checking to see who was behind all of this. Turned out to be lga's doings. So I reported this to our lord. He ordered me to plant it in the kidnapped women. Plant it? Plant the disease in you, and send you into the lga village. What? You're not here to save me? You're not listening to me. You will become a tool of pleasure for the men of lga. He has a sexual disease. If you go to lga with this disease, then the disease will be transmitted to everyone. I'm not fond of bullying women. But women listen once they get hit with this. That's a fact. Please don't hit me with that. You understand, this is my job. No, I don't understand! Don't move. If you move, then the hit will kill you. Sorry about that. I needed to hear what the scumbag had to say. Yo, couldn't you wait a little more? It was just about to get good... Yo, that was sudden. No matter how many times you hit me, I'll get up again. You must be tired of kicking by now. Please stop... I'm totally OK. You're in too much pain, you must be numb. Yes, it seems that... No, it hurts! You can kill him as a sign of revenge. Revenge? Um... Um... Excuse me. What are you doing? It's better to kill as many lga ninjas as possible... than to be taken to lga and live like a slave. Become sick for the Kouga people and transmit it to the lgas. No, help me! What's going on? You're having sex with him, what else? Please! Don't! It's a sexually transmitted disease. You have to have sex. Please stop! The disease has gone to his head, so he doesn't feel any pain. Please...don't... All right. What? Goodbye. Don't move! What? I'm right here! You finally appeared. You knew I was here. I knew you would get here on your own. If not, then I would have knocked her out, and gone after you. Did you kill Hyogi? Of course. He loves giving and receiving pain. So he must have enjoyed the process. Set all the women free. And disappear. Get back in line. If you do that, then I'll take you to the village without deforming your face. This is meaningless. I beat women but I don't kill, that's my style. But I've got to do my job. I have no choice. I love beating men. Especially a hooligan like you. That's going too far. If he's dead, can't get any information from him. Who are you? Good thing you weren't shredded to pieces. But this will hurt a bit. Let's keep her, might come in handy. She might be useful too. You're pretty good. Where do you hide your sword? I have no time to play now. Where did that come from? You're not the only one who can do tricks like this. Don't think you can kill me with a small knife. You haven't killed him, have you? What a horrible sight. You've taken this too far. Shouldn't have lent you my knife. I just used my skill. If I didn't, I'd be dead. He was cruel to women, so it was punishment? I heard your mother was kidnapped also? Are you going to use her? She wouldn't be here if I wasn't. You have an objection to that? Either you find out where the village is and wipe out those human-trafficking pimps, or I make them screw these sick women. The lord ordered the latter. From the looks of him, it's impossible to take the women to the village. You hurt him on purpose, didn't you? You can tell the lord whatever you like. As long as you take on the responsibility, I don't care. So, what are you gonna do? How can you come up with such a horrible idea? He said he was without his manhood. He probably screws around with men. Men can transmit the disease. Why did you have to use your own kind? What'll it be? I'll follow him, and find out where the village is. I'm going back home. Two women are alive, take them back with you. No way. One of them is sick. Two is too much anyway. That's not my job. Take them back. If you don't, I'm telling our lord you abandoned other village members. Fine, I'll take them back. Please take care of them. Such a drag. You... Why...? Doing it with a woman is fine, but with a man is unbelievable. What if I really get the disease? You didn't have the disease after all. It seemed you weren't into doing it with a man. He's a man so he wasn't paying much attention. But I'm a woman. I watched very closely. If you're going to backstab, you have to be thorough. You kidnapped the women and provided to those pimps? And gave the list of names to that overly organised Shimotsuki. He wouldn't know the names otherwise. I was ordered to find out where the enemy village is. And also find out who the traitor is. The end comes suddenly. You. Take the woman in the shrine, and go back to the village. I have a mission to find out where the enemy village is, and kill them all. So you take care.
