You were taken from your mom by CPS, Child Protective Services. They did it to keep you safe, America. You were placed with a foster family? They were rich and my skin was too dark, so they gave me to their housekeeper. - Mrs. Harper? - Yeah, Miss Harper. And she tried to adopt you? You think about her a lot? Yeah, I think about her.

It's higher than any place in the whole world. - Sounds beautiful. - It is. You don't know where the clouds start and the snow stops. Yeah, but you have to worry about that frostbite. Turn your skin all black, start to fall off. Next thing you know, your whole nose is gone just like that! Want it? - Give me a fresh piece. - Come on. Don't be a baby. You have a sexy mouth. - Give it back. - No, you're not getting it back. Give it! What's this? - It's cut and stitch. - What? I used to cut myself and then stitch it with a needle and thread. Wait a minute. Weren't you the one crying, begging me to never hurt myself? I told you. I don't do it anymore. - Goes up your whole arm. - My legs too, my belly. I liked to feel the pain on the outside, not the inside. That's what Dr. B says. When you cut open your skin, you see life running out. I've done worse. What? I've done something so bad that I can never tell anybody. I'm not anybody. It's me. Come on, tell me. - I can't... I can't tell you. - Tell me. Tell me!

Liza, wait. Come... What do you want? - Where'd you get that? - Why, you want some? I thought you were getting clean. What happened? What happened to you, Lyle, Mom? You got me out here in the middle of the night to ask me what happened? You know. You were there. We got separated. It's over. Done. Forget it. Now let's get this straight. You and me, we ain't brothers, we ain't associates, we ain't nothing. You got that? Why'd you show up then, if we ain't nothing? Can you tell me about your brothers? After the cops came I never saw them again. - Separated, different foster home? - Yeah, in and out for 3 stupid years. - Must have been horrible. - I kept telling them the numbers. - Mrs. Harper's phone number? - Yeah, Mrs. Harper. You got lost in the system, but you're back You a man now! We've been looking for you. You know what they said? "You got lost in the system. " - But you're back! You're back! Reggie! - Yeah. - Here he is. He's back. - Yeah, there he is. Look at you, boy. Oh, no! You a man now! You got to go back to her, right? - You got to go back to Mrs. Harper's? - Yeah. And then, when you were 16, you ran away. I don't really understand that part, America. All you wanted was to get back there, and then after you were there, you left. Can you tell me why? Would you like to see her, America? - She's probably dead now anyway. - No, she's not dead. She's in a nursing home not far from here, and if you like, we could go see her. - Yeah. Okay. - Okay. America What happened just then? We were talking about Mrs. Harper, and you checked out. You went someplace. - Where did you go? - I didn't go anywhere, okay? I'm here. I'm right here! We all go away in our minds sometimes. Everyone does it. It's totally normal. Really, I mean, things are too painful to talk about, you don't want to think about it, you get a little brain break, you know? A little vacation in your mind. Everything shuts off. You go someplace safe. Okay, I'm screwed up, all right? - I knew that already. - You are not screwed up. You're human! That's how we protect ourselves. - I'm out of here. - Hey, come on! Have I ever walked out on you? Even once? Have I? No. You gotta stop walking out on me, all right? We're past that. When you go away in your head, tell me, where do you go? Mount Everest. - Mount Everest? - Yeah. It's cold, so cold you go numb all over. And you don't feel anything there? It's peaceful, quiet, and now that I told you, I don't think I can go there anymore. Maybe you won't have to. What's that word? "This side up". You're guessing. Don't guess. Sound it out. You think I'm dumb, and you don't like me anymore! Well, I've always liked you. Before, now, forever! America! - That's a bunch of crap! - Hey, come on. Come on, America. You getting all riled up. Help me with supper. We gotta take care of her. We a team, you and me! Tuck your fingers under, like I showed you. Professional, all right? So you don't cut yourself. Here you go. You need to relax. You're too tense. Here, try this. Come on, it'll relax you. What are you? A little girl? Come on, man! Look here. Now try. - That's better. Yeah. - That better? Yeah. Good. You be cool, and I'll teach you how to spell. I'll help you with your spelling. - Are you ready? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Let's go! - All right. What's that? - "P." - Right. And this one here? - "E." - Now here's a real difficult one. - "N." - And the easiest one of all. - "I." - And the snake! The snake. - "S." Now put it all together. - "Penis. " - What? "Penis. " - Say it! - "Penis!" Crazy! Here, have some more. I don't think she'd like this. She not going to know. It's gonna be our little secret. Now, go ahead, finish it up. And now you going to drink or you going to cut the celery? - You look very nice. - I ironed my shirt in the laundry room. - Who taught you to iron? - Reggie. Yeah? Good guy, huh? There's nothing wrong with Reggie. - Are you ready? - Yeah. - You're sure? - Yeah. All right. Then go right through here. She used to talk about you. Her boy, America. She doesn't talk much anymore, but I know she hears. Mrs. Harper? Mrs. Harper? Guess who's here to see you? America. Well, you've been waiting on him. Here he is. Hello, Miss Harper. It's been a long time. Do you remember when we used to play hide and seek? - Do you remember that? - I remember. And all the angels you used to paint? Angels. I'm sorry for what I did. I never... I never meant to hurt you. I... Your ring. Your magic ring. You like that ring? You like that ring? You like that ring? Now if you have good luck, you gonna give me some?

I'll see what I can do. - Brooklyn. - What the heck are you doing here? Working. I got a job here. I've had experience working in the kitchen. Look, I'm not trying to bother you, but since we're both here, there's a lot of stuff we could talk about. - I don't think so. - Why not? I told you before, I don't remember nothing. Nothing at all. Look, it wasn't right, okay? They should've kept us all together. We're brothers. Get back to the pots and pans, man. - I been looking for you... - Enough! Give it up. Just give it up.

But you don't have to cut yourself to let all the pain out. - What else can you do? - You talk to someone, someone you trust, and that's why I'm here. - I'm sorry. - Wait, don't. - No. I'm sorry. - No. No. - I'm not gonna touch you again. - Don't... - Don't touch me. - I'm sorry about that. What's going on? Can you... Can you tell me? - No, I can't. - Just tell me, America. Just say it! - Everybody leaves, okay? - Everybody like who? Like Liza? My mother, Liza, my brothers. - They all... They all go away. - No one ever stays. Okay. People who are supposed to protect me, don't. People who are supposed to care, don't. Reggie, Mrs. Harper, my brothers, my mother, everyone. So confused you don't know what's right, what's wrong anymore. This is gonna be our special secret This is gonna be our special secret This is gonna be our special secret. I'm just teaching you to be a man. And you know what? You're a good learner. You're a good learner You're a good learner Yes, you did! I didn't do nothing wrong! I keep telling you, I didn't do nothing! Then why do they keep calling me, wanting to have a conference? Your grades are going down. They telling me you're disturbed! No, something ain't right. Imagine having your fingers scraped like I'm scraping this carrot. Take the skin of your finger and peel it right off, just like that. Imagine that as a way to think about what might happen if you tell our secret. What about Mrs. Harper? What... What was that about Mrs. Harper? Nothing. The boy's just giving me trouble, that's all. I don't like carrots, is all. Since when? Since when you don't like carrots? - What's going on here? - Nothing. Everything's fine. Look, don't worry about America. I talked to the principal and the teachers, and they're working it out. And he's gonna straighten up, right? - Something's always with this boy. - Yeah, always! Yeah, he's just a little behind, that's all. Just a little dumb. - I ain't dumb! - Yes, you are! You're dumb! - I'm not dumb! - No, you're not dumb. He kept... He kept saying... He kept saying I would like it! And in the beginning I did, but then it stopped feeling good! You're talking about Reggie? Is that the way you going to be? Well, maybe I go find your precious Mrs. Harper, go find that old lady, huh? Is that what you want? Is that what you want? He said he was gonna hurt her. - He was gonna hurt Mrs. Harper? - Yes. I... - I... I can't. I... - Yes, you can. You're so close, America, you're so close. What did he do? Tell me, what did Reggie do? He took care of me, okay? He bought me stuff. He was nice. Now you know all the things I do for you. Just remember that, huh? Just remember. Put that in your head, and then you don't have to worry about that old lady. She's just getting in the way. She's just getting in the way I had to do it! He said he was going to kill her, okay? I had to do something! I... - I just couldn't take it anymore. - What did you do? I knew where they kept some money. I was gonna pay her back, I swear. I would... I would never hurt her. I know you wouldn't hurt her, America. Look at me. Look at me. Tell me what happened. I wet some towels. I put them under her door. I put them I put them by her door and I was drunk and I killed him! I killed him! - I killed him! I killed him! - Okay. - I had to do it. - Okay. Okay, okay, okay. I saw it on TV. They were pulling his body out of the house on a stretcher. Mrs. Harper told them he was smoking in bed. She covered for me. She loved you. I didn't hate Reggie. He was... He was kind. He wasn't. - What? - Are you going to tell? No, America. I'm not going to tell. Okay. - Are you ready? - Yeah. You wrote down everything in there that you need to say to Reggie? - Everything? - Yeah. Okay. Now we bury it. Now it's done. I'm proud of you. You take as long as you need. I'll meet you inside, all right? You try to bury the hurt and hope the future will be better Kids go away, released into the world at 18 I never know where they may land Most aren't ready They go back to a family that's unable or unwilling to care for them, or they end up in the streets It often feels hopeless But at the end of the day, I live for that moment when I see one kid heading down the right path Foster, it means to support, to encourage, to sustain, to cherish Its very first meaning was to feed or nourish That seems pretty simple All a kid needs is one person to hang on to, one person to see them, to listen, to care, to show up consistently One person, that's what I believe Another batch, and I always get a catch in my throat Maybe I'm naive, but I think in a country like ours, we can do better, we must These kids don't belong to somebody else These kids belong to all of us They are America's children They are America
