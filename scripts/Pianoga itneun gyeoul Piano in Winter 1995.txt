Do you know each other? Ill buy tickets. Don't misunderstand me! The accident... I've told you that... Ifve never seen such that girl in my life. She's my younger sister. Drink it. You look awful. What's matter with you. It annoys me. Am l? Sorry, then. Jinwoo! Have you ever kissed her? Then, have you ever slept with her? l thought you're dating with her for long time. Hyejin! l know you're very known to acting as nobility. It does not matter who's been dating with whom! But, it is true that lover could be altered. Jiae! You are such inconvenient person! Do you know that? Hyejin! Do it and say it! Why do l break into your love affair! Ignore me and mad at me! No, l don't want to be mad at you! What are you made by? You always act as if you are very warm and kind. Disgusting. You're probably, right. But l just want you to know that Im always concerning about you. l don't need that. Hyejin! Don't you understand me! l know who you are. Even you're act as like an angel. You always laugh at me scornfully. That's your habit. You take everything from me. Even, my mother! Do you love him? lf l say so. Are you gonna leave him? lf you want to... And, Ifve never thought about him considerably. You don't have to care about me. Its honest. Don't be foolish. l don't need your permission. Somehow, he'll be my lover. l lit on your birthday cake candles. l wish, we blow out the candles together. But Im sorry l couldn't. Im alright. Don't keep in your mind about today. And have a good sleep. You, too. Please! Don't... Ill give you... Its not of your business. Did Hyejin go to somewhere? Yes, l think she went to the school. And mother... l took your money from your desk. For book and water paint. l should have told you before... Because l was in hurry. Im sorry. That's okay. What's matter with you? Can't l love with you but Jiae? Why? Could it be decided that who is your lover or not? Is it? l didn't mean to... But at least, love is not something that could be stolen by someone. That's a commit theft! A commit theft? l know you are here. l... just come here to return your... apartment key. Jiae! And thank you for your kindness. Hey! You are... How perfect you are! You've always made all as you calculated. Hyejin! The reason, l leave you, is not because of her. But Ifve never thought about you considerably. Please! Don't... l know you. What do you know about me? Do you think me virgin? l can sleep with anybody whom l want to. You can sleep with me as my last gift for you. And l won't see you again. Jiae! Hey! Would you want to spend time with me? Get away! l just want to spend time with you. That's all! Get away from my face? Damn girl. What a dirty mouth! Damn it! Do well! Who are you? Im the person who can alarm dirty mouth up. Get away! Come on! Im gonna kick your damn ass! Hyejin! Are you out of your mind? You hit me? Im sorry. This way. Look at this! They fought on the street. But you can take her to home. Thank you. You must go to the obstetrics and gynecology with me. What? Bye! Don't touch me! What do you mean? Obstetrics and gynecology? He said that his aunt delivered a new baby. So, l would go to the hospital for regard her. l can't understand you! You drunk everyday... Even, fighting on the street. We lost our respect each other for long time ago. Is that way to speak to mother? You're becoming more worst than ever. Even, you committed theft. Im tired of you. Me either. l don't want to be as like a tame dog. Anyway, you already have good daughter but me. l was the despair of you since you married. Are you okay? He couldn't sleep day and night because of you. You must apologize to father. Im so exhausting. l said! Apologize to him! How could he be my father? Don't you remember? My father's dead! Shut up! Apologize to him! My father's dead. Dead! Honey! Why... you so hurt my heart? What am l supposed to do? Just leave me alone. Treat me as a stranger. Leave me alone please! Hyejin... l hate everything. This house. Even, my mother. Hyejin. Open the door! Hyejin! - Victory! - Victory! She couldn't associate with family. l think, it was very hard to accept new father for her. You mean... You're right. We don't have same blood. But Ifve never thought she is not my sister. And she's breaking heart by herself. Ifve never seen her that interesting in anybody with enthusiasm. She loves you very much. But, l don't... She needs someone who can take care of her. That's you. lf you refuse her love... Something would happen to her. She'd be as like orphan. She needs love. Don't you want to stop to say hello to me? This is for... Are you still serving for orphans? You must be tired to lecturing! How can you understand them who takes everything for advance? You don't know anything about the business. Sometime, business man must be coldness. Is it fair that you forced to them out from their nest for your profit? Im very ashamed that you are my father. Do you know her? You're my son who will inherit my business. You can't be with her. She is my lover. l will marry her. Ill go. Im sorry... Never kissed anybody to be said sorry. Your parents are so silly! Because they prevent what really you want to do. How could they make you to be lawyer? How's going with him? He looks like different than me. He doesn't love me. Ifve always ignored the love. l thought, the love is not worth to have. But l can understand who desires to get lover. He must be more silly than my parents. He doesn't like you... Why don't we make event... What we should go to the obstetrics and gynecology? She is very nice woman. She's always come to here to take care of children once a week. My mother taught me how to play piano. She was very kindness and warmness. But she's dead when l was child. And l couldn't play piano anymore. Because my father doesn't like to do. You reminded me my mother. You're very warm person than l thought. Jinwoo! l won't say sorry. It saves me from slap. Lady! Let's talking about damn life? Are you trying to tempting me? What! Tempting... l just want to cure our loneliness. Why not! l feel so lonely. l know... l know... You look lonely... You look like a lonely bird. Hey! What are you doing? Don't underestimate me! What's matter with you? Everyman always treats woman with sexual instinct. Disgusting! Im sick of this! You're as same as we are... aren't you? You came here to pick someone up. Didn't you? Jiae! What's matter with you? Why...? Shouldn't Ifve drunk? Take a rest. Let's talk tomorrow. Father! l feel so miserable! Are you gonna cut clan off? When are you gonna deliver a baby? Say something! Father! It is out of our ability to having a baby. We can't help it! Promise me that you would deliver a baby before l were died. Is it guilty not to having a baby? When are you gonna stop to demanding her to get a baby? Hyejin! Why don't you say anything? What is so important to having a baby? Don't you stop it! How did you educated her that she interrupted while Im speaking. Father! How could you make trouble every time. l ashamed on him! They, still, insist to having a baby. Shut up! Do you know that how much we're having hard time because of you. So do l! Do you know that how much this house makes me sick. Ill step out from this house. That's one way to solve our problems. Hyejin! Let her do... whatever she wants to do. Hello... Jiae! Hyejin left home yesterday. l have no idea where she went to. And, l cannot... What? Hyejin... l didn't have any place to go. So... Do you know, how much l was worrying about you. Im very glad that you're worrying about me. Im so freezing. Can l have a cup of coffee. Actress must act smoothly. O... look at her... Look carefully. Every love requires something even death. Hyejin! Are you okay? Hyejin? What's wrong? Hyejin, are you okay? Im okay. l can't say anything now. l get your examine result. Nothing's gonna happen to me, isn't it? l hope so... Have a nice day. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? He's my old timer who gave me translate job. What kind of... He's my boyfriend! Oh! Really. l wish, l can date with her since she's very pretty. Yet, she's your girlfriend. Here is which l translated. Very good! Since Im with you. Can l ask something? Yes. Are you very kind to me because you're against your father? Who's gonna fall in love because he resists somebody? Do you love me? Foolish! How could l describe it? lf you can't describe it... Show me! Now? lf you're kiss me, Ill believe you. Look at that! Here it is! The patient Yoon Hyejin should come with family. Is it worst? Yes. Its a cancer! And, a cancerous cells processes so rapidly. She has only two or three months to live. It'll suffer her pain so awfully even weak eye sight. Stop drinking! l can't believe it! What Ifve done? Why me... Why? Why! l wouldn't die! And l won't pray for my life. Something's wrong! Why... Why me? This is not a place where you can enter and out publicly. That's enough! She comes back to home. But how can l predict. What's she gonna do tomorrow? Are you gonna satisfy if l weren't be here? That's all you can say to me? Have you ever been good to your family? l couldn't sleep several days and nights to worrying about you. l always feel miserable when l think of you... Mother! Are you alright? Mother... Mother! She is pregnant. What? Pregnant. Is it... Honey! What a happy event! Eat something good for you. It must be son. Take care of you and keep a complete rest. You must take care of you. Yes, Father. Honey, help yourself. Yes, yes... Help yourself. Yes, Father. Don't you ashamed on you. What makes you so proud to be have a baby. You should finish your dish. That's okay... Do you eat tonic medicine which l brought for you? Yes. l have to know, what's matter with you. l have nothing to say. l can't understand. What happen between us? Do you want me to explaining? l don't interested in you anymore! l just tired of you. Is it enough? Leave me alone! l have to know! What's matter with you? Do l have to get any reason? When l became irritate somebody. Hyejin! l don't have anything to say. Leave her alone! Don't force to her whatever she doesn't want to do. Its not of your business. Don't ask me anything. l don't love him anymore. Why? He has lover. You lie. You still love him very much. No, l don't! You can't lie to me. Something's happened to you, isn't it? Hello... Hyejin! Long time no see. What are you doin' here? Ifve appointment with Hyejin. Strange... so do l. Im leaving now. How could you make me so miserable. Jinwoo was my lover. Im, still, having hard time when l think of him. My heart has been broken by you. Take him again! You're very selfish. You had to get everything. Even, when you're child. l gave you everything as my sister. But you... That's who you are. Ifve never forced you to do. You're always willing to do. To be as if you're angel. Alright! l did it because l wanted to do. But it always comes from bottom of my heart. You're so uncontrollable. l don't want to be forgiven by you. l always dislike you. Ifve always hatred you since you break into my life. You don't know what love is. It is useless to love who is not thanked. It was too much for you. Are you lecturing about love even you're lost your lover by me? Do you know why l approached to him? Because he was your love. l just wanted to take him over from you. But l don't need him anymore. As l did always. You are evil! We shouldn't have been sister. You are not my sister anymore! Jinwoo. How are you? Have you met Hyejin, recently? She is... Hyejin! Why didn't you tell me? Do you think you can hide from me? What am l suppose to say? l have a limited number of hour. So you must love me. And love me until l were dead. Do l have to say this? You don't have to care about me. This is my problem. No one could help me. l won't let you die. Ill be with you. Its too late. Im dying even l couldn't believe it. l can feel. The shadow of death towards to me, so rapidly. Hyejin. No, no. No, l regretted that you are with me. You don't have to lie to me. Do you think Ill give you up. Im so afraid. Im afraid not only Im dying but also l won't exist on the earth. Jinwoo! l don't want to die! l want to be with you forever. But l can't. Im dying... Don't be afraid. Im here. Jinwoo. Hands muscle would be palsied when cancer develops. You'd better say nothing for a while. She doesn't want to be sprayed out. l didn't know, l thought... What's gonna happen to her? Do you want to come with me? l just want to watch you. You know. l wasn't good at anybody. Recently, l regretted what Ifve done. Don't hurt anybody. Especially, to your parents who concerns you very much. Is it possible? How could l change me instantly? You can do it. First, you should register for class again. And stop fighting and drinking. Can you promise me? Ifve never promised for anything. Do you think, you can die in peace after l made promise? You're right. It isn't hard to changing me. But l would not able to see you again, if I promise you. You're gonna be here when you want to check me out. Ok, we shouldn't make a promise. Promise makes people miserable. What is it? Ticket for travel. l thought you suppose to arrange for lecture. l finished it. It is not good for you. This kind of moment remind me that Im dying. Hyejin. Even l want to forget it. l can't stand with it. Im sorry. l didn't mean to remind you. Im just angry. l irritate that you are so kindness. Day is being past. And walking people on the street. Even, me who has to waiting for death. l can't help to be anger. And Im mad at me. Who is useless for you. You've never been useless. You would understand what l mean. After l left you. And when you get hard time because of my death. Don't imagine anything. Just think. We're together right now. That might help... Thank you. Can't you come to home little bit early? And can't you help Jiae... she's doing everything for house. l might helpful when l left here. You are so... Im gonna travel with Jinwoo. You are so unpredictable. Mother, let her go. Sure, as you always does. Mother, let her do whatever she wants to do. He told you, didn't he? l didn't know... l misunderstand you. What's matter with everybody? l would be gone forever. Who has been despaired from family. Isn't it joyful? Hyejin. Why are you hurting yourself? And why are you trying to concealing you. Even to me. Im your sister. You don't have to be defendant. l don't want to be weak. It means, l admire death. You must be broken your heart because of me. No! l regret, l wasn't good for you as your sister. Itfll hurt me for long time. Don't be sad because of me! My sister. Please forgive me. My sister. l hurt you because l couldn't be as like you. And l always envied you. Ifve never approached to him to hurt you. But Ifve always loved him since l met him. And l even, slap you. Without trying to understand you. Do you know when l felt so gladdest? That was when you slapped me. That moment, l felt l paid for what Ifve done to you. And Im very regretted what Ifve done to you. My sister. l feel very sorry to you than anybody. l want to pay off to you. lf l have enough time to do. But l don't have... No, you won't die. You'll always be with us. Sister! Sister. Please take care of mother even though... What are you talking about? And what do you mean? You wouldn't able to live anymore. Its not true. Why my beautiful daughter should be died? It is not a true isn't it. Something's wrong! Something... Mother... Its true, you must believe it. Im regretting not only true of my death but also broke your heart. Mother... Ifve never execrated you. l know... Ifve never disliked you. l was hurt by that l couldn't help you. You're my daughter. There are no mother who hates their daughter. Im sorry mother. l don't have enough time to be good daughter. l wish, l would be able to see a new baby. l think, l could do everything for my family... Im so miserable. Ill save you. l won't let you go to anywhere. l will always be with you even in your wedding day. You know, l can't live without you. Mother... My daughter! Father and Mother. Im sorry Ifve hurt you. Forgive me. What Ifve done. l wish, l would able to see a baby. It must be son. My sister. You're so kindness to me. Ill leave with your love. That you're always kept in your heart. Sister! Please, take good care of mother. My friend who told me that promise makes people miserable. People could live cheerfully if they'll die tomorrow. l believed, you promised me, you wouldn't hurt anybody. l... want to walk on the beach. l love you. Ifve never expected that word makes me feel sorrowful. It is miserable that l can't be with whom l love forever... Hyejin. lf l could feel your breath at this time. l dislike a good natured person. My heart is hurt. When l remind them. My love. Every love requires something. Im very happy that you love me. l thanked you. You love me. That made me realize how it is thankful to having lover in my life. Even though, life never waits for us... My lover... Im falling in sleep... l can hear sound of the piano... Could l hear it... when l awake from my dream...
