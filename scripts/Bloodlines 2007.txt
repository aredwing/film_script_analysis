It's across the street from the old American gas station that's closed down. I'm about three hours from school. So, uh... How's my Teddy Bear? Oh, he's been mopin' around like a lost pup ever since you left. God, I haven't seen him this sad since ma and pa passed away. See, I knew it. This was a mistake, I'm coming home. Like hell you are. I didn't raise no quitter. Bearwill be just fine. What if I can't do this? Oh, Amber, that's horse shit, We've talked about this. You're just nervous, like always. Listen, Baby Girl. Do you think they would've wasted a scholarship on someone they don't believe in? I guess not. What's our motto? The strength is in the Strickland. It's always there, don't you neverforget it, okay? Me and Bearwill always be here foryou. You're the best, Brody. And will you tell Teddy Bear that I love my gift. I will, Baby Girl. We love you.

You thinking about them nasty whores? I don't want them here. Yeah, well it don't matter what you want. It's what pa wants. That's crazy talk, you run this family, not pa. I want us to have a baby... Goddamn it, that's sick! You're my fuckin' sister. You want some little turd snatcher like Royce or Squirm popping out of you? Now get yourturd clippers out ofthere and get out. - But, Billy... - Go on! Time to go to work. Sheriffto base, I'm-a be out at the Stricklands'. Man: Right. Brody. Take a seat, sheriff. I called the school. Her roommate said she never showed up. What are campus police oing? You did report it, right? Brody, my hands are tied for 48 hours. Ah, come on. She's not officially missing yet. Maybe she just got sidetracked. It ain't out ofthe ordinary for a college girl to forget to call her kin. Amber ain't ordinary. There's nothing more I can do. Yeah? Well, there's something I can do. Listen, I'll call ya if I hear anything. We're gonna find Baby Girl. You wanted to see me? Oh, yeah. Tell your pa he'll have to run things until we get back.
