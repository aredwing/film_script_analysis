All I need is for you to tell me to... Another one that's late. What's your name, what did you bring? Oh, the foxes. Wait over there at the side... They thought they'd be able to use lots of museum pieces, but half of them are ruined. I told them that, but they didn't listen. The Pole's going crazy. - Hungarian. - Eh? - He's Hungarian, not Polish. - Oh, Hungarian. - So what did you bring? - Some foxes. You? The pumas, the jaguars, the casuarias... Most of them came out of a diorama I did a couple of years ago. I hardly brought anything new. - Good business. - You could say that. Sontag! The curators want you to have a look at the dioramas on the third floor. They need a report and an estimate. Start with the rainforests. - Now? - Yes, now. Don't smoke in here. It doesn't bother her, does it, darling? Say "Ah". - How's all that going? - Fine. The same... - Do you still get the... - Now and again. - Remember that time? - Yes. I remember every time. OK. Let's go to Administration. I've already had enough of this place. Pay day. How much do you think they've got? - Not this again. - How much? - I don't know. - Have a guess. I haven't got the slightest idea. Two guys with two bags each. Each bag on average... holds 10 bundles of fifty So? Plus the same amount that's inside already. They bring it in the day before, for security reasons. Hard to believe they've got that much, with the shit wages they pay. - Waiting. - Waiting for what? For someone to do something. Want me to tell you how? You're going to tell me anyway. Like when you told me how to rob the Agricultural Convention. See how he's got his back turned? You could just walk right up to him. He's not even looking. Have you got a light? Don't move. - Now... - Everybody on the floor! It's all in the timing. You mustn't waste a second. Handcuffing them, that takes... Telephones, alarm. In the treasury, no one's realized yet. On the floor! - How much time was that? - 20 seconds. It's the moment to close the door. Just one way in. Didn't you spot it? - No. - I did. How much time? They put away the cash. They close everything up. - One minute. - Time's up. How do they get out? The old catwalks exit. They've never blocked that up. Easier to hide it. And nobody would remember it was there. Except me. The catwalks lead directly to the other wing of the building. While the guards are getting together in the main entrance... we leave from the other side. We leave from the other side? Okay, they leave. All very neat. It can be done neatly. It can be done well. And if it's that easy, why aren't people robbing them all the time? People are robbing all the time, but they do it badly. Because they're idiots. The police and the criminals, all of them. I still don't get what's stopping you. - It's a game. - And you're the best player. I pay attention. I don't forget a single thing I see. Tell me the serial numbers on the bags. ABF 869, HFD 444. And what if something goes wrong? What if someone dies? There's no reason why anyone should die. Yes, there's a reason. There's a load of guys with guns. The typical situation in which people die. No, not if everything's properly planned. What the fuck are you talking about? Who do you think you are? Billy the Kid? You've got a very weird fantasy for a taxidermist... who's never got into a fight with anyone. Not even once. Not at school, not in the street, not anywhere. Anything you say may be used against you. Since you like action so much, I've got a better game for you. Tomorrow I'm going deer hunting down south. I was going with Aguirre but the pansy got sick, and I'm stuck with the tickets. We'll rent you a rifle, and have a good time. - I don't like killing animals. - You don't have to kill anything. Just go for a stroll, get the smell of formaldehyde out of you, take a few pot-shots. You should try it someday, or wouldn't your wife let you? - I'm going. - Don't you want your money? - Some other time. - I'll call you about the trip. - I'm not going. - I'll call you anyway. Mariana... Yes, I'm going to go. I gave it some thought and I've made my mind up. Nothing... Nothing in particular... I just thought... a change of air would do me good. Yes, hunting too, the whole deal. Eh? Her? No, she agrees. Yeah, she thinks it's a good idea. She says what's good for me is good for both of us. What time do we leave? What airline? Okay. I'll see you there. Thursday We can't stay here. They haven't got any rooms. It's all full up. Sontag! Listen, I don't want you to go off angry. The situation got out of control. It's not just us. I just called the other hotels. They're all full up. There's not a single free bed in the whole valley. And you didn't make a reservation. I've never needed a reservation. But this is a special weekend. The casino is closing next week... and people are coming from everywhere. What the fuck do I care? I came here to hunt. - Where are you going to go? - To fuck my mother. Listen. - Do you know Dietrich's cabins? - Who? Dietrich. He's a local. Takes people hunting and stuff. He's got cabins further north in the middle of the woods. - I don't know him. - Well, they're not really for tourists. - Actually, his place is kind of... ...shitty. Listen, I wouldn't recommend it if you had any other options. But if you've come to hunt, maybe this will suit you better. It's closer to the grounds. What do you think? Nothing. How do I get there? Hey. Hey! What do you want? Somewhere to stay for 3 or 4 days. No. We haven't got any room. So where are all the other guests then? In the sauna? No room. What part of that didn't you understand? Yes, there is room. My brother made a mistake. There's one cabin available. Follow me. Sign here please. - Me too? - No, one is enough. - What's your name? - Diana. Is this your father? No... that's my husband. - Dietrich? - Yes. - This is a 14 point red stag, isn't it? - I think so. - Where is it? - I don't know. Not here anyway. The cabin is that one opposite. If you want me to make you breakfast, let me know. Or any other meal. It's no problem. There are no other hunters. - There's nobody. - I thought that... Don't listen to Julio. My husband's in charge here. And if he isn't here, it's me. - Where is he? - I don't know. Hunting, I guess. If you want him as a guide, I can try to get him on his cell phone. You can get a signal here? The casino put up an antenna. It works for the whole valley. Shall I call him? No, we'll go on our own, tomorrow first thing. - To Junquillo? - Further north, closer to Pilauquen. - No one ever goes there. - That's exactly why we're going there. I wanted to rent a rifle for my friend but now we're too far away. - Can you rent us one? - Yes... Do you want to see them? Come with me. Now you've got a gun. Friday Stay close. If we get separated, you won't know how to get back. You walk 4 or 4 km west to get to the river, then you turn right, go 2 km more. That's where we left the jeep, past the clearing. - I know perfectly well how to get back. - You're a real woodsman... Good spatial memory. I've always had it, even as a kid. I never get lost. You have to have one skill to make up for the rest. - That was on purpose, wasn't it? - No. You did that on purpose! You didn't want me to kill it. What's wrong with you, you jerk? You're the master criminal, but you can't bear to see an animal's blood? I must be a jerk too. Why the fuck did I bring you along? Come on, dickhead. Let's go. It's too late for deer now. What's wrong with you? You don't know me. What? You're going to hunt? You're going to hunt a deer? You're going to aim at it? Shoot it? You're going to kill it? Well, go on then you prick, show me. Leave me alone. But watch out. When you kill it, it's all over. No more fauns, no more forest, no more nothing. You're really going to kill a deer? You've got to have a lot of balls to do that, you know? What kind of balls? The same kind you need to beat the shit out of your wife... and ruin her life? HUNTING LICENSE CARLOS DIETRICH Are you leaving too? What? Your friend's going. He's already paid the bill. He's packing. Are you leaving too? I'm not sure. I have to talk to him. You made it, then? I'm going back. Marta's in the hospital. Who? My wife, asshole. The one whose life I ruined. She mixed sleeping pills with alcohol. Not enough to kill herself, but enough to keep pissing me off. What are you going to do? Here's your ticket, I'll take the jeep. - Don't worry. - I won't. Did you hunt anything? Come on. I haven't got time. Wait a second. - Ouch! - Just stay still! I'm almost done. Where is he? I don't know where he is. Where is he, Julio? - Gently! - When's he going to come? I don't know. - He's got some other place, hasn't he? - Another place? Some other house. Where he hides away, - You're crazy. - Don't fuck with me. Where's the 14 point stag? He hunted it, he took photos, he had it stuffed but he never brought it home. - What did he do, eat it? - I don't know. Why do you care? You just want to get out of here. I know. But there's work to do and I end up doing it. Well, then call him! I don't know, leave him a message! Don't bust my balls! - I just want to know where he is. - He'll be back soon. You've already put up with so much. It's just one more weekend. - What? - Nothing. - What did you say? - Nothing. - What's happening this weekend? - Nothing, forget it. - Tell me! - I told you, nothing! Come here, let me finish... Julio! Dietrich? Yes? Dietrich. We're here to see him. He's not here. May I sit down? He told us to come now.... Today. - How far have we driven? - 800 km. He told us to come at this time. Where is he? I'm sure he'll be back any minute now. He told me he was expecting people. Expecting you. - And he said he liked the idea... - You're the kid. - The brother-in-law. - Yes. We'll come back tomorrow. He should be back tomorrow. - There's room if you want to stay... - We'll be back tomorrow. Julio... Julio! Have you decided what you're going to do, then? I thought I'd stay a bit longer. Dietrich, it's Vega. It's about Cerro Verde. We have to talk. I'll call you later. Vega again. #Listen. I know what you told me, but I've got to do the Cerro Verde job. I tried to get out of it, but they got nervous here. Started asking questions. And we don't want that. Anyway, it's an easy job. Saturday morning - hardly anyone's around. Not much security. It'll be easy. Monday we'll do our job. It'll be fine. And I've already got the key. It wasn't easy, but I got it back. Don't bust my balls, it's hanging around my neck. I'm not going to lose it this time. OK, I'll call you when I can. Bye. Saturday The next time I see him on my land, day or night... I swear on my kids' lives I'll kill him. Talk to my husband, it's his dog. Some animal is killing his sheep. He says it's our dog. And is it? Lucky you turned up. He only comes when my husband's not here. - Do you want a coffee? - No, thanks. Actually, I need a car. If you know anyone... For how long? I don't know... a couple of days. I can give you my pick-up, it's that one behind the cabin. I don't want to leave you without a car. No, don't worry. If I need it, I'll let you know. - You've got a license, haven't you? - No... But I'm a good driver. I've been driving since I was a kid. So? I'm epileptic. Is that why they won't give you a license? They say you could have a fit while you're driving. Could you? It's never happened to me. But if that's a problem, I understand. No. What are they like? The fits I mean. Do they hurt? No... No, they don't hurt. And do they come on all of a sudden? Well, no... A few seconds before it happens I know I'm going to have an attack. There's a moment... a shift... The doctors call it an aura. Things suddenly change. It's as if... as if everything stopped, and a door opened in your head, that lets things in. What things? Sounds... Music... Voices... Images... Smells... The smell of school, of kitchen, of family... It tells me the fit is coming and there's nothing you can do... to stop it... nothing. It's horrible... And it's perfect... because during those few seconds, you're free... There's no choice, there's no alternative, nothing for you to decide. Everything tightens up, gets narrower... And you surrender yourself. There's a place I heard about... I'd like to go to. Maybe you know it, Cerro Verde? Cerro Verde. Yes, but it's not a tourist spot, it's a factory. It's on the north side of town. I must have got it wrong. Thanks anyway. Get out of here! Go on! Away! Get away, I said. Away. Urien, 10/4, $67.000 ...one driver and one guard... Don't forget the third man. Turco's number. Montero - Sosa. Is Julio coming? Talk to Vega. Every monday. Armoured cash transport. Crew: Driver and Guard. Get in. Get in... come on... Excuse me sir, no entry without a tie. What do you mean, without a tie? That's the house rule. Black, 33. Red, 30. The third dozen. Now it's the third dozen, first column. Then the first dozen, second column, second dozen, third column, and so on. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. It's on the house. Come on. Nice chips. Blue and orange. The casino doesn't use them anymore. - What? - Took them out of circulation. But since some customers still have them... they accept them. Well, not some customers... One. Just one customer who asked them to keep those colours. And since by this stage he'd already lost a lot of money... I mean, a very good customer, they let him keep his colours. Blue and orange. - What would you like? - Nothing. - Soda water. - Black label for me. That's good, soda water. Not a good idea to mix Tegretol with alcohol. It's an old talent that supported me for many years. A good trade. Even if it is a bit old fashioned now. But they still work, huh? Do you stick your fingers into every customer's pockets? My relationship with the casino is based on mutual needs. So the casino asks me to look around while I play, to see if anyone's trying to take advantage... or use the hooks. In exchange, the casino has someone who helps unlucky players... play a little longer. I give out loans, "informally". So, to answer your question: No, I don't stick my fingers... in every customer's pocket. Only the ones who have a sign on their foreheads saying: "I've never been in a casino in my fucking life". But you know all this anyway, don't you? I mean, is that it? Is what it? Come with me. Come with me or I'll have security rip off your balls... and make you swallow them. Come on. What's wrong? I don't like riddles, and I don't like bullshit. Does Dietrich have something to tell me? - What do want me to say? - Are you fucking with me? He didn't come yesterday, he hasn't called or confirmed. And now he sends some guy to the casino playing his chips, his system, and wearing his fucking tie! Are you fucking with me? You're fucking with me, right? Where is Dietrich? He couldn't come. He has a problem. So? He asked me to come in his place. And why all the shit with the tie and the chips? Why didn't you come straight to me? He said if I showed this stuff first, you'd trust me. And who are you, anyway? A friend, from the capital. Fine. Let's suppose that's fine. The thing is... Are we on? There's no backing out now. There can't be. It's all set for Monday. Are we on, or not? Dietrich says we're on. Tell Dietrich not to fuck up. The truck leaves at 8 o'clock on Monday... and that's the last trip ever. He better not fuck up. He owes me too much money, right? $67,000. Exactly. And he lost most of it playing that shit system he taught you. Monday. Yes? I wanted... ...a coffee. Anything else? No. Take a seat, I'll bring it over. You'll have to wait a bit, I need to make a fresh pot. - Hi. - Hi. Did you do the drawings? Yes. Catalina, Cristian, Ayelen and me. Lili doesn't paint because she's very young. - Do you all live here? - Not all of us. Some come with their mummies and then go home. And do you live here? Sometimes... Only when Tamara works in the little rooms. Who's Tamara? My mum, but she doesn't like to be called "Mum". She likes to be called "Tamara". Do you want to sit down? - Did you do that one? - Yes. - Who's that? - That's Uncle Richard. But he's not my uncle. He's a friend of my mum's, from when I was little. That's why I call him uncle. - Does he come often? - Yes, every week... and he brings me presents. He brought me this. And the other one? That's Uncle Luis. But he isn't much of an uncle. - Your drawing is very nice. - Thank you. Come here, Vanina. Come over here, I said! - Bye. - Bye. Fuck me. How far have we walked? - 200 metres? - No, 100. Something like that. Fucking hell. So then, what's the deal? - What do you mean? - Listen. We drive 800 km to get here. When we get here, the guy who called us isn't here. We wait for him, and he doesn't show up. But the guy who is here is an asshole who won't talk to us, but he has the other guy's cell phone. So let's start from the beginning. Why have you got Dietrich's phone? Because he left it with me, along with the other stuff. The other stuff? The photos, the spreadsheets with the casino's accounts, everything. Oh, it's a casino. Your names. Sosa and Montero. Although I don't know who's who. And where's Dietrich? Dietrich's gone. I don't know where. He left everything with me and took off. Because of the Vega thing. Vega was going to be involved too but... he died in a shoot-out with the police. Dietrich got scared. He thought they might trace it back to him, and this whole job would fall apart. He called me... - I thought he'd told you about me. - No. He told me about him. Not about you. I saw Dietrich a few weeks ago in Buenos Aires. He told me all about this job. He told me everything. Every detail. I liked it. It sounded good. And why didn't you say anything last night? The girl was there. Besides, you didn't give me a chance. You left. Let's go. Now. Let me think. Let's get out of here. This is crazy. Crazy? Why? - We don't know him. - We don't know Dietrich either, but here we are. This guy could be anyone, he could be... What? A cop? Kill him then. If he's a cop, kill him right now and let's go home. We agree then. He's not a cop. Not in a thousand years. Dietrich said a friend from Buenos Aires would be in this too. Why didn't you say that before? He only mentioned it once. Now that this guy says it... He mentioned it... Okay, fill me in. The casino, the Lauquen, is on route 24. Every Monday, they bring the money from the weekend to the bank in town. They use an armoured truck. Always the same one. With a team of two men. And it's always the same two men. The truck leaves the casino takes route 14... and then takes route 3 to town. On route 14, there's a bar. Actually, it's a brothel. It's isolated, in the middle of nowhere. The truck always stops there. And the men get out. Both of them. I was the one who found that out. I told Dietrich. That's why he said I could be in, when the job went ahead. Dietrich has a contact in the casino. A guy he owes a lot of money to. - Who? - A guy. Someone who has access to almost everything. And who realised that the only way to get his money back, was to help him with the job. The guy gave him everything. Internal documents, schedules, the routes, the figures... How much? On a regular weekend, And over a long weekend, double that, or more. - Yesterday was... - Holiday. A long weekend. And this is the last trip. The casino is closing. They're moving it. So it's Monday or never. - Not bad. - It is bad. It's bad. How can you be sure they'll stop there... ...and that they'll feel like fucking? - No, that's not why they stop. One of the guys has a daughter. It's her they go to see. Every Monday. This is a joke. Who'll give the orders if the other guy isn't here? You? You'll be the boss? My boss? - Hey! - What? Finished? Have you made your point? You can't do this with this guy. What I can't do is go back empty-handed. You're going to pay the Turk in Buenos Aires? Or rather, you're going to explain why we can't pay him yet again? How much is there in the truck anyway? Two and a half million, at least. Did you see what just happened? - You can't go with this guy... - I'll go with whoever I have to. Not with this guy. With you, as usual. This is something we can do. Come on, let's go. - Does the girl know? - No. Keep it that way. The less she knows, the better. - What time is it? - Midnight. Let's get some sleep. Open a cabin for me. We'll go over the rest of the details tomorrow. Another 200 meters. For fuck's sake. If anybody left now, they'd hear. And why would I go? I thought they were going to kill you. So did I. Is he coming back? I already explained what happened. - He got scared, and... - No. They don't know him, but I do. He doesn't get scared. And he never said anything about a friend from Buenos Aires. Why did you tell them that, then? Is he coming back? And if I said he wasn't? Then none of this would be necessary. I wouldn't need the money to get out of here. And the money is in the armoured truck. Is he coming back? He said he was. After a while. He said he was. Sunday I didn't know you knew each other. Yes, we might go hunting. Hunting... That's why they're waiting for my husband. Yes. - Are you going out? - Why? I'm going into town and if you're not using the pick-up... I can give you a lift if you like. There's no need. Anyway your friends are waiting for you. They're not my friends. I can take you if you like. Take a right here. You're going to church. - Why? Does that surprise you? - No, it's just... I don't know. I didn't think you were a religious person. And what does a religious person look like? Sorry, I didn't mean... It's a place to go. A place of my own. - That's good. I'm sorry. - No need to apologize. Thanks for the lift. I can make my own way back. I can come and pick you up if you like. I've got something to do. I can pick you up when I'm done. All right. Whatever you like. The key to the interior safe is kept at the final destination. The drivers cannot open it. It floods sometimes. Takes a while, and it'll start up again. You just have to wait. How did you end up here? - That's odd. - What? You, starting a conversation. How did I end up here or how did I end up with a guy 30 years older than me? Because that's what they always ask me. Dietrich was a friend of my father's. I had to get out. And it seemed like the only way to get away from home. It wasn't very hard. The day he came to get me, my dad went mad and confronted him. Dietrich beat him so badly, it took him a week to recover. And I left with him. With the first punch, I realised he was made of the same shit... Nothing had changed. But it was already too late by then. Why don't you leave? No. I left once. Dietrich came looking for me, and he found me. He'll find me. Always. Who are you waiting for? Nobody. Should I be waiting for someone? Don't play dumb. What's going on? Nothing. They're waiting for Dietrich, to go hunting. - We need to talk. - Get off! Piss off, will you? Don't tell me what to do! Go and fuck yourself! - Where have you been? - She asked me to... We have to talk. We have to sort things out. - Yes, let's go to the... - To the brothel. And finish sorting things out. Well? The truck's going to be there, out front. - There, in full view? - Yes. Yeah, they don't give a shit. The guards come out. We're waiting for them. They have no time to react. We tie them up. We take them over to the truck. They open the back door... With our faces uncovered? Dietrich asked me to buy ski masks. I've already got them. They open the back door. We go in, grab the money bags. Put them in the truck. Then we close the door, load up the car, and we're gone. If we do it right, it won't take more than a minute, 90 seconds. Good, good. - It's possible. - What about the kid? With his face covered, he's another man. - Do you have a gun? - Yes, Dietrich gave me one. Put it away. And what are you going to do? Where are you going to be? In the casino. Making sure the truck leaves on time. With no back-up. Right. Far away from everything. Why don't you stay in the cabin playing cards with the girl? All right, take it easy. We'll take care of it. He'll let us know if there are any problems. What problem could there possibly be? He wants to stay out of it, so that we don't realize we don't need him. There's something else. The key to the door isn't enough. The truck has an interior safe. The guards can't open it, even if they wanted to. - We need another key. - You're telling us now, asshole? Why didn't you tell us before? Who's got that key? I've got it. Then we have everything we need. I want that key later. - Hand it over. - I haven't got it on me. Monday - Julio, where are you going? - Leave me alone. What's going on? What are you doing? Something I have to do. Leave me alone. - You're not going anywhere! - Let go of me! Dietrich isn't coming back. Ever. What happened? Come with me. - Where's Vega? - Vega? It's 8:14. Where's Vega? - Vega can't make it. - He can't make it? What the fuck are you talking about? It's all fine, even if he doesn't come. What do you mean, "Even if he doesn't come"? It's fine, I have the key. He gave it to me. Who gives a fuck about the key?! If Vega isn't inside the truck, who's going to open the door from the inside? The two guards will get out. Nobody's left inside the truck. It's a long weekend, you motherfucker! Three days' worth! They put three men in the truck! There's a third man inside the truck, and Dietrich knows that perfectly well. It took me two months to get them to take Vega on as a guard. Two months' careful work to get him inside the truck. And now Vega isn't here and they're putting in some dick that I don't know. A new guy who doesn't know anything. Don't forget the third man. Driver and two guards. Crew: 3. Dietrich didn't... he didn't tell me... You haven't got a clue. Who are you? Where did you come from? - I've got to warn the others... - It's over. I'm out. I want nothing to do with this. Nothing, do you hear me? And if Dietrich tries to get me involved, I swear I'll kill him. Montero! Son of a bitch! It's your fault you piece of shit! Stop it! Leave him alone! That shit fucked us over. Can't you see? We still have the truck. Let's sort this out first. - What about that? - It's nothing. I can hold on. Open up, you son of a bitch! No, I won't open it! Keep crying, faggot! Wait until I get you out of there! I'm hurt, motherfucker! They're watching us. Take that off! He's locked the door from the inside. We need tools. It's an old truck, it can be opened. - We should get out of here. - No shit, genius. And how are we going to sort this out? I know a place where there are tools. Are there other people there? No, nobody knows where it is. - But first we need a doctor. - No, first the truck, then the doctor. Let's go then. We'll follow you in the pick-up. Take the truck. The key must be on one of the guards. And you drive, kid. Did you like the trip, faggot? Are you going to open up? How are you? You know what this is like. If you don't die during the first ten minutes... - We can wait and get some help. - No, I'm okay. Get the tools first. Okay, show them to me. - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine. There's a welding torch, bolt cutters, a sledgehammer.... In half an hour I'll have it open like a tin can. Are you sure? I'm sure. Come here! It's empty. - Use mine. - No, no. There's a box of 9 mm. Inside. What the fuck were you thinking? Did you really think we'd share the money with you and the kid? Can anyone really be so fucking stupid? You even gave me the key. If it had been Dietrich, well... That guy knows the score, he knows the Turk, but you... You're a freak. The first time I saw you I said, "This isn't going to work." "It can't work." Who would've thought? It worked. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Diana... Diana! Wednesday
