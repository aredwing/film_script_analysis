No. How many times do we have to do this? I know. I gotta make it right, baby. Always so serious. We're gonna be a family... it's different. Yeah. Apache will help us. It's hard leaving you this time. Hey... you're a soldier. Yeah. Good morning. Detective Dan Adams, LAPD. Cushko, Russian Special Intelligence Agency. So what we got going on here today? Well, you play the local, our department should be able to handle the rest. You want cigarette? - No, trying to quit. - Yes, me, too. All right, let's see what this girl got for us. Hey, it's me. I got the rendezvous point. Reyes Creek. Yeah, it'll be good to see you, too, brother. Yeah, well, old times die hard, right? Man, those days are long gone. Yeah, yeah, we can talk about it. All right, later. - Hello? - Hey, babe, it's me. Everything okay? Well, I miss you already. - Miss Laura Wiley? - Yes. Detective Adams, this is Special Agent Cushko. You mind if we come in and ask you a few questions? Please, come on in. Thank you. - Somebody's holding? - Oh, no, not any more. Oh, my God, last night. Hey, girl! Good morning, ladies. We'll be just a few minutes. My bad. Please, have a seat. - Nice place you got here. - Thank you. So, what's all this about? Well, we believe that you have been dating an officer who's gone AWOL for some time. A Lieutenant Colonel Conrad Miller? You happen to know where he is? - AWOL? - Absent without leave. I know what it means, but Conrad, AWOL? He's Mr. Military Guy. - Is he in trouble? - When's the last time you saw him? We had drinks a few weeks back. Now, Miss Wiley, neighbours said they saw him leave this morning. He still has keys. If he came in and didn't say anything, well, you see the boxes. I'm trying to move on. - You guys broke up? - Yeah, it's... it's complicated. On and off again. Try dating a soldier. You didn't perhaps overhear anything that might... well, give you an idea of where he is? Something military related, or perhaps just something out of the ordinary? No, he kept to himself, you know, a really quiet guy. Look, I know this can be very frustrating, but this is just procedure. We really need to know where he is. No, I understand, but I'm not really interested in knowing where he is, you know what I mean? Are you sure about that? Dating Conrad is not the easiest thing in the world. In fact, I can think of a thousand things that are easier. This on-again, off-again situation, waiting by the phone until he calls. Some girls can handle it, some girls can't. Yeah, I get it. Well, look, - we'll let you get back to your Saturday. - Thank you. Remember that he is in a very, very serious situation. - Do the right thing. - Of course. - Miss Wilder, are you here all the time? - Yes. Okay, just take my card and... if you do hear from Mr. Miller, don't hesitate to call us. I won't. Shit. One last thing... aiding and abetting a criminal is a serious offense. - No joke. - I understand. Have a good day. She's definitely covering for him. We call that a Lah-dee-dah chick in my neighbourhood. Then we'll just have to put a little more pressure on her? Copy that. You know you have your traffic duty cops? You have them do a little further research on her. Well, I could... run the plates, do a background check? - Cigarette? - No, I told you I'm trying to quit. Keep this for later? Hello, sir. - $29.10? - Okay. How are you today? How's it look like I'm doing? Hey! You can't do that! Hurry up! Hey. Hello. Are you okay? You want me to call somebody? Give me a tall one. Give me a fucking beer, you bitch! Come on! What the fuck? You're gonna clean this fucking shit with your hands now, you got it? - What's going on with you? - Clean it up! - What are you doing? Clean this shit up! - Stop! Get in the fucking car right now! Not on the Bird! - Clean this shit up! - Stop! - I'm not gonna fucking stop! - Hey... - What? What do you want? - I'm okay, it's not bad. Hey, that's enough. What, are you stupid? You know who the fuck I am? No, I don't know who you are. Fucking asshole. - Hey, you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - What's your name? - Q. Are you crazy? This guy's gonna hurt you. Just get out of here. Motherfu... Really? Prick. It's Q, right? Get out of here. - What are you still doing here, go! Come on. - Okay. Alright. - You got a license? - Yeah. You didn't see anything, right? - Nothing, I saw nothing. - Good. That's what I thought. Here, key to the truck. Title and registration are in the glove box. Be kind to her. Yes! - Is this what you were looking for? - Yeah, thank you. - Hey. You busy? You have a second? - Always. Here's the paper you requested... nothing too special. But I did notice one thing when running the info you gave me. The owner of the house was willed to a Laura Wilder. And you said Wiley. - She said her name was Laura Wiley. - Maybe she meant Wilder? - It's possible. - Anyway, the plates on the car are clean. We're still waiting for more results from the lab. This is what we found on him so far. And this officer is AWOL 72. Shit, it'd be better for everybody if it was 72 hours instead of 24. Yeah, the longer we wait, the longer it takes. Something with this picture don't sit right with me, though. Anything wrong, Detective? What do you see? Have Jones run prints from this. I need it back in two hours. Okay... sir. I'm on it. - Rose? - Yeah. - I didn't forget about dinner. - You better not. - Hello. - Mr. Miller, I have him for you now. - I trust this line is secure? - It is. I wanted to let you know personally your wire came in. When shall we expect you to retrieve funds? In about two days. You know I can't keep this here for more than 48 hours? Even in my country, Interpol doesn't like us doing business with Eastern Europe. That's probably why you guys charge 40% more than any other bank, right? We'll be there in two days. Make sure you get it ready. - You sure you're okay? - Yeah, good. - Just pretty quiet. - Just relaxing. - Conrad's fine, you know. He'll be back. - I know. I don't like it, because when the police come knocking at your door, it's usually never a one-time thing. Rebecca, you've been watching way too much TV. Hey, you saw the guys. Laura knows what she's doing. - It'll get figured out. - It's just weird, that's all I'm saying. Let me guess, somebody's spying on us right now? - Maybe. - Okay, you guys watch too much CSI Miami. Okay, hello, those TV shows have consultants, so it's completely legit. - Yeah, it's totally legit. - Totally legit. Totally. - Hello? - Hey, baby, it's me. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, yeah. You okay? Sorry I hung up on you. I had company today. - Who? - Two men, LAPD and Russian. - What do you want me to do? - Start getting everything ready. I'll be back to pick you up tomorrow. It's now or never, baby. - Laura? - Yes. Keep your friends away from the house, okay? For their own good. Okay. - Be safe. I love you. - Yeah, me, too, baby. You are so co-dependant, you know? There's like classes for that. He leaves, he comes back, he leaves. I don't know why you put up with it. - You deserve better, you are hot shit. - I'm pregnant, that's what I am. - Shut up! - No way! Oh, my God! Wait, does that mean I get to be the godmother? Oh, look, he's back. Good afternoon, ladies. Jesus, you don't have anything better to do on a weekend? What's better than hanging out on the beach, getting some sunlight, - looking at pretty girls? - Jesus. - Am I under investigation, Detective? - No, not yet, but... I have a few questions I want to ask Conrad Miller. Since he's not available, I figured I'd just ask you. All right. Now look, Miss Wilder, just a little more information and I'll be on my way. What would you like to know? Well, I see that you have your house up for sale, and also a boat down at the marina you're trying to sell. So you figured that out in three hours. Yes, my parents left everything to me, including the boat. Just figured I could use the money. If my cop instincts serve me right, I say that your boyfriend put you up to sell everything. - So you and him could run together. - Seriously? He's not my boyfriend, and I'm not running anywhere. He is your friend, right? And he is a boy? Well, actually, I'm in the market for buying a boat. Maybe I could come down to the marina and take a look at yours? I'm showing a potential buyer at 08:00. There won't be any stowaway Marines on there, now will there? Look, Detective, Laura's my best friend, and a seriously honest person. If she was hiding something, I would know about it, and she's not, okay? We're just trying to enjoy ourselves, catch some rays. Paint our toenails... girl stuff. And you're just kind of keeping us from doing that. Your toenails do look nice, if I can say so myself. I'll see you at 8 o'clock in the morning, Miss Wilder. All right. What an asshole! - All right, guys, you gotta go. - What? I'm sorry, I just... you know, I have a headache. - It's just too much for one day. - You sure? - Yeah. - Feel better. She's running. Did you take out the trash? We so shouldn't let it go that... I just finished the dishes, so... Oh, awesome. Sweet. Yeah, anyways, I'm pretty worried about Laura, aren't you? Yeah, I am, too. What do you think is gonna happen? I don't know. I'm just worried for her safety, you know? Yeah, me, too, he better come back. I mean, you think he's gonna come back, right? I'm not sure. He better. Becca? Becca? Whatever. God, I'm gonna text her and see if she's all right. What do you want? Tell me everything you know about Conrad Miller right now. Jesus... the fuck? I didn't even think that worked. We're full, cowboy. I'm the only car out there. I know, but... For real, we ain't open for business. But the light's on, you're here, I'm here, that's gotta mean you're open. Shit, I forgot to turn the no vacancy light on. Look, I just need a bed to chill, I'll be out by sunrise. Wrong motel. We're closed. Well, I feel like it's my lucky day, there's a vacancy sign right there. Well, Mr. Lucky, it ain't your day. Please, come on. Okay. Hey... there's a little town ten miles up, you should try there. Wish I could help you. Sorry. I... I don't make the rules, I just follow them. So you say a place up the road ten miles, right? What's the name? Look, we don't get much drifters around here. They know better. Go. Okay. Have a nice night. What the fuck? Hey, act cool. Hale, is that you? Turn off the fucking light. Hey, man, thought that was you. New car? Yeah, no, it's one of Amanda's friends. You know, we're borrowing it for a couple days. This thing's a fucking mess, though, we're just cleaning it out, you know? It's nice. So, how you been? - I've been good. - Yeah? Time off, new baby and all. Yeah, that's right, Ray said you had a kid. What are you gonna do? Back to the grind, right? Yup. - Business good? - No, business is shitty. You know, it's not exactly a tourist destination. You know, for most people, it's kind of last resort. It'll pick up, keep your head up. Hey, Mandy. You okay? Hey, don't fucking look at me, man. You know, bitches get in fights just like the rest of us. Okay, you two behave. - I'll see you later, Tony. - Yeah, see you later. Why don't you put on some fucking make-up, okay? You think I like looking at that fucking shit? I'm sorry. Tell Ray to get down here, all right? Shit's about to get messy. Love birds. - Adams. - Detective, good morning. Where are you? Down at the marina, checking out some beachfront property. - No action? - No, not yet. Look... What exactly am I looking for here? I mean, gimme something. Colonel Miller, a U.S. officer stationed in my country... we came to believe he came back here with an asset very crucial to our security. We need to speak to him about this asset. - And the girl? - Collateral. I don't get it. Why isn't the U.S. government on top of this thing? Oh, that is classified. Classified... well, can you declassify it for me? That is way above your pay grade, Detective. They don't pay me enough for anything around here. How will I know when we're getting close? When the shit hits the fan. People don't believe shit stink until they step in it. - This better be good, Mandy. - Come see for yourself. What the fuck? What's his story? Drifter Marine, we doped him up real good. Anybody see him? - No, but Officer Hale came... - What are you doin'? Move! - Come on, come on. Outside. - Jesus, Ray! Okay, what? Talk to me. Officer Hale came by, better go in, saw that guy's car. Officer Hale is a fucking Boy Scout. Let's just hope to hell he hasn't run those plates yet, because if he did, we're gonna have a lot more shit to worry about than those chinks and some dope. - When's the pick-up? - Tony says two days. That means we gotta get him out of here before, right? You put me in quite a predicament here, Tony. - Yeah, what the fuck can you do? - Maybe be a little more careful? Give me a smoke. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Look... - Lighter. I guess shit happens. So, tell me, when are we gonna get the money for the guns and do this whole Asian exchange. Tuesday at the latest. I tell you, them nips are gonna bring a pretty good price. - You want to try one of them out? - No, I'm good, Tony. Roll all in the hay as soon as I get done taking care of this fucking thing. Hey! Why don't you go find something the fuck to do! Come on, Tony, take it easy, will you? Come on. - She's sensitive like her mom, okay? - Her mom was a fucking whore. This is true. I never really did like that fucker anyways. Fuck her, though. There's plenty of fish in the sea. Family first, right? And don't you forget it, okay? Come here. Do me a favour. Get rid of this guy. Let me know when you do it, and I'll make sure everything's clear on my end, okay? Fuckin' A, I'll take care of it before lunch. Okay. I'm gonna enjoy it, too. Wake up, cowboy! Hey. GI Joe's up! Devil's work is never done. I went through your shit last night. You have a lot of military shit up in here. What, are you like an MP or something? A real bad ass? I don't give two shits who the fuck you are, 'cause I'm still gonna chop you up and feed you to the animals in the back woods. You know what really gets me? Really fucking gets me... is... in all that shit... there was this. A lipstick canister, and I'm like, why would he have a lipstick canister? Oh, maybe he's a homo. You know what? I'm gonna paint your lips, because you're a fucking homo. Except it ain't fucking lipstick, it's this. What the fuck is this? God, jeez... Oh, no, try the knots, man. Yeah, I'm an excellent knots tier. I was a Boy Scout. In fact, I got my knot-tying badge right here. Oh, you a tough motherfucker, ain't you? Wrong time, wrong place. Ain't your lucky day, shit happens! I mean, what... so you got $300, no phone, no ID, and in your trunk, no suitcase, just a bunch of clothes. And you still haven't fucking told me how you got Junior's car! Goddamn it! Answer him! Look, it ain't hard to tell that you're a fucking Marine, okay? But what gets me fucking rock hard, is this right here. Why the fuck do you have a Banco de "Mal-dives" card? - "Maldeeves". - What the fuck is a Maldives? You know what? Fuck you, whoever the fuck you are, you are fucking dead! - You got the wrong guy. - Yeah. I'm gonna find out what the fuck this is. You fuck with that, you inbred piece of shit, they'll fucking find you. Go and fucking get Junior, and tell him we found his car. And tell him to bring his fucking chainsaw, because as much as I love torturing a fool, I got too much shit to do. And put up the fucking no vacancy sign, okay? Go! Okay. And cover up that fucking eye! I fucking told you that already! Stupid fucking bitch. Hey, Cap. Look at you. You look good, honey. - Thank you. - Really, really well. Thank you. Is it the hair? Maybe the lifestyle suits you better. I like to think so. - I thought you quit. - Well, I did... for a day. Conrad? Soon. - What do you need done? - An exit. - You got it. - Here he is. Good morning, sorry I'm late. Thought you'd be earlier. - Who is this? - Detective Adams, LAPD. He seems to think I'm hiding an ex-boyfriend or something on the boat. - Just doing my job. - You have a warrant, Detective? No, I don't, but it's like that vampire rule, if you invite me on, it's legal. It's up to you, Cap. Well, make it quick. Me and this little lady have some catching up to do. - I'll be just a minute. - Help yourself. - You okay? - I'll be better in 24 hours. Hans! Hans! Hi, sorry to bother you, folks. Has either of you seen a little Rottweiler, - black fur, ugly little shit. - Sorry, no. - Yeah, Adams. - Hey, I got the results back. There were no fingerprints on that picture you gave me. And there's video showing Conrad using force on a man at a gas station. - Then he stole the man's car. - You gotta be kidding me. It's an '86 White Trans Am, I'll send you the plates. It's not adding up. I've been trying to figure this one out, too. You get a location? Yeah, I'll text you what I have. Be careful. It's my girlfriend's dog. Every day, it's the same shit. I put the dog on the leash, the dog gets off the leash. I have to find the dog, put the dog back on the leash. I'm sick of this shit. But the things you do for love, right? And that ass. Not the dog's ass, my girlfriend's ass. I'll walk a dog for that ass. Well, anyway, thanks... thanks a lot. You said Reyes Creek? - Thanks. - What's happening? It seems like your boyfriend went on a war path, stole a car, beat the shit out of some guy. They ran the plates, 30 miles outside of Reyes Creek. I'm coming with you. Maybe you can be a voice of reason. Hope you know what you're doing, kid. Shit. - This is Laura, leave a message. - Shit. Turn your phone on, L. Cleaner on your six. The guy looking for his fucking dog. There's no turning back now. Nowhere is safe. - There he is, there he is. - Fellas, not now. Give me the keys, motherfucker! I told you, not now. There's no turning back now, nowhere is safe. Don't worry, everything's gonna be okay, all right? Hey, I think Conrad will be happy to see you. Who was that on the phone? Sam, she wanted to have drinks tonight. - You young girls love to party. - Yeah. I don't fucking believe this. Because you're a dumb fuck, that's why. Oh, I'm gonna love slicing this bitch up. Karma sucks! My bitches do not leave me. - That right? - They're fucking mine! You don't have to be a part of this, Amanda. Sorry. Junior, you heard what Tony said, right? - You don't have to do what Tony says, okay? - Amanda does what she's told! Go, get the fuck out of here now! Bad idea, man. Motherfucker! Where are you going? You just killed my crew. Put the bag down. I should have done this the moment I laid eyes on you. Yeah, you should have. Where the fuck is the bank card? - Fuck you! - Fuck me? Last fucking chance. It's in the office! It's in the fucking office! Now that wasn't so fucking hard, was it? Now come on, let's go! Move! - Oh, God! - Hey, hey, how's this feel? No, no! Fucking shoot me! Get the fuck up! Get up! Get up! - Goddamn it! - Move! Move! Where is it? - Goddamn it! Fuck! - Where is it? Thank you. On your knees. On your fucking knees. Now! Let him go! Now! - Don't do this for him. - I'll fucking do it. He fucking beat you. He hurt you, just leave. - I can't. - Yeah, you can. It's over, you don't have to be afraid anymore. What are you waiting for? Shoot this piece of shit! You're worth more than this. What are you talking about? I give you everything! No... no, no, you don't. You treat me like shit. Goddamn it. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby, okay? But I love you! I can't... I can't do this anymore, I can't. - I can't! - You stupid, fucking cunt! No! You fucking piece of shit. Hey, hey, come on, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. - Don't hurt me, please. - I'm not here to hurt you. Turn around. Right here, this way. It's okay. - Here. - What for? For you... take it. It's okay, just get 'em out of here. Come on. It's okay, I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. Come on, turn around. Take it, share it. Thank you. Thank you. Get out of here. Fuck. Drop that fucking knife... now! Put your hands on your head and drop to your knees. - Drop to your knees. - You're making a mistake, Officer. - Shut your mouth! Hands behind your back. - You got the wrong man. I said, shut your mouth! Drop that fucking weapon! And you let Officer Hale go now! Do not fucking move. I've had a long fucking day. I do not want to hurt you. Deputy Chief over here is a part of all of this. - Shoot him! - Shut up and listen. Ray and Tony been selling drugs, guns and these poor girls over here. Look at them. Look at 'em! See how afraid they are of him? He's an officer of the law, now do the fucking math. It's over, Ray. This place is done. They're dead. Every one of them, do you understand me? Now drop your fucking weapon and let me leave. - That's never gonna happen. - I'm leaving now, Ray. So remember why you became a fucking cop. These girls are scared and afraid, they need your fucking help, so pretend like you fucking care! All eyes are on you, Ray. Lose the radio. Left hands, both of you, cuff 'em. You, too, Ray. Over here. Stay there, Ray. Take hold of the car right now. Both hands. On the floor. Over here. Over here! - Okay? - Do it. Oh, we're gonna get you, boy. No, you won't. I hope you're a good cop, because he's a fucking disgrace. Make him pay. It's not like that. Listen to me, it's not like that. It's crazy how you get 20 miles outside of LA and this whole town is like a desert. - Oh, nice car. - That's him. - What you talking about? - Step on the fucking gas! - Now. - Calm down, I'm doing 90. What the fuck is wrong with you, woman? Chase the fucking Audi now. - Are you out your fucking mind? - Do it, or I'll put a bullet in you. You're looking at ten years, pointing a gun at a cop, girl. - Detective Adams, move. - You know how to use that thing? Want to test me? You got a lot of explaining to do there. Reyes Creek, ten minutes. Copy that. You're on his tail now. There, you happy? I don't have time for this shit. What's he doing? - Tell me what the fuck is going on! - Move. Move! Put it in fucking drive! - Shit! - He got a gun! Shit! Get him! Come on! Call for back-up. Go! Never mind. Detective Adams, I need back-up. - Sorry, I need your car. - You can have the car. - Let's go. Move it! - Please don't hurt me. Shots fired! Wiley! Fuck! Pick-up order ready, hot plate. Take a seat, I'll be right with you, hon. Hey, brother. - You look like shit, Miller. - Thanks, man, I feel like it, too. I was about to leave, you know? I'm glad you didn't. - What the fuck happened? - You would not fucking believe it. You look like this, trying to keep a low profile? Something like that, man. I heard you got the heat on your six. - Them reds don't play nice. - Where did you hear? Last night, you don't have a whole lot of time. - Yeah, I know. - You're a crazy motherfucker, aren't you? You would fucking know. Smoke? Only chance I'm gonna have to get out of this thing. Start new, you know? - I gotta look after my family. - Family? You're kidding me, right? She's having a baby, my friend. Then we have to have a shot, for old time's sake. Sounds like a good idea. Babe. But just one, you bastard. I know you. I gotta be on a plane by sunset, okay? All right, copy that. Here we go. You okay? You look like you've had a rough day. - Just a little. - Can I get you anything? Do you have anything stronger than milkshake in the back? My friend over here needs a drink. Yeah, sure. I got a bottle of tequila in the back room. - I won't tell, if you don't. - Not a peep from me. - Are you new here? - Yeah, I just started a few days back. And I thought I knew all the hot asses around here. - Me, too. - I'll be right back. You never fucking change, do you? It'll kill you one day. What don't kill you makes you stronger, right? - That's what I heard. - You called my boy? Yeah. - He's holding the wire for me. - He'll do you right. No worries. You okay? Yeah. Hey, guess to us, no matter how far we run, we can never get away from what we've done. I know what I've done. I just want a piece of normal, you know? There is no normal for us. Well, we're gonna give it a shot. You're here, you're in one piece, you lucky son of a bitch. They don't know about her, do they? No. Here we are, fellas. - Oh, damn it, I'm sorry! - It's okay. It's okay. I got it. - I'll get you another shot. - Great, thanks. She's new? - Here's to new beginnings. - Let's hope so. - Fuck. - You are pretty banged up, aren't you? Yeah. - You should see the other guys. - I bet. You got the bank card? Right here. - Thanks, man, I just... - No, don't even say it. But what you did for us back then, not even in two fucking lifetimes can we even repay you. Now... get going and take care of your old lady. That's what it's all about, right? Yeah, it is. Take care, man. Later. What the fuck? Hey, I need some help! Turn around! Slowly. Target acquired. Drop the weapon. Set it on the table... now. The drink... You're good. Didn't see you coming. Most men don't. - How'd you find me? - Where's the asset? Not here. I saw him give you the envelope. Hand it over now. - There's no intel. You're gonna get hurt. - Doubt it. Do you even know why you're here? Why you're tracking me? Not my job to know, Mr. Miller. My job is this... Hold and detain. Don't even think about it. One more move, and I will put one in your leg and let you bleed out. - Really? - Yeah, really. See, I'm guessing you're here, Myron. Long time. Yeah. You're a hard man to follow. You left quite a mess at that hotel, didn't you? Yeah. He had it coming. I ran into your lovely lady on the way up here. She was with a detective. - You tell me you didn't fucking hurt her. - Of course not. She is having a little car trouble, though. I'm not a monster... I'm a soldier. You used to be one, until you went AWOL. - If that's what you want to call it. - That's what it is. Why? Because the government tells you so? Is that it? Because they always tell you the fucking truth? America, baby. After that Snowden shit, they're not fucking around. - You sure it's just the U.S. on this one? - Yeah, the Commies sold you out, too. - Asset? - He says he doesn't have it. Let's do this the easy way, yeah? We're both men of action. Lies do not become us, Conrad. Come on, man, you believe that? Lies are what we are, Myron. You're selling classified information to the Russians. Come on. I'm sure it pays well, but it's not exactly NATO friendly. Where the fuck did you think you were gonna go? Last time I checked we weren't in the business of friendly. You gave me nothing to work with. Myron... I just want out, man. That's it. You might want out one day. Myron, asset recovery, Conrad Miller is detained. Copy that. It's a kill order. Move! It's already over, Conrad. There's nowhere to go. Hold this position. I know you're out here, Conrad. Can we please get this over with? This hiding shit is beneath you. You're hit. I know you're hit. You're gonna bleed out. Conrad, come out! - I lost him. Anything there? - Nothing back here. He'll probably circle back there. He has no other place to go. If you do engage, put him down! - Stay sharp, I'm on my way. - Copy that. Shit! It's over. Let it go. Walk away. Jesus. I'm out. Me, too. Like that? So it would appear. You gave me nothing to work with. You okay? Bitch, I let you live. Now you're on the list. You never make it personal, you hear me? You like this? Give me your fucking hand. Now, listen to me. I see you or anyone... from the agency within 100 fucking miles of my family, I will find every one of you and kill you. You understand me? You got that? Motherfucker, that's my gun hand. Good to see you, baby. Yeah. Let's go. - You got the door, baby? - I got it, babe. Why didn't you kill him? It's different now. Inactive doesn't mean I lost my touch, baby. Copy that. The customer said he saw Conrad sitting in a corner booth with some Arab guy, but he passed out, no sign of 'em now. - One man, one man caused all this. - Let's try one man and one woman. Guess we had it wrong all along. It was always both of them. No loose ends. I'm sorry. We work for the same people. - It's above your position, Detective. - Excuse me? You should never have been put into this position. Had I known, I would never have allowed them to do this to you. Had you known what? All hell would break loose and dead bodies here over AWOL Marine? Look, as you should know by now, Conrad Miller is a double agent. Getting secrets and selling them to the old Cold War buyers. And the woman, Laura, what's her story? The real Laura Wilder died 15 years ago. KGB agent Yulovsky took over her identity. She is the asset that Conrad took from my country that we've been looking for. And I am bringing her back with me when I go back home. So this is some real KGB shit? Spy versus spy? You American people feel... better and more comfortable so that you can sleep, if you think this only happens in the movies. - So what's the end game here, Cushko? - End game? That's classified. Go home, take a hot shower, go to bed, go to sleep. - Tomorrow is another day. - Is that how you Russian boys do it? Say tomorrow will be a better day and drink your vodka? Lots and lots of vodka. - I can't say it's been a pleasure, man. - No shit. - You take care of yourself, Adams. - You do the same. Hey, Cushko... Laura... did you know she was pregnant? Let me ask you something, if it was your family, and their lives were being threatened, wouldn't you have done the same thing? How is your neck? - It's a little achy, but... - Achy? Well... Copy that. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm good. You need anything? Let's grab that dinner. - Mr. Miller. - Vladimir. - Good to see you. - Always. And you must be the lovely Mrs. Miller, nice to meet you. This is Natasha. - Should we get on with this? - Yes, you will see all is in order. Hey, baby. - Business is good? - Always. You? - Yeah, ups and downs. - So I see. - Baby? - We're good. Funny, for something so small, to cause so much trouble? It's always the way? We'll let you get back to your moment. - Be good. - Yeah, stay out of trouble. - We did it. - We did it. - New beginnings. - New beginnings. It's Myron, asset recovery. Target acquired.
