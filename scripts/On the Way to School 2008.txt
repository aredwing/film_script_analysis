Okay. Okay, mum. Good bye. - Hello? - Hello. - What are you up to, mum? Hey, get lost! There's nothing here. Nothing at all. Okay, I knew I was coming to a village. I knew I'd be sent to a village.

What did you request from, Chief? Like water? I don't have running water. It's my first time in the east so, everything is kind of strange. Why? Because I grew up in the west, in big apartment blocks. - I had everything I wanted on tap. - It'll be tough on you then. - Well, it's bound to be a bit tough. - You can't be without water. - If you'll excuse us now, teacher... - See you again. Nice to meet you. - You'll slowly get used to it. - I have already. Today's my eighth day. - Hopefully you'll get more used to it. - Hopefully. Have a good day! - Don't you know, Bedriye? - No. - Ceylan? Zlkf? Well, where do they live? Come on, let's go. Take me there. - Okay. - Let's go then. Zulkuf's house is over there. I think there is nobody at home. And sure enough there isn't. There is nobody at this house, too. There is no one at home. - So, do you know anyone else? What? - I have to go to pee. Go on then.

Sabri's collecting cow dung, too. - They're not here either, teacher. - They're not? Vehip, why didn't you come to school? - Do you know Turkish? - No. - Ask why he didn't come to school. I told them last night. - Why didn't you go to school? Why didn't you go to school? I'm not registered. He says he's not registered. I spoke with chief last night. It's not a problem. - I said he should come. - He says registration is not important.

How are you? I'm fine too, thanks. My name's Emre. And my surname's Aydn. I'm from Denizli, by the way. I've come here all the way from Denizli. I haven't taught before. This is my first year. And it turns out to be with you. This is my first year, as a teacher. Do any first-years know Turkish? Don't ask in Kurdish. Do you know Turkish? - What's your name? - Bahar. Say it yourself. Stand up and shout. - Bahar. - Bahar. Your name's Bahar. So, you know Turkish. Do you know Turkish, Bahar? "Er." No 'er'. It's 'yes', Okay? I don't want to hear 'er' at the class. All right?

Come here, boy. Are you Zlkf Yldrm? What's your name? What's your name? Is your name Zlkf? Speak. Is your name Zlkf? Kids, ask him a question. - Zilkif, he's asking your name. - Zilkif. There you go. Never mind. Okay. Go back to your place. Now what are we going to do, kids? Let's start today... ...by making our classroom rules. I don't want you to speak Kurdish in classroom. Why not? Because all our lessons are in Turkish. If you speak Kurdish, I won't understand you. Okay? So, let's not speak Kurdish in class. Let's try to speak in Turkish. Because you will stay eight years at school... ...and all lessons will be in Turkish. So, please don't speak in Kurdish at the classroom, okay? It's really exhausting, mum. Yes, they showed up. Not all of them but more than half of them came. It's hard dealing with all the kids at once. The first-year students came today. They can't speak Turkish. Whenever I say something it's like I'm wasting my time. They don't understand a word. How am I supposed to teach them? They just stare at me. They just sit there staring and they don't understand a thing. Damn it! The line's gone dead. Is this your first day? No, is this the first time you're coming to school? - Are you a first-year student, too? - Canan. Okay, Canan. Sit down. Nedret, look after her too. Teacher, I need a pencil sharpener... ...a rubber. - What's up now? - She wants to sharpen her pencil. - You want to sharpen your pencil? Okay, go on. Sharpen your pencil. - Sharpener. - A pencil sharpener. Here. Leave your notebook there. Do it over the rubbish bin. The rubbish bin. It's over there. Leave you notebook and go to the bin. Go to the bin. Go on. Canan. Come with me. Look, you have to sharpen it over the bin, okay? Go on then. Can't you do? Give it to me. I'll do it. - I need to pee. - I didn't hear. Shout. - Say it again. - I need to pee. - You should say "Can I go to the toilet"? - Can I go too-let? - Toilet. - Too-let? - Okay, you can go. Devran, come here. Here. Hold this. There. What's this? Others, be quiet. What's this? - What's this? - A horse. - What's this? - A cow. - Quiet! What's this? - A cow. No, it's not a cow. What's this? A bear. - A bear. - A bear! Okay, off you go. Zlkf, take off your bag. Take it off. Okay. Come here. What's this? Be quiet! - A butterfly. - What's this? - What's this? - A butterfly. In Turkish? - What is this? - Can I go to the toilet? What? No, you can't. What's this? A bee. - A bee. - A bee. - A bee. - Off you go. What is this? - Vehip, what's this? - What? - What is this? - An ear. - It's not an ear. - This is your ear. - What is this? This is your ear, isn't it? This is your ear. What is this?

You tell me. - A partridge. - What's this? - A partridge. - In Turkish. - A dog. What's this? What was this? - A duck. - It's not a duck. This is different. - Rojda, what's this? - A duck! Be quiet! Zlkf, what's this? - A watermelon. - It's not a watermelon. - A bird. - Right! Who said bird? - Well done! It's a bird. - A bird. - A bird. - A bird. Okay, your turn.

'Ker' means 'knife'. So it means 'knife', right? When you say 'kelepe' it means the same: Handcuffs. - What do you call this? - 'Tornavida'. Screwdriver. 'Tornavida'. So that's the same word too. See that string there? Let's wind that around here. - Is it long enough? - No. How are you doing? Here, it's coming. Thank God for that! Let's go backwards!

If I come over there, I'll show you hell! Don't hit me! Don't hit me! You want to be like neighbor's girl Aysel? Stop that! Stop! They can't hear you. Have you brought the key? So, this is the situation. My aim is just to teach them how to read and write this year. I mean, forget about mathmetics... ...social life information... ...and all the other stuff. I want to teach them at least Turkish so they can read and write. If they can gain that background... ...then next year I can make up for everything they miss this year. - It's a penalty! - It's a penalty! I'll be the goalkeeper. Turn around! Don't use your notebook reverse. Hold it in your hand. Look, just like this. Hold itjust like me. Hold it like this. Right, like this. Look at me. Look. Don't write. Hold it like this. Okay? Wait. Everyone, look at me. You will hold the pencil like this, okay? This is the pencil. Okay? Draw lines like this. Is it okay? Go on. Don't rub it out! Don't! Stop it! You should start from the first page. Take the pencil. Relax, relax. Continue. Continue until the end of the paper. Okay? Is it okay? Go on, do like this. That's correct. Don't go backwards. Keep going this way. Now, fourth-year students. You're also fourth-year students. - Third-year students! - Third year students, raise your fingers! - I'm a third-year student, too. - Copy down the Turkish Oath in your notebook and memorize it! - Go on. Do it. - I've finished. - What? I've finished. First-year students, draw those lines. Start from here. Move up the page, up! Come on, up! Well done. Now, come here. Draw this one.

You don't understand, do you? Yes, you don't understand. You don't know Turkish, is that right? You don't understand, do you? You just laugh. Well, I don't understand you, either. So what will we do now? Here, take this. Give me the other one. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - My life... - My life... ...is a gift...is a gift... ...to Turkey. ...to Turkey. - Happy is the one who says I'm Turk! - Happy is the one who says I'm Turk! - Study well in your classes! - Thanks!

Is there a parents' meeting tomorrow? A parents' meeting. Is tomorrow the 15th? Is it November the 15th? Thursday. Is tomorrow Thursday? Selam aleykum. First of all, I want to thank you all for showing up here. I don't know some of you but I'm the new teacher. My name's Emre Aydn. I'm from Denizli. I want to talk about the kids' general performance at the school. Most of the kids come here without their notebooks. For example, Ercan akmak. I think he's the driver's son. He's not here, is he? - No. His guardian's here. - Ercan comes to the school without a pencil or a notebook. He comes into class. I tell everyone... ...to get out their notebooks. They all take them out. I ask Ercan if he has a notebook. And he says 'na'. I guess 'na' means 'no'. 'Na'! It's not even Turkish. He says 'na'. But that's great, teacher. You're learning a new language here. They don't know a lot of Turkish. That's possible. But if you encourage them with their Turkish it'll help me a lot. Because whenever I speak the kids don't understand me. In Turkish classes, for example, I ask them to repeat a sentence. And they can't even do that. I mean, their Turkish is very weak. - Is it OK if I translate for these two ladies here? - Of course. Go ahead. We've put up with the kids for years. It's your turn now. What can we do? - Please, translate. - He wants us to send the kids to the school clean. Their clothes, uniform, pencils and notebooks should all be clean. And send them to school on time not at the crack of dawn. - The school has opening times. - What time should they come? - The school opens at 07.30 a.m. - At home... ...teach your kids to be quiet. Do you understand? Just keep trying. We trust you with our kids. Even if we are wrong, at the end you're the teacher. You know better. You're the one who does the teaching. - Forgive us, teacher if we're wrong. - Please, don't say such a thing! No, you don't have any fault. Let's see. Which one is better, mine or yours? - Let me write something, too. - Vehip, this is my notebook. This is better. Sharpen your pencil, then. Sharpen that pencil. Sharpen it. Go on. Sharpen it. Sharpen it. Go on. Sharpen it. What is this? Here it is. Keep this sharpener. Okay? - Mum, do you know what the teacher gave me? - What? - A green pencil sharpener. - Really? - Honestly. It's really sharp. I've got a pencil sharpener. Have you? - Are you going to eat something? - What is there? Molasses and eggs. I'll eat eggs. What are you up to? Fine. Taking it easy. I'm taking it easy. No. I'm a bit tired. I don't know. Moreover, today, this girl had this thing with her finger. It was like as if her finger will split off. A stone hit her. No, she's not from my school. The little girl of my neighbour. Gurbet's sister. Half of the girl's ring finger was actually missing. She was yelling and screaming. I poured hydrogen peroxide over it. I doused it in iodine to stop it getting infected. Melek, come here. Come here. Come on. Come here, come. - Does she know you? - Yes, she knows. Melek, does your finger hurt? Thanks for yesterday. I was so terrified. I don't know how I got there. I was sinking in the mud. My wife said you got stuck in the mud over there. Imagine this happened in winter. This is Emre. Give it to Emre. Teacher Emre. - Okay, okay. Bring it to me. - Give it to him, bring it. Give it to, Emre. Come on, my love. Give it to, teacher Emre. Bring me the empty plate! - I was on my way to Germany in 1992. - Have you been abroad? - I planned to go. - Yes. - My Turkish wasn't good at those times. I didn't know anything about politics or Turkish-Kurdish discrimination. We were going to go by ship. The company was sending me. We had an accountant named zlem. She gave me a form to fill in. You know how those forms ask you your mother's name, father's name? This one also asked how many languages you knew. I figured I knew two languages: Turkish and Kurdish. So I wrote two languages. zlem said she didn't know I knew two languages and asked what they were. I said I knew Turkish. She said she also know Turkish and asked what the other was. I said I know my mother tongue and I know Turkish. - She asked me what that was and I told her that its Kurdish. - Kurdish. She just burst out laughing. Like a whore, excuse me for saying so. She really laughed at me and mocked me. - You see, that's wrong. - She really mocked at me. She said to me "You count Kurdish as a language?" I said Turkish is my second language. I learned Turkish when I was fifteen. Doesn't that make it a second language? - Now, he speaks Kurdish... - Foreign language is something different. But these children! I mean, Heca and Servet are going to school, right? - Yes. - They learn a bit of Turkish from the television. Why do they go to school? - To learn Turkish. - So, what is Turkish to them? A foreign language. One they don't know. I accept that. My dear and valued teacher... ...our kids barely learn Turkish after five years. Rojda, come here. Come here! Why? - Write it. - Okay. Well done. It's wrong. Clean it. You wrote it wrong. Rub it all out. Look. Do it like this. Hasan, come here. Hurry up! Come on! Run! Run! Did you do this, Rojda? Did you write these?

Go on! Okay! Go outside! Get off! Get out! Okay, get out! Okay, get out! Get out! What are you up to, Mum? Nothing. I was in class. I sent the kids out to break. I don't know. I mean, things are all the same as ever here. I don't feel like calling. I don't speak to anyone, anyway. It's good. As usual. It's sunny. It is over! It is over! Shall we make an apple? What's this? This is grass. Okay? This is beautiful. You like it? Is it all right? Is it beautiful? Did you like it? Here you are, continue yourself.

Where can you buy chocolate? Vehip, where you can buy it? You don't know, isn't it? What language is this? What have you written here? What have you written here? What does that mean? Is this Turkish? What language is it? Is it Kurdish? What did I told you? Didn't I say told you not to make your homeworks in Kurdish? What did I told you? Are you doing this just to be stubborn? Go up to the blackboard. Go on! Stand on one foot when you get there. We're having a Turkish lesson and he writes Kurdish in the book! Okay. - That can't go there. - There! There! This is mine.
