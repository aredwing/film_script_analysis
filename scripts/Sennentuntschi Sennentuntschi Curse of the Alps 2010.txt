Go, have a look next to the fir trees. Thank you. - 18, 28, 38 and 48 are retained. - Ok. - So? - Adolescent male, dead about 30 years. - Have you found the boy? - No. And where's the girl? Do you recognize him? That one. - This one? - Dear God. That's Albert. That's not possible. This picture was taken in 1975, when the boy was reported missing. Are you telling me, your daughter saw a ghost? There was another cop up here who didn't believe in ghosts. Swiss Alps, 1975 Do you hear that? Jesus. Go, get Zingg. Broken neck. - Fortunately. - Why? Normally you're strangled if the drop isn't long enough. Strangulation is torturous. - So it's suicide. - Yes. Horrible. Why would such a god-fearing man do such a thing? It's... a dark force that crept into his heart. When he was at his weakest, the force took his soul. In our church we only have one name for this force: The devil. We won't bury Gian, servant of God and our sacristan, like a dog. Despite his grave offense against God's will, we will grant him peace in death for 3 days and his grave shall be next to the pilgrim's path. Let us pray. Reusch, look. Mother of God! Go, get the doctor! Quick! Is everything all right? She doesn't seem in such a bad state. I'm Doctor Zingg. And your name is? Reusch, go get a glass of water. - So? - Probably just a fainting spell. She probably got lost up there. Otherwise nothing's normal about her. This woman has amnesia. She doesn't speak. And it's not physical. You can't drink with a paralysed tongue. We should take her to Schopfmatt. We're not taking her to an insane asylum. She needs someone to take her home, not someone to give her electric shocks. Do you want to make a phone call? - I must go. I've given you my opinion. - Yes, and you know mine. It wasn't suicide. If Tnz saw the woman three days ago, the case is clear. Nothing's clear. Tonz saw a monk - on the pilgrims' path. - A monk? One who walks like a woman? How does a woman walk? Tonz? Yes. Show me. I... I'm not sure. She ran away the moment I saw her. "She"? - I mean the creature. - Right, A creature. A monk. I think this girl is one of those hippie chicks from the city who came up here and took too many drugs. Ah, bollocks! Good day! Theres, do you have a free room for her? No. Come with me. - Are you crazy? - Are you nuts? First the sacristan's suicide, then her. This is no coincidence. Sebastian, this woman was on Mt. Thistle. She dropped this. Albert carved it. And my brother's up there with him. You have to go to the cabin to see if everything's okay. Sebastian. Please. Do you have something for her to wear? There. Doesn't speak, but goes for the best. Thank you, Theres. What are you doing next? First, I have to go to Mt. Thistle. - And her? Will you take her with you? - No. She'll stay at my place since you haven't got - room for her. - You can't let her wander around. She may look like a doll. But there's no proof she didn't kill our sacristan. - Why do you think it's murder? - do you need to find Albert's and Erwin's dead bodies before you understand that she's a murderer. She either goes with you or you lock her up. Better safe than sorry. It won't take long. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Here. Mother of God. Is anyone here? Erwin! Get in touch. Reusch So? Everything's fine. They went hunting. The gun is gone, the cows are in the pasture, the fire is still glowing. They must have left at dawn. Thank God. What do you mean, "thank God"? Reusch, as long as you haven't seen Albert and Erwin, I can't rest. You can't take it so lightly. I am taking it seriously. - Let me see her. - What? - She's too dangerous for you. - Bollocks! She'll bewitch you. Don't look into her eyes. - You're scaring her. - No, not me. The crucifix. She's the devil. Out! Out! She'll kill you, Reusch! Out! Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Don't cry. Everything is fine. Yes, that's you. So we can find out who you are. This is you too. Maybe you can read or write. I just want to help you. Time to dream. Final Stop "Trepunt". Mister Manz? Martin Delacroix. Volunteer, Fribourg. Yes, right. Do you have good lungs? I think so. Let's go. I thought you had good lungs. City boy. Idiot. What makes a guy like you come up to the mountains? Done something wrong? I just wanted to leave the city. Leave the city or a woman? Both. I understand, a woman. Was there another man? No. So where's the problem? Our relationship was too exclusive for her. So she left. Without a trace. And now you think the mountains may help? Stop it, you idiot! Albert. Pleased to meet you. He is as mute as a maggot. Or a good woman. Wait! Take this. It's from Theres. Sit down. What's your thing in life? - I work in an ER. - Oh. - A doctor. - No, no. Assistant physician. Now you'll be assistant milker. Right, Albert? Fresh goat's milk. - Thank you. It's still warm. - Yep. Oh boy! A city stomach can't take it. It's not that funny. To the barn! Better? A little bit. Then go and assist Albert. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, um, that's me. Yes, that's Mount Thistle. Holzlistock, up there. Theres. You know her already. That night, it seemed as if she wanted me. But then she chose the mayor. Was Albert born mute? No, an avalanche in 1964. It buried my brother's farm. He was his only son. After digging for two hours we found him. He was the only survivor. He has never talked since then. Put it back into the tin. For God's sake! Idiot! That won't make it better. Or do you eat dirty cheese? City boy. What happened? I can't believe it. Clean it up. Son of a bitch. What's going on? Bloody lynx. I missed it. Nothing we can do about it now. Wait. It's the windpipe. The longer we wait, the more it suffers. Come. Come on. It's okay, boy. Thank you. Now we come to Missing Persons. You have to work your way through them. They are classified according to country and region. These are the most recent. If you can't find anything, you can always leave her here. Come. I want to show you something. Abracadabra! - Do you know what That is? - No. The quickest way to the stars. Absinth. The green fairy. Cheers. They say, it makes you go blind. But so far no one who has bought from me has complained. If anything, it makes you see things - that don't exist. - That's because of the thujone in it. - What's that? - A nerve poison. It's a hallucinogen. Therefore illegal. One guy killed his wife while he was high on it. Chopped her head off. With an axe. Well then, sant. Down with the cops! MISSING "Three men killed in a hunting-lodge fire. Unknown female, disappeared. St.Moritz, 1950. Investigating inspector, Reto Matter." That's not possible. Take five. - What's up? - I must talk to someone in the valley. Now what? I don't want to take her there. Could you take care of her until I get back? - Do you know what you're doing? - Yes. You're the mayor and the only one I trust. Ok then. Just because it's you. Thanks. He will come back. Girl, wait. Is everything okay? Everything's fine. Show me the picture. Kind of creepy. In 40 years of service, this is my only unsolved case. "Luegisland" (Scenic View). That was the name of the lodge. And this is how it looked after the fire. Do you know anything about this woman? Prime suspect. Probably a gypsy. Despite an intensive search, I never found the woman. Thank you very much. Inspector Matter. When I am at the Pearly Gates, I'll ask the Lord who the woman was. You do that. I'll call you if I have any questions. You do that. You made a hubby. Nice. It will get loud. Hey, are you crazy? - Let me! - What is going on? Where are you? Come out! Don't be scared! Here's to the top, and here's to the middle. To the middle... Here's to the top, and here's to the middle. Let's hope tonight we all get a little. Now it starts spinning, eh? Albert? Bring me a glass. Now you drink. - Don't be scared. - Soon you'll see another kind of fog. Come on. Come on. Be a man! One plus one equals? Three! My God. Sebastian? Are you hungry? Apple? Come. Eat. Eat. God bless this bread. Amen. Bread. Don't be scared. It's just a knife. What's the matter? He's going wild. Time to send him to a brothel. So he'll have problems with women for the rest of his life. Those problems only exist in the city. Free love! No wonder women don't know where they belong anymore. Whoopsy daisy! Are you already too drunk or getting philosophical? Sorry. Just the blues. Free love. That's what my girlfriend believed in. I don't. To forget one woman, you need another. - Up here? - Especially Up here. Right, Albert? You need a "Sennentuntschi". A what? A "Sennentuntschi". Albert will make you one. Go! Get the broom. Hurry up! Notter! Notter! Notter! Where is she? Notter! Where is she? - Where? - Salis chased her away. - Salis? - Yes. I thought you were my friend. I never blamed you for marrying Theres. - Even if you are not half the man I am. - Reusch! The baby is dead. Two months early. I couldn't do anything. She wants to see you. She's to blame, Sebastian. The woman took my child. I just wanted to help. Theres... How could you let that happen? Notter, I... I'm so sorry, - I... - Fuck off! Damn it! It's a true legend. Three herdsmen in the alps. Lost and lonely. Like us. Use a broom, straw and a rag to create the woman of their dreams. The devil took pity on them and made her come alive. That's the Sennentuntschi. Does the housework, irons, does laundry, makes coffee, and at night she lets the three men have their way. And? Happy? Happy. Now we'll make this caterpillar become a butterfly. A real woman, you understand? Got it. I'll go get Dr. Frankenstein. Not like that. With a saying, idiot. Let's hear it. Spiritus sanctus, Abracadabra! What's so funny? Up here, I'm the boss! All together now: Absinthus, Spiritus sanctus, Abracadabra! Dear Theres, dear Jakob, we all know who's responsible for this innocent child's death. And it's not the first time this woman has killed. The first written record of this woman dates from 1340. Eight dead monks in Piedmont. And there was more. Four merchants in Bohemia, murdered in 1435. In 1656, five soldiers slain Alaska, 16 gold miners. five missionaries in Eschnapur. We have reports, pictures, even... photographs. St. Moritz, 1950: the last instance. And now... this. She's back. You all know this face. But those who didn't know it had to endure a horrible death. Calm down. This book was written by the Irish monk Collum. He defeated her. God gave him the weapon to send the devil to where he belongs: to hell. This is the symbol that makes the devil weak. Draw it on your door frame. And he will avoid your home. Anyone who sees that woman should come to me. The crucifix gives me the power to save our souls. Even yours, Reusch. Amen. What's going on? Are you nuts? I can't believe it. Martin! - Are you crazy? - What's that? Damn. Something to eat. Take care of her. Erwin, it wasn't the Absinth. This woman is real. More real isn't possible. And how did she get up here? With bare feet? - And in our doll's clothes? - I wonder too. What now? She's the Sennentuntschi. - No bad jokes about that. - "Bad"? What do you mean? I didn't tell you the ending. Tell me. After the three have had their fun, she kills them in revenge. She skins them and makes dolls out of them. And you believe in this? You never know. Come on, you know her. I nearly fell for it. Oh Erwin. You do this with every volunteer? No, I've never seen her before. - Don't mess me around. - I'm not. I swear. Now what? What shall we do? What do I know. First I have to bone the goat. And then we'll see. I'm Martin. You? My name is Martin. This is Albert. Albert, give her some shoes. A child of nature, eh? Martin, come help me. Stop joking around. I'm sure she's missing. I wouldn't mind if she'd stay a little. You have to bring her to the village. I don't have to do anything. Do you want 50 cops to come up here, looking for her and find your distillery? Hello?! All right, I'll take her down. But you two finish this. - Sure. Tell me what to do. - Put the remains under the manure. Albert will show you the rest. Albert! Shall we? Let's have something warm for the road. Coffee. Warm, good. I'll show you how it's done. Matches! Abracadabra! There, there don't cry... The most important part is missing. Yes? Inspector Matter, I have another question. My name is not Matter, my name is Huber. Mister Matter's dead. Heart attack. Have a good day. You too. WANTED FOR WOMAN'S MURDER Sit down. Coffee is ready. Yes, sit down. Why are you still here? Don't you see? She doesn't want to go. I tried everything. In that case, I'll take her to the village. Go ahead and try. But today she stays here. There's a storm approaching and you don't want a mudslide taking you to the village. A mudslide. These city dwellers have no patience. Meat. I'll be back. Come with me. Come, come. Where are you? Are we playing hide and seek? Martin? Albert? Did you see Martin? And the woman? This bloody moron. Get the gun and wait here. If you see them, shoot in the air. Understand? I don't want you up here. Understand? You don't seem to understand anything. Never mind. I'll show you the quickest way down. There. You go straight down to the village. Come here! Not that way! Come back! I can't believe this. Come here! Now, where were we, you and me? What are you doing? Damn. Are you crazy? Inside! Give me that fucking gun. Stay there. What was that all about? I was looking for you. Why does Albert have a weapon? - Where is he? - Inside. With her. I thought you wanted to take her down. You feel guilty, don't you? She could talk about what happened if she was able to speak, eh? What, eh? Did you do it or not? She wanted it. Oh, I see... And now you? Yes. What, yes? Yes, I did her too. She's leaving tomorrow. Friends? Don't know. Let's just say we nailed the same woman. - We Have competition. - That's ok. After all, it's his first woman. As it is for you. Hey! She's not my first. But who would have wanted you? A real beauty. You wouldn't believe it. Marlies. But I moved too fast. How do you mean? At the village fair. Behind the church. I thought she liked it. Two months later she married my brother. And seven months later Albert was born. No, I can't believe this. Yep. His mother never talked to me. Never even looked at me. Does he know? No. For God's sake! Do something! - Let him be happy in his own way. - That's no way to treat a lady. If you have a nail, you have to drive it home. Show this floozy that you're a man. This is how we do it. Now sing her a song. In tongue. Even you can do it. This is how we do sex education up here. Enough foreplay. Get down to business. Now you know how to continue. Oh no. Already blew his load. Take it easy, Albert. Well yes. It's healthy. There's enough room for two. Free love, Erwin. Did she bite you? She's a wild one. I'll teach you! Everything's fine. I'll bring you to safety. They're coming. Quick. She can't be far away. Come on, come on, come on! Reusch! - Where is she? - Gone. You helped that bitch escape. The one who killed my child! Do you know why you're the best cop Trepunt ever had? Because you're not the brightest. If you don't shut up until I fire you, we'll burn you with that witch. Let's go. Something's wrong with her. Come on. Oh my God. I'll kill her! Come on! It's ok. Come. Trust me. You can't stay here. If Erwin finds you, he'll kill you. Do you understand? I'll take you to the village. From there we can cross the border. We have to get away. I'm sorry about yesterday. I'll be back. Give it to me! There. She won't get in there. - Were have you been? - I followed her, nearly had her. - Where? Up there. You two bury the goats, then wait in the cabin until I get back. Bury? This lot is rotten. Understand? Hey, where's Martin? Why? What's going on? Come on! What's going on? Blood poisoning. It's getting worse and worse. Go get some penicillin, please. - No, I'll take you to the village. - No, I can't. Martin, what's wrong? The police are looking for me. I can't go to the village. Why? She didn't run away, my girlfriend. She did have another guy. And I couldn't let her go. Are you telling me that... Yes. I stabbed her to death. I'm so sorry. Stop it. I deserve this. What do you deserve? To die up here. Bollocks. You're just a jealous man. I invited the devil into my house. Albert, go get some Absinth! Don't ask, go! I'll get you to bed. What's the boy doing? Albert! I found her! Now you can play hide and seek. Take this! And another one! Burn you bloody witch! Albert. Hang in there. Yes, breathe. Breathe slowly. Da... ddy. Yes, daddy. Stay with daddy. Stay! Come. You... Devil! What now? And now you go back to hell. Reusch? I'm listening. Bless me, father, for I have sinned. I thought I was doing good for this community. But I was too stupid to see what's really going on within our village. Now let's talk about your sins, father. I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm arresting you for assault, deprivation of liberty and murder. Get out. If I were you I'd enjoy my last few steps as a free man. Afterwards you can sit until you rot. Sit down! Now I know why this woman resembles our woman. She's her mother. And you got her pregnant. As that wouldn't look good for a Catholic priest, you went up there and set the cabin on fire. Alas, she escaped. Loyal, innocent men burned to death. Because of you! I don't know how you were able to get hold of this girl. But you were certainly not the father she needed. You kept her in this hole! What? The sacristan had to feed her. But you never took care of this poor creature. And exactly six days ago, she escaped. She probably ambushed him when he forgot to close the trap-door for the first time. When he didn't come back, you went looking for him and found him dead, with a broken neck. And what did you do? You made it look like suicide to cover your crime. You set the cabin on fire! You killed the mother of your child. Reusch... she's not human. She certainly is. As was her mother. Her corpse was never found. Because there is no corpse. Reusch. Bibi, what are you doing? I saw her. Where? - On the path to Mt. Thistle. - Up or down? - Up. - Well done, Bibi. Erwin... Die! Who do you think you are? Burn! Burn! Now you can look God in the eye. No! What do you mean, "no"? She's the devil! No, she's not. Untie her. Don't you see, Martin? No woman will die in my presence again. Never again. Take that down. You're not a man. Hello? For fuck's sake! Fuck! Are you crazy? Untie her! Now! Get a knife. Slowly! Slowly. Now put the knife on the floor. On the floor! Come to me. Come! Erwin. Thank you. With this? Albert did this? Is he in there? Albert? Six days ago she was able to escape. Penicillin. I need penicillin. In the village. Go get it. After the three have had their fun, she kills them in revenge. She skins them and makes dolls out of them. Go away! Away! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Idiot! They found him in the creek. A terrible storm raged that day. Thunder and lightning, the mountain came down. The next day, they went up. There was nothing left standing. What an ending. Mummy, look! Sennentuntschi! For the love of God. This is not real!
