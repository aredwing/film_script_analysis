Driver: I think Jesse's crew is still out there. Worker: All right, thanks. - See you guys Monday. - Driver: Later. (men chatter to each other) - Jesse, come in, over. -(static) What, are you guys going for a record, out there? (static) Come on, Jesse, it's starting to snow. (static) Worker: (radio) Look, don't think for a second I won't hesitate to lock you guys in for the weekend. Stop screwing around, Jesse, you guys aren't getting overtime for this. garbled static: Help, help, help. Damn it. (ominous music) Are you kidding? Jesse! Come on, you guys. This isn't funny. Guys? (static) - Jesse? -(static) - Is that you? -(static) God! (blood drips) -(worker pants) -(heavy footsteps approach) -(footsteps approach quickly) -(worker yells) -(glass shatters) -(worker shouts) -(creature snarls) -(blood splashes) (eerie music) Sheriff: I don't know. I'm not seeing any tire tracks, Ron. A truck woulda left some. I had 23 horses yesterday, I got 22 today. I'm no sheriff, but best I figure that means one's missing. The gate's kinda low over here. Could it've jumped over? Ron: Been raising horses on this land for 35 years. Never seen one jump loose without taking a section of fence with 'em. Just seems odd to me that someone would go through all the trouble to steal one horse. Take two men and a trailer. Gates were closed? And tied. I'm not an idiot. So that's it? I'm just out one expensive animal? I wish I could do more for you, Ron, but... I'm just not seeing anything, here. I'm seeing one missing horse! Number 88. Last night all my horses wore numbered bridles, like this one, and this morning I'm missing number 88. Number 88. I'll keep an eye out. Ron: I lose another horse, you and I are gonna have a real problem. I wouldn't have it any other way, Ron. (door slams) He definitely left that gate open. Yep. (engine starts) Careful, now. The old bastard shot at the last guy she dated. (Donny laughs) (Adam plays piano) -(car horn honks) - Dad's here! Hey, Dad. What's up, buddy? How are ya? Adam! Adam, wait. - Paul. -(Paul sighs) He forgot his homework. Multiplication. So New York's a big city, right? Yeah, it's pretty big. So Why'd you leave? It was too big. Too noisy. Your, urn, your mom's car's gone? Yeah, she went to Florida on one of those Senior bus trips. She was excited. Adam's teacher wants to have a conference with us next week. She said they're on break, so they can plan around your schedule. Sure. Susan: Paul, I, uh... I've been talking to someone. It's really helped me. If you ever wanted to go together-- I'm not the one that left, Susan. -(car doors slam) -(engine starts) -(silverware clanks) -(food sizzles) Paul: Ah, all right. Whoop. That's too much. (chuckles self-consciously) There we go, I'm just gonna... Rub that off like that. There you are. When can Mom come home? That's a tough question, bud. Your mom decided to go stay with Grandma on her own. She can come home whenever she wants. But she says you don't want her to. Well, I think what she meant was, um... That we both have things to figure out. Is it because of Tim? No, it's not because of that. You understand? Yeah, okay. Okay. Are you all right? Someone's in the back yard. Where? In the trees. - Adam, come on. - Adam: Really. There's no one back here, Adam. Adam: I swear! You want me to go check? Take your gun. I don't need my gun. Look, I'm gonna go back there and I'm gonna prove to you that there's nothing to be scared of, yeah? You eat up and stay here. -(branches rustle) -(eerie clicking) Anyone out there? This is Sheriff Shields. Paul: You're not in any trouble. Just show yourself. (eerie clicking) (wind blows) (twig snaps) -(branches rustle) -(eerie clicking) (sighs) -(knocking at door) - Donny: Hello? Can I come in? Hey, boss. Hey, boss, you okay? The door was unlocked, so I just... I'm just fixing breakfast, here. Paul: Sorta. Susan buy him that cereal? It's got fruit in it. I don't think it counts if it's made outta marshmallows. Is Adam still asleep? Yeah. Have you been outside? Come on. What is this? I don't know. I woke up an hour ago and saw 'em. They look like hoof prints from a horse. It's hard to tell, but... - Paul: Spacing's wrong. - Donny: Yeah. One in front of the other. Like it's on two legs? How's that even possible? They were looking in our windows. A lot of houses near my apartment have the same thing. They go all the way to your apartment? They go all the way through town. Come on. Donny: Yeah, it turned off. Going that way. Probably just some punk kids playing a prank, huh? Donny: Yeah, why would they come out this far? Maybe it's an animal? Could be injured. Paul: I don't know. Whatever it is, it could still be out there, come on. Turned this way. Donny: Yeah. Paul: It sped up, here. Donny: Huh? The tracks are getting further apart. (fallen leaves rustle) Hey boss. Donny: Better take a look at this. Donny: They're gone. They stop here, and they just disappear. Paul: It looked like hooves. Some are bigger than a horse's, but, um... on two legs like a person or a bear. Okay, we're aware of it, we're taking care of the situation, okay? Thank you. How can I help you? Yeah, (sighs) it does sound like a prank, I... I'm just trying to be thorough. Listen, nothing else has been reported in the area. Paul: Yeah. I agree that it's nuts, yes. Yes, but I... I'd appreciate it if you kept an eye out, as well. This thing's got people spooked, and... A little bit of an explanation would go a long way. Paul: Yeah. I appreciate it. Thanks. Well, Forest Department says that they've never heard of an animal that could walk that far on its hind legs. Guy laughed at me. You know, the people are getting panicky. I don't know how long we can keep spinning this. Yeah, whoever did this has got a lot to answer for. You still think it's a person? I mean, those tracks, they disappeared into thin air. How is a person gonna make three miles of tracks without any other traces? Donny: Doesn't make any sense. Ah, don't let it get to you, Donny. That's exactly what whoever did this wants. Hopefully this just all blows over. Yeah. You finish up the paperwork on my desk? Yeah, you got it, boss. Paul: Thanks. Priest: Paul! How are you doing this morning? I'm good, yourself? Quite a little mystery we seem to have woken up to. Well, nothing mysterious about a good prank. Can I do something for you? Oh, Jonah, my black lab ran off last night. And it seems I'm not the only one missing a pet. I'll do what I can to find him. Priest: I really appreciate it. - Paul: 'Kay. - Priest: Very odd, animals acting up the same night as this little incident, yes? Yes. Yes, it is. Seen a fair amount of Susan in church, lately. I haven't seen you in some time. Priest: There is no weakness in mourning, Paul. Accidents happen. Turning to something outside ourselves, every once in awhile? That just shows wisdom in knowing where to find strength. The church and I are here when you need us. Thank you, Father. Priest: Oh, and, uh... People may seem a little nervous, right now. But they'll follow you to the ends of the earth. Just let them know you're leading them in the right direction. Thanks. (phone rings in the distance) (phone rings in the distance) ls everyone all right? What's going on, Sheriff? I'm trying to figure that out. My dad's got some pretty crazy ideas about it. Yeah, for once that old nut bag might be right. I bet it's got something to do with those stories my grandpa used to tell me. About something living in those woods. It doesn't. Well, what are we supposed to do about it? You don't have to do anything, all right, we're... We're working on it. Jim: Oh, is that right? Then tell me, why aren't you out there right now hunting that thing down? 'Cause it pays to think before you act, Jim. Claire: Well, what if it comes back? There is no "it", okay? There is no "it". Forest Department said this morning that there's no animal that leaves tracks like the ones that we found. Okay, so that tells me that we're dealing with a creative prankster who's heard all the great ghost stories that our buddy Jim, here, has heard. Well, maybe it's that new deputy of yours. Hm? Jim: City guy, thinkin' it's funny to stir things up? That's enough. Sheriff! How's it going, Sheriff? Oh, she's going, Earl. You? Good. You been out in the woods, lately? Into the trees? Yeah. Donny and I went pretty deep this morning. It's deer season. But in the last week I haven't seen so much as one deer within five miles of this town. Never seen nothing like it. All the animals just up and vanished. Huh. What do you think would cause something like that? It's hard to say. But... an animal senses a threat, they tend not to hang around. A threat. So you think an animal left those tracks? They don't look like any animal tracks I've ever seen. You take it easy, now, Sheriff. Remember, we're all still prayin' for ya. Thanks. - Susan: Hey. - Paul: Hey. Susan: Thanks for taking him, tonight, I forgot I volunteered at the church. No problem. I took him to the park today. The kids there were saying it's the devil, all this stuff going on. Did it scare him? Yeah. It's been six months, Paul. I need to know where you are. Susan: Because it's not fair. It's not fair to us, and it's not fair to Adam. Where are you? I don't know. I'll get him, it'll be just a minute. -(low hum) -(car tires crunch on dirt) Adam: Stop! What? There's something out there. Enough. Last night was one thing, buddy, but-- Dad, look! Look! Adam: Did you see it? You stay here. Lock the doors. (doors lock) (branches rustle) Hey... (dramatic music) (wood creaks) Come out, now, before you get yourself into more trouble! (metal jingles) (metal tags jingle) Paul: Adam... Adam! Adam! (breathes shakily) Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam: Dad? Are you hurt? I heard something outside the car and I got scared. I'm never gonna let anything happen to you. Do you understand that? (sighs) - Earl: Here you go. - Bar Patron: Thanks, Earl. You drinking to remember, or are you drinking to forget? I'll take another and see where it leads. How's it going with Sheriff Sheilds? He's a good man. Yeah. So how you likin' it? The town, not my booze, I know my booze is good. It's different. - Good kinda different. - Hmm. Lot of excitement, tracks in the snow. Hmm. How much you know about this place? And them woods? Yeah, my grandma, she was full blood Shawnee. Used to tell stories passed down by our people for generations. Oh, yeah? Stories? Mmhmm, about them woods. And what lived out there. The spirits that roamed in the trees. See they, they say when the white man came here, he didn't respect the land, or the spirits. So they came after 'em. Men, women, the children. Do you, uh... Do you believe the stories? Well, when I was young, there was a boy went missing up in them woods. They searched. When they found him, his body was 30 feet up a tree. So let's just say, I believe it enough to keep my door locked. You be careful, now, Deputy. Wouldn't wanna find you up a tree. Claire: Hey, Earl. Earl: Hello, ladies. What'll it be? (Claire gives order quietly) I'm a little confused as to why we're here. When children pick up a new word, they tend to say it constantly. It only gets worse when they learn we don't want them to say that word. Did Adam say something offensive? Mr. and Mrs. Shields... Pecker? (laughs) - Paul: We're sorry. - Susan: Sorry. About a week ago Adam called another child a pecker, and since then all the children have been saying it. - We can't get them to stop. -(Susan and Paul laugh) But as I can see, apparently, some people don't view this as quite the serious matter that it is. We do, we do, I... We're sorry, we'll talk to him. It won't happen again. There is one other thing. What's that? When he refers to Tim, he always seems to use the present tense. Teacher: "Tim is, Tim can." ls there something wrong with that? Teacher: Referring to someone who is deceased in such a way just seems unhealthy. I don't see how that's a problem. More times than not, when parents separate it's the children that get-- Tim is his brother. My child can refer to his brother however the hell he chooses. Teacher: I beg your pard-- Susan: And you are not gonna tell us how to raise our son. Do you understand me? Mrs. Shields, I-- Do you understand me? (sobs) Donny: Hey. I called you, before. Is everything all right? Yeah. I was just calling to check in. I was... It's none of my business. -(rumble) -(birds tweeting agitatedly) You hear that? (rumble grows) What the hell is going on? (wings flap rapidly) Thank you. I've never seen anything like that. Earl Everheart... He came up to me the other day. He said all the wildlife's gone. Paul: Those birds were leaving. It's closer to spring than fall, they... They're supposed to be flying north. And they were going south. Did he mention any of his theories about what he thinks might be going on? I was at his bar last night, he had some pretty crazy ideas. Those are just stories, Donny. Paul: And people have been telling them around here for a long time. Earl was just having fun with you. But what if they're not? Donny: What if there's something wrong about these woods? He said something about his Indian ancestors, they knew about a creature-- He's about as Indian as you or I. You really think there's a monster in the woods, Donny? No. Okay. But... These stories, they just sounded a lot like what's been going on. Donny: I don't know. And then he mentioned something about a boy. -(Paul sighs) - Donny: He was out in the woods a few years ago, and then he went missing. They couldn't find him until they-- They found a body up in the tree. Right. That boy was murdered, Donny. No monsters needed. Bad things happen, 'cause people let them happen. Paul: Somebody's always responsible, Donny. (tag jingles) (Paul sighs) (engine starts) Donny: Yeah, all good. Susan: Thank you so much, Donny. Yeah, my pleasure. Actually, my dad was a mechanic. I always thought I was gonna end up being one. Why didn't you? After my mom left us, uh... I spent so much time in the police station bailing my dad out. Just, uh, figured I may as well become a cop. Has he told you? About Tim? Susan: I had taken Adam to a friend's, and Paul was watching Tim. We had one of those kiddy pools. They think he slipped and hit his head on the bottom. I'm sorry. Susan: I don't blame him, you know. It was an accident. It wasn't his fault, it could've so easily been me. The problem is, he blames himself. He doesn't think he deserves what he has, but he does. It's hard to make somebody see in themselves what you see in them. (sighs) (eerie music) (cell phone rings and vibrates) (engine roars) - Ron: I told you-- -(wheels crunch over gravel) Claire: I don't want you to get yourself shot! Ron: I'm gonna handle this right now, myself! I'm gonna handle this myself, right now. -(Paul murmurs) - Claire: Calm down, Dad. Listen to the sheriff. Hey, calm down. Claire said that you think something's still bothering your horses, that right? Past few days, the horses have been real uneasy. Jumping around in the stalls. But for the life of me, I couldn't figure out what it was. Till last night. What happened last night? 'Bout 3 o'clock I hear someone bangin' on the side of the barn. Beatin' the living hell out of it. - So tonight I'm ready for him. - Claire: Dad! Ron: Now, get outta my way! Paul: Hey, hey, hey. Now, what if it's... What if it's one of the neighbor's boys just playing around? Paul: Come on, gimme this. Come on. Come on. Good. (horse whinnies) Those horses-- Are your livelihood, I know. Paul: I know, Ron. Now look, if you hear anything coming from that barn, you call me at home and I'll come over. We'll take care of this the right way. - Ron: Yeah. -(horse whinnies) Good. There they are! - Stand back. -(horses squeal) Donny: Get back. (horses whinny and kick at barn walls) Donny? Yeah, boss? You make sure that Ron and his shotgun stay here. -(horses whinny) -(bang from the barn) -(knocking from the barn) -(horses whinny) Hey! - Paul: Hey! - Get in, get in. - Paul: Hey! - Boss! Donny: You okay? What was it? I don't know. It's too dark. (horse whinnies) Come back in the morning. Paul: Assuming that this wall wasn't like this before last night? - Ron: No. - Donny: Look at the mud. Ron: I shoed all the horses last week. And these tracks ain't got any shoes. And look at this. The size is right for horse tracks, the two cloven halves are the same, but this right here? This ridge ain't normal. It's like the hoof is divided into three narrow pieces. A hoof divided into three parts. What purpose would that serve? I haven't got the faintest idea, Sheriff. Ron: Before right now, I didn't know prints like these even existed. Radio: A storm system is making its way into the area. Voluntary evacuation protocol will be in effect for Maiden Woods, Smith, and Knobb's Run. In other news, zoologists from the State University are baffled by the sudden and unexplained migration of wildlife from the northeastern forest surrounding Tanner. Hunters looking to end the season on a high note seem out of luck this year. (telephone rings) (answering machine beeps) Paul: (phone) Sheriff, this is Paul Shields from Maiden Woods County. Call me back when you get a chance. I wanna check with you and your men up in Tanner about something. I'm working a theory and I got some questions. Hoping you can help. (cafe customers chatter) (silverware clinks) Man: Hey, Sheriff. Mom? When are we going home? Right after lunch. I do have to run by the store first, though. I meant home with Dad? Sweetie, let's not talk about that right now, okay? Why not? - Adam... - Just eat your food. Adam: I don't want everyone to be sad, any more. Who's sad? I see you crying sometimes. You always pretend like you weren't, but I see you. Do you guys still love each other? Adam, I don't think that this is the place-- Yes. But sometimes it's a little harder than that, buddy. Radio: In local weather news, the storm front continues to make headway and should be in our neck of the woods in 24 hours. -(bell rings) - Local residents have already begun evacuation procedures. While not mandatory, the Ranger Service does recommend people take such precautions, as roadways will be closed, and access to remote areas Claire: You lost? Radio". will be intermittent over the course of the storm. Oh. Coffee. It's up front by the squirrel. (Donny laughs) So is it true? You're from New York City? Ah, yeah. I've always wanted to go there and ride the subway. Most people wanna go see the Statue of Liberty. Well, I'm not most people. The subway's not really that great. It's full of bums and pickpockets. (Claire laughs) Well, no wonder you left. So Why'd you come here? Oh, you know, just... Change of pace. Well, normally I'd say this town's pace-deprived, but lately... Yeah, yeah, it's not exactly what I expected. So you'll be leaving us, then? Nah, I just found the coffee. Who knows what I'll find tomorrow? (suspenseful music) (engine dies) Paul: Hey, Donny, is your radio on? Yeah, boss. Paul: (radio) Need to clear a deer from the highway at marker five. We'll have to come pick it up tomorrow, some time. Maybe it died of loneliness. (Paul chuckles briefly) -(leaves rustle quickly) -(Paul gasps) -(branches crunch) -(eerie clicking) (radio static) -(rustling) -(creature snarls) (Paul grunts) (footsteps rapidly run away) -(computer beeps) -(quick rumble) -(keys jingle) -(engine starts) -(crunching) -(eerie chattering) - Earl: Here you go. - Donny: Thanks. Earl: What can I get for you, Stu? Donny: Hey. You take care of that deer? Let's find somewhere to talk. Paul: I think we're thinking about this the wrong way. I think that deer was all... Who knows? Other deer were gone, that one wasn't. It looked older. Maybe it couldn't keep up, maybe all the other ones left it behind, I'm not really sure. Hey, you're losing me, boss. Ron Jenkins' missing horse. We thought Ron left the gate open. Yeah. I no longer think that's right. 'Kay. The claw marks. First I thought it was coincidence, or part of a well-thought-out prank. Deep cuts on the tree in the forest. I mean, it meant nothing to me at the time. Just now, that dead deer on the road... It had four razor sharp cuts right through its body. Same ones? Same size. Those stories you heard... I'm not saying that they're all accurate, but... I think we might be dealing with something that's not easily explained. A few years ago I saw on TV, they caught this giant fish off the coast of Taiwan or somewhere. They thought that this thing had been extinct for like, millions of years. Then, barn, there it is. Right under our noses the whole time. Swimming around in the ocean. So what I'm saying is, maybe... Maybe this thing that we're looking for, maybe it's always been here. And we're just now noticing it. So why now? Oh. Sheriff Paul Shields. You boys any closer to finding out what's running around in them woods? You know, I don't normally see you in this, this fine establishment. 'Course, I see your deputy in here enough to lower my confidence. - Can I hit him? - No. Everyone around here trusts you. I can't figure out why. Man can't even protect his own family. Now, can I hit him? I'm still deciding. Jim: You boys have a good evening. We got the utmost faith in ya. (Jim laughs) Jim: Go get me a beer, dude! Paul: Let's go. (branches rustle violently) I think it was a bear. That fast? Shh. (creature snarls) (branches rustle) (creature snarls) -(gunshot bangs) -(man yells) You know, it's kinda funny you never asked me. What you shoulda asked me in our interview. You know, why a guy from New York would come out here to basically the middle of nowhere. You got shot, Donny. Paul: That's reason enough for me. I know what it's like, to uh... Have people always telling you that it wasn't your fault. I don't need to know anything else. Donny: Do you ever pray? I mean, I never used to pray. But... When I was on that gurney, and they told me that my father died... You know, things had been going so well for me. I was moving up in the force, I had a nice girl. Ever since then, I've been asking God why. But, uh, now I think maybe I know why. Maybe I wasn't where I was supposed to be. (Paul sighs) Is this where you're supposed to be, Donny? Paul: Is this where God told you to be? We all have a purpose. Ours is to protect people. Maybe there's somebody here I'm supposed to protect. There you go. Or maybe you're supposed to protect me. (engine shuts off) (twig snaps) (branches rustle) (eerie clicking) (child's muffled laughter echoes) Tim? Please! It's after me. It's in the woods, behind me. Please! (man pants for breath) We'd been hunting for a few hours. Hunter: Hadn't seen anything. And then we came upon something. And we started tracking it. It had to be a deer. We thought somehow it just wandered right past us. Then what happened? It was fast, so fast. Hunter: It got Manny, first. Then Ryan, he was screaming in pain. Did you see it? I don't know what I saw. We'll start searching for 'em. Hunter: Don't bother. They're already dead. Paul: Assuming that there is some sort of animal in these woods that's never been discovered, how could that be possible? How could it go unnoticed for so long? Donny: I don't know. What if it's like your prehistoric fish that we talked about? Maybe it's adapted to its environment. Maybe it's learned how to hide. What if it's smart enough to know that we're a threat? Huh? To know to avoid us, till it has no choice. That'd be a very dangerous animal. (cell phone rings) -(engine dies) - Earl: 'Bout time. It's this way, fellas. (leaves rustle) Donny: Oh, no. How the... Earl: Yeah. No animal I know of kills like that. Any tracks? No. It's too cold, the ground's too hard. You boys get outta these woods right now. What? Why? Come on, Paul, it's the last two weeks of huntin' season. Whatever did this is still in those trees. Yeah, that's exactly why I wanna-- We're gonna handle this, Jim. Paul: You understand? No one from town's allowed into these woods. We make sure everyone is in their house before nightfall. Okay, Sheriff. You got that, Jim? Paul: I understand what you're saying. No, I do, but what I'm telling you is that people have been attacked and killed in our woods. Paul: Two dozen men armed enough to get a handle on this in 24 hours, that's what you're saying? I have your word? - Yeah. Yeah, you too. -(phone beeps) Donny: The coroner's gonna have a hell of a time getting those bodies down. Yeah. What'd the Rangers say? 24 hours. Paul: At least most people left 'cause of the storm. We'll be fine in town. We'll make do. Yeah. Radio: With no sign of letting up, the storm system continues to pound the local area. The Ranger Service encourages those in the storm's path to stay indoors. Record number of evacuees from Smith, Maiden's Wood, Knobb's Run and Tanner, have flooded the southern parts of the state. Currently, local passes, roadways, and even sections of the state highway remain dosed until further notice. For more updates on the storm, stay tuned. Hey, it's me. Um, I just wanted to thank you for taking Adam tonight. Susan". (phone) He was scared with the storm, and all that's been going on. Being with you makes him feel safe. I love you. (knocking) Donny: Hey, finished my rounds. Most of the town evacuated. - Paul: Good. - Donny: What's going on? Paul: I'm gonna show you something. I put a call into the Sheriff up in Tanner, when I heard the news said the wildlife migration affected them, as well. Paul: He sent me this. Two weeks ago, a crew of loggers went missing just outside of Tanner. I think that the logging it forced the animal south towards us. All these years, it's been able to live in these remote parts of the forest. There's a police report for two missing cattle in Tanner. And then two days later, yours truly. -(bridle tag jingles) - Number 88. Ron Jenkins' missing horse. So the foresting, it just flushed it out right towards us. And there's... There's no more forest to the south. - So it's trapped. - Paul: It's threatened. I think it's fighting for territory. Sit down. (knocking at door) Get caught up on this stuff. (knocking at door) Yeah. I keep a camera out in the woods, so I can keep track of the larger bucks at night. It has an infrared sensor. Records any movement when it's triggered. What are we looking for, Jim? You'll know it when you see it. Whoa. That was it. It coulda been a deer. Yeah, that's what I figured. Till I looked at the footage. I looked closer, and caught this. Jim: I'll leave these with you. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna head out too, boss. You notice the cell service is down? Always happens during a storm. All right, I'll see you in the morning, boss. (storm winds blow) (creature breathes) (wood creaks) (sudden thump) Adam: Dad! -(violent thump) -(creature growls) What was that? Paul: Get in the bathroom, now. Get up, come on. (eerie clicking) -(glass shatters) -(creature growls) Get into the tub. Get low. (items clatter downstairs) -(creature growls) -(footsteps thud) Donny? Donny? Hey, boss, you say something? -(creature growls) -(items clatter) I think there's interference from the storm, or something. Donny, it's in the house. Paul: (radio) It's in the house. I'm coming. -(siren wails) - Hold on, I'm coming. (creature's footsteps thump) -(footsteps thump) -(stairs creak) (siren wails) (creature roars) (glass shatters) (footsteps thud rapidly) (creature roars) Stay here. No! Just stay down. Lock this door as soon as I step out. Okay? It'll be fine. "(Donny yells) -(footsteps gallop away) (gunshot) Paul: Donny! You all right? - Paul: You all right? - Donny: Yeah. Paul: Did you see it? It just knocked into me. All right, let's gather everyone left in town. We'll stay at the church tonight. (wind blows) You all know about the tracks found going through town, this week. Yesterday, we discovered the bodies of two men in the woods just outside of town. Now, what left those tracks also killed those men. A lot of people have long believed that something lives in our woods. I didn't wanna alarm any of you until I knew for certain, but tonight it attacked my home. A few weeks ago, a logging camp opened up 90 miles north of here. We believe that it drove the creature south, looking for a new home. With the animals on the run, it's looking for food. And it found us. It's strong. It's fast, and it's smart. But I believe that we can get through this together. So we're gonna stay here, tonight. As soon as that storm passes and the roads clear in the morning, the Forest Department will have Rangers crawling all over these woods to hunt this thing down. How many Rangers, Sheriff? Dozens. All we have to do is get through the night, and we will. How do we know it won't just find us, here? It's a trap, like a bunch of damned rats. This church, it's our best and only option. Paul: It's strong, it's defendable. Once morning comes, you'll be safe. This is where we need to be. (wind blows) (gun clicks) Ah, thank you. Susan: Is it that bad? (Paul sighs) Oh, no, it's uh... It's just a precaution. You never were a good liar, Paul. That's all right, I gave it up. Good man. Situation like this, most men start drinking. You don't seem too worried, yourself. Ah, worrying never added a day to anybody's life. You know what happens after a forest fire? Land comes back stronger. Well... I guess I'm drinking for both of us, huh? Susan: Adam wanted to draw, he was bored. (Donny laughs quietly) So what are we drinking to? Hope. Sometimes that's all you got. I guess hope is what we'll roll with, huh? - Donny: Hey. - Hey. How you doing? Susan: You were good out there. I'm serious, Paul. They believe that you can protect them. That no matter what happens, they can trust you. I can't protect these people. I couldn't protect Tim. It wasn't your fault. He loved you so much. He wouldn't want you to be sad. I've been... I've been seeing him, lately. He's there and then he disappears. I feel like I'm going crazy. Maybe... He just wants you to know that everything is okay? I shoulda been there. I shoulda protected him. I am so sorry, Susan. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have moved out. I shouldn't have let you think that I didn't need you. Because I need you, Paul. Adam needs you. These people need you. (sudden thud against the doors) - Adam: Mom! - Susan: Adam! -(heavy thud) -(creature growls) Boss! Donny: Boss! (muffled thud) (people exclaim) Man: It's okay, here, come on. Come on, come on. I gotcha. Stay with-- -(loud thuds) -(several people cry out) Everyone away from the windows and the door. Paul: Just stay calm. Donny: Stay calm, everybody. -(creature growls) -(door thuds) -(gun cocks) -(door thuds) You think it's gonna hold? No, I don't. The basement... It was a shelter in the 60s, right? Yeah, but it's jam packed. I don't think we'll all fit. It's gonna have to do. Come on! Everyone downstairs, let's go. Let's (people speak over each other excitedly) Donny: Come on, now, let's go, quickly. (door pounds) Go, go, go. Go. -(people chatter) - Ron: Watch your step. Donny: Come on, guys. Quick! (pounding continues from upstairs) Donny, get these rifles ready. Lock and guard the door. - Donny: Wait, wait, - Susan: What's going on? Donny: where are you going? (pounding intensifies upstairs) Those doors aren't gonna hold much longer. Don't go. It's gonna be okay, the doors are gonna hold. I love you. I love you, too. -(doors pound) -(several people exclaim) Buddy, come on, give me a hug. Where's my hug? Come on. Where are you going? I gotta take care of you and your mommy, all right? But you gotta do me a favor. You look after her while I'm gone. Paul: Okay. I'm going up with you. That's what I'm here for. Donny, someone's gotta stay down here and protect these people. Earl and I'll do it, Sheriff. Earl: Your deputy's right. You going up there alone isn't doing anybody any good. We'll hold here. I won't take my gun off that door. -(Paul sighs) - Come on. You hold that door. Yes, sir. (dramatic music) (creature pounds on doors) Stay close. - It stopped banging. -(electricity buzzes) (fuse blows) -(creature growls) - Paul: Come on. (door squeaks) Paul: It's inside. -(creature growls softly) -(isolated bang) (Paul and Donny breathe loudly) (sudden bang) (floorboards creak) This is the only way out of the hall. Stay here in case it gets around me. Are you sure? Just don't let it leave this hallway. 'Kay. -(jar clatters to the floor) -(jar clinks across the floor) (creature hisses) (items clatter) (kitchenware clatters) (utensils squeak) (tin can rattles on ground) (Donny grunts) (gunshot) (creature roars) -(people nervously exclaim) -(creature roars) Man: It's okay, it's okay, it's gonna be fine. -(creature clicks) -(blood squishes) (creature thuds and clicks) (creature footsteps approach) (creature growls) -(gunshots) -(creature screams) - Paul: Donny! - Donny: Boss! In here. -(Donny pants) - Paul: What happened? It is fast, I didn't even see... You all right? I shot it. It's hurt. (Donny breathes heavily) Go get it. Go get it, I'll be fine. You need to go protect the people. Go! (creature hisses) -(thudding footsteps approach) -(creature snarls) -(Paul grunts) -(rapid fire gunshots) (creature growls) (massive thudding from upstairs) (Paul grunts) -(footsteps thud) -(creature clicks) (gun clicks) -(gunshots) -(creature roars) (creature breathes) (glass shatters) (creature snarls) (dramatic music) (creature roars) (gunshots) -(creature growls) -(Paul cries out) -(Paul grunts) -(creature screams) (creature screams) (thuds and roaring from upstairs) (people breathe shakily) (peaceful piano music) (door rattles) Paul: It's me, open up. Open the door. It's safe. -(Susan gasps) - Adam: Dad! Susan: Oh, he's okay! - Susan: You okay? - Yeah. (Ron and Claire laugh) Everything's gonna be fine. (tranquil music) (Paul sighs) Paul: It's over, now. What is it? Donny: I shot it in the shoulder. I took a whole chunk out of it. (storm winds blow) (creature growls) (dramatic music)
