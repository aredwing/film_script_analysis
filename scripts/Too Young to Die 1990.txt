I do everything, Which for me is Possible. I do Not want to die. Some do not do it. Act was punishable by death. They viilsi man's throat. This is too demanding for me. is in my hands, and ... This is too much for me. This would Salomon ... Really big ... This is what just happened, Buddy. You can do this? To sentence him to death and go home to sleep. How old is Cathy? 12? Think of him going to the gas chamber. Many of the children whose lives have been as Amanda, read by doctors. He made a choice. I do not want to see anyone die. How could this have had? Jean. How did you find me? - That was the news in Denver. - Denver up? I'm trying to find your mother. I called every damn RV area throughout the country. When the mother says that he goes he is serious. - What is Frank doing? - Good. He runs his brother garages. - Nice. Have you had a child yet? - I'm pregnant. - Great. When? - In August. - Which one is it? - We do not know. - We want to surprise. - I do not. Let me know immediately. I will not tolerate uncertainty. What happened? I do not know. He was ... If you get a baby girl, can you give him the name Mandy? Annan. I would consider it. I would have been a good mother. A really good mother. All that arise. Seated. Now the time has come declare the punishment. Lawyers, Prepare to loppuyhteenvetoonne. Jurors, you deserve the honor wise, brave decision. You have brilliantly kept separate from facts and references - innocence and youth. Decision respects the only innocent in this affair, - the victim, Michael Medwicki. It would be easy to give Amanda Sue Bradley - benefits of compassion. We hope that his life would have been easier. The truth is that he had enough old deprive another person. He killed a man. The father of two small children. He has to suffer the consequences of their actions. And to be executed. If Amanda's criminal would be an isolated incident ... If he had only a teenager, whose offense is punishable by death - should be taken into account mitigating circumstances. It is sad that Amanda is a part - growing problem, toward which our country is going. You know, read the magazines. Every day there are stories that riot all cities the streets, killing and raping. It is a new kind of youth, and Amanda is one of them. We must give a clear message for all the world Amado - that they can not get off the hook after pahuuksiaan. He must die for their crimes! We must protect the innocent, God-fearing citizens - In this ... ... And this. Thank you. Mr. Thornton. Before turning to the question, what to do with Amanda Sue Bradley - Let us ask first ourselves is one thing. How can we who are here now, we could find ourselves in that situation? A situation in which the Oklahoma Land to ask you - to send a 15-year-old girl the gas chamber. We know how Amanda Sue faced with this situation. As early as age 14, his stepfather was repeatedly raped her, - mother and 18-year-old husband were abandoned him, and he had been sold - strippauskerhoon with men - such as Billy Canton pumped him drugs, and used. Amanda wanted most in life love and family. Michael Medwicki placed his hands on his around and promised all that. He moved to the man, and the point they ended up in the same bed. And just like everyone else, he dismissed her. He returned to the single world, which and knew where Billy was waiting for Canton. I do not want to belittle what happened to Hornessa oil field, Oklahoma. It was tragic. But tragedy is also ours. Amanda is a child of our time. The prosecutor is right in saying that a lot of kids who are on the street. But if he is guilty, society is also to blame. Designed to protect children this sort of abuse - and rejections, but we have failed in it. Do you want to hide that mistake now sending him to the gas chamber? Do you want to condemn him to death, before he gets the opportunity to live in? You have condemned him to the crime. Send him to jail, but do not kill him. - Have you made a decision? - Yes. Will the accused rise and approached the judge. Read the court decision. We have unanimously decided that the defendant was sentenced to death. Execution by lethal gas is After 30 days. When will they come? Point. They take me to the death cell. I'm dying now. I'm dying now. at least 16 years of age executions. Currently, 28 teens waiting on death row.
