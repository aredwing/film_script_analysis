You fellas seem real jumpy. How'd you get out? - Parole. - After only three years? Good behaviour. This paper says l have to report in to the local law officer wherever l am. Check-in day is Monday. Figurin' on stickin' around? For a while. - Your old spread belongs to Mr Pierce now. - L heard that. Lt's his legally, so you stay off it. Oh, l'll sure do that. Maybe prison took some of the starch out of you. Maybe. Where's Lomax? - Ln Randado. The Oriental Palace. Billy Hyatt's in Chubisco. - Levi? He's down by Mesquite, with Calita's gang. What about the shipment? - The big one's four days from now. Ooesn't give us much time. Nope. Put back that salt. The salt! Pierce catches you stealin' now, you won't be worth a damn to me. Mr Pierce. - Oid it get here yet? - No, it will by the trip after next. That's when we want her. Alright, let's clean her up. Check the rim on the left front wheel. - Yes, sir. Beauty! Mr Pierce, Taw Jackson's in town. - What? He's out on parole. - Where is he? - l don't know. Oon't you know he could take a shot at Mr Pierce? - Get Hammond and Brown. You think he'll try somethin'? - Wouldn't you? L want you in Rondado before sun-up. Find Lomax. L want him to kill Taw Jackson. L'll pay him anything he wants. You'll pay him anything, sir? L'll go for 10,000. Hell, Mr Pierce, we'd be willin' to do it for a lot less than 10,000. Lf you could. Lomax is the one man that can, so get movin'. Yes, sir. Boss, you know the way they feel about each other. Lomax would probably kill him for nothin'. Unless there's money in it, Lomax'll do nothin' for nothin'. And l want Taw Jackson dead. What'll ya have? - Whiskey. L understand Lomax is around. So? L wanna see him. - Yeah, and who are you? Taw Jackson. Enjoy you're drink. Lt'll be your last. Well, that'd be a shame. Kinda hoped that my last drink'd be a big one. Bottle's in front of you. Pour it out. Gonna shoot me in the back? - You deserve it. You caused me a lot of embarrassment. - How? You're the only man l ever shot and didn't kill. Well, if it makes you feel any better, that slug you put in me kept me in hospital for six months. What made you think l wouldn't kill you? Curiosity. Well, you're still alive. Now what's to keep you that way? Money. - How much? Your share'll be over 100,000. That's what l've always said the world needs: More simple understanding to bring people together. Lhotse! Khaloo! We can talk upstairs. - What l have to say is private. Can't get more private. Neither one of them speaks a word of English. Come on in! L hope this'll be friendlier than last time. - Couldn't be unfriendlier. Know why Pierce wanted you to kill me? So he could legally steal your land, once he found there was gold on it. You were just defending your ranch. But you got shot, framed and sent to jail. Thought that was kind of amusing. Nice to find a fella with a keen sense of humour. Old Pierce found a lotta gold on your land. That ore assays out at $643 a tonne, normally. But they've hit the motherlode, which'll be 1200 per cent richer. For a man out a short while you know a lot about his business. He's important to me. - You thinkin' about his gold? My gold. - Forget it. You can't get within a mile of it. Have some grub. No thanks. How about outta town? He has a new toy. An iron-plated thing he calls the War Wagon. Takes an average of 50,000 in gold from Emmett to the station in El Paso. Forty-three miles away. - There are a few guards. Thirty-three of them. Twenty-eight outriders and five in the coach. Each man has a Henry repeating rifle, two Colts and 200 rounds. So what? - We're going to take that wagon. We are? You taken a look lately at the cemetery at Emmett? There's a big bunch of cheap wooden crosses, all crowded in together. That's a tribute to the last fools who tried to stop the War Wagon. You like facts? $1.15 for the casket, and 12 cents for the crosses. Pierce foots the bill. $1.27 seems a poor price to pay for a man's life, especially mine. Ln four days, Pierce is going to make the biggest gold shipment ever. A half a million dollars. A half a million? How we gonna take it, with the Prussian army? With three others. Five of us. Five. L'm kinda glad l didn't kill you tonight. You're funny. Wanna hear how? - How we end up in jail or on the run? Not my way. - No chance. $100,000, Lomax, that's your share. You ready to listen? Why me? - You're good with guns. And the only safecracker l know. How'd you find that out? - An old friend of yours in prison. For the last time, are you gonna listen? Alright. Let's hear it. Stony Flats. The War Wagon. Yeah! One condition. - What's that? My time till the robbery costs $100 a day, and if l fire my gun $500. Haven't got that kind of money. L'll take a marker against your share. Lt's a deal. You always wear a gun? Just lately. Morning, Mr Lomax. - Hello, Smitty. - You want l should saddle your horse? Your in the third stall on the left. There he is. Lomax! - Morning, Lomax. What do ya want? Mr Pierce would like to talk to you. - What for? Lt's about Taw Jackson. What about Taw Jackson? Mr Pierce said he'll go all the way up to 10,000 dollars. Hey, Taw, you hear that? - L heard. You're worth a lot of money. Oead. Taw, this wasn't our idea at all. We're just deliverin' a message. Yeah. What's your answer? Tell him l'll be thinkin' about it. Yes, sir, we sure will. Come on. The boss ain't gonna like that answer. - L know it. Why don't we do it? Mr Pierce would be very grateful. Ain't no better time! Mine hit the ground first. Mine was taller. Yes, sir, a good way to start our partnership. How's that? - A $500 day. L didn't ask for your help back there. - Can't afford to let you get killed unless l do it. Hey, why are we headed south? - To pick up Levi Walking Bear. Levi who? - Walking Bear. He's running with Calita's gang, down on the border. Pretty rough outfit. - Yeah. Well, we need him. He's worth 100,000 dollars to ya. Ninety. Buenos das. - Buenos das. Whose pigs are these? Yours? Fine. Lnformation? Buenos das, Seorita. - Welcome, Seor. Tequila? Sure. Thank you. Salud! You're a pretty little girl. - Little girl? Well, you're not a little boy. Where's Calita's camp? Oon't know. Are you sure? Well, then. How about a drink? A little one. That's good! Gracias, Seor. Where did you get that? - L sleep on this ring. Yes, every night like this. For the tequila. Oo you not want anything else? - Later. Let's go. - Go where? Calita's. Third canyon south, two miles up. You have to appeal to their intellect. Let me guess which one's your friend. Hey, don't shoot! Well... - Yeah. Come on. Yah! Hey, comrades! Ready? Who the hell are you? - Shut up. Oon't drop your arm. What? Where ya goin'? - Another target. Get outta here! My horses! Where are my horses? Looks like we made it. Thanks, Taw. You might say l owe you fellas my life. - Yeah, yuh might. Lomax. Levi Walking Bear. So you're Lomax. - What was that all about back there? We were playin' poker. - So? L was cheatin'. Hey, you got a bargain, big man. - How's that? Two $500 days for the price of one. Thanks. Why'd you stick your necks out for me? We got a job for yuh. Lomax, l want you to swing over to Chubisco. - Chubisco? Pick up Billy Hyatt and bring him out to the old mission. Sure hate being away from yuh. That's how it's gonna have to be. Oon't let anything happen to yuh. Not likely. Beautiful thing to see. Friendship. Yeah. You seen a fella named Billy Hyatt? Yeah. Where? - There. What are ya doin'? You Billy Hyatt? - Yeah. Stand up. L can't even sit up. - Come on, l said stand up! L'm doin' ma best. Got a horse? - What? - Have yuh got a horse? - No. Come on. L ain't goin' no place. Let me alone. Let me off, Mister. - Not yet, sonny. - My head's splittin'. Yuh stink! Tell me kid, what are you good for? Good for? - You heard me. Nothin'. L'm good for nothin'. - L believe it. Taw must be loco. Taw Jackson? Ls he out? - We're on our way to join him. Ooggone! Me and him spent two years in prison together. - Heart-warming. That means Taw must be ready to... - Yes? A thing we talked about. Listen, mister, this has gone far enough. Let me down. L will, sonny, l will. What did you do that for? You share my horse, l want you sober. And cleaner. You can walk yourself dry. Who's that? The War Wagon. - So that's it. You in with Taw? - More or less. Then l reckon l can tell you what l'm good for. Explosives. Explosives? Hammond and Brown get back? - No, Sir. - What about Lomax? Lomax? Not again. Hello, Jackson. Lt's Monday morning, and l'm reporting in. That's no concern of mine. Tell the deputy or the sheriff. Same thing, you own 'em. - Alright, Taw, you're reported in. L hear you're stayin' at my ranch. - Lt used to be yours. Nice place. L oughta know. L built it. - And you did a real fine job. L'll be out there one day this week. - Thinkin' of tryin' to get it back? Think about it all the time. - You wouldn't stand a chance. Tell you what l'll do for you, though. L'll see that you get buried there. Between then and now, l'm comin' out to pick up my stuff. Lt still there? How would l know? - Oh, it all disappeared, somehow. - Ain't nothin' there belongs to you. This man's wearin' my gun. You're wrong. My Pa gave me this. Lf you want it back, Taw, why don't you take it away from him. Lt's mine. What's goin' on? - Just collectin' somethin' of mine. Who started it? - L guess you could say l did. The shells in here belong to him. He can come and get them anytime. Throw some water on 'em. Taw! L heard. Hey, Taw! - Hello, Billy. - How ya keepin'? You look worse than you did in jail. - Nothin' a drink wouldn't fix. Got anything? - He's a drunk. - He drinks. Way he's been shakin', l wouldn't trust him with a firecracker. Ls that true, Billy? - Some folks look at it that way. But l'm alright, Taw. L can handle it. There's a lot at stake here. - L can handle it. Good enough. - L don't trust drunks. Neither do l. But Billy stays here. And there's nothing stronger than that cowboy coffee you're drinkin'. You're sure he knows explosives? He handles them like you do a gun. Hope you know what you're doin'. That'll be Wes. Come on, come on. Sit down! - What's she doing here? - She goes every place l go. Lomax, this is Fletcher. He's going to haul the gold away. Why him? - L work for Pierce. Nobody'll find half a million in gold in Pierce's own flour barrel. Half a million? When do we split it up? Wouldn't be too smart to flash gold around right after the robbery. We should wait about six months. - Six months? Let's don't spend it before we get it. Hands off my wife! - L thought she was your daughter. - Well, she ain't! Billy! - You keep away from her! A drunk kid and a crazy old man! - Cut it out, all of ya! You're not here to be the best of friends. We've work to do, and only three days to do it in. Come on over here. This map shows the run from Emmett to El Paso. Ln the morning, Billy, l want you to ride it and check these two places. Find out how much dynamite you're gonna need. The wagon takes five and a half minutes to cross Stony Flats. That's where we'll hit it first. Well, see ya later, partner. - Where you goin'? - To town. L got another partner there, remember? - L remember. We wouldn't want him to be impatient, and hire somebody else. Take good care of him. Levi... Let us pass! Alright. We walk from here. Oumb lndians! Looks like they're movin' out. - They are. Squaws, old men, children. Pierce has starved them out. What about Wild Horse? - He's staying. Pierce'll hunt him down too. Oumb lndians! And you're smart? - Sure! L've learned to live in a white man's world. Grab all you can, anytime you can. Wait here. Your enemy is my enemy. - Taw! Chief Wild Horse, Natani Jackson. - Too many warriors have died. He says, Your enemy is his enemy. - Good. No. He says he will lose too many braves. Ask him does he ride with warriors or women. Lf you want my tribe and my warriors, l will do it. He will do it, but he wants more of everything. - He does or you do? Bargain with him. - What exactly do you want? And 30 pounds of salt. Tell him he drives a hard bargain. But we'll agree. You can stay. But the white man must go. Lt is done. He wants me to stay to dinner, but you're not welcome. Having a white man here offends him. - You can tell him... - What? Nothing. Three sixes. - Beats me. Hello, Lola. Lt's been a long time, Lomax. May l join you? - Sure. - Looks like you're still a winner. L lose every once in a while. How's your laundry service? Oh, they can't even speak English. - A pity. Any limit? Lf there was, you wouldn't play. Fifty. - L'm out. Lola! - Hello, Mr Pierce. - Too rich for me. Two cards. - You get my message? - Yeah. Took you long enough to get here. - L had things to do. What happened to those two men? L last saw them in the main street in Randado. Three ladies. You win, precious. Let's go someplace private. - L like it here. Hey, barkeeper how much for whiskey around here? Two bits. That's two cents. You gonna give me an answer or not? - L'm thinkin' about it. How much is that? - 27 cents. Set it right there. Keep the change. - Thanks. L'll go twelve thousand. Twelve? L changed my mind. Give me another two cents' worth! Go out and walk it off. Listen, l figure on bein' an important person some day. You wanna treat me right. Oh, l will. What do yuh say? - L'm still thinking about it. Come on, bartender. - Not for two cents. But l done told you, me and my friends are gonna be rich! Sure. Well, come back then. Hello there, cowboy. You havin' trouble gettin' a drink? L'm gonna buy this... hey! What's goin' on down there? This drunk just insulted the lady. Lock him up till he sleeps it off. What'd he do? - You didn't notice? No. - You been workin' saloons too long. What'd you do that for? - L hate bad manners. L'm gettin' tired of this run-around. Yes or no on the twelve thousand? Yes. And l want it done quick. - Oon't push me. L'll do it when l'm ready! What's your pleasure? Stud. What room is Seor Lomax in? Five, Seor. Five? Who's there? - Lt's me. We may be in trouble. Billy's missing... - He's in jail. Ln jail? - Orunk. You know how close he came to naming all his rich friends? - No. That close. - L guarantee he'll never take another drop. You guarantee that he won't blow us all sky high? He knows what he's doin'. - L don't care what he knows. L've stayed alive by not relying on anybody. L always go it alone. Precious? Always? Ls anything wrong? No, baby. You just straighten out that kid. And Pierce upped the ante on you. You're worth 12,000 to me. Oead. And 100,000 alive. One's a gamble. Other's a sure thing. Lomax, nothin's a sure thing. Precious? L didn't feel much like shootin' you this morning anyway, partner. Neither did l... precious. Hey! L haven't got time to tell you what's on my mind. Go out to Wes's place and wait for me. Supposed to meet Taw here. How's your hand? L said, how's your hand. - Fine. Wes is due back any time. You best wait in the house. Oon't he let you talk to anybody? - To nobody. Reckon you can talk to me, then. L'm nobody. How old are yuh? - Eighteen, l think. Me too... far as l know. Say... how come you're married to Wes? L ain't, really. He bartered me. Bartered yuh? Folks traded me for twenty dollars and a horse. They's poor. L'd call that a lot worse than poor. Ain't much never mind. Same here as it was with them. Oo your work and keep your mouth shut. - Twenty dollars and a horse. You're worth... a little more than that. How come you're in on this stealin'? For the money. L'm gonna have me 100,000 dollars. Make me a very important person. Why? 'Cause it will. What are you doin' here? - Taw told me to meet him here. He tell you to hang around my wife? - Should l wait up on the mountain? Oon't sass me, boy. - He ain't done nothin'. - Get back to work! Leave her alone! Come on, boy. - Fletcher! Put it away. Come here, Billy. You're not going to say a word, or make a move, unless l tell yuh. You go over the route? - Yeah. What are yuh gonna need? - How long is the wagon, from the lead horse back? Forty-seven and a half feet. L'll need about 500 feet of two-ounce hemp twine, four bottles of gin... Gin? You said time is important. - That's right. - Then no dynamite. Fuses don't burn that dependable. What are you figurin' on? - Nitroglycerine. Nitro? Wes! - Yeah. He's figurin' on usin' nitroglycerine. You know where there is any? - Pierce has got some. Where does he keep it? - At your ranch, in a safe. Ln a safe? You know the combination? - No. Let me show yuh somethin'. Ever see a shell like this before? - Yeah. L took in 10,000 rounds to Pierce last week. A Gatling gun. L just seen Jackson in the Lucky Oeuce, and Lomax is in there. Get the sheriff. L want this whole thing to be legal. Bartender, set 'em up on me. L buy my own. You refusing my hospitality? L'm ignoring it. Well, l take that as an insult. You take it any way you want. Whiskey! L said, whiskey! We don't serve lndians. - Then l serve myself. Have one with me. - Sure. No thanks! You too good to drink with lndian? - That's right. Oh no! You might say l saved your life. - Yeah! What you do that for? - Get the horses! L'm the one you hired to shoot Jackson. Why didn't you? You had the chance. - He never went for his gun. What are yuh gonna' do? - L'm goin' after him. Lomax! What sort of stupid stunt was that? We need you tonight. - You said tomorrow. Change of plan. The kid wants nitro. Nitroglycerine? - Lt's in a safe you have to open. Forget it! L'm not gonna be anywhere near that drunk and nitro. That cut's it! Nobody takes a half a million just sittin' around. Either you cut it out, or we call the whole thing off. Alright. Lt'll cost ya 2,000 more. - Not from me. - Then forget it. Take 2,000 of mine. You're a good lndian. - Alright, Levi. Go pick up Wild Horse. We'll get the kid. Hey, Taw. For a minute at the saloon, l thought you were gonna draw. For a minute l was. Lt'll be that shack on the left. What a place. Yeah. Well, might as well relax till dark. Nitroglycerine! Oon't! You got five minutes. Get goin'. That you, Frenchy? - Yeah. What's up? - You want a cup of coffee. - L want a cup of coffee. Me too. Just leave it, right there. Sure you know what you're doin'? That's far enough. You two get over in the corner. Now, Shack, get rid of that gun. What are you doin' here? Just visitin'. And l've gotta give you credit. - For what? For your good taste. You haven't changed a thing. What do you want? - My belongings. Everything in here belongs to me. - L want my clothes. L burned them. - Even those upstairs in the trunk? There's nothin' up there except... - Why don't you go get it? We'll wait here. - Oo what the man says. Just exactly! Yes, sir. Why don't you make yourself comfortable? L'm comfortable. Well? Yeah. Careful! Ooes it always smoke like that? - Huh? Ooes it always smoke like that? Yeah. These what you mean? - That's it. You'd risk your neck for those rags? - Whose neck? We've got two minutes. Get going. Thanks for your hospitality. - Glad you got what you came for. So am l. Oon't anybody get too anxious to go out this door. Well, don't stand there, go get him. Yes, Sir. Come on! Bunkhouse! Lt's Taw Jackson. Get him! Where are they goin'? - Pierce has run 'em out. All except Wild Horse. Bring her on out! That's really something, Mr Pierce. - She's practically heavy artillery. Alright, load her up and let's go. - Yes, sir. Load her up! Everything set with Wild Horse? - He's on his way. Lt's that time. Come on! - Yeah. Hold it steady. - L'm tryin'. How hot's it get around here? - Ninety, ninety-five. Sometimes more. You better get me a canteen, then, so as l can water them down a little. Yeah. You need any more help? - L can rig the twine. L'll just wet 'em down once more. - L'll see ya later. L got it. Lt's the next ravine, Wes. - Right. We're running a little late. - Lt's that extra weight, Mr Pierce. How's it going? - L'll be ready. What's that? - The Kiowa tribe. Pierce has got 'em beat. Look's like Wild Horse's men are ready. You think he's gonna fall for that old dust routine? You better hope so. You got 100,000 ridin' on it. Mr Pierce! - Yeah? - We're bein' followed. Looks like the whole Kiowa tribe. Have the riders drop back! Everybody pull back! Hold it! Let's get back to the wagon. Well. - Yeah. What's goin' on back there? - L don't know, Mr Pierce. Looks like the boys are comin' back. Lndians don't blow up bridges. Knock on it! There's a crossing upriver. - That's three miles away. We got no choice. Let's go. Mr Pierce! Look! Gimme a hand here. That oughta hold 'em. Let's go. We're goin' the wrong way. Here they come. We're on the wrong road. What the hell... Let's get out of here! - You're guarding this gold. - Not me! He's right, Mr Pierce. - You too? L'm gonna dump it in this gulch! Jump! Look like you'll get your ranch back. Get those barrel tops off. That looks mighty pretty. Give me a hand. That's the last of it. Well, get goin'. Take it easy. Taw! He says to keep away from our guns. Oirty, double-crossin'... You leave that be! Know what you're always sayin'? Lf we're gonna die, let's have one last drink. Ls that...? - Yep! After you, Taw. Oon't mind if l do. Get that wagon! Lndian expert! Why didn't you stop them? How do l go about that? Taw's right. They'll fight you. Shut up, lndian! - L know my people. To them it's flour. - What about the gold? Lt's just food. - Great! L'm out 100,000, and 2,000 from Levi. Where are you goin'? Back to my people. What am l supposed to do? Open up a bakery? With Pierce dead, it don't even pay to kill you any more. You owe me 100 a day and 500 when l used my gun. That's $1,200. Now? - Now! L haven't got that kind of money. All l own is standing right there. L'll take it. - My horse? - You're damn right. You'd leave me out here without a horse? Penniless? That's your problem, partner. What happened? - Well, we lost part of it. Toss me those saddlebags. We'll still meet... in six months and divide it. But you'll need something to live on. Be careful where you spend it. - We will. Thanks, Taw. When you catch up with Lomax, tell him where you got it. He's gonna be mad. - Yeah. How much? And what did you do with it? - 100,000. l hid it. - Where? L'll tell you in about six months. - Six months! L want it now. - Lt wouldn't be very smart to start flashing gold dust around right after a robbery, would it? What am l supposed to do till then? - Well... for one thing, you better make damn sure l stay alive. Thats a 24-hour-a-day job. - That's your problem, partner.
