He said there would be changes important in my life... improve my professional life, that, at best, I moved. Also something of a relationship. Are not you surprised? - And do not say where to put that ficus? - I am serious! He also said something about a trip and one death. Could you choose?

I'm a friend of his and this is my girl. Can you become a star before Friday? Unemployment is running out. " Jerk. At least sleep more than just underwear. - Last night I did not think. - You disgust me. Why does it always reduces everything to sex? At best, I can not. But at least I try, dammit.

Larry, you are stupid. You know go. On the fourth floor. The apartment shows. You enter by scaffolding. There we go all. Stupid ass. This building is heritage. Our company rehabilitates these beautiful old buildings... trying to keep all original building as possible. Look at the lighting. As you see, has all kinds amenities. And there's a bathroom you will love. - Who are you? - I was checking the pipes. Out! I think everything is working. - Here, it is yours. - How's that? - You want a sandwich? - No, thanks, buddy. I've done that. What? I've done that. God! Who has degraded and the color has changed you? I just went through an experience terrible. It was horrendous. He was on the show floor taking a bath... and presents three Arab girls. I have attempted to link... and they said that was better-looking Yasser Arafat. To the Arabs, I will go. For if they will progress, to you were of pearls. So they molas to these aunts. Man, is not there where they do not eat sausage? Nor do I believe that your wife eat a lot around here. And what did she say? "Will you leave behind ear and then I smoke it? " - Secure! - Listen, you tell a joke quickly. He is a guy from Liverpool and his wife that are strolling down the Casbah... and an old Moorish has on a poster... "Magic shoes. 10 pounds the pair. Improve your sex life. " So the woman says "Buy a couple"... Liverpool and says "Give me a couple, you sure they work? " "Efendi, Master of Thousand Camels purchase these shoes... and you'll see how it works the device... " So you put them, grab the Moor, check it on the counter... and starts to beat you there dale. And the old man yells... "Effendi, Effendi standing is wrong! " - Jo, hey... - Give me a sandwich of these, Mo. They say that yours are living in huts, no? Yes, look, my father's has two floors, with carpet... - And I study law, if you like. - No, I'm serious... I'm thinking about going back. - What I am saying. - Now he wants to go to Africa... - But if you've never been. - So what? You either. - There has been no in Liverpool. - I do. You go every fortnight to sign the arrest. - I mean in West Africa. - Come on. Really? Lagos, Luanda... Kabinda Matardi, Kalabar... Worldwide, with the Merchant Navy. - It is not true, Larry. - Four years on the Mayflower. I've seen these cities in the atlas. What are they? Matardi is a paradise, man. - Matardi is fucking bullshit. - If you only have stayed in Nigeria... - Come on, shut up... - No, man, I've been Matardi. And speaking of shit, this volume yes that is fucking bullshit. Notice that there is no security, no protection... - No nothing. - It's true. We live here. We must talk with office and require security. - What? - That's what unions, right? - Why, Larry? - Without them, we would have nothing. - Yes - What we have now? - We still have nothing. - Hold on, let's see... If tomorrow he falls from scaffolding and loses an eye, do not give anything. If you fall and kill yourself, do not pay the Funeral to take you to Liverpool. At least if you are a union cobras when you're low. We must make a common front. If not, no security measures. I agree with the union... but you do what instructed the Conservatives. A search of work. Man, what remedy? He's from Glasgow. We, Liverpool. He, of Bristol. We come from all over the UK.
