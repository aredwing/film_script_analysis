What are doing? Come on let's go. You know, this island is famous for its own carnival. Yeah. We just missed it. He reminded me of the, um, the surly sailor, what's his name? From the Philippines. With the tattoos. Yeah kind of. Kind of like a younger version of him. Yeah. You don't wanna... OK. What do you think? Well, it's not very crowded. This is weird. Are you sure this is the place? Looks like they just up and left. They can keep hiding. Or whatever. But I am thirsty and I need to eat. -OK. A lot of soda. A lot of beer. -Oh no, not the red thing, I don't... -Salut -Salut -And to eat? I mean this is just... -Well can I interest you in..? -No. -Alright. You relax.

Anyone at the store? -I did not. -Oh. But I did get you a present. It's nice. -It's not possible. -I've been thinking about it really. The only possible explanation is that, you know, it's carnival. Everybody's still asleep or drunk. -But even old folks? -Especially the old folks! -I saw a girl. -Where did she go? Well she was right here but she just left. Ran off. -So are you still hungry? -Mmm. We got bread, crackers, palomitas, some olives... oh look what I got for Nory. -Oh! -Right? That is so cute. She's going to love it. Francis? Do we have enough gas to get back? -Yeah. Yeah I think so. -Yeah? Hi. Yes, it is nice. Weird, but nice. Hello? I can't understand you can you speak English? Can you hear me?
