Or the house within space? Or are both space and the house within the seeing eye? Is the eye within the mind? Or the mind within the eye? Or are both the eye and mind within you? Does sweetness lie in sugar? Or is sugar in the sweetness? Or do both sweetness and sugar lie in the tongue? Is the tongue within the mind? Or the mind within the tongue? Or are both the tongue and the mind within you? Does the fragrance lie in the flower? Or the flower in the fragrance? Or do both the flower and the fragrance lie within the nostrils? I cannot say, O Lord Adikeshava of Kaginele, O peerless one, are all things within you alone? The patient has been here for 3 months... Vegetative state Sometimes we observe brain activity. He is under continual medication... ...but nothing helps. This is a ventilator... to pump oxygen. He cannot breathe on his own'? No sir, his life is controlled by these machines. Hmmm... If I remove this, there should be no problem right? No patient, no case... Yes sir... ...He will die peacefully. Poor fellow... why don't you remove it'? Are you scared of God? Camera... First it needs to be determined whether it is a murder or suicide attempt. This is definitely a murder attempt sir! Why would he want to commit suicide? Even if the investigation leads to a result, what can the court do? Euthanasia is banned in our country anyway right? If a body cannot survive without life support... ...the court may allow it. - Sir... - Oh, Kempraju, how are you'? - I am fine sir! - You are looking very smart! And yet no one wants to marry me...

Give us some time... we will come out with the results. Don't take this personally... the minister is under pressure. In such cases, a lot of people will lay claims... this is a very sensitive case. - OK sir. - Sanjay, he will brief you about the case. Please discuss with him. Sir! Does he know Kannada? I know a little sir... I have assigned your old partner to your team. - Thank you, sir! - I hope you give me quick results. Hey! wake up! Pucchi! I gave you a box that day, Where is it?

After I finished work at the talkies at night... I was heading home. I was having food from a food cart... a girl was going on a scooter with her father I was watching them. And when she went a little ahead, her bag fell off. These are cinema folks, this must be a story. What is this? Hello...? OK I am coming. Tell me who else is there? Spit it out!

Sanjay, all yours. Look darling, answer all his questions correctly. What is this? I don't know... I don't know! Sir, he's out... What now? The other piece is there. It is very soft, it will speak. Hey item... will you speak up or what? What is this? What? Lucia... Ninety lakh damned fools in Bangalore... like sheep in a pen! Me, I am another innocent lamb. My name is Nikki... ...hey! Not lkki! Nikki! I am from a small village near Mandya. I got trapped in this bloody circus three years ago. Thank god, my parents stayed back. No worries about accommodation... Thanks to my chuddy buddies. Our Shankranna, he owns this talkies... I am a torch shiner in the theater. The rogue, Shankranna, has great affection for me. Like a son! Hey! Go do your work I say! Go man! Life is great, but... I can't sleep at night! "LOVE POEM" Look at that guy pissing on the wall Let's take his trip... time pass! Yes sir. Bring him here. Right, sir. Hands up! What... who? - Up! Raise your hand. - Didn't do anything... - Up! Raise your other hand up. - Can't sir! I'll wet my pants! - Up with the other hand... - Cannot sir! I'll shoot you I say! Haha... come, sir is calling. Tie up your pants before they fall off! Go that way! Get over here! What are you doing out this late? Sir... couldn't sleep... that's why I stepped out sir. Where are you from? From a village near Mandya, sir! Get into the jeep, let's go to the station. What have I done sir? Standing in front of a girl's poster at night... indecent behavior in public! Which girl sir? Sir, I haven't done anything sir, let me go. I'll go home quietly. - Why are you laughing sir? - Are you drunk? Sir, upon my mother, I don't drink anything but water. Open your mouth! Thoo!

Oh damned fool, please give it back! Sir... sir... Sir! Have you no wife or children? Take my shorts as well! Had it been my village, I would have taken your trip! Hey!...call him here! Got a cup of coffee or tea? What is this midnight comedy of yours brother? Damn me as well! No sleep, and so much heat! I come out, and run into these rascals! You can't sleep? Every morning, I feel like an owl, my head feels all wrong. We have sleeping pills... want some? Pills for sleep? Really? We have pills for everything! Please give me some, let's see if it works... Get up! Come with me. Brother, I have nothing on me Please don't ask for money Today is my birthday. I'll give it for free. Really? May you sleep on your wedding night as well! Brother, where are the pills? Come on! Keep going! I am going, no need to push! Come on! Come on, keep moving. Someone's come, baby. I know, baby. Haven't I seen this guy somewhere? Huh... it's my face! Hey, brother, I am on camera! Yes, yes, you are the hero! We sleep for about 2 lakh hours in our lifetime. In your case, you can't sleep at all. Lucky fellow! Damn my luck! My head feels like it has been minced! They said you'll give me a sleeping pill. Give me a dose for a day or two. I'll take it and pass out. Why waste your time only with a sleeping pill? What does that mean, brother? You take my pills... Not just sleep, you'll also have good dreams! Is that so brother? When you are awake, you lead your sorry life. But when you're sleeping, you will live the life you want. Oh! What's the big deal about dreams? They come and go. Hey fool, you take my pill, and you will have just ONE dream, Like a mega serial, it will keep going on. Mega serial or a folktale... All I want is sleep. Every night, before you hit the bed, take this. It looks like a laxative. What is it called? What if I take this and die? Whatever must happen will happen... Once you start taking this, you must not stop. Else your dream will become a NIGHTMARE! Life will become difficult! Nikki, hey Nikki! Nikki, hey Nikki! Get up! Why are you sleeping here? Why not sleep in the vanity van? It's fine! Shall I cancel the shooting? Shall we go home? No, let's go on... It's already late Hand over the costume... I was sitting on the chair, suddenly I dozed off. I guess everyone must be waiting. Wear the costume. Which song are we shooting now? This song is absurd... Some fellow called Bhat has written it... It's terrible. Don't worry, it'll be a hit anyway... Let's finish quickly and leave... Sir, do you want anything? Bring me some juice... The ACP is here, just speak to him.. Hello, Mr. Nikhil, nice to see you again! Like your manager asked, We have provided you with maximum security ...you don't need to worry about anything now We'll take care of you. Security he says! Just two constables! Hey Mahadeva, how is everything? How are the kids? All doing fine, sir. Careful! The crane might break! - Sir, coffee? - No, he's asked for juice... Hi Kamini, looking hot!

What has made you like this? Why have you become so weak? Speak up, Shiva! What is your worry? I passed high school... ...but failed in love. I passed high school... ...but failed in love. Your story or mine It's the same sadness Where do I start? It ends even before I begin Just when you think it's done... ...it starts again. A girl rang the bell of my heart And smiled like a blossoming flower An old vanity bag left without stepping in In the smile of her eyes I saw a teardrop In the heat of moonlight A dog whelped A coffin for the dead moon Can we find? I wrote such a line On the back of an auto rickshaw Passed high school, but failed in love Passed high school, OK, Shiva! Stop, Shiva! Bye, Shiva! Sleep now, Shiva! Shankranna, it's time for the show... Not even ten tickets have been sold. Please listen to me... If you show Tamil or Telugu films... morning shows will run houseful. I am not so desperate. I only show Kannada films in my theater. Hmm... OK Shankranna... why don't you show a "special" film? What does "special picture" mean? See... Small budget... Brother, please let me go! How dare you suggest this? How dare you? This is my father's theater. It's not for prostitution. Let me go, Nikki! There she is, man. Let's catch her! Let me go! Please let me go... - Move it! - Gani! Gani...! Get going! Shut up! Do you know who I am? I don't care who you are. Let my Gani come... ...he'll take care of all of you! Let him come...

Are you comfortable? What would you like to have? No thanks. I don't want anything. Don't be formal. What is your brand? No, thanks. I'll be leaving in a few minutes. What is the hurry? We can watch a movie, get dinner. There is a pool outside. We can even go for a long drive. Anything you want, sir. Hello... Hey Nikki, what are you doing in her house? Hmm... I am outside. Come let's go. OK. My vehicle is here. Thank you. I will leave now. The thing is... Nikhil... I love you... Gani! I knew you would definitely come. I love you Sowmya. I love you too Gani! Why are you throwing those things? Don't throw the reels, I say... Listen to me. Don't you have brains? Come on, please stop it... Hey, baldy! You are acting like one of these movie villains! He is just a torch shiner. Let him go. I will come next month. I don't like this kind of work. I have to pay them for breaking things... and you have to pay them for putting it together. I will prepare the documents by next month. Come to the sub-registrar's office and sign them. Alright, even I am tired of showing films in this theater. Not a soul comes to watch. Raze it down and build a big mall. Give me a security guy's job here. Hey, let that boy go. Why the hell are you on the floor? Idiot! Go do your work. Why don't you stay? Have lunch and go. I will come next month. Don't miss it. OK, OK, I'll do it. Escort him carefully... he's had an open heart surgery. He's a nice guy. Oh God! I am seeing this for 15 years. Hey Nikki, why are you so scared? Their guns only had only dummy bullets. Fifteen years ago, I had made a film. This loafer only financed it. That movie never released. Now he wants me to write the theater in his name. My heart can stop... ...but the projector should keep running. Hey get up! It's the interval Why are you sitting as if stunned? They'll keep coming and going... ...we can't worry about tall that. What next for you? Two plates gobi, with a little more spice... What else? Dad, go slowly... And please balance the bike properly... You refuse to buy a car. A car? Dad, one minute... Stop! - Did the bag fall? - Oh look at this! All because of you! I told you I'll come by auto! By saving fifty rupees, will you marry me off in a palace? Oh God! Don't you want the bag? Hang on a minute. I'll take an auto from next time. Let's leave. Thank you. Cough... Cough some more. Cough some more. You are alright. See, he's been shot at close range... minor injuries, but he's fine. I will give you a detailed report. OK. Thank you. No problem. How are you doing? Are you in pain? Nikhil, did you get any threat calls? I told you he got two calls. One call came in the morning. Big stars get extortion calls like this. They attacked you with rubber bullets. They didn't want to harm you. It might be rubber bullets but look at the injuries. Can you identify anyone from these pictures? Have a look, sir. This might be him. Show me. OK, Nikhil. Don't worry. I will personally take care of this case... ...thank you. Sir, please don't tell anything about the heroine to the media. See, it's too early to give out anything about the case. We are proceeding with the investigations, don't worry. Who is behind this? No, sir, we are investigating. Everything will come out. See, the heroine has no role in the incident. Why are you dragging her in? Show me the piece on the top. This pink-colored one? How much did you say this is? Six thousand rupees... It's a little expensive. Show me something else. I'll be back in a minute... Oh, no problem. Sir... how come you are here? Who is this girl? I don't know sir... ...head office sends the posters to us... ...we just put them up Why sir, for your next film? Do you have her photo or address? No address sir, but pictures... ...just a moment. The other day I was showing this catalogue to a customer... I thought I saw her picture somewhere here. Oh, there it is. Can I take these? Please return them in two days, sir. - Yeah, sure. - OK sir. Thank you. Please come again. Where is my seat? AS. Please come... Be careful. Come... HEY, you monkey, move your leg! Please come... - Hey, hi! - Hi! Hi! Hello! Hi! Hi! See the film there... Hey Raja, send special cool drinks and popcorn to A6. Put it on my tab. Why brother, has your sister come? No, it's your sister who has come. Send it, man. Right, brother. Shankranna, my girl has come to the theater. Your girl? Yes, please come inside and see her. Hey, let me go. I have to change the reel. - I don't have the time. - See, there she is! Where? Are you blind? She's sitting in A6... That must be her brother. Hey Nikki Hands off, man! OK, see you guys, We! Hey, come close to my girl again... ...and it'll be my chopper talking. Be careful! Cut it! Super sir, sir! Super sir... Can I remove the makeup? Sir, one last shot... ...please rest meanwhile. Hey, cool drinks for sir! Super sir! The fight came out well. Tell me what you want. I will get it for you. Can I get some water? Boss, can I get some water? Hey, go bring him in. OK, sir. Sir is asking you to come in. Be quick! Hello, sir. Hmmm...what's your name? Aryan, sir Bring a chair. It's OK. Hold this. Arya... Brother, chair... ...what were you doing earlier? Modeling, sir... As in, wearing clothes and walking on a stage? Yes sir. Were you getting paid? Yes sir. Do you have a girlfriend? No sir. - Seriously? - No I am not in touch with anybody. Go get ready for the shot. - Learn to fight properly. - OK sir. He is a criminal. He was involved in other cases also. He has also made threat calls before... If you ask me, he is definitely involved in this murder attempt case. What about this girl? This is where the case becomes a bit confusing. Reports and evidences show her as a suspect. Have you taken a statement from her? She didn't say much. She was present when the incident happened. She told us what happened there. I think it is all lies. I want to read the statement, please bring it. Yeah. Sir, there was a call from the lab... ...they need more samples for testing. Sir, I don't get one thing. What's the connection between the tablet and the murder attempt? God alone knows... Where can one find this "Lucia" tablet? Please look for it. See, any way you argue the law, this will be a murder. Tomorrow, he might just sit up. Who are you to say it won't happen? See, the patient is alive only because of external life support... ...and if you remove it, it's only a matter of minutes... Now the patient is alive only because of a machine. He may be in pain because of the machine. We will be responsible for that. The two of you are only talking about his body... What about his mind? OK. Should a patient in coma... ...surviving only on life support... ...be kept alive? Or should the machine support be removed... and he be allowed to die in a natural manner? What would the mindset of a coma patient be like? How will his brain be functioning? Could he be dreaming? Let's find out after a short break. No please sir, don't hit me! Sir! Where can we find this "Lucia" pill? Look sweetheart... I am going crazy over this... ...don't make me angry. It's made at a factory near Peenya... OK, make the call... Do it! And do as I said. Sir, this is Prashanth speaking... What happened to Ravi? Sir, Ravi is not in town. Sir, somebody I know wants to meet you. Why? He wants to be a distributor. Does he have money? Yes, sir. Rich party. OK, bring him near the factory. OK, sir. Hey sweetheart... you act well. Go in plainclothes to avoid suspicion. Who else will be on your team? I will go. Why do you want to take the risk? Let the police do their job. You don't worry about that. Let him come sir. I'll take care of it. Come, sweetheart, I'll buy you new clothes. Sanjay, you have to brush up your Kannada. They might get a doubt otherwise. Day after tomorrow, there is a song shooting. The director gave this... This is the song CD. These are the lyrics. Get ready. Read it. Someone's beating on the drum of my heart Words are singing in the corners of my mind I feel like I am whistling with my fingers in my mouth Jamma 'gamma 'yammma... It sounds like a mass song. Not to our taste. One minute. Did you find out anything about this girl? No managers have heard of her. Let me find out more. Nikki, hey Nikki. Get up, son! Hey, what is this? You keep sleeping everywhere. Shankranna, what's wrong with him? Sorry, I am late. Don't worry about getting your son married. I have the horoscopes of all the single-but-ready to mingle girls. Who is the boy? Here he is. Oh, dark complexion... ...not suitable for the girls in this file. They prefer only "white" boys. Education? SSLC... ...not yet passed These two files are also ruled out. These girls require boys with degrees. Salary? Three thousand... Per day? Monthly Oh, is that so? This one is also out then. Minimum ten thousand. Dowry? Don't want any...we don't take dowry. Sorry, none of these girls will get married without dowry. Sir, are there any girls without any conditions? This file I prepared yesterday. Some reject cases... See if you like any. Isn't she good looking? Yes, yes, get her married to your husband. This girl is beautiful no? Is she also looking for a husband? If her photo is here, obviously, she is looking for a husband. Not a house! Show me who that is. She is beautiful, Shankranna! Tell me about this girl. Her name is Shwetha... Born under an auspicious star... ...at 5:55 in the morning... ...no ill-omens follow her... She works in a pizza parlour. Her father owns a bakery... Thus, by god's grace, there is no hunger in her future... Her horoscope is on the computer... ...give me the boy's. I'll match them... ...we'll get them married. What do you say? Clean the place up quickly. People will start coming in. Take this. Put the yellow one there. Sir, is Shwetha here? Are you with Shwetha? Sort of... Why are you late? Oh, did you know I was coming? Is Shwetha here? OK, come. I will show you. Sir, how do I look in this getup? Please look at me. Sir, is this Shwetha's office? Get him ready quickly. Sir...Shwetha? Yes, she will come. Get ready quickly! Sir, please listen to me. Come, hero sir... Come! How's this? I have arranged all this specially for you. This item song is going to be a big hit! What? An item song? Yes. The song is nice... ...and the item is very very nice! I don't do item songs! What is this boss? You can't say things like this. Let's pack up! I won't do this. Haven't I already said I won't do item numbers? Hey, Nikki, look there. What? Just look there. Someone's beating on the drum of my heart Words are singing in the corners of my mind I feel like I am whistling with my fingers in my mouth My legs move clumsily Still I am dancing Jamma jamma jammma... Someone's beating on the drum of my heart A ladder to climb the sky A boat to sail around the earth Soil to sow my dreams I wish she could come to me just like these dreams I will sell my old cycle Be in debt forever If she favours me I'll place a cut-out of her in my tent What can I say? What shall I do? If I meet Rajnikanth on the street? I got my act right after seeing her Beauty drives boys crazy Is this right? I climbed hills and dales And swam across the ocean I conquered forts and faced the spears I have to conquer the villains and win her heart It's difficult, God it's difficult If the male ego is wounded You can't patch it like an old slipper Her kajal costs as much as my house rent This is a problematic situation This feels like a closed cauldron. Excuse me... your costume is very nice. The children really enjoyed it. It was really really nice. Can I take a picture with you? Come. Please... Thank you! I want a photo as well. Yeah, yeah, sure! One minute! Give it to me. OK, Thank you. bye! The girl is beautiful... This is my daughter. She lost her mother during childhood. I raised her alone. When she was younger, she accompanied me to the bakery. Now she doesn't like to. She works for an MNC... ...eight thousand per month... She cooks very well. Her coffee is ambrosia! Although she has no mother, you have raised her well... She's very sweet. I have raised her with loving care. She grew up dancing on my head. Be careful that she doesn't slip... What's your problem if my father-in-law is bald? Can the girl and guy talk in private? Yes, of course they can. We are also very modern. Yes, they can talk. The coffee was very good... Is it? Thank you. My neighbour made it. My father lies... I don't know how to cook. But I do! So what do you do? Shine a path to people lost in the dark... ...and put them in the right place. Meaning? In the theater... Oh a torch shiner? Correct... Shankranna runs a talkies. What does Shankranna have? Talkies! Talkies? Very funny... So you get to watch movies for free? Yes, four times a day, I watch the same movie for free. I love movies! You can make a lot of money... Nice cars, nice clothes... You can go to foreign locations... Must be really nice. But I only shine the torch... Torch shiner? You speak very well... You were pretending to be an innocent lamb all this while... Now tell me, arranged marriage or "loved" marriage? Don't tease me. It is I who came to see the girl... ...and you dyed your hair! Be quiet! Your boy is very smart. Shankranna, Let's find an auspicious time and get them married. If the girl comes home, my boy will put on weight. It's that broker's call. Are you sure you are ready to commit? Shall I fix the girl? Enough fooling around. Talk to him... Hello... hello... Loan him some money if you have to... ...and get him a house. How long can he live with those loafers? How did she agree to marry you? She's like milk... and you are like gutter water... Yes, I am ditch water and you are the shining moon. Just eat quietly... Shankranna, when can we fix the wedding for? The girl doesn't want to marry. - Let it go... - Why is that so? Why are you getting so upset? I'll find you a girl that looks like a heroine. Nikki. Why are you going away? Wait a minute... That girl is not pretty... She's just fair... Hello. Hello sir, I am Shwetha... Which Shwetha? I danced with you in that song... Tell me which song? Sir, last week... Which one is that? That one which goes "Somebody is beating the drum of my heart."

The three of you go in a car... I'll follow you. You guys go with sir. Sanjay, are you ready? Someone's beating on the drum of my heart But the beat is too strong It has begun to hurt The brain filled with her memories Torturing me to death From my eyes they overflow Drowning me in a fog. - Hello sir! - How far is it from here? Hey, how far from here? Just ahead... Nearly there sir... I'll be waiting ahead at that tea stall. Right sir... Sir, I will remain in the vehicle. My appearance can cause suspicion.

I was supposed to introduce him to sir... Right, sit down. Please come... Hey, lift...tight...very nice! Sir, someone has come... Coming... This is him sir... My name is Ravindranath... lam in the min...mineral water business... Oh welcome to my factory. Please come. Look, Mr. Ravindranath... I started this business in a tent by the roadside. Within four years, I have built a factory. Very good... Hey, "before"... Darling, "after"... Forty...forty... ...thirty six You match the skin - I will match the body... - OK, sir. Our business is a thousand times better than your mineral water business... Very creative... the products of our product! People these days care about their looks. They have to shine everywhere... in the papers, TV, internet... The wimps want six-packs... the fatties want to be size zero! And they all want quick results, which I can provide. And of course, don't even ask about sex-related products. There's too much demand. - Do these things work? - Why think about that? It's all smoke and mirrors only... People don't want the bitter truth... ...they want sugar-coated lies. Advertisement and branding! This is hundred percent profits... You can invest blindly... ...you don't worry about anything at all! Meet my wife Shobalatha... Hello! Sir, tell me sir which product would you like to begin with? Weight gain, weight loss, hair gain, hair loss... ...fairness, darkness, sexual, skin... You can start with any one of these... ...and I will give you credit benefits. This is common. I want something special. Unique. If you have it, tell me... Sir, we have launched a new product... ...we haven't obtained a license yet. It's in great demand... The guy who got you here, he made his money with that product... I want something like that. The product is called Lucia. It is a dream pill. You don't have to go to the gym and workout to lose weight. But you can dream that you have a sexy figure. Dream pill, is it even possible? Yes sir, everything is possible. You know this pill is in great demand and it works. Nobody likes their life, sir. They always wish their life was different... ...alternate reality. This pill makes it possible. Wow, very nice! Do people know about it? How do they find out about it? You sell it as a sleeping pill. They take it because it puts them to sleep... and they see the dreams that they like. And these pills are addictive. Any side effects? Don't you worry... Just moments ago, there was another attempt on Nikhil's life. Hooked up to a life support system with his life hanging by a thread... ...Nikhil was attacked right in the ICU. The attacker was a woman. Here are the details. Tchtch, it is really sad. That lady dressed up as a doctor to go in. Mr. Ravindranath, what you have is just a sample. I am sure you will come back with a large order. Because your customer's dreams... are my dreams also. I will call, sir... OK. Mr. Detective, got the updates? This girl is lying, believe me. Sanjay, she was caught red-handed. What more proof do you want? The media has got the original footage and they are playing the footage on loop. There is some connection between this case and this Lucia tablet. Hey get him into the vehicle, let us go. See, this investigation is closed. Go to your room, take some rest. In the morning, I will book your flight tickets to Mumbai. Thank you. Drop him and come. Sir, Please come I will drop you. No, I will go by myself, later. As you wish, sir. Get in... Hey get in, I say... Oh Nikki, what a surprise! What brings you here? May I come in? Oh sorry, please do come in. You have a nice house. - What are you saying? - Why? I am still a struggling actress. It is unlike your house... I mean... your palace. Why have you brought the camera? I will tell you. Can you give me some water? Yes, sure. Please sit down. No I am going to follow you. How did you find my address? If you look hard enough, even God can be found. A heroine is not hard to find. Take this. Thank you. Nikki, I am embarrassed... ...why are you filming me? You wanted to be a heroine, right? This is a small audition. Audition? Like this? I am not even dressed... You look good just like this. Please stop filming, please. I am planning to make an experimental film, will you act in it? Really? I am ready. What is the story? There is a torch shiner in a theater. He falls in love with a girl working in a pizza parlour. Why would the pizza girl love a torch shiner? Why not? Women prefer men who have better jobs than themselves. Why? Don't they prefer men with better character? Character is important... but it's not enough. Then let us write this script together. Done! Deal! Whose photo is on the mirror? Hey, you shouldn't look at all that! Dad, that guy who came home that day... - where is his house? - Who? The one the broker got home... Why? Which boy? Dad, that torch shiner in the theater... Oh that guy! Why? I don't know anything about him. Where is the broker's house? - Gowdanapalya - WW? - What are you up to? - OK, I'll be coming home late tonight. You have dinner and go to sleep. Bye! Hey Shwetha! - In the game, but a dummy player! - Mother, is Venkanna...? Venkanna is gone! He has orphaned us! In one hand a broken moon In the other a torn slice of bread To the game that these two were playing She did not come Why did she not come? She did not come Why did she not come? In the game, but a dummy player I am only a dummy player I gathered the stars in a flower bowl Before I could string them Sunlight streamed in Everything disappeared I gathered the stars in a flower bowl Before I could string them Sunlight streamed in Everything disappeared They say God has written my fate on my forehead Give me a mirror Let me read it Even if I find the mirror Everything is topsy-turvy How do I read my fate? God is a shrewd fellow In the game, but a dummy player In one hand a broken moon In the other a torn slice of bread To the game that these two were playing She did not come Why did she not come? Brother, one balcony ticket... Someone scribbled my fate My damned destiny Hey Soma, give me the tube. What should he give you? Oh, it's you! In the heat of youth, he slips from a ladder! Why are you acting like this in front of this girl? - It hurts... - Keep quiet! - You can speak to him now. - OK uncle. Please sit down. Sorry... Oh, you didn't do anything, I slipped from the ladder. That's not what I meant... That day when you came to the shop... I hurt you... I am sorry... Oh, that day... Are you in love with me? When did I say that? Oh you don't love me? Then fine. No, no. that's not what I meant... I am in love with you... Next time when I ask you something... answer me properly. Do you know any job other shining a torch? Idli-vada, chow chow bath, kesari bath, khara bath... Masala dose, plain dose, set dose, what shall I give you madam? That loafer used to charge 80 rupees for a haircut. So I thought it was very profitable and decided to join the barber shop. Tomato, beans, potatoes, drumsticks, brinjals, vegetables! No, no, no, this is fine... But being a torch shiner in this sort of theater... This talkies was built by Shankranna's father. Say "theater" and not talkies. Thetru... - No, say "theater." - Thetru... OK, let it be. Do you at least have nice clothes? Yes, I have one in red and one in pink... - I'll have to change you a bit... - Why? I can't tell my friend you are a torch shiner in a talkies. Why can't you? Shankranna, Shankranna, the projector is calling! Hey, go and change the reel I say, the alarm is ringing. Hey, I want to see as well! What is this? The carbon has to be set... What happens on this side? This is the main thing... I must firstly speak about Nikhil sir. Working with him is a matter of great pride. The heroine madam is like family to me... Look at the title... ...Rome... There is "Om" power in it... God willing... This movie has to go the Oscars! Thank you everyone... I pawned my jewellery to put 20 cores into the film... The hero is like my god... the heroine is my family also... Jai Andhra! Shooting was like a picnic... I am really excited and I am waiting for the release. Thank you so much... Welcome to all the media persons. Rome is a very different movie. I'd like to seek your support. Thank you... Please explain your relationship with her. Her name is Shwetha... I like her a lot... I love you Shwetha... Applause...Everyone! Madam, can I take a picture of yours? Why mine? You look very fresh... Super! Please remove your jacket. It'll look hot... Beautiful, madam, beautiful! Beauty ma'am! Stop this! Wear this jacket... Why? Only you should see it, is it'? Nikki, Nikki... ...what's wrong with you? Nikki, let's go... Nikki, stop it! Sir, sir, sir, don't take it personally... You are like my god sir... Sir, I was not there... ...had I been there, this wouldn't have happened... Please pardon him, sir... it's just his hot bloodymindedness... The Chamber should ignore this. Look, look at what the media is reporting. He just slightly pushed him, that's all... but the media is hyping it up... Sir, I will call you back. Nikki, where are you going? Shwetha's house... You have to go apologize on live TV, come... Why should I? What does that mean? I don't need the industry... the industry needs me! If they need me, they'll come here... The one you beat up is no ordinary guy. Damn...he thinks it's a game... Hello! - Nikki! - Sir! Here, sir... OK, sit down... You sit too, sir. You have a lot experience in diverse fields. Good, very good. - Do you like cinema? - Yes sir... Why so? - Because cinema is... - Speak in English! Sir...err... ...English...how? Cinema..."Ci"... ...look...looking... Hmm...OK... Ma... ..."mother"... Like mother. Yes sir. Cinema is like my mother. You mean cinema is like mother for you. Yes... OK, how do you know Shwetha? - Lover, sir! - Oh? She love me too much sir. Three much... Four much sir! Much, much, much...sir! OK, Nikki. Sir, I have my own battery with me. Battery? What is it? Battery... ...click, click? - ...light! - You mean torch... OK. Come let's go. What happened, girl? How much will they offer? Did I tell you not to speak in English? Oh, he doesn't understand Kannada... ...if I speak in Kannada, he speaks in English. Let that go. There's an English class close to home... I'll register you there. Oh no, that can't be done. Shankranna's talkies is great. Do as I say. Got it? Can we tell my mother of the marriage? What? Whose marriage? What are you saying? Our marriage of course! When did I say I'll marry you? First, you learn English, get a job... Then we'll see... Listen...don't shave again. Hey, what is all this new stuff? Oh hi! Hi, aren't you ready yet? No, someone has come... - Who is it? - Come, come... Aryan, look who has come! - Are you shocked? - Sir, it's you! I am so happy to see you again sir. Nikki, meet Aryan... ...he used to model with me... - Shwetha, I have met him before. - Oh? I have already made one film with him. Oh great! Nikki, Aryan is making debuting as a hero... He wants me as the heroine...so... Very lucky to meet you, sir! Sir, we definitely need your support... You are our inspiration. Good, good, Arya, best of luck. But... ...Shwetha cannot act in your film. Nikki? Shwetha, it's getting late. You should get ready. Arya, you please contact our manager... ...he will help you with everything. I will personally come to the audio release... - Sir...but...Shwetha... - OK, carry on then. The film will certainly run for 100 days. Don't worry! Best of luck! Shwetha, get ready! Nikki, what are you doing? I want to do this film! Why did you speak that way? I'll get you a better film, don't worry! You keep saying this, Nikki. I love acting... please don't do this to me! When the time comes you'll understand. Shwetha, we are already running late... ---get ready quickly. English has five vowels... ".3, 9, I; o! u' P...U...T...put! Why do you fear it? Just read, I say. C...U...T...kut! Look, uncle...he says "kut"! I go by bus to save petrol money... and send him to English class... ...and he goes there and sleeps! Rascal! What's wrong with you? Learning English is good for the talkies too. You can converse with couples in English... First, get some people in here... ...then we'll see. Her plan is to make me learn English and send me to work in a multiplex... - Multiplex? - Yes...there, you have to know English to just shine the torch. If I go, who will shine the torch here? Our canteen Soma can't even count puffs... ...will he count people and shine a torch? Hey, get going! Get her some juice... Alright, alright, I'll get her juice. Hey, get going I say... The two of you are a pain...l won't go to any English talkies! I am telling you now itself! I ask him to learn something and... Uncle, you said three thousand per month. But is it enough? If he gets a good job, won't you be happy for him? In running the talkies, I did not think about Nikki at all... Correct, my child. You do what you think is right. It's enough that the talkies has consumed me... Let Nikki at least live well... ...as you say, child. Thank you uncle! Hey please listen to me. I will do as you say. Don't be angry. Please... Please listen, I will learn English...l will work in a multiplex... Auto! Auto! Sir, will you come to Malleswaram? - Hey...hey... - Oh, oh, the auto is gone! - Auto! - What the fuck! Hey, come on, I am begging you... - What did you say? - I said I'll learn English. No... what the...? Oh that, the students in the school keep saying it... What else did you hear? What the fuck, bloody fucking, assholes, nonsense, idiots... Look, aren't I learning English for you? You, on the other hand... - Hi Shwetha! - Hi! - How are you? - I am good. How are you? This is Nikki. Nikki, my friend... Hi Nikki! How are you, dude? Come, I'll drop you... - OK... sure! - It's OK, come on... OK, I'll leave then. Bye! You said you would never step into such a theater! How are you? Are you married? Forget me, who's the guy'? A torch shiner? No, no, theater... owner actually... Really? He looks like a torch shiner in a theater! Hello...shut up! OK... I just wasted time building my body in the gym. You only like local boys. Will you shut up? Or shall I get down? OK, I'll shut up. - Sir, please stop to the left... - Why? We folks have to work my dear. Are we theater owners like your lover? Enough...enough of your teasing... Just a minute... - Hi Sabrine! How are you? - Good! How're you? I am doing good. Are your friends here? Cathy...Bianca, come here! Hi, so you girls are ready? We'll start at 7 tomorrow... I am getting a jeep. And I'll be driving. Oh you'll be driving? Nice!

Actually...l have to visit my grandfather for two or three days... So go and come. You don't have to tell me everything. Shwetha, you misunderstand me. I told you not to act in films for your own good. OK, Nikki, I'll see you soon, bye! I love you! Bye, Nikki... Hey, it's OK, don't worry! He'll understand. I don't like lying to Nikki... He will like it after the shooting is done. Stop worrying... ...Shwetha... Thank you... Coming...coming... Who the hell is that? How long will you keep sleeping? What...why did you come? Why, can't I come? Yes you can...that's Maruti... Hmm...good morning. Where are the others? They've all gone home for the festival... OK, listen, we have to go to your village for a couple of days. Go get ready... These clothes are all washed right? To our village? Why? I'll tell you on the way. Get ready quickly... I have work at the talkies. I have told Shankranna. I have to go to the English class as well. You don't have to the English class anymore, OK? If you don't like it, then I don't like you doing it, OK? What happened to you? Has some spirit possessed you? Enough, get ready soon. My damned fate! Because of her, my "piracy" is all gone... Hey, aren't you ashamed of sleeping only in your shorts? Take these...

What happened to him? Why are you laughing, idiot? Shwetha... Shwetha! ...with a sexy number "A for apple B for ball"... Gorgeous Shwetha has entered the film industry... ...this song was recently shot at Guhantara resort... She is good... ...she has a future! ...she has danced boldly with actor Aryan... Come, come sit, I say... People who have seen the song... ...are fondly calling them Sandalwood's hot pair" ...they claim to have pictured the song in a rich manner... and say it's on par with Bollywood movies... Why are you so dull'? Angry because she didn't listen to you? Why should she listen to you anyway? She has talent. She will rise... Hey Nikki, come here...sit... Sign up for the new picture. I don't know about you... but if I don't have a picture in hand, I get bored. Thirty years of working in films... ...I feel I have no other life. Even as a child, you would laugh freely only with me. My daughter gave birth to a child... ...but no one told me. Let it go. Sign up for a couple of pictures... I always wanted to build a talkies in our village in your father's name. Pick up the phone! Pick it up and speak! Hello, who is it? Where's the money? Last time we used dummy bullets... ...this time it will be real bullets. Hey, shut up and keep the phone down. You'll get no money. Don't play with us. We won't stop at anything! What will you do? What the hell will you do? Do whatever! Threaten us, will you? Here, drink some water... I feel very tired, I will leave... And... don't stay so depressed... Your father has made money. See, this time and age won't come again. Nikki, when you go inside, be careful...don't go alone... Take some of the boys with you... Call me...Don't sit and brood all night, get some sleep. Shankranna, Shankranna...where are you, my dear? The foreign girls have given us a foreign brand! Two pegs and you will sail away... Let me tell you the story! Forty two years of service and... I've never missed changing the reel even once. Roll it up quickly! It's getting late. Shankranna! Hello... Please come... the great all-in-one star Nikhil! Finally you picked our call... ...it is our fortune. We were intending to kidnap your lover... She was in a film shoot... ...so we didn't disturb her... Instead we got this one. We have given him food, coffee and juice... and taken great care of him. Tell him how well we have looked after you, sir! Wait for Nikhil's signal, all of you. Police, CCB, CBl...no one around right? First floor sir! Kempraju, anything? Look Nikhil... Why all this drama? Times have changed. This filmy kidnapping... you bringing money in a bag... ...it's so boring! You could have just made monthly bank payments. You did not listen to me. That's why so much drama. Look, what a waste of time for both of us. Charge! Nikhil, you are a real hero! Thank you... The guy who attacked me last time... he was around here somewhere... ...he must have escaped. Don't worry about them Nikhil. They're just contract killers... They only work when they get money. We'll take care of them. There's no danger for you. Shankranna! Hmm...are we there already? Why have you brought me to the village? Come... ...it's a long time since I saw the family... Hi Chikkana, doing fine? Shankranna. Why? What happened? Why are you looking so depressed? What happened? I am sorry... I was late in coming back... Sorry Shankranna... I don't want to lose you. Sorry... Everything is fine now, don't worry. They wouldn't have done anything to me. No! Enough... Please stay here... Hey... I'll thrash you... Come on, let's go home... You have taken care of me since my birth... ...you should relax now at least... Stop this nonsense! Get in, get into the vehicle. We'll start a film today itself. You have lost your head sitting at home! Come on, let's go! Shankranna! I will leave. You take care of yourself, Hey Nikki... Listen to me... ...Don't leave Nikki. At least have lunch and go! Don't go. Fine, it's my fault. We won't talk about films. Nikki...Nikki... Seriously? Five of you stay in this room'? Isn't it difficult? Did you really want this kind of life? Go to the village, and take care of your land and parents. OK? Get married and have children! The life of a theater owner... is like the films he runs in the theater... No one knows what will happen. These people are not good. They may do anything to you. Five guys have come... How will you pay their salaries? Put it in the next month's account... OK...what is this print molding here? Didn't I tell you I made a picture once? That one will never see the light of day. Toss it out as scrap. The audience didn't see it... ...at least let the cockroaches get a viewing. What are you doing Nikki'? Shankranna made a film once. It was never released. I will release it. I too feel the pain of Shankranna's death. But I don't think he would want you to continue here... I know him better than you. Try and understand what I am saying! There is nothing here. Improving this place would a waste of time... He had no one but me. I would have never left the talkies and gone. - It's you who upset things... - What? Me? If I hadn't gone with those foreign women... I would have been around to help him! I sent you with those girls so you could learn English... and get a good job! Look, I don't care what happens. I will make Shankranna's dreams come true. Look this is how I am. I can only call a talkies talkies... and not a theater... If you want to stay, you can... ...if not... If not? You don't like me. You want someone educated, English-speaking... ...well-dressed and with a good income. Not me! Or is it that... ...you don't want me? Don't you have a girl? Why do you bother with that run-down theater? .And risk your girl's life too? The sky fell to the ground And the boat of my dreams drowned The Earth turned barren And my dreams lie shattered My life itself is pawned My dignity shamed on the streets My memories sold for nothing Left clutching nothing but straws Why? Isn't this your second attempt to kill him? Will you sign a confession? Can you tell me anything about this pill? What is this Lucia? It's a dream pill. That I know. But what is a dream pill? How does it work? It's a cheesy name for a pill actually. It helps you with lucid dreaming. So...lucid, Lucia. What is lucid dreaming? Look, we all dream right? We all have dreams which we often don't remember or care about. But, lucid dreaming, it's a different thing... Basically you get to chose who you want to be in your dreams... ...so you can construct your dreams and enjoy them. Why is it harmful? It's not harmful as long as you do it without taking these... What do these pills do? They have a chemical that makes you remember your dream like you lived it. Every time you go back to sleep your dream starts playing like a film. You can do all those things in a dream which you can't do in real life. Hello? Yeah, you are right. About what? That girl is lying... She thinks if the case is solved quickly... the court may grant euthanasia. I can give you more information... Please come, I'll make arrangements for it. Please buy the ticket brothers... only 30 rupees! Hey Nikki, how are you? Oh come, please... Thanks for coming. There's no one who I can call my own. Shankranna...his picture... ...one time... ...it must run... People inside... ...a lot of people must come...full full. ...Shankranna's dream... ...must come true. Hi, Anna? Thank you... Why are there no servants? I sent them off. Why? I didn't feel like having anyone around... I like being alone. Nikki... I am sorry. Shwetha, you have done what you felt like doing. You don't have to be sorry. I still love you... Sorry about that... it will heal quickly. Don't worry! Why don't you like me acting? I have to know. I can't explain what or why. One day you will find out for yourself. We will meet then. OK? Thank you Are you in an illusion or is the illusion within? Are you within the body Or is the body within you? Are you in a dream Or is the dream within you? Are you in the intoxication Or is the intoxication within? Are you in the whirlpool of love That splits body and mind? The moment you left, My heart is filled with your memories Only you fill up this chest of memories See that single teardrop In the eye of that lonely cloud, my beloved. Who is that singing songs of heartbeats Even though it cannot be heard or seen? This love is an illusion, It hurts even when you are happy The shadow of loneliness Haunts me day and night The word love spells trouble When will you come? It feels like my heart is stopped The moment you vanished, My heart yearns for your presence My soul yearns to reconcile and merge with you This is a boat without an oarsman And the agony of a lonely journey It is a game of shadow boxing I pray this gets over now Are you in an illusion or is the illusion within? Are you within the body or is the body within you Are you in the whirlpool of love That splits body and mind? Are you in a dream Or is the dream within you? Are you in the intoxication Or is the intoxication within? Love found in an intoxicated dream Is it doomed to fail? That looks so cool! And the colors! So amazing! So what? Do you like it? Tell me! Do you like it? Thank you! Thank you! Don't cry! You must be happy! Don't cry! Shankranna... I have readied the talkies. I have released your picture... Namaste... while Gandhinagar mourns that there is no Kannada audience... ...a miracle is occurring here. Who could imagine that a movie made 15 years ago... ...would be released in such a grand fashion. The fortune of this ruined theater has been changed by four foreign girls... Come, let's speak to them. - Hello... - Hi! Do you know Kannada? A little... Why are you interested in keeping this theater alive? For our friend Nikki... Hmm...let's find out who Nikki is...come. Where can we find Nikki? Nikki's not here. A customer has come for you... Let's look for Nikki, right after this small break! Garlic parmesan bread sticks with Italian seasoning and one more... Spring fling regular with olives and corn and a lemon mojito...please. One minute... Will you... ...will you marry me? What did you say? Will you mm...marry me? I don't know English. Look girl... if you and your baldy dad stay in our talkies... ...and make some snacks... it will help us... We all can be happy... ...what do you say? Oh, is that all? Also what I said in English... and I will wear clothes the way you want me to... Just say yes girl... If you go back to being how you were... I will say yes... Yes, he's inside... I will finish him off! Err... Nikki... ...hi... How are you? I am so glad you called me... I have missed you... I don't know if you still love me anymore... But I still do... Once in a while, I start to doubt... I wonder if this is really a dream... ...what do you say? It may be a nightmare...isn't it Nikki? If it was only a dream, would we be speaking like strangers? It's to end this nightmare that I called you. What do you mean? We were both so happy in real life... ...it's all my fault. I remember you saying I will find out for myself why I shouldn't be an actress. I think I know why... Shwetha, I love you... Don't ever leave me ever again... I am sorry, in this game of dreaming, I have hurt you a lot. I too have hurt you... Close your eyes... What? Close your eyes... What do you feel right now? I feel like going far away with you on a drive... Nikki... The confession papers are ready... ...sign them. You may be right Sanjay... ...but how do you prove it in the court? They'll ask for strong evidence. Who will believe in a dream pill? This report will not work. Look at the girl's statement. Read what Nikhil said before he jumped... "All this is a bad dream... we both were very happy in real life." Hah! Tell me, is there any logic to this? After all, these are cinema folk, who can believe them... The court will decide tomorrow on allowing Nikhil euthanasia. The entire film industry and Nikhil's fans are all awaiting the verdict. Suvarna news has exclusive footage of an interview with Nikhil. We feel this is the appropriate moment to air this interview. Welcome to the Suvarna News Studio, Nikhil. Thank you, Gaurish. When I see you, I feel like asking a lot of questions... a lot of questions come to mind... But, importantly... why do you always wear these black glasses? Gaurish, you may know that... I was involved in an accident as a boy... Yes... you lost your parents in the accident. I hurt my head in the accident. I haven't been able to see any colors since... Too much light hurts my eyes... Oh, but no one knows of this Nikhil! I too did not announce this... To all our viewers, the common man, and even me... A star's life is a big dream... You are a big star... What do your dreams look like? In my dreams, I want to be an ordinary man, Gaurish. Common man... ...who according to you is a common man? Mmm...l want to get lost among all these people. I want eat pani puri alone on the road. I want to wait for a bus at a bus stop. So you can't do these things because you are a star... I did not focus on being a star, Gaurish. If my dad had not made money, if I was an ordinary man... perhaps I too would dream of being a star... This means, you have everything in life, but you don't want any of it... I have everything... but no experience of the struggle to get everything... So Nikhil, who are your best friends? Look Gaurish, a star has no "best" friends. Everyone wants my affection... Whatever I do, they say I am right. Who is lying? - I love you... - Who is telling the truth? I still love you... Everyone wants the star Nikhil, not me... When I was young, I was in an accident... Did he have insomnia? He was taking medication... But, it didn't help him in any way sir... Sir, your problem is not regarding sleep... You see, you don't even know you are sleeping... You are unable to dream, but I have a solution for that. What was Lucia's drug procedure? You need to write down your dreams... The more you write them down... the dreams will continue... You will not be able to differentiate dreams and reality... The mind has to believe that your dream life is your real life. I raised my gun, but he had already jumped off the terrace... No one is ready to believe me, sir! When did you last supply the drug? Six months ago... Hello sir... May I come in? Namaste, sir! Ninety lakh damned fools in Bangalore! Like sheep in a pen! Me, I am another innocent lamb My name is Nikki. Not lkki! Nikki! Life is great, but I can't sleep... Do you want to save him? Nikhil, please share with us one of your favourite dreams. I have a dream that comes very often... ...in which I am a torch shiner in a theater. An usher? Yes... That is your favourite dream? See, Gaurish... ...everybody goes to the theater. The torch shiner there shows them the path. He takes them to their seat. But nobody notices his face. It is as if he is invisible right in the middle of the crowd. Well said. What else happens in your dream? Thank you. Where is my seat? Torch shiner? There is true love. A torch shiner like me... There is a struggle to win that love. Shouldn't dream about someone like you. I like that struggle. Or is it that you don't want me? The girl in your dreams, have you met her in life? Hmm... Nikki, wake up... It's getting late... ...we have to go to the talkies... Nikki, how long will you sleep? Get up! There's a new film in the theater... We need to go early. Get up! OK, fine. Get ready quickly... Six years of marriage, and you haven't changed a bit... Go... Dad... Nikki, Nikki, what dreams did you have today? I was lying on a hospital bed. Was I there in your dreams? You were holding my hands and crying, why? Take this and feed Chinnu. You have to drop her to the school today. Chinnu, come darling, I will feed you. Just a little... Shwetha, Shwetha... Take this sir. It's empty. It's completely safe... Sorry, sorry... sorry! - Come, come! - Sorry I am late. I am ravenous! Give me what you have prepared. No. Where is Nikki? Hey Nikki, come. I am very hungry! Nikki, I have a surprise for you. Open it. Oh... Jane's pizza?
