(INDISTINCT VOICES OVER RADIO) (RADIO SIGNALS SCRAMBLING) MALE NEWSCASTER: Others are staying put... FEMALE NEWSCASTER: People are preparing to hunker down, bracing for what could be devastating winds. (NEWSCASTER VOICES OVERLAPPING) (RADIO SIGNALS SCRAMBLING) FEMALE NEWSCASTER: But if you are going to leave, leave now. The latest update from the Hurricane Center puts Charley on a fast track for the Tampa area. (INDISTINCT VOICES OVER RADIO) (WIND RUSTLING) MALE NEWSCASTER 1: We have heard reports of extremely long lines at gas stations, and we do know that many are running low on fuel. MALE NEWSCASTER 2: ...bracing for what could be devastating winds. The emergency workers of this area are designating Red Cross and Salvation Army... FEMALE NEWSCASTER: I-4 and I-75 at this time are clear. Now, you shouldn't get too secure with that because, you know, as this progresses those, uh, roads are going to get very, very busy. My suggestion... LAURIE: Okay. Let's put all this stuff in as fast as we can, before it starts coming down, all right? (SIGHS) Okay. BOY: Hey, Zach. My mom's all freaked. We're evacuating to my uncle's in Huntsville. I wanna stay here. It might be cool, you know? Yeah, well, we're staying. You're not evacuating? LAURIE: No. I'd rather be in our safe room in my own home, than stuck on the highway with a million other folks. We sat out a half dozen of these things. FEMALE NEWSCASTER: Mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for all residents of the Florida Keys and people are packing up and heading to the mainland. Thousands of cars, many towing boats crammed the highway... (LAURIE SIGHS) What now? We wait it out. MALE NEWSCASTER 1: Latest update from the Hurricane Center puts Charley on a fast track for the Tampa area. Though they do caution that it wouldn't take much to force a deviation anywhere along that trajectory. MALE NEWSCASTER 2: Extremely long lines at gas stations. And we do know that many are running low on fuel. (MULTIPLE NEWSCASTERS OVERLAPPING) (CLAPPING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (WIND WHOOSHING) (WIND HOWLING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (HORNS BLARING) (WIND WHOOSHING) (CLATTERING) MALE NEWSCASTER 1: There's a staggering number of people left homeless. Shelters are packed... The volunteers are doing the best they can with the supplies they have. Hurricane Charley made a last minute right turn, veering 70 miles to the south of Tampa Bay. The communities around Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte saw the worst of it. So far 16 people are dead. What's going on? Just another day in paradise. ...hundreds are missing. When it comes to homes at least 3,000 conventional homes and 9,000 mobile homes are destroyed. At least 20,000 people are homeless and thousands are trying to find food and water in the merciless heat. One relief worker described it to me as organized chaos. There are so many needs out there for people right now, and patience and provisions are both in short supply. What these people want, need desperately is ice and clean water. The American Red Cross and other disaster relief agencies are setting up collection points across Florida. If you'd like to help, you can take your donations to any one of the locatis scrolling at the bottom of your screen. We should give them some of the water we got. Oh, we could do that. Zach, please wash up. I'll bet everybody in the neighborhood has lots of water like us. Tons of emergency stuff, too. I should go around and ask them if they want to donate... Well, I wouldn't do it. Right now people are off to work. Why don't you give them some notice? Collect it on Saturday. People work on Saturday, too. You could make flyers. Tell them to sit stuff out on the porch if they're not home. Yeah, you should help him with that, Kel. I'm busy. You're busy? Come on, help him out. You two kids don't do anything together anymore. I'm not a kid anymore, in case you haven't noticed. Hey, Mom, Kelley. Where's that list of emergency supplies we had? We can put it on the flyers, so people know what's needed. Zach, hands. Wash 'em. Now. (GARAGE DOOR OPENING) (BOYS TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Kelley, come on. Let's do this. BOY: Hey, Zach. You wanna play some Horse? Uh, I gotta go pick up the hurricane stuff first, but it won't take long. So after, okay? Your loss, dude. Cool. Kelley! Right here. Let's do this. Brenda and I are going to the mall. Oh, no. No, I'm sorry, you're not. You gotta keep an eye on your little brother while I go check my property. Good luck. Wha... Kelley, look at this! Oh, my gosh. This is so cool. I hit the jackpot. Yeah, over here, too. Hey, what did you find? Wow. Look at all that. Good for you. You know, it's pretty hot out here. Maybe you shouldn't leave that in the sun. Why don't you, uh, load up the van, I'll change and then we can go right over to the collection center. That's not all, Mom. What do you mean? Hit the remote. Okay. (CLEARS THROAT) Okay. We are going to have to make more than one trip. Hey! Hey! Look who's here with another load. It's the Z-Man. What's up, dude? Good to see you. You, too. Thanks, son. You're picking the cupboards bare, huh? How many loads is that? Uh... Oh, I want you to meet a friend of mine. This is Ashley Legare, a reporter. Hi. Nice to meet you. So, young man, I hear you're personally responsible for bringing in two truckloads of relief supplies? Well, actually three. But my mom and my sister helped. Excuse me, what... What's going on? Oh, I'm sorry. We're with Channel 5. Are you his mother? Yes. Well, we thought it would be nice to do an interview about you and your family and all the good work you're doing here. Um, well... (STAMMERING) It was Zach's idea. So, you know, you should just talk to him. ASHLEY: All right. Okay. Where you wanna do this? ASHLEY: Well, how did all of this get started? Well, we were watching the news one day, I guess, and how it missed us, Hurricane Charley. So, I was thinking of all those people in Punta Gorda. You know, they lost like everything. So, we made flyers and I got my little red wagon. This wagon my mom got e when I was little. You know? So, people just... There was... There was donations and we brought them here. ASHLEY: Three truckloads, and he's not done yet, says young Zach Bonner. Oh, I can't watch it. I acted like a dumb kid. That's okay. You are a kid. As for the dumb part... LAURIE: Kelley. It's still good, Zach. People see you on TV, they might give you more stuff. Yeah. That'd be cool. KELLEY: Uh, I don't know about that. I think you pretty much played out the neighborhood. Yeah, you're right. But we could do other neighborhoods around here. Come on, let's go make some more flyers. KELLEY: Mom. I do not have time to go traipsing after him all over Florida. I have a life, you know! Let me see. Where did I put that box? Here it is. Do I really have to get rid of all this stuff? I told you, you can only take half that stuff. There won't be room in the apartment. Thank you very much. Oh. Hey, hold on! I have some more stuff for you. I've got this water purifier. My husband got it for our camping trip together. I'm sure someone could find some use for it. Sure, I guess. Oh! Don't you just hate moving? (SIGHING) Oh, I hate it. And we're moving to a smaller place. House load of stuff in a tiny apartment. I don't know. I bet you some of those hurricane kids would like a Rock Band. Oh, for sure. Here, take the box. ZACH: Thanks. Wait. Not that. My dad gave me that. I have a tent. That would be handy, wouldn't it? Uh, yeah. Those poor people. I hear some of them lost everything. Oh, they sure did. Tell your husband get a checkup. Well, it's just me and my two kids. Uh, lost my husband. Motorcycle accident. Cancer. Six months ago. I'm... I'm sorry. So you manage with no, uh, father in the house? Um, yeah. I mean, we get by. I'm in real estate and I manage some property, so... We do okay. (CHUCKLES) Well, get a checkup. My late husband, he, uh... Well, you never know you're gonna get sick until it's too late. Right? Um, this is very generous. I appreciate it. Oh, it's my pleasure. Well, we better get going, Zach. Okay? Okay. Again, thank you so much. Okay. Good luck. Good luck to you. Well, you can't be doing that. You gotta wait in the car. Huh? Where's Mr. Parrish? Never heard of him. You gotta sit in the car. No minors allowed around the loading dock. Mom. Excuse me, what's going on here? No kids around the loading dock. It's the rules. But Zach's helped unload before. I don't care about that. Lady. He's brought in 27 freaking loads here. Helped unload 26 of them his own self. I don't make the rules, lady. I just enforce them. That is just the most ridicu... But it's the rules. It's the rules, so... Go wait in the van, Zach. Kelley, you and I will unload the rest of this. KELLEY: That uptight, anal-retentive bureaucrat. You give little people a little power and you just... Okay. All right, all right. Zach, you okay? Come on. Are you gonna let Princess Red Tape ruin your day? You've been doing a good thing. Is it 'cause you didn't get a high-five and a great big attaboy from Mr. Parrish? 'Cause you didn't get to be on TV again? Is that why you've been doing this? (SIGHS) You know what? We're gonna go on a road trip. Wait. What? Where? Right now? All right, just calm down. You'll see. No! I can't go anywhere, I gotta go home. Why? I have a date. Oh. A date? With who? That Murch kid again? What? Uh... Somebody else. I already told you. Oh. But he's picking me up in, like, an hour and I have to go home and get ready. Okay, okay. Then it'll just be Zach and me. Yes. Road trip, Zach? Yeah? Okay. (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) WOMAN: Come over here for a second, please. LAURIE: I thought you should see where all that stuff you collected was going. Some of these folks have been here for weeks. Can you believe that? But they are being fed, clothed, taken care of. But people like you, if you hadn't done what you did, it would have been a whole lot worse for them. ZACH: It's so... So... I know. Breaks your heart. From one day you're just living your life and then... (SNAPS FINGERS) Bam! Something happens. And the next thing you know you're... You're struggling with things that you always took for granted. How am I gonna feed my kids? Put clothes on their back, roof over their heads. It's just the simplest, little thing can become a mountain that you have to climb. Hey. Hi. I have my own room. Where's your home? Ain't there no more. I'm sorry. (GUNS FIRING IN VIDEO GAME) (CHARACTER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Can I get a new memory card for my Battle Box? We're not gonna buy anything new. Not for a while. I lost my job today. You got fired? No. They closed the bank. You know, my manager came in this morning and said that they would cease operations by the end of the day. And then, they just shut it down. I mean, the whole branch. Locked everything up and sent us all home. You'll get another job. Hmm? You'll get another job. I will. Absolutely. I will. (VIDEO GAME SOUNDS CONTINUE) (EXPLOSION IN VIDEO GAME) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (DOOR OPENING) Ooh. Hey, made curfew with time to spare. Give Kelley an "attagirl". (CHUCKLES) For doing what you're supposed to do? (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) Now what's the gnome doing? I took him to see some of the folks he's been helping. A bunch of people made homeless by the hurricanes. Seems he took it to heart. Yeah. (SIGHS) He does that. (SIGHS) So... How was your date? So... His name is Ian. And... (SIGHING) I don't know. He's super cute. We like the same books and movies and music and... I don't know. (LAUGHS) I gotta call Brenda. Well, I thought she was with you. No, she was. But, you know... I gotta give her the post-date review. (CHUCKLES) LAURIE: Yep. Caulk the shower, guest bath, that piece of molding. Master bedroom, loose vents, living room. Uh-huh, and when the punch list is done then you'll get the balance. Please hurry, okay? I need to lease that place ASAP. What... Okay, just hang on one second, please. Yes, honey. I know what I'm gonna do. About what? I'm gonna help homeless kids. You... Um... LAURIE: No, I said when you complete the punch list then you'll get the payment. Well, I'm sorry, but otherwise what incentive do you have to finish? (TOYS LAUGHING) ZACH: They're all so expensive. Well, if you insist on including a toy, why don't you just leave out some of the other things? No, Mom, I don't want to. Hey, do you want some cheese with that whine? Just skip the toy, it's not a big deal. No. The toy's important. I've been thinking... If you have nothing, no home, nothing, then a toy would mean a lot. Well, then it doesn't matter if it's cheap or expensive. Just has to be a good toy. Okay? Okay. (SIGHS) Uh, excuse me. Do you have any cheap toys? How cheap? Real cheap. (SIGHS) What is this, like a birthday present for somebody you don't like? No. It's gotta be a great toy. But I need a lot of them. Couple hundred. I have money, but not a lot. Okay. (EXHALES) Let's go with the classics. Follow me. How about a yo-yo? Yo-yo's are nice. How much? Well, the Duncan Butterfly is $4.99. But the Duncan Imperial, a very good yo-yo, is $3.49. I don't know. LAURIE: Um... Sir, we are, um... We're trying to put together these, sort of, um, care packages for homeless kids, and they've got, um, some food in them, hygiene kits, underwear. Maybe candy, something to read and, uh... And a toy if we can afford it. A toy for sure. You see, Zach here has been raising the money all by himself. He's been collecting donations. Selling bottles of water at various events, things like that. Well, no kidding. My brother goes homeless on me every once in a while. He's, uh... He's a bit schizo. Well, actually he's full schizo. And every once in a while he stops taking his meds and he finds himself back out on the streets and I go looking for him. (SIGHING) I've seen some stuff. So, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you, young man. I am gonna sell you these yo-yo's at wholesale, and just for nothing I'm gonna throw in a gross of Gertie Balls. Gertie Balls are cool. Yeah, you bet Gertie Balls are cool. What's a wholesale? Wholesale... What it cost me. It's about a buck per unit, per yo-yo. I like wholesale. (BOTH LAUGHING) Deal. Deal. All right, now what are you gonna put all those things in? I can give you a couple of bags. Did you remember your wallet, Son? Yes, Mom. Good boy. Backpacks? Backpacks. Every kid needs a backpack. Something to put their stuff in. Backpacks, too? Okay, I'm gonna need to see your 501(c)(3). My what? WARREN: Your 501(c)(3)? You're gonna need one of those if you're gonna call yourself a charity. And I'm gonna need to see one if I'm gonna get an okay from corporate. Oh. Okay, I can do that. (SIGHS) WARREN: Well, okay. You go do that. And I'll get your stuff together here and you come back and get it. Okay, thanks. Right. Ask for me. Hey, Mom. Hey! What you doing? (GROANS) Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Your father used to handle all this. He used to handle everything, really. How was school? Same old, same old. Mrs. Moon is taking us on a field trip to the Museum of Science and Industry. Hey! That's gonna be fun. Yeah, and you need to sign this permission slip. Okay. And I need $25 for tickets, lunch, and everything. You want something to drink? I'm okay. $25? Yeah. Um... You might have to be sick that day. Really? Sorry. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (WHISPERS) Don't get it. Jim. Hey, Mr. Deason. Hi, Jimmy. Mrs. Craig. Hi, Mr. Deason. I'm sorry. Mr. Deason, I am trying. I really am. But my unemployment just ran out and my part-time job... I hardly make enough money to put food on the table. If you could just give me a little more time. It isn't me, Mrs. Craig. It's, uh... I mean, all I do is fix toilets and collect the rent. It's my bosses. I mean, they're on my back constantly. It's like, uh... Maybe if you could put some money on the back rent. Do you think you could give me to the end of the week to put some money together? I'm sorry, there's really nothing I can do about that. Mr. Deason, do you know anybody who wants a TV? It's a big screen. It's practically brand new. Well, I don't know anyone, but I can ask around. Okay. Mmm-hmm. Uh, we're here about a 501(c)(3). Did you get the instructions? Yes, ma'am, we did. And, um, they just served to confuse us more, if you know what I mean. There's an 800 number helpline. Did you call it? Yes, ma'am, we did call that helpline and, uh, there was quite a wait and when we finally did get a human being on the line, um, how shall I put it, that human being seemed just as confused as we were. So... I don't know what to tell you then. You want to establish a tax-free exempt status, you have to apply like everyone else. Well, ma'am, what we were hoping is that somebody could just walk us through the application. What? There's no one here who does that. That's what the 800 number is for. And the instructions. Right. The instructions. Okay, well, thank you for your help. Wait. Ma'am. You know any kids? Of course. I have three grandchildren. Well, I'm trying to help kids. Kids without homes. You? You're trying to help them? Yep. This 501(c)(3) thing is for me. You see, um, Zach here has been collecting donations for hurricane victim relief for most of the year. And now he wants to do the same thing for homeless kids. But I need this 501(c)(3) thing... Yeah. To make it all legal. This 501(c)(3) thing. (CHUCKLING) What if one of your grandchildren was homeless? Oh, don't try and soft soap me, mister. How would you like to go to lunch with me? Hey, Mom. Where were you? I was worried. Oh, um, I sold the rest of my games and those DVDs. I got over $40. Oh, sweets. Listen, I need you to go and pack a bag. Are we going on a trip? We have to move. Tonight. And we have to be very quiet about it. We can't let Mr. Deason see us. Why? Where are we going? Are we going to a hotel? We don't have enough money for a hotel, we're gonna have to stay in the car. In the car? It's just for a little while. Till I can figure out some things. Well, what about school? You go to school like you always do. Now go pack. Suitcase on the bed. What about all my stuff? My computer, my Gamebite, my stuff. We're gonna have to leave a lot of the stuff behind. I'm leaving a note for Mr. Deason, telling him he can sell it to make up for what we owe... Sell my stuff. No! I am leaving a lot of my stuff behind, too. Most of my clothes. Now go on. Mom, it's not fair. I already moved and I lost all my... No, it's not fair. It's not fair. I'm sorry. I'm begging you. Please just go and pack a bag. (INAUDIBLE) (KIDS TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (INAUDIBLE) Look at their faces. (KIDS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) It's just like watching Christmas morning. (BOTH LAUGHING) We cannot thank you enough for everything, Miss Bonner. Oh, well, it was all Zach's doing. Well, Zach, we thank you. You did a good thing here. Thank you. (SIGHS) I just wish we had room for them all. Well, thank you again, so much. LAURIE: Oh, it was a pleasure meeting you. It was nice meeting you, too. Zach, thank you. All Zach's doing? Really? Mom, what am I? Hired help? Well, I just meant it was his idea, that's all. (EXHALES) Don't get all huffy. You got that boy, and Zach has this. Whoa! Not the same thing. Not even close to the same thing. That boy... You can't even say his name. His name is Ian. I know his name. I hear it enough. You don't know anything about him. And have you ever even invited him over for dinner and tried to get to know him? No! Well, I don't need to know him to know that you're... That you're too young to be going steady. "Going steady"? Mmm-hmm. What is this? The '50s? Mom, be honest. You wouldn't like any boy I went out with. That is... (BOYS TALKING INDISTINCTLY) LAURIE: This boy that... This Ian... You really like him? KELLEY: He makes me feel special. LAURIE: You're special to me. KELLEY: No, Zach's special to you. You always wanted me to be special, but I'm not. I... I cannot... Zach, let's go. Here, you drive. Zach, in the back. Come on. Let's go. Face it, Mom. Dance classes, tennis classes, photography, cheerleading, the hospice, all those things that you made me do. Made? You... You wanted to do those things! I was encouraging your interests. No, you wanted me to do those things. And even when I did, you pushed me until I didn't any more. The tennis matches and camp? I just wanted to play once in a while, not compete. (EXASPERATED SIGH) (FEMALE DISPATCHER TALKING OVER RADIO) (GASPS) OFFICER: Roll the window down. The window. Roll it down. Ma'am, I'm afraid you can't sleep here. This is commercial property and I could cite you for trespassing. Really? I'm sorry. If you don't have any money for a hotel room, there's a homeless shelter downtown, the Metropolitan Ministry on Florida Avenue. If they're full, I got a 24-hour number I can give you. No, no, we're not homeless, Officer. Okay. Well, you still have to move on. There's a rest stop about eight miles up the 75. You think you can find it? Uh, up the 75? Okay. Be careful. Lock your doors. You take care of your mom now, okay? Thank you, Officer. Seatbelt. So you would be willing to take some domestic work? Housekeeping... At this point, I would take anything. I just need to work. A paycheck of some sort. Um, you haven't listed an address here? What about a phone number? I don't have one right now. Um, is that a problem? Well, how are we supposed to contact you if something opens up? Well, how about I call you? Say, once a day to check whether you have anything for me? Yeah, we can try that. But don't harass me with a lot of phone calls? Absolutely. No, of course not. Thanks for your application, and we'll give you a call... I'll be waiting for your call. Did you give any more thought about what we talked about, about the college thing? I don't think I'm really the college type. You've seen my grades. Well... I dunno. How about your photography? Stop with the photography thing. That's just, you know, for fun. Okay. I like cooking. I don't know. I love to eat. So, you know... Cooking thing, maybe? Well, maybe you should take some classes over the summer. See if you like it. Yeah? Mmm-hmm. Are they expensive? I don't know. It's gotta be cheaper than college. You know, we could take 'em together. Really? Yeah. (LAUGHING) Seriously? That would be so cool. All right. (DOORBELL RINGS) Huh. Wonder who that is. Hi, Z. Bonner? His mother, but I'm willing to give that up for some quiet. I got a package here for Zach Bonner. Can you sign this, please? Okay. Uh... Thank you very much. All right. Um, excuse me? Where's our package? It's not one. It's 500 of them. 500 what? Bears. 500 Build-A-Bear bears. Yes! Whoo! Yes! Oh, my... Zach, what did you do? Well, I sent 100 e-mails to big companies asking for donations, and one answered. So, where do you want 'em? Uh... In the garage, I guess. Zach? What are we supposed to do with 500 stuffed bears? (OVER PA) On behalf of myself, Kristy Kilgo, and all the employees here at the Lazydays RV center, we would like to welcome the mothers and children of the Tampa Bay Shelter for Women and wish them a very merry Christmas. I got a bear. (ALL TALKING) (BALLOON POPPING) Oh! Oh, that hurt! LAURIE: They're really good. Merry Christmas. MAN: Enjoy. Oh, I will. Thank you. Enjoy. Merry Christmas. SANTA: You've been a good girl, right? You promise? Yes. (LAUGHS) Okay. You have a merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Hi! Merry Christmas! This is for you. Hi... You promise? All right. I promise. (LAUGHS) Merry Christmas. How are you? Good. Good. Enjoy. MAN: Merry Christmas. Um, I'm sorry, Nana. I was told that CNN would pick it up... I was promised CNN. (SING-SONG VOICE) Hello! PUBLICIST: Stand over here. Okay, let's get some kids over here and kick this puppy down the stairs. Thank you. Let's get you some presents. Thank you. You were great. Merry Christmas. (CLEARS THROAT) TV legend Nana Galloway stopped in Tampa recently. Santa, I need to borrow you just a second. ...to promote her charitable foundation and her recently released box set of her TV series, Busybody. She's here to help less fortunate women and children. Let's have a word with her. Miss Galloway... Excuse me, chief. Nana... What drives you to interrupt your busy schedule to do things like this? I'm always looking to help. It's what I do. It's part of who I am. Busybody? Yep. It was a little before your time. It was about this old lady who snoops around her neighborhood, solving everyone's problems. I'm always looking to help. Big smile. It's in my nature, what I'm all about. I'm just hoping that tonight we can give a little joy to these women and children... It was opposite Fantasy Island. The looks on their little faces when they open these presents is the only gift I need this Christmas. Laurie. Hi! Oh! I haven't seen you since the Be More Awards. Kristy, I'm so sorry. I didn't see you standing there. And I'm sorry we didn't come over earlier to say hello. You did such a good job putting this all on for Zach. Oh, well, me and Harold and our foundation. But, really, it's our employees here. They volunteer their time, but they also have a portion of their income deducted from every paycheck to help fund our charitable works. (SOFTLY) Wow. At Lazydays, we like to say, "We pay the kids first." ...one collection. I'm glad I could help. (SIGHS) We really appreciate it. Doesn't it just grind your middle kidney that Galloway's riding on your son's coattails? Well... You know what? You should get in on this photo opportunity. You're responsible for most of this. Miss Galloway? Yes? Um... Miss Galloway, this is Zach Bonner. His foundation helped make this event happen. A lot of it. I think you should get a picture with the Bonner family. No, that's okay. You go. All right, let's bring you right over here. And maybe just with the kid for now. (LAUGHS) A little young to have your own foundation, mister. Maybe you could help us. Some autographed photos, or some DVDs. We like to sell that kind of stuff on eBay to raise money. Sorry, son, but Nana doesn't get involved in anything that raises less than a million dollars. I can raise a million dollars. (SCOFFS) A bit of advice, Jack? Zach. Whatever. Do kid things. Stay a kid as long as you can. You leave this kind of thing to us adults. PUBLICIST: We'll be late for the next appointment. Bye, everyone. Ugh! Did you see me get ganked? Ganked? What kind of word is that? And then that d-bag pushed me out of the picture. Hey! Hush! Don't you be calling people d- bags in the middle... Like I was gonna break their freakin' camera! You be quiet now! Okay, you were mistreated. What do you want me to do? Just say the word. Don't say that word. Say any other word. Hey, hey, hey! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Consider me vented. Lord! (SIGHS) Oh. Mom? Yes, honey. You think Nana Galloway really raised a million dollars? Well, I don't doubt it. I mean, she's famous. You get that much attention from the media, you can do just about anything. Oh, the power of publicity. Mmm. Publicity? Yeah, you know. The TV and the news people, and, like, when papers and magazines write about you. Or, you know, when you were on TV and you got all those donations. It was... It was just ginormous. It was huge! Yeah, I know what publicity is, but how do you get it? Well, you just gotta do something that'll get their attention. You know, like Paris Hilton. Um, excuse me. Yeah, that's good. Like she has... Paris Hilton? Don't be giving him any ideas. I wasn't gonna... Okay. Fine. That's a... (MIMICS ZIPPING) I was just gonna tell him... Fine. Thank you. The tape... Stop it right there. Okay. (MIMICS ZIPPING) All right. There's no smoking, no alcohol, no drugs, no fighting, and no loud noises. (COUGHING) Thank you, Mom. And don't give my staff any grief. There'll be a hot breakfast from 7:30 to 9:00. You have to be out by 9:30. This is your room. Please be considerate, and clean up after yourselves. Have a good night. Thank you. Good night. I get the top bunk. (LAUGHS) It's not bad. It's clean. Yeah. (THUNDER RUMBLING) MAN: Wakey, eggs and bakey! Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey! (JIM CLEARS THROAT) You okay? Yeah. Did you sleep okay? Yeah. You? I slept pretty good. (SIGHS) I smell bacon. (BOTH SIGHING) Morning. Morning. Mmm. Mmm. Should we get some breakfast? (SIGHS) Yeah. Mom, where's my backpack? Did you bring it in from the car? Yeah, it was right here. My bag's gone. How could... They came in while we were sleeping? My purse... My wallet's gone. Somebody... How? It was... I mean, it was right under my pillow! How could... My food stamp card, my driver's license. Oh, God, no. (SOFTLY) My Gamebite. Your Gamebite? Your Gamebite. Do you realize what we just lost? Do you? (MEEKLY) So what do we do now? I don't know. If I knew, I would tell you! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. NARRATOR ON TV: From 1953 to 1981, a silver haired woman calling herself only Peace Pilgrim, walked more than 25,000 miles on a personal pilgrimage for peace. She vowed to remain a wanderer until mankind has learned the way of peace. Walking until given shelter, and fasting until given food. (MAN CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV) Ian and I broke up. (SIGHS) ZACH: Hey, guys, look at this. We could do this. Do what? Walk across America to raise awareness. About homeless kids. (SCOFFS) Across America? Zach, I don't think so. (SIGHS) Well, to Washington D.C. then. It'd be great publicity. It would get people to care more about homeless kids. Good idea, Zach, but... Do you know how far that is? I mean, that'd take months. Well, to somewhere closer. Maybe to the state capital, Atlanta. (SCOFFS) The state capital is Tallahassee. No, I meant capital to capital. Tallahassee to Atlanta. Anyone can walk to Tallahassee. Oh, you think so? Hmm. Maybe when you're older. How old? Older. (MAN CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV) Oh, um... Can I get a job? Just, you know... But, Mom, I need to do something big. Kelley, you said that's what gets publicity, and publicity is what gets donations. Look, don't get me involved in any more of your cranial rectal ideas. Whoa! Mom, you wanna do something together. We could all do this together. Honey, what did I say? Maybe when you're older. LAURIE: I don't know, Mama. He does it 'cause he likes it. (DOORBELL RINGS) Uh... Yeah, and things. Hundreds of Build-A-Bears, these things called Gertie Balls. (LAUGHS) Why what? Why does he do it or why do they give him money? Oh, hang on, Mama. Ms. Bonner. Yes? Ashley Legare, remember? Channel 5 News. I received an e-mail from Zach and we'd like to interview him about his walk to Tallahassee. My Zach? Yes. Mama, I'm gonna have to call you back. All right. Zach Bonner! Did you check the map? Do you know how far it is to Tallahassee? Not really, no. (ASHLEY LAUGHS) Well, who is going with you? My mom and my sister. Okay. So why is it you really wanna do this? Well, because, you know, it's helping homeless kids, and it's fun. For Channel 5, this is Ashley Legare. And cut. That was great. All right. Nice work, little man. Thanks. I'll get your mic, here. You must be so proud. Yeah, I'm about to bust. You know, I was wondering... Excuse me. All right, stay on the state roads for sure. That way you don't have to deal with all the red tape and stuff you need on federal highways... And try to go through the media market towns, you know? Oh, man! I know some of the TV stations along the way. We can give 'em a heads up, you know? Oh... You know what we can do? Hook you up with a GPS tracker. You know, so people can follow you on the Internet. Really? That'd be so cool! The "Zach Tracker". Hey, Mom, did you hear that? Oh, yeah, I heard it. LAURIE: I cannot believe that you went behind my back after I told you no. There's no way we can do this. But I already announced it. Well, that is your problem, young man. You are just gonna have to call them up and tell them that you changed your mind. What? But I wanna do it! Do you know how far it is? Have you even thought about this? I mean, who would take care of the house? And have you thought about money? We don't have the money for all this. And then what about my business? I mean, I can't just be traipsing halfway across Florida. Mom, it's just walking. It doesn't cost a thing just to walk. Are you serious? What about hotel rooms? What about food? Well, I can raise money for food. Get donations from restaurants, I bet. And I called Kristy from Lazydays to see if we can borrow an RV so we wouldn't have to go to hotels. Their charity might give us some money for gas. Are you telling me that you called after I told you no? No! I was just doing research. I asked her "if". They said that they "might" help. "Might", Zach. That is a long way from "yes". Okay. But, Mom, if I get the RV and raise enough money and figure out the house thing, can I do it? Do you know how long it would take to walk that far? Most of the summer, probably. And your sister and I have plans. Kelley, you can help, too. It'd be fun. You could do the publicity stuff. You're really good at that. Look, you can go on ahead, but you're doing this one without me. No, Kel, it's for all of us to do. It would be fun. It could be like our family project for the summer. Whenever we do something together, we have so much fun. Remember making the Christmas ornaments for the old folks' home? Christmas caroling? That was fun. And it'll be like that. But better. (SIGHS) Oh, come on, Kel. Say yes. Say yes. (SIGHS) I'll do anything you want me to do after this. (MOUTHING) Okay. Maybe. Maybe. That's it. Thanks, Kel. Mom? Mmm... Just hold on, mister. You still have some big hoops to jump through before this is a done deal. No sweat. I'm gonna go e - mail Kristy. So much for those cooking classes, huh? (SOFTLY) Don't worry about it. This is such a long shot, Kel. WOMAN OVER PA: Any further business? Okay, before we go, Kristy and Harold have someone who would like to speak to us. Zach Bonner. You can do it. WOMAN: Zach? (ALL APPLAUDING) Uh... "Thank you for this opportunity to speak to you. "There are estimated 1.3 million homeless children in the United States. "2% of the children in this country, "10% of all poor children. "The major causes of child homelessness "are family problems, economic or money-related problems. (MAN CLEARS THROAT) "Homelessness makes these children vulnerable to violence or abuse." (MOUTHING) (SIGHS) Okay, you know what? You all got a Be More Awd for helping homeless children get off the streets. You all know that. So, I guess when you find out what these kids are going through, it's hard not to do something. But it's a really big problem. Over one million kids. I can't even put that in my head. That's like... Raymond James Stadium 15 times overfilled with kids without homes. So, you ask yourself, "How can only one person help?" So, you got together and created your own foundation to help these kids. That's so cool! (ALL CHUCKLING) And now you're probably looking at me and thinking, "How can this one little kid help?" But the way I see it, it's like cleaning your room. Whenever it's really messy and too big of a problem, you ignore it. you shove it under the bed, whatever. But if you pick one small spot, work on it, then another, eventually it gets done. My mom taught me that. (ALL LAUGHING) That's how I think we should go about with helping these kids. So my small part is to walk to our state capital in Tallahassee. Along the way, I hope to speak to schools and media outlets to raise awareness about the homeless kids. So, I'll pick up the dirty clothes, and you guys put away the toys or make the bed. (ALL LAUGHING) One day, our room will be clean. And one day, there won't be any more homeless kids to help. Thank you. (ALL APPLAUDING) I move that we see if we can get that RV for him and donate $1,000 from the fund to Zach's walk. (APPLAUDING) Do we have a second to that motion? ALL: Seconded! You know what? $1,000 isn't gonna do it. Here you go, Zach. Anyone else? (ALL MURMURING) MAN: Good luck, kid. ZACH: Thanks. (SIGHS) Thank you. Thank you. Come on. Did you think... Yeah, he... He wouldn't be able to do it, huh? Well, I mean, did you think that he'd be able to do it? But look at him. Thank you. LAURIE: It's unbelievable. Thank you. Thank you. Kel... Look, I'm so sorry. I know that you're disappointed. But we can always do those cooking classes next summer, all right? Come on. Sure. Hmm, it's not a done deal yet. I still have to figure out how we survive. But you can do it, right? I'll give it my best. That's all I can tell you. (SIGHS) Teeth. (DOOR OPENING) Where do you think you're going? Anywhere but here. Um, no, you're not. You're 16. 17 in a month. I call the cops, they'll drag you right back here. You wouldn't. You wanna try me? Look, Kelley, I know you're upset. Upset? Upset? You promised! It was a plan. Plans change. Life does that to us all the time. I had plans. All sorts of plans. I made the best out of what was dealt me. Really? Yes. Does your life suck? Because mine sucks! LAURIE: Are you kidding me? Mom. Zach... I want you to go to bed right now. But... Right now, I don't care. Go ahead. Go in there right now. Right now. So your life sucks, huh? (DOOR CLOSES) Do you want for anything? No. I provide for your every need, for your every little whim. Girl, poke your head out of that sheltered life of yours and take a look at mine for a second. I am the sole provider for this family. Every day I have to find a way to keep our heads above water. Every day, whether we eat or not, it is all on me and some days, that is plain bone crushing. But I do it. Is that why you're trying to ruin my life? Because yours is so pathetic? My life is in no way pathetic, Kelley, and I'm so sorry it seems that way to you. Yes, maybe before this I was just treading water, before Zach started on his... His mission here. But this has given him a purpose, a dream. For me, too. And maybe just once, instead of only thinking about yourself, maybe just once you could think about climbing aboard. You know what? (SHOUTING) I don't give a damn about his dream! My life is a nightmare! You better watch it, young lady. (SCREAMING) I will not! You will watch it in my house! You wanna grow up so fast? Well, every once in a while, us grown-ups, more than we'd like, have to suck it up and move on. So get your butt back in your room. Clean that up. You clean it up! (DOOR SLAMMING) Listen to me. You don't get the life you want, you know. You get what comes down the line. You live with that or you be miserable. It is your choice. (THUDDING) (LAURIE SOBBING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) ZACH: Kelley? You mad at me? What do you think? You wouldn't really go, would you? I didn't pack for a vacation. But I don't want you to go. Ever. I'm gonna go someday. So will you. We're in this together. We're a team. The Dynamic Trio. Us against the world. You remember that? You were so little. I still am little. Don't give me that "puppy dog Zach" act. You can play everyone else, including Mom, but you can't play your sister. (WHISPERS) Sorry. But this would be fun, Kel. I was thinking you'd be like the publicity whatchamacallit. You know, calling the newspaper and the radio people, and the TV stations during the walk. I bet you'll like it much more than the cooking. You never quit, do you? What do you mean? Go all innocent on me. You're such a selfish little jerk sometimes. I wish I cared about something as much as you do. But I don't. So I just... People walk all over me like a doormat. But you're not a doormat. (LAUGHS HUMORLESSLY) Yeah, I am. (SIGHS) Hey. Mom said to come eat breakfast. She make biscuits? Yep. (SIGHS) She thinks she can buy me with biscuits. Well, that works for me. Hey... Look, I was thinking... I guess I could be your publicity whatchamacallit, okay? Really? Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (LAUGHS) This will be fun, Kel. You watch. Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess what? Hey. (DOOR CLOSES) Did you get a new driver's license? There's a $10 fee. Hey, I was in the line and I was thinking, "What else could we get with $10?" A couple of meals, enough gas to get us somewhere else. And then I was thinking... Somewhere else? Where? Do you remember Daddy talked about that aunt he had up in Waukeenah? Um, yeah. Well, I haven't communicated with her for ages, but she was so nice. She really liked me. I don't know. What do you think? We could go up there and... Let's do it. Really? Yeah. You'll like her. Really? Yeah, she's funny. (EXHALES) Come on. May I help you? I'm looking for Cynthia McHugh. Uh, I'm sorry. I tried calling earlier, but she must have changed the number or something. Is she at home? Um, I don't know a Cynthia McHugh. Well, she... She used to live here. I just moved but six months ago myself. I'm sorry. Did she, um... Did she leave a forwarding address? No. Thank you. SENATOR OVER PA: You know, he may have coined the term Little Red Wagon from his vibrant red hair, as well as his vibrant red wagon. (ALL CHUCKLING) But, uh, he is probably the youngest founder, president of any non-profit organization that you'll ever meet. Quite a remarkable young man, and of course, I am speaking of Zach Bonner with the Little Red Wagon Foundation. (ALL CHEERING) Zach is being tracked. (LAUGHS) SENATOR: I say young man... Look at this, Zach. All these people. (LAUGHS) All this commotion. Look what you started with your little red wagon. (SENATOR CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) You've done something remarkable. Just give yourself a minute and take it all in. SENATOR: Not only does he do these good works, but he also inspires others to help him and to do these good works themselves. Very admirable. Kel, I think you should get to the first rendezvous point. Can't I wait until the ribbon cutting? Oh, of course. Of course. Then you should get going. Hey, I'm driving, you're walking. Who's gonna get there first? Duh. Okay, okay. (SHUSHING) Kelley, listen to me. This is gonna be hard on all of us, okay? But it has become bigger than just you and me. So let's just try our best, and get along. I will make an effort if you will. Yes, I'm sorry, all right? Okay. Okay. The state of Florida is walking with him, and I am walking with him every step of the way. CROWD: Yeah! (HORN BLOWS) (ALL CHEERING) ALL: (CHANTING) Bonner! Bonner! Bonner! MAN: Yeah! Look at that, it's really pretty. Yeah. I'd like to be in a boat out there. All these items look like they belong to old folks. (LAUGHS) They look like they belong to old folks? They probably do belong to old folks. At some point they were... Young people... (PANTING)...somebody's... KELLEY: How you guys doing? Oh, we're doing all right, aren't we, Zach? But you know what? We need to refresh the bug juice. Those flies are mean out there. And, uh... You know what? You need to put more sunblock on and then hydrate. Yeah, I've been keeping the water cold on ice. Thank you. KELLEY: Zach, how you doing? On the way here, we saw a crow with a lizard in its claws. No way. LAURIE: We did. Or it could've been a baby alligator. That's so cool. LAURIE: You think? Oh! Oh, um... Do you want us to move the next stop closer or keep it where we planned? No, I think we're okay. Right, Zach? I'm good. KELLEY: Yeah? LAURIE: (SIGHS) We're good. Oh, you know what? Did you get the Tampa papers? Yeah, they're right here. Oh, good. Can you believe it? That they spelled my name wrong? Oh, terrible! That's awful. Hey! It's not a big deal, honey. It is a big deal! Oh, come on. No, it is a big deal. It's my name! Kelley. K-E-L-L-E-Y. E- Y! It's not a big deal. And they're like, "L-Y". It's... (GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION) Oh, come on. Do you want me... How hard is that? Do you want me to call the editor? I will. I will call him tomorrow and I will say... What are they gonna do? "Listen, Mr. Man, you put her name K- E-L-L-E-Y "in big bold print letters and big picture and it'll be really pretty." I see what you're doing. Sorry. (KELLEY GROANS) Vented. I'm okay. All right. Let's hydrate and keep on. Zach, do you need to pee? KELLEY: Take your water. Zach? I guess he doesn't need to pee. I do, but I guess that doesn't matter. I'll see you at the next one. I'll see you at the next... Bye. Bye. Oh, sweet! A dollar. (FLIES BUZZING) JIM: Ugh! Gross! What's that smell? Ugh! I think it's a dead cat! Just go into the next one. Jackpot, Mom! Be careful. Look what I got! Oh! (SCREAMS) (GROANING) (GASPS) Oh! (WHIMPERING) Are you okay? (GROANS) (COUGHS) Okay, it's okay, it's gonna be okay. Let me check. (SCREAMING) (SOBS) Oh, I'm sorry. Just let me take a look. Just let me take a little look. Okay, come on. We're gonna go, okay? We're gonna go. (WHIMPERS) LAURIE: What's a profit? ZACH: I have no idea. Probably, like, a spice. LAURIE: With all that money... Hey, guys. LAURIE: (TIREDLY) Oh, hi. (GROANS) Oh, I swear, every bone in my body hurts. Well, dinner on the table for you and here's some epsom salts for your feet. What? Kelley, I think you're an angel. I do. I got some coming up for you, too, Zach. I take back every bad thing I ever said about you. Aw, thanks. Well, we did it. One day down. Quite a few more to go. But we don't look at it like that, we take it one day at a time, one mile at a time, one foot in front of the other. Right, Zach? KELLEY: Oh! Zach? (BOTH LAUGHING) It's chicken in his hand. Oh, that's not cool. Okay. Here you go. Cover him with this. (BABY WAILING) (WOMAN SHUSHING) (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Excuse me. Excuse me. (LOUDLY) Excuse me. We have been waiting six and a half hours. When are we gonna see a doctor? Ma'am, we take the priority cases first. Priority? My son could have a concussion. His arm could be broken. Priority here means life or death. There are patients here who have waited longer than you. But he's a kid. He's a kid. I'm sorry. (BIRDS TWITTERING) (HONKING) Thank you, thank you, thank you. Wait, wait. Let me get some ice. (MOANS) There's more. Oh! (LAUGHING) Is it good? LAURIE: I would not. No, thank you. (ALL CHUCKLING) KELLEY: Yes, Mr. Senator. Well, I do believe you should be there around 2:00 or 3:00 p.m., I would say. (BEEPS) You all right? (GAGS) (RETCHES) Oh! Oh, honey, honey. Zach? Oh, Zach! Oh, honey. Oh! Oh, babe. All right. Okay. (GROANING) Wait. Let's go find Kel. She's over here. Come on. Hey, Zach? I think we should call it a day. Okay? You've done so many miles... No! We can't cheat. The homeless don't get a day off. (CHUCKLES) All right. I'll meet you at the next rest stop. Okay. All right, buddy? Take it slow, okay? (INAUDIBLE) (LAUGHING) (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (LAUGHING) I beat you. All right. (CHUCKLES) WOMAN: Mrs. Bonner! Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Um, the girls... We were wondering if we could walk with Zach? You know, they want to do their part. Uh, sure, I guess. How... How did you find out about us? Um, well, we've actually... We've been using the Zach Tracker and we've been following you guys since Tampa. Oh, really? The Zach Tracker, isn't that nice? So, what do you say, Zach? Sure, I guess. (ALL CHEERING) All right. Let's go. Ha! Very interesting. Nice work, chick magnet. (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Quite a show. Sure? Like how you want it. Look, where are we going? We need to get you something to eat. But we don't have any money. I know that! Oh, I'm sorry. We're gonna steal some food? I'm gonna do what I have to do. Come on, come on. Here we go. What do you want? Uh... Tuna, ham and cheese, veggie roll? Um, the tuna? Come on, come on. Aren't you gonna get one for you? Does that look weird? No. Come on. (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) What's wrong, Momma? We're not these kind of people. We're not. Stay there. (SIGHS) Oh, Lord. What am I supposed to do? Here, honey. Come on. ZACH: We're the homeless, those who have nothing. A small thing that we take for granted, a book, clean underwear, or a simple toy can give them just a little happiness. Maybe for only a moment. Sometimes the smallest act of kindness can change a person's life. Or it could be the one thing that gives them enough hope to go on, or to start again. Okay. Thursday... SHELTER WOMAN: You have to make your own bed, and in case you get cold you're gonna have a couple of those. Thank you. And I have something for you. We have a couple of these left. What's this? They call 'em Zach Packs. Some kid puts them together and that one's yours to keep. Thanks. You're welcome. Okay. Why don't you follow me this way and I'll show you to your room. All right? Go ahead and get settled in. Take your time, but dinner's in about an hour. Okay? So why don't you come down to the dining hall. All right? Thank you. Okay, thanks. Here you go. Thanks. Mom, look, there's food. Chef Boyardee. (CLEARS THROAT) Um... Candy, deodorant, soap... Oh, can I see? Yeah. Some cool comic. "Kid Fuel." (CHUCKLES) Oh, man! Socks. Mom, look, a yo-yo! Remember that yo-yo Dad gave me? That lit up. Oh, I loved that. I may need to borrow some of this toothpaste. Is that okay? Sure. Look, Spider-Man. Wow! And I can do a lap around the world. Good job! Thanks. Oh, man. This is tough. There. There. (CHUCKLES) Hold on. I can do it. (SIGHS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) So... What do you wanna talk about? I'm talked out. No, we got Greek myths. Um... Stupid human tricks? Mom, I'm talked out. You okay? Yeah, I'm just talked out. Okay. Well... I was hoping you could amuse me some, but... Mom, please. Oh. All right, all right. If you're too worn out, then... (EXHALES) (WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (TYPING) MARGARET: Hey. (CHUCKLES) You ready? Yeah. Do you wanna get something to eat? Are you... You hungry? Mmm, okay. Okay. What you so happy about? (WHISPERS) I got a job. A job? Yes! Really? No way! I did. Yes! (SHUSHING) (MUFFLED LAUGH) Come on. Here. People at the Hope Center got me an interview, just temp work, but it could be a permanent thing. Depends on how I perform. Thank you. Sorry. You'll be great. Really? Yeah. First thing we gotta do is get you back into school. Okay. Get you registered. But where're we gonna live? I'm working on that, too. (BOTH CHUCKLE) You know what? I think we're gonna be okay. I mean, I really do. Yeah. I know it's been hard on you, but... I think your dad would be so proud, how you got through all this. Do you know what I miss most? When Dad would come back from a trip and he would give me a high-five for getting an A in social studies or something. Up top for some props. I miss those. You know? Yeah. Well, I can give you a high-five! No, Mom. You got a job, you get a high-five. (CHUCKLES) Down low, for both of us. KELLEY: Keep going, keep going. Come on, back, Mom! Come on, come on. Oh, stop, stop, stop! Oh! I can't believe it. She wasn't paying attention again. Oh! Look what you did. You smashed up the RV. What, I did? You were driving. Oh, my. You were supposed to be looking out for me. Who cares? We have insurance. Lazydays has insurance. It's their RV. They trusted me with this very expensive beast and now we've busted it! Mom! Kelley! You know what, the problem is you don't care about other people's things. You only care about yourself. Me, me, me. And all you care about is Zach! You and everybody else. Oh, you are going down this road again. Nobody takes my photo. You know, they can't even spell my name right. I do all the scut work. I wake up at the ass-crack of dawn and work my tail off... Watch your language... all day! And all I get is yelled at! Well, you know what? Not anymore. I'm out of here! Go ahead and quit. Just like you quit everything else you ever did! Everything you made me do! Of course, I made you do it. Mom, make her come back. All right, Kelley, get... Just get back here, we need to finish this. You know what? You get yourself a maid. ZACH: I'm gonna go get her. Zach! No. No. No, no, no. I'll deal with her. Can you just manage by yourself for a minute, please? Okay? Go inside, lock the door behind you, okay? I'll be right back. With Kelley. Lock it. It's dangerous for a young girl to be out on the road. At night, alone. But you know that. I know a lot of things. Not that you've ever given me credit for... But you don't know everything. And neither do you. Well, I know... And I'll be the first to admit it. Look, I apologize. I'm just tired, we're all tired. Come back. No. Hey! Where're you gonna go? Ian's been calling me, trying to get back. I know you don't like him. (SIGHS) Like I said, I don't know everything but I do know this... The wrong man can ruin everything. (SOBBING) Not every man, just some. Are you really gonna start with this again? Kelley. I understand what you're going through. I was young and in love once. I loved and then I lost. And I loved again, and lost again. And somewhere between the hurt and the hollow... Well, I just figured I wasn't much good at that. So, I gave it up. I put everything I have, my heart and my soul into my children. Family is everything to me. You know that. I'm asking you to come back. Please. I can't do that. Why? You treat Zach better than me. Admit it. Yes, I do. See! But do you know why? Because you love him more than me, you always have. That's where you're wrong, Kel. I treat him better because I learned how. And I learned it messing up with you. I admit it. I messed up. It was on the job training and I didn't know what I was doing half the time. I still mess up with Zach. Sometimes I feel like I'm just barely hanging on... I don't know what you want from me. I'm sorry. I know that's not enough. It breaks my heart to see you in pain, and knowing that I am the cause of it makes it even worse. Please, hear me. I'm sorry. (SOBBING) It's... It's too late. It is? Um... Well... Then I guess you better take the van. I don't want you hitching. But what about you and Zach? Um, we have the RV. And tomorrow? Um, we'll manage. Mom. Did you ever think about doing something just for yourself? Cut me and Zach a little bit of slack? (SNIFFLES) But I'm very happy with you kids. All I've ever wanted was a family. You be safe. (SOFTLY) Zach, come here. Come here, darling. I never told you this. But when you were just a baby and... I was first a mom with you kids... We, uh... We were in bad shape. I was in bad shape. We didn't wind up homeless, but, um... We came real, real close. I was as frightened as I've ever been in my life. I was scared to death. And I look at those moms and their kids, and I know that could have been us. What you're doing here, it touches me, Zach. In ways I can't even explain. I am so proud of you. And I'm so glad I get to help you with this. So, let's you and me finish this, okay? Let's go help those kids and then we'll go home, we'll fix our own problems. All right? Come on, buck up. Tomorrow's the big day. Think about all you've accomplished here. You did it, Zach. You did it. (BELL RINGING) (SIREN WAILING) Mom. I see her. (SOBBING) I'm glad you came back. Took our first step together. We're gonna take our last step together. # Close your eyes # Remember when # Your first little wagon came # Shiny new and red # And your daddy pulled you around and around # You felt so loved You felt so proud # Now open up your eyes and you will see # Children waiting for the love they need # So reach out your hand # And change the world # Make this promise to every boy and every girl # Reach out your hands # We will change the word # One little red wagon # At a time # Each one loved Not left alone # Fills their eyes with light and hope # And all these children they belong to you and I # They're yellow and brown # They're red and black and white # So reach out your hand and change the world # Make this promise to every boy and every girl # Reach out your hands we will change the world # One little red wagon # One little red wagon # One little red wagon # At a time
