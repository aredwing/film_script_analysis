The laughing falcon, known for its loud and distinctive call. He ain't laughing now. Well, that's because a Belizean botfly laid an egg in its ear. And when the larvae hatched, he ate its way out through its brain. They say the botfly is attracted to excessive ear wax, so better watch them ears, Luis. So what's going on? What you got there? Something I think you all will want to see. Where did you get this? It washed up along the Mopan River just a few miles from here. "Transgen Tech. " What does that mean? This belonged to my father. Your father? You never told me he worked down here. He didn't tell me, either. He disappeared before he had the chance. That area is off limits to scientists, tourists, and especially gringos. My father vanished three months ago, Luis, and now we finally have a clue to what might have happened. And now you just want me to ignore it. I only met your father once, the day he arrived. You are just like him. Thank you, Luis. Buena suerte, seorita. I hate to see you go missing, too. Come on. Camera's ruined from the water damage. SD card still works. What the hell are we looking at? I don't know. I've never seen anything like it, especially not that size. Looks like an abandoned field lab. So what do we actually know about Transgen Tech? Not much. Before today, it was nothing, only one long wild goose chase, leading to one dead end after another. Gina, what the hell is going on? Your father just disappeared and you didn't even tell me? My father really loved field work. He said he only felt alive when he was knee-deep in an anthill or romping around in the rain forest. When I was little, he would disappear for months at a time. Sometimes he'd just fall off the grid for weeks. All I would get would be these little mementos for my birthday. Then one night out of the blue, I get a call, which is already weird, because he never calls me. And there's something wrong. I can hear it in his voice. He's in trouble. And what did he say? He said that he loved me, that he was really sorry, that he'd make it all up to me. And then I didn't hear from him. The authorities traced the call to some fleabag motel in Belmopan, but all they found was his I.D. Badge. Transgen Tech. Yeah. After that, the trail went cold. And how come you never came down here to look? Oh, that's why we're here, isn't it? That's what you and Luis have been up to this whole time. And that's why you disappeared for hours and hours every night. Why wouldn't you tell me? Who do you think you are anyway, Lara Croft? I didn't think you would come if you knew the real reason. And we sure as hell wouldn't have gotten that grant. You really should have told me. I know. I'm sorry. Belizean botfly? I should have known something was up. So what did the authorities say? They said, "Just another gringo lost in the jungle. " So tell me more about your father. What, are you all on the case now or something? Well, I can't exactly let you go wandering the rain forest alone, now, can I? I mean, even Lara Croft needs a sidekick. You know that sidekicks never make it into the sequel, right? That's fine. I'm willing to take my chances. All right, so Dad was really into biogenetic engineering. Mosquitoes to combat the dengue fever and the kissing bugs to slow down the spread of Chagas. Well, whatever that was, it was no kissing bug. Yeah. I have a feeling that if we want to find him, we're gonna have to find out what that was. We don't have a whole lot here to go off of, though. Most digital cameras have geo-locational tagging. Cross your fingers. Jackpot. Cayo District. No, you heard Luis. That's way out of bounds. We can't go there. If there's any chance my father is alive, any chance at all, I'm gonna have to go. I really don't like you sometimes. I know. We leave first thing in the morning. What's that? Monkey. All right, there, there, there. Oh, yeah. Little early, isn't it? Ha. It's been one of those days. What's the forecast? Forecast is hot and heavy. Mountain rebels are up and active up in these points here, here, and in the northeast. All right, cut the crap, Meyers. You can't even look me in the eyes. What's the real intel? Transfer's up. Unbelievable. Guess I'm sharing this with you. That the good stuff? Only the best. Yeah, most of the guys in country here, they'd give their arm and a leg to go back, but... I want to stay. I love the jungle. Every dog has its day, John. Today's yours. What's going on? What's happening? Look ahead. Any way around it? Not unless you want to hike for the next three days. Let's go for it. Let me do the talking, okay? You'll just end up getting us deported or worse. He's coming. Excuse me, ladies. I'm gonna need you guys to turn this jeep around and head back the way you came, please. Oh, actually, we're just forestry students from the university. Our group's already camped up in the mountains. This is a restricted area. I'm gonna need you to turn around and head back. I understand, but we just need to get there before nighttime. We're American citizens. Look, let me show you. Listen, I'm not gonna warn you two again. Turn this... All right, all right, look, Mister Officer, we're not gonna turn around. So either you let us through, arrest us, whatever. We're not going back. Did you really think that was going to work? Yes. I mean, we're not deported. Or worse, remember? This is the "or worse. " Guess I shouldn't complain. At least you managed to get us arrested before getting us killed. Day's still early. All right, there's no point in lying to us anymore. We know exactly who you both are. What we don't know is what you're trying to do here. Okay, we're not forestry students. We're scientists, but the real reason we're here is because my father's missing. His last known location was near these mountains. We just want to pass through. After that, you'll never see us again. Not gonna happen. You have any idea why we're stationed here? I'm guessing it's not a goodwill mission. Is it jungle training? Too much reality TV for you kids, huh? This country can't even look after its own goddamn borders, so U.S. South Com sets us here to police against terrorists, rebellions, and drug runners. Why'd you list drug runners last? Because they're the worst. Our secondary mandate is to protect civilians and to keep crazy scientists like you two from getting yourselves killed. Got it? Isn't your mandate also to protect American citizens who have been lost or kidnapped under your watch? No one's been lost or kidnapped under my watch. Dr. Herbert Humphries has. That would be my father. Three months ago. Ha. Hate to break it to you, but three months is like three years in this jungle. Well, I have some captivating evidence for you. This was recovered from the SD card in his camera. Taken three days ago. That means he's still out there somewhere alive. Hmm. What do you think, Meyers? You feel like one last hoorah before I'm stateside? Got nothing left to lose. All right, let's go find your daddy. Yes! So what is it that's so bad out here anyways? You don't want to know. Out here in the jungle, there's stuff you ain't gonna find in the bottom of a Petrie dish. Out here, you're bottom of the food chain. Hit the deck! Cover! Cover! Cover! Cover! Go! Go! Yates! Cover! Go! Go! Stay with the girls! Get down! Hello, Foxtrot Six Two! This is Charlie Two One Alpha, over! Incoming enemy fire, over! Paulo! Stop firing! Hold your fire! Beastman, is that you? Ah, Jaguar, I should have known. Yes, that's definitely you. Why don't you and your men just drop your weapons and get the hell out of here. We're just passing through, no trouble. No blood need be shed here today, Beastman. We only want your vehicles, your weapons, and your women. No chance in hell, voodoo man! Don't say you haven't been warned, Beastman. We're gonna take them the hard way! Aah! Cover me! I'm gonna flank them! Copy that! Flank! Flank! Grenade! Aah! Incoming! Next time, Beastman! Anybody hurt? Everything's clear! All right. Come on. So now what? We get the hell out of here. Mission's over. What? I'm not risking my men's lives for this. I'm really sorry about your men, but there is something really wrong here. Listen. I don't hear a thing. Exactly. The only time the jungle goes this quiet is if there's a really large predator around. Hey, boss, you call in air support? Nope. Incoming! Take cover! Rhonda! Get down, get down! Aah! Ortega! Aah! Norving! Shoot that thing! Shoot it down! How's Ortega? Not good. He's not gonna make it back to base. All right, we're gonna have to go someplace closer then. Hey, Simpson, Jennings, get over here! Help get Ortega on the back of the truck, all right? We're going to Jaguar's village. It's closer. Isn't that guy who just tried to kill us? You let me worry about that. What is that? I don't know. There's something you're not telling me. I could say the same thing for you. All right, well, say whatever you want. We're out of here. We can't leave. Watch me! What about the bug? Yeah, we're taking this with us. You can do whatever the hell you want with that. Just make it fast. When you said there are worse things in these mountains, things that no armor could protect you from, were you talking about the Garinagu? No. I was just talking about Jaguar, their leader. The guy thinks he's got some magical powers that make him bulletproof. It's bullshit! What about those things? You ever see anything like that before? Look, only 10% of this jungle's been explored. Who knows what's out there? Only a matter of time before we ran into something more dangerous than Jaguar. All right, grab your gear. Someone help Yates with Ortega. We're on foot from here. Let's move. What about the bug? You can bring that nasty thing if you want to. I'm not carrying it. Look, many insects are repelled by the smell of their dead. This bug could be our best defense. These are our best defense. It's not much further. Step it up! Come on! Whew. Don't these things ever shut up? Well, just be glad you're hearing them and not seeing them. Oh, no way. You've gotta be kidding me. Worst-case scenario, we all go for a swim. I know, I know. I'll make it up to you when we get back. I have bug juice in places that you don't even want to know. There is no making this up to me. Guess I'm off the hook then. Come on. I've been expecting you, Beastman. Welcome back. Have you finally come to face your demon? Look, one of my men is dying. Many of my own men are dead, four at your hands alone. What makes you think I wouldn't just skin you alive and feed you to the spirits of the jungle? Because both of us know there's something else out there besides us... something else that hunts men, a real beast that even you're afraid of. So if we work together, both of our people can survive. That's why I think I'm better off to you alive than skinned alive. For now, but there's a still a debt of blood which must be paid. You owe me four souls. Well, when this is all said and done, you can do whatever you want to me. But save my guy and leave the rest of them out of it, okay? The spirits admire such courage... and so do I. This way. Let's move. There. Careful. Easy. Go on. Your women must leave. Hey, Meyers, check that GPS. See if you can track down our men. What's that? Bones and cocaine for the pain. Hey, Meyers, we're gonna leave that one out of the report, okay? In fact, leave it all out. Eat. Oh, no. Come on, Ortega. Hey! Hey! Eat it, come on. That's an order! Swallow! Ortega? Ortega! Is he gonna be all right? The spirits of the jungle will decide his fate. Yeah, thanks. Oh, don't thank me yet. I don't work for free, and we have much to discuss. El Bicho Diablo. The Devil Bug. For generations, our people have lived in peace and harmony with the animal spirits of the jungle. That peace have been disrupted by El Bicho Diabl. It does not belong here. The spirits cannot rest. So you've seen these before? No. Legend foretold their coming as a great plague to wash away evil. We felt their presence these past few months, growing every day. But they do not attack. This village is protected by the jungle. Your people brought this plague upon the land. What do you mean, "your people"? We had nothing to do with this. That may not be entirely accurate. Are you telling me that you knew what we were dealing with the entire time? That's not entirely true. Stop lying to me and start talking now! All right. My father was an entomologist like me... insects. Only his specialty was genetic engineering. Oh, you didn't think that this was relevant information? He was working for some company called Transgen Tech. He never told me what he was working on, and I couldn't even find any evidence that the company really existed. Then this turned up in a backpack with photos from three days ago. As far as what those things are out there, you know as much as I do. Yeah, well, that's not enough. You need to find out everything you can about these bugs, everything if we're gonna go after them. So get to work. Did you just say "go after them"? What happened to abandon the mission? Well, that was before they took four of my men! And I'm getting them back! Hammond, the chances of those men still being alive... Are a hell of a lot better than the chances of your father being alive, but we went looking for him, didn't we? Okay, you're right. I'll get to work. And no more secrets. Sure you're not gonna miss this kind of thing? Yeah, right. Where the hell is everybody? That voodoo man took them over to those sleep shacks. Says we got to stay the whole night. It's too dangerous. It's for our own good. Well, that's bullshit. Says they got something planned for us later. You do realize these guys are cannibals, don't you? I don't have anything to worry about. I'm too bony. But you, on the other hand, you're like a four-course meal and dessert. Not on my watch. You find our guys yet? Eh, I got four signals. Faint. It's about 12 clicks this way through dense jungle, no roads. Well, we'll never make it there and back by nightfall. Damn it. Guess we're gonna have to take our chances here tonight. What about the men? They'll be all right. I think it's a baboon or a tree sloth. Nah, you're all wrong. It's a jaguar. He eats them raw because he think it gives him powers, so once he offers you what's in that bowl, I suggest you say no. The heart and major organs must be eaten to absorb the animal spirit. Hey, I like a good steak as much as the next guy, but... It's not enough to simply devour the flesh. You must believe. After everything you've seen, you believe, don't you? Ha. Sooner or later, you will. So, what, you're not worried about Los Bichos Diablos attacking? The offering wards off evil. We fear nothing. Right. Gonna pass. Hey, keep your guns close, stay alert. I'm gonna go check on Laverne and Shirley. See how the dissection's going. Ohh... Well, they got dinner, if you can call it that. Doesn't eat me, I'll eat it any time. Well, it's definitely rare like you like it. They were eating raw intestines or something, weren't they? You've been to one of these shindigs, huh? Nat Geo. Season four. Ah. That's one ugly son of a bitch. No, I'm pretty sure this one's just a bitch. Wow, what's that there? Isn't that its, uh, stinger? Actually, that's a modified ovipositor, technically. You lost me. It's basically just a big friggin' wasp. That down there at the very end, that's its stinger. Only the females have stingers. It's quite common in the insect world, women being the warriors. So it's a bee. No, it's not a bee, it's a wasp. Its massive jaws are similar to the Komodo dragon wasp, but it's a bit of a chimera. There's almost a dozen other characteristics similar to hexapods. Six-legged critters. Huh. So where the hell did they come from? Obviously, it's a mutation. Look at its head. That's a Meganeura monyi. A prehistoric dragonfly. That doesn't sound so bad. They were three feet long. And carnivorous. I could have told you that. Here's where it gets really interesting. This thing has similarities to the bombardier beetle, an indestructible exoskeleton. Yeah, I could have told you that, too. See how hard it was to bring this one down? You know what else? These little bumpy lines along the abdomen here, they release these noxious chemical sprays that react when it's threatened. Right? Impressive. Nature's napalm, basically. Well, why didn't they use it against us on the road? Maybe they didn't consider you a threat. Not likely. Think they wanted us while our blood was still warm. They were totally uninterested in our dead. Your men that were taken are probably still alive, just like my father. Yeah, but why would they want us alive? I mean, what's the point? Trust me, you don't want to know. The real mystery is how these things ever got so big. Even in the Mesozoic era, insects were never this large. Well, your father and Transgen Tech may have a thing or two to do with that. All right, look, you two have told me everything that there is to know about this dragon wasp thing, except how do I kill it? Well, piercing their armor is impossible. A well-placed knife in the wing plate might be effective. Maybe you could just jump on his back. Yeah. So that's it? I mean, other than its inherent design flaw in the natural defense mechanism. Once the two reactants are mixed, this thing is basically a walking chemical bomb. So tell me this. Heh. If I can detonate a small amount of explosives in just one section of the hive, could that cause a chain reaction that would destroy the entire thing? Well, if it's in close proximity, I'm pretty sure it would, yeah. It's not likely, not with the amount of weapons you have available. Not in this small a village. Oh, you don't know Jaguar like I do. Trust me. Okay, well, let's get this thing inside. All right, I'll help you this once. Then we got to check on the others. Oh, this is disgusting. Meyers, check the perimeter. Beastman, have you come to set your spirit free? Are you ready to experience the pleasures of the flesh? I'm just here to talk about tomorrow. Tomorrow can wait till tomorrow. Tonight's offering protects this village. Tonight, we celebrate. Hey, I don't party when I got men in danger. You worry too much. Drink, unless you're scared. No, thanks. Drink, Beastman! Share in our sacred celebration! Ahem. Delicious. Are you feeling fiery venom running through your veins? Ahem. You're looking woozy. Do you need some rest, Beastman? Hmm! Nah, nah, I'm fine. In fact, I think I'm going to, uh, enjoy the pleasures of the flesh myself. Get me someplace I can pass out, quick. Beastman! Beastman! Welcome back. How long have I been out for? It's morning. Come on. What happened to you? I was drugged. Are we in any danger? Beyond the obvious? Uh, I can't be sure, but... I mean, I hope I'm just being paranoid, but... I think they're planning on sacrificing us any minute here. What? You know, to ward off the wasps. Well, what the hell are we gonna do? Can either one of you tell me why it is the wasps seem to avoid this village? Yeah. In a word, cocaine. Specifically, coca paste. It has the essential oils in it which repel the bugs and get rid of them, kind of like citronella. It's not the voodoo that's keeping the wasps away. It's the coca paste. Ah, finally someone's saying something that makes sense around here. Tell me this. Is there any way that we can actually get the bugs to come here? You're serious? Oh, yeah, I'm dead serious. Is there something we can do to eliminate the effects of the cocaine, besides all of this hocus-pocus crap? There might be a way. Do you remember Peru? The adrenal glands. The adrenal glands of the wasp secrete a pheromone that attracts other wasps. All we need is a few molecules. And once we have that, it should spread, and all the bugs within a few miles should feel it right away. Perfect! All right, let's get the hell out of here. Come on, let's find the others. Hey! Jaguar! What the hell is this? I told you you owed me four souls. That was the price for our protection and your assistance. All right! All right, fine. This is the way you want to do it? All right. But these are my men! And nobody touches my men but me! Give me the knife. Okay. Complete the sacrifice. Appease the hunger of Los Bichos Diablo. Beastman, you're taking too long! Don't worry. Fire! What have you done? No! No! No! Gina! Gina! Meet us at the far side of the compound! Go! Go! Rhonda! Gina! Where's Rhonda? I don't know. She was right behind me. Come on. All right. I'm almost out of ammo, man. What if they kill her? They're not gonna kill her. We're gonna get her back. I'm know where the stash is. Follow me. Let's go. Okay. Yes! God, looks like they're preparing for war. Favorite pastime. What do you want me to do? Uh, start filling up your bag with that C-4 right there. Meyers! What else? That's it. Go. Come on. Go! So tell me how you get these, uh, glands here to start working. They've been working ever since we took them out. And the longer they stay out, the worse it's gonna get. Listen. Is that what that sound is? The C-4 all set? Set and ready to go. Beastman! Release the girl! Give me one good reason! 'Cause if you don't, I'll blow up your whole operation! I got the entire perimeter rigged with C-4! You're bluffing! Oh, yeah? What's this, huh? Release the girl and you can keep your village and your cocaine! But if you don't, it all goes up in flames, I swear to God! And you'll leave this place? You'll never see me again! Oh. Hey, Jaguar! Eat this! Let's go! Move! Los Bichos Diablos! Beastman! Ocupado! I never said I wouldn't still blow the place up. Rhonda! Damn! Gina, you okay? You hurt? I already lost my father to this damn place. Now I've lost my best friend, too. Hey, hey! She would have never come here if it weren't for me. And now she's gone, and so is your entire team. I'm still here. This is all my fault. It's not your fault! That's what we're here for. We're trained for this type of crap. What? Yeah. Mansquito, megashark, sand sharks. Any kind of shark really. Cut it, Meyers. We know where Rhonda is. We located the hive. We're gonna save her. We're gonna save my team. Beastman! You think he's still coming after us? Hell, yeah. He's not a live and let live kind of guy. More like a live and let die. James Bond. It never ends. Voodoo priestess? What are you doing? Gonna take the C-4 and set the bridge. No, no, no, no, we can't waste it. We gotta find something else. Here! Here! Nature's napalm from the bug. It'll work. Oh, it better work. Go! Go! Yeah! You're going to suffer a fate worse than death! All right, we got two options. We can take the jeep over back to base camp for reinforcements or go it alone. John, we got men on the ground. And my father's out there and Rhonda. Plus very little time. All right, we go it alone. What the hell's that? Coca leaves courtesy of the Garinagu. Aw, Gina, I don't think that this is the time for that kind of thing. Don't you remember what kept the wasps away from the village? The essential oil of the coca leaf. Yeah, but don't you have to chew that? No, just crush it and rub it onto your skin. It'll work, trust me. Won't that still get absorbed? Maybe. We've got a long way to go, and those things could come at any time. Trust me, it's the lesser of two evils. All right. Hey, this stays off the report, too, got it? Oh, yeah, got it. At least if we die, we'll die happy. Paulo! Gather your men. Today, we are going hunting. Meyers, how much further? Just under six clicks. We're halfway between boogie man and the hive. All right, time to get you strapped up, Gina. What does that mean? Means you get a gun. Hey, that bug repellent's working. You got some more? Nature's remedy. Meyers, check the rear. You ever used a gun before? No. All right. Well, first thing is, grab a hold of it. Go ahead, grab it. Do I have to? Do you want to live? Here, take the gun, all right? This is very easy. This is your safety. There's already a bullet in the chamber ready to fire. Go ahead, try and pull the trigger. See? Nothing happens. I take the safety off, if you squeeze that trigger now, a bullet's gonna come flying out the barrel of this gun and kill whatever's in front of it, understand? So safety on, doesn't fire. Safety off, kill whatever's in front of you. Simple as that. Got it? That's it. You know, I've been trying to figure out what it is with you since we've been here. It's like an intense sadness or profound disillusionment or both. Is this you talking or the coca? Probably both, but maybe it's the jungle. This place can drive a person mad. You know that, right? Look, you've been in this jungle long enough to know that it can do any manner of things to a man or a woman. So what did it for you? Obviously, this isn't your first time with Jaguar and the Garinagu. Nope. And by the looks of today, it won't be my last, either. But, uh... you know, a lot of men, they were lost on my watch. It's my responsibility to get them back or stay here with them. What do you mean? Look, I don't really know if I'm supposed to leave this jungle, or if I want to leave this jungle. Come on, you can't really go from days like today to shopping at your local 7-Eleven, right? I mean, uh... My transfer papers were up. I was supposed to go home day after tomorrow. I didn't want to. And when I saw you, well, I realized I wasn't gonna have to. Right. Well, from my end as a scientist, I only believe in empirical realities, things that you can see. Yeah, you spend enough time out here, you see a lot of things that make you question what's real and unreal. But I still don't believe in any of that hoodoo-voodoo bullshit, and I never will. Well, don't tell me it was the cocaine, either, 'cause no cocaine in the world is that strong. Just ask Tony Montana. Hey, hey, Scarface! Tony Montana'd be proud. I'm learning. You know how to handle that thing. Boss, we got a problem. We got company. All right, well, let's move out. I think I hear something up ahead. Well, besides six-foot-long wasps, there's about a dozen critters in this jungle that we don't want to run into. Maybe it was a howler monkey. No, it was a Maya coral snake, the most deadly snake in Central America. Unh! Let's move out. This is it. Finally. "Transgen Tech. " This is where my father was three days ago. This is why we're here. Transgen Tech. Careful. You may not like what you find in there. Come on, Gina, we gotta get going! One minute! Ugh. They're uglier when they're young. Gina, come on! What's taking you so long? Well? You were right about me not liking what I found. I'm more concerned what's gonna find us soon. Getting close to the hive. Two more clicks south by southwest. We gotta get moving. This stuff is wearing off. I can't even smell it anymore. That's the last of it. Try not to sweat it all off. Yeah, right. Whoo! You know, guys, I'm feeling pretty good considering. Oh, yeah, I got to admit. I mean, I'm feeling a little bit of an energy boost myself here. Whoo, how you feeling, Gina? Hey, Gina? I'm good. I just had a bit of a zone-out. I'm good. Hive's not far from here. Let's, uh... Let' double time it, come on! They were here not long ago. Let's go. Is this a bad time to tell you I'm allergic to bee stings? Don't worry, Meyers. Only the females have stingers. You were actually listening. Does that mean the... the other half still do? No. Most of the drones are male. Only a small percentage of them are female, except for the... The what? The queen. All right, let's get moving before the drugs wear off and Meyers loses his nerve. Meyers? Left or right? Left about 100 meters. I think... I think the coca leaf's wearing off. We don't have much time. Let's pick up the pace. Is he still alive? Technically, yes, but I don't know if he'll ever wake up again. Aah! Down! Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh! What the hell was that? Now we know why they wanted us alive. They're using human bodies as hosts for their young. So those things, they're in all of my men? There must be more chambers. There's gonna be dozens. But these are Jaguar's men, so we must be getting close. Well, let's move. Rhonda! Rhonda? Gina, Gina, we gotta go. No, she's fine. She's fine. There's no helping her right now. Rhonda, can you hear me? She's fine. Come on, wake up. Rhonda? It's okay, it's okay! I'm gonna get you out of here! Where am I? Where am I? We're here! We're here! We're gonna get you out of here! You're fine. You're fine, you're fine. It's okay. Gina? Gina? What's wrong? What's wrong? My chest! I can't breathe! I'm out of ammo! Oh, God. I'm sorry. Okay, here, here, here. It's okay. It's okay. Gina? Gina? Look at me. Look at me. I would have done the same thing, all right? If it was one of my men, I would have done the same thing, okay? Boss, found Humphries. Come on, come on. Your father! Come on! Dad! Dad! Dad? Dad? Can you hear me, Dad? Dad? Gina. Is it really you? What are you doing here? I came here to get you, Dad. Help me get him up. There's no way he's going with us. He's got one of those things in him. No, he's fine. His pulse is normal. The other guy's pulse was racing. He's fine. You're positive? Yeah, he's fine. Help me get him up. Can you walk? I think I can. Good, 'cause you may need to run. Let's go. Come on! Oh, my God! All right. We're gonna blow this whole chamber, the rest of the colony with it. How much C-4 you got left? Two bricks. How about you? A dozen. Okay, great. Let me see. Wait a minute. This isn't C-4. This is cocaine! Cocaine? It's a long story, Dad. Are you sure? Positive. How was I supposed to know? It all looks the same. There's no way we got enough ordnance to blow this place. Actually, we do. If we can get them all into the same chamber, we can start a chain reaction using their chemical spray. Nature's napalm, remember? All right, yeah. But how do we get them all to this same chamber? I have one adrenal gland left. You've had that with us the whole time? How come they haven't been following us? It was surrounded by cocaine. They couldn't detect it until now. You're a genius. Hear that, Dad? I have my moments. Only one problem. That oil's wearing off. We go anywhere near that queen, they'll swarm us. Damn. You got any leaves left? Damn! But I do happen to have of super concentrated coca paste. Good news is, it's super potent. The bad news? It's super potent. This stays off the report? You got that. Gina, you and your dad lay low here! Meyers, get over here! I got my C-4 in my bag. Let's go plant it. I found your glasses, Dad. Thank you, my dear. So you gonna finally tell me what you were doing out here? They told me we were only doing theoretical research on pharmaceutical applications. I was promised repeatedly that there would never be any actual specimens grown. I was a fool. Transgen Tech never intended to do anything with my research except this. Who is Transgen Tech? I'm not really sure. I know they have vast resources. They'll do anything to keep me quiet. And they may have connections to the military. The military? Does that surprise you? No, nothing surprises me anymore. They have stations scattered throughout the jungle. It took me three months to find the hydra where the first horrible creatures were born. You shouldn't have come looking for me, Gina, but I'm glad you did. All right, C-4's set. Meyers, you get them out of here. All right, John, yeah, okay. Go! What are you doing? Someone's gotta stay behind and make sure this gets done. I'll give you three minutes to get clear and then this place blows. You understand? But you're following right after us, right? No. I only have one man left alive. All the rest of them are in here. I can't leave them behind! You know, if a Navy captain can go down with his ship, I can go up with my men. It's gonna be okay, huh? It's all right. It's gonna be okay. This is the right thing. Okay? Okay? Okay. Get them out of here, Meyers! Go! Someone's coming. In here, quick. Got you now, Beastman. It's time to pay up. You killed my doula! Now you're going to pay with your life! Yeah? Well, when my hand comes off this detonator, this entire place is gonna blow. So I guess you're gonna go with me. Oh, Beastman. It seems as if the spirit of the jungle has led us both to the same destiny. But... Meet you on the other side, Jaguar! No! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Let's go! He's changing. No! No! No! I'm okay, I'm okay! Gina, what's going on? He's fine. He's fine. Why wasn't he affected then? I don't know, but he's fine. I guess they weren't interested in an old man like me, or maybe my hearing aid stopped them. Well, Meyers, what are you gonna put in that report of yours? Most of it's classified, but... John Hammond was a good friend. He was a hero. But he was every part of this jungle. It'll be all right. I wish I hadn't slapped him. You slapped him? I'm sure he loved it. I don't know about you two, but I'm ready to get the hell out of this damn jungle. You? Really? Yeah. What about Transgen Tech? What about the other stations? What if there are worse bugs than these? That's classified. I haven't eaten in three days. Can we do it tomorrow? All right, Dad, let's go home.
