The police see the dents and compares with my tires. Do these things. Okay. But the next time, deals with things alone, right? What happened tonight? Violated a person. I asked what happened tonight! Okay! Wine of the party of Jackson, around 8 hours. Stopped at the bar to take a glass, before closing. We play darts. I lost both games. And then we were, directly, home.

This has to be air what, which usually draw, "an establishment with a toilet vomiting and stains on shirts. " And I laugh me that. Part the "usual" was the most ironic. It was ironic. But I have to give reason for her good sense. Any faction that government will trust expensive military equipment, weapons that shoot 550 shots per minute, deserves a trial your common sense. She is right. But, desperately. And what I saw, came here and she won again. So? What about this drink, "cowboy"? This is the music! Anything with rhythm.

Get down! Kill him, kill him again! Should have killed him. Because he walked ago to you, sir? He has not for evil. Is only confusing. He wants to Jake. Captain Gabriel? Everything changed that day. Where is Captain Gabriel? Is coming. He said I would die. He promised. He comes. You see... Andy? Alto, soldier! How are you, Jake? I spent well. Disappear from among us, friend. Without you fired. The Erika did not accept this very well. I think something happened in important, where we were. It is the Holy Land. First I thought it had caught flu, or something. And all these changes, you know... to happen. I do not know where they come from, but it is powerful. One type, Malick, shoot me in the chest and hurt. Hurt with 'fuck you, fuck, but the next day... The next day I swear I could head had not been bitten by a mosquito. The Erika think you are "The Chosen". Only one can be "The Chosen", right? These things are hard.

I only know that this "thing" to start up the soul. You eat the heart and the mind, slowly. Faster in some, than in others. So it is nothing of you. I saw the "thing" in that place, for 10 years. I saw it running... among young people "marines" as a sheet of paper. I had to slaughter it with two magazines. One not enough. It seemed a kind of beast of darkness the way to the bottom the meat of it. Not something you would recall, but it is something you never forget. Sands that have been in hell, the rest of my life, also managed to maintain the "thing" there. But now, the hell returned to home. I love this story! Hello? Are you Carol? Hello, dear.

Do not see much TV here. TV, movies... I? I like the actors seriously. Before becoming politicians. Types such as Steve McQueen, John Wayne, Charles Bronson, Toshiro Mifune and Steve McQueen. - Said McQueen twice. - I like to say his name. It has maps of the stars here? And they are updated. Updated? You are saying that they lived stars here? For years it has been a place of fashion. But this is in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, but it's so like. Have you seen any? A star, I mean? The Lance Henriksen was here two nights. The guy who did "Alien, the 8th passenger"? Yes and he was nice. What up! It's time for my application? That is what we think? Executioners? A part of me is hope they are. Perhaps your will to fight. But you see more soldiers in than animal and I think can help us. I can not help you. I think I can.

If wearing a t-shirt and some microscopic shorts, We could swear that was Daizy of the "Three Dukes. " Why was it me? I was a boy and she a girl. I could be watching a game or polishing my Mustang for 68, she came near me, gave me a wet kiss and said: "You love me? All the damn time, she knew what was the response, but it had to ask. One day, I was having with her and said: "Why when I'm lost in my thoughts, you gotta do me that question? " And you know what she said? Looks like it's time. Shotgun! Ready? One. . two... three! Hello, Jake. Now I gotta go, but we find ourselves, briefly. - Are you hurt? - Are you kidding? I love this type of action. It makes me out of bed in the morning. - How? - Two. Maybe three. The Clay?

Thomas Fuller said that. Good advice. These sheep are to cloud the way you, Jake. I still want to be like them. Had the opportunity to Flee with the Ford but did not, does it? Let's see if we can find Instincts these with some basic training. Clay, remember when we were kids and he had robots, those who gave punch? There was a blue and a yellow dvamos and punched each other without stopping, until the head of jump. And then, would it. Clearly, then, just bring back the head. Jake! Jake, get back here! Jake! I used to hate that attitude of macho men. But now it seems that there is something Strangely attractive about it. It is clear that the male ego can be an ugly manifestation of power. The never ask indication of the directions. T ask for help with the directions, do you, Clay? You know, Jake did it. And close the lid of the toilet. Good morning, General.

Yes and then came to the surface as clean and pure, as the day they were born. This... this hurts! I know. Sometimes it hurts me too. No problem. It is a change. All the changes hurt. Erika, come with me. I know we combat this... We can not. It is too late. Now, is already within us. Please Erika, come with me! We can be free, we can take care of each other. No! No! Come on! No! What? I'm tired of being controlled by more annoyed mercenary in the world. Come on, let's go. No. Enough. We do not provide for this. Are you the rounds as a ninja for hire.

Waiting, watching, waiting for dropped our guard, caught us by our weakness. Seems like we have to walk nozzles in the feet, Gail. It was always my Kenny said nozzles in the feet. Trust me when you speak large green heads, mosey bodies as carrots, fingers that shine... No matter. They are here. And we have to learn to deal with them. Wow! Have you seen the "El chupacabras", the chupador of goats? You have broken the rules, Lawrence. And much, so you can see. Saw a woman in... - Three, three women? - It is the same man! And has a logo or three. Here comes an update Elvis on, Lawrence. My name is Gabriel. It's Jake. Jake is Gabriel. Jake? Jake... It is a good name. I will take a while to get used to me, after you call Lawrence. Going back to change, soon? I am a soldier. I am a man. Yes A man who is having a difficult day. And it will get worse. Why? Did the Men in Black? When you much more from where this came from. Wood... I have to work, because... I have to continue to try to be a good worker. Where I'm about to feel what you feel now, I think a story that my Kenny used to. An old Cherokee grandfather was talking with his grandson, on the battles and hatreds that exist within people. He said that there were two wolves within each of us. One wolf is the bad wolf, the wolf of evil. Is anger, rage, hatred, envy, inferiority, superiority and false pride. And the other wolf is good. You love, tenderness, peace, serenity, compassion, faith... And they fight this battle until the end. And the boy thought the matter for a moment and said: "But, grandfather, which of the wolves win '? The old Cherokee said: "Well, that is food. " It is that food. - He was here. - The Ford is coming. They want us dead. We have to protect. When you leave and find our place, will never find us. We fight now! Just with this. Have you followed is too time on this hunt. - He does not provide for one of us. - He is almost ready. Start to think back like him. A human need. The revenge is a need human. I will not let it interfere in our survival. Our survival is in force and not in their extermination. Our future is in his hands. Not in the other, or in your. I find Jake. Wait for me in the woods. Stay alert, okay? Faras what to do when the find? ... no human power would relieved our alcoholism. What God could and would if they wanted. I am sure you all know, I am not very good in this thing group's support. But any excuse to leaving home is good. Better yet, is the anniversary one of ours. It is the Bonn which is 46 years this month. Good, bonne! Happy Birthday. Happy birthday, Bonn. Thanks. Ready to listen? It is hard to believe who have passed 46 years since last drink. And you were just a glimmer of hope... the eyes of your parents. And I have the luck hold of me here and see them succeed... See how we can fuck everything. Understand the term, Leo? I do not drink! Sorry, you okay? Sorry. Just... I'm looking for a person. We stopped a red signal and tight that not a few bucks. And ahead of us stopped a truck very full of chickens within a bunch of cages Wood, and decided that we would release them, give them freedom. The poor were arrested. Everyone is looking at the windows and from what we, and had chickens to fly about everywhere on the street. What happened was that that we... At least, I am not on fire. - Cartridges? - Two dozen, maybe. The same, maybe less. I have seen you take one! And I got, but she left a limp. These girls are fast. What the hell is going on here? Guys, please, go down the window there in the background. Not yet responded to my question. Who are you? Put it under the window now. Leo, sit down! I think I will call the sheriff. - He is drunk? - No, stupid! Anyone here knows Gabriel is Jake? If you are referring to the former Lawrence Talbot, yes. I know Jake Gabriel. This is the second person to question it today. And we will not be the last. If the come and it is changed, do not hesitate. Where is the Sheriff Harris? Is the great-grandfather Harris, unfortunately. What are you doing to my car? General Ford, we can solve this battle here or outside, depending on the amount low that you have. I knew that had to be drugs involved. It is not drugs. There is, of course, the shit I used to smoke. Are some military experience, are not they? You always go all the sanding, trying to invent a machine perfect for fighting. But, as always, everything we do is corrupting the human species, creating a monster military. The fault is all yours. What happened? He was a little to the left, therefore, gave him a right. Bergman, we will intervene. You cover this half and I cover the other half. And take the "thing" for the street, running. - It will be complicated. - Wait. Are you sure you saw two outside? - I! - Good. For a moment, I thought we could have problems. Is increasingly difficult to pointing to these things. Sergeant! Tactics, General. Outflank the enemy is the most basic. Do you know karate, honey? Because your body will kick. Know how many soldiers the same you saw that site? Lying on the floor, looking at me as if it were your last hope? But you are not looking well for me now, do you? Want to find out? How can? How you sense of humor in the midst of all this pain? I had one with two years. Once, fell on his knees to laugh. Unable to cry, was a laugh. Do you think he would recognize me now? Do you think someone recognize me now? Leo, get up! What happened? - Hit me? - No, but I thought about it. Get up. What the hell? - Who are they? - What did I tell you? - Are extra-terrestrial! - Extra-terrestrial? Extra-terrestrial... You say, woman? - America needs us. - Go for it! Let the military go.
