You tell me directly what you've been doing! - Well? Or I'd have you out of that corner if you was 50 Pips, and he was 500 Gargerys. I... I've been down to hear the carols. Carols, is it? Perhaps if I weren't a blacksmith's wife and a slave with an apron never off only should I been to hear the carols. But too busy am I bringing you up by hand. - Why do I do it?. - I don't know, sister. I don't... Was it I brought me this being your mother? This house, this apron and him. That's all. I hope you sang your heart out, old chap. Glad to I gave it out, Joe. I'm hungry, boy. I'm hungry. Please, sir! Please, sir! Nice fat cheeks though, I'd munch them, eh? - What is your name, boy. - Pip... What? Come on, give it mouth! Pip. Pip, sir. Pip! Pip! Well, boy? - What's in the bottle, boy? - Brandy, sir. I need to eat to live. You have no one with you? - I brought no one with me, sir. - Nor give no one the office to follow you? No! Oh, no, sir. - Pip, is it? - Yes, sir. I am hunted and condemned to death, Pip. They'll come for me. - I'm glad you enjoy it. - Did you speak? I said I was glad you enjoyed that. Well... thank you, my boy. I do. - Another out there. - Since last night. Did you hear then? Compeyson must be out. - Excuse me, sir? - Compeyson is out. I'll put him down like a bloodhound. Curse this bloody iron on my leg. Give me that file, boy. Merry Christmas. And for which may the Lord may he make us truly, truly grateful. Amen. You hear that? You be grateful. Especially dear boy to them which brought you up by hand. Oh is it that the young are never grateful? - Naturally vicious. - True. I must say anyone looking for a moral for the young will not find it in today's sermon. No, indeed. Indeed we felt as much it was well chosen. Now, if I'd be in the position to enter into a fit subject... - Look at pork alone. - There's a subject. - If you want a subject, look at pork. True, sir. Many a moral for the young might be deduced from the text. You listen to this! Swine were the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of swine is put before us as an example to the young. Think what you've got to be grateful for, You would have been disposed of for a few shillings. Yes, mam. Disposed... And then Dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw and he would have whipped you under his left arm and shed your blood with a penknife with his right. No bringing up by hand then. Not a bit of it. Uncle... Uncle, what is it? Are you all right, uncle? Tar! Tar? Why, how ever could tar come there? Here you are. Come on, look sharp. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen but I am on a chase for Queen and country and I want the blacksmith. Joe! The lock of one of them goes wrong and the coupling don't act pretty. They are in the marshes still. We will try to get clear of them before dusk. Would you care for a little brandy, sergeant? Wine, I think, mum. Afterwards, sergeant, I rather thought that perhaps... Well, some of us may have the inclination to come down with the soldiers and see what comes of this hunt. - No objections here. Mrs Joe don't mind we'll see those villains caught, Pip? Come on! There! Surrender! Arrest him! I took him! I give him up to you! There's nothing to be particular about. Handcuffs there! I took him and he knows it. That's enough for me. Take notice, sergeant, this man tried to murder me. I dragged him back here. He's a gentleman, if you plese, this villain. And now, the Hulks has got its gentleman back again, through me. I should have been a dead man if you had not come up. He's a born liar and he'll die a liar. Look at his face, isn't it written there? Let him cast those eyes on me. I defy him to do it. That's how he looked when we were tried together. - He never looked at me. - Not much to look at. - You! - Stop it! I told you he would murder me if he could! Enough of this! Company! March! Look, I took some wittles off, up at the village, where the church stands. - You mean stole? From the blacksmith. It was some broken wittles... and a dram of liquor and a pie. I'm sorry you missed such articles. Especially the pie. Come on! How does he know I was the blacksmith? Come on, old chap. It's only a dream that's taken all of you. It was real, Joe. Always seem so. But this is a true fear, Pip. Me hold in your hand and you're safe. and sound and warm in your bed. Look like them poor creatures. No comfort for them tonight, don't you reckon. What a scholar you are, old chap. - Ain't you? - I should like to be. Why, here's a J and a O equal to anything! But read the rest, Joe. The rest, eh, Pip? Why, here's three Js and three Os... and three J-O... Why Joes, in it, Pip! My dear Joe, I hope you're quite well and I hope I shall soon be able for the teach you, Joe, and then we shall be so glad when I am apprentice to you, Joe what lurks, believe me. Astonishing! You are a scholar. How do you spell Gargery, Joe? - I don't spell it at all, Pip. - But supposing you did? It can't be supposed. Didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me? No, Pip. But you teach me, are you chap? Well... if this boy ain't grateful this day he never will be. Get him ready, mum. Well? What are you staring at? This boy's fortunes may be made today if she favours him. You better make certain she favours you. Get off, boy. Boy, let your behaviour here be a credit to them which brought you up by hand. - What name? - Pumblechook. Quite right. This is Pip. This is Pip, is it? Come in, Pip. Oh, did you wish to see Miss Havisham? If Miss Havisham wished to see me. Which is what she didn't. Remember, Pip. Credit, nothing but credit. Don't loiter, boy! - After you, Miss. - Don't be ridiculous, boy. I'm not going in. Go on! - Who are you? - Pip, ma'am. Pip? R.r Pumblechook's boy. Sometimes I have sick fancies, Pip. I have a sick fancy that I want to see some play. So... So, please... Play! Play! Play! No... No. Are you afraid of me? I'm afraid of my not pleasing you. I should get into trouble with my sister if you would not favour me. - Fetch Estella. - She...? Fetch her. Beggar again. Two jacks. Now we have to go to war. He calls the knaves jacks. How coarse his hands are. And what thick boots. You say nothing of her. What do you think of her? Tell me in my ear. He thinks you are very proud and insulting and very pretty. Anything else? I think I should like to go home now. And never see her again? Though she is so pretty? I'm not sure that I shouldn't like to see her again, but I should like to go home now. - Come back after six days, you hear? - Yes, ma'am. Estella, take him down. Give him something to eat. Let him roam around. Why don't you so cry again? - Because I don't want to. - Yes, you do. Pretty well? Look on your answers! Pretty well? What you mean by pretty well? I mean... pretty well. Don't lose your temper with him, mum. Leave this to me. Boy... What like is Miss Havisham? - Very tall and dark. - Is she, uncle? Good. We are beginning to hold our own, I think, mum. You know so well how to deal with him, uncle. Now, boy... What was she doing of when you went in today? She was sitting in a black velvet coach. Yes, and Miss Estella, that's her niece I think handed her in cake and wine at the coach-window on a gold plate. And we all had cake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat mine, because she told me to. There were four dogs there fighting for veal cutlets out of a silver basket. Can this be true, uncle? The boy was there to play. And this coach... What can the boy mean? Did you ever see her in it? Many times, mum. And what did you play at, boy? We played with flags. Flags? Yes. Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one. Astonishing! What lucks, eh, Pip? But will it make his fortune, uncle? There are plans for him, mum. I am sure of that. Property or his binding to a gentle trade... Promising, mum, highly promising. Come, Pip, at least there was dogs? There are no veal cutlets, at least there was dogs? - No, Joe. - A puppy? Come... and no flags neither, Pip? Old chap, this won't do. Where do you expect to go to? But I couldn't speak how she really was, Joe. It would be... corse. Eh? Why did you teach me to call knaves jacks? Look, Pip... Lies is lies. But I have to go back there, Joe. I have to go back there in six days' time. What would I do when she looks at my boots again? Your own one day. And you will use them well. She grow prettier and prettier, Pip? And prettier. As for you, there is no improvement. Pretty said, my beauty. Pip sings a very pretty song. Don't you, Pip? Perhaps he can entertain us with that. I have heard you the first time you came here. Perhaps you could beat the tact. Well, Pip? It's a song from a forge, ma'am. - Well then. Sing it. Come on, join us. Come. But I'm not supposed to join in. Neither of us. I thought we were supposed to laugh. I do not understand this! It is a blacksmith's song. It is a song to use with your coarse clumsy hands. She's always let me know I'm low. Sometimes she talks to me. Sometimes not. Sometimes she tells me very directly that she hates me. I admire her dreadfully. Pip... Well, it's a good likeness, isn't it? Of what, Pip? The design for a buckle, of course. You are a willing pupil, Pip, most of the time and very particular... most of the time but today look again Pip and you'll see it's a letter D you copied. I'm sure she is object of all your love and duty but I'm instructed to tell you to come tomorrow. And will we be able to see her and inquire about her then? Oh, she does not say that. She does say to come back again. We are only wishing to be informed about her health. Indeed, until we are our own health is undermined. I'm sure Miss Havisham wishes you a speedy recovery. This is the boy Miss Havisham sends for. I have pretty large experience of boys and you are a bad seat of fellows. Now, mind you behave yourself. Come on, she is waiting for you. You are to come this way today. You are to go in there. Don't open the door that are down the corridor. You asked a favour of me? It is an instruction. You saw my relatives downstairs? Today is my birthday. - Many happy returns... - I don's suffer it to be spoken of. Come. Walk me. What do you think that is? I can't guess what it is, ma'am. The great cake. A bride-cake. Mine. It was brought here a long time ago. On my birthday. Oh, my coming of age. You see this? - It's from him. - Him, ma'am? I received it 20 to nine. Read it. Wheel me around this table. And... did she look in favour on the way you pushed her around? She wishes me to take her further next time. Onto the landing. - Uncle? - Promising, mum, highly promising. - What do you know, Pip? - Sorry, ma'am? In your learning. Not nearly as much as I should like, ma'am. Not nearly as much. And what are you to be? I believe I am to be apprentice to Joe, ma'am. The blacksmith. But I'm a very well pupil and keen to learn everything. You mean something else? Oh, boy, back from the society you go. Joe! - You playes well today, are you? - Joe! She wishes you to come there. She wishes us to come there. There's a plan she has for him. It must be. Or she plans to give him the way she wishes to favour him after all the visit to his main there. It's only Joe she wishes to see. He's to go up town on his own? Him? I think it would be best to go to in your Sunday clothes, Joe. My hat and whole? There more company I might think for. Where do I go? - This is important business then... - When is it to go there? Soon. She knows nothing of times. You'll go tomorrow. Well, Pip, bring the foil. This will not do. You have raised the boy with the intention of taking him for your apprentice. Is that so, Mr. Gargery? That was long be looked forward to between us. Yes, Pip? Does he like the trade? You know it were looked forward to betwixt us It is a wish of his own heart, ma'am. Begging your pardon, ma'am. Is it what's to happen then? It's time. It's a business open to black and soot and such like. But Pip makes no objections to that. And now he can help me keep the pot boiling, so to speak. Pip is on the premium here. Five-and-twenty guineas. Take it to your master, Pip. Estella, show Mr. Gargery way. Pip, stay behind. So, Pip... there's a change going on. And Estella will soon be gone. - Where? - Abroad. To be educated for a lady. Out of reach. How do you feel about that? I wish her well. Don't you think that you're losing her? - I might come again? - No. Gargery is your master now. You have no more attachments here. Do you? You're free to go. Hello, young fellow. Who let you in? It does not matter who let me in. I was sent for and now I'm leaving. Didn't she take a fancy to you then? - Who? - Miss Havisham. I'm on trial too. My father is her cousin. I have no more business in this house. Excuse me. Oh, yes, you do. Come fight. - Fight? - Come to the ground. Break the rules and you go through the preliminaries. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Hang on. You must have a reason. I've given you one. - That means you won. - Can I help you? No, no. That's quite all right. - Good afternoon. - Same to you. You may kiss me if you like. Goodbye. You're to be his master? You? I cannot believe that is to be is fortune. She must... she must want something within. There must be something! You're holding it. So his fortune is to be mine. Tied to a blacksmith. Well, there is progress for us all! The boy is to be bound, bound out of hand. Come, boy. And now we'll have a dinner over 25 guineas. Joseph, your apprentice. That's been so looked forward to betwixt. Eh, Pip? "The said apprentice shall faithfully serve his master, "and shall not waste the goods of his said master, "nor apprend himself from his said master service day or night unlawfully "but in offerings as a faithful servant he shall behave himself." Now your master mean to set fire, don't him? Must say a prayer to the devil to get it going. You look close for the devil lives in it. Little piece of hell in the flames. - what do you want here, Orlick? - A job, Mr. Gargery. A job? Right, Pip? Go to it. Right, Pip. You certainly turned yourself to it, Pip. When I come in to the forge, anyone can see me turning to it in earnest. Biddy... I want to be a gentleman. Oh, I wouldn't if I was you. I want to lead a different sort of life. - Don't you think you're happy as you are? - Don't be absurd. I didn't mean to be. - I only want you to do well. - I used to want that too. Now I have to be a gentleman. I could try to settle down, to accompany Joe, to keep company with you even. Even? As I am not over-particular myself? See how I'm going on? I'm glad you give me your confidence. I shall always tell you everything, Biddy. Till you are a gentleman. Hello. - Where are you two going? - Home. Where else should we be going? Well then, I'll see you home. You will have to tell him again. We don't need seeing home. Let Biddy speak. Pip, I'm afraid he likes me. But hes always loved you, Biddy. Oh, he begins to dance at me whenever he catches my eye. But it makes no difference to you, does it? She's done the handsome thing for you Pip, but when Miss Havisham done the handsome thing for you she called me back to say that were all. - But Joe...! - All, Pip! Since the day of my being bound I have never thanked Miss Havisham or asked after her, or shown that I remember her. Today is her birthday, Joe! The day which... Very well, then. But no more trips after this one. Sure you're not going to favour only one of us then? And what do you mean to say? - If youn Pip has a half-holiday do the same for Old Orlick - What'll you do with a half-holiday if you get one? Oh, what'll he do with that? I just want get out of that forge presently. I'll do as much with half-holiday as him. Why? Pip's going up town. Well then, Old Orlick's going up town. Tain't only one can go up town? I'm going up town to set this house. I'm paying a visit to Havisham. And I may wish to call on Biddy! You shall not! Well, some and their up town then. Now master, come! No favouring in this shop. Be a man. No more talk till you calm yourself. Now, master. You stick to your work as well as most men. Half-holiday for all. Fool! You are a rich man to waste wages on a great idle hulker like him? I wish I was his master. You'd be everyone's master if you could. Let her alone. I'm a match for rogues like you. You're a foul shrew, Mother Gargery. - What did you say? - Let her alone! - What name did he give me? - Shrew! And there's more too. To hear him. And you swore to defend me! Don't stand by! Your work's done here. Come for your wages tomorrow. See the trouble you've caused? We lose a journeyman and all cause you have fancy to go up town and can't make an end on it. Where's your invitation? There's being no more. She's made them done it. It's as you was. I attend to Miss Havisham now I hope you want nothing. You'll get nothing. No, indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing very well in my apprenticeship and am always much obliged to you. And Estella? - Ma'am? - Do you wish to inquire about her? Prettier than ever. Admired by all who see her. I'm glad. Do you like your trade? So you object to the black and the soot after all? I hate it. I want no more of any of it. But you are bound, Pip. Yes. Goodbye. Sister? Sister! Sister! His? Oh...no! Oh, no, I'm sorry! Oh! I'm sorry! Whoever is guilty they will find him, Joe! I did nothing, Pip. Absolutely nothing. I just wanted to... the surrender seems like. Him! Him! This is a man who last had a quarrel with her He lost his job for it too. She quarrelled with everyone around here too ten thousand times. Anyways, I've been about town all evening in different companies, even Joe seen me at Blue Boar. There's nothing against me. You are in need of information. I saw an occasion to help. Truly an orphan now, Pip. Mr. Wopsle might have come this way of living and Mrs Joe was in great need of you, Biddy. As we are. Welcome to our establishmnet, Biddy. Come, Pip, go to it! Joe... Joseph Gargery? My name is Jaggers and I'm a lawyer in London. I have unusual business to transact with you. Concerning this young man. You do not object to cancel his indentures at his request and for his owngood? You would not want anything for so doing? Lord forbid that I should. Is that no? - Yes, it is. - Really? Very well. Recollect the admission you have made and do not try to go from it presently. I am instructed to communicate to him that he will come into a handsome property. Further, that is the desire of the present possessor of that property that he be immediatelyremoved from his present sphere of life and from this place and be brought up as a gentleman. In a word, as a young fellow of great expectations. May we ask who is this liberal benefactor? No. Not only is it a profound secret, but more importantly it is a binding condition that you do not inquire. Accepted by you? - I have no objection. - I should take not! I am empowered to mention that it is the intention of this person to reveal their identity at first hand by word of mouth to yourself. In the meantime you will please consider me your guardian. Thank you. I'm paid for my services, or I shouldn't render them. Now, when will you come to London? You should have some new clothes to come in. Shall I leave you 20 guineas? Well, Joseph Gargery, you look dumbfoundered. I am. Now, it's understood that you want nothing for yourself but what if it was in my instructions to make you a present as compensation? - Compensation as for what? - The loss of his services. You think money can make compensation for the loss of him? The child what come to the forge and ever the best of friends? I should go to London directly. What a gentle figure, Pip. - This change come so uncommonly quick, Pip. - Hard to get to mine mind. - Pip has hardly believed to get in his. - Daydreams, Biddy. - Come true, Pip. Well, this is a gay figure, Pip. I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss Havisham. And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham! I have seen Jaggers. I know about it. So, you go tomorrow? Yes, Miss Havisham. And I thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you. And you are adopted by a rich person whose name is not revealed? Yes, Miss Havisham. And you are to be tutored by Mr. Matthew Pocket, a cousin of mine - and of Sarah here. - In Hammersmith, ma'am. You may go now, Sarah. I... often wonder of... the whereabouts of... Estella, and how she might look upon me now. She will think you fit company, Pip. She will appreciate the change in you. And see you very differently. Good luck, Pip. - I'll follow you down there. - No, Joe. I'll say goodbye now. There you are in your suit. Goodbye, Pip. Good luck. I did not expect this day look me in the face, Pip, but... take my hand. As firm as my own. Don't know you. Don't know you. On my soul, don't know you. I've never been in London before. You are an acquaint, Mr. Wemmick? I was new once. Rum to think of now. And the other ways of it now. Them the ways of it. Four of them to be killed tomorrow. In a row. You are a lucky man, Mr. Pip. You have these services already. Mr... Mr, please... Please. Sir, my bill, sir. Now, I tell you once and for all, your bill is in good hands, but if you keep bothering me about it it may flip through my fingers. - Have you paid Wemmick? - Yes, sir. Every farthing. Then mind it doesn't give it back. Mr Pip, how much did the coachman want from Cross Keys? - A shilling. - You think it's rather fair sum? - I don't know. - Exactly. Come on. There's a bill been sent for your accommodation at Barnard's Inn. Mr. Pocket's rooms, not you tutor, mind. His son. You'll find Mr. Pocket senior in Hammersmith, and you'll find your credit good in these places, Mr. Pip. And if you're out running the constable with it I'll pull you up. Naturally your allowance. There. It's a very liberal one. I'm sure you still manage go wrong somehow. Who are those, Mr. Jaggers? Clients of mine after they were taken down from the gallows. They went wrong. Slop! Mr. Pip? Mr. Herbert arriving any minute now. The fact is, I have been out on your account. I can't shake hands but we'll remedy once we're inside. Please, come in. Allow me to lead the way. I'm rather bare here but I hope you'll make out tolerably well. Your bedroom furniture is hired for the occasion. But I trust it will answer the purpose. Not what you have in mind, I'm sure but I have my own bread to earn. My father hasn't anything to give me and I shouldn't be willing to take it if he had. As to our table, you won't find that bad. It will be supplied from the local coffee-house and that the Jagger's instructions at your expense. So we'll dine well, share these chambers alone together and we shan't fight. At least I hope not. You! You forgive me for having knocked you about so. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were bought, the wedding tour was planned out and the wedding guests invited. The day came that the bridegroom having already extracted great sums of money from Miss Havisham, did not. - He wrote her a letter. - Which she received 20 minutes to 9. And she has never since looked upon the light of day. My father tried to tell her he was a bad lad Receiving this advice she ordered my father out of the house. - And when I saw you there... - I too had been sent for. But I came out as badly as my father. If I hadn't, perhaps I should have been provided for. And Estella was adopted by Miss Havisham? To take revange on all the male sex. Adventure you've been on receiving and during your visits there. She's been abroad. I haven't seen her. Pip, may I mention that in London it is not a custom to put a knife in the mouth for fear of accidents and that the spoon is not used over hand but under. That is to get into your mouth better. And save good of attitudes for opening oysters in the part of the right elbow. - Oh, dear me, I'm late again. - Beg your pardon? The proposal of a toast, Pip. To your good fortune and your future in London. To my future in London. I can educate you well enough for your destiny to hold your own with your contemporaries. My contemporaries? Other young men in prosper circumstances. I kno you are the cousin to Miss Havisham. My ties to her are no more than natural and never will be. Now, as to my ties to you, Pip, which will be much more to the point. I will not say I can make you a gentleman. No man that is a true gentleman at heart is ever a gentleman in manner. No varnish can hide the grain of the wood. Your fellow students: Mr. Startop. Mr. Drummle. - Mr. Pip. - How do you do. You know the trouble with this book Mr. Pocket? It weighs too much. It's as much as one can do to pick the thing up. Well, business awaits. He's to the counting house. To report himself. - The counting house? - I look about me, Pip. I'm in a counting house and I look about me to begin insuring ships to employ my capital to swoop tremendous opportunities. Tremendous. Goodbye. I was never quite decided whether to mount to the woolsack or roof myself in with the mitre. Chancellor or bishop. It was a mere question of time. You find the recognition of Odisseus by his father uninvolving Mr. Drummle? A clear reading of it might be more successful. Oh, I doubt it. Your style becomes more elegant, Mr. Pip. Oh, I'm rest right now in strength to be adept. I'm engaged in some practical tuition. Not all of reliance you should lose alltogether. Your instructor tells me you have an arm of the blacksmith. He intended it as a compliment. Good day, sir. I can find him a little to do. I dare say you have to find a great deal to eat. I'm making myself at home at Barnard's Inn, Mr. Jaggers with furniture of one or two little things. - These things however are not so small in price.. - Come, I ask you once? 50 pounds? - Not nearly so much. - 5 pounds then. Let's get to it. Two times five. Three. Four times five. Wemmick! Take Mr. Pip's written orders and give him 20 pounds. I see you're getting on. I told you you would. The man trap is sprang and click! Your call in it. You don't object to an aged parent? No. - Do you always make you way home on foot? - Oh, yes. - It's some distance. - Walworth is some distance from the desk which I have had my legs under all day. - Still, it's quite a stretch. - Oh, yes. Quite a stretch. And now... we are here. You can raise a good salad from the garden to go with that. All communication now cut off. How are you today, Aged? This is Mr. Pip! Come for supper! Just nod away at him, Mr. Pip. That works best. A very good lady named Miss Skiffins, attens him while I'm at work. And Mr. Jaggers knows nothing or never seen the Aged? Never heard of him. The office is one thing, the private life another. Now I will tell you what I have for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got... a stewed steak and a cold roast fowl from the cookshop. The master of the shop is a jury man of some cases there and we let him down easy. Do you often receive... gifts? Oh, yes. I always take them. Condemned men, jury men, Jagger's clients. Their property, Pip. They may not be worse much but after all the're portable. And property. I don't signify it to you with your brilliant outlook but... As to myself my guiding star always is: get hold of portable property. My cabinet of curiosities, Pip. Of a felonious nature. The very pen used in the Attlee forgery case. This raises from two celebrated murder cases. A lock of the victim's hair, found on one of the villains. And this letter here, look, reporting to be the confession of a condemned man. But I know for a fact it is all lies. He never even did it. Now, it is curiosity, don't you think? and Jaggers was involved in all these cases? I give it world of credit. What allow to make him and me so alike? You don't mean you should. It's not personal. It's professional. Only professional. But except this invitation to dinner, you know it tomorrow. And when you dine you'll see he harbours a curiosity all of his very own. Look at his housekeeper. What shall I see? A wild beast tamed. Keep your eye on it. Their poor home with abreast to one another and converse from boat to boat like mates. You cannot hear our conversations because you are always too far behind us. I choose to keep my distance from you both. I find I enjoy the river far more that way. So, you would consider yourself the master in strength and skill of these two gentlemen? That is not a consideration that needs much thought. And what say you two? His superirity is purely in his imagination. This superiority is here in the flesh. - Look! - Come, Mr. Pip, unroll your sleeves and put him to shame. Pip would rather shame him on the Thames, I think. If you talk of strength... I'll show you a wrist. - Master... - Molly, let them see your wrist. Please... Let them see them both. Show them. Come on. There's power here. Very few men have the power of wrist this woman has. It's remarkable what mere force of grip is in these hands. I have never seen stronger, man or woman's... than these. That'll do, Molly. It's half past nine, gentlemen. Time to break up. Pip, stay a while. Mr. Drummle, I drink to you. Pardon me, sir, I understand you're acquainted with Satis House. Yes. With Miss Havisham. Although I'd like to consider myself more than merely acquainted. Your two friends are set off back to Hammersmith on either side of the road. I'm sorry if things got disagreeable. Nonsense. I like the Drummle fellow there. There are two sorts in life, Pip. Beechers and cringers. He's a beecher. There's no doubt about that. Excellent. This arrived before. What are the reasons of her death, Joe? Her state just got slowly worse, see lay down on the bed. And she spoke, Pip. Actually spoke. ''Joe,'' she said, and wants pardon and wants Pip. Pardon, Pip? I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain in the house now, Biddy. Oh, I can't do so, Mr. Pip. I'm going to Mrs Hubble tomorrow. How are you going to live? If you want any money... I'll tell you how I'm going to live, Mr. Pip. I'm trying to get a place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. You are one of those, Biddy, who makes the best of every change. You've proven in every circumstances. I'm not as handsomely as you. I'm not goint to leave poor Joe alone. - Don't you hear me, Biddy? - Yes, Mr. Pip. Not to mention your calling me "Mr. Pip'', which appears to me in bad taste, Biddy. What do you mean? I made a remark respecting my coming down here often to see Joe which you have received with the marked silence. Have the goodness, Biddy, to tell me why. I trust you found the Blue Boar where you come to enjoy your stay. It's so much more suitable for your needs. Goodbye, dear Joe. You're not coming back to the house? No...Joe. Miss Havisham knows I'm here. She sent a letter to the... Blue Boar. She wishes to see me and I must go there. She extends her sympathies, Joe. I wonder what business she has with you. I wonder too. I shall see you soon, Joe. - Biddy. - Goodbye, Pip. Yes? - How did you come here? - On my legs. As more changes than yours, young master. Come in. Come in. It's opposed to my orders to hold the gate open. This is loaded. I'm expected, I believe. Yes. Here I am. Come in, Pip. As if I were a queen. I wished you to come to see me. But who would you wish to see? Call for her, Pip. Who, Miss Havisham? She's here. Call for her. Estella. Call for her. Call! Estella? Estella? Estella! Do you admire her? Then you must love her. Love her. Love her. - I... sent for a carriage. - To Richmond. And I'm to give you my purse, and you are to pay my charges out of it that's settled too. And what else is settled for us? This lady with whom I'm going to live at great expense has the power of taking me about and showing people to me and me to people. I suppose you would be glad of variety and admiration. I'm already glad of admiration, Pip. What place is that? I'm not sure... I think it's Newgate prison. - Are you familiar with it? - As a building, not the wretches inside it. And Orlick was removed by Jaggers now. Who? - The porter of Satis House. - Go on. He wasn't the right man for this post, you understand? You arranged his removal? How do you thrive at Hammersmith? Mr. Pocket is an admirable man. Quite disinterested and independent, I hear. I like that class of men. Do you remember the last spectacle you and I attended together, Pip? Rendition of "Old Clement", I think at that time it was I who was the vocalist. Pip and I had a kind of growing up together, didn't we Pip? Why do you talk of me as if I were your brother or something? You notice that I call these gentlemen by their title. Mr. Drummle, there, for example. Only you do I call by name, Pip. Only you. Thank you, sir. It's generous 18. Oh, if I may, sir. There is number 3, 5 and 8. - Now, this article... - Let me save you the trouble. I will take all of them. Apologies from Mrs Pocket for not attendance. She seems to have problem with a baby in a pair of nutcrackers. How is dear Miss Havisham, Estella? Still as dear. And here's Matthew, never coming near to see how she is. Whilst others with no natural ties whatsoever always seem to be mixing. In fact, Sarah, I'm to write to Miss Havisham regularly to let her know how I feel. She especially wishes to know how Pip and I use each other. She will be especially glad to know that I'm dining here tonight. - She will? - She still recognizes in you, Mr. Pocket, a man above small jealousies and spites. Hurry up now, come on. I have never been so insulted in my life. Did you hear? - You made them look ridiculous. - Hardly an exertion. Pip, you may set your heart at rest that those people will never in hundred years pay regard to Miss Havisham. And there is my hand upon it. You ridiculous boy. I have no intention of being ridiculous. You should have asked before you touched the hand. If I ask, may I kiss your cheek as once did? Yes. If you like. Gentleman, to make the present promotion of good feeling ever predominant among the Finches of the Grove. - Finches of the Grove.! - Marvellous. Herbert, we're dining very expensively tonight. In my confidence in my own resources it might be on my expense. Not the bit of it. You don't have to looked about me. Not when I have capital in mind's eyes. Gentlemen, as you know, it is the solemn duty of this society for members to toast the lady of their acquaintance. Tonight that duty falls to Mr. Bentley Drummle. Gentlemen. In the presence of this company, I pledge myself to... Estella. To Estella! Estella who? - Never mind. - Estella of where? You're bound to say of where. Of Richmond, gentlemen. And... and... her peerless beauty. - To Estella. - To Estella! In my view, it is impudence on the part of this Finch to come down to this grove and propose of a lady of whom he knows nothing. - What you mean by that? - You know where I am to be found. - Pip! - Order, order! I'm calling this grove to order. This must be settled. This grove is the court of honour and we must settle it. He pledges himself to you. Pip, we've been in company together as you know. - We've been introduced. - But acquainted? - Estella will you please turn to me? - I'm writing to Miss Havisham. Oh, how you use me? I'm sure you find it easy to describe. This is an avow, in the lady's hand, that she has had the honour of dancing with Mr. Drummle, on several occasions. This is indeed her hand. I... very much regret that I spoke so heatedly. And spoke more rudely to one of my hosts than was polite. I naturally repudiate the idea that I am to be found. May I? You know he's despised, don't you? - Well? - You know he's a devil in and out. Deficient, ill-tempered, lowering, stupid. Indeed? Why is it that it seems to be your manners which are attracting critique? Because the way you let them hover around you makes me wretched. - He has nothing to recommend him but money. - This is making you foolish, Pip. Then stop throwing your attractions away on boor. I can bear it. - Don't be so proud, Estella. - Proud? In your last breath you reproach me for stooping to a boor. Moths and those sorts of creatures hover around the lighted candle. Can the candle help it? I've seen the looks and smiles you give them this very night. And of the kind... of the kind I thought were only given to me. I do not bestow my tenderness anywhere, Pip. I gave you a warning. Pip, you seem to have forgotten my advice on the subject of the wine glass. You really have been found to conscience emptied. Now let us try to leave this company with some resemblance to the manner in which we joined it. We can walk straight I remember and with some control of our head. - Estella, I must speak with you... - Pip. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Good evening. A fellow should know you don't get drunk at balls. And if he was born to know it, your father should have taught you to do it. Have no worries, sir. No one usurp for your position. - What did he say? - Stay the lowest in the crowd, Drummle! Letter from Jaggers, now. - They are mounting up, Pip. - Upon my life, they are mounting up. Get out! Go stare elsewhere! How is your head? Let the bailiffs come, they'll find Estella already in house possession. She holds everything that is of value to me. Could you... - could you not detach yourself from her? - Impossible. Think of her bringing up and think of Miss Havisham. - Think of what she is herself. - I know it. - So you can't detach yourself... - No! I find that I was thwarted in the matters of my heart. - May I ask who it is? - Name of Clara. - Lives in London? - Yes. And the moment I realize capital I intend to marry her. But you can't marry while they are looking about you. As for myself, Herbert, I find I am looking behind me. I find I'm in the books of every tradesman in London, Mr. Wemmick. Now I find them lying in wait. You shouldn't let such events disturb you, Mr. Pip. Now when you got Mr. Jaggers' attentions to look forward too. I expect he's going to tell me how wrong I've gone. Now, my young friend, I'm going to have a word or two with you. Your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's cashbook. You are in debt of course. Now I don't ask you what you owe because you don't know. As to what you're living at the rate of I dare say you don't know that either. I thought so. Now, take this piece of paper, unfold it and tell me what it is. - It's a banknote for 500 pounds. - That is a banknote for 500 pounds. Today you come of age. That is a present to you on this day in earnest of your expectations from your benefactor. You will draw from Wemmick 125 pounds per quarter. Wemmick? Until the donor of the whole appears. - Congratulations, Mr. Pip. - Yes. That day we must call you Mr. Pip. Congratulations, Mr. Pip. - I must thank my benefactor. - When that person discloses you will thank this person for settling your affairs. I am a mere agent. And when that person discloses my part in this business will cease. And in this business am I designed for Estella? I have nothing else to say. One of the name of Clarriker, a shiping broker is showing extraordinary inclination towards me and I'm to work in his office next week. That's mighty news Herbert, congratulations. And never stop looking about me the strangest thing is the opportunity came to me. It's well deserved. I have written to my father to confound him with the news, and now I should visit Clara and tell her to start to look to the future. - She shows such tenderness towards me, Pip. - Well deserved. To tomorrow. Mr. Wemmick. Thank you for arranging it, Mr. Wemmick. I still say it, serve a friend with money you know no the end of it. Yes, I know your view, never invest in portable property in a friend but I still want to help him make the beginning. Now absolutely certain is how is to be done without Herbert's knowledge or suspicion. He'll be no more aware of his benefactor than you yourself are. He's off to make a marriage proposal by this. Good night, Mr. Pip. Who are you? Hush. I was sentenced for life, do you understand? It's death to come back. If found I am sure to be hanged, do you understand? I understand. I understand your desperation. Pip... you don't understand what I risked for you. - Eh? - Me? Me? What are you to me? You're the child who acted noble to me... and I have never forgot it, Pip. You? Abel Magwitch. Convict then. And since... a sheep-farmer... stock-breeder who came to wonderful wealth, Pip. Look, I'm glad you have recovered yourself but... I cannot renew that chance intercourse for our ways are different ways now. Oh, no, they're not! - I asked Wemmick for your address. - You know Wemmick? I instruct his master. Jaggers. You have been chosen to... subside to some property. Are you not? May I ask whose property? - I don't know. - I do. Look at your fine linen. And the ring set round with rubies. That's a gentleman's. Yes, Pip... dear boy. It's me who's done this. I made a gentleman on you. There wasn't no one else? Who else should there be? - It should be... - I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea should go to you. I swore since, sure as I ever speculated and got rich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth. And you do! And my pleasure to see you do it. Best of all, Pip! Best of any one of them! From the judge in his wig to the colonist of the dust. I'll show them a better gentleman than all of them put together. No! I looked forward so distant, Pip. From so far. Herbert, I think. Take it in right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot if you speak in any way or soever.. - Kiss it. - Do Herbert as he wishes it. Now you're on oath you know, Pip's comrade. Have I the pleasure of meeting Mr. Joe Gargery then? You are not as Pip describes you. I'm not in the business of fashioning old shoes. I make gentlemen, don't I, Pip? I own one brought up in London, gentlemen. Pip? When I was a boy Mr. Magwitch found himself caught in the manacle. Now I find it made him rose into my flesh. If I never take another penny from him, think how much I owe him already. And you intend to take no further benefits from him? - Oh, how can I? - But your debts, Pip? If I choose to renounce my patron that is a matter of me, Herbert. Why do you seek to give me this advice? I seek to give you this advice as a friend. You may look and him and feel quite unable to accept any expenses he comes to lavish you with, but think how he may react to that. - What do you mean? - Well... think of this. He comes here at the risk of his own life, for the realization of his fixed idea... yourself. In the moment of this realization, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from under his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him. And that kind of disappointment do you see nothing that he might do. My reputation is ruined if I accept his money and ruined if I don't. That's his power of you. But only as long as he remains in England. But how I am supposed to get him out of the country? If you want to induce him to go you will have to go with him. Go where? Go for a soldier in east of India? Don't be absurd. Wherever I go with him I can't prevent his coming back. The danger of his recklessness is here and now and Newgate is the next street. The first thing you must do is to get him out of here. - Find a lodging house for him. - Yes. And as for the rest, you are right. I have to extricate myself. Extricate myself from him. I'm going back to Kent tonight. Some business there with Miss Havisham. You will be back to tend your business here? Oh, yes. Clara. A new tenant for your house. Miss. You best not loiter, Abel. We will blast them all one day, eh, Pip? We will blast them all, eh? Pip's gentleman. Pip, this is my dear girl Clara. Now I see why have you looked so favourably to the future. I think it was with some excitement too. Herbert, I have to leave to Kent. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. What wind blows you here? When I set off from the coach I had one purpose only. And now I find I have other business too. Well, speak. These past few years it seems I have been harbouring a delusion. More than one, in fact. And you encouraged them. Fueled them. - You let me go on. - Yes. I let you go on. Was that kind? Who am I for god's sake that I should be kind? I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery, and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune, anything. But I think I have since made the worst discovery. I've just seen Drummle. I'm going to marry him. Why not tell me? And not inform me? You ingrate! I plan to presently. It is the reason for this visit but it is my own act and that is something long overdue. You cold cold heart. Do you reproach me for being cold? I learned your lessons. I am what you have made me. So proud. Who taught me to be proud? Who told me that the daylight would blind me that I should not go near to now? Cannot! I have never been unfaithful to you all your schooling. I have never shown any weakness that I can charge myself with. It would be weakness to return respect? To return love? Love? Estella? You know I love you. You cannot give yourself away to that mean and stupid brute. I shall do well enough. So shall my husband. You're supposed to marry for love, Estella. Not as an act of will. Mr. Drummle knows I take nothing to the marriage. He does not mind it. He will not feel it. And so that's you choose him? Who should I go to Pip? The man who would expect marriage to me to be a blessing. Who would expect feeling, who would expect love? And so the man who loves you is to be rejected by you. Man who loves me will no longer be disappointed by me, tormented by me. - I will always be tormented by you. - Nonsense. It will pass in a week. - To the last hour of my life! - No, I cannot comprehend it. I cannot comprehend. I have a heart to be stabbed in a shooting, Pip. Nothing more. I did try to warn you of this. Can I help you there, Joe? Pip. Pip standing large as life in the forge door? Why? This is astonishing, old chap! - Oh, how are you, Joe? - Well, I'm astonished. What brings you here? I had business at Satis House. You could send me a word, Pip, for I am a reader now, thanks to Biddy. I wasn't expected. In fact, it's been difficult to make any plans lately, Joe. Come, Joe. Let's beat it out. No, Pip. I don't think that'll be fit now. Do you? Not any more, old chap. Sir? Sir? The messanger of this said you would be most kind if you read it by my lantern. Mr. Pip, don't go home. You have my note? Never leave documentary evidence if you can help it. Now... The disappearance of a certain person from the colonies has provoked some conjecture amongst the fraternity of which he was a member. And your chambers are being watched. Who by? - You have somewhere to go tonight? - Yes. Then I advise you not to break cover from it during daylight. Confine all movements to the darkness. Now it is my turn to shun the daylight. - I beg your pardon? - It's nothing. Go for foreign air, Mr. Pip, but await the things slacken. I hope he's not caught... for your sake. For if convicted, all his possessions will be forfeited to the Crown and you... - No longer a gentleman. - There is the danger unless you avail yourself of all this portable property now. Miss Skiffins has come to visit. I hope he's not caught. The fortunes of two people should be bound together for the good. Eh, Mr. Pip? Why should I fly off like a bird that took flight? If the danger would be 50 times greater I shall still have come to you. But you know your capture would mean death. Death by the rope, you said. I can disguise myself. - Oh, Lord... - All these things can be bought. A powder... spectacles... black clothes. - It will not work. - It will not work... because you do not want it to work. - You just want me gone. - I shall go with you. And leave me somewhere. I've been left before. I've been tricked before. You remember my enemy, Compeyson, out on the marshes? I stood alongside him in the dock I watched how the looked on me and light on him because he was a gentleman. So you don't go telling me you'll go along with me! I am trying to help you. I am in this with you. Unluckily! Compeyson was involved with me. Till he used lies to divide himself from me. And left me guilty. - I am not your fellow convict. - No. You're more to me than any son. I said that to you as someone... who lost a child once. And I should like you to think of me as your second father. Abel... My chambers are being watched. You have enemies in London. - Who told you this? - Wemmick. He knows. - Is it Compeyson? - I don't know. But you must rely on Wemmick's judgment. And I must rely on your good faith. You know he is in great danger. I cautioned him that presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony. And that he would be hanged? That it would render him liable to the extreme penalty of the law. - Do you have any advice to impart on the planning of his escape? I wish to hear no more of that. My chambers are being watched. If he was caught... I am not responsible for that. What's your responsibility towards your client? You are after all his agent. You will kindly inform him there is still a balance outstanding. So, Pip. Our friend Drummle has played his cards. Yes. Estella has now married him. And was on honeymoon in Paris. Molly, Molly, how slow you are today. So. Here is to Mrs. Bentley Drummle. I'm... very sorry, master. I'll go... See to it afterwards. Go. Well, let's try the toast again, shall we? Mr. Jaggers, I'm afraid I will have to take my leave of you early. Thank you for your hospitality. Oh, what a man he is! I find it's best to screw yourself up when dining with him. Now I'm very screwed up. Wemmick, you remember you called this housekeeper a wild beast tamed... - I did. - How did Mr. Jaggers tamed her? It's his business. You ask me my Walworth capacity? Of course. Twenty or more years ago she was tried at the Old Bailey for murder and acquitted. Jaggers was for her. - Who was murdered? - Another woman. Strangled. - You have seen those wrists. - Jaggers made a spectacle of them. The housekeeper who was married over the broomstick to a tramping man. She was said a perfect fury in point of jealousy, so jealous she gave up a young child after acquittal to revenge herself upon unfaithful husband. - The child adopted by whom? - I don't know of it, Mr. Pip. Anyway, Jaggers was not too many for the jury raised a technicality and they gave in. - You know the sex of the child? - Said it's been a girl. I'm afraid Mrs Drummle does not wish to receive visitors at this moment. - But you told her my name? - Yes, sir. Is it real? Do you feel the heat of this flame, Miss Havisham? Then it is real. Whose child was Estella? You don't know or you don't want to say? I know her mother. I know the story of her mother. Her name is Molly and she is Jaggers' housekeeper. He brought the child of her broken marriage here to you. Why? I told him I wanted a little girl to rear in love. And he was charged with arranging it. And Jaggers saving her from the life of what? Punishment? Neglect? Crime? And for the want of nourishment? No longer to be deprived and be devil? So he brings her to a place more blighted than she could never grown up naturally. I meant to save her from misery like my own. But instead she was taught it. I'm sorry. - Look what I've done to you. - An apology may be enough for me. To compare to Estella, I am easily recompensed. Yes. Yes. Mr. Jaggers informs me that you are someone of a benefactor to Herbert Pocket, but are unable to complete the services. He freely told you my business? I wished to know it. Why? How much is required to complete the service? 900 pounds. This is my imperative for you to receive that money. And to yourself... Who I am for God's sake that I should be kind? Your words to me on the delusions I have been harbouring all these years. And now your own have come to pass. Do you know how Estella feels? She's in Mayfair. You are a stranger now, but I have seen her lately. And I can report to you that she is used most cruelly by Mr. Bentley Drummle. That she breaks no men's hearts, only her own. That she reeks no revenge on men, but is herself the subject of her own husband's disrespect and cowardice as you were, Miss Havisham. As you were. No. It can't be true. The lessons went wrong, Miss Havisham. She feels nothing as you wished. Except she also feels nothing for herself. The creature you hoped to nurture is gone and lost to you. The woman who now so resembles you is also lost to you. You have nothing. What... would you have me do? Pip? Pip? Help me! Help me! Estella! What do you want? I only want to ask after Miss Havisham. One of her servants gave it out she was burned all over. - She is lucky to survive. - I heard you played your part anyways. - You're in my way. - And you are always in my way. Ever since you was a child. But you goes out of my way this present day. I know no more of you. You're dead. - What have I done to you? - Everything. You cost me my place in the house. - I could let you stay there. - You cost me my living. - And now it would be enough, without more. - What more? You come between me and the woman I liked. - Biddy? - You gave Orlick a bad name to her. You gave it to yourself. You did yourself harm. No! How dare you? At the forge it was Orlick who was bullied while you was favoured. And when I complained then I was paid off there. And you went up town to see your Miss Havisham. Still, I came back. - Oh, I came back, allright? - You killed my sister. Your doing. You did for her. And now you're a gentleman and I can barely earn a living. I am as wretched and hopeless as you would never be. You're a liar. This is some... pleading. - But Orlick won't listen to it. - My benefactor is a convict. A convict to die hard from the rope. So I have a fortune which can never enrich me. The woman I love is married to someone else and I have no idea what is to become of me. I'm already done for, Orlick. I've nothing left except my life. And so I would gladly let you take it. Take it. You... enemy! Will you let me go? You could show mercy to me. Aye. As to a poor beast. You pray well to drive me out of this country Now you are to be out though. You're not to be favoured any more! You are my equal now and I am yours, except that I am more than yours because I let you go. Yes. I am higher than you now, young villain. I am higher than you! I don't know why I did not see the likeness before between Estella and her mother Molly, your housekeeper. So you think you know some of Estella's history, Pip? I think I know it all. I know her father too. Magwitch makes no claim here. He has absolutely no knowledge of her existence. But I know Molly harboured enough jealousy to kill another woman for him and enough malice to deprive him of his daughter too. I should remind you we still attend Miss Havisham's funeral. Miss Havisham who had a fancy to bring up a child, then engage to your services. Miss Havisham to whom you sent Estella to be saved once you deprived her of her natural mother. Molly was facing the gallows. If you saw the children I see daily... If you saw what happened to them... - I saw what happened to Estella. - And whom are you certain to reveal the secret? Estella is now married for money. Do you wish to drag her back to disgrace after an escape of 20 years? She is married to Drummle. I hardly call that a redemption, her saving. We used to share those confidences, Pip. - Which? - When you were troubled or unhappy. Am I now? You know Miss Havisham was not my patron, Biddy. I have heard it. I cannot tell you the rest. Not yet. I forgive you. Drummle did not accompany you today? Mr. Drummle is with his horse today riding hard in the country. He treats you well, I hope. He whips his horse. I'm spared in comparison. - Estella... - No, it's of no matter, Pip. Only warm-blooded creatures feel pain. Estella, I found I'm more attached to you than I could ever imagined. Must wish me good fortune. Where is he? A few weeks ago you could not stand aside, Pip. Now you cannot wait for him. The day after tomorrow there are two steamers coming off London. One for Hamburg, one for Rotterdam. We raw out, hail the first and do not get on board until we have a chance. - We? - I'm coming with you. - Dear boy. - There's nothing to keep me in London. I have no idea what is to follow our going. I have no idea what is to become of us. Then stick by me, dear boy. I'm used to such. Abel... You look like the uncertain prince of Denmark. Thank you, dear boy. - You want to know what it means? - No, no. Main thing is the foreign language. You read me a foreign language, dear boy. Abel. You spoke of having a child once. Mind if I ask you the particulars? A daughter. Her mother took her away. Gave her up for adoption. I've never seen her since. I never shall. I do wonder what have become of her. I do wonder everyday. - You cold? - I've been colder. What was that? It's a boat yonder. We're being followed. Pull in there. Hurry. That looks a comfortable home. It looks like they're customs officers. Look. There's no thought of us. You're shivering, dear boy. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Pip. - Goodbye, Herbert. Good luck. - You ready? - Trust me, dear boy. Pip. You have to return the fugitive back. His name is Abel Magwitch. I apprehend that man. I call upon him to surrender and you two with him. Compeyson. Take him down with me. Abel! Pip! But in a fatal moment, you clinged to those propensities and passions the holds of which so long rendered him a scourge to society. He has left his heaven of rest and repentance and come back to the country where he was proscribed. The appointed punishment for his return to the land which had cast him out being death. He came here for my sake! His case being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to die. He came here for my sake! - Have you thought about what you are to do? - No. In this branch-house of our, Pip, we must have a... a... - A clerk? - A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand into a partner as I have. Perhaps you can leave the question open for a while. Of course. Of course there are other priorities first to look up to. - Remember me to him. - I shall. I hope you'll find Cairo agreeable. - I cannot put this off, Pip. - Nor should you. Now go. You will look after Clara while I have gone off? When I come back she and I will walk quietly to the nearest church. - How is he? - Less and less. - He's removed now to the infirmary. - So bad job. And I assure you I mean to cut off for long time the sacrifice of so much portable property! - Dear me! - And the owner of such property? I know you are rather out of sorts, Mr. Pip, but I hope you will remember the match for the walk we agreed upon today. You can still manage it, I hope. It will surely occupy you an hour or so. I have taken a holiday today. I have not done such a thing in last 12 months. Halloa! Here's a church. Let's go in. Halloa! It's some gloves. Let's put them on. Halloa! Here's Miss Skiffins. Let's have a wedding. Halloa! Here's a ring. Westminster Abbey was the scene, Abel. My very good friend and one or two baronets were the best men. Gentlemen of the congregation including me, all dressed alike. Black dress coat, silk white necktie. These white gloves which I bring you as a keepsake. I always knew you could be a gentleman. Without me. I... I occupied one of the front pews, Abel. And after the ecclesiastical splendor and court service, we were entertained to a wonderful breakfast and a military band. And the wedding cake was nine feet high and a foot deep. And such presents were displayed! Rugs from Persia, the finest gold clocks. Exquisite jewellery. Are you in great pain? I don't complain, but... Would you let me give you something of what it means? So he found his father alone in a terraced vineyard, taking about the plant. He was clothed in filthy doublet, patched and obscene. Now, when Odiseus saw his father thus wasted with age and in great grief of heart, he stood still beneath a tall pear tree and let fall a tear. He had returned to his own country, Abel. You are my father now And I love you. - He barely breathes now. - Then you may not go yet. His daughter is a Lady, you know. She is married to an heir but one to a baronet. I know her very well. He did not know her at all. - Are you real? - Well, we come from the door. - What do you want? I don't know you. - Well, sir. This is a matter you'll soon arrange on doing, sir. You're arrested. - What is the debt? - L123,156. A tailor's account, I think. - What is to be done? - You better come to my house. I keep a very nice house. Let see your face. Up. This is where I've got to, Joe. The news reported me before the letter. I said to Biddy that you might be... amongst strangers. They are not so strange, Joe. The police words were: "go to him without manage a loss of time" Your receipt. The debt of the costs. You paid them all. I have saved, Pip. And it was better spared on you than anyone. Start to wipe your slates, please, everybody. That's it. I know you've just done that. That's all for today. Thank you very much. You may now leave. Quietly on the way out. See you tomorrow. I have tried to talk to Joe about my true benefactor. - He tells me not to pass... - Unnecessary subjects. I thought it might be you who advised him. I considered it might be painful to you. Always such tact. And sweet kindness. What should you do now? Try some different occupation hereabouts. - Or go to Cairo. - Such a distant place. - An opportunity awaits for me there. - But you cannot decide? It all rests with you, Biddy. Until I know your answer. I think you wants like me very well. And even when my heart strayed away from you, it was quieter and better with you than it has ever been since. Pip. And if you could like me only half as well once more, if you could take me with all the disappointments on my head, I should hope I am a little worthier of you now than I was. So please, Biddy. Tell me if you will go through the world with me. Make it a better world for me as I would try to make it a better world for you. Joe. They shall be very well. While I advised him not to speak of some subjects to you I hoped he would speak to you of this one. Our wedding day. Biddy has agreed to marry me. Astonishing, eh? It's to be a simple ceremony. Joe had been saving for it but there were more urgent expenses to be attended to. You shall make each other as happy as you deserve to be. You are the best people in the world. Now, then... I'm Pip. Come to play. What do you want? To look around the place and then perhaps raze it to the ground. Save it exactly the trouble of pulling it down. This house is lived in. Miss Havisham left the house to me. And thus I'm now separated from Mr Drummle... - You came home. - There. That's done. A letter to Mr. Jaggers in the matter of my separation. - He advises you? - There is the benefit of continuity. You wish continuity? You see, I have made many changes in the way of decoration, Pip. You know I must look for a trade now. I have heard it. I have no idea how I shall go on in the world. And you, Estella? - Oh, I shall do well enough. - Alone? Here? Still mindful of her lessons? Or is the greater difference between your face that you received and maintenent payments for the man who used you so cruelly? And shall the Pockets visit you on your birthday? And shall a boy from the village be sent to entertain you and divert you from your solitude? Tell me you are as happy as I had been, Estella. Tell me that Drummle made you suffer and you are suffering still. Tell me. Now you know what my heart has been. No... No. We cannot do this. No. I should go. Go where? Do we have to part again simply because we cannot... act on our love for each other? Do we have to be deprived of our company too? Now, is there a knave or a jack? For I wish not to be laughed at. Call it what you will. Oh, I shall. When you visit me next you should send word if you intend to come. Otherwise I may be out. Or simply too busy. It's impossible to say when I shall next be here. I have to work for a living.
