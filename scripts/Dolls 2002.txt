None other than I I, Umekawa... I am to blame for all. Should I be grateful? Or should I lament? I don't know Read my heart Bowed in touching distress She cried anguished tears Onto the pieces of gold The coins soon resembled Beautiful and bright kerria flowers All covered with dew Bathed in her tears The coins sparkled brilliantly Honor, glory and fortune Are only fleeting grains of sand Their traces become dust Scattered on the roads to Yamato To be forever trampled on They're the bound beggars. Bound beggars! - Hey! - Hi. Tell me, Sawako, isn't she Matsumoto's bride? Not anymore. When I got his invitation, I thought they finally tied the knot. But I was wrong. He's marrying the daughter of our company's president. You're kidding! The family has taken a liking to him. So, he's a Cinderella boy? He's out of our league now! But how did he deal with Sawako? He must have made a clean break. I never thought Matsumoto was the type! Any guy would take that opportunity. Probably. It's a shortcut to success. In two years time, we'll be bowing down to him. It's the president's request! I'm already engaged. Forget her. You haven't married her yet. This is about your life. Your father is right. He's a hard worker. But it was harder on him without a diploma. Why do you think he sent you to college? Think carefully. This is about your life. It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Don't let it go by. I could never leave her. If it's too difficult, we'll apologize. We'll beg her, do whatever it takes. What is it? Congratulations. I'm so happy! Excuse me. Someone is here to see you. A friend of Miss Sawako. Hey! What's going on? An old friend of mine is here. I had forgotten to invite him. Choosing success was so important? Sawako chose suicide. Is she dead? No, she survived. But she's lost her mind. She doesn't even recognize me. She's as good as dead. Where is she? Hospital. Which one? She won't recognize you either. Sawako chose suicide. She won't recognize you either. It's delicious. Drink some more. What happened to him? He just disappeared. And the wedding? Looks like it's cancelled. Okay! We pick up the trash. Then we put it in here. There's still some over there. That's it. How...? Leaving your own wedding! What were you thinking? The bride was in tears. And the president was furious. Could you lend me some money? Now, that's... Whatever you have on you. What do you plan to do? If you don't apologize soon, you'll be ruined. You're a real friend. I'll call you soon. Hey! Matsumoto! Sir... Your lady friend... Don't leave the room on your own. You'll just get into trouble. I'll take care of everything. I'm sorry. Give me that. Sorry. But Sawako, she... I know. It seems she's not well at all. Is that true? Are you there? Hello? Matsumoto? Hey, you! Are you from around here? Where do you live? Excuse me. Is something wrong? - Do you know her? - Yes. Then you should pay for them. Give them to me. Do you want to play? Go ahead. Open them. Let me... Like this. Let me... You have to blow. Like this. It's chilly. Come inside. You'll catch a cold. Watch out, you idiots! Are you crazy? I'll buy you a new one. Forgive me. All done. Everything's loaded. Good. Thank you. Thank you for everything. We'll be going now. We'll be going now. It was his choice. Boss... Your new bodyguard. I'm Ikeuchi. At your service. Is your mother well? That's good. Thank you. - Say hello to your mother. - Okay. He's a son of a "brother". What's up with them? They're weird! Excuse me, sir. So, where did you originally come from? Hiroshima. The Takigawa clan. Oh, yeah. How long have you been with us? For two years. Already? Why did you become a yakuza? When I was a kid, I was always fighting. - A real troublemaker. - Idiot! What has fighting done for you? Better to use your head! Yes, sir. In the old days, it's true, we'd get what we wanted by force. Stay away from us after you've killed him. Even between "brothers", we have to kill each other sometimes. After you. Brother! You're killing me, too? Sorry about that. Do it. What a pity. We were really close. The doctor is here. I can't tell if I'm better or worse. That damn quack! He never speaks straight. But I think... I probably don't have long to go. - Are you single? - Yes. No woman? I left her. Why? A woman can be a burden. Gets in the way. You're from the old school. Am I? I thought like you back then. - Here I am. - You surprised me! I brought lunch for you. That's great! Promise to eat it all? - Here. - Thanks. - I'll start. - Sure. Is it good? - Delicious. - I'm glad! I'm going out. Take me to Saitama. Today is Saturday, right? They're from the store. - Should you do that? - It's okay. They're leftovers. Next Saturday, I'll make them myself. Next Saturday... I may not be able to come. - Will you be busy? - No. Yes. Well... I'm thinking of quitting my job. The factory isn't doing well. It may go bankrupt. It's better to leave before. The owner is too nice. He doesn't have the heart... He can't tell me I have to go. I see. You know, I'll find a much better job. If I stay like this, I could never make you happy. I don't know which way to go. I need time alone to see things clearly. Don't worry about me. Go on with your life. I'll come for you when things are better. And not in these old clothes! I'll come all dressed up! You'll be surprised at my success. Well, I should be going. Goodbye. Hiro! I'll wait for you! I'll bring lunch for you! I'll wait here every Saturday! I'll wait for you! I'll bring lunch for you! I'll wait here every Saturday! I'll wait for you! Wait here for me. What is this place? Don't ask questions like that. Sorry. That's the famous woman, you know. Every Saturday she brings two lunches and sits on that bench. She waits for her long-lost lover. Excuse me, could we sit here? I'm sorry, but I'm waiting for my boyfriend. We have a date to have lunch together. Could you leave the space free for him? Sorry about that. Listen, we're not getting any bites. Sorry. Why aren't the fish biting here? Sorry. Enough with the sorry! Did you put bait on my line? What did you put? - A slice of tangerine. - Tangerine! You used tangerine? For bait? You can't catch fish with tangerine! Idiot! This is useless. Let's go. Come on! Hey! It flew away. Got you! A lot of fans come here. Famous Mr. Aoki came to see her. Famous Mr. Aoki came to see her.

About four years. Like the kid in red. They're not really kids. They're both adults. - In any case, they're loyal. - Yes. But be careful. They can be just as dangerous.
