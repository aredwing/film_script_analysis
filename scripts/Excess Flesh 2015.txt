Anything else, or is this... a wasted day? Isn't it divine? It's Prada. Isn't it divine? It's Prada! Isn't it divine? It's Prada! Nina gave it to me, just for being super cool, plus it didn't fit any of the models. Oh my God, it's fucking hot in here. - Smells like ass. - I'm cold. Make-up. Effortless chic. Come on, please? Please, you're so good at it! - No. - Come on. Get up, get up, get up. - Oh. - Come on, do my face. I don't know how you work in the fashion industry. They totally objectify women. Says the fat girl. I'm not fat. Actually, you're not. You're just not toned. You just need to do some Pilates. Some leg lifts. Yeah. Cuz I never eat. I don't know how you do that. Come out with me tonight. No. Rob will be there. So? What the fuck is wrong with you? - You know I, it's... - He's nice, and he likes you. - You would know. - Yeah, I would. He did nothing but talk about you the other night. Yeah, that's not all he did. Ouch! Bitch! Nothing happened but a little rubbing. He came and then we passed out. Admit it, he makes your pussy wet. Mm-hmm. He does, yeah he do. Oh come on, admit it, you like him. All right, yeah I do. A little... Just stay away. You're not down for my sloppy seconds? Oh girl, come on, I'm just joking. Okay, the other night I was fucked up, I wasn't thinking. You know how I get. Yeah, I do. I promise, I'll keep my hands off. Pinky swear. Pinky swear. Oh, come out with me tonight. No, you stay in with me. Huh? We'll make popcorn and we'll watch A Time to Kill. Girl, you know Matthew McConaughey makes me splash. - Brownies? - Stop it. - Ice cream? - Jill. Cold sweet pink wine. Barbecue potato chips. Cool Whip. Gummy Bears, french fries. - Chili. - Sour cream. - And butter. - And mayonnaise. - Pop tarts. - With chili... and sour cream, and butter, and mayonnaise. Oh. Come stay here with me. God. Don't be such a boring bitch! - Come out with me. - I can't. Fine. Just do my face. Lifestyle and attitudes... The beautiful, the bored, the broken. They are my muses. Dinner is served, bitches. It's bouillon. It's all they eat in. Hey, you know what? I do not need... Right? But she looked amazing. Amazing! No. I heard that this is all she eats. Oh, please. It's cut, cut, snip, snip. Ga, Ga, right? Whatev. I applaud her effort. Self control. The discipline. Oh come on, she still has work to do. There are olives in this drink. You saw me eat the bouillon. Are you trying to sabotage me Adriana? You are so good at this. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah? Too much to drink or did you try some of the bouillon? I don't know what that is. I think it's soup. I think it's soup. I'm not really good at networking. Well, everyone here seems to be pretty preoccupied. So, good job. It's like, have you ever seen that, uh, Last Year at Marienbad? What's that? It's a movie, black and white. Um, yes... No, no. Tell me. I don't watch a lot of movies. Never mind. Me too. I don't either. So anyway, are you gonna tell me? You gonna... Please? Um... Everyone talks in... riddles. Cuz they're not real, they're just like fragments, like symbols, or like fragments of memories. Or what, I don't even know. It's totally post modern. Whoa. What? Uh... You coming back to the party? Oh shit, shit. What? I said your name's Jill, right? It's your party? No, it's not. No. Not really. I just insulted your friends. Nope. They're Jennifer's friends. Yeah. I only met one cute girl here tonight. Listen, nothing Jennifer says about me is true. You should look for her. What, what, what did you say? You should look for her! I am. Have you seen her? Nobody in here but me. I know. So are you coming back to the party? Come on let yourself go. Hey, I hope it wasn't something I said. No, no, it wasn't you. Are you okay? All right. I guess we're done talking for now. I think that's a good idea. Well, when you're done in there, you come find me. Or I'll come find you. Feel better. No, no no. Come on. Oh God... Hey. I was gonna get a rag to clean that up, but I... I passed out. I'm sorry. Oh. All right. Is that my T shirt? Uh, are you okay? If I could... Don't touch me. Don't! I'm sorry. You know stop, don't apologize. Why are you apologizing? I won't apologize again. All right. I just though we might've had a connection last night. What did you do? Okay, that's lame. I'm sorry. Oh. Can I have my t-shirt back? No, keep it. A connection. You connected with pussy. What has happened to you? Wait! I just want to talk to you, just for a second. It's about the complex's party policy. You're just going to ignore me? This is super childish. This is not the way for adults or neighbors to behave. I know you're in there. Where are you? Well, you know where you're gonna be in 1.5 hours? You're gonna be here in my pussy. Who was that on the phone? Steven, of course. It's Steven kind of week. What? Don't you remember? Fashion waits for no one. Why didn't you tell me we're having a party? Oh, honey. Did you have fun, right? You know, I think that guy Rob, is totally into you. I think it was perfect. Until the cops showed up. Whatever. You know, we both live here. Oh my God, not you too. I already had to dodge that nosy old Cathy. "I just want to talk about the complex's party policy." It's not complicated. I had a party and you weren't invited. Noise complaints? She's a ruiner of fun. She's not that bad. She's actually kind of nice. She's like talking to a basket of rolls. And she doesn't get a say about what goes on in my house. Neither do you until you, like, get a job. - I'm trying. - No you're not. You're lying around in your fat and your filth. Don't be like... Constructive, motivational? Destructive and cruel, you know, like... I know. You won't let me forget it. But you've been here for nine months already. So have you. Not paying rent, I'd like to add. Oh, you're such a good friend. Don't kiss my ass, bitch. It was sarcasm. Anyway, you're suppose to be helping me. Oh, here we go. Blah, blah, blah. It's so hard, blah, blah. This town is wide open, so stop your whining, strap on a six-shooter, and get to fucking work. It's easy for you to say. Yeah, and easy to do, but you have to leave the fucking house. Jill, I am your friend. I... I'm harsh with you because I respect you enough to not bullshit the true. I'm having a hard time. I don't wanna talk about this anymore. This weekend... This weekend we'll sit down and we'll figure everything out. Make a total plan for your life, even give a bitch a makeover. It's always this weekend. No more, not tonight, Jill. I just want to watch some TV, finish my dinner, and wait for Steven. Trying to get my own hard time. Wants some? You're a b... You're a bitch. You know that? I know. Right. I don't know I, I just, I can do better. You know. Is that a question? Right, like I know I'm good, but what if I felt good too? I understand. Is that water? We're okay, just, I don't know. You know what I'm saying? I don't. Do you know what a suppository is? What's that? Depository, like a bank? Suppository. This gets inserted into your anus. Oh, you're looking at me. On camera I do that? This is a test. This station is conducting a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test. Okay, guys, at the premier of his new movie, a fan thrust a baby into Zac Effron's face. Check it out. Wow - That's crazy Aren't they handsome? Well its got a big head. Wait, wait, no. I think she wants him to... See you, babe. Hi. Why are you up so late? Mom, it's afternoon. Oh. I just had the most horrible dream about you, darling. It's a sign. I think you need to come home. Fine. You look washed out. You shouldn't wear that color. Oh my God, oh my God. Someone's in the house! Listen! Listen! They're coming! They're coming! Mommy loves you so much. So much. Mom. It's Daddy. Daddy's home. I see him. You wanna come say hello? Daddy doesn't, he doesn't wanna be on camera. He's shy. But he's home! Daddy's home! Yay! Why are you home? What, what, why are you home? I didn't call you. I what, I don't, wait, whats wrong? Stop messing with my hair, I fixed it! Oh, I did call you, you need, you need to convince our daughter to come home. Jackson, it's vital. It's vital. She's in trouble. No. I don't wanna go to bed now. I don't wanna go to bed. I don't wanna go to bed. No, stop it. No! I know you hate it when I apologize. So I present you with this. I regret the collateral damage. Shit, you're mad. I'm making lunch, do you want some? This is whoa. Mm-hm. This is whoa. You're not gonna have any? That's all you're having? Um, no, I don't like to cook and eat. Well, let's go out! Have somebody else cook, this town is great for food. So those kids on your Facebook page, they're not yours. Fuck no. I mean, I didn't mean it that way. I meant it like... It's just complicated, all right? I work for the CFSD. I worked for the CFSD. I'm confused. California Children and Family Service Division. Well, just so you know you can see everything on your Facebook page. So... - I'm the worst at social media. - Yeah. Someone told me that I actually have to do something with that stuff. The privacy settings? Is that how we know each other? From Facebook? Friend of a friend? Is it bad that I knew nothing about that at all? Mm, no. I just mean you have to be careful. About? Being too open. Really? I always thought that was a good thing. I don't know. Did I say something wrong? What are you talking about? Shit. I said too much, yeah? I'm such a douchebag. All right, I feel like a douche. - No. - My lunch is about over, so. Did you wanna take some food home, at least? - I'd love that. - Okay. You know I like you, right? I mean not like in a hook up kind of way. I like you. That was nice, right? I don't know. Thanks for the meal. We're gonna go out, right? Okay. All right, back to the real world. Whatever that means. Man, that's corny. Uh, yeah... I'm lame. I warned you about that. I'm just... gonna clean up. Go do that. Fuck! Creepy bitch. What? Oh. You're mad. Don't be mad. There's nothing wrong with a little... I'm starving. You promised. You were never fuck him or his pretty dick. I couldn't let that go to waste. But you promised. Oh my fucking God, are these short ribs? You promised. Oh, honey, look. I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me. I can't control myself. I'm exhausted. It's probably why I'm being such a crazy mega bitch. I'm sorry for it all. Tomorrow, look, tomorrow I promise, we'll sit down and talk everything out. Everything? Everything. We'll have a nice meal and I'll get a good bottle of wine. And you can cook. - Tomorrow. - Prom, tomorrow. I'm gonna crash. Goodnight. Dear Neighbor, I was so happy when you moved in. I imagined shared morning coffees and borrowing sugar. I at least hoped, that if we couldn't be friends, we could be courteous neighbors, but that has all changed. You have changed, and it concerns me, and not just because I live next door. The party was an obvious cry for help. I mean, no offense, but choose better friends. I don't want to have to call someone. That's not the kind of friend and neighbor I would want, so that's not the kind I'm going to be. I mean, I know, you're having a hard time. I just wanted to send a little gift and let you know we're thinking about you. If you ever want to talk, I am totally here for you. Push the button. Call me. It's a cinch. What up, Jilly Jill? Damn. Romantic. Where have you been? What the duck? Oh, God. That tastes like ass. It's not fair what you're doing to me. We were gonna talk. I need to talk. I've been so patient. Patient? Don't you go talking to me ever again about patience. Patience is one of the seven deadly sins of not having a fucking life. You'll never beat me. Jill? Jill. The fuck?! What the fuck, Jill? What the fuck? We need to talk. Told you. You're not gonna get away with this, you know. Psycho bitch. Oh! Let's talk. Okay, what do you want to talk about? Don't tempt me. We'll figure it all out. Don't patronize me, Serio. Don't you dare. Oh. Please stop. I will help you. Mm, still moist. That's just cruel. Hmm. Oh. Oh. La la-la la. Such a perfect wedding. You've really crossed the line. What happened? Don't go any farther. You don't want any? It's okay, it's more for me. God, it's so good. You do everything good. How could you fuck up your marriage? I never wanted to believe all that stuff Trevor said about you. Don't you say his name! The frigidity, the slovenliness, the disorder. That's not you. It's not the Jennifer I know. Why are you doing this? You know why. I will help you. Mm-mm, it's too late. Trevor always said you were selfish and then now I see that all he said was true. He broke me. You seem fine to me. Nothing I ever did was right. Crawl to me, bitch. Should got knee pads. I did, but it wasn't enough. Try harder. Try harder. Try harder. Try harder. My skirts were too long. My necklines were too high. What? Try harder. The underwear. Come on, come on, you wouldn't swallow. Why won't you say that? You wouldn't even go near it. You should see you now. He was rough. He said I was flabby, I disgusted him. Maybe, maybe you could get him back. He was cruel. Oh, he was constructive and motivational. I mean, you should take his advice. Seriously, reinvent yourself, become the cu... Slutty cum-guzzler Trevor always wanted you to be. It can't be that bad, you just got to be particular about what you feed him, right? Yeah, you could do your research. You're good at that, remember? Really good. Seriously, you could save your marriage, Jennifer. I don't want him back. So you don't want a piece of cake? I want you to let me go. Well, now we know what it's like to want something from someone and not get it. Frothy and nasty. Aah! Help, help me! Somebody help! Help. Help me! Help! Help! - Help! - Stop it. Stop your screeching. I've heard it every night for months and so has everyone else. Oh, wow. That was easy. Or were you faking it? You don't have to convince me of anything, honey. Okay, where were we, let's see. Problem areas, problem areas. Arms up, please. Up! Please. Just remember, everyone can hear you. And by the way... no one cares. Is anybody in here? Hello, it's Rob. Look, if you're in there... I'm just trying to figure out what went wrong, that's all. I've been calling... a lot. And I have your Tupperware, so... Oh shit. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay, it's not, it's not your fault. Have you see her at all? - No. - No? No, I think she's at work. Oh. Oh. Did you hear that? Fucking cinch. What? What's so funny. Nothing. Nothing... What? - It's just- - Huh? What is it you're saying? Nothing. Are you saying I'm... Are you saying I'm fat? I'm a fat pig? Huh? Like, I just can't control myself? Is that what you're saying? I'm happy. Happy? Show me happy. Show me. Stop crying, stop it, stop. It's not that bad. It's not. Jennifer st... Oh my God, Jennifer, stop. Not tonight. Would you please? I just wanna watch TV. Maybe eat my dinner, and wait for Steven. Here. Stop crying. - Another one? - Yes. - Another? - Yes. Really? Really that is so fucking rude. What? I'm sharing with you. You're not gonna share with me? Huh? That's the way we do it, right? Right? Isn't that how we do it? I don't understand. What? You don't? I don't understand? Ugh! Of course you don't fucking understand! Because you're too fucking selfish! You're too selfish, Jennifer. You want them all, you can fucking have them all! Fucking have them! We can't let any of them go to waste, okay? None of 'em go to waste. Eat 'em fucking all right now. Eat 'em, please. Going to rehab. It's the middle of the night, mother. Oh. I had another dream about you. And you... were... perfect! I know you will do whatever it takes to get your life back on track. Mommy will call you from rehab. Okay. Work harder! Work harder! I'm so tired. I said dance. Dance. Make it sexy. Rob told me you are an excellent dancer. So show me how you make the boys go wild. Dance. Jill? Open up the door. It's, it's Rob. Open up the door! God da... What? Are you okay? I'm fantastic, okay? You, you look... I've been calling you. Why haven't you answered? I've been worried about you. Would you get your hand off the chain? Let me help you. Let me help you, okay? Take your hand off the chain. I understand. What the fuck? Rob? We are back. It is the final dessert round, and one of these chefs will be preparing their last meal. Chef Amy, what are you preparing for us? Well, I have just put some delicate almond lady cakes in the oven. And I'm going to dress them with praline lace sponge sugar and a bit of fresh whipped cream. That sounds... There's been some kind of explosion. There's so much smoke. I can't locate chef Amy. She might be, she might be... I dominate. Was that your strategy all along, Chef Adam, to kill your opponent before her desert presentation? Are you that worried about Chef Amy's cooking skills? We knew this challenge would not go unanswered. How is she going to compete with the simplicity and elegance of her competitor's presentation? Ooh, love the undergarment. I think those are from the ecstasy collection,. Come on. Fuck me. Well, that's an approach. I thought with the panties, it would be classier. Rude and over the top! Looks like she's going back in the box. Ooh, I am liking this. This is showmanship. The audience is going wild. Did she study gymnastics? What? She majored in fashion merchandise at Parsons. I'll give her points for creativity. Who knew the body could bend like that? A for effort, but overall another disappointment. I wonder what she's getting. Does she have time for an extra ingredient? You know, I don't know, but she needs to pull this off if she wants to stay alive. Are those kumquats? Yes, they are. You eat those whole, is that right? Yes. The flesh, it's quite sour, but the skin is sweet. When eaten together they produce an unusual, but refreshing flavor. Fascinating. Oh, that is just sad. Theatrics didn't serve you well the last time. Who is throwing fruit?! Her muscle control is impressive. Game on. This is competition, ladies and gentleman. What a battle! Looks like she's going back to the Mystery Box. Handsome. This could be a game changer. Interesting! I am not prepared to evaluate this. You look like shit, she looks like shit, right? This is not in my contract. Crawl bitch! Are we cutting to commercial? Fucking crawl bitch! Come on, crawl! We're going to have to consult the rules. Come on, come to papa. Um... Bye, Rob. I hate this dress! Where'd you go? Baby... Baby. Oh, stop crying. Sorry. Fucking filthy! You're fucking filthy! You're so... Fucking fuck! You little fucking slut! You can't even stay out of my fucking dream. No! No, Jenny, no! Jenny? Jenny. Jenny! Hey, did you see Jenny? She lives right up there. She's got red hair. She's... in trouble. Why won't anybody help me? Jennifer! What? What? You okay? What happened? You are not fit for company. What are you doing out here? - No, no, no. - Miss. Miss. Oh, hi. What? Officers, thank you so much for being here. That's my roommate. She is having a really bad sleep disorder. It's been going on for months. And honestly, she's on a cleanse as well. And that's really messing up her sleep cycle. - Just settle down here a minute. - It's crazy. Why don't you sit back down there... catch your breath. Good idea. Miss. What? Have a seat. Calm down, please. Look at me. Tell me what's wrong. I told you, it's a nasty Master Cleanse, and the sleep deprivation. I mean, you know how it is trying to lose a few pounds, right? Not that I know, I mean, that you know, cuz you're really fit, in good shape. And your costume fits... I mean, outfit, or uniform, fits really good... Okay, okay, a cleanse, and sleep problems. But that doesn't explain... One can't just go out in public half dressed looking like that. Yes, that's what I'm telling her, all that time, right? But she wears... She hardly wears... She wears more... Less than this most of the time. I guess you'd only get away with that if you're sexy, right? Yeah, sex appeal is not the issue here. Right. Cuz you're not the, the fashion police. Obviously! We're here to help you. Thank you very much for your help, and I appreciate your service, all of your service. I just think she really needs a nap. You know? And a little bit of food, and I can give her that. So if you could just let us go now, that would be great. If you could just let us go, we won't cause any trouble, or anything. We're gonna have to write this up. Oh, come on, Timmy, there's something not right here. What else can we do? Take her in as a 5150. You wanna do the paperwork on that? Come on, Marie. My Tammy's about her age. You know how females are. Oh right, she may be on her period? - Officer, I... - Not what I'm saying- Miss, you need to stay where you were! Sorry, you know, you know, it's just I was... There's something that I didn't tell you that I didn't want to say in front of him. I didn't tell you all the truth. I know I'm supposed to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but I left something out. Cuz you see, there was this boy. Okay. It's your call, but if anything goes wrong, it's on you. Miss, we're gonna, take you back to your home here in the patrol car, okay? Home? Home. Yes. - It's okay. Come on. - Okay. Thank you so much, Officer. You're welcome Jenn, just relax okay, and lean back so I can get your front. We need to talk. Talk. You always had such great nipples, I never understand why Trevor didn't... Fuck, you scared the shit out of me today. I don't really wanna have to do any of this, but you give me no other choice. I thought you wanted to get rid of me. Of course not, no. I never wanted that, Jennifer. You are all I have. I don't know what I would do if you... Come on. What? It's cold. It's warm. Jennifer, no, look, hey, look it's steaming. Look, look. Take your hand. See? It's warm. Look, you see? It's warm. It's been so hard. I've been trying my best. After everything with Trevor, I've just been trying to get myself back. - I know. - So many expectations. - I just want to be free. - Yeah. Jilly? Yeah? You absolutely must take your cooking and share it with the world. Those are just experiments. But look at your resolve. You can do it, I know you want to. I can even help. - Help? - Of course. With our combined powers we'll be unstoppable. I'm glad we're talking. Yeah. Help! Somebody! Fucking do it! Are you kidding me? You need to look in the mirror. Crazy bitch. You have no right to judge me. You know I'll fucking do it, right? I'll fucking do it right now! There's no turning back, bitch. Ahh! You're not gonna fool me again. Sorry. Don't... It's a cinch. What the fuck? Enough is enough! Happy birthday! What? I didn't mean to be a Facebook stalker, but I couldn't help but see before that your birthday was coming up. Um... Well, I just wanted to apologize for being so pushy. I mean, sometimes my anal retentiveness gets the best of me. Thanks for friending me. That's your way of apologizing? Um... You know what? Everything Jennifer says about you... is true. I don't understand. I just wanted to do something ni... I am on to you. It needs more salt. Samantha Foxy? I know. - It's Rob. - Let it go to voice-mail. Look... Look how fat she looks there. She's trying to do little arms back look. I know. Wait. Oh my God. Why would she wear that color? I don't know. Fucking looks like a bag. Put a bag over her head. Old basket of rolls. She seriously looks like a basket of rolls. Like really lumpy ones that are two days old. Baguettes. Holla! Holla! Holla! She's a holla back girl. Oh, listen, listen. Hey, it's Rob. Uh, this is hard. I really thought we had a connection, but I can't... I can't even... I don't even know what to call it. But I just can't do this anymore. I mean us, and I can't... Why won't you let me help you? What the fuck is wrong with you? God, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lose my temper. It's just, I wish you... Look, I understand what you're going though, and I wish I could be better. But I have to... For the sake of my own sobriety, I just, I can't see you anymore. Oh my fucking God. "For the sake of my own sobriety." Pussy. Totes is a loser. Serio. Let the ruiner have him. Lame. - We don't need him. - No... Wait. What do you mean "we"? Cuz you know... you never had him. Wait. Yes, you did. You did! It's not, it's not Cathy. It's you, isn't it? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Why do you fuck everything up? Why do you do that? Fuck you! You think that you're just not gonna... You're just not gonna have any consequences? That you're just gonna be able to get away with it? What the fuck! You know what? You know what? You're gonna be punished. Oh yeah, you're going to be fucking punished. You don't have any food. None today and... you're not going to have any food tomorrow, either. You fucking bitch! God, why am I even your friend? Why? Would you tell me that? You... are... the ruiner... of everything. Me and Rob... and everything. What are you still doing here? Jennifer, wake up! Wake up, it's dinner time. Wake up. You will cheat... Will... submissive... Eyes open. Eyes open. Eyes closed. Weak, stupid... Stupid... cunt... No one ever... No one will ever want you. You don't deserve it. Stupid, ugly, useless, waste... Why are you still alive!? I hate you. I hate you, I hate you. I'm winning, I can smell your weakness. Flabby, puss filled... I'm not going anywhere. Arms. Suck that in. This is... Fashion Week. She's back. Really? I just saw her. Tell her to come to my office. Were you held hostage? Points for showing up on the big week. The outfit is an improvement... but no matter what this town tells you, flakiness is not fashionable. You're fired. Eat a sandwich. Oh, don't worry, Mina. These chemicals don't make you crave carbs. Get up, we need to talk. Come on, come on. Fashion waits for no one. Let's have some lunch and talk. I've made a great meal. I love cooking, but it's the eating part that doesn't do it for me. I am happy... about everything. Everything is perfect. I am perfect.
