Better go take a bath. It's time for school. Honey, can you take a bath for Tong? Go see your dad, okay? Why are you standing here naked? Wow! Yours is bigger than mine. - Go to the bathroom. - Alright. - Go take a bath. - I'm going. Have you done dressing, Poom? Yes, dad. You should help your mom set the table. Yes, dad. Petch... you go take a bath too. Come on! Be a good boy, alright? Though you don't have to go to school, Ning. You still need to brush your teeth. I'll take you to brush your teeth, then we can go eat. Luk-kaew, you better hurry or you'll be late for school. I wonder when she'll be more responsible. She's late everyday. Please go get her. Quick! Why don't you go get her yourself? Ride safely, okay? Bye bye, dad. Bye, sweeties. - Poom, be careful, okay? - Okay. How many time have I told you not to bring toys to school? I wanna play with them with my friends. Take them out! What's this? A slingshot? Go eat your breakfast. You take this shoelace on top of this and then pull it through here. Tong, can you help me? Pull it tight. You're pulling my finger. See? Pull your fingers back and make two bunny ears. Show me how a bunny cries. Squeak! Squeak! What kind of bunny is that? Is that right? You're all set. Your shoe's torn up. I'll buy you a new pair. Nah, I like it like that.. It's kind of cold. Why is it cold? It has ice in there. Ice? Why did you put ice in your shoe? I like to make it cold. No. It makes you wet. Get up! This toy is for boys. You can't play with it. What if you hit somebody on the head? Come on, eat! Don't too strict with her. It's just a toy. Tong, say goodbye to your mommy. Bye, mommy. I gotta go. I feel so good! I'm going, Ning. Blow me a kiss, will you? Ride safely, okay? Okay... Hold tight! Bye-bye. Have a safe trip, honey. Do you have a trivia quiz for me today? Yes. Okay... give it to me. Erase five from ten, what do you get? Ten minus five equals five, right? Wrong. Why is it wrong? Ten can't erase five because it's not an eraser. Are you trying to ask for it, son? Tong, hold daddy tightly, okay? Tong, sit still, okay? I think you should shred a few ounces, son. Let's go. Tong... Tong Luk-kaew! Come back here! Good morning. Why do you park your bike in front of my house? Well, it's a parking place, isn't it? Or you want me to park under the water. I gotta go now or I'll be late. Why don't you hang around with other kids. What's wrong with Tong? What did you say? Say it again. - What's wrong with Tong, sir? - That's better. Because he is a retard. What do you mean? Look at him. A snotty nose and drooling. Forget about him. Let's go. Bye, mom. What did you Just say? Goodbye, mommy. Don't be too hard on her. Let's go. Tong, do you see the monk? Yes, I do. If you get hungry, you can ask him for food. He is very kind. This way, sir. Pay attention in class, son. So you can be smart like your daddy. Have you said goodbye to me yet? Bye-bye. Bye, son. Yuck! You retard! Thank you. Tong. Okay. Why have you just got here? I stopped by at the market. I walked and got here before you. There's a traffic jam. Don't you get it? I walked and the traffic was fine. - Pay attention to your class. - Luk-kaew. Be a good girl and don't hang out with Tong. Tong, wait for me! Come in... through this way. Right here. Come here. Turn to the left a little bit. Now to the right. That's it. Thank you. Sumrouy. You don't need to help me. Go to that bus. I wanna help you take the luggage out. It's okay. I'll ask Muek to help me. - Thanks anyway. - No problem. What? Look where you're going. Excuse me. Muek, Paek wanna see you. Excuse me. Your mom's food is delicious. Do you want to taste my mom's food? - Is it good? - Yes. It smells so good. My wife really knows what I like. I'll eat it all. You retard, come to get your shoes back. Retard! Retard! Why are you mocking Tong? Mind your own business! Luk-kaew! You're a girl. Why are you acting like a boy? Don't hurt her. - You don't have to protect her. - Stop it. She beat the shit out of a boy at school. Oh my goodness! Are you alright? Don't pamper her! They were making fun of Tong. Who told you to help him? I forbid you to hang out with him, got it? I'll talk to her. You have overindulged her. You are too harsh on her. Damn it! Are you hurt, sweetie? Tong, let's go home. Have you finished your homework? Yes, I have. What did you draw? I drew dragonflies. Wow! They're so cute, just like you. Yeah. When I think of you, I draw dragonflies. Okay, let's go home. Daddy, can you buy me a pair of shoes? Tell me who did this to you. Berm. Did anyone help you? Yes, Luk-kaew helped me. Did you fight Berm back? No. That's good. You're a good boy. Good guys don't take revenge, alright? I love you more than anyone in the world. I love you very much as well. Honey, I'm home. We are home now. Honey, please give me a hand. Okay... take it easy. Be careful. Okay son, get off. Go help your brother. What happened to Tong's shoes? Berm did it. Let me see. Why did Berm bully our son? He is a bad boy, that's why. He always makes fun of Tong, right Petch? Yes. - What should we do then? - Hit his face. That's not good. You should warn him politely. Luk-kaew and I beat his gang up. You told me you didn't fight with them. So you lied to me, huh? Don't lie to your parents. If you keep doing this, no one will love you. I'm sorry that I lied to you. That's okay, my boy. - Don't lie again, okay? - Okay. Let's go. We should buy him a new pair of shoes. He can't wear this anymore. I don't know what happened to it. Let's get inside the house. I told you not to encourage her too much. Don't you see she's becoming a tomboy? I don't see any gentleness in her. What do you expect from a little girl? We need to teach her little by little. How? By letting her hang out with that retard? She'll become an idiot like him soon. You should be easier on her. No! I'll force her to do what I want. You are like this, so she is a hard-hitting girl. Damn it! Are you hurt? No, I just have to be doubled up. - Stay still. - Okay. Come on. Let's buy a pair of shoes for you. Good morning. You open your store pretty early, huh? Of course. I wanna buy some shoes for Tong. The shoes here aren't good. You might try other stores. But I wanna be your customer. You should go have a look at that store. - You like this store, don't you? - Yes. My son likes your store. I'm afraid none of them will fit him. Let's try looking for it. - You might have a good one. - Have what? Well, Sumrouy is here to buy shoes. We intend to be your customer. There are no shoes here. Go buy somewhere else. We like your store. That's why we come here. I don't sell anything to retards. Beat it! I don't sell anything to you, moron. Go away! It's alright. Thanks anyway. Let's go, son. They don't wanna sell to us. Tong! Tong, get out of here. Quick! You idiots are out of your mind, huh? Tong, come here. Why did you do that? Have I told you not to cause trouble? Stop running. Come back here, Tong. Don't run away from me, Tong. Tong, don't run away from me. I'm sorry. Where have you been? Take a seat here. Why don't you listen to me? Do you realize what you done was wrong? You damaged other people's stuff. It's bad, you know that, right? Yes, I know. I've never hit you before, but I'm forced to do it now. You can't disobey me again, you know? This is what you get when you disobey. You have to behave yourself, understand? Daddy, nobody loves me. Yes. Nobody seems to loves us, because they don't like what we are. You shouldn't make them hate us more. Can you do that? Yes. Even though no one else loves you you still have your family who really love you. - Do you love me? - Of course. - You will be a good boy? - Yes, I will. Are you hurt? Can Tong go play with me? See? You have Luk-kaew who loves you too. You should smile Give Luk-kaew a big smile, will you? You two can go play now. Thank you. Go ahead. They're the two that beat me up. You got beat up by little kids? You think you are very tough, huh? Stop! Don't hurt him or I'll tell my dad. Telling your dad? Tong, run! What are you looking at? Go get 'em! Be careful, son. Come on, Tong. Get them! - Where are you going? - Get out of my way. Very good. What a horrible kid! How dare you push me? Have you seen them? They're running over there. Tong, hurry up! Get inside. I'm sure you can't find my son. Those stupid kids. We can go now. Paek... stop the bus! Stop it. Tong... Tong... Uncle Sumrouy. Tong is in there. Tong and Luk-kaew. Sumrouy, what are you doing?

You lie to me. You're fired. Get the hell out of here! Why don't you believe me? Tong... Tong Help! We're stuck in here. Tong... Tong... Tong! Tong! What should we do? I don't know where the bus is gonna take us? I don't know either. Please... stop the bus. I can't hear your daddy anymore. Daddy! Have you two seen my daughter? I've just seen her running around with Tong. Alright, you can get back to work. Honey! Tong was in the bus and it took him away. What's wrong? Tong... Tong Tong, what? Tong got stuck in the bus. That retarded Sumrouy told me that... Luk-kaew and Tong were on the bus to Bangkok. I've tried to call Paek. You call him again. Let me hear. Nobody answers the phone. Don't cry. I'll try to get in touch with Paek again. If we cant contact him, I'll go look for Luk-kaew in Bangkok. Don't worry, honey. It's my responsibility. If Tong doesn't come back home tonight, I'll go look for him. I promise. I'll bring him back home no matter what. You should have some rest. Your dad forbids you to play with me, right? My dad will punish me if I hang out with you. But I'm not afraid at all. Why are you so nice to me? Remember the day we played at the pond? Help! Help! Luk-kaew falls into the water! Help! Help!
