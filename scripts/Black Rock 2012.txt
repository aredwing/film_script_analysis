You got your... your mom's tent, I see. - Which is a classic. Oldie, but goodie. - Sarah: Yes. - Of course. - We got "people," "ok!," "star." Sarah: We are going to an empty island. Woman: Oh, my God! There's like 10 of them! - This is horrible news. - Sarah: We need entertainment. - There's nothing else there. - I'm there. - Yeah, you're very pretty. - I have so many stories. There's only so long I can look at you and just be like, "you're so pretty." And then I need to look at trash. You know what I mean? - Right. - I'm fucking happy, man. You know, I'm happy. I'm happy we're here. I'm happy, too. I'm excited. # Steal them back for me, love # # oh, yeah # steal them back for me, love # # oh, yeah... - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Woman: "We got crabs." - I can't even... - like, that's crazy... - I feel like we should go in there and just tell them that they need to take that down. At least they're being up front and honest about it - 'cause usually, you know, - That's true. Guys don't tell you, and then, you know what, you end up - with a pantyful of lice. - The whole... That is really, really disgusting. # Be careful where you lean # # and when you're lost under the blue sky # # look down and you'll find me # # yeah... - Sarah: We're here. - I know. - It's a long time coming. - It is crazy. - How long has it been for you. - Sarah: Like eight years. Eight years, are you serious? That's weird. Is that... are you serious? - Sarah... - Is that... - ...why is Abby sitting right there? - Oh. Why would you not tell me this? This is such a bad idea. Let's look at this like an opportunity. - She... - Come on. It's gonna be good. - This is, like, unreasonable. - Come on. - Hey, abs. - What are you doing? - Give me a hug. - What are you doing? No, no. - Love me, love me. - What is this? You were like, "oh, let's go on this great weekend. You and me." - I know. - "We're gonna go out to the island. We'll reconnect. It'll be so awesome. You and me." - I know. - Yeah, that's kinda... kinda what you said to me. - I'm sorry. I know. - You and me. - I'm sorry. - You know what, I'm just, like... - I took time off to come up here. - Do you wanna punch me? I have a really crazy life right now, okay? I don't have the time, energy, interest... - Give me just a slap in the face. - In, like, dealing with - all of this shit, okay? - But it's gonna be so good. You can say my name, Abby. You're not gonna fucking get leprosy. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys, guys. - Thanks, Lou. Thank you. Hello? Guys, this is gonna be so great. - We're here. - Okay, I'm gonna go. So you guys have a really great weekend, though. It was great to see you both, honestly. I'm sorry. I'm with Abby on this one. Seriously, like, I hear where you're coming from and you're sweet, but it's, like, it's not a good call, man. It's like... Great. Let's just... We'll do it another time. I have cancer. What? I didn't wanna say anything. I didn't wanna ruin the trip. I didn't want it to be about that. I wanted it to be about us. - They say four to six months. - What?! They say four to six months, but seriously, I've come to terms with it. It's okay. It's okay. The thing that I want most, more than anything in the world, is to have this final hurrah, just the three of us together. Can we do that? - Yeah, yeah. - Can we do that? - Of course. - Yes, yeah. Can we do that? Yes, we can? - Yes, yes. - Seriously, can we do that? 'Cause I'm just riddled with it, you know? Just... it's everywhere. What? - Are you fucking with me right now? - ( Laughs ) - I know... - You don't have fucking cancer? No... I do not have cancer, - oh, my God. - But I do have a very good... - oh, my God. You're such an asshole. - Did you just say that you - have cancer so that we... - That you guys... you... - I don't have cancer. - Are you serious? - Oh... - But the thing is... look it, you guys. That was bad. That was a bad, bad thing to say and do. That was a horrible thing to say! That was a horrible thing to do, but here's the thing: We are all dying. That's the truth. We have no idea what's gonna happen. We don't know. We could be hit by a bus tomorrow, you know? - We could... we have no idea what's gonna happen. - Oh, my God. And I'll tell you one thing for certain... there are no buses on that island. - Okay. - You know, so we can go out there and be safe from buses, - which is great. - I still, like... I can't... - shit is great. - You're such a... - i want us back. - This is so bad. - Say yes. - Oh, God. - You were looking at me like, "yeah, you're so in." - You're an asshole. Say yes, abs. Is it a yes? - I'm going, but I'm not happy. - Yay! - I love you. - I hate you. Yay, let's go camping! It's gonna be so good, guys. Fresh air, you know? New beginnings. Fresh start. There she is, guys. What a beauty. - Wow. - First-class travel. Pass me some stuff. Do you even know how to start this motor? I mean, I think so. Abby: That's got sunglasses. Oh, sorry. - ( Motor puttering ) - ( Cheering ) I have got this. Hi. It's a really big knot. - Let me give you a hand. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - And that's how it's done, ladies. - You got it? - Ta-da. - Here we go. - Let's do this. Here we go, guys. - More to the left? - To the right. - To the right? - There's a rock right here. Yeah. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God. I don't wanna. - Oh, my God! Abby! - Oh, my God. It was too soon. - I'm soaked. - Wow. - Well done, woman. - Yeah. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Maybe you need to just dry off a little bit? Yeah, you think? Oh, my God. - I have my smiley face on, I have my smiley face on. - You're good. You guys did a really good job. It was a really good job. Look at that. Oh, you're one of the greats, Sarah. Did I mention that the water was actually really, really, really cold? - Yup. - Oh. - Oh, my God. - How nice is it, though, guys? Look at... I mean, look at the view, though. - I know. - It's so beautiful. It smells exactly the same. It smells like childhood to me. Does anyone mind if I, like, check my phone really quick? Is that, like, gonna kill the mood? - No, do it. Do what you gotta do. - 'Kay. Urgent text situation. No, just addicted to my phone. Lol. Omg. I don't even think people say that anymore. Aw. Whatever. I don't care. There's no reception. I'm totally fine with it. What are we gonna do while we're here? Is this it? It's not it, is it? - No? - I have a plan. - Like... like a Sarah plan? - Wow, wait a second. Hold up. - Sarah has a plan? - Of course Sarah has a plan. Okay. Oh, no. Oh, God. Okay. - Okay, guys. Close your eyes. - Okay. Keep 'em closed. We are walking down the stairs... - very dark, dark, dark stairs... - I'm scared. Into a basement. And there's Greg sr. And he's there with all his friends. - We take... come on. - I'm sorry. We take him out, we sit down, - and we watch a hundred times... - "Goonies." - "Goonies"! - Oh, my God. You're such a dork. - You brought the map to the time capsule. - Yes! - Oh, boy. Here we go. - Just hold on. You did it. - One for you, madam. - Oh, we each get our own. - One for you, missy. - I'm excited. - This is gonna help us. - So guys, look. - Was this it? - This is it. - Seriously? - This is so awesome, dude. This is our map. - Look it. We are here. - No, I get that we are here, but, like, this isn't gonna take us anywhere. - Yeah, it is. - Do you see what this is showing us? - Yes. No, it's pretty self-explanatory. - No. - This is us. - Oh, obviously. - This is Sheila beal's tits. Remember? - And you take four dashes - to the left and then you're at the fort and the time capsule. - Right. I've checked it out. I mean, the coordinates are right. I mean, generally. - We were 10. - I know, but it's gonna be great. - Abby, dude. Don't poo-poo it. - Seriously, think of it like an adventure, you guys. Lou, dude. I'm good. I'm just questioning the, uh... I hear that, but it's great, Sarah. Sarah, this is great. Let's do it. - Yeah? - Yes. - Yeah? - Hey, I am down. - I am so pumped. - Let's do it, you guys. Let's find it. - Serious. - So... - Let's go. - But I am still so wet. - I think it's northeast and then that means... - No, it's definitely northeast. - She was really beautiful. - Remember her? I can't hear you, Sarah. Sasha. The girl that was really pretty in school. - The exchange student. She's gay. - Yeah. - What? - She's gay now. - I know. - But then I was thinking maybe, like... - I don't know. I'd make out with her. - I know. I was, like, if I had to go gay, like, Sasha Warren would be the girl, right? - Where is she from? - It was like Ukraine or something. Sarah: Yeah, I mean, I think it's just, like... northeast is straight up into... - just gonna go up into this.. - Lou: No, it was Denmark. - Oh, fuck. Denmark. - Yeah. - I just... I just remembered. - I just feel like all Danish are just, like... but the truth is, like, you just... like, I would be fine with, like, smooching, but, like, I don't know if I could, like, - you know, go the whole hog. - There's the tree. Oh, the tree that looks like Abby taking a dump. You guys, it doesn't even look like that at all. It's just, like, it's a tree... it's a stump. No, but it's definitely like a... um... - It's like a bent-over shape. - Silhouette. Guys, I think we should just throw it in. We're not gonna find this fucking fort. - No, I think it's... - It's just... yeah, that's part of the adventure, Abby. - Just go with it. - Well, it was really fun when we were 10, but now I'm just getting eaten alive by mosquitos. - Jesus Christ. - What? - Huh? - Not you. You. You're rolling your eyes at me, what? - Um... - What is your problem? - I don't have a problem, Abby. - I'm sensing a serious attitude here. - What is going... what? - You are honestly sensing attitude - from me at this point? - Mm-hmm. I am. - I... - You know, you don't need Sarah's permission to just tell me what's on your mind. Abby, please. Like, let's just... we're out here, you know, it's so fucking beautiful, right? I mean, we haven't been here in so long. Look, Sarah doesn't have cancer. That's good. That's... - Like, let's go have some fun. - I agree. I think we should just keep going. I wanna know what the fuck your problem is, Lou. Oh, my God. Are we really gonna do this? Do what? Abigail, come on. It was fucking ages ago and I apologized. Oh, no, no, no. I wasn't even talking about that. - Oh, really? - Yeah, I'm totally over it. I'm great. You're clearly not over it. Can we just call that out? - You are the one that brought it up. - I brought it up because you are making it very difficult for us to just, like, have a nice time right now. Because of some stupid indiscretion that happened, like, six years ago. - Oh, is that how you see that? - Yes. You really see fucking my boyfriend of two years... the guy who I was pretty sure I was probably gonna marry maybe someday... you thought that was just a small, stupid indiscretion? We were children at that point and we were both fucking drunk and the guy was, honestly, like a class-a douchebag. Like, you should be thanking me that you didn't walk down the aisle with that guy. All right, well, thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you so much, Lou, for fucking my boyfriend. - I don't mean it like... - I appreciate it with all of... - I feel really badly about it. - You were my best friend and if you're calling him a douchebag, I would love to know what the fuck that makes you. Lou: I don't even know why we're talking about it still at this point because you have this amazing life. You're fucking married. You're married. Don't... don't talk like you know anything about my life right now. - You are not a part of my life, Lou. - Why even... - you have not been a part of my life for a really long time. - That is your doing. - And do you wanna know why? - That's your doing. Because you never, ever apologized. - I have apologized to you thousands of times... - You said you were sorry - and you never meant it! Never! - What?! - You would look at me like I was stupid and overreacting. - Just can't win. - And taking it too far. - You took a fucking sledgehammer... - yeah, I wanted to take it to your goddamn fucking face! - You fucking threw it... - okay, guys! - You wanna go in... - yes! I would love to fucking smash your face in! - Guys, guys, guys! - No, if there's a time to do it, do it now. - Sarah: No. - Guys, stop it. - I would love to, Lou. - All right, well, then, bring it. - Please. - Great. - Stop it, guys. This is crazy. - Just take a fucking time-out. - I agree that it's crazy. - Great, I'm the crazy one. - Guys, please, please, please, - just stop. - I'm a crazy fucking bitch. Dude... I know. I mean, this is just, like... - this is just... cannot. - She started it. Can I say that? Let's go, let's go chase Abby 'cause she's got a problem. ( Crows cawing ) Lou: I feel like all three of us in this tent is not gonna be good. All things considered. I know. Sarah: I mean, obviously this went a lot different in my head. - You know, we were having fun and... - I know. - I'm sorry. - This is so crazy because when I think about the three of us, like, back in the day... I feel like we were the crazy ones and she was, like, sweet. - She was sweet Abby and now she's crazy Abby. - She has been acting really... I don't know. She's just been off. - What do you mean? - I don't know. She just doesn't wanna talk about it, which, as you know, for Abby, is really weird. Yeah. Jesus. ( Sighs ) I mean, the truth is, though, what happened was pretty fucked up. - Yeah, I know, Sarah. I know. - Yeah, I know you know. I know you know and I'm not trying to take sides, - but I'm just... Lou, I'm trying to put a certain. - Oh, my God. Perspective on it where I'm looking at someone over there who's really, really, really hurt. And I know for you, you were young and whatever and you're... - yeah. - I know and you've moved past it and I can look at it and I can be past it, but it didn't happen to me. Like, I think for her, it was a game changer. ( Sighs ) Okay, um... Excuse me. So... I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna sit here... And... You can say whatever you wanna say to me. You wanna call me names or... Get up in my face. - I'm just gonna sit here. - ( Screams ) Lou: What?! What?! - Man: Whoa, whoa. - What the fuck is that? Fuck! - What is that? - Sarah: What is it, what is it? - Nothing, it's nothing. - Three hunters up there. - Man: Are you guys all right? - Sorry, it was really scary. - Jesus Christ. Hey. - Man: Hey. - Hi. - Hey. Um... Is that Henry? Is that... i think I know that guy. - Shut up. - Is that Henry Wallace? - Yeah. - That is crazy. You scared the living shit out of us. I, um...

Well, we are just camping here. - Yeah. - Just for a couple of days and... what? How is the hunting going? Is it good? It's not too good. Well, we were, uh... we were gonna eat what we killed, and, uh, well, so far we ain't ate a thing. - ( Laughs ) - Oh. Sucks. - Alex: Yeah. - All right.

I totally remember that and was I not supposed to say it out loud? - I... - But she did. - She did. - If we're counting. - It was a hand job, but, um... - Hey, so I don't even want - to interrupt or anything, but... - My lips are sealed. - ( Whispers ) I like your beard. - Wow. - I do.

Henry wouldn't tell you this, but he... I mean, he'd deny it. Just flat out, but he saved both our lives. Hell, he saved the whole squad in helmand province. Wow. What happened? We got, uh... we came up on a bunker that we thought was abandoned and it was just a bad report. Before we knew it, we were just... Getting shot at. - Shit. - Henry Wallace. - Yeah. - You know, like, little Henry Wallace. I... I... usually when you hear about a local hero, you see it in the headlines, and I just had no idea. - I didn't hear anything about that. - Yeah, well. I would have heard about him. Our superiors didn't really approve of our tactics. Sometimes you can't go by the book, you know? I mean, you can't follow every single rule. Shit gets outta hand. You gotta do what you gotta do to get the job done. They sent us back home... ( Clears throat ) Dishonorable discharge. No fucking medals. ( Chuckles ) No shit. But I'll tell you what. The fucking government... they may not say it, but, Henry, boy, he's still a fucking hero. Fuck, yeah, he is. I... oh, Henry, stop. Can you get off? Can you just get off me for a second? - Just get off me. - Oh, no. Get off me, Henry. - ( Muffled scream ) - You wanna have some fucking fun, baby? All right, let's have some fucking fun.

What'd you do to him?! - Can you hear me, Henry? - What happened, what happened? - Is he hurt? - Henry, it's Derek. - Keep your fucking eyes open, okay? - Listen, listen. Hey, hey. - Keep your eyes open. That's good. That's good. - Hey, man. - Hey, man. We're gonna get you some help. - Don't close them. - Henry, don't fucking close your eyes! - What?

Stop it! - Stop! Stop it! - ( Groans ) Can you use your head? Use your fucking head. Sarah, Sarah. - Wake up. - Oh, my God. Shit. Lou, Lou. Derek: Part of me wants to do this shit... just fucking haji style, bro. Just saw their fucking heads off. Calm the fuck down, Derek, okay? Let's just think about this. Just for a second. What is there to fucking think about? You think I didn't... you think I didn't want to beat them to a fucking bloody pulp? I did! We both did. Now all I'm saying is let's just think about this, all right? They're just... they're just fucking girls, okay? They're girls. They're somebody's daughter. They're somebody's sister. They're not fucking haji. That bitch killed Henry. - Fuck, man. - He's fucking dead, Alex. What the fuck do you wanna do? Never... We gotta get outta here. Can you get your hands free? No. I'm totally stuck. - Are you? - These fucking... are you ready to die, bitch? Okay, guys. I'm gonna talk to him. - I'm going. - Abby: What are you gonna say? I'm just gonna talk to them. I'm gonna look at 'em and I'm gonna talk to 'em. ( Sighs ) Okay, okay, guys, okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Derek, listen. - Shut up. Shut up. - What happened to Henry was a terrible, terrible... - Shut up. Fucking mistake, okay? It was an accident. Abby is sorry. She is sorry, but please, understand that what she did was protecting herself. Can you get that? She thought that he was going to rape her. Can you understand that? Can you get that? Here's what I get. Your fucking slut friend lures my buddy up into the woods... flirting with him all night. Smashes his fucking head in with a rock. That's what I understand. - Sarah: Okay, okay. You're right. - That's what I understand. - You're right. - Okay? Let's go to the police. Let's tell them everything... We'll just... you can fucking tell them whatever you want. Listen to me! Listen! Don't cry. Don't fucking cry. ( Sarah whimpering ) You fucking pussy. What did you say? You gotta tie up three girls to a tree to kill them? - I think you're a fucking pussy! - ( Chuckling ) - If we're gonna do this, man, let's just fucking do it. - Hold on a second. - Let's just fucking do it, man. - Hold on a second. Wait, wait. Do you think I'm scared of you? Whoa, fuck. ( Screams, grunts ) She's got some spunk. How 'bout you fucking untie me like a real man? How 'bout you fucking untie me and let me show you?! - I will show you what I can do! - Shut the fuck up! - I will show you! - Shut up! ( Screams, whimpering ) - Alex: This is fucking crazy. You fucking kidding me? - Watch this, watch this. - You're fucking kidding me. - Watch this. - You got a move? - Huh? - ( Screams ) - Go! - ( Screams ) - Ah! - Go! Run! - Derek: Up the hill! - Get her up the fucking hill! - Alex: Go, go! ( Gunshot ) - ( Gunshot ) - ( Crow caws ) ( Water burbling ) ( Gunshot ) ( Gunshot ) Derek: We been hunting shoddy jihad for three fucking years. What the fuck makes you think this comes out good for you? - Derek. - Yeah. - What the fuck you doing? - What? What the fuck is... why'd you do that? Why'd you let 'em go, huh? You said you were gonna kill 'em and now we're gonna have to. - Huh, you fucking moron? - Jesus, don't worry. We'll find 'em. We came out here to hunt. We'll just hunt 'em down. Do you hear that? We're gonna find you! And I'm gonna kill you! It's on. I'm gonna kill all three of you! One by one! With my bare fucking hands if I have to! ( Crow cawing ) ( Rustling ) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God, you guys. I didn't think I was gonna see you guys again. - We're alive. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Are you? Abby: Oh, my God, you guys. I am so scared. I am so sorry. I don't know what happened last night. - I just... - No, no, no. - It went so far and I messed up. - Abby... - I didn't mean to kill him. - This is not your fault. - Abby, it's not your fault. - This is crazy. This is not your fault. - No, no, no, no. - ( Stammering ) Okay, you did what you thought you had to do in order to survive, okay? Listen, listen, guys, listen. We are on a small island and we need to get off. We need to figure out what to do. Maybe... We can stay here 'cause they don't know where we are here. The woods are dense and... and maybe they'll go away, you know? No. - No. - They're not going away. Lou, they're not going away. Did you see them? - Yeah. - They're not gonna stop. No. We have to get to our boat. They'll wait for us at the campsite. They know exactly where it is. They have a boat. Let's get their boat. - It's Jimmy's boat. - But where is it, Lou? - We can't just walk around the island. - We're not gonna go traipsing - around the island 'cause they'll find us. - Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Sarah: We need to think of something. We wait until it's dark. We wait until it's dark and we go to our boat. - Let's do that. - Sarah: Okay. So we just wait. ( Faint noise ) Did you hear that? Sarah: There it is. Okay. - They cut the rope. - Damn it. - How far do you think it's out there? - Abby: I don't know. It's far, you know? It's far. Tide's going out. If anything, it's probably going further away. - Lou: We can swim that. We can swim that. - No. No, we cannot fucking swim that. Are you fucking crazy? It's freezing. We get hypothermia in less than 15 minutes in fucking August. It's not that far. We can do this. We have to. What else are we gonna fucking do? No, guys. We'll fucking die in that water. Abby: I'm a good swimmer. I can do this. You guys go back to the fort. You stay safe. You stay covered. I'll get to the boat, get to the mainland, and come back with the cops. There is no sense with the three of us risking our lives out here. We can't do that. We can't. Worst case... They get me and you guys use the distraction... you just head for the boat. Go for the boat. - You just... - No. - Yes. Yes. - No. We are in this together. She's right. It's the three of us now. - Okay. - Thank you for offering that. All right. I'm gonna go first. If I get to the boat before you do, i will row back for your fat asses. Because you're probably going to be drowning behind me. Let's go. Abby: Okay, we can do this. Just stay low and quiet. ( Whispering ) Guys... Sarah: This doesn't feel right. Guys? - I don't know. - Shh, Sarah. Guys. Guys! - We're not gonna make that out there. It's too fucking far. - It's not far. - We got this, Sarah. - It's too far. - Shh. - We're not gonna make it, Abby! - Shh! - It's too far out there! - It's too far! - We've got this, Sarah! - It's too far!

( Gunshot ) - Fuck! - Fucking help me, man! - All right, all right. - Shit, man. - Oh, fuck. - What does it look like?! - Don't move it. Don't move. - ( Screams ) It's bad. It's not that bad, it's not that bad. - All right, all right. - Oh, God darn it. - I'm here with ya. All right, we'll take care of it. - It hurts, man. You'll be fine. Come on. Come on. Get up. - I can't... I can't... - Get up. ( Shivering ) Abby: We have to... we have to get warm, okay? Take all the wet stuff off. Okay? Take it off. - What? - Take the wet clothes off. Oh, I can't. I can't. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. It's too cold. Body... for body heat. Huddle, huddle. - Shh. - Yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I know. - I know. - Sarah... I know. Oh, God. I can't believe this is happening. No. I can't believe this is fucking happening right now. This is actually happening to us. These are soldiers. Trained soldiers, Abby. They're trained to kill people. They have guns. They're... ( whispering ) What do we have? What do we... we have nothing. - They're gonna kill us, they're gonna kill us... - Shut up. Okay? If they hear you, they're gonna kill us really fucking fast, so shut up. - Look at me. - I can't. - Abby, I can't. - Lou, Lou. We are getting off this island, okay? You and me. You and me. We are the only two people in the world right now. The whole wide world. You and me. We are not gonna fucking die on this island. Okay? Lou. Lou.

Okay. - ( Branch cracks ) - Shh. Wait, wait. What is that? Spears. Abby... I feel so ashamed for what I did to you. I'm so angry that I sabotaged that. I can't believe I'm 30 years old and I just... Feel so unhinged, you know? I left Mike. I hadn't even told Sarah yet. And... the stuff with you and me... You know, I know that... I've held onto that for a really long time. I just... I always felt like it was so much... Easier to blame you for... Things not working out... Than it was to just... Admit that maybe I had messed it up. It's easier to put it on you. I'm really sorry. - Good. - ( Laughs ) Abby: That must be their boat. Down there. I don't see the other one. Neither do I. - Are we gonna do this? - Yup. If we're gonna do it, we've gotta do it right now. - Yup. - I'll fucking do it. - I'll do it. - No, no. I wanna do it. I wanna do it. Oh, God. You cover my back, okay?
