On section No. 7... "Audiovisual Violence" I need more material What kind? Footage never shown on TV because of its violent nature You have access to the library You could get me interesting material You find this stuff interesting? Not personally, only for my project - Violent footage... - As violent as possible It would a bit awkward asking for films of such nature They'd think I'm a freak I can't promise anything - Come back tomorrow - Thanks Right, see you next week And keep going to the cinema Are you Chema? I'm Angela Cool! Listen, I hear you like violent films and have quite a collection Of what? You know, gore, porn... It's false and you can't have them anyway Go to a sex shop if you want a turn-on It's for my thesis: Audiovisual Violence Try Mickey Mouse So you want to see the tapes? So you do have them? Yes or no? You, students, like shooting off your mouth about film-making But you know zilch about movies What do you know about it? What I've got in here You two-faced sods say my films are crap, but you're all dying to see them It's for my thesis... I'm not interested in your - Come on in Do you want some? No, thanks Right to the point, then - very well Don't say I didn't warn you Do you live with burglars? I live alone - No parents? - They don't live in Madrid This was my grandmother's. She died last year Don't touch anything No one's allowed here. You're lucky Why me? You're gorgeous - Thanks - You were born that way Sit down, I don't charge for it What do you want to see? What have you got? All types of porn Soft, hard, violent, Eastern, you name it - all hot stuff I'm not interested in this kind of porn, if that's all you have to offer... You want action, then? Very well... I need the really violent stuff Really violent? How nice. You'll get off on this then What is it? "Fresh Blood" - a very beautiful and educational film What are they doing? What do you think? Removing his brain God... That's what you wanted, so don't get squeamish It's all real: executions, beatings, lynchings... great stuff - Hello... - Hello, Mr Figueroa I need a favour I'm looking for a Czech film but I don't remember the title Can I check the tapes? - You mean, in the storeroom? - I know it's irregular, but... Come with me... You know, it's odd... no one ever asks to go in But you're the second one today Is that so? He came in a moment ago... Professor? He can't hear me Right, it's arranged by genres. I'll leave you to it Shouldn't we wait for him to finish? No, I don't think you'll bother him - Unless it bothers you... - No, of course not It's so large, you won't bump into him See you "Pornography etc., Shelf 5H" It's horrible! Do people really watch such films? You do, for one That's different, I don't enjoy them It's loathsome Ever seen anyone killed? What do you think? Not TV killing, real life killing This is real. What more do you want? You don't get me I've never seen anyone killed Mr Figueroa, we have to close now Well, that's it - Hi, bookworm - Have you seen Figueroa? So you go for older men, do you? Did you find him? He didn't come to class, nor did you. Where were you? Never mind... I'm off Can a film kill someone? A heart attack or something like that... ...caused by what they see Not again! Wasn't yesterday enough? You're a real sadist, aren't you? If so, you'd even fuck a freak like me I've got money We're off... - Sena? - Coming! Sure you won't come? No, I must work on my thesis Then you'll want to borrow my clothes! Don't work too hard... - Mum? - What? - What's on this tape? - What tape? In the VCR. Did you watch it last night? See what it is - It's mine - Can't I watch it? - It's for my thesis... it'll bore you! - How do you know? I bet it's not just a reportage Silence! Please quiet down Hello everyone I suppose you've all heard the sad news Prof. Figueroa died on Tuesday He was found in the screening room Apparently he had an asthma attack while watching a film I bet it was a Spanish film You saw the film? Did you take it? My name is Castro Jorge Castro I'm a professor of Audiovisual Psychology, as some of you know I'll be replacing Prof. Figueroa for the time being I know the programme quite well... ...so we should be able to carry on as normal Which reminds me... Angela Marquez? I believe Prof. Figueroa supervised your thesis I'd be happy to take it on We can discuss it whenever you like You're losing it I'm not. You found him dead and took the tape I didn't! She did it! She took the tape! - Why should I show it to you? - Because I showed you mine - Why do you want it? - Why do you? - It's for my thesis... - Bullshit! What the fuck's on it? I don't know What? I haven't seen it yet You're stupid or what? Your place or mine? Give me the tape Let the fun begin I can't! Your loss Switch it off! It's real! What? A girl, tied to a chair, being beaten by a guy wearing a balaclava Why are you doing this to me? Shit, this is horrible! I can't... What's he going to do to her? Don't watch! I don't want to Don't look! Don't look! I know her She was at the university She disappeared two years ago Is she dead? What else? They blew her brains out What are they doing now? - Cutting her up - Jesus! Switch it off! I knew it! The bastard's a butcher Her name was Vanessa Why did they do it to her? It looks like a garage, doesn't it? Yes, it's a garage - It is a garage! - So what? - She was tortured and killed - You don't say! How can you watch this filth? - You stole that filth! - I didn't know what it was No, but you had an idea... deep down you like it - What did you say? - You heard me That's really stupid! - Wait, what the hell's this? - I'm not watching! I'm talking of the texture The horizontal lines... I only see intestines... You've learnt nothing in 5 years. The texture's different So? It's a digital zoom! The bugger used digital zoom So what? We can find the camera he used How many cameras have digital zoom? 5000? 1 0,000? How many were there two years ago? Not many Very few Autofocus, light control, stabilizer, stereo mike... Shit! Here: "Digital zoom - the centre of the picture gets..." B-2000 - it only came out this year Let's see... Stroboscopic effect, solar effects... I'm sure that was the one The XT-500? Fuck, that's it! The XT-500 Here it is, I'm sure Autofocus, audio dubbing... digital zoom "This feature offers... "...a significant enlargement of the original." There you go... He used a XT-500 - It's the Hl-8 system, I think - Fascinating... - Well, I'm going home for dinner - You're hungry? No, scared Don't take it with you I want to see it again Her parents haven't heard from her Sena, come here Did you search my room? Why? Of course not I hate people snooping around It wasn't me Well, someone's been looking around It wasn't me You were after that tape, right? Leave me alone It's Chema. I've got something I'm not interested, got it? - Someone's been in my room - What? Calm down, will you? - No one knows, don't panic! - Of course not You'd better check your room as well No one's been in here But I must show you something - I can't... - Yes, you can! - I don't want to! - Yes, you do! It didn't seem important at first No, please, don't... please! "Please..." " Please..." There! What? It's a cut Look again No, please, don't... please! Why are you doing this to me? It's been edited Not just here, it's full of cuts All done in the same way - very subtle He's almost in the same position So why the cut? You want to see everything in films like these The more you see, the better So why cut it? So we won't see something Why me? Please - She was going to say something What? Something he doesn't want us to hear His name - She knew who he was - So what? So now we know something about him You sound like the police Hey, don't insult me We must find who were her friends He might be one of them Look... I've had enough of this You're scared Of course I am, this isn't a game. It's real killing Piss off, then. I'll do this on my own You don't get it - I said it's over! For you as well I don't want any trouble - I won't get you into trouble - So what will you do? Go after anyone with a camera like that? And if you find him? Or he finds you? That's my problem Too right it is I've never been here, I don't know you and I've never seen that tape What is cinema? Cinema is an industry, it's money It's millions invested in films and then retrieved at the box office We have no cinema because it's not seen as industry There's no communication between the makers and their public We've reached a critical stage Spanish cinema can only be saved if it's accepted as an industrial factor You, as students of cinema, are the future of Spanish cinema Save it! The American industry... ...is strangling you and there's only one way to fight it: Give the public what it wants Don't forget that Angela, right? How do you do... - A drink? - No, thanks Here's my project Don't be so formal, I'm not that old I've neglected it lately Never mind, I just want to get an idea Anything else I need to know? Excellent "University Student Disappears" "Where is Our Daughter? "Court Blocks New lnquiry in Vanessa Romero's Case" That's all for today... see you tomorrow Don't forget to bring in your work What do you want? What do you want of me? This is yours! Are you doing Journalism? No, cinema and TV - One of us? - Give it to me, please Is this a project you're working on? No... well, yes, it's a project - You're in luck then - Why? I knew her A friend of my girl. I know what happened That's alright, thanks... I've got all I need There are things you don't know Where were you? Yolanda, this is... Angela She's doing a project on Vanessa Can I have a word? Hi, roadrunner Is it really a project or are you kidding me? No, it's true And the camera? Camera? For the project? Oh, of course - Well, the truth is... - You're confused What? No, the thing is... we still haven't got it We've got to get authorization Will this do? I've had enough! It's bullshit You've got to help me! To interview him? He pushed me Pushed you? What does one ask a killer? Was Vanessa a normal girl? I'm glad you asked: she was a wonderful girl, full of life... ...until I killed her, of course Did she mix with wierd types? No, she was a saint Did Vanessa seem odd prior to her disappearance? What do I know? - Do you think she was killed? - You can't ask that! - It's fundamental - You'll fuck up if you ask that If I don't, he'll think I'm avoiding the issue Who care what he might think. This isn't your thesis What is it? I'm leaving Why? Because Great Alright, I'm sorry Where are my keys? So what's his name? Where are my keys? - What's this? - These are my sister's - I never lose my keys - Welcome to the club This is Bosco and this is Chema How's it going? - Is that the camera? - Chema's the cameraman - You know how it works? - I think so When you're ready Bosco was in class with Vanessa Can you tell us what happened? Well, Vanessa didn't come to class for several days When we phoned her, they said she's disappeared The police looked for her for months but we never heard from her again You think she was kidnapped? Some say so, but it's absurd She sent one letter in which she wrote.... ...that she was in love with some guy and ran off with him There was no ransom demand Didn't you think it strange that you knew nothing about her private life? I don't spy on people... do you? Any idea who she'd run away with? No, but knowing Vanessa, it had to be someone... ...very special - In what way? - In every way Vanessa... Two years have gone by and I'm sure you've made a new life for yourself But wherever you are... ...your friends won't forget you Please, Vanessa... Come back, I love you - He was crying... - Bullshit! - Suppose he's honest - Don't fall for it You look at his angelic face and believe every word he says - Do you fancy him? - Don't be silly Don't you be silly But that letter... The letter just says she fell in love - Who with? - Who do you think? How can you so sure? And besides... ...Bosco has a girl Get this into your head Apart from being a stuck-up little turd, he is a psychopath... That's all he is Can't you see how he looks at you? He's dying to blow your brains out while he buggers you - He's mad! - Sounds like you know him Right, go for him. He'll come round with a camera and a knife - So what now? - Nothing Why? We know who he is, now let's go home We must tell the police Like hell we do! Not me, anyway... We've no proof. We don't even know where the old man got the tape From the library No way Anyone home? A friend of your's here. He's gorgeous Is Angela home? - She is, come on in - Thanks A bit on edge, aren't you? You know where I live? I do my own investigations So what do you want? I brought you the interview Thank you, there was no need That's not why I came Why then? I want to shoot you What? There are no shots of you interviewing me We need them for the editing Sure, I forgot Right, when you're ready Here? It's in close-up. You can't tell where we are You'll see Where's your room? I don't like being taped I don't believe that A pretty girl like you? Don't worry, it won't take long Had this camera long? Around... four months It's no longer on the market God, you do know everything I got it second-hand Why do you ask? No special reason You like asking questions, don't you? Can I ask you one? Go ahead What colour are my eyes? I don't know... I haven't really looked I see... so you're a liar as well How much longer? You're in a hurry? It's almost lunch You'll stay for lunch, Bosco? Love to Great, I'm nipping out for a few things Be good What are you doing? The light's bad for this camera. Sit on the bed Why? I can't get a good focus from here. Sit on the bed That's it Ready when you are We're talking to Bosco, a classmate of Vanessa... ...who was close to her prior to - Aren't you checking? It's one straight shot Look at me when you ask the questions Did she mix with wierd types? Do you think she was kidnapped? Any idea who she ran away with? That's it Hang on You need some nods as reaction to my answers For intercuts Wait... What? - We were closer yesterday - I don't think so Does it bother you? Say when it starts bothering you Don't! Every word brings me an inch closer It's not funny Don't speak Nervous? - Of course not - Not a word! The mouth can kill I'm not going to die "I'm-not-going-to-die" Five inches What colour are my eyes? Are you going to kill me? Six more inches for saying that Just one more word... ...and we collide I thought you wanted this Next time I'll punch your face There won't be a next time Angela, don't let Bosco set the table - Who switched channels? - I did, the news is boring How would you know? Where's the remote? So you work as well as study? I do some filming What kind? Whatever I get: weddings... - Baptisms... - Does it pay? Enough Angela never does such things She works hard on her thesis You're doing your thesis? I've just started On what? I'm not sure yet Audiovisual violence and the family You're into violence? Not really She loves it. She's warped. She spends hours analysing violent films Shut up, Sena Is this project part of your thesis? No, why? The last film she brought home was really something You're doing a project? What is it about? Shall we eat? We've talked enough What do you study? - I started law this year - Law? What do you know... I wanted to do law Really? So why didn't you? Don't know, I'm not cut out for it You've got to be very... Very tenacious... and very intelligent - I'm neither and I'm studying it - Your meat's getting cold You look it What? lntelligent... How's Yolanda? Who's Yolanda? His girlfriend We've broken up Really? More or less... the meat is excellent He's been to your house? Bloody hell! Why did you let him in? I can't help it, he charmed my family It's you he's charmed. With me, not even coffee, but him you invite home! Stop being silly! He says he bought it 4 months ago, second-hand That snotty sod using second-hand? He bought it new, with guarantee. He's got you again We can check You either believe him or me That's rubbish! Look, I've lost the receipt and the shop doesn't have it either but... - They said you'd have it - What was it? A XT-500 camera You must have bought it... Two years ago The guarantee's expired I know, but I need to keep the receipts Alright... 1 993... - You live in Madrid? - Yes Your name? It's my brother's - Bosco Herranz He must come himself They said it's not necessary on the phone Who told you? Some girl, I think One moment, please "Customer:" "Customer unknown" "ltem:" I knew it! Freddy Kruger himself Haven't seen you for a while I've been busy - Jerking off? - Less than you Can I look at the closed-circuit tapes? You want me to get the sack? The 1 2th, the library Slow down What do I get? My body No, thanks High-class porn How did you get in? What do you want? Don't you know? To kill you The phone Someone called Castro - I hope I didn't wake you up - Not at all I'd like to discuss your thesis How about 1 1 today, in my office - Fine... - Great I'll see you later then Is Angela there? No, she's out Come in - How are you? - Fine... Have a seat Cigarette? I don't smoke, thanks Right, let's see... It's somewhere here... I'm hopeless Here it is Let's see... Why are you interested in violence? We get so much of it in films, on TV, that we're getting too used to it So? I'm concerned Why? Because I don't like violence You reject it? Of course Always? Yet violence is something that is innate in us all We can't censor every film But the director must be aware of its impact The director's only duty is to give the public what it wants That's the basic principle of all entertainment Do you reject show-business? - No, but... - It's a very complex issue For example... On what type of violence... ...will you focus? How do you mean? Any particular genre? I got the impression - and correct me if I'm wrong... I find that your approach is rather... - Superficial? - Yes You should get in deeper This is meant to be a research project These are just notes, it's not final So you're investigating? lnvestigating what? I don't know... it's for you to tell me Tell you what? What you're investigating I didn't say I was, you did Alright Since you seem reluctant to collaborate... I don't get it I'll tell you... try a different angle What killed Figueroa? Why ask me? He was your supervisor. You must know what killed him You said it was an asthma attack He was quite old What was in the screening room... What was it he saw that could have killed him Any idea? You like theories... don't you have one? No, I don't Look, Angela... I think you're an intelligent girl I'm sure you'll go far That's why I don't understand you... I don't understand you Really? You don't understand me? I think you do Think whatever you like. I think I've heard enough You know something? So have l I hate such situations. It's humiliating to be caught lying... Like this, especially Don't you agree? It makes you wonder: why do people lie? Why are you lying? What's on that tape You've lost your voice Very well... I want that tape in my office, tomorrow Agreed? Now tell me Why did you take it? - Is Angela there? - No, who is it? Where is she? She had a meeting with some professor Who? Angela, I can't supervise a student who steals, lies... ...and, worst of all... ...who doesn't trust me. So, for the last time, why did you take it? I don't know - Where did you get it? - I don't know Was it yours? You wanted it back? - So why take it? - I don't know I'm getting tired of this No professor here will take up your thesis if you're not straight with them It has nothing to do with my thesis It's far more serious I'm all ears No one else knows this What? It's for you You can take in there Angela, it's Chema. What are you doing there? - Get out, now! That guy's in it - How do you know? - He knows about the tape? - He knows I took it So he knows everything. He'll want it Find some excuse and get out! - I've got to go... - Do you? I'll see you... Shouldn't we finish... - It's my thesis, my degree? - It's your life! - I tried to get you all day yesterday - I called you too - He'll be after me now - He's one of them - I thought it was just Bosco - You were wrong - How many are there? - No idea, but Castro is one of them - How do you know? - How did he know you had the tape? Because he saw me on the closed-circuit camera Yes, and another camera taped him - That's Figueroa - Wait... Where was he? Around the corner He found out everything, including the tape What's in that corner? An underground store-room where they hide things What things? I've taken some Vanessa wasn't the only victim It's not an isolated incident. It's a business Torture, murders... It's all down there The cameras must be there too What cameras? 13 XT-500, bought by the faculty two years ago, for practice Do you know what it means? To begin with, Bosco's not involved Again? Why do you defend him? There are 1 3 cameras. Any student could have filmed it - No student made this film! - How do you know? Because I - I did projects with those cameras What? Before they were scrapped Why didn't you tell me? I'm telling you now It's nothing to do with this Those cameras are just gathering dust somewhere They're gone. Nobody knows where they are Great - They must be down there - There are only tapes - We must find them - I was there, there's nothing - Tonight, Chema! - Shit, no! Listen to me, just once You're doing it for him You're in love with him, idiot Tonight, idiot! What do you want? To talk to you About? Vanessa was killed We all had nothing but lectures... ...so Vanessa and I joined a directors' workshop, Bosco too We did some practice with cameras - What type? - I don't know, I don't remember One guy took the whole thing very seriously He was always telling us what to do Then Bosco and that other guy became friends They started working together They asked one girl to act for them She had to take off her clothes and... Well, I left them to it Why? It was awful And the professor said nothing? - Who was it? - Jorge Castro Do you know him? It got worse Towards the end of the year... ...Bosco's friend told us about Snuff. Do you know what it is? They choose some person... ...kidnap, torture, kill them and record it all on tape or film No editing, no effects, no make-up All in one sequence shot That guy was obsessed with Snuff Vanessa and I got scared... He said it was very easy to make such stuff I told Bosco we should pull out And? They stopped seeing each other. I don't know why The workshop closed And a week later, Vanessa disappeared They said she ran away from home But she'd have told me I'm sure that guy killed her He used her in a snuff film And the letter? They sent it after she disappeared. She was probably forced to write it And that guy? Your friend, with the glasses I've seen you with him There are more. Do you watch TV? More cases like Vanessa's Five girls in two years "The police suspects... "...a video Snuff network." No other clear motive No bodies Have you told Bosco? We hardly talk nowaday Besides, he won't believe me Chema wouldn't do it You never know - I know him - So do l And I know it's him - You don't believe me? - You said it And this? Is that also a lie? The best woman in the world found her other half She wore the trousers, he gave the blows You had many lovers, none of them are alive today They died, crushed under, while they were making love There are times... We can go You knew Bosco before Did you? Did you know him? Great! Thanks for telling me now You told him about Snuff So? Making snuff movies is something else Why look for Vanessa's friends? You know who they are I hardly knew Vanessa or her friends I only knew Bosco Why did you fall out? - I didn't trust him - Oh, really? He looks sweet but he's a bastard So are you, you lied to me... ...you said you weren't involved So you wouldn't associate me with Bosco! I didn't want to scare you. I didn't want you to think that l... And you care what I think? You're right, think what you like - Suppose I think that... - What? Nothing, forget it What about the cameras? I know the security guy Now what? It's somewhere here This way These tunnels lead to the old boilers. No one's been down here in years This way See? Only tapes Figueroa took the first one he saw How many are there? About 200 Must be good business What are you doing? Looking for the cameras Shit! - What is it? - The masters - Worth a fortune - You mean, the originals? - No, but they must be here - Chema, don't waste time The unedited originals: that's our evidence They must have destroyed them What was that? - It's closed from outside - I don't believe it! It may be worse Worse? - We've been locked in! - Chema, where are you? - Beside you, you're choking me! - What's going on? - God knows. Do you smoke? - No... - Shit, we need a lighter! - I have matches - Do you really? - I think so You're panting... like a dog Give me the matches It's half empty... good! We've got to move, they mustn't find us There... over there, look! Someone's watching us It's our shadows... it's just our shadows! You disappoint me - I'm scared - So am l... ...but that won't get us out - What's happened? - The match's gone out Chema, hold me - What? - Someone touched me! You told me to hold you! Don't leave me Why are you so quiet? Why don't you talk? - What can I say? - I don't know Tell me who you are, what do you do? I'm Chema, I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm Chema Hi, I'm Chema You're squeezing my arm too tight I'm sorry I'll tell you a story... A children story Once upon a time, there was a princess who lived in a palace And? This way... When she was thirteen... ...they gave a great ball for her, with clowns, jugglers, acrobats... But the princess was bored Then an ugly dwarf appeared... He danced, he did pirouettes... "Please keep dancing", said the princess But the dwarf was too tired, so the sad princess retired to her chamber The dwarf was sure she would go and live with him in the wood "She's not happy here", he thought "I'll look after her, I'll make her laugh" So the dwarf searched the palace for the princess' room But in one of the rooms he saw something terrible A monster with eyes which were bloody and crossed... ...with hairy hands and huge feet When he realised he was seeing himself in the mirror, he almost died At that moment, the princess walked in "You're back, how nice! Will you dance with me again?" But the dwarf was lying, lifeless, on the floor The court doctor checked his pulse "He won't dance with you again, Princess" "Why?" she asked. "Because his heart is broken" And the Princess said: "From now on... "...no one with a heart may enter this palace" Here the story ends and the match bends There's no way to tell which way to go - There must be another exit - So what? We can't see a bloody thing Chema, bring the matrch here What is it? - What now? - Burn it! Go on! Shit! It's the editing room Look! I told you These must be the scrapped ones Maybe, but Bosco's camera might be one of these I'm cold Do you want my coat? No, thanks Good... How many matches left? Shit! What now? I don't know Take something else off - Why don't you? - OK, so it was a daft idea Are they going to kill us? Oh, yes What are we going to do? Shit, it's going out Never mind I can't see your face. I can't tell if it's you or someone else Five... Four, three, two... - It's not funny - One... Good-bye, Princess I'm freezing You can hug me, if you like I like Go on, then Chema? Don't look at the track! What colour are my eyes? You've fallen in love with him, idiot! Why did Figueroa die? "Because his heart is broken"... The police knows everything You've lied to me before You killed Vanessa and the others I've never killed anyone I only edit the films - Have you seen them? - They're filth You give the public what it wants It's just the beginning Who killed them then? I'll tell you if you tell me who phoned you this morning You know what's going to happen now That person won't be coming I don't know where he is You're lucky, because I won't make you suffer lt'll be painless Now, please... For your own good... Don't move your head His name is Jorge Castro He's pointing a gun at me Very well... Don't move My name is Angela, I'm going to be killed Exactly He's dead You wanted to see a killing, right? Wanted to see a killing?
