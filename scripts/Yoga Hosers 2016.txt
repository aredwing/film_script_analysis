Not, not, not, not-not Woo! Yeah. Look at his cute little nipples. Oh, my god, Ichabod, cover up. You know, I don't have to come and beat the skins for you two Beliebers. - Shut up. - Yeah. You know we love you, Icha-wad. Remember when he ripped off his shirt before and we saw his yummy Icha-bod? I nearly wrote a whole blog about it, girl, hasthtag Ichagod. - You did? - I did not. Not, not, not-not No. - Shit. - No, what's that noise? Oh, no, do you two uncompromising rebel riot girls actually have to go back to work? - Shut up, Icha-bodily functions. - Yeah. Excuse me, Condescending Riot Girls. Uh, we'll take two packs of smokes, gimme a bag of milk, and why don't you throw in the best most exciting years of your life stuck behind a counter, eh? You're a dick, Ichabod. Oh, that's mean. I call you Dickabod. I can't believe it took you this long to think of Dickabod! Sorry aboot that. Sorry aboot that. Sorry aboot that. Sorry aboot that. Sorry aboot that. Now, that was a lot longer than 10 minutes. My best friend was having lady problems in the bathroom, okay? May I shop? Sure. Sir Pedophile-in-Denial. So I'll see you guys Friday, eh? I said, eh? Wunderbar Hi. Um, True Norths, this week's issue of Them, and his Pucky Charms. And, um... Condoms. Oh, my god, this is about you two. Yes, ma'am, and we hate it. It says here that you saved a man's life. But it's, like, dumb because the guy was a walrus - and not a manatee. - There's a big difference. Yeah, a walrus has tusks and manatees don't. Did you know they called the manatee a sea cow? Moo, I'm utterly underwater, eh? Moo, moo, eh? That's her underwater cow, it's hysterical. That is funny. C'mon, Wayne. Moo, moo, moo. I'm a loser, eh? Okay, that kid rules. More of that, less of everything else ever. Hunter Calloway's here, Hunter Calloway's here! Oh, my god, could you stop being so basic? Oh, I gotta Gram the shit outta this. The little Colleen Coalition. The only sassy, sexy... sophomores in Honors history rockin' the smocks. Where's the Pepto Bismol? Ew, it's over there. Sorry aboot that, he's such a sitcom. Yeah, well, we close in 20 minutes, so if he pukes, you're cleaning it up. Let me ask you somethin', you ladies like workin' the Zed? - Not at all. - Customers make it suck. Yeah, you know what wouldn't suck? Colleen and Colleen with me in between. The very definition of suck. Are the Colleen's, perchance, working tomorrow? Not on a Friday night, no way. We're off, why? I would like to invite you both to my party. A senior party? A neenior nardy? Now with two very cool sophomores. May I have the honor of your number, mademoiselle? Who's there? Come out, come out, wherever you are. - Wunderbar. Oh, oh. Get out of my bum! A grade 12 party with boys? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not aboot to let you go to a grade 12 party with boys, Colleen. It's just a grade 12 party, it's not the Nazi Party. Senior boys only invite sophomore girls to parties for one thing. Well, me and Colleen don't do that. And even if we did, we have our periods this week. No, you don't, little liar. We're always in-sync and I don't get mine for two more weeks. Holy shit, you still get your period Ms. McKenzie? Please, you have to let me go to this party. It's only the most important night of my entire life. No way. Just the thought of going to a grade 12 party has you lying to me about your menstrual cycle. And you know a woman's menstrual cycle is sacred, Colleen. I'm talking aboot the period blood of women. Please, just let me go, Mom. I promise won't sellout on my gender ever again. On one condition, you bring something stabby. They get cute, they get cut. Holy shit. I call her The Mohel, she's my date knife. Thanks. So we start with Pretentious Frog. Pretentious Frog, "I only eat grass-fed flies." The Dissatisfied Customer. Dissatisfied Customer. "I don't like the product you've given me." Atlas Shrugged, Atlas Shrugged. We've got Atlas and then we shrug. Do Lasers from the Wrists, Lasers from the Wrists. Yoga Fett, Yoga Fett. Awkward Conversationalist, we put our foot in a mouth. Foot in the mouth. Upward Dog, our favorite canine. Downward Dog. Here we go Three-Legged Dog. That's sad, Three-Legged Dog, look at that dog. But you know what's sadder? Two-Legged Dog, and he's in his little pushcart, his little makeshift wheelbarrow and he's pushing himself along. We push right into Lotus Position. And we feel positive energy all around us. And let's hold onto that positive energy in the room. But, you know, I did read on the message boards at CanadianCorpses.com that they've been finding body parts all over Winnipeg for the last few months. Body parts? Oh, yeah, arms, legs, heads, scalps, torsos, feet, hands, nipples, dinkies. Dinkies? I said, "Take my dinky first, but leave me my nipples." It's basically a vestigial dinky at this point. But you take my nipples, and that's my identity. There's some real negativity in the world, girls. But remember, negative space can still be a design asset, as long as you live the Yoga Way. And you breathe the Yoga Way. And. yes, you even have to shit the Yoga Way. Seriously. sit in Lotus Position next time you're on the toilet, everything just falls out of you. Like you're dumping a book bag. A book bag full of poo. Go. Okay. let me see. That one's cute. that one's cute, don't post that one though. Okay. yeah, you look basic. Oh. what in the ham and eggs is this all about? It looks like a Vancouver Hockey Riot in here. What'd you do. rob a mall? - Hi. Dad. - Hi, Mr. Collette. What are you doin' with all these clothes? - We're screening outfits. - Oh. yeah? Whatever gets the most likes. we wear to the party tomorrow night. A grade 12 party. No! A grade 12 party already eh? Oh. where did my little girl go? Aw. stop. You two are gonna make me cry. - I'm back. - Hey. hey! That's gonna make me cry. - Hey. Hey. - Hey. Hey. - A little tongue - I bit ya. eh? I got a bite! Oh. my god. It looks like a Vancouver Hockey Riot in here. I know. I know. What is this. What are you two doing? They're picking out their outfits for a party tomorrow. A grade 12 party. Oh. - Big time. big time. - Oh. with seniors now. I know. She's only supposed to go to sophomore mixers. I thought. Yeah. right. C'mon. Tabs, we all know you can't think. Mm-hmm. Okay. okay. When I went to count out the register tonight. The back room was a mess. Yeah? Colleen. Okay. they can't be practicing in the back of the store anymore. Bob. Last year. they blew out the power with their amps. Yeah. it's bad enough the two of them are always with their faces in their phones behind the counter. Such pretty faces too. Pretty faces. Lock up the store and go play their so-called music in the backroom with that pederast loser. - He's not a loser. - God knows what else. eh? That's disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. And. like. who are we? You? Skeezing on losers is your superpower. This isn't skeezing. okay? I fell in love with your father. After he made you manager. And as manager. You know what I've noticed? Where'd all the beaver stuffies go? Not the beavers! Oh yeah. - No. that's a big seller. - Yeah. yeah. They didn't sell 'em. I checked the receipts. She checked She checked the receipts. Where'd all my beavers go? Frankly. Tabitha. I don't give a damn about your beavers. Goddamned yoga hosers. Where's little Miss Wo-Manager going? We're just gonna go in our room and we're gonna I'm gonna we're just gonna go watch a movie. - Okay? - Oh can you just do me a favor? Can you just leave the door open. though? Love you. Dad. Close the door. Bob. All the way. Bob. She told me not to. God. she's the daughter. Bob, not the parent. You're in charge. not her. What do you want me to do. eh'? That's my little girl. That's my little girl. I'm your little girl. Bob. Bob. do you wanna ride the Ferris Wheel. Bob? Don't talk about the Ferris Wheel. don't talk about Wanna go for a ride on the Ferris Wheel? I don't wanna Oh! You wanna jump in the bouncy house? You'll let me jump in the bouncy house? Twice. - Oh. my god. - What. you finished already? Oh. come on. I'm sorry. sorry. What is she playing? Babe I'm leavin' I must be on my way - The time is drawing near. I used to sing this to her when she was a baby. - My train is going - I see it in your eyes. The love. the need, your tears. She she just remembers it. But I'll be lonely without you And I'll need your love to see me through. She's just growing up so fast. You know? So please believe me my heart is in your hands. Cause' I'll be missing you. You know it's you Babe. Whenever I get weary and I've had enough. Feel like giving up. - - You know it's you Babe. Giving me the courage and the strength I need. Please believe That it's true. Babe I love you. Goddamned yoga hosers. You know it's you Babe. Whenever I get weary and I've had enough. Feel like giving up. You know it's you Babe. Giving me the courage and the strength I need. Please believe that it's true. Babe I love you. Babe I love you. Oooh... Babe. Ladies. Up Dog. One. two. three. What a farce. I can't believe they actually have the balls - to try to call this Yoga. - I know. How are ya. girls? Ms. Wicklund. You photo bombed us. Way hip. Ms. Wick. What makes you two think that you can sit out of my yoga class this morning? This isn't yoga. This is like a parody of yoga. And our yoga instructor gave us this note to give to you. Ms. Wicklund. We have permission to sit oot anytime you do yoga here in Phys Ed because he doesn't want his teachings derailed by what he calls. "The abortion of Phys Ed Yoga." Well far be it me to argue with a strip-mall swami. Uh. technically he's a yogi. Right? Technically. There's a school honor policy aboot camera phones in PE. There is? Do any of you ladies want to be photographed by these two while you're all sweatin' like hogs? - No. - I didn't think so. Is she talking aboot us'? No. she's talking aboot the other two Colleens behind us. I'm talkin' aboot you're entire generation. Generation Why Me? I call it. You live on your phones. You have no idea how to function like normal people in the real world. Ms. Wicklund. This isn't the real world. This is Canada. Oh. is that right. eh'? Well. how about you save your Can-bashin' sass for your tweets. And your Facebookins'. And try clickin' like on this. Girls. No phones for the rest of the day! What? You can get 'em back at 2:45. After the last bell. Ms. Wicklund. Our phones are who we are. If you take away my phone like I'm some sort of pygmy in Monaco. - Who am I supposed to be? - I feel like I'm going to pass oot. And now Colleen M.'s having hot flashes. You're on a new phone plan now. girls. Unlimited minutes. unlimited looks to the world around you. And no roaming charges. So go roam. Withoot your phones! Here I go. Are you happy. Ms. Wicklund? You killed Colleen. - The gym floor was really hard. - I know. it's okay. Greetings. Cess-bearing scholars. Are you ready to go deep inside the annals of history? We're still talking aboot World War ll. Fascists. Genocide. The worst thing that has ever happened to human kind. Why do we even gotta learn about this old stuff anyway. Ms. Maurice? I mean. it happened. like. A million miles away, like a million years ago. Mon dieu? You all think history is so boring. Well. what if I told you. During World War ll. There were Nazis right here. In Winnipeg? All of them making preparation for the day Hitler finally came to conquer Canada and the United States. There were Nazis here in Canada. Ms. Maurice? Let's see. what can I tell you about Canadian Nazis? Well. many years back in the 1930's there was a great depression in the True North. Canadians were hungry. Some turned their hunger into anger. And they looked for someone else to blame for the country's financial woes. And as a result. in Toronto. The first Swastika Club opens. A pub full of drunks. Offering up anti-Semitic rabble aboot deporting Canadian Jews to the Hudson Bay. Wait. they wanted to send them shopping? Not to the Hudson Bay department store. Ms. Collette. I'm talkin' aboot the actual Hudson Bay. Like. Put them all oot in the water'? That's just so wrong. The Canadian Union of Fascists was founded right here. In Winnipeg by a Manitoban. And over in Quebec. you had the big kahuna of crazy himself. The nuttiest of all nut bars. Adrien Arcand. The self-proclaimed Canadian fuhrer. So. this Arcand guy was. Like. Canadian Hitler? Is that as bad as. Like. Canadian Idol? - Nothing's as bad as Canadian Idol. - Right? Let me take you back to a time in Canadian History this nation has tried so very hard to forget. In this trying time... Adrien Arcand was an anti-Semitic journalist in Montreal who spearheaded a series of fascist political movements in Quebec before the start of World War ll. Why are you hungry? Why are you unemployed? Is it. as our ally in Germany. Adolf Hitler. tells us, the fault of the Canadian Jew? Yes. it is! Now Henry Hamilton Beamish suggests that to save Canada from ethnic ruin. We must send all Canadian Jews to Madagascar. Instead. we at the Parti National have a better plan. First. we will round up all Canadian Jews and ship them off to the Hudson Bay. Then we will fire cannons at their boats and sink them! Why are you not applauding? Naturally. These atrocious ideas were met with derisions from the good and mighty people of Quebec. This plan is the shit! But not everyone in attendance that day was from Quebec. Wunderbar! Wunderbar! Andronicus Arcane was a brilliant scientist from Berlin who was teaching at the University of Lachute in Quebec when he first heard the clarion call of the Nazi Party. So. Adrien Arcand took Andronicus Arcane under his wing. And soon there were more. These jackbooted thugs would torment immigrants and minorities throughout Montreal. They called themselves the National Unity Party of Canada. Which was a very polite way of saying Canadian Nazis. So what ever happened to these guys. Ms. Maurice? They ever get caught? In 1940 the Service de Quebec arrested Adrien Arcand. And under the War Measures Act. Arcand was locked up as a security threat to our home and native land. He died in 1967 still believing Hitler would rise again. But what aboot the man from Berlin? Oh. Yeah. What aboot him? Andronicus Arcane? He was never found. Poof! He just disappeared. Poof? Perfect timing class dismissed. How basic. Straight from the Eh-to-Zed it's the Mountie McBeaver Doll. Oh. Where did all my beaver stuffies go? Well. frankly Tabitha. I don't give a damn about your beavers. Are you doing me'? - That's hysterical. - I know. C'mon. Isn't anybody on duty? Who's dropping a doodie in my office? Oh! What a nice surprise. It's Lulu and Lemon. Good afternoon Principle Invincible. Good afternoon. Colleen squared. We're here for our phones. We haven't had them since PE. Ms. Wicklund unjustly confiscated them. And Colleen here fainted. - I passed oot. - Oh! We're not pressing charges or anything. We're not going crazy. We just want our phones back now. please. Oh. Of course girls. And I am so. so sorry that that happened to you. The sad tale of heart-wrenching woe. I mean. it could win an Oscar. Really. you could write it up, sell it, and win an Oscar. Seriously. you could call it. Um. Twelve Years a Private School Student. You see what I did there? I compared your privileged lives to slaves. And that's weird. 'Cause I'm black. That's not funny. Sorry. Principle Invincible. Here. And keep your faces out of your phones. I don't care if they do have a cool gummy rubber cover that you can personalize. - We have the same case! - I know. Very trendy. my friendy. Oh. Ladies. I am an educator. It is my job to shape the minds of the young and the stupid. So I need to be able to think. Like the young and the stupid. Which means I'm not gonna let my students be cooler than me. I do my research. I read this rag. weekly. Oh my god. We read that every week. Oh. I know. The "Famous People Are Just Like You" page is the best. You know. when they, like, show the celebrities doing normal things. Like. just like us. That is the best part of Them Weekly. One time they showed Harry Styles buying bacon. - It was so hot. - So hot. Okay. all right. I need to run this school. Be good Colleens. And be nice, all right'? There's enough haters in the world already. Yes. Principle Invincible. Oh my god. my phone's dead, my phone's dead! Oh my god! My phone's dead! Children should not play with dead things. Bonjour. My name is Guy Lapointe. Righty-oh. So the good news is your school library does indeed have a copy of my book. Guy Lapointe and the Quite Queer Case of the Manitoba Manatee. The bad news is. regrettably. Some naughty student has decided to deface it by changing the word "Guy" and adding in "A" so that it says "Gay". And also. They added a set of testicles right under my nose. You see that? You see that? With that kind of. You know, awful poking hair, I don't know why. Sticking out of them. You can put it down now. Oh. Okay. Haters have got to hate. Like the douches have to douche. That's the life. Right there in a nutshell. I'm not referring to that nutshell either. I don't know if you guys remember this. But you know we did meet once before. Do you? - Oh. We remember you. - You do? Yeah. you came to Eh-2-Zed with that American girl and that podcaster. Yeah. You're the legendary man hunter from Quebec. Yes. I am that man. The man who saved the Winnipeg Walrus. Wow. you know something? That's a very good title. Guy Lapointe and the Winnipeg Walrus. Goddammit. I should've chose that title. But. you know, still, we did okay without it. I mean... One critic even described my book as. like. You know. like a uh, John Grisham-ist thriller who was set in the Canada. That review I showed to my mother. - Aw. - Mm. And you know, that was. like, the good one, and the rest of them were not so kind. you see. I read one from the Toronto Paper that said. "This is what happens when you publish poop." People can be goddamn mean. You know? Sorry. That was very rude. Sorry aboot that. Right. on to my questions then. Do either of you recognize this very proud and quite hairy Canadian? That was that giant fart that called us yoga hosers. - Oh. Toilet Paper Man. - Yeah. Why Toilet Paper Man? Cause he bought toilet paper. - He bought toilet paper. - Duh. And for this reason alone you call this man the Toilet Paper Man? - Well. yeah. - Yeah. I don't mean to be a critic. Maybe I do. Maybe you need to be hurt. I'm telling you now. that is one of the stupidest names I ever heard in my life. Very unimaginative. - That's pretty rude. - Yeah. This man's name is the Francois Jois. He's from Gatineau. Quebec. And he was a fugitive from the law. and he was hiding out right here. Hiding from what? He was hiding from the investigating prowess of the Service de Quebec. Which is kind of a joke. Because. like, they couldn't find their own butt holes even with. like, a butt hole application on their telephone to find their butt hole. Okay. I probably shouldn't say butt hole to two 14-year-old girls. I'm so sorry. We're 15 and a half. Well. whatever. You sold a roll of Eh-2-Zed discount brand bathroom tissue to the Toilet Paper Man at what time? Right aboot closing. Yeah. he was all mad because we had the store closed for. like, five minutes 'cause we were going to the bathroom. You went to the bathroom together? Well. yeah. I had to poop and I don't like to go alone there. The toilet's weird. So while she's pooping. You're sitting there with her? Yeah. we're best friends. Yeah. Why would we not'? That's quite disgusting. Best of luck on your academic journey. Um. I don't know what you plan to do in life. But I can promise you that you won't need algebra. I knew it. Good day. Well. wait. What'd Toilet Paper Man do? Oh. So. Toilet Paper Man was killed. Oh my god. He was cut into. Like. a hundred pieces. Ew. no way. Well anyway. you two girls with the same name, I thank you so much for your time. And I give you the Au Revoir that I should have given you before. I thank you. Okay. Ew. Why did your dad text me. like, 37 times? Oh my god. He's making us work tonight. You're going to Niagara Falls? Yup. Cruising like a couple of Californians. How bout that? - Right now? - Yeah. You can't leave. It's Niagara Falls. Colleen. We're settin' sail on the Maid of the Mist. When did this happen? Oh. Tabitha surprised me with it as an early birthday present this morning. Tabitha. Okay. you listen to me. I left you 10 messages and a bushel of texts. I'm sorry. but you gotta work at the store tonight. We can't. actually. Yes. you can. Colleen M., 'cause I cleared it with your mom and you're going to be staying with the McKenzies until Sunday morning. Mr. Collette. we got invited to a grade 12 party tonight. Do you not remember? All I remember is Tabitha telling me somethin' about flying to Niagara Falls. and after that it is a blur of bliss. So happy. Bob. I'll get that for ya. I love the leopard print. I love the leopard print. Okay girls. you're gonna be working from six pm until closing and don't forget to set the alarm before you lock up. okay? You did this on purpose. Didn't you? You could have taken him any day. but you picked today. Just so we couldn't go to the party. I have no idea what you're talking aboot. Colleen. Goddamned yoga hosers. I love you so much. Cauliflower. I love you so much. Listen. no boys. no boys. No bull, no boys, no boys. - Okay. I gotta go. - Dad. Dad! - Dad. Dad! You can't leave. - Come on. please. - Dad. we have... No! Oh. my god! No. no. no. no, no. Oh. you are killing me, do you understand me'? Killing me! Bark all you want. Lawyer pants USA. I am not ceasing or desisting. Oh. ls that so? Well. I think you're being rather obtuse and super fruity. So let's just say Namaste. And leave it at that. eh? Namaste. You piece of beaver shit. Beaver shit? Sorry. girls. I am so sorry you girls had to hear that parasite stealing my energies. With his legal entitlement. Why does that lawyer from Warner Brothers even keep calling you Yogi Bayer'? Oh. who knows? He says there's some cartoon character that I'm violating. I mean. how can you violate a cartoon? How do you own a cartoon. right'? Yeah. It's like a thing that doesn't exist. It's like owning a leprechaun. Rude. So rude. Okay. let's get back into it. Enough Sasketoonin'. Let's get back into our Warrior One. Up to Perfection. Colleen C.. Hold that pose Colleen M.. Hold it. Warrior Two. Come and get me now. You serenity stealers. All you need to handle any situation in life. Are the Warrior One and Warrior Two positions. girls. Okay? Master those and you will master anyone who gives you shit. Now let's go Lotus for our closing meditation. Yoga teaches us to take what the universe gives. And what? - Embrace it? - Nope. Fight against it. You fight against it. Yoga demands that we grab the universe by the throat and we just choke it until it bends to our will. We inflict yoga on our enemies until they join us in peace. Always be peaceful change girls. But if you have to. you destroy everything that threatens anyone or anything that you love by hook or by crook. That's the yoga way. Wow. Please join me in a final prayer. Yoga Fett. Yoga Fett. Yoga Fett. Yoga Fett. Yoga Fett. Yoga Fett. Yoga Fett. And sorry not sorry. Confetti feel. Caller. go ahead. Oh. hey Bob, big fan and a first time caller... Hey. pack of True North Menthol. Those are lights. Sorry aboot that. You know girls. That's just not very Canadian. C'mon Robin. Let's get out of here. When is one's virginity technically lost'? Like when what is the process when you're going through the sex process of losing virginity. That process? How can one come out at the end and then say like... - Hunter's calling. - So answer. Hello? Colleen McKenzie! Hunter. Where you at? You're missing a killer grade 12 party over here. Please don't hate us. but we got called into work tonight. That sucks. Yeah. it really sucks. Because there's like. Nobody here tonight either. Holy shit. What? We could have a party right here. Hunter. Hello. This is Colleen C. We unfortunately cannot make it to your party tonight but we want to invite you to another party... At Eh-2-Zed. Hold on. this shit's loud, let me go in the bedroom so I can hear. Ah ha. sweet. Sweet dude. You want me to bring the party to you guys? Won't your dad flip if we're drinkin' beers in the 'Zed? Oh. don't you worry aboot that. My dad's long gone in Niagara Falls with the store manager. And bring beers. We don't have any booze here. Did you say boobs? Booze-uh. Booze-uh. What time should we head to the Zed? Nine o'clock? Perfect. We'll be there. And I can't wait... to see you. Colleen M. Show you what I'm really all aboot. What the hell was that? Here we go. Going to the Zed again is so stupid. Sorry. Now. follow me on this. Gordon. These girls just gift-wrapped themselves for us. We were gonna have to dig shallow graves after we cut 'em up. Now we're goin' to their store. We kill 'em in the store. Shit, we can take our time, do it right. We can leave their bodies right between the Pucky Charms and the Chug-a-lugs. And all we gotta do is take the money from the register. Break some shit on the way oot... And make it look like a failed robbery gone bad. eh? These stupid sophomore bitches want to have a party at the Zed? We'll give 'em a party at the Zed. Their farewell party. yo. Where should I kiss Hunter tonight? Ew. lips only. I mean. in the store? Keep it tasteful. McKenzie. Don't whore him on the first date. Casual. not contrived. You give the best advice. You're my best friend in the whole world. Aw. you're mine. Hear that? That's our destiny knocking at the backdoor. Hi. Ladies. we are here to cordially accept your invitation to party hardy. We? Party. yeah! What's he doing here? And where's everybody else? Hmm. where's everybody else? Well. when I made the other seniors the same very generous offer you made me to move the party here. Yeah. they all laughed at you. Tonya Simmons said. and I quote. "A party at the scummy Eh-2-Zed with those two little girls from honors history? No way. eh?" "I'd rather kiss Gordon Greenleaf." I'd rather kiss... She didn't say that. man. She was thinkin' it. Anyways. I've never been much of a follower. So I left all those losers behind and came here to hang with you two. You left your own party? Parties are basic. This is better. This is what they call in the states. a kickback. States. Eh? And. I brought Gordon so Colleen C. would have someone to talk to while little Miss Colleen M. gives me a private tour. Looks like it's just us. eh? Maybe we should form the Just Us League? A little kickback hookup. Yeah... heh. So this is the Eh-2-Zed backroom. again. Epic. Colleen and I call it the Highway to Hell. 'Cause Eh-2-Zed's right through that door. And Eh-2-Zed's pretty much our hell. Highway to Hell? Mm-Hmm. Wow. Devil talk always gives me goosebumps. Oh? See See Yeah. You believe in Satan? I used to believe in Santa. Does that count? So basic. Mmmmm. Me and Gordon are way into Satan. Ooh. Kind of like how you and Colleen are way into yoga. Or your band'? Yeah. Now. the good news is that we're Canadian Satanists. So we don't go in for any of that touchy stuff. Your virtue stays intact. It's gotta. You know why? Why? You see. Satan seeks his souls pure. And there are no virgins in grade 12. - Mm-hmm. - All the virgins are in grade 10. Well. I've just been waiting for the right person. In the right place. You are so adorable. McKenzie. You think I want your body? I don't want your body. I just want your untouched. Virgin soul. Okay. But. well, the shit sandwich of it all, I kinda gotta cut you open to get to it. Oh. You know. I'll be right back. Just one sec. Colleen! I thank you for your sacrifice. Colleen M. Every pure soul I give to Satan brings me one step closer to meeting the beast and that's gonna be so metal. What the hell's that? That's my mom's date knife pointed at your balls. Okay. Is that enough metal for you. Or do you want more? Oh. no. no. no, no. Can we talk aboot this? Talk to The Mohel. Okay. okay. Put the knife down. pretty boy. Okay. knife's down. I guess I got a little carried away there. Sorry aboot that. And I was gonna let you get to second base. There's something inside of me. - Are you okay? - Help me. Oh my god! Wunderbar! Colleen? Colleen? Here we go. Colleen? Colleen? McKenzie? Gordon. please. Stop begging. okay? You are not getting any. My ass. Gordon. I swear to God. If you puke. you're cleaning it up. Somethin' just crawled up in my ass! Is this what happens when you smoke weed? Oh no! Oh my god. Uh. Colleen? Wunderbar! Hey.

Security lights. 911. eh? Hello? We're being attacked by little sausage men. With concentrated sauerkraut for blood. That look like Adolf Hitler. Go. Oh. Hitler. eh? Well. he sure is a nasty camper. Worse than Dr. Doom and Darth Vader combined. Yeah. boy. Shut up. old man. Send a bunch of cops to the Eh-2-Zed on Portage and Wayne - and bring some body bags. - Little ones. Hurry! Hello? Hello? Goddamned yoga hosers. Wunderbar. Man. We've got wieners. Check over there. Wunderbar! Seriously? Sausage party. I don't wanna die in Canada! We're not gonna die in Canada. - There's no other way oot! - There's always another way. The Yoga Way. - The Yoga Way? - The Yoga Way. Okay. Warrior One. - Hold it. McKenzie. Hold it. - Okay.

Hands up. Don't you move. You goddamn yoga hosers! RCMP. freeze. This is so basic. This is beyond basic. - So basic. - Shh. Stop it. I'm itchy. Stop it. All right. C'mon. c'mon, c'mon. All right. You got aboot ten minutes before the RCMP come back. I'll try to stall 'em as long as I can. You know. thank you very much for doing this. I cannot know how to repay you for this. No. No. Thank you. Look. this book, is my bible. And you're like a goddamn Canadian Batman. Eh? Oh. That is so touching. I cannot believe. I'll stall for a second. Um. I thought that maybe you might need a stiff drink. You saw my mom? Where is she? Well. she's out there and she's trying to post bail. You know. Your father. who's name I think is Bob Collette. They are having a heck of a time getting in touch with that man. He's in Niagara Falls. The RCMP will not let your mommy bail you out of here because the RCMP don't ever let. Eh. serial killers out on bail. And they're saying that you are both the serial killers because you killeded those... Those eh. two boys, you know. You killed the absolute shit out of them. But we didn't kill the boys. We didn't kill anybody. They were gonna kill us. - They were devil worshipers. - Yeah. I don't really know much about the devil. but there we go. Somebody sure put their poop-holes through hell. You know? We didn't do this. Who did then? It was the Bratzis. Bratzis? I want to know what this Bratzi is. What is a Bratzi? It's like a foot-tall Canadian Nazi and it's made of Bratwurst. They have concentrated sauerkraut for blood. And they dress like Mountie Beaver stuffies. Are you guys tripping on the pot? I mean do you even hear how crazy that sounds? Yes. So I go down to the old Eh-2-Zed and I will look around myself. You know? Guy Lapointe style. and you want to know what I believe now? What? I believe that I believe you. You saw them? Yeah. I saw only this. You know. It was buried in a wad of cheese at the back of the microwave. I found this. What's this? This is a land purchase agreement signed in 1939 by the self-proclaimed Canadian Fuhrer. Adrien Arcand. For 100 acres in the Winnipegs. On this now sits a little store that could be very near and dear to your hearts. I think so. - Lulu Lemon? - He's talking about the Zed. Oh. Canadian Nazis were the original land owners of that piece of land where that store is now. And it is my theory that these horrific monsters never left. That's why I need both of you to help me solve this quite queer case of the untold tale buried beneath the Canadian convenience store. Which is probably what I should call the book. I think. Okay. so. When do we get out of here? We don't get out of here. I do. You don't. Because you're in the jail. " Right? I'm gonna speak to this fool in French for a second. Excuse me. I can get you inside the Eh-2-Zed. As you said. I can get myself inside the Eh-2-Zed quite easily. little kitty cat woman smarty pantsies. But you need me to show you the secret passageway. She's saying that I need her for the secret passageway. What secret passageway? The Colleen who doesn't speak the French has never heard of the passageway. My Dad showed only me the secret passageway. And I'll take you there. But you have to get us out of here. Understand? Shit... That means shit. Aw it's Hunter's chalk line. Ew. Maybe we should Instagram it. Ooh. right? Uh. Mr. Lapointe? Can we have our phones back now? You want your phones? No. I didn't steal your phones. You didn't get our phones? Do you mean that when I was illegally breaking you out of the jail that I forgot to steal your precious telephones. Is that what you're trying to say? Well. I'm sorry I'm so selfish. Right? How can I ever make it up to you? Well. you can start by letting us change out of these prison rags. Yeah. they make us look fat. You listen to me. You Lady Gagas. You know that this is not a photograph shoot for the Canadian Vogue. And I did not bring for you wardrobe styles with all that frilly business. So what would you like to do? Well. We have our Yoga clothes and backup smocks in the bathroom. can we at least go change into that? Yeah. and I'll take that over this Orange is the New Black bullshit any day. You have one Manitoban minute. And then you will show me the secret passage way. So you must hurry up. Hey. oh whoa. No poopie stuff. Ew. Okay. Colleen. seriously, why didn't you tell me about this secret passageway? That's so cool. Seriously. there is no secret passageway. I'm pretty sure there is a secret passageway. You said there was. I'm pretty sure I only said that to get us oot of jail. Colleen. God. If we don't prove the Bratzis exist. We're going away for murder. But what do we do aboot Guy Lapointe? I don't know. Colleen. I guess it's time to tell him there is no secret passageway. - Oh! Das boo! Oh. you're awake. Wunderbar. Wunderbar. Wunderbar. Wunderbar. Bratzis. no? Bratzis. I would like to welcome you. To my Canadian Subterranean Stronghold Located 37 feet below the surface of Winnipeg. Und I am Andronicus Arcane. That's that guy Ms. Maurice told us aboot in Honors History. The man from Berlin? Poof. He disappeared. Poop? Yah. frauleins. I am from Berlin. This is why I have an accent that sounds both scary und creepy. So in an effort to make our future communications less spooky and more friendly. I will now be speaking only in the voice of American movie star. Al Pacino. I bet all you need are the dulcet tones of one of Hollywood's greatest living actors. Hoowah. Do you know what. that's not a half-bad Al Pacino there. Thank you. - Who? - Al Pacino. Al Pacino. he was an American president? - Oh. - Geez. You see. the Third Reich imprisoned me here inside this Canadian Subterranean Stronghold. To build a clone army that would conquer Canada and the United States of America. Hoowah. I used my own DNA and made the clone bodies from the finest bratwurst and sauerkraut direct from Deutschland. So in 1945. I initiated the 100 year-long incubation process. And I put myself on ice. In a cryogenic chamber, timed to wake up when my little wiener babies were full-grown clones. But 70 years later... We've got real def. rhythms And fresh new jams You say we got egos... The little Colleens would change everything simply by singin' a song. Goddamn it. Ichabod. How much did you plug into that socket? You told me to plug everything into that soocket. We're 14 years old. Ichabod. Yeah. what are we supposed to know about physics. Ichabod? You guys wouldn't talk to me this way if I was covered in tattoos. The power outage in the Eh-2-Zed that night. Shorted out my ancient Canadian Subterranean Generator. So I woke up prematurely from my cryogenic slumber. But the incubation process had also been interrupted... Papa. Forever stunting the growth of my wiener babies. My life's work was a failure. Hoowah. That's so sad. Yeah. maybe it would be less sad coming from American tough guy. Sylvester Stallone. So. you know. Even though making clones was my life's work. It wasn't my passion. you know? This guy sounds like Groot. No. he was being Sylvester Stallone. Who? So. anyway, before I got into science and before the war. And then before I met Adrien Arcand. I was like. "Yo. Adrien." Adrian was the wife in the movie of the Rocky Rambo. He's very good. And before the Nazi No-good-nicks took over my life. I was an artist. you know? And my art was sculpting. You know. I'd chip away at the marble until it was beautiful to me. You know? I loved being an artist. Except for one thing. I'm talkin' about the goddamned critics. you know? They told me I had no talent. They told me I stink on ice. They're so negative and hurtful. They cut me. man. They drove me away from doing the thing I really love to do. Ya know. being who I am. That's when I found Adrien Arcand and Canadian Nazis and. you know, Hitler. Oh. Right? You know that this man is not a puppy on the internet? Maybe my Stallone is too aggressive I will switch to a Hollywood impression that is less threatening. So. I didn't want to be a Nazi for the rest of my life. The exit tunnel of my Canadian Subterranean Stronghold got me to the backroom of the Eh-2-Zed. And one night. after closing. I took my first steps into a brave new world. So. every night after the store closed, I would make myself at home in the Eh-2-Zed backroom. Where I learned to speak English and do voices. By watching every single thing on Netflix. I'll be... I'll be back. And I discovered that this modern world worships popular. Arts and entertainment. I'll be back. I'll... So, for the past six months. I've been sculpting again. Don't ya know? Sculpting up a storm with the help of my wicked little wiener babies. Wunderbar! May I present the debut of my first new work in decades. It's a sculpture celebrating my beloved adopted home of Canada. I call it. the Goalie Golem. So. what does everybody think? Well. I will tell you that this giant Canada man is very bold. And it's a real statement. You know? Mm-hmm. It captures perfectly that kind of essence of the True North. you know. Oh. thank you. But it also captures the actual people that you killed in the sculpture as well. Regrettably. Hmm. So I'm thinking that we should all be very afraid right now. But. Mr. Lapointe, you and the Colleens were never in any jeopardy. You see. I brought the Colleens here to help me. I have a need for their very specialized skills. Um. I don't mean to be mean. But I don't know who this is either. Rats. Do you want to try doing someone we might recognize? Hmm. Uh. do you know the actor who played the Batman? I can do him too. You see girls. Each night as I slaved away over my masterpiece. One dream fueled me. Uh. that does not sound like Batman. Yeah. Batman sounds like... Where's the trigger? Uhh. Where's the trigger? Uh. where's the trigger? Uh... No you don't understand. He's doing the original. The real Batman from the televisions. Adam West's Batman. - Wasn't it'? - Yes. It's supposed to sound like... Uh. where's the trigger. Joker? Uh uh. Where's the trigger? Do you know he never once said that line to the Joker. So just stop it. The only thing I've dreamed of for the past six months is looking at a photograph of me standing proudly next to my sculpture on the "Famous People are Just Like You" page of Them Weekly magazine. Oh my god. he reads it too! Isn't that page. like, the best? One time. they showed Harry Styles buying bacon. - It was so hot. - It was so hot. And this is my Harry Styles buying bacon moment. Now you are pleased to photograph me for Them Weekly magazine. You're kidding! You're never going to believe this. Mr. Old Man. but we don't have our phones. What? Nein. nein. nein. nein, nein. So much nein it's almost 10. How can this be? You always have with the phones. The cops took our phones. Surely you must have a phone. Herr Guy. My phone has no camera. What the fudge? So. nobody has a camera. I guess we have to go directly to phase two of my master plan. Fly my pretties, Fly! C'mon. Wunderbar! That's right. yes. Wiener babies, let's go! C'mon. c'mon. Let's all go to the lobby. Let's all go to the lobby Whoa. And okay for you. Mr. Straggler. Now you inside there. Now. my wiener babies. Bring mein art to life. Rise. rise! Rise! Yeah that's what I'm talkin' about. baby! - Wow. - Wow. That's the same thing that Them Weekly magazine is gonna feel when they see this baby. For tonight he is going to start his bloody rampage across the True North. Killing every art critic in Canada. What? Go my Goalie Golem. Go kill the critics and all the haters that gotta hate. Oh. I hate those haters. - You can't let him do this. - You've gotta stop him. Let me just hang on a minute. Let's... He's not talking about killing real people. He's just talking about killing critics. Mr. Lapointe! Let it go! Use the ladder! Go my Goalie Golem! - We can do this. - Yeah. We don't need his help. We do tons of stupid stuff without adults. - All the time. - All the time. It's just a bunch of Bratzis in a giant suit. And we beat a bunch of Bratzis before. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay but what are we gonna do aboot Guy Lapointeless over here? This epic fail? Unhand me. Unhand! Okay all we have to do is do every yoga pose Yogi Bayer ever taught us. That's your plan? What in the heck did your yogurt instructor teach you? He taught us to destroy everything that threatens anything and anyone you love. By hook or by crook. And that's the Yoga Way. Frenchie. Let's go. Wunderbar. wunderbar, wunderbar! Hey Bratzi Party. We wanna have a Weenie Roast. Wunderbar! Nein. Das frauleins! Wunderbar. Wunderbar. Wunderbar... Nein. nein, nein, nein, nein, nein.
