Relax. Smile. Smile. I can smell the money. It's real. Start! Go ahead. Thank you. What happened? What's the address? Alright. I'll send my friend there. The shipment has arrived. But I don't think you'll find what you're looking for there. But I'd still like to check it out. I really wish you happiness, my friend. Thank you, Boss. Young-chun. You're amazing. Back there, when you did this... If you say so. Then... You take it. But this is so expensive. Thank you. I'll think of you every time I look at it. I really admire you. Ro... Rolex? How does it look? I know your type. You'll go on kissing my ass, then turn around and stab my back. Understand? Border between Thailand and Laos Busan: 3 months later What the hell? God dammit! I got gum on my shoe. Hurry up! Who the hell did this? What's your hurry? It's not like we're his slaves... We were late last time. This is how you condition people, so they don't expect too much. No one expects anything of you. Really? Even you? Nope! I'm not going. Where you going? Let me go! I said I'm not going! Okay! Let go! It hurts! You worthless piece of trash. Who the hell do you think you are pulling shit like that? You think I met those Russians for my own sake? I'm doing this for us. Trust me. Please. I want to! But you still got a ways to go. You think anyone can do what they did? No way. Nice! How long are you gonna make me fill out these books? Uncle, if you keep on like this... What did you just do? I got my own plans. That book is worth more than you. Pick it up. Now! Pick it up! That little prick. He's not a nephew. More like a son of a bitch. Choong-shik, look at you! Why are you drinking so fast? Just like your old man. Show some respect. I'm almost sixty. I've known you since you were a baby. What should I say then? Please Mr. Choong-shik, sir? That's enough. What's keeping those bastards? - What the hell is this? - Put it on. - It smells. - Just put it on! Today is my little brother's first day of school Is that all you can talk about? I was always with him, wasn't I? What did Young-chun write... My Ideel Woman You idiot. It's been three years. You still can't spell? It's "My IDEAL Woman!" Give me a break. I barely have time to make ends meet. Nonsense. Come here! What's this? I know what you're up to. Sending out money, trying to find your brother. Hyuk, once you find him, wash your hands of all this. Promise? Okay. Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and Mongolia. How long in Mongolia? About 4 months. Other family or relatives? Any family or relatives! No one. I'm alone. Name? KIM Chul. Smart little bastard, aren't you? Kim Chaek University of Technology? Answer me, asshole! Yes. Then you had it good over there. Why the fuck did you leave? Hello? Debriefing room. You could've come here straight from Thailand. Why go through Myanmar? Taking a pleasure cruise around Asia? Answer the fucking question. I was looking for someone. Oh, really? Who? Who were you looking for, damn it! The man responsible for my mother's death. Watch out for the puddles. What's with the damn rain? Making a living ain't easy, is it? Or maybe it's easy for you. No, sir! Fuck, I told them to come yesterday. Welcome to Korea! Thank you! Korea's pretty cold, huh? You dumb fuck! Look at this. Gold mine! I'll get them the money soon! Hyuk, take Tae-min to Thailand this time. There's something he's gotta do there. Young-chun, you need to stay back and help me. What? Don't get me wrong. He just needs some more experience. This one's nice. What's that bastard going to do in Thailand? He left safely. Hyuk and I make a good team. Hey. Young-chun. Not bad. Alright, let's go. You out of your fucking mind? Where you going? You and I need to talk. I'm serious. - No thanks. - Hey, stop! Lieutenant PARK? Hyuk, it's your lucky day. I found him! Sorry? Go see for yourself if it's really your brother. We don't usually let people do this. I know, thank you. Hyuk. Chul. It's you, right? It's me, your brother. Look at me. Do you remember this? You tied this on my wrist at the beach. Remember? - Just a second... - Open the door, please! - Please open the door! - Look at me. Listen to me. I have something to say. At the border, I tried... Look at you? Fine. Take a good look! Look at me! Look at the face you abandoned! Because of you, they dragged mom away and beat her to death. Look at the face that saw it all. You're gonna get it. You deserve to die. Stop staring at me. Fuck. I said don't look at me! I'm going to kill you! I'll take your eyes out! Die, you coward! KIM Chul! Get a hold of yourself! Let me go! Tae-min will bring the cash. Let's hit it big this time. And Hyuk, shouldn't we throw a parade? We'll call the Busan Girl's High School band. Hang up a banner saying, Hooray! Hyuk found his brother! What do you think? There you go again. No, I really want to do this. If he's anything like Hyuk, he's gonna be brave. No one can mess with us now. The three of you are gonna own Busan. What's the matter? What? - Meet me at the airport. - Yes, sir. Don't you know when to shut up? What's wrong with them? Did I say something? These kids complain about everything. Fine, have it your way! Ungrateful little pricks! I can't help you. It's no use coming back. I did. But he refuses to see you. I can't do anything if he refuses to meet you. Then could you at least give him this? Fine. Give it to me. Thank you. Five minutes. Hyuk. Come on! How are you doing? I really wanted to see you. I know I don't deserve it but... Chul! I don't care what you think of me. But you're my little brother. And that will never change. Look here, Comrade KIM. Stop talking bullshit, and get the fuck out. I'll take whatever punishment you give me. I deserve it. To save my own skin, I left my own mom and brother. I'll take whatever you give me. But don't let us ever be separated again. That's the one thing I ask of you. This is nice! Not bad, right? You want me to go? To Thailand. I'll go. You stay with Chul... No, I should go. Young-chun, there's something... How long has it been? Ten years? I know we're partners and all, but 10 years? From the North to Thailand, then to Busan. It's an awful long time for us. So I was thinking... After this job, you should get out and focus on Chul. Don't worry about me. What am I talking about. Tae-min... Kill him! After him! Hurry up! Suspect found. Need more backup! - Hello. - It's me. Where are you? I'm somewhere far away. I have a favor to ask you. Anything but money. - Lieutenant PARK. - What? - About Chul. - What about him? My little brother... If you see him... What are you talking about? What's going on? Where are you now? Hyuk! Tell him I'm sorry. I'm not running away from him. I'll come back and get him. Hyuk, where the hell are you? Hyuk. I surrender! "NK Refugee Arms Dealer Arrested" Hyuk, I don't care if you want this or not. I'll make them remember us. Having fun? After some hesitation, I'm writing to you. Lieutenant PARK, I'm sorry. You loved me like a father. And always stood by me. I'm so sorry. I can't ask for forgiveness from you or Chul again. How have you been? Dear Hyuk, I know you're dying to hear about Chul. He's out of the resettlement center, and is safe with us. Auntie loves him, too. He's studying hard to become a policeman. I asked him why he wants to be a cop. Said there's a guy he wants to catch. Maybe it's because he misses this person. I gave him your letters. Busan: 3 years later Got it. I'll be right there. See you soon. - Where are you! - Fuck! Come here! Cut the shit! He already told us you sell guns. Where'd you get them? I just found them. Bullshit. You're selling them under Tae-min. Why do this to an innocent guy? Stop jerking me around, motherfucker! Alright. That's enough. You're fucked now. Want one? No thanks. Nobody's hungry around here, huh? You ever kill a man? What the hell? Ever tasted human flesh? What are you doing? When I was up North, my friend was dying. His last wish was to eat all the meat he wanted. So? I sold my bike, and bought all the meat I could. We ate all of it. Maybe because he got his wish, he died two days later. I was at his funeral, when someone came up to me, He wanted to buy the body, so they could use it for med-school. So I sold it. His body would go to waste in the ground anyway. When I got money, the first thing I wanted was to eat meat. So I went back to the market. The guy who bought my friend was selling meat. A basket full of meat. I can't get rid of that taste. How about I take a bite of you? No one's gonna miss you. I sold them! - I sold them! - What? The guns! I sold the guns. Boss. Good work. Just doing my job. Hey. Hey, Russian... What? Now go turn yourself in. Or else you can die. You guys will do anything for cash. I can't trust you. That's not true, I wouldn't betray you! Bury him. Please! Don't do this to me! This is the shoot-out at the station. It's the third one this year. Russian guns were found inside the car. Tae-min has been working with the Russians for three years now. And we've received information that all firearms go through him. LEE Young-Chun. A NK refugee, ex-special forces. He was in charge of weapons, but this is our main guy. KIM Hyuk. Three years ago, he was captured in Thailand and is still serving time there. No. He's out. He's coming back soon. You didn't know? Is he still following us? Yes, sir. Stop the car. What do you want? Why are you following me? Don't worry. Keep doing your thing. And what is it I do? Plenty. Drugs, whores, guns, murder... Then instead of following me, just arrest me, jackass. That's my plan, so get moving, motherfucker. Look, it's been over a year. You must be pretty fucking incompetent. Or maybe I'm just innocent. Learn to accept it. And don't just learn how to swear. Just like his big brother. A little bitch. CHUNG Tae-min. Stop right there. Fuck off. Get me, if you can. Stop! Get off him! Listen up, asshole. Hyuk is not my brother. Got that? Look who it is. What's with the clothes? Welcome back. Why would you do that! What are you doing here? How could you? Go back! I said go! I forgot the kimchi stew. No, no sit down. You missed my cooking, huh? You should go see Chul. Come on, you fool. If he curses, you listen. If he hits you, just take it. Before I forget, I put the deposit from your house into this account. His address is in there too. Go see him. You both went through so much, to turn your backs on each other now. It's been long enough. Where's Young-chun? Forget about him. Hey you. You call that a car wash? The inside's still filthy. Never mind, you dumbass. Hey, wait. Crap. Mister, you didn't pay me. Here, take it! Nothing beats drinking with an old buddy. This is great. What happened to you? Oh, my leg? Just a bad accident. Sweet. This is how it should always taste. I'll show you something cool. Look at this. Beats the ones we used to ride, huh? Let's get one and take it out to sea. It'll be awesome. With you back, things are gonna change. It's a good sign. Tae-min's making a deal with the Russians soon. It's gonna be big. What's this? Let's go see a doctor first. Then... Bro, don't do this to me. It's not over yet. I still have dreams. Why do you think I'm still here? Young-chun, it's not that easy anymore. Fuck. Now you're taking pity on me? LEE Young-chun? You come back after 3 years and throw me a couple of bucks? Because I'm crippled? Fuck you. Young-chun the Great is alive and well. Want me to prove it? Huh? Know how I survived with this in my pocket? How this kept me going when you weren't around? You may be happy with finding your brother, but what about me? Take care. Let's get rid of Young-chun. What? Are you crazy? The old bastard's getting on my nerves. He should just sit quiet in his little shack. Tae-min, you're doing good. Leave them alone. You have them to thank for where you're at now. So don't be so... Boss CHUNG. Listen carefully. If you mention them in front of me once more, consider us through. - Let's go, Kwang-hee. - Yes, sir. What did I do wrong this time? I want to know the reason. I've been on the case for a whole year. This isn't fair. This is for your own good. I mean, for you and your brother. You're offthe case. No questions asked. He's not my brother. He'sjist another ex-con and criminal. You don't say? I can tell when a bastard lies. So can I. I've had first-hand experience. KIM Chul. You've never betrayed someone. You think you know what he's feeling? Take a look at this. Then decide if you want him dead or not. Learn about the enemy, and you'll learn about yourself. "At the beach with Chul" That jackass is here again. Oh, sorry! Sorry about that, Boss. You should take this with you. On your way then. So is it gonna happen or not? They got word, that you're under surveillance by the cops. What a fucking coward. So when? This month? Next month? Three months. At least. Anyway, sir. Don't you think we should wait it out a bit? Seems like it's too soon. I've got it planned out already. I'm on my way! Almost there. Yes sir! Yes, sir. We're right behind him. I'm here. I don't see you. Where are you? I can see you just fine. Behind you. I called for a driver. You got something against me? Let me make it up to you. Stop by the office. We'll find something for you. I'm done with all that. Are you sure? Yeah. Don't have to worry about me. Worry? I'll be honest. I need your help. It's something we can't pass up, and the cops are on my back. I mean Chul. I was lonely when you left. But your little bro has kept me company. Get your ass out here! You know why you're still alive? Caise I betrayed someone once too. But if you touch my brother, I'll kill you. Come in. The soup is ready. Have some more. People need to eat well to sirvive. Want a drink? Who is this? Chul! - Where have you been? - Hello? Have you eaten? Sit down. I'll get you a bowl. What is this?! Is this how you two ate at home? Is this really necessary? Who knows what will happen three months from now. I'll take care of them afterwards. You're only worried about Hyuk. What about Young-chun? Even if he's got a bad leg, he's still got hands. Plis he's inpredictable. He's the one yoi need to worried aboit. You shoild know from experience. I know a liar when I see one. That was you, right? This is it. As of today, Chul is off the case. Look who's here! Hyuk. It's good to see you! Come have a seat! What are you waiting for? Have a seat! You come out here. What are you trying to pull? What? Did yoi not inderstand what I said? What are you doing here? Come inside and talk. There's a big transaction soon. The whole company's at risk on this one. What do you say? One last go? For old times sake? I've quit all that. What if Young-chun does it? That's too bad. Hyuk, let's be fair. Young-chun's limping because he avenged you. Don't you feel sorry for him? You wanna die? Shut your fucking mouth. You crazy? Talk to me! I never asked you to go do that. It was my decision. It had nothing to do with you. Fuck. What the hell is wrong with us? I had to do something. We couldn't lose face like that. I'm gonna go. What are you up to! What did you talk to him about? What are yoi planning with Tae-min? It's not what you think, Chul. Don't say my name, you worthless piece of trash! Trash? This is your brother. Your older brother. The only one in the world. And you call him trash? Your brother is trash? Take it back. Apologize, you little bastard! You better be careful. I'm gonna put you away, too. Shoot then. Shoot me now. Stop it. Shoot me you little prick! - Shoot! - I said stop! Detective KIM. I'm not in it anymore. Now that you're a detective, and have adjusted to life here. I feel so happy and sorry. I'm happy for you. I've gotten out of that business. Please believe me. "Dear Chul," "I miss you... " Son of a bitch. Damn idiots. What are you doing here! Hungry? Shit. Where's Lieutenant PARK? Told him to get some rest. Any movement? If the DA finds out you're here, I'm fucked, too. Look. You troublemaker. Whatever. Put on some music. I'm so sick of this. Family doing well? Yup. They eat like crazy. Know what the opposite of "police" is? It's "family". Still, it's better to have some than none. Be good to him. Where is he going? Want to see what my son wrote me? It's really great. It's in the back. Oh, it's in there? He's all grown now. I'm really proud of him. Uh oh. An accident. What should we do? Detective LEE! Bro, wake up! What's going on? What should we do? Let's go outside. What happened? It was Tae-min, wasn't it? It was my fault. I should've been the one killed. Now I'm just like you. I have no right to blame yoi anymore. No. You're different. Do me a favor. Let's end it here. Please just go away. I'll call you "brother" if that's what you want. But I don't want to see you anymore. Brother. Young-chun. You were so cool back in the days. Look at you now. If I were you, I would kill myself. Young-chun. You remember this? You gave it to me. Turns out it's a fake. I knew it back then. But I kept it. Why? To remind myself of my goal. Why? Because you're the fake, and I'm the real one. Look at me now. More powerful than Hyuk, and more powerful than you. Understand? It's okay. We're alright. Where're you going? Don't go do something stupid. If you do, don't bother coming back. Young-chun. What's wrong? Can you hear me? Young-chun! Pull yourself together! What do you want me to do? Hyuk, you think you owe me? You don't owe me a thing. I'm getting out, anyway. I can't beat that fucker, Tae-min. I just can't. Look at my face. It's gonna be nice to just start over. Take care of yourself. I'll see you again. Who's that? Oh, it's Young-chun! Going to school with that bag? Open it. I don't have the key. Open the door! Get in! What the hell. I knew you were gonna screw it ip. What's wrong with you! If you don't find that book, we're all... Fucking mouth. Hyuk, what are you doing man? It's called payback. Have you looked at the book? The names yoi see most after mine - are Hyuk and Young-chun. - Give me the phone. Listen, you talk too much. Bring one million US by midnight. Got it? Daddy's friends are all here. Where's daddy? You mean there's infighting? Says who? One of Tae-min's guys? I'll be right there. What the... Hey, where are you going? - Wait a sec... - Chul... Life in the South didn't turn out to be what we thought. Yeah, I'd say we did pretty well in this shithole. This is really it. It'll take 20 minutes by motorboat. No coming back. They brought the whole gang. Nice weather. Isn't it? Where's the money? Your turn. What the fuck! The book? The cops have it. You think you two can get out alive? I don't plan to. As long as you're dead. Stop. Put the guns down. Put them down! Get them. Don't tell them you heard it from me. Hyuk called up the DA. Said he's gonna turn Tae-min in. Because ofthat the cops are movin' out. But you shouldn't go. The phone you have dialed is turned off. Why are you doing this? Hyuk, get in! Damn it. Come on! Go ahead! I got some unfinished business. Hyuk. Hyuk! Goddammit! What the fuck! You think I'm gonna stay behind and die alone? I'll join you soon. Fuck! I'm done. What're you up to? Let's finish this. One of us is going to die. It's not going to be me. Stay back. What the hell! Boss! We're not the only ones dying. He looks ready to go too. Send him over. Send him. Hey brothers, this is the end for you. Kill them! Kill those bastards! Let go of me! How did you get here? Chul, are you okay? You were going to leave me again! I'm not going anywhere. Shit! Where did he come from? Chul! You okay? Bro... Those fuckers. You're all dead. What are you doing? Look. Look at this face. Look at your brother! What do you see? He's still worried about you! That's your big brother. Stand up! Damn you. Lucky bastard. What about me? Young-chun! Fuck! Son of a bitch. Let go of my neck! C'mon you assholes, let's do this. Don't you cry. Brother. Even when I'm gone. Don't you go crying. Okay? You promised to take care of me. I was going to. But things didn't work out. Let's start over. I'm sorry. I was wrong. I'm sorry. Hyuk, I came here to tell you something. To say I missed you. Brother! Tae-min! Come out and surrender! Fuck. I repeat... Tae-min! Come out with your hands up! I surrender! Fuck off. Chul! Put the gun down! Put the gun down! He said put the gun down. You guys don't belong here. Take your brother and go back. Go back to North Korea. Little bitch. Fuck... Hyuk. Let's go together. We'll always stay together because we're tied right? You're right. We'll never separate.
