And not by sitting on my ass either waiting for the stupid money fairy to hit me on my stupid damned head. You know that what you're doing is completely stupid. Unless, of course, you pull it off, in which case it can be completely brilliant. Yeah. I suppose if I were in your shoes, I would do exactly the same. [baby crying] (Cor) Ah, there he is. What are you doing? Huh? (Cor) What are you doing? You can't bring a kid to this. He can wait outside with Brakes. [sigh] This is fucked up. [several shouting] Listen, it's not fucked. It's fine. Cat, can you put the kid down, please? Just give him to my little brother. Right. Now, is everyone ready? (Cat) Yes. Is everyone ready? (Spikes) Yeah! Alright, let's do this. (Cor) Well, it's a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Iverson. My name is Cor Van Hout. This is Mr. Holleeder, Mr. Boellard, and Mr. Meijer. We're here today in the hope of asking you for a loan. A loan? (Willem) Yeah. It's a business loan. And what particular sort of...? Construction. (Cat) Yeah, we were doing well. (Willem) Yeah, really well. You've been running a company employing a hundred men? Yeah, well, we were all equal partners, yeah, right down the middle there. Um, Mr. Boellard here is a master carpenter. Mr. Meijer has a... if these numbers are real, you're in fine shape. Surely, if you've been making this kind of money, you must have investments that you could stake as collateral? (Cor) Uh, well, we had, uh, you know, cars, and we had boats and we had some race horses but... Equities, bonds, pension funds? When the recession hit, we cashed in. The cars, the boats, the horses? It's for paychecks, uh, for guys living from one Friday to the next. I think you can understand that their kids can't live or eat off IOUs. I think, maybe, what you haven't heard, Mr. Big Manager, is that, uh, there's a world of hurt out there right now... Oh, believe me, I know. Well, we still got a building. Great. What's the address? Uh, it's Leidsegracht. Six six three. Hold on. Leidsegracht? The commune? Commune? It's a bunch of punks that don't pay their rent. It's hardly a fucking commune. Yes. Squatters. We're in the process of evictions. Government says once they change the locks, they've got rights. So that means lawyers. I do see your problem. But you're welcome back when you solve it. [shout of frustration] [baby crying] (Cat) Guys like him don't lend money to guys like us. We'll get the punks out of the building. Yeah. How are you going to do that? (Cor) Yeah. I got an idea. Alright, listen. You're going to love this. (Cor) it's time to go, boys! Hey, what's going on? Time to go! (Spikes) Open up! (Cor) Cat, get in through a window, not the front door! [banging] Open up! [shouting] (Cat) Come on down! (girl) You don't scare me! You fucking stink! [shouts] Whoa! I'll come back for you. Get the fuck out! [banging] Coming! [banging continues] Fucking coming! [shouting] (man) Oh, shit! (girl) Get out of here! Shit. (man) Oh, shit! Oh! [shouting] (punk) Get the fuck out of here. Oh, shit. [shouting] You going to go? Go and get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck out! Go on! [police sirens] (pothead) Now you're in trouble! Go! Go! Everyone out! (police officer) Go, go, go! (Spikes) Hey, this is our building! We own this place! (man's voice) Fuckface! Police! Police! Everybody go! You want to do this? No. No, I think I'll pass. Pussy. Hey! Whoaaa! (man's voice) Charge! [shouting] (man) Get your fucking hands off of me now. (Cor) I hope... well, fuck it. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Fine. Thank you. Bye. What'd he say? (Cor) Well, he said if we lived in Texas, they'd throw us a parade. But here, well you know how that is. Yeah. Anyway, good news. Squatters aren't going to press charges. How kind is that? Whooptiedoo. Happy days. (cop) Cornelius Van Hout. Yo. Thank you. Only Van Hout. (Spikes) Huh? Hey. Bad news. You guys resisted arrest. Plus, not only do they get to stay in the building, we got to pay for the shit we busted. Yeah, including the fish! Fuck the fish. Sonja? Hey. Uh-oh. [chuckles] No, no, no. Listen. I can explain. L... Sonja, please, will... Son...! [lock clicks] Sonja, what are you doing? [vomiting] You alright? What's going on, Son? [baby gurgling] [chuckling] What are you doing? What are you doing hiding in my kitchen? Hey, who are you? Who are you, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know who you are. I just worked it out. Yeah, that's right. You know what? You are way too good-looking to be Karin's boy. Hm? Oh, hey, Karin, hey. Hey, how you doing? I was just joking... if you had any idea what's been going on with Sonja, then you wouldn't do as you do. [toilet flushing] What do you mean "going on"? Sonja, please, wh... what's going on? I'm pregnant. Ah. Ah. What? Ha. Wow. That's, uh... [chuckles] Really? That's unbelievable. You're fucking pregnant? Yeah. I'll leave you two to it then. Bye! See you, Karin! Hey, come on, you! [door closes] (Willem) Happy New Year! Hey! Hey, Ma! Look at your hair and your dress, you look like a model. Thanks. (Ma) Hey, be careful! Yeah, your sister's knocked up. Yeah, I know it's great. He doesn't greet his old man... or even have a beer with him. You know I don't drink. Especially Heineken. Look at me when you talk to me. [deep sigh] Heineken beer and Heineken money paid for this house and for your upbringing. You see that? The man is my friend. But he fired you and I don't think he remembers your name. You owe him respect. Okay, let's go. (Mom) Oh! (Cor) Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bye, honey. Happy New Year. Bye, Mom. Bye. Bye. Take care of her. Thank you. Alright. Thank you. Invite him round next time, Pa. We'll all kiss his ring. Well, that was festive. Oh, come on. Let's have some fun. Let's go to Karin's. Aw, come on, Sonja. You know what we got to do. Hey? Come on. I'll look after him. Come on. Come on. It's tradition, alright? Yeah, go. You don't mind? No! No? Alright, I love you. Love you, too. Go! Have fun! (Cor) Here's to making this year count. Alright, to getting our old lives back. (Willem) Yeah, some fucking New Year. We've no money, the company's bankrupt, and no one's going to give us a loan. So how are we going to get our old lives back? Huh? We could get jobs. Yeah, that's the alcohol talking. Ha. I'm not getting a real job. No, I'm not going to bust my ass every single day to go absolutely nowhere. I think this year I refuse to be miserable. Actually, that's, uh... that's why I want to talk to you guys about some business. Cor, we just got out of jail. I'm not talking about that kind of business. I'm talking about smart business. So what type of business you planning? I'm planning something organized, something big. How big? Big enough that we never have to grovel to another asshole banker again. Yeah, right, man. (Willem) We betting? Or we talking about a crime? That's all crime is. It's a wager. (Cor) Right? Think about it. You bet your liberty against the payoff. All I have to bet, all I have left... is my liberty. And that's all you guys have. That's all you've got left to bet. So if you're going to bet that, I guess you're going to have to bet it big. How big? Sixty million. [laughing] Shit. Sixty? Who are you going to kidnap? Kidnap? Come on, man. Shit. Man, I thought you were serious. Idiot. You're an idiot. He's serious. I'm serious. He's been talking about this since we were fucking kids! Grabbing anybody is easy. Collecting the ransom and getting away with it is impossible. (Cor) It's not. It's not impossible. Who do you want to kidnap? Got to be a local. It's got to be a guy. I'm not messing with women or children, eh. He's got to be stinking fucking rich. You're out of your fucking mind. (Cor) It's like I said... let's make this year count, huh? [boom] Woo! (Cor) Happy fucking New Year! [rain falling] Hi, there. Guys, look what I've got. Huh? Cat, this is specially for you. Oh. Wow. What is this? Who do I look like? What do you think? I don't know if I love these or hate these. They're scary, eh? I look like Willem. No, you look like a fucking pervert. Where's Willem anyway? I'm not wearing a wig. We got to find a place so we can hide him where no one's going to look. My workshed would be perfect but there's an office full of bean counters next door. Guys, we can't just dump him in the shed. No. But we could build a room inside the shed. (Spikes) That's good. It's perfect. I found a boat we can steal. It's fucking fast. Was a boat on the list? No. So why are we talking about a boat? I'm trying to think outside the box. Come on. Yeah, well, don't. Whoa. (Cat) Guns are on that list. Right? Okay. Yes. Now be careful with that, please. World War II? Safety's a little edgy on that! [gunshot] Fuck, Spikes! Man... [loud knocking] Shhh. What? Hear that? [knocking continues] Shit. We're good? We're good? We're good? Yeah. Here I go. What the fuck? (Cor) it's okay. (Willem) What was that? Yeah, it was just fucking Rambo over here. Listen, man. Where have you been? I've been thinking about how we grab Heiny. We've been trying to come up with some ideas, too. What you got? If we're going to do this, we have to make sure that the cops look in the wrong direction. That they have to believe that whoever took Heiny he's, like, some big swinging dick, like... Baader Meinhof? Or Red Brigades? Mafia? And those fuckers they don't mess around. Yeah? For a job like this, they would have military grade weapons, radios. They would have a safehouse to hold him. They would have months of preparation, months of observation. They would spend at least a hundred grand. Same old story, man? Want to get rich? You got to be rich already. Yeah. If you want to do this on a shoestring, fine. But the cops are going to look for a bunch of local jerkoffs and they're going to nail us fucking flat. Oh, fuck it. (Cor) Let's pay another visit to the bank. (Cor) Remember: shoot at the ground. We know. Okay, guys. Let's go. Now! On the ground! Now! [shouting] Go, go, go! Come on! Go! Go! [police siren] (Willem) Put your gun down! [shouting] Sorry! Look out! [girl screams] He's gone to the next canal! That's it! (Cor) Cat! Get ready to cut the rope! Go, go! I'll cover you! [gunfire] [shouting] Come on! Hurry up! Come on! Shoot at the ground! Shoot at the ground! Get down! Shit! [shouting] Get out of the way! Look out! Hoo! Woo-hoo! You sure it's clear? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Cor. Wow. Now who's big swinging dicks? Alright, it's time to get down to business. (Sonja) How was your day? (Cor) Yeah, it was fine. It was good. Somebody robbed a bank. Yeah, I know. I heard that. With machine guns, like, Al Capone. They shot hundreds of bullets. [chuckles] Hardly. I don't think so. It was all over the radio. And the TV. Where have you been? With Cat. I was helping him with his boat. Where? What do you mean "where"? At the, um, marina. Up in Newlake. Does he ever pay you for stuff like that? Yeah. Yeah, he does. [paper wrinkling] Mm. Okay, okay. Nice. [sigh] Amazing thing about that robbery. Mmm. All that gunfire. They didn't hit anyone. Yeah? Yeah, really. Yeah, that's good. Mm. [distant chatter] Thank you. [distorted] I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. That's good, right? I'm going to take that. [distorted] How much do I owe you? Hmm. I'm going to need a couple. (guy) May I ask you something? You're not from around here. No, I'm just, uh, passing through. Here's my private telephone number. I can show you around. (Cat) I weighed it. Thirty five million is all we can carry. Maybe the wood blocks that were heavier than the money. No, they're not. I checked. It'll all have to be small denominations. (Cor) Yeah, and different currencies. I've carried twice as much. Oh, aren't you one? I already picked out my Ferrari. A Ferrari? Yeah! You couldn't handle a Ferrari. You can barely handle a scooter. Fuck you, man. You want a Ferrari because you got a small dick. Fuck you, man. [all laugh] Ahhh! [silence] [click] (shouting over machine) Ahhh! I didn't hear anything. Yeah, well. I'm surprised. Well. Yeah. We have to test these as well. [click] Cat? Oh. Cat?! (Cor) Where is everything? What happened to the cells? What's going on? What...? What's going on? Where is everything? (Cat) I want you to think of the Anne Frank house. (Spikes) Oh, yeah. Anne Frank! Fucking brilliant. [clapping] You're a genius. Come again. You're a fucking genius. Where's the door? Ask and you shall receive. We did do a door, right? [laughter] Ah, good job. [typewriter clacking] "Respond to our ransom demand "by the deadline "by running the code word 'Notice' "in the newspaper or you'll never see Heineken or Doderer ever again." [clacking ends] Okay. Take it. [rubbing] [rain falling] [rhythmic flapping] Can you fucking stop that? Okay, it's time. [police radio man's voice] Shit. No, it's nothing. You don't know that. Look, it's nothing. It's just a coincidence. There's always an excuse if you're looking for it. If we're going to do this, we do it now. (Cat) Here we go. Alright, let's go. Let's go. (Cor) Now remember, if we need to speak, then we only speak in German. (Spikes, speaking in German) [door opens] (Heineken) Lovely evening. We'll be in touch. (Heineken) Alright. Huh? Hands off. What are you doing? [spraying] [woman screams] [much shouting] Who are you? [shouting] Let me go! Let me go! [shouting] Dumb shit! Get into the fucking van! [shouting] What? [whistle] [gun cocking] [Heineken shouting] [police siren] (Heineken) Alright, alright, alright. (Doderer) Ahhh! [handcuffs clicking] Ahhh. Okay. Ohhh! Alright, okay, okay, okay. Alright, let me have all their clothes. Come on. That's nice. I'll get the barrel. Hey, can we talk now? I told you to speak in German! Your man didn't fight like mine. Shhh. Enough! (Cor) Alright, listen. Did anybody leave their fingerprints on this ransom note? Huh? I'll ask again. Did anybody touch this with their bare hands? I may have. Oh, fuck. Alright. ls there anybody next door? They should have left by now. Come with me. Come on. Let's start. Willem, where do I start? Here. [Cat, whispering] The copier is there. Let's go, let's go. It's okay. We got a new one. You got his watch? Alright. Now remember, once you're done with that, you make out like it's any other night. Mm-hm. We'll be at the bar. I'll be there. It's our alibi. Hey, kid. You good? Yeah? You sure? Alright, good. (Cat) Just don't think about it being a police station, alright? Ever think you'd deliver an invoice for 35 million? Are they really going to pay all that? They have to. Can't we just mail it? Come on. Take a breath. Breathe. Go. [inhales] [exhales] [door closes] [light chatter] It's not exactly my favorite neighborhood either. [car engine starts] [bar music playing] Package is delivered, boys. You good? We're heading home. Cat, Cat, Cat. Stay for one minute. Come on, stay for one. Yeah, one drink, one drink. You alright? Do it. Ring the bell! Ring it! [bell ringing] [whole bar cheers and claps] [shouting] [door opens] You guys do it up right last night? Well, you know me. We made sure we were seen and we kept it respectable. Good. You? Oh, it was riveting. I fell asleep watching cartoons with the kids. Yeah. Well? How are they? Heineken's fine. Pissed off. The driver is not too good. [shout] [whimpering] [breathing rapidly] [distorted] Now you listen to me. You are in no danger here. Anhh. As long as the money is paid, you will be released. Anhh. Do you understand? [groan] Hey, guys. Check it out. [sigh] [inhales deep] [sigh] [chain clinking] Do you have a name? No name. Is it ransom or money? Are you the boss? Okay, you're the boss. So, I have a few requests. I'd like a bathrobe, slippers, a shaving kit, comb, mirror, um, reading glasses, a decent fucking chair... and, um, what else? Oh, yes, and if it's not too much trouble, a telephone. You have no name, huh? You're part of an organization? You're Baader Meinhof? Red Brigade? IRA? Symbionese Army? (Cat) Hey, Cor. (Cor) What? Look at this. What? Oh, fuck. You're going to love it. Oh, nice. Mm-hm. Nice, nice. Says five guys involved. How many have you? This one says three. (Cor) Yeah, listen to this. "An unknown number of most certainly dangerous and experienced criminals." Let me see, let me see. It's perfect. (man on TV) More about this morning's top story... Alfred Heineken, the billionaire of brewing, was kidnapped by a group of heavily armed men yesterday... I know who did it. ...corporate in Amsterdam, Police have now confirmed that they... Who? Bud. Weiser. Bud Weiser. Yeah? One way to beat the competition, huh? Funny guy, huh? Police would not disclose the size of the ransom demanded but it is assumed to be significant. What? The ransom note. What? The ransom note. What do you mean? Did we leave it? In the copier? No, no. ...chased, until he was threatened by the kidnappers with a machine gun. Wait, did we...? (Cor) No, did we? Oh, fuck. [door opens] (Cat) Hey, uh... George. George, yeah. Remember me? Yeah. How's it going? Same old, same old. So everything's alright? I guess. Do you mind if we make a quick copy? Go ahead. Thank you. Thank you. [chatter and chuckling] [murmuring] [woman singing in German over speakers] Thank you. Thank you for that, too. I assume you, uh, sent a note about the ransom. Did they reply? Well, they will. [opens door] In the meantime, this music, it's beautiful and laden with tragic disillusion but, uh, the same tape over and over again, all day long, please, I know I am your prisoner but there's no need to torture me, my friend. Some Johann Sebastian Bach would be quite soothing. Or, well... Franz Fucking Schubert, anything. Silence, preferably. Also, some books would pass the time and as much as I adore ham sandwiches, my friend, Chinese food is quite easy to get, and it's cheap too, and, uh, I know, something like, um, yeah, Bang Bang chicken. With some extra chili sauce, how about that? Okay? (Cor) Happy birthday. Cheers. [cheerful chatter] (man) You'll be looking for a regular paycheck now, hey. (Ma) Ah, finally. I can serve the cake now. Hi, honey. (man) No more fooling around, huh? My son Mark, he drives a tram. (Cor) Yeah, I know Mark. Yeah, he's got good hours. Most importantly, he's got a good pension. Uh-huh. You'd have to take the training first. Really? They train? I could have a word with him... Yeah, could you? [chuckling] Always the same stupid joke. [chuckling] (Dad) From my daughter as well, now? Wonderful. What a kind and thoughtful gift, thank you. Pa, it was a joke. Cannot you at least wait till they let Mr. Heineken go, huh? (Dad) if they ever do let him go. (Ma) Don't start on this again. If I get those filthy bastards, I will kill them. We know. We know. Kill them! Willem, please, it's Pa's birthday. Come on. (Spikes, off) Cat? How long do you reckon it'll take Heineken's people to pay the ransom? Cat. How long do you reckon it'll...? No more questions. Because I don't have the answers. [man singing on speaker] Help pick up the pieces  [door opens] Of a broken heart  Hey. Aw, thanks. Hey, and thanks for the new music. It's very whimsical, very droll. Yeah. Got books! Good. Alright. Any luck with the Bang Bang? Huh? No? (man) Some guys like Bang Bang chili all the time. But you like sweet sour. Ever since five years. Sweet sour pork, sweet sour prawn, sweet sour beef. You're a sweet sour guy. So it's Chinese, right? Now me is a chili guy. Okay, okay. You a goddamn Bang Bang man. [cash register rings] Right. See you tomorrow. What can I get for you? Ah! Wake up. Fuck you, man. Did they run the notice? Not yet. Come on, man, this was only supposed to take five days. What if he is sick? We gotta kidnap a fucking doctor? Is he sick? No. Don't get too personal. Or he'll get inside your head. [bar chatter] Look, leather jacket, Popeye. Cops? [soft whistle] (Cor) Willem, even if they are cops, it doesn't mean anything. You okay? Fuck, I'm just done waiting. Yeah, I know. I know. Alright? Me, too. [sigh] What are you trying to do? Huh? Uh-huh. Yeah. Mm-hm. If you tell the Police where I am, I could give you half the ransom and, uh, a house in Switzerland. Lots of beautiful Swiss girls, blond, they're beautiful. I'll... I'll arrange it as many as you like. No? You're not interested? Are you gay or something? Huh? Any news from the Police? Oh. [kiss] [click] (Cor) It's been over two weeks now. (Willem) The longer they don't pay the money, the more time they have to figure out who did it. You want to give up? (Cat) I do. (Spikes) You what? [sigh] I do, yeah. Let's let him go. Knock down the cells, burn everything. Okay, we don't get the money, but you know what we do get? Our lives back. Oh, come on. Come on, look, they're just messing with us. That's all that is. Cat, where you going? Uh... Really? Cat... Wait! We failed! It's my fucking shed. I want him out of there. Before it's too late. Look, just listen! Just listen. Listen, listen, alright? Look, it's all just part of the game. We're still in control here. You really want to walk out... on 35 million? Huh? What we got to do is make the transaction. Thirty-five million. Someone has got to relieve Brakes. Alright. I'm going home. [door opens and closes] [dogs barking] [distorted] They didn't pay. You've got to be kidding me. What do you mean they didn't pay? Last night was the deadline. We told them that we would kill you if they didn't pay. And they didn't fucking pay! So time's up! Okay. There must be some confusion. It's confusion, that's it. Damn, I'm their boss! Nobody else. Must be out of their fucking minds. I'll fire them all! Give me a pen and paper. Give me a pen and paper now! And you're all fired! You as well. Don't worry, you'll get your blood money. You know you will. You have my word of honor. Okay? Okay?! You fucking morons! Yeah. What's his problem? What? (Cor) Now you listen to me. Tell me you'll sign... Ooh. Can we also have your word of honor right now, in writing, that when you're free, you won't help the police in any way? My word of honor? Yeah. Yeah. That's the way the game is played. You've got my word. It's time to end it now, okay? (Ab) Hello? W... why is the door open? Hello? (Heineken) Ab, is that you? Boss? Yeah. Boss, are you alright? Yeah, I'm sort of okay. Tired of this crap. Oh, God. Um... Are you okay? Have they left you alone or given you a rough time? I don't know, I... l... l... How long have we been in here now? A month? I don't know, I've lost track. I'm a little confused, it feels longer. Now, now, I'll tell you now. It comes to... [counting] Oh, almost three weeks. Yeah. Why the hell are you here? You've got no money to offer these jokers. (Ab, over speaker) Well, if... if your people don't pay, then, uh, then these guys need to prove that they're not fooling around and... well, it can't be your head... they'll send to the police in a box. (Heineken) Don't worry, Ab. We'll... pay whatever it takes. If it's a hundred million, we'll pay. (Cor) I want to get out of this as much as you guys. But we have to let them sweat it out another week. Let them believe that their screw-up killed Heineken. You remind me again why we grabbed the driver. Why? What's your point? A question the police are asking. Is, uh... are these guys the real deal? Or are they just a bunch of pussies? And if the answer is they're a bunch of pussies, they're going to string this out forever. So what are you trying to say? Well, we said if they don't pay, then there'll be blood. You wrote that in the letter. This is business. It's nothing personal. And they didn't fucking pay. I agree. (Cor) Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah? You agree? Yeah. With him? Alright, good. Big man, alright then, slice his fucking throat. I'll do it. (Cat) Willem... Hey. Hey. Hey. You're acting like a scared little boy. Hey, you fucking do it! A scared little boy. [angry shouts] Fuck! I didn't sign up for this! Cor, if he does anything... anything! If he does anything in there, it's fucking on you. Do something! Fuck. Man! Use your head! Oh, fuck. [gasping] [whimpering] Oh, fuck. [door locks] [gasping] You alright? Stop what you're doing. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Come here. Come on. Come on. Is he alright? Yeah, no, he's okay. He's fine. We all just need to go home, take a breather, get drunk, get laid, whatever you got to do. But we just got to stick to the routine and we'll see each other in a few days. Alright. Let's go. (man over radio) ...in a case that has riveted the nation and much of Europe, the kidnapping of billionaire Alfred Heineken has entered its 19th day. With no substantial leads and no end in sight, a massive manhunt involving local and federal law enforcement continues. [door closes] (Cor) Oh, hey. Where've you been? You were supposed to be at birth class. What? No, S... Fuck. No, no, no. Sonja! Listen, I'm sorry. Listen, I'll make it up to you! Alright? I'll make it up to you. Sonja... [sigh] Have they paid? Am I to be set free? Did you give them my message? You know, they have one more chance. If they screw it up this time... And they know I've given you my word so they will pay, so... how are you planning to set us free? I will put the both of you in a car and, uh, leave it somewhere. Call your people. Oh, good. Listen, if your people don't pay soon, then I can't answer for my people. I'll tell you what. If you put us in that car right now, I'll, uh... see to it that you get what you want and... I'll make sure you're free to spend it. That's a promise and I have the power to do that. You know? Of course. You're a young man and I must confess, I do envy you. There's no way you could have done this without... [deep sigh] No way you could have done it without those men in your life that you trust with your life. Friends. So congratulations, well done, and uh... soon you'll get your money and then you will be... very, very rich. But, um... But what? No, what I meant to say, my friend, is that, uh... there are two ways a man can be rich in this world. He can have a lot of money or he can have a lot of friends. But he cannot have both. [noise] (Sonja) Cor? Yeah? Rub my back? Please? Yeah, yeah, I will later. Yes. Listen, l... I gotta go. (Cor) They put the notice we requested in the newspaper. Yeah? They're ready to pay. Good. What's this? Proof of life photo? Can I just comb my hair a bit? No? [sigh] No. He's looking too relaxed. Leave my damn hair alone! [camera shutter clicks and buzzes] [gasping] Please, please don't hurt me. Read. [recorder clicks] Read aloud, you idiot. Uh... "Eagle's instructions for the Mouse. "Paint a large white X "on the orange van used for the kidnapping. "Depart ten minutes after this call. "If anyone follows it will be "the end of the hostages. "Go to Utrecht Central Station. "The luggage locker number nine, "collect the assignment and await instructions from the Eagle. "The next message for the Mouse, he will drive to Hotel Totenhoff." (Willem) There it is. "By the lamppost outside the main entrance you will find a plastic jar filled with further instructions." Officer Hendricks for Headquarters. The next place would be the gas station in Jahr. Alright. Last call. Come on. Come on. (Willem) Alright. [phone rings] Yes, this is the Mouse. (Ab's voice on phone) "Eagle's instructions for the Mouse. "Drive to the covered lot on Bizet Avenue. "Transfer the money to a yellow Volvo with a bicycle. "The key is on the left front wheel. "Drive south on motorway 311. There will be a radio in the car for further instructions." [static over radio] (Willem, over radio) Spikes, one kilometer ahead. (Spikes) Driver, slow down. You stop at three orange cones by the side of the road. Listen up, Mouse... drop the money off the bridge on your left. [noise from above] [thuds] (Spikes) Driver. Leave now. Let's go, let's go! Come on! [grunting] (Spikes) I'll get rid of the car. (Cor) Yeah, that's good. We'll see you later. (Cor) Bye. See you at the flat. (Willem) Have a nice bike ride back. (Cor) That's good. Alright. Freezing. Yeah, it's cold. But I don't care. [chuckles] [loud knocking] (man) Police! Open up! Open the door! Police! Now! Open the door! [laughter and cheering] You're a fucking idiot! Hooray! Did we do it? [cheering] Heiny. We got to go get Heiny. You know I'm right. No, no, he's right, he's right. Wait, wait, wait. Guys, okay. We got to finish the job. Let's drive to the shed and we'll let Heineken go. And I like it! Let's do it! (man over radio) Police say the ransom was larger than any paid in modern times. So far no arrests have been made and no suspects have been identified. An unidentified police source said that the kidnappers were likely an established organization, well-funded, highly disciplined and almost certainly foreign. (Heineken) Uhhh... no lunch, no dinner, no lunch... No! No breakfast, no dinner, no lunch... no lunch again... they, um... They've done the deal. That's why we, um... someone big, we've... [frustrated gasp] Shit, something big! Big! Something big must have happened. Ab? Hey, Ab, have you saved some water? I've got four liters of water here. A man can last about a month on four... four liters... [growl] [growls angrily] [tires screech] "Meticulous planning", that's you, buddy. Behind us. [happy chatter] Behind us. Wait, what's going on? [tires screech] (Spikes) What are you doing? We're being followed. Have a look. It's the police. Those are the cops from the bar. Yeah, I see them. Shit! This is the wrong way! (Willem) I'm going to try and lose them. Shit. (Brakes) We almost got hit. He turned off. Turn left! Turn left! (Spikes) Shit. What do we do? What are we going to do? (Willem) They don't know where the money is. So, Cor, how long we got before they do? (Spikes) Come on. Let's go! Where? To dig up the money for Christ's sake! All five of us? In this car? Yeah! Yeah? And then what? Then what? Well, I don't know! What do you got? What have you got? Come on, think. Alright, I'm thinking... Come on, come on! Alright, alright! I think me and Willem go and we get the money. The five of us can't stay in this car so Willem and I are going to ditch the car and then we dig up the money. Then I think what, we meet you guys in four hours? The boatyard. Out at Newlake. That's good, that's good. (Cat) Meantime, I'm going to let Heineken go. No, we can't be worrying about Heineken. There's no point in worrying about him now. Fucking go! Go! (Willem) Where are you doing? I'm coming with you. Better get out before I break your fucking neck. Just be careful. Don't go home. Promise me. Okay. Okay. Fuck you. [engine starts] (Spikes) What's the time? What's the time? It's ten past. They're not here. They are not here. They took all our money. Did you knock on the door? No, I didn't fucking knock on the door. Why should I knock on the door? Where are their cars? They're not here. Hey. Hey, come in. Yeah, what's wrong with him? What's right with him? Here. Shit, that's way too much. Now come on, you deserve it. Here, come here. I want to talk to you. What's up? I want you to take this money and I want you to hide it in the next 20 minutes. Yeah, but I'll come with you, right? No. What do you mean? Listen, you'll be fine. Look, I love you. Which means I want what's best for you. Now you listen to what I've got to say. Alright? Okay, good. You'll be fine. You take this, [voice breaks] and you make life work for you, alright? Go on. Go on, get the fuck out of here! You'll find me, yeah? Yeah, of course. You promise? Yeah, yeah, yeah. (Cat) Brakes is right. (Spikes) About what? [grunt] (Cat) Money's too heavy. We had to leave a sack in that drum. You did what? (Willem) Oh, come on. You didn't even notice. Look at this, look! You didn't even notice! (Spikes) You left it in the ground? Seven fucking million? Yeah, we'll get the rest when we come back. Come back? I have a friend, they live in Paris. We're going... We're going to stay there until everything's calmed down. Well, I can't. What do you mean? I can't stay in fucking Paris. Cor, I got a family. I got kids. What about Mr. Heineken? Mr. Heineken! Answer me! You let Heineken out now they will grab you, man. If we don't, he'll fucking die. Well, once we get to Paris, we can call his people, tip them off. If they find him in Cat's shed, then we can't ever go back. Think about that? Come on, think about it! Jesus, man. You leave half your brain out in that whole with the rest of my money? It's safe. It's fucking safe! It'll never be safe. It's safe! No! Don't you get it, Cor? It'll never be safe. Not here. Not in Paris. We're lucky if we can hang out in Timbuktu. Take your fucking money, take it! Take it! We were worth a lot more than that. I'll see you on the outside. What about you? Coming with us? Yeah, I'll come. [siren wailing] (Cat) Shit. Halt! Can you hear me, Ab? Wherever you are. Ah. Come on, John. Sing with me, get your mind off all this rubbish. Any song, what is it? Toe bone's connected to the foot bone  (Heineken, on machine) Leg bone's connected to the knee bone  Knee bone's connected to the thigh bone  Thigh bone's connected to the hip bone  Hip bone's connected to the backbone  [door opening] Are you the police? What the hell took you so long? I'm alright. Just my friend, Ab, my chauffeur, go and get him, please. That's it, go and get him! Ab, it's over! (Heineken) He's in there! Ab, you okay? It's over! It's over! Are you okay, sir? Jesus Christ, it's over! Oh, God! [growling] Fuck. Ah. Oh, thank you, God. Ab, you... Oh. [weeping] Thank you, God. (man over radio) Kidnapped billionaire, Alfred Heineken, has been rescued in a police raid earlier this evening. Both Heineken and his driver, Ab Doderer, were found in a shed in the outskirts of Amsterdam. They were apparently unharmed... (Spikes) I don't know. Maybe it was the ransom note we left in the copier. Or all that Bang Bang chicken or maybe... Listen, I'm not saying he did, but... maybe Brakes could have said something... Wait, wait, wait. What did you say? I'm not saying Brakes did, I'm just saying... Yeah, no, no, I hear what you're saying. Maybe you all thought he was fucking you, did you think about that? (radio) ...details of the rescue... Ah, fuck. These are horse blankets. So? So what? I'm allergic. I stop breathing. You promise? I'm sick of you complaining! [shouting] (Cor) Alright, just calm down! [shouting continues] What the fuck? [braking] [shouting continues] (Cor) Just fucking stop it! Look, just stop it...! [angry shouting] (Willem) Get out of my car! (Cor) Just take it easy! Take it easy! Hold it together! Listen. This fucking car...! [shouting] Look, just hold it together! You want your money? Take your money. Calm the fuck down. We haven't got time for this shit! You, get in the car. No way. Not me! I'm out of here! Spikes, get in the fucking car. Let him go. Spikes. Fuck him. Come on. Can't even pick up his bag. Spikes. Spikes! Come on, Cor. Look, Spikes! You're not going to make two fucking miles! I'll make 10,000. Come on, Cor. Come with me. What are you doing? Let him have the car. You're not going to make it without us. Just get in the car, alright? You stay with that asshole, he'll get you killed. Come on, Spikes! Look, Spikes! Oh, fuck it. (officers speaking French) [siren] [siren wailing] Fuck! (speaking French over TV) [Willem speaking in phone booth] [laughing] Okay, bye. This evening. She's going to meet us this evening. Are you sure she's cool? Oh, she's cool. Listen, I think I'm going to call Sonja. You leave my sister out of this. Look, I won't be long. Wait. No, I'm serious. You put her in this shit and they're going to know where we are. I've got to make sure she's all right. Alright, fine. Well, you make the call... I'm out of here. Seriously, you're on your own. Alright. Come on. Let's go. What's this place like, anyway? It's, uh, it's nice. But it's safe. That's all that matters. [doorbell rings] Forget about it. Come back! I'm coming. Hi. Hey. I'm going to make some coffee. (Willem) What's going on? Front page. Spikes turned himself in. "God told me to burn the money." Ha. He's insane. Or he's smart. He's going to do 15 years at least. Well, that's one way to play it. You think you could play it like that? No, God doesn't talk to me that much. Oh, yeah. He looks like an idiot. [chuckles] (interviewer) Mr. Heineken, it's been over two months since you were released. Looking back, what was your biggest fear? (Heineken) My biggest fear was for my driver, Ab Doderer. Because he suffered most... and we both knew who was really expendable. (reporter) Did they ever threaten to kill you? I honestly believe that they believed it was a business deal, nothing more. Where do you think Cor Van Hout and Willem Holleeder are now? It doesn't matter. As the great fighter Joe Louis used to say, "You can run but you cannot hide." We'll get them. Thank you. Hm. I'm going to have to phone Sonja. You can't do that. [shouting] I told you, you can't do that. [lively chatter between Willem and girl] (Cor) What about that one? Huh? That one's perfect. (Sonja) What about it? Well, you know, it's got those tall windows that you like. I bet it's got a big backyard for the kid. If we're buying fancy houses, we might as well buy one for Willem next door, otherwise I'll never see either of you. Now he can buy his own. You're never even going to try to live in the real world, are you? [phone ringing] Yeah, hello. (Cor, over phone) Karin, look, it's me. Don't hang up. Cor? Now, listen to me. I'm going to give you a number and I need you to tell Sonja to call me as soon as she can. From a phone box some way over from the house. You understand? Where are you? Listen to me. Listen to me, please. Promise me, look, it's for her. [phone rings] Hello? (Sonja, over phone) What did you do, Cor? What the hell did you do? Don't start that now, we haven't got time for that. Look, there's no time... Cor, what the hell did you do? Cor, where are you? Answer me, Cor. Where...? Cor? Cor? Where...? Where are you? Sonja? Son... Sonja, are you there? Sonja, Sonja! I'm here. I'm here, Cor. Cor, Cor, this is... they follow me everywhere. I know. I just wanted to hear your voice. If I buy a loaf of bread, they check my money in case it's... I want to be where you are. Please. Soon, Son, soon. Listen, after the baby, I can come back, alright? Soon. That's a promise. You promise? I promise. I promise, I promise, I promise. Listen to me, okay, Son, listen? We're going to be a real family. You know? We'll be a real family and I'm going to give you everything you ever wanted. And believe me. Huh, you believe me? I believe you. But Cor, do you know how big this thing is? They've arrested everybody you ever met in your life. They bugged all the phones. Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean everyone? Like Arthur and my parents, Your parents? all your friends, all of mine, everybody's. Cor, I've got to go. I love you. Okay? Be safe. No, don't hang up! Don't hang up! Son, don't hang up! I love you! [click] L, uh... I think I messed up. I think they have this number... since last night. Just letting you know. [sigh] We better get our stuff then. (Cor) Willem, wait. Something feels wrong. It seems too quiet. [speaking French over radio] You want to do this? You know, I think I'll sit this one out. In prison? Look, we can get out while we're still young. They'll never find the money. [speaking French over radio] You want to bet? You know I do. (speaking French) (Heineken, off) There are two ways a man can be rich in this world. He can have a lot of money... or he can have a lot of friends. But he cannot have both.
