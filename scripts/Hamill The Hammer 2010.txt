That's it, huh? I've seen enough to determine a conclusive result. After a couple of flashing lights and a teddy bear, you're gonna tell me my grandson is deaf and dumb? No. After a couple of flashing lights and a teddy bear, I'm going to tell you you have a highly intelligent grandson who's profoundly deaf. Interacting with other deaf children will really help. You should consider sending him to a residential school and having him learn sign language. I know it's difficult. Matt's not going to some deaf school. He's going to Loveland Elementary, just like his brother. Let's go, Janet. Dad, I want to know what our options are. I know this seems overwhelming, but millions of people have gone through this. You're not alone. You add a seven, and then you can make... Right? Should add that one there. Nice. Great. All right, time for recess. Let's all line up. Matt. It's time for recess. Time for recess. Recess. We're lining up. Get him! Get him! Tackle him! Hike! Did you hear that one coming, deafy? Oome on! Why's your brother such a retard? Wah... Wah-te. Wah-de. Wah-de. Wah... wah... Dad? Yeah? I've been, uh, reconsidering the residential school idea for Matt. Or at least some sign language classes. He's fine. Okay, boys. Pat, you drive for a minute. Okay. Hey, big boy. - Wa-ter. - Wah... - Wa-ter. - Wah-uh. Wa-wa-wa-ter. Wa-uh. Wa-ter. That's good! Yes. Yes. Wa-ter. - Wa-du. - Wa-ter. Wa-du. - Wa-wa-ter. - Wa-du. Good boy. Good boy. There we go. He's a great kid, Mike, but since the divorce, things have been tough. I know he could be a good wrestler. Hey, you need something, buddy? Nah, he's fine. We've just been working on his speech. Really? Hmm? Look, Stan, I don't think this is gonna work out. I mean, it's tough enough with the kids I have, you know? How's the fam holding up? How's Janet doing? What are you asking, Mike? I was just wondering. If she's available? Well... is she? Ooach. - Ooach. - Ooa. Ooach. Ooa. Ooa. Ooach. Ooach. Ooa. Good. I'll tell Janet you said hello. Everybody hustles out there, okay, guys? Nobody quits. Let's pair up by weight. Let's go. Oome on, guys. - Okay. - Oome on. Martin, I want you to wrestle Matt. Let's go. Okay. Okay, guys. Now, listen. Keep your spacing. I want to see single-leg takedowns. On my whistle, guys. Uhh! Martin. Take it easy on him, okay? All right. Let's do this again. Let's go. Oh, Stanley, what have you gotten me into? Let's try this one more time, okay? And that's where you pin him. Let's go. Did you see that? Let's go! Oome on, guys. Oome on. Oome on. Let's go. Oome on, move! All the way! All the way! All the way! All the way! All right, all right! Give yourself a hand! Nice job! # Oome on down # # To the Oadillac of love # # Oome on down # # You will be back for more... # All right, guys, great practice! Shower up. Greatjob, guys. Good job. Nice job. Good job. All right, all right. Matt, Dale, enough. Good job. Good job. Good job, boys. Good job, guys. Matt. Matt. Greatjob out there. Great technique on those arm throws. Thanks, coach. You need a ride? You need a ride? No. Michelle's taking me. Have you heard from Purdue yet? Not yet. Hey. Tell your mom, Friday night, my turn to cook dinner, okay? Okay. All right. Greatjob. So what are you doing today? What are you doing today? Uh, I've got another wrestling practice to go to. My brother's taking me. Oh, Pat? No his other brother, genius. Shut up. Maybe we should all go on a double date. Yeah, okay. How about you abort the conversation, Viv? How about you tell someone that he smells like b. O? All right. Well, here we are, sir. Just sayin'. Stop. What? It's not like he can hear us anyway. Aw, Matt, I don't know if that's such a great idea. Why? Well, I don't know. I mean, our families have been friends for years. Wouldn't that be kind of weird? You can't dance, right? I mean, you can't hear the music. No, but I can feel the vibration, like this, you know. - No. No. - See? - Look... I'm sorry. Do you still need a ride tomorrow? No. Sorry. Bye, Matt. A note? What is this, fifth grade? Where are those boys? I swear, if they don't quit missing dinners, I'm gonna quit making 'em. Matt's picking up some extra practice over at Kenston. Pat gave him a ride. I wanted to wait till Matt got home, but take a look. A full ride to Purdue? Is this right? Oh, my God. It's one of the best wrestling programs in the nation. Oh, my God. What's this? Uh, it's... R.I.T., another acceptance. But the other one's the one we really care about. Well, I think that we should still consider both options. There's a great deaf school at R.I.T., and he'll really get the support he needs. I'm just worried he'll get lost at Purdue. We don't need a deaf program. Do you even realize how good of a wrestler your son is? He has so much more potential than you give him credit for. He could be a national champion. Well, why don't we let Matt make his own decisions? Hey. Hi, Mom. You hungry? No, I can't. I have to cut weight. I'll eat his dinner. Pat, you don't have to gain weight for him to lose it. In the meantime... I want you to read this letter. Hmm. Scholarship? There's another letter for you. Rochester? It was just a backup. Well, I guess that makes up for the prom rejection, right? You invited somebody to the prom? I have to go study now. What? Get in. Pretty exciting news that came yesterday. Yeah. You given it any more thought? What's there to think about? I'm going to Purdue, don't you think? You know what I think? Why limit yourself when you can compete with the best? That's not what Mom thinks. Your mother has your best interest at heart, always. I want you to remember that. In fact, she's dying to know what happened with Michelle. It's not that big a deal. Prom only happens once. Anything that only happens once is a big deal. I don't think she likes me. Well... if you don't believe in yourself, I'm not going to. Now get outta here. Matt, what are you doing? What time is it? - 6:15! - Shh. I mean, you just decided to run over here and ask me to prom? Yes! You have no idea how loud you're being, do you? No! So will you go with me? Why don't you just ask me properly at school? Okay. So you think you'll say yes? Yes! Yes, I will. Okay? Just... Go. Okay? I'll see you at school. These might be a little bit snug, but they'll do the trick, all right? So... What do you have planned after prom? Early practice for the one I'm missing tonight. Hey. There's more to life than wrestling with dudes. Women... like to wrestle, too. Oh, Matt. Matt! Matt! Matt! How do I look? Perfect. Yeah. Marge, she's gonna be fine. Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Russell. Hi, Michelle. Hi. Oool car. You look real pretty. Thanks. Um, cool tux. Here. I've got it, thanks. Thank you. It's beautiful. Here. Let's get out of here before my mom makes my dad drive us. You want to wear my goggles? What? I can't hear you over the engine. Oh, sorry. Do you want my goggles? You want to wear it? Oh, no, thanks. They look... they look cute on you. I love this car 'cause I can feel the vibrations. Put your feet on the floorboard, close to the engine. Now close your eyes. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Watch out. Watch... Whoo! Are you hungry? Yeah. Yeah. I know the perfect place. Okay. Whew. I love tacos! Welcome to El Parian. Would you like to order our new big and bold beefy buster burrito? You want me to order for you? Fine. What? I said that's fine. Hello? Um... Oould I get two number threes, please? Always get number three. What kind of drinks would you like with that, sir? He wants to know what you want to drink. Two cokes, please. Oome on, hurry the hell up already! What's wrong? Hello? Any day now! Oome on! Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Hang on. Here, with your hair, you could get it way high. What happened to your hair? I'm just gonna use the bathroom. Michelle, I'll wait for you in the hallway. Matt... I... thought... you... should... Please talk normal. I just wanted to let you know that Michelle's mom came to pick her up. She wasn't feeling well, and... and she wanted to tell you herself. I'm sorry, Matt. K-prime equals D-squared-Y over DX-squared. Function Y equals F(X), where X and Y are naturally scaled orthogonal coordinates. Excuse me? Excuse me. Excuse me. Your interpreter's up here for you. Just come on. Okay, now the astringent curvature, K, of a plane curve at a given point on the curve is defined as the derivative of the tangent angle with respect to the position on the curve at that point. ...find that K equals V-cubed over V(X). What is he saying? Excuse me, professor! What did you just say? I can't see his lips. Shuffles. Hamill! Hamill! You're late. Let's go! Shots. Man, it's the first day of practice. Oome on. Gentlemen, we're going to partner up. Two-minute live gos. Hamill, I want you working with Miller. Everybody else grab your training partners. Get a spot on the mat. Let's get moving. Oome on. We're going on my whistle, guys. Let's go. Stay focused, Hamill. Miller, back up. Let's get up, guys. Let's go. Get back up. Miller pins Hamill again. Where's your head at, son? Thanks for coming in. No problem, coach. Here's the thing, I understand that your handicap is something... I'm not handicapped. Your record's 6 and 8, Matt. I know that, sir, but... I've been working really hard. And your GPA, it's below the minimum required for the scholarship. I can get it up. I'm sorry. This wasn't an easy decision. I came here to win a national championship, sir. I know I can do it. This is the Big Ten. Don't take it personally. Matt. Hey, back in good ol' Loveland, huh? Good to see you. So, uh, my truck. Every time I pull up to a stop sign, she stalls out. I don't know what's wrong with her. - Strange. - Hi, Matt. Hi. You remember my wife, Michelle, right? So, uh... When should I call about the truck? Tomorrow afternoon. All right. We'll call you tomorrow. Honey, I'll be out in just a second, okay? So, um... shouldn't you be at Purdue? Not anymore. Michelle, I want to apologize for ruining your prom. Matt, don't be silly. No. It's... It's something I think about. I wish I can do it over. Well, l... I think we all know how that feels. You still love tacos? Oongratulations. You'll be a great mother. Thank you. It's funny how things turn out, huh? I never pictured you as a mechanic. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's just I always saw you somewhere else doing something different. Thought for sure you'd make it out of here. Anyway, um, I should get going. It was good to see you, Matt. Well, Matt, who was that? Girlfriend? Huh? Girlfriend? She's a hottie, eh? She was a hottie, yo. Didn't tell me you had a bun in the oven, buddy. Huh? What's the matter with you, huh? Why do you think you have the right to feel sorry for yourself? Don't pretend you understand what it's like to be me. You always have, but you have no idea. You lookin' for a pity party? I failed at Purdue. So what? I went there for you. Hey, I never lied to you, boy. I told you your whole life that you don't need to be treated different. But I am different. That doesn't mean you're any worse off than anyone else. The world can be cruel, no matter who you are. No one is exempt from that. But if you still want a chance at an education and a national championship, then you're gonna have to stop feeling sorry for yourself, roll up your sleeves and get back to work! Your mom convinced me, and we've done some rearranging. We're gonna send you to R.I.T. This fall. I'm not going anywhere. We're gonna refinance the house to pay for the first year. R.I.T. Said they'd consider a scholarship after that. I don't want your money. Get in the truck. I'll be back in a minute. Roll out the mat. What are you laughing at? What are you doing? Oh, so you don't think I can take you, huh? Grandpa, don't be ridiculous. Boy, I don't want any excuses. You worry about yourself. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. You see how much you gotta learn? #... Stars surround the universe # # S-Spinnin' out of control # # First the comets in my head # # I remember what you said # # And feel that's one with my soul... # because you're... big... bald... black? Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! Nice to meet you. Sorry I barged in. Jay told me that he'd be getting a new roommate soon, but I was starting to think the school couldn't find anyone who could stand to live with him. Hey, give me back my shorts, lunatic. Jay. Jay. Jay. Jay. Hello, Jay? Turn down the music. Funny. It's funny. It's really funny. Next time, I'm not gonna give you a warning. I'm gonna write you up. Yeah. No, thanks. I'll stay and, um, unpack. Maybe I should move up to 190. Sorry. I have not been around many deaf people. I was the only deaf person in my town. I'm only here for one thing, national championship. No, thanks. I'm only here for one thing. Ladies. We've been practicing now for one month to see who's got what it takes to become or remain a part of this team. He gives the same speech every year. Nick. Give me 50. Today... we decide... who our starters will be for each weight class. Lose today, lose your spot. And I don't care if you're a senior. I don't care if you're Randy "Macho Man" Savage, you understand? You understand?! Yes, coach! No excuses. Ooach, who's up first? Ooach! Uh, 190s! Oome on. Pick it up! Shake hands. Wrestle. Yeah! Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! All right, coach, who's next? Uh, 167 s! Let's go! Rezac. Rezac! All right, last chance for 167 s. Yeah, it is. Rezac! Looks like someone wants a shot at the team captain. You got this. Hey! Wrestle! Two! Takedown. Time! Near fall. Three. Five, Rezac. Hamill, zero. You're up. You're down. Wrestle! Reversal! Two. Pin! Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!

I'm gonna talk to him for a sec. Hey, you know why he beat you, right? I ran out of time. No. He had a strategy, scoring points. Yeah, but time ran out before I could... Pin him? You don't have to pin everyone you wrestle. The goal is to win, right? Takedown, reversal... two points. Escape... one point. Near fall... two or three points. Ooach, I know all this. Doesn't matter. I know I can pin him. Even the best wrestlers, they can't pin quality opponents most of the time. You don't have to pin, just have to win. Okay? Hey. Pair up with Stephan. What's your point? No, it is, Kristi. I'm doing this for you. What happened? Oome on, let's go get some coffee. Okay. Dad... show Matt what you learned. Pat, we should go. Oome on. Hi, Grandpa. Hey. You won last week. Not bad. You did it, huh? Not yet. National championship's not till next week. You're signing? Join them. I love you, too, Grandpa. I don't need anyone's help. Kristi. Where is he?! Where is he? There he is! Look who decided to show back up! Look who decided... Ooach! I can't understand you! Oantrell! Where the hell is Oantrell? Tell this little piss-ant that if he has the nerve to disappear, not return our phone calls, then cha-cha-cha back here like nothing happened... Ooach, his grandfatherjust died. I just heard myself. Grandfather. Matt, this school and the athletic department has very stern rules, one of which is if you miss more than three consecutive practices, then you're unable to participate in the following match. Ooach! It's the Nationals! Exactly, which is why I had to spend the entire week covering for you with the athletic director. You should have called, you know, kept us in the loop. You might think the world revolves around you, Matt, but what you don't understand is that wrestling's also a team sport. Fix this chalkboard, Oantrell. And meet me in my office! # I guess nothing goes # # Just how you plan # # But it made me strong # # Made me a man # # When I'm looking back someday # # I won't have one complaint # # Took life as it came # # Made some pretty good lemonade # # Nobody knows # # When the time will come # # Hope you can say... # # That you had some fun # # When I'm looking back someday # # I won't have one complaint # # Took life as it came # # Made some pretty damn good lemonade # Hi.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 1997 Division 3 NOAA Wrestling Ohampionship. We've got a great crowd here today at R.I.T. - Whoo! - Yeah! - Whoo! Oome on now! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! - R.I. T! - Out of bounds! Ah, that's good. Good. That's good. Have a venti, huh? Ride him! Ride him! Ride him! Ride him! Yeah! Open your eyes! What? Are you kidding me?! Jay Jakubowski of R.I.T. Ioses by disqualification. Are you crazy? Ooach, that was his fourth violation. Hey, genius, he's deaf! Maybe he didn't hear you, huh? Ooach, here's your warning. Unsportsmanlike conduct. Give me a break! Oome on! Oome on, buddy. Yeah! Yeah, buddy! Yeah! Yeah! With the semi-final round completed, we will now move into the final matches for each weight class. So... Here we are. Seems certainly fitting that this is how it's coming to a close. Jason Sloan, two-time national champ, against Matt Hamill. Whoever wins tonight will forever be called a champion. For Sloan, well, he's looking to be called a three-time national champion. That's what's at stake for him. That's how bad he wants it. And the only thing standing in the way of everything this guy has ever worked for... is a sophomore walk-on. So what's at stake for Mr. Hamill? Winning the national championship, no doubt. That's not really it, is it? When you guys go back in that gymnasium, I want you to look in the stands. I want you to look in the crowd... because those are the stakes. If your hand is raised at the end of the match, not only will you be called a champion, but I guarantee you'll have inspired thousands of others to do the same. All right?! All right! Let's bring it in, guys! Oome on! Matt Hamill, a sophomore walk-on out of R.I.T., is set to take on Jason Sloan, two-time national champion, out of Frampton, for the 167-pound national title. Hamill... you got this. It's up to you now. Good luck. Orowd, chanting: R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! R.I. T! - Oome on, man. - R.I. T! R.I. T! Oome on, Matt! Whoo! Hamill's had a great first season here, but hasn't come close to facing a wrestler with Sloan's ability and consistency. Regardless, they both look ready to go, and this should prove to be an exciting match-up. And we're under way. Both wrestlers seem to be feeling each other out here. That's it, Matt. Oome on. Hamill keeping some good wrist control. Take him! Oome on! Oome on, baby! Oome on! Let's go! Oome on! Oome on, Matt! You got him. Both wrestlers are really on top of their game here. Ah, Sloan tries a shot there, but Hamill's not having it. Oome on! Here you go! Oradle! Two. Takedown green! Two-nothing, Sloan. Lock his head! Lock his head! - Lock his head! - Oome on, Matt. There you go! Oome on, Matt! Lock it in! Lock it in! Lock it in! Lock in the head! And now he's throwing in his legs, probably gonna try his power half. Oome on! Go for it! Drive it down! Drive it down! Pin him! Oome on! There you go! And out of time. Back to the middle, guys. Well, Hamill got lucky there. He didn't give up any back points. Oome on, Matt! Let's go! Oome on! So now we're going into the second period with Sloan at two, Hamill zero. And here's the coin toss. Green, your choice. Top, bottom, neutral or defer? Green defers. Red... top, bottom, or neutral? Red takes down. Taking the bottom. Let's go, Matt. Taking the bottom. Let's go, Matt! Here we go. Hamill obviously trying for an escape or a reversal. He's up. Oome on! And out of bounds, no points. Back to the middle. Red still down. Top man on. Okay, they're resetting. Sloan still in top position. Lock his head! Oome on, Matt. Lock his head! There you go! Sloan's still dominating Hamill on the ground. Lock it up! Gets him on his back. Hamill gets back to his base, but gives up two back points. Hamill with a Gramby roll out of nowhere! That gets Hamill on the board with one escape point. Oome on. Keep it going! Take control of him now! Oome on! Oome on! - Oome on. - Get back in there! Oome on! Take control of him! Go! Hamill still trails by three as this period is coming to an end. Work something! Oome on! Oome on, Jason! He's yours now! You can do it. Oome on. Whoa, a double-leg from Sloan! That's it! You got him! Yeah! That's it! No, no! Oome on, call that! Hamill looks hurt. All right. Injury time. Injury time? Are you nuts?! That's a toss, man! What are you talking about? Ooach, I didn't see it that way. Are you crazy?! Oome on, that's a slam, and you know it! Ooach, that's not a slam. Oome on! You know that's a slam! Get back to your corner. Oome on, you little punk! Let it go. Ohampion, my ass! I got unsportsmanlike, - R.I.T. Red. - Give me a break! You're a bum! Ooach! - You're a chump! - You're gone. Now Gross is ejected. Hate to see that, especially now. Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Stop the injury clock! Matt Hamill is up. Looks like, yes. I don't believe what I'm seeing here. Yes. He's going to continue. Matt "The Hammer" Hamill brought back up to his feet. Ooach Oantrell is now filling in for Gross. Your choice. Green selects bottom. And here we go. The third and final period. All right! Oome on! Oome on! Oome on! Hamill here really struggling to keep Sloan down. Oh, he's looking for the half. He let it go. He's going for the cradle now. Oome on, Matt. Hamill lets Sloan up. Another point for Sloan. One, green, escape! One, green! That puts Hamill down four. Good, good! All right, he's gonna have to pull out all the stops here in the final minutes. Let's go. I love you, Matt. Oome on. Pick it up. Three, near fall, red! Three, red! Yes! Unbelievable! He pulled it off! He got the takedown! He got the near fall! And Matt Hamill wins by decision, six to five. Matt "The Hammer" Hamill has dethroned Jason Sloan! Yes! Yeah! There he is, Matt Hamill, your 167-pound national champion. Ha! I love you! I love you! I love you. Way to go, champ! # When I close my eyes # # I see ahead # # What I held inside until I bled # # But, Mama, don't feel bad because I bleed # # You already gave me all I need # Ladies and gentlemen, this fight is three rounds in the UFO light heavyweight division.
