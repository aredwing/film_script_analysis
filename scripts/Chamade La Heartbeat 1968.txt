You mean she's up at this hour? She was down in the kitchen before I was. She took an orange and said she'd be leaving before you... that you'd be meeting her later. Only an orange? Yes. She asked me to tell you to breathe deeply... before you go out, because spring is in the air. Why did you go out so early this morning? I was worried. But you know nothing ever happens to me. That is, nothing but good things. What about letting me in on your secret? You know very well it simply doesn't exist. That's marvelous. For you, the world is an oyster. For me, it's more complicated. Very complicated. Do you mind? Excuse me. I wasn't watching. Charles, is it really true... that you've installed a croquet lawn... in your apartment for Lucille's exclusive use? It's my house, not my apartment... and besides, Lucille's play doesn't need improving. With me, it's just the opposite. My play needs constant attention. Otherwise... Your feet should be further apart. Much further than that. Further, darling. Look, my feet are just fine this way. Impossible. You'll miss the ball. -I'm not going to! -That's enough from you. -Just you watch-- -Johnny! Can't you see Lucille needs to concentrate? We all know how good you are. Who's got the blue ball? The blue one belongs to Antoine. But who's Antoine? -It's me. -Come on, Lucille. Play. She's libel to take all day. It's no good. -Who's next? -I think it's you. -Who, me? -Yes, you, Antoine. I can't bear being a loser. -I'm a terrible loser myseIf. -It's one of those things. -Did you see that? -Not bad at all. Look there. You see that? -She's in for it. -The gent himseIf. What a nasty thing to do! Oops, sorry. I bet you are. ls it my turn now or not? -That was deliberate. -No. -Liar. -Well, maybe so. But, darling, a sporting man should at least... go into the pool after it, don't you think? Come on, everyone. lsn't it about time... you stopped for a breather? My roast is ready. Johnny, Francois, time for lunch! Here, leave that outside. -Start from scratch. -Go over it in the morning. -All right. Good-bye. -See you tomorrow. Diane, now listen, how many times... have I begged you not to come for me with the car? It's pretty embarrassing. all my friends go home by subway, don't they? But they don't have the same advantages you do... and besides I'm sick of you and your scruples. If you prefer, I can wait for you... on a street corner with a bicycle. It's not a matter of scruples. It's a principle. In deference to your principles... just which hash-house are we going to eat in? We're skipping dinner for the theater... on a pass I got out of Devigny. But that means I've got to change. I'm not going with you with that tie. No time to change. Besides, no one cares. Let's go. Let her roll. Bet you're jealous. I can't believe it. It's fun. Look, there's Diane! Diane! -How are you, darling? -Hello, darling. -How are you? -How do you do? -Good evening. -How nice to see you again. You're looking well. Good evening. -Good evening. -Evening, Lucille. You're picnicking. What a good idea. -Evening. -Evening. Just like being in the country. Antoine, be an angel. I'm out of cigarettes. He's rather interesting. But so are all my friends. I don't know a soul who isn't. There aren't any other people for you, are there? Have you know him long? Yes, we've known each other for years. Through your friends or family? It's my turn now. Come on. Let's go. -No, no. -So do I. Anyone hungry? Why don't we all go out to the Cheval Noir? -Such a divine little place. -Just this side of Versailles. Lovely, lovely. What a bright idea. -all right, follow us. -Charming little place. Diane, would you mind if I went with you? We arrived in Lucille's convertible. I must have got a chill. Tonight, I feel like Methuselah with a cold coming on. Antoine can go with Lucille. Yes, of course. Don't drive too fast, Antoine. Do you have room enough for us, Diane? Certainly. Wonderful. I can't find the keys. They were in my purse. I must have lost them in the theater. Whoops. So that's where they were. Why do you do that? Aren't we going on? When may I see you again? Charles! Why did you leave me alone with Antoine? What did you say? Why would you leave me alone with Antoine? Because I thought he'd amuse you. So you'd push me into the arms of anyone who'd amuse me? Don't be so upset. I don't think it's a good sign. That's not what I meant to say. But I can't bear it. I'll never be accommodating. I assure you, that's one thing I'm not. I just wanted to find out something. That's all. You wanted to find out what? How you looked when you came into the restaurant. Yes, that's all. Your way of not looking at him. That attitude, thoughtful, terribly gentle... and almost resigned. The way you look when you're attracted to someone. And so? Is there any harm in my being attracted to someone? No. I can't accept that. You can't expect me to. What you do with your freedom when you're... I don't do a thing with my freedom. You know very well I love you. I've never asked you to give up your freedom. You're attracted by him. Well, follow through with it or not... whether I know or not. It's true. I like him. But it can't be very serious since we're talking about it. The key's in the door. Hello, Antoine. Hello. I hope you haven't read all these. No I haven't. Excuse me. You look happy. Are you enjoying the party? It's marvelous, with autumn on one hand... and spring on the other. Everything's just fine. What a poetic expression to use. You've never seen the place, have you? -Not really. -Come along then. This is the dining room. That's stunning. What it does for the face is sheer flattery, you've no idea. It looks like a sea creature. It's different, isn't it? I love it. How come? You can hardly make it out. It's a minor work. I'll show you the rest. Go ahead. I'm right behind you. This is the patio. That's delightful. That's Diana the Huntress, isn't it? My husband always loved horses. It's very nice. And what kind of animal is that? A toucan. Look, a De Stal, and a lovely one. Antoine, he was so late, he changed here. Why are men so completely disorganized? Charles is always so tidy. Did you notice? I'm very proud of the Foujita. Don't you think it's gorgeous? I'm mad about his work. -I understand that. -Tell me what you think. It's wonderful to have a terrace. Yes, but if you know the headaches I've had... with the decorator and the builders. Of course, I've only been living here a little while. -You see? It's lovely. -Yes, it is. What a mess. I mean, really! Your party tonight is a smashing success. Whenever Claire begins acting somewhat perverse... you know it's a good party. It's true. How observant. That's very surprising because... I've always thought that you seemed a bit-- -a bit muddled? -Exactly. Do you have a son? No, it's my nephew. What are you doing here? Destre wants to see you. I'm showing the apartment to Lucille... and while I'm at it, I'm straightening out your things... because you're such a disorganized creature. What about my things? Let's not exaggerate-- a tie of yours, a razor. Wouldn't you be annoyed with a mess like this? We don't have the same room, Charles and I. There you are. I wanted to show you something. I'm curious to know what it is. Let me get a refill. Did you ever wonder what the artist's political views are? I'm frightened by you. By me? You intrigue me. You'll laugh at it, but you intrigue me. No, I'm not laughing of you. You're only interested in the things that please you. Am I right? Don't be ashamed of it. Good evening. Lovely to see you. No, it's admirable. In this friendly group... it's the best means of staying sane... a moment or two longer. Thank You. But I am fond of you, too. Be careful. Happiness like yours could be dangerous. Not at all. I'm always in a good mood in charming company. -That's water. -That's right. Excuse me, will you? Paul's been signaling. I'm sorry. You seem happy. Yes. Why, you're not? No. That's where I'm different. I can't stand phony situations. Wait. Surely you don't expect me to fly apart... just because I found one of your ties here? Especially since it's one of your awful ones. Though against all that white, I thought it looked natural... You'll be in Charles' arms in an hour. No, I won't. I'll be alone. Anyhow, you won't be with me. It was so awful when you walked in. I blushed like a schoolgirl. I couldn't bring myseIf to look at you. I was shaking. So was I. But I feel much better now. In fact, I feel wonderful. Almost like someone in love. It's only water. What in the world have you two been telling each other? If it was as amusing, tell me about it, too. I adore funny stories. I think it's just something silly. Then you ought to come out with it to amuse us. But I've forgotten it by now. That's what's so funny. Antoine, you tell it, or shouldn't we ask? One should never ask those things. Do you think so? Charles, I've had too much to drink. That's ok. Shall we go home then? I believe that would be really sensible. What is it? I think we'd better go home right now. -You've had that much to drink? -Yes. I'm all right. You haven't said a word, Charles... and I know what that means. You want to follow me into my room tonight... but at five o'clock, Antoine held me in his arms... and at five tomorrow, he will again. I can't think of anyone else holding me. Not even you, Charles. And God knows how much I love--I like you. I'm so happy, I could... I have a bit of a headache. Remind me to take an aspirin when we get home so I can sleep. Roll up your window. You'll catch pneumonia. No, I won't. The fresh air does me good. I'm afraid of losing you, Lucille. I'm in a constant state of desire and panic... like some poor, unhappy animal. I've got to make a trip to New York. Why don't you come with me this time? Why not? How long will you be gone? A week or two. New York's lovely in the spring. We've only been there in the winter together. Doesn't do it justice. No, it's not possible. Two weeks away from Antoine. l'd trade all the cities in the world for his room. -Good afternoon. -Afternoon. -How have you been? -all right. Something I can get you? Not right now. You're looking very chipper. You don't happen to have seen-- No, he hasn't been in... but I have an extra key, if you like. He always leaves it here. Just bring it back. Hello? I'm afraid that there's something wrong with my phone. There's a call. I-- Boss' fault. He kept us two hours longer. I was afraid you'd be gone by now. Talk, talk. I thought you'd be angry. I was afraid I'd let you down. You know what? I'm afraid I'm in love. That's great. So am I. Don't forget about the flowers in her room. My suitcase packed? I only have some shirts to put in it. And send me a postcard. You know I collect them. Here. Take this. And go to the bank? That's the way to get money. Did you have a good day? A very good day. -Charles? -Yes? -I'm frightened. -Of what? That I've been missing out on life... or at least what life is supposed to be. Charles, should one have a passion? A job you're involved in... to earn a living, to prove you exist? I'm sure there are more important things. Just as long as you're happy. Is happiness enough? Absolutely. But... What? What were you going to say? It doesn't matter. Your involved metaphysical reflections... give you a more muddled air than usual. That's what you always say. You're right. When's your flight leaving? The plane leaves at eight. I'd much rather not go at all. Well, what do you think? Whatever you say. Your heart beats so fast. Are you very tired? No. It's the "Chamade." I don't understand. What's the "Chamade"? I'm not sure what it means. We'll look it up tonight in the dictionary. Cut it out. Stop fooling around. Martha? You're on a first-name basis with her? -She's over sixty. -I don't believe you. Martha, it's Antoine. The alarm clock never woke me up. Look, tell Mr. Cordier that I'm on my way. OK? Thanks. That was childish, I know, but he pays the bills. -I can't afford to annoy him. -No. Do you earn a lot of money? No, I've got a pretty interesting job... but I don't earn very much. Why do you ask? Is it important for you? No, but it's convenient to have money, that's all. By convenient, do you mean that it's important? What are all the questions for? Because...I intend to live with you... so I'll have to take care of you. I'm able to take care of myseIf. It's not as if I had never worked. I worked a year on "Appeal," a magazine, but it folded. It was pleasant work. Not much money, but-- No, you know very well what I mean. I want you to live right here with me. I won't be able to give you the same advantages you've had... so you have to choose. What about Charles? Well, it's Charles or me. -You've got to choose. -But why? Charles comes back day after tomorrow. That's right. Day after tomorrow, you either come here for good... or we won't see each other anymore. There you are. It's simple. Charles, we've been together for two years. No, three years.. I can't believe-- Yes, three years. For three marvelous years-- And I don't have to tell you... that my feelings are deep and profound. You know that. And because that's true, I can't bring myseIf to lie about this. Then again, I could just say the simple truth. Charles, forgive me. I love Antoine. I wouldn't mind staying with you... but Antoine is terribly jealous. No. What I'll have to do is to tell him here... when he's past the gate. I might not be able to later. No. I'll simply say, "Charles"... Flight number 801, coming from New York, will be delayed. A delay of how long? What does that mean? Is anything wrong? I mean the flight from New York. We know no more than that. It may be the weather conditions. But it could be dangerous. Of course not. Don't worry. Is anything wrong, miss? Please, leave me alone. Passengers arriving on flight may be met at Gate 34. Charles! Oh, Charles! I thought the plane crashed. No, it was nothing. Really. The pilot had trouble with the motors. And you, how are you? all right. Antoine, I went to the airport. I'd even practiced what to say, I swear it. Then, because his flight was delayed, I... Just the thought of him dead, the way I've been behaving... Though he seemed dead every minute we were together. Antoine, it's me. Things haven't turned out so well. Did you talk to Charles? No. I mean, that's why I'm calling. I don't want to hear from you till you've told him everything. Happy birthday, Johnny. There's not much more room in here. That's all right. Let us in. Just a second. Step into my parlor. I love your place. Happy birthday, Johnny. Thanks, Charles. I'm delighted you could come. -Terrific butler, he has. -She's divine. You know everybody. Just make yourselves at home. -Don't worry about us. -You know where the drinks are. You know Estelle, I believe. That's marvelous! He always was a practical joker! What I can't stand... Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. You're looking well. How are you, dear? -Good evening. -How are you? -Evening. -Nice to see you. Lucille, don't run off like that. Lovely dress you've got on, dear. Oh, really? I'm glad that you think so. Both in black. That's a good sign. I wore black tonight because it makes me cheerful. -Why, Lucille, hello. -How are you, Claire? It's been a while, darling. How have you been? My dear, what fabulous earrings you're wearing. I've never seen you wear them. Charles went on a buying spree in New York. Not bad. Wasn't that worth waiting for? Everyone gather round. It's time that I blew out the candles. You'll all help me out... because my wind's not what it used to be. We're all with you! Happy birthday, dear. Best wishes, Johnny. tell him happy birthday. I mustn't leave anyone out. They'd be jealous. He's blushing! Look at that! You sweetheart. Do I get to kiss you, too, Charles? all right. You can give me a kiss. Just what are you doing to us? Nothing. Don't expect me to be quiet, not any longer. I won't keep on lying. The whole thing's too much for me. tell me, Lucille... ever since Charles got here... You'd like to know if we slept together. Of course. He brought me a gift, didn't he? Come on. You don't realize what you're saying. No, but you seem to have, and you said it. Come on. Let's dance. -No. -Well, you're going to. No, I'm not going to. I told you I'm not going to dance! -I want to talk to you! -Leave me alone! That's enough of this nonsense, you hear? It's a hesitation waltz. You wouldn't force Lucille to dance with you? Why not spend a few weeks in Venice? Alone or with me. The Mediterranean cures all. You said so. The Mediterranean. You've been here long? Quite a while. I'm all worn out, Diane. What happened to your cheek? A misunderstanding with someone. Not a bad guy. We made up for it at the bar. What are you looking at? Just looking, that's all. I've only been up here twice. You said it was more comfortable at your place. You're implying the past tense, Antoine. Don't let it worry you, Diane. You're perfect... even at this hour. Well, thanks. You seemed to be in a great big hurry a while ago. May I know the reason why? Yes. I'm in love with Lucille. You mean you're her lover? Here? Yes, every afternoon. Don't you think maybe you might have told me earlier? I wasn't sure. I was jealous. I had to be sure. Anyhow, she's not in love with me. Since you couldn't be sure of her... you kept me around just in case? But that's not the point. Do you mean to say there was never any love between us two? I'm sorry. Never. What? "Perfume." Is it my turn? Is it my turn, Carmichael? It's your turn. Well, gentlemen, "perfume"... seven letters, double-letter count... plus twenty points for going out. You stole them, of course? No, you can't accuse me of that. They're all my squares. Then you cheated. Never cheated in my life. And must you rob me of my pleasure? I'm bored the moment I play a game to win. Seventy-eight points for me. -Mark them down, then. -I don't want to keep score. -Put it down. -all right. Your last word, what was it? "Garden," right? And mine was "perfume." Yours was "perfume," right. Double-word score, and I went out, too. Let's see, that's a triple. What do you do with a "Q" and no "U"? Hold it. Well, I'll have to pass. Sorry, Carmichael. You'll have to excuse me. Hello? No, the boss isn't here now. He'll be back at three o'clock. Have a look. You won't regret it. Why? What is it? Look down there. He's the one I told you about. Not bad at all. You'll see. Doesn't hear me. Have you got a match? -Sure. What for? -You'll find out. Watch this. Hello! Come on up. You know the way? By the staircase, there. You go on with what you were doing. Ah. How are you? Have you met Edward? Antoine. -Delighted. -How do you do? -Long time since I've seen you. -Yes. It was sixteen days ago. Exactly. The night of my birthday. You have work to do, don't you? Why, yes. Please feel free to look around. There are a lot of interesting things to see. Is painting a passion of yours? No. No, I prefer sculpture. Aha. Well, then, dear fellow... -I'm mad about sculpture. -I know what you mean. I adore volumes, forms, materials. What's this we hear about Diane? Broken up with her, have you? Yes. Your information's correct. And now she's all alone, like me. Like you. Like Lucille, weeping alone on the beach. -Weeping on the beach? -Mm-hmm. Like these figures there silently weeping. We can't see it. Their backs are to us. I don't have to explain what you already know. She's crazy about you. That's what brought it all on... her slowly turning into an alcoholic at St. Tropez. She's languishing alone on the beach. -She's alone? -Hmm? More or less alone. There's nobody with her. It's fascinating, isn't it? The confrontation of those two worlds? Why, yes, she must be all alone... because Charles just returned to Paris. Poor Lucille. My friend Carmichael saw her yesterday... stumbling along on the pier. tell me. You're not inventing that, Johnny? Not at all. You're a great guy, Johnny, but you're looking at a fool. So long, Johnny. Hey, you don't even know her address. -I'll find it. -Or her phone number. You can phone from here if you'd like. Tahiti Beach. You're wanted on the phone. Who is it? I don't know. I didn't get his name. Hello. Hello, Lucille? This is Antoine. -Antoine. -May I come see you? Why, yes. When? I'm at the airport. I'm leaving right away. Could you meet me in Nice? Yes. Yes. Antoine, come right away. Hurry. Come right away. Hurry. I read the last two books your company published. -Did you like them? -Yes. I was in charge of the one by Metivier. I thought that was the best one. I'm starving. Where shall we eat? We're going to the station. We'll take the night train... and tomorrow morning, you'll tell Charles. all right. Come inside. No. I've said all I had to say. Antoine's waiting in the street. Come inside. Now listen... you've got to believe me when I say that I love you. You've got to understand that whatever happens to us... I'll never be able to get over you. I'll never forget you, never replace you. Antoine's in love with you for himseIf... where I'm in love with you for you alone. And where Antoine wants to be happy with you... I'd go without you if you'd be happier. Look at me! He's going to be resentful of what you are-- easygoing, gay... almost cowardly. all the things that I love most about you, he'll hate in you. But if he ever harms you... or if he doesn't give you back to me... in a month or three years unchanged, then he'll pay. But remember one thing. If there's anything you need... you'll have it, no matter what it is. Do you have to leave now? Yes. Take with you whatever's yours. No. Why not? Would he object? No, I would. Ah. Well, this way... I can at least look at your dresses in the closets... your car in the garage. You could be gone for longer than you think. Who knows? Charles... No. Charles... No. Don't you think you've taken much too long? I want to say good-bye to Pauline. I made some marmalade for you-- the kind you like most. Take a jar with you. Don't you worry about it, child. It'll work out. How difficuIt men are, aren't they? You'll be back. No. Oh, I could lie in bed all day Lie in bed all day Got to do it gently. While sun pours through the window-- Sun pours through the win-- My glass ran over. I've never been so happy. -Look what you're doing. -Here's to holidays. I propose a toast to our vacation. Lovely. It's so cold. Is that all? Oh, it's so good. Don't bite. The end of the vacation, Antoine... the end of a perfect summer. We'll have to go back to work again. You won't be beside me the whole day long. Our vacation-- nobody I know would believe it. We were so happy and so... You were so jealous of every man. I was petrified that you might leave me. How happy we were together. -You awake already? -Mm-hmm. Mm. What nerve. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. What time is it? It's almost 8:00. -Did you sleep well? -Yes. It was pouring when I got up. Oh, this weather. And if the bus does come... there won't be any more room. I don't see what you're running from. It's only rain. Only five passengers. Seventy-one. -Did you see that? -Seventy-two. I've been standing here for an hour. Sorry. I'm sorry. Did you see how she shoved me? The nerve of some people. -You take it. -Thank you. It's a long way to the Louvre without a car. You don't ever go out. You should. You should get some fresh air. Oh, sure, air. Have you seen my hair? That's a man every time-- "Get some fresh air." It's a lot better than being shut up in here, isn't it? It's when I'm outdoors that I'm shut up the most. Oh, no! You wait hours for a bus that never comes... with all those people shoving. Here, I feel human. There's space. There's no rush. Oh, I'll have to go to the hairdresser. Not till the first of the month. Antoine, are you annoyed? Not at all. I know it's silly, but I'm worried. If you don't do anything all day... you'll end up bored with yourseIf... sick of yourseIf and me and of us. I know what you think, but you don't understand... that I'm never bored with myseIf... and I'm quite happy with you. You don't need anyone, least of all me. And what's more, I'm not completely sure of you. Who knows? You might start seeing someone here... every afternoon like we used to. You mean you suspect me of having a lover? I can't be sure. It's possible. No, all I wanted to say... is that you ought to find a job you like. Do something where you get out. Keep in touch with life. Oh, life. I've had enough of it. Yeah? I'd like to know when. Look, I was just going to suggest something. It's perfect for you. I'm sure it wouldn't take any time to arrange. Lucille, do you hear me? Lucille? Yes, my dear, I hear you. There's no one l'd rather hear. This is important, really. You could've fooled me, the act you put on. This will change your life completely. I'm dying to hear what it is. -Are you sure? -Sure. Pay attention, then. I'll explain it to you. -It's very simple. -Stay where you are. I'm afraid I'm just not interested. Now listen. Two black coffees and a lemonade. He's stupid, that jockey. I wouldn't worry about it, not with Carolus tomorrow. -Carolus? -Yeah, and at ten to one. If you don't tell Antoine, I'll give you ten francs. Strictly between you and me. -Here. -Right. Devils. You're not to have anything to do with that crap. But I don't. Be a good girl. -You could say hello. -Hello. Did you give any thought to last night's discussion? Why, yes. Really. Your idea is very appealIng. You may have quite a time finding me a good job... even with your contacts. But I'm warning you. If I'm hired, the fat's in the fire... because I know what it takes to succeed. To be successful, you need courage and ambition... a sense of direction, and a bit of good humor. Mm-hmm. Would a whiskey be all right? A whiskey at the end of the month? Sort of a celebration. That position we discussed, it's all set. -What did you say? -You got it. I spoke to the boss. There's a job for you... in the archives, starting Monday at 9:00. -You're fooling, aren't you? -Absolutely not. You're not fooling me, then. -Aren't you glad? -Yeah, sure. Delighted. It's just lovely. But it's not a permanent thing. No, but with ambition... good humor, plenty of perseverance-- -Sure, sure. -The fat's in the fire. The things you make one go through. -Aren't you glad? -Yes. It's terrific. Maybe now you'll allow me to-- -Sure. -Good. Here you are, Etienne, for Carolus. Oh, I see. I'm beginning to understand. It's a question of one side... spying on the other side's spies. Counterespionage, is that the idea? Here you are, the file on the Red Guard spot. Lucille, when you finish, bring me file number 72-90. Lucille! -What was that number? -72-9-0. I asked you for the file on Igor Stravinsky. There you are. You got to get upstairs right away. That file on Israel is in a complete mess. What? It took me three days to prepare. I'm sorry. It wasn't enough. Who is it for? This is ridiculous. Put this one where it belongs now. Surely you don't expect it till tomorrow. By the way, I almost forgot to tell you the bad news. We're working until midnight. That's just delightful. Antoine? Antoine, I'm sorry, but I've got to stay late at work. I hate to leave you alone. It's mean of them not to have told us before now. I couldn't give you a fair warning. -My pictures. -Right away. -When? -Tomorrow. Supposing you went down? Maybe Etienne would make you a sandwich. Uh-huh. We don't see each other. It's so sad. I don't have any more time for you. No. It's sweet of you, but if you're tired, don't wait for me. Antoine, I love you. Hey, you know, they're delighted with your work here. -Really? -I heard them say so. You ought to accept Laurent's luncheon invitation. He's rather nice and not stupid. And he loves women. I have no intention of having lunch with him. You'd better watch it. Your navel's showing. Boy, she's all right, this Lucille. They should commit that one. Well, I think I'll get a bite. Shall I come with you? Would you rather be alone? -Sure you don't mind? -Oh, no, I'll be OK. I'll go find Sirer. He's nice to go out with. He makes conversation. He's not bad. Sounds enchanting. Don't be catty, dear. He's my lover. Oh, pardon me. Lucien. Same thing, please. What's this? Aren't you eating today? -No, I don't feel like it. -It's the weather, huh? -What's wrong with the weather? -It's lousy. Young lady, do you think Lucille might be good enough... to present herself in my office? Lucille? Lucille? What are you doing back here? I've called you ten times. You're wanted upstairs. -Huh? -I said you're wanted upstairs. Oh, I'm not going. Why not? Because of this. Here, look at this. Oh. -Don't be foolish. -You're the ones who are fools. Look, angel, if Antoine would phone me later... will you say that I've just gone out on business? Where are you going? -On vacation. -But where? To Paris. Oh, boy, I've had it. Hey, watch it, watch it. Listen, Etienne. I discovered the truth with a capital "T." -No fooling? -Listen to me. -Hold it. -I'm in no hurry. all right, let's hear it. "Respectability, that's what did it. "I found out a long time ago that it's idleness... "which breeds all our virtues that are most bearable-- "contemplation, equitableness... "laziness, letting other people alone. "Plus good digestion, mental and physical-- "the intelligence to concentrate our attention... "on the pleasures of the flesh-- "eating and evacuating... "and fornicating and sitting in the sun"... "than which nothing is better... "nothing to match... "nothing else in all this world... "but to live for the short time... "which you are alone on this earth... "to breathe, to be alive, and to know it." William Faulkner, my friends. There you are. I've made my decision. I'd leave you to make of it what you will. Good-bye. Good-bye. I'll meditate on what you said. How was your day, Lucille? Let's hear. Magnificent. There were a lot of problems that came along... which are well on their way to be solved. I'm going to start by compiling background stories... then feature writing, and pretty soon doing articles. Great. The boss offered to give me a raise. And what's more, I feel that I'm headed for... a most unique position-- the most unique ever. Have you been celebrating again? -Of course I have. -You see? I was right. And I'm proud of you. I don't want you to be proud of me. I want you to love me. That's all. You understand? I want you to love me. Just love, that's all. See you later, darling. Next stop, please. -Good afternoon, madame. -Good afternoon. Won't you sit down? I want to sell this necklace. Really? It's one of yours. I would like you to make a copy of it, too. Mm-hmm. That's easily done. Oh, yes. Yes, I think I recognize it. If my memory serves me, it was a special order... for Mister... Mr. Charles Blassans-Lignieres. I don't have much time... but I don't need much money for it, either. Very well, madame. We'll certainly do our best. If you'll excuse me a moment... I think it can be done. -Of course. -Just a minute. You'll notice the workmanship is excellent. Well, it's the sapphire there. I don't know if I like the sapphire... -with the-- -turquoise-- ...with the turquoise on the side there. We can change it for you. Excuse me just a second. Would you mind if I offered you that? Or that? Really. I'm serious, miss. I think you've got the wrong... No? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. Then I wonder if you might at least... like to have lunch with me somewhere. You know, there must be some mistake. -I don't understand. -You see... I don't know anyone in Paris, and I'm lonely-- lonely and bored. -Are you American? -Yes. What are you looking at? At that column. And if you really want to know, I've climbed to the top... with the only man I'll ever love. There will never be another man for me. Light? How does one go up to the top? You call the porter of your hotel... but I'm warning you, the stairs can be murderous. Ah, of course. I guess I'll go to my solitary lunch without you. Yes, you will. Before I go, may I ask you what's your first name? Lucille. And yours? -Peter. -Peter. Good-bye. It's been a pleasure, Peter. Thank you, Lucille. They gave me a raise. -And we're celebrating? -Yes. Well... -Run, run, run, run, run! -Go! Come on! -Faster! -Run! Go on, faster! Run for it! That's it! Go! Go on, run! Damn it! Aw. It's a fix. all right. That's enough. I get the picture. She's not here. How long has it been since she left? Excuse me. I've got a phone call to make. You've been at it for half an hour. -You can forget it. -But I'm not finished. She could be at the bar, or I don't know where. -Just tell me. -all right. She quit. -What do you mean, quit? -She walked out three weeks ago. -You're crazy. -Please let me go! They haven't seen you for three weeks. You haven't been paid a cent. Another tie. Where do you get the money? And those records? And everything else, huh? And where did you have lunch? You're screaming. Do you suspect me of streetwalking? Don't be ridiculous. I don't know what you did. I only know you've been lying to me for three weeks. That I know. Is it Charles? -Charles? -Yes, Charles. Your sweaters, these ties of yours... your records, your life. No, not from Charles. It's Faulkner. As for the money, I sold my diamond necklace for it. You're wearing it right now. But this is a phony-- just a copy. You'll see. It'll shatter. It didn't break. It's still phony. I couldn't bear that job. -After one month? -Yes, after one month. I traded the diamond necklace with the jeweler... for a false one. But what have you been doing all day long? -Nothing. -Nothing at all? Nothing at all. I played records. I read a lot. I took long walks and dreamed of being with you. I was happy. No, Lucille. You don't think I believe that. You must believe it, Antoine... because there's nothing more to say. I even told you I'm not made for work. It was making me sick. It was making me ugly. I was miserable. Can you really blame me for that? all right, but why didn't you try to explain it? But you were happy. I was happy when you were. Look, I live with you, I sleep with you, talk to you... and I don't know what's going on. -You're driving me crazy. -Yes, but since I love you-- You love me. Loved by who, by what? Am I loved by a woman, a flower? You're there. You may as well be anywhere else. I want to be right here. What in God's name do you want to do in life? To love you, love you, love you, love you, love you! Damn it. Oh, God. I think you can see the apartment from here. Yes. There. You see the red curtains? It's right below that on the seventh floor. No. I'm sure it's in that building over there... on the seventh floor... between the two little windows. and the big one. That's where your two rooms are. You heard the traffic noise when we saw it. It never stops. It's terrible. I don't understand how people can do it... with two or three children. And no more money than we have, either. Don't ask me to. I'm very sorry, but we'd better take it. With the baby we'll need more than one room. Lucille, l'd like to know one thing. Do you want to have that baby or not, huh? Do you want him or not? Maybe later on, but not now. Can't you just see a child of yours, of mine? He'll follow us around. He'll look at his mother. We'll laugh together. Don't think I haven't dreamed of it. But we can't have a baby growing up here. I just couldn't. It's impossible. Look at it. It's too big. Hello, Miss Lucille. Hello, Jean. How have you been? Just fine. Is your wife any better? Oh, her asthma, you know. We used to use these when I was young. Only they tarnish so easily. There's a terrific new polish out. You simply put it in to soak, and it's finished. You've lost some weight, haven't you? No, I wouldn't say that. Are you still having difficuIty with the gardener? I bet you haven't heard the latest. I told him to repaint the garden furniture in white. You're already here. I hope I haven't kept you waiting. So pretty. I'll always remember the fragrance. Would you like a whiskey? Oh, no, thank you. What's wrong with your voice? I've been working too hard and talking too much. Now, what are those worries... that you refuse to speak about on the phone? Charles, I'm going to have a child... but I don't want a baby. I'm not ready now. I need money. I saw one of those doctors here, but I got frightened. I've never understood why... you always seemed to enjoy sitting there. Perhaps you really should have a child. Perhaps not. You sure you don't want to keep it? -No, I don't. -Life is all backwards. I just wish I could be the father of your child. I would've provided you with two nurses if you'd wanted them. But you wouldn't even want to have a child of mine, would you? No. You don't want anything of your own-- no house, no husband, no children. Nothing. It's very strange. I've often wondered if you have any parents. Oh, by the way, thank you for helping my mother. I know you kept on sending her money. I'm fond of your mother. I forbid you to let him pay for that, do you hear me? I forbid you to let him pay for that. Antoine... all right, so I'm in no position to moralize... but there's a limit. You borrowed the money you need from your old lover... for murdering the child of the one you live with. No! I suppose it's more moral for me to get cut up... by the butcher you're able to afford. He'd let me die on the street... and that's exactly what would happen. Please keep your voice down, damn it. You have a strange sense of pride, Antoine. Well, Lucille, can't we please keep it? We'll make out all right. I'm sure they'll give me another raise. We could put it in a nursery during the day. It'd be arranged. It's not as if the world's come to an end. Maybe not for you, but it's the end of my world. I mean that. You can be quite a coward. What an egotist. When you're 60 years old with no one around you... you won't get by on your charm anymore. No one will care if you live or die. I'll have myself to thank for it. ls that it? That's about it. You don't think you're being cowardly, hypocritical? It doesn't matter what I have to go through. all that bothers you is that Charles is paying. I want you to give me that check. No. Then you'll tear it up. No. It's not in there. I don't want to. Please. I'm not able to. Listen to me--take your time to think it over carefully. But I told you I don't want it. Lucille... I'm not able to. It's wrong for us... for me, for you, for the child. It wouldn't be right. I'm simply not able to. If only we lived by the sea. You could have been a fisherman. And I would cook the fish you caught. We would live like-- It isn't us you mean. You mean yourself, Lucille. When I talk about me... I'm talking about the woman you love, just as she is! I'm going to get the tickets this morning for Geneva. Are you afraid? Just very tired. Very tired. Very... We've been talking about it and nothing else. I wish you understood me. I don't feel very well. You need more rest. I don't want you walking for miles... in the Luxembourg Gardens. Don't worry about it. will you promise me? all right. I promise. See you tonight. Excuse me. Johnny! What are you doing here? Just admiring a romantic encounter... without daring to interrupt it. You realize you're sitting at the table of Lenin. tell me, how are you? How's everyone in our little group? They're fine. I'm fine. We all are. And you--are you happy? Very happy. You sure? They say happiness rarely ever shows. You're the same as ever. You used to dress more fashionably. I had more means then. It's a pity. I would have thought you might ask about Charles. You know that he's been ill. What's wrong with him? He's thinner, much thinner. Not as strong as he used to be. He doesn't seem to enjoy anything. Even if you don't feel like it... you really ought to telephone him. It may be more than just discouragement. These days, one can usually expect the worst. It's not that bad. I was in bed with bronchitis for a week at Christmas. But I got over it. You swear that's all it was. Good Lord, of course I swear. What do you want me to do anyway? Johnny made it sound as though... you were suffering from cancer, to be exact. Cancer? That's why you called me on the telephone? You didn't want me to die all alone. I don't want you to die at all. Your hair's just as blond... your eyes have the same twinkle... and you're more beautiful than ever. Do you think so? Didn't anyone tell you? Yes, but I never get tired of hearing it. Of all people...Claire. She's not as pretty. I have been wondering if you're free Thursday. There's a formal reception at the La Moll's. One of their concerts. They're doing a sonata of Mozart... the one you like so much. You remember? You know, the sonata where he always repeats... that same phrase, that same little phrase... the same 4 notes which obsessed him throughout his life. But then it might be rather awkward. Why would it? I don't know if Antoine likes music. Maybe an invitation from me... would annoy him. I think it would. Give me that before you break your wrist. That's it. Elegant. Do you think that would take long? Six minutes. I nearly phoned you... at the publisher's this afternoon... to ask if we could meet for an hour. I had in mind a small hotel, the Crystal Hotel. My mother always used to stay there when she was in Paris. What does your mother have to do with it? Nothing. It's just that the hotel is next to your office... and my mother always stayed there. I almost rented a room. I meant to, but I didn't. What stopped you? I guess it's because your work is important. It'd be wrong to distract you. Lovely, isn't it? If you distract anyone, l'd prefer it to be me. But I didn't mean anyone else. I didn't want to distract you, I said. It's one of those words... that describes exactly what I mean. Antoine...are you not happy? As happy as you could be? Yes. And you? Yes. Very happy. But I would not enjoy watching it without you. You'll love it. This horror movie is good. It's terrific. One of the best. Is it long since you saw it? No, but it's a while back. I'd love to see it again. Please stay then and forget your dinner. But, sweetheart, it's an editor's dinner. You know I'm stuck. We're presenting my new edition. It's very important. See you later. It won't be too spooky for me? No, I'm sure it won't. See you later. -Antoine! -What? Wait a little. Come here. Turn around. That coat you're wearing looks terrible. For the price... Look, Lucille, I have to walk a mile to get to the dinner. -Don't get upset. -Good-bye. See you. Hello? Lucille. Hello? How are you? No, of course not. But tonight I'm going to that concert at La Moll's. Yes, the one I mentioned. But I'm not. No, no. I've decided to go alone. What do you mean, nothing to wear? Wait, just a second. Hello? You've got Well, I'll go change. Antoine, it's me. You woke me up. What time is it? A bit past midnight. How come you're still out at this hour? I'm with friends. I won't stay long. Well, did you like it? Yes, it was beautiful. Good. Come home soon. I'll leave the key in the door. Try not to wake me. I have to get up early tomorrow. Good night, sweetheart. Stay here. Julie, switch the phone on. Antoine? I spent the night with Charles. Antoine, it's finished. No, you were not happy with me anymore. Neither was I. But it was not your fault, not mine either. I'm gone. No, it's finished.
