It's just my funny ankle. Your what? I fell off a horse when I was little. Then you didn't tell me everything. Every time I get nervous, I slip the shoe off my heel. Miss Blake, you will remain after class And copy your marriage vows 500 times. Charmed. Miss Blake doesn't live here anymore. There's only a mysterious Mrs. Myles. happy honeymoon, Professor Myles. Best wishes, sir. Good luck, sir. Sorry, sir. They just made their getaway. Where are they headed for? Well, do you know the number of the car? All right. Scotland yard extension. Hello? Let me speak to inspector Beale. This is the foreign office. Peter Galt speaking. Hello, inspector. Pick up a car carrying Richard Myles and his bride, Heading for a continental honeymoon. Should be somewhere between here and Dover. Don't let them leave the country before I see them. It's urgent. Thanks. But this isn't the lord Walden. It isn't Dover, either. What are you afraid of, Richard? The Oxford sense of humor, dear. It's deadly this time of the year. They'll be waiting at the lord Walden. Think of all the fun and games You'll deprive them of. Yes. Think of it. Well... Good evening. Good evening. Careful, dear. Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Ahem. I suppose it's all right. First door on the left, Top of the stairs. Mind you, draw the blinds. What? There's a practice blackout tonight. Oh. You mind? Uh-uh. "We always have to pay for all we have "and what we hope to have. "I hate to think of what the peace "and serenity of our honeymoon, Grabbed from a crazy world, will cost us. " What are you looking for? April 2nd. Oh, you remember that day? "April 2nd. "I met Richard Myles. "He doesn't seem to have progressed "beyond the paleolithic age... 15,000 years B.C." "I decided to marry him. " Oh, but I... I haven't finished the day's doings. You can't finish it. Why not? Because it isn't over yet. Who is it? Mr. Smith? Smith? You've got the wrong room. Oh, Smith! Yes, this is Smith. What is it? It's constable Jones from the village. Can I have a word with you, sir? Right now? If you please. All right. Mr. Edward Smith? Uh, yes. Could I trouble you to step downstairs with me, sir? This is no time for practical jokes. This is no joke, missis. It isn't very practical, either. That just may be, But I must trouble you to come down, sir... And come quietly. Very well. You won't be gone long, will you, Mr. Smith? Five years. That's the maximum for false registration. You know, I can explain all this. I'm glad you can. You've given us a lot of trouble. The whole police force has been looking for you. Really? Well, you know what college undergraduates are. A bridegroom sort of has to protect himself in the clinches. We'd have had you before if you hadn't changed cars. That's what did it. Did what? I have to hold you, sir, until a certain party From the foreign office gets here. The foreign office? Wait in here, if you please. He's on his way now. In Paris, you'll make your first contact, Then go right into Germany... Have a heart, Peter. I shouldn't even be talking to you. My bride's upstairs wondering what's happened to me. We both know what it means If the Germans go into Poland, And our information is they will. Yes, I know, but... It won't be easy to find this man. People in Germany don't talk these days. Even our own people will only give you indications, Never a word that might incriminate them. So you see, I need a fellow Who's sort of bright and reads signs. Thanks very much, but this is my wedding night... The man you're looking for Has completely disappeared. I don't know what his name is... I don't even know what he looks like... But if the gestapo have got him, We may have to reorganize our whole setup. Well, we all have our little troubles, Peter. Good night. I'm asking you to do something of vital importance. It's only fair to tell you That there's an element of risk attached to it To both yourself and your wife. The man you're looking for Has complete details of the new German secret weapon. Secret weapon? I thought that was just Nazi ballyhoo. It really exists. Ever heard of a magnetic mine? No. What is it? Underwater mine That attracts itself to ships by magnetism. It's an ingenious idea. It's more than that. Imagine what that could do to our lifelines. Remember the last war? Yes. How does it work? I wish we knew. Find that man, And he'll give you the electrical formula. Oh. Then your scientists will figure out a way to counteract it. It's our only chance. I believe you can make the grade If you two are willing to take the risk. Well, if I know Frances, she'll want to help. Anyone would in a case like this. Thanks. Don't let her know how serious it is. Women are inclined to overplay their hand. Just tell her you're doing me a little favor By hunting up someone we've lost sight of. Oh, hello, dear. Come on in. Frances, this is Peter Galt. Congratulations. I'm sorry I couldn't get to the wedding. I've told you about Peter. We were undergraduates together. Yes, I know. Richard's very fond of you, In spite of what appears to be A rather morbid sense of humor. She's lovely, Richard. I'm sorry to intrude, And I didn't mean to keep Richard so long. I was telling him my adventures In trying to find you tonight. I wouldn't have missed hearing about them For the world, but if you'll excuse us... Well, certainly, certainly. Oh. I suppose by now your confederates Have moved our bed out of our room? No, darling. You have the wrong idea. You mean this isn't just an undergraduate prank? Oh, no, I assure you. Peter had something he wanted to tell us. I know it's a bit thick to intrude on your... I mean, to intrude. I had to catch Richard Before he left the country. But we'll be back in two or three weeks. It's really nothing, dear. It's just a little errand that Peter wants us to run While we're on the continent. That's all, Just a little errand. You're from the foreign office, aren't you? More or less. And you had the whole police force Looking for us? Not the whole force. You want us to run an errand for you on the continent? Oh, Richard, we're spies! I say, you're nothing of the sort. I told you... we're just running an errand, that's all. Well, then, why all the hurry? I knew you were going To South Germany on your honeymoon. There's a friend of mine there Who hasn't written lately. I'm worried about him. I want Richard to look him up As soon as it's convenient. That's all there is to it. Well, why don't you telegraph him? I don't know who he is. Oh, I see. Riddles. It's very simple, dear. There's a man in Paris who's going to tell us Where to find Peter's friend. Well, that's fine. Who's the man in Paris? We don't know. Oh, you don't know. No, of course not. It would be much too easy to find a man we knew. It'll be easy to find this man, too. All we have to do is go to the cafe de I'opera On Saturday night at 10:00 And spill a glass of cointreau. I know... Don't tell me. We climb through a train window, Fire off a gun in a deserted theater, Whistle Annie Laurie backwards, And Boris Karloff will fall out of a closet With an apple in his mouth. Be gentle with my wife. She's an American. So are you, Benedict Arnold. Her conception of foreign affairs Stems directly from Hollywood. Please, Mrs. Myles, don't dramatize this little errand. I'm asking Richard to do this Because he's... well, he's an ordinary chap And an American. He's been climbing in the Tyrol For the past eight years regularly. I'm sure he won't attract undue attention Or be interfered with. Oh, I see. Typical tourists, above suspicion. Right. Any last-minute instructions? Richard's got them. Mmm, I see. Actually, dear, the less you know Or seem to know, the better. That's what my mother told me The night I came out in Boston. You'll wear a hat with a red rose on it. Must I? For purposes of identification. Oh. While the waiter's mopping up the cointreau, Use the phrase "Mrs. rose says," Then name a meeting place. Mr. X of Paris will contrive to indicate a time. Follow that up, and he'll give you the instructions Where and how to find the next man. The next man? Wait a minute. How many men are there? I'm not sure, but my friend Will be at the end of the trail. For the rest, just follow your noses And use your common sense. Above all, don't get mixed up In anything suspicious. Oh, no. And don't get excited. No, no. Of course not. Good night. Good night. Good night, Peter. Well, you see, dear? It's really nothing. Spies... I'm actually trembling. Are you cold, dear? I must get a hat with a big red rose... What are you doing? I thought you said you were shivering. No, darling, not shivering. Trembling. Oh. Aren't you even the least little bit nervous? Well, yes, But, uh, no more than is customary On a honeymoon, I guess. Just think of what's ahead of us. 'tis the last rose of summer the last rose... A rose by any other name... They shouldn't have any trouble seeing that, should they? You know, that's not bad. That's not bad at all. That's very pretty. Thank you, darling. Richard, somebody's been Messing about with my things. When we went to dinner, My glove case was there, And the bottles of perfume Were in the center like that. The maid probably dusted. No, she dusted this morning. I was afraid of this. No matter what she dusted, darling, We are now going to the cafe de I'opera. Stop imagining things. Oh. Oh. Pardon, monsieur, madame. Usually monsieur, madame have gone out by this time. That's perfectly all right. Will madame need anything more this evening? No, nothing more tonight, thank you. Merci, madame. Come on, darling. Salaam aleicham, lady and gentleman. Salaam aleicham. Very old rug. Many hundred years old. Not today, thank you. I will give him for 100 francs. I said not today. This carpet, it belongs to the emir of Baghdad. His wives make it for him. He keeps them very busy. It tells the story of his life. Very dirty. What on earth did you say to him? Very dirty, like carpet. Allah have mercy. It just isn't true. What? It's aunt Hattie and aunt Ellen from Boston. It's almost 10:00. I know. Here they come. What do we do? Drug them heavily and ship them to Rio. Frances, my dear. Of all people, of all people. Yes, isn't it? Your Uncle Fred will be so delighted When he hears about this, But we thought you were in Oxford, studying. Oh, yes, I was. All theory and no practice Makes Fran a dull girl. N'est-ce pas, Cherie? Oh, Richard! Don't be nervous. Aunt Hattie understands, Or you wouldn't be in Paris, would you? I'm aunt Ellen. I'm so sorry. I don't think you've met... The name is Smith. Mr. Edward Smith. How do you do? How do you do? Where are you staying, Frances? Oh, we're in... A little hideout over on the left bank. When you write Uncle Frederick, I wouldn't mention that you've seen us. It's all right with me, but Fran here, well... You know how it is. Quite. Thanks. It's lucky you're the sporty type. Must run in the family, eh, Fran? It's been nice seeing you, Frances. We're at the Crillon if you need us. Yes, Frances, if you're in any trouble... Don't you worry about Fran. She's in safe hands. Well, good-bye. Good-bye, Mr... Smith. Oh, Richard, how could you? Well, darling, it's 10:00. I couldn't take time to tell them How you swept me off my feet And made an honest man of me Before your family knew it, Almost before I knew it. Well, we got work to do. Here goes. Shall I start the "Mrs. rose" signal? Mm-hmm. They say Mrs. rose... That is to say, Mrs. rose says that... Je Ne parle pas anglais. Oh. Je suis desole, madame. Mrs. rose says the frisky rabbit cafe In Montmartre is really wonderful. N'est-ce pas? Oui, madame. Certainement, madame. Spill yours. Mrs. rose says the frisky rabbit cafe In Montmartre is really very original. Pardon. Oui. Le frisky rabbit at 11:00. Bonsoir, monsieur. Madame, monsieur? Table for two, please. This way, please. All mans are brothers. Brothers in freedom, love, Music, song, and the arts. Madame? Monsieur? Oh, we didn't order these. Compliment of the house, monsieur. Oh. Thank you. You're welcome, madame. Uh, well... No, no, no. Pas encore, monsieur. No? Oh, I see. You have never visited us before. No, I haven't. You see, every new arrival must perform Before they have their drinks. It's the house custom. Sing for your supper, huh? C'est exactement, monsieur. You see, we don't do... But, madame... Have you seen him anywhere? It isn't quite level. Watch your walk. Oh, right. What will we do? Sing, I guess. Ladies and gentlemen, my wife and I will oblige With a famous old American folk song. she's only a bird in a gilded cage a beautiful sight to see you may think she is happy and free from care she's not, though she seems to be seems to be 'tis sad when you think of her wasted life for youth cannot mate with age He's at the bar. for her beauty was sold for an old man's gold she's a bird in a gilded cage Do you see him? No. Do you think he left? Must have. Come on. Oh, it's way past our bedtime. Bonne nuit, monsieur. Monsieur! Your coat! Oh. Merci mille fois. Bonsoir, monsieur. Bonsoir, madame. What's that? A guide to Southern Germany. Where did you get it? I didn't. It got me. There's no indication there. It's just an ordinary guidebook. It's a guide to Southern Germany, So that must be where they're telling us to go. Yeah, but Southern Germany's a big place. There's a map here in the back. Let's have a look at it. It might tell us something. Hey, look. What are all those little dots? They look like ink marks. Richard, it's a clue! It must be. It could be. Give me your pencil. What are we supposed to make out of little dots? I don't know, but let's follow them. Maybe we'll find something Or they'll spell out something. Hey, now you're going. Something's coming up. Looks like an "e", doesn't it? Yeah. No, it looks like an "s". Look. Richard, it's a clef. Music. Music? Yeah, see? It's simple, isn't it? Yes, dear. Mrs. Myles, you're remarkable. da da dum... my love is like a red, red rose Darling, I told you You should go to the movies more often. Yeah, but wait a minute. My love is like a red, red rose... Where does that get us? It's obviously a password, And either we whistle it or hum it... Or they do. Yeah. Who are they? There you've got me. I don't know. Look... what are those? Three pinholes. What are you supposed to figure out from that? It could be three people Or the third day of the month or... The third page of this book. "A. Werner, Salzburg. " Bookstore. Current literature, rare books... First editions... Old music albums. Fran, how would you like to go to Salzburg? If they don't take it easy, They'll be burnt out before they're 21. Oh! That's what I hate. I'm so tired of looking over my shoulder. Let's take a look up here. All right. Oh! Not again. No, darling, not this time. It's the cobblestones. They're difficult to walk on. Oh, wait a minute, will you? A rose by any other name... No, not so good today. Not smart. What's the matter? No sleep last night? I slept all right, but I kept dreaming... Easy, kids. Here we go again. Oh... Oh, I'm so sorry. Honored, gracious lady. Honored. The polite type... unheard of in these parts. This might be a quaint little shop to explore. What's quaint about... Why, yes, it is kind of quaint. You know, they just might have it. We can ask. Of course, the 1836 edition is very rare. The shop looks as though it's been here since 1836. Guten tag. Sprechen sie englisch? Yeah. I'm looking for an edition of Schiller's plays, Published by Teubner of Leipzig in 1836. I've heard of no such edition. Well, that's all right. I have. If there was this book, I would know. Have you a catalog? Maybe that would know, too. Catalog? I am she here. She looks like one, too. I have a clipping here that will show you That there is such an edition. Yeah, but we do not have the book. Maybe there is someone here Who can tell us where we might find it. You will not find this book in Salzburg. Oh, I see you sell music, too. You don't mind my having a look around, do you? Thank you so much. We used to have this book at home. I remember... Good afternoon. Good afternoon. May I be of service? Mr. Werner? Yes. I'm looking for the Teubner 1836 edition of Schiller's plays. Oh, that's a very early edition. It is very rare. Uh, but, madame, you are soiling your fine gloves On these dirty books. That's quite all right. Ottilie, get a duster from the back room. The duster is here. Then it is a pity you do not use it more, And the duster is as dirty as the books. Get a clean one from the back room. Go, Schnell, Schnell! Oh, I'm sorry. What an attractive edition this is. Look, Richard, at the printing. Oh, there's not much demand for such books. They do not sing the old songs these days. Some of us do. Well... Uh, I'm afraid we do not have That book you asked for, But over here we have some later editions. Uh, would you dust my gloves, please? It would have been better You had taken off your gloves. Do you know the poet Heine? A man of simple habits. He loved so much his music and his roses. A friend of mine, whose tastes are rather similar, Tells me... He tells me that there is nothing he loves so much As reading Heine in his rose garden... In the late afternoon. I have another book of Schiller's That may interest you. I'll be back in a minute. Excuse me. Anything wrong? Heil Hitler! Wo ist er? It may sound silly to you, But we came in here to find a book. A book? Yes, to read. You know. Where is it? You've got me there, dope. Was heisst das "dope"? It's the 1836 edition of Schiller's plays. Perhaps you can suggest... No. Oh. Heil Hitler. Good day. I gave you our German greeting, American. We gave you ours, dope. Was heisst das "dope"? What's he saying? He's explaining that the object Of that little contraption is to reduce pain. Well, it doesn't exactly look like a sedative. It was last used in 1806. In 1827, And it's still in good working condition. Do not listen to that guide. He is not of the first grade. It's a coincidence, bumping into you again. Not a coincidence at all. I've been following you. Oh, really? It's very flattering. Not so flattering. I'm a... Guide. Oh. We don't need a guide, thank you. I'm sure I can interest you. This elaborate piece was a fascinating device for removing fingernails. It is still in good working condition. A totalitarian manicure. You don't look very much like a guide. Perhaps you don't look so much like tourists. My name is count Hassert Seidel. My friends call me Hassie. How do you do? And here... here we have the iron maiden... Otherwise known as the German statue of liberty. I'm surprised to hear a German say that. I'm an Austrian. Isn't that very much the same thing nowadays? Is that the English view? We're not English. We're Americans. Isn't that very much the same thing nowadays? May I suggest you change your lodgings to Frau Kleist's, Who runs a small hotel at 29 Langenstrasse. Charming place. Of course, I get a commission for recommending it. What a becoming hat you wear. I love red roses. Au revoir. Darling? We go this way, don't we? Yes. Come on. Good evening, Frau Myles. Good evening, Herr Myles. Good evening. Did you have a pleasant day? Yes, lovely, thanks. Charming couple. Most correct. Most. Have you observed her hat? Yes. Not exactly a thing of beauty, is it? Not only that. She has worn it the past four days without stopping. Even the Americans begin to feel the pinch. Thank you. Thank you. Come in. You haven't touched your food again. Why don't you go back to England? There's nothing more you could do here now. Oh, yes, there is. And the woman with the red rose in her hat Is still here. Have you talked to them yet? I wanted to make sure it wasn't a coincidence. It isn't. She wears it every day. I am getting a little bored, Waiting for somebody to appreciate this bonnet. A rose by any other name... Stinks. Hey, good shot. Where'd it go? On top of the stove. Bet you couldn't do that again in a million years. I'll bet I could. Bet you can't even get it. What do you want to bet? Well... Uh... Hey, that's my walking stick you're playing with. And that's my hat, too. Now, don't get excited, darling. I just got that stick in case... And you accuse me of getting my ideas from the movies. Oh, no, you don't. Give it here. It's sharp. Uh... Watch out. Yes? Come in. Come in? Oh, excuse me. No, no, that's quite all right, Frau Kleist. Come in... sit down. May I ask, do you go To the Liszt concert tonight? Yes, we do... I mean, yes, we are. I take, then, the liberty to ask... Do you know much about Franz Liszt, Herr Professor? Not a great deal. This book reproduces all his major works And supplies a most instructive commentary on his life. I thought it would help you more To enjoy the concert, And Herr Klopf is a most talented conductor. Oh, I'm sure it will be a great help. Thanks very much. Bitte. Frau Kleist? Frau Myles? There was a Liszt concert The second night we were here. Yes. Why didn't you lend us the commentary then? I wanted first to make sure We had the same taste in music. Oh? And what decided you? The little song the Professor sings so often. Is that one of your favorites? Yes, it's quite my favorite. Here. Thank you, Frau Kleist. Good-bye. You don't want to read about Liszt now, do you, honey? No, darling. Let's see. Concerto no. 1 in e-flat... That's what they're playing tonight. Page 212. Page 212. That's funny... page 212 is torn out. The lost chord. What are we supposed to figure out from a missing page? I don't know. What does the commentary say? Yes, I know, but what does it say? Oh. Ich allein verstehe means "no one understands but I." That is, no one understands but Liszt. Well, he's hardly in a position to help us. See appendix nine. Here it is. "Appendix nine. "Ich allein verstehe... "no one understands but I. "The publication of this lyric, "written in passionate protest "against the vicious treatment "accorded to his concerto no. 1, Marked the end"... Underlined... "of Liszt's prolonged feud with his critics. "It was about this time That a celebrated doctor"... underlined... "for years Liszt's most relentless critic, "gave up the unequal struggle And retired to his estate at Pertisau... " Underlined... Underlined... "near Innsbruck. "Here he devoted his remaining years "to writing his somewhat embittered memoirs And collecting chessmen... " Underlined. Underlined. Doctor... Pertisau... Chessmen. Then... Then, the end! Oh, Richard, then we could really have our honeymoon. Yes. Oh, that would be wonderful! Well, next stop, Pertisau. Oh, this bed feels pretty good. I think I'll take a nap before the concert. Well, why don't you? Here. Cover up. Sleep. "Gentle sleep that knitteth up The raveled sleave of care... " Oh, somebody's unraveling the sleeve. Sounds like the needle's stuck. Oh, it's awful. Herein. That's all right, sir. I'm English. You're Mr. Myles, aren't you? Yes, I am. My name is Thornley. How do you do? Won't you come in? Yes, thank you. I've seen you at Oxford. I'm there, too. Trinity. Is that so? Won't you sit down? No, thanks. I just dropped in to say that my wife has a headache And she wanted to get a little rest before the concert. I hope you don't think it rude of me... It is I that was rude. I thought you were out, otherwise... It's my place to apologize. Not at all. Let me get you a drink, sir. Thank you. I have a little kirsch. Kirsch, huh? Staying long, sir? No, we're leaving in the morning. We thought we'd climb Hafelekar. When you're in Oxford next time, I hope you'll come over and play your piece all the way through Without any rude interruption from me. Thank you. Thanks. Well, here's to Mrs. Myles... I'd say, the prettiest woman in Salzburg. Thank you. I agree. I'm sorry you're going to the concert tonight. I don't think you'll enjoy it. Why shouldn't we? This conductor Klopf is terrible. Oh, really? Frau Kleist seemed to think quite the contrary. What does Frau Kleist know? He's noisy. You know how the Germans love noise. Sig! Hey, this is a surprise. How are you, Richard? I'm glad to see you. I don't think you've met my wife. Darling, count Von Aschenhausen. How do you do? I read that you were married. My congratulations. Mother, may I present Mr. and Mrs. Myles? How do you do? How do you do? You stay long in Germany? Just a couple of weeks. Come along, mother. You don't want to miss the concerto, do you? I don't mind if I do. These jumpings of Herr Klopf Make me most nervous. Well, Richard, I hope your stay here will be a pleasant one. Madame? Good night. You know, darling, either there's a draft in here, Or I caught a faint hint of coolness in his manner. We used to be very friendly. Really? Yes. We were fellow Rhodes scholars at Oxford. Well, maybe it's just as well. We don't want to get mixed up with anybody We're not sure of at this stage of the game. Oh, who's playing cops and robbers now? Halt! My dear Richard, The police may be hunting for the murderer, But certainly, you and your wife are above suspicion. Let me see if I can arrange for you to leave. That's very kind of you. And, sig... We'd be very grateful if you could arrange something For Mr. Thornley here. He's also from Oxford. Mr. Thornley is well-known to you? Mr. Thornley is one of Richard's prize pupils. We're all staying at the Gasthof Kleist here. We're going out To do a little climbing in the Tyrol tomorrow. You are indeed fortunate, Mr. Thornley, To have such exemplary traveling companions. I'll see what I can do. I have a schloss... a castle... A few kilometer from here. It would be so nice If you would all take supper with me When we are out of this disagreeable place. We'd love to. Everything is arranged. Thank you, sig. Sigurd, your friends are going to sup with us. That would be very kind of them. Bitte. That was very decent of you, Mr. Myles. Don't mention it. And I mean, don't mention it. Something wrong with Mrs. Myles? It's just a little habit she has When she's nervous or upset. Frances? Thanks for getting us out of there, sig. Don't mention it, please, Richard. After all, it was nothing Compared to that night at Oxford When you rescued me from the clutches of that proctor. Ah, those were the good old days. I haven't forgotten them. When we first met you tonight, I thought you had forgotten. To tell you the truth, Richard, I was trying not to show my feelings. I must confess, I wasn't quite sure That you would want to recognize me. After all, I know how people in England feel about us. In your land, and in England, The country is the government, And the government is the country, But they do not understand That with other countries, That is not always so. For many of us here, life is not so easy, But this is our home, And we must live in it, And with great care. I do not live with care. Mother. I say whatever I please In a loud voice before a Nazi. Too bad he did not also shoot the conductor, But one cannot have everything. At least there is now one less bourgeois in the world. Colonel Gerold. A bank clerk. You're a dreadful snob, mother. The more snobs, the fewer colonel Gerolds. It was a very clever snob That shot colonel Gerold, mother. I wouldn't say so, sig. It's very easy to take a potshot at a sitting bird. Ah, but when did he take the potshot? That was the clever part. It was when the drummer came down, so. A second sooner or a second later, The shot would have been heard And our assassin seized. But he knew his Liszt, this man. Come. I will show you. I'm sorry you must go to the Tyrol tomorrow. Why do you wish to climb the Mountain? I don't know. It gets one away from things, I suppose. But from what do you wish To get away, Mr. Thornley? Nothing. I... Here it is. Now, who plays? You, Mr. Thornley? Well, yes, just a little. Will you please do us the honor? I'm afraid I'm not very familiar with this concerto. Oh, it doesn't matter. It's just the effect I want. I'm awfully sorry. I'm really no good at sightreading. Frances, why don't you take a shot at it? All right, I will have a shot at it. That's just what our assassin did. Already we see the hand of the assassin in his pocket. His fingers close round the gun. Now he takes his hand a little way from his pocket. With the approach of the crescendo, He takes the gun right out of his pocket. The drummer is raising his drumsticks... Our assassin is raising his gun... And now... Bang! You would have made a very good detective, Sigurd. Or a very good murderer. I think we should have something a little less morbid. Count Sigurd, you'll remember this. You went to Oxford. Oh, certainly. jolly boating weather and a hay harvest breeze Come on, Thornley. blade on the feather, shade of the trees Good night, Frau Kleist. Good night, Herr Thornley. Good night, Thornley. I'm so sorry, Frau Myles, You should have had this terrible experience. It just came over the radio. It wasn't very pleasant. It was a great tragedy. He was a most important man, this colonel Gerold. Is that so? Commandant of the concentration camp at dacha... A great pity, isn't it? Sad loss. May we have our bill first thing in the morning? We're leaving for Pertisau. To climb the mountains? Yes, And also look over a famous collection of chessmen. Thornley, I'm afraid I'm going to have To withdraw that invitation to climb. Well, of course. I never imagined you meant it seriously. But I did mean it. I suppose the sporting thing to do Would be to still take you along, But there are times when a man can't afford to be sporting. How long are you staying here? I'm thinking of going to Italy quite soon. I should make it very soon, if I were you. I'd do it again if I had the chance. He killed my fiancee because she wouldn't talk. She wouldn't tell them anything That would incriminate me. She was so brutally beaten That she died next morning in a cell at dacha... Dachau? We were asked to contact somebody over here... It all sounded very simple. Like you, we were above suspicion. But the same thing will happen to you and Mrs. Myles! They watch everything you do, Hear everything you say. I warn you. These are so beautiful, I think I'll have to learn to play chess. Are these for sale, Or did you make them for someone? A gentleman who lives here in the summer months Asked me to make them. Is he a collector? The Herr doctor Mespelbrunn? Doctor Mespelbrunn? Yes, indeed. He has a large collection, Including some very valuable Gruednetar pieces. Gruednetar? I wonder if we could see them? Why not? The Herr doctor is always pleased To show his collection to those Who really admire and understand. I see. We'll take a look. The Herr doctor's house is not far from here. Have you got a... Oh. The Herr doctor's house is a big one, On the Plaza. Pardon me. This is a little habit of mine... I acquired it from Dr. Mespelbrunn. He jokes to me about it, And he yet always does it himself. Really? Yes, always. He says without this little habit, He would not know himself. Thanks very much. I shall send your package to your hotel. Oh, thank you. Well, the end of the trail. My, but it's beautiful. Oh. Dr. Mespelbrunn, I presume. Right, Dr. Livingstone. Aren't you excited? Yeah, a little. My blood pressure's going up, too. I thought I was the only one That could do that to you. Don't be so conceited, darling. Do you think we'll be intruding? No. Collectors are always glad to see one another, Except when they both want the same thing. Guten tag. Ist Herr doktor Mespelbrunn zu hause? Kommen sie. Richard. Hmm? Remember when the O.U. Dramatic society Put on MacBeth... The two boys with the makeup? You mean "enter first and second murderer"? He looks like both of them. Yeah. The doctor certainly has a chess collection, Doesn't he? Mm-hmm. You know, Richard, There's an air of culture About this room. Could it be Oxford? Might be. I wonder. Germany's certainly a beautiful country, isn't it? Only one thing wrong with it. What's that? Too many Germans. Fran. Yes, darling? Well... This really is a pleasure. How did you discover my retreat? We didn't until this moment. No, we were looking for someone quite different. Really? Who? A Dr. Mespelbrunn. Oh, won't you sit down, please? Thank you. An old wood carver in Pertisau Told us that Dr. Mespelbrunn's chess collection Was well worth a visit. You know, chess is my weakness. No. I didn't know you played the game. Perhaps it was after you left Oxford That it took me up. This is Dr. Mespelbrunn's house, isn't it? Indeed it is, And I expect you're wondering what I'm doing here. I don't want to seem mysterious, But all I can tell you is that my presence here Is in connection with some very important work. And as two good democrats, I'm sure you will find yourself In complete sympathy with my work. But I'm being a terrible host. You must try some of our famous kirsch. You know, that was the most enjoyable singsong We had at mother's house. It was nice, wasn't it? Won't you sing for me again, Mrs. Myles? You mean now? Why not? Well, if you insist. Thanks, sig. Prosit. Mmm, that's delicious. Shall we play him our favorite, Richard? Why not? All right. Oh. Cigarette? Thank you. Will you sing it, darling? who is Sylvia? what is she that all our swains commend her? holy, fair, and wise is she that heaven such grace did lend her that adored she might be that adored she might be Bravo. Thank you. Memories of the old days at Oxford? You asked for it, you got it. Oh, that's my dog. He grows restless because he's shut in today For having been a bad boy. Will you excuse me? Hans. My man doesn't seem to be there. I'll let the dog out. I think he's been punished enough For one day. Will you excuse me for a minute? Oh, uh, I love dogs. May I see yours? I'm so sorry. I'm afraid he's rather difficult with strangers. What do you make of it? Mespelbrunn's in the soup, And if we'd given him the red, red rose signal, We'd be in it with him. Yes, but how did he know the signal? I don't know. The important thing is, he didn't know about the cigarette lighter. No, he didn't. What kind of a dog would you say that was? Could be an English bulldog, huh? Yeah. The ventilator. Who is it? Mespelbrunn. Get out of here. The gestapo are on their way down for you. Don't use the road. Wait until it's dark. I'll come back for you later. I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. Well, it worked. If we ever build a house, Believe me, it's going to have plenty of closets. I think it's dark enough. Could you find your way back to Pertisau? Without you? Are you crazy? I told Mespelbrunn I was coming back. That goes for me, too. Wait a minute. Look, they're out again. They've got a dog this time. They're taking sides to cut us off. Come on. What about the dog? We'll have to take a chance on that. Come on. Richard! Get down, Fran. On your face. Von Aschenhausen must have heard that scream. Which way do we go? We have a chance to get back to the house. Can you make it? Yes, I'm all right now. Fran, you stay here. I'll get back as soon as I can. I'm the most persistent guide, am I not? What in the name of Judas are you doing here? My friends in Vienna are deeply concerned About Dr. Mespelbrunn's health. I'm a kind of visiting physician. His English friends are also concerned About his condition. Yes. I know. Come. I have this almost open. We'd better carry him. No, no, no. Give me a minute. I'll be all right. We haven't much time, my friend. I can make it. Just give me a hand. Wait a minute. Did your wife's hat arrive safely? A little battered, but the rose still blooms. And they are still waltzing in Vienna, doctor. I'm very glad to see you gentlemen. We're glad to see you, Dr. mes... Smith. Just call me Smith. I was told it was easy to find you, Dr. Smith, But it hasn't been exactly a paper chase. Darling, this is Dr. Smith. Mrs. Myles, doctor. Doctor, in the glove compartment You will find some beauty salve. Try it. It will make you less conspicuous. Under the seat you will find a small junk shop. I advise a change of costume. You first, Mrs. Myles. Mr. Myles will watch the road behind, And I'll... Well, I'll watch only the road ahead. Are you sure this man Schultz can get us passports? Certainly. He makes beautiful passports. That's his trade. Yes, but what about money? All of ours is at the hotel. Oh, don't worry. I'll find enough for your fares to Italy. After that, you can call on your consul. Thomas Reichmann, Stefan Rudinger, And Bernard Lubeck. Those names must reach Whitehall without delay. And if I fail? After all, there is a possibility. You'll not fail. I understand. Remember, those names, and only those names, Are the ones that can be trusted. Yes, sir. How's that? Perfect. Good. We're almost in Jenbach. I leave you here. There's just one more thing. I'm relying on you To get this back to the foreign office. I think you know what it is. If they catch you, You must somehow destroy it. Good-bye. God bless you both. Good-bye, doctor. Bye, doctor. That's Innsbruck right ahead. Tomorrow at 11:00 At the Franciscan church, then. I'll meet you there with the money for sure. Incidentally, you are a good guide. Thank you. Do you remember the directions? First turn to the left, Second to the right, Two blocks down the Heinstrasse, Half a block to the right, Franschoss. Here they come. Duck. All clear. Let's go. I, uh, I guess we better follow The custom of the country. Like so? First pleasant custom I've found in Germany. Excellent. I'll bet you've never seen anyone That looks worse than their passport picture. Never. You do. Thank you, darling. Dry them and put them in the passports. It is time you were on your way to the church. Yes. Yes, I had better be going. It is not for you To go to the church, Mr. Myles. A woman will be less noticeable. Why? Men in Germany are too busy for religion. There's no law against it. No, but those who have time to go to church Are very well observed. I don't mind going in the least. No, darling. I've decided to go. What you decide is a matter Of no interest to us, Mr. Myles. I'm protecting not alone you, But my wife and myself. Mrs. Myles will collect the money. You will take the Milan train at 2:15 From the city station. When you leave the church, You will take the bus line To Gaerschoff station And join your husband on the Milan train Which stops there at 2:40. What if one of us Should miss the train? Then we hope the best for you. But I must ask you not to return here. I can do no more for you. I'm sorry, but it is necessary To protect myself So I can be of service to others. I see. He's quite right, darling. Quite right. Good-bye, Herr Schultz. Good-bye. Good-bye, Frau Schultz. We can never thank you enough. You can thank us by being most careful. Yes, I shall. I'll be thinking of Gaerschoff station While you're away. Think of something with a prettier name. Dover. Or Oxford. Home. Oh, just in case something should happen, I better tell you the names That have to get to Whitehall. I know them. Maria Kutoska, Ulrich Windler, Johann Farber, Thomas Reichmann, Stefan Rudinger, Bernard Lubeck. Good girl. See to it that nothing delays you. It so happens I'm rather fond of you. Darling, promise me you'll never grow one of those. Be careful, huh? You, too. The view of the facade from the South Is the most interesting one. It most clearly illustrates the difference Between our warm German Gothic And the more severe style Which you know in France and England. Luckily, the sun is best for us At this time of day. This way, please. Why, Mrs. Myles. What's wrong? Trouble. Mm-hmm. Gaerschoff station, 2:40. Halten sie! Halt! Halt sie! You're lucky you did not catch her, you fool. That car's from Dreikirchen. Dreikirchen. Bier und wurst, bitte. Bier und wurst, bitte. Schoen. Danke. Kaffee, bitte. Kaffee? Ja. Frances, Von Aschenhausen. Where? Dreikirchen. God help us. You know Dreikirchen? Yes. It's sort of a high school For training their elite guards. Murder. Well... At least it isn't A concentration camp. We'll need a car. Know where we can get one? If I can find my friend, I'll meet you on the Dreikirchen road. 7:00. 2 kilometers from the outskirts of Innsbruck. So I said, "yes, I'm English, "but don't ask me if there's going to be a war. I don't know. " Would you care to dance? Oh, certainly. Oh, I'm ever so sorry. It seems that even on the dance floor The English will not give us living room. Calm yourself. We were Miles apart. Miles apart, indeed. Yes, I will trouble you To lower your voice. Oh! Will you please try to follow? I don't know what you're doing. It certainly isn't the tango. And you're no gentleman. Quite a training school, huh? We're in luck. There's a big party rally in town tonight. They passed me an hour ago. The only cover seems to be the bushes And the chapel. I'll go ahead and see if it's clear. Good luck. So far, so good. Well done, sir. Now, let's see what the cook is cooking. Ooh! Where is your husband? I've told you again and again, And if you bring Goering, Goebbels, and Himmler in here, The answer will still be the same. Italy. That will not be necessary. I shall recognize the truth When I hear it. That will be quite a novelty. So he went to Italy and left you here? Yes. You're a poor liar, Mrs. Myles. Where is he? Ach! This grows tedious. Try a little more of your persuasion, Kurt. Was ist das? Hassie, answer the phone. Yeah. Ja? Hier Von Aschenhausen. Gestapo headquarters at Innsbruck. Say the girl has confessed. The husband and two others are heading for the Swiss border. They must be stopped. Gut. Was? Heil Hitler. I imagine anyone will have a job Getting into Switzerland tonight. Does anyone smell something burning here? Here's a gestapo seal and a gestapo pass. That should do for the Italian border guards. We'll give it a try. Come on. They'll have a viking's funeral, huh? It's too good for them. Where's Thornley? Thornley! Thornley! Thornley! He finished his job. I guess that's about as much As any of us can ask nowadays. Get in the back seat on the floor, Fran. There goes the evidence. Like the good old days of the Reichstag, huh? Heil Hitler! Halten sie! Halten sie! Halten sie! Heil Hitler! Viva Mussolini! O.K., Fran. All right. Well, how about some spaghetti?
