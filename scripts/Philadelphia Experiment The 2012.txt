Depends on what you think of as good, ice cream is good, as well as pizza. Down the street, at the pizzeria, pizza is better than sex. Prijedor to the point. You're telling me that the device work? I tell you that we are, in fact I I changed warfare in the 21st century. All systems are run, we deliver exactly test vehicle. My Car? - Kathey Relax, it is the company car. Okay people, take place. On. Strength at 240 percent. Run-Gaussian process. I guess that's all safe? -More or less. -24 Tesla. Without effects. -Go on, No giving up now. Now. -I hope you know what you're doing. Abracadabra. Impressed? We perform izvlaenje rabbit out of a hat. ? -Still working on that. Bring him back. Turn off the generator. Good work, Doctor. -Please, a good deal? We found more strongly adhesive already invisibility. Field is destabilizing...  Who's that? -Hell... - Losing power...  started the process. 19 km west from Philadelphia b/  / b Here Ventage 354, seeks permission to take off.  Again, here Ventage 354, I ask permission to take off. Ventage 354, have permission.  The car is gone! Magnetic field strength falls. But it's okay. Not over yet? Monthly car is no longer delayed. -Yes! Lena, this is the last time you change things to count. You with me. I do not understand why you drink it trash. We work in cafes, for God's sake. I gave up caffeine when I was pregnant with my first. You should try it. -Your coffee or of pregnancy? Both. I'd like to see the strife child. -Surely she would like.

Excuse me, duty calls. - Get them. I'll see you tonight? I'll think about it. -Thank you, Lena. How on earth resolve this? -I am a genius. Board will need a better answer. True, that the 1943rd Done great things. Do not It looks like to you that you share the credit. -I do not share. Menu remains patent. It's about time. -Explain to me what this is about. See for yourself. Dr. Falkner... -Not now, Ramey. -I know where the voice came. Great. Solve it. -S razaraa Eldridge. Eldridge ? This is a ship. -That's what I'm saying. Are crazy enough to do do so. -How did he get there? Where would I know. I heard blow, and the damn thing is created here! Destroyer Eldridge. It was Eldridge. Otpremnie, we are in serious need backup. Call... Call the National Guard. Call the Navy too. Are you serious, Carl?  Here is the destroyer II. World War II on the runway. What? Salinger? Salinger? Salinger, if you hear... Generator is broken. What? Hello! Do you hear me? O'Hara! Come on guys! Eldridge was scrapped after the experiment and disconnected It was renamed Leon. -Course. Why is it in the middle of Pennsylvania? How did you keep documents? - 've Got all necessary. -Apparently not. What happened to Eldridge in the water? Eldridge and his crew went missing during the experiment Ship did not show up. If this Eldridge, in the wake of are doing something bigger than invisibility. I need all the documents. I see Eldridge. In life seen anything like that. Carl, uope it does not make sense. Eldridge? -I just stare at him. Here it is the middle of the road. Help -Wait... Anybody?  Hello, you hear me? Any survivors, I'll call you later . -What? Carle, wait. Carla! O Lord! Power is off , is not it? -You should be. I do not act like that. Can you believe this? Where is Carl? -He disappeared into the ship. What do you mean? - In the bloody ship. Here Reed. Do you hear me? As he entered the ship? Here Reed. Who hear me?  It has worked for me. Carla, can you hear me? Like I said...  What about you? Watch where you walk!  Operator? Connect me with 5-2-7-0-0... Please insert 25 cents.  Help me... Please insert 25 cents.

Are you still there?  thereby to serve you, Captain? Lieutenant. -All right, Lieutenant. How may I help you? I'd like a cup of coffee, please. Late, espresso, cappuccino, decaf ? -Usual. Of course. If you are in trouble, please contact Navy... How to do? I would check the website. - Web page? -The best way, is not it? I do not want clever, but this is Springview... Springview, Pennsylvania? Yes. Lost? No, I did not. 's Just not the way I remember. Mary Gardener Do? Billings Road? Molly Gardener. Working here, but not in now. 's Day. How much do I owe? -2.25 Dollars. -Maker? Yes. You will pay for this? -Thank you for your kindness. Do you want coffee? -I. Do? Safe? Ased to call? (Validation process) Eldridge disappeared. Is caused ekploziju and disappeared. Ased?

A soldier asking about your grandmother. For Grandma? Yes, and he wanted to contact Navy . What are you talking about? He said the Lieutenant.  Are you okay, honey? You seem a bit odd. Yes, Ramey. Say you have something . Not yet.  We saw images of tests, but we do not have an explanation. New problem is that generator and consumes energy. -Where? Not know. - Go to the back door and shut it.  're getting something. Generator to 15 tesla. CHICAGO / b What? Moore. Yes. Eldridge appeared in Chicago.  Are you sure? Yes. - Send everything you have. We're changing destination. Turn us. Promptly at Chicago! -What happened? Eldridge returned. MISSING destroyer / b local man disappeared in the Experiments NAVY / b Hi. You Molly? Do not you? I'm sorry I frightened you. Can I, please, have a seat? I'm sorry... I know. We bought this house, when I married your grandmother. She was pregnant. I had to return to duty six days after the birth of your mother. That was two weeks ago. -Seventy years ago. Where is Anny? Where is your mother? Anny, my mother died three years ago. Here is spent aII life and raised me. My grandmother died when I was little. Not stop and look. How is possible? How come you're here? Something with a device on board was wrong. I need some help in order to understand, someone who was familiar with the program. Halo ? Lena, is not really a moment... Molly, has to do with the ship,  S boat? -On, TV, I saw something amazing.  interrupt this program for a report from Chicago.  go live Katy, with a report on the situation where you are located.  ... building behind me...  -Oh, my God. What do we know? -The boat is being protected electromagnetic field. Same as in our project Gray Watch. -Where did you know that? I'm incredibly smart. Direct transfer of matter. -What does that mean? Current transfer of matter between two points in space and time. In English. -Okay. Here is the Eldridge According to confidential information, thank you Miss Moore crew of the Eldridge in the water activate the generator which overloaded and blotted ship. However, the Navy has made a mistake, ship did not explode, but rather a created a very strong field, which has disrupted gravity. How? - Is outstretched in time and space. Eldridge failed. Where? It's not "where", but rather "when". When we run our generator, our field is linked to the original. Merged and like magnets, drawn to the Eldridge through time and space, show up here. Today. It's been 70 years. - For Us. For the moment the ship. Theoretically, we can reverse the procedure , return the ship in time and create a new history. II interrupted. St.. war, before points. -Enough. I want to know how the ship from Springview ended up in Chicago. Philadelphia's experiments - PROJECT DEBT / b Navy after the war concluded case and sold the technology Gray Watch. What is Gray Watch? Impasse. Developing weapons. The best insurance in the world. 's Largest and most powerful almost government corporations in the country. Surely "level" . How do you know all this? I, like a, hackers. -Hackers? -Hacker. Zarauje so? Say it is not "level" . We have footage from the cameras. Determined the identity of the survivor. -William Gardener. The technician Salingerovog team. If he's alive, we need here. Thank you, Doctor. It did not occur to me. The matter is settled. The best I can... Something wrong? I would not hold a lecture. Is it appropriate to have male clothes at home? A lot of things have changed since the 40's. Carl and I are're engaged, so... As we are... Always pushing. If on the ship... -He's alive. I know. Miss Gardener, I'm from the government, can I ask you a few questions? Of course you can. Just to say hello. Just to... I'll be right back. -No problem. Hello? Listen to me very carefully.  're mortal danger.  Yes. It's great. Anybody else is wrong with you? -course. Listen, take Bill to the booth.  I'll call there. Do not have much time. -Good. Bye. Important call? -I. Friend. Course. Can I get a glass of water? -Course. Are you from office in the government? Funny. People almost never watch badge. Really irresponsible. Do... Here you go. Gardener Where is Bill? There you are! Look at me. Are you okay? Yes. -Good. Come on. The unit is in position.  This is a scientific problem. It will solve my people! -They took us into this mess! I talked to superiors. This is a military problem and they will solve it. Clearly ? -What would do? Shoot the building? The unit is headed. Get ready people.  Arm yourself. Here we go...  ... people in Chicago, the nation and around the world iekuju what will happen...  Molly, I... -I need help! What is it? -I do not have time to explain. I need your car. -Okay. I need some money. Are you in trouble? -I would not have believed it. Thank you. Here we go. We arrive at the 17th -Roger for 17  We have a picture, guys! -Go!  Do? Reece said. - Put it on loudspeaker. Tell. Generators are still active. -Will skoiti again? -Yes. Oitanja are larger than it anticipated ... -vance to the point. Field strength is much was greater than in Springview. Springview was hilarious, This will be a disaster. people's happening again! Earn reward, Sergeant! -Understood. You did not hear me? Gonna kill all them all! -I want people on the boat, before you Jump. Hello! Hello! Bill Gardener? Yes, who is it? I know for Eldridge.  Bill, what's going on? I'm sorry, but it is closing. Bill Seeking Gardener. -I do not know who it is. Try again. Seeking Molly Gardener. I can not help you. Are you sure about that?

Something's going on Bill! I do not know what! Listen to me carefully. Remember these two words : Ivory Gate.  What does this mean? He'll know.  Bill! How are you? Are you okay? -Get away from me! -What's going on? I do not know! The consequences for the ship! Skoit will! -Energy is critical! Come on Molly! Why are we stopping? My phone- . I have a message. O Lord! -What? -Called Carl! So he's alive! We're Carla. Leave a message.  Damn! - Are you sure that's on the board? -Safe! If you want to see again Carla, we must continue! Molly? -Good. These are most likely location next event. This narrows thing. Yes, of course. Ten worldwide locations. It's great! This is now an international problem. , Miss Moore. - Give me the Ministry of Defence. Delta team, you can take off . Good luck.  Where are we going? The Morton- Salinger. The one-Salinger? Yes. That's not possible. He dead. -So yesterday was me. I set a deadline. Brings up to 8 hours. OK, Falkner. At last you have the facts. More to put you to bed. Yes I settled into bed? 'll Destroy the ship when it appears. -Word is a powerful EMP. You'll shell it? That ship has gone. Immediately. The best and only way I know how. Any explosion will be rejected and tougher Do you have a better idea? -I need more time. Do it until you start shelling. We are in the right place? -Yes. How do I look after all these years ? A little worse than then. Hi. You look young. You do not. Reece? Yeah? Immediately Off-generator. Disconnect before him Morse Pipi shell. Or we can not avoid disaster. Understand. I'll try.  I do not care do you want to break it. Only it turned off. I understand. You know Bill, play with unimaginable force. If you did not go back, I knew I I made a terrible mistake. Then I decided to bring this technology into grave. How it got Gray Watch? - for the Ministry of Defence. They wanted to hire me. Faked your death? -Such persons should not refuse. Guess who called. Old friend Bill Gardener. Morton Salinger. Salinger was dead. -Apparently not. Recognized his voice. What you got? - Call of Salinger. He left a message. Ivory Gate. Ivory-Gate? What he, on earth does that mean? I have no idea.  I will send my people. And Hagen, I want these people live if you can. Dead... that's not bad. Dead? -Understood.  'll kill people who have developed devices to Eldridge in the water? -They are the enemy. We need them. Have knowledge about the project. Salinger came to us, that he wanted to help. I am the only survivor. The others... Connected with the ship. Where have you been? -I followed generator operation. Must be something. Generator is tied for the atoms of the body Eldridge. Because I feel the consequences when they are jumping ship. -Right. Ramp suddenly ends, check the length / b What if you later get on the ship? -Why? -My boyfriend did it. I'm sorry, but this no one can survive. Alive. He called. -I see? I can watch it. We have to be very careful. This reminds me of the first steps on the ice . Can I drive. Yes. Go ahead. Be careful. The circuit is interrupted at Ruen izvlaenju. -Roger. What are oitanja? -Stable. Below the limit. Do? -We have a big problem. What's going on? -out! -God, what's happening? Out! -Reece! Come on! Miite it! Go! -Reece! Bill, is that get you back to the ship. -Why? source. Eldridge mean? -No. On me. I am connected to a generator. Part I formation of connections. -You're the only one who can stop. Found us. Do the people still middle finger? Yeah, why not? Duck! -Get in the woods! Straight that way. Duck! Hold on, going through ! Do not! -Lord! Do not you say no phone? -This is different. Front is mined. My name laboratory. Phone! Damn! Where is...? Where's the catch? -Close, but I need a phone! At the crossroads we are! -Turn left! Molly, look at the by phone with your seat. Do you see it? -Yes. -Fast! Get him! I got it! Here! Come on, Salinger! Where is it? -In front of us! Stop! Hold it! Morton, Morton? He's bleeding! O Lord! Was shot! We got to the hospital! Morton! Listen to me... You have to go on that ship. Not much time... -I can not live without you. There is a team that is loyal to me. We were looking for a way to stop this. First... You and the ship, you back in 1943. How? There Investigative institutions outside Granger. 's Named after me. -I know where he is. Look for Canadians. Completing my work, as agreed. Gotta go! I can not. -You! Get out of here! I'm glad I saw you again . -Me too, mate. 's Right, Molly. We gotta go. OK. Here it is. Hagen, is it over? Damn! I will shut the entire territory! Approach the target at 400 miles.  Almost and the time. -They will not succeed. Status will only get worse! Damn if Let's do nothing! This is the Gardener. He did this. Gardener is unstable, and damn boat. The second time will be even worse. Bill Gardener's solution. A Salinger knows where he's going. I'll be damned if I will not tell Katheryn Moore. Take me to the airport. Now. I understand. Let me play the fool: of laughter and longing,  let's face shrivels.  Where did they go? Which way? I do not know. I did not get a good look. Some idiot shot me. You may have. SAHARA, 240 km from the Algerian border / b We need to cross. -Up is certainly the way. Here we go. Not good. Approach the target.  Give codes pilots. Inbox water.  Where Falkner? I should see with pure mess. No where to cross. -I. Kilometers away. Without transportation, no time to lose. Camper. When you search, will be safe to hide there. Water, approach the target...  target is visible. -go. Delta-Bravo, you have permission.  Come on. Some kind of field protects the ship.  Delta squad is gone. -I do not understand. Delta waters, report. -Delta water, you hear me. WEST COAST OF ENGLAND / b Coming report on the damage. Eldridge dropped a nuke on in England. Where is he now? I do not know. -A Falkner? I do not know. Nadite my dr. Falkner, now. Institute SALINGER / b This is the place. Where are they? -I do not know. Come on. Hello? Anybody? Kane? DR CA / b No, no. Do not look... Come on, let's go. Wait. -Molly, what...? Come on! Stop! -Run, run! Come on, come on. Gardener? Surrender Gardener I'll be quick. -No! Molly! There's nowhere to go! Surrender and I'll let Molly. I'm here! -What are you doing? Leave her alone! Let her go. I do not need it, leave it. Please. -I do not think so. Molly, are you okay? -Just a scratch. Get in! -Who are you? - One of few people who does not want you dead. Okay. Scratches. Will ye well. All right. Suggestions? Prevent this if we come over to the boat and get back to the past. I agree. This is a problem. How? -Salinger understood. 's Why I took this. Do the research? -Yes. -Great. More to come to the data. I can do it. She's hackers, whatever that meant. I entered. -What do you have? So I make a program: Two points are generators. Yes.  Now what? -Now we ship to find. Not. The ship will find us. Course. Got another phase generator. -Right. The Gray Watch . -Let's get the horse in the barn. Can I help you? -Actually, you can. I just found out that my car in Granger. If you tell me about Falknerovom plan, I'll blow your brains all over the wall. Here we are. That's it. Stations. As soon as we get Salingerov program, we bring Eldridge here. And when the generator starts. -I can not help you with that. Ploe circuit, field, magnetic flux. Voltage is there. Sure you know what you're doing, because... Good. It looks different, but the Hertz Hertz and volts are volts. "ON" still means INVOLVED? -Yes. It's true. O.K. Gaussian control here. I will deal with frequency. Molly, run the program. Scrolling. Tesla 35 and growing. Quickly! -Slow down. The system can not handle it. Are you okay? Bill? Is associated with the ship. Incredible. We did it! Are you okay? -Good. Better- he would. We're not done yet. O Lord my God! It will not be easy to board. How deep is the building? - Has three sub-levels. Affiliated staircase. Finish already. I'll go with you. -I. Impossible. Carl was on board. -I'll find it. You stay here, next to the boat. No! -Molly... You need to stay here. -I do not want to lose you. You will not. Let's keep in touch. Hi Falkner. I'm impressed. You did lead ship. This happens when you stop the killing of . Nades solution. Do not fussing, getting... Verified. Here is . Some pilots start. Get away from the controls. We know how to stop it . Let us finish. She said to step back. Where's your friend? Falkner, Molly, you hear me? I found the entrance to the ship.  It'll still see -Hagen. This time it dokraji. Stop. We're all gonna die. All the time in this way. We need to fix this. Take documents, research, equipment, let us first finish. Let me help the man. Decent offer. But I have a simple commandment to destroy the ship, evidence, keep technology. What exactly do. quit the program, we'll lose Eldridge. Will blow the planet to bits. -It will not. For ten minutes, the boat, the institution all of you, you will not be a problem. Yes, we removed it. -Again, you're wrong. President approved a nuclear attack. You can not. -Look at me. Miite it! Molly Falkner, is there? No! I told you not to mie. -God... Falkner, better look. What does this mean? I told you... Program uitan, boat will again skoiti. Hurry! We do not have much time. Are you there? Ship is unstable, What's going on?  You. Exiting the program. -I do not listen to me! We need to restore the Eldridge. If this mess... You'll disturb time and space. We'll change at the whole history. I want us save a future. Do it! Carla? Yes? I'm here! Who are you? Molly sent me . Molly? Where is she? It's good. But we must... Departed. What are you doing? Go. Penetrations through the wall and go to the ship. Do you? I can not leave. -I can not leave. Take it in the truck! 's Time to switch off. I was looking forward to this. Listen! If you do not switch off generator, we're all going to die. If that includes you, too... Do not move! -Young lady, you will not... I will only... -I. You should have stayed dead! -Go... Take my car... -No! What about you? Salinger was right. We are not yet ready. Do you want to dance? -I... Then go. Please. Good. Get off my ship! Go. Take Molly far away. -Do not leave without you. -Go! Carle. -Hey! Are you okay? -Yes. I'm fine. -Are you sure? Where is...? Where is Bill? I have to go. No, no... Hurry! Come on! Faster! Hello! Is there anyone at home? Hi Grandpa. Hi, honey.
