Have this sweet. l won't die that quick. Until l fill this town with art. First come of out these round stairs. All of the town call you a madman. Art doesn't need town, towns need art. Whatever! Alright, l'll come again tomorrow to learn. Only if l have the right mood. Go away, you witch. You aren't doing any favor if you come to learn. l'm saying if you don't pay the bill electricity will be disconnected. Yes, it is. Go you have electricity. Let me have my food. Have it. Let's go. Why haven't you had your dinner yet? Does he ever eat without you? Mother, why did you married with this big blackmailer? You still can change yourself. Stay away from that Ajanta ''Bakwasi'' (Orap). What ''Bakwasi''? You entertain yourself with Lata Mangeshkar and Mumtaz singing. And when you daughter sings and dances, it's ''Bakwasi'' to you. What are you saying dude? Why do you talk to me like that? Are you out of your mind? There's is something as Style! You won't go to Ajanta. What are you doing aunty? Najma, don't. - l'm going. Let her go, it won't take anything if she does one program. You haven't passed through that Ajanta place. There's always voices of singing and dances coming from there. Don't know what would have been going on there? lf there are voices of dancing and singing then it must be it. We are all ready. lt's a must see. A new from Ajanta! He's back again. What are you doing? What are you doing witch? He's Steve. From National Geographic Magazine from America. He's here to take pictures of lndian artists. You too should have your photos taken. Listen, take him with you to see the town. lf you don't mind. We don't mind. How are you Mohan? l was craving for your tea today. Tea and hotel both are yours. Oome, sit. He's Mr. Steve. Oame from America? Why? Hi, l'm Steve. Why don't you bring some Pakoras with Ohili. Right away. Prepare 3 cups of tea and some Pakoras. O stupid, You'll keep on serving Pakoras and the Whiteman will fly away with the girl. We have fixed your marriage. What? With Mohan You'll finish your program by tomorrow. Mohan has prepared for the engagement on the day after tomorrow. Buy whatever you want for the occasion by tomorrow. Am l doing anything wrong? No, Art is what's coming out of your heart. And what stays in the heart is darkness. You're not born to follow this world, you're born to dance on your own heartbeats. Spread your wings and fly. Fly away my child. l called many times from America. But the phone kept on ringing. Later l found out from Najma that Mom and Papa left Shamli because of the embarrassment. Don't know where? Najma was about to get married. So she was restricted from talking to me. l called my teacher too, but no one wanted to hear his name. Don't know what people might have done to him. After going to America, Steve didn't remain the Steve l met before. Then l realized. That he and l were never meant for each other. Till then l was already pregnant. Then you came in to my life. l found a new reason to live. l forgot Shamli and started a new life in America. With the person l love most in the world. l love you mom. Thank you, l didn't know that. You took too long. He's gone. He passed away last night. He was saying, he's done with the drama of this world. He will continue in the next world. Witch! You haven't stopped being late. Have you? How are you? What's wrong? Are you mad at me? l haven't called you since all those years... l didn't tell you how l was doing and how Ajanta was? What could l tell you? Since you left... seemed like Ajanta had lost it's soul. And then gradually everyone had left Ajanta alone. Ohildren had stopped coming to Ajanta. Their parents weren't allowing them to come. They were afraid, there might be another Diya. Who could have be like you? Ajanta is finished. Look, l won't lie to you. l'm dying. How? Why? There's no use of talking about that. l don't have time for all this, neither Ajanta does. Diya, these people are trying demolish Ajanta. Just for the sake of money. An old, this old temple of art, they're trying to destroy. l and Doctor, we fought a lot. We cried a lot. We pleaded a lot. But who will listen to us? You save Ajanta. You can save Ajanta. Please save Ajanta from breaking apart. Save Ajanta. He has ordered to demolish Ajanta. Who has? Raja Sahab! Who Raja Sahab? How can he demolish Ajanta? Ajanta is the property of this town. Whole town is with him. But why? What will he get by getting Ajanta demolished? Mall something, shops and all. Mall? - Yes. Shopping mall? - Yes exactly. Raja Sahab has decided that he will build a shopping mall for the people after demolishing Ajanta. Who is Raja Sahab to decide that? His father used to be the prince of this area before lndependence. He's a Member of Parliament. He's also done some education from abroad. Now he has also won the elections. So... l will go and meet him. Don't worry. Ajanta will be safe. l need to see Mr. Uday Singh, l have an appointment. ls Mr. MP coming or not? Not MP, it's Raja Sahab. Have you told him that l'm waiting? Have you told him that l'm waiting? Uncle, it's burnt. l've been waiting here for 20 minutes. Hey, can l offer you some pizza? No, will you call your father, please? l'm afraid he can't come. lt has been 20 minutes since l'm waiting here. And it has been 3 years since he's passed away. l'm here with meet Raja Uday Singh, MP of this area. You have. Uday. You? l don't look like my father but still l'm Raja. Pizza? - No thanks. l'm Diya Srivastav. Have a seat please. l've made it myself. - Oh great. So what can l do for you? l've come from New York. lt's obvious. l wanted to talk about Ajanta Theatre with you. Right, those ruins? That's not ruins. You are not political. Right? l'm a dancer. l'm a choreographer. From New York. All l want to say is that place is not for shopping. lt's for theatre. So, when did the theatre held there last time? Madam Many Non-resident lndians come here every years. They do the welfare work for a couple of months and go back. You too do the same. Don't interfere with the town plans. So you'll remove the heritage of this town for the sake of your mall. Without thinking and understanding anything. The day when people start feeding with heritage, l'll let you run the theater. Till then let me do it in my own way. Anything else l can do for you? - So is it all about feeding people? Don't they need anything else? Being together, having fun, To have happiness of doing something together. Does that happen at your Ajanta? lt used to be. lf people aren't coming to the theater, that tells they don't want to come. What if l bring people in? l will bring people in Ajanta. All of Shamli. l'll get my team from New York. Best dancers, stage designers. Lights, music, l'll do lndia's biggest show ever. No problem. Then? What? Then what? What do you mean? You and your team will go back to New York after one show. Only remain will be the ruins of Ajanta. The way it has always been. Yes, it would seem ruins to you. What could be expected from you. A person who's today's foreign educated MP. You think you're damn good. Don't you? You think you know everything. You can... You can change the world. l'll make you a deal. Do you want do a show? Do it. But not with the people from New York. But with the people of Shamli. Every dancer. Actor. Singer should be from Shamli. lf you succeed in doing a show like that, Ajanta is yours. What? All excitement gone? All right. This show will be held. And it will be the way you asked. Not with the people from New York. Here, with the people of Shamli. Every singer, actor, dancer... will be from Shamli. Think again, demolition is in 2 months. Ok. Done. But you'll loose. l've never lost till today. l too have never been defeated. No problem. Your first defeat would be a gift from me. See you in two months. Listen. You haven't eaten pizza. How will you do this show? ln a town that people even don't want to hear your name. How will you do that show? l'm sorry child. l have to tell you what's truth. You should be wise. lf l wasn't wise, l wouldn't have come here. And what's wise in what's going to happen to this town? Forget this town. This town has never missed you. And yet you're trying to be a relative to this town. l am a relative of this town. No matter what people think. But this is the same town and people are same too. We'll see. This town.. and the people of this town. l will definitely get the show held. And that with these very people. You will see that. Let's go home. Ooming, coming. lf you were a bit more late... l would have called for another maid. l'm Diya. This used to be my house. We used to live here many years ago. But it's our home, we bought it from Mr. Srivastav. Yes, he was my father... He is... You... You... will you have some water? l'll have some coke. Shut up Radha. Yes, why not child. Oome, she's so sweet. Please come. Room on rent? l suggest you give her the room. l hope you will not claim your right on this house. No, absolutely not. When you've purchased this house, who am l to claim my right. Absolutely right. Look. You'll give an affidavit on Rs. 20 stamp paper that you'll stay here only on rent and will never claim any rights on this house. No problem. Breakfast, luck, dinner, what we eat will be served to you. And drinking water will be for free. Absolutely free. - Will it be safe? No problems. And no gentlemen in the house please. l hope you don't have many male friends. l'm not that lucky. Luck is to be opened if you want. There's a key to every heart. lf you try you can find it. Ok the deal is done. l'm getting late for official work. Have a good day and good luck. - Good day. l've heard a lot about you. Not something good. lt's not like that. People would say one thing or the other. lt's theirjob. lt's her. Who? Her. Where did she come from? l used to know her father. That poor fellow had to leave the town. She put the whole town on fire with her dance. She's a proved heartbreaker. Now what she's going to do? What else? She'll dance, it's written. lf she'll dance, what's so big. Sir, whenever Diya dances, everyone goes mad. l will definitely go to see her dance. Mom, what have you put on the wall? Sugar! My teacher used to say... if you want to invite flies, you must have to put some sweet. Mom, everyone in this town hates you. No Not everyone. Oome on, let's go. Where? To someone who loves me the most. Are you being shy to hug me? How are you Diya? l'm fine. How are you? l'm good. What brought you here? What brought me here? Farooq, she's Diya, Mr. Srivastav's daughter. He's my husband. So, you are Diya. She's my daughter, Radha. Say hello. ln Hindi Hi child. lt's ok, we too understand English a bit. Your husband? - He was... They are divorced. They what? They're divorced. Actually... People who run once, always keep on running. Shall we go? Ok Diya, l have some work to do. ls there anyone else in this town who loves you? Oome let's dance, Shamli. Oome let's play, Shamli. Sit down and keep quite. Thank you very much. That you have come to Ajanta. And raised the pride of your own Ajanta Theater. For that millions of congratulations. Applause. l invited you all here not only for the show. As you all are aware that in your town Ajanta Theatre is going through a difficult time. Administration is going to demolish Ajanta Theatre to build some shops. You tell me, is it right thing to do? Just do another dance if you can, we are not interested in your lecture. l understand what's your opinion about me. But it's not about me. lt's a fight. That people of Shamli will fight together. That's why after 2 months from now... A show about Laila Majnu will be held in Ajanta A show that... no one had ever seen or heard till now. Because performers of this show would be from all of you. She wants to make us jokers too. From tomorrow, we all will take out one hour from our work. To do the rehearsal of this show. We will show the whole world. That Shamli has the potential of music, dance and art. She's wasting our time. One of you will play ''Laila'' Someone will play ''Majnu'' Someone will play Laila's mother. and someone will play Majnu's friend. lf you're playing Laila then l'll play Majnu. Agreed? They are insulting her. And that way by doing the hard work for 2 months. We will show the anti-Ajanta people that until this sun and moon are there Shamli will still have Ajanta. Not in good way. Nice, this town really loves you a lot. So have you understood? You've got the answer from Shamli. You've also saved your two months. Not bad. When are you going back? Who told you that l'm going back? Why? What's more to happen? Shamli will gather and till show will run. And you'll watch it too. l think you'll enjoy it. So you won't listen. l will, if you do. Best of luck Ms. Diya, l think you need it. Maybe you'll need it, Raja Sahab. That was nasty. lt's a fight. Fights are nasty. You dance very well. l know. What do you think? Will her show run? Why do you come here? To make me angry. That's my job. l'm a policeman. l have to keep the conditions of people's hearts. So, you will never go there. Right? To Ajanta. Even if my shoe goes there, you can change my name. The search for the performers of Laila Majnu in Ajanta has started. lf you want to become an actor. Make yourself look good and get yourself ready. Oome tomorrow morning at 10 at Ajanta. Oome for sure. They're ruining Ajanta. - What? What are you doing? What are you doing? Are you mad? Why are you doing this? You should have asked us before doing this dance and all. Get aside. Don't you have any manners? Where're those Laila Majnu? Where's petrol? He's gone to bring that. Bring the firewood here. Finish this Ajanta or whatever it is. Since you were a child... l even know your father. Look what they're doing? - Don't stop them. What happened? Didn't you see him? - What? Majnu, he's right there. But they're breaking the stage. - We had to break the stage anyway. lt's good that we will save the charges to break it. But have you seen him? Are you mad? Doctor, Majnu is right there. Let's talk to him. You're out of your mind. Hey Vidya, just finish this. What's your name? What will you do with my name? Go away. Hey, all of you go away from here. Or we'll break your legs. Will you play ''Majnu''? You must have participated in plays in school etc. You're educated, right? Old man, take care of her. Or l'll get you both cremated right here. Let's go Diya. But something you must have done. Like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Ba Ba Black Sheep, etc. Why have you guys stopped. Keep on breaking. Get a drink for him. He must be tired. How much you paid for the haircut? What's this? ls it funny to you? O Madam! Listen carefully. l won't repeat that. The dance culture that you brought from America. We won't allow that to run here. Who brought that from America. l took that from here to America. You can't find Majnu's like you in America. So you're still the same. Hello Ohoudhry Sahab. Hello son. l knew your father. l saw what you did to him. l'm also watching what you're doing now. lt's not acceptable in Shamli. Ohoudhry Sahab, so these boys are yours. Haven't you heard what l said? Oan we talk in private for two minutes? Just two minutes. Break it. You keep on breaking. What happened to the drink? Please come. What's this rubbish? - Please come. l've heard that elections are coming and you're contesting? So? - l want you to win. Will l loose if you don't want? No sir, your enemies must loose. There must a be a lot. l know how to deal with enemies. But you don't have an issue to raise this time. Why? That Uday Singh has left no issue to raise. Water! ln every home. lt's there whenever you open tap. Electricity! Always on. He didn't even left the roads. He builds them before the break. Hindu Muslims are living in peace already. Even the college is already running well. You don't have to worry about me. l know how to raise an issue. Put it on fire. Ohoudhry Sahab, issue is right there. You yourself are ignoring it. What issue? This... Ajanta. This? A dance place? No Sir, Art, culture and music. lt's our country's heritage. Will there shops be built on the ruins of our heritage? That too on the state land? Our heritage is being attacked and you're just watching. No. Please have it. - l can't watch that. Sir, you have the issue in hand, and election is coming. Let the kite fly. lt will be Ajanta issue. But what do you want? - Majnu. What? Diya. - What? Given, Majnu is given. Shamli is shaken as we've found our Majnu. Oleric's son is going to perform as Majnu. Ooming to entertain you the young man lmran Pathaan. And he's looking for his Laila. lt's not fair. You challenge first then you cheat. Do l cheat? Liar. l will beat your like anything. You start calling you mom as your aunt. What did you say? - You'll hear better if l slap you. She abused. l didn't No l didn't That was an abuse. That was a full abuse. She said mother... l said mom as your aunt. That could have been a misunderstanding. lt couldn't be an abuse. You keep on playing in street. lmran has already become Majnu for a play in Ajanta. Why? How would l know? All girls of Shamli are ready to be his Laila. No one can be lmran's Laila. l will put Ginger powder in their nose. So you love him too much. Should l rip my heart open? No, this acting won't work. Then? Dance is required. Laila must know how to dance. Dance? Not even my lice had ever danced. Next Stop That's enough. l already knew, it will be me. Go home and help your mom in house chores. You should play in the street. You can't be lmran's Laila. l will hit you with my shoe, you'll become an old man. Tabrez No. 1 l'm Tabrez, Laila's brother. l'm brother-in-law, l won't give you bad advice. At least you get yourself insured. l got Tabrez. Him? How he'll play Tabrez? l don't need a gangster. l need a brother. He will definitely play Tabrez. Why are you stopping? She wants to be Laila's mom. Really? Will you do the part of Laila's mom? No Am l really good? Oan l do it? Why not? What are you doing in my house? She can't play any Laila's mom? Why? - Why? Because l'm saying. You see, l'm a responsible government officer. lf my wife plays in a show, what my respect will be in office? He's right. lf l play in the show he'll loose his respect. lf l play in the street, he'll loose his respect. lf l eat something in market, he'll loose his respect. Even if l breathe, he'll loose his respect. Because there are only two people who live in our house. Him and his respect. And l? l'm just another file in his life. He can open it and close it whenever he wants. My life is full of boredom. Because l've married to world's most boring person. l had to say something to you. Whatever happened today at my home because of you... No, let me speak. Because you my wife denied to follow my instructions for the 1st time. For the first in the 10 years.. it got known to everyone that not everything is fine in my marital life. For the first time in my life... my wife called me as the most boring person in the world. That was all because of you. lt's was right, whatever happened. l am a boring person. But l don't want to remain a boring person. Specially not in front of my wife. So l've come to apply for post in your cultural program. You were saying there are some vacancies still vacant. Help me change myself from being bored in front of my wife. lt's my humble request to you. lf you let me join your play without telling my wife... so l will... Just help me save my marriage. l've also brought it in writing. Why not? Thank you. Shop's closed, but the gate's opened. Then get your daughter wrap the gate. Should l close the gate? There's not a single Laila in whole of Shamli. What happened to Laila's father? What about that Khalifa with a beard. Who? From the Parsi Theater? No way. No Laila, no Laila's mom, no Laila's father... You leave the worry of Laila's father. l've solved this problem. l won't let you struggle alone. For Laila's father, l will be the perfect performer. Why are you bothering sir? We will find someone. Why will you find someone when you already have one. Yes, why will we find someone Perfect. She's here again. Why doesn't anyone stop her? Who can stop her? Listen, you can't play Laila. Go home. Why not? You don't have that thing. Why not? Try me l have practiced everything. Oome here. lt's not about practice. What we're looking for in Laila, that's not in you. Go What are you saying Madam, let me know what you're looking for. l will bring it out. What will you bring out? Have looked at yourself? You don't know how to speak, walk, dance or sing? From what angle you look like Laila? How dare you thought that you could play Laila? How dare l? So now you'll decide who can do what? You will decide everything. No matter if someone lives or die. Even if someone dies out of love for someone. Bring water. Get up Why do you want to play Laila? lf l won't, someone else will. lf someone else will play. lmran will fall for her. Then what will l do? He won't fall only by playing Laila. What if he does? Do you love him that much? His love is nothing compared to mine. Does he know? How would he know, he's just an ass. Should l tell him? No, l'll faint right now. You won't tell him yet you love him. How this will work? That's the confusion l'm stuck in. So, you're here to get out of this confusion. Yes, or what else? l was too stuck in a confusion once like you. Do you know what l did? What? - Exactly what you're doing? l did my best and forgotten everything. Oan you put your all strength in to it? Are you referring to play in the show? You'll have to work too hard. l only know the hard work. l'm not good at intellect. Won't you give up in middle? Those who love can't break. Do you know what was special about Laila? What? This! Her courage. Tomorrow exactly at 1 1 o'clock in the morning All the actors of the story of Laila and Majnu will be presented Ajanta Theatre welcomes you to see your own artists.

There's a problem You play Laila's father. No. - Oome. What makes fire and fire and water to dry. That's called love. For the people of Shamli, by the people of Shamli, ''Laila Majnu'' lt's a story about a town. But what town, we don't know. What we know is that they used to be together Be it night or day. What day or what night? We don't know that. The thing we know is that the teacher was asking him to learn the lesson of God Write down ''Allah'' He writes, ''Laila'' l said ''Allah'' Laila, Laila, Laila You will go to hell that you keep on saying Laila. That you compare Allah with a human being. Give me your hand And other one too.. Don't hit him lt hurts. Don't hit him. Look at this small shaking fist. Relieve him. lt hurts, don't hit him. lt's strange, is it from God or the scheme of devils. That these little ones are suffering He's magician, don't go near him. Make them stay apart. ls it some magic or some curse. Oall someone to protect him. Make them stay apart. The childhood flew away with the kites. Heart started to feel the youth. You low life, l will cut your hand. You don't know who you touched. She's mine. l will get you to your grave. lf l don't, my name's not Tabrez. She's mine. lt's enough You touch body of a stranger. Stop your fist. You slapped her. Who's my love, my prayer. Who's everything to me. Who's tears of priceless. Qais is saying, she's my Laila. You dare? - lt's courage. Your movement? - lt's strength. Stop it woman. l'm not kind anymore. l dig his grave. Think about that. But there will be two bodies. Thank about that. l swear, l will finish this today. Majnu is crazy that he killed. He will be stoned till death. That's the law. Laila shouted with courage. lf it is inevitable, l will marry to someone else. But let Majnu go out of the town. That stones are tired too. l'm giving my body to someone but my soul remains with you. Keep it safe with you. l swear if someone comes to touch my body, he will find dust only. Future will witness That the God will come on earth to put flowers on our graves. Look, look sir, your wife. Sometimes you don't know the worth of yourjewel. l said thatjust being an ignorant. Truth is if you weren't there... Then? - Then l wasn't alive. Thank you. Should l tell? - Yes. You're a great... A great Majnu. And you're a great twist. You've always ignored my mistakes. And l kept on doing them. The girl whom l married and accepted as a gift from God l was using her for my business. l should be cursed. lt's true. l should be cursed. Whatever you and your friends did... lf this art dies because of the mall. There should be no mall at all. Shall we go? What happened? l won't do this play again. Because of me? Yes What have l done now? l can't see you die everyday. Don't say like this. l'm telling you or... Or... Or l will die. Are you at peace now? Ajanta is safe now, teacher. You were wrong doctor. Everyone in this town is my relative. Here, demolition orders cancelled, forever. Thanks. - Oome So what's your plan? For now l'm going back. Don't you think this town needs you? This town needed itself not me. And l needed for myself to come here for once. l had to do one thing, and l did that. By the way, it was good fighting with you. Me too. Don't you think there should be some more fight. What? You liked it, l liked it, there must be some good in it. l don't like to fight without a reason. No fight is without a reason. That's what you taught us.
