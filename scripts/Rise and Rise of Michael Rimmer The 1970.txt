(CLICKS INTERCOM SWITCH) Mr Ferret? (FERRET) (OVER INTERCOM) With cream, please. No, Mr Ferret. But I always have cream. And sugar. There's a Mr Buffery to see you. Oh. Send him up, please. Third floor, please. Yes? Yes. (# MAIN 'RIMMER' THEME) (KNOCKS ON DOOR) (DOOR OPENS) Mr Ferret? Oooh! (CHAIR SMASHES) Just popped in to cancel our contract. Good morning. You all right? Mr, er... - Rimmer, sir. 'Co-ordination'. - Ah, yes. Keep it up. Vital work. Thank you. 'Co-ordination'? I'll read those figures back again. That's, er... two pounds to win on 'Lively Lady' and, er... a fiver on 'The Groper'. - Ah. - It's Mr Federmann, isn't it? That's right. Yes. Thank you. (RIMMER) Mr Pumer? Yes. - Who are you? - Rimmer. 'Co-ordination'. - Ah. - Please carry on. Hello again, Mr Federmann. Ah, hello. (DOOR REFUSES TO LOCK) (TOILET FLUSHES AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS) Ah, well. Back to the grindstone. (RIMMER) It's, er Mr, er...? - Crodder. (RIMMER) ...Crodder. (EMPHATICALLY) Crodder! Is nothing sacred? (CRODDER) Extraordinary thing just happened in the toilet. I was just going in and there's a fellow there with a stop-watch. That's Mr Rimmer. 'Co-ordination'. Is he one of those ghastly time-and-motion people? I think he's working for Mr Fairburn himself. - Hello. - Oh, morning. - Can't hang about. Lots to do. - Of course. (TANYA) Mr Fromage and Mr Waring, Mr Ferret. Ah. (FERRET) Good morning... Well, you've come about the advertising, I suppose? Just over six months ago you undertook our new advertising campaign. We heard from you for the first time yesterday. You sent us some slogans for advertising our dog food. Good. We don't make dog food, Mr Ferret. (EMPHATICALLY) We... make... humbugs. Oh. And you're not thinking of branching out into dog foods? No. (WITH MOUNTING ANGER) And if we were, we would want something more original than Woof makes doggies bounce with health! (RIMMER) We are working on a new presentation concept, Mr Waring. Mr Ferret will have it ready next week. One week it is. Make a note of that, Tanya. (# TANGO 'LA CUMPARSITA' FROM RECORD PLAYER) (STOP-WATCH CLICKS) (PUMER) Tango... - Ah, yes. My wife and I have been selected for the South-East. Congratulations! Thank you. I practise in the coffee-break. Of course. I don't have coffee... Good Lord! Well, coffee-break over. (MUSIC COMES TO AN END) (RIMMER) Thank you. - Fine. (FERRET) Thank you, Tanya. That will be all for now... I'm afraid. All right, Mr Ferret. (RIMMER) If it's alright by you, sir, I'll take over the office next door. Oh, good. Yes. Look, I tell you what  why don't you take it over? Thank you. Well, must be off. - Time waits for no man. - Yes. (TANYA YELPS IN SURPRISE) (FERRET) What have you done to my water, Tanya? (TANYA) The water board have cut it off, sir. (FERRET) Whatever did we do to them? (TANYA) We never paid them, sir. (FERRET) Money, money, money. Whatever's the world coming to? See you in the pub, later. (PUMER) 'Night, Mr Ferret. - Goodnight. (TANYA) 'Night, Mr Ferret. - Goodnight. (FERRET) They'll be cutting off the electricity next. (FERRET GASPS AS HE BANGS HIS NECK) (RIMMER) Hello. (FERRET) Oh, Mr Rimmer. I was just conducting a little experiment. On the effect on office efficiency of total darkness. (RIMMER) Oh, yes. I shouldn't bother to tell Mr Fairburn. He's a little out of touch with modern methods. (CAT YOWLS) (SLURRING WORDS) Good evening. - Where have you been? - I've been to lots of places... - Paris... Rome... - (IMPATIENTLY) Tonight? Ah. Tonight I've been working late. You come back here, reeking of sex and scent with a love-bite on your neck, and you say you were working late! It's not scent, my dear. Nor is it a love-bite. I've been washing my face in Coca-Cole... Cola. When all the lights went out and I banged my neck on a fire... extinguisher.

(FERRET) Good morning! (YVONNE) You're late, Mr Ferret... (FERRET) Terrible traffic. Terrible traffic yesterday. Just like last week. (CRODDER) Can't stop. It's all go this morning. - Terrible traffic. (CRODDER) Mr Rimmer's anxious to see you. - Ah, good. (RIMMER) Mr Ferret! - Yes, ah... Ha-ha. Didn't see you! Sorry about the hole in the wall. Terrible traffic today. Have you got the results of the Wheety-Flakes survey? Er... not as such. But I've got the one on boot polish. (RIMMER) And what does it show? Well, it shows, er... ...it shows that ninety percent of British families don't like boot polish for breakfast. Been some sort of a mix-up here with the questionnaires. I'll go into it right away. I'd rather you didn't. Right. I'll... ...I'll not go into it. (# PASTORAL FLUTE AND STRING MUSIC) (BIRDS SINGING) (RIMMER) I've got it all here, Mr Fairburn. What? Who are you? Rimmer, sir. It's the Business Efficiency report you commissioned. Did no such thing! Never seen you before in my life. (RIMMER) I must say your decision to investigate was very timely. Well, that's what decisions should be. Must have slipped my mind. (FAIRBURN) I'm afraid my wife's been a bit under the weather. (RIMMER) Nothing serious, I hope? No, no. She'll linger on for quite a while yet. I've got the report here if you'd like to see it, sir. (FAIRBURN) It's a bit large... Couldn't you give me a run-down? I'm rather busy today. (RIMMER) Well, basically your firm is running an annual deficit of seventy-five thousand pounds. Seventy-five thousand pounds! My God! Do you know the words that come to my mind? No, sir. I don't know the words. (FAIRBURN, SHOUTING) Fire Ferret! Those are the words. Fire Ferret! (TV COMMENTATOR) England now really in a commanding position... ...and the wicket is still playing absolutely perfectly... (BUZZ OF INTERFERENCE) ...my goodness me, what a glorious exhibition... (FAIRBURN, DISTANTLY) Fire Ferret! Those are the words. Of course I know my way! Think I've never been here before? ...beautifully timed leg sweep, gone for four runs... Let's get rid of him. Fire Ferret! Ah, Mr Fairbum. - Fairburn! - Fairburn, yes. ...and another leg sweep, and again it's gone for four runs... We're doing, er, market research on people watching television on the cricket... (FERRET) Yes. Do sit down, Mr Creambun... er, Fairburn. Throw those files somewhere. Anywhere. (FORCED NERVOUS LAUGHTER) What are you laughing at, Ferret? Nothing really. Just trying to break the ice. (EMPHATICALLY) You're fired! Well. Better be off, then. One moment, Ferret! Seventy-five thousand pounds, sir. Seventy-five thousand pounds... Seventy-five thousand pounds! (FERRET) That is a lot. You owe me a lot of money, Ferret, and you will remain with this firm, working very hard in a menial capacity, for a pittance until such time as I've decided that you have worked off your debt! Otherwise, it is P... R... I... S... O... N! P... R... I...? Prison? Good thinking. I'm sorry about all that unpleasantness. Why don't you take the afternoon off? (RIMMER, INTO DICTAPHONE) Oh, and you'd better send off some money to Oxfam, as well. (TANYA) Mr Fromage and Mr Waring to see you, Mr Rimmer. Good morning, Mr Fromage. Good morning, Mr Waring. (BOTH) Good morning. (RIMMER) Very nice to see you again. Please sit down. (RIMMER) Well, our new survey shows the reasons for the declining sales of The Olde English Humbug. You can be quite frank with us, Mr Rimmer. What does it say? Basically, the consumer strongly dislikes the taste of your product. Furthermore, its extreme hardness makes it almost impossible to eat. - Very true. - Nobody knows this better than us, Mr Rimmer. I don't think there's any cause for worry, though. With the right sort of campaign we can make a virtue out of these defects. (# STYLISH 'JET-SET' MUSIC) (SMOOTH MASCULINE VOICEOVER) What's keeping him? Why doesn't he come? Suddenly she remembers her tube of Scorpios. (# FEMALE CHORUS  Scorpio... Scorpio...) (# Scorpio... Scorpio...) The refreshing hardness tingles on her tongue. (# Scorpio... Scorpio...) She doesn't need him any more. Enjoy yourself with a Scorpio. (# Scorpio!) Good God! Is that our old humbug? (FERRET) Here's the coffee you asked for, sir. (RIMMER) It was tea, Ferret. Ah. Tea, was it? Well, I think there may be some tea in it. (TANYA) Good morning, Mr Rimmer. (RIMMER) Morning, Tanya. - Morning. - Morning, Mr Rimmer. (PUMER) What are your plans for this week, sir? (RIMMER) Please call me Michael. - Oh. Thank you, Michael. This week, I thought we'd concentrate on sex. - Oh. Good idea. - Yes! I'd like to suggest an all-embracing probe into British sexual habits. Isn't that rather close to the wind? (RIMMER) Well, I don't know about your personal sexual habits, Mr Crodder but there is wide public interest in the subject. (CRODDER) My sexual habits? - I don't want anyone enquiring in... (RIMMER) In yours, and everybody else's. I think an honest and extremely detailed investigation of this kind is the quickest way of getting us onto the front pages. Hear, hear! (CRODDER) Excuse me. We're conducting a poll into the sexual habits of the British. Oooh! Come on in... (BUBBLING) (PUMER) Hello. I wonder if you could help me? We're doing this sex survey... (FACTORY HOOTER OBSCURES EMPHATIC REPLY) How many times a week? You're joking! The last time was Tuesday... June the 3rd, 1953. It was the Coronation that got her going. Oh, it's quite enjoyable work. But it's not really my profession, you know. No, I regard it more as a sort of stepping-stone to show business. (MUFFLED GROAN FROM CLOSET) Oh, Mr Mandeville. I'd forgotten all about you! (FRUITILY) It's a pleasure! (CRODDER) Five times an hour! (FEDERMANN) Why are they always in Latin? (PUMER) I thought this one was a cough linctus. (RIMMER) Keep it up. (MRS FERRET) If you spent a little less time reading about sex and a little more time doing something about it! I do. Err, err, I mean I don't. I'm reading about the Pound. On the floor again. - Well, I must be off to work. - Have you been fired? Fired? (LAUGHS) Oh, dear. Fired! (LAUGHTER DIES AWAY) Then why is the car for sale? (FERRET) Oh, that? No, that's a mistake. That's one of Rimmer's cock-ups. That should read FORS ALE. It's a new beer we're advertising. 'Fors Ale...' 'Keeps you hearty and hale.' - I've never heard of it. - No, you may never. Very hush-hush. (MAN ON MONITOR) And then the moon climbs, a great copper ball, until she tops the long, dark line of the elms, and laces the countryside silver for then you'll hear a nightingale sing  (IMITATES NIGHTINGALE) (APPLAUSE) (HENCH) Thank you very much, Percy. Do grocers indulge in sexual intercourse twice as often as butchers? Is Doncaster the wife-swapping capital of Great Britain? Do money and sexual inventiveness go hand-in-hand? A sensational poll published this morning purports to give the answers. I have with me Michael Rimmer, of Fairburn Polls and Peter Niss, of the rival International Opinion Polls. - Mr Rimmer, I have the feeling... - Congratulations! (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) I get the impression that you conducted this survey because you felt that this kind of scientifically-disguised smut would give your firm maximum publicity. Could you tell me why you asked me on the programme? To find out your real motives in publishing the poll. And to talk about sex. Do let's try not to be frivolous. Well, sex may be frivolous to you, Mr Niss, but it's not to me, and the vast majority of the people in this country. Yes, but do we really want to know how many times a week and how satisfactory the results? - Yes, I do. - Oh. I think everybody's interested. Well, it's not the sort of poll we could conduct at IOP. Well, I think that's a pity because I think the more we know what people really want and feel, the better. I think polls are just beginning. In fact, it's the only way we can adapt our society to fit its real needs. Well, now let's see how our cross-section of society feels about your particular sex poll. You, sir  What do you think about publicising people's personal sexual habits? I think you seem to disapprove... I wonder if your wife agrees? I'm not his wife. Go away, please. Anybody else here from Doncaster? (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) (NISS, LAUGHING) and you knew they weren't married, all the time? (HENCH) Yes. Poor sods. (NISS) What you might call a moment of real television. (LAUGHS) (HENCH) Well, I'd better go and look after Percy. He gets a bit broody. (RIMMER) Peter, I was just jotting down a few reasons why you might like to leave IOP and come over to us at the Fairburn Organisation. (NISS) Ah, yes. Yes, I see  that's very well put. Yes, I particularly like the noughts. (RIMMER) Thanks to you, Peter, IOP have built up a fantastic reputation for accuracy. (NISS) How very kind. Scotch, please. (RIMMER) I suppose if their next poll turned out to be wildly inaccurate it might divert a little custom our way? (NISS) Yes. (RIMMER) What was the normal sample you took there? (NISS) We usually asked about a thousand. That's all one normally needs. (RIMMER) Only a thousand? - Yes. (RIMMER) So if we knew which particular thousand were going to be asked next time... Well, of course, it would be very unethical of me to reveal my knowledge of IOP's next poll. Yes. Yes, I think unethical is the word. - Practically criminal... - Cheers! Inside your folders, along with your twenty-five pound bonus, you'll find detailed instructions and photographs of twenty men. These twenty men are undertaking a survey on religious attitudes for International Opinion Polls. Tomorrow Wednesday  they will be in Nuneaton. So will you. Lights please! Those of you in Group One will go immediately to the Rawleigh Shopping Precinct where you'll see this man. (RIMMER) (SHOUTING) Ferret! (FERRET) Sorry! (CRODDER MOANS) What's the matter with Crodder? Well, I'm afraid the sex survey's rather taken it out of him, sir. Where you'll see this man. (RIMMER) When he questions you, you will give the answers provided on your sheet. (PUMER) Come on. Quickly. Come on. Come on. Twenty-five past. We want to be going by half-past. Come on. Okay, now you all know your groups, right? Now, Groups Two and Three, go to your stations  you'll find them up that way. Groups Four and Five, your stations you'll find up that way. Right, now Group One, the rest of you, follow me. Walk naturally. (PUMER) Morning. (INTERVIEWER) Morning. (PUMER) I was just, er, cleaning my pockets out over in that, er... thing. Oooh! Ah, ah... - Banged my leg on this bench... (INTERVIEWER) Oh. Oof, er... Yes, I, er... banged my leg against this... this old bench. Erm... are you all right? (PUMER) Yes, fine. Fine, thanks. Yes, I like to keep fit, plenty of exercise. Yes, you could almost say it was my, er, religion. Erm, I'm awfully sorry. What I really wanted to ask you was, could you possibly tell me the time, please? Oh, sorry. Yes, er, yes... It's just before nine-fifteen. Ah, thank you very much indeed  because I was saying to my wife when we were praying this morning... (INTERVIEWER) Excuse me. We're doing a survey of people's religious attitudes and habits ...er, excuse me, madam... we're just doing a survey of people's religious attitudes and habits and would very much value your opinion. Oh, yes. Certainly. (INTERVIEWER) What religion are you? - I'm a Buddhist. - A Buddhist? - Yes. - I see. A practising Buddhist? - Yes. How long have you been a Buddhist? All my life. (INTERVIEWER) Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, erm... - We're doing a survey of religious... (CRODDER) I'm a Buddhist. You're a Buddhist? There's a lot of us in Nuneaton, you know. (INTERVIEWER) Er, well... (PUMER) I'm awfully sorry to bother you once again. Could you possibly tell me what time...? (INTERVIEWER) Yes, yes, sorry. Yes, sorry  It's just past nine-sixteen, so you're all right there. (PUMER) Oh, yes. As I was saying to my religious father... (INTERVIEWER) Excuse me... excuse me, madam. Erm, excuse me, madam. What... what religion are you? What... (TANYA) I'm Church of England. Have you always been C of E? Oh, no. Only since I married. And before that you were...? (BOTH) A Buddhist. (PUMER) I'm frightfully sorry... Look, would you please stop asking me the time! Now, stop it! (PUMER) I'm a Buddhist... There has been strong reaction in Nuneaton to the poll published today by IOP showing that forty-two percent of the population of Nuneaton are practising Buddhists, twenty-two percent are Mohammedans, only eleven percent are Church of England, and that nine percent are worshippers of the Great White Ram. From Nuneaton now, Gerald Pringle reports. This astonishing result has raised strong feelings among the God-fearing people of Nuneaton. The man in the street is shocked and bewildered. (IN BIRMINGHAM ACCENT) I'm shocked and bewildered, Gerald. I'm, er, bewildered and shocked! Was that alright? I'm not saying that Buddhism is a bad thing. But is it a good thing? It's possible to approach God in a great many different ways  but there's no need to be silly about it. From the angry streets of Nuneaton... goodnight. The Leader of the Opposition, Tom Hutchison in a speech at Beccles, soundly condemned the Government over this incident. In our manifesto at the last election we pointed out, in no uncertain terms, the danger of opinion poll firms operating without proper control. If I may quote  There are many other fields in which the Tory Party might not hesitate to take action. (APPLAUSE) (CLAPPER-LOADER) 'Scene One, Take Eight.' (HENCH) Mr Rimmer, doesn't this result clearly demonstrate that we place rather too much trust in opinion polls? (RIMMER) Not at all. Although I do think it raises some doubts about the sampling methods of IOP. But why should we believe that your methods are any more reliable? I just want to be judged by results, Steven. Take the forthcoming by-election at Lymholt. I'm prepared to guarantee that our forecast - will be within one percent. (DIRECTOR) Cut! Thank you very much. Bloody idiot! How the hell can you guarantee one percent? We'll ask everybody. (# MARCHING MUSIC) - Oh. Mrs Spimm... - Hello again! We're conducting a survey into people's voting habits. Come on in... (PRINGLE) And now here is the Returning Officer, Alderman Poot to announce the results. The Fairburn opinion poll has predicted a Conservative victory by 4.1 percent. (RETURNING OFFICER, VIA PA) Edith Melon. (PRINGLE) Liberal. (RETURNING OFFICER) Three thousand, two hundred and twelve. (RETURNING OFFICER) Kevin Parrot. (PRINGLE) Labour. (BOOS AND CHEERS) (RETURNING OFFICER) Twelve thousand, seven hundred and ninety-one. (PRINGLE) That's down, and it is possibly a low poll. (RETURNING OFFICER) Colonel Richard Pryor-Grafton. (PRINGLE) Conservative. (RETURNING OFFICER) Fourteen thousand and eight. (PRINGLE) Oh, Conservatives in by 4.1 percent. Tremendous triumph for Fairburn Polls and, of course, the Conservatives. (HUTCHISON) Hello, Geoffrey! (GEOFFREY) Morning, Tom. (HUTCHISON) I must say I like the, er... (GEOFFREY) Ah, yes. Well, if the people won't come to the church the church must come to the people. I like the steeple particularly, don't you? The feeling that, er... (RIMMER) Julian! Lovely exhibition. Thought it was absolutely super... ...marvellous. See you later. - Lady Dorothy, how very sweet of you to come. (LADY DOROTHY) I wouldn't have missed it... (RIMMER) Hugh! I loved your speech on abortion. - It was really gorgeous. (WILTING) Thank you... (RIMMER) How very good of you to come, sir. (HUTCHISON) Hello, Michael. (RIMMER) Nice to see you. Like some champagne? (HUTCHISON) Thank you. (RIMMER) Lots of food all around. You can just pick it up as you want. (GEOFFREY) Thank you very much. (HUTCHISON) My goodness. You seem to have half of London here. (RIMMER) Just a few friends, really. (GEOFFREY) I think parties are such a good idea. (RIMMER) Do you like them? Nice place, too. Have you managed to find time for our little survey? Yes. I think we've managed to put our finger on the reason for your declining attendances. We've tried everything, you know. Pop groups. Bingo. Hallucinogens in the wafers. Son et Lumiere in the graveyard, and, of course, these clothes are a bit out for the 1970s. I think that's very good thinking, but there is one basic stumbling block. What's that? What's keeping them away? God. I had a nasty suspicion it was that. You see, seventy-three percent of the population find it very difficult to believe in Him. Well, I do think that doubt is a terribly important part of belief. You mean if we were to fade out the God-side of the worship, we'd get better attendances? (RIMMER) I think it's worth trying in any case. (GEOFFREY) Yes. A sort of Our Father, which might be in Heaven? (RIMMER) Yes, that kind of thing. Good. (FAIRBURN) Delicious kedgeree! (RIMMER) Hello, sir. Nice to see you. (PHOTOGRAPHER) Mr Rimmer, sir! (RIMMER) Thank you. (FAIRBURN) Ferret... (SHUTTER CLICKS) (FAIRBURN) ...I'd like that mackerel! Peter, how very super of you to come. Anything for a laugh. - Have you got that dossier? - Yes. Better go have a word with Tom Hutchison... (FAIRBURN) No, not that one, Ferret... That one! Just shout for champagne if you need any... Oh, excuse me. Looks great... Everything all right? Sorry to neglect you, sir. (HUTCHISON) Not at all. Excuse me... I must say I was most impressed with the Lymholt prediction. Thank you very much. I believe you're conducting a survey as to the relative merits of the Prime Minister and myself. (RIMMER) Yes. Very interesting results. Vapid. Oh dear. Cold... tedious... uninspiring. It's not so good over the page. It's all very well being warm and lovable but what this country needs is some tough thinking at the top! I couldn't agree more, sir. (TANYA) Excuse me, sir. The Prime Minister's on the phone. Tell him I'll call him back, would you? You know, Rimmer. This survey of yours isn't going to make it any easier for me at the party conference. There have been some rumblings, you know. I suppose if we only publish the more... positive aspects of your leadership, it might, er... (HUTCHISON) Ah, yes, well, hmm... Have you ever thought of going into politics, Michael? We need some dynamic young blood in the party. (RIMMER) But are there any seats available? (HUTCHISON) Oh, yes. There are always seats available to the right man. Old Eric Bentley's thinking of retiring. (RIMMER) Well, I would be very interested. (HUTCHISON) Of course, it depends on what happens at the conference. (RIMMER) I think I can help you there, Tom. - Really? (FAIRBURN) (LOUDLY) No, no, Ferret! That one! (HUTCHISON) (DECLAIMING) And the first priority must be that of trades union reform... (RIMMER) (HECKLING) What about unemployment? (HUTCHISON) Don't talk to me about unemployment! (RIMMER) Very good. Keep the turn, that was beautiful. Now if we could just try it once again. (HUTCHISON) Don't talk to me about unemployment, young man. I was... unemployed before you were born. My memory of those terrible days in the Thirties still brings tears to my eyes. (NISS) Now. Cry now. (RIMMER) Don't worry, Tom. We'll supply your tears. (HUTCHISON) Oh, thank you! (RIMMER) Right next heckle. (HE SINGS 'THE RED FLAG') The people's flag is deepest red... (NISS) It shrouded oft our martyred dead... (HUTCHISON) Thank you for your charming rendition but I do not think the group is ready to record yet. (RIMMER AND NISS APPLAUD) Lose the smile, love. (RIMMER) Right, applause, applause. (FOOTBALL RATTLES TURN RIMMER AND NISS CHEER) - Hurray! - Bravo! - Wonderful! - Well done, Tom! (RIMMER) Well done, Tom! (NISS) What a ham.

(HUTCHISON) And now, if I may turn to economic matters... (WOMAN IN AUDIENCE) What about the Old Age Pension? (RIMMER) That's not in the script... (WOMAN) What about the Old Age Pension? (HUTCHISON) Don't talk to me about unemployment, young man! I was unemployed before you were born. My memory of those terrible days in the Thirties still brings tears to my eyes. And I, and the whole of the Conservative Party are strongly committed... (CAPSULE HISSES) and I emphasise this... (BANGS ON LECTERN) We are committed to a policy of full employment...

(ENTHUSIASTIC APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) Amidst amazing scenes at the Conservative Party conference this afternoon the Leader of the Opposition was accorded an unprecedented seven minutes ovation. Mr Hutchison. Your position as leader must now be completely secure. How do you feel about the violent heckling that punctuated your speech? I am not saying that the Labour Party was responsible for this disgraceful episode. But I will say this  it did seem to be organised. (PHOTOGRAPHERS) One more, sir! - Look this way, sir! (HUTCHISON) Michael! Niss! (RIMMER) Well done, Tom! Very good indeed. (HUTCHISON) What's the next move then, Michael? (RIMMER) At the moment, Tom, I've got my personal life to consider. - I'm thinking of getting married. - Oh, congratulations, Michael. - I think an MP needs a wife by his side. - Quite right. (NISS) Who is it? That... I'm not entirely sure of. Have you got the result of that poll yet? Yes. Queen, number one, as usual. She's out. Oh, yes. Number two.

Nice of you to come. My privilege, Prime Minister. - Make yourself comfortable. - Thank you. Tell me, Michael. Have you ever thought about going into politics?

We're not bound by dogma. Think it over. The offer's there. Thank you. Now then, my spies tell me  not literally, of course!

But your polls have always shown me as being more popular than the government as a whole. Exactly. The public haven't been seeing enough of you. I mean, you haven't been on our TV screens for quite a while now. Well, I try to give the impression that we work as a team. But every team needs a leader. True. So you think a little more exposure on the silvery tube? The more the better! (BLACKET LAUGHS QUIETLY) (PRIME MINISTER, ON RADIO) Good evening, and hello again. A lot has happened since ten o'clock this morning, so I thought it was about time we had another of our little fireside chats... (RIMMER) Never seen a man dig his own grave before. (PAT) Go turn him off, Michael. (CHANNEL CHANGES TO 'LOUNGE' MUSIC STATION) (RIMMER) I must tell you how much I've always admired your seat. It's been an inspiration to me over the years. (HE KISSES PAT) (RIMMER) With this ring... Stop it. We mustn't... Once doesn't count as breaking training. I've got the Olympic Heats tomorrow... ...I've got the 'olympic heats' tonight. (DREAMILY) I think I've achieved a new personal best! (TV COMMENTATOR) The surprise upset at the White City was the defeat of Pat Cartwright who failed to complete her round. (SOUND OF SPLASH AT WATER JUMP) She complained afterwards of stomach cramps. (INTERFERENCE) ...We see her now coming out on Brown Goblin. She's safely over the first  riding slightly higher in the saddle than usual  a quick turn here... (FERRET SWITCHES SET OFF) (MRS FERRET) Where's it all gone? (FERRET) Huh? Where's all what gone? - The furniture. - Ah. Well, while you were out this morning it started getting a bit shaky. So I just popped it into the furniture shop to have it re-pawned... repaired. I rather like it like this. A great feeling of space. Care for a glass of 'Fors'? (BLACKET) Good morning! (GUARD) Nice to see you again so soon, sir. - You know the way, I imagine? - Oh, yes. We thought of building you a flat up there, sir. Oh, no, no. Very amusing! Because I'm here so often, you mean? (LAUGHS) Bloody Capricorns! I'll have a word with Bob about him. A little regional unemployment, I think. (LAUGHS LOUDLY) (# PASTORAL FLUTE AND HARPSICHORD MUSIC) (HUTCHISON) Oh, Michael. Let me introduce my old friend Teddy Mandeville. The next Chancellor of the Exchequer, eh, Teddy? (RIMMER) Very nice to meet you in the flesh, sir. (MANDEVILLE) It's a pleasure. (SPOT) Hello. (HUTCHISON) I must say that Blacket idea's working out awfully well. (SPOT) Even our gardener's sick of him. I mean, he's never off the box! (RIMMER) I hope he doesn't die of over-exposure. (LAUGHTER) Such a ghastly little man! (RIMMER) He is a big help. You know what's going to decide the election? Law and order. That, and the race issue. I think we should be tougher with the immigrants. Well, I don't see how we can be any tougher than the Labour Party. We can't let in less than zero. (SPOT) We could let a few out. I mean, Uncle Eric's got this super idea about a boat race. Five thousand pounds for the first West Indian who can row back to Jamaica. When they all sort of row off, it'll be fantastic! - I mean... (SPOT'S AUNT) Spot. Your shot. Oh, my shot... Coming, Auntie Vanya! (RIMMER) As Sir Eric is retiring in any case why don't you allow him to express his real views? (HUTCHISON) The man's a lunatic! Good shot, Eric! (RIMMER) Exactly. He could make a grossly inflammatory speech  you could sack him and emerge as a man of principle, yet the impression would still get about that we are tougher on immigration than the Socialists. (RIMMER) Peter, I wonder if I could tear you away from my fiance for a moment? Like you to call up a few newspapers... Nobody could accuse me of being a racialist... (SPOT LAUGHS) ...but when I hear stories as well-authenticated as this which I heard from a very close friend of a constituent who had been talking to somebody in a pub who had heard from an extremely reliable source that a fragile old lady of ninety-two had been locked in a lavatory by a group of ten immigrants who proceeded to poke at her with sharpened broomsticks for a period of fourteen hours whilst they chanted anti-white slogans, and finally forced her to use a newspaper photograph of Mr Enoch Powell in a way... that I'd rather not go into here. When I hear stories like that, I wonder  are we mad, to allow, in this country, fragile old ladies to be ruthlessly poked by blacks! (SCATTERED APPLAUSE) (PHOTOGRAPHER) Could we take it from the end again, please? (BENTLEY) Eh? (PHOTOGRAPHER) 'Are we mad...' (BENTLEY, REPEATING) Are we mad? Are we mad? Are we mad?

Are we mad? Are we? Have you read this filth? (INDIFFERENTLY) Yes, I have. Dreadful, quite dreadful. Dearie me. Oh, dear. What are you going to do? I can't be Home Secretary in a party that condones racialism. Don't you worry, Hugh. I will act  I will act. In fact, on matters of principle I am acting the whole time. Sir Eric is announcing his resignation this evening. Yes, Michael's taking his seat at the General Election. But that still gives the impression we're a lot of racialists! I admire your integrity, Hugh but you must realise we must win this election. (# HUTCHISON BEGINS TO PLAY LIGHT PIANO PIECE) And let's face it this won't do us any harm at all. No harm. At all. It's no good. I must speak out! You see, Hugh I don't think Tom wants another five years in opposition. I don't care. I won't be muzzled! (PIANO CONTINUES) Hello, whitey! Good evening. You're trash, man. (BLOW LANDS) - I'm on your side! - I've got rhythm... I understand your motives. Now let's discuss this rationally. Violence breeds... violence! (WILTING) Cool it, baby!

Just, erm, a few drops in the eyes to get the merry twinkle going! (LAUGHS) And, er, could you make the mouth more generous? (NISS) Keeping fit? (PAT) That's about all there is for me to do around here. (NISS) Yes, I used to be pretty fit when I was in the army. The only trouble was, it made me so incredibly ...randy. (PAT) Yes. It does. Incredibly randy. Yes, you must be... pretty fit. How's married life suiting you? How should I know? I've hardly seen him since the ceremony. What about all those lovely pictures of you together in the papers? That's about the only time we've been together  when there's a photographer around. (NISS) Yes. Yes, I must admit there is a calculating side to Michael that I find very... disturbing. But do you actually know anything about him? I mean, where does he come from? Never talks to me about it. Just tells me that he was found in the bulrushes. (PAT) You can't stand him, can you? No. Er, no, no, no nothing like that. I just don't like to see what he's doing to you. What he's not doing to me... (COUNTRY SOUNDS) Good evening! Before you vote next week I'd like you to remember that basically, you know, friends, this election isn't about money and material things  it's about morality. The Labour Party's nothing if it is not a moral crusade. It's hardly necessary for me to remind you what we stand for. The Labour Party stands for... (AUTOCUE CLICKS INEFFECTUALLY) well, er, it stands for, er... (AUTOCUE IS SWITCHED OFF AND ON) well, it stands for... we stand for, er... (SHOUTS) Look! I'm not standing for any more of this! Look, stop the cameras, get the bloody man off the autocue! (FLOOR MANAGER) It's live, sir! (BLACKET, SHOUTING LOUDER) Pull your fingers out! (FLOOR MANAGER) It's a live broadcast, sir. They can see you... (BLACKET) What? Oh, oh... (FORCED LAUGHTER) (SHOUTS, PANICKING) Oh, oh... dung! (LOUD CRASH OF EQUIPMENT) (SHOUTS) I'll sack the lot of you! Stop it! Stop the bloody thing! Stop the machine! Is there nobody in control here? (HUTCHISON) I must say, Michael, you did an excellent job with Blacket. I hope I can continue to do well, sir. (HUTCHISON) I've been thinking about the composition of the Government... (HE GASPS AT THE COLDNESS OF THE WATER) and I was trying to work out where your many talents would bear most fruit. Well, as all my experience has been in financial matters I thought Chancellor of the Exchequer. (HUTCHISON) Oh, my dear Michael. You're not even an MP yet! (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I must say I admire your directness and drive... ...but you must see that Mandeville must be in charge of the Exchequer. Of course, I've always believed that a man's personal life is his own affair. What do you mean? You haven't heard anything, then? No. What is there to hear? Well, I hate to spread gossip, and they're probably faked, in any case. What are faked? The photographs I was sent. Of Mandeville? ...And friends. But even if they're real, I don't see why they should affect his efficiency at the Exchequer. Do you have these, erm, photographs with you? Yes, I thought it better to hand them over to you and say no more about it. God knows where the negatives are. That's not Mandeville. The other way up, sir. Good God! The continental pig! Good heavens! Tut, tut! Keister! God... I may have to reconsider. (NEWSPAPER SELLER SHOUTS RAUCOUSLY) Conservative Shadow Chancellor resigns without giving his reason. Surprise appointment of Tory whizzkid, Michael Rimmer! The next Conservative Government will reduce Income Tax, reduce Purchase Tax and increase Old Age Pensions. This I solemnly pledge. And now, to help you make up your minds, here is a chance to take another look at the alternative to a Conservative Government... (SHOUTS, PANICKING) Oh, dung!

What can I do with my... with my 'X'? Oh, yes. I can... I can make 'SEX' with the S of 'BEDS'. And I can add U... A... L... Five more to me. Yes, but you don't know what you've let yourself in for  you see, I can use your 'LOYALTY' to make... 'SEXUALITY'. (HE LAUGHS) Well, all I can do is this  N... O... 'NO'? But you can't do that. I mean, it isn't connected to anything. Oh yes it is. Goodnight, Peter. (# CURRENT AFFAIRS THEME) Good evening and welcome to Election Grandstand. The first result should be coming in quite soon from Clitheroe. This is Hugh Wilting's seat and traditionally the first constituency to complete the counting. But first, with no results in, let's ask Peter Niss of Fairburn Polls, what he thinks of the situation. Well frankly, Steven, I think we've started the programme about an hour too early... (HENCH LAUGHS) Well, let's go over to Freddie Daring at Clitheroe, to see if there's any news yet. Well, these lads have a great reputation to maintain and they're absolutely determined to give us the first result! I've never seen such fast, hard counting, and I think we should have something to tell you in a few minutes. Well, thank you Freddie. And now let's take one more look at the state of the parties. Well, that's the position at the moment with no results in yet, and now perhaps we can get a reaction from New York. So over there now, by Early Bird, to Tom Stoddart. I am not your buddy. Neither am I your mother! Appalling people! Ah, yes, well  over here in New York we are all, as they say over here, 'dog-gone keen' to hear the first result... (HENCH) ...And so are we here in London. And we must go back up to Clitheroe as I think they may have something for us. Come in, Freddie. (HENCH) Freddie? Can you hear me? In that case, back to New York! Here in Stockholm, we are extremely excited... (HENCH) We don't want to talk to you at the moment, Doctor Luns  if we could talk to you later. We're going back to Clitheroe to get the first result. - Oh, but I want... (HENCH) Thank you, Doctor Luns, we'll come back to you in a moment. So over to Freddie Daring in Clitheroe for the first result! (HENCH) Hello, Freddie? - Hello, Freddie? (TOM STODDART) Over here in New York... (HENCH) Hello, Freddie? If we could just get Freddie... No, we don't have the result yet, but in the closing minutes these lads are going really berserk. George Winthrop, one of the most experienced counters, broke a finger just now  but he's carrying on. (DR LUNS) Hello, London! (HENCH) Well, thank you, Freddie. Well, still no results from Clitheroe. Peter Niss? In that case, let's rejoin our good friend Doctor Luns in Stockholm. Are you there, Doctor Luns? He has gone to the... He will be back. In that case, let's go over to Paris where Pierre Dubois is waiting. Bonsoir, Pierre! (WAITER) Bonsoir! (HENCH) Pierre Dubois, both candidates at Clitheroe are keen supporters of the Common Market. What's the French reaction to this phenomenon? Ecoutez, Monsieur. Je ne comprends rien et je m'en fou! Salut! Le service non compris. Comme d'habitude d'ailleurs! ...Well, I don't think we've located the right Pierre Dubois. But while we were talking to Paris we did get the first result not from Clitheroe but from Beccles and here it is. A Conservative gain of 17,000. Now let's see what swing that is. Over to Magnus Orbison on the swingometer. (HENCH) Peter Niss... Well, that's just under a twenty percent swing to the Conservatives. It's exactly what we predicted at Fairburn. If it's repeated it'll give the Conservatives an overall majority of, what, 265? Ah. Well now the results are coming in thick and fast. And here's an interesting result. Michael Rimmer has held Budleigh Moor for the Conservatives with a greatly increased majority. (# MAIN 'RIMMER' THEME) (MRS FERRET) He's in. I knew he'd do it! (FERRET) But only by 17,000. (HENCH) That's another Conservative gain. And so, with 435 results in, we have the news that the Prime Minister has conceded defeat. (TV EXPLODES) And now it's six-fifteen in the morning, there's only the Clitheroe result to come in. And here it is. After three recounts Hugh Wilting has retained his seat with a majority of only five. That's over 18,000 down from the last election, due no doubt to his courageous stand on the race issue. So now we leave Election Grandstand with a new Conservative Government in office. And it's thanks to all our experts, and good night. (FLOOR MANAGER) Right, that's it, studio. Wrap it up. (# CURRENT AFFAIRS THEME) (MUSIC ENDS) (ON MONITOR) Luns, here. Doctor Luns. Er, hello. Hello, London... This is Stockholm... (NEWSREADER) The Prime Minister is holding an emergency Cabinet meeting at Chequers to discuss what he describes as the very grave financial situation... (GENIAL CONVERSATION AND LAUGHTER) Gentlemen. The Chancellor is bringing the exact figures but I do feel that unless we announce strong measures there is a grave danger of another run on the Pound. I wonder if you would excuse me a moment? I have a rather important call to make to my wife in Zurich... Gentlemen. I must ask you as patriots and ministers not to speculate against the Pound. (HUTCHISON) Michael. There you are! Sorry to keep you, Tom. I wanted to have all the figures. (HUTCHISON) Good. We've just been discussing the appalling mess we've been left by the Socialists. (HUTCHISON) We have inherited a mess, haven't we? - Oh yes, yes. Yes, we have. - Good, fine! In fact, overall, the financial situation could be described as disastrous. - Catastrophic! - 'Hopeless' is another good one. I think we're all agreed on the nature of the problem. Now, Michael. What are your proposals for dealing with this, er... crisis. Well, first of all I'd reduce Income Tax, reduce Purchase Tax, and increase the Old Age Pensions. You must be mad! Well, I think we ought to honour our pre-election pledges. (HUTCHISON) No, no, Michael. - Nobody expects that of us. - Hear, hear! No, the normal routine is to say that we are all staggered and horrified and then blame it all on the last lot! I mean, what are our gold reserves at the moment? - Two-and-a-half million. - God Almighty! No, seriously, Michael. What are your proposals? Well, I've been having a word with our friends in Paris and Bonn. I didn't know we had any friends in Paris and Bonn. And I think that while I'm sort of, sorting things out it would be best to sit back and do nothing for a couple of weeks. Good idea! Will all those in favour of sitting tight and doing nothing for two weeks, raise one arm? (LAUGHTER) (HUTCHISON) Carried unanimously! Thank you, gentlemen. That's all I want to say to you. - Goodbye, Prime Minister. - 'Bye, Michael. Oh, and I do think we should try and create the impression of some activity. What about a summit? That would pass the time. Very good indeed. And talk about things in terms of keeping our options open. (HUTCHISON) Right. (CHAIRMAN) Jolly good idea. Very good idea. No comment, gentlemen.

(SOLEMN TYMPANI NOTES) Tonight, the country lies stunned by the tragic news of the death of the Prime Minister. (BLACKET DISGUISES INVOLUNTARY LAUGHTER BY COUGHING) Messages of sympathy have been pouring in from all over the world. The Pope has condemned the senseless violence of our times. The President of the USA has spoken warmly of the man with whom he recently spent so much time. Here in the studio tonight we have three men who knew him well. First, the Home Secretary, Hugh Wilting, who was with him when he died. This is a black day... er, darkish sort of day for Britain. (HENCH) Your Grace... I think it ironic that a man who so loved the sea should be, so to speak, bitten by the mouth that drowned him. Was it St Paul, or Cole Porter who said we always hurt the one who loves us? But I'm sure this fine man has found solace in Heaven with Almighty God if there is such a person. Mr Blacket. You, at times, have been on rather acrimonious terms with the late Prime Minister. We've had our differences. On one occasion indeed, on several occasions  you described him as a 'two-faced, weasel-eyed git'. In the rough-and-tumble of parliamentary debate one often says things that are easily misinterpreted. But there was a great warmth between us. One hates to make, er, party points, but, erm... ...Suffer little ones and let the little ones suffer. He giveth and taketh away, and casts his bread upon the waters. Well, let's take one more look at the tragic accident, this time in slow motion. (FILM ON SCREEN HAS NO SOUND) (HENCH) Here, we see the Prime Minister moving to one side to give the photographers a better view of the gold. This is the crucial moment. The Prime Minister slips.

What does your husband work at? My husband, Dave? Oh, he's a failure. Fine. And as an ordinary housewife who would you choose to lead the Conservatives? (WITH ENTHUSIASM) Oh, Michael Rimmer, Dave! He's everything my husband isn't! Well, Constance, all I can say to that is... (VOICE OF SMALL CHILD) ...groovy, baby! (BUBBLING) He's ruthless, opportunistic, dishonest, shallow, evasive, and unprincipled. But I'm still not sure he'll make a good leader. I shouldn't wait up for me tonight, darling. I might be a bit late. - I want a divorce. - Divorce? Why? To put it in the only terms you'd understand... sexually speaking we're seventy percent below the national average. I shouldn't pay too much attention to one month's figures. Seasonal variations can be very misleading. I mean it, Michael. I want a divorce. That's normal. About forty-two percent of married women go through this phase during the first year of their marriage. How would it affect your chances of being Prime Minister if I went on television tonight and told everybody where the North Sea gold really came from? You wouldn't do that.

I've chosen him because, above all, Teddy is a deeply human man. And nobody knows better than me how very human he can be. As public opinion polls have become such a vital part of our democratic way of life the time has come to take them out of private hands where they can possibly be misused. I've therefore created a National Poll Board under the chairmanship of Mr Peter Niss. (APPLAUSE) Now, you know that I've never sought power and now that I have power I want to share it with you. For it is you, the people of Britain, that have made this country great. From now on, I want to consult you directly. On every major issue there will be a referendum in which you can vote, so at last we can enjoy a real democracy. Goodnight. (# FORCEFUL MARCHING MUSIC) Oh, look. There's more coming. Isn't it nice! Makes me feel so important. We are important, Loretta. A vital cog. Hats off to Rimmer. (READS) Should we keep a continuing military presence in Binwandi? (MR SPIMM) Mmm. (MANDEVILLE) The whole country's gone mad. (BREAM) The public doesn't know anything about government. What does he think he's doing? (MANDEVILLE) He's off his head! (BREAM) I suppose there's one advantage. He can hardly fail to stay in power. (MANDEVILLE) In power? What power? The public have got all the power. Everyone's gone mad. (WILTING) Are you going to resign? (MANDEVILLE) I'm not mad. They are. Well, that's done. Bedtime, I think. I, er... I think I was right to take a firm line on China. (MRS SPIMM) Oh, guess you had to. (BEEPER SOUNDS) (MRS SPIMM) Ooh, quick, it's the emergency tele-vote! (VOICE FROM TV) Hello again. The Government would like to know your feelings on water pollution. (RIMMER) What could be more boring than water pollution? (NISS) Regional Development? - That is a good one. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? Oh dear... The postmen are threatening to strike. Good! (DOGS BARK AND WHINE) How can I be expected to know about the agrarian reforms of Nang-I-Tuot? (MR SPIMM) Yes, I know his heart's in the right place and he's doing it for us. And let's be fair he never sought power. But this isn't democracy. He shouldn't try and get us involved. That's his job. He's the leader! I mean, that's what we're paying him for, isn't it? (PRINGLE) During today... (MR SPIMM JOINS CHANT) No more polls! ...the demonstrations against the new democracy have reached their peak. Pillar boxes have been blown up and a group of twenty Post Office workers have chained themselves to the railings outside Buckingham Palace. (NEWSREADER) Earlier today, National Poll Board chairman Peter Niss faced a furious crowd demanding an end to 'government by referendum'. (EXCITED COMMENTATOR) ...from The Grocer, and at the post it's... (VOICE FROM TV INTERRUPTS. A BEEPER SOUNDS) Hello again. Regional Development. If you turn to page 98 of your TV voting guide you will find full details of tele-vote number 218... (MACHINE SQUAWKS) (RIMMER) As your Prime Minister, I hope I've never been afraid to admit my own mistakes. In every way, the economy is booming but I must admit that our experiment in participatory democracy seems to have run into some difficulties. Perhaps I was too idealistic. It may well be, that in these modern times we need a more streamlined form of presidential government. You must let me know if you share these feelings. Next week, you'll have the chance to tell me in what could be, if it's your wish, the last referendum for some time. (DIRECTOR) Right, cut it. How's that for you? (RIMMER) Okay, Brian. That's the one. I've read this referendum. What you're suggesting is nothing more or less than dictatorship! Well you, like everybody else, Hugh, will have a chance to vote against it. It's perfectly democratic. But what you don't realise, is that ninety percent of the population are idiots! I always thought all men were equal. You won't get away with this, Rimmer! (BYSTANDERS CHEER AND APPLAUD) (# STIRRING BRITISH TRIUMPHAL MARCH) (WILTING) Venceremos! We shall overcome! Venceremos! We shall overcome! (MUSIC BUILDS) (WILTING) Excuse me, may I get by? Mind out! Move, man. This thing's hot! Venceremos! We shall overcome! (MUSIC ENDS) (FERRET SCREAMS AS HE FALLS) (CROWD GASPS) (LOUD EXPLOSION) (DYING AWAY TO COMPLETE SILENCE) (# MAIN THEME REPRISES)
