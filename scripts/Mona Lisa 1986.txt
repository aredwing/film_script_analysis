He told me he'd cut me up. Then he'd tell me I was wonderful. What, in the same breath? Yeah. That's what a good ponce does. He drives flashy cars and lives in a room with a paraffin heater. Had a friend then. He ran the two of us. She was younger than me. Beautiful. She had a habit, and that's why I stayed. One day, I couldn't take it any longer. Met a man with a gold ring who took me to Brighton. When I woke up, he was gone. I didn't mind. Saw the sea outside. Met another on the pier, and that paid the hotel bill. Stayed the whole summer. Even managed to save. I came back to London. Met the man with the gold ring again. Learned about the West End hotels then... and a different world. I took a taxi around that street to look for Cath. But she was gone. If you last a year and a half on that street, you're lucky. I was lucky. I got out. Cathy. Her name's Cathy. - Uh-huh. - She's a Londoner. She has a tattoo on her hand, there. I promised I'd look after her. Things can happen out there. Out where? On the streets, in the clubs. I can't go down, but you could. I'll pay you. - How? - Anyway I can. I want to find her. you know the way it is. Yeah. You're a good man, Mr. George. How can you tell? I can tell. Will you think about it? Yeah, I'll think about it. - Promise? - I promise.

I've grown up, Thomas. - Time to look like other people. - You'll never look like other people, George. Fuck. Is that true? - Well, she don't think so. - Aye? What's she up to? She's not up to anything. She's a friend of mine. She's gotta be up to something. What do you think this lot costs? Well, she's a woman of substance. She's a lady. I thought you said she was a tart. - Tall, thin, black tart. - Well, maybe, but she's still a fuckin' lady. Sorry about the language.
