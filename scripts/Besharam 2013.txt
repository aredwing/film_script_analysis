When you come back on the roof to take off your clothes.. ..give me a miss call. l'll come and take off mine as well. Shut up, shameless. You're a grownup now, don't you feel ashamed? Nonsense. No manners. l'll beat you. Let's go, T2. How much longer will you take? l can't find my socks. l can't wear shoes without my socks. Here. What's this? Padding. The girl's do it. Give's a good impression. You can keep making a good impression. l'll wear my shoes without socks. Return my Rs.100. How can you just find sister-in-law?. You don't know her name either. Beauty! That's her name. Beauty! And what's her surname? Parlour? Beauty! Keep at it. You'll definitely find her on Google. Mister. How much for JACKFRUlT? Rs. 200 a kilo. Fine, 150 for you. What the.. What happened, aunt? Rascal! You made her faint with your increased prices.. ..and tore my shirt. Sir.. - Take that. - What did l do? Hello. Aunt. Get up, aunt. We'll pay for the stuff. You fool, give me a hand. Come on. Come on. That's my home, son. Stop. Stop. Stop, son. This? - Yes. l can't open this door, son. ls it broken? Oh, God! My back's broken. - Slowly, aunt. Slowly. Come back soon. - Yeah, sit tight. l wish God had given me a son like you. Not possible at this age, aunt. But you can get a son-in-law. Do you have a daughter? Low-life. Come, son. Keep it on the table. Tara. Tara. - Coming, mom. My knees. You? - You! The one l searched for everywhere.. ..was actually at the back of my torn shirt. What are you doing here? - l'll tell you.

Where else do you want me to go? - Your mom tore my shirt.. Shut up! Why would my mom tear your clothes at this age? Quiet! Let me tell you. l went to the market. lt was really hot. l felt dizzy and was falling down. My hand got stuck in his shirt. And all the buttons of this poor boy's shirt broke. And he's such a decent guy, he brought me home. lnstead of showing some hospitality.. ..you're rebuking him. Right, aunt, this isn't correct. Shall l take off my shirt, or.. ..will you stitch it while l'm wearing it? You're so hairy! Keep your shirt here. l'll get it fixed in a day or two. How am l looking? What's wrong, aunt? Feeling dizzy again? lt reminded me of her papa. He looked handsome just like you in this shirt. Doesn't he look handsome anymore? He's dead. lt's one of his old shirts. Sorry, aunt. l didn't know. No need to show sympathy. Now get lost. You're so hot. You spit fire. Okay, bye. See you, aunt. - Bless you, son. Do come again. - l will.. Not... Not... Not... Can l say something, beauty? l really like hot dames? Will you go to the disco with me? Shameless. ''Bells...are ringing in my ears.'' ''lt was love at first sight.'' ''l couldn't believe my eyes.'' ''l was gripped by fever.'' ''My heart jumped out.'' ''First the girl...got angry.'' ''She asked what are you doing here?'' ''l said l'm so lucky.'' ''The one who brought me here is your mom.'' ''What the..'' ''We looked everywhere for her.'' ''While she was here all the time.'' ''Her words were like a cup of tea.'' ''Sweet and hot.'' ''Like onion fritters, seasoned with chilly.'' ''She stormed with anger and threatened me.'' ''But l didn't budge.'' ''l kissed her cheeks.'' ''And her heart melted.'' ''Don't lie. You kissed her?'' ''Of course l am. After all l'm the hero.''

''Bells...are ringing in my ears.'' ''lt was love at first sight.'' ''l couldn't believe my eyes.'' ''l was gripped by fever.'' ''My heart jumped out.'' ''The heart jumped.'' ''The heart jumped.'' ''The heart raced.'' ''The heart raced.'' ''My heart swayed.'' ''My heart jumped, swayed, it raced.'' Yes, sir. Don't sit like that. Sir's coming. Sir's coming, get up. Get up l said. lt's clean. - Shut up! Sir's here. Who are you? T2. Terminator 2! l see. So who's Terminator 1? - At your service, mister. The name's Babli. Babli! Oh yes! l've heard a lot about you. He's Mr. Bheem Singh Chandel. His business in Chandigarh is money laundering. He needs jacked cars. Will you do the job? Payment, no life-threat. Money in advance. Right, sir? Have some sweet. Suck on this. Yes. The deal's done. Just tell us the car model. When someone's clapping with two hands.. ..you should never put your face in between. lt can be disastrous. Sorry. What if l runaway with your money? We'll find you. Oh! ls that real? - What do you think? T2. Gun! Have you lost your mind? What are you doing? Fan-tastic! lt's real. l do my job with love, not violence. But you can keep this. l'll keep this. Remember one thing. Once l make a deal, l never take my money back. l don't return it either. This isn't a loan. lt's a deal. lt's a deal. lt's a deal. Come on, get to work. But gently. Now go on... All the best. - Thank you. T2. - Hmmm. Get rid of him. - Who? Where? Him. lt's just a dog. You were acting so tough in front of Chandel. Now you're scared of a dog. Every man's scared of someone. Get rid of him. Shoo. Bloody dog. You're such a coward. Sit down. Sit where? Yes. Give him a shave. What? But looks like he's already had a shave. Then do it again. Come on. That will be 200. l'll pay 500. But not here. - Then? She won't come on the balcony. She's gone to her office. How do you know?. Everyone knows about Tara Sharma, sir. There's just one beautiful girl in this neighbourhood. Talk with respect. She's your sister-in-law. - No need to get furious. Everyone comes to my shop to stare at her. That's okay. Give me her office address. That will be 1000. l'm telling you, you cannot go inside. How about now?. You're trying to bribe me? Now?. This isn't ajoke. Now?. l.. Sir...we can't allow you without permission. Now?. Will you wrap up everything in 15 minutes? Make my visitor's card. Babli. Babli. Madam. Tara Sharma. - lt's there. Hi. You? Wow. Can you see the Qutub Minar? How did you come in? - Through the door. Your shirt's at home. l'll collect it later. Right now, l want to tell you something. - What? l love you! - What? l swear on mother. Although, l've never seen my mother. But since l saw you.. ..you're the only one l've been thinking about. And today l'm going to express my feelings here. You have one minute. That's enough. Your time starts now. My name's Babli. lt's a bit strange, but that's it. l don't have any parents, so no surname. l was raised in Jai Hind Orphanage. l studied till 8th Grade, but don't remember a thing. But l'm the best mechanic. A-1. Till now l just loved one person. Myself. But now l will love you too. And l'll shower all my love on you. Until you don't say stop. l live with T2. He's a cute boy. Our orphanage's really big. We can live their comfortably after we're married. We can cook together, otherwise there's Masterji. l want two kids. One like you and other handsome like me. Their names will be Rekha and Amitabh. They're my favourites. After that, l'll.. Enough. Aren't you getting a little vulgar? l'll be right back. Two minutes. Security. This is manager Tara Sharma speaking. Come to the 8th floor, now! Hey, guys, listen up. Gather around. Come here. Let me introduce you. His name's Babli. He's an orphan, so he has no surname either. Right? He couldn't pass 8th grade. And he's here proposing marriage to me. You know, he's even decided.. ..the names of our children. Madam. What's wrong, madam? Who do you think you are? Have you ever seen yourself in the mirror? You look like a manner less idiot. What did you think? You'll say ''l Love You'' and l'll be floored? How dare you? Security. Throw him out right now. Just get him out. - Yes. - Get lost. You humiliated my love. But l'm still smiling. Do you know why? - Because you're shameless. l am...what l am. But you're still a kid. Better grow up. l want to spend my life with you. Come on. Move aside. - Come on. Sir. Sir, wait. Keep this. Why? Keep the money, you did yourjob. Yes, but you were heart-broken. l have no heart, only guts. And it never breaks. Keep the money. You didn't pay heed to my advice. She humiliated you, didn't she? Why ask when you know?. How about we do some work? Or do we just go back home? - No. We've come this far.. ..we won't go back empty-handed. Oh! Commitment! Babli. Come here. lt's a brand new car. You can still smell the fresh paint. Let's take this one. Otherwise it will get a tan under the hot sun. Bye, guys. My car. My car was right here, the new red one. Security! Now we'll head to Chandigarh. Security! Here you go, chassis no. Don't scare me. No, ma'am. We don't have your car. l think you should go to the police station. Sign here. ls this the FlR? Ask him. He's in-charge. Sir, can l get a receipt of the FlR? Why? - For the insurance. You can't just file an FlR so easily, dear. lt takes time. We've just made an entry into the register. Now we'll investigate. What? lnvestigate! Come here. Keep seated, l'll be right back. - What? The girl's desperate. Build some pressure on her. - Pressure. She'll definitely agree to pay up 10-15000. We'll buy a microwave oven. 25 liters. Shut up! She's in trouble. We should help her. And you're looking to make some quick dough. You hog on 'biryani' all day. l need some rest in the kitchen as well. You married me. You couldn't give me a kid.. ..you could at least look after me. You're so corrupt. One day l'll suspend you. Suspend! - Just try. You will have to live alone. l'll move into my mom's home. Mom? Witch! Always taking advantage because l'm a man. Sir. lf you conduct the investigation soon.. ..then maybe you can find my car. - Yes.. Look, the police will put in their best efforts.. ..to find your car. - Yes. But...you do something as well. What? Do l have to tell you everything? Money! Are you asking for bribe? l want my car back? - Yes.. You're getting furious for no reason. The police can only try. Whether you get your car back or not.. ..depends on the one who stole it. Right? - Yes, sir. Right, Bhagat Singh. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. See, everyone agrees. Good for nothing! No need to get too romantic. l see. So you're on strike today. What else do you expect me to do? Move. You sound so angry. What's wrong? As if you don't know. You blackmail me into doing all the wrong things. She was such a sweet girl. l wonder what she might be thinking about me.. ..that what a corrupt officer l am. You maligned my reputation. You're such a fool. You're reputation isn't going to earn you anything. l only say it for your own interest. You're healthy now. Tomorrow when you retire, if you fall sick.. ..won't we need money to look after you? We don't have any children anyway. Again about the children. You humiliate my manliness intentionally. Let's get tested and find out who's incompetent. Why should l get tested? l'm 53 years old. At this age women go through menopause. Don't try to teach me. Men have menopause. How can women get it? - Want to bet? Google it. Vicky Donor? But 'Menopause' has Men.. No, no, let's settle this first. Either you get yourself tested or adopt a child. l'm fed up of listening to your taunts. Get in bed first, your highness, you'll feel better. No, no, no. We've to take this decision first. Yes. Fine, we'll adopt a kid. Don't get upset. Now climb in. Really, dear. You'll adopt a kid. Swear on me. l want a son. - No, daughter. Son. - Daughter. Don't bargain with me. l want a son. - Done. Now give me a tight hug. Come on. ''As the soap slips on my hot body.'' ''The heart craves for young lass.'' ''The cold water feels so thrilling.'' ''Shamelessness drips from the eyes, the lips.'' 'Because you're shameless.' Hi. Uncle's shirt. Babli. How are you? Wonderful, aunt. For me? Bless you, son. Aunt. lt feels so remorse in here. l can sense sadness in the air! Her car's been stolen, son. - When? Last week. lt was parked right outside her office. Brand new Mercedes. She spent all her earnings to buy the car. Someone stole it. And, mom. Why don't you just announce it to the world? This is no charade. She's just telling me. - What do you care? Take your shirt and get out. Just get out. - Tara. Tara, listen. Son, you better leave. lt's not your fault. But if you stay here she won't stop crying. Please go... Once we're rich, we'll buy silver wrenches. Bro. Babli. l'm talking to you. Are you deaf? T2. - Yes. How many cars have we stolen until now?. 20 big ones, 5 small ones, 2 imported. Why? You want to pay their taxes? Have you ever thought about those.. ..whose car gets stolen? What else? He gets insurance, we get the car. Tit for tat. The last car we stole. - Yes. That was Tara's car. What? How do you know?. Her mother told me. Fine. At least we taught them a lesson. The consequences of troubling my Babli. No, T2. That girl's my love. l love her. l saw her crying today, it really hurt. But you don't have a heart, only guts. But it still pains. People built Taj Mahal to mark their love. Can't l return her car? The car's been sold, bro. lt's parked in Chandigarh, refurbished like new. So what? lf a stolen car can get to Chandigarh.. ..then it can come back too. Steal again? Why do you buy white bread? You should buy brown bread. - lt's okay. What's so great about brown bread? You've been eating white bread since you were a kid. Hi. Mom, walk faster. - Hi, aunt. - l'm walking faster. l can't gallop like a horse. Babli. Hello, aunt. Let me carry that. - No need. And stop following me. Get that? l wasn't following you, madam. l just walked up to you from the front. - Yes. Did l ask for help? - Did l help you? l'm talking to aunt. - He's just helping. l hate you, mom. - She's upset again. l'll lighten her mood. Tara, your car's in Chandigarh. See. Didn't l tell you? Your really charming, son. - Thank you, aunt. ls this ajoke? - No. l swear on your mom. Your car's in Chandigarh, Tara. Come with me, and l can get it back. But, son. How do you know.. ..the car's in Chandigarh? l investigated. l've connections, aunt. What connections? Didn't l tell you, l'm a car mechanic? Car...mechanic, thieves, spare-part dealers.. ..they're all connected. We know everything. Why can't the police find out? Police? You expect the thieves to be the protectors? They get a heavy commission. Why will they find your car? They are all corrupt, aunt. - Right. Why do l believe you? - Don't. You'll definitely get insurance. Right, aunt. - But.. l just wanted to do a good deed. l learnt this when l was a kid. We always have to face opposite of what we do. Do good and good things will happen to you. Show compassion and people will remember you. That means, good equals good. Compassion equals reminiscence. Get that, beauty. Why do you want to help me? l can't say that in aunt's presence. Shameless. Mom, let's go. Let's go. l don't want to talk to him. Tara. Go to Chandigarh. There's no harm in trying. Cars get stolen all the time, mom. They aren't found so easily. But you are getting yours back. What if he rapes me? - Shut up. Don't talk nonsense! l'm your mom. l've years of experience. My heart says Babli's naughty.. ..but he's not bad at heart.

Wow! - Today is my happy birthday. Whose? - All of us. We were raised in an orphanage. Fatherless and lonely. No one knows when their birthday is. So we celebrate it on the same day. Eat it. - So sweet. Happy birthday. - Take a bite. - Taste it. That's it. You see, son. l'm on a diet. God bless your figure, aunt. You're looking so sweet, l want to marry you.

Couldn't we take a bus? No, that's below my standard. Hello, aunt. - Bless you, son. For you. - Thank you. Best of luck to you, go. Lollypop? Take it. lt's anti-boring. Look, Babli. l know you're going out of your way to help me. But better tell me if you want something in return. From you? - Yes. What can you give... ...a handsome hunk like me? A tight slap. Mind your manners. l won't be fooled by you. You're in my car. When will you come in my arms? Know your stature? - Why? What's wrong? l've a nice job. l don't beg. Mechanic. Mechanics are doctors. Doctors of cars. Politicians, ministers, film-stars, businessmen. l treat everyone's car. l just don't have a glass office like you do. So what? No reputation either. - Who needs that? ln my line of work, you need only two things. Courage and talent. And l've both. You're so arrogant about yourjob, aren't you? Why do you hate my job so much? Fine. Marry me. l'll change my entire life for you. So, will you? Keep your eyes on the road. Shameless. ''When l saw you, l realized sweetheart.'' ''That love's crazy.'' Tara. What the.. What are you doing here? Staring at you. Why? l've been slogging since morning.. ..while you're comfortably snoring away. Come on. Change seats. You were sleepy, weren't you? Not anymore. Look ahead. That's where l'm looking. What a view. l think honey runs through your veins, not blood. You're so beautiful. Like ca...shew! There, l got permission to see. Your name should've been 'Shameless'. - Done. You're Tara Sharma, and l'm Babli Besharam. Good. But someday every girl.. ..has to take on her husband's name. You're a Sharma until now. Now you'll be 'Besharam'. Put on your glasses. lf l see your eyes again, l'll crash this car. ''How do l convey the condition of my heart?'' ''Do l tell you...or keep it to myself, what do l do?'' ''Your heart's so helpless.'' ''lt's shameless, doesn't pay heed.'' ''lt's good for nothing.'' ''You make my heart restless.'' ''Why do l love you?'' ''How do l convey the condition of my heart?'' ''Do l tell you...or keep it to myself, what do l do?'' ''Your heart's so helpless.'' ''lt's shameless, doesn't pay heed.'' ''lt's good for nothing.'' ''You make my heart restless.'' ''Why do l love you?'' ''l wonder why your heart's...in love with me?'' ''There are others waiting...in the line.'' ''l can't stop my heart, no matter how much l try.'' ''l try to scare it, but it pays no heed.'' ''lt's completely floored by you.'' ''Try to think something new.'' ''Say something new.'' ''You make my heart restless.'' ''Why do l love you?'' ''You make my heart restless.'' ''Why do l love you?'' Tara. Tara, your car. Your car. That's not mine. My number plate's of Delhi. The number plate's been changed. Stop the car. How do you know?. l changed the number, wouldn't l know?. Stop the car. What the.. Tara, control. You stole my car? l hope you don't mind sharing a bed with me. How dare you? - No need to sulk. l'm just joking. My room's different. Be honest, Babli. How many cars have you stolen till now?. Honesty can't give you a square meal, madam. lt does to me. Just tell me. No. You can't bear you. Aren't you ashamed? - You call me shameless. Babli, l'm being serious. - l'm serious as well, Tara. Who are you to point a finger at me? Just because you make more money.. ..and studied in an English college.. ..you think you can judge me? What's the point in knowing, what l did and why? Whatever l did, l couldn't tell right from wrong. l had no parents or family to teach me. What did you want me to do for earning a square meal? Don't l have a right to live? So you resorted to stealing. lt was desperate times. But l didn't do it to become rich. l stole cars only to satiate my hunger. Mine and other orphans like me.. ..whose parents leave them to die. l did what l thought was right. Nothing can ever justify any wrong deed. Did you ever think about that? That's why l am in love with you, Tara. You're the only one who's showing me the right path. l want to leave everything for you. Turn into a descent man. Will you give me a chance? ''l wonder why every happiness..'' ''..now seems incomplete?'' Hi. ''Why didn't l realise, you were missing in my life?'' l love you. ''Yes, l do. Yes, l do.'' ''You touched my heart, with your love.'' ''lt's you. Only you.'' Marry me. l can change my entire life for you. ''lt's you. Only you.'' ''What l thought was sadness, now seems bliss.'' He's naughty, but good at heart. ''You should've said it, because l couldn't say it.'' ''Yes, l do. Yes, l do.'' ''You touched my heart, with your love.'' ''lt's you. Only you.'' ''lt's you. Only you.'' ''Come, give me a hug.'' ''Let's erase this distance.'' ''Don't make me yearn any longer.'' ''O Shameless, don't be shy.'' ''My heart's fallen for you.'' ''Beloved.'' ''Beloved.'' ''You touched my heart, with your love.'' ''lt's you. Only you.'' Bheem Singh Chandel. Chandigarh's Money Laundering mafia King. He's a powerful guy.
