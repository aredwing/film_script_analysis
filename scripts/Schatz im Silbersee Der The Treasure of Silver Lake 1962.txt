Here is an Indian symbol: A bumel which a white rock licks. That means drawing salt water. Then that is fixed the great salt lake. Look, the sun sets the direction on. Pal west. This path runs through the gap Spoken to the waterfalls... and then to 't Silver Lake. According to the map 't more surrounded by steep cliffs. In places that are roben flat... where waterfalls along flows into the lake. Exactly. The waterfall shines as silver. So it is not referred to the treasure? There is only one way to the Silver Lake: Via 's northwest. Through a crack in the rocks. We are on the right track. - Above the lake is a cave. - This is the treasure. The old chief was right. That wealth brings only misfortune. They were just like you Dad can kill. I feel doin 'it, Fred. Your father was such a simple man. I previously thought that it was well rewarded... and the evil was punished. But it was not. - The good guys always suffer. - Bullshit. That is not true. Oh, yes, if it is just. But this time it will be different. I grab my dad's killer though 't my death. - With bare hands, I will... - Hold on, Fred. I know that the terrible for you to... I can not here me resign.

A young man is always needed. I not only remain behind, because I am willing... to the treasure to find. I just wanted to lose. - Halt. Here we save our camp. - Dismount. Colonel, look at the men agree. I have rarely seen such a mess. Without the map we find it never Silver Lake. Easy. Schuyler is with 60 men to El Doro. Hartley already there waiting on us. But then Patterson first to the treasure. - That we should avoid. - We will also do. Come baby, I will do you no harm. Be 's nice, rotinsect. Wait a minute. Monster, I get you later. Do not laugh. The Papilio polymnestor parinda is extremely rare. I like to believe that. But I would be careful. There is a lot of scum in the neighborhood. I got a good horse and a good rifle.
