It's very brave of you to come forward. It's gonna be dark soon. Well, then, let's not waste time. We've still got to examine that site on the opposite bank. Looks to be another mass grave. Oh, my God. Over here! She's dead! The head was crushed beyond recognition. The killer is named Gustave by local villagers. Americans are horrified by the senseless, bloodthirsty attack on the reputation of a devoted public servant by a desperate, ratings-hungry network. This kind of irresponsible reporting will not go unanswered. The Network News Channel is under fire for a story it recently aired accusing Senator Richard Porter of soliciting bribes from defense contractors. I'm watching it right now. I'll call you back. That shot's out of focus. ...on the network's weekly news magazine program. NNC based the allegation... - This shot is out of focus. - Chill. I need to hear this. - You can't see it. - Don't mention my name. ...so-called Portergate, NNC's Tim Manfrey could not be reached for comment. Shit! OK. Pimp My Ride's on right now. Good chance Roger's not even watching. Tim, Roger wants to see you ASAP. That was quick. Nice working with you. - Bob. - Yeah? You need a new cameraman? I'm just joking, Tim. Seriously. A crocodile attack has claimed the life of world-renowned... You can't be serious about Porter. The guy's a parasite. Not now. We'll talk about it later. You know Aviva Masters? Sure. The animal reporter. Sorry. I didn't mean that to sound condescending. I liked your piece on feline leukemia. My mom, she has a cat. Been following the Catherine Andrews story? That the lady that got munched? ...a scene of unspeakable carnage. It's a Grimm's fairy tale. The hideous dragon, Gustave, - comes in the night... - Gustave? Gustave. It's what the locals call him. He's a legend. Mm. Want me to produce a story on this crocodile? Yeah, and I want you to capture it. What? Matt Collins is a top croc expert. He's designed and built a special steel cage. He says he can take Gustave alive. They show signs of remarkable intelligence. The Burundi government has approved a limited expedition. So I want you to go in light, stake out his swamp, and bag this crocodile in time for sweeps. Network News Channel will finance the hunt in exchange for exclusive rights. - Rog, Burundi's a war zone. - You'll be fine. For the moment there's a ceasefire. My contact assured me as long as you keep out of local politics, he can guarantee your safety. We'll have to pick up a local guide, but, beyond that, I'm thinking we just take a skeleton crew, you, me, and a cameraman. No offense, but this ain't my sort of thing. - What sort of thing is that? - When Animals Attack! - World's Scariest Monsters. - This isn't trash TV. - This is man against nature. - Aviva. Could you give us a minute? Tim and I have a little contract issue to discuss. - It was nice meeting you. - You too. Come on, Rog. She interviews pet psychics. She's looking to prove herself as a journalist. And you wanna show the world who's got the biggest croc. You fucked up. I didn't know the evidence was cooked! You didn't wanna know. You're gonna find it very hard to change the world when you're pulling espressos at Starbucks. ...continued efforts to preserve their habitat will ensure the survival of future generations. Isn't that right, Junior? I'm Matt Collins. Join me next time on Bite Size. So we're approaching Tanganyika. Right there's the Rusizi River. Do you see it up north? That's where we're gonna be. It's gorgeous. It is if you're high enough above it. Burundi's the poorest country in the world, number one. The last 40 years, a civil war between the Hutu and Tutsi, you've got famine, disease, terrorism, corruption. Apart from that, yeah, the place is gorgeous. Hey, you're my boy, you know I love you, but right now your attitude sucks. For real. By the way, you think Roger's tapping that ass? She got a nice ass. He has the tappin' apparatus. I think he is. Come on, man. You gotta be a little bit excited about this. We're going to Africa. Yes! This is it! This is the cradle of all mankind. This is where it began. This is where Bryant Gumbel is from. Come on, Tim! We're gonna have a good time. Shit. Hey, welcome. Please, no filming. It is against the law in here. I'm Hahutu Mkwesa, but you call me by my Western name. - Harry. - You have a beautiful country. Thank you. Your passports, please. Follow me. What's up, man? Fuck you too. I'm from Brooklyn. You have rooms at the hotel. You are already checked in. We need to meet a guide. We have to leave immediately. This is Africa, my brother. Nothing happens immediately. Besides, your transport was required for a brief military operation and not all of the fuel was delivered. - So when do we leave? - That's hard to say, ma'am. But the accommodations are most comfortable. Rog, your pal says we gotta wait around indefinitely. I mean, why should you hold up your end of the deal? - He's not legit. - Sir, you misunderstand me. It's just a matter of time... We can hook up with Roberts in the Sudan. - By the end of the week. - Or... we pull out. - Tomorrow. - Hold on, Roger. The boat will be ready tomorrow. Rog, I'll call you back. Harry, much appreciated. Thank you. Was that satellite phone even on? Haven't even charged it yet. Nice. This croc is big, really big, maybe up to nine meters. - 25, even 30 feet. - Nine meters? One fat bastard. They'll grow indefinitely depending on food intake. And they can live over 100 years. - Like dinosaurs. - Older. They haven't changed much since the Triassic. Why should they? They're the most efficient killing machines on the planet. - Apart from Homo sapiens. - What are these marks? Scar tissue. He's been shot many times. Gustave. Motherfucker's bulletproof? - Gustave. He take my cousin. - Are you sure it was him? Everybody knows this Gustave. He killed hundreds. Hundreds? Yeah, right, man. - It'd make the news. - Why would it? Thousands have died here. - That hasn't made the news. - What...? This crocodile's like O.J. Simpson. He messed up when he killed that white woman. Which, let's face it, is the only reason you people are here. For you, this monster is entertainment. - But here we know better. - Do we really need that? You can never be too careful, ma'am. You'll travel through territory controlled by Little Gustave. - Little Gustave? - He rules the Upper Rusizi. Got his name from the crocodile. It's hard to say whose blood is colder. But don't worry, these guys will be accompanying you all the way. Good luck. Hey, man. I didn't catch your name. I'm Tim. Nice chatting with you. Are you working on my lead-ins? No. Working on the real story, the HMO scandal. You wouldn't believe the shit... Right, right. This isn't a real story. Well... let's face it, catching a killer croc, it ain't the makings of a Pulitzer Prize. Like the Porter story you just blew? Question your assumptions, Tim. Isn't that the first thing they teach you? Where did you learn that, modeling school? No, Columbia School of Journalism. You are such an asshole, aren't you? Well... - What the hell's going on? - Some guys were shooting at us. Who are those guys? I thought there was a ceasefire. This is a war zone. People shoot at each other. Jacob Krieg! Mr. Krieg! Jacob, I'm Aviva Masters. Roger sends his regards... I received word this morning there has been another attack. A little girl was killed in a village 30km north. - Say we get moving. - The rapids are too rough. We'll have to drive. Problem is, the village is close to Little Gustave's territory. - The warlord? - Uh-huh. We'll go see him, explain we're a scientific expedition with no interest in politics. Nobody sees Little Gustave. Except those he means to kill. - So, what do we do? - We take our chances. We leave first thing in the morning. Are you looking for something? - You're a poacher. - No, I'm a licensed hunter. I started this expedition to save Gustave from people like you. It's a wonder there are any crocs left. You may be grateful for my skills. We're after a man-eater. There are more than enough human beings on this planet. The crocodile is exceptional, a creature of far greater value. You don't seem stupid, so you must be insane. This croc cannot be taken alive. I'll call the whole thing off. I'll pack up my gear and send the Americans home before I allow you to harm this animal. Do you understand me? Sir, I'm only your humble guide. Not even Gustave can bite through this reinforced steel. Once inside, his weight will activate a pressure plate, triggering a spring-loaded door. Dr. Collins has designed this trap so that no harm can come to this extraordinary creature... - Cut! Cut. - What? Still a little chipper. Oh! You know, this is starting to get abusive. Dial it down. We're not shooting a toothpaste commercial. Not all of us can be clinically depressed. Oh, shit! There's Gustave! Oh, shit! Shit! I got it right here! - Funny, man. - Let's do it again. I got both of y'all, too. Aviva, it's Gustave! It's Gu... He's waving at you! These people! It's unbelievable. Already back in the river like nothing's happened. The river's their source of food, their only water. - Their life. - Life is right. Y'all ever seen Jaws, the movie? Might wanna check that out. That to warn the villagers? They kept him tied out there as an offering to the croc. That's not terribly effective. I'm all for tradition, but I can't leave him like that. That is one ugly-ass dog. Oh, look at you. Oh. Hi, little guy. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. There's a shaman who lives near here. We'll have to ask for his blessing if we want the villagers to help us. Tonight the feast is for gratitude, luck. This is delicious. What is this? Nyama ni nyama tu, in Swahili. It means "all meat is meat". In other words, don't ask. - Ooh! - Bravo. Thank you. - He says it's your turn. - For what? To perform one of your native songs. No, no. We no sing. Drink. - Eat. - And eat. They're staring. Why did you go and pick a Negro spiritual? In Africa? This is it. I can't believe you're gonna make me do this. Good, huh? Yeah. You know what? Let's just remix. Can you give me a beat? A one, two, three. Go. This shit is embarrassing. Gwanyana is one of the village elders, a sort of priest shaman. He is performing a rite for the soul of the little girl. He says Kirunga came again. Kirunga is like a bad spirit. Evil men call to him, men like Little Gustave. The good people are weak. They are the ones who suffer. They live in fear. Kirunga surrounds them. Little Gustave rules the land. The crocodile rules the water. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey. Naughty By Nature, right? This is some good shit. Yeah. I'll have a nickel bag of that. - It's meant to be a blessing. - It is. One more hit? One more hit? No? OK. I'll pass. I'm allergic to mumbo jumbo. If you'll excuse me. Hey! What's he saying? He says that we'll find what we seek. Then we'll find death. You, me, all, we make Kirunga. Kirunga kill. Kirunga save. Must face. I think I know where Gustave might be. Recent attacks are focused around a small island in Kibira Wetlands, a swamp a few miles to the northeast. We need a lot of hands, a lot of help. Half of you on this side and half on the other side. Why carry the cage? Let's take this road. Suicide. The shaman says it's under the control - of Hutu militia. - Little Gustave? The shaman has been a thorn in his side, trying to get the village to stand up to the warlords. Isn't that why we have these guys, to protect us? They can't stop a landmine. Plus, the militia carry rockets. Most of them are teenagers, high on amphetamines. They'd kill you for that watch you're wearing. Come on, lift! We need more people on the side here. - OK, you ready? - Hey, what are you doing? - You are taking someone's spot. - What? I'm helping out. Come on, they need this job. Come on. Give me a break. I'm just trying to help. Fight! Kick his ass! The more you help, the worse it gets. It doesn't mean you shouldn't try. Set up camp far enough away that we don't spook it. There's a perfect spot a kilometer back. - My own blend. - A little early for me, man. - Just take a whiff. - What is it? Agh! Mother of God! A combination of blood/urine pheromones. I'll spread a trail in the water, leading to the cage. Never had much luck with croc bait. You'll see, from two kilometers, Gustave will come running with a hard-on. Tranquilizer darts won't work. They can't penetrate his scales. I'd never use tranqs. Too much danger of overdosing and drowning the animal. It's an electronic transmitter. All I need is one clear shot... ...and we'll always know where he is. Thank you very much. Asante. Asante sana. Thank you. Asante. Thank you. Thank you. Asante sana. You from America, Hollywood. Not yet, but I'm working on it. Your English is pretty good, though. How I get there, USA? Well, my people came on what you call a slave ship. But it's not so easy now. Breath mint? Take a couple of those. Sorry you can't come to the good old US of A, - but, hey, have a tic tac. - No. Sorry, your breath stinks bad. - Take a tic tac. - How we doing? It's getting there. - Don't tie him too close... - Oh! Oh! Shit! You couldn't wait till I was done? Jesus. You wanted to stake out the cage. Hey, let's go. It's a long walk to the water. Wiley. Wiley. Hi, buddy. Oh, good boy. - Wiley? - Yeah, like the coyote. - Got a problem with that too? - No, it's a good name. - Oh, you're cute! - No, you're not. - Want a beer? - Just ignore him. I do. You talk to dog. Pourquoi? Yeah, it's a thing we do where we come from. It's kinda pointless. - So where do you live, Jojo? - The bush my home. And your family, do they live around here? They are dead. Hey, we got something. Ooh. - Whoa, that's big. - That's huge. We brought a regular condom. We need a Magnum. - Is that him? - Yes, that's him. There you go. Dinner's served. Just get in the cage and I won't have to shoot you. Come on. Just do it. - Where'd it go? - Shit, I don't know. I don't understand. This cage has worked dozens of times. He's too smart. - There it is. - He's getting away. - I think I got him. - Nice shot. Where are you going? He won't be back tonight. Oh, shit. - I don't get it. - The goat must have escaped. - I don't see any blood. - Well, it rained last night. Must have washed away. OK, let's see what we got. Damn. Goat's here one minute, gone the next. Guess the rain washed out the motion sensors, killed the feed to the tent as well. We got nothing. I'm gonna go to camp, drop off this computer and go shoot some shots, get a little local flavor. All right. Be careful. Dangerous place. Thanks, Mom. Raw meat. I need raw meat. You said they needed live bait. It's always preferable. But crocs do eat carrion. He'll come. - I can feel it. - Let me see that thing. This signal hasn't moved since last night. He probably just... That woke him up. And you just watched that happen? What was I supposed to do, attack them with my Telephoto? - Well, we have to do something. - I did. Aviva, I filmed an entire family getting slaughtered, OK? I'll have nightmares for the rest of my life behind this shit. OK. Well, we'll call the police. - What police? - When we get back to Bujumbura, we'll hand the evidence over to the U.N. - It's the best we can do. - They're powerless. There's nothing to be done. How can you say that? He was your friend. And I'll miss him. But I've lost many friends here. We have an opportunity here. We can make a difference, we can expose the murders that are going on every day, change the focus of the story. - You are joking, right? - No, I'm not. "Next: dying Africans." Nobody wants to TiVo that shit. - Don't be cynical, Steven. - I'm not being cynical. Darfur: no one cares. Rwanda: who gives a shit? White people don't give a damn about black-on-black crime when it's around the corner from their house. Do you really think they give a shit about a bunch of dying Africans - I do. - That's one. Tim. I thought you were a journalist. You wanted a real story. Well, now you have one. It's none of our business. I suggest we pretend it never happened. She's right. We got a responsibility to show people what's happening here. They already know, Tim. They just don't care. We make them care. We put a face on the suffering. - You realize we could die here? - Yeah, I know. Come on, man. All right. I hate you so much sometimes. Oh, shit. Gustave! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! - Hurry! - Jojo! Get the fuck out of the cage! Jojo, hold on! He's out there. Are you fucking insane? Jojo's in there! Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! You idiot. It has to die. Tim! Tim! Get out of the water! Come on. Jojo. OK, get him on his side. That's it. OK. Shh. Jojo, why? Why? I get you Gustave, maybe you take me to America. Oh, man. Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?! - Stop it! What are you doing? - Back off! Jojo! Jojo! Jojo! Your precious man-eater is still alive. Oh, shit. Where's Aviva? Hey! What are you doing? OK. No! No! No! Please stop. Get off me! No! Aviva? Aviva, what happened? What happened? What's going...? What happened? Oh, my God. That fucking grenade drove him up here. - He's moving away now. - Get what gear you can salvage. - We'll pull out tomorrow. - OK. Shit. Bit of a setback, I'll grant you, but we're so close. It's over. I know we're all upset right now, but things'll look different in the morning. We're going home. I don't want any more blood on my hands. In shallow water, we'll... I don't give a damn about your crocodile! I never did. A man's dead. We're out first thing in the morning. - No. We leave now. - Are you kidding? - It's pitch black out there. - I know the trail. I can get us back to the village. - It's not safe here. Come on. - Gustave's at least a mile off. I'm not talking about Gustave. Where's the computer? Where's the computer? He works for Little Gustave. Where is he taking us? To the water. Easier to dump our bodies. - I'm gonna make my move. - You won't make two feet. Six on one, half a dozen on the other. Oh, God. Oh, God. Sorry I called you an asshole. Sorry I am one. Oh, God. Oh, God. - What? What? - On your knees. On your knees. On your knees! Knees! Fuck you. I'm not getting on my knees. No! - You OK? - Yeah. Jojo? If I have to shove you up my ass to get your through customs, you are going to America. Thank you. We need to get a first-aid kit. It was destroyed back at the camp. There's one in the fishing hut. You call this a first-aid kit? Morphine. Rachel, it's Aviva Masters. Can you hear me? - Forgive me if it hurts. - I need to speak to Roger. OK, all right, listen. I need to get him a message. I don't care what he's doing. People are trying to kill us here. Rachel! Can you hear me? He has our location. Send an airlift immediately. Rachel? Ugh! Rachel! - Shit. - Ona, my love. - Damn it! - We're so fucked. - My wife. - I don't know if she heard me. - Gustave killed my wife. - What? Ona was bathing in the river, right in front of our home, as she'd done a thousand times. Those scars, I gave him those. I shot him again and again. As he took her under... ...I heard her scream. He's coming. Jojo, there! Ona, forgive me. No revenge. - Jojo, can you see anything? - No, nothing! I broke my promise. I'm sorry. Fuck! - Matt! - Run! Run! Run! Matt! Oh, Jesus! - Grab him, guys! You have him? - Come on! Hold on! Grab something! Krieg! Get Krieg! - Let me go. - No. There's still time. Come on. No. He dies with me. What are you doing? He did it. I'm sick of this. I feel like a pork chop on Queen Latifah's dinner plate. - I say we make a run for it. - I wouldn't. He's still in the grass. Maybe he's sleeping. Or digesting, making room for more. Hey, Matt. Hey, Matt! What are you doing? Praying to Satan? Latin nomenclature. Helps me stay awake. Oh. Well, join the party. How much can this croc eat? When there's abundant food, they'll eat until they're sick. Then they'll throw up and eat some more. Really, it's appropriate that we die this way. Can we just talk about something else, please? OK, Aviva. What's the deal with you and Roger Sharpe? I go to dinner with him, OK? We go to art openings. And... - Well, people just assume. - Of course they do. Do you think if he gave a damn about me, I'd be here right now? He just, he likes to be seen with women. Roger's gay? The international playboy? Married six times? He's not tapping your ass, somebody's tapping his? OK, you guys, don't say anything, please. Aviva, who the fuck am I gonna tell, Jojo? Hey, Jojo, you know Roger Sharpe? - No. - He's gay. OK. Roger got the message. They're looking for the camp. Come on. Aviva. Let me go first. Steven, don't splash. You'll attract him. Come on, guys! Hey! Down! Matt, get down! What's happening? I'm dead. Why did they kill him? What did they want? Searching. Look for computer. Little Gustave, he killed the shaman. - It's on the tape. - At the bottom of the swamp. You go tell 'em. We'll wait here. That's all you got? They got AK-47s, Jojo. Who the fuck are you, Lee Harvey Oswald? Shit. Come on, come on! Run! Split up! Go for the trees! Oh! Fuck! I hate fucking Africa! Let him go! Let him go! Now! Let him go! Jojo, you OK? Shut your mouth! Please! Don't move! Don't move! I don't want to shoot you! I'd never say this in front of a bunch of white people, but slavery was a good thing. Anything you gotta do to get the fuck out of Africa is OK with me. Steven! Shit. I gotta find him. Here, take Jojo. - Tim. - I'll be fine. Promise. Keep going. Move. Go! Punk bitch. Shit! Steven! Steven! Steven! Steven! Jojo, I'll never turn my back on you. Come on. Come on, come on. No. Come on. Stay with me. Stay with me. Jojo. Oh, no. Tim. He's lost a lot of blood. I... I don't know what to do. Where's Steven? I can't find him. No. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know what the shaman meant now when they said it's our fault. What? What do you mean? Gustave. Civil war, genocide, all those bodies floating in the water. That's where he got a taste for human flesh. We make, create, our own monsters. - It's Harry. That's Harry. - Here! Mr. Manfrey, Roger Sharpe has been frantic. We've been looking for you all over. I can't believe you found us. This boy is shot. We can't find our cameraman. - I've never been so scared. - Where are the others? - They're dead. - All of them? What a terrifying ordeal you must have been through. What has become of the rest of the tape? What? We need to find Steven and get Jojo to a doctor. It will be best to recover your equipment now. Anything of value does tend to disappear. I don't care about the tape anymore. It doesn't matter. I just wanna find Steven. You are a very perceptive man, Mr. Manfrey. It's best if we are honest with one another. What do you mean? I was photographed in a rather compromising position. Where is the computer? He works for Little Gustave too. So many of us here lead double lives. In the city I'm just another functionary, but in the bush, I am God. He is little Gustave. Very few people are aware of that. We lost the laptop. Besides, you weren't even recognizable. A man in my position can never stop worrying. Harry, we have to get Jojo to a hospital. Please, he's gonna die. Isn't that tragic? Thousands like him die every day here in Africa. - Where is the computer? - Why would we tell you, Harry? You're just gonna shoot us. Fuck you! There are worse things than death. Harry, wait! The computer. It's rigged with an electronic locator. You'll find it with this. I am not good with American toys. Take me to it. Tell me, did you ever find your crocodile? - Your men killed it. - A public service. So now there's only Little Gustave. Push it in. What the hell are you waiting for? Push it in! - What are you doing? - It's moonshine. - I'm a little nervous. Do you mind? - Drink up. Thanks. Come on! Must have dropped the computer up past the reeds there. We'll stay here. You go get it. Sit. Go. Jesus. Oh, man. I wonder who will come next. What pretty young reporter will be sent to tell the hideous story of your death? I got it. - Aviva! - Tim! You OK? Let's go. Don't worry. I have plenty more. Don't move. It's Wiley. Come on, Wiley! Come on! Aviva, no. Come here, Wiley. Wiley, come here. Aviva. Come on! Move it! Move! Hurry! - Come on! - Wiley, come! Go! Go! Go! Go! - Put it in low! - I'm trying, I'm trying. - You have it in low? - I know how to drive. It's stuck. It can't be stuck. It's a fucking Range Rover! Come on! Move! Watch out! Get him! Die, you piece of shit. - Let's go! - Hang on! - You... are you OK? - Yeah. Go! All right. Here's to Africa, Tim. All right, man. Put the camera down. Seriously, Tim. Please. Seriously. I'm behind the scenes. Behind the scenes. Put my fucking... Put my camera down. Tim, put my cam... Come on, man. This is childish, man. This is childish. Tim, drop the camera, take two steps back before somebody gets hurt. Shh. Shh.
