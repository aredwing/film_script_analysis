I've spent 17 years, making sure... that you don't turn into someone I'm ashamed of. You don't understand, I didn't even want to! You didn't want to, but you did anyways. This is a lifelong problem for you, Kylie. You need to learn to stand up for yourself. The Harrison's are expecting you at 7:00, It's a long drive... I want you out of here by 6:00. Okay guys, go right up to the door.

What makes you think they want me taking care of their kids? Yeah, just forget it! Hi guys! Hello? Morris's talking about expelling me. Really? You gotta tell him, we were just having fun. I had no idea of whom those assholes took the camera. Shut up, you little shit! I'm on the phone. I'm coming over. No, I'm not at home, babysitting tonight. Look, get me off the hook with Morris, this goes way for both of us. What the hell? Holy shit! Kylie! - Come on in. - Thanks. Hey, thanks for coming out all this way.
