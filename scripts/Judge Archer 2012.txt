He hates himself. He needs to be born again. Let him become a monk in name only. Listen closely. Write his name on a paper doll. It will take over his identity as a monk. Then he will vanish from the world. When you jump over the wall, the words spoken by the first person you meet will be your new name. Brother, you will start a new life with that name. Come back when you have one! Judge Archer! You! Who are you? - Judge Archer. - You? Yes! Come here. Let me take a look at you. Judge Archer is my name as well. From now on, you and I will share the same name. You have taken a cursed name. It has been used for six generations. Nobody with this name has met a good end. People who carry this name have a duty to deliver justice. Han Si, what are you doing? No more waiting. Why not? Doesn't Judge Archer mean anything to you? He disappeared three years ago. You said he'll come today. How can I trust you? Master Zhao, you have your broadsword with you. Don't let a stranger step in. We'll solve it ourselves. It's Judge Archer's signature. I don't know you. This is all you need to know. It's my fault. I'm sorry I bothered you. Good. And now settle it over a cup of tea. - Let's forget what happened. - It's over. Do not hold back now. With a single gold bar, you can buy a whole house. I was afraid they wouldn't sell. Why'd he shoot four arrows in a row? It's a tradition, symbolizing justice. It's not easy to cluster four arrows together. He can persuade others with his precision alone. Just by pulling a bowstring, he can stop fights between the schools? But you must remember that what they teach is all trickery. That's how they keep their students. After you've mastered archery, there is no secret in martial arts. These two ligaments here are essential in the art of archery. Always keep your chest out and your waist in. And you can feel them stretch when you pull the bow. He shows his strength by pulling on the bow. You and I are working together and it ends there. Hmm. He drank seven bottles in four hours. Judge Archer is respected by everyone. If he wants to get drunk, why does he have to disguise himself? Oh, you have many enemies. For to deliver justice is to make enemies. You cannot handle wine. You just want... to get drunk. The last Judge, your predecessor, lasted seven years. How long can you last? Let's see if I survive tonight. I challenge you... up close. Get out of the way. I'm crazy when I'm drunk. Stay away! What are you doing? It's my habit. I know this is a trap. What do you want? I shouldn't have lied... I'm sorry. I wanted to ask if you could help me. I am Judge Archer. I am concerned with martial arts... nothing more. I thought that if there was an injustice, you would step forward. To be Judge Archer is my destiny. It's the only purpose of my life. I cannot afford to make mistakes. I see that I was wrong. Leave... when you're finished. I want to ask one thing. Nothing happened... last night, right? Nothing. No one can bully me. We won't make a trade. But I can... help. My father was a member of the Tongmenghui Revolutionary Alliance. Most of its early members were forced into exile overseas, and many had foreign lovers abroad. He died in a conflict two years ago. The man who killed my father is no longer in power. These days, he only leaves his home twice a week, to go teach music class at the village middle school. Perhaps he has repented his actions. Repentance cannot change the past. My father will never breathe again. Where is Kong? He sold me the store and left. We had a deal, he gives me a pear every morning, and I pay every month. The smell of a pear in the morning is very refreshing. You're not young anymore, don't run. What if you'd tripped? To smell is to practice breathing. His gait is clumsy, but gentle. He must be a great master. I have shot at the target ten times. Should I continue? And so what if you have? The energy of the tree continues to overwhelm and overpower you. You are not brave enough to face it. You think I'm scared of a tree? That's not what I said. An experienced archer will always aim with his left foot forward, but look at your left foot, it's shying away. Give me an apple. Just one apple? The essence of archery is not concerned with the target, but with being at peace with oneself. For the apple. But wait, it's too much. It's your tip. I can't accept it, here's your change. Keep it. Guests are coming tonight. Bring me a box of fruit. Yes, sir. She is really flirtatious. She must be a mistress. Or she will become one sooner or later. Some rich man will surely take her. The way she sings opera is very seductive. The young man in blue wearing a scarf Seems so gentle and handsome He looks just like my husband They look exactly the same We'll pay you later. What happened? You don't remember? I remember it suddenly went dark. You passed out. It's singing opera, it's making me feel so weak. Will you eat it? Don't you have a smaller knife? Don't look at me like that. Every female opera singer carries a knife with her. The character in the opera is so gentle and loving. Where is he in real life? He ripped my dress last night and left first thing this morning. I walked back wearing his coat but he got very angry and told me I had to return it immediately. He treated me like a thief. What's wrong? I'll leave you the knife. Come and watch my performance tonight. No charge. This job... is not for me. You're being decent enough by coming in person. Thank you. Can't you do better? That's the blunt edge. I'm a martial artist. I can choose... to step in... or to stay out. Why did you do that? Master! Thank you. This is my room. I only reserved one. Book another. You deliver justice. And God will reward you. Maintaining justice requires willpower. When someone overpowers me, I have to defeat him. Or I can no longer be Judge Archer. This time I fight for myself. You fight for yourself? And the last time? Would you like some soup? But why? Why do I do it? How is your rich man? Very well. He should send a car for you. When he picked me up... he sent one. I haven't seen you for days. Something came up. Leave it, I'll peel another one. Mister... Can you hug me for a while? It's so cold. A skilled archer knows you must keep your heart pure. If you can cut cleanly, then you will treat others well. I don't want to go back. If you like me... take me with you. You can buy me for 30 apples. Fifteen apples then. Not one less. Remember, to deliver justice is to make enemies. You must live like a wanted criminal. Why there? It's a habit. Mmm. Here's my card. Wooden block printing. It costs a lot. For paper? It is worth a hundred meals, but it buys me higher status. Who's it from? The rich man? I paid for it. Who are you? Look in the left sleeve. Your hundred meals. No matter who you are, you're my man from now on. The warlords are all fighting amongst each other. Deserters and guns are everywhere. Find a man who has killed before. Where are you going? Leave the troupe. Go pack your stuff. I'll take you with me. I'm no longer Judge Archer. I'm free to leave. You see the gold bar on the table? Now come in, and have a seat. Stop right there. I'll lose a finger, but you'll die. You're too confident. My skills can solve any martial arts' conflict. Knife-throwing is crucial to archery. Do you trust my skills? Judge Archer. At 34, I became a master. I have been searching for someone worthy of my assistance... for 30 years now. You've found him. Commander Yang. He is in exile now, but I know he'll return to power soon. I was asked to take revenge. He betrays his friends. Someone always gets hurt in politics, martial arts are hard. It's even harder to find your leader. I will not let you kill him. I always thought that it was your energy that overwhelmed me. I never imagined it would be her. I will let Yang go on the condition that the woman who lied to me dies by my hand. Deal! That man is my husband. I've stayed with him for ten years. I will trade my life for Yang's. It's worth it, just do it. I'm a martial artist, not a criminal. I've made many mistakes. Kong... he was a fruit vendor in this village for many years. In just one day, the store was sold and he had moved away. It didn't make any sense. So... you sent a woman to spy on me. I am quite sure that I can defeat you. But for the sake of Commander Yang, I can't risk it. Eventually, I will find justice for my wife. Get her body. Before you step outside, first fit your face within the circle. If your ears align, you are balanced. Otherwise, you will lose your way. This is a means of self-examination. You must keep it in mind at all times. No! That is wrong. Never look at the bow when aiming. You'll miss the target. Thanks for your advice. It's a pity your great archery skills cannot help you understand people. Rest your eyes on the bow but on a woman also. The woman you love has been my master's wife for ten years now. In the end, my ambitious master has accomplished nothing. Commander Yang is his final hope. If I kill Yang... it will destroy our relationship. My parents have already passed away. I have only my master left. Who is he? Ten years ago, before my master met Yang, he turned the schools upside down. The up-close duel is the deadliest one in martial arts. My master excelled at it, he was the very best. Kuang? Yimin? Be careful. I have surpassed him. Break both of his hands and dump his body. I'll do it. When I die, don't mark the grave or put up a tombstone. Just bury me in the weeds. You have only learned how to shoot arrows, not how to deal with returning arrows. It is a shame that I cannot teach you. Leave him, he's mine. I have brought your bow for you. The orphanage is a sanctuary for runaways. You and me, we can stay here forever. Martial artists solve everything with Kung Fu. If I can defeat you, you stay here. It's a deal. You cannot win. The ligaments in your hand will break. Stop talking. Your hands... are useless. I use my elbow. With no strain on my hand. I have done this for years. An arrow can never return once it's been shot but people can. I had almost forgot that I still have a home. Commander Yang, I can't walk with you today. What happened? Fine then. You are the one who taught me how to smoke. And you told me that when a man gets frightened, he will smell so bad that you can't stand it. He has lost his powers. Someone's still worried about him. You joined Commander Liu's side? He is not one of the best. No one is perfect in times of chaos. Is Commander Yang the best? I promise to kill Yang fairly, out of respect for you. You and I will compete in Kung Fu for his life. If you lose, you must accept his fate. You were my protg. But I taught myself something better. Let's do spears. Get ready... I never taught you this. It's from our ancestors, you understand? Watch carefully. In martial arts, I made a huge mistake. For your sake I hope you choose... the right master. Your house collapsed many years ago. Empty houses collapse the fastest. And my sister... where did she go? It was very unfortunate. She was raped by Landlord Wang in front of the villagers. She wanted to keep her marriage a secret. She felt ashamed, so we didn't ask. Sister... this is how I learned archery. Spare my life! Spare my life! Spare my life! Spare my life! Spare my life! Spare my life! I don't deserve to be your executioner. To my sister, I am even worse than you. Spare my life! Spare my life! Spare my life! Brother... it hasn't been easy for you. Please bless me. Help me find my sister. Commander Yang has already contacted all of his former troops. Things will go smoothly. You've helped me a lot, so I'll do you a favor. I'll find Judge Archer... for you. I'm your wife. You were never my wife. For ten years... you were my servant. When I'm gone accompany Yang to the school. Thank you. You're welcome. No one will step forward? You want to fight? Where is he? Perhaps my sister never existed. But she led me to my true self. She is a revelation from Buddha. Sister... take care. You left. Why have you returned? There are few Kung Fu masters left, and they will only become rarer. I just want a one-on-one duel. There are no masters left, we're nobody. What you want, is to take her with you. My master has lost his leader again. There will never be another Judge Archer. At 21, I was so proud of my abilities. I expected to become a great leader one day. At 34, I realized that I would never succeed. And so I decided that I would help someone else succeed, but all the people I met were either incompetent or unfortunate. Why is this so? Yang's death has made me realize that it is because I myself have neither the talent nor the luck to be successful. All I have now is Kung Fu! I am 60 years old. I haven't done anything serious for a while. These days, it seems that everyone is looking for a faster way to do everything, but there is no shortcut in martial arts and there never will be. I am looking forward... to a duel with you. Yes. You could've killed him just then! As long as he is alive, he won't give up on finding another Yang. I've been with him for many years. As long as he is alive, I have no choice but to stay with him. What is it? Stealing a glance.
