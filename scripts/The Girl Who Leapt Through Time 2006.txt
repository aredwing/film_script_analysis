Here it comes! - There! - W-Whoa... Yeah! Ah! Damn! All right! So yesterday... - Huh? ... pudding... ...I missed out on pudding. What happened to the pudding? I bet your little sister beat you to it again. I was purposely saving it. How dare she eat it, that stupid little sister of mine! Watch it...! There! Aww, I did it again. Sis? Huh? - Sis? - What? What the...? Huh? Makoto! Makoto! What? Look up! Above you! Up? Ow! Th-That hurt... It's about time you got up. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time - Do you know what today is? - Why'd you turn off the alarm?! You turned it off yourself! I'm off now! - It's July 13, which is a "Nice Day". - You have a good day. - What's a "Nice Day"? - I'm in trouble! Seven, one, three could be read as "Na-I-Su". You're finally up, Makoto? - G'morning, Dad. - Oh, uh... G'morning. - I'm outta here! - Oh, Makoto! Hang on! What? Take this to your Auntie Witch after school. - Tell her it's from Grandma. - No way! I don't want to take that to school. - And... - Huh? Maybe you can ask her when she's going to get married. - Sure. - Good. I'm off! Have a good day. Oh, hi, Mako! Good morning! Sorry about the ruckus every morning. - Chiaki! - Hey, Makoto. You should work more time into your schedule. You're telling me?! I bet you fell back asleep after the alarm. Shut up! - What's in the basket? - Nothing! Come on. Tell me. Once again, in the nick of time. It'd be more refreshing if you'd just come late. You're early, Kousuke. Did you jerk off properly this morning? Shut up. You guys are always too late. - It's not in the nick of time. Look. - Huh? Are we lucky or what? I'm the lucky one. Huh? What'd you mean? You tend to say you're out of luck when you're unlucky. But I figured that had nothing to do with me. If anything, luck tends to be on my side. Now, why do you think your teacher was late today? A mini quiz? Yes, Hayakawa. Correct! What?! Nevertheless, luck still tends to be on my side. I also have good instincts too. Thanks to that, my grades are okay. I'm not exactly a brain, but I'm not an idiot either. You have five minutes left. Huh? I'm not an idiot... You have five minutes left. This is actually an exception. I'm not particularly adept at things... ...but I'm not so clumsy that people laugh at me. Looking back... ...I don't recall having too many mess ups that I cringe about. Ow! Hot! What're you doing, idiot?! Get the fire extinguisher! Hurry! Uh, yeah, right away! That was also an exception. - Are you all right? - I singed my bangs a bit. Normally I'm pretty careful, so I've never been badly injured. And I'm careful not to get involved in complicated social situations. H- Hey! Aww! What're you doing?! Come on! Look, you! - Oh? What's this? - Blood type horoscopes have nothing to do with this. - Hold it, you! - Blood type horoscopes have nothing to do with this. But it says they're not compatible. Could be dicey. Whether it's dicey or not is up to her to decide. What? Mathematics II Mini Quiz "Let's try harder next time!" Makoto. What? Liberal Arts/Sciences Are you going with liberal arts or sciences? Liberal Arts/Sciences - Haven't decided. You? - Not yet. Liberal Arts/Sciences Thank goodness. Liberal Arts/Sciences It's not something to decide quickly. Liberal Arts/Sciences You can't tell the future after all. Liberal Arts/Sciences It never ends. Liberal Arts/Sciences Liberal Arts/Sciences Hey, Makoto! How much longer are you gonna be? Then come and help me! You've gotta be kidding. Just hurry it up. Yeah. I wonder what Chiaki's going to choose. Sciences, I bet. He's not good with kanji. And he's amazing in math. But that's it. Why bring up Chiaki anyways? Hey, someone's left the hand-in notebooks here. Who's in charge of them? - Who is it? - It's you! What a hassle... There! Huh? Time waits for no one. Hm? Huh? What the...? Hm? It sounded like someone was here. Uh... Huh?! Hmm... A locked room... Huh? What's that? Are you an idiot or what?! You're killing me! You're laughing too much. Yeah. You're laughing too much. - But it's just so funny! - It's not funny. Wanna get a CT scan at my dad's clinic? - I'm fine, all right? - Be careful. Something might happen again. Nothing will happen. I don't need the hassle. But people don't just collapse for no reason. It's not for no reason! There was someone there! - Someone? - Like who? Well... Why would I play a prank on you and make you fall? Well... So I'm the culprit? Then, who could it have been? It sure is baking hot. It's almost summer vacation. Suck it up! That's right! Summer vacation! Let's go somewhere, the three of us! - Like where? - We can go to a night game. We went last month. That's all you want to do. - Then where? - Like the beach. Too hot. Then, how about a fireworks festival? We can wear yukatas. I don't have one. Where do you want to go, Kousuke? - The library. - What?! I'll keep to my studies. If you keep studying in this heat, you'll turn into an idiot. You guys don't study enough. Yeah, but I'm not going into medicine. Then, what are you going to do? Huh? Hmm... I'll become a hotel tycoon. Uh, what? Or maybe an oil tycoon. You've gotta think about this seriously. Hey, what are you going to do, Chiaki? Me? I'll... Ow! You guys need to get serious. Huh? Going home already? I forgot my mom wanted me to do something. Huh? Don't be such a party pooper. So, I'm stuck hanging with this guy alone? Well, see ya later! Hey. Hey! - Let's go! - But the elves are coming out soon! Good heavens... Hm? Hey! Watch where you're going! I'm sorry! Kuranose Shopping Arcade Huh? If this was just like... If this was just like any other day... ...there wouldn't have been any problems. But... Huh?! - What?! - I had forgotten... ...that today was my worst day. What?! No! No! I can't believe this is happening, but I'm going to die. This is my last day. If I knew this was going to happen, I would've gotten up earlier. I wouldn't have slept in, and I wouldn't have been late. I would've fried that tempura better. And I wouldn't have been slammed into by some idiot. I thought today was supposed to be a "Nice Day". Ow... Hey! Where were you looking?! I want to hear an apology! Apologize now! Uh, I'm sorry! Do you know why you have eyes? So you can see where you're going. Got it?! Y- Yes, I'm very sorry! Good heavens...! Hey, Mom. Look. Huh? Oh, my. It's already that time? Huh? Hm? How come? How come?! Hello? Miss Yoshiyama? "White Plum and Two Camellias" This painting is temporarily unavailable for display due to restoration. Tokyo Metropolitan Museum Now, take it easy. She'll be right down. Makoto! Auntie! Auntie Witch! Am I alive?! I am alive, right?! There's nothing strange about me, right? Hmm... There's something strange about your bangs. That was a time leap. Time leap?! - You were about to be hit by a train, right? - Yeah. - After being thrown off your bike? - Yeah! But when you came to, you had gone back a few minutes? - That's right! - That's what you call a time leap. - You see, time can never be reversed. - Never be reversed? - Time itself doesn't go back. - Hm. So what went back in time was you yourself. It means you leapt back in time and returned to the past. Really? It's not that unusual. It happens to a lot of girls around your age. No way. No way. That never happens. It happened to me. What? Are you serious? Like, say you sleep in on a Sunday. And you think, "I really don't want to do anything today. " Right? And before you know it, it's evening. It's quite a shock. You wonder what happened to your precious Sunday. I'm talking to you seriously, so I wish you'd listen seriously. It's a good thing you're alive. How about cheering up a bit? Hey... Yeah? - Think you can help me? - All right. Show me how you did it. I can't do that! I'm sure if you get the hang of it, you could do it again. I'm telling you it's not possible! But you did actually fly through the air, right, Makoto? - Like this? - Yes. Tear that part off. What was that? An earthquake? Huh? No, Sis! You mustn't! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! - It's all my fault! - What? What's your motive? Was it because I ate your pudding? M- Motive? I don't want you to die, Sis! I won't die! - Where are you going? - To the convenience store! If you want pudding, I'll go get it for you. Never mind that. - Are you mad at me? - I'm not mad at you. - You sure you're not mad at me? - I'm not, I'm not. Here goes! - There! - Whoa! That was awesome! There's no way. How could you leap back in time? There's no way you can jump back in time. No way. At least it's not something I can do. Left! Right! Left! Right! Left! Right! Go! Ow! Ow! Ow...! Where am I? Where... Oh, I'm home. Please eat by July 12 Please eat by July 12 Pudding... Please eat by July 12 My pudding's here. Which means... It's Tuesday, July 12. Today is the anniversary of when standard time was adopted in Japan. Back in 1886... There's that pudding. - I can eat it? - Isn't it your sister's? I'm sure she'll be having a bite out with Kousuke and them. I can have it then? Yay! No way! This is mine! Huh? Makoto? You're home? That hurt... The pudding! Where's the pudding?! It's gone. - Did you just see that? - You bet I did. - Huh? What'd you mean? - That girl just did an amazing jump. She did. And she disappeared for a second, right? - What?! - Why would she disappear? - Here we go again with your lies. - It's not a lie. I saw it. Did I actually just leap? Delicious! This is... This is... ...not a dream. I can leap. I can leap through time! I'm off! See ya later! See ya. - Huh? What time is it? - Why? So, as to why today, July 13, is a "Nice Day"... G'morning! - G'morning! - Huh? - Good morning! - Huh? G'morning. G'morning! Huh? Once again, in the nick of time. It'd be more refreshing if you'd just come late. You're early, Kousuke. - Did you jerk off properly this morning? - Stop joking around... ...and try getting up earlier. What?! Why are you so early this morning? Huh? - Hm? - Ooh! I'm all done! Huh? Takase... - Huh? - Can we switch groups? Sure, but... Why? Ow! Ow! Ow! - It's a fire! - Don't panic! Shut off the gas! - Takase, use the fire extinguisher! - Uh, yeah! You idiot, Takase! You're gonna pay! S- Sorry! About Chiaki... I've got other things on my mind right now. Huh? There! What the...? A- Are you all right? Makoto, have you decided... ...on whether you're going with liberal arts or sciences? - I think I might study abroad. - What?! What's that all of a sudden? You know, like an exchange program. What are you talking about? You failed Level 3 English. Oh, come on. Time waits for no one. Hey, Makoto! Coming! A melon soda and two colas. Why are we doing karaoke instead of playing baseball? We can play baseball after karaoke. What kind of jam-packed schedule is this? I don't want any part in this. Time waits for no one. Time waits for no one. Time waits for no one. - Hello? - Your time is up in five minutes. - Oh, we'll be leaving then. - Time? A melon soda and two colas. Why are we doing karaoke instead of playing baseball? Ow! What're you doing, Makoto? Nothing! I mean, I just fell. How could you fall like that?! I mean, you were just sitting right here... Who cares?! I'm gonna keep singing! Time waits for no one. Time waits for no one. Time waits for no one... - Hello? - Your time is up in five minutes. - Oh, then... - Oh, then we'll be going home... Not! Ow! What're you doing, Makoto? I just fell. How could you fall like that?! I mean, you were just sitting right here... I'm going to keep singing! I'll do a hundred songs! Uh, excuse me. We'll have a melon soda, a cola, and a ginger ale. I'm home... - What's with that voice? - Singing karaoke. How long were you singing for it to get like that? About ten hours. Don't be silly. I'm exhausted. - What's for dinner? - Chicken and veggie stew. What?! Why don't we do teppanyaki or something? We had that two days ago. - Aww, I want teppanyaki... - You're complaining a lot. You could've come home earlier and helped out. Ha! - W-What's the matter? - Huh? Uh, nothing. Wow! This is it! Thank you so much! There! Yes! Why are you only catching mine?! - Damn! Damn! - I'm amazed she can catch like that. Wham! There! Yeah! Not again! How are you able to read my pitches?! There's nothing you can hide from me! There's nothing I can't see through! I'll beat anyone, every time! What's she yelling about? Pastries from A Tes Souhaits. You've gone all out. Don't worry about it. It's my way of saying thanks for all the advice. Even if I spend all my allowance money... ...all I have to do is go back to my allowance day! Then I get all the money back! I can leap around any way I want! I can sleep in and keep hitting the snooze button. I never have to go back for things I forgot. And all-you-can-eat deals don't end in 90 minutes anymore! Oh, and if you forget to tape a show or something... ...just ask me and I'll do it. - Thank goodness. - Why? It doesn't seem like you're using your skill for anything big. What are you talking about?! I mean, this time leaping is the best! I can't get enough of it! Everyday is just so much fun! I just can't stop laughing! Maybe there's someone out there... ...who's having a rough time because of your good times? What? You think there is? Who knows? This is good. There can't be! And besides, everything'll be alright. I mean, I can always go back. I can reset things as many times as I want. Look at this! This is perfect! You'll have to wait a year if you miss this chance. You were going to tell him today, right? - Yeah. - You've got to give it a good crack. Crack it and then what? Sempai! - Me? - No! Um... Well... Kaho! Yeah. We'll go ahead! All right! - What's with those girls? - Let's just get going. Enough with that girly throw. Put your shoulder into it. Hey. You're late! Sorry. So, uh... Those girls? Just juniors from the Volunteer Club. Right. What'd they want? They wanted to know if I was going out with you. What?! We're not going out, right? - That's what I told them. - And? Anything else? I don't know why, but... ...she asked me out. - Way to go! - Are you serious? - So, what'd you say? - Said I can't go out with her. What?! You're so mean! Take it easy. - It took guts to ask you out! - Why'd you say no?! I'd definitely go out with her! I mean, come on... But she looks like that girl you liked in junior high. No, she doesn't! Don't come crying if you change your mind... ...and it's too late. You can drop the subject now. See ya. Yeah. Hey, where's your bike? - Something happened to it. - Get on the back then. You're going to take me home? Lucky me! You really think he wasn't interested? If Kousuke says he's not, then he's not. - I'm a bit relieved. - Why? If he gets a girlfriend, he'd treat her good, right? He's that kind of guy. Then we won't be able to play baseball anymore. I guess tossing the ball around wouldn't count as baseball. I don't know. I thought maybe the three of us would always be together. Kousuke would tell us off for being late... ...and you would tease me for not being able to catch the ball... Makoto... Hm? How about you go out with me? Stop the bike. Stop for a second. - What was that? - Huh? - What you just said. - You want to go out? How did we get to talking about that? You were talking about what if Kousuke got a girlfriend. I'm not that ugly, am I? Serious? Serious. W- W-Wait a minute! What is it now? Huh? Makoto? Ow! Huh? What the hell are you doing?! Nothing. Don't come crying if you change your mind... ...and it's too late. You can drop the subject now. See ya. Yeah. Hey, where's your bike? Get on the back. How dare Kousuke beat me to it. It's not like he's found himself a girlfriend. That's what he says now... ...but I bet if he got one, he'd pick her over us. - You can't be sure. - Damn. Without Kousuke, we'd only be able to toss the ball. You can think about that... ...when he gets a girlfriend. Well, I guess if he gets one, then that's that. So then Makoto... ...how about you go out with me? - Like I said, why are we talking about this?! That's what he says now... ...but I bet if he got one, he'd pick her over us. H- Hey, you know what? My sister's a total idiot! Huh? I was just talking about Kousuke. Let's talk about my sister. If Kousuke finds himself a girlfriend... You know, my sister...! You want to go out with me?! Don't come crying if you change your mind... ...and it's too late. You can drop the subject now. Huh? Makoto? - Get on the back. - No thanks. Hey, what's the matter all of a sudden? What's up with her? - It's your fault! - How so?! I always thought you liked Chiaki. Didn't you say you had to stick by him... ...so he'd stay out of trouble? - I might've said that before. Why pretend he never asked? Just go out with him. - No way! No way! No way! - Why not? I can't imagine Chiaki being more than just a friend. If it doesn't work out... ...just go back in time. - I'm sure you can do that. - I don't need to go through with that. Sometimes you can fall in love with someone who says they love you. It won't happen! Never! I see. So you're pretending it never happened. Poor Chiaki. And after he got the courage to tell you how he felt. But I suppose he doesn't even realize that he did. Chiaki came to our school this spring, right? Yeah. I heard he's been transferring schools a lot. Apparently. Are the rumors true about him returning from abroad? I doubt it. He's not too bright, for one. - Not true, huh? - Not true. I wonder if something happened to him at his last school? - Why don't you ask him? - 'Cuz, I don't have his email. You're in the same class. But you're really good friends with him. But I wouldn't ask him something like that. - And I wouldn't say we're good friends. - That's a lie. It's not a lie. I mean... Stop it! - I can't stop it! - It's all your fault! - They're getting back at him! - Stop it, you guys! Look, he's turning his ass towards us! - Who shut it off? - Huh? Huh? It's Mamiya. Are you about done? - Next time, Takase. - See ya. That's pretty bad. You're totally soaked. Are you all right, Takase? They threw cola on me yesterday. But I did manage to throw a latte back. They came after you because of that. Right? Hey, Makoto! Did you watch the night game last night? That Saito sure put the squeeze on. Hm? - Did you just look away? - No, I didn't. What are you up to? Nothing. What's going on? Tell me. What's up your sleeve? I said, nothing! Huh? What's the matter? Konno, you...! Why'd you ask me to fry the tempura? Uh, well, I didn't think that would happen! This is all your fault, idiot! What?! Who're you calling an idiot?! Keep it up and I'll throw this! Hey. Come on! Fine! Throw it! Sorry. Didn't mean to. You idiot! That guy's pretty rude. He's calling everyone an idiot. You're always calling me an idiot. Yeah, but I say it out of love. Where's your come back? You're leaving me hanging. Isn't she a little off today? Don't you think so, Hayakawa? Oh, uh... yes, indeed. - What's with the polite talk? - Well, we haven't spoken much before. Makoto! She's not here. Why isn't she here? - Did something happen? - Huh? No! Nothing! I bet you said something that pissed her off. Don't say she's got big feet. - She's self-conscious about that. - I said, there was nothing! Nothing! At least I don't think so... Whoa...! Toss it back! I can't throw while I'm thinking. I don't know... I just don't get it. Oh, it's just Yuri. Mailbox: Something great happened today! What should I do?! Oh, it's just Yuri. Mailbox: Something great happened today! What should I do?! "Something great happened today!" "Something great happened today!" Something great? Mail Reply - Text: Well?! What?! Tell me! Mail Reply - Mail sent. Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah. Hang on. Yeah... Yeah... I wonder what it was? Hurry, let's go! They're going to sell out! Umm, I'm not feeling very good today. What?! You want to go to the nurse's office? Oh! Uh, I'm fine. I'll be okay. - Let's hurry! This is something to see! - What is it? - This way, this way! - What's going on? Stop it, Takase! You're the ones that didn't stop when I asked you to! All right! We were wrong! Then why'd you do it in the first place? - That guy's lost it. - Did someone call a teacher? Hey, check this out! Stop that, Takase! Takase! Konno! Did you just order me?! N- No, I didn't! You did, too! Huh?! What?! W- Why?! Damn! Damn! D-Damn! - Hey! Stop it! - Enough! - Takase! - S-Stop... Watch out! Takase! Chiaki! Chiaki! - Are you okay? - Yuri! - I heard that hit her big time! - What year is she? Hurry, call a teacher! I- It wasn't my fault! It wasn't my fault...! - Yuri! Yuri! - Are you okay? Yuri! Don't cry. It's not that bad. What if it leaves a scar? If that happens, I'll deal with it somehow. Deal with it somehow? I'll deal with it somehow. No boys allowed. Does it hurt? Yeah. - Let's see. - No. Come on. Thanks. I'm sorry, seriously! Huh?! But, why?! I said I'm really sorry. Man, who takes a girl to a night game on their first date? I thought the three of us were going! I was looking forward to it! Look, I feel bad about it, all right? Hayakawa said a night game would be fine. So, are you gonna go out with her? - Of course. - What?! Ow! You all right, Makoto? - Are you serious? - You're saying I can't? Well, what can I say? Yuri gets my tastes. You know what I mean? Well, good for you! Hey! Idiot! Where are you throwing the ball?! I'm home! - Huh? Where's the rice? - I'm making some more. - Why? - Sis ate it all. Aww! What's with that guy? After telling me he liked me! I almost drowned! Huh? Huh? Hm? What is this? Ninety? Makoto! Ow! Let go! I think we lost this one. She's pulled one over on us, that's for sure. The world is full of deceit. I guess with just the two of us, we can only toss the ball. Let's drag Chiaki with us tomorrow. That's not fair to Yuri. If I tell him that you're feeling lonely, I bet he'd come. But I'm not lonely. Didn't Chiaki go with Hayakawa because you turned him down? I didn't turn him down! Really? What's that supposed to mean?! Oh, boy... What about you? Why don't you get a girlfriend? If I got a girlfriend... ...then you'd end up alone. I thought you fancied Kousuke. Isn't it always Kousuke that helps you when you're having problems? Kousuke's always there for anyone. Why don't you go out with him? - Why would you suggest that? - Like I said before... ...if it doesn't work out, you can always go back to what it was. I would never do that. Why not? Toying with people's feelings... Can't do such a terrible thing? Huh? Since you've been able to go back into the past... ...you haven't held back with your games. What? Is that how you see it? I suppose. She's a witch. Yup, she's definitely "Auntie Witch". Hey, this painting... Recognize it? Yeah. It's the one you've been restoring. It's a strange painting. The longer you look at it, the more relaxed and comforted you feel. Yeah. We don't know who the painter is... ...and we still don't really know whether it has any artistic merit. But there's one thing I did learn while working on its restoration. This work was painted... ...during a historical period of famine and war many centuries ago. What? I wonder how someone was able to paint such a thing... ...while it seemed the world was ending. What're you going to do, Konno? You're the only one that hasn't submitted a chosen academic track. Konno... Hm? Konno... - Konno! - Yes! Don't get cocky because you did well on the... ...practice college entrance exam. Yes, sir! That's weird... I swear it said "90" last time. I know. Why not ask her ourselves? Oh, but... - What? - W-Wait! W- Whoa! What's this about?! Miss Konno! We are members of the Volunteer Club! And there's something we'd like to ask you directly! I- It's nothing! - We've noticed lately that... - H-Hang on... - You're always with Kousuke! - W-Wait! - I guess... - Stop this! Does this mean that you're going out with him?! Are you going out with him? Are you going out with him?! I was still in junior high at the time... ...but apparently, the Volunteer Club of Kuranose Senior High... ...once visited the old age home that my grandmother was at. My grandmother was particularly impressed with one of the... ...students and she had spoken to me about him many times. She would go on about what a kind and gentle boy he was. She said it over and over. Since she had talked so much about him... ...I kind of began to fall in love with him... ...even though I'd never even met him. - That's a cute story. I found out when I got into senior high... ...that the student was Kousuke Tsuda. Wow, things like that really happen. But as you can see, this girl is a total shrinking violet. We worked so hard to pump her up. And we finally got her to declare her feelings to him. Oh, the other day... But according to Kousuke... Huh? Hm? "I already have a girl that I've given my heart to!" "So I'm sorry. I can't go out with you!" Um, but... wait... - But that's not how it went. - Huh? "How could an idiot like that get a higher mark than me?" "I can't be slacking off anymore, so... " And so he apologized. Could that "idiot" he's referring to, be me? - And that's when Kousuke... - Huh?! ...said he wasn't going out with you! But what has been going on lately?! Something just doesn't seem right! Please explain properly! H- Hang on a minute! O- Okay! All right! Ahem! I'll deal with this somehow. Somehow? What do you mean, somehow? I'll deal with it somehow! Ow! - What the...?! - What happened? Um... Well... Kaho! Yeah. Um... Kousuke! Huh? What? Didn't you just head off to the baseball field?! Never mind that! This girl's grandmother says she's so grateful that you came around... ...and took care of her at the old age home. I'm impressed, Kousuke! And, you see... H- How do you know my grandmother?! How? Um, I met her at the bowling alley... My grandmother's bedridden! Oh! That's not it...! Let me know when you're done talking. Uh, w-wait, Kousuke! What the...?! One more time! Ow! Um... Well... Kousuke! Huh? Here we go... - What? Didn't you just head off...?! - Hold it! You're being very cowardly about this! Don't sulk about me getting a better mark! This has nothing to do with that! What's up with you, showing up out of nowhere and bragging?! And this has nothing to do with what?! I'm saying that my test score should have nothing to do with... ...Kaho being in love with you! - Th-That's not true! - What?! That's not true! - W-Wait! Kaho! - Kaho! - She says it's not true. - Uh! Hang on, Kousuke! What the...?! I've got to take a more basic approach to this. Why all the ruckus so early in the morning, sis? I went back too far! And I'm late, to boot! Aww! Makoto! The peaches! The peaches! Huh? Oh, boy... And for the headlock! Ha! Huh? What was that? Amazing... - Don't look. Just carry on! - Huh? You guys need to move! Year 1 Class 2 Year 1 Class 2 Kaho! Huh? I don't exactly know why... ...but she wants you to come down to the courtyard. Who does? Where are we going?! What're you going to make me do?! - You'll know when we get there! - Makoto! Later! Okay! Okay! You got me! Is this what she meant by "come to the courtyard"? Who knows? - Go there! - Uh, wha...? That was close! Ow, ow...! What the hell are you guys doing?! - You're hurting me. - Huh? Ah! Oh, no! - Can you get up? - Yeah. Oh! - You might've sprained it. - Oh, I'm fine. It's okay. - It's not okay! - K-Kousuke! - Put your hand over my shoulder. - I-I'm sorry... - What do you think of this development? - This could be... This could be something! All right! I sure feel like I did something good! Oh, what a happy feeling this is! Hm? It's changed again! Ten? What does "10" mean? Hm? One? No one's here. Maybe I'm too early. There he is... Um, excuse me! I have a question for you! Yuri! I was wondering who it was. Why...? I brought the notebooks up for you. I think you forgot you had duties today. Oh! That's right! I figured as much. I hope you appreciate our friendship here. So, what's your question? Oh, uh, it's nothing! Fine. - Hey, Yuri... - Hm? Did you see anyone on your way up here? Like who? Uh, never mind. All right. Mailbox: I think I was just asked out. I bet you're envious! Mailbox: I think I was just asked out. I bet you're envious! From Kousuke... "I think I was just asked out. " Mailbox: I'm borrowing your bike. - Tsuda Huh? Oh, please... Who do you think set it up for you? I'm borrowing your bike. - Tsuda Don't tell me... Ma... Ko... To... There. Where do you live? In the south district, on the other side of the station. We should probably go by the hospital. - What? - My place is close by. Makoto, come to think of it... I passed by a guy on my way here... It was Chiaki. Kousuke! He went home. Holding hands with that first year girl. It's gone! Hey, Kousuke! Yeah, it's me. Hey, Dad, I've got a sprain. Think you can fix it? Oh, it's not me. Yeah, right away. I'm sorry. Please leave a message after the beep. Damn! What should I do? Should I go back in time? But it's not like anything's happened yet. Huh? Hm? Uh, um... Was there a bike accident here? No. I don't think so. Thank you. An accident, she says. How scary. Kousuke? Where are you now? Kousuke? Chiaki. Kousuke's over at his place. You guys didn't show up at the field! - Sorry. - I'll be waiting. - Hey, you know... - Huh? I've been wanting to ask you something for a while now. Do you have fun playing baseball with me? - What're you talking about? - I like playing baseball with you. For someone who likes baseball, you sure don't improve much. Well, all you've got is enthusiasm. Better than having none. What are you laughing about? It feels like I'm talking to you for the first time in a while. What're you talking about? We've been talking all day. Oh, right. I guess. - You miss me that much? - W-What're you talking about, stupid?! Just kidding! Come on! Actually, there's something I wanted to ask you as well. What's that? It's a really stupid question. Well, what is it? - Well... - Come on. Spit it out. Have you been time leaping? You've been time leaping, haven't you? Hey, Makoto... Makoto! Actually, there's something I wanted to ask you as well. It's a really stupid question. - Well... - H-Hang on a second! - Huh? - Let's talk about my little sister. - Huh? Why? - You see, my sister is really stupid...! Hold on, I was about to... Never mind. I'll be waiting then. How does Chiaki know...? Hm? Z ero? So these numbers did represent the number of times... ...I could time leap. I sure wasted my last one on something lame. Oh, well. I guess it's okay, seeing that Kousuke's all right. Hey, Makoto! I need to borrow this a bit longer! Wait, Kousuke! Kousu...! Hey! Watch where you're going! Apologize now! Hey! Look! Stop, Kousuke! Kousuke! Kousuke! Stop! Kousuke! Kousuke! Kousuke! Kousuke! Ah! H- Hey! Is she all right? - She's really badly injured! - Call an ambulance! How did she end up like this? Can she move? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Huh? What? Huh?! W- What's going on? I knew it was you. Chiaki! What are you doing here? Where's Kousuke? - Probably still at home. - What? But he was just here... Did you do this?! You can time leap too, Chiaki?! Would you laugh at me if I said I come from the future? In my time... ...a device is developed which allows one to freely travel in time. This is it here. You use it to charge your body. I was able to come to this era thanks to this. But without me realizing it, I had lost it somewhere along the way. I panicked. I looked everywhere and I eventually found it. In the science lab. Although it was already all used up. But I'm relieved it was charged to an idiot. I had trouble sleeping with fear that it'd be used for something evil. W- Why? Just because... Just because? Because there was a painting that I desperately wanted to see. No matter how far it was... ...and whatever sort of place it was at. "White Plum and Two Camellias" This painting is temporarily unavailable for display due to restoration. Tokyo Metropolitan Museum No matter how dangerous... "White Plum and Two Camellias" This painting is temporarily unavailable for display due to restoration. Tokyo Metropolitan Museum It was a painting I had to see. By my time, it had already been destroyed. And before these times, its whereabouts were unknown. The only place where there was an accurate record of it... ...was in this present time, in this place, in this season. You would be satisfied just to see it? All I needed was to see it. I was never going to forget it for the rest of my life. But I guess there's no point to it now. To anything. Huh? You can't go back?! What do you mean by that?! Like I said, I can't go back to my time. So, why is that?! When I went to steal away your bike that Kousuke was supposed to be... ...riding, the amount that had been charged up in me was used up. W- What're you going to do?! I'm not doing anything. Why would you use it up?! Didn't you think to save it?! I did save it. You may not know this... ...but Kousuke and that girl did die once at that crossing. A certain someone I know was sobbing and blaming herself for it... ...so this was the only thing I could do. I was supposed to go home, but it turned into summer before I knew it. Being with you guys was just too much fun. I saw a river flow across the land for the first time. I rode a bike for the first time. I learned for the first time that the sky was so big. But more than anything... ...I'd never seen any place with so many people. Hey, Chiaki? Could it be that there's some kind of connection... ...between that painting and the future you come from? Please, tell me. I like this era. There's baseball as well. Huh? Baseball's going to disappear?! Where are you looking, idiot. Aww, stop messing around. That painting... Huh? - That painting...! - Yeah? You'll be able to see it soon. They're just restoring it right now. How about the three of us go? With Kousuke as well? I mean, summer vacation's about to start! Huh, Chiaki? Chiaki? Sorry, but I can't. Huh? I'm going to disappear tomorrow. W- Why?! I'm not supposed to let people who live in the past... ...know about time leaps. I broke that rule. That's why... ...I won't be able to see you again. I'll keep my mouth shut! I won't tell anyone! Chiaki! Where are you?! Hey, Chiaki... Chiaki... Chiaki... You said we'd go to a night game together! Sorry. And you said we'd go to a fireworks festival! I'm really sorry. You don't want to see me in a yukata?! Is that it?! Sorry, I would've liked to have seen that. You idiot! Chiaki! Chiaki! - Chiaki! - Whoa! Wait a sec! Chiaki! Why is Chiaki quitting school? Apparently he was in debt and the mob was after him. Is that true? You sure his parents aren't divorcing? I heard he's marrying an older woman. He got her pregnant. What?! No way! So what's the story, Makoto? He's not that kind of guy! Apparently, he lost it and stabbed the guy. I heard he beat him to a pulp with a baseball bat. - Or stabbed him with a knife. - I said he's not like that! - Hey, Kousuke! - Kousuke! What the hell's going on? It's one thing to not tell me... ...but to think he'd go without saying a word to you... He did have a thing for you, after all. Did Chiaki say that? It was obvious. You didn't notice? Well, you're awkward about stuff like that. So maybe that's why he couldn't come out with it. Kousuke... Huh? - I'm a truly horrible person. - What? He wanted to tell me something... ...but I pretended it never happened. Why didn't I take what he said more seriously? Makoto, what are you talking about? H- Hey! Have you calmed down? You know, I honestly thought you were just friends with both... ...Kousuke and Chiaki. I figured you would graduate without dating either one of them... ...and you'd end up with someone else entirely. That's what I thought too, until yesterday. But that's not how it is, is it? I fell in love for the first time when I was in senior high. We hit it off right from the start. It was as if we'd known each other since we were kids. But it fell apart before we became adults. Why? Bad timing, I guess. What is he doing now? I wonder what he's up to. He promised to come back for me. I wasn't intending to wait for him, but so much time has passed. It didn't seem long. Time flew by quickly. But Makoto... You're not like me, are you? If a guy is late meeting up with you... ...you're the type to go run and look for him, right? Makoto! Have some watermelon! Come on, Dear. What's up with her? She didn't have dinner. And now, no watermelon? - She's heartbroken. - You're kidding?! Miyuki, it's none of your business. If a guy is late meeting up with you... ...you're the type to go run and look for him, right? Why?! It's supposed to be at zero. It can't be...! - Makoto! - Sis! Don't do anything rash, Makoto! Makoto! That moment, because Chiaki turned back time... Walking home from school, I joked around That moment, because Chiaki turned back time... Walking home from school, I joked around Then it should be the same for him... Walking home from school, I joked around Oh, Mako! Oh, Mako! I made you angry for no good reason Oh, Mako! I made you angry for no good reason I made you angry for no good reason Even Chiaki...! I made you angry for no good reason I wanted to see all of your expressions I wanted to see all of your expressions Go! Go! Your wide eyes and tear-filled voice Even now, they make my heart ache Weaving through the passing strangers I ran after you Now, settle down. Quiet! Seeking something that wouldn't change Seeking something that wouldn't change Huh? Who are you? Seeking something that wouldn't change - I'm Tsuda. This is Konno... your new classmate Chiaki Mamiya. Seeking something that wouldn't change Konno? Konno? I won't forget how you looked that day Konno? I won't forget how you looked that day - Makoto! - He looks a bit rough... I won't forget how you looked that day - Come over here!... but I hope you all get along. I won't forget how you looked that day See ya, Makoto! See ya, Makoto! Some feelings are more powerful than time See ya, Makoto! Some feelings are more powerful than time Some feelings are more powerful than time Hey, did you hear that? Some feelings are more powerful than time Some feelings are more powerful than time He called you by your first name. Some feelings are more powerful than time I want to be with you right now Makoto, how about you go out with me? You were talking about what if Kousuke got a girlfriend. I'm not that ugly, am I? Huh? Makoto? Are you okay? I wonder what Chiaki does on the weekends and stuff? It's not like he can play baseball all day, right? Yuri... Huh? There's something I haven't been able to tell you. What is it? I really like Chiaki. Sorry. Right. That's what I thought. I bumped into Chiaki on my way here. Go see him. Okay. Makoto. Time waits for no one... Makoto! Kousuke, where's Chiaki? He got tired of waiting and went ahead to the field. He was pretty irritable. We'd better hurry. You sure you want to leave your girlfriend alone? I did work hard to... Girlfriend? Whose girlfriend? Oh, right. It's all gone back... What are you talking about? Uh, well... Oh! Huh? - Oh no! He saw us! - He noticed us! Hey, why don't we invite them to join us for baseball? - Huh?! - Go and ask them. Why? The more people we have, the more fun it is. Hey, do you even know them? Kind of. And another thing... Huh? If you use my bicycle, it'll cost you 5,000 yen. Huh?! Got that? 5,000 yen! Hey! What's this about?! Ask them nicely, "Would you like to play baseball with us?" Like that. - Oh, one more thing! - Huh? I appreciate you waiting for me! Makoto! What?! Watch where you're going! Sure! You're late. Where's Kousuke? - He's not coming. - Huh? What do you mean he's not coming? Where'd you find that? I mean, do you even know what it is? I do. - Who told you? - You did. I didn't tell you. I would never tell you. You told me everything. About the future you live in, and what this is... Everything. H- Hey... Just as I thought. Thank goodness. Where did you come from? The future. - Can you leap? - Not anymore. Did I tell you all that? Yup. - And you believed me? - Yup. - You're an idiot. - Maybe. And you came back to tell me that? Yeah. Why did I tell you? I'm such an idiot! That painting. Go back to the future and enjoy it. It's not going to get lost or burned anymore. I'll do my best to make sure it's there for you in your era. Sure, I'd appreciate that. I was supposed to go back, but before I knew it, it was summer. I was just having too much fun with you guys. That's not how you put it. Then what did I say? Hm? I'm not telling. Why not? Come on. What did I say? I'm not telling. You have to tell me. I have to know now. Come on! Hey, look at the lovers. Look at the lovers. - Well, are we in love or what? - Look at the lovers. Get lost, you idiots! - Let's get out of here! - Hurry! Give my regards to Kousuke. Tell him I'm sorry I couldn't say good-bye to him. Sure. Oh, and... Makoto? What? There's something I've been meaning to tell you. Just don't... Just don't get yourself hurt by jumping out in front of things. Huh?! I mean, you really need to be more careful. Be more observant. Think about what you're doing before you act. Yeah. What's that? That's the last thing you have to say to me? You idiot, I'm just worried about you. Fine, then! Thank you so much for worrying about me! Now, just go already! What are you upset about?! Just go! See ya. See ya! I wonder why... I'll be waiting for you in the future. Okay. I'll be right there, I'll come running. Makoto... Makoto...! Hey, Makoto! What's going on? It's one thing not to tell me... ...but nothing to you either? All of a sudden he's dropping out... ...so he can study abroad? Give me a break! Oh! Sorry! Don't worry about it, Kaho. He probably found something he wanted to do. Did he tell you something? Nothing, really. - There! - Whoa! - Sorry! - Kaho, your arm's too weak... Oh, boy... I've also decided on what I'm going to do. Really? What? It's a secret! Huh? What's that about? Maybe some other time. Miss Konno! Hey! There! Good throw! Here it comes! There! The Girl Who Leapt Through Time As you ran around the baseball field You seemed freer than the clouds in the sky Even your blocky writing in your notebook Seemed like a light that lit everything I didn't understand the emotion of love This moment in time that will never return Taught me the true meaning of love I'm going to burn into my heart the memories of days I spent with you So I never have to remember them Even if I someday fall in love with someone else You will always be special and precious And this season will come around again The fact that I met you in the vastness of time Has made me stronger than anything else Running towards tomorrow in a daze and I just so happen to get there You will always be special and precious And this season will come once more That summer you promised me that you'd never forget Time has passed, and only now my tears begin to flow I'm going to burn into my heart the memories of days I spent with you So I never have to remember them Even if I someday fall in love with someone else You will always be special and precious And this season will come around again
