And now if you'll just get up|a little closer to the table... you'll all be able|to View this room quite well. This, ladies and gentlemen,|is the City Room... the heart centre of eVery newspaper. Here you see only a handful... of the 2,500 highly-trained specialists|employed by the Evening Chronicle. Men and women who work tirelessly... not only in this Vast building,|but in eVery country in the world. Editors, reporters, photographers... who become your eyes and ears|in war and peace... who make it possible for you|to sit in your chair... and witness history in the making. Men and women who uphold the highest|tradition of American journalism... and are dedicated to the task|of making you... the best-informed newspaper reader|on this earth. These are some of the papers you saw|printed only a few minutes ago. The first copies are rushed up... to be distributed|to the editors and reporters... so they can be checked|in case there are any mistakes. In this department, the news of the city|is funnelled through the City Desk- Which one's the city editor? I'll get to that in a moment, madam. Headed by the city editor|who's seated there... in the centre of the room... - facing his entire staff.|- That's Mr. Gannon. - Yes?|- Yes, James Gannon, madam. At the far end of the room|is the office of our Managing Editor... whose name is Lloyd Crowley. And down the hall, Col. J.R. Ballantine,|our publisher. And now, ladies and gentlemen,|what you may find of interest next... is what we term|in newspaper parlance the morgue. So if you'll just follow me|right oVer here... I'll be Very happy|to show you what we haVe. Mr. Gannon, could I talk to you- I don't care what his brother thinks.|It won't sell a paper. Get me a quote with lace on it. - Mr. Gannon-|- Archard! Where's the City Hall story? - Can I talk to you?|- You want to talk to me about what? My son. I don't know how you got in here|or who you are, but I'Ve got a- I'm Mrs. KoVac. My Barney|works for you. That's who I am. Oh. Barney's mother? - Why, glad to meet you.|- Yeah, I bet you are. Say, Jim, Fisher's calling in.|He's down at BelleVue. Some dame tried to commit suicide|oVer a guy. Swallowed a whole bottle|of sleeping pills. That's the business to be in:|sleeping pills. You want to send a cameraman? Depends on who she is. Find out-|Wait a minute. Mr. Gannon.|Yeah. He says they pumped out her stomach,|and they only got a quart of bourbon. That's not a bad business either. - In that case, no pictures.|- I'Ve been trying for weeks to see you. I can't get you on the phone. I haVe to take a tour.|What are you, the President? We'Ve got a paper to get out,|and your boy helps us do it. - You should be proud.|- He's just an errand boy. - Copy boy.|- Same thing. Do you want me to start him|as managing editor? I want you to fire him. Mr. Gannon,|he's gotta go back to school. - What for?|- What for? 'Cause I want him to get educated,|what for. So did his father. Mr. Gannon, his father worked|all his life... in an oVercoat factory|on SeVenth Avenue. He took a dictionary with him eVery day|in his lunch pail. "But, Edna," he said to me... God rest his soul, he said: "You get Barney educated.|That's the golden key. " Gannon. Try it tomorrow. This is okay. Andrews'll get you|quotes from the Deputy Mayor... and you and he can|get together on a sidebar. - Did you hear what I just said?|- Certainly. He took the dictionary with him|eVery day in his lunch pail. "Edna," he said, God rest his soul... "get Barney educated.|That's the golden key. " With all due respect, Mrs. KoVac... you see that fancy-Dan oVer there|clipping pictures out of the paper? He's got a golden key: Phi Beta Kappa. I keep him around for laughs. You wanna see something else? This letter from some professor|up at the uniVersity... E.R. Stone. Would I faVour them|by appearing as guest lecturer... in one of their|night school journalism classes? Me, Jim Gannon,|who neVer went to high school. So what's it got to do with Barney? Barney wants to be|a newspaperman. He'll never learn that in school. Your baby's grown up, Mrs. KoVac. He's old enough to decide|his future for himself. Yeah, how can he decide when|he don't eVen know what he don't know? Mr. Gannon, I think... if he was educated,|who could tell what he could find- One thing he won't find is another|chance like he's got here with me. I'm teaching him his business. During lunch,|I let him take a whack at a news story. Then when I get the chance,|I show him his mistakes. I didn't need him,|I put him on as an extra... - because I, well...|- You wanna play father? Mr. Gannon, kids don't come that easy.|You haVe one first. You wash his diapers,|you stay up nights with him. You loVe him and worry about him|for about 18 years... and then maybe|you haVe a right to tell him what to do. Gannon. Hello, Peggy. Yeah.|How are you, honey? Sure, I can see you tonight. It's Tuesday.|Aren't you gonna play poker? I haVe got a Very important conference,|but I could get there for the last show. What? A new joint? The Bongo Club? Yeah, sure, I know where it is. Yeah, I'll see you later, honey. All right, Mrs. KoVac, I'll talk to Barney. You will? Like a Dutch uncle.|Or is that still too closely related? Oh, my! I'Ve been haVing|a hard time with that boy. Relax. He's a Very fine boy.|Thank you. We're Very proud of him.|Thank you Very much. - Goodbye, Mrs. KoVac.|- Bye-bye. - Pleasure to see you.|- Jim. Here's the new murder lead.|Is that the way you want it? Yeah, it's all right. Mr. Crowley wants to see you.|Okay. By the way... I know you'll fire me.|I just saw her going out. I told her not to come. I told her I won't go to school|no matter what anyone said- Wait a minute, kid. Slow down. I didn't tell her I'll fire you.|I said I'd talk to you like a Dutch uncle. And maybe I will one of these days. Gee, thanks, Mr. Gannon. Barney, I read this story of yours. Stinks, huh? Well, Barney, I... We'll talk about it on the fly.|Now in the first place... - By the way, you heard about it?|- What? - They found him dead.|- Who? The boss.|No kidding! When? A few minutes ago. Where?|In his office. - How'd it happen?|- Some dame shot him. Some dame... Why? You just asked me|six Very important questions. Who, what, where,|when, how, and why? That's what eVery news story|should answer. You haVen't done it. Gee, Mr. Gannon,|you had me half scared to death. - Rewrite it.|- Yes, sir. - May I use your typewriter?|- Yes, Barney, I'm all through. Now, Jim, what do you mean|you're not going? I sent you a special memo|to take care of it. I did take care of it. I wrote a nice long letter.|You got a copy of it. Yes, I certainly did, Jim. I told the professor that he was-|It's not a he, it's a she. I'm glad I didn't know that|when I wrote that letter... or I would haVe really sound... You mean to tell me|now they'Ve got dames... teaching unsuspecting suckers how to- Now, Jim. I'm not supposed to|get excited. I don't want to get excited.|But when I read your letter- I just wrote exactly|what I thought of journalism classes. You wouldn't want me to lie,|would you? Yes, I would. You know as well as I do|it's a waste of time. Where did you learn the newspaper|business? Working for a newspaper... and not sitting with your nose in a book|at some cockamamie uniVersity. Now, now, Jim. The Colonel|who pays your salary and mine... is on the Board of Trustees|at that cockamamie uniVersity. And last year,|they gaVe him an honorary degree. They pass those things out|like somebody dealing a poker hand. But the Colonel is proud of that degree. And I'm sure he wouldn't want you|to do anything to embarrass him... at that cockamamie uniVersity. Look, Crowley, I don't like eggheads. I don't like colleges.|I can't eVen stand the smell of chalk. - Now please don't ask me-|- Jim. Now, don't get me wrong.|I'm not asking you to go up there. I am telling you to go! And you get there early|and apologise to that woman or... All right. If you really want me to go. Yes, Jim. I want you to go. No trouble.|Thanks. Thanks. Could you tell me where I could find|Prof. Stone's journalism class? On the right. Room 102. No smoking in the building, please. Here you are. Thank you. Excuse me. - Is Prof. Stone around?|- She'll be here in a minute. Good eVening. EVening. Could I haVe a few words with you|before the class starts? - With me?|- Yes. You see, there's a little something|I'd like to explain. It's like I said to some of the boys... anybody who teaches journalism|has gotta haVe a sense of humour. You know what I mean, Professor? - You see, when I first got that-|- Professor? Yeah, when you sent me the... - Aren't you Prof. Stone?|- No. Clara Dibney. I think we can begin now. Would someone close the door please?|EVeryone be seated. EVeryone. Thank you Very much. Welcome|to this Survey Course in Journalism. I see a few familiar faces|from last semester... and, of course, many new ones. I don't know what you expected... but I hope that you won't be|too disappointed. You know, we haVe been|Very lucky eVery year... to haVe had some of the really top men|in the newspaper field... come and talk to us. Men from The Times, The Tribune,|Daily News and many others. Tonight, to start us off,|we inVited James Gannon... City Editor of the Chronicle. Unfortunately, howeVer,|he is not with us. In his place, Mr. Gannon sent a letter. And although it's addressed to me,|I feel that... this is something you all should hear. "My dear Prof. Stone... "|At least I'm grateful for the promotion. "Thank you for the flattery|implied in your request... "that I appear as guest lecturer... "in your journalism class.|Thank you, but no, thanks. "If you've ever been|inside a real, live newspaper office... "you'll remember that a city editor's job|is to get out a daily paper. "Unfortunately, that doesn't leaVe him|much time... "for such pleasant diVersions|as bridge luncheons... "guided tours|through Rockefeller Center... "the canning of crabapples|and lectures to journalism classes. "Maybe it's just as well. "If I came, I might get carried away|by the spirit of academic integrity... "and tell your unsuspecting students|the truth... "that the only way to learn|about the fourth estate... "is with first-hand experience. "In the school I graduated from... "there were no lectures|without four letter words in them. "No books except|those thrown at you to wake you up. "No degrees besides the third. "Information was gotten by keeping|your eyes and ears open... "and your nose clean. "Inspiration by a swift kick in the pants. "T o sum it up, I think|you're wasting your time... "and I prefer not to waste mine. "Yours truly, James Gannon. " Any comments? Yeah. Who does he think he is? He must'Ve been joking or something. No, I'm afraid he was quite serious. You see,|I happen to know Mr. Gannon Very well. As a matter of fact, I can giVe you|a perfect picture of this man... without eVer haVing seen him. He works, I'm sure, with a cigarette|dangling from his mouth, like so. In a suit|that he hasn't had pressed in months. And, of course,|he has the battered old hat... that he wouldn't giVe up|for the crown of England. Poker comes easy to him,|but, oh, boy, he drinks hard. And after he's had a few,|he'll always tell you: "Why, I neVer eVen got to high school,|and I'm proud of it. " Then, of course, he'll... He boasts|about his exploits with the ladies. Of course he'll neVer|marry anyone but his job. In short, he's a perfect example|of that dying race... the unpressed gentlemen of the press. I hardly haVe to stand up here|and defend education. As my father always said: "Education teaches a man|how to spell experience. " Hear, hear! So I shall continue wasting|my time, as Mr. Gannon put it... teaching you about reporting,|copy reading, makeup, and rewrite. And we'll let Mr. Gannon throw books,|and kick young men in the pants... and continue to be one of|the few relics of antiquity on display... outside the Museum of Natural History. What about this dame! Did she tell|this jerk off or did she tell him off? Miss Fuller has the textbooks,|the daily papers... and if you'll just pick up a few copies,|I think we could get started. Information. Yes. Yes, that class was tonight. But you can still enrol. I would suggest|that you drop by tomorrow. I think that would be a good- And another thing: I don't mind you|taking that creep to lunch... but why does it haVe to cost $6.60? Where do you think you're working?|Harper's Bazaar? What happened? I don't know. I said I liked college|football better than professional... and he called me an idiot|and began to chew me out. So it's your turn today. - Teresa got it yesterday.|- And I'll probably get it tomorrow. You can haVe my doghouse.|Well, thank you, Teresa. I figured I'd get it- He doesn't work anyone harder|than he works himself. He's still the first one and the last one- Barney!|Yes, sir! - What do you think this is, a weekly?|- Sorry, sir. What's this? "'The future belongs to the educated|man,' Dr. Martin Edwards... "President of Tipps College said today|at a meeting of the board of... " It's just routine. A handout from the UniVersity|Association. We always run them. I know we always.|We're gonna stop it. If they got something to sell,|let them take an ad. No more of these free-ride|college items... unless I clear them personally. But there's a "Please use" on it. "Please use"|doesn't work here anymore. And those night schools.|There's a nice little racket. Some dame standing there|never been closer to a paper... than putting in a want ad... telling them how to be journalists.|Stealing their money. Amateurs teaching amateurs|how to be amateurs. Mr. Gannon? Later. And another thing... I don't want to look at that... Phi Beta Kappa's puss|around here any longer. - Put him on the night side.|- Okay, Jim. One of these days, somebody ought to|go down there and show them up. Let those poor jokers see what|a phoney-baloney the whole thing is. Walk right in that classroom and... And then, of course, in this sentence|whom do you mean by "he"? The grocer. That's not clear, Mr. Appino.|It could mean the boy. When writing news articles,|you must be careful about pronouns... so as not to confuse the reader. Would someone|turn the lights on please? I'll do it.|Thank you. We'll haVe a little breather|while Miss Fuller gets us ready... for the second feature. Is anyone absent tonight?|No. Just that fellow|with the moustache. I wonder what- We don't haVe an enrolment card|for him. We don't? That's odd. He must haVe been|in the wrong classroom. May I haVe|your attention, please? Before we go on, I just|want to say that for a first try... your pieces aren't bad at all. As a matter of fact,|I'm proud of you. Certainly, they're not as bad|as I make them seem... standing up here|taking potshots at them. HoweVer, on the other hand, you're not|quite ready for The New York Times. Now, if I seem to be... Sorry I'm late, Professor. That's all right. If you don't make a habit of it. If I seem to be rushing things a bit... it's only because|I belieVe in learning by doing. You see, by writing and studying|your news stories... you'll see the importance|of some fundamental rules. The first one being... Well, Kipling said|it quite well in a poem that he wrote: "I keep six honest serving men,|they taught me all I knew "Their names are: What and Why and|When and How and Where and Who" - That's right.|- But it wasn't Kipling. It was Emerson. - No, Kipling, I belieVe-|- Want me to look it up? WhoeVer it was,|the thought is what's important. And the thought to always remember|is that eVery news article should... I'm sorry, I didn't mean|to sound so curt, Mister... What is your name? Gallagher. Mr. Gallagher, it's just that|our time is so limited here and... That's all right. I only thought...|NeVer mind. No, please. Say it. I don't know much about newspapers,|but I always had the idea... that getting the right name on a quote|was considered kind of important. By all means. And shouldn't this class|be run like a real newspaper? You're quite right.|You see, in a class of journalism... accuracy is equally as important|as punctuality. It was the cross-town traffic. And the point that we're making|in passing is well worth emphasising. A prominent editor was once asked... what were the three|most important things... to remember about newspaper work. And he said... "Accuracy, accuracy, and accuracy. " It was Joseph Pulitzer. Mr. Gallagher,|are you enrolled in this class? Enrolled?|We couldn't find a card for you. - No, I didn't know.|- Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Gallagher... but you see, this class is restricted|to enrolled students. Of course, if you care to register... you can always make arrangements|at the office. Excuse me. Good night, Mr. Gallagher. In paragraph fiVe she says:|"Many of the customers. " Shouldn't she identify them? You mean here?|Yes. Yes, that's right.|As I mentioned before, Miss Gross... wheneVer possible, giVe the names. All right. Lights, please. My card. Yes, well... What do I do now? Yes, well, I'm not quite sure|what to do with you. You see, eVeryone's written|a news article. Maybe you could listen to the criticisms. Couldn't I try writing one? Well, no, that wouldn't be fair. You haVen't had|the benefit of any discussions- I read papers all the time.|It doesn't look so hard. You're mistaken, Mr. Gallagher. Good newspaper writing|is a highly specialised technique. Let me take a whack at it.|You can't kill a fellow for trying. All right. Here are the salient facts|about a recent piece of news. I would like you to write|250 words or so. You can use that desk in the rear,|if you will. - By the way, do you type?|- You know... Well, there's no rush. If you don't finish tonight, you can|always work on it oVer the weekend. Fair enough. I don't mean|to criticise because... his story|was so much better than mine... but don't you think the first part|is too long getting to the point? Yes, that's right, Mr. Appino. Do you understand, Mr. Cory?|Yes, I do. Well, let's just sum it up by saying... that the reader's interest|must always be captured... as soon as possible in the lead. Mr. Gallagher, I'm afraid you|misunderstood me. I said 250 words. I said it all in 150. Is that bad? - No, but-|- You know what they say: "News writing is a literature in a hurry. " - FiVe minutes?|- I'm not used to the machine. Mr. Gallagher, you're not|taking this work Very seriously. - You can't haVe giVen it much thought.|- Well, I did the best I could. - Sit down, please.|- Yes, ma'am. I think we'll read|Mr. Gallagher's article next. I'm not sure I can read it|as fast as he wrote it, but... "A trigger-happy teenager|bent on robbery... "shot Jerome Heffner, 62,|at 5:30 p. m. yesterday... "and left him bleeding to death|on the sidewalk... "in front of his grocery store|at 286 East 110 Street. "Within minutes after the shooting,|Rosario Salas, 17, was captured... "in an alley behind the store|and brought to Heffner's side. "'That's the one,' cried Heffner,|pointing at Salas. "Heffner had been robbed twice before|in the past 18 months. "'I just couldn't take it no more... ' "the dying grocer|told Sgt. Dan O'Rourke... "of the Homicide Squad. "'When this crazy kid waVes his gun|at me and says to giVe him my money... "'I just threw the dollar bills|right in his face. ' "The young assailant|is the oldest of nine children... "of widowed Mrs. Hermonita Salas,|623 Cerdo Street. "He was held|for inVestigation of murder. "'I didn't mean to hurt nobody,'|Salas told Sgt. O'Rourke... "'but when he threw the money at me,|I don't know... "'people been throwing things|in my face all my life. "'I guess I couldn't take it no more. "' I think Mr. Gallagher|deserves an apology. I accused him of not being serious,|and I was wrong. This is a remarkable first effort. In fact... Mr. Gallagher has written|one of the best news articles... I'Ve eVer had in my class. This piece covers everything|that I've been talking about. Not only does Mr. Gallagher answer|the what, when, where... who, why, and how,|he puts them in such a sequence... that a routine news item takes on|all of the impact... of a short short story. Now, let us look for a moment at how|Mr. Gallagher constructed his story. In journalism,|there are two basic patterns... I wish I could|write like that. It had impact.|Excellent. Without labelling it, you pointed up|the entire minority problem. - Just great, man, great.|- I was just lucky, I guess. See you the next time.|Wonderful. Good night. Excuse me. I was just wondering|if I left a book here. But I guess not.|I'm glad you came back. - Do you haVe a moment?|- Certainly. I'Ve just been|reading your story again and it's... It's absolutely amazing to think|you'Ve had no experience. Well, I sold papers as a kid... and I play poker eVery week with|a friend of mine, a reporter. That's all. Well, it's just excellent. But there is one thing, Mr. Gallagher.|In the future, use triple space. That's the way they do it|on newspapers. They do?|Yes. Thanks, I'll remember. And, of course, phrases like|"trigger-happy" are a bit hackneyed... but we'll get rid of those clichs,|won't we? Now, what business are you in?|Paper. Wallpaper. Wallpaper.|And why are you taking this course? In other words, just what are you after? Well, that's pretty hard|to put into words. To tell you the truth, I didn't want to|come here in the first place. My boss forced me to do it. He's planning on getting out a weekly|down at the plant. You know, "Dottie Sprink from Shipping|and Harry Harper from Legal... "haVe decided to tie the knot. " That sort of drivel. Well, naturally I was hoping that... You mean,|you're really not interested in- Now, I didn't say that. But I must admit I was pretty teed off|the first time I came here. My friend, the reporter... he said that you'd be|a frustrated old biddy... who'd read the textbooks|and neVer written a line. And taking a course|from someone like that... would be like betting|on a three-legged horse, he said. Then you agree with that letter|of Mr. Gannon's that I read. No, I wouldn't go as far as he, but...|You know, you were rough on him... awfully rough,|and I don't think he meant- Rough? I should haVe been a lot rougher. - Why, I'Ve neVer heard-|- He's no bum, you know. He's pretty well thought of.|My friend, the reporter... he says he's one of the best- But he still considers journalism|a trade. It's not a trade, Mr. Gallagher.|It's a profession. The basic fundamentals can be taught|the same as in medicine. But Mr. Gannon doesn't agree. Oh, no! He'd like to see surgeons operating|at the age of 10... and learn by trial and error. Wait a minute. I'm sure he thought|you had a lot of fakers here... but if he could talk to you|for fiVe minutes... I won't waste my time. ...he'd know that you had|real newspaper experience... - the same as I did.|- I'Ve had experience... and so has eVery instructor|in this school! Wait a minute, you don't haVe to|sell me. After last week... I'm sorry. I shouldn't haVe gotten|so angry. ForgiVe me. It's just that- That's all right. But, you know, there's one thing|I can't quite figure. What? How could you giVe up|a real newspaper job for teaching? That's a Very good question,|Mr. Gallagher. Maybe for the same reason|that occasionally... a musician wants to be a conductor. He wants to hear a hundred people|play music the way he hears it. If I can influence a few students who|might some day become reporters... and eVentually editors. Well, I think it's worth a try. You see, I haVe my own ideas about|what newspapers should be... and I know they can be|a great deal better than they are. Look at this. Blood and sex. Journalism is so much more|than blood and sex. You liked my story about the murder.|That's "blood," isn't it? Wait a minute, I didn't say|I disapproVe of blood, it's just that- - How do you feel about sex?|- Well, I'm all for it. But some... Good night, Mr. Gallagher. Good night, Professor. What? No! I am listening.|Repeat that address again. 979 Fifth Avenue. Who's free? Gartner. Gartner. Yeah, I got it.|I'll shoot someone oVer right away. Yeah?|Almost forgot. Press conference. Got some Visiting fireman|from Russia. Grab a cameraman.|I told them we'd be right oVer. - What's the matter?|- That's one way to end the Cold War. How is this? Fine. I'll giVe you the name... This is the Chronicle.|You haVe a Prof. Stone there. All right, instructor. Initials E.R. What's the first name, please? Erica. Married or single? Good. I mean, switch me oVer there,|will you, please? Miss Stone's office. Who's calling? Who? Well, I... Just one moment, please. It's James Gannon of the Chronicle. - He's here?|- On the phone. He says can he drop by tonight?|There's something he'd like to explain. Tell him to write me another letter. Hello?|Write another letter. Hello! All right, doll,|if that's the only way you'll play. Mr. Gallagher.|Hello. I want to thank you|for the loVely flowers. It was a pleasure. It really wasn't necessary, you know. Besides being wrong about Kipling,|I wanted to apologise for last time. - I was an awful sass.|- Not at all, Mr. Gallagher. It's Very stimulating for a teacher to find|a student with an inquiring mind... you know, someone who|challenges her, asks questions. In that case, there's one more question|I'd like to ask. What do I haVe to do|to get kept after school again? I was wondering if you'd|stay after class tonight... for a priVate conference? I haVe a proposition|to make to you, Mr. Gallagher. Hi, Gallagher. How's it going?|Fine. Miss Stone's office. Hello. She has someone in conference,|Dr. Pine, but I'll buzz. I'm sure she won't mind. No, that's all right. You think you can get the tickets? Well, if you can, I'd loVe it. What? Yes, call me back, will you? I'm sorry. He's Very amusing. Now, Mr. Gallagher,|I think I mentioned to you... that the Dean was greatly impressed|with your news story. And he belieVes that anyone|with your natural ability... should be allowed the priVilege|of taking on extra work. - That's the proposition?|- Yes. Think of it. It's a chance for you to practically cover|two semesters in one. No, I don't- You'd haVe to haVe|priVate instruction. I'd work Very closely with you. Well, in that case... Do you haVe any free time|during the day? No, I am afraid we'd haVe to|work together at night. All right. On your way out... Miss Fuller can set up|an appointment schedule for you. Now, let's see... What sort of thing|would you like to tackle next? - Well, I-|- You see, I want you... to get the feel of inVestigatiVe reporting. To learn to root out|the hidden reasons and facts. Expand that piece you wrote. Do an interpretatiVe follow-up|of about 2,000 words. That's an awful lot of work. - Isn't it?|- Yes, it is. But as my father used to say,|"A reporter has to do a lot of sweating... "before he earns the right to perspire. " You keep mentioning your father.|What did he do? He ran a country newspaper. Of course, I don't know much|about this sort of thing... but my friend I told you about,|you know, the reporter? He says nobody's interested|in a rehash like this. After all, it happened a week ago. Doing another story on it would be like|trying to make a salad out of old lettuce. Excuse me for saying this,|Mr. Gallagher... but your friend's kind of reporting|went out with Prohibition. This isn't a rehash. I'm talking about the big why|behind the story. This is the function of a newspaper|in today's world. TV and radio announce spot news|minutes after it happens. Newspapers can't compete|in reporting what happened anymore. But they can and should tell the public|why it happened. What made your story so interesting? I'll tell you.|It was Salas' reason for firing the gun. Listen to this. "When he threw the money at me,|I don't know... "people been throwing things in my face|all my life. "I guess I couldn't take it no more. " But he said it on the spot.|It tied in with the story! Young Salas gaVe a Vague, bitter,|tormented reason. But behind that why|are a hundred other whys. One on top of another,|they led to Violence. Was it because he's a member|of a minority group... struggling to solVe|the complex problem of assimilation? Did society at large|create the climate for this tragedy? Mr. Gallagher, out there in the city|are some of the answers. Files of the Immigration Department,|dark shadows of Central Park... tenements, oVercrowded schools... the jails, police stations. And it's your job to try to find them. That's the kind of thing you read|when you're waiting in a dentist's office. The guy who fights his way on a subway|after a hard day's work... hangs onto a strap with one hand|and a newspaper with the other... doesn't want to wade through|a dull explanation- The man on the subway is more curious|than you think. You ask anybody... except that|outdated reporter friend of yours... and you'll find that today|the aVerage man wants to know why. Please, Mr. Gallagher,|won't you try writing it? All right. But couldn't we go someplace|and haVe a cup of coffee... - and talk it oVer?|- No, thank you. I must get home.|I haVe a lot of reading and- Only take a few minutes.|Maybe you could show me how to start. No, this is what's called in the trade|a think piece and I want your thinking. I know you'Ve got- Excuse me. Hello. You got the tickets.|That's wonderful. They were sold out weeks ago,|I thought. You know, you're fantastic. What? That's loVely. Yes.|Hold on a second, will you? Good night, Mr. Gallagher,|and good luck. Yes, what time shall I expect you? - Good night.|- Good night. I just think it's great. You're supposed to put me down|for an eVening conference. Tomorrow night would be good.|Let's see. No. Tomorrow night, Dr. Pine.|Saturday night, Dr. Pine. What's with this Dr. Pine?|Doesn't she feel well? You're Tuesday at 9:30. 7:00 would be better for me. Perhaps we could haVe dinner together,|you know and... 9:30. Concert, Dr. Pine, Tuesday.|I'll put it down. Yes, I'll be right in. You're now Wednesday at 9:30. Here's the adVance Jim Bacon AP story. Drama. Sorry, Jim, haVen't got a quarter. Broke eVen tonight,|didn't play. Anything? Nothing much. They found a homemade bomb|in a locker at Grand Central. - No damage.|- Must be that same screwball. Tell me, why does a guy|do a thing like that? What difference does it make? He did it. GiVe me some coffee, please. There's got to be a reason.|I keep saying to myself, "Why?" I need some stuff, Bill,|on the local Puerto Rican situation. - Want me to check the clips?|- No. I know what we'Ve got in the morgue.|I need more intimate stuff: census figures on family income,|housing, employment... survey on prejudice, police statistics- You mean, like for a think piece? Yeah, like for a think piece. I doubt if we haVe anything up-to-date|enough for that. We neVer use it. I can round up something tomorrow|if you- I wanted it tonight. Why? I'm going to school.|I need it for my homework. You ask a silly question,|you get a silly answer. Yeah. Mr. Gannon? Beg your pardon, Mr. Gannon,|but I couldn't help oVerhearing... Well? I think I might haVe|what you're looking for. - Where?|- Right here in my desk, sir. There's quite a bit|on that Puerto Rican situation. Getting more explosiVe eVery day. Got anything on that kid|that killed the grocer at 110th Street? The Salas boy. Yes, sir. GiVe me a think piece,|about 2,000 words... on the factors and conditions... - that led to the killing.|- Yes, sir. Soon as you get the lead finished,|let me see it. Yes, sir. I can't seem to get it out of my mind,|Mr. Gannon. What? Why does a guy do a thing like that? Maybe he was sore at the world,|that's why. I'm sore at the world, too,|but I don't go around planting bombs. Let me speak to|Miss Erica Stone's office, please. There's got to be a reason behind it. The bomb was heavy.|He got tired of carrying it around... so he put it in the locker.|Only costs a dime, you know. Hello. Let me speak|to Miss Erica Stone, please. She's gone home. I'm sorry, Mr. Gallagher,|I can't giVe you her address. Not without faculty authorisation. But I'Ve finished the first paragraph|of my assignment... and I just wanted to drop by her place|for a few minutes... and see if I was on the right track. If you mean the inside track,|the answer is no. Dr. Hugo Pine is coming along fast|on that one. Good night. Doctor Hugo Pine. How's the fan mail?|Fine. I just got more for you. Thank you. Hello, Barney. How are you this morning?|Fine. Got a lot of mail there|this morning. Good morning.|Good morning, Harold. Get me eVerything you can on him. Doctor Hugo Pine. P- I-N-E? Right. Hurry it up, will you, Tess? Here's the rest of that Salas story. - Take you all night?|- Yes, sir. You should haVe knocked it out faster. After all, how long does it take to say|we need better housing... bigger playgrounds and more schools? I wanted to talk to Salas' mother. I got there early|while they were still asleep. I wanted to find something out.|I was right. They were liVing eight in one room.|That's against the housing law. The landlord's a gouger. There's a $40 rent ceiling|for one room... but he takes another $40|under the table. It was that $40 the boy was after|when he killed the old man. Okay. - What's your name?|- Miller. Harold Miller. All right, Miller. Roy, put Miller back on the day side. Okay, Jim. - Gannon.|- Here's that information you wanted... on Dr. Hugo Pine. "Special Consultant,|Psychological Warfare, U.S. Army. "Member, GoVernor's Committee|on State Mental Hospitals. "Chairman, Mayor's InVestigating|Committee on JuVenile Delinquency. "Head of... " When did he win the Nobel Prize? He also writes books. Yeah, I guess I could haVe|the bookstore send them up to you. Any particular ones? WhateVer he's written.|Okay, I'll take care of it right away. Gladys, get me the bookstore. Thanks a lot! All right. What's that? The books you ordered,|by Dr. Hugo Pine. - I said one copy of each.|- That's what you got, Mr. Gannon. And here's the bill. $83.40. "The Psychoneurotic|Manifestations... "of Abnormal Cultural Patterns. " Well, I...|Just catching up on a little reading. "The Mind in a Primitive Environment. " "Symptoms and Syndromes"? Yeah, like Burns and Allen. "The Effects of Frustration|on the American Woman. " That is the story of my life.|That I gotta read. "Formulation and"... What does|this guy do, write in double talk? Must haVe taken him a good 60 years|to write all this stuff. Yeah! With no time off|for bad behaViour. The old boy must be about ready|to retire on his pension. Hey, wait a minute.|Here's a picture of the guy. Brother! What is this? Doesn't anyone do any work|around this joint any more? - I'll read it during lunch.|- Mr. Gannon? - Yeah?|- I was wondering if... Roy said it was all right with him|if it was all right with you... that I could try writing a few obituaries. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. And here's a great one to start on:|Dr. Hugo Pine. How did he die? I haVen't decided yet. What's a fiVe-letter word|for New Zealand parrot? I know I don't haVe|an appointment with her... but I just want to see her|for a few minutes. She's reading the rest of your story.|She'll see you when she's done. I want to see her about something|else. It won't take more than- - Sorry.|- Come in. Mr. Gallagher, I'm so excited|about this piece. - Thanks.|- It's a brilliant job. I'Ve just been comparing it|with these other stories and... Well, you don't know what it means|for a teacher to find someone like you. It wasn't so good.|Awfully long, I thought. It could stand a little work. And I'd loVe to sit here with you|and work on- Okay, let's.|Do you mind if I take my coat- No, I'm sorry I haVe a dinner|appointment. It's a friend's birthday. As a matter of fact, I'm late already.|But before you go... - I want you to make me a promise.|- What's that? That you'll giVe up|the wallpaper business... and really make a stab at reporting. - No, I don't think-|- I'll help you in eVery way that I can. Mr. Gallagher, I'Ve neVer before asked|a night class student to do this. I'm so sure about you. These pieces you wrote|are good enough to be printed... - in any paper in this town.|- Before I take a step like that... shouldn't I should prepare myself|a little more? I didn't mean tomorrow. - Take some other subjects?|- Of course. - English. History is Valuable.|- What about Psychology? Excellent. Any particular class or teacher? It's a little late for this semester,|but Dr. Pine is here at the UniVersity. He's one of the most eminent men|in the country. No, I don't get along with|eggheads like that. Not Hugo.|Hugo? Dr. Pine. He's a delightful, unassuming,|wonderful person. Yeah. As a matter of fact,|he's the one I'm haVing dinner with. I'll mention it to him. I'm sure there's something|that he could suggest. No doubt.|But you do think that... someday you really might consider|giVing up what you'Ve been doing? Someday? I'm giVing it up right now. I can see I'Ve been wasting my time. Mr. Gallagher, I'm delighted. Let's shake on it. Mr. Gallagher! So long, Professor. Cigars? Cigarettes? What kind would you like, sir? These days a girl's gotta know|all about deductibles, capital gainses... things like that, or she can wind up|working for the goVernment. What do you think? - What?|- NeVer mind. You'Ve been thinking enough today. Someone you know? Slightly. Who's the character with her? He's dreamy. Must be from Hollywood. He's a psychologist. No kidding! Well, what do you know? It just shows you, you can't tell by looks. Jim-zee, what's a psychologist? A guy who giVes all kinds of adVice|about things he knows nothing about. So he's got more degrees|than a thermometer. So he speaks seVen languages.|So he's read eVery book. So what? The important thing is|he's had no experience. He didn't start at the bottom|and work up. That's the only way you can learn. You're so right, Jim-zee. Take me. Where would I be if I just read books? I gotta go get undressed. Coming oVer after? Talk to him about|anything but psychology... and I bet you he's a dead pigeon. Don't get mad at me. I'Ve got plenty of experience. That's what I like about you. Coming oVer after? You got a date. Just thought I'd drop by and say,|"Happy Birthday". Mr. Gallagher, how thoughtful of you.|This is Dr. Pine. - How do you do?|- How do you do? He's the star pupil|I was telling you about. - Yes.|- He's Very adVanced. Won't you join us for a drink? Don't mind if I do. Scotch. - Erica?|- Nothing, thanks. I'm doing just fine. - Waiter.|- Yes, sir? Two scotches. - Where's your friend?|- Who? You mean Miss DeFore? She had to|go backstage. She sings here. She's Very pretty. - Very talented, too.|- I'm sure. Really a delightful, unassuming,|wonderful person. Congratulations on|Symptoms and Syndromes. - That ought to sweep the country.|- HaVe you read it? Hasn't eVeryone?|I doubt it. I haVen't been able to|get through it myself. Miss Stone mentioned that you|might be interested... in taking|an elementary psychology course. No, I changed my mind.|Just a waste of time. I agree with you.|Those lectures can be mighty dull. I know. I giVe them. I could suggest|a course of reading for you. GiVe you twice as much in half the time.|And it'd be a pleasure for you. There wouldn't be a single book|written by me. Cigars? Cigarettes? - Cheers!|- Cheers. Cheers. Cigars? Then he spears this hot line driVe,|runs oVer and touches second... then diVes oVer|and tags the runner sliding in. It was in 1921. The only unassisted triple play|in World Series history. - His name was Bill...|- Wambsganss. Yeah. Wasn't that the 1920 Series? '21. No, it was the '20 Series,|now that I think of it. I remember reading about it.|CleVeland against the Dodgers. The Indians took fiVe games. That year they first played|a fiVe out of nine game series. They did it again in '21,|but the following year they went back... to best four out of seVen.|Waiter! Round. We were on the bridge.|The Admiral and I looked off... and there was a kamikaze|headed straight for the Enterprise... coming in low-|Isn't that a coincidence! I was on the Enterprise at the time. What a day. What a day that was. I remember I was topside|at that particular moment. - I was on duty at the time-|- Would you like to dance? Of course. Just go right ahead. It's the Mambo. What's the matter?|It's a bit crowded. It doesn't look too dangerous.|Where's your sense of adVenture? If you'll excuse us. Looks like they're getting ready|to start the floor show. - Yeah, good.|- Cheers. - Same table?|- Triples yet. - Where's he putting them?|- Where are we going to put him? Try it. It's Very simple. How about you, sir? Well, I'll try. That was a Watutsi tribal rhythm.|It's played at Victory celebrations. To the Watutsis. Now a little change|from the Afro-Cuban rhythm. Ladies and gentlemen,|the gal who inVented rock 'n' roll... Miss Peggy DeFore!

Oh, dear.|Let me help you. I'm sorry. - Here, here.|- That's all right. We'll order another round. Waiter! I think we'Ve all had enough,|Mr. Gallagher. What's the matter, can't take it? It's a Very strange thing. I once did some research on|the psychological aspects of inebriation. I'Ve deVeloped what you might call|a mental control of liquor's effects. I can drink any amount at all,|and it doesn't bother me a bit. It doesn't bither me a bot, either! - Thank you.|- Thanks. It's been loVely. Waiter! - You leaVing, too?|- Yes. Can we giVe you a lift? No, it's all right. It's all right. - Need a little help with your friend?|- No. I'll manage. Just get us a cab. Yes, sir. - Let us giVe you a lift home, old man.|- Don't old man me, old man! - I'll be okay.|- Of course you will. All you need is a bit of oxygen. Here, just take a good, deep breath|of air. Like this. Hugo, are you all right? May I come in?|Just a minute. Come in. - Will this help?|- Yeah, thanks. For him? Nothing will help him. How do you feel? I neVer sobered up so fast in all my life. Seeing him in the gutter|was better than a Turkish bath. Well, I neVer... What happened? Oxygen. It'll do it eVery time. Oh, dear, and he has a 8:00 class|in the morning. Not tomorrow morning. Why don't you cross|with the light sometime? You'll find it a wonderful experience! You know, you were right about Pine.|He's quite a guy. - Yes, he is.|- Good at eVerything. - Sometimes that's quite a strain.|- Strain? Yes, you keep wanting him to miss.|Just once. Like tonight, I think I liked him best of all|when he fell flat on his face. - You know what I mean?|- I know what you mean. Oh, dear. It makes people human|to do something wrong once in a while. - Like you.|- Me? This eVening, in my office. Not that I'm for encouraging|that sort of thing, you understand. No, of course not. The teacher-student relationship|is a Very complex one. Very. You haVe to be friendly and... and yet keep your distance|at the same time. Sure. Otherwise, how would you... eVer maintain discipline? That'd be tough. Thank you so much|for bringing me home. It was Very nice of you and I had a- - Cup of coffee?|- I could use one. Would you like to see the View? If you lean out far enough, it's not bad. Not bad in here, either. You know, I could kill|that secretary of yours. She had me conVinced|that you and the doctor... were about to become a Vital statistic. Hugo? Hugo and I|are collaborating on a book. Yes. The Psychological Factors|of Newspaper Readership. Say, that's a pretty racy title. Would you like a bite to eat|with that coffee? You can set the table, if you will. You sure it's not too much trouble?|Only takes a minute. Instant... Now, you'Ve heard of instant coffee.|And I know you'Ve heard of instant tea. Well, all you guys,|just feast your eyes on little old instant me I haVen't known her Very long.|Really? She's a friend of that reporter|I told you about. That's where you met her. 'Cause I'm the girl who invented rock 'n' roll Nice kid. Supports an inValid mother. Is that right? Now, that's sweet. 'Cause I'm the she You're looking at me Yes, I'm the girl who invented rock 'n' roll And another thing.|Take the knife out of my back. 'Cause I'm the dame The dame to blame Yes, I'm the girl who invented rock 'n' roll She's off on Mondays.|Maybe you could fill in for her. Well, I think|that would be Very nice. I'll inVite the whole class. - Where's another chair?|- In there. 'Cause I'm the dame The dame to blame Yes, I'm the girl who invented rock 'n' roll "Joel Barlow Stone. " You found me out, huh? Joel Barlow Stone. Erica Stone. What did your father do?|He ran a country newspaper. - That's all it was.|- The Eureka Bulletin. A country newspaper|read around the world. - I neVer tied it up. You and-|- I'm glad. At least I know you didn't come to class|because I'm my father's daughter. That small one's the editorial he wrote|when he won the Pulitzer Prize. The Bulletin's front page, the last one. That was on his desk|as long as I can remember. What's the matter? Nothing. It's just that I feel like|a would-be inVentor... going through Edison's workshop. People always talk about him|as if he were some sort of a giant. You know something? He was just a hard-headed Hoosier with|a way of putting his finger on the truth. I think you'd haVe liked him, Jim.|I know he'd haVe liked you. Of course, I neVer read his newspaper|but I certainly read about him. I'Ve got stacks of old copies. Some day we'll go through them|if you'd like. BelieVe me,|this is an education in itself. I'll bet it is. That's what this book that|I'm writing with Dr. Pine is about. To show why The Bulletin was so great. It's sort of a blueprint of journalism|for students to read and follow. I once asked you|why you took up teaching. I can see now. Yes, I want to get across his|ideas. What a newspaper meant to him. Jim, I'd like you to keep it. It should belong to|a good newspaperman. But you will be. My father always said|I had a better nose... for newspapermen than for news. I can't take that.|Yes, you can. Consider it a bribe, huh? - Bribe?|- Yes. For you to stick to the decision|that you made tonight. I know it isn't easy to giVe up|a steady job for something... that seems like a gamble.|But I haVe so much faith in you, Jim. I'll help you get started-|No. - I'll do eVerything-|- I can't... But I want to. Don't you understand? Jim... this morning you were|just a Very talented pupil. But tonight... I think we're being whistled at. How about some raspberries? We haVe a little... scrambled eggs? Bacon and tomato sandwich? Mr. Gallagher, you're pretty hard|to please, I must say. Oh, dear, that's had it. Say, how about some waffles? If I do say so myself,|I make Very good hot... Jim? Good morning. HangoVer? Calling what I haVe a hangoVer... is like referring to|the Johnstown Flood... as a slight drizzle. I'm sorry you missed that 8:00 class. I may miss the whole semester. What do you want? I just wanted to see how you felt.|I was wondering if there's... Do you mind if I haVe some coffee? If you don't rattle the cup and saucer. Please. I'Ve tried some morning-after cure-alls|in my time, but this is about the most- The recipe was giVen to me|by an anthropologist. It's... a mixture used by a tribe of cannibals|in the Melanesian Islands. They drink this brew|wheneVer they eat a poisoned enemy. Of course, it really should|be made with a lizard egg. But you can't haVe eVerything. Now, what do you want? - Well, this friend of mine-|- Please... don't shout. I wasn't shouting. To my ears, at the moment,|you sound like a parade of banshees. Well, you're an authority|on human behaViour. I thought so until last night. You'Ve made a study of the reactions|of indiViduals under certain conditions. Also mice. Well. This friend of mine... Max Minnick... he came to me the other day with... a personal problem.|He wanted my adVice. I didn't know what to tell him. I haVe a feeling if he doesn't handle|this just right... he's in real trouble. You see, he met this girl... Yeah, that's quite a problem. I would adVise that... Oh, there's more? Now... this girl knew Max only by name,|and she hated his guts. So, in order to get anyplace,|he used a phoney name... Max Martin. They'Ve been getting along great... but it can't go on like this. What should he do? Well, it all depends. Is he in loVe with her,|or is this merely a transitory amour? It started out as a sort of|a hit-and-run proposition but he didn't... I guess you could say|he was sort of in loVe with her. Is he planning to marry her? Oh, no. Max isn't the marrying kind. Yet he didn't take adVantage of this|hit-and-run proposition. It's therefore obVious|that Max has affection... and a deep respect toward this lady. Yeah, he's got that. She's just|not one of those dames, you know. In that case, it's entirely possible... that he might find a respectable union... such as marriage,|not completely repugnant to him. I neVer thought of Max as the sort that... You might haVe a point there, Doc. And Max might haVe more character|and probity than you giVe him credit for. Could be. Excuse me. I'll get it. What should Max do, Doc? Under the circumstances, I would|adVise him to be completely honest... and reVeal eVerything. You would, huh? If she's half the woman he thinks she is,|she'll understand and forgiVe him. After all, the man's the same. Only the names haVe been changed|to protect the guilty. But he must do it right away. Yes. If she finds out by herself,|Max gets the axe. All right. Thanks. I'll tell Max. - Goodbye, Doc.|- Goodbye, Max. How'd you know? Why, I'm hung-oVer, not unconscious. But I didn't say one word|that you could... You're forgetting last night. I didn't say anything last night that-|But she did. The minute I picked her up,|I knew instantly... something new had been added. To begin with,|she forgot to say, "Happy Birthday. " And all she could talk about|was this unusual new student of hers. EVery time I changed the subject,|she came right back to it. She did? Constantly, Mr. Gallagher, or Minnick,|or Martin, or whateVer your name is. Well, my real name's Gannon. Gannon of the insulting letter? You know about that, too? She showed it to me|the moment she receiVed it. As a matter of fact, I told her|what to say to the class in reply. So you were the one. Say, you said|some pretty rotten things about me. No, she didn't use my reply,|because I agreed with you. To me, journalism is... like a hangoVer. You can read about it for years|but until you'Ve actually experienced it... you haVe no conception|of what it's really like. That's what I felt, but... I'Ve got to admit I'm beginning to think|there's something... to this education bit, too. The rest of your letter, howeVer,|I found filled with... puerility, guilt, and insecurity... reVealing you,|psychologically speaking... a complete mess. Now wait a minute. Now, it's useless for you to hit me.|I'm going to die anyway. Just leaVe me alone|and let me expire in peace. Goodbye, and don't slam the door. Another thing. Don't feel too badly|about passing out last night. I gaVe that waiter $5|to spike your drinks. Now I understand. I only gaVe him $2 to spike yours. - Jim, the Colonel's been calling you.|- All right. - Jim, the Colonel wants to see you.|- All right. - Jim, the Colonel's been calling you.|- I know. Barney! Gladys, get me- Yeah, I know he wants me.|Get me this call first. Miss Erica Stone, Plaza 3-5-5-9-8. That's right. Call the barber and tell him I'll be down|in an hour for a haircut and a manicure. Good morning, Mr. Gannon. Get this hat cleaned and blocked|and this thing pressed. What's the matter?|Can't a guy get cleaned up once a year? I'Ve got some cologne in my locker. Yeah? Oh, she's not? Gladys, do me a faVour. Call the florist|and haVe him send her some roses. He knows the address.|And put on the card: "Pick you up at 6:30". Sign it "Jim. " Yeah, I'm gonna|see the Colonel right now. Send him right in. You better cancel that luncheon|engagement. I don't think I can make it. Glad you came right in, Jim. I haVe someone|I want you to meet. Her father|was an old friend of mine. Erica, this is Jim Gannon... the best city editor in the business,|for my money. Jim, this is Miss Stone.|She teaches journalism, which... makes us all related|in a way, doesn't it? Miss Stone's come to ask|a faVour of me. She's quite excited about|a student of hers, a fellow called... what was that name again? Gallagher.|Ah, yes. It seems this Gallagher|is quite exceptional. Miss Stone brought along some things|he wrote. Class work, you know. Very good, she says.|I'll read them tonight. Now then, it seems to be|generally known that you haVe some... well, shall we say resistance|to college-trained personnel. Miss Stone is quite aware of that. But she feels this particular fellow|is so outstanding... he may be just the one|to change your attitude. Colonel... I wonder if I could talk to Miss Stone|for a few minutes? Why, of course.|I mean, alone. I'd like to correct any misconceptions|she might haVe. That's a good idea.|I'll bring her in to you in a few minutes. We haVe a bit more catching up to do|before I giVe her up. - But, Colonel, I-|- And thank you for your cooperation. You know who I had a letter from today?|John Baldwin. He was an old friend of your father's. I remember when the three of us|went to Europe together. That was in 1927. Now look, Erica, before you|blow your top, I just want to... What's the matter? Aren't you angry? No, I'm not angry. I just feel a little bruised... as if I'd been kicked. - I'm sorry, Erica, I was going-|- You don't haVe to explain, Mr. Gannon. I'm sure to you and the boys|it was a Very funny practical joke. You may haVe eVen bet a few dollars|that you could make... the professor look like an idiot. Well, you did. Now why don't you go collect your bets|and leaVe me alone? All right, I admit it started out|as a joke, but that didn't last long. Why do you think I left your apartment|so suddenly last night? I'm sure you had a pang|of conscience. I doubt if anyone- I didn't want to hurt you|any more than I already had. What you did to me is unimportant. But what you did to the other students|is inexcusable. They pay their tuition|which they can ill afford. And after working hard|at other jobs all day long... they study or they come to class|because they'll sacrifice anything... - to gain a little more knowledge.|- Now, wait a minute- I don't expect you|to understand, Mr. Gannon. You're stupid... and I think you're proud of it. And this makes you cruel. And now, may I leaVe, if you're finished? Are you finished now? Roy, here's that|Women's Federation story. What about this, Jim? Handle it any way you want. I do something wrong? No. Look, yell at me, swear at me,|but please don't be quiet and polite. It's not like you, Jim. Sorry. I'll watch myself. They look like new, Mr. Gannon. - Hang them on the cabinet, will you?|- Yes, sir. Well, it's wet and warm anyway, Jim. Mr. Gannon? Yeah. Wanna look oVer the obituaries I did?|Roy says they're not bad. WheneVer you get time. Barney... sit down a minute. Barney... I'Ve been thinking it oVer... and I'Ve decided|that your mother is right. I think you better go back|and finish school. My mother's-|Now, let's put it this way. You'll only be quitting|for a few years... and when you want to come back-|I won't quit. Then I'll haVe to fire you. Just when I'm getting started? You won't do any worse|with an education... and you might do a lot better. What's wrong with this stuff?|Just tell me one thing. Well, for one thing,|how do you spell "philanthropist"? How'd you learn to|spell "philanthropist"? The way I learned to spell|eVerything else. One lousy letter at a time. But the hard way|isn't always the best way. I'm not sure it eVer is. You'Ve always told me experience is|the most important thing that- Experience is the jockey.|Education is the horse. You'll find out there are|a lot of other places in the world... beside this city room. You only spend eight hours a day here. If you're lucky, you sleep eight. That leaVes eight hours more|to talk to... other people about other things. And if all you know is newspapers... you'll always be excusing yourself|and leaVing the table. I'Ve spent one-third of my life... going to, staying in, and coming back|from men's rooms. And that's not going to happen to you. You're fired! - Max got the axe.|- I know, she called me. I tried to tell her of your belated surge|of honesty, but she wouldn't listen. Am I interrupting you working? No, merely trying to get|my mind off my head. Been going through some old copies|of her father's newspaper. Research for the book|we're doing together. Now, don't worry.|She'll forgiVe you eVentually. No. When they hang in your arms|like an old laundry bag... it's all oVer, brother. Nonsense. First she'll go through the typical|feminine reaction of indignation... then indifference, then indigestion,|then insomnia. Then she'll accept|your apologies retroactiVely. It's not what I'Ve done. It's what she's done to me. Before, I had contempt|for eggheads like her and you. Well, I was wrong.|Brother, was I wrong. But at least I was definitely wrong. I was an obstinate, prejudiced,|inconsiderate, cold-hearted louse! But at least I was something! Now that I'Ve learned to|respect your kind... I'm just a big understanding|remorseful slob. A complete zero. That's too bad. Maybe you'll get oVer it. Would you like a drink? I sure would. Could I haVe a martini?|That's what I started on. You'll haVe to fix it.|Just the thought makes my head thump. You don't know what it's like|to liVe one way all your life... confident that you're right... and then suddenly find out|that you're all wrong. I'm like a guy whose house|just burned down. I'Ve got no place to go. When did this feeling of inadequacy|first manifest itself? I guess it's been creeping up on me|for years, like ivy. But it really started|when she got me asking myself why. Now I question eVerything I do. And then this morning,|she called me stupid. Well, two weeks ago,|I would haVe belted her. But this morning I say to myself: "Why did she call me stupid?" And the answer came to me like that. Because I am stupid. Vermouth. Ice. I'm sorry, I used it all. - Join me?|- Oh, no, thanks. Nothing in gin that can hurt you.|Best thing for your stomach. Well, all right. Let me make sure|the window's closed first. Gannon... I'm gonna haVe to disagree with you. You're not the least stupid. But like so many self-made men... you refuse to|trust your own intelligence. Intelligence? I know chimpanzees|who haVe a better education than I haVe. I had to cut cards with the teacher|to see if I got through the eighth grade. You're confusing education|with schooling. Education is|the acquisition of knowledge. Which I haVe acquired not one ounce of. Now, don't be so sure. If you look it up, you'll find that|the definition of knowledge is... "knowing, familiarity|gained by experience". You'll also find that wisdom is... defined as "the possession|of experience and knowledge. " Being experienced, you therefore|haVe education, you haVe knowledge... and you haVe wisdom. You're brilliant... - and you make a good martini.|- Look... here's a press pass.|This proVes that I'm a newspaperman. Here's a driVer's licence... this proVes I'Ve passed a driVing test. Now, you're a Ph. D. That proVes|that you're an educated man. You know,|I don't eVen haVe a high school diploma. When you haVe one, it doesn't mean|anything, you lose it, throw it away. But if you'Ve neVer had one... and you get to my age... it's like the Nobel Prize. Gannon... I'Ve sat on many uniVersity accreditation|committees and I promise... before you leaVe tonight|you'll haVe a B.A. in Lillibral Arts. Lillibral? There's oxygen seeping|into this room from some place. Now. The first thing we haVe to do|is get you through high school. I think you're ready for college. Now, let's try this. That's great. No, a Bachelor of Arts|leaVes it buttoned. When you get your Master's Degree... - then you can wear it open.|- No, it's no use, Doc. I may look like a scholar|on the outside... but inside I'm still an idiot. - No.|- An experienced idiot... but I'm still an idiot. Now, don't start doubting yourself again. I can't help it.|I'Ve lost all my confidence. I'm not eVen sure I know anything... about the newspaper business|anymore. Maybe she's right. Maybe my kind did go out|with Prohibition. That must be one of my students.|Why don't you just relax for a minute? I'll get rid of him. Good eVening. - Feeling better?|- Yes, a little. - How do you feel?|- I'm fine. What I meant is... I'd be happy to make it|another night if you'd like. - It doesn't bother me, really...|- It's fine. I brought some of Dad's|original notes with me. I thought it may be interesting|in Chapter Four to show the genesis... of some of the editorials, you know? And trace them through|the first draft and a brief... He's in the bedroom. He'll be all right,|I guess, in a couple of weeks. What's the matter with him? Utterly despondent, remorseful. Filled with contrition|and ideas of self-destruction. - But, Hugo-|- Martini? No, thank you. But what surprises me|is the way you treated him. The way I treated... - What he did to me-|- But you should haVe asked yourself... why he did it. You'Ve taken two years of psychology|from me, you should haVe a little... understanding of these things. What motiVated this deception of his? A desire to humiliate|and hurt me, that's what- NeVer. He has a deep affection|for you, Erica Stone... but he is in rebellion against|what you represent. Here's a man in a responsible position,|who feels insecure and... inferior because|he has no formal education. He meets a teacher,|the symbol of academic achieVement. By deceiVing, dominating, and|outwitting the teacher, he experiences... the exhilarating feeling of superiority. His battered and cringing ego|emerges Victorious. He's not to be held in contempt... he's to be pitied. I just neVer thought of it in that way. And you should haVe seen him|when he came here this eVening. All of his confidence,|his security completely gone. A mere shadow of a man... doubting his Very self. You haVe taken this once proud|and forceful man... and made of him a weakling... bewildered and floundering|in a sea of doubt. Joel Barlow Stone. I'm sorry, but you stink. Now, when he comes out,|be warm and understanding. Gannon! Doc, I got my confidence back. You know what did it for me?|Reading The Eureka Bulletin. I'm suddenly sure of what|good journalism should be... because this is one of|the lousiest papers I'Ve eVer seen. What's the matter? Your head again? No, yours. I'll bet he got a hold of|one of those copies that came out... while your father was on his Vacation.|Didn't you? No. And I'm not going to|try to back out of this one. I'm sorry I hurt you again, but at least|this time it was done with honesty. Martini, anyone? Please go on, Mr. Gannon. I'm Very interested|in getting your critical opinion... of a newspaper like The Bulletin. Well... to begin with, it isn't eVen a newspaper. It's a guy sitting around|a cracker-barrel, talking and talking. Isn't it interesting that the Pulitzer Prize|Committee didn't agree with you? He won the prize for an editorial,|and it was a brilliant job. But he should have stuck to|the editorial page... and let someone run... the paper who hated words. Now, here's a world-shaking story|on Page 1. At least four columns... all about whether those berries|Art Smith was selling yesterday... were blueberries or huckleberries. Look at this. Published twice weekly... circulation 2,500... one page of adVertising... with no other sheet|to giVe him competition. That isn't a newspaper, it's a hobby! You know... you may not belieVe it, but I'm interested|in those kids you're teaching. But in the name of Pulitzer,|tell them the truth! Tell them this is a business, a rough,|tough, fighting, clawing business. The Chronicle has a circulation|of a half million. Each copy sells for a dime|and costs at least 10 cents to print. We stay aliVe by adVertising... the same as eVery other paper|in this town... and we battle each other for it. Why, I wind up with only|49 columns for news... and I won't waste four of them|on whether those berries Art Smith... was selling yesterday|were blueberries or huckleberries. You're confusing journalism|with loyalty... and you're giVing this paper... a sentimental reVerence|it doesn't deserve. Do me a favour. Tear off the title|and forget your father wrote it. Put in eight pages of adVertising|and then take an honest blue pencil... to the rest|and see what you come up with. If it's still the same paper... then you better|put this back on his desk. You gaVe it to the wrong fellow. LeaVe it go,|maybe the whole joint will burn. Don't pour the coffee on it, it'll explode. HOCHULl: Hey, Jim, you got somebody|to coVer a fire? I got a fire of my own.|The Colonel just sent for me. Hot copy. Let it burn for an hour,|it'll make a better story. Maybe this will help. Take it out and burn it. Good morning, Colonel.|Good morning, Jim. You remember Miss Stone. She's come back today with an idea... which strikes me|as being an excellent one. She thought that if we... But you go ahead, Erica.|After all, it's your idea. Thank you, Colonel. Mr. Gannon, I'Ve been doing|a lot of thinking... and, well... when one teaches the same courses|semester after semester... one is apt to repeat certain examples|and certain concepts. Yes, one is apt to. And with the constant repetition... if one is not careful, there... is a danger of their becoming|dogmatic principles. - Yes, you're quite right.|- Not only in teaching, my dear... but if we're not careful|we get into ruts, too. Only this morning, at the staff meeting,|Jim made the point that... although we haVe to keep The Chronicle|Vital and exciting and commercial... perhaps we ought to do a little more|interpretation of the news... giVe our readers a little more|to think about. Isn't that right, Jim? But pardon me|for interrupting you, dear. That's perfectly all right, Colonel. Mr. Gannon, I was wondering if I could|preVail upon you to giVe a series... of guest lectures to my classes? You know, the practical|touch added to the academic approach? The wedding of the old pros|and the eggheads. Weren't those your words?|Exactly, Colonel. Or perhaps we could debate certain|aspects of journalism. The students might find it|Very stimulating. They sure might. Well, I'll let you two|work it out. Goodbye, my dear... and please feel free|to call on me at any time. Goodbye, Colonel,|and thank you Very much. Not at all. Jim... last night I read this think piece... you know, the one the student wrote. It's long, but I think it's newsworthy. - Bye-bye, Colonel.|- Goodbye. Long, huh? I didn't write it. One of the staff did. To me, anything oVer 500 words|is a noVel. When do we start this clambake? Well, I haVe a class tonight. Of course you understand that|the uniVersity can't pay you anything. But since you'll be giVing a series of|lectures, the Dean would like to... giVe you faculty status. Me, on a faculty? No, I don't think... Well, no... That's a little ridiculous.|I wouldn't know... - We'll talk it oVer at lunch.|- All right. I'll get my coat and hat. - Hiya, Jim.|- Hello, Bob. - Mr. Gannon?|- Yeah. Hello, Mrs. KoVac. I just came to pick up Barney's things. Sure. I was hoping I'd bump into you|so I could thank you. For what? For sending Barney|back to school, for what. Is he really going? He's making lots of noises|about getting another job... and he's sore as a boil at you. But I know him, he'll go back. You know why? 'Cause you said so. Tell him the day after he graduates,|I want him to report back. What time? 9:00, and tell him not to be late. You know something? I like you. I don't care what anybody says,|I like you. Goodbye, Mr. Gannon. Goodbye, Mrs. KoVac. ...informal at times, and a little brutal|and hard to accept... but it's been an education. I didn't know you two knew each other. I took a class from Miss Stone|a couple of years ago. Too bad you didn't learn anything.|Come here. Look, Miller, we sell adVertising... at $25 an inch. The space you use we can't sell. Take this story,|and save us about $300. And don't just make the lead a rehash. Recent eVidence discloses|that the kid had accomplices. No. Salas was alone|when he killed the old man. He had four partners always with him. PoVerty, prejudice,|bitterness, and despair. Salas pulled the trigger|but they loaded the gun. - Light?|- Thanks. What are you waiting for?|You want me to write it for you? Ready? Who's the dame? That's Joel Barlow Stone's daughter. That's a combination for you. What haVe they got in common? If I know Jim, he'll find something.
