My dear friend, today they're... ...they're after a rabbit, but tomorrow they'll be after you. Adam, for the love of God, they're just children... My Janek is a child.

And did you know... ...the old lady committed suicide... ...when Adam Rasumowski was killed hunting and... - Shut up, Vince...- Waitwait, listen... She set herself on fire... That's the truth. And... ..and the others just barely saved themselves. Vince! We can't keep hiding like rabbits in a burrow. We'll dig up Rasumowski's money... ...go see master Gruinius, and buy our freedom. We'll buy horses, I'll get a sword... ...and we'll see the sea, Vince. - What?. The sea?.-That's right, Vince. You promise?. Vince... ...I never make promises. I dream. I want and I dream. And sometimes dreams come true. Right?. Let's go,Vince. But how do you knowwhere the money is?. The one-legged organist told me. But he can't even talk.

(In Russian)Your Highness, Lieutenant Rasumowski. Yes. Leave him with me. - But...- Get out of here, you swine. Rasumowski. Janek Rasumowski. Precisely, Your Highness. So, you've made a lot of enemies, Lieutenant... Your Highness, my enemies are my business... A smart ass, what a smart ass. I love them. What, are you all like that over there in the Northwest?. You're from Lithuania, aren't you?. I'm a Pole, Your Highness. I haven't been there since my dear parents died 15 years ago. Well, we'll take care ofthat. Of course, some people would like to have you shot. But I have different plans, Lieutenant. But... I don't quite understand what you're saying, Your Highness... Well, as you probably know... ...our Emperor Alexander - praise his sacred name, good Lord... ...has decided to give the land to the serfs... ... over in that Northwest of yours. To the savage Lithuanians themselves. Take as many people as you need to suppress the rebellion. ButYour Highness, as far as I know, there is no rebellion there. There will be. And you will be the one who takes care of it. Only everything has to lookgenuine. But... But soon, my dear, such things will begin there... ...that there won't even be time to plough the land. None at all. Thankyou, Ferdinandas. A good book. Please get out. FrancaisAllemand... Get out! Bernardas, why all the emotion?. And by theway, what does the word "argent" mean?. Please leave. Bernardas, the payments are late. I told you, you'll get them. La argent, la argent... ...Ia argent, la argent... I need them now, right away. You'll ruin my estate. You, YourWorship, are the ruin... ...ofyour own estate. You have been for a long time. And I am just the obedient servant offate. You... bastard. YourWorship... ...you owe your entire life to this bastard. You know where you can shove those debts?. Tomorrow. Sir, someone to see you. Junior Officer of the Imperial Army. Lieutenant Rasumowskii. Janek, uncle. Adam's son. Adam! Adam! Thankyou, Edmundas, you may go. Yes, but... Thankyou! At your service, gentlemen. A servant of fate, as they say. Let me helpyou... Thankyou very much. Welcome back. - It's been so many years.- Uncle. You've grown up... I have news. Important news. From Petersburg. Bravo... Bravo! - What are you doing?. -You'll see. Coal, give me the coal. - What do you need coal for?. -You'll see, relax... Give me your heart! Let's go... Iet's go. Where are we going?. Sit up straight. Admit it, the forest is alive with spirits at night. I'm not afraid of any spirits. Motiejus, whatwould you wish for ifyou ever found a fern flower?. I don't know, maybe... shoes?. Shoes. But those are just things. What do you dream of?. Things are things, Morta. They're much better than stupid dreams. What a bore! - What?.- A bore! - What?.- Boredom.A bore. Motiejus is a bore! - Everything is clear?.- As day. 98... - Repeat it.- I'm not a child. 100... You watch out... Being secretive?. No! Edmundas was just telling me how you're getting along here. I wasjust about to tell the young man... what a wonderful hunter you are! Of course... I left the most interesting parts... ...forYourWorship to tell yourself... - Janek...- Madam Konstancija... Kristina has already finished playing. - Do you dance?.- With pleasure. Madam Konstancija, I just remembered... Dances... I should have gotten rid ofyou long ago. No balls. Here.All ofit.

It's gotten more expensive... - Where are you going?.-To hell! As far from your secrets as possible. A bore, you say?. ... a bore. Pure boredom?. A mosquito. You toads! You snots! Ladies. Rittmeister Snegiriov's squadron will be here shortly. We only have to hold out for a few more days. But there is no one to hold out against, Bernardas. Emperor Alexander has signed a manifesto. He has granted freedom to the serfs. Don't tell me, my friends... ...that he's messing around with those serfs again... Words like that can get you to Siberia... No need to iintiimiidate us. Gentlemen, please, it's no time to argue. Indeed. You should thinkaboutwhat you're going to do with your serfs instead. They'll be full of themselves now. Butwhy do you think they're going to up and rebel?. Why, they got their freedom. What are they going to do with that freedom of theirs?. Eat iit?. Spread it on some bread? The serfs may have gotten their freedom... ...but there is something they didn't get. Land. Listen, gentlemen - whether a peasant's free or not, he still has to eat. And since the land is ours, he's not going to go far. - Well said.- Damn, now they're going to give us... Edmundas, finally. Men, Edmundas is here. Edmundas is here. Hey, Edmundas has news. Brothers! What's happened?. The czar! The czar what?. The czar has signed a manifesto. What?. What did he sign?. A manifesto. Awhat?. He has aboliished serfdom. How do you know that?. Gruinius said so. How diid he abolish iit?. Just like that. You'll no longer have to bow to the gentry. You'll no longer have to plough their land. So what are we supposed to do?. I don't know. So who knows?. Who, Gruinius knows! Go and ask him! What, right now?. No, wait for winter. It'll be easierto plough the land. Go over to Gruinius' and ask him who's the master now! Dear people, if there's no more serfdom, that means freedom. We have to celebrate! Freedom, freedom! Go. Let's go to Gruinius'! Go, all of you. Go. Who is the master in Birzulenai?. And notjust one estate. The women and children. Didn't leave anyone alive. Burned everything to ashes. Lord Jesus. ThankGod it's far from here. Notthatfar... "'No matter how much you feed the wolf, it still looks to the forest", huh?. Just imagine, they'll come to you with scythes. And they're coming. With scythes, with torches, axes and pitchforks. Impressive speech, Lieutenant, real poetry. Not poetry. I'm just saying that... if you need my help, my men and I are always here. How kind, how kind. You can't understand Lithuanians with your mind... Where did you get such delicious vodka?. - What is it?. - Son of a bitch... Here it goes. Oh Lord. Ladies, everyone to the estate! Ladies and gentlemen, don't panic. Keep calm. To arms! Faster - to the estate. Come on, get moving! Where's Kristina?. Put down your weapons! Attack! Leave no one alive! Mount! Jonas, Jesus! What's that?. Vince! Motiejus! Vince, you fool! Quick, get out of here! Rebel... So, son of a bitch?. Water. Rebel. It's written all over your face. Well, your face reminds me of a horse's ass. Sure - you only know how to beat people who are tied-up and unarmed. Right?. No balls... In the Caucasus we would have cut open your belly... ...and watched as the dogs ate your guts outwhile you were still alive. So go back to your Casus then... Tomorrow, he'll talk. Let's go. - Vince.-Vince,Vince. Motiejus. Why do I always have to save your ass, huh?. - Because I have a grade-A ass. -That ass of yours is hairy. Let's go,Tadas. - You go, I'll catch up. Run.- Fool. Get moving, run, run, run! No, Edmundas, no, come on, please. No, no, really. My God. Nothing is sacred to you. Stop, Edmundas, stop. Have pity, for God's sake,I really need it right now. I'vewaited so long. And I haven't?. And you with your... .."I'll thinkof everything, I'll take care of everything". But all you really care about is getting under my skirt. That's it. Everything is even better than we expected, Konstancija. We're so close... Fire! Hey! Stop! Stop! What are you doing here?. Where?. In my bed. Escapiing. They'll get you anyway. No theywon't. Their arms are too short. So where are you going to go now?. Are you going to climb into some stinking hole... ...and sit there for the rest ofyour life?. What, little bird.. ...you think a golden cage is better than a stinking hole?. Of course, ifyou always getwhat you want... At least I knowwhat I want. I also knowwhat I want. What?. I want to smell the mist when it rises from the lake in the morning... I want to feel a horse when it's running free through the fields... The grass growing - I want to hear the grass growing. Quietly, quietly, and no one can even hear it. The horses, catch the horses! Kristina, open up. Kriistina... What?. What?. Is everything all right?. Everything's fine.

Motiejus. Motiejus, I... I'm sorry. - I thou... I thought that...- Don't think. Don't think. Feel. Feel. Feel. And ifyou have any balls at all, do something so that... ...no one has to suffer because of you again. Drink, drink. Drink some more. There's a rebel in here!Take him away! What's going on here, leave him... - Leave hiim Father! - Step away! - Dear God, leave him! - Father!- Step away, I saiid! Halt! Back, I said! Thesewill lie here until we hang all of the rebels in the gallows. That's not Christian, Lieutenant. You won't earn the respect of the serfs with prayers... ...Officer. Search all of thevillages. Checkevery house. Who's inciting the rebels, who's hiding. Within at least 10versts. And you'll leave your men here... ...so they don't drag the bodies away like rats. Got it?. Tie them up! Just lookwhat men they killed. Animals... Just lookwhat men they killed. But the rebels were maybe a hundred men. And they burned Gruinius' estate to ashes. As I love God. They burned down the stables. What stables - they burned the entire estate to the ground. His fist is like an anvil. He put down a whole troop of Cossacks with one hand. - Did anyone see him?. The rebel leader. - Yes, he's as big as a mountain! What are you looking at, you little snot?. Get out of here! You son of a bitch, tell me, who's helping the rebels?. Butwe're not even from thatvillage. You're all rebels over there.This is the last time I'm going to ask... ...or I'll feed you all to the crayfish. Forpitys sake, we've never even seen them! Shut up, you piece of trash! Which of you instigated the rebels?. Have mercy, Your Excellency. Where are the rebels hiding, huh?. I did everything... Your Excellency, we've got a real madman here... I did everything! Get him out of my face... - I iinciited the rebels... -What?. ...and burned down the stables, I did everything... Name, surname. Blinda, Your Worship. Tadas Blinda. Hang him. Have mercy. YourWorship, I know where they're hiding. I know where the rebels are. They're hiding in the swamp. Shut up, damn it! Well, all right. But if you blink an eye... ...or even fart at the wrong time... ...you can't imagine how much pain a person can feel... Stay on your toes. They're fighting for our freedom, and who are you?. The rebels are shedding blood for you. There are no rebels and there is no rebellion. Quiet! Here, this is the path they rode down. - Here?.- Here. I don't see any path. I know the swamps, I'll lead you. Untie him! You bastard... I hope they make you drink your own piss... Calm down, you peasants. Get them out of the way. March, march... Filthy pigs... Come on, move it... Hold them! Hold them! Stand! Stand, you filthy bastards! You asses, move it... Run! Hold them! Hold them! Drown, you bastard! I told you I'd save you. Thanks! Well, birdy... Get ready to visit Abraham, you bastard... Men, men...what are you doing... - Hm... I wonder?.- I saved your asses! Shut your mouth, you make me sick. You stupid fools. So ifyou hang me, who's going to lead the rebels?. You can lead them in hell. But before God... You'll be able to speak with the gods real soon... Before God, men... You rotten bastard... Tadas!

I can breathe freely! That's it! Nowthat'sfreedom! When you can breathe and not be afraid that you'll suffocate! Motiejus! Don't tell me that this isTadas'... Tadas'... So he's the one who set this hell on fire?. Yes, itwas him. Unfortunately for us... Thankyou. Why are you hiding?. You know... ...horses are better than people. They understand everything... They never betray you... They'll run away if things are bad, but theywon't betray you. Father... The world has changed, Kristina. I've changed. Don't... I can't tell my friends from my enemies anymore. Everything will be all right, Father... No iitwon't. No, Kristina. God said not to kill. He also saiid notto use God's name iin vaiin. Bernardas, Bernardas... In your own house - like a thief. You're worse than a thief. You know what you are?. I know, a bastard. I know a lot. What others should know too. Especially our young Rasumowski. Mayyou vanish into thin air with that Rasumowski! Don't fool around, Adam. What's this?. An endowment note... Awhat?. That you, charmed with the loyalty of your obedient servant... ...and the merits of his entire life... ...give him what previously belonged to Adam Rasumowski... ...well, the person that you killed... ...butwhich is now your estate, with all of its land.

So why are the gendarmes running around like they got their tails cut off?. Not giving regular folkany peace... We're the ones who shouldn't be giving them any peace... ...shake them up, so they pay some notice! So what are you going to shake them up with?. Well, old man, what are you going to shake them up with?. Gonna shove your finger in their ass?. Or maybe they'll enjoy it?. I'd rather go backto work the land. I'm sick of bowing to the master... ...what kind of freedom is this if they take everything for themselves. There is no freedom. No freedom, got it?. And there's no rebellion! Stop making me laugh, people. And you - what are you looking at?. Are you Blinda?. Well, yeah. Prove it... Prove what?. Prove that you're Blinda. Come on, Jonas... Come on, Jonas... Come on, Tadas... I don't need anyone to shed blood for me. I don't need anyone to shed blood for me. For you?. You're notworth a red cent. So why did you drag yourselves over here?. We're going to fightfor freedom.

Janek rode out to meet them. You're in for trouble. No we're not, Kristina. Our land protects us. How beautiiful. Just charming. Beautiful, that Lithuania. Lithuania, my homeland. Beautiful. Only there's too many Lithuanians here. And I'm sorry to say that I thought that you Poles loved Lithuanians. And I'm sorry to say that I thought that you Poles loved Lithuanians. You even lived together, had a joint government. Poles are a nation of kings and noblemen. But Lithuanians - cads and peasants. No culture, no language... ...the slops have been serving us Poles for centuries. And now they serve Emperor Alexander. And now they serve Emperor Alexander. And what of it, they're born rebels.

And then... and then Tadas says to him... he says:. "YourWorship, I think your mug looks like a horse's ass!" Proceed... Your Highness, Mr. Gruinius is here to see you. To hell with him... ...has Lieutenant Rasumowski turned up yet?. Not at all, Your Highness. Get out of here, I said! Get out of here, get out of harm's way! Ifyou don't mind... His Majesty is very unhappywith you, Mr. Gruinius, very unhappy. - Your Honour...- A nobleman... ...allied with the serfs, against the authorities. Against the authorities... Against the authorities. Get out of here! Your Highness. What do you want to say?. What, you can't placate your serfs even a bit?. Or maybe you don't want to?. Or maybe you're hiding them?. A conspiracy?. A conspiracy against the emperor himself... - Your Honour...- Silence! I know you Poles. My own mother was Lithuanian. That's what you're after - to get your old Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth back! You brainless Polish fool! I am a Liithuaniian nobleman. And this is Lithuanian land... You dog shit! You stinking shit! When you'll be rotting in Siberia, no onewill even ask your name. Either you bring me that Blianda straight away, dead or alive... ...or you'll go yourselfto fell the taiga. And I'll give yourwife and pretty daughter... ...to the soldiers, to the Cossacks... for fun. Got it, you fool?. Get out of here, you Lithuanian duke. Get out of here! Sweetheart... what are you doing here?. What's going to happen?. Nothing, child, nothing. Everything will come right. You don't believe that yourself... I'm afraid... There's nothing to be afraid of, I'll take care of everything. I promise. No you won't, Father. I see what's happening. I see who's fighting the war, who's shooting innocent villagers. We need help. What help?. Our neighbours are all hiding in their little estates. They have mass said every day... ...to pray that I'll be enough to satiate the soldiers. There's not going to be any help. Yes therewill... What?. It'stime to remember old debts. ToTadas! -ToTadas...-ToTadas! - Butwhere's Blinda's beer?. - Here's Blinda's beer... Tadas... That's bloody good beer... To victory,Tadas... What kind ofvictory is this, Motiejus?. Come on, don't be such a bore. We kicked their asses... So, and what now?. What of it?. Who are we going to fightwith?. What do you mean with who?. Once we're done with these, we'll take on the masters. We'll take away all their gold. Give it to the serfs. And we'll keep the horses for ourselves. Motiejus... You know, my father once told me - steal one horse, and they'll call you a horse thief for a hundred years. What do you need that for?. We gave these a beating, but more will come, and then more. Today there's 30 of them, but tomorrow there'll be 300... ...and the next day - 3,000. The czar doesn't have 3,000... Motiejus, you blockhead. Me - look at yourself. Just a few days ago you were running around... ...with a potato sackon your head. And now you're a honcho. So your ass is burning with envy?. Go to hell... Tadas, someone's come from Luoke. Says there's important news. Who's therewith Blinda?. From Luoke, brought some news... Look - Blinda's with a lad as if it was a dame... God damn... I still can't beliieve it... Your men are making the whole forest shake... ...only a blind man would have trouble finding you. Rebels... We're not rebels, Kristina. So what's happened?. Get out of here... Butwhat if someone finds out... So make sure no one does. You said you'd do anything for me. Sometimes... ...friends become enemies and enemies become friends. And there's only one way to recognise them. How? To feel it... ...right here. You serf, you. So you thinkyou can set a horse into the forest and save your hide?. I'm counting to three. One... ...two... All right! Just don't... shoot... All right, I'll tell you everything, just don't shoot. Come out of there! What's in it for me?. I'll leave you alive! I couldn't give a shit about a life like this! Come on out of there! Couldn't give a flying shit. All right, I'm coming. That's it, I'm coming. I'm coming. Just don't shoot. Well. Come out and talk. I'm glad your soldiers didn't shoot me from a distance... I was already afraid that I was riding myself into a trap. This devilry has to stop. Well, I wasn't the one who let the devil out of the bottle... I know... I diid. Stop fooling around, Adam... I said, get out of theway... You're lying! As I love God... My father died hunting! Oh, right... Let's go, brother...! No, brother! The currentwas too strong! No, brother! Adam, for the love of God, they're just children... What damn children. My Janek is a child.

So what are we going to do now?. Oh... shit... Wait... I'll tell you... Thankyou. Go. Go... Why do I always have to save your ass?. Because I have a grade-A ass. My ass... is golden! For freedom...
