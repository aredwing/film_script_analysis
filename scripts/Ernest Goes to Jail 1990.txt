This ain't no pink champagne Doin' time This is a ball and chain Doin' time This ain't no swank hotel Doin' time This is a mile-wide hell If it don't fit the crime How come you get off, and I'm doin' time? Somebody bake me a cake You'd better sneak in a file You'd better buy me a judge I've been set up, and I'm doin' time This ain't no pink champagne Doin' time This is a ball and chain Doin' time This ain't no swank hotel Doin' time This is a mile-wide hell Honey, please don't leave me hangin' here Can't you see the end is near? Its a crime You get off, and I'm doin' time Bobby, run! Hold it! Red light! Green light! Go! Okay, go! Lets go! Red light. Green light. Did you hear that? It came from over there. Locked. Freeze! Oh, hi, fellas. Hi. Ernest, how many times do I have to tell you about bank procedure? Do you realize you could've caused a serious accident here, perhaps even a blood bath? This man is a coiled cobra ready to strike at the slightest irregularity. I'm sorry, fellas. - - I-I just got to workin' on this old polisher switch, and I just forgot. Okay. I'm gonna let you off this time because you're one of us and you work at the bank. Yeah. But I won't always have this job. Someday I'll be able to wield the financial muscle of this institution. I'll be able to move assets around like chessmen on a financial chessboard. Someday corporate managers will shudder in their wingtips at my approach, for I will be... a bank clerk. Aah! Ow! Ow! A- A-A-A-A-Ah! Aah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Bob, I'm sick of this police band. Lets listen to something with kick to it! Yeah! Help! Chuck! Ouch! Aah! Oh! It won't turn off! Help! Help! Help! Aah! Don't make me climb These aren't my tree-climbing shoes Stop! Stop! Huh? Whoa! You can't go up the wa-a-a-a-ll! Ow! Ow! Aah! Aah! ... tree-climbing shoes Uh... Huh? Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Yaa! Yaa! Uh! Uh! Uh! Yaa! Yaa! Aaaaah! Anyway, man, monkeys have been up there Yes, put that down! Put that down! Ah heh heh heh heh heh. Huh? What? Uh! My hands are stuck! I'm doomed! Aah! Security check five. No problem. Man: There has been a breach in security. All prisoners, return to your cellblocks. Hey, you! Mr. Nash, you got to help me. I just killed a guy. What about it? You got to help me! I help no one who can't help me. Its your mess, Rubin. You clean it up. Mr. Nash, you... you got to do something! Help me! Good morning, Frank. Morning, Chuck. Did you have a problem last night? N-Nothing we couldn't handle. Oh. Not again today. You might as well go ahead and, uh, show him some kind of I.D., Miss Sparrow. I have to, and I'm his brother. What in the Sam Hill do you think you're doin'? Ernest? Ernest! Oh. What happened? Uh... uh, I-I was just guardin' the money... you know, bein' extra careful, uh, walkin' that extra mile. Ernest, this is the biggest mess you've ever made. If Mr. Pendlesmythe sees this... It wasn't my fault. They followed me in here. It was awful. You can't imagine... especially these two. Ernest, whatever happened, you've got to clean it up now. Come on. I'll help you. Did you read those books that I gave you? I tried, but they were real tough. There weren't any pictures, and the print was real small. Ernest, you've got to work hard if you want to get ahead. I know, but I get discouraged. And besides, Mr. Pendlesmythe's not gonna give me a chance. Ernest, you got to believe in yourself. Y-You've got to have faith in the system. You're right, Charlotte. After all, I am Ernest P. Worrell, an upwardly mobile American at his best, and I know that if I pay my taxes, bathe, and floss regularly, I will ascend the ladder of success, hand over foot. Ernest, do you think the floor needs a polish? Come on. Walk this way. Come on. Two minutes for me, man. Man: Attention to cellblock... exercise time is over in five minutes. Today's your deadline, Eddie. I want that money you owe me. I'm sorry, Mr. Nash. I just need a little more time. Not good enough, Eddie. Lyle... See if you can help Eddie with his attitude. I'll get it for you. I swear. Oh, I know that, Eddie. The question is when. Tomorrow... I'll get it for you tomorrow. Today's your deadline. I hate to encourage tardiness. Please... I'll get it for you tonight. I swear. See that you do, Eddie. See that you do. There. All cleaned up. That should pass Mr. Pendlesmythe's inspection. Right you are, Charlotte. And Mr. Poodlesmurf is lucky to have me on his team. As a matter of fact, one of these days, I'm gonna walk into that office, and I'm gonna say... - "Oscar, babe..." - What? Uh, good morning, Mr. Puddlesmoot... Smiddlepit... Smooglepoot... Pendlesmythe, you idiot! Uh, yes, sir. Can't you get anything right? Why are you such a screw-up? Ernest, you've got to be more careful. I know. I'll never get to be a clerk. I'll be lucky if they let me stay on as a janitor, know what I mean? Hey, maybe I can help you with that promotion. All you need is a little more self-confidence. You're right, Charlotte. I need to think more positive. I need to think... I'll get that job. Why, that man is putty in my fingers. I'm just toyin' with him now, like a kitten with a June bug. I was just thinking that, uh, - Yeah, like a... - Since you're not working tomorrow that maybe we could get together, talk about the job, maybe have dinner. Dinner? Did you say "dinner"... like just the two of us in the same town on the same day in the same restaurant, possibly at the same table? Well, yes, but... just as friends, right? I mean just as friends. I mean, we'll get together, we'll talk about the job. I can give you some, uh, insights based upon my experience. Experience. Oh, yeah. Well, I suggest you bring your willpower, young woman. Be forewarned... the Worrell charm is merciless. Oh, sure, Charlotte. You just want to show me... the ropes. You just want to give me a leg up to the bottom rung of that little ladder called "success." Oh, yeah. Come on, Rimshot. We have to choose just the right ensemble. No. Too formal for dinner. Ah, the perfect choice... European styling with a decidedly American flair. Charlotte has more than a professional interest in yours truly. And who can blame her? I've never understood why I have such a profound effect on women, but why argue with success? Yeah, I'm a man who has just found his parking space in the fast lane. Who knows what lies ahead for such a man? Aah-aah-aah-aah! Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah-aah! Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah-aah! Aah-aah-aah! Ahhhhhh... Wh-o-o-o-oa! Uh! Well, there's my problem right there. Looks like this little wire's got a little sh... ...hhhhhhhhhhhhh... ...ort in it. Gosh! Not again. Woman: Oh! Bonsoir. Dinner for two? Right. I'll be your waiter this evening. You may call me Philippe. I'll just give you a moment to look over your menu. I had a long talk with Mr. Pendlesmythe today. It took a lot of convincing, but he agreed to accept your application for the clerk's job. He did? But the thing is... y-you've got to be more careful. I just know I can win him over. We'll have that little talk around the old water cooler about... team sports and transmissions, jock itch... things that just guys talk about, know what I mean? I'll have him eatin' Right out of the palm of my hand. I know that its hard, Ernest, But Mr. Pendlesmythe can't stand mistakes. And between you and I, I don't think he can stand people, either. Oh, thats okay. I'm not like other people, know what I mean? Frankly, Ernest, I don't even know why you want the job. I mean, he's a horrible man to work for. At least where you are now, you only have to see him once a day. Want to hear something really funny? - - I thought I was gonna get promoted to branch manager this time last year. What a laugh, huh? Y-Yeah, but did you hear the one about the 3-legged dog That walked into the saloon and said, "I'm lookin' for the guy that shot my 'paw"'? Ah heh heh heh heh. Ernest, this is fun. I mean, you're pretty good company. I come from a long line of bon vivants. We're known for our charm, wit, and sparkling dinner conversation, know what I mean? Ernest? Ernest, are you all right? I recommend the lobster. Ah heh heh. Ah heh heh heh. Sir. Man: There he is. Hey, warden, we don't come to your house. Open C-12. Well, well, well. If it isn't the infamous Mr. Nash. My sources tell me that you and your guard dog got in some trouble yesterday down in the weight room. Just mindin' my own business, warden, somethin' you might want to try sometime. Now, you can make things easy on yourself, or you can make 'em hard. Its up to you. You hear me, Nash?! Yeah, I hear you, warden. Now you hear me. When you step out of that cozy little office, you're on my turf. And if I were you, I would watch my step. If thats a threat, its a weak one. Your day's comin' real soon, Nash... and we both know it. Man: Close C-12. I've got to get out of this place. Chuck: Ernest, you wouldn't believe the new security system we have for the van... maximum protection and minimum carnage... And three levels of power! Ernest, I... Thanks, Chuck. Thanks, Bobby. I'm not finished talkin' to you about this! This is really neat! Here, Rimshot. Here, boy. Thats a good boy. How you been? Miss your daddy? Good boy. Lets see what we got in the mail. All right! Down you go. Wow! This is great! I don't believe it! Jury duty! Look, Rimshot! I've been chosen for jury duty! This is great! Chuck! Bobby! Chuck! Bobby! Alley-oop. Uh-oh. I hate this minefield. Its a miracle! I'm so happy! I'm ecstatic! Uh, uh, its a dream come true! Chuck, Bobby, guess what! Ernest, you're in the line of fire! Move it! Go! Pick 'em up, put 'em down! Go! Go! Go! I hate this part! Ow! I'm the luckiest guy in the whole world. They chose me. Out of hundreds of thousands of other people, they chose me for United States jury duty. Isn't that great? Yeah, great. Bobby, soup's on! I mean, the opportunity to decide... right or wrong, good or evil, regular or unleaded, to hold a man's life in the palm of my hand and decide, "Should I crush it... or allow it to go free like a bird on the wings of time?" Burn him. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, one of the most precious guarantees in our Constitution is that of a fair trial. Every defendant has the right to one. This defendant is no exception. It is you who must decide his case, not I. You must weigh the evidence carefully. Counselor, you may proceed. Thank you, your honor. Ladies and gentlemen, the state will prove that the defendant, Rubin Bartlett, who is a known henchman of the notorious crime czar and bank robber Felix Nash, did, in fact, murder - - A fellow prisoner while in jail. And for this, the state asks that you extend his remaining time of five months into a sentence of life without parole. Ladies and gentlemen, the defense will show that the deceased was not killed by my client. In fact, he wasn't killed by anyone. He died as the result of a tragic accident, when, in a poorly lit stairwell, he tripped over an inadequately placed railing and plunged, regrettably, to his death. If there is a guilty party in this case, it must surely be the system, to allow such unsafe conditions to exist. Once you've heard the evidence, I'm sure you'll agree with me that the charges against my client, Mr. Bartlett, are completely spurious, and that you will find him... not guilty. Ah heh heh heh. Excuse me, sir. Are you all right? Uh, just fine, thank you. This guy looks exactly the same as Nash. Are you crazy? I... look, the guy's perfect. Its downright uncanny. We can't just... It'll work. It will. Your honor... to allow the jury to fully understand the case for the defense, we feel as though its imperative that they see the environment within which this unfortunate accident occurred. Therefore, we move that these proceedings be continued to the site of the alleged crime. Well, I find this request highly irregular. However, if the prosecution has no objections... Prosecutor: Uh, no objections, your honor. So be it. These proceedings will reconvene tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. At the Dracup Correctional Facility. Oh, boy! A field trip! I'm telling you... this guy is right on the numbers. Its so simple. Towel. We make the switch, you get in on the jury and find me innocent, then you walk away a free man, and I make sure this guy Ernest gets whats coming to you. In and out... wham, bam... and its over. Yeah. I'm a real big fan of the early release program. Attorney: I would like to thank the members of the jury for bearing with us. Dracup Prison is... Okay, Lyle, we got one shot at this, so make it count. ... there are those that must endure its reality. So, what we are here to talk about today... is death... horrible... frightening, something to be avoided. But is death murder? Is murder death? I think not. And yet, though we must feel some sympathy for the victim, we cannot... Psst! By wrongfully accusing... And that, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly what... The state has made no case. Psst! They've presented no compelling evidence. Come here, you. Why? Because there is none... Am I me? Nash: Come here. Huh? We don't dispute that. Of course, all of us, as reasonable human beings, mourn them... Ugh! Attorney: Certainly... Hurry up, Lyle. And keeping this in mind, I would like to move these proceedings to the staircase... Man: Right this way, please. Heh heh heh. All right, Rubin, lets go. Nash! Wake up! No napping during exercise period. No talking. Yes, sir, officer, whatever you say. Boy, this is great! A brief workout to gather our thoughts, then its off to the jury room to decide... very ingenious. And they even gave us these nifty workout clothes. Boy, I love jury duty, don't you? Whatever you say, Mr. Nash. Oh, you don't have to be so formal. You can just call me Ernest, Ernest P. Worrell. Hey! You know the rules. No talking. Yes, sir. Kind of strict, aren't they? Man: Cellblock B-29, move to the left. The rest of you, move... Man 2: "C" to the left, "D" to the right. Ah, lunch... how thoughtful. For the mind to work, the body must have fuel. A lot of jurors here today. There must be a lot of trials going on... a sad commentary on our disintegrating society, know what I mean? Man: All right, brace it up. Oh, uh, I don't think our table has any steak sauce. Get up! I-I'm sorry. Where are my manners? I should have waited for the others. Eat, greaseball! I didn't order greaseball. Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Man: All right, stand to the back. Backs against the wall. Open up "C" block. - - All right, lets move it! Come on, come on, come on, lets go. Ernest: We're sequestered, a- and on top of that, we can't even leave. Oh, this is great. This is just great. Uh! I hope you've got a good story to tell my boss. After all, I do have a living to earn. Now, look, Nash... My name is Worrell, Ernest P. Worrell. Oh, Mr. Funny Man, huh? Yeah, Mr. Funny Man, you'll think funny when you're tapping to the tune of 220, son! That is the rudest bailiff I have ever seen in my life. Ugh! Oh! Wait a minute. Ooh! Oh! Man: Hey, come on, knock it off! You're that guy. Bailiff! Bailiff! You're in big trouble now, pal. Bailiff! What is it, Nash? You see that guy? Yeah. So? No, I mean look... look at him. Come closer. Look. You see that guy? He's not on the jury. This man is a prisoner. I ought to throw you in the hole for that, Nash! - The hole? - Yeah, the hole! The hole, like... like in solitary, the hole... like in real prison, like in real, really, really, really, really, really real prison? The hoosegow, the slammer, the joint, alcatraz, San Quentin, Sing Sing... Oh, no, I... I'm in... I'm in... jai-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-I! Jail! Ha ha ha ha ha. Your honor, we have reached a decision. We find the defendant, Rubin Bartlett, not guilty. Have you... carefully weighed the evidence? Yes, we have, your honor. The defendant, found not guilty, will return to the state penitentiary, where he will complete his previous sentence. Mm-hmm. Good night. Lets go! Ernest, we're late for work, and Mr. P. Does not appreciate tardiness. So, how'd it go, Mr. Juror? Now, on to the real important question... how did your date go? Oh, we had a nice time. Nice time? Now, whats the deal with the hair? You bringing the wet look back? I'm just trying something new. Oh. Where's your, uh, where's your sky piece, you know, your lid, your brown cap? I never see you without that brown cap. I must've lost it somewhere. Bobby... ...there's something bad wrong here. This guy... This guy... is in love... L-U-V! Ernest is in love! Ha ha ha ha! Ernest and Charlotte, sittin' in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G First comes love and then comes marriage Then comes Ernest pushing a baby carriage Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Chuck: Ernest, you're not gonna believe this, but we have a new security system at the bank. A bank? I work in a bank? Lets go! Man: Close "C" block. Look, look, I tell you... I'm not this guy Nash. If you're not Mr. Nash, how come you look like him? Because he's obviously a very attractive criminal. Yeah, thats right, too. Lyle, tell him who I am. Man: Hey, Mr. Nash, did he fall for it? Thats real funny, Mr. Nash. Open up C-12. Did you miss me, Mr. Nash? Close it up. You! You know I'm not Nash. Of course you are... Ernest. You've got nothing to worry about. I'll make sure this thing plays just the way we laid it out. Just make sure everything stays in line on your end. I've got another deal working here, and there'll be a cut in it for you. That idiot you switched me for has a job in a bank. I don't believe it. Sometimes the cards just fall your way. Yeah. You just make sure nobody figures out that idiot isn't me. Listen, little man, you've pushed me as far as you're going to. I've got some big things riding, and if you know whats good for you, you'll play ball. O-Oh, great! What position? You do like we say, or Lyle here will break your back... Like that. Well, then he'll just have to break my back like... like that thing you guys did. Real men are not intimidated by physical threats against their personal selves, and ironically, neither am I. What about violence against other people? What do you mean? I mean, while you're being Mr. Nash in here, Mr. Nash is being you out there. Yeah, he's living your life, working at your job at the bank, hanging out with your friends, and if you don't behave, he may have to get very strict with someone you really care about. Charlotte? No! That your girl? Well, sort of. Well, she's gonna "sort of" be dead if you don't play along. You lay one finger on her, and I'll... Hey, relax. She'll be all right as long as you behave. Okay, what do I have to do? You've got to be Nash. Okay, Lyle, this guy Nash, he's a tough guy, right, he's a gangster. Okay, how about this? You dirty rat, you're the guy that shot my brother, and I'm the guy thats gonna shoot you. Y-You dirty rat, y-you're the guy that, eh, eh, shot my brother, and I'm the guy thats gonna shoot you... every goddang one of you. Too old, huh? Hey, yo, Murdock, you're the guy that shot my brother, right, and I'm the guy thats gonna shoot you, eh? All right. Of all the gin joints in all the cities in all the world, you've got to waltz into my place and shoot my brother. Play it, Sam. The piano will cover up the shot. Why, you dirty rat, you're the guy that shot my brother, and I'm the guy thats gonna shoot you. Why, you're the dirty, scum-suckin' pig dog that shot my brother... And I'm the man who's going to destroy you... 'Cause I'm just that kind of guy. How 'bout that? Hey, what are you doing here? Uh, oh, I was just, uh... Well, at least you're not in the vault. What would I be doing in the vault? Who knows why you're there every morning? Yeah, right. Well, how do I get in there, you suppose? I don't know. Hey, whats the matter with your voice? You sound different. Oh, I've got a little laryngitis. Hmm, I'm sorry. Hey, I wouldn't let Mr. Pendlesmythe catch me in his chair if I were you, and I'd get my feet off his desk because you know how he feels about his famous golf trophy. Yeah. You know, by the way, I had a real nice time the other night. I think it was really good for me to just get away from work and just have some fun. Yeah, I had a nice time, too, baby. "Baby"? Ernest, sometimes you can be so weird. Good morning, Miss Sparrow. Good morning. And what are we doing behind the bank presidents desk? I was just gonna leave you a note. About what? About, um... Uh, Ernest wants to formally apply for that clerk's job. Yeah, yeah, thats it. Ha. I see... Ernest the clerk. Hmm. What a great idea. Well, now you don't have to leave a note, do you? So get out from there! Whats the matter with your hair? Is that some sort of punk thing, huh? I was just trying something new. Just look at you. You are a poor excuse for a member of the human race. You and that big nose and ugly face have caused so much trouble around here, I should be given a medal for tolerating you. I would choose my words differently if I were you. Oh? Should I use smaller ones? How 'bout this? No! Now get out of my office, both of you! Oh, I'm sorry, Ernest. He promised he wasn't gonna do that. Well... well, who cares what he thinks anyway? I'm really proud of you for trying. I mean, you're starting to take stock of yourself. When you were in there talking to Mr. Pendlesmythe, it was as if you were a whole different person. What do you mean? Well, I-I mean that I'm proud of you. Ernest, do you have any idea how long you've made me and Bobby wait in that van? 7.5 minutes. I want to tell you something about time. My time is worth money, and I don't think you make that kind of money to pay me for my time. Now, lets put the hammer down. Okay, today will be your first test as Mr. Nash. Don't worry, fellas, you are talking to a consummate actor, a brilliant interpreter of character and nuance, a professional practitioner in the style and method of the great Stradivarius. Man: Bring the sheets back over in the corner. Just pile them up. Yeah, just throw 'em anywhere. Man 2: Hey, Jesus, don't over stuff the machine again. Man 3: Hey, Bill, we need more starch over here. Man 4: All right, come on. You got something on your shirt? Ah heh heh heh heh. Today's the day, Nash. My boy's ready. Not now, Vinny. Mr. Nash doesn't have anything to prove. Everybody's waiting. You're not gonna chicken out now, are you? I don't know the meaning of the word "chicken." Man: If you lose this one, Nash, we're gonna run things. I know you've never lost, Nash... yet, but my man Spider here is gonna change all that. Okay? - Go! - Grrr! Ernest: Wait a minute! I wasn't even ready! Thats not fair! Listen, where I come from, mister, you're supposed to say, "Ready, set, go." Thats the official way, and I want a rematch. Nash, you're a glutton for punishment. You're in way over your head, man. They're gonna figure you out. He was just lucky. I can take this guy. Man: Okay, here we go. Ready... set... go! Come on, man! Come on, baby! Come on, Spider! Come on, baby! Come on, Spider! Come on, man! Right there, right there, right there! Come on, Spider. Come on, baby. Smoke? Man: Aw, man! That was close. Next case. Man, why don't you shut your mouth? The real Mr. Nash don't say much. Well, maybe he ought to, right? I mean, after all, I'm just reaching for the character. What do you know about the pain an actor must go through... You straighten up, or I'll show you pain, and don't you forget your loved ones on the outside. Chuck: Ernest, Ernest, we're sorry. Bobby didn't know the mace can was loaded. Bobby, how many times do I have to tell you... Yuh! Get off me, you mutt! Get out of here! This is pathetic. This guy's better off in jail. Whoa! Ugh! Ugh! Oof! Eee! I will effect my escape using a bar of soap, a common, ordinary household spoon, and a tin of shoe polish. Thank goodness I paid attention in art class. Don't worry, Charlotte, I'll save you. Your hero is on his way. Hey, screw! Yeah, you! Come here! What now, Nash? Open the door or I'll waste ya. Ah heh heh heh heh. Assault rifle on a rope, the perfect gift for the mercenary who has everything. Ah ha ha ha ha. Ah ha. Man: Shut up! Chuck: Mr. P.! Mr. P., could I have just one moment of your time, sir, please? I want to introduce you to our latest arsenal in the war against crime. Look... Eh! Mr. P., its very, very special. Well... all right, but I'm late for dinner. Great. You'll eat. Just follow me, please, sir. Okay, can I have you here, please? Thank you. You won't be needing this. Lets... lets go. Lets open up. Open up. Thank you. Bobby... Please. Mr. P., do you have that funny, little acidy taste in the back of your throat... like that? Uh-huh. Can you taste it? Do you know what that is? Unh-unh. Fear. Thats what your common, class-X criminal would be feeling at this moment if he were in your situation. - Oh. - Bobby... its only a simulation. - - I don't think I'd touch those bars, Mr. P., unless you want 200,000 volts of electricity jolting through your body. Think about that. Bobby... Mr. P., uh, have a nice dinner and a... and a good nights sleep... sir. Eh, he's had a real hard day. Ernest: Don't worry, Charlotte, I'll soon be flying into your arms with my superior knowledge of mathematics and geometry. The square root and angle of your lower hypotenuse times the angle of your pi... and that sort of thing. Let the countdown begin. 3... 2... 11/2... 1... 3/4... zero... fire! Whaaaaa! You see, casting is all in the wrist. Its a sport of kings, a game of inches. And as soon as your game fish takes the bait, 'tis important to give the line a sharp tug in order to set the hook, and then quickly reel it in. Ha ha ha ha! Ah heh heh heh heh heh. I was gonna throw it back, honest. Nooo! That ought to hold ya. Don't you have anything in a pastel blue? Accessories are so important. Accessories! The way they run this institution is an outrage for a poor, tired, old, lonely woman like me, her only son a felon, though not a terribly successful one. Young man... Young man. Young man, could you please open that gate? I left my car running outside. Ma'am, can you tell me how you got through this gate? The visitors' area is on the other side of the prison. I brought him up as best I could, but sometimes a bad seed falls from even the most fragile flower. Ma'am, you're not going through this gate. Is this the way you treat your mother? Is this the kind of abuse that poor woman must endure? Well, I guess my mother is a little bit mad... Mm-hmm. You ought to be in the slammer with the rest of these misfits. If you had any remorse at all for the horror you put your own mother through, you'd open that gate. I have a car overheating as we speak. Okay, okay! Lets open the east gate! There, now are you satisfied? I'll tell your mother how her son has improved despite his shaded and somewhat checkered past. The doctor told me I'd only have to wear these until after the surgery. Oh! Oh! Oh! - - Ernest, since you're part of the night family here at the bank, I'm gonna show you something new. You see that? That is only to be used during an officer-in-distress situation. Do you understand? Which, I might add, we hope will be few and far between. What could happen in a quiet, little bank like this? Eh... will you take the edge off, Bobby? I mean... Hey, Bobby! If I was going by the book, I wouldn't have said anything, but its only Ernest! Ha ha ha! He... Bobby! Well, Mr. Nash, how's our special prisoner? Just fine, thanks. Of course, the place could be a little homier. Maybe some curtains... I don't need nothin' from nobody. I especially don't need nothin' from no lousy screws. Tough guy... right to the end, huh, Nash? Just about 24 hours to go. Well, yeah, whats it to you, warden? Besides, I'll be getting out of here soon. Yeah, you'll be getting out all right... horizontally. Man: Close cellblock "C." Did you hear that? I'll be getting out in 24 hours. You just have to know how to talk to these people. Don't worry, Rubin, I'll put in a good word for you, too. Mr. P. Mr. P. Can I talk... wait, wait. Hey, can I... can I talk to you for just one second? What is it now? Lets go this way, please. Mr. P., I want to talk to you about laser beams... little bundles of light that can actually trigger a high-tech, state-of-the-art security device. Bobby... please. So? Whats the matter with it? Pbht! Nothin'! Thats the beauty of it. Now, Mr. P., could I just have your attention this way, please, sir? Please, Mr. P., come this way. Ohh. Oooh. Space-age plastics at work for you, Mr. P. Its invisible, tasteless, odorless, colorless. And the best news yet, sir... its bulletproof. Bobby, if you... please! No! Uhhhh. Uh, y... Its got a few bugs there, Mr. P., but you get the basic idea, right? Help me get this off of him. Mr. P.'s a very rich and busy man. Ernest: 24 hours, Lyle. I'm outta here in 24 hours, and, boy, am I ever glad. This hasn't been a really bad experience, though. I mean, the food's good, and I met a lot of new friends. But now I'm ready to go back to my job and my dog. You know, I got a feeling everything's gonna turn out all right from now on. You know, Lyle, its really good to be alive. Whats bothering him? Ernest, I can't believe this. This place is spotless. I am so proud of you. Has the value of pride diminished? What? Well, the last time you were proud of me, I got a kiss. Mr. Pendlesmythe: Ernest, I want to see you in my office. Well, Ernest, you've made a drastic improvement in your job performance. And so I've decided to take Miss Sparrow's recommendation. You'll be joining us working days as a bank clerk. So, Ernest, do you have anything to say? Mr. Pendlesmythe: You idiot! You smashed my golf trophy! Get out of here! Gosh, Mr. Pendlesmythe, does this mean I don't get the job? "Don't get the job"? I may have you shot! Ernest... Did you see his face? You didn't do that on purpose? He'll get over it. Ernest, what has gotten into you? Look, we got to talk. Okay. How 'bout tonight? But it'll have to be early. Why? You have a lot to clean? Yeah. Tonight I'm gonna clean out the whole place. Man: Open C-12. Warden: Nash, your lawyer's got something to tell you. I'm afraid I've got some bad news, Mr. Nash. Our last appeal was turned down. It was our final hope. I'm afraid there's nothing more we can do. Come on, Nash. Lets go. Go? Go where? You're going to the row. The row? Well, whats that? As in death. You know, death row. Oh, well... death row?! You mean like the chair? The hot seat? Dead meat, deep six, its over, pal, you're outta here, bub, the groundhogs are bringing your mail, you're picking turnips with a stepladder, like the no-tomorrow row, that kind of row? Oh, no. The row?! Uh, but, uh... You've got to tell them who I am, fellas. I'm Ernest P. Worrell. I'm not Nash. I'm Ernest. Zip it up, Nash. Get him outta here. Warden, you're gonna feel terrible when you find out what a big mistake you made. And, you, pal, you're not getting any more of my business. I'm not Nash, I tell you. I'm Ernest. I'm Ernest P. Worrell. Close "C" block. Come in. Two hearts racing toward love... Two lips trembling... Ernest, this wasn't what I expected. Its, um, i-its different. Have a drink. Oh. Okay, sure. Why not? Uh, sit down. Make yourself more comfortable. ... Burning in the night... A toast... to the successful completion of all of tonights endeavors. To a long and happy life. I'm up for that. Um, Ernest, I-I didn't come here to have... I was... just wanted to speak to you about what happened at the bank today. We can talk later. Ernest. Ernest, stop it! What has gotten into you?! - Stop it! Get off me! Get away from me, you mangy little mutt! You are slimers, P. Worrell! Here, you little rat ball. So its come to this. A pointless, miserable end to a shallow, meaningless life. But its as it should be. Its the hand I've been dealt, and I have to play it as it lays. Oh, I'm not going to cry because life's thrown me a curve. I'm... I'm not going to whine because I got mashed potatoes when French fries is what I really wanted. Its time for me to... step up to the plate, belly up to the bar! Its time for me to look fate square in the eye, flare my nostrils, breathe life's last breath! Its time for me to lie down with lions so I can soar with the eagles! All right! I'm ready! Come and get me! Lets do it! Come on, Nash. Its time. I don't wanna die. Is it fixed yet? No. Would you like a cigarette or a blindfold or something? No, I'm afraid of the dark, and cigarettes will kill you. Maybe a few last words. Nash, take it like a man. But I'm not Nash. I'm Ernest. "And what is an Ernest?" You might ask. A man with a past rich in both history and tradition. Should we punish this man for crimes he did not commit? No, no, no, no, no, no. Can't you speed things up? Okay, okay. Such a man should be set... free. Oh! Hit the alarm! Run for it! Lets go! Whats wrong with the door?! Whoa! Thanks, Nash! Man: There's been a breach in security. All guards to your emergency stations. Hey, whats going on here?! All prisoners, return to your cells. Return to your... Lets go, Lyle. Get outta my way! There he is! Stop him! Fire! All: Aaahhhhh! Come on! Get outta here! Come on! Lets go! Lets go! Lets go! Cut him down now! It worked before. All: Aaahh! Ahh! Diii-ha! Yihaw! Yihaw! Yiiiihaww! Yihaw! Ahh! Open sesame. Not so fast. You better watch out, Rubin. I'll zot you. You're a dead man, Worrell. Very well. You asked for it. After all, I am Ernest P. Worrell, Electroman. Did I ever tell you that you have a really classic Greek profile? Shut up. Let him go. Lyle, you talk. Thats great. Have you flipped? Come on. We got to get rid of this guy before he blows the whole thing. No, he's different than us. Shut up and get out of my way. You better go. Mr. Nash is probably robbing the bank right now. Nash? Well, come with me. I don't belong out there. I got a place in here. Well, I'm gonna miss you, good buddy. Ernest, things won't be the same without you, you know what I mean? If anybody does... So long, Lyle! I'll send you a cake! There he is! Come on! All right! We got ya! Come on, Lyle. Back inside. Don't let him get away. Get the dogs! Come on! Move it! Nobody has ever escaped from this facility since I've been warden, and they're not gonna start now. All right, lets go, men. Consider the prisoner extremely dangerous. What are you doing now, Ernest? Thats it. Is everyone who works here a moron? Can't you see what I'm doing? I'm robbing the bank. I'm gonna blow the safe, take the money, and leave. I'm robbing the bank. I'm stealing the money that you are paid to protect. I'm robbing the bank. Ppbbhhtt! I've been vandalized... by Elvis. I can't believe it! I can't believe it! First Ernest and now this! I am acting like the victim again. I need to tell Ernest exactly how I feel, and I need to do it right now while I'm still mad! Ah. Thats better. Rimshot. Rimshot. Here, boy. Rimshot? Rimshot. Rimshot? Rimshot? Rimshot? Rimshot. Rimshot! How did you get in there? What kind of a person would throw away a perfectly good dog? Come on, Rimshot. Lets go. Don't you worry about your diet, chubby. As soon as I set this fuse, you're gonna lose all that weight. Mr. Pendlesmythe, its Charlotte. I-I know you won't believe this, but it looks like Ernest is robbing the bank. I know, but I am here right now. Look, I don't know whats gotten into you, but you can't go through with this! Ernest! Ernest! Look... I am not this Ernest guy. I just happen to look like him. I switched with him, you get it? You what? Look, would the real Ernest have been able to knock out Chuck or set a time bomb without it going off in his face? And look at the floors. Did you notice how clean they've been lately? You are an imposter. What did you do with the real Ernest? Where is he? He's dead by now. What do you mean he's dead? I don't believe you! What have you done with him?! I haven't done anything with him. Your dedicated public servants down in the state pen put him in the chair hours ago. Well, I'll be seeing you, sweetheart. Or rather, I'll be seeing parts of you. Ha ha ha ha. Parts of you... ha ha ha ha ha! Shh. Rimshot, don't say a word. Uh... uh. Charlie! Ow! Chuck: Thats it. Get him in position. Ow! Chuck! Ow! Whats gotten into you, Chuck? Its me! Ow! You sure have a funny way of saying hello. Do you think I'd let you get near me after what you did to Ernest... one of the sweetest, kindest men who ever lived? Gosh, Charlotte, I-I'm touched. Okay, now, listen to me. When I give the signal, I want you to hit him with everything we've got. What? Sir, we got civilians in there. Worrell. Nash. Now, Nash, this is Warden Carmichael. Now, we've got you surrounded. Come on out with your hands up. Nash, let the hostages go. Looks like I got myself another hostage. Too bad. I thought you were dead. Not yet. So... it comes to this. Man to man, mano a mano, toe to toe, nose to nose, shirts and skins, eggs over medium. Be careful, Ernest! Ohh! Chuck: He should've ducked. Here, let me help you up. I want to show you your new desk. Stop it! - Get up. - Chuck: Yeah, stop it! I can't believe I was fooled by that man. I sensed it immediately. Freeze, punk. Make your play. Chuck: All right, Bobby! Burn him! What are you waiting for?! Burn him! Bobby! The gun! Get away from there. Nash: Give me that gun or I'll rip your lungs out. Give it here! Chuck: Bobby, go to plan 12! Let go! Let go. Ohhh. Warden: You haven't got a prayer, Nash. You're completely surrounded. Give it up. Chuck: Bobby! What do you want me to do now? Deploy them around to the back. Okay, second team, lets move. You heard him! Lets go! Toast time. It looks like one way or another, this was just his night to fry. I'm floating. I'm lighter than air. Whats happening to me? He's polarized. He... he's weightless. Gravity's lost its grip. I'll show you polarized. Ahhhhhhhh! - Time to put your butt on spin cycle. - Ahhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhhhhh! Right down the middle. Ahhhhh! Ahhhhhhh! Oh, no! No! No! No! Ugh! Ugh! Chuck! Bob...! Chuck! Bob...! - Stop it! - Doh! Uhhhhh! Oh! Uhhhhh! Oh! Oh! Ow! Oh! Nash: To the moon, bozo! Leave him alone! Uh! Chuck: Ernest, you're in control! Thats it! Nash, listen to me. Let the hostages go. Yeah, right, warden. This'll take care of him. Ernest, incoming. 3:00. Maybe 2:30. 50... 3/4... Uh, uh, uh, uh. Ahhhhhhh! Wa-ahhhhhhhh! Get this thing off of me. Watch out, Ernest! He's getting up! Aaaahhhhhh! Chuck: Ernest, grab the lamp! Be careful. Those lamps are expensive. Go back to plan "B." I'm gonna kill him. Ahh! Huh? W-Whats going on in there? Get your head down! Who is this guy? Its my bank. Peter Pan, eat your heart out. Here. Have a seat. Ahhhhhh! Ugh! Ahhhhhhhhh! Ernest: Let go of me! Pull on it! Pull on it! Chuck! I am. My wrist is beginning to chafe. Ernest! Stop this thing! Somebody, stop... Nash: Come on, get me off of this thing! Hey, Nash, you'll never get him now. Please be sure that your seat backs and tray tables are in their full, upright, and locked positions before landing. Let me off of this thing! Thanks for shopping with us. Ah heh heh heh heh. No, don't touch that button. No! Aaaahhhhh! All right! E-e-e-e-e-w. 15 seconds, Chuck! Bobby, unlock me! Ernest, the bomb! I'm coming. Don't worry, Charlotte. I'll save you. Give me that. Up, up, and away-y-y-y-y-y! He's getting away. Whoa! Wow! Oh... my buddy's gone. He's been here all right. I recognize his work. Ernest saved us, Mr. Pendlesmythe. He saved your stupid bank and all your stupid money. Ernest wasn't a thief. He was a hero. Well, maybe you're right. Stick a sock in it. Unh. Put 'em down, boys. Nice and easy. And all of you, move over there. Come on, move. Nash... you'll never get away with this. Oh, yeah, warden? I think so. She's my ticket outta here. Come over here, sweetie. Ahhhhhhh! Uhhhh. Uh-oh. Ernest, you're alive. I came. I saw. I got blowed up. Play it, Sam. The piano will cover up the shot. Don't make me climb the coconut tree That would be a catastrophe I would not make it halfway, you see I'm wearing the wrong kind of shoes Don't make me climb the coconut tree I think I owe you an apology But ask anyone who grew up with me I'm not one to easily bruise Don't make me climb No, don't make me climb Don't make me climb These aren't my tree-climbing shoes Hey, man, if I had known you were back, man, I wouldn't have worn my wingtips. Look, there's no tread left on these. See? Look. You can't eat those coconuts anyway, man. Monkeys have been up there. Eh, put that down! Put that down! Don't! Don't push, man. Don't make me climb. No, please don't make me climb No, don't make me climb These aren't my tree-climbing shoes Ah, don't make me climb No, don't make me climb Don't make me climb These aren't my tree-climbing shoes Wha...
