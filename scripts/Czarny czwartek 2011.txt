My friend from Gdask visited me. He talked to a soldier who said that they had come here to fight with the hitlerites. Gdynia joined in. I will go to see. I'll come to you in the evening to tell you. All right. Come! Do you want something like this? I have no authorization to proceed any combining negotiations. We understand that but we need to find a solution. I can only be an intermediary in handing over your demands. But remember - do not destroy the city. This is polish city. My name is Hulsz Edmund. I am from Dalmor. We need a reassurance that our strike is official and legal. You can see that I concede it. But remember, the soviet armada may be flowing here now. The board is not so far away and they can shoot. Consider what you are doing. Let's talk. What are your demands? When we lived near Sierakowice, he was coming back from the night shift, was sleeping three hours and was going back to work. Sometimes, where there were no trains, he was not coming home at all and was sleeping at the train station. Now, Mr Bolek, everything has changed. The way to work is short, only two train stops. We only have to pay off the apartment, buy new furniture. Do you want some more tea? Thank you, Mrs Stenia, but I have to go. We are preparing the New Years's Eve party at the ferry. - Lot's of work. Thank you! - Goodbye. All right, slowly. Look! Up... Look over there! There! That is where Dad goes to work. And there we will go... when the weather is warmer. We have signed up the agreement! Our strike is officially legal! President Mariaski promised that he would get our demands over to the deputy prime minister Kocioek. Including the one of the most important demands. An adjustment of the workers' salaries to the level of the price increases. Vivat! Where's Daddy? He is lost! Bruno! Bruno! You and your jokes! Come here, baby. Make us some food, we are hungry. Great! Bravo! GDYNIA Polish Navy headquarters - Hello! - Hello! I am looking for the City Committee secretary. I heard he is hiding here. They are all at fifteen. The first secretary is in Gdask. He is subbed by Legucki who is very scared. Have you heard what happened in Gdask? I know about the street fighting. Voivodship Committee of the party is on fire. Hello. Hello. Comrade secretary can we talk? You wanted to talk to the bandits without any authorization? Mariaski, you are finished! GDASK Voivodship Committee of the United Polish Worker's Party GDASK Board room of the Voivodship National Council Please. ALOJZY KARKOSZKA First secretary of the Voivodship Committee Comrades, let's start. There is no need to present, but please let me. of the United Polish Worker's Party There is comrade Zenon Kliszko with us today. The member of the Politbiuro of the Central Committee of our Party. In this emergency procedure we invited Karol Hajduga the deputy director from the Lenin Shipyard to this executive meeting. There were some tensions in Gdynia today, that is why comrade Hugon Malinowski - the first secretary from the City Committee of our Party - is here with us today. Can we start? Comrades, I am opening the executive's meeting. GDYNIA Strike Committee meeting Welcome! Good evening. - What are you working at? - We are writing an address. - To the workers. - Pass me the pen. Well... You're here? She is my employee. Yes, sir. I help with copying, but I do it in the handwriting. It takes a lot of time. - Don't you have the typewriter? - If I had this small from the office... It's not a problem. I will send the driver in a moment. I will tell him. Thanks. Do you want tea? - Yes, please. - Give him tea! Here is the address. Comrades, today, the situation in Gdynia was very tense, but kept under control. As you are aware, a large protest of workers of main city workplaces took place. Workers from Komuna Paryska Shipyard, Dalmor, Port and others were involved. Protest was peaceful, no vandalism acts occured. Workers called a strike committee representing them all. This committee met with the president of the Presidium of the City National Council, comrade Mariaski. Demands were presented. The worst is the situation of Navy Shipyard. OK, now comrade Karol Hajduga, please! Party members of our shipyard presents a set of claims that, when met, can relieve the situation in our shipyard. I cannot see any other measures for handling this situation other than negotiations. It is now clear to me, that Voivodship Committee and Gdask Shipyard management do not identify themselves with the Party ideals. They do not agree with the price increase and are subject to strike members pressure. That exactly is the cause for ineffectiveness of positive trends! Are your ideological compasses misaligned, comrades? Listening to your speeches, statements and assessments, one can conclude, that party members have done absolutely everything possible. Absolutely everything! Clear and simple question comes to mind: Why did these riots occur in Gdask, and not other voivodships? I can answer that question. The main cause for all this is you. You are not convinced of the necessity of price increase! Now here is comrade Hajduga, considering negotiations with the crew. There is an answer to that, comrade. You do not negotiate with the counterrevolution - you fire at the counterrevolution! Even if three hundred workers are to die - the rebellion will be crushed. Shipyard can be blown to bits, plowed and rebuilt. Shall you disagree, you may submit your party legitimacy now. You're attitude is incompatible with the party ideals! As for the price increase. No demands will be heard. And that is to be spoken clearly. By tomorrow, riots will be eliminated and peace restored. Two military divisions will enter the city. We summon you to avoid such incidents as those that took place in Gdask which resulted in bloodshed. Well... Game is over! Get the fuck out of here! Take all of them! Don't beat the girl! Faster, faster! Faster! Faster, move your ass! Faster! Don't you have eyes? You are beating your own! What is going on? Some kind of fog. As it is inside. Komuna Paryska Shipyard WEDNESDAY 16th December 1970 Stefa! Look! - Bruno, it's great! - Like new one. As soon as it runs dry, we will hang it in the kitchen. I finished. We have to give back the washing machine. I am coming. Bruno, come on! - That's you. Please come in. - Good morning. Good morning. Bruno, you know where to put it? Over there. - We are sorry, it took a little bit longer. - It doesn't matter. We would like to pay. It was two hours and a half, so it's four fifty, yes? Stenia, two hours ok. - Four zloty and it will be ok. - All right. - No more penny! - Thank you very much. GDYNIA The Presidium of the City National Council Comrade, secretary Porzycki from the Shipyard came with an urgent case. ...and those people. I recognize you comrade. - And why are you here? - We are from the Shipyard. I can see that you are from the Shipyard. You are instigators! - All of you should be put under arrest! - We came here to release the committee which was arrested, and legalized by Mr. Mariaski. Comrade Mariaski was suspended as he acted illegally - and had no right to talk to you. - Comrade secretary, the whole Shipyard crew waits for the arrested to be released. If they are not released, those people can go outside the Shipyard. Ten thousand people. What if they go outside the Shipyard? Over there, at the Shipyard, do you have the situation under the control? Not even a single peas will drop onto the tanks. Come with me, comrade. Something is going on. Go to the secretary and call the Shipyard. If we are not back in half an hour it means that we were arrested. Go! Call! And? I am with you. - They wanted to arrest you but I stopped them. - I told you! - What are we doing? - I don't know. If they are not released, people will bit us. They put the information on the speakers. They are waiting. We are going back! The army divisions and the militia entered the streets and they are there only because that the work was abandoned which resulted in acts of devastation, robbery and assaults. If we talk about this we can and we should talk about the Gdask Shipyard workers responsibility of those acts, for the destructions. We should talk about taking this responsibility. First of all, about going back to work. Not about shifting this responsibility to others. To the authority. I summon you again, shipyard workers - go back to work! There are all necessary conditions for that! It is also necessary so you can all soon celebrate Christmas and the New Year. Thank you for your attention. Good night. That was the speech of the deputy prime minister Stanisaw Kocioek. - To your coming back to work! - This is Gdask television. - We are going back to Warsaw. - Cheers! - Then, should I make you sandwiches for work tomorrow? - Sure, make some! GDYNIA Navy Headquarters - Hello. - Hello. Please, sit down. Today, firearms were used against polish army and militia officers. There are some losses. - What is it? - A leaflet. With tomorrow's date, Who signed it? Presidium of the Voivodship National Council in Gdask What are they doing? They gave orders for the army divisions to surround the shipyard and the port and Kocioek told people to go back to work... It's entrapment... No... Call Gdask. Tell them to stop the trains. Janczyszyn here. Listen! You have to stop trains to Gdynia! Polish State Railways do not agree to do that. Cut off the electricity! People cannot come to the area of shipyard and port. It is not your business comrade admiral. Take care of your own tasks. Yes sir! THURSDAY I am just thinking... how will we set up the Christmas Eve this year? We will invite Leon, Irena. It will be all right. But, we don't have enough chairs. - We have enough. - But we have to invite our lodger. We will borrow some from our neighbours. Bruno, what about toys? I don't know. I'll figure it out. - What about the Christmas tree? - Christmas tree! Christmas tree! You buy the Christmas tree just before the Christmas Eve. My sandwiches! Bruno, it will be our first Christmas Eve in this apartment. I know. Put them in my bag. I care so much that we will remember it. We will remember. Let me go.

We took him to the pulmonary hospital. But he needs a blood transfusion so he won't stay there. - Zapora to liwa. - This is liwa. Ataman reports that they are carrying that deceased from Gdynia Shipyard. The one hit by heli strike. Kasztan, I say again, Kasztan requests report on our countermeasures, roger, over. Report to Kasztan, negative on countermeasures, risk increasing, rioters are stopping, taking their hats off, crying. - Large group forming. - liwa, copy that. Gujana respond. This is Gujana to liwa.

WADYSAW GOMUKA First Secretary of the Central Committee of the United Polish Worker's Party In Gdask there were two thousand militia and the army had to shoot! As it turns out - they were shooting blanks. Well, it's inappropriate for army to shoot first - for that we have militia. What is next? Jamming of Radio Free Europe has been increased. STEFAN OLSZOWSKI The secretary of the Central Committee We can turn to the Soviets for help here. In charge of the Press, Radio and Television Independently of the economical situation we must focus on political matters. Starting tomorrow. We need to state, that enemy is alive, acting, creating wide scale diversion. JZEF CYRANKIEWICZ The member of the Politbiuro The prime minister Going from works to works, forwarding orders by phone, spreading rumors. So there are enemy groups! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers!

Affirmative, Military and Police storming. Friendlies, military are popping smoke and flashbangs, storming. What about arresting and detaining that street menace? MARIAN SPYCHALSKI There are rules that a prosecutor The Chairman of the Polish Council of State can approve for an arrest warrant up to three months. I can't listen to this anymore! As allegedly militia and MSW acted, heroically, not actually doing anything. Where else in the world can this be happening? You've created an environment of rotten liberalism and hooligan actions. I don't give a damn about this whole propaganda, if it helps - shoot to maintain order. I should dismiss all those militia commanders and ministers for not knowing the law! Tomorrow we start a political campaign on television. JZEF TEJCHMA The member of the Politbiuro. How much shall we talk about the riots? Rather refrain from informing at all. As for the economical matters, we need to organize a sale of fish, no margin, no unions, no storehouses. The Presidium of the City Council Faster! Move you ass! Fucking faster! Move! Stay still!

How many letters is that? Seventeen. On the table! One, two, three, four! Five! Six! Seven! Give me! Seventeen! Get the fuck out of here! Fuck, he passed out. Breniew called. Soviet comrades couldn't sleep all night. They are worried. Breniew asked if there is a risk that incidents will spread all over the country. He asked about the situation in the army. And if our means are enough to bring back the peace. I told him that the incidents were not caused by the proce-hike but the reasons were sort of political. And that our means are enough but of course we would ask our soviet comrades for help if needed. If the incidents start in other cities we need to use weapon. Otherwise soviet army will enter our country. And we will be worthless. The Party and the government will not have any authority. And our situation will be even worse than this in Czechoslovakia. Our youth is raised on dashing and heroic traditions. This is a bad upbringing. Kasprzycki! Come upstairs! Leave me fucking alone! - Come! - You... You... I will fuck you all, fuck! Which one! Which! Which the fuck one! Which! Let this hand! - Let him die! - It's all right now. - When he calms down, take him to the operating room. - Cut this off! Doctor. We won't give our blood for those like him. He doesn't need the blood transfusion. Do you feel all right? Is everything ok.? Do you have a family? Children? Yes. Go back to them. No, I can't. It's the curfew. I will lose my taxi permission. But I couldn't go earlier. Because of the children. Now the lodger is back and he will look after the kids. I thought that it was a mistake, he would come back home. I think that he is in hospital in Redowo. I beg you, please take me there. Go, don't you see what is going on with her?

Two armoured cars were destroyed and few were damaged. In Elblg groups of juveniles in the streets. They are being arrested. There are no adults. In Gdynia many people have been arrested. High excitement in the society. There are some proofs of hatred against the authority. - Your pass! - I don't have the pass, but this woman is going to the hospital! What is going on here? - I report that they don't have the pass. - Why are you driving without the pass? - The curfew is from 5 p.m. - She had a note that she has to go to the hospital right away.

Calm down, Stenia, sit down. - Which hospital is he in? - In Redowo. - In Redowo? One of my former pupils works there. He is a doctor. He will help for sure. - Where are kids? - Mariola is with my neighbours - and Romek and Gabrysia are at school. - So go back home. As far as I get to know something, I'll let you know. - No, Leon.

My brother-in-law Leon Drywa. You have to take him too! - There is no place in the car. No way! - Where does he live? - Szenwalda street. - It's on our way. We can take him! - It's half an hour for each funeral. - We don't have time! - We have time. Stay still! Stay still! Murderers! Please... Leave! Stenia? - And who are you? - Mr Leon Drywa? - Yes. - We came for you. - What is going on? Leon, we have to bury Bruno. Do you know what time is it? My brother is not a criminal to be buried in the middle of the night as some kind of villain! Listen... Besides there is no time for explanation. We have to go! No, you listen.

They don't want that you remind everyone about what happened. - Good morning. - Good morning. - How do you know? - I found out. The conditions are supposed to be good but nobody know how long they will keep you there. - I am not going anywhere! - Stenia, I know. You have to hide together with children. You cannot stay with the family because they will find you. I will give you the address and the money. When it calms down, I'll let you know. - Get dressed! - Romek, help me! Daddy!
