So Chad, yo, let me ask you, man, like, why you guys moving down here and shit? - Homosexuals? - No, man. I mean, just like from the suburbs. - Well, the rent down here is cheap. The neighborhood's cute, you know, and it's different to what I'm used to. So, you move in, you invest in the area, you help it out and you build something. Actually... All right, here you go, you know, you guys should stop by. You should come by sometime, you know, um, you straight people are allowed to have fun too, you know. - Is this your thing? - Yep, that's my Saturday night staple. - Yeah, we can go on Saturday, right, Agroni?

Open it up, change the lock, and I'll go check out Lena. - I don't like the dick, okay? - Why not, man? You should try it, bro, everyone's doing it. - What? (Agroni speaks in Albanian) - It's in style man, we'll find you a nice guy, bro. What's up, Len? - Are we gonna go to Opal later? - Yes, yes, Len, just play, okay. If I finish, we will. - Oh man. - You've got more white paint, right? I'll take fucking this, these fucking DVDs. - Well it's too bad, man, tough shit. (toilet flushes) - [Agroni] Hey! - Hello?

They're better than us, you know? They're cleaner, and they're smarter, they're more loyal. Just depends who raised them. Discipline. Teach them. - Dino, please, man, let's just finish this. Where's my girl, bro? - Thing is, I never have children because I know I am improperly bred to raise them correct. Like your tenant Rolexa, huh? The one you shit on all the time? She's terrible mother. - I never shit on her, okay? I took care of her son a couple of times. It was your girl or something? - She was not mine, she belonged to streets. She sucked dick for a living. (dogs bark) She steals from me, you know. She had somebody steal from me. I kill her. - Dino, I did what you asked for, man. - You good father, King? Huh? My father, he's not very nice. It's healthy to suffer sometimes, you know? To suffering is to cleansing. My children, they gotta suffer. They value when I feed them that much more. - Dino, I understand, man. I fucked up, okay? I'm sorry. What are we gonna do here? I'm gonna watch you eat or what? - Jag, clean up the ring. - It's what we agreed to, man. - Yeah, okay. (laughing) (he whistles) I bet you work hard for this, huh? - I did what I had to do. - I don't see that because this not 25 Gs, man. That's what we talk about on the phone, huh? - Let me see her face, let me see she's okay, okay? You got half there, you follow me, you get the rest. Okay? And we're done. - Yeah? Ah. Dog, what do you think, huh? You think I'm one of these dumb fucking tenants you fuck with all day? - No, man. Let's just finish this, that's all I wanna do. (Dino laughs) - Your little girl, she's something else, you know? She louder, scratched harder than a lot of little bitches I see before. You train her well, huh? - Lena!

Dino, the money's in the trunk, man, don't hurt my fucking daughter. - Check the trunk, bring me the loot, go, go! - I didn't do this for no fucking reason! (dogs bark) - No, no! Don't hurt him! - Oh you motherfuckers! You sick motherfuckers! - What do you think, G? Maybe we're gonna feed this motherfucker's girl to Lucifer, make him watch. What do you think, Lucy, huh? It's been a long time since you have some human meat, I'm sure, huh? - Len, turn around! I'm okay, baby. She don't need to see this, man, get her outta here, man, it's just between you and me, you motherfucker. - Listen to you. I bet you act like you're Christ and shit to people, huh? Remember all that slick shit you was talking to me on the phone, Shqiptar, huh? (he speaks in Albanian) To my dogs, I am their savior. I bet you wish you had one right about now.

I'm gonna have some fun with this. - [Elvis] Lena, turn around. - Yeah, turn around. - [Elvis] You motherfucker, Dino. - I'm here, baby, I'm here. - [Elvis] She doesn't need to see this! - What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? You want this? - [Elvis] No! - How about this? - [Elvis] Dino, please, man, fucking take it and get out of here! Okay, okay, okay. Dino, enough, okay, Dino. - Daddy! - Very good, very good. Just like the sheep back home, we slice them, eat them well done. You got a lot of good meat, baby. - [Elvis] Agh you sick fuck! You sick fuck! - Yeah. - [Elvis] I'm gonna fucking kill you, you motherfucker. - You're not gonna do nothing, man, you're gonna do nothing. - Lena. - Dad! - Don't make me kill you in front of her and then fuck your bloody corpse, okay? - [Pete] Get on the ground, motherfucker! - Get off, you sick motherfucker! - You gonna like this shit? You like this huh? - No! Don't hurt him! - Watch your daddy, watch your daddy. Argh! You sick motherfucker! (shouting) (Dino gags) - Get me out of here, daddy. Daddy... Daddy. Daddy. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, okay. (phone rings) Hey, baby, come on, come on. - [Phone] Leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you. - Hey, it's me. I kind of forgot what you sounded like. I quit smoking. So, Lena says she wants to make video games when she grows up. I know, that's crazy, right? She's getting so big, and she's just like you, smart. And she just loves, and loves, and loves. And I don't deserve it the way I never deserved you. I'm so sorry, I don't know what's coming after this but I'm ready for it, you know? I'm trying. I'm trying so hard. I miss you more and more every day. (electronic music)
