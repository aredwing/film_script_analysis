Even though the Middle East is fractured by... Burning U.S. flags continues as unrest in Afghanistan... And the other part is under full Israeli control. Beeline, this is Apache Renegade, nearing extraction point 3.0. How copy? Apache Renegade, this is Beeline. All copy. Beeline, Team Dogbite is on the ground. Repeat, Team Dogbite is on the ground, outside Matubahk. Returning to outpost Renegade. Copy that, Apache. Good luck. Now? Nope. Not now. Roger that. I'll be damned. You see that? Now? Nope. Not now. Now. All clear. Moving. This was Johnny Longbow's. A rabbit's foot? Can't hurt. No, thanks. I'm trying to quit. We're at Zulu, up high. You got a visual? Roger. Moving to Bravo. Vasquez. Overwatch, confirm clear. We're ready to check Bravo. We're good here. Bravo is clear bottom. Heading topside. Overwatch, Two is at Charlie. Anything in my area? That's a negative. Quiet as a mouse. Hey, Vic. Yeah, Jake. I've been thinking about that 50 bucks I owe you. Hey, don't even. And it's 60 bucks. How about if we knock off five dollars for every time I save your ass today? Tell you what. How 'bout we double-down if I get your butt out of here in one piece? No deal. Where does an entire personal security detail disappear to? That's the same thing I was thinking, man. I really don't know. Your guess is as good as mine. Just keep your eyes open, head on a swivel. Copy all. Two holding at Charlie. Bravo is clear above and below. We got a butt-load of mix-caliber brass, some blood trails, nothing else. - All right? - Yeah. They're done. No package. Beeline, Beeline, this is Dogbite. How copy? Over. Dogbite, Beeline. Solid copy. Send it. Beeline, Beeline, Dogbite is at Delta. I say again, Dogbite is at Delta. We have the personal security detail all down hard. No joy on the package. I say again, no joy on the package. Last chance is Echo. Oscar Mike there now. How copy? Dogbite, copy all. Standing by. Hey. Vasquez. Doc, eyes. Hey, you think they're waiting for us inside? No. They're gonna hit us on the way out. Doc. Clear! Clear! Clear. - Positive ID? - Yep, that's the congressman. Help me cut him down. Cut him. Got it. Bring him down. I got him. Yep, he's mine. Congressman? Congressman! Sir! All right, they got him narc'd with something. I'm gonna hit him with some Narcan to bring him out of it, then we gotta get out of here ASAP. Beeline, Beeline, be advised, we have the package. I say again, we have the package. Sir, sir, sir, stay calm. Look at me, look at me. - No! - Hey, look at me, okay? We're here to help you, okay? Beat up, but still breathing. We will be moving to Foxtrot 3 for exfil. Seven pax. And we need a doc on the bird. How copy? Over. Dogbite, Beeline. Copy all. No birds available at this time. Exfil will be ground. Meet the vics at Foxtrot 3. They are rolling now. Beeline, that is a piss-poor option. I say again, piss-poor option. We have a priority package. Can we get a bird? Negative, Dogbite. No air authorized on this one. ETA on the vics is five mikes, call sign "Rattler. " Copy, Beeline. We'll talk about this later. Break, break. Overwatch, Overwatch. Be advised we are Oscar Mike to Foxtrot 3 for ground exfil. I say again, ground exfil. Cover our move and join the party once you have eyes on the incoming vic. How copy? Over. Oh, hang on. There's dust being kicked up by something on the back street to your right as you come out. Roger that. We'll come out with the package when ride is confirmed. Confirmed. Humvee inbound. All right, gents. You heard him? Good? Marcus, give Doc a hand. Okay. All right, help us out. Get on your legs. Use those legs. There you go, buddy. All right, you are glue to him. All right. Overwatch, Overwatch, we are Oscar Mike with package to Foxtrot 3 for exfil. Cover our six. Roger. On our way. Moving. Let's go. Go. This is your fire station. Maintain my six. Copy. Oh, man, that felt like a trap from the get-go. Like we had a choice. At least they're not behind us. Not yet, anyway. This is as far as we can go. Rattler, Rattler! We're in a firefight at position Charlie. Not sure we can make it to Foxtrot 3. If you make it, you come to us. Doc, Miller, Marcus, move it! Let's go! Doc's down! Doc's down! Cover! Shit! Rattler! Rattler! This is Dogbite! We're still in a heavy firefight! Position Charlie! Playtime is over! Playtime is definitely over! When you enter the ville, bypass Foxtrot 3. Head directly to the city square. I say again, city square. We're on the southwest corner. And, gents, give us as much firepower as you got so we can get this package on the vic. Over there! Break, break! Overwatch, Overwatch! Join us ASAP as soon as you have eyes on the vics inbound. Moving now. Overwatch, watch my right! Come on, pick it up! Come on! Put your hand on my shoulder and don't let go. Get him in there! Get him in there! - Secure the package! - In here! Come on, buddy! Get him in! Vic, we can't hold this position any longer. Don't you move! Don't you dare move! Vic, we gotta go. Jake, where are you guys? We gotta move! Come on, boy, let's go. Vic, the orders are clear! You're risking everything now! Shit! Get out of here! Go! Come on. - Do you know your name? - Cooper. Cooper? Congressman Cooper, I'm Sergeant Richter of the U.S. Army. We're taking you back to base, all right? Let me have that thing. Keep it up. Come here. You're gonna be okay. All right. Where are you? Open another field dressing. Give me one more pack. Hurry up. How you doing, buddy? We should go back. We can't. Getting the congressman to safety is our number one priority. I know what our number one priority is. Okay. I'm just saying I'd like to go back. And we will, Vic, as soon as we can. Hang in there, buddy. Hang in there. I gotta keep pressure, okay? You all right? Step on it, Charlie! I'm crushing it, Vic. I'd like to be more helpful, Miss Conrad, but your timing's off. Maybe in a couple of days. I can't believe this. You're deliberately hamstringing me, Colonel. Why? Nobody is hamstringing anybody. It's simply not safe outside the wire right now. That's ridiculous. This is a war zone. It's never going to be safe. Look, you may have finagled your way onto this combat outpost, and you may be Admiral Willet's niece, but none of that buys you a ride outside this wire. It's just too damn dangerous. I'll have you know I was embedded with Cheyenne at Obamadad. Yeah, and three soldiers were killed on that ride-along. Ah, so you're saying I'm some kind of jinx, is that it? You're saying I got those men killed? I'm not saying anything of the kind. Here's what I am saying. You are not going outside my wire. End of discussion. I see. So you are hamstringing me. Let's go, men! Oh, shit. What's that? Move it! Move it! Let's go! Medics on the way! Let's go! Get him out, get him out! Okay. Hey, get the congressman down to the colonel now, ASAP. Trevor, close that gate, damn it! Secure it! Medic's here, buddy. No, Charlie, I can walk. Don't need no medic. We can get you inside, get you all patched up. No, I can walk. Let me walk. Vic! I'm sorry, buddy. It has to be this way. Get him on the stretcher now! - You! Get over here! - Hey! Come on. One, two, three. - Charlie, you got him? - I got him. Grab him. One, two, three, go! Let's go, move. I don't know who you are or what you want, but stay away from my men. And who authorized you to take photos? Easy, cowboy. Stay away from my men. Do you understand me? NATO correspondent, so just cool down, okay? Hey, you can't do that. Give that back to me. Give that- - Charlie, keep her out. - Yes, sir. - Oh, my God. - No, no, no. Excuse me, Sergeant, is that Congressman Cooper? Ma'am, please, just stand back. Is that Congressman Stan Cooper? Ma'am, please step aside. What is he doing in there? Is he wounded? Damn it! - It was just a bright flash of light right in my eyes. It must have ricocheted off the Humvee. My face feels like it's on fire! I know, Marcus. Let Shipley take a look. Well? I can see shapes. It's all blurry. Marcus, listen to me, buddy. Stop talking and let Shipley take care of your wounds. Just sit back and relax, okay? We'll be back to check on you. - Let's go. - Hey, Vic. Yeah. Thanks for dragging me into that Humvee. If I had just been a little bit faster. Yeah, forget it. It's what we do, right? We watch each other's six. May I have a word with you? V? You know what we gotta do. Go get the gear prepped. Stand by. Roger that. What do you want? I know we got off on the wrong foot. I'd really like to fix that. You know I got a job to do. So do you. Sometimes I can be a little pushy 'cause I'm one of those people no one ever wants around. If I don't push, I don't get. Makes me pretty unpopular. So I'm sorry. Fair enough. Janet Conrad. That Janet Conrad? What's that supposed to mean? I think maybe I heard of you. Don't start with this jinx nonsense. Imbedded in Portacurdey. - Obamadad. - Have a nice day. Was that Congressman Cooper you just brought in? I don't know who you're talking about. Of course you do. Congressman Stanford Cooper. He's one of the most vocal opponents of military spending. He'd shut this whole operation down if he could. Cut your paycheck, cancel your vacation, shoot your dog, yet here he is. Why? Sure sounds like you know a lot more than I do. What's he doing here? Why are you being so evasive? I have a debrief to attend. We didn't make it out, huh? No. What about the others? Some did, some are lying out there. Thanks for not leaving me behind. Don't mention it, brother. Jake? Yeah. I can't move my legs. I'm trying, but... I can't feel anything. You got a round lodged in your spine. I stopped the bleeding, but... there's really not much more I could do for now. We gonna have to wait until some folks get here. When will that be? Soon, I hope, man. Our 119 is shot. Can't fix this damn thing. Probably we're gonna have to just wait it out. And you checked the bodies? Yes, sir. All of 'em. Full of bullet holes. Some of 'em cut up. Bodies were all stripped clean of body armor and weapons. They had the bodies stacked up in that little shop across the street from the hotel. Looks to me like it was a real intense, close-quarter battle. They lost. Then we headed over to the hotel. They had the congressman strung up there like a damn worm on a hook, and we took the bait. Then what? Request to speak freely. Shoot. How in the hell does a non-military observer like the congressman get authorization to go on some sightseeing tour in Matubahk and then fall into a damn ambush that is so perfectly laid out that not one of the team members of the personal security detail survives or radios for help? Don't smell right, sir. I don't have a good answer for you, Sergeant Mosby. What about the congressman? Why was he spared? Who the hell knows? Maybe they were planning to stage some Internet extravaganza with him or trade him for something they want. Hell, they only had him for a day. Maybe they didn't have any plan at all. Maybe. All right, sir, look, as far Chandler and Cannon go- If you're talking about going back into Matubahk today, negative. Why? Those are my men, sir. Because I'm short of people and ammunition. Here's the deal, Mosby. Renegade got hit hard last night, and they're still under pressure. All available air assets have been committed to that fight. In the meantime, I get word a major Taliban force is headed in our direction. If that's the case, I don't have the people, and I don't have the ammo to stage an effective defense. So I am not authorizing anything outside the wire until we get resupplied and reinforced. Now go see about your men. All right, when do we go? - We don't. - What? Colonel says we wait. That doesn't make any sense. I know. He's got his reasons. I'm just not sure I'm buying. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna go ask some questions. You stand by. Be ready to move. Marcus. You awake, buddy? Hey, Vic. Yeah, I'm awake, all right. They just gave me a shot of the good stuff, so it won't be long. That's good, buddy. That's good. You need your rest. Well, I'm sorry about Doc and the guys. Yeah, yeah, we all are. I guess compared to them, I'm the lucky one. I want you to have this. Maybe it'll do you some good. Besides, I heard there's a jinx in the camp. News travels fast, huh? You, uh, sure you can spare this? Yeah, I'm sure. As long as you have it on you, you'll be okay. All right, buddy. I'll take real good care of it, all right? Congressman? It's okay, it's okay. You're safe, you're safe. I'm Sergeant First Class Mosby. I was leading the rescue team this morning, sir. It's okay, it's okay. Relax, relax. Congressman. - Sir. - Hmm? I need to know what happened in Matubahk. Sir, was it an ambush or was it something else, sir? Congressman? You're not gonna get anything out of him, Vic. He's been on the hard stuff for a while. Ah, damn it. Yeah. I heard him talking before he passed out. He was rambling. What'd you hear him say? He said a name two, three times. I don't... Ab- Abdul Abbat... Abdul Azim Abad? Sergeant. How's your friend? Ma'am? You keep doggin' me. Why? Hey, I thought we were friends now. Besides, you're the most interesting soldier I've met so far. Well, you must not be looking too hard. Let's call a truce. I'm sure we can find a happy balance, don't you think? You haven't even gotten to know me yet. Oh, I think I know you pretty well. Let's see. Spoiled little rich girl. Probably went to Harvard, Yale, Princeton. Mount Saint Agnes. Oh, Mount Saint Agnes. Close. Uh, you got some heavy hitters in your background. The kind of folks that can push along your little career in NATO to get you exactly where you want to be fast. I'm guessing you're probably somebody's daughter, granddaughter... Niece. Niece! Admiral Willett's. Oh, even better. That's outstanding. Admiral. Well, the admiral must not be too fond of you if he sent you here. You kidding me? I begged for this assignment. But your colonel keeps smothering me. Now it wouldn't do for the lieutenant colonel to allow you to get your ass shot up on his watch. Can you blame him? Well, no, but I didn't fly all the way out here just to photograph some soldiers washing their skivvies and playing horseshoes. Hmm. I have to ride along on a mission. I see. I feel your pain. But that is not my call. Now, ma'am, if you will excuse me, I've got some skivvies to wash. It's funny. My girl back home is always ragging on me. Stress of all this makes her kind of crazy, you know? So yesterday I get this letter from her. Not a phone call, just an old-fashioned letter. Says she found someone new. Someone who could be there for her. Someone who wasn't halfway around the world. Didn't think this day could get any worse, and then this happens. I mean, what are the chances, right? Listen, man, you're gonna get a Silver Star out of this when it's all over, and you'll have all the girlfriends you want. Yeah, right. Sergeant, Jackson wants to see you. - He send you to look for me? - That's the memo. Damn. Stand by. Never waste a good cigar. Colonel. Gents, we got an update on what happened to our resupply. This is Bashir. He's a terp from Renegade. Seems Bashir and a specialist by the name of Tyler were on one of the supply trucks. Escort hits an IED ambush followed by a ground attack. Bashir and Tyler take off cross-country in the truck. They reach a point about eight clicks from here. Truck breaks down. Bashir dismounted, walked the rest of the way in to bring us the information. What's the current status? Well, Specialist Tyler seems to think that it's a relatively minor mechanical problem, something like a broken fuel line. He's standing security there, but he can't call for help. No radio in the truck. Well, QRF from Renegade should be handling that. Yeah, and maybe they haul his truck back to Renegade. We need that fuel and ammo more than they do right now. So I want you to get out there, find that truck, help Tyler get it fixed and roll it back here. Take Vasquez, take Jennings. Bashir will show you the way. Any questions? - I got one, sir. - Yeah? What about Abdul Azim Abad? What about him? He's on our top ten hit list of bad guys, and he's operating in that AO. How do you know that? Folks talk in their sleep, sir. Look, you might as well know. When Congressman Cooper came up here, he had an agenda. The whole idea was to prove that all our efforts are just a big waste of time and money. He insisted on visiting an isolated or abandoned village, and we only had one of those in our AO. - Matubahk. - Yeah. Now you get out there and find that truck. Yes, sir. Vic. JR? If you can't get that truck rolling, pull what cargo you can and blow the rest in place. We got very little time and a lot to do. Roger that, sir. Let's go, guys. Jake? I'm burning up, man. I know. Listen, I gotta go. You're not leaving me, are you? No. I'm going to get Doc's med pack and some water. Use this. Just don't shoot the wrong guys. Roger that. All right. I'll just wait right here. I haven't been out this way in almost a year. Looks like a great place for an ambush. Hardly anybody uses it anymore. It turns into a dirt road just up ahead. Let's just try not to hit any IEDs while we're out here, huh? Yeah, you got it. - I don't like it. - How's that? Convoy gets hit by a IED ambush, and the one vehicle that has all the munitions and supplies that we need goes all Evel Knievel and escapes, but breaks down before it can get to us. You think maybe this is a setup? I don't know, V. Maybe. Hey, look. I don't see our boy Tyler yet, so don't get too close. Go ahead, stop. Bashir. You know Specialist Tyler, right? Yes, Sergeant. Go ahead and walk on out there and call his name. Excuse me? About halfway between here and there. We'll cover you. As you wish. Go on. Be ready, boys. He seems awfully jumpy. I might be too. Yeah. Point taken. Mr. Tyler? Huh? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This is perfect. Get back in the truck. This is what I came here for. Don't you try to stop me now. I'll wring your scrawny little neck. Sounds like fun, but I don't think my uncle would like it. Stay behind me. Mr. Tyler, are you still here? Freeze right where you are! Hands behind your head! It's me, Bashir. I brought help. Hey, Bashir, buddy. I didn't know who it was at first. Sorry, man. I was kind of a sitting duck out here right now, you know? I understand completely. All right, let's get on with this. Brother, am I glad to see you boys. Need a hand, Specialist Tyler? Need a fuel line. What makes you think it's a fuel line? Well, I'm out of gas, and I shouldn't be. Might be a hole in the tank, but I didn't see one. She turns over okay? Yeah. No, everything's in perfect working order, except... - You're out of gas. - Right. I got more gas than I need in the back of the truck, but... not gonna do anyone any good there. All right. Let's go take a look, Jennings. Do you mind? Could you guys shake hands again? One more time. Oh, that's so good. All right, Jennings, get us out of here ASAP. I'll figure it out. Oh, dear God. Just about to tell you about her. Yeah, that too. Specialist Tyler... could I have a word with you in private? Absolutely. All right, Specialist, lay it on me. Well, I lost my escort around 0400 hours. I was lucky to have gotten around the lead vehicle, so I went off-road. Figure that's where I picked up the damage. Radio took a hit. About an hour after sunup, she comes running out in the middle of the road. I almost ran her over. She, uh, hit the ground pretty hard, so I stopped. She was a wreck, Sergeant. She was crying, begging for help. Bashir said she wasn't making any sense, and that's when we discovered she had that baby hidden there. Anybody chasing her? No, I mean, not that we could see. I don't even know where she came from. There's not a lot back in these hills. That's all? That's it. I mean, you know, without a radio in the truck, I didn't know what to do. And with the baby and all, I just put her out of sight in the back. We continued on to Wildside, then this happened. Hmm. That's one hell of a story, Specialist. It's all true. It's just a camera. We won't hurt you. That's it. Tell her. Well? It's very hard to interpret. She speaks one of the minor languages. Sansi, I think. Very hard to make out. Great. Well, she knows we'll help her, or she wouldn't have flagged Specialist Tyler down. Conrad, go back to the other vehicle and go get her some food and water. What? You found your way on this mission. Now you're part of it. Now move your ass. Let's go. - Sergeant Jennings? - Yeah. Your nickname is Detroit because you're good with cars, right? That's the rumor. Get your butt under this Deuce-and-a-half, find the problem so we can get the hell out of here. - I'm on it. - I'll help you. Bashir? Why didn't you tell us about her? Sergeant, there are many like her. I didn't think it was of any real importance. All I could think of was helping Mr. Tyler. Now, is there anything else that you have failed to mention to me? No, sir. I am very sorry. Wow. There's enough gas and ammo in here to blow us all to hell. Or start a small war. - Is something wrong? - I can't find the MREs. Thanks. That was some crazy stunt you pulled, Miss Conrad. Why would you do a thing like that? Pearls don't lie on the seashore, Detroit. If you want one, you gotta dive for it. This one? Yeah, that's it. Hey. I feel kind of naked out here. You mind sharing? I shouldn't, but under the circumstances, here. Thanks. How's it going? Nothing yet. You give 'em to her. You're less threatening. Less threatening? Yeah, you're a lot less threatening. Now put that away and don't shoot yourself and jinx us. You're getting your very own article out of this, Sergeant. I can't wait. I happen to be an expert marksman. Can you say the same? Jake. How'd it go? Good for now. What's the short of it, Jennings? We got a problem. Not that short. Can you fix it? I think so. I gotta swap out a section of this line and see if it'll hold. And that's it? You'll be done? Maybe. I won't know until I do it and then I test it. ETA. I gotta cut out the old line first and then I'll know more. Better have some good news for us soon. I'd hate to have to blow this truck up. I'm doing my best. We know, son. Just get it done, Jennings. We gotta get outta here. Okay, Bashir. Let's try this one more time. Yes, Sergeant. How's it going back here? We're doing fine. I think she trusts me. Good, because I need you to check her out medically and otherwise. Make sure she's okay before we take her into Wildside. I'll give it a shot. I don't have any experience at this. You. Make her understand. I don't care if you have to act it out or what. Yes, sir. Don't call me "sir. " I work for a goddamn living. Get in the truck. Got it. Well? I gotta cut a piece of line, replace this. Don't look like much. You'd be surprised how much trouble a little part can cause. Well, don't let me stop you, Jennings. Get it done. - I'll help you cut it. - I got a saw on the truck. Sergeant? Yeah. The lady wants you. Okay. Yeah, what's up? Thought you ought to see this. This is bad. Hmm. She been whipped. No wonder she wanted to get away. Probably punishment for something. Any sign of infection? Not that I could see. All right. Well, just do what you can, then, uh, check the baby out, make sure he's okay. And you, wait here with her, all right? - Of course. - In the truck. How's our guest? Pretty rough. Someone whipped the hell out of her, but nothing a little time won't heal, I guess. I guess maybe Tyler did the right thing after all. Maybe. Maybe not. One thing he was right about: We are sitting ducks out here. Contact! Heads up! Go. Get down. How many you think there are? Not enough to rush us. Not yet anyway. Jennings, Tyler, sitrep! - A-okay! - Good to go! Conrad! All good. Reload! Up! Get back here. - Vasquez! - Let me go! Stay put. What are you trying to do, get yourself killed? You do realize we're sitting on a powder keg here. One wild shot hits those explosives back there, boom! V, I've gotta make it to that Deuce-and-a-half. I'm gonna bring it back here as a shield for this truck. That's suicide, Vic. Jennings! I gotta make it to your truck and bring it back here. Sergeant, let me go. Are you sure you can bring the truck back alongside this truck? I can try. We'll give as much cover fire as we can. - Roger that. - Tyler! You got any smoke grenades in the back? - Negative, Sarge! - All right, Jennings. Run like the wind, boy. Ready? - Yeah. - Three, two, one, go! Run, run, run! Jennings! - I'm moving up. - Go, go! Get in the truck. Tyler! Reloading! I need a mag! Heads up! Good work, Jennings. All right, Conrad. Let's get baby-mama transferred over. Roger that. What about me, Mosby? You can still drive, right? Hell yeah, I can. All right. For now, get your weapon and put some cover fire on that hillside. Roger that. Keep your head down. Hey, V, I need you to set a demo charge on Tyler's truck. Use the remote detonators, and we'll blow it when we're on the road out of here. Come on! We're getting out of here. You stay here. I'll get up there, and I'll pull you up. You got that? You wait here. I go first, okay? You're welcome. Get ready. Conrad! Check on Conrad. Vasquez, med kit now! You okay? It's just my side. I think it's just grazed. Heads up. Why did it have to be like this? You'd be long gone by now if it wasn't for me. No. I'm right where I'm supposed to be. Your family... must worry about you a lot, huh? Ha. I wouldn't know. Oh. Sometimes it's good not to know, I guess. Works for me. Why are you doing this for me? I don't know, man. You kinda remind me of my little brother. He always tried to do his best. I'm just doing mine. He's gone now? Yeah, Desert Storm. I'm sorry my best wasn't good enough. If a man does his best, what else is there? We're all set. This thing blows, there won't be nothing left but the tires. Good. What happened here? Miss Conrad there decided she wanted to earn herself a Purple Heart. Didn't do this on purpose. Let's keep that blood pressure down until I stop this bleeding. - Hey, Sergeant? - Yeah. Help a girl out? My camera. Sure. Don't forget to spell my name right in the photo credits. What exactly is your name? Victor. Victor? Victor Thomas Mosby. I'll remember that. Okay. It sure got quiet all of a sudden. Yup. Like somebody flipped a switch. Wonder why. You think it was seeing Miss Conrad? Nope. They shot her easy enough. You think it's her? I do, V. When they saw her, it was all over. But why? I don't know. But I'm sure she does. Grab him, Bashir. Poor Mr. Tyler. He was so very brave. All right, Mr. Bashir. Here's what's gonna happen next. What do you mean, Sergeant? I want to know who that girl is. And I want to know now. Sergeant, I already- Shh shh shh shh! Here's the deal. There are dozens of languages just floating around out here. Maybe she knows one of them. And we'll never know... unless we try. Maybe you'll get lucky. Got me? Yes, Sergeant. Get to it. Go. What you thinking about, Jake? I'm thinking about trying to get out of here. Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing. Any ideas? Yeah. I'm gonna go downstairs and commandeer us a truck. Yeah? When you gonna do that? Right now. Conrad! Anything? Maybe. Been at it for a while. Jennings, how's it going under there? Almost there, Sergeant. Bashir? Well? She speaks some Dani. What'd you find out? You'll be very surprised, Sergeant. Her name is Jada. She's the daughter-in-law of the Taliban leader Abdul Azim Abad, a very powerful, very evil man. Yeah, we know who he is. And that is his only grandson. Well, how about that. You think she's telling the truth? You saw how those rebels reacted when they got a look at her. They fell back like their asses were on fire. Well, I think she's telling the truth. And if she is telling the truth, she's worth her weight in gold. What are you saying? Sergeant Jennings, soon as you get finished under there, I want you in the front of the vehicle. Conrad, I want you in the rear of the vehicle. I want you guys to keep your eyes open and your heads down. Now that they know we have her, this isn't the end of it. Roger that. V, let's go for a walk. What's on your mind, Vic? What's on my mind is Cannon and Chandler. They're waiting on us back in Matubahk. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. Just hear me out. Vic, you can't be thinking what I'm thinking. Look, Old Abdul's daughter-in-law there, she's our ticket to waltz right back in to Matubahk, extract our boys without even firing a shot. Are you serious? You would use that lady and her baby as a human shield? Of course not. I'd just have 'em along, keep things peaceful, civilized. That's insane. Is it? I got a truck sitting right there with enough firepower to blow old Abdul and his boys to kingdom come. Now I got two things that he really wants. This will cost you big. You kidding me? I'm already out 60 bucks. - Beeline. - This is COP Wildside. Identify yourself. Beeline, this is Overwatch waiting for extraction. Copy, Overwatch. Message received. Colonel, this just came in. Well, thank Christ. I swear, Chandler's got more lives than a cat. Make sure I see all the traffic on this. Yes, sir. All right, everybody, listen up. This is what's gonna happen. Sergeant Jennings, very carefully, is going to take everybody back to Wildside. I'm going to take command of Tyler's vehicle. Roger that. As soon as you arrive at Wildside, I want you to inform Colonel Jackson that I elected to take a slight detour and reunite this young lady and her baby with her family, and that I will be following shortly thereafter. All right, anybody have any questions? Yeah. Hell yeah. Sorry, Conrad, we're out of time. Godspeed. Detroit. You're in charge now. Sergeant? I can't leave you sitting in the brig all by your lonesome. Who'd you have to boss around? Thanks. All right, let's gear up and move out. Get timers and blasting caps. Here. - Five minutes. - Meet you in the square. Rich. Rich, wake up, man. Cavalry's just arrived. Be ready. Don't run out on me, little brother. We're almost home, ya hear? Well, that answers one of my questions. And that answers the other. Halfway back up the street, right side. Rooftop, Sergeant Chandler. I can hardly wait to see what happens next. Let's get to it. Oh, look, proud grandpa. At least I hope he is. You should. Your life depends on it. Good luck, buddy. Hey, who needs luck when you've got a... rabbit's foot? Here we go. How. Very amusing, Sergeant. Just like I figured. Educated in the States. Four years Liberal Arts. Scholarship. You? Four years, high school. All right, have your men put their weapons on the ground, put their hands behind their head, and then we'll get this whole matter all wrapped up, nobody gets hurt. You truly are a very funny man. Well... your daughter-in-law sure seems to think so. And what a handsome grandson you have. Yup, he has your eyes, all right. He is very dear to me. My only son Emir was killed not too long ago. Very tragic. Do you think your son Amir would approve of you whipping Jada? She made some bad decisions. Interesting. An animal's foot... for good fortune? Well, you'd have to ask the rabbit about that. Get Jada and my grandson to me now... and I'll let you go. Is that your best offer? Okay, then. Stand by. Well? - Let her go. - What? Let her go. What choice do we have? Rot in hell, motherfucker! Get back! Reload! Vasquez, blow it! Come on. Detonator fail! You know... we're gonna be in a lot of trouble for all this. Probably. Most definitely. I, uh... I just want to say, uh... thank you. And? You're not a jinx. Wouldn't have missed it for the world. Besides, my uncle is an admiral. That's right, he is. So maybe you could put a good word in for me. I'm definitely gonna need it. I could be persuaded. Your exclusive story rights. All right, you win. What do you need from me? Well, we could start with a big hero smile. Okay. All right. Okay. Right here. Ohh. Man, what kept you, Vic? You still sore about that 50 bucks? Nope, and it's 60. Oh, you gonna be like that now? And after all the times I saved your life. All the times you saved my life? That's what people say. Yeah, right, and you don't call no more. You know why? We done broke the comms in all this excitement. Yeah, well, it was a very long day, brother. You know what? When you get a minute someday, you're gonna have to tell me about it. After you pay me my 60 bucks. Where's Cannon? He up there, yeah. Good to see ya. Sergeant Chandler? Yes, ma'am. Are you really as good as they all say you are? Every once in a while. -
