Uh, I'll-- I'll get some on the way back. Later. I'm in the middle of something. Bye. Bye. Wait. I just-- I just wanna talk to you. I made this for you. Don't you want it? # Angel, you make me glad # # Sometimes, you make me sad # # Don't be bad # # Make me happy # # Make me mad # Julie. I'm sorry. I'll be good. I promise. - No. Forget it. Let's call it a day. - No. No, I'll be good. I'll be so good. - How good? I'll, uh, hold my breath. How long? David! Oh, my God. I've run into this woman. She-- I didn't run into her. She was waiting outside my studio. I don't know-- How do they know where-- where I work? I-- I got really scared this time. - Let's call the police. Oh, I've called them so many times, they think I'm the crazy one. - Hi. - Hi. I'm interrupting your work. - I was about to wrap up anyway. Oh. Uh-- No. No. Don't, uh-- Don't stop because of me. I'll, uh-- I'll just hang out in the bedroom until, uh-- Uh-- Shit! Oh, shit! Shit! David! It's your grandmother's vase. I'm so sorry. Don't walk in here barefeet, okay? Got most of it. Go ahead and get dressed. I was just getting some water. Would anybody like some water? No? Okay. Um-- Hmm. So that's your wife? - Yes. What an interesting woman. - Oh, yeah, she is. - And very pretty. - Yes. She is. You don't wanna paint anymore, do you? No. Tomorrow? Again? Paint me? Yes? Yes. So I'll see you tomorrow, freshly bathed and scented, waiting for your singular observation. Sir. Julie? - Yes, David? Did I give you a check? Yesterday-- I-I-- I gave it to you yesterday, didn't I? All right. Sorry. So that's Julie? Yep. She seems nice. - Mm-hmm. And very pretty. Mmm. Well, yeah. - You're happy with how it's going? - Oh, yeah. Good. That's good. I bought something for you. Actually, it's for us. It's a game. It's a little silly, but I just couldn't resist. I read about this couple who-- No, actually, there was two couple-- No, three, and they had a competition-- - Cut to the chase. I hate it when you say that. It makes me feel superfluous. You are anything but superfluous. Prove it. Mm-hmm. - Ooh. So what's the game? Oh. Up on the shelf, behind you. This... green thing here? His name is Pogi. For the next month, we'll have to feed him, educate him... and take care of him when he's sick. He's sort of a... rehearsal child. You can't be serious. He's from Japan. Oh. I see. And, uh, what do I get if I keep this thing alive? I buy you dinner. - Fair. How many men would agree to, uh, raise a Pogi? Um, none. Only you, Mr. Blue. Ooh. - Ooh. Oh. You always win. Open up. Good-bye! - Good-bye! Hello. David, hey, um-- You look good. I got a friend I wanna hook you up with. His name is Carl Marx. Really. He owns Spew Gallery. David, that's a great gallery. You should show him your work. I can set it up. Mmm. - I'll think about it. Oh, you'll meet him. He'll meet him. I said I'd think about it. I gotta get going. It was good to see you, Stephen. You forgot something! - Later. Mary. Bye, Blue. Bye, Red. Take care, Stephen. I have this bizarre, recurring fantasy. I imagine David breaking into a morgue and having sex. Mm-hmm. With you? With dead people-- Dead women. And I see him pulling out all of those tables-- you know, the ones that sink into the wall like-like drawers... where they keep the cadavers. And there's this woman. She's always blonde and very thin, very young, and very dead. Mmm. How young? Very young. Anyway, he's being really careful, you know, not to rip out the sutures while he's, you know, humping her. And-- How am I to compete with a dead 15-year-old? How often do you have these fantasies? Um, mostly when we're having sex, so not very often. It kind of gets in the way of my concentration, Stephen. I can see how that could happen. Got anything to eat? All we have is cookies. Macadamia-chocolate chip and cranberry oatmeal, I believe. Do you think I'm warped-- about the dead girls? No! You would not believe what I think about when I have sex. Did David see that shrink I recommended? Stephen, I'm not supposed to look at that. - Then don't look at it. Well, this is definitely not a corpse. She is attractive, isn't she? - Uh-huh. What? - Nothing. What was that "uh-huh"? What? - Uh-- Uh-- You're being paranoid. - I'm being paranoid? Paranoid where? No. David's not having an affair. What made you say that? - I know how you think. No, you don't. - Yeah, I do. No, you don't. Yeah, I do. David is totally and absurdly devoted to you. You're right. It's just, uh-- I found a pair of underwear under my bed, and they're not mine. Ouch. Well-- Don't make any assumptions. There are women dressing and undressing here all the time. It's not outside the realm of possibility that-- Why do you have a tissue stuck up your nose? I keep getting these bloody nosebleeds. I need to get cauterized or something. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We can use these for the invitations. Stephen? - Uh-huh? Give me back my tissue. No. Wait. Am I gonna be able to come to your studio tomorrow? Not yet. - Yeah? Are you gonna cancel the show? Tell me n-- Ow! - No. Not going to cancel it. I'm warning you. If I don't get a first painting by Friday, I'm gonna dig a maxi pad out of a Dumpster, and I'll frame it and I'll sign it Mary Shaw. Are you listening to me? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. You're not having another prolonged existential crisis, are you? - I don't think so. - Good. 'Cause I don't think I could handle that. You're drinking. Just a glass. I thought you had an interview. - I do. Four ounces of alcohol is just enough... to make me forget how much I hate interviews. Hello. Uh, I'm Mary. I wasn't expecting you until 3:00, but here I am and there you are, so please. Yes. - Come in. Would you like something to drink? Say you're born a tiger. You're beautiful, elegant, regal, majestic, poetic. Universal symbol of strength and wisdom. What happens? People shoot you... to capture your essence, to participate in your drama. That wonder, that... "tigerness." - Uh! - I look at your work, and I see death, I see horror. I see the fight against injustice, against inertia. The-The glorious scream of hell. I see agony, ecstasy, the battle of opposing energies, of destruction and creation. I-- I see the primal force of female rage-- You do? - Yes. I-- I'm overwhelmed with emotions I can't even express. Uh, what-- What else do you see? As I was walking up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish to God he'd go away. Well, e-excuse me. Hi. You must be Mary. I'm Paula Krinsky from Perspective. Uh, you-- You're from Perspective? But-- Who are you? I'm Fran-- Fran Pinkerton. - Yes? I'm the president of the Bloody Marys. I wrote to you about appearing at our annual conference. Well, actually, it's our first and only conference, but we're planning on doing it again next year, so we thought it would be okay to call it our annual conference... as opposed to just our "conference." - Didn't you get my letter? - Fran, I think we need to stop our little chat now. - I can come back tomorrow. - It was wonderful meeting you, Fran. Thank you so much for sharing your heart and soul with me. I-I feel as if... the Virgin Mary herself had appeared to me in a dream... and-and poured her blood all over my body. Hot, thick, red-- Well, uh-- Yes. I'll save it for next time, when we can talk some more then. Yes, Fran. Uh, good-bye, Fran. Good-bye. - Bye. Take off your clothes. I love it when you get bossy. Julie-- We don't have much time today. Make me. Come on, Jules. Catch me first. If you take one step closer, I'll scream. Okay. Okay. All right. Tell me the story. - The story? The story of why David is fixated on nude women... wearing this particular... not-so-spectacular red hat. I'm not a very good storyteller. - I bet you are. Okay. Uncle Davy will tell you a story if-- you promise to take off all your clothes. Well, when you put it like that, how can a girl resist? Okay. Let's see. Story. Not on Uncle Dave's lap. Something's alive down there. Yeah, it's a-- it's a Pogi. Uh, I gotta feed him. A Pogi? - Shit. What do you want? You have to feed him? What is it? It's a... Pogi. Something my wife gave me. I'm supposed to keep him alive for a month. But I-- I'm thinking of hiring a babysitter. Interested? I don't think nude nannies are legal in this country. Don't answer it. He-- Hello? No. No, she's not here. She should be back by 6:00. Great. Yeah, I'll tell her. Bye-bye. - So you were saying? I was? I was, uh-- The hat. Why the ubiquitous hat? Well, let's just say... it's an inscrutable projection... of the cosmic collective unconsciousness. How about that? And, uh, why the color red, Professor Jung? Red, Miss Bell, is the color of torment, passion, uh, flame, birth, death, lust, forbidden fruit, passion-- - You already said passion. Did I? It's a bunch of bullshit anyway. I want the real story. The story, then work. Okay. Let's see. Once upon a time, when I was an older woman-- our next-door neighbor Maggie-- used to come over and check in on me when my parents were out of town. Let me tell it. No, let me tell it. One day she-- Maggie-- comes over to check in on little Davy, who's been out playing soccer with the neighborhood boys. It's a hot, yellow day, and he's brown and dripping with sweat. And Maggie comes over wearing a big red hat... and a flowery sun dress... that clings in the humid air... to every crevice of her voluptuous body. Breasts bursting and "strappy" high-heeled sandals clicking, she comes up the back steps, calling, "Davy! "Davy! It's Maggie. Just comin' over to check in on you." Little Davy peeks around the bathroom door, his towel tied tightly around his narrow, boyish hips. And there's Maggie, staring straight at him. "Oh, Davy. You are a dirty boy." She reaches in a long, cherry-red nail... to his chest... and wipes it across his soft belly... and licks the sweat off her finger. "Why, honey," Maggie purrs, bending down on her knees. "We woke up Davy, Jr." He stands, rigid, pink, sweat-streaked, as she brings her bright red lips... to the tip of his pulsing young manhood. Nailed by terror and adrenaline, all little Davy can see is the top... of the wide-brimmed red hat, bobbing up and down, up and down, up and down. You have some imagination. Don't you wanna fuck me now? Do I want to, or am I going to? Move your hand to the left. Show me where you want it. Oh, uh-- I'm so sorry. I-- I thought you weren't painting today. Did I-- Did I screw up? - No. I'll just leave this right here. - Stay. Stay, please. Uh, I'll get this for you. Julie, you can relax. It's been a long session. I'll get us something to drink. Oh, thanks, love. So, uh, your-- What do you do in your clothed life? You-- Were you an actress, or-- I mean, most of his models... have been actresses or-or-or models or-- I'm a grad student. What are you studying? Writing. - Really? - I'm writing a novel. Oh, uh, about what? Maybe about you. Oh, that will be a very short and dull novel, I'm afraid. Somehow, I doubt that. You didn't happen to... - lose a pair of underwear recently-- - Red, right? Uh-huh. - How embarrassing. I-- I'm sorry. Where'd you find them? Uh, under my bed. Oh! See, I-- I'm not shy at all about posing, but when I first started-- There's something so intimate about dressing and undressing. I hope you don't mind I used your bedroom. Oh, no. No. That must have been weird-- finding a strange woman's skivvies in your space. Um, I'm gonna go get them. Here you go. - Wow. This deserves some tequila. I'm sorry. You'll have to go virgin. It's a nice shade of red. Oh. Thanks. Thanks. I think we should get back to work. I'm sorry. Um, I'm going. So how did you two meet? Um, oh, we actually met right here. It's funny-- - Mary. I'm sorry. I'm going. - No, no, no. Please stay. I-- I've always been fascinated by the chance encounters that lead to love. It's the utterly hopeless romantic in me. I wanna hear how Mary and David met. Please? It's really not that terribly romantic. I mean, uh-- Please? Okay, uh-- I lived here first. And I was moving out, David was moving in, and we kept... bumping into each other, mixing up each other's boxes... until we decided to simplify and consolidate under one roof. That's not exactly how it was. Oh, it's not, huh? No. It was her voice. - Oh! She doesn't want to hear that. - No, I do. I wanna hear all the gory details. She was late moving out-- - I'd gotten the days mixed up. Yeah, and, uh, the door was open, and I was about to walk in when I heard this voice. I was on the phone, right? - Mmm. It sounded like a-- a bubbling brook. You know, soft water over hard rocks. I kept asking myself, "Where have I heard that voice?" I knew this voice-- the rhythm of it, the tone, the bursts of laughter. I wanted to step inside that voice and never leave. Yeah. So I just-- I-- I just stood there, speechless, nailed to the floor. And, uh, I knew from the moment I saw her... that she was the one. He just stood there staring at me... like some big old lug. Wow. That's quite a-- - Oh, he actually... asked me to move in with him that first day, right? That's crazy! - No, I thought you asked me. Oh, here we go again. Wow. That was a great story. Thanks for sharing. Well, um, I promised Stephen... I'll come by the gallery. He wants to show some of my old work. That's crazy. I have to talk him out of that. I'd love to see some of your stuff. Could I come by sometime? Um-- Uh, yes. Yes, sure. Bye. Um-- It's the Stephen Stevens Gallery. David, you can tell her how to get there. So... you don't seem like an unhappily married pair. I never said we were. Well, men give off this vibe. Women have special sensors to read... the "I'm looking to get out of my miserable marriage" signal. Why did you leave your underwear here? I forgot. Women never forget their underwear. I did. Uh-oh. I've lost them again. Oops. Here they are. Take them off. It's... so realistic. Yes. So I've heard. That's not meant to be derogatory in any way. I didn't think it was. I mean, the detail is excruciating. It's so like a-- - A photograph? No, no. A Brueghel. Rotten fruit and insects? Yes. But the observation-- The humanity. The obsessive-compulsive attention to detail. Is this yours? No. - Oh. Well, David, as I said, I do like your work. My art gallery deals with cutting-edge work. What's hot now, today. Not yesterday. Realism isn't now today, but if it's now tomorrow, I'll give you a call. Not a good meeting? - Mmm. I'm just not... now enough. But you evidently are. - What? Carl's waiting with open arms... any time you're ready to fly Stephen's coop. No. Did he say that? I can't believe he said that. Anyway, there are so many other galleries out there, David. You'll just have to be patient. It'll happen. It will. - I'm sick of this fucking scene. David-- - I'm sick of this fucking city! It's gonna be all right. - Don't take care of me. I'm just trying to-- - Shut up! Just let me think. You said shut up to me. I'm sorry. - You said shut up to me. I said I'm sorry, didn't I? - Well, you never say shut up. Mary, do-- Fuck. You-- You want everything to be nice and pretty. Yes. I want-- What's wrong with that? Let me tell you something. Life's not always nice and pretty. If you don't want sand in your eyes, then goddamn it, don't step into a sandstorm. Well, excuse me for caring. You're too big for Stephen. - Oh-- I am not leaving Stephen. Carl's a prick, but he could double your sales. I'm not painting in blood anymore. - What? Mary. Hold on a sec-- Mary. I can't do it. I just can't do it anymore. David, don't look at me like that. I can't get a single goddamned gallery interested in my work, and you-- - And I walked. Do you know how much we owe? Yeah, I'm finally breaking through, I'm finally getting somewhere, and you wanna pull the plug. It's not like I'm giving up painting. It's just that-- What's that? Oh, shit. This shit is driving me crazy. What's wrong? - Well, it won't-- it won't sleep, it won't eat. I think I'm killing him. - It's just a toy, okay? Oh. What's that? - I think he vomited. You're joking. Real sweet. He's barely out of the first grade, and he's already got some incurable disease. David, don't press all the buttons at once. You'll-- You'll crush his circuits. - Let me push! Don't. You'll-- That's it. Now where are you going? My studio. - Mm-hmm. Isn't that what you want? I'm going to paint a big bunch of really big, bloody paintings, and I'm going to sell them for lots and lots of money, and then we're going to live happily ever after. Since when did you start drinking? It's beer. It's only beer. Shut up! Excuse me. I was talking to him. I was talking to our little... boy. - Uh-- I was-- Not you. Right. - I was talking to-- I was talking to him. Oh, man. I'm drunk already. Ms. Shaw? Hi. Fran... Pinkerton. Oh. Um-- Oh. I just wanted to come by to apologize. I didn't want you to think that I was being deceitful or-- I totally thought that you knew who I was. It's all right. No worries. Um, I have someone waiting for me, so, uh-- I read that article about your suicide attempt, and, well, when I was 14, I tried it. Same way, actually. Well, I see it didn't work for you either. No. It didn't. That's a good thing. Yeah. I guess. Mmm. I-- I really have to go. You could come by tomorrow in the afternoon, if you like. We could talk some more. Oh, I would really appreciate that. Yeah. Okay. Bye-bye. - Bye. Hey, Mary, did I tell you that I really, really loved your work? About a dozen times ever since we left the gallery. Would you like a glass of wine? Ever since David stopped drinking, we don't keep any hard stuff around. Sober-- That's tedious. No, actually, it's much better like this. Although he was what you could call a happy drunk. We had some fun times, but, you know. - What's he like in bed? David? I'm sorry. Is that too personal? Oh, well, you know, actually, we are going through... sort of a dry spell, you know. Well, you've been married-- What? Six years? Desire ebbs and flows. It's natural. - Right. Unfortunately, mine is flowing while his is ebbing. In the beginning, he couldn't keep his-- hands off of me. I'm not surprised. - Really? What do you mean? You have a-- a compelling sexual aura. That's a new one. Compelling sexual aura. Oh? - Very compelling. Hmm. - To your compelling sexual aura. Oh. Well, to my compelling sexual aura. All right, then. Some munchies, huh? Mmm. - Mmm. So you were saying about you and David, how it's changed-- Oh, yes. I was saying that, wasn't I? Uh, in the beginning, he practically devoured me. It was almost obscene, the way he'd look at me sometimes. Like I was a piece of raw meat. Oh, I love that look. Oh, no, no. I didn't mean David. No, I mean men. You know? Like, my boyfriend Carlo-- He looks at me like that. You should meet him. We should get together, all four of us. That would be fun. - Oh. Carlo. What is he like? - Oh, very Italian-- Mm-hmm. - and very-- very passionate. Absolutely adores me. - Mm-hmm. It's beginning to irritate the shit out of me. - You're joking. No, he's-- He's rich enough, handsome enough, intelligent, sexy, generous, attentive-- All that. - Sounds... perfect to me. I like my men flawed, you know? With an edge. Women always say that, but they-- they don't really mean it, you know? Nice and stable and devoted are not such bad qualities in a man, after all. I have to admit, it is gratifying to be the center of someone's universe. I am the sun. He is the moon. Oh. David used to make me feel like that. He used to? What happened? I think we stopped trying to... be what we thought the other one wanted us to be. And I stopped pretending to like sex the way-- the way, uh, he wanted me to. Well, nobody should have to pretend. - Mmm. Is he a bore in bed, or what? Uh-- Ooh. He wants me... to hold still. You know? Not to move at all. That's really fucked up. I know. You know, but actually-- I mean, he's really not a necrophile or anything like that. I-- I don't mean-- He's just got some issues. I mean, he-- I've been trying to get him to go to therapy, but-- You're so lucky to have such a profoundly scarred man. Mmm. - Most men are so simple and boring. Hmm. I do have a confession. Ooh. Tell, tell. - Um-- I was extremely jealous of you... when we first met. I, um-- I hated you. God, I hated you. Hated? Oh, what a strong word. Hated. - This is really embarrassing. No, no, no. I love it. I mean, it's so passionate. "Hated." Do you still hate me? No. No. Are you disappointed? A little. But, I mean, why would you be jealous of me? Granted, your husband looks at my naked body all day long, I might as well be a-- an apple... or a-- a pile of lumber. Julie, you are definitely not a pile of lumber, believe me. I think that you underestimate yourself. I mean, you're a-- You're a beautiful, complicated woman. And you... have finally managed to make me blush. So do you think that I flirt with your husband? Tell me the truth. Because I do flirt. I-- I flirt outrageously. It's-- It's all due to a deep insecurity, or so I've been told. No. No, you haven't done anything wrong. It's all in my little sick mind. Okay. I have a confession to make. What? I'm a very bad girl. Bad? Nasty. I'm a nasty girl. I take things that don't belong to me. So, what, are you a kleptomaniac, or what? This... belongs to you, I believe. Did David give that to you? - No. I stole it. I'm a thief. Well, you're giving it back, so it's not really like you're-- - I'm not giving it back. I'm just clearing my conscience. I'm a very bad girl. Yes, of course you're giving it back. - No. He's mine now. He's crying. You have to give him back, or he won't stop. He's mine now. Say bye-bye. Ju-- Julie! Hey, crazy! Um-- What happened? - Nothing. What was she doing here? Oh, visiting. You? - Yes-- me. What's so strange about that? Nothin'. - Are you jealous? Of Julie? Come on. - Mmm. She came to the gallery. Had a really nice chat. We came over here. And why are you so upset, David? Just curious. - Hmm. Does it bother you that I'm getting to know one of your models? That I might have access to that part of your life? No, I just didn't think Julie was your kind of person, that's all. Oh? Why? 'Cause she's fun and hip-- and I'm not? I should be more playful, shouldn't I? You're perfect exactly the way you are. You like me depressed and hostile? I love you depressed and hostile. No, you don't. Anyway, I like Julie. She's-She's-- She's fun. She's a little rough around the edges, but-- - Mmm. But she's extremely attractive, isn't she? Do you want me to paint someone ugly? Yes. For once, I would love it... if you would just paint somebody extremely unattractive. Would you do that for me? Why don't I paint you when you're drunk? Oh, hey, David. - You came back. Do you want to, uh, go to Al's Bar? We could negotiate the return of a certain little hostage. Oh! I'll be right back. Mary, you're already drunk. I'll make sure she gets home safely. She is so sexy. I don't know why you don't wanna make love to your wife anymore, David. We all need affection. - Ready! David, have a good night. - See you tomorrow. We don't have a session tomorrow. - Oh. Yeah. Mary invited me and my boyfriend over for a-- a couple's thing. Oh. - Yeah. We're gonna play Scrabble. I thought you hated Scrabble. I hated losing. Let's go. I gotta go. "In." That's pretty good for an Italian, right? Hey, hey, hey. That's pretty good. - That's great. And to think he's never played before. That's two points for Carlo. Isn't she beautiful? Che bellissima! I fucking love you. I'm crazy about you. I'm the luckiest man in the world. David, you're pretty lucky too, but, hey, I am the luckiest one, okay? Come on. Let's go. I'll make the words. Hey, let's play Strip Scrabble. You're changing the rules in the middle of the game, okay? It's like strip poker. Let's just finish this one. I'll strip for you. It's no problem. Tell me what you want. I'll do anything for you. Should I strip? I'll strip. Would you be a good boy and get me a new margarita? Okay. I'll get it. No, David. Please. You're the host, and I love to take care of my lady. Mary, what about you? Your glass looks a little sad and empty. I will go with you. We're low on salsa. No cheating, David. I'll keep an eye on him. "Bellissima." If he says that one more time-- He has an enormous schlong. I think, why can't I fall in love with a beautiful, sweet, wonderful lady like you are? Aw. - Huh? Aw. That's so sweet of you to say. Mary, I bet you've never even fooled around, right? Carlo, why do we have this discussion? Mary, have you ever fooled around? You don't really want me, Julie. You just like the game. Actually, you're wrong. You pretend to be the ocean, right? Vast, free, available. However, like most women, you're really a swamp. You just want to suck men into your world and drain the life out of them. Nice imagery, David. Oh! Right. David, you are lucky. Your wife is beautiful, and she has the greatest sense of humor. Bravo, Carlo. You have excellent taste in women. Let's continue the game. - Okay. Who makes the word? David, you haven't taken your turn. What have you been doing? S-E-X. One, two, 10, and a double word. Oh. You're only I can't believe it. You must be carrying those letters in your pocket or something. What's wrong? Not once have we played this game... when he didn't end up spelling "sex." Mary, for Christ's sake, it's only a word. Mmm, and it's every time. It's every time. - Is-Is "sex" not a legitimate word? - Everybody, okay. Let's take our clothes off. What? Everybody, "takes" your clothes off! Come on! Go on. Take your clothes off. Oh, my God. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Go ahead and help yourself to some cookies. They're chocolate chip, I think. What about some coffee, actually? Or tea or something. I-- I have such a hangover. Or would you prefer a sandwich, maybe? I can make you one. What are you doing? Oh, don't worry. It's insulin. Did you eat all those cookies? I'm so sorry. I-- I'll replace them. Fran-- Oh, my God! Are-Are you all right? You shouldn't be eating any sweets at all, Fran. I like the trip. What trip? The place I go when I sugar up. I eat sugar, and just as it's about to enter my heart, I know... if I can just hang on one more minute, I could see death. I come so close. I think I saw her once. "Her"? - She was a golden light. She had glowing red hair, like yours. She almost reached out and touched me. And then my mother pumped me with insulin. It's like... being suspended by a string... from a cloud waiting to fall. Fran, just-- Fran, don't eat any more sweets, okay? I know. That's what my mom says. She's always hiding the cookie jar. She really loves me. My dad thinks it's funny. He gives me Tootsie Rolls when she's not looking. I had a question about your artist's statement. Um-- "Mary Shaw has tried to absolve herself... by bleeding onto the"-- No. Fran, whoever you think I am, is not who I am. I am not the one. Some cosmic occurrence put you where you were needed, and we found you. Do you have any, um-- any other hobbies? I used to draw in high school. Really? How-How did that go? Did you enjoy it? Well, they told my mother I had mental problems. They sent me to the school counselor, and he said... my drawings were unhealthy and obsessive. And my mother threw out all my art supplies. Actually, I've started drawing again. My family doesn't know about it. I do it mostly in public restrooms... because it's usually very quiet there, except for the flushing and the bodily functions. But-- Would you like to see them? Oh. Uh, yes. Sure. All of my drawings are here. I keep them with me all the time. I'm petrified my mother might find them. She hates art. You don't like them. Uh-- No, it's just that-- Do you draw from your imagination, or-- Oh, no. I'm not that good. A friend of mine works at the mortuary. She helps me set these up after hours. We just reattach the body parts when we're done. Once they're in the casket, they don't move around. You don't like them. - Oh. They're just, um, a little, um, violent. Whoa! But you-- You've got talent, Fran. I mean, you're really quite good. I have an idea. Why don't you take your work down to my gallery... and show them to-to my dealer, Stephen Stevens. He loves to meet young up-and-coming artists like yourself. You mean me? You would do that for me? Well, yes, Fran. Why not? Oh, my God. This is a dream. Mary Shaw mentoring me-- Me, Fran Pinkerton. I-I-- I'm so honored. Fran, it's really not a big deal, okay? I-- I'll go see Mr. Stevens today. I mean, why wait, right? I'm trying to be more proactive in my life. I read Tony Robbins. He's a misogynistic pig, but he's got some good advice. Well, um, good-bye, Fran. Um-- You're an angel, Mary. No. Tequila first. Then ice cream. Then chocolate. Hot, cold, sweet. Hot, cold, sweet. It's based on an ancient alchemical principle of pleasure. This is absolutely, really, seriously... the last one, all right? - Okay. To corny, horny Italians. I, um-- I hear that... Italian men are really good in bed. Italian women are better. They understand the ancient art of cunnilingus. Julie. You just love trying to shock me, don't you? I'm really not such a prude, you know. - I didn't think you were. So you also date women? Isn't this a date? - You know what I mean. Are you? I mean-- You're bisexual? I don't know if there's a word for what I am. Sensualist. That's a good one. Have you ever had a serious relationship with a woman? I had a fling with a girl in college, but it was an all-girl school, so it was part of the curriculum. I've never been with a woman. Never? - No. Ever been curious? I suppose, as an intellectual exercise, yes. What do you think about when you masturbate? What? I don't-- That's a tiny, teeny little bit too personal, okay? Oh. Um-- You have some, um-- Julie! Every woman thinks about it. We begin by falling in love with our own bodies. The softness, the curves, the mysteries. The feeling of our delicate fingertips, the-- the feeling... of our tongue against our skin. And we wonder, what must it feel like to do this to someone else? To make her feel the things I'm feeling. Touch the tips of breasts-- succulent, but not our own. To nibble, lick, caress another pussy. Julie, I am not interested in having an affair with you. Come on, before it melts. I was just teasing you. I didn't mean to frighten you. You did not frighten me. I'm just-- I'm very clear-- I'm, um-- I'm a heterosexual. Of course you are. That's why we exist, isn't it? To breed. Hmm. I think I'm done. How about you? For now. Well, shit, Mary. What do you want me to do? Mm-mmm. You're either painting or you're not painting. There's no such thing as kind of-- kind of painting. I want you to admit that you're going through a crisis. Okay, you know what? This conversation's over. Good-bye. Where's my egg salad? What? - Aren't you the new intern? I'm Fran Pinkerton. - Who? I'm a friend of Mary Shaw's. Okay. And? She wanted me to show you some of my new paintings. Oh. Yeah. That's very sweet and cute and all, but, um, I have a full slate of clients right now, and I'm-I'm really busy, so-- Maybe we could do this another time, okay? Have a great day. Look. I've been very busy myself creating the Bloody Marys. The Bloody Marys? That's you? - Yeah. You've heard of us? Uh-huh. Okay. So I neglected myself and my art, and Mary helped me see that. And I'd really appreciate it if you would look at my paintings, okay? Yeah. A minute of your time. Okay. Don't lose your temper. I'd be delighted to. You don't like them. Huh? Uh-- No, no. Um-- No-- No, that's not it. It's-- I am a little surprised. - Oh. Mr. Stellar, come see what I've done. Wow. Wow. It's just as if, uh, I've seen them somewhere before. Oh, David, I think Fran meant them to be similar to my work. Oh, no, I didn't mean them to be similar. I meant them to be exact. If I may be so bold, I think I've rendered them perfectly. I used your catalog. Did you use blood? - Of course. I feel as if we were one. Cut from the same cloth. Shouldered from the same arm. Chiseled from a single piece-- Ultimately, Fran, we're all one in some way, aren't we? No, I meant us-- You and me. I am your spiritual sister. Fran, go home. Get some sleep. Uh, you look terrible. I thought we could do a two-person show, you know, after your new series, of course. Mr. Stevens said it could be, like, an out-of-body phantasmagoria. Do you know what he meant by that? Because he's very metaphysical, that guy. He's very bright for a man. I think that he just-- Fran-- Fran? Fran's all right? - Mmm. They had her on intravenous, but she'll be going home today. Thanks for checking in on her. Mmm. Look, uh, I know this is going to screw up your schedule totally, but I would like to postpone the show for a while. I have an idea. - Mmm? Would you show David's paintings? Actually, uh, this crisis you say that you're not going through... that you're going through got me... worried. And, um, I booked a backup. You did? Who? - Mm-hmm. Fran. Your protg. Uh-- Wait a minute. We could call it, uh, "Mary Revisited," or "Mary"-- "Bloody Mary Does Mary." - You mean those clones? Those miniature Xerox copies of my work? - "Mary Cloned." That's brilliant. - You're serious? You're serious? Oh, my God-- Stephen. Oh. That must be, uh, Paula. You should fold this. Hey, Paula, I'm out the door right now. Okay, bye, Mary. But she copied me! Oh. Hi. - Good morning. You know what I think you should do? - What? Take a vacation. My friend has a house in the mountains. You can go stay there. I mean, it's minuscule, but there's a great view of the trees. And I can come up and cook for you. You cook? - Yes, I cook. I'm shocked. You really think that... I spend my days masturbating and dousing myself in essential oils? That's your own fault. That's what you want people to think about you, isn't it? How astute of you, Mary. Well, I'm turning over a new leaf. I'm going to be very serious. Just takes a little practice. What's wrong? Your head hurt? Um, yeah. I should get an aspirin or something. I know some headache pressure points. Uh-- Ouch! It's supposed to hurt. Everything good for you hurts a little. Is that so? - Yes. Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's great. Oh! Yeah, just-- Do you know what? Forget cooking for me. Just massage me all day long. I'd pay a fortune for hands like yours. Well, I'm not about to part with them. We could negotiate a temporary release. Mm-hmm. Mary? Oh, wait. No, no. Uh-- Oh, no, no, no, no. I wasn't, um-- I'm s-- I didn't mean to make you think that-- I wasn't leading you on. I-- I like you Julie, but I-- I'm married, Julie. He-- He doesn't love you. You can't say that. Don't-Don't say that. You don't know that. Mary, I love you. I don't know how this happened, but... I love you. You hate me, don't you? - No. No, Julie-- I like you so much. - I mean, you're not going to-- What if it was good between us? What if it was really good? Wouldn't you wanna... find out? Julie, I mean, love is so much more complicated... than just... sex. I-- I wasn't talking about sex. Forget it. Oh. Um-- Oh, man. Where's it-- Pogi? Where's it-- Where's it coming from? Somewhere around here. Where is he? Here he is. He's blinking a lot. Never seen that before. - Me either. What does it mean? - I don't know. Where's the manual? Well, I don't know. - Um-- Oh. Here it is. Shit. It's too late. He's dead. - Did you kill him? Me? - Well-- Come on. I thought we were both responsible for him. Look in the index, David. Look. - Mary, come on. Maybe we can start all over-- get a new battery, or reprogram him or something. Look, David. Hurry! - What do I look under? Reincarnation? He's gone-- Give it up. Come on. - No, he's not. I don't want to give it up. I do not want to give-- I want it to work. Please make it work, Dav-- Make it work, David. Oh, sweet Lord. - Please, just do something. Please. It's a toy, for God's sake! It's a piece of shit. It's a toy. You can't say that. David, what are you doing? You can't throw him away! What-- Oh-- For God's sake! Give it up! You're driving yourself crazy with this shit. It's a fucking toy! You never wanted one, did you? - What? You say you do, but you don't. If I was really pregnant, you'd want me to get rid of it, wouldn't you? Oh, Jesus! You don't want to go there right now. Let's not do this, okay? - You'll never be ready, will you? We'll never have enough money and we'll never have a real family, will we? Why do you even stay married to me? What's the point? Or is it because I'm the only one paying the bills? That's really convenient, isn't it? I mean, any guy would be fucking crazy-- fucking crazy-- to give up this setup. Oh, David, I'm-- I'm just so tired. I'm gonna go lie down, okay? Thanks. Don't paint her. Who do you want me to paint? You? Do you know what you want? Uh-- I'll come back in a few more minutes. David. Lemonade. But only if you squeeze it fresh. And lots of sugar. David? Listen to this. This is insane. "...and awash in the Baroque paintings of Mary Shaw, "the work of Fran Pinkerton has exploded into the art world... "with much more fire, more promise, "and more content in its message... than the original seed from which it was sprouted"-- "Original seed"? What am I, a pod or s-- Oh, hi. - Hey. I was-- Where's David? Um-- Listen to this. It's about Fran, right? Um-- "Pinkerton's art goes far beyond replication, beyond reinterpretation"-- I mean, try Kinko's. "To call it a layer removed from reality would be too obvious. "Pinkerton's genius lies in the distortion of the world... "as the artist sees it into a distinct and separate plane, "a plane which exists simultaneously... in a Star Trek-ian time-space continuum." Wow. Is David, um, in the bathroom? I need something to drink. Would you like something? David? Mary? Please-- Please don't-- - Shut up, Julie. Mary, it's me. I'm fucked up. I don't want to hear it, okay? Mary-- Mary, wait. Mary! - No. I, um-- Let go of me, David! Don't touch me! Mary, please! Don't you ever touch me again! Mary! Fuck! # Hide, hide by my side # # Cool wind in your hair # # Will you be as bright # # Or everybody's to share # # Or everybody's to share # # Hide with me # # Far out at sea # # Hide away # # Stay, please # # Stay # Hi. Um-- Hi. Where have you been? I've been walking. I was here earlier, and you weren't here and-- I-I just got in. I've been... cleaning. I was just really worried. I went-- I went walking. Kept thinking about... color. I was trying to replace all of my thoughts with color. But everywhere I looked, everywhere I turned, all I could see was red. And all I could feel was hatred and rage and-- I went to the park, lay down in the grass. Suddenly, I heard this voice inside of my head going, "Enough. That's-- That's enough." Something shifted inside of me, and everything looked different. I want to feel the way I felt in the park, David. I want to feel that way all the time. I haven't done that since I was a child. I used to lay there... and look up in the sky. Dream that my prince would come and rescue me. Make me happy. I'm not doing a very good job of that, am I? It's not your job. I'm really sorry.
