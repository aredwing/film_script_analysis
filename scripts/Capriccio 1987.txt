Hey Jennifer, look ! - Your Italian over there ! - My Italian ? Yes... waiter ! Is he. Then I can say it is just another nice Italian. I knew that none of us would have had a relationship with an Italian. There was a relationship with a black. The idea that the Italian of mine could be taboo.... I was wanting more, and I tried to refuse. This is a special filling, be sure that you try ! - Taste ! - No, thank you ! - Do it for me ! - Go away ! - Please go ! - Why ? Look at me, the shame ! Who is ashamed? you or me? Don't be ridiculous ! - I love you! - You don't know me. - Do you think you need to know? - No more nonsense ! I want to marry you. !

Give me that, I'll do it ! Look! You can watch! I'm finished ! Well shouldn't it be enough ! I have to be careful ! You are great! Yes, I believe it's true? This is salt water ! It cost my hat.

I have a villa on a hill that you should see. - Please be my guests tonight. - Thank you, but we still have much to do. What a pity ! - You look like a nymph! - What is a nymph? In ancient mythology, nymphs were nature's personification. You are a nymph of the forest. A nymph of nature, the mountains. Instead of taking of pictures of ruins, take pictures of me? - You could sell pictures in America! - That's an idea! It may be so materialistic.. I say it for you. Great idea, I am thinking. If you want pictures with nimfa rosalia, you must pay ! - Am I beautiful? - Yes! As beautiful as paradise! Do you know who was called that ? diomira, my mother! When I was a small, men chanted. A invitation for it. Was alfredo your father? No... Alfredo was deflorat ! What are you, have you been bewitched ? With love. I wrote this letter ten days ago. You have no love. Why didn't you replied, ciro ? Why? This morning I went back to our room of the boarding house. Beside our bed I produced a pleasant plan ! why do you make Me suffer, Ciro ?

If we were husband and wife, you could touch me anytime you want. you wake up in the middle of the night... Your hand and I find p.... - My boyfriend... ! - Wait ! First, tell me you love me. If I didn't love you, do you think we'd have done all this ? Slowly ! Very slowly ! Slow... ! You must feel it.... ! Now, stop! Don't think of anything ! Sit down ! No.... ! Why, Ciro ? Why, why, why... ? You must tell me that you can't live without me. I cannot, cannot live without you ! That's good. You can start again ! - Do you feel it? - I feel it... ! - I can no longer resist, ciro! - Wait! Don't finish. We have to do it together ! Yes, I'll wait! Tell me when you want ! Now, Jennifer ! Now.... ! My boyfriend.... ! I love you.... ! turn your back, ciro! Then ask me again ! I beg of you, I can no longer be without you ! Do you have another answer to what I told you to Naples. What do you mean ? I told you that I want to be with you ! Don't be a fool, Ciro ! Do you think I'm mad ? I want us to be together ! First, we should wait until the end of the war ! I want to be with you.. First over the eating of great fruit ! You were right, Ciro! I wanted to marry you, to be with you. Please forgive me, because I couldn't do it then ! Now I am willing to do everything! I swear, everything ! There are moments in which I feel that my work is unimportant! Some asked me why I do work like that? It is not at all, do not believe it ? In any case, I like life ! - Slow down. Look! - What is it? A dance... ! Stop ! I want to dance ! I am tired, I stayed behind with the thing. Must be... - If you don't want to come, I am going alone! - You aren't... ! - Oh... ? - Nothing, nothing... ! - You want a drink? - No, I want to dance! - When did he appear and why? - I don't know ! - Bourbon, scotch and a beer ! - Immediately, sir ! Now you dance with me ! - I dance with who I want! - Hey, don't just cut ! - Come on ! - I'll show you! Look here ! He'll kill him... ! Leave him alone, he is an American ! Go and help him, Jack ! Stop ! Get out of the parry ! You get out of here, American ! enough, you go back to America ! Do you as all the others? Do you give orders ? And what do you want? I like you. Good... ! - The country of shit, I have cut tires. - Good luck with my car! And during the war we helped the Americans. They were nice guys in business, but the women were fools. - What do you mean? - Nothing ! - Say what you want, I won't do anything. - Listen, American ! It was a good time for business. I bought materials left by the war. An true American could make a sackful of money. Why not start a business together ? It is better to forget about women, otherwise you will get nothing. Like Clark Gable, who danced with her. He was the best in the business. Soon, he went bankrupt. I understand that times have changed. Remember, you can make money. Even if you weren't a hero. You understand what I mean, americani ? You must take advantage of this situation before the situation takes advantage of you. No one took advantage of me ! Of course, you are informed and you now know what you have to do. I want to tell you something! They comes a time in which a whore is only a whore. - Mrs. Jennifer ! - Yes !

Tell don Vincenzo I will meet him at the market, near the church. Thank you so much! Good-bye ! They are all at the church, for the holiday. I called a taxi, to see the doctor. Don Vincenzo, Duccio is sick. We need a doctor ! He's in the church with the others ! Look, there he is ! Ciro.... ! Jennifer ! What a surprise! What are you doing here ? Stella, Lietta, come here ! This is Jennifer, a friend from the war ! This is Stella, a royal dignitary ! What a beautiful combination ! We must celebrate! delighted, and Lietta! Foreign Secretary ! She is a executive secretary. Ciro's secretary! Let's all go to the restaurant Marin. There have the best oysters. Beautiful, I'm crazy for oysters! Let's go! - I would like.... - What ? - Why didn't you answer the letters? - The letters? I haven't received a letter ! - Nor did I know that you came. - That's why I have written the letter. At the reception at excelsior. It said you will arrive ! I waited two weeks. day and night! You were here and you did not even try to see me. What are you saying, Jennifer ? I came with them long ago ! Please ciro, I want us to stay together tonight ! - Are you mad? How can I do that? - You are with them ? - What is wrong with you? - Nothing! I can explain. The star shows where I work. Listen, Mrs. Jennifer! - Ciro is a stinking shit! He is a Playboy. He keeps a lot of women ! - What are you talking about? - But he is nice, isn't he? - You see that he says nothing, Mrs. Jennifer? - You can shut up ? A gigalo ! Why on earth do you laugh, Lietta ? You pay them, don't you ? What do you think I am? - I'll see you tomorrow! - Tonight, please! - I must leave in a little while. - OK, serenella villa! - But not before a few hours! - Swear that you will come ! I swear ! Jennifer... believe me I want to very much! Here's what I'll do! I'll leave my watch ! It is a promise ! And what do you want me to do ? It is all I have! I'll take it only to have the pleasure to give it back to you . - What beautiful times! - When ? The day on which we met, you hair waved back and forth... She was called Jennifer. It's so ? Who was the boy? Your beau ? Yes, my beau ! What are you doing washing laundry? We must go back to Rome. You soiled my pajamas, and now I have to wash it. You say you have extended the mission ? Do you like being a housewife ! Don't be afraid that I want to marry you. It is better that way. I thought you had invented a story. - Yes? What kind of story? - Our story! - Why should I? - A woman needs a story. - What about the men? - No, not when he gets paid. Poor Fred! The Jeep was right. Times have changed when a whore is a whore and both. - I'm going out to make a phone call. - That's good! Go telephone Arthur ! It could be a story ! There was nothing serious. He was just achy. You did well to call ! Excuse me, I lost it and panicked ! When I arrived, Duccio had already felt better. - I'm hungry! - Let's go, Don vincenzo !

You and I in America ! I'll keep you in hand. It is like a procurer... ! I'll call him Ciro ! It is an innocent love ... ! I assure you Jennifer, your Italian is nice ! Do as I say ! He is a stinking Playboy.... He maintains lots of women. What would you like to be ? That's it! What's up! Lester, love Dad ? Duccio, what a nice boy... You are still pale ! Do you like it? Go to your rooms ! Good-bye ! You look different with you hair up... ! I fixed my hair before we left. It's as if I saw your neck for the first time, now ! It's appetite for this body ! Answer, I am sure it's for you. I am not expecting any telephone call. How about you ? Hello ! I know where your letters are ! Excuse me, I do not understand! With who do you want to talk ?
