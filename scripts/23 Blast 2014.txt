I want you to take a look at your buddies down the bench. Go on. Now do you see any difference between you and them? Nothing? Not a thing? - What's your name, son? - Ashley. Ashley? Ashley. Ashley, can you tell Freddie what's wrong? Your shoulder pads. They go under your shirt. It's going to be a long season. I loved that 1982 team. Championship game was incredible. I was on the sidelines. And why can't we do that again? - Do what? - Win a championship. You've won one, why not two? I've won two, but who's counting... Coach just take over for a minute right? All right, you heard the coach. Form two, two lines over there. Mr. Marshall agrees, together, we can do it. Weren't you going to get me a beverage or something? Oh, yeah, I'll get your soda. Did you say diet? No. No, of course not. Stupid of me. Diet. Stupid. I'll be right back! What was that? A pain in my neck, mainly. He teaches math over at the middle school. Yeah, well, he's the new Athletic Director now. - You kidding? - I wish I was. Well, how in heck did that happen? Well, some bull about the board wanting a football program succession plan. Huh. It doesn't hurt that his uncle's on the board. Oh. Quarterbacks, I don't need you to fire it. Freddie, let's fix those pads. Hi, I'm Travis. - I'm Jerry. - Can you throw? Can you catch? They aim to replace me. What? Are they firing you? No, Willard, I'm retiring. They just want to name my successor. What they don't realize is, I already know who the next football coach at Corbin is going to be. - And I'm looking at him. - Me? Willard, do you want to coach Pee Wee league the rest of your life? I want you to go at about fifty percent, just a little jog, okay. Hut. Travis, that's too fast. - Whoa! - Ooh! - Wow! - That'll do. - Who're those boys? - That's boy's name is Travis Freeman. - He's, um, Jerry Baker. - Here, Coach. Now those two boys were born to play football. Running backs and straight ahead, you can run a straight line can't you? - Yes, sir! - What's this play called? - 23 Blast! - Why do we call it that? The 2 back runs through the 3 hole! All right, bring it in. One, two, three... Red Hounds! All right, let's go. - Travis. - Yes, coach. - Does Jerry know the plays? - Uhh, yeah, pretty much. Well, you know 'em real good. So you'll help him out, right? 23 Blast! 23 Blast! And 23 Blast! Ready! Break! Fingertips! Down! Cameron, get your butt down! Set! Hut! Whoo! Travis, meet at the top. I don't know why Coach Farris puts up with you, but I will not. I don't want to lose this, Mr. Duncan. You know what this is? If I find contraband, Mr. Baker, I will have you expelled. No, sir, this is an article about my friend, here. "Travis Freeman, the Redhound star everything man, has his team on the fast track to the..." Empty your pockets. "He catches touchdowns, he runs for touchdowns, he's the heart and soul of the team. Blah blah, blah." Nothing about the handsome quarterback, Jerry Baker. Why is that, Mr. Duncan? Because you're not worth writing about. - Mr. Freeman. - Yes sir? I suggest you find new friends, you don't want to end up in prison. One day you're going to go too far! He's been after me since 5th grade. He used to say I was cheating in Math. - You were cheating in Math. - I didn't cheat! - You copied off my paper. - Yeah. Off of you. That's friends. Don't count. - Guess who! - Hi, Molly. - Oh, man! - Aw, you're going to make me late! Make sure you score a touchdown for me now. Okay, I'll try. Hey, I don't think your music is supposed to arrive before your car. You know, it gets me all pumped up for the game. You know what, I forgot to ask, how'd that Math exam go? Aced it. Ooh, you're my favorite son. Mom, I'm your only son. That must be why you're my favorite. - Get out of here. - Oh! You gotta be quicker if you want one of those. I'm going to get in your sleep. Yeah, right. - Kick butt, Trav! - Thanks, Ashley. Hey, don't forget my touchdown! Don't forget my touchdown! Oh, hey, Ashley. Good, Karen, you're here. Can you take a look at that? Something's wrong with that pen, it keeps falling off my sweater. You want to get started on the chili for me? You got it. Thank you, dear. - Hey, Mr. Freeman. - Ashley. You got my camera, missus? Got it all charged up. Don't forget to press record. Hey. Hey, Burley, you listen to me, he hasn't missed a single game, and he's not going to miss one now because he's got a runny nose. If his fever's gone, he can play. Feel him. Go on, feel him. - Huh? Cool as a cucumber. - You feeling all right, Cameron? He has got to play. My boy has got to play. I'm ready, coach, I'm ready to play. - Are we ready? - Ready. - Are we ready? - Ready! - Redhound! Redhound! - Pride! Pride! - Redhound! - Pride! Ah! Tonight it's the Corbin Redhounds hosting the Lynn Camp Wildcats. The Redhound defense doesn't give up many big plays and that's the way head coach Willard Farris likes it. The Wildcats will have to pick their spots tonight. The 4 & 1 Redhounds boast a high powered offense led by Junior Travis Freeman. Corbin Redhounds! Corbin Redhounds! Let's go! Lee rip zip, 34 power, strong wing left. Go on. - I'm gonna get closer. - Okay. I'll be over there in a second. Get in there, son! Come on, Cam! Hey, Marshal. How's little Cam feeling? Back to normal, eating me out of house and home. Yeah. Well, you know, they're growing boys. How you all feeling tonight? I want my touchdown! Touchdown, Redhounds! - What happened, who scored? - Travis! Travis, I missed his touchdown? Touchdown Redhounds! Travis Freeman. - How did he score? - He ran it in. - Nah, I think it was a pass. - 23 Blast! 23 what? Okay, I test Fred on all the plays, so that when they put him in he's ready. Whatever it was, Larry's got it on tape. I'm not so sure he does. Panther right, 40 lead, 46 power, go on. How much time we got? Uh, we're fine. Where's the party tonight? - Quit messing around, call the play. - No fun. Okay. Dang, I can't remember... Oh, well. Trav, go deep. - Come on Jerry. - What's the play!? Hey! You guys want to win this game or not?! Let's do combo right. Z left. You guys do whatever. You get in the end zone. And you, give me some time. - On one. Ready? - Break! That's not the play you called, Willard. Black 22, black 22. Set. Hut. - He's open. He's open. - Okay. Pull, pull! That's Travis Freeman once again on a pretty pass from quarterback Jerry Baker. Bold call from Coach Willard Farris, but it worked. Davey Crockett, you ever change my plays again, I will bench you fast. He's got the Redhounds and his workhorse firing on all cylinders. Good job, man. - He call you Davey Crockett again? - Yeah. You think I should tell him it's not my name? - It's a good name. - Hey, hey Marlow. This game's not over. Now, get your head in the game, there's another half. Come on! Come on! Come on! - That was a heck of a throw. - Yes, sir. - Did he forget the play? - Yes, sir. - You all right? - Yes. This headache is just getting worse! - Do you want to leave? - No, no, I'll be fine, it's just, uh... Ew! Get off me. - Loser. - Do all the cheerleaders love me, or is it just Molly? - Your dad know you're here? - You kidding? I'm studying with you! You can't hang with me. I'll beat you at keg stand too. - He better not mess up this year. - He'll be fine. He still doesn't even know the plays! - Look, he gets mixed up once in a while... - I mean it. He can't be screwing up my scholarship. You're always covering for him. I got one shot, one. And he's ain't going to mess that up. Seven, eight, nine, ten! You better control your boy or I will. - Redhounds, baby! - Hey, Jerry, come on. - You and me man, Redhounds. - Hey. Me and you, we're going to state. Hey! Okay, that's your friend Jerry. Whoa! Dad! Let's see what's going on here. When did you notice the swelling? This morning. Close your eyes for me. Now open. Is this from football? No, Travis has a great deal of infection visible in the sinus area. Infection, where did that come from? It's hard to tell. I want to get Travis started on medication right away. Dr. Connelly wants me to prep a surgical room. What's happening? Travis's infection is not responding to medication. His face is swelling and his temperature has risen to 106. - Oh, dear Lord! - We need to get him into surgery quickly. I'll have more answers when I get in there and see what we're up against. - Here he is. Here he is. - Oh, Travis! Hi, baby! You're gonna have to take that cross off. Yes, ma'am. Okay, I got it. I got it. Hi, honey. Mama's right here. Okay? - Hey. - Hmm. I'll see you soon. - I'm going to be fine, Mom. - Now! - Okay. - I'll be fine. All right, he'll be fine. Travis, I need you to count backwards for me from 100. 100, 99, 98, 97... Go deep! Go deeper! Deeper! Hello! Hello! - Oh, Travis. - Mom? Travis. We're right here. Mom, no, I can't see. What... Honey, listen, the doctor explained to us - that you... - Dad! - I'm here. - Why can't I see? Travis. Explain what, Dad? You're blind, son. What do you mean I'm blind? You lost your eyesight. Okay. Okay, for how long? I don't understand. There was too much infection. I can't be blind! No, Mom. It's okay, baby. It's gonna be okay. Dad. We'll get through this. You see that? You heard? I'm gonna need you to stay focused. I'm focused. Okay, you're focused. I'm going to need to step up. Team needs a leader. Are you that guy? Thank you for coming, really. I'll make sure Travis knows that each of every one of you were here. Take care, okay? He's getting better. He's just not up for visitors yet. I'm sorry. - Sorry. - Come here. I know the last thing you want to do right now is play football. Like it or not, we got a game. I don't know why things like this happen to good people. I don't know. I do know, Travis would not want any of you to use his misfortune as an excuse for not playing your best, for not playing just the way you would, if he was out there with us. That's what he expects from us and that's all we can do for him. So we're going to dedicate this game to Travis. Bring it in. - Travis on three. - One, two, three. Travis! Baker is trying to signal his receiver, there is some confusion on the line with another delay... Come on, man! He bumped into the guard. Throw it away! Hello? Bingo! Ah! - What are you doing? - What're you doing, man? - It's an inside curl. - He's supposed to cut out. - Shut your mouth. - It's inside. I love them Redhounds. Love 'em but, boy, my heart can't take another season like last one. Disappointment. Redhounds are a big disappointment. They let us down again. Open, right there. Oh! I'm sorry, sweetie, that bite was too big. - That's all right. - Okay, here we go. - No... - Oh! Travis! No, it's disgusting, those are not eggs. - Oh, honey! - Orange juice. Right here. - Oh, the straw is right here. - Mom, I got it. Mom, I know where the straw is, thank you. Okay. Jerry! How did you get past the nurse? Oh, I can be sneaky sometimes. Hey, Trav. Yeah, I know, I know you don't want any visitors. I don't blame you. Some of them people are like sandpaper. Some of them people are real snoozers. And what makes you think you ain't one of them? Oh! Good, I thought you might have been deaf, too! It's okay, Mom. Jerry can stay. Oh, what, like he's going to kick me out? I was thinking about it. Jerry, do you think maybe you could stay with Travis for a little while? I have an errand to run. Sure. I won't be long. - Ha ha ha... - Really? - Just checking. - Well, how'd you do? Ah, we did all right. We didn't make playoffs. I know all that, how did you do? Oh, you know me, I'm did good. Well, they moved me to second string, but... What? They put Freddie in over you! How'd that happen? I don't know. Farris never liked me. Farris loves you. Come on, let's get out of here. Oh, hey, check out the nurses. Whoa, babe on the left. - Blonde, brunette? - Nope, redhead. She's a cutie too. Look left and smile sexy. I still got it. Oh, sweet shades. - Here, put these on. - What? - Here. - Ow! - When I say jump, jump. - Wait, what? Jump! Let me ask you something. Did we just make fools of ourselves? - Yes, pretty much. - Yes! Hey, meet me at the top. - What's blind like? - It is weird. It's pretty scary, man. It's like having your eyes closed and you can never open them. I'm sorry, man. You're going be fine, man, all right? You're Travis Freeman. Dr. Sanders report to ICU. Dr. Sanders report to ICU. You need to fill out these forms. We'll set up a referral meeting, and come up with an intervention plan for your son. An intervention plan? The sooner we start the process, the sooner we'll find a place for Travis. Travis has a place, in our home. Mrs. Freeman, you need to realize, you no longer have a normal son. Let me help you. It's your first time home, maybe you want to try using the cane. It's right here, sweetheart. I don't want to use it. Come in. - Hey. - Hey, coach, how are you? Come on in, please. Close the door. Have a seat. Willard, I want you to know you have my support. - Thank you, Jasper. - Let me finish. You have my support, if you want to drop Baker from the team. Jerry? Drop him? What gave you that idea? Baker is just the worst kind of bad egg, always trying to get away with something. - He's trouble. - Look, I will agree with you, Jerry is a challenge, but football is the only thing the boy has. - You benched him. - Yeah, I know I did. He lost his way, but who knows he won't figure it out. Willard, your contract is up after next year, isn't it? If Baker becomes a distraction, you have a remedy. Don't you? Kentucky Mobility Center, may I help you? Yes. One moment, please. Travis Freeman. Oh, good, you're back. How did it go? Waste of time. I'm not going back. Well, that's fine. An hour there and an hour back, and he walks out on the woman after 15 minutes. - And you say it's just fine. - He didn't like her, Larry. 15 minutes, and the women is supposed to be his mobility coach, assigned to him by the state! Who else is going to teach him how to get along? - We'll figure it out. - It's been almost three months and he's barely left his room. Mary, we have to talk about a special school for the boy. He's not ready for that. - I'll teach him myself. - No, you can't. We have no experience with this. No, and that's final. Just hear me out for a second. Yes, can I help you? Mrs. Freeman, I'm Patty Wheatley. - Sorry? - Travis's mobility coach. Oh, I'm so sorry. We just never expected to see you here. Travis has missed two appointments. Where is he? Well, he's in his bedroom, but I'm afraid you've come all this way for nothing. Where's his room? Travis? Is it in this way? You know what? I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. In accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990, the state Kentucky will allow no disabled child to be deprived of a free public education. I have not deprived my son of anything. - Mom. - Travis, its okay. - Hey, Travis, remember me? - Oh, not you again. - I'll be in my room. - Well, we can start there. - Miss Wheatley, hey. - Whoa! - His, uh, cane looks unused. - Mom. Does your husband stack his dirty dishes in the bedroom? - Well, of course not, but Travis... - Why should you allow your son - to treat your home like a pig sty? - Because... oh! Wow. Do you do your own cleaning? Because I don't really care what it looks like. Well, let's open a window. Wow! Oh, that's better. Football player, huh? You figure that out all by yourself? - What's that? - Nothing. Yeah. Well, listen up, pal. You got two options here: You can stay in your little, safe, protected environment or you can get up off your sorry, little can and figure out how to whip this. It doesn't make any difference to me. Just don't waste my time. Son of a... Hey, well, you know what that means, it's your Redhound report. Get your teeth off my legs. For the next 60 minutes, I'll answer your calls and tell you with just three months till kickoff whether this year's Redhound Team has what it takes to make the playoffs. Here you are. Oh, Ashley, thank you so... you are a life-saver. It's all right. I also have your change. - Oh, thank you, sweetie. - You're welcome. Oh, you need me to take that sandwich into Travis? No, no, I can take care of it. His dad is taking him to Lexington in a little bit and... No, I would love for you to take this into Travis. I bet he'd like talking to you. All right. Travis? Trav? Trav. Trav. Hey, Trav! Oh, sorry. Ashley? Hey. - Why are you here? - No reason. Nice hat. - How are you doing? - Just great. Brought you some lunch. I'm good, thank you. I'm not hungry. All right, well... Thank you. Oh, Travis, you smell so bad. When is the last time you showered? Just get up, change your shirt. Come on get up, get up. Get up. I think that's clean. Here. I need you to give me the shirt... Oh, um, yeah, I'm... Um, just give me one second. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - How is Molly doing? - Oh, uh, she's good. She, um, says hi and she misses you and sends her love. - Really? - No. Of course not, she's a brat, Travis. - Uh-oh, someone's jealous. - I'm jealous? Yeah, because you want to be a cheerleader. - Yeah, yeah. - Hmm? - What's that? - What? I feel a breeze, it's in my knees, it's in my hips, it's on my lips. Bang, bang, ding, ding, come on Redhounds, do your thing. You better knock it off, or else. I could smack you. Ready? Dad? Ashley's here, sorry. Ashley. Guess who? Opposite foot, opposite foot, it's like kicking the can. There you go, there you go. Now, hold your arm out straight. No, your cane arm out straight, out straight. Hold your arm out straight, there you go. Keep your head up, keep your head up. - What's the point? - Keep your head up. Opposite foot, there you go. - Shirts on the right. - Okay. Pants are on the left. Khakis and jeans, feel the texture. - Keep your arm out straight. - Why? You okay? Yes, ma'am, arm out straight. Arm out straight. Let's go and find the washer and dryer. - Ow! - Son of a gun. - Keep your hand out. - Sorry. $16.50 is your change. Would you mind counting the bills out for me. Sure. That's ten, five and one. Thank you. So that's your school, huh? Yeah. Gonna miss it. What about your senior year? I guess I'll be going to school for the blind. - Is that what you want? - Do I have a choice? 212 on your right, 213 on your left. You can get your books on audio tape. Your teachers can give you your the tests orally. Hey, it's impolite to stand with your back to the person who you're talking to. Sorry. Yeah. There won't be anybody to guide you. You'll be on your own. Good, because I don't want any special treatment. No one's allowed in school on a weekend without special permission. Goodness, could've sworn it was a Monday, my bad. Well, this is your stop. You're not gonna walk me in? I have orders from Patty. Good morning, Travis. Welcome back. Thank you. - My man. - Hey, what's up? - How you're doing? - I'm good. Why don't you take a picture, it'll last longer. Your first class is in what? - 213? - 213. Should be right here on the left. - What class is this? - Calculus. - Where you are headed? - I got sheet metal 101. - What class is that? - AP, pre-prison, taught by Duncan. See what happens when you're not around? Later. Later. Drixen runs up the gut, no, it's a fake. He's wide open. Jerry overthrew him, bad. What was that? Cover somebody, you got to cover somebody, son. - Its cover three. - Yes, sir. Baker, my niece can throw a ball better than that and she's only four years old. You content to be the backup now, is that it, huh? Is Coach Farris always this happy? If he didn't yell, he didn't like you. All of you, what the heck is wrong with you people? Our first game is in ten days. That's it! I've had it with you all. Suicide drill, coach, run it now! Let's go! Line up on the goal line. Come on, let's go. Let's go, on the hop. Sounds like he really likes the whole team. - Travis, how're you doing? Ashley? - Hey, Coach. How they looking? I don't know that we're gonna win a single game this year. Coach, you say that every year. Well, this year I mean it. You should let me play. Stop, I can keep up with these guys. Well, can you play corner, 'cause Mullins, he couldn't cover a one-legged receiver. But he can hit, coach, he can tackle, he's a mad man. Oh yeah, it's true. That boy, he can hit. Maybe he could play safety. Maybe Kenny'd play corner. He's pretty good at cover too. Huh. Huh. Bring it in, first team defense. We're going to try something. Thanks, son. You're welcome. Mullins, you're gonna move over to safety. Yes, safety! Smile any harder, your face will fall off. All she did was say, are there any cars coming, and I said I don't see anything my way. And I started to go! I did, I started to go! Oh, you won't be laughing when the insurance goes up. It's not my fault. You miss it? Driving? Keep it straight, no, no, little left, little left. Sorry, student driver. We'll work on that. Right, little right. Okay, go slow, hold it, hold, it's Duncan. - Where? - Twenty feet up here on the left. Oh, hey there, Mr. Duncan. I almost didn't see you. - Right, right, right. - Quick, take this wheel. Oh, that was great. Are you serious? Did you see his... no, you didn't see his face. Willard, I am a great believer in beginnings. Winners start strong. Seems to me like you need to switch things up a little bit. Try a new variety of plays. Well, thank you, Jasper, I'll certainly take that under consideration. Now, I've got some plays that I've been drawing up in my office. I'd like you to take a look at them. Corbin lost this game in the trenches. Their defense has played well, especially their secondary, but they've got to find a spot for their running game. Their line has got to dominate. Tonight they didn't. Riley was sacked four times. Hate to lose the first game of the season. Boy howdy, hate to lose the first one. - Can I get you anything? - Nah, no, nothing. Nothing, thanks, coach. Just one game, we'll get 'em next week. Offensive line isn't together. Defense played well. Yeah, yeah, they did. Switching Harris and Mullins, that was a great i.. You got a funny look in your eye. Willard. Not a good coach. Farris is not good for Corbin. Come in. Coach Willard Farris must go. Travis? How you doing, son? Hey, Coach! Making out all right? Classes, school all right? - Yeah, no, they're all right. - Good. - I'm a sit down. - Please. Yeah. How is the team doing? Umm, the guys are okay. They're glad two-a-days are done, I'll tell you that much. Two-a-days. Oh, that sounds great. Look, Travis, I wanted to talk to you about something. Travis, I'm thinking you should come back on the team. Oh... You mean like you want me to help out with equipment or something? That'd be fine. No, no, no, that's not exactly what I was thinking. What exactly were you thinking? I think you should play. - Play? Play what? - Football. I don't, I don't understand. Look, I've seen you the past two weeks watching practice. Travis, I never coached a boy loves football as much as you do. Its impossible, coach, I can't catch the ball. I can't see it. Well, that's right, of course you can't. - So you are going to have to play center. - Center? That's right, center, think about it. Think about it. Listen, all you got to do is, you're not going to have to pull block or anything like that. You got to snap the ball and you got to take out the nose tackle, who's just foot in front of you. He'll probably find you. Travis, all you've got to do... All right, stand up, come on. Stand up. - Okay. - Here you go. Square up now, put your hands up. Put your hands up, put them on me. Okay, and your feet, you want to spread your feet apart a little bit so you got some balance. When you move, you're going to move laterally, right? You're not a gazelle anymore, you're a pitbull. Okay. You just move with me, you keep your hands on me. If I go right, yeah. You've got to protect your quarterback. Yeah, move them feet, move them feet, put your hands on me. Keep them on me, understand? That's it, just keep coming, keep coming, and all the time I'm coming this way, that's how I want to... - How about that? - Ooh. You don't need your sight for that, now do you? - No, sir. - Well? You're serious? - All right, listen. - I don't know. You think about it. You take the weekend, you talk about it with your folks, and if you do decide that you want to give it try, I'll expect you on my football field, Monday afternoon. - All right? - Yeah. Coach? What if I can't? I'll see you Monday. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear. I want to welcome you all out this morning. So glad you all could be here. As I begin this morning, I want to ask everyone in here to close your eyes for a moment, everyone except for my friend here in the front row. You can keep your eyes open. Now, how would you respond if someone came in here and told you that what you see right now is what you're going to see for the rest of your life. How would you respond if someone told you that you'd never see the light of day again? Would you be angry? Would you be bitter? Who is that? Would you blame God and ask, why me? Or maybe beneath all of those questions, all of that emotion is simply fear. Fear of what your life might be? Who are you, ask yourself. Who are you? I'm Travis Freeman. Mom! Dad! I'm Travis Freeman! - You're what? - Oh, honey. I'm gonna play football! - Bring it in! - Let's go. Oh the hop. A player's gonna join the team. Where's he from? - Right here in Corbin. - Who is he? No way! Really? Yup. It's Travis. - How's that even possible? - What position? - Center. - No, no, no. Cameron, you're moving to guard. Kyle, you're our new short yardage fullback, congratulations. Cameron, you'll still be making the line calls, and you are going signal Travis where his man lines up. I think he deserves a chance. - Big day. - Yes. - Is Mary here? - She's over there. Well, at least she came. Excuse me. It's not a good idea. - Hello. - Hello. So you agreed to let him play? Agreed? It doesn't matter what I say. I'm just the mother. They can bash themselves senseless. It's not up to me. How's this even going to work? Don't worry about it. He ain't gonna play. - My dad took care of it. - What? How? I told him about it last night, and he called Mr. Duncan. All right. Let's go! Let's go! I want to see Special teams out on the field. On the hop, let's go! Travis, there's a problem. Blind? In the middle of all that mayhem. If something happened to him, I wouldn't be able to live with myself. Not to mention the school's liability. So, no. - Well, it's not your call! - You can't stop him from playing football! I can and I will. I'm the Athletic Director, and my word is gospel. - Gospel, huh? You sure about that? - Yes, I am. Travis Freeman will not play football. Okay, you all heard him. Oh, by the way, who's your lawyer? My... my... my what, my lawyer? In accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990, the state of Kentucky is bound to offer an equal opportunity to participate in any school sanctioned functions to any child with a disability. - Well, hang on a second. - I will alert your principal that your actions have put your school in direct conflict with the federal government, and advise him to expect the National Guard to shut and padlock the school doors in the morning. Now, hold on now. I'm not breaking any laws. We have regulations... I, look, it's, uh... If I were you, I'd clear my schedule for the next few months. You and your boss might be spending time in jail. Jail! You'll lock me... No, hang on. Every player needs this form. I looked it up, this form signed by his parents allowing him to play. - I signed that already! - Both. Both parents need to sign it. Now, I believe that Mrs. Freeman has the same doubts that I have. Isn't that true, Mrs. Freeman? - Oh, that was a bad move. - Excuse me? Larry... you got a pen? Well, you folks will excuse us. - Travis, coach, let's go. - Thank you, Larry. Come on, son. Let's go. East west. Come on, come on, come on, come on. National Guard? Padlocks? Maybe I exaggerated a bit. Trav! Set! Hut! You see? You see that? It's a distraction, that was the last thing these boys need. You gonna let it happen? I can't do nothing about it. She said it's against the law. She said it's some civil liberties or civil something, it's bad. All right, try it again. - Where? - Come back a little. - Here? - Yeah. Let's go. Down! Set! Hut! - Come on Freeman. - What? Hut! Hut! Hut! Get back in line, you'll get it. You'll get it. I mean, he can't really play, right? Good job, good job, good job. - There you go. - Put me in. - Really? - Yeah, put me in. Right here? Shoulder width. Yeah, yeah, I got you lined up. You're good. He is right in front of you, all right? Stay low. You want to play center? Well, get through me. - Put that in the paper. - I oughta take your head off. - Come on! - It can't happen in the game. You coward! You shut it too. That just cost you 20 laps. You too, Baker. Coach, you see they run every inch, or they'll do it again. - Yes, sir, coach. - All right let's go. He side-stepped you, man. Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's it, that's enough for today. You take it in, go on. Let's get two more in, let's go, let's go, let's go. Hey, coach. You don't think he's serious about Travis playing, do you? - That's what he said. - He's losing it. I can't wait to get to college ball. - No cripple-charity there. - Are you high? Ain't nobody giving you a damn scholarship. Just watch me, loser! They love me! - I got three schools fighting over me. - You're crazy. - Are you that dense? - What? You know coach. He says he's gonna do something, he does it. If Travis plays badly, the whole offensive line looks bad. - And if the line looks bad... - Wait a minute. Yeah, Travis better learned how to play center, or you can kiss that scholarship goodbye! What? Psst. Hey, mouse knuckle. - What, who is it? - It's me, fool! What? - Jerry? - Yeah. What are you doing, man? What time is it? Don't worry about it, get some clothes on. - Grab your cleats. We're meeting somebody. - Who? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Geez! - Easy, easy, easy. Mind telling me where you're taking me? Jerry! Oh my gosh, clean out your truck, this thing is nasty. - Ashley. - Hi. - You know what's going on? - No, not me, this is Jerry's idea. I ain't gonna have you looking like crap out there. You're better than that. You're going to get this center thing down, tonight. - Jerry... - Let's go! Is that moving? Oh my gosh, that's moving! - What's going on? - Whoa, whoa! - You guys are late. - Cameron? What are you doing here? I'm asking myself the same thing. Come on. Hey, no beer tonight. This is about him. It's always about him. Come on. Farris is putting you in a game, so I ain't going to let you make me look bad by stinking up in the field. Got it? Aw, I think he kind of likes you. Shut up, Baker! First, Travis, get in your stance. Wider, you got to have room between your legs for that snap. Come on! - Hey! - Whoa! What, are you going to teach him something, you washed-up 2nd stringer? All right. Now look, Travis, you got to use your feet. Your feet need to be wider apart than they normally used to. Feel your balance through your cleats. Get down. Now on the balls of your feet, you're moving forward. Good. Now dig in. Good, good, good. Not bad, not bad. Now try it with the ball. Here, there is the ball. No, he can't do that. You can't pick the ball up. It's all right, just try it again. Just roll it to find the laces. Sweep, good. Get your other hand ready to fire out. Dig in. - Yeah? - Let's try a snap. Here. You fart and I'll kill you. Hut. - Aw, damn! - You okay? Sorry, sorry. Aw, he's fine. Will you shake it off, 2nd string. You better cut the 2nd string crap. What are you going to do about it? Guys, hey, do I have to throw water on you all? Come on. Go on and try it again. Just gonna keep it slow, get the motion down first. Hut. Slow, you guys always have to rush things. No, stop, stop, I got it. All right. Here it is, try it again. Hey. Relax. Hut. One more time. Hut. Try it again. Hut. Hut. That a boy. Set. Hut! You know, I could have gone out, had coffee and come back in the time it took you to snap that ball. Do it again. Set. Hut! Keep doing it. Set. Hut! Down! Set. Hut! Travis. You know I don't need that. They don't know that. I am sure, Knox County is not expecting what they are getting. The Corbin Redhound is romping and stomping tonight. Get your hat on Freeman. Now or never, you're in. Kyle, I wanna see what you got at running back. Cameron you're moving to left guard, 32 power and left. Let's grind it out. Come on, get in there. - This is it, baby. - Go, Travis! Hey, don't screw up! Look, look, you see? I am telling you, Coach Farris is crazy! Someone is gonna get hurt! Down! Red 34, Red 34. Set. Hut! Gain of 11 yards, 1st down Redhounds. Not bad. Just like I taught you. In the first game of the season, Corbin ain't missed a lick, mowing down opponents. Slicker'n goose grease. Having Travis Freeman back on the team, that's the name of the game, all right. Corbin is playing inspired football. Ready! Set! You taking my job? Jerry? Jerry? What? - Where you been, man? - Here. You weren't at practice. Where were you? Don't need it. Don't play. - What did you say? - Nothing. Come on man, we're going to grab a bite at the depot. Nah, you go ahead, I'm good where I am. You drinking? Right out here? This ain't drinking. It's my after school job. I smell beer. I'm double checking the expiration dates. Are you trying to get kicked off the team? What team? Since fifth grade, it's always been about Travis Freeman. So go, go, big man. Mr. Everything. Ain't that what the paper used to call you? Why do you do this? You really have no idea, do you? - It's so easy for you. - Easy for me? I'm blind! Yeah, but, did that stop you? For one second? No! It didn't. You play, you get grades, you go to college. - Cut it out, Jerry. - You do it all. What am I missing? Huh? Why? I can't talk to you like this. Hey, you want to know why I drink? Because I like it. Hey Trav, hey Trav, where are you going? The Redhounds have run smack into a stubborn, ornery Wildcat team. And despite some uneven play, Corbin still has a chance to secure their place in the playoffs by putting together a fourth quarter touchdown drive to win this game. What's the problem, ref? Coach, we've got blood. He's got to sit out a play. - I'm fine! - You're my dang center. - I'm fine! - Let's go. There's no timeouts left. Freeman, get in there! Freeman! Hey! Sorry! Kyle! Hey! No, no, Kyle, get him. What are you doing, get out of here! Get off of me! Kyle, will you get him! There's some confusion on the field. That's right, yeah. Wildcats show blitz. Set. Hut! I told you this would happen! Blue camp recovers the football. Corbin is going to lose this game and fall to 5 and 2, and miss the chance to secure their place in the playoffs. Freddie? This is not good. Grab your bag. - No, who is it? - Stay down, Freddie, stay down, stay down. Was that my fault? - We are going to need stretcher. - Yes, sir. It's okay, it's okay. Hey. - Trav, you ready to go? - Yes sir. - Dad. - Yeah? Well, for Corbin, it comes down to the last game of the season. Win, and they are in the playoffs for the first time in ten years. Lose, and their season is over. Hey Coach, can you come in for a minute? - Can it wait? - I won't keep you long. - Hello, Karen. - Hey, Coach. - How's Freddie making out? - His leg's broke. He's in traction for the next couple of weeks. But he's still making jokes. You tell him I'll be by to see him again next week. I was just telling Karen and Mr. Marshall here how I tried to keep Travis Freeman from playing. Well, I think Travis has as much right to play as... He doesn't have any right to put those kids in danger! Freddie would be starting tonight if it wasn't for that boy! I'm afraid I agree. Now, I want your word you will not play that boy again. - Are we done here? - I want your word. Look, folks, I'm sorry about Freddie, but I don't blame Travis for it. It was a missed block, it happens all the time. You have a good game, because it's going to be your last. Well, that's not for you to say, is it, Mr. Marshall? But I'll tell you something. If it is my last game, win or lose, it's mine, not yours. And it's not yours neither, Jasper. So from now on just keep your plays to yourself and stay off my football field. Karen. We got through to him. What's... Whoa, ho, ho! Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo! - Jerry? - Shut up. You see what your doing? Go, kick butt, Trav, go. I will now. - Are we still talking? - Well, that depends. On what? Here, I want you to have this. What? What is it? It's that picture of us they took when we were kids in the end zone, - the one they put in the paper? - Why are you giving this to me? We signed it, man, we were going to sell it one day and... - Why, Jerry? - I owe you. - You owe me for what? - I'm starting. Do you think I let Freddie get hurt for you? - That's not what I... - You think coach wants to start you? You're the best quarterback I've ever seen, and he doesn't want to use you. He doesn't have a choice! Travis, you're not hearing me, okay? Jerry, coach wants to see you. Come on in. Close it, park yourself. I finally got through to your ma at the hospital. She has to work a double shift. Why should this game be any different? She said to wish you good luck. You know, she works hard. She keeps that place running, with all the doctors, nurses, and aides, they do just what she tells them to do. And she never has to raise her voice. I admire that. Coach... are you... Are you starting me just because you have to? Don't you know me by now? Hm? Go on, get ready to play. Yes, sir. Deep in the fourth quarter, and Corbin finds itself behind in this must-win game. Full trips right, 27 traps, go on. But the Redhounds are threatening. Watch 27. We need a win. We need to play some football now, all right. Right 27. Kentucky, Kentucky. Down. Ready, team! Set. Hut. - Right 4 right, 80, all stop. - Yes, sir. Corbin needs a touchdown. Three points and a tie doesn't get them in the playoffs. Come on, son, run the play. Black 18, black 18. Set. Hut! Drixon good for 7 yards. One timeout left, coach. Drixon is hobbling back to the huddle. He's had a big game tonight. Farris has been working him like his brother-in-law's mule. Farris is letting the clock run. He is not going to leave them Colonels any time, in case the Redhounds can score. Baker's got time. He's going for it all. Oh, sugar! Boy, I tell you this game's just making that tri-tip just... hmmm. The clock stops with 34 seconds - You okay, man? - I'm good. Corbin has just one timeout left. We're going bullets left, zip. 22 tackled trap, yeah? - Yes, sir. - Go on. Black 15, black 15. Set. Hut! He's down to the 15. Clock's running. Come on, move it, move it, move it. Farris lets Baker get his team back to the line. - You know it, do it, do it. - No huddle. Kentucky, Kentucky. Boy, Drixon's really limping now. - Split out left. - Kentucky. Down. Set. Hut! Draw, draw! Time! Timeout, timeout! And Corbin takes its last timeout. Give me a root beer and a sack of nuts. There's time for one last play! - This game! - Wow! You all right, man? You okay? Come on. Coach, he's done. All right, well, you take a seat, son. Offense! Bring it in. - Twins left, 48 sweep. - All right. Kyle, I am going to need you to run the ball. - Yes, sir. - Freeman, you got one last play in you? You kidding? We're going to run twins, left 48 sweep. - Kyle. - Yes, sir. Don't you take all day about it. You turn that corner and bully your way into that end zone. Take a look at the guys around you. Make sure when you walk off this field tonight, you've given your best. That you can hold your head up high. It's been an honor to coach you boys. Travis? Redhound pride on three! - One, two, three! - Redhound Pride! Go. You got this, Trav. All right, boys, here we go. Twins left. No, check that, let's run something else. Are you serious? Cameron, you're at center. Kyle, you are at guard. Travis, you're in the backfield. Wait, what? Jerry. You're not screwing this up! Run the damn play. Hey, there is no damn way in hell Kyle can score in a sweep. And you know that. But Travis can run 23 Blast in his sleep! But the handoff, man. Don't worry about it, I'll get you the ball. All you gotta do is run straight ahead. You can run a straight line, can't you? - Why are you doing this, man? - 'Cause I'm the quarterback. And you, you're Travis Freeman. Make a hole! Hit that linebacker like he's your old man. - Let's do it, boys. - Sweet. - 23 Blast on 1. Ready? - Break! Fasten your seatbelts, folks, this is roll up time. It's a full house back field, with Madden, Saunders and... Wait a minute, that's number 63. - Travis is in the backfield! - He's what? - What the hell?! - No, he didn't! Yeah, he did. Fingertips! Down! Black 22! You're gonna be fine. Black 22! - Feel your balance... - I think you should play. - In the middle... - Set! - Travis Freeman... - ...and myself... Relax. Whom shall I fear? Hut! It's gonna be close. What's the call? What's the call? The refs are digging in the pile. Touchdown! I knew it, I knew it, I told ya! Guess who's going to the playoffs! Corbin Redhounds, win! Son of a gun! Yes, yes, whoo! - Yeah! - Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Meet me at the top!
