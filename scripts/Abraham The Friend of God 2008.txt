But Jehovah gave me till the end of times. So, hear me man, son of Adam! With time still ticking, I will not be inactive. I will lead you into various temptations and sins. I will lead you into ignorance. Sweet ignorance! The great idol! Second only to Nimrod! Who are you? Sent by God! This a hallowed idol-house! Babel in the land of the Chaldeans was ruled by Nimrod. son of Cush. Babel in the land of the Chaldeans was ruled by Nimrod, son of Cush. Also known as Babylon, it was a small part of Nimrod's kingdom. Yet, it was the largest city I in the region. Nimrod was the most powerful man on earth. Fig was considered the god of gods. And his people worshipped him besides many other idols. People of Babel! I swear to you by Nimrod, the god of gods. I was dusting a certain idol. And even though my action was a form of worship. He cursed me with an eternal curse. Give way to Azar! Give way to the one who crafts the gods with his hands. Give way to the one who crafts the gods with his hands. May Azar put an end to this curse! Give way to Azar, please! He forms the gods with his hands. And by the generosity of this great sage the greatest priest of Babel one's fate is decided the clouds disperse and the sky of Babel brightens. When Azar uses his hands and tools, a god takes shape. And when a god is created, Nimrod, the great monarch, holds him dear in this land. I have not sculpted this cursed idol. Obeis, the other sculptor, did. You're a great poet. My carvers would make your god worthy of your words and that, without charging you. Out of the way! Bow down! Out of the way! Bow down! What are you looking at? That ungrateful Nimrod. He doesn't appreciate me. Me! Obeis! How can anyone holds Azar's idols worthier than mine? Sarai! What are Nimrod's troops going to do to him? What are you talking about? Abram didn't prostrate. What? They arrested him, father. Even though he's Azar's protege. What will become of him? What? The law is: prostrate or be punished. Lot, is it Abram again? He refuses to prostrate. What have you done, Abram? Do you enjoy being in this dark dungeon? Is it better than home? Should I prostrate before a man who's flesh and bone like me even though he's the head of an empire? That's enough, Abram! That bitter tongue of yours has disturbed Nimrod and his followers. Be careful! Soon, even I, Azar, won't be able to intervene on your behalf. Azar, why are you making my son son pt idols? I am,hunted by the ghost of Abram's deceased mother. I make Abram carve stones like my other children. Gut his father lets him stay here so he can learn the craft and knows well that his son sculpt with such great finesse. He's even superior to my own sons. Sculpt! Sculpt! For you shall be my successor! What have you done? - It's only rock... - It's a god to worship! This stone? How can you worship what you yourself make? You are my future, understand? You won't carve for me anymore. From now on you'll be selling. Selling only. You'll go to the bazaar and sell gods to your fellow Babylonians. Idols! Polished and colored! Cheap ones! Expensive ones! Neither useful, nor harmful! Buy an idol! Buy an idol! Cheap ones! Expensive ones! Get a good deal on my gods! They do no harm and they do no good. Buy now! Your own personal god made in Babel! I took you in, Abram. With love, I taught you everything. Everything! You should use what you were taught to grow the business. Not destroy it! Sculpt it again like this! sculpt again! Sculpt with inspiration, finesse and joy! Let your gifted hands turn hideous rocks into divine creation. Sculpt gods with your hands. Who created your hands and mine? I bought you from Azar with my money. So, I have power over you. I am your god. You must kneel before me. Kneel! You may be a god to the stupid Babylonians but you're not a god to me. Kneel! Kneel! Whose throne is that? The great Nimrod's throne! I only sit on that throne because of the peoples ignorance. But you, you are clever because you know to keen feeding their ignorance. As long as the people stay ignorant my throne is secure and I can rule them better than a god. But you are the god of Babel! You were freed at last. Captured Nimrod's cruelty Freed by Azar's intercession. Aren't you afraid? I might Nimrod's spy. Nimrod's spies are not as kind as you, Sarai. What do you know about Sarai's kindness? Nimrod's followers don't help the needy. Another Azar masterpiece! These hands create miracles! Elf Nimrod sees you. he'll forget his godship! Polish it! Lot, any news? He's gone again to the mountain to pray! Pray! Pray! Pray! Abram is my student, but he's nothing like me. I'll go look for him at the farm. Maybe he's returned. You're Nimrod's eyes. Harpak. You were supposed to cause Azar to be disfavoured not favoured! You also promised that Azar's idol would never reach the idol-house but it did and endeared Nimrod. My idol was supposed to charm Nimrod. It's very hard, Obeis. The day you were expelled from Nimrod's court Nimrod bestowed upon Azar the official commission to sculpt all the kingdom's approved gods. A commission I think is too heavy a burden for him. No, Harpak. Maybe, it'll help if I disclose to Nimrod our little secret. Then, it'll be really hard. Don't threaten me. Obeis! If need be, I'll bury you alive. Then, you'll be really finished. I did think of that possibility. That's why I revealed your secret to someone I trust. He's instructed to divulge everything to Nimrod in case you decide to kill me. Harpak. I will never forget that fateful day when I went to the forest. Fist I saw a horse. then you and then her... You win. Azar's idols won't enter the idol-house of Babel. Now go, Obeis. Don't stay here. That's good, Harpak. Good. Harpak. Obeis will reveal our secret to your husband the king if I don't get rid of his rival. Azar. Then, we'll kill both him and Nimrod. Lord Almighty! You've called me out from among my people! But my people don't worship you. They worship nothing! Listen! Oh, celestial bodies who are our gods! Oh, stars in the heavens. who hide in your bosom our future. 7 our lives, our riches, our empire, and our world. Our lives, our riches, our empire, and our world. Behold us', your servants! What are you worshipping? You are not wanted. Leave us be! Which star do you worship? Could it be Venus. the brightest in the heavens? But, I worship Jehovah, more luminescent than any star. What happened to Venus? It's not as bright anymore. It faded before the moon. So. now your new god is the moon. A much larger and brighter god for you. Why are you mocking us? Leave us be! Leave! Leave! I'm; the servant of the Most High! Faded. Their nighttime gods have faded. - During the day, they worship the sun, brighter than the moon. Leave! Leave! We worship what we please. Now that the sun has clone down. It is not worshiped at night. Worship Jehovah the true God who is Eternal Light! To be God is to be immortal and nothing in this creation is. Fie Lord is our heavenly father. Worship Him with all your heart. - What's he saying? - What new thing is that? I must invent a new god! Urgently! My people have gone astray, Lord! Satan has taken hold of their leader to keep them blind! Listen! I'm sacrificing my son to the gods To soothe their anger for my son broke one of the house idols. He was playing when his leg brushed against the idol and it broke. What kind of god is that who can't defend himself? That even a child can break him. I wonder if my new god is one of the broken halves Or is my child my new god? Lord, hear me out! I know without a doubt that you decide the fate of all. You rule! You decide! You're everything! You promised me wonderful things! Why don't you do one little thing for them? Open their eyes to see You, O Lord! Do you hear me? Do you hear me? He didn't hear you, Abram! But I can help you! Help me Lord not to hear him! Abram, it's I, the Lord. Soon, you'll marry Sarai. Then, you'll get out of your country, from your family. I'll lead you to a new land where I will begin a new thing with you. I will bless you and make you a great nation. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed. Because Abram. you are my chosen vessel. Damn you, Harpak! I will cause Nimrod's sword to fall on your head for this'! Men! I am the messenger of the one true God to you Babylonians. Abram, no. What are you doing? Have you gone mad? Do you want me to beg? I'm begging. Please. I'm begging. 'll even cry. But know this. prophet. My patience is running: thin. The feast of the gods is in 3 days. A day I've been eagerly waiting for. The feast of the gods is in 3 days. A day I've been eagerly waiting for. Not only for business, but or tradition. Please, don't ruin it. Azar! Those stones you call gods do they hear you when you call out to them? Stones do not hear. And octahedron can they help. Our fathers worshipped them. And we worship them too, even though you call them useless. I worship the Lord who created me and guides me out of His kindness. The same God who generously provides food when I hunger. Water when I thirst. And healing when I hurt. Aid when I die, he'll give me life again in the afterlife. As for forgiveness, he cleanses my unrighteousness. All because He's kind and forgiving. Leave me alone. Leave Babel if you can. Leave. Harpak has betrayed the king. That's a lie! That's a lie! That's a lie! This man is nothing but a deceitful liar. He's conspiring against you. Expel him once more. He's conspiring against you. Expel him once more. Take away this traitor! Not until I reveal the sordid details of how you betrayed the great monarch. That dreadful day when I saw the two of you in the forest. I swear by the king I'll kill you. Lock him up! Oh great Nimrod, kill me if you must at least, let me tell you what Harpak did to you. Let go of him! He's crazy. He's after revenge. Plus he wants to smear your reputation. All because you expelled him and chose Azar over him. On ghat dreadful day, your Maiesty. I was in the forest when I saw Harpak and your wife on lush bedding betraying her vows and your majesty. Your wife betrayed you, Majesty because you killed her father. She has been using Harpak's influence to topple your reign. She's guilty, Nimrod. Don't spare them! Don't spare them, Nimrod! Alright, Obeis! I heard you. Go! I said go! I won't play your game anymore. It's over! It's over! No, it's not. You will finish it. my dear Harpak. Obeis revealed our secret. If you don't keep your promise, I'll seduce Nimrod into killing you. Iii My Sword! Get lost! Was ell this to avenue your father and your tribe? Here's my sword! Go ahead! Kill me! Go ahead, kill me! No, Great Nimrod! Don't kill me! I can still be useful to you and Babel. You have always been prudent because of my advice. Killing me will serve no purpose except destabilizing your rule. Please, don't kill me! Please don't! Enough! I forgive you! And only because I can better use you now as my vizier. Thank you, Monarch! Get up! Get up! If I were you, I'd ged rid of Obeis! Are you with us? Today's the feast. Sarai will be there. I'm not feeling well. You go, Lot. But... Don't worry. There's a reason for it. Go on now! Do not be afraid. Abram. I am the Protector who protects and you Abram are my servant. I am the one and only true God who promises that I will make nations of you it and kings shall come from you. You're the great god in Babel after Nimrod. Who are you? Me? Destroyer of false gods! Your voice isn't frightening, though. I feel strange in your presence. I can't see well. my eyesight is dim. Why aren't you at the feast with the others? If you've brought offerings, please leave them and go. What? Not hungry? Prepare to defend yourselves! What makes you think I've broken the idols? There was only one person who didn't attend the feast with us. That's you! Abram! The favorite protege of Azar, the idol-maker. And there were witnesses. too. This axe belongs to Abram! Give me the axe! Whoever used this axe should be amputated. Even if he's my student or even my own family. I heard from Azar that the axe was found on the great idol's shoulder. Don't you think the great idol could have done it? Ask him and he may tell you he; didn't like the lesser gods. Everyone knows that these idols never talk and never move. You're right. You worship gods who can't talk and move. So, how can they move on your behalf and answer your prayers? And yet you forgot the One True God Jehovah whose Dower can deliver blessings and cursings. Fire on you and what you worship. So, it's true. You Abram are a prophet. I am. Enough! Harpak. Let it be known in all the kingdom the punishment that befits a heretic. Spare no firewood and let the flames reach the heavens and burn this man. Alive. Let it be done. It will be done, my king. All Babylonians must be present at the burning ceremony. everybody! Obeis, you win. You won this battle. I'll sell my workshop. You have no rival anymore. They're going to burn my dear Abram. My intercession is of no avail anymore. Nimrod regards me with disfavour. Now it's your turn to do as you wish. Yes, as you wish. Abram! Where's your saviour God to save you from this calamity? lam Abram. Servant of the one and true God. Instead of God, you worship nothing but useless, lifeless idols that you make with your own hands. Don't you realize that what you worship cannot provide you with sustenance? Leave for good these false gods! Seek sustenance from your Creator! And worship Him alone! Not the creature! Great Nimrod, the fire's ablaze. How do we get the heretic into the fire? Catapult him! Catapult him! No, wait! I too can bear being burnt. I too am a woman who worships. And many mothers I know do too. The gods who couldn't defend themselves against the axe are not gods at all. Me, Sarai... I worship the God of Abram. Burn me with him because I have an axe too. I will break the idol of Nimrod. - I will destroy his idols. - Sarai! Come Sarai! I am an Angel of the Lord sent to help you, Abram. Im also an Angel. Abram. Sent by God to protect you. Not one hair on you will be harmed! Blessed be the Lord my God who never fails to protect me. My God is the ruler of the universe. He is the uncreated Creator. Life and death are at His command. He is generous, kind and long-suffering. The One who makes alive and makes dead. He is the Alpha and the Omega. On the order of the Monarch prepare 2 prisoners sentenced to death! We'll go to the prison. This heretic must come too. Untie him! He's free. He's free. Untie him! Rao! Rao! Are you that Prophet from God... the one I couldn't see that day... and the one with divine protection? Abram! I renounce my idols for your God! Pray for my forgiveness! A lifetime of darkness... with just an instant in the light. Did you see? I gave life to one... and death to another. Cruel! My God is the Most High. Moon and sun obey His command. Every day He raises the sun from the east. If you can, tomorrow, raise the sun from the west. Stop it! Get out of Babel! It,doesn't want you. Leave it! You are the god of the earth. Fight the God of the heavens. He's not to go anywhere in Babel. We'll ascend the Tower of Babel and fight Abram's God. You are quite clever, Harpak. And you were right, too. I thought over what you said. I'm about to show everyone who here has absolute power. And that? why I'm on top of the Tower of Babel, the world's tallest. I'm going to kill Abram's God with my arrow. Your predecessor was also after my throne. As a young General, you got to him before I did. You succeeded him because youre smart and capable. But like him you went astray. Treason upon treason. If I forgive you... I won't be Nimrod anymore. My Monarch! Please forgive me! I am the absolute power. I don't need a vizier. It's tall. Very tall. I meant the tower. Flow should Harpak bid his Monarch farewell? Monarch, forgive me! Monarch, no. Forgive me! Monarch, forgive me! Monarch, no. Forgive me! Monarch! Forgive me! Someone, help! Azar. Abram! Abram's like my own son. Azar, believe. God loves those who repent. Tell your God, I'm your teacher and that I've loved you. - Tell Him to forgive me... - Join us and believe. I loved you, didn't I? Ask your God to forgive me. Go and tell your God to forgive me. Leave me alone. Help... Help... Help... Let go... No! Let go... No! Behold the fall of Babel's Monarch! Babel is breaking apart. Nimrod can't even fight a tiny mosquito. I must now look for a new god. Father knows that God has called you. He sent me. hike wants to see you. He sent loveliness. I'm not sure how to say this. But I'll try. I'm not sure how to say this. But I'll try. Am I a suitable husband for Sarai? I need a helpmate. Do you consent? I do. EL leave this land of idolatry and go to where the Omnipotent God will lead His servant. After settling in Canaan, Abram went to Egypt to wait out a famine. There, Pharaoh lusted for Sarai and the Lord plagued his house. After Pharaoh repented. he gave Sarai a maid named Hagar. Then, Abram settled in Hebron where he lived as a shepherd. Hi, Sarai. Abram. Something... ...is missing here. Something? Don't you hear its voice? What voice? The baby's. A baby's voice. I love you Sarai. Baby or not. Your seed is to bless nations. I can't conceive. I can't. I guess the promise won't come from me. Take my maid, Hagar. Abram's seed is more important than me. Remember, God's promise iis your right. I know without a doubt there's love between us. I am in love with you. Abram. Don't ask me that. I am asking. All I know is that God made me promises. And that nations would come from me. He promised. I'll talk to Hagar. Lot, you're here. I arrived last night. That Sodom is a wicked land. Men copulating with each other. I heard. God has ordained you in Sodom so that you may be a light and a prophet unto them. It's God's will. Sodom! Lot went back and became a thorn to the Sodomites. I asked Hagar. What happened? When Sarah and I left Nimrod's kingdom God promised us a son whose descendent would be a blessing and in whose name all will be called chosen. May the Lord bless my second born Isaac. My father Abraham is the son of Terah. Terah is the son of Nahor who is the son of Seruq who is the son of... Remember now son. Who is the son of... Reu who is the son of Peleg who is the son of Eber who is the son of Elah who is the son of Arphaxad who is the son of Shem who is the son of Noah. Well done, Ishmael. That's my jug. It's water for my love. My love doesn't need your help. We don't need a maid. I don't need a maid. You should prepare to leave. I Sarah am my husband's only wife. Are you disappointed with our son? You don't love us anymore. Are 'cu disappointed with our son? You don't love us anymore. You must resist this temptation. Do not surrender to it. Love is why I'm here with you. And our son is God's promise. Sarah, beware jealousy's fire. It burns worse than Nimrod's flames. Fight it. Throw them out. Hagar is my responsibility too. Ishmael is my son. Sorry, Sarah. I can't do that. Oh Lord! This situation is taking a toll on me. Give me your wisdom. I will make a nation of Ishmael. But, hearken onto Sarah. For out of Isaac your seed shall be called. Do not fear for the lad and the bondwoman. I will keep them both safe from any harm. It's time to bid farewell. It's God's will that you stay here and I go back. What have we done to deserve this? Here's called Safa. That hill's called Marwah. God showed me this place in a dream. We'll die in this desert. Have mercy on us, my lord. It's really hot here. Oh Lord, keep them safe as you promised. Have obeyed every command of yours no matter where lam. Oh Lord, help them find favor and provide for their needs. And cause them to be grateful for your blessings. Abraham! Abraham! Abraham! I'm here. I'm here. You're here Lord. Nearer than near. More than ever. Oh Kindness, Divine Kindness! Your son... Isaac. I love him so much. Your son! He's all grown up now. And dearer to me than life. Go to where I will show you and prepare Isaac to be sacrificed. This is not true. Do you want me to sacrifice my precious son like the Canaanites who throw their firstborns into the fire for their idols? How can you ask me such a thing? If everyone kills their offspring, how would the earth be blessed? No, no, no. I don't believe it. I'll go find our son, Sarah. For we must worship. The camel is ready by the gate. I'll be waiting, sir. Tomorrow we sacrifice to our Lord. I'll prepare the best sheen in the herd. I'll prepare the best sheen in the herd. God will provide Himself the sacrifice. He will. Your mother greets you, my son. We leave in the morning. What do you know of revelations, son? Divine ones? Both when I was asleep and awake God clearly showed me what to do. Sacrifice a lamb for God? You are the lamb to be sacrificed. God ordered me to sacrifice you. If it's God's will. you'll find me willing. Father... do what you've been ordered to do. Father, tie the rope tight and do it quick. A sharp dagger is an easy death. Send peace to mother. Tell her I willingly accepted my fate. Father, be proud. God is satisfied with you. It's hard what you've asked me to do. Lord. Give me strength. I was busy at times and didn't enjoy all the days of your youth. Flow, I won't see you in your old age. Worse, you must die by me. It's on God's command. son. I always do what He commands. You understand. son? Lay me prone. That way you won't have to see my face. Be strong, father. Oh, Lord! I'm sending my son back to you. Hp is all Yours, my Lord! In the name of the One True God! Abraham! Let go of Isaac. Flow, I know that you fear God since you have not withheld your son your only son from Me. Now, I really know. Today. I have provided on this Mount an acceptable sacrifice. And because you did this, in your seed I will bless all the nations of the earth.
