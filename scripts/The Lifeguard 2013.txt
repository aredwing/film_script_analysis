They're yours, so you get attached. It's not offbeat. It's news, and if you put it in offbeat, it makes it... it makes it sound like a joke. This is a really good story, Raj. Look, relax, Leigh. Hey! Thank you. We're very happy. She was very happy. Well, about time I manned up, right? To the tiger. May the road rise. May the tiger... don't say anything about the tiger.

I wanna move back in with you guys. Honey, you're 30 years old. I'm 29. I'm 29. And 10 months. I've never, you know, asked for... I just need some time out of my life. Well, we all do. Are you all right, Leigh? Yeah. I just don't want to turn 30... And still be in that life anymore. Well, what's wrong with the life you have in the city? It's not... it's not good. I mean, I'm not... I'm not happy. You're depressed? Is that it? Are you depressed? No. Not c... clinically. My life hasn't turned out like I pictured. Well... well. It's just nice to have you here. Okay? If you're gonna stay here, you have to contribute. To what? Okay. Of course. I would... I would say you both have a very keen eye... Because this painting represents... A very small percentage of what he produced. And this is a happier piece... um, this is one of the happier pieces. Um, but there's a... if I'm gone for 30 minutes, nobody notices. Nobody even cares. This is your ideal job. How long are you here for? I think a while. Like... A while. Why? I'm getting back to basics. What about your job? Yeah. No. What about your boss? He... um, that guy's engaged. Leigh-Leigh. Why are you just standing here? I need you to cancel your plans with anyone else ever. Okay. Have you seen Mel? No. Why? You should probably see Mel. I'm home! No. You guys can talk. Sorry. I'm gonna... I'm here, but I'm... I'll close... Get Back To The Island Get Back To The Rain Get Back To The Start So We Can Do It Again Snuffed By The Sunshine Covered In Gray Get Back To The Sun So we can feel it again I saw Todd. I know. I can't... thirty, still in the closet. Seriously? It's like... hey, do you still smoke? I'm not supposed to. What, are they bad for you? Um... well... No, we're trying to get pregnant. Like, with a human baby? Mm-hmm. But it's been about six months, and there's just... Nothing happening. It'll happen. It'll happen. So you don't... no. Yes. Yes. I will. All right. Don't tell John. Okay. Oh, shit. Can anyone see me, do you think? Mmm. Maybe. Well, then we should go. Wow. Teen mom. Place Me In the shadow of your love Like An Alley Cat Aroused I Believe We've Had Enough Hey, Hey, Hey Place Me In the shadow of your love I have a plan. - You have a plan? - a good plan. I'm gonna lifeguard. What? - She was a lifeguard in high school. - and college. - Where? - fox crest condo complex. It's really good money. It's good money? How much? Wait. Can I... hold on. I'm sorry. Can I just say, what the hell are you talking about? You realize that minimum wage is 8.25 now, so that's... that's not exactly... You're not going to have your high school job. You have a college degree, and you're 30. I'm 29. Todd, I'm 29. That's a fact. Hey, hey, hey. Todd, can I have... thank you. Can you please not do that? Come on. It's one drag, John. Fine. Okay? I got a question for you, Leigh. You think these guys are gigantic losers... Because they've never left ridgefield? I mean, I don't think that. I'm just asking, you know... - that's a really judgmental question. - yeah. Well, Leigh's cosmopolitan now, and she understands this kind of thing. - What do you think? - definitely. Absolutely. - See? - honestly, I do. It's a sweet job. You do nothing. You do nothing. But in my field of expertise. Do you remember that red one-piece bathing suit she used to wear? - She looked like a swiss army knife. - you guys could come visit! - Are you having a nervous breakdown, Leigh? - John. - What? - what? I'm kidding. Jesus. Is this parking lot passed down in the DN.A. Of skaters? Like a geese migratory path? - Look at us. - that's true. John. Yes? You don't know this, but... This parking lot, this very place... it was like the beating heart of our high school social life. This was it. We used to come here every night. Then we'd try and think of what we were gonna do that night. But really we would just end up standing around the parking lot. Oh, yeah? Like making out and stuff? - More than that. - - I'm sure. I'm pretty sure I opened the back hatch of someone's... No, no, no, no, no. of someone's... I'm sorry that I brought it up. Who was it in the back? - Come on, please. - stop it. Can you not... stop it. Well, despite our elderliness, some things remain from our youth. No. I get up so early. It's torture. Me too. I have to go. I'm asleep right now. Good night. Just... no, don't go. Shit. I'm coming. I'm coming. It's probably the same shit as before. I wasn't here in 2000, so I don't know. You've gotta log the pressure in these tanks every day. They drop below 10 or above 30, you gotta let me know. I remember. The ritual. I usually cut the grass about once a week, every 10 days. When it gets really high, I try to keep it out of the pool. You got the hook over there. Got new chairs. All right then. Here are the keys. I'm usually around unless I'm not. Don't skimp on the cleaning. I will not. Okay. Hello. Hi. Hey. I'm Little Jason. My dad's Big Jason, head of maintenance. Leigh. New lifeguard. Yep. I... I live right there. Apartment in the garage. Oh. Oh. Yeah. See ya. Hey. Hi. No running. Hey! No running! What are you doing in here? Stop! Oh, my god! Stop it! Fuck you, you fucking bitch! Suck my dick. Excuse me? You need to leave the pool, now. Get out. - No, bitch. Suck it. - get out! Out! Out! Right now! Get out! No running! Fuck you! You're fucking ugly! Get out, now! Leigh. Small Jason. How you doin'? Fine. Can I have a cigarette? Do you know the kids who live here? Some of 'em. Do you know one who's about 10... But he looks like a 1930s italian gangster... Except shrunk into a miniature, and he's really obnoxious like he has no mother? Aaron. He has a mom. She's fat... to, like, the point of not moving. Why? He can't come to the pool anymore. He's banned. Why? Because he wouldn't listen, and he and his friends swore at me, and they wouldn't listen. And I'm not... I'm not invisible. I'm the fuckin' lifeguard, motherfucker. And some cunt just sat over there in her chair, flipping through her magazine like I didn't even need her help. Oh, shit. Whoa. Well, she was. I'm not a babysitter. I'm not here to be screamed at. You gonna quit? I don't want to. I really don't, but... thought you were supposed to be healthy, lifeguard. I'm just supposed to make sure you don't die. You're talking about middle schoolers? There were four of them. Leigh, were they standing on each other's shoulders, or how did this... I told Mel we'd pick her up later. Do we have reservations? For what? Let's just, you know, do whatever. You don't even have to come. Really. It might not even be fun for you. If you don't want me to come, just say so, okay? Maybe stay home? Is that okay? I just want to get it out of her... you know, what she's doing. And then I'll come home and tell you everything. Yeah. I really don't care. You don't... Care? You can't drink though. One glass of red wine is... Fine. Honestly. How else would french women get pregnant? Oh, okay. Yeah. Whatever, Mel. Asshole. Hey. Mmm. Jesus. Hi. So... lifeguard. Yeah? Can you buy us beer? Please? Yeah. Lumpy's brother was supposed to, but circumstances intervened. No. Why? I mean, because we have lives... That don't need to be interrupted by the long arm of the law. What would we get out of it? I don't know. I think you do. What is valuable to someone looking to broaden his mind? Something you could perhaps purchase. It grows in nature. Oh. A moment, please, while we conference. What about Mel? I don't know, lifeguard. What about Mel? No. No, no, no. Excuse me. You didn't say anything about getting weed from my 16-year-old students. They look older. Yeah. No. We should go then. Hey. No. No. If you're so worried, then don't do it. Oh, that's so much fun. I'm so glad that I left my car at home. Then do it. They'll think you're awesome. Keep your voice down. No. This is not... I could get fired. 'Sup? Vice principal smith-lentz. Hi, boys. Um... all right. Let's talk about this, because this is potentially... Very confusing, I think, for everyone. I came here with these people not knowing what they were intending to do... Or with whom... Or... What. I don't care if you smoke weed with us... Because I'm droppin' out. Yeah, me too. Yeah, I don't give a shit. Are you insane? Do... do you actually want to face this cold, harsh world... Without a high school diploma? Why don't you just blind yourself while you're at it? No. I hate it here. We're moving to Vermont. Vermont? yeah. I definitely am. My sister's up there. Yeah, my mom's there with my stepdad, like an hour away. It's way better than here. You heard what they said. They're not your students, so... shall we? Todd? Great. No. This is wrong. To you, it is, Mel. Not to the rest of us. Oh, wow. This is... now you see what I have to put up with. Mm-hmm. But... I... hey. Hey. No, I do not approve of this! You went to RH.S. Too? Yeah. Um, Leigh was actually valedictorian. What were you? Um, I... well... leonard, it actually took me until after high school... To really focus. Really? Oh, yeah. Do not share this location with anyone unworthy. Does the old lady have, like, a fuckin' shotgun for trespassers? She doesn't have a shotgun. But if I find out any of your friends came here... And desecrated a tiger lily... Or littered, I will have a shotgun. That's cool. What? Don't be an idiot. Just... I wish I could impress that upon you. Okay. I know you think this town is bad... And, you know, you need to leave, but I don't think you realize how privileged this experience is. How's it privileged? Nature, for one. Excellent public school education, for two. It's safe. You're sheltered... which you never will be again. Well, me and him get arrested one more time, we're tried as adults. My classes suck, so... well, stop doing dumb shit, "a." And "b," Your classes don't suck. I'm in special ed. I have AD.D., so... what? Having AD.D. Does not mean you should be in special ed. Thanks. I know. Orion's belt. Big dipper. Mmm... Seven sisters. You're 16. You have your whole life ahead of you. You have no idea how lucky you are right now. Thank you for driving. That was... Probably unfortunate. Fuck you guys. - What? - I really needed to have fun tonight. And you didn't even care. And you don't even... you never ask how I am or... Mel, what's... what's wrong? It's just really hard, trying to get pregnant. I... I think that's normal, right? Isn't your life perfect? No! Oh! Hey. Hey. I read somewhere they did a study of children in jamaica... Whose mothers smoked weed during utero, and they were actually happier and more creative than other children. I believe that. Absolutely. Absolutely. Mm-hmm. "Remember to not be too nostalgic for this time. Our lives are what lay ahead... In this uncharted territory of our dreams. Aw. Be brave and bold... And do not look back, classmates, for the future is meant to be seized... With both hands." Both hands. Oh. So embarrassing. Both hands. Both hands. Really? It's that funny? Yeah. Leigh London, valedictorian... And virgin? - Yes. See? - What did I know? Absolutely nothing. Mm-hmm. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hi. Right. I don't want to drive. Tell him you're too tired. I'm very tired. I'm tired! Because I've had a long week. No. John, I'm just tired. Okay. All right. See you tomorrow. Hey. I love you. I'm sleeping over. Yes! I will prepare us cereal. I'm so jealous of you. Me? Why? Because you get to be lost. It's okay. Hey. I thought you lived in fox crest. Yeah. And you were too fucked up to walk the 20 yards back to your bed? My mom kicked me out. Because you were fucked up. I'm gonna go puke. Here. Better be careful, man. You pass out like that in Vermont, you froze in the snow. Ah, the myth of Vermont. Myth? Shee-at. It's on the map. Next week. Well, that's just not gonna happen, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I know. But that's why I'm trying to have a conversation with you about cap rates. Right. Exactly. Yes. Well, that's why I hired you. Don't be an asshole about it. No, we don't trust bankers. We do not trust bankers. Okay? We got this guy. When he starts to push back, that's what you do. It's sort of like... right. Yeah. This is a, uh... this is a chuck e. Cheese we're talking about. Obviously, don't use that language... but you know what I mean. Let Me Take You To the outside place Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Let Me Take You To the outside place Oww! - Oh, Do You Wanna Go - again! Again! Again! To The Place Where you belong? - Oh, Do You Wanna G - oww! To The Place Where you belong? Do You Wanna Go? Most people get better with age with driving. He's actually gotten worse. I don't think that's... no, because you started out as a fairly good driver. It was intentional bad driving. Was it? It was intentional? Yes. Leigh? Give me a m... number one, you got a nice community here. Number two, you have no respect for... hey. Leigh London. How you doin'? Hi, rick. How are ya? Listen, I know these guys. Can I help at all in this situation? No. This is police business. - They're skating. - and someone complained? Or... is there an ordinance against it? I didn't think there was. Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to go away now. Unless you have a valid reason to be cornering these underage youths, what you're doing right now is called harassment. Maybe I should take you downtown for impeding an arrest. Am I impeding an arrest? If you have a reason to arrest them and you can prove it, then, I mean, by all means take me down, 'cause I... I will understand. No more skating. But why, rick? You're a real piece of work. You're kind of a bitch, actually. I'm sorry. What was that, Officer? You know I'm a reporter for the associated press, right? Fuckin' nuts. So you're just gonna take some time off and then, uh... I mean, what, are you thinking of a career change, or, uh... Uh, I don't know. Okay, well, are you gonna look for something else around here? Or were you gonna go back to the city once the pool closes? - I have no idea. - okay. That's... Good. Good. Ah, no. No, thanks. I will pass on that. Uh, Leigh, evidently, will not. Can you just keep... Drinking your beer? Yeah. Let's try and have fun. I know that it's weird, whatever. But... Let's just try and have a good time. Okay. I can't believe it's not developed yet. It's a park, John. Nature. It's "pra-served." We used to come when we were little. Remember Leigh had all these plans about getting married under the arbor? I'm thinking it's water table issues. Otherwise the city would've developed the shit out of this place by now. What does this remind me of, Mel? It's like, uh, great expectations. Right? Remember that? It's all overgrown and old and everything. No way. This is a piece of chandelier. This is a crystal. It's original. I just found it. Bullshit. That's probably a hypodermic needle. Let me see it. No! 'Cause better classes now at, you know, a better college. I don't wanna go to college. Okay. What do you want? I don't know. Something cool. Something... Outside. Wh-what does that mea... You have to be specific. You can't just drift. What? You seem really sad. Well, it's just Leigh never seemed like the kind of person that would be lost. You know? Me, on the other hand... yeah, well, you know, real life can be disappointing... When your expectations are so high. I have high expectations. You know what I'm talking about. Everybody does. Well, whatever. Excuse me. I'm not gonna hang out with those kids anymore. Okay? Why not? We didn't smoke weed. Seriously, Mel? I mean... Leigh is being a fucking idiot. Okay? I mean, Todd wants to, like, rape those kids. Hey. Hey. You can't say that. Look, I just wanna hang out with adults. Okay? Is that too much to ask? Great. "Great"? Fine! Fine. It's fine. What are you doing? Slap my face... With your dick. Wh... what's wrong with you? Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, baby. Hey. I love you. Okay? I love you. Hey. It's okay. I did a story about a guy who kept a tiger in his apartment... In the city. The tiger got sick and died. Well, that'd be cool. Right? To have a tiger as a pet. And fuckin' invite everybody you hate to the house. What? What? It's not cool. It's sad. It's incredibly sad. This creature was kept... Against its will... In a totally unnatural environment for it. And it was kept in, like, a cell... In someone's apartment... For their amusement. But it was cruel, and it killed it. Someone took this amazing thing that... that should have been running free... And kept it prisoner. And it died. And it was just... it wasn't even full grown. Well, maybe, 'cause you wrote the article, you know... um, I-if somebody had an animal... And they weren't treating it right, they would read your article and... and... Change their minds. Yeah. Maybe. Oh. Ohh! Lifeguard? Please don't ban me from the pool. You didn't listen. You were behaving in a way that was dangerous to everyone. Please! I'm sorry! You disobey lifeguard's orders again, and that's it... you're out for good. But you can come back. Yes. Well, um, lifeguard? Can you tell Little Jason and those guys to leave me alone? 'Cause I said sorry to you now. Okay. What the fuck! You fucking scared me. It's raining. So? I recognized your car. I should lock my doors. No. Where are your no-good friends? I don't know. Where are your no-good friends? I don't know. I'm... Gonna... what? Um... You didn't bring an umbrella? I didn't know this would happen! Hey. Forgot your keys. Thanks. What's up? What's goin' on, man? There we go. I Was Cut Open On The Way Down Reelin' From The Blow And You Were There On The Other Land In Between The Tears And the light show What's gonna happen? You're asking me? Um... everything's gonna be fine. Life has great things in st... But All This Talkin' It's Drivin' Me Insane And I Was Told If I Was To Sing Along Forget About Myself We're All The Same Yes. Take it down. Well, Maybe I Should Chae My point of view Dizzy In The Morning And I'm Shakin' In the afternoon There's Never No Warning When It's Gonna Hit And I'm Lie An earthquak When I Get To Thinki' Too much Everything's Fallin' And shakin' and fallin Through My Hands Well, Maybe I Should Chae My point of view Leigh, what is wrong with you? What? Nothing. Doesn't mean you can take advantage of your father and I and pretend this is a hotel. You came in at 3:00 in the morning. I was worried. I didn't know where you were. Sorry. I lost track of time. Just do a couple of dishes once in a while. Pick up after yourself. Huh? Your father's out. I need to get out of here too. You need a ride to work, you got to get going now. I don't... I don't need a ride. I'm not working till the afternoon. Good morning. Hans, what are you doing here? Leigh's got the morning off, so I thought we'd make granola bars like the old days. Yes! Please tell me this isn't happening. You're supposed to be in hartford. What? Picking up my banners for the trade show. You told me that you would do it... Because today I have to do the yoga workshop, Hans. I'm so sorry, justine. I forgot. Shoot. I saw Leigh's schedule on the fridge, so I thought this would be a good morning for us to do this. Oh, and you didn't happen to see the directions... That are right there to the printer? No. What kind of a trade show is it? It's a health and fitness trade show... To get out the word on dance mamas. Uh... I'm sorry. It's just the name, mom. It's... it's just the name. Justine, I'm sorry. I forgot, okay? Sweetie? Justine. - Shoot. - yikes. We got all morning. Sorry. I... I'm s... sorry. In the summers, when I was really little, we'd go up to my mom's friend's, up in Vermont. He had, like, a... Cabin. So small, on a lake. You'd have to shower in the lake. We'd catch sunfish. And, you know, they were just... people usually throw 'em back. But we'd cook 'em on the fire. They were the best. You can bite. Be careful. We don't want you getting hurt. I Was Out Paying close attention Or Was I Lost Inside my thoughts These Days It's hard to tel What's Outside From what's in my mind Oh, God, It's Beautiful Insatiable The Way Our chemicals collid Slower. I Was Out Catching up to tomorrow Or Was I Caught Up In the past?

Gotta get a move on. Soon when? Few days. Do you actually have money saved? I have, like, 400 from helping my dad around here. Jay, you need at least a thousand. At least. You don't know how long it's gonna take you to get work up there. Why don't you just take a few more weeks... And work hard with your dad... And... Just hang out? I Was Sleeping In the lilies Or Was I Up All Night? These Days It's hard to tell What's Half Asleep From fully alive We Were Loving Like a landslide Or Were We In A Fight?

I am merely spending time. I am merely sucking up his youth like a vampire. When are you leaving? Okay. A week. Excuse me. They're leaving in a week? What? It's time. If you want a change, then, uh, try picking up a hobby. Yeah. Guys, I... I really... I wanna talk about this. I think we can even bring guidance in to... no. No. No. I'm not staying in this fucking town with these asshole people. Okay? There's, like, a world out there outside of this town. The world is full of assholes. At least we're the assholes that you know. You need a drink? Let's get you a drink. I'll come. Oh. Do you have a lighter? Thanks. Are you okay? No. I hate it here. I hate my life. I did too. I did too. But, like, why don't you leave, man? I mean, like, you actually could, like, go to New York city. 'Cause I can't. And my parents are here, you know. Family, friends. People know me. Once I leave, everything... Would be very, very different. You know how my brother died? Oh, yeah. Yeah, we were seniors. I remember really well. Like... he was a fuckup. I mean, he was such a fuckup. But... I don't know. And, like, he died, and my mom can't even stand the sight of me. Like, for real. I see it on her face every time I walk in the room. So...

They want to do it themselves. It's like a... Midlife thing, like a... "Do something with my hands" thing. Yeah? Well, they didn't. I know. I know. It's so embarrassing. It's like... how hard is it... To just move forward and... Leigh. Just wanted to make sure you weren't the raccoons. Oh, no. Are you still up because of me? We started that addition when you went off to college. You know, I made your dad do it. I made him go to home depot. I made him do the plans with me... So we would have... Something together. You know how that worked out. But it's not funny, Leigh. And it's not yours... it's not yours to be embarrassed about. I... I need you to move out. Now. Are you serious? Mom, I'm sorry that I was snarky about the addition... has it ever occurred to you... That I might be working on my life? Hmm? We both can't be doing that at the same time? Oh, is that what you're doing? Yes. You know, I'm al... I'm allowed to, um, be confused... And stumble once in a while. Okay? I've never done that up until this point. Okay? Never. Let me tell you something. I've always been 100%... your father would be so happy... To keep you as a baby forever. But it's different for the mother. Now, I know you don't know what that means yet, but... you know that you were the solar eclipse of my life? That's what I wanted. I hung on your every breath... Until... well, until recently, and I... I just can't... I'm not... I can't go back in time with you. I'm not asking you to. You have to go. No, no, no.
