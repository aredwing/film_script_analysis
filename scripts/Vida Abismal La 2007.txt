At 18, l was a complete dis with no perspective on life, a rebel without a cause, a nervous wreck, confused, disoriented, who hardly knew what he wanted. The only thing that moved me came from the depths of the most evident immorality of the time and l defied the most rational social requirements, ceaselessly destroying them to disguise an uncalled for fear, that was paralyzing me. You're going out now? You hardly sleep, son. One of my favorite vices was gambling. lt still is, but with nuances. l don't think l'm addicted, but it fascinates me. One is in the game what one is in life, an extension of your doubts, of your bravery, of the personal traits that characterize you. -l'll see them. -l pass. A pair of kings and a knight. You win. lt's in gambling that l have unsolved problems, for fascination and fear, like a unforgettable trauma, a mental wound acquired in 1972, in an exceptional card game. Chino. Tan. Ferran. Juanito the Moor. -Good evening. -Good evening. There are 9,000 pesetas. l'll see it. Everything or part? l said that l'll see it. Bad luck, man. l don't have a cent more. How will we get the money back? Does anyone have 9,000? -This game is a joke. -Ajoke? Wouldn't you do the same? You all would have cheated. Then the game must be suspended. -That's no excuse. -For you, either. Do you have dough? -Do you want cards? -l see the total with yours. -Without seeing them? -Without seeing them. lf you loose, they get 36,000. Are you up for it? lf none of you wants to win, l'll do it. You're nuts. -Show the fucking cards. -Listen... You listen to me. lf l loose, there'll be 36,000 on the table. l'll play this with the other's cards. First, prove you have the money. After playing with mine, you won't have another chance. lf you accept, go ahead. As you see, l can cover that. l accept the bet and conditions. Play the card. Moor... And yours? You've won. -How do you want to be paid? -However you can. Here. The debt l owe you. Come here. Let's go to Valncia for a drink. l'll bring you back to the village. l don't like that game. Too much luck involved. Poker and 54 leave more room for creativity. l won't play again anytime soon. You lost because of fear. Fear or not, cards are the same. You're wrong. -You like boxing? -Yeh. l'm not a big fan, but l like Cassius Clay. The Greatest. Know why? 'Cause he wins before he gets in the ring. He psyches out his opponent. Before the fight, he uses scare tactics in the media. And? His rival is terrified, unconsciously recognizing Clay's superiority. What's your point? lf the others know you're going for broke, they'll play to you to win. -So later you'll lose more. -That's your problem. Pessimism. You think you'll lose. Cards call for cards, and money calls for money. And lost calls for lost. And l lost. -Maybe l started a bad streak. -So change it. -How? -Take risks. lt's outside of my budget. With that mentality you'll always be poor. Of course l was scared. There were 9,000 pesetas on the table and l lost them. With women and cards, fear paralyzes you. -l'll pay you little by little. -Relax, no rush. But a gambler always pays. lt's a question of honor. -Are you a gambler? -l am. lf l forgave you, it would hurt your pride. Correct. How do you make a living? However l can. Cleaning ditches. l suspect you'll never be rich. And what do you do? l gamble. l gamble at night, afternoon, morning. l gamble all day. What do you think? Nothing. lt's your life. My life... my life's a mistake from the beginning. Do you want to come, kid? The kid is ruined. Let's go? Tough guy! Rosa, my princess. She's from Jan. Not a princess at all. This is Ferran. Let's go? Wait, l'll get my stuff. What do you think? Beautiful. And also smart. We'll meet in 3 days, at the caf. Good. Good morning. You'll always be a no-body. Good night. Your behaviour will kill your father. l befriended Chino inevitably. We met with the excuse of paying the debt, but we hardly ever talked about it. Have this, for now. He became my idol, my protector, the father l missed. His life appealed to me, breaking the rules, living on the edge, accepting risk as natural, playing it all on one card. Not a word. When you lose, you don't bat an eyelash. Defeat excites me. But success... What interests most bores me, tires me. -What do you mean? -You'll see. l am adopting you. You'll be my lucky charm. Hey! The charm! Rum and coke and a gin and tonic. Make it a stiff one. -Hello, Father. -Hello. How infrequently you come to church. Lots of work, Father Manuel. -Bring me a coffee. -Right away. Watch the rat. lf only you knew... But he's the worst son of a bitch. lt's weird people in the village. One Sunday, at mass, he accused by name ''all of the rich youngsters who frequent prostitutes in Valencia''. The list was incomplete. He forgot to name a friend of his who went to see hookers. Every club protects their own. -Why is the Moor such an ass-kisser? -He needs to be. Does he? He has a business, he's a friend of yours. Despite many years here, some still criticize him. -Why? -Why? Because he's a Moor. Save this for me in the fridge. l'll get it tomorrow. lt's my birthday. -Goodbye, Juan. -Bye, Father Manuel. Goodbye, son. -Juan, l'll pay you tomorrow. -You are invited. Damn! l don't like sweats. Juan's in a fix. -He already had problems. -This is all he needed. Now he won't have to kiss ass. He'll drop this vice. Should we throw it? Hi. Good afternoon, Juan. A coffee. Happy birthday, Father Manuel. You look 20. Clean living, Juan. Take note. Can you give me the cake? Right away. Where is it? l'm sure l put it here. Look hard. Two? -Juan, what about the cake? -lt's disappeared. Disappeared? Stolen. lt's been stolen. This is scandalous. l swear to God it wasn't me, Father. This is absolutely immoral. l'm innocent, Father Manuel. l swear, l'm innocent. l'm innocent. Father Manuel... l don't understand. ljust don't get it. -lt's not fair, Juan. -l'm sure l put it here! Actually, we saw it. lf l knew who it's been, l'd kill them. For a cake? After meeting him, my life took a radical turn and my relationship with my parents got worse. For me, the family haven changed into some sort of center for the destitute. l ate and slept, but nothing else. You owe me and have to pay up. l'm having some financial difficulties. -l need money. -Take it easy. l'll get on the ball. -We'll send a bill to a fake company. -We'll swindle the bank. Good idea. -You will be the other company. -Me? But l don't have a cent! This is very delicate. lf you don't pay, l'll have to. How? -l always pay. -The game could go bad. l always win. We won't ask for too much money. Two or three and we fold the business. -What kind of business? -Furniture. -Classic or modern? -Whatever you like. We need a locale. -How about your place? -What! My house!? ln the Business Register they don't know if it's residential or commercial. Anyhow, we'll fold soon. You'll swindle the bank three times. -ln one week. -No. -The bank won't suspect? -No. We'll work with 3 different banks. ln 90 days the company will disappear. That's all. The caf's address would be better. That address is already a business. Ok, it will only last for 90 days. Vicent, bring a little more wine. Every hand was a grand finale for me. Each reckless play, l thought of the bank like an enormous steel ball hanging above my head. lf before l enjoyed seeing how he played, now l heard the beat of my heart from the start -You're late. -Sorry. We were waiting. Take a seat. -Hello. -How are you? Good night. Gentlemen, he who hears a "Viva Espaa"' but doesn't respond '"Viva Espaa if a man, he's not Spanish; and if Spanish, he's not a man. -Viva Espaa. -Viva Espaa! Two. Four. Three. l shared the risk of ruin without precedent and without a voice in decision or opinion. He never abandoned a game, he always wanted more and l wasn't used to it Cards. How many? Two. He lived permanently on the edge. And he was taking me there. -Nervous? -Worried. This is the game. Win some, lose some. l don't understand your relationship. Why do you let her work in a whore house? Maybe this is the only possible relationship. -How is it she's always waiting? -lt's a whim. -Hello, princess. -Hello. Why did he change when they were together?. Hello Vicent. My table? Perfect. Did his standard of living inhibit a traditional relationship? Maybe that was it Still it seemed inconceivable, strange. They've been partying for a week. More than tired, they're fed up with the sexual marathon. How do you know? Excuse me, what are you doing here? We're students on vacation. And your friends, what? Having sweet dreams? -We're going to the beach. -The beach? And then Marbella. But we don't know when. Go on, accompany her. Don't worry about your friends. l'll take them home later. Did you hear?. You're not going to move? l'm leaving. Go, damn it. l don't remember her face or body. Only that she gave me three days and three nights of sex. When you're happy you don't notice time passing. Here. lt's for you. You'll like it. Histoire du cinema. The ''J'ai lu'' edition. Thanks, Catherine. You don't know how much it means. You should have lived May of'68, everyone was active. Power to the imagination. Not just in Paris, in all cities. l can introduce you to a friend who took part in the occupation of Cannes Film Festival The people breathed desire, happiness. lt impacted me, maybe for the sexual influence or because it revived in me the seed of rebellion. l didn't pay to screw and even managed to get some ideology classes. Yes, power to imagination. Ferran! Ferran! -They're looking for you. -Why? Because you haven't been home since Friday. Your folks called the cops and all the hospitals. -Are you going to the village? -Yes. Go by my place and say l'm ok. -Why not call? -l don't want to argue with them. lt'll be calm by the afternoon. -Do me this favour. -Where've you been? ln paradise with a French girl, free, left-winged and educated, just for me. Ferran, speak so l can understand you. You're a champ! Goddamnit! Champ! -l have to go back to the village. -You're not coming to Marbella? You know what we've been through? You didn't even call. What's it matter? lt's not so bad, woman. You defend him. This is what they taught you? and 3000 more. l'm out. l pass. Thank you, gentlemen. Here. Thanks. -Want a sandwich? -No, thanks. lt scares me. The stakes are high. You're doing well. You should be careful. l'm doing well 'cause l'm not careful. They're scared. -Don't push your luck. -They don't know l'm bluffing. And if you give them a break? You're fleecing them. They get confident and commit. Perfect. lf they don't add their own money, they have nothing to do. The money on the table is mine. lf l lose, l'll lose theirs, which is not much. lf l win, l'll make them put more money. The more they put, the more afraid they'll be. l can't give them any breaks. That one is getting a transfussion. He must have lost everything. Cut. His ego unbalanced him, his vehemence despised the possibility that anyone was better than him. He was the best, but now he played at a disadvantage. -Speak. -l'm out. Pass. Fold. Fold. Two. What do you have? Triple. l play it all. You had 54 from the start and you passed. -l got it in the second round. -Lie! -lt's not true. -lt's wrong, but it's legal. Get your hands out of there! God Damnit! This is no time to fight. -Chino, you should have killed him. -He can't escape. You can be sure he won't be back here. -Good night. -Night. What will you do? There's nowhere on earth he can hide. You'll see. l found a job in a canned foods warehouse. Really? Good hours. Afternoons. Where is it? By the port. No ilegal alchohol? l told you, it's canned foods. l don't know where they come from and l don't care. Who got you this job? l don't need any help. l take care of myself, ok? How did he turn out this way? -l hope they are the last. -Don't be so touchy. lf l find out who stole the cake... l invite the priest every day and he won't say hello. -lgnore him. -ls this a joke? Take it easy. -What bastard could steal it? -Calm down. -lt's because l'm a Moor. -What would you do if you knew? l'm not saying. Going to Valncia tonight? l go everynight. l'd rather come alone than in bad company. Whenever l can. -l don't need anyone to go party. -No? No. What do you think? We don't see you very often. Orange soda. With rum. Awhisky. lt's quite busy. You can choose. Where's Rosa? She just came down. She's with a client. l like... l like the plump one. How are you? Good, but you must tell me what happened. -You came for me? -Of course. lt's been a long while. l said he wouldn't escape and he hasn't What happened? What have you done? -l got him. -How? -Playing. -Did you play a game? -They were warned. -And still let him play? The instructions were that they consent until l beat him. l was told he was at a casino. l arrived in the thick of it. -54? -Poker. You should have seen his face when he saw me. He realized that everyone knew. l said l'd chase him till l got all he'd stolen. l didn't care what we'd play or where. l wouldn't rest. -But l gave him an opportunity. -How? lf he was able to beat me that night without cheating, l'd let him go. But he had to come with cards. -Did he accept? -He had no choice. lf not, he wouldn't have played again. So you've recovered it? l won double what l lost. l'm on a roll. l have to take proffit. More? bet the winnings. lt's the only way to win. We'll pay the bank back and divide the rest. Are you sure? l'll give you 20% of the pot. Good. -Did you come with the Moor? -Yeh, by taxi. How'd he handle the cake issue? Traumatized. Everyone's laughing at him. -One day l'll tell him it was me. -Give it some time. Need a lift home? l'll go back to the village with the Moor. Do you have everything? -See you tomorrow. -Bye. The plump one won't forget me. She's satisfied. Let's go to another bar, kid. l don't have much cash. Maybe another day... His presence brought the games standing. He played against everyone, and they all wanted to beat him. That delirium exhausted me, but he enjoyed it immensely. His card-shark nature, unleashed, possessed him. l'll play it all on the highest card. -What is ''it all''? -All the cash l have. What's on the table and in my pocket. Two cards against one. lf one of your cards beats mine, l'll pay up. l'm not supporting you. And you? lf you lose, you only pay half of what l have. lf you win, l'll give you it all. You'll pay these. The game went well for you. You'll only lose part of your winnings. No. l pass. -l accept. But l lift the card. -As you like. l shuffle. You cut and choose. -lt's all good, right? -No. One day they'll turn out bad. -When it happens, we'll talk. -No. We'll talk now. My position's delicate. lf we can't pay the bank, they'll all find out. Take it easy. l've got trouble at home. No need to complicate it. lt's going well! l'm on a roll! lt'll go well when we have payed the bank. -lt's paid. We have lots of money. -So pay it. lt's ok. lt's ok. Another hand. We double and pay it. No. Pay it tomorrow. lf we pay the bank, we won't have enough to play. We need to double the pot to win more. lt's all or nothing, again. There's still time to pay it. lt's better if we have the money, not the bank. You worry too much. Just one hand. lt'll be your last. Your 2000... and 5000 more. No. The 2. your 5... -Who is it? -A nut. Afarmer from Castell, a kamikaze without a cause. Apparently he has tons of money. But he's not so bright. Everything. l bet it all. lt isn't worth taking. You haven't put a 1l4 on the table... lf you let me owe you, l'll bet what you have. lt's five times what you have. Are you sure? Yes. Show your cards. with those cards? Are you crazy or what? You can come get the money tomorrow. Here's the tally and the address. lt's been a pleasure. -Will you make him pay? -Of course. And throwing money around like that, he must be loaded. l hate playing against complete idiots. Yesterday's winnings double the total. No. Agood game gives you much more. So you don't complain, l'd pay the banks. What if he gave us a false address? We'd say goodbye to a lot of the money we're counting on. But we can make it all back. -Good morning. -Hello. Vicent Llorens? Boy! -What do you want? -To get paid. We can't pay it. -Card debts are sacred. -Does he live here? -ls he your husband? -l'm a widow. He's my brother. l'm sorry but this money's mine. l'd have paid him if he had won. lt's fair that he pays. -We can't pay. -What do you think l should do? l don't know. lt's not the 1st time this happens with the damn cards. l understand, but we don't have that much money. Relax. l'll take care of it. Leave us alone. -l'll pay you. -How? Every 10 days, l'll pay a part of the debt. Wait. You're paying a debt, not buying a fridge. -Will you pay me in Valncia? -l don't go often. They don't let you play here now, do they? You're black-balled. You'll play in Valncia until they get to know you, and then you'll go somewhere else. You need a solution. -l want to pay. -l want you to pay. -Will you accept a delivery of manure? -What? Chicken. -Chicken shit. -Chicken shit? -1st class manure. -Excellent. -What will l do with chicken shit? -Sell it. l swear it has a good market. -You pay everyone with shit? -You wouldn't believe it but... What? You need all the shit in the world to cover your debts. You're a rotten player. But as you pay with chicken crap... l insist it's high quality. l swear l'll punch you! -Take it easy, Chino. -Take it easy? That fucker wants to pay his debts with shit. -Hitting him won't solve things. -l'll let off steam. Listen, seriously. lf l hear about you playing not only will l kick your ass, but you'll have to pay double, in cash, for all the trouble. Understand? l have friends everywhere, in every game. lf you play, l'll know. -Do you understand? -l do. Don't play with me. Goodbye. -Thank you, sir. -You're welcome, house-wrecker. Hey, is chicken shit that good? There's other shit, but this shit is the best. l thought manure came from Chile. At home we had chickens, and we used the shit to enrich the earth in the garden. l've unpacked a ton of shit! You cleaned ditches, transported chicken shit... Hadn't you studied with the Jesuits? Good, this incident means we must play as soon as possible in the secret casino. The village isn't ideal to double the earnings. -But the casino is? -lt has no limits. -Never been in one? -No. Get ready for a real experience. Let's go, Ferran. lt's time. What are you up to now? Sedamueble, lnc. Furniture sales. ln the caf? The Moor brought them. lt's provisional. l'm looking for an office. They can send you mail at home. l don't want help. l can do it myself. -And you're ok? -ljust started. lt's better to be a businessman than working in canned foods. Like this you'll get far. Fucking Moor. He brought you the letters home. Relax. Tonight's winnings will get us to Madrid. We'll get rich. Then Vegas. You'll see the craziness. The game of games. Yeh, but first... Vegas is like fireworks in crescendo. They even play in the pools of the hotels. lncredible, man. l dream about getting there. lsles and isles of card tables, -100's of slot machines... -Yeh but... Gaming paradise. You live, sleep, eat gambling. Las Vegas. lt's been so long. -A friend. -Trustworthy? -Of course! -Enter. What do you want me to play, poker or 54? Gentlemen, l'm out. Your 1000, 2000 more. -Two. -One. l'll see them. Gentlemen, 54. l'll see them. Well, a rest, gentlemen? Friends, one day you'll find that l loved a whore who was a princess, who left me along the longest and darkest way of my life. But l will always imagine her at my side, in her radiant beauty. l'll describe her: she's a beauty, a whore and a princess. She was mine. lf you see her, tell her l'm still here, in the same brothel where l loved her for the 1st time. Tell her l still love her, as far as she may be. Tell her to be happy, to be at peace, because in my sleeplessness l'll watch over her rest and in a soft voice, so as not to wake her, as if she were still in my arms, l'll tenderly say to her, ''Good night, princess whore.'' Let's play? Your 2000... l'll see 3000... and 5000. Cards on the table. Police! Calm down! Please! Police! Open the door! Move it, damn it! Well, well, well... Outside, one by one. Let's go! Mouths shut! Lighten up, they'll just write us up. Write us up? We'll be in the papers? They'll look at our lD and take our money. ''Confiscated by government order'', of course. Well, well, well... lf you reopen the gambling den, you'll go to the pen. lt won't happen again. You stay here for now. Take him away. The others... -Sir... -What the hell? -l'm only... -Hey, Nicasio. How come you're here? How are you, sir? How am l? Take him away. Gentlemen, gambling is prohibited. l'm confiscating all the money. This time l won't arrest you. We've made note of who you are. lf this happens again, we'll arrest and book you. Understand? Give them back. -Pedro Climent. -That's me. Thanks. -Jos Gispert. -Me. -Carlos Barber. -Here. Fernando Torrent. Vicente Domenech. Marcos Baixauli. Thanks. Antonio Lloris. Chino, l resign. -But it was only minor. -Minor? ln addition to the bank scam, it'll get us in trouble. Anything is trouble for you. What shit is this? Why don't you tell me? l won't assume that this means a lot to you. For me, it does. Really, Chino, l consider myself your friend. Agood friend. l admire you, but there's a limit. -Do you know your limits? -Yes. What luck. l don't. -Really? -No. Maybe l have none. What's wrong? What are you affraid of? Use your imagination, fake revolutionary. Get on the train, see where you end up. You could always jump off. -How often have you been taken in? -Never. l'm sure the owner of the house and Nicasio work with the cops. -lf you knew, why...? -Doesn't always happen. lt didn't matter. With the cheater, the chicken shit addict and the cops, something always gets between us and the money. Tomorrow we'll fix it, ok? -Are you sure? -On my word. l gave you my word and l came through on it. What's it about? Wear a nice suit, like mine. Are you shitting me? l don't have a suit. You don't have dress pants or a jacket? Change and come. -Can you explain? -l'll explain on the way. Let's go. Hurry. We need to be in Cullera by 2. The bank's closing. Nothing. A check round. l work with them and Hispano. Here, l'll deposit from Hispano. Normally, they don't give the money till they get approval unless the director does me a favor... And credit it quickly. We need the cash to buy furniture we already sold. l trust you, Baixauli, but... We can't miss this opportunity. We need to buy the whole set. l'm a good client. l think l deserve some confidence. This isn't about confidence, which of course l have. But after we give you the money and before you pay back the inspector could check in. -Why would he come? -He makes surprise visits. When was the last inspection? They haven't made one since l've been here. -Damn! Well... -lt's only been 2 years. Let's see, we're talking about 8 to 10 days. lf not, l'll have to go to another bank. -8 days, no more. -Maybe less. -And the comission? -What comission? For creating a fake society. On top of teaching you to live? Learn how things work. Should l specialize in cheating the bank? That's life. Good afternoon. -Are you open? -Yes. Give me a whisky. Dyc. Are you bored? No. -Where's Rosa? -She doesn't work here anymore. Where is she now? -l was looking for you at the Cartago. -You didn't see Rosa, did you? -Didn't look. -Do you like her? Yes. Liar. You've been 2 or 3 times to look for her. She told you? Chino, l... -Would you like to fuck her? -Man... Yes or no? Yeh. l would. But not like you think. There're 100s... And of all the whores, you'd choose her. Yes. -But you don't dare because of me. -Yes. She's a princess. She's where a woman like her should be. Where? ln her village with her brother. He's her only family. Maybe she loves the man who saved her. She's only grateful. Will you go see her some day? Listen, it's gotten complicated. Officially, l've disappeared. The banks want money... What will you do? l've closed the company. You've done it? -You're problem free. -You, too. So you're a few days late. Pay the banks. lt's that l don't want to. lt wouldn't make a difference. They won't do me the favor again. So... l'm going to Madrid. -The normal. -Madrid? Forever? For now, a return trip. Here everything's old. The games there are better with more money. Are you going for the game or the banks? A little of both. Here l've become famous. When things calm down, will you be back? Don't know. No plans. And you? -l'd like to see a game in Madrid. -l'm going Thursday to Sunday. l don't have much cash. The ticket and hotel in exchange for what l owe you. -l haven't payed off my debt. -l'll keep it in mind. So, turning a new page. A new adventure. You don't miss anything from before? Superstitions are different in Madrid. To light 3 cigarettes with one hand is bad luck. -For who? -For you and whoever sees you. Don't look at them. l will. l'll light as many as possible with one hand. l'll enjoy doing it. -Expresso with Terry. -Coffee with milk. Here the jinx stands behind whoever's winning. -l'll go behind. -lf they do it, do the same. They won't burn you. -But they think you will. -l'm not good at it. They don't know. Every player has a jinx. He can use it when he wants. Even in illegal casinos they have day-wages. You can tell cause they got faces white as a sheet. You look skinny, but good. Let's go, game's at 11. lf you think you'll win, you will. -Good evening. -Hello. lDs, please. Baixauli? Where's that name from? The postman. Mr. Marcos? Wait for me. -Good evening. -Hello. Nice to meet you. Like-wise. -l'll see that. -l'll see that. Me, too. Your 100 and 200 more. -200. -l'll see that, too. l'm in. Pass. Let's rest, please. l asked for a rest. -How's it going? -lt's going. -And the jinxs? -A bunch of idiots. -What's your strategy? -Let them do it. They think l'm a cheapskate. l only bet with good cards. -When will you catch them? -Not sure, yet. There's no time limit in the game. Maybe in a couple hours. l'm bored. lf l don't need you it's better. He won a lot of money. A lot. He won... and won... and won. What did l tell you? Here l'll strike gold, Ferran. You could pay off your debts to the banks. They'd take you off the black list. Simple soul, you worry about the banks. Here's to Madrid! Next Thursday we'll go back to Madrid. l was ignoring that it was the last day l'd see Chino. The last day l spoke with him was the evening of the day he returned to Madrid. Not that l don't want to, but l can't go to Madrid tomorrow. No. lt's not family. lt's... A friend's in trouble. lt's about politics. l'll tell you later. See you Thursday afternoon at the bar. Ok. Hope you understand. We'll go another day. Those were the last words. Chino didn't show up. l waited from noon til 5 in the afternoon. Next day l went back, but nothing. Saturday l went by the games. No-one knew anything. Sunday l called the place where we stayed in Madrid. He wasn't there. He hadn't come back. He had my number. l figured he'd call. The following Thursday there was still no news. 5 hours more to wait For some weeks l went to the games and asked about him. -lf you see him, let me know, ok? -Sure. -Chino hasn't been around? -No, he's in Madrid. Everyone said he was in Madrid. But where? Playing. l knew he played. Why didn't he call? Did he think my not going with him was a way of distancing myself?. After afew months without news, l gave up. -Want to play a game? -No. l'm not up to it. Normality seeped into my life. l missed him, but thought knowing him had been an adventure, a matter of circumstance. Turn the page, l told myself. 34 years later, fate sent me back to the previous page, to a professional game. l played to win, not so much the money as the confidence and conviction that l was able to confront my fears. lt's yours. l won a lot. Thank you. lt's been a pleasure. Alex. You're a champ. Been ages since l've seen someone with such luck. -l had something to prove myself. -Good. But never again. lt scares me to win, especially to a pro. That's not normal. You end up losing the same or more. And if you lose, you'll play again. l'm afraid l might become addicted. Truth is the game brings satisfaction and misfortune too. l hate casinos. And bingo parlors even more. They're the addiction of the poor. For me it's too late to fix. l've been playing more than 40 years. Do you like the paella? For curiosity, to know things about a man who'd been at the tables for nearly half a century, l met him for lunch the next day. Which players do you like and which ones do you hate? Nowadays it's all the same to me, but throughout life l've confronted real lunatics. Vicent of Sueca, Ximo Sents... Chino... Chino? -You knew Chino? -A true player. l met him in Madrid. We both came from Valncia and gambled, that made us friends. He had good luck. He won a fortune thanks to the cards and casinos of France. A rum and... a couple cigars? No. A little cigar. l'll give it to you. A glass of whisky. -Do you know if he made it to Vegas? -No idea. -l'd say he did. -What do you think? Real gamblers have a fixation with Vegas. Vegas is a common-place. An amusment park for tourists and old folks. Chino would have laughed at them. He was something... His life was a novel. A novel? No player knows when it's time to quit. Man, no player wants to quit. Chino was special. He was a little crazy, self-destructtive above the normal player. He didn't feel integrated. He grew up in an orphanage. Didn't know his father and his mother was a prostitute, he was adopted and returned twice. He was really proud. He escaped three times. The 4th time they didn't find him. l guess the poor nuns felt really relieved. Thanks. The players interest me more than the game. What did Chino have that other players didn't? -For me, it was something personal. -Why? He was like a brother. Between the social revolution and the moral revolt of the time, he helped me get from the front lines to the big time. l even went with him to Madrid the 1st time. After, l didn't have any news. He roped me into swindling the banks. He tried in Madrid also, but it didn't turn out. He fell into the trap of the moneylenders. With one who he owed a lot of money, he proposed to cancel the debt with a game of Russian Roulet. The debtor accepted. lt was on the outskirts, near the road to La Corua. There were 15 or 20 people there. l didn't go. l don't like that game. Gentlemen. When it was all ready, he took the initiative in the challenge. l'll play twice. First, for the debt. Then for a million. A million pesetas between everyone. lmagine, a guy capable of playing with his life twice in the same night The guys were rubbing their hands. He still made another request. One more thing. lf l die, bury me... There, in that little forest. Ok? Typical of him. As if to say, ''l give you a moment of emotion in your boring lives. Enjoy Chino.'' He was crazy. He needed everyone's permanent attention. Maybe it's what he missed in childhood. For months, in Madrid they spoke of nothing else. His fame broke the boundaries. People with money payed enormous sums to see Russian Roulet. l lost contact with him. The last time l saw him, he lived in the Ritz. He'd won a lot of money. So much. What need did he have to play with his life if he'd won enough to live with all the comforts? To know he wouldn't doubt before the final challenge. The true size of the abyss. l ask myself if Chino existed or if he wasjust the result of my wayward imagination, of my desire to betray a stupid moral, imbedded like a staple in my mind, of my childlike insistence on inventing a paradigm to protect me from a structured, mediocre life. Chino was my god for a long time. He should still be, because l am still that coward affraid to learn the radical leasons of living against social conventions. l'm still useless, incapable of freeing myself from the safety of the vulgar day-to-day. ln some lush European forest is buried the body of a man destroyed by the routine life. Of an anguished breed, a player, a drinker, a night creature. Nationality, loser. Like a marked card. An abysmal life. LlFE ON THE EDGE
