But it won't happen again. The next one will be right. I'll make it right. Happy birthday, Daddy. Entirely consistent with the war effort. That's fantastic! Make a wish, Daddy. I'll get the champagne. Champagne! By golly. - Would you like to pass them around? - Yeah. - Nothing like champagne. - One there. - Thank you. - And there. I'm trying to get mine. What about me? I'm sorry, General. Pub just closed. A toast. To Jamie. To Jamie. Jamie. Where'd you get this? I've got connections, too, you know. Connections? I hope the airport knows where you're coming from. We have an understanding. We have an understanding whereby he shares my beer, and I share his champagne. - That's not a bad deal. - Very good. What about... Thank you. I'm just saying... Sweetheart? A very happy birthday. Hey, what's this? Jamie, it's all I could think of. How nice. Engraved and everything. "To Jamie. Love, Sue. " Okay, lovers, break it up. Come on. Give him a chance to get drunk at his own party, Sue. You have just ruined a very beautiful moment. Sorry, my dear. How do you like the present my wife gave me? Ah, it's nice. - Can I be the first? - It would be a pleasure. Allow me. Please. Jamie, I hate to change the subject, but you do know that Operation Mad Dog is under heavy attack, don't you? Yes, I know. Captain Franklin. He stopped you once. He'll try and stop you again. We'll see what happens at that meeting tomorrow. And am I now being told that in spite of the negative opinions of the naval and military planners, plus the doubts expressed by the Air Vice Marshall on Air Support- in spite of all this, we are still considering Major Wilson's lunatic operation Mad Dog? That is correct. I was under the impression we'd killed Mad Dog months ago. So we had. It was dead, but it wouldn't lie down. We're reevaluating it. You'll forgive me if I fail to see why. I Branch came through with a massive up-to-date intelligence from French underground sources. Soft points, dummy gun positions, sea patrol timings. A very revealing picture of Le Clair's overall defense plan. And you think that's enough to destroy a target which up to now has defied all our efforts, including pinpoint bombing by the RAF? When added to the new demolition plan I've already submitted, yes. To go into Le Clair, to launch Mad Dog, is madness. Another disaster like La Plage, where 390-odd out of 500 men were killed in a matter of minutes. Captain, if I may- Where Major Wilson's own Commando Unit lost 60% of its men- a record casualty rate by any standards. This operation can be a suicidal mistake, and I want no part of it! Major? Not to go into Le Clair would be a mistake. As long as this installation- the heart and sinew of a German surface fleet-is in being, thousands of tons of our shipping will continue to be sunk every week. Why? Because at Le Clair, German warships can be refitted, refueled, and repaired in almost complete safety. Destroy this big dock, and you immobilize the German surface fleet, to say nothing of putting a fatal dent into what the Nazi High Command so proudly calls the "Iron Coast. " Commander Kimberly, have your views on Mad Dog changed at all? Well, sir, I think that Major Wilson's idea of packing the bow of a destroyer with tons of high explosives and then ramming the dock at Le Clair is... Well, it's imaginative. But I think it's more romantic than practical. I'm afraid, sir, much would have to be done to give this plan even the smallest chance of succeeding. For example, we've gone into great detail about how to get into Le Clair. Nothing has been said about how we get out. Major? How would you get out? I was under the impression that getting in was the important thing. Mad dogs and Canadians. From a purely military point of view, the operation must be viewed as unsound. However, so was the idea of the Trojan horse. I think Mad Dog is well worth the risk it involves. Dammit, sir, I request permission to withdraw from any further participation in this! Not granted. Yes, sir. Captain, I respect your concern with this operation. You may be right... ...but Number 10 Downing Street wants something like this. It's audacious, gentlemen. It's mad. It's just mad enough to work. Go, go! Move fast, men! Move, move! Come on, move! Move! Let's go! Come on! Over to the target! Up! Up, up and over! Don't wait for the man in front of you! Go! Go! Well, he's certainly got them cracking. Come on, come on! Come on, move it there! Move! I doubt if the Germans will be impressed. Well, we've selected a moonless night to go in. This blindfold lark should really help their orientation. Go, go, go! Come on! Go! Come on, come on! Move! Pick your feet up! Move fast, men! Move, move! Don, we've got to stop him. Go around! Move now! Move fast! There are easier things to stop than a dedicated man. Dedicated? He's a fanatic! Swing along those poles! Keep your feet together! - Hello, darling. - Hello. Daddy! Hi, Timmy. - You're so late. - I know, I know. - Let me fix you a drink. - Good. I waited up for you. Come on, play with me. Not now. Maybe-maybe later, huh? Straight whiskey. You promised. All right, Timmy. That's enough. Off to bed now. Good night, General. - Here you are, darling. - Thank you. Relax. Daddy, how many soldiers did you kill today? I didn't have time to count them all, General. Go! Come on, keep your heads down! Keep your heads down. Go! Go! Go! Keep it down! Keep low! Go! Go! Go! Keep down! All right, go! Keep down! Keep down! Down! Move! Fast, fast! Still at it, eh? I saw the RTS test. It's a beautiful job. It really does scramble radar. I told Captain Franklin that we'd like one mounted on the masthead, okay? - Look, if I'm in your way- - You're not. Jamie, I told you from the start what I think about this operation. Now, if that offends you, get someone else. I don't want someone else, I want you. But I want all that you have to give. You're getting it. And Franklin? Well, he's hardly a convert, but despite what you think of him, he's a very good officer. This scrambler was his brainchild. He delivers, Jamie. Then where are the ships and equipment that I ordered three weeks ago? Supplies are pretty tight these days. You wouldn't kill me, would you? The Royal Navy wouldn't be trying to give me the Royal you-know-what. - A lost order here, a slow delivery- - Come off it, Jamie. You think the Royal Navy's got nothing better to do than to wet-nurse you? Kimberly here. Yes. Yes. Thank you, Lieutenant. Bye. That was Franklin's office. Your equipment will be in at noon tomorrow. Put some beef into it. Make it real. They must be out of their minds. Who do they think they're kidding? They're not kidding. Captain Franklin and Don are aboard the Sweeper inspecting her now. This is it, huh? This is it. This stinking little bathtub. Now, just a minute, sir. - This is a fighting ship? - I beg your pardon. Major Wilson, Lieutenant Forrester. Sir, this vessel's a ship of the Line in His Majesty's Navy and has had nine battle engagements. I am her skipper. According to Captain Franklin, she is now expendable because of some crazy notion of the Army, who, it seems to me, ought to stay in their own britches. With your permission, sir, I'll leave you to figure out the details of the execution while I go below and comfort her ancient bones. You don't miss a chance to slur and downgrade this operation, do you? Even to the skipper of this garbage scow. Well, it won't work. You want to scuttle Mad Dog, but it won't work. This heap of scrap is not acceptable, and neither are those waterlogged fishing smacks. I'm going over your head, Captain. To the Admiral. He's on his way. Good, but before he gets here, let's get a few things straight. It's the La Plage raid, that's what's burning inside you. You and your staff room heroes should've called the whole thing off. The conditions were wrong, but you let us go in anyway. And when we lost how many men, Captain? You quote the figure often enough- Your own son among them. You couldn't accept it, could you? You needed an out. Did I? Yes. Yes, and I was it. Suddenly, it was my raid. Suddenly I was the-the pied piper. But you know better than that, don't you? You know that I didn't kill those men, that I didn't kill your son any more than you did. Jamie, for God's sake. At least he's got a reason to scrub this operation. What's yours, my friend? Look, Jamie, for the last time- Now, now, Don, let him rave on. I never charged him with killing anyone. He's charging himself for that. And that's why he wants this operation. He wants to wash the blood off his hands. Well, he's not going to use me for it. And you're not gonna stop me! Jamie, what are you- Nor your cabin boy! Ship's company. Attention! Morning. - Everything in order? - I think so, sir. Not for me it isn't, sir. This-well, whatever it is- is absolutely impossible. I just don't understand this kind of cooperation. It seems to be solid enough. It's not ideal, but it's a sturdy little ship. Aye. Sturdy she is, sir. Sturdy as a- As a cattle boat. Major, I hope you didn't expect something just off the slips. I didn't expect something off the junk pile either, sir. I was promised a destroyer, two escorts, and torpedo boats. What I got hardly fit the description. We made no promises, sir. We said we'd try. I appreciate your difficulties, Captain. In the circumstances, I think you've done very well. A damn sight better than I have. The RAF still won't give me a firm commitment for the air strike. Combined operations. Good God, sir, how can you expect- I expect this operation will go forward whether conditions are ideal or not. Unless you, as officer in charge of the military assault, ask to scrub it. We're going across. Now hear this. No smoking, and all naked lights to be extinguished until further orders. Now hear this. No smoking, and all naked lights to be extinguished until further orders. Go! Move! Faster, men, faster! Move! Fast, fast! Go, go, fast! No, no, no. Keep going! Don't wait for him. That's his problem. You're under heavy fire! Come on, get up, get up! Faster! Come on, get on your feet! Get moving in there! Move, move, move! Now hear this! The next troop will be landing under simulated battle conditions. Do not deviate to right or left. Your job is to get to your objective. Stand by! Go! Go! Come on! Go! Go! Come on, move! Go! Sergeant, get an ambulance! Bring a stretcher, quickly! Don? Look at me, boy, look. Where's that stretcher?! Will he be able to see? - You hear me? - I heard you, sir. I'm sure the doc will be able to tell you everything you want to know. What do you think? I think somebody ought to know better than to play such games. Doesn't Jerry do enough without you blokes getting in the act? It was an accident. - Who was to know that- - I should have. I should have known. I wanted it rough, but... Stop blaming yourself, Jamie. Jamie? Yes, Don. Yes? That commando... Is he gonna be all right? How many soldiers did you kill today? ...soldiers did you kill today... soldiers did you- Yes, Timmy? Darling, what's wrong? I'm sorry. Sorry I woke you. I've been watching you for some time. I don't know what's wrong with me, what's the matter. I thought I'd turned everything off... ...that nothing could touch me anymore. If it's Don you're worried about, the doctor said he'll be all right. It's just a matter of time. I can't seem to get him out of my mind. You can't blame yourself. It was an accident. An accident! Military risk! Fortunes of war! I'm scared, Sue. All of sudden... I'm scared. I'm wondering if what I'm doing... ...is right. I'm wondering if-if one man should have this power to... ...this power to decide on... life and death. Nobody has that power. So get it over with. Finish it. Come back to me before it's too late. You've been a stranger. And over a period of six weeks, eight men dead, killed, thirty-two men injured, fourteen hospitalized. Training accident. Three small boats destroyed. Training accident. And what's even more to the point, the only senior officer ready and capable of taking this expedition into Le Clair is now... Training accident. Mad Dog must be cancelled, the men and materials must be released for duties elsewhere. Frankly, gentlemen, an operation of this caliber must have a respectable chance of succeeding. Obviously, we've been fooling ourselves. With your permission, sir. Carry on, Commander. During the past several weeks, I have had time to think about Operation Mad Dog... ...and about Major Wilson. I think I understand him better now. I saw him forced to accept inferior and substandard equipment. I saw him pushing his men on ruthlessly. Training them under simulated battle conditions. I saw men die in his training, and I was sickened by it. But for every man we lose now, ten will survive at Le Clair. It's part of the risk. It's the price you pay for success. Major Wilson knows this. And he has my support. Thank you, Commander. Any comment, Captain? I strongly advise a postponement of two or three months until Commander Kimberly is fit for duty. Then we can- Postponement is out of the question. We've got to move within six days or not at all. The tide and moon are right. Weather predictions are good. Also, there's a strong rumor that the Ostwind has suffered heavy damage and will put in at Le Clair. If we destroy the docks, one of Germany's largest battleships will be helpless. An open target. Did you hear that rumor, Freddie? No, but that doesn't mean it's not true. Yes. Yes, I suppose so. I want this operation. I want it badly. But without the commander- There is an officer, sir. One of the best I've served under. Would you accept going in without a senior naval officer? Admiral, I won't accept it! The Major can go in with his own men, but I'm damned if he'll command mine! Captain, I want this operation. Have you established rendezvous? Yes, sir. Our ETD is 1700 hours Portsmouth. On Wednesday. Very good. I think that's all, Michael, isn't it? I think so, sir. The party's yours, Captain. Good luck. Is that an order, sir? That's an order. Say when. When. I'd never have done it without your help. I sure thank you, Don. No need to thank me, Jamie. Well, they've given you the green light, but God knows what you're letting yourself in for. I hope you meant what you said. Yes, I meant it. Jamie, I'm sorry about Franklin, but there was no other way. All I want is for him to do his job. He'll do it. When did he last see action? A man like him never loses his sea legs. I hope to God you're right. You'll get well again. All in good time. Who knows? Maybe they've given me a break. Be lucky, Jamie. Yes. Thank you. - Port ten. - Port ten, sir. Ten degrees, port wheel on, sir. - Midships. - Midships, sir. - Steady as she goes. - Aye-aye, sir. Captain, if it's a few more revolutions you're wanting- Skipper, she's doing just fine. Bless her old heart. It's just like a mill pond out there. The weather boys' predictions were right on the nose. Well, there'll be no seasickness on this trip. Don't be so optimistic, Major. A steady swell, cramped conditions below, and the thought of the job ahead- some of your men are bound to throw up. And it won't be any better on those launches either. No. Not if we have to crawl along at this speed. Major, we are not crawling. Our speed's governed by the load in the bows and the launches' ability to keep station with us. You mean they'll have to play follow the leader all the way across? They're neither equipped with wireless nor radar. They're depending on us for protection and accurate navigation. And if we're intercepted, what then? Major, let's get something straight at the outset. You have your responsibilities, and I have mine, which happen to include the safety of those launches. Well, Jamie, here we go again. The way things were going, I thought we were making this trip in a dinghy. How are they below? Complaining. Puking. They'll get over the puking. Everything all right? For a vessel sailing to her own funeral, I'd say she's bearing up mighty well. Don't worry, sir. We'll get you there all right. Truce, Captain? I am not at war with you, Major. This ship is blacked out. What kind of a sailor are you? I'm a scared sailor, sir. You'll be a lot more scared after you've been court-martialed. I'll decide about that. He could've blown this whole mission. - Get back to your station. - Yes, sir. That man should be disciplined. That man's a naval rating. He's my responsibility. Then assume it. Radar to bridge. Radar to bridge. Contact, sir. Contact, Red 3-0. Hold it and keep reporting. Red 3-0. Aircraft closing fast. - Course? - 3-4-0. Action stations, gun crews close up. Signal disperse to the launches. Hold fire unless attacked. Lookout, aircraft coming up fine on port bow. Identify. - Course? - 1-7-6, sir. - Port ten. - Port ten, sir. - Steer, 0-9-0. - 0-9-0, sir. - You'll meet her head-on, sir. - That's the idea. Steady as she goes. Aye-aye, sir. Steady as she goes. Can't you do a zigzag? She's too heavy in the bow, sir. Gun crews, hold fire until ordered. All guns independent, open fire. A life on the ocean waves. Home on the rolling deep. Anybody want my dinner, just hold out your canteen. Cease fire. Cease fire. All stations keep closed up. Chief reports no damage, sir. - Casualties? - Every gun's crew, sir. Their pride's been hurt. He got away. Tell them not to worry about their pride, and signal close up, keep station. Aye-aye, sir. Well done. Normal naval procedure. When are we getting back on course? When I damn well say so. As long as you realize we're losing time. Losing time is better than losing a ship. That plane has reported our position and course, and I don't want Jerry to know we're heading directly for Le Clair. Any more questions? And Major... that cigarette incident had nothing to do with the attack. The plane was 30 miles away at the time. And that man wasn't a day over 16. You sent for me, sir. - What's your name? - Pringle, sir. Ordinary Seaman Thomas Pringle. How old are you, Pringle? Nineteen, sir. Sixteen. How long in the service? Six months, sir. And at sea? Three weeks. I'm sorry, sir, about the cigarette. I don't know what come over me, if you know what I mean, sir. I know. I just didn't stop to think, sir. Nor did I. Between the two of us, I lost my head. But maybe that's because I didn't want you to lose yours. Thank you, sir. Pringle. Sir? I can't take a thing like that, sir. Take it. Just come in, Herr Oberst. Hans, is this important? Nothing is more important than the ladies. "From K2C to Le Clair BHQ. Immediate. "Coastal air patrol report enemy minesweeper and escort "intercepted at Red 4-7-1, course due east. Attacked. Negative result. " Minesweepers, huh? What do you think, Erich? Where is it now? Red 4-7-1. Contacts like that every day. They sweep east up to Red 400, and then always turn back. Routine. Just routine. Nothing from our surface patrols? Nothing, Herr Oberst. The harbor approaches are well covered. If our ships get a sighting, you'll hear about it. Keep me informed, Hans, will you? The English are predictable, but they're not stupid. Jerry must've been alerted by now. It's strange we don't get another visit. The RAF has some heavy bombing raids planned. The Luftwaffe might well be too busy to worry about a minesweeper. They know darn well we're not sweeping. On the contrary. We've had sweepers visit this area a number of times during the past few weeks. Sowing minefields? Yes. But that's not the point. The idea was to let Jerry think that we were sweeping regularly, so that Mad Dog would look like a continuation of the routine. It was a subterfuge that may well play off. Who dreamed that one up? Their Lordships readily agreed to the value of the idea. Did you put it to them? It was a suggestion. ...on the earnings of a lady friend I know Don't want bullets in my basket... Hark ye to the serenade of brutal and licentious soldiery. How do we go, pilot? Most excellently, sir. Temperature 51, barometer 1-0, 1-0.3. Wind veering northwest, but nothing to worry about. Visibility good. On time, on course, sir. I don't want to be a soldier I don't want to fight the foe I would much prefer to roam or be kept right here at home On the earnings of a lady friend I know... A wee singsong's good for the nerves, they tell me. True, Skipper, true. I'm much happier, by far, with my mother and my pa So I wouldn't be a soldier any day Hey, Nobby! If you get hit on the beach, don't bleed all over me, all right? I'll remember, mate. And don't sleep on duty! All right! Once again! I don't want to be a soldier I don't want to fight the foe I would much prefer to roam or be kept right here at home... You know, if they sang a bit louder, maybe Jerry would clear off. I know I would. I'm surprised old Franklin hasn't sounded off about it. I don't think he will. Why? Has he gone deaf or something? Ever since that plane attack, he's loosened his collar a bit. Just the same, I think I'll tell them to pipe down. I don't want to fight the foe I would much prefer to roam Or be kept right here at home On the earnings of a lady friend I know All right, fellas! All right, boys! Knock it off! All right, fellas. All right, boys. Pipe down, pipe down. Fellas, fellas! Pipe down. You don't want Jerry to know what he's missing, do you? Hello, there. Hello, there. This is your captain speaking. We have now reached halfway. From this point on, all commandos will remain below deck until ordered. Ship's company will remain closed up. I'm now handing over to Major Wilson. At this moment, sealed orders are being opened aboard each of the craft astern of us. For the past three months, you've been training to attack a target without knowing its name or precise location. Here it is. Le Clair. The German fleet's most vital and important installation on the French coast. Our task, destruction. Our method, blowing up the dock, supported by commando assault. To that end, the bow of this vessel is packed with high explosives. We are, in fact, riding a floating torpedo. Our intention is to plow headfirst into the dry dock gates. We ram, scuttle the ship, and run. Run where? I'm sure you'll be interested in knowing that we will not explode on contact. Now, that's what I call considerate. From the moment of impact, we will have five minutes- repeat, five minutes- to get ashore and get clear. From then on, seek and destroy secondary targets. The signal for retirement- red, white, red by Verry light. You will embark on the small craft as designated, and, God willing, will be returned to England. Should you miss the boat, then proceed inland to points Freddie, Charlie, Baker, our French underground contacts. Good hunting... ...and good luck. And the best of Canadian luck to you, mate. Now, don't forget, boys. We're past the halfway mark- keep your voices down. I went on a day trip to Le Clair once. Any good? No. Horrible tea, horrible grub. But the women! They could hardly get me to go home. You'll be glad to go home tomorrow, matey. Bosun's Mate, break out the rum. Double tot for each man. God bless the Navy on a night like this. The night signals, Herr Oberst. You know something, my friend? We Germans, we eat too much. French food is fattening. Remind me to put in a strong complaint. There's been another attack on that radar station. You can hardly call it an attack. The saboteurs included a twelve-years-old boy. Those French will never learn. Of course, they are a nuisance. Have you heard any more about that minesweeper? Not a thing. Minesweeping. How those British waste their energy. Is perfect weather for an air attack and not a sign of the RAF. Twenty-four hours ago, you promised me RAF support. Where it is? Read this. I think this explains it. Yes, we've had heavy losses over Dusseldorf tonight. Take it from me, they gave us hell last night as well. The squadrons assigned to Mad Dog are not even respectable scrap. What have you got in reserve? Nothing we can spare without leaving ourselves wide open. - I'm sorry, but- - Sorry? I'm sorry for one rather ancient minesweeper and four cockleshells just hours away from Le Clair. They happen to be without escort of any kind. They're naked. Without a divisionary raid from Bomber Command, they'll be out there dead. Why didn't you give them some support? A couple of destroyers or even a cruiser. Because we don't have- That's what I mean. Not far now, huh, Pringle? Yes, sir. Time to quit being scared, huh? Have you been on one of these before, sir? Yes. This lighter, sir. It's brand-new. Who is Sue? My wife. She wouldn't go for you giving it to me, sir. She'd understand. You'd better hang on to it. I've got something with me from my sweetheart. Just received from DCO, sir. - Well, what is it? - It's an immediate, sir. "Immediate NOC 7-2 B4. Urgent. "Air diversion not available. "Cancel Mad Dog and return. Acknowledge. " No reply. Sir? I said no reply. Aye-aye, sir. - Pollard. - Sir? You didn't hear a word, did you? Me, sir? I've got cloth ears, sir. Thank you, Pollard. Captain. - Here you are. - Thank you, sir. It's 10:25 now. - Any acknowledgment from Mad Dog? - No, sir. - Send that off at once. - Yes, sir. - Yes, what is it? - Signal, sir. Read it. Read it. "Emergency. Await acknowledgment of 9-8-7-B-1. "Cancel-repeat-cancel Mad Dog. "Insist you comply with this instruction "and return at once. Acknowledge immediately. " Who's that addressed to? The captain, sir. All right, Sparks. Well, what do you make of that? Laddie, it's none of my business... ...but I think this old lady might be getting a reprieve. Why? Mad Dog cancelled. Why? What reason did they give? I don't understand, Franklin. You've been fighting this operation from the very beginning. Yet now they've called it off, you don't have a thing to say. Standing on the bridge, Major... ...it's different than sitting behind a desk. What's that supposed to mean? You feel closer to death. That makes you closer to life. And the truth comes rushing in. You didn't kill my son. He was a casualty of war. And it's a war we have to win. A war we have to win. Now, I have made the decision. We are not turning back. But you realize what it means. With no RAF to keep Jerry busy elsewhere, of course. Bombing the outskirts of that town would've been a good diversionary tactic. Exactly. But is it essential? If Le Clair is ready for us, yes. If not, if we surprise them, no. Your guess is as good as mine. For the record... I am in command as long as we are afloat. And I'm clearly disregarding an order. You can object on the grounds that without RAF participation, your force is inadequate. For the record, I'm deaf. Thanks. I didn't hear you. - Any word from them? - Not a word, sir. And the RAF? No change. This been checked? Double checked. What happens if the ship's power supply is cut? The firing circuit is entirely self-contained. Once it's set, nothing can stop it. Not even hitting the gates? No. The shock of impact won't detonate the charge. Only that clock can trigger the fuse. That's how we can guarantee the time interval for you to get clear of the ship. Well, we won't need much time. Anyway, the longer the explosion is delayed, the greater will be Jerry's surprise. With luck, by the time she goes up, this old lady will be crawling with inquisitive Germans. You can pass the word. In exactly 60 minutes from now, this ship explodes, whether we're aboard it or not. Aye-aye, sir. Time to start the minstrel show. - How are the men? - Fine, sir. They've got the picture? I trust they're clear on the function of the launches. Once they've been deployed, we'll be on our own. If they can reach the jetty without giving the game away and silence those batteries, we'll be in clover. Once the men have disembarked, will the launches lay off, sir? No, they'll stay alongside the jetty, ready and waiting to take us home. I want you to stress this to your men. If things get sticky, you'll be in a hurry. But that doesn't mean panic. Orderly embarkation. Understand? Yes, sir. There's room for everybody. Providing they keep to their groups and don't rush the first launch they see. They understand that, sir. Good. Then get them blacked up and standing by. That beard helps, but you need a touch. Thanks. Come on, girls! A little faster with your makeup. We'll be on pretty soon. We're not going to a party, you know. Come on, behind the ears, all over. Look nice for Daddy. How do I look, me darlings? You're not fit to be seen! You'll scare 'em to death, Sarge! Take your teeth out, Sarge. He looks like my grandmother. Battery D, sir. Patrol sighted, unidentified. What patrol? - Inside the estuary? - Inside, Herr Oberst. What do you mean, unidentified? German markings, German camouflage, but they don't give the correct code signals. "They"? What do you mean by "they"? The ship's in company with four launches. Four launches? What kind of launches? - I don't know, Herr Oberst. - Well, find out. Light flashing off the starboard bow, sir. Light flashing off the starboard bow, sir! He's challenging, sir. - In code? - Yes, sir. Make the repeat sign. Request repeat! He's called for an identification signal, sir. Then give it to him. Whitehall. 1-2-1-2. - But that's- - Enough to really confuse him. - What was that code number? - Whitehall 1-2-1-2. Well, you won't find it in there. Then it doesn't exist. Of course it exists! It's the telephone number of Scotland Yard. Stand by to signal deploy. Deploy. Sound the general alarm. Alert K Command. Send C and D companies to cover the airfield. Inform WB and Luftwaffe. All batteries to engage the enemy. I've released the launches, Major. They're on their way. If we knock out those heavy guns, we've got a chance. The launches should be ashore by now. There's a boat making for the dock. Making for the docks? Are you sure? Where are the gates? Open or shut? Shut. B Battery's under attack, sir. B Battery under attack? What are they, parachutists? Don't know, sir. Radar to bridge. Radar to bridge. 1-4- 1. Distance, five miles. Aircraft. Bridge to radar. Bridge to radar. Is there any IFF showing? Radar to bridge. IFF showing. Aircraft friendly. They're ours, sir. Remind me to compliment Bomber Command. Rather like the Navy, Major. They get there in the end. You give me that normal procedure bit again, and I'll... There you are, Commander. Some tea. I don't understand it. I've tried them five times already and no reply. They should be here, or they're... They could've ignored us and gone in anyway. RAF reports sighting Mad Dog in estuary, approximately three miles from target. Thanks for the good news. Three miles. She can't take much more of this. She won't have to. They're coming in under our guns, sir. Targets below our maximum depression. - And the number two position? - Minus 15 degrees. Clear the safety stops. Move target right! Pill box, dock corner. Yes, you're hitting them! Keep firing! Stand by for ramming. Stand by for ramming. Starboard a little. Meet her. Steady as she goes. Engine room, give her all she's got. If you'll pardon the expression, sir, you're about to see the ship hit the fan. She's all yours, Major. All commandos on deck. All commandos on deck. Get moving. The ship hit the dock. Hit the dock? Why? Why?! - What damage can it do? - Not much that can't be repaired- - Are we concentrated there? - Up to a point. Are we or aren't we? Companies C and D have moved to cover the airfield, sir. Bring them back, and get that ship out of the dock! Come on, come on, come on! Come on! - Sir, you all right? - Keep moving, sailor. Keep moving! Major. I don't know. But the wheelhouse got a direct hit. Was he still inside? I'm going back. Stay with him. Come on, move. You British. You are mad. Still fighting storybook wars. Do you really think that old tin can of yours can seriously damage 35 feet of concrete and steel? It's pathetic, Captain. Pathetic. You haven't got an answer, have you? There's your answer. All right, check them. Are you all right? The Major said to keep an eye on you, sir. Let's go. All right, come on, move! That's it, Graham. That's it, sir. - Fire the retire. - Yes, sir. It worked this time, Jamie.
