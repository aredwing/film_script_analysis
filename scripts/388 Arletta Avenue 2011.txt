Luckily we got nothing worth stealing. Let's do it. Don't run so fast. I don't understand. What's going on? Why did you set the alarm? I didn't set it. - But I don't want to go running. - I didn't set it, Amy. Well, a fucking elf must have set it. What are these? Jesus! Christ, Amy. Aww man... This is really not cool. I got up at 5 in the morning... Just gotta help me out here. Did someone send this to you? To me? Yeah. One of your little undergrad students? Or the professor, what-his-face with the nose-hairs? - No, I highly doubt it. - Because I didn't make it. OK James, you have so much music, every time I walk into your office, you are downloading something. I don't even make CDs anymore. OK. So what do you think? Somebody just made a CD and put it in the car? Wasn't this car door locked? Yes? OK So all I know is that I didn't make it. I didn't make it either, Amy. So made it? Isn't it weird to you, at all? Yes, I don't know, maybe. You... You forget things sometimes. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing, I'm just saying that you forget things sometimes. You know? What? Like when I drink? James ... All I'm saying is that I bet all of this music is right on your computer. No... No... Wait, what's that? - Are those the same songs? - What? - See? I told you. - What is this, your idea of a joke? - What, you think that I put those on there? - I know I sure as hell didn't. James, you have 8,000 songs on your computer. You probably just forgot. You think I have nothing better to do than to come in to your office, sneak around and make a mix CD? Honestly, I don't know what it is you do here all day Amy. You've been working on this afghan embroidery thesis for 7 years... Or what is it eight? You're an asshole. - Relax, I was joking. - No you're not. Hey, come on, help me figure this out. - Nasty little shit. - Amy, please. Amy. Hey. Come on, Amy. Is that you? Amy. Hey, you home? Amy. - Katherine, it's James. - Yeah, what's up? - Is Amy there with you? - No, why would she be here? - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. Did she, ah... say she was going away at all? - No... - She didn't? No. I got this note from her, saying that she ... needed to clear her head. - Why? - She didn't say. Did you guys have a fight or something? No. We... We didn't have a fight. - Is she mad at you? - Not that I know of. Not that you know of. What does that mean? It means what it means, not that I know of. Well, then James, I don't know where she is. OK. But if you talk to her, can you tell her to call me? ... Please. I'm worried. - What are you talking about? - Can you just do that? - Fine. - Thank you. Hi, you've reached Amy's cell. Leave a message. Hello Amy Amy Amy, is that you? Hey kitty, you scared me, I thought I left you outside. Come here. Hello. Amy He likes the oldies. Who ... likes the oldies? Whoever made this. - You like this kind of stuff. - I like everything. You really didn't, as some kinda joke or something? Is this funny? - Did she pack a bag? - A bag was packed. Ok. So there you go. She's... she's clearing her head. She's taking a vacation. From what? From... - You gotta admit you're not always the ... - What? I don't know. I don't think Amy made this CD. - Who did then? - I don't know. You think somebody's screwing with your head? I don't know. OK. Do you have a crazy ex-girlfriend? Somebody you work with? Bill Burrows, maybe? Yeah we were... really hard on that guy. - We? - No one laughed harder than you, Alex. You know... The original version of this song, They don't say "Jill." They say "Bill." His name was Bill. - Hey Cherrie. - Hey. What's up? We're cool, right? Yeah Are... Are you sure? Why wouldn't we be cool? There is no reason why. I just, uh... I dunno. Uhm... We're cool, right? Yeah. Get over yourself, James. Yeah. That's ... uh ... That's what I thought. Amy, it's me again. Look, If you don't want me to know where you are, that's fine. But just let me know you're okay. Alright? With everything going on right now, It would be really shitty of you if you just took off on vacation or something. So just let me know you're OK. That's it. I'm worried about you. Hello? Real funny... Real god damn funny. Katherine I know you're up there. Are you in on it too? - What are you doing? - Nice work! ... Well, she's gotta be here because I don't know where she is. My wife is missing and I know that she is hiding out at your guys' place. - Was it you? - Get out of my house. That's what you did. You set it [garbled] ... it's a really bad day for this ... Serves you right for screwing around on her. That's what this is? It's teach James a lesson? I told you to leave. You know what? She hit me in the head. - You were hurting her. - We were drunk. We were fooling around. Jesus! Stay away from me. Stay away from my house. Got it? I'm serious, stay away from my house. Tell your sister I know what she's up to. Hey Bill. James. Good to see you. What's up? I was just ah ... in the neighborhood, Seeing if you, I don't know ... If you're not busy, if you want to take a little drive and grab a coffee or something. ... Something I wanted to talk to you about for a long time. You sure we can't get you some breakfast? Some eggs? - Coffee? - Nah, I'm good. I was surprised I caught you at home this time of day. I work evenings, mostly. Doing what? They got me down at the humane society some nights. Oh yeah? You an animal lover? Someone's gotta be there at nights. You know, in case there's any freak outs. My cousin got me the job. Shit. Sorry if I woke you up then, working nights. - No, I don't sleep much. - Why not? I heard you were in Afghanistan. Yeah ... I remember you were all into military stuff in school. Joined the cadets, right? I remember you got teased a little bit for that. Yeah, I suppose. We were friends in third grade, you and me. If you remember... We would play Star Trek on the playground. I'd always be Kirk and you'd be Spock. Remember that? You used to do the vulcan... Yeah... Yeah, I got it. And then we just kind of drifted apart. But still, I feel shitty for ... ... For teasing, You know? I feel uh ... shitty for my part in that and ... it must make you angry, to think back on those days. Now I, I know that it was mean. It was ... really mean. It was just... ... It was weird. We were friends for a year. And then I spent the next ten torturing you. It was just relentless. I mean ... It must have just seemed totally random to you. You know, why? Why me? And I, I can't even answer that question. To be honest. It was just ... our screwed up idea of having fun. Hey, are you okay? - Huh? Yeah. Sorry. - It's alright. Hey, it's good to take your stuff home with you. But uh ... it's gotta get done. Yeah. I know. I have a bit of a situation. ... I will get it to you. What's the ETA on the Myers account? - James! - Yeah... Sorry. The Myers account? When's that happening? Really sorry. I have a bit of a situation at home. But I will have that to you by the end of the day. - Yeah. - I promise. - OK Amy are you home? Aw, come on! Hey Diggs. What are you doing? You alright, boy? So you don't think this is your cat? No, he's different, skinnier. There! That. He's never done that before. - He's never growled before? - Not like that, not at me. But otherwise, he looks the same. Yeah. Like I said, it's not just the cat, There's the CD, someone's been messing around with my computer. Something is going on. This is really what concerns me. Right here. Is this her handwriting? Yeah, I think so. But... So... - She needed to clear her head. - Something is going on. I mean, really, Mr Deakin. Who's going go and replace your cat? Hello... Anybody home? Anybody here? Hello? - What the hell are you doing? - Jesus! - How did you get in here? - I want to speak to Amy. - Come on, let's go. - What are you doing? - Get out. - What are you doing home on a work day? - Just get out of here. - I want to speak to Amy. - Amy - She's not here. - Amy - Amy! - Katherine, she's not here! You know what? She's not answering her phone, so I want to know what's going on. Just get out. Go! - Amy! - Go! I want to talk to my sister, James. Yeah, and I want to talk to my wife. Get out! - Come on Katherine, get out of my house. - Don't touch me! - What is the matter with you? - Get out! - You're hurting my arm! - Get the hell out of here then! You've done something, haven't you? Listen... So why can't I go in? There is a situation. I don't want you meddling. - Meddling in what? - I'm handling it, OK? Just go! Get your hands off me! I'm really calling the police now, James! I called the police. They don't do shit. I'm dealing with it. Jesus Christ! What the hell? Yes! They cut his head off. But you said the fake cat is still there? Yeah, it ... Yes, Amy's still gone. I haven't heard from her. - Did you check with work? - Yeah, yes. I called all her friends, I checked with the school, I checked her email, I called the airlines to see if she booked a flight. Nothing She asked you not to contact her though, right? I told you, I don't think she wrote that note. Listen, I need you to figure out what's going on. Alright? I need you to find my wife. - We can file a report. - That's great. Without any real evidence, it is all we can do. Listen... I'll just handle it myself then. Mr Deakin. Don't believe me? I'll get you some evidence then. Amy? Amy, you there? Who is this? Jesus. Jesus Christ. Who the hell? Yeah, give me the police. Is anybody down there? Hello, is anybody down there? Alright, it takes a second. Right there. Who is it? I don't know who it is. Now watch this. He obviously got in here. He said they did something to your cat. Did something? He cut his head off. But there is still a cat. - Yeah there is a cat, it's a fake cat. - It's a fake cat? - Yeah, he looks the same but it's ... - But you're sure it's a fake? Yeah I'm sure. Come here. That's what my cat looks like now. Jesus Christ! It's gone! What, you lost the head? No! Whoever did this came and they took it back. They took the cat head back? You saw the video. Someone's been coming and going in here Right. So you, you put the cat head in the freezer? Yeah. This hasn't come up a lot in my life. Is there a different protocol for severed cat head storage I should know about? I'm going to need you to calm down, sir. Alright? Calm down? When's the last time your cat was murdered? When's the last time your wife just disappeared? There was a note though, right? From your wife. Yeah... What are you going to do? What are you going to do about this? What would you like us to do about it Mr Deakin? Take it seriously for starters. I can assure you we are taking the disappearance of your wife very seriously. Did you or your wife have any trouble with any neighbors lately? No. Anyone from work, school? No. OK. Can you think of anyone who might want to do this to you? The last time we met, I remembered you were a big Jays fan. Got the whole team on there. '93 championship team. - I know it. It looks new. - It's been conditioned. You're the first person to touch it in probably 20 years. This must seem pretty weird to you, huh? I'm just having a bad week. In fact you might say I have a new found understanding for probably what you went through in school. Just to be harassed, you know? Not know what's coming next. Not know what ... horrible shit they're going to do next. Look, I'm sorry about all that stuff. You know? I mean it Bill. Anything you need ever, you let me know. I'm serious, man. I'm not that guy from school, you know? I ... That guy was a monster, I'm not him. Yeah. Alright. Has anyone ever done this before? No. Apologized for bad stuff ... - No, nobody has ever done this before. - Does it help? Bad stuff still happened. Let me ask you a question, Bill. Do you know where my wife is? - You don't know where your wife is? - No, I don't. Well, how would I know where your wife is? I'm not ... I'm not screwing around here, OK? If you've got a problem with me, let's keep it between you and me. Amy didn't do anything wrong, OK? - Something funny? - I'm just gonna... You're not going anywhere Buck. Where is Amy? Where the hell is she! You're still the same asshole Deakin! You know that? I'm wrong, I'm sorry OK? But you gotta understand what I'm going through right now, alright?. I understand, karma's a bitch. - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? I don't know, Katherine. I'll say it again. I don't know where she is. As far as I know she could be right next to you laughing her ass off right now. - James, I will bring the police. - Bring the police over, Katherine! - Yeah, I will. - They're not going to do anything. Trust me. - Well I don't trust you, James. - I'm, I'm hanging up the phone now Yeah, you better not have done any... What's next? What's next asshole! Bring it on ... Bill. Oh, Jesus. Amy. Open up Bill! Come on Bill! Open the door! - What are you doing? - Where is she? What do you want? Where she! Is she in there? Amy! You got my fucking wife in here! I'm going to kill you! Piece of shit! - Where is she! - Aaagh! Amy! Amy! Amy! I'm coming. I'm coming! No. No. No. No... Where the hell are you? Where the hell are you? - Hi. - Is this a bad time, Mr Deakin? Well, huh, I was... Yeah. Have you heard from Amy? Anything on Amy? I'm afraid not. But we did get a call today, however from a Bill Burrows. - What? - He said you've been harassing him. - Today? He called? - About an hour ago. - An hour ago? - You're familiar with him then? Yeah, we went to school together, I haven't seen him in years. Then you're suggesting he made this all up out of the blue? No, I called him. Like I said, I was checking people out. From my past. - But you didn't see him? - No. Do you mind if I come in for a minute, Mr Deakin? - Why? - Well, I just need to fill out a report. Well, I'm heading to work. If you prefer, we can go down to the station. Yeah, sure. Why don't I go after you? This is really against my better judgment, dude. You don't have to ... Trust me, it's in there. Yeah. OK. Thanks. - You're not going to use it, I hope? - I don't know. - Well, you didn't get it from me, right? - No, OK. You want to fill me in on what is going on? I get calls every god damn day from your sister in-law. She's freaking out. - Katherine called you? - Yeah, she's worried about Amy. - You haven't spoken to her? - Me? No. - Nothing happened? - What do you mean? - Between the two of you? - Like what? Anything I should be worried about? Nah. I'm dealing with it, OK? - What about Bill? - What about him? You eliminate him? What does that mean? From your list. You said you were going to go check him out. - Yeah, it's not Bill. - Not Bill. No, not Bill. Whoever you are... I get the feeling you can hear me. If you are somehow listening, I don't know why you're doing this. I think you're playing some kind of game with me. But I'm done. I'm not playing any more. OK? If you want me, I'm here. If you want to play, then come and see me. Hello... Need to talk to you. Don't hang up. Don't... Hello. Shit. Listen, I'm coming up. I just want to talk to you, OK? Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! You sonafabitch! You sonafabitch! Come on, where'd you go? How would you feel about me calling the police? White chevy van. License plate EM36PC. Here's what were going to do. I'm going to come home from work tomorrow. And Amy's going to be there, And everything's going to be back to normal, OK? You're going to forget about me and I'm going to forget about you. You hear me? Were going to move on, unless you'd rather deal with the police. Because they could fry us both at this point, if that's what you want. If you agree, then just hang up the phone. I said if you agree ... Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy... Oh god... Hello James. Amy? Amy it's Katherine. Mr Deakin. I see you. Deakin, you here? Son of a bitch! Nooo! He killed her! Put the gun down now! - He killed her. - No, It's not me. - Don't! - She's dead. - Oh God, oh God! - Katherine! - Oh God! - No! No!!! Shit.
