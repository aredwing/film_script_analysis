I'm fine, thanks. 7 and 2, 9... What? No, sorry, I wasn't talking to you. What were you saying? Okay, bye. No, wait! I can't come at 11, I'm busy in the morning. What? I have to get groceries, then tidy the rooms. I also do chores at another house around here. What? No, it's not a matter of... Hold on a minute. Ma'am? Professor, don't yell! She's not back yet, there's a couple in her room. Listen... Madam's not here, I'll tell her in morning. I'll meet you there if I can. I have to go to bed now, bye. Who was it? Did they want Madam? Who? No, it was a girl who was here last year, it was for me. Bye, I'm going to bed. - Professor? You got a girlfriend? - What's it to you? Get lost! Why? I can't even ask if you got a girlfriend, now! - Listen, you got a cigarette? - I'll go see. - We're done, we're leaving. - The room is free. - You already paid? - Yes, I settled everything with Madam. - Gina! - What is it? - You got a cigarette? - I'm with a john. - I'm sorry. Good morning, Ma'am. - Did you get milk? - Yes, it's on the stove. Tell Wanda to get up, she has to come with me for her blood tests. Go! Listen! Madam says you have to get up. Yeah... What? - Madam said you must get up. - What time is it? What does she want? - Get up! You have to come with me for your tests. - Get up! - Hurry up! - Pay attention to Madam, hurry up! Stay out of it, you helpless moron! Why do we keep this moron with us? - Ma'am, I'll take care of the cups. - Yeah, so you can break some more! What? No, no, no... Fuck no! You broke quite a few up as it is! What did you buy, yesterday? Did I tell you to get Provolone? - No... was it Stracchino? - Stracchino! I didn't tell you to get cheese, just bread, pasta, eggplant and eggs, that's it, no cheese. If you want cheese, buy it with your own money. And I want the change back, OK? - You have to bring me back the exact change, got it? - But, Ma'am... Professor! - Are you depressed? - Get lost! - Ma'am! - What? What do I have to buy today? Nothing, Gina will take care of it, and as of today, you can take a walk. Gina. - Gina! - Huh? What is it? - What is it? - I got kicked out. - You got kicked out? - Madam kicked me out. I'm sorry. - Would you turn the water heater on? - Yeah... right away. Did you buy my bubble bath? Of course I did! I got it on sale, I'll give you your change later. - I don't want it, you can keep it. - So, what do you think? She said, no more shopping for me, I can take a walk, as of today. This means she's kicking me out, doesn't it? How would I know? Are you asking me? Let me get up. Open the window. No, not wide open! Yes, that's fine. Don't take it so hard. You don't know if she'll kick you out, yet. She'll get over it, you'll see. You're saying she might not? You think she won't? - You'll see, she won't. - Why not? Why? - Because. You don't know yet! You know that son of a gun I brought here last night? You know what he did? He said: "You idiot, you said it was 30 euro. " I said that? I said it was 30 euro for the room! A real son of a gun. But I told him... Me too, I'm going to tell Madam, she can't kick me out just like that. Right? Yeah... Right. He? You got a cigarette? Here, help yourself. We're only a bunch of miserable wretches! Yeah... that's right. - You know, Lea called yesterday. - The girl who used to live here? Yeah, her. She said she wanted to see me today at 11. - What did she want? - She didn't say. I have to be in San Giovanni at 11. - Will you go? - No, I have to tidy the rooms. - Go, and see what she wants. I can take care of the rooms. - Would you? - Sure, and if you got kicked out, you don't have to! - That's for sure. What? Are you saying I got kicked out? You told me... What a pain! How do I know? Do you always have to be such a pain? Get out! Go on! Don't make me lose my patience! - You got the time? - No. Is it past 11? Professor! Professor, how are you? It's good to see you again. What about Madam? How is she? She kicked me out, she kicked me out this morning. She said I wasn't supposed to buy cheese and also, that I break her cups. But she's the one who told me to buy cheese. I remember she said to get bread, pasta, cheese and eggs. How could I forget? She even said: "Buy cheese at Pietrangeli's. " Let's not stay out here, let's find a cafe so you can tell me all about it. I asked you to come because I'd like you to run an errand for me. Do you want to smoke? - Here you go. - Sorry, you can't smoke in here. I'll take it anyway. I'll take two, I'll smoke them later. - Do you remember Marquise? - The other girl who lived with us? Yes, the pretty one that we called Marquise, remember her? - Yes, kind of skinny... - Not that skinny, quite the opposite... She wasn't? I don't know, I don't remember her very well, why? Because... Well... You see... Since she and I... Marquise and myself... - Yes, Gina told me. - Gina? What does she know? - Huh, no... I thought... - No! Well, the thing is... We took an apartment together since I had been working a lot in Rome, lately. - Are you listening to me? - Of course I am! But, since this summer in Fregene I have this opportunity with a guy to... that I could... I had told her right away: "Sweetie, don't get angry. " "You go to understand that at some point each of us must go its own separate way. " - Of course! - She was supposed to understand, right? - Sure. - And mind you, I told her she shouldn't take it badly. Didn't I tell her? But then she... Listen, are you eating this cream puff? Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God... - What is it? What's wrong? - She shot herself! Wow... Jeez! That's bad She's in the hospital now. Look, you got to do me a favor. I can't go see her because I'm leaving. I can't miss this opportunity to go my own way. - Then again, the nuns wouldn't let me in. - I see. So you should go see her and tell her that I put the keys in the little drawer and that I left a suitcase that I will send for, later on. - You got everything? - Yes. But most of all, you must tell her she shouldn't take it so hard and that when she will be discharged she shouldn't write me or anything, because she needs to understand that... - Yeah. - What? - I'm sorry, you were saying? - I was saying... Well, are you going? Where? Waiter, how much is it? No, I'm sorry, I got it, it's fine. It's just that... Will they let me in? Sure, I'll take you there. Just say that you are... her cousin. Please, it's really important. It will only take a couple of minutes. I'm going to get in trouble for this. You can't go outside visiting hours. Please, don't feel insulted. - Would you have coffee on me? - Alright then, but make it short. Thank you very much. Don't worry, it'll be fine. - Are you going to take him? - Yes. Are these ancient stones? - What? - Of ancient Rome? Listen, he will take you to her. Do you remember what I told you? Yes, the keys. The keys are in the little drawer, the suitcase, I'll send someone for it, and when she'll be discharged, she shouldn't write because... So, shall we? OK, then... bye. - I'm counting on you, OK? - Yes... Thank you. Bye, - Jeez, we made good money! - Keep it down... - Did my niece send you? - Who? Sorry, I thought my niece had sent you. Hi... Lea sent me. I was at the house in via Principe Amedeo, I don't know if you remember. She said that she left her keys in the little drawer and that when you will be discharged, you shouldn't... She can't hear you, they gave her morphine! She has a splintered fracture in her ribs. Jeez! That's bad! Not at all, it's a miracle she had no lung complications. You know, this will be my fourth surgery. - Listen, are you from Rome? - Who, me? Yes. Actually, not really, but I live in Rome. I thought my niece had sent you. No, I live in a house in via Principe Amedeo. - Oh, Via Principe Amedeo? - Yes. Although, I should say that I lived there because I got kicked out. - Really? - Yeah. I did chores in this house. This morning, the lady pretended that I... Before, and that would be yesterday, she told me what I had to buy, including cheese. If she hadn't told me, I never would have bought it on my own initiative! - What the heck! - But this morning... Look, do you have a special permission? You are here outside visiting hours. - Am I bothering anyone? - Everybody, this is not visiting time. - Is he a relative of yours? - Of mine? I don't even know him! I was actually going to tell him that this is not visiting time. - Well, what do you want? - I have a message for her! - Mancinelli! - I'm her cousin. - Mancinelli! See him out and find out who let him in or I will hold you accountable for it. What are you doing? You have to leave! Come back in the afternoon, you can't get in now. You better be careful, the nun took it out on me. I told that moron he shouldn't stay too long! Don't you have your keys? - Do you know if...? - Come on in! We already had lunch. - But do you know if...? - Come on! Get in! No, don't even mention it. I told you right away that I should go for blood tests. That's all for the best, then, thank God. Professor, hurry up and eat, you have an errand to run. - But then... - Hurry up, don't make her mad again. - Professor? - Huh? - Are you feeling sick? - Huh? Oh, no, no... - Aren't you going to eat the omelet? - Maybe tonight. Right now... You can do the dishes tonight. - You have to go to via Farini, now. You know where I mean? - Yes. Tell her I'm sending her both girls right away, as soon as they get dressed, but I want them back by dinnertime, because that's when it gets busy here. - Understood? - Yes, I have. I'll go take a nap. You're gonna have to hurry because she needed to know before 2. Don't be late because I'm going for a pedicure at 6 and there's nobody here in case somebody asks for the room. Me too, I want to go for a pedicure, on Monday. - Listen, did you see Lea? - Huh? Oh, yes, I did! What did she want? Nothing, just an errand. I'll tell you tonight. But... where did she go? She didn't... - Excuse me, she didn't... - Surgery A. Thank you, but how... This is just for the admissions, now she's in Surgery A, Giannantonio's ward. Marquise? Marquise? Look at that! Where is everybody else supposed to sit? I'll be darned! So much for good quality socks! Just look at that... - Professor? - Sorry... I'm sorry. I was at via Principe Amedeo's, I don't know if you remember me. I remember. How are you? Well... so-so. - And how are you? - Well... so-so. Does it hurt? She has a splintered fracture, they gave her morphine this morning. Professor? Come here. Sit down. - Listen... - Yes. - Did Lea send you? - She did. I was here this morning but they asked me to leave. And they had given you morphine. Are you better now? - A lot better. - Thank goodness! When I got here, you were crying... But... why? Were you angry? Because Lea said you shouldn't be. - I shouldn't? - No. - Why not? - I'm telling you, you shouldn't. First of all, she had told you right away that you shouldn't have. And now, she's gone because of this big time opportunity she got. She said that when you get discharged there's no point in writing to her, you see? You really want to get angry, then! - Lea said... - Who cares about Lea! I don't care about Lea! It's not for her. Come on, come on! How much she got? Did you hear what the nun said? "Come on, come on!" Just go, Professor. Please, go away! Wail:! - I apologize. - No, it's OK. What for? - I'm sorry, I'm not angry at you. - Thank goodness! Because you know... apparently everything else is my fault. - I did nothing against you! - No. Did you see that? Now, if there's a dent in a bed she might say that a patient did it. - What? - I mean, they often say it's the patients' fault. Oh... that's for sure! Don't make me laugh, it hurts. Get me my purse in the nightstand. This one, that's right. Thanks. When I arrived, there was someone in that bed on the other side, and her hair was dyed just like yours. I thought it was you. - Huh? - What is it? No! I didn't mean to say that you got dyed hair! Professor, I'm going to kill you. Are you checking if someone damaged it? So often, people move your stuff and bruise it, even if it's quality stuff. No, I was just looking at it... It might not even be quality stuff, is it? - You had it for a long time? - No. Often, especially these items they make nowadays you only know when you use them. Lately, I have... - When are you coming to see me again? - Well, I... What? - I asked, when are you coming to see me again? - Oh... yes, of course I am! - I forgot to tell you two things. - Tomorrow? - Yes, but, listen up... Hey! You're still here! You have to leave. - I was telling her... - You can tell her tomorrow, you must leave now. Be good! Be good! Come on, don't start just yet! Can you come with me to Tivoli today? Same place I went the other day. Didn't they tell you they would give you the cab fare? I added the cab fare to the price but since I can go by bus... We need to get on the bus at 4. And we'll be back at... you can wait for me at 7, just like we did before. Then, maybe I should do the dishes right away, so we won't be late. - Aren't you going to see her? - Who? Oh! That's right, I got so busy I almost forgot. - Well, the dishes... - They'll do the dishes. You go see how she's doing and tell her what I told you yesterday. - I'll meet you at the bus, at 4. - Alright, thanks. - Put out that cigarette! - I'm sorry. Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient who was in Giannantonio's Ward. A girl who had shot herself. - The second door to the right. - Thank you. Oh! Good girl! HI. - I brought you some grapes. - Very nice of you, thanks. You remembered to come and see me... Sit down. Why do they keep moving you around all the time? I went back to Giannantonio's Ward. I asked to be moved here because it's more quiet. - Isn't it? - Must be expensive! A little, I won't stay too long. I'll have the stitches removed on Thursday. That's good! So you can go home then! Oh, I'm sorry. - Why? Aren't you going home? - Yes, I am. Oh... sorry. For God's sake, you shouldn't react like this! Poor thing, she's always so depressed... And she really ought to cheer up. That's what I was telling her! I had a handkerchief, where did it go? Take mine, it's clean. Oh... it's got holes in it! Listen up... I'm sorry, but I might forget. - Madam said that... you know who I'm talking about? - Yes. - She told me to ask you to come back with us, when you're out of here. - Oh... - Do you mind? - No, why? And yesterday I forgot to tell you that your friend said that she left her keys in the little drawer and a suitcase that she will send for. Oh, yeah... alright. - Alright. - But I... Do you need me to run some errands for you? What errands? Yesterday, you told me to come back and I thought that... Well... I think I must be... - Why not? Would you get me the latest Mondadori crime story? - Huh? Oh, yeah! When you lived with us you always read Mondadori crime stories. That's good, you remember. Also, half a pound of candies, please. - The jellies! - Yes. But I didn't ask you to come and see me so you could run errands for me. You didn't? Why did you, then? Why? Because. Because I'm lonely. To keep me company. To keep me company because I'm all alone, alright? But... But I... sorry, but... I'm not much of a company, am I? OK then, bye. I'll meet you here in two hours. - I'll go with you. - No, I'm going alone. Bye. - Are we there yet? - Huh? No, we are still in Acque Albule. How boring! Those are called "one hundred little chambers" because there actually were all of those little chambers. They were supposedly meant for servants or served as army barracks. Or maybe they served as storage or something else. Oh, the Greek theater. No, it's the so-called "Greek theater", they don't really know what it was. Well, that's just great! - Want one? - Thanks. Oh, I must remember to buy jellies for Marquise, tomorrow. She said: "Mondadori crime stories and half a pound of jellies. " Good boy! Why do they have to push and shove in hospital hallways! - Oops... I'm sorry. - No harm done. - We're among sick people. - If I'm bothering you, I'll go out. No, not at all, I was on my way out, I have to go train my muscles. - I do it every other day, you know? - Really? - Yes. At Professor Giacobbe's ward, do you know where that is? No, I only know Giannantonio's ward. With all that people pushing and shoving I almost couldn't my way back here. Muscle training has always been at Giacobbe's ward. At Giannantonio's ward there's Professor Giannantonio. - No, I meant that... - But, Professor! - If you'll excuse me. - Sure, no problem. HI. - Sorry, but... - Sit here. I'm sorry but she... Listen to me. I'm sorry, she felt like chatting. And, since she was talking about this Giacobbe's ward, I wanted to explain. I know you were explaining her but why don't you explain it to me? - What? - Whatever you like! Since you're here to visit me, explain it to me, alright? - How so "you can reach it"? - How you can reach it? I told you, walking along the big retaining wall. No, I mean, why do you say "you can reach it"? Oh... because that's what it says. It says: "You can reach it walking along the big retaining wall. " And, in fact, I did walk along the big wall and I got there. I think you're taking me for a ride. - Are you? - What? Not at all. - Do you want a candy? - No, thanks. I don't, thanks. Since it describes the whole route and it's very well explained, I was telling you how the booklet tells you to get there. But who knows what it was! Apparently, they don't even know. Really? And how is that? They don't know, they don't have to know! Somebody might say: "What are they digging for?". No, I wasn't going to say that... No, but even Gina said: "What are they digging for?". Oh, Gina... But who would expect Gina to understand! Go take a look in the hallway and see what the nun is doing, I want to smoke. She is sitting down the hallway. You want to smoke? You're not allowed. Then you won't smoke now, you'll smoke later. If the nun gets here while I'm smoking tell her you were smoking. - Alright, but won't it harm you? - Not at all! Actually, Gina told me right away that she couldn't understand the booklet. - She says hi. - Oh, thanks. Is something the matter with you? Who, me? What's the matter with me? Nothing, why? At first, you were looking at me, now you don't. Oh, no... I was looking at my socks. - Do I always have to look at you? - Of course. - That's enough, you smoke now. - The nun was here? I don't know, do you think she was? - What? - No, sorry, I was joking. What were you saying about your socks? - I said that... What time is it? - It's still early. Why? You got to go? Not right away, but later I have to go in via Cernaia. He wanted to know if I could go today. I asked because maybe it was past visiting hours. In this ward there is no visiting time. That's good, so the nuns won't start yelling at me. Why don't you tell me about this academy? What academy? Oh, yeah... But that's all I've talked about! That's not true, you only told me that you get there walking along the big retaining wall. Oh, that's right, but... See? I didn't even remember about this. - Why? - It doesn't say: "Along the big retaining wall. " It says: "Though a short ramp beneath cypress and olive trees. " You don't have to tell me what the booklet says if you don't recall. - How did you get there? - How could I remember? - Excuse me. - No problem. You're done with your training? Yes, the nurse made me laugh so hard because the Professor wasn't there and neither was his assistant... Oh, well, you can tell me later. Yes, of course. It was really hilarious. What are you looking at? No... I was just thinking that sometimes they don't even know if something was there before or if it was made afterward. For instance, in this academy there's a building that's still standing and there's a flock of sheep now. Then, there is another building in ruins and I sat on them. So you start thinking: "Maybe this one was built before. " - They don't know. - But what about the sheep? There was nobody there. What do you mean "the sheep"? You said there were sheep inside the other building. Nobody took care of them? - The dogs were there. Why? What's this got to do with anything? - No, nothing. You started talking about the sheep, that's why I asked, OK? I wasn't talking about the sheep. I was saying that since sometimes you can't trace back a building even its identification will be arbitrary. I understand that but since you said that... You're such a bore! Most of the time they don't leave them all in one place and whoever takes care of them can't be around, so they are left with the dogs. I know because even in Maglianello, in the province of Rieti... - Wait, wait, let me... - Thank you, you're very kind. - You'll be more comfortable, this way. - Thank you. - So, you're from Rieti. - From the province of Rieti. But now I live in Rome, I work at my brother-in-law's company. - Are you both from Rome? - Yes... or maybe not. - The Professor here says that you can't always tell. - Oh... Ouch! It still hurts a little, not too much. - Would you like a candy? - Thank you, very kind of you. Thank you. - If every time you reach for something... - Yes? If you stretch out to get things and twist your chest, it's going to hurt! Next time, I'll get you some unwrapped candies. You don't need the wrapping. They're worth the same money and if you buy the ones with the wrapping the weight turns all to the retailer's advantage. You're making me swallow the wrong way! Professor, you're so dumb! Why do you always have to say this kind of silliness? "The retailer. " No? But why? Don't you call it a retailer? No, yes... well, whatever. Anyway, I'll buy them unwrapped. I must go now, I have to do that stuff! told you about. Too bad you have to leave! Will you be back tomorrow? Of course he will, I'm getting up tomorrow and he's got to help me. Oh, good girl! Then, Professor Giacobbe will have you on your feet, too? I don't know his name. He really must be on his way now, or he'll be late. Could you leave the room for a moment, please? We'd like to say good-bye. Of course, I'll leave right away. Why didn't you shave today? I didn't have time. What's it to you, anyway? I worry about arbitrary identifications. Otherwise, I couldn't care less. Hello? Yes? She doesn't live here anymore. She said you can write to the the general delivery of Viale Mazzini Yes. You're welcome. I'll rush but I'm not sure I can make it by 4. You'll have to go by yourselves. I'll meet you there you so we can ride together on the 7 o'clock bus, alright? - You're working Sundays too, now? - How about you? It's even better on Sundays, there's not a lot of traffic. Bye, I must run. - Do you know the time? - It's 6:15. You still have 45 minutes. Have you seen the museum? - No, what's it like? - Come, I'll show you. - So? - What? Oh, yeah. Thanks. - Want one? - Huh? No. - What are you thinking about? - What I'm thinking? Who knows! I don't know! What are you looking at? I'm not supposed to know either? Huh? Oh, yeah... Actually, no, nothing. Wanna go see a movie? We'll send Gina home and go to a movie theater. - OK? - Yeah... whatever. You're so fussy! - Gina? Gina! - Huh? Are we in Acque Albule? No, we're almost there but we're getting off here because he has to take me someplace. - Oh, but... - Bye, we'll see you at home. Come on! This way, we'll go back to San Lorenzo Where are we going? Didn't you want to go to the movies? I want to go wherever you like, wherever you like! Where do I want to go? I want to go wherever you like! It still hurts a little bit. Feel it, it's here. I'm sorry, I hurt you. You hurt me when you were sulking, but after that you didn't. I'm sorry, it's just that... Because... what am I supposed to do? Yes, I know... I didn't mean to... - It was just that... - I know... I know. Give a nice smile to this young lady now, alright?
