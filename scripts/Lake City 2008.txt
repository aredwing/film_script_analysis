Tom. Tommy Wills. How are you? I'm good. Oh, gosh, it's good to see you. What brings you to town? I'm just visiting my folks for a few days. Hi, there. Hey. Mrs. Pope, I want to introduce you to my wife. This is Linda. Hi. - Maggie. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Congratulations. I heard about the wedding. Oh, thank you. So how do you all know each other? Well-- Um, Tom knew my son. Oh, do I know him? No. Help me! Help me. Stay back. Stay back. Give her space. Watch her head. Someone, call 911. Hold her head up. Hold her head. Call 911 now! It's okay; hold her head up. Yes, we need an ambulance at Glen Owl Market. There's a girl having a seizure. Okay. All right. There she goes. Just take deep breaths. Honey, you're doing just fine. Are they coming? They're on their way. She got in here before I had a chance to see what they dropped off. I'm going to find Hope. I don't know where the hell she is, but I'm gonna find her, I swear to you. Let's try this one more time. Where is she? I don't know where Hope is. Come on, Red. It's me. I told you everything I know. Okay, Carl, untie him. Let the man have a drink. Thank you. Can I have a smoke? Well, I don't see why not. Okay, tough guy. Where is she? Baby sister, There's never going to be a better time to sell. I don't want to sell. Look, there's a window of opportunity right now. It's my home. I raised my family there. John Stanton at the bank says that that road is going to come through. And he's got a developer who will pay us cash tomorrow if we sell together. I don't know why we're talking about this again. You do what you want with your part. Mary Margaret, make sense. I mean, that development's going to happen whether we like it or not. I am going to sell my half. But we can get triple if we both sell. Is this what you want or what Nancy Kaye wants? It's what we both want. Look, I'm just trying to do what's best for you, what's best for all of us. Think about moving where me and Nancy Kaye live. I mean, there's a great subdivision. Got three-bedroom houses with central air and a pool. It's manageable, honey. And you might meet somebody. How long's it been since you danced? Do you remember when you loved to dance? I don't want to sell, George. Hoo-hoo! Look who's here. Howdy hi. The prices down here are so cheap. You two got finished with your little talk? I don't like getting involved in discussions involving money. I don't have a head for finances, do I, Georgie? Oh, Maggie, you look tired. You know what you need? Let me see. A manicure. Oh, yeah, brighten up your day. Hey, you know what? We got to get going if we're going to get to clogging tonight. We got to practice. These trophies just don't win themselves, you know. Well, come on. Up and at 'em. Think about it, pumpkin. I'm just thinking about your interest. You know, we really ought to do these little lunches more than once every couple months. Really. Come on, Georgie. Bye-bye. Good-bye. Hope! My mom says I have to go with you. Come on; we got to go now. Let's go! What happened to your face? Where are we going? ...in Memphis, Tennessee, home of the cave. Why are we stopping? Hang on, kid. Wake up. I'm hungry. Hey, it's Hope. Leave a message. Beep! Where are you? What the fuck are you doing? You're doin' it. What the fuck are you doing? Give me that. No! Give that to me! - No! God damn it. Shit. Pretend like you're sick. I think I am. License and registration, please. Just a sec, Officer. You must be in one hell of a rush. Kid's sick. I got to get him to a doctor. What happened to your face? Well, it's-- It's a long story... Jennifer. Hi, Billy. - Hi. Nice uniform. What brings you home? Just need a little vacation. You still in Detroit? No, Memphis. Wow. Just playing with my band. How's that going? It's going good. It's great. Who's your friend? This is Clayton. I know his mom. I'm keeping him for a while. Hi, Clayton. Hi. How long you around? Oh, couple days. How you been? Good. Well, I guess I ought to let you go. Clayton, tell this guy if he doesn't stop speeding, he's going to have to let you do the driving from now on. Maybe I'll see you while I'm here. Yeah, maybe. What's wrong with you? I said, "act sick." You sounded like you were having a baby. Filter for your tractor. Oh, thanks, Roy. Could you check my oil? The engine's been running a little hot lately. You bet. Want to pop the hood? Oh. I'm going to get a coke. You want one? No, thanks. Do I need any? Uh, no. It's good. Thanks, Roy. Put it on my bill. Okay. Yoo-hoo! Billy? Hey. I was watching that. Billy? Billy, what are you doing here? Why didn't you tell me you were coming? Hi, Mom. Who's that little boy in the living room? Got any of that pimento cheese you used to make? No, I don't make it anymore. You were the only one who ate it. If I'd known you were coming, I could have made some. Billy, who is that boy? That's Clayton. I'm keeping him for a while. That doesn't really answer my question. What happened to the cedar tree out front? It was struck by lightning. Billy. What is with you? Will you look at me? What happened? Nothing. I'm just trying to make a sandwich. I'm starving. Excuse me. I haven't heard from you in over a year, and you show up with a banged-up face and a kid, and I'm not supposed to ask any questions? Sorry to inconvenience you. I just need a place to stay for a couple days. Is that okay? This is your home too. It always has been. Better put something on that. She said I was supposed to wake you up for supper. Are you going someplace? Yeah, I got to go out. I got stuff to do. Billy. Can you watch the kid? Sure. Thank you. I'll be back later. You can stay in here. I'll be downstairs if you need me. ...thanks to surgery at the hospital for sick children. Your TV sucks. Then why are you watching it? There's nothing else to do. Why don't you read a book? Don't have one. It's been a long time coming. I'm determined, more than ever this time. And I know it won't be easy, but I have a baby now. And... I got to do it. I'm Tanya, and I'm an alcoholic. Thanks for sharing, Tanya. Is there anyone else who'd like to share? No, I'll pass. Okay, then. Well, let's join hands. Whose father? Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. How often you go? Not so much anymore. First year, I went religiously. Now I just go when I need to. Yeah, me too. What happened to New York? I thought you were going to be on Broadway. Yeah, so did I. I went. I waitressed for two years before my dad got sick. None of my brothers were around anymore, so I came home to take care of him. That was ten years ago. You ever wish you'd gone back? Not really. I'm good at what I do, and I like it here, so... How long you been sober? A long time. Wasn't so much I had a problem, you know. It was more about where I was headed. You know how it is. Yeah, I do know how it is. How long you really been sober? Billy! Hey, man, is that you? Rick? Hey, hey, rock star! Hey, man. How you been doing? Sorry, man. I haven't seen you since forever. I know. How's Donny? He died. What? Yeah, you didn't hear? He died, man. Drove his truck off a bridge. Man, he was wasted. Oh, my God. - Yeah. That must have wrecked Shelly. Oh, man, it was brutal. I mean, she got two kids, and one of 'em is his, So, you know, it's rough, man. Hey, you want to--you want to go grab a drink? You want to get a beer or something, man? Man, I can't. Maybe later. Oh, I got you. Police business, huh? See you, Billy. Always nice to see you outside the squad car, Rick. What time is it? It's late. Where've you been? I had some things I needed to take care of. You smell like a bar. He's not A stray dog, Billy. What? He's not one of those strays you used to bring home. What are you talking about? The ones that I ended up taking care of. Turn out the lights before you come up. Billy, where are you? I'm in my mom's house. Look, Beth, I just need to know if you've heard anything from Hope. I haven't heard anything since she blew out of here. Well, do you have any idea where she could be? I have no idea. I thought she was with you. She never checked in. I mean, if I don't hear from her in the next couple of days, then maybe I'll just-- I don't know--go back there. You can't come back. Red's been asking a lot of questions. He's going to fucking kill you. Hold on a second. Could you stop? Do something else? Bzzz? What kind of questions? Where you are, where Hope is. Billy, I don't want to be involved. Last night, Leo called, and Red had me lie for him and say he wasn't there. Uh, yeah, I get it. I get it. Um, well, that's great. What are the dates, again? Billy? Yeah, no, I'm available, sure. Billy? Shit, I need the work. Is Clayton with you? Okay, well, great. I understand. Listen to me-- Well, thank you. I'll see you then. Okay, thank you. - Billy! Fucking idiot. I'll be back before supper. Okay. Clayton? Run and get a clean shirt. You don't have one? Mm-mm. I saw you had a bag. Don't you have any clothes in it? No. Do you have a toothbrush? Mm-mm. Might help if you use this. What's in there? We don't go in there. If you know how to fix a tractor, I could sure use some help. Hi. What are you doing here? Just thought I'd stop by and say hi. Okay. So what's wrong? I need to find someone. Who are you looking for? The kid I'm with, I need to find his mother. Well, have you tried her friends, family? No one knows where she is. Does she have a husband or a boyfriend? What about the boy's father? Why doesn't Billy look like you? 'cause he looks like his father. Why did you name him Billy? 'Cause his father's name was that and his father before him. Hey, could you get the jumper cables? Sure. Where are they? Oh, they died a long time ago. My mom goes to work every day. Where does she work? Hooters. Oh! She's a dancer. Is that right? Mm-hmm. Okay, now, take this cable, and put it right in there. Attaboy. Haven't seen one of these in a while. '68? That's right. What can I do for you? Brakes keep on slipping. Let's have a look. Boy, she's walked a mile. She still plays good. I'm kind of partial to her. You're Maggie pope's boy, aren't you? You know my mom? I'm Roy Long. Billy. Yeah, I got some buddies I play with. We're not very good, but we have fun. Car's ready. Just needed some fluid. What do I owe you? Just brake fluid. Five bucks ought to cover it. Come back on Sunday, 2:00. We can always use another player. Hop in the truck, Clayton. I'll be right back. Get out of the back, Clayton. Get out of the back! Why? Thud! Come on. Come on. Come on. Get out. Because I said so; that's why. Get out! - I can do it myself. I'm sorry, Clayton. What are you doing in here? Nothin'. Is that your shirt? No. Where'd you get it? Maggie gave it to me. Soup's on. Did you wash your hands? Yeah. With soap? Mm-hmm. Let me see. Scoot. What are you laughing at? Go wash. "Scoot. Wash your hands." Wash your hands. I'm washing 'em. If she asks you if you washed your hands from now on, you just say, "yes." Stop hogging the water. Relax. Oh, wait. Here. Here. Okay? Hold on. Here. Let me see. Other side. He's yours, isn't he? Does he know? I don't think so. Why didn't you tell me? I just found out just a couple days ago. His mother's got some problems that she needs to figure out. So I'm a grandmother. Clayton? Is that-- Clayton! Where have you been? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Hope, calm down. What the fuck are you looking at? What is she looking at? Oh, no. Where is my son, huh? Clayton! Where have you been? How'd you even find me? Beth told me. Could you have made it any fucking harder, out here in the middle of nowhere? Made it any harder? You disappeared! I've been calling you. Clayton? Where is he? Hope, look, we got to talk, okay? I'm calling the police! Look, Mom. Please, wait. Mom, wait. - Clayton! I'm calling the police. Mom, hang up the phone. Mom! Mom! Clayton. Oh, baby. Oh, oh. Did you do what mama told you to do? Yes, Mama. You're a good boy, baby. Good boy. Come on, baby. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. You ain't taking him. Let go of him! Let go! You're high! You're totally fucking high! You ain't taking him anywhere. Oh, shit. Okay. Jesus fucking Christ, Hope. Baby, listen. Mama's going to come back for you, okay, okay? I got to take care of a couple things. All right? No, no, no, you ain't going nowhere. Mom! Get off me! Hold on a second. You understand what you've done? You're not leaving with that. Let go of me! I can't let you leave with that shit. Stop it! Give me the bag! Don't worry about Red, okay? I got it all figured out. Okay? Jesus Christ, Hope. Mom! Mom! Hey, Mom, don't leave me! Mom! Hey, it's Hope. Leave a message. Beep! Billy? What? Where are you going? I'm going to find Clayton's mother. And what are you going to do with him? I don't know. I'll figure it out. Oh, and that's your rock-solid plan? Fine; I'll take him with me. Oh, and then what? Give him back to the woman Who came to pick up drugs from her kid? There was a mountain of drugs on my floor, Billy. They weren't mine. You could go to jail. I said that they weren't mine! If this is the way it's going to be with you home, I'd rather you not be here at all. I won't go through this again! Fine. You won't have to. Hey, man. Rick. How you doing? Good. Good. Can I buy you a beer? It's kind of early. Oh, hell, man. Beer don't know what time it is. Loretta, can we get two more? Good to see you. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hey. It's been too long. Maybe some other time, Rick. Frank, play something. Sounds good. Okay. Hey. Come on in. Sit down. Grab a guitar, if you feel like it. Okay. # come with me. # # come with me. # # let me take you away # # from the madness you see. # # come with me. # # let me show you a place # # where your heart can run free # # if you come with me. # # baby, come with me. # I thought you were asleep. You hungry? Little bit. I can make you some eggs. Earlier when I said I-- I--I didn't-- I didn't mean that. Those weren't my drugs. Whose were they? They were Red's. He's a dealer. Hope took them from him, and he thinks I'm in on it. Are you? No. Is he dangerous? Not as dangerous as the people he works for. Billy. How did you get mixed up with these people? How are you? I don't know anything! Stop! I'll fucking kill you. Where are they? I--I don't know. Where'd you get that hat? Take it off. What? I said take it off. You can't make me. Take it off. If I tell you to-- Asshole. What are you doing? It's what I do when I'm trying to sort things out. Want to try it? You done? Now what? Now you just think about it. Nothing's happening. Shh. You have to be patient. Now just let it go. That's all? That's all. Nice family. Which one's Billy? Who are you? I'm a friend. He's not here. Yes, he is. Your mother's a very attractive lady. I saw the-- I saw the boy. Where's Hope? She took off. She left him with me. Look, I don't know where Hope is, so what do you want from me? I want you to find her so things don't have to get ugly. He said he doesn't know. Ma'am, I can think of a hundred thousand reasons that he should find out. You got one day. I'm going to get you your stuff back, I swear. If you don't... I will be the least of your problems. Have a nice day, ma'am. It's a nice place you got here. I'm at the Red Roof. Mom. Mom. Hey. Hey. Where is she? Sit down, Billy. I have some bad news. Is this her car? Is she dead? She suffer? She died on impact. I don't think she felt anything. I'm so sorry, Billy. What are you doing? Building a house. Who's Andy? He's my other son. Where's he? He died. How? An accident. Have you ever been to Mexico? I haven't. My mom and I are moving there. That sounds like an adventure. I bet it's beautiful there. Gonna live on the ocean, go scuba diving every day. Oh, Clayton, they don't fit that way. This is not the way it works. You're not supposed to mix them. Why not? Well, it just doesn't work that way. See? Works all sorts of ways. I'll just put this here. I guess it does. What are you looking for? Oh! You scared the hell out of me. It's not there, Billy. It's been confiscated. You think those are my drugs? Were they? No. - Come on, Billy. Well, arrest me, then. Looking at me like that. Come on, Jennifer; arrest me, then. Fuck. Well, look what the cat drug in. Can I ask you a question? Shoot. You got kids? Four of 'em. Where are they? All over. Talk to 'em? They don't talk to me. Hell, I don't blame them. Time was, I wouldn't talk to me either. How's your mom? She's fine. She seeing anybody? My mother? I'm not sure. Well, I got to make a run to the parts store. I'm not very good at this kind of thing. Never really taken it seriously before. Well, I thought you all were just crazy. But truth is, you just-- You're asking me to do something I don't want to do, and that's to look at myself. And, well, I'm just afraid of that truth. So... I don't want to look at it. I lie to people, and I run. As far as I run, as fast as I go, I end up staying in the same place. Anyway, my name's Billy, and this is my second meeting. Thank you for letting me share. All right, Clayton. I'll be right back. Oh, excuse me! Hi. - Hi, Roy. Beautiful day, huh? Yes. He--he spent the night at the station. What? Billy. After his AA meeting. Oh. Guess he just needed a place to crash. I figured you'd want to know he was okay. Well, thank you for looking out for him. He's come by, you know, played with us. He's good. Taught us old boys a few tricks. Well, I expect you've got things to do. Maybe you'd like to come by sometime, hear us play. I'd like that. Good to see you. Yeah. Hi. Here. Thanks. You want some sugar? Sure. I know you think I'm a fuck-up. And maybe I am. Hope's gone. I got this kid, and I don't know how I'm going to tell him that she's not coming back. I don't think you're a fuck-up. Hey, Jennifer. Hey, boys, Jennifer! Get in the truck! You can talk about it if you want to. I was there too, you know. It's been a pleasure. Thank you. Clayton? Clayton, lock the doors. I'll be right back. Click! For me? Yes, it's for you. Try not to drip. I'm coming. Hold on a second. Well, well, well. Come on in. Come on. The thing is-- The thing is, I don't have your money. Red, I don't have the drugs, 'cause-- 'cause Hope's dead. She drove off the road. The police found the wreck and took everything that was inside the car, so... Yeah, that's a surprise. I don't have anything for you. I got a little bit of money in the bank and my car. It's not much, but it's all I have. If that's not enough, then I guess you can just do whatever you want to me. That's for my face. That's for my drugs. That was for fun. You need to rethink this martyr thing. It's all taken care of. Get out of here. Before I fucking kill you, get the fuck out of here. I got some celebrating to do. Ready? Split! I think that's mine. No way. Fine; take it. I'm going to read my book. What's wrong with him? He thought you weren't coming back. What am I supposed to tell him, Billy, when you disappear like that? Why did you sell this place? It was time. It was my hat that day. What? It was-- It was my hat that day. Oh, stop it. No. It was my hat, and all these years, I've been blaming you. Billy-- I've been so mad at you. Stop it! No, I can't stop, Mom, because I need to talk to you, and I need you to talk to me about this. I don't want to talk about it! I've been so mad at you. Stop it. No, I can't! I don't want to talk about this! But it was my fault! It was my fault! I did it! One of the drivers didn't show. Look, we're behind schedule, So I'm going to the next field. I'll drive. Hey, boys, Jennifer, get in the truck! Mom, my hat! Stop! Hey! Not a day goes by I don't think about that day and how I could have changed it. Oh, if I just-- Not a single day. It doesn't matter whose hat it was. You were just a little boy who had to grow up in a day. And I wasn't much good at helping you. I'm sorry... For everything. But we have to stop now. I'm so tired. Me too. I can live with it now... Not having Andy. What I can't live with is not having you. Mom. You think Andy's up there somewhere? I don't know. What are you going to tell him? Got to figure that out. I'm his dad. Wait a second. Jeez, man. I'm just getting up. Hey, Jesus Christ. Leo. I was coming to see you tonight. Hey, guys. You been hard to get a hold of. Yeah, well, things kind of got off track, but, um, I got-- I got your money. That's right. This is it? Yeah, of course. It's, like, twice what the coke would have been worth. Coke? Half of that shipment was heroin. Didn't you even look, huh? You fucking idiot! Didn't you even look? Come here; give me your fucking balls. Where's my shit? Where's my fucking shit? What do you got there? I haven't seen these in years. Check this out. They bobble-wobble, but they don't fall down. Great. Hey. I'm sorry for being a jerk the other day. I'm sorry that I've been gone a lot. There's been a lot going on. What would you say if I told you that I was your dad? So? Right. Not sure I'd want me for a dad either. I need to talk to you about your mom. Your mom loved you, Clayton. She loved you more than anyone else in the whole world. What do you mean? She, um... She was in an accident. She died. No. You're a liar. No, it's true. No! You're a fucking liar! Clayton. Fill it up. Yes, sir. Didn't I see you come through here the other day, asking directions? No, that must have been somebody else. Ah. I'll talk to him. Nah, I should go. Let me try. She's coming back. She always does. I'm sorry, Clayton. I know this is hard to hear. No! She's coming back. She'll come back for this. Oh, my God. Clayton. No, listen to me. She'll come back for this. Wait here. For fuck's sake, don't fuck around. If you've got any of it, you got to give it to 'em. Red, I swear to you, man-- Don't fuck around! This is deep shit! You're in a whole lot of fucking trouble here! What was that? Shh. Pete. Run to the woods. Hide in the woods. No. - Go, go. Go! Go! Whoo! Over here! Whoo! Get in. Over here! Over he-- Mom! Mom! Where's Clayton? He's in the woods. I'm okay. I'm okay. Okay. Okay, let's do it. What are they doing? He's terrorizing a lizard. Don't forget to call me before you start back. Yes, Mom. Don't let the kid give you too much trouble. He won't. Here it is. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it! I used to get so melancholy this time of year. It's kind of sad, the change of seasons. Remember those big parties we used to have out here? Yeah. It's just a dry patch of dirt now. It was just a dry patch of dirt then.
