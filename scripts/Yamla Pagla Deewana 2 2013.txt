Oh, my God! - How did that happen! How did that car start?! Only God knows! Anyway, thanks. - It's alright. Bye. Jealous, huh? Mr. Johal! Thank God I'm on time! Why did you jump? Why did you save me? My wife ran away with my best friend. My best friend was my ad agency's creative director. He took my wife as well as my business! I'm fcc d! Oh God! Mr. Johal. Death isn't the solution. Staying alive won't help either. Tomorrow I've to pitch an ad campaign to a renowned company. It was my last chance. I'm finished. And on top of that you are here for the loan's recovery. I don't want to be alive. I want to... What's the product? Are you ready, Paramveer? - Yes. Yes. Roll sound. Roll camera. Action. D'ole energy drink. Lift 2.5 tons with ease. My dear devotees... Nutty, Looney, Crazy... This mantra was generated by my soul. Nutty, who has surrendered himself to the Lord. Looney, a wanderer, distanced from the attractions of this world... ...immersed in the Lord's devotion. Crazy, someone who loves the Lord so much... ...that even the Lord becomes his disciple. If this great mantra has touched your soul... ...then accept this mantra into your life. And sing this from your heart... Nutty, Looney, Crazy... Nutty, Looney, Crazy... - Nutty, Looney, Crazy... Come to me. Come to me. - Oh, noble sage... Please save me. Please save me. I can feel your pain, my son. Get rid of the burden you have on your body and soul. Give it up. Let go of it. Let go. Why are you staring at me? Throw your chain, watch and otherjewelry. Yes. Nutty! Looney! Oh, my God! What is he doing? Crazy! Nutty, Looney, Crazy! I feel light, sage. I feel light. Long live, Sage Nutty! Long live, Sage Nutty! Long live. - Long live, Sage Nutty! Ready? We are going to get lots of things today. - Yes. Long live, Sage Nutty! Long live, Sage Nutty! Long live, Sage Nutty! Long live, Sage Nutty! Long live, Sage Nutty! Long live, Sage Nutty! Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Long live, Sage Nutty! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, noble sage! Get up. Get up, my devotee. Who are you, my child? I'm Sir Yograj Khanna. I've come from England. Show me your right hand. Now show me your left hand. What's the time? I can see it. I can see it. I saw it. Wealth, the one who has it is sad. And the one who doesn't have it is also sad. Right. Absolutely right. You know it all. Don't worry. Soon, a noble soul will enter your life. He'll rid you off all your worries. Oh, noble sage! Brother Gajodhar... I've already sold this one. Hey, the bullet holes I'll put in you will confuse you... ...as from where to breathe and from where to... Got it? Hey, you 'Dabang' thief! Give my Salman back to me! It was yours. But now it's mine. Stop. I've watched 'Dabang' 70 times. And I've watched it 170 times. I've watched 'Hum Apke Hain Kaun' 200 times. And I've watched it 250 times. Stop! I've watched 'Maine Pyar Kiya' 300 times. There's a reason why my name is Suman. And I've watched it a 1000 times. That's why everyone affectionately calls me Prem. I can give up my life but not Salman. Hey... I'll kill you! Hey! Stop! Stop! I won't spare you! My trident! Ma'am, you shouldn't be so angry with your husband. He isn't my husband. Here, only wives make their husband run on the streets. Stay happily married. Hello, Mr. Jindal. Hi, Paramveer. How are you doing? - Great. Please. Harry Johal has started paying the installments. Your energy drink is causing wonders. Thank you, sir. God knows how you do it. He knows. Now, I've another assignment for you. Tell me, what do I have to lift now? One of our bank's oldest clients. A few years ago I sanctioned a loan of 10 million pounds to him. But all of a sudden he has stopped paying the installments. Which is very unlike him. And it has the bank worried. You go and find out in your own style as to what his problem is. And see if you can help recover the loan. Sir, Mr. Dharam Oberoi... ...is the owner of Oberoi, Oberoi and Oberoi group of industries. He's one of the top shots of this country. Wow. All his royal guests come in this car. If someone pleases him, he gifts him a palace. Mr. Oberoi, how did you and your mistress... ...manage to do all this without breaking any bones? Very funny. But if this is uploaded on YouTube... And if your wife sees it, then it's not funny. No! Don't do that. My wife will disown me if she finds out about this. I'm ready to do anything. - Anything, huh? Look at this place. This palace can belong to you. Oberoi greetings. Oh my God. Oberoi greetings. Oberoi greetings. Greetings. Delighted to meet you, Mr. Oberoi. Sir Yograj Khanna. We have met thanks to the great Sage Nutty. The one who gets his blessings... ...ls blessed for life. Open your eyes and come inside. Oh, I am. Oh, thank you very much. Alright, Mr. Oberoi, I would like to know... ...what has been your financial strategy... ...during the worldwide recession. Strategy? Such an easy question! Even my butler can answer that. Pappu... Mr. Oberoi has invested in inexpensive stocks... ...keeping in mind the capital market equation of this country. He looks at the internal rate of return, sensitivity, volatility... ...because he formally believes Warren-Buffett school of management. Pappu cleared the test? Yes. From where? London school of economics. Wow. And Suzanne, hear from where she graduated as well. Paris school of fashion. Paris! Oui, madame. Suzy, iron my suit. - Yes, sir. Pappu charge my computer.

I've a guest today. Mr. Oberoi, it's alright. Okay. Please carry on. However, I would like to take your leave now. My daughter is waiting for me. Oh. As you please. Thank you so much. If both of you could make it to my hotel tomorrow for breakfast... I would really be very-very honored. I don't think I can make it tomorrow. I've a lot of appointments scheduled for tomorrow. Oh, Mr. Oberoi, please. We will try. - Oh, thank you very much. Oberoi greetings. - Oberoi greetings. Thank you very much. Prince Gajodhar... - Yes, King Dharam... Warm up.

That's it, thank you. So, my child, enjoying? Yeah, it's nice. Gajodhar, somehow, anyhow trap her. This lottery... Is very beautiful. What do you say? Where did he go? I wish your son could have accompanied you. He had a very important appointment to keep. Work is worship for Prem. Prem! Nice name! My name is Prem. Prem! She seems to be a huge fan of Salman. Yes, uncle. Hello? Yes, son. Everyone is missing you. Dharam, I fought with that witch yesterday. But why? We had a scene because of Salman's photo. Salman, Salim... They are like families. It's a small issue. Sort it out. But we should lock this deal at any cost. It's the question of our prestige. But what will I do now? Change your strategy, son. The 70s' formula. Dharam, you are a scoundrel of the worst kind. Perfect shot. You've hit bang on target! Take this, sweetheart. She's hot! I can see that. In life, never underestimate three people... Chulbul Pandey, Tiger and... Prem Oberoi. Who's Prem Oberoi? I am Prem Oberoi. Wow. Over here! - Over here! - Over here! Me! Me! Move! Move! What are you doing? She's good, she's wise!

I've her photo hanging on the wall of my heart! You look like my dream girl, beautiful. I want to make you mine! In your love, I stay busy! This work is difficult, it's not easy! In your love, I stay busy! This work is difficult, it's not easy! I fell in love. I fell so hard. You gave me a sign. And I crossed all lines. I fell in love. I fell so hard. You gave me a sign. And I crossed all lines. I spend sleepless nights. And from this restlessness there is no respite. In your love, I stay busy! This work is difficult, it's not easy! In your love, I stay busy! This work is difficult, it's not easy! In your love, I stay busy! This work is difficult, it's not easy! To you... To you... To you... Did you hear the To you... song? What? - To you... A sign of true love. Yes, I heard! I heard. I love you, Prem. Huh? Oh. Suman, Prem. Prem, Suman. Oh, it looks like the movie 'Maine Pyar Kiya' has begun. We are in this together. Sage Nutty's screenplay was a success. Khanna is so happy he is going Nutty, Looney and Crazy! He says he'll get his daughter engaged to Gajodhar in UK. Now I'll go and swindle people where I was born. We dream of... - Money! Money! Paramveer is calling! All set? Yes. Hi, Paramveer. - Hi. No Sikh is as handsome as my son. So true. - How are you, son? I'm absolutely fine, dad. How are you? - Absolutely fine. Fooling around. He means his florist business is doing well. Brother, is my order ready? Bouquet. Give him a bouquet. - Yes. Here you go. - 500? Fine. It feels so nice to see you both work so hard. You were right, brother. One might not make a lot of money working hard... ...but he surely gets a lot of peace of mind. But, son, there's something that hurts me a lot. You send us half of your salary every month. It's my duty, dad. I don't want you to start swindling again for the need of money. Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! I won't be able to do that anymore. Son, wipe your face. Param, we want to go on a pilgrimage. On a pilgrimage? But you guys are already in Banaras. Everyone goes to Banaras for a pilgrimage and... Brother, the thing is... We have committed so many sins... That if we take a dip in the Ganges... Then it won't be able to wash anyone else's sins. That's why we want to go somewhere far away. Fine, dad. I'll send some money. Bless you, son. Bless you. Oh yes, Param... We might face a network problem over there. Yes. - Hence don't get worried. Okay? - Okay, dad. But call me as soon as you return. Yes. Yes, of course. - Bye, dad. Bye. Love you, son. - Bye. Love you. Poor guy. Dharam, you are a... Scoundrel. Thank you, God. Both of them have mended their ways.

The world's first gravity defying, rotating mall. A mall so big that people will travel in small space capsules. What an idea, Dude-G! That's because Dude is a genius. But remember, this mall won't be just a mall... It will be the 8th wonder of this world. The 8th wonder of this world. Making which Dude will be... - A part of history.

Now Robin is no more, what remains is just the hood. When he was alive no one would dare to come here. Thank you very much for saving all of us. Thank you. It feels as if my elder brother has returned. He's come back. Oh, Paramveer! Okay! Okay! Now Dude is pissed! Really, really pissed! Bunty, Babli, how many guys where there? Just one Singh. Jaswant Singh? So his name is Jaswant Singh? No! Just one Singh. One Sikh gentleman. One Sikh gentleman? Okay. So whom does he work for? For Lord. What?

K... Complete it. Complete it. What are you trying to say? Kartar! - Kartar! Yeah. Now it's better. - Phone. Yes. How's it going, Paramveer? Great, sir. Mr. Khanna has offered me ajob to be his manager. You surely must've worked your wonders there as well. So, when's the check coming in? This time it will take some time for the check to come. That's fine by me. As long as it comes in. Better late than never. All the best. - Okay. Bye-bye. Param, in life, I've seen many millionaires and billionaires. But I've seen no one like the Oberois. They have wealth, but they have intellect as well. Even their servants have studied in London school of economics. Really? - Yeah. But now they will realize how smart and intelligent my club's manager is. ...and intelligent my club's manager is. Thank you, sir. I'll try my best to impress them. Nutty, Looney, Crazy! Param! Hi. Thank you. Quiet! Quiet! Param, come over here! Come over here! Come, my boy. Come. Oberois. Oberoi. Oberoi greetings. Oberoi greetings. Oberoi greetings. - Oberoi greetings. Mr. Dharam Oberoi. Owner of Oberoi, Oberoi and Oberoi group of Industries. Oberoi greetings, Prem Oberoi. Only two Oberois? Where's the third one? Oh, the lucky Oberoi? He's far away, yet very close to us. He loves us a lot. He can face a lot of trouble... ...but can never see us in trouble. But you shouldn't trust anyone so much, especially nowadays. Trust? We trust him. You don't know him... Mr. Paramveer Singh Dhillon. My club's manager. And he's a topper from the university of Leicester. He's very smart and intelligent. You can ask him any intelligent question. Please go ahead.

He'll feel bad if we'll stay in a hotel. And like you, he too is Sage Nutty's devotee. His house is small but his heart is very big. Such a great thought. The car is here. I'll drop you there. Mr. Khanna, I'd like to talk to you for a minute. Okay. Come on. - Mr. Khanna, please let go of the bags. I'll drop them. I'll create a good impression about you. Very good. Now my honor is in your hand. I'm here to save your honor. Please. Shall we? Dharam, what's the time in Banaras? Four... No, five hours' difference. Five hours! Oberoi, Oberoi and Oberoi. New life. New name. We have lots of cases pending under our old names. Weren't you on a pilgrimage? We are here for a pilgrimage. Englishmen washed their sins in our country for 200 years. And we've come to take a dip in the river Thames. Yes. - A dip? In Thames? - Yes. And Suman? Suman... And he, they love each other. Love. - Love? Yeah, love. - With Prem Oberoi or Gajodhar? True love doesn't ask for names, son. What's in a name? It's still me. What difference does it make? It makes a difference. What do you think Sir Yograj Khanna... ...will let his daughter marry this florist? Why not? If their love is true. There's something called honesty as well. Honesty. What has honesty given you? It's a pity that between love and money... ...you guys have always chosen money. One can buy everything with money. Love, honor, everything. Right, Dharam? Only if he could understand! The relationship you guys are forming... ...for the greed of money, will ruin many lives. I won't let that happen. Paramveer, we didn't come this far to listen to your lecture. We are here for the biggest catch of our life. Don't try to come in our way. Fine, we'll see. Yes, of course. You can see. We, too, will see you! Let's go, Dharam. Oh damn! Hello. Let's go. But this was the address he gave me. Hello. - Dharam, what are you doing? Have you lost it? Come on, Gajodhar. Come in. Thank you. Thank you very much. God bless you. I'm feeling scared, Dharam. Look at his size. What if he raises his hand? Don't worry. We'll handle it. Look over there. 'Nutty, Looney, Crazy! ' Don't worry. Sage Nutty is with us. But where is his devotee Gyanprakash? He must be close by. Where can he go? Nutty, Looney, Crazy! So you guys are home. Sorry, I couldn't come out to receive you. Last night Sage Nutty appeared in my dream. Hey, you've started coming in dreams as well? He told me... I do. I do. And yes, I guess you guys have already met Einstein. There's just a monkey over here. Sorry, Einstein. Remember, never call him a monkey. Okay, we will never call him that. His IQ is higher than that of humans. Humans as a species have failed. He has a big body and he thinks big as well. Einstein will take full care of you. You'll just have to pay a charge of 50 pounds per day. Huh? Money? He's charging us? You guys must be wondering... ...how can Sage Nutty's devotee charge any money. I believe in the philosophy, there's no such thing as free lunch. Sholay's dialogue. Hurry up, girls. There's a lot of work pending. Offerings. Show me your hand. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Offerings. Any special reason? I'd prayed in a Sikh temple that I should find my true love. And I found Prem. And Param, where did she find Prem? At Oberoi, Oberoi and Oberoi's. I wish her the best. Now I don't want anything else. Even if Prem wasn't at Oberoi, Oberoi and Oberoi's... ...then too I would've married him only. What if your father is against that? Then we'd elope and get married. How much do you love Prem? A lot. You have no idea! God, you know my brother and dad very well. Yet you made Suman fall in love with my brother. Why? Are you mad? No way! When you could not change them then how will I? Lmpossible. No way! No way! No way! You are... He's asking for money. Give him Rs. 50. His IQ is more than us. He wants pounds. You want pounds? Just a minute. Just a minute. I'll give pounds. He will give. He will give. Pound. Pound. Pound. Hey? What is this? You are giving him alcohol? Don't. What if he goes crazy? Don't worry. Nothing will happen to him. Hey... Hey, no. No, no. - Drink it. Drink it. Drink it. No, no. Just go for it. Just go for it. Yes. No. No Indian money. Pound. Pound. Pound. Yeah. Wow. Hey, Dharam. What are you looking at? 36, 24, 36. You will never change. What will I gain by changing? What's this? He actually brought real money! It's real. She's the queen. Keep her close to your heart. Who all will I keep close to my heart? I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. Drunkard No. 1. Drink. Drink. Oh, no. Now you are behaving like humans. I don't like the name Einstein. His name should be Happy. Happy Singh. Happy... We are friends forever. I shall sacrifice my life... But I shall never sacrifice our friendship. Dharam, in Banaras monkeys used to stay on the roof of our house. And here, this monkey and we are staying under the same roof. I wonder what else we'll have to endure in this country? Nothing will happen. Don't worry. You'll get engaged tomorrow. After that everything will be fine. They are getting engaged, play the music. It's time to celebrate, play the music. The moon and stars dance... When you dance, all bachelors dance with you. When you dance, everyone dances with you. When you dance, boys clap. Be careful or someone will have you kidnapped. When you dance, boys clap. Be careful or someone will have you kidnapped. Your beauty is like a rare diamond! Your dress is red in color. Your fancy extensions sting hard. Making a thousand excuses. This boy asks for your heart. When I dance, boys clap. When I sing, they rap. My beauty is like a rare diamond! My dress is red in color. My fancy extensions sting hard. Making a thousand excuses. This boy asks for my heart. Oh God, keep my beloved away from all evil. Keep our love away from all evil. Oh God, keep my beloved away from all evil. Bangles... Bangles dance around my wrist. Beloved... My beloved romances in rustic style. The flowers on your tresses made my heart skip a beat, my love. You emit mesmerizing fragrance, my love! Your dress is red in color. Your fancy extensions sting hard. Making a thousand excuses. This boy asks for your heart. Your dress is red in color. Your fancy extensions sting hard. Making a thousand excuses. This boy asks for your heart. What happened? No one would've done what you did. I didn't do anything. I just fulfilled the promise I made to your parents. May their soul rest in peace. I did nothing. Mr. Khanna... Yes? - Suman isn't your daughter? No. She's just like a daughter to me. Just like a daughter? Suman, you didn't tell them? I tried telling him a number of times. But he always stopped me saying... I don't want to know anything about your family. I love you. And with our love we shall create a new world. Wow. Thank you so much, uncle. All this is the result of your good upbringing. You have given him such great values. Yes, I've brought him up well. Hey, Param, what happened? What's so funny? - Nothing, just... I cannot believe that even in this age and time... ...something like true love really exists. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. - There you are. Everyone should have a father like you. You've given such great values to your son. Am I right, Mr. Khanna? - Yes, of course. Have some sweets. Please. - No, thank you. No? And everyone should have a son like you. You are following your father's footsteps. You should have some of this sweet for sure. And you? All this is thanks to Sage Nutty. Nutty, Looney... Crazy! Mr. Khanna, you? - Thank you. Thank you, my boy. Hey, my sweetheart. Hi. Reet! - Suman! Where were you? I'm sorry, I'm a little late. Forget it. - Oh, I'm sorry. I had to see off the guests. Fine, I can forgive you for anything. Hello, Prem. - Hello. You take good care of her. Hello, uncle. Nice to meet you. Hi. Hey. - Hi! Honey. This is Reet, my daughter. Your daughter? - Yes. Real? - Of course. The old child of Sir Yograj Khanna... ...and beloved wife Late Lady Elizabeth Michelin Walter Khanna. The great painter. She seems to have taken after her mother. But unfortunately I'm not a painter. I just work in an art gallery. My daughter has just returned from Paris. Alright, Reet, now I want you to meet Param, my boy. Didn't I tell you about him? Oh, so you are the one? - Yeah. Good guy. - Hello. Dad has praised you a lot over the phone. Thanks a million. This sound? It stopped. - Yes, it did. It stopped. Move! Move away, you rascal! Let go of it! Let go of it, Happy! Let go of it! Happy, don't let go of the bag. Don't let go of his bag. You aren't my father. You are my enemy. Relax, my boy. Relax. Relax! I'm the one who got engaged to an orphan! Relax! People break off marriages every... Can't you break off an engagement? Dharam, please come to the point, don't confuse me. No confusion. If Prem Oberoi the heir of Oberoi, Oberoi and Oberoi... ...stops loving Suman and falls in love with Reet... ...then Khanna won't mind that. Rather he'll be happy. And anyway, one cannot control his heart. Dharam, I'm sure you have done a course in being a scoundrel. Hey, don't abuse talent by calling it a course. It's God's gift. Cheers. You, too, have a drink sometimes. Alcohol doesn't suit me. I get out of control as soon as I drink it. Then you should surely drink. Is this club always this empty? Yes. It needs a redesign. - Yes. Reet, too, was saying so. Reet? She is right. Then why didn't you? I did. I did. I always did things for others. I always give to the one who came to my door. That's why today I have a palatial house. Luxury cars. Business, exotic properties. But all of these... But all of these... Are mortgaged. I've a bank loan of 10 million pounds which I have to repay. Now all I have is this club and a few shops outside. That's it. That's all I have. Sir Yograj Khanna is finished. I've not told Reet about it. I've only told you. Now that I've told you, you too leave the job. Just like the others. You too leave. Mr. Khanna, I'm with you. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Sage Nutty said the same thing. Nutty? - Thank you. God bless you. Once Suman gets married... ...l'm thinking of taking a loan from Oberoi. I'll take a loan and pay off all my creditors in the market. What's 10-20 million pounds for him? He gives 40-50 billion pounds to poor countries. He's very generous. Large heart. True, he's very generous. Listen, I have some reserve funds. Okay? You discuss this with Reet. Redesign this club. Okay? And if you fall short then pay from your pocket. Me? - We are family now. Make an inventory for the rest of the paintings. - Okay. Sure. Hi, Reet. - Oh. Hi, Prem. One second, please. And check with the curator as well. - Yes, ma'am. Okay. Thank you. That will be all. Okay, ma'am. Yes, Prem? - Well, I was just passing by. I just thought I should drop in and say hi. Prem, I wish you had called and come. I've a very busy day today. - No problem. Okay. Actually, I wanted to buy a lot of paintings for my New York office. You know, since childhood Prem has loved art. That's nice. So, why don't you look around then? And I'll be right with you. - Okay. Wow! What a painting! Brought a donkey back to life! This isn't a donkey. This is a horse. A horse? You should avoid keeping paintings of mundane painters. You never come to know what they paint. This is a Hussain. Hussain's famous horse painting. The 'Wah Taj' guy? Doesn't he play the Tambula? I'm not talking about Zakir Hussain. I'm talking about M. F. Hussain. Of course. I was just joking. - Okay. Who is this M. F. Hussain? Reet, this painting is amazing. Just like you. Thank you. Actually, this is one of my favorite paintings. Yeah? - The style reminds me of Leonardo's work. I just love Leonardo! I've seen Titanic 25 times. What a love story! I'm not talking about Leonardo Di Caprio. I'm talking about Leonardo Da Vinci. The world famous painter. I was just checking you out. - What! I mean your knowledge. Okay. - Reet. - Hi, Paramveer. You are bang on time for the meeting. I'm used to making an entrance at the right time. Hello, Mr. Oberoi. - Hello. Shall we go now? - Yes. Prem, we have a meeting scheduled with an architect... ...to discuss the club designs. I've got to go now. It was lovely discussing art with you. Bye. Let's go. My Gajodhar is here. Did things go well with Reet? Things are working out well. What things are working out? You are wasting a lot of time. My style is different. - What style do you have? If I would've been in your place... ...then she would've got pregnant by now. You are just giving me a headache. Hurry up, do something. Happy! Learn something from him. Hi, handsome. - Hi. Do it again. Wanna dance? Lovely hands. - Have a look! Reet's calling me. She's just calling you, it's not like she is here. Hi, Prem. - Hi, Reet. You wanna come for a drive? - Of course. Okay, bye. Yes, yes. Why not! Of course. Just wait. - I love you. I love you. I'll be waiting. - I'll call you soon. Oh, you are so sweet. Yeah. Yeah. Really? Okay. See you soon. Bye. Dharam, Reet wants to go for a drive with me. You stay here and kill time with the monkey. I'll make a move. Hi, Reet. - Hi. You look great. - Thank you. And what about me? I wish I could say the same about you. Just joking! Good. Good joke. So, where are we going for a drive? Surprise! You? - Yes! My phone got conked off. That's why I asked Reet to call you. Hop in. - Yes. Reet, I'm thinking of finding a nice boy for you. Someone like him? No thanks. Why? What's wrong with Prem? - Yes? He's too knowledgeable for me. Knowledgeable? - Right, Prem? I wonder what kind of a boy you will find. Paramveer. - Paramveer? Hi, Param. - Hi. I've just mailed you some new designs. I'm sure you'll like it. Just check it. Thank you so much. That's fantastic. You're a sweetheart. Hey, listen, do you wanna come for a drive? Drive? Isn't this knowledgeable boy enough for you two beautiful girls? Where are you? - He's busy I think. Me? I'm in the club. I'll pick you up in 10 minutes. - Okay. I'll see you in the car park. Reet. Drive. Oh God! Hey! Bunty Singh is here to teach you a lesson! - Yes! You guys are back to get thrashed? How did he recognize us? I don't know about you but I'm not someone who can be easily forgotten. He must've recognized you. He doesn't recognize me. Hey! Come here. Param, wait. Prem, you go ahead. Today show them that you are not just knowledgeable... ...but strong as well. Yeah, Prem. Go for it, Prem. You can do it. My brother! I've brought you here to beat him and not hug him. - Yes. You'll have to keep the promise that you made. Whether he's a Sikh or Kartar, you'll have to beat him. What will I face Dude? I'll be done for. And she'll be ruined. - Yes. You brought us here to beat our brother? Yes. - Brother never hurts anyone. You lied to us? You... Run! Run! That was awesome. Param, you are very famous. You were just amazing today. Prem, can you take a photo of us? - Yeah. My camera isn't working. I've got a camera. Here. Take. Gajodhar. My son... Yes, Dharam. Tell me. - Please come here. Come here. Come here. How was last night's drive with Reet? It was amazing! We had a candle-light dinner as well. The one that involves a candle. - Big one or a small one? Size doesn't matter. Oh really? Then what happened? - Then? We went to a discotheque. You went to a disco as well. Well done, son. You went to a disco as well. Then what happened? Then... Don't ask me to go on, I'm feeling shy. - Oh. I'm feeling ashamed, you shameless being! What is this? This! I've clicked such nice pictures, haven't I? I was impressing Reet with my photography. Are you here to get married or to create a wedding album? Look, Dharam, don't go by the photo. Paramveer was just passing by that place. And Suman too? Exactly. Gajodhar, you'll just keep watching... ...and Paramveer will take the girl away from right under your eyes. Am I not looking handsome in those photos? After all whose son am I? What are you doing here? I was just passing by and I thought... ...I should ask how you guys are doing. You are so concerned about us. Don't worry. We are going to get Khanna's all wealth. Khanna, because of whose money you guys have come here... ...that poor guy is in a lot of debt. Heard him, Gajodhar. Khanna is in a lot of debt. You are in love with his daughter. That's why he is in a lot of debt. We won't be fooled by what you say. Gajodhar, Suman loves you a lot. Never betray her. You'll never find a girl better than her. He will. He'll get her at any cost. And her name is Reet. He can't have Reet even in his dreams. He will get married to Suman. And yes, even Sage Nutty wouldn't be able to save you. Nutty, Looney, Crazy! Nutty, Looney, Crazy! Nutty, Looney, Crazy! He is challenging us. Don't worry. Whether or not you get Reet, ...but your brother will surely get her. - Paramveer? Hello. Yokozuna speaking. Yes, Bunty. Yes, full team. Okay. Love to Babli. Mr. Oberoi, what important thing did you want to discuss? It's important as well as not so important. I feel like telling you about it today. - Please. Actually, I have two sons. Prem has a twin. Twins? - Twins?! Yeah. Twins. - How? He just came to London. I thought I should introduce him to you. Sure. Why didn't you tell me about this any sooner? Everything needs to be done at the right time. You are right. Prem's twin will be interesting like Prem. They are coming together, right? That's the problem, Mr. Paramveer. Oh. - They hate each other. They don't get along at all. One doesn't stay where the other is. Prem is a very good businessman... ...whereas he is a very good painter. Oh. Painter! Oh, he's a genius. I'd love to meet him. - Me too. Mr. Hussain's mare. Doesn't stop following me. Gaja Gamini. Doesn't it look as if Prem has come here... ...wearing fake moustache and glasses? Param, they are identical twins. Then why did he need a moustache? Param, now do you understand Oberoi, Oberoi... And Oberoi. Son, what is your name? Q. - Why? Because I want to know your name. Because his name is Q. P Q R S T... - Q. Oh. - Very unique name. I didn't want anyone to guess my caste, religion... ...or my country by my name. Right. - I'm human and they should consider me a human. As soon as I saw you I understood... ...that you have genius bacteria inside you. Mr. Genius, how many minutes apart... ...were you and your brother born? Two. Two minutes. Oh. Two minutes. He was born. I made Maggi and Prem was born. Grand entry. Q, what type of a painter are you? 'Dabang' type. 'Dabang' type? Fearless. - Fearless. The things renowned painters fear painting... Is what Q makes. Oh really? - Oh. So, Q, what kind of a brush do you use? Ajanta. - Toothbrush?! Toothbrush! He uses toothbrush, hairbrush, shoe brush... He uses all types of brushes. But he doesn't use painting brush. That's why... - That's why I wanted. Yeah. - If you were so wanted then where were you hiding? It's no secret, I'm in the clouds, the rain... I'm in a scorpion. I'm a soldier who is close to everyone's heart. You shouldn't fool around like a stranger... ...you are a dear one and dear ones are always very dear. Nutty, Looney, Crazy! Oh yeah. That too. - Huh? Q, I've always admired crazy painters. What do you have to say about Dali? Yeah! - Dali, Dali... Each branch, each leave, each plant knows how I am. You are so funny. Mr. Q, I've got one more question. Excuse me. Where's the washroom? That way. - Thank you. Please take care of this. Okay. - Please don't mind. Even geniuses go to the toilet. - Oh yeah. Param, he's quite an interesting guy. Yeah, very interesting. Interesting family. What mess have I got myself into by becoming a painter? Picasso. Van Gogh... Dali... Dali was a painter? Why did you! Dali... - Prem? Yes? Why are you roaming around with a moustache and glasses? Are you going for a fancy dress competition? No. - Take them off. They don't look good on you. No! No! No! - Prem! Prem! No! - Prem! Prem, listen! No! No! - Prem, listen to me! Prem! - No! - Prem! Prem! Prem! Prem! Listen to me! Suman! Listen to me! - Prem, what is this craziness? Take them out! They don't look good on you! No! No! No! - What is she doing? - Prem! No! - What are you doing, Suman? - Prem! Suman, he is not Prem. - No! Then who is he? - He is Q. He is Q? - Yes. - His name is Q. He's Prem's twin brother. Q. - I'm sorry Mr. Q. But why such moustaches? My Prem looks so handsome without a moustache. Suman, both my sons are very handsome. He keeps a moustache so that I too know... ...who is Q and who is not Q. Hence I've been drawing a moustache... ...on my face since childhood. And hence then I have gotten into the habit of painting. Oh. - That's why. - Funny. Mr. Q, I'm sure your painting... ...will be just as unique as your name. - Yeah. Why not? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'd love to see your paintings. You would? - Yes. She would. She would... She would! Check. Gajodhar, you have been painting since 5 hours. Will you take 5 days to make it? I'm giving the final touches. I'm giving the final touches. Hey, where's my queen? Why are you behaving like this? Where's my queen? Yes! Look at this! My masterpiece. - What a masterpiece. Yeah! - What is this? What is it! Stop clapping. Stop it! What have you made? I'd got a ten on ten for this in school. Reet isn't in school. She'll start running as soon as she sees it. I've heard that world's every genius painter... ...drinks and makes a masterpiece. Gajodhar, you too should drink today. Drink as much as you want, my son. Perhaps, you might get a masterpiece idea. Gajodhar, did you get any idea. Everything is swimming. - Swimming? It's slowly swimming... Oh God, this hangover! Alcohol ruins the next morning. Huh! This... Gajodhar... - Yes? Who... who has created this mess? I don't know. And... and that painting? Did you make it? How can I make such a bad painting? Where is that scoundrel? Where's Happy? Look, Happy has become colorful. Bloody drunkard. He's become Technicolor. He's behind all this. Before anyone sees this painting let's throw it out. Otherwise, both of us will get deported. Just a minute. Dharam, she is crying. - The painting is such. Mark! Spencer! Wow! You are the next Picasso. It's amazing. I love it. You like it so much? - Yes. Consider it a gift from me for your art gallery. Thank you so much, Q. Yes! Param, come here. I want to show you something. Yeah. You okay? - Yeah. Take a look at Q's painting. It touches the soul. Handkerchief. You can see that Q's miraculous painting... ...is making the world shed tears. How are you feeling? This painting reflects the metaphysical pain... ...of the inner turmoil of the painter. No, no. I believe this painting shows... ...the inherent desire of the artist to be one with the universe. Hey! - Q! Q! I love you! He's a true artist in the true sense of the word. Every day whether or not... It's not what you see that is art. Art is the gap, you know what I mean? I mean your paintings are post colonial, post... Shut up! Dude wants this painting. Dude wants this painting. Mom! How do you like the world to remember you? There was once a great painter. What inspires you to do your painting? Sorry. No more questions. - Hey Q! Come on, Prem! Answer the goddamn phone! Today, I'm ready to face any mountains! You called me, and here I am. I would've killed you if you wouldn't have come here. You would've killed me? You would've killed me? Mr. Khanna, the nightclub is ready. And this is the promotional plan. Billboard, internet, TV and everything. - No! No! No! This is very expensive! It's going to be very expensive. I've taken care of it. I've made the arrangements. Param, just think... - What? A queue of youngsters outside the nightclub. A queue of oldies. A queue of beautiful foreigners. A queue of dark-skinned people. A queue of fans. A queue of media. Queues everywhere. Historical queue. - That's very good. And what if all this happens for free? But why will this happen for free? We'll make Q the chief guest for our nightclub's opening. Q? - But why will Q do it? Because he's just like family now. You don't worry. - That's my worry. Param, my boy, it looks like Q has been sent from top for us. Who is that?! Hey, Prem! How come you are here? - Prem! Prem, are you alright? - What happened, Suman? Nothing, we were playing the 'Ek Tha Tiger' game. She means like in the movie Tiger goes... ...to meet his beloved by climbing a pipe... I too did that. But for this Tiger this pipe is very weak. Please change it and save the Tiger. Anyway, there are hardly any Tigers left in this world. Good night. Good night. - Good night. Param, he had handed me a university's degree. Don't worry, Mr. Khanna. After marriage even the best Tigers become pet cats. You're right. So, Mr. Khanna, what's the good news? I've fixed the wedding date, it's after 10 days. My wedding? Where's the bride? You'll find a bride as well but you'll have to contact my boy Param. He can arrange anything for you. We will find a bride for you later. But for now, Mr. Khanna is talking about Suman and Prem's wedding. Here, have some sweets. Aren't you happy? I am happy. Why won't I be happy? But what's the hurry? It's your son who is in a hurry. Am I right, Mr. Groom? For how long will the poor guy play 'Ek Tha Tiger' late in the nights? What was the need to play 'Ek Tha Tiger' with Suman? I was tired of saying intelligent things with that moustache on. For some time I wanted to be what I am. People risk their life when they are about to do something big. And you are tired of saying intelligent things! Happy, reason it with him. Hey! What's wrong with him? - Happy? Fly away, oh pigeon! Fly away, oh pigeon! Fly away, oh pigeon! Now what is this? - Suman has sent me a love letter. Through this pigeon? Just a minute. Hey, stop your movie style drama. Don't disturb me. - Stop it! You always keep bossing around me! Why don't you do something about that Paramveer... ...who is messing up everything? Now, don't disturb me. Paramveer. Hello. Hi. Bunty Hiroshima. And Babli Nagasaki reporting, Dude-G. What is the report? Plan bombed. What do you mean? There were so many Sumos that the plane couldn't take off. Yes! - Yes. Yes! - Yes. Yes! - Yes. But you don't worry, Dude-G. They are coming in a big Titanic like ship. - Yes. Titanic! - Yes. The one that sank. - Yes. That means even this one will sink. - Yes. No! Do one thing. Call Bruce Lee's grandson Dead Lee in Mainland China... Yes? - Yes. Param, we did it. The place looks absolutely amazing. Thank you so much. I couldn't have done it without you. You're a sweetheart. What was that? Actually, I want to say something. I, too, am in a mood to listen. I... - Yeah? Oh God. - Just say it. Reet... - Hi, uncle. Don't worry about that. Just tell me. What do you want to tell me? - I... Go on... Reet, dear... - Yes. Come. Come here. I'm sorry. I'll be right back. Reet, darling, I feel like drinking and dancing today. Paramveer and you have made such a colorful club. And both of you look so dull. You should celebrate it. You should have drinks in your hand. Enjoy with him. Cheers. It goes in and true feelings come out. - Sorry? I was talking to my drink. Oh. - Cheers. One bottle of scotch, please. Cheers. Cheers. I don't drink. - Drink it.

Can you tell me why Q is famous? Hint. Hint. Hint. His moustache. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it. Param! What are you doing? - Mr. Khanna, shall I tell you? Shall I say everything about you... - Quiet. Go and have a seat. Q... - Paramveer! Mr. Paramveer. - Yes? Why do you drink when you cannot control yourself? You should think about our honor. Your honor? Mr. Oberoi, Oberoi, Oberoi. You have honor factories all across the world. There is no better actor than you, dad! Dad? And actor number two, my brother. Where are you going? Why was he addressing you as dad and Q as his brother? Why was he saying it? Yes, after the engagement didn't he say that... ...everyone should have a brother like me. And everyone should have a brother like my son. Now his gear is stuck because he is drunk. Where is your twin Prem? Prem had an important business meeting. Oh yeah, yeah. Meeting! In the middle of the night? Have you guys ever thought... ...why don't we ever see the two of them together? They hate each other. - Wrong. They love each other. They both love each other so much that... ...if one is strangled then it hurts the other as well. Mr. Oberoi, find out whether your other son's neck is hurting. Hello, Prem? Where are you, son? Param, stop it. He will get hurt. He has seen it all. A deal of Rs. 2 billion? To hell with it. You come here right away. One hour? Okay, but come. He is coming in one hour. - One hour?

Very violent man. - No, no he is fine. He is fine. Oh no! This bloody F1! Hi! Hello? Param, how are you feeling? My head is blasting. Do you have any idea of what you did last night? Did... did I make a big mistake? Yes, you did. - I did? Yesterday, you were trying to say something to me... I... l... You didn't complete it. Do you remember? - Oh God. I'm coming over.

Drive you crazy 'cause my name is... - Sheila! Are just... ...dreams! A family always supports each other. A family always supports each other. - Not fair, God! Dharam! Look at your Formula 44. He didn't make a painting. He is taking advantage of our goodness. Hey, are you trying to be King Kong? Why didn't you make the painting? Scoundrel. What's wrong with him? - You drank all our liquor last night. Who will make the painting? He drank all the liquor and had fun with Sheila as well. You had loads of fun. Who will make the painting? Your father? Hey! You don't know who we are! Seems like Paramveer's ghost has possessed him. I want Q. Why? Because now Q will just make one painting in his life. Whose? Did you ask me whose? - Yes. Did you really ask me whose? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Slap yourself. - What? Yeah. Yeah. Slap. Slap. Come on. Come on. Harder. Harder. Harder. Mine. Dude's. Who else's? Oh!

How? - How about if your two daughters and his two sons... ...get married on the same day? Wow! Great idea! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah - Sir Yograj Khanna... You very well know that it's impossible. Why? - Because unfortunately my sons hate each other. You'll never get a better opportunity... ...to change hatred into love. Just imagine. What a photo frame it will be! Oberoi, Oberoi and Oberoi. Suman, my child... - Hi, uncle. Have a seat. - What are you doing here? Something untoward has happened. I cannot say it. But if I don't then it will be unjust to you. What happened, uncle? Dear, Prem and you cannot get married. We cannot get married? Why? Because Prem... cannot wear Raymunda. Is that all? If he doesn't want to wear this suit... ...then I'll talk to my tailor Reid and get another suit made for him. Even Reid and Taylor cannot do anything, dear. Raymunda means, a complete man. And Prem... Prem... I cannot say it. This is his medical report. Read it. Prem isn't a complete man. I'm so sad, dear. That he cannot take my name forward. Leave him. Suman, how come you are here? What happened? Am I so bad? Why didn't you tell me that you cannot wear Raymunda? I cannot wear Raymunda? - You can't. Why can't I wear Raymunda? You cannot. - Why can't I? You cannot. Your dad has told me everything. Dad? Dad... I cannot wear Raymunda? You cannot. I'm not getting it. Prem, in the beginning it is a little difficult to face such a thing. But don't worry. We will together face this harsh world. To hell with Raymunda. - To hell with Raymunda? Suman, why are you ruining your life? It is very important to wear Raymunda. Why are you guys talking about Raymunda? Yes? Prem... I know that... That you are... Impotent. Yes, I'm important. Not important. You are impotent. Impotent. I'm impotent? - Yes. I am? Yes, you are. I am impotent. - Good. You'll be able to face the truth you keep saying that. So what if we cannot have kids? We'll... We'll adopt. Dad, we'll adopt. How can you adopt them! I... think it will be better... ...if we should tell her about your horoscope as well. Yes, we should. Suman... I can't find enough courage to say this. The priest we showed Prem's horoscope... ...said that the girl he marries... ...will die 7 months after their marriage... Now I... The 7 months I'll spend with you... ...will be better than 7 lifetimes without you. I... I love you. To you... I dedicate... My life, my love. My life, my love. What are you thinking about, Gajodhar? I heard the To you. You heard my name? Not your name, the To you song. I'm in love with Suman. How many times have I told you to have fun... ...but never fall in love. What you told was wrong. Dharam, we are thugs. Our specialty is that whenever we fool anyone... ...they at that moment, unknowingly... ...happily give us all their money. But today... Today, for the first time we have formed a relationship with someone. And we are playing with their lives. This... - Why? Because we are scared of facing the truth. What truth? That Paramveer is right and we are wrong. We are wrong, Dharam. We cannot buy love and respect with money. Paramveer and Reet... ...love each other. We shouldn't come in between them. We'll lose even if we win, Dharam. I've decided. I'll tell the truth to Suman. I'll take care of whatever happens. You've been hijacked. He means you have been kidnapped. But who are you? He is Joe Armstrong. He is going to make the 8th wonder of the world. You didn't even know that? He himself looks like a wonder to me. Wonder! I like that. I like that! You liked it? - Yeah. You liked it? We all liked it. Great. The Dude is dangerous. Now whenever I fire a bullet, someone will die. Even if it's one of our men. Attack! Now tell me, where is Q, the one who made the world cry? Come on. Dude-G, I can tell you where he can be. Look, this is 'P'. - And this is 'R'. And Q should be between it? - Yes. Correct. Should be. Should be. But Q is not there. That's exactly what I am asking. Where is Q? You don't know? You don't know? Dude wants Khanna and his family now, please. Get them. Get them. Get them. Mr. Armstrong, I'm ready to give you the land. But please, let go of the Oberois. Oberoi greetings. Good. Arrangements have been made for the 8th wonder. Dude is happy. Clap. Clap. Clap. But Q will make the 9th wonder. So, where is Q? Once again. Q is out of our lives, Mr. Blonde. Hold on, Dude is extremely angry. Bring in the cars. Stop. Q is here. - What? Please forgive me if you can. Anything... Here you go. Q has come. - Oh no! Then where is Prem? You really think Dude is a fool, huh? Quickly tell me where your brother is. Dude, I'm my brother. He's said something which has a very deep meaning. We'll have to call a psychiatrist! What! Dude! Dude! - Shut up, both of you, please! Dude! Dude! We've had enough ofjokes. Now a lot of people will have to die. Never make such a mistake. Because if my brother comes here then you'll be in big trouble. Now which brother are you talking about? You just said that you are your brother. My real brother. Who is he? Paramveer is your brother? We've made a whole movie on this relationship. Now how do I explain it to you? Dude-G! He is that Super Sikh! He will dig our graves! Super Sikh? What are you waiting for? Kill him. Dude is... Dude is impressed. Dude liked what you did. Very impressive. What you did so far just created a storm. Now Dude will bring an earthquake! You wanna watch! You want to watch! Okay! Bring in the earthquake! Come on! Come on! Oh no! Prem! No! No! Yes! Yes! Sir Yograj Khanna. You were going to thug us. You are a scoundrel. Ditto. Ditto Duck. There. Come on. Come on. Dude is dead. Reet, are you alright? - Yes, I'm fine. Uncle, what about you? Uncle... Reet! All your problems will be solved after selling this painting. Sold! But one problem still remains. Say it at least now! This sound! It's my heart saying, I love you. Yeah! They are settled for life. Come on, let's play 'Ek Tha Tiger'. - Yes. Prem! I've changed that pipe. It's of no use now. Our setting? Paining. Money. Buckingham Palace. Kohinoor. Okay? Nutty, Looney, Crazy!
