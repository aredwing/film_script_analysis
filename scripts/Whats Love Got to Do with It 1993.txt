It's the cool sound of KAJT... and here comes the hot sound of the British invasion: Manford Mann and "Do Wah Diddy." Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do Snappin' her fingers and shufflin' her feet Singin' do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do - She looked good - Looked good - She looked fine - Looked fine She looked good she looked fine And I nearly lost my mind Before I knew it she was walkin' next to me - Singin' - Do wah diddy diddy, dum, diddy, do Holdin' my hand just as natural as can be - Singin' - Do wah diddy diddy, dum, diddy, do So what's your take on the new English music invading the States? Well, Ike said there ain't nothin' new about it. Ain't nothin' but black music. I mean, negro music with an accent. But, personally, I like a lot of it. Ike, you... I sense you don't feel fully appreciated here? Well, we have been doin' a lot of tourin' all over the country, and... Ike's been writin' a lot of great new songs. Ike... - Thank you. - Oh, sure. You're welcome. Thank you. Jackie! Jackie! Whoo! Hey, you motherfuckers, be quiet out there! I'm tryin' to work, goddamn it! I'll be right back. Ike, come on, come on, come on. Come on, take a break? What you talkin' about take a break? I ain't got no time to take a break. I got to work. I got to write these songs. Sue Records motherfuckers... been after me about these songs for six months. You know how much money I owe Sue Records? What you mean owe Sue Records? As much as we work? They always givin' you stacks of cash whenever we do a show... - and I know I don't spend it. - Oh, no? Well, what about... all them wigs and wardrobe and whatnot you got in the back there? What about the way you got this place decked out? All this furniture, that fish tank, the sofas, that fountain and shit. That shit costs money, Anna Mae. I got to pay the girls, and I got to pay the band... and on top of that, I'm tryin' to build us a studio. - You know, you want the studio. - And I'd have it by now... if you would sing the songs the way I tell you to sing 'em, Anna Mae, goddamn. That's what I've... I been tryin' to do, Ike. I mean, but they all sound like the same, you know? What? I ain't hear you. What you say? I ain't hear you. I ain't hear you. What you say? I said... I mean, not exactly, you know. I mean, but you... you do have your own style. My own style. - - What's wrong? Ike, you promised you wouldn't hit me. Don't hit me, please! - Seems like you wanna fight? - No, no! No! No! Where you goin'? Come here. Here we go. Here we go? No! Stop! - Come here. - No! No! Ike, please! Please! - Ike, no! - Shut the fuck up! - Oh! Come back! No! Ike, please! - Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Guess you gonna leave me now? Go on, then. Now keep your behind in there, hear? Everything all right. Me and your mama just talkin'. Go on. Y'all go on! I said go on! Oh, Anna. Oh. No, no, no. I'm all right. I'll be out in a second. Somebody needs to slap his ass around. Thank you. He just got a lot of worries right now, you know? But I know he's sorry. Is he sorry for all the other times too? - He's a pig! - Don't do that, Jackie. Don't do that. Can't nobody understand that he got a lot of... a lot of pressure right now? Money. Music ain't right. This, that and the other thing, and what I do? I insult him when I know he try. No, Anna. Look, this has got to stop. You can't keep hiding black eyes from us, pretending like nothin's happenin'. We know. I know what I gotta do, you know. I'm gonna help get it back on track. And then things between me and him gonna get better. Thank you. Now, your last few songs haven't quite reached the all-time popularity... of "Fool in Love," but you're still going strong. It must be difficult to be such a busy performing couple. - How do you do it? - Well, Ike's always busy writin' songs... touring, you know, everything, and me, I'm just a homebody, you know? I love cookin', cleanin', takin' care of the boys. So between the two of us, it just works out. And here they are with their contribution... to the latest dance craze sweeping the nation.

Oh, my God. Roger Davies came. I would like, this evening, to say hello to those of you... who are participating in this lovely venture here tonight. I really want this manager to sign me. I'm so nervous. And we are very, very happy tonight to have an old-time favorite. - "Old-time"? - Miss Tina, of Ike and Tina Turner Revue. Go get 'em, grandma. Whoo! You're burnin'. We love you! Oh, baby! Whoo! I don't want to see a show if I have to pay extra. It's included, sir. Have a seat. - Does it come with a drink? - No, ma'am. Nah, that's how they get ya. Burn, baby, burn - Yes - Burn, baby, burn - Burnin' - To my surprise One hundred stories high People gettin' loose now Gettin' down on the roof I tell you - We love you, honey! Folks screamin' Out of control It was so entertainin' When the boogie starts to explode I heard somebody say Burn, baby, burn - Disco inferno - Burn, baby, burn - Burn that mother down now - Burn, baby, burn - Disco inferno - Burn, baby, burn Oh, you see, Ike... Ike was straight R & B. You know? My baby done left me... took all my money, cut up my clothes. Oh, I'm standin' here naked. I'm so sad. But I ain't about the blues anymore, you know? - Well, what are you about? - Rock and roll. - Yeah? - Yeah! - Rock and roll. - That's right. I'm talkin' 'bout the energy of it. Fun stuff, you know? You hear it in the music of, like, Bowie and Jagger. You know? That's the stuff I wanna do. You know? Not that old sad-sack stuff I used to do with Ike, and... not this borin' stuff I have to do for these hotels. You know, rock and roll is for young people. It's... it's a very different audience to what you'd be used to with Ike. I just believe that anything is possible. You know? Anything. Now, it took me a long time to get Ike out of my system. And now that I've done that, I'm ready. I'm ready, and I know what I want. Tina, cheers. To you. - To us. - To us. - Oh, I'll see you tomorrow, noon. Yes! - Noon? Where you goin'? - No, you need to come in early. - Hey, Tina... between you and Roger, how do you expect us to get any rest? - Yeah, we'll both stay up till then. - Oh, good night, fellas. Hello, Anna Mae. Hey, look, I... I just wanna talk to you, now. Give me a few minutes of your time. No. I don't think so, Ike. Come on, Ann. Now hold on. Look, I brung you somethin'. I brung a... I brung a gift for you. Hold on. Look here. You gonna like this. Oh, yeah, you gonna like this. Look here. Come on. I brung 'em for you. Now go on and take 'em. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Now I'm, I'm... look, I just... I just need to talk to you couple, two, three minutes, all right? All right? I'm not gonna make it. I need to talk to somebody. Please. All right. Two minutes. All right. Two minutes. There you go. That's... Okay. Okay, two minutes. Two minutes. Goddamn, girl! You look good! Thanks. - What's that you got on? You smell good. - Look, Ike... - All right, all right, all right. - What is this about? Well, the record company tryin' to put me in jail. Talkin' 'bout I owe them all kind of money, and, well, I got to do somethin'. Well, you do, Ike. I mean, you took a lot of advance money, and you didn't make good on it. Yeah, well, look here. I know all that, but... see, if I could just get me another hit record, I'd be all right. They'd get off my back, give me some slack. You know what I'm talkin' about? Look... I've been writing some songs. Yeah, I have, and I wrote this one song. It's called... goddamn, I forgot the name of it. Anyway, look, I wrote it for you. And it's got... I mean, it's a beautiful love song. It's got that real nice, slow groove everybody listen to now. And, every time I hear it, it remind me of us. I got my own band now, you know? I got my own songs. But look here, that... a lot of that stuff you doin' now, there ain't nobody gonna buy that. I mean, maybe somebody buy it, but it ain't like you and me. I mean, when we was together, our thing was like this here. Look, I really gotta go. Just, just hold on a second, will ya? I got one more thing I wanna say to you. Look, I been doin' a lot of thinkin', and... Two minutes. All right, now! I... look... I... goddamn it, I miss you, Ann. I'm tired of this. This... this done gone on long enough, and I want you to come home now. I know everything between us wasn't... look, everybody got problems, Ann. I'm tryin' to take care of mine, and I gave up that narcotic. I'm just... look, I'm tellin' you right here and right now I'm gonna... I'm gonna try and do right by you this time. Bye, Ike. Bye? Wait a minute. I ain't through talkin' to you yet now. Think about this. I made you. You wasn't nothin' without me, and you ain't gonna be nothin' without me. You know, I was wonderin' when old Ike Turner was gonna show up. You get on. Do your La-Di-DA thing. Go ahead. Yeah, all right. Right on. You ain't Donna Summers. I'm gonna see you again, Ann. Goddamn it, you done broke my window. Look what you done did, now. You done messed up a nice automobile. That's all right. I'm gonna take care of it. This shit ain't over, Anna Mae. You can believe this shit ain't over. I'm a sole survivor - Sole survivor - Okay, well, it's very exciting. We've booked the Ritz in New York City. One of the reasons for doing the showcase at the Ritz... is that, a lot of these people, a lot of these doubters can come along... and see how exciting this new stuff really is and how... how focused she really is at the moment. In Buddhism we do a chant called "Nam myoho renge kyo"... and what that signifies is that everything in our life is cause and effect. If there's anything within you that needs to be changed, you do it. You change it. Can Tina Turner really make a comeback at age 44? - Forty-three! Here. - Thank you. Tell 'em to get it straight. Who is it? 'Bout time he turned up. Ike Junior, mother. Hey. What happened? Who did this to you, Junior? Father. He freaked out. Kicked me out of the house. Jackie? Come on in here. Get me somethin' to clean him up with, please. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine. - What happened? - Turn that off. Please. Come on. Ronnie. Listen, I don't want you goin' back over there, all right? I want you to stay with me. Mama, there's somethin' you should know. I mean, he's been sayin' crazy stuff. I mean, anybody mention you or the show at the Ritz, he just go nuts. He go nuts. Said you ain't gonna walk out on that stage. - That man has got a hit out on you. - Thank you, Jackie. Listen, Junior, don't you think about that, you hear me? I'm sorry. I know it hurts. Mama, he wants to hurt you. He's going to hurt you. I don't know what he's gonna do. Come here. I'm sorry. I know it hurts. - Five minutes, miss Turner. - Okay, thank you. All right, now listen. I'm going out the front. See you after the show. Okay. All right. Roger? - Thanks. - Good luck? Yeah, come in. Damn, who died? You got enough flowers in here for a funeral? How'd you get in here, Ike? What do you want? Hey, it's a big night for little Anna Mae. I come to see the show just like everybody else. - How'd you get past security? - Oh, come on, now. You know me better than that. Now look here, I told you. I told you it wasn't over. I told you you was gonna see me again. Here I am, big and bold as shit. Didn't even believe me. Thought you was gonna get away from me. Thought, thought, thought a nigger like me was gonna let you get away from me? You can't get away from me, Ann. I'm in here! Now you gonna act like you don't even know me. Yeah, I know you, Ike. I know you real well, all right? All right, Ann. You know me so well... tell me what I'm gonna do now. Come on. I can't hear you. You ain't got all that mouth now. Come on. Tell me. Talk to me, Ann. I can't hear you. That supposed to scare me? Oh, yeah. What you gonna do? I don't know. Do what you wanna do, Ike. I don't care. Let me tell you what I'm gonna do. I got a room full of people who've come to see me. You hear me, Ike? Come to see me. So what do you wanna do? I don't know. Shoot me? Pistol-whip me? Here she is, in her first solo performance at the Ritz. Ladies and gentlemen, Tina Turner! You must understand Though the touch of your hand Makes my pulse react That it's only the thrill Of boy meetin' girl Opposites attract It's physical Only logical You must try to ignore That it means more than that Oh, what's love got to do Got to do with it What's love but a secondhand emotion What's love got to do Got to do with it Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken It may seem to you That I'm acting confused When you're close to me If I tend to look dazed I read it someplace I've got cause to be There's a name for it There's a phrase that fits But whatever the reason you do it for me Oh, what's love got to do Got to do with it What's love but a secondhand emotion What's love got to do got to do with it Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken I've been taking on a new direction And I have to say I've been thinkin' about my own protection It scares me to feel this way Oh, what's love Got to do, I said got to do with it What's love but a secondhand emotion What's love got to do Got to do with it Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken Got to do got to do with it - What's love? - What's love but a secondhand emotion - What's love - Got to do, I say got to do with it Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken There's a pale moon in the sky The kind you make your wishes on Like the light in your eyes The one I built my dreams upon It's not there any longer Something happened somewhere and we both know why But me I'm gettin' stronger We must stop pretending I can't live this lie I don't care who's wrong or right I don't really wanna fight no more Too much talkin', babe Let's sleep on it tonight I don't really wanna fight no more This is time for letting go I hear a whisper in the air That simply doesn't bother me Boy, can't you see that I don't care Or are you looking right through me - It seems to me that lately - Seems to me that lately You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry - Could it be that maybe - Could it be that maybe This crazy situation is the reason why I don't care who's wrong or right I don't really wanna fight no more Too much talkin', babe Don't care now who's to blame I don't really wanna fight no more This is time for letting go Hanging on to the past It only stands in our way We have to grow for our love to last But we just grew apart Don't wanna hurt no more But, baby, don't you know No, I don't wanna hurt no more Too much talkin', babe Don't care now who's to blame I don't really wanna fight no more Tired of all these games I don't care who's wrong or right I don't really wanna fight no more This time I'm walkin', babe So let's sleep on it tonight I don't really wanna fight no more This is time for letting go
