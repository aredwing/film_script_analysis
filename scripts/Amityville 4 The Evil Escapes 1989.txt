We don't know what to expect here. ... even very far of grace the Lord is with me. Bless them till the end. I don't think so. Excuse me. Anything you have... This one is the same colour that's in my room. Right here. Well, Father. It's gone. Are you sure? The house would not let me stand here otherwise. Could it be a trick. Maybe it's laying low for now. Sickness has been known to trick even priests. Lord knows it's done it to me more times than I care to admit. But not this time. I just feel it in my bones. He's quit the house. Somewhere there must be a young handsome artist. There is so much junk Helen, we're wasting a perfectly good day. Honey, don't run around. Sweetheart, come here. - Why? Rhonda. Look at this. This is just perfect. This is ugly. - Yeah, that's why it's perfect. One hundred dollars. Even the price is right. Helen, you're not gonna buy this ... this ... Monstrosity? Of course, I am. A matter of fact I think I'm gonna give it to my sister as a birthday present. You think she'll like it? Well, I think she'll understand it. It's gonna make her laugh. Well, that's the point. In our age things aren't as important as fun. Well it'll cost you more to ship it than it's worth. - Well, I can afford it. Oh, damn. That thing is sharp. Oh, thanks. Maybe we ought to get you tetanus shot. Don't worry about it, I'll be fine. Coming, coming. Hi. Postal on the national? - Oh, yeah, Right here. Okay. Would you sign up form for me please? - Sure. That's a nasty looking finger, lady. At my age I've had worse. Hope, I won't. Thank you. All right, look at this. It's like living in the country. It is living in the country. Out houses and the wild animals. Very funny. It's probably five miles from school. Two miles. I used to ride my bike all the time. - Right. In hell storms of the broken leg. After washing the dishes and doing the laundry. That's right. Hey ... Here it is. Hey, there's a delivery truck. Is that our stuff, mom? Wrong company. Besides I don't expect it for a week. House is bigger than I remember. Looks older too. - This, older? So are you. - But I'm not the aged. - Not yet. Look, there's grandma. Okay, you guys. Be nice. Hi grandma. Oh, Brian. Oh, you've grown. I swear you're going to take after your grandfather's side of the family. Oh, good trip? Piece of cake. Hi mom. Good to see you. Amanda, welcome. - Hi grandma. And Jessica. Oh, come give me a hug. Come on, Jessica. Oh, that's right. Oh, that's good. Do I have to share room, grandma? No one will have to share. I've got it all worked out. - What'd you buy, mom? I didn't. It's a gift from your aunt Helen. I'm sure it's another one of her little jokes. Looks like a pretty big joke to me. Just put it in the living room. Around to your right. Well, thanks. Thank you very much. Hey, look grandma got a bird. Wouldn't you remember Fred? Oh no, you wouldn't. I got him since you were here last. That would be ... two years. Can he speak? He can say, pretty bird. Maybe while you're here you can teach him a few words. Can I see my room, grandma? Upstairs, third door on the left. Brian will be across the way. - Thanks. Pretty bird. You have Jessica next to me. Right, mom? - Oh, yeah. Open the present, grandma. Do you think it might be something really special? Yeah, I do. All right then. Let's find out. Brian ... fetch me a sharp knife from the kitchen. You'll find it in the drawer to the right of the sink. Now, what can that be? Pepper. How are you? You remember me? Huh, kitty. Remember when me and dad took that thorn out of your paw? Aunt Helen must have money to burn sending something this big all the way from the Long Island. Maybe the jokes on her this time. It has the look of them. Genuine antique. Mother, it's as ugly as sin. You see? Even Fred agrees with me. You know a little, but it's fairly interesting. Hey, look who I found. Pepper! Oh, honey. Are you all right? - Why was she troubling you like that? You were squeezing her. - Was not. - Were too. - All right, all right. - Pepper. Pepper, kitty. She probably just agrees with Fred. I mean about that lamp. Well, honey you better wash it out. - Mom, do you have any peroxide around here? - Upstairs, in my medicine chest. I know it's been a long time since you've had your house invaded like this, mom. I mean, I really didn't know what else to do. Frank's life insurance money was dwindling away on living expenses. This way I'll have fighting chance. In a year I'll have my teaching credentials and And I think I'm going to sell the mortgage. - Well, I hope you got a good rental fee for the house. Enough to cope with the carrying costs. Amazing isn't it? The words "carrying costs" seven months ago were a foreign language to me. Eighteen years of marital shelter gone in one gasp. - Well, it does seem such a shame that Frank would leave you in such a state. It's not what I meant. Well, I'm simply pointing out that ... I know what you're pointing out. Mom, I came home, because I needed help. Not criticism. I know how you felt about Frank. But I had eighteen incredible years with him. Three wonderful kids. The man dropped it at forty two. Do you think he planned it? No, don't be rude. - I'm sorry, but expected to live beyond 42 years is neither unreasonable nor immoral. Well, if there is any fault here, it's mine ... for not making myself better prepared to earn a living. Well, it was your choice to quit college. - I know that. Could we just get passed the twenty year old arguments, please? My problem right now is Jessica. Well, she seems quite fine to me. But Amanda ... I mean, that make up and those ... those clothes. And Brian's hair. Now, what sort of haircut is that? - Mom, they're perfectly normal healthy kids. It's superficial. It doesn't mean anything. Maybe it should. I have a daughter who talks, like her father is still alive. That's a problem. She's regressed. She's an eleven year old behaving like a five year old. Time and a new environment. Yeah, I hope so. Must be some kind of power surge. What? That was our song. Frank's and mine. More tea? No, thanks. Maybe that's Frank's way of welcoming us. Maybe he thinks it's a good idea. Just a coincidence. That's all. Mom! Let me see. Oh, mom. That's bad. Well, I have seen worse, but ... I better put some aloe on it. How could that happen? Pretty bird. Pretty bird. Oh, come on, Fred. What's wrong with you tonight? Oh, I let too many people around. Are they upsetting you? Good night then. See you in the sunshine. Helen, Helen ... Honey, you startled me. You know, you're supposed to knock. Can I sleep with you? No, Jessica. We have talked about this before. You're a big girl now. But I'm scared in there all by myself. All right. Since it's a new room for you, but just for tonight. Okay? Jessica? We got a flat tyre on the freeway. Mom had to pull to the side of the road. We've got a spare, but that was flat too. Then we had to wait for over an hour for the police to call a tow to get us out of it. Then for seven hours for someone to come and change the tyre. Then we stopped to get something to eat. We got burgers, fries and two hot chocolates. Then started driving again. Brian got car sick, but mommy couldn't stop on the freeway. He got sick. in the car. Mommy, you scared him. Scared who? He's gone. Jessie ... There is nobody here. Daddy was here. Daddy's not here. He was. I talked to him. It was a dream. - No. It was him. I had a dream too. and it seemed very real, but it wasn't. And neither was yours. Jessie, daddy's gone. And he can't ever come back. It was him! Mom? My blue sweaters are wrinkled from packing. Can I wear yours? Can't you wear something else today? - I want the blue today. What's wrong with her? I don't know yet. Hundred one point two. Well, no school for you today. - Lucky. Amanda. - I'm just kidding. I saw daddy last night. It was a dream. No wonder, her fever probably started. Look, don't say stuff like that, okay? I did see him. - Just stop it! - Amanda? She's sick. - Mom, I don't care if she's sick. I don't want her talking like that. Why don't you just take the sweater, okay? It's in my closet. And hurry up about it. Jessie, she misses daddy too. It hurts her when you're saying things like that. Mrs. Leacock. I'm here. In the kitchen. Hello Peggy. Where did that lamp come from? - My sister. I'm trying to thank her, but she must have gone out early. You want to thank her for that? Don't you like it? I suppose you're gonna tell me it's a valuable antique. Would you like it any better? I'd like it less if it means we would be stuck with it. What did you do to your hand? Oh, there's something wrong with that electric kettle. Oh, well I'll call Wolf Read. Hey, Peggy. - Oh, Nancy. It's so good to see you. - It's good to see you. - Good to have you home. Tell me that after you see my three monsters. - Oh, I think I'll just go and stir them out of bed. - Good. Coffee's hot. Mom, I have a problem. Jessica has a fever. Do you want the doctor? - No, no, no. It's nothing that serious. It's just that, I'll probably have to leave her home today. Peggy and I can look after her. It's no problem. Thanks, mom. I'd hoped I wouldn't be disrupting your life too much and here I go on day one. Oh, morning, Brian. - Morning, grandma. What's for breakfast? Well, I guess I can scramble up a few eggs. - I'll scramble the eggs. The rolls are in the freezer, I'll warm up the oven. Good morning, Fred. Brian, the oven's ready. Oh, mom. Yeah, I gotta go to the club. I'll see ya. You guys all right? I get the feeling grandma thinks, what happened today was our fault. Oh, how can you say that? She took responsibility for leaving Fred's cage unlocked. - I know, but it was awfully frosty in her house. She's upset, Amanda. Just the way you're upset about your first day in the new school. That can make people frosty, right? Hey! Don't I get a kiss? You'll knock'em dead, sweetheart. See ya at dinner. Let's go, Brian. You okay? Yeah, I guess. But will grandma be okay? Don't you worry, grandma'll be just fine. I'll bet in a week she'll have another bird in that cage. Yeah, but it won't be Fred. No, it won't be Fred. I just wish things would come back. Me too. Bye, honey. - Bye, mom. I'll move that into the attic. How could I've made such an awful mistake? I could have sworn this door was closed last night. - Yeah, don't make yourself sick over this. Oh, Peggy I've been alone so long I ... I'm not sure I can handle all this commotion. I should have prepared you better for what was to happened. God knows, I've had my share of confrontations with the evil in that house. It's not a mission to be offered ... without a complete full warning. I blame myself for this. Doctor White, report to oncology. I spoke to the monsignor. He thinks it's best you return to the monastery. Could you take me back to that house? I don't think that's wise, Dennis. You told me that house is safe now. The furniture's gone? I sold it off. All of it? Whatever I couldnt sell went to the junk yard. There was a ... a standing lamp in this room. What happened to it? - Sold it as junk. Would anyone have a record? I would. I need a name and phone number. Lieutenant Strudels? This is Father Manfred. How are you? No, I'm fine. Thank you. Lieutenant, I need a favour. I have the phone number of a woman who needs my help. But she's not answering. And I'm worried. I don't have an address. I wonder if you could get it for me if I gave you her phone number. And her name. Oh, thank you. Helen Royce. Thank you. Well, I appreciate that. Tomorrow morning will be fine. Thank you. You know, this could be an overreaction on both of our parts. - I hope so. But I don't think you believe that. A dozen years ago ... evil was simply a concept in my mind. That house in Amityville has changed that concept to reality ... forever. For three hundred years ... no one has lived on that ground without tragic consequences. In recent, 1974, boy murdered his entire family, because the voices in the house told him to do it. A dozen years ago I would've thought that, what you saw on that lamp ... was a hallucination brought on by fear. Now ... Now I believe ... that the evil in that house could transmigrated to that lamp. That it can and will transmigrate into another object ... or another house ... or another person ... at the earliest opportunity. Pepper. Pepper. You're down here? Jesus, Pepper. What're you doing over here? Here. Jesus, look at all this stuff. Huh? Peggy, what in the world ... - In the basement. Oh, my god. Help. No! Stop it. Stop. Stop it! Brian! Turn it off! - I can't! No, Brian! Help me! Brian! Brian, stop it! Stop it! Stop it, Brian! Brian, stop it! Are you crazy? It's started by itself. - You switched it on. No, I didn't. Brian, don't you lie to me. I'm not lying, grandma. It started by itself when I was pretending use it, but it started by itself. It can't start by itself. - What is going on down here? - Mom, mom, it started by itself. Honest! Nancy, you know how I feel about lying. I mean, a mistake is human, but a lie is the devil's work. - Brian doesn't lie. But how do you explain all this? - I don't know, mother, but I don't think you start by calling your grandson a liar. Amanda? I'll ask ... Wolf Read to come by and take a look at the saw. And the kettle and ... And.. that old lamp it's, it's been doing funny things lately. Hi. Can't sleep? What're you reading? Oh, I figured I'd do something constructive with my insomnia. The old brain cells've been rusting for twenty years. Resting, mom ... not rusting. I hope so. Do you feel comfortable here? This is where I grew up. I feel like we're intruders. She doesn't really want us here. It's just kind of her obligation as your mother. Sounds accurate. Despite all of that ... she really does love us. We just have to get used to her ways, her rules. She was wrong about Brian. Yeah. I think she knows that now. Don't you think she should apologize? My mother? That's one of her ways you have to get used to. She'll.. ahh ... take care of Brian in her own way. Now ... school tomorrow. Let's hit the hay. Did you meet any cute boys in school? In this town? Give me a break. How many? A couple. Maybe three. Can I help you? I'm looking for Mrs. Helen Royce. She's not in. Do you have any idea what time she'll be back? Maybe I can help, I live next door. It's personal. I really need to talk to her. She's in the hospital. ICU. - You know what caused this? Yes. We rarely see cases like this anymore. No antibodies inoculations, but that's what she's got and ... the antibiotics don't seem to be helping much. - But where did the tetanus come from? The infected finger she ... cut it on an old lamp. Do you know anything about an old brass lamp that Mrs. Royce purchased last week? Well, I was with her when she bought it. Is it ... Is it in her house? No, she sent it to her sister in California. Do you know her sister's name? And her phone number, but I've been trying to contact her for days to let her know about Helen. No one answers. Doctor Reeves, please see the nutrition ... Let me have her phone number. Hi. Hi. That's Brian's favourite. Yes, I know. Can I help? - Sure. Hello? Hello? Oh, that's the third time today. And I've got to get the phone company out here. I'll try again later. Hi. We're electric. Hi. Come in. Hi Danny. Oh, where's your dad? He said to come by and get the appliances and take them back to the shop. Oh, well, the chainsaw is in the basement and the kettle's in the kitchen. Danny, this is Mrs. Leacock's granddaughter Amanda. Amanda this is Danny Read. - Hi. - Hi. So, where can I find the chainsaw? Oh, would you show him the basement? Sure. Oh, hi Mrs. Leacock. - Oh, hello Danny. That, that kettle you want is right here. Oh, okay. I'll go get the chainsaw first. There's the basement. Danny, before you go ... Mrs. Leacock, do you think that lamp needs any more time in the living room? All right. Store it. Oh, thank you. Danny, would you lend me a hand, please? Sure. Amanda, would you be a dear and clean up this mess for me? I feel I need a nap before dinner. Sure. - Thank you. Easy now. Be careful around that corner. There. That's got it. There. I see why you wanna store this sucker. It's a definite floor bagger. I know how you feel. Mean ugly. - You've got taste. Careful, that door is jammed. Good. Good. Oh. This is it. Heavy son of a gun. You wanna plug it in, Peggy? Oh, no. Never mind. I think there's something wrong with it anyway. - Really? So, I'll hang onto it. Hey, I know I can get a few bucks for this down at the junk yard. Will you just give me a couple of weeks for Mrs. Leacock to forget it and I would gladly give it to you. All right, you got a deal. What do you think of Amanda, huh? - Well, she's cute. Well, she doesn't know very many people here, you know. Hey. Have a problem? - Something's jamming the blades. - Here, take your hand out. You know, you shouldn't mess with the disposal unless you secure the switch. I've seen you at school. You're senior? Yeah. And you're junior, right? Where're you from? San Francisco. Hmm, big city, huh? - Yeah. So, is there anything to do around here? Bowling. Bowling's okay. Yeah. It's definitely got something jammed down here. Mom ... They've stopped the bleeding. He'll live. I just don't understand what's happening around here. How can machines turned on by themselves? It's just not possible. There has to be a logical explanation. Mr. Read said he'll be here first in the morning. I'm sure he'll understand it. Okay, in the meantime we shouldn't use any electrical appliances. I've already told the kids. Hello? Hello? Hello! Father Kibbler, she's awake. Helen ... This is Father Kibbler. Oh, my god. I'm highly sorry ... for having offended thee ... May he adjust my sins ... Get the nurse! Saints of God, come to hear it. Come to meet her for support. Receive her spirit ... and present her to God the most high. So, I sent a telegram to her sister. But I doubt she'll get it. - It's possible this woman is away on a vacation somewhere. Well, I hope to God she is. And that lamp is sitting in a warehouse somewhere. - But what if it isn't? What if that woman is in great danger right this minute? We could contact the police, ask them to visit the house. On what bases? A satanic force is taking possession of a lamp? You want to go, is that it? I have to go. Monsignor won't allow it. Not after what happened to you at Amityville. You should already be on your way back to the monastery. And hide? That's what I've been doing for the past ten years, Father. That's why I left. It's safe there and it's easy and it keeps me from participating in life. You don't expect me to go running back there at the first sign of trouble, do you? This isn't trouble, Dennis. This is torment, I've been through it. That's all right. But from the seminary to now, this is the only experience I've had that I can offer to anyone. And I think Alice Leacock may need it. What do you want from me? Help me convince the Monsignor. Thank you. It's almost eleven o'clock on the West Coast. May I use your phone to try to call them again? - Yeah, go ahead. Still no answer. Hello? Hello? Stay away from me. My god. ... A lot of people could have died today. Since things got all messed up like from ghost. And Brian ... ... he was down in the basement and he was playing with the chainsaw. And then he started cutting up everything. And everybody said that he did it on purpose. But he knows he didn't. And mom said he didn't also. And all this stuff, this weird stuff that's been happening, Peggy realized ... she had to stop it somehow, so Peggy held up the pipe and you know, it burnt up the chainsaw. And everything here has been happening like it never ever did before. Jessie? Look mommy, it's daddy. Come on, Jessie. It's daddy. Come on, let's go to bed. - No. Come on, Jessie. - No! Jessie, come on! - No! Jessie, stop pissing me off. - No! Jessie ... - No! - ... let's go to bed! - No! Leave me alone! No! Daddy! No! No! - Jessie. - Daddy! Daddy! Mom? Daddy! Daddy! - Come on, Jessie. Please. Daddy! - Amanda! Get up there and turn off that lamp! Jessie, please. - No. Help me! Daddy! Daddy! No! Nancy. Thanks, mom. I want that attic door locked. So, she can't get up there again. - What was she doing up there? She thinks she was talking to her father. Mom ... It's that lamp. There is something about it that pulls her to do it. Nancy, it's just an old lamp. I know what it is. It's what she thinks it is that worries me. Well, I'll call doctor Brick and have him come to see her in the morning. I want her seen her by a psychiatrist. I think that Dr. Brick is qualified to make that decision. I pray this will turn out to be a wasted trip. Let's hope so. Well, thanks for your support, Father. Go with God. Well, seems perfectly normal. Could some kind of power surge've done it? Nah. Not flick a switch. It's a mechanical action. The only thing I can figure is Danny ... must have made a mistake and ... and taped the switch while it was in the on position. Oh, would you get that, Brian, please? - Yeah, sure. How could Danny make that kind of mistake? Well, it's an old switch. The on and off markings are worn. I'll check the fuse box. Hi. - Hi. Telegram here for Mrs. Alice Leacock. - I'll take it. Sign here, please. Line one. There you go. Bye bye. Brian? I can't find my black t-shirt. Is it in your closet? - I don't know. Well, I wanna wear it. Hey, don't go to my closet. I'll look for it. She still has a slight fever. It wouldn't hurt to keep her home for rest of the week. What about those nightmares? Well ... I'm not a psychiatrist. But considering the emotional drama she's been through. Add to that, a fever brought on by some sort of flu bug. It's not uncommon to manifest itself, into some sort of temporary delusion or hallucination. Temporary? I think so. Let's see what happens when the fever's gone. In the meantime ... Do try to keep yourself calm. If you're emotionally upset, it only adds to her instability. Thank you for coming, doctor. - Okay. Anytime. Just give a call. Bye Alice. - Goodbye, doctor. Feeling better? - Yeah. Mom, I'll be late. Brian, you're right. Call your sister. Amanda! Amanda! In a minute! Mom! Mrs. Leacock! What's go ... Mom! Oh, what is it? - I don't know. Look, this is the craziest . - Wait, turn it off. - No, no, no, let it run. We'll see if it clears up. - It smells like a sewer. It's the same upstairs. Sink and toilet. Has someone been fooling with the water pipes? - How can this happen? - Hmm, big stain. I think, you better get a plumber out here. - Well, how can I afford all that? I'm not made of money. I lived here for forty five years and never had what's been happening here the last three days. Since the kids and I moved in. I didn't say that. That's what three days means. I don't need half my words interpreted for me. - Hey, it's clearing up. I'll check upstairs. You better get in the car or we're gonna be late. Well, I checked the wiring and the fuse box, Mrs. Leacock and I can't find anything wrong. Of course not. That would be too easy, wouldn't it? I hope you don't mind me leaving you alone like this, but ... I made this commitment weeks ago. - Oh, you need some time away from here. Just be back by six, it's my bingo time. Oh, I'll be back in plenty of time. And you better get Jessica some lunch. Will you take care of the plumber for me? Oh, sure. Sure. Oh, there it is. Peggy! Somebody help me! Help! God! Danny? You need anything? Here we are, Jessica. Jessica! Jessica? You in there? Jessica? You in here? What? What? Hello. Hello. I've come to see Mrs. Leacock. Come in. Is she in? - Somewhere. Come in. I'm sorry, I'll have to come back later. Come in and sit down. No, I have to go. Mom? How can you defend her? You heard her this morning. She really believes that's us doing all that stuff to her precious house. She doesn't know what she's saying. She's just ... floundering. I think we should just leave. And go where? We don't have that luxury. What we're doing is the best I can do. And if that means putting up with the cranky grandmother then that's what you have to do. So, why don't we all just stop belly aching about that, okay? These are not for grandma. Then don't read it. But it's weird, mom. Listen. I'm a priest, who was a friend of your sister Helen. I must speak to you about the lamp she sent. It is extremely urgent. I'm staying at the Roadside Inn. Don't try to telephone. Come and see me, please. Father Kibbler. Don't try to telephone? Why would a priest be calling about a lamp? Maybe grandma can figure it out. Hi, hon. You feeling better? Yes. Good. Where's grandma? She went out. Let's see what we have here. Jessica, why are you doing pictures like this? I like it. Where's Peggy? Does she know what you're doing in here? She went home. What do you mean she went home? She wouldn't go home and leave you alone. She went home. Brian, go upstairs and see if Peggy's up there. Peggy? Hi grandma. Peggy! - What's all the fuss? Jessica says that Peggy went home. Why? Why? That's what I'd like to know. How could she leave her alone? - Oh, she must be here. Peggy? If she's done this to Jessica ... - Oh, stop it, Nancy. Peggy would never do a thing like that and you know it. What's all the shouting about? Jessica says that Peggy went home. Her coat is in the closet. Check all the rooms. Call Brian. - I'll go check the back. Why'd you tell me Peggy went home? Jessica, look at me. Mom! Come here! Hurry! Mom! Who did this!? Go, call the police. Find Peggy. My god. Mom, if you say Jessica is responsible for this, I'll hate you. Somebody's broken into our house! Send the police. Jessica ... What happened to your room? What happened to your room?! Was somebody here? Did someone come to visit? A man came. He came inside? Did the man come in the house?! No. He went away. Did he talk to Peggy? Peggy went home. - She didn't go home. Her coat is still in the closet. Who told you she went home? Daddy. - No! No, no, no ... Peggy. Peggy? Okay boys. Doesn't seem to be much doubt these were done by the same person. And you say you saw your daughter draw this? What about the destruction? Look at this room. Jessica couldn't have done this! I don't think so, Mrs. Evans. Don't you? Really? No, I don't. Ray. Body's on the way to the morgue. - So, what's the verdict? Looks like a heart attack. Peggy was a mighty duck. - And in good health. I did a physical on her not more than six months ago. Unfortunately, has no guarantee when it comes to coronary thrombosis. I'll do an autopsy, but I bet money on a heart attack. Did you noticed her knuckles? Blood and tissue on the door. I suspect she'd been pounding on it for some time. Which indicate she had some strength. Why didn't she open the door? Confusion maybe. Or maybe the door was locked. - No, no it wasn't. My grandson found it unlocked. Your daughter wouldn't have been playing with the locks, would she? No. And she didn't hear Peggy pounding on the door? She thought Peggy went home. What made her think that? Do you mind if I have a chat with her? Not tonight. She's still weak from the flu and this's been too much stress for her. I understand. Can I come by in the morning? That'll be fine. What they say? She had a heart attack. I've to go out for a little while. Now? It's just for a little while, I have to meet someone. As soon as the policeman's gone I want you to take Jessica up to Amanda's room. Amanda, you stay with her. Don't let her out of your sight. What's wrong with her, mom? I don't know. What did doctor Brick say? He doesn't know either. I'll take her into the city tomorrow. We'll see a specialist. Right now I need you to take care of her. Okay? Brian, I want you to go upstairs and lock that attic door. Hide the key. I do not want Jessica in that room. Understand? Yeah. I'll be back as soon as I can, okay? Brian? Oh, mom told me to lock the door, but the light was still on in there. What light? Thought the light was still on. Where is your mom? She had a meeting. - A meeting? Where? I don't know, she didn't say. I'll take the key. Now, off to bed. Father Kibbler? - Mrs. Leacock. No, I'm her daughter. Please ... sit down. Have you seen my aunt Helen? My mother's very concerned. She wasn't able to make contact with her. Your aunt ... passed away yesterday. Obviously you never received my telegram. My telegram ... I don't know what else should surprise me. How? What happened to her? - Tetanus. She cut her finger on the lamp ... that she sent to your mother. What entered into that lamp was three centuries of evil. That's the power it holds. That's the power that's invading your house right now. This all seem so crazy. That evil is searching for souls. And it would transmigrate into the most vulnerable person in it's environment. We have to get everyone out of that house, now. What if it's too late? What if it's already ... invaded the person? My daughter Jessica. She terrifies me. Father, her behaviour. She believes that her father speaks to her through that lamp. She sees him? She thinks so. I know it's just a hallucination. - No. No, that ... That's the devil's disguise. He'll appear in ... .. in the most seductive form necessary to get what he wants. Pepper, did you get yourself stuck up there? Come on, kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty. Come on. Come on, Pepper. Come on, girl. Kitty, kitty, kitty. Come on, Pepper. It knows I'm coming. Knows? I can feel it. Is it afraid of you? If it was afraid of me, it would never allow you to be with me. It wants me. Father, you're scaring the hell out of me. Why are you coming into this house? I went to the other house and I defeated it. - No. There were six of you. And even then you barely survived it. Do you know something different this time? Do you have some new power? New ammunition? Holy water. When we get there ... you stay in the car, keep the motor running. I'll go in and get everybody up fast. Then we'll just keep driving. Jess ... Where're you going? You're supposed to stay in Amanda's room. - She's sleeping. Jess, mom said you have to stay in there. Daddy wants me. Jessica, Jessica. - No! Daddy wants me! Amanda, help me! - Daddy! Let me go! Daddy! Jessie! Mom! It's Brian. Mom! Mom, Jessica is in the attic.

Mom? -I can't open the door. - I'll get it. Mom! Mom! Mom! - How did you cut it? - It was an accident. The window fell on me. I'm okay. - I told you to stay out of the house! - Oh, what's happening here? Who is this man? - I'm a friend. We're gonna have to break this door. Do you have an axe? - There's one in the basement, but ... - Go, get it! - Go! Okay, Get out of the house, I want you safe. All right, I'll get her out of the house. Show me where the basement is.
