Did you come back here again? You have some big nephews there, uncle Costel. It seems like only yesterday they were as big as a needle. Well, they grow up, the little devils. You kind of forgot it. - I did. The chicken, it speaks. What's up? I thought you'd never show up. Yo, Sausage, didn't i tell you not to come here alone? I'll tell mama that you're smoking! And I'll tell her you asked me for a cigarette and I didn't give you any. Stupid bitch! Uncle Costel, what have you planted here? This and that... Some tomatoes, some cucumbers... Things that everybody grows. It went to hell... - Where did it go? Andrei, you little bugger! Who's your favorite uncle? You are, uncle Costel. Come on, get a cigarette for your favorite uncle. They're all gone. Come on, bro, here come the peaches. I like the one with big tits, that bitch is hot. The one in the blue dress and boots is not bad either What about that one, isn't she nice? Check out the legs on that one! They are so fit, man... Check out the one in the short skirt. Yeah, she's fucking hot. She is super-fucking-freakin' hot! Look at them sexy legs. They're gross. Marilena is the hottest, then... I'll leave you with those peaches. Go ahead, you don't belong here anyway. Andrei likes that girl with orange hair. No shit! Now you know what I like. Cut the crap.

Look at the skirt big tits is wearing. But the curly one... oh man! What a ride on him! - I bet he'll get the best chick. It's that slick Giani. What are you talking about? The Blond can take him down with one hand! Does not. - Are you looking for trouble or what? Sit down or they'll see us. How are the little peaches? - I don't know what's in your head. You wouldn't wanna know what's in my head. Wanna go for a ride? I don't know. Let's see... - See what? Come on. Wanna go for a ride? I don't know, talk to the boss. What's up? If i had one of them fancy cars, I'd take that cool chick in black... and i'd bang her like that. If i had a car like his I'd take that bitch with the curly hair. I'd fuck her good and proper! That curly has some schemes that drive you nuts, bro. Give me a break. I like that Elena. Go play with your dick in the sand, or we'll turn you in, to the pros. Hey, big teeth, did anyone ask you? The fat one is on the hustle. Look at the tits on this one. - These ones are gonna do it. It's gonna get crowded in there. - Look at the old hag. She knows her shit. - Chill out, granny!

Come on, Nicu, my stew is on the stove. Come on, love, I'm watching TV. Good evening, and all the best, my dears. The mating season started for the Memestra Brassicelli butterflies this week. You look very pretty like this. You don't say. Do you really think so? Yup, I like those little ears. What? I think it was like a short circuit. It's because of me. It happens to me every now and then. You? Come on... I swear. Don't you tell me you're one of those with weird energies. Where are your girlfriends? - What girlfriends? I don't know. Those girls you fancy talk with those schemes. I have no girls. What got into you? I can't belive you don't have some pussy at home. I don't, but look at this little cock here, all for you. Nicu, are you listening to me? Why don't you take care of the kid's education? Look at him, doing that thing in our home, in my home! Don't you have toys to play with? How can you do such a thing? You taught him to drive the trolleybus... Like that's education! I want him to go to university and you teach him to drive the trolleybus. You jerk, go to your room! You're not going anywhere, to start doing that thing again. Go outside and do 20 push-ups, till your guts spill out. Move it! Get this crap out of your head. You even ruined my meat and jelly. Come on, Nicu, say something. What? You're feeling guilty, huh? If I catch you with these magasines in my home again, for the kids to see them, I don't know what I'll do to you... And tell me what you do with your salary! Why don't you bring it home? Where is the money? Don't make me go to the depot and see how much you earn! Or do you have a weetheart? - I told you before I'm not seeing anyone. - Then what do you do? 'Cause you don't do anything to me, for quite some time now... Maybe the kid is taking after you. You assholes. Jerk-offs! Listen, do you mind if i drop you here 'cause i have some things to do. You're a princess. Come on bitch, wanna fuck? Suck my dick, bitch! Hold it, kid, there's no need to worry. There's nothing wrong with that. But your daddy asked me to talk to you. OK? Well, son, it's tough with the girls. All they want is money, and then more money. How much money? - A lot, a lot... So if you have the money, they stay with you? Well, just a while, 'till they eat it up and then they look for another sucker. They eat it up?! - I mean they spend it on crap. Listen... Do you have a girl? Do you think i have any money, kid? None of them want me. To hell with them bitches! So... I guess you need a car, right? A car, and a home. Well... I have a home. - You don't. Your father does. You think your mom would stay if your dad had no home? She's be long gone, what the hell. Mom loves dad. Did you see that? Listen to him Mom! Dad! Where are you going? Tell me where you're going! I have some stuff to do, okay? - I'm coming with you! You can't come. I'm busy. What's up, little dick? Got something on your mind? What? And what do you want me to do? - Hey, bro, this is not good, i gave you the money. Listen: I'll give you half the money... I was wrong. Take half the money, take your toy too, and go home. What's up with him? Huh? What are you doing here? Get the hell out of here, you pedophile! Move it! So the girls don't want? - Want what? Money. - What money? Wanna spend it? Fried meatballs, sausages, Hello, miss. What's the deal? Going in without ordering? We'll order boss, when we get out. - Nice pussy. I'll wait outside.
