We are now obviously ready to go. I'm Howard Stringer, and as president of C.B.S. Entertainment, it is my singular pleasure, and a great moment for us to be able to bring this great star to C.B.S.: David Letterman. ( people applauding ) I never dated Amy Fisher. I... I... I... I fixed her car, I helped her with her homework, and, that's all. All right, thank you. All right, I'll take some questions, and then, uh, Colin Powell will be in here and update you on the bombing. ( all laughing ) I do want to thank C.B.S. for their... for their support, and... and, of course, for their generosity. I mean, wow, this is a deal that would put a smile on Jack Benny's face, and that's in the condition he's in right now. ( all laughing ) Does G.E. make the best managers for a television network? ( coughing ) ( all laughing ) What was the question? Oh, yeah. No, you know, I don't know about that, but they make a darn fine toaster oven. ( all laughing ) Come on, Paul, we got... we got to do a show. Dave, I have a terrible case of the hiccups. Oh, really? You tried holding your breath? Everything. ( hiccupping ) I got an idea. Hold on. What are you doing? Here just put that on your head there, ( hiccupping ) and breathe... breathe normally there, Paul. Ok. I'm breathin'. How is that? You, uh, feel any better? ( hiccupping ) Oh, gosh. ( hiccupping ) Sorry... Must have been something I ate. IT'S BLOODY MARVELOUS. ( announcer on T.V. ) The Tonight Show. Johnny's guest host tonight is Jay Leno. Ladies and gentlemen, Jay Leno! ( band playing on T.V. ) Thank you. Wonderful, wonderful. That's nice to hear. Now, did you all see the paper? There's a survey that says you're safer, and now this is true, you're safer on an airplane than you are in your own bathroom. Do you believe that? I mean, do you... do you think that's true? I don't know. I've never slipped on the toilet seat and fallen 35,000 feet. ( both laughing ) You know, I mean, I never adjusted the shower rod and had a fireball come out and incinerate me. So you can't imagine... SO, WHY CAN'T WE JUS THROW MONEY AT ONE OF THEM? WHAT SORT OF OFFER DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? WHAT DOES IT MATTER? LATE NIGHT'S MAKING $70 MILLION A YEAR FOR N.B.C. WHERE'S OUR BLOODY PIECE? THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MR. SAJAK. OH, CHRIST, WHAT A DISASTER. HE'S GOT A LOCK ON EVERY BLUE-HAIRED OLD BIDDY WHO EVER WATCHED WHEEL OF FORTUNE. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY STATIONS ARE CANCELING HIM FOR ARSENIO? IT'S LIKE THEY'RE CANCELING HIM BEFORE WE CAN. LOOK AT THESE FUCKING NUMBERS WHEN LENO FILLS IN FOR CARSON. AND LETTERMAN. N.B.C. HAS HIM SIGNED THROUGH '93. WELL... WHAT ABOUT LENO? N.B.C. ONLY HAS A ONE-YEAR HOLDING DEAL WITH JAY. THAT'S NOTHING. HE COULD BE RIPE. SO LET'S STEAL HIM. I MEAN, WE CAN GIVE HIM A SHOW NOW FOR CHRIST'S SAKES. I'LL PUSH SAJAK OVER A CLIFF IF WE COULD GET LENO. THEY MIGHT FIGHT FOR HIM. LET THEM. THEY CAN'T FIGHT EQUALLY FOR LENO AND LETTERMAN. THEY'RE NOT GONNA OFFER THEM BOTH CARSON'S SPO WHEN HE RETIRES. THIS IS THE BES OPPORTUNITY WE'VE EVER HAD TO BREAK N.B.C.'S STRANGLEHOLD ON LATE NIGHT. OK, HOWARD. LET'S GO STIR SOMETHING UP. And, you know, we can knock it out in one fell swoop. Oh! OH! WHOA! WHOA! BOUNCY UP HERE. ( glass shattering ) WE GOT TO DO A COMMERCIAL HERE, BOYS AND GIRLS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE SANDRA BERNHARD. ( audience applauding ) ( band playing ) I'M HAVIN' A BLAST, THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK ON, DAVE. HOW YOU DOING? WHAT DO YOU WANT, THE NUMBER OF MY THERAPIST? YOU SHOULD BE THRILLED WITH YOUR LIFE. THERE YOU GO. IT WASN'T THAT BAD, DAVE. OK, WE HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE, BUT SANDRA WAS GOOD AND YOU WERE GOOD WITH HER. NO, I SUCKED, MORTY. AND THE WHOLE SHOW SUCKED BECAUSE I SUCKED. I DON'T... I DON'T BELONG IN NETWORK TELEVISION. I BELONG IN THE MUNCIE, DRIVING GRAVEL. YOU GOT GREAT LAUGHS. OH, BULLSHIT. IF THAT AUDIENCE WERE ANY DEADER, THERE'D BE GUYS IN LAB COATS GOING THROUGH HARVESTING ORGANS. THOSE DORKS AT N.B.C. PROBABLY STEERED UP THE CROWD WAITING IN LINE FOR DONAHUE BY MISTAKE. IT'S THEIR WAY OF SENDING A MESSAGE. WHAT MESSAGE? THE MESSAGE. LIKE GIVING JAY THE JOB AS PERMANEN GUEST HOST FOR JOHNNY. THEY DIDN'T DO THAT TO MESS WITH YOU. THEY DO EVERYTHING TO MESS WITH ME. LIKE RENTING OUT OUR STUDIO IN THE MORNING TO MAURY POVICH. LAURIE, I NEED SOME COFFEE. GREAT SHOW. YEAH. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WH-WH-WHEN ARE... WHEN ARE WE SUPPOSED TO REHEARSE? SHOULD I MOVE MY CAMERA AROUND SOME BALD WOMEN WITH EATING DISORDERS? WE WON'T LE THAT HAPPEN, DAVE. WE'LL DO SOMETHING. GOSH, MORTY, I KNOW, WE COULD BOYCOTT THE SHOW. THEY'LL PROBABLY USE THA AS AN EXCUSE TO FIRE ME. OH, COME ON, DAVE. I FUCKED UP NUMBER 6... NO, YOU DIDN'T. IT WAS THE ONLY DECENT JOKE IN THE WHOLE FUCKING SHOW... IT WAS FUNNY. IT WAS FUNNY, I WASN'T. LET ME SEE THE TAPE. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BREATHER? GIVE ME THE FUCKING TAPE. ( sighing ) FUCK. ( David ) OH, MAN. FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. JESUS, DO I SUCK! OH, OH, THAT'S GOOD. I SHOULD'VE JUMPED IN RIGHT THERE! ( Helen ) LISTEN, YOU CHEAP, FUCKING BASTARD, IT'S ONE LOUSY TABLE, $10,000. THAT'S CHUMP CHANGE. ( man ) That's extortion, Helen. WHAT? IT'S NOT EXTORTION, IT'S CHARITY, FOR GOD'S SAKE. IT'S FOR PEDIATRIC AIDS. YOU SELFISH PRICK. Don't flatter me. SWEETIE. Put me down for 2. WHAT? 2 tables. YOU ARE SUCH A MENSCH. Helen, do you still love me? ( laughing ) YES, I STILL LOVE YOU. SEE, THAT DIDN' HURT VERY BAD. When are we gonna have dinner, honey? I... I GOTTA GO. I GOTTA GO, JAY'S HERE. BYE. ( laughing ) HOW YOU DOIN'? HERE'S YOUR TICKETS. WHERE AM I GOING THIS TIME? COME, I'LL WALK YOU TO THE CAR. OK. THAT'S MINE. I GOT TO KNOW MY FUTURE. I KNOW YOUR FUTURE, FOLLOW ME. YOU'RE PLAYING JOE LAFFS IN GREEN BAY, FRIDAY. THE N.B.C. AFFILIATE IS W.L.U.K. GOOD LUCK, HUH? I'M GETTING YOU IN JUST IN TIME TO DO THE NOON NEWS. OH, YEAH, THAT'S GOOD, I-I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHIN' THE NOON NEWS IN GREEN BAY. THOSE LOCAL STATIONS ARE GONNA GET YOU THE TONIGHT SHOW. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. LOOK AT THIS. NOT ANOTHER GODDAMN MOTORCYCLE, I DON'T HAVE THE TIME. HELEN, HELEN, HOLD ON. TAKE A SECOND. LOOK AT THIS MOTORCYCLE. "TO J.L. CRANK IT ON UP AND RIDE OVER TO C.B.S. FOREVER." IT'S A RARE BIKE. ANY IDEA WHAT THIS COST THEM? NO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COST, BUT I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. HI. HELLO. TABLE FOR 2? PLEASE. ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE PLACE FOR A GOOD CORNED BEEF SANDWICH? YEAH. SHE WANTED DISCREET. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY FROM N.B.C. WILL BE DROP... OH, JESUS. WHAT? ARNIE KLEINER FROM PARAMOUN JUST WALKED IN WITH SOME OTHER GUY. WILL THEY KNOW HELEN? HERE SHE COMES. YOU SAID WE'D HAVE PRIVACY HERE. I JUST SAW ARNIE KLEINER IN THE CORNER DOWNING A THAI BEER. OH, MY GOD, HOWARD STRINGER. ( laughing ) RIGHT. A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, HELEN. ROD SAID WE'D JUST TALK A LITTLE BUSINESS OVER LUNCH. THIS LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE MORE THAN LUNCH. OH, OF COURSE IT IS. WE WOULDN'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR VALUED TIME. ALL RIGHT. NOW, WE THINK THE WORLD OF JAY. WE'VE NOTICED WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING FILLING IN FOR CARSON, AND WE THINK HE'S READY TO BE A STAR, RIGHT NOW. AND WE HAVE SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE CAN OFFER HIM. 11:30 WIDE OPEN. HOLY SHIT. A DEAL MEMO ALREADY? YOU GUYS ARE SERIOUS. YOU... YOU TAKE THIS, I DON'T... I DON'T WANT TO HOLD ONTO THIS. YOU CAN GIVE JAY THE DETAILS WITHOUT THE PAPER IF YOU PREFER. THE SHOW OPENS IN SEPTEMBER. HE'LL GET $6 MILLION TO START. HOW DOES THAT SOUND? $6 MILLION. YEAH, ALL RIGHT, I'M IMPRESSED, BUT, UH, WE MAY BE RUSHING THIS A LITTLE BIT. JAY'S A LOYAL PUPPY. HE'S GOT A THING FOR THE TONIGHT SHOW, LIKE EVERY OTHER COMIC IN AMERICA. OF COURSE. BUT ISN'T HE STILL THIRD IN THAT LINE, BEHIND CARSON AND LETTERMAN? ( laughing ) NO, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT. BUT I WOULD SAY THA WE HAVE SOME REASON TO FEEL A LITTLE, UH, IMPATIENT WITH WHERE WE ARE. AND, UM, I'LL ADMIT I TO YOU, HOWARD, I LOVE THIS OFFER. I'M SURE YOU DO, HELEN. ( all laughing ) COMPLIMENTS OF MR. KLEINER. ( all chattering ) THIS FEELS LIKE THE LATE-NIGHT D.M.Z. DOES THAT MAKE ME NIXON? I GUESS I'M KISSINGER. YEAH, YEAH. WITH YOU NEGOTIATING, THAT WAR WOULD'VE GONE NUCLEAR. AT LEAST IN THIS WAR WE CONTROL ALL THE WEAPONS. OH, YEAH. WE HOPE. HI, BRANDON. HEY, MORT, HOW YOU DOING? GOOD TO SEE YOU. ENJOY THE EVENING. HEY, WARREN, WE GOT HOWARD STRINGER HUMPING LENO'S LEG. WHAT ARE WE GONNA TELL THE G.E. GUYS IF WE LOSE HIM? MY DOG ATE MY LATE NIGHT HOST? I MAY. I MAY. HELEN NEEDS A STROKING. JAY, I HEAR HOWARD STRINGER WANTS TO TAKE YOU TO BERMUDA FOR A ROMANTIC WEEKEND. ( all laughing ) HELEN. HI, HOW ARE YOU? FINE. JAY, HONEY, IT'S TIME TO GO GET YOUR MAKEUP ON. YOUR SPOT STARTS IN 30 MINUTES. MANAGER AND NETWORK NEED TO BE ALONE, I CAN TAKE A HINT. HEY, UH, BRANDON, WATCH YOUR WALLET. ( laughing ) HEY, DAVID. OH, HEY. HEY, JAY, HOW YOU DOING? HOW YOU DOING? GOOD. WHAT'S GOING ON? LISTEN, HOW'S N.B.C. TREATIN' YOU? GOOD, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, WHO KNOWS? OK, I GUESS. HEY, I SAW THAT SHOW THE OTHER DAY WITH SANDRA BERNHARD. OH, JESUS. IT WAS GREAT, COME ON. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, IT WAS SO FUNNY. I KNOW MORTY'S DOWN THERE, I WANT TO TALK TO MORTY. HEY, ARE YOU GUYS GONNA STAY AROUND? YOU GONNA GO BACK? UH, NO, WE... WE GOT TO TAKE THE REDEYE BACK. I HATE THE REDEYE. LISTEN, YOU KNOW, JAY, WELL, I'LL HAVE MORTY CALL YOU, WE'LL BOOK YOU ON THE SHOW WHEN YOU'RE NO FILLING IN FOR JOHNNY. YEAH, WHATEVER. GOOD. YOU KNOW ME, I'M READY, AS LONG AS IT'S OK WITH HELEN. AH, RIGHT, OF COURSE. WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'LL HAVE MORTY CALL HELEN, AND DO IT THAT WAY. ALL RIGHT. I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, DAVE. ALL RIGHT. OH, LISTEN, JAY, CALL MORTY, ALL RIGHT? YEAH, TELL HIM TO CALL HELEN. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. GOOD TO SEE YOU. I GOT TO TELL YOU, I GOT A HELL OF AN OFFER FROM C.B.S. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, JAY WANTS TO STAY AND TAKE OVER WHEN CARSON STEPS DOWN, BUT, BRANDON, I NEED A COMMITMENT. HELEN, YOU'RE AS SUBTLE AS A KNEE TO THE GROIN. I DIDN'T HEAR THE WORDS TONIGHT SHOW IN THERE ANYWHERE. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU WANT US TO BOUNCE JOHNNY NOW? YOU WANT TO DEPRIVE HIM OF REACHING HIS 30TH ANNIVERSARY? JUST LOOKING TO PROTECT MY GUY. LOOK AT HER WORKING BRANDON. IS SHE SHAMELESS OR WHAT? DAVID, I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY YOU SHOULDN'T SAY HELLO TO BRANDON. OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE. NOW'S YOUR CHANCE TO LET SOMEBODY KNOW YOU WANT THE TONIGHT SHOW. LET'S WAVE HIM OVER. WAVE HIM. JESUS. YOU DON'T WAVE HEADS OF NETWORKS. YOU SHOULD WAVE WAITERS AND HOOKERS AND, UH... BRANDON. GOOD LORD, HOW CAN A TELEVISION SHOW BE WORTH THIS MUCH EMBARRASSMENT? HEY, DAVID. HEY, BRANDON, HOW YOU DOING? DAVID, I THINK I HEARD THEM CALL YOUR CATEGORY, BUT DON'T WORRY, LITTLEFIELD RAN IN TO ACCEPT FOR YOU. JOHNNY SENDS HIS REGARDS. OH, THANK YOU. TOO BAD HE COULDN'T COME, THEN I COULD'VE BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED WITH ALL OUR LATE NIGHT STARS BEFORE THEY ALL STAR FILING FOR FREE AGENCY. ( all chuckling ) DAVID, I, UH... I KNOW YOU WAN THE JOB AS MUCH AS JAY. LISTEN, BRANDON, I'M NO CAMPAIGNING FOR ANYTHING. I'M NOT... I'M NOT SAYING YOU ARE. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE HAVEN' FORGOTTEN YOU. WELL, THAT'S, UH... THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. THANKS. SURE. I WAS IN... I WAS IN NEW YORK IN JULY, AND I STOPPED BY TO SEE YOU, BUT LAURIE SAID YOU WERE IN REHEARSAL... YEAH, NO, ACTUALLY, I WAS LOCKED IN MY OFFICE, SOBBING. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. I'LL TRY NOT TO BE AN ANTISOCIAL JERK NEXT TIME. AND, BRANDON, LISTEN, I... I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. SURE, DAVE, GOOD LUCK. SEE YOU. OH, I FEEL LIKE A DADDY WHO'S JUST GOTTEN ALL HIS CHILDREN TO BED. ( Helen ) BRANDON, YOU SHIT. ( phone ringing ) WE HAVE TO TALK. HELEN, I'M RUNNING THROUGH A CONTRACT NEGOTIATION WITH THE GUYS FROM CHEERS... LISTEN, LISTEN, I'VE HAD I WITH THIS RUNAROUND. YOU DON'T GET BY WITH VERBAL ASSURANCES ANYMORE. SEE, I HAD A VERBAL COMMITMEN FROM BRANDON A YEAR AGO, NOW HE'S GONE TO PARAMOUNT. YOU I'M NOT SO FOND OF, JOHN, NO OFFENSE. YOU THINK YOU CAN PULL THE SAME MANIPULATIVE SHI WITH ME YOU TRY ON EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS TOWN. BUT YOU FUCK WITH ME AND I'LL FUCK YOU BACK GOOD. SEE, I DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT WITH YOU. I CAN MOVE JAY TO C.B.S. WITHIN A MONTH. THAT WOULD LEAVE YOU WITH CARSON AND HIS RETIREMEN HOME AUDIENCE. SO LET'S CUT THE SHIT, SHALL WE? THIS HAS JUST BEEN A BUSY PERIOD. COME ON, THESE THINGS TAKE TIME. YOU'RE NOT LISTENING, ASSHOLE. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT TIME, I WANT A PIECE OF PAPER. I DON'T KNOW WHEN CARSON IS GONNA GE THE FUCKING MESSAGE AND QUIT. I WANT JAY SIGNED. HELEN, I HEAR YOU. BELIEVE ME. LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO. GIVE ME ONE WEEK? A WEEK'S 7 DAYS, JOHN. TRUST ME, I CAN COUNT. RIGHT. ( car horns honking ) ( people chattering ) ( man ) TAXI! JESUS CHRIST. OH, MAN! HEY, MORTY. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS? JESUS CHRIST. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? FROM WHAT I CAN TELL, THERE'S NO SOURCE FOR IT. MY GOD. WH-WH-WHAT'S THIS MEAN NOW, MORTY? IT MEANS NOTHING. IT MEANS HELEN GOT ON THE PHONE. I MEAN, THIS HAS TO BE HELEN. YEAH, BUT WOULD N.B.C. TREAT JOHNNY THIS WAY? THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED IF BRANDON HADN' GONE TO PARAMOUNT. I MEAN, HE HAD SOME CONTROL. HELEN WOULDN'T PULL THIS SHI WHEN BRANDON WAS THERE. MAYBE... MAYBE... MAYBE THIS IS ALL N.B.C., THEIR WAY OF DEALING JAY IN. NO, DON'T ASSUME THESE ASSHOLES HAVE A PLAN. IT'S THE NEW YORK POST, FOR GOD'S SAKE. WHAT'S THAT MEAN? IT'S NOT N.B.C.'S STYLE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE HOW THESE GUYS, UH, WEASEL OUT OF THIS ONE. ( P.R. executive ) WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE RUMORS. "WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE RUMORS?" YOU HAVE TO CONTROL THE RUMORS. SO, HOW DO WE WORD THE RELEASE? MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TALK ABOU THE NETWORK'S HUGE DEBT TO JOHNNY. NO WORDS LIKE, "AND WE HOPE THE KING WILL REIGN FOR MANY YEARS TO COME?" NO. OK. HELEN'S WORK, RIGHT? WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT PROBABLY CAME FROM THE CARSON PEOPLE. THEY KNOW THEY'RE IN TROUBLE. THEY'RE TRYING TO SCREW YOU BY LEAKIN' A STORY. THEY WANNA MAKE YOU LOOK SO FUCKING EAGER YOU'LL DO ANYTHING TO GET THE JOB. I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE. YOU KNOW, I'M JUST... JUST WORRIED ABOUT JOHNNY. WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HIM FOR? HE DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT YOU. I MEAN, THAT'S THE PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK HE REALLY LIKES ME. THERE YOU GO WITH THA "LIKE" SHIT AGAIN. WHAT THE HELL DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? I MEAN, HE'S NOT PICKIN' HIS SUCCESSOR, N.B.C. IS. YOU DON'T THINK THEY'LL GIVE HIM A VOTE? NO, I DON'T. WOULD YOU LEAVE THE CAMPAIGNING TO ME? GO, DO YOUR FUCKING JOKES. I WANNA BE ABLE TO SWEAR TO JOHNNY THIS DIDN'T COME FROM US. SO GO AHEAD AND SWEAR. ( phone ringing ) ( Johnny ) Hello. JOHNNY, HEY, IT'S JAY. Jay? YEAH, HOW YOU DOIN'? I JUST WANTED TO... JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS ROTTEN ARTICLE IN THE POST. I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU THAT IT DIDN'T COME FROM US. Actually, you've been the G.E. employee of the week, haven't you there, Paul? Aw, gee, Dave, I guess I... I missed out on that one. ( audience laughing ) Uh, well, it's, uh, it's quite an honor, Paul. You know, kids, why don't we find out who... who the G.E. employee of the week is, uh, this week. Right here, on our show, we can reveal the name of the G.E. employee of the week. ( drum beating ) Anton, can we have a... Here we go. Uh, let's see who it is this week, huh, Paul. Warren Littlefield and John Agoglia. for cost consciousness far beyond... WELL, THIS IS THE REASON I WENT INTO TELEVISION. SO MY FAMILY CAN SEE ME BEING INSULTED IN FRONT OF 4 MILLION PEOPLE. HE'S GOT THE MICROPHONE, AND WE'RE HELPLESS. FORGET ABOUT IT. I'VE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH THESE RATINGS CHARTS YOU SENT ME. ( Warren ) SO... SO YOU KNOW HOW WELL JAY IS DOING. YEAH. PRIME-TIME REVENUES ARE NEXT TO NOTHING. I'M THINKING ABOUT ALL THE MONEY WE'VE GO RIDING ON LATE NIGHT. THE LAST THING WE NEED IS A PROBLEM THERE. WELL, WE'VE ALREADY GOT ONE. HELEN KUSHNICK, THE WOMAN'S FORCING THE ISSUE. SO FAR WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP HER IN LINE WITH VERBAL ASSURANCES: LENO'S IN LINE FOR THE TONIGHT SHOW. PLUS, WE'VE COMMITTED SERIOUS MONEY IF LENO DOESN'T GET THE SHOW, $2, $3 MILLION... BUT SHE'LL FORFEIT THE MONEY AND GO TO C.B.S. AND THAT COULD BE A DISASTER FOR US. WE'VE STILL GO CARSON AND LETTERMAN. A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT LENO IS THE HOTTEST TALEN IN TELEVISION. IT WOULD BE A MAJOR MISTAKE TO LOSE JAY NOW. ESPECIALLY SINCE JOHNNY DOESN'T HAVE THAT LONG TO GO. JOHN HAS NEVER SAID ONE WORD TO ME ABOUT QUITTING. IT MAY GET TO THE POIN WHERE WE CAN' WAIT ANY LONGER. YOU WANNA GET RID OF JOHNNY CARSON? HIS RATINGS ARE SOFTENING. ARSENIO'S GO THE YOUNGER VIEWERS. THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS. ( sighing ) WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THE FUTURE IS SECURE. IF WE GIVE JAY A FIRM DEAL NOW, GIVE HIM A CONTRAC THAT GUARANTEES HIM THE SHOW WHENEVER JOHNNY LEAVES, I THINK HE AND HELEN WOULD GO FOR IT. YEAH, BUT WHERE DOES THA LEAVE US WITH LETTERMAN? HE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE. WE'VE GOT HIM FOR 2 MORE YEARS. LETTERMAN'S NEVER ONCE ASKED US TO GUARANTEE HIM THE SHOW IF JOHNNY QUITS. DAVE IS STILL OUR 12:30 GUY. WE'LL MAKE SURE HE STAYS THERE. ALL WE NEED TO DO NOW IS GET JAY SIGNED, KEEP HIM OFF C.B.S. AND THIS SHOULD STAY BETWEEN US, HELEN, AND JAY. CARSON DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW, LETTERMAN DOESN' HAVE TO KNOW, IT NEVER MAKES THE PAPERS. THAT IS ESSENTIAL. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY WRITING THAT N.B.C. IS PUSHING JOHNNY CARSON OUT THE DOOR. I WANT THIS HANDLED VERY CAREFULLY. JOHN AND I ARE FRIENDS. BUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE LATE NIGHT LOCKED UP. IF THAT MEANS A DEAL FOR LENO, LET'S DO IT. ( siren wailing ) ( John ) JAY IS THE HOST, THE FIRST WEEK NIGH AFTER CARSON'S LAST SHOW. HELEN IS THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER. N.B.C. PRODUCTIONS OWNS THE SHOW. NOW, OF COURSE, NO WORD OF THIS LEAVES THIS ROOM. NO. NO. OH. HELEN GETS THIS FAT CHECK. I THINK, YOU COULD SAY THIS IS THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM COMING TRUE FOR 2 PEOPLE, HUH? OH, YEAH, I... I THINK, HELEN, THEY'VE GOT US WHERE THEY WANT US. WELL, YOU SEE, I WOULD'VE SAID I THE OTHER WAY AROUND. ( laughing ) ( car horns honking ) ( people chattering ) LET'S GIVE A BIG HAND FOR THE STARS OF OUR 1992 FALL LINEUP. WELL, YOU'VE... YOU'VE SEEN THE, UH, THE NEW PROGRAMS FOR OUR FALL SEASON, AND I... I HOPE OUR AFFILIATES AND OUR FRIENDS IN ADVERTISING COMMUNITY AGREE, WE'VE PUT NEW LIFE INTO PRIME TIME. AND NOW THE... THE LAST SURPRISE OF THE DAY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE KING OF LATE NIGHT TELEVISION SOON TO BEGIN HIS 30TH YEAR AT N.B.C... HERE'S JOHNNY. THANK YOU. THAT... THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU. GEE... GEE, WHAT A FAST-PACED AFTERNOON. ( all laughing ) YOU... YOU FOLKS MUST BE JUST SHORT OF A COMA. ( all laughing ) YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS GET A LITTLE AWESTRUCK TO THINK OF THE GREAT MEN WHO'VE GRACED THIS STAGE. JASCHA HEIFETZ, VLADIMIR HOROWITZ, AND TODAY, WARREN LITTLEFIELD. ( all laughing ) KIND OF KNOCKS THE HELL OUT OF DARWIN'S THEORY, DOESN'T IT? ( all laughing ) YOU KNOW, JAY LENO WHO'S NOW THE GUEST HOST ON OUR SHOW, IS DRIVING ME NUTS BACKSTAGE. "HOW'RE YOU FEELING? YOUR THYROID OK?" YOU KNOW, I LIKE JAY, AND HE IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MY HEALTH. IN FACT, HE SUGGESTED I TAKE A RUN THROUGH CENTRAL PARK ABOUT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. ( audience laughing ) ANYWAY, I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG AFTERNOON. I JUST WANNA SAY THIS IS THE LAST YEAR THAT I'M DOING THE TONIGHT SHOW. WHAT DID HE JUST SAY ABOU THIS BEING THE LAST YEAR? I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW. BUT MY LAST SHOW IS GONNA BE ONE YEAR FROM NOW, MAY 22, 1992. ( all exclaiming ) I JUST WANNA... I WANNA THANK YOU. I AM VERY GRATEFUL, AND I BID YOU GOODBYE. ( all applauding ) WHY... WHY DIDN'T YOU... THIS IS REAL. I JUST SAID IT, THE WORLD HEARD ME. IT'S REAL. GREAT TIE, BOB, TERRIFIC. ( audience chattering ) DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS, JOHN? MR. LITTLEFIELD, CAN I JUST ASK A QUESTION? I WOULD LIKE TO THANK... THANK YOU, UM, JOHNNY, AND THANK YOU FOR COMING. AND THE BATHROOMS ARE DOWN THE HALL AND TO THE RIGHT. ( reporters chattering ) WARREN, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? I HAD NO GOD DAMN IDEA... ( John ) WE HAVE NO RELEASE PREPARED, NOTHING. BETTY, WHY DON'T YOU... THE PRESS IS GONNA FRY US LIKE BACON STRIPS. OVER THE WORLD WITH OUR ASSES HANGING OUT. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD TO ME. WHO'S IT GONNA BE? WHO GETS THE TONIGHT SHOW? I'M NOT GONNA ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW. IS IT LENO OR LETTERMAN? COME ON, BETTY, WHO'S THE GUY FOR THE JOB? STAY TUNED, EVERYBODY. STAY TUNED. THANKS, BYE. MR. LENO? YEAH. THERE'S A PHONE CALL FOR YOU, SIR. I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE COURTESY PHONE. ALL RIGHT. EXCUSE ME, AREN'T YOU THE DORITOS GUY? JOHNNY ANNOUNCED HE WAS QUITTIN' TODAY. WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING? I... I WAS JUST WITH HIM. HE WENT ON LAST, LONG AFTER YOU'D GONE. He just dumped it on them. He said he was doing the show one more year and then out. DID THEY MAKE ANY KIND OF ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT US? NOTHIN'. I MEAN, THEY WERE TOO BUSY TRYING TO PULL UP THEIR PANTS. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'LL COME, THE DEAL IS SET. WE GOT IT, JAY. ONE MORE YEAR. HIS LAST SHOW IS MAY 22, OUR FIRST IS MAY 25, MEMORIAL DAY. GOD, I'M HAVING A HARD TIME GETTIN' MY BREATH. I HEAR WHA MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID: "BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR, YOU MIGHT GET IT." I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, SO WHAT? I MEAN, IT'S STILL A SECRET, RIGHT? WE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT? We've waited this long. What difference does another day or two make? YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, I GUESS, THEY PROBABLY WAN TO TELL DAVE FIRST, YOU KNOW. YOU'RE SUCH A NICE GUY, JAY LENO. WORRYIN' ABOU YOUR OLD FRIEND, DAVE? YOU WANNA KNOW THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND LETTERMAN? YOU HAD ME. ENOUGH. NOW GO DO YOUR SHOW IN TAHOE, HAVE A GOOD TIME. ( sighing ) Yes, Sparky! ( laughing ) ( growling ) Oh, yes, good boy. All right, we're gonna be right back with a commercial. Paul, get us out. ( audience applauding ) HEY, PETER, HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU? IS JOHNNY HERE? YES, HE'S HERE AND HE'S READY. YOU'RE NOT GONNA TO BELIEVE THIS. WHAT? JOHNNY ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMEN AT THE AFFILIATES MEETING IN CARNEGIE HALL. WH-WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE ANNOUNCES? WHEN? WHEN'S HE GONNA RETIRE? A YEAR FROM NOW. ONE MORE YEAR ON THE AIR HE SAID. HOLY SHIT. AND DID N.B.C. MAKE A... NO. NO. NO ANNOUNCEMEN FROM N.B.C. OK, 20 SECONDS. CAN YOU FUCKING BELIEVE THIS? ISN'T THIS AMAZING? ( coordinator ) 5, 4, 3, 2... Ed couldn't make it, I happened to be in the neighborhood, So I... I brought you a little something. Did you at that? What's that? You're the winner of the million dollar sweepstakes. ( snickering ) MORTY, JOHNNY ASKED ME TO STAY ON UNTIL THE SHOW'S DONE, AND I TOLD HIM I WOULD. AFTER THAT, I'M ALL YOURS. THAT'S GREAT, BECAUSE WE BOTH WANT YOU. No, I, uh, I just happened to be in town doing something for the affiliates. ( David ) That's right. YOU QUIT, JOHNNY, YOU QUIT... YOU QUIT YOUR JOB. THAT'S THE BUSINESS YOU CAME TO... JESUS CHRIST, THIS GUY IS SO GOOD. I CANNOT FUCKING BELIEVE WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM AGOGLIA, WRIGHT, OR LITTLEFIELD. NONE OF THEM. MAYBE THEY LOST THE NUMBER. SO, WE CAN HANDLE UNPLEASANT DAVE? OH, IT'S REAL SIMPLE. FIRST WE SLAP HIM AND THEN WE KISS UP. YEAH, WELL, THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH KISSIN' UP I'M CAPABLE OF. I GOT A SIGNED CONTRAC WITH THIS GUY'S NAME ON IT. FUCK HIM AND HIS BRUISED EGO. MY ASS IS BRUISED FROM SITTIN' ON A GODDAMN PLANE. SO YOU WANT MORTY TO SIT BEHIND THE DESK? ALL RIGHT, FINE, I CAN DO THAT. OK. IS THIS GONNA WORK, PETER? HELLO. HELLO, GENTLEMEN. DAVE WILL BE WITH YOU IN JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES. GREAT, THANKS. CAN I GET YOU SOME COFFEE? PLEASE, BLACK.

THANKS FOR COMIN'. WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT OVER HERE? DAVE, YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE. THE NETWORK HAS BEEN ANALYZING THE LATE NIGHT SITUATION. FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE WATCHED JAY GROW INTO THE ROLE OF HOST. OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE PROUD OF WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED, BUT A CHOICE HAD TO BE MADE. AND SO, TOMORROW N.B.C. WILL ANNOUNCE THAT JAY LENO HAS BEEN NAMED THE NEXT HOST OF THE TONIGHT SHOW. UH, AND I'M SURE THA JAY WILL DO A FINE JOB. UH, BUT I MUST TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE DONE THIS SHOW FOR 10 YEARS. AND, UH, WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS SHOW. NOW, THE BEST THING WOULD'VE BEEN FOR ALL OF US HERE TO HAVE GONE ON AND DONE THE TONIGHT SHOW. THAT'S WHAT WE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO. AND IT'S A REAL DISAPPOINTMEN THAT WE'RE NOT. BUT IF IT IS YOUR FINAL DECISION, UH, THEN YOU CAN CONTACT MY LAWYER. GENTLEMEN, THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

NO, NO, NO, I SUCKED. NO, YOU DIDN'T SUCK. THERE'S SOMETHING THERE. I'VE KNOWN THOSE GUYS. WARREN LITTLEFIELD HAS NEVER SEEN ME LIKE THAT. DAVID. DAVID. THEY THOUGHT I WAS GEORGE PEPPARD. IT DIDN'T WORK. WE DON'T KNOW THAT... WE DO KNOW, THEY JUST TOLD ME IN THEIR OWN CHARMING, FUCKING INIMITABLE WAY. THEY'RE GOING WITH JAY. AS FAR AS N.B.C.'S CONCERNED, YOU'RE 12:30. AND THAT'S IT? YEAH. THAT'S IT. FUCK. ( Peter ) DAVID, I KNOW YOU'RE DEPRESSED, BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING. FIGHTING FOR WHAT? I'M FUCKED. I'M FINISHED, MY TIME IS UP. IT'S THE END OF THE ROAD FOR, UH, T.V. BOY. DAVID, DON'T GET INTO THAT. DO YOU WAN THE TONIGHT SHOW? UH, WHY DON'T YOU ASK IF I WANT TO PLAY CENTER FIELD FOR THE YANKEES? OF COURSE I WAN THE TONIGHT SHOW. IT'S MY... ( sighing ) SINCE I WAS 10 YEARS OLD, IT'S THE ONLY DREAM IN MY WHOLE LIFE. ALL RIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT? YOU CAN'T JUST WANT IT, YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. I HAVE DONE A TELEVISION PROGRAM ON THEIR NETWORK FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT? I PUT A... A PENALTY CLAUSE IN MY CONTRAC IF THEY DON'T GIVE ME THE TONIGHT SHOW. HOW MUCH? A MILLION DOLLARS. DAVID, THAT'S TIP MONEY TO THOSE GUYS. ALL RIGHT, I'M A PINHEAD, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING. COME ON. NOW WHAT DO I DO? I JUST WANT THAT SHOW. I MEAN, I'M ONLY REALLY HAPPY THAT ONE HOUR A DAY WHEN I'M DOING MY SHOW. DAVID, YOU WILL HAVE A SHOW. YOU'RE A TELEVISION STAR. PEOPLE WILL WANNA HIRE YOU. YEAH, WHO? C.B.S.? C.B.S. JUST FIRED PAT SAJAK. PAT SAJAK. THEIR GUMS ARE STILL BLEEDING. THEY DON'T WANNA HEAR THE WORDS LATE NIGHT EVER AGAIN. A.B.C.? A.B.C.'S GOT TED KOPPEL ON AT 11:30. HE'S THE GOLD STANDARD. I'M NICKEL-PLATING. SO WHAT DOES THAT LEAVE, SYNDICATION? HO! HO! WHAT A FEELING, CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING SOLD BY A SYNDICATOR? "WE GOT, LETTERMAN, OR STUDS. YOU CAN EITHER HAVE STUDS OR LETTERMAN." I'M FUCKED, PETE. LISTEN, DAVID. DON'T ACCEP WHAT N.B.C. IS DOING TO YOU. YOU SIMPLY CAN'T. YOU MUST NO FOLLOW JAY LENO, BECAUSE YOU'LL HATE YOURSELF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. IT WILL MAKE YOU CRAZY. BUT I'VE ALREADY LOST THE JOB TO HIM. WHAT ELSE AM I GONNA DO? HOW ABOUT GETTING AN AGENT? NOW DON'T REJEC THE IDEA OUT OF HAND, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT AGENTS. BUT WE NEED SOMEBODY WITH SOME POWER IN THE BUSINESS. YEAH, I KNOW, BUT, JESUS, AN AGENT? AN AGENT'S WHAT YOU PULL OFF THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SHOE AFTER A BASEBALL GAME. THEY'RE JUST GONNA BOOK ME IN TAHOE WITH TONY ORLANDO AND DAWN. LISTEN, DAVID, I HAVE AN IDEA. DAVID. PETER. MIKE OVITZ. PLEASE COME IN, IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE. PLEASE. THANK YOU. DAVID, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THIS, BUT YEARS AGO, WHEN YOU WERE WITH WILLIAM MORRIS, AND I WAS STILL AN AGENT THERE, WE ACTUALLY ME VERY BRIEFLY. UH, JEEZ, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REMEMBER THAT. WHAT I REMEMBER IS, YOU WERE THE FUNNIEST GUY IN THE ROOM. IN FACT, I... I DON'T THINK WE GOT MUCH ACCOMPLISHED THAT DAY. MICHAEL, MAYBE WE SHOULD TELL YOU A LITTLE BI ABOUT DAVID'S CIRCUMSTANCES. PETER, I KNOW DAVE'S CIRCUMSTANCES. AND SO I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE. DAVE IS A STAR OF SUCH COMPELLING STATURE THAT FRANKLY, IT MAKES ME PERSONALLY ANGRY HE FINDS HIMSELF THIS ABUSED. WE PRIDE OURSELVES HERE AT C.A.A., IN DEVELOPING A CAREER PLAN FOR OUR CLIENTS THAT PROTECTS THEM AS MUCH AS IT ENRICHES THEM. DAVID HAS SE SUCH AN INCREDIBLY HIGH PROFESSIONAL STANDARD, AND YET HE IS GOING DISTURBINGLY UNREWARDED. THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. IT'S SIMPLY BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE. OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE AN INTENSE INTERES IN ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, DAVE, AND WITH YOU, PETER. FRANKLY, WE HAVE WORKED OU A CAREER PLAN FOR DAVID AND IT INCLUDES SECURING EVERYTHING FOR DAVE THAT HE WANTS. EVERYTHING. OF COURSE, THAT MEANS AN 11:30 TELEVISION SHOW. DAVE WILL BE OFFERED AN 11:30 SHOW AND HE WILL BE OFFERED I BY EVERY NETWORK. THE GEOMETRY OF THE DEAL WILL BE FAR LARGER. THE STUDIOS WILL BE IN, THE SYNDICATORS, THE FULL RANGE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. WE SHALL FRAME A DEAL THAT WILL MAKE YOU ONE OF THE GIANTS. AND IF YOU GIVE US THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH YOU, C.A.A. WILL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING YOUR TALENTS DESERVE AND YOUR SPIRIT DESIRES. ( bell tolling ) WATER? HUH? ( laughing ) OH, MY GOD! ( laughing ) JESUS, THAT WAS LIKE HAVING, AS IF IT WAS LIKE HAVING A MEETING WITH THE... THE... WITH THE GODFATHER. THE... THE GODFATHER. ( both laughing ) ( car phone ringing ) HELLO? ( Helen ) Hi, Warren, good morning. THERESA TOLD ME I'D FIND YOU IN THE CAR. GOOD MORNING, HELEN, HOW ARE THINGS? WELL, I'VE HAD IT WITH THE CARSON PEOPLE, TRYING TO GE ANYTHING OUT OF THEM. THEY WOULDN'T PU JAY ON THE SHOW, THEY WOULDN'T PASS THE BATON. PASS THE WHAT, HELEN? PASS THE BATON. I HAD THIS GREAT IDEA. I THOUGHT JOHNNY SHOULD SAY GOODBYE FRIDAY, LEAVE HIS DESK, TAKE HIS HAND-HELD MIKE, walk over to our studio, HAND IT OVER TO JAY RIGHT ON THE AIR, PASS THE BATON. AND YOU SUGGESTED THIS TO WHOM? PETER LASSALLY. IT WAS LIKE I PEED ON HIS SHOE. WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY MIGHT WANNA FINISH ON THEIR OWN TERMS, HELEN. YOU... YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME FOR YOUR IDEAS. ( Helen ) We sure will starting Monday. NOW, I WANNA TALK ABOU THE AD AGAIN. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS, HELEN, AND... AND WE CAN'T BUY AN AD FOR JAY IN FRIDAY'S PAPER BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY BOUGH A FULL PAGE AD THERE TO SAY GOODBYE TO JOHNNY. WHY CAN'T N.B.C. BUY A FULL PAGE AD TO WELCOME JAY TO FACE JOHNNY'S AD? BECAUSE, AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE, THE PAPER'S DOING IT'S OWN FULL PAGE OF STORIES, SALUTING JOHNNY ON THE PAGE OPPOSITE THE AD, AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO CROWD THA WITH A "WELCOME JAY" AD. THAT'S IT, END OF STORY, HELEN. NO, IT'S NOT THE END OF STORY. I'M TELLING YOU, THAT AD'S GOING IN ON FRIDAY. IF N.B.C. WON'T BUY THE FUCKING THING, I'LL PAY FOR IT MYSELF, BUT THAT AD IS GOING IN. NO, IT ISN'T, AND IT'S NO GOING TO BE YOUR MONEY AND YOU'RE NOT DOING I BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW IT. WE-WE-WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, WE'VE LISTENED, AND WE'VE MADE A DECISION, AND THAT DECISION IS FINAL. I KNEW I COULD EXPECT SHIT LIKE THIS FROM A DICKLESS WONDER LIKE YOU. WELL, FUCK YOU, HELEN. FUCK YOU AND THE HORSE YOU RODE IN ON. YOU'RE WRONG, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS, I WILL NOT ALLOW IT. YOU CLOSED JAY'S CONTRACT, DIDN'T YOU? YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND. BUT I GO THE FUCKING SHOW, ANYWAY. I CAN SEE THAT THIS MAN IS EMBRACED BY THIS NETWORK... IT'S YOUR ONLY NATURAL TALENT, WARREN, FUCKING UP. ENOUGH, IT'S OVER, DONE. ( phone buzzing ) ( laughing ) ( people laughing ) ( crickets chirping ) ( Johnny ) So, this is it. I am one of the lucky people in the world because I got to do something I've always wanted to do, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. And I can only tell you, it's been an honor to come into your homes and let me entertain you. And I hope when I do find something that I want to do, you will still invite me into your home as you always have. I bid you a very heartfelt goodbye. ( audience applauding ) ( cheering ) ( whistling ) ( Jay ) IS THIS WHERE YOU WANT ME TO STAND? I MEAN, I ALWAYS STAND RIGHT HERE. WHERE THE FUCK IS BILLY CRYSTAL? AND WHY HASN' HE ARRIVED YET? STAND UP STRAIGHT, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. YOU'RE THE HOST OF THE TONIGHT SHOW. SO, JAY, UH, HOW'S IT GOING? OH, YOU KNOW ME. YEAH, MR. STRESS. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE READY TO TAKE A NAP. MAYBE I WILL. I WANNA... WANNA GET IT OVER WITH. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE SHOULD LOSE THE SECOND PEROT JOKE. LISTEN, JAY, DON'T YOU THINK IT'D BE APPROPRIATE TO, UH, SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT JOHNNY EARLY IN THE SHOW, YOU KNOW? THAT WASN'T MY DECISION. YEAH, BUT STILL, I MEAN... BOB WRIGHT? HIM I GUESS I HAVE TO TALK TO. ( woman ) Go ahead. HI, BOB. SO NICE OF YOU TO CHECK IN TODAY. THANKS, HELEN. I JUST CALLED TO WISH JAY WELL TONIGHT. I'M SURE HE'S GONNA HAVE A GREAT SHOW. OH, THANKS. I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. I'M SURE YOU ARE. LISTEN. HELEN, I DID HAVE ONE OTHER THOUGHT. WHAT'S JAY GONNA DO TO THANK JOHNNY? WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING. I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHY. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY? OK, UH, THE NEW SHOW IS GONNA BE ENTIRELY DIFFEREN FROM THE OLD SHOW. WE DON'T WANNA LIKE BEHOLDEN TO JOHNNY'S OLD AUDIENCE. GET THAT OUT HERE. EVERY COMIC KNOWS YOU SALUTE THE LAST GUY TO GET MORE APPLAUSE FOR YOURSELF. I MEAN, THAT'S KISS UP STUFF, JAY DOESN'T DO KISS UP. I THINK IT'S A TERRIBLE MISTAKE, HELEN. I... I... IT BOILS DOWN TO SIMPLE POLITENESS. I WOULD REALLY LIKE FOR YOU TO GO DOWN THERE AND TELL JAY TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE, "I WOULDN'T BE HERE BUT FOR JOHNNY." NO, I'M NOT GONNA GO TO JAY ONE HOUR BEFORE A LIVE BROADCAS AND TELL HIM TO INSERT SOME TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY CARSON. ABSOLUTELY NOT. BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR GOOD WISHES, AND I'LL TELL JAY YOU CALLED. ( phone buzzing ) ( male announcer ) From the N.B.C. Studios in Burbank, The Tonight Show, with Jay Leno. Featuring Branford Marsalis, and The Tonight Show band. Tonight, Jay welcomes comedian, Billy Crystal. And musical guest, Garth Brooks. And now, Jay Leno. ( all applauding ) YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS. I GOT OFFICIAL NOTICE FROM C.A.A. "ALL FUTURE BUSINESS ACTIVITY FOR DAVID LETTERMAN WILL BE HANDLED THROUGH MICHAEL OVITZ'S OFFICE." HE HIRED OVITZ? WHAT, IS HE TRYING TO GET SPRUNG? HE'D HAVE TO HIRE GOD FOR THAT. WELL, LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS. DAVE DIDN'T HIRE MIKE OVITZ TO GET A 5-YEAR DEAL OUT OF US TO STAY AT 12:30, THAT'S NOT A BIG ENOUGH MOVE FOR HIM. NOW THIS ONLY WORKS IF HE GETS 11:30 FOR DAVE. YOU'RE NOT LISTENING, WARREN. DAVE CAN BRING MACHIAVELLI BACK FROM THE DEAD, IT STILL DOES NO DO HIM ANY GOOD. I MADE THIS DEAL. WE'VE GOT FULL PROTECTION. WHAT IS HE GONNA DO? OVITZ, HUH? PUT HIM ON TELEVISION IN VENEZUELA? COME ON. THAT'S FUNNY. ( Lee ) THIS LETTERMAN CONTRACT HAS CLAUSES IN I A PRISONER WOULDN'T HAVE. HOW THE HELL DO WE GET HIM OUT OF IT? GIVE ME ALL THE BAD NEWS. WHATEVER DEAL WE MAKE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO MATCH, AND THEY CAN TAKE A FULL YEAR TO MATCH WHICH MEANS THEY COULD KEEP HIM OFF THE AIR IF THEY WANT. THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D HAVE IN A DEAL FOR A SPORTS ANNOUNCER ON SOME LOCAL RADIO STATION. GETS WORSE. N.B.C. HAS FIRST NEGOTIATING POSITION. WE CAN'T EVEN TALK A DEAL WITH ANYONE BUT THEM FOR 18 MONTHS. NO OFFERS, NOTHING. OK, SO WE DON'T NEGOTIATE. WE CAN STILL TALK TO PEOPLE, RIGHT? SURE WE CAN TALK, WHAT THEN? THEN WE SET UP PITCHES. WE CAN'T PITCH LETTERMAN AROUND, MIKE, N.B.C. WOULD CHALLENGE IT. NO, NO, NO, WE DON'T PITCH LETTERMAN TO ANYBODY. THEY PITCH THEMSELVES TO US. WE REVERSE THE PROCESS. ( Lee ) AND IT'S LEGAL, TOO? YES. WE CAN'T STOP SOMEBODY FROM TALKING TO US. PARDON ME. ( people chattering ) ROD. HOWARD. OH, I BEG YOUR PARDON. YES, I MADE THE PLANE IN 14 SECONDS. I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT. WE NEED YOU. ALL THE HEAVYWEIGHTS ARE COMING. I HEARD EISNER'S GOING TO PITCH DISNEY HIMSELF. REALLY? I WISH THEY'D MADE I CLEARER EARLIER THAT THIS WAS A TRUE PITCH. MORTON CALLED ME YESTERDAY AND TOLD ME THEY'D SEE ME HERE. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I KNEW I HAD TO COME. ALL I HAD WAS THIS OLD SUIT. THEN I GET ON THE PLANE AND REALIZE I HAD NO BLOODY CUFF LINKS. PAPER CLIPS. I'M JUST AFRAID LETTERMAN WILL SEE THEM AND CONCLUDE LARRY TISCH IS A BIGGER TIGHTWAD THAN G.E., WHICH ISN'T FAR WRONG. ( men chattering ) HI, RON. UH, GENTLEMEN, I'M SORRY, WE ARE UNDER A BIT OF A TIME CONSTRAINT, SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH HOW YOU DO BUSINESS AND TO SEE HOW DAVE MIGHT FIT IN WITH YOUR PLANS. I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THAT THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIATION. IT IS, FOR WANT OF A BETTER WORD, A PROCESS. SO, HOWARD, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK FIRST FOR C.B.S.? DAVID, I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE, UH, AN APPRECIATION FOR THE HISTORY AND TRADITION OF BROADCASTING. MUCH OF THAT TRADITION HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY C.B.S. EVEN IN ENGLAND WE KNEW JACK BENNY, AND LUCY, AND GLEASON. NOW, DOES DAVID LETTERMAN FIT THAT TRADITION? ( clapping ) LIKE A GLOVE. THE POINT IS, THE C.B.S. OF PRESEN CAN GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT, DAVID. AFFILIATE STRENGTH, STRONG MANAGEMENT, EXCELLENT PROMOTION, AND, YES, WE HAVE SPACE AVAILABLE AT 11:30 EVERY WEEKNIGHT. AND WE'RE A NETWORK. WE'RE WHAT YOU WANT, DAVE. WE'RE A HOME. MICHAEL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. YOU HAVE A YOUNG AUDIENCE, WE'RE THE YOUNG NETWORK. WE'RE ALSO THE ONLY ONES CAPABLE OF OFFERING YOU A START TIME OF 11:00 P.M. THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE JUMP ON MR. LENO. HI, ROBERT, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. A.B.C. HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE NETWORK FOR THE YOUNG VIEWERS. WE KNOW HOW TO REACH THAT AUDIENCE AND DELIVER IT TO YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY HERE TODAY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT NIGHTLINE, BUT... HI, ALAN, THANK YOU FOR COMING, I APPRECIATE IT. WE'LL BUILD THE ENTIRE SYNDICATION OPERATION AT COLUMBIA AROUND DAVID LETTERMAN AND LATE NIGHT. WE EXPECT WE COULD LAUNCH NATIONALLY WITH A LINEUP OF STATIONS AS STRONG AS ANY NETWORK'S. ( David ) UH, WELL, THAT SOUNDS GREAT, BOB. UH, ALAN... WHATEVER. ( laughing ) HI, BRANDON. HOW ARE YOU? I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. MORTY. AT PARAMOUNT, WE'VE PROVED WITH ARSENIO, WE ALREADY KNOW HOW TO MAKE LATE-NIGHT WORK IN SYNDICATION. I THINK IT'S A PERFECT MATCH. ARSENIO FOLLOWED BY LETTERMAN. I'd follow the example of their nominee: don't inhale. ( sighing ) LISTEN TO THIS OLD FOOL. ON AND ON. AND ON. AND ON. ( people applauding ) IT'S GETTING CLOSE TO 11:00. THE LOCAL NEWS WILL START LATE. GET WARREN ON THE PHONE. WE RESCHEDULE OUR FUCKING LIVES TO DO A LIVE SHOW SO JAY CAN FOLLOW UP THEIR GHASTLY CONVENTION COVERAGE WITH SOME NEW JOKES. THEN THEY WON'T LE US ON THE GODDAMN AIR. MOTHERFUCKERS IN NEWS FUCKING US AGAIN. WARREN, THEY'RE LETTING THIS GO ON. HE'S NOT GOING TO FINISH BY 11:00. I SWEAR TO YOU, I'M SENDING MY AUDIENCE HOME, IF YOU DON'T GE THIS OVER ON TIME. NO, I'M NOT LOSIN' IT. YOU SAID YOU HAD THIS UNDER CONTROL. ( people cheering ) LOOK, A PAUSE, RIGHT THERE. THEY COULD'VE CUT HIM OFF. GET ME GARTNER IN HOUSTON. GOD DAMN IT! IT'S 11:00 P.M. IN THE EAST RIGHT NOW. ( man ) MR. GARTNER, PHONE FOR YOU. HELEN KUSHNICK ON THE LINE. YEAH, GARTNER HERE. YOU PROMISED ME YOU'D BE OFF BY 11:00, YOU SHITHEAD. I'M GOING LIVE TONIGH SO WE CAN GET SOME PAY-OFF FROM YOUR HORSE SHI CONVENTION COVERAGE. I'M ACCOMMODATING YOU BY GIVING BROKAW AIRTIME WITH JAY. YOU GET THIS GASBAG REAGAN OFF THE AIR NOW, OR I'M NOT USING BROKAW TONIGHT. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT IF YOU USE BROKAW TONIGH OR ANY OTHER NIGHT, LADY. AND LET'S GE SOMETHING STRAIGHT. I AM THE PRESIDEN OF N.B.C. NEWS. YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT I DO. I'M TAKING YOU OFF THE AIR THIS TIME, YOU POMPOUS ASS. THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON WHO CAN TAKE ME OFF THE AIR. BOB WRIGHT. I'LL GIVE YOU HIS NUMBER, CALL HIM. I DON'T NEED TO CALL BOB FUCKING WRIGHT. I'LL SEND MY AUDIENCE HOME AND THEN YOU CAN CALL HIM AND EXPLAIN WHY THE TONIGHT SHOW WASN'T ON THE FUCKING AIR. BECAUSE THE NEWS ASSHOLE COULDN'T GET A HORSESHI SPEECH OFF ON TIME! SEND THEM HOME. GET THEM THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. HELEN, IS THIS A GOOD IDEA? CA-CAN YOU DO THIS? HEY, WHO THE FUCK MADE YOU THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER? YOU DO THE FUCKING JOKES. I RUN THE FUCKING SHOW. I'VE MADE THE DECISION. THEY FUCKED US, SO NOW THEY DON'T GET A SHOW. GET THESE FUCKING PEOPLE OUT OF HERE NOW. THERE IS NO SHOW FOR THEM TO SEE! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE, WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL, TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES RIGHT NOW. HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING THE CONVENTION COVERAGE? I COULD'VE BEEN A DOCTOR. WELL, IT'S NOT TOO LATE. WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE LATE. BUT I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. THE SHOW SHOULD START, I THINK, AROUND 11:00... THAT'S GREAT, WARREN, BUT I WANTED TO... WOULD YOU HOLD THAT THOUGHT? I WAS JUST ABOUT TO CALL. WHAT... WHAT... WHAT... WHAT THE HELL? THAT SHIP HAS SAILED. THERE'S... THERE'S NOBODY HERE. JESUS CHRIST. WHAT, SHE SEN THE AUDIENCE HOME? WE DON'T HAVE A TONIGHT SHOW? YOU KNOW, I'VE ALREADY SOLD THIS THING TO ADVERTISERS. CHRIST! SHE KILLED A SCHEDULED SHOW! OUR LEVEL OF TOLERANCE WITH HELEN KUSHNICK IS COMPLETELY USED UP. SO IS OURS. THAT WOMAN CANCELED THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH NO AUTHORIZATION WHATSOEVER. WE HAD LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR TO GET THAT REPEA OR WE WOULD HAVE GONE DARK. SHE IS COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL. THAT'S BECOME APPAREN TO EVERYBODY NOW, BOB. THE PROBLEM IS, WHAT WE DO ABOUT IT? IF WE MAKE A MOVE ON HELEN NOW, JAY COULD BE INJURED. MAYBE IRREPARABLY. THE GUY SEEMS TO BE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON HER. THAT'S HIS PROBLEM, NOT OURS. IT'S OURS IF JAY WALKS OFF THE SHOW. AND THE RATINGS HAVE BEEN SOLID. I HATE TO TAMPER WITH THE SHOW. MAYBE... MAYBE WE SHOULD JUS LIMP ALONG FOR A WHILE. YEAH, AND WAIT FOR HER TO SELF-DESTRUCT. SHE WILL, SOON, THE WAY SHE'S GOING. THEN IT WON'T BE AN ISSUE WITH JAY. AND WE WON' HAVE TO PAY HER OFF. I THINK IT'S MORE APPAREN THAN EVER BEFORE THAT WE SHOULD KEEP OUR OPTIONS OPEN WITH LETTERMAN. IF YOU TWO WANT TO LIMP ALONG WITH THIS SITUATION FOR NOW, THAT'S YOUR CALL. BUT AT SOME POINT, AND IT'S GETTING TO BE SOON, IT'S GOING TO BE MY CALL. ( door closing ) I'd just like to say thank you to all of you for this wonderful tribute. It has been one of the most memorable nights of my life. Thank you. Thank you, Rupert. Thank you, everyone. Your generosity has been greatly... EXCUSE ME. GOOD NIGHT. ( people chattering ) MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR US TO TALK, BOB. YOU HEARD ABOUT KUSHNICK? WELL, I WON'T GET IN THE MIDDLE OF WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO ABOUT KUSHNICK BUT, UH, IF YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING WITH DAVE, I HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS. I'D LIKE TO HEAR THEM. WELL, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT... HI, HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. NICE TO SEE YOU. HI. I THINK IT'S IMPORTAN FOR N.B.C., IF YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT KEEPING DAVE, TO START CREATING SOME GOODWILL. THERE'S ENOUGH ANIMOSITY IN THIS RELATIONSHIP TO START A SMALL WAR. TO MY MIND, IT'S ALL BEEN STUPID AND UNWARRANTED. THANK YOU. I'M ALL FOR GOODWILL. WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? BOB, WE'RE PREVENTED FROM PURSUING OFFERS FOR DAVID. BECAUSE WE'RE REQUIRED BY N.B.C. TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEM FIRST. BUT THAT CLAUSE ONLY SERVES TO ENSURE THAT DAVID WILL NOT LISTEN TO ANY INITIAL OFFERS YOU MIGHT MAKE, GENEROUS AS THEY MAY BE BECAUSE NATURALLY HE'S GOING TO WANT TO TEST THE WATERS ELSEWHERE. SO WE CAN ALL PLAY THIS GAME OR WE COULD JUS LOOSEN UP THE CHAINS A LITTLE BIT. HOW? YOU CAN ALLOW US TO SOLICI OTHER OFFERS OPENLY. AFTER ALL, YOU STILL RETAIN THE MATCHING RIGHTS. SEEMS LIKE WE'RE CONCEDING AN AWFUL LOT FOR THE SAKE OF GOODWILL. MAYBE, MAYBE YOU COULD OFFER SOMETHING IN RETURN. OUR SALES DEPARTMENT TELLS ME THAT WE'VE SOLD THE LETTERMAN SHOW TILL THE END OF JUNE. BUT, AS YOU KNOW, DAVID'S CONTRACT IS UP APRIL 2. SO, IF WE DON'T RE-SIGN HIM, WE'LL HAVE TO RETURN THAT MONEY. UNLESS... ( both chuckling ) UNLESS WE GIVE YOU A 3-MONTH EXTENSION. OK, ALL RIGHT. SO THAT'S THE DEAL. WE GIVE YOU 3 MONTHS, AND YOU FREE US UP TO NEGOTIATE. DO YOU, DO YOU THINK DAVID WOULD SEE THAT AS A GESTURE OF GOODWILL? I BELIEVE I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT HE WOULD. ( laughing ) GOOD. HELLO, HOWARD. MIKE. LISTEN, WE'RE READY TO TALK SERIOUSLY NOW. ( woman ) Robert Morton on 3. MORTY, HOW ARE THINGS IN NEW YORK? ( Morty ) New York is great. It's great to talk to you, too. I'M SURE YOU'RE QUITE BUSY WITH THE SHOW. YEAH, I'M DAMN BUSY. SO WHAT'S UP? UH, YOU'VE PROBABLY BEEN TOO BUSY TO REALIZE YOU'VE DOUBLE-BOOKED ONE OF OUR GUESTS. APPARENTLY, YOU'VE GO ROGER DALTREY IN THE SAME WEEK WE'VE GOT HIM. Now I'm sure this is just an oversight by your staff, BUT I THOUGH I'LL JUST LET YOU, UH, KNOW THE WAY WE WORK THINGS. WE ALWAYS HAD THIS "GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT" WITH JOHNNY... MORTY, HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED I'M NO GENTLEMAN? WELL, HELEN, IT'S JUST THA THE RECORD COMPANY IS TELLING US YOU'RE TRYING TO FORCE DALTREY INTO CANCELING HIS APPEARANCE WITH US. I MEAN, HE'S OUR GUEST, HELEN. HE IS? WELL, LET ME HELP YOU OUT HERE, MORTY. YOU HAVE NO POWER WITH N.B.C. TO BACK YOU UP ON GUESTS. YOU REALLY THINK N.B.C.'S GONNA BACK YOUR SHOW OVER MINE? Your guy was the loser, remember? THAT'S A CHEAP SHOT, HELEN. ( chuckling ) YOU CAN EXPECT MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. YOU HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE NETWORK. YOU'RE HELPLESS. YOU REALLY OUGHT TO HAVE ME DO YOUR NEXT CONTRACT FOR YOU. YOU'RE MAKING BUPKIS NEXT TO ME. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS. I REALLY DID. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I WILL FIGHT YOU ON DALTREY AND EVERY GUEST YOU TRY TO STEAL. OOH, GOOD LUCK, MIGHTY MOUSE. ( sighing ) ( woman ) It's Kushnick on one. HELEN. KENNY, I'LL GET RIGH TO THE POINT. WE SEE TRAVIS' BILLBOARDS ALL OVER TOWN, WE WANT TO BOOK HIM. GEE, THAT'S GREAT, HELEN. THAT'S REALLY NICE. WHEN DO YOU WANT TO... WE WANT HIM THIS WEEK, WHEN HE'S HERE FOR THE CONCERT. ( Ken ) Oh, gee, I'm sorry. HE'S ON ARSENIO ON WEDNESDAY. YEAH, I KNOW. MY BOOKERS TOLD ME. SO, CANCEL IT. ARSENIO'S OVER WITH, HE'S IN THE TOILET. HIS ADVERTISERS ARE DESERTING HIM. BY THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WON'T EVEN BE AN ARSENIO. HE'S ON THE AIR NOW, AND WE'RE COMMITTED THERE. I GUESS YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME. LET ME SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU. IF YOU WANT TRAVIS ON THIS SHOW EVER AGAIN, YOU BETTER BREAK THAT DATE WITH ARSENIO. HELEN, I THINK YOU NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT ME. I MEAN, I DON'T RESPOND WELL TO THREATS. Look, maybe I can offer you something else. We got a movie of the week coming up we need to promote WITH KENNY ROGERS, TRAVIS, AND NAOMI JUDD. WHAT IF I COULD GET THEM ALL ON THE SAME SHOW... EXCUSE ME, THIS AIN'T MERV GRIFFIN. WE DON'T DO FUCKING THEME SHOWS, YOU DUMB SHIT-KICKING HICK. LET ME BREAK THE NEWS TO YOU. NOT ONLY IS TRAVIS TRIT NOT GOING TO DO THE TONIGHT SHOW EVER AGAIN, BUT YOU AND I WILL BE IN THIS TOWN A LONG TIME. WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER, AND WE'LL NEVER TALK AGAIN. IT'S YOUR FUCKING LOSS AND THE RECORD COMPANY'S. ( birds chirping ) KEN, THE BOOKING OFFICE FROM LENO JUST CALLED. TRISHA YEARWOOD'S APPEARANCE HAS BEEN CANCELED. TRISHA YEARWOOD HAS BEEN BOOKED ON LENO FOR MONTHS. I MEAN, HOW CAN HELEN GET AWAY WITH THIS CRAP? WELL, I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT! GET ME ROBERT HILBURN AT THE L.A. TIMES. BRACE YOURSELF, WARREN. KEN KRAGEN HAS GONE PUBLIC ABOUT HELEN. HOLY HELL IS BREAKING LOOSE. ( Warren ) THIS IS IT. EVEN JAY CAN SEE SHE'S TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. ( chuckling ) INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION. OOH, OOH. ( John ) HELEN HAS ONE OPTION. SHE ACCEPTS THIS REDEFINITION OF DUTIES OR SHE'S OFF THE SHOW. ( Helen ) "CAN'T BOOK GUESTS." I DON'T DO THAT ALREADY, WE HAVE BOOKERS FOR THAT. "CAN'T CANCEL GUESTS." I'VE NEVER CANCELED A GUEST. NO MATTER WHA THE FUCKING L.A. TIMES SAYS. "CANNOT TALK TO THE MEDIA." WELL, THAT'S A RELIEF. WHO NEEDS THAT? THIS IS NO REDEFINITION OF MY DUTIES. IT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING ALL ALONG. AND IF YOU SIGN THIS, WE'LL HOLD YOUR FEET TO THE FLAME ON EVERY ISSUE. WHEN... WHEN THEY PU JOHN SUNUNU OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, EVERYTHING FELL APART. YOU GUYS JUST WANT ME TO PROVE I CAN BE A GOOD LITTLE GIRL? WOULD ANY OF THIS BE PULLED WITH A MALE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER? BULLSHIT! WELL, OK, I CAN BE A GOOD LITTLE GIRL. WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO? TRY TO CONTROL YOURSELF. STOP FUCKING WITH ME, WARREN. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO. YOU'VE MADE A MESS OF PRIME TIME. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T MEASURE UP TO THE JOB BRANDON DID. SO THIS IS ALL YOU CAN DO TO TRY TO SAVE YOUR OWN ASS IS TO COME AFTER ME. DID YOU KNOW THEY'RE TALKING TO DON OHLMEYER FOR YOUR JOB? AND KERRY McCLUGGAGE? SO GO FUCK YOURSELF, WARREN. I MEAN, YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF PRACTICE AT THAT, RIGHT? HELEN. ( door closing ) SHE'LL NEVER MAKE I AS A DIPLOMAT. IF YOU LOVE HER, GET HER OUT OF HERE. SHE NEEDS HELP. WE ALL NEED HELP. THE NUMBERS ARE STILL GOOD, ISN'T THAT WHAT'S IMPORTANT? IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU'RE APPROACHING DISASTER. HELEN HAS PUSHED TOO FAR. THE WHOLE TOWN IS RISING UP AGAINST HER. IT'S NOT AS EASY AS YOU THINK. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, HELEN MADE ALL THIS HAPPEN FOR ME. EVERYTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING BEFORE I MET HELEN? I WAS WORKING A STRIP CLUBS, YOU KNOW. I WASN'T GOING TO BE ON ANY TELEVISION SHOW. AN AGENT TOLD ME I HAD A FACE THAT WOULD SCARE SMALL CHILDREN. LOOK AT ME, I'M THE... I'M THE HOST OF THE TONIGHT SHOW. HELEN KUSHNICK GOT IT FOR ME. AND SHE COULD LOSE IT FOR YOU, TOO. GREAT. ( mumbling ) 17 YEARS IS AN AWFUL LONG... ( sighing ) HER SON DIED OF AIDS, YOU KNOW. THE HOSPITAL GAVE HIM A BAD TRANSFUSION, A 3-YEAR-OLD BABY. THAT WAS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY. HER HUSBAND GETS COLON CANCER, HE DIED A YEAR AFTER THAT. SHE HAD A MASTECTOMY. JERRY KUSHNICK ON HIS DEATHBED ASKED ME TO TAKE CARE OF HER. I RECOGNIZE YOU HAVE INTENSE FEELINGS ABOUT THIS. YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO FEEL LOYALTY TO HELEN. BUT WE'RE PAST THAT. NOW, I WAS A PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR IN COLLEGE, AND WHAT JOHN AND I ARE DOING WITH YOU NOW, WE WOULD HAVE TO CALL AN INTERVENTION. WHAT YOU SEE AS LOYALTY TO A WOMAN WHO HAS SUFFERED DEEPLY, WE SEE AS A FORM OF ADDICTION. NOW SHE CANNOT CONTINUE TO PRODUCE A TELEVISION SHOW IN THIS CONDITION. HELEN IS EITHER GOING TO TAKE YOU DOWN, OR YOU ARE GOING TO SEPARATE FROM HER. BUT SHE IS NO GOING TO TAKE ME DOWN. SHE IS FIRED. IF WE HAVE TO, WE'LL BAR HER FROM THE LOT. ( exclaiming ) ( stuttering ) WHAT IF... WHAT IF I WERE TO WALK OUT WITH HER? IF YOU CAN'T SEPARATE FROM HELEN, IT'S A BIG MISTAKE. I REGRET IT, BUT WE HAVE CHOICES TO MAKE, AND THE CHOICE I HAVE TO MAKE IS TO TELL DAVID LETTERMAN THAT IT'S TIME TO TAKE OVER THE TONIGHT SHOW. I... I SUSPECT THA PETER LASSALLY AND DAVID COULD BE IN BURBANK ON 24 HOURS NOTICE. YOU GUYS WOULD DO THAT TO ME? I WOULD ABSOLUTELY DO THAT, THAT'S HOW STRONGLY WE FEEL. I NEED A COMMITMEN FROM YOU, JAY. WILL YOU BE AT WORK TOMORROW? ( exhaling ) WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THA IF I DON'T COME TO WORK I'M GOING TO BE FIRED? I'M NOT SAYING THAT EXACTLY. BUT IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN? THAT I'M GOING TO BE FIRED IF I DON'T SHOW UP FOR WORK? JAY, ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOME LEGAL JUSTIFICATION FOR BREAKING WITH HELEN? IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION. JUST TELL ME. IF I DON'T COME TO WORK TOMORROW, ARE YOU GOING TO FIRE ME? YES, I GUESS WE'RE... WE'RE SAYING THAT. YOU GUYS CAN LET YOURSELVES OUT. AGOGLIA HANDED ME THIS WHEN I CAME IN. THEY'RE FIRING ME. I TOLD HIM YOU'D NEVER STAND FOR THIS. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT? ISSUE A STATEMEN BACKING ME. THEN WE JUST GO ON WITH THE SHOW. JUST LIKE THAT? AREN'T YOU STILL FIRED? NOT IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT IT. THEY'LL NEVER LET YOU GO. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS THREATEN TO QUIT. THEY'LL CAVE, THEY'VE GOT NO BALLS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY TOLD ME? THEY TOLD ME THEY'D FIRE ME AND BRING IN DAVID. THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME. OH, BULLSHIT. IT'S NOT BULLSHIT. THESE GUYS HATE LETTERMAN. ALL WE GOT TO DO IS STAY STRONG, HONEY. NO. YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING IS ALL OUT OF CONTROL NOW... HEY, HOLD IT. WHAT? DON'T YOU GIVE ME THIS SHIT, TOO. NOT YOU. WHO DO YOU THINK PULLED YOU OUT OF THOSE SHITHOLE CLUBS? WHO GOT YOU ON TELEVISION, ON LETTERMAN? I REMEMBER. YOU, WHO WASN'T BLONDE, WHO WASN'T FROM THE MIDWEST. 15 YEARS AGO, THIS TOWN, THE CARSON PEOPLE, THEY WOULDN'T LET YOU PLAY ON THEIR FIELD. SO I HAD TO MOVE THE GAME. SORRY, ASSHOLES, THE GAME'S OVER HERE NOW. I MOVED THE GAME. WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK FORCED CARSON OUT, SO YOU COULD GE THE BEST FUCKING JOB IN COMEDY? FORCED CARSON OUT, JOHNNY QUIT. SURE HE QUIT. BECAUSE HE COULDN'T TAKE THE HEAT ANYMORE. I GOT THE AFFILIATES ON YOUR SIDE. I GOT THE NETWORK TO KISS YOUR ITALIAN ASS. I GOT PAGE ONE OF THE FUCKING NEW YORK POS TO BURY THAT FOSSIL CARSON, ALL FOR YOU! WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU GOT PAGE ONE OF THE POST? YOU TOLD ME WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT STORY. OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, GROW UP. YOU LIED TO ME? WE'VE ALWAYS PLAYED THE SAME GAME. YOU NEVER WANT TO KNOW WHAT I'M DOING FOR YOU SO YOU CAN BE MR. NICE GUY. "BOOKING WAR, WHAT DO I KNOW? HELEN HANDLES THAT, I DO THE JOKES." YOU JUST WANT ME TO KEEP SERVING YOU STEAKS. YOU NEVER WANT TO KNOW HOW I'M SLAUGHTERING THE COW. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LIED TO ME. WE NEEDED THE STORY. IT HELPED US. I DID IT FOR YOU! I CALLED JOHNNY. I TOLD HIM IT DIDN'T COME FROM US. BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME THAT IT DIDN'T COME FROM US. I MEAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAD ME LIE TO JOHNNY CARSON. BIG FUCKING DEAL, SO GO TO FUCKING CONFESSION. I GOT A SHOW TO DO, HELEN. ( Helen ) GOD DAMN IT! ( screaming ) WHAT ARE YOU DOING? JAY, HONEY, LET'S GET THIS IRONED OUT. WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT WITH N.B.C. NO, THEY WANT YOU OUT. SO DO I. WHAT ABOUT TAKING CARE OF ME AND MY KID? YOU SAT THERE ON JERRY'S DEATHBED. YOU SAID "I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER." I HEARD YOU SAY THAT. I DID SAY THAT, I DID, AND I MEANT IT THEN. BUT NOW, HELEN, YOU ALMOS COST ME THIS JOB. YOU DON'T NEED THIS JOB. LISTEN, I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE. I GUARANTEE US A JOB, $25 MILLION. WE CAN WALK OUT OF HERE. GOODBYE, HELEN. DON'T YOU LEAVE ME, YOU TWO-FACED BASTARD! WHAT DO YOU... WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? WHAT DO YOU WANT... YOU WANT TO BREAK THIS? YOU WANT TO BREAK THIS! IT'S BROKEN. ( woman ) Warren Littlefield's office. YEAH, IT'S JAY, IS HE IN? Sure. ( Warren ) Jay? YEAH, WARREN, YOU GOT TO HELP ME THROUGH THIS. Absolutely. HELP ME. I'M MOVING FORWARD WITH YOU. I'M DOING THE SHOW. Great. SHE'S NO LONGER THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER. I'M NO LONGER IN BUSINESS WITH HELEN KUSHNICK. ( car honking ) I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME! WE GOT A GREAT SHOW TOMORROW NIGHT! ( audience cheering ) ( audience applauding ) ( chattering ) CAN YOU GUYS COME IN HERE, PLEASE? HEY, EVERYBODY, COME ON IN HERE. I JUST HAVE A FEW THINGS I WANT TO SAY. IT'LL JUST TAKE... IT'LL JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES, OK? GREAT SHOW TONIGHT, FIRST I SHOULD SAY THAT. SO I... I JUST, UH, WANTED TO JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO APOLOGIZE FOR ALL THE CRAZINESS THAT'S BEEN GOING ON AROUND HERE THE PAST FEW MONTHS. I... I LISTENED TO HELEN AND IT WAS A MISTAKE. AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, AND I'M SORRY FOR IT. SO PLEASE STAY WITH ME. I'LL TRY AND MAKE IT UP TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, AND LET'S JUST KEEP DOING THE BEST SHOWS THAT WE CAN DO. ALL RIGHT? ( all applauding ) SO TO YOU, I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ( man ) WAY TO GO, JAY. ( woman ) YOU'RE GREAT, JAY. ( woman ) WE'RE BEHIND YOU. ( cars honking ) ( whistling ) WHAT A PLACE. OH, MY GOD, THERE'S MORE FRUIT IN HERE! IS IT SCURVY? CAN YOU SEE I ON MY SKIN? UH, PETE, HAVE A SEAT, AND TAKE THAT SILLY RUG OFF, WILL YOU? MORTY, FOR GOD SAKE, STRAIGHTEN YOUR TIE, THIS ISN'T A TRACTOR PULL! ( both laughing ) ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. LET'S GET THIS THING STARTED. THESE ARE SUMMARIES OF ALL THE OFFERS DAVID HAS ON THE TABLE. THEY'RE ALL IN THE SAME RANGE, $12 TO $14 MILLION A YEAR DEPENDING ON HOW WELL YOU DO. WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE OF THOSE OVERSIZED SYNDICATION OFFERS LIKE THE $50 MILLION FROM VIACOM. AH, LISTEN, SYNDICATION GIVES ME THE, UH, WILLIES. I'M NOT, UH,... HE WANTS A NETWORK. NOW, A.B.C. PASSED BECAUSE WE WOULDN' ACCEPT MIDNIGH AFTER NIGHTLINE. FOX IS... WELL, FOX IS FOX. THEY'VE ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF A NETWORK AT BEST. SO THAT LEAVES US WITH C.B.S. SUDDENLY OUR OPTIONS ARE NARROWED. LISTEN, THE GOOD NEWS IS, DAVID, THAT C.B.S. HAS REALLY STEPPED UP. THEY'RE OFFERING YOU $12.5, BUT THAT WILL ESCALATE AS YOUR DEMOGRAPHICS IMPROVE. BUT WHAT DID THEY SAY ABOUT THE CLEARANCE ISSUE? I MEAN, LOOK, N.B.C. IS PUTTING THE TONIGHT SHOW, ON WHAT, 99% OF THEIR AFFILIATES... WE'LL ONLY GET ABOUT 65% OF THE AFFILIATES IN YEAR ONE. HOWARD STRINGER PROMISES THEY'LL GET IT UP TO 90% BY THE END OF YEAR 3, AT THE VERY, VERY LATEST. NOW, IN SPITE OF THESE LIMITATIONS, DAVE, I THINK THAT STRINGER IS AN EXTREMELY COMPETENT EXECUTIVE. IF YOU GO TO C.B.S., THERE IS NO DOUB THAT YOU WILL BECOME THEIR NUMBER ONE SIGNATURE STAR. AND I CAN'T PU A PRICE TAG ON THAT. THERE IS ONE PROBLEM THAT WE NOW HAVE TO DEAL WITH. AND THAT IS, THAT N.B.C. STILL HAS THE RIGH TO MATCH THIS OFFER WITHIN 30 DAYS. SO N.B.C. MATCHES THE OFFER, AND I'M... I'M STUCK AT N.B.C. AT 12:30 FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. NOT NECESSARILY. WE'VE COME UP WITH SOMETHING EXTRA. THE C.B.S. DEAL HAS A PENALTY CLAUSE. C.B.S. AGREES TO GIVE YOU A SHOW THAT AIRS BEFORE MIDNIGHT EASTERN TIME, OR THEY OWE YOU $50 MILLION. $50 MILLION. ( Morty ) THAT'S NO PENALTY, THAT'S CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. IT WILL NOT EVEN FAZE C.B.S., BECAUSE THEY'RE GIVING YOU 11.30 ANYWAY. BUT IT'S GOING TO MAKE N.B.C. CHOKE. ( chuckling ) COOL. IT IS C.A.A.'S FORMAL RECOMMENDATION THAT YOU ACCEP THE C.B.S. OFFER, AND SO INFORM N.B.C. CONGRATULATIONS, DAVE. ( snickering ) TAXI! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I GOT A DATE DOWNTOWN. REALLY, ANOTHER ONE, WHO'S LEFT? DAVID. YOU KNOW, THERE'S STILL ONE PROMISE THAT OVITZ HASN'T KEPT. WELL, MAYBE N.B.C. IS HAPPY WITH WHAT THEY GOT. IF N.B.C. WERE TO OFFER YOU THE TONIGHT SHOW, WOULD YOU STILL ACCEPT IT? WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION. OF COURSE I WOULD. I W-W-WANT THAT SHOW. I JUST WANTED TO HEAR YOU SAY IT AGAIN. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? PETE? DAVID. BOB WRIGHT IS HERE TO SEE YOU. HERE? MMM-HMM. HELLO, DAVID. HEY, BOB, HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING. UH, PETE, WHY DON'T YOU COME IN? I'M SORRY, I HAVE THINGS TO DO DOWN THE HALL. THANKS, PETER. YOU BET, BOB. HEY, BOB, UH, THANKS FOR COMING ON DOWN. OH, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME. YOU LIKE THAT? YOU WANT ONE? THERE YOU GO. OH, THANK YOU. YOU OWN IT. DAVID. I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE YOUR FAMILY HERE AT N.B.C. I'M HERE BECAUSE I WANT DESPERATELY TO PREVENT THAT. I WANT TO OFFER ANYTHING I CAN. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN OFFER TO GET YOU TO STAY? WELL, THOSE ARE WARM SENTIMENTS, BOB. THANK YOU. WELL, OF COURSE YOU KNOW I WOULD STAY, BUT YOU'VE ALREADY FILLED YOUR 11:30 SLOT. I CAN OFFER ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE. PRIME-TIME, SPECIALS... I KNOW, BOB, LISTEN. IT'S JUST, PRIME-TIME AND... I'M A CREATURE OF LATE NIGHT. YOU KNOW I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN, THAT'S WHO MY AUDIENCE IS. YOU KNOW, THE GUYS ON THE WEST COAST SAY THA YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE ADJUSTING TO 11:30. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, I... THOSE GUYS ARE ENTITLED TO THEIR OPINION, BUT I'M TELLING YOU I THINK THAT THEY ARE WRONG. AND I THINK THAT I AM READY. I'VE GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGH TO WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO SHIFT TO... TO AN 11:30 POSITION. I KNOW IT'S A DIFFERENT AUDIENCE. AND IF THAT MEANS, UH, BOOKING DIFFERENT TYPES OF GUESTS OR COUNTRY MUSIC MIXED IN WITH THE ROCK OR WHATEVER IT TAKES. UH, AND I CAN ALSO TEMPER MY OWN ACT. BOB, I'M A PROFESSIONAL, I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU CAN. AND I SEE THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT. WELL, I HAVE, UH, BUT, UH, GOOD. ALL THE SAME, I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IT'S TIME. I MEAN, I GOT TO MOVE UP. AND IF I DON'T DO IT NOW, I'M NOT EVER GOING TO DO IT. IT'S TIME TO MOVE. ( all chattering ) JOHN. BETTY. HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING NEW FROM OVITZ? NOTHIN' NEW, NOTHIN' OLD. LOTS OF NOTHIN'. GREAT. WARREN. SO, UH, WHAT'S WRIGHT SAYING? HE SAYS HE'S WAITING TO HEAR FROM OVITZ. HE'S LEANING TOWARDS LETTERMAN. I KNOW, I TOLD JAY, WEST COAST IS BEHIND HIM, BUT I CAN' SPEAK FOR NEW YORK. YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT BOCA? ONCE AGAIN, JAY AND DAVE ARE IN COMPETITION WITH ONE ANOTHER. YOU KNOW, NOW NEW YORK LIKES DAVE SO MUCH THEY DON'T WANT TO LET HIM GO. I MEAN, I LIKE DAVE. HE'S MY FRIEND. I LOVE THIS SHOW. I'M NOT ASKING THEM TO NOT LIKE DAVE. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE EITHER OR? THESE NETWORK GUYS... THEY CAN'T MAKE UP THEIR MIND. THEY THINK THEY CAN JUST FLIP A COIN. DAVE OR JAY, JAY OR DAVE. IT DOESN'T MATTER TO THEM. YOU THINK THE MEETING'S ABOU CHOOSING BETWEEN YOU TWO? I DON'T CARE WHA THE MEETING'S ABOUT AT ALL. I'VE GIVEN THEM EVERYTHING THEY'VE ASKED FOR. I'VE GIVEN THEM THE DEMOS, THE NUMBERS. IF I'M THE ONE GOING DOWN, I'M GOING DOWN SWINGING. HEY, WHERE'S RICK LUDWIN? HE LEFT TO BE IN ON THAT CONFERENCE CALL FROM BOCA. GUESS WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT. HEY, EVERYONE, I'M GONNA CUT THE POSTMORTEM A LITTLE SHORT TONIGHT. I GOT SOMETHING TO DO. IT WAS A GREAT SHOW, REALLY. THANKS. ALL RIGHT? I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW. DEBBIE, THANK YOU. AND I'LL, UH, I'LL SEE YOU AT THE HOUSE LATER. ALL RIGHT, OK, THANKS. ( door closing ) ( cat meowing ) ( man ) Are you reading us ok, can you hear us? YEAH, I HEAR YOU ALL FINE. We're all here, you settled in? You ordered the pizza yet? ( man laughing ) Thanks for joining us, Rick. I know it's late. We're all tired, but we're here to discuss and hear out everybody's opinion on what we should do about late night. I THINK THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED LONG BEFORE NOW. JAY HAS THE JOB, HE'S DOING GREAT. HE HAS A GREAT ATTITUDE. WHOA, WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE. I THOUGHT WE WERE HERE TO TALK THIS THING OUT. NOT TO DO SOME SELF-SERVING COMMERCIALS. I MEAN, IF YOU WAN THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER JOB THAT BAD, RICK, KISS JAY'S ASS IN PRIVATE, OK? I... I DIDN'T MEAN TO... WE ALL SEE THE JOB JAY IS DOING. ( Dick ) His selection of musical acts, UNORIGINAL COMEDY PAST THE MONOLOGUE. AND HIS PISS-POOR INTERVIEWING. WHICH, BY THE WAY, LOOKS LIKE IT WILL NEVER GET ANY BETTER. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE THINK IT WOULD REALLY COST US TO MATCH C.B.S.'S OFFER FOR LETTERMAN. AND ON THE OTHER HAND, IF LENO QUITS TO GO TO C.B.S., are we out from under the $10 million we'd owe him if we fired him? ( Dick ) Warren? ( Warren ) I've got some serious concerns here, AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST THROW OFF JAY WITH A COUPLE OF... OH, JACK! JACK, IT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME SO LATE. OH, PLEASE SIT. AND KEEP TALKING, EVERYBODY. I'M JUST HERE TO LISTEN. SORRY IT'S SO WARM, THE AIR CONDITIONING WENT OUT. UM, WARREN, WHY DON'T YOU CONTINUE? OH, ALL RIGHT. WELL, UH, MY FEAR IS THA LETTERMAN WON'T COOPERATE. IT ISN'T IN HIS PERSONALITY, HE'LL STIFF US. YOU KNOW, REMEMBER, THIS IS THE GUY WHO KICKS N.B.C. EXECUTIVES OUT OF HIS ANNIVERSARY PARTIES. THAT'S AN OLD STORY... EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME FOR A MINUTE. THERE'S STILL A SERIOUS QUESTION THAT HIS ACT CAN PLAY AN HOUR EARLIER. A LOT OF US THINK IT WON'T. AND DON'T FORGET. WITH LENO, WE OWN THE SHOW AGAIN. LETTERMAN WANTS TO OWN HIS SHOW. THEN HE HAS ALL THE ANCILLARY PROFITS. MAY I SAY SOMETHING HERE? JACK, PLEASE, OF COURSE. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A REGULAR LATE NIGHT VIEWER, SO I WOULDN' PRESUME TO MAKE A CALL ABOUT WHO'S THE BEST COMEDIAN. ALL I WANT TO SAY IS THIS, AS ALWAYS I'M FOR WHATEVER IS THE BEST BUSINESS DEAL. THAT'S FOR YOU, BOB, AND YOUR PEOPLE TO DETERMINE. HOWEVER, IF THE DECISION COMES DOWN TO A TIE ON ALL ANGLES, I'D CAST MY VOTE FOR LOYALTY. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, GOOD NIGHT, JACK. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR DROPPING BY. ( Bob ) I THINK THAT ABOUT WRAPS IT UP. WE'LL MEET AGAIN TOMORROW. ( Betty ) WHAT I AM WORRIED ABOUT IS WHAT WE WILL LOOK LIKE, IF WE THROW OU THE LOYAL DOG, WE'LL BE CAST AS OPPORTUNISTIC VENAL SHITS. IT'LL BE PAULEY-NORVILLE ALL OVER AGAIN. ( Bob ) BETTY, HOW THE HELL IS THIS PAULEY-NORVILLE? ( Jay ) HEY, WARREN, IT'S JAY. HOW'RE YOU DOING? HEY, I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY ALL TIRED FROM SITTING THROUGH THOSE BORING G.E. MEETINGS. I BET I'M CATCHING YOU JUST AS YOU WERE ABOUT TO SI DOWN ON THE TOILET. That was quite a meeting you had last night, you know that. I... I HOPE G.E. PROTECTS ITS NUCLEAR SECRETS BETTER THAN THEY PROTEC THEIR LATE NIGHT SECRETS. I, UH, I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO BAD TO HEAR THA DICK EBERSOL WAS NO JAY LENO FAN. ALTHOUGH IT WAS GOOD TO KNOW THAT, UH, JACK WELCH WAS IS IN FAVOR OF LOYALTY. YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS IT CAME DOWN TO A "TIE ON ALL ANGLES." HOLY SHIT, JAY. HOW THE HELL DID YOU GET YOUR INFORMATION? YOU KNOW, I MAY LOOK STUPID, BUT I'M ITALIAN. I... I KNOW HOW TO FIND INFORMATION. L-L-LISTEN, JAY, DON' TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS. WARREN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY, YOUR SECRETS ARE SAFE WITH ME. I WON'T BREAK THE G.E. CODE. LISTEN, JUST HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME IN BEAUTIFUL SUNNY FLORIDA. ( laughing ) ( water flushing ) BETTY, WE HAVE A SECURITY LEAK OF ENORMOUS PROPORTIONS. ( audience applauding ) Paul Shaffer, uh, ladies and gentlemen. ( David ) OOH, WELL, THAT SUCKED. LET'S SEE HOW BAD WE CAN WRITE TOMORROW'S. JOHN, YOU HAVE SOME TOP 10... YEAH, THE TOP 10 REASONS SINEAD O'CONNOR HATES THE POPE. NO, NO, NO, NO CAN DO. WE GOT A MEMO FROM N.B.C. STANDARDS AND PRACTICES IS RIP-SHI OVER HER TEARING THE POPE IN HALF ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE. ( David ) I DON'T CARE. WRITE THE JOKE. NO SINEAD O'CONNOR JOKES. AND NOW N.B.C.'S TELLING US WHAT JOKES WE CAN AND CAN'T DO? WHAT'S NEXT? THEY'RE GOING TO SERVE A TASTY HOT MEAL ON MY DESK? APPARENTLY. OH, FUCK. ALL RIGHT, UH, TOP 10 JOKES THAT N.B.C. WON'T LET US DO. PETER LIKED IT, PETER LIKED THAT JOKE. LAURIE, YOU LIKE THAT JOKE? YEAH. UH, MIKE OVITZ IS ON LINE ONE. ALL RIGHT, FELLOWS. LET'S GO. I GOT TO TAKE THIS CALL. GO ON, IT'S ADULT SWIM. GET OUT OF HERE. DON'T COME BACK, UH, UNTIL IT'S FUNNY. YOU GUYS WANT TO HEAR THIS? OH, YEAH. ALL RIGHT, YOU READY? YEAH. HIYA, MIKE, HOW ARE YOU? DAVE, ONE HOUR AGO BOB WRIGH CONVEYED TO US AN OFFER for you to host The Tonight Show. OH, YES! ( Mike ) Now don't jump to any conclusions. LET ME LAY ALL THIS OUT. The deal is 3 years with an option. THE SALARY RANGE IS $7 TO $12 MILLION. NOW HERE'S THE WRINKLE. The deal does not commence until May of 1994. 18 months from now. UH, WH-WH-WHAT'S ALL THAT ABOUT? IT'S RATHER TRANSPARENTLY N.B.C.'S ATTEMP TO KEEP BOTH YOU AND LENO, AT LEAST FOR A WHILE. THE MAY DATE, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, COINCIDES WITH THE END OF LENO'S CONTRAC AS THE HOST OF THE TONIGHT SHOW. ALL RIGHT. BUT I GET THE SHOW? YES. I JUST DON'T GET IT NOW? NO. I GET IT A... A YEAR FROM MAY? YES. AND, UH, THEY DON' FORCE JAY OUT, RIGHT? NO, UNLESS HE QUITS, WHICH I ASSUME THAT HE MIGHT. Maybe that's what they want him to do. JAY'S GOING TO QUIT? NOT A CHANCE. NOT A CHANCE. JESUS, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? LET ME POINT OU A FEW MORE THINGS. C.B.S. IS OFFERING MORE SALARY. C.B.S. is offering ownership. C.B.S. IS ALSO OFFERING FOR THE SHOW TO START IN THE FALL. N.B.C., THE FOLLOWING SPRING, MAYBE. WHAT'S THAT, WHAT'S "MAYBE"? I MEAN THE DEAL IS OBVIOUSLY VERY SMOKY IN MANY DETAILS. BUT I GET THE SHOW, RIGHT? NO, NOT NECESSARILY, DAVID. THE WAITING PERIOD GIVES JAY 18 MONTHS TO MAKE THE SHOW A HIT. AND IF HE DOES, YOU CAN BET N.B.C. WILL FIND A WAY TO WEASEL OUT OF THE DEAL. HONESTLY, C.A.A. SEES NO REASON TO CHANGE ITS RECOMMENDATION. MIKE, LISTEN. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. UH, IT IS EVERY DRIVER'S DREAM TO DRIVE A FERRARI. NOW YOU'RE ASKING ME TO GIVE THAT UP. WELL, I COULD PROBABLY BUY SOME TIME. THE N.B.C. DEADLINE IS MONDAY. I COULD GET AGOGLIA IN HERE ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, AND HAVE HIM START DRAWING UP... YES, YES, GET AGOGLIA IN THERE. I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ONLY GUY WHOSE WEEKEND IS RUINED BY THIS. HAVE AGOGLIA DRAG HIS TIRED ASS OVER TO C.A.A., WHILE I'M UP IN CONNECTICUT IN HELL, TRYING TO FIGURE OU WHAT THE FUCK I'M GOING TO DO WITH MY LIFE! ( woman ) DAVE. DAVE. ( David ) WHAT? HELLO, DAVID. AH! HI, PETE. WELCOME TO MY WEEKEND IN HELL. ( grunting ) NO MOVEMENT SINCE FRIDAY? NO. AND AGOGLIA'S NOT PUTTING ANYTHING IN WRITING. YEAH, OVITZ SAYS, UH, N.B.C. CAN'T TAKE THE RISK. THAT IT WOULD LEAK. AND JAY WOULD FIGURE OU THEY'VE OFFERED HIS JOB TO ME. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THE PRESS HEARD ABOUT THIS? DO YOU THINK JAY KNOWS? NO. HOW CAN HE? BUT IT IS WORTH THINKING WHAT IT WILL MEAN TO JAY IF YOU TAKE THIS. IT MEANS YOU'LL BE DENOUNCED IN THE PRESS FOR SHOVING AN OLD FRIEND UNDER A TRAIN. JEEZ! I MEAN, THA-THAT'S HORRIBLE. I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANYBODY ELSE? YEAH, I'VE TALKED TO EVERYBODY. I TALKED TO HAL, MORTY, ROB, JUDE. AND WHAT DID THEY SAY? THEY ALL, UH, THEY SAID THE SAME THING, IT'S A SHITTY DEAL. C.B.S. OFFERED A BETTER ONE. I TELL YOU, PETE, I'M STILL THINKING OF TAKING IT. I WANT THAT SHOW. WHAT SHOW? I DESERVE THAT SHOW. JOHNNY'S SHOW? DON'T YOU GET IT, DAVID? THEY ARE NOT OFFERING YOU THE JOHNNY CARSON TONIGHT SHOW. THAT IS GONE FOREVER. THEY'RE OFFERING YOU DAMAGED GOODS. THEY'RE OFFERING YOU THE JAY LENO SHOW. AND THEY'RE NO EVEN OFFERING IT NOW, THEY'RE MAKING YOU WAIT. I'VE LOST THAT SHOW ONCE, I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. I CAN'T. I JUST CAN'T SAY NO. THEN DON'T SAY YES YET. MAKE ONE MORE PHONE CALL. JESUS, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, I DON'T CARE. I CANNOT LOSE THE TONIGHT SHOW TWICE. ONCE TO JAY LENO. AND ONCE BECAUSE I WAS TOO DUMB TO TAKE A SECOND CHANCE. THEY'RE OFFERING ME A SECOND CHANCE, PETE. DAVID, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, I AM THE GUY THAT MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO GET YOU THAT SECOND CHANCE AND I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S NOT RIGHT. IT'S LEFTOVERS. IT'S SHODDY. CALL THE ONE GUY IN ALL THE WORLD WHO CAN HELP YOU FIGURE THIS OUT. ( telephone ringing ) HELLO. ( David ) Uh, Johnny, it's Dave. I, UH, I HATE TO BOTHER YOU ON A SUNDAY LIKE THIS BUT... I KNOW WHY YOU'RE CALLING, DAVE. UH, PETER FILLED ME IN ON THE N.B.C. OFFER. LISTEN, I JUST HATE TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT LIKE THIS, BUT YOU MAY BE THE ONLY GUY WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS THIS SORT OF THING AND I... WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK YOU GOT TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR CAREER. I MEAN, DO... DO WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART. WELL, IT'S JUST THOSE 2 THINGS SEEM TO BE IN... IN DIRECT CONFLICT HERE. IT'S JUST SO TOUGH. I... I JUST HAVE TO JUST ASK YOU STRAIGHT OUT, JOHNNY. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? WELL, DAVE, I WOULD PROBABLY WALK. NOW I'M NOT TELLING YOU TO DO THAT. But if you're asking me what I would do, IF I WAS TREATED LIKE THIS, YEAH, I, UH, I WOULD PROBABLY WALK. YEAH, I IMAGINE YOU WOULD, JOHNNY. UH, LISTEN, I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THIS. IT'S JUST AWFULLY NICE OF YOU AND I... I, UH... THANKS. GOOD LUCK, DAVE. Everybody wants to know what's going on in late night. And the answer is, the host of the Tonight Show will continue to be Jay Leno! ( motorcycle engine revving ) ( Jay ) Hey! ( chuckling ) ( Jay ) How're you all doing? Don't let these N.B.C. guys out of your sight. Hey, Warren, how are you? Welcome to N.B.C., which stands for "Never Believe your Contract." ( audience laughing ) You know they say, uh... They say that we live in a time of lowered expectations. They... they must be right because, look at this, you're all here and I have the job. What we're celebrating is that I haven't been fired. ( sighing ) OK. LET'S GO. IT'S OUR TURN NOW. ( Jay chattering ) ( honking ) HOLD IT. GENTLEMEN, WE'RE JUST GOING FROM ONE BIZARRE CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE NEXT. ( David ) I never dated Amy Fisher. ( audience laughing ) I helped her with her homework I... I fixed her car, and that's it. Thank you, good night. What about Paul Shaffer, is he coming along? Paul who? Paul Shaffer. Paul Shaffer. Oh, no, God, we forgot... We forgot about Paul. Howard, is there just a bit left over for Paul Shaffer? Dave, Dave, are you going to kick Jay Leno's ass? I'm going to kick your ass, buddy. ( woman reporter ) Isn't your comedy too hip for 11:30? ( camera clicking ) You people seem to be keeping up. ( Warren ) DO YOU REALIZE WHAT WE'VE GOT RIDING ON JAY LENO? A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY AND MY ASS. DAVE'S REALLY GOOD. I HOPE WE HAVEN' MADE A MISTAKE. ( There's No Business Like Show Business by Ethel Merman Playing ) THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS LIKE NO BUSINESS I KNOW ALL MADE UP AND SOON YOU'LL BE APPEARING EVERY BIT OF NERVOUSNESS IS GONE AND THE SOUND THAT'S MUSIC TO YOUR HEARING TO HEAR THEM CHEERING WHEN YOU COME ON THERE'S NO PEOPLE LIKE SHOW PEOPLE THEY SMILE WHEN THEY ARE LOW HOW I WISH THE FOLKS AT HOME COULD ONLY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ANNIE, HOW PROUD THEY'D BE GETTING PAID FOR DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY LET'S GO ON WITH THE SHOW
