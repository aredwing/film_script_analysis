At sea, the problems were still the same. In war, Germany could feed herself. England could not. If the ships bringing England's food could be sunk or immobilised. England would starve and the war would be won. For this the Germans had three powerful weapons, the magnetic mine, the U-boat, and the surface raider. These pocket battleships were strong and swift. There had never been anything like them. They were the tigers of the sea. Ten days before war was declared, one of these raiders sailed from a German port with secret orders. She sailed by night off the coast of Norway, passed unobserved through the Denmark Strait between Iceland and Greenland, and vanished into the southern Atlantic where a supply ship was already waiting for her. Months passed and nobody suspected that a killer was lurking there, until ship after ship failed to make its home port. Poor little Africa Shell. The fortune of war, Captain. Pirates! That's what you are. My ship was well inside Portuguese territorial waters. Complain to our captain. Captain Langsdorff. Complain? What's the use of complaining? You've sunk my ship. You've stolen my papers. My position was clearly marked on the chart. Your chart is inaccurate. Here, take a look at that. That's the coast of Portuguese East Africa, isn't it? We're still within the three-mile limit, aren't we? Look, there's Cape Zavora. There's the lighthouse on Quissico Point. You aren't blind. All I can see, Captain, are two of your lifeboats carrying all your crew to safety. So, you are the pocket battleship Graf Spee? Achtung! Der englische Kapitn, Dove, von der Africa Shell, Herr Kapitn. Danke. - Warten Sie hier, bis der Kapitn frei ist. - Leutnant. Well, Captain Dove? Well, Captain Langsdorff? How do you do, Captain? My boarding officer has reported your protest about the seizure of your ship. You say that you were in territorial waters. If you were, that makes it very difficult for me. Not half so difficult, sir, as it makes for me already. I've lost my ship and everything else. To my mind, there's not the slightest doubt I was well within the three-mile limit. - If I had my chart here, I could... - Here is your chart. - Please. Show me. - I will. Look here. There. See that line? It couldn't be clearer. We're not likely to agree, Captain. You want the figures to prove you right and me wrong, whereas I want... Shall we make a compromise? You write out your protest and I'll give you a receipt. Is that fair? That's fair enough, sir. Shall we drink? Scotch. Genuine. From the steamship Clement. Oh, so you sunk the Clement. Cigarette? Also genuine? Yes, but not from the Clement, I think. No. From the Huntsman. The captain of the Huntsman was a pal of mine. Is, Captain. Is. What, is he on board? Well, not exactly. Believe me, Captain, I don't like sending ships to the bottom. What sailor does? Nor do I like making war on civilians. Up till now, it's the civilians who have suffered in this war. The Army are sitting in armour and concrete, broadcasting to each other. The airmen are making reconnaissance flights, and the sailors... Take me, for example. I'm in command of a fine ship, a new ship, one of the finest battleships afloat. - We are fast. - 25 knots. More. I have immense fire power. Six 11-inch guns and... ...eight or ten five-inch. Well, you use your eyes. And my orders are to sink merchant ships and avoid a battle. You never know your luck, Captain. One of these days, you might run up against one of ours. You have only three ships that can catch me. Repulse, Renown and Hood. On paper. Your big battleships are not fast enough to catch me. - Plenty of our cruisers are faster than you. - They can't match my guns. On paper. I have one other advantage, Captain. The vastness of the sea. - It's very difficult to find me. - I can appreciate that, sir. I don't understand how your supply ship can ever hope to find you. - She can't. I find her. - Well, isn't that just as difficult? It's the simplest thing in the world, Captain. The details are secret, but the method is very old. The ocean is divided into squares, and I know exactly in which square my supply ship will be on a certain date. - Very interesting. - I know exactly what you're thinking. But the charts are safe, and so are you, for the duration. So, you see, I can hunt the seven seas from the North Pole to the South. Well, I hope you won't go as far as that, sir. I'm not quite dressed for it. We'll get our tailor to make you something warmer. - Oh? So, we are going south? - Perhaps. Would you like to see over my ship? I might as well. I've got an hour or two. My master-at-arms will show you to your quarters. Hier ist Gesund. Alles klar. - How do you do? - Der hat es da. Der Mensch ist ein kuhler Junge. Achtung! Achtung! Leutnant Becker melden Sie sich bei dem Kommandant. Leutnant Becker melden Sie sich bei dem Kommandant. Leutnant Becker melden Sie sich bei dem Kommandant. Sorry, Captain, we've sighted another merchantman. I must ask you to come to your quarters. Ich bringe ihn. Follow me, please. Lassen wir uns ihn holen. Was haben wir hier denn erwischt? - Very nice. - Ja. Midshipmen's quarters. - Very nice and spacious. - Mm-hm. - You will be with 29 other officers here. - 29?! Yes. When we meet our supply ship, all officer prisoners will be transferred here. Oh. I'd better pick my corner first. We are taking you home for Christmas. Oh, that's jolly. When? Oh, sometime. Soon. From the tailor. Kapitn Langsdorff says you put them on, you come on deck. There she is. Our supply ship. - Hier kommt die Leine. - Unterstehen! - Los! Mach! Mach! Los, Jungs! - Zwei. - Da. Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull. Lutze, hast du Kaffee fr uns? Ja, besten ersatz, Mensch. Good morning. Good morning, Captain. Kind of you to let me come on deck. I thought you might be interested. Ja, das ist gut. Es! Es! Er wars! Er wars! I am. Der Sack ist geplatzt. Rosinen, Mensch! Rosinen, Mensch. For you, Kapitn. Go on. Take it. Thanks, I will. Looks as if Father Christmas has arrived. Yes. Fresh meat, green vegetables, fruit, and some fuel. Captain Dove, Santa Claus. Alt... Altmark. Not very well camouflaged. Now, we do things much better. For example, we rig this up for neutrals. One day, I am the Deutschland. Herumwenden. The next, I am the Admiral Scheer. Neutrals always report what they see, so I keep your Navy interested. I'm like a pretty girl. I change my frock, I change my hat, I am a different girl. This is going to be my new funnel. Canvas. And over there, a new turret. Wood. Leutnant Hirth! Wo ist das Buch, Jane's Fighting Ships? Hier, Herr Kapitn. Oh. Jane. Yes, Jane. A very useful publication. - That is our new silhouette. - An American heavy cruiser. So that's why you've got a number painted on your bows. - Do you think you'll get away with it? - Enough to avoid recognition. Five minutes at 28 knots makes all the difference between in range and out of range. There are only two things to remember in a modern naval battle. Good intelligence from shore, so that you know what to expect when you see it. Good spotting on your own ship, so that you know what you see when you expect it. Talking of silhouettes, I must congratulate you on your tailor. - That's not bad. - Thanks. I want you to look your best, Captain. I'm transferring to the ship all the officers who are prisoners on the Altmark. Oh? May I ask why, sir? Yes. The Graf Spee is being relieved by... ...another vessel. We've finished our turn of duty. Three months, Captain. We're going home for a bit of leave. I must take my prisoners with me. You'll have company tonight. Weg da, Papa. Aber nur immer mit der Ruhe. - Die Jungen haben es immer eilig. - Heraus. Zu Befehl. Die Koffer da. - Ach, das is schwer. - Das kannst du mal wieder sagen. I really ought to be in my own uniform to meet the boys. Hier. Hier. Liverpool. Hull. Cardiff. Hier! This way. Newcastle. I say. They had more time to pack than I had. - Come on. Stop shoving. - Newton Beech first. Come on, lads. - Quick. Grab one of the corners. - Come on. Corners are cosy. Come on. Newton Beech over here. Trevanion, over here. - Huntsman. Where's the Huntsman? - We're right here. - Where's Trevanion? Trevanion? - Over here. - Captain. - All Tairoa around this table. Good evening, Captain. - Why, you're one of us. - I thought you were a Jerry. No, I'm Dove, Africa Shell. - Glory be. A new face. - When were you sunk? November 15th. Indian Ocean. - Any others with you? - I was the last they sunk. They only took me. Not a kill for nearly three weeks. She must be getting hungry. - How have they treated you? - Quite all right. - How's the captain? - What's the old man like? Fine. Fine. He's a gentleman. Not like our fellow Dau on the Altmark. - He was a proper swine, a real... - It was a ficating ruddy hell. Our men like cattle in the hold. Just four walls and a stinking bucket. - Yeah. - Auf Wiedersehen. Auf Wiedersehen. Raus. This is going to be no pleasure cruise, either. Hello? Well, that's a bit of luck. The chippy's left the screw holes unstopped. Very thoughtful of him. You know, when I was all alone, I fancied company. Now, I'm not so sure! She's moving, boys! Yes, yes. She's under way. - Well, who are you all? - Let's have a muster. - Huntsman. - Newton Beech. - Ashlea. - Tairoa. Trevanion. All present and correct. Africa Shell. Who's next? If only we could get out of here! - Shut up! - Yes, shut your great big mouth. Rats in a trap. That's what we are. Rats in a trap! - Some rat! - Hey, now. Don't start any trouble. Shut up, everybody. - Here comes old Zoonk. - Now we'll know who's been bumped this time. Gentlemen, the fight is finished. Fight? What fight? - We have zoonk her. - Sunk her. Nicht, nicht, nicht. Doric Star kaputt. - That's old Stubbs. - The Doric Star's a perishing mid boat. We might get a good feed out of this. - She only had a four-inch mounted aft. - Poor old Stubbs. - Wait till the Navy finds you. - We wait. - I hope you picked up the crew. - You shelled her long enough. - Soon you have lots more friends here. - Where will they put them? Oh, plenty room here. Ja, ja. Plenty room here. Weggehen! Herein! Kommen Sie. This way, please. Welcome aboard, Captain. I'm Dove, Africa Shell. - I'm Stubbs. Doric Star. - We know. We got the buzz from Zoonk. - Pottinger. Ashlea. - Hello, Stubbs. Why, it's John Robinson. Welcome to the Arab quarter. - Remember me? Murphy. - Caught you with your pants down, eh? Sorry for this get-up. No time to get my gear. It's a punishment for using my radio. You had them on the run all afternoon. - Did you get through, Sparks? - No doubt about it. - Did they board you, Captain? - No, we scuttled her. Another meatless day. Very brave, but very foolish. You are lucky you didn't get zoonk. - Zoonk? Zoonk? - Auf Wiedersehen. We reserved table tops for captains. Engine-room staff below. Bring any soap, chiefy? Soap? No soap. No time. Some of us haven't seen a paper for a month. - Where's it come from? - BA. Which half will you have, Stubbs? - Do you read Spanish? - It's the racing page. - I'm not interested in horses. - Neither am I. Listen. Pipe down. # Tnt es laut von fern und nah. # Old Zoonk-zink having a zing zong. # Christ der Retter ist da. # The Huddersfield Choral Society. What's he got round his neck? # Christ, der Retter ist da. # - You're a bit early for Christmas, aren't Zoonk? - What's all this about? - # Stille Nacht. # - What's he got there? - # Heilige Nacht. # - Here, Taffy, is it like this in Wales? # Gottes Sohn, o, wie lacht. # # Lieb' aus deinem gttlichen Mund. # # Da uns schlgt die rettende Stund'. # # Christ in deiner Geburt. # # Christ in deiner Geburt. # Kapitns und Officers, today is St Nicholas' Day, when we, in our country, hang up our stockings. We have only one Christmas tree and that is for our own men, but we have plenty decorations. A present from Kapitn Langsdorff. Come. Enjoy yourselves. - Give us a mask. - Here you are. Achtung! Achtung! Achtung! Party's over, children. It's a silent night for some poor beggar. Did you hear that? Another little ship for Uncle Adolf's stocking. This is funny. - Getting interested in racing, Stubbs? - Very funny. Funny? You mean the names they saddle on those poor ruddy horses? South America. You'd expect funny names. That's what I mean. All these horses racing in BA, Rio and Monte, - and you find more British names than Spanish. - They talk Portuguese in Rio. Ajax? Achilles? What's British about that? They look more like Greek to me. What names did you say? Ajax, Achilles, Salvador, Exeter, Punta Umbria, Cumberland. - They're not horses. They're cruisers. - I know the Achilles. It's a Kiwi cruiser. It's the South American Squadron. Commodore Harwood's squadron. What a coincidence! Coincidence, my Aunt Fanny! That's how it's done. - This is shipping news, not racing news? - Intelligence. - They've got spies everywhere. - So have we. - They get their news in the papers. - Their people read it. - They pass it on to the Graf Spee. - Langsdorff alters course. What can we do with our six and eight-inch cruisers against a big beggar like the Graf Spee? Yeah, with 11-inch flippin' guns. One of these days, you may find out. Ajax, Achilles, Exeter. We've no more chance of finding them than a needle in a haystack. Cheer up, Stubbs. Three needles in a haystack. Steady. Steady on 320. - Staffy. - Yes, sir? Make to Achilles and Exeter, "I would like to see you 1100 today on board flagship." - Put a time of origin on that. - Aye-aye, sir. - Got the charts prepared? - Yes, sir. They're all ready. Flag deck. Make to Exeter. Flagship signalling sir. Flagship, chief. From the flagship, sir. Bobby. I shall want the sea boat later. A commodore calling a council of captains at sea. Quite the Nelson touch, eh? Flag deck. Make to Achilles. - Pilot. - Sir? I shall want the sea boat to go to Ajax in about half an hour. Yes, sir. We haven't had much opportunity to exercise the sea boat recently. No, sir. You think they'll drown us all? It's back to the sheep farm for them if they do. Have you any idea, sir, what the commodore intends to do with us, now that he's got three ships to play with? Sir, we shall be carrying out squadron manoeuvres. Yes, well, that won't do us any harm, will it? - Chief Yeoman. - Sir? - Keep your eye on the flagship. - Aye-aye, sir. If I know the old man, we shall soon find out. Now come on. Don't let the Kiwis beat you to the flagship. Take it up. Exeter, sir. Hello, Bell. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. You know Woodhouse, don't you? - Haven't seen you for years. - Not since that football game at Twickenham. I'll take care not to leave you two together. Hookie'll be tipping you off about my bad habits when I flew my broad pennant in Exeter. Achilles, sir. - Good morning, sir. - Glad to see you, Parry. - Woodhouse. - Hookie, I don't think you know Parry. How do you do? How are your New Zealanders shaping? 500 individualists. - Hookie. - Sir? That defect list and list of spares for Exeter that I asked you to get out and send to base. - Has it gone yet? - Er, no. Not yet, sir. - What's the delay? - I'm sorry, sir. It's not completed yet. I'll have it finished today. Complete it and have it put on board the first merchant ship that can take it. Well, let's start. Come on, Parry. Please smoke if you want to. Oh, thank you. I've erm... I've taken the rather unusual course of sending for you, because I wanted to see you and give you personally my appreciation of the situation. I've ordered this concentration here, off the River Plate, because of news that I've received. of the latest movements of a German surface raider that's at large in the South Atlantic. I'd like you to look at the chart. The Admiralty have good information that this pocket battleship... ...it may be the Admiral Scheer or the Graf Spee or the Deutschland... ...sailed from Kiel on August 21st. She took up position well before war was declared. Up to September 30th, she attacked no shipping. I can guess why not. Hitler thought that after the fall of Poland, Britain and France would make peace. However, on September 30th, she sank the Clement, here off Pernambuco. She immediately left this area for the mid-Atlantic, where, between October 5th and 10th, her victims were the Newton Beech, the Ashlea and the Huntsman. Once again, she left this area hurriedly to proceed to the west coast of Africa, where she sank the Trevanion. Again she moved to a new hunting ground and rounded the Cape into the Indian Ocean. Presumably to attack the Cape-India-Australia routes. But she only sank a small tanker, the Africa Shell, here, in the Mozambique Channel. She then presumably doubled back because, some days ago, she sank the Doric Star there. As she knows that the Doric Star managed to get off a signal that she was being attacked, it's obvious that the raider will want to get out of that area as soon as possible. Now. In my opinion, she will do one of three things. One, she'll double back again into the Indian Ocean, two, she'll try and slip back to Germany as she came out, through the Denmark Strait. Or three, before returning home... ...she'll come over here, to our part of the world, where she should have been all the time, to make a last killing among the grain ships and meat cargoes of South America. And it's my instinct that's exactly what she'll do. Making a guess at her probable speed, I estimate that if she were making for Rio, she'd be there this morning, December 12th. If she's making here, for the River Plate, and that's what I believe... ...she'll be here 24 hours later. Tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow. My object is destruction of the enemy. My intention? To attack at once, day or night. She can outgun us and outrange us. So, as soon as we sight the beast... ...we will close at maximum speed, and divide her fire by attacking on separate flanks. Ajax... and Achilles will attack in close company. Exeter will attack on her own. In this way, besides splitting the enemy's main armament, we can also report each other's fall of shot. I wish I had the Cumberland. I could do with another eight-inch cruiser. She's still refitting at the Falklands. She won't join us for a fortnight. Tell your ships' companies they've got to be on their toes for the next few days. Search for any defect that might reduce fighting efficiency and have it dealt with. We will exercise my tactics for engaging a pocket battleship, both in daylight and after dark today. Staffy, where's the sun? Well over the yardarm, sir. Then open the gin. Tell the gunnery officer to sweep the horizon now. Guns. Sweep the horizon both sides. Right. - Stacey. - Sir? Train right. Dorset. Dorset! A fair day. Should be good visibility, sir. Oh, what a lovely dream I was having. - Who was she? - No, it wash't a she. No talking, you, Archer and Barnes. It was him I was dreaming of. - Him? - Yeah. - I was staying at the Ritz hotel in London. - Go on. Our chief buffer was the hall porter. I sent him out in the pouring rain for a taxi and when it came, I said, "Fetch me another one, my man. I don't like the colour." Time? 4:50, sir. Anice gentle breeze. Going to be a perfect day. - Good morning. - Is it? I didn't notice. - Switches off. - Switches off. - Petrol on. - Petrol on. - Throttle set. - Throttle set. Contact. Contact. Here she comes, the old tiddy-oggy. Well, today's the day. Yes. - Captain, sir. - Yes, Guns? Horizon clear. Thank you. All right to fall out from action stations, sir? Better wait for the flagship. Full visibility now, sir. Nothing in sight. Third-degree readiness, sir? All right, Pilot. Cruising stations. - Bosun's Mate. - Sir? - Sound the disperse. Sound off cruising stations. - Aye-aye, sir. Signal flying. Assume third-degree readiness. Close up the cruising watch. Bugler. Bugler! Here, sir. - Sound the disperse. - Aye-aye, sir. To quote Shakespeare freely... "The ides of December are come." "Ay, Caesar, but not gone." - 6:10, sir. - Hm? Oh. - I shall be in my cabin. - Aye-aye, sir. - Keep a sharp lookout. - Aye-aye, sir. And especially on the flagship. I'm going down for a shave and a bath. Keep an eye on everything. And two eyes on the commodore. Snotty, go and work out the time of moonrise tonight. Shall I bring those papers to sign after breakfast? Yes. - Torps. - Sir? - Let me know immediately you see anything. - Aye-aye, sir. - You fellows, keep your eyes skinned. - Aye-aye, sir. Well... You heard. - Lookouts on the watch closed up, sir. - Very good. Smoke! Bearing red 100. Smoke. Bearing red 100. - Captain, sir. - Yes? Smoke. Bearing red 100. Very good. Commodore, sir. Smoke. Bearing red 100. - From the northwest? - Yes, sir. - Tell Exeter to investigate. - Aye-aye, sir. - Chief Yeoman. - Sir? Make to Exeter, "Investigate smoke. Red 100." Aye-aye, sir. - Alter course to north. - Chief. Another signal from flagship, sir. "Have you dispatched list of spares? If smoke ours, put list aboard for base." Very good. That list of spares again, eh? That's going to annoy the old man. Mr Lewin, sir. Can you see those upper works? Looks like a pocket battleship. Oh, don't be so ruddy ridiculous. That's the third pocket battleship you've seen since Sunday. Go on. It's a pocket battleship. - Captain, sir, will you come on deck? - Very good. I can see control tower. I'm sure I can. - I've been on big ships. - So you're always saying. Penny-Feather, can you make her out? - A lot of haze, sir. - Clear as day, sir. - Get up top. See what you can see from there. - Aye-aye, sir. Exeter signalling, sir. Flag five. "Enemy in sight." Warn the aircraft crew. It is! A pocket battleship. - That's new. I've never heard that before. - They've bought something this time. Sound the alarm. - Warn the engine room. Connect all boilers. - Connect all boilers. - Both engines, full speed ahead. - Both telegraphs, full speed ahead. Captain, sir. I think the Scheer is on our port beam. Very good. Sound off action stations. Sound the alarm. Bugler! Sound off action, followed by the double. - Hoist battle ensigns. - Aye-aye, sir. - 28 knots. - 240 revolutions. - Port 20. - Port 20. Alter course 40 degrees towards her. Port 20. - Speed 28 knots. - George two eight. 210 revolutions. Flag deck. Hoist battle ensigns. Make to Admiralty from Commodore, South Atlantic, "I am engaging pocket battleship." - Give them our reference position. - Snotty, position? Unship that damned thing. - Full speed, Signal Officer. - Execute. Guns, open fire as soon as you're ready. - Pass the word to all parts of the ship. We're engaging a pocket battleship. - Right, sir. - Well, Commander, there she is. - I'll go round all quarters and ginger them up. By George! Look at Exeter's battle flags. - Steady. - She's dressing ship. - They're manning the 5.9s. - They're bringing up shells on the hoists. - They don't look so cocky now. - She's up against something her own size. I hope it's one of our big chaps. It'll blow this tin can right out of the water. - Aye, and us with it. - Yeah. Yeah, I keep forgetting that. - Abandon ship! - Keep calm. We haven't been hit. - That was the first of the mid's salvo. - We'd better get down on the deck. - Steer as near as you company the enemy, but keep our real are observer. - Yes, sir. Time? 6:18, sir. - Bearing 359. - Bearing 359. We've split her fire, all right. Their gunner is very accurate. They've straddled us with their first salvo. Better put your umbrellas up. GCT bridge, we are about to open fire. - Opening fire, sir. - Good. What about the depth charges, sir? If we get a direct hit, they'll blow our stern off. - May I jettison them? - By all means. - Prepare to catapult aircraft. - Aircraft platform prepare to catapult aircraft. - Torpedoes ready for firing, sir. - We will soon be within range. What? Thanks. I can't understand what their captain's doing. If you've got a longer reach than the other fellow, why get in close? Broadsides. Well done, the Royals. We're opening fire, sir. At last. Ajax opened fire, sir. - Maximum range. - Not for long, sir. - Alter course to starboard. - Aye-aye, sir. Starboard 20. - Guns. - Yes, sir? I shall always steer towards last fall of shot. - So be prepared to correct accordingly. - Yes, sir. - Understand, Pilot? - Yes, sir. I hope the enemy doesn't, sir. Midships. Open fire as soon as you can, Guns. We're opening fire now, sir. Steady. - OK. Stand by. - What? Now? Yes. We're going to stooge off between salvos. You've only got a ten-second gap. With a six-inch shell up our tail, we'll do it in six. That was a near one. Exeter's straddling. - Got her range. - So have we. They've straddled us. We'll know when we've been hit, all right. See what I mean? Hooray! Hit 'em again! Have you finished? Then help me down, will you? # There's no place like home... # Very funny. Give the gentleman a prize. A bag of nuts or a cigar. - Hey, what's that smell? - It's octane spirit. Put out that cigarette, you fool! - The spotting plane's been hit. - It's bang overhead. They've got the range now. - If that petrol goes up... - We'll get burnt to a crisp. - Like Yorkshire pud. - What's wrong with Yorkshire pud? When I'm done this side, will you turn me over? Enemy altering course towards us, sir. That suits us. She's concentrating all her main armament on the Exeter now, sir. The devil she is! We're the main target now, sir. A direct hit on the paint shop, sir. First-aid party, forward. Come on! - Who's that running on the forecastle? - Looks like Morse. Right! - Pass the word to all parts of the ship that we're hitting the enemy as hard as they are hitting us. - Yes, sir. Pilot. Direct hit on Exeter, sir. - Looks like the forward turret. - Oh, God. Pilot, alter course. Pilot! Chief Yeoman? Helmsman? Helmsman! Lower steering position. Lower steering position. Morgan? Petty Officer Jones? Roper? All right, Roper? First-aid parties, on the bridge. Hello, Bobby. Thank God, you're all right. Big fire between decks. We're coping. - "B" turret? - Out of action. Nearly all killed. A direct hit ripped off the armour. You caught most of it. If the fire spreads, flood the magazines. - I came as soon as I could, Captain. - There's plenty of work for you just here, Padre. Come on. Hurry. Hurry! I'm going to the after conning position. Look. - What the devil...? - Sorry, Bobby. The captain must have a hat. Use your Sunday best. Come on, Roper. - How's it going, Tom? - It's all right, Padre. We'll make you more comfortable in a minute. The boy... The boy's worse than me, sir. - If you see the commander, send him to me aft. - Aye-aye, sir. Exeter completely disappeared in smoke and flames! Oh, for half a dozen destroyers! That last one was very near the bridge. - Are you all right, chum? - Yeah. - Hello, Smith. - Sir. The bridge has had it. I'm going up to the after conning. How are things? Most of the torpedo crews are killed or wounded. - Any spare hands? - Yes. On the job now, sir. - All communications are cut, sir. - I'll fight the ship from here. Gyrocompass? - Failed, sir. - Get a boat's compass. One up here. One down below with the standby helmsman. How are you going to transmit orders? It's three decks down. - Form a chain of men. Jump to it. - Yes, sir. By God, she's firing again with her other two turrets! Good old Hookie. - You sent for me, sir? - I did. I want... - What the hell's this? - Petrol from the punctured aircraft. We're trying to get it over the side. Another flash from the after turret and we'll go up like Joan of Arc. - I've taken over from the chief, sir. - Stay by me. - McBarnett, sir. - You take over navigation. - Right, sir. Pass your orders through my messenger. - Stand by, Roper. - Sir? Achilles turning under smoke, sir. She's firing at Achilles with her 5.9s now. Yeah. And straddling us with her 11-inch. Throw her off to starboard for a couple of minutes, then come back to port again. That ought to throw her gunnery out. - All right, Pilot, starboard 15! - Starboard 15! Bridge GCT. Bridge GCT. - Where did it get you, Mr Watts? - My legs. It's in my legs. Bridge GCT. - Now, sir, the other leg. - That one's all right. It isn't. There's a hole right through it. Good Lord! I never noticed that. Gunnery Control Tower out of action, sir. No, we're not! Control Bridge. Tell the Captain we're regaining control. Please send first-aid parties. - Come on, Richard. - Eh? - Running repairs. - What? Oh. Come on. Come on. "A" turret's ceased firing, sir. What about the after turret? She's still firing. - Jennings is directing the fire standing on top. - Good. Enemy coming straight for us, sir. Port 20! - Port 20. - Port 20. Port 20. Port 20. - Midships. - Midships. Midships. - Steady. - Steady. Steady. Steady. - It nearly drowned us, sir. - Yes, but at least we won't fry. You should have worn your hat. Observer to Achilles. You're falling short. What's wrong with your sights? You, Shaw, are you all right? Shaw! Archie's had it, sir. Rogers, take over Shaw's job. The after turret's ceased firing, sir. - You sent for me, sir? - How are things down below? - Engines and boilers still intact, sir. - More than we are. Enemy closing in rapidly, sir. Not a gun or a torpedo left. Exeter altering course to starboard, sir. - Listing to starboard. - She's out of control. What's our range? - 16,000. - In we go, Woodie! To hell with battle instructions. We've got to draw his fire off Exeter. - At this range, we might as well bombard the beast with snowballs. - Aye-aye, sir. Straight for her, Pilot. Port 20. Make to Achilles, "Speed 30 knots." George 30. Flag deck hoist George 30. - What's the range now? - 132, sir. Tell the chief to speak. She's closing in to finish Exeter. Come on, Woodie. I must have utmost speed. Chief, give us all you've got. She means to finish us off. Well, Bobby, there's only one thing left. If she gives us half a chance, I shall try and ram the beggar. - Yes, sir. - It'll be the end of us, but it means the end of her also, and that's all that matters. Range down to 10,000 yards now, sir. Right. Now, give her the lot! - Hard to starboard. - Hard to starboard. Midships. Steady. Ah. - Middle. - Hard. - Yeah! Hit midships. - Take that, you beast. - A hit! - A hit on the superstructure. A hit again! Well done, Rogers. Easy, sir. I run a coconut shy back home. Well, get stuck in and do it again. A direct hit on our 5.9. Ha, ha! What price snowballs now? - We've done it. She's altering course. - Keep after her. Well done, Guns. Her firing's getting ragged, Woodie. We must be hurting... Captain, sir. "X" turret out of action, sir. "Y" turret jammed. We're working on it. - All right, Guns. - You've still got two left. Captain, sir. From "X" turret. Fire in ammunition hoist. - See if it's under control. - Aye-aye, sir. - Captain, sir. - Yes, Guns? We've fired nearly 1,200 rounds, sir. About one third of the outfit only remaining. Thank you. Are you all right? There are a few new ventilation gaps here, sir. A bit draughty. Otherwise, all right, sir. Time? 07:40, sir. We must open the range, Woodie. Turn stern onto her and make smoke. Starboard 30. Make smoke. Starboard 30! - From Exeter, sir. - What? "All guns out of action. We are still seaworthy." 07:32. She must be in a pretty grim condition. I wonder if she can make the Falklands. Captain, sir. Captain, sir! - Yes? - We've got four torpedoes left in port tubes. Fire 'em if you get a chance. Right, sir. A message from the commodore, sir. The commodore asks, can we reach the Falklands? Reply. "Can reach Plymouth, if ordered." - Yeoman. - Sir? Add... "Request permission to revise list of spares." "Revise list of spares." Hookie Bell. Well, if anybody can make it, he will. Signal. "Proceed Falklands. Godspeed." Aye-aye, sir. Do you think it's all over? No firing for a quarter of an hour. - More like half an hour. - I checked it on my watch. I wonder what made us put our caps on. - Yes, you're right. - Added protection. By Jove, I'd give anything to know. Do you think our ships are sunk? - Not likely. - We shouldn't be hurrying like this if they were. What's she going to do, eh? She's not turning after us, anyway. We'll keep on shadowing her from either quarter. I'm starving. You wouldn't go and see if there's any food? - Why don't you do it, Ralph? - What? In my condition? All right. Anybody hurt? Tony of Tairoa is dead. There's a bleeding great hole in the roof. Look! - Only scratches here. - Seems all right. Well, that's the luckiest thing ever. It must have struck the deck beam. But for that beam, we'd have had it. Who said the Graf Spee had sunk our ships? We're right on her tail! You mean, they're right on our tail. My soul is out there with the boys. - I wish I was. - I'm going to take a look. Give me a hand. You did order toast, didn't you, madam? - All right, Dove? What can you see, Dove? - What can you see? That was the forward turret. She's not done yet. That means "Keep off the grass." - Better do a bit of altering course, sir. - Yes. - Starboard 10. - Starboard 10. And be ready to close in and finish her when the light fails. Keep her between us and the afterglow. She'll be silhouetted against the western sky. We'll be in the cover of the dark. Do you hear that? They're moving in for the kill. Do you think you can get that light going? No. The cable aft must be cut. What about the Christmas decorations? There are some paper lanterns among them. Has anybody got a match? Should we use them now or save them till later? We might not need them later. I'm lighting this one to my guardian angel. - She's easing down, boys. - You're right, chief. What do you make of that, Peter? She's stopped. - Stopped? - Yes. Yes, she's stopped. That's right. Langsdorff's going to let our chaps dash past him in the dark, then turn in his tracks and slip out to sea again. That's it. By morning, he'll be miles out at sea. If only we could do something. Quiet! - Achtung! - Listen. Gentlemen... ...for you the battle is over. What do you mean? We are now in Montevideo harbour. So... So, Captain Langsdorff has told me to tell you that as we are in the neutral country of Uruguay... ...according to international law, you will all be set free tomorrow! Senor Mike! Senor Mike... What? - Speak up! - I said, come quick. The German pocket battleship the Graf Spee has anchored in the outer harbour. - There has been a battle. - A battle? Wow! Ciao. Ouch! - Un momentito, por favor. - Coca, get me New York! - And there's nothing I won't do for you. - That's what you will do. Nothing. Si, un momentito, por favor. Coca? For Mike? Senor Mike! But how can I? All the lines are busy. Every newspaperman from Buenos Aires, Rio and Santiago wants a room. - Newspapermen! Let them sleep in the gutter. - Si, lo conecto. - Un momentito. - Come on, Coca. I want NBC, CBC, ABC... - Si, si, si. - I know. The whole alphabet. Your Uncle Mike is going to report history and report it hot. Senor Mike! - Come on, Coca. Don't be difficult. - Senor Mike, por favor... No! Senor Mike! Oh! Senor Mike! All I can promise you at this stage, Your Excellency, is to send a commission of experts on board your ship, Captain Langsdorff, to assess the damage she has received. Heil Hitler. His Excellency the British Minister. - My dear Dr Guani. - My dear Millington-Drake. The Uruguayan government, with its well-known democratic principles, will act in accordance with international law and intern the Graf Spee for the duration of the war? His Excellency the French Charge d'Affaires. Monsieur Desmoulins. Your Excellency. I suppose another note? By the terms of the Hague Convention. Ah, the much-quoted Hague Convention. Gentlemen. Article 17 says that "Warships of belligerents may make no repairs in the ports and roads of neutrals beyond those necessary for safety at sea, and may not in any way increase the fighting efficiency of the vessel." May I bring to your notice the fact that, since the battle, the Graf Spee has already sailed 300 miles? At top speed. Mon Dieu! Elle couru comme un lapin. Gentlemen, since midnight, I have received three diplomatic notes from the German minister, two from the British and two from the French. We are only a small nation, which has imposed upon itself the heavy burden of neutrality. Do not, I beg you, make it any heavier. Forgive me for asking, but... ...do you think you will be able to enforce your country's decision? That is it. And where are the guns of the Graf Spee trained? Not on the enemy. All are trained on the city of Montevideo. Force majeure, my dear Guani, force majeure. Monsieur Desmoulins. Mr Millington-Drake. In our short history, my small country has survived many threats. We grow fat on threats. Each time we have been threatened, my whole country has taken a step forward. We are very simple. We are only two million people. We only understand a few things. Law, we understand. Justice, we understand. Threats... We will never understand. See me? I'm not big. But I have two million heads. One, two, three, four. And one, two, three, four. Testing. Eeny, meeny, miney, mo. Are you receiving me? Hello, New York. This is Mike Fowler, calling you from the waterfront at Mon... Hey, Pop! Wake up, you crazy mixed-up gaucho. Are they getting us? I have to say no. Oy, hombre, que hacen ustedes aqui? - Un americano. - Americano? Fuera! Con todos! Fuera! Manolo say we must clear out from Manolo's. Tell him I'm reporting on the Graf Spee to the whole of the United States. Tell him this is the best view in Uruguay. Tell him we've got a post office permit. Go on. Tell him. Hello, New York. Hello, New York. This is Mike... - Ahora mismo. - Y mi permiso de partir? Manolo, he say we have no permit from him. Tell him he'll be famous. His... His joint'll be famous. Tell him all the Americans will come here to photograph the Graf Spee. Hello New York, this is Mike Fowler calling you from Montevideo. Manolo, he say the British will sink the Graf Spee before the American tourists get here, and he can make money now. Four people can take drinks at this table, maybe six. Tell him he can bring me six Scotches every half-hour as long as I'm here. Show him the dough. Hello, New York. This is Mike Fowler calling you from Montevideo. Are you receiving me? Over. - Hello, New York. Hello, New York... - Senor Mike. Six double whiskies every quarter of an hour. OK, and he provides the bottles free to pour the drink back. I can't drink on the job and I'm not gonna waste good Scotch. It's a deal. Eh! Tu! Ven. Ven. He's not knocking himself out any, is he? Hello, New York. Hello... Hey, Pop, wake up! We're making history. Inglaterra para siempre! Inglaterra para siempre! Good heavens! A demonstration. Ha. - Anti-British? - Nothing of the sort. They're people of British descent who've come to offer their services. That's a job for Intelligence. Where's er... Ray Martin? Mr Martin is down at the docks. The naval attache from Buenos Aires is there with him. I believe they've installed themselves in a ship's chandler's with a trap door and a telescope. And a cloak and a dagger, I suppose? Well, you leave me out of this. I've got a call in for them. Captain McCall. Oh, hello, Minister. Yes. Yes, Ray Martin's here. He says the street outside the Embassy's crawling with volunteers. Take their names. We'll sort 'em out later. We're organising a 24-hour watch on the Graf Spee, sir. We'll screen them later. We'll certainly need volunteers. Goodbye, Minister. Is this how you live at home? Hey, look out. Pretty chatty ship you've come from. Curse this fishing boat. It moved right in my line of sight. Hello. Some VIP in a launch. It's my old friend Langmann, the German Minister. Paying an official call on Langsdorff. That Langsdorff seems a high-class person. Yes, he is. I'm looking at him. What? Here. Let's have a look. He's shaved his beard off. Hello. - What...? - What is it? British seamen. A whole line of British seamen drawn up on the quarterdeck. There must have been British prisoners on board the Graf Spee during the battle. - That's the custom house. - Carry on please. Hooray! Auf Wiedersehen! Captain Dove, the captain wishes to see you, please. Herr Kapitn. Herr Kapitn? Kapitn Dove ist hier. - Er soll reinkommen. - Danke, Kapitn. Come in, please, Captain. Well, Captain Dove? Well, Captain Langsdorff? I'm glad you're all right. I'd like to say thanks for everything. You've done the best for us and I can only wish you the best for yourself. Thank you. Give my wishes to the others. - Wish them a happy Christmas. - I will. These are... ...from the caps of two of my men that fell in battle. Souvenir. Oh, thanks very much. Is there anything else I can do? If you wouldn't mind telling me, sir, what happened? Yes. We er... Sighted two destroyers and another ship. It wasn't till we closed with them that I realised they were cruisers. By that time, we'd already joined them in battle. I couldn't take my eyes off them. They came at me like destroyers. They kept coming at me. I couldn't believe that they'd dare do this unless they were supported by bigger ships. I thought they were trying to drive me out into the guns of bigger ships. Would you mind telling me their names, sir? Yes. The Ajax, the Achilles and the Exeter. - It couln't be Woodic. It couln't be - I tell you it is. GCT reports a three-funnel cruiser, sir. It is the Cumberland. - It's a miracle. - Miracle or not, sir, we can do with her. How the blazes did she manage to steam 1,000 miles in 35 hours? Chief Yeoman. Mind yourself, son. Flag deck. Make to Cumberland. "How did you get here so quickly?" Cumberland answering, sir. - Apple. - A. - Nuts. - N. - Tommy. - ANT...? - Isaac. - ANTI...? Charlie. Anticipation! Hooray! Qu'est-ce que vous pensez de a? Nous 'avons bas. De quoi discuter. Pourrait-on diner demain? Vous tes libre? Je serais enchant de vous voir, toujours, vous et la chre Lady Effie. Captain Langsdorff. Heil Hitler! Let's forget formalities, gentlemen. - You are well aware of the facts. - Let me see if I have got them right. Early yesterday morning, off Punta del Este, a naval battle took place. The German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee was engaged by three British cruisers, the Exeter, the Ajax and the Achilles, in course of this engagement the German battleship gained a victory. The British cruiser Exeter was seen to be shot to pieces, and the other British cruisers fled. The Graf Spee received a few minor hits and then proceeded to... That is not correct. No? No. The Graf Spee suffered serious damage. She is not seaworthy. This is the communique of your government, quoted by your own official agency. Issued today at 1315 Greenwich Mean Time. Your Excellency knows that in wartime official news must take into consideration, the psychology of the people, the maintenance of morale. Captain Langsdorff, how would you assess the damage to your ship? My galleys have been destroyed. I cannot feed my men. As for the other damage, you sent a technical commission on board. I gave them every help. I have their report. How much time would you say was necessary to make you seaworthy? In my assessment, two to three weeks. At least two weeks. My commission suggests 48 hours. What?! But there are 64 hits on the superstructure alone. In view of this, my government has decided to grant an extension of 72 hours in order to render your ship, the Admiral Graf Spee, seaworthy. The time limit being 8 pm on Sunday 17th December but prohibiting in accordance with the articels of the 13th Hague Convention, any repairs with the purpose of increasing the fighting strength of the vessel. I most strongly protest. I note your protest. Captain McCall, sir. - Carry on, sir? - Yes, please. Let go forward. Let go aft. Bear off. - Hello, sir. - Hello, McCall. Very glad to see you. - You know Woodhouse. - Hello, Woodhouse. - Medley, my staff officer. - Hello, Medley. - Hello. Good morning, gentlemen. - Harwood, I... - Come on. Come on over here. Now, McCall, you've got to stop her sailing. Stop her? But we've been moving heaven and earth to get the Uruguayans to throw her out. - We've persuaded them. - Well, now you can un-persuade them. You've got to keep her here. But how can I now, sir? That's up to you and Martin. Use every possible means. Invoke the 24-hour rule. Anything. Look... My three ships aren't enough to make the issue certain. You know how long it took us to corner her, and the mouth of this river is 100 miles wide. Well, if she gets away again... And she might, she might! I was very lucky on the 13th. I'm not sure I'll be so lucky a second time. I see. The Admiralty have ordered a concentration on Montevideo, all hunting groups. Here, Medley. But just you look at the chart. - Force K. - Renown and Ark Royal. 600 miles east of Pernambuco. - 2,500 miles away. - They'll have to refuel at Rio. Sunday, Monday,... - ...Tuesday, hm? - Mm. Tuesday is the earliest they can be here. Neptune and the French Force X are even farther. Dorsetshire left Cape Town Wednesday. 4,000 miles to steam. You see? You've got to keep her here till Tuesday at least. - Well, we'd better get moving. - That's the spirit. Warn the boat's crew and get my golf clubs. Poor old Millington-Drake! His face when I put him into reverse! - How's he doing? - A wonderful job. Taken them all in his stride, the Ministry of Marine, Defence, the Foreign Office. He's at 'em, day and night, waving the Hague Convention. By George, yes. Luisi, Campos, Guani. Why, I was playing golf with Campos and Luisi only a few days ago. And talking of golf, look at my clubs. Are those clubs? Toothpicks. That's all they are now. One shell took all their heads off. Good shooting, eh? On a fairground, it would have won a teddy bear. Well, don't let the captain of the port arrest you for smuggling. Tell him I'll bring him some gin in a few weeks' time. You know, sir, that the South American states claim all the River Plate as territorial waters? All of it, between Punta Medanos and Punta del Este. Yes, I do. Suppose the Graf Spee does make a break for Buenos Aires. Will you try stop her? McCall, I was never much good on a horse, but I know the drill. Don't take your fences until you have to. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. Good luck. Excuse me, sir. This has just come through for the commodore. Thank you. Medley, make a signal to Admiralty from Commodore, South Atlantic. - Make your pardon, sir, that signal is incorrect. - I haven't said anything yet. You have, sir. I said, "Make a signal to Admiralty." What's wrong with that? You went on to say, "From Commodore, South Atlantic." Well, I... I am Commodore Harwood, aren't I? No, sir. You are Rear Admiral Sir Henry Harwood, Knight Commander of the Bath. My congratulations, sir. Sir. Oh, I say. What's the matter? Bad news? I've been made a Companion of the Bath. So have Parry and Bell. Look at us! One Commander, one Companion of the Bath, and not a blinking bathtub between us! I shall never be any good after this as an ordinary naval attache. Who cares? You realise you're asking me, for your own evil ends, to violate one of... Good morning, Your Excellency. Here he is, Mr Millington-Drake. Thank you, Miss Shaw. Will you leave us, please? His Excellency the British Ambassador in Buenos Aires. Take care off the enemys's ears. Well... Here goes my professional reputation. What is going on at that end? Is that you Millington-Drake? - McCall here, sir. - Ah, You McCall. Yes? - An emergency has arisen over the Graf Spee. - Careful McCall. Security. I know, sir, but this is most urgent. - I have just heard by Admiralty code. - We're not on a scrambler, you know... - That two of our capital ships... - Are you mad? I'm going to hang up. Sir, I must insist. In this case, urgency overrides security. Urgency overrides security?! We, we. Go on. Go on. Both these capital ships will be calling in the next few hours at Bahia... - I've told you before! This is not... - ...at Bahia Blanca to refuel. McCall! They be down to the last drop when they arrive. Stop it! Stop it! They've steamed at full speed for the Plate, for obvious reasons. The fellow's raving mad. They request that we arrange for 2,000 tons of fuel... Really McCall! - You must... - ...of fuel oil to be available in tankers as from tonight. Very well. Very well, McCall. Yes, we got your message. The afternoon papers will be out soon. Knowing how leaky the telephone cables are between here and Buenos Aires, I'shall expect to see the headlines screaming that half the British fleet are off Punta del Este. Excuse me, senorita. Could you translate this for me? The lighthouse keeper at Punta del Este reports that the battleship Barham - and other powerful units of the British fleet have joined Admiral Harwood's squadron. - Thank you. That lighthouse keeper must have very good eyesight. The Barham's in dry dock at Gibraltar. - Mr Millington-Drake. - Sir? Why are your agents now trying to delay the sailing of the Graf Spee? Explain this change of attitude. Your Excellency, it's not a change of attitude. No? No. It's a change of strategy. Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday morning, 10:15, 17th December, the day upon which the time limit set for the Graf Spee will expire. To be precise, at 8 pm local time, she must sail or the Uruguayan Government will intern her. Now, the situation is far from clear, for we're witnessing the departure of a French merchant vessel, the Cote d'Azur. According to the neutrality law a merchant ship must be given 24 hours' notice or 24 hours' grace before an enemy warship can sail after her. So, it seems that if the Graf Spee sails or doesn't sail, she's breaking the law. It's rumoured that outside the mouth of the Rio de la Plata there are five or possibly seven British warships waiting for her. Another rumour says the Germans are bringing up reinforcements, so a naval battle even greater than Wednesday's is imminent. We all figured the Graf Spee would make a run for it under cover of darkness but she's still here. Her Captain Hans Langsdorff has worked all night with the local Nazi Diplomatic Authorities towards one of Germany's most important decisions since the war began. Will they take this vessel out of the haven of the River Plate? If not, she'll be interned, my boy. Will they make a dash for Buenos Aires? Will it be a fight to the death? To get shot up wouldn't be very good propaganda. I wonder how Goebbels would explain that. Nobody knows, an hour ago Captain Langsdorff returned to his ship. He had spent nearly three hours ashore. The German Minister Dr Langmann accompanied him to the quay and as they shook hands was heard to say "until tomorrow." He said it in German I'm giving you a translation. Mr Beasley of the Trevanion. And Captain Dove of the Africa Shell. I've seen you before. Oh? When? In the Graf Spee. With this. Lined up on deck when Langmann came on board for the funeral. - That's right. - I see you all went to it. - Yes, we all went. - We wanted to. I can understand that. In a way, you were shipmates. - It must have been a terrifying experience. - My monkey certainly thought so. - You're well out of it. - Yes. I shouldn't like to have known you were on board when she sails. Do you think she'll try to break out, sir? Well, you know her captain better than we do. He'll fight. He's a good seaman. Flash! This is Mike Fowler, reporting to you from Montevideo. The latest rumour is that the Graf Spee may be granted an extension of time. It's a bright sunny day here in Montevideo. Very sunny indeed. The visibility's about 20 miles but the British warships are out of sight. It is now absolutely definite that no less than 13 Allied warships including the battleship Renown and the carrier Ark Royal are waiting outside. The same question is on everybody's lips. Will the Graf Spee dare to come out? Come here. Buzz off, Swanston. From our ambassador in Buenos Aires. Strong rumour current here that the Graf Spee will sail tonight. So, she is coming out. Is she? What would you do if you had the Graf Spee under your command? Well, I'd come out as soon as it was dark, try and dodge the ships waiting for me outside and get to the open sea again. If I failed to dodge them, I'd fight to a finish. Isn't that what you'd do, sir? Sounds simple. I wonder if it sounds that simple to Langsdorff. - Why not? - He's got plenty of headaches. Headache number one, he doesn't know what force we've got out here. Headache number two, he can let himself be interned in Montevideo, but Uruguay might come into the war later on, on our side, and then the Graf Spee would fall into our hands. He might make a dash for Buenos Aires, but the channel's narrow. - And shallow. - And muddy. If he fouls up his water intake, he'll be a sitting duck. Yes. He'll come out. When do you think he'll move? Now. In the next 15 minutes. That's when I'd weigh anchor. Let's go and see. Captains of warships, my dear Woodie, are not only naval officers. What we do or don't do is being constantly interpreted one way or another by friends and enemies... or neutrals. If we sink her, it can only be interpreted one way. I'm not so sure. Think a bit, Heart Of Oak. If we open fire within the River Plate, we'll be accused of violating neutral territory. Think what little Goebbels will make of it. Well, it's up to you, sir. Yes. Thank you very much. Hello. Hello. This is Mike Fowler reporting once again from my ringside seat at Montevideo. I had to go off the air just now because the crowd was so immense, they broke my microphone cable. Thanks to the gallant police of Uruguay order has been restored, and the line has been repaired. There's two for you. Lays it on thick, doesn't he? As you know the time limit set for the Graf Spee was 8 pm local time this evening. It is now 7:50. Ten minutes to go. It's hard to describe the scene here as tension mounts by the minute. All right, Woodie. Here we go. Make to Achilles and Cumberland, - "Form a single line ahead." - Yes, sir. Flag deck. Break on hoist order one. And it's an outsize in bowler hats if this goes wrong. The sun is sinking. The evening is fine and clear. Everybody who can walk ride or crawl has come down to the waterfront to get a ringside view of this first real climax of the war. The crowd here on the beaches and rooftops would put football crowds to shame. All afternoon, we watch men have been transferred to the SS Tacoma, the German merchantman which has moved up close to the Graf Spee. There can only be a suicide crew left on board this monster lying here before us in the harbour, this sinister powerful menacing monster. This afternoon, we heard the Graf Spee's engines. Now her diesels have started up again. There's black smoke coming out of her fun... Excuse me, I let get it drink a water. My throat's getting dry with excitement. Mine too. Pop, give me a drink. Excuse me, while I gulp some water. My throat's getting dry with excitement. - Hombre, la ltima botella, huh? - What, you too? The vast crowd, which has been so noisy, seem to have lost their voices as well. Everybody is watching in silence. Now. Now. Yes. Yes! Ladies and gentlemen, the pocket battleship Graf Spee is finally moving. Yes, she's moving out of the harbour, moving out of the harbour now under her own power. Go on to 18 knots. 140 revolutions. Steer 270. Due west. Port 10. The SS Tacoma's following her. Oh, brother! Anything could happen now. Catapult aircraft. Catapult platform, catapult aircraft. We're standing spellbound here in Montevideo as the great pocket battleship leaves the harbour. Some people are waving. I can see some women on their knees praying. Nobody knows what Captain Langsdorff intends to do. Nobody knows what Herr Hitler has told him to do. Whether he prefers the pride of the German Navy to be interned or whether he wants her to fight a short and spectacular vicious action, nobody knows. But we're all aware that the German propaganda machine cannot possibly afford to lose a battle with the whole of the world looking on and taking sides. Ajax aircraft reporting. I think she's left the deep channel for Buenos Aires. The Graf Spee is now about three miles out. She seems to have changed course. Yes, yes. She's changing course toward the British ships. Now she's slowing down. It looks like she's going to stop. She's stopped now. Yes. Definitely. She has stopped. The mighty battleship has come to a halt. We're all in suspense. The sun is just touching the horizon, and through my glasses I can see quite clearly that a big launch has left the battleship and is proceeding to the Tacoma. I can see that the launch is full of men. I can assure you that although we're able to follow every move, it's impossible to imagine what will happen next. The suspense here is unbelievable. The best guess is that they've left a suicide crew on board to put up as good a fight as possible against hopeless odds and go down fighting the British ships... - An enormous sheet of flames! A tremendous. - What happened? We can feel the blast here, three miles away. It's suicide. She's tearing herself apart. Another explosion. And another! The smoke's just pouring out of her. Red and yellow flames. Listen. You can hear the thunder of the explosions from here. It's fantastic! A gigantic witch's caulron of fire. It's like a Viking's funeral barbaric savage overwheiming. It's a staggering thundering petrifying spectacle. We're witnessing the dying convuisions of a hunted beast. We're all cowering under the irresistible force of the explosions of ammunition, tons of fuel, shells warheads and torpedoes, which are tearing her great body into bits tossing tons of steel into the air until the blazing hull is like a steel volcano. Timed to the second. Exactly at sunset. The twilight of the gods. Well, that's that, Woodie. Yes, sir. Make to Achilles and Cumberland. "Many a life... ...has been saved today." Recover aircraft. Stand to attention. Face to starboard. They're cheering us, sir. - Hooray! - Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Aircraft secured, sir. - Chief Yeoman. - Sir? - Make to Achilles and Cumberland, "Follow Father." - Aye-aye, sir. - Pilot. - Sir? - You see that bonfire over there? - Yes, sir. Well, steer straight for it. Kapitn "Tacoma", this is the gunboat Uruguay. Hier! You left harbour without clearance papers and without a pilot. You are under arrest. Send over your launch. I protest. By international law... You have been openly assisting a belligerent warship in Uruguayan territorial waters. This is a merchant vessel. It is not on my country's war reserve. Is Kapitn Langsdorff on board? Yes. I am coming on board you. Leutnant Schneider. - Schneider! - Jawohl, Herr Kapitn? Die Leute sind alle runter. Jawohl, Herr Kapitn. Die sind fnfzig. Sagen Sie ihnen, sie sollen es schneller machen. Es wird bald ganz dunkel sein. Jawohl, Herr Kapitn. Los! Beeilen Sie sich doch da unten bevor es ganz dunkel wird! Kapitn. I have orders not to detain you, Kapitn Langsdorff nor any of your men. Captain Langsdorff. Well, Captain Dove. They let me come out to see you. I was glad to come. Things have changed a bit for you since we said goodbye four days ago. Yes. I had sort of unofficial orders to come and see you because... ...there's a rumour in Montevideo that you perished with your ship. The safety of my crew comes first. I want you to know, Captain, that everyone on shore who's come in contact with you... ...respects you very much. And I can only say, as a private person, even your enemies. I'm sorry to see you in this situation... ...and alone. Every commander is alone, Captain. Goodbye. Thank you. This is Mike Fowler reporting to you once again and finally from Montevideo. In these late hours of Sunday 17th December 1939, there are still thousands of people milling around here in front of me. They just don't want to go home. They can't believe it's all over. It's like a thriller that you can't put down till you get to the last page. The tiger of the seas has been hunted down. There she lies burning from stem to stern, while the hunters those who tracked her down fought her, pursued her, and drove her to a violent and tragic death. The hunters are back on their watch. And this is yours truly, Mike Fowler, signing off and saying good night to you from Montevideo.
