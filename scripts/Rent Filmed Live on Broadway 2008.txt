It's the top floor of what was once a music-publishing factory. Old rock 'n' roll posters hang on the walls. They have Roger's picture advertising gigs... ...at CBGB's and the Pyramid Club. We have an illegal wood-burning stove. Its exhaust pipe crawls up to a skylight. All of our electrical appliances are plugged... ...into one thick extension cord which snakes its way out a window. Outside, a small tent city has sprung up in the lot next to our building. Inside, it's freezing because we have no heat. Smile! December 24th, 9 p. m. Eastern Standard Time From here on in, I shoot without a script See if anything comes of it Instead of my old shit First shot Roger Tuning the Fender guitar He hasn't played in a year - This won't tune - So we hear He's just coming back From half a year of withdrawal - You talking to me? - Not at all Are you ready? Hold that focus steady Tell the folks at home What you're doing, Roger I'm writing one great- - The phone rings - Saved Re-screen Zoom in on the answering machine - Speak. - Speak. That was a very loud beep I don't even know if this is working Mark? Mark? Are you there? Are you screening your calls? It's Mom We wanted to call And say we love you And we'll miss you tomorrow Cindy and the kids are here Send their love Oh, I hope you like the hot plate Just don't leave it on, dear When you leave the house Oh, and Mark We're sorry to hear That Maureen dumped you I say c'est la vie So let her be a lesbian There are other fishies in the sea Love, Mom Tell the folks at home What you're doing, Roger - I'm writing one great song - The phone rings We screen - Speak. - Speak. - Chestnuts roasting - Collins - I'm downstairs - Hey Roger picked up the phone? - No, it's me - Throw down the key A wild night is now preordained I may be detained What does he mean? What do you mean, detained? - Benny. Shit. - Shit. - Dudes, I'm on my way - Great, fuck - I need the rent - What rent? - This past year's rent, which I let slide. - Let slide? You said we were golden. - When you bought the building - When we were roommates - Remember, you lived here? - How could I forget? You, me, Collins and Maureen. How is the drama queen? She's performing tonight. I know. Still a production manager? Two days ago, I was bumped. - You still dating her? - Last month, I was dumped - She's in love - Oh, she's got a new man? - Well, no- - What's his name? - Joanne. - Joanne. Rent, my amigos, is due, or I will have to evict you. Be there in a few. The power blows. How do you document real life When real life's getting more Like fiction each day? Headlines, bread lines Blow my mind And now this deadline Eviction or pay Rent How do you write a song When the chords sound wrong? Though they once sounded Right and rare When the notes are sour Where is the power You once had to ignite the air? - We're hungry and frozen - Some life we've chosen - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay - How we gonna pay - Last year's rent? - Last year's rent? We light candles. How do you start a fire When there's nothing to burn And it feels like something's stuck In your flue? How can you generate heat When you can't feel your feet - And they're turning blue? - And they're turning blue? You light up a mean blaze - With posters - And screenplays - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay - How we gonna pay - Last year's rent? - Last year's rent? Don't screen, Maureen, it's me. Joanne, your substitute production manager. Hey, hey, hey. Did you eat? Don't change the subject, Maureen But, darling, You haven't eaten all day You won't throw up You won't throw up The digital delay didn't blow up, exactly. There may have been one teeny, tiny spark. You're not calling Mark. How do you stay on your feet When on every street It's trick or treat And tonight it's trick? Welcome back to town I should lie down Everything's brown And, uh-oh, I feel sick - Where is he? - Getting dizzy - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay? How we gonna pay? How we gonna pay Last year's rent? Allison, baby You sound sad I can't believe those two After everything I've done Ever since our wedding, I'm dirt They'll see I can help them all out In the long run The music ignites the night - With passionate fire - Maureen, I'm not a theater person. The narration crackles and pops With incendiary wit Could never be a theater person. Zoom in as they burn the past To the ground And feel the heat Of the future's glow Hello. Maureen. Your equipment won't work? Okay, all right, I'll go. How do you leave the past behind When it keeps finding ways To get to your heart? It reaches way down deep And tears you inside out Till you're torn apart Rent How can you connect in an age Where strangers, landlords, lovers Your own blood cells betray? What binds the fabric together When the raging, shifting winds Of change keep ripping away? Draw a line in the sand And then make a stand - Use your camera to spar - Use your guitar When they act tough You call their bluff We're not gonna pay We're not gonna pay We're not gonna pay Last year's rent This year's rent Next year's rent Rent, rent, rent, rent, rent We're not gonna pay rent 'Cause everything is rent Christmas bells are ringing Christmas bells are ringing Christmas bells are ringing Somewhere else, not here You okay, honey? I'm afraid so They get any money? No, had none to get But they purloined my coat Well, you missed a sleeve - Thanks - Hell, it's Christmas Eve I'm Angel Angel Indeed. An angel of the first degree Friends call me Collins. Tom Collins. Nice tree Let's get a Band-Aid for your knee I'll change it There's a Life Support meeting At 9:30 Yes, this body Provides a comfortable home For the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome - As does mine - Oh, well, you look fine Get you a coat Have a bite and make a night - I'm flush - My friends are waiting You're cute when you blush The more, the merry Ho, ho, ho And I do not take no - Where are you going? - Maureen calls. You're such a sucker. I don't suppose you'd like to see her show in the lot tonight... ...or come to dinner? Zoom in on my empty wallet. Touch. Take your AZT. Close on Roger His girlfriend April left a note Saying, "We've got AIDS" Before slitting her wrists In the bathroom I'll check up on you later. If you change your mind... You have to get out of the house. I'm writing one great song Before I... God. One song Glory One song before I go Glory One song to leave behind Find one song One last refrain Glory From the pretty-boy front man Who wasted opportunity One song He had the world at his feet Glory In the eyes of a young girl A young girl Find glory Beyond the cheap colored lights One song Before the sun sets Glory On another empty life Time flies Time dies Glory One blaze of glory One blaze of glory Glory Find glory In a song that rings true Truth like a blazing fire An eternal flame Find one song A song about love Glory From the soul of a young man A young man Find the one song Before the virus takes hold Glory Like a sunset One song To redeem this empty life Time flies And then no need To endure anymore Time dies The door. - What'd you forget? - Got a light? I know you, you're- You're shivering It's nothing They turned off my heat And I'm just a little weak on my feet Would you light my candle? - What are you staring at? - Nothing Your hair in the moonlight You look familiar - Can you make it? - Just haven't eaten much today At least the room Stopped spinning anyway - What? - Nothing - Your smile reminded me of- - I always "remind people of" - Who is she? - She died - Her name was April - It's out again Sorry 'bout your friend Would you light my candle? - Well? - Yeah? Oh, the wax - It's- - Dripping - I like it between my- - Fingers I figured Oh, well, good night - It blew out again? - No, I think that I dropped my stash I know I've seen you out and about When I used to go out Your candle's out I'm illin' I had it when I walked in the door It was pure Is it on the floor? The floor? They say that I have the best ass Below 14th Street - Is it true? - What? - You're staring again - Oh, no I mean, you do have a nice- I mean, you look familiar - Like your dead girlfriend - Only when you smile But I'm sure I've seen you Somewhere else Do you go to the Cat Scratch Club? That's where I work I dance Help me look Yes They used to tie you up It's a living I didn't recognize you Without the handcuffs We could light the candle Oh, won't you light the candle? Why don't you forget that stuff? - You look like you're 16 - I'm 19 But I'm old for my age I'm just born to be bad I once was born to be bad I used to shiver like that - I have no heat, I told you - I used to sweat - I got a cold - Uh-huh, I used to be a junkie - But now and then I like to feel good - Uh-huh - Oh, here - What's that? Candy-bar wrapper.

With you? - No, with my father - I'm Roger They call me They call me Mimi Hi, you've reached Maureen and Joanne. Leave a message. Don't forget "Over the Moon," my performance... ...protesting the eviction of the homeless and artists... ...from the 11th Street lot tonight at midnight, between A and B. Party at Life Cafe to follow. Well, Joanne, we're off I tried you at the office And they said you were Stage managing or something Remind her that those unwed mothers in Harlem need her help too. Call Daisy for our itinerary Or Alfred at Pound Ridge Or Eileen at the State Department In a pinch We'll be at the spa for New Year's Unless the senator changes his mind - The hearings - Oh, yes, kitten Mommy's confirmation hearings Begin on the 10th We'll need you alone By the 6th - Harold! - You hear that?

Well, tonight's the night. Come to the Life Cafe after Maureen's show. No flow. Gentlemen, our benefactor On this Christmas Eve Whose charity is only matched By talent, I believe A new member of the Alphabet City Avant-garde Angel Dumott Schunard Today for you Tomorrow for me Today for you Tomorrow for me - And you should hear her beat - You earned this on the street? It was my lucky day today On Avenue A When a lady in a limousine Drove my way She said, "Darling, be a dear Haven't slept in a year I need your help to make my Neighbor's yappy dog disappear This Akita, Evita, just won't shut up I believe if you play nonstop That pup will breathe its very last High-strung breath I'm certain that cur Will bark itself to death" Today for you Tomorrow for me Today for you Tomorrow for me We agreed on a fee $1000 guarantee, tax free And a bonus if I trim her tree Now, who could foretell That it would go so well? But sure as I am here That dog is now in doggy hell After an hour, Evita, in all her glory From a window ledge Of that 23rd story Like Thelma and Louise did When they got the blues Swan-dove into the courtyard Of the Gracie Mews Today for you Tomorrow for me Today for you Tomorrow for me You go, girl. Back on the street Where I met my sweet Where he was moaning and groaning On the cold concrete The nurse took him home For some Mercurochrome Then I dressed his wounds And got him back on his feet Sing it Today for you Tomorrow for me Today for you Tomorrow for me I said Today for you Tomorrow for me Today for you Tomorrow For me Joy to the world Hey. You bum. Yeah, you. Move over. Get your ass off that Range Rover. That attitude toward the homeless... ...is exactly what Maureen is protesting tonight. Close-up: Our ex-roommate, Benjamin Coffin III... ...who married Allison Grey of the Westport Greys... ...then bought our building and the lot next door... ...from his father-in-law, in hopes of starting a cyber-studio. Maureen is protesting Losing her performance space Not my attitude What happened to Benny? What happened to his heart And the ideals he once pursued? Any owner of that lot next door Has the right to do with it As he pleases Happy birthday, Jesus - The rent - You're wasting your time - We're broke - You broke your word, this is absurd There is one way You won't have to pay I knew it. Next door, the home of CyberArts And now that the block is rezoned Our dream can become a reality You'll see, boys You'll see, boys A state-of-the-art, digital Virtual interactive studio I'll forgo your rent And on paper guarantee That you can stay here for free - If you do me one small favor. - What? Convince Maureen to cancel her protest. Why not just get an injunction or call the cops? I did, and they're on standby. But my investors would rather I handle this quietly You can't wipe out an entire tent city... ...then watch It's a Wonderful Life on TV. You wanna produce films and write songs? You need somewhere to do it It's what we used to dream about Think twice before you pooh-pooh it You'll see, boys You'll see, boys You'll see the beauty of a studio That lets us do our work And get paid With condos on the top Whose rent keeps open our shop Just stop the protest And you'll have it made You'll see Or you'll pack. That boy could use some Prozac. - Or heavy drugs. - Or group hugs. Which reminds me, we have a detour to make tonight. Anyone who wants to can come along. Life Support's a group for people coping with life. We don't have to stay too long. First I've got a protest to save - Pleasure. - I'm not much company. - Behave. - He'll catch up later. He's just got other things on his mind. We'll see, boys We'll see, boys Let it be, boys - I like boys - Boys like me We'll see And so, into the abyss The lot, where a small stage is partially set up. Line in. I went to Harvard for this? - Close on Mark's nose dive. - Line out. Will he get out of here alive? - Mark? - Hi. I told her not to call you That's Maureen, but can I help Since I'm here? I've hired an engineer. Great. So nice to have met you. Wait. She's three hours late. The samples won't delay But the cable- There's another way Say something, anything Test, one, two, three Anything but that - This is weird - It's weird - Very weird - Fuckin' weird I'm so mad that I don't know what to do Fighting with microphones Freezing down to my bones And to top it all off I'm with you Feel like going insane? Got a fire in your brain? And you're thinking Of drinking gasoline? - As a matter of fact - Honey, I know this act It's called the Tango: Maureen The Tango: Maureen It's a dark, dizzy merry-go-round - As she keeps you dangling - You're wrong - Your heart she is mangling - It's different with me And you toss and you turn 'Cause her cold eyes can burn Yet you yearn, and you churn And rebound I think I know what you mean - The Tango: Maureen - The Tango: Maureen Has she ever pouted her lips And called you "pookie"? Never. Have you ever Doubted a kiss or two? This is spooky Did you swoon When she walked through the door? Every time, so be cautious Did she moon over other boys? - More than moon - I'm getting nauseous Where'd you learn how to tango? With the French ambassador's daughter in her room at Miss Porter's. And you? With Nanette Himmelfarb, the rabbi's daughter... ...at the Scarsdale Jewish Community Center. It's hard to do this backwards. You should try it in heels. - She cheated - She cheated - Maureen cheated - Fuckin' cheated I'm defeated I should give up right now Gotta look on the bright side With all of your might I'd fall for her still, anyhow When you're dancing her dance You don't stand a chance Her grip of romance makes you fall - So you think, "Might as well" - "Dance a tango to hell" "At least I'll have tangoed at all" The Tango: Maureen Gotta dance till your diva is through You pretend to believe her 'Cause in the end You can't leave her But the end, it will come Still you have to play dumb Till you're glum and you bum And turn blue Why do we love when she's mean? And she can be so obscene Try the mike. My Maureen - Patched. - Thanks. You know, I feel great now. I feel lousy. Hey, honey. We're- "Pookie"? You never called me "Pookie. " Forget it. We're patched. The Tango: Maureen Steve. Gordon. Ali. - Pam. - Lisa. Hi. I'm Angel. Tom. Collins. I'm Paul. Let's begin. There's only us There's only this Sorry. Excuse me. And you are...?

All right, but, Gordon How do you feel today? - What do you mean? - How do you feel today? - Okay. - Is that all? - Best I've felt all year - Then why choose fear? I'm a New Yorker Fear's my life Look, I find Some of what you teach suspect Because I'm used to Relying on intellect But I try to open up To what I don't know Because reason says I should have died Three years ago No other road No other way No day but today What's the time? Well, it's gotta be close to midnight My body's talking to me It says, "Time for danger" It says, "I wanna commit a crime Wanna be the cause of a fight I wanna put on a tight skirt And flirt with a stranger" I've had a knack from way back At breaking the rules Once I learn the game Get up, life's too quick I know someplace sick Where this chick'll Dance in the flames We don't need any money I always get in for free You can get in too If you get in with me Let's go Out tonight I have to go Out tonight You wanna play?

Come back another day Another day The heart may freeze Or it can burn The pain will ease If I can learn There is no future There is no past I live this moment as My last There's only us There's only this Forget regret Or life is yours to miss No other road No other way No day but today Excuse me if I'm off track But if you're so wise Then tell me Why do you need smack? Take your needle Take your fancy prayer Don't forget Get the moonlight out of your hair Long ago you might have Lit up my heart But the fire's dead Ain't never ever gonna start Another time Another place The words would only rhyme We'd be in outer space It'd be another song We'd sing another way You wanna prove me wrong?

Which way to the stage? Snow Maureen's performance. Last night I had a dream. I found myself in a desert called Cyberland. It was hot. My canteen had sprung a leak, and I was... ...thirsty. Out of the abyss walked a cow. Elsie. I asked if she had anything to drink. She said: "I'm forbidden to produce milk In Cyberland we only drink Diet Coke" Yes. She said: "Only thing to do Is jump over the moon They've closed everything real down Like barns and troughs And performance spaces And replaced it all with lies And rules and virtual life" But there is a way out. Leap of faith, leap of faith Leap of faith, leap of faith Only thing to do Is jump over the moon I gotta get out of here It's like I'm being tied to the hood Of a yellow rental truck Packed in With fertilizer and fuel oil Pushed over a cliff By a suicidal Mickey Mouse I've Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta Gotta, gotta find a way To jump over the moon Only thing to do Is jump over the moon Then a little bulldog entered.

Angel was one of my closest friends. It's right that it's Halloween because it was her favorite holiday. I knew we'd hit it off the moment we met. That skinhead was bothering her... ...and she said she was more of a man than he'd ever be... ...and more of a woman than he'd ever get. And then there was a time... ...he walked up to this group of tourists... ...and they were petrified... ...because, A, they were obviously lost... ...and, B, had probably never spoken to a drag queen before in their lives. And he... She... ...just offered to escort them out of Alphabet City... ...and then she let them take a picture with her... ...and then she said she'd help them find the Circle Line. So much more original than any of us. You'd find an old tablecloth on the street and make a dress... ...and next year, sure enough... ...they'd be mass-producing them at the Gap. You always said how lucky you were that we were all friends... ...but it was us, baby... ...who were the lucky ones.

How the hell? Pan left Close on the steeple of the church How did I get here? How the hell? Christmas Christmas Eve last year How could a night so frozen Be so scalding hot? How can a morning this mild Be so raw? Why are entire years strewn On the cutting-room floor of memory When single frames From one magic night Forever flicker in close-up On the 3-D Imax of my mind? That's poetic That's pathetic Why did Mimi knock on Roger's door And Collins choose that phone booth Back where Angel set up his drums? Why did Maureen's equipment Break down? Why am I the witness? And when I capture it on film Will it mean that it's the end And I'm alone? It's true you sold your guitar And bought a car?

You know I tried. Fade in on Mark Who's still in the dark - But he's got great footage - Which he's cut together To screen tonight. - In honor of Benny's wife - Muffy Allison Pulling Benny Out of the East Village location Then again, maybe we won't screen it tonight. I wonder how Allison found out about Mimi? Maybe a little bird told her. Or an angel. I had a little hunch That you could use a little flow - Tutoring again? - Negative - Back at NYU? - No, no, no I rewired the ATM At The Food Emporium To provide an honorarium To anyone with the code The code - Well? - Well? A- N-G-E-L. Yet Robin Hooding Isn't the solution The powers that be Must be undermined where they dwell In a small, exclusive Gourmet institution Where we overcharge The wealthy clientele Let's open up a restaurant In Santa Fe With a private corner banquette In the back We'll make it yet We'll somehow get to Santa Fe But you'd miss New York Before you could unpack Mark! Roger! Anyone, help! - Maureen? - It's Mimi! We can't get her up the stairs! No! She was huddled in the park In the dark And she was freezing And begged to come here - Over here? Oh, God. - Yeah. Got a light? I know you You're shivering - She's been living on the street - We need some heat - I'm shivering. - Okay. We can buy some wood And something to eat I'm afraid she needs more than heat I heard that Collins will call for a doctor, honey Don't waste your money on me Hello, 911? I'm on hold. Cold, cold Would you light my candle? Yes- Oh, God Find a candle I should tell you I should tell you I should tell you I should tell you I should tell you Benny wasn't anything- I know I should tell you why I left - It wasn't 'cause I didn't- - I know - I should tell you - I should tell you I should tell you, I love you Who do you think you are? Leaving me alone with my guitar Hold on, there's something You should hear It isn't much, but it took all year Your eyes As we said our goodbyes Can't get them out of my mind And I find I can't hide From your eyes The ones that took me by surprise The night you came into my life Where there's moonlight I see your eyes How'd I let you slip away When I'm longing so to hold you? Now I'd die for one more day 'Cause there's something I should have told you Yes, there's something I should have told you When I looked into your eyes Why does distance make us wise? You were the song all along And before this song dies I should tell you I should tell you I have always loved you You can see it in my eyes Mimi - I jumped over the moon. - What? A leap of: She's back. I was in a tunnel... ...headed for this warm, white light. Oh, my God. And I swear... ...Angel was there. And she looked good. And she said: "Turn around, girlfriend... ...and listen to that boy's song. " She's drenched. Her fever's breaking There is no future There is no past Thank God this moment's Not the last - There's only us - There's only us - There's only this - There's only this - Forget regret - Forget regret Or life is yours to miss No other road No other way No day but today - I can't control - Will I lose my dignity? - My destiny - Will someone care? - I trust my soul - Will I wake tomorrow My only goal - Is just to be - From this nightmare? - Without you - There's only now - The hand gropes - There's only here - The ear hears - Give in to love - The pulse beats - Or live in fear - Life goes on - No other path - But I'm gone - No other way - 'Cause I die without you - No day but today - I die without you - No day but today - I die without you - No day but today - I die without you - No day but today - I die without you - No day but today - I die without you - No day but today No day but today Five hundred twenty-five thousand Six hundred minutes Five hundred twenty-five thousand Moments so dear Five hundred twenty-five thousand Six hundred minutes How do you measure Measure a year?
