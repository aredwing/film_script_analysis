Your mission... complete paper route in 30 minutes. One lone hero stands out among the rest. One fearless rider has the fortitude... to deliver the goods. To stand up to the forces of darkness... the legions of doom, the armies of oppression... and the evil Ice Cream Man. Paperboy. Welcome to the ice age, paperboy! # I scream, you scream # We all scream for ice cream! Oh, nuts! I forgot the sprinkles! Ha ha ha ha ha! Hey, Max. Ohh! A Tony Hawk sundae! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, that Ice Cream Man sure is evil. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! I will defeat you... with my complicated fighting move. We shall see whose kung fu is superior. Hyah! Yah! Paperboy power! Didn't hurt! You can run, but you can't hide, paperboy! # Everywhere # # Gonna do everything # # Gonna do my best to reach your sky # # 'Cause I don't care # Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Paper? What took you so long? I stopped for some ice cream. Get out of bed, jabrodie. Get out of bed, jabrodie. Get out of bed... Ow! Heh. OK, I dreamed it. So maybe my life really isn't like that. And maybe I'm not the coolest kid ever. But today was the first day of junior high... and I was sure that things were gonna be different. Ya-ha-ha! I had a new look. I was a baller, a shot-caller. I was a player with phat attitude. Or, as I like to call it... Phat-itude. Hi, Mom. It's finished. The house is perfect. Just as I'd always pictured it. But let's keep that between you and me. Meet my mom. She's been putting the "finishing touches"... on our house for, like, six years. You could say she's a bit obsessed. This is my house. My kitchen! Mine! Morning. This is my dad. He works in advertising. His boss, Mr. Foge, makes him wear goofy costumes sometimes. Luckily, he's got us for support. What is that? Heh. I'm Lieutenant Lobster. For the Lobster Shack pitch today? Do you really have to wear that? Lily, come on. Foge has got a dozen junior ad execs... lined up who'd be happy to be Lieutenant Lobster. Foged again. DON: But just for this pitch. I better be off. Off to junior high... my little soldier all grown up. -Good luck, honey. -Thanks, Mom. -Don't break anything. -OK, Mom. Hey, Max? You want a ride? Um... that's OK. I'll take the bus. Yeah, the bus. Right. You know that kid everyone thinks is weird... but he doesn't care what everyone thinks? This is him. He's my best friend. His name's Robert, but we call him Robe. Guess why? Hey, you guys! This is my other best friend. Her name's Megan. She never goes anywhere without her clarinet... Even when she takes a trip. You OK? Yeah, I'm tough like a tank. Yeah, the septic tank. Says the freak in the robe that smells like diapers. Max, where's your bassoon? Um... My bassoon... I thought we were taking band together. I've been thinking. It's junior high. Is band still cool? Cool? What are you talking about? Since when have we been cool? All I'm saying is, let's try to act cool. Sweet! A can. Mmm. -Blech! -Eww! # Today # # I changed # # But too late # # 'Cause every town feels the same # # I'm different # #And you're distant # #Add it up and it makes no difference # For the yearbook. How's this? "Sheep arrive for slaughter"? No, no, no! Please! Please! Don't make me go! I don't want to go! Does he know something we don't? JINDRAIKE: Here they come. With their pimples and their braces... and their rickets and their lice. Their snot-nosed, baggy-pantsed... high-pitched, squealing voices. And yet, each one a rung on the ladder of my success. A ladder that ends in a vast neon sign... that stretches across the night sky. MRS. RANGOON: Principal Jindraike? These came from your real-estate agent. The sign, Mrs. Rangoon. What does it say? "Superintendent Jindraike." The sign on my office door. That's what it should say. Sounds so much better than "Superintendent Knebworth." It's classier, too. When Knebworth sees what I've done in his honor... the old dinosaur is sure to make me his successor. But, first things first, Mrs. Rangoon. Set up the video broadcast machine device. I want to address the acne-strafed masses. Curtis Junior High has a long... and fascinating history of colorful bullies. -You're lying. -Am I? In 1985, Tomato-face Callahan. He'd walk right up and shove a tomato in your face. 1991, Wedgie Jackson. He invented the world wide wedge. Which brings us to this year. Troy McGinty. Word is, he's gonna pound... on a different kid every day. And he's devised his own special way... of letting the world know who he's coming after. Max Keeble? Here. All right. Julius Klinghoffer. -Here. -All right. Lil' Romeo? Yo, whuzzup? I'm over here, wo dat. OK. Lil' Romeo's in the house. I'm down with that. Tina Michaels? And now... This is Principal Jindraike. All students will report to the assembly hall... during third period for a special presentation. Attendance is mandatory. All must attend. Not attending is prohibited. That is all. Thank you. Yes! The reviews are in. Ha! Jindraike, two thumbs up. I laughed, I cried. The man's a genius. -Principal Jindraike! -What now, Rangoon? The red light's still on. I'm well aware of that. Didn't even notice! Good morning. I'm Ms. Dingman, and welcome to Life Science. You OK? I can't feel my fingers. ...like this. Pheromones. Nature's dating service. Odorless, colorless. It's how many species attract mates. A chemical process which causes... an irresistible attraction... in the opposite sex. Allow me to demonstrate. Would someone like to open the window for me, please? You in the robe. Aww. Wow, that's cool! You see? Irresistible. ["Baby, One More Time" playing] # Oh, baby, baby # # Eh, eh # Are you OK? Yeah! Yeah. I'm fine. You look kind of familiar. I deliver your paper. I'm Max, Jenna. Oh, yeah. You go to school here now? You play the clarinet. First chair. I'm in band, too. I play the bassoon. Hmm. Well, I'll see you later. I'll see you bassoon. See you bassoon? Ecch! Stupid! Max Keeble. Troy! Troy McGinty, how are you? First victim of the year there, buddy. It's a big honor. Know the guy you hung out with when you were little... but as you got older you went in opposite directions? Troy McGinty wasn't always a bully. I remember when he came to my fourth birthday. The theme was MacGoogles the Frog. # MacGoogles is me name # # I like a swampy bog # # It's time to play a game # # With your favorite Highland frog # I don't like MacGoogles! He's not real, Troy. He's just a TVcharacter. Is there a wee laddie having his birthday today? MacGoogles! He's trying to eat me! Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat. Troy, it's me, Mr. Keeble. MacGoogles ate Max's daddy! Troy had grown a lot since then. Whoa! What are you doing? Where's Max? I don't know. Wasn't it your turn to watch him? McGINTY: Welcome to cooking with Troy. First, you want to dip your little piece of chicken... in a nice, thick batter. No. Troy, no! -Hold it! Stop! -OK, we're set. Yaah! No! Troy! Now you want to roll your piece of dead meat... in some bread crumbs. Perfect. And now that that's done... our bird should be ready to go in. Oh, gross! Ecch! Hope you like lasagna. Settle down. Cease! This Thursday, Superintendent Knebworth... will be here to inspect the school. And so I am upgrading my policy of zero tolerance... to one of sub-zero tolerance. Which is more than zero. Cease! And now, without any further ado... what's that I hear? The pitter-patter of little feet? Allow me to introduce to you the newest addition... to the Curtis Junior High School Cottontails... three foreign exchange students from eastern Europe... and their names are... unimportant, because they're here... to lead us to gridiron glory. Why, all they need is a place to play. Students, I give you your new football stadium. Eww! You, there! Little boy! Prankster! What is your name? Uh, Max Keeble. I've got my eye on you, Max Keeble. You're on my list. -It wasn't my... -Sit! Heh heh heh. MEGAN: This is a bad junior high. I can't believe what McGinty did to you. Mr. Jindraike says if someone tries... to start a fight with you, just ignore them. Ew! Robe! Ew! Max, you can't go through the rest of the day like that. I don't plan on it. Where's he going? How great. # Hey baby, hey baby # # Yeah baby, yeah baby # # Hey baby # Cool. Hey, man, you got any spare air? # Yeah, baby # # Yeah baby # Whoo! He calls his victims "Investors"? He's got all the latest technology... and he's looking to make a killing... in the stock market. M-m-m-marching call! # You know the fella's good for the moola # This guy, Dobbs, was once a stock-market whiz kid. By age 10, he was a millionaire. 12:15. Meeting with Keeble. Keeble. By age 12, he'd lost it all. Now he's obsessed with getting it back... one kid at a time. Keeble! Caught your act in the assembly. Looks like you can use some help... with managing your portfolio. That's my lunch money! And you have it all in cash. Kid, let me hold this for a while... and I'll set you up with a nice mutual fund. What's going on here? He's taking Max's lu... lunch money. Is this true, Mr. Dobbs? No. I'm just spreading some investment wisdom. Speaking of which... how did Biomorph Systems work out for you? Heh heh. Best money I ever spent. By the way, what do you think of Handspring? Handspring? It's moving today. I'd say buy. -Thanks. -No prob. Uh... Don't miss me. Ha! Excuse me! Anybody want my carrots? What? Keeble! You may be under the impression... that I encourage horseplay and malarkey. I don't encourage it. I excourage it. Excourage? It means the opposite of encourage. Look it up. Elliot! And so, young man, remember... "Study" rhymes with "Buddy." Scram. -Hey. -What are you doing here? I thought you said band wasn't cool enough for you. Yeah, but I thought it over... and I've decided that band is pretty... ["Baby, One More Time" playing] Hot. Excuse me. What? What are you doing sitting in my seat? Does it say your name on it or something? Yes. So, if you don't mind, shoo-shoo. Let's go. Can you believe her? -Hi, Jenna. -Hey. Welcome, everyone. Settle, please. I should tell you right away... you'll notice that we are a bit cramped in here... thanks to some temporary storage foisted on us... by someone who has absolutely no appreciation... of what we do in here. Now, if you'll go to the beginning of the piece... Can I help you football guys? Yes, please. Careful! Jindraike. I'd like to... # Standin' here lookin' out on the world # # For a second nobody's lookin'back at me # # I never even notice where they go # # The sun is shining down and # # There's no one else around now # # Wish you were here to hear me say # # This is gonna be # # My greatest day # # How far would I go # # Just to hear everybody say # # This is gonna be # # My greatest day # # My greatest day # # My greatest day # Hey, Tad. Did you miss me? This is Tad. He totally rules the animal shelter. I helped nurse him when he was a baby chimp... and we've been buds ever since. Hey, Max! Hi, Marley. What's up? Could you do me a favor and feed the goat? Sure. What's going on? Didn't you hear? We're closing down. Some creep bought up the property... and canceled our lease. What's gonna happen to the animals? We're doing the best we can to find homes for them... but we only got until the end of the week. It's messed up, I know. It's real messed up. I couldn't believe it. Something had to be done, but what? I thought maybe my parents might have an idea. They did. We're moving?! Yeah. Foge wants me to head up the new division. I can't believe this. When? -Friday. -This Friday? Man, this is totally unfair! I mean, my life is here, my friends are here. We know that, Max. But you'll make plenty of new friends in Chicago. Chicago?! This was gonna be my year. Here. Sweetie, we know this is hard on you. It's hard on all of us. Well, then I have a great, great idea. Let's not go. Foge is my boss. He's counting on me. Can't you just say no? No. It's not that simple. This bites. He'll be fine. But, Max, Chicago's 1,000 miles away. Better tell your parents to watch out for carjackers. These guys'll just come up to you... at stoplights and take your car away. I saw it on "20/20." That's why they call it the Motor City. Maybe you could hire a lawyer and legally emancipate yourself. You can stay with me. I'll ask my mom. My dad'll give you a job here at the junkyard. You know what? Nice try, guys. You know what? Face it, I've been foged. We meet again, paperboy. OK. Evil Ice Cream Man, me. You're wondering why, right? Ohh! I once found a cockroach in my snow cone. My mom called the health department... and he got nailed. He's been trying to nail me ever since. Drat! The fuzz! This isn't over, paperboy! Hello, officer. Snow doodle? Hey, look, it's dumpster boy. It's Rinky Stinko, the garbage kid. Ha, Rinky Stinko. He just made that up. Now, that's good. MEGAN: Hey, Max, check it out. I made some flyers to help save the animal shelter. I thought you and I could put them up around school. Why bother? A flyer's not gonna make any difference. He didn't mean that. Cover me. I'm going in. He moves, he fakes. Rangoon, think fast. Nice hands. Now, pick up the ball... and put it in the case. It's from Knebworth's City Championship game. I'm going on my walkabout. Mrs. Rangoon, what's this? Some of the kids are trying to save... the animal shelter down the street. Kids? What kids? The ones with the sense of caring and civic duty. You there. Cease! What is the meaning of this? Hey, I didn't do that. So you want to save the filthy little beasts, eh? Perhaps you want me to give the animals my car? Do you want me to give my car to the smelly goat? Goats don't drive, sir. I don't care what you want me to do. The smelly goat will never get my car. Ever. The animals have nowhere to go. Some creep's closing down the shelter. I'm closing down the shelter, silly boy. What? All I need now is the right bulldozer. I'm thinking big and yellow. Where did you think I was going to build... Knebworth stadium, in your house? Ha ha. Your house. That's rich. There wouldn't be room. Whoa. # Better watch out for the king of the hill # # He's really bad and totally chill # # Better watch out for the king of the hill # Freak with robe? All right, guys. Hit the showers. Come on, ladies. Hello, freak. Let me out! Come on, let me out! What's going on, huh? McGinty's latest victim. You gotta check this out. Ha ha ha. ROBE: Let me out! Come on! Let me out! Come on, let me out. -All right, OK. -Come on, Max. OK. It's OK. He's a little claustrophobic, so he might... Hurl. What a waste of a perfectly good chili omelet. Let me check the latest rates. That's $3.00 for number one... and $5.00 for number two. I have a bladder problem. Sorry to hear it. -Keeble. -Get off me! I worked really hard on that display. Excuse me. New customers. DOBBS: Can I help you, gentlemen? -No, thanks. -Keeble, shut up. How much for a swirlie? Take stall number 4. No, no. Come on, Troy. -No charge. -Thanks, man. Can we talk about this? I'm gonna get my hair wet. Come on, Troy! Ow! Come on! Water. A recurring geographical feature which allows... a civilized society to develop. For example, rivers, springs... Mr. Keeble? You're tardy, and you're dripping. I have rules against both. Now, class, another feature which allows... a civilized society to develop is a code of rules. Without rules, society would completely collapse. Do you agree with that statement, Mr. Keeble? I guess so. I guess you'll write me a 2,000-word essay... on the subject. That's not fair! Which I will look forward to seeing on my desk... drip-dry Friday! This Friday? This Friday! Wait. Friday was the day I was moving... and this teacher was mean. She let Dobbs steal my money. She wanted to punish me when it wasn't my fault. But if I wasn't gonna be here... what could she really do to me, right? It was time to take a stand. How come I can't do the essay right now? Now, class... Mmm. That's good. A civilized society does need a set of rules. Otherwise, people could do this. Oops. Did I say 2,000 words? Make that 4,000! Or... this. Make that 8,000 words, and take your seat now! 8,000 words? That's kid stuff. How about 12,000 words? Do I hear 12,000 words, ladies and gentlemen? 12,000 words! Sold! For 12,000 words! Get off my desk! Okee-day. You're in serious trouble, Mr. Keeble. # Yeah # See ya. Hello, sweetheart. No consequences. I could do anything I wanted. Excuse me. Where do you think you're going? If you're ever in the windy city... Iook me up. Anything. And now, all the people who had tried to run us down... mess us up, push us around... were in for a real surprise. Told you it was gonna happen sooner or later. Didn't I? Yes, I did. Yes, I did. # Wait, see # # I do whatever moves me # I'm closing down the shelter. Pheromones... nature's dating service. I keep my money in a piggy bank. It just looks like you. After all, I had to do something about the bullies. All I needed was a little bit of help. Because I'm outta here in 2 days. Don't you see? This isn't just a plan. It's... it's a planetarium. Look, I'm gonna be the one they come after... but I'm not gonna be here... and that is the beauty of it. I mean, you guys won't even know what I'm up to. All you have to do is help me out. And we'll have... what do you call it? Plausible deniability. Plausible deniability. Did you just make that up? So we all down for the cause? One question. Can't we just have a going-away party instead? We will, a huge blowout... when this is over. So? Marching call! # You know a fella's good for the moola # Looks like somebody froze your assets, man. Let's see what we can do about that. Hey! Step off, capitalist tool. Man, why don't you go get a real job, fool? I told you, their lunch money is mine, vendor. Yeah, that's right. Trading hours are over. Hello, Vladimir. # MacGoogles is me name # # I like a swampy bog # # It's time to play a game with your... # Hmm. # MacGoogles is me name # # I like a swampy bog # # MacGoogle... # # MacGoogles is me name # # I like a swampy bog # # It's time to play a game # # With your favorite Highland... # # MacGoogles is me name # # I like a swampy bog # # It's time to play a game # # With your favorite Highland frog # And let me just remind... the citizens of Curtis Junior High... that we are now T-minus... several hours... until the Superintendent Knebworth visit. That is all. Thank you. I'm a walrus, hey. The camera's still on! OK. I'm OK. Sorry. I know. It's just that we have to be... very careful with the lab equipment. Our budget is very tight... thanks to the new football program. 45 cents. Cool. Let's check my grosses today. Where's my handheld? Hey, mister, my Fudgsicle's melting! Oh, it's supposed to be melting. People pay extra for that. Now, beat it! All of you, beat it! The heat is on! Fartknocker! Evil Ice Cream Man's going down. How great. I sure am gonna miss you guys. I guess you'll make new friends in Chicago. Right, Max? I guess so. I don't know. I never really thought about it. Hey, maybe you'll meet kids... exactly like us in every way. You know, like clones. Yeah. Maybe I will. Well, there's still your going-away party. There's gonna be a cake and everything. -I baked it. -Yeah, don't forget. Tomorrow, 4:00, House of Robe. I'm providing the ice cream. ICE CREAM MAN: What's going on?! It's melting! Hey, Max? What are you doing? Stuff. Getting ready for the big move kind of stuff? Mm-hmm. I'm sorry we sprung this on you, Max... but it was sort of sprung on me the same way. Uh-huh. OK. Tsk. What if I didn't take the job? What then? A home... the food we eat, the clothes you wear... that takes a lot of money. I just can't see why we can't stay. Well, sometimes in life... you gotta do things that you don't want to do... because other people who have power over you... tell you to do them. No, Dad, I mean, if you rise up... and... and show that you're not afraid... those people will no longer have control over your life. What have you done with Max? Who are you? Really? Good night, kiddo. See ya. The window was open. Whoa! Robe. The computer. I'll get the breath spray. Nature's dating service. Whoa. -What? -Check it out. Jindraike's using all the school's money... to build his stupid football stadium. We can't let him get away with that. Now his breath'll be pheromone fresh. Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Here you go. And now we add a little decoration. Whoa! Come on, let's get out of here. Robe! Come on, man! Let's go! Yeah, I'm trying. Morning, Mom. Morning, Mom. Hi, sweetie. Whatcha doing? You know, you just start out... by trying to pack everything really fast... and then you get caught up in all this old stuff. Remember how the kitchen looked... when we first moved in? Before it was perfect? Not really. I was four. Right. Mmm. Sorry about the short notice, Max. You having to leave your friends and everything. Ah, it's OK. At first, I was really bummed out... but not everything's bad about moving. That's what your father keeps saying. I hope you're both right. Troy McGinty? How about that? OK, no, I won't do that anymore. I promise. I promise. Ohh. I lied. Sorry. # MacGoogles is me name # # I like a swampy bog # No. # With your favorite Highland frog # No. No, not you. You're not even real! Get away from me! Faster, janitor! More commemorative red, white, and blue streamers. Crazy Legs Knebworth. What a champion he was. Come on, you idiot. He's coming! He's coming! Straighten up. Straighten up. Better. Ready? And... At last! At last! The moment we've all been waiting for. Crazy Legs. You look fit. Elliot. It's been too long. I agree completely. Slip me that biscuit. Ooh, that's a hot one. Smile. The reason Jindraike has a new football program... is to impress this guy... Superintendent Knebworth. You see, Jindraike wants his job so bad... he'd eat his socks. How it saddens me... to think of your retirement, Crazy Legs. What an inspiration you've been to us all. In fact, I've collected some mementos... from your glory days. Well. Remember this? Eww! It's your championship jockstrap. We washed it. Ha ha. Wash it again. What's this? Allow me to present... Knebworth Stadium. Knebworth Stadium. How can you afford to do something like this? I didn't approve any capital expenditures for Curtis. The usual... bake sales, car washes... and cutting back on a few non-essential items. -Fire extinguishers, milk. -Excuse me? Moving along... have you seen the toilets? No complaints. I need five laps to... All right, that's weird. Who turned out the lights? Hey, check it out. It's McGinty! What the... Hey, break it up. Break it up. McGinty. He's... gonna eat me. What? MacGoogles. "Look who's crying now." Would you guys get out of here? So the second teacher says, "I agree. "That's why they call it a lounge." Ha. Well, here we are... in the Curtis Junior High library. Hmm. Smallish. Yes, but we're biggish on books. Especially sports books. The one we're waiting for is "Crazy Legs"... "The Bobby Knebworth Story." Didn't I order new computer workstations this year? Jindraike? We're having them upgraded. Hmm. OK. Well... if it isn't my favorite customer. What can I get you, plump daddy? What's this? Who are you working for? "If you want the ice back in your ice cream... "meet me at the junkyard at 3:00." Somebody's messing with me. Hey, can I try the soup? Everything set? I guess so, but I still don't see... how this is gonna help save the animal shelter. It's all part of the plan. Max... What? I don't know. I'd just rather spend our last day... hanging out than doing all this spy stuff. -Uhh! -Ow! What the... Big oaf. They're coming! Right on schedule. -You ready? -Check. Lunch... is... served. Check and mate.

That's what I do. That's what I do. This can't happen to me. You know what they're calling me out there? The MacGoogler. Troy, easy. Now, I'd like to take you through... a childhood regression process. It may bring up some unpleasant memories... but I think you'll find it helpful in the end. All righty? Mm-hmm. Now, give Mr. MacGoogles a hug. Aah! Aah! He's gonna eat me! We've got some work to do. $300 for a new handheld? There goes my third quarter. "Meet me 3 P.M. today at the junkyard... "if you want to put your handheld back in your hand." "P.S. Bring the metal coil." Son, your mama found a metal coil... on the front porch. Is it yours? Metal coil. I want my coil. I want my handheld! What did you say, punk? I said, "I want my handheld." You want your handheld? Yeah. You heard me. I said, "I want my handheld." You want me to hold your hand? No! Need somebody to hold his hand. Little baby. Little... Give me the coil! Oh, this? Huh? Huh? No! Yeehaw! Meh-meh-meh. Good, Troy! Now... can you help me find a link... between MacGoogles and your fears? Was it something from your past... or somebody? Keeble! Keeble! Keeble. Hey, Max. Hi, Jenna. Do you want to hang out? I'm meeting some friends at Buddies. You know what? I actually gotta kinda be somewhere. Oh, come on. Stay for one milk shake. It'll be fun. Well... One milk shake. You know what? OK. All right. One... milk shake. # Hit me, baby, one more time # [Chanting "Keeble"] So, you actually did set up... that whole monkey thing at the cafeteria? Well, actually, Tad is a chimpanzee. You're so devious. Well, it's really part of my whole new attitude... what I like to call my phat-itude. Yo! Don't crowd the man, dude. He has phat-itude. Git! I wonder where Max is? Don't worry.

She really likes you. Robe, wait. You know what? I've been waiting. Now I'm going home. Have a nice life in Chicago. Well, can you tell her that I called? And that I'm really, really sorry. -I'll tell her, Max. -Thanks. And don't forget the sorry part, please. -I won't. -Thank you. Bye. Hey, champ. You seen your mom? Hey, honey, can you come here quick? I got big news. What's up? Guess what? We're not moving. We're not? Uh-uh. I finally gave Foge some of his own medicine. You foged Foge? Yeah. I quit. We're gonna stay here. I'm gonna start my own business. Oh, sweetie! Now you're gonna be the big cheese! Not anymore! Wait! We're not moving? Uh-uh. Oh, look at him. He's so happy, he can't speak! Ha ha ha! Hey, honey, can you help me get this off? I sure can! I can't get it over my head with the gloves. What was I gonna do? I had to get out of this. Max, this is gonna be great. I finally get to be my own boss. But, Dad, what about your responsibilities... the house, the food, my clothes? What about my clothes? Do I wear rags? Max, I owe it all to you. You're the one that helped me realize... Foge was nothing but a bully. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have had... the courage to stand up to him. I'm just a kid! What do I know? You OK? You seem a little jumpy. Yes! Yeah. -You sure? -Yeah. I'm cool. So, see you tonight. -Uh, yeah. -Yeah. Maybe. Maybe? Who was I kidding? I was Grade-A dead meat, and I knew it. What I didn't know... is that I've left my friends in the same boat. It's gonna be a long year for you, slim. I'm gonna pound you every day. And all thanks to your good friend Keeble. Catch you around, huh? Great. Let's just round it off to all your money forever. From here on in, you work for me. Heh heh! Yeah. In fact, the entire school was going to suffer... because of me. Oh, stop smiling. This is not a happy place. Find Max Keeble. I'd like to speak to him. You better book a flight. What? Max Keeble moved to Chicago. I just forwarded his file. Mrs. Rangoon, a moment of your time, please. Someone's got something important... to say to the students. Someone's got something very important... to say to the students, and do you know... who that someone is, Mrs. Rangoon? It's me, Mrs. Rangoon. Hmm. Yeah. And wait till they hear it. Attention, students. Because of yesterday's crimes against the school... instigated by your former classmate Max Keeble... the following extracurricular activities... are now suspended... art, music, P. E... fun! Suspended, discontinued, defunct! Great. Your boyfriend Max Keeble... just got us hosed. He's just my paperboy. I never really liked him. Keeble! OK. Today, class, we're going to review... some of the elements of grammar. McGinty says he's gonna pound me... every day for the rest of my life. Dobbs says I have to give him all of my money... forever. Some plausible deniability. Hi. Do you mind if I hang here for a while... because there's some people after me. I did some stuff. Yeah. You probably... Yeah. I'm really sorry about the cafeteria. But Jindraike has no right to do what he's doing... and now my friends are gonna get whaled on because of me... and I can't do anything about it. Any kid can make a mess. Takes a man to clean it up. It took a man with a plunger... to make me realize that I had to do something. I thought I'd stood up to the bullies... but all I'd really done was hit and run. That's not courage. That's ex-courage. As you know, verbs are words that describe actions... so who can name a few? Betray, deceive, lie. How about burn... screw over, stab in the back? Heh! Uh-huh. Attention, students, this is Max Keeble speaking. First I'd like to say to my friends Megan and Robe... that I know that I acted like a jerk... and I'm sorry for ever getting you involved in this. I screwed up, but you guys are my best friends... and that's forever. I don't know what else to say, but I'm sorry. It probably doesn't matter to you anymore... but I'm not moving. Keeble! And McGinty and Dobbs... it's me you want, so leave my friends alone. I may have run before, but I am all through running now. You want me, I'll be in the parking lot, 3:00. Cut! End of broadcast! That is all. Thank you. Hello, Max. Good to see you. Glad you could make it. Please, have a seat. Anything I can get for you? Sparkling water? Soda? No? OK. You've acted like a criminal... so I'm going to treat you like a criminal. I'm not a criminal. People who do crimes are criminals, like you. You should be careful before slandering... your principal's spotless reputation... with wild and groundless claims. They're not groundless, they're ground-full. -Ground-full? -Look it up! I saw it on the screen. You have been stealing from all the school budgets... to fund your stupid football stuff. Saw it on the screen, did you? Yeah, and it's true. You're a smart little boy... but so am I! So I fiddled with the budget. Fiddlesticks. It's my budget. So we have fewer textbooks. Big deal. Textbooks are for nerds. Fewer band instruments... who cares? Band is for losers. -Come on! -Oh! So the janitor has to work overtime for no pay. He should pay me for the privilege! Now, let me describe your next 24 hours. I'm going to mete out a punishment to you... that is so severe, future generations... will refer to it as "The Keeble." They will beg on bended knee... "Oh, please, sir. Not the Keeble, sir. "I swear I'll never misbehave again... "if you'll just spare me... the Keeble." And spare them I shall, Max... for I am a merciful man. Your transgressions are so immense... that I would be delinquent... My bulldozer! Oh, goody. Oh, that's right! You don't know! You thought you saved the animal shelter. It would appear... not! Now stay there! Don't go away. What do you think Jindraike'll do to him? What do you think McGinty and Dobbs'll do to him? # We got evil trouble # Maybe they'll just forget the whole thing. # Evil trouble # # We got evil trouble # Or maybe they'll rip his head off. We've got to do something. Come on. # We got evil trouble # # We got evil trouble # Good afternoon, Mr. Dobbs. Always a pleasure, McGinty. This is gonna be epic. "Keeble canceled." Here's Jinny. Keeble? Keeble! Sacrilege! Open this door immediately! Caged like an animal. Ironic. So, is my watch running fast... or is our Keeble friend running scared? Somebody looking for me? Keeble, welcome to our parking lot of pain. You know how doctors say, "This won't hurt a bit"? Well, I'm not a doctor, and neither is McGinty here. He's right. I'm not a doctor. Yeah! Oh, you know, that's too bad... because you're gonna need one. Hold him! Let him go! Megan, I'm handling this! So am I. Ha ha ha! What are you gonna do about it, huh? This. [Plays "We're Not Gonna Take It"] Oh. OK. [Band playing "We're Not Gonna Take It"] I'm so scared. You should be. We're taking back our school. Yeah. No more being pushed around. No more being stepped on. No more Mr. Not-nice Guy. Your reign of terror over the student body... has come to an abrupt halt. What? Yes, please. From now on, you have to pay us... to use the restroom. We're pulling your plug! Throw them in the dumpster! -Swirlie! -Yeah! Get them! It was all his idea! It was his idea! It was all McGinty! Put me down! Wait! Wait! What are we doing?! Getting revenge on the bullies. But that makes us the same as them. Don't you see? I mean, I went about all this the wrong way. We are no better than the bullies... if we do exactly what the bullies do. I mean, we need to stand together... and make our school a better place for everyone! For you and you and you and even you, worried kid. -Man's got a point. -Yeah! What should we do with them? Let them go. No! Wow! How cool are you? You know. Just... A bunch of us are having a party this weekend. Ninth graders only. Except for you, Max. I'm sorry. I can't come. I'm meeting somebody. Shoo shoo! Whatever. Nice move, Max. You know what? I think not moving... was the best move of all. It's Jindraike! He's heading for the animal shelter! That's it! Run! Scatter like the children you are! Knock, knock. Anybody home? Giddyap! All right! Who's first?! I know! How about the smelly goat?! Baa! Not today, Jindraike. That's far enough. On second thought, why don't we start with the boy... who tried to save the smelly goat? I do not fear your dark powers, bald one. Your kung fu's no good here, Max. Oh, what is that... Eek! Eek! Pbbbt! Pbbbt! Traitor! Cease! He did it! All right, Max! Yep! I did it! The animal shelter was safe... the bullies were cooked... and Jindraike got fired for fiddling with the budget. As for me and my friends, we were just happy... that the first week of school was over. Now we could chill for the rest of the year. I'll get you, paperboy!
