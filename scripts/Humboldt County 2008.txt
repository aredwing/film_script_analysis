I parked it about a half a mile down the road and I walked home. But my boyfriend heard. Hmm. He hears everything. When he came in to see what was wrong, I just tried to pretend to be asleep. But I couldn't hold it in. I started to cry. Go on. Sorry. I was bawling my eyes out. He held me. And I wished-- I wished I hadn't done it. I wished-- It was still inside me and it was still alive. Mm-hmm. I've had four of them now. I don't know why, but when I make love I can't feel anything. - ( cough ) - Shh! - Sometimes I think-- - Mmm. Well-- I can't really see a reason to keep trying, to keep going. Aren't you supposed to say something? I mean, I just told you I'm thinking about killing myself and have no reason to live. Um, yeah. Yeah. I think a prescription of, uh, Paxil, uh, might be the uh, the right prescription. Mm-hmm. Okay. Anything else, Peter? Hmm? Um, "...can't feel anything... ...reason to keep going..." Paxil? Really? All right. Sandra, you're up next. Okay. He said you should go in now. Oh, thanks. He's a bit of a curmudgeon, isn't he? He's-- he's not so bad. I have something for you. - Here. - Peter? Later, alligator. This an acceptance into one of the best residency programs in the country. I was hoping this meeting would be a celebration. But I-- I have to fail you. What? I can try harder. I've been studying nonstop. I haven't slept in three days. I'm doing rounds, I-- - I'm a little-- - If today's exam had been real, you would have put a life in danger. And although I believe you could make a great doctor, I have my own moral imperative. But Dad, if I fail, I won't graduate. I'll lose the residency. Peter, we worked so hard for this. I'm unbelievably disappointed. Congratulations. - ( toilet flushes ) - ( stall opens ) Mmmm. Idiot.

Thank you. My band! That place was too noisy-- Puts my brain in such a huff. Hmm. So, you're an actress or a singer or something? ( giggles ) Those are just little gigs when I'm coming through L.A. - Mmm. - You seem so sad. Oh, um, my name's Peter Hadley. - Hi, Peter Hadley. - Hi. I'm Bogart. Is that your real name? No. ( laughs ) Uh, oh, um-- Er er-- you're trapped! ( laughs ) - Trapped. - ( grunts ) - ( watch beeps ) - Oh, sorry. I should tell you, I've never really, uh-- I mean, um-- I don't know how to put this. I don't really have any money. Do you take checks? ( laughs ) Oh, wow! ( laughing ) Oh my God. Peter Hadley! Oh, wow! - I feel terrible. - Oh my God! Oh, Peter Hadley. I'm sorry. Man, oh man, can't a girl just have casual sex anymore without being labeled some kind of a-- - No no no. - But-- No no no. I mean, yes. Uh, yes, casual sex. I just-- - I just, um-- - Yay. I just didn't think you were actually interested. Huh. Peter Hadley. I'm sorry. You're just not too good with people yet, are you? What do you-- mmm. ( boot zipper zipping ) What are you doing? Going for a drive. Where are you going? Going home. Want to come with me? Are you sure you want to come? Huh? It's a long drive. Are you sure you want to come? Yeah. Okay. Do you need anything? No. Okay.

PETER: Where are we? BOGART: Home. Is this Malibu? No. They call this the last coast. It won't be last for much longer, I can tell you. Wal-Mart is marching in. Oh God! Are we chasing someone? And don't be fooled by the whole peace-love-nature-hippie, you know, spirit-thing. People that have moved here take the business of marijuana very serious, you know? Wait. Marijuana? Like drug, uh, pushers? "Drug pushers." No, growers, farmers, you know. Not me. I got out. Here, grab the wheel for a second. Uh, I think that's a-- We're fine, we're fine. You're good. Thank you. Should you be smoking while we're-- Oh yeah, believe me, I need it. ( coughs ) It's all gravy in the navy. ( laughs ) Are you ready? For? ( car door opens ) Uh, Bogart? Hello? ( car door closes ) Bogart? Bogart? ( gunshot ) Oh God! MAN: Fuck you! Oh God. Fuck you, motherfucker! Jack, put down the fucking gun! What is going on here? Oh, Rosie's roses were so beautiful this year. They were just beautiful. They were gorgeous. And then this little cocksucker deer-- What is it, Jack? ( twig snaps ) How many times have I told you not to sneak up on us like that? Now you march yourself out here - right now, little miss! - God damn it, Jack! - You could have killed our--! - Sorry, Grandpa. I was just playing. - Oh, Annabelle! - ( laughter ) You are getting so big I can't carry you. Where's your daddy? - Come on inside. - Hi. ( laughing/coughing ) ( both laughing ) - Earl Earl Earl! - ( clapping ) Good to see you, buddy. It's good to see you, man. Yeah, been a while. - Hey. - Looking good. So are you. Good God. ( girl meowing ) ( laughing ) - Hi there. - ( growls ) Are you a kitty cat? ( hisses ) Oh, no thank you. Thank you. ( exhales ) Putting dogs on leashes is a goddamn shame. Think about it-- dogs, wild animals, ( hisses ) But it isn't just that we put these beautiful creatures on leashes that really pisses me off. It's the completely frightening fact that we have created an environment where if we don't put the dogs on the leashes they'll walk into the street and get killed by a car. Two-ton slabs of metal hurtling at high speed down a concrete path-- Those aren't supposed to exist in nature. They aren't natural. Natural. Motherfuckers. You should try some. It takes the city edge right off. I'm fine. ( laughs ) Let's get you started off. Hey, sweater vest, you one of Bogart's strays? - Um, yeah. - Yes? You know you're nothing special. Thank you. I'll keep that in mind. You know, she might not want to talk to you-- You guys, you go easy on him. Just saying hello. Hey, Bogey, haven't seen you in a while. How's it going? You're looking very Humboldt, Steve-O. Thank you very much. Yeah. ( giggles ) So what's been going on with you guys? Aw, you know, the usual shit. We're fixing up the place. We got an HDTV. It's huge. It's fucking monstrous. - Listen, I-- - Oh, we're also going in together with Max on an ATV this summer. I'm not going in on shit with you guys. Well, you must be saving up for something, right? I haven't seen you in town much, Max. PETER: Can I have a word? Fellas, I've been busy. - It's been busy. - PETER: Excuse me-- STEVE: Busy, yeah, whatever. Hey, listen, we got a new sound system. You guys want to check it out? - Yeah, we got a subwoofer. - This thing is awesome. - PETER: Bogart-- - It's huge. It's got like four speakers... PETER: Bogart-- - It's the subwoofer-- - Right, it's the subwoofer. - Subwoofer? - Yeah. Let's check it out. - Check it out? - Come on. - How many speakers? - Bogart! I need to go home. - Oh, here we go! - ( all whooping ) MAN #1: The Genny's going. Genny's going. MAN #2: Genny's going. Listen, I'll give you a ride to the bus stop in the morning, okay? - I love you, daddy. Good night. - Good night. Charity, honey, can you show Peter where he can crash? I'll follow you? CHARITY: It's a little hard to see. I'm sorry. Hey, why do they call your mom Bogart? Uh, she's not my mom. Oh. Because she Bogarts the pot. She-- A verb which means to hold instead of pass. You shouldn't know about all this stuff. What stuff? All the, uh, the marijuana. It's just a plant. Yeah, but you're so young. I think it's nicer than beer. You're funny. Where is your mother? She died a long time ago. Oh. - So, Bogart-- - She's kind of like my aunt. Her parents left, so my grandma and grandpa adopted her when she was little. Hmm. My daddy and her have sex. Wow. They say it's okay to have sex with other people, but I don't think they really mean it. Yeah. Did you have sex with Bogart? Uh, did I-- Uh-- - I don't feel comfortable talking-- - Okay. So, do you want me to read you a book? What do you have? Oh, here's my favorite. How about "the closing of the American mind"? That'll do. Okay. - ( kissing ) - BOGART: Mmm... MAX: You should help me with my crop. How much are you growing? How much? Uh-- A lot? More than a lot. - Nnnn... - No, but I've got a system, okay? - Max, no! - I just need a couple of hands at the end. You know that a big crop is messy. - You know that people notice. - Jesus Christ, you sound like fuckin' Jack. Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Oh! - Babe, once I get this harvest done... - ( moans ) Charity, she'll have a real home. Then I'm gonna farm a legal crop, I swear to you. It sounds good, baby, it does. - But-- - But what? What would I do? Where would I stay? You'd stay with me. No. Why not? Because. Because why? God damn it, man! It's this place. It's beautiful, Max, but it's a fuckin' trap. I can't be here! So what are you gonna do, go to another city and sing a few more songs until you pick up another little parasitic fuck-- - Ugh. You know-- - What is that guy? - What's his name again? - Peter. His name's Peter. - Oh, you know his name. That's interesting. - Yeah, I know his name. - 'cause normally you don't even know his fucking name! - Why are you doing this? Why am I doing what, asking you to stay? Trying to figure out once and for all why you won't, or you don't, or you can't-- I just can't. Anyway... - I love you. - I love you too. I love you too. Hey, get up! - Get up! They shot 'em! - Huh? For the drugs! Man, they're all dead. - We gotta get the fuck out of here. - What? - The drugs, man! We're fucked! - Oh my God! - We gotta get the fuck out! - Oh my God!!! - ( Peter screaming ) - Daddy, Peter... ( screaming ) ( yelling, laughing ) - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah, we outta here! We're out of here. Good morning! Good morning! ( screams ) "oh my God!" MAX: Oh my God! It hurts, it hurts me! ( both continue screaming ) What do you mean she's gone? Like the wind. She rarely stays for more than a night. A child of Humboldt either can't leave or can't stay. - I might have pissed her off a little. ( chuckles ) - Is she coming back? She might-- yeah, she'll be back in like a week-- - Or a year. - CHARITY: 10 years. MAX: 10 years. No service. Fuck! Fuck! - Oh, sorry. - That's okay. Thank you. - Are these too burnt? - That looks okay. I think you really like them burnt, so I don't know. Voicemail. Uh, hi, Dad. It's Peter. Hadley. I'm um-- Right now I'm-- This is funny. ( chuckles ) You're gonna think this is really funny but, um-- You see, there was this-- ( dialing ) Yeah. I think that's kind of toasty, though. Dad, it's me, Peter, again. Listen, I'm um-- Listen, I know there's some way to sort this all out, And I'm going to handle it. I don't want you to worry. I've just got to get back to L.A. See, I'm, well-- I'm not-- These are good. - Right now I'm in the middle of-- - Banana? of the um-- well, it's like I was saying, there was th-- Okay, I've really got to get out of here. I'll take you to town when I get back from the store. Um, no, you don't understand. I-- Be back in a half hour. Stay put. Eat up, Charity. CHARITY: Okay. Okay, that's 100 back. Here's your receipt. Oh God. Oh, this is-- illegal. ( door closes ) I'm in a house of crazy people. Um, Mr. Truman? Jack? Yes, I can hear you. Must I acknowledge? Oh, uh, I can't seem to find the bathroom. ( laughs ) ( rock playing on stereo ) PETER: Why are we stopping? Jack said he saw some tweakers. I just want to check on my plants. - Oh. - Stay here. I'll be right back. Um... Max? - Max? Max? - ( tools jangling ) We gotta get to the bus station. Max. - Max, the bus leaves in-- - Patience. Virtue. Et cetera. Fuck. Where have you been? Oh, shit. ( laughs ) It is late. It is late. ( whistles ) I'll tell you, this business, I mean, it's very unpredictable. - I'm on call too. - Can we go? I gotta get to the bus station. I'm filled with guilt about this one, I really am. - You missed the last bus. - What? Not a lot of options here. ( spits ) This is cold. - I missed the bus. - Not a lot of options here. Oh, Jesus. I would have been back sooner, man, but I ran into an irrigation issue. Problematic. I missed the bus. - It's just for a day, man. - You don't understand. It's not just a day. I can't afford to waste any more time here. I need to get back and get things in order-- Maybe you should have thought about that earlier, before you came up north. But that Bogart, Lotta temptation. Hey. Road's right there. You're more than welcome to throw up a thumb. - Okay. - ( kicks bucket ) I will. ( chuckles ) It's only a day. ( sighs ) It's only a day. You're here for the night, right? This is good. I got an irrigation issue. It's a two-man job. I could use you. I can't exactly take an ad out in the paper. I don't know. Helping with a marijuana-- plantation. You can't live your entire life by the books, can you? ( birdcall ) ( birdcall ) Easy, easy. Is this your marijuana garden? How many are there? A half dozen, enough to get by. White, raping, slave-owning motherfuckers. - You hear me? - I do. ( phone rings ) That's what they are. I don't have no time to be bothered with raping, slave-owning motherfuckers. - ( phone ringing ) - Should someone get that? They got a monopoly at the general store. Ain't no different from fuckin' Wal-Mart, Except it's in my goddamn backyard. Bob and Steve is here. They comin'. They comin', baby. They're coming to build their hotels and their houses, and the gas stations-- the traffic. They're coming from the Beverly Hills mansions, and they gonna rape the land, they gonna rape the women, and they gonna rape my fuckin' asshole. But what's wrong with some development? I mean, a lot of these homes are very poorly constructed. Fuck off and die. JACK: What happened? Did they leave anything? - No. - Not a one. Do you have enough money to last you? - A couple of months. - We're fucked. Well, you can certainly clip for us in the fall. It's the Feds, ripping every last plant out of the earth. - BOB: It wasn't the Feds. - We were robbed, Zelda. They fucking hit me with a gun barrel. BOB: They jacked our fucking plants. - Fucking Feds. - The Feds don't run into your patch with a gun - and fucking pistol-whip you. - I saw them. It wasn't the Feds. Solids and liquids are differentiated one from another by the way the material responds to stress. If the material deforms, stays deformed, or springs back when the stress is removed, it's a solid. If instead the material flows when stressed and rearranges itself in such a way as to remove the stress, it's a liquid. In the past there's been too many secrets, too much espionage. We're gonna have to adapt if we expect to survive. Have I gone insane and completely forgotten inviting you in here? Sorry. I went out to pee, and, um-- Get the fuck out. Right. ( harrumphs, chuckles ) Have an edifying day at school. ( laughs ) - Bonjour, Jack. - a va? We were wondering whether you or Max would be contributing to the pencil patch this year. Both, actually, Lord willing. Merci. We are very grateful. - Glad to do our part. - Excuse me. Children, allez! Vite! The pencil patch? A while back a bunch of us got tired Driving our kids 50 Miles to school. So we built this place, funded annually by the parents of the children who can. One or two plants-- pencil patch. My God. If my father heard that I think his head would explode. The complexities of the modern father-son relationship. Hasn't changed much. Well, you and Max seem to get on pretty well. It's complicated, captain. I guess we haven't reached the event horizon yet. The event horizon? The event horizon is the point around a Black Hole where nothing beyond that point can escape, even light. My point is is it's your big kahuna point of no return. If you had crossed it-- that event horizon-- how would you know? Because you would be ripped apart molecule by molecule. You're still intact, so I wouldn't worry about it. - Yeah. - ( school bell rings ) Oh, hey. You ready to go to the bus station? Uh-- Ahem-- ( laughs ) Critter control, slick. Oh, yeah. It helps protect the plants. Why don't you do that side over there? ( whispering ) Oh, these buds. Oh my God. Fuckin' purple. I love it. - ( peeing ) - Beautiful. How long have you been smoking that? I went into my mom's stash when I was-- Eight. Or nine. When I was eight I was-- I was drinking Kool Aid and watching "The Smurfs." You have your drugs, I have mine. Let me see that. What? It's medicine, right? It's just a flower, man. Go for it. Just-- It's not so bad. You gotta hold it into your lungs. ( gags ) ( coughs ) You don't cough, you don't get off. Am I supposed to feel something now? 'Cause I don't feel anything, which is strange, because once inhaled, that THC should travel throughout the bronchial tree, bathing the brain and vital organs within seconds. I should feel something, shouldn't I? I don't feel high. Am I high? I don't feel high. ( birds chirping ) The sun-- Mmm. Mmm. I don't feel high. Don't you worry about the police? ( spits ) The local pigs? No way, man. The Feds-- they're the ones to worry about. They come later, during harvest. Man, these motherfuckers, they're funded. They got helicopters and spotter planes, ex-special forces. They came a few years back. I had enough plants-- maybe 10 or so, just to get by, pay my rent, get Charity some new school clothes, books and shit. But that's usually enough to do it-- Small plants, no problem. But that wasn't the case this time. They came flying in. I mean, the Feds, they want the big crops, right, so they can report that shit on the news. But they came flying in, circling around, man. They give you the death circle. If you get the death circle, You gotta run like hell, go down to the beach and wait it out. And hopefully when you get back, your crops are still there. You just run to the beach? The Feds just want the plants, man. If you're not around when they take them, then you skip the jail part. And that's when I lost everything, man. I lost everything. I moved into the trailer, I had to move Charity in with Jack and Rosie. That's the deal. ( grunts ) I tell you, the people around here, they don't have a plan, you know? I'm not in it for the HDTV and a fucking La-Z-Boy, you know? I'm taking care of my own. Max, I forgot about the bus. The bus. ROSIE: Oh, Charity, that's wonderful. Jack, look. Charity's rolled a beauty! She's a natural. - You're in. The first to Mars. - Really? - Mars? - Oh, God, Jesus. Gram's gonna colonize Mars. What, like the planet? - Stupid-- - ( door opens, closes ) It's an important project. Practically speaking, you're gonna have to terraform the planet, right? And the best way to do that-- I don't know any other way to say it-- You've got to shit outside. Step outside the dome and shit. We do it here all the time. It's no big deal. The outhouse is busy. Just shit outside. Will that take a long time? Yes, Peter, it will take a long time, which is exactly why I'm-- Jack, we're talking about colonizing a fucking planet here. It's a process. the world wasn't built in a day, Jack. It's a process. ( laughs ) ( laughs ) Over time, multiple generations, it will make a difference. Couldn't you just poo inside the dome and have plumbing pipes pump the poo outside? He said "poo"! Yes. Yes you could. You're a part of the project, Peter. You're in. Yes! That's great! You've been talking about Mars for years. This boy listens for one minute and alters the entire plan. Oh, that's a great idea. Okay, here's part two of the plan. You tell people, okay, you can come to Mars, be one of the first to colonize it, But you have to work long enough For a certain amount of time to be determined, and then you get a plot of land. You get to own a part of Mars. Anybody can do this? - What about criminals? - We'll allow criminals. What exactly is a criminal? Mars will be a place for people to have an entirely new start, totally fresh. Wouldn't that be just lovely? We're not gonna fuck this one up! We'd probably not allow murderers and rapists, but if you just stole a little something-- a candy bar, a kidney-- ROSIE: Mars would welcome you! The woman is out of her mind, out of her mind. I'm gonna tell you this: If that woman ever gets to Mars, you can forget about the planet. We will have to just move on to Venus. Well, Charlie used to love the idea. But now, this one right here-- That's a whole different story. This one should be the leader of the expedition. What do you say? Mayor of Mars. Well, I accept. # you may not romance # # or try to be smooth # # but that don't matter to me # # it's the loving I feel when you look in my eyes # # there's no other love but you # # when you're far away, love # # you still somehow stay, love # # of all mysteries above, love # # it's you I keep thinking of, love # # others may try to Loan me their hearts # # but they just would never do # # you've got my tender soul on a string # # there's no other love but you # # happy to be lazy # # dreaming on that hazy # # day we'll be pushing daisies # # me and my little crazy # # time tumbles on # # memories fade # # but this day will always be true # # oh, I am your gal # # and you are my man # # there's no other love but you. # MAX: Yeah!

What? What we're doing. Right now. Would you consider it sitting idly? I suppose. My father never let me sit idly. Must be a productive fucking guy, your dad. Yeah. My mother-- Couldn't stand it and she left when I was five. So-- Yeah, he'd literally say that. "You cannot sit idly. There's too much life to live, James." - James? - It's my middle name. Peter James. My middle name is the. I'm serious. No you're not. Your parents named you Max the Truman? No, my given middle name is Forrest, But I changed it, legally. When I was 11 years old I was obsessed with Alexander the Great, couldn't leave it alone. So I told them I was old enough to make my own decisions and god damn if they didn't let me do it. - That's awesome. - No it's not. It's fuckin' stupid. They should have told me to shut the fuck up. - ROSIE: This is very good. - Mmm-hmm. Very good. Your recipe. So, are we enjoying our summer here Amongst the lotus eaters, captain? Bob and Steve is here. So, when this is over, what next? - When this is over? - Mm-hmm. Hey, ho, professor! - You're a professor? - Was. - Of what? - Physics, of course. Those U.C.L.A. fascists still wish Jack would come back and publish the work that he and Charlie-- U.C.L.A.? I go-- went-- to U.C.L.A. University life is a complete distraction. We needed isolation and a place to focus. When this work is finished, the whole world will change. And you just left and came up here? When? Fuck, it's been 25 years. We needed to get away from stuff. Who wants more? - Me. - Me. I'm not staying here. I'm not giving up. I mean, this is just temporary. - You tell 'em, Pete. - I mean, who does that-- Seriously-- just abandons the world, Comes here, just stays? Jack, Rosie, you. - Yeah. - Also me. And other than that, just about everybody, Everybody up here. How'd you end up here? Same as you-- followed a girl. I didn't really follow a girl, my friend. I didn't really follow the same girl then. Wait. Y-y-you mean Bogart? Y-y-you mean Bogart? Really? No shit? - You too? - Huh-uh. I'm native. Hey, Sophie, you by yourself tonight? 'Course not. - Where's she going? - ( smooches ) You should just fucking bark at her, Steve. ( chuckles ) All right, let's get the fuck out of here. I'm not fucking going. Wai-- wh-- Those are the fuckers that probably robbed our patch. Those guys? You think so? I didn't tell anybody but Sophie where that fucking patch was. - You gonna say anything? - I'm gonna say something. You're not gonna fucking say anything. When I'm ready. I could say something now if I wanted to. - That's just wrong. - I will say it when I'm ready. Excuse me, gentlemen. Did you steal their plants? Yeah, Skipper, I'm talking to you. Did you steal their plants? - He asked you a question. - I'm serious, Mr. Lumberjack man. Now, I know you were raised in a barn, but you can't just go around stealing people's livelihood, because, you know, it's cowardly. - Hey! - What the fuck? - ( laughing ) - ( whooping ) PETER: ...The perfect argument against cloning. - No no no, look-- - Whoah, stop, stop. Shut the fuck up. I was up here the other day. There is something you gotta see. Come here. Shh. - Shh! - Shh! - ( whispering ) Oh my God. - What the fuck is this? Shh! Keep quiet. PETER: How many are there? Must be hundreds here, man. Some lucky fucking bastard is set. We should take a few. - Fuck, you think so? - Why not? It'll save our asses. There's so many here I don't think anyone would notice. All right, let's fucking do it. Hey, why is there a sleeping bag here? ( gunshot ) Gun! Gun! Go! Go! STEVE: I can't fucking see! I can't fucking see, man! ( gunshot ) BOB: Shut the fuck up! Go! Fuck! Fuck! Downhill! - Let's go! - Come on! ( man screams ) What the fuck? - What the fuck? - What was that huge patch? What the fuck are you doing? Are you kidding me? - Were those all yours? - What are you fuckin' doing? - Max, I had no idea. - Stay the fuck away! - Get out of here! - Max, I didn't know. Get the fuck out of here! Stay away from my fucking plants! - JACK: How many does he have? - Sorry? Don't be sorry. Just answer the question. How many does he have? How many? Sit down, Pete. This herb has been part of human civilization Since before it was civilized. Hemp fibers have been found in archaeological digs in the Asiatic communities in China dating back 4,000 B.C.E. Taoist monks in the fifth century thought it could tell the future. But it is currently illegal. I've lost too many friends over it, Good people-- not thieves, murderers, just people like you and me. Since the Mexicans have been coming across the border, the Feds have shifted their resources to them, their cartels growing plants in the thousands, armed guards, guns. Compared to them we're nothing more than mom-and-pop shops. But that does not mean that we can do what we want. It's a foolish man who underestimates his enemies. It is a stupid man who underestimates the Feds. Listen. The lark, herald of the dawn. Let's go greet it, shall we? We live off the grid, harmoniously within the systems of the earth, and we endeavor to improve this beautiful place in which we temporarily-- temporarily reside. And from this life, we farm pot. But after all of these years, I have 20 plants total, enough to get by. Any more than that and you are tempting fate. People may say I'm a criminal, And yeah-- but I live a life without greed, a life where I protect my family-- every single one of them, even you, Peter. And if we allow greed to enter into our lives then we've destroyed the very thing that we came out here for. Why did you come here? Salvation. I'm telling you this to make you aware of the vast consequences of what you may or may not be involved in on this, your little summer sojourn in the woods. I found this on my land. The Feds are here. Somebody has been sloppy, and now everything changes. What does that mean? - What are you gonna do? - Whatever I have to. So I'm gonna ask you one more time, How many plants does Max have? Jack, you're not going to believe it, but that goddamn deer ate up the rest of my roses. What are the two of you talking about? Oh, Peter here is just indulging an old man as he prattles on about the world of physics. Well, let's eat. ( whoops ) Charity! I didn't know. Why didn't you tell me? Tell me again. What did you say to Jack? I didn't say anything to Jack. - You didn't say anything? - I don't understand why-- you should have told me about the other patch. - I mean, I'm part of it. - I was gonna tell you, man, Right around harvest, but I'm glad I didn't because you would have fucking robbed me anyway! - Right? - Wow. Fuck! Wow, you've never trusted anybody. - ( siren wails ) - Shut up! ( radio sqwawking ) Where are the plants, Peter? Your friend shouldn't have bought all that equipment in one place. MAX: ( muffled ) Fuck you! PETER: You know we're lucky they let us go. MAX: They didn't get what they needed. They didn't get the plants. That's why they let us go. Apparently, miraculously, you didn't tell them where they were. So they gave us a warning. What are you doing? ( gunshots ) - Who did you shoot? - Shh! ( cocks rifle ) ( whispering ) Grab a flashlight. What? Jack? Oh my God, he killed a Fed. - ( whispering ) Jack! - Peter. ( screams ) Shh! Stop making so goddamn much noise! - Light here. - It's a deer. It's a deer! Oh! - Oh, you shot a deer! - Yes. Twice. In the head. Wow. - ( slices ) - ( blood running ) Ew. ( whispering ) Why are you cleaning it now? Because it's not deer season. So? If I leave it out, somebody will see it. It'll attract attention. That's not good, especially not now. Shine the light so I can see. What's that? That, my dear boy, is a rose. Here, try some of this steak, Hadley. Steak? Jack's a master chef. - It's not steak. - It's all in the preparation. So how's things? Good. Is there anything you want to tell me? The international dialing code for Antarctica is 672. The Feds are here, you know. I know. I just want to make sure That there's no reason for them to stick around. Are you gonna be a father now, Jack? Come on, Max. I can't help you if you're gonna-- Maybe, Dr. Truman, ( whispers ) maybe the Feds are here because they're really dying to get their hands over all that research you've been doing. Right? All that stuff you've been tooling over all these years, right, Jack? Maybe they're dying to get their fucking hands all over it. Why do you always gotta be the little shit? Oh, Charlie, what are we gonna do with him? Who's Charlie? Oh, Charlie's my first husband, Maxie's father. Max's father? - I thought Jack was-- - No. We all came up here together, Charlie, Jack and I. Charlie used to work with Jack at U.C.L.A. We were friends. We were all friends. They made quite a pair, he and Jack-- Charlie's philosophies and Jack's science-- Except when they were drinking, Which was more than when they weren't. Charlie desperately wanted to quit. And when it got bad, Charlie would have these seizures where he needed a drink. And then he found some Ecstasy from some of the kids out on the campground. It was the blue pill with the A on it and it started off awesome. It was wonderful stuff. And he started taking these pills instead of drinking and for two months he stopped cold turkey. Jack couldn't believe it. He told me he, "he did it. Charlie did it." We thought this place, the life we live, it saved him. And then one day Charlie was having one of these seizures and he really needed a drink and we didn't have any more of these pills left. And he's yelling at me to get him something and I can't find anything. And then finally I look in a drawer and I find a half tab of acid which was really old, and I said, "just take it, Charlie." It'll just take you to a different realm." And so he took it and went off. But after a while he came back and he said, "I don't know what the fuck you gave me. Every cell in my body is hurting." And I said, "oh no, let's go to the hospital." He said, "no, I'm gonna take a ride." He always liked to drive. It would calm him down. So he left. And that night, 2:00 in the morning, something woke me up. It startled me to wake up at 2:00 'cause I usually don't. And they said that's when he died. That's when he went over the cliff, Like Wile E. Coyote. I didn't know what to tell Max, So I just told him what Charlie always told him-- not to take it all too seriously. Later, we all went up to Charlie's favorite spot looking out over the cove, Jack, Maxie, and me. I was so furious, and I just stood there and I said-- "all right, Charlie, I want something spectacular. Spectacular. Spectacular! You got it?" And Jack said, "Well, the sun is setting," And I said, "Well, let's begin." And as soon as I said, "let's begin," We looked down at the cove, and there was this storm that just showed up from nowhere-- from nowhere-- and we went, "where did that come from?" And all of a sudden there was this little spark and these 50 mile-an-hour winds. And as it was growing, it had these fists coming from it, Coming up the hill. Like-- Like this. And I was going-- I mean I was-- I was screaming. I mean, I was-- Screaming. My hair's going straight up and-- I just know this is Charlie! And then the storm just cleared just like that. When a lot of shit happens and your life changes and you find yourself standing outside on a cliff, Going, "well, okay, now what?" Now I'd like to have some venison. PETER: Come back to L.A. with me. - Yeah. - I'm not joking. Seriously, why not? A clean start. You could bring Charity, Just start over, man. That could be cool. Get married, you and I. Dinner parties. - We could join a gym. - Yeah, we could join a gym. Hmm. - You sure? - No more. I mean, what do you-- You can't actually keep doing this. Max. I'm out. No you're not. Max, this is-- I can't be part of this anymore. It's gone way too far. Pete, this isn't just summer vacation, okay, man? It's too late to go home. It's too late. This is not a fucking game! ( yells ) I see just another hopeless, pathetic case, one of Bogart's parasitic fucks, you know that, Pete? Something goes wrong and the good doctor's right out the door? I'm pathetic? I'm pathetic? You're a pot farmer, Max. I achieve more in a given week Than you have in your entire life. Peter! Pete! If I don't pull this off, Charity's gonna end up just like me. ( footsteps approach ) We're playing hide and seek. Oh. Why are you so sad? Do you ever think about what you want to be when you grow up? An astronaut. How about you? I don't know. That's okay. You think so? You think that's really okay? It feels more like a waste. ( sniffs ) ROSIE: Charity, I see you! Oh, I ruined your hiding place. It'll be okay. Grandpa Jack wins again. - No. - Yes. No. That's no fair. You cheated. I don't know how you can say that. I can say you're a cheater-eater. MAN: Peter? Peter? - Dad. - Peter. How did you get here? Star 69 and Mapquest. So, Mr. Truman, what is it that you do do? ( giggles ) - I farm pot. - I'm sorry? Of course you are. What is it that you do? I'm a physician and a professor of medicine At the University of California, Los Angeles. Oh, that's wonderful! Jack and I are looking for a doctor. We need a new prescription for medical marijuana. I know it might be a bit forward given the circumstances, But I'm thinking, since you're here-- ( whispers ) it would legalize us somewhat. It would be very helpful. No. You know, I used to be a professor at U.C.L.A. Were you? And what is it that made you leave and move into the woods? Well, I didn't want to compromise my soul. All right. I think I've heard enough. Mr. and Mrs. Truman. Peter, we're going. Peter. I'm sorry. Peter. I bought you a-- pod. What? You know, those digital music players? I bought you one. I've already got one. Well, you can return it, Get something else, then. Okay. I uh--- I went ahead and passed you. What? Your final course. I passed you. Your residency starts in two weeks. ( tires screech ) Jesus! God! ( tires screech ) Max? What, you know these people? Oh shit. - Peter, what are you doing? - Just head downhill. I'll meet you at the beach. - What? - Just go to the beach! Peter, god damn it! Out out out! Out out out! ( grunts ) MAN: Hey, would you grab me one too? - Either of you seen Max? - Jack? ( grunting loudly ) Maybe I should go with you, Jack. Not a good idea. Grab a bag. Come on! MAX: Hurry up. Okay, here you go. Shh! Shh! ( whispering ) Jack, get down! ( whispering ) How the fuck did you find us? A blind man could have tracked you. ( walkie-talkies squawking ) I'm not leaving. They will kill you. You don't get to do that. - ( men muttering ) - ( helicopter whirring ) So we're gonna go stay at a motel. I'll stop by in the morning before we go. I'm sorry about everything, Max. Don't take it so seriously, man. You got any more in there? Jesus, Max. I'm sorry, Tommy. I'm sorry. ( laughing ) I guess a lifetime ban means I'll see you tomorrow, right, Tommy? - Go get some sleep, Max. - Fuck you, Tommy. # go, turn # # to the assassin # # go, repress your prudent side # # it's beautiful but plastic # Fuck. - # go, reveal darker sides # - Fuck it. - ( laughs ) - # it's beautiful... # ( sobs ) Sweetie, sweetie. ( Charity crying ) ( buzzes ) ( phone rings ) Love you, Daddy. It's really something, this place. Yeah. Yeah, it is, isn't it? Listen, Dad, I love you. Me too. I'm not taking that residency. We'll see. ( knock on door ) Hey, Jack, we're gonna take off. ( crying, breathing heavily ) Jack? It was my idea to come here. I was the one who convinced Charlie to come here. ( crying ) God, you stupid-- - Jack-- - What is this, - this fucking bullshit?! - Jack, stop! - God damn, no! No! - Jack! No, no! I got nothing, I got nothing! I got nothing! - No, that's not true. - Nothing! Nothing! Listen to me. You've got so much. You've got Rosie counting on you. You've got Charity. You've got Bogart. You've got this place, this beautiful place that can bring people back to life. Come on, Jack. You haven't passed the event horizon yet. It's okay. Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter, Yes yes yes yes, you are good, you are good. Tell Bogart thanks. Hey-- See you on Mars. ( engine starts ) You all right? I'm fine. Oh, good.
