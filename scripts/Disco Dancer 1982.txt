He asked me to tell you, not to worry. To write to him if anything is needed. But he didn't give his address. Doesn't matter. I have his address. Your father belonged to the same village. What did he do? Raju and your father sang together. Anil, your father wanted you to become a famous artist. I will. I will definitely fulfill my father's wish. First wash up and eat dinner. I'll wash up after dinner. I am famished. But how will I go to work alone? I'll come with you. You know I'll eat only when you feed me. Come inside. You sing very well. My father told me to sing from the heart not throat. - Do you play this? - Yes. Play it. - Will you sing? - Yes. I have memorized your song. Let's begin. Why do you laugh? You can't play the guitar. You don't learn just by buying it. Give it to me. Let's play inside.

Chit of a boy, arguing! Leave me, mother. Sir, what happened? Beat this rascal so hard that he never comes here! Please leave him! Please save my son! They will kill him! Please spare him! You're just in time. This boy stole my guitar. He is lying! My son is not a thief! Inspector, my life is miserable because of these lousy people. Take him away. I'll send somebody to write the FIR. I stole the guitar. He's a poor child. It caught his fancy. I couldn't bear it. Take the guitar away. Go home, child. I won't let them take my mother! Inspector, this is a lie! Neither my mother nor I am a thief! I made this bread for you. Mother... Here, eat. Don't worry. I'm waiting outside the prison. I've decided to grow up real fast. I won't spare the man in the house. Mother and son are thieves! Look at the two thieves. Why didn't you steal something precious? Shut up! My mother isn't a thief! Then why was she in jail? Leave this place and go away! I'll chop off every wagging tongue! No, my son. It won't help. One can hold a raised hand. But not a wagging tongue. But mother... Mother, you didn't commit theft. You know it. That's all. Let them speak. We'll leave this city.

Young man, you are very lucky. This is my first marriage since I was born. Congratulations. Here... Don't feel disheartened. The day I make it big, you'll be rolling in wealth. You've grown so big but want mother to feed you. Have you no shame? The food is tastier when you feed me. The day I make it big... That heartless city of ours will honor me. I'll still ask you to feed me. That day I'll remind that heartless city... ...that I am the same child ...whose mother they humiliated. Why don't you forget this? How can I forget? Never. That day is like a fresh wound on my soul. When that man abused you... The roads, trees, the breeze... nobody said a word. Not one word. That city will have to honor you. I have my music. I will sharpen it like a sword. And stab the city's heart with it. - Hi. - I'm leaving. When will you return? Can't say. I'm going to Pune. Then to Goa. If I feel like it, I might stay back after the show.

I am David Brown. Your Manager. You should know you must knock before entering anyone's room. You should know the difference between the green room and bedroom. I'm not in the mood to listen to your speech. Deliver your lecture and let me rest. Get ready when you finish. You have a show in Chandigarh. Learn how to talk to your boss. If Chandigarh wants Sam's music... Let them come to him. The audience that will wait for you tomorrow is more precious than her! You will have to come. What will you do if I say I'm not in the mood? Then I will assume your bad days... Sam can never have bad days. Sam is the heartbeat of millions of girls. Then find yourself another manager. Sam can find managers like you a dime a dozen. But a star like Sam is born once in a few centuries. And dies in a day or two. Yes, Dad. Come here. I want to talk to you. You've made a big mistake by leaving superstar Sam. Think about my show. I will be ruined! Don't worry. Dad, you called? I've left Sam. - That's a daily story. - No, the truth of the day. That tinned man! Hopes of a disco dancer! He wants me to be Secretary to a superstar! After leaving me only will he find out what I am! I will create a new superstar on the sky of the disco! Sam will drown in his light! I've already told you, you are just first grade! But... You're probably thinking Sammy's manager is crazy. By the way, I'm no longer Sammy's Manager. My mother... Good day. Your son's Manager. Please be seated. Yes, mother. This is Ghulam Nabi. He wants to do a program with Anil. He is a trifle worried. But I assured him I'll cover up the losses in the show. This should prove to you how much I trust you and your talent. Will Nicky come? Of course, she's my daughter! Why aren't you here? Sorry Dad, I can't come. You must come. My honor is at stake. Sam... What's wrong? Sam cut the line. Now what? Don't worry. The show will go on! What are you thinking? Wondering about the show. Shall I tell you? My sister, Rita and her friends must be getting ready to... ...throw their shoes at this new artist. I, David Brown am excited by the thought... ...I am instrumental in bringing a great artist to you! - We won't listen... ... to the Street Smart! Throw me the other foot. It will make a pair. Boo! We don't want him! "Turn around...

I can see you are pretty. But there's more arrogance and less delicacy in it. You probably have a brain too. But the brain stinks of wealth. I am beautiful and proud of it. My brain stinks of wealth because my Dad is a millionaire. What are you? A roadside singer? A roadside singer and dancer. That's what you screamed last night. Listen... whatever your name be... I've come to answer you. A rich man like your father condemned my art to the road. I learnt music from every footpath of Goa. I learnt pitch from each road. Last night you tried to wash away my hopes and dreams. But my mother's blessings gave me success. I swear by that same mother... One day I will be so successful... You will ask this roadside singer for his autograph. Not on a paper... On your lips. I'm not sure whether I will give the autograph. Yes, I got the cash. Book 3 tickets to Bombay. Let him get to Bombay. Everything will carry his name. Jimmy this and Jimmy that. What tea does he drink? Which cream he uses? What color does he like? What does he hate? No, I won't let Anil go to Bombay No, mother. We will go. That city has to clear old debts it owes me. We will go to Bombay. "Neither the fair nor the dark... " "The world belongs to the selfless" "Guys like us live and die with a smile" This is the house of your enemy and mind. How do you know?. I hear music. Practicing for the show?. Don't tire yourself. I have bought your program. And David Brown doesn't like third grade man like yourself! Jimmy will dance in your place. Do you follow?. I'll file a suit against you for defamation and breach of contract! Sure. When you sue me for defamation my attorney will ask you... What name? As for the breach of contract... I will honor it. You will get your money. You want to ruin me! I will deal with you! I will also sort out that artist of yours! I want to meet Vasco. Now. Don't you worry. For this much money... I will destroy the boy and his family. No... Just see that he doesn't make it to the show tonight. Don't worry. It will be done. Mother, bless me. This is my first show in Bombay. Bless you. I have been waiting for this day. May God look after you and your music. What's wrong? The car stalled. I have a show! I must be in time. Take another car. What do you guys want? I have nothing. - I am very poor. - We know you are broke. Then let me go. - You can't. - But why? Want an answer? You are mistaken. This is my first show. Let me go. Why don't you understand? I will lose everything! I apologize if I've made a mistake. Beat him black and blue so he's knocked senseless. No! Pardon? But he left long ago. But he hasn't reached here. If he doesn't make it, everything will be ruined! No! Lord Krishna... "Come to Earth" "Teach us to love" "Come to Earth" "Teach us to love" "Life is nothing but pain and thirst" "Every joy lies at your feet" "Life is nothing but pain and thirst" "Every joy lies at your feet" "Come to Earth" "Teach us to love" "Play songs of love on your flute" "We lose our hearts and live with love" "Play songs of love on your flute" "We lose our hearts and live with love" "Come... down to us" "Dear Krishna...

I wanted nothing but happiness for my mother. Even today I want nothing from life but my mother's joy. As for mother's joys... Ask her. Please lift your head. Speak out. What could a mother want? I want him to sing as long as the sun exists. And the world dances to his tune. Stop it, Sam. It doesn't affect me. What does his song have that I am lacking? - How are you? - Fine. I want to know why this man has come here. Why is he here? He ruined me and now wants to watch the fun! No. You were meant to be ruined. I have come to meet my daughter. At her house. In the world of music... Sam is finished. People will forget him in a few days. You used to have a life. Don't throw away your talent in this trash bin. Join Jimmy. See you, dear. May you live long. Once I'd said, I'll make you wealthy when I strike it big. Here. Take it. - I don't want money. - Why? I want to drink with you. No liquor. No liquor? Scotch abounds in the direction you've set off. Taste some simple liquor. Later you might not get it. That's not true. You get high on country. So be it. I still want it. - Us too... - All right. But we'll drink at the place we started from. - Let's go! - This way. Country liquor, foreign car! Hit you? My friend has come from Goa. Citizens of Bombay, salute him. Mother and son are thieves! What's up, boss? This is the same locality... ...where people called me and my mother thieves. Am I a thief? I'm not a thief. Neither is my mother. Then why did they? I'm not a thief. My mother isn't a thief. I'm not a thief! I'm not a thief! I'm not a thief! My mother isn't a thief! My mother isn't a thief. Wake up! I'm not a thief! My mother isn't a thief! My mother isn't a thief! I... I... It's Jimmy, the famous artist! I... Jimmy... The same child... ...you branded a thief and threw us out of here. Son, I'm Uncle Rahim. I'm Uncle Rahim... You are a religious man Ask your Maker... ...if I am a thief. - No... - Is my mother a thief? - No. She's a saint. She sacrificed only to see you scale the pinnacle of success. She's responsible for your success. You are right. She is an angel. Yes, she is. Every person has to pay for his deeds. These people accused you and your mother of theft. But today Oberoi's men are evicting them. Son... son... God knows when this place will be ruined. Sir, this is the man. He's killed 7 guys in London. He's a famous singer. I don't know his name. He murdered him too. The chap is a top class criminal. This year's net profit is Rs. 3654219 We're paying income tax only on 600000. We haven't been successful in evicting the slum dwellers. - Why? - Sathe is an independent MLA He is constipated. He doesn't eat a thing. He has created a problem. In such a state, the police won't help us. If the life line of the independent MLA is long... Of what use is Vasco? The slum should be vacated in 3 weeks. Have mercy... Scoundrels! Fear God! God will punish you! For God's sake... Help us, dear God! Son... Rescue us from these demons! If anyone touches another thing... I will break his hand. Put the stuff down. Why did you stop? Throw everything out. And raze the huts to the ground! It's not so simple. The soil has turned to rock with the sweat of their brow. Your welfare lies in returning. I haven't come to go back. I don't think you understand words spoken with love. Who sent you? Answer me! Speak up! Go and tell him, his Pop is no longer a kid. He has now grown up. Good God! Thank you so much. Dear... Remember me we have to go to Mayor's house for a party. Sure, I'll come. Do bring your mother too. Yes, I'll bring mother. Where are you taking me? The Mayor is throwing a party for this daughter's birthday. He has invited you too. What will I do there? Come only to see how the rich of this town hover around me. Just to get a picture taken. Will you come? He has stolen my fans. He has stolen my future! Please come... Sister, please come along. I present a gift for you... ...on the occasion on my daughter, Dolly's 18th birthday. Are you crying? Yes. I've cried after 18 years. But there's a difference in these tears and those 18 years ago. Those were the tears of an orphaned poor boy. But today's tears... ...are the tears of a popular famous artist. Amongst the guests of the evening... ...is the man who made me cry. Humiliated my mother and my childhood Seeing him again... ...has refreshed the wound. So I can't sing today. "Follow your heart" "Neither the dark nor the fair... " "The world belongs to the selfless" I'd like you to meet both my mothers today. This lady is one mother. Her name is Radha. For 18 long years... She waited for the Krishna of my future in her eyes. The pain in my voice... ...has reached my heart from hers. And my other mother... ...is the web of this city's roads. My childhood played in her lap. I walked barefoot in the blazing sun. But they never questioned me... Orphan! Stop singing! Today from the Mayor's home, I pay... ...obeisance to the roads of Bombay that mothered me. On your 18th birthday, Dolly, I present you... ...with my tears. Please cut the cake for me. The day I strike it real big... The same heartless city will honor me That day too I will ask you to feed me. Great. In today's world... The mother feeds the son. I'm fulfilling the promise given to my mother years ago. I didn't know you are him. Yes, I am... I still have the guitar. Which guitar? Meet him... The hand that slapped my mother's cheek... I can't take that hand in mien. Don't worry. Today you are not the mother of an orphan. He can neither slap you in public. Nor send you to jail on charges of theft. My wealth has bought... Honor and name. Today I'm a good citizen of this city. I'm sorry to ruin your party. You ruined my party by calling this man. I'll kill this man! Apologize or I won't spare you! Leave him! Go away... Sorry, she's really stupid. I won't spare you! Clean up. Mother... These are tears of joy. I'd told you to forget the insult. It wasn't as if I'd forgotten. That was a burden on my heart. Today you have erased it. Now I can die in peace. This city owes me nothing. Nor do I owe it a thing. You'll pay for insulting PN Oberoi... A heavy price. I've come for the autograph. Where is the book? That night when I found out... ...at the Mayor's party that you are the same... I could feel the pain of your years old wounds. I couldn't sleep. Wounds do heal. But the marks remain. I'll erase them with my love. It's a promise... You are my heart, my life. My life is with you. I'll give my life for you. Nothing matters without you. I must go. - When do we meet? - Tomorrow. Tomorrow is faraway. Learn to wait for tomorrow. Tomorrow won't come the day after but tomorrow. Give me a sweet memory to wait for the morrow. Where had you gone? Out. - With whom were you? - With Jimmy. Have you no shame going around with our enemy? First of all why would I go with him if I felt shame? Secondly he's not Sam's enemy. He's a far superior disco dancer. Someday you must watch him, listen to him... Girls from good families... ...don't dream without the parent's permission. Don't you know he's using you as a step... ...to get my wealth and honor. An orphan without a name or a family... ...who grew up in the ditches and slums... I don't like my daughter meeting him! If you must, cry in your room with the door shut! Another thing... Henceforth you won't meet anyone like Jimmy - Yes? - I can't come to meet you. Why? Mother has cooked for you. I can't come. You can't or don't want to come? My Daddy doesn't want me to see you. Do you love me? Then be ready. I'm on my way. Where is Rita? You! How dare you step in my house! The answer to this is pretty long. When I mustered up courage to live coming here didn't is no big deal. This is the home of a coward. Where are you going? A cruel father has hidden his daughter here. She loves me. I've come for her. I love her and will marry her. You may come to bless us if you have the time. You are Rita's father. I won't raise my hand. Come along. You won't step out of this house I will go. This is no longer my home. It's a prison. - The matter is... - I know. He called you in my presence. Explain this rule to Daddy. Adults aren't kidnapped. They leave of their own will. We're getting engaged on Monday. You must attend. With the family. Mother, are you happy? The auction of Vijay Mill begins. Rs. One million. Five million. Six million. Going for six million... Seven million. He wants me to lose face in business Do join in and take a seat. Eight million. Nine million. Ten million. Fifteen million. Twenty million Twenty five million. Thirty million. Thirty five million. Forty million. Fifty million. Sixty million. Seventy million. You take it. Going for sixty million. What have you done? Bought goods worth 10 million for 60! You will lose everything this way! Yes, that's what I want. I want you to walk barefoot on the streets. That's why I came to the auction. "Dancing is my life" "I love singing" "Dance and sing with me" "Friends... " "My life is indebted to songs" "That's why I was born" "People say, I could sing...

I can't bear to see the state Sam is in. I feel... There he is. What have you done to yourself? Come to your senses. Come to my senses? For what? To put up with disgrace and humiliation? Son, be brave. I will set everything right. Nobody can do anything for me. Your wealth, honor and power... That slum dweller has wrecked everything! He took your daughter away and you could do nothing. Now because of him, you will lose your son. And you'll be able to do nothing! I won't let you be hurt. Even if I have to take his life. Tomorrow Jimmy is going to a party. People will ask him to play the electric guitar. And he will play. Just as he is about to touch the electric guitar... My man will connect the strings of the guitar to 5000 Volts. Then our enemy will be demolished. Who is she? A friend of my son. - Mother. - What? Come with us. Are you a kid to walk holding mothers' finger? Mother, please come. I would if it weren't for Krishna's birth prayers. - You go on. - Mother, you... Live long. Here... Move back. Jimmy is coming! Is Jimmy there? He's gone out. The guitar Jimmy will play in the party... ...it carries a current. There's a conspiracy to kill him. What? No! You have given me so much honor here. This is the same place where as a child... I'd sing with my master, Raju for merely 10 paise. Jimmy, you'll sing today too! Yes, I will sing today. Now you must strum a song on the guitar. Mother! Did you sleep last night? How long will you stay awake? Why did she die my death? Mothers have always sacrificed themselves for their sons. Will her soul find peace seeing you in this state? But what can I do? Spread the music that is in your voice and your fingers. I can't sing... Jimmy, everyone lives their lives. And dies their own death. If you think you loved mother as much as you think... Don't consider her a corpse. She's with you every moment. With you. In the dreams she dreamed for you. She wanted your music to pulsate like a heartbeat. Keep her alive through your music. Treat your music like your mother. Sing, Jimmy. Please sing. Friends... That night some part of my... ...music, my soul must have got burnt with my mother. Hence if you find more pain in my song... Or see tears in my melody... Forgive me. No! No! Mother! No... Good news. Is Jimmy dead? Now he'll never sing. He's got guitar phobia. I mean he has a fear for the guitar. A guitar killed his mother. Now he can never touch a guitar. If ever he does get well... Vasco won't spare him. He's following him like a shadow. The prey is walking into the trap. Stop. Break his legs. Throw him into the bushes. One by one. Will he ever be able to perform on stage? Will Jimmy participate in the international disco competition? Sure, he will. - Will he win? - No doubt. - Can you tell me... - No more. One last question. Sir, we bought this for Jimmy by collecting donations. Uncle, tell him he has to get better. All the girls and boys living on the footpath of Bombay prays for him. He is one of us. Like us he grew up on the footpath of Bombay. I'll tell him. He will have to get better for you. He will sing for you on the 10th. - Will he? - Yes. Jimmy won't sing. He will die when alive. I don't want to see Jimmy alive before I die. I understand. Jimmy won't sing. If he does, it will be his last song. In the international Disco Competition... Participants from many countries are demonstrating their prowess. Now you'll enjoy the dance of Disco King and Queen of Paris. Mother!
