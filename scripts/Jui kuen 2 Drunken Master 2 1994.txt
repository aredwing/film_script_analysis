A drinker knows... ...he can't stop drinking. ls it worth being... ...a drunkard to use this move? Water floats but also capizse boats. A good thing must've something had in it. Yet a righteous fighter like Fei-hung. should be excusable for drinking a bit more. Master, your words are... ...too profound for me. Why? What is ''excusable''? How does ''water floats, also capsizes boats''? How much drink is a proper portion? l won't drink any more. You're grown. Get up, shame on you. go and thank your two friends now. Come on, thank them. ls he naughty? Don't touch him. He's asleep. Good. Come again for treatment tomorrow. Does Wong Fei-hung live here? What if he does? l want to get something from him. What's it at this late hour? l can't tell you. Did those men send you here? Skirt kick! Don't misunderstand. You old dog! What did you say? Have you had enough? You're hitting my mom? Fei-hung, let me help you. He's hitting my belly. Dad, help! Come on! Did you get hurt? l feigned only to make dad fight. You brat! Fei-hung, he's... Fei-hung. Stay where you are! Stay where you are! We'll join to kill you! l told you not to move. l told you not to move! OK. Are you all right? l'm Wong Kei-Ying. And you? You're the coach of the Militia. l'm Fu Wen-chi. The last decorated... ...Manchu officer? lt's nice seeing you. Go in. OK. Please. Come. Please. Please. Mom, what did dad say? Damn the... ...military honors. Don't you understand? You won't understand no matter how l explain. Everything's in a mess. Have you found it? No. Search closely. Fei-hung, have you got it? No. Where is it put? Finished! Finished if it can't be found. Tso. What are you doing? lt's hot. l'm keeping cool over here. You've a good sense of humor. Tso. Where's that stone l brought back? What stone? What's this? l don't know. ls it the one l brought back? l don't know. l've found it! You took it away while l was using it. Mr. Fu, you came from Beijing to Canton, and got back the jade seal. The jade seal is a Chinese Royal emblem. lt mustn't be taken away by foreigners. Right you are. Sir. There have so far been over... ...a dozen Emperors in China. Missing one jade seal is not too serious. lf you tolerate the plunder of a jade seal now, tomorrow he may... ...pull down the Great Wall. Then our children will have to go aboard... ...to see Chinese treasure. Don't you know why the Allies... ...invaded Beijing? To seize the large territory of China. Would they restain themselves... ...if you don't collect yourself? lt's but natural that might wins. You won't win respect without spines. Anyone gets bulled if he bullies himself, understand? l do. Thanks for your guidance, sir. Come on, drink. Let's drink. What happened? Why so quiet? Right. They left without saying a word. Let me go and see if Tsan has come. Where's everybody in the street? Chop them, kill them! What a crowd. Fei-hung, you got first. l'll lead. Fei-hung, grasp it. Go, sir. How's the situation? No problem. We Ax Gang... ...never miss. So much the better. Fei-hung. Come on! Sir. Undress. Undress now! OK. Catch! Follow me! After him! Run! What are you doing? No boat today. Why stand there? Go. Come quick! Sir. Stop chasing! Go. Sir. Sir. Sir. Help him up quick! Are you all right? Are you all right? Sir. Sir. Are you all right? Sir. Sir. Sir. The jade seal... Don't worry, sir, l'll get it back for you. We'll get it back for sure. Forget it. You can't beat them. Sir, hold on. l'll help you back to Po Chi Lam. My dad will treat you. Don't die. He'll help you for sure. Sir. Sir. Wake up! Sir. Sir. What's on your mind? Nothing. Tsan. Fei-hung. Why didn't you tell me you would come here? Neither did you. Have you found the jade seal? l'd have left if l had found it. Come. lt's pitch dark. Have you brought fire? Yes. Light it quick! Welcome. You want to get back this. You really are too naive. l've already taken photos of you. lntrusion into a consulate means invasion. l can punish you any way l like. Kill us if you've the guts. Good. Do you understand what l said? Yes. We planned to buy the land... ...of Po Chi Lam, but failed. Now we've thrown out those boxers Right, Po Chi Lam has been in power for too long Now it's our turn. Send someone to Po Chi Lam, and tell him his son sneaked... ...into our consulate illegally. and see what he says. Only if he agrees to sell the land... ...of Sha Min to us cheap, we'll free his son. And we can sit back and relax. He really is foolhardy. A consulate is foreign territory. Any intruders are shot on sight. l'll go and talk... ...sense with them. Sit down! You think it so easy? lt's already vexing enough... ...to have a son captured. They merely wanted to be heroes. They're not criminals. lt was all your fault. You taught him patriotism You lack the dignity of a mother. Are you blaming it on me? Try to do something, l beg you. l can't. Nor can l. The truth is obvious. The British are after the land of Sha Min. You mean giving it... ...away to them? lf he wants to be a hero, let him, and don't take him for a son. lf you won't help your son, l'll beg his mother to. Sister, your son's in trouble and now none wants to help him. Please show me your divine powers. Release them. OK, release them. Are you all right? Your mom's over there. Master Wong. Mom. They've beaten you badly. l've beaten them even worse. Auntie. Master, are you all right? Yes, only a bruise. Master, where are we moving to? What do you mean? Master Wong has sold the land in Sha Min. What? What had dad done? To help you, Master Wong did it. He sold the land... ...cheap to the consulate. Fei-hung, l covered up for you each time, but not now. You like to... ...butt in? l regret not having taken dad's advise. lt's not too late for you to repent now. Learn a lesson... ...and forget the past. Take it as a lesson. Go back. When will there be sailing for HK? ln 10 days. Have you completed production? No problem. Good. Close the factory... ...for the time being lay them off. After the shipment leaves, find cheaper workers. Yes. They always force us to work overtime. lf we refuse, they beat us up. Now they dismiss us... ...without paying. and we have... ...to starve. There are no good foreigners. Tsan, what happened? Let's talk about that later. The one who hit us is the foreman... ...of the steel factory. Right. Tsan, forget it. The less trouble the better. What? That kid's cocky. He beat us if we refused to work OT. And he stops our work at will too. Look, they've promised us nothing. How could the factory have suddenly closed? l've lately found they've... ...been acting furtively. They msut be up to no good. Fei-hung, what now? Go with Uncle Hing... ...see what's happened. ls there really something fishy? Then we'll try to do something, okay? Let's go. Looks valuable. Why's the curio hidden... ...in the steel for shipment. l'll go and tell them. Go quick. Go quick. Quick. Go quick. Go. This way. Get them! Run quick! Leave me alone! Shit! Young master, we're leaving. Go into hiding! Bye. Madam, we're leaving. Good, take care on the journey. Mind your belly. l will. Fei-hung. Dad. Keep on writing. You know what to do. l'll remember what you said. l'll visit the drought zone for a few days. Don't worry, leave everything to me. Take care now that... ...you're pregnant. l will. l must leave. Master, l want to have a word with you. lf it's a son, call him Wong Tai. Yes. lf a duaghter, call her Wong Fei. OK. You're only 4 months' pregnant, still early. lt may be premature. lt's taboo. l'll be away for a few days only. Good. Fei-hung, remember. Yes. Master Wong, time to leave. Coming. l'll rein Fei-hung in. Take good care on the road. Come back early. Take care. You may come out. They really ship away the Chinese treasure. Wonder how Uncle Hing's. l've got him involved. Don't be silly. No Chinese would tolerate... ...seeing treasures being shipped away. What now, mom? Come with me. Mom, where are you going? Beat the bastard! Dad said... Madam, you're pregnant. Only 4 months, nothing serious. Auntie, we told Master Wong... ...nothing would happen to you. Right, that son of the bitch is lucky. Tell Fun to get helpers. Fine, l'm on my way. See you at the bridgehead. Fei-hung, let's go. Come. We're leaving. Take care. Yes. lf anything happens to me, take care of my dad. Damn your dirty mouth! One without ambitions... ...is not my worthy son! l'm leaving. Fei-hung. Don't ever come back if you get beaten. Yes, mom. Protest unreasonable closure, demand reasonable compensation! Protest unreasonable closure, demand reasonable compensation! Don't get carried away What are you doing here? Go away! Hand over the treasure or we won't let you go Bullshit! You bullshit! Hand over Uncle Hing quickly... ...or we'll be nasty. So what? Throw them out! Don't move! Don't shoot! Fei-hung, come and rescue Uncle Hing! Come on! Fei-hung. Don't. Go and rescue Uncle Hing. l know where he is. Good. Keep an eye on him. Wong Fei-hung's rushing in! Stop him! Yes. Wait. Don't you know what you're doing? He's helping foreigners ship away... ...China's treasure. Why help him? State treasure? What about our empty stomach? Others will do it if they don't. l won't let you do it. Have you got the guts? We saw through... ...you as you tripped. Didn't that consulate beating hurt enough? l want to try it again. Fine, l'll get you carried away horizontally. Too much talk. Go kill him. Act! Act! Come on! Finish him off! Come on! Drag him over, quick! Drunken boxing. Just so-so. Come on. l also have a fist. Water floats but also capsizes boats Now you are beyond help Fit to it Dawn you Mr. Wong, thank your son for his efforts... ...to protect a national antique. You really are a good father. General, we might as well tell you. Master taught Fei-hung... ...drunken boxing. Really? So your drunken boxing is even more powerful? Yes, thank you. Like father like son. Where's Fei-hung? General, to demonstrate his boxing, Fei-hung wrongly took industrial... ...alcohol affecting his eyes. But the doctor said it can be treated. He's so active, he'll be sorry if he can't see anything. This is only a temporary symptom. Over here. Take photos. Let's go in to see him. Good, good. Please, please. Hang it up. He's here. What's he doing? Practicing blind boxing. Master, he's a quack. He said the alcohol not only ruined his eyes, but his brain too.
